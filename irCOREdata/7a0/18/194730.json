Introduction\nThe extent of change in the climate due to human\ninfluences is currently the subject of much debate. One\nof the environmental parameters that can be used to\ntrack climate change is sea surface temperature (SST;\nHoughton et al. 2001). Therefore, it is of importance\nthat accurate measurements of trends in SST are ob-\ntained, in order to detect climate change and to provide\na test bed for models.\nIf reliable estimates of trends are to be found,\ndatasets covering long time periods are required (Allen\net al. 1994). For SST, these exist through in situ obser-\nvations (e.g., from buoys and voluntary observing\nships) and satellite observations. Casey and Cornillon\n(2001), for example, used SSTs from the World Ocean\nAtlas 1994 and the Comprehensive Ocean\u2013Atmosphere\nData Set (COADS) to determine trends in SSTs since\n1942. They found a warming trend of between 0.09\u00b0 and\n0.14\u00b0C decade\u00021 (depending on dataset and averaging\napproach). Houghton et al. (2001) quote a global in-\ncrease of 0.14\u00b0 \u0001 0.04\u00b0C decade\u00021 between 1976 and\n2000, from Jones et al. (2001). Studies have also at-\ntempted to use satellite data alone to detect trends.\nAlthough they span relatively short time periods com-\npared to in situ data, satellite datasets have the advan-\ntage that they can provide almost global ocean cover-\nage, allowing global trends to be determined. Datasets\nmade up of in situ observations must utilize a large\nnumber of sources to achieve coverage over a wide area\nand a long time period, each of which has a different\nbias and sensitivity to observing conditions and might\nexperience drift in their measurements. Only a single\nsatellite instrument is required to achieve almost global\ncoverage of the oceans, and the entire dataset consists\nof data from only a relatively small number of similar\ninstruments. Although it is true that inconsistencies will\nexist between these instruments, effort has been put\ninto minimizing these problems, for example, the Path-\nfinder project (Kilpatrick et al. 2001).\nTwo global satellite SST datasets currently exist that\nare long enough for climate change detection. The Ad-\nvanced Very High Resolution Radiometers (AVHRRs)\nhave been operating on board National Oceanic and\nAtmospheric Administration (NOAA) polar-orbiting\nsatellites since 1981, providing a continuous source of\nSSTs. The Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR)\nseries has spanned three instruments: ATSR-1 and -2\non European Remote Sensing Satellite-1 (ERS-1) and -2,\nand Advanced ATSR on Envisat, with the data record\nCorresponding author address: Dr. G.

Using a 13-yr time series of AVHRR\ndata, Strong et al. (2000) determined that globally av-\neraged SSTs had a positive trend, although the error on\nthe trend was larger than the trend itself. Anderson et\nal. (2002), utilizing almost 8 yr of ATSR data, identified\nsignificant spatial variability in SST trends. They found\nthat the highest increases in SST were situated in the\nnorthwest Atlantic, the northwest and southwest Pa-\ncific, and in areas to the south of Africa and to the west\nof Australia. Negative trends were also found in the\nmid- and northeast Pacific and at the lowest latitudes.\nMost recently, Lawrence et al. (2004) compared global\ntrends determined from 16 yr of the Pathfinder repro-\ncessing of AVHRR data (version 4.1) and 8 yr of ATSR\ndata. Their methodology included removing the El\nNi\u00f1o component from the data, which can reduce the\nlength of time series required to detect trends with con-\nfidence by 1\u20132 yr (Allen et al. 1994). They found con-\nsistent trends of 0.09\u00b0 \u0001 0.03\u00b0 and 0.13\u00b0 \u0001 0.06\u00b0C de-\ncade\u00021 from AVHRR and ATSR, respectively. The\nconsistency between the independent datasets indicates\nthat the trends are not significantly biased by instru-\nmental drift but represent a real warming of the ocean\nsurface.\nSince Lawrence et al. (2004) published their findings,\nthe AVHRR Pathfinder dataset has reached 20 yr, po-\ntentially allowing trends to be determined with greater\nconfidence than in the previous studies (Allen et al.\n1994). In addition, the dataset has been updated to a\nnew version. In this paper we determine the SST trend\nfrom these data and discuss any differences with the\nprevious studies.\n2. Data\nThe AVHHR instruments utilized in this paper are a\nseries of space-based, nadir-viewing radiometers that\nwere designed to make measurements in five channels\nlocated at selected wavelengths in the visible, near-\ninfrared, and thermal infrared (see, e.g., Cracknell\n1997). The thermal infrared channels, namely, channels\n4 (10.5\u201311.5 \u0003m) and 5 (11.5\u201312.5 \u0003m), are calibrated\nthrough views of a blackbody at around 290 K and cold\nspace. The spatial resolution of the channels is 4 km \u0004\n4 km in global mode with a swath width of approxi-\nmately 2900 km. One of the applications of its data is to\nmake accurate retrievals of SST from the thermal chan-\nnels. The Pathfinder SST dataset is a historical repro-\ncessing of AVHRR data (beginning in 1985), which\nuses a consistent retrieval methodology over all the in-\nstruments and attempts to improve the calibration be-\ntween the instruments in the AVHRR series to provide\na high-quality dataset for climate change detection.\nTwo versions of the Pathfinder dataset are utilized in\nthis study, version 4.1 and version 5.\nThe Pathfinder retrieval uses a nonlinear algorithm\nto calculate SST from the radiances recorded by the\ninstrument. The form of the algorithm is (Walton et al.\n1998; Kilpatrick et al. 2001)\nSSTsat \u0005 a \u0006 bT4 \u0006 c\u0007T4 \u0002 T5\bSSTguess\n\u0006 d\u0007T4 \u0002 T5\b\tsec\u0007\u0001\b \u0002 1\n.\nThe algorithm requires radiances recorded in two of\nthe AVHRR channels T4 and T5 (centered at 10.8 and\n11.4 \u0003m), a first-guess SST value (SSTguess), the satellite\nzenith angle (\u000b), and a set of four coefficients (a, b, c,\nand d) in order to calculate SST. The coefficients are\ndetermined empirically by regression to in situ SST\ndata from buoys, and for each month the coefficients\nare calculated by a weighted average over the 5 months\ncentered on that month. There are two periods in the\ndata record that do not follow this approach. First is the\nperiod following the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in\n1991, which injected large amounts of aerosol into the\nstratosphere and increased the atmospheric correction\nrequired in the retrieval (Kilpatrick et al. 2001). Sec-\nond, version 4.1 data from January 2000 onward and\nversion 5 data from January 2002 onward are currently\ninterim versions. This means that coefficients from the\nprevious year have been used to retrieve SST. The\nsame coefficients are used for day and night (Kilpatrick\net al. 2001). The datasets use data from a number of\ndifferent AVHRRs on different polar-orbiting satel-\nlites; these are NOAA-9 (4 January 1985\u20137 November\n1988), NOAA-11 (8 November 1988\u201313 September\n1994), NOAA-9 (14 September 1994\u201321 January 1995),\nNOAA-14 (22 January 1995\u201311 October 2000), NOAA-\n16 (12 October 2000\u201331 December 2002), and NOAA-\n17 (1 January 2003\u2013present) (see http:\/\/www.nodc.\nnoaa.gov\/sog\/pathfinder4km\/userguide.html).\nThere are three principal differences between the\nversion 4.1 and version 5 datasets (source: http:\/\/www.\nnodc.noaa.gov\/sog\/pathfinder4km\/userguide.html).\nThese are\n(i) improved spatial resolution\u2014version 5 datasets\ncan be obtained on equal-angle grids of size 8196\npixels \u0004 4096 pixels, compared to 4096 \u0004 2048\npixels for version 4.1 data;\n(ii) improved ice mask identification\u2014the Special\nSensor Microwave Imager (SSM\/I) and the Reyn-\nolds optimal interpolation SST dataset are used to\nidentify regions containing ice; and\n(iii) improved land mask\u2014a new 1-km resolution land\nmask developed from Moderate Resolution Imag-\ning Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data is used for\n1256 J O U R N A L O F C L I M A T E VOLUME 20\nversion 5 data, compared to a 9-km mask used for\nversion 4.1. This is then degraded to the resolution\nof the version 5 SST product.\nAVHRR Pathfinder SST data (version 4.1 and ver-\nsion 5) were downloaded from the Physical Oceanog-\nraphy Distributed Active Archive Center (PO.DAAC;\nhttp:\/\/podaac.jpl.nasa.gov) and National Oceano-\ngraphic Data Center (NODC; http:\/\/www.nodc.noaa.\ngov). These datasets are monthly averages, with the\nformer on a 54-km equal-angle grid and the latter at\n4-km spatial resolution.\n3. Methodology\nWhile time series of SST anomalies show much short-\nterm natural variability, it is the goal of studies such as\nthese to make an assessment of the longer-term\nchanges in temperature over the period of data cover-\nage. A number of studies have applied trend models to\nsurface or air temperature data, concluding that linear\ntrend and breakpoint models are appropriate to global\nanalyses, for example, Zheng and Basher (1999) and\nSiedel and Lanzante (2004), rather than random walk\nmodels with no deterministic trends as suggested as po-\ntentially plausible by Woodward and Gray (1993).\nSiedel and Lanzante (2004) performed a detailed study\nemploying flat-step models, piecewise linear models,\nsloped-step models, and linear models with fits to a\nnumber of datasets. Where abrupt changes could be\nidentified in datasets, for example, in 1946 and 1977,\nmultipart models were preferred. However, in both the\nportion of the surface temperature record beyond 1977\nand in fits to 1979\u20132001 tropospheric temperature\ndatasets from satellites and radiosondes, no such abrupt\nchanges could be identified and linear trends were de-\nduced. In the case of the 1979\u20132001 datasets, a linear\ntrend with the first-order autoregressive [AR(1)] model\nwas found to best explain data records. Therefore, this\nis the model that is adopted for our analysis.\nOur methodology is equivalent to that of Lawrence\net al. (2004) in that the seasonal cycle and the influence\nof El Ni\u00f1o are removed from the SST datasets, allowing\nthe trend due to other natural processes and anthropo-\ngenic influences to be determined. However, rather\nthan performing these steps separately as in Lawrence\net al. (2004) we adapt the formulism of Weatherhead et\nal. (1998) to find the seasonal cycle, influence of El\nNi\u00f1o, and trend simultaneously, and then to calculate\nthe error on the trend. In brief, the analysis consists of\nthe following steps.\nWe adopt the criterion of Lawrence et al. (2004) of\nrequiring continuous data at a spatial point throughout\nthe time series if they are to be included in the analysis.\nThis avoids the possibility of trends being biased by a\nlack of data points. Therefore, the data are first aver-\naged to 2.5\u00b0 spatial resolution in order to minimize any\ndata gaps due to cloud and to achieve near-global cov-\nerage. Only data flagged as having the highest quality in\nthe Pathfinder auxiliary information (flag value of\nseven) were used. Any grid cells that did not have con-\ntinuous data throughout the time series are ignored in\nthe following analysis.\nThe strength of El Ni\u00f1o during each month of the\ntime series is then determined as in Lawrence et al.\n(2004). An empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analy-\nsis is performed on the region of the eastern Pacific cold\ntongue (10\u00b0S\u201310\u00b0N, 150\u00b0\u201375\u00b0W) after first removing\nthe seasonal cycle at each spatial point (found by aver-\naging the data for each January together, each Febru-\nary together, etc.). The disappearance of the cold\ntongue is one of the characteristics of an El Ni\u00f1o event,\nand hence changes in SST in this region can be used to\ninfer the occurrence and strength of El Ni\u00f1o. After the\nseasonal cycle, the dominant mode of variability in the\nregion (represented by the first EOF) is the change in\nSST due to El Ni\u00f1o. The corresponding principal com-\nponent (PC) time series, obtained by projecting the\nEOF back onto the data, then provides a function rep-\nresenting the strength of El Ni\u00f1o.\nA model containing the expected variability within\nthe SST datasets is then fitted to a time series of glo-\nbally averaged SSTs using a nonlinear least squares fit-\nting function that is part of Interactive Data Language\n(IDL). The global averages are produced by finding the\nmean of all the 2.5\u00b0 \u0004 2.5\u00b0 grid cells, weighted by the\nsurface area of the earth represented by each cell. The\nmodel (adapted from Weatherhead et al. 1998) is\nTt \u0005 \u0002 \u0006 St \u0006\n1\n12\n\u0003t \u0006 \u0004PCt,\nwhere global-average SST (T) at time t (in months) is\ndescribed by a constant term (\u0003), a seasonal component\n(St), a linear trend of rate \f \u00b0C year\n\u00021, and a constant\n(\r) multiplied by the function PCt obtained previously\nthat represents the strength of El Ni\u00f1o. The seasonal\ncomponent is represented by Weatherhead et al.

The remaining variability \u0011t is assumed to be ran-\ndom with variance \u00122\u0011. The factor \u0010 is determined by\nfitting a model Rt \u0005 \u0010Rt\u00021 to the residuals to obtain \u0010 ;\nthen \u0012\u0011 is found by calculating the standard deviation of\nany variability still not explained.

Results\nFigure 1 shows the coverage of the globe when 2.5\u00b0\nspatial averaging and the criterion for continuous data\ncoverage is applied. There are some notable gaps in the\ndata coverage, for example, in the western Atlantic and\nnorthern Pacific Oceans in the daytime data and off the\nwest coasts of South America and Africa in the night-\ntime image. The effect of these missing spatial points is\ndiscussed in section 5. While the averages used in this\nwork are described as \u201cglobal,\u201d in practice it can be\nseen that because of the strict criterion of having con-\ntinuous data throughout the time series, the coverage\ntoward the poles is relatively poor. Overall the global\naverages consist of temperatures from 72% of the\nWorld Ocean for both day and night. Increasing this\npercentage could be achieved by relaxing the continu-\nous coverage criterion, or by performing some kind of\ninterpolation to fill in data cells that do not have data.\nWe have not attempted either of these since, as dis-\ncussed in Lawrence et al. (2004), these methods could\npotentially introduce biases into the trends.\nThe PCs corresponding to the strength of El Ni\u00f1o,\nobtained from the EOF analysis, are shown in Fig. 2.\nThe correlation between the day and night PCs is very\nhigh (r \u0005 0.99). The PCs also have high correlations\nwith the Southern Oscillation index (r \u0005 \u00020.62; data\nobtained from http:\/\/www.cgd.ucar.edu\/cas\/catalg\/\nclimind\/soi.html; see Trenberth 1984) and the Multi-\nvariate El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation index (r \u0005 0.89;\ndata obtained from http:\/\/www.cdc.noaa.gov\/people\/\nklaus.wolter\/MEI\/mei.html; see Wolter and Timlin\n1993, 1998), suggesting that this EOF approach is valid.\nIn addition, clear peaks can be seen in the PCs around\nFIG. 1.

As might\nbe expected, the constant term (\u0003) is warmer for the\ndaytime data than for the night, by 0.139 K. The values\nof the \u000f terms describe the seasonal cycle found by the\nfit. Correlation of the seasonal cycles determined using\nthis method with those obtained by averaging the data\nfor each month (as used by Lawrence et al. 2004) yields\nvery high correlation coefficients (0.9998 and 0.9997),\nsuggesting that the methods are consistent and that the\nparameterization used in the model is valid.\nFigures 3 and 4 show the data with the model over-\nplotted. The center panels show the SST anomalies re-\nsulting from subtracting only the seasonal cycle com-\nponent of the model from the data. The lower panels in\nthe plots show the difference between the data and the\nmodel. The effect of the El Ni\u00f1o component of the\nmodel can be seen clearly in the increased temperatures\nduring the strong El Ni\u00f1o years of 1987 and 1997. There\nis some evidence that the global effect of El Ni\u00f1o con-\ntinues longer than determined from the EOF analysis,\nfrom the high anomalies and residuals immediately af-\nter the 1987 and 1997 events. Indeed, Lawrence et al.\n(2004) identified global El Ni\u00f1o effects related to the\n1997 event with a time lag of 14 months. The linear\ntrends determined by the fits are 0.18\u00b0 and 0.17\u00b0C de-\ncade\u00021 for day and night, respectively. If the El Ni\u00f1o\ncomponent of the model is not included, these are both\nincreased by 0.01\u00b0C. Therefore, El Ni\u00f1o only has a\nweak influence on the measured trends, despite being\nthe strongest mode of natural variability in the data,\nafter the seasonal cycle.\nThe residuals of the fit show considerable structure.\nFor example, there are negative residuals between 1991\nand 1995. These are likely to be associated with cooling\ndue to the ejection of aerosols into the stratosphere by\nthe Mount Pinatubo eruption of 1991. Lawrence et al.\n(2004) investigated these cool anomalies using in situ\ndata. They concluded that the satellite instruments\nwere recording a real cooling of the surface during this\ntime, rather than the low temperatures being due to a\nretrieval bias. The structure in the residuals is reflected\nin a histogram of the values, which shows clear differ-\nences from the best-fitting Gaussian distribution (Fig.\n5), and in the high values of \u0010 (0.843 and 0.860 for day\nand night, respectively). This suggests that over the\ntime series the residuals in a month are well correlated\nwith the residuals in the previous month. After removal\nof the correlated portion of the residuals, the histogram\nof the data is very close to Gaussian (Fig. 6), indicating\nTABLE 1.

The random compo-\nnent of the residuals model was calculated to have stan-\ndard deviations of 0.056\u00b0 and 0.058\u00b0C for day and night,\nrespectively.\nFrom the above values, the standard deviations of\nthe measured trends were determined to be 0.04\u00b0 and\n0.05\u00b0C decade\u00021 for the daytime and nighttime\ndatasets, respectively. Therefore, the trends calculated\nfrom SSTs retrieved from daytime and nighttime data\nare consistent to within error and demonstrate with\n\u001499.9% certainty that SSTs have increased globally\nover the past two decades. However, it should be noted\nthat the values of \u0010 also have an uncertainty associated\nwith them, which in turn causes some uncertainty in the\nstandard deviations of the trends. Adopting the stan-\ndard deviations of the random variability in the residu-\nals calculated above, the 1 \u0012 error on the values of \u0010\ndetermined in the fit were found to be 0.035 for daytime\ndata and 0.033 for nighttime data. The corresponding\nchange in the calculated standard deviation of the\ntrends if the value of \u0010 is under- or overestimated by 1\n\u0012 is an increase or decrease of 0.01\u00b0C decade\u00021, respec-\ntively (day and night). Neglecting the El Ni\u00f1o compo-\nnent of the model also changes the standard deviations\nof the trends, increasing them by 0.01\u00b0C decade\u00021.\nHence, removing natural variability such as that due to\nEl Ni\u00f1o increases the confidence in the trend.\n5.

This trend is consistent, within\nerrors, to those determined by Casey and Cornillon\n(2001), Houghton et al. (2001), and Lawrence et al.\n(2004), where ATSR data were used. However, the\nmost comparable trend to those found in this paper is\nthat determined by Lawrence et al. (2004) using\nAVHRR Pathfinder daytime data. They found the SST\ntrend to be 0.09\u00b0 \u0001 0.03\u00b0C decade\u00021. The two trends\nare different by over twice the error on our trend de-\ntermination (three times if their error is used), despite\nthe data source being the same. Here we investigate the\npossible reasons for this:\n(i) Lawrence et al. (2004) looked at a shorter time\nspan of data, spanning between 1985 and 2001.\nRestricting our analysis to the time period they\nused decreases our daytime trend to 0.13\u00b0 \u0001\n0.05\u00b0C decade\u00021, giving much better agreement\nwith the results of Lawrence et al. (2004).\n(ii) Lawrence et al. (2004) performed their analysis\nslightly differently, first removing the seasonal\ncycle and El Ni\u00f1o, then determining a trend from\nthe resultant anomalies. Retaining the shortened\ntime period and performing the analysis in this\nway also results in a trend of 0.13\u00b0C decade\u00021,\nsuggesting that the two analysis procedures are\nequivalent. If the Lawrence et al. (2004) method of\ncalculating error and their estimate of the error on\neach global average (0.16\u00b0C) are assumed, the er-\nror on the trend is found to be \u0001 0.03\u00b0C decade\u00021.\nHowever, this error estimate does not attempt to\ntake into account the autocorrelation of the re-\nsiduals.\n(iii) Lawrence et al. (2004) used an older version of\nPathfinder dataset than that utilized in this study.\nThe trend determined here by performing our\nanalysis on Pathfinder version 4.1 data over the\nrestricted time period was 0.09\u00b0 \u0001 0.04\u00b0C de-\ncade\u00021. This trend is identical to that found by\nLawrence et al. (2004) with AVHRR version 4.1\ndata, again confirming the equivalence of the\nanalysis methods. Therefore, changing the version\nof the Pathfinder data that is used has changed the\nmeasured trend by 0.04\u00b0C decade\u00021.\nEnhancements that were introduced into version 5 of\nthe Pathfinder dataset compared to version 4.1 are im-\nproved spatial resolution, ice mask identification,\nand land mask (source: http:\/\/www.nodc.noaa.gov\/sog\/\npathfinder4km\/userguide.html). The newer dataset\nmay therefore include data closer to land. It is also\npossible that trends determined from the older dataset\nwere biased by the incorrect inclusion of ice or land\npixels or the exclusion of sea pixels. In addition, since\nclimate trends are not uniform over the globe, but show\nsignificant regional differences, the difference in masks\nthat mark where data gaps due to cloud and land lie in\nthe datasets could affect the trends. Therefore, this\ncould be the reason, or part of the reason, for the dif-\nferences that have been identified between version 4.1\nand version 5 Pathfinder trends. The spatial pattern of\ntrends was determined by performing our analysis on\nthe data for each grid cell individually, rather than on\nthe global averages. Figure 7 shows the resulting trends\nfrom the day and night data over the full time period of\nFIG. 7. Spatial pattern of trends in SST from (top) daytime and\n(bottom) nighttime AVHRR Pathfinder version 5 data over the\nperiod from January 1985 to December 2004.\n1 APRIL 2007 G O O D E T A L . 1261\nFig 7 live 4\/C\nPathfinder version 5 data. These patterns seem consis-\ntent with those observed by Strong et al. (2000) and\nAnderson et al. (2002). In the spatial maps, high warm-\ning trends (\u00140.5\u00b0C decade\u00021) are observed at the\nnorthern limits of the coverage, as well as off the west-\nern coast of Africa. Negative trends are also seen, for\nexample, in the northeastern Pacific and in the south-\nern oceans.\nIt was noted in section 4 that the cloud and land\nmasks for the daytime and nighttime data differed, al-\nthough the measured climate trends were not signifi-\ncantly different. To determine if the trend measured\nfrom version 4.1 data is being affected by the differing\ncloud and land masks, a consistent mask for both\ndatasets was determined; that is, a mask was produced\nthat marked where continuous data were present in\nboth version 4.1 and version 5 datasets over the time\nperiod analyzed by Lawrence et al. (2004). Figure 8\nshows the resulting times series of SST anomalies for\nthe two versions of the data after removal of the sea-\nsonal cycle. While similar features can be seen in the\ndatasets, the anomalies are noticeably higher toward\nthe end of the time series in the version 5 data. This is\nparticularly obvious at the beginning of 1996 and the\nend of 2000. The trends determined in the analysis for\nthe shortened time period, 1985\u20132001, were 0.09\u00b0 \u0001\n0.05\u00b0C decade\u00021 for daytime version 4.1 data and 0.13\u00b0\n\u0001 0.05\u00b0C decade\u00021 for daytime version 5 data. These\ntrends are identical to those determined when differing\nmasks were used.\nFigure 9 shows the difference in trend in each grid\ncell between the two versions of the data (version 5\nminus version 4.1). In the plot, the cyan colors indicate\nno difference in the measured trend. Negative differ-\nences in the trends (colored blue) can be seen in the El\nNi\u00f1o region. The highest positive differences (yellow\nand red colors) are seen around the land and toward\nthe most northern and southern parts of the data cov-\nerage, where the occurrence of cloud and ice may have\nprevented there being continuous data. These differ-\nences may therefore be related to the changes in land\nand ice maps. However, green colors, representing\nsmaller positive differences, are observed almost every-\nwhere else. Therefore, the difference in the globally\naveraged SST trends between the two versions of the\ndatasets cannot be attributed solely to a particular re-\ngion of the globe.\nThe error on the trend measured with the newer\ndataset has also increased by 0.01\u00b0C decade\u00021. This is\ndue to the value of \u0010 being larger for the version 5\ndataset than for version 4.1 (0.840 compared to 0.789),\nwhile the standard deviation of the random component\nof the residuals model is 0.054\u00b0C for version 5 and\n0.050\u00b0C for version 4.1. This indicates that the changes\nthat were made to the Pathfinder processing between\nversion 4.1 and version 5 has included or excluded\nSSTs, or changed the retrieved temperatures, in such a\nway that a greater autocorrelation is seen in the residu-\nals. This demonstrates that while version 5 of the Path-\nfinder dataset can be thought of as an improvement\nFIG. 8. Comparison of the time series of the averaged SSTs with\nthe seasonal cycle removed from version 4.1 (\u0006 symbols) and 5.0\n(\u0004) daytime datasets, with the models overlaid. The version 5.0\ndata have been offset vertically for clarity. To provide a direct\ncomparison, the averages are formed only from grid cells where\nthere are data throughout both versions of the data.\nFIG. 9. Differences between the SST trends measured using\nversion 5 and version 4.1 daytime data at each spatial grid point.\nThe differences shown are version 5 \u0002 version 4.1 trends.\n1262 J O U R N A L O F C L I M A T E VOLUME 20\nFig 9 live 4\/C\nover version 4.1, this does not necessarily mean that a\ntrend can be determined to greater precision.\nIt is therefore possible to conclude that the change in\ndata between versions of the Pathfinder datasets have\nresulted in an increase in the measured trend. However,\nthis difference is less than one standard deviation in the\nmeasured trend and does not account for the full dif-\nference between the Lawrence et al. (2004) trend and\nthat found in this paper. Extending the datasets beyond\nthe time period used by Lawrence et al. (2004) also\nresults in an increase in the measured trend; this is true\nof version 4.1 data as well as the version 5 dataset\u2014\nwhen a time span of version 4.1 data of January 1985 to\nJune 2003 is used, the trend is increased to 0.13\u00b0 \u0001\n0.04\u00b0C decade\u00021. Therefore, the later part of the time\nperiod appears to be increasing the measured trend.\nHowever, within errors, the trends determined from the\ntwo time periods agree. Data extending the record be-\nyond 2004 are required in order to understand these\ndifferences fully and to investigate the changes that oc-\ncur in the 2001\u201304 period.\n6. Conclusions\nThe AVHRR Pathfinder dataset (version 5) now ex-\ntends to 20 yr of continuous data. These span the period\nfrom January 1985 to December 2004, inclusive, and\nhave been used to study the global trend in SST over\nthat time period. The data, which were obtained as\nmonthly averages, were further averaged to 2.5\u00b0 reso-\nlution, and any spatial points without continuous data\nwere discarded to avoid biasing the trend measure-\nments. A model consisting of a constant term, a sea-\nsonal cycle, an El Ni\u00f1o component, and a linear trend\nwas fitted to global averages of the SSTs. The trend in\nSST was found to be 0.18\u00b0 \u0001 0.04\u00b0 and 0.17\u00b0 \u0001 0.05\u00b0C\ndecade\u00021 from daytime and nighttime data, respec-\ntively. The influence of El Ni\u00f1o on the trend was found\nto be weak compared to the error on the trend mea-\nsurement; when the El Ni\u00f1o component of the model\nwas removed, the measured trends increased by only\n0.01\u00b0C decade\u00021. However, the standard deviation of\nthe trend also increased by 0.01\u00b0C decade\u00021. Evidence\nof cool temperatures after the eruption of Mount Pi-\nnatubo in 1991 ejected aerosol into the stratosphere\nwas also seen.\nThe trends determined in this paper are higher than\nthat obtained by Lawrence et al. (2004) when using\nAVHRR Pathfinder data. The differences can be at-\ntributed to changes in the data between version 4.1 and\nversion 5 of the Pathfinder dataset and to the time pe-\nriod over which the trend was measured. The former\nresulted in a difference of 0.04\u00b0C decade\u00021 in the trend,\nwhile ending the time series in December 2000 resulted\nin a trend that was 0.05\u00b0C decade\u00021 less. The difference\nresulting from the extension of the time series is of\nsimilar magnitude to the error on the trend. As the data\nrecord extends over the forthcoming years it will be\npossible to determine if these most recent years are\nanomalous, resulting in a high trend, or if the trend\ndetermined from the shorter dataset was low. In con-\nclusion, these results demonstrate with high certainty\nthat SSTs have increased globally over the past two\ndecades, with an indication of an increased rise in re-\ncent years.\nAcknowledgments.
