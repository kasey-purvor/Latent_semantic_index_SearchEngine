For example, the anodization process that has\nbeen commonly used in the past5 does not work well for very\nthin layers. Also the junction formed as a result of the im-\nplantation has a depletion region associated with it which\nlimits the extent of the profile which can be measured. We\nhave considered these problems and have developed a\nmethod for determining the electrical profiles by using\ndouble implants of antimony and an improved method for\nremoving thin layers s1\u20132 nmd uniformly and reproducibly\nso that the differential Hall technique can be utilised.\nP-type (100) Si wafers of resistivity of 2\u201310 V cm were\nimplanted at room temperature with 531014 Sb+ cm\u22122 at\n5 keV. To facilitate the measurement of the carrier profile, a\nsecond implant of 331013 Sb+ at 70 keV was performed\ninto part of the wafer. This produces an antimony concentra-\ntion of 1018\u20131019 cm\u22123 in the tail of the 5 keV implant and\nmoves the n+ \/ p junction deep s<80 nmd into the material.\nAll the implants were performed using a 200 kV Danfysik\n1090 accelerator. The wafers were annealed at temperatures\nof 600\u20131100 \u00b0C for 10 s in a flowing nitrogen ambient.\nElectrical measurements were performed on cloverleaf\nsamples using an Accent HL5900 Hall system with In\/Ga\neutectic used for ohmic contact formation.\nFor differential Hall effect profiling, we have developed\na native oxide growth and strip process, since the conven-\ntional anodization technique5 does not give the necessary\nreproducibility and control at the nanometer level. The pro-\ncess is to immerse the sample into de-ionized water for 10 s,\nwhich enables the growth of a very thin oxide. The sample is\nthen washed and dried before measurement of the sheet Hall\ncoefficient and sheet resistance with the oxide in place. Sub-\nsequently, the oxide is removed in 5% buffered hydrofluoric\nacid and the process of oxidation and measurement repeated\nuntil the end of the profile is reached. The total amount of\nsilicon removed is measured using a Rank\u2013Taylor\u2013Hobson\nTalystep and the etch rate determined knowing the total num-\nber of oxidation steps performed. The etch rate (oxide thick-\nness) can be varied over a small range s0.7\u20132.5 nmd by\nchanging the time s5\u201320 sd that the sample spends in the\nde-ionized water. The total etch step is measured for each\nsample and is found to lie in the range 2\u00b10.3 nm for the\nsamples studied in this work. The antimony atomic profiles\nwere measured by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS)\ncarried out using a Cameca IMS 6F with a primary beam\nenergy of 1.5 keV O2+.\nThe electrical activation and sheet resistance measured\nas a function of the annealing temperature for the single en-\nergy 5 keV antimony implant is shown in Fig. 1. For the\nrange of annealing conditions investigated, the sheet resis-\ntance increases and the electrical activation decreases with\nincreasing annealing temperature. The uncertainty in the\nmeasurement of electrical activation is \u00b12.5%.\nWe observe a decrease in the electrical activation from\n60% to 16% and an increase in the sheet resistance from\n430 to 770 V \/ square with increasing annealing temperature\nfrom 600 to 1100 \u00b0C (Fig. 1).

The sheet mobility increases from about 50 cm2\/V s\nat 600 \u00b0C to 100 cm2\/V s at 1100 \u00b0C, which is associated\nwith a decrease in carrier concentration and the removal of\ndefects as a result of the higher temperature anneals.\nFigure 2 compares an atomic profile s600 \u00b0Cd with two\ncarrier profiles after annealing the single energy s5 keVd im-\nplants at 600 and 800 \u00b0C for 10 s. The two carrier profiles\nare very similar. However, it is only possible to measure part\nof the carrier distribution because of the close proximity of\nthe n+ \/ p junction and the high resistance associated with the\nresulting depletion region. A peak carrier concentration of\n3\u2013431020 cm\u22123 is obtained, which is similar to the value\nreported by Nylansted-Larsen et al.6 for 80 keV implants.\nThe atomic profiles are identical for these two annealing\ntemperatures, whilst the carrier concentration is also the\nsame within experimental error. Thus diffusion of antimony\nis absent under these annealing conditions. The atomic pro-\nfile for the as implanted material (not shown) agrees with\nthose measured after annealing at 600 \u00b0C (Figs. 2 and 3) and\n800 \u00b0C (not shown).\nComplete electrical profiles have been measured using\nthe double implant s5 keV+70 keVd and Fig. 3 illustrates the\ndifferences between three profiles which quantifies typical\nvariations observed and the reproducibility of the profiling\ntechnique. Here the peak carrier concentration is lower\n(about 231020 cm\u22123) than the value measured for the single\nenergy implant (Fig. 3). This may be due to the better sensi-\ntivity that we have using the double implant scheme or it\nmay be due to a net reduction in vacancy concentration in the\nnear surface region as a result of the deeper implant, which\nreduces the carrier concentration. However, we have found\npeak carrier concentrations of about 231020 cm\u22123 for\n40 keV implants.7 The carrier profiles (Fig. 3) follow the\natomic profile quite closely in the tail region. The deeper,\n70 keV antimony implant has not become fully activated, but\nhas produced carrier concentrations in the range up to 2\n31018 cm\u22123. Thus we can confidently conclude that the\njunction depth, defined here as the depth at which the carrier\nconcentration falls to 1018 cm\u22123, is 22\u00b11 nm, which agrees\nwith the atomic profiles of Figs. 2 and 3.\nFor all samples, the uniformity of the oxidation process\nis quantified by measuring the ratio of the sheet resistance\nbetween each pair of contacts following each oxidation step.\nFor ideal samples this ratio should be unity and remain so\nuntil the end of the profile determination. Large changes in\nthe ratio s.1.5d are sometimes observed and in these cases\nthe results are ignored, because the oxidation process has not\nremained uniform with depth.\nWe have demonstrated a modified differential Hall effect\ntechnique for the measurement of carrier profiles of shallow\nlayers in silicon. The use of a higher energy s70 keVd im-\nplant enables the measurement of the complete electrical pro-\nfile for 5 keV antimony. This technique has required the de-\nvelopment of a reproducible oxidation process for removing\nmaterial in order to facilitate the differential Hall measure-\nments. The junction depth of 22 nm was essentially that of\nthe as-implanted atomic profile, determined by SIMS, so no\nmeasurable diffusion of the antimony occurred below\n800 \u00b0C, where optimum electrical results were obtained.\nThe authors would like to thank the Kuwait Govern-\nment, the University of Surrey Ion Beam Centre, and the UK\nEngineering and Physical Sciences Research Council for\ntheir financial support of this project.
