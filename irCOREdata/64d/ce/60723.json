Introduction \nThe future directions of the geoscience knowledge system and therefore of geological survey \norganizations will be influenced by many external forces. Of these, the developing network of \nsupport services based on computing, information and communications technology (the \ncyberinfrastructure) is particularly noteworthy. It affects the way surveyors collect, represent \nand communicate their ideas, and in consequence their view of the geology. The surveying \nprocess takes place where knowledge of the solid Earth is tested, enhanced and extended by \nrelating it to its real-world counterpart. The core of that knowledge is at present represented \nlargely by lithostratigraphic maps and associated documents. Potentially, it will be supported \nby a cyberinfrastructure that will provide the mechanisms for knowledge representation and \ncommunication, along with the computing power to model solid-Earth systems as a \ncomponent of a global knowledge system.  \nConsequences for four aspects of the system, each calling for different types of expertise, are \noutlined here. They can be described by models (in the sense of conceptual constructs \nrepresenting a simplified view of reality for a particular purpose) and their interactions. They \nare: the infrastructure model (how knowledge is represented, stored and communicated); the \nbusiness model (why surveys are undertaken); the geological framework model (how \ngeological information is organized); and the surveying methods model (how the survey is \ncarried out). Consideration of all these aspects is required for practical forward planning. \n \n2. Cyberinfrastructure model  \nThe model of the cyberinfrastructure represents the structure, mechanisms and facilities to \nstore, process and communicate representations of global aspects of knowledge. The physical \nmanifestations of geological records are regarded in this paper as an infrastructure component \n(Fig. 1). Cyberinfrastructure design is primarily the concern of \u2018e-scientists\u2019. But the \ngeological community has a responsibility to respond to its development, and to ensure that \nthe design takes its specific requirements into account.  \n Loudon, T.V., 2009. Four interacting aspects of a geological survey knowledge system               2\n \nFigure 1: Relationships of four models in a survey knowledge system, as explained in \nthe text. Arrows show information flow. \n \nThe cyberinfrastructure is reacting to exponential growth in computing power, \ncommunications bandwidth and storage capacity, as the Internet acquires features of the \nsemantic Grid1. The Grid (Foster and Kesselman, 2003) is seen as supplying information \n(representing aspects of knowledge) as a commodity, and the semantic aspect implies an \ninterest in incorporating interpretative reasoning processes. Unrestricted by artificial \nboundaries of geography or discipline, the Grid should support the worldwide extent of \ngeology, and strengthen the links to other disciplines. Many geological processes and events \nof particular concern to mankind involve interactions among the lithosphere, hydrosphere, \natmosphere and biosphere. Their separate disciplinary approaches can be unified in the \nconcepts of Earth systems science (National Research Council, 1993), and supported by a \nformal framework and exploratory apparatus2 from computer science, are appropriate for Grid \nimplementation.  \nThe semantic Grid should thus enable knowledge from many fields to be readily brought to \nbear on geological issues, and vice versa. Shared standards, concepts, ontologies and \ninteroperable models facilitate collaborative work across related fields of study. They should \nmake it possible to combine information and software from many sources, and make it \navailable to a wide range of application fields, using methods such as the Service-Oriented \nKnowledge Utility3. In response, some geological surveys are changing the emphasis of their \nbusiness model4: away from publishing geological maps and related documents; towards \n                                                          \n1 Semantic Grid Community Portal. http:\/\/www.semanticgrid.org\/  \n2 Emmott, S.

Four interacting aspects of a geological survey knowledge system               3\ncontributing to a whole-Earth knowledge system, from which users can obtain flexible \nresponses to match their specific needs. \n \n3. Business models \nBusiness models that set out the objectives of a geological investigation are primarily the \nconcern of geological management. They arise in many diverse activities, for example, \nexploration and exploitation of resources (such as water, hydrocarbons and minerals), civil \nengineering, hazard assessment, research, education, or just satisfying curiosity. Each \nbusiness model, and each project within it, has its own implicit or explicit profile, identifying \nwhich geological aspects and properties are of salient importance in achieving the objectives. \nProfiles of this kind can guide the surveying process, and can also help to evaluate the \nrelevance of the results for other applications. For example, superficial deposits might be \nknown from business models to be of interest to a civil engineering study, but not to an oil \nexploration study. The profiles can be recorded as part of the provenance of information, \nadding value by deepening the users\u2019 understanding of the results. The business model does \nnot necessarily involve economic considerations, although its concern with objectives \nsuggests an interest in a shared metric of utility (such as money). It may include procedures \nfor acquiring and allocating resources in order to develop and deliver the desired products, \nand may involve cost recovery and perhaps profit.  \nA primary objective of the business model of a geological survey organization is likely to be \nthe development, recording and communication of an authoritative, coherent account of the \ngeology of a region. The objective is generally achieved by reviewing what is already known; \nsystematically observing and measuring salient geoscience properties in the field; analyzing \nand interpreting the results in the context of the rock types they characterize; and evaluating, \nintegrating, summarizing, and communicating the findings. The business model therefore \ninteracts with the cyberinfrastructure model, as well as the interlinked knowledge described in \nthe framework model, and the methods implied by the surveying model. The emphasis is \ngenerally on supplying basic geological information, rooted in an understanding of the nature, \ndistribution, history and configuration of the rock types, to support a wide range of \ncommercial, regulatory and research activities. The business model therefore seeks to provide \ninformation of wide relevance, providing a quality-assessed core of geological knowledge on \nwhich many internal and external applications can build, and to which they can relate their \nresults. The objectives will remain, but the means of achieving them will surely change. \nCurrent business models will require review in the light of Grid developments. The value of \ninformation to users can be maintained only by keeping pace with the evolving \ncyberinfrastructure and providing appropriate, high-quality information. Its usefulness \ndepends on its accuracy (implying quality assessment), relevance to the actual and potential \nrequirements (implying accurate classification and linkage), and the ease with which it can be \naccessed, used and understood (implying standards, appropriate technology and \ninteroperability). Even within a survey, there is a hierarchy of business models at various \nlevels of detail, including the objectives hidden in the tacit knowledge of individuals and in \nimplicit project objectives, which must be reconciled with the overall geological survey \nbusiness model. The shared business model adds greatly to the practical value of the final \nproducts. The information is evaluated to assess its suitability for the permanent record, in \nsurvey organizations by internal quality assessment and in external publications by editorial \njudgment assisted by reviewers. Citations in the literature reflect subsequent evaluation by \nusers, which includes further verification by testing against the real world.  \nMany survey organizations have an important secondary role in storing and disseminating \ninformation from external sources, such as civil-engineering borehole descriptions or results \nof academic studies, collected according to different business models. The increasing \nflexibility and diversity of a survey\u2019s hypermedia information store will lead to closer \ninteraction with a wider range of users. This process is supported in some disciplines by on-\n Loudon, T.V., 2009. Four interacting aspects of a geological survey knowledge system               4\nline systems designed for user collaboration, such as OpenWetWare5 and Open Notebook \nScience6. It can therefore be appropriate for a survey organization to maintain a collaborative \ninformation system that includes comments, and external contributions that retain their own \nbusiness models. Value can be added to external contributions by extending their relevance \nthrough links with the core information and sharing standards where appropriate. Geological \nsurvey organizations can make a vital contribution by formalizing a framework model and \nproviding its core content. A comprehensive framework should be able to connect items of \ninformation at all levels of detail from many sources, indicate their provenance, and help \nusers to reconcile the information with their own needs.  \n \n4. A framework model \nThe geological framework model attempts to depict and clarify the principal relationships \namong the findings of geology, and their links with applications and with other aspects of \nscience. It is potentially a specialized component of the geoscience cyber-environment in the \ninfrastructure model (Fig. 1), but, as it is primarily the concern of the geological community, \nit is considered separately in this paper. Frameworks are intended to foster the collaborative \nnature of science, encouraging individuals and organizations to work together in building \nknowledge for their mutual benefit. The existing framework for the practice of geology, \nembedded in the conventions of geological procedures and documentation, is largely taken for \ngranted. Its successor requires explicit consideration to make it accessible to software, with a \nview to simplifying the users\u2019 access to the geological knowledge stored in the infrastructure.  \nSearching for appropriate information in the diverse distributed stores representing aspects of \nglobal knowledge is a daunting task. Many users, including those unaware of the relevance of \ngeology to their requirement, may initially use a standard search engine to search for \ncombinations of pertinent words. It is helpful if surveys provide Web pages that enable search \nengines to lead users to the appropriate specialized framework required for more detailed \nsearch, such as the geological framework model.  \nThe aim of the framework model is to provide a map of the contents of geological knowledge, \nin order to identify regions that match, or are close to, the user\u2019s requirements, which can then \nbe linked to relevant information. Unlike a geographical map, the map of the geological \nframework has many dimensions. As a starting point for discussion, Loudon and Laxton \n(2007) suggested basing the contents map on a solid Earth systems model (a model of its \nsystems, in the sense of sets of interacting parts operating as a whole and organized to \nperform a specific function). The model refers to the three-dimensional disposition and \nconfiguration of the present-day objects of geoscience (the location and arrangement of the \nthings of geological interest), to their observed and interpreted properties and composition, \nand also to their history throughout geological time, including the processes that created and \naltered them and are critical to the interpretation. In other words, it refers at all levels of detail \nto what is there, what it is called, where it is, how it is arranged, what its properties are, what \nit is made of, where it came from, how it got there, and how we know.  \nThe solid Earth systems model links to a second part of the framework, namely relevant \nontologies, described by Raskin (2006) as \u201cformal representations of concepts and their \nmutual relationships in a form that captures domain knowledge\u201d. Standard generic ontologies \ncould help to relate geological information to information in related fields. A third essential \npart of the framework is a set of indexes, which relate regions in the model, along with terms \nin the ontologies, to information (including conventional representations) held in distributed \ninformation stores. Each set of information would ideally include metadata describing its \n                                                          \n5 OpenWetWare http:\/\/openwetware.org \n6 Open Notebook Science http:\/\/drexel-coas-elearning.blogspot.com\/2006\/09\/open-notebook-\nscience.html \n \n Loudon, T.V., 2009. Four interacting aspects of a geological survey knowledge system               5\nprovenance (including its business model) and constraints on its analysis, in a machine-\nreadable form where appropriate. The framework of solid Earth systems model, ontologies \nand indexes could, on the one hand, help surveyors to organize their information, record the \ncourse of their investigations, structure scientific workflows to generate products for users, \nand establish links to broader aspects of Earth systems science. On the other hand, the \nframework could help users to locate and display relevant information, evaluate its content, \nreconcile the fragments and facets of knowledge, and track threads of reasoning. It could also \nidentify where ontologies (specifying how aspects of the model are described) can be shared \nwith other disciplines, thus promoting the interoperability that enables diverse analytical \nmodels to work together. It is therefore central to the geological survey knowledge system \n(Fig. 1).  \n \n5. Surveying methods model \nThe surveying methods model describes the procedures by which information is gathered for \nadding to or amending the solid Earth systems model, and is a specific responsibility of the \nsurveyors. Surveyors, in the same way as any other user, must start by acquiring relevant \ninformation. This can then be tested against observations of the real solid Earth, and amended \nand extended by new observations or interpretations, which in due course can take their place \nin the geoscience knowledge recorded in the infrastructure. Only fragments of the solid Earth \nsystems model can be constructed from observation and analysis. The task of surveyors is to \nselect and survey such fragments guided by background knowledge, interpret their \nsignificance, and assemble the interpretations as a coherent whole. The cyberinfrastructure \nenables the surveyors to record explicit connected pathways between conclusions, \nobservations, and the process of reasoning and interpretation at all levels of detail. Compared \nwith conventional methods, these can provide a more transparent and rigorous statement of \nscientific evidence, can reduce ambiguities across disciplines and application areas, and make \nresults accessible to a wider range of users. The potential consequences include major change \nin methods of surveying. \nThe methods are changing as electronic support in the field and office develops, and the costs \nof storing, processing and communicating information plummet (Brodaric and Gahegan, \n2006). The more powerful infrastructure makes it feasible to introduce new concepts into \ngeological surveying. Also, search engines make scientists more aware of methods used in \nother fields and the prospect of more widely coordinated methods. The methods, which \nsupport and enhance each other, could enable survey organizations to build a more rigorous \nand effective record of regional geology, anchor it more firmly in its multi-disciplinary \nsetting, and provide an improved response to their business model. \nProposed methods include those based on concepts such as: three-dimensional spatial models \nof geological objects; object-oriented views of instances, classes and inheritance; scale-space \nto identify the ranges of resolution at which observations were made, objects exist and \nprocesses operate; zero-crossings for reproducible selection of object boundaries; Gaussian \nfilters for more natural continuous scale change; emergent processes for more convincing \ninterpretations; hypermedia integration of spatial, narrative and tabular information at all \nscales or granularities; representation and indexing of narrative threads of evidence, \ndescription, reasoning and interpretation; links to remotely sensed images that provide or \nclarify evidence (such as landforms, outcrops); workflow-based recording of observations, \nand the methods and reasoning that link them to the interpretation; process-based \ninterpolation methods and deformable inhomogeneous spatial models for space-filling by \njustifiable and reproducible procedures; records of shape statistics of objects, suited to \nregional comparisons as they are unaffected by moving about in three dimensions and (within \nlimits) in scale-space; visualization that separately superimposes knowledge of existence and \nshape on likely position; and Bayesian statistics to track opinions and evaluations of accuracy.  \n Loudon, T.V., 2009. Four interacting aspects of a geological survey knowledge system               6\nThe infrastructure must accommodate legacy information and identify its limitations. But it \nalso offers an opportunity for local experts to rework earlier surveys to take newer approaches \ninto account in order to refurbish the legacy information, add to its value in future information \nsystems, and develop techniques that could lead to more comprehensive digital field support. \n \n6. The knowledge system  \nThe diagram (Fig. 1) shows how the four models just discussed might work together within a \ngeological survey knowledge system. The flow of information is shown by arrows. Users \nsubmit requirements to the system and receive results by means of an agent (a piece of \nsoftware that acts with a degree of autonomy to accomplish tasks on behalf of its user). \nThrough dialog with the user, the agent can clarify the user requirements as a profile of \ninterests, defined in terms of relevant regions of the geological framework model. The user\u2019s \nbusiness model could also help the agent to establish the user\u2019s profile of interests, and \ntherefore which sources of information and which properties are of most interest. The agent \nmight also identify relevant material by comparing the user\u2019s profile with the provenance \nmetadata of information sources. The profiles identify the relative importance of properties \nrepresented in the framework model, which in turn can be related through indexes to \nappropriate information.  \nAt the simplest level, the user profile could be matched with reusable items (represented as \nhierarchies of objects), which can represent survey results at any level of detail, from an \noutcrop observation to a completed map or a regional summary. The framework might also \nlocate reusable pathways, represented by scientific workflows (Lud\u00e4scher et al., 2006), \ndescribing a sequence of procedures that can be applied over a long period to ever-changing \ninformation stores and software sources. For example, the user might wish to select, retrieve, \nassess, analyze and visualize the most up-to-date geotechnical and associated information for \na specified area using the latest display techniques, simply by invoking an existing workflow. \nThe framework can also make it possible to track and compare hypertext threads of reasoning, \nwhich might, for example, link a geological interpretation to many sources of supporting \ninformation. Based on the profile originating from their business model, surveyors could also \nacquire relevant existing information, and call up appropriate techniques from the surveying \nmethods model to interface with the solid Earth. Within the framework, the solid Earth \nsystems model could help to organize their investigation and the records of their results.  \nThe organization of geological information is changing. Conventional geological maps \nrepresent interpretations of salient aspects of the geology. They enable users to visualize and \nrecognize patterns on the map and relate them to geological explanations. The maps locate \nobservations and interpretations on the ground, where they can be tested against the real \nworld. Digital cartography, geographic information systems and computer visualization \nprovide greater flexibility \u2013 compare different aspects of the geology, pan around to compare \ndifferent areas, zoom in and out to compare features at different scales, and apply geometric \ntransformations to remove extraneous effects, such as removing the results of faulting and \nfolding before studying facies variation. The computer implementations, however, are \nessentially reductionist methods. They break down the information content into its basic \nobjects, representing observations and items depicted on the map, which can then be \nreassembled in various ways. But isolated objects have little meaning. Geologists make sense \nof their observations by integrating them with through reasoning and interpretation, leading to \ntestable conclusions. In response to a similar situation, disciplines such as ecology, biology, \nand medical science7 place increasing emphasis on systems \u2013 less emphasis on objects in their \nown right, more emphasis on the network of connections between objects. The solid Earth \nsystems model also emphasizes the systems view. In the evolving infrastructure, geologists \n                                                          \n7 European Science Foundation, September 2007.

Four interacting aspects of a geological survey knowledge system               7\nwill have an opportunity to represent, record, and communicate the interactions and \nrelationships of information items, and develop their holistic, historical narratives of evolving \nconfigurations of geological objects in the context of the environments and geological \nprocesses that shaped and changed them. A shared overview of the solid Earth system, seen as \npart of the framework, could avoid needless repetition and encourage interoperability.  \n \n7. Conclusions \nTheoretical proposals, such as this one, are an inexpensive means of exploring the design and \npotential of a future knowledge system. In practical terms, however, geological organizations \ngenerally aim to remain in the mainstream of infrastructure developments, and ensure that \ntheir resources of knowledge, information and procedures are routinely updated in step with \nthe technology (Howard et al., this volume). Geologists have readily adopted procedures that \nare analogous to conventional methods, including word processing, digital cartography, \nillustrated presentations, databases, statistical analysis, bibliographical searches, electronic \nmail, handling and editing digital manuscripts, geographic information systems and \nvisualization, and the World Wide Web. Mainstream solutions are widely used for \ndiscovering relevant material with search engines, delivering digital products for desktop \nediting and printing, and transferring micro-payments. Such methods, however, are peripheral \nto the underlying science, and do not address the full potential of the cyberinfrastructure and \nits impact on geological survey organizations. \nExisting technical solutions, as the following examples illustrate, are not fully integrated. \nProcedures to deliver-and-print at the user\u2019s desk cannot handle the size and precision of \nexisting cartographic products, which require specialized printing equipment of limited \navailability. Several infrastructure models have features relevant to geoscience investigation, \nsuch as the visualization and interaction facilities of the \u2018massively multiplayer online role-\nplaying game\u2019, but are incompatible with commonly used geological methods. During a long \nperiod of transition, the huge legacy of information dependent on conventional \nrepresentations and procedures will exist in a different setting from that of the developing \ngeological cyber-environment, and yet they must operate side by side. Only robust and well-\nsupported systems will be able to cope with the diversity and the need to migrate as the \nsolutions evolve. \nIt has been argued in this paper that various approaches might help geological survey \norganizations to benefit more fully from a Grid-based approach. These include: organizing \ninformation and ideas in modular form within a framework of models for solid Earth systems; \ndeveloping and evaluating new surveying techniques; and reassessing earlier concepts in the \nlight of such developments. Some established standards for geological classification and \nnomenclature may be inappropriate to a Grid-based knowledge system \u2013 for example, some \nstratigraphical classifications are tied more strongly to map representation than to scientific \nexplanation. Nevertheless, the developing cyberinfrastructure should in due course lead to a \nclear, integrated, mainstream solution with wide user acceptance. It would service a \ngeoscience knowledge system, meet users\u2019 requirements for linked handling of spatial, \nnarrative and tabular information in the field or office, and fulfill the users\u2019 need for evaluated \ninformation and the suppliers\u2019 need to protect their reputation and intellectual property. The \ncreation and implementation of new business, framework and surveying methods models is \nlikely to take longer than the corresponding infrastructure developments, implying that pilot \nstudies of new approaches are timely. Interacting aspects of the geological survey knowledge \nsystem, such as those discussed in this paper, rely on different areas of expertise. Geologists \nwill be involved in extensive collaboration, investigation and experiment, as they climb the \nsteep learning curve to advance with the cyberinfrastructure and meet fast-changing demands. \n \n \n Loudon, T.V., 2009.
