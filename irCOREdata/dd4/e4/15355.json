Philadelphia: Penn State University Press. \nWarf, B. 2008. Time-Space Compression: Historical Geographies. London: Routledge. \n \nAcceleration is in some ways old news. People have been bemoaning it and praising it in \nequal measure for at least two centuries. The essence of the debates remains the role of \nspeed in society. Their relative speed has been identified as one of the characteristic \nfeatures of societies. Speed is the metric of circulation, be that measured through the \nmovement of ideas, information, money or materials. Such circulation has two dimensions \u2013  \nfirst, looking at the speed of traversing the earth, i.e. speed crossing space, and, second, the \nspeed of processing and consumption, i.e. speed intensifying time. In the former the issue is \nthe extension of our spatial horizons, in the latter it is the foreshortening of our temporal \nones. One might then characterise places and eras, and many casually and habitually do, \nwith regard to either of these dimensions. The two dimensions have also been classically \ncombined in characterising the pressures for and effects of urbanisation. Urban settlements \ncan be seen as machines for intensifying time use. Thus by creating a dense set of possible \ninteractions in a small space the city uses space to accelerate time. As we move into an era \ncharacterised by more than half the world living in cities this process may then be seen as \n2 \n \nbecoming generally pervasive. Thus for instance, one might look at the lovely world map \nproduced in Williams (2009 ) of how long surface transport would take to get to the nearest \ncity of 50,000 or more people by combining information on terrain and road, rail and river \nnetworks. This isochrone map suggests that less than 10 per cent of the world\u2019s land is more \nthan 48 hours of ground-based travel from the nearest reasonable sized city. Even in \nAmazonia the extensive river networks and an increasing number of roads mean that only \n20 per cent of the land is more than two days from a city \u2013 which is roughly the same as for \nQuebec.  \nThis continues a line of studies linking distance, travel and the textures of everyday mobility \nthat have become the hallmark of time-geography. It is revealing that some of the early \nclassics of connecting time to geography speak to analysing the acceleration created by \ntransport technologies. As Allen and Hamnett put it there has been a time-space \ncompression comprising the \u2018reordering of distance, the overcoming of spatial barriers, the \nshortening of time horizons, and the ability to link distant populations in a more immediate \nand intense manner\u2019 (cited in Warf, page 8). In the inverse move to looking at intensification \nof time in place, we have studies of speed extending action across space. So early historical \ngeographies looked time taken to cover distances between places like Lansing and Detroit in \nMichigan which were 1300 minutes apart by stagecoach in 1840, but the train had reduced \nthat to 180 minutes by the 1870s and in the twentieth century the automobile reduced that \nto 80 minutes (Warf, page 15), or using isochrones maps \u2013 that is measuring distance \ntravelled in a given time - in studies of expanding commuting such as Schjerning\u2019s 1903 \nanalysis of Berlin (op. cit. p119-22) compared to more recent reconstructions of train speed \nisochrones for the nineteenth century in Britain (page 93) or the USA Eastern seabord (page \n3 \n \n99). Warf\u2019s book provides a rich history of the long run of time-space compression. In \nessence the book provides an epochal history divided into what it calls early, late and \npostmodern timespace. A society creates and inhabits forms of time and space that are both \ncharacteristic of it, and shape its characteristics. It is a story of shifting social, spatial and \ntemporal relations written on a broad scale that uses timespace compression as a lens on \nsocial orders and transformations, depicting not only people\u2019s interactions across the \nearth\u2019s surface but also examining how they reveal their understandings of their world. In \nthis there is little new in itself, rather Warf\u2019s account provides an effective synthesis of a \ngreat deal of scholarship. It focuses on the big picture of the effects of different forms of \ncommunication and technology, linking them to changing political economies. In one sense \nthen the book avoids both the fine grained analysis of numerous technologies as used in \ndaily life which might complicate and challenge a variety of accounts. It professes a studied \nambivalence regarding the exact relationship of political economy, technologies and \ntimespace\u2013 in order to eschew a technologically determined account. If anything the \npolitical economic ordering is seen as driving and requiring shifts which leads to a \ncharacterisation of the epochs of timespace into broadly an early modern stretching from \nearly colonialism to high empire, a modern period which coincides with a Fordist regime of \ncapital and postmodern period of fragmented production, deepening financialised \nglobalisation and fragmented timespaces.  \nHassan\u2019s book rather more clearly foregrounds these different senses of constellations of \npolitics, economics, technologies and timespace. Hassan provides a sound review of the \nnumerous competing characterisations that have appeared \u2013 for instance characterising the \npresent as timeless time (Castells), the society of transmission (Virilo), the videosphere \n4 \n \n(Debray) and more. Hassan, as the title of \u2018Empire\u2019 hints, is challenging the contemporary \nframing of globalisation with the invocation of Hardt and Negri\u2019s analysis. He presents a \nresolutely politicised analysis of the current total world of speed. The eventual framing of \nepochs echoes that of Warf, especially in the present era which is once again presented as \nsomehow exceptional or novel. This does I suppose beg the question as to why the present \nis so often seen as exceptional in social analysis. Hassan though sees not only oppositions of \npresent to past era but as much an emergence at a higher level. While clearly seeing the \nlineaments of power and control persisting, in ways that might be downplayed in liberal \naccounts, for Hassan the present era is characterised by the radical intensification of speed \nto become the organising principle of the contemporary era.  \nEmpire of speed places the nature of time at the centre of its account \u2013 looking at the \nramifications and transformations from clock time, but most especially the dislocation of \neconomic, social and political temporalities. Here he moves beyond Warf\u2019s account in two \nways. First, he shifts the emphasis from extension of processes over space to the \nintensification of process in place. Thus where Warf uses accelerating transport to open his \naccount, Hassan chooses the way it took Chrysler fifty-four months and 3,100 people to \ndevelop and launch its K-car in the late 70s, while the Neon in the late-80s took less than \nthirty-three months with a workforce of 700, and by 2000 a new model was taking less than \ntwenty-four months to design and launch (page 21). When space is discussed then it is \nabout ensuring the accelerated circulation of commodities (page 60). Second, as can be \nseen from that example he looks at accelerations. That is the rate of increase in speed \u2013 not \njust the speed of a society but how fast that velocity is increasing and how our society \ndevelops \u2018a fetish for open-ended speed in culture and society\u2019 (page 23). Speed at a \n5 \n \ncultural level is seen as he terms it, in a metaphor mixing up his pharmacology with his \nMarxism, an opiate or an addiction. It is thus very much more ambivalently positioned than \nfor Warf, as here it assumes the force of something now driving us to run ever faster to \nstand still, and that never delivers its promised fulfilments. He echoes the sentiments of \nsomeone like Eriksen (2001) with his scepticism as the value of speed and its costs for \nhuman experience, but Hassan extends that analysis with a sophisticated analysis of political \neconomy. \nHassan dissects the types of time created by, facilitating and compelling acceleration. In part \nhis story is about the transition from clock time to network time, but it is richer than that. \nOne might wish that the discussion of the actual practices of clock time could have been \nenlarged \u2013 since that might offer some challenges to the speedy modernity outlined, and \nimplicitly then to the hypermodern age following (for an account of the diversity of \ntemporal practices associated with the rise of the clock see Glennie and Thrift 2009). But he \nasks us to think through the hegemonic timescapes and constellations of temporalities and \ntechnologies, with dominant and subsidiary temporalities. The dominant time of modernity \nis the accelerating Fordist production process, that of the second empire of speed is the \nnetwork that produces a new enclosure, that eliminates the horizon in favour of a disparate \nfragmentary present and installs the ubiquitous always connected time of the network that \ndisconnects us from local temporalities. Looking across to Warf\u2019s volume, its focus on \ndifferential accessibility to different places stands as something of a corrective to the \nassumed \u2018ubiquity\u2019 here; though Warf too at the end emphasises the reach and uniformity \nof digital communications technologies. Hassan then moves on to looks at the pathologies \nresulting from this ever quickening quest for speed. The discussion here provides a good \n6 \n \nfocus on historiographies of anxiety  and \u2018abbreviated thinking\u2019 \u2013 which chimes again with \nEriksen\u2019s argument - but perhaps misses the historiographies of infatuations with speed so \nably, if perhaps too acceptingly, depicted by Tomlinson (2007). Tomlinson\u2019s volume also \nlocates two different cultures of speed not necessarily as epochs but rather as two sides of \nthe same coin \u2013 controlled speed and destructive speed. The continuing interrelationship of \nthose rather than their successions might offer something more here to the story. \nWhat is presented in Empire of speed is clearly a temporalised political economy \u2013 and one \nthat provocatively raises questions of the relations of economic, technological and temporal \nformation. Hassan knowingly engages with technological accounts and their determinist \nhistories \u2013 arguing that to deny the efficacy of technologies entirely is surely wrong, while in \nthe end for his account it is political economy that really drives the relationships. Specific \neconomic formations may depend upon technical configurations, but the underlying logic of \nspeed is found in the political economy. And formal politics is written strongly into that \naccount, with the conclusion really being about the failure of liberal democracy to cope with \nthe accelerated worlds. Here Hassan tells effectively a story of the death of reflection in \ngovernance in the face of speed \u2013 or rather the growing deficit in the capacity to reflect and \ncontrol. Here we see a slightly different sense of epochs where the social and economic \nplanning of the fordist period appears as a temporary stabilisation in the otherwise \nsmoothly accelerating arc of speed. Perhaps oddly given the book\u2019s title, what we see little \nof are the preceding temporalities of classically Imperial governance. One might make the \ncase that the North American revolution was down to inadequate speeds of governance \nconnecting London and its accelerating colonies, and there is a great deal to say on \nassumptions of linear fast time being located in imperial metropoles and cyclical traditional \n7 \n \ntime in the colonies (famously in works from Hegel, Mill and Marx on India, through to the \neducational governance of Macaulay), and then the actual practices of temporalised \ngovernance and chronological narration that served to create colonies (Kalpagam 1999). \nAnd for colonised, and colonising, cities there is a long history of the \u2018intertwining of times, \nof attitudes, of the coming together and moving apart of past and present, [that] has \nhistorically created [an] urban kaleidoscope. ... where many times coexist simultaneously.... \ncompressed, layered, juxtaposed in this ... schizophrenic space and time capsule\u2019 (Mehrotra \n1999 pages 64, 67). \nRosa and Scheuerman\u2019s excellent collection picks up the political theme with a strong focus \non speed and governance, indeed it concludes with essays on explicitly political process, \nreprinting Connolly on circulation, Virilio\u2019s state of emergency and a reflection on \naccelerated modes of citizenship by Scheuerman. It is good to see political process as well as \neconomic and social change so explicitly addressed. It also works very hard to historicise the \nclaims for speed, with a section devoted to classic statements from the nineteenth and \ntwentieth centuries which serve to show the long history of social anxiety about speed. The \ncontinued relevance of, say, Schmitt\u2019s critique on speed as rationale for executive action, \nand the positioning of legislatures as blockages out of step is remarkable. It also begs the \nquestion of what can we say is really different now? And if we examine the examples we \nalso find more complex temporal patterning than just acceleration. Thus the legislature may \nbe a too slow process, it may find legislation born out of time, but equally in the case of \nBritain the executive enabling acts Schmitt was criticising (those that outline a principle but \nleave the rules to the executive, and indeed let the executive amend the legislation to fit \nlater needs) are founded upon 500 year old precedents known as Henry VIIIth clauses. It is a \n8 \n \nsign of how this volume picks up on some of these counter-currents that the chapter by Urry \ncontrasts the growth of \u2018capital\u2019s freedom from time and culture\u2019s escape from the clock\u2019 \nboth being shaped decisively by information systems (page 189) with campaigns for a \n\u2018glacial time\u2019 in movements such as Cittaslow or Commonground where he points to the \nrevalorisation of things like patina, as accumulated value and the rising popularity of \nconservation movements. It might be argued these are simply different responses to a \nsimilar analysis of social trends \u2013 they too see acceleration as a danger, but one they believe \namenable to social action (see for instance the account by Parkins and Craig 2005). These \nmovements and the chapter do not question whether acceleration exists but whether it can \nbe held or what its limits might be. If anything such struggles might be seen as confirming a \npopular belief in (deleterious) acceleration. Perhaps more striking is the critique offered by \nStephen Breuer elegantly summarising Virilio\u2019s theory of dromocratic revolution then taking \non its reductivist central assumptions. This essay is important since while most people \neschew the extremes to which Virilio goes, the drift of his argument is often left \nunchallenged. \nThe core of the volume as one might expect is really an elaboration and debate over Rosa\u2019s \nelegantly put thesis, developed from the work of Hermann L\u00fcbbe (who provides a summary \nin this volume) that acceleration can be demonstrated in the contraction of the meaningful \npresent (Gegenwartsschrumpfung)\u2013 usefully defined as the period for which a stock of \nknowledge (or things, though that is less clear here) remain useful. This remains one of the \nmost original and effective moves in the literature on acceleration that gets us beyond \nattempts to infer speed from social anxiety. The question which emerges from the chapters \nhere on economic organisation is to what extent is acceleration an accurate \n9 \n \ncharacterisation? The examples provided show increasing institutional instability resulting \nfrom fragmentation. The desynchronisation of different parts of social, political and \neconomic life and even different parts within each of those realms, is convincingly \narticulated. Acceleration we might say must though involve a general direction of travel \nrather than just ever more frenetic but aleatory instabilities.  \nAnd so, the grand narrative of acceleration seems rather too sweeping, too uniform at \ntimes. For sure, there is a dialectical sense that if there is one thing worse than being subject \nto acceleration, it is not being subject to it. But the sense Hassan offers of back eddies and \ndifferent temporalities, that Urry finds, that Warf shows in differential compression only \never appears sotto voce. Indeed when counter-currents appear they are positioned as \nopposing, more or less successfully, the trend of hegemonic political economic organisation. \nBut what of slowness produced by the world system? Many borders have been rendered \nless permeable to movement for the majority of people, as fast as electronic bits have \novercome one kind of borders then others have reappeared. Nor is it all about the future. \nIncreasingly digital media are being used to popularise and reanimate archives, the last half \ncentury has seen a massive revalorisation of traditional built forms, and increasingly value \nresides in slower production and indeed an economy of presence now equates privilege \nwith personal contact. These books make powerful, if depressing, reading. They offer an \nimpressive sweep and analysis of contemporary social change and the temporal \ntransformations ensuing. The danger is that in depicting a dromocentric society they offer a \ndromocentric story and other temporalities get downplayed. Is that justifiable? It can be \nargued so. Is it just wishful thinking wanting alternative temporalities to be given more \n10 \n \nroom? Well, for sure, they do not appear likely to challenge the hegemonic time regime. But \nequally we should not overestimate the reach of that hegemony. \n \nCorrespondence address: \nMike Crang, Department of geography, Durham University, South rd., Durham. DH1 3LE.
