DOI: 10.1371\/journal.ppat.0020027\nIntroduction\nBlood-feeding parasites act as vectors of an enormous\nrange of pathogens that cause diseases in humans and other\nanimals. For example, a single tick species (Ixodes ricinus) can\ntransmit viruses, bacteria, and protozoa that cause tick-borne\nencephalitis, Lyme disease, and babesiosis. Protection by\nimmunization requires several different antipathogen vac-\ncines, while vector control generally relies on the use of\nrepellents, or on large-scale, repeated applications of\npesticides that raise issues concerning pesticide resistance,\nfood residues, health risks, and environmental pollution. New\nstrategies are required to control both the vectors and\npathogens they transmit.\nA novel approach is antivector vaccines designed to target\nthe vector in such a way that they protect against pathogens\ntransmitted by the vector. Several observations suggest this\nmay be feasible. Reduced transmission capacity of ticks fed on\ntick-immune animals [1\u20135] and humans [6] has been reported\nfor several tick-borne pathogens, although not all [7]. For\nexample, people who express an immune reaction against the\nvector tick Ixodes scapularis appear to acquire Lyme disease\nless frequently than those who experience no such immune\nresponse [6]. For insect vectors, bites of uninfected sand flies\nprovide protection of mice against cutaneous leishmaniasis\n[8], and seroconversion of humans against sandfly vectors\ncorrelates with development of protective immunity to\nleishmaniasis [9]. Experimentally, it has been shown that\nantibodies raised against mosquito midgut lysates lowered\nvector competence, reducing transmission of human malarial\nparasites [10], while antibodies to a sandfly midgut galectin\neliminated sandfly transmissible infections of leishmania [11]\nin membrane feeding studies.\nArthropod vectors induce immunosuppression in the host\nduring feeding and secrete pathogen transmission-enhancing\nfactors that counteract host rejection responses [12\u201315]. For\nexample, the Lyme disease agent Borrelia burgdorferi appears to\nexploit tick salivary proteins (BIP and Salp15 from I. ricinus and\nI. scapularis, respectively) to facilitate transmission to the\nmammalian host [16,17]. Therefore research on antivector\nimmunity needs to be refined to distinguish antigens that\ninduce protective immune responses whilst preventing patho-\ngen transmission.

Immunity against the sand\nfly salivary antigen modified the dermal site of infection,\nlimiting leishmania parasite replication although not appar-\nently blocking transmission. Recombinant forms of a 15-kDa\ntick saliva protein (64TRPs) of Rhipicephalus appendiculatus\nlikewise induce potent humoral and delayed type hyper-\nsensitivity responses [19]. In hamster, guinea pig, and rabbit\nmodels, this cement antigen acts as a dual-action vaccine by\ntargeting the tick-feeding site (impairing attachment and\nfeeding) and cross-reacting with \u2018\u2018concealed\u2019\u2019 midgut antigens,\nresulting in death of engorged ticks [19,20]. The protein is\nderived from the cement cone that secures the tick\u2019s mouth-\nparts in the host skin and, as a broad-spectrum vaccine antigen,\nis effective against adult and immature stages of several tick\nspecies, including I. ricinus [20]. In this study, we tested the\npotential of the 64TRP anti-tick vaccine to protect mice\nagainst a lethal infection of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV)\ntransmitted by its natural vector, I. ricinus. In humans, TBEV is\nthe most important vector-borne virus infection in Europe\nand northern Asia [21]. Both transmission-blocking and\nprotective activities were demonstrated by the 64TRP vaccine.\nComparison of the results with those obtained whenmice were\nimmunized with either the commercial TBEV vaccine or the\ncommercial anti-tick vaccine (TickGARD), together with\nhistological and immunocytological studies, indicate that the\nkey mode of action of 64TRP immunisation is the local\ncutaneous delayed type hypersensitivity response (possibly a\nCD8\u00fe phenotype) evoked at the skin site of tick feeding.\nResults\nEffect of Immunizations on TBEV Transmission and Disease\nEvaluation of the transmission-blocking and protective\neffects of immunization with either 64TRP tick cement\nantigens, TBEV virus, or TickGARD was based on comparing\nthree parameters against controls: (1) \u2018\u2018transmission\u2019\u2019\u2014virus\ntransmission measured by the number of uninfected nymphal\nticks that became infected when cofeeding with a single\ninfected adult female; (2) \u2018\u2018support\u2019\u2019\u2014number of mice\nsupporting transmission from infected to uninfected ticks\n(this involves virus replication in mouse tissues) [22]; and (3)\n\u2018\u2018survival\u2019\u2019\u2014number of mice that survived exposure to\ninfected ticks (Figure 1).

Controlling so many diseases is an enormous\nchallenge. A new idea is to make vaccines against the vectors\nrather than against all the individual disease agents they carry. The\nauthors examined this hypothesis using a vaccine prepared from\ntick cement. This cement is secreted by ticks to help them attach to\na human or animal to feed. A mouse model was used in which mice\nwere infested with ticks infected with tick-borne encephalitis virus\n(TBEV), the most important vector-borne virus in Europe and\nnorthern Asia. The control mice developed fatal encephalitis and\ndied about a week after being bitten by the infected tick. By\ncontrast, the tick cement vaccine gave protection similar to the level\nseen in mice immunized with a single shot of the commercial TBEV\nvaccine for humans. However, a commercial tick vaccine used to\ncontrol cattle ticks did not protect the mice. The authors\u2019 tick\ncement vaccine appeared to work by causing a cellular immune\nresponse in the skin where ticks were feeding. These results show\nthat it is feasible to produce a vaccine against a tick that protects\nagainst the disease agent it transmits.\ndose of TBEV. Animals that did not survive i.p. inoculation\nand did not yield infected ticks were excluded from the\nanalyses (see Materials and Methods, \u2018\u2018Data analysis\u2019\u2019). Overall\nthere was a correlation between \u2018\u2018survival\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018support,\u2019\u2019 but\nnot between \u2018\u2018survival\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018transmission\u2019\u2019: mice that\nsupported virus transmission were significantly less likely to\nsurvive (r \u00bc \u00010.557, p \u00bc 0.02), whereas there was no\ncorrespondence between the % nymphs infected and the %\nmice that survived (r \u00bc\u00010.180, p \u00bc 0.488).\nControls. All the unimmunized mice supported virus\ntransmission, with each animal yielding at least three infected\nnymphs (Table 1). Hence TBEV had been transmitted from\nthe infected female tick to the mouse on which it was feeding,\nand then transmitted from the infected mouse to uninfected\ncofeeding nymphs. Similar results were obtained with control\nmice immunized with glutathione S-transferase (GST). Most\nof the control mice died within 9\u201311 d of exposure to a\nTBEV-infected tick. There was no evidence of an anti-tick\neffect: the % nymphs fed on control animals compared with\nthe treated groups were similar. However, the experiments\nwere not designed to assess the effect of 64TRP immunization\non tick feeding and tick survival, as demonstrated previously\n[19,20]. Thus nymphal ticks were removed prior to repletion\nand drop-off (for virus detection) instead of being assessed\nfor feeding success and survival.\nEffect of 64TRP immunizations. Transmission-blocking\nactivity was observed for 64TRP-immunized mice. Signifi-\ncantly fewer animals supported virus transmission to nymphs\n(v2 \u00bc 39.2, df \u00bc 3, p \u0002 0.001) and fewer nymphs became\ninfected (v2 \u00bc 46.1, df \u00bc 1, p , 0.001) compared with the\ncontrols (Figure 1B and 1A, respectively). In addition, 64TRP\nimmunization provided protection against a fatal infection\nwith TBEV. Significantly more 64TRP-immunized mice\nsurvived compared with the controls (v2 \u00bc 225, df \u00bc 1, p ,\n0.001) (Figure 1C). The highest level of protection from a\nsingle 64TRP dose was observed with TRP6 (Table 1).\nImmunization with the 64TRP cocktails, including two\n64TRP doses (Table 2, group I), gave results that were not\nsignificantly different from the single immunogens (Table 1,\ngroup I).\nEffect of TBEV vaccine. The virus vaccine was similar to\n64TRP in reducing the level of virus transmission to\ncofeeding ticks (Figure 1A). However, whereas significantly\nfewer 64TRP-immunized mice supported virus transmission\ncompared with the controls, this was not the case for mice\nimmunized with the virus vaccine (v2\u00bc 5.83, df\u00bc 7, p\u00bc 0.735)\n(Figure 1B). The protective effect of immunization with a\nsingle dose of the 64TRP tick antigens did not differ\nsignificantly from a single dose of the TBEV vaccine (v2 \u00bc\n5.83, df \u00bc 7, p , 0.560) (Figure 1C).\nEffect of TickGARD vaccine. Immunization with the\ncommercial TickGARD vaccine (Table 2) provided trans-\nmission blocking similar to that observed following 64TRP-\nimmunization (v2 \u00bc 10.5, df \u00bc 7, p , 0.162). Compared with\nthe controls, both TickGARD and 64TRP treatments gave\nlower transmission (v2 \u00bc 32.1 df \u00bc 1, p \u00bc, 0.001), and fewer\nmice supported transmission (v2 \u00bc 27.2, df \u00bc 2, p \u00bc , 0.001)\n(Figure 1A and 1B, respectively). However, there was a\nsignificant difference in protective effect of the tick\ncement\u2013derived vaccine (64TRP) compared with the tick\nmidgut vaccine (TickGARD) (v2 \u00bc 52.2, df \u00bc 15, p , 0.001).\nUnlike 64TRP, TickGARD did not protect mice against a fatal\ninfection with TBEV (Figure 1C), even when the animals were\nimmunized with three doses of the commercial tick vaccine\n(Table 1, group L).\nCellular and Humoral Immune Responses\nA protective anti-tick immune response that blocks tick-\nborne pathogen transmission is associated with development\nof tick-specific antibodies [23,24] and cellular infiltration\n[25,26]. Therefore, we compared the responses of 64TRP-\nimmunized mice with those of controls to identify a possible\nimmunological basis for the observed transmission-blocking\nand protective effects.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay\nresults showed that antibody titers to cognate 64TRPs in\n64TRP-immunized mice increased 2- to 4-fold relative to\npreinfestation titers (from a basal level of 1:4,000 to 1:8\u2013\n16,000), whereas antibodies to GST had fallen in GST-\nimmunized mice (to ,1:1,000) after infestation.

In addition, skin\nsections from TRP2 and TRP5 immunization revealed\nperivascular cuffing, degranulating mast cells, numerous\nlymphocytes, frequent macrophages, and some eosinophils,\ndermal dendrocytes, neutrophils, and basophils (Figure 2D\nand 2E). Fewer cells and cell types were observed in the GST\ncontrol, and they were mainly lymphocytes, macrophages,\nand dermal dendrocytes (Figure 2F).\nEvaluation of CD4\u00fe and CD8\u00fe T lymphocyte responses\nrevealed a CD8\u00fe response in 64TRP-immunized mice\ncompared with GST and unimmunized animals (Figure 3).\nFor example, skin samples from the TRP5-immunized mice\nshowed a predominantly CD8\u00fe T cell response, with\nnumerous T cells occluding several dermal blood vessels\n(Figure 3C and 3D); a CD4\u00fe T cell response was also observed\nbut to a lesser degree (Figure 3D). In contrast, the primary\nresponse detected in the dermis of skin samples from control\nunimmunized mice following tick infestation was a CD4\u00fe T\ncell response (Figure 3F) with a slight CD8\u00fe effect. Control\nsamples from GST-immunized mice were negative for CD8\u00feT\ncells (Figure 3A), with a slight CD4\u00fe T cell response (Figure\n3B). The characteristic epidermal hyperplasia observed in the\nhistological profiles coincided with the site of tick attachment\n(Figure 2A, which shows the cement cone). Attachment sites\nwere not observed in sections used for immunocytochemical\nstaining, which may explain the apparent absence of an\nepidermal hyperplasia (Figure 3C and 3D).\nDiscussion\nIn the mouse model for tick-borne transmission of TBEV,\nthe virus is transmitted from an infected tick to the\nuninfected mouse on which it feeds. The virus infects and\nreplicates in the skin site of feeding, and is then transmitted\nfrom the infected mouse to uninfected ticks cofeeding on the\nanimal [23]. These transmission dynamics were observed for\nthe control unimmunized and GST-immunized mice. Of the\n39 control mice, 95% supported virus transmission giving rise\nto infected nymphs, and 51% uninfected nymphs feeding on\nthe control mice became infected. Only 15% of the mice\nsurvived demonstrating the susceptibility of Balb\/c mice to\nTBEV infection.\nBy comparison with the controls, transmission-blocking\nactivity was observed in 64TRP-immunized mice. Only 48%\nanimals supported virus transmission to nymphs and fewer\nnymphs became infected (16%) compared with the controls.\nRemarkably, an average of 46% 64TRP-immunized mice\nsurvived tick-transmitted virus infection and subsequent\nlethal challenge by virus inoculation. The highest level of\nprotection from a single 64TRP dose was observed with TRP6\n(71% survival). This construct shows the most extensive\nantigenic cross-reactivity with whole nymphal extracts,\ncement cone, and midgut of female I. ricinus [20]. 64TRP-\nimmunized mice developed antiviral protection even when\nthey did not support virus transmission to cofeeding nymphs.\nFor example, of the ten surviving TRP5-immunized mice,\neight animals did not yield infected nymphs, whereas all\nsurviving control mice produced infected nymphs. These data\nindicate that the response of 64TRP-immunized mice to tick\nfeeding did not completely block virus transmission but\ninstead allowed sufficient exposure to the virus for the mouse\nto develop protective immunity. Thus virus transmission\noccurred from the infected female tick to the mouse, but not\nfrom the mouse to uninfected cofeeding nymphs. The\nexperimental design did not allow us to distinguish immuni-\nzation that completely blocked virus transmission from\ninfected ticks to mice, leaving the mice still susceptible to\ninfection. These animals would have been excluded from the\nanalyses because they would not have survived the subsequent\ni.p. challenge with a lethal dose of TBEV.\nThe protective effect of immunization with a single dose of\nthe 64TRP tick antigens did not differ significantly from a\nsingle shot of the commercially available inactivated TBEV\nvaccine (FSME-IMMUN; Baxter, Vienna, Austria) most com-\nmonly used in Europe [21]. The virus vaccine was also similar\nto the 64TRP vaccine in reducing the number of cofeeding\nTable 2.

However, whereas signifi-\ncantly fewer 64TRP-immunized mice supported virus trans-\nmission compared with the controls, this was not the case for\nmice immunized with the virus vaccine. Thus, under the\nconditions used, the TBEV vaccine was not as effective as\n64TRP in controlling transmission from the infected tick to\nthe immunized mouse and\/or from the infected mouse to\nuninfected cofeeding ticks. The results confirm a previous\nstudy in which 89% natural rodent hosts immune to TBEV\nsupported cofeeding virus transmission [27], and indicate a\ngreater level of virus infection in virus-immune mice\ncompared with tick-immune mice. The contrasting results\nalso indicate a different mechanism of protection, which is\nconsistent with the lack of antigenic cross-reactivity between\n64TRP antigens and TBEV proteins (unpublished data). The\nTBEV vaccine is presumably controlling the infection in the\nmouse, protecting the mouse against development of a fatal\nencephalitis and reducing the number of nymphs that\nbecome infected. By contrast, 64TRP appears to affect\ntransmission from the infected tick to the mouse, and from\nthe infected mouse to uninfected cofeeding nymphs, possibly\nacting at the level of Langerhans cells, which play a role in\ntick-borne TBEV transmission and are modulated by compo-\nnent(s) in tick saliva [22,28].\nImmunization with the commercial TickGARD vaccine\nprovided transmission-blocking similar to 64TRP-immuniza-\ntion, with both significantly lower transmission rates to\nnymphs and fewer mice supporting transmission compared\nwith controls. However, unlike 64TRP-immunization, the\ntransmission-blocking effects of TickGARD did not provide\nprotection against lethal infection with TBEV. TickGARD\nand Gavac (the Cuban equivalent) are derived from Bm86, a\nmidgut antigen of unknown function [29]. These commercial\nanti-tick vaccines induce an antibody-mediated response\ntargeted at midgut cells that results in rupture of the midgut,\ntick mortality, and reduced reproductive output. They appear\nto reduce the incidence of tick-borne diseases in cattle\n(babesiosis and anaplasmosis) by depleting tick numbers [29].\nThe 64TRP antigen derived from a tick cement protein acts\nin a similar way to the Bm86 antigen: 64TRP cross-reacts with\nantigenic epitopes in the tick midgut, causing rupture to the\nmidgut resulting in mortality [19,20]. Although our exper-\nimental design did not allow evaluation of the vaccination\neffects on tick feeding\/survival, the transmission-blocking\neffects of TickGARD indicate that it affected the ability of\nnymphs to acquire the infection. This is consistent with the\nlack of correlation between the % nymphs infected and %\nsurvivors. A previous study using 64TRP-immunized rabbits\nand hamsters showed cross-protection against I. ricinus adults\nand nymphs, causing increased mortality [20]. Thus, anti-tick\nFigure 2.

These consistent responses of\n64TRP-immunized animals to tick feeding show that natural\ntick infestation stimulates anti-64TRP immunity, indicating\nthe potential of a 64TRP-based vaccine to provide long-lasting\nimmunity without the need for repeat vaccinations.\nThe humoral immune response observed is consistent with\nthe histological profile of marked epidermal hyperplasia and\ninfiltration of leukocytes following tick infestation of 64TRP-\nimmunized animals contrasting with comparatively little\ncellular response to tick feeding in GST-immunized and\nunimmunized controls. Furthermore, T and B lymphocytes,\nplasma cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells are associated\nwith acquired immunity [30]. Interestingly, the 64TRP-\nimmunized mice demonstrated a predominantly CD8\u00fe\nresponse compared with controls. Previous studies show that\ntick resistance is more effectively transferred with lymph\nnode cells than with only serum from tick-resistant animals\n[31]. They imply an important role for cell-mediated\nimmunity and the need to determine T cell phenotype. Our\nstudy is limited but the first to indicate the predominant\nphenotype of the T cell response invoked by the 64TRP tick\ncement antigen in a mouse model. A previous study reported\nCD4\u00fe cells outnumbering CD8\u00fe cells in mice repeatedly\ninfested with I. ricinus nymphs that did not develop resistance\nto tick infestation, indicating that a predominant CD4\u00fe cell\ntype does not confer tick resistance in Balb\/c mice [26]. Not\nsurprisingly, therefore, repeat tick infestation does not\ninduce full protection in laboratory mice [26]. By contrast,\nin other host species (guinea pigs, rabbits, and cattle), innate\nresistance to ticks is conserved during repeat tick infestations\n[32]. Moreover, humans repeatedly infested with I. ricinus ticks\nexpress dermal and perivascular infiltrates of CD8\u00fe T\nlymphocytes [25]. Thus the predominant CD8\u00fe profile in\nBalb\/c mice immunized with 64TRP, and comparatively\ninsignificant CD4\u00fe response, are consistent with previous\nreports implicating the CD8\u00fe phenotype in tick resistance.\nAlthough it was not specifically determined, the observed\nantivirus immunity is unlikely to be CD8 dependent. Protec-\ntion against lethal TBEV infection is not T cell mediated but\nhas been linked to antibodies against a nonstructural virus\nprotein absent from the virion [33]. Other studies in C57BL6\nmice indicate that activation of virus-specific memory B cells\nto secrete IgG is independent of cognate or bystander T cell\nhelp [34]. Induction of complement is the dominant mecha-\nnism of protection, although when this pathway is inactivated\nother mechanisms involving cytotoxic T lymphocytes and\nnatural killer cells come into play. T cells from immunized\nmice are protective only in animals whose pre-existing\nimmune function had been impaired [35].\nThe marked cellular response to tick infestation in 64TRP-\nimmunized mice, contrasting with controls, indicates that the\nimmunomodulated site of tick feeding is disrupted. This\ndisruption would also counter the activity of saliva-activated\ntransmission factors present in I. ricinus saliva that promote\nTBEV transmission [36]. The TBEV saliva-activated trans-\nmission factor(s) has not been identified but appears to be\nsecreted after the tick cement proteins; hence, it is unlikely to\nbe the same molecule [27,37]. Thus, the observed protective\neffects in 64TRP-immunized mice most likely result from\ngeneral humoral and cellular responses to tick feeding rather\nthan specific antiviral or anti\u2013saliva-activated transmission\nfactor immunity. Our results indicate that TBEV transmitted\nby infected ticks into the skin of 64TRP-immunized mice\nenters a hostile microenvironment (e.g., Figure 2A) in contrast\nto the privileged feeding site in unimmunized mice (e.g.,\nFigure 2B). According to the known dynamics of tick-borne\nTBEV infection in mice, disruption of the immunomodulated\nsite of tick feeding prevents or limits establishment of TBEV at\nthe initial skin infection site, a prerequisite of successful\ntransmission [22]. This basis for the transmission-blocking and\nprotective effects of 64TRP immunizations explains the\ncontrasting observations with the TBEV and TickGARD\nvaccines since neither of these vaccines is reported to cause\nan inflammatory response following tick bite.\nThere is now convincing evidence that blood-feeding\narthropod vectors are more than a mere syringe in trans-\nmitting vector-borne pathogens. The effect of their saliva at\nthe skin site of feeding provides conditions that facilitate\npathogen transmission and infection. Examples include\nsandflies and leishmania [38], ticks and tick-borne viruses\nand bacteria [37], mosquitoes and Cache Valley and La Crosse\nviruses [12,39], blackflies and vesicular stomatitis virus [14],\nmites and scrub typhus bacteria [40], mosquitoes and West\nNile virus [41], and possibly Aedes mosquitoes and avian\nmalaria parasites [42]. A vaccine strategy aimed at creating an\nantivector cell-mediated immune response at the skin site of\ntransmission that interferes with pathogen transmission\noffers a new approach to controlling a vast range of\nimportant vector-borne diseases.\nMaterials and Methods\nImmunizations. Experimental Balb\/c mice were arranged into\ntreatment groups of at least 10 animals per group (Table 2). The\nfollowing constructs of 64TRP, the tick cement protein, were used\neither singly or as cocktails: TRP5 (full-length soluble protein), TRP6\n(full-length denatured protein), or TRP2 (a C-terminal truncation),\nexpressed in Escherichia coli as GST-fusion proteins. The constructs\nwere as described previously [19]. Controls were mice immunized\nwith recombinant GST alone or naive animals that were not\nimmunized. The 64TRP constructs and GST control were emulsified\nin Titermaxgold adjuvant (CytRx USA, Los Angeles, California,\nUnited States). In Trial I, 80 Balb\/c mice were divided into 7\nexperimental groups and in Trial II, 62 mice were divided into five\ngroups (Table 1). Mice were immunized with only a single priming\ndose (10 lg) of the 64TRP antigen (or GST control) unless otherwise\nspecified (Table 2). All immunizations were by subcutaneous\ninoculation into the prescapular region.\nSerological assays. Individual host immune responses to 64TRP\nimmunizations were determined at wk 2 and 4, and at wk 6 after\nvaccination (i.e., pre- and postchallenge antibody titers, respectively)\nby end-point dilution enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and strip\nblot assays using methods described previously [19].\nTBEV-infected ticks. Ticks were obtained from a laboratory colony\nof uninfected I. ricinus maintained at the Institute of Virology,\nBratislava, Slovakia. TBEV donor ticks were prepared by parenteral\ninoculation of I. ricinus females with 0.002 ml\/tick TBEV (Hypr strain),\ndiluted 10\u00011. Each tick received a dose of 5,000 plaque-forming units\n(PFUs) of virus. Each animal was infested with a single infected female\ntick accompanied by a single uninfected male tick to promote female\ntick feeding. Virus titration was as previously described [22]. After\ntick feeding, salivary glands were dissected from fed adult female ticks\nand assayed for TBEV; titers ranged from 100 to .1000 PFU. Nymphs\nthat fed for 3 d (average feeding period) were tested for acquired\nTBEV; dead and unfed ticks were discarded.\nHost challenge with TBEV-infected tick. When antiserum titers to\nthe 64TRP constructs reached 1:4,000 to 1:16,000 (4 wk after\nimmunization), each mouse was challenged with a single TBEV-\ninfected female tick, cofed with one uninfected male and 15\nuninfected nymphs in a transparent retaining chamber [22]. The\nsame time interval (4 wk after immunization) was used to challenge\nthe TBEV vaccine and TickGARD (Intervet Australia Pty. Ltd.,\nPLoS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org April 2006 | Volume 2 | Issue 4 | e270257\nAntivector Vaccine Pathogen Protection\nBendigo, Australia)\u2013immunized mice. Mice that survived tick\ninfestation were observed for clinical signs of encephalitis for a\nperiod of 21 d. After this observation period, to determine whether\nsurviving mice had indeed been exposed to TBEV infection and\ndeveloped protective immunity, each surviving animal was inoculated\nintraperitoneally (i.p.) with 1,000 PFU of TBEV (Hypr strain).\nData analysis. A Chi-squared test using binomial errors was\nperformed to analyse the tick TBEV transmission efficiency data\nand analysis of variance with regression analysis to determine the\ncorrelations between mouse survival and transmission blocking\/virus\nreplication. All data from mice infested with uninfected ticks, or\nwhere ticks were not feeding or were destroyed by their host, were\nexcluded from the analyses on the assumption that TBEV trans-\nmission had not occurred. Further, mice that did not support virus\ntransmission between cofeeding ticks and did not develop protective\nimmunity (they succumbed to i.p. inoculation of TBEV) were also\nexcluded from the analyses. Although the conditions used to measure\nthe level of protection were probably far more stringent than an\ninfected tick bite, it was assumed that transmission and infection of\nthe host had not occurred in survivors that were susceptible to i.p.\nTBEV challenge.\nHistological and immunocytochemical assays. The nature of the\ncutaneous local inflammatory responses at tick feeding sites was\ndetermined by necropsy studies on skin biopsies after terminal\nanaesthesia, as previously described [19]. Wax-embedded skin\nsections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin or with Hema\n\u2018\u2018Gurr\u2019\u2019 Rapid Blood Smear reagents. Phenotypes of T cell lympho-\ncytes infiltrating the skin of 64TRP-immunized and control mice were\ncharacterized using antibodies to mouse cell-surface markers CD4\u00fe\nand CD8\u00fe by immunochemical staining using CD4\u00fe or CD8\u00fe\nantiserum (provided by Dunn School of Pathology, Oxford Univer-\nsity, Oxford, United Kingdom).\nSupporting Information\nAccession Numbers\nThe GenBank (http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/Genbank) accession num-\nber for tick cement protein is AF469170.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Mr. Mick Peacey for his assistance in tick collection and\nsorting, Liz Darley for the histology, and Mirko Slova\u00b4k for virus\ninoculation of ticks.
