The new\nprioritization of skills at government level is reflected in policy statements and strategy at\nI I\nOaire McAvinia Key skills by design: adapting a central Web resource to departmental contexts\nall levels of education and training (DfES, 2001), and indeed by the renaming of the\nDepartment for Education and Employment as the Department for Education and Skills.\nWithin higher education, key skills are represented as 'general' skills which employers\nexpect graduates to bring to the workplace in addition to the specialist knowledge they\nhave acquired in the course of their degree studies (Atkins, 1999). They are usually defined\nas being separate from discipline-specific skills and assumed to be easily 'transferable' from\none context to another. Although there is a continuing debate about the nature of these\nskills, whether they can be transferred, and whether employers are in fact able to predict\nwhat kinds of skills they will need from future graduate cohorts (Drew, 1998), the agenda\nhas been steadily advanced by HE policy in recent years.\nKey skills have been grouped under a variety of labels: 'core', 'personal transferable' and\n'generic' to name a few (Bennett, Dunne and Carre, 1999). Attempts have also been made\non a national level to draw up a definitive list of key skills. The Qualifications and\nCurriculum Authority (QCA, 2000) has undertaken this for pre-university and National\nVocational Qualifications, while Dearing (DfEE\/NCIHE, 1997) nominated four key skills\nwhich he recommended should be developed in the course of a student's higher education:\ncommunication, numeracy, information technology and learning to learn.\nThere remain many differences between the institutions' and subject disciplines' definitions\nof key skills. Institutions may define key skills in terms of 'graduateness', and the\nattributes they would like their graduates to have. For subject disciplines, the various\ncategorizations of skills may stem from the difficulties in defining which skills are subject-\nspecific and which are 'general' or transferable (Bennett, Dunne and Carre, 2000). This is\nreflected in the extensive lists of skills which have emerged from the subject benchmarking\nprocess instigated by the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA, 2001).\nHowever, although the terminology and the lists themselves are not universally agreed,\nmost will include communication, improving own learning, information technology skills,\nnumeracy, teamwork and problem-solving.\nKey skills delivery in higher education\nInstitutional approaches\nDelivering provision for key skills to students in higher education is made more difficult by\nthe fact that there is a wider debate about whether it is the role of higher education to\nprepare graduates for life after their studies and for the workplace (Drew, 1998). If we\naccept that this is a significant responsibility of the university, then to what extent should it\nbe resourced and should provision be made within the curriculum? A second issue here is\nthat of support for any initiative once it is under way: university management may be\nreluctant to invest in long-term provision, the effects of which are insufficiently\ndocumented (Hesketh, 2000), and towards which greater and lesser amounts of\ngovernment interest are directed at various times (Drew, 1998).\nAs a consequence of these debates, there is an extensive range of approaches to the\nimplementation of key skills from one university to another (Fallows and Steven, 2000).\nSome universities undertake institution-wide audits for key skills and set firm targets for\nskills delivery and assessment. Others may choose a project-based approach, whereby\nexploratory work is done with small groups of academic staff and a range of methods\n12\nALT-} Volume 10 Number I\npiloted. However, almost all of these approaches rely on centralized provision for skills\ndevelopment: this will either be in the form of centrally delivered, optional support for all\nstudents, or as self-contained generic units developed by a central team and 'bolted on' to\nindividual subject curricula.\nPractical issues for delivery\nThe combined effects of the issues discussed above impact strongly on the practical\ndelivery of key skills support to university students. Day-to-day responsibility for provision\ntends to lie with a small centrally-located team which must address the needs of all\nstudents. Sometimes this team may be part of an existing service division, in which case it\nhas the benefit of that support structure, but it may also be a project team working in\nisolation. Centrally delivered skills-related activities (whether optional and isolated from\nsubject delivery or 'bolted on') may be well-intentioned but perceived as irrelevant by the\nstudents themselves.\nBudget restraints mean that the printing and distributing of large quantities of paper-\nbased material are not usually possible, or can only be done at critical times (for example,\nin the first term for first-year undergraduates). The nature of the support material - linking\nas it does to study skills, problem-solving and even revision techniques - means that it\nmight be required quickly by students at any time. A small team would probably find it\nimpossible to meet this need on a face-to-face basis, and so the Web seems to present an\nideal means of overcoming several difficulties: materials can be made available to students\nvia a centralized Website, and these will be available at all times and to all students with\naccess to the Internet. However, it raises a number of further issues, which will now be\ndiscussed.\nDesigning Web-based resources for key skills\nA central university Website for key skills will often form the baseline support for students'\nskills development, and many excellent generic Websites have been produced to cover a\nvariety of skills, both by teams in the UK and internationally.1 The resources found on\nthese sites are wide-ranging and include study skills guidelines and materials, Weblinks,\nCAL packages, references to paper-based information or books, and opportunities for\nskills development in extra-curricular activities (such as student tutoring, student union\nactivities or part-time work).\nThe teams producing these kinds of sites may already have compiled large amounts of\npaper-based support materials or produced their own, based on the needs of their\nparticular students. Although there are some examples of where these have simply been\nmade available online as heavily text-based Webpages (perhaps due to staffing or resource\nconstraints), in most cases they have been adapted for publication on the Web.\nThis kind of adaptation is important for usability, and it draws on elements of good\npractice in Web design. Guidelines for Web usability (for example, Nielsen, 2000) centre on\nease of use. Nielsen focuses particularly on fast access to Web-based material: users should\nbe given the easiest and quickest routes to the information they require. Text should be\n'chunked' into small sections so that it is easily scannable by the reader, and long\ndocuments divided logically into separate Webpages which can then be interlinked.\nExternal Weblinks should be selected carefully in terms of their relevance to the user.\n13\nOaire McAvinia Key skills by design: adapting a central Web resource to departmental contexts\nThese design considerations are highlighted here because they are important in the context\nof key skills: learners may need to use this support as they try to complete assignments or\njob applications, or simply because they have a limited amount of time to give to skills\ndevelopment where it is taking place outside the curriculum.\nHowever, the design of an effective generic resource for key skills can also draw on\ninstructional design approaches for the preparation of open and distance learning\nmaterials. The learners using a central key skills Website are at a distance from the team, if\nnot actually categorized as 'distance learners' by the university. Although they may need to\nfind information quickly for one circumstance, they may also seek an opportunity to\ndevelop or learn a particular skill in more depth. Key skills teams will normally have few\nopportunities to meet with the students for whom they design provision, but these\noverlapping requirements in terms of information retrieval and learning objectives must be\naddressed by the resources they produce.\nWhereas Nielsen (2000) advocates design for quick and straightforward information\nretrieval, Rowntree (1994) considers the learners' needs and provides a set of checklists for\neach stage of the preparation of materials. He discusses specific choices for the\nwriter\/designer: the medium, which learning objectives will be met by which materials, the\nmanagement of text and the tone of the text, appropriate use of illustrations, and clear\nguidance around the materials for the learner. Although his suggestions reflect some of the\nconsiderations for a well-designed Website, there is one important difference and it is a\ndifference which arguably needs much greater emphasis in the context of designing Web-\nbased resources for key skills: the materials should show an 'obvious awareness of different\nlearners' needs' (Rowntree, 1994).\nA key skills team is likely to have or to obtain some data on the student population, such as\nthe distribution of age groups and home\/overseas students between various departments,\nand technical information about how the students will access the Web-based resources. All\nof this will help with the design of a generic central Website, but a detailed investigation of\nthe characteristics and needs of the learners raises the issue of different cultures within the\nuniversity itself. Although many key skills teams include members of staff who have taught\n(sometimes as lecturers within the same university) or worked with students over a period\nof time, this 'obvious awareness' may not be there for specific subject groups. In order to\nprovide a useful Web-based resource, the team may need to progress from Nielsen's (2000)\nview of well-organized, speedily available information, to Rowntree's (1994) model of a\ndistance-learning resource designed to meet specific needs, and to be studied over a period\nof time.\nDesigning for different contexts\nIf a Web-based resource for key skills is truly to reflect the needs of its users, then it needs\nto take into account the cultures of the departments in which those learners are located.\nBecher (1989) finds that subject disciplines function in different ways, and that staff\nidentify with the subject community rather than with their respective institutions. This\nsuggests that a 'contextualized' approach to supporting key skills may be more effective\nthan a heavily centralized one. If we treat departments as cultures and design for each in a\ndifferent way, we are contextualizing our approach to supporting learning. This is\n14\nALT-J Volume 10 Number I\nsupported by theories of situated learning, but links also to participatory design, which\nseeks to include the users in the design and implementation of new technologies (Schuler\nand Namioka, 1993).\nBy taking the situated learning and participatory design approaches into account, we\nmight arguably be able to produce materials with greater perceived 'relevance' to the needs\nof the learners. McLoughlin and Oliver (2000) have applied theories of situated learning\nand communities of practice to the field of instructional design. They argue: 'One of the\nlimitations in current instructional design models is that they do not fully contextualize the\nlearning experience, and are themselves the products of particular cultures.' They make a\ndistinction between local sites, designed for one context and culture, and international sites\nthat reach across many cultures. Their use of local and international is not dependent on\ngeographical locations, but rather on culture. In their case, the particular culture is the\nindigenous Australian population, but their work suggests that it may be important to\ndifferentiate between subject cultures too. The reasons to design for an ethnic group, or for\nnon-traditional or part-time learners may be much clearer than the reasons to design\ndifferently for particular subject disciplines. In designing a model for Web-based skills\nresources at UCL, it was decided to try to establish whether contextualizing the resources\nfor particular departments would make a difference to how the materials were received and\nused.\nThe UCL model\nThe UCL key skills Website was developed to support a wider key skills pilot, which ran\nduring the academic session 2000-1. This pilot stemmed from an initial audit of their\ncurricula for key skills by departments, and the subsequent compilation of a list of skills\nwhich tutors felt were essential for their students to have on graduation. A paper-based\nInformation for Staff\nInformation for\nUndergraduate and\nGraduate Students\nIJCLK\nSkill\n\/ \\\neySk llsGr d\nDepartmental Skills\nWebpages\nResource Resource\nResource Resource Resource\nFigure I: Model of the UCL key skills Website\n15\nClaire McAvinio Key skills by design: adapting a central Web resource to departmental contexts\nprofile was distributed to first-year undergraduate students from six departments, asking\nthem to assess their own skills and to identify those needing further development. They\nwere then encouraged to use the Website to support this process.\nThe design of the Website (shown at Figure 1) includes two approaches to the delivery of\nthe resources: a centralized site for key skills and also customized Webpages for depart-\nments. As can be seen from the diagram, the customized pages draw on the resources at the\ncentral site, but provide a different 'front end' from these: this has the aim of 'personal-\nizing' and familiarizing the resource to enhance usability, so that the student can find\nhis\/her way around the materials without having to use the central 'anonymous' skills page.\nThis was not a case of simply 'rebranding' the site with the department's house style for its\nown Webpages: rather, it was designed to allow departments to prioritize certain skills at\ncertain times in a course, and to allow students to take a particular route into the resources\nvia a course topic or type of assignment. A number of wider potential benefits were also\nintended: the departmental skills pages might give ownership of skills development back to\ndepartments without adding to the workload of the academic staff from those depart-\nments, and potentially help skills development to become integrated as part of the\ndepartment's provision.\nIn terms of design, the two means of accessing the support material (generic and subject-\nspecific) reflect aspects of the two models discussed above: Nielsen's (2000) idea of a\nclearly organized, 'just-in-time' resource is important in the design of the central Website.\nRowntree's (1994) guidance for the design of distance-learning resources was also\nconsidered, but arguably to a greater extent in the case of the customized, subject-specific\nsites tailored to particular objectives. However, a variety of models might be called on in\naddressing the needs of different subject disciplines: McLoughlin and Oliver's (2000)\ncourse design principles for 'culturally inclusive instructional design' suggest that a range\nof perspectives may have to be accommodated by the design of resources. This is\nimportant in avoiding a scenario where one culture appears to present another with a\n'deficit model', that is, where a central team or potentially even a course team from a\nsubject discipline may present one design of the resources as the ideal.\nMcLoughlin and Oliver (2000) refer to creating access to a variety of resources in order to\nensure multiple perspectives: the tailored departmental pages provide an opportunity to\npool supporting resources, be they subject-specific (for an assignment), generic (for the\nstudy skills or other skills used in completing that assignment), or a combination of both.\nIn many discipline areas there are supporting subject-specific skills materials available. A\ncustomized Webpage provides tutors with an opportunity to highlight these, and they can\nbridge the gap between generic and discipline-specific resources.\nA further issue relating to content arises in the context of the language and terminology of\nkey skills. Skills lists, and the materials designed to support the development of skills, may\nneed to be adapted to the language of a subject discipline. The definition of a particular\nskill written by the key skills team may have quite a different meaning within a subject\ndiscipline, and the members of that discipline may perceive it as reductive. Alternatively,\nsuch a definition may be irrelevant to the subject discipline where that skill encompasses\nthe whole subject area. One example might be that of numeracy, where a key skills\ndefinition would essentially be meaningless to the members of a mathematics department.\n16\nALT-J Volume 10 Number I\nTherefore, in approaching particular departments to discuss the customization of our\nresources for their students, we encouraged them not only to consider the design,\norganization and content of the Webpages, but to define what they meant by each of the\nskills they hoped the sites would support. They were also asked to look for opportunities to\nprovide authentic ways of using the key skills materials within the coursework, and\nalthough this proved difficult it yielded some positive results which are now discussed.\nExamples of contextualized resources for key skills\nThis section discusses the preparation of two sets of customized key skills pages: one each\nfor the departments of Geography and Biology at UCL. Both sets of pages were produced\nas part of the key skills pilot discussed above.\nDepartment of Geography\nFor this department, the format and structure of the customized pages was discussed with\nacademic tutors and an academic administrator. The pages were then designed in their\ndepartmental 'house' style but they were stored with the key skills Website during the pilot\nphase. Figure 2 shows the customized key skills home page for Geography, and Figure 3\nthe key skills homepage which conforms to the central UCL Web design.\n(Stiff & PastureJust:\n!T*erch\"\n;n] p,\nH s S5t\u00bb1 *\ni s ]\nfee top \u00abf fi\u00ab page to retsrs to the aaa\n\u2022\n J\n*\n; : - \u2022 ] -\"n?*.~f\"r|^Hil-U!lJHl.':^>'';-ftr-i to fea page at asy t=2f by clickir^ oa feis hsacing.\nr \u2022\"* ' \" ^rj^-^\u00bbj^.^^^ Available shorSy; search all &\u2022 resources os feis site.\n5 * * * ^ M 3 5 S J ' ^-\" *V-!Tfit?*^ A selector of resources to si55port stadests a this area.\n2.esources organised aroind &s UCL Key SkSs grid.\nAccess the defeated sk\u00a3s package S-osi cere.\nIofor~aiio= for stadeats recording skJBs (Boa fee isaia site).\nSor;e baci^roirid i for^aioa aad resovrcss.\nFigure 2: The Geography key sk(7\/s homepage\n17\nClaire McAvinia Key skills by design: adapting a central Web resource to departmental contexts\npar\n\u2022Efa \u00a3<S View \u00a3 o\nBack - I \" . - \"\n3\ni Befead Hone Seach Netscape\nsi- 31 |gj\nst's Boated\nPicas* r>\u00ab* thai this site is currency under developtnen; &y gpp.\n. j\n 11 ^44 (\u00a320 7C79 2000 \u00a9 UCL 1588 - 2000\nrii >\nFigure 3: The main key skills homepage\nMentioned previously was the idea that the customized pages could be used by\ndepartments to prioritize particular skills at particular times. In this case, the department\nwished to focus on numeracy skills for one of their undergraduate courses. They felt that\nresources which would help students to revise some of their skills, and then lead into more\ncomplex skills such as data analysis, would be of help in supporting this course. The\nselection of appropriate resources to be included depended on discussion about what\n'numeracy' meant for these courses and these students. The links included quality generic\nresources as well as the staff homepages of the course coordinator, and a range of material\nhe had gathered or noted, but had not previously been able to present to the students in the\ncontext of supporting their coursework.\nThe students were asked to use the site to prepare for a student-led session, and\nsubsequently reported informally that it had been useful for this class. Formal evaluation\nfrom a questionnaire, distributed to the year group as a whole, indicated greater usage of\nthis site and the central site by these students than for students across five other key skills\npilot departments. Although this finding is based on questionnaires distributed to a\nrelatively small group (25 students), it suggests that the inclusion of the contextualized\nresources within course activity had a positive impact on the learners. The tutors' feedback\nfrom the department suggested that they were giving further thought to the ways in which\nWeb-based resources might be used in this area, and it seems likely that the department will\nendeavour to continue this work independently.\n18\nALT-J Volume 10 Number I\nDepartment of Biology\nCustomized pages were designed for the Department of Biology in the latter half of the\npilot phase, when the Web development work was almost complete. These are being\naccessed by students from that department in the current academic session, and as a\nconsequence, there is no formal evaluative data available. This case differed slightly from\nthat of the Geography Department, in that there was no obvious course selected for which\nthe pages could immediately be used as support. This highlights a difficulty in key skills\ndelivery: tutors may have no previous experience of explicitly describing and supporting\nskills in their curricula, and therefore may be unsure of where such support can best be\ngiven.\nIn this case, the tutor involved suggested that the work might be based on an existing audit\nof key skills within the courses offered at undergraduate level by the department. The\ndepartment had produced a 'map' of key skills in the undergraduate curricula and\nrepresented this by means of a paper-based diagram of skills gained in each unit of the\ncourse. The paper-based diagram was converted to an 'image map' (shown at Figure 4)\naround which the key skills resources were organized. Students using the map online are\ndirected from a course unit to details of where the key skills will be gained in that\nparticular unit, with these in turn being mapped to supporting materials.\nfie View \u00a3 o\nAn Overview of Key Skills Acquisition\nQatHs page we Jasst =chde<J a web-based TOKOS of 4e chart oisSssg Biology csgtt courses, a d fee key zk3h acquired\nas each stage.

However, although it adopts the approach of customizing resources, it does not\ninclude them as part of course activity. Without evaluative data it is impossible to assess\nwhether this approach will be more or less successful than that adopted for the Department\nof Geography, and further evaluation with the tutors and students concerned is required.\nLessons from the pilot\nDesign considerations\nThis pilot work involved two approaches to the design and delivery of Web-based key skills\nresources: the central resource and the customized, individual sets of departmental pages.\nIt has demonstrated that a central resource provided in tandem with tailored, customized\nresources for departments may be more effective in delivering support for skills\ndevelopment to undergraduate students than the purely centralized or 'bolt-on' provision\nof generic materials. The design of the central resource may benefit from a consideration\nof the principles of designing for distance learning, as well as those of good Website\ndesign, although here it was difficult to gather large amounts of data to support this view.\nThe adaptation of the resources to particular subject areas is not simply a question of\nchanging the packaging or 'rebranding' them. It requires a meaningful dialogue with\nmembers of the department about the customization of the pages, and could even be\nconsidered in terms of a participatory approach. It is important to find and include\nauthentic, contextually relevant material on these pages as well as links to the generic skills\ndevelopment material, and perhaps most important is to encourage tutors to find\nopportunities to incorporate the material within course activity. Without these\nopportunities the customized resources risk having to be 'bolted on' as generic material has\nbeen in the past (Fallows and Steven, 2000).\nPractical considerations\nWork on the UCL key skills site was undertaken by a Web developer (the author) whose\ntime was exclusively devoted to the design and population of the central Web resource and,\nover time, the customized key skills pages for departments. The outcomes of the pilot\nsuggest that the approach has been effective, but in turn imply that this kind of approach\nneeds a dedicated Web developer on the key skills team. The location of the Web developer\nwithin the team may also be beneficial in terms of awareness of the issues in key skills,\nskills terminology and the range of existing generic resources.\nFuture development\nThe final phase of the pilot envisaged the departments taking responsibility for the pages\nafter the initial pilot phase ended. This process is not complete at UCL, and the transfer is\nnot something we have pressurized the pilot departments involved in this work to do.\nRather, they have been encouraged to think about who would be best placed to take\nresponsibility for the pages and to expand the resources. Not every department will have a\ndedicated Web developer, and in some departments Websites are maintained centrally or\nby an academic who already has a large number of other responsibilities. Therefore, the\ntransfer may not be something that can be done quickly.\n20\nALT-J Volume 10 Number I\nConclusions\nIn spite of the varying extent to which skills policies have been implemented in HE, and the\nmany issues they raise, the evidence of the potential benefits to students of developing\ntheir key skills are now becoming clearer (Fallows and Steven, 2000). Students are being\nencouraged to reflect on their learning, to take responsibility for it and to formulate their\nown objectives for university and life afterwards. They are also learning a language to\ndescribe their abilities and to record their achievements, and are effectively laying the\nfoundations for their lifelong learning.\nAlthough the delivery of skills support to students is problematic, patterns as to how it can\nbest be done are starting to emerge. Drew, Shaw and Mowthorpe (2000) suggest a\ncontinuum whereby generic key skills materials and activities are gradually integrated into\ncoursework, and they document the increased usage of the resources by students where\nthis has been done. This would seem to support the model presented here: a well-designed,\ngeneric Web-based resource may be an effective (and cost-effective) form of baseline\nprovision, but the benefits to students may be greater by adapting and eventually including\nsuch material within course activity.\nThe short timescale of the project described here means that further research would be\nnecessary to determine its long-term impact, and to gather additional evaluative data from\nthe tutors and students involved. However, it does perhaps demonstrate that the nature of\nkey skills support is evolving: if such support is to rely on the Web as its keystone, then a\n'decentralizing' approach may have to be built in to planning and budgeting processes. One\nof the most recent surveys of key skills development as a whole in higher education\nincludes a number of accounts of where face-to-face skills development is now taking\nplace with individual departments, and is considered to be essential in taking the initiative\nforward (Fallows and Steven, 2000). It may well be the case that Web-based support will\nfollow suit.\nA related issue is that of responsibility for the design and development of the Website(s)\nfor a key skills team. If this work is done by a member of the. team, then perhaps that role\ncould increasingly be described as that of a learning technologist or 'new specialist'\n(Beetham, 2001). This may have implications for the needs of such team members in terms\nof staff development and future responsibilities. Where Web development work is carried\nout centrally, there may be a need to examine the resource available for this if support is to\nbe tailored to specific departments. The likelihood of future initiatives needing the same, or\ngreater, degrees of technical support might also have to be examined by the institution.\nOne example of this appears in the related initiative of student profiling, which has the\npotential to make heavy demands on a range of systems (including virtual learning\nenvironments and student records systems) once implemented online.\nThe crossover between learning technologies and Web-based support for key skills is again\nhighlighted by the final report of the continuation project for Key to Key Skills (Drew,\nCatto and Anderson, 2001). In one institution the integration of the project's Key Skills\nOnline package was the catalyst for the institution to begin formulating a policy on online\nlearning. In another case, the implementation of the package was a trigger to frame their\nkey skills policy. Therefore, it seems likely that the design of this kind of provision will\ncontinue to change and grow along with the technologies themselves.\n21\nClaire McAvinia Key skills by design: adapting a central Web resource to departmental contexts\nNotes\n1\n Many examples have been included as hyperlinks from the UCL key skills site:\nhttp:\/\/www.ucl.ac.uk\/keyskills\/grid.html\nReferences\nAtkins, M.
