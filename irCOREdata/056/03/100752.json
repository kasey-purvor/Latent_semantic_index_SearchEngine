The 159Re ions were separated in-flight using the RITU separator and implanted into the\nGREAT spectrometer. The \u03b1 decay emanates from the proton-emitting \u03c0h11\/2 state in 159Re with an energy of\nE\u03b1 = 6776 \u00b1 26 keV and a branching ratio of 7.5 \u00b1 3.5%. This \u03b1 decay populates a state in the closed neutron\nshell nucleus 155Ta, which decays by emitting 1444 \u00b1 15 keV protons with a half-life of 2.9+1.5\u22121.1 ms. These values\nare consistent with the emission of the proton from a \u03c0h11\/2 orbital. These results fit in with the systematics of\nproton and \u03b1-particle separation energies in the region, but disagree with the previously reported decay properties\nof 155Ta.\nDOI: 10.1103\/PhysRevC.75.061302 PACS number(s): 23.50.+z, 23.60.+e, 27.70.+q\nThe quest to understand the complex interactions between\nthe constituent nucleons of atomic nuclei has motivated inves-\ntigations into nuclei under extreme conditions of temperature,\nangular momentum, and isospin. The push to extreme values\nof isospin has resulted in the discovery of many new nuclides\nbeyond the proton drip line, where decay spectroscopy has\nproved to be a highly effective tool for extracting detailed\ninformation about the structure of proton-emitting nuclei [1,2].\nFor proton emitters below the N = 82 neutron shell closure,\nwhere \u03b2 decay is the main competing decay process, the\nidentification has relied on their relatively short half-lives\nwhich allows temporal and spatial correlations with the parent\nnuclei implanted into double-sided silicon strip detectors\n(DSSDs) deployed at the focal plane of a recoil separator. The\nfine segmentation of the DSSDs suppresses the background\nfrom the \u03b2 particles [3], while the ratio of the mass of the\nimplanted ion to its ionic charge state combined with the\nsystematic behavior of proton separation energies can allow\nan unambiguous assignment of the proton decay to a specific\nnuclide. Using this approach, important information about the\ndeformation and single particle structure of these extremely\nneutron-deficient nuclides has been deduced [4,5].\nProton-emitting nuclei have also been extensively studied\nin the region above N = 84, where \u03b1 decay can occur as a\nsignificant competing decay mechanism. Although \u03b1 emission\nreduces the yield of proton peaks when the decays emanate\nfrom the same state and can also give rise to significant\nbackground at energies where proton lines occur, \u03b1 decays do\nprovide the opportunity for correlating proton emitters\u2019 decay\nchains. Consequently, even very weakly produced decay lines\ncan be identified and their decay properties established with\nconfidence. This reliable and sensitive method of correlating\nwith \u03b1 decays has allowed a large number of cases of proton\nemission to be studied, resulting in extensive systematics\nof relative energies of single-particle orbitals and proton\nspectroscopic factors of nuclei in this region [6,7].\nNuclei in the intermediate zone just below N = 84\nrepresent particularly difficult cases for proton decay studies\nbecause correlations with subsequent \u03b1 decays are delayed\nby the \u03b2 decays of intermediate nuclides. Furthermore, less\nneutron-deficient isobars can undergo \u03b1 decay with short\nhalf-lives. This leads to a situation where it is difficult to isolate\nthe proton decays from the background arising from escaping\n\u03b1 particles through correlations with the implanted ions. In\naddition, correlations with the \u03b1-decaying descendants are so\nslow that significant background from random correlations can\nrender the peaks unobservable.\nA prime example of just such a difficult case is the proton\ndecay of the N = 82 nuclide 155Ta studied using the Fragment\nMass Analyzer at the Argonne National Laboratory [8]. The\nbackground in that case arose from the 7.39 MeV \u03b1 decays of\nan isomeric state in 155Lu that has a half-life of only 2.71 ms\n[9] and was produced very strongly as an evaporation residue.\nTo suppress this background, a spectrum was obtained by\nselecting only decay events that occurred within 30 \u00b5s of an\nion implant in the same DSSD pixel and were followed by an \u03b1\ndecay of the great granddaughter 154Yb (see inset to Fig. 1(c)).\nThis second correlation stage is extremely difficult because\nthe average time interval between any proton decay and the\nsubsequent 154Yb \u03b1 decay is over 5 s [9\u201311]. The peak in\nthis final spectrum was assigned as the proton decay of 155Ta\nand comprised six counts at an energy of 1765 \u00b1 10 keV.\n0556-2813\/2007\/75(6)\/061302(5) 061302-1 \u00a92007 The American Physical Society\nRAPID COMMUNICATIONS\nR.

The\nQ-value measured for 159Re in the present work is denoted by\nthe large filled circle. Other data are taken from Refs. [2,7,9,13\u201320].\nThe inset shows the decay paths originating from the \u03c0h11\/2 state in\n159Re. In (a) and (c) filled symbols correspond to the \u03c0h11\/2 states,\nwhile open symbols represent the \u03c0s1\/2 states and the error bars are\nsmaller than the size of the plotted symbols. Solid lines connect values\nfor the same odd-proton configuration in a given isotopic chain.\nEven with such stringent correlation conditions for the first\ndecay, significant levels of background are still evident in the\nspectra [8].\nAlthough the reported decay energy and half-life for 155Ta\nare compatible with emission from a \u03c0h11\/2 orbital, the\nreported proton separation energy of \u22121776\u00b110 keV for 155Ta\n[8] clearly deviates markedly from the monotonic variation\nof the Sp-values as a function of neutron number shown in\nFig. 1(a). The anomaly cannot be attributed to the N = 82\nshell closure, because no corresponding effect is seen for the\nTm or Lu isotopic chains. This deviation is even more striking\nin Fig. 1(b), where the differences in Sp-values of the isotones\nof adjacent odd-Z nuclides [e.g., Sp(153Lu)\u2013Sp(155Ta)] are\nplotted. From these plots, it appears that there is a discrepancy\nof \u223c300 keV in the Sp-value for 155Ta.\nThe recent discovery of proton emission from a \u03c0h11\/2\norbital by 159Re [6] also raises questions about those previously\nreported results for 155Ta [8]. In particular, it is possible\nto deduce the \u03b1-decay Q-value for 159Re, assuming the \u03b1\ndecay feeds the reported proton-emitting state in 155Ta, since\nQ\u03b1(159Re) = Q\u03b1(158W) \u2212 Sp(159Re) + Sp(155Ta) = 6652 \u00b1\n23 keV [6,8,12]. This value appears to be anomalously\nlow compared with the systematics of Q\u03b1-values plotted in\nFig. 1(c) and is in fact even smaller than the value of 6711 \u00b1\n16 keV measured for the neighboring isotope nearer stability,\n160Re [9]. Such a low value is hard to explain and casts further\ndoubt on the assignment of the peak observed in Ref. [8] to\nthe proton decay of the lowest-lying \u03c0h11\/2 state in 155Ta.\nIn this Rapid Communication, the first observation of the\n\u03b1 decay of 159Re is presented, along with the proton decay\nproperties of the state in 155Ta that this populates. These new\nmeasurements benefit from the fast direct correlations between\nthese short-lived decays and are compared with the systematic\nbehavior of nuclei in this region. Possibilities for the origin of\nthe peak previously assigned as the proton decay of 155Ta are\nexplored.\nThe experiment was performed at the Accelerator Lab-\noratory of the University of Jyva\u00a8skyla\u00a8 and has previously\nbeen outlined in Ref. [6], so only a very brief description\nwill be given here. The 159Re nuclei were populated in\nthe 106Cd(58Ni,p4n) complete fusion evaporation reaction. A\nbeam of 300 MeV 58Ni ions bombarded a 1.1 mg\/cm2 thick,\nself-supporting 106Cd target foil of 96.5% isotopic enrichment.\nThe average beam current of 4.7 pnA was delivered over a\nperiod of 75 h. Fusion reaction products were separated in-\nflight using the RITU gas-filled separator [21] and implanted\ninto one of the two DSSDs of the GREAT spectrometer [22].\nEach of the adjacently mounted DSSDs had an active area\nof 60 mm \u00d7 40 mm and a nominal thickness of 300 \u00b5m. The\nstrips on the front surface of the DSSD were orthogonal to\nthose on the back surface and the strip pitch of 1 mm on both\nfaces gave a total of 4800 independent pixels. A multiwire\nproportional counter provided energy loss and (in conjunction\nwith the DSSDs) time-of-flight information to distinguish\nbetween recoiling nuclei and any residual scattered beam.\nIt also provided discrimination between recoil implants and\ndecay events via a simple (anti)coincidence with the DSSDs.\nThe average recoil implantation rate was \u223c2 kHz.\nAll detector signals were passed to the triggerless total\ndata readout data acquisition system [23] where they were\ntime stamped with a precision of 10 ns to facilitate temporal\ncorrelations between recoil implants and their subsequent\nradioactive decays.\nIn the recent report of the discovery of 159Re by Joss\net al. [6], no evidence could be found for \u03b1 decays of 159Re\ncorrelated with proton decays of 155Ta having the previously\npublished properties [8]. However, given the questions sur-\nrounding those 155Ta data, the present data were searched for\nany evidence of an \u03b1-decay branch from 159Re followed by\nproton decays of 155Ta with much less restricted proton energy\n061302-2\nRAPID COMMUNICATIONS\n\u03b1 DECAY OF 159Re AND PROTON EMISSION . . .

The counts\nat \u223c6.8 MeV represent a new activity that is assigned as the \u03b1-decay\nbranch from the \u03c0h11\/2 state in 159Re. The inset shows the energy\nspectrum of decays occurring within 10 ms of events in the 159Re\n\u03b1-decay peak. The peak at \u223c1.4 MeV is assigned as the proton decay\nof the lowest-lying \u03c0h11\/2 state in 155Ta.\nand correlation time constraints. The measured half-life of the\n\u03c0h11\/2 state in 159Re is 21 \u00b1 4 \u00b5s, so any \u03b1-decay branch\nfrom this state should be observed with the same half-life.\nFigure 2(a) shows the energy spectrum of all decays occurring\nwithin 100 \u00b5s of the implantation of an evaporation residue\ninto the same GREAT DSSD pixel. This spectrum is dominated\nby the 7.8 MeV \u03b1 decay of the 0.5 ms 8+ isomer in 156Hf [9].\nFigure 2(b) shows the decays from Fig. 2(a) that were\nthen followed within 10 ms by a signal in the energy range\n1.1\u20131.8 MeV, which would correspond to possible proton\ndecays of 155Ta. Known \u03b1-decay lines below 6.5 MeV\nappear because the broad energy gate for the proton decays\nencompasses part of the energy spectrum of \u03b1 particles that\ndeposit only part of their energy as they escape from the\nDSSD in the backward direction (see Fig. 2 of Ref. [6]).\nThese\u03b1-decay lines then appear through correlations with their\nescaping daughter \u03b1 decays. The 156Hf peak can be understood\nas arising when a 156Hf ion is implanted and decays shortly\nbefore an uncorrelated escaping \u03b1 decay of a longer-lived\nnuclide occurs in the same DSSD pixel. The occurrence of\nthis small number of random correlations reflects the large\nnumber of counts in the 156Hf peak in Fig. 2(a). Reducing this\nproton decay time gate from 10 ms to 100 \u00b5s results in an\nempty spectrum, confirming that there is no evidence in these\ndata for \u03b1 decays of 159Re correlated with the 1776 keV, 12 \u00b5s\nproton activity reported in Ref. [8].\nThe counts at 6776 \u00b1 26 keV represent a new activity, the\nhalf-life of which was measured to be 16 \u00b1 9 \u00b5s using the\nmethod of maximum likelihood [24]. This half-life is an order\nof magnitude too short to result from a nucleus produced in this\nfusion reaction decaying by \u03b1 emission alone, but is consistent\nwith the value measured for the proton decay of 159Re [6]. It\nis therefore assigned as the \u03b1-decay branch of the \u03c0h11\/2 state\nin 159Re. The \u03b1-decay branching ratio measured for this state\nwas 7.5 \u00b1 3.5%.\nThe inset to Fig. 2(b) shows the energy spectrum of events\nthat followed the 159Re \u03b1 decays within 10 ms. The peak\nat 1444 \u00b1 15 keV is assigned as the proton decay of 155Ta.\nCombining the \u03b1-decay Q-value for 159Re with that for this\nproton decay of 155Ta yields a total of 8405 \u00b1 30 keV.\nThis compares with the total of 8428 \u00b1 20 keV obtained by\nsumming the Q-values for 159Re proton-decay [6] and 158W\n\u03b1 decay [12]. These values are mutually consistent, which\nsupports the interpretation that the new correlated activities\nstart from the \u03c0h11\/2 state in 159Re and end at the ground state\nof 154Hf (see inset to Fig. 1(c)). The half-life of this new proton\ndecay line was measured to be 2.9+1.5\u22121.1 ms using the method\nof maximum likelihood [24]. The single count at 1725 keV\noccurs over 2 ms after the first decay, so it is incompatible\nwith the 12 \u00b5s activity assigned as 155Ta in the previous study.\nFurthermore it is inconsistent with the sum of the Q values and\nis therefore presumed to be background.\nThe Q-value for the \u03b1-decay of 159Re measured in the\npresent work is included in the data presented in Fig. 1(c).\nIt fits in well with the systematics, showing the slightly larger\nincrease in Q-value that is observed at N = 84 for the isotones\n155Lu and 157Ta. From the decay energy and branching ratio\nmeasured in the present work and the half-life deduced from\nthe 159Re proton decays [6], a reduced width of \u03b42 = 81 \u00b1\n44 keV is deduced using the method of Rasmussen [25]. This\nagrees well with values measured for decays of nuclei in this\nregion, although the uncertainty is large owing to the small\nnumber of counts.\nThe measurement of an \u03b1-decay branch from 159Re allows\nthe partial half-life for proton emission from this state to\nbe determined. Correcting for the branching ratio gives a\npartial proton decay half-life of 23 \u00b1 6 \u00b5s and the revised\nspectroscopic factor after allowing for the \u03b1-decay branch is\n0.41 \u00b1 0.15. This compares with the expected value of 0.44\nfor a Re proton emitter [7] and does not alter substantially the\nconclusions drawn in ref. [6] about the proton being emitted\nfrom a \u03c0h11\/2 orbital.\nThe half-life measured for the 155Ta proton decay in the\npresent work is much shorter than the value of \u223c330 ms\npredicted for its \u03b2 decay [26], so this \u03b2-decay branch is\nexpected to have a negligible effect on the partial half-life\nfor proton decay. The measured half-life can be compared\nwith values calculated for the different possible proton orbitals\nand the measured 155Ta proton decay energy. Using the WKB\napproximation with the potential of Becchetti and Greenlees\n[27] yields calculated values of 91 ns, 0.78 \u00b5s and 1.8 ms\nfor the s1\/2, d3\/2, and h11\/2 proton orbitals, respectively. The\nmeasured value is only compatible with that calculated for\nthe \u03c0h11\/2 orbital. Furthermore, the present measurements\nfor both 155Ta and 159Re agree well with the systematics of\n061302-3\nRAPID COMMUNICATIONS\nR. D. PAGE et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 75, 061302(R) (2007)\nproton emission for nuclei with Z > 68, provided the protons\nare emitted from h11\/2 orbitals [28]. From the ratio of the\ncalculated and the measured half-life a spectroscopic factor\nof 0.63+0.38\u22120.31 can be deduced. This compares with the value of\n0.55 expected from a low-seniority shell model calculation for\na tantalum isotope [7]. Similar conclusions are reached from\ncalculations performed using either the WKB approximation\nor a two potential method [29] with a potential generated by\nthe Hartree-Fock approach with the SkP Skyrme force [30].\nThe proton separation energy deduced for 155Ta in the\npresent work is included in the data plotted in Fig. 1(a).\nThe new value fits in very well with the systematic trends,\ncontinuing the expected monotonic decrease in Sp-values with\ndecreasing neutron number. This agreement is also evident in\nFig. 1(b), where the new result is seen to follow the smoothly\nvarying behavior established for other nuclides in this vicinity.\nThis is a strong indication that the proton peak observed in the\npresent work represents the decay of the lowest-lying \u03c0h11\/2\nstate in 155Ta.\nThe origin of the previously published results for 155Ta [8] is\nan interesting question. Joss et al. suggested the possibility that\nit could represent the decay of an isomeric state in 155Ta [6].\nIn the lighter N = 82 isotones, seniority 3 (\u03c0h11\/2)327\/2\u2212\nisomers have been identified in the odd-Z nuclides 149Ho,\n151Tm, and 153Lu [31\u201333]. The corresponding isomer in 155Ta\ncould be populated directly in the fusion reaction employed in\nRef. [8], but would not have been fed by the \u03b1 decay of 159Re in\nthe present work. The proton decay of the isomer could decay\ndirectly to the seniority 2 (\u03c0h11\/2)210+ isomer in 154Hf [32,33]\nin order to avoid the hindrance due to configuration changes by\ndecaying directly to the 154Hf ground state. However, a more\nlikely decay path is to the 8+ state in 154Hf, since this would\nbe favored by a higher Q-value than the decay to the 10+ state.\nFigure 3(a) shows the excitation energies of the 27\/2\u2212\nisomers and 8+ states observed in N = 82 isotones plotted as\na function of atomic number. The excitation energies appear\nto follow a parabolic trend for both the odd-Z and the even-Z\nisotones and a parabolic fit allows the excitation energy of the\n27\/2\u2212 state in 155Ta to be estimated. The 27\/2\u2212 states in 14967Ho,\n151\n69Tm, and 15371Lu lie lower in energy than the 8+ states in 14866Dy,\n150\n68Er, and 15270 Yb, which would be the respective daughters of\ntheir proton decays. Consequently, the proton decay Q-values\nof these isomeric states to the 8+ states are lower than those of\nthe 11\/2\u2212 states to the ground states. Figure 3(b) shows this\nreduction in the proton decay Q-value plotted as a function\nof atomic number of the putative proton emitter. In the case\nof 155Ta, the estimated Q-value is comparable with that of the\nlowest-lying \u03c0h11\/2 state and would clearly be incompatible\nwith a value \u223c300 keV larger. Furthermore, the known isomers\nall have very short half-lives (\u223c35\u00b5s, or less), so it would be\nsurprising if an isomer with such an increased excitation energy\nwere not to decay predominantly by \u03b3 -ray emission.\nShell model calculations have been performed by Lawson\n[34] for the N = 82 isotones, assuming that excited states\nare formed by the coupling of the valence h11\/2 protons.\nAlthough these calculations achieve remarkable agreement\nwith the measured properties of these isomeric states, they give\nno indication that other isomers with sufficiently long lifetimes\nshould be expected.

The\n155Ta nuclei were populated through the newly discovered\n\u03b1 decay of 159Re and these short-lived radioactivities have\nallowed clean correlations to be obtained. The measured decay\nproperties are compatible with the decays of \u03c0h11\/2 states\nin both nuclides and provide excellent agreement with the\nsystematic behavior of nuclei in this region. However, they\ndisagree with the previously reported decay properties of\n155Ta. Verifying or discounting those experimental results by\nimproving on the background conditions would be a challeng-\ning but very important measurement. While the difficulties\nof such experiments are amply illustrated by the case of\n155Ta, it does appear that the smooth evolution of nuclear\nproperties can still provide valuable guidance for future inves-\ntigations into nuclear properties at this proton-rich extreme of\nisospin.\nThe authors would like to thank the technical staff at the\nAccelerator Laboratory at the University of Jyva\u00a8skyla\u00a8 for their\nexcellent support and to Paul Morrall from Daresbury Labora-\ntory for making the targets.
