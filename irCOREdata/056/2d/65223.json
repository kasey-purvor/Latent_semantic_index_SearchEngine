Dual loyalty is an odd con-\ncept since as a descriptive term it says little that is not obvious, that\npeople can have more than one political loyalty or commitment. Yet the\nconcept carries a specific tone that questions the justifiability of a plu-\nrality of political loyalties, primarily when they are somehow tied to\none\u2019s relationship to the state. As such, the concept suggests that this\nnormal condition is somehow inherently questionable or problematic,\nand the term is often used to describe the potential threat posed by\ndiasporic or migrant communities. Indeed, citizenship or permanent res-\nidency presumes an obligation of loyalty to the state, and anything that\ncould weaken or challenge this undivided loyalty, such as foreignness\ndue to one\u2019s migrant or diasporic status, can pose a variety of norma-\ntive, theoretical and empirical problems to this presumption. More gen-\nerally, the underlying experience of holding competing and potentially\ncontradictory loyalties is an experience many people have in their per-\nsonal and professional lives and has a history that goes beyond the mod-\nern invention of the citizen. Any person or group could face competing\nloyalties that will cross class, religious, ethnic, familial, political and\ngender lines. Thus, dual loyalty can be used to refer to the common\nemotional experience of being pulled in different directions, to the polit-\nical challenges of choosing an overriding commitment and0or to the reli-\ngious distinction between the profane and the spiritual. The Christian\nAcknowledgments: I would like to thank Robert Kissack for his comments on an\nearlier version of this paper, William Bain for some helpful discussion on this sub-\nject, as well as Avi Kunen and the two anonymous CJPS reviewers.\nIlan Zvi Baron, Lecturer in International Political Theory, School of Government and\nInternational Affairs, Durham University, The Al-Qasimi Building, Elvet Hill Road,\nDurham DH1 3TU, UK ilan.baron@durham.ac.uk.\nCanadian Journal of Political Science \/ Revue canadienne de science politique\n42:4 (December\/d\u00e9cembre 2009) 1025\u20131044 doi:10.10170S0008423909990011\n\u00a9 2009 Canadian Political Science Association ~l\u2019Association canadienne de science politique!\nand0et la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise de science politique\ninjunction of \u201crendering unto Caesar what is Caesar\u2019s and unto God\nwhat is God\u2019s\u201d is an early indication of the variations of the dual loy-\nalty problem.\nHowever, as a modern political problem dual loyalty is not about\nthe body0soul division but about potential challenges to state authority\nand it is this aspect that I am primarily concerned with exploring. Con-\nsequently, it is unsurprising that security discourses are usually involved\nwhen the accusation of dual loyalty is raised, and I argue, following recent\nwork on security ~Buzan et al.,1998!, that the security issues at stake are\nprimarily about national identity and values.\nDual loyalty often refers to many discourses at the same time, and\nfor this, if no other reason, it is important to explore the implications\nand uses of this term. Consequently, I will attempt to clarify the con-\ncept of dual loyalty. This particular intellectual exercise is important for\nat least two reasons. First, dual loyalty is a concept that emerges in a\nvariety of literatures, including those dealing with diasporas, multicul-\nturalism, migration, political obligation and foreign policy. The issue of\ndual loyalty relates to both domestic and international politics. The term\ncan suggest conceptual clarification or function as a political accusa-\ntion. Adding clarity to this term would help bring additional insight to\ndebates that take place in the literature where the term or concept finds\ncurrency. Second, the concept of dual loyalty is itself significant since\nit directly relates to the political foundations of the modern state and\ncitizenship, and to the way in which identity is often understood to func-\ntion both inside and between states. As such, this exploration may bring\ninsight into the normative assumptions that exist in relevant identity\npolitics.\nThere are a variety of historical examples of dual loyalty. Dis-\ncourses of dual loyalty can be found during the English Reformation\nand featured in the trial and death of Thomas More. In this paper, I\ntake examples from across time and space, including those of the Jew-\nish historical experience and that of contemporary Muslim minority\ncommunities. I made this selection because, first, there is significant\nrecognition that the Jewish diaspora experience has almost archetypal\ncharacteristics ~Cohen, 1997! and thus is a good example to use. Sec-\nond, the example of post-9011 conditions faced by Muslim minorities\nprovides a particularly relevant and contemporary illustration of the issues\nI am addressing. Furthermore, I want to place side by side the experi-\nence of two minority groups who tend to view each other with suspi-\ncion due to the politics of the Middle East but may have similar\nexperiences as minority populations in the West. However, before I\naddress in more detail the issue of dual loyalty I want to first contextu-\nalize the problem of loyalty in relation to its related concept of political\nobligation.\n1026 ILAN ZVI BARON\nLoyalty and Obligation\nThe problem of political obligation is a sufficiently important and vague\nissue to have garnered derision and significant attention over the years.\nGenerally speaking, political obligation is about the authority of the state,\nof the nature of law, of why anybody would obey the authority of the\nstate and abide by the law.1 Political obligation, consequently, pertains to\ntheories of state and legal philosophy. Political obligation is also about\nthe subject being obliged, and as such is closely related to moral philos-\nophy as well. In contrast to obligation, with its politico-legal referents,\nloyalty could refer to acts that emerge out of a set of pre-determined\nvalues. Judith Shklar suggests that the difference between loyalty and\nobligation is the rational code that defines political obligation. She writes,\n\u201cBy obligation I mean rule-governed conduct, and political obligation\nspecifically refers to laws and lawlike demand, made by public agen-\ncies\u201d ~Shklar, 1993: 183!. On loyalty she writes, \u201cWhat distinguishes loy-\nalty is that it is deeply affective and not primarily rational.... If obligation\nis rule driven, loyalty is motivated by the entire personality of an agent.\nPolitical loyalty is evoked by nations, ethnic groups, churches, parties,\nand by doctrines, causes, ideologies, or faiths that form and identify asso-\nciations\u201d ~Shklar, 1993: 184!. In this explanation of loyalty, the missing\nelement is a legal structure that defines what one is expected to do or\nnot to do and that provides a rational basis for defining what a political\nobligation is. Loyalty is, in this sense, even vaguer than political obliga-\ntion since it relies not on theories of state or philosophies of law but on\nmoral expectations.\nIn Shklar\u2019s terms, the problem of dual loyalty would be that one\u2019s\nloyal commitments infringe on one\u2019s political obligations to the state. In\nother words, that one\u2019s emotional commitments conflict with one\u2019s ratio-\nnal and legal requirements as a citizen. Here the distinction between obli-\ngation and loyalty is especially tricky, since not only is the term \u201cdual\nAbstract. Dual loyalty arises when a citizen or group of citizens holds political allegiance to\nanother state or entity which could challenge their loyalty to the state. What defines dual loy-\nalty as an accusation is the assumption that it is impossible to hold multiple political loyalties,\nbut that, simultaneously, this multiplicity is denied any validity. This article explores the con-\ncept, locating it historically and locating the false and often racist discourse that characterizes\nits modern usage and meaning.\nR\u00e9sum\u00e9. La double loyaut\u00e9 survient quand un citoyen ou un groupe de citoyens donne son\nall\u00e9geance \u00e0 un autre \u00c9tat ou \u00e0 une autre entit\u00e9, ce qui pourrait mettre en cause sa loyaut\u00e9\nenvers l\u2019\u00c9tat. Ce qui conf\u00e8re \u00e0 la double loyaut\u00e9 un caract\u00e8re d\u2019accusation, c\u2019est la supposition\nqu\u2019il est impossible d\u2019avoir plusieurs all\u00e9geances politiques, et que, simultan\u00e9ment, cette mul-\ntiplicit\u00e9 d\u2019all\u00e9geances n\u2019a aucune validit\u00e9. Le pr\u00e9sent article explore ce concept, en le situant\nsur le plan historique et en retra\u00e7ant les discours faux et souvent racistes qui caract\u00e9risent son\nemploi et son sens modernes.\nloyalty\u201d sometimes used in ways which do not fit this understanding, but\nthere are elements of political obligation that also do not fit. Indeed,\nShklar\u2019s requirement that rationality plays a role in political obligation is\ndisputed by Hanna Pitkin ~1972! who challenges the idea that rationality\ncan explain political obligation. Moreover, the idea that loyalty is emo-\ntional, in contrast to the rationality of political obligations, is difficult to\naccept. The basis of any political obligation requires a judgment about\nwhether or not the obligating agent should have obligatory powers and\nwhether or not one wants to abide by obligations demanded. Obligation\ninvolves the problem of choice, which involves the problem of agency,\nwhich involves more than any rational calculus can provide. Emotion could\neasily play a role in political obligation. Shklar\u2019s definitions here are help-\nful but they are limited.\nConsequently, I want to suggest a related but slightly different way\nto frame the relationship between political obligation and ~political! loy-\nalty. For the sake of analytical clarity, I will accept the argument that\nbinds political obligation to the state and to the law, but I want to sug-\ngest that loyalty also contextualizes and can justify political obligations.\nThe judgments that one takes which make political obligation possible\ninvolve an account of loyalty to the state and to the institutions of the\nstate. The strict divide between rational political obligations and possibly\nirrational emotional loyalties does not work. Emotional ties will contrib-\nute toward justifying one\u2019s political obligations and, as Pitkin suggests,\nit is possible to be obliged for irrational reasons. For the problem of dual\nloyalty to make terminological sense, loyalty can conflict with political\nobligations to the state when there are normative judgments that chal-\nlenge the reasons for one\u2019s political loyalty to the state.\nThere is a reason for this framing of the problem of obligation and\nloyalty. I am not aiming to provide an argument for political obligation\nbut a theory to analyze the problem of dual loyalty. In this regard, it is,\nto my mind at least, necessary to recognize, first, that loyalty involves\nnormative claims and second, that political obligation is justified when\nits normative basis can command the loyalty of the obliged. The problem\nof dual loyalty arises when there is a tension between the first and the\nsecond.\nDual Loyalty in Political Thought\nAt a minimum, dual loyalty functions as a descriptive term referring to\ndifferent and potentially competing loyalties, commitments and0or obli-\ngations. In medieval political thought dual loyalty was a problem, but it\nwas also accepted as a basic feature of the body0soul duality that char-\nacterizes human life. St. Augustine was particularly keen on this topic\n1028 ILAN ZVI BARON\n~Augustine, 1998, 2001!. He emphasizes that while the deeds that one\ncarries out are important, it is more important to ensure a pure soul and\nthus achieve eternal salvation. Augustine takes it for granted that people\nwill face the dual loyalty between body and soul; the problem is in under-\nstanding how the duality functions in order to find eternal salvation.\nOf course, the spiritual0temporal divide is not as clear as I am sug-\ngesting. During his own time Augustine was faced with having to address\nnumerous cases where temporal rulers faced religious obstacles, reli-\ngious leaders faced religious obstacles to their political goals, and lay\npeople were faced with the eternal tension between the desires of the\nbody and the needs of the soul that characterize a life of sin made pos-\nsible by Adam and Eve\u2019s folly. Moreover, and centuries later, the reli-\ngious wars of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries contributed to the\nconditions under which dual loyalty could become a serious political prob-\nlem. Yet, whereas previously dual loyalty was contextualized by a body0\nsoul dualism, these wars contributed to a modern account that framed\ndual loyalty as a conflict between opposing political loyalties in the tem-\nporal world. Insofar as loyalty to the state or its equivalent is concerned,\ndual loyalty has been a consistent reality across history as rulers and reli-\ngious leaders respectively tried to consolidate their authority and estab-\nlish an order on the known world. However, whereas medieval Christian\nthought framed it as a problem emerging out of humanity\u2019s innate dual-\nity in a life of sin, modern thought frames it as a problem that leads to\ninstability and even war.\nThe religious wars that led to the Peace of Westphalia \u201cwere fought\naround the question of political loyalty\u201d and whether or not one can \u201cbe\nloyal to the state when one is not following the religion of the state\u201d ~van\nder Veer, 2002: 96!. These wars demonstrated that religious loyalties could\ncome into violent conflict with temporal loyalties and obligations, thereby\nsuggesting that any kind of dual loyalty poses a serious problem to domes-\ntic and international stability. The proposed solution was to concentrate\nauthority into a single locus of political sovereignty in each state. The\nPeace of Augsburg ~1555! and of Westphalia ~1648! that ended these wars\nand ushered in the modern state system established a system dedicated\nto removing overlapping hierarchies and diversity from state founda-\ntions, and institutionalizing a single locus of sovereignty in order to main-\ntain order and prevent war. This \u201cempire of uniformity ... established in\ntheory ... the premise that the sovereign people who establish the consti-\ntution are already culturally indifferent members of one society who aim\nto set up a regular constitutional association with a single locus of sov-\nereignty\u201d ~Tully, 1995: 83!.\nBehind this Westphalian system of uniformity was the fear that reli-\ngious minorities would maintain a loyalty outside of the state where they\nreside. The proposed solution was the principle of cujus regio ejus reli-\nThe Problem of Dual Loyalty 1029\ngio ~like sovereign, like religion!. Consequently, \u201csubjects either com-\nplied with the established religion of the sovereign or migrated to another\njurisdiction where their religious beliefs prevailed\u201d ~Preece, 2006: 142!.\nWhile medieval political thought sought to reconcile the conflict between\nbody and soul, modern political thought wanted to eradicate any such\nkind of conflict from politics and, for that matter, get rid of as much\ndiversity as possible from the state\u2019s foundations.\nNevertheless, it remained acceptable up until the mid- to late 1800s\nfor individuals to shift their political loyalties across states. During this\ntime it was not uncommon to find nationals of one country serving in the\nmilitary of another, but this practice became considerably more treacher-\nous as the nation-state took over the normative conditions of political loy-\nalty and political obligation.Yet, while the idea of the modern-nation state\nis theoretically antithetical to nationals having justifiable yet opposing\npolitical commitments or allegiances, dual loyalty would carry no sense\nor weight as a term if it did not refer to a recognizable practice. In the mod-\nern era of the nation-state dual loyalty should, in theory, not exist. Con-\nsequently and paradoxically, there is something especially modern about\nthe concept of dual loyalty, and \u201cas Hobbes, and other political thinkers\nrealized, it was the nature of the state that was at issue here\u201d ~van der Veer,\n2002: 96!. The modern solution, as articulated by Hobbes ~1996! is that\nstate stability requires a unified allegiance to the sovereign, and the way\nto achieve this common political obligation is with the social contract, out\nof which many equal but at risk individuals become one commonwealth.\nThe movement toward uniformity made dual loyalty a serious prob-\nlem, since it suggested a fragmentation of the foundations of the sover-\neign state. These foundations are based on the idea of a single locus of\npolitical loyalty and tie this loyalty to state security. It seemed that if\npeople had multiple loyalties authority could not be ensured and insta-\nbility ensued, both in relation to domestic control and international rela-\ntions. Of course, the nation-state takes for granted the fidelity of its\ncitizens, but in the case of migrants this loyalty is questioned because of\nthe perception that migrants are susceptible to dual loyalty. What the Peace\nof Westphalia termed a problem of religious faith modernity redefined\nas an issue pertaining to the loyalty of migrant communities ~van der\nVeer, 2002!. As David Miller writes, \u201cThe deeper question is how far\nimmigrant groups can be expected to make the nation-state they move to\ntheir primary object of political allegiance. It is very common for mem-\nbers of such groups to retain a strong emotional attachment to the coun-\ntry they have left and therefore to feel some loyalty to it.... But what\nshould we say when loyalties conflict?\u201d ~Miller, 2008!. Miller argues that\ncitizenship is about mutual protection, and this normative goal should\ndetermine the answer to such questions. It is important not to portray a\nstraw person here, but there is a notable history behind modern politics\n1030 ILAN ZVI BARON\nthat premises state stability on a version of homogeneity that provide the\ncontext to Miller\u2019s questions and his answers.\nThe challenge for such theorists has been to sort out how difference\nor pluralism can successfully find a place in the modern state which has\nnever really been homogenous in the first place ~Kymlicka, 1995; Kym-\nlicka and Norman, 2000!. In this debate the predicament of dual loyalty\nposes a particularly disturbing problem because of the implication that\nmigrant and diasporic communities will retain ties to their homeland and\nthus pose a threat to the perceived state homogeneity. In this modern\ndiscourse dual loyalty becomes a threat to the state itself. This discourse\nof dual loyalty is perhaps the most politically concerning since it relies\non a variety of foundational claims that dominate political thought and\nmodern political life and should not be taken for granted or accepted\nuncritically.\nIn conclusion, dual loyalty as a problem has a paradoxical relation-\nship to the modern state system. Dual loyalty suggests that the state can-\nnot necessarily take for granted the unconditional allegiance of the nation\nbecause the nation-state may actually be a group of nations with differ-\nent loyalties. The paradox is that by recognizing dual loyalty, either, for\nexample, as a challenge to state authority or as a possible reason for con-\nscientious objection, the nation-state is accepting that it is not really a\nnation-state but a nations-state or pluralist state when the idea behind\nthe modern nation-state is a rejection of this plurality. Thus the possibil-\nity of dual loyalty implies that the Westphalian solution has not resolved\none of the key problems that it was supposed to: the potential for discord\nor violence because of multiple political allegiances.\nDiscourses of dual loyalty appear in a variety of guises. Sometimes\ndual loyalty is perceived to function as a product of one\u2019s ethnicity or\nreligion, and other times it may be purely ideological as was the case in\nthe United States during the communist witch hunts of the 1950s. Regard-\nless of these different dual loyalty discourses, dual loyalty is inherently a\ndiscourse related to a variety of security concerns: state security, national\nsecurity0integrity, the security of a minority group. Consequently, in the\nfollowing sections I provide various examples that illustrate how dual\nloyalty functions as an accusation and how it is related to security dis-\ncourses. The examples suggest that dual loyalty is an inherently problem-\natic discourse, often linked to prejudice, discrimination, hierarchy and\nsometimes oppression.\nThe Accusation\nIn Damascus in 1840 a Capuchin friar disappeared and a Jewish barber\nwas arrested and charged with the ritual murder of the friar. The barber\nwas tortured and after a forced confession a mob attacked the local Jew-\nThe Problem of Dual Loyalty 1031\nish community. The charge against this innocent Jewish barber revived\nthe blood libel accusation common in the Middle Ages ~Mendes-Flohr\nand Reinharz, 1995!. The French government became involved, due to\nits Middle Eastern ambitions, and supported the charges against the Jew-\nish barber. French Jews were, consequently, placed in a difficult posi-\ntion. As French citizens they should support France\u2019s ambitions in the\nMiddle East, but as Jews they could not stand behind their government\u2019s\nsupport of a malicious crime against Jews. In the end, due to the involve-\nment of a Jewish French politician, Adolphe Cr\u00e9mieux, the Jewish pris-\noners in Damascus were released. However, this victory was not without\nconsequences. \u201cThe outcome was an apparent victory in humanitarian\nterms but... it was a Pyrrhic one. Thereafter, French patriots argued that\nlove of their brethren would always be greater than the love of the French\nJews for France\u201d ~Cohen, 1996: 510!. At issue here was not the collec-\ntive right of a group to protest, but the concern that a minority popula-\ntion cares more about its own kin abroad than it does about the national\ninterests of their country of residence.\nIn this regard, and paradoxically, dual loyalty took on a potentially\ninsidious turn once it became framed by the modern ideal of universal\nequality. The paradox of the Declaration of the Rights of Man ~1789!\nwas to simultaneously reject and emphasize human difference. This par-\nadox is neatly summed up by Hannah Arendt who notes that, \u201cThe more\nequal conditions are, the less explanation there is for the differences that\nactually exist between people, and thus all the more unequal do individ-\nuals and groups become\u201d ~Arendt, 1986: 54!. In a system ostensibly built\non a premise of uniformity, pluralism can suggest a foundational threat\nto the integrity of the nation and state.\nRecognizing this paradox, minority populations sometimes over-\nemphasize their loyalty and commitment to the majority in order to stave\noff dual loyalty charges. Historically, minority populations have often tried\nto demonstrate their loyalty to the state by participating in local customs\n~Sarna, 1981!. The Jewish minority population in the newly formed United\nStates of America demonstrated precisely such a reaction:\nPresident Washington himself had assured @the Jews# of \u201cliberty of conscience\nand immunities of citizenship.\u201d All that America seemed to demand in return\nwas loyalty, devotion and obedience to law. Jews kept their side of the bargain.\nThey displayed their patriotism conspicuously, and diligently copied prevail-\ning Protestant standards of behaviour. In return, they won many new rights\nand opportunities. Yet, they failed to receive hoped-for equality. Instead, pop-\nular anti-Jewish suspicions lived on, and reaction set in. Missionaries arose to\nconvert Jews, and succeeded in rekindling old hatreds. Many Americans, espe-\ncially those affected by religious revivals ~\u201cthe Second Great Awakening\u201d! and\nanti-Enlightenment romantic currents, insisted anew that America was a \u201cChris-\ntian country.\u201d ~Sarna, 1981: 157!\n1032 ILAN ZVI BARON\nThis account clearly places the Jewish minority at odds with the Chris-\ntian majority due to the prejudices of the majority.2\nHowever, while a majority may claim that the migrant community\nneeds to share in the values and participate in local customs in order to\ndemonstrate its inclusiveness, it is also up to the majority to decide when\na minority has done enough to satisfy the expectations of assimilation.\nIn this regard a minority population is always potentially suspect of not\nfulfilling these expectations over assimilation and is thus always subject\nto the possibility of a dual loyalty accusation. The Jews in America even-\ntually overcame this prejudice, but it is noteworthy that Jean-Paul Sartre\nrecognized a similar logic at work in racist discourse ~Sartre, 1995!, and\nthis similarity provides one further characteristic of the modern account\nof dual loyalty. It is undeniable that the charge of dual loyalty often func-\ntions in large part in relation to racist discourse.\nDuring the Second World War, Canadians and Americans of Japa-\nnese ancestry were deemed suspicious and potentially dangerous to the\nstate. In 1941, the Canadian and American governments confiscated fish-\ning boats and property of residents and citizens of Japanese origin. These\npolicies accelerated after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on Decem-\nber 7, 1941. Canadians and Americans of Japanese ancestry were required\nto register with their respective government and by 1942 were being\ninterned in camps. In the United States the internment camps were not\nclosed until 1946, although it took until 1965 to resolve all legal com-\npensation claims. In Canada, it took until 1949 for Japanese-Canadians\nto regain the right to travel freely inside the country, and it was not until\n1988 that a formal apology and compensation were issued. These citi-\nzens and residents were persecuted because of their ethnic origin, and it\nwas believed that somehow their ancestry meant that during a war against\nthe Japanese they would turn against their adoptive country and side with\nthe \u201chomeland.\u201d The liberal democracies of America and Canada acted\non the assumption that ethnic identity could pose a security threat because\nof a potential for dual loyalty on the part of a minority population. It is\nnoteworthy that those of German and Italian descent were not subject to\nthe same treatment, thus further suggesting the inherent racism in this\ncase. The treatment of this visible minority may have been pure racism,\nbut it was dual loyalty concerns that provided the justification and secu-\nrity basis for their internment and persecution. This example further illus-\ntrates the racist and international character that characterizes the dual\nloyalty accusation.\nThe specter of dual loyalty often emerges out of the practices of\ninternational relations and state foreign policy. In this vein, and writing\nabout contemporary American foreign policy, Yossi Shain notes that, \u201cIn\nengaging in the politics of the country of origin ~home-country!, dias-\npora activists and organizations may become entangled in conflicting alle-\nThe Problem of Dual Loyalty 1033\ngiances. They must justify their actions in terms of American national\ninterests and values, answer to their US ethnic compatriots, and prove\ntheir loyalty to their home country\u201d ~1994\u20131995: 813!.\nAs an accusation, dual loyalty can originate not only in the state where\none resides but also from one\u2019s country of origin ~Shain, 1994\u20131995!,\nwhich can pose additional complications for diasporic groups. There are\na variety of ways that dual loyalty functions as an accusation. Conse-\nquently, the modern accusation of dual loyalty can refer to racist ideol-\nogy or racial prejudices in society, the logic of the nation-state and its\nsecurity interests, and0or the practices of international politics that per-\ntain to diasporic and migrant community relations to their kin or homeland.\nThis variety of dual loyalty discourse, nevertheless, relates to vari-\nous security issues, be it in regard to territorial integrity, national values,\nforeign policy or national identity. For dual loyalty to make any kind of\nsense ~however problematic or morally disturbing! it is to the extent that\nthere is a sense that security is based on a kind of homogenous patrio-\ntism and national identity, where migrant communities, ethnic minori-\nties, or diasporic populations are faced with having to prove their loyalty\nto the state. Consequently, dual loyalty is, I think, primarily an accusa-\ntive phrase. While it should be obvious that people have many loyalties\nduring the course of their lives and these will most likely come into con-\nflict at various points during their lives, insofar as loyalty to the state is\nconcerned, there is a severely limited tolerance for such conflicts express-\ning themselves in public life. The accusation of dual loyalty is primarily\nframed as a security issue, although, as I will now argue, it forms a secu-\nrity debate that is really more about racism than any actual security risk.\nDual Loyalty and Security\nDual loyalty can function as a security risk in at least two ways: first,\nwhen the minority community fears the accusation of dual loyalty; sec-\nond, when the state or the majority perceive a minority to be guilty of\ndual loyalty or posing a risk of dual loyalty. Briefly in the 1980s, Amer-\nican Jews were concerned about the dual loyalty threat arising in relation\nto the espionage of Jonathan Pollard, an American Jew who was recruited\nby Israel to spy on the United States. \u201cThis scandal was deeply embar-\nrassing to American Jewry. It demonstrated on the part of some Israeli\nofficials a lack of sensitivity to the US-Israel relationship and to the sus-\nceptibility of US Jews to false charges of \u2018dual loyalty\u2019\u201d ~Eizenstat, 1990\u2013\n1991: 97!. Many American Jews viewed him as a pariah and traitor to\nhis country.3 By this time there was little chance of the Jewish com-\nmunity\u2019s falling under the accusatory shadow of dual loyalty, but the\nembarrassment of the scandal arose because it provided a tangible case\n1034 ILAN ZVI BARON\nof perceived dual loyalty, something that Jews have historically been sen-\nsitive to.\nThe second security discourse is based on the perception of a minor-\nity posing a security risk. It is irrelevant whether or not the minority\nposes an actual security risk, since at issue is the perception of one.\nIndeed, threats are always based on perception ~Jervis, 1976!, and ulti-\nmately, if frustratingly, it may not make much difference if the threat is\n\u201creal\u201d or \u201cimagined\u201d so long as it is perceived. It is the second security\ndiscourse that is more troubling, since the possibility of a minority feel-\ning a looming shadow of dual loyalty accusations functions only to the\nextent that a majority can make such an accusation with consequences to\nfollow. In this regard, dual loyalty discourse presumes that a minority\nshould be loyal to the state but then rejects this presumption or expecta-\ntion of loyalty because of the simultaneously held belief that minorities\ncannot be counted on in this way. In this aspect, dual loyalty is particu-\nlarly concerning, because it illustrates a condition whereby the minority\nis made to suffer by the actions of a majority that refuses to recognize\nthe harassing and hierarchical nature of its actions. Consequently, by their\nself-perception as a controlling majority they make it possible to per-\nceive the potential of a minority to become disloyal, subversive, and pos-\nsibly even treasonous against the society they live in. As such, any\npractices seen to be different from those of the majority could constitute\na potential indicator of dual loyalty. Consequently, the differences of\nminority groups are easily construed to pose various kinds of security\nrisks. Multiple examples of this kind of discourse have prevailed in Brit-\nish debates over Muslim communities, new immigrants, and British values.\nIn relation to immigration and security, Sita Bali writes that, \u201cImmi-\ngration is... perceived to have an impact on a nation\u2019s security. Immigrant\ncommunities tend to maintain a strong connection with their home coun-\ntries, and turbulence or instability in those societies can find expression\nwithin the immigrant community as well, thereby bringing external prob-\nlems into host societies\u201d ~2001: 182!. The security dynamic at work here\nis with how identity itself is perceived to pose security risks. Conse-\nquently, the language used to address these perceived security threats\ninvariably refers to some of the key features identified by Albert Memmi\n~2000! as racist, primarily discourses of xenophobia and thus exclusion\nand prejudice due to perceptions of difference made possible by hierar-\nchical relations. Indeed, \u201cAny attempt to classify types of threats from\nimmigration quickly runs into distinctions between \u2018real\u2019 and \u2018perceived\u2019\nthreats, or into absurdly paranoid notions of threat or mass anxieties that\ncan best be described as xenophobic and racist\u201d ~Weiner, 1992\u20131993: 104!.\nCurrently, the ostensible empirical reason for this fear is the \u201chome-\ngrown\u201d terrorist. The home-grown terrorist label is controversial. Its usage\nis often connected to minority communities and thus suggests a mis-\nThe Problem of Dual Loyalty 1035\nguided linkage to immigrants and often Muslims. Indeed, the Canadian\nsecurity pundit David Harris has specifically targeted Muslims as a threat\nand questioned why security officials have refrained from referring to\nIslam or Muslims as threats ~Frum, 2006!. To put this kind of rhetoric in\nperspective, however, we should recall that the Oklahoma City bombing\nin 1995, in which 168 people were killed and over 800 wounded, was\nperpetuated by white supremacists, not Muslim terrorists as was initially\nclaimed ~Halliday, 2003!. Here was an instance of a home-grown terror-\nist attack, and the initial response was to claim that Muslims were behind\nit, thereby suggesting that it is somehow easier to view visible minorities\nto be threats.\nSo-called home-grown terrorists have appeared in Canada, Ger-\nmany, the United Kingdom and the United States. In each case, the state\nbecame concerned with how attached its residents were to constituencies\nin distant countries, and, crucially, how these commitments involved a\nfundamental and violent clash against the country in which they lived.\nWith echoes of an extreme form of alienation, these isolated cases have\ncontributed to a concern over the enemy within our midst, of minority\ngroups posing security risks, not just to the national value system and\nnational identity but to the state\u2019s ability to control acts of violence inside\nits borders. These cases suggest not so much examples of dual loyalty as\nof extreme and violent antagonism toward one\u2019s home state. Neverthe-\nless, it is within the context of dual loyalty fears that such home-grown\nthreats are addressed.\nIt is in this context that Lord Goldsmith, the former attorney gen-\neral of England and Wales, proposed that upon graduation all students\nshould participate in a citizenship ceremony involving a pledge of alle-\ngiance to the Queen ~Goldsmith, 2007; \u201cPupils \u2018To Take Allegiance\nOath,\u2019\u201d 2008; Ryan, 2008!. Furthermore, in his related report migration\nis mentioned as an issue of concern for British values and security ~Gold-\nsmith, 2007!. Goldsmith also proposed a new national holiday to cel-\nebrate \u201cBritishness,\u201d similar to national days in Australia and Canada.\nWhat is interesting about Goldsmith\u2019s proposal is not that a Scottish rep-\nresentative did not support the idea, but that it does not seem to be tied\nto a founding moment of the United Kingdom but to a normative princi-\nple that involves confirming allegiance to the values and protection of\nthe state0nation. Goldsmith links the oath that students should take to\nthe one taken by newly naturalized citizens. However, other than xeno-\nphobia and0or racism, whether there are empirical grounds for concern\nfor a weakening of \u201cBritish values\u201d and \u201cBritish identity\u201d due to popu-\nlation diversity is questionable.\nAn examination of the last UK census, conducted in 2001, does not\nsupport the claim that the UK is a multicultural society at risk of a demo-\ngraphic calamity threatening the majority\u2019s identity. It found that 71.6\n1036 ILAN ZVI BARON\nper cent of England, Wales and Scotland remain Christian; 92.1 per cent\nof the population is white; 5.2 per cent of the population classify them-\nselves as members of religious minority groups comprised of 6 different\nreligions\u2014the largest of these was Muslim at 2.7 per cent ~\u201cReligion In\nThe UK.\u201d 2001!\u20147.9 per cent of the population is made up of minority\nethnic groups ~\u201cPopulation Size: Ethnicity.\u201d 2001!; 45 per cent of the\nminority ethnic population resides in London. The distribution of the UK\u2019s\nminority population is highly uneven, with the cumulative effect that the\nrest of the UK has minorities but can hardly lay claim to being much of\na multicultural society outside of London. Indeed, the UK would have at\nbest an ambivalent and uncertain commitment to multicultural values\n~Kymlicka, 2003!.\nThese data are not as recent as I would like and the next census may\nhave a different result. Nevertheless, taking the government\u2019s data it is\nodd that there is concern over the loyalty and political self-identification\nof the general public when the minority is less than 10 per cent of the\npopulation and just under half of the minority population resides in one\ncity\u2014an empirical situation that I suspect has not changed much since\nthis data was produced. The fact that, according to the last census, Mus-\nlims make up less than 3 per cent of the British public would indicate\nthat the threat of Muslims to the British nation is very low, if indeed\nthere even is such a threat. Nevertheless, due to domestic and inter-\nnational events, there are increasing concerns over linkages between iden-\ntity, obligation and security. Goldsmith\u2019s report was in response to a\nconcern over public loyalty and national identity, particularly in light of\nthe London bombings in July 2005 and an attack in 2007 at Glasgow\nairport by so-called home-grown terrorists.\nThese attacks are terrifying but they do not suggest a threat to the\nnational identity or value system. Consequently, the danger must be one\nof ideas about and perceptions of the possibility that citizens may find\nloyalties to communities outside of the UK, thus posing a form of secu-\nrity risk to the nation, and in the case of Muslims in the UK the dis-\ncourse has been shown to be heavily racist ~Kyriakides et al., 2009!. It\ncan be difficult to get one\u2019s head around the logic of this kind of security\ndiscourse since the perceived threats are of generally law-abiding and\nproductive members of society who happen to belong to minorities. The\ndiscourse functions as a security concern precisely because of the per-\nception that minority groups are not loyal enough to the host land, that\nthey share some of the common political obligations to the state ~they\nobey the law, for example!, but they cannot be counted on to become\n100 per cent committed residents ~whatever that would mean! due to loy-\nalties they have to their non-Christian religion or homeland or kin abroad.\nThat government officials seem to be constantly claiming that Muslims\nare not the target is, more than anything else, an indication that they are.\nThe Problem of Dual Loyalty 1037\nThese issues are often framed in terms of pluralism or multicultur-\nalism, with dual loyalty referred to by euphemisms that suggest a path\ntoward national homogeneity. In the liberal vernacular, the problem of\ndual loyalty is addressed in debates over cultural assimilation and minor-\nity rights. The multicultural0assimilation literature is often about the prob-\nlem of dual loyalty, and this debate emerged in precisely dual loyalty\nterms in officially multicultural Canada.\nMulticulturalism as a policy was denounced for many of the same reasons\nassimilationists have always raised against the maintenance of ethnicity. It would\nbreed \u201cdouble consciousness\u201d\u2014loyalty to more than one country\u2014it would\ncontribute to turning immigrant quarters into permanent ethnic ghettos; it would\nslow the process of overcoming an ignorance of English and French that made\nthe immigrants exploitable in the past. ~Wilson, 1993: 626!\nThese issues have been raised again in response to the 17 Muslims in\nToronto who were arrested in June 2006 on charges of plotting to bomb\nareas in and around Toronto. This debate has also taken place in the United\nStates and Europe, often in relation to the threat posed by terrorism.\nThe impact of terrorism inside the United States, Spain and Britain has led\nboth to a crisis in multiculturalism as a principle for organizing modern dem-\nocratic societies and to the fear that the old notion of \u201cthe enemy within\u201d ~given\nfull rein in the Cold War, but in fact harking back via the European wars of\nreligion to the wooden horse of Troy! now applied to communities whose loy-\nalty to a transnational religion might lead them into acts of violence against\ntheir own fellow citizens. ~Aggestam and Hill, 2008: 106!\nSince there are so few instances of minorities turning violent against\nthe majority, one would presume that such communities provide no real\nthreat to the state or nation. Yet, for many people too much cultural dif-\nference inside the state is a problem, and debates on these issues tend to\nspeak to an often imaginary but comfortable ideal of uniformity and famil-\niarity. It is difficult to find another reason why the debate in the UK over\nthe Archbishop of Canterbury\u2019s remarks about Sharia law became so\nheated. The issues contained in such debates were especially apparent in\na series of exchanges during the Presidential election over Barack Obama\u2019s\nfaith. First, there was the suggestion that Obama was Muslim and that\nthis could jeopardize his commitment to the state ~Luttwak, 2008!. Sec-\nond, there was John McCain\u2019s response that Obama is not a Muslim but\n\u201ca decent family man\u201d ~Brown, 2008!. The correct answer, as Colin Pow-\nell stated when he endorsed Obama, should have been, what does it mat-\nter if he is Muslim ~Johnson, 2008!?\nPowell was right, and these debates are odd. It should not be taken\nfor granted that dual loyalty has to be a problem and that minorities are\nthreats. Surely the state is strong enough to manage the possibility of\n1038 ILAN ZVI BARON\nsome of its citizens being in difficult moral dilemmas about where to\nplace their political loyalty. Indeed, the fact that such identity conflicts\nhave rarely weakened the state is an indication of how this problem\nis primarily over normative assumptions and not state stability. As\nAnthony D. Smith argues,\nConflicts between loyalty to a national state and solidarity with an ethnic\ncommunity, within or outside the boundaries of that state, may lead to accu-\nsations of \u201cdual loyalties,\u201d and families may find themselves torn between\nthe claims of competing communities and identities. There is in fact always\nthe potential for such identity conflicts. That they occur less often than one\nmight expect is the result of a certain fluidity in all processes of individual\nidentification. ~1992: 59!\nThe problem of dual loyalty should not be a great problem since individ-\nual identification is fluid, and often individuals and groups can sort out\nthe moral challenge of dual loyalty without its becoming too serious a\nproblem or challenge to state solidarity. Nevertheless, it would appear\nthat the fear of dual loyalty is real and that in the short term, at least, it is\neasy for significant segments of the majority population to turn to easy\nbut false generalizations, often racist, that contextualize the accusation\nof dual loyalty.\nHowever, could dual loyalty function simply as a descriptive term\nand not as an ominous accusation? I am unconvinced that dual loyalty\ncan disassociate itself from the perception that the state demands uncon-\nditional loyalty and any moral obligations that challenge this loyalty are\na challenge to the state. Nevertheless, assuming for a moment that it is\npossible to recognize the term to have a purely descriptive usage, dual\nloyalty might simply be a basic feature of modern life. For example, in\nthe wake of Kosovo declaring its independence from Serbia on February\n17, 2008, the Serbian diaspora reacted by condemning the independence\ndeclaration. In Canada, there were protests by Serbian-Canadians in Van-\ncouver, Edmonton, Calgary, Montreal, Toronto and Ottawa. At the Toronto\nrally, protestors condemned the American government\u2019s recognition of\nKosovo as an independent state and demanded that the Canadian govern-\nment not recognize Kosovo. The protestors suggested that recognizing\nKosovo would be against international law, but also that \u201cit could have\nramifications on this country\u2019s unity\u201d ~Thomas, 2008!. Drawing a con-\nnection with Quebec separatists, the Serbian-Canadian protestors held\nplacards stating \u201cKosovo\u0002Quebec.\u201d In this instance, the protestors sug-\ngested that as good Canadians they could not support Kosovo\u2019s indepen-\ndence. There is no dual loyalty here since what exists is simply a minority\nconstituency stating a political argument. Indeed, I am not sure that dual\nloyalty as a descriptive concept carries much weight\u2014people always have\nmultiple loyalties. The term\u2019s power is in its discriminatory implications.\nThe Problem of Dual Loyalty 1039\nIt is obviously true that people will have multiple and overlapping\nloyalties that may come into conflict at some point during their lives. Con-\nsequently, it may be worth asking why dual loyalty is treated as anything\nother than the usual conflict of commitments that characterize politics.\nDual loyalty is clearly a problem about commitment, and commitment is,\nas Judith Shklar points out, a complex concept that relates to politics, law,\nphilosophy and morality. However, as Socrates suggested, being a good\ncitizen involves uncovering hidden contradictions, and consequently, it\nmakes little sense to presume that political life and moral values will not\ncome into contradiction at some point ~Arendt, 2005!.\nConclusion\nImmigrant communities are particularly vulnerable to accusations of dual\nloyalty, since they are often perceived to\ndestroy the isomorphism between people, sovereign and citizenry. Immigrants\nare perceived as foreigners to the community of shared loyalty towards the\nstate and shared rights guaranteed by the state. Trans-national migrants pre-\nsumably remain loyal to another state whose citizens they are and to whose\nsovereign they belong, as long as they are not absorbed into the national body\nthrough assimilation and naturalization. ~Wimmer and Schiller, 2002: 309!\nYet no state is homogenous and there are always minority populations.\nTo presume that an absence of minorities is a prerequisite to stability\nand unity is empirically unfounded and morally questionable. Further-\nmore, it is mistaken to think that only minorities will be susceptible to\ndual loyalty. Having a shared history does not mean that a population\nwill join together and stay together, regardless of whether they are a minor-\nity ~Clifford, 1994!. Why a minority cannot be counted on but a member\nof the majority can is blatantly fallacious. Everyone is susceptible to a\ncrisis of conscience, or a difficult decision to face. Moral quandaries are\nthe stuff of human existence.\nFurthermore, it is worth recalling that the modern project of the\nnation-state with its idea of a homogenous population may serve to dic-\ntate much contemporary political discourse, but it is also contingent on a\nspecific political project. However, this project and the \u201cdiscovery\u201d of\nthe uniform nation-state at Westphalia were fictions and were known to\nbe so at the time.\nThis was a fiction of the early modern theorists, as Hugo Grotius exposed in\nhis survey of the diversity of existing constitutions, designed to ensure in theory\nthe consolidation of early modern states that they wished to promote in prac-\ntice. Leibniz replied to Hobbes and Pufendorf in 1677 that no known political\nsociety exhibited the cultural and institutional uniformity that they took for\n1040 ILAN ZVI BARON\ngranted.... But these voices, barely heard today, were drowned out by the ascen-\ndancy of uniformity. ~Tully, 1995: 83!\nIn other words, the suggestion that uniformity is necessary for state sta-\nbility was an argument rendered for political purposes and which suc-\nceeded due to an assumption that diversity was a cause of war.\nWhile this kind of logic suggests that dual loyalty is a serious prob-\nlem, it does not have to be. Some historical perspective might be in order\nhere. For example, during the presidential election, John F. Kennedy suc-\nceeded in overcoming the perception that being a Catholic might mean\nthat his loyalty to the United States would be in tension with his loyalty\nto the Vatican. Moreover, many countries allow their citizens to carry dual\ncitizenship. Indeed, since the latter half of the twentieth century it has\nbecome increasingly common for states to allow dual citizenship.4 The\ndual citizenship phenomenon most likely is allowed since the state does\nnot consider it to threaten the state\u2019s ability to demand the loyalty of its\ncitizens. Moreover, the chance of an individual being a citizen of two coun-\ntries that are at war with each other is low, although the chance of their\nhaving foreign policy conflicts is high. Often, such conflicts will matter\nlittle. Dual citizens of the UK and Canada, for example, probably will not\nfind themselves morally torn because of debates in economic trade talks\nand any such differences would hardly be referred as a case of dual loyalty.\nDual loyalty functions as a political term when it is tied to discrim-\nination, fear, and often racism, such as when liberal societies start accus-\ning minorities of having dual loyalties. Often those accused will be\ntargeted because they do not conform in some way to whatever the nation\nis presumed to be. Yet dual and indeed multiple loyalties are quite com-\nmon and they rarely pose much of a threat. Many of us have multiple\npolitical loyalties that come into conflict. That this kind of discourse\nbecomes a discriminatory accusative one is dubious. What is required in\nresponse to such accusations is a deeper engagement with our inherent\npluralism, to what Fred Halliday refers to here as internationalist:\nThe internationalist tradition may have chalked up many illusions; most polit-\nical traditions do. But, faced as we are with the complacency of national pride\nand the automatic loyalty claimed by the nation-state, the ever-recurrent waves\nof nationalism and the grip of institutions associated with it, an element of\ninternationalist intransigence, intellectual and moral, may well be in order.\n~1988: 198!\nThere are many normative challenges involved in the dual loyalty\ndiscourse, challenges that are not by themselves new, but are surely worth\nreflecting upon seriously, as religion, immigration and diaspora relations\nbecome increasingly important for modern politics and international rela-\ntions. Contemporary politics should be based on discourses that recog-\nThe Problem of Dual Loyalty 1041\nnize pluralism to be a fait accompli, to recognize change and for migrants\nand hosts to respect the diversity of populations. This is easier said than\ndone, but I suggest that future debates and government policies relating\nto identity, security and the insidious nature of the dual loyalty discourse\ntake into account that homogeneity is not a security solution, and dual,\nand indeed multiple, loyalties are the norm. It may even be possible for\nminority groups who view each with suspicion to at least empathize with\neach other\u2019s experience as minorities.\nNotes\n1 The literature on political obligation is vast, but two good advanced introductions\nare, Klosko, 2005; Simmons, 1980.\n2 It is worth pointing out here that while it is common to view the United States as a\nChristian country, the United States Constitution does not privilege any religion and\nstates that all established religions shall be respected. As it is written in the First\nAmendment: \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,\nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\u201d\n3 In an interview with David Twersky, current Senior Advisor to the Executive Direc-\ntor for Policy, International Affairs and Communication at the American Jewish Con-\ngress, Twersky mentions how at the time there was some anxiety about the Pollard\nAffair becoming a dual loyalty issue. The issue of dual loyalty, however, emerged\nprimarily in debates within Jewish communities, and of whether or not to get involved\neither on behalf of Pollard or against him. He recalls heated debate at the time on\nhaving loyalties to both Israel and the United States, but in the end the general deci-\nsion was not to get involved. Interview conducted by the author in New York City,\nSeptember 2, 2008.\n4 This change may provide an indication that the modern-nation state is coming to\nterms with the inherent diversity of its population, although it does not demonstrate\nthat states are less concerned about dual loyalty problems. It is telling that it is often\nillegal for anyone of dual citizenship to enter into a country in which they are a\ncitizen using their other passport.\nReferences\nAggestam, Lisbeth and Christopher Hill. 2008. \u201cThe Challenge of Multiculturalism in\nEuropean Foreign Policy.\u201d International Affairs 84 ~1!: 97\u2013114.\nAnthias, Floya. 1998. \u201cEvaluating \u2018Diaspora\u2019: Beyond Ethnicity?\u201d Sociology 32 ~3!: 557\u201380.\nArendt, Hannah. 1986.
