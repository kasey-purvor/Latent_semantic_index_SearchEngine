Quantum cascade\nlasers, however, rely on intersubband transitions, effectively\nnegating effects resulting from the detrimental indirect bandgap\n[1]. Intersubband transitions in Si\/SiGe heterostructures have\nsmall energy gaps, resulting in emission in the mid- and\nfar-infrared (terahertz) part of the electromagnetic spectrum\n[2]\u2013[4]. Recently, there has also been considerable interest in\nusing impurity dopants in silicon such as boron and phospho-\nrus, since it was demonstrated that such materials can show\nelectroluminescent emission in the terahertz region of the elec-\ntromagnetic spectrum [5]\u2013[9].\nWith the emergence of several potential applications, sources\nthat emit terahertz radiation have also recently become a \u201chot\u201d\nresearch topic. These include medical imaging [10] (including\ndental and skin cancer), biological weapons detection [11], ex-\nplosives detection [12], gas sensing, pollution monitoring, and\nmolecular spectroscopy [13].\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section II deals with some\nof the issues particularly pertinent to growth in a strained mate-\nrial system such as Si\/SiGe. This is one of the main constraining\nfactors in the design of Si\/SiGe active regions. Section III cov-\ners resonant tunneling in p-type Si\/SiGe. Resonant tunneling\nthrough the barriers separating subsequent quantum wells in a\nquantum cascade active region controls the transport of carriers\nacross the heterostructure. The amount of carriers that can travel\nthrough the active region has a direct effect on the gain. Sec-\ntion IV covers electroluminescence measurements at terahertz\nfrequencies from Si\/SiGe cascade structures. The amount of\ngain in any laser depends on the lifetimes of the upper and lower\nlaser levels. In Section V, lifetime measurements performed on\nSi\/SiGe quantum wells are discussed. Another important aspect\nregarding gain is how much of the optical mode overlaps with the\nactive region. Conventional semiconductor lasers have exploited\nthe refractive index step between epitaxial layers with different\natomic mole fractions to achieve a high mode overlap in the ver-\ntical (growth) direction. In contrast, at terahertz frequencies, it is\nnecessary to exploit surface-plasmon-enhanced guiding in order\nto achieve the same effect. Section VI explores the possibility\nof using buried silicide layers to obtain a high mode overlap\nin the vertical direction. Electroluminescence measurements in\nSi\/SiGe quantum cascade structures so far have exhibited wide\n(>10 meV) intersubband emission peaks. Narrow peaks in the\nemission spectrum of some samples have been attributed to\ndopant impurities such as boron and phosphorus. Section VII\ndiscusses whether these impurities transitions might themselves\n1077-260X\/$20.00 \u00a9 2006 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

MATERIAL GROWTH ISSUES\nWhile a III\u2013V terahertz quantum cascade laser has already\nbeen demonstrated [1], a silicon-based quantum cascade laser is\nyet to be realized. This has a lot to do with inherent difficulties of\nthe less mature strained Si\/SiGe growth system, the chemistry\nof dopant materials, and the band structure of the system [14].\nAll Si\/SiGe quantum cascade emitter designs produced to date\nhave been p-type using holes as the unipolar carriers. This is\ndue to the large effective mass for electrons tunneling in the\ngrowth direction of Si (1 0 0) being 0.94 me, where me is the\nfree electron mass [14]. This would result in the requirement\nof subnanometer tunnel barriers to allow significant tunneling\nthrough potential barriers. Also, most n-type dopants surface\nsegregate, making the doping of the thin n-type layers difficult\nwithout doping layers grown after the As or P has been released\nin the growth chamber.\nTypically the critical thickness at which dislocations occur is\nseveral orders of magnitude smaller than the necessary thickness\nof a quantum cascade active region and strain symmetrization is\nrequired [14]. The thickness and mole fractions of each succes-\nsive SiGe epilayer are carefully adjusted so that each epilayer\nunder compressive strain has neighboring epilayers under ten-\nsile strain, so that the average strain across the entire structure\nis zero. Strain does not have to be balanced over each individ-\nual pair of compressive and tensile layers but must be balanced\nover a distance less than the critical thickness. Therefore, typ-\nically the strain is balanced over a cascade period. To date we\nhave demonstrated the growth of over 4 \u00b5m of quantum cascade\nactive region that has been perfectly strain balanced. A good\nexample of this is shown in Fig. 1. This figure shows a trans-\nmission electron micrograph (TEM) of few of both the top and\nbottom epilayers of a 600-period, 4-\u00b5m-thick, quantum well\nstack grown by gas source molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on\na relaxed Si0.8Ge0.2 virtual substrate. By comparing the thick-\nnesses of the epilayers in both the left- and the right-hand TEM\npictures it is easy to see that the layers are uniform after 4 \u00b5m\nof growth. This is a necessary condition for the active region of\na real quantum cascade laser.\nIII. RESONANT TUNNELING IN P-TYPE SiGe\nThe principle of the quantum cascade relies heavily on the\nbasic quantum mechanical principle of tunneling, i.e., a particle\nFig. 2. Current versus voltage for three different RTD devices with different\nareas. Current peak corresponds to the tunneling between the contacts and the\nHH2 states in the quantum well.\nmay tunnel through a finite potential energy barrier even though\nit may not classically have enough energy to otherwise surmount\nthe barrier. Resonant tunneling occurs when two energy states on\neither side of a potential energy barrier have the same energy.\nResonant tunneling in a quantum cascade laser controls the\ntransport of carriers across the heterostructure, and therefore\nhas a direct effect on the gain. Significant understanding of the\ntunneling processes can be obtained from two tunnel barriers\nwith a single quantum well sandwiched in between. Such a\ndevice is called a resonant tunneling diode (RTD).\nThere are many reports of Si\/SiGe RTDs in the literature\nespecially p-type grown pseudomorphically on bulk silicon\nsubstrates [15], but relatively few reports on high-quality\nstrain-relaxed buffers [16], [17]. In particular, there are very\nfew examples of strain symmetrized p-type RTDs with energy\nlevel separations at terahertz frequencies. A number of wafers\nwere grown to gain an understanding of tunneling of holes in\nSi\/SiGe structures with the same composition and barriers as\ndesigns for terahertz cascades, and the results from one wafer\nare presented here. The epitaxial layer structure consisted\nof a 4-nm i-Si0.6Ge0.4 quantum well sandwiched between\n4-nm i-Si barriers. Either side of the Si barriers had 11 nm of\ngraded i-SixGe1\u2212x leading to an Si0.8Ge0.2 ohmic contact layer\ndoped at a concentration greater than 1019 cm\u22123. The entire\nstructure just described was grown on top of a Si0.8Ge0.2 virtual\nsubstrate. Mesas were etched using SiCl4 reactive ion etching\nand Al (1% Si) evaporated to form shallow ohmic contacts. A\nrapid thermal anneal below 400 \u25e6C was performed to prevent\nspiking of the contacts. A thick SiOx layer was used to isolate\nthe top and bottom contacts before a via hole was used to\ncontact the top ohmic contact of the device. Fig. 2 shows typical\ncurrent\u2013voltage curves for the three mesa sizes processed from\na single wafer. In each case, a large nonlinearity is observed at\naround 0.5 V indicating resonant tunneling between the ohmic\ncontacts and the heavy-hole 2 (HH2) state in the quantum well.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

TERAHERTZ ELECTROLUMINESCENCE\nFROM SiGe CASCADES\nThe first demonstration of intersubband electroluminescence\nfrom a Si\/SiGe cascade structure was at midinfrared frequen-\ncies. It exploited an HH-to-HH intersubband transition [2] using\npseudomorphically grown SiGe quantum wells on a bulk sili-\ncon substrate. The disadvantage of the pseudomorphic growth\nis that only a small number of quantum wells may be grown,\nup to a metastable critical thickness [14], which is too small to\nachieve sufficient active cascade periods for large enough gain\nfor a laser. The first demonstration of terahertz electrolumines-\ncence from a Si\/SiGe strain symmetrized structure was reported\nin [3]. This electroluminescent emission, however, resulted from\napplying electric fields along the quantum well of modulation-\ndoped p-type Si\/SiGe quantum wells, thereby heating holes to\nhigher states, and emitting photons when the excited holes were\nrelaxed to the ground state. The first demonstration of terahertz\nelectroluminescence from a real Si\/SiGe quantum cascade struc-\nture was demonstrated by a subset of the authors of this paper [3].\nThis structure contained 30 active periods consisting of a quan-\ntum well and a barrier arranged in a so-called quantum staircase\nstructure. It is difficult, however, to attain the population inver-\nsion required to produce a laser in this type of structure. This is\nbecause the tunneling rate controlling carrier injection into the\nupper energy level will be nominally the same as the tunneling\nrate controlling the depopulation of the lower energy into the\nnext adjacent well. More recently, however, the same authors\ndemonstrated terahertz electroluminescence from a 100-period\ninterwell, or diagonal structure [4]. It is easier to obtain popula-\ntion inversion in this type of structure, since the tunneling rates\ncan now be tuned by altering the electric field across the struc-\nture. This type of structure also has the added advantage that the\ntransition energies can be tuned with the applied electric field.\nFigs. 3 and 4 show the experimentally measured (dashed line)\nand theoretically calculated (solid line) TE- and TM-polarized\nedge emission spectrum at 4.2 K, respectively. The theoretical\ncalculations were performed using a six-band k \u00b7 p model with\nself-consistent inclusion of the internal charge density. Exact\nFig. 4. TM-polarized edge emission spectrum taken under an applied bias of\n6.4 V (10% duty cycle) at 4.2 K (dashed line) and theoretical predictions (solid\nline). The features marked 1, 2, and 4 are the well-known p3\/2 series of Si:B.\ndetails of these calculations are published elsewhere [18]. Fig. 3\n(TE) shows one well-defined spectral feature centered on 8 meV,\nattributed to the lowest energy HH to light-hole (LH) interwell\ntransition, HH1-LH1. It is very difficult to completely rule out\nthermal origins for this feature (black body). However, since\nHH-LH or LH-HH transitions allow TE-polarized intersubband\nradiative transitions, while for HH-HH, LH-LH, or electron-to-\nelectron radiative intersubband transitions only TM polarization\ncan be observed at small k-parallel, it should be possible to ob-\nserve a discernible difference between the two spectra. This is\nindeed the case. In the TM spectrum shown in Fig. 4, the 8-meV\nfeature is strongly suppressed while an additional feature be-\ntween 20 and 30 meV is clearly observed. This feature is not\npresent in the TE spectrum and is identified as the degenerate\nLH1-LH1 and HH1-HH1 interwell transition. Between 30 and\n40 meV, three sharp features are observed labeled 1, 2, and 4.\nThese correspond to the well known p3\/2 series of Si:B [19],\n[20]. The considerable differences between Figs. 3 and 4 along\nwith their good agreement with theoretical predictions provide\nstrong evidence that these features do indeed result from inter-\nsubband transitions. Further evidence can be found in [4], where\nthe frequency shift of these peaks with applied bias is discussed.\nThe best theoretical fits to the experimental emission spectra\nrequire population inversion to be present in the calculations.\nIn contrast, there is poor agreement between experimental and\ntheoretical spectra if thermal equilibrium populations are used.\nThe theoretical modeling therefore suggests that population in-\nversion is obtained in these samples although there is no exper-\nimental proof to confirm this prediction.\nV. INTERSUBBAND LIFETIME MEASUREMENTS\nIn order to produce gain in a potential laser material, it is\nnecessary to achieve population inversion. This typically hap-\npens when the upper and lower states in the radiative transition\nhave different lifetimes, specifically when the upper laser level\nhas a long lifetime, and the lower laser level has a short life-\ntime.

Full details\nof the band structure and experimental details can be found else-\nwhere [21], [22]. Fig. 5 shows the differential probe transmission\nagainst optical delay for three temperatures between 4.2 and 300\nK. From this measurement, it is observed that lifetimes as long\nas 25 ps persist for temperatures up to 300 K. More importantly,\nthis measurement shows that the lifetime remains relatively con-\nstant over this large temperature range due to the lack of polar\noptical phonon scattering in Group IV materials [18]. The inter-\nsubband lifetimes decrease as the energy is increased toward the\nGe\u2013Ge optical phonon energy as this mechanism becomes the\ndominant nonradiative process. This is in stark contrast to what\noccurs in the III\u2013V material system. Here, the lifetime rapidly\ncollapses to subpicosecond values above 40 K due to polar op-\ntical phonon scattering. This provides strong evidence that any\nsuccessful Si\/SiGe quantum cascade laser operating below the\noptical phonon energy has the potential to operate over a wider\ntemperature range than its III\u2013V counterparts.\nOnce the pump energy is increased to larger values, the inter-\nsubband lifetime rapidly collapses below the resolution limit of\nFig. 7. Plot of intersubband lifetime for an intrawell LH1-to-HH1 transition\nagainst both energy (bottom axis) and wavelength (top axis).

Fig. 6 shows the differen-\ntial probe transmission at 32.9 meV, comparable to the Ge\u2013Ge\noptical phonon energy of 37 meV. This is entirely expected,\nsince as the Ge\u2013Ge phonon energy is approached, carriers relax\nto the ground state by the nonradiative optical phonon scatter-\ning mechanism. The situation is summarized in Fig. 7, which\nshows the intrawell LH1-to-HH1 intersubband lifetime plotted\nagainst energy. The lifetimes can be observed to decrease with\nincreasing energy, and at 30 meV are limited by the measure-\nment resolution of the pump-probe technique. The Ge\u2013Ge and\nSi\u2013Si phonon energies are highlighted for clarification.\nVI. BURIED SILICIDE WAVEGUIDES\nRealizing an active region that exhibits large material gain is\nof course like winning only half the battle. If the electric field of\nthe propagating electromagnetic mode cannot interact with the\nmaterial, then no laser can be produced. The magnitude of this\ninteraction is described by the modal overlap. In conventional\nvisible and near infrared semiconductor lasers, this is achieved\nby engineering a large refractive index step around the active\nregion in order to tightly confine the electromagnetic mode.\nUnfortunately, as the wavelength gets longer it becomes pro-\ngressively harder to engineer a significant refractive index step.\nOne of the key enabling technologies in the development of the\nIII\u2013V terahertz quantum cascade laser was the introduction of\nsurface plasmon waveguides [1]. Surface plasmon waves form\nat the interface between metallic and dielectric media. In the\ncase of the III\u2013V cascade laser, sandwiching the active region\nbetween the top Au-doped semiconductor ohmic contact and a\nbottom highly doped semiconductor layer forms a double plas-\nmon waveguide. For the bottom doped-semiconductor layer to\nbecome a reflector, the doping of the layer must be made suffi-\nciently high to result in a negative dielectric constant. As higher\ndoping will result in a better reflector but also will increase the\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on May 26, 2009 at 10:46 from IEEE Xplore.

This means that the con-\nductivity is also much lower. Unfortunately, a high conductivity\nis required for the imaginary part of the dielectric constant to\nbecome larger than the real part. This is necessary for a neg-\native dielectric constant and a good reflector. For this reason,\na heavily doped Si or SiGe layer will not act as a good plas-\nmon reflector unlike n+ GaAs in the III\u2013V laser. Assuming\na 4-\u00b5m-thick SiGe active region sandwiched between a top\nAl-p++-SiGe ohmic contact and a bottom contact layer with\na realistic doping density of 3\u00d7 1020 cm\u22123, it is possible to\ncalculate the mode overlap as a function of bottom contact layer\nthickness (Fig. 8) [23]. This is a reasonable approximation of\nthe quantum cascade structures that have been grown, fabri-\ncated, and characterized to date with active regions of up to\n4-\u00b5m thickness on top of \u223c3.5-\u00b5m virtual substrates. Fig. 8\nshows that this configuration provides a waveguide with very\npoor modal overlap, with a best case scenario of between 10%\nand 20% overlap at 4.8 THz.\nThe situation can be dramatically improved if advantage is\ntaken of a technology that is only available in the Si (and SiGe)\nmaterial system, i.e., replacing the bottom doped-contact layer\nwith a buried silicide layer. The silicide layer has the advantage\nof having a much higher electrical conductivity than a semi-\nconductor, and typically within one order of magnitude of good\nmetals. A full description of the fabrication of a buried silicide\nlayer can be found elsewhere [24]. The four most mature sili-\ncide technologies are WSi2, CoSi2, TiSi2, and NiSi. So far, we\nhave concentrated on WSi2 because the low-resistivity phase is\nstable to temperatures over 800 \u25e6C allowing Si and SiGe hetero-\nlayer growth after a silicide has been formed. Fig. 9 shows the\nmode overlap for a 4-\u00b5m-thick SiGe active region, sandwiched\nbetween a top Al-p++-SiGe ohmic contact and a bottom WSi2\ncontact layer, as a function of silicide thickness [23].

Using a\nburied silicide of thickness 0.3 \u00b5m or larger, the overlap is now\napproximately 95% at 4.8 THz.\nFig. 10 shows the calculated waveguide losses as a function\nof active region thickness for WSi2. Again it is assumed that\nthe active region is sandwiched between a top Al-p++-SiGe\nohmic contact and a bottom WSi2 contact layer. Once the active\nregion thickness becomes larger than 4 \u00b5m, the losses become\nquite small and certainly comparable to the waveguide losses\nand modal overlaps quoted in terahertz GaAs quantum cascade\nlasers [1].\nFig. 11 shows a TEM of a wafer we have grown with a buried\nWSi2 layer wafer [24] to produce high modal overlap.

IMPURITY-BASED TERAHERTZ ELECTROLUMINESCENCE\nIn Section IV, it was noted that between 30 and 40 meV three\nsharp features are observed in both the TE-polarized (Fig. 3) and\nthe TM-polarized (Fig. 4) electroluminescence spectra. These\ntransitions were attributed to the well known p3\/2 series of\nSi:B [19], [20]. The conventional wisdom has been that these\ntransitions are excited by impact ionization, though recent work\n(to be published) has shown that thermal effects may play a\nmore important role. Under certain bias conditions and at the\nlowest temperatures in some structures, the intersubband tran-\nsition can be suppressed and the terahertz electroluminescence\narises purely from the impurity transitions [5], [9].\nThe possibly of harnessing these transitions to make an\nimpurity-based laser has generated considerable excitement\nover the past few years. The first of these impurity-based lasers\nwas demonstrated in 2002 [25]. A pulsed CO2 pump laser was\nused to excite electrons high into the conduction band. These\nelectrons rapidly relax into the upper 2p0 lasing state via inter-\nvalley acoustic and optical phonon scattering. The long lifetime\nof the 2p0 state causes a relaxation bottleneck, and leads to a\npopulation inversion. Stimulated emission on the 2p0 \u2192 1s(T2)\ntransition at 22.4 meV (5.41 THz) then occurs [26]. A sim-\nilar mechanism was exploited in bismuth-doped silicon [27]\n(Si:Bi). Here, lasing transitions occur between the upper 2p\u00b1\nlevel and the closely spaced 1s(E) and 1s(T2) lower levels.\nThis results in two emission lines at 23.76 meV (5.74 THz)\nand 25.49 meV (6.16 THz). Lasing emission was also observed\nfrom similar 2p\u00b1 \u2192 1s(E) and 2p\u00b1 \u2192 1s(T2) transitions in\narsenic-doped silicon (Si:As) [28]. This time the emission lines\nwere at 24.94 meV (6.03 THz) and 26.33 meV (6.36 THz).\nAntimony-doped silicon (Si:Sb) was also shown to exhibit las-\ning [29]. One laser emission line at 24.07 meV (5.15 THz from\nthe 2p0 \u2192 1s(T2) transition is observed.\nTherefore, an obvious question is: Can such impurity transi-\ntions be used to produce an electrically pumped laser? Fig. 12\nshows two terahertz electroluminescence spectra for a sample\ncontaining boron and another containing phosphorus. All elec-\nFig. 12. Terahertz electroluminescence spectra for two samples. (a) Sample\ncontaining boron. (b) Sample containing phosphorus.\ntroluminescence measurements so far suggested that the ap-\npearance of these transitions in the electroluminescence spectra\nwas highly dependent on the temperature of holes in the de-\nvice. This hole temperature in turn was dependent on both the\nheat-sink temperature (i.e., the temperature of the cold finger\nof the cryostat) and on the amount of current flowing through\nthe particular device. In the case of a biased device, if sufficient\ncurrent is flowing, then it can contribute to an additional rise in\ntemperature through joule heating.\nIn order to properly assess the effect of temperature on the\nimpurity transitions, it is necessary to consider a passive device\nwith no current flowing. In the simplest case, this can be achieved\nby considering the effect of temperature on the absorption prop-\nerties of a moderately doped bulk silicon wafer (1015 \u2212 1016\ncm\u22123). Fig. 13 shows the absorption from a boron-doped silicon\nwafer with temperature at terahertz frequencies (2.4\u201314.4 THz).\nAt very low heat sink temperatures, three very sharp absorption\nfeatures can be observed between 30 and 40 meV. These corre-\nspond to the lines 1, 2, and 4 of the well known p3\/2 series of\nSi(B) [19], [20]. As the heat sink temperature is raised between\n4.2 and 90 K, the transitions become progressively weaker, until\nthey are finally extinguished around 100 K [9]. This corresponds\nclosely with a reduction in the total absorption up to 100 K. In\ncontrast, the behavior of the phosphorus-doped sample in Fig. 14\nis quite different. Unlike the boron-doped sample, the maximum\nabsorption of the phosphorus-doped sample is not at 4.2 K, but\nat 50 K. Close examination of Fig. 14 reveals that the absorp-\ntion spectrum is dominated by three features in the range 30\u201345\nmeV at 4.2 K. These correspond to the 2p0, 2p\u00b1, and 3p\u00b1 Ly-\nman series transitions to the ground state 1s(A1) [20]. As the\nheat sink temperature is increased, a further set of thermally\nactivated absorption lines appear between 20 and 30 meV. By\nconsidering the binding energies in [19], it is possible to show\nthat these transitions are between the 2p0, 2p\u00b1 energy levels\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

These features reach max-\nimum transition strength at 50 K. It is from these additional\nthermally activated transitions that emission was observed in\nFig. 12. Above 50 K, the strength of all the transitions begins to\nweaken until they are extinguished at around 100 K.\nTo summarize, the measured temperature dependence of these\ntransitions shows that the most optimistic operating range of an\nimpurity-based laser is 4.2 K \u2264 T \u2264 90 K. This represents an\nideal passive device with no current flowing. In a real device with\ncurrent flowing and associated joule heating, the actual operating\nrange is likely to be much narrower and it is unlikely such a\ndevice would have a maximum operating temperature above\n40 K as in Fig. 12. This is quite consistent with the value quoted\nin [27]. The major problem with such impurity devices is the\ntradeoff between doping, current, gain, and free carrier losses.\nInitial estimates of the gain for electrically pumped impurity\nstructures suggest that it is going to be difficult to overcome the\nwaveguide losses with simple device structures.\nVIII. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have discussed several aspects pertinent to\nthe realization of an electrically pumped silicon-based terahertz\nlaser. Growth in a strained material system such as Si\/SiGe has\nbeen discussed. It has been shown that it is possible to grow\na low dislocation density, thick multiperiod Si\/SiGe superlat-\ntice, with good layer thickness uniformity. Quantum mechanical\ntunneling between valance band states in p-type Si\/SiGe RTD\nstructures has been demonstrated, which is a prerequisite for\nthe operation of a p-type Si\/SiGe quantum cascade laser. Life-\ntime measurements in quantum wells with an energy spacing\nat terahertz frequencies have also been performed. These mea-\nsurements show that the lifetime remains relatively constant\nover a large temperature range and provides strong evidence\nthat a successful SiGe quantum cascade laser has the poten-\ntial for operation over a wider temperature range than its III\u2013V\ncounterpart. The question of high vertical confinement in silicon\nhas been addressed and it has been shown that buried silicide\ntechnology provides a possible route forward. Modeling sug-\ngests that modal overlap and waveguide losses comparable to\nGaAs terahertz quantum cascade lasers can be produced. Fi-\nnally, the possibility of exploiting impurities such as boron and\nphosphorus to realize an electrically pumped terahertz silicon-\nbased laser has been explored. Absorption measurements show\nthat it is unlikely such an impurity-based device would have a\nmaximum operating temperature above 40 K. The impressive\nresults from optically pumped Si-impurity lasers demonstrate\nthat lasers can be produced with these impurities although the\nadditional free carrier losses from higher doping levels required\nto reduce resistive joule heating and increase gain make the\nrealization of an electrically pumped silicon-impurity laser far\nmore difficult than the optically pumped version.\nIn summary, all the necessary individual components to real-\nize a terahertz quantum cascade laser are in place. The challenge,\nwhich remains, is to design and grow a quantum cascade active\nregion that exhibits sufficient gain to provide lasing action.\nREFERENCES\n[1] R. Kohler, A. Tredicucci, F. Beltram, H.
