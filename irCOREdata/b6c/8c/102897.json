INTRODUCTION\nThe enviable physical properties of amorphous hydroge-\nnated carbon (a-C:H), e.g., low friction coefficient and high\nhardness, make these films useful material for mechanical\napplications. Electronic doping of a-C:H films has often\nbeen discussed. Meyerson and Smith1\u20133 deduced from their\nexperimental results that doping of amorphous hydrogenated\ncarbon is possible. Since then, there has been significant sci-\nentific interest in the electrical and optical properties of ni-\ntrogenated amorphous carbon films.4 The synthesis of the\nsuperhard compound b-C3N4 is another aspect, not dis-\ncussed in this article, that has motivated research.5\nAmir and Kalish6 and Schwan et al.7 found that nitroge-\nnation of a-C:H leads to a \u2018\u2018graphitization\u2019\u2019 of amorphous\nhydrogenated carbon when deposited with a standard plasma\nenhanced chemical vapor deposition ~PECVD! system. They\nquestioned if true electronic doping in PECVD deposited\na-C:H was occurring or even possible. Recently, a highly\nsp3 bonded form of a-C ~highly tetrahedral amorphous car-\nbon, ta-C! has been deposited by filtered cathodic vacuum\nare ~FCVA!.8 They9,10 found that these films can be doped\ncontrollably by N and found that the Fermi level of ta-C\nfilms can be moved throughout the band gap. Conversely,\nRonning et al.11 and Hofsa\u00a8ss and Ronning12 didn\u2019t find dop-\ning effects in their mass selected ion beam deposited ~MSIB!\nta-C ~although they did not deposit both C and N simulta-\nneously but more as a multilayer structure!.\na!Author to whom correspondence should be addressed; present address:\nSAP AG, LOG.DEV.03, Neurott Str. 16, 69190 Walldorf, Germany.2070021-8979\/98\/84(4)\/2071\/11\/$15.00\nloaded 11 Oct 2010 to 131.227.178.158. Redistribution subject to AIP lWeiler et al.13 reported that it is possible to deposit\namorphous hydrogenated carbon films with high sp3 ~75%!\nand H contents ~27%!, and stated14 that it is possible to dope\nthe ta-C:H films deposited using the plasma beam source\n~PBS!. However, it should be noted that ta-C films15 as well\nas a-C films deposited by PBS14 possess defect densities as\nhigh as 131020 defects\/cm3. These high defect densities un-\nderline the difficulties involved in electronically doping these\nfilms.\nIn this work, thin a-C:H films have been deposited by a\nhighly ionized plasma beam using a mixture of acetylene and\nargon as the working gases. By varying the energy of both\nthe acetylene and the argon ions it is possible to minimize\nthe hydrogen content in the films down to 2.5 at. %. Mea-\nsurements of the optical gap of the nonnitrogenated films\nreveal two maxima at about 100 and 200 eV ion energy.\nOther film properties such as stress, electrical conductivity,\ndefect density as determined by electron spin resonance\n~ESR or EPR! are also presented. We show that two distinct\nprocesses occur in PBS deposition if a gas mixture of argon\nand acetylene is used as the working gases. Knock on pro-\ncesses of carbon atoms at the surface by Ar1 ions of the\nplasma beam can be observed in addition to impacts of the\nacetylene ions. Films have been deposited by varying the ion\nenergy and the acetylene to argon ratio of the working gas\nmixture. The argon ion bombardment at ion energies of\nabout 100 eV is responsible for a dramatic decrease in the\nhydrogen content down to 2\u20133 at. %. This decrease is ac-\ncompanied by an increase in the energy gap.\nFurther, we study the properties of nitrogenated a-C:H\nfilms deposited using the PBS system.

EXPERIMENT\nThe PBS apparatus is similar to that used by Weiler\net al.13 in which the structure of the a-C:H film is controlled\nsolely by ions. A radio frequency ~rf! power of 30 W at\n13.56 MHz is applied via a capacitor and matching network\nbetween the ground electrode and the powered electrode.\nThe pumping speed was 1800 l s given by a turbomolecular\npump. The pressure in the plasma chamber remained below\n131024 mbar during deposition. For the experiments with-\nout nitrogen two different acetylene\/argon ratios of 3 and 6\nhave been used. For those experiments the ion energy was\nvaried between 80 and 250 eV. Ion energy and ion current\ndensity have been measured by a Faraday cup using a retard-\ning field probe. Measured ion current densities in our experi-\nments showed a slight variation with the ion energy from\n0.13 to 0.2 mA\/cm2. The energy spread of the ion beam was\nfound to be DE\/E,0.1. The background pressure before\neach deposition was less than 131027 mbar. Crystalline\nsilicon and quartz glass substrates have been used and placed\nin a large copper holder for the deposition. The substrate\ntemperature during deposition was measured to be below\n50 \u00b0C. For the deposition of nitrogenated a-C:H films the\nC2H2 , Ar, and N2 flows are given in Table I. The ion energy\nused for the deposition of the a-C:H:N films is fixed at 105\neV.\nThe defect density has been determined by electron para-\nmagnetic resonance. A microwave frequency of about 9.3\nGHz and a magnetic field of 3400 Gauss was used with a\nmodulation amplitude of 1 Gauss. The microwave power\nwas below 35 mW in order to avoid saturation effects. Con-\nductivity corrections have also been performed to achieve\ncorrect defect density values. The total number of defects in\nthe a-C:H films were determined by comparison to a diphe-\nnylpicrylhydrazyl ~DPPH! standard. Measurements of the\nelectrical conductivity were made on a temperature regulated\nvacuum stand that allows variation between 200 and 600 K.\nThe films were also characterised using FTIR, Raman,\nphoto thermal deflection ~PDS!, luminescence spectroscopy,\nand temperature dependent electrical conductivity.

This has been performed for each nec-\nessary pair of contacts and for the possible magnetic field\ndirections. The influence of the contact areas have been cor-\nrected by the method of Chwang, Smith, and Crowell.17 For\neach film at least five mobility measurements have been per-\nformed with each measurement being averaged over 10 000\nseparate voltage\/current pairs. The magnetic field during the\nmeasurement was 61.4 T. Polycrystalline diamond films\nwith different B contents were also measured on the same\napparatus and found to give the expected Hall mobility and\ncoefficient values.18\nFurther, the elemental composition has been obtained by\nmeasuring the N content by RBS and using the\n15N(p ,ag)12C reaction. The H content has been determined\nby the 15N method.\nIII. RESULTS\nA. Deposition of a-C:H in an Ar\/C2H2 atmosphere\nThe plasma and the produced ion beam used for the\ndeposition is examined first. The operation with pure acety-\nlene revealed results similar to previous studies in terms of\nenergy distribution and ion current on a PBS.13 Surprisingly,\nthe PBS produces ions with roughly the same energy regard-\nless of whether argon or acetylene, or a mixture of both\ngases, are used. Argon content was measured by Rutherford\nbackscattering. In all the films examined the argon content is\nfound to be constant at approximately 4 at. %. This was veri-\nfied by electron-energy-loss spectrostopy ~EELS! analysis.\nDue to the inertness of argon these atoms are unlikely to be\nbe bonded, and must be interstitially trapped. Hydrogen con-\ntent of the deposited films is shown in Fig. 1 as a function of\nion energy, which is equal for both ion species Ar1 and\nC2H2\n1\n. The open circles and the filled boxes represent\nAr\/C2H2 ratios of 6 and 3, respectively. Compared to the\nPBS deposited films of Weiler et al.,13 who determined\nabout 25 at. % hydrogen in their films without simultaneous\nargon bombardment, the H content lies roughly at half their\nvalue ~12 at. %! at an ion energy of 200 eV. At lower ener-\ngies than 200 eV the hydrogen content increases at first, but\nFIG. 1.

The\nextreme low hydrogen content was not found when deposit-\ning at the same ion energies using pure acetylene, where 24\nat. % was measured similar to those obtained by Weiler. The\nshift in the minimum in hydrogen content for the higher\nAr\/Acetylene ratio being at a lower energy ~90 eV, shown in\nFig. 1! must be related to processes initiated by the argon\nions. These films have also been additionally characterized\nby Fourier transform infrared ~FTlR! absorption spectros-\ncopy. Spectra have been obtained in the range of\n400\u2013 4000 cm21. Infrared C\u2013H vibrations from 2850 to\n3100 cm21 were observed. Dischler, Bubenzer, and Koidl19\nassigned individual absorption peaks for a-C:H films ~Table\nII!. The 3300 cm21 peak ascribed to \u2014CwC\u2014 was not ob-\nserved. The formation of sp1 bonded carbon is unlikely us-\ning the plasma beam source. The obtained spectra have been\nfitted with five Gaussians allowing all parameters to vary\nexcept the positions which were held in intervals of 5 cm21\naround those assigned by Dischler ~Table II!. The sixth ab-\nsorption that has been assigned at 3045 cm21 was not con-\nsidered because the intensity of the absorption of wave-\nlengths over 3000 cm21 was too low to separate two lines.\nThe observed lines are C\u2013H bonding, therefore the spectra\nprovides only information on the hydrogen bonding to car-\nbon and not pure C\u2013C bonds. Tamor and Wu20 found that\ntheir a-C:H films contained large amounts of unprotonated\nsp2-bonds which are not visible to infrared spectroscopy.\nHydrogen seems to preferentially bond to sp3 coordinated\ncarbon. Measurements of Grill and Patel21 support this idea.\nTherefore, the analysis of intrared ~lR! data to obtain the\nsp3\/sp2 ratio of the films is strictly speaking, not suitable. In\naddition, a quantitative analysis would contain an error due\nto different oscillator strengths of the lines. Nevertheless, if\nequal oscillator strengths are assumed, the proportion of the\nsp3 hybridized lines stays nearly constant at 75% of the total\nabsorption.\nThe sp3 content for an Ar\/C2H2 ratio of 3:1 as deter-\nmined by K edge EELS spectroscopy is presented in Fig. 2.\nThe sp3 content shows a small maximum at 200 eV. The\naverage coordination number of the films is shown in Fig. 3\nand shows two maxima at about 100 eV ~which belongs to\nthe very low hydrogen content due to the Ar bombardment!\nand a maximum at 200 eV. To get more information on the\nhydrogen bonding in the films thermal desorption mass spec-\ntroscopy ~TDMS! was performed. For this purpose the films\nTABLE II.

Redistribution subject to AIP lhave been heated up to 1120 K using a heating rate of 20\nK\/min. Mainly H2 and CH4 were found. These molecules are\nthe most probable forms in which hydrogen can desorp from\nthe surface ~assuming that most molecules desorb directly\nfrom the surface!. Radical or ionic species will desorb with a\nlower probability from the surface because of their higher\nreactivity. More complex hydrocarbons may also desorb\nfrom the surface, but are also less probable since a larger\nnumber of surface bonds will need to be broken. We also\nfind CH3 and CH2 in our mass spectra, but these findings are\ndue to cracking patterns of the CH4 molecules ~see Fig. 4!.\nThe Ar desorption from the a-C:H film starts earlier than the\nH2 or CH4 desorption. There is a low step at 650 K and a\nlarger step at around 850 K. The reason for this behavior is\nthe chemical inertness of the Ar atoms. They do not bond to\nthe film, so that as soon as there is an enhanced probability\nfor the Ar to diffuse through the carbon film, the effusion of\nthe Ar will take place. This leads to the assumption that\nstructural changes are made to the a-C:H film at tempera-\ntures of about 850 K. The effusion of hydrogen starts at a\ntemperature of 870 K and reaches a maximum at 970 K for\nall a-C:H films. Principally the hydrogen may exist in the\nfilm as unbonded H2 , CH4 molecules, at inner surfaces of\nthe carbon film ~voids! or single bonded hydrogen in the\nFIG. 2. sp3\/sp2 content of plasma beam deposited a-C:H films with work-\ning gas mixture containing both acetylene and argon.

Appl. Phys., Vol. 84, No. 4, 15 August 1998 Schwan et al.\nDowncarbon film ~thus mainly CH groups should exist and less\nCH3 groups or CH2 groups!.\nWe do not expect a large amount of unbonded hydrogen\nto exist in the films due to the small atomic diameter of a\nhydrogen molecule ~1.8 \u00c5!. Since the atomic diameter of Ar\nis 2 \u00c5, it would be expected that the desorption of hydrogen\nshould start at lower temperatures than the Ar due to diffu-\nsion processes. From our measurement this can not be con-\ncluded, for unbonded hydrocarbons. The formation of hydro-\ncarbons is less likely than the formation of hydrogen\nmolecules. This means that the hydrogen is likely only to be\nbonded in small amounts as unbonded hydrocarbons in the\na-C:H film due to the low atomic hydrogen content. If the\nhydrogen is bonded at inner surfaces the hydrogen diffusion\nshould be increased if unsaturated carbon sites exist in the\nneighbourhood. The density of those dangling bonds was\nmeasured and amounts to 1020 dangling bonds\/cm3 (51\n31024 \u00c53). The effusion of the hydrogen starts at about\n870 K leading to the assumption that in the deposited a-C:H\nfilms only small voids can exist. Otherwise, effusion should\nstart at lower temperatures since the dangling bond density is\nso large. This leads to the assumption that the hydrogen\nshould mainly be bonded to the a-C:H film in the form of\nC\u2013Hx bonds.\nThe explanations given also fit the desorption mecha-\nnism of methane. The effusion of methan starts at the same\ntemperature as the effusion of hydrogen. The cracking of\nbonds at the surface of the film leads to the fact that H2 and\nCH4 are created at the surface. The energy needed to break a\nC\u2013H bond amounts EC\u2013H54.5 eV.22 The energy needed to\nbreak a CH3 group from the surface amounts EC\u2013CH353 eV.\nIf we assume that the formation energy of H2 and CH4 can\nbe compared the energy difference DE5DEC\u2013CH3\n2DEC\u2013H51.5 eV, showing that the formation of methane\nshould be more probable than the formation of hydrogen.\nThis also means that as long CH3 groups exist at the surface\nthe effusion of methane is more likely.\nThe stress values of the a-C:H films is shown in Fig. 5\nas a function of the ion energy. For both flux series two\nmaxima are revealed at about 100 and 200 eV, also suggest-\ning that two different growth processes occur as a function of\nion energy.

The second maxi-\nmum at 100 eV ion energy reveals higher stress values of 11\nGPa and a optical gap E04 of 2.5 eV. The maximum at lower\nenergy can not be found with pure acetylene. Therefore, it\nmust be initiated by the Ar ions. Schwan et al.23 have found\na maximum density in a-C films for the knock-on subplan-\ntation by Ar bombardment at about 100 eV which is similar\nto the peak value of stress found in the study. As in the case\nof Schwan et al.23 the optimum densification of the a-C:H\nfilms deposited by a Ar\/C2H2 working gas was found to vary\nwith the ratio of Ar1 ions to neutral carbon atoms. It is likely\nto assume that the incoming Ar1 ions may lead to analogous\nprocesses regardless of deposition environment. The plasma\nbeam source provides therefore a chance to compare the di-\nrect subplantation process with the knock-on process.\nThe loss of hydrogen at ion energies around 100 eV is\naccompanied by a maximum in stress, but is not related to\nany major change in infrared absorption. One possible pro-\ncess that explains these measurements could be a stress in-\nduced elimination of hydrogen. The internal stress can be\nassumed as due to disorder in the lattice due to bond mis-\nmatch. For a single atom the binding energy is diminished by\nthe mismatch, so the strength of bond is weakened by the\namount of local disorder energy. The internal stress corre-\nsponds to an average disorder energy per C-atom. If this\ndisorder energy is high enough, as indicated by the stress\nexceeding a threshold, a change in bond configuration could\ngain energy and therefore become possible. Pompe et al.24\nand McKenzie et al.8 developed the idea of such a phase\ntransition for the formation of large amounts of sp3 bonds\nwhen stress values above a threshold are present: McKenzie\net al.8 gives a threshold of 1.46 GPa while Schwan et al.23\nfound a transition above 14 GPa Beside sp3 C\u2013C and sp2\nC\u2013C bonds, there are C\u2013H bonds in hydrogenated films too.\nAssuming that the stress would invoke a transition at local\nsites in the films, stress values above a threshold at 10\u201312\nGPa, according to the observed data, could force neighboring\nC\u2013H bonds to be eliminated by forming C\u2013C and H\u2013H\nbonds.\nThe existence of aromatic structures was predicted in\nearlier theories of the structure of a-C:H ~Ref. 25! due bond\nenergy savings over simple aliphatic ~olefinic! bonding. Re-\ncently, Robertson26 showed that the disorder energy of ion\nbeam deposited carbon\u2014being in the order of 0.3 eV in\namorphous carbon\u2014could exceed the energy gain of fusing\nof three pairs of p electrons to a benzene like ring. Aromatic\nstructures gain energetic preference because of the overlap of\nwave functions for p orbitals delocalizes the participating\nelectrons. If an ion impact during deposition displaces one of\nthe ring atoms, the delocalization of the p electrons is dis-\nrupted and the energy gain is lost. So the region becoming\nnonaromatic is far larger than the initial displacement. There-\nfore, intense ion bombardment could provide an explanation\nfor the absence of aromatic bonds. This would lead to the\nobserved infrared spectrum with extremely low aromatic car-\nbon absorption lines and provides an explanation for the highloaded 11 Oct 2010 to 131.227.178.158.

ESR measurements revealed electron spin den-\nsities between 631019 and 1.431020 cm23.\nThere is a slight dependence of spin density on hydrogen\ncontent, where the highest spin density was found at the\nlowest hydrogen content. This leads to the assumption that\nthe structure of the PBS deposited carbon films is different to\nPECVD films. Most carbon films with low hydrogen content\nhave spin densities above 1020 cm23.20,27,28 Hydrogen can\nreduce the spin density of carbon films down to 1018 cm23.27\nOn the other hand reducing the hydrogen content should lead\nto an increased spin density. Taking the dramatic reduction\nin the hydrogen content in these films a sharply increased\nnumber of defects should be obtained in the films deposited\nat an ion energy of 100 eV. Electrical conductivity at room\ntemperature ~297 K! varied over three decades between 5\n31027 and 131024V21 cm21 revealing two maxima at\n100 eV and near 200 eV @see Fig. 6~b!#. For amorphous\ncarbon films two possible processes are suggested as the\ndominant current conduction mechanism, first, a thermally\nactivated process where the conductivity s(T) depends on\nexp(2kT)21 or second, a variable range hopping process\nnear the Fermi level EF where there is a exp(kT)21\/4 depen-\ndence on s(T).29 Conductivity vs reciprocal temperature\nstudies were used to obtain the activation energy Ea of the\nfilms @Fig. 6~c!#. If it is assumed that thermally activated\nelectronic conduction occurs, then s(T)5s0 exp(2Ea\/kT)\nprovides the activation energy Ea with the values shown in\nFig 6~c! obtained to a linear fit in the range 270\u2013300 \u00b0C.\nThe data reveal two maxima at 100 and 200 eV correspond-\ning to that found for the energy gap. The activation energy is\nan average energy that an electron needs to participate in the\nconduction process. A change in the activation energy is\nlikely to be either accompanied by a change in the optical\ngap or a movement of the Fermi level. In the current system,\nfor undoped PBS a-C films, since the activation energy\nchange is small it is likely that the variation observed in the\nrange 0.2\u20130.3 eV is due to carrier activation from the va-\nlence band to the p-type structured defect present in the a-C\nnetwork which has been reported both experimentally30 and\ntheoretically.31 The conduction process in a-C will have a\nstrong dependence on the structure of the film. This is illus-\ntrated by the fact that the conductivity at room temperature\nof the deposited films varies over two decades despite Ea\nbeing apparently constant. To get more information on the\nconduction process and thereby the electronic density of\nstates nitrogen is added as a fed gas.\nB. Doped a-C:H films\nThe a-C:N:H films have been deposited at 100 eV ion\nenergy at an Ar\/C2H2 ratio of three. The composition of the\na-C:H:~N! films is shown in Fig. 7. With addition of nitro-\ngen into the deposition chamber, the hydrogen content in the\nfilms increases from 3 at. % ~without N! to 18 at. % ~with N!\nand then decreases very slightly for higher nitrogen fluxes.\nThe N content in the films rise from about 0 at. % to about 8\nat. % at a nitrogen flow of 0.75 sccm. This is slightly differ-\nent to findings of Silva et al.32 The reason for this might be\nthat in our case the stress plays a role for the hydrogen in-icense or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/about\/rights_and_permissions\n2076 J. Appl. Phys., Vol. 84, No. 4, 15 August 1998 Schwan et al.\nDowncorporation in the a-C:H films. As soon as the nitrogen is\nadded the stress in the film decreases below the 10\u201312 GPa\nbenchmark and the hydrogen content increases to about 20\nat. %. For films with increasing nitrogen content the hydro-\ngen content decreases slightly as observed by Silva et al.32\nThe IR absorption coefficient of the infrared active\nNvCvN and CwN modes are shown in Fig. 8, together\nwith the IR absorption coefficients of the N\u2013H and C\u2013H\nmodes. The C2H2 molecules in the plasma dissociate when\nthey impinge on the film surface. As a consequence, hydro-\ngen is released from the C2H2 bonds to the nitrogen because\nthe NH bonding energy ~3.7 eV! is higher than the CH bond-\ning energy ~3.5 eV!. This explains the observed IR absorp-\ntion coefficients for the increase in the NH bonds and the\ndecrease in the CH bonds. The IR absorption coefficient for\nthe wave numbers between 1000 and 1700 cm21 increases\nstrongly especially with the highest N incorporation ~Fig. 9!.\nA comparison of our IR data to our Raman measurements for\nthe a-C:H:~N! films reveal that the increase in the IR absorp-\ntion coefficient in this wave number region cannot be ex-\nplained purely by breaking of the symmetry of the Raman\nactive E2G2 mode as Kaufman, Metin, and Saperstein\nFIG. 7.

Redistribution subject to AIP ldiscussed.33 Our measurements show that the \u2018\u2018G peak\u2019\u2019 of\nthe Raman data and our G peak of the IR data have differ-\nences in wave numbers up to 60 cm21. Further, the Raman\n\u2018\u2018D peak\u2019\u2019 and IR D peak differ significantly from each\nother. We explain the strong increase in the IR absorption\ncoefficient in the region between 1000 and 1700 cm21 by IR\nactive C\u2013N and CvN bonds each contributing to the IR\nactivity in that wave number region.\nThe E04 gap vs the nitrogen flow is shown in Fig. 10.\nSurprisingly, the optical gap shows a maximum of 2.7 eV at\na N2 flow of 0.5 sccm. This result is in contradiction to\nfindings by other groups concerning a-C:H deposited by\nPECVD.6,7 In PECVD deposited a-C:H, nitrogen incorpora-\ntion leads to a strong decrease in the optical gap because the\naromatic regions in the a-C:H:N films grow in size with\nincreasing N incorporation. For the a-C:H:N films deposited\nby the PBS at an ion energy of 105 eV, the optical gap first\nincreases and then decreases only at higher N2 flows beyond\n0.5 sccm. Silva et al.32,34\u201337 saw a similar result in their mag-\nnetically enhanced plasma deposited a-C:H:N films.\nFor carbon films deposited by the PBS with concurrent\nAr bombardment it is possible that the model of\nRobertson1,12 based on aromatic clusters needs to be ex-\ntended in such a manner that the role played by the defects\nalso needs to be incorporated. The Urbach energy vs N2 flow\nis presented in Fig. 11. It is observed that the Urbach slope\nremains nearly constant at 270 meV upto a N2 flow of 0.6\nFIG. 9. IR absorption coefficient in the range 1000\u2013 1700 cm21.\nFIG. 10. E04 gap in dependence of the N2 flow.icense or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/about\/rights_and_permissions\n2077J. Appl. Phys., Vol. 84, No. 4, 15 August 1998 Schwan et al.\nDownsccm which is a typical value for a-C and a-C:H films. This\nhigh Urbach energy is consistent with the high defect density\nof 1020 defects\/cm3 and also points to the fact that the optical\nproperties may be determined by defect states in the band\ngap. The Urbach energy becoming larger and close to 350\nmeV beyond a N2 flow of 0.6 sccm is consistent with the\nwidening of the tail states giving rise to the decrease in the\noptical band gap.\nAnother interesting feature that might give information\nabout the structure is the luminescence properties of the\na-C:H films.8,9,32 In Fig. 12 the position of the luminescence\npeak is shown vs the N2 flow. Rusli, Amaratunga, and\nRobertson38 proposed that electron hole pairs are strongly\nlocalized after photogeneration. Thus the excitation and re-\ncombination of electron hole pairs are believed to occur in p\nbonded clusters, as prooved by experimental evidence. Since\nwe use an excitation energy of 2.54 eV, it is possible that the\nluminescence is dominated by excitation to the tail states.\nThis may be the reason why the luminescence peak energy\nremains approximately constant at 2 eV. It is worth noting\nthat many forms of a-C films with N incorporation give rise\nto a PL peak energy of about 2 eV. It is possible that this\nenergy is a fundamental property of the C\u2013N bond and is\nobserved due to the formation of a carbon\u2013nitrogen alloy\nwith its own unique signature.\nFIG. 11.

Both the optical gap and electrical conductivity\nincrease simultaneously for low N incorporation. This is dif-\nferent to nitrogenated a-C:H films deposited by conventional\nPECVD. This fact will be discussed in more detail, but it has\nto be noted that the structure of a-C:H films deposited by the\nPBS is different to a-C:H films deposited by PECVD. In Fig.\n14 the electrical conductivity vs Tauc gap for a-C:H:~N!\nfilms is presented for films deposited by PBS and PECVD.7\nHere, the difference of the physical behavior of the a-C:H:N\nfilms deposited by the different methods can be observed\nmore clearly.\nTemperature dependent electrical conductivity results\nshow that the electrical conduction is thermally activated,\nwith activation energies ~vs N2 flow! shown in Fig. 15. We\nobserve approximately linearly decreasing activation ener-\ngies from 0.27 eV ~0 sccm N2! down to 0.18 eV ~1 sccm N2!.\nThis indicates only a slight movement of the Fermi level\nthrough the gap while other properties vary significantly. The\ndefect density is of the order of 131020 defects\/cm3 ~Fig.\n16! and decreases slightly with increase in N2 content. This\nvariation is not large and is expected by the small movement\nin the Fermi level in a-Si, a defect density of 1018 defects\/\nFIG. 13.

The defect density observed has a value comparable to\na-C and a-C:H films deposited by other techniques. It is\ninteresting to consider where the defects are located in the\nband gap. First consider the case where all defects are lo-\ncated at the Fermi level ~60.1 eV! in the middle of the band\ngap ~Davis\u2013Mott model!. This would mean the density of\nstates ~DOS! at the Fermi level would be in the range of 1021\n(eV!21cm23. But if this were correct for a-C:H films, the\nelectrical conductivity of the films should be much higher.\nThis is not observed, so that the DOS of a-C and a-C:H\nmust be a combination of the Cohen\u2013Fritzsche\u2013Oshivinsky\n~CFO! model and the Davis\u2013Mott model where the defects\nare distributed between tail states appended to extended\nstates as well as at the middle of the band gap, as shown by\nSilva and Amaratunga37 for a-C:H films.\nThe half width of the ESR signal is approximately 2 G\nindicating that exchange narrowing does occur ~H content is\nbelow 20 at. % and consequently does not influence the ESR\nwidth!. The low value of the ESR half width indicates that\nthe exchange frequency must be high which is indicative that\nthe electrons are not strongly localized. The ESR findings are\nsupported by PDS measurements. PDS shows that the optical\nabsorption coefficient decreases only slightly below\n104 cm21 for photon energies below 2 eV ~Fig. 17!.

Redistribution subject to AIP lonly be explained if the DOS in the gap diminish slightly at\nthe valence band edge. Otherwise, there would be a strong\ndecrease in the absorption coefficient as in the case of a-Si:H\nhaving an Urbach energy of the order of 50 meV. Here, in\nthe case of a-C:H:N, the Urbach energy remains nearly con-\nstant for all N2 flows at a value of 250 meV, which is com-\nparable to values normally observed in the literature.34\nThe mobility of the charge carriers ~which are assumed\nto be electrons for the nitrogenated samples! is presented in\nFig. 18 as determined by Hall measurements. Prior to these\nmeasurements, Hall measurements were conducted on B-\ndoped polycrystalline diamond films prepared by CVD.18\nBoth the mobility and carrier type obtained were in agree-\nment to other published literature. In the case of undoped\na-C:H:N films a Hall mobility could not be measured. There\nis a strong increase in the mobility with N2 flow reaching a\nmaximum value of about 10 cm2\/Vs at a nitrogen flow of\n0.75 sccm.

The mobility of the doped car-\nbon films gives results comparable to the best a-Si:H films.\nOriginal data is presented due to the surprisingly high mo-\nbility calculated.\nThe behavior of the mobility may be explained if the\nenvironment at which the electrons are located changes to be\naromatic ring structures or conjugated carbon chains which\ngrow in size and as a consequence become more delocalized\nas the nitrogen content increases.7 As a consequence it is\npossible that the mobility of the electrons increase. Accord-\ning to the Robertson model, the optical gap is inversely re-\nlated to to the aromatic cluster size39 and therefore a collapse\nin the optical gap for high N contents is expected. This is not\nobserved in our results. So the possibility is that large con-\njugated carbon chains delocalize the electron distribution.\nThe conjugated carbon chains and to a lesser degree aromatic\nbondings may be the reason why the electrical behaviour of\na-C:H is so completely different compared to a-Si:H ~high\nelectrical mobility and high defect density are not possible in\na-Si:H!. The increase, and, not decrease, in the optical gap\nwith N2 flows up to 0.3 sccm lends further proof that our\nfilms do not follow the Robertson model. This may be due to\nthe large number of defect states in the gap partly determin-\ning the optical and electrical properties of a-C films and a\nsignificant proportion of conjugated carbon being present.\nFIG. 19. ~a!

DISCUSSION\nThe a-C:H films deposited by the PBS show a large\noptical gap ~above 2 eV! compared to a-C:H films deposited\nby PECVD although having only a slightly higher sp3 con-\ntent ~about 30%!. Raman investigation of undoped a-C:H\nfilms grown by the PBS show only a small D peak at\n1350 cm21 ~Fig. 20!. We will briefly discuss two possibili-\nties which may explain the observed data. The first possibil-\nity would be if there exist a small number of extended (aro-\nmatic) ring structures in the PBS deposited a-C:H. This\nmeans that the aromatic p bonds only have a minor contri-\nbution to the DOS in the undoped films and the majority of p\nbonds are olefinic in nature. In the case of the nitrogenated\na-C:H films the intensity ratio of the D peak\/G peak ~Fig.\n20! is higher and the G linewidth is smaller than in the case\nof nonnitrogenated films. This shows that some aromatic\nrings are formed in the films due to nitrogenation.7 It is pro-\nposed that Robertson\u2019s model39 on the dependence of the\nband gap on the aromatic cluster size should be modified to\nincorporate defect states ~about 1020 defects\/cm3 in our\nfilms! which are situated at the p and p* band tails in the\nmobility gap as well as close to the Fermi level. The defect\nstates may contribute significantly to the Urbach tail and\nconsequently to the optical gap and electrical mobility gap,\nespecially in a-C:H films deposited by techniques such as\nPBS where there is a low aromatic content ~even though\nsmall percentage of clustering will be introduced with nitro-\ngenation!. In most PECVD deposited a-C:H it should be\nnoted that the paromatic states make a strong contribution to\nthe DOS and so the effect of decreasing the defect density in\nthe gap may not play a significant role in the size of the band\ngap. This is clearly seen by increasing the N content in the\nPECVD deposited a-C:H where the band gap of the films\ntends to zero eV due to the increase in the aromatic ring\ncluster sizes6,7 although the defect density is decreased by\ntwo orders of magnitude.\nFIG. 20.

Phys., Vol. 84, No. 4, 15 August 1998 Schwan et al.\nDownIn the case of the PBS deposited nitrogenated a-C:H\nfilms no such decrease in the band gap is observed. Only an\nincrease in the gap and a decrease in the ESR density is\nobserved. These results point to the fact that the influence of\naromatic clusters in the PBS deposited films is minimal with\nincreasing N content. Some defect passivation in the tail\nstates may be taking place and giving rise on the increase in\nthe optical gap. Therefore, unlike conventional PECVD de-\nposited films where the aromatic ring cluster sizes control the\noptical gap of the deposited a-C:H films, in the PBS films it\nis the defect states in the gap that control the optical gap and\nnot the aromatic ring clusters.\nAnother possibility to explain the observed data would\nbe if the sp3 content increases with increasing N content.\nThe nitrogen could act in this case as a weak donor. The\nhigher the donor density the higher the electrical conductiv-\nity. We did not observe a decrease in the electrical conduc-\ntivity followed by an increase as in the case of a compen-\nsated semiconductor in which the nitrogen is a donor.32 The\nC2H2 gas may contain upto 0.5% N2 due to the industrial\nprocess in the forming of the gas. This means that all our\na-C:H films may contain small amounts of nitrogen. As a\nresult we may not find that the conduction first decreases\nwith increasing nitrogen content, as the p-type structural de-\nfect may already have been compensated for in the DOS.\nAccording to Robertson,39 sp2 configurated aromatic\nclusters or defects as found in PBS deposited nitrogenated\na-C:H films ~Raman! although not significant in controlling\nthe optical band gap, gives rise to a subband gap of about 0.6\neV. These subband gap states associated with the p and p*\nbands obtained using a tight binding model were experimen-\ntally observed by Silva and Amaratunga37 using a space\ncharge limited current analysis. According to the DOS pro-\nposed by Silva and Amaratunga, defect states give rise to\nlocalized gap states situated at the middle of the band gap for\nundoped a-C:H films with p and p* bands situated 60.3 eV\nfrom this intrinsic Fermi level in accordance to the Davis\nMott model for the DOS in an amorphous material.\nThe activation energy shown in Fig. 15 shows the ex-\npected 0.3 eV energy for undoped a-C:H. This could be a\nresult of carriers being thermally activated from the intrinsic\nFermi level at mid gap to either of the p or p* appended\nstates situated 60.3 eV from the Fermi level. If we now\nassume that some of the incorporated N in our films create a\np* N state, situated below the p* C state,36 then it is ex-\npected that some localized defects in the a-C:H will be pas-\nsivated by the addition of N and an additional n-type dopant\nstate is created as a mixed C\u2013N p* state.35 Therefore, any\nactivation energies measured now will result in thermal ac-\ntivation of carriers from the Fermi level to the mixed C\u2013N\nalloy p* conduction band. As shown in Fig. 15, values of\nless than 0.3 eV are recorded up to a minimum of 0.17 eV.\nHall measurements give carrier mobilities that are compa-\nrable to good a-Si:H films40 with values as high as\n10 cm2\/Vs which indicate extended carrier conduction as op-\nposed to hopping conduction in these films. Emin41 proposed\na Hall mobility model based on polaron hopping. In this\nmodel the carriers transfer between adjacent sites. The Hall\neffect results from the interference between different pathsloaded 11 Oct 2010 to 131.227.178.158. Redistribution subject to AIP lbetween the initial and final state and involves at least three\nsites. The sign of the Hall coefficient depends on the number\nof such sites and on the sign of the transfer integral. If there\nis an odd number of interconnecting sites and they are con-\nnected by anti-bonding orbitals, the sign of the Hall coeffi-\ncient is positive, but bonding or lone pair orbitals give a\nnegative Hall effect. In our case it is impossible to determine\nthe Hall mobility sign for high doping levels. The model\nrequires hopping between nearest neighbour atoms, to pre-\nserve the correlation between the wavefunctions and to cause\ninterference effects in the transfer integrals. Such a model\nwould apply to a narrow band gap material or when the\nmobility edge is at the center of the band,40 which is the case\nfor our films. It should be noted that the observed doping\neffect is very inefficient32 and in addition to the creation of a\nmixed C\u2013N p* state, the nitrogen may also encourage the\ncreation of aromatic clusters as observed in the Raman re-\nsults. The weak doping effect is further confirmed by the\nsmall decrease in ESR spin density with increasing N con-\ntent. This decrease in spin density may have resulted due to\nthe pairing up of defects in the creation of larger clusters of\naromatic rings.\nV. SUMMARY\nThe electronic properties of nitrogenated a-C:H films\ndeposited by the PBS at an ion energy of 105 eV using an\nAr\/C2H253 gas composition has been examined. Although\nsome of the results point to a weak doping effect, other re-\nsults are better explained by an increase of the aromatic clus-\nters in the a-C:H films. The initial increase in optical gap\ntaken together with the accompanied increase in electrical\nconductivity of two orders of magnitude argues for n-type\ndoping of a-C:H. The mobilty of the charge carriers in-\ncreases to 10 cm2\/V s at an N2 flow of 0.75 sccm. The Hall\nmobility of the charge carriers in PBS deposited a-C:H films\nseems to be based on polaron hopping.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was funded by the DFG Project No. Eh23\/\n29-1.
