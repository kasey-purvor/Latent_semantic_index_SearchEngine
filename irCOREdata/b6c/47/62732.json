Articulated brachiopods secrete a\ntwo- or three-layered calcite shell below an outer protein-\naceous periostracum. The primary layer is prismatic and\ngenerally has carbon and oxygen isotope ratios that are lower\nthan expected for equilibrium, whilst the secondary layer is\nfibrous or laminar and is thought to precipitate in isotopic\nequilibrium with ambient seawater (Lowenstam 1961; Brand\n1989; Grossman et al. 1991; Brand et al. 2003). The tertiary\nlayer, when present, is prismatic and locally confined inside\nthe shell. Vital effects are generally not recorded in the\nslow-growing secondary layer of brachiopod shells, though\nCarpenter & Lohmann (1995) found differences within individ-\nual specimens in the thin outer primary layer and in specialised\nareas of the secondary shell. Curry & Fallick (2002) recorded\ndifferent \u000218O values from the dorsal and ventral valves of a\nterebratulid species from the mouth of a narrow cave on the\nOtago Peninsula (New Zealand). Auclair et al. (2003) found\ndeviations of several per mil from expected equilibrium values\nin the outer part of the secondary layer of one punctate\nintertidal brachiopod shell. Very recently, Parkinson et al.\n(2005) have shown that \u000218O values from the fibrous secondary\nor prismatic tertiary shell layers of recent Terebratulida (in-\ncluding the same species already analysed by Curry & Fallick\n(2002) and Auclair et al. (2003) and Rhynchonellida species\nwere in oxygen isotopic equilibrium with ambient seawater\nand were relatively unaffected by shell specialisation. Also,\nParkinson et al. (2005) found no significant difference in \u000218O\ncompositions between ventral and dorsal valves. However,\ncarbon isotope composition can be highly variable and poss-\nibly subjected to a vital effect produced by metabolic prioriti-\nsation. Therefore it is the innermost and, when possible,\nnon-specialised secondary layer of fossil brachiopod shells\nwith similar ultrastructures to modern Terebratulida and\nRhynchonellida that should be sampled for stable isotope\nratios.\nThe isotope composition of carbon (\u000213C), oxygen (\u000218O)\nand strontium (87Sr\/86Sr) in ancient seawater has varied\nthrough time in response to palaeoenvironmental evolution.\nBrachiopods are among the best shells from which to obtain\nEarth and Environmental Science Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, 98, 1\u201318, 2008\n\u0003 2008 The Royal Society of Edinburgh. doi:10.1017\/S1755691008075634\nthe primary geochemical signal and environmental infor-\nmation. This present study assesses the degree of diagenetic\nalteration by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cathodolu-\nminescence (CL), and geochemistry from a suite of brachio-\npods from the Lower Permian Saiwan Formation, Interior\nOman. It then investigates the evolution of the Haushi sea, the\nbody of water in which the Saiwan Formation was deposited,\nusing O, C, and Sr isotopes of brachiopod shells collected bed\nby bed from the Saiwan Formation.\n1. Geological setting\nIn central Interior Oman, Lower Permian strata are repre-\nsented by the Al Khlata and Saiwan formations in surface\noutcrop (Fig. 1) and by the Al Khlata Formation and the\nlower and middle Gharif members in the subsurface. Corre-\nlation of these units, particularly the Saiwan Formation and\nthe lower Gharif member, has only recently been understood\nbased on brachiopod and palynomorph biozones (Angiolini\net al. 2006).\nThe surface Saiwan Formation was introduced by\nDubreuilh et al. (1992) for the marine fossiliferous sandy\nlimestones, previously informally named the Haushi limestone\nby Hudson & Sudbury (1959). The Saiwan Formation was\ndeposited in the Haushi sea, south of the Neotethys Ocean rift\nshoulder (Fig. 2), and overlies both the glacigene diamictite of\nthe Al Khlata Formation and the basal sandstones of Osterloff\net al. (2004). At its top, the Saiwan Formation is believed to be\nbounded by an unconformity, separating it from the overlying\ncontinental Gharif Formation sensu Dubreuilh et al. (1992).\nAngiolini et al. (2003a) showed the evolution of a pioneering\ncold-water brachiopod palaeocommunity (Pachycyrtella pal-\naeocommunity) at the base of the formation, followed by a\nmore mature secondary palaeocommunity of a more diversi-\nfied marine biota above. The Pachycyrtella palaeocommunity\nis characterised by: (1) a random distribution pattern over a\nlimited area; (2) clustering in groups; (3) numerical dominance\n(>85%) of P. omanensis; and (4) suspension feeding. Palaeo-\necological analyses (Angiolini et al. 2003a, 2006) suggested\nthat these brachiopods thrived on a mobile arenitic substrate at\nshallow depths around or just below the fair weather wave\nbase (10\u201320 m). The brachiopods also had rapid rates of\nreproduction and growth (r-strategy), reached maturity early\nand had high mortality rates in the juveniles (Angiolini et al.\n2003a). The disappearance of this basal palaeocommunity is\nrelated to a drastic change in the physical environment,\nrecording the interplay of final Gondwanan deglaciation and\ninitial Neotethys opening (Angiolini et al. 2003a). The second-\nary palaeocommunity rapidly reached high diversity, testifying\nto a significant climatic amelioration and more stable environ-\nmental conditions. Both the Pachycyrtella palaeocommunity\nand the overlying secondary palaeocommunity are dominated\nby large spire-bearing brachiopods, suggesting a high nutrient\nsetting (Perez-Huerta & Sheldon 2006). Eutrophic condition at\nthe base of the Saiwan Formation evolved upward into more\noligotrophic conditions.\nStephenson & Osterloff (2002) and Stephenson et al. (2005)\nstudied equivalent beds in the subsurface of South Oman. In\nthis region, the equivalent-aged rocks comprise clastic sand-\nstones of terrestrial origin, suggesting that the Haushi sea did\nnot transgress as far south as South Oman. However, the\npalynological succession allowed detailed metre-by-metre re-\nconstruction of vegetational changes within the deglaciation\nperiod. In the lowest part of the South Oman lower Gharif\nmember, a cold climate \u2018fern\u2019 wetland palaeocommunity was\npresent, probably on lowland outwash alluvial plains, whilst\non the surrounding uplands or better-drained ground, a primi-\ntive conifer community developed (Stephenson et al. 2005;\nStephenson & Osterloff 2002). Later in the postglacial period\nthese communities were replaced. In the lowland alluvial\nplains, a cycad-like and lycopsid vegetation developed, while in\nthe uplands or better drained areas a taeniate- and non-\ntaeniate bisaccate pollen producing glossopterid or other gym-\nnospermous flora was established. Slightly later, restricted\nmarine conditions occurred in parts of the sedimentary basin\nin South Oman. Within the bodies of brackish or salt water, an\nephemeral microflora and fauna (indicated by rare acritarchs\nand microforaminiferal linings) developed. Evidence from the\ncarbon isotope composition of bulk organic material from the\nAl Khlata and lower Gharif formations show a trend which is\nthought to reflect postglacial warming, since there is sedimen-\ntological and palaeontological evidence of deglaciation in the\nsequence (Stephenson et al. 2005).\nThe age of the limestones of the lower Gharif member, the\nsubsurface equivalent of the Saiwan Formation, was estab-\nlished in subsurface borehole core sections of Wafra-6 and\nHasirah-1 around 100 km to the west of the Saiwan Formation\noutcrop (Angiolini et al. 2006). Samples from two horizons\ncontained the fusulinids Pseudofusulina inobservabilis Leven,\nFigure 1 Geological sketch map of the Haushi surface outcrop area\nin central interior Oman, with location of the Saiwan type section\n(modified from Angiolini et al. 2003a).\n2 L.

This assemblage is similar to the\n\u2018Kalaktash complex\u2019 of Afghanistan, Central Pamir and\nKarakorum (Leven 1993, 1997; Gaetani et al. 1995), which is\nSakmarian based on species common to the standard Lower\nPermian stages of the Russian Urals. Fusulinids are currently\nthe most widely used biostratigraphic tools for correlating the\nbases of the Sakmarian and Artinskian stages in the Russian\nPlatform and Urals, thus the presence of the Pseudofusulina\nassemblage in the subsurface equivalent of the Saiwan\nFormation suggest a high level of certainty for the proposed\nSakmarian age.\n2. Material and methods\nThirty four articulated brachiopod specimens from the Pachy-\ncyrtella palaeocommunity (bed OL14 Fig. 3) and the overlying\nsecondary ecological palaeocommunities (beds OL15\u2013OL18\nFig. 3) of the Saiwan Formation were selected for ultrastruc-\ntural analysis. Of these, 31 underwent subsequent geochemical\nand isotope analyses and the data are shown in Table 1. The\nanalysed brachiopods belong to seven species of the orders\nProductida (Reedoconcha permixta), Orthotetida (Derbyia\nharoubi Angiolini et al. 1997), Spiriferida (Neospirifer (Quad-\nrospira) aff. hardmani (Foord, 1890)) and Spiriferinida (Pachy-\ncyrtella omanensis Angiolini, 2001, Pachycyrtella sp. A,\nPunctocyrtella spinosa Plodowski, 1968, Subansiria cf. ananti\nSingh, 1978). The systematic palaeontology of those brachio-\npods has already been published (Angiolini et al. 1997, 2003a;\nAngiolini 2001).\nThe specimens were embedded in resin, cut along longitudi-\nnal and transverse sections, then etched with 5% HCl for 20 s\nand metallic coated before being investigated using SEM to\ncheck the preservation of their shell fabric. In addition thin\nsections were made to allow cathodoluminescence microscopy\nalong the same sections.\nThe brachiopods were sampled for geochemical and isotope\nanalysis by drilling 6\u20138 mg along the longitudinal section of\neach shell using a diamond drill bit. The powder was split into\ntwo parts, one for geochemistry and Sr isotopes and the other\nfor C and O isotopes. Only the diagenetically unaltered inner\npart of the thick secondary shell layer of both the ventral and\ndorsal valves was sampled for geochemical and isotope analy-\nses (Table 1). Features such as the muscle attachment areas,\narticulation points, interareas and lophophore support were\navoided, although Parkinson et al. (2005) showed there is a\nminimal risk when sampling specialised shell fragments.\nGeochemical analyses were undertaken at the analytical\ngeochemistry laboratories at the British Geological Survey and\nthe Department of Geology, University of Leicester. Subsam-\nples for geochemical analysis at the British Geological Survey\nand for Sr isotope analysis were dissolved in ultra-pure acetic\nacid. The acetic acid leached fraction reserved for geochemis-\ntry (see below) was evaporated to dryness and the residue\ntaken up in 1% nitric acid. Geochemical data were obtained by\nInductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy\n(ICP-AES) on a Fison\/ARL 3580 simultaneous\/sequential\nspectrometer with Gilson auto sampler.\nAt the Department of Geology, University of Leicester, all\nthe samples were digested in acetic acid and analysed using a\nHoriba Jobin Yvon Ultima ICP Optical Emission Spec-\ntrometer. The sample digestion was often incomplete, and\nresidues composed of white, yellow or red material were found\nin some samples. A number of samples were analysed in both\nthe British Geological Survey and University of Leicester\nFigure 2 Palaeoenvironmental map of the Haushi sea transgression in interior Oman at Sakmarian times.\nModified after Konert et al. (2001).\nBRACHIOPOD CLIMATE PROXIES 3\n4 L. ANGIOLINI ET AL.\nlaboratories, and, given the partial dissolution that occurred\nfor some samples, the data are consistent between the two\nlaboratories. Although a direct one-to-one correlation is not\nobserved between the two data sets, the positive covariance\nbetween individual elements indicates that the data sets are\ncomparable and that any differences are the result of the\npartial dissolution and possible weighing errors, given the\nsmall sample sizes.\nApproximately 5 mg of the powdered carbonate was used\nfor the carbon and oxygen isotope analysis. The sample\nmaterial was reacted with anhydrous phosphoric acid in vacuo\novernight at a constant 25(C. The CO2 liberated was separ-\nated from water vapour under vacuum and collected for\nanalysis. Measurements were made on a VG Optima mass\nspectrometer. Overall analytical reproducibility for these\nsamples is normally better than 0\u00b71\u2030 for \u000213C and \u000218O.\nIsotope values (\u000213C, \u000218O) are reported as per mil (\u2030)\ndeviations of the isotopic ratios (13C\/12C, 18O\/16O) calculated\nto the VPDB scale using a within-run laboratory standard\ncalibrated against NBS standards.\nFor Sr isotope analysis, a subsample of w1\u20133 mg was\nweighed into a Savillex\u0003 FEP beaker and the carbonate\ndissolved in ultrapure 1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH). The acetic\nacid solutions were centrifuged and, if the geochemical analysis\nwas to be carried out at BGS, half of the solution retained for\nthis purpose. The remaining solution was evaporated to dry-\nness and the residue was taken up in 2\u00b75 M HCl. Strontium\nwas separated by conventional cation exchange techniques\nusing Biorad AG 50W-X8 ion exchange resin. Sr samples were\nloaded on rhenium (Re) filaments together with a tantalum\noxide (TaO) activator following the method of Birck (1986)\nand isotope ratios were measured on a Finnegan MAT Triton\noperated in static mode. Thirty analyses of the international\nstrontium isotope standard NBS 987 measured on the MAT\n262 during the period of study yielded a mean 87Sr\/86Sr ratio\nof 0\u00b7710249\u00040\u00b7000014 (2\u0003). Analyses on the Triton were\nmade at three separate times and the relevant mean values\nobtained for the NBS 987 international standard were\n0\u00b7710238\u00040\u00b70000071 (2\u0003 n=21), 0\u00b77102414\u00040\u00b70000062 (2\u0003\nn=11) and 0\u00b77102486\u00040\u00b70000088 (2\u0003 n=7). For consistency,\nall the measured ratios were normalised to the accepted value\nof 0\u00b7710248 for NBS 987. Replicate determinations (n=128)\nof the north Atlantic seawater standard yielded\n0\u00b77091752\u00040\u00b70000097 (2\u0003).\nUnless stated otherwise, the marine strontium isotope curve\nused to derive numerical ages is that of McArthur & Howarth\n(2004). The geochronological scale used here is that of Grad-\nstein et al. (2004).\n3 Analytical techniques to assess shell\npreservation\nTo assess shell preservation, three screening techniques have\nbeen used: ultrastructural analysis (SEM); cathodolumines-\ncence by a cold cathode luminoscope (Nuclide ELM2) operat-\ning at 10 KV voltage with a current beam of 5\u20137 MA; and\ndetermination of trace element contents.\nThe SEM study of the ultrastructure is a common technique\nto check the preservation of shell fabric. The classification\nof the shell ultrastructure has been carefully described by\nWilliams (1966, 1968, 1971), McKinnon (1974), and Williams\nin Williams et al. (1997). A recent paper by Samtleben et al.\n(2001) presents a classification of nine types of ultrastructure\nbased on a combination of biological fabric and diagenetically\naltered structures. For present purposes, a classification that\nenhance the types of pristine shell fabric is preferred, in order\nto distinguish the original features of the shell from subsequent\nchanges caused by diagenesis. Therefore, McKinnon (1974)\nand Williams in Williams et al. (1997) are followed for the\ndescription of the unaltered shell fabric, distinguishing speci-\nmens which show perfectly shaped or slightly imperfect and\namalgamated fibres of the secondary layer from those where\nthe secondary layer is laminar. When the shell fabric is\nobliterated by dissolution, amalgamation and recrystallisation\nthe specimens are considered as diagenetically altered.\nCathodoluminescence (CL) is a screening technique widely\nused to assess preservation of brachiopod shells (Popp et al.\n1986; Grossman et al. 1993), as they commonly show no\nluminescence in absence of significant geochemical alteration.\nHowever, its reliability to distinguish altered from unaltered\nshells has been questioned, as modern unaltered brachiopod\nshells can sometimes display orange-coloured luminescence\ntypical of altered carbonate, whereas some clearly altered fossil\nshells can, in fact, be non-luminescent (Korte et al. 2005).\nEngland et al. (2006) have recently shown that hyperspectral\nCL imaging can overcome the drawbacks of conventional\noptical CL and determine the real causes of luminescence.\nThey showed that the direct comparison of optical CL analyses\nis hampered by the fact that beam current conditions vary in\nthe different studies. To overcome this problem of comparison\nbetween the present data, all the samples were analysed\nwith the same instrument operating under the same beam\nconditions. Furthermore, CL was integrated with the other\ntwo screening techniques, cross-checking the results before\ndiscarding isotope analyses.\nThe third screening technique was the determination of\ntrace element contents of Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn and Sr in the calcite\nshell to assess if certain elements were in concentrations\nusually found in modern brachiopods. According to Brand\net al. (2003) well-preserved modern brachiopods from a variety\nof depositional environments display Sr contents of 450\u2013\n1928 ppm. Mn concentrations range from 1\u2013199 ppm with the\nmajority of specimens containing <80 ppm, and Fe contents\nare generally <140 ppm although values as high as 610 ppm\nwere observed. Popp et al. (1986) reported Sr contents as high\nas 3400 ppm and Mn of 250 ppm in non-luminescent portions\nof Palaeozoic brachiopod shells. However, the majority of\ntheir samples, which were mainly Carboniferous and Permian\nin age, displayed Sr and Mn concentrations within the range\nreported for modern brachiopods. Korte et al. (2003) adopted\nthe criteria of <250 ppm Mn and >400 ppm Sr for samples to\nbe classified as well preserved. Bruckschen et al. (1999) ac-\ncepted a more conservative cut-off limit of 200 ppm for Mn,\nwhich they considered to be a more reliable indicator of\nFigure 3 Stratigraphic log of the Saiwan Formation at the type section showing the stratigraphical position of\nthe analysed brachiopods and their O, C and Sr isotopic records. The solid symbols indicate all the values\nrecorded by pristine carbonates for each stratigraphic level (data highlighted in bold in Table 1); multiple\nsuperimposed solid symbols indicate that the isotope values from two or more specimens from the same\nstratigraphic level are identical. The solid line represents the average trend. The open symbols and the dotted line\nrepresent the data from four additional specimens (OM46-9, OL17-4, OL15-66, I5-4; data underlined in Table 1)\nwhich, despite showing a diagenetically altered and

L. ANGIOLINI ET AL.\ndiagenetic alteration than Sr content. High concentrations of\nboth Mn and Fe can result from surface coatings of oxy-\nhydroxides, and low Mn and Fe are not always reliable\nindicators of pristine calcite as both elements are insoluble\nunder oxic conditions (McArthur et al. 2000). Therefore, the Sr\nconcentration and isotope composition of the calcite could be\naltered during oxic diagensis without raising the Mn and Fe\ncontents to levels of concern. Popp et al. (1986) ascribed the\nvariability in Sr concentration as mainly due to taxonomic\ndifferences among samples; however Joachimski et al. (2005)\nobserved the highest concentrations in Silurian brachiopods\n(1211\u20131830 ppm) and much lower values (556\u2013707 ppm) in\nthose which were Permian in age. Steuber & Veizer (2002)\nexplained the trend in Sr\/Ca ratios measured in biogenic\nlow-Mg calcite from high values observed in the Silurian to\nlower ratios for the Carboniferous and Permian by the change\nin the predominant carbonate phase from Sr-rich calcite to\nSr-rich aragonite. Joachimski et al. (2005) therefore considered\nthat the low Sr concentrations in the Permian carbonates\nresulted from precipitation of shell calcite from seawater with\nlow Sr\/Ca ratios rather than from a diagenetic loss of Sr. Ca\nand Mg concentrations were analysed to establish the bulk\ncompositions of the shells.\nIn the present study, limits of 200 ppm for Mn and 400\u2013\n800 ppm for Sr have been adopted, and samples with\nFe>120 ppm have been excluded.\n4. Results\n4.1. Ultrastructural analyses\nThe shell structure of thirty-four specimens (OL14-1, OL16-35,\nOM48-14, in addition to those listed in Table 1) belonging to\neight different species of articulated brachiopods (Reedoconcha\npermixta, Derbyia haroubi, Neospirifer (Quadrospira) aff. hard-\nmani, Pachycyrtella omanensis, Pachycyrtella sp. A, Puncto-\ncyrtella spinosa, Cyrtella sp. A, Subansiria cf. ananti) was\nanalysed using a SEM (Figs 4\u20136).\nThe outer primary layer is very rarely preserved and it was\nonly clearly detected in one specimen (Fig. 5 (4)), where it\nshows an acicular fabric. The secondary layer is invariably\npresent with different degrees of preservation (Table 1) and\nshows two kinds of fabric: (i) calcite fibres in the spiriferids and\nspiriferinids (Fig. 4 (1\u20138), Fig. 5 (1\u20138)) as in the secondary\nlayer of recent Terebratulida and (ii) calcitic lamination in\nproductids and orthotetids (Fig. 6 (1\u20138), Fig. 7 (1)). The fabric\nof fibrous secondary shell is the result of the elongation of\ndiscrete patches of calcite into fibres within proteinaceous\nsheaths (Williams 1966, 1968, 1971; Williams in Williams et al.\n1997; McKinnon 1974). Fibres tend to grow differentially\nforming spiral arcs with local modifications and re-orientation\n(Fig. 5 (6)), but remaining strongly interlocked and orthodoxly\nstacked (Fig. 4 (2\u20135), Fig. 5 (7)). The secondary layer increases\nin thickness from the anterior margin to the umbo, where it\nshows consistent variation in the orientation of the calcite\nfibres producing shell strengthening (Alvarez 1990). In all the\ninvestigated spire-bearing genera the transverse sections of\northodoxly stacked fibres have a keel and saddle morphology,\n9\u201316 \u0004m wide and 2\u20135 \u0004m thick (Fig. 4 (1, 6), Fig. 5 (1\u20132, 8)),\nwith Neospirifer (Quadrospira) aff. hardmani showing the larg-\nest and thickest fibres. Its shell structure is consistent with that\nobserved by McKinnon (1974) for a Carboniferous species of\nNeospirifer, whose secondary orthodoxly stacked fibres\nmeasured up to 15 \u0004m in width.\nIn Pachycyrtella omanensis, Pachycyrtella sp. A, Puncto-\ncyrtella spinosa, Cyrtella sp. A and Subansiria cf. ananti the\nfibrous fabric is perforated by thin and sparse unbranched\npunctae (16\u201327 \u0004m in diameter) around which the fibres are\noutwardly deflected (Fig. 5 (3, 5)), but no perforate canopies at\ntheir distal end could be detected. These spiriferinid genera are\nthus characterised by punctate shells with very thin and sparse\npunctae, whose volume is negligible when compared with the\ntotal volume of the shell. This imply that the calcitic cements\nfilling the punctae are volumetrically negligible and do not\naffect the geochemical and isotopic analyses of the shells\n(Table 1).\nThe secondary fabric of the orthotetid Derbyia haroubi and\nof the productid Reedoconcha permixta is a cross-bladed\nlamination, which is well preserved in the former (Fig. 6 (1\u20133))\nand strongly altered in the latter (Fig. 6 (4\u20138)). Laminae are\nabout 1\u00b75\u20133 \u0004m thick in Derbyia haroubi, thus thicker than the\nlamination observed by Williams (1968, p. 43) in another\nPermian species of Derbyia. Pseudopunctae have been detected\nin both of these taxa, but are usually rarer and consist of\nrosettes of conical laminae (20\u201325 \u0004m wide) in Derbyia haroubi\n(Fig. 6 (2)), whereas they are coarser (50 \u0004m wide), densely\ndistributed and with a rod of recrystallised calcite at the core\n(taleola) in Reedoconcha permixta (Fig. 6 (7)). Hollow spines\ncommunicating with canals to the shell interior and formed by\nconcentric banding of flat laminae (Williams 1968) have also\nbeen detected in Reedoconcha permixta ((Fig. 6 (8)). The\nstrongly altered secondary fabric of Reedoconcha permixta\nmay be related to a higher organic content (proteinaceous\nmembranes), the porous fabric of in vivo taleolae (Williams\nin Williams et al. 1997) and to the occurrence of hollow\nbases of spines, which may have favoured dissolution and\nrecrystallisation.\nA few specimens of Neospirifer (Quadrospira) aff. hardmani,\nPachycyrtella omanensis and Derbyia haroubi show local traces\nof bioerosion (Fig. 4 (7); Fig. 6 (3)) probably caused by\nencrusting bryozoans and barnacles. These traces differ from\nthe porosity caused by punctae by their larger dimensions,\ntheir branched arrangement and by the absence of deflection of\nthe secondary layer fibres which surround them. Also they\ndevelop from the outer shell surface towards the interior,\nwithout reaching the innermost shell layer (Fig. 6 (3)). Their\nnumber, shape and arrangement (Fig. 8 (6)) indicate they are\ndomichnial borings (Angiolini et al. 2003a) and not boreholes\ncaused by predation, which are usually few per shell, are drilled\nperpendicular to shell surface and shoe site selectivity.\nBased on the preservation of the secondary layer fabric, the\nanalysed brachiopods were subdivided into two categories\n(Table 1): \u2018preserved\u2019 when all fibres\/laminae of the secondary\nlayer are intact (Fig. 4 (1\u20135), or when occasionally some\nfibres\/laminae are imperfectly shaped (Fig. 4 (6), Fig. 5 (8)); or\n\u2018diagenetically altered\u2019 when the fabric is obliterated by dis-\nsolution, amalgamation and recrystallisation (Fig. 6 (4, 6); Fig.\n7 (3, 5)).\n4.2. Cathodoluminescence\nFollowing SEM analysis, CL investigation of brachiopod\nshells was performed using a Nuclide luminoscope (ELM28)\noperating at 10 KV. Neospirifer (Quadrospira) aff. hardmani,\nPachycyrtella sp. A, Punctocyrtella spinosa and Subansiria cf.\nananti appear mostly non luminescent with rare thin lines or\nbright calcite punctae infillings (Fig. 8 (2, 4)). Generally there is\ngood correspondence to the shell ultrastructure, with preserved\nspecimens lacking any trace of luminescence indicating that the\nshells have not been affected by diagenesis (Fig. 8 (2)). When\nthe ultrastructure indicates dissolution, amalgamation and\nrecrystallisation of secondary layer fibres, the shell fabric is\nluminescent (Fig. 7 (3\u20136), Fig. 8 (3, 5)). In some cases it is likely\nthat luminescence, where it occurs, has been caused by diage-\nnetic diffusion of Mn from the matrix to the shell through\nBRACHIOPOD CLIMATE PROXIES 7\n8 L. ANGIOLINI ET AL.\nradial microfractures mainly produced by burial compaction\n(Fig. 7 (3\u20134), Fig. 8 (3)).\nHowever there are exceptions, for example a well-preserved\nsecondary laminar fabric, is seen in Derbyia haroubi but these\nspecimens are also characterised by a luminescent shell (Fig. 7\n(1\u20132), Fig. 8 (1)). This may be related to a higher organic\ncontent (proteinaceous membranes, luminescent in CL) in the\noriginal in vivo laminar fabric, whose post-mortem decompo-\nsition may cause an intra-laminar porosity. The latter in turn\ncontrolled the diffusion of Mn during diagenesis along laminar\nboundaries producing the pattern observed in Fig. 8 (1).\nThe specimens of Pachycyrtella omanensis show a very\npeculiar rhythmic pattern of bright CL lines, running diago-\nnally to the shell exterior. In most cases these microstructures\nare periodically spaced and uniformly wide, but in some\nspecimens they widen and grade into the surrounding non\nluminescent shell fabric (Fig. 7 (7\u20138), Fig. 8 (7)). Rhythmic CL\nlines are known to occur in modern brachiopods and some\nother marine invertebrates due to lower growth rates or\ngrowth disturbance (Barbin & Gaspard 1995), but they\nhave been only very recently detected in fossil brachiopods\n(Tomas\u02c7ovych & Farkas\u02c7 2005). These authors correlated the\ndistribution pattern of CL lines to changes in growth rates\ncaused by short-term environmental instability suggesting that\nspecies found in stable environmental settings are more likely\nto have a regular repetition of CL lines, whereas species of\nshallower water settings have an irregular CL line patterns.\nThis is supported by this study as we see that in some shells,\nthe width and spacing of CL lines is more irregular and\nespecially in Pachycyrtella omanensis which inhabited a\nshallow-water, physically-stressed, high-energy, environment.\nHowever, CL lines may also be related to diagenetic processes\n(Tomas\u02c7ovych & Farkas\u02c7 2005) and there is not enough data\nto solve this uncertainty. What is certain is that widening of\nCL lines into irregular fringed banding is due to diagenetic\ndiffusion (Fig. 8 (7)).\nThe relationships between preservation and luminescence\ncan be interpreted taking into account the characteristic of the\nbulk rock, which is generally characterised by different orange\ncolours recording the major diagenetic events. Most of the\nbioclasts (bivalves, gastropods, echinoderms, bryozoans) and\ncoated grains are predominantly orange (Fig. 8 (8)), whereas\nthe pristine fibrous secondary layer of brachiopods is usually\nblack. CL analysis of microfacies suggests that diagenesis did\nnot significantly affect the resistant original fibrous fabric of\nthe brachiopod shells.\n4.3. Elemental data\nAs stated in section 3, a limit of 200 ppm for Mn had been\nadopted in this study and samples with Fe>120 ppm have been\nexcluded. Not all the samples with high levels of Mn have\nelevated Fe contents (Table 1) and in the case of OM46-16,\nhigh Fe is accompanied by very low Mn. Also, whilst some\nsamples which exhibit diagenetic alteration have high Mn and\nFe, some have contents which would be deemed acceptable\n(OM46-9, OL17-4, OL15-66; I5-4).\nSr concentrations in the analysed brachiopods range from\n225 to 1335 ppm (Table 1), however all of the specimens with\nSr<500 ppm display other indicators of poor preservation.\nThree samples have much higher concentrations than the norm\nand Mn and Fe above the adopted cut-off levels. Sr levels\ngenerally decrease during diagenetic alteration of low-Mg\ncalcite; however if the fluid responsible for the alteration was\nSr rich, then increased concentrations might be observed.\nCelestite occurrences are reported from the top of the Al\nKhlata Formation and in the clastic basal deposits of the\nSaiwan Formation (Angiolini et al. 2003a, Le Me\u00b4tour et al.\n1994), possibly indicating migration of supersaline brines\nduring diagenesis.\nSr\/Ca ratios of the pristine brachiopods range from 0\u00b760 to\n0\u00b787 mmol\/mol and a Sr\/Ca ratio for seawater may be calcu-\nlated assuming a value for the molar distribution coefficient for\nSr of 0\u00b713 [DSr=(MSr\/MCa)carbonate\/(MSr\/MCa)seawater] as ob-\nserved in modern brachiopods (Steuber & Veizer 2002). The\nresultant mean ratio of 5\u00b735\u00040\u00b764 mmol\/mol is comparable\nwith values calculated by Steuber & Veizer (2002) for the Early\nPermian seas.\nInterestingly, brachiopods with laminar secondary layer\nshow trace element contents outside the acceptable values even\nwhen the ultrastructure is very well preserved (D. haroubi in\nOL15). This is in agreement with the data of Parkinson et al.\n(2005), who showed that extant brachiopods with laminar\nultrastructure (i.e. craniids) do not record ambient seawater\ncomposition and are not recommended as climate proxies.\nBrachiopods thought to retain pristine carbonate based on\nultrastructure, CL and trace elements are highlighted in bold in\nTable 1. Their isotopes values have been used to construct the\nsolid curves in Figure 3. However, there are four additional\nspecimens (OM46-9, OL17-4, OL15-66, I5-4; underlined in\nTable 1) which despite showing a diagenetically altered and\nluminescent shell fabric have acceptable contents of Fe, Mn\nand Sr. Those have been added using a dotted line in Figure 3\nand are discussed in the following sections.\n4.4. Stable isotope data\nCarbon and oxygen data from 31 brachiopod shells which\nwere analysed for stable isotopes range between +0\u00b75 and\n+5\u00b75\u2030 and \u00024\u00b72 to \u00020\u00b75\u2030 respectively. The lower \u000213C\noccur in samples where there is other evidence for alteration.\nHowever, on the whole, the stable isotope data do not provide\nsupporting evidence for alteration. The brachiopods which are\nthought to be comprised of pristine carbonate (samples high-\nlighted in bold, Table 1) have \u000213C between +3\u00b73 to +5\u00b74\u2030\nand \u000218O \u00023\u00b77 to \u00020\u00b75\u2030. The oxygen isotope data lies\nwithin the range that is generally thought to represent Permian\nseawater values (Korte et al. 2005).\nWhen plotted stratigraphically (solid symbols in Fig. 3), the\npristine brachiopods show the lowest \u000218O in the oldest\nspecimens (OL 14, n=3), increasing values in OL15 (n=4) and\nthe highest values in OL46 (n=1), before a decrease in OM47\n(n=1). The youngest samples (OM48) have the most variable\n\u000218O but all individuals (n=3) have \u000218O that is higher than\nFigure 4 Ultrastructure of Neospirifer (Quadrospira) aff.

ANGIOLINI ET AL.\nthe lowermost OL14. Plotting also the values of the four\nadditional specimens which show a diagenetically altered and\nluminescent shell fabric, but have acceptable contents of Fe,\nMn and Sr (samples underlined in Table 1 and represented by\nopen symbols in Fig. 3), results in a very similar trend which is\nslightly smoothed especially in correspondence of the decrease\nin OM47. Data from the stratigraphic level OL14 are derived\nfrom the use of the single species P. omanensis, whereas the\nresults from the overlying stratigraphic beds are obtained using\na combination of different species (N. (Q.) aff. hardmani,\nCyrtella sp. A, Pachycyrtella sp. A, P. spinosa, S. ananti): this\ncould imply a taxonomic control on the trend. However,\nParkinson et al. (2005) found no significant difference in \u000218O\nvalues from the secondary layer of four terebratulid and one\nrhynchonellid co-existing species, thus excluding a taxonomic\ncontrol on brachiopods with this standard ultrastructure. Also\nthe species Pachycyrtella omanensis may be restricted to bed\nOL14, but the genus Pachycyrtella ranges higher, and in bed\nOL15 it shows similar isotopic values to the co-existing N. (Q.)\naff. hardmani and Cyrtella sp. A, but very different values from\nthe ones recorded in OL14 (Table 1).\nThe down section range in \u000213C (Fig. 3) is almost the same\nas the within stratigraphical level range with the exception of\nOM46-17, where the lowest \u000213C corresponds with the highest\n\u000218O. This variation is less evident if the values of the four\nadditional specimens OM46-9, OL17-4, OL15-66, I5-4 are\nadded (dotted line in Fig. 3). However, carbon stable isotope\ncomposition of brachiopods may be affected by metabolism, so\nthat this variation may be not indicative of an environmental\nchange.\n4.5. Strontium isotope data\nThe strontium isotope ratios of brachiopod specimens from\nbed OL14 are significantly higher than those from higher levels\nin the sequence. The three samples considered to be pristine\n(highlighted in bold in Table 1) yield a mean 87Sr\/86Sr ratio of\n0\u00b77079378\u00040\u00b70000054 (2\u0003) and all of the less well-preserved\nsamples have higher ratios. Sample OL14-400 has a Sr isotope\ncomposition which approaches that obtained for a sample of\ncelestite from the base of the Saiwan Formation (0\u00b77082904: D.\nP. F. Darbyshire, unpublished data) suggesting that it might be\nthe source of the elevated Sr concentration. The mean ratio\nfor the four pristine specimens from level OL15 is\n0\u00b77078021\u00040\u00b70000058 (2\u0003), and with the exception of OL15-\n66, the altered samples display higher ratios. However, speci-\nmen OL15-23 with a Sr concentration of 1040 ppm did not\nhave the highest Sr isotope signature. Only one of the brachio-\npods from bed OL17\/OM46 passed all the selection criteria for\ngood preservation (OM46-17 87Sr\/86Sr=0\u00b77078169); surpris-\ningly the mean ratio for all five samples is almost identical\n(0\u00b77078167\u00040\u00b70000762), but the large error reflects the range\nin values. The values obtained by the two additional specimens\nOM46-9 and OL17-4 are very close to the value obtained by\nthe only one of the brachiopods which passed all the selection\ncriteria for good preservation (Fig. 3). Similarly, in the over-\nlying bed, only one sample was found to be pristine (OM47-23)\nand its Sr isotope signature (0\u00b77077801) is close to the average\nvalue for all six specimens (0\u00b77077845\u00040\u00b70000226). The best\nestimate of the external precision of a single measurement is\ngiven by the standard deviation of 128 analyses of north\nAtlantic seawater (\u00040\u00b70000096 2\u0003) over a 2-year period. So\nwhile the Sr isotope signatures of pristine brachiopods in beds\nOL15 and OL17\/OM46 overlap within analytical error, a\nsignificant decrease in ratio is observed in bed OM47. The\nthree well-preserved brachiopod specimens from OM48 dis-\nplay the widest range of 87Sr\/86Sr ratios and the mean value is\n0\u00b77077915\u00040\u00b70000318 (2\u0003). Variations of up to 50\u000510\u00026\nhave been observed in pristine brachiopods within the same\nstratigraphical level (e.g. Azmy et al. 1999). The diagenetically\naltered specimen (OM48-15) from this bed yielded a signifi-\ncantly higher ratio although the Sr content appeared to be\nunaffected lending credence to the suggestion that dense\npunctae may have diagenetically altered fillings.\n5. Interpretation and discussion\nThere are relatively few studies using stable isotopes specific to\nthe Early Permian. There are, however, low resolution isotope\ncurves which record seawater composition for most of the\nPhanerozoic based on compilations of the carbon and oxygen\nisotope ratios of brachiopod shells (e.g. Veizer et al. 1999).\nThrough the Phanerozoic, changes in marine \u000213C are inter-\npreted in terms of global changes in burial and re-oxidation of\norganic matter, although other processes such as release of low\n\u000213C volcanic or mantle CO2 into the atmosphere, discharges\nof oceanic methane and overturn of low \u000213C anoxic bottom\nwaters are all described (Korte et al. 2005). A recent study by\nPufahl et al. (2006) on Miocene brachiopods from an epeiric\nsea (South Australia) shows that higher \u000213C may be related to\nincreased aridification and decreasing continent derived nutri-\nents. Variation in \u000218O in brachiopod shells is thought to be\nlargely due to the growth and retreat of continental glaciers\n(e.g. Veizer et al. 1997). The Phanerozoic seawater curves show\nthat in the Early Permian there was a rapid decline in \u000218O,\nalthough the \u000213C curve is rather flat (Veizer et al. 1999).\nThe only specific Permian isotope seawater curves are based\non a compilation of brachiopod data from a series of discrete\nbasins (Korte et al. 2005). This \u000218O data shows a decline of\n2\u00b75\u2030 in the Early Permian (Asselian to Artinskian) (Korte\net al. 2005, fig. 8). The main cause of the decline, which\nreached a minimum in the Artinskian (Korte et al. 2005), was\nthe return of 18O-depleted glacial meltwater to the oceans after\nmelting of Carboniferous-Permian glaciers at high latitudes.\nCloser inspection of Korte\u2019s data set published online (doi:\n10.1016\/j.palaeo.2005\u00b703\u00b7015) shows that this decline is not as\nsmooth as the compiled data, notable is an excursion to higher\n\u000218O values, within the overall trend towards lower values, in\nthe Sakmarian. The Early Permian brachiopod data given in\nKorte et al. (2005) are entirely derived from the Southern\nUrals (sections from Usolka, Sakmara and Dalnij Tyulkas,\nFigure 5 Ultrastructure of Pachycyrtella omanensis (1\u20134), Pachycyrtella sp.

ANGIOLINI ET AL.\ndescribed in Chuvashov et al. 1990, 1991, 2002 (references in\nKorte et al. 2005)). The Southern Urals were palaeo-equatorial\nat this time, and brachiopods are thought to have lived in\nbasins that were open to the Palaeotethys Ocean. In general,\nthe compilation of data given in Korte et al. (2005) shows that\n\u000213C values in the Early Permian were stable around +4\u00b73\u2030.\nHigh-resolution isotopic data from the late Sakmarian\nSaiwan Formation show that \u000213C varies between +3\u00b73 and\n+4\u00b77\u2030, which is consistent with the data of Korte et al. (2005).\nHowever, there is an increase in \u000218O from basal values of\n\u00023\u00b77 to \u00023\u00b71\u2030 to a high of \u00020\u00b75\u2030, conflicting with the\nsmoothed data of Korte et al. (2005), though it may be\nequivalent to a similar increase seen in Korte\u2019s unsmoothed\ndata.\nExcluding a species-dependent effect (see section 4.4), the\nbasal low \u000218O values (\u00023\u00b77 to \u00023\u00b71\u2030) from OL14 are\nprobably related to an influx of 18O-depleted glacial melt\nwater. This is supported by the presence of the Pachycyrtella\npalaeocommunity, a cold-water opportunistic fauna that is the\nfirst recorded above glacigene sediments in the Oman succes-\nsion. There are two explanations for the subsequent \u000218O\nincrease through the Saiwan Formation. The increase could be\nrelated to ice accumulation. Though the Oman succession\nshows no glacigene sediments above the Rahab Shale\n(Stephenson et al. 2005), there is evidence for glacial con-\nditions, in the form of lonestones, within late Sakmarian-\nArtinskian sediments in eastern Australia and Tasmania\n(Banks & Clarke 1987; Frank et al. 2005; Fielding et al. 2005;\nDickins 1996; Martini & Banks 1989) and also from biotic\nrecords in eastern Australia during the latest Sakmarian (see\nStephenson et al. in press). However, except for localised\nice-centres and the presence of seasonal rafting ice, there is no\nevidence for a regionally continental-scale ice accumulation in\nEastern Gondwana after the early Permian (G. Shi, written\ncomm.).\nThere is thus a second explanation for the observed \u000218O\nvalues in the Saiwan Formation above OL14. Increasing \u000218O\nwould occur in a marine basin where high evaporation causes\nseawater \u000218O (and subsequently \u000218O in the brachiopods) to\nrise, and this commonly occurs with little impact on seawater\nsalinity and thus on the distribution of ecological niches.\nSurface and subsurface facies and geological evidence shows\nthat the Saiwan Formation\/Lower Gharif member was de-\nposited in an embayment south of the Oman Mountains (Fig.\n2). The area, now occupied by the Oman Mountains, was a\nrising rift shoulder in the Sakmarian related to the opening of\nthe Neotethys Ocean (Angiolini et al. 2003a, b) which prob-\nably limited circulation between the Haushi Sea and the\nNeotethys Ocean. In addition, postglacial warming, increasing\naridity and northward drift of Arabia and Gondwana during\nthis interval (Angiolini et al. 2003b, Stephenson et al. 2005)\nwould contribute to higher evaporation. A similar scenario\nwas envisaged for the Delaware Basin (Guadalupe Moun-\ntains), where brachiopods were found to have high \u000218O in the\nKungurian and Guadalupian (Korte et al. 2005). The general\ntrend towards slightly heavier \u000213C supports not only increas-\ning aridity, but also decreasing nutrients, as shown for the\nepeiric Murray Basin in the Miocene by Pufahl et al. (2006).\nThe LOWESS 87Sr\/86Sr curve of McArthur & Howarth\n(2004) is relatively flat for Asselian and Sakmarian sea-\nwater with values around 0\u00b77081, but at the beginning of the\nArtinskian there is a steep decline in the ratio to 0\u00b77075. The\nseawater curve for the Cisuralian is based on data from\nDenison et al. (1994a) and Martin & McDougall (1995) and is\ndefined by a relatively small number of data points, particu-\nlarly in the Sakmarian. Denison et al. (1994a) measured\nisotope ratios of lime mudstones and wackestones from the\nUSA whereas Martin & McDougall (1995) analysed cono-\ndonts from the USA and Pakistan. Denison et al. (1994a, b)\nconsidered that as limemud-supported rocks excluded foreign\npore fluids more effectively, they were more likely to retain the\noriginal seawater isotope composition. They adopted a rejec-\ntion criterion of Sr\/Mn>2 and Mn<300 ppm; however\nMcArthur & Howarth (2004) used only some of the data from\nthis suite of samples.\nThere is some evidence (Ebneth et al. 2001) that conodonts\nyield more radiogenic signatures than brachiopods of compar-\nable age because they are susceptible to isotopic exchange with\nthe surrounding matrix. However, Martin & McDougall\n(1995) focused on the time interval from middle Permian\n(Kungurian) to early Triassic, so there is no overlap with the\nsamples measured here.\nAll of the pristine brachiopods analysed in this study display\nSr isotope signatures that are less radiogenic than indicated by\nthe LOWESS seawater curve (McArthur & Howarth 2004) for\nthe Sakmarian. It might be argued that given the proximal\nenvironment postulated for the surface Saiwan Formation\n(Angiolini et al. 2006), the seawater would be more likely to\nhave a terrigenous contribution. However, this component\nwould have an even lower Sr isotope ratio, which tends to rule\nout sedimentary sources. Volcanic lithics are abundant in the\nupper part of the Al Khlata Formation and granitoid rock\nfragments are common. However, the Pachycyrtella Bed at the\nbase of the Saiwan Formation is arkosic in composition, with\na reduction in the amount of quartz indicating widespread\nexposure of granitoid to gneissic basement (Angiolini et al.\nFigure 6 Ultrastructure of Derbyia haroubi (1\u20133) and Reedoconcha permixta (4\u20138): (1) Well-preserved secondary\nlayer lamination, specimen OL15-23, dorsal valve; (2) Calcitic cross-bladed lamination showing pseudopuncta-\ntion in the form of rosettes of conical laminae (arrow), specimen OL15-23, dorsal valve; (3) Well-preserved\nsecondary layer lamination showing two traces of bioerosion (arrows), specimen OL15-15, ventral valve; (4)\nCalcitic cross-bladed lamination strongly affected by diagenetic alteration, specimen OL16-35, ventral valve; (5)\nCalcitic cross-bladed lamination strongly deflected by pseudopunctation, specimen OL16-35, ventral valve; (6)\nCalcitic cross-bladed lamination strongly affected by diagenetic alteration, specimen OL16-35, ventral valve; (7)\nPseudopunctum with taleola, a rod of recrystallised calcite at the core (arrow), specimen OL16-35, ventral valve;\n(8) Section of the base of a hollow spine (arrow), showing concentric banding, specimen OL16-35, ventral valve.\nFigure 7 SEM and petrological microscope photographs of specimens showed in the left column of Figure 8: (1)\nSEM laminar fabric, Derbyia haroubi, specimen OL15-23, dorsal valve; (2) Petrological microscope photograph\nin transmitted light, Derbyia haroubi, specimen OL15-23, dorsal valve; (3) SEM recrystallised fabric, Neospirifer\n(Quadrospira) aff. hardmani, specimen OL15-140, ventral valve; (4) Petrological microscope photograph in\ntransmitted light, Neospirifer (Quadrospira) aff. hardmani, specimen OL15-140, ventral valve; (5) SEM shell fabric\nshowing diagenetic alteration (left), Cyrtella sp.

ANGIOLINI ET AL.\nFigure 8 Caption overleaf.\nBRACHIOPOD CLIMATE PROXIES 15\n2003a). Rivers draining these rocks are less likely to acquire a\nlow Sr isotope signature. It is therefore more plausible to\nsuggest that the pristine brachiopods analysed in this study are\nrecording the late Sakmarian seawater signature in the region.\nThe Sr\/Ca ratios are typical of the Early Permian seas else-\nwhere (Steuber & Veizer 2002) and preliminary data for\nbrachiopods from the equivalent beds in the subsurface Haushi\nlimestone (Angiolini et al., unpublished data) indicate similar\nor slightly more negative Sr isotope ratios. The brachiopod\nassemblage in the subsurface Haushi limestone is consistent\nwith a deeper marine environment, more distant from the\nsource of terrigenous input. If the 87Sr\/86Sr ratios of the\nbrachiopods from the surface Saiwan Formation reflected a\nriverine contribution to the seawater at the basin margin, then\nwe might expect to find higher ratios in those from the deeper\nwaters of the basin, but this was not observed.\n6. Conclusions\nThe Lower Permian (Sakmarian) succession of the Haushi\nbasin, Interior Oman (Saiwan Formation\/lower Gharif mem-\nber) records rapid climate change through glacial conditions to\nsubtropical desert. This was caused by global warming follow-\ning the Permo-Carboniferous glaciation, enhanced by north-\nward continental drift during the Early Permian.\nPalynological, \u000213Corg and organic geochemical studies\n(Stephenson et al. 2005) show palaeoenvironmental change\nthrough the lower part of the succession in south Oman. The\nisotope record may have resulted from climate amelioration\nthrough increases in palaeoatmospheric CO2. Studies of simi-\nlar beds at outcrop show changes in the fauna including the\ndevelopment of a pioneer cold-water brachiopod community\n(OL14), followed by a more mature secondary ecological\ncommunity of a more diversified marine biota (OL15\u2013OL18),\nindicating significant climatic amelioration and concomitant\ndecrease in nutrient availability (Angiolini et al. 2003a).\nTo investigate the palaeoclimatology and the evolution of\nthe Haushi sea in Interior Oman a combination of O, C, and Sr\nisotopes was used on bed-by-bed-collected brachiopod shells\nwithin the Saiwan Formation. The degree of diagenetic altera-\ntion and rejected shells not meeting strict preservation criteria\nwas assessed. Spiriferids and spiriferinids show better preser-\nvation of the fibrous secondary layer than do orthotetids and\nproductids, whose laminar secondary layer is usually altered\nand\/or luminescent. Spiriferids are the most suitable for iso-\ntopic analysis.\nThree sets of isotope data (C, O and Sr) are consistent with\ntwo possible scenarios. In an open ocean setting, the carbon\nand oxygen would suggest maximum deglaciation within the\nbase of the Saiwan and then a return to glacial conditions\nelsewhere in Gondwana, which however it is not generally\nsupported by the sedimentology and palaeontology of\nGondwanan regions (SE Australia) and by published\nsmoothed curves. There is a suggestion in the data of Korte\net al. (2005) that there are minor irregularities in the un-\nsmoothed curve that may account for the upturn in the\nSaiwan. The Sr isotope data does not conform to the published\nseawater curve for the Sakmarian, but as this is based on\nextrapolation between a few data points, it is possible that the\nSr does reflect open ocean in this region. Alternatively, the\nupturn in the oxygen isotope data may reflect evaporation,\nimplying a restricted Haushi basin south of the Neotethys rift\nshoulder, in which case the variation in Sr isotope composition\nmay reflect a fluvial component. The Sr concentration would\nincrease with evaporation, but the isotope ratio would not\nchange. The trend towards higher \u000213C may indicate increasing\naridity and oligotrophy. This second scenario sounds more\nlogical and reasonable.\n7. Acknowledgements\nWe like to express our sincere thanks to C. Arrowsmith, M.\nBrunetti, J. Green, C. Malinverno, A. Rizzi and A.
