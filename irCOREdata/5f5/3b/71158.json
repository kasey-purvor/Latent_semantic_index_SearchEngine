O. Box 503, Helsinki, FIN-00101, Finland\n4on leave from Murmansk State Technical University, Sportivnaya 13, Murmansk, 183010, Russia\nReceived: 6 October 2003 \u2013 Revised: 22 January 2004 \u2013 Accepted: 3 February 2004 \u2013 Published: 8 April 2004\nAbstract. The meridional motions of the CUTLASS HF and\nSTARE VHF coherent echoes, IMAGE equivalent electro-\njet currents, and IRIS absorption patches during the post-\nnoon\/early-evening event of 14 February 2000 are presented.\nThe motions were found to be synchronous, to a first ap-\nproximation, for all instruments. The temporal correlation\nbetween motions in the radar and magnetometer data was\nexceptionally good, although spatially the areas with the E-\nregion backscatter and most intense equivalent currents were\nnot coincident, with the HF (VHF) echoes being shifted 100\u2013\n200 km (20\u201350 km) equatorward (poleward). The meridional\nmotions of the radar echoes and electrojet currents appeared\nto be controlled by the IMF Bz changes; the meridional prop-\nagation direction was equatorward (poleward) during the in-\ntervals when the IMF was southward (northward), with one\nexception when the poleward progression continued after the\nIMF southward turning. We relate the observed meridional\nmotion patterns to the polar cap expansion\/contraction dur-\ning variable IMF conditions and discuss the relative impor-\ntance of two types of processes: the dayside reconnection and\nIMF-triggered substorms. We also investigate the irregularity\nDoppler velocity for the STARE (144 MHz) and CUTLASS\n(12 MHz) observations at large flow angles in the context of\nthe eastward and westward electrojet systems. We show that\nthe 144-MHz Doppler velocity is determined by a combi-\nnation of two factors: the sense of electrojet currents and\nthe aspect angle conditions within the STARE field of view.\nFinally, the behavior of small dayside enhancements of the\nIRIS absorption (up to 0.5 dB at 38.2 MHz) accompanying\nthe radar echoes and electrojet currents is examined. Since\nthe velocity of the meridional displacements was close to that\nof the poleward\/equatorward progressing intense currents, it\nis suggested that the absorption patches observed during the\nevent were related to the heating of the E-region plasma by\nthe unstable plasma waves in the regions of enhanced electric\nfields.\nCorrespondence to: R.

Ionosphere (auroral ionosphere; electric fields\nand currents; plasma convection)\n1 Introduction\nThe high-latitude ionosphere is a highly dynamic medium\nwith complex, interrelated processes occurring simultane-\nously. The coherent radars in the UHF, VHF, and HF bands\nhave proved to be useful instruments for studying these pro-\ncesses (see, for example, the review papers by Nielsen, 1982;\nGreenwald et al., 1995, and references therein). Such radars\nroutinely detect echoes from the magnetic-field-aligned ir-\nregularities in the ionosphere. The advantage of coherent\nradars is in their relatively good spatial and temporal reso-\nlutions (typically of the order of 30 km and 1 min, respec-\ntively) and significant coverage (as much as 106 km2). The\nphenomenon of coherent echo detection from the auroral E-\nregion is often referred to as the radar aurora.\nInformation on the amplitude and Doppler velocity is fun-\ndamentally important for understanding the plasma physics\nof the irregularity formation (Fejer and Kelley, 1980; Sahr\nand Fejer, 1996). The Doppler velocity measurements are\nalso extensively used for monitoring plasma motions at vari-\nous heights (Greenwald et al., 1978, 1995). It has been shown\nthat the UHF and VHF E-region echoes collocate with the\nareas of intense electrojet currents (Greenwald et al., 1975;\nTsunoda et al., 1976). Moreover, the echo strength was found\nto be a measure of the electrojet intensity (Greenwald et al.,\n1973; Uspensky et al., 1983; Starkov et al., 1983). Coherent\nradars hence can be used for tracing the auroral electrojets.\nIt has also been established that the E-region echoes often\noccur in the areas adjacent to the visual auroral arcs (Green-\nwald et al., 1973; Tsunoda et al., 1976), so that they can pro-\nvide valuable information for the auroral arc physics as well\n(Timofeev et al., 1987).\nMore recently, with the construction of a number of\nthe Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN)\nHF radars, studies of the high-latitude ionosphere and\n1650 R.

The experimental setup in Northern Scandinavia show-\ning the near (r<1200 km) fields of view of the CUTLASS (grey)\nand STARE (white) Finland radars. The nominal directions of\nthe CUTLASS (STARE) beams 0\u201315 (1\u20138) are indicated by the\nsolid (dashed) straight lines. Also shown are slant range marks\n(dashed circular curves) and PACE lines of equal magnetic latitudes\n3=60\u25e6, 65\u25e6, and 70\u25e6 (solid black curves). The black thin curves\n\u03b1=\u22122\u25e6, \u22121\u25e6, 0\u25e6 represent the geometrical off-perpendicular (as-\npect) angle lines at 110 km. The heavy black curve \u03b1=0\u25e6 is the\nperfect aspect angle line at 110 km, assuming a model electron den-\nsity profile and a radar frequency of 12 MHz. The location (with the\nthree-letter abbreviation) of the stations of the IMAGE and SAM-\nNET magnetometer networks close to the radars\u2019 FoV is shown by\ntriangles. The open circles (with digits nearby showing the beam\nnumber) represent the easternmost IRIS beams (at 100 km) close to\nthe meridional direction of interest. The DMSP pass (F13: 14:18\u2013\n14:21 UT) with the measured perpendicular ion velocities is indi-\ncated by black vectors. The scale for the ion velocities is shown in\nthe top right corner of the diagram.\nmagnetosphere with HF coherent radars have become popu-\nlar. The advantage of HF coherent radars is in their ability to\ndetect echoes not only from the E-region but also from the F-\nregion (at UHF and VHF, detection of the E-region echoes is\nonly possible), so that additional information on the plasma\nthere can be obtained (Milan and Lester, 1998; Koustov et\nal., 2002). The comparisons between the echo characteris-\ntics at HF and VHF have also been used recently for studies\nof the plasma physics of irregularity formation (Koustov et\nal., 2002; Makarevitch et al., 2002).\nIn this paper we advance our knowledge on radar au-\nrora dynamics with the disturbance development at high lat-\nitudes by exploring the joint HF and VHF radar data in the\nScandinavian sector, where data from several facilities are\navailable, including the Co-operative UK Twin Located Au-\nroral Sounding System (CUTLASS) HF radar (\u223c12 MHz)\nand Scandinavian Twin Auroral Radar Experiment (STARE)\nVHF radar (\u223c144 MHz). Following classical UHF and VHF\nstudies (e.g. Greenwald et al., 1973; Tsunoda et al., 1976)\nwe consider the radar echoes in the context of other phenom-\nena, such as magnetic disturbances, riometer absorption, etc.\nOur target is the radar frequency effects (HF versus VHF),\nso that HF radar capabilities can be better understood. We\nconcentrate on the afternoon\/early-evening sector of obser-\nvations for which the relationship of HF radar echoes with\nvarious phenomena is not well established. More specifi-\ncally, the purpose of the present report is, first of all, to inves-\ntigate the meridional displacements of HF and VHF echoes\nand the potential reasons for these motions. Secondly, we\nexplore the details of the spatial distributions of the VHF and\nHF Doppler velocity and compare them with the electrojet\nstructure as observed by magnetometers. In this way, we at-\ntempt to complement previous radar studies which concen-\ntrated on the echo intensity. Finally, we compare the motions\nof the radar echoes and equivalent currents with those of the\nriometer absorption patches, in attempt to reveal the factor(s)\nresponsible for the riometer absorption during the event.\n2 Experiment setup\nIn this study, we used the data collected by the CUTLASS\nFinland radar located at Hankasalmi, Finland (62.3\u25e6 N,\n26.6\u25e6 E, geographic), oriented towards magnetic north. The\nradar is analogous technically and operationally to all other\nSuperDARN radars described in some detail by Greenwald\net al. (1995) (see also Milan et al., 1997). The Hankasalmi\nantenna array consists of 16 log-periodic antennas (with both\ntransmitting and receiving capabilities) that are phased rela-\ntive to one another to form the field of view (FoV) centered at\nthe boresite direction of\u221212\u25e6 E (east of geographic north, or\n+12\u25e6 W). The radar sweeps through 16 beam positions (sep-\narated by 3.24\u25e6) in 2 min, with the 7-s dwell time in each\nposition. The measurements of the Doppler velocity, power,\nand spectral width are made by using a 7-pulse transmission\nsequence that allows for the 18-lag auto-correlation function\n(ACF) determination. The data are available in 45-km steps\nfor ranges 180\u20133500 km.\nFigure 1 shows the near FoV (slant range r<1200 km) of\nthe CUTLASS Finland radar by a grey sector. The dashed\ncircular curves represent the slant range marks. Also shown\nin Fig. 1 by heavy solid black curves are the Polar Anglo-\nAmerican Conjugate Experiment (PACE) lines of equal mag-\nnetic latitudes 3=60\u25e6, 65\u25e6, and 70\u25e6 (Baker and Wing, 1989).\nIn this study we also used the data collected by the STARE\nVHF radar. In the standard STARE mode (we use only such\ndata), the double-pulse phase delay measurements are used\nto determine the Doppler velocity of the E-region echoes\n(\u223c110 km) and the single-pulse data are used to determine\nthe power of echoes (Greenwald et al., 1978; Nielsen, 1982).\nThe echoes are monitored in 8 beams separated by 3.6\u25e6 in az-\nimuth, so that the STARE radar FoV is somewhat narrower\nthan the CUTLASS FoV (28.8\u25e6 versus \u223c52\u25e6). The STARE\nradar antenna boresite direction is\u221219.1\u25e6 E. The data are in-\ntegrated over 20 s. In terms of range, the measurements are\nR. A. Makarevitch et al.: Meridional motions of the afternoon radar aurora 1651\nperformed from 495 to 1245 km with a 15-km resolution. We\nshowed the STARE Finland radar FoV in Fig. 1 by the white\nsector; the central positions of the STARE beams are indi-\ncated by the dashed straight lines.\nThe aspect angle conditions for coherent radar observa-\ntions in the Scandinavian sector are quite favorable. To illus-\ntrate this, we show in Fig. 1 by thin black curves the lines of\ngeometrical or rectilinear aspect angle \u03b1= \u2212 2\u25e6,\u22121\u25e6, and\n0\u25e6 at 110 km. In a large area, very little bending of the\nradar beam is required to reach orthogonality with the mag-\nnetic field at the E-region heights. Since the frequency of\nthe STARE radar is 144 MHz, one need not consider refrac-\ntion of the radio waves for typical E-region densities and one\ncan expect that the STARE echoes would occur in the broad\narea of the ionosphere, with the strongest echoes near the\nranges of minimum achievable aspect angle. For the high-\nnumber beams, the aspect angle conditions are quite interest-\ning; the perfect aspect angle line \u03b1=0\u25e6 (thin) intersects the\nbeams twice (e.g. for beam 8, at 700 and 1000 km), so that\none would expect strong VHF echoes to occur at two sets of\nranges.\nFor the CUTLASS radar (12 MHz), refraction can be sig-\nnificant; to illustrate its effect we show by heavy black line\nin Fig. 1 the expected zero aspect angle line computed in a\nsimple geometrical optics approach of Uspensky et al. (1994)\nfor a typical (for the location and time of observations) elec-\ntron density profile from the model (Bilitza, 2001). The\nelectron density profile used has a broad maximum at the\nelectrojet heights around 110 km, with the maximum den-\nsity \u223c7\u00b7104 cm\u22123. One would expect the HF echoes to oc-\ncur preferentially at ranges close to the heavy black line, at\n\u223c400 km, which is \u223c300 km equatorward of the expected\nranges of the STARE echoes.\nFigure 1 also shows by triangles the locations of the In-\nternational Monitor for Auroral Geomagnetic Effects (IM-\nAGE) fluxgate magnetometers in the vicinity of the radars\u2019\nFoV (e.g. Luhr et al., 1998) and by open circles the central\npositions (at 100 km) of several beams of the Imaging Ri-\nometer for Ionospheric Studies (IRIS) at Kilpisjarvi, Finland\n(69.1\u25e6 N, 20.8\u25e6 E). The IRIS riometer (Browne et al., 1995;\ndel Pozo et al., 2002) records the non-deviative cosmic noise\nabsorption (CNA) at 38.2 MHz at 49 different directions with\n1-s resolution, although some post-integration is usually em-\nployed. We show only those IRIS beams (digits nearby indi-\ncate the IRIS beam number) that were the closest to the area\nof interest 23\u25e6 E, geographic (see Sect. 3.2) and that were\nnot affected by the solar radiation\/ionospheric scintillations\nduring the event.\nTo provide an overall perspective on various measure-\nments, we present in Fig. 2a the geometry of the observa-\ntions in the vertical plane along the meridian. The STARE\nVHF radar beam (straight line) reaches orthogonality with\nthe magnetic field (indicated by the slightly inclined long ar-\nrows) at an E-region height of \u223c110 km. The CUTLASS\nHF radar is able to reach the orthogonality condition at both\nE- and F-region heights (\u223c110 and \u223c300 km, respectively).\nThe radio waves can be scattered back from the magnetic-\nS\nN\nF region 300 km\nE region 110 km\nVHF\nHF:E\nHF: F\nHorizon\nM\nag\nn\netic\nF\nield\nL\nin\ne\na) b)\nFig. 2.

Ex-\namples of two IMAGE magnetometers and three beams of\nthe IRIS riometer measuring the magnetic field perturbations\nand CNA, respectively, are shown in Fig. 2a by triangles\nand oblong figures. We return to this diagram, panel (b), in\nSect. 4 where we interpret the observations.\n3 Observations\nOn 14 February 2000, 11\u201318 UT (\u223c13\u201320 MLT), the CUT-\nLASS HF radar observed bands of both E- and F-region\nbackscatter that were moving along the meridian, which have\nresulted in the appearance of the quite remarkable \u201cV-\u201d and\neven \u201cW-like signatures\u201d in the range-time-intensity (RTI)\nplots. The STARE VHF radar observed similar signatures in\nthe E-region backscatter.\nThe period under consideration was characterized by the\nmoderate level of magnetic activity; the global Kp index\nwas between 4+ and 5+. According to the Advanced Com-\nposition Explorer (ACE) satellite, the solar wind velocity\n(along the x-axis) and proton number density were around\n640 km\/s and 8 cm\u22123, respectively, for almost the entire pe-\nriod. The propagation time from the satellite upstream point\n(1.54\u00b7106 km from the Earth) can be estimated using these\nvalues. The 3-step technique of Khan and Cowley (1999)\napplied to our event gives a result of\u223c45 min and from here-\nafter we adopt this value as the time required for changes in\nthe IMF conditions to reach the Earth\u2019s ionosphere.\n3.1 Echo band motions at HF and VHF\nFigures 3a and b show the time-lagged by 45 min IMF Bz, By\ncomponents, respectively, measured by the ACE magnetic\nfield instrument (Smith et al., 1998) with 16-s resolution.\nThe positive (negative) IMF Bz data are shown by red (blue)\ncolor. The time intervals corresponding to the positive (neg-\native) IMF Bz are marked by dark (light) grey background\nfor all panels of the diagram. The heavy vertical black lines\n1652 R. A. Makarevitch et al.: Meridional motions of the afternoon radar aurora\nrepresent the sudden northward IMF turnings (SNITs). Two\nbottom panels are the RTI plots of the signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR) for the (c) STARE beam 8 and (d) CUTLASS beam 9.\nDuring data post-processing the ground scatter echoes in the\nCUTLASS data were removed from the records. The echoes\nthat had low SNR (<3 dB) and unusually large spectral width\n(>500 m\/s) were also not considered.\nThe IMF Bz was negative and more or less stable\n(\u223c\u22127 nT) for over 2 h from 11:05 to 13:10 UT in the begin-\nning of the interval under study; the By component varied\nin random fashion around zero. At 11:20 UT the STARE\nradar started to detect the echoes at 800 and 1000 km. Af-\nter \u223c1200 UT the echoes started to show a regular equator-\nward displacement. To facilitate the monitoring of the effect\nwe computed the range of the echo maximum at each instant\nand connected the obtained points by solid black line; see\nthe ragged black lines in panel (c). The equatorward motion\nwas especially clear after 12:20 UT when both VHF and HF\nechoes intensified. To estimate the velocity of equatorward\nprogression we fitted the straight line to the maximum power\nrange location curve. This fitted line is indicated in Fig. 3b\nby a white line with the digits representing the echo band\ndisplacement speed along the radar beam.\nSimilar meridional motions were observed by the CUT-\nLASS radar; see panel (d) for beam 9, Fig. 3. The HF echoes\nfirst appeared at 11:15 UT at 500 km. The equatorward pro-\ngression speed was slightly lower, 100 m\/s, as compared to a\nspeed of 114 m\/s for STARE. Interestingly, equatorward mo-\ntion of HF echoes was also observed at ranges 900\u20131200 km.\nThese echoes are usually associated with the scatter from the\nF-region (Milan et al., 1997; Danskin et al., 2002; Koustov et\nal., 2002). The F-region HF echo band displacement speed\nwas larger, around 142 m\/s.\nAt 13:10 UT the IMF abruptly changed its direction from\nsouthward to northward, which is shown by the first black\nvertical line in Fig. 3. Almost immediately after this IMF\nturning, the STARE echoes started to move away from the\nradar, Fig. 3c. The IMF returned back to the southward ori-\nentation in about 10 min but the poleward echo band progres-\nsion continued up until 14:00 UT, when it stopped and be-\ncame equatorward again. The second equatorward progres-\nsion continued until \u223c14:15 UT when the second SNIT oc-\ncurred. At HF, the situation was very reminiscent of the one\nat VHF, except the HF echoes started to move poleward after\nthe first IMF northward turning not at 13:10 UT but some-\nwhat later. From 13:20 to 14:00 UT, the F-region echoes be-\ncame strong and abundant enough to be traced as poleward\nprogressing.\nAfter the second SNIT at 14:15 UT, the strongest STARE\nechoes were observed at 630 km; the poleward motion of the\necho band was less obvious here compared to the case of the\nIMF reversal at 13:10 UT; the range of maximum power was\njumping between 630 and 735 km but one can notice that the\n\u223c8- and 16-dB contours of SNR at the equatorial edge were\nmoving poleward. At HF, the poleward progression after the\nsecond SNIT started \u223c10 min later and it was very clear. We\nnote that at 14:40 UT the By component sharply changed its\nsign with no apparent effect in the echo band motions either\nat VHF or at HF.\nAt 16:23 UT Bz, again, became negative and soon after\nthat both VHF and HF radars started to detect echoes. For\nboth radars, the echoes were moving to the radar until the\ntime of the third IMF reversal, 17:25 UT. Similar to the two\nprevious cases, the change in the direction of the HF echo\nband meridional displacement was slightly delayed with re-\nspect to the time of the IMF reversal. The poleward progres-\nsion apparently stopped soon after the Bz became negative\nat 17:45 UT, again, with larger delay at HF. We would like\nto point out here for future reference that a second distinct\nband of VHF echoes appeared at 17:25 UT at farther ranges\nof \u223c1000 km.\nThe RTI plots for the STARE beam 8 and CUTLASS beam\n9 (roughly along the magnetic meridian) presented in Fig. 3\nindicate that the echo bands were moving in range as a whole\nas well. Also, we note that the exact range position of the\npower maxima was not exactly coincident with the expected\nranges of perfect aspect angle either at VHF or at HF.\n3.2 Electrojet meridional motions according to the IMAGE\nmagnetometers\nTo judge the dislocation of electrojet currents during the\nevent we employed the method of spherical elementary cur-\nrent systems (Amm and Viljanen, 1999; Pulkkinen et al.,\n2003). The method requires a continuous data record-\ning throughout the event for the magnetometers considered\n(mostly for convenience of programming and computation\ntime minimization), therefore, the data from KEV and KIR\nstations were excluded from the analysis. The complete list\nof considered stations is UPS, NUR, DOB, HAN, OUJ, LYC,\nRVK, PEL, SOD, MUO, LEK, ABK, KIL, AND, MAS,\nTRO, SOR, BJN, HOP, HOR, LYR, and NAL. All magne-\ntometer data were post-integrated with a period of 1 min.\nThe results of calculations are illustrated in Fig. 4 which\nshows the equivalent current density J at 24.8\u25e6 east of geo-\ngraphic north at 100 km altitude as a function of geographic\nlatitude and universal time. The contours filled with solid\ncolor (horizontal lines) correspond to the eastward (west-\nward) electrojet. We reproduce in Fig. 4 the grey scale shad-\ning scheme of the background from Fig. 3. To facilitate com-\nparison with the radar data we also show in Fig. 4 the location\nof the center of eastjet current system (latitude of maximum\ncurrent, J>200 A\/km) by the red line. The location of the\nmaximum backscatter power for the STARE beam 8 (CUT-\nLASS beam 9) from Fig. 3 is shown by the white (orange)\nline(s). For CUTLASS data, these locations are shown for\nthe F- and E-region echo bands separately.\nFrom 11:05 to 13:10 UT the eastward current center\nmoved towards the equator. At \u223c13:10 UT the first SNIT\noccurred and the motion became poleward. The motions be-\ntween the eastward electrojet center and the boundary be-\ntween eastward and westward electrojets are well synchro-\nnized (red line follows closely the J=0 contour but shifted\nequatorward by 2\u25e6\u20133\u25e6), indicating that the electrojet was\nR.

The IRIS keogram at 23.0\u25e6 E (geographic). The black line is a contour J=0 from Fig. 4 representing the boundary between eastward\nand westward electrojets. On the top we reproduce the grey-scale shading from Fig. 3; the dark (light) grey shade corresponds to the time\ninterval when time-lagged by 45 min ACE IMF Bz component was positive (negative).\nmoving as a whole and was to a certain degree homogeneous.\nAt\u223c14:00 UT the eastjet center again changed its meridional\nmotion direction to the equator. Note that no changes in the\nIMF conditions were observed at this moment. The equator-\nward progression was, however, not long this time; it ended\nat \u223c14:20 UT. After that, the poleward progression of the\nelectrojet system was observed, up until\u223c16:10 UT. The last\nchange in the direction of the meridional motion from equa-\ntorward to poleward during the considered period occurred\nat 17:30 UT.\nThe meridional displacement of the strongest VHF\nbackscatter (white line) was in good agreement with the most\nintense equivalent current location (red line). For the 12:30\u2013\n14:30 UT interval, when both were the closest to the radar,\nthe white line is 20\u201350 km poleward. At 17:30 UT the white\nline suddenly jumps up by more than 3\u25e6 of latitude and stays\nat 70\u25e6 for about 10 min. This jump is clearly associated with\nthe appearance of the second band of VHF echoes at this time\n(Fig. 3).\nThe location of the strongest backscatter at HF (orange\nlines) significantly differed from the position of either the\nstrongest VHF echoes or the most intense equivalent current.\nThe lower orange curve corresponding to the E-region echoes\nis systematically equatorward of the STARE echoes and most\nof the time equatorward of the current center. The meridional\nmotions of the E-region echoes at HF were nevertheless well\ncorrelated with those of VHF scatter and eastward electro-\njet. The correlation with the latter was truly remarkable from\n12:40 to 14:20 UT. The situation was somewhat different for\nthe F-region echoes (upper orange curve) which appeared at\nR. A. Makarevitch et al.: Meridional motions of the afternoon radar aurora 1655\nthe latitudes of the eastward electrojet (e.g. 12:00\u201312:40 UT),\nas well as of the westward electrojet (13:30\u201313:40 UT). In\nboth cases, the CUTLASS F-region echoes were located sig-\nnificantly poleward from the latitudes of the eastjet center\nand the STARE echoes. The meridional motions of the F-\nregion echoes, however, overall, corresponded rather well to\nthose in the STARE and IMAGE data.\n3.3 Meridional motions of absorption patches according to\nIRIS\nThe FoV of the imaging riometer installed at Kilpisjarvi\noverlaps with both STARE and CUTLASS viewing areas and\nis close to several IMAGE magnetometer stations (Fig. 1),\nwhich provides an excellent opportunity for studying the mo-\ntions in the riometer data for the auroral zone in conjunction\nwith radars and magnetometers. The event under study, how-\never, was characterized by a considerable level of solar radio\nnoise\/ionospheric scintillations. Fortunately, the IRIS beams\nclosest to the meridional direction of interest (indicated in\nFig. 1 by the open circles with numbers) were not signifi-\ncantly affected.\nFigure 5 is the absorption keogram at 23.0\u25e6 in 20-s reso-\nlution. The keogram longitude was chosen as a compromise\nbetween the proximity to the meridional direction of interest\n(see Fig. 1) and a requirement to stay within the IRIS FoV.\nAn additional reason is that this longitude is far enough from\nthe beams that were disturbed by the solar radiation. The\nIMF Bz grey-scale shading from Fig. 3 is reproduced on the\ntop of the diagram. The black contour corresponds to the\nboundary between westward and eastward electrojets J=0\nfrom Fig. 4.\nDuring the first (roughly) half of the period under study,\nthe displacement of the absorption contours seemed to be\nconsistent with the latitudinal variations of the eastjet pole-\nward border (black line). The reversal of the meridional\nmotion direction in absorption data from equatorward to\npoleward somewhat preceded the electrojet boundary mo-\ntion reversal and the first SNIT at \u223c13:10 UT (see the grey-\nscale bar above the main diagram). After \u223c14:30 UT, the\nabsorption dropped below the 0.2-dB level and in general\ndid not exhibit any consistent pattern in latitudinal shift.\nThe relatively strong absorption enhancement appeared at\n\u223c17:30 UT, soon after the last SNIT. From 17:37 to 17:52 UT\nthe contours were moving northward and then from 17:52\nto 17:56 UT equatorward, consistent with the motions of the\neastjet-westjet boundary.\n3.4 Coherent echoes: velocity of the meridional motions\nand Doppler velocity\nAnother objective of this study is to examine the spatial dis-\ntribution of the observed Doppler velocities at two radar fre-\nquencies and to find out if the velocities are consistent with\nthe magnetometer data. We also look at the velocity of the\necho band meridional displacement for different observa-\ntional directions in both the E- and F-regions. In Fig. 6 we\npresent the Doppler velocity RTI plots for various observa-\ntional directions. Similar to Fig. 3, the ragged black line is\nthe range location of the power maximum along each radar\nbeam, the heavy orange line is the best linear fit to this line\nfor the intervals of steady progression, and digits nearby in-\ndicate the velocity of echo band displacement along the radar\nbeam. With respect to the latter, one should note that in this\nsection, in addition to the echo band displacement velocity\ntowards\/away from the radar, we consider the irregularity\nDoppler velocity measured by the radar directly. To avoid\nany confusion we will refer to the former as \u201cthe echo band\n(displacement) velocity\u201d (Vband ) and to the latter as \u201cthe (ir-\nregularity) Doppler velocity\u201d. Note that both velocities are\nassumed to be positive (negative) for motions toward (away\nfrom) the radar.\nFor the STARE radar the aspect angle conditions are pro-\ngressively more favorable with the STARE beam number in-\ncrease; for beam 1, panel (b), the minimum achievable rec-\ntilinear aspect angle is \u22121.42\u25e6 (we indicated the range cor-\nresponding to this angle by the dashed red line), for beam\n4, panel (d), it is \u22120.44\u25e6, and for beam 8 it is zero. For the\nCUTLASS radar, the orthogonality condition is met closer\nto the radar because of refraction, typically at 400\u2013450 km,\nand we show these ranges determined from the model by the\nsolid red lines in panels (a), (c), and (e).\nThe diagrams in Fig. 6 have an appearance similar to the\none in Fig. 3, with \u201cW-like\u201d signatures for observations at\n12:00\u201315:30 UT and \u201cV-like\u201d signatures at 17:00\u201318:00 UT.\nAt HF and ranges of the F-region echoes (\u223c1000 km) the \u201cV-\nsignature\u201d without the bottom part is well seen in CUTLASS\nbeams 5 and 9, panels (c) and (e).\nAt VHF, the echo band velocity seems to be nearly con-\nstant for all directions, with perhaps a small increase with\nbeam number (Vband=107, 112, and 114 m\/s at STARE\nbeams 1, 4, and 8, respectively). Interestingly, the situation\nis the opposite for the E-region HF echoes, where the echo\nband velocity at closer ranges seems to be decreasing with\nbeam number (Vband=146, 122, and 100 m\/s at CUTLASS\nbeams 1, 5, and 9, respectively). The decrease is also seen\nfor the F-region HF echoes, Vband=366, 164, and 142 m\/s,\nalthough the first number is probably an overestimation.\nTurning to the Doppler velocity data, one can see that for\nthe first time interval (11:00\u201315:00 UT), the F-region irreg-\nularity velocity at farther ranges (>800 km) decreases with\nbeam number increase or, in other words, with the devia-\ntion from the expected E\u00d7B drift direction. The E-region\nHF Doppler velocity is, on the other hand, fairly constant; it\ndecreases with beam number but very slowly, remaining neg-\native for the entire interval and for almost all slant ranges. In\nsharp contrast with that, the VHF velocities could be either\nnegative or positive, depending on whether the echoes are\nclose to the range location of the power maximum. Thus,\nVHF echoes that are close to the power maxima location\n(denoted by the thin ragged line) predominately have nega-\ntive velocities (the cells filled with the solid color), consistent\nwith the expected electrojet eastward orientation for this time\nsector. However, there is a large set of VHF echoes with the\n1656 R. A.

Cells\nfilled with solid color (horizontal lines) correspond to the negative (positive) velocities.

The geographic\nlatitude along each radar beam is shown on the right axes.

Makarevitch et al.: Meridional motions of the afternoon radar aurora 1657\nopposite sign of Doppler velocity, so that at STARE beams 1\nand 8 the \u201cislands\u201d of the solid color are surrounded by the\nmuch larger \u201cseas\u201d of the echoes with positive Doppler ve-\nlocities. At easternmost STARE beam 8, the positive Doppler\nvelocities as high as 700 m\/s (the hatched red cells at 12:40\u2013\n13:40 UT, at slant ranges of more than 800 km) are observed.\nNotice that the echoes in the second band of VHF echoes at\n\u223c1000 km, at 17:30 UT, the presence of which we noted ear-\nlier (Fig. 3), also have positive Doppler velocities and they\nare quite high (\u223c500 m\/s).\nPositive Doppler velocities in general and large positive\nvelocities of 700 m\/s in particular are impossible to explain\nin terms of the usual sense of an irregularity velocity sign that\nis appropriate for the observations in the eastward electrojet.\nWe have to remember, however, that the second band of VHF\nechoes from the data presented in Fig. 4 was clearly associ-\nated with the westward electrojet, for which the Doppler ve-\nlocity is expected to be positive for our observational direc-\ntions. One can think then that all other echoes with positive\nvelocities (including the ones at \u223c800 km) originated from\nthe westward electrojet as well.\nThe equivalent electrojet current data presented in Fig. 4\nis a useful framework that can be used to resolve this is-\nsue. In Fig. 7a we compare the STARE velocities at beam 8\nfrom Fig. 6f and the IMAGE equivalent currents from Fig. 4.\nSince the IMAGE and STARE data refer to slightly different\nlocations, we compare them in terms of the PACE geomag-\nnetic latitude. The positive (negative) Doppler velocities are\nshown by the dark (light) grey cells. The boundary between\nthe currents of the opposite polarity J=0 is shown by the\nwhite contour. The red (yellow) area represents the range\ncells with the largest negative Doppler velocities (current in-\ntensities), with the farthest radar range limited by 720 km.\nOne can see in Fig. 7a a good general agreement between\nelectrojet currents and VHF Doppler velocities. The white\ncontour is close to the boundary between positive and nega-\ntive velocities. The hypothesis that the large positive veloci-\nties of more than 700 m\/s from 12:50 to 13:30 UT at farther\nranges occur within the westward electrojet also seems to\nfind its confirmation; the dark grey cells are generally above\nthe white contour. This is also the case for the second band\nof VHF echoes at 17:40 UT.\nThere are, however, several unexpected features in Fig. 7a.\nFirst, the cells with the positive Doppler velocities (dark\ngrey) equatorward of the islands of negative velocities (lat-\nitudes of 65\u25e6\u201366\u25e6) are all well within the eastward electro-\njet. At 13:10 UT, although the latter moves very close to the\nequatorward edge of the STARE observations (3\u223c=63\u25e6 N),\nthe first \u223c100 km in range of the STARE observations are\nstill within the eastward electrojet, while the radar records the\npositive Doppler velocities for all slant ranges with echoes\npresent. Even when the radar detects the echoes with nega-\ntive velocities (e.g. at \u223c12:50 and 13:30 UT), the white con-\ntour dividing the equivalent currents of opposite directions\nis somewhat poleward of the line that divides the echoes\nwith positive and negative Doppler velocities. For an inter-\nval when both Doppler velocities and currents intensities are\nlarge (13:00\u201314:30 UT), the areas with the largest STARE\nDoppler velocities (red) are located somewhat poleward of\nthe areas with the most intense eastward currents (yellow).\nThe CUTLASS E-region velocities, on the other hand,\nare predominantly consistent with the eastward electrojet,\nFig. 7b. Contrary to VHF measurements, the area with the\nlargest HF velocity (red) is equatorward of the most intense\ncurrents (yellow). The shift in the most negative velocities\nwith respect to the most intense eastward currents (equator-\nward at HF and poleward at VHF) is in agreement with a\nsimilar feature in the SNR data presented in Fig. 4.\nAnother way to look at the problem is to compare explic-\nitly the locations of the STARE and CUTLASS Doppler ve-\nlocity of the same sign and in Fig. 8 we show the plot for\nthe CUTLASS Doppler velocity (Fig. 6e) with the overlaid\nSTARE velocity plot. The grey-scale (color) scheme for the\nHF (VHF) Doppler velocity is shown on the right. Figure 8\nshows clearly that the gap between the E- and F-region CUT-\nLASS echoes was to a great extent covered by the STARE\nechoes and that there was a good correlation between the E-\nregion echo occurrences at both frequencies. The agreement\nbetween velocity signs, on the other hand, is rather poor; the\nCUTLASS velocities were predominantly negative, whereas\nthe STARE velocities (observed at the same range gates, say,\nat 500\u2013700 km) were either negative or positive. Once again,\nwe notice that the positive (red) VHF velocities equatorward\nof the areas with negative VHF velocities (yellow) were all\nlocated within the CUTLASS echo band (negative veloci-\nties). The meridional motions of the areas with negative ve-\nlocities at HF and VHF, however, were quite similar.\n4 Discussion\nIn this study, we considered meridional motions of echo\nbands observed by the STARE VHF and CUTLASS HF\ncoherent radars, electrojet currents inferred from the IM-\nAGE magnetometer data, and IRIS absorption, during a 7-h\nevent in the afternoon\/early-evening sector, with three abrupt\nnorthward turnings of the IMF each preceded by at least a\n60-min interval of southward IMF registered by the ACE\nmagnetic field instrument upstream of the magnetopause at\n\u223c13:10, 14:15, and 17:25 UT (the IMF data were shifted by\n45 min to account for the propagation time from the upstream\npoint to the ionosphere). The time variation of the AL in-\ndex indicated two periods of enhanced substorm-like activ-\nity, 11:00\u201316:00 UT and 16:00\u201318:00 UT, with the minima\nin AL index at \u223c13:00 and \u223c17:00 UT, although the qual-\nity of the AL index data was not fully conducive to the ex-\nact substorm onset time identification, since not every sta-\ntion recorded the data during the event. The SAMNET and\nIMAGE magnetometers recorded two periods with enhanced\nPi2 pulsation intensity, indicating the substorm onsets near\nthe first and third SNITs at \u223c13:10 and 17:25 UT. The geo-\nstationary satellite LANL 1984-084 detected three sharp in-\ncreases in both proton and electron fluxes on the nightside at\n13:08, 14:08, and 17:10 UT, indicating substorm-associated\n1658 R.

The analysis\nof the nightside POLAR UVI data revealed the UVI aurora\nintensification associated with the substorm expansive phase\nonset at 17:12 UT.\nDuring the event, the areas of the strong coherent\nbackscatter were moving in slant range both at VHF and HF,\nchanging the direction of meridional motion from equator-\nward to poleward several times. These changes, however,\nwere not quite simultaneous at VHF and HF; VHF echoes\npreceded the E-region HF echoes by \u223c10 min and slightly\ntrailed behind the F-region HF echoes. The speed of equator-\nward\/poleward progression was slightly decreasing with the\ndeviation from meridional direction at VHF and increasing\nat HF, both for the E- and F-region echoes.\n4.1 Radar aurora and auroral oval dynamics\nWe would first like to discuss the reasons for the observed\nchanges in the location of the strong backscatter on a global\nscale and interpret the noted earlier differences between the\nmeridional motions at HF and VHF.\nWe showed in Fig. 3 that the changes in the radar aurora\nmeridional motion direction from equatorward to poleward\ncorresponded remarkably well to the reversals of the IMF di-\nrection from southward to northward, even with some uncer-\ntainty in the IMF delay time. One quite obvious reason for\nsuch a correlation is the dayside reconnection. For a south-\nward IMF, the polar cap expands and the ionosphere adjusts\nto a new equilibrium with the auroral oval moving equator-\nward. For a northward IMF, the dayside reconnection cannot\nproceed anymore; the polar cap contracts and the auroral oval\nmoves poleward. One should note here that although an asso-\nciation between the dayside meridional motions and IMF Bz\npolarity has been reported in the past for the case of optical\naurora (e.g. Horwitz and Akasofu, 1977), whether a similar\nassociation exists between the IMF and the radar echo bands\nneeds to be investigated, since the optical and radar aurora\nare not necessarily related.\nOur observations of the radar echoes, although support-\ning this scenario for most of the event, are not in agreement\nwith it for observations during 13:20\u201314:00 UT, when the\nbackscatter area was clearly moving poleward, while IMF\nBz was negative. We think that this feature is related to the\nfact that the motions of the afternoon radar aurora, in partic-\nular, and the auroral oval, in general, were affected by the\nsubstorm processes on the nightside.\nAs already mentioned, the data from several instruments\nindicated a substorm onset at \u223c13:10 UT, in reasonable\nagreement with the first SNIT and the reversal of the merid-\nional motion direction from equatorward to poleward. It is\ntherefore reasonable to assume that the poleward progres-\nsion of the backscatter area after 13:20 UT under negative\nIMF Bz conditions was related to the poleward expansion\nof the auroral oval during the substorm expansion phase\n(Akasofu, 1964). One should note that most of the auro-\nral observations during the substorm have been made on the\nnightside, whereas our observations were performed in the\nafternoon\/early-evening sector (13\u201320 MLT). In this respect\nwe would like to point out that although the radar aurora\ndynamics during the substorm conditions has been studied\nextensively in the past on the nightside (Greenwald et al.,\n1973; Greenwald et al., 1975; Tsunoda et al., 1976; Baumjo-\nhann et al., 1978; Uspensky et al., 1983; Lewis et al., 1997;\nVoronkov et al., 1999), we report the first observations of\nthe poleward motion of the radar echoes in response to the\nsubstorm onset on the dayside, as early as 15 MLT. Impor-\ntantly, this feature was consistent with the data from all other\ninstruments. Thus, our observations suggest that the day-\nside dynamics in the 15 MLT sector can be controlled by the\nsubstorm processes in the midnight sector rather than by the\ndayside processes related to the reconnection near noon. The\nexact longitudinal extent of the region directly affected by\nthe IMF through the dayside reconnection needs to be inves-\ntigated further and this work is planned.\nThe equatorward progression of the coherent echoes be-\nfore the substorm onset at 13:10 UT can be then interpreted\nas associated with the expansion of the auroral oval dur-\ning the substorm growth phase. A similar feature was re-\nported recently at HF by Lewis et al. (1997) and Voronkov\net al. (1999). In both Lewis et al. (1997) and Voronkov et\nal. (1999), however, no poleward progression after the sub-\nstorm onset was observed. Several examples of the coher-\nent HF echoes moving in latitude synchronously with the\nproton aurora were presented (but not discussed in terms of\nsubstorm-associated auroral oval dynamics or IMF variation)\nby Jayachandran et al. (2002). We would like to empha-\nsize at this point that the observations of the equatorward\nprogression of the HF coherent echoes during the substorm\ngrowth phase presented in this study are also unique, since\nthey refer to the postnoon sector. In this sense, of special\ninterest are the results of Uspensky et al. (2001), who pre-\nsented the CUTLASS Finland radar observations of the F-\nand (later) E-region echoes \u223c3 h before the substorm onset\nin the postnoon\/early-evening sector. The relatively narrow\nbands (\u223c100 km in slant range) of HF echoes were slowly\ndrifting equatorward with the speed of \u223c30 m\/s. Uspensky\net al. (2001) associated the E-region CUTLASS echoes with\nthe equatorial boundary of the diffuse luminosity belt located\nequatorward of the auroral oval and equatorial progression of\nthese echoes with the diurnal rotation of the auroral oval; in\nthe evening sector of the ionosphere the motion of the equa-\ntorial boundary is expected to be equatorward. In our ob-\nservations, the speed of equatorward progression was greater\n(\u2265100 m\/s), almost certainly related to more disturbed con-\nditions during the event.\nIn Sect. 3.4 we demonstrated that the speed of the echo\nband equatorial progression was larger at HF and that it was\ndifferent for various HF beams. For both E- and F-region HF\nechoes, the echo band velocity Vband was decreasing with\nbeam number, implying that the echo band displacement ve-\nlocity vector was directed roughly along the meridian as one\nwould expect for the equatorward expanding auroral oval.\nThe variation of the echo band velocity for the STARE ob-\nservational directions was small, so that the velocity decrease\n1660 R. A. Makarevitch et al.: Meridional motions of the afternoon radar aurora\nwith beam number was most likely just an apparent effect due\nto the uncertainties of the estimates.\nThe echo band velocity changes with azimuth at HF were,\nhowever, quite significant. We think that this effect is a con-\nsequence of HF ray bending in the course of the radio wave\npropagation to the irregularities and back, as discussed be-\nlow. The broad ionospheric region with enhanced electron\ndensity and electric field moving equatorward will be first\ndetected by an HF radar at farther ranges as F-region echoes,\nthen by a VHF radar at lower E-region heights at somewhat\ncloser ranges, and, finally, by an HF radar in the E-region,\nFig. 2a. Meridional motion of the large-scale ionospheric en-\nhancement would result in meridional displacement of echo\nbands, which is consistent with the data presented in Fig. 3,\nwhich suggests that the reversal in the meridional motion di-\nrection occurs in the described above succession. The obser-\nvations of the F-region and the observations of the E-region\nat HF at ranges much closer than at VHF are only possible\ndue to the large ray bending at HF. As the ionospheric en-\nhancement migrates closer or farther from the radar, it moves\nessentially along the straight VHF radar beam, while at HF\nthe ray is curved and hence the echo band velocity along the\nHF radar beam would be larger, even though the \u201ctrue\u201d ve-\nlocity of the echo band, that is the velocity of the magnetic\nflux tube crossings, is the same, Fig. 2a. This implies that the\nlarger echo band displacement velocities at HF as compared\nto VHF is most likely an apparent effect.\nA similar argument can be put forward as an explanation\nof the stronger azimuthal dependence of the echo band veloc-\nity at HF. The amount of bending of the radar beam depends\nupon the azimuth of observations. We can qualitatively es-\ntimate how this would affect our observations using the pre-\nsentation of Fig. 1, which shows two types of the aspect angle\nisolines: the thin black curves represent the rectilinear aspect\nangle lines (\u03b1=\u22122\u25e6,\u22121\u25e6, and 0\u25e6) and the heavy black curve\n\u03b1=0\u25e6 indicates the perfect aspect angle line with refraction\ntaken into account. Importantly, the azimuthal variation of\nthe range distance between the heavy curve and, say, the bot-\ntommost thin curve (\u03b1=\u22122\u25e6), gives a sense of the amount\nof the ray bending as a function of radar look direction.\nThus, for example, for the low-number beams this distance\nis much larger than for the high-number beams, meaning that\nrefraction is more significant at low-number beams, which, in\nturn, signifies that the apparent velocity along the radar beam\nwould be larger for directions away from the meridian, con-\nsistent with the data presented in Fig. 6. We hence conclude\nthat the difference between the azimuthal variations of the\necho band displacement velocity at HF and VHF is simply a\nconsequence of larger refraction at HF.\nWith respect to the comparative ability of the HF and VHF\nradars to detect the auroral echoes and to monitor the auroral\noval dynamics, one has to consider the meridional motions\nas they are observed by different instruments, including co-\nherent radars at significantly different frequencies (12 and\n144 MHz in our study). The CUTLASS radar, primarily de-\nsigned to monitor the large-scale convection patterns in the\nhigh-latitude F-region, in our observations detected E-region\nechoes almost simultaneously with the STARE radar, Fig. 8.\nThe spatial coverage of the two radars was different, with the\nmost intense VHF echoes observed in the gap between E-\nand F-region HF echoes. The reversal in the meridional mo-\ntion direction of the E-region HF echoes associated with the\nsubstorm onset occurred a few minutes later as compared to\nthe corresponding reversals inferred from the VHF radar and\nmagnetometer data. Another important implication of this\nstudy is the potential overestimation of the echo band pro-\ngression speed at HF as compared to VHF, due to the radar\nbeam curvature.\nDifferent aspect angle conditions at two radar frequen-\ncies were most likely the reason for the significant equator-\nward shift of the HF E-region echo band. Thus, in Fig. 4\nthe location of the most intense irregularities as observed by\nVHF radar is systematically (100\u2013200 km) poleward of the\nstrongest HF echoes in the E-region. In Fig. 8, the areas with\nthe most negative VHF velocities are also located poleward\nof those at HF.\nIf one considers the relationship between electrojet cur-\nrents and radar echoes, an agreement between the strongest\nVHF echoes and most intense currents was quite good,\nFig. 4. There was some poleward shift in the VHF echoes\nduring the intervals when the most intense currents were lo-\ncated closer to the radar (e.g. at \u223c13 UT), which is again\nprobably related to more favorable aspect conditions at VHF\nat large slant ranges (see also next section). The boundaries\nbetween electrojet currents and VHF Doppler velocities of\nthe opposite polarity were also located close to each other,\nFig. 7a. The difference in range between these boundaries\nwas most pronounced near the substorm onset at\u223c13:10 UT,\nwith the electrojet currents typically reversing at slightly far-\nther ranges. Similar comparison between the electrojet cur-\nrents and HF velocities shows that the E-region echo band\nat HF was located within the eastward electrojet, consistent\nwith the sign of HF velocities, Fig. 7b. The meridional mo-\ntions of the boundary between electrojets of the opposite po-\nlarity were well synchronized with those of the absorption\npatches during the first half of the interval under study, Fig. 5.\n4.2 Irregularity Doppler velocity and electrojet direction\nAnother major issue considered in this study is the relation-\nship between the Doppler velocity of coherent echoes and the\nionospheric electric field\/electrojet current. In the F-region,\nthe dominant irregularity generation mechanism is the gradi-\nent drift (G-D) instability and the irregularity phase velocity\nis simply equal to that of the background plasma convection\nor E\u00d7B drift. In the E-region, the situation is much more\ncomplicated. For observations at large angles with respect to\nthe background drift of electrons V e0, the secondary waves\ngenerated through the nonlinear cascade of energy from the\nprimary two-stream or G-D waves, are often assumed to\npropagate with the velocity of primaries given by\nV = k\u02c6 \u00b7 V e0 +9V i0\n1+9 , (1)\nR. A. Makarevitch et al.: Meridional motions of the afternoon radar aurora 1661\nwith\n9 = \u03bde\u03bdi\nei\n(cos2 \u03b1 + \n2\ne\n\u03bd2e\nsin2 \u03b1). (2)\nHere k\u02c6 is the unit wave vector k\/k; V e0(V i0) is the electron\n(ion) drift velocity; \u03b1 is the off-orthogonal magnetic aspect\nangle; \u03bde, \u03bdi, e, and i are collision and gyrofrequencies of\nthe electrons and ions, respectively.\nSince in the E-region i\u001c\u03bdi , the electron background\ndrift dominates, so that for the westward convecting plasma\nflow appropriate for the MLT sector under study (13:00\u2013\n20:00 MLT), the E-region Doppler velocity should be nega-\ntive for the radar beams looking more westward (e.g. STARE\nbeam 1) and close to zero at perpendicular to the flow direc-\ntions (STARE beam 8).\nIn Fig. 6 the Doppler velocity is indeed negative for the\nslant ranges close to the power maximum location (islands\nof solid color). The latter, however, was not maximized at a\nrange close to the minimum aspect angle range shown by the\nred lines and this was also the case for the Doppler velocity,\nthough Eqs. (1\u20132) predict that the phase velocity should be\nmaximized at perfect (if it is achievable) aspect angle and\ndecrease with the aspect angle increase.\nMoreover, for STARE beam 8 (Fig. 6f), that is for radar\nbeams looking perpendicular to the flow, we observed an in-\nteresting feature; velocity was positive at farther ranges and\nvery large, up to +700 m\/s, in disagreement with the sense\nof westward drifting plasma (eastward current flow). We\nthen compared the STARE Doppler velocity with the IM-\nAGE equivalent currents (Fig. 7a) and found that these large\npositive Doppler velocities were recorded within the west-\nward electrojet.\nTo interpret large velocity magnitudes of more than\n700 m\/s within the westward electrojet, however, is not that\neasy. We think that the combination of two effects, namely\nthe aspect angle conditions for the radar directions of interest\nand electric field gradients are responsible for the observed\nsignificant Doppler velocity variation with range.\nThe large positive Doppler velocities were observed only\nfor the easternmost STARE beams 7 and 8. For these di-\nrections, as we noted earlier, the orthogonality condition can\nbe reached at two sets of ranges with relatively good aspect\nangles of the order of 0.5\u25e6 between 700\u20131200 km and with\nquickly decreasing aspect angles up to \u22122\u25e6 at closer ranges\n500\u2013700 km. One can state that the aspect angle conditions\nat farther ranges corresponding to the westward electrojet are\nmuch more favorable than at closer ranges (eastward electro-\njet) for these directions.\nThe latitudinal distribution of the equivalent current den-\nsity under the assumption of the plasma density homogene-\nity, on the other hand, indicates corresponding latitudinal\nvariation of the plasma drift\/electric field with the direction\nreversal in the latter occurring near the range of the Doppler\nvelocity sign reversal. We illustrated this feature in Fig. 2b\nthat shows the areas with the gradually changing electric field\nintensity (to the left and to the right from the white inclined\nstripe). The electrojet current at \u223c100 km is shown schemat-\nically by the circles with dots and crosses inside; it is directed\nto the east (west) for the area located southward (northward)\nfrom the white stripe denoting the boundary between the\nelectrojets of the opposite polarity.\nThe large positive Doppler velocities were observed only\nduring the interval for which the westward electrojet was ob-\nserved very close to the radar (e.g. at\u223c13:30 UT), which can\nimply that during this interval the radar probed (at farthest\nranges) the areas with the most intense electric field. Thus,\nin Fig. 2b the radar would probe the darkest area to the right\n(poleward) from the white stripe when the white stripe (to-\ngether with adjacent grey areas) would move the farthest to\nthe left (equatorward).\nImportantly, since the aspect angle conditions are better at\nthe far ranges (where the westward electrojet was developed)\nthan at short ranges (where the eastward electrojet was devel-\noped), the latitudinal variation and direction reversal of the\nelectric field stipulate significantly higher Doppler velocities\nin the westjet as compared to the simultaneous eastjet ob-\nservations, even if the electric field intensity itself is smaller\nin the westjet (as suggested by Fig. 4). Being directly pro-\nportional to the convection velocity\/electric field and quickly\ndecreasing with the aspect angle through Eqs. (1\u20132), the\nDoppler velocity variation with latitude\/range is determined\nby the combination of these two factors.\nAlthough no electric field measurements were available\nfor the interval 12:30\u201313:30 UT when large positive veloc-\nities were observed, the DMSP ion drift measurements of\nthe convection velocity for three passes over the FoV (F13:\n14:18\u201314:21 UT, F14: 17:52\u201317:56 UT, and F15: 17:44\u2013\n17:48 UT) during the event generally support the hypothe-\nsis of the electric field\/convection gradual decrease with lat-\nitude, direction reversal, and again gradual increase towards\nthe magnetic pole. In Fig. 1 we show the ion drift-meter data\nfrom one Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP)\npass over the near radars\u2019 FoV during the interval under\nstudy. Here the black vectors are the cross-track ion drift ve-\nlocity. The scale of vectors is indicated in the top right corner\nof the diagram. Data from a DMSP altitude of 810 km were\nprojected to an E-region height of 110 km along the PACE\nmagnetic field lines. For the other two passes, the zonal con-\nvection reversal latitudes were also found to be in reasonable\nagreement with the latitudes of the eastjet poleward bound-\nary.\nThe other interesting Doppler velocity feature noticed in\nFig. 7a was that the STARE radar recorded small positive\nvelocities for a large number of radar cells. These small pos-\nitive Doppler velocities are impossible to explain by the dif-\nferent direction of the plasma flow, since some of them were\ndefinitely within the eastjet for which the l-o-s component of\nthe flow is expected to be negative, especially for more zon-\nally directed beams such as STARE beam 1. We think that\nthe STARE velocity measurements for these areas might not\nrepresent general trends, since both the echo power and elec-\ntrojet intensity was low. As mentioned, in this study we used\nthe standard double-pulse STARE velocity data, which, as\n1662 R. A. Makarevitch et al.: Meridional motions of the afternoon radar aurora\ndemonstrated by Uspensky et al. (2004), under certain con-\nditions can somewhat underestimate the true Doppler veloc-\nity (inferred from the ACF data similar to the SuperDARN\nradars). Moreover, according to Uspensky et al. (2004) (see\ntheir Fig. 2), when the backscatter power (and multi-pulse\nDoppler velocity) was low the STARE Finland double-pulse\nvelocity changed its sign, becoming slightly positive for east-\nward electrojet flow.\nInterestingly, the E-region CUTLASS observations in the\nareas collocated with those of small positive STARE veloci-\nties (500\u2013700 km) showed predominantly negative Doppler\nvelocities for almost the entire period (except for the last\n80 min), indicating the \u201cproper\u201d direction of the flow,\nFigs. 6a, c, e. The Doppler velocity at HF was neverthe-\nless smaller compared to that at VHF when the area with\nstrong VHF echoes (or negative velocities) was sufficiently\nclose in range to allow the meaningful comparison (as, for\nexample, near 12:45 or 14:00 UT). The Doppler velocity at\nHF was typically less than 300 m\/s, and it did not change\nsign along the radar beam. HF echoes with unusually small\nDoppler velocities were reported previously by Makarevitch\net al. (2002) and Milan et al. (2003) and hypothesized to be\nthe scatter from the bottom of an unstable E-layer, where the\nDoppler velocity is depressed because of the enhanced 9-\nfactor in Eq. (1) due to larger collision frequencies with neu-\ntrals, Eq. (2).\nIn both Makarevitch et al. (2002) and Milan et al. (2003),\nhowever, no electric field measurements near the HF scat-\nter area were available. In our observations, simultaneous\nSTARE velocities were quite high (up to 500 m\/s at\u223c600 km\nin Fig. 6d), therefore, HF Doppler velocity limited in mag-\nnitude is unlikely to be caused by the small electric field in-\ntensity. The Doppler velocity at HF was featured recently\nin another study (Makarevitch et al., 2004), where the same\nconclusion was reached on the basis of the simultaneous F-\nand E-region CUTLASS observations during the event when\nthe DMSP drift-meter measurements did not show any sig-\nnificant latitudinal variation of the convection component.\nTherefore, we will not discuss this issue any further, but note\nthat the simultaneous HF\/VHF observations provide yet an-\nother argument in support of this conclusion.\n4.3 Absorption patch velocity\nUnder the conditions of strong horizonal electric field the E-\nregion plasma can be heated by the unstable plasma waves\ngenerated through the electrojet instabilities (Schlegel and\nSt.-Maurice, 1981). This E-region heating could also lead to\nan increase in the CNA, since absorption is proportional to\n\u03bde, which for the typical E-region heights increases with the\nelectron temperature Te as\u221d T 1\/2e (e.g. Kelley, 1989, p. 462).\nFollowing this idea, Stauning (1984) introduced a new class\nof riometer events for observations in the polar cap, where\nrelatively small absorption enhancements (patches) associ-\nated with heating could be easily distinguished from the ab-\nsorption due to the particle precipitation that is responsible\nfor a bulk of CNA events. Later, Stauning et al. (1995) at-\ntributed the polar progressing disturbances in both magne-\ntometer and riometer data in the polar cap to the electron\nheating associated with the By-related disturbances in the\nelectrojet current system. One should note that the above\ninterpretation is remarkably different from the more widely\naccepted notion that the auroral precipitation of the ener-\ngetic (>15 keV) electrons is responsible for the formation of\nabsorption patches (see, for example, the recent review by\nStauning, 1996), which implies that the latter should move\neither with theE\u00d7B drift (Hargreaves, 1970; del Pozo et al.,\n2002) or with significantly larger velocities during the sub-\nstorm expansion phase (Nielsen, 1980; del Pozo et al., 2002).\nDuring the first half of the period under study, the absorp-\ntion features moved in the meridional direction with veloci-\nties that were very close to those observed in the radar aurora\nand equivalent currents, Fig. 5, Vabs\u223c=Vband\u223c100 m\/s. The\nDoppler velocity measured by the coherent radars near the\nIRIS FoV (r\u223c800 km) was, on the other hand, significantly\nlarger; for example, at\u223c12:10 UT the STARE radar observed\nE-region velocities of \u223c500 m\/s, with similar F-region ve-\nlocities recorded by CUTLASS, Figs. 6e, f, which implies\nthat the meridional motion velocity of absorption patches in\nour observations was different from the convection compo-\nnent, but comparable to that of the coherent echo bands and\nelectrojet currents. One can then assume that the absorption\npatches in our event were moving together with the areas of\nenhanced electric field in the E-region rather than with the\nconvecting magnetic field lines and that the CNA enhance-\nments were caused mostly by the heating associated with the\nlarge horizontal electric fields.\nIn our opinion, the observations of the auroral riometer\nabsorption presented in this study are thus more consistent\nwith the electron heating mechanism (or Electron Heating\nAbsorption (EHA) type in classification of Stauning, 1996)\nthan with the D-region electron precipitation idea. In this\nsense the results of the present study are more reminiscent of\nthose of Stauning (1984) and Stauning et al. (1995) than, for\nexample, of del Pozo et al. (2002). There are, however, sev-\neral important differences between this study and Stauning et\nal. (1995). First of all, the electric field that caused the ab-\nsorption enhancements in our case was the electric field as-\nsociated with the background auroral convection rather than\nwith the local convection flow enhancements. The motion of\nthe absorption patches was synchronized with the meridional\ndisplacements of the auroral oval rather than with the polar\nprogressing By-related disturbances in the polar cap and ve-\nlocity was much smaller in our case (100 m\/s versus 1 km\/s).\n5 Summary and conclusions\nThe presented observations of the radar aurora at two fre-\nquencies (12 and 144 MHz), electrojet currents, and riome-\nter absorption during a 7-h event in the afternoon sector\n(13\u201320 MLT) showed synchronous, to a first approximation,\nmeridional motions of the areas of strong HF and VHF\ncoherent backscatter, intense equivalent electrojet currents,\nR. A. Makarevitch et al.: Meridional motions of the afternoon radar aurora 1663\nand enhanced radio wave absorption with the speed of the\npoleward-equatorward progression of the order of 100 m\/s.\nThe reversals of the meridional motion direction were al-\nmost coincident in time with the IMF Bz reversals; the mo-\ntion direction was equatorward (poleward) for the southward\n(northward) IMF, consistent with the polar cap expansion\n(contraction) associated with the reconnection processes on\nthe dayside. On one occasion, however, the poleward pro-\ngression continued after the southward IMF turning, shortly\nafter various instruments registered the substorm onset coin-\ncident with the sudden northward IMF turning, which sug-\ngested that the observed meridional motions near 15 MLT\nwere primarily related to the auroral oval dynamics during\nthe substorm triggered by the change in the IMF conditions.\nThe speed of meridional motion did not change much with\nthe observational direction at VHF while it was increasing\nwith the deviation from meridional direction at HF. This dif-\nference was attributed to a stronger radio ray bending at\n12 MHz, with the implication that the progression velocity\nof the areas with irregularities could be overestimated when\nprobed by an HF radar. An important feature linked to in-\ndicators of substorm onsets is that the reversal in meridional\nmotion direction associated with the substorm onset was ob-\nserved at HF a few minutes after that at VHF.\nThe close association between the radar aurora at VHF and\nelectrojet currents discovered in the 1970s has been reexam-\nined in this study on the basis of simultaneous HF and VHF\nradar data. We confirm that the meridional dislocation of the\necho bands at both HF and VHF is well correlated with that\nof the electrojet currents. A new finding is that at both fre-\nquencies the echo bands did not coincide with the intense\ncurrents. At HF, the former were typically observed 100\u2013\n200 km equatorward of the latter, whereas at VHF the situa-\ntion was the opposite, with the former located a few tens of\nkm poleward of the latter, which is most likely the result of\nthe significantly different aspect angle conditions at 12 and\n144 MHz. The HF and VHF radars monitored different but\nadjacent areas of the ionosphere and hence can be consid-\nered as complementary to each other in terms of the spatial\ncoverage.\nWe also considered in some detail the Doppler velocity at\n12 and 144 MHz in the context of the electrojet current sys-\ntem and discovered several unexpected features. At VHF,\nhigh positive Doppler velocities (up to +700 m\/s), inconsis-\ntent with the expected electrojet direction for the time of\nmeasurements, were observed for the period when echoes\nwere as shortest ranges. The more detailed analysis revealed\nthat these unusual velocities were associated with the west-\nward electrojet current system excursion to lower latitudes\nnormally occupied by the eastward electrojet. At HF, the\nE-region Doppler velocities were found to be significantly\nlower than their F-region and VHF E-region counterparts,\nwith the maximum values of \u223c300 m\/s.\nFinally, we found that the velocity of the meridional mo-\ntions of absorption patches was close to that in the radar and\nmagnetometer data while being different from the Doppler\nvelocity measured at directions perpendicular to the flow and\nconcluded that the radio wave absorption enhancements of\nthe order of 0.4\u20130.5 dB observed during the event most likely\ndid not represent any significant particle deposition into the\nD-region but rather corresponded to the E-region heating by\nintense zonal auroral currents.\nAcknowledgements.
