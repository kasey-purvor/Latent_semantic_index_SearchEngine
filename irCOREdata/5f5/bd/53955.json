INTRODUCTION\nThe main aim of this paper is to present a systematic multi-\nobjective fuzzy modeling approach which can simultaneously \naccount for the interpretability of the rule-base and its \npredictive accuracy. Among the two main fuzzy modeling \nparadigms, viz. TSK [1] and Mamdani [2] FRBS, the latter is \nchosen as the main focus of this study due to its unique ability \nof expressing semantic meanings in its consequents. Generally \nspeaking, a FRBS is a static nonlinear mapping between its \ninputs and outputs [3], which can be formulated as follows: \u0734\u0bdc\u01e3 \u072b\u0742\u0003\u0754\u0b35\u0003\u0745\u074f\u0003\u0723\u0bdc\u0b35\u0003\u073d\u074a\u0740\u0003\u0754\u0b36\u0003\u0745\u074f\u0003\u0723\u0bdc\u0b36\u01e1\u01e5\u0003 \u01e1 \u073d\u074a\u0740\u0003\u0754\u0bdd\u0003\u0745\u074f\u0003\u0723\u0bdc\u0be1\u0003\u0736\u0744\u0741\u074a\u0003\u0755\u0bdc \u0d4c \u073c\u0bdc\nwhere, \u0723\u0bdc\u0bdd is ith linguistic value (fuzzy set) for the jth linguistic \nvariable \u0754\u0bdd  defined over the universe of discourse \u053c\u0bdd ; the \nfunction \u07e4\u0bba\u0cd4\u0cd5\u123a\u0754\u0bdd\u123b associated with \u0723\u0bdc\u0bdd  that maps  \u053c\u0bdd  to [0, 1] is \nthe corresponding membership function; Ri  represents the ith \nrule in the rule base, and \u0755\u0bdc  is the output of the ith rule. \nTypically, \u073c\u0bdc can be the function of the inputs or the linguistic \nvalue of the output, which differentiate FRBS into TSK (the \nformer) and Mamdani (the latter) FRBS. Depending on the \nform of the function, TSK FRBS can be further divided into \nSingleton ones (Zi is the zero order function of the inputs) and \nlinear TSK FRBS (Zi is the linear function of the inputs). In \nsome sense, Singleton FRBS share the basic feature of \nMamdani FRBS if one considers the singleton consequents as a \nspecial type of fuzzy sets.  \n In this paper, a systematic multi-objective Mamdani fuzzy \nmodeling approach is proposed and is organized as follows: \nsection II shortly reviews the existing Evolutionary Algorithms \n(EAs)-based approaches for improving fuzzy model\u2019s \ninterpretability; section III introduces the concept of multi-\nobjective optimization (MO) and the developed three-stage \nmodeling procedure; special attentions have been given to the \nsecond modeling stage, and the discussions of the variable \nlength coding scheme and the rule alignment which are closely \nassociated with the problem of the so-called \u2018unordered set of \nrules\u2019 [4] due to the changeable rule-base structure and the \nblind search process; experimental results for predicting \nTensile Strength (TS) of alloy steels are presented in section IV \nto validate the proposed modeling scheme; finally, conclusions \nare given in section V.  \nII. THE REVIEW OF EAS-BASED FUZZY MODELING \nOriginated from Karr\u2019s work [5], the GA approach was \ninitially utilized to adjust the parameters of membership \nfunctions, which makes no significant difference from other \nlearning paradigms. The real significance of employing EAs \nfor optimizing FRBS comes from EAs\u2019 flexibility in terms of \nbeing able to encode and evolve almost every component of \nFRBS. Such flexibility offers a solution so that one can take \ninto account the interpretability (structure) and the performance \nof the FRBS in a more coherent way. Broadly speaking, there \ncurrently exist two different EA-based streams to tackle the \ninterpretability issues: the first stream is mainly concerned with \nthe linguistic modeling, in which a set of pre-specified fuzzy \npartitions are given a priori by experts or users (grid partition); \nthe task is then to find an optimal FRBS in terms of its \ncompactness and performance [6~8]; rule selection is a \ncommon approach that has been adopted in this line of \nresearch; the second stream generally takes the approximate \nProceedings of the 2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics\nSan Antonio, TX, USA - October 2009\n978-1-4244-2794-9\/09\/$25.00 \u00a92009 IEEE\n4203\nfuzzy models as the start point; hence, the task is to improve \nthe model\u2019s explanatory ability, which may have been lost \nduring the automatic learning process, through a set of \nsimilarity-driven simplification and parameter adjusting \noperations [9~13]. \nThe difference between the two streams is derived from the \ndifference of the problems that they are facing. In the linguistic \nmodeling stream, the target problems are normally associated \nwith classifications and low-dimensional function \napproximations; hence, the effect of the \u2018curse of \ndimensionality\u2019 due to the grid partition and the need for the \nparameter tuning due to the performance requirement are not \nserious issues. In the latter case, high-dimensional \napproximations are often the case; as a result, an approximate \nFRBS is a better choice to start with due to the accuracy and \ncompactness requirement. Within the second stream, EA-based \nmulti-objective fuzzy modeling has become a recent hotspot for \nfunction approximations due to its ability of producing a set of \ncompromised FRBSs [10~13]. However, this is a rather new \ndeveloping area with several other issues to be addressed. \nAmong which, the following two are the most important: 1) \nmost well-known multi-objective optimization algorithms used \nin the fuzzy modeling, e.g. NSGA II [14], are originally \ndesigned to solve real-valued problems; in order to use such \ntype of real-valued algorithms to simultaneously optimize the \nrule base structure and the parameters of membership \nfunctions, similarity-driven simplifications are normally \nselected as the mutation operators for the former [10~11], and \nthe heuristic variations (crossover) are proposed for the latter \n[10~13]; however, the search power of these optimization \nalgorithms relies heavily on their original variation operators; \nother components of the algorithms are mainly used to \nadvocate diversity and elitism; without using the original \nvariation operators, even if the general framework is kept it is \nlikely that the search capability, in terms of the real-valued \n(parameter) optimization part, may be compromised; 2) the \nreason behind the use of the heuristic variation operators for the \nparameter optimization is that the structure optimization leads \nto individuals with different sizes, e.g. rule base length, which \nmakes conventional variation operators (e.g. operators that \ndepend on the interaction between individuals) invalid. Hence, \nnew techniques that can cope with the variable length coding \nand can facilitate the use of the original variations operators are \nneeded.  \nWith the aim of solving high-dimensional approximation \nproblems, this paper falls into the second stream. To address \nthe above two issues, we extend the research in [15~16], which \nhas been shown to be effective for real-valued MO, to a \nMamdani fuzzy modeling scenario, and propose a new distance \nindex [17] that is able to cope with the variable-length \nindividuals and unconstraint optimization. The above features \nplus the newly proposed BEP updating formulas for the \nMamdani FRBS are the main contributions of this paper.  \nIII. A THREE-STAGE IMMUNE MULTI-OBJECTIVE MAMDANI \nFUZZY MODELLING APPROACH\nA. The Definition of MO Problems  \nMany real-world problems are inherently of a multi-\nobjective nature with often conflicting issues. Generally, MO\u2019s \naim is to minimize\/maximize the vector function (1) subject to \nJ inequality and K equality constraints (2): \u0742\u123a\u0754\u123b \u0d4c \u123e \u0b35\u0742\u123a\u0754\u123b\u01e1 \u0b36\u0742\u123a\u0754\u123b\u01e1 \u01e5 \u01e1 \u0be0\u0742\u123a\u0754\u123b\u123f\u0bcd\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u123a\u0373\u123b:\u0743\u0bdd\u123a\u0754\u123b \u0d52 \u0372\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0746 \u0d4c \u0373\u01e1\u01e5 \u072c\u01e2\u0003\u0003\u0744\u0bde\u123a\u0754\u123b \u0d4c \u0372\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0747 \u0d4c \u0373\u01e1\u01e5\u072d\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u123a\u0374\u123b\nwhere \u0754 \u0d4c \u123e\u0754\u0b35\u01e1 \u0003\u0754\u0b36\u01e1 \u01e5 \u0754\u0be1\u123f\u0bcd \u05d0 \u05ce  is the vector of decision \nvariables and \u05ce  is the feasible region. Instead of a unique \nsolution, a set of trade-off solutions, or the so-called Pareto \nsolutions, is found in the context of MO. The expression of \nthese Pareto solutions in the objective space forms \u2018Pareto \nfront\u2019. Fig. 1 shows the Pareto front in a biobjective fuzzy \nmodeling scenario where two competing objectives, viz. the \npredictive error and the rule-base complexity, are minimized \nsimultaneously. The aim is to find a set of \u2018Pareto FRBSs\u2019 as \nclose to the Pareto front as possible. By finding the set of \nsolutions humans can understand the problem in a much \ngreater depth, and finally a single optimal solution to a specific \nscenario is finally selected and applied. As mentioned in [10], \nthis results in a low human intervention during the modeling \nprocess.   \nB. A Three-stage Immune Multi-objective Mamdani Fuzzy \nModeling Approach \nNature-inspired optimization algorithms, such as Genetic \nAlgorithms (GA), have been found to be very promising for \nMO problems due to the parallel search for a set of solutions. \nArtificial Immune Systems (AIS) are another instance among \nsuch computing paradigms. In [15~16], the authors synergized \nfour immunological models and have proved that a multi-stage \nimmune MO procedure can greatly reduce the computational \nload of the whole search process. The first stage of the \nproposed MO procedure emulates the vaccination process, and \nthe second stage is based on the clonal selection and network \nhypothesis [15]. Based on the immune inspired MO algorithm, \nin [17], the authors further proposed a three-stage Immune \nMulti-objective Singleton Fuzzy Modeling (IMOFM_S) \napproach, in which, the first two stages function exactly the \nsame as the first step of the multi-stage immune MO \nprocedure to extract the so-called \u2018vaccine model\u2019. Fig. 2 \nshows the framework of the IMOFM_S, in which Activation \ncalculates the affinity (fitness) for each Antibody (solution) so \nthat an adaptive number of clones can be produced; Affinity \nmaturation mutates the clones so that more search space can \nbe explored; Reselection selects good candidate solutions from \nthe combined parents and clones to provide a selection \npressure to effectively drive the candidate solutions towards \nthe Pareto front over many iteration steps; Network \nsuppression is used to regulate the dynamics of the population \nso that it can adapt to the problem. Although immune \nFig. 1.  Pareto front in a biobjective fuzzy modeling case.\n4204\nalgorithms accidentally resemble some characteristics of \nGenetic Algorithms, a more efficient search could be induced \nsince the population is adaptive. \nAlthough, such a framework was initially proposed for the \nsingleton fuzzy modeling, it is not restricted to such an \nimplementation. This paper extends the framework to its \nMamdani version by replacing the singleton consequents with \nbell-shape membership functions. A set of new BEP updating \nformulas are thus developed to account for such changes, \nwhich forms the baseline for substituting the second modeling \nstage in IMOFM_S. It is worth mentioning that in the \nMamdani implementation the merging operation takes place \nnot only in the premises but also in the consequents. In \nfollowing space, the three-stage Immune Multi-objective \nMamdani Fuzzy Modeling (IMOFM_M) approach is \nintroduced with the special emphasis on the second modeling \nstage. Special attentions are also given to the variable length \ncoding scheme and its concomitant problem, viz. \u2018unordered \nset of rules\u2019, because it is somehow overlooked in the past \nresearch. Interested readers are referred to [15~17] for more \ndetails regarding the immune inspired MO algorithm and the \nfirst and the third modeling stages.  \n1) First stage: An Evolutionary Based Clustering \nAlgorithm-G3Kmeans \nClustering is incorporated into fuzzy modeling especially \nwhen numerical data reflects a high dimensionality mapping \nbetween input and output spaces. The purpose of clustering is \nto extract the relationship between independent system \nvariables so that the initial fuzzy structure with only a \nconservative number of rules can be obtained. In [17], an \nevolutionary based clustering algorithm-G3Kmeans, \nrepresenting the combination of G3PCX [18] and K-means is \nproposed. The purpose of such a combination is to utilize the \nglobal search capability of GA to find a set of cluster centers \nso that a within-cluster-distance criterion is minimized. By \ndoing so, the sensitivity to the initial settings is avoided in the \nfirst place, and more importantly a good global fuzzy partition \nis extracted, which can ease the optimization in the second \nmodeling stage. Interested readers about the detailed steps \nincluded in G3Kmeans are referred to [17]. As will be seen in \nthe next part, the Gaussian membership function is used for \nthe inputs in FRBS. In such a case, the identified cluster \ncenters C in the input dimensions correspond directly to the \ncenters of Gaussian membership functions. The spread of the \nGaussian membership function is obtained by first calculating \nthe U matrix as follows: \n)3(),(\n1\n1\n\u2212\n=\n\u00b8\u00b8\u00b9\n\u00b7\n\u00a8\u00a8\u00a9\n\u00a7\n\u2212\n\u2212\n= \u00a6\nk\nl lm\nim\nCX\nCX\nmiU\nWhere, kCCC ,..., 21  are k cluster centers, and U specifies the \ndegrees of data points belonging to each cluster center.  Spread \nj\ni\u03c3 is then calculated as follows: \n( )\n( )( ) )4(,2,1,log2max\n2\ntm\nmiU\nCx ji\nj\nmj\ni\n!=\n\u00b8\u00b8\n\u00b8\n\u00b9\n\u00b7\n\u00a8\u00a8\n\u00a8\n\u00a9\n\u00a7\n\u22c5\n\u2212\u2212\n=\u03c3\nwhere, j indicates the dimension of the spread for the ith\ncluster, t is the total number of data points. With centers and \nspreads obtained from the clustering algorithm, the Gaussian \nmembership function can be specified as follows: \n( ) )5(\n2\n1exp\n2\n\u00b8\u00b8\n\u00b8\n\u00b9\n\u00b7\n\u00a8\u00a8\n\u00a8\n\u00a9\n\u00a7\n\u00b8\u00b8\u00b9\n\u00b7\n\u00a8\u00a8\u00a9\n\u00a7 \u2212\n\u22c5\u2212= j\ni\nj\ni\nj\nj\nA\ncx\nxj\ni \u03c3\n\u00b5\n It is worth mentioning that G3Kmeans is operated on the \nproduct space of the inputs and output. Hence, after the first \nstage, a FRBS with the pre-specified number of rules is \nextracted from the numerical data with the input membership \nfunctions defined by (5). Instead of using Gaussian \nmembership functions, bell-shape membership functions are \nused for the consequents as described below: \n\u07e4\u0bbb\u0cd4\u123a\u0755\u123b \u0d4c \u0373\u0373 \u0d45 \u1246\u0755 \u0d46 \u073f\u0bdc\u0bec\u07ea\u0bdc\u0bec \u1247\u0b36\n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u123a\u0378\u123b\nwhere,\u0003\u07e4\u0bbb\u0cd4\u123a\u0755\u123bis the ith output membership function; \u073f\u0bdc\u0bec is the \nith cluster center on the output dimension, and \u07ea\u0bdc\u0bec is calculated \nusing eq. (4) on the output dimension. The reason behind the \nuse of bell-shape membership functions for the consequents is \nthat a closed form integral can be deducted in the \ndefuzzification step, which makes the defuzzification step \ndifferentiable and thus facilitates the deduction of a set of BEP \nparameter updating laws for fine tuning Mamdani FRBS.  \n2) Second stage: Refining the Initial Model with a \nConstriant BEP \nThe initial fuzzy model extracted from the first stage is not \noptimal from two perspectives: 1) the structure of FRBS is not \noptimal as far as the interpretability is concerned; 2) the \nmembership function parameters need to be tuned further. A \nconstrained back BEP algorithm is thus proposed to first \nimprove the accuracy of the initial FRBS so that a \u2018vaccine \nmodel\u2019 can be obtained for the next operation in the multi-\nobjective optimization stage.  As mentioned in [13], if the \ninitial population can be constructed using some heuristics, \nFig. 2.

If the \nGaussian membership functions are used for the premises and \nbell-shape membership functions for the consequents, a \nMamdani FRBS can be formulated as follows: \n\u0755\u0bd6\u0be5\u0bdc\u0be6\u0be3 \u0d4c \u03c3 \u073e\u0bdc \u0209 \u05ec \u07e4\u0bbb\u0de0\u0cd4\u123a\u0755\u123b \u0740\u0755\u0bec\u0bde\u0bdc\u0b40\u0b35\u03c3 \u05ec \u07e4\u0bbb\u0de0\u0cd4\u123a\u0755\u123b \u0740\u0755\u0bec\u0bde\u0bdc\u0b40\u0b35 \u0d4c\n\u03c3 \u073e\u0bdc \u0209 \u07e4\u0bdc\u123a\u073a\u123b \u0209 \u05ec \u07e4\u0bbb\u0cd4\u123a\u0755\u123b \u0740\u0755\u0bec\u0bde\u0bdc\u0b40\u0b35\u03c3 \u07e4\u0bdc\u123a\u073a\u123b \u0209 \u05ec \u07e4\u0bbb\u0cd4\u123a\u0755\u123b \u0740\u0755\u0bec\u0bde\u0bdc\u0b40\u0b35\u061d \u0755\u0bd6\u0be5\u0bdc\u0be6\u0be3\u123a\u073a\u0201\u07e0\u123b\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u123a\u0373\u0372\u123b\nwhere, bi is the center of area of the membership function \u07e4\u0bbb\u0cd4\u123a\u0755\u123b  and is the peak if such a membership function is \nsymmetric. \u05ec \u07e4\u0bbb\u0de0\u0cd4\u123a\u0755\u123b \u0740\u0755\u0bec  denotes the area under \u07e4\u0bbb\u0de0\u0cd4\u123a\u0755\u123b over \nthe output interval \u0755\u01e3 \u123e\u0755\u0bc5\u01e1 \u0755\u0bce\u123f  and \u05ec \u07e4\u0bbb\u0cd4\u123a\u0755\u123b \u0740\u0755\u0bec can be \ncalculated as below: \n\u0db1 \u07e4\u0bbb\u0cd4\u123a\u0755\u123b \u0740\u0755\u0bec \u0d4c \u07ea\u0bdc\u0bec \u1248\u073d\u074e\u073f\u0750\u073d\u074a \u1246\u0755\u0bce \u0d46 \u073e\u0bdc\u07ea\u0bdc\u0bec \u1247 \u0d46 \u073d\u074e\u073f\u0750\u073d\u074a \u1246\u0755\u0bc5 \u0d46 \u073e\u0bdc\u07ea\u0bdc\u0bec \u1247\u1249\u061d \u0743\u0d6b\u073e\u0bdc\u01e1 \u07ea\u0bdc\u0bec\u0d6f\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u123a\u0373\u0373\u123b\u07e0 \u0d4c \u0d6b\u073e\u0bdc\u01e1 \u07ea\u0bdc\u0bec\u01e1 \u073f\u0bdc\u0bdd\u01e1 \u07ea\u0bdc\u0bdd\u0d6f  is the parameter vector subject to the \nminimization of the mean square error. Using the BEP \ntechnique, a set of parameter update laws are derived in eqs. \n(12) ~ (16) for the Mamdani FRBS. If one compares the \nupdate laws in this paper with those developed in [17], one \nwill find that the width of the output membership function is \nalso included in eqs. (12) ~ (16). Since there are no constraints \non updating these parameters, during the course of the \noptimization, centres are likely to be placed outside the \nboundaries. Although this does not affect the ultimate \naccuracy of FRBS, it does cause confusion for the users when \nassigning linguistic labels, and more importantly it may violate \nthe search space defined in the next stage. Hence, in this work, \na constraint handling scheme is added, which checks the \nboundary violation for centres during each iteration step and \ndrive any violated centres back to the boundaries. The step \nsize\u03bb  and the gain of momentum term\u03b2 are all set to 0.035 in \nthis work without any loss of generality. \n3) Third stage: Multi-objective Mamdani Fuzzy Modeling  \na) Forming the objective functions \nTwo conflicting objective functions are formulated with \nthe first focusing on the prediction accuracy and the second on \nthe structure simplification as follows: \n\u0731\u073e\u0746\u0741\u073f\u0750\u0745\u0752\u0741\u0003\u0373\u01e3 \u0734\u072f\u0735\u0727 \u0d4c \u0003\u0da8\u03c3 \u0d6b\u0755\u0be3\u0be5\u0bd8\u0bd7\u0bdc\u0bd6\u0be7\u0bdc\u0be2\u0be1\u0334\u0be0 \u0d46 \u0755\u0be5\u0bd8\u0bd4\u0bdf\u0334\u0be0\u0d6f\u0b36\u0be7\u0be0\u0b40\u0b35 \u0750\u0731\u073e\u0746\u0741\u073f\u0750\u0745\u0752\u0741\u0003\u0374\u01e3 \u0725\u074b\u0749\u074c\u0748\u0741\u0754\u0745\u0750\u0755 \u0d4c \u0730\u074e\u0751\u0748\u0741 \u0d45 \u0730\u074f\u0741\u0750 \u0d45 \u0734\u072e\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u123a\u0373\u0379\u123b\nwhere,\u0755\u0be3\u0be5\u0bd8\u0bd7\u0bdc\u0bd6\u0be7\u0bdc\u0be2\u0be1\u0334\u0be0 and \u0755\u0be5\u0bd8\u0bd4\u0bdf\u0334\u0be0 are predicted and real outputs \nrespectively; Nrule is the number of fuzzy rules in FRBS; Nset\nis the total number of fuzzy sets; RL is the summation of the \nrule length of each rule.  \nb) Forming the initial population pool \nThe vaccine model elicited from the first two stages is used \nto seed the initial population pool, in which a set of initial \n4206\nFRBSs will be randomly generated around the original vaccine \nmodel using the following equations: \u0725\u0bdc\u0be1\u0bdc\u0be7\u0bdc\u0bd4\u0bdf\u0bdc\u0bdd \u0d4c \u07d9 \u0209 \u074e\u073d\u074a\u0743\u0741\u0bdd \u0209 \u074e\u073d\u074a\u0740\u074a \u0d45 \u0725\u0be9\u0bd4\u0bd6\u0bd6\u0bdc\u0be1\u0bd8\u0bdc\u0bdd\u0003\u0003\u07ea\u0bdc\u0be1\u0bdc\u0be7\u0bdc\u0bd4\u0bdf\u0bdc\u0bdd \u0d4c \u07da \u0209 \u074e\u073d\u074a\u0740\u074a \u0d45 \u07ea\u0be9\u0bd4\u0bd6\u0bd6\u0bdc\u0be1\u0bd8\u0bdc\u0bdd\u0003\u0725\u0bdc\u0be1\u0bdc\u0be7\u0bdc\u0bd4\u0bdf\u0bdc\u0bec \u0d4c \u07d9 \u0209 \u074e\u073d\u074a\u0743\u0741\u0bec \u0209 \u074e\u073d\u074a\u0740\u074a \u0d45 \u0725\u0be9\u0bd4\u0bd6\u0bd6\u0bdc\u0be1\u0bd8\u0bdc\u0bec\u0003\u07ea\u0bdc\u0be1\u0bdc\u0be7\u0bdc\u0bd4\u0bdf\u0bdc\u0bec \u0d4c \u07da \u0209 \u074e\u073d\u074a\u0740\u074a \u0d45 \u07ea\u0be9\u0bd4\u0bd6\u0bd6\u0bdc\u0be1\u0bd8\u0bdc\u0bec\n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u123a\u0373\u037a\u123b\n\u074e\u073d\u074a\u0743\u0741 \u0d4c \u008f\u008b\u0090\u123a\u0201\u0725\u0be9\u0bd4\u0bd6\u0bd6\u0bdc\u0be1\u0bd8 \u0d46 \u0bdf\u0737\u0bdc\u0be0\u0bdc\u0be7\u0201\u01e1 \u0201\u0725\u0be9\u0bd4\u0bd6\u0bd6\u0bdc\u0be1\u0bd8 \u0d46 \u072e\u0bdf\u0bdc\u0be0\u0bdc\u0be7\u0201\u123b\u0003\u0003\u123a\u0373\u037b\u123b\nwhere, randn is a random number within [0, 1]. \u074e\u073d\u074a\u0743\u0741 defines \nthe minimum interval between the center and its \ncorresponding upper \u0bdf\u0737\u0bdc\u0be0\u0bdc\u0be7  and lower \u072e\u0bdf\u0bdc\u0be0\u0bdc\u0be7  limits of input (or \nthe output) variable, whichever is smaller. The inclusion of \u074e\u073d\u074a\u0743\u0741 is to ensure that the newly generated centers are most \nlikely within the inputs\u2019 (or the output\u2019s) domains. Any \nviolation of the domains will be corrected by dragging those \ncenters (or consequents) back to the upper or lower limits, \nwhichever is closest. \u07d9 and \u07da are the user specified parameters \nwhich define how much different the newly generated FRBSs \nare from the original vaccine one in order to maintain a certain \ndiversity in the initial population, and is set to 0.2 and 0.1 in \nthis work with loss of generality. \nc) Variable length coding scheme \nEncoding scheme plays a vital role in all kinds of EA-\nbased optimization. As far as the multi-objective fuzzy \nmodeling is concerned, different encoding schemes have been \nproposed and can be broadly divided into two categories: 1) \nencoding based on the global data base (linguistic term set); 2) \nencoding based on the effective rule parameters. The former is \nmainly found within the linguistic modeling stream [6], [8]; \nWhile the latter is mainly found in the approximate modeling \nstream due to the lack of the global data base in the first place \n[10~12].  [7] and [13] represent the variants of the first \nencoding scheme, in which encoding comprises the structure \ncoding and the parameter (data base) coding. The structure \ncoding controls the \u2018on-and-off\u2019 of the genes in the parameter \ncoding.  \nThe drawback of using the first encoding scheme and its \nvariants is that it suffers the \u2018curse of dimensionality\u2019. In such \na case, the length of the chromosome grows exponentially \nwith the increased dimensions, which causes the difficulty for \nthe EAs as far as the search capability is concerned. A typical \nproblem associated with the variants is illustrated in Fig. 6 (a). \nSince most heuristic search methods rely on the interaction \nbetween individuals in the phenotypic space, which is the \nmajor thrust directing the search mechanism, an ineffective \nreal-valued optimization may be induced because some active \nparameter genes (grey ones) may interact with the inactive \nones (blank ones). Conversely, if only the effective rule \nparameters are included in the coding, a variable length coding \nscheme is inevitable. In [19], one of the first attempts of this \nkind for designing fuzzy controllers has been proposed. \nSimilar coding scheme can be found in [10~12]. Such a \nvariable length coding scheme, which only encodes effective \nrules, is also employed in this work to account for the \nefficiency of the search and the curse of dimensionality. Fig. 6 \n(b) and (c) give examples of how to encode FRBSs with the \ndifferent number of rules. \nGiven the variable length coding scheme and the \nunconstrained optimization, a concomitant effect of the so-\ncalled \u2018unordered sets of rules\u2019 [4] may occur, which may also \naffect the variation operators based on the interaction of \nindividuals. The effect of this is equivalent to combining the \nmother\u2019s gene for good vision and father\u2019s gene for curly hair \n[4].  Hence, an alignment procedure is required to align the \nclosest rules from different FRBSs in order to have a \nmeaningful interaction over the \u2018unordered sets of rules\u2019. \nAlthough this problem has been realized and solved early-on \nduring the development of the binary GA-based fuzzy \ncontroller, it was somehow overlooked in the development of \nthe real-valued GA-based fuzzy models. Hence, in this paper a \nnew distance index is proposed to calculate the affinity for the \nimmune algorithm in the activation step. This will facilitate \nthe use of the original effective search operator, viz. affinity \nmaturation.  The basic idea is to find the distance of the closest \nrules in different FRBSs rather than the distance of \ncorresponding rules. The mathematical description of the idea \nis as follows: \n( ) ( )\n)20(\n)21(\n)()()()(\n),(\n2\n12\n1\n22\n1\n11\n1\n11\nkkrl\nlRlRlRlR\nRRdist\nk\ni\nrl\nl\nCi\nj\ni\nk\nk\ni\nrl\nl\nCi\nk\ni\nj\nkj +\u22c5\n\u2212+\u2212\n=\n\u00a6\u00a6\u00a6\u00a6\n=\n=\n=\n=\nWhere,\nkj RR , are two FRBS with k1 and k2 rules; rl is the \nlength of the rule; 1Ci\nkR )( 2CijR represent the closest rule in kR\n)( jR  with respect to the i1th (i2th) rule in jR )( kR . The above \ndistance index is used to replace the one in the immune \ninspired MO algorithm for calculating the affinity (refer to \n[15~16] for more details about the affinity calculation). \nd) Model Simplification \nA model simplification step is added into the immune MO \nalgorithm with the aim of removing the redundancy both in \nrules and in fuzzy sets so that one can pursue the FRBS \nstructure optimization along with the accuracy at the same \ntime. On the rule level: 1) one of insignificant rules (rules that \ncontribute the least to any prediction error increase when not \ninclude these rules) is removed for each cloned FRBS at each \niteration step unless the rule base reaches the fewest rules \ndesignated by the user; 2) one of singleton rules [12] (rules \nwhose comprising fuzzy sets are similar to singleton set) is \nremoved for each cloned FRBS at each iteration step; 3) the \nmost similar pair of rules based on the Similarity of Rule \nPremise (SRP) [20] are merged for each cloned FRBS at each \n1\n2\n1\n2\u03c3c11\n1\n1\u03c3c\n1\n3\n1\n3\u03c3c\n1\n2\n1\n2\u03c3c11\n1\n1\u03c3c\n1\n3\n1\n3\u03c3c\n5XOH\u0015 5XOH\u00165XOH\u0014\n)5%6\u0015\n5XOH\u0018 5XOH\u00195XOH\u0017\nyycccc 22323222221212 |;; \u03c3\u03c3\u03c3\u03c3\nyycccc 33333323231313 |;; \u03c3\u03c3\u03c3\u03c3\n(b)\n(c)\n5XOH\u0015 5XOH\u00165XOH\u0014\n)5%6\u0014\n,QDFWLYH\u00035XOH ,QDFWLYH\u00035XOH,QDFWLYH\u00035XOH\n,QHIIHFWLYH\u00032SWLPL]DWLRQ\nFig. 6.

On the fuzzy sets level: 1) one fuzzy set that is \nthe most similar to the universal fuzzy set is labeled as \u2018Don\u2019t \ncare\u2019 for each clone at each iteration step; 2) two most similar \nfuzzy sets from the inputs and output dimensions are merged \nto form a single fuzzy set for each cloned FRBS at each \niteration step based on the similarity measure \u0735\u123a\u0723\u0bdc\u0bdd\u01e1 \u0723\u0bdf\u0bdd\u123b [20]. \nA set of thresholds which control the various similarity \nmeasures are specified by the users. Interested readers are \nreferred to [17] for the detailed steps and user specified \nparameters involved in the model simplification process. In the \nfollowing experiment, all the user specified parameters are \nkept the same as those in [17]. However, during the \nexperiments, we found that the thresholds are not critical \nparameters due to the following two reasons: 1) only one \nfuzzy rule or two fuzzy sets are removed or merged at each \niteration step; 2) elitism is adopted to record any non-\ndominated solution found at each iteration step.  \nIV. EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES\nTo validate the proposed modeling framework, it is applied \nto the modeling of Tensile Strength (TS) of alloy steels. 3760 \nTS data are used, in which 75% of the data are used for \ntraining and the remaining data are used for testing. Another \n12 more recent samples are used as the unseen data set to \nvalidate the generalisation properties of the model. The TS \ndata includes 15 inputs and one output. The inputs consists of \nthe weight percentages for the chemical compositions, the test \ndepth, the size of the specimen and the site where it has been \nproduced, the cooling medium, the quenching and tempering \ntemperatures. The output is the tensile strength itself. The \nnumber of rules used to extract initial FRBS using G3Kmeans \nis 12, and the initial population is set to 7. Fig. 7 shows the \nPareto front after 2000 iteration, in which a set of 47 non-\ndominated FRBS have been elicited.   \nTable 1 summarized the results obtained using IMOFM_S \nand IMOFM_M, and compared these results with those in \n[21]. Due to the constraints on space, only a few obtained \n\u2018Pareto\u2019 FRBS are presented without any loss of generality. As \nshown in Table 1, the predictive performance of the initial \nMamdani FRBS in the first modelling stage is slightly worse \nthan that of the singleton FRBS and the results presented in \n[21]. However, using the proposed BEP updating formulas, the \naccuracy of such an inaccurate Mamdani FRBS has been \nimproved greatly in the second modelling stage. More \nimportantly, a much better generalisation ability has been seen \nfor the refined Mamdani FRBS on the 12 unseen data. After \nthe third modelling stage, a set of \u2018Pareto\u2019 FRBSs are obtained \nusing the proposed IMOFM_M. As one can see, even with a 7-\nrule simplified FRBS, the predictive performances on the \ntraining and testing data sets are better than those presented in \n[21] using a 12-rule FRBS. The refined singleton FRBS \nperformed badly on the validation data when using a 12-rule \nFRBS. However, its generalisation ability is much improved \nwhen its structure redundancies have been removed. Those \nredundancies are responsible for the overfitting of the training \ndata, which may lead to a bad generalisation on unseen \nsituations. Since the singleton FRBS is a special type of TSK \nmodel, good generalisation ability using fewer rule is \nexpected, e.g. an 8-rule FRBS in IMOFM_S. With a few more \nrules, Mamdani FRBS represents a competitive generalizer, \ne.g. a 10-rule FRBS in IMOFM_S.        \nTABLE I.

As one can see from this figure, the \nevolution starts from the refined FRBS and expands the Pareto \nfront during the course of the optimization.

CONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper, a systematic multi-objective Mamdani fuzzy \nmodelling approach is proposed. By using bell-shape \nmembership functions for the consequents and merging fuzzy \nset not only in the inputs but also in the output, the resulted \nconsequents are more interpretable compared to the singleton \nones. The parameter updating formulas developed in the \nsecond modelling stage using BEP technique could be used \nseparately in order to improve the predictive performance of \nMamdani FRBS. It is also worth mentioning that the proposed \nthree-stage modelling framework is fairly general since one \ncan easily replace any one or all of the modelling stages with \ntheir own developed single objective and multi-objective \noptimization algorithms. The mentioned \u2018unordered sets of \nrules\u2019 is a common problem associated with all EA-based \nfuzzy modelling approaches. Hence, special cautions should \nbe taken when one intends to devise a variation operator based \non the interaction of individuals.  \nREFERENCES\n[1] T. Takagi, M.
