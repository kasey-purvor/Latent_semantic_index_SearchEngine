Constrained by land\nshortages, committed to the pragmatics of efficient delivery, and no doubt influenced\nby global trends in mass-housing provision, it enthusiastically adopted the modernist\nhighrise as the architectural type for its post-independence programme of universal\nhousing provision.The HDB has routinely reflected with pride on the part which it, and\nits housing programme, have played in the making of modern Singapore. For example,\nthe HDB's main office, dubbed `The Hub', has always boasted a small museum space\nshowcasing the institution's achievements. In the HDB's current headquarters, the\nmuseum is part of an extensive display space called `The Gallery' which uses a series\nof `before and after' interior recreations to tell the story of the HDB's role in\nproviding `homes for the people'.Visitors are led past `slum',`squatter', and `kampung'\ninteriors, on to the modern interiors of the 1960s highrises, and then to contemporary\ninnovations like the entirely prefabricated `plug-on' bathroom. The curatorial sensi-\nbility of this display lays somewhere between that of the museum diorama and the\nshow home and, indeed, visitors can move seamlessly from the interior recreations of\nthe museum space to a series of full-scale, fully decorated interior layouts of HDB\nflats currently on offer to prospective buyers.(1) The centrality of these displays at The\nHub hint at the special role which the interior and interior decoration have played in\nthe housing-provision story of Singapore.\nThe modern touch: interior design and modernisation\nin post-independence Singapore\nJane M Jacobs\nInstitute of Geography, School of GeoSciences, University of Edinburgh, Drummond Street,\nEdinburgh EH8 9XP, Scotland; e-mail: jane.jacobs@ed.ac.uk\nStephen Cairns\nDepartment of Architecture, School of Arts, Culture and Environment, University of Edinburgh,\n20 Chambers Street, Edinburgh EH1 1JZ, Scotland; e-mail: stephen.cairns@ed.ac.uk\nReceived 3 April 2006; in revised form 3 October 2006; published online 11 June 2007\nEnvironment and Planning A 2008, volume 40, pages 572^595\nAbstract. The authors take as their focus the advice on interior design and decoration that Singapore's\nHousing Development Board (HDB) distributed to residents as part of its programme of universal\nhousing provision. Through a series of regular articles appearing in the HDB publication Our Home\n(1972^1989), readers were presented with stories that showed how selected HDB residents decorated\ntheir newly acquired highrise flats. The authors detail the relationship between this design advice and\nthe commitment to modernist design principles, the self-conscious pragmatism of the HDB, and the\nreliance on a limited market logic (`homeownership'). The HDB's vision of the benefit of its highrise\nhousing programme was, from the outset, complexly entangled with cultivating individual investments\nin the home by way of interior design and decoration practices. The paper contributes not only to the\nspecific story of Singaporean housing, but also to wider scholarship on modernism, the everyday\npractices of interior design, and housing consumption.\nDOI:10.1068\/a39123\n(1) The visual resonance between the backward-looking museum and the forward-looking show\nhomes is a result of both having been produced by the same design consultancy.In this paper we argue that the home interior lay at the heart of a finely calibrated\nrelationship in which state-based processes of collective consumption combined with\nemergent patterns of individual consumption in the cultivation of a modern, post-\nindependence Singaporean nation and citizenry. We focus specifically on previously\nundocumented advice given on home decoration by way of a series of articles appear-\ning in the HDB-produced magazine, Our Home, which was distributed free to all HDB\ntenants between 1972 and 1989\u00f6a period covering the Third to Sixth Building\nProgrammes. These articles make it possible to see past the often uniform exteriors\nof these modernist highrises and glimpse varied outcomes of interior styling. In these\nemergent Singaporean interiors amateur interpretations of interior style mixed with\nidealised notions of modern decor, freedoms of expression jostled with state regulatory\nframeworks, and efforts to encourage domestic creativity rubbed against the economic\nbenefits and costs of expanding home-related consumption.\nWe appreciate that our focus on a subset of official housing discourse in Singapore\nruns counter to the ethnographic emphasis currently shaping, among other things,\nstudies of the home (see, as examples, Attfield, 1999; Buchli, 1999; Clarke, 2001;\nLlewellyn, 2004; Madigan and Munro, 1996; Miller, 1988; 2001a; Sparke, 2004; Tolia-\nKelly, 2004). This is not based on a judgment about the relative merits of studies of\ndiscourse versus studies of practice: rather, it is born out of both practical and\ntheoretical concerns. From a practical point of view, the textual archive is essential to\nhistorical work on the interior. Decorative schemes (along with residents) change\nfrequently such that they are relatively ephemeral artifacts. Our retrospective account-\ning of them depends, in large part, upon existing records (Sparke, 2004). For example,\naccessing what interiors might have looked like in post-independence Singapore is\ngreatly assisted by the interior decor articles which appeared in Our Home, for they\nfeature images of the now largely vanished interiors of actual HDB residents. They\nalso feature residents' explanations of their choices and constraints, offering a valuable\ninsight into everyday practices of interior decoration. Admittedly, the homes and\nresidents featured in Our Home would have conformed to official ideals for HDB\ninteriors, such that these residents and their flats could operate illustratively. But while\nthis filter creates a limit in terms of these articles offering a window onto the full range\nof homemaking practices of the time, it also brings clearly into view the recursive\nrelationship between the `ideal' (discursive) home and the `real' (practised) home\n(see Chapman and Hockey, 1999; Sparke, 2004, van Caudenberg and Heynen, 2004).\nThis leads us to the theoretical value of attending to a representational field such as\nthat contained in Our Home. Muthesius (2005) has shown that the emergence in the\n19th century of the private domestic interior as a discrete site and conceptual category\nwas, from the very outset, accompanied by a range of representational media such as\nthe interior design magazine and the shop window `stage set' display. Understanding\n``the actual design and consumption of interiors'' is always in conversation with ``the\nrepresentation of design in mass-mediated form'' (Aynsley and Berry, 2005, page 1).\nFollowing Miller (2001a), we wish to press this relational association further by showing\nhow the house itself is part of a process of mediation whereby a household encounters\nwider society, including ideas about how a home interior should look, how one can be\nmodern, or, even, how one can be Singaporean. As we show, the look of the emergent\nSingaporean interior was not about styles that belonged to some preexisting, determin-\ning sphere, like that of `modernist design'; nor simply to structures external or prior to\nthe act of homemaking (like the prescriptions of a state-based housing programme);\nnor did it reside solely in the ``expressive'' home-decorating efforts of residents, even\nwhen done as do-it-yourself (Miller, 2001a, page 10). Singaporean interiors, like home\ninteriors generally, emerged out of a complex and often contradictory relationship\nInterior design and modernisation in post-independence Singapore 573between decorative and consumption practices and ideals, orders, and grammars that\nresided both in the site of the home and elsewhere\u00f6on design drawing boards, in\nbureaucracies, in magazines, in commercial premises, in a resident's imaginative and\npractical world, in the very colour of paint, texture of walls, and pieces of furniture\n(be they newly acquired or handed down) (Sorensen, 2002, page 24). For example, in\nrelation to ``the proliferation of home decoration and the popularization of design''\nin Britain, Clarke (2001, page 26) acknowledges that the house form and normative\nideas of style ``cast a shadow'' over individual interior decoration decisions and efforts.\nBut, as an alternate to this ``shadow'', she does not simply propose that analysis turn to\nan expressive counterstyling held surely and solely in the hands of the resident. Rather,\nClarke (page 42) reveals how the relationship between ``ideal'' and ``actual'' worlds of\nhome decorating is embedded in a complex process of mediation whereby a resident's\n``internalization'' of ``ideal home'' design prescriptions entangle with his or her own\n``projection'' of ``ideal home'' design fantasies and aspirations.\nWhere is the modern interior?\nThe special role played by the HDB's notions of domestic interior in the modernisation\nof post-independence Singapore echoes the central place the interior held in early\ntheorisations of modernity more generally. For example, Benjamin (1999) saw the\nornamented 19th-century domestic interior as an emblematic space of modernity,\nagainst which the ideals and aesthetics of modernism formed. In what follows we\ntake as a starting point Benjamin's reflections on the relationship between the domestic\ninterior, modernity, and modernism. In doing so we do not wish to imply that a\nmodernity (including architectural modernism) that originated in Europe was simply\napplied to, or poorly imitated in, Singapore. To do so would be to entrap Singaporean\nmodernisation and modernism within a developmentalist model (Robinson, 2006). But\nwe do not wish to dislodge modernism entirely from the specificities of its production\nsuch that its `international' aspirations outrank the situated nature of its making (and\nremaking). The stylistic and ideological shape of the modernism in which Singapore\ninvested in so enthusiastically through its housing programme was, in the first instance,\ngenerated in Europe (although see Vogt, 1998). The post-independence Singaporean inte-\nrior, although made and lived within the context of quite localised agendas and aspirations\nand, as we shall see, reshaping modernism quite dramatically, was at the same time\ninevitably in conversation with this other history and geography.\nThe 19th-century domestic interior was inextricably linked to the expansion and\nintensification of urban experience under industrialisation. The industrial city not only\ndelivered new freedoms but also previously unknown levels of fragmentation and\nstimulation (Simmel, 1950). In this context, ``living space became distinguished from\nthe space of work'' as never before, offering a refuge from the busy-ness outside\n(Benjamin, 1973, page 167). With this, the consumption of domestic goods offered\nnew opportunities for individual expression and identification (Benjamin, 1999,\npage 227). The home and the commodities within it became part of a contradictory\narrangement of defensive display. On the one hand, furnishings, finishings, and orna-\nments were increasingly asked to carry meaning as objects of self-expression. On the\nother, interior styling was such that domestic objects were secreted away through the use of\n``[c]overlets and antimacassars, cases and containers'' ``e \u00a8 tuis, dust covers and sheaths''\n(Benjamin, 1999, pages 9 and 226). This ``fortified'' interior depended upon a nested\nspatiality wherein one space\u00f6be it a room, a cabinet, a receptacle, a pouch, or\npocket\u00f6always seemed to contain another, in a refining and miniaturising sequence.\nBourgeois homemakers fabricated scenes, moods, and atmospheres of the ``far away\nand the long ago'' such that the living room itself was ``a box in the theater of the world''\n574 J M Jacobs, S Cairns(pages 8^9). Here the ``self-satisfied burgher'' could create interior atmospheres and\nthrough them ``know something of the feeling that the next room might have witnessed\nthe coronation of Charlemagne ... the assassination of Henri VI, the signing of theTreaty\nof Verdun ... the wedding of Otto and Theophano'' (page 216).\nIn this domestic scene the bourgeois urban subject and the consumer object were\nentangled in an evermore intricate coproduction of selfhood. That intimacy left its\ntrace in the very fabric of the home, often enough velour or plush fabrics, which readily\n``preserve[d] the imprint of all contact'' (Benjamin, 1999, page 9). Such surfaces acted\nas clues to, and cues for, the pattern of daily life. In Benjamin's view, the 19th-century\ndwelling operated like a shell or a compass case in which shelter and the occupant were\nso ``moulded'' to one another that they were mutually defining (page 220). Benjamin\nwas critical of this fit, which he thought produced a ``nihilistic cosiness'', a dream-like\n``satanic calm'' from which one might never stir (page 216, see also van Herck, 2005).\nAlthough these interior worlds operated quite literally as escapes and retreats from the\ncapitalist competition animating the industrial city, their production depended upon\nnew practices of consumption. As Holland (1988, page 412) suggests, the home became\nthe ``altar'' of a new private religion of industrial capitalism, ``and its idol ... [was] the\nfetish called `Commodity'.''\nBenjamin's critique of this commodified and phantasmagorical mode of dwelling,\ndrew upon modernist models of living, as articulated in Le Corbusier's Urbanisme\n(1924) (translated as The City of Tomorrow and Its Planning). The transparency, air-\niness, and openness of Le Corbusier's vision ``put an end to dwelling in the old sense''\n(Benjamin, 1999, page 221). Modern architecture had little interest in sustaining the\ninterior as a personal retreat serving individual expression.The smoothness of materials\nused in modern architecture and the flatness of its forms were inimical to the traces of\nits inhabitants and sought to hide nothing. ``Glass'', as Benjamin notes, ``is such a hard\nand flat material that nothing settles on it .... It is above all the enemy of secrets. It is the\nenemy of possessions'' (cited by Reed, 1996, page 10). Ornament too was a specific\nbother for the modern style. Essays like ``Ornament and crime'' (Loos, 1997[1908]) laid\nthe grounds for subsequent modernist thinkers to designate ornament as undesirable,\nnot only on the basis of aesthetics, but also because it was associated with undesirable\n`primitive', or `feudal', social orders. As Lubbock (1995, page 301) has noted, the advo-\ncates of the modern style ``claimed that good modern design and civilisation were one\nand the same.''\nThis apparent indifference to the traces of domestic life is perhaps most compel-\nlingly represented by the dogma of whiteness, now a ``given'' of modernism's aesthetic\n(Young, 2004, page 13). Architectural historian Mark Wigley (1995) has shown that by\nthe late 1920s the identity of modern architecture came to be ``located in its white\nsurfaces'', so much so that the idea that modern architecture is white was accepted\ninternationally (page xiv). For Le Corbusier, and other modernists, white was not\nsimply a colour scheme: it was an embodiment of the ethical, political, and moral\nsubstance of modernism. This is most clearly stated in Le Corbusier's 1925 book L'art\nde \u00a8 coratif d'aujourd'hui (translated as The Decorative Art of Today 1987), in which he\nexamined the objects of contemporary everyday life and condemned those that had\nornate decoration. He read such decoration as a mask that alienates the object from its\nuser, creating a nostalgia that disguises its true origin and function. In his repudiation\nof the visual confusion and alienation which he believed ornamental surfaces\npromoted, Le Corbusier advocated the whitewashing of architecture\u00f6both inside\nand out. For Le Corbusier (1987 [1925], page 190) the white surface functioned like\n``an x-ray of beauty'' and ``eye of truth'' disclosing new aesthetic potentials of\nunadorned, mass-produced, functional objects of modern metropolitan life.\nInterior design and modernisation in post-independence Singapore 575Modernism's journey from the drawing boards and manuscripts of designers to the\ninteriors of 20th-century homemakers was by way of a range of representational media,\nthemselves elaborations of the media that accompanied the emergent 19th-century\ndomestic interior. The reproduction `ideal home' or `show home' was significant in\nthis regard, playing an important part in the dissemination of the ideal of the design\nand living principles of modernism [Chapman (1999), Chapman and Hockey (1999);\nClarke (2001); Woodham (2004), and specifically in relation to Singapore, Baydar\nNalbantoglu (1997)]. Much recent research has shown that the coherent modernist\nvisions of drawing boards, magazines, and show homes did not comprehensively replace\nearlier configurations of domestic space or preexisting home-styling habits. Such\nmodernist visions always jostled with existing practices and preferences, coming to\nbe reshaped by distinctive national contexts, specific state and private sector agencies,\nexisting housing fabrics, as well as residents' inherited objects, persistent nostalgias,\nand existing grammars for domestic living (cf Attfield,1989; 1999; Boudon,1979; Buchli,\n1999; Chua, 1997; Gullestad, 1992; Llewellyn, 2004; Miller, 1988; 2001b). It is not our\nintention to recount in detail the growing research that has accounted for how mod-\nernist domestic architectures have been lived. However, we would like to note some\ndistinctive analytical threads in relation to the work on lived modernism. First, there is\na tendency always to position modernism, at least in the first instance, as belonging to\nvisions and structures external to those of the householders themselves. For example,\nin the work of Gullestad (1992, page 77) ideas of modernism belong in the hands of\nplanning and architectural professionals who are responsible for what she refers to\nas ``the almost mute'' outsides of houses. Domestic modernism is further caricatured\nas inserting itself into the daily lives of householders either by stealth, through the\nconstraints imposed by modernist built fabric, or by force, in the case of state-provided\nmodernism. For example, Buchli's (1999) study of architectural modernism in the\nSoviet Union shows how the ``domestic front'' became a ``locus of battle'' against petit\nbourgeois values, such that homemaking and taste became legitimate concerns for\nthe state (page 41), justifying interventions in everything from levels of light to the\nnecessity for ``de-artifactualisation'' (pages 140^149). Such interpretations tend to\nexternalise the origins of the idealised domestic modern such that the reality of a lived\nmodern must always be a matter of internal (resident) reaction: `accommodation',\n`interpretation', `adaptation', `adjustment', `appropriation', `resistance'. As stated in our\nopening sections, we would wish to assume a more complicated relationality between\nthe agents that make the modern interior, such that the home is more properly under-\nstood as ``both the source and the setting of mobility and change'' (Miller, 2001a,\npage 4)\u00f6a multimedia event that entangles design ideals, the materiality of things,\nrules and regulations, with individual and collective effort.\nTurning houses into homes in post-independence Singapore\nMuch has been written about the unique public housing provision programme of post-\nindependence Singapore, and in what follows we confine our attention to those aspects\nof the existing scholarship that bear upon the place of the interior and the role of\ninterior styling. The structure and style of housing provision in Singapore animated\nthe interior of flats in a very specific way, such that homemaking became not simply\nsomething that residents did within the freedom of their own home but a matter of state\nconcern and effort. The HDB began its task of `housing a nation' as a fledgling post-\nindependence bureaucracy, having assumed the responsibility of housing provision from\nthe colonial Singapore Improvement Trust. The post-independence Singaporean state\ninvested heavily in highrise modernist housing, but did so for reasons that went far beyond\na social welfare commitment to provide ``decent shelter'' (Castells et al, 1990, page 303).\n576 J M Jacobs, S CairnsHousing provision was a key mechanism in the making of modern Singapore\u00f6politically,\nculturally, and economically. Chua (1997) has observed that the commitment to uni-\nversal provision meant that housing came to operate as a covenant between people and\ngovernment, with continually upgraded housing offered in exchange for political sup-\nport for the People's Action Party (PAP) (see also Lim, 1989). Housing also provided a\ntool for the cultural integration of the nation. By applying specific formulas of multi-\nethnic mixing in blocks and estates, the HDB provided a crucial mechanism for\nengineering a well-integrated, multiethnic Singapore (Lai, 1995). Housing became an\nintrinsic part of this emergent `developmental state': lowering costs of living, developing\nurban infrastructure, directing capital formation (through compulsory savings), and\nproviding employment opportunities (Castells et al, 1990).\nThe prioritising of development was a hallmark of post-independence Singapore\nand, as Kong (2000, page 411) notes, this was motorised by a pragmatic reasoning\njustified by the uncertainty surrounding post-independence Singapore's chances of\nsurvival as a viable social, economic, and political entity (see also Castells et al, 1990,\npage 190). During, this period the state cultivated a continual sense of crisis and\nurgency in relation to which it could exercise exceptional powers. One such intervention\nwas the decommodification of land, which allowed its compulsory acquisition for\nthe purpose of any development deemed to be in the national interest (Perry et al,\n1997, page 6, see also Chua, 1997). Clancey (2004), for example, has noted that\nSingapore's post-independence housing programme was justified explicitly by the diag-\nnosis of a `housing emergency'. Landmark events, such as the 1961 fire in the `squatter\nvillage' of Bukit Ho Swee which left hundreds homeless, were used by the state\nto underline both the `necessity' of housing modernisation, as well as the ability to\ntackle the problem quickly and efficiently (Clancey, 2004, page 45; see also Chua,1989).\nSingapore's `housing emergency' was at the same time linked to official adjudications\nthat existing housing (be it kampung, shop-house, or squatter settlement) was inappro-\npriate because it was not modern, falling short of standards of sanitation, exhibiting\novercrowding, forcing `inappropriate'activities onto the street, or harbouring politically\nsubversive or illegal activities (see Kong and Yeoh, 1994). As such, rehousing was\nfundamentally conceived of by the state as a developmental journey: from `back then'\nto `right now', from `uncivilised' to `civilised', from `premodern' to `modern'.\nThe HDB's wholehearted embracing of highrise modernism as the architectural\nstyle for its housing programme was also justified pragmatically, rather than aesthet-\nically or ideologically (Kwek, 2004). As Lui Thai Ker (then Executive Officer) reflected\nin a 25th anniversary publication, the commitment to the highrise was ``not intended to\nshow off economic and technological capabilities''\u00f6there was ``simply no other choice''\n(Lui, 1985, page 8). Despite the HDB already being aware of what they termed their\n``inherent disadvantages''and ``handicaps'' (Tan et al, 1985, page 56), and admitting the\n``belief'' held by ``some sociologists'' that highrises contribute to a ``sense of isolation'',\npractical reasoning nonetheless led inexorably upward:\n``The HDB has taken from the start a realistic and pragmatic stand by deciding that,\nin order to house every citizen decently, the residential density must be high. In\norder to sustain a high standard of living conditions, the dwelling units must be as\nlarge as the applicants can afford. To meet the criteria of high-density and large\nflats, the buildings have to be high-rise'' (Lui, 1985, page 8).\nIn Housing a Nation (Lui, 1985) the official narrative makes clear the fine-grained effort\nthe HDB put into overcoming problems that were already evident in the highrises of\nEurope and North America. This effort was manifest in rules and regulations about\nhow residents should live in their homes and communities, systems of housing alloca-\ntion, as well as a range of educational programmes that cultivated specific types\nInterior design and modernisation in post-independence Singapore 577of behaviour and values. It is perhaps unsurprising that scholarly and populist\ncommentators routinely describe Singapore as `authoritarian' in style. Certainly,\nCastells et al (1990, page 8) see the collective consumption of housing as a key\nmechanism of ``social control in the management of the economy and of the society''.\nBut perhaps it is Wee's (2001, page 987) characterisation of Singapore's mode of rule as\n``disciplinary modernisation'' that best approximates what was operating during the\nimmediate post-independence years. For, as Wee observes, during this time the state\nsought not to be unilaterally authoritarian, but to ``re-tool the subjectivities of its\ncitizenry in the name of a modernist ... utopianism'' (pages 987 and 999).\nThe practical complexity of Singapore's development style is explicitly expressed\nthrough one unique feature of Singapore's `public' housing story, this being the Home\nOwnership for the People Scheme, established in 1964. The scheme augmented the\ncommitment to universal housing provision with a vision for a ``property-owning\ndemocracy'' and did so by allowing all HDB residents the opportunity to ``buy'' (on\nlong-term 99 year, leaseholds) their flats (HDB Annual Report 1964). As Chua (1997,\npage 3) notes, in most advanced capitalist contexts where housing provision is domi-\nnated by a private property system, public housing operates as a ``contingent response\nto market failures in providing affordable housing for all.'' As such, it is structurally\nresidualised and marginalised within that wider market hegemony. The Singaporean\nsystem of housing provision deviates from this structure in significant ways, such that\npublic provision proceeded in unison with what Chua (1997, page 3) called the ``dis-\nciplinary constraints of the market''. The Singaporean homeownership scheme was\nheavily subsidised by the state, both directly and indirectly. The decommodification\nof land for the purpose of compulsory acquisition kept land values out of the equation\ndetermining house prices until 1987. Indeed, as it enjoyed a virtual monopoly on supply\nof housing in Singapore, the HDB was also able to fix tenure eligibility and prices of\nflats according to factors of its own determining (mainly the state of the economy, and\nlevels of affordability). Initial take-up of the scheme was low, so in 1968 a new initiative\nwas introduced which allowed residents to use a proportion of their compulsorily\nacquired savings, held in the government's Central Provident Fund (CPF) (see Lin\nand Tyabji, 1991; Tan, 1998). HDB tenants and others wishing to enter HDB housing,\ncould not only pay their monthly mortgage through their CPF, but also call upon it for\nthe initial 20% downpayment. In the year following the opening of the CPF monies to\naspirant homeowners, applications to buy HDB flats tripled from 2384 to 7407, while\napplicants to rent almost halved (Castells et al, 1990, page 233). By 1970 some 63% of\nall public housing applicants applied to buy (Chua, 1997, page 23) and by 1979 61%\nof the 337247 units of the HDB were owner-occupied (Castells et al, 1990, page 236).\nThis system of ``public home ownership'' (Tu, 1999, page 100) is especially relevant\nto understanding the post-independence Singapore interior, and the role of design in its\nmaking. Although there were economic and political aspirations associated with\nencouraging homeownership, this strategy also protected and enhanced existing state\ninvestment in housing. It was assumed that homeownership would encourage residents\nto look after their homes:``they have an investment in it and they look after it'', said the\nSenior Principal Architect of the HDB in the Straits Times in 1984 (quoted by Castells\net al, 1990, page 231). Furthermore, from 1971 onwards, limited opportunities were\nopened up for owners to sell on their homes to others eligible for public housing, at\na price agreed upon between seller and buyer. Capital gains acquired through the sale\ncould be used to buy into a better flat or, if the vendor elected to downgrade, be\nrealised as profit. Although sales of this sort could only be made once (thus preventing\nthe public stock being used for speculation), it did convert the HDB flat into an\n``investment good'' from the point of view of residents (Chua, 1997, page 24).\n578 J M Jacobs, S CairnsWith the introduction of the homeownership scheme new expectations emerged\naround the type and standard of flats provided, and one of the HDB's most demanding\nadministrative preoccupations became maintenance of the asset value of public housing\nflats (Chua, 2003, page 770). In this context there was a need to produce flats with a`value\npotential' in excess of that attached to the idea of `emergency shelter'.The supply emphasis\nmoved away from one-room emergency flats, to larger and more varied layouts. In 1966\nthe Design and Research Unit was established by the HDB specifically to study and advise\non ways to improve the standard of flats, not only to meet residents' housing needs better,\nbut also to ensure their marketability. During the 1970s a number of improved flat designs\nwere developed, including the five-room `standard'; `new' flats with larger rooms and\nimproved ventilation and fixtures; and the spacious `Model A' flats with 10%^20%\nmore floor area (Castells et al, 1990, page 237). By 1979 the HDB was in the process of\nconverting all one-room `emergency' flats\u00f6knocking together units to create three-room\nflats\u00f6and had introduced the first generation of `executive' flats.\nEntering the Singapore interior\nIn this model of housing provision the responsibility for the finishes and look of\ninteriors had a specific structure. Apart from selected blocks, all HDB flats were built\nwith the expectation that residents would finish and furnish the interior of the flat\nthemselves. From the 1970s, when the homeownership scheme was introduced, the\nlarge majority of flats had only basic fixtures and finishes provided by the HDB in\norder to ensure minimal standards of comfort and sanitation (sinks and toilet) and to\nprotect the main structure from water damage (tiling in the wet areas). Indeed, as\nhomeownership took off there was increasing dissatisfaction with the basic HDB\nfinishes. Residents routinely worked over existing finishes and fixtures or removed\nthem. To avoid ``wasting'' labour and materials, the HDB switched to offering flats\nthat were simply ``a bare carcass''\u00f6a ``shell with cement rendered walls and hollow\nblock walls without plastering'' (Wong and Yeh, 1985, page 68). As the official HDB\nhistory Housing a Nation reported, ``residents ... renovate their flats according to their\nown tastes and budgets. It helps to keep construction costs low, reduce wastage and\nminimise the inherent monotony of the standardised floor plans through the resident's\npersonal touch'' (Wong and Yeh,1985, page 68). From the outset, then, the state harnessed\nindividual consumption efforts to the collective consumption of housing such that home\nimprovements worked to subsidise state housing provision (see Baudrillard 2005 [1996],\npage 24). Under such conditions it is hardly surprising, and was in fact inevitable, that\nthe interior spaces of highrises came to be partof the educative and regulatory efforts of the\nstate. To date, the considerable scholarship on housing provision in Singapore has given\nlimited attention to the ways in which the interiors of homes were shaped.The two notable\nexceptions, that of Chua (1997) and Castells et al (1990), we have already drawn upon\nextensively. Theirs is important scholarship\u00f6not only for what it tells us about the\nSingaporean housing process in general, but also the Singapore interior specifically.\nEach accounts for those interiors by way of quite distinct explanatory frames which, it\nis useful to dwell upon in relation to our own approach.\nChua's (1997; 1999) sustained interest in the sociology and politics of housing\nprovision in Singapore has included some of the most detailed political and ethno-\ngraphic accounts. Amongst other things, his work includes rare attention to the detail\nof how residents lived in their newly acquired highrise flats. For example, Chua observed\nhow individual households were forced to restructure their ``symbolic universe'' and\n``cultural practices'' upon making the move from more traditional dwelling types to the\nstandardised units of the modernist HDB flats. Such ``adjustment'', he argued, was\n``often hindered by restrictive regulations'' imposed by the HDB as well as by the\nInterior design and modernisation in post-independence Singapore 579``values'' that were ``inscribed'' into the design of the standard dwellings themselves\n(Chua, 1997, pages 6^7). Chua proceeds to give an account of this problem:\n``For example, architectural modernism demands that the fac \u00b0 ade of a block be\nmaintained in uniform colour for visual consistency, reducing residents' freedom\nto choose the colours of their dwellings. Structural elements that fix the layout of\nthe housing unit itself cannot be tampered with, radically reducing the residents'\nability to redeploy the interior spaces provided for them. The restrictions make it\ndifficult for affected households to break away from the monotony of the standard-\nised housing units and transform them into individual `homes'. As the home is tied\nto the identity of a household, freedom to individualise will undoubtedly affect the\nsatisfactory adjustments of the occupants'' (page 7).\nDespite these limits, Chua (1997, pages 90^112) documented in detail one partic-\nular type of intervention made by tenants to the standardised flats, this being the\ncultural adjustments made by ethnically identified occupants (Chinese, Hindu, Malay).\nFor example, he documented the ways in which Chinese residents changed room layouts\nto create symmetry and accommodate altars; Malays transformed storerooms into\nprayer rooms; and Hindis partitioned space to ensure religious protocols relating to\nhygiene. Although opting for the softer notion of ``adjustment'', Chua's analysis of what\nresidents did to their modernist flats has much in common with the everyday resident\n`appropriations' that others have charted in relation to the lived fortunes of European\nmodernism. That said, Chua's observations imply that it was a traditionalised and\nethnically identified culture that was the motivating force for residents, interventions\nin the modernist interiors of Singapore. In Chua's reading of the Singaporean interior,\ntradition and modernity are set in sharp relief. On the one hand, the imposing modern\nlogics of the highrise produced constraints upon how residents could live. On the other,\nwe are shown how a traditionally determined framework of resources was drawn upon\nby residents in making limited `adjustments' to their new homes.\nThe analysis of Castells et al (1990), in contrast, is suggestive of a wider set of\nimaginative and material resources at work in the shaping of post-independence\nSingaporean interiors. Turning specifically to the impact of homeownership, they\nnote that owners would spend often quite substantial additional amounts of money\nto ``rectify and recondition'' their flats, ``finishing their flats with marble, ceramic, or\nother tiles, replastering the walls, replacing the doors, upgrading the sanitary fixtures\nand electrical wiring ... and furnishing their flats'' (page 265). Such investment was\nfacilitated in part by credit arrangements available for such purposes, and from early\non the pages of Our Home featured advertisements by Credit POSB, a state-supported\nfinancial service that offered loans of up to 90% of the cost of renovation or furnishing\nprojects. Castells et al (1990), drawing on newspaper reports of the time, explain this\nenthusiastic investment in decoration by reference to the poor quality of the finishes\nand basic fittings of HDB flats in the 1970s. As they note,``many spent more than what\nthe flats cost to create not just a comfortable home but a luxurious flat'' (page 265).\nIndeed, so extensive was the investment of residents in the interiors of their flats there\nwas concern that the cost of public housing was indirectly being inflated by 10% to\n30%. Furthermore, in the mid-1980s, when a task force was established to inquire into\nthe causes of the economic recession of 1985^86, it was the collective and individual\noverinvestment in the housing sector that came under specific scrutiny. According\nto that task force, by the mid-1980s it was conservatively estimated that an average\nof 37% of Singaporean's income was spent on buying a home, housing-related services\n(such as insurance, maintenance, tax, utilities), and renovation. Not only was this\nspending deemed excessive, but so too was the aesthetic effect. As Castells et al\n(1990, page 323) note, because homebuyers did not need to draw from their own savings\n580 J M Jacobs, S Cairnsto purchase a flat (drawing instead on CPF savings), they ``lavishly spent their savings\nor even obtained loans to renovate and furnish their flats in an ostentatious manner.''\nSo worrying was this excessive expenditure on home improvements that the task force\nwarned that the ability of the CFP to fund old-age pensions might be impaired, sending\nthe nation into financial crisis.\nIn the final part of this paper we chart a supplementary analytical pathway to those\nfollowed by these existing stories of the making of the Singapore interior. In doing so\nwe draw upon Rose's more general analysis of `interior' realms in modernity. Extend-\ning the work of Foucault, Rose has shown how the ``private self'', as he calls it, is\nsubject to governing by way of a range of medical, sociological, and psychological\ntechnologies (Miller and Rose, 1997; Rose, 1989; 1998; Osborne and Rose, 1999). Rose's\nwork is specifically relevant to advanced liberal democracies, in which consumption\nplays a central role in the making of subjectivity. In such contexts, he argues, power\ndoes not simply operate to ``dominate, deny and repress'', but works through the\nprocesses that form and enact subjectivity (1998, page 151). He argues that we can no\nlonger think of clear divisions between ``the state'' and ``private life'', suggesting that\nanalysing ``the relations between `the self'and power ... is not a matter of lamenting the\nways in which our autonomy is suppressed by the state, but of investigating the ways\nin which subjectivity has become an essential ... resource for certain strategies ... of\nregulation'' (page 152). In this sense, he exposes how in advanced liberal democracies\nthere is a structure of ``governing through the freedom and aspirations of subjects rather\nthan in spite of them'' (page 155, original emphasis). As noted, Rose specifically\ncontemplates these arguments in relation to consumption. Consumers, he argues, are\nconstituted as ``actors'' pursuing a certain ``quality of life'' or ``life-style'' by way of\n``choice in a world of goods'' (page 162). The commodity ``cast back upon those who\npurchased it'' a certain ``glow'' that says something of who they are or want to be.\n``[D]esign, marketing and image construction'' play a vital role in this exchange between\ngoods and subjectivity and, most significantly, work to ensure that we are ``governed\nthrough the choices that we ourselves will make, under the guidance of cultural and\ncognitive authorities, in the space of regulated freedom'' (page 166). In scholarship\nwhich directly extends this thinking to the sphere of public housing consumption, Flint\n(2003) has argued that contemporary social housing clients in the UK are actively being\ncultivated as consumers of housing. Flint shows how ``values, beliefs and sentiments''\n(what Rose would term ``aesthetic elements'') prescribe a specific ``art''or ``grammar''of\nliving (Flint, 2003, page 613; see also Rose, 1989; 1998). This in turn provides the basis\nfor ``arm's length'' management of social housing populations, such that housing con-\nsumption becomes a site for the exercise of ``ethopower''\u00f6a mechanism for ``shaping\nconduct'' more broadly. It is to the shaping of this grammar for living that we now turn.\nInterior creativity\nFrom 1972 through to the late 1989 the HDB published Our Home as a bimonthly\nmagazine that was delivered free to every HDB household in Singapore and was avail-\nable for purchase at a minimal cost by non-HDB readers (figure 1).(2) The inaugural\nissue of Our Home magazine begins with a clear statement of purpose:\n```Our Home' is about you and others in HDB housing estates. You will get to know\nhow much other people are like you, how other residents live, their problems\nand how to overcome them and about their achievements ... what matters is that\nwe all make that community something to be proud of, a healthy environment\nfor our children .... `Our Home' can help us all build a better home!'' (Editorial\nOur Home June 1970, page 2).\n(2) Circulation began at 161000 (1973) and grew to 440000 (1989).\nInterior design and modernisation in post-independence Singapore 581Despite impressive circulation numbers, there is no known study of the readership\npatterns for this magazine. Anecdotal evidence suggests it is likely that, as time\nwent by, residents thought it increasingly superfluous to the way they lived in their\nincreasingly familiar HDB-provided homes. Be that as it may, the magazine\u00f6and,\nspecifically, the articles on interior design we deal with here\u00f6offer a unique window\nonto the fine-grained detail of living in HDB housing, and, specifically, the complex\ndialogue between HDB aspirations and those of the emerging homeowning democracy\nwhich its housing programme aimed to produce.\nAmong other things, the magazine offered practical advice on how to live ``properly''\nin the new highrise environment, through articles with titles like ``Making it a home sweet\nhome'' (Our Home1985, page 40),``Be a good neighbour'' (1988, page 11),``More than just a\nroof'' (1976a, page 9).The magazine brought to its readership popular accounts of the new\nkinds of living problems posed by the high-density, highrise life\u00f6ranging from\nthe dangers of littering from a height (``killer litter''), the misuse of shared balcony\nspace, urinating in lifts, to the inappropriate time to hang wet clothes or dripping mops\nfrom one's window drying poles. In relation to these problems they suggested more\nFigure 1. Front cover of first edition of Our Home (1972). \u00df Housing and Development Board,\nSingapore.\n582 J M Jacobs, S Cairns``neighbourly'' codes of practice, as well as reminding readers of actions and uses that\nwere specifically against the rules. This instructive discourse reminds us that the\nrehoused Singaporean was seen by the state as a novice with respect to modern\nhousing and living, such that their mode of inhabitation required direct shaping and\nregulating so that they could maximise the benefit of highrise rehousing. In this sense\nthe HDB was actively constructing and promulgating what Rose (1998, page 38) has\nusefully called ``repertoires of conduct'' for highrise living. This educative discourse\nwas underscored by a range of explicit regulations that specified punishable offences,\nas well as surveillance technologies that ensured compliance.\nAs noted, part of the HDB's attention in Our Home was dedicated to the way the\ninterior of flats might look. Advice on this appeared routinely in a series of regular\narticles (often under the thematic heading ``De\u00a8 cor'') from 1972 to 1982 inclusive and\nfrom then on as occasional features. In this subgenre of article the relationship between\nthe making of a modern Singaporean and the cultivation of taste through home-based\nconsumption practices is clearly evident. In Our Home the matter of making the\ninterior of the flat was variously described as ``interior de \u00a8 cor'', ``decoration'', ``design'',\n``home improvement'', or simply ``renovation''. The message about what to do with the\ninterior of one's flat was never communicated in the abstract, or by way of non-HDB\nhomes. All articles featured the efforts of existing HDB residents who had done their\ninteriors themselves, offering photographs of their interiors, and lengthy quotes of\nthese resident's design strategies. The articles are committed to a do-it-yourself (DIY)\nmodel of home decoration, although there is a self-conscious conversation with the\nprofessionalised field of interior design. For example, one of the earliest of these articles\ninvited readers of Our Home (1973a, pages 20^21) to look inside the interior of a\n``decorator's flat'' in order to see exactly what might happen to an HDB flat with an\nunlimited budget at the hands of a professional.That Mr Cheung was an interior designer\n``explains why his home is so beautifully decorated'', helped, as he was, by his wife, Sum, a\n``keen amateur''.The featuring of a professional was rare, for the main star of these articles\nwas ``The do-it-yourself decorators'' (1973b, page 21). This said, the vacillation between\namateur and professional interior design values appeared regularly in this subgenre of\narticle. Take, as an example, the article on a flat in Dover Road that began:\n``The owners of this three-bedroom flat ... profess they know very little about interior\ndesign. And yet [they] have shown that this so-called handicap has in no way\nprevented them from turning their ordinary flat into a modern and delightful\nhome'' (1981a, page 20).\nIn the next issue the featured flat was owned by another amateur who nonetheless\nmanaged to achieve a ``professional touch'':\n``If appearances are anything to go by, one look at Mr Wong's flat will lead you into\nthinking that you've stepped into an interior decorator's private apartment .... His\nartistry and flair in doing up his home ... has made it comparable to a professional\ndecorator's'' (1981b, page 18).\nThe article concluded that, despite ``ambience'', ``texture'', and ``character'' being qual-\nities given just the right attention by Mr Wong, to him these were ``just vague terms''\n(page 19). Here, the intermingling of the ideal and real that constitute the modern interior\nis well illustrated in that individual home-improvement efforts were overwritten with the\ndiscourses and visual language of a professionalised field known as `interior design'.\nNotably, the Our Home homemakers were also often depicted as men, a feature that\nwarrants attention beyond the scope of this paper. These `designer' homemakers were\ncalled upon to act as models of how other Singaporean homeowners might conduct\nthemselves in relation to their interiors. Thus the HDB resident was equipped not only\nwith ideas of what they too might do in their flat, but also confirmation that one does not\nInterior design and modernisation in post-independence Singapore 583need to be a professional to create an `interior design effect'. In this sense, we can see\nhow the HDB sought to cultivate in the modern Singaporean homeowner the\nfigure of the `interior designer'\u00f6a resident who is able to be an engineer of atmos-\nphere (Baudrillard, 2005 [1996], page 25; see also Pennartz, 1999). This framework for\ndelivering design principles placed everyday interpretations and innovations centre\nstage of the HDB's interior design story, such that modernist design principles were\ndrawn into more ordinary interiors shaped not only by design ideals, but also by the\npragmatic limits set by residents' budgets, DIY abilities, and existing furniture.\nColour\nUse of colour was an important part of the advice given to residents through the de \u00a8 cor\narticles in Our Home. Considering the indebtedness of the Singaporean highrise to\nmodernist design principles, it is unsurprising that much advice was about ``the\ndangers of heavy colour'' and the practical ``sense'' of using lighter colours, especially\nwhite (1978, pages 21 and 24). As we noted above, within modernism whiteness\noperated to reveal the true function of architectural form, delivering a transparency\nand clarity of purpose that was without disguise. This vision of architectural clarity was\nentangled with wider notions of modernisation, itself expressed through codependent\nnotions of civilisation and cleanliness. For Le Corbusier (1987 [1925], page 188) it is\nthrough whiteness that ``home is made clean. There are no more dirty, dark corners.\nEverything is shown as it is'' (original emphasis). The link between colonial structures of\ngovernance (seeing, monitoring, and controlling colonial subjects) and ideas of cleanli-\nness is now well documented (see as examples Manderson,1996; Prasha, 2001; Swanson\n1977; Thomas, 1990). In the Singapore colonial context, Yeoh (1996, page 215) docu-\nmented how sanitation ``produced a public landscape which was orderly, disciplined,\neasily policed and amenable to the demands of urban development.'' In short, a\n``sanitized city'' was at the same time understood to be a ``progressive, civilized city''.\nIn the context of post-independence Singapore, the emphasis on a clean, orderly city\nand citizenry remained, but was deployed by a newly empowered local authority in\npursuit of its own modernisation agenda. Indeed, the modernist housing programme,\nwith its emphasis on transparency and cleanliness, carried much of the practical and\nsymbolic weight of materialising a progressing and civilising Singapore.\nArticles from the first decade of Our Home (the 1970s), in particular, offered advice\nthat was consistent with modernist principles of interior design and its commitment to\nwhite and light interiors. White was routinely advocated, as in this observation:\n``there is a sense of spaciousness in the flat\u00f6contributed in no small way by the\nwhite walls'' (1976b, page 26).\nOr this:\n``Walls were all white thus opening out the area. Dark colours would have made\nthe flat look small'' (1977b, page 22).\nOr this:\n``On entering the ... flat ... one is impressed by the spaciousness and simplicity of\nde \u00a8 cor. The living and dining rooms have all-white marble floors and ... [w]alls are\nwhite ... [and] white is the dominant colour in the kitchen'' (1977a, no page).\nYet there was also ambivalence about going too far with white. For example, one all\nwhite flat was found to be ``dazzling'' but also a little ``clinical'' and in need of ``soften-\ning'' (1975, page 8). Indeed, it was more a palette of colours generally described as\n``neutral''\u00f6beiges and off-whites\u00f6that gained the approval of the HDB. Not only did\nsuch colours help make flats look ``airy'', they did not compromise a``homely''atmosphere.\nTo this approved backdrop residents were encouraged to judiciously add other colours in\nthe form of ``highlight'',``contrast'', or ``feature''elements. Mr Lee, for example, was praised\n584 J M Jacobs, S Cairnsfor his``controlled and cleverly chosen'' use of ``peacock blue'',``flaming red'', and``sunshine\nyellow'' in artwork and his creation of ``effective spots of colour'' through cushions (1975,\npage 8). Another ``modest make-over'' was praised for the ``nice touches''delivered by way\nof ``paintings'' (calendar prints of local artists' work) and ``colourful patchwork cushions''\n(1976b, page 26).Yet another DIY improvement was praised for its effective and econom-\nical use of ``decorative accents'' such as a hand-painted feature brick wall. By the 1980s the\ncommitment to white and light walls was waning and alternative looks (even including\nheavily ornamented wallpaper) were featured in Our Home alongside those schemes more\nevidently indebted to modernism. This not only reflected changing interior fashions\nmore generally, but also the new consumer freedoms in relation to colour and style which\nwere afforded by the larger flat sizes.\nClutter\nAs noted, the inaugural phase of housing provision by the HDB was undertaken in the\nname of a diagnosed housing crisis such that many of the earliest HDB provisions were\nvery small one-bedroom (23 m2) or two-bedroom (37 m2) `emergency' flats. Even the\nearliest `improved', `standard', and `new generation' flats could be relatively small.\nInternal space was always at a premium in early HDB offerings, and much of the advice\ngiven by way of Our Home was directed at solving the space problem with limited financial\noutlay. For example, almost all the articles on interior decoration in the first two years\nof Our Home advised readers to create a simple, low-cost, and uncluttered look in\ntheir newly acquired flats. This advice came by way of articles entitled: ``Simple and\nserene'' (1974); ``Simple and spacious'' (1997a, no page), ``Original taste yet economical''\n(1979, page 24); ``Simple arrangements'' (1978, page 21),``Simple, does it!'' (1981c, page 18);\n``All light and space'' (1975, page 8); and ``Keeping it simple'' (1981a, page 20) (figure 2).\nFigure 2. Selection of Our Home decorator articles, showing emphasis on space, simplicity, and\nstorage, as presented in the final issue (Our Home 1989b). \u00df Housing and Development Board,\nSingapore.\nInterior design and modernisation in post-independence Singapore 585In this context, what to do with `clutter' was a persistent concern. Indeed, in the\nadvice given about making an appropriate interior for HDB flats it was often assumed\nthat `design' and `clutter' were mutually exclusive terms. As Baker (1995, no page) has\nnoted, clutter takes ``revenge'' on design. What produced `clutter' varied in the pages of\nOur Home: furniture of inappropriate size or poorly arranged: inadequate storage\nspaces, and, of course, too many ornaments. Residents were routinely praised for\n``resisting ... all temptation to clutter'' (1978, page 21) and most of the articles deal in\none way or another with this problem. For example, in 1974 Mr Eng Siak Loy shared\nwith others his opinion of clutter:\n``I avoid cluttering the flat with bulky and fanciful furniture .... Most people are\ninclined to do that. However, if they want their flat to be spacious as well as\nattractive, they can easily create space by choosing the right kind of furniture and\narranging it in the right places'' (1974, page 38).\nAgain, in 1981 we visit the home of Mr Chou Kin Loong who also ``believes in keeping\nthings simple'':\n``No ornaments, none of the knick-knacks one usually finds in abundance in so\nmany other flats. Just simple, clean-cut furnishing which makes the flat more\ncomfortable than trendy, and a good example of wise budgeting'' (1981c, page 18).\nIn a similar vein we are introduced to the ``elegance'' of Mr Tan's flat within which\n``there is none of the usual ornamental flora and knick knacks that new home owners\nare wont to decorate their flats with'', and where ``only functional furniture greets\nthe visitor'' (1980a, page 18). And then there were newlyweds, Linda and Derrick\nFitzgerald, who simply ``don't believe in storing junk'' and only kept ``what they really\nneed'' (1973b, pages 21^22). In these examples the ethos of utility operated as a\ndefence against clutter.\nAs Cwerner and Metcalfe (2003, page 236) note, the elimination of clutter is not\nsimply produced by the choice not to ornament: it is also a product of how one deals\nwith the ``problem'' of objects that fall out of frequent use, and which are in need of\nhiding (storage). Storage, they argue, ``is key to understanding how people create order\nin the home and the world'' (page 229). Our Home articles showcased numerous\nresident-devised innovations for clever storage, including adding storage capacity to\nexisting furniture and fixtures. For example, a very early article advised residents as\nto how they could ``s-t-r-e-t-c-h that space'' by using the space above the television for\nstorage, or adding shelves to the back of doors, or fitting drawers below settees (1973c,\npages 15^16). Another resident advised readers to avoid, admittedly more economical,\n``readymade furniture''. His built-in unit, it was observed, ``both acts as a utility and\ndecorative item'', and ``as [it] has numerous compartments and cupboards, it cuts down\non clutter, as everything that was necessary but should be put out of sight was neatly\ntucked away in the cupboards'' (1977b, pages 21^22).\nOrnament\nAlthough obsessed with the `problem' of clutter, the HDB de \u00a8 cor advice did not con-\nsistently promote the elimination of ornament. Indeed, ornament was seen to have the\npower to deliver to domestic interiors a sense of ``personal touch''and ``atmosphere'' in\na manner that resonated quite remarkably with the very 19th-century European interior\nthat modernism shunned. Our Home articles encouraged residents to create, in modest\nand controlled ways, a range of theatrical and phantasmagorical effects. Many of the\ninteriors showcased, including those praised for their use of neutral tones and man-\nagement of clutter, used ornaments, wall and floor finishes and soft furnishings\nsuch as shag-pile rugs, plush carpeting, ``big comfy armchairs'', gold damask curtains,\n586 J M Jacobs, S Cairnschandeliers, even Victorian-look furniture. Take Dorothy Khoo's flat, which aspired to\n``have something different from the usual'':\n``home decorations include carved wood statuettes, ancient vases, Chinese porce-\nlain\u00f6most of which are prized collections of older generations. To counter-balance\nthese antiques of the Orient, decoupages, attractive pictures and a gilt-frame mirror\nadorn the walls'' (1979, page 25).\nAsian ornaments were commonly featured and articles described flats containing\nornamental objects such as a bamboo lamp from Jakarta, a bed in a `pseudo-Chinese'\nstyle, a Namdas Kashmiri rug, a painting of Malay women, Chinese calligraphic hang-\nings, batik paintings, and woodcarving. A good example was the flat of the Ng family,\nwhose ``exquisite display cabinet'' presented a``fascinating range of bric-a-brac that have\nFigure 3.

Again, the interior in this\nadvertisement combines certain features of a modernist aesthetic (white walls most\nnotably) along with a floor-to-ceiling photomontage of a wintry landscape, a mosaic\ncoffee table and lamp with Thai motifs, and a painting in traditional Balinese style\n(figure 3). It is clear from these examples, that the `Asian-ness' of these flats is not an\nexpression of some intrinsic cultural trait struggling to find expression against a\nmodernist architecture. Rather, it is a regionally inflected taste culture embedded in\nthe logics of consumption and within which originary cultural traits jostle with the\nartefacts and atmospheres of other Asias.\nIndeed, by the 1980s the way in which these eclectically oriental interiors were\ndescribed was almost oblivious to any design constraints that might exist by virtue of\nthe architecture. In an article explicitly entitled ``The flat where East meets West'' (Our\nHome 1980b, page 12) (figure 4) we are introduced to a householder who has deployed\n``the best of both worlds''. Having ``his roots in his past'', amateur artist Mr Leong used\n``oriental themes in his works of art'' and chose ``oriental ornaments to decorate his\nflat''. But what this article dubbed as the ``orientalism'' of this de \u00a8 cor was set against\n``Western furnishings'': a ``comfortable ... sofa and a glass display cabinet''. In 1987 this\ntheme was revisited by way of another flat in which there was ``a comfortable mix of\nmany cultures'': samurai sword, Chinese paintings, Italian dining setting, and ``knick-\nknacks from Europe''. According to the article, this worldly display was less a product\nof design than simply an assembly of the various wedding gifts bestowed upon this\nhousehold by their well-travelled relatives and friends. As the article concludes: ``After\na hard days work at the office, the Tohs are only too glad to come home to their\nFigure 4. ``The flat where East meets West'' (Our Home 1980b, page 12).\n\u00df Housing and Development Board, Singapore.\n588 J M Jacobs, S Cairnscomfortable haven with its distinctive mix `n' match de \u00a8 cor of East and West'' (1987,\npage 20).\nWe have already discussed the problem of storage in the earlier HDB interiors, but\nstorage is a system that is intended to deal with items that fall out of use (either\ntemporarily or permanently). The ornament requires a different structure of housing,\nfor as long as it is on display its visual work in producing atmospheric effect is never\ndone. While Singaporean housing emerged out of a modernism indifferent to display\nand ornament, the `space-sensible' display cabinet became an often-featured item in\nOur Home articles.They make it clear that the Singaporean interior was full of collections\nand curios of various kinds, all of which needed to be displayed. Mrs Meng, for example,\nchose to put her ``collection of odd pieces of beautiful crockery and pottery'' in a ``teak\nsideboard'' and a ``glass-fronted showcase in blackwood'' (1976b, page 26). Mr Wong,\nwhose bespoke furniture we have already seen, elected to use a wall unit that not only\nhid clutter, but also displayed``all the living room essentials like aTV set, stereo, books and\ncurios'' (1977b, page 22). This hybrid system of storage and display was aptly expressed\nthrough an article entitled, ``Hide and show''. The article features a kitchen renovation\nbased on built-in units which could be used, on the one hand, to hide unpleasant-to-\nlook-at kitchen utensils and ``odds and ends'' but, on the other hand, showcase those\nitems one would ``love to show'' on an ``elegant display shelf'' (1980c, page 14).\nIn the final years of the interior decoration articles in Our Home, the drift toward\nan ever-more ornamented interior, reminiscent of the very European interiors which\nmodernism deplored, appeared almost complete. In an article entitled ``The Continental\nstyle'' (1985), a home was featured in which, on entering, the visitor was ``transported at\nonce to the atmosphere of a house in a small town in Europe''and brought back ``to the\ntimes of King Louis the fourteenth''. The owner, Mr Chan, himself imported European\nfurniture\u00f6no doubt servicing a growing local market. In another home featured we\nencountered the very first interior that was acknowledged not to be the product of\nthe creativity of its owners but the ``Italian-style'' vision of a ``renovation contractor''\n(1989a, pages 28^29). But perhaps the stylistic destiny of the Singapore interior is best\nsummarised by the last of the de \u00a8 cor features to appear in the final edition of Our Home,\npublished in August\/September 1989. In a feature entitled ``Vast variations'' (1989b,\npages 29^30), two HDB homes are featured: one based on a ``hi-tech'' minimalism but\nincorporating the ``folly'' of a reproduction London phone booth; the other a heavily\nornamented interior that made it ``just like a cottage housed in a HDB flat'' (figure 5).\nWhile modernity's progressive drive seems to be elegantly and effortlessly demonstrated\nthroughout the urban spaces of this city-state\u00f6in civic and commercial architecture,\npublic squares and precincts, transportation systems, and service infrastructures\u00f6\nhere in the HDB domestic interior we find a more telling, dialectical image of\nSingapore's modernity in which past and future, East and West, are locked together\nin an anachronistic embrace.\nManaging atmosphere\nThroughout these articles on interior de \u00a8 cor the presence of the resident decorator\noperated to confuse the boundary between state prescription, professionalised design\nstyle, and individual expression. In the Our Home articles this was often encapsulated\nin the positively inflected term ``individuality'', and elaborated with terms like ``crea-\ntivity'', ``originality'' and ``imagination''. Many of the featured residents themselves\nembodied the notion of the ``artistic'' and ``creative'' resident, occasionally being pro-\nfessional ``designers'' of one kind or another, or more usually residents with ``amateur''\nart hobbies who were able to report on their own inexpensive DIYefforts to add creative\nInterior design and modernisation in post-independence Singapore 589touches to their homes (fabric hangings, macrame \u00a8, mosaic tabletops, paintings, murals,\netc). As one article concludes:\n``Creating a complete and fulfilling furnishing scheme isn't strictly conditioned by\nyour capacity to write out large cheques .... Successful decoration is just as depend-\nent on thoughtful planning, awareness of colour and that touch of individuality\nwhich totally transforms a room'' (1980b, page 12).\nBut the principles of individuality written into the HDB interior rest on a finely\nbalanced ratio of decorating action to atmospheric effect. The exemplary cases that\nfeature in Our Home all represent specified taste incursions that are expressed in\nconsistently modest terms\u00f6``touches'', ``spots'' and ``accents''. These incursions become\neffective (that is, appropriate) marks of individuality only if they can be shown to have\npositive effect on the atmosphere of the whole room or flat.The excessive application of\ntoo dark or ``heavy''a colour, or the excessive display of ornament, in a flat is deemed an\nFigure 5. ``Vast variations'' (Our Home1989b, pages 29^30). \u00dfHousing and Development Board,\nSingapore.\n590 J M Jacobs, S Cairnsill-judged design decision as it compromises the sense of space and openness of the\ninterior.\nFurthermore, the encouragment of acts of individuality in relation to HDB interiors\nwas in stark contrast to the kinds of expression allowed in relation to the exterior of the\nHDB blocks and estates. Resident changes to the external fabric of HDB flats and\nblocks have always been prohibited. Within HDB publications there is little explicit\nreflection on the reasons for such prohibitions, and certainly what reflection there is\nlinks it directly to practical questions of structural integrity and safety, as opposed to a\ncommitment to a modern aesthetic. Indeed, as the design history of housing provision\nby the HDB testifies, the HDB quickly moved from a commitment to a purist mod-\nernist aesthetic in external design to a range of managed interventions directed at\nbestowing upon individual estates a unique identity.With the original modernist blocks,\nthis included painting giant murals onto the exterior walls and, later, adding on certain\nexternal features, such as prefabricated ornamental panels, distinctive rooflines, and\ncoloured building materials. But for all this external expression, the emergent visual\n`diversity'of the HDB fabric remained firmly in the hands of HDB architects, working\nin conjunction with the Prefabrication Technology Centre. Each time Singaporean\nhomeowners deliberately or incidentally `expressed' themselves on the exterior of the\nbuilding this solicited the attention of the HDB, activating existing regulatory regimes\nor generating alternate design solutions in next-generation estates. For example, in the\nname of health and safety, a suite of regulations forbade residents from suspending\nobjects from the balcony areas or cultivating plants in open corridor spaces. Similarly,\nthe drying of clothes by way of distinctive bamboo rods extended from the buildings has\nbeen managed by the state with increasing intensity over the years. Initially, the very\nvisible rod drying technology was provided for on the rear of blocks but, as time went\non, rods were secreted in external recesses designed specifically to hide washing from\nthe exterior of the buildings. Similarly, the visual dilemma produced by a proliferation\nof individual household television aerials was resolved in the late 1960s by the installa-\ntion of collective aerials. It would seem that in the Singapore housing system individual\nexpression has its limits, and that limit is contained within the interior.\nConclusion\nThe role of the interior in the development of a homeowning democracy in post-\nindependence Singapore reminds us that aesthetic debates about interiors implicate\nfar more than matters of style. The modernist style, although based on and aspiring\ntowards universally applicable design principles, was a situated production\u00f6in terms\nboth of its `ideals' and of its various `realities'. Linked as it was to more widely\nconceived reforms, it was readily absorbed into a variety of political and social\nprojects\u00f6including that of Singapore's post-independence programme to house a\nnation. In this practical enactment of the modern style, the interior came into being\nby way of a complex dialogue between the modernisms evident on drawing boards,\nthose articulated in political rhetoric, those modelled in displays or captured in maga-\nines, those constructed by bureaucracy, and those aspired to by residents. In this\nsense, the practical making of the modern home in Singapore (as elsewhere) was a\nmultimedia event.\nIn the post-independence housing programme of Singapore, modernist style\nmeshed with `disciplinary modernisation' (Wee, 2001) and the `discipline of the market'\n(Chua, 1997). In this system aesthetic elements and the look of the interior played\na special role within a wider developmental drive, acting both as a source of and as a\nsetting for change. Modernist highrise housing came to be one of the key sites through\nwhich the post-independence Singaporean subject was made and made themselves.\nInterior design and modernisation in post-independence Singapore 591The Singaporean state played a significant role in this process, advising as it did on style\nand determining physical and aesthetic limits to the extent of creative expression. Yet the\nnovice homeowner enthusiastically played a part too, carefully modelling newly acquired\ninteriors to their own aspirations. Indeed, we hope that this paper has shown how the\ncultivation of the interior became central to the `covenant' between people and state.(3)\nThe articles in Our Home do not simply deliver a formula for creating modern\ninteriors: they also furnish residents with the `taste' equipment necessary to manage\nthe consumption opportunities delivered into their hands by this new form of housing.\nOur Home sought, then, to develop the ``personal capacities'' of subjects to be ``entre-\npreneurs of the self'' (Flint, 2003, page 614). In this sense, the modern Singaporean\ninterior was a product of the micropolitics of state, subjectivity and built form. In this\nprocess of governing the Singaporean interior, it was transformed into a place where\nindividual creative expression was at once cultivated and contained. As the pages of\nOur Home show, interior creativity needed to be carefully calibrated, such that the\naesthetic and economic investments it entailed did not become excessive.\nIn finally concluding we reflect back again to the HDB Gallery display which gave\nsuch prominence to the interior through its staged recreations of Singaporean interiors,\nold and new. The story there began with a `premodern' kampung interior, and moved\ninexorably towards contemporary display flats. The early kampung interior appears\nutterly out of place and of another time compared with the domestic culture of con-\ntemporary Singapore. Indeed, Cogito Image the `space-branding' firm that designed\nand installed the display, admitted that its designers had to travel to Malaysia to source\nthe props for this display. It is easy when faced with such evidence (be it the front stage\nor backstage version of it) to script Singaporean modernism as an alien force, displac-\ning, even erasing, local domestic forms. But our account has sought to counteract both\ndevelopmentalist stories of modernisation and nostalgic stories of loss. The prescribed\nmodern Singaporean interior does not simply confirm a global story of the spread of\nmodernism. Nor does the practised interior signal a simplistic return of tradition.\nRather, the post-independence Singaporean interior embodies an alternative modernity,\nthe alterity of which is not based in any simple way on the (re)emergence of a so-called\nAsian interior. The evidence from Our Home suggests that the post-independence\nSingaporean homemaker, encouraged by the state, assembled interiors modelled out\nof meshing the professional with DIY, the new with the inherited, the modern with the\ntraditional, the global with the local. Indeed, the modern Singaporean interior was\noften a fantasy creation drawing both on past times and on other places. Within these\ninteriors, any `Asian-ness' evident was not linked to a residual or resistant cultural\npresence, but to consumer patterns which mixed and matched objects sourced in\nvarious Asian and Southeast Asian localities with local interpretations of European\ninteriors, both modern and traditional. Indeed, the alterity of Singapore's modern-\nism lies firmly in its willingness to accommodate the very type of ornamented and\nphantasmagorical interior styling with which its European predecessor could not live.\nAcknowledgements.

These confusions are worthy of further attention in their own right.\n592 J M Jacobs, S CairnsReferences\nAttfield J, 1989,``Inside pram town: a case study of Harlow house interiors,1951^61'', in AView\nfrom the Interior:Women and Design Eds J Attfield, P Kirkham (TheWomen's Press, London)\npp 215^238\nAttfield J,1999,``Bringing modernityhome: open plan in the British domestic interior'', in At Home:\nSpace, Place and Society Ed.
