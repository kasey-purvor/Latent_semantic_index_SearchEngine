In South Africa, where state planning directs the course of \nchange while attempting to privilege the market, brokers do not merely negotiate between fixed \npositionalities of \u2018state\/market\u2019 and \u2018people\u2019. Instead, they embody and bring into being socio-\neconomic positions and identities. They blend together the egalitarianism and rights-based \ncharacter of post-liberation society with the hierarchy of re-emerging traditional authority. \nDrawing on notions of consensus they embody \u2018the people\u2019, drawing on ideas of free choice and \nenterprise they embody \u2018the market\u2019. Simultaneously they bear the bureaucratic characteristics \nof \u2018the state\u2019. \n \n \n \nSettings of rapid transition, where state planning attempts to direct the course of change but \ndoes so in a way that foregrounds the influences of the market, have laid the grounds for a re-\nemergence of brokerage. Brokers and mediators use assets furnished by the state and provide \nthe means for others, less able, to gain access to these. They benefit materially while \nsimultaneously developing followings of others who hope to do so. New forms of identification \nare produced even as brokers mediate between old ones.  These key figures emerge in social \nsituations which they, in part, have helped to mould. Particular styles are drawn on and new \nsocio-economic positions brought into being. \n \nThe context of post-apartheid South Africa, like many transitional settings elsewhere, is one in \nwhich elements of state, market, and patrimonial\/patriarchal-style political authority intersect. \nAspects of  \u2018neo-liberal\u2019 (or \u2018millennial\u2019) capitalism are prevalent, with many enriching \nthemselves and becoming upwardly mobile while others become inexorably poorer (J and JL \nComaroff 2000). Tempering this, state intervention, much of it based upon a version of state \nwelfarism inherited from the apartheid order, plays a key role. Increased levels of \nunemployment associated with market liberalisation have made many people dependent upon \npensions, disability or child support grants: crucial sources of income in a highly monetized \neconomy. The welfarist order or \u2018distributional regime\u2019 (Seekings and Nattrass 2005), has thus \nendured, even intensified, rather than precipitously collapsing.  \n \nState intervention, as well as effecting redistribution, has been the key factor in attempting to \nprivilege the market as a central driver of economic and social life. Where members of the new \nmiddle classes, for example, have started to enrich themselves via entrepreneurial activity or \ninvolvement in business, this has been possible only as a result of a government policy of \u2018black \neconomic empowerment\u2019 which has been minutely regulated, with rafts of new legislation \nhaving been passed in recent years. Much further down the social scale, the poor people who are \nthe intended beneficiaries of redressive and redistributive measures are expected to legitimate \ntheir claims by couching these in terms of  elaborate and often unrealisable \u2018business plans\u2019. \nAlongside all this, insecurities have led people to place renewed faith in traditionalism and \npatriarchal-style political authority (Koelble and LiPuma 2005; Oomen 2005).  \n 2 \n \nThese different and unevenly blended elements not only provide the context in which brokers \nemerge, but also furnish the bricoleurs\u2019 hybrid \u2018toolkit\u2019 from which such figures construct their \nidentities. Brokers are not only products, but also producers, of the kind of society in which they \nre-emerge. They blend together egalitarianism and rights-based concerns with the hierarchical \npolitical authority of traditional leaders and patriarchs, while simultaneously foregrounding the \neconomic individualism and choice-orientation associated with neo-liberalism. Drawing on \nnotions of consensus, they embody the local concerns of ordinary people, drawing on ideas of \nfree choice and competition they embody \u2018the market\u2019. Simultaneously, they endorse and \nembody some of the bureaucratic characteristics of \u2018the state\u2019 which provides a legitimating \nframework for these merged - but often contradictory \u2013 frameworks. \n \nInevitably, the combining of such unlike attributes presents a picture of moral uncertainty. The \ntwo such figures described below - Jack Mtsweni and Amos Mathibela -  were heroic in their \nresourceful creativity delivering something tangible to a disenfranchised class of landless poor. \nAt the same time, they could be seen as hustlers, exploiting marginalized people to enrich \nthemselves and enhance their status. This moral ambiguity has been present throughout several \ndecades of scholarly discussion of brokerage.  \n \nThe anthropology of brokerage and clientelism \n \nTies of dependency and clientelism have been variously analysed, celebrated and decried by \ngenerations of scholars. Patron client relations preoccupied political anthropologists analysing \nlate colonial and newly-independent countries: particularly those with an interest in individual \naction, such as the members of the Manchester school (Gluckman 1955; Long 1968). Where \npeasants and elites or \u2018great\u2019 and \u2018little\u2019 traditions (Redfield 1956) were newly juxtaposed in \nsettings of transition, some groups or individuals acquired the status of patrons on the basis of \ntheir new access to economic and or political resources, while others mediated between these \nfigures and those lower down in the pecking order, often bridging these separate worlds while \nsimultaneously deriving benefits from keeping them some distance apart. What underpinned \nsuch relationships was the fact that clients abdicated their potentially open access to the state \nand\/or major markets in order to gain mediated access via a patron (Eisenstadt and Roniger \n1980; Randeraad 1998).  \n \nWhen these and other studies of \u2018local level politics\u2019 ran into a \u2018dead-end\u2019 (Spencer 1997), this \nwas both because Marxist scholars disparaged accounts of individual transaction, and because \nthe imposition of political power in the modern state \u2013 with its accompanying forms of \nentrenched private property rights and the like - appeared to have lessened the possibilities for \nmanoeuvre of any kind (Mitchell 1990). Where such possibilities did exist, scholars analysing \nthem were condemned for failing to recognize the importance of political\/economic structural \nconstraints. The scholarly war between consensus models and those emphasising structural \ninequalities was largely driven by ideological difference. In a well-known debate, Barth\u2019s claim \nthat intermediaries canvassed political support on behalf of Pakhtun landowners who were thus \ndependent upon them to build a power base (1965) was repudiated by Asad (1972). Such \nconsensus or \u2018market models\u2019, argued Asad, downplayed the fact that political authority was in \nfact derived from pre-existing factors such as the ownership of landed property.  \n \nThis line of argument was animated by a conviction that the \u2018choice\u2019 allegedly exercised by \nmaximizing brokers and mediators was an ideological construct which overly privileged \nindividualist frameworks (Alavi 1973) and obscured darker realities (Silverman 1974). Taking a \n 3 \nless condemnatory line, and one more intellectually attractive than the methodological \nindividualism of scholars in the Manchester school because of its focus on group practices and \nideas, was Scott\u2019s work on Malaysia (1972a; 1972b; 1976). Peasants in modernizing contexts \nmade appeals to their patrons by appealing to a \u2018moral economy\u2019, deriving from their \ndependency upon these patrons in earlier periods (1976). Reappraising Scott\u2019s work, Mitchell \nnotes however that although personalized relations remained crucial in political and economic \nlife, practices earlier mediated by such relations and by a redistributive ethic appeared to have \nbeen placed \u2018outside the play of local relations\u2019 (1990). He shows how - given the advent of \ncapitalism and the emergence of a modern state - power now appeared to emanate from \nsomewhere beyond even though it was still exercised locally and felt with immediate effect, and \npower relations now appeared fixed and permanent rather than being personalized and \nfluctuating.  \n \nWhere, for Scott, these bonds of dependence provided the basis for positive and \u2018moral\u2019 forms \nof action, some anthropologists, having a sound grasp of the structural underpinnings of such \nrelationships, had been more critical. The self-perpetuating character of patronage in Sicily was \nexamined by Boissevain (1966) and later Blok (1988), who showed how many of the conditions \nfor which the peasantry needed assistance actually arose because of the patronage\/ brokerage \nsystem or were at least sustained by it; and how patrons, brokers and intermediaries, by \nexploiting difficulties of access, were simultaneously weakening the system of government. \nSimilar patronage has been widely documented in Africa, where it has been shown to underlie \ncorruption, the failure of development resources to reach their intended targets, and the inability \nof the poorest people to access the rights of the ordinary citizen (Hyden 1995; Mwenda and \nTangri 2005).  \n \nThe borderline legality, or downright criminality, of brokerage is one of its problems. But some \ncelebrate rather than condemning this feature. Writers on popular culture draw attention to the \nperformative skills of \u2018cultural brokers\u2019 (Barber 1987; see also Geertz 1960) who creatively \ninterweave diverse social and cultural threads in settings of rapid change and urbanisation. \nGiven the disintegration of traditional frameworks and the impossibility of reconciling new \ncapitalist value systems with the need for self-respect in a dehumanising society, these figures \nmust live by their wits (La Hausse 1993). They have little option but to use get-rich-quick schemes \nto make a living, climbing the social ladder while defrauding others as they do so (ibid.).  \n \nMore recently, analysts of development contexts have recognized the ubiquity and inevitability \nof such brokers, indicating the need to analyse the phenomenon rather than condemn it (Mosse \nand Lewis 2006). In settings where new opportunities may be seized and existing statuses \ntransformed, actors construct social contexts, enrolling and juxtaposing a variety of elements. \nOne means by which this is done is by the act of \u2018translating\u2019 between previously unintelligible \nregisters. \u2018Actors assume identities in relation to their strategies of interaction \u2026 through a \nprocess of \u2018translation\u2019 that permits the negotiation of common meanings and definitions and \nthe mutual enrolment and co-optation into individual and collective objectives and activities\u2019 \n(Latour 2000, cited in Mosse and Lewis 2006:14). Rural and marginalized people\u2019s personal \ndependencies may well have been obscured by new fixities of state and market as Mitchell \nclaims (1990). Such people nonetheless remain crucially reliant on intermediaries to enunciate \ntheir demands and claims. In South Africa, former farm-dwellers, evicted from white-owned \nfarms as so-called \u2018surplus people\u2019 during the 1970s, and belonging economically in the lowest \nincome decile, have puzzled analysts by failing to represent themselves politically or to unite in \ndefence of their own rights \u2013 especially that of acquiring land, whether for cultivation or simply \nas a secure place to live after having been summarily evicted from these farms (Seekings and \n 4 \nNattrass 2005). Instead of organising directly, they remain reliant on ties of dependency similar \nto those analyzed by Scott, but the increasing prevalence of market forces has added an extra \nlayer to the terrain of complexity which they need to negotiate. Brokers, often emerging from \ntheir midst, draw on, creatively mediate, and translate between these varied and often \ncontradictory styles and modes of being. \n \nBackground and setting: Land reform in the Mpumalanga\/Limpopo borderlands \n \nIt was for members of this group \u2013 both the \u2018surplus people\u2019 who had already left the white \nfarms in the 1970s to settle in the former homelands, and those still living on these farms but \nwithout secure tenure \u2013 that South Africa\u2019s new legislators and policy makers, post-1994, \ndesigned a land reform programme as a system both of redress and of redistribution (James \n2007; Walker 2008). Aware of the probability that new forms of wealth would attract \u2018big men\u2019 \nor brokers in search of a following, they tried to design impartial processes of land access that \nwould put citizens directly in touch with the state and thereby block such opportunists. The \nconventional wisdom on land access in Africa (Berry 2002; Lund 2002) shows how social \nconnections outweigh formal titling in importance: but in South Africa, with its centralized \nplanning and effective formal legal system, and where the state \u2013 as much after as before \napartheid\u2019s demise \u2013 has tried to exercise control over land transfer and distribution, there was a \ndetermination to counter these tendencies. To this end, new edifices of social engineering \nclassified people into types and proposed corresponding kinds of property ownership. But the \nconstruction of these putative social categories, the accompanying models of property-\nownership \u2013 and, in contradictory combination with these, the ultimate reliance on market \nforces to achieve the work of planning \u2013 provided new spaces and new repertoires for \nentrepreneurial brokerage.  \n \nThe context of my fieldwork, conducted in the Mpumalanga\/Limpopo borderlands in 2002-3, \nwas one of an earlier population displacement for which recompense was now being planned, \nvia land reform: one of the intensive planning activities which underlay South Africa\u2019s \ntransition from an apartheid to a democratic state. The programme attempted to combine moral \nand material aims. It tried to balance the redress of specific past injustices against the fulfilling \nof demands for broader socio-economic redistribution, thus achieving (1) the restoration of \nproperty\/citizenship rights; (2) the solving of economic problems and ameliorating of rural \npoverty; and (3) the establishment of a class of viable African farmers. These divergent aims \nwere equally ranked at an early stage of the land reform program, but the government\u2019s \nsubsequent shift towards liberalisation has seen the market-oriented approach gain more \nheadway. The varied tendencies nonetheless continue to combine in often unexpected and \ncontradictory ways. \n \nHistories of dispossession and settlement: the 1960s and 1970s \nUndoing the injustices and inequalities of more than a century proved to be a complex task. The \nmost disruptive episode, and the one most difficult to reverse, was the population displacement \nof the 1960s-70s. In Mpumalanga, Africans who had lived on white farms as tenant-cultivators \nmoved off in large numbers (they continue to do so, in lesser numbers, in the present). Their \neviction, although mostly not forceful, was the result of efforts by a powerful white farmer \nlobby pursuing economic rationalization. In close parallel, apartheid state policy carved the area \ninto \u2018black\u2019 and \u2018white\u2019 zones, establishing South Africa\u2019s much-disparaged tribal \u2018homelands\u2019 \nas the place where such former tenants would in future reside, under the rule of chiefs on state-\nowned land (Surplus People Project 1983). With reference to the map, Africans were being \ndisplaced from white South Africa\u2019s south-eastern Transvaal (now Mpumalanga Province), \n 5 \nnorthwards across the Steelpoort (Tubatse) River to the then Lebowa homeland (now Limpopo \nProvince). Swathes of the countryside were being depopulated while others were repopulated in \nover the course of less than a decade. \n \n \nFigure 1: Map of Mpumalanga, showing relocation, restitution and redistribution sites \n \nIn the period of greatest upheaval, and despite the apartheid state\u2019s attempt to formalize \narrangements by settling all displaced people in the state-owned homelands, negotiated access \nto and ownership of land was of key importance for uprooted tenants (Wotshela 2001). \u2018Like \nbirds in the cornfield\u2019 (Stadler 1979) they sought out places to settle, in defiance of state plans, \noften impermanently and usually in search of a close to jobs and other resources (Marcus, Eales \nand Wildschut 1996). Some of these displaced tenants, instead of moving into the homelands as \nstate policy dictated, sought refuge instead on African-owned land within what were technically \n\u2018white\u2019 areas.  \n \n 6 \nThe farm Doornkop was one such piece of land. Taking advantage of a brief window of political \nopportunity, its owners - a small group of African titleholders, sePedi-speaking mission \nconverts - had originally purchased it from a white owner in the first decade of the twentieth \ncentury (see Figure 2). During the late 1960s, the farm gradually acquired a tenantry of \nsiNdebele-speakers who had been evicted from surrounding white farms. These displacement \nprocesses, cruel to begin with, were even more brutally interrupted in 1974 when Doornkop\u2019s \ninhabitants \u2013 titleholders and tenants alike - were subject to apartheid\u2019s most violent episode of \nsocial engineering: a \u2018black spot\u2019 forced removal using army trucks (James 1983).1 Despite this \nmoment of rupture, the patterns of land-based clientelism established here would later re-\nemerge, through the activities of new brokers. This, then, is the setting for the drama of \nbrokerage and land-seeking described in the present paper. \n \n \nFigure 2: Doornkop group photograph with Pentecostal missionaries, 1910 (photo \nMcDonald family) \n \n 7 \n \nFigure 3: Pages from Doornkop log book showing contributions to farm purchase in cash \nor kind (in possession of McDonald family) \n \n \nA note is necessary here on how ethnic difference relates to the landowner-tenant divide. \nAlthough Doornkop\u2019s original Christian owners were exclusively sePedi speakers, the tenantry \nliving on surrounding white farms until their eviction included sePedi and siNdebele speakers, \nstrongly conscious of their differences. Ndebele were considered backward, more traditional, \nless well educated \u2013 but with more entrepreneurial capacity (taxi drivers, builders, etc.) - while \nPedi were represented as better-educated but poor, usually following well-established migrant \ntrajectories into industrial employment (James 1990). For complex historical reasons, greater \nnumbers of Pedi had converted to Christianity, and a small but significant number had \npurchased farm land in the early years of the twentieth century, becoming titleholders. It was \nPedi in the latter group that owned the farm Doornkop. But Ndebele have been and remain in \nthe majority in the region: a matter which had a significant influence on state policy after South \nAfrica\u2019s transition. Although the ANC, in power after 1994, had earlier drawn its most \ninfluential constituents and its leadership at national level from the ranks of mission converts \nlike the Pedi titleholders, members of the small, and new, Ndebele elite were now being given \nnew positions of power or civil service jobs in the region (and they in turn had started to \nmobilize new sets of alliances and loyalties, primarily on ethnic lines). In the early 2000s, then, \nthe ANC government began to be attentive at local level to the electoral power of the Ndebele \nmajority (James 2007:105-29). Such attentiveness was one factor impeding any possibility of \ninterfering with the patterns of brokerage described below.  \n \nPlanned redress: the 1990s and 2000s \nMy research investigated how historical patterns of racially-based relocation were being \noverturned by state policy and planning. First, farms in Mpumalanga Province (squares on map \nin Figure 1) - both those formerly owned by African title-holders and occupied by them and \ntheir tenants, and those occupied by African tenants on white farms \u2013 became the object of \n 8 \nrestitution claims by their former occupants.2 In making policy to govern this process, a law \nwas passed to regulate the holding of \u2018communal property\u2019, stipulating the transfer of ownership \nof farms to their former owners conceptualized as \u2018communities\u2019. In some cases it transferred \nresponsibility for development, social services, and the adjudication of disputes to elected \ncommittees, thus abrogating liability for, even effectively outsourcing, these processes.3  \n \nAt the time of research \u2013 and even several years later - restitution was still mostly under way. \nClaimants, many of them labour migrants working in or near Johannesburg, still had their rural \ndomiciles in the villages of what is now known as Limpopo Province (formerly the homeland of \nLebowa, to which they had originally been displaced) while they waited for the outcome of their \nclaims. Indeed, the land reform programme as a whole has tended to have this character: that of \na process much planned for, with outcomes eagerly awaited but never achieved. (In only in one \ncase I investigated, that of Doornkop, had restitution been accomplished and had some \nclaimants moved back by the time of my fieldwork.) Meanwhile, tenants and farm-dwelling \nworkers were still being evicted from white farms and seeking for places to live. Many had \nreturned to \u2018squat\u2019 illegally on the African-owned land where they had resided before 1974, \nwhile others had newly arrived at such places. Former tenants, no longer forced northwards \nacross the border as they had been by the apartheid authorities, were now seeking refuge instead \nin informal settlements on the land of African titleholders. Both originals and new arrivals, \nseeking land for cultivation, grazing, and for rent-free residence in close proximity to the town \nof Middelburg, had come to live at Doornkop. The impact of achieving restitution for one farm \nwas having unplanned ramifications.  \n \nIn addition to restitution, state policy established other means of land access: redistribution and \ntenure reform, intended to secure or safeguard the land rights of those who had never formerly \nowned property of any kind \u2013 such as the tenants in question.4 Redistribution allowed displaced \npeople to settle on formerly white farms (stars on the map, Figure 1), but it did so in a manner \nwhich combined forces of state and market in an uneasy manner. The World Bank\u2019s \u2018willing \nbuyer\/willing seller\u2019 model was set to be realized in practice via a scheme of government grants \nfor individual families (a Settlement Land Acquisition Grant\/SLAG of R16,000 - about \u00a31,600 \nat the time of research). Purchase of land from \u2018sellers\u2019 was possible only if these grants were \npooled, which led, in many cases, to the recruiting by elites of new settlers purely on the basis \nthat their grants, once combined, would allow for the acquisition of a suitably-sized farm. Such \nstrategically-mobilised groups, derogatorily described as \u2018rent-a-crowds\u2019, often found it was \nunsustainable to live on the land to whose purchase they had contributed: it would then revert \nby default to the original initiator. As some of these contradictions were resolved, redistribution, \ninitially designed in the interests of poorer people, began to be oriented towards the provision of \nland for those with greater resources who could utilize them to continue or to create a \ncommercial farm venture.  \n 9 \n \nFigure 4: South African land reform legislation \n \nIn sum, the policy framework and accompanying legislation explicitly aimed to recognize the \nexistence of separate kinds of persons with different kinds of rights. In so doing, it implicitly \nseparated the types of moral action which accompanied these: historically-based redress, on the \none hand, and egalitarian-style justice framed to address present-day inequalities, on the other.  \nThe former was less, the latter more, egalitarian in intent. But the distinction between these \ndifferent aspects and categories of people was blurred. As people aspired to claim land, \ndifferent constituencies had differential recourse to the restitutive and redistributive aspects, \nsometimes pitting them against each other in a series of disputes in which different kinds of \nmoral claims relating to property were made. There were loopholes \u2013 allowing aspirant farmers \n 10 \nwith no former basis on the land to try to prove dubious connections to it through restitution, \nwhile others with a genuine sense of entitlement recognized the difficulties of proving this and \nattempted to benefit from redistribution instead.  And while the state moved in a more market-\noriented direction for land redistribution it nonetheless subsidised land restitution at a \npreviously unimagined scale, which involved providing expensive land for free to land \nclaimants and, later, barring them from mortgaging or selling the land (see Fay and James \n2009). \n \nFurther complexity was evident in the way that one arm of the programme was called upon to \nsolve problems caused by the other. In the case of the African-owned farm of Doornkop, a \nredistribution project was designed to solve the tenant\/squatter \u2018problem\u2019 which had arisen from \nthe earlier restitution episode. \n \nThis was the confusing framework, of policy\/practice, and of state-\/market-driven approaches, \nwith which ordinary people were confronted when they tried to become beneficiaries of land \nreform. While land access remained a matter of key importance for much of the electorate - \ngetting land back, or land at all, was one of the things they claim to have been promised by \nMandela and for which they voted for in South Africa\u2019s first elections - the exact mechanism of \nland access, and hence the precise way in which property is held, has been a matter of dispute.  \nIf one model has come to foreground the private ownership of property (albeit by \u2018communities\u2019 \nand under the governance of committees as legislated by the state), another - increasingly \nfavoured by some of the rank-and-file landless, and often (ironically) using apartheid\u2019s former \nhomelands as a model - has idealized land as an inalienable possession which ought not to be \nprivately owned or sold, but which should be owned by a very different kind of \u2018community\u2019: \nunder chiefly custodianship.  \n \nBrokers and mediators have found a repertoire in the contested space between these two \nincreasingly divergent models or ideologies of property-ownership. These models do not \nnecessarily correspond to people\u2019s own former or existing statuses as either \u2018owners\u2019 or \n\u2018tenants\u2019 respectively. In settings of rapid transition, policy initiatives and planned social change \nare productive of new social, cultural and political identities as well as simply acting upon pre-\nexisting ones. Redressive policies of reform promise to equalise inequalities or transcend socio-\neconomic categories, classes or identities, while market-driven approaches appear destined \neventually to reconstitute or strengthen these. But such policies and approaches also mediate and \ntransform these inequalities, classes and identities, in the very process of coming into being. \nBrokers play a key role in this process. \n \nThe case studies presented below show how, in postcolonial settings characterized by new \nforms of inequality, political life continues (or has newly begun) to be structured by forms of \npersonalized dependence. Brokers, even while pursuing their own advantage in what often looks \nlike a parody of \u2018free market\u2019 behaviour and simultaneously attempting to take up new positions \nin the socio-political order, promise plausible opportunities for their followers. They cobble \ntogether a collection of divergent discourses and practices, both for their own profit and to \ndeliver a series of apparently irreconcilable resources to his clients; more equitable outcomes; \nmore reassuringly authoritative styles of leadership; and the \u2018choice\u2019 and opportunity of the \nmarket.  \n \n 11 \n\u2018King Mtsweni\u2019 the land-seller \nOn the restored farm Doornkop, titleholder Jack Mtsweni5 sought to legitimate his land-\nbrokering deals in the eyes of his clientele by cloaking himself in the mantle of chiefly \nauthority. A descendant of the original Pedi owners (but child of a Zulu father), he had started \nselling small plots, without the permission of his fellow title-holders and in defiance of the \nofficial restitution model of communal ownership,6 to Ndebele tenants. Other discourses and \npositionalities were also invoked: in addition to his titleholder status which had entitled him to \nbe a beneficiary of restitution, his ethnically mixed family background, and his intimate \nacquaintance with the farm\u2019s chiefly family (now discredited in the eyes of titleholders but not \ntheir tenants), it was his knowledge of the egalitarian spirit of the Constitution of the \u2018new South \nAfrica\u2019 which furnished a touchstone of moral justification. \n \nIn accounting for the fact that he had invited Ndebele tenants, such as Jan Masina (Figure 5), onto \nthe farm and sold plots to them, Mtsweni\u2019s claims echoed tenants\u2019 own endorsement of the model \nwhich had formerly operated during apartheid, in the homeland areas.  As one tenant said \nWe want land to be under government control and that is where we want to stay.  If the \nplace is under government, it can always assist us in times of need.  If the place is my \nproperty, I will have to provide everything for myself, such as buying this and that. I don\u2019t \nwant that.  I want the government to tell me:  \u2018stay here, there is water, your house, your \ntoilet\u2019. \n \nThis was a model of ownership which had been established only during the 1930s and 1940s \n(Murray 1992:132) but had by now become firmly entrenched as the \u2018customary African\u2019 \npractice.  \n \n \nFigure 5: Squatter leader and one of Mtsweni\u2019s customers, Jan Masina (photo Deborah \nJames) \n \nMtsweni had been assaulted, and a charge had been laid against him, for his land-selling practices, \nand for the opposition to the practice of private\/exclusive land ownership which this implied.  His \ntitleholder neighbours, like M O Mohlala, insisted that the new democratic dispensation did not \n 12 \nautomatically guarantee all landless a place to settle, and that the rights of title-holders must be \nrespected: \nDoornkop is a private land - a bought land. \u2026 They have got this wrong. They are \ntrespassing - this is private property.\u2026 \n \nBut Mtsweni asserted that his land-brokering practices were in line with the principles of the \nnew political order; especially inasmuch as they embodied that new order\u2019s injunctions against \nsegregation on grounds of race or ethnicity: \nPeople have been thrown off farms, they're suffering.  As a black person I can't allow a \nfellow black to suffer, so I help them to come here. The national government doesn't \nbelieve in keeping people separate, so why should we keep them separate here?  \n \nEndorsing the arrival of these tenants, Mtsweni thus justified his welcoming stance in the name \nof the egalitarianism of post-1994 South Africa. Despite this apparent dedication to a forward-\nlooking and democratic ideology, however, he was accused by fellow titleholders of pandering \nto tenants\u2019 alleged respect for traditional authority. His appeal as a broker lay in his blending of \ndivergent attributes. Apparently contradictorily, he combined the trappings of custom with a \ncommitment to ethnic non-discrimination. \n \nHis assuming of a chiefly persona was done more on the basis of a borrowed authority, \nhowever, than in his own right. It was the community\u2019s absentee chief, he claimed, who had \ngiven him leave to allocate plots on Doornkop. And it was his close association with this chief \u2013 \nnot yet returned to the farm but living elsewhere - that had attracted so many farm evictees to \nflock to the farm in the first place. His chiefly connections, although allegedly lending him \nauthority in the eyes of his clientele among the Ndebele rural landless (typified as adhering to \ncustomary ways and as respectful of authority), disqualified him amongst the church-going Pedi \ntitleholders to whose ranks he belonged. In this as in many other \u2018black spot\u2019 forced removals, \nthe compliance of the then chief in the original resettlement had led to her fellow titleholders\u2019 \nrejection of her, and of all chiefs, in principle, as collaborators (James 1983, Mulaudzi 2002).  \nBut these connections were said to have enhanced Mtsweni\u2019s stature in the eyes of the Ndebele \nwho were his chief clientele.  \n \nMtsweni\u2019s own account of his connections with the chiefly family stressed the general \nappropriateness of chiefly rule over land, as well as emphasising \u2013 counter-intuitively \u2013 its \ncapacity to transcend ethnic discrimination: \nIf land is ruled by ordinary people it will not work. It should be under government or \nunder a chief. \u2026 It should be the chief who rules here. \u2026 I have strong connections with \nhim. This place should be under either a chief or government because committees are \ncorrupt. \n \nIf Doornkop\u2019s restored Pedi titleholders had been predisposed against their \u2018collaborator\u2019 chief, \nthe present-day willingness of the chief to endorse the taking-in of tenants made their antipathy \nstill stronger. Their dislike extended to Mtsweni, whom they likened derisively to an \nauthoritarian leader surrounded by his servile and uncritical followers. All newcomers to the \nfarm, one woman told me, would be heard to ask \u2018 \u201cwhere is King Mtsweni?\u201d Most of them \nthink that Mtsweni is responsible for this place.\u2019 Discourses of chiefship, in his case, served to \nobscure what might otherwise have appeared as naked greed. But chiefship was not simply an \nidiom drawn upon to give him greater authority and hence to lend him credibility as dispenser \nof land. The disguise and the true identity were hard to distinguish, since at least some of his \nproceeds were given directly to the chiefly family. Both Mtsweni, with his new \u2018following\u2019 of \n 13 \ndisplaced farm labourers, and the discredited chief who was attempting a revival of leadership \nfrom amongst the rural underclass, were endeavouring to build a basis for legitimacy.  \n \nThe broader context \u2013 with the chiefship undergoing a revival in South Africa (and Africa) in \ngeneral - undoubtedly played a major role here (Oomen 2005; Koelble and Li Puma 2005). But \nthe local appeal of the idea that chiefs could serve their people better than committees (as one \nman put it \u2018I would rather be ruled by one lion than a hundred rats\u2019) gave this national \nphenomenon some local purchase. Clientelist ties to chiefs was one among a series of parallel \nroutes by which a member of the Ndebele tenantry could secure a place to live, a livelihood, and \nsome political favour.7  \n \nTitleholders\u2019 views of Mtsweni\u2019s followers\u2019 loyalty to the chiefship may, however, have been \nbiased and partial. At least some of his clientele viewed his land dealing more as a commercial \ntransaction than in terms of the fealties involved in allegiance to a chief. While his unauthorised \nland-selling had led to charges of fraud being laid against Mtsweni in the Middelburg police \nstation by his fellow-title-holders in the Doornkop CPA Committeee, he now had more to fear \nfrom his customer\/clients than from his co-owners or from the authorities. Once his practice had \nbeen exposed as illegal, they felt they were entitled to a refund of the money they had paid him.  \nBut the rumour was spreading that he had spent the money. His clients, many of whom who had \nborrowed at excessive rates of interest to pay him in the first place and were still making \nrepayments, claimed that if he was unable to pay them back they would \u2018have to kill him\u2019. \n \nDespite his bravado, and his impassioned defence of landless people\u2019s rights and their right not \nto be oppressed, Mtsweni seemed to be running scared. At the height of the squatter invasion, \nwhen he was receiving amounts which started at around R150 (about \u00a31.50) but later peaked at \nR1,300 (\u00a3130), he was benefiting considerably from his following, not only because of their \npayments for land but also from their presence as a captive commercial clientele. According to \nsquatter leader Jan Masina, \u2018he had a big shop when the squatters were still flooding in\u2019. As a \nresult of title-holder antipathy to his land-selling practices, and various vigilante tactics used by \nsome of them to discourage the tenants from settling, the influx had since reduced to a trickle, \nand his shop was \u2018going downhill\u2019. Being worried about the accusations levelled and the \ncharges laid against him, he had become more circumspect about his land-selling practices, as \nthree of his fellow titleholders told me:  \nHe will refuse to sign the receipt, claiming that there is something wrong with his eyes. He \ngets it signed by someone else \u2013 a relative. Some squatters pay in instalments. Mtsweni \ngives a receipt for the first amount, but avoids giving them one for the second or for any \nsubsequent instalments. Or he just uses an exercise book. After two weeks, he says \u2018give \nme the slip, I need to fix it\u2019. Then he never gives it back.  \n \nWhat would finally spell the end of this attempt at brokering land deals was the intervention of \nthe state. Doornkop\u2019s squatter problem could not be allowed to continue; this invasion violated \nthe sanctity of property, as Mr Mohlala\u2019s statement makes clear. Local officials from the \nDepartment of Land Affairs had, for some time, been designing a \u2018solution\u2019 to this \u2018problem\u2019. \nBut this had already yielded grounds for the further development of brokerage - in which \naspirations for land access were combining with the recruitment of a potential political \nfollowing; and which paralleled, even if it did not directly connect with, the rise of Ndebele \npolitical power and influence in the region overall.  \n \n 14 \nAmos Mathibela, the bureaucratic squatter \nThe Department of Land Affairs bought a farm next to Doornkop to serve as the squatters\u2019 new \nhome. Plans were made to have the farm managed, and run along \u2018business\u2019 lines, by a \ncommittee elected from the squatter community: the Siyathuthuka Trust.8 Here was an \nopportunity to put into practice the redistributive aspect of land reform. But it soon became \nclear that there was a need for communication between state officials and the proposed \n\u2018beneficiaries\u2019 of the project. A spokesman \u2013 Amos Mathibela - emerged from among the \nsquatters. His followers voted him in as chair of the new Trust.  \n \nAmos combined the role of informal leader with that of intermediary and translator for the \ngovernment\u2019s consultant who had been charged with researching beneficiary needs and \narranging for the development of the new farm.  He had the flair of an aspirant leader as well as \noccupying a marginal and indeterminate status. His charisma was evident in the fact that, \ndespite only recently having finished school, he had since his early teens been acting as a self-\nstyled \u2018social worker\u2019 helping to resolve conflicts between local families in the Ndebele \ncommunity, as well as having developed a keen awareness of political and social matters \nthrough his attendance at Middelburg\u2019s town council meetings. He had also become the \nhelpmate and second-in-command to a local Ndebele notable, JB Mahlangu, who was an office-\nholder in the office of the provincial premier.  \n \n \nFigure 6: Amos Mathibela in front of his parents\u2019 house (photo Deborah James) \n \nIt was the need to solve Doornkop\u2019s \u2018squatter problem\u2019 that had drawn Amos into negotiations. \nHis role in arranging meetings, and in translating and facilitating the ubiquitous \u2018workshops\u2019 \nbeloved of those in the development field, had won him the trust of the white consultant running \nthe project for the local Department of Land Affairs and part-time employment in the service of \nthis consultant. His knowledge about the bureaucratic requirements of the state\u2019s land reform \nprogramme were considerable:  \nI was helping former settlers on Doornkop to obtain an alternative piece of land. \n 15 \nAfter the informal settlers at Doornkop heard about my work, they came to me and asked \nme to help them. Nobody was there to help them so I became involved with them early \nthis year. \u2026 \n \nThe squatters have to be moved from Doornkop, but they do not want to move, as they do \nnot understand what is happening. They are not educated, they do not know the law. This is \nwhy they need to be workshopped.  \n \nBut the workshops were delayed: due to have been held in December of 2002, they were \ncancelled because of Christmas celebrations. There were also delays in buying the new farm, \ndrafting a \u2018business plan\u2019, and putting the land into the hands of the squatter \u2018Trust\u2019, \nSiyathuthuka. During these delays, the attitudes of some squatters \u2013 particularly those who felt \nstrongly about the money they had paid to Mtsweni - hardened. They decided they did not want \nto move. Amos' attitude to them was quite uncompromising however: they should be evicted. \nHe blamed their intransigence on the fact that they were ignorant, and advocated a tough law-\nand-order style approach  \nNo one there knows what is wrong and what is right: this is because no one has taken a \nfirm stand on matters of law. \n \nBut this uncompromising response to the \u2018squatter problem\u2019 sounds puzzling if we bear in mind \nthat Amos was, at least by some definitions, one of their number. Indeed, he had been elected, \nby a majority of them, as the chairman of the Trust to which the new farm would belong. \nAlthough his position as Trust chairman implied his self-identification with this social category, \nthe reality was more complex. He had bought a stand from Mtsweni like the other squatters, but \nwas using his shack there as a shop rather than a dwelling-place, meanwhile residing with his \nparents in their brick-built house on a nearby smallholding where they were employed by a \nwhite Afrikaans plot-holder. (In this sense he differed from others in the regional tenantry. \nNeither he nor his family had \u2013 yet - been evicted and left homeless). \n \nAmos was now feeling the negative effects on his credibility of the state\u2019s failure to deliver on \nits promise to house the squatters on their new land. Squatter mistrust of their chairman was \nbased on state delays in buying and providing houses on their new farm, and these in turn were \nlinked to a wider rethinking of the redistribution programme and its eventual abandonment. \nMistrust was also based on a close scrutiny of the reputations of family members. Amos\u2019 father \nHendrik had already tried to position himself as a leading beneficiary of land reform in a \ndifferent, more grass-roots and less state-led, redistribution land purchase. But Hendrik had so \nfar been disappointed, was criticized for a similar inability to make progress and had been taken \nas an exemplar of the family\u2019s broader failure to deliver to its clients.  \n \nHere, a point made by Scott, writing about clientelist ties in Malaysia, is useful: patron and \nclient, he notes, are connected by multiplex (and hence flexible) ties (1972). Amos was not just \na member of the regional Ndebele tenantry. Although for some purposes he was just that \u2013 a \nmember of the landless eager to take up leadership of a land redistribution project - he had also \nembraced the bureaucratic language of the government, its commitment to a rational solution \ncentred on the purchase and legal ownership of private property via the \u2018willing buyer, willing \nseller\u2019 model. In a sense, he was the most immediate and available representative of state policy \nto be found in the local setting, and of its embrace of market-driven land acquisition.  \n \nIt was the fact that he had found a position working as translator\/mediator for the government \nwhich had given him a unique insight into - and indeed a genuine positionality, combined with a \n 16 \nflexible identity vis-\u00e0-vis - its mode of operation. In the new democratic dispensation, there was \na commitment to show the electorate that their demands were being taken seriously and, as far \nas possible, that the necessary services were being provided. The \u2018participatory workshops\u2019 \nbeloved of the NGO sector had now become an intrinsic part of the way the state operated at \nlocal level. It was not difficult to imagine a time in the near future when Amos, based on his \nproven skills at \u2018workshopping\u2019, would hold down a full-time government job. In the meantime, \nhe had begun to investigate the possibility of studying law, so the chances of his becoming an \neven better-paid professional before that date looked promising. \n \nYet Amos also had the flexibility to withdraw from too precise an identification with the state \nand with its market-driven ideology, as had begun to happen when the process was shown not to \nbe working. Both Amos and his father Hendrik were aiming to access land; not simply for the \nsake of \u2018farming\u2019 (the official government line), but equally for the sake of recruiting a political \nfollowing. Here there was a peculiar circularity. Both needed people, in the eyes of the state and \nits programme, to legitimate their respective bids to acquire land (see Wotshela 2001). That is, \nboth needed people in order to \u2018prove\u2019 to this overly bureaucratic regime with its commitment \nto egalitarianism, but its contradictory kowtowing to the demands of the market in the last \ninstance, that they had enough people on board to merit a \u2018redistribution project\u2019. Redistribution \nat this point still involved landless people receiving government \u2018settlement grants\u2019 and pooling \nthese to enable farm purchase.  Once the two men, father and son, were successful in acquiring \nland, they could then consolidate their command of people. But they needed the people to get \nthe land. Hendrik, the father, had already failed to do so. His failure was because of the zeal of \nstate planners policing the system: they decided that the price for which the white farmer \nwanted to sell the land was excessive. In this sense, the demands of the market \u2013 and hence the \npossibilities for unbridled brokerage - were being curbed in the interests of fairness. But it was \nmore likely that Amos, the son, would succeed. He, unlike his father who admitted his complete \nbafflement in the face of the particular demands embodied in the land reform programme and \nthe \u2018workshopping\u2019 that accompanied it, had successfully mastered both the language and the \nattendant practices of both \u2018state\u2019 and \u2018market\u2019, as well as having a firm-footed knowledge of \nthe Ndebele tenantry with its contradictory love of grassroots democracy delivered through the \nprotective embrace of an authoritarian chiefship. He combined these divergent attributes rather \nthan merely \u2018mediating\u2019 between them. His very persona was, in the words of Latour (2000), a \nzone or site of \u2018translation\u2019.   \n \nBrokers compared \nA close examination of these two figures reveals some important differences. The former, \nMtsweni, was a member of the titleholder group who ought by rights to have been more \u2018middle \nclass\u2019 in status, but neither his origins nor his restored land had assured him a position on the \nladder of upward mobility. The division between title-holders and tenants was not inexorable, and \ntitle-holding African communities had long been split between blue-collar labour migrants and \neducated teachers or members of the civil service, with many finer gradations of status and wealth \nbetween the two. It was from amongst the ranks of the poorer ones, with fewest alternatives for \nrural or urban livelihoods, that Mtsweni had emerged. Closer socio-economically to his clients than \nto his own counterparts, he was also most likely to come into conflict with these clients. His \nattempts at \u2018land selling\u2019 and his self-styled chiefly persona were in clear defiance of the rules \ngoverning communal property, which laid down strict rules for restituted properties, stipulating \nthat they be governed in line with principles of participatory democracy \u2013 that is, \u2018by \ncommittee\u2019. In the process of this defiance, he exposed his dependents to multiple uncertainties, \ngiven that the land was not, in fact, strictly his to let or sell.  \n \n 17 \nThe latter, Amos Mathibela, belonged \u2013 albeit ambiguously - to a much lower status ethnic\/class \ngroup. Although its members had benefited from opportunities for some forms of \nentrepreneurial activity in the past (building, taxi driving, etc.), they had not, before 1994, had \naccess to political power, but this had newly become possible. Amos himself had no political \nambitions \u2013 yet \u2013 but his patron-mentor, JB Mahlangu, was likely later to help him advance. \nAmos\u2019s actions, while respectful of the redistributive and egalitarian spirit of the new \nconstitution, were also mindful of the sacrosanct nature of property: both that which the \nsquatters were currently illicitly occupying (for which reason he insisted - even though he was \none of them - they ought by rights to relocate) and that which, under his leadership, they might \nlater secure, in line with a state-approved trajectory of legitimately redistributed ownership \nsubjected to a valid \u2018business plan\u2019.  \n \nWhere one of these figures seemed to have an intuitive understanding of the aspirations of \u2018the \npeople\u2019, the other seemed more attuned to the mode of operation of \u2018the state\u2019, including its \nforegrounding of \u2018market\u2019 principles. Where one was deploying a home-grown solution \ndrawing on the appeal of traditional authority, the other operated according to rationalized and \nbureaucratic practices and principles. In both cases, both the initial trust placed in these figures \nto deliver land to their followers, and the later disillusionment, showed that straightforward, \nunmediated access to the rights of the citizen were proving elusive. Those in the lower income \ndeciles \u2013 such as these displaced members of the tenantry - were indeed failing to represent \nthemselves politically or to unite in defence of such rights (Seekings and Nattrass 2005). \nInstead, they were attaching themselves to entrepreneur\/brokers who embodied a complex \nmixture of styles: combining earlier models of political and economic dependency with newer \nvisions of autonomous self-sufficiency which promised to help them succeed in becoming the \n\u2018buyers\u2019 of land. \n \nIn South Africa, where rates of inequality have increased since the advent of democracy, it is \nincreasingly unlikely that inequities of ownership will be effectively redressed through \nimpersonal mechanisms of redistributive justice. People\u2019s resorting to dependence on \nintermediary figures to deliver alternative, informal modes of land access must be understood in \nlight of this fact. But there are \u2018limits to negotiability\u2019 in such land-holding (Peters 2002). \nDisputes, of the kind that erupted in the wake of Mtsweni\u2019s land selling or that threatened to \ndisrupt Amos\u2019s plans by making his followers begin to distrust him, have been left to be self-\nsolved by the newly-titled owner\/members of Communal Property Associations. The state, despite \nits hands-on and overly directive involvement in the transitional planning of land reform, has been \nreluctant to intervene in the affairs of these property-holding bodies once land has been \ntransferred.9 This may leave governance, here as elsewhere in South Africa, to be mediated by \nethnic frameworks and the rule of chiefs, real or self-styled. Another possibility, hinted at here \nby the CPA membership's legal action against Mtsweni and by Amos's appeal to the law, is that \nrecourse to civil law will be the medium in which governance and politics are played out (J and \nJL Comaroff  2006).10 \n \nIn such a setting, allegiance to chiefs, other big men, or brokers provides the basis for some \npolitical and economic gain. The gains are marginal (the land is unproductive, the spoils are \nscarcely worth the taking), but the promise of accelerated social mobility, if not its realization, \nis a vivid one. Although people like Amos Mathibela with his entrepreneurial and leadership \nskills are outnumbered by the multitude of their real or prospective followers with fewer \nprospects of upward mobility, the promise was there: one to be realized (or thought to be \nachieved) via connections to chiefs or to a range of elites or proto-elites in this fluid setting. The \n 18 \nforms of representation which Seekings and Nattrass say are lacking for \u2018the underclass\u2019 (ibid.) \nthus do exist, but are structured by a revived clientelism which, in some cases, bears traces of \nethnic identification.  \n \nBrokering thus enables a synthesis between divergent and apparently irreconcilable positions.  \nA complex interaction exists between three key modes of identification: the hierarchy and \npromise of relative security offered by chiefly patronage; the egalitarianism and \nredistributiveness of \u2018rights talk\u2019 and of the new democratic order; and the \u2018choice\u2019 of the \nmarket underpinned by individualism. The latter encompassed both the promise of re-securing \nthe ownership of previously-owned property (the spirit of restitution) and the opportunity of \ngaining access to new property for those who had never held it (the spirit of redistribution). \nSeemingly contradictory impulses were merging and being \u2018translated\u2019 into one another. New \nforms of identification were emerging, which in turn promised to materialize into prospects \u2013 \nhowever elusive and remote - for socio-economic advancement.  \n \nConclusion \nThe co-existence of apparently unlike moral qualities has been a matter of some puzzlement to \npolitical anthropologists: how can centralized authority and hierarchy on the one hand be \nreconciled with consensual, egalitarian or choice-based frameworks on the other? Some \nportrayals allowed for the coexistence of both within an overarching frame. In Leach\u2019s analysis \n(1954), the variation in political styles was generated by individuals\u2019 power-hungry \nopportunism on the one hand, constrained and challenged by the structurally shaped \nexpectations of their followers\/in-laws on the other. As anthropologists increasingly concerned \nthemselves with the inequalities brought by colonial and capitalist forces, choice and consensus \nwere dismissed as ideological constructs masking the true sources of inequality (Asad 1972). \nAn emphasis on the structural determinants of power, and an accompanying antipathy to \nmethodological individualism, became the dominant tendency in Marxist frameworks of the \n1970s. This led to the virtual disappearance in anthropology of the broker, with his opportunism \nand morally offensive proclivity to take advantage of vertical hierarchical divisions rather than \norganising politically in the interests of group action (Alavi 1973), but other scholars have been \nless judgemental about the moral ambiguities and contradictions involved. I argue that it is \nprecisely these contradictions which should lead us to acknowledge and reconsider the re-\nemergence of this picaresque figure. \n \nI have here reconsidered the role of the broker, not simply as a figure who stands between \npowerless people and the externally imposed power of the modern state or the irresistible force \nof the market, but \u2013 partly opportunistically and partly in response to his constituents\u2019 demands \n- as one who activates the continuing interplay between apparently irreconcilable discourses and \npractices. My argument draws on studies of popular culture, where brokerage was celebrated for \nits creativity and inventiveness (Barber 1987), and those of scholars in development studies, \nwhich celebrate its capacity to translate across divergent frameworks (Mosse and Lewis 2006). \n \nAm I, then, simply reverting to the argument of the methodological individualists, by pointing \nto the broker\u2019s choice, creative skill, or ability to manipulate situations to his own ends, \nirrespective of structural constraints? If so, does this represent a repudiation of the claim that \nbrokers merely operate in a narrow band of flexibility - given that late capitalism has brought a \nnew and distinctive political order into being, with its modern and apparently immutable forms \nof statecraft (Mitchell 1990)?) In either case, are both brokers and followers - who try to \n 19 \nreanimate ideas of \u2018moral economy\u2019 by appealing to and reconstructing personalized \nrelationships - failing accurately to perceive the fixity of \u2018state effects\u2019 (Mitchell 1999) and\/or \nfailing to acknowledge the power of the market which increasingly underpins or is merged with \nsuch effects (Ferguson and Gupta 2002), or are they attempting genuinely to counter this by \nreconfiguring society in line with an earlier social order (Scott 1976)?  \n \nI prefer not to side with one side or other in this long-standing debate. Instead, under the \npeculiar conditions which merge aspects of classic \u2018neoliberalism\u2019 with those of an \ninterventionist and welfarist state, while attempting to force individuals to take responsibility for \ntheir own wellbeing (see Rajak 2008), I argue that brokers are both product and producers of a \nnew kind of society. They re-emerge in a setting where the state intervenes, partly to create \nconditions where the market will have primacy (Ferguson and Gupta 2002) but also to \nameliorate the resulting inequities through redistributive practices (Seekings and Nattrass 2005). \nThe return of the broker is partly, but not only, a response to these conditions. It serves to create \nand perpetuate such conditions, and indeed embodies the contradictions which ensue.  \n \nBibliography \nAdams, M. 2002.

According to the Surplus Peoples Project, \n600,000 were moved from \u2018black spots\u2019 and 2 million from white farmland, but these figures \ndisguise the occurrence of resettlements which were apparently more \u2018voluntary\u2019 in nature yet \nnonetheless involved duress. Around 3.5 million were relocated from white South Africa to \nthese \u2018homelands\u2019 between 1960 and 1980 (Adams 2002).  \n2 The patterns discussed here did not apply equally in all provinces. About 70% of Limpopo \nProvince province was under claim at the time of publication. Such a scale makes resolving land \nissues almost impossible, since these affect relations between displaced tenants and black \ncommunities already residing on African land in the former homelands. This movement from \nwhite farms accelerated the impoverishment of the people already living on such land. Such \nconflicts are not considered in the present paper. \n3 The CPA (Communal Property Association) Bill was drafted and approved by Parliament in \n1995, and the CPA Act passed in 1996. It stipulates that each CPA must have a constitution, a \nsystem of governance such that individual members elect a committee, a means of transferring \nproperty upon the death of individual members, and the like. Activists point to the resulting lack \nof clarity on the nature of rights and responsibilities, on how disputes between communal \nowners are to be resolved, and on exactly who is entitled to make decisions about land use \n(James 2007:154-76). \n 23 \n                                                                                                                                 \n4  The policy of tenure reform has given rise to much debate. It affected the land-allocating \npowers of chiefs, with whose powers the ANC became increasingly reluctant to interfere. As a \nresult, legislation was much delayed. When it was eventually passed, CLaRA (the Communal \nLand Rights Act) was challenged in the constitutional court. Delays created even greater \nuncertainty for communal area residents, thus potentially increasing the power of brokers. \nTenure reform is not discussed here since it does not concern the current paper.   \n5 Some names have been changed.  \n6 See footnote 4. \n \n7 For the link between local elaborations of the chiefship and its national resurgence, see \nMcNeill (2007:43-82); James (2007:202-5.) \n8 In restitution cases initiated early in the 1990s, the CPA, as an embodiment of the strong \ncommunal ethic involved in \u2018getting land back\u2019, was preferred and advocated by state and NGO \nofficers alike, but when it was realised that CPA ownership often led to a paralysis of decision-\nmaking, a Trust-style legal entity was preferred on the grounds that it would facilitate decisive \naction.  \n9 The government\u2019s failure to protect the rights of such property-owners may in part be \nexplained by its unwillingness to be seen as an evicter of squatters and therefore as having \nsimilarities to the apartheid regime: particularly if doing so would alienate the political support \nof the landless (mostly Ndebele-speaking) majority.  \n10 Something of this kind occurred in other land reform cases in SA, particularly in the court \nchallenge to the Communal Land Rights Act of 2004 brought by several communities which \nhad received land under land reform. \n"}
