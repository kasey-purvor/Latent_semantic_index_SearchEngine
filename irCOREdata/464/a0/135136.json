INTRODUCTION\nReinforced-concrete deep beams such as transfer girders, pile\ncaps and foundation walls in tall buildings commonly have\nseveral supports. The coexistence of high shear and high\nmoment within interior shear spans in continuous deep beams\nhas a considerable effect on the development of cracks, leading\nto a significant reduction in the effective strength of the\nconcrete strut joining the load and support points, which is the\nmain load transfer element in deep beams. A few test results1\u20133\nalso showed that shear capacity within interior shear spans in\ncontinuous deep beams generally decreased compared with that\nof simply supported deep beams.\nOpenings are frequently placed in the web area of reinforced-\nconcrete deep beams in order to facilitate essential services,\nsuch as conduits, water supply and drainage pipes, network\nsystem access or even movement from one room to another.\nThese openings often interrupt the load transfer by concrete\nstruts and can cause a sharp decrease of strength and\nserviceability of deep beams.4\u20136 Many diagonal cracks can also\nbe developed above and below openings in reinforced-concrete\ndeep beams owing to high stress concentration at corners and\nStructures & Buildings 160 Issue SB3 Inclined reinforcement around web opening in concrete beams Yang \u2022 Ashour 173\nthe abrupt change of the main load path. In addition, the\nexperimental investigation carried out by Ashour and Rishi7\nshowed that the structural behaviour of continuous deep beams\nsuch as failure mode, load transfer mechanism and load\ncapacity was significantly dependent on size and location of\nweb openings and different from that of simply supported deep\nbeams.\nProper arrangement of web reinforcement around openings\nenables diagonal cracks to be controlled above and below\nopenings and enhances the load capacity of deep beams. From\nthe few test results5,8,9 of simple deep beams, it was concluded\nthat inclined reinforcement around openings is more effective\nin improving the ultimate shear strength of deep beams with\nopenings than horizontal or vertical reinforcement. Very few, if\nany, available data on the effect of inclined reinforcement\naround openings on the structural behaviour of continuous\ndeep beams were, however, published. Furthermore, their\ndesign guidelines have not been provided yet by most code\nprovisions.10\u201313 A reasonable evaluation of the influence of\nweb openings and inclined reinforcement on structural\nbehaviour of continuous deep beams therefore requires further\ninvestigation.\nThe objective of the present study is to evaluate the effect of\nthe opening size and amount of inclined reinforcement around\nopenings on controlling diagonal cracks and load capacity of\ncontinuous deep beams. Twelve reinforced-concrete continuous\ndeep beams with web openings were tested to failure. Four\nsizes of web openings and three values of inclined\nreinforcement were investigated. The structural behaviour of\nbeams tested is analysed against the effective inclined\nreinforcement factor proposed by Yang et al.9 and compared\nwith that of a companion solid deep beam14 having the same\ngeometrical dimension and longitudinal top and bottom\nreinforcements. The measured load capacity is also compared\nwith the prediction obtained from a numerical technique based\non upper-bound analysis of the plasticity theory.\n2. RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCE\nWeb openings within interior shear spans of continuous deep\nbeams cause a significant reduction of load capacity and\nreinforcement details around web openings are an essential\nconsideration for safe design of such members. Available data\non tests of continuous deep beams with web reinforcement\naround web openings are, however, scarce. The present study\nshows that the structural behaviour of continuous deep beams\nhaving openings within interior shear spans is significantly\ninfluenced by an effective inclined reinforcement factor. The\nload capacity of deep beams having openings within interior\nshear spans is reasonably predicted using a numerical\ntechnique based on upper-bound analysis of the plasticity\ntheory.\n3. EFFECTIVE INCLINED REINFORCEMENT FACTOR\nPropagation of diagonal cracks above and below web\nopenings and load capacity of deep beams with openings\nwould be greatly influenced by reinforcement around\nopenings and the ratio of opening area to shear span area.\nYang et al.9 suggested an effective inclined reinforcement\nfactor \u0004 to account for the influence of opening size and\namount of reinforcement around openings on the structural\nbehaviour of deep beams as follows\n\u0004 \u00bc ntAd1 sin(\u0001t \u00fe \u0141t) \u00fe nbAd1 sin(\u0001b \u00fe \u0141b)\nm1m2bw\u00bdk2h= sin \u0141b \u00fe (1\u0002 k2 \u0002 m2)h= sin \u0141t\u0003\n1\nwhere subscripts t and b indicate the top and bottom chords\nabove and below openings, respectively; n and Ad1 are the\nnumber and area of inclined reinforcement around openings,\nrespectively; \u0001 is the angle between inclined reinforcement and\nthe longitudinal axis of the beam; \u0141 is the angle of the failure\nplane to the longitudinal axis of the beam; h is overall section\ndepth; m1 is the ratio of opening width to shear span; m2 is\nthe ratio of opening depth to overall section depth; k2 is the\nratio of distance between soffit of the beam and bottom face of\nopening to overall section depth as shown in Fig. 1.\n4. EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION\n4.1. Test specimens\nDetails of geometrical dimensions and reinforcement of test\nspecimens are given in Table 1 and Fig. 1. Beams tested were\nclassified into two groups according to the opening width:\nT-series and F-series for opening widths of 0:25a and 0:5a,\nrespectively, where a is the shear span. Three opening depths\nwere studied: 0:1h, 0:2h and 0:3h. As a result, the ratio of the\nopening area to shear span area rOA \u00bc m1 3 m2 were 0.025,\n0.075, 0.1 and 0.15 as given in Table 1. Inclined web\nreinforcement was arranged in layers above and below\nopenings, each consisting of two deformed bars of 10 mm\ndiameter of net area 71 mm2. The angle of all inclined\nreinforcement was chosen to be 458 to the longitudinal axis of\nthe beams tested and placed\nsymmetrically at the top\nchord above openings and\nbottom chord below openings\nas shown in Fig. 1. The\neffective inclined\nreinforcement factor \u0004, as\nestimated from equation (1),\nranged between 0.0 and\n0.171 as given in Table 1.\nThe beam notation given in\nTable 1 includes three parts.\nThe first letter gives the\nopening width: T for 0:25a\nand F for 0:5a.

Specimen details and arrangement of reinforcement (all dimensions in mm)\n174 Structures & Buildings 160 Issue SB3 Inclined reinforcement around web opening in concrete beams Yang \u2022 Ashour\nnumber 1, 2 or 3 refers to an opening depth of 0.1h, 0.2h or\n0.3h, respectively. The third part is used to identify the number\nof inclined reinforcements around openings. For example, T1\u2013\n2 is a continuous deep beam having an opening size of\n0:25a3 0:1h and two inclined reinforcements (2\u000510) placed\nabove and below openings.\nAll tested beams had the same section size of 160 3 600 mm,\nshear span-to-overall depth ratio a=h of 1.0, and web\nopenings within interior shear spans as shown in Fig. 1. As\nopenings within interior shear spans have a more significant\neffect on the behaviour of continuous deep beams than those\nwithin exterior shear spans,7,14 openings were located within\ninterior shear spans of the beams tested. The opening centre\nwas also positioned in accordance with that of the interior\nshear span area so that the opening completely interrupts the\nnatural load path joining the load and intermediate support\nplates.\nThree deformed steel bars of 19 mm diameter having\n287 mm2 net area were used for each longitudinal top and\nbottom reinforcement. As a result, both the longitudinal top\nr9s(\u00bc A9s=bwd) and bottom rs(\u00bc As=bwd) reinforcement ratios\nwere the same in all beams tested at 0.0097, where A9s and\nAs are the areas of longitudinal top and bottom\nreinforcement, respectively, bw is the section width, and d is\nthe effective section depth. Rogowsky et al.1 and Ashour3\nshowed that the difference\nbetween the amount of\nlongitudinal top and bottom\nreinforcement had little\ninfluence on the structural\nbehaviour of continuous deep\nbeams failed in shear owing to\ncrushing of diagonal concrete\nstruts joining the load and support points. The longitudinal\nbottom reinforcement was continuous over the full length of\nthe beam and welded to 160 3 100 3 10 mm end plates. The\nlongitudinal top reinforcement was anchored outside the end\nsupport by a 908 hook according to ACI 318\u201305.10 The clear\ncover to longitudinal top and bottom reinforcement was\n35 mm. Two horizontal deformed steel bars of 10 mm\ndiameter were placed immediately above openings to ease\nthe arrangement of inclined web reinforcement and transfer\ntensile forces by strut-and-tie action as suggested by\nTan et al.8\n4.2. Material properties\nThe design compressive strength of concrete was 55 MPa. The\ningredients of ready-mixed concrete used to cast test specimens\nwere ordinary Portland cement, fly-ash, irregular gravel of a\nmaximum size of 25 mm and sand with a maximum size of\n5 mm. The water\u2013binder ratio by mass was 31% and 25% of\nfly-ash to the mass of cement was added. Three control\ncylinders were cast and cured simultaneously with each beam\nto determine the concrete compressive strength, which was the\nsame in all beams at 50.52 MPa.\nBoth 19 mm and 10 mm diameter steel bars were tested in\ntension according to the Korean Industrial Standard.15 Table 2\nshows the mechanical properties of all reinforcement used in\nthe beams tested.\nSpecimen Details of opening Inclined reinforcement\nWidth Depth rOA No. and\ndiameter*\n\u0004\nm1 m1a:\nmm\nm2 m2h:\nmm\nT1\u20130 0.25 150 0.1 60 0.025 None 0.000\nT1\u20132 2\u000510 0.086\nT1\u20134 4\u000510 0.171\nT3\u20130 0.3 180 0.075 None 0.000\nT3\u20136 6\u000510 0.104\nF2\u20130 0.5 300 0.2 120 0.1 None 0.000\nF2\u20134 4\u000510 0.051\nF2\u20136 6\u000510 0.077\nF3\u20130 0.3 180 0.15 None 0.000\nF3\u20132 2\u000510 0.021\nF3\u20134 4\u000510 0.041\nF3\u20136 6\u000510 0.062\nNote: m1 is ratio of opening width to shear span; m2 is ratio of opening depth to overall section\ndepth; rOA is ratio of opening area to shear span area; and \u0004 is effective inclined reinforcement\nfactor given by equation (1).\n* The same inclined reinforcement in top and bottom chords above and below openings.\nAll tested beams had the same concrete compressive strength of 50.5 MPa, shear span-to-overall\ndepth ratio of 1.0, and web openings within interior shear spans.\nTable 1.

Instrumentation and test set-up\nFigure 2 shows the loading and instrumentation arrangement\nof beams tested. All beams having two spans were tested to\nfailure under a symmetrical two-point top loading system\nwith a loading rate of 30 kN\/min using a 3000 kN load\ncapacity universal testing machine (UTM). Each span was\nidentified as W-span or E-span as shown in Figs 1 and 2. The\ntwo exterior end supports are designed to allow horizontal\nand rotational movements whereas the intermediate support\nprevents horizontal movement but allows rotation. In order to\nevaluate the shear force and loading distribution, 1000 kN\ncapacity load cells were installed at both exterior end\nsupports.\nVertical deflections at beam mid-spans were measured using\nlinear variable differential transformers (LVDTs). The PI-type\ngauges were used for monitoring diagonal crack width at\nconcrete struts joining the edges of load or intermediate\nsupport plates and opening corners as shown in Fig. 2. The\nbeam surface was whitewashed to aid the observation of crack\ndevelopment during testing. After each load increment, the\nload was kept constant while cracks were marked and\nphotographed. The test data were captured by a data logger\nand automatically stored.\n5. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n5.1. Crack propagation and failure mode\nFigure 3 shows the crack propagation and failure planes of\ntested beams having openings; the total load (in kN) at which\ncracks occurred is also given in this figure. Just before failure,\na very similar crack pattern was observed above and below\nopenings and for both W and E spans of the beams tested. The\nfirst crack in all beam specimens occurred at opening corners\nnear load points (at B and D in Fig. 2) and propagated towards\nthe load points with the load increase. This first diagonal crack\nload at opening corners decreased with the increase of the\nwidth and depth of openings but was not influenced by the\namount of inclined reinforcement, as given in Table 3. Bottom\nflexural cracks at the beam mid-span and top flexural cracks\nover the intermediate support followed and then diagonal\ncracks originated at opening corners opposite to the load points\n(at A and C in Fig. 2). Most cracks concentrated at corners of\nopenings and diagonal cracks at exterior shear spans did not\nappear as shown in Fig. 3.\nThe amount of inclined reinforcement influenced the\ndistribution of cracks above and below openings. Beams T1\u20130,\nT3\u20130, F2\u20130 and F3\u20130 without inclined reinforcement failed\nsoon after the occurrence of diagonal cracks joining the edges\nof load or intermediate support plates and opening corners\nopposite to their plates. On the other hand, for beams tested\nwith inclined reinforcement, several diagonal cracks developed\nforming a fan-shaped distribution at both top and bottom\nchords above and below openings. Even F-series beams having\na large opening width showed good distribution of diagonal\ncracks when the effective inclined reinforcement factor was\nabove 0.051, as shown in Fig. 3(g), (h), (k) and (l).\nFailure planes of all tested beams having openings were formed\nasymmetrically along diagonal cracks joining the edges of the\nload and support plates and opening corners opposite to the\nload and reaction points, AE and CF, as shown in Fig. 3. These\nfailure planes followed the upper and lower force paths of\nsimple deep beams with openings proposed by Kong et al.,5\nregardless of the effectiveness inclined reinforcement factor.\nThe displacements of blocks formed in continuous deep beams\nwere, however, different from those of simple deep beams. For\ncontinuous deep beams having openings within interior shear\nspans, the end block in failed span had rotational displacement\nabout one end support while the other block was fixed over the\nintermediate and other end supports, whereas the two blocks\nformed in simple deep beams with web openings had rotational\ndisplacement around end supports.\n5.2. Load plotted against mid-span deflection\nMid-span deflections at failed span for different beams tested\nagainst the total applied load are shown in Fig. 4. On the\nsame figure, mid-span deflection of a companion solid deep\nbeam14 is also reproduced. The initial stiffness of beams until\nthe occurrence of the first diagonal crack at opening corners\nwas almost independent on the opening size and amount of\ninclined reinforcement. After the first diagonal crack\nappeared, a smaller deflection was observed in beams with\nsmaller openings and higher amount of inclined\nreinforcement. The stiffness after the first diagonal crack of\nbeam T1\u20134 having \u0004 \u00bc 0.171 was closer to that of the\ncompanion solid deep beam.\nPost-failure characteristics of\nbeams tested were also\ninfluenced by the effective\ninclined reinforcement factor.\nThe beams having \u0004 . 0.051\nshowed some ductile\nbehaviour at failure despite\nthe tensile splitting of\nconcrete struts above and\nbelow openings owing to\ncompressive force.\n5.3.

The size of openings within interior\nshear spans and amount of inclined reinforcement had a\nsignificant influence on load distribution after the first\ndiagonal crack in continuous deep beams. The end support\nreaction of a companion solid deep beam and that obtained\nfrom a linear two-dimensional finite-element (2D FE) analysis\nare also presented in Fig. 5. The end support reaction of\nbeams having opening size of 0:25a3 0:1h was similar to\nthat of the companion solid deep beam regardless of the\namount of inclined reinforcement around openings. On the\nother hand, for T-series beams having opening size of\n0:25a3 0:3h and F-series beams, the larger the opening size\nand the smaller the amount of inclined reinforcement, the\nhigher the end support reaction, indicating that end support\nreaction is becoming closer to that of the solid deep beam\nwith the increase of the effective inclined reinforcement\nfactor.\n5.4. Diagonal crack width\nFigure 6 shows the development of diagonal crack width\nagainst the total applied load along the diagonal plane\njoining the edge of the intermediate support plate and\nopening corner opposite to the support (DF in Fig. 2). In\nFig. 6 the limit crack width of 0.4 mm specified for\nserviceability of concrete members in ACI 318\u20130216 is also\nplotted.

Load capacity\nThe influence of the effective inclined reinforcement factor \u0004on\nthe normalised load capacity \u00ban \u00bc Pn=2bwhf 9c, of the test\nspecimens is shown in Fig. 7 and Table 3, where Pn is the total\nload capacity, and f 9c is the concrete compressive strength. The\nload capacity of beams without inclined reinforcement\ndecreased with the increase of the size of openings within\ninterior shear spans. The load capacity of beams F2\u20130 and F3\u2013\n0 whose opening width was 0:5a decreased compared with that\nof the companion solid deep beam by 35% and 40%,\nrespectively. On the other hand, the inclined reinforcement\naround openings enabled beams tested to enhance their load\ncapacity as observed in simple deep beams.9 Beams tested\nhaving \u0004 . 0.077 (F2\u20136, T1\u20132, T3\u20136 and T1\u20134) exhibited\nhigher load capacity than that of the companion solid deep\nbeam.\n5.6. Structural functions of inclined reinforcement\naround openings\nAs shown from Figs 3\u20137, it can be concluded that the inclined\nreinforcement around openings in continuous deep beams has\ntwo main structural functions: to resist the transverse tensile\nforce developed in concrete struts above and below openings\nand improve the ductility of concrete struts owing to the\nconfinement effect. The tensile transfer capacity of inclined\nreinforcement enables the diagonal crack width to be\neffectively controlled, as pointed out by Vecchio and Collins17\nand provide load transfer mechanism by truss action as\nproposed by Tan et al.8 As a result, inclined reinforcement\naround openings can compensate for the reduced beam\nstiffness owing to diagonal cracks around openings, which is\nclearly shown by Figs 4 and 5. In addition, the enhanced\nductility of concrete struts helps to increase the effective\nconcrete strength, as suggested by many researchers2,3,7,8,17\nand code provisions.10,12\n6. MECHANISM ANALYSIS\nThe failure mode of reinforced-concrete continuous deep\nbeams having web openings within interior shear spans as\npresented in Fig. 3, which was observed in the current\ninvestigation and elsewhere,7,14 can be idealised as an\nassemblage of two rigid blocks separated by two yield lines as\nproposed by Ashour and Rishi.7 Rigid block I rotated about an\nIC and rigid block II was fixed over the intermediate and one\nend supports as shown in Fig. 8(a). Both upper and lower yield\nlines seldom have the same displacement rate and angle about\nIC, as they are formed discontinuously by the opening. By\nequating the total internal energy dissipated in concrete along\nthe hyperbolic yield lines and in steel reinforcement crossing\nthe yield lines to the external work done by the vertical applied\nload, the normalised load capacity, \u00ban \u00bc Pn=2bwhf 9c , can be\ndeveloped in the following form7,14\n\u00ban \u00bc 1\n2a\nX2\ni\u00bc1\n(ve)i ri(1\u0002 sin\u00c6i)li\u00bd \u0003\n\"\n\u00fe2\nXn\nj\u00bc1\n(\u0005s) j(rs) j cos(\u00c6s) j\n#2\nwhere (ve)i is the effectiveness factor of concrete at yield line i;\n\u00c6i is the angle between the relative displacement \u0001i at the\nmidpoint of the chord and yield line i; li is the length of the\nyield line i; ri is the distance between the midpoint of the\nchord of the yield line i and IC; n is the number of reinforcing\nbars crossing the yield line; (\u0005s) j \u00bc (Ast) j( fy) j=bwhf 9c is the\nreinforcement index for each individual reinforcing bar j\ncrossing the yield line (Ast) j; ( fy) j is the area and yield\nstrength of the reinforcing bar j crossing the yield line,\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n1200\n1400\n1600\n1800\nTo\nta\nl a\npp\nlie\nd \nlo\nad\n: k\nN\nT1 0\u2013\nT1 2\u2013\nT1 4\u2013\nT3 0\u2013\nT3 6\u2013\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n1200\n1400\nTo\nta\nl a\npp\nlie\nd \nlo\nad\n: k\nN\nF2 0\u2013 F2 4\u2013\nF2 6\u2013 F3 0\u2013\nF3 2\u2013 F3 4\u2013\nF3 6\u2013\nDiagonal crack width: mm\n(a)\nCrack width limit for serviceability\nspecified in ACI 318\u201302\n\u0002 0\u00b7171\u0001\n\u0002 0\u00b7104\u0001\n\u0002 0\u00b7086\u0001\n\u0002 0\u0001\n0 0\u00b72 0\u00b74 0\u00b76 0\u00b78 1 0\u00b7 1\u00b72 1\u00b74 1\u00b76 1\u00b78 2\u00b70\nDiagonal crack width: mm\n(b)\nCrack width limit for serviceability\nspecified in ACI 318\u201302\n\u0002 0\u00b7077\u0001\n\u0002 0\u00b7062\u0001\n\u0002 0\u00b7051\u0001\n\u0002 0\u0001\n0 0\u00b72 0\u00b74 0\u00b76 0\u00b78 1\u00b70 1\u00b72 1\u00b74 1\u00b76 1\u00b78\n\u0002 \u00020, 0\u00b7021\u0001 \u0001\n\u0002 0\u00b7041\u0001\nFig. 6.

Effectiveness factor of concrete\nIn developing the above equation, concrete is regarded as a\nrigid perfectly plastic material with an effective compressive\nstrength f\u0001c (\u00bc ve f 9c) and obeying the modified Coulomb failure\ncriteria with zero tension cut-off.18 The effectiveness factor of\nconcrete proposed by Vecchio and Collins17 is adopted in the\npresent study and also modified to consider the influence of\nsize effect as follows\n(ve)i \u00bc \u0002i\n1:0\u00fe (Kc)i K f\n(Kc)i \u00bc 0:35 \u0002 (\u00011)i\n(\u00013)i\n\u0002 0:28\n\u0003 \u00040:8\n> 1:0\nK f \u00bc 0:1825\n\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\nf 9c\np\n> 1:0\n\u0002i \u00bc 1\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\n1\u00fe (ds)i\n25da\nr\n3\nwhere (\u00011)i and (\u00013)i are the principal tensile and compressive\nstrains in the yield line i, respectively. As the principal strains\n(\u00011,3)i are 1=2\u00f0\u0006i=\u02dci)(sin\u00c6i \u0004 1) in the yield line i having\ndiscontinuous width of \u02dci from the plasticity theory,18\n(\u0002\u00071=\u00073)i in factor (Kc)i can be written as 1\u00fe sin\u00c6i=1\u0002 sin\u00c6i.\nThis indicates that the influence of the transverse tensile strain\non the effectiveness factor can be determined by the angle \u00c6i.\nThe factor \u0002i proposed by Baz\u02c7ant and Kim,19 which is a\nfunction of the depth (ds)i of yield line i and the maximum size\nda of aggregate, is to reflect the influence of the size effect\nwhich is significant in deep beams.\n6.2. Solution procedure\nThe load capacity of continuous deep beams having openings\nwithin interior shear spans is implicitly expressed as a function\nof the position of the instantaneous centre (X ic, Yic) as given in\nequation (2). As the vertical displacement at the end support\nbeneath rigid block I is prevented, the IC can be located along\nthe end support. The process of tuning the vertical coordinate\n(Yic) to obtain the minimum value of the load capacity is\nachieved by reliable numerical optimisation procedures\nprovided in MATLAB software.\n6.3. Comparisons of predicted and experimental failure\nloads\nTo examine the validity of the proposed model, comparisons\nbetween the predictions and experimental results of the\nnormalised load capacity are given in Table 3 and Fig. 9.

CONCLUSIONS\nTwelve reinforced-concrete continuous deep beams having web\nopenings within interior shear spans were tested to failure. The\nmain variables investigated were the opening size and amount\nof inclined reinforcement around openings. Test results are\nanalysed against an effective inclined reinforcement factor. In\naddition, the load capacity of beams tested is compared with\nprediction obtained from a numerical technique based on the\nupper-bound analysis of the plasticity theory. The following\nconclusions can be drawn.\n(a) Several diagonal cracks developed, forming a fan-shaped\ndistribution at both top and bottom chords above and\nbelow openings of beams having web-inclined\nreinforcement\u2014unlike the beams with no inclined web\nreinforcement. Even beams having opening width of half\nthe shear span showed good distribution of diagonal cracks\nwhen the effective inclined reinforcement factor was\n. 0:051.\n(b) The end support reaction of beams having an opening area\nratio of 0.025 was similar to that of the companion solid\ndeep beam regardless of the amount of inclined\nreinforcement. On the other hand, for beams having an\nopening area ratio . 0:075, the end support reactions\nbecame closer to those of the companion solid deep beam\nwith the increase of the effective inclined reinforcement\nfactor.\n(c) A sudden increase of diagonal crack width after the\noccurrence of the first diagonal crack hardly occurred in\nbeams having an effective inclined reinforcement factor\n. 0:041, and the increasing rate of the diagonal crack\nwidth against the total applied load decreased with the\nincrease of the effective inclined reinforcement factor.\n(d ) The load capacity of deep beams having openings within\ninterior shear spans increased with the increase of the\neffective inclined reinforcement factor. Beams having an\neffective inclined reinforcement factor . 0:077 exhibited a\nhigher load capacity than that of the companion solid deep\nbeam.\n(e) The mechanism analysis proposed to predict the load\ncapacity of continuous deep beams having web openings\nwithin interior shear spans showed good agreement with\nexperimental results.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis work was supported by the Korea Research Foundation\nGrant (KRF-2004\u2013041-D00746) and the Regional Research\nCenters Program (Bio-housing Research Institute), granted by\nthe Korean Ministry of Education and Human Resources\nDevelopment.
