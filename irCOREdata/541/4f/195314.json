Doi: 10.1016\/S1364-6826(96)00031-4Metadata only entryFour high frequency propagation paths were monitored from a transmitter located within the polar cap by four receivers located variously within the polar cap and at sub-auroral latitudes. Of these paths, one was contained entirely within the polar cap at all times, two were trans-auroral at all times, and one varied from trans-auroral during the day to polar cap during the night. Fourteen frequencies within the HF band were transmitted each hour for the duration of two 24 day experimental campaigns during the summer of 1988 and the winter of 1989. From an analysis of the received signals the confidence of signal recognition and signal strength were determined. During geomagnetically undisturbed periods the propagation behaviour resembled that of mid-latitude paths. During geomagnetically disturbed times, however, night-time propagation occurred on frequencies up to and sometimes over 10 MHz above the undisturbed night-time MUF, for periods of 2 to 6 h. These features appeared on the trans-auroral paths only and were attributed to E region (and occasionally F region) enhancement by auroral precipitation. APEs (auroral E propagation events) occurred on over 50% of nights. The occurrence of APEs also coincided with ionospheric storm periods when the HF band available for propagation was otherwise significantly narrowed due to a depletion of the F region electron density","downloadUrl":"","fullTextIdentifier":null,"pdfHashValue":null,"publisher":"Elsevier","rawRecordXml":"<record><header><identifier>\n        \n            \n                oai:lra.le.ac.uk:2381\/7388<\/identifier><datestamp>\n                2011-05-09T14:49:05Z<\/datestamp><setSpec>\n                com_2381_171<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                com_2381_9549<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                col_2381_835<\/setSpec>\n            <\/header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/\" xmlns:dc=\"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/\" xmlns:doc=\"http:\/\/www.lyncode.com\/xoai\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/ http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc.xsd\" ><dc:title>\n            \nEnhanced MUF propagation of HF radio waves in the auroral zone<\/dc:title><dc:creator>\nMilan, S.E.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nJones, T.B.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nWarrington, E.
