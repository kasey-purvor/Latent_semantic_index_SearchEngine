By analogy with the paying of income tax, patients should not be\nallowed to \u2018\u2018veto\u2019\u2019 their social responsibility to take part in clinical research.\nS\no called \u2018\u2018modest proposals\u2019\u2019, those disarming challenges\nto our ability to say exactly what is wrong with an\nobnoxious conclusion, have a distinguished history,1\nhigh visibility,2 contemporary relevance in this journal,3 and\na tendency to backfire. Defoe found himself imprisoned; see\nDaniel Defoe: the Life and Strange Surprising Adventures by R West\nfor an account of the personal consequences to Defoe of his\nsatirical pamphlet, The Shortest Way with Dissenters.4 In my case\nthe trouble so far has been embarrassment rather than\nanything worse, but the urge to confess is a powerful one.\nInitially I put forward the following argument in the\ncontext of postgraduate teaching rather than of research as\nsuch, still less policy discussion. The argument was a device\nto provoke students into attacking its conclusion from the\nnow orthodox outraged defence of patient autonomy.\nUnfortunately, in putting it forward, and buttressing it\nagainst the more elementary objections that were to be\nanticipated, I found myself reluctantly sustaining, defending,\nand finally succumbing to it. Here is the initial argument in\nits simplest form:\nTHE ARGUMENT IN SHORT FORM\nIn taking advantage of publicly funded health care, more or\nless free at the point of use, and consisting in more or less the\nbest standardly available treatment for my presenting\ncondition, I am receiving treatments that have been brought\nto their present state of perfection by having been tried out\non other people first. In effect, I stand on the shoulders of\npatients who took part in past research. Do I not therefore\nhave an obligation to bear the feet of future patients by\nallowing my treatment to be included in systematic research?\nAnd should I not therefore give up (or have removed from\nme) the veto that I currently enjoy over my own participation\nin relevant clinical research?\nThis is a sort of \u2018\u2018fair\u2019s fair\u2019\u2019 argument\u2014\u2019\u2019be done by as you\ndid\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018don\u2019t hand it out if you can\u2019t take it\u2019\u2019 (or, more strictly\nin this case, \u2018\u2018don\u2019t take it if you can\u2019t hand it out\u2019\u2019).\nThe objections to the argument as I have presented it here\nare likely to be vehement, and to centre on (if not entirely\nconsist in) emphatic assertions of the moral centrality of consent\nto any ethically acceptable clinical research. In the past I have\nlodged such objections myself, and believed them.5 Now,\nhowever, and somewhat to my own dismay, I think they can\nbe met, as I will try to show in what follows.\nLIMITS UPON CONSENT\u2014AN ANALOGY WITH\nINCOME TAX\nFirst let us test the water with an analogy, which aims to\nbring out the costs of voluntarism and (by implication) the\nbenefits of compulsion.\nConsider the payment of income tax. We all know that\nincome tax isn\u2019t voluntary\u2014and furthermore we all know\nthat it could not be voluntary, and that the individual taxpayer\ncould not be granted a veto over his\/her participation in the\nscheme of redistributive taxation without risking a collapse\nof that scheme as a whole. Collectively we cannot afford\nsuch a collapse, for it would bring with it a concomitant\ncollapse in things for which the scheme pays\u2014the running\nof our civic institutions, our public services, our national\nand local amenities and infrastructure, and indeed law and\norder.\nThus the enforced payment of income tax is among other\nthings the enforced adoption of a pooled risk, pooled benefit,\ncommunitarian commitment to a more or less decently\nordered society\u2014something we all want to have, whether or\nnot we want to pay the tax. If we left taxation to the\nvolunteers there might well be a sizeable minority of\nvoluntary taxpayers bailing out the rest of us through a\nmeagre skeletal system of civic institutions and services. But\nit would be a poor and a fragile alternative to the enforced\nsystem we actually (albeit grudgingly) tolerate.\nWell, in the same way, don\u2019t we all want the best possi-\nble medical treatments, arrived at in the shortest possible\ntime by the most rapid and muscular system of clinical\nresearch that is possible? Certainly, yes: I will take it as\naxiomatic that we do. But now consider what follows from\nthe analogy so far: the current voluntary system no doubt\nenables some advances to be made at some sort of pace, but\nit is hardly the wholesale acceleration we might expect if\nthe whole system were to be put on what we might call a\n\u2018\u2018war footing\u2019\u2019. A system of obligatory participation in clini-\ncal research (albeit judiciously and compassionately regu-\nlated) would provide both speed and muscle. The relatively\n198\nwww.jmedethics.com\n on 5 November 2009 jme.bmj.comDownloaded from \nswift advance in the treatment of childhood rather than\nadult cancers owes much to the greater availability of a\npool of research subjects\u2014that is, very young children, sick or\ndying, whose participation in research is sanctioned pre-\ndominantly by desperate parents\u2014when compared with the\navailable numbers of consenting adult volunteers (R Evans,\npersonal communication, 1994).\nNow of course there might be many things that we morally\nought to do\u2014reduce our individual consumption of the\nworld\u2019s energy and resources, give money for overseas aid,\nenrol in first aid training, open our homes at Christmas time\nto those living on the streets, and so forth\u2014yet which we\nwould regard it as intolerable if society enforced our doing.\nIndeed, the enforcement of all moral duties would risk\nincoherence as a general principle, because it would empty our\nbehaviour of the voluntarism that is a conceptually necessary\npart of most moral action. The point about the analogy with\nincome tax is that participation in some institutions is, or\nought to be, conditional: the benefits which those institutions\noffer come at a price. We cannot run society well without the\ncoerciveness implicit in income tax. The analogy invites us to\nconsider the development of new medical treatments in the\nsame light.\nBut does the analogy work? In arguing that it does, I will\nconsider seven specific objections to it showing that they are\nfatal neither individually nor in combination. The implica-\ntions of the analogy\u2019s success will then be summarised\nstarkly at the end of the paper. First, the objections as\nfollows:\nOBJECTION (1): YOUR BODY IS NOT YOUR MONEY\nA standard response to any attempted analogy is to deny that\nthe analogy fits. So it might be objected here that an\nargument that works for income tax is one thing, but has no\nnecessary application to something so different from our\nmoney as our very bodies and our bodily integrity. Your body\n(or your health) is not remotely the same sort of thing as your\nmoney (or any other of your worldly goods). If you like, it is\none thing to pool our funds and quite another thing to pool\nour physiologies, the latter making no sense practically,\nmetaphysically, or morally.\nOn the face of it there is some substance to this objection.\nWe make both legal and moral distinctions between cash and\ncorpus, and have specific constraints if not outright bans on\nthe selling of body tissues, parts or\u2014how shall I put this?\u2014\nservices.\nBut we need not give up the argument at this point. These\nconstraints are placed by the state, and they can be altered or\nredirected or refocused by the state. They may concern\nprimarily, even exclusively, the risks of unregulated private or\ncommercial bodily transactions, and they may have no\nintended bearing on state sponsored transactions. My\nproposal is not at all about the sort of things that normally\nattract commercial transactions. It concerns putting aspects\nof my body\u2019s function temporarily at the service of the\ncommon good, a good in which I ordinarily share, and (as\nwill be seen) doing so in a way that is fair, scrupulous, and\nrelatively safe.\nIn that crucial respect, then, it certainly does resemble\nincome tax as a way of putting private charitable\u2014or for that\nmatter uncharitable\u2014transactions into the public arena\nwhere they can be conducted fairly and to the good of all:\nthat is the whole point of redistributive taxation and the fair\nsharing of resources that it makes possible. Thus the analogy\ncannot simply be denied or dismissed.\nFormal resemblance is not enough, of course. Objectors\nmight concede the formal analogy but complain that its\nimplications ought not seriously to be embraced because of\nother constraints. Objections (2) to (6) inclusive embody\ncomplaints of this kind, as follows.\nOBJECTION (2): RESEARCH IS RISKY\nThe objection we might now turn to is that research carries\nthe sort of uncertainties, or put more unsympathetically the\nrisk of harms, which are unacceptable within the normal\nexpectations of the clinical encounter. After all, when you go\nto see your doctor you expect that she\/he will arrange advice\nand treatment specific to you and specifically in your\ninterests, and you certainly don\u2019t expect that this will be\ndone in the interests of generating useful knowledge. If you\nvolunteer for research, that\u2019s your business\u2014but not the\nbusiness of the doctor or society more generally. She might\nsometimes invite you to contemplate the risks of entering\nresearch, but she should never expect or require it. Entering\nclinical research is risky in a way in which paying income tax\ncan never be (however painful the deductions that appear in\none\u2019s monthly payslip).\nBut this objection is naive. It completely ignores the facts\nof life about the clinical encounter. It ignores the uncomfor-\ntable truth that, from the moment you step into the\nconsulting room, you have already entered the research\ncontext on at least two counts.\nFirst, you are inevitably a beneficiary of previous\nresearch\u2014which is being applied to you, courtesy of those\npatients who were your predecessors. Second, all clinical\ninterventions are also experiments upon a study population\nof n=1, simply because your actual response to a treatment is\nunknowable in advance of trying it out. The minute you\ninvite your doctor to treat you then you have volunteered for\nan experiment, and you must accept the risks this involves\neven in the ordinary clinical context.\nAnd what, in any case, are the harms specifically at stake\nwhen you are enrolled into a clinical trial? It is a standard\nethical requirement of research that it should involve harms,\nwhich\u2014so far as we know at the outset of the trial\u2014are\nneither more grievous nor more likely than those attaching to\nthe usual standard treatment. This conception of \u2018\u2018minimal\nharm\u2019\u2019 is a proper expectation normally attaching to any\nethically appropriate experiment such as a randomised\ncontrolled trial (RCT). It may of course emerge during the\ntrial that a particular treatment is specifically harmful to\nparticular individuals. In properly conducted research such\n\u2018\u2018adverse events\u2019\u2019 are monitored and, if serious, taken as\ngrounds for intervening\u2014if necessary withdrawing the\nindividual from the trial in order to place them on better\ntolerated or more effective treatment.\nWhat\u2019s more, the culpable treatment need not be the new\ntreatment that is being tested experimentally\u2014it may as\neasily be the standard treatment against which the new\ntreatment is being compared. It may be that we discover that\nthe current standard treatment is no good for you\u2014and we\nmay discover this either in the individual, \u2018\u2018n=1\u2019\u2019, experiment\nof ordinary clinical treatment, or in the large scale controlled\nclinical trial. From your point of view, what counts is that we\nkeep a close eye on you and change your treatment if it\nappears right to do so.\nOBJECTION (3): RESEARCH DEFIES YOUR\nEXPECTATIONS OF TREATMENT\nOur hypothetical opponent will not give up on this point,\nhowever, going on to complain that much research is not\nabout treatment but concerns diagnostic methods or techni-\nques, or epidemiological data gathering that cannot possibly\noffer you the benefits of treatment.\nLet me concede this straightaway, and deal with it by\nrefining and limiting my proposal accordingly. First, I will\nPatients\u2019 right to veto their participation in research 199\nwww.jmedethics.com\n on 5 November 2009 jme.bmj.comDownloaded from \nlimit my proposal to only that research that happens to\ninvolve administering to you a treatment that you need in the\nmanagement of a condition for which you have actively\nsought advice. In other words, during the course of a normal\nclinical encounter you are prescribed treatment, which is\nindicated for your condition but in which there happens also\nto be legitimate current research interest. The usual reason\nfor this is the perennially provisional and uncertain nature of\ncurrent medical knowledge\u2014medicine can do so much for\nyou now, but preferably would be able to do far more for you\nin the future given the necessary research. (As proof of this,\nlook at how much less medicine was able to do for\ncomparable patients in the past.)\nWe can, and should, refine the proposal still further. Let us\nfor the time being countenance only those experimental\nmethods in which all patients\u2014including you\u2014are certain to\nreceive an active, indicated treatment, regardless of the\n\u2018\u2018arm\u2019\u2019 of the experiment to which you are allocated. Now\nrecall the expectations you have on presenting at the doctor\u2019s\nsurgery. You expect\u2014don\u2019t you?\u2014to get the best available\ntreatment for your condition. Well, under this proposal, you\nwill.\nFor the expectations that drive any ethically acceptable\nresearch are, standardly, that the subjects entering the trial\nwill receive treatment that is\u2014for all we know\u2014at least as\ngood as the standard treatment. This is the meaning of\n\u2018\u2018clinical equipoise\u2019\u2019, and it is normally an intellectual as well\nas an ethical requirement of any research that is genuinely\nworthy of the name.6 Let us be in no doubt about this:\ngenuine professional uncertainty about the merits of differ-\nent treatments is normally an absolute requirement for\nproceeding in research. Were this requirement not fulfilled it\nwould be because clinicians already knew or strongly\nsuspected which treatment was preferable. In such circum-\nstances they ought obviously to prescribe the preferred\ntreatment: clearly it would be specifically unethical to test\nan insubstantial or, worse, redundant question upon the\nbodies of patients.\nLet me spell out what this implies.\nRemember that when you present to your doctor, you\nexpect to\u2014and indeed normally will\u2014receive the standard\nbest available treatment. This is true of ordinary clinical\ntreatment outside the context of a clinical trial. But it remains\nequally true within the context of genuine research predicated\nupon genuine uncertainty. Suppose that treatment for your\nclinical condition is being investigated in a clinical trial com-\nparing the best current standard with an alternative treat-\nment (which may be a different substance or simply different\nformulations or dose regimes of the same substance). You\nmay get the current standard treatment; you may get\nsomething new or different. But in the genuine uncertainty,\nwhich is a prerequisite of ethically sound research, it doesn\u2019t\nmatter at the outset which treatment you get\u2014we are\nlogically bound to presume that there is no therapeutically\nrelevant difference between them, and the clinical trial is\nbeing undertaken to test that very presumption.\nNow it is true, as we\u2019ve already acknowledged, that the\nprimary objective of ordinary clinical treatment is the\nindividual benefit of the patient, whereas the primary\nobjective of medical (or any other) research is the generation\nof new knowledge and\/or the reduction of future uncertainty.\nBut these objectives are not incompatible, and whilst patients\ndo not benefit from taking part in research as such neither are\nthey disbarred from the benefits of treatment simply by taking\npart in research that involves treatment. In particular, if the\nethical requirements of an RCT as noted previously are met,\nthen your ability to benefit from treatments you will receive\nis totally unaffected.\nI think we have now disposed of objections concerning\nsystematic differences in the probable harms and benefits of\ntreatments allocated in the two contexts we are consider-\ning\u2014that is, routine clinical treatment and controlled clinical\ntrials\u2014when viewed at the point at which patients are\nenrolled in the trials. And if systematic differences emerge in\nthe course of the trial (something the trial is far better\ndesigned to uncover than is the hurly burly of routine clinical\npractice, after all) then we can swiftly adjust your treatment\non a properly informed basis.\nThere still remain, however, two further significant\ndifferences between standard clinical treatment and clinical\nresearch in the form of a RCT as described here. These are,\nfirst, that the choice of treatment in the former is made by\nthe prescribing physician and in the latter is made by a\ncomputer-generated random number sequence; and, second,\nthat for the period of the trial the patient and his physician\nmay not know exactly which treatment he is receiving.\nLet us deal with these matters separately, as we consider\nour interlocutor\u2019s next two objections.\nOBJECTION (4): INDIVIDUAL CLINICAL JUDGMENT\nIS PARAMOUNT\nNext, then, we face the objection that it is somehow wrong or\nunacceptable in the ordinary clinical encounter to substitute\na random treatment allocation process for individual clinical\njudgment, because, among other things, the clinical relation-\nship is above all a personal and not a mechanical one.\nYet this substitution can hardly be a disadvantage if we are\nto take seriously the intellectual basis of the RCT, which is\nthat the accumulation of properly controlled experimental\ndata is respectable\u2014because generalisable\u2014in a way in which\nanecdotal evidence can never be. (We may leave aside the\nvirtues of empathic interpersonal communication between\ndoctor and patient, because they should remain intact and\nunaffected by the simple engagement of a research protocol\nwith the matter of allocating treatment in a situation of\ngenuine uncertainty.) Where the efficacy of a specific\ntreatment is concerned the individual and personal prefer-\nences of the individual physician are of no especial weight\ncompared with the collective evidence available to the\nrelevant clinical community. Where genuine clinical uncer-\ntainty obtains\u2014and, to repeat, this should be an absolute\nrequirement for any ethically appropriate research\u2014then the\n\u2018\u2018hunch\u2019\u2019 of the prescribing physician is frankly neither here\nnor there. Therefore the official position of evidence-based\nbiomedicine includes the following implication: namely that\na patient whose treatment is the subject of legitimate\nresearch is not, and logically cannot be, disadvantaged just\nbecause his treatment is allocated randomly, and not hand\npicked for him by his attending physician. In any situation of\ngenuine uncertainty, and until (subsequent to the trial) we\nknow more, the random sequencer is allocating therapeuti-\ncally equivalent treatments, all of them presumed to be as\ngood as the best current standard.\nOBJECTION (5): WITHHOLDING OF INFORMATION\nIS UNACCEPTABLE\nThe remaining significant difference between the RCT and\nthe standard clinical consultation concerns what information\nis known by either the patient or his own doctor. In the usual\nclinical context the doctor chooses the treatment, and tells\nthe patient what she is prescribing to him, and in an\noutpatient setting the patient may even go and obtain it\nhimself at the pharmacy. By contrast, in the RCT there are\nusually good reasons why the patient and even his doctor\nshould not know exactly which treatment he is getting, at\nleast until after the trial.\n200 Evans\nwww.jmedethics.com\n on 5 November 2009 jme.bmj.comDownloaded from \nWell, what of it? Just what\u2019s in a name? Less, I think, than\nthe mock affection noted by James Agate in his diary (9th\nApril 1937) following a visit to Thorpe Bay without his\nantiasthma medication:\nI just can\u2019t bear to run short of\nAcetylmethyldimethylamoxidiphenyalhydrazine.7\nWe can immediately dispose of one reason for needing to\nknow the identity of the treatment, that is, to avoid\npredictable adverse reactions on the part of a given patient.\nClinical trials have inclusion and exclusion criteria for very\ngood reasons. These screen out people whose histories\nsuggest special sensitivity to particular groups of drugs or\nother good reasons to avoid contact with them. So provided\nthe inclusion and exclusion criteria for our RCT are genuinely\nfulfilled, we can assume that you as the enrolled patient are\nnot especially at risk from any of the treatment regimes in the\ntrial\u2014and remember that you were going to receive one of\nthese treatments in any case. Ordinarily, having excluded\nspecific allergies or intolerances, do you really care about\nwhether you are receiving molecule A or molecule B? Exactly\nwhat premium do you (or may you) put on being given a\nchemical name that you may not necessarily wish even to\nattempt to pronounce?\nYour doctor may be profoundly interested, of course. But\nprovided that\u2014as any ethically appropriate trial protocol\nmust provide\u2014the \u2018\u2018blinding\u2019\u2019 of treatment allocation can\ninstantly be reversed in case of an adverse event, no clinical\nmaterial disadvantage to you seems to follow from your\ndoctor being temporarily and provisionally denied this\nknowledge. Of course, a certain autonomy is lost when\nknowledge is even temporarily withheld. But this is a pretty\nthin, theoretical sense of \u2018\u2018autonomy\u2019\u2019, which I doubt you\nwould ordinarily want to exercise. The loss is substantial if\nand only if you would ordinarily value precisely that\nknowledge for its own sake. This seems, to say the least,\nunlikely in your own case\u2014or in mine. And I think it is\nunlikely in your doctor\u2019s case, either, if the return on this\n\u2018\u2018investment\u2019\u2019 of temporary ignorance is to be her\/his\nimproved ability to treat you in the future.\nFurthermore, even if you do mind this provisional\nignorance, I suggest that it is simply one small part of the\nlegitimate price you are occasionally asked to pay for access to\nthe benefits of a pooled risk, pooled benefit, collectively\nfunded health care system. And it is indeed only an\noccasional matter: it is unlikely that many treatment\nprescriptions you receive will be provided under a trial\nprotocol even under the \u2018\u2018pooling\u2019\u2019 system I am contemplat-\ning. There are, among other things, simply not enough\nresearchers, funding, or energy to bring every clinical\ninteraction under such protocols, though the more over-\nworked of our research ethics committees could perhaps be\nforgiven for doubting me on this point.\nThe position we have now reached is this. As a patient, you\nsimply are no worse off in a clinical trial: the trial costs you\nnothing. Notoriously you will receive, if anything, closer\nclinical attention in the trial than outside it, and because this\nattention is something generally sought by patients it is\nplausibly a net gain for you when enrolled as a trial subject.\nAnd medical research is of course the better for including\nyou\u2014always supposing you meet the inclusion and exclusion\ncriteria for the trial.\nThus the costs of my proposal so far are only that you have\nhad a right of veto taken away from you. What sort of a cost\nthis is, and how weighty, we shall think about next. But it\nwill have to be extremely weighty to overcome both the loss\nof the advantages listed here and the context of obligation\nthat is at the heart of the argument with which I started\u2014the\nargument that as a patient receiving treatment you already\nstand on the shoulders of past research subjects, and future\npatients need to stand on yours.\nOBJECTION (6): MOST CANNOT OPT OUT OF \u2018\u2018THE\nDEAL\u2019\u2019\nWe now find ourselves facing a larger point concerning the\ntransparency of my \u2018\u2018modest proposal\u2019\u2019. The proposal is, to\nrecall, that you lose your current right of veto over\nparticipation in appropriate clinical research in exchange\nfor your access to a system of publicly funded health care free\nat the point of use. When you need treatment, and moreover\nif\u2014and only if\u2014that treatment is the subject of ongoing\nresearch, then the prescribing, administering, and monitor-\ning of that treatment will be arranged within the terms of the\nresearch protocol. And if\u2014and only if\u2014you want to take\nadvantage of that treatment, then you do so with your eyes\nopen. You know in advance that your particular treatment\nwill be decided and appraised within a trial protocol.\nHaving decided to opt into such a system (or, perhaps to\nstay in it) then whether you are treated in a given\ncircumstance will not depend on whether a relevant trial is\ngoing on at the time. You will always be treated, if you wish\nto be treated. It is simply that if a trial is indeed going on,\nthen your treatment will be arranged within, and will\ncontribute to, the trial. And your treatment in the trial will\n(to repeat) be at least as good as the current standard\ntreatment available to you in any case, so far as the relevant\nclinical community can tell at the time of enrolling you;\nany emergent deficits will be made good as they become\nknown.\nBut now you might protest that you never actually opted\ninto such a publicly funded system at all\u2014you never \u2018\u2018bought\ninto the deal\u2019\u2019, but simply found yourself in it. (This is most\nobviously true of patients who were born and bred in a\nsociety that supports such a publicly funded system, rather\nthan those who immigrated into one.) So if you didn\u2019t opt in,\ncan you opt out\u2014for instance, on the grounds that you\ndisliked the terms of my pooled research proposal, if it had\nbeen implemented?\nWell, of course you can, if you are prepared to pay for\nprivate health care. In buying your way out of making one\nkind of contribution to publicly funded health care (your\nphysical participation in research) you at least forfeit the\nright to take up the benefits of others\u2019 contributions free of\ncharge. Whether your actual monetary payments for private\nhealth care directly benefit the publicly funded system is no\ndoubt disputable; this takes us into the detailed analysis of a\nmixed health care economy\u2014something which is beyond the\nscope of this paper. Certainly, opting out economically may\nnot be at all the same thing as absolving yourself from any\nmoral responsibility to contribute to participation in medical\nresearch.\nBut, more immediately, suppose that you cannot afford to\ndo anything other than opt in or stay in the publicly funded\nsystem. To be brutally honest I think this simply means that,\nbecause like all of us you stand on the shoulders of previous\npublic health care patients, you cannot afford to do anything\nother than be willing to support the feet of future public\nhealth care patients. In much the same way\u2014to return to my\nopening analogy\u2014few of us can afford to buy our way out of\npaying income tax by retreating to a tax haven and then\npaying directly for the services and institutions that everyone\nelse obtains through participation in a non-voluntary taxa-\ntion system. I should perhaps make it clear that I personally\ndo not hold private medical insurance or have any other\narrangements of access to private health care. The con-\nsequences of this \u2018\u2018modest proposal\u2019\u2019 therefore also apply to\nme personally.\nPatients\u2019 right to veto their participation in research 201\nwww.jmedethics.com\n on 5 November 2009 jme.bmj.comDownloaded from \nThere are, in short, some things that you can veto and\nsome things that you cannot veto. And this is one of the\nthings that\u2014suggests my modest proposal\u2014you cannot veto\nunless your income allows it.\nNow admittedly this last consideration sounds rather\ndismissive, even contemptuous of the general lack of choices\nfacing those who cannot afford to buy their way out of the\nconstraints of publicly funded services: and that means most\nof us, of course. Accordingly this brings me to consider one\nfinal, serious, objection of a general kind, as follows.\nOBJECTION (7): THE LESSONS OF HISTORY, OR THE\n\u2018\u2018SLIPPERY SLOPE\u2019\u2019\nNow it is precisely those people who cannot afford to make\nchoices like these who are the most vulnerable. Modern\nhistory\u2014since, shall we say, 1930\u2014has shown their vulner-\nability to be in need of special protection, special rights, and\nspecial exemptions. And in general I would support the\nmotives underlying these protections. But does this mean\nthat modern history also demonstrates a special, privileged\nplace for voluntarism and consent in the specific context of\nmedical research\u2014as, perhaps, the circumstances leading\nultimately to the Declaration of Helsinki might suggest? (I\nowe this objection to Steven Edwards.) Does it indicate a line\nthat simply cannot be crossed?\nThis is a serious objection, but notice that it is not a\nconceptual or logical objection to the principle of removing the\nveto. It is a historical, accidental, contingent objection. It says\nin effect that the special wrongs committed against some\npatients or pseudo patients (\u2018\u2018patients\u2019\u2019 is hardly a tolerable\nname for concentration camp prisoners) in the name of\nmedical experimentation have been so heinous, so wide-\nspread, and so disgusting that they call for special sensitiv-\nities and especially solid protections. If we override any of\nthose protections now\u2014as we apparently might if we\nadopted my proposal\u2014then we are on a slippery slope\nleading to crimes against humanity.\nThis is a strong objection or, at least, strongly worded. Of\ncourse I agree with the political sentiments behind it\u2014but I\ndo not admit it as an historically plausible objection to my\nproposal. Since it has a historical content it can be answered\nhistorically. Or, rather, we can insist that the objection must\nbe judged in historical terms. In particular anyone relying on\nit must show that the circumstances of, say, a pooled research\nnational health service are in relevant ways so sufficiently\nsimilar to those that produced past atrocities as to make\nthose very atrocities the author of our present rules.\nBut it seems clear that the circumstances are not remotely\nsimilar. No one who was a victim of them \u2018\u2018bought in\u2019\u2019 to the\ngeneral circumstances of the Nazi death camps. There was no\n\u2018\u2018deal\u2019\u2019 involving reciprocal advantages, which would be\nwaived if the costs were waived. The circumstances of what\npassed for medical care in the camps themselves bear no\nresemblance to the modern day National Health Service\n(NHS) as it operates in the UK today. The motives and\nmethods (and indeed in many instances the scientific\nconceptions) of those undertaking the Nazi experiments\nwere in the main diametrically opposite to the motives and\nmethods in contemporary medical research. To doubt this is\nto impugn the entire basis on which we as patients voluntarily\navail ourselves of current treatments, as well as to vilify those\nwho develop and provide them\u2014the very people whom we\nvoluntarily consult as our doctors. Indeed it could be said that\nbasing our regulation of the actions of contemporary medical\nresearchers even in part on our repudiation of the Nazi\nbutchers is to begin to impugn and to vilify, if only implicitly,\nour own medical research community. In a rather similar\nway, to tailor the governance of general practitioners towards\nthe attempted prevention of another Harold Shipman is,\nimplicitly, to put all general practitioners within walking\ndistance of the dock in which Shipman stood arraigned.\nPublic overreaction to a genuine scandal can itself be\nscandalous in its consequences.8\nCONCLUSION\nI think I have shown that all these objections fail. If there are\nothers that are more effective, I will be glad to learn of\nthem\u2014not least because I myself find the \u2018\u2018modest proposal\u2019\u2019\nas disconcerting as it is seemingly irresistible. If there are no\neffective objections, then I think my modest proposal must\nsucceed\u2014and that when you next consult your doctor you\nshould join me in calling for the removal of the patient\u2019s veto\nover entry into clinical research, and (of course) should waive\nthe veto yourself at the first opportunity.\nWhen I put it in those terms, even if you agree with my\narguments, you may none the less recoil again from what it\nsounds as if I might be proposing. So let me finish by\nemphasising once again just how limited a proposal it really\nis. I am proposing nothing more than the following:\nIf (1) you go to your doctor in search of treatment,\nand if (2) you are prescribed a type of treatment, which\nyour doctor competently judges that you need or from\nwhich you could benefit,\nand if (3) that type of treatment happens to be the subject\nof ongoing clinical research in a context of genuine\nequipoise (clinical uncertainty about which is the best\navailable treatment),\nand if (4) you meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria for\nentry into the relevant trial,\nand if (5) that trial is so designed that everyone enrolled in\nit will receive some active treatment or other whose relative\nmerits are genuinely unknown and thus sincerely assumed\nto be equivalent when you enter the trial\nTHEN I think it is your duty as a beneficiary of the pooled\ncost, pooled benefit NHS system to do for future patients\nexactly what past patients have done for you\u2014that is, you\nmust receive the treatment within the parameters of the\nclinical trial in question.\nIt is, in sum, your duty to take part as a subject in research,\nwhich can lead to the improvement of future treatments. In\nproperly scrutinised and properly monitored research, there is\nno basis for fearing that any harm will come to you from the\ntaking part. Much good may, and hopefully will, come to\nothers.\nAnd because not everyone can be relied on to do their duty,\nin clinical research any more than in contributing to\nnationally shared welfare, then responsibility for the decision\nmust be given to others. You should be entered into the\nresearch automatically, and if you want to obtain treatment\nin these circumstances then you should no more have a veto\nover taking part in the research than you should have a veto\nover paying your income tax.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nI am grateful to the convenors and participants of the research\nseminar series at the School of Health Science, University of Wales\nSwansea, for the opportunity to present an earlier form of this paper\nin November 2001.
