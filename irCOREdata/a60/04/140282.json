The \ncurrent nature of severance packages and the provision of outplacement may be interpreted as \na move towards normative practices within the policy making of many UK organisations. This \npaper reports on the results of a recent survey of over 600 UK organisations. The survey \ncovered organisational perspectives on redundancies and the use of outplacement in the event \nof redundancy. The results indicated a change in corporate values in the 1990\u2019s. There \nappeared to be a move towards normative practices in the management of redundancy and in \nparticular in the use of outplacement as a moderator of the potentially detrimental impact of \nthe redundancy situation. \n1 \nDownsizing, Rightsizing, Redundancy and Lay-offs \nThe UK is in the most serious recession since 1945 and many organisations are under pressure \n\u2018to restructure and reorganise in order to remain competitive. Downsizing and rightsizing are \neuphemistic terms which are all too familiar in todays business vocabulary. Reorganisation, \nclosure of parts of businesses and delayering of management have resulted in widespread job \nlosses across all industries and in organisations of all sizes, irrespective of occupational level. \nEven organisations which have previously espoused \u2018no redundancy\u2019 policies have had to \nreduce their numbers and the management of change relative to reorganisation and \nretrenchment provides just as serious a challenge to organisations as rapid expansion. This \nhas promoted redundancy and job loss policy formulation to centre stage for corporate boards \nand HR executives. In this paper we will describe how organisations are developing important \nelements of their HR policies to manage such change. \nPlanning for Redundancy \nThe purpose of downsizing or rightsizing may be presented as essential to make an \norganisation more successful, productive and competitive but the impact of redundancies on \nthose who remain may actually inhibit this. We are already familiar with the effects of \nredundancy on departing employees and the problems and opportunities it brings for those \nleaving [2] but layoffs are frmntafic for everybody involved [3] especially so if the \norganisation has not previously used enforced redundancy policies. \nFootnote 1. : This paper is based on the results of a recent survey, sponsored by Pauline Hyde & Associates and \nsupported by the IOD, which covered over 600 UK organisations from all industry types and sizes. The report \nentitled Orgunirafional Perspectives on Ourpiacentenr [l] is a-.ailable from the Human Resource Research Centre at \nCranfield School of Management. \n2 \n- \nThus, the impact of the job loss situation on an organisation can be far reaching. Departing \nemployees are subjected to considerable stress but the remaining work force can be also be \n\u2018severely affected by uncertainty and suspicion and there may be detrimental effects on \ncustomer and supplier relationships, making the organisations\u2019 external and internal \nrelationships potentially difficult and possibly damaging. \nIn the event of such turbulent times it is suggested that organisations should be encouraged to \nimplement positive policies as careful planning can help to minimise the trauma [4]. A \npositive policy should cover a number of issues before, during and after the event [5]. The \norganisation should clarify its business objectives, communicate clearly and design the \ndownsizing programme in order to avoid the uncertainty and anxiety created by the situation. \nThe positive results arising from a proactive approach include the organisation meeting its \nethical commitment to its departing employees, encouraging remaining employees to accept \nthe situation more readily, allaying their fears about the future, showing the organisation in a \nfavourable light in the business community and in society in general. Therefore, planning for \nretrenchment and in particular planning for the impact from an human resource perspective \nare very important. There is evidence from the organisations\u2019 point of view that the most \nsuccessful downsizings are those which are strategically thought out in terms of both the \nbusiness and the human resource implications. [6]. The adoption of a positive policy in the \nevent of redundancy can therefore be seen as a central part of an human resource \nmanagement philosophy which aims to secure the organisation\u2019s long term survival. \nThe benefits of outplacement \nThe use of Outplacement, a concept imported from the US in the early 1970\u2019s, may be seen as \nan integral part of the downsizing plan to help implement the change with as little trauma as \npossible both to departing and remaining employees. Outplacement is designed to help the \nredundant individual with the job search process, providing practical services such as the use of \n3 \nan office and more specific help in the form of personal counselling. The initial focus of \noutplacement service provision was at the senior executive level. Increasingly services are \n\u2018being modified to address the needs of the non executive employees who are made redundant \nand outplacement provision now ranges from individual one-to-one level counselling and job \nsearch activities to group programmes where CV compilation and job search strategies are \napplied with groups of individuals. \nOutplacement in Recession \nDue to the increasing number of redundancies on a large scale in the late 1980\u2019s and early \n1990\u2019s in the UK, there has been a surge of clients for Outplacement consultancies. In the \nUK, the \u2018Outplacement industry\u2019 has grown exponentially from a f2 million turnover in 1978 \nto over f55 million in 1992, now divided among about 200 firms offering these types of services \n[71- \nIn most instances the organisations initiating the redundancies incur the cost of outplacement \nprogrammes and although we are in the midst of a major recession, outplacement services are \nstill very much in demand. UK companies even through these financially difficult times are \ncontinuing to engage external consultants to provide services to ameliorate the detrimental \nimpact of redundancy. \nWhy do organisations use outplacement \nMany organisations have been forced to face redundancy situations in the past few months and \na number of these have provided outplacement for departing employees. Outplacement is \nbecoming an integral part of severance packages. Although some research has explored \norganisations\u2019 reasons for using outplacement [8] many aspects relating to the corporate \nperspective still remain unknown. \n4 \n- \nIssues relating to the job loss situation and use of outplacement which have not SO far been \nexposed include: corporate views on the redundancy situation, what policies have been \n\u2018instituted to deal with redundancy, how are organisations locating Outplacement services into \ntheir HR policies and practices, what do they see as the benefits, how are they evaluating the \nuse of Outplacement and what are the future requirements of industry for outplacement \nservices ? \nMethodology \nA large scale survey of organisations was implemented to address these issues. The survey \npopulation consisted of companies from all industry sectors, ranging from 200 to 50000 plus \nemployees from throughout the UK. This included users and non-users of Outplacement \nservices. A total of 628 organisations participated in the survey (a response rate of 16.2%), \nthe range of organisations responding representing all industry sectors and company sizes. \nThe survey data was obtained via a self completion questionnaire, covering the organisations\u2019 \njob losses, job loss policies, the effect on remaining employees, the services provided for \ndeparting employees and the use and perceptions of Outplacement services. The sample \nshowed no systematic bias and we therefore assume the views expressed are representative of \nthese organisations. The data was gathered over the period from September to December \n1992. \nCorporate perspectives on job loss \nThis survey, spanning a sample across all industry sectors and company sizes gave some \nindication of the severity of job losses in the UK. We found that 88% of the responding \norganisations had encountered job loss situations resulting in enforced redundancies and 57% \nof the responding organisations had used voluntary redundancies to reduce their labour forces. \n5 \nWe found that many organisations were planning for redundancies and in particular, were \nconsidering how they could best manage the event itself. A large number of organisations \n\u2018responding (over 86%) had some type of formal job loss policy. This finding corresponds \nwith another recent survey on severance practices [9] where 82% of organisations indicated \nthat they had a formal severance policy which went beyond the statutory requirements. \nPolicy on Outplacement \nIn our survey 75% offered some form of Outplacement (internal and \/ or external) service to \ntheir departing employees. External outplacement services were offered by over 62% of \norganisations. Even in recession and for large numbers of departing employees, organisations \nare providing outplacement services. Given the small scale of outplacement in the 1970\u2019s, we \nbelieve that in previous years this type of caring approach from organisations would have been \nthe exception rather than the rule. This is an indication that organisations now have normative \npolicies and practices which include the provision of outplacement services in the event of \nredundancy. Is this an expression of the caring face of the 1990\u2019s ? \nDuring the recession of the 1980\u2019s some organisations used outplacement provision for senior \nlevel employees, however this trend appears to have mushroomed in the 1990\u2019s. Many \norganisations are now providing outplacement as standard across all levels of employees. Now \nnot only senior executives but blue collar workers are being offered some type of outplacement \nprovision. This is quite significant compared to the level of help and services being offered to \nthose made redundant in the 1980\u2019s. Large numbers of individuals are now being provided for \nand organisations are picking up the cost. The underlying philosophy for this change becomes \nmore apparent in the reasons quoted for using outplacement and the perceived benefits \naccrued by organisations. \n6 \nThe perceived benefits of outplacement \nOutplacement \u201cwon\u2019t hint a layoff into a day at the beach but a good outplacementprogram can \n\u2018solve a whole lot of problems\u201d [lo]. The problems which organisations perceived to be most \nwidely addressed by the use of external outplacement were mainly of a resource nature. \nOrganisations used external outplacement services primarily because they provided specialised \nexpertise (20%) and could provide the resources and the time (18%) which were not \navailable internally. The perceived independence of external consultants was also a major \nfactor for 16% of responding organisations, external outplacement being perceived as more \ncredible, professional and objective third party help for the redundant individuals. \nPractical help with preparing CV\u2019s and learning job hunting skills (8%) and specific help such \nas counselling (6%) were also cited as important contributions from external outplacement \nservices. PR was quoted by over 6% of the organisations as a reason for using external \noutplacement services. By offering outplacement services organisations convey the image that \nthey are doing the best for their employees. \nThe Kingsland James survey [8] also cited PR as a major reason for employing external \noutplacement services and improvement of the company image as one of the primary \nobjectives (7%). In our survey the organisations indicated that this objective was met, as \n56% stated that one significant impact of using external outplacement services was that they \nhelped the external reputation of the organisation. \nOther corporate reasons for using outplacement highlighted in the Kingsland James survey [8] \nincluded helping staff to obtain new employment and reducing the emotional trauma of \nredundancy (57% and 22% respectively). Again the findings of our survey indicate that these \nobjectives are met, as 93% of organisations noted that external outplacement services both \n7 \nhelped the individual\u2019s career and also helped with the separation process for the individual \nand the organisation. \ni \n(FIGURE Reasons for using external outplacement) \nThe \u2018Survivors Syndrome\u2019 \nAdopting a proactive job loss policy means taking a positive stance in the management of the \nsituation by not only providing help for those who leave but also for those who remain. After \nthe actual downsizing event another real problem can exist for the organisation. Research has \nindicated that there can be a degree of survivors guilt [ll, 121 often termed \u2018survivors \nsyndrome\u2019 among those who stay in the organisation. The reactions of the remaining \nemployees can range from shock, animosity towards management, concern about their \ncolleagues who have left, guilt that they still have a job, to fear about the future. Thii may \nresult in the low morale, decreased confidence in the company and fragmented \ncommunication which are sometimes reported. \nUltimately any lack of trust may have a detrimental impact on the organisation\u2019s performance. \nOutplacement has been described as beneficial not only to those departing but also to easing \nthe trauma for the remaining employees. \nAddressing the \u2018Survivors Syndrome\u2019 \nOver 46% of the responding organisations perceived decreased motivation among remaining \nemployees, an indication of the potentially detrimental effects of redundancy on \u2018survivors\u2019. \n\u2018Survivors syndrome is a significant area for consideration in the light of its impact on the \nsubsequent productivity and success of the organisation. A large number (78%) of \norganisations also perceived that external outplacement had a positive impact on the \nmaintenance of morale. \na \nThe positive philosophy being adopted by organisations was apparent in the actions they took \n\u2018subsequent to the redundancies. As a consequence of the job losses a significant number of \norganisations (42%) indicated that they had increased communications with employees and \nover 17% indicated that they would increase communications in the event of further job \nlosses. Such practices as providing individuals with support through the redundancy \nexperience and increasing communication were perceived as ways to decrease some of the \nimpacts of \u2018survivors syndrome\u2019. \nHowever, for the majority of organisations the use of external outplacement did not appear to \nhave longer term effects in relation to retention. The use of outplacement consultancies had \nno observable effect on the retention of key players or on retention in general (82% and 84% \nof respondents respectively). Although the use of external outplacement was perceived to \nhave a positive effect on the external reputation of the organisation (56%), this was not \nreflected in customer \/ supplier relations, (87% of organisations reported that the use of \noutplacement made no observable change to customer \/ supplier relations). \nIt would seem that although organisational motives for using outplacement include its \nperceived ability to address survivors syndrome issues and act as an external PR exercise, the \nactual impact of outplacement has less longer term influence on the remaining employees or \non customer relations. \nThis data provides some clarification as to the organisational impetus for promoting the \nprovision of outplacement as a normative practice. There appears to be a shii in values in the \nHR philosophy now adopted by organisations which are driven not only by a sense of duty \ntowards individuals but also by the desire to ensure that a good corporate image is promoted \nin the market place and that the subsequent success of the organisation is not adversely \n9 \neffected by the redundancy situation. This is manifested in the perception that outplacement \nnot only helps those who leave but is also beneficial to remaining employees and to \n\u2018organisational image. There are dual motives in operation from the organisational point of \nview. These are not only humanitarian in nature but are also grounded in business self- \ninterest and our research shows that some organisations do consciously make use of \noutplacement as a retention and damage limitation strategy during major change. \nPrice sensitivity to external outplacement \nNearly a third of the organisations surveyed did not use external outplacement services \nbecause of the perceived expense. However, for those organisations that did use external \noutplacement services, 42% perceived the cost of the service as less than 5% of the total \nredundancy package and 88% indicated that the cost of outplacement accounted for less than \n15% of the total cost of redundancy. \nThe Kingsland James survey [S] considered the perceived value for money and found that \n49% of organisations felt that they were getting value for money for the One-to-One \nProgrammes and 56% felt that they were getting value for money for the Group \nProgrammes. There is an obvious discrepancy here between the perceptions of cost of \noutplacement services and the perceived value for money. In combination with the findings of \nthe Kingsland James report [8] this data would suggest that the discrepancy may be due to \norganisations perceiving the less expensive group programmes as cost effective but viewing the \nexpenditure on the more expensive One-to-One programmes as less cost effective. \nOther reasons quoted for not using outplacement services were also cost-related. In our \nsample 10% of organisations quoted limited numbers, and 6% the level of job as a reason \nfor not using an external service, implying that they would provide group based, jobshop \nservices for their more junior staff if there were sufficient numbers to justify the cost. Nearly \n1 \n10 \n\/- \none in six organisations did not use outplacement services because they felt that they had \nsufficient capability internally to handle the situation themselves. \nThe qualifications, professionalism and services offered by some outplacement agencies have \nrecently been questioned [13] suggesting that they often do not give value for money. More \nbusinesses are now attempting to obtain feedback. Over half the organisations in our survey \n(57%) evaluated the benefit of external outplacement services. The major methods of doing \nso were; interviews with the departing employees (84%) and peer group feedback (60%). \nThese methods of evaluation provide some feedback from the individuals who have used the \noutplacement services. While the Kingsland James survey (81 found that the major method \nfor evaluating the benefits of external outplacement was through feedback from the \nconsultancy, just over 8% of our sample evaluated the benefits in this way. \nThis is a strong indication that due to the large scale use of external outplacement agencies, \norganisations are now looking more closely at the cost and benefits of the services by obtaining \nfeed-back from the end users as opposed to the consultancies themselves. \nChanging career \nMany organisations are aware that career development is in a period of change. We are now \nin the age of \u2018knowledge workers\u2019 who are not only aware of their bargaining power in a ski \nbased market but who are also more prepared to move to achieve career advancement. The \nHR philosophy of many organisations is changing to reflect the changing management of this \npopulation of people. A large number of organisations in our survey provided development \nreviews, succession planning and career counselling (85%, 67% and 66% respectively) as \nstandard services for their employees. The propensity for increasing internal outplacement \n11 \ntype activities may be an indication of organisations expanding their internal career \ndevelopment services in the light of the changing demands of employees in the 1990\u2019s. \ni, \nThe future of the outplacement industry \nIn the present climate there is an almost unlimited pool of material for the outplacement \nindustry, however we should ask whether this trend will continue. Our survey examined \nopinions on the types of services organisations would require in the future event of more \nredundancies. The predominant emphasis amongst responding organisations was a need for \ntraining. If faced with the need for redundancies again, responding organisations indicated \nthat : training managers in successfidly handling the separation interview (48%) and training in \ncoaching and counselling (48%) would be the most beneficial services. \nIn British companies little or no training is given in how to handle redundancies. One survey \n[14] found that only 16% of people who conveyed the news had been given external advice \non how to make staff redundant. There is generally a poor standard of training in British \nmanagement. As managers are often ill equipped to fulfil this difficult task, training would be \nuseful to help them perform it sensitively and appropriately. This may be one future \ndevelopment for outplacement consultancies to consider. Even if their prospective clients wish \nto undertake outplacement activities internally, the staff who are performing this work will \nrequire training. \nTherefore with the changing needs of the work force and the expansion of internal \noutplacement programmes the future for the outplacement industry may well lie in the \nprovision of more up-stream type services such as training and development for managers in \nhandling the redundancy situation or the more broad based career portfolio management for \nthe increasingly flexible careers of the future. Undoubtedly, the outplacement industry will \nneed to review its positioning in the market place as We 1990\u2019s may mark the coming of age, \n12 \nbut with client companies and individuals demanding an irtcreasirigly professional service for \ntheir money, outplacement jit-171~ will have to prove why they are a vital component of the \n\u2018redundancy wid career development process\u201d. [ 151 \nConclusions \nIt appears that many organisations are developing a more pragmatic and positive approach \ntowards the management of redundancy and lay-offs. Policy making regarding redundancy is \nbecoming standard practice and an integral part of the HR philosophy of many companies. \nNormative policies now also contain common elements of outplacement provision as standard \nfor all levels of employees. Organisations are continuing to make use of externally provided \noutplacement services, mainly because of the perceived expertise and objectivity provided by \nconsultants from outside the organisation and a number of initiatives in the provision of \ninternally delivered services are also gaining popularity. The impetus for such a value change \nappears to contain elements of both a more caring attitude towards employees in parallel with \na concern for bottom line results which may be affected by the way redundancies are dealt \nwith. A planned downsizing exercise is more likely to work effectively when both sets of \nobjectives and outcomes are considered. \n13 \nReferences \nViney, C. and Doherty, N.
