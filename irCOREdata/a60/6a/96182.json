Introduction \n \nWhat kinds of evidence reliably support predictions of effectiveness for health and \nsocial-care interventions? There is increasing reliance on evidence that comes from \nstudies whose basic logic is that of JS Mill\u2019s method of difference. These include \nrandomized controlled trials (RCTs), case control studies, cohort studies, and some \nuses of causal Bayes nets and counterfactual-licensing models like ones commonly \ndeveloped in econometrics.  [1], [2] and references therein discuss these methods \nfurther. The topic of this paper is the venerable issue of the \u2018external validity\u2019 of \ncausal conclusions from these kinds of studies. We shall argue two claims. Claim, \nnegative: external validity is the wrong idea; claim, positive: \u2018capacities\u2019 are almost \nalways the right idea, if any idea is right.  \n \nIf correct, these claims imply big problems for policy decisions. Often in making \nthese decisions one hopes to rely on some solid Mill\u2019s-method-of-difference studies. \nIndeed many advice guides for grading policy predictions give top grades to a \nproposed policy if two good Mill\u2019s-method-of difference studies support it. But if \ncapacities are to support an effectiveness prediction from a method-of-difference \nstudy, much more evidence, and much different in kind, is required, and at two stages: \nFirst, to support the capacity claim; second to supplement this claim to ensure the \ncapacity will operate in the target situation, and operate in the expected way. So a lot \nmore work is required than hoped. To illustrate the complexities involved we consider \nMultisystemic Therapy (MST), an intervention internationally adopted to diminish \nantisocial behaviour in young people. \n \nSection 2 below explains Mill\u2019s method of difference, what it can establish, and why; \nsection 3, some sufficient conditions for claims established by method-of-difference \nstudies to be externally valid; section 4 introduces three  kinds of causal claims; \nsection 5 explains capacities and their logic; section 6 explains why reasoning with \ncapacities requires different evidence than method-of-difference studies provide; and \nsection 7 describes the discrepant findings of RCTs on Multisystemic Therapy and the \ncurrent difficulties in deciding how to interpret these results. \n \n2. Mill\u2019s Method-of-Difference Studies \n \nMill\u2019s method-of-difference studies locate differences in the probability of a selected \noutcome (O) with and without the treatment\/intervention (T) across two groups that \nhave identical distributions for all factors causally relevant to the outcome except \nthose causally downstream from the treatment. The intent is to draw a causal \nconclusion. But for that, some assumptions must be made to connect causes with \nprobabilities. The most standard one, which we shall suppose here,1,is   \n \n                                                 \n1 There are other ways to draw this connection. Probably the other most dominant is that of Holland \nand Rubin [3]. This links method-of-difference studies to effectiveness predictions via singular \ncounterfactuals. These two methods are closely connected however, which is apparent form the three \ndecades old literature connecting probabilistic causality with the probability of counterfactual \nconditionals. \nCausal Fixing (CF): The probability of an effect is fixed by the values taken \nby a full set of its causes. \n \nRCTs, case control studies, cohort studies, and some uses of causal Bayes nets and \ncounterfactual-licensing models like ones commonly developed in econometrics all \nfollow the method-of-difference logic. This logic is deductive. That is its special \nstrength. Given CF, if a positive probabilistic difference obtains and if the two groups \nhave identical distributions of other causal factors, it follows T causes O in some \nsubpopulation, \u03c6, of the population (X) of the individuals in the study that is causally \nhomogeneous with respect to O.2 The methods differ by how they try to match the \ndistribution of other causes in the two groups and sometimes by the techniques used \nto infer probabilities from observed frequencies.  \n \n \n3. External Validity \n \nWe must be careful though. A positive difference between treatment and nontreatment \ngroups shows that T causes O in some causally homogeneous subpopulation \u03c6 of X. \nThis is a very narrow conclusion, of little use as it stands. Hence enters the venerable \nproblem of external validity: When will the conclusion established for study \npopulation X hold for target population \u03b8? \n \n                                                 \n2 Note that this is consistent with T doing exactly the opposite in other \nsubpopulations. All that we can be sure of from a positive difference is just that T is \ncausally positive in some subpopulation. \n \nIt is easy to provide sufficient conditions. T causes O in any new population \u03b8 in \nwhich both \ni) The same causal laws for O hold as in X (so that the same factors will be \ncauses of O as in X);3 and \nii) Some causally homogeneous subpopulation, \u03c6, of X in which the \nprobability of O is greater in the treatment than the non-treatment groups is a \nsubpopulation of \u03b8. \nNot only are these conditions sufficient for T to cause O in \u03b8. They are also necessary \nto justify exporting study results to \u03b8. After all if \u03b8 has different causal laws or \ndifferent subpopulations than those causally positive in X it may be true that T causes \nO there but whether it does so in X is irrelevant. \n \nWhat if we back off though? Do not draw a causal conclusion; merely look at some \nprobabilistic fact, for instance the effect size: the mean difference in O between the \ntreatment and non-treatment groups in X. When will effect size be the same between \nX and \u03b8? An answer requires assumptions about how the probability of O gets fixed. \nThe most reasonable one we know is CF.4 Given CF, the following conditions are \nsufficient. The effect size is the same in \u03b8 as in X when  \ni) X and \u03b8 are the same with respect to the causal laws for O; and \nii) X and \u03b8 are the same with respect to the probability of all causally \nhomogeneous subclasses.   \nOtherwise it is an accident of the numbers.  \n                                                 \n3 If this condition doesn\u2019t hold then it makes no difference if \u03c6 is a subpopulation of \nthe new population since now \u03c6 is defined as a population in which some given set of \nfactors all have the same values. But this is irrelevant if those factors are not the \ncausal factors for O in the new population. \n4 So it seems causality must enter at some stage of reasoning. \n So, very restrictive conditions must be met for effect size to travel from study to target \npopulations. These conditions are restrictive not only in the sense that they may not \nhold widely, but also with respect to the epistemic demands they make. RCTs are now \ntaken as a gold standard in causal inference throughout healthcare and social policy \nworlds because they are supposed to best control for bias from unknown confounders. \nSo it is widely acknowledged that we generally don\u2019t know all the important causes \nfor a factor, let alone knowing the distribution of subpopulations homogeneous with \nrespect to these in the study and the target populations as ii) requires.  \n \nNor is i) easier. Most causal and probabilistic relations relied on in healthcare and \nsocial practice are not fundamental: They do not just hold, they hold on account of \nsome underlying structure that gives rise to them. When the structures are different, so \ntoo are the causal and probabilistic relations they create. For instance, stepping on the \nright-hand lever on the car floor \u2013 i.e., the throttle \u2013 causes the object the lever is \nattached to accelerate. Stepping on the lever attached to the end of a toaster produces \nsomething entirely different. In this example the underlying structures are mechanical. \nIn cases of interest for health and social policy they will be a mix of institutional, \npsychological and physical. The basic lesson is the same. Different underlying \nstructures yield different causal and probabilistic relations. The problem is we often \ndo not understand these underlying structures nor how they work to give rise to the \ncausal relations an intervention might use. So we don\u2019t know when i) is satisfied. For \nsome causal relations it may be good to assume, as one economist recently claimed, \nthat people are much the same wheresoever they are; for others that assumption can \nbe disastrous. So the demands for exporting effect size from study to target population \nare generally far too great.  \n \nA weaker conclusion concerns the direction of the effect size: When will a positive \neffect size in X be sufficient for a positive effect size in \u03b8? A number of separately \nsufficient conditions are immediately apparent. Effect-size direction will be the same  \n\u0084  If T has same effect on every individual.5 \nOr \n\u0084  If X and \u03b8  \n1. Have the same causal laws; and \n2. Unanimity: T acts in the same direction with respect to O in all causally \nhomogeneous subpopulations.6 \nOr \n\u0084  If \u03b8 has \u2018the right\u2019 subpopulations. \n \nAgain, these are strong conditions that may often fail to obtain. Is there then no other \nkind of useful conclusion to be exported more widely? We believe there often is. To \nsee what kind of conclusion that is we offer some simple distinctions among types of \ncausal claims. \n \n \n4.  Three Kinds of Causal Claims \n \n                                                 \n5 This is similar to a requirement made by Holland and Rubin [3]. \n6 Note for section 5 that this is sufficient but not necessary for the claim that T has a stable capacity to \npromote O. \nIn order to understand the route from method-of-difference studies to effectiveness \npredictions it helps to distinguish three kinds of causal claims:  \n \n1. It-works-somewhere claims: T causes O somewhere under some conditions \n(e.g. in study population X, administered by method M). \n2. Capacity claims: T has a (relatively) stable capacity to promote O. \n3. It-will-work-for-us claims: T would cause O in population \u03b8 administered as it \nwould be administered given policy P (i.e., effectiveness claims). \n \nGiven CF, method-of-difference studies can establish it-works-somewhere claims and \nmedical and social sciences work hard to do so.7 But what makes these evidence for \neffectiveness claims: T would cause O in \u03b8 administered as it would be administered \ngiven policy P (T will work for us)? The standard answer is external validity. An \nalternative is capacities. \n \n \n5. Stable Capacities \n \n\u2018T has a stable capacity to promote O.\u2019 What does this mean? Cartwright provides a \ndetailed answer in a number of places [5, 6] and there is currently a great deal of work \nby other authors on the related (possibly identical) notion of a causal power [7-10].  \nRather than pursuing these details here some examples may suffice: Masses have a \nstable capacity to move other masses towards themselves; aspirins have a relatively \nstable capacity to relieve headaches. \n                                                 \n7 See Meinert\u2019s claim, in Steven Epstein\u2019s book on diversity [4, p. 98]. \n A factor with a (relatively) stable capacity to promote O always (or across a range of \nsituations under consideration) makes the same fixed contribution towards O. But this \ncan \u2013 indeed, generally does \u2013 differ from what outcomes occur when the factor is \npresent. The mass of the earth always pulls objects towards itself even if a magnet or \nthe table-top prevents them falling. Similarly aspirins generally have a positive effect \non headaches even if my headache grows worse because of the stress of my job. At \nleast the headache isn\u2019t as bad as it would be without the aspirins. One might say that \naspirins \u2018try\u2019 to relieve the headache or that the mass of the earth \u2018tries\u2019 to make the \nbody fall, though of course no conscious effort is involved. \n \nIn reasoning about effectiveness we often assume that factors have stable capacities. \nConsider for example the canonical explanation for the failure of the California class-\nsize-reduction programme. [11] A well-conducted RCT in Tennessee established that \nsmall class sizes there improved reading scores: The study supported an it-works-\nsomewhere claim. California reduced class sizes but reading scores did not improve. \nThe usual explanation is not that the Tennessee study was flawed; nor that it was \nirrelevant due to different structural features in California; nor that it was an entirely \nlocal interactive effect from which no further lessons could be drawn.  \n \nThe canonical explanation points instead to the fact that California rolled out its \nprogramme over a short time. Suddenly class sizes were cut in half. Twice as many \nteachers were required and twice as much classroom space. Neither was available. So \nteaching quality and learning experiences went down along with class size. But not \nbecause smaller classes do not contribute positively to reading scores. Rather, so the \nexplanation goes, their good effect was offset by the bad effect of poor teaching and \npoor educational surroundings. The California scores were a result of all the \ncontributions, positive and negative, \u2018added\u2019 together, just as when a magnet and \ngravity act together on a pin that doesn\u2019t fall.  \n \nSo, some factors have relatively stable capacities and we regularly rely on that in our \nreasoning. When causes do have stable capacities, what we learn about their \ncontributions in method-of-difference studies8 can be exported to more situations than \nthose where \u2018external validity\u2019 holds. External validity in all the forms we have \ndiscussed supposes that the same facts true in the study are true in the target, whether \nthese be probabilistic facts or facts about what the factor causes (as opposed to what it \ncontributes).  \n \nThere are however two major problems with capacities. First, Mill\u2019s-method-of-\ndifference studies can\u2019t establish them. A cause can make a difference in a specific \nsituation yet there may be no stable contribution that can be relied on elsewhere. \nWhen there is a stable contribution we are entitled to what Mill called \u2018the analytic \nmethod\u2019. [12] That is, we can establish what each separate cause contributes, then rely \non some \u2018rule of combination\u2019 \u2013 like vector addition with forces or simple scalar \naddition9  \u2013 to calculate what happens when a number of causes occur together.  But \nnot all fields are open to the analytic method. Mill argued that it can be used in \n                                                 \n8 What do we learn in method-of-difference studies about the contributions of causes, \nsupposing there is a stable contribution there to begin with? What we see is an \naverage of what the cause contributes across the causally homogeneous \nsubpopulations in the study population. How we reason back from that to a \nrepresentation of its contribution that can then be slotted into a rule of combination to \npredict what happen when the cause acts in consort with other causes depends heavily \non what we otherwise know. \n9 For other rules of combination see [5] and [13]. \nmechanics and in political economy but not in chemistry. Chemistry, he thought, is \nmore holistic: How a cause behaves depends on the other factors it interacts with and \non its environment; what it does in one environment has little bearing on what it will \ndo in another.  \n \nSo it is an empirical question where capacities are likely to occur, whether a given \ncause has a stable capacity and across what range it is stable. A method-of-difference \nstudy can reveal something about the contribution of a capacity but it cannot establish \nthat there is a capacity there to begin with. How to establish that is a complicated \nmatter \u2013 just look at what it has taken to establish which causes carry forces in \nmechanics (i.e., what causes make stable contributions to motions) and how these \ncombine. Unfortunately the methodology for establishing claims that a factor has a \ncapacity is not laid out with anything like the degree of completeness and rigor \navailable for establishing other hypotheses, such as it-works-somewhere claims. \n \nNevertheless a wealth of evidence of different kinds can clearly make specific \ncapacity claims probable and when they are probable they are a powerful tool for \npredicting whether an intervention will work for us. What is observed in method-of-\ndifference studies will contribute to this evidence base but the history of mechanics \nshould remind us that a lot more is necessary as well, even if we cannot lay out a \nrecipe for what the required ingredients are. Nor should we be discouraged. There is a \nwealth of scientific successes where we have acquired just the kind of detailed \nknowledge necessary to bring together factors with different capacities to produce \nrelatively predictable outcomes, from GPS systems to heart transplanting and \nprosthetic knees. \n  \n6. Capacities and Contexts \n \nEstablishing capacity claims then is difficult, far more difficult than establishing it-\nworks-somewhere claims. This is in part because claims that a factor has a capacity to \nmake a given contribution neither make sense nor are testable in isolation.10 That\u2019s \nbecause there are a number of substantial implications that must be met if a capacity \nis to be ascribed to a factor. In particular, \u2018T has a stable capacity to promote O\u2019 \nimplies that there are facts of the matter about \n \n\u0083 Mode of operation: How T operates to promote O; \n\u0083 Necessary auxiliaries: What must be in place for T to operate to \npromote O; \n\u0083 Destroyers: What can destroy or overwhelm T\u2019s operation; \n\u0083 What other capacities promote and retard O; \n\u0083 Rule of combination: what happens when many capacities are at work \nsimultaneously? \n \nSo capacity claims make sense only relative to a far larger body of knowledge. That \nis, ultimately we need what we would call a theory. This of course runs contrary to \nmuch of the founding hope for evidence-based health and social policy. After all, \n                                                 \n10 Just consider precise claims about electromagnetic attraction and repulsion. This is never present on \nits own; gravitational attraction always acts as well. So these claims can only be properly tested by \nexperiments on the motions of charged particles if we already know how to \u2018subtract away\u2019 the \ncontributions of gravity. \nRCT  advocates like them because it seems no theory is required to do what they do \u2013 \nbut recall, what they do is to establish \u2018it-works-somewhere\u2019 claims. \n \nConsider a case using everyday physics. We choose this because it is simple, well \nunderstood and does not involve subject-specific commitments in health and social \ncare. Magnets have the capacity to lift objects. Claims about their attractive powers \nhave passed far more than two good RCTs; they have centuries of study behind them. \nImagine: you have access to a desk magnet and a large industrial magnet and you \nknow the exact strengths of these with a high degree of certainty. Should you use one \nof them to lift an object in your driveway?  That depends on features of the object and \nits surroundings.  \n \nFirst, magnets need helping factors to be effective. A desk magnet is useless for lifting \na matchstick; it is only the combination of a magnet and a metal object that produces a \nmagnetic force. To predict whether the magnet will work for you, you need to know \nwhat the necessary auxiliary factors are. \n \nThen the acceleration caused by the magnet is only one part of the story, often a small \npart. To know what happens when you use the magnet you need to know the other \nforces as well, especially gravity. The desk magnet may lift a pin but it is hopeless for \nyour car, where you need the industrial magnet. You also need to watch for other \nforces you introduce while getting the magnet in place. Perhaps the industrial magnet \nwould have lifted the car if you hadn\u2019t thrown its heavy packing case into the boot. \nFinally, you need to know how all these factors combine to produce a result. Often in \nhealth care and social contexts simple additivity is assumed: Add a good thing and the \nresults can only get better. But that doesn\u2019t work in even this familiar physics case. \nWe get so used to vector addition that we forget that it isn\u2019t simple scalar addition. \nAdd a magnetic acceleration of 42 ft\/sec\/sec to that of gravity\u2019s 32 ft\/sec\/sec and you \nwon\u2019t necessarily get 74 ft\/sec\/sec.  \n \nWhether and to what extent the magnet will be effective in the target situation \ndepends on the causal structure there. It will be hard to make even roughly accurate \npredictions without investigating that situation and making a reasonable assessment of \nwhat the overall outcome will be when the relevant factors operate together.  \n \nThis can seem daunting. But consider: You know industrial magnets would pass any \nnumber of method-of-difference studies, of any degree of stringency. But that\u2019s not \nanywhere near enough to know. None of us would rent an industrial magnet to \nremove a load of rubbish before examining the rubbish. Knowledge that magnets like \nthis can lift is only a small part of what we consider when evaluating if the magnet \nwill be effective in removing our rubbish. If this is so in everyday calculations and in \napplied science and engineering (like how to build a laser or an artificial limb), why \nexpect predicting the effects of social and healthcare interventions to be substantially \ndifferent \u2013 and substantially easier? \n \nOf course this kind of complicated causal reasoning is hard, even if we are prepared to \nbe rough in our approximations and figure out ways to tolerate uncertainties. Happily \nsometimes there are shortcuts, what psychologist Gerd Gigerenzer calls \u2018cheap \nheuristics\u2019. [14] For instance, one powerful cause can swamp everything else so we \nneedn\u2019t model the rest. If you are shooting a bullet through someone\u2019s heart you do \nnot need to measure his cholesterol to calculate his longevity. Or, as with the magnet \nand the matchstick, the absence of some necessary auxiliary can show immediately \nthat a policy will not be effective.  \n \nFailing a nice heuristic for a case, we advise: Do your best with the resources and \ntime available. But reason in a sensible way. Do not optimistically expect external \nvalidity without reason to think that sufficient conditions for it are satisfied. In the \nsame vein do not suppose that causal factors have stable capacities without good \nreason. Embrace capacities where you have reason to believe they hold since they are \na powerful tool. But then remember that more work is needed to make reasonable bets \nabout what the outcome will be when a cause with a known capacity is introduced. \nAnd recognizing that knowledge is missing at every stage, be prepared to manage \nuncertainty.  \n \nThe next section gives a child welfare example to illustrate what options may be \noverlooked when we rely on a restricted set of evidence, mostly of an it-works-\nsomewhere kind, and ignore causal capacities, both the power they might provide for \nour reasoning and the problems they entail.  \n \n \n7. Multisystemic Therapy (MST) \n \nA brief description of MST is: \n \nMST posits that youth antisocial behaviour is multi-determined and linked \nwith characteristics of the individual youth and his or her family, peer group, \nschool, and community contexts\u2026. MST interventions typically aim to \nimprove caregiver discipline practices, enhance family affective relations, \ndecrease youth association with deviant peers, increase youth association with \nprosocial peers, improve youth school or vocational performance, engage \nyouth in prosocial recreational outlets, and develop an indigenous support \nnetwork of extended family, neighbors, and friends to help caregivers achieve \nand maintain such changes.  Specific treatment techniques used to facilitate \ngains are integrated from those therapies that have the most empirical support, \nincluding cognitive behavioral, behavioral, and the pragmatic family therapies. \n[15]  \n \nMST has been widely adopted in North America and Europe and subject to many \nRCTs.  A systematic review for the Cochrane Collaboration identified thirteen studies \nas meeting the inclusion criteria for the review; it reported  that the results of these \nstudies vary. [16]  Several studies found some positive outcomes for the young people \ntreated but there is no consistency in which outcome variables show improvement; \nsome show no improvement compared with standard intervention.  A large study in \nOntario, Canada where MST was offered to juvenile delinquents, found no significant \ndifference in reconviction rates at three year follow-up. Similarly an RCT in Sweden \ninvolving 4 sites and 156 youths who met the diagnostic criteria for conduct disorder \nreports: \u2018There were no significant differences in treatment effects between the 2 \ngroups. The lack of treatment effect did not appear to be caused by site differences or \nvariations in program maturity.\u2019 [17] \n Can policy makers use these mixed findings? The positive studies appear to show that \nMST \u2018works somewhere\u2019 but how can policy makers decide whether it will work for \nthem? Current debates about MST show it is difficult to resolve these problems using \nthe concept of external validity.   \n \n \nTreatment Fidelity \n \nOne explanation for the inconsistent findings is that workers were not implementing \nthe intervention correctly. The premise \u2018T causes O\u2019 is not falsified since these were \nnot instances of T. This is offered in explanation of the poor results from the Canadian \nstudy:  \u2018[A]lthough the quality and quantity of adherence data are largely unknown, \nthe site with apparently the worst adherence had the worst outcomes.\u2019 [18, p. 454]  \n \nThe MST group, however, emphasise the importance of treatment fidelity and offer a \npackage of services to secure it. [19] The Swedish study made measuring treatment \nfidelity one of the key aims in order to test whether it explained outcomes. [20] But \ntheir fidelity scores did not differ significantly among the six MST teams.  On two \noutcome measures, higher fidelity scores were significantly correlated with higher \noutcome scores but there was no significant difference on the remaining factors.  \nTherapists with high fidelity scores were compared with those with low scores.  The \nresults were mixed. On eight measures higher scores indicated more favourable \noutcomes, while for ten measures the effect sizes indicated a negative outcome for the \ngroup with the highest fidelity measure. [17, p. 557]  \n A related claim is that as the programme becomes embedded workers become more \nexpert at applying the intervention: Programme maturity improves outcomes. Again, \nthe evidence on this is mixed. [18, p. 453 and 17, p. 557]  \n \n \nWeighing the Evidence \n \nSince treatment fidelity and programme maturity fail to provide convincing \nexplanations of the inconsistent results, the field seems confused about how to rate \nMST.  Using the advice guides for grading policy predictions, top grades could be \nawarded to it because more than two good Mill\u2019s-method-of-difference studies \nsupport it. Unfortunately, more than two good studies don\u2019t. In the health and welfare \nfield, most of the organisations that rate interventions include MST as having \ndemonstrated evidence of effectiveness.  Indeed the MST website provides a list of \nprestigious organisations that offer this endorsement. [21] But for the Canadians and \nSwedes who spent millions of pounds on the MST license and on evaluating their \nservices this endorsement has been misleading.  How should others proceed given this \nmixed message? \n \nSection 3 stated that the effect size is the same in  target population \u03b8 as in study \npopulation X when  \ni) X and \u03b8 are the same with respect to the causal laws for O; and \nii) X and \u03b8 are the same with respect to the probability of all causally \nhomogeneous subclasses.   \n The inconsistent findings indicate that these two premises are not true for Canadian \nand Swedish populations.  Either there are causal factors in Canadian and Swedish \npopulations that are significantly different from those in the positive studies in some \nUS states or their distributions are different enough to account for the differences in \neffect size. The trouble is, how do we work out what these are? Traditional advice on \nRCTs seeks to control for unknown confounders through randomization but this \nclearly is inadequate in this case since all studies were randomized.  In the positive \nRCTs the variation in the factors showing significant improvements suggests that, \neven in this group, there are different causal factors in operation.  How are we to find \nout which factors matter? \n \n \nStable Capacities \n \nInstead of some overall judgment that it will, or will not, work in new sites, can we \nidentify stable capacities in MST instead? Capacities that because of site structure \ndifferences do not produce consistently positive results?  There are some ready \ncandidates for such a label.  MST was developed using empirical research on key risk \nand protective factors for youth antisocial behaviour and incorporates empirically-\nbased treatments insofar as they exist, e.g. cognitive behavioural approaches, \nbehavioural parent training.  It has nine core treatment principles all of which have \nempirical support or are generally viewed as good practice, e.g. being positive and \nstrength focused, present-focused, action-oriented and well-defined. The focus of \ntheoretical exploration could thus be on what factors destroy or overwhelm T\u2019s \noperation, what other capacities promote or retard O, and what happens when many \nfactors are at work simultaneously.   \n \nHowever, considerable work needs to be done both in theoretical development and \ntesting to identify the contribution of other factors.  Efforts to explain the discrepant \nresults to date do not generally consider capacities but the Swedish results produce \nspeculations that fit better with the concept of capacities than with \u2018it-works\u2019 claims.  \n \nOne hypothesis, for example, is that MST had positive results compared to Treatment \nas usual (TAU). TAU varies between states and countries so negative results may \narise because TAU in those sites is so similar to MST, i.e. MST does work but so does \nTAU so policy makers need to consider their relative cost-effectiveness. [17] This is \nplausible given MST\u2019s roots in empirically supported assumptions.  However, to test \nthis hypothesis work needs to be done analysing TAU to discover how and how much \nit resembles MST. Such research might strengthen claims to have identified stable \ncapacities and help us understand how they operate in situ. \n \nOne explanation of the Swedish findings points to the differences in the social \ncontext.  In the U.S. juvenile offenders are treated by the justice system; in Sweden \nthey fall almost always within the child welfare system and this, Sundell and \ncolleagues suggest, promotes rehabilitation whatever the method. [17] However, this \nalso holds true for Norway and MST achieved positive outcomes there so any link is \nnot straightforward.  Sundell and colleagues also identify poorer and higher crime and \nsubstance abuse neighbourhoods in the U.S. as more difficult contexts where the \ngreater power of MST is required to reduce offending while the less powerful TAU is \nsufficient in Sweden. These speculations are examples of efforts to identify necessary \nauxiliaries (what must be in place for T to operate to promote O) and other factors that \npromote or retard O. However, the debate is under-developed and there is little show \nof sustained attempts to test these speculations more rigorously. \n \nOn the whole, the debate on how to interpret the results still centres around trying to \ndetermine whether MST does or does not work, sometimes deteriorating to personal \nattacks on one\u2019s opponents which suggests the disputants are unsure how to progress \nthe debate when the usual pathway of labelling an intervention as effective is blocked.   \n \n \n8. Conclusion \n \nEvidence-based policy and evidence-based practice are highly valued in health and \nsocial care.  The dominant view at present of what evidence is reliable gives greatest \nweight to evidence from RCTs.  This, it has been argued, is insufficient to meet the \nneeds of policy or practice decision makers.  A properly conducted RCT provides \nevidence that the intervention works somewhere (i.e. in the trial).  The decision \nmaker, however, needs to estimate \u2018will it work for us?\u2019  In health and social care the \nunderlying social and physical structures in which an intervention is devised cannot \nautomatically be assumed to be comparable to target localities in causally relevant \naspects (assuming we knew what these were).  Differences in institutional, \npsychological and physical factors yield different causal and probabilistic relations. \nSweden and the U.S., for example, have radically different ways of conceptualising \nand responding to antisocial behaviour among young people.  The examples cited of \nCalifornia class-size reduction and MST illustrate that we need much more \ninformation to jump from \u2018it works somewhere\u2019 to \u2018it will work for us\u2019.   \n \nThe concept of external validity is inadequate for the task since it assumes that the \nsame facts observed in the study will occur in the target and this is rarely plausible in \nhealth and social care contexts.  Stable capacities are an alternative.  A factor T that \nhas a relatively stable tendency to promote O makes a fixed contribution towards O in \nvaried situations but this can, indeed generally does, differ from what occurs when the \nfactor is present.  Other factors may neutralise or enhance the positive effects of T so \nresults can vary. While this looks a potentially more constructive way to evaluate \nadopting interventions with some RCT support, it is not simple. The methodology for \nestablishing tendency claims is not laid out with anything like the completeness or \nrigor we have for establishing it-works-somewhere claims, using, for instance, \nmethod-of-difference studies. Claims that a factor T has a stable tendency cannot be \ntested in isolation. Research has to identify how T operates to promote O; what must \nbe in place for T to operate to promote O; what can destroy or overwhelm T\u2019s \noperation; what other factors promote or retard O; and what happens when many \nfactors are at work simultaneously. Ultimately, we need theory to judge which factors \nhave stable capacities and to hypothesise when they are worth implementing. \n \nThe MST dispute illustrates the limitations of standard approaches to weighing \nevidence. MST has been subjected to several rigorous RCTs but these produced \nvaried results. For the policy maker considering whether to implement it, the current \nsituation is bewildering. There certainly is evidence that \u2018it works somewhere\u2019 but \nshould the policy maker risk adopting it?  Experiences in Canada and Sweden tell \nagainst this, whereas that of Norway favours it.  The dispute cannot be settled by a \npower struggle or by conducting more RCTs to see if the balance of success to failure \nshifts. Decision makers needs specific information to help judge whether it will be \nsuccessful in their particular social context. This requires much more theoretical \nunderstanding of how MST operates and what factors in the environment help or \nhinder it. More RCTs and other methods able to establish it-works-somewhere claims \nalone will not settle these questions. A different kind of research, testing hypotheses \nabout the role of other factors, is required to build a detailed picture of the \ncircumstances under which MST is a valuable intervention. \n \nReferences \n \n1.
