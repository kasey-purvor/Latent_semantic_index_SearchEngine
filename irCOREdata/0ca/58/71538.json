The drug\nexposure in animal studies is often measured by the area under the concentra-\ntion time curve (AUC). The classical complete data design where each animal\nis sampled for analysis once per time point is usually only applicable for large\nanimals. In the case of rats and mice, where blood sampling is restricted, the\nbatch design or the serial sacrifice design need to be considered. In batch de-\nsigns samples are taken more than once from each animal, but not at all time\npoints. In serial sacrifice designs only one sample is taken from each animal.\nThis paper presents an estimator for AUC from 0 to infinity in serial sacrifice\ndesigns, the corresponding variance and its asymptotic distribution.\nKeywords: AUC; Bootstrap; Confidence Intervals; Serial sacrifice design\nIntroduction\nTechniques to construct confidence intervals for the AUC from 0 to the last\nobserved time point tJ (AUC0\u2212tJ ) for the serial sacrifice design were presented\nin [1] and [2]. A method to construct confidence intervals for AUC0\u2212tJ for the\nbatch design can be found in [3]. Formulas for confidence intervals for AUC0\u2212tJ\nwhich are applicable to all three types of designs are presented in [4].\nIn single bolus administrations it is desirable to construct a confidence inter-\nval for the AUC from 0 to infinity (AUC0\u2212\u221e). Yuan [5] presented a method to\n1\nconstruct confidence intervals for AUC0\u2212\u221e for the serial sacrifice design under\nthe assumption of a single exponential course of the elimination phase and that\nthe elimination rate is a known fixed and inalterable value identical for all an-\nimals. This paper also addresses the assumption of a single exponential course\nof the elimination phase and that an estimate and its variance of the elimina-\ntion rate are known from a different independent study. However, in practical\nmedical research, these assumptions are hardly fulfilled.\nHere, we present an estimator and its variance for AUC0\u2212\u221e in the serial\nsacrifice design in which the elimination rate does not need to be known in\nadvance. We assume only a single exponential course of the elimination phase.\nArea Estimation\nIn a serial sacrifice design, measurements are taken at J time points tj (1 \u2264 j \u2264 J)\nand at each time point tj , blood is sampled from nj animals. Let xij (1 \u2264 i \u2264 nj)\nbe the measured drug concentration from the ith animal at time tj . Let E[xij ] =\n\u00b5xj and V [xij ] = \u03c3\n2\nxj be the population mean and population variance at time\npoint tj . To be physiological meaningful it is assumed that \u00b5xj is so large\ncompared with \u03c32xj that the range of xij is effectively positive. The theoretical\nAUC0\u2212\u221e can be defined as\nAUC0\u2212\u221e =\nK\u2211\nj=1\nwj\u00b5xj +\n\u00b5xK\n\u00b5b\u03bb (K < J) (1)\nwhere K is a fixed integer and \u00b5b\u03bb is the elimination rate constant representing\nthe slope of a single exponential function [6]. Using the linear trapezoidal rule,\nthe weights wj equal\nw1 = 12 (t2 \u2212 t1)\nwj = 12 (tj+1 \u2212 tj\u22121) (2 \u2264 j \u2264 K \u2212 1) (2)\nwK = 12 (tK \u2212 tK\u22121).\nThis AUC0\u2212\u221e can be estimated by\n\u0302AUC0\u2212\u221e =\nK\u2211\nj=1\nwjxj +\nxK\n\u03bb\u0302\n\u2212 \u03b2 (3)\n=\nK\u22121\u2211\nj=1\nwjxj + xK\n(\nwK +\n1\n\u03bb\u0302\n)\n\u2212 \u03b2\nwhere \u03b2 represent a constant for bias correction discussed later and xj is the\narithmetic mean at time point tj with E[xj ] = E[xij ] = \u00b5xj and V [xj ] = \u03c3\n2\nxj\n=\n\u03c32xjn\n\u22121\nj . In addition, let \u03bb\u0302 be the estimate of the elimination rate constant\n2\nwhich is assessed on the last J \u2212 K time points and is therefore independent\nfrom \u0302AUC0\u2212tK .\nOur representation of the theoretical AUC0\u2212\u221e ensures the stochastically in-\ndependence between\n\u2211K\nj=1 wjxj and \u03bb\u0302 which enables the straightforward deriva-\ntion of the variance for \u0302AUC0\u2212\u221e.\nThis variance for \u0302AUC0\u2212\u221e can be used to construct a bootstrap-t confidence\ninterval. Bootstrap-t confidence intervals work well on location parameter [7]\nand provide better coverage properties than bootstrap percentile confidence in-\ntervals for small sample sizes [8]. Furthermore, the bootstrap percentile method\nis only first-order accurate whereas the bootstrap-t method is second order ac-\ncurate [9].\nElimination Rate\nThe estimate \u03bb\u0302 for the elimination rate constant \u00b5b\u03bb can be calculated using\nlinear regression on the last J \u2212 K time points on the natural logarithm-\nconcentration versus time curve and can be formulated as\n\u03bb\u0302 = (\u22121)\nJ\u2211\nj=K+1\nujyj (4)\nwhere\nyij = ln(xij) +\n1\n2\n\u03c32xj\n\u00b52xj\n(5)\nuj = aj\n(\nJ\u2211\nl=K+1\na2l\n)\u22121\n(6)\naj = tj \u2212 1\nJ \u2212K\nJ\u2211\nl=K+1\ntl. (7)\nNote that yij is a bias corrected representation of the log-transformed val-\nues to ensure an unbiased estimation of the elimination rate constant. The\nstraightforward transformation using the delta method leads to E [ln(xij)] \u2248\nln(\u00b5xj )\u2212 12\u03c32xj\u00b5\u22122xj which underestimates ln(\u00b5xj ) by the constant factor 12\u03c32xj\u00b5\u22122xj .\nThe expected value and variance of the bias corrected log-transformed values\nare\nE\n[\nln(xij) +\n1\n2\n\u03c32xj\n\u00b52xj\n]\n= \u00b5yj \u2248 ln(\u00b5xj ) (8)\nV\n[\nln(xij) +\n1\n2\n\u03c32xj\n\u00b52xj\n]\n= V [ln(xij)] = \u03c32yj \u2248\n\u03c32xj\n\u00b52xj\n\u2212 1\n4\n\u03c34xj\n\u00b54xj\n.

The expected value and the variance of the elimination rate are\nE[\u03bb\u0302] = \u00b5b\u03bb = (\u22121)\nJ\u2211\nj=K+1\nuj ln\n(\n\u00b5xj\n) \u2248 (\u22121) J\u2211\nj=K+1\nuj\u00b5yj (10)\nV [\u03bb\u0302] = \u03c32b\u03bb \u2248\nJ\u2211\nj=K+1\nu2j\n(\n\u03c32xj\n\u00b52xj\n\u2212 1\n4\n\u03c34xj\n\u00b54xj\n)\n=\nJ\u2211\nj=K+1\nu2j\u03c3\n2\nyj\n.

All ele-\nments of \u03c6\u2032\u00b5 are therefore continuous at \u00b5 and the sequence Zn =\n\u221a\nn (\u03c6 (T n)\u2212 \u03c6 (\u00b5))\nconverges in distribution to N\n(\n0, \u03c6\u2032\u00b5\u03a3\n(\n\u03c6\u2032\u00b5\n)t) by the multivariate delta method\nwhich is a consequence of Taylor\u2019s theorem and Slutky\u2019s theorems [10] with\n\u03c6\u2032\u00b5\u03a3\n(\n\u03c6\u2032\u00b5\n)t = K\u22121\u2211\nj=1\nw2j\u03c3\n2\nxj + \u03c3\n2\nxK\n(\nwK +\n1\n\u00b5b\u03bb\n)2\n+\n\u00b52xK\n\u00b54b\u03bb\nJ\u2211\nj=K+1\nu2j\u03c3\n2\nyj . (28)\nNote that under the Lindeberg-Levy conditions\nlim\nn\u2192\u221e\u03b2 = limn\u2192\u221e\n\u00b5xK\n\u00b53b\u03bb\nJ\u2211\nj=K+1\nu2j\n\u03c32yj\nn\n= 0 (29)\nand\n\u2211K\nj=1 wjxj + xK \u03bb\u0302\n\u22121 is therefore an asymptotically unbiased estimator for\u2211K\nj=1 wj\u00b5xj + \u00b5xK\u00b5\n\u22121b\u03bb as shown in the Lemma.\n6\nConfidence Intervals\nA large sample approximation of the 1 \u2212 \u03b1 confidence interval for AUC0\u2212\u221e\nequals [\n\u0302AUC0\u2212\u221e \u2212 z1\u2212\u03b12\n\u03be\u221a\nn\n; \u0302AUC0\u2212\u221e + z1\u2212\u03b12\n\u03be\u221a\nn\n]\n(30)\nwhere z1\u2212\u03b12 is the 1 \u2212 \u03b12 quantile of a standard normal distribution. This\nconfidence interval depends on the unknown parameter \u03be which can be regarded\nas a function of \u00b5xj , \u00b5yj , \u03c3\n2\nxj and \u03c3\n2\nyj . In practice, this unknown variance can be\nassessed by using the corresponding estimates presented in equations 21 and 22.\nUsing the variance estimator presented in equation 20 leads to a bootstrap-t\nconfidence interval without using the inefficient nested bootstrap. The following\nbootstrap-t confidence interval at level 1\u2212\u03b1 is suggested for small sample sizes\n[\n\u0302AUC0\u2212\u221e \u2212 t\u22171\u2212\u03b12\n\u221a\nV\u0302 [ \u0302AUC0\u2212\u221e]; \u0302AUC0\u2212\u221e \u2212 t\u2217\u03b1\n2\n\u221a\nV\u0302 [ \u0302AUC0\u2212\u221e]\n]\n(31)\nwhere t\u2217\u03b1\n2\nand t\u22171\u2212\u03b12 are the corresponding quantiles of the bootstrap distribution\nof the pivot statistic. It is clear that stratified bootstrapping has to be performed\nusing the different time points as strata variables.\nSimulations\nWe use the following very simple and artificial concentration data model\nx = f (t) =\n{\nc\u22121at t \u2264 c\na exp (\u2212b (t\u2212 c)) t \u2265 c (32)\nwhich leads to\nAUC0\u2212\u221e =\na\nc\n\u222b c\n0\ntdt+ a\n\u222b \u221e\nc\nexp (\u2212b (t\u2212 c)) dt. (33)\nTo take care of the bias of the linear trapezoidal rule to approximate the\nintegral, the true AUC0\u2212\u221e was defined by equation 1 on \u00b5xj = f (t\/t = tj)\nspecified at baseline and at 10 fixed time points which is a typical number of\ntime points in a serial sacrifice design.\nEmpirical coverage probabilities of the asymptotic and bootstrap-t confi-\ndence intervals were assessed by simulations. Within each simulation run, n\nrandom samples were drawn from the different time points using normal and\nlog-normal distributed errors. We used a per time point variability of 20%\nfor normal distributed errors and 5% for log-normal distributed errors (on the\nlog-scale).\nFor the bootstrap-t confidence intervals, 1000 bootstrap replications were\nused. The empirical coverage probability are based on 5000 simulation runs\n7\nand a nominal coverage probability of 1 \u2212 \u03b1 = 0.95. The elimination rate was\ncalculated based on the last 3 time points. Source code in R [11] for calculation\nof bootstrap-t and asymptotic confidence intervals can be obtained from the\nauthors.\nResults\nTable 1: Empirical Coverage Using a Nominal Coverage Probability of 95%\nError distribution Sample size Type of confidence Interval\nper time point Asymptotic Bootstrap-t\nNormal 3 0.782 0.862\n5 0.841 0.893\n100 0.952 0.936\nLog-normal 3 0.859 0.913\n5 0.895 0.911\n100 0.942 0.948\nSimulations using sample size of 3 and 5 per time point which are typical\nsample sizes for this type of studies indicate better coverage probabilities using\nbootstrap-t confidence intervals for normal and log-normal distributed errors.\nAsymptotic confidence intervals based on the normal distribution are therefore\nnot recommended for such small sample size due to the substantial lack of\ncoverage. Using a theoretical sample size of 100 animals per time point, both the\nasymptotic and the bootstrap-t confidence intervals indicate sufficient coverage.\nFor asymmetrically distributed statistics like \u0302AUC0\u2212\u221e the bootstrap-t some-\ntimes performs poorly [12]. However, the bootstrap-t confidence interval indi-\ncate better coverage than the confidence interval based on the asymptotic normal\ndistribution for a small sample size per time point.\nExample\nThe female mice data [5] are used to calculate a 95% bootstrap-t confidence\ninterval for AUC0\u2212\u221e using 1000 bootstrap replications per time point. The\nelimination rate is calculated using data from the last three time points. The\nestimates for different AUCs in \u00b5gxhxmL\u22121 are \u0302AUC0\u221218h = 782, \u0302AUC0\u221232h =\n959 and \u0302AUC0\u2212\u221e = 1030 where \u03b2\u0302 = 6.27 and V\u0302 [ \u0302AUC0\u2212\u221e] = 72.12. Finally,\nthe 95% bootstrap-t confidence interval for AUC0\u2212\u221e ranges from 832 to 1233\n\u00b5gxhxmL\u22121 whereas the 95% confidence interval using the asymptotic normal\ndistribution ranges from 890 to 1171 \u00b5gxhxmL\u22121.\n8\nDiscussion\nThe presented estimator and its variance depend heavily on the values observed\nat time point tK . The time point tK and the subsequent time points used\nto calculate the elimination rate should be therefore chosen with care. We\nsuggest to chose tK to be greater than the minimum time to reach the maximum\nconcentration (Tmax).\nAssuming identical variability at specific time points, the variance of the\nelimination rate decrease as the sum\n\u2211J\nl=K+1 u\n2\nl decrease. To minimize the\nvariance of the elimination rate \u03c32b\u03bb the time points on which these parameter is\nestimated should be a long way away from each other.\nIn this article, we made no assumption on the error distribution and from\nthe theoretical point of view both confidence intervals presented are only asymp-\ntotically of level 1\u2212\u03b1. It would therefore be desirable to develop the exact dis-\ntribution of the presented estimate under assumption of normal and log-normal\ndistributed errors. However, the bootstrap-t confidence interval indicate better\ncoverage probabilities for small sample sizes than the confidence interval based\non the asymptotic normal distribution.\nWe assume that the availability of the covariance of \u0302AUC0\u2212tJ and the elim-\nination rate leads to an improved estimate and variance of AUC0\u2212\u221e, because\ndata points can be used twice. This covariance is subject to further research.\nAcknowledgement The authors would like to thank the Journal of Phar-\nmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics for publishing this article and giving help-\nful comments during the process of writing it.\nReferences\n[1] A.
