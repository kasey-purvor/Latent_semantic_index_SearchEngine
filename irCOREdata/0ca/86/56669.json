Holden\n(p.b.holden@open.ac.uk)\n1 Introduction\nThe AMOC transports a substantial amount of heat from\nsouth to north. If the AMOC is weakened through changes\nin surface buoyancy, Northern Atlantic cooling and South-\nern Atlantic warming is simulated in ocean models of var-\nious complexities (Stouffer et al., 2006). This effect, the\nbipolar seesaw, has been proposed (Stocker and Johnsen,\n2003) to explain the interhemispheric teleconnection of\nabrupt millennial-scale shifts in glacial climate known as\nDansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events (Dansgaard et al., 1993).\nWe here address the proposed role of the bipolar seesaw in\ndefining the characteristics of glacial terminations and the in-\nterglacials which follow them (Ganopolski and Roche, 2009;\nMasson-Delmotte et al., 2010).\nAntarctic temperature (Jouzel et al., 2007) and atmo-\nspheric methane (Loulergue et al., 2008) are illustrated in\nFig. 1a. Numerous paleorecords (Carlson, 2008) reveal that\nthe most recent termination (TI) exhibited rapid transitions\nin Northern Hemisphere climate, in approximate anti-phase\nwith change in Antarctica (Blunier et al., 1998). Antarc-\ntica warmed slowly from\u223c18 kyr BP to temperatures similar\nto preindustrial at \u223c12 kyr BP, interrupted by the Antarctic\nCold Reversal (ACR) at \u223c14 kyr BP, a cooling event which\nhas been interpreted as the southern analogue of the B\u00f8lling-\nAller\u00f8d Northern Hemisphere warming, both manifestations\nof a temporary resumption of Atlantic overturning (Blunier\net al., 1998; Barker et al., 2009). Rapid increases in methane\nprovide a proxy for rapid increases in Greenland temperature\n(Delmotte et al., 2004) and hence, according to this interpre-\ntation, for the resumption of overturning.\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n432 P.

(c) 350 kyr records of DOME F \u03b4D-inferred Antarctic temperature\nanomaly (Kawamura et al., 2007) (grey), GENIE-1 meltwater-induced (GFW-GNFW) Antarctic SAT and SST anomalies. SAT is averaged\nover Antarctica south of 71\u25e6 S. SST is averaged over all the Southern Ocean south of 62\u25e6 S. Note: the simulation in (b) includes meltwater\nforcing, but the effects in Antarctica (up to \u223c1.5 \u25e6C warming) are largely obscured by the larger changes across the terminations.\nIn contrast, the three previous terminations (TII, TIII and\nTIV) exhibit a behaviour that is quite distinct from TI, al-\nthough they display remarkable similarities to one another.\nIn each case a transient spike in Antarctic temperature (WPT)\nof up to \u223c4 \u25e6C lasting \u223c3 kyr is apparent at the start of the\ninterglacial. Recent analysis (Sime et al., 2009) suggests that\nthe isotopic composition of East Antarctic ice is less sensi-\ntive to temperature change in a warm climate, consistent with\neven higher peak Antarctic temperatures during these inter-\nglacials (at least \u223c6 \u25e6C warmer than present day), though\nthis work did not consider the warming mechanism of the\nbipolar seesaw that is addressed here. Observational evi-\ndence for WPTs in Antarctica is not confined to ice-core\nrecords. Notably, a 430 kyr Southern Ocean SST reconstruc-\ntion (Cortese et al., 2007) at ODP site 1089 (41\u25e6 S 10\u25e6 E)\ndisplayed transient warming during each of these termina-\ntions, lasting for 5\u20139 kyrs and with temperatures 2 to 3.5 \u25e6C\nwarmer than present (in addition to a \u223c2 \u25e6C transient warm-\ning lasting for 7 kyr during TI). GCM simulations have thus\nfar failed to produce a warmer Antarctica during the last in-\nterglacial (e.g. Montoya et al., 2000; Groll et al., 2005; Otto-\nBliesner et al., 2006; Masson-Delmotte et al., 2010).\nThe second striking similarity between these earlier ter-\nminations is that the methane record does not exhibit the\noscillatory behaviour that is apparent in TI, but rather dis-\nplays a single rapid jump (vertical tie-bars in Fig. 1a) late\nin the termination (which we associate with a resumption\nof overturning). In each case this methane jump coincides\nclosely with the peak in Antarctic temperature. Furthermore,\neach methane jump corresponds to an abrupt shift in Chinese\nClim.

The \u201cWeak Monsoon Intervals\u201d (Cheng\net al., 2009) which precede each of the methane shifts ap-\nproximately coincide with peaks in ice rafted debris in the\nNorth Atlantic ODP 980 core (McManus et al., 1999), sup-\nporting the view that these changes were associated with dis-\nintegrating Northern Hemisphere ice sheets.\nRecent climate model simulations have addressed this po-\ntential mechanism for early interglacial warmth. A simu-\nlation with the IPSL GCM which included a parameterisa-\ntion of Greenland melt at 126 kyr BP predicted year-round\nwarming of 0.5 \u25e6C in Antarctica, thus implicating the bipo-\nlar seesaw as a possible driver of transient warmth in MIS\n5.5 (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2010). Ganopolski and Roche\n(2009) performed idealised transient experiments across a\nglacial termination with CLIMBER-2, an Intermediate Com-\nplexity model which includes a 2.5-D statistical-dynamical\natmosphere model coupled to a zonally-averaged, three-\nbasin ocean model. These simulations produced \u223c2 \u25e6C tran-\nsient Antarctic warming in response to 0.2 Sv freshwater flux\ninto the North Atlantic and suggested that the qualitative dif-\nferences between recent terminations may result from mod-\nest differences in the rate of deglaciation.\nIt has recently been suggested that the suppression of DO\nevents (which would cool Antarctica) enables terminations\nto progress unchecked (Wolff et al., 2009). Here we pro-\npose, following Ganopolski and Roche (2009), that if the\nAMOC remains weakened throughout the termination the\nsystem will progress to a WPT state. Furthermore, we pro-\npose the WPT may eventually lead to partial collapse of the\nWAIS, leading to further warming. Thus although the ra-\ndiative forcing due to Northern Hemisphere ice sheets and\ngreenhouse gases was similar to preindustrial in the each of\nthe last three interglacials, weakened overturning together\nwith potential WAIS retreat lead to conditions in Antarctica\nduring the early stages of these interglacials which were sig-\nnificantly warmer than modern. The resumption of overturn-\ning, associated with the cessation of deglaciation meltwater,\nsubsequently cools Antarctica to conditions that are compa-\nrable to present day.\nIn order to examine the temporal history of Northern\nHemisphere meltwater feedbacks on Antarctic climate, and\nevaluate the modelling and boundary condition uncertainty,\nwe have performed three sets of experiments. The approach,\nbuilding on Holden et al. (2010), is designed to allow for the\nuncertainty that arises from structural error, the irreducible\nerror that remains when the \u201cbest\u201d parameters are applied to\na model (Rougier, 2007). The multi-millennial transient sim-\nulations required here can only be performed with an inter-\nmediate complexity model. We use GENIE-1 (Lenton et al.,\n2006), built around a low resolution 3D frictional geostrophic\nocean model. An ensemble approach is essential to quantify\nmodelling uncertainty that arises from structural limitations\nof such a model. Furthermore, we supplement the GENIE-1\nensembles with simulations using the Hadley centre coupled\nmodel HadCM3 (Gordon et al., 2000) in order to investigate\nrobustness with respect to specific structural limitations, es-\npecially related to the lack of a dynamic atmosphere. The\nthree experiments are:\ni) Two transient 800 kyr simulations with GENIE-1, one\nwhich includes the effects of glacial meltwater on ocean\ncirculation and one which neglects this feedback. These\nsimulations provide a long time-series comparison be-\ntween observations and model results and allow a qual-\nitative assessment of the role of meltwater in determin-\ning transient Northern Atlantic and Antarctic tempera-\ntures.\nii) Three ensembles of GENIE-1 transient simulations over\nglacial termination TII, applying the LGM Plausibil-\nity Constrained (LPC) parameter set which covers the\nrange of large-scale feedback strength displayed by\nmulti-model GCM ensembles (Holden et al., 2010).\nThese ensembles enable quantification of both mod-\nelling and boundary condition uncertainties, including\nan evaluation of potential WAIS retreat feedbacks.\niii) Three equilibrium simulations with HadCM3 at\n130 000 BP, performed to investigate the robustness of\nthe conclusions derived from GENIE-1, in particular\nwith respect to its simplified atmosphere and snow\nmodels.\n2 Methods\n2.1 GENIE-1\nThe intermediate complexity model GENIE-1 has been ex-\ntensively applied to investigations of the thermohaline cir-\nculation (Marsh et al., 2004) and provides the computa-\ntional efficiency required to perform large ensembles and\nquantify model uncertainty. The physical model comprises\na 3-D frictional geostrophic ocean with eddy-induced and\nisopycnal mixing coupled to a 2-D fixed wind-field Energy-\nMoisture Balance Model (EMBM) atmosphere and a dy-\nnamic and thermodynamic sea-ice component (Edwards and\nMarsh, 2005). These are coupled to a minimum spatial\nmodel of vegetation carbon, soil carbon and soil water stor-\nage (Williamson et al., 2006). The model configuration is\nas described in Lenton et al. (2006), with adjustments to the\nparameterisation of outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) ap-\nplied in the ensemble experiments and the inclusion of orog-\nraphy feedbacks for surface processes (applied throughout).\nThe adjustment to the OLR parameterisation is designed to\nallow for uncertainties in cloud and lapse rate feedbacks.\nBoth changes are detailed in Holden et al.

Data\nare derived from the LPC (LGM Plausibility Constrained) parameter set (Holden et al., 2010).\nThe 800 kyr simulations (experimental set-up described\nin Sect. 2.1.1) are performed with the traceable parameter\nset (Lenton et al., 2006). The TII ensembles (Sect. 2.1.2)\nare performed using the LPC parameter set (Holden et al.,\n2010). The LPC averaged preindustrial surface air tempera-\nture (SAT) and Atlantic overturning stream function are re-\nproduced in Fig. 2, together with ensemble standard devi-\nations. The LPC ensemble exhibits a cold Antarctic bias,\nwith Antarctic SAT\u221231\u00b1 10 \u25e6C (\u223c10 \u25e6C cooler than NCEP\ndata), likely a result of enforcing modern plausible sea-ice\ncoverage; GENIE is known to underestimate Antarctic sea-\nice (Lenton et al., 2006). The major shortcoming of ocean\ncirculation in this configuration of GENIE is the failure of\nAABW to penetrate into the Atlantic sector (Lunt et al.,\n2006). However, the LPC parameter set has been designed\nto exhibit a wide range large-scale feedback strengths (see\nSect. 2.1.2) that generally encompass the range of GCM re-\nsponses to both LGM and 2\u00d7CO2 forcing (Holden et al.,\n2010).\nIn both GENIE-1 experiments, changing atmospheric CO2\nis prescribed from ice core records (Luethi et al., 2008).\nOther greenhouse gases are neglected. We apply the orbital\nforcing of Berger (1978). Transient Laurentide and Eurasian\nIce Sheets are represented by interpolating the spatial distri-\nbution of Ice-4G (Peltier, 1994) onto the benthic \u03b418O record\n(Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005). We derive three variables for\neach grid cell representing (a) the threshold value \u03b418Oth at\nwhich the grid cell becomes ice covered, (b) the present-\nday orography h0 and (c) the incremental orography h1 at\nmaximum attainable ice thickness. When \u03b418O>\u03b418Oth, the\nheight of the ice surface h at each cell is given by the saturat-\ning relationship\nh=h0+h1 (\u03b4\n18O\u2212\u03b418Oth)\n(\u03b418O\u2212\u03b418Oth+k) (1)\nwhere h1 is derived at each cell to give the Ice-4G height\nh = hLGM when \u03b418O = \u03b418OLGM. The threshold for ice\ncover \u03b418Oth is derived from Ice-4G reconstructions at 1 kyr\nintervals from 21 kyr BP to present. The constant k is fitted\nto approximate a linear relationship between global ice vol-\nume and \u03b418O. The relationship in Eq. (1) is assumed to hold\nthroughout the 800 kyr record so that the value of \u03b418O at any\npoint in time defines the spatial distribution and orography of\nthe ice sheets globally. As the Greenland and Antarctic ice\nsheets are fixed at their preindustrial distributions in these\nsimulations, the preindustrial ice sheet configuration arises\nwhenever \u03b418O\u2264 3.37\u2030 (c.f. preindustrial \u03b418O\u223c 3.2\u2030).\nThis arises because 3.37\u2030 is the lowest threshold value as-\ncribed to any grid cell, being the value of \u03b418O in the benthic\nstack at 7 kyr BP (the most recent time when no Laurentide\nClim. Past, 6, 431\u2013443, 2010 www.clim-past.net\/6\/431\/2010\/\nP. B. Holden et al.: Interhemispheric coupling, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and warm Antarctic interglacials 435\nor Eurasian Ice-4G ice remains). When \u03b418O>\u03b418OLGM,\nice sheets are allowed to thicken (but not expand laterally)\nbeyond the Ice-4G LGM configuration. This assumption\nleads to minimum sea-levels at 433 kyr BP that are 6 m lower\nthan at the LGM. We note that the only effects of sea-level\nchange represented in GENIE-1 are on ocean salinity (and\nother ocean tracers when applicable).\nChanging ice volume is translated into meltwater fluxes\nat each grid cell, routed to the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic\nOceans assuming modern topography. Accumulating ice is\nrepresented by reduced run-off. This ensures that freshwater\nfluxes are spatially and temporally consistent with the repre-\nsentation of the ice sheets, and avoids the problems associ-\nated with an unrealistic treatment of salt compensation which\nis responsible for much of the uncertainty in the far-field re-\nsponse to freshwater forcing (Stocker et al., 2007). Only\nthe Laurentide and Eurasian Ice Sheets, which account for\n\u223c80% of global ice-sheet change (Peltier, 2004), are allowed\nto change. This eliminates the potentially confounding ef-\nfects of assuming synchronous Antarctic meltwater on ocean\ncirculation; it is well known that millennial-scale Southern\nand Northern Hemisphere changes are likely to be out of\nphase (Blunier et al., 1998). A scaling of the freshwater flux\n(parameter \u201cFFX\u201d, default value 1.5) is applied to correct\nfor isostatic depression at the ice-bedrock interface (which\nwe do not model) and for the assumption of a fixed land-sea\nmask; each of these simplifications would otherwise produce\na \u223c20% underestimation of ice-sheet volume.\nThe simulations apply an Atlantic-Pacific freshwater flux\nadjustment (parameter \u201cAPM\u201d) to correct for the \u223c0.29 Sv\nunderestimation of atmospheric moisture transport, required\nto maintain a stable Atlantic overturning (Edwards and\nMarsh, 2005). The flux adjustment is held constant during\neach transient simulation. GCM simulations suggest an un-\ncertainty of \u00b1 0.15 Sv in this flux, especially relevant to cli-\nmate states that differ from modern (Zaucker and Broecker,\n1992). However, although the neglect of atmospheric trans-\nport feedbacks quantitatively alters the modelled sensitivity\nto transient meltwater fluxes (Marsh et al., 2004), the ensem-\nble is designed to cover the range of possible sensitivities,\nvarying APM in the range 0.05 to 0.64 Sv across the LPC\nensemble members.\n2.1.1 Transient GENIE-1 800 kyr simulations\nThe climatology of the traceable parameter set used in the\n800 kyr simulations is discussed in detail elsewhere (Lenton\net al., 2006). The equilibrium climate sensitivity of this pa-\nrameterisation to a doubling of CO2 is 3.4 \u25e6C, slightly higher\nthan the value of 3.2 \u25e6C in the configuration of Lenton et\nal. (2006) due to the increased snow albedo feedback that\narises from the inclusion of a lapse rate-related orography\neffect for temperature-driven surface processes. A lapse rate\nadjustment is not applied for atmospheric processes as these\nrepresent averages through the depth of the 1-layer atmo-\nsphere. Surface air temperature is thus calculated (and pre-\nsented throughout) in terms of a sea-level equivalent. Two\nsimulations are performed: GFW, which includes the effects\nof glacial meltwater on ocean circulation (FFX = 1.5), and\nGNFW which neglects this feedback (FFX = 0).\n2.1.2 Transient GENIE-1 Termination II ensembles\nThree ensembles of transient simulations over TII (provid-\ning approximate analogues for TIII and TIV) are performed,\ndiffering in the boundary conditions applied in order to in-\nvestigate uncertainties in forcing. Ensemble members are\nweakly constrained to produce plausible preindustrial and\nLGM climate states by applying the 480 member LPC pa-\nrameter set, which varies 26 parameters over wide ranges\n(see Table 1 of Holden et al., 2010). The LPC parameters\nproduce modern-plausible global average SAT, Atlantic over-\nturning, Antarctic sea-ice coverage and land carbon storage,\nwith distributions that are approximately centred on observa-\ntions, and are additionally constrained to simulate plausible\nLGM Antarctic cooling (of 6\u201312 \u25e6C), though we note that\nglacial cooling of Antarctica may be overstated due to diffu-\nsive heat transport that is driven by cooling due to Northern\nHemisphere ice sheets. The approach is designed to quantify\nmodel error by allowing parametric uncertainty to dominate\nover structural error. The ensemble members exhibit a wide\nrange of ocean, atmospheric, sea-ice and vegetation feedback\nstrengths which generally encompass the range of large-scale\nGCM responses to 2\u00d7CO2 and LGM forcing, with a distri-\nbution for climate sensitivity of 3.8\u00b1 0.6 \u25e6C and for LGM\nglobally averaged cooling of 5.9\u00b1 1.2 \u25e6C (c.f. 5.8\u00b1 1.4 \u25e6C,\nSchneider von Deimling et al., 2006).\nThe three ensembles are:\ni) EFW which includes the impact of meltwater runoff on\nocean circulation (Sect. 2.1) and allows for uncertainty\nin the strength of this feedback by varying FFX (in ad-\ndition to 25 other parameters), uniformly distributed in\nthe range 1 to 2,\nii) ENFW which neglects the role of meltwater (FFX = 0 in\nall ensemble members), and\niii) EWAIS which is identical to EFW except that the WAIS\nis replaced with land at sea level. Ice-sheet mod-\nels (Pollard and DeConto, 2009) have simulated sub-\nstantial WAIS retreat driven by sea-level rise at termi-\nnations (neglecting the additional bipolar forcing ad-\ndressed here). Several lines of indirect evidence sug-\ngest that WAIS retreat contributed to the observed el-\nevated sea levels during the last interglacial (Overpeck\net al., 2006; Kopp et al., 2009). We capture the un-\ncertainty associated with the degree and timing of po-\ntential WAIS retreat through the two extreme boundary\nconditions of EFW and EWAIS. The modern WAIS com-\nprises both marine-based and land-based ice. For con-\nsistency with the HadCM3 simulation (see Sect. 2.2),\nwww.clim-past.net\/6\/431\/2010\/ Clim. Past, 6, 431\u2013443, 2010\n436 P. B. Holden et al.: Interhemispheric coupling, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and warm Antarctic interglacials\nwe assume the WAIS is removed and replaced entirely\nby ice-free land in the EWAIS ensemble. We note that\nreplacing WAIS with ocean instead of land was found\nto simulate slightly higher peak Antarctic SAT anoma-\nlies (2.8 \u25e6C c.f. 2.2 \u25e6C) in exploratory 650 kyr transient\nGENIE-1 simulations not described here.\nMelting of the WAIS, triggered by sea-level rise or local\nwarming, would release meltwater to the southern ocean,\npotentially reducing convection and hence reducing local\nwarming (Weaver et al., 2003; Swingedouw et al., 2009).\nGiven the substantial uncertainties involved, however, we do\nnot attempt to model this feedback in the present study. A\nhosing flux of 0.1 Sv into the Southern Ocean applied for\n1000 years (equivalent in magnitude to the complete loss of\nWAIS ice in 650 years) simulated Antarctic SAT cooling of\n\u223c0.5 \u25e6C in the preindustrial climate state (Swingedouw et al.,\n2009). Transient Southern Ocean cooling events of this mag-\nnitude would not be inconsistent with \u201ccooling rebounds\u201d of\nup to \u223c1 \u25e6C that have been observed in several high south-\nern latitude locations during the later stages of each of the\nlast five terminations (Cortese et al., 2007, and references\ntherein).\nTransient CO2, orbit and ice sheets are applied as for the\nlong simulations, except that the benthic \u03b418O record is lin-\nearised across the termination to produce an approximately\nconstant (\u00b1 20%) meltwater pulse, eliminating the oscilla-\ntory behaviour simulated during TII in the 800 kyr simulation\n(see Fig. 1c). This oscillatory behaviour is not apparent in\nobservations and is largely a consequence of translating the\ntemporal signal in the gradient of benthic \u03b418O into global\nice-sheet change. The temporal development of ice sheet\nvolume (only Laurentide and Eurasian ice sheets contribu-\ntions are considered here) and the resulting meltwater flux\nis illustrated in Fig. 3. As in the 800 kyr simulation, melt-\nwater is routed into the ocean assuming modern topography.\nThe meltwater pulse commences at 135 000 BP and lasts for\n\u223c7600 years with an average of\u223c0.11 Sv, equivalent to 76 m\nsea level, but varying between ensemble members (\u223c0.07 to\n0.15 Sv) through the freshwater scaling parameter FFX. Sim-\nulations are spun-up to equilibrium at 135 000 BP and run for\n11 000 years.\n2.2 HadCM3 snapshot simulations\nThe snapshot simulations are performed using the Hadley\nCentre coupled model HadCM3 (Gordon et al., 2000), a\ncoupled atmosphere (2.5\u25e6\u00d73.75\u25e6\u00d719 vertical levels)\/ocean\n(1.25\u25e6\u00d7 1.25\u25e6\u00d7 20 vertical levels) model which does not\nrequire flux adjustments to prevent climate drifts.

Meltwater is calculated at each grid cell and routed to\nthe ocean assuming modern day topography. The dashed line illus-\ntrates total Laurentide and Eurasian ice sheet volume, expressed in\nequivalent meters of sea-level. The solid lines illustrates the profile\nof ensemble mean meltwater flux (bold, FFX = 1.5) and the range\nof meltwater fluxes (FFX = 1.0 to FFX = 2.0). The temporal devel-\nopment of meltwater is fixed across all ensemble members.\nentirely by ice-free land (at an elevation of 200 m), in or-\nder to avoid ocean time-stepping instabilities which arise due\nto converging meridians near the pole (which are resolved\nwith Fourier filtering at the North Pole). As noted above,\nin GENIE-1 simulations, replacing WAIS with ocean rather\nthan land resulted in a modest increase in warming. Simula-\ntions are run for 200 years (from the modern spun-up state)\nand averaged over the last 30 years.\n3 Results\n3.1 800 kyr GENIE-1 Transient Simulations\nFigure 1b compares 800 kyr records of i) modelled Antarc-\ntic SAT anomaly with DOME C (Jouzel et al., 2007) and\nii) modelled SST anomaly (with a North Atlantic planktonic\n\u03b418O record (Venz et al., 1999) which we have mapped onto\nthe LR04 timescale (Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005). Model data\nare from the simulation GFW (which includes meltwater forc-\ning). We note the generally good agreement with both sets\nof observational data, with the exception of the marked fail-\nure to predict the existence of Antarctic WPTs. A similar\ndiscrepancy is not apparent in the North Atlantic record and\nwe infer that WPTs are likely driven by an absent Southern\nHemisphere forcing. MIS 7 is particularly interesting in this\nregard as the \u03b418O record suggest that substantial Northern\nHemisphere ice sheets remained in place during this inter-\nglacial, so that temperatures \u223c2 \u25e6C higher than preindustrial\nagain suggest the WPT warming was localised to the South-\nern Hemisphere. For completeness we note that orbitally-\nClim. Past, 6, 431\u2013443, 2010 www.clim-past.net\/6\/431\/2010\/\nP. B. Holden et al.: Interhemispheric coupling, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and warm Antarctic interglacials 437\nforced summer warming is simulated at high northern lat-\nitudes during the Eemian, with maximum summer warm-\ning (averaged over all grid points north of 62\u25e6 N) peaking\nat 3.5 \u25e6C in 126 000 BP.\nThe first plot in Fig. 1c is the 350 kyr DOME F tem-\nperature record, reconstructed from \u03b418O and \u03b4D isotopic\nrecords, correcting for vapour source temperature and seawa-\nter isotopic composition variations (Kawamura et al., 2007).\nDOME F was chosen as it lies south of the Atlantic (77\u25e6 S,\n39\u25e6 E) and may be expected to be more strongly influenced\nby AMOC changes than DOME C (75\u25e6 S, 123\u25e6 E). In addi-\ntion to the WPTs, and the warm spike in the early Holocene,\nthree interstadials at DOME F are warmer than preindus-\ntrial at 317, 218 and 200 kyr BP. These three interstadials\nare observed to be at least \u223c1 \u25e6C cooler than preindustrial at\nDOME C (Fig. 1b), though we note that these apparent tem-\nperature differences between DOME C and DOME F may al-\nternatively reflect spatial variations in the seasonality of pre-\ncipitation in a warm Antarctica (Sime et al., 2009).\nAntarctic SAT and SST meltwater anomalies (GFW-GNFW,\ni.e. the differences in temperature when meltwater is im-\nposed) are plotted in Fig. 1c and reflect the impact of melt-\nwater on ocean circulation and heat transport. The SAT melt-\nwater anomaly displays the millennial variability apparent in\nobservations; the SST meltwater anomaly exhibits a simi-\nlar temporal behaviour, though variability is suppressed by\nhigh-latitude sea ice during glacial periods. The SST melt-\nwater spikes coincide very closely with spikes in isotope-\ninferred temperature. Late Pleistocene LR04 age-model un-\ncertainty (the age model which defines the meltwater timing\nthrough the gradient of the benthic \u03b418O) is estimated at 4 kyr\n(Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005).\nThe timing of large scale meltwater spikes reflects large\nchanges in \u03b418O and is likely to be robust (though subject\nto the aforementioned age-model uncertainties). However,\nthis is not the case with respect to the detail and timing of\nthe millennial variability, including that which is simulated\nduring terminations. These features arise from variability in\nthe gradient of the benthic \u03b418O signal, which translates into\nthe meltwater fluxes. Although variability in ice-sheet melt\nrates presumably contributes to this signal, contributions also\narise from a number of additional sources, notably includ-\ning uncertainty in observational values of \u03b418O; 1\u03c3 errors\nof up to \u223c0.1\u2030 (Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005) are compara-\nble to the average millennial decrease of \u223c0.2\u2030 across a\ntermination. The transient Antarctic SAT cooling of \u223c1 \u25e6C\nthat occurs at the end of each termination (Fig. 1c) arises\ndue to the positive Atlantic overturning cell extending further\nsouth during the reorganisation of the circulation at the end\nof the meltwater pulse. We note that in the ensemble analysis\n(Sect. 3.2) this transient cooling generally arises in those sim-\nulations in which the AMOC recovers. Amongst these 155\nsimulations, ensemble averaged cooling of 0.9\u00b1 0.9 \u25e6C oc-\ncurs 1400\u00b1 900 years after the cessation of meltwater. This\nmay not be a robust feature of the simulations, especially\ngiven the abrupt cessation of the forcing (Fig. 3). The cool-\ning does not arise in the TII ensemble average (c.f. blue and\npink curves in Fig. 4e), in part due to differences in the tim-\ning of these cooling events and in part due to the masking\neffect of the 19 simulations in which the AMOC does not\nrecover and Antarctica remains warm.\n3.2 GENIE-1 ensembles of transient simulations over\nTermination II\nAlthough there is strong chronological similarity between\nobserved and simulated warming, the magnitude of Antarctic\nSAT spikes in the single 800 kyr simulation GFW (\u223c1.5 \u25e6C,\nFig. 1c and seen in Fig. 1b as small oscillations near the top\nof each simulated SAT rise) is insufficient to explain the ob-\nserved warmings of \u223c4 \u25e6C above present (Fig. 1b). Quan-\ntification of the discrepancy requires an assessment of mod-\nelling uncertainities; we apply an ensemble methodology to\nascertain the most probable model response and quantify un-\ncertainty.\nThe 480 meltwater-forced ensemble members EFW univer-\nsally exhibited weakened overturning during the termination\n(average weakening at 128 000 BP of 9\u00b1 5 Sv with respect\nto preindustrial). Antarctic SAT at 128 000 BP is >0.5 \u25e6C\nwarmer than preindustrial in 110 of these simulations, all of\nwhich exhibited a collapse of overturning (peak overturning\n<6 Sv north of 44\u25e6 N), demonstrating that AMOC collapse is\nrequired for significant Antarctic warming in GENIE-1. We\nconfine analysis to the 174 parameter sets with maximum\noverturning <6 Sv to quantify the range of response.\nFigure 4a illustrates the meltwater-forced SST anomaly at\n128 500 BP (EFW-ENFW, i.e. the ensemble-averaged change\nin SST when meltwater is imposed) and displays the char-\nacteristic behaviour of the bipolar seesaw, although cer-\ntain atmospheric feedbacks, such as the southward shift\nof the ITCZ, cannot be captured by the fixed-wind field\nEMBM. South of 62\u25e6 S, ensemble-averaged SST warming of\n0.4\u00b1 0.3 \u25e6C is simulated (uncertainties are expressed as 1\u03c3\nensemble standard deviations throughout). Modern obser-\nvations indicate that basal melt rates at the WAIS grounding\nline increase by\u223c1 m yr\u22121 for a 0.1 \u25e6C increase in SST (Rig-\nnot and Jacobs, 2002), suggesting that the simulated warm-\ning may be significant for WAIS instability. Ice-sheet mod-\nelling has indicated that a 10 myr\u22121 increase in Antarctic\nbasal melt rates leads to sea level rise of \u223c25 cm per cen-\ntury (Huybrechts and de Wolde, 1999). The ensemble de-\nsign allows a wide range of sea-ice responses, with annual\naverage Antarctic sea ice extent increasing by 9\u201315 million\nkm2 under LGM forcing and decreasing by 5\u20139 million km2\nunder 2\u00d7CO2 forcing (Holden et al., 2010). Meltwater-\nforced reduction in Antarctic sea-ice area at 128 500 BP is\n2.7\u00b1 1.6 million km2. The simulated retreat of Antarctic\nsea ice is consistent with the southerly shift of productiv-\nity inferred from barium rain rates during MIS5.5 which can\nonly be explained by a reduction in Antarctic sea ice (Nuern-\nwww.clim-past.net\/6\/431\/2010\/ Clim.

(e) Ensemble-averaged temporal behaviour of East Antarctic SAT anomaly.\nThe dashed green line is the ensemble-averaged (EFW) Atlantic overturning (maximum streamfunction at depths below 400 m). The grey\nline is the DOME C deuterium inferred anomaly (Jouzel et al., 2007).

(f) Ensemble distributions of East Antarctic SAT anomaly at 128 500 BP.\nberg et al., 1997). The ensemble member with the largest\nmeltwater-induced loss of annually-averaged Antarctic sea\nice (7.9 million km2) is associated with an East Antarctic\nSAT 2.4 \u25e6C warmer than preindustrial, while the greatest East\nAntarctic warming, 4.7 \u25e6C above preindustrial, is associated\nwith the loss of 4.8 million km2 of Antarctic sea-ice. Thus\nthe possibility that WPTs could be explained without a sub-\nstantial WAIS retreat feedback appears unlikely (only six of\nthe 174 EFW simulations exhibit East Antarctic temperatures\ngreater than 2.5 \u25e6C above preindustrial), but cannot be ruled\nout.\nFigure 4b\u2013d illustrates ensemble-averaged SAT anomalies\nat 128 500 BP with respect to an equilibrium ensemble EPI\nforced with preindustrial boundary conditions. In the ab-\nsence of meltwater forcing (Fig. 4b), East Antarctic SAT is\n1.0\u00b1 0.6 \u25e6C cooler than preindustrial (despite slightly higher\natmospheric CO2 concentrations of \u223c285 ppm). This re-\nflects a combination of global cooling due to the inferred\nremnant of the Laurentide ice sheet (which may be over-\nstated in Antarctica due to the over-diffusive atmosphere)\nand lower Antarctic summer insolation; a single 800 kyr\ntransient simulation forced only with orbital changes pre-\nClim.

Holden et al.: Interhemispheric coupling, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and warm Antarctic interglacials 439\ndicts annually averaged Antarctic temperatures 0.6 \u25e6C below\npreindustrial at this time (ice sheets and atmospheric CO2\nfixed at glacial conditions throughout). Meltwater forcing\n(Fig. 4c) increases East Antarctic SAT by 1.6\u00b1 1.0 \u25e6C (to\n0.5\u00b1 1.0 \u25e6C warmer than preindustrial). In these simula-\ntions, the bipolar warming of Antarctica peaks in the At-\nlantic sector (i.e. in the vicinity of the forcing), with maxi-\nmum warming at\u223c15\u25e6 E (Fig. 4c), in the approximate vicin-\nity of DOME F. This is qualitatively consistent with observa-\ntions which indicate that interstadial temperatures may have\nbeen higher at DOME F than at DOME C. The removal of\nWAIS (Fig. 4d) introduces further East Antarctic warming of\n1.2\u00b1 0.6 \u25e6C (to 1.6\u00b1 1.3 \u25e6C warmer than preindustrial) aris-\ning from widespread loss of West Antarctic summer snow\ncover and reduced albedo. Within ensemble EWAIS, 39 of the\n174 simulations exhibit East Antarctic temperatures greater\nthan 2.5 \u25e6C above preindustrial.\nFigure 4e summarises the temporal development of\nensemble-averaged East Antarctic SAT under the three forc-\ning scenarios. We do not regard WAIS retreat early in the ter-\nmination as realistic; in the absence of a dynamic ice-sheet\nmodel we have simply assumed WAIS is absent throughout\nthe EWAIS run, so the temporal behaviour would more rea-\nsonably be described by a transition from the EFW ensem-\nble towards the EWAIS ensemble (implying a warming rate\ngreater than either ensemble and hence closer to observa-\ntions). Maximum overturning is also illustrated. In con-\ntrast to paleoclimatic evidence suggesting that glacial (LGM)\noverturning was weaker than today (McManus et al., 2004),\nGENIE-1 ensemble-averaged overturning is stronger in the\nglacial state. However, this change is of unclear sign, with 63\nof the 174 simulations displaying a weakened overturning at\n135 000 BP (ensemble average 0.9\u00b1 2.6 Sv relative to prein-\ndustrial). The modelled resumption of overturning (com-\nmencing at 127 500 BP) is within \u223c1500 years of the ob-\nserved methane jump (commencing at 129 000 BP, Fig. 1a),\nless than the 4 kyr age model uncertainty of the benthic \u03b418O\nstack (Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005). We note that coral reef\nevidence indicates that the onset of Northern Hemisphere\ndeglaciation occurred \u223c4500 years earlier (Thomas et al.,\n2009) than is suggested by a sea-level reconstruction derived\nfrom this benthic \u03b418O stack (Bintanja et al., 2005).\nThe ENFW ensemble distribution of East Antarctic SAT\n(Fig. 4f) illustrates that no point in our parameter space is\ncapable of reconciling GENIE-1 with observations in the\nabsence of substantial AMOC weakening (though we note\nthat \u223c10% of the simulations exhibit AMOC collapse in the\nabsence of meltwater forcing). However, the two extreme\nboundary conditions represented by the distributions of EFW\nand EWAIS encompass the observational estimate of \u223c4 \u25e6C\nwarming. Although we do not rule out the possibility that\nthe bipolar seesaw could explain the discrepancy without a\nsubstantial WAIS feedback, we note that the observed East\nAntarctic warming of\u223c2 \u25e6C which persists after the resump-\ntion of overturning can only be explained in the GENIE-1 en-\nsembles with the assumption of some WAIS retreat (or alter-\nnatively with an overturning that remains weakened through-\nout the interglacial \u2013 the AMOC does not recover from its\ncollapsed state in 19 of the 174 simulations).\n3.3 HadCM3 Eemian simulations\nIn order to investigate the robustness of the GENIE-1 ensem-\nbles, in particular with regard to the simplified atmosphere\nand snow models, we performed four equilibrium HadCM3\nsimulations. Hosing induces AMOC collapse and results in\nstatistically significant warming of \u223c0.2\u20130.5 \u25e6C in summer\n(DJF) SST in the Weddell and Ross Seas (Fig. 5a), accom-\npanied by a reduction in Antarctic summer sea-ice extent\nand depth. A multi-model hosing ensemble (0.1 Sv, modern\nboundary conditions), performed to investigate inter-model\nuncertainty in response to hosing, also simulated warming in\nthe Weddell Sea, apparently a consequence of enhanced deep\nconvection and reduced sea ice (Stouffer et al., 2006).\nIn the absence of meltwater and ice-sheet forcing (Fig. 5b)\nHadCM3 fails to predict significant Antarctic SAT increase,\nthough orbitally-forced summer warming of 3.0 \u25e6C is sim-\nulated in Greenland. With freshwater hosing, precipitation-\nweighted SAT (Fig. 5c) increases by 2.2 \u25e6C at DOME F and\n1.4 \u25e6C at DOME C, supporting GENIE-1 (annual-average\nEast Antarctic warming of 1.6\u00b1 1.0 \u25e6C). This warming is\nachieved after \u223c100 years of the 200 year simulation.\nThe removal of WAIS (Fig. 5d) increases the precipitation-\nweighted SAT anomaly to 4.9 \u25e6C at DOME F and to 5.0 \u25e6C\nat DOME C. Increased summer precipitation combines with\ngreatest warming in summer when widespread West Antarc-\ntic snow melt is simulated. The HFW and HWAIS simulations\nencompass observed WPT warming. As the GENIE-1 en-\nsemble parameterisations were designed to provide an unbi-\nased estimate of the uncertainty associated with large-scale\nprocesses, EFW and EWAIS East Antarctic SAT variability of\n\u00b1 1.0 \u25e6C and \u00b1 1.3 \u25e6C provide indicative lower-bound mea-\nsures of the parametric uncertainty in these single HadCM3\nsimulations.\n4 Discussion\ni) The 800 kyr simulations demonstrate that GENIE-1, to-\ngether with the imposed transient boundary conditions,\nis able to reproduce g-ig temperature change at the di-\nverse locations of the Antarctic and the North Atlantic\nover 800 000 years, effectively providing an extensive\nvalidation of modelled climate change for the full range\nof climate states and the entire period of the record.\nHowever, these simulations fail to reproduce Antarctic\nwarmth that is significantly greater than present at any\npoint in time, a failure which takes on a greater signif-\nicance in view of the success of the model elsewhere\nin the record. Furthermore, the simulations demonstrate\nwww.clim-past.net\/6\/431\/2010\/ Clim. Past, 6, 431\u2013443, 2010\n440 P. B.

We note that the tim-\ning, magnitude and spatial distribution of the meltwater\nforcing is largely independent of the DOME F chronol-\nogy (derived by tuning the O2\/N2 ratio of trapped air\nbubbles to 21 December insolation at 77\u25e6 S); the melt-\nwater forcing is derived from an interpolation of the spa-\ntial distribution of Ice-4G onto the benthic \u03b418O stack\n(with an age model derived from a simple ice model\ndriven by 21 June insolation at 65\u25e6 N).\nii) The TII ensembles provide a quantification of the un-\ncertainty that arises from structural, parametric and\nboundary condition sources. The meltwater-induced\ncollapse of Atlantic overturning leads to simulated East\nAntarctic warming at 128 500 BP (of 1.6\u00b1 1.0 \u25e6C) to\n0.5\u00b1 1.0 \u25e6C above preindustrial. The ensemble av-\neraged warming is consistent with Ganopolski and\nRoche (2009), who simulated \u223c1 \u25e6C and 2 \u25e6C warm-\ning for hosing fluxes of 0.15 and 0.2 Sv respectively,\nalthough our ensemble design (varying 26 parameters\nsimultaneously) does not facilitate a direct compari-\nson with the qualitative differences which arise under\ndifferent hosing assumptions due to increased \u201cwarm-\nclimate\u201d AMOC stability in their model (c.f. Ganopol-\nski and Rahmstorf, 2001). The ensemble distribution\nof simulated warming does not appear sufficient to re-\nproduce observations alone, although the tail of the dis-\ntribution does encompass observations. We again note\nthat absolute temperatures in Antarctica at this time\n(in all three GENIE-1 ensembles) may be understated\ndue to diffusive heat transport that is driven by cool-\ning due to Northern Hemisphere ice sheets in GENIE-1.\nThe removal of WAIS increases ensemble-average East\nAntarctic temperature to 1.6\u00b1 1.3 \u25e6C above preindus-\ntrial. Thus, the inclusion of this feedback (even assum-\ning the extreme of complete WAIS retreat) initially ap-\npears barely sufficient to explain East Antarctic warmth\nClim.

The HadCM3 hos-\ning experiment (assuming modern WAIS) simulated\nprecipitation-weighted temperatures in East Antarctica\nthat are \u223c2 \u25e6C warmer than preindustrial, consistent\nwith GENIE-1 and likely insufficient to reconcile with\nobservations alone. We note that although maximum\nwarming is achieved after \u223c100 years in this experi-\nment (1 Sv hosing is applied throughout the 200 year\nsimulation), CCSM3 hosing experiments in the LGM\nstate indicated that warming in Antarctica shows the\nstrongest relationship with the duration of the forcing\nrather than either rate or total volume of freshwater\n(Otto-Bliesner and Brady, 2010), so the possibility of\nadditional simulated warming under prolonged hosing\ncannot be ruled out. Furthermore, the 200 year integra-\ntion neglects the transport of orbitally-driven warming\nof North Atlantic Deep Water to Circumpolar Deep Wa-\nter (Duplessy et al., 2007) so that the simulated Antarc-\ntic temperature represents a lower bound. Cognisant\nof aforementioned uncertainties, the full reconciliation\nof HadCM3 with observations can be achieved under\nthe assumption of WAIS retreat, with complete retreat\nproducing precipitation-weighted temperature at both\nice core sites (\u223c5 \u25e6C above preindustrial) that exceeds\nthe generally accepted observed warming. The combi-\nnation of extensive temporal and parametric investiga-\ntions in GENIE-1 with detailed short-term integrations\nof HadCM3, and the agreement between the two mod-\nels, substantially strengthens the conclusions that can be\ndrawn from the experiments.\n5 Summary and conclusions\nIn summary we have shown that GENIE-1 reproduces the\ntemperature over Antarctica over the last 800 kyrs in a satis-\nfactory way, with the notable exception of the last four inter-\nglacial periods. The three experiments we have performed,\nwith GENIE-1 and HadCM3, together enable us to postu-\nlate that by including processes represented in both models\nand accounting for the statistical distribution of responses\nwe could explain both the timing and magnitude of obser-\nvations through the introduction of meltwater forcing during\nterminations, likely amplified by feedbacks resulting from\nWAIS retreat, though at present we are not able to achieve\nthis in a single model. Although the tails of both meltwater-\nforced ensemble distributions (EFW and EWAIS) encompass\nobserved WPT warming, reconciliation of data and mod-\nelling can only be readily achieved under the assumption\nof WAIS retreat. The combination of freshwater hosing and\nWAIS forcing produces precipitation-weighted temperatures\n\u223c5 \u25e6C above preindustrial in HadCM3. This warming arises\nfrom the combined effects of increased East Antarctic tem-\nperature and summer precipitation. We do not conclude that\ncomplete WAIS retreat is necessary to explain the model-data\ndiscrepancy, but have applied the extreme boundary condi-\ntions of modern and absent WAIS to span the possible range\nof the forcing associated with this feedback. We are not\naware of other potential feedbacks that might explain \u223c4 \u25e6C\nwarming across East Antarctica.\nOur simulations neglect possible convection feedbacks\ndriven by WAIS meltwater which would be expected to re-\nduce Antarctic temperature. The magnitude of this neglected\nfeedback (\u223c0.5 \u25e6C reduction in Antarctic SAT, c.f. Swinge-\ndouw et al., 2009) compares to ensemble-averaged Antarctic\nbipolar warming of 1.6\u00b1 1.0 \u25e6C (assuming no WAIS retreat).\nWe note that the full magnitude of this feedback would im-\nply a significant loss of WAIS ice. Assuming WAIS retreat\nwould have occurred late in the termination, a feedback of\nthis magnitude would not be inconsistent with \u201ccooling re-\nbounds\u201d that are observed during the later stages of recent\nterminations (Cortese et al., 2007), though we note the pos-\nsibility that such cooling events could alternatively be ex-\nplained as a consequence of the reorganisation of the ocean\ncirculation after the cessation of meltwater.\nSeveral other points in the DOME F record are sugges-\ntive of a meltwater-forced bipolar signal, in particular the\nthree anomalously warm interstadials which were apparently\ncooler at DOME C. During the previous three terminations,\nthe bipolar seesaw would have warmed Antarctica through-\nout the deglaciation, with WAIS retreat occurring at some\npoint, presumably late in the termination as interglacial con-\nditions were approached. In contrast, the resumption of over-\nturning during the B\u00f8lling-Aller\u00f8d\/ACR cooled Antarctica\ntowards the end of TI, potentially preventing further south-\nern warming through stabilisation of the WAIS.\nAcknowledgements.
