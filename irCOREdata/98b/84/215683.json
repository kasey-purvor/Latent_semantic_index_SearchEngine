Due to the widespread deployment of cable in Canada, most major Canadian \ncities have broadband access; Statistics Canada data for 2003 indicates that 86% of \nCanadians have access to broadband services, although certainly a lesser portion actually \nsubscribes.3  As in American cities, Canadian cities have seen many private Wi-Fi \nventures whose objectives are to provide wireless connectivity in commercial \nestablishments, but there have also been several notable municipal ventures like the Fred \neZone in Fredericton, New Brunswick.   \n \nUrban community Wi-Fi in Canada is at a nascent stage; active non-profit groups \ninclude the BC Wireless Network Society in the province of British Columbia and \u00cele \nSans Fil (\u201cWireless Island\u201d) in Montreal, as well as a newly-formed group called, \n\u201cWirelessToronto,\u201d and several smaller projects in Charlottetown, Hamilton, and \nWinnipeg.  These groups support, through dedicated volunteers, the development or \ndeployment of Wi-Fi services in community spaces throughout their regions.  In some  \n*Corresponding author. \nE-mail address: lshade@alcor.concordia.ca (L. R. Shade). \n \n  3 \n \ncases, the groups also develop and refine software intended to help local communities \ncreate and display art and local content over Wi-Fi networks.  Community Wi-Fi, \ntherefore, has the potential to support communities economically, socially, and culturally.  \nThis potential has encouraged comparisons between community Wi-Fi groups and other \nforms of community networking.  While there are certainly some similarities between \ncommunity Wi-Fi groups and other community ICT ventures in Canada, there are also \nclear differences. \nThis paper first presents a brief discussion of various WiFi networking models \nand the current state of Canadian spectrum policy.  Some contextual information about \nCanadian community networks in Canada is given, with a brief overview of Canadian \nICT initiatives, policies, and programs.  The paper then explores how Wi-Fi development \nand innovation is occurring within urban Canadian communities, both as part of \nmunicipal government projects and as part of grassroots community technology \ninitiatives, with a focused discussion of Montreal\u2019s \u00cele Sans Fil, a community wireless \nnetwork.  The paper concludes with a reflection on the relationships between community \nWi-Fi and other forms of community networking, as well as the potential policy \nchallenges raised by community wireless Internet development. \n \nMethods  \nThe case study portion of this paper is the result of a year-long participatory \nresearch project with the wireless community group \u00cele Sans Fil, as part of the Canadian \nResearch Alliance for Community Innovation and Networking (CRACIN) research \nproject on community networking.4  Participatory research methods are widely used in \n  4 \n \nthe study of community or grassroots networking projects (see 5 for a review of \napproaches and 6 and 7 for examples in practice).  These methods explicitly involve \ncommunity members in the design and interpretation of research.  Research results are \nintended to benefit community members as well as academics.  In this project, one of the \nauthors worked closely with the members of ISF to design and conduct surveys of their \nusers, some of which were deployed by student interns.  She was also granted access to \nthe group\u2019s user logs.  These quantitative methods were augmented by qualitative \nmethods, including interviews with members of ISF\u2019s board of directors, attendance at \ntwice-monthly public meetings, and monitoring of online public mailing lists.  Research \nresults were communicated to ISF board members to assist in strategic planning.   \n \nNetworking wireless technologies  \nWireless Internet technologies are increasingly being adopted by community and \nmunicipal groups as inexpensive ways to extend broadband Internet to citizens.  Wireless \nsystems either use licensed parts of the radio spectrum or they transmit signals over the \nlicense exempt portions of the radio spectrum at 2.4 GHz.  A large number of devices, \nincluding garage door openers and commercial wireless equipment, operate using this \nportion of spectrum.  High-powered transmission using licensed radio spectrum is often \ncalled \u201cfixed wireless\u201d because signal transmitters are fixed in place.  These systems \noperate on spectrum that is licensed for a particular use and often require specialized \nreceivers for users.  Open wireless, which operates on license-exempt radio spectrum, has \na much lower signal strength than fixed wireless, and as the license-exempt band fills up, \ntransmission speeds can diminish.  However, open wireless has become increasingly \n  5 \n \npopular as a last-mile solution for homes and neighborhoods because there is no license \nfee for the radio spectrum and because all commercial systems use the same standard for \nwireless transmission, so devices are easily interoperable.  While there are numerous \npotential technical configurations for wireless Internet projects, municipal and \ncommunity projects tend to organize their networks in one of three ways: as a series of \nindependent or linked hotspots, as a hub-and-spoke system, or as a dynamic mesh.  The \nchoice to use one type of networking model over another depends upon the technical, \nsocial, and economic capacity in any particular local area. \nNetworking Models \n1. Hotspots (also called access points): These are points at which broadband Internet \nsignals are broadcast wirelessly to the immediate geographical area.  Coverage \nnormally extends about three hundred meters from the source signal, although more \ncoverage is possible using exterior antennae.  Community Wi-Fi groups \u00cele Sans Fil \nand WirelessToronto use hotspots to provide a simple way for local businesses and \norganizations to share bandwidth, and as methods of displaying local art and \nencouraging the development of local community content production. \n \n2. Hub-and-spoke systems: In isolated areas, a single high-powered antenna can \nbroadcast a signal from, for example, a hill to the homes of the valley below.  Hub-\nand-spoke systems are often used in fixed wireless installations where wireless is used \nto disseminate a signal in areas where fiber-optic cable cannot be laid due to \ngeographic or economic limitations.  The municipal Fredericton Fred eZone is a \ncollection of hubs and spokes connected to high-powered backhaul bandwidth.  These \n  6 \n \nsystems function best when the community has the ability to purchase and distribute \nadequate bandwidth. \n3. Dynamic mesh: Interconnected nodes in a neighborhood share bandwidth drawn from \na high-capacity backbone in this type of configuration.  Each of the nodes can \ncommunicate with the Internet as well as with each of the other nodes, providing the \npossibility for creating robust local area networks.  Deploying mesh networks \nnecessitates a certain number of individuals or organizations that are willing to share \ntheir Internet backbone.  When mesh networks function well, communication between \nnodes is as important as communication with the Internet.  The most robust and \nflexible software for developing community mesh networks has been produced by \nCUWin, the Champaign-Urbana community wireless network \n(http:\/\/www.cuwireless.net\/).  BCWireless has experimented with mesh networks, \nalthough they do not have a stable provider for their Internet backbone, which means \nthat their systems primarily connect nodes to one another, as opposed to connecting \nmany people to the Internet. \nIn Canada, most community wireless projects concentrate on creating wireless \nhotspots, while municipal projects use hub-and-spoke systems and sometimes (although \nrarely) mesh systems.  It remains to be seen exactly how wireless mesh networks will be \ndeployed, although they have so far been successfully adopted in US municipalities and \nin the developing world.8  9 \nCanadian wireless policy \nCanada\u2019s spectrum policy is established by the Ministry of Industry under the \nRadiocommunication Act and the Department of Industry Act.  Domestic spectrum \n  7 \n \npolicy is set out in the Telecommunications Act and in coordination with other countries \nand international bodies.  Canada has provided spectrum for wireless broadband in \nseveral frequency bands with plans to create additional spectrum.  The 2500 MHz band is \ncurrently licensed for Multipoint Distribution System (MDS) and for wireless Internet \nMultipoint Communication System (MCS) services.  In the 2001 public consultation on \nopening the 3500 MHz band for Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) and Wireless \nCommunications Services (WCS) in the 2300 MHz range, Industry Canada allowed that \nup to 200 MHz for FWA and 30 MHz for WCS could be opened in the 3500 MHz band.  \nIndustry Canada is currently undertaking a review of the use of spectrum in the 3 \nto 30 GHz range, which could allow for more wireless broadband access.  The May 2005 \nConsultation on a Renewed Spectrum Policy Framework for Canada and Continued \nAdvancements in Spectrum Management contains a set of core objectives and policy \nguidelines for public consultation in modernizing Canada\u2019s spectrum program.  Four \nbroad themes for policy development have been identified: 1) facilitating access to \nspectrum, 2) providing spectrum availability for priority requirements and societal needs, \n3) improving the utilization of spectrum resources, and 4) delivering the Canadian \nSpectrum Management Program.  Industry Canada\u2019s intent is to also facilitate access to \nspectrum for licensed and license-exempt application; give priority to spectrum usage for \nnational security and public safety needs; provide a degree of international \nharmonization; and allow for flexibility in the application of frequency allocations.10 \nIndustry Canada is also conducting a Telecommunications Policy Review, the \nmandate of which is to review Canada's telecommunications policy and regulatory \nframework.  The Panel will provide recommendations \u201con how to move Canada toward a \n  8 \n \nmodern telecommunications framework in a manner that benefits Canadian industry and \nconsumers.\u201d11   [If you could paraphrase this, it would eliminate the need to enter a page \nnumber or an explanation that this was an online source.]Technological developments \nthat have created a more challenging policy environment include shifts to IP-based \ntechnologies, the deployment of fiber-optic technologies, and the increasing prevalence \nof wireless technologies.  Commenting on the 802.11 Wi-Fi standard, the Panel noted \nthat this rapid use \u201cmay already be having an impact on the revenues of the licensed \nwireless providers, in particular on data revenues.\u201d 11   [If you could paraphrase this, it \nwould eliminate the need to enter a page number or an explanation that this was an online \nsource.] \nGiven these ongoing telecommunication reforms, several aspects of community \nwireless developments require policy attention, particularly with regard to a possible \nreform of spectrum allocation policy.  Most community wireless projects use the license-\nexempt section of the radio spectrum, at 2.4GHz.  As time passes and more and more \ndevices use this section of the spectrum, interference will undoubtedly increase and data \ntransfer will become more difficult.  Policy-makers need to be aware that providing more \nunlicensed spectrum may not only provide more affordable \u201clast mile\u201d communications \npotential but could also expand the ability for community groups like \u00cele Sans Fil to \ndevelop creative local applications.  Policies which promote the opening of more \nunlicensed or license-exempt spectrum, or which help to prioritize signals sharing the \ncurrently license-exempt spectrum, would permit communities to choose the manner in \nwhich they distributed or shared their Internet signals.  This would ensure that policies \n  9 \n \nbenefit not just industry and commercial interests but also local communities and the \npublic interest.  \nContext: Canadian community networks, past and present \nWhat differentiates the early community networks of the 1990s from the Wi-Fi \ncommunity networks of today is that for many community members, community \nnetworks were the only tangible way for them to connect to the Internet.  Pre-Web, the \nInternet was relegated to those in academia, the high-tech industry, or the military.  \nInternet Service Providers did not become prevalent until the mid-1990s, and their \neventual concentration into a few major service providers occurred only the late 1990s.  \nTherefore, community networks in Canada represented for many a powerful \nmodel for enabling citizens to support and sustain community (both geographically based \nand \u201cvirtual\u201d), to access and contribute to local community content, and to reinforce \nnational identity.  As a community owned and controlled service, community networks \nemphasized the posting of local resources, services, and culture.  In Canada, at their high \npoint between 1995-96, there were 35 operating community networks across the country, \nwith between 250,000 and 600,000 members.12  They were concerned with ensuring \nuniversal access to the network free of charge or with a very nominal cost to all members \nof the community.  Schools, libraries, recreational centers, and shopping malls often \nserved as the public access points.  Proponents of community nets also believed that they \ncould contribute to community development and strengthen and revitalize communities \nthrough positive and interactive communication between residents and local institutions.  \nCanada\u2019s telecom regulator, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications \n  10 \n \nCommission (CRTC), also recognized the value of community nets by recognizing their \nrole in supporting Canadian content, network literacy, and universal access.13 \nHowever, with the rapid diffusion of the Internet into the academy, workplaces, \nand homes, the original impetus of community networks \u2013 to provide access to the \nInternet at no cost, especially to those who would not otherwise have access \u2013 has waned, \nand community networks face challenges in maintaining members and creating and \nsustaining locally relevant content.  This is not to say that community networks are \nobsolete; Canada\u2019s federal \u201cConnecting Canadians\u201d agenda, launched in 1995, held as a \ncentral goal making Canada \u201cthe most \u2018connected nation on earth.\u2019\u201d[We will need a \nsource and page number for this \u2013 if you cannot paraphrase.]  Led by Industry Canada, \nthe Connectedness agenda included such programs as SchoolNet, the Community Access \nProgram (CAP), VolNet, LibraryNet, and Smart Communities programs.  Other recent \nfederal and provincial programs have pursued related goals (e.g., Industry Canada\u2019s \nBroadband for Rural and Northern Development (BRAND); the National Satellite \nInitiative (NSI); Human Resource and Skills Development Canada\u2019s Community \nLearning Networks; Government On-line; and the SuperNet project in Alberta.14  \nAs CRACIN noted in its first round submission to the Telecommunications Policy \nReview Panel, the sustainability of community networking organizations has been \nexacerbated by a variety of institutional and organizational factors.  Government-funded \naccess initiatives have created complex and frustrating accountability and reporting \nmechanisms, budgeting cycles have complicated long-term program planning and staff \nallocation, and \u201cthe \u2018sustainability\u2019 of public access to the internet has been defined \nrather narrowly in terms of a project\u2019s ability to cover its own costs.  This focus on \n  11 \n \neconomic sustainability over community capacity building threatens to undermine rural \nand remote broadband access.\u201d15  [Is it possible to paraphrase this?  I do have a question \nregarding this footnote \u2013 please see the footnote section.] \nCRACIN also pointed out the recent vulnerability of community networking \ngroups, with the closure of over 2000 Community Access sites in the last few years and \nthe suggestion from Industry Canada that at least one third of remaining CAP sites \n\u201cwould reduce service or close altogether without continued government funding.\u201d  [Is \nthis an online source only?]CRACIN recommended that: \nConnectivity policy and programs should be designed and implemented  \nwith a strong community-based component in mind.  This means not only  \nbetter funding for community-based ICT initiatives, but involving communities  \nand community organizations in connectivity policy making, defining access  \nneeds, designing programs, etc.16 [Is this an online source only?  If so, we can just \nnote that there are no page numbers.  If it has a paper source, we may need the page \nnumbers.] \nCanadian municipal Wi-Fi ventures \nWi-Fi seems to offer a potential technical fix to these connectivity problems, \nwhich has led to its adoption in municipal and community contexts.  Several \nmunicipalities in Canada have explored deploying Wi-Fi for community economic \ndevelopment \u2013 for both business and tourist applications, and for municipal policing and \nother services \u2013 such as remote monitoring of parking meters and the automation of other \nservices.  Many municipal Wi-Fi projects are the result of private-public partnerships \n  12 \n \n(P3) where private companies receive a license to distribute wireless Internet signals to \ncitizens.   \nFor example, Calgary\u2019s Wireless City initiative, funded by the Province of \nAlberta, the City of Calgary, the federal government, and private initiatives such as Cisco \nand Fringe Solutions Inc., has created four separate access zones in downtown Calgary \n(see https:\/\/www.wirelesscity.ca\/).  The city of Hamilton, Ontario, is testing whether Wi-\nFi can interact with the deployment of utility smart meters that are being installed in \nhomes and businesses in the next year.  This move is propelled by the mandate from the \nGovernment of Ontario that 800,000 smart meters be implemented by the end of 2007.  \nUtility companies would thus like to be able to seamlessly send and receive date related \nto billing and load-management.  Hamilton Utilities uses a Fibrewired affiliate that \nalready has a municipal-wide fiber-optic network that can be easily connected to Wi-Fi \nstations.18 \nPerhaps one of the most successful municipal Wi-Fi endeavors is Fredericton \nNew Brunswick\u2019s Fred eZone, a free municipal Wi-Fi infrastructure initiated in 2003.  \nFred eZone\u2019s coverage includes the downtown business district, municipal parks, local \narenas, business hotels, Kings Place Mall, and the Fredericton Mall.  Eventually, it is \nanticipated that Fred-eZone will encompass all of Fredericton\u2019s business corridors and \npublic spaces.  Fredericton is a small (population 80,000) yet vital eastern city hosting \ntwo universities, a burgeoning high tech sector, and government: the provincial capital \nand several federal government offices are located there (see http:\/\/www.fred-ezone.ca\/).  \nAs a \u201csmart community\u201d19 whose mandate is to provide low-cost, high-speed \nInternet access to its citizens, Fredericton faced a duopolistic broadband market which \n  13 \n \ncompelled municipal leaders to set up their own non-profit company to become a non-\ndominant carrier.  In 1999, the government invested in a municipal fiber-optic network \nbackbone, but it took until 2001 before an appropriate last-mile solution (in this case \nwireless) was found.  E-Novations is a not-for-profit municipally owned corporation \nlicensed as a CRTC non-dominant carrier.  Local business and universities support its co-\nop model.  The 22km fiber-optic community network interconnects partners with each \nother and with the Internet, as well as with community members through Motorola \nCanopy long-distance wireless technology.  This fixed wireless installation broadcasts \nsignals from antennas strategically placed in locations with broadband connectivity.  \nFredericton\u2019s project uses a variety of high-powered transmitters fixed to antennas, \nbridges, and other structures to broadcast strong Internet signals.  However, it is not self-\nhealing, nor does it extend to every neighborhood in the city at this point.   \nThe project\u2019s success can be attributed to its municipal orientation: basic wireless \nsignals are provided to Fredericton\u2019s citizens as part of taxpayer-supported municipal \ninfrastructure.  For residents who want web space, e-mail, or other services, partnerships \nwith local businesses provide these for a cost.  Fredericton\u2019s unique public-private \npartnership has been held up as an example of successful municipal network \ndevelopment, especially now that newly-passed US laws (in Nebraska, for example) \nforbid the development of similar networks in American municipalities. \nSome recent work20 has suggested that municipalities could partner with \ncommunity groups instead of public partners to provide wireless services.  This would \nprovide sustainable funding for community wireless groups while helping municipalities \nprovide universal service and community content.  However, before such partnerships are \n  14 \n \nlaunched, it is important to take stock of the current state of such community initiatives \nand consider the ways in which they might contribute to such partnerships, as well as \ntheir current limitations and the challenges they face.   \nCommunity networks go Wi-Fi  \nCommunity groups working with wireless Internet technologies have sprung up in \nnearly every North American city.  These groups have developed either independently or \nout of existing community networks and have focused on the relatively flexible nature of \ncommercially available Wi-Fi technology \u2013 that is, the interoperability of devices \noperating in license-exempt spectrum.  Open-source software enthusiasts are active in the \ncommunity Wi-Fi movement, attracted by the challenge of developing new \nfunctionalities and expanding connectivity.  Common to all community wireless groups is \nthe desire to keep certain parts of the wireless spectrum unlicensed and to provide free \nand open possibilities for computers to connect with each other and with the Internet.   \nHowever, all community-based wireless groups are not created equal.  The \nobjectives and missions of these organizations vary, from providing a space for \ndiscussion of new technological developments by enthusiasts to creating a mesh network \nof Wi-Fi nodes that would permit the development of an alternative \u2018intranet\u2019 network, \nnot necessarily connected to the Internet.  Some groups dedicate themselves to opening \nhotspots, while others are concerned with the social and community aspects of wireless \ntechnology.   \nThe best-known community wireless groups are Seattle Wireless, CUWin (in \nChampaign-Urbana, Illiniois), NYCWireless in New York City, Wireless London (made \nup of several distinct smaller groups), and Paris Sans-Fil.  Many of these groups have \n  15 \n \nbeen working for several years on networks of hotspots, as well as on the development of \nmesh networks.  Recently, some of these groups have moved away from their initial goal \nof primarily providing wireless Internet access towards broader community goals.  For \ninstance, CUWin has recently released software that can easily be used in any context to \ncreate a municipal mesh network (see http:\/\/cuwireless.net\/news), NYCWireless is \nadvocating a citywide deployment of meshed Internet nodes, and members of Wireless \nLondon are experimenting with location-aware mapping and content development (see \nhttp:\/\/wirelesslondon.info\/LondonNodeMap?v=15kb).  \nSimilar to the first community networking experiments in the early 1990s21, the \ninterests of wireless groups depend on the interests and ideals of their mostly voluntary \nmembers.  Groups tend to be loosely organized, decentralized, and somewhat anarchic in \ntheir approach.  Many of them are informal, quasi-social groups of technology \nprofessionals and interested amateurs.  These factors contribute to the heterogeneity of \nthese groups and may influence the choice of technically focused primary missions.  \nSandvig22 argues that the primary missions of North American and European wireless \ncommunity groups do not necessarily offer significant challenges to dominant \ntelecommunications policy or delivery mechanisms, depending as they do on ethics of \n\u201caccidental sharing.\u201d  However, as wireless technology becomes more ubiquitous, and as \nprivate companies and municipalities develop high-level, and potentially expensive \nwireless Internet services, wireless groups can potentially contribute something other \nthan frameworks for sharing signals: a community focus that could permit the \ndevelopment of local content and civic participation. \n  16 \n \nComing after the more established North American Wi-Fi projects, Canadian \nwireless projects are considered to be the \u201csecond wave\u201d of community wireless \ninnovation.  Aware of achievements of more established groups in the United States and \nEurope through their participation in conferences and online forums, Canadian \ncommunity wireless groups are adopting goals that speak to a range of issues beyond \nsimple wireless access.  Many groups, including \u00cele Sans Fil, hold as primary goals the \npromotion of free wireless Internet in their local areas.  Secondary goals, like \u201cpromoting \nlocal community\u201d23 or \u201cdeveloping appropriate technology,\u201d24 [If these don\u2019t appear in \npaper versions, I think we can just indicate that these are online sources and eliminate the \nneed for page numbers.  However, paraphrasing may make it clearer to typesetters at the \npublisher.] may accompany these primary goals.  However, while they share some \ncharacteristics with the previous generation of community networks,25 they do not, as the \nearly free-nets did, necessarily explicitly aim to address the digital divide or to promote \nlocal communities through the provision of locally produced community content.  \n \nBCWireless British Columbia, Canada (www.bcwireless.net)  \nBC Wireless (BCW), established in 2000, experiments with wireless \ninfrastructure in order to provide the infrastructure to the greatest number of people \npossible.  Their explicit goal is to build digital communities at the local level, not to \nprovide Internet access.  Many of their projects are thus oriented towards developing and \ndeepening mesh networks, especially for use in rural and remote communities.  Their \nvolunteer-run group requires participating members to set up a mesh access points and \nnetwork them with others.  However, the group collaborates with other community \n  17 \n \ngroups and for-profit providers to deploy technologies that will be useful in local settings, \nincluding Internet services.  They also coordinate the Community Hotspot Program, \nwhich uses Wi-Fi software developed by volunteers at Montreal\u2019s \u00eele sans Fil, to open \ncentrally managed hotspots with unique visual identities.  The group has recently \ndeveloped a prioritization of users to determine who will be permitted Internet access \nover BCWireless mesh networks, considering that Internet access over the network is \ndonated by volunteers.  Those who own the nodes will be permitted Internet access, while \nactive BCW participants will be allowed access on a discretionary basis.  Users with \nBCW accounts who do not contribute will be allowed to interact with the local \ncommunity but not to access the wider Internet resources.  This provides a metrics of \ntrust in which those who contribute to the project should be more trusted than those who \nsolely create usernames.  However, it does create another level of control on the Internet, \nand defines a very specific \u201ccommunity\u201d of users. \n \nWirelessToronto (www.wirelesstoronto.ca) \n This group has just begun to organize and to \u201cunwire\u201d Toronto locations.  \nAccording to their website, they hold as goals, \u201clowering the barrier for entry into the \nunwired networking world and exploring how wireless internet can be used to build \ncommunity.\u201d  They will provide Internet access free of charge in public and \u201csemi-\npublic\u201d places.  The group is deciding how to use technology as well as how to define \ncommunity.  For the moment, they have begun their work using the hotspot model \nborrowed from \u00cele Sans Fil, including the Wifi Dog software and its interface.  Their first \n  18 \n \nhotspots are hosted by arts organizations such as the 215 Centre for Social Innovation, \nand they hope to continue to work with the cultural sector.   \nAll of Canada\u2019s community wireless groups attempt to respond to their specific \nlocal circumstances.  In some ways, these groups hold some of the core values of \ncommunity networks, as outlined by Schuler26: information and communication; \nconviviality and culture; education; strong democracy; health and well-being; and \neconomic equity, opportunity, and sustainability.  At the same time, though, community \nwireless networks are a product of a specific socio-technical moment; in Canada, \ncomputing and Internet access are becoming more and more ubiquitous, while \ngovernment-funded Canadian public Internet access is suffering from a withdrawal of \npublic funding.27  In this unique and evolving context, community wireless initiatives can \nplay a variety of roles.  Montreal\u2019s \u00cele Sans Fil is a good example of how local forces \ntemper the mix between amateur technical experimentation community content \ndevelopment and local engagement.  \n \n\u00cele Sans Fil (http:\/\/www.ilesansfil.org) \n\u00cele Sans Fil (ISF) is arguably Canada\u2019s most successful community wireless \nnetwork: at the time of writing, the group had installed 60 wireless hotspots, and over \n10,000 people had created user accounts.  A completely volunteer-run initiative, ISF has \nbecome the dominant provider of wireless access points while growing as an important \npart of Montreal\u2019s community-based media community.  To illustrate, in March 2005, \nISF received the Montreal Prix d\u2019Innovation Sociale for its contributions to the social use \n  19 \n \nof information technology, and in May 2005, they were voted one of the five best Internet \nservice providers by the Mirror independent weekly newspaper. \nISF not only provides free Internet access in public places but also creates the \nmeans for local community content and new media art to reach new audiences.  ISF \ndiffers from other community wireless groups in two ways: their primary stated goal \nspecifies \u201cthe deployment of numerous free Internet hotspots in public spaces (cafes, \nparks, etcs.).\u201d28 [Is \u201cects.\u201d spelled this way in the source?  Could this be paraphrased\/] \nThis focus on the Internet as a \u201cpublic\u201d technology \u2013 one that might be suited to free \ndistribution in public spaces \u2013 is a unique point of departure.  ISF\u2019s secondary goal is \nvariously expressed as, \u201cconnecting Montrealers to one another,\u201d \u201ccreating community,\u201d \nor \u201cempowering individuals and fostering a sense of community.\u201d29  The group actively \npursues this goal, and that pursuit has resulted in the creation of specific software that \ndisplays unique content at each hotspot, the drafting of a \u201csocial contract\u201d regulating the \nrelationship between the partners who provide Internet service, and \u00cele Sans Fil, and \nongoing partnerships with arts organizations and libraries.  In addition, ISF continues to \nplan for \u201cthe creation of a high speed rooftop to rooftop wireless network (a mesh \nnetwork) open to everyone in the metropolitan region.\u201d30  \nAs one of the ISF founders writes: \nWe are a group of concerned and motivated citizens taking  \ncontrol of ICT infrastructure in our city.  That's empowering as  \nan example to others that this important part of our life isn't only  \nthe domain of companies and corporations or even governments.   \nTo me, that's a more significant impact than the actual fact that we  \n  20 \n \nhave 55 hotspots and 9000 users.  We are hacking the built city\u2026 \nWhere this gets exciting is that by citizens, artists and non-profit  \ngroups developing and adapting these technologies (portable devices,  \nwireless connectivity, mobile- and location-based applications) and  \ntheir model (who is supposed to use them and for what purpose) we are  \nable to impact and change this enhanced space and through that have an  \nactual impact on how the built city is experienced.31 \n \nLike all community wireless groups, ISF is a product of its location, and of its \nmembers.  In its particular case, these two forces have given rise to a unique contribution \nto local culture. \n \nLocal Culture \nMontreal is a city of two million people located on the St-Lawrence seaway in \ncentral Canada.  It is historically bilingual (French and English) and increasingly \nmulticultural32 (32), facts which are reflected in the makeup of ISF, which is officially \nbilingual.  All meetings are held in both (or either) French and English, as members \nchoose to speak in the language in which they are most comfortable.  Montreal\u2019s climate \nis one of extremes, with long, dark, snowy winters and hot humid summers.  As a result, \nthe city still hosts a vibrant \u201ccaf\u00e9 culture\u201d where cafes, restaurants, and bars act as \nimportant \u201cthird places\u201d33 [Since this is a reference to a print source, we will need page \nnumbers for these phrase quotes (\u201ccaf\u00e9 culture\u201d and \u201cthird places\u201d)], especially during \nthe winter.  Not surprisingly for a city with four universities and numerous colleges, \n  21 \n \nMontreal has a large student population, and its high social quality of life34, combined \nwith the fact that it is one of the least expensive major cities in the world35, have made it \nattractive for freelance workers.  \nThese factors may contribute to the popularity of ISF\u2019s hotspots.  In fact, before \nISF began their installations, the public locations equipped with wireless were limited to \ndowntown hotels and university campuses.  Students and professionals who wanted \npublic Internet access were thus drawn to ISF, as were activists committed to the \ndevelopment of a \u201cpublic internet.\u201d[Is this phrase widespread enough that we could \neliminate the quotation marks?]  The core membership of ISF is made up of technology \nworkers, freelance consultants (including programmers, graphic designers, and \ncommunity technology consultants), students (of urban studies, sociology, and \ncommunications), community activists, and artists.  Members join for a variety of \nreasons, but a member survey36 indicates that most enjoy the convivial, social nature of \nthe volunteer group. \nISF\u2019s unique features, such as its provision of multimedia art, may also be a \nconsequence of its location in Montreal.  The Quebec government arts subsidies are \ngenerous compared to those in other Canadian provinces, allowing many artists to live in \nMontreal.  However, multimedia artists struggle to find exhibition space.  A unique \npartnership between ISF and the Mobile Digital Commons Network (MDCN)37,  a large-\nscale arts research project funded by Canadian Heritage to explore the artistic \npossibilities of mobile communication technologies in urban cultures, has financially \nsupported the development of specific software functionalities that have permitted artists \nto exhibit their work on the portal pages of each hotspot.  One of the most unique works \n  22 \n \nwas the \u201cPattern Language\u201d project (see screen shot in Appendix One). [Are you \nreferring to Figure 2?] In this project, each hotspot is associated with a particular \ncharacter in novella.  As an ISF subscriber logs on at each individual hotspot, one \nsentence is added to a customized version of the novella.  Therefore, a user who visits \nmany different hotspots will read a story from many different perspectives, and a user \nwho accesses the service from one location will eventually construct the story from a \nsingle point of view.  Thus far, this financial support from MDCN is the only major \npublic funding ISF has received.   \nIn short, local factors have been instrumental in leading ISF to its current success, \nwhere it has not only provided sixty hotspots but also covered two major thoroughfares (a \ncentral shopping, entertainment, and restaurant district, and a historic square) with \nwireless signals and extended service far outside of the central areas covered by the \ntelecom companies.  However, its success has also depended on the involvement of local \nbusiness and community partners. \n \nCommunity partnerships \nLocal support by businesses and organizations for ISF has been enthusiastic.  \nMontreal, and Quebec in general, were not well served by early commercial wireless \nInternet installations.  Thus, businesses that wanted to offer wireless Internet to their \ncustomers were intrigued by ISF\u2019s service, especially after media coverage portrayed \npartnerships with ISF as progressive and community-oriented.38  Furthermore, Quebec \nhas had a long tradition of community media and of integration of ICTs into the \ncommunity sector.39  40  Partnering with a community group provides businesses and \n  23 \n \nnon-profits with a sense of having positively contributed to their community while \nproviding a useful service.  In addition, some of ISF\u2019s installations have helped other \ncommunity organizations to lower their Internet connection costs by wirelessly sharing a \nsingle connection.   \n ISF works closely with Communautique, a Quebec-wide, non-profit umbrella \norganization dedicated to bridging digital divides and providing community organizations \nwith appropriate technologies.41  This group is also active in lobbying for community-\nbased media and public communications infrastructure.  Communautique, along with \nother Montreal non-profit groups, is encouraging ISF to continue to develop their mesh \nnetworking project, which would permit community groups to exchange information with \none another as well as to potentially gain wireless access to commonly-owned Internet \nbandwidth.  \n In order for a wireless mesh network to be developed that would satisfy the \ndesires of the community sector, a reliable and plentiful supply of bandwidth would need \nto be secured, either through co-operative purchase from a wholesaler or an agreement \nwith the municipality, a university, or some other reliable source of bandwidth.  In \nMontreal, in contrast to Fredericton and Champaign-Urbana, neither the municipality nor \nany of the city\u2019s four universities (which each have their own closed wireless networks) \nhave expressed interest in providing bandwidth to be shared by the community at large.  \nThis means that a mesh project would have to be supported by the community sector \nitself.  This is still a long-term goal requiring negotiation with many different \nstakeholders.  In the meantime, ISF is concentrating on delivering the services they do \n  24 \n \nprovide to businesses and community groups and preventing the burnout of their core \nvolunteers.    \n \nServices provided by Ile Sans Fil \nISF is not an Internet service provider.  As part of its central mandate to extend \nwireless Internet and build communities, the group provides software, hardware, and \ntechnical support to people and organizations who want to share their Internet signal.  \nThe software (which is produced and distributed by ISF) simultaneously creates a \nplatform for wireless access that promotes community development while managing and \ntracking users of the service.  The software, called Wifi Dog, is programmed through a \n\u201chack\u201d onto a commercial wireless modem.  ISF provides these routers to hotspot hosts \nfor wholesale cost.  For a yearly donation of fifty dollars, the group installs the router and \nconducts technical support of the hotspot on a volunteer basis.  In exchange, the hotspot \nhost signs a contract promising not to charge for access to wireless Internet services.  \nSome business owner hosts may require users to purchase items in order to stay in their \nlocation, but other hotspots, such as public libraries, arts organizations, and community \ncenters, do not require payment of any type to use wireless services facilitated by ISF.  \nThe social contract, which guarantees that no end user will ever have to pay directly for \nwireless Internet service at an ISF hotspot, and formally defines the hotspot host as a \npartner, is a formal declaration of ISF\u2019s secondary goals.  These goals are also expressed \nin the technical development of the Wifi Dog software. \n \n \n  25 \n \nTechnical development \nThe Wifi Dog software serves two purposes: it is the local management utility for \nan individual access point that features individualized elements within a consistent \u2018\u00cele \nSans Fil\u2019 look, and it also regulates the system as a whole through an authorization \nserver, which also collects aggregate information about usage patterns.  The local \nmanagement software can be installed on a LinkSys WRTg wireless Internet router, and \nthe authorization server needs to be run from a dedicated server.  Wifi Dog permits both \nincreasing specialization of services for users and a reduction of each user\u2019s anonymity.  \nWhen a user registers for an ISF account, he\/she provides a valid e-mail address, which is \nstored in the authorization server and can be used to (at least partially) identify anyone \nwho is abusing the service\u2013 for example, someone who is using too much bandwidth or \nwho has engaged in illegal activities.  At the same time, the authorization server makes it \npossible for users to see the screen names of other people who are online at a specific \nlocation.  This functionality has the promise of permitting unique \u201csocial software\u201d \napplications, where users can post profiles describing themselves or read the profiles of \nothers.  So far, this functionality has not yet been fully developed.  ISF considers that any \ninformation provided in such a profile would be entirely public, and entirely voluntary.  \nWhile the group has no written privacy policy as yet, members have always agreed that \nany retrieval of information about users would only be used for academic purposes, or in \nthe rare case of an abuse of the system. \n Although the authorization server holds the promise of unique computer-mediated \nmethods of local communication, the hotspot hosts seem most enamored with Wifi Dog\u2019s \nother functionality: the possibility for each location to customize its own portal page.  \n  26 \n \nThis creates a place for content created in or about the local area, as well as the \nmultimedia art curated by the Mobile Digital Commons Network.  Currently, these portal \npages can display photographs of the hotspot location, news feeds chosen by the hotspot \nhosts, and at some locations, shared content (photographs, for example) contributed by \nusers (see Appendix 1 for an example of a portal page).  \nISF hopes that these portal pages will become useful virtual clearing-houses of \n\u201cultra-local\u201d information on events, news, politics, and issues of interest to the area \nsurrounding each hotspot.  According to a questionnaire distributed to ISF users in April \n2005, a majority of people would like to see this type of information available at \nhotspots.42  Providing this type of information would involve ISF in the kind of local \ncontent creation facilitated by the original community networks active in Canada in the \n1990s.  However, as at community networks, the uses of ISF services points out the \ndelicate balance between access to local information and access to globally networked \nservices and the Internet. \n \nUses and users \nCurrently, over 10,000 people have active ISF accounts, and internal logs indicate \nthat just over 8,000 individuals have accessed the Internet using ISF\u2019s services.  In order \nto use the services at an ISF hotspot, a user must either possess a wireless-equipped \ndevice or visit one of two locations that provide desktop computers.  As a result, most of \nISF\u2019s users tend to be people who already have access to mobile computing technology, \nas well as interest in new technology.  One might consider these members to be a \ntechnical elite: well educated, interested in, and adept with new technology.  A November \n  27 \n \n2004 online survey indicated that the most active and engaged sub-section of ISF users \nwere bilingual males between the ages of 18 and 30 who were studying or working in the \ntechnology field.43  A more detailed questionnaire distributed in-person to users at nine \ndifferent hotspots in April 2005 confirmed the trend of youthful users: the vast majority \nof respondents were between 18 and 30 and either students or professionals of some sort.  \n(see charts in Appendix 2 for a breakdown of surveyed users by gender, age, occupation, \nand primary use of services). [Please list the specific Figures to which you are referring.]  \nAll of the respondents said they had Internet access at other locations, including school, \nlibraries, and other public locations, suggesting that Internet access at a wireless hotspot \nacts as only one of \u201ca constellation of internet access locations\u201d [May we eliminate the \nquotation marks in this phrase?] that make up the ubiquitous Internet access that many \nurban residents have come to take for granted.44  Given that a wireless hotspot is only one \namong many Internet access locations, will community information be accessed as \nfrequently as the information provided at home by the original community networks? \nResults of the survey indicate that email and web-based information searching are \nthe most common activities at hotspots, although some users also admit using the service \nfor paid work.  Canada\u2019s national newspaper, The Globe and Mail, recently reported that \nfreelance workers in Montreal are increasingly expecting to have wireless access in bars \nand restaurants.45  The \u201ctechnical elite\u201d[May we eliminate the quotation marks in this \nphrase?] who seem to make up ISF\u2019s core membership are considered to be valuable \nclients for caf\u00e9 owners: a caf\u00e9 owner is quoted as saying, \u201cPeople do their meetings here, \nand there are a ton of freelancers who use the Internet here instead of at home . . . \nsomeone with a laptop has a little more money to spend.\"46   \n  28 \n \nIt would seem that ISF\u2019s services primarily benefit freelance workers and \nstudents.  Analysis of the authorization server logs reveals that the most popular hotspots \nare downtown caf\u00e9s where both food and alcohol are served, and that these locations are \nbusiest in the early afternoon, midweek.  The most popular hotspot receives over 25 \nunique visits per day, and several other hotspots receive over ten unique visits each day.  \nClearly, the service is popular and well used, and provides benefits to the businesses that \npartner with ISF.  But what about the role of community content? Because this feature is \nnot yet fully developed, it is difficult to say how useful users consider it.  However, the \nmost recent user survey revealed that two thirds of users would like to see local \ncommunity news.  The majority of respondents also indicated that, besides the fact that \nthe service was free of charge, they enjoyed using a wireless service that was provided by \na non-profit community group, an observation in line with Meinrath,47 who noticed that \nusers of the CUWin network described themselves as proud to be associated with a \ncommunity endeavor.  For ISF, though, the tensions between expectations of \nprofessional-quality service by the business owners and technical workers who use their \nservices most heavily, and the further development of community-based content \nfunctions must be balanced considering their limited volunteer resources.   \n \nSustainability \nLike all volunteer-based groups, ISF must worry about long-term sustainability.  \nThe organization is worried that over time their core volunteers will eventually be unable \nto take on the responsibilities of deploying and servicing a larger number of hotspots.  \nThis issue is even more pronounced for a group which aims to provide a specific \n  29 \n \ntelecommunications service like free public wireless Internet when technological \ndevelopments make it likely that cities like Montreal will soon be covered with \nubiquitous wireless internet signals (see \nhttp:\/\/www.cwta.ca\/CWTASite\/english\/whatsnew_download\/may25_05.html for one \nexample of new developments by telecommunications companies).  Because of this, \nISF\u2019s connections to other organizations and relationships with potential government \nfunders have become increasingly important as a means of procuring funding and \ndeveloping a sustainable model.   \nISF is a participant in the CRACIN research alliance.48  This participation has \nfacilitated contacts with government officials interested in community applications for \ntechnology, such as Canadian Heritage and Industry Canada.  However, despite the \ninterest by government funding agencies for new technical projects, the only public \nfunding for ISF that has materialized has been through its partnership with the Mobile \nDigital Commons Network.  This partnership mandated the creation of new hotspots in \nlocations chosen by artists and the development of the functionality for adding local \ncontent and interactive art.  Although this has been a very productive relationship, ISF \ncontinues to lack sustainable funding, particularly funding that is not linked to \ncommercial interests.  Given the potential benefits of ISF\u2019s technology and community \nand industry partnerships, the group is hopeful that public funding agencies and \norganizations will be interested in supporting them.  However, initial contact with federal \nrepresentatives from other departments, especially Industry Canada, which provides \ngrants for technological development, has been positive but confused.  Canada\u2019s funding \ninitiatives are increasingly designed to promote the development of new initiatives in the \n  30 \n \n\u201csocial economy,\u201d [May we eliminate the quotation marks here?] which refers to the \nentrepreneurial, not-for-profit sector whose objectives include enhancing the social, \neconomic, and environmental conditions of communities.  The social economy, which \nreceived policy attention in the February 2004 Speech from the Throne49, aims to create \neconomically viable businesses that provide important social services; for example, day \ncare services are considered social economy enterprises.  However, there is no provision \nfor funding the research and development of a product that is freely given away, not sold \nfor commercial benefit, making it difficult for ISF to receive Industry Canada funding for \nthe development of Wifi Dog software. \n As an organization, ISF, therefore, falls between the cracks of government \nfunding programs: it is neither purely an incubator for eventual mass market technologies \nnor does it have an explicitly social mandate.  However, it is poised to contribute greatly \nto both of these areas and might be motivated to do so if an appropriate funding \norganization could be found.  In the meantime, ISF has been approached by several \ndifferent businesses interested in creating partnerships.  For the most part, these proposed \npartnerships have not, in the opinion of the group, provided much of a financial or \nstrategic advantage nor have they allowed ISF to maintain its autonomy.  Only one \npartnership has thus far been undertaken: an agreement with a wireless telephony \nprovider compensated ISF for opening some of their communication ports to telephony \ntraffic.  This partnership has recently resulted in a small payout by the company, which \nwill go towards financing core ISF activities, including future fundraising. \n ISF is presently attempting to negotiate strategies for sustainability.  They are \nproposing to extend the partnership with the mobile telephone company; begin grant \n  31 \n \nwriting projects aimed at competing for grants to support the development of community-\nbased information services, e-government, and local content creation; and potentially \nexplore more marketing options.  The group is primarily interested in remaining self-\nsufficient and sustainable and would like to remain relevant as a community-oriented \ntechnology facilitator and delivery system for local content and art.  \nISF continues to improve its system of provision of hotspots, its portal pages, and \nthe functionality of its authorization server.  The group\u2019s name has become well known \nthrough positive media coverage and word-of-mouth; some group members consider the \nmedia interest in ISF to be one of the group\u2019s major advantages.  However, they are not \nthe only group working on providing wireless access in Montreal.  ISF is facing \ncompetition from commercial groups, while a similar community-based group, Laval \nSans-Fil, operates in the nearby suburb of Laval.  In Montreal, Zone Wi-Fi, which is also \ninterested in unwiring sections of the city using a \u201csocial economy\u201d business model, \ncontinues to lobby municipal government officials for support.  In addition, local for-\nprofit hotspot providers (including Eye-In and other smaller operations) are opening their \nown networks of hotspots, and large wireless Internet aggregators (such as Boingo) are \nadding Montreal hotspots to their lengthening global lists of access points.  Furthermore, \nthe major wireless carriers in Canada have just announced a partnership aimed at \nexpanding Wi-Fi service between major carriers (see \nhttp:\/\/www.cwta.ca\/CWTASite\/english\/whatsnew_download\/may25_05.html).  This \nservice would make it easier for customers of every major wireless telecom company to \npurchase Wi-Fi services, even those provided by their provider\u2019s competition.  All of this \ncreates an enormous pressure for Ile Sans Fil to either transform itself into a commercial \n  32 \n \nentity or to form strategic alliances with other groups.  Given that Ile Sans Fil prides itself \non its self-reliance and innovation, these pressures may be difficult to negotiate.   \nConclusion \nBoth Canadian municipal and community Wi-Fi initiatives are in an early stage of \ninception and development, and it is therefore difficult to speculate on their trajectory \ngiven the uncertainty of the outcome of current telecommunication policy reforms and a \nrapidly shifting technical terrain.  However, it is interesting to reflect on the optimism and \nnearly evangelical fervor with which earlier community networks were created and to \nperhaps exercise caution in our assessment of whether and how the current crop of \ncommunity Wi-Fi ventures can remain rooted in the local community and contribute to \nlocal cultural content creation. \nAlthough community WiFi projects share many of the same goals as their \npredecessors, and groups such as ISF are fueled by the exuberant energy of committed \nvolunteers, the sustainability of these initiatives is perhaps more fraught.  So far, a wider \npopulace needs to be actively engaged in using WiFi public spots \u2013 and to get around the \ncurrent elitism of the user population, more partnerships need to be created among a \ndiversity of community organizations and public spaces so that citizens who do not own \ntheir own laptop can use WiFi services with laptops provided.  Synergies with \nmunicipalities might be a powerful incentive to develop diverse community WiFi \ninitiatives where content can go beyond the provision of municipal services to include \nmore targeted local content.  So far, public-private partnerships in Canada appear to be \nmutually advantageous; however, as commercial entrepreneurs and industry become \nencouraged by the popularity of hotspots, care must be taken that content does not reflect \n  33 \n \nonly commercial interests.  The potential for using Wi-Fi and other forms of mobile \ntechnologies for cultural production is increasing, as initiatives like the Mobile Digital \nCommons Network highlights. \nResearch directions \nISF is not unique among community WiFi groups in its need to broaden its user \nbase.  Fuentes-Bautista and Inagaki, in their study on the multiple dynamics and \nstakeholders configuring WiFi access in Austin, Texas, point out \u201cwireless divides\u201d [May \nwe eliminate the quotation marks here?]wherein service is limited in areas where ethnic \nminority and low-income citizens live.  They write, \u201cAustin\u2019s public Wi-Fi initiatives as \na whole have failed so far to turn the opportunity provided by the unlicensed spectrum \ninto a program attending to the issue of digital inequalities in the city.\u201d  They challenge \nWi-Fi providers, local governments, and policymakers to attend to creative efforts to \n\u201cdeliver the promise of universal broadband access through the unlicensed spectrum\u201d \n(2005, p. 33). 50  These challenges apply equally to ISF and other Canadian Wi-Fi \nprojects, especially in urban areas.  However, Wi-Fi technology may be particularly \nuseful in rural areas.  BCWireless has attempted to develop technologies that can be \ninexpensively and flexibly adopted by remote British Columbia communities.  Its testing \nand experimentation may help rural areas find better last-mile solutions permitting high-\nspeed access.  As time passes, it seems likely that more and more of these local initiatives \nwill replace or augment services provided by major telcos.  However, since fixed wireless \nservices remain out of reach for many municipalities, it is important that Industry Canada \ncontinue to provide adequate license-exempt spectrum for open wireless installations.  In \naddition, Canadian municipalities should monitor the laws being passed in some \n  34 \n \nAmerican jurisdictions that forbid public-community partnerships.  These laws are based \nin a presupposition that government-supported, universal access to information \ninfrastructure is inherently dangerous for competitive telecom development.  An adoption \nof this type of law in Canada would limit the development of community-based projects \nsuch as \u00cele Sans Fil and the Fred eZone and would go against the policy position that \ntelecommunications are a public good.  \nMeanwhile, more research needs to be undertaken to investigate the developing \ncommunity wireless experience in Canada.  If, over time, portable wireless devices \nbecome more affordable, will the uses of community-based wireless services change?  \nOr, will the development of this technology follow that of Canada\u2019s original community \nnetworks?  We could do well to heed the advice of Meinrath who admonishes us to \nbecome technically savvy and engaged with these technologies: \u201cThe challenge then is \nfor an engaged public to build these cost-effective alternatives and become active agents \nin determining the future of the wireless telecommunication infrastructure\u201d (2005, p. \n236).51 \n \nAcknowledgments \nThanks to the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada \n(SSHRC) for their support of the CRACIN project in writing this paper. \n  \n  35 \n \nFootnotes \n1 Feld, H., Rose, G., Cooper, M. & Scott, B.

Typically relying on \ngovernment and industry partnerships, Smart Communities can be found in major \nwestern cities and regions, including San Diego, Hong Kong, Singapore, Ottawa, and \nCalgary, as well as suburban communities such as Vaughn, Ontario, and in developing \ncountries such as Malaysia\u2019s Smart Masyarakat.  Smart Community initiatives are an \n\u201cintegrated approach to helping entire communities go on-line to connect local \ngovernments, schools, businesses, citizens, and health and social services in order to \ncreate specific services to address local objectives and to help advance collective skills \nand capacities.\u201d  See Coe, A., Paquet, G., & Roy, J.
