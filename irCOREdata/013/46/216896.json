The renewed relevance of religion in the public sphere has been accompanied by \nconspicuous and locally controversial conversion processes. This article compares cases of conversion \non the Muslim\u2013Christian frontier in Kyrgyzstan and in Georgia. It argues that the notions of boundary \nand frontier are essential to construct a more dynamic model for understanding \u2018spiritual\u2019 movement \nin social contexts that are rapidly changing. This approach in turn sheds light on the roles and the \nnature of social and cultural boundaries in the contemporary world.  \nKeywords: boundaries; conversion; movement; Orthodox Christianity; Pentecostalism; post-socialism \n \nPioneers on the frontier \nWith his full beard and black cassock Father Meriani was a striking presence in the town of Khulo, \nlocated in the hinterland of Georgia\u2019s Autonomous Republic of Ajaria. During our conversations in \n2001 he often talked about the newly built church and the Christian lyceum, of which he was the \ndirector, as important steps in realizing a future in which the Muslim inhabitants of Ajaria would \nreturn to their \u2018native\u2019 faith \u2013 Orthodox Christianity. Meriani was aware that this envisioned process \nwas fraught with difficulties. Four years previously his Bishop had assigned Meriani to Khulo, in part \n 2 \nbecause his wife hailed from the town.\n1\n His congregation had grown steadily, but he had also faced \nstiff opposition from a part of the population. Local Muslim leaders had led several (unsuccessful) \ncampaigns to close down the lyceum, and his family had been the target of vicious gossip. To illustrate \nthe obstacles, Father Meriani told me what had happened to the grave of his stillborn son. He and his \nwife had buried their child in his wife\u2019s family\u2019s graveyard and had placed a small wooden cross on \nthe grave. One week later the cross had disappeared. Meriani suspected that some of his in-laws had \nbeen the culprits, but he simply put a new (now metal) cross on the grave, and this time no one messed \nwith it. Meriani spoke with some pride about the grave being the only Christian grave, and visibly so, \nin an otherwise Muslim graveyard.  \nDespite such difficulties \u2013 and most converts told me about their own personal hardships \u2013 by \n2001 a sizable minority of the town\u2019s inhabitants had converted to Orthodox Christianity.2 This growth \nposed its own problems, and Father Meriani expressed concern that the expansion of his church was \nnot necessarily accompanied with a deepening of Christian knowledge. Some new Christians seemed \nto be more interested in the image of Georgian Orthodoxy than in its spiritual ideas or doctrinal \nknowledge. In conversion narratives the Georgian nation figured particularly prominently, such as in \nthe case of an elderly men who, when baptized, expressed his exaltation of finally being \u2018baptized \nGeorgian\u2019. Such notions were understandable given that Islam had been associated with an Ottoman \npast which had been vilified in official discourse since the beginnings of Soviet rule, while the link \nbetween the Georgian nation and Christian faith had become the bedrock of nationalist ideology in the \npost-Soviet era. The Church\u2019s stance on this issue was ambivalent. Father Meriani, for example, never \nhesitated to prompt the link between the Church and the nation, but simultaneously stressed the deep \nand uncorrupted spirituality of Orthodox Christianity. This ambivalence appeared to reflect a \npragmatic approach: perhaps these first converts did not convert for spiritual reasons but in making the \nfirst step they paved the way for their children to become true Christians. \n* * * \n 3 \n Several thousand kilometers to the East in the Kyrgyz Republic, pastor Kadyrjan\n3\n similarly held grand \nvisions for his congregation. After \u2018coming to faith\u2019 in the Pentecostal \u2018Full Gospel Church of Jesus \nChrist\u2019 (CJC) in 1996, he had become a very active church member. Three years later Kadyrjan was \ncalled by God to establish his own congregation; he and his family moved to Jalal-Abad, the \nprovincial capital of a province (oblast) with the same name, and known in Kyrgyzstan for being \u2018very \nMuslim\u2019. The family experienced a difficult first year, but in 2003 the congregation had over 200 \ntithe-paying members, and Kadyrjan had overseen the \u2018planting\u2019 of five new congregations in the \nprovince.  \nSome of these new congregations were growing steadily, but the one that frequently occupied \nKadyrjan\u2019s mind was a congregation in the nearby mining-town Kok-Jangak. When Kadyrjan had first \nstarted activities there in 2001 he had cooperated with some locally residing Russian Pentecostals. \nAfter having attracted a sizable crowd of sixty to eighty Russian and Kyrgyz attendants for a few \nmonths, the congregation imploded amidst internal bickering. Kadyrjan made a second attempt in \nautumn 2002, when he sent a female Kyrgyz church member to live as a missionary and church leader \nin the town. This time the prospects seemed promising and for about a year the church services and \nprayer meetings were well attended, mostly by Kyrgyz women. But by spring 2004 interest had \ndwindled once again, and Kadyrjan was worried that his efforts would once again fail to produce the \ndesired result.  \nMembership fluctuations in Kok-Jangak were certainly more extreme than in Jalal-Abad \nwhere there was a larger stable core of church members. Nevertheless, even in Jalal-Abad many \nconversions to Pentecostalism were of a temporary nature. According to Kadyrjan, \u2018If you counted all \nthose who converted in my church, it would add up to something like 800 believers\u2019. But there were \nonly 200 to 250 who still participated in church life. Some of the others had moved to different \nChristian churches, but the majority had \u2013 for a variety of reasons \u2013 abandoned Christianity altogether. \nGiven these frequent \u2018temporary conversions\u2019 it was understandable that more textually oriented \nevangelicals looked down upon the CJC. From their perspective, the emphasis on healing and emotion \nas well as the perceived thinness of biblical knowledge in Kadyrjan\u2019s Pentecostal Church was bound \n 4 \nto produce \u2018unstable converts\u2019. But Kadyrjan saw this differently. From his point of view not everyone \ncould be saved, and there were many forces which pulled people back. It was his task to fight these \nforces and he drew on the Holy Spirit to combat them, for example in Kok-Jangak. Kadyrjan and the \nlocal missionary had decided that their most immediate task was to lift the \u2018satanic fog\u2019 that shrouded \nthe mining town. Once a week a group of church members climbed the tallest nearby hill from where \nthey collectively prayed for the fate of the town. If only enough believers would join in faithful prayer \nthe satanic fog would dissolve and a vibrant church would finally take root. \n* * * \nFather Meriani and pastor Kadyrjan were men with a vision and a mission. Their mission was to \nestablish viable churches in Muslim settings and to guide local inhabitants to the \u2018true faith\u2019. They \nboth tended to speak with confidence and conviction, useful traits for men working in hostile territory. \nAlthough their goals were spiritual in nature, the obstacles they encountered were rooted in everyday \nlife. Nothing was fixed on the frontier, and the forces of \u2018evil\u2019 were omnipresent. \nJuxtaposing these two examples prompts the question of comparability. Despite having \nconducted extensive research on missionary encounters and conversion in these two settings, I have \nthus far avoided linking them together systematically, mainly because the differences appeared too \noverwhelming.\n4\n In doctrine and practice, Georgian Orthodox Christianity with its emphasis on \ntradition, ritual and communion is very different from charismatic Pentecostalism with its emphasis on \nindividual faith and the power of prayer. The social contexts in which these religious actors operated \nwere only to some extent similar. While both were predominantly Muslim settings, in Ajaria new \nChristians were joining the majority faith of their imagined nation, while converts in Kyrgyzstan were \noften seen as betraying not only Islam but also their Kyrgyz nationality. The institutional organization \nof the Churches was also different. Father Meriani operated in a national, hierarchically ordered, \necclesiastical structure (the Georgian Apostolic Autocephalous Orthodox Church). Pastor Kadyrjan \nwas a more independent religious entrepreneur, though linked to a large, vibrant, and fast-growing \nPentecostal Church with numerous links to churches worldwide (see Pelkmans 2009b). Given these \n 5 \ndifferences, it is hardly surprising that conversion experiences varied between these two cases, as will \nbe documented below.  \nNevertheless, we are dealing with two post-Soviet environments in which conversion away \nfrom Islam became significant phenomena after 1990, a fact which should allow for careful \ncomparison. Similarities can also be found at more intimate levels, as the opening stories illustrated. \nBoth religious leaders could be characterized as true frontiersmen, as religious and cultural brokers \nwho not only attempted to facilitate a one-directional passage from one religious formation to the \nother, but also tried to transform the wider socio-religious landscape in which they operated. \n In this article I reflect on such similarities as well as on the manifold differences in order to \nshed light on conversion dynamics. I will do so by bringing together ideas and concepts that have been \nat the center of debate in what can respectively be called the \u2018anthropology of borders\u2019 and the \n\u2018anthropology of conversion\u2019. Both fields of investigation are essentially about difference and how \ndifference is maintained, negotiated, or utilized, as well as about how people cross the boundaries \nbetween different categories. If in the anthropology of borders these categories tend to refer to \nadjoining territories \u2013 or to \u2018ethnic groups\u2019 in the Fredrick Barth-inspired branch of such debates \u2013 it is \nequally possible to apply border discussions to religious categories. Seen from the reverse perspective, \ninsights gained in the study of conversion dynamics can be fruitfully employed to shed light on the \nrole of nature of borders and boundaries in contemporary life. \n \nConceptualizing conversion (in post-Soviet contexts) \nSince the early 1990s religious landscapes across the former Soviet Union have been in flux. Seventy \nyears of militant secularism had ended and religion attained renewed public significance. This was true \nfor locally-rooted faiths, such as Sunni Islam in the Republic of Kyrgyzstan, and Orthodox \nChristianity in the Republic of Georgia. But the \u2018de-privatization\u2019 (Casanova 1994) of autochthonous \nreligions was accompanied by frictions and unexpected new developments. The social fields in which \nreligious activities re-appeared were different from those in which Soviet leaders had started to repress \n 6 \nreligious expression in the 1920s. The effects of economic development, Soviet style modernization, \nurbanization, forced and voluntary migration, and Soviet nationality policies meant that religion could \nand did not simply \u2018revive\u2019.5 Religion was playing new roles on personal, familial, and societal levels. \nMoreover, large numbers of people throughout the former Soviet Union felt excluded from these \u2018de-\nprivatized\u2019 autochthonous religions and\/or felt attracted to \u2018new\u2019 religious movements that did not \nhave local historical roots. As recent anthropological studies suggest, significant processes of \nconversion are occurring across post-Soviet Eurasia (e.g. Wanner 2006; Vallikivi 2009; Vate 2009; \nLankauskas 2002; Pelkmans 2009a). \nBut what does religious conversion entail, and how does the Soviet legacy reveal itself in \nprocesses of conversion? A discussion of the concept and its complexities is useful at this point. One \nof the earliest social scientific definitions characterizes conversion as a \u2018definite crossing of religious \n[boundaries] in which an old spiritual home was left for a new one once and for all\u2019 (Nock 1933).6 \nThis definition, which to some extent mirrors the popular Western understanding of the term, draws \nheavily on the ideal-typical Biblical \u2018Pauline model\u2019, in which conversion is imagined as a sudden \nrupture and all-embracing personal transformation, thereby imputing stable qualities to \u2018pre-\u2018 and \n\u2018post-\u2018 religious adherences.7 This model contains many problematic assumptions. Indeed, we may ask \nif it is at all appropriate to speak of spiritual homes or religions? For example, to what extent did \npeople who lived through a period of state-atheism have a \u2018spiritual home\u2019? Likewise, why would we \nneed to assume that the crossing of the boundary is definite? What about conversions that produced \nonly partial change or were temporary as in the Kyrgyz case? Moreover, to what extent can we isolate \n\u2013 or should we prioritize \u2013 the spiritual aspect of the journey, given that conversion processes are \ninfluenced by a larger interplay of identity politics, discourses of morality, and economic concerns? \nThe link between nationality and faith in the Georgian case springs to mind.  \nSuch difficulties are not limited to post-Soviet settings. Some influential anthropologists have \nargued more generally that the term conversion obscures more than it reveals, and therefore might \nbetter be abandoned. Thus, the Comaroffs ask, rhetorically: \u2018how well does [the concept of \nconversion] grasp the highly variable, usually gradual, often implicit, and demonstrably \u201csyncretic\u201d \n 7 \nmanner in which the social identities, cultural styles, and ritual practices of African peoples were \ntransformed by the evangelical encounter\u2019 (Comaroff and Comaroff 1991: 250). In contrast, other \nanthropologists have argued that in a world in which religion, religious practice, or at least religious \naffiliation is increasingly politically relevant, the term has renewed currency. As David Gellner notes: \n\u2018Religious change is conventionally only labeled conversion when it occurs across boundaries. Thus, \nas boundaries have become sharper between \u201creligions\u201d, so the issue of conversion has grown in \npolitical significance\u2019 (2005: 755). \nBoth positions have value. The skepticism of the first view rightly warns against making \nassumptions about the content or shape of conversion and is a reminder that too much effort has been \nwasted on trying to define what conversion is. On the other hand, when religion re-asserts itself in \npublic life such as in the former Soviet Union, \u2018personal\u2019 religious shifts may acquire social and \npolitical significance as well, which in turn adds importance to the concept of conversion. The logical \nway out of this conundrum is to treat \u2018conversion\u2019 not as an objective fact and even less as an \nanalytical tool, but as a sensitizing concept that serves to tie together a number of related processes. In \nfact, the definitions of conversion presented above \u2013 those of Nock (1933), Gellner (2005) and even \nthe Comaroffs\u2019 (1991) non-definition \u2013 indicate which elements should be at the center of analysis. \n1. Conversion is about religious categories (or spiritual homes). But since the content, coherence, \nand relevance of \u2018religious categories\u2019 are not fixed, changes in the meaning of these \ncategories need to be thoroughly analyzed. \n2. Conversion is about movement \u2013 about people who are moving or changing spiritually. But \nsince change is relative, it can also be about stasis in a changing world. \n3. Conversion is about crossing boundaries. But since these boundaries are not always existent \nprior to conversion, it can also be about creating boundaries. \nEach of these elements will be examined more closely in the sections below. Here it suffices to say \nthat we need an approach that looks at religious conversion as spiritual as well as social change or \nmovement \u2013 movement that crosses and thereby creates and\/or dissolves symbolic and social \n 8 \nboundaries. The rigidity or porosity of these boundaries depends on the particular conversion context, \nand this context changes as a consequence of the occurrence of conversion. Therefore the cultural, \nsocial and symbolic content of conversion, the trajectories, and the implications will vary between \ndifferent settings, as this article will show. \n \nFragile homes \u2013 the backdrop to conversion \nThe first point, about \u2018spiritual homes\u2019 (that are left for new ones), is clearly problematic in the case of \nthe former Soviet Union. Although one has to be careful with sweeping generalizations, Soviet rule \ndid result in lower levels of doctrinal knowledge and involvement in institutionalized religious life \namong most people. Taking up this point, cultural theorists such as Epstein (1994) and Borenstein \n(1999) depicted the post-Soviet religious landscape as consisting of an undifferentiated mass of new \n\u2018believers\u2019 (veruiushschii) who were free to pick and choose from diverse religious traditions. The \npoint is well taken, but low levels of doctrinal knowledge do not necessarily create \u2018undifferentiated \nmasses\u2019 \u2013 for example because (nominal) religious affiliation often continued to be grafted onto or \nmixed with ideas about ethnicity, nationality, and culture. Such links were very salient in the cases of \nGeorgia and Kyrgyzstan. Therefore, even if involvement in institutionalized religious life had been \nlow, conversion to Christianity was not uncontroversial. The introductory stories of pastor Kadyrjan \nand Father Meriani illustrated some of these difficulties, but more historical background is needed to \ngrasp the motivations, considerations, and experiences of converts to Christianity. \n* * * \nThe territory that now makes up Georgia\u2019s Autonomous Republic of Ajaria had been part of the \nOttoman Empire between the sixteenth and the nineteenth centuries, during which its previously \nChristian inhabitants converted to Islam. Not much is known about this pre-modern conversion to \nIslam, except that it was a drawn out process which was only completed by the 1850s, and in which \npolitical alliances, wars, economic incentives, and the lure of \u2018The Porte\u2019 Istanbul played important \nroles. Although the inhabitants of Ajaria spoke a Georgian dialect, by the end of the nineteenth century \n 9 \nOttoman Turkish had become the main public language. Well into the 20th century, these Ajarians \nfailed to identify with the (Christian) Georgian imagined nation. However, this situation started to \nchange during Soviet rule when Ajarians were classified as Georgians. Ajarians did initially not \nidentify with this classification, but over the course of seventy years the cultural politics of the Soviet \nUnion managed to alter the way Ajarians saw themselves, with the younger generations and especially \nthe Soviet middle class increasingly identifying with the Georgian nation (see Pelkmans 2006 for an \nextensive discussion). This process of national identification was facilitated by the banishment of \nreligion from the public sphere, because this allowed inhabitants to \u2018act\u2019 Georgian in public and \nMuslim at home. \n  This situation changed again in the 1990s. Georgian nationality became tightly connected to \nOrthodox Christianity, while new possibilities of religious expression meant that religious affiliation - \nwhether Muslim or Christian \u2013 was increasingly acted out in public. To be simultaneously Muslim and \nGeorgian became problematic. In this new situation the Orthodox Church started a campaign to \u2018bring \nAjarians back to their native Georgian faith\u2019. Although not leading to the swift mass baptism hoped \nfor by the church, a steady process of conversion has taken place, with tens of thousands of Muslim \nconverts to Christianity in a Autonomous Republic with approximately 300,000 inhabitants. \n  * * * \nIn Kyrgyzstan, Islam had been and continued to be the dominant religion. Even if the Kyrgyz wove \nmany shamanic and other cultural elements into their religious practices and beliefs (see Privratsky \n2001; Abramzon 1971), Islam had become an indispensable part of social and cultural life well before \nthe incorporation of contemporary Kyrgyzstan into the Tsarist Empire. Religious sentiments played a \nmajor role in several uprisings against the Russian colonizers (Brower 2003) and when German \nmissionaries attempted to evangelize the Kyrgyz in the early twentieth century, their attempts utterly \nfailed (Pelkmans 2009a). Soviet militant secularism, especially during the anti-religious campaigns \n(most notably those of the 1930s and the 1950s) dismantled existing religious institutions and \npersecuted Muslim leaders who were unwilling to co-operate closely with the Soviet security agencies. \n 10 \nFew Kyrgyz, however, became committed atheists and even Kyrgyz communist party officials \ncontinued to engage secretly in religious rituals (especially circumcision and funeral rites) (Ro\u2019i 2000). \nAlthough the visible public relevance of Islam had declined, it remained an important point of \nreference for collective identification (see also McBrien and Pelkmans 2008). The fact that Kyrgyz \nidentity was asserted in opposition to the Russian \u2018bigger brother\u2019 secured the importance of the \ncategory Muslim, even if as a cultural rather than a religious marker. \nThese trends had ambiguous effects on the position of Islam in the post-Soviet period. Islam \ncontinued to be an important marker of nationality in Kyrgyzstan after independence. The government \nactively used Islamic symbolism in its nation building efforts, stressing that is was part of the cultural \nheritage of the Kyrgyz. But this emphasis on the cultural aspects of Islam meant that the spiritual \ncontent was largely ignored. For Christian missionaries this offered opportunities while also posing \nobstacles. The associations of Christianity with Russianness posed a problem for foreign and local \nchurch leaders who responded by trying to disentangle the links between religion and culture. Pastor \nKadyrjan, for example, would repeatedly tell his congregation that Jesus had not died for one nation, \nbut for all humanity. Church members met such answers with approval, but this did not prevent many \nMuslim Kyrgyz from seeing these new Christians as traitors. On the other hand, missionaries and local \nchurch leaders were able to offer new religious answers in situations of hardship. Part of the attraction \nof Pentecostal churches is that they challenge the \u2018corrupt\u2019 world in which they operate. Moreover, by \nexplaining poverty and illness in terms of a corrupt world under the spell of Satan, they also provide \nvery concrete answers to problems related to the social and economic dislocations of the postsoviet \nand Muslim space. In addition, they are able to draw on a transnational imagery in which wealth, \naffluence, and a general better life is associated with North America and Europe, that is, the regions \nfrom which most missionaries arrived and are generally seen as the \u2018homeland\u2019 of Christianity. Their \nsuccess is demonstrated by numbers. About 25,000 ethnic Kyrgyz converted to evangelical (including \nPentecostal) Christianity, in addition to numerous Russians, Koreans, and Tatars living in Kyrgyzstan. \n* * * \n 11 \nThe destabilization of Muslim contexts proved a fertile ground for conversion movements. Soviet \nsecularism failed to produce atheists, but by pushing religion into the domestic sphere and by partly \ndestroying and partly co-opting religious institutions, it had seriously weakened the influence of Islam \nin the public sphere. These processes meant that religion was increasingly equated with \u2018local culture\u2019. \nIn Kyrgyzstan the connections between culture and religion were newly employed by secular \nauthorities, but this also produced discontent among those who were looking for more than a \nsacralized form of national ideology, especially when the enthusiasm about independence waned with \nthe continuing economic crisis and political instability. In Georgia\u2019s Autonomous Republic of Ajaria \nthese links between culture and nationality produced different tensions. Islam was likewise associated \nwith \u2018a culture\u2019, but with the \u2018wrong one\u2019 and became a symbol of backwardness instead. The \nGeorgian nation continued to have allure for a significant part of Ajaria\u2019s population, and the \nincreasing centrality of Christianity in the national imagination made the combination of Muslim \nGeorgians seem as an oxymoron.  \n Phrased differently, the lack of a stable original spiritual home did not mean that no (social, \nethnic, cultural) boundaries were crossed. In fact such boundaries were created or at least re-\ninvigorated as a result of conversion. The re-enchantment of social life in Kyrgyzstan and Ajaria \nentailed a process in which \u2018old\u2019 and \u2018new\u2019 spiritual homes were gaining new meaning and content. \nTo clarify this further we need to look at the various moves and twists of converts, focusing on their \nconversion experiences. \n \nMoving spiritually and socially \nAfter having discussed the relative incoherence of spiritual homes, the next issue is to discuss the \ntrajectories and routes of those who converted. As conversion is about change or movement \u2013 of \npeople moving spiritually \u2013 it is useful to compare it to other types of movement, such as those we \nfind in migration. Resemblances can be found not least because conversion rarely entails only a \nspiritual shift; it often also involves moves or turns in the social situated-ness of converts, as well as \n 12 \nshifts in the way they perceive their social and cultural surrounding. This implies that converts are not \nmoving as fixed entities but as subjects who change while \u2018traveling\u2019. To borrow Tim Ingold\u2019s \nanalogy, living things tend to move less like solid objects such as automobiles or airplanes but more \nlike flexible trees in the wind or as clouds: it is movement \u2018that builds up in front and dissipates \nbehind\u2019,8 meanwhile leaving traces on the social and cultural fabric of the environments in which this \nmovement occurs. \n  * * * \nMalkhaz claimed to have been predisposed towards religion from childhood onwards, but because he \ngrew up in Kholo he had only known about Islam. The turning point came when he was thirteen years \nold in 1989: \u2018A man came to our school to talk about Christianity. It came as a shock to learn about \nanother religion and after that I started to read about [Christianity]\u2019. Initially Malkhaz was mostly \nimpressed with the images of Georgian Christian history: the old churches and monasteries, the \nheydays of the Christian Georgian kingdom and its continuing legacy in literature and architecture. \u2018I \nwasn\u2019t even thinking about being baptized at the time, but something in my heart pulled me to \nChristianity. I slowly came to understand that it is the true faith\u2019. After entering university in Batumi \nin 1994 he found himself among Christian friends who invited him to attend church. It was then only a \nsmall step, he explained, to decide being baptized. \n When Malkhaz told his parents about his baptism they were outraged. According to Malkhaz, \nhis father had previously hardly paid attention to Islam, but after his son converted this changed: \u2018For \nhim it was all about the neighbors and how they would see our family\u2019, Malkhaz said, thereby \ndownplaying the sincerity of his father\u2019s reported new mosque attendance. For several years Malkhaz \nhad not been welcome at his parental home, but in the two years after he had returned to Khulo \u2013 \nwhere he was now teaching at the Christian lyceum \u2013 he had visited them a couple of times. \u2018There is \nstill a distance between us. We don\u2019t really talk, but at least the hostilities have ended\u2019, he said. And \nwhen his sister was baptized in 1999 his parents more or less accepted it, perhaps because conversion \nwas becoming a more widespread, and seemingly inevitable, phenomenon in the region. \n 13 \n Like Malkhaz, the majority of new Christians were from families who used to belong to the \nSoviet middle class \u2013 teachers, medical personnel, mid-level bureaucrats \u2013 families who had invested \nin education and envisioned administrative or service-sector careers for their children. They had \nmoved up the social ladder during the Soviet period and in doing so they had partly distanced \nthemselves from their rural (Muslim) backgrounds. As their careers and their aspirations had been \nclosely intertwined with the state structures, they also tended to be the ones who identified most \nintensely with the Georgian nation. After the Soviet collapse, and the factual bankruptcy of the welfare \nstate, they had suddenly experienced a decline in their economic and social status. Seen from this \nperspective, conversions to Orthodox Christianity could be understood, at least partly, as attempts to \nsecure their middle class position, while re-asserting their loyalty to a Georgian nation now imagined \nalong Christian lines.  \n Of these new Christians many were convinced that they formed the avant-garde of a much \nlarger process of change. As one woman told me: \u2018At the moment the Christian community may still \nbe small, but you will see that in ten or twenty years the majority will be Christian\u2019.9 Of course, these \nnew Christians realized that their baptism had produced tensions in their direct social surrounding. \nThis prompted them to justify their actions. Rather than using the term \u2018conversion\u2019 they preferred to \nsay that they had returned to their native faith. Otari, for example, stressed that he was more of a \ntraditionalist than his Muslim wife: \u2018you see, my family arrived 150 years ago from [the Christian \nregion] Ozurgeti to Khulo, and all I am doing is reviving that history, my family\u2019s traditions\u2019. \nMalkhaz, who was introduced above, similarly argued that he was not trying to break away from his \nroots: \u2018the thing is, I love this region and its people. I want to keep the good parts and just get rid off \nthe bad and foreign elements. But unfortunately there are many people here who are trying to \n[accomplish] the opposite\u2019. Obviously those other people did not agree on the normative value and the \nlabel \u2018foreign\u2019 that Malkhaz attached to Islam. \nApart from casting their own actions in a positive light, another recurring feature in these \nnarratives were attempts to downplay the \u2018difference\u2019 of the non-converted. This was obvious from \nMallkhaz\u2019s intimation that his father only went to the mosque to keep up appearances. Along similar \n 14 \nlines Vakhtang, a middle-aged man, commented: \u2018Many Muslims aren\u2019t real Muslims. They have a \nGeorgian soul and the Georgian soul is Christian.\u2019 Both discursive moves tried to smooth out the \ndisruptive effect of conversion, even if from a position of perceived superiority. \n  * * * \nAigul, a young woman living in Jalal-Abad, had first visited a Pentecostal church in 2001 when she \nvisited a cousin in Bishkek (Kyrgyzstan\u2019s capital) who happened to be a member of the CJC there:  \nI was so impressed \u2013 I even said the prayer of confession (molitvo pokoianie, R). But then I \nforgot about it and didn\u2019t go to church for more than a year. That was when my problems \nstarted: I got pregnant; the child\u2019s father left me; my mother chased me out of our house so I \nwouldn\u2019t bring shame to the family. I wanted to die in those days.  \nIt was then that Aigul decided to go to Kadyrjan\u2019s church. She immediately felt at home. What struck \nher most was that everyone hugged each other after the service, even people who didn\u2019t know each \nother\u2019. Two years later Aigul was still an active church member and told me that God had helped her \nin every possible way. Unsurprisingly, her parents had disapproved strongly when they heard (from \nothers) that their daughter had become a Christain, but since she no longer lived in their house there \nwas little they could do besides criticizing her behavior. Instead, \u2018they tried to bribe me. They offered \nto buy me an apartment if I promised to renounce (otrekat\u2019sia) Jesus\u2019. Aigul smiled when she \nmentioned it and added that God had given her a job. She was thus no longer in direct need of her \nparents\u2019 assistance; anyway, her faith was not for sale. \nIf in Ajaria the first converts tended to be well-educated and of middle class background, the \npatterns were different for the Pentecostal church in Kyrgyzstan. In a survey I conducted among 130 \nchurch members in Jalal-Abad, the majority were recent rural-urban migrants to the city. Women in \ngeneral were over-represented, in particular divorced, widowed and remarried women. These patterns \nmay be explained by noting that migrants and divorced women tend to be poorly integrated into the \nsocial fabric of the city, and thus more inclined to join a movement that provides close-knit social ties \nand promises health and prosperity. As Aigul\u2019s story illustrated, divorcees and migrants are also \n 15 \nremoved from their original social surroundings and thus under less pressure to conform to social (and \nreligious) expectations and obligations.  \n These issues recurred in conversion stories, in which the key patterns revolved around \nexperiences of illness and poverty, the immorality of post-Soviet life, and how the new faith had \nenabled them to overcome these various personal crises. One middle-aged Kyrgyz woman living with \nher three children in Jalal-Abad, described her experiences as follows:  \n\u2018When my daughter fell sick I was at a complete loss. Without money or relatives I couldn\u2019t \neven go to the hospital! Then Sajada eje [referring to an older female church member] told me \nabout Jesus and brought me here. I began to pray for the recovery of my daughter and she \nrecovered! Since then life has become much easier for me\u2019. \nOthers stressed the friendliness and mutual support among believers, stressing that in contrast to their \nprevious friends with other believers one could count on their good intentions. Here it is important to \nnote that church members met at least twice a week, once during the weekly service and once during \nthe obligatory home-church meetings during which they worshipped, studied the bible, and discussed \nthe various difficulties of life. \n The church\u2019s negative attitude towards alcohol consumption and drug abuse, infidelity, and its \npatriarchal views of the \u2018natural\u2019 roles of men and women were also commented upon positively. \nThese codes of moral behavior were not simply valued for the sake of doing the \u2018right\u2019 thing. Rather, \nthe messages of \u2018morality\u2019 were important because they were seen as providing solutions to everyday \nproblems. One Kyrgyz woman, for example, explained how she had used the church\u2019s ideas about \npatriarchy to flatter her husband\u2019s ego and to encourage him to be a more effective breadwinner. \nResonating the experiences of several other male church members, one man commented on the \nchurch\u2019s ban on drugs use by saying that he started to believe once his prayers were answered and he \nwas relieved of his drug addiction. In short, this Pentecostal church with its high-intensity community \nlife and emphasis on morality provided social security as well as a sense of purpose in an insecure \nworld. \n 16 \n If conversion to Pentecostalism in Kyrgyzstan could be seen as a response to the immorality of \nthe prevailing social environment, it should also be noted that this response was only effective within \nthe confines of the new religious community. A Kyrgyz woman who had attended several services \naccepted to come to a \u2018home church\u2019 session, but felt repulsed by what she encountered. \u2018[The church \nmembers] were all talking about their past. They had been drug addicts, or alcoholics, some had \ncommitted crimes or had been abused by their husbands. And I thought by myself: what am I doing \nhere, this is only for rejects\u2019. This sentiment resonated with what other non-converted Kyrgyz had \nexpressed, in essence, that despite the emphasis on justness and morality only morally abject people \nwould join the church. Such negative judgments can be understood as defense mechanisms to cope \nwith the occurrence of conversion among members of one\u2019s own ethno-religious group, thereby \nhighlighting that these moral discourses had a limited societal reach.  \n  * * * \nThe above shows that one cannot simply look at the impact of conversion on a community. Both cases \nsuggest that there was no stable baseline community, and that conversion needs to be understood, at \nleast in part, as an effect of internal differentiations and of tensions within the social fabric, especially \nat the interstices of intersecting societal levels. While in Ajaria tensions were exacerbated by the \nrealignment of religious and national identities that left Muslims in an awkward position, in \nKyrgyzstan the social and economic dislocations following the collapse of the Soviet Union had \nmarginalized sizable categories of people. In this context the promises of spiritual as well as social \nmobility offered by these different branches of Christianity proved attractive. Kadyrjan\u2019s Pentecostal \nchurch promised that through faithful prayer believers would be rewarded not only in the afterlife but \nwould be able to conquer their everyday problems. Orthodox Christianity in Ajaria did not offer such \nconcrete answers, but through its association with Georgian civilization, it did serve as a symbol of \nprogress and a better future. \n While there were important similarities in the conversion trajectories in Kyrgyzstan and Georgia, \nin important respects they were very different. In Ajaria new Christians described their experiences as \n 17 \na long and drawn out process \u2013 a learning process \u2013 that slowly led to an understanding of \nOrthodoxy\u2019s doctrinal truths, a process in which they re-found themselves as \u2018true Georgians\u2019. In \nKyrgyzstan the conversion experience tended to be more abrupt, if not necessarily more permanent. \nConversion stories there centered on moments of personal crisis \u2013 illness, addiction, abandonment \u2013 \nand the miraculous solution to these problems once the convert embraced Jesus Christ and became a \nbeliever. These differences reflected the emphasis on personal belief in the Pentecostal Church and the \ncentrality of ritual and doctrine in the Orthodox Church. But equally important, the religious routes \nwere also differently influenced by the social complications that arose in converting. In Ajaria as well \nas Kyrgyzstan, converts faced negative reactions from neighbors and relatives and had to deal with \nnumerous complications in their daily life. However, if early converts were easily branded as traitors \nor ignored as outcasts, changes in the \u2018conversion ratios\u2019 produced different results in these settings. In \nAjaria the occurrence of conversion became more acceptable as more and more Ajarians converted, \nwhereas in Kyrgyzstan larger numbers of converts triggered more intensive re-actions from local \nMuslim leaders.\n10\n To understand such aspects we need to look at boundary maintenance and \nconstruction, and pay attention to the larger fields of power in which such activities are embedded. \n \nBoundaries and frontiers \nEarlier in this article I quoted David Gellner\u2019s (2005) statement that the term conversion tends to be \nreserved for those trajectories that cross religious boundaries and that thus in a world in which religion \nis increasingly politicized (and boundaries become more sensitive), the concept of conversion gains in \nrelevance. The cases of conversion in this article testify to the importance of this statement, and \nsuggest that conversion trajectories partly derive their shape from the porosity or rigidity of existing \nboundaries, or boundaries that are being produced through conversion.  \nThe decision to convert may initially be a personal affair (even if informed by broader \ndiscourses), but the \u2018content\u2019, the \u2018trajectories\u2019, and the \u2018effects\u2019 of religious conversion resonate with \nthe social fields in which these decisions were made. In Khulo and Jalal-Abad these personal decisions \n 18 \nunavoidably triggered negative reactions from relatives and neighbors. This meant that, at least in \nthese settings, converts were not able to waver between religious communities. They either had to \ndissociate themselves further from their previous religious and social background, or recant their \nnewly found belief.\n11\n As mentioned before, in Kyrgyzstan this meant that many conversions turned out \nto be of a temporary nature. One young man told me that in the end he had realized that after all, \n\u2018Jesus is a God for the Russians\u2019, while the stories of others revealed that the pressure leveled by their \nnon-converted relatives, friends, or colleagues, proved to be stronger or more convincing than the \nattractions offered by Christian communities of believers. That is, new boundaries were being formed \nthrough these acts of conversion. As such, these cases of conversion mirror one of the central \nparadoxes of the globalizing world, namely that the partial blurring of religious boundaries (by \ncrossing them) may well trigger re-inscriptions of religious distinctions.\n12\n \nBoth cases dealt with religious boundaries in the making with ethnic connotations. In Ajaria \nconversion to Orthodox Christianity could be seen as an attempt to realign religious affiliation with \nnational identity. But if these new Christians had to cross a religious boundary, Muslims in Ajaria who \nremained Muslim also had to cross boundaries, since the new need to display religious affiliation in \npublic often implied a distancing or at least reinterpretation of ideas about Georgians nationality. In \nKyrgyzstan the boundary continued to coincide with an ethnic and cultural distinction between Kyrgyz \nand Russians. Untangling the links between religious and national identity was indispensible to \nfacilitate the crossing of religious boundaries. \n  * * * \nThe term boundary only partly manages to capture the contours of the social and religious field that \nwas being traveled. The concept only refers to the lines, divides, or points of contact, and has little to \nsay about the power differentials involved in cross-boundary interactions.\n13\n To overcome these caveats \nthe related concept of the frontier has more potential. A rather blunt definition by Kristof from the \n1950s serves to illustrate this. He writes that the frontier used to refer to \u2018the spearhead of light and \nknowledge expanding into the realms of darkness and the unknown. [The frontier was characterized \n 19 \nby] pioneer settlements of a forward-moving culture bent on occupying the whole area\u2019 (1959: 270). \nThat is, these social and cultural fields have a dynamic of their own, which is partly defined by the \nasymmetries between the groups that encounter each other on this frontier. \nKristof\u2019s definition resonates with the self-perception of conversion movements as \n\u2018spearheads of light and knowledge\u2019. Pastor Kadyrjan and Father Meriani saw themselves as pioneers \nin hostile area, as messengers of truth or of \u2018the Good News\u2019. These ideas also thrived among \nmembers of their congregations. But obviously this perception of superiority did not necessarily reflect \nexisting power differentials. At the local level, new Christians were minorities facing negative \nreactions of various kinds. It is in the broader contexts, however, that we find clear differences. \nNational discourses in Kyrgyzstan favored a \u2018moderate\u2019 Islam as part of the national imagination, \nwhereas in Georgia Islam was presented as a threat to the national body. And while Orthodox clergy in \nGeorgia had close ties to the national (secular) establishment, evangelical missionaries in Kyrgyzstan \ndid not have this kind of back-up. At the same time, though, this was part of the evangelical\u2019s strength \nand attraction since disillusion with the Kyrgyz government and the state structures abounded anyway. \nInstead, the evangelical conversion movement was able to draw on globally circulating discourses of \nterrorism and concomitant suspicion of new forms of Islamic devotion, offering entrance into \ntransnational networks that were associated with the wealthy nations of the world.  \n  * * * \nThe term conversion does not define or predict the shape of conversion \u2013 abrupt, gradual, or temporary \n\u2013 that occurred on the frontiers of Islam and Christianity. However, ethnographic study of these \nspiritual moves and changes show that conversion is a useful sensitizing concept for a cluster of socio-\nreligious processes. In these concluding reflections I return to the three key-elements in conversion \u2013 \nmovement, boundaries, and categories \u2013 to re-assess their intertwinement on the basis of the presented \ncase-studies. The conventional image of conversion, both in its popular Western understanding and in \nthe classical social science definition, corresponds more or less to the diagram depicted below. \n 20 \nA\nB\n \nIn this diagram, the convert travels from religion A to religion B, crossing the boundary (or \nboundaries) between these religions. This article has shown the problematic nature of such an \nassumption, yet argued that the tight intertwinement of the key elements underscore the usefulness of \nthis model of conversion as a frame of reference to argue with and against. \n In the reviewed cases the \u2018spiritual homes\u2019 were partly defined in the process of conversion, \nwith non-converts reacting to the occurrence of spiritual movement. In doing so they influenced not \nonly specific conversion trajectories, but also redefined and to some extent objectified their own \n\u2018spiritual home.\u2019 The boundaries between religious categories were neither clearly defined. The Soviet \nattacks on religion meant that such boundaries were porous to begin with, in some cases even non-\nexistent. But the actions of spiritual seekers triggered reactions from their immediate social \nsurrounding, reactions inspired by a wish to defend the cohesiveness of the community. The ensuing \ndynamics of action and reaction set limits to the kinds of action that were possible. In the cases of \nKhulo and Jalal-Abad the inscription of new boundaries meant that the converts could not easily be \n\u2018spiritual consumers\u2019 who freely traversed or zigzagged the boundary.14 \n Although converts were certainly not insensitive to the tensions that their conversion produced \nwithin their families or their neighborhoods, the ideal of community cohesion was just as much theirs. \nNew Christians in Ajaria would even reject the suggestion that they converted, since from their \nperspective they had returned to the religion of their ancestors \u2013 to the true Georgian religion \u2013 and \nthey saw their own role as paving the way for further integration of Ajarians into the Georgian \nnational community. In Kyrgyzstan converts could not rely on a dominant nationalist discourse. But \nthey did have a sense of entering a global community of Christians. And many new Christians \n 21 \nsuggested that only such a spiritual move would be able to address the intense disintegration, \nimmorality, and lack of cohesion that according to them characterized Kyrgyz society. \n Taking this line of thought further one can even question if it were the converts who were \nmoving or changing. Clearly we are talking about change in a changing context, and this meant that in \nsome respects the converts to Christianity were merely trying to regain what they had lost or feared \nloosing: access to services and ordered communal life such as in Kyrgyzstan, or being a part of the \nlarger national body such as in Ajaria. In other words, the experience of converts can be likened to \nthose of people who after territorial readjustments find themselves to be inhabitants of a foreign \ncounty. The notion \u2018we didn\u2019t cross the border, the border crossed us\u201915 is reflected in the experiences \nof these new Christians. In the wake of Soviet collapse they found themselves marginalized, in a \nsociety that was partly alien to them. In Kyrgyzstan conversion was often a reaching out to new \nhorizons in order to escape the destitute socio-economic situation or to overcome a personal crisis, \ncrossing ethnic and religious boundaries in order to undo exclusionary social effects and gain entrance \ninto a new moral community. In the case of Ajaria, the sentiment of \u2018the border that crossed us\u2019 was \neven more widespread. In order to go back to where they felt they belonged, they not only had to try to \ncross that out-of-place boundary, their conversion was also an attempt to erase that boundary. \n \nReferences \nAbramzon, S.

It is worth noting that a large portion of Batumi\u2019s population are Georgians with Christian background. \n2\n According to Father Meriani there were 250 baptized Christians in Khulo in 2001 (5 percent of the population). \n3\n I have replaced the names of most informants with pseudonyms in order to guarantee their anonymity. I have \nmade an exception for the clergy of the Georgian Orthodox Church, as these are public figures operating under \nthe auspices of a well-established Georgian institution. \n4\n Fieldwork in Ajaria was carried out from 1997-2001 and fieldwork in Kyrgyzstan in 2003 and 2004. \n5\n Since I don\u2019t have enough space in this article to discuss the history of Soviet repression and cooptation of \nreligion and its effect on on subsequent possibilities for post-Soviet religious expression, I refer for Georgia to \nDragadze (1993) and Pelkmans (2006), and for Kyrgyzstan and Central Asia more broadly to Hann and \nPelkmans (2009), McBrien and Pelkmans (2008) and Khalid (2006). \n6\n Nock uses the word \u2018frontier\u2019 instead of \u2018boundary\u2019 in his formulation, but he does so in a manner that \ncorresponds more closely to contemporary anthropological uses of the term \u2018boundary\u2019. The differences between \nboth concepts will be discussed below and I have used the latter term here in order to avoid confusion.   \n7\n The \u2018Pauline model\u2019 of conversion refers to the biblical story of Saul, persecutor of Christians, who on his way \nto Damascus had a spiritual encounter with Jesus. After this encounter he took on the name Paul and started his \nmissionary work (See Acts 9: 1-19) \n8\n Tim Ingold, \u201ckeynote speech\u201d at BOREAS workshop: Heading North, Heading South: Arctic Social Sciences \nResearch in Global Perspective\u201d, 6-9 March, 2008. \n9\n Without speculating on such predictions, it is noteworthy that in towns located closer to the regional capital \nBatumi, a much larger portion of the Muslim population had converted to Christianity by the early 2000s. \n 25 \n                                                                                                                                                                                     \n10\n Kyrgyzstan\u2019s secular authorities hardly interfered with the activities of the CJC in the first ten years of its \nexistence, but after its membership grew to over 10,000 it met with increasing opposition from the government. \nLikewise, Muslim leaders became increasingly active in trying to win converts back after 2000, at least partly in \nresponse to the successes of evangelical churches. \n11\n The specificities of the research settings contributed to this outcome. Not only were these post-Soviet contexts \nin which religion had obtained many political connotations, but relatively small towns in which the density of \ninterpersonal ties guaranteed that social control was a force to be reckoned with. In Batumi with its more diverse \npopulation as well as in Kyrgyzstan\u2019s capital Bishkek I came across more people who, at least for a while, acted \nas \u2018postmodern\u2019 consumers picking and choosing from the various religions and denominations at offer. \n12\n This thought is informed by Berdahl\u2019s suggestion that in the borderlands ambiguity tends to create clarity \n(1999: 232) and Gupta and Ferguson\u2019s suggestion that \u2018as actual places and localities become ever more blurred \n\u2026. ideas of culturally and ethnically distinct places become perhaps even more salient\u2019 (1992). \n13\n Discussions of boundaries discuss whether they are rigid, flexible, porous, or dissipating, but the location of \nthese lines in social, territorial, or cultural space is often taken for granted. This reveals a Barthian (1969) legacy \nas his aim was to understand boundary maintenance through cross-boundary communication, and said very little \nabout the qualitative changes in, or shifts of, those boundaries (see also Pelkmans 2006: 12-13, 45-46). \n14\n I dwell on this point because of the tendency to see conversion as incomplete and usual gradual work-in-\nprogress (for example Austin-Broos 2003; Coleman 2003), which risks overlooking or ignoring experiences of \ndiscontinuity and rupture (See also Robbins (2007) criticism of anthropology\u2019s \u2018continuity-thinking\u2019). \n15\n The origin of this slogan is unclear. Luna-Firebaugh (2002) used it with reference to Latin-speakers in the U.S. \nsouthern states, and various websites suggest that the slogan has caught on among \u2018immigrant-rights\u2019 groups. \n"}
