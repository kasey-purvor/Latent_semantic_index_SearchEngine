Most evidence comes from limb praxis however; \nthe link between oral motor control and speech and language has been neglected, despite the \nfact that most language users talk with their mouths. Oral motor control is affected in a variety \nof developmental disorders, including Down Syndrome. However, its development is poorly \nunderstood. We investigated oral motor control in three groups: adults with acquired aphasia, \nindividuals with developmental dysphasia, and typically developing children. In individuals with \nspeech and language difficulties, oral motor control was impaired. More complex movements \nand sets of movements were even harder for individuals with language impairments. In typically \ndeveloping children (21-24 months), oral motor control was found to be related to language skills. \nIn both studies, a closer relationship was found between language and complex oral movements \nthan simple oral movements. This relationship remained when the effect of overall cognitive ability \nwas removed.  Children who were poor at oral movements were not good at language, although \nchildren who were good at oral movements could fall anywhere on the distribution of language \nabilities. Oral motor skills may be a necessary precursor for language skills.\nKeywords:\nEvidence for a link between motor \ncontrol and language\nIn examining the relationship between motor control and \nlanguage development and disorders, there is a contrast \nbetween the large amount that is known about limb motor \ncontrol and the small amount that is known about oral \nmotor control. For example, it has long been known that \nthe fi rst stages of language development occur in parallel \nwith the fi rst stages of gesture development, and that chil-\ndren whose fi rst gestures are earlier than average usually \nalso say their fi rst words earlier than average (Bates et al., \n1979). Recent data also show that children who are late \nin the onset of both spontaneous communicative gesture \nand spoken language are more likely to remain delayed than \nthose who start making communicative gestures at a typi-\ncal age but whose speech is also delayed (Thal et al., 1997). \nThere is also a strong association between limb motor \ncontrol diffi culties and language impairment (Hill, 2001), \nwhich appear to share a common genetic basis (Bishop, \n2002). This imbalance in research exists despite the fact \nthat the majority of language users speak, rather than sign. \nWe now turn to work on the development of oral motor \nskills. \nOral motor development\nThere has been little work to date on how oral motor con-\ntrol develops in children, and much of this has been con-\ncentrated on the feeding behaviour of young infants or \ndevelopmentally disabled children (a selection of recent \nwork includes Fucile et al., 2005; Johnson & Harris, 2004; \nMason et al., 2005; Rogers & Arvedson, 2005), with no \ninvestigation of any possible link to language develop-\nment. Some studies purporting to examine oral motor con-\ntrol and language focus on diadochokinesis, the ability to \nrepeat speech syllables as fast as possible, which seems to \nstray from the defi nition of nonverbal oral motor skill, and \nwhich also has questionable value in diagnosis of oral praxis \ndiffi culties (Yaruss & Logan, 2002).\nGiven this background, we are not yet sure, for example, \nwhen children might reach adult functional levels of oral \nmotor skill. For example, Landt and Ingervall (1975) sug-\ngest that an adult level of skill may not be reached by 11 \nyears, while more speech-like aspects of development may \n2\nDown Syndrome Research and Practice 10(x), xx-xx\n\u00a9 2006 The Down Syndrome Educational Trust.

Alcock \u2022 Oral movements and language\nreach their adult level around 14 years (Smith & Zelaznik, \n2004). In contrast, other authors suggest that mature skill \nlevels may be reached at a much younger age (Stark & \nBlackwell, 1997).\nAssociations in disorders\nMuch of the research into the relationship between non-\nverbal oral motor control and language development has \nbeen inspired by a multiplicity of studies showing that \nlanguage dysfunction and oral motor dysfunction often \noccur together. My own research shows similar patterns of \nimpairment in developmental and acquired verbal dyspraxia \n(Alcock et al., 2000b, see also details below). Indeed, \ngenerally acquired oral dyspraxia and acquired nonfl uent \ndysphasia are found to be associated (Mateer & Kimura, \n1977). Although dissociations between these two have \nbeen found (Masdeu & O\u2019Hara, 1983), the association is \ncommon enough to suggest a link of some kind; dissocia-\ntions in adult acquired dysfunction do not necessarily sug-\ngest modularity in development (Karmiloff-Smith, 1998). \nOral motor skill is found to be impaired in many develop-\nmental disorders where spoken language is also impaired: it \nis commonly impaired in autism (Adams, 1998; Amato & \nSlavin, 1998; Page & Boucher, 1998); oral motor diffi cul-\nties are more commonly found in autistic children than limb \nmotor diffi culties. Oral motor control has frequently been \nfound to be impaired in Down syndrome, and this seems \nto stem not just from oral weaknesses but to involve some \ndegree of dyspraxia (Kumin & Adams, 2000; Kumin & \nBahr, 1999; Spender et al., 1995). In children with specifi c \nlanguage impairment (SLI), very few studies have looked \nat oral motor control but in those that have, associations \nhave been found. For example, Stark and Blackwell (1997) \nfound that oral motor skills were associated with both non-\nword repetition and phoneme identifi cation in SLI. \nThere has in particular been a suggestion that develop-\nmental verbal dyspraxia cannot exist without nonverbal, \noral dyspraxia (Stackhouse & Snowling, 1992). With these \nassociations in mind, study 1 investigated the oral motor \nabilities of a group of individuals with a developmental \nspeech and language impairment, the KE family.\nStudy 1 \u2013 Oral motor control in \ndevelopmental and acquired speech \nand language impairment\nSpecifi c speech and language impairment seems to occur \nin between 2-7% of children, who have no global learn-\ning disability, sensory impairment, or social impairment \nsuch as an autistic spectrum disorder, which might explain \ntheir language delay. Strictly speaking, individuals with SLI \nshould have nonverbal IQ in the normal range. There is \nmuch evidence that SLI can be genetic and the KE family \nfollows this pattern. This family has around 30 members \nin three generations of whom 50% have a speech and lan-\nguage impairment, and the pattern of inheritance seems to \nbe dominant, with full penetrance (Fisher et al., 1998).\nThe KE family\u2019s language skills were fi rst reported by \nGopnik and Crago (1991), who suggested they had specifi c \nproblems with formation of regular past tense forms, and in \nparticular that they had no signifi cant articulation problem \npast childhood; Pinker (1995) went on to claim that the \nfamily did not resemble adult aphasic individuals in their \nlanguage or other abilities. However, Vargha-Khadem et \nal., (1995) found that affected family members had diffi -\nculty with both regular and irregular past tense, that other \ngrammatical structures impaired, as well as most other tests \nof speech and language, and that affected family members \nhad lower IQ scores than unaffected family members. \nThese fi ndings suggested that nonverbal skills might also \nbe affected. In addition to oral motor skill (Alcock et al., \n2000b), musical pitch and timing skills were investigated \n(Alcock et al., 2000a). Because of the common fi nding of \noral motor diffi culties in individuals with acquired speech \nand language impairment, a group of such individuals, with \nacquired left hemisphere (LH) lesions, were included. In \naddition, there was the possibility that there might be some \nbilateral neural defi cits in affected family members, and \nindeed evidence has emerged for this (Watkins et al., 2002), \nas well as for some right hemisphere involvement in oral \npraxis (Bizzozero et al., 2000). A group of individuals with \nanalogous acquired right hemisphere (RH) lesions were \ntherefore included. Eleven affected family members (mean \nage 21.1, s.d. 15.7) were compared to 56 age-matched con-\ntrols (mean age 25.8, s.d. 20.8), and likewise older adults \nwith acquired unilateral lesions (nine LH, mean age 57.44, \ns.d. 18.27, ten RH, mean age 63.00, s.d. 7.52) were com-\npared with 23 older age- and years-of-education-matched \ncontrols (mean age 61.96, s.d. 10.28).\nTest details\nThe oral motor tasks used here are administered by a tester \nseated opposite the participant, who videotapes the test-\ning session for later scoring. Each set of movements is fi rst \nadministered to command and secondly to imitation. There \nare four sets of movements: Simple movements, involving \nonly one set of muscles (example: open the mouth); Com-\nplex movements involving more than one set of muscles \n(example: whistle); Temporal sequences of movements, \ninvolving three movements, one after the other (exam-\nple: fi rst open the mouth, then stick out the tongue, then \nsay \u201cAh\u201d); Parallel (or simultaneous) movements, involv-\ning three movements simultaneously (example: all at the \nsame time, open the mouth, stick out the tongue, and say \n\u201cAh\u201d). \nResults\nDetails of the differences between affected family mem-\nbers, individuals with acquired unilateral lesions, and age-\nmatched controls can be found in Alcock et al., (2000b). \nIn summary, the affected family members performed worse \noverall, and even worse on the more complex conditions \n\u2013 single complex movements, and combinations of move-\nments. Imitation aided performance for all subjects and \n3\nDown Syndrome Research and Practice 10(x), xx -xx\n\u00a9 2006 The Down Syndrome Educational Trust. All Rights Reserved.

Alcock \u2022 Oral movements and language\naided performance more on the more complex conditions \nbut the effect of this was no different for the affected family \nmembers than for the age-matched controls. The same pat-\ntern of results was seen for the participants with acquired \naphasia. The individuals with acquired RH lesions per-\nformed more poorly than age-matched controls, but not \neven more poorly on harder movements. There was no dif-\nference between affected family members and age-matched \ncontrols on simple, single movements performed either to \nimitation or command, and likewise the individuals with \nacquired aphasia performed at the same level as controls \non these simple, single movements to imitation but more \npoorly to command. The performance of the two language-\nimpaired groups and the age-matched controls can be seen \nin Figure 1.\nDiscussion\nOverall the affected family members are impaired in their \nperformance of oral movements \u2013 apart from simple single \nmovements. The harder the movements become, the larger \nthe difference between the participants with either devel-\nopmental or acquired language impairments, and their con-\ntrol subjects. The pattern of impairment for the two groups \nis very similar. This impairment is unlikely to be due to \nlanguage comprehension diffi culties, as movements which \nwere imitated were impaired as well as those that were \nperformed to command; imitation improved performance \nequally for all subjects, not differentially for those with lan-\nguage diffi culties.\nFrom this, and other data (Alcock et al., 2000a), it can \nbe seen that the affected family members have pervasive \nnonverbal defi cits, as well as their wide-ranging language \ndiffi culties. Although the majority of family members do \nhave IQ scores within the typical range, and could there-\nfore be classifi ed as having specifi c language impairment, \nthis family is not entirely similar to many individuals with \nSLI, in that some affected family members have lower IQ \nscores and could not necessarily be classifi ed as having spe-\ncifi c language impairment, and also in that most affected \nfamily members (Gopnik & Crago, 1991 notwithstanding) \ncan be clearly identifi ed by most listeners as having speech \ncoordination diffi culties \u2013 as being dyspraxic. This very \nobvious diffi culty is not found in many older children and \nadults with a history of SLI, who nonetheless have real dif-\nfi culties with language. However, some studies fi nd that \nchildren who have an identifi able speech impairment when \nthey are younger can go on to have solely \u2018language\u2019 dif-\nfi culties when they are older (Felsenfeld et al., 1992; Lewis\net al., 2004). Although it may be possible to identify more \nolder children and adults who have similar concurrent lan-\nguage diffi culties and oral motor diffi culties, it may be that \nthese oral motor diffi culties are more likely to be found in \nyounger children, and it is also possible that these could be \nthe precursor to a language diffi culty. This possibility led \nto study 2.\nStudy 2 \u2013 Oral motor control in \ntypical language development\nBackground\nThe average age at which children undergo a burst in \nvocabulary development, and start to combine words into \nsentences, is 21 months (Bates et al., 1995). As this is the \nfastest point of development, and the point of greatest indi-\nvidual differences, this is an ideal time-point at which to \nexamine individual differences in oral motor and language \nskill.\nBriefl y, a variety of explanations have been put forward \nfor the sudden increase in vocabulary development and its \nassociation with grammatical development. Werker et al., \n(2002) suggest that an improvement in word perception \nmay lead to this change, whereas Naigles (1990) hypoth-\nesise that syntax assists word learning. The idea that the \nsame neural network underlies both grammatical and lexi-\ncal development is put forward by Elman et al. (1996), and \nin a similar explanation, Bates and Goodman (1997) argue \nthat grammar is part of lexicon so that children necessarily \nlearn both together. It is important therefore to examine \nassociations of oral motor control with both lexical and \ngrammatical development.\nWhat, then, do we know about associations between these \ntwo skills in typical development? There is in fact very little \ndata on this link. Moore and Ruark (Moore & Ruark, \nFigure 1.

Alcock \u2022 Oral movements and language\n1996) used EMG recordings to examine the coordination \nof activity in feeding behaviour and speech motor behav-\niour, and suggested that these were not linked. However, \nthe types of motor activity examined in the non-speech \ncategory in this study were mainly those involving a single \nset of muscles \u2013 opening and closing the mouth, chewing \netc. \u2013 which were not found to be impaired in individu-\nals with language impairments in Study 1. A small body of \nresearch fi nds immature oromotor function and immature \nspeech processes diffi cult if not impossible to separate, even \nup to 10 years (Qvarnstrom et al., 1994). We set out to \ninvestigate this link further. If such a link is found at the \ntime of the vocabulary burst, would it, as with associations \nwith language disorders, be dependent on the diffi culty of \nthe movements used? Would there be any particular asso-\nciation with vocabulary, or with grammar? Would such a \nlink merely be dependent on some level of general maturity, \nwhich might also be shown in gross motor development, or \nin cognitive development?\nTest and participant details\nAs in Study 1, a test was devised which involved the experi-\nmenter sitting with the child and videoing their movements \nfor later scoring. At this young age, however, children are \nnot capable of responding to instructions involving oral \nmovements so the movements were all demonstrated by the \nexperimenter, and where possible props were provided to \nhelp the child understand what was required as part of the \nmovement. Again, simple movements involving only one \nset of muscles (example: opening the mouth, with a puppet \nto copy) and complex movements involving more than one \nset of muscles (example: licking the lips, with honey to \nlick off the lips) were used. Speeded, repeated movements \n(example: open and close the mouth as fast as possible, cop-\nying the puppet) were also used, although sequences and \ncombinations of movements were not used with this age \ngroup. Children\u2019s language skills were assessed using the \nMacarthur-Bates CDI (Fenson et al., 1994), which parents \ncomplete, and which includes questions directed at chil-\ndren\u2019s expressive vocabulary and at their use of increasingly \ncomplex word combinations and grammatical morphemes. \nCognitive development was assessed using the Parent-based \nAssessment of Cognitive Abilities (PARCA - Saudino et \nal., 1998), and gross motor development using the Bayley \nScales of Infant Development (Bayley, 1993).\nTwenty-four infants aged 20.5 to 21.5 months were assessed, \n(mean = 21.1, s.d. = .25, comprising \n18 boys 6 girls). The infants were \nrecruited from the local maternity \nward at birth for infant research, and \nwere all full term, with no diagnosis \nof developmental disorder or hearing \nloss, and with English the only lan-\nguage spoken in the home. \nResults\nThe overall correlation between the total score on the oral \nmotor battery and the total vocabulary as measured on the \nCDI was not signifi cant (r = .293). However, complex, \nsimple, and repeated movements had different relationships \nto language skills in previous studies (Alcock & Gordon, \n2002; Alcock et al., 2000b), and a specifi c relationship \nbetween grammatical vocabulary and oral motor skill was \nalso found in previous research with typically developing \n24-month olds (Alcock & Gordon, 2002). Table 1 shows \nthe correlations between content words, function words, \nand complexity (a rough measure of MLU), and scores for \nsimple, complex, and repeated movements. It can be seen \nthat the score for complex oral movements correlates sig-\nnifi cantly with all measures of language. Figure 2 shows \nthe relationship between complex oral motor skill and total \nvocabulary.\nIt could be possible, however, that this correlation is due to \na general maturity or cognitive ability factor: children who \nare good at language are also good at everything else. In \nfact, oral motor skills correlate signifi cantly with the child\u2019s \nscore on the Bayley Scales (Motor) (r = .517, p = .011). \nHowever, Bayley (Motor) scores do not correlate signifi -\ncantly with children\u2019s vocabularies (r = .172, p > .05).\nOral motor skills also correlate signifi cantly with children\u2019s \nscores on the PARCA (r = .564, p = .005), and the correla-\ntion between the PARCA and total vocabulary approaches \nsignifi cance (r = .406, p = .061). However, linear regression \nshows that oral motor skill still has a signifi cant relation-\nship with vocabulary when the effect of PARCA scores is \nremoved (t = 2.54, d.f. = 2, 19, p = .019) \nIt can be seen from Figure 2 that lower levels of oral motor \nskill almost invariably correspond to lower levels of lan-\nguage, while children with higher levels of oral motor skill \nhave a range of language skills. This relationship was con-\nfi rmed with a Chi-square test looking at the numbers of \nchildren who fell above and below 100 words on the CDI \nand a score of 50% on the complex oral movements tasks \n(Chi-sq = 4.02, d.f. = 1, p = .045)\nTable 1 \u2013 Correlations between oral motor skill and language use\nTotal content \nwords used\nTotal function \nwords used\nSentence \ncomplexity score\nOral motor total score 0.266 0.361 0.225\nComplex oral movements \ntotal score 0.495* 0.531* 0.452*\nRepeated movements \ntotal score -0.251 -0.155 -0.326\n* p < .05\n5\nDown Syndrome Research and Practice 10(x), xx -xx\n\u00a9 2006 The Down Syndrome Educational Trust.

Alcock \u2022 Oral movements and language\nDiscussion\nStudy 2 shows that language and oral motor skill are linked \nin normal development; this is a replication and extension of \nvery similar fi ndings in a previous study with children aged \n24 months (Alcock & Gordon, 2002). This link is sepa-\nrate from the link between cognitive and language abilities, \nand is highly relevant for theories of language impairment: \nif poor oral motor skill can contribute to poor language, \nregardless of a child\u2019s cognitive skill, for some children who \nappear to have cognitive skill in the typical range, poor oral \nmotor skill could lead to poor speech and language skills.\nThere are a number of explanations for this link. It may \nbe that children who have good imitation abilities perform \nwell on both language tests and oral motor tests. In this \nstudy, language and cognitive skills were not assessed in \nthe laboratory but by the parent, based on their observation \nof the child\u2019s language at home. These measures therefore \ndid not depend directly on imitative ability, but language \nskill is still associated with oral motor skill, and to some \nextent with cognitive ability. Gross motor skill, in contrast, \nwas assessed in the laboratory using both imitation and \ncommand to elicit movements, yet did not correlate with \nlanguage. In addition, not all imitated movements had a \nrelationship with language: in Study 1, simple, single move-\nments performed to imitation were not impaired even in \nthe most severely aphasic individuals; and in Study 2, the \nsame simple movements did not show a signifi cant relation-\nship to language ability.\nIn our previous study (Alcock & Gordon, 2002), a stronger \nrelationship was found between oral motor skill and gram-\nmatical morphemes and words, than between oral motor \nskill and content words. In the current study the correlation \nwas also slightly higher between complex oral movements \nand function words than content words. This is interesting \ngiven the particular diffi culties reported by some observ-\ners with grammatical parts of speech, by children with SLI \n(Van der Lely, 1993) One possible explanation for this \nparticular fi nding is that function words, and grammatical \nmorphemes, are generally shorter words in English, as well \nas being unstressed. Where, say, a child can pronounce less \nthan half the phonemes in a word, and that word has several \nphonemes (e.g. \u201celephant\u201d), the result (e.g.\/\u03b5f\u0259\/) will be \nmore comprehensible if the word has three phonemes (e.g. \n\u201cthat\u201d), and the child can only pronounce one (e.g.\/?\u00e6\/). \nParents may thus miss those attempts at shorter words a \nchild is in fact making. Alternatively, children could be \naware of their less intelligible attempts at words, and could \nmiss out shorter words where they fi nd their own produc-\ntions are not as close to the target.\nConclusions\nPrevious studies of the link between oral motor skills and \nlanguage have tended to look at simple movements more \nclosely resembling eating movements (Moore & Ruark, \n1996), or fast repeated movements (Dworkin & Culatta, \n1985), neither of which seem to have a relationship with \nlanguage development and disorders in these two studies. \nOur data suggest that more diffi cult oral movements are \nmore closely related to language skills, possibly because \nthey are more speech-like. \nFrom these results, it seems that children who are poor at \noral movements before they are two years old are also poor \nat language skills at the same age. Children who are good at \noral motor skills may however be anywhere on the spectrum \nof language use. This implies that oral motor skills are a \nnecessary, but not suffi cient, prerequisite for good language \nskills. It is possible that this will translate into prediction \nof later language use by earlier oral motor skills \u2013 planned \nfollow-up of the same children when they are three years \nold will be able to tell us if this is the case. In addition, we \nneed to know more about how oral motor skills develop in \nyoung children, before we can investigate further the link \nbetween oral motor skills and language development and \nimpairments.\nAcknowledgements\nStudy 1 was supported by an MRC PhD studentship to \nthe author, and was carried out as part of my DPhil thesis \nat Oxford University.
