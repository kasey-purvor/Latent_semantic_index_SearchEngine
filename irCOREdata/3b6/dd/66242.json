Introduction \n \nA blockmodel is a description of the structural relations between \na number of objects. For example, the objects may be people \nand the relations \u201clike\u201d or \u201ctalk to\u201d. The problem of describing \nthe relations may be seen as part of structural modelling \n(Harary, Norman and Cartwright, 1965; Lendaris, 1980; Hage \nand Harary, 1983) or social network analysis (Wasserman and \nFaust, 1997; Scott, 2000). The purpose of the model is to define \ngroups of objects that exhibit a high degree of \ninterconnectedness, and in this sense is a form of cluster \nanalysis. Two model forms may be distinguished: that in which \nan object may belong to only one of a number of disjoint groups, \nand that in which there is no such restriction and so the groups \nmay overlap. Although nomenclature varies a little groups of the \nfirst type are generally called blocks and those of the second \ntype are called cliques. Although what follows is concerned with \nblockmodels it may be noted that cliques have for some time \nbeen of interest in sociometry (Luce, 1950; Harary and Ross, \n1957; Arabie, 1977) and in the analysis of design problems \n(Alexander, 1964; Chermayeff and Alexander, 1966; Elms, \n1983) in which application a relation exists if the solution \nchosen for one object influences the choice of solution for \nanother. The sociometric concept of a clique requires, quite \nnaturally, that an individual will in general be a member of a \nnumber of cliques and that position and power are in part a \nresult of this multiple membership. Again, in the dissagregation \nof a design problem into smaller, and so more easily resolved, \nsub-problems it is thought reasonable that an object \u2013 a door, say \n\u2013 will form part of more than one sub-problem and that this \n \n~  2  ~ \nshould be recognised in the disaggregation. Whether this overlap \nhas much practical use remains an open question. Clique \ndetection methods rely heavily on network theoretic results, as \ndo structural modelling methods in general. \n \n \n2. Blockmodels \n \nRelations between objects are encoded as either present or not. \nThis may be inherent in the nature of the relation, \u201cfather of\u201d, \nfor instance, or it may be arrived at by applying a cutoff level to \na continuous measure such as a correlation coefficient. The \nrelations need not be symmetric. A block may be visualised as a \ngroup of nodes in a network which are highly interconnected or, \nequivalently, as a high density region of the incidence matrix \nobtained by rearrangement of the rows and columns. Most of the \nblockmodel methods refer primarily to the matrix idea though \nsome are based on network models (e.g. Everett, 1982). The \nrationale of the blockmodel relies on the idea of structural \nequivalence. Two objects are structurally equivalent if they have \nthe same pattern of interaction with all objects in the set. Ideally \nall such equivalent objects are grouped into a block and in doing \nso no information is lost. In practice this ideal is unachievable \nand so some acceptably good approximate blocking must be \nachieved. \n \nThe blockmodel approach was introduced by White, Boorman \nand Breiger (1976). Overviews are given by Arabie, Boorman \nand Levitt (1978), Light and Mullins (1979) and in Wasserman \nand Faust (1997) and Scott (2000). These authors also provide \nnumerous examples of application, primarily sociological in \nnature. In general, there may be more than one relation to be \nconsidered (\u201clikes\u201d and \u201chelps\u201d, say) and there are two ways of \nconstructing a model in this situation. First, each relation may be \n \n~  3  ~ \nmodelled separately and the results compared to identify if two \nor more patterns of interrelation are practically the same \n(multiplexity). Second, the criterion underlying the blockmodel \nmay be extended to calculate just one partition for all relations \n(e.g. as by Boorman and Levitt, 1983). The method described in \nthis paper will be for a single relation but the application to \neither of these cases will be obvious. \n \nTo state the problem formally, consider a binary network X of n \nnodes in which xij = 1 if the relation being studied exists \nbetween the objects represented as nodes i and j and 0 if it does \nnot. It is not usual that diagonal elements have any meaningful \ninterpretation and so, solely for convenience in what follows, let \nxii  = 1. \n \nNodes are partitioned into m sets or blocks (m \u2264 n) via the \nmembership matrix \u039b in which \u03bbik = 1 if node i is in block k and \n0 if it is not. Each node must belong to just one block and so \n \n \u2211 \u03bbik  =  1    ;    \u2200 i     (1) \n  k \n \nThe number of nodes in block k is \n \n sk  =  \u2211 \u03bbik       (2) \n           i \n \nThe density matrix, D, describes interactions between the m \nblocks as the proportion of possible inter-block links realised in \nthe network. Typically , for blocks k and l, the maximum \nnumber of inter-block connections is sksl and so the inter-block \ndensity is  \n \n dkl  =  \u2211\u2211 xij\u03bbik\u03bbjl  \/ sksl     (3) \n            i  j \n \n~  4  ~ \nA special case is the intra-block density, or just block density,  \n \n dkk  =  \u2211\u2211 xij\u03bbik\u03bbjk  \/ sk2    (4) \n            i  j \nFrom the density matrix, D, may be derived a binary matrix \ncalled an image matrix, Y, via a cutoff value \u03b1: \n \n ykl  = 1 if dkl \u2265 \u03b1 \n      = 0 otherwise     (5) \n \nIf \u03b1=0 the result is a \u201czeroblock\u201d or lean fit image, since only \nfor zero densities will the density and image be the same. \nSimilarly, if \u03b1=1 the result is a \u201coneblock\u201d or fat fit. Other \nvalues are called \u03b1-fit images. A convenient value for \u03b1 is the \ndensity of the whole matrix X so that the image matrix shows \nthose inter-block densities above and below the mean. This last \nstage is not always required, as will be the case in the \nillustrations below. \n \nConstruction of a blockmodel requires the determination of the \npartition \u039b. \n \nMeasured by the number of published applications the two most \npopular methods of blockmodel construction are BLOCKER and, \nparticularly, CONCOR described by Light and Mullins (1979) as \nbeing respectively deductive and inductive. BLOCKER (Heil and \nWhite, 1976) requires that an hypothesised structure (image) is \nprovided as input and then seeks permutations of the network to \ngive best fit solutions. The hypothesis is justified a priori by \nreference to some body of theory outwith BLOCKER. However, it \nis not often that such a hypothesis is available, rather it is \nrequired that some structure inherent in the data is revealed by \nthe analysis. CONCOR (Breiger, Boorman and Arabie, 1975) does \njust this by a process of repeated correlation. The calculations \n \n~  5  ~ \nare observed to lead to a useable result in that blocks are \nproduced but by a process with no theoretical justification. \nSchwartz (1977) criticised the method as being obscure and a \npoor substitute for a principle component analysis. Despite these \nreservations CONCOR continues to be used, for example by \nGerlach (1992) in his study of corporate relations in Japan. \n \nAn alternative, and in principle a more straightforward, strategy \nis to find some criterion for model performance and then a \nblockmodel which is optimal. Such criteria may be of two types: \nthose which measure the goodness of fit of model to data and \nthose which describe some characteristic of the blockmodel \nstructure. \n \nAlternative measures of goodness of fit are described by, among \nothers, Arabie, Boorman and Levitt (1978), Carrington and Heil \n(1979) and Wasserman and Faust (1997: Ch. 16) as ways of \ndescribing the adequacy of the description provided by the \nmodel of the data after the blocks have been constructed. As a \ncriterion for block construction the COBLOC algorithm proposed \nby Carrington and Heil (1981) uses a chi-squared measure to \ncompare the density and image matrices, D and Y, as the basis \nfor a hierarchical clustering procedure giving partitions of \nvarying coarseness wherein the clusters are determined by the \nmeasure. Panning (1982) takes the values of the image matrix as \npredictors of the interactions in the data matrix, X, and uses the \ncorrelation between elements in these two n \u00d7 n matrices as a \nmeasure of goodness of fit to be optimised, and shows that in \nthis case blockmodelling is equivalent to regression. \n \nWhile choosing a model to maximise goodness of fit is a \ncommon enough approach to model building generally, it will \nalways be more satisfactory if the model is derived from some \n \n~  6  ~ \nother considerations and the goodness of fit calculated only after \nthe model is formed. \n \nIn one sense an ideal of a block structure is a rearrangement of \nmatrix rows and columns to create a high density diagonal band. \nKatz (1947) takes this idea and uses the distance (number of \ncells) that an interaction lies above or below the diagonal. The \nsum of squares of these distances, \u03a3\u03a3xij(i-j)2, provides a function \nto be minimised in constructing the partition. Beum and \nBrundage (1950) give an alternative algorithm for the same \nobjective. \n \nThe goal of Boorman and Levitt (1983) is to determine that \npartition which separates as effectively as possible high density \nfrom low density regions. To this end they maximise the \nweighted sum of squares of block densities from the mean \ndensity, or densities if more than one relation is being modelled \nsimultaneously. \n \n \n3. Concentration \n \nJust as Boorman and Levitt had separation as a motivating idea \nfor block construction so we propose a criterion based upon the \nblocks themselves: that we prefer large dense blocks. Large \nblocks are those which have a large number of members, \ntypically sk for block k. The extent to which a size distribution \ntends to a small number of large blocks has long been studied by \nindustrial economists when looking at the degree of \nconcentration in an economy, in particular the consideration of \nthe distribution of sizes of firms in a sector. A popular measure \nis the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (Herfindahl, 1950; \nHirschman, 1964), HHI, which is just the sum of squares of the \n \n~  7  ~ \nsize of each firm. In this formulation size is expressed as a \nproportion of the whole so that concentration indices for sectors \nof different absolute size may be compared. When considering \nthe distribution of block sizes this total, the total number of \nobjects in the system, is the same for all possible block \nconfigurations and so we may use just the sum of squared block \nsizes: \n \nHHI  =  \u2211 sk2      (6) \n               k \n \nThe value of this index increases with increased concentration \nand so we seek a blockmodel which maximises HHI. This \ncriterion may be justified on grounds of both parsimony and \nclarity in that we implicitly seek the smallest number of (large) \nblocks as a model. In so doing the most compact description is \nsought. \n \nAn acceptable density is set by requiring blocks to have a \ndensity no less than the parameter \u03b2, and so, from (4), \n \n \n \u2211\u2211 xij\u03bbik\u03bbjk  \/ sk2  \u2265  \u03b2     (7) \n  i  j \n \nSubstituting for sk from (2) gives the programme: \nchoose \u039b to maximise      \u2211 ( \u2211 \u03bbik )2 \n                               k     i \nsuch that           \u2211\u2211 xij\u03bbik\u03bbjk  - \u03b2( \u2211 \u03bbik )2   \u2265  0  ;  \u2200 k               (8) \n               i  j                       i \n \nand   \u2211 \u03bbik  =  1                    ;    \u2200 i \n               k  \n \n \n \n \n~  8  ~ \n4. Illustration 1: Elective choice \n \nThe most frequent application of blockmodel construction is the \nformation of socially interacting groups. As an example thirty \nMBA students were studied. On their programme each student \nmust choose five elective courses from sixteen offered. To the \nextent that students choose the same electives they may be said \nto constitute a block and knowledge of these blocks will help in \nthe understanding of common interests and so the structure of \nthe programme as experienced by the students. The number of \nelectives common to each pair of students was used to form the \nbinary relations by coding \n \n    xij  = 1  if students i and j have 3 or more electives in common \n          =  0 otherwise \n \nThe result of making maximum density blocks (\u03b2 = 1) using (8) \nis shown in Figure 1. Rows and columns represent students and \neach shaded cell represents an interaction (xij  = 1). The ten \nblocks are labelled A to J and their sizes given in the last column \nof Table 1. The concentration for this model is HHI = 136. The \nmain blocks may be described as: \n \n(A) Corporate   mainly interested in finance and \nstrategy \n(B) Marketeers  also an interest in finance and \nstrategy but with a stronger common \ninterest in marketing \n(C) Changers focus on change management and \nnegotiating \n(D) Entrepreneurs concerned with small business \nmanagement and entrepreneurship \n \n \n~  9  ~ \nBlock densities may be appreciated from Figure 1 and are also \ngiven in Table 1 from which it would be easy to make an image \nmatrix by choosing a cutoff value, but this is not the focus of \nthis paper. The blocks and their interaction as measured by the \ndensity matrix provide a structural description of the interests of \nthis group of students. That finance and strategy are important to \nMBA students is hardly a surprise and the analysis reflects this. \nThe small group of changers is perhaps less expected and may \nindicate a possible syllabus development. \n \n \n5.  Illustration 2: Performance ranking \n \nRanking according to aggregated performance measures is \nincreasingly popular, despite the practical difficulties frequently \nencountered: it is not uncommon that the constituent measures \nare chosen as much for their availability as for their desirability. \nIn addition, the relative importance given to each constituent is, \nthough sensible, usually somewhat arbitrary. This uncertainty \nabout weights must necessarily result in some doubt as to \nwhether, in all cases, those organisations being assessed really \ndo exhibit performances  significantly different from each other. \nDespite these problems such rankings will continue to be \npublished. We examine here the second difficulty; uncertainty \nabout weights. The difficulties surrounding the selection and \nmeasurement of appropriate characteristics, while real, do not \nundermine what follows as an illustration of blockmodel \nconstruction. \n \nThe Times annually publishes a ranking of the 97 British \nUniversities. The ranking published on 14th. April 2000 was \nbased on nine attributes: \n \n1.  Teaching quality assessment score \n \n~  10  ~ \n2.  Research assessment exercise score \n3.  A level score for entrants \n4.  Student \/ staff ratio \n 5.  Library and computer spending per student \n 6.  Spending on facilities per student \n 7.  Percentage graduating with a First or 2(i) \n 8.  Percentage finding employment within six months of \n                graduating \n 9.  Completion rate \n \nIn each case a total or mean was taken across all departments for \nthe whole university. Values were scaled as proportions of the \nmaximum score achieved for each attribute. The base measures \nall logically have a lower bound of zero which is never observed \nsince even the weakest institution can register some level of \nactivity. Consequently the more common scaling to a [0,1] scale \nvia a value function using maxima and minima found in the data \nis preferred and the results of both calculations are shown in \nTable 2 for the top twenty universities of The Times listing. \nEven this change has nontrivial effects: Warwick is elevated \nfrom ninth to fourth and King\u2019s falls from fifteenth to twentieth. \nHowever, the main purpose here is to examine the effects of \nuncertainty about weights. The Times gave teaching quality a \nrelative weight of 2.5, research 1.5 and the rest 1.0. For \ncalculation weights were found by scaling these relative values \nto sum to 1. Illustrative levels of uncertainty were modelled for \neach by a rectangular distribution with limits \u00b1 25% of the \nweight. The requirement that weights sum to 1 means that they \ncannot be treated as independent random variables and so \nsimulation was used to find the standardised difference, zij , for \neach pair, i and j, of universities: \n \n zij  =  (qi \u2013 qj) \/ \u03c3ij     (9) \n \n~  11  ~ \n where qi is the weighted aggregate score for university i and \u03c3ij \nis the standard deviation of the difference (qi \u2013 qj). The matrix Z \nis recoded to give X according to whether the difference is \nstatistically significant: \n \n xij  =  1  if  \u23d0zij\u23d0< z* \n       =  0 otherwise \n \nwhere z* is chosen to correspond to a given significance level. \nIn this example, conservatively, z* = 3. The  resulting \nblockmodel is shown in Figure 2 and Table 3 and in the last \ncolumn of Table 2.  \n \nRather than the strict ranking of the twenty universities only \nthree seem to be clearly distinct: Cambridge, Oxford and King\u2019s,  \nwith Imperial nearly so. These universities have performance \nlevels significantly different from all others. UCL and Lancaster \nare also distinctive. The three main blocks are, in performance \norder, \n \nWarwick, LSE, Bristol \nNottingham, Durham, Bath, York \nManchester, Sheffield, Birmingham, Newcastle, SOAS \n \nThese three blocks account for twelve of the twenty universities. \nTwo aspects of this structure are notable. First, the complete \nlack of interaction between the three blocks, suggesting that the \ndifferences between them are substantial. Second, that the size \nof the block increases, albeit slightly, as one moves down the list \nreflecting, perhaps, the distinctiveness of superior performers.  \n \n \n~  12  ~ \nMade in this way performance assessments are given in blocks \nof universities, the performance of the members of each being \nsensibly indistinguishable, together with some universities with \nperformance levels distinctly different from others. It is not \nuncommon for these singletons to be found at the head of a \nranking. Such a mix of blocks and singletons provides a more \nnatural articulation of performance differences than an uneasily \nenforced strict  ranking dependent, in part, upon spuriously \nprecise weights.  \n \n \n6.  Illustration 3: Recovering a known pattern \n \nClustering methods uncover structure but the structure \nuncovered depends in part on the method: it is not the structure \nwhich is found, rather a structure which is suggested. It is \ntherefore not possible to prove a method in the normal sense \nbecause that would require that a true structure was known in \nadvance, which could only occur with problems of such \nsimplicity that they provide no real test at all. Nonetheless, an \nillustration is offered in Figure 3. The data are artificial. The \nunderlying structure of three blocks and three singletons was \ndecided and then the noise provided by off-diagonal interactions \nadded in a haphazard way. The model successfully detected the \ninitial pattern. This small example may permit some confidence \nthat the method has value. \n \n \n7.  Computational note \n \nThe results discussed above were found as the solutions to the \nquadratic programme (8). Because this formulation is of a \nstandard form proprietary software may be used, and was here. \nAn alternative is provided by a heuristic based on the \n \n~  13  ~ \nconstruction of blocks, node by node, in decreasing order of \nblock size. Broadly, this is achieved by selecting at each stage \nthe node with the highest connectivity, Ci = \u03a3j xij. A full \ndescription is given by  Jessop (2002). Table 4 compares the \nresults given by the two methods. The solutions provided by the \nquadratic programme are, of course, not inferior. For the \nelectives data the solution is clearly superior to that given by the \nheuristic, giving larger blocks, a reduced number of singletons, \nand so a more compact description. For the university ranking \ndata the results are a little different in detail but give the same \nHHI and by the same distribution of block sizes: the optimum is \nnot unique. As can be seen from Figures 1 and 2 the electives \nmatrix is the more dense and so presents the opportunity of a \ngreater number of good, if not optimal, solutions, whereas for \nthe more sparse matrix these opportunities are necessarily fewer. \n \n \n8. Discussion \n \nThe method presented here provides a conceptually simple \ncriterion for the formation of blocks from a binary matrix of \ninteractions without the requirement for any prior specification \nof desired structure. There are a number of parameters which \nmust be set. First, the cutoff needed to obtain binary relations \nfrom some other measure of interaction; here the number of \nelectives, 3, and the value of standardised difference, also 3. \nSecond, the smallest level of density, \u03b2, permissible for block \nformation. Although this may at first appear to present a fine \nlevel of control, most of the cases presented for analysis \ncomprise, as do the two illustrations above, twenty or thirty \nobjects and this results in maximum block sizes of about six. In \nthese cases the changes to \u03b2 required to generate alternative \nblockmodels are likely to be somewhat coarse. In any case, the \n \n~  14  ~ \ninterpretation of blocks of less that maximum density may not \nalways be clear. It is likely that leaving \u03b2=1 and varying the \ncutoff value used to obtain the binary relations from the data \nwill give a more readily interpretable model. As a lower bound, \nand given the likely presence of two or more singletons,  it is \nnecessary to have \u03b2>0.5 to prevent the combination of two \nunconnected singletons into a spurious block. Third, the level \u03b1 \nrequired to form an image matrix in (5) must be set. This stage \nwas not used in the applications described above. Setting levels \nfor parameters may seem to be somewhat arbitrary but these \narticulations of judgement are unavoidable just as they are, for \ninstance, when determining confidence levels for statistical \ninference. \n \nIn some applications, notably the sociological, singletons, or \neven pairs, may not be acceptable for the very idea of a social \ngroup would seem to rule out these small blocks. On the other \nhand, it might be argued that identifying such people (objects) as \na first stage is itself useful, for while a group of one may be \nthought an oxymoron loners do exist. If it is thought desirable to \nimpose a minimum block size then this may be done using a \nstandard linear programming formulation (e.g. Wisniewski and \nDacre, 1990: Ch. 10). \n \nThe optimum may not be unique. Alternative optima may arise \nin two ways. First, different distributions of block sizes may \nhave the same value of HHI, as in the following mappings of \neighteen nodes into four blocks \u2013 [8,6,2,2] and [7,7,3,1] \u2013 which \nboth have HHI = 108. Using a power greater than two in the \nobjective function will resolve this in favour of distributions \nwith larger blocks; the first in this case. However high the power \nthis situation may still arise, though less frequently. Second, it \nmay be that the same distribution of block sizes arises through \n \n~  15  ~ \nmore than one assignment of objects to blocks, as was the case \nwith the two solutions to the universities model (Table 4). In this \ncase the differences were slight. The practical significance of the \nexistence of more than one optimum blocking will depend on \nthe application. If the purpose of the model is to provide a useful \ndisaggregation of a design problem into smaller sub-problems \nthen it is likely to be unimportant, for what is needed is a \ndisaggregation which is useful rather than in some strict sense \noptimal. If the purpose is to provide performance rankings then \nthe position of an organisation in those rankings, including the \nblock of which it is a member, may matter. All such analyses, \nwhichever method is used, contain, to some degree,  \nimprecisions and arbitrariness and as a result must be treated \nwith circumspection. The method described here is no different, \nthough the simplicity of formulation, being based on a clearly \nstated criterion, should assist in the interpretation of results. \n \n~  16  ~ \nReferences \n \nAlexander, C.
