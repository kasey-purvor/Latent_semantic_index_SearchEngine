Introduction \nA new generation of radiation sensors is required to improve on existing devices. Radiation \ndetectors are needed for particle physics experiments (1), dosimetry in medical radiotherapy (2), and \nfor security applications (3). Each of these applications has specific materials requirements that are \ndriving further development. \nMethods for the indirect detection of radiation rely on a secondary transduction method, such \nas the modulation or quenching of optical properties or scintillation in combination with a phosphor \nscreen (4). In the latter type of indirect detector, the scintillation light is absorbed by a \nphotoconductor or optical sensor that generate a signal. Of more practical use, and the topic of the \npresent work, is the direct detection of radiation. In this case, the radiation exposure induces a \nphotocurrent in a semiconducting material that can be correlated with the radiation dose in a \nquantitative way. Direct detectors have higher sensitivity, lower signal noise, and improved spatial \nresolution compared to scintillation detectors. On the other hand, indirect detectors typically have a \nmore complex and less efficient structure, particularly in medical dosimetry applications. \nSolid-state radiation sensors for the direct detection of radiation have conventionally used \neither scintillation crystals or inorganic semiconductors, such as silicon, as charge-based detectors \n(5, 6). In detectors for synchrotron or linear accelerators used by particle physicists, large areas in \ncurved geometries are needed. However, large-area, high quality inorganic crystals are expensive \nand difficult to manufacture. The detector is limited to sizes up to eight inches for silicon, as defined \nby the requirements of the electronics industry, but limited to much smaller dimensions for other, \nmore exotic crystalline materials.  \n In medical radiation dosimetry applications, on the other hand, there is a need for detectors \nthat have tissue equivalence for dose estimations to the human body and that minimise beam \nperturbations (7). This requirement means that the detectors must be comprised of the elements of \nhuman tissue, e.g. C, H and O. Inorganic semiconductors being applied in detectors, such as CdTe \nand ZnTe, are composed of heavy elements and hence are not tissue equivalent. Detectors that are in \nregular contact with humans must be made from materials that are not toxic. Hence, Cd-containing \n  \n4 \nmaterials are excluded from such applications. Furthermore, the high cost of single-crystal inorganic \nsemiconductors is also driving the development of alternative material for detectors and sensors. \nThere are specific performance requirements for radiation sensors that must be met by any \nnew material for direct radiation detection. The detector material should provide a low dark current \n(< 1 nA), good rectification behavior, and a high charge-carrier mobility. Clearly, the requirements \nfor sensor materials are demanding, yet conjugated polymers can potentially meet them.  \nDespite vibrant activity in the organic electronics field, the use of conjugated polymers for \nthe detection of ionizing radiation has received comparatively little attention from the community. \nConjugated polymers have, however, been used in indirect sensors of protons (8) and gamma \nradiation (9), and polymer photodiodes have been used for scintillation detectors for X-rays (10-12). \nIn comparison, semiconducting polymers are well established for use as the active element in \nelectronic devices, such as light emitting diodes (13), field effect transistors (14), photovoltaic cells \n(15) and chemical sensors (16). Polymers rival the performance of their inorganic semiconductor \nanalogues, especially with respect to display and lighting technology (17).  \nThe use of semiconducting polymers opens the possibility for large-area fabrication using \nlow-cost, wet processing techniques, such as spin-casting, spray casting, ink-jet or roll-to-roll \nprinting (18). Polymers are flexible and so can be flexed to create curved detector surfaces. Their \nelemental composition makes them tissue equivalent and non-toxic. Their cost is comparable to \nsome of the new inorganic semiconductor compositions.  \nYoshino et al. established the possibility of using conjugated polymers for radiation sensing \nby studying the effects of electron irradiation on the conductivity of iodine-doped poly(acetylene) at \nroom temperature (19). Recently, thick semiconducting polymer films have shown the potential of \ndirect detection of alpha (\u03b1) particles (20, 21). We have recently shown that a direct X-ray induced \nphotocurrent can be observed in metal\/polymer\/metal diode structures (22-24), thereby \ndemonstrating the feasibility of using conjugated polymers in direct real-time radiation detection \napplications. However, the performance stability, measurement repeatability, and signal quality of \nsuch polymeric sensors upon exposure to X-rays, have not yet been determined. The question \n  \n5 \nremains whether organic material-based sensors are suitable for solid-state radiation detection \napplications. More importantly, there is no clear design strategy in the materials selection for the \ndevelopment of high-performing sensors.      \n In this work, we have chosen a p-type poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) as the active material in \nmetal\/polymer\/metal semiconductor diodes because of its long-term environmental stability (14, 25) \nand its relatively high charge-carrier mobility (10-2 cm2\/(V s)) (26). The fabrication and \ncharacterization of prototype organic semiconductor sensors using thick PTAA films, for use as \ncharge-sensitive, direct-detection X-ray sensors, have already been presented (23, 24). Here, we \nhave investigated the effects of the choice of metal for the top electrode by comparing the results \nobtained from Al, Au, Ni and Pd.  We thereby develop a general approach for the materials selection \nfor metal contacts for organic-based sensors, which will form the basis for future device \ndevelopment for this application. The important parameters for device performance, including \ndevice stability, measurement repeatability and signal-to-noise ratio, are assessed in the prototype \nsensors. Moreover, we have gained an improved understanding of the process of charge injection \nand stable time response in polymer diodes, which has relevance to other polymeric devices, \nincluding sensors and photovoltaics. \n \n2. Experimental Details \nPTAA with weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of 31 kg\/mol and a polydispersity (PDI) \nindex (Mw\/Mn) of 2.07 was synthesized by a method described elsewhere in the literature (27). \nTransparent ITO-coated glass, with a sheet resistance of 25 \u2126 and a deposited ITO thickness of 80-\n120 nm, was obtained from Delta Technology Ltd., USA (CB-60IN). Aluminum wire (analytical \ngrade, 0.76 mm diameter, Fisher Scientific, UK), gold wire (0.2 mm diameter, Agar Scientific, UK), \nNi target, and Pd target were used for electrode preparation. Toluene (99.99% purity) was used as \nreceived (Sigma Aldrich). \n The details of the device preparation can be found elsewhere (23). In summary, a 5 wt% \nsolution of PTAA in toluene was spin-cast on top of the ITO providing a single polymeric active \n  \n6 \nlayer thickness of either 20 \u00b5m or 30 \u00b5m. In the present work, the interfacial layer of poly(3,4 \nethylene dioxythiophene): poly(styrene sulfonate) has been excluded from the diode structure, \nbecause it was found to have no effect on electrical properties in the devices. The PTAA films were \ninitially left to dry under atmospheric conditions and then annealed under vacuum at 150\u00b0C, which is \nabove the glass transition temperature of the polymer (Tg \u2248 103\u00b0C) (23), for 12 hours to eliminate \nany trapped solvent. The thickness profile of the active layer was subsequently measured using a \nsurface profilometer (Dektak, Veeco Instruments). To complete the diodes, either gold (Au) and \naluminum (Al) contacts (100 nm thick, 0.5 x 0.5 cm2) were thermally evaporated onto the PTAA, at \na pressure of 10-6 mbar, while either nickel (Ni) or palladium (Pd) were sputtered (JLS MPS 500 \nsputtering system) through a shadow mask to define an active area of the sensor. After attaching \nfilament wires to the respective electrodes, the devices were encapsulated with plasticized bonding \nwax (Logitech Ltd, UK) by dip coating the diode in the molten wax. The X-ray attenuation \nefficiency of a 1 mm thick paraffin wax layer calculated by using values in a photon attenuation \ndatabase (28) is approximately 5%. We neglect the effect of this wax layer when comparing the \nresponse of the devices to varying X-ray doses. The sensors were stored under nitrogen and in the \ndark to reduce any oxidation effects and to limit dust contamination.        \nThe current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of the ITO\/PTAA\/metal diodes were examined \nusing a voltage source-picoammeter (487, Keithley Instruments, UK) by applying a bias voltage \nfrom -100 to 100 V to the ITO electrode. Dosimetry measurements were performed using 17.5 keV \nK\u03b1 X-rays from a molybdenum target X-ray tube (XF50 11, Oxford instruments, UK). The anode \ncurrent of the tube could be varied up to 1mA at an operational anode voltage of 50 kV, providing \nX-ray dose rates up to 67 mGy\/s. While applying a constant operating voltage to the ITO electrode, \nthe sensor was exposed to the X-ray beam through the metal top electrode. The induced photocurrent \nwas then measured using a voltage source-picoammeter (487, Keithley Instruments, UK). During \nexposure, the sensors were mounted in a steel box, in the dark and at room temperature, 10 cm from \nthe X-ray source.  \n \n  \n7 \n3. Results and discussion  \nThe quality of the rectifying junction formed at the PTAA\/metal interface was examined for \nvarious metal top contacts (Al, Au, Ni or Pd) using a standard current-voltage measurement. Figure \n1a shows the d.c. characteristics for each of the four diodes. Voltage was applied to the ITO \nelectrode in all cases. The results show that the PTAA\/Al interface forms an extremely good \nrectifying junction with a reverse leakage current density as low as 0.4 nA\/cm2 at -100 V and with a \nrectification factor, defined as the ratio between the forward and the reverse leakage currents, of 260. \nOn the other hand, the PTAA\/Au and PTAA\/Ni interfaces form a semi-Ohmic contact with a higher \nleakage current (14 nA\/cm2 at -100 V for the ITO\/PTAA\/Au diode). The rectification factor \ndiminishes to a value of 3 and 6, for the ITO\/PTAA\/Au and ITO\/PTAA\/Ni diodes, respectively. For \nthe ITO\/PTAA\/Pd diode, the I-V curve is symmetric, indicating an Ohmic behavior with an \nextremely high leakage current density of ca. 600 nA\/cm2 at 100 V.  \nThe diode characteristics can be explained through consideration of the metal work functions \nin relation to the HOMO level of the PTAA. Figure 1b represents the corresponding band diagram \nfor each of the ITO\/PTAA\/metal diode structures. The work functions for the metal top contacts, m\u03c6 , \nare taken from reference 29. The HOMO value for PTAA is situated at approximately 5.25 eV \naccording to cyclic voltammetry measurements (30-32), and the band gap energy, Eg, for PTAA was \nfound to be 2.95 eV from previous PL spectroscopy (23). The barrier height for hole injection ( b\u03c6 ) at \nthe PTAA\/metal interface can be evaluated using the following equation (16): \nsmgb E \u03c7\u03c6\u03c6 +\u2212= ,         (1) \nwhere s\u03c7 is the electron affinity of the conjugated polymer. For PTAA, a value of 2.3 eV is used (see \nthe band diagram). From Equation 1, the PTAA\/Al interface is found to have the highest barrier \nheight for hole injection (Table 1) and hence provides a good quality Schottky junction with an \nexceptionally low reverse bias leakage current. For the PTAA\/Au and the PTAA\/Ni interfaces, the \nenergy of the metal work function and the HOMO level of PTAA are relatively close to each other, \nand b\u03c6 is calculated to be 0.15 eV. Therefore, the device displays an Ohmic behavior with a higher \n  \n8 \nleakage current, rather than a Schottky behavior. The ITO\/PTAA\/Pd diode has the highest leakage \ncurrent, due to the negative value of b\u03c6 at the PTAA\/Pd interface (-0.15 eV). This is an indication of \nan Ohmic contact in which the injected carriers (holes) can now flow in either direction without any \nresistance from the interface.   \nTime-dependent X-ray responses, after subtraction of the average dark current, for three \ndifferent metal contacts (Au, Al and Ni) are shown in Figure 2 for an applied voltage of 200 V.  The \nITO\/PTAA\/Pd diodes are unsuitable for X-ray detection because of their high dark current. It is not \npossible to detect the relatively low X-ray photocurrent generated within this device. Therefore, \ndiodes with Pd contacts are not considered further here. The reverse bias in each device was \nachieved by applying a negative voltage at the ITO contact. The X-ray source, generating 17.5 keV \nX-rays from a Mo target, is alternately turned on and off for periods of 180 s for each dose rate. With \na reverse bias, the device produces a negative X-ray photocurrent, however the data are presented \nhere as a positive current. The response of the device with the highest quality of Schottky junction \n(i.e. the ITO\/PTAA\/Al diode) is fast when subjected to the X-ray beam. The X-ray photocurrent \nsignal is stable over the period of exposure. On the other hand, the devices with a semi-Ohmic \ncontact (the ITO\/PTAA\/Au and the ITO\/PTAA\/Ni diodes), display a fast response in the beginning, \nfollowed by a slow building in the X-ray photocurrent, which carries on over the time of exposure. \nFor the ITO\/PTAA\/Au device at an operational voltage of 200V and an X-ray dose rate of 67 mGy\/s, \na characteristic time constant of 71 s is obtained by fitting the slow component with an exponential \nfunction. When the X-rays are switched off, the signal drops sharply in the beginning and then \nshows a slow exponential decay component over time with a characteristic time constant of 79 s \nafter irradiation. A higher time constant of 150 s was found for the ITO\/PTAA\/Ni device.  \nFrom our results, it is obvious that the X-ray response depends greatly on the type of the \nmetal used as a top contact. That is, the quality of the Schottky junction formed at the PTAA\/metal \ninterface plays an essential role in the transient response. Therefore, the metal selection is very \ncrucial for organic sensor fabrication. In general, the work function of the metal contact must be \nsignificantly lower than the HOMO energy level of a particular p-type organic semiconductor to \n  \n9 \nachieve a suitable barrier height. In this particular case, a good Schottky junction is formed at the \nPTAA\/Al interface resulting in a stable photocurrent signal in the device.  \nSeveral authors have reported the observation of a slow transient response in organic \nphotodiodes (33, 34), which is believed to be caused by the presence of electronic traps or defects in \nthe organic semiconductor. The time constant for traps is typically in the range of a few ns for fast \ntraps up to a few minutes for slow traps, depending on the energy level of traps in the material. In \nour study, we see a clear correlation between the transient performance of the measured X-ray \ninduced photocurrent and the effective band gap of the Schottky junction at the metal\/PTAA \ninterface. The observed slow transient response of the ITO\/PTAA\/Au and the ITO\/PTAA\/Ni devices \nis in contrast to the fast response from the ITO\/PTAA\/Al device. Since all properties associated with \nthe bulk material and the PTAA\/ITO interfaces are identical between the diodes, it is clear that the \nnature of the metal\/PTAA interface is responsible for the different transient behaviors. \nSaito and Kobayashi observe similar transient phenomena in modulated photocurrent \nmeasurements of organic photocells (34), and they describe the observed slow time constants in \nterms of a modified space-charge distribution at the Schottky barrier. The optical injection of excess \nphoto-carriers causes the build-up of space-charge limited currents, which influence the effective \nSchottky barrier height due to band bending at the metal-polymer interface. In our data, these effects \nmay be considerably enhanced due to the high density of X-ray generated free carriers throughout \nthe PTAA layer. For the ITO\/PTAA\/Al system, with a larger effective band gap, the influence of X-\nray induced space charge is minimized, and hence this device is more resistant to the formation of \nslow transients, even at high X-ray dose rates. By contrast, the low band-gap devices \u2212 \nITO\/PTAA\/Au and ITO\/PTAA\/Ni \u2212 are much more sensitive to small changes in the metal-PTAA \ninterface due to space-charge build-up. \nA transition in the X-ray response curve from a fast, stable response to a slow response is \nfound when operating at a high voltage. Figure 3 demonstrates a typical dynamic X-ray photocurrent \nresponse, after subtraction of the average dark current, for 30 \u00b5m thick PTAA sensors with Al or Au \nelectrodes, as a function of increasing bias voltage and increasing dose rate. The devices are \n  \n10 \noperated under reverse bias conditions in which the ITO electrode is negatively biased. The dose rate \nof the incident X-rays is varied from 6 to 67 mGy\/s, and the applied voltage is increased from 10 to \n300 V. The X-ray photocurrent from the sensors increases as the dose rate of the incident X-rays \nincreases and as the reverse bias applied to the diode increases.  \nHere, we have demonstrated the response of the sensor for only one X-ray energy (17.5 keV), \nbut the sensors are expected to show a similar trend of responses to X-rays of different energies. In \ngeneral, the X-ray photocurrent from the PTAA-based sensor at a particular dose rate or applied \nvoltage depends on the amount of X-rays being attenuated in the active material, which significantly \nvaries with the X-ray energy and the thickness of the active layer (23). The X-ray attenuation \ncoefficient can be calculated using the linear attenuation coefficient provided in a photon attenuation \ndatabase (28) and used to determine the effect of the X-ray energy. For instance, the attenuation \ncoefficient for a 30 \u00b5m thick PTAA layer upon 17.5 keV X-ray irradiation is 0.575 cm2\/g. The value \nreduces when subjected to a higher X-ray energy. The attenuation coefficient of the same PTAA \nlayer is found to be 0.026 cm2\/g for an X-ray energy of 6 MeV, and therefore a lower X-ray \nphotocurrent is expected at a higher X-ray energy.   \nFigure 3a shows the response of the ITO\/PTAA\/Al sensor as the X-ray tube is alternately \nswitched on and off for 90 s for each dose rate. The response of the device when subjected to the X-\nray beam (inset Fig. 3a) is faster than the sampling rate of the measurement equipment (0.25 s). This \nholds true for all the applied operational voltages. The induced X-ray photocurrent at each X-ray \ndose rate is stable over the time of exposure, although the signal noise increases with applied voltage \nfrom 0.009 nA at 10 V (at a dose rate of 66 mGy\/s) to 0.9 nA at 300 V. \nThe induced X-ray photocurrent for the ITO\/PTAA\/Au sensor is presented in Figure 3b. In \nthis case, the X-ray source was alternately turned on and off for periods of 180 s. This device shows \na stable X-ray photocurrent response at low dose rates (6 mGy\/s) or low applied voltages (below 60 \nV). However, at either high dose rate or high voltage the induced X-ray photocurrent signal can be \ndivided into two components: an initially fast response followed by a slow increase in the current \nafter approximately 0.5 s, which continues over the time of exposure (e.g. see inset of Fig. 3b). \n  \n11 \nUnder these extreme conditions, the sensor is also slow to recover. After turning off the X-ray \nsource, the current initially falls rapidly and then slowly decays to the dark current base line over \ntime. Similar behavior upon X-ray irradiation can also be seen for the ITO\/PTAA\/Ni sensor (not \nshown here) with a similar value of X-ray photocurrent as found with the ITO\/PTAA\/Au sensor. \nCharge transport in the sensors can be described as follows. Excitons are usually created in \nthe polymer layer after an X-ray photoexcitation process. An applied external electric field separates \nthe excitons into free charge carriers (electrons and holes). Electron transport in conjugated polymers \nis extremely sensitive to impurities. Extrinsic effects, such as the presence of traps specifically for \nelectrons, or the instability of radical-anions upon the presence of water, oxygen and hydroxyl \ngroups, are known to be responsible for the low mobility of electrons in conjugated polymers (35-\n37). Moreover, there is no observable electron transport in PTAA according to TOF results \npublished elsewhere (25). Therefore, the X-ray response from our polymer sensors is mainly due to \nhole transport. \n Figure 4 shows the corrected photocurrent as a function of the applied X-ray dose rate for the \nITO\/PTAA\/Al device, which has been determined at several applied voltages using the data from \nFigure 3. The data show a linear relationship between the measured photocurrent and the X-ray dose \nrate, over a wide range of bias voltages from 10 V to 300 V. The minimum operational voltage in \nour devices to yield sufficient sensitivity is approximately 10 V. This result can be compared with \nwhat is found in a Si p-n detector, which can be operated at an even lower bias, but normally is \noperated fully depleted at high voltage. The increase in photocurrent with bias voltage is consistent \nwith the longer carrier drift length through the PTAA layer due to higher electric field strength. The \nlinear response of the device as a function of increasing dose rate confirms that space charge build- \nup, and related charge injection phenomena, do not affect the device response in this dose rate \nregime.  \nTo achieve sufficient sensitivity to radiation, it is essential that the signal from the induced \nphotocurrent is greater than the background signal. In other words, the capability of the detection in \nthe device is limited by the background signal (noise). Figure 4 demonstrates that if the dose rate of \n  \n12 \nthe X-ray falls below 5 mGy\/s, the induced X-ray photocurrent from the PTAA-based sensors will \nbe in a similar range to the dark current (less than 0.1 nA).  This dose rate defines a detection limit \nfor the sensors.    \nThe performance of the devices has been determined in terms of the sensitivity to ionizing X-\nray radiation (Table 2). The device sensitivity to X-rays was assessed by dividing the slope of the X-\nray photocurrent versus dose rate graph (Fig. 4) by the active volume of the device. Figure 5a shows \nthe increase in the detector sensitivity as the applied reverse bias increases. At low operational \nvoltages (below 100 V), there is no difference in the device sensitivity using either Al or Au as the \ntop electrode. At high applied voltages (above 100 V), however, the ITO\/PTAA\/Au device \nsensitivity is higher. The maximum sensitivity calculated for the ITO\/PTAA\/Al and the \nITO\/PTAA\/Au sensors was 130 and 200 nC\/mGy\/cm3, respectively. The sensitivity for both devices \napproaches a saturation value at high operational voltages. Similar results have been seen for a 20 \n\u00b5m thick PTAA sensor (not shown here). In calculating the sensitivity values presented in Figure 5a, \nthe X-ray photocurrent obtained at the end of the exposure time was used.  Both the fast and the slow \ncomponents of the response of the ITO\/PTAA\/Au devices are considered. \n For comparison, Figure 5b demonstrates the sensitivity of the devices to X-ray radiation \nwhen only the fast rising component of the X-ray photocurrent is considered: the slow component in \nthe ITO\/PTAA\/Au sensor is ignored. In this case, the calculated sensitivity from both devices is very \nsimilar for each applied voltage and both asymptote towards a saturation value at a high reverse bias. \nThe result indicates that the fast component of the response from both devices has the same origin, \nwhich derives from the carrier generation within PTAA molecules. The results clearly show that \nusing an Au electrode provides an extra induced X-ray photocurrent in the sensor at high applied \nfield, which may be used to produce a higher sensitivity to X-ray irradiation. However, the long \ncurrent stabilization and device recovery times, arising from the slow component of the X-ray \nphotocurrent signal, means that the device is less applicable for fast X-ray detection applications. \nThe performance of the PTAA sensors over a long period of exposure for five consecutive \nmeasurements is presented in Figure 6. Here, the most extreme case of exposure, an X-ray dose rate \n  \n13 \nof 67 mGy\/s and an operational voltage of 300 V, has been chosen to test the stability and \nrepeatability of the signal from the devices. The sensors were exposed to the X-rays for 20 minutes, \nfor a total dose of 80 Gy in each measurement. The response of the ITO\/PTAA\/Al device (Fig. 6a) is \nagain faster than the sampling rate of the measurement electronics (0.25 s). The induced X-ray \nphotocurrent (7 nA) has a good stability over the time of measurement. The X-ray response for the \nITO\/PTAA\/Au sensor (Fig. 6b) is initially fast (<0.25 s) and then exhibits the slow exponential rise \nof the induced current to a saturation value of 15 nA with an average, characteristic time constant, \u03c4 \n= 77 s obtained by fitting to an exponential function. When the X-rays are turned off, the induced \ncurrent initially falls quickly to a certain value and then has a slow exponential decay with an \naverage, characteristic time constant of \u03c4 = 130 s to the dark current base line value. With the \noperational bias still applied, this slow decay of the charge is probably due to the de-trapping of \ncharge carriers. The results prove that our devices can be repeatedly operated under extreme \nconditions of radiation with no noticeable degradation of the polymer active layer for up to 100 \nminutes at 67 mGy\/s.        \nFinally, the performance of the sensors has been evaluated in terms of the signal-to-noise \nratio (Fig. 7). The signal-to-noise ratio, defined as the corrected X-ray photocurrent divided by the \ndark current, was calculated using the data from Figure 3 at an X-ray dose rate of 67 mGy\/s. Figure \n7a shows that the signal-to-noise ratio for the ITO\/PTAA\/Al sensor is higher than that for the \nITO\/PTAA\/Au sensor, with 30 \u00b5m thick PTAA layers in each case. This result indicates that the \nITO\/PTAA\/Au device suffers from a higher dark current, which has been presented previously in \ncurrent\/voltage measurements. The semi-Ohmic Au\/PTAA contact produces a high dark current \nwhen operated at a high reverse bias (ca. 10 nA at 300 V).  \nThe Al\/PTAA interface in the ITO\/PTAA\/Al sensor, on the other hand, produces a rectifying \njunction. The dark current, in this case, is extremely low, when operated in reverse bias (see Figure \n1A), which leads to a high signal-to-noise ratio. Figure 7b shows a similar result for the signal-to-\nnoise ratio for sensors with a 20 \u00b5m thick PTAA layer. In detector applications, a low leakage \ncurrent at high applied field is desirable in order to maximize the induced X-ray photocurrent. The \n  \n14 \nuse of the Al contact satisfies this requirement and produces a stable photocurrent even at high \napplied bias. It is noted that changing the contact area should not alter the signal-to-noise ratio \nbecause the dark current should scale with the contact area in the same way that the photocurrent \nwill. But changing the bias voltage, the film properties, or the X-ray intensity will significantly alter \nthe quality of the signal \n \n4. Conclusions \nWe have reported the successful fabrication of prototype organic sensors with 30 \u00b5m thick \nPTAA films as an active material for real-time direct X-ray detection. It has been shown that the \nPTAA devices can detect 17.5 keV X-ray radiation with dose rates as low as 6 mGy\/s, and with \nsensitivities up to 200 nC\/mGy\/cm3 for dose rates ranging up to 67 mGy\/s.  \nIt was discovered that the choice of electrode contact material has a large effect on device \nperformance. A high rectification Schottky diode can be achieved using a metal with a work function \nlower than the HOMO level of the polymer. The resulting higher barrier height metal-polymer \ncontact produces a fast time-independent response with very stable photocurrent output and a high \nsignal-to-noise ratio. When using PTAA, it was found that Al is very suitable for the metal contact.  \nThe Al diode devices show no discernable reduction in stability when exposed to a total of 400 Gy \nof X-rays over time periods up to 100 minutes. In contrast, diodes with lower barrier heights, \nfabricated with either Au or Ni contacts, show a long-lived, slow transient response to X-ray \nirradiation, due to X-ray-induced charge injection and the build-up of space charge close to the \nmetal-polymer interface.  \nWe conclude that when selecting the material for the contacts on a polymeric sensor, the \nmetal\u2019s work function should lie between the HOMO and LUMO levels of the chosen polymer. \nGood induced current stability, high signal-to-noise ratio and measurement reproducibility \ndemonstrate that PTAA can be used in real-time direct X-ray detection applications, provided that an \nAl (or similar) metal is used as the contact. These results are more widely applicable to polymer \ndiodes operating in a high charge-injection regime, such as in photovoltaic devices or light sensors. \n  \n15 \nAcknowledgements \nAI acknowledges a scholarship from the Office of the Higher Education Commission of the \nRoyal Thai Government.
