Introduction\n[2] There is considerable interest in retrieving information\non past climatic history using records of glacier fluctuations\nand in determining future changes in size and distribution\nof glaciers caused by possible future global climate change\n[e.g., Haeberli and Beniston, 1998; Oerlemans, 2001]. For\nthe transient evolution of large ice masses to be calculated,\nboth the mass balance variation in space and time and the\nmechanics of glacier flow must be accounted for. The\nquestion arises as to what level of detail the mechanics of\nice flow must be described for the purpose of calculating\nclimate-related length changes over timescales longer than\na few years.\n[3] Here we address this question by comparing two\nnumerical models of the retreat and advance of typically\nsized alpine glaciers: a two-dimensional model including all\nterms of the momentum equations (full-system model) and a\nshallow ice approximation (SIA) model [Hutter, 1983].\nThis type of comparison has not been performed before.\nThe full-system model includes gradients of all stress\ncomponents in both spatial directions, while the SIA model\nignores all horizontal stress gradients, leading to a greatly\nsimplified description of glacier flow, where the flux at every\npoint is related to the local surface slope and ice thickness.\nFurthermore, the full-system model uses a moving-mesh\ntechnique, allowing the position of the snout to be deter-\nmined with high accuracy. The SIA model, on the other\nhand, uses a spatially fixed grid, a commonly used mesh\nmethod in glacier mechanics.\n[4] The SIA has been used in most previous studies of\nthe effects of mass balance changes on glaciers and ice\nsheets [e.g., Oerlemans, 2001], with the noticeable excep-\ntion of the work of Albrecht et al. [2000] and Vieli et al.\n[2001]. The SIA forms the foundation of most current\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 109, F01007, doi:10.1029\/2003JF000027, 2004\n1Now at Bristol Glaciology Centre, School of Geographical Sciences,\nUniversity of Bristol, Bristol, UK.\n2Now at British Antarctic Survey, Natural Environment Research\nCouncil, Cambridge, UK.\nCopyright 2004 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/04\/2003JF000027$09.00\nF01007 1 of 14\nmechanical models of ice sheets and ice caps [e.g.,\nHuybrechts, 1992; Hulbe and Payne, 2001].\n[5] Raymond et al. [1989] calculated changes in glacier\nlength induced by climate change using several ice flow\nmodels of increasing complexity. They concluded that the\ninitial reaction of glaciers to changing climate is a complex\nprocess requiring fairly sophisticated ice flow models.\nThey suggested that the asymptotic approach to steady\nstate can, on the other hand, be described using much\nsimpler models.\n[6] Greuell [1992] found that including longitudinal\ndeviatoric stress gradients hardly affected the calculated\nresponse of Hintereisferner over timescales longer than\n\u0001100 years. Using SIA models for the calculation of\nshorter-term fluctuations was found to be problematic.\n[7] Pattyn [2002] calculated the response of Haut Glacier\nd\u2019Arolla to perturbations in thickness and mass balance\nusing a full-system model and compared results with those\nof a SIA model. As he used an altitude-independent mass\nbalance perturbation, the steady state geometry was the\nsame for both models. The rate at which the glacier\napproached steady state differed, however; these differences\nwere judged to be rather small for the particular mass\nbalance forcing used, \u000110%.\n2. Model Description\n[8] The gravity-driven transient evolution of an ice mass\nis calculated with a two-dimensional vertical plane flow\nmodel. The equations are written for a two-dimensional\nCartesian geometry in an Eulerian reference frame with\nindices i, j = 1, 2, where the index 1 stands for the horizontal\nand 2 for the vertical component. The field equations to be\nsolved describe the conservation of mass for incompressible\nmaterials,\nvi;i \u00bc 0;\nand the conservation of angular and linear momentum,\nsij \u00bc sji and rgi \u00fe sij;j \u00bc 0; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere vi are the components of the velocity vector, sij are\nthe components of the Cauchy stress tensor, r is the material\ndensity, and gi are the components of the gravity vector. The\ncomma notation is employed, in which the indices\nfollowing a comma imply a partial differentiation with\nrespect to the corresponding spatial variable.\n[9] A nonlinear power law [Glen, 1955; Steinemann,\n1958] is used to describe the relationship between deviatoric\nstresses and strain rates:\n_\u0002ij \u00bc A tn\u00061 s\u00f0d\u00deij ; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere _\u0002ij are the strain rates and sij\n(d) are the deviatoric\nstresses given by sij\n(d ) = sij \u0006 (1\/3)dijskk. The effective\nshear stress t is defined by t2 = (1\/2)sij\n(d)sij\n(d). In all\nmodel calculations the rate factor is assumed constant for\nthe whole ice mass, and the flow law exponent n is taken to\nbe 3.\n[10] The free surface evolves according to the kinematic\nboundary condition\n@zs\n@t\n\u00fe us @zs\n@x\n\u0006 ws \u00bc _b z\u00f0 \u00de; \u00f03\u00de\nwhere zs (x, t) describes the surface elevation, t is the time,\nus and ws are the horizontal and vertical components of the\nflow velocity at the surface, respectively, and _b(z) is the\nmass balance rate function. The mass balance rate function\ncan be either a function of the glacier bed z = zb(x) or, more\nrealistically, of the surface altitude z = zs (x, t) and therefore\ntime-dependent. The velocities at the lower boundary are set\nto zero.\n[11] Two different numerical models are used: (1) a full-\nsystem model, which solves all the terms of the above\nfield equations, and (2) a shallow ice approximation (SIA)\nmodel [Hutter, 1983], which ignores all stress gradients\nother than the vertical gradient of shear stress. The SIA is\nthat d = d\/l \u0007 1, where d is a typical ice thickness and l is a\nhorizontal distance scale. It is common to refer to models\nsolving the zeroth-order shallow ice equations simply as\nshallow ice approximation models.\n[12] The implementation of the SIA model used here is\nbased on finite differences on a fixed grid. The flux and\nslope are calculated by using centered differences at a\nstaggered grid with a semi-implicit forward step in time.\nThis is a standard approach often used in modeling of ice\nmasses [Hindmarsh and Payne, 1996]. The terminus\nposition is calculated as the first grid point where the\nice thickness is zero and no subgrid tracking of terminus\nposition is attempted. Discretization errors in terminus\nposition were estimated by using different grid sizes and\nwere found to be comparable to, or less than, the grid\nsize.\n[13] The full-system calculations were performed with the\ncommercial finite element (FE) program MARC, adapted\nfor use in glaciology by Gudmundsson [1999]. A four-node,\nisoparametric, quadrilateral Hermann element is used with a\nbilinear velocity interpolation. The code solves the full set\nof momentum equations and has been used extensively for\nflow modeling of alpine and of grounded tidewater glaciers\n[Gudmundsson, 1999; Vieli et al., 2001]. The results of the\nnumerical FE code have been verified in various ways, for\nexample, by comparing calculated results with analytical\nsolutions [Gudmundsson, 1997; A\u00f0algeirsdo\u00b4ttir et al., 2000;\nRaymond et al., 2003].\n[14] The full-system model uses a moving grid, with the\nsurface grid points moving every time step in both hori-\nzontal and vertical directions as needed in order to represent\nthe new surface position as accurately as possible. The\ninterior nodal points are then redistributed within the\ndeforming body so as to minimize element distortion. This\nis done without affecting the connectivity of the finite\nelement mesh or the number of nodal degrees of freedom.\nThe structure of the system of equations does, hence, not\nchange during the calculation. Since a direct solver is used,\nconserving the structure of the equations improves the\nnumerical efficiency of the approach as no reassembling\nof the equation system is needed during a model run. It\nhas been verified that the remeshing algorithm preserves\nvolume accurately [Leysinger and Gudmundsson, 2000].\nF01007 LEYSINGER VIELI AND GUDMUNDSSON: ESTIMATING GLACIER FLUCTUATIONS\n2 of 14\nF01007\n[15] The full-system model typically requires hours or\ndays on a multipurpose parallel computer (HP-Superdome).\nWith a SIA model, the same problem can be solved within\nminutes on a typical personal computer. Evidently, it is of\nconsiderable practical interest to be able to use the SIA\nwhenever possible. It is, however, a nontrivial task to\nestimate the errors introduced by ignoring the horizontal\nstress terms. This can be done through a model intercompar-\nison study. We find that although the velocities at the snout\nare strongly model-dependent, the differences in calculated\nrates of advance and retreat are small. This finding supports\nthe macroscale approach to glacier mechanics advocated by\nOerlemans [1989], Jo\u00b4hannesson et al. [1989b], Van der Veen\n[1999], and Harrison et al. [2001].\n3. Model Intercomparison Study\n[16] The purpose of the model-model comparisons is to\nquantify the modeling errors introduced in calculating the\nretreat and advance of ice masses using a no-slip basal\nboundary condition when reduced numerical models such\nas the SIA models are used instead of the more complete\nfull-system model. The SIA is an example of a long-\nwavelength approximation theory that assumes the aspect\nratio (d) to be small. How small d must be for the errors to\nremain within certain bounds is a question to which it is\ndifficult to give a general answer. If basal motion is small\ncompared with the deformational velocity, the SIA is\naccurate to O(d2). The accuracy of the SIA is, however,\nexpected to depend on other parameters besides d, such as\nthe relative contributions of internal ice deformation and of\nbasal motion to the mean forward velocity [Gudmundsson,\n2003].\n[17] In some instances the aspect ratio becomes irrelevant\nfor the accuracy of calculated quantities. For glaciers in\nsteady state, for example, the horizontal flux at every\nlocation is given by the integral of the mass balance rate\nfunction over the catchment area upstream of that location.\nFor a given mass balance distribution, any flow model\nwhich does not create or destroy mass will then produce\naccurate flux values and identical steady state lengths,\nirrespective of aspect ratios or rheological assumptions. If,\nhowever, the mass balance distribution depends on altitude,\nwhich is reasonable to expect, any model-dependent differ-\nences in calculated ice thicknesses will give rise to\ncorresponding model-dependent differences in mass balance\nthat will then further affect the ice thickness distribution.\nThis mass balance altitude feedback effect can thus be\nexpected to amplify any initial model-dependent differences\nin calculated glacier lengths and ice thicknesses. This\nillustrates the importance of doing model runs both with\nand without a mass balance altitude feedback. Furthermore,\nif a mass balance altitude feedback is included, the depen-\ndence of mass balance on altitude must be realistic.\n[18] Calculations without a mass balance feedback are\nonly of interest when done for glaciers not in steady state. If\na glacier is far from steady state, the accuracy of the SIA\ncan, for a given slip ratio (ratio of basal motion to defor-\nmational velocity), be expected to depend primarily on the\naspect ratio. (How far a glacier is from steady state can be\nquantified through a comparison of the terms of the conti-\nnuity equation relating specific mass balance rate _b, flux\ngradients @xq, and rate of surface altitude change @tz. If\n@tz \u0007 _b everywhere, the specific mass balance is closely\nbalanced by flux gradients and the glacier can be considered\nto be close to a steady state.) Here we estimate model errors,\nnot related to mass balance altitude feedback, by following\nthe transient evolution of different blocks of ice character-\nized through an initial span-to-thickness ratio (modeling\nsuite 1). To ensure that the ice blocks are never in steady\nstate, the mass balance distribution is set to zero every-\nwhere. Our primary interest is in quantifying differences in\nthe rate of advance as a function of time. As the block of ice\nspreads out on a horizontal plane, its thickness decreases,\nand the aspect ratio becomes smaller. On the basis of this,\none expects the rates of advance as calculated by a SIA and\na full-system model to become progressively more similar\nwith time. However, at any given time the SIA does not\nhold at the snout. Should the rate of advance be determined\nby local conditions at the snout only, model-dependent\ndifferences can therefore be expected to persist forever.\nAs explained in detail in section 3.1, our findings are that\napart from a relatively short initial period of time (on the\norder of a few tens of years (d = 1) to a few years (d = 0.2,\n0.1)), both SIA and the full-system models do give rise to\nprogressively similar rates of advance.\n[19] The other situation considered here pertains to gla-\nciers that are close to steady state and that have an altitude-\ndependent mass balance distribution (modeling suite 2). For\nan altitude-dependent mass balance distribution an identical\nthickness distribution is a sufficient condition for a SIA and\na full-system model to produce identical steady state flux\nvalues. It is clear that the errors in ice thicknesses as\ncalculated by the SIA may, in turn, be considered to be\ncaused by aspect ratios that are too large. However, the\naspect ratio alone does not control the size of the modeling\nerrors. For a given aspect ratio, one can expect the differ-\nences in glacier lengths calculated by SIA and full-system\nmodels to increase with the strength of the mass balance\naltitude feedback. Furthermore, calculated thicknesses are\nalso linearly related to the value of the rate factor (A). As its\nvalue is not accurately known, A effectively becomes a\ntunable model parameter that can be used to improve\nagreement between observed and calculated thickness dis-\ntributions. Here we do not try to give a complete assessment\nof SIA modeling errors as a function of aspect ratio and the\nstrength of the mass balance feedback effect, nor do we\nattempt to give a full answer to what extent model-depen-\ndent differences can be masked by varying the value of the\nrate factor. Rather, our approach here is to focus on\nsituations that can be considered typical for alpine glaciers\nand to conduct case studies of small, medium, and large\nalpine glaciers using realistic mass balance distributions.\n3.1. Modeling Suite 1: Geometry Evolution\nExperiments\n[20] The lateral spread of the rectangular blocks bears a\nstrong similarity to the self-similar solution of Halfar\n[1981]. As the Halfar problem is stable with respect to\nperturbations in surface shape that preserve volume, the\nprofiles will settle down to the Halfar solution with time. A\nself-similar problem does, by its very nature, not have\ndefinable length scales. The height and the width evolve\nas (h(x, t)\/hc(t))\n(1+1\/n) + (l(x, t)\/s(t))(2+1\/n) = 1, where hc(t) is\nF01007 LEYSINGER VIELI AND GUDMUNDSSON: ESTIMATING GLACIER FLUCTUATIONS\n3 of 14\nF01007\nthe center height and s(t) is the span. For a given center\nheight a timescale can be defined for the Halfar solution as\nthe time since the ice cap may have evolved from an initial\ndelta function of a given strength [Nye, 2000]. This time-\nscale is clearly not of interest here. As the problem does not\nhave definable length and timescales, rather than using\ndimensional variables, we normalize the results using the\ninitial height and typical glacier surface velocities. Both\nspatial dimensions are normalized with the initial thickness\nof the block. The time is, somewhat arbitrarily, normalized\nwith the ratio of thickness to the analytical solution of the\ndeformational velocity for an infinite slab (analytical solu-\ntion identical to shallow ice approximation) on a slope\nhaving an angle of 3\u0005. For typical values of the rate factor\nA for temperate ice, one dimensionless time unit (T )\ncorresponds to several decades. For rock glaciers, which\nare thinner and have much smaller surface velocities than\ntypical alpine glaciers, the corresponding conversion factor\nis on the order of 1000 years.\n[21] The transient evolution of rectangular blocks with\ninitial heights h0 and widths l0 for three different initial\naspect ratios d = h0\/l0 = 1, 0.2, and 0.1 (Figure 1a) were\ncalculated. Depending on the aspect ratios, the number of\nelements vary so that for d = 1, 20 \b 20 elements are used,\nfor d = 0.2, 10 \b 50 elements are used, and for d = 0.1, 10 \b\n100 elements are used. Owing to the symmetry of the\nproblem, only one half of the block was modeled.\n3.1.1. Surface Evolution\n[22] Figure 1 shows surface geometries at four different\ntimes as calculated with both the full-system model and the\nSIA model. For clarity, additional time steps are shown in\nFigure 2 for the block with the initial aspect ratio of d = 1.\n[23] In Figure 2a, it can be seen how the full-system\nsolution predicts the central part to initially sink down faster\nthan the edges. With time, the amplitude of the surface\ndepression becomes smaller, while the elevation minimum\nmoves progressively toward what, at the start of the calcu-\nlation, was the upper right-hand corner point. The surface\ndepression eventually coalesces with the corner point and\ndisappears. As is expected for a steep glacier margin, the\nhorizontal velocity increases with depth over some distance,\ncreating a zone of extrusion flow.\n[24] A noticeable property of the full-system solution not\nshared by the SIA solution is that the corner point remains a\nvisible feature for some time. The corner point can, for\nFigure 1.

At the corner\npoint the boundary conditions require all stresses to be zero\nat the start of the calculation. For subsequent time steps the\nstresses acting on the corner are still low, and therefore the\napproximate shape of the corner point is preserved for some\ntime (Figure 1). The SIA is known to lead to too short decay\ntimes at wavelengths comparable with and smaller than the\nmean ice thickness [Gudmundsson, 2003], and for that\nreason, the corner point disappears faster in the SIA model\nthan it does in the full-system model.\n[25] Figures 2a and 2b show the transient evolution of the\nd = 1 rectangle as calculated by the full-system and the SIA\nmodels, respectively. Note that the spatial scales are the\nsame in both figures. A comparison of Figures 2a and 2b\nillustrates some of the key model-dependent differences.\nThe surface shapes and velocities are qualitatively different,\nwith the full-system surface being concave, whereas the SIA\ngives a convex surface shape. In the SIA, flow velocities are\nalways directed in the direction of the steepest slopes.\nSurface troughs and hollows can therefore only exist for a\nlimited amount of time as they must eventually get filled up\nwith ice. For this reason, one generally expects surfaces\ncalculated using the SIA to be convex. The SIA cannot\nproduce an increase in forward velocities with depth and\ntherefore no extrusion flow is seen in Figure 2b.\n3.1.2. Rate of Advance\n[26] At the start of the calculation the slope at the upper-\nright corner point is discontinuous. The velocities calculated\nwith the SIA at that point depend, however, on the local ice\nthickness and surface slope. In the particular numerical\nimplementation of the SIA used here (which is a standard\nfinite difference approach often used in modeling of ice\nmasses) the flux and slope are calculated by using centered\ndifferences at a staggered grid with a semi-implicit forward\nstep in time. For a given spatial discretization, with flux and\nslope calculated at a staggered grid, a finite value is\nobtained for the surface slope at the corner point, and\nconsequently, a finite velocity is obtained at that point as\nwell. However, this velocity depends on the particular grid\nspacing used, approaching infinity as the grid spacing\nshrinks to zero. At the first time step of the SIA model,\nthis corner is the only point of the surface with a nonzero\nvelocity. During subsequent steps the velocities become\nnonzero to the left and the right of the corner point at a\nrate that is dependent on the size of the time step and the\nexact discretization scheme used. Clearly, the velocities\naround the corner point are not only wrong by an arbitrary\namount at the start of the calculation but also do not fulfill\ngrid size independence, which is a basic requirement for a\ncorrect numerical solution. One might therefore expect that\nnot only the velocities at the snout, as calculated using the\nSIA, but also the rate of advance of the snout will be\nincorrect.\n[27] By comparing the position of the snout obtained by\nboth models in Figure 1 and by comparing the slopes of the\ncurves in Figure 3, it becomes clear that this is, however,\nnot the case. Figure 1 shows that early in the calculation, the\nfront positions calculated with the SIA model are farther to\nthe right than those of the full-system model. As time\nproceeds, these differences, however, become progressively\nsmaller. In Figure 1d, these differences are 9% (3.5 times\nthe SIA grid sizes) for d = 1, 3.5% (2.1 times SIA grid sizes)\nfor d = 0.2, and 2.5% (2.3 times the SIA grid sizes) for d =\n0.1.\n[28] As the rectangles spread out, their aspect ratios go\nasymptotically to zero and with them the errors of the SIA\nmodel. Both models converge toward the same geometry,\nwhich can be seen as a consequence of the stability of the\nHalfar solution with respect to perturbations in the surface\nprofile that conserve volume [e.g.,Halfar, 1981;Hindmarsh,\n1990; Nye, 2000]. Comparing Halfar\u2019s analytical solution\nfor the surface profile with the SIA surface profile shows\nthat the differences drop almost immediately below 1%\n(e.g., at T = 0.004 for d = 1) over most of the model domain.\nDifferences of more than a few tenths percent are only\nobserved at the very margin, and the differences become\nsmaller with time. For the full-system model, deviations in\nsurface profile from the Halfar solution are, at every time\nstep, larger than those of the SIA model. This is to be\nexpected as the Halfar solution is derived by assuming the\nflux to be a local function of thickness and slope. For T\nlarger than \u00013.2 and d = 1 the difference in the central\nsurface height (x = 0) between the two models is <2%. For\nd = 0.2 and d = 0.1 thedifference becomes <2% for T > 1.4\nand 0.4, respectively (Figure 1).\n[29] Figure 3 shows the position of the snout as a function\nof time. The slopes of the curves give rates of advance.\nThere is some initial offset between curves calculated with\nthe SIA model and the full-system model. This offset is\ncaused by differences in calculated rates of advance at the\nvery beginning of each model run. Although not easy to see\nin Figure 3, the curves converge with time.\n[30] The horizontal velocity component along the surface\nat different times is shown in Figure 4 for the three different\nvalues of d and for both the full-system and the SIA models.\nNear the front, surface velocities calculated with the two\nnumerical models are significantly different at all times.\nThis is to be expected. At the snout, surface slopes tend to\ninfinity and with it the velocities as calculated using the\nSIA. Again, the reason why the SIA model does not\nproduce infinite velocity is because of the finite distance\nbetween the nodes of the numerical grid. Hence, although\nthe overall surface shapes and the rate of advance of the\nfront position are insensitive to the different sets of assump-\ntions on which the two numerical models are based, the\nsurface velocities at the front remain different. For the block\nwith d = 1, Figure 4 shows that the two velocity profiles\nFigure 3.

Modeling Suite 2: Advance and Retreat of No-Slip\nAlpine-Type Glaciers\n[31] The numerical experiments with rectangular blocks\ndiscussed in section 3.1 showed that for all initial aspect\nratios the surface geometry, the front position, and the\nadvance velocity became progressively more similar as\nboth models were integrated forward in time. The question\nnow arises as to whether including mass balance altitude\nfeedback and using more realistic glacier geometries\nchanges the situation significantly.\n[32] As a first step, model runs are performed using a\nx-dependent mass balance distribution. Thus, there is no\naltitude mass balance feedback and the modeled steady\nstate front positions must be equal for both models. This\nposition can be determined analytically, allowing the\naccuracy of the numerical models to be estimated.\n[33] In a second, and more interesting, step the evolution\nof three differently sized alpine glaciers are calculated with\na realistic mass balance altitude function. The mass balance\nrate function is of the form\n_b z\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc\naacc zs \u0006 ELA\u00f0 \u00de when zs > ELA\naabl zs \u0006 ELA\u00f0 \u00de when zs \t ELA\n;\n8<\n: \u00f04\u00de\nwhere ELA is the equilibrium line altitude and aabl and aacc\nare the mass balance gradients below and above the\nequilibrium line, respectively. The values for the mass\nbalance gradients are set to aacc = 2.8 \b 10\u00063 a\u00061 and aabl =\n6.7 \b 10\u00063 a\u00061. These particular values are derived from\nmass balance data from Griesgletscher for the observation\nperiod of 1994\u20131995 [Herren and Hoelzle, 1991] but are\nalso rather typical of other alpine glaciers and other time\nperiods [e.g., Oerlemans, 2001, pp. 41\u201344]. The ELA is\narbitrarily set at 2801 m above sea level (asl). The\nequilibrium line altitude is then perturbed, and the transient\nevolution of the glaciers is followed in detail until a new\nsteady state is established. The transient response to\nspatially confined mass balance perturbations acting over\na limited period of time is also investigated.\n3.2.1. Model Setting\n[34] The three prototype glaciers correspond in terms\nof lengths l, mean slopes, and absolute heights to a small\n(1 km \t l < 5 km), a medium-sized (5 km \t l < 10 km), and\na large (l \n 10 km) valley glacier, respectively, following\nthe glacier length classification of Herren et al. [1999] for\nSwiss glaciers (Figure 5). Grosser Aletschgletscher has\nbeen chosen to represent a large glacier with a maximum\naltitude of 4140 m asl, a length of 24.7 km, and a mean\nslope of 6.1\u0005. Griesgletscher has been chosen to represent a\nmedium-sized glacier with a maximum altitude of 3360 m\nasl, a length of 6.2 km, and a mean slope of 9.0\u0005. Finally,\nGhiacciaio del Basodino is used to represent a small glacier\nwith a maximum altitude of 3220 m asl, a length of 1.6 km,\nand a mean slope of 26.0\u0005 [Mu\u00a8ller et al., 1976].\n[35] The three chosen glaciers are located in three differ-\nent valleys in the central Swiss Alps. Despite some expected\ndifferences in local climate, the different glacier lengths are\npresumably mainly related to variations in bed slope\n[Schmeits and Oerlemans, 1997; Oerlemans, 2001]. Thus\nwe assume that all three model glaciers are exposed to the\nsame climatic conditions, and we use the same mass balance\nrate function for all three glaciers. The bed topography is\nparameterized using two differently inclined planes. The\nsteep upper plane (45\u0005) is of short horizontal distance (1\/20\nof the maximum length) and corresponds to a headwall\nwhich frames the upper bound of the glaciers. The lower\nplane is inclined by 4.5\u0005 for the large glacier, by 5.5\u0005 for the\nmedium-sized glacier, and by 23.5\u0005 for the small glacier\n(Figure 5). This leads to an average slope for each glacier\ncorresponding closely to that of the prototype.\n[36] For each glacier the model calculation starts from a\nsteady state situation calculated using an initial ELA of\n2801 m asl (hereinafter referred to as initial steady state).\nFigure 4. Surface velocities (thick lines) and surface\nprofile (thin lines, note different spatial scales) as a function\nof distance at different times, calculated with a full-system\nmodel (solid lines) and the SIA model (dash-dotted lines)\nfor three different initial aspect ratios. The center of each\nmodel is at x = 0, but for clarity, not all profiles are shown in\ntheir entirety.\nF01007 LEYSINGER VIELI AND GUDMUNDSSON: ESTIMATING GLACIER FLUCTUATIONS\n6 of 14\nF01007\nAdvance and retreat are caused by shifting the ELA by\n\u00b1100 m. In all experiments with the full-system model the\nnumber of elements is kept constant (10 \b 160). The sizes\nof the elements vary logarithmically, with the smallest\nelements close to the margins.\n3.2.2. Reaction Ignoring Mass Balance\nAltitude Feedback\n[37] In the absence of a mass balance altitude feedback\nthe relationship between the change in length \u0002l and a\ngiven perturbation in the mass balance rate \u0002_b is indepen-\ndent of rheology and dynamics of flow. For example, for a\nlinear variation in mass balance rate _b (x) with horizontal\ndistance x the relation is \u0002_blo + _b(lo) \u0002l = 0, where \u0002_b is\nthe uniform shift in mass balance rate, lo is the original\nposition of the terminus, and _b(lo) is the nonperturbed mass\nbalance rate at the original terminus position [Nye, 1960].\nThere is no such relationship between the perturbation in\nmass balance rate and the resulting perturbation in volume.\nThe volume perturbation can only be calculated by making\nsome assumptions about glacier flow, rheology, and bedrock\ngeometry.\n[38] For both models, calculated front positions agreed\nwith the analytical solution (3287 m). Errors for the SIA\nmodel were within the grid resolution of 10 m. As an\nexample, for the medium-sized glacier, differences between\ncalculated and correct length were 7 and 0.1 m for the SIA\nand the full-system models, respectively.\n[39] Figure 6 shows the length and volume changes for\nthe medium-sized glacier for both an advance and a retreat.\nThe initial steady state volume of the full-system model\nwas \u00014.1% larger than the volume of the SIA model.\nThe cumulative volume change was, however, essentially\nidentical. There is a slight asymmetry in length and volume\nchange with respect to retreat and advance (Figure 6) which\nis related to the mass balance rate distribution not being a\nstrictly linear function of distance. Here the mass balance\ndistribution is described with two linear functions linked at\nELA (equation (4)). If the mass balance rate distribution\nwere a linear function of distance, the perturbation in length\nwould be twice the horizontal shift in ELA and symmetric\nwith respect to retreat and advance.\n3.2.3. Reaction Including Altitude Mass Balance\nFeedback\n[40] Now an altitude-dependent mass balance function is\nused for both numerical models. First, the initial steady\nstates for an ELA at 2801 m asl were calculated using both\nmodels for all three glaciers. Starting from these initial\nsteady states, the advances and retreats to new steady states\nwere then determined.\n3.2.3.1. Initial Steady State\n[41] The initial steady state geometries calculated by the\nfull-system model are generally thicker than those calculated\nwith the SIA model (Table 1). The difference between the\ninitial full-system and the initial SIA steady state surface at\nthe SIA grid points is shown in Figure 7. The largest differ-\nences in surface shapes between the two models are found\nwhere the errors of the SIA can be expected to be largest,\nwhich is along the upper steeper slope and at the front. These\ndifferences in the surface are largest for the small glacier and\nsmallest for the large glacier. As a fraction of their\ncorresponding thicknesses, these model-dependent differen-\nces can be considered to be insignificant for both the\nmedium-sized and the large-sized glaciers (3.8% and 1.6%,\nrespectively) but significant for the small glacier (17.0%).\nThese model-dependent differences in initial steady state\nFigure 5.

The ELA was set at 2801 m\nabove sea level: (a) the small, (b) the medium-sized, and\n(c) the large glacier are shown using identical scalings.\nFigure 6. (a) Cumulative length and (b) volume changes\nof the medium-sized glacier as functions of time and as\ncalculated using a full-system (solid lines) and a SIA (dash-\ndotted lines) model with no mass balance altitude feedback.\nF01007 LEYSINGER VIELI AND GUDMUNDSSON: ESTIMATING GLACIER FLUCTUATIONS\n7 of 14\nF01007\nvolume and length are caused by an overall increase in ice\nthickness in the full-system model needed to overcome\nhorizontal stresses. In the SIA model the flux depends only\non the local surface slope and the local thickness, whereas in\nthe full-system model the overall glacier geometry can, to\nsome extent, affect the local flux through transmission of\nhorizontal stresses. In the vicinity of the snout, horizontal\nstresses act to hinder the motion. As a consequence, ice\nthicknesses become larger as compared with those of the SIA\nmodel. Because of the mass balance altitude feedback, the\nincreased overall thickness leads to an increased total glacier\nlength. Small additional differences are due to the different\nmeshing techniques of the two models. The full-system\nmodel uses an adaptive grid that moves with the surface.\nThe front position is therefore not bound to a set of spatially\nfixed nodal points, as in the SIA model. The errors in\nterminus positions of the SIA model are comparable to the\ngrid spacing. Those grid size effects on calculated front\npositions could be estimated rather easily by using a number\nof meshes having different grid sizes. Grid spacing was thus\nkept small enough for the purpose of the model intercom-\nparison. No subgrid tracking of the terminus [e.g., Lam and\nDowdeswell, 1996] was attempted, but doing so would not\nhave affected our conclusions nor have had any significant\nimpact on computing time.\n3.2.3.2. Advance and Retreat\n[42] By shifting the ELA accordingly, the glaciers were\nforced to either advance or retreat. In contrast to the altitude\nfeedback-independent case discussed in section 3.2.2, we\ncan now, in principle, expect some model-dependent differ-\nences in cumulative length and volume changes. The\ncalculated cumulative length and volume changes are\nshown in Figures 8 and 9 for both models. Differences in\ncalculated lengths larger than one grid size of the SIA model\nare only obtained for the small glacier (2 grid cells, 1.2% of\nthe glacier length). Figure 9 shows the difference in cumu-\nlative volume change. Again, only for the small glacier can\nsignificant volume differences be seen (\u000117.5% of the final\nvolume). Where differences are found, the SIA model\nproduces a larger advance and a shorter retreat than the\nfull-system model (Figure 8a).\n[43] As a fraction of the original steady state length, the\ncumulative length change is largest for the medium-sized\nglacier and smallest for the large glacier. This is also\nreflected in the fractional volume changes (Figures 8 and\n9, right vertical axis).\n[44] The relative length and volume changes for the\nadvance and the retreat from the initial steady states are\nshown in Table 2. For an advance the relative volume\nchange is slightly larger than for a retreat. This difference\nbetween volume gain and volume loss for the same absolute\nshift in ELA is model-dependent and turns out to be larger\nfor the SIA model than for the full-system model. In\nnumbers, these differences are 18%, 13%, and 5% for the\nsmall, medium, and the large glacier, respectively, when\ncalculated with the SIA model. Using the full-system\nmodel, the corresponding numbers are 10%, 13%, and 4%.\n[45] Following the evolution of the front position and the\nvolume with time (Figures 8 and 9), we see that for both\nmodels, ignoring the initial phase, the rate of advance and\nretreat and the rate of volume change of the medium-sized\nand large-sized glaciers are identical (Figures 10b and 10c).\nFor the small glacier, however, a significant model-depen-\ndent difference in volume change rate is observed over most\nof the adjustment period (Figure 10a). For this glacier the\ninclusion of horizontal stresses in the force balance leads to\nelevation changes that, when combined with the mass\nbalance altitude rate function, causes noticeable differences\nin rates of advance and retreat (see Figures 8a and 9a). For\nall three prototypes the volume decrease rates are higher\nthan the volume increase rates.\n[46] The time span needed for a glacier to find a new\nsteady state after a change in mass balance (Figures 8 and 9)\nis quantified by the (asymptotic) response time, which can\nbe defined as the time constant in an exponential asymptotic\napproach to a final steady state after a sudden change in\nclimate to a new constant climate [Jo\u00b4hannesson, 1997]. The\nvolume e folding time is the time it takes for the glacier\nvolume perturbation \u0002V to reach e\u00061 (retreat) or 1 \u0006 e\u00061\n(advance) of its final steady state value, i.e.,\u0002V =\u0002V1(1\u0006\ne\u0006t\/tV), where \u0002V1 is the volume perturbation in the limit\nt ! 1. In general, the e folding time and the asymptotic\nFigure 7.

We estimated both the e\nfolding time and the asymptotic response time but found the\ne folding time to be easier to determine as the change in\nvolume and length as a function of time was often far from\nbeing exponential. In the following, if not otherwise stated,\nthe \u2018\u2018response\u2019\u2019 times are e folding times.\n[47] Because of mass conservation, the glacier volume\nmust always immediately start to change following an\nabrupt shift in mean cumulative mass balance. The glacier\nlength, on the other hand, may only start to react to mass\nbalance changes after an initial time lag (the length time\nlag). In all model runs the length time lag was always much\nshorter than the length response time, and no attempt was\nmade to determine it accurately or to subtract the length\ntime lag from the e folding time.\n[48] In Table 3 the e folding times of each glacier are\nlisted for an advance and a retreat and for both the full-\nsystem and the SIA models. Table 3 shows that the volume\nresponse time (tVn) is shorter than the length response time\n(tLn) for all three glaciers, in agreement with the findings of\nSchmeits and Oerlemans [1997] for their one-dimensional\nSIA flow line model of Unterer Grindelwaldgletscher. For a\nretreat, these differences in volume and length response\ntimes are even bigger.\n[49] Ignoringmassbalancealtitude feedback, Jo\u00b4hannesson\net al.

[1989a, 1989b]. Oerlemans [2001] has suggested a\nresponse time for glacier length including mass balance\nfeedback which bears strong similarities to the Harrison\ntimescale [Oerlemans, 2001, equation (9.15)] and finds that\nincluding mass balance feedback may easily double or triple\nthe response time.\n[53] This effect of surface elevation on the response time\ncan be shown by calculating both Harrison\u2019s and Jo\u00b4hannes-\nson\u2019s theoretical response times with the same averaged\nspecific mass balance _be = \u0006 _bt and the same thickness scale\nH. To investigate the significance of the chosen thickness\nscale, we calculate both timescales with H = \u0002V\/\u0002A as\nchosen by Harrison et al. [2001] and H = hmax as chosen by\nJo\u00b4hannesson [1997]. In our case, H = \u0002V\/\u0002A is 10\u201330%\nlarger than H = hmax. The theoretical response times, calcu-\nlated for both an advance and a retreat from the initial steady\nstate, obtained from the two numerical models for all three\nglaciers are shown in Tables 4 and 5, along with the\nnumerical response times. Comparing the numerical re-\nsponse times with the ones from Jo\u00b4hannesson [1997] calcu-\nlated withH = hmax and the ones from Harrison et al. [2001],\ncalculated with H = \u0002V\/\u0002A, we find that the Jo\u00b4hannesson\n[1997] response times are generally smaller and that the\nHarrison et al. [2001] response times are generally larger\nthan the numerical response times. Closer investigation of\nthe response times shows that the advance and the retreat,\nexcept for the small glacier, are best described byHarrison et\nal. [2001] response time tVh with the thickness scale H =\nhmax. The small glacier is best described by Jo\u00b4hannesson\u2019s\n[1997] response time tVj with H = hmax. The Harrison et al.\n[2001] response times calculated withH =\u0002V\/\u0002A tend to be\nlarger than the numerical volume response times but show\ngood agreement with the length response times for the small\nand the large glacier (Table 3). Note that a change in\nthickness scale has a larger effect on tVh than on tVj. We\nfind that ignoring the altitude dependency of the mass\nbalance (using an x-dependent mass balance function) results\nin response times similar to, albeit somewhat shorter than,\nthe theoretical estimate given by equation (5).\n[54] By comparing the numerical response times\n(Tables 3, 4, and 5) for the advance and the retreat, it can\nbe seen that, with one exception, the response times are\nshorter for the retreat than for the advance. This is in\nagreement with the results discussed above and shown in\nTable 2 and Figure 10. The theoretical response times\ncalculated both with H = hmax show only negligible differ-\nences between a retreat and an advance.\n[55] From Table 3 we see that both the SIA and the full-\nsystem models give similar volume response times tVn, with\nthe exception of the small glacier, where significant model-\ndependent differences are observed. The small glacier\nshows that numerical response times tVn calculated from\nthe SIA model are 8% smaller for the advance and 15%\nsmaller for the retreat than those obtained from the full-\nsystem model. For the small glacier the theoretical response\ntimes are compared to the numerical response times\nobtained from the full-system model. The theoretical\nJo\u00b4hannesson [1997] response time tVj calculated with H =\nhmax (Tables 4 and 5) for the small glacier results in\nresponse times which are 10% smaller for the advance\nand 8% larger for the retreat than the numerical response\ntimes (14% and 22% larger when calculated with H =\n\u0002V\/\u0002A). The theoretical Harrison et al. [2001] response\ntime tVh with H = \u0002V\/\u0002A results in 52% (advance) and\n56% (retreat) larger response times than those obtained by\nthe numerical method (12% and 33% smaller when calcu-\nlated with H = hmax). This example shows that the response\ntimes depend not only on the chosen formulation of\ntimescale but also on the thickness scale H. For the two\nlarger glaciers the response time tVn is insensitive to\ndifferences between the full-system and the SIA model.\nThis supports the result of Greuell [1992] that the effect of\nlongitudinal stress gradients on the response times is small.\n3.2.4. Short-Term Mass Balance Perturbation\n[56] In the previous set of experiments we investigated\nmodel-dependent differences in the calculated response of\nalpine glaciers when the ELA is abruptly shifted. Those step\nchanges in mass balance were large. Small-scale fluctuations\nare superimposed on the large-scale fluctuations of the climate\nsignal. The question arises, How do the two models compare\nwhen the evolution of a short-term mass balance perturba-\ntion is calculated? To investigate this, we now consider\nperturbations in the mass balance distribution that are\nconfined to a local area and are of limited temporal duration.\n[57] In a first experiment a perturbation is added to the\nstandard altitude-dependent mass balance function for the\nfirst 5 years. An example of a spatially localized mass\nbalance perturbation \u0002_b is a Gaussian-shaped bulge:\n\u0002_b \u00bc Bexp \u0006 1\n2\nx\u0006 xo\ns\n\u0004 \u00052\u0006 \u0007\n: \u00f07\u00de\nThe mean position of the perturbation peak (xo) is assumed\nto be in the middle of the accumulation area. B is the\namplitude and s is the width of the perturbation. As\nbefore, the model runs start from a steady state config-\nuration. At the beginning of the model run the mass\nbalance perturbation \u0002_b is added to the altitude-dependent\nmass balance. The calculations were carried out for the\nsmall and the large glacier using B = 4 m a\u00061 and s = 5%\nof the initial steady state glacier length. Figure 11 shows\nthe resulting evolution of volumes and front positions.\n[58] For the small glacier the maximum in volume and\nlength is reached 6.5 and 9 years earlier in the SIA model\nthan in the full-system model, respectively (Figure 11). This\nresult may be due to the fact that at spatial scales that are\nshort compared with the mean ice thickness, harmonic\nsurface undulations decay much faster in a SIA model than\nin a full-system model [Gudmundsson, 2003].\n[59] For the large glacier, both models showed almost\nidentical temporal volume and length changes (Figure 11c\nand 11d). Using a smaller amplitude of 2 m a\u00061 and a larger\nhalf width of 10% gave similar results.\n[60] In a second experiment in which the ELAwas lowered\ntemporarily by 250 m for 5 years, both models produced\nessentially identical transient changes in volumes and lengths\nfor both glaciers. This finding demonstrates nicely that for\nspatially uniform perturbations in mass balance forcing the\nSIA appears sufficiently accurate to calculate the effects of\nshort-term climatic variations on alpine glaciers.\n[61] Recapitulating, we find that for localized surface\ndisturbances the overall adjustment is slower when calcu-\nF01007 LEYSINGER VIELI AND GUDMUNDSSON: ESTIMATING GLACIER FLUCTUATIONS\n11 of 14\nF01007\nlated by the full-system model than by the SIA model. On\nthe other hand, for glacier-wide changes in mass balance\nsuch as those resulting from a uniform shift in ELA the\ntemporal behavior is essentially model-independent. Both of\nthese findings can be understood in terms of the differences\nbetween the relaxation spectrum of the SIA model and the\nfull-system model. Localized surface disturbances decay\nfaster in a SIA model than in a full-system model. This is\nto be expected. By linearizing both models, it can be shown\n[Gudmundsson, 2003] that these models give rise to decay\ntimes that differ by several orders of magnitude at short\nspatial scales, with the SIA model giving estimates for the\ndecay timescale that are too short.\n4. Discussion\n[62] The two models differ in their treatment of the\nmechanics of glacier flow. The SIA leads to considerable\nsimplifications of the underlying set of equations, and the\npicture of glacier mechanics that emerges from that approx-\nimation is simple. The full-system model, on the other hand,\ngives a full description of the mechanics of glacier flow for\nthe particular set of assumptions about basal conditions and\nrheological properties of ice used here.\n[63] The first suite of experiments with the rectangles\nshowed that despite the velocities at the snout being very\ndifferent for the two models (Figure 4), and despite the\nSIA model velocities not being independent of grid size\n(tending toward infinity as the grid size goes to zero),\nthe front position given by the SIA agrees well with the\nposition calculated with a full-system model (Figure 1).\nFurthermore, the model-model comparison shows that\nthe advance rates of the snout, calculated with the two\nnumerical models, are almost identical (Figure 3). The\nsecond modeling suite demonstrates that this observed\nmodel independence of the advance and retreat rates is also\nvalid for most realistic alpine glacier geometries.\n[64] This model independence of the snout position and\nadvance and retreat rates can be understood in terms of mass\ncontinuity. Although at any particular point in time the rate\nof advance of the snout may depend on the details of the\nvelocity profile and the shape of the surface at the snout, the\nmean advance of the snout over extended time periods must\nultimately be related to the vertically integrated mass flux\nsome distance behind the front. Particularly when ice\nmasses are close to steady state, one would therefore expect\nlength changes to be related to the integrated imbalance in\nmass fluxes along the whole surface of the glacier and not to\ndepend on the details of the flow field at the snout. As\nshown in this paper, for both models the calculated rates of\nadvance and retreat are almost identical, although their\ndescription of flow dynamics close to the snout is funda-\nmentally different. With respect to the reaction of the\nglaciers to shifts in ELA, the choice of the model is\nimportant only for the small glacier and even then only\nwhen an altitude-dependent mass balance function is used.\n[65] In this study, any possible basal motion has been\nignored, and we can only speculate how including it would\nlead to differences between the two numerical models\nconsidered. Increased basal sliding leads to enhanced spatial\ntransmission of stress gradients [Gudmundsson, 2003].\nSince the SIA model does not account for the effects of\nhorizontal stress transmission, this suggests that model-\ndependent differences will become increasingly important\nas the slip ratio (ratio between mean sliding and mean\ndeformational velocity) becomes larger. For alpine glaciers\na moderate slip ratio of about 1 seems to be a typical value\n[Gudmundsson et al., 1999; Gudmundsson, 2003]. For Haut\nGlacier d\u2019Arolla (Switzerland), Pattyn [2002] finds that\nintroducing basal sliding does not lead to any significant\ndifferences between a higher-order and a zero-order model\nfor the one particular glacier geometry studied. Pattyn\n[2002] used an altitude-independent mass balance distribu-\ntion, and for that reason, no differences in steady state\nglacier lengths were to be expected.\n[66] For any calculation of the reaction of glaciers to\nchanges in climate a model describing the rate of mass\nexchange at the surface is needed in addition to a model\ndescribing the mechanics of glacier flow. Given the insig-\nnificant differences between the two mechanical models\nwith regard to rates of advance and retreat, the question now\narises if the description of glacier mechanics is less impor-\ntant than the description of mass balance.\n[67] Away of giving a precise meaning to this question is\nto consider whether the rheological parameters of one of\nthe models could possibly be changed in such a way as to\nmake the predictions of that model identical to those of the\nother. If that can be done, the simpler model of the two\n(SIA model) will lead to predictions just as accurate as the\nmore complex one (full-system model), and there is no\nneed to introduce the additional level of complexity. This\nwould, however, imply that the rheological parameters\nbecome model-dependent quantities, in which case their\nvalues will no longer reflect the true rheology of glacier ice.\nThis is clearly a drawback, but given the way numerical\nmodels are, in practice, currently tuned, this is not a major\nconcern.\nFigure 11. (a and c) Volume and (b and d) length changes\nas a function of time after a small mass balance perturbation\nhas been added to the accumulation area during the first\n5 years of model runtime. Figures 11a and 11b show results\nfor the small glacier, and Figures 11c and 11d show results\nfor the large glacier. The changes calculated with the full-\nsystem model are shown with solid lines, and the ones with\nthe SIA model are shown with dash-dotted lines.\nF01007 LEYSINGER VIELI AND GUDMUNDSSON: ESTIMATING GLACIER FLUCTUATIONS\n12 of 14\nF01007\n[68] We could also ask what changes in ELA are needed\nto produce the observed model-dependent changes in gla-\ncier lengths. Both the rate factor A = 2 \b 10\u000624 s\u00061 Pa\u00063\nand ELA = 2801 m were changed by amounts of \u0002A or\n\u0002ELA needed for the SIA model to reach the same\nsteady state length as the full-system model. The required\nchange in the flow parameter \u0002A is approximately \u000658.5%\n(\u00061.17 \b 10\u000624 s\u00061 Pa\u00063) for the small, \u000612.5% (\u00060.25 \b\n10\u000624 s\u00061 Pa\u00063) for the medium-sized, and \u00068.5%\n(\u00060.17 \b 10\u000624 s\u00061 Pa\u00063) for the large glacier. The shift\n\u0002ELA is approximately \u00068 m for the small, \u00063.2 m for\nthe medium-sized, and \u00063.6 m for the large glacier. Given\nthe uncertainties in estimated values for the rate factor\nfor temperate ice (factor of 2\u20133), typical uncertainties in\ndetermination of ELA (tens of meters), and the annual\nnatural fluctuation of ELA (on the order of hundreds of\nmeters), these numbers allow us to conclude that the\nuncertainty in the rate factor, and especially the uncertainty\nin the mass balance, are much larger than the uncertainties\nintroduced by the model assumptions. This supports the\nconclusion of Greuell [1992] that steady state simulations\nof real glaciers are expected to suffer more from the\nuncertainty in surface mass balance than from the assump-\ntions of the flow model [e.g., Oerlemans, 2001].\n[69] Although the aspect ratios (d) of glaciers are\nconsiderably larger than for ice sheets, the effects of\nhorizontal stress transmission on the frontal advance speed\nof glaciers are small. The transient evolution of small-scale\nfeatures (comparable to or smaller than mean thickness)\nare, on the other hand, significantly different in these two\nmodels. Gudmundsson [2003] showed that at short spatial\nscales the decay times of both models differ by several\norders of magnitude, with the SIA model giving too short\nestimates for the decay timescale. This difference in the\ndecay times is reflected in the model-dependent response\nin volume and front positions following a spatially con-\nfined perturbation in mass balance over a limited period of\ntime (Figure 11). The slower short-scale relaxation in the\nfull-system model is the main reason why the upper-right\ncorners of the rectangular blocks decay so much more\nslowly in the full-system model than in the SIA model\n(Figure 1).\n5. Conclusions\n[70] Length fluctuations of alpine glaciers over timescales\nof more than a few years can be modeled with sufficient\naccuracy using the SIA approximation. There is no need\nto resort to higher-order or full-system models for this\npurpose. Differences in response times calculated with a\nSIA and a full-system model are on the order of a few\nyears. As expected, including mass balance altitude feed-\nback increases response times, but response times for both\nadvance and retreat remain on the order of decades to\nhundreds of years. Recent analytical models seem to over-\nestimate the effect of mass balance altitude feedback on\nresponse times.\n[71] Acknowledgments.
