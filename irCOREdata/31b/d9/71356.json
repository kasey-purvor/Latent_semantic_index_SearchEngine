(JA)2\n(2) I was so young then like and er me brother took the opportunity and he went. (HF)\n(3) when I was four I used to go round this house with my eyes closed. (RG)\n(4) I remember my father coming out a small room. (CS)\nAs is obvious from the transcription of example (2), there is variation in the realization\nof the possessive pronoun: while it is realized as [maI] in (1), in (2) we find the shorter\nform [mi]. Examples (3)\u2013(4) display additional reduced variants: in (3) the realization\nis [ma], in (4) we get [m\u00b4]. (Since, unlike in the case of [mi], there is no conventional\nway to represent them as distinct from [maI], the conventional spelling my is\nretained.)\nIt is not clear whether in the speakers\u2019 grammars the form me is essentially the\nsame form as the objective personal pronoun. There would be some evidence for this\n1 We are grateful to two anonymous reviewers for their comments on this article. All remaining errors are of\ncourse our own.\n2 The provenance of the Lancashire examples in this article is the North West Sound Archive (NWSA). The\nspeakers\u2019 names are represented as initials. More details about our corpus will be given in section 3 of the main\ntext.\n408 W I L L E M H O L L M A N N A N D A N NA S I E W I E R S K A\nhypothesis if in our corpus we found us used as the 1PL possessive, but that is the case\nfor only one speaker:\n(5) But if we had er us clothes wet . . . (ED)\nThe status of [m\u00b4] is also uncertain. Given that schwa is the vowel that requires least\narticulatory effort, it may be a reduced form of any or all of the three other variants.\nFor the purpose of this article we will remain agnostic with regard to these aspects of\nthe status of these forms \u2013 we will analyse [maI] as the fullest variant and the other\nforms as reduced, with [m\u00b4] being more reduced than [mi] and [ma].\nThe purpose of this article is to account for the variation in the realization of\nthe 1SG possessive pronoun, both across and within speakers. Taking our cue from\nthe typological literature on (in)alienability effects (see section 2 below), we will\nshow that reduction is more frequent in constructions where the noun is a kinship\nor body-part term (see example (2\u20134) and (3), respectively) than where it is not\n(see example (1)). This is a remarkable finding inasmuch as English has never been\ncharacterized as a language where (in)alienability plays a structural role. Contrary\nto traditional work in typology, we will not automatically assume that this effect is\nbased on iconicity (the closeness of the relation between possessor and possessed;\nsee e.g. Haiman, 1985) but instead investigate the possibility that the underlying\nfactor may be token frequency, i.e. of the possessor\u2013possessed strings in question (for\nthe correlation between token frequency and morphophonological reduction see the\nusage-based work by e.g. Berkenfield, 2001; Bybee & Scheibman, 1999; Fidelholtz,\n1975; Hooper, 1976; Schuchardt, 1885; Zipf, 1935). In this connection we will be\ndrawing on Haspelmath (2006b), who has shown that a frequency-based account\nof possessor encoding makes better predictions than a more traditional view based\non the semantics of (in)alienability. Some aspects of the variation observed are not\neasy to explain in terms of the token frequencies of the patterns in question \u2013 at\nleast not if we define token frequency in absolute terms, i.e. as the raw frequency\nof a given pattern. Despite the fact that many studies in the usage-based approach\n(including all the ones mentioned above) rely on absolute frequencies, there is a long\ntradition in linguistics \u2013 going back at least to Jespersen (1923) \u2013 that argues that\nfrequencies of certain patterns must be evaluated relative to other frequencies. The\nwork on reduction phenomena by Jurafsky and his colleagues is a good, and more\nrecent, example. In a study on lenition in ten frequent function words (not including\nmy) by Jurafsky, Bell, Fosler-Lusier, Girana & Raymond (1998) predictability is one\nof the factors studied. Predictability is operationalized in their study as the conditional\nprobability that a certain word will occur given the two words immediately preceding\nit. Predictability is found to be a significant factor (although, surprisingly, for the\nfunction words I and you, Jurafsky et al. find the opposite effect: high predictability\nleads to less rather than more reduction; see 1998: 3113). Haspelmath\u2019s (2006b) study\nis especially relevant to our study. He assesses the frequency of nouns occurring in the\npossessive relative to their occurrence in all other constructions. This method appears\nto explain some of the data better, although some other aspects of the data seem\nA C O N S T RU C T I O N G R A M M A R AC C O U N T O F P O S S E S S I V E S\nI N L A N C A S H I R E D I A L E C T\n409\nmore susceptible to an analysis in absolute not relative terms.3 An alternative solution\noffered here is to adopt the construction grammar notion of schemas (see e.g. Croft,\n2001; Goldberg, 1995; Langacker, 1987). Since the data that we have at our disposal\nhere cannot but lead us to equivocate between absolute\/relative token frequencies and\nschemas as the most appropriate explanation, we conclude that further research is\ncalled for to shed light on these aspects of the usage-based model and construction\ngrammar.\nThe structure of the article is as follows. Section 2 throws the present study into\ncrosslinguistic relief, showing how in many languages of the world (in)alienability\ndoes have structural implications. In section 3 we describe our corpus, and discuss\nthe way in which we coded and retrieved the data. Section 4 presents the results, and\ndiscusses them in terms of (in)alienability, token frequency (absolute and relative), and\nschemas. Section 5 ends the discussion with some general conclusions and pointers for\nfuture research.\n2 (In)Alienability effects in the languages of the world\nA number of crosslinguistic studies of substantival possession (e.g. Chappell &\nMcGregor, 1996a; Heine, 1997; Nichols, 1988; Seiler, 1983; Ultan, 1978) have\nshown that one of the major factors underlying how this relation is expressed is\n3 Another approach that sets out to go beyond raw frequencies is the collocational method, developed and used\nlargely within British corpus linguistics (see e.g. Hoey, 2005; Renouf & Sinclair, 1991; Sinclair, 1991; Stubbs,\n1996, 2001; for a useful overview of methods for calculating collocational strength see Oakes, 1998: 162\u201393).\nA recent addition to the corpus-based approach to associations between words and constructions in particular is\nthe so-called collostructional method, pioneered by Stefanowitsch & Gries (2003). In using this method to assess\nthe frequency of a word W in construction C not only is the raw frequency of this pattern considered, or just this\nfrequency in combination with the frequency of W in all other constructions, but also the frequency of C with\nother words, and the total frequency of other constructions that do not contain W. These frequencies are entered\ninto a table and some distributional test, preferably the Fisher exact test (see Stefanowitsch & Gries, 2003: 217\u2013\n18 for the reasoning behind this), is then used to compute the measure of association of W in C. The present\nauthors are impressed with the fact that at least in the case of one construction (the English as-predicative:\nsee Gries, Hampe & Scho\u00a8nefeld, 2005, to appear) this method of analysis makes better predictions concerning\nthe degree of association between the words in that construction and the construction itself than is possible on\nthe basis of relative frequencies as defined by e.g. Haspelmath (2006b) and in the main text. However, there\nis one aspect of collostructional analysis that makes us unsure about its value in relation to our possessives\ndata. Stefanowitsch & Gries (2003) and Gries et al. (2005) focus on a number of verbal constructions, where\nthe association between different verbs and such constructions is calculated. In all cases the total number of\nconstructions that do not include the verb in question is \u2018approximate[d] by using the token frequency of all\nverbs\u2019 (Gries et al., 2005: 645). The problem here is that it is not apparent to us what, in our case, constitutes\nthe correct level of generalization in terms of the constructions to use: all possessed NPs? All definite NPs?\nAll NPs with initial determiners? All common NPs? All NPs including pronominals? In fact it is also not fully\nclear to us exactly what in the analysis of verbal constructions it means to \u2018approximate\u2019 the number of relevant\nconstructions. There are often multiple verbs within phrases \u2013 should these indeed all be counted or, depending\non the construction, should some attempt be made to differentiate between main and auxiliary verbs? We would\nvery much like to see the sophisticated triangulation method of Gries et al. (2005, to appear) being used to\ndecide empirically between these slightly different ways of calculating collostructional strength.\n410 W I L L E M H O L L M A N N A N D A N NA S I E W I E R S K A\nthe distinction between alienable and inalienable possession. Inalienable possession\nis generally seen as involving a fairly stable relation over which possessors have little\nor no control, alienable possession as comprising a variety of less permanent, more\ncontrolled relationships. Whether the relationship between the possessor and possessed\nis alienable or inalienable depends to some extent on the possessor (only humans and\nhigher animates are typically seen as capable of exerting control) but primarily on the\nsemantic properties of the possessed. Most commonly the inalienable nouns encompass\nsome set of nouns referring to body parts, kinship terms, spatial terms and part\u2013whole\nrelations. The inalienable\/alienable distinction may affect the formal realization of the\npossessor and possessed in several ways all of which concern the linguistic proximity\nbetween the possessor and the possessed. If there is a difference between inalienable and\nalienable possession in this respect, it is always the case that the possessor and possessed\nare located closer to each other in inalienable possession than in alienable possession.\nThis is typically attributed to the workings of iconicity (Croft, 2003; Haiman, 1985;\nHaspelmath, 2005), in particular the iconicity of distance, i.e. the tendency for the\nconceptual distance between concepts to be reflected in the linguistic distance between\nthe linguistic expressions of these concepts.\nOf the various manifestations of the iconicity of distance with regard to alienable\nand inalienable possession, only those involving person forms are of relevance to the\ncurrent discussion. Assuming that proximity of forms is a precondition for fusion, as\nsuggested by the grammaticalization literature (see e.g. Hopper & Traugott, 2003: 8\u201313\nfor some examples of periphrastic constructions coalescing over time), a particularly\ncommon reflection of the greater conceptual proximity between the possessor and\npossessed in inalienable constructions than in alienable ones involves person marking\nof the possessor on the possessed. If a language employs some type of bound person\nmarking (by means of affixes, clitics or weak forms) of the possessor on the possessed\nwith alienable nouns, it also uses such bound person marking with inalienable nouns,\nbut not necessarily vice versa. Observe, for example, the presence of a person\nsuffix on the possessed in (6a) as compared to the use of an independent person\nform in (6b) in Hoava, an Austronesian language spoken in the Western Solomon\nIslands.\n(6) Hoava (Davis, 2003: 98, 105)\n(a) sa kalu-na\nART hair-3SG\n\u2018his hair\u2019\n(b) nana siki\n3SG:POSS dog\n\u2018his dog\u2019\nA similar contrast is to be found in Paamese and many other Oceanic languages, in\nwhich bound person possessors are used in both alienable and inalienable constructions,\nbut while in the inalienable construction the bound person possessor is attached to the\npossessed (7a), in the alienable construction it is attached to a special classifier (7b)\nrather than the possessed.\nA C O N S T RU C T I O N G R A M M A R AC C O U N T O F P O S S E S S I V E S\nI N L A N C A S H I R E D I A L E C T\n411\n(7) Paamese (Crowley, 1996: 389, 411)\n(a) vati-n\nhead-3SG\n\u2018his head\u2019\n(b) ani emo-n\ncoconut CLF-3SG\n\u2018his drinking coconut\u2019\nThus, the possessor and possessed are closer together linguistically in the inalienable\nconstruction than in the alienable one. In contrast to Hoava and Paamese, Udihe, a\nTungusic language of the Russian Far East, displays bound person marking of the\npossessor on the possessed in both inalienable and alienable possession. There is\nnonetheless a difference in the linguistic proximity of the possessor and possessed in\nthe two constructions in line with the iconicity of distance. In inalienable posses-\nsion the bound person possessor is directly affixed to the possessed, in alienable\npossession the two are separated from each other by the additional suffix -ni. Compare\n(8a) and (8b).\n(8) Udihe (Nikolaeva & Tolskaya, 2001: 481, 505)\n(a) bi anda-i\n1SG friend-1SG\n\u2018my friend\u2019\n(b) nuani ja:-ni-ni\n3SG cow-AL-3SG\n\u2018his cow\u2019\nThus the linguistic distance between the bound person possessor and possessed is\nshorter in the inalienable construction than in the alienable one.\nMorphological fusion of the possessor and possessed as illustrated above is\noften preceded or accompanied by phonological reduction of the possessor. It\nshould therefore come as no surprise that the other common manifestation of the\nalienable\/inalienable opposition with respect to person forms concerns the phonological\nsize of the possessor. In languages exhibiting differences in the form of the person\nmarkers found in alienable and inalienable possession it is typically the case that\nthe forms used in inalienable possession are shorter or morphologically simpler than\nthose which occur in alienable possession. This is obviously so in languages in which\nalienable constructions require the presence of a free pronoun while inalienable ones\nhave person markers attached to the possessed, the latter being invariably shorter\nthan free forms. Recall the situation in Hoava illustrated in (6) above. But the same\ndifference may involve bound person forms. Nichols (1988: 564) states that among\nthe languages in her corpus which use bound person forms in both alienable and\ninalienable possession, the ones which occur in inalienable constructions are shorter\nthan the ones found in alienable constructions. A case in point is Paumari, an Arauan\nlanguage spoken in the State of Amazonas in Brazil, which uses the prefixes in (9a)\nfor alienable possession and the discontinuous prefix and suffix in (9b) for inalienable\npossession.\n412 W I L L E M H O L L M A N N A N D A N NA S I E W I E R S K A\n(9) Paumari (Chapman & Derbyshire, 1991: 256\u20137)\n(a) 1SG kodi- (b) 1SG o- -na\n2SG kada- 2SG i- -ni\n3SG kidi- 3SGF \u00d8- -ni\nGEN ka- 3SGM \u00d8- -na\n1PL akadi- 1PL a- -na\n2PL avakadi- 2PL ava- -ni\n3PL vakadi- 3PL va- -na\nNeedless to say, this crosslinguistic tendency for person forms in inalienable possession\nto be phonologically reduced relative to those found in alienable possession plays a\nmajor role in our analysis of the factors underlying the realization of first person\nsingular in Lancashire dialect.\nIn discussing the formal reflexes of the alienable\/inalienable distinction we have side\nstepped the issue of the type of nouns that tend to emerge as inalienable. Crosslinguistic\ninvestigations clearly show that there is quite some variation in this regard. Nonetheless,\nseveral linguists, most notably Seiler (1983: 13), Haiman (1985: 136), Nichols (1988),\nand Chappell & McGregor (1996b: 26), have suggested that the type of nouns most\nlikely to be inalienable may be seen to form a typological hierarchy. For example,\nNichols (1988: 572; 1992: 160) has suggested the inalienability hierarchy in (10).4\n(10) The inalienability hierarchy\nbody parts and\/or kinship terms > part\u2013whole > spatial relations > culturally basic\npossessed items > other\nThe inalienability hierarchy is slightly unusual as far as typological hierarchies are\nconcerned, in that it is headed jointly by two items, body parts and kin terms, connected\nby an inclusive disjunction. The \u2018or\u2019 part is a reflection of the fact that there are\nlanguages in which only body parts are treated as inalienable (e.g. Dizi, Paumari, Tauya,\nWorora) and also languages in which only kin terms emerge as such (e.g. Dongolese\nNubian, Mumuye, and Wappo). The \u2018and\u2019 part, in turn, caters for the languages in\nwhich inalienability embraces exclusively just body parts and kin terms (e.g. Haida,\nMaung, Washo, and Yuchi).\nThe alternative categorizations of inalienability captured in the inalienability\nhierarchy suggest that reflexes of the alienable\/inalienable distinction may well be\nmore diverse and widespread than has been previously assumed. It is precisely in this\nspirit that we approach our dialect data.\n3 The corpus\nThe corpus is made up of twenty-six interviews with different speakers which we\nobtained from the North West Sound Archive.5 After we had them transcribed, we had\n4 Unlike some other scholars, Nichols (1988) considers the alienable\/inalienable opposition to be lexical rather\nthan semantic.\n5 See http:\/\/www.gmcro.co.uk\/other\/NWSA\/nwsa.htm (12 October 2005); cf. also Siewierska & Hollmann\n(2007).\nA C O N S T RU C T I O N G R A M M A R AC C O U N T O F P O S S E S S I V E S\nI N L A N C A S H I R E D I A L E C T\n413\nTable 1.

The interviews run to a total of almost 230,000 words, although\nthis includes the interviewer\u2019s (brief) questions as well. The number of words produced\nby the interviewees is around 200,000. While this is a fairly small corpus, the frequency\nof 1SG possessive pronouns, especially in the kind of interviews in the NWSA, means\nit is large enough to draw valid conclusions.\nThe possessive tokens were all tagged according to their phonetic realization ([maI],\n[mi], [ma], [m\u00b4]), as well as for the type of possessed noun (kinship term, body part,\nother). For our searches we used MonoConc Pro.\n4 Results and explanation\n4.1 By-items and by-subjects analysis: the (in)alienability effect\nin Lancashire dialect\nTable 1 presents the results for the entire corpus. Chi-square analysis reveals that the\ndistribution of the data is very highly significant, as the alienability hierarchy (see sec-\ntion 2) would lead us to expect (X2 = 80.71, df = 6, critical value at p \u2264 .001 = 22.46).\nMore specifically, the significant correlations, in order of importance, are the over-\nrepresentation of other nouns with [maI], the under-representation of kin nouns with\n[maI], the under-representation of other nouns with [mI], the over-representation of kin\nnouns with [mi] and finally the over-representation of body-part nouns with [mi]. (If\nthe three reduced forms are collapsed the effect is still significant at the p \u2264 .001 level:\nX2 = 73.76; df = 2, critical value = 13.82.)\nGries (2006) and Hollmann & Siewierska (2006) have argued that in corpus studies\nthe focus is too often on differences between constructions in the corpus as a whole\n(what Gries calls by-items analysis) and not on differences between and within\nindividual speakers (so-called by-subjects analysis). Indeed, a by-subjects analysis\nis very revealing in the present study as well, as we now proceed to show.\nNot all speakers in our corpus have all four variants \u2013 only four of them do. Most\nspeakers have two or three variants, while two speakers consistently use [maI] and one\nalways produces [mi]. If we plot the number of speakers who produce one or several\n414 W I L L E M H O L L M A N N A N D A N NA S I E W I E R S K A\nTable 2.

The \u2013 sign\nmeans that they use the full form. The \u00d8, finally, represents the absence of the given\ncategory in the speech of the speakers in question.\nTable 2 shows that all speakers behave in accordance with the alienability hierarchy.\nAnother interesting way to look at the data is to ask whether there are speakers who\nconsistently produce reduced possessive forms, and for which of the three noun types\nthey do so. Table 3 presents the relevant numbers of speakers.\nAgain, the data pattern in the way that the alienability hierarchy would predict. The\none speaker who always uses the reduced possessive pronoun for body parts but not\nalways for kin terms is not an exception, as these two noun types are not in any way\nordered with respect to each other on the alienability hierarchy.\n4.2 What lies beneath: iconicity or token frequency?\nWe saw in section 2 that (in)alienability effects have often been explained with\nreference to iconicity: possessed entities that are somehow conceptually closer to their\nA C O N S T RU C T I O N G R A M M A R AC C O U N T O F P O S S E S S I V E S\nI N L A N C A S H I R E D I A L E C T\n415\npossessor are coded with less linguistic distance between them. Haspelmath (e.g. 2005,\n2006a) has recently started looking critically at functional-typological notions such as\niconicity and markedness, and has presented strong evidence that the phenomena these\nnotions are supposed to explain are actually more straightforwardly and accurately\naccounted for in terms of frequency. Of particular relevance for the present article is\nHaspelmath\u2019s (2006b) paper, which demonstrates the superiority of a frequency-based\naccount in relation to (in)alienability effects. It is widely recognized, at least among\nlinguists subscribing to the usage-based model (Barlow & Kemmer, 2000; Croft, 2000;\nLangacker, 1987), that high-token-frequency constructions are more likely to undergo\nreduction, and to a higher degree, than rare ones (see section 1 for some references).\nAlmost every relevant study that we are aware of (Jurafsky et al.\u2019s work mentioned in\nsection 1 being a notable exception) defines token frequency in absolute terms. That\nis to say, in order to explain why construction X has undergone more reduction than\nconstruction Y the tokens of each in a corpus are counted, and it is shown that X is more\nfrequent than Y. We may carry out this exercise for our possessives data. In order to\nget a sense of the frequencies in ordinary speech we decided against using our NWSA\ncorpus: the very specific genre of the interviews might have led to undesirable biases\nin terms of the nouns used. Instead, in order to get a handle on token frequencies in\nordinary spoken discourse we used the 10-million word spoken subcorpus of the British\nNational Corpus.6 Table 4 gives the raw frequencies of 1SG possessive constructions\nwith the kinship and body-part terms included in our Lancashire data, and with a\nnumber of other nouns as well. The other nouns consist of two groups. The higher\ngroup of seven nouns are all the nouns in our Lancashire corpus that occur with a\nreduced form of the possessive at least twice, and never with the full form. The lower\ngroup of eighteen nouns are the ones that in our data never feature any reduction, whilst\nalso occurring at least twice.7,8\nTo a large extent the BNC data are as we would expect. The mean frequency of 1SG\npossessive with a kinship noun is 106.65, the median frequency being 38. The mean\nand median frequencies for body-part nouns are 60.00 and 41.5. For the other nouns\n(combining both groups), finally, the respective frequencies are 32.83 and 15. This\nmakes it unsurprising that the kinship and body-part terms should be reduced more\noften in our Lancashire corpus than the other nouns. There is also a difference between\nthe first group of other nouns (which do display some reduction) and the second group\n(which do not): the mean frequencies are 33.29 vs 20.00, the median frequencies 20 vs\n6 The BNC is a 100 million word corpus of spoken and written Present-day English; for more information see\ne.g. Aston & Burnard (1998).\n7 Table 4 only gives the singular forms. If and where plural forms occurred in our data (as in the case of e.g.\nauntie\/aunties), these have been included in the relevant BNC searches as well. In cases where the noun only\noccurred in the plural in our corpus (e.g. grandparents), this is the form we supply in the table. In these cases\nwe restricted our search in the BNC accordingly.\n8 We only include nouns that immediately follow the possessive. Thus, for example, birthday \u2013 which in our\ncorpus occurs as \u2018my twenty-first birthday\u2019 (JA) and \u2018my fourth birthday\u2019 (DG) \u2013 is ignored. The reason for this\ndecision is that here it is not clear whether the reduction (or full realization) of the possessive is due to the noun\nor to the modifier(s). Some nouns (e.g. big toe, right shoulder) we have treated as compounds.\n416 W I L L E M H O L L M A N N A N D A N NA S I E W I E R S K A\nTable 4.

Again, the reduction effects appear to pattern in the way that one expects on the\nbasis of the frequencies. Nonetheless, in light of the low numbers of nouns in each\nof the twin subgroups we would be hesitant to attach too much importance to this\nobservation.\nA C O N S T RU C T I O N G R A M M A R AC C O U N T O F P O S S E S S I V E S\nI N L A N C A S H I R E D I A L E C T\n417\nA few questions emerge as well. The kinship nouns father-in-law, niece, sister-\nin-law, stepfather, stepmother, and stepsister are actually very infrequent, as is the\nbody-part term milk tooth. Yet, despite this, our Lancashire speakers reduce them quite\noften: father-in-law, 1 out of 3 times; niece, 3 out of 3 times; sister-in-law, 3 out of\n3 times; stepfather, 2 out of 2 times; stepmother, 4 out of 4 times; stepsister, 3 out of\n3 times; milk tooth 1 out of 1 time.9 The example containing milk tooth can probably\nbe explained straightforwardly:\n(11) . . . and there was, one of me, this milk tooth must have been, you know, troubling me\nin some way or another. (HF)\nThe speaker may have had in mind the phrase my (or in this case me) teeth, which is\nfrequent (153 tokens in the spoken part of the BNC).\nAs we discussed in section 1, Haspelmath\u2019s (2006b) explanation of (in)alienability\neffects relies on relative not absolute frequencies. Relative frequencies for the kinship,\nbody-part, and other nouns included in table 4 are presented in table 5. The percentages\nshow how often, out of all occurrences of the relevant nouns, they occur in the 1SG\npossessive construction. If the total number of noun tokens falls below 30 it becomes\ndangerous to calculate the relative frequency \u2013 in these cases the table simply reports\nthe total number.10\nInterestingly, it looks as though relative frequencies do a somewhat better job at\nexplaining the \u2018problem case\u2019 niece: the high proportion of this noun occurring in\nthe 1SG possessive construction may have led to its frequent reduction. The spoken\npart of the BNC contains some examples of stepfather, stepmother, and stepsister but\nunfortunately none of them with a 1SG possessive. This does not mean that this pattern\nis not relatively frequent (in the sense of Haspelmath): the total number of examples is\nso low that we cannot predict what kind of percentage would occur in the possessive\nconstruction in question. A larger corpus might be useful in this regard. As regards\nfather-in-law and sister-in-law, here the total number in the BNC of the nouns in\nquestion is too low for the calculation to be entirely reliable. The percentages we get,\ni.e. 37.50 per cent and 34.78 per cent may nevertheless be seen as suggestive. Again, a\nlarger corpus would be desirable.\nRelative frequency does seem to run into a problem in relation to child: while in\nabsolute terms the possessive construction occurs with this noun quite frequently (90\ntokens is almost equal to the mean frequency of the kinship group, i.e. 106.65, and\nconsiderably higher than its median frequency, i.e. 38), the relative frequency drops\nto only 1.85 per cent. One could suggest that the relative frequency of my child in\nthe BNC is not an accurate reflection of the speech of our Lancashire speakers in this\nrespect. After all, about 60 per cent of the spoken part of the BNC is made up of\n9 Grandparents also has a low text frequency but all five examples in our corpus have the full possessive. The\nsole instances of great grandfather, great aunt, nostrils and right shoulder also co-occur with a full possessive.\n10 Many of the words in question occur not only as nouns but also as verbs, adjectives or adverbs.

In these spheres one might\nperhaps reasonably expect speakers to refer less to their own children, and more to\nchildren in relation to education, legal issues, and so on. However, even if we filter out\nthe texts in question (the so-called \u2018context-governed\u2019 part of the corpus) and run a\nA C O N S T RU C T I O N G R A M M A R AC C O U N T O F P O S S E S S I V E S\nI N L A N C A S H I R E D I A L E C T\n419\nsearch on the remaining, more informal, conversations of the so-called demographically\nsampled remainder of the spoken subcorpus, the relative frequency does not rise to\nmore than 2.22 per cent (or 2.31 per cent if we further exclude the youngest group\nof under-fifteen-year-olds). This is similar to the median relative frequency for the\ncategory \u2018other\u2019 (i.e. 1.70 per cent), and lower than the mean relative frequency for that\ncategory (4.61 per cent).\nWe conclude that whichever definition of frequency one chooses, a lot of the data\nare accounted for. Token frequency, then, whether absolute or relative, seems a viable\nalternative to an iconicity-based explanation of the Lancashire patterns. In view of\nHaspelmath\u2019s (2006b) findings it would even appear to be preferable.\n4.3 Schemas: type frequency and productivity\nGiven the fairly long tradition, in usage-based linguistics, of relying on absolute, not\nrelative, token frequencies in accounting for reduction phenomena, one may wonder\nwhether there is another way to explain the problem cases identified above, viz.\nthe reduced possessive pronouns with father-in-law, niece, sister-in-law, stepfather,\nstepmother, and stepsister. Taking a construction grammar view of the issue, we argue\nthat there is.\nConstruction grammarians reject the mainstream view of Generative Grammar\nand its derivatives that our linguistic knowledge consists of a lexicon plus separate\ncomponents governing the traditional levels of language, phonology, semantics, syntax\n(and, according to some scholars, morphology and information structure; see Croft &\nCruse, 2004: ch. 9 for an overview of so-called componential models). Instead, our\nknowledge is made up of form\u2013meaning pairings \u2013 i.e. constructions \u2013 of various levels\nof specificity and complexity, ranging from fully specific and simple monomorphemic\nwords to abstract, complex constructions such as, say, the transitive clause construction.\nThe \u2018words and rules\u2019 model is thus replaced by a model with a \u2018uniform representation\nof all grammatical knowledge in the speaker\u2019s mind\u2019 (Croft & Cruse, 2004: 255,\nemphasis in the original).\nZooming in on possessive constructions, the idea is that on the basis of our use\nof and exposure to tokens of 1SG possessive pronoun and possessed noun sequences\nwe build up mental representations such as [my mother], [my head], [my money],\nand so on. As hinted above, these constructions would not only contain phonological\ninformation, but semantic information as well, linking the elements of the linguistic\nstructure (the possessive pronoun and the possessed noun) to our knowledge of what\nit means to \u2018possess\u2019 the relevant entities (viz. mothers, heads, money). All these\nconstructions obviously share some semantic and formal similarity: they all portray\npossessive relations, and they all comprise a possessive and a noun. Human beings\nare very good at recognizing patterns and similarities, and are therefore likely to build\nup more schematic representations that generalize over the various types of possessive\nrelation. Given the semantic similarity between possessive relations involving members\nof kin, they may thus form a schema [my KIN] (likewise for [my BODY PART]). On an even\n420 W I L L E M H O L L M A N N A N D A N NA S I E W I E R S K A\nhigher level an additional schema [my X] may emerge, which is entirely unspecified\nas regards the type of entity possessed. Going back down to the intermediate level\nof [my KIN] and [my BODY PART], one wonders whether there is a parallel schema\nfor the \u2018other\u2019 category, which we will refer to here as [my OTHER]. The case for\nthis schema seems to us less convincing than for kinship terms and body parts, in\nview of the lack of semantic cohesion of the \u2018other\u2019 category: the kinds of entities\nincluded in this category are obviously very diffuse indeed (see e.g. Bybee, 1985:\n118 for the importance of semantic similarity in the emergence of categories). At any\nrate, whether or not such a schema exists is not that relevant to our argument. We\nsuggested in section 4.2 that the relatively high frequency (whether defined absolutely\nor relatively) of most combinations of possessive and kinship or body-part noun leads\nto reduction of the possessive pronoun. Now it is possible that on the basis of these\nfrequent strings speakers abstract a schema for kin and body-part terms that features a\nreduced version of the possessive. To the extent that this is plausible, then given that\nschemas may be productive, that would help explain the formation of strings involving a\nreduced possessive where the possessed noun is not found in the possessive construction\nvery often, such as father-in-law, niece, sister-in-law, stepfather, stepmother, stepsister\n(which are not frequently found in the construction in absolute terms), and child (which\nis infrequently attested in relative terms).11\nIt is important to point out that it is not necessarily the case that every speaker\nundergoes this sort of schema development, and consequent phonological reduction\nof the possessive in the relatively infrequent combinations we have just listed. Once a\nnumber of speakers have gone through this and have started producing these reduced\ntokens, other speakers in the community may simply store them as such. It is not the\npurpose of this article to try and establish when this development may have taken place.\nThe explanation involving schemas is attractive because it allows one to explain\naway the few problem cases encountered with the purely frequency-based perspective\n(in its relative guise and perhaps more strongly in its absolute guise). The notion\nof schemas has proved useful in other studies on productivity as well (for a well-\nknown example consider Goldberg\u2019s (1995) study of novel uses of the caused-motion\nconstruction such as I sneezed the napkin off the table). Yet it, too, is not without\nproblems: the usage-based view of schema productivity raises several hard questions\n(which were also raised, in a different context, in Hollmann, 2003). The extent to\nwhich schemas are productive is said to be a function of the size of the category \u2013 in\nBybee\u2019s terms, of the schema\u2019s \u2018type frequency\u2019 (1985: 132\u20134). The more members\na class already has, the more likely it is to attract new ones. The difficulty lies in\n11 One of the anonymous reviewers suggests that \u2018there is actually no need to invoke \u201cconstruction grammar\u201d\nhere\u2019, going on to point out that \u2018[w]hat must be at work here is simply good old analogy, which nobody ever\nmanaged to explain away\u2019. We fully agree that analogy is at work, but we note that this notion has a central\nplace in the versions of construction grammar associated with Langacker, Croft, Goldberg, and others. This is\nin contrast to many other linguistic theories, where instead of incorporating analogy, there is indeed a concern\nto \u2018explain it away\u2019. Of course, we could choose to invoke analogy without adopting construction grammar,\nbut we feel that it is important to present the status of analogy in this theory as a merit.\nA C O N S T RU C T I O N G R A M M A R AC C O U N T O F P O S S E S S I V E S\nI N L A N C A S H I R E D I A L E C T\n421\nthe definition of high frequency: thus far it has not been determined what counts as\nhigh enough frequency for a class to become productive. The number of constructions\ncategorized by [my KIN] and [my BODY PART] for most speakers will be one or two dozen\nfor each. That may seem like a reasonably high type frequency, but how can we be\nsure? The issue is aggravated by the fact that Bybee argues that if certain members\nof a category have a very high token frequency, then they are unlikely to contribute\nvery much, if at all, to the schema \u2013 instead they are more or less \u2018autonomous\u2019 (see\nBybee, 1985: 129\u201334 for discussion). This is how Bybee\u2019s usage-based model is able\nto explain the observation that, crosslinguistically, irregular patterns are able to resist\nregularization as long as they are sufficiently frequent (e.g. in many languages, the\nparadigm of the verb be). The problem is that the combinations of possessive and\nkinship or body-part noun that underlie the schemas [my KIN] and [my BODY PART]\nare relatively frequent. It is again unclear what would constitute sufficiently high token\nfrequency for a construction to be fully or largely autonomous. Croft & Cruse (2004: ch.\n11), incidentally, are not convinced by Bybee\u2019s evidence for the correlation between\ntoken frequency and autonomy, but unfortunately they do not offer more precision\neither.\n5 Conclusion\nThis article has shown that contrary to received wisdom on the English language, it does\nactually display what may be labelled (in)alienability effects \u2013 at least in its Lancashire\nvariety. The by-subjects analysis in particular made it clear that there is not a single\nspeaker in our corpus whose reduction behaviour in relation to 1SG possessive pronouns\ndoes not follow the well-known (in)alienability hierarchy. Given the privileged position\nof English in terms of the amount of scholarly attention it has received compared to\nother languages, our finding is rather surprising, and it suggests that the recent trend\ntowards putting dialect grammar in a typological perspective (see e.g. Kortmann, 2003;\nKortmann, Herrmann, Pietsch & Wagner, 2005) is likely to be a fruitful one.\nFrom the point of view of linguistic theory the present study has also made some\ninteresting points. First of all, with Haspelmath (2006b) we have shown that frequency\neffects provide an important explanatory tool in language description, so important\nthat the status of more traditional notions, such as in this case iconicity, will merit\ncareful reconsideration. On a more critical note, we observed that the notion of token\nfrequency is still somewhat underdeveloped. We were admittedly able to account for\nthe facts of reduction in Lancashire pretty comprehensively. Slightly better (though not\nperfect) correlations were obtained by using Haspelmath\u2019s (and some others\u2019) relative,\nas opposed to the more widespread absolute, understanding of token frequency. We\nhave argued that construction grammar may provide a framework that allows us to\naccount for the aspects in the data that posed difficulties for the purely frequency-based\napproach. In this respect the model certainly seems attractive. However, here too we\nidentified several theoretical problems, especially concerning the notion of schema\nproductivity and its relation to type and token frequency.\n422 W I L L E M H O L L M A N N A N D A N NA S I E W I E R S K A\nIn order to resolve these theoretical problems it seems obvious that we need some\nappropriate test cases. It will not be easy to find these as it will require a lot of data,\nbut the chances of doing so may improve as the theoretical linguistics community is\ngetting increasingly interested in dialect grammar and new data are forthcoming.\nAuthors\u2019 address:\nDepartment of Linguistics and English Language\nUniversity of Lancaster\nLancaster LA1 4YT\nUK\nw.hollmann@lancaster.ac.uk\na.siewierska@lancaster.ac.uk\nReferences\nAston, G. & L.
