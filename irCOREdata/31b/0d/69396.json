Introduction\nImaging the nighttime sky using all-sky lenses of\n180\u00b0 field of view, called all-sky imaging, has a long\ntradition in atmospheric airglow and auroral science\ndating back more than 50 years to before the\nInternational Geophysical Year in 1957 (cf. [1,2]).\nFundamentally, a single or dual mirror system with\nfocusing lens, or a pure lens, is used to form a round\nimage. If the camera is mounted pointing vertically,\nthen the image is circularly linear in azimuth angle\nabout the camera and radially linear from the image\ncenter in zenith angle with the local horizon appear-\ning around the edge of the circular image [1]. For an\naltitude of 100km, where the maximum brightness\nin auroral emissions typically occurs [2], an all-sky\nimager gives a radial field of view of \u223c500km.\nThe circular all-sky images are generally processed\ninto either geographic coordinates [3] or a regular\nspatial grid of constant size [4], for a chosen altitude.\nUnfortunately, this significantly reduces the image\nspatial resolution of same sized features in the sky\naway fromthe local zenith.This is illustrated inFig. 1,\nwhich shows a regular grid of 0:1\u00b0 latitude and 0:25\u00b0\nlongitude at 100km altitude, corresponding to ap-\nproximately 10 \u00d7 10km squares to within 10%, cover-\ning 5\u00b0 in latitude and 12:5\u00b0 in longitude, for a high\nlatitude site [5]. For CCD technology with its regular\nrectangular array of pixels, the number of pixels con-\ntributing to each trapezoid and therefore the optical\nsignal-to-noise ratio decreases with increasing zenith\nangle.Oneobjective of the designdescribedbelow is to\neliminate this effect. Radic and Andreic [6] and\nAndreic and Radic [7] effectively did this with their\nall-sky single mirror design, which gave constant an-\ngular magnification. However, they did not address\nthe problem of fixed altitude in the sky nor the fact\nthat the camera blocks the local zenith.We solve both\nthese problems together.\n2. Design\nFigure 2 illustrates the transform required to elim-\ninate the all-sky circular distortion and produce a\n0003-6935\/09\/260001-01$15.00\/0\n\u00a9 2009 Optical Society of America\n10 September 2009 \/ Vol. 48, No. 26 \/ APPLIED OPTICS 1\nconstant sky spatial resolution within the image for a\nchosen altitude for a vertically pointing camera [8].\nThe viewmust be mapped from the local zenith angle\n(\u03b8) to the angle subtended at the center of the Earth\n(\u03b5). For a vertically pointing camera, the image will\nremain azimuthally symmetric about the line con-\nnecting the camera to the center of the Earth. For\nthe Earth radius (r) and a user selected altitude\n(h), it is easily shown that [8]\ntan\u00f0\u03b8\u00de \u00bc \u00f0h\u00fe r\u00de sin\u00f0\u03b5\u00de\u00f0h\u00fe r\u00de cos\u00f0\u03b5\u00de \u2212 r : \u00f01\u00de\nTo achieve full all-sky imaging (\u03b8 \u00bc \u000190\u00b0),\n\u03b5 \u2248 \u000110\u00b0. However, by limiting \u03b8 to \u000175\u00b0, which is\noften sufficient for real applications, \u03b5 \u2248 \u00013\u00b0. This of-\nfers significant advantages in terms of mirror man-\nufacturing effort, the use of interference filters and\nfocusing, as discussed below.\nFigure 3(a) is a schematic of a traditional all-sky\nsingle mirror system (top) and the image produced\non a square detector (bottom). Typically, the curva-\nture of the mirror is constant such that the image\nis radially linear in local zenith angle for a vertical\npointing imager. An obvious problem is that the cam-\nera blocks the local zenith (black disk), which is often\nthe most interesting part of the sky for a particular\nimager placement. The constant angular magnifica-\ntion all-sky mirror design by Radic and Andreic [6]\nand Andreic and Radic [7] also suffers from this pro-\nblem. In some designs, a secondary mirror is used,\nallowing the camera to be located somewhere more\nconvenient, but this does not solve the problem of\nzenith blocking. In order to substitute \u03b5 for \u03b8 in Fig. 3\n(a), the curvature of the mirror is adjusted as a func-\ntion of radius for the desired transform altitude\nusing Snell\u2019s law of reflection. Hough and Scourfield\n[9] produced the wide angle no distortion (WAND)\nall-sky mirror system, which implemented Eq. (1).\nHowever, the problem of zenith blocking remained.\nHere we solve this problem.\nA solution to zenith blocking is shown schemati-\ncally in Fig. 3(b). The mirror curvature is such that\nits highest point is not in the center, as is the case in\nFig. 3(a), but forms a doughnut. The negative slope of\nthe mirror surface near the central axis allows rays\nfrom the local zenith to reach the mirror and be re-\nflected into the focusing lens. The hole in the middle\nof the mirror is not relevant to the optics but can be\nused to accommodate the camera if a secondary mir-\nror is implemented. The curvature of the mirror can\nbe arranged such that the image is linear in \u03b8 or \u03b5.\nEither way, the local zenith forms a circle about\nthe center of the detector (black disk), which contains\nno useful information. This cosmetic blemish can be\nremoved by a suitable secondary mirror, as described\nbelow. The fact that the vertical rays come from a cy-\nlinder of finite diameter is of no practical conse-\nquence because the cylinder diameter is small\ncompared to the projection altitude of 100km.\nIf a transform is implemented with a dual mirror\ndesign, great flexibility is afforded and many nonu-\nnique solutions are possible. Three basic classes of\ndual mirror design are possible, with the primary\u2013\nsecondary being convex\u2013convex, concave\u2013concave,\nand convex\u2013conical. Andreic and Radic [10] produced\na near all-sky imager using a single concave mirror.\nThey found that a full 180\u00b0 field of view could not be\nachieved, but failed to realize the problem could be\nsolved by a secondary concave mirror. However, they\nFig. 1.

The data grid corresponds to approxi-\nmately 10 \u00d7 10km trapezoids.\nFig. 2.

This is be-\ncause the convex mirror produces its virtual image\nbehind the mirror surface, whereas the concave mir-\nror has its virtual image in front of the mirror sur-\nface. To achieve the same focus performance, the\nconvex mirror requires the camera\u2013mirror distance\nto be less than a similar concave mirror. All combina-\ntions of convex and concave mirrors were investi-\ngated, but the convex\u2013conical design is easiest to\nmanufacture because one mirror has a pure conical\nsurface and provides the best overall focus by\nmaximizing the camera to virtual image distance,\nas discussed below.\nFigure 4(a) shows a schematic of the dual mirror\nwide angle mirror system (WAMS) for \u03b8 \u2248 \u000190\u00b0.\nThe focusing lens is placed at the system origin.\nFrom an optical point of view, the only fundamental\ndifference between Figs. 3(b) and 4(a) is the cone-\nshaped secondary mirror. However, the secondary\nmirror allows for the incoming vertical rays to be re-\nflected via both mirrors into the center of the lens.\nHence, in this design, the primary mirror performs\nthe transform described by Eq. (1), while the second-\nary removes the cosmetic blemish shown in Fig. 3(b).\nDue to manufacturing limitations, the central image\npixel, which views the apex of the secondary mirror\ncone, may not contain any useful information.\nFigure 4(a) shows that an image radially linear in\n\u03b5 will be produced where the local zenith is in the\nmiddle of the image.\nTable 1 gives the important dimensions in inches\n(1 in: \u00bc2:54 cm) for the WAMS shown in Fig. 4(a).\nReflective optics scale linearly, so the transform is\nunaffected by physical size.

(1:016m) acrylic hemispherical dome. There are\nonly three free parameters, which the user can ma-\nnipulate. First, there is the transform altitude, which\nis set to 100km in Fig. 4(a). As the transform altitude\napproaches infinity, or at least ten Earth radii, the\nprimary mirror automatically assumes the shape\nof a traditional all-sky optic, i.e., constant curvature.\nSecond is the origin-to-secondary mirror apex dis-\ntance, which determines the overall scaling, and is\nset to 18 inches in Fig. 4(a) according to practical\nhousing limitations. Third is maximum value of \u03b5,\nwhich determines the field of view (2\u03b8) from\nEq. (1) and the maximum diameter of both mirrors.\nIn Fig. 4(a), \u03b5 \u00bc 10\u00b0, giving \u03b8 \u00bc 89:9\u00b0 and total field of\nview of 179:8\u00b0. Alternately, \u03b5 \u00bc 3\u00b0, which gives \u03b8 \u00bc\n74:9\u00b0 and total field of view of 149:8\u00b0. The cone angle\nof the secondary mirror is automatically set to ensure\nthat the vertical rays will appear in the center of the\nimage. The secondary is near flat with the cone angle\nof 5\u00b0 (see Table 1). The numerical integration to de-\ntermine the shape of the primary proceeds toward in-\ncreasing diameter (from vertical to horizon rays)\nfrom the y-axis origin with the x-axis starting point\ndetermined by the secondary mirror size [3.17 inches\nin Fig. 4(a)]. The radius of the secondary mirror is\nautomatically set from the user selection of the free\nparameters.\nA few other issues are worth addressing. First, the\nfocal length of the focusing lens has no bearing on the\ntransform described in Eq. (1), provided the angular\nfield of view of the lens is linear with image radius\nfrom the center of the image. Changing the focal\nlengthmerely changes the image size on the detector.\nThe lens field of view (FOV) is given by\nFOV \u00bc 2 tan\u22121\n\u0001\nd\n2f\n\u0002\n; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere d is the detector size and f is the lens focal\nlength [11] and FOV \u00bc 2\u03b5 for WAMS. For a typical\nauroral imager CCD with 512 \u00d7 512 pixels of 25 \u03bcm\nsize square, d \u00bc 12:8mm (nominally \u00bd inch), giving\nf \u00bc 36:3mm for \u03b5 \u00bc 10\u00b0 or f \u00bc 122:1mm for \u03b5 \u00bc 3\u00b0.\nSecond, the aperture of typical focusing lenses can\nbe F1 or better, for moderate cost, whereas the com-\nmercial all-sky lenses are typically F4 or F2.8 at best.\nThe light gathering power of an F1 lens is 16\u00d7 great-\ner than that of F4, a significant advantage for night-\ntime all-sky imaging. Third, since the mirrors are\nachromatic light reflectors, the transform is scale in-\nvariant. Hence the use of arbitrary units in Fig. 4(a).\nThe size of the mirrors is determined by other consid-\nerations, e.g., manufacturing costs and housing lim-\nitations. However, WAMS should be made as large as\nreasonably possible for focusing reasons, as dis-\ncussed below. Fourth, a wavelength selective inter-\nference filter can be inserted at any point between\nthe secondary mirror and focusing lens. Interference\nfilters change the wavelength of their passband\naccording to the angle of incidence as follows:\n\u03bb\u03b5\n\u03bb0\n\u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n1 \u2212\n\u0001\nNm\nNf\n\u0002\n2\nsin2\u00f0\u03b5\u00de\ns\n; \u00f03\u00de\nwhere \u03bb\u03b5 is the wavelength at the angle of incidence\n(\u03b5), \u03bb0 is the wavelength at normal incidence, Nm is\nthe refractive index of the medium (1 for air), and Nf\nis the refractive index of the interference filter (typi-\ncally \u22452). For a typical visible auroral wavelength of\n557:7nm, the shift in filter wavelength is 2:1nm for\n\u03b5 \u2264 10\u00b0, which gives the minimum filter bandwidth to\nview the line emission. This increases to 3:2nm for\nan infrared auroral emission at 844:6nm. Since it\nis uncommon that a narrower bandwidth is required\nfor auroral applications, WAMS requires no addi-\nFig. 4.

If \u03b5 \u2264 3\u00b0 is used, then the minimum filter\nbandwidth reduces to 0.2 and 0:3nm for 557.7 and\n844:6nm, respectively.\nFinally, fifth, a potentially serious limitation of\nWAMS is the issues of focus and astigmatism.\nFollowing the procedure by Radic and Andreic [6],\nFig. 4(b) shows the WAMS surfaces as well as part\nof the locus of apparent radial focus for objects at in-\nfinity. Where the primary mirror has its maximum\ncurvature (near zenith rays) the image appears to\ncome from close behind the mirror surface [6]\n(\u223c \u2212 0:56 in. below the origin), i.e., a total distance\nof \u223c36:8 in. from the focusing lens. Where the pri-\nmary mirror has almost zero curvature (near horizon\nrays) the image appears to come from effectively in-\nfinity (not shown). The secondary mirror does not af-\nfect the apparent focus in the radial direction\nbecause it is perfectly flat in this direction. Hence\nthe focusing lens has to accommodate all object\ndistances from \u223c36:8 in. to infinity. For geophysical\napplications, the horizon is usually the least interest-\ning part of the sky. If the field of view is limited to\n\u03b8 \u00bc \u000175\u00b0, then the image appears to come from\n\u223c \u2212 8:0 in. behind the mirror surface for the maxi-\nmum zenith angle, which is an object distance of\n\u223c45:5 in. from the focusing lens. This significantly\nreduces the focal range to 36.8\u201345.5 in. In addition,\nrestricting the field of view produces a more compact\ndesign [10], as both primary and secondary mirrors\nhave significantly reduced diameters, i.e., less than a\nthird of full size in this case.\nIn the azimuthal direction, both the primary and\nsecondary mirrors have curvature, which varies with\nradius. This should introduce variable astigmatic fo-\ncus as a function of radius. Unfortunately, astigma-\ntism should be worse for WAMS compared to\nconstant curvature all-sky mirrors [7]. For spherical\nmirrors, the focal point for objects at infinity is half\nthe radius of curvature. From Table 1, the primary\nmirror azimuthal focus varies from 1.59 in. for verti-\ncal rays to 5.89 in. for horizon rays. Figure 4(b) shows\nthe locus of apparent azimuthal focus of the primary\nmirror for objects at infinity. It is obvious that the fo-\ncusing lens needs to accommodate a much smaller\nrange of azimuthal focus than the radial focus de-\nscribed above. Given that the primary mirror is close\nto the secondary mirror, and that the secondary mir-\nror has a smaller radius of curvature than the pri-\nmary mirror, the range of azimuthal focus in the\nfinal image is compressed even further. Hence the\nquality of focus is primarily determined by the radial\ndirection. In addition, Radic and Andreic [6] point\nout that astigmatism is likely not a serious problem,\nas each point on the convex primary mirror is asso-\nciated with a different part of the sky. The bundle of\nrays that makes up each point in the image is infini-\ntesimally small, and astigmatism cannot occur for a\nsingle ray. This is borne out by practical experience.\nThe focusing lens has to accommodate apparent\nobjects over a range of distances using its depth of\nfield, expressed as\nDn \u00bc\ncFs\u00f0s \u2212 f \u00de\nf 2 \u00fe cF\u00f0s \u2212 f \u00de ; \u00f04a\u00de\nDf \u00bc\ncFs\u00f0s \u2212 f \u00de\nf 2 \u2212 cF\u00f0s \u2212 f \u00de ; \u00f04b\u00de\nwhere Dn and Df are the near and far distances from\nbest focus, respectively, s is the lens focus distance, f\nis the lens focal length, c is the circle of confusion\nsize, and F is the lens F-number given by F \u00bc f =a,\nwhere a is the lens aperture [11]. The depth of field\ndecreases as the focus is reduced from infinity, the\nfocal length or lens aperture is increased, or the circle\nof confusion size is decreased. For WAMS, the image\nfocal distance is short (\u2265 36:8 in.) and a wide aperture\nis highly desirable for night vision applications, both\nof which reduce the depth of field. The depth of field\ncan be increased by reducing the focal length of the\nfocusing lens but this also reduces the image size on\nthe detector by increasing the circle of confusion size,\nbut this also reduces the image resolution, or by in-\ncreasing the lens F-number [7] but this also reduces\nthe light throughput. The only free parameter is the\nfocus distance, which should bemaximized by scaling\nup the mirror size as far as possible [7]. If the focus is\nset to 40.4 in. for \u03b8 \u00bc \u000175\u00b0, then the near and far\ndepths of field are both 0.061 in., which is obviously\ninsufficient to cover the image focal range of 36.8\u2013\n45.5 in. To accommodate the entire depth of field,\neither the F-number must be increased to\nF \u00bc 58:8, with \u223c4000\u00d7 light intensity loss compared\nto F \u00bc 1, or the circle of confusion must increase to\n\u223c1:5mm, with loss of image resolution. Ultimately,\nthe user must compromise and choose which part\nof the field of view to optimize the focus on.\nIn terms of focus, the primary\u2013secondary convex\u2013\nconical design presented is one of the best options\nbecause the camera to virtual image distance is\nmaximized, a major reason for choosing this design.\nHowever, for the concave\u2013concave design, a much\nnarrower depth of field requirement may be possible\nbecause the concave mirrors compress the virtual\nimage in front of the mirror surface. This remains\nto be investigated.\n3. Conclusion\nA wide angle mirror system (WAMS) has been de-\nsigned for distortion-free and blemish-free wide field\nof view imaging of the sky for a selected altitude. If\nthe user is willing to accept the cost of manufacture\nand modest loss of focus, especially for large viewing\nangles, then the WAMS offers significant advantages\nover traditional all-sky lenses. These include (1)\ndistortion-free achromatic imaging for a selected al-\ntitude, (2) uniform sky spatial resolution everywhere\non the detector, (3) a high light gathering capability\nmore than an order of magnitude greater than\ncommercially available all-sky lenses, and (4)\n10 September 2009 \/ Vol. 48, No. 26 \/ APPLIED OPTICS 5\nnarrowband interference filters that can be inserted\nwithout modification or additional optics.\nThis work was supported by the U.S. Air Force\nOffice of Scientific Research (AFOSR) task 2311AS.\nM.
