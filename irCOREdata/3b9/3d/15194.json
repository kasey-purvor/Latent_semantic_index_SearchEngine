The \ndietary aspects of this change have been investigated for many years using \ntraditional zooarchaeological and archaeobotanical methods, but in the last decade \nstable isotope analysis has become an additional major tool in these investigations. \nStable isotope results have been presented as strongly indicating a rapid shift from \n- 3 - \nwild to domesticated foodstuffs (Richards et al., 2003c) but this has been contested \nand the meaning of the isotope evidence in contrast to the zooarchaeological \nevidence has been hotly debated (Barberena and Borrero 2005; Hedges 2004; \nMilner et al. 2004, 2006; Richards and Schulting 2006). This debate has mostly been \nfocussed on Scandinavian, British, Breton and Portuguese sites. In this study we \ncontribute data on Middle Neolithic populations from Swifterbant (c. 4300-4000 BC) \nand Schipluiden (c. 3600-3400 BC) in the Lower Rhine Basin, in addition to the \ndietary isotope studies of the Late Mesolithic populations of Polderweg and De Bruin \n(Smits and Van der Plicht 2009). Here however we also aim to go beyond the simple \nuse of \u03b413C and \u03b415N measurements to examine diet and apply the isotopes of S, Sr, \nO and Pb to gain more insight into the diet, homogeneity of group composition, and \nfood procurement strategies of these populations. \nBackground \nThe Mesolithic-Neolithic transition is generally characterised by an overall change in \nlifestyle, especially in respect to subsistence, it witnesses a change from food \ngathering to food production largely coinciding with a change from living in temporary \ncamps to permanent settlements, including the use of pottery and implements \nassociated with a more agricultural economy. On the whole it is expected that this \nprocess is associated with a decline in the consumption of fish through time \nconcomitant with an increased intake of terrestrial food as has been observed for \nseveral regions of North-western Europe. Regional variation in the nature and pace \nof the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition is a topic raised time and again. Much discussion \nfocuses on the dichotomy in subsistence, i.e. the Mesolithic versus Neolithic diet, \nespecially on the fringes of the North-western Europe. Comparisons between sites \nand regions are beset by problems (not always recognised) such as dating, \ngeographical setting, climate, continuity of habitation, the quality and quantity of \narchaeological remains and excavation procedures as well as formation processes \nand the small sample sizes available for isotope research.  \nIsotope analysis has nevertheless increasingly been used to highlight aspects of diet \nand thus has become a crucial tool in the understanding of the transition. The carbon \nand nitrogen isotope composition of bone collagen primarily reflects the protein part \nof the diet, broadly distinguishing plant, animal, marine and freshwater food sources \n(see, for example, Hedges 2004 and the references therein). This method has \nproved its value and during the last ten years has been applied to a series of \npopulations from various regions and periods all over the world. Recent debate has \nfocused on the transition from forager to farmer in North-western Europe, with some \nfavouring a sharp and complete transition (among others Lubell et al. 1994; Richards \net al. 2003b, 2003c; Schulting 1998) but others opting for a more gradual and \nvariable change in lifestyle during a much longer time span (including Boric et al. \n2004; Lid\u00e9n et al. 2004; Milner et al. 2004). Here we briefly review these studies and \nstudies from elsewhere in Europe. In particular, studies of populations in the Iron \nGates Gorges region of the Danube provide a parallel to the Lower Rhine Basin in \nterms of the food resources available on a major river system.  \nIt is no wonder that different views exist on the manner in which the transition took \nplace. Clearly for Southern Scandinavia the geographical setting of the sites played \nan important role, from which it has been deduced that populations in coastal areas \nof Southern Sweden (c.8000-3000 BC) were less inclined to radically change their \nfood procurement strategies (Lid\u00e9n et al. 2004). This contrasts with Denmark where \na radical change occurs between the Mesolithic and Neolithic at about 4000 BC \n(Fischer et al. 2007; Richards et al. 2003b) and with sites in Latvia (Eriksson et al. \n2003) where fish remained an important dietary component from the Mesolithic into \n- 4 - \nthe early Neolithic, but were not detected in the Late Neolithic at the Zvejnieki \ncemetery (8th to 4th millennium BC). For Great Britain there is apparently a rapid \nchange at the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition (c. 4000 BC) for both coastal and inland \nsites (Hedges et al. 2008; Richards et al. 2003c), although sample sizes are small. In \nPortugal the same sharp shift in subsistence is attested between the Late Mesolithic \n(c.8100-7100 BC) and the Early Neolithic (c.6900-4500 BC) (Lubell et al. 1994). For \nBrittany the distinction is not as clear because dating problems obscure the overall \npicture (Schulting 1998; Schulting and Richards 2001). The Breton Mesolithic sites of \nHo\u00ebdic (c.3400-5800 BC) and T\u00e9viec (c.5600-4300 BC) are typified as having mainly \na marine\/aquatic subsistence, despite inter- and intra-site variation in isotope values, \nwhile further south and away from the coast at La Vergne (Charente-Maritime, \nFrance) the Mesolithic diet was strongly terrestrial (Schulting et al. 2008). Further \neast on the northern coast of Europe, the Late Mesolithic sites of Polderweg and De \nBruin revealed a mixed diet with terrestrial and aquatic components consistent with \nthe exploitation of various regions throughout the year (Smits and Van der Plicht \n2009). A picture distinct from the coastal areas of North-western Europe emerges \nfrom the Meuse valley where human remains from strictly continental sites were \ninvestigated in absence of comparable coastal sites (Bocherens et al. 2007). There \nthe Early Mesolithic diet (c.9300-8000 BC) was mixed, but mainly terrestrial, but in \nthe Middle Neolithic (c.4300-3000 BC) there is a slightly higher aquatic component in \nthe diet. The change in composition of the diet is attributed to changes in resource \navailability with landscape evolution, and dietary differences are attributed to the \ndifferent geographical settings of the sites. An alternative view of diet is provided by \ncharred surface residues on pottery, from which Craig et al. (2007) deduced that \nDanish coastal Mesolithic Erteb\u00f8lle populations (c.4600-3900 BC) utilised marine \nand freshwater resources, whilst inland Neolithic Funnel Beaker pottery (c.3900-2700 \nBC) had evidence for processing of freshwater fish. Pottery from the Late Mesolithic \nErteb\u00f8lle, and Neolithic Swifterbant and Michelsberg periods (c.5000-4000 BC) in the \nSchelde Valley of Belgium yielded evidence for freshwater fish processing. Further \nsouth, at the early Neolithic (after 5400 BC) site of Nieder-M\u00f6rlen in the Rhineland, \nisotope ratios are indicative of a purely terrestrial diet (Nehlich et al. 2009). Still \nfurther south, Durrwachter et al. (2006) found evidence for small amounts of \nfreshwater fish consumption at the Early Neolithic LBK (c.5000 BC) site of Herxheim \nin the middle Rhine Valley of Bavaria but not in a nearby Middle Neolithic site \n(c.4900-4600 BC) and similarly Bosl et al. (2006) found limited if any freshwater fish \nconsumption in the Late Neolithic of Bavaria (c.3500-3400 BC).  \nIn Eastern Europe there is also a variable picture. Several isotope investigations \nhave been undertaken of the populations of Lepenski Vir and Vlasac in the Iron \nGates Gorge region of the Danube (c. 9000-5500 BC) (Bonsall et al. 1997, 2000; \nBoric et al. 2004). The initial findings by Bonsall et al. (1997, 2000) describing a \nsharp Mesolithic-Neolithic dichotomy in diet have since been contradicted by Bori\u0107 et \nal. (2004), based on a renewed analysis of the faunal remains and a critical review of \nthe dating procedures. The new conclusions emphasise continuity in exploitation of \nfood resources during the transition phase, especially for the site of Lepenski Vir. \nAlthough some individuals from a slightly later phase show lower 15N values, \nsuggesting that diet became more mixed, there was no sharp chronological \ndistinction. In particular, the study of fish remains has contributed to a better \nunderstanding of the nitrogen isotope ratios. In earlier studies a large portion of these \nremains were not identified, but the new data indicate the presence of sturgeon in the \nfaunal remains. Considering the fact that these fish were very large in comparison to \nthe other species, Bori\u0107 et al. (2004) expected that they contributed considerably to \nthe diet. Bori\u0107 et al. (2004) explain the high 15N values not only by the consumption \nof sturgeon but also of the fish roe or caviar as they believe this latter is one trophic \nlevel higher than the mother, by analogy with trophic level differences between \n- 5 - \nsuckling mammals and their mothers. Although there is no direct evidence of the \nisotopic relationship of fish roe to its mother, a better analogy would be with tissues \nformed before birth in mammals, which suggests that roe would be isotopically \nindistinguishable from the mother (Balasse et al. 1997; Fogel et al. 1989; Millard \n2000). Nevertheless, Boric et al. (2004) are correct to deduce that these fish were \nprobably an easy catch as they swam upriver in springtime to spawn and often were \nclose to the surface of the water, and they also provided a large amount of fish meat \nand fat which must have made them attractive prey. Adult specimens can weigh as \nmuch as one hundred kilograms with the female sturgeon carrying 10-15% of her \nweight in caviar (Hol\u010dik 1989). \nFreshwater fish consumption is also evident from Mesolithic (c.7300-6200 BC) \nremains from sites in Dnieper Rapids region of the Ukraine, where the amount varies \nbut is always detectable, and fish consumption continues at lower levels into the \nEarly Neolithic (c.5500 BC), where it is interpreted as part of a broader resource \nexploitation strategy (Lillie and Jacobs 2006). On the Bulgarian coast of the Black \nSea analyses of the early- to mid-fifth millennium BC Neolithic and Copper Age \nburials from Varna and Durankulak show that a minority of individuals had a small \nmarine component to their diet and the majority had no detectable marine component \n(Honch et al. 2006). Similarly, in Greece Neolithic diets from both inland and coastal \nsites were found to be primarily terrestrial but with small amounts of marine resource \nutilisation detected at coastal sites (Papathanasiou 2003). In contrast there was no \nevidence for anything other than terrestrial resources being consumed at the \nNeolithic (4400 to 3300 BC) site of Ajdovska Jama in eastern Slovenia (Ogrinc and \nBudja 2005). \nQuestions have been raised on the discrepancies between, and the reliability of, the \nisotope analyses and the archaeological remains, as both sources of information \nhave flaws (Hedges 2004; Lid\u00e9n et al. 2004; Milner et al. 2004). The faunal remains \nare incomplete palimpsests spanning hundreds, or even thousands, of years that \ninhibit definite conclusions on the composition of the diet and the proportional division \nbetween the various food sources. On the other hand the stable isotope results \nrepresent the average diet of specific individuals, so that with the small numbers \nanalysed, and the possibility that we are dealing with a certain subset of the whole \npopulation, it may not be reliable to extrapolate the findings to Mesolithic and \nNeolithic populations in general. In addition to this, the interpretation of isotope \nresults is ambiguous due to (a) uncertainties in the trophic level offset between \ncollagen and food, (b) the difficulty of detecting small proportions of marine foods \n(Hedges 2004), (c) the averaging of food sources and the difficulties in estimating the \nproportions of more than three isotopically distinct foods (Phillips et al. 2005), (d) the \ninfluence of non-protein components of food on bone \u03b413C in a low protein diet \n(Hedges 2004), and (e) the possibility of manuring increasing cultivated plant 15N to \notherwise higher than expected values (Bogaard et al. 2007).  \nThe picture of dietary change in Europe at the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition is \ntherefore quite varied, with sharp changes of aquatic resource consumption occurring \nin a few areas, but more generally a gradual change in aquatic resource \nconsumption, which continues to decline throughout the Neolithic. \nThe present study \nIn this study the results of stable isotope analyses of two Middle Neolithic populations \nfrom the Lower Rhine Basin are presented. These show that in this relatively small \nregion the nature of the transition was not as straightforward and uniform as one \nmight expect and probably varied depending on factors like landscape, food \n- 6 - \nresources, social organisation and cultural identity. Like previous studies, we present \ninformation on subsistence by way of carbon ( 13C) and nitrogen ( 15N) analyses. \nFurther, we have incorporated analyses of the stable isotopes of strontium (87Sr\/86Sr), \noxygen ( 18O), sulphur ( 34S) and lead (206Pb\/204Pb, 207Pb\/204Pb, 208Pb\/204Pb) in this \nstudy, even though limited in scale, to gain insight in the use of the natural landscape \nand local food sources as well as the homogeneity terms of childhood residence of \nthe two populations. This additional data offers an enhanced understanding of the \nintra- and inter-site variability in diet.  \nAs described above, 13C, and 15N analyses allow the reconstruction of aspects of \nhuman diet within each group. 87Sr\/86Sr analyses of wild and domestic animal \nremains (tooth enamel) from archaeological contexts at both sites may allow \ncommentary on the geography of food procurement by providing additional \ninformation on the use of the landscape for both hunting and early pastoralism. \nCombined Pb-, Sr- and O-isotope analyses of human tooth enamel allows the \nidentification of immigrants amongst a population (Budd et al. 2004) and commentary \non their possible place of origin. \nAlthough the use of sulphur isotopes in archaeological studies is in its infancy, 34S \nanalysis offers an addition to the residential reconstruction by potentially \ndiscriminating between coastal and inland dwellers (Richards et al. 2001). Animals \nfrom marine food chains have 34S values of +16 to +20\u2030, whilst terrestrial animal \nand freshwater 34S ranges from \u201322 to +22\u2030 (Richards et al. 2003a), however in \nareas with significant freshwater input into a marine environment this can vary \ndepending on location (Craig et al. 2006). In plants and terrestrial animals 34S \nreflects that of local soils.  \nAlthough there is much less experience with the other isotopes compared to carbon \nand nitrogen analyses, we believe it is important to explore the possibilities for the \nreconstruction of the group composition and landscape use as a background for \nunderstanding different factors influencing the Neolithisation process.  \nMaterials and methods \nSwifterbant \nThe Swifterbant cluster of sites is located in the northeast of the Flevoland Polders of \nthe Netherlands (Figure 1), and is the type site for the Swifterbant culture (Van der \nWaals 1977, Louwe Kooijmans 2005). At the time of occupation the site was close to \ntidal waters, but some 10 km from the sea. Swifterbant can be seen as the earliest \nNeolithic of indigenous origin, about 1000 years later than the introduction of \nagriculture c. 5300 BC by the LBK culture in the Meuse basin. The indigenous \nMesolithic populations apparently retained a distinctive way of life for a long period, \nalthough there is ample evidence for contacts with the farming communities. \nExcavations have revealed traces of habitation pointing to a semi-permanent \nsettlement on several river dunes bordering a system of rivulets. Faunal and \ncarbonized botanical remains and the presence of pottery point to the introduction of \na Neolithic lifestyle (Van Zeist and Palfenier-Vegter 1981), including cereal cultivation \n(Cappers and Raemaekers 2008).  \nVarious clusters of graves were present, with the locations Swifterbant 2 and 3 (S2 \nand S3) particularly containing a number of graves (Constandse-Westermann and \nMeiklejohn 1979; Meiklejohn and Constandse-Westermann 1978). Despite poor \npreservation of the skeletal remains, a physical anthropological study provided \n- 7 - \ninsight into the demographic structure of the population indicating a group of c. 66 \nindividuals representing complete households.  \nThe dead were buried supine with hardly any grave goods, apart from limited \npersonal ornaments in some cases. In addition to the burials, recovery of isolated \nand scattered human bones on these sites as well as in the settlement area indicates \nthat burial was not the only mode of treatment of the dead. These traditions are \nreminiscent of the Late Mesolithic burial practices observed at the sites of \nHardinxveld-Giessendam, Polderweg and De Bruin (Louwe Kooijmans and Smits \n2001; Smits and Louwe Kooijmans 2001).  \nThe samples analysed derive from S2 and S3, which are both radiocarbon dated to \nbroadly the same period of 4300-4000 BC and located on river levees, with one \nsample from S21, c.6000BC. Tooth samples comprised six human teeth and one \ndeer tooth from S2, four human and five animal teeth from S3, and on human tooth \nfrom S21. Soil samples deriving from different contexts at S2 were also analysed \n(Tables 1-3). \nSchipluiden \nSchipluiden is a Middle Neolithic site dated to c. 3600\u20133400 BC (Louwe Kooijmans \nand Jongste 2006), located south of Delft (Figure 1). It was situated on a former \nbeach deposit, some three kilometres from the sea at the time of occupation. During \nthe course of occupation the intracoastal plain between the site and the sea was \ntransformed from a salt marsh to a freshwater reed-swamp.  \nThe settlement remains included many postholes, with at least one detectable house \nplan, a small burial ground, a fence at the perimeter of the dune and a refuse area. \nFaunal and botanical remains are indicative of a year-round permanent settlement \nsite. The strategic location allowed the exploitation of various eco-zones not only for \nhunting, fishing and gathering but also for husbandry and crop cultivation. Louwe \nKooijmans and Jongste (2006) define the subsistence system as an extended broad-\nspectrum economy.  \nIn total six graves revealed seven individuals because of the presence of one double \ngrave. The double grave contained the skeletons of two men, differing in burial \nposture from the other interments and possibly associated with an unnatural cause of \ndeath as attested by the physical anthropological study (Smits and Louwe Kooijmans \n2006). Isolated human bones were present in the burial area and in the refuse zone. \nIn total the human remains at this site represent 15 individuals, mostly men and \nchildren. The loose, scattered human remains are interpreted as the remnants of a \ntreatment of the dead that is mainly invisible archaeologically. \nBurial traditions differ from those at Swifterbant, in the fact that the dead were buried \nin a contracted, flexed position with folded (tied) limbs. Although variation was \ndetected in posture, for instance on the back, sideways or face down, the extremely \nflexed position of the arms and legs is the most remarkable feature. This is \ncomparable with the burials at Ypenburg, a contemporaneous site north of \nSchipluiden (Koot and Van der Have 2001; Koot et al. 2008). Grave goods were \nscarce and limited to some personal possessions. Exceptional is the presence of a \nstrike-a-light in grave 2 from which the skeleton of an elderly man was recovered.  \nFrom Schipluiden human teeth and bone samples from six individuals from five \ngraves were analysed together with three human teeth from other contexts. Soil \nsamples derived from four graves and a feature (no. 4018) yielding a human tooth. \n- 8 - \nSix animal teeth from a variety of contexts, including two from no. 4018 were also \navailable for analysis. All these samples are detailed in Table 1. \nSample preparation \nInitial sample preparation was conducted in the Department of Archaeology, Durham \nUniversity. Each tooth was sectioned using a flexible diamond impregnated cutting \ndisc, and enamel and dentine separated for independent chemical processing. \nWhere there was sufficient material, only half of the tooth was used. \nThe crown and cut surfaces of the enamel were abraded from the surface to a depth \nof ~100 m using a tungsten carbide dental burr and the removed material \ndiscarded. Any adhering dentine was then removed using the burr and the resulting \nclean core enamel isolated for oxygen, strontium and lead isotope analysis.  \nSoil samples were leached overnight in 10 % v\/v acetic acid (Romil UpA) to extract \ntotal exchangeable cations representative of labile, and therefore ancient \nbioavailable, Sr. Leachates were evaporated to dryness and then treated in the same \nway as cleaned enamel samples. \nO-isotope analysis \nAnalyses were conducted at the NERC Isotope Geoscience Laboratory, Keyworth, \nUK. Sub-samples of 15-30 mg of enamel were cleaned using H2O2. Biological \nphosphate dissolution and re-precipitation as Ag3PO4 was carried out using standard \nmethods (Chenery 2005; O'Neil et al. 1994). Measurement of Ag3PO4 \u03b4\n18O was \ncarried out by Continuous Flow Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry (CFIRMS). The \ninstrumentation comprised a TC\/EA (high temperature elemental analyser) coupled \nto a Delta Plus XL isotope ratio mass spectrometer via a ConFlo III interface (Thermo \nFinnigan). Mean reproducibility on batch controls was 0.09 \u2030, and for the NBS120C \nphosphate standard was 0.17 \u2030 (1\u03c3, n=15). All samples were analysed in triplicate.  \nSr- and Pb-isotope analysis \nChemical purification and analysis were performed in the Northern Centre for Isotopic \nand Elemental Tracing, Department of Earth Sciences, Durham University. Tooth \nenamel samples of ~20-175 mg were cleaned in deionised water and dissolved in 16 \nM HNO3 (Romil UpA) for analysis. Sr and Pb were extracted as separate fractions \neluted from a column of Sr-Spec (a crown-ether based exchange chromatography \nmedium, Eichrom). Procedural Sr blanks were 0.15\u20130.57 ng. To ensure sufficient \nlead was present for measurement, lead extracts were screened for concentration \nusing ICPMS. Procedural blanks for Pb extraction were 0.34\u20130.91 ng, and analysed \nsamples contained 10\u201356 ng Pb. 87Sr\/86Sr ratios and the Pb isotope ratios were \nmeasured using a ThermoFinnigan Multi-collector ICP Mass Spectrometer (MC-ICP-\nMS) . For Sr, reproducibility of the standard NBS987 during analysis was 0.710258 \u00b1 \n21 ppm (2\u03c3, n=14). The NBS 981 standard was used for lead isotopes, the \nreproducibility is given in Table 2. \nC-, N- and S-isotope analysis \nSamples of dentine between 150 and 500 mg were taken (depending on availability), \nand processed following a modified Longin method. Samples were demineralised in \n0.5 M HCl for several days in a fridge, with a change of acid every day. The resulting \ninsoluble collagen was solubilised by gelatinisation at pH 4 and 75 C over night, and \nlyophilised. Iso-Analytical Limited conducted isotopic measurements of prepared \n- 9 - \nsamples. All measurements were made in duplicate where there was sufficient \nmaterial. \nFor C and N isotope analysis, freeze-dried gelatin was weighed into tin capsules, \nsealed, and then loaded into an automatic sampler on a sample preparation module. \nCarbon and nitrogen contents were measured using a Europa Scientific Roboprep, \nand the samples automatically passed to a Europa Scientific 20-20 IRMS. The \nreference material used during analysis of the samples was NBS-1577a, Bovine \nLiver, with certified isotopic values of 13C = -21.68 \u2030 and 15N = 7.25 \u2030. Values \nmeasured during the analysis were 13C = -21.65 \u00b1 0.13 \u2030 and 15N = 7.28 \u00b1 0.2 \u2030 \n(1\u03c3, n=5). \nFor sulphur isotope analysis, samples were weighed into tin capsules, and vanadium \npentoxide catalyst added. The tin capsules were sealed, and loaded into an \nautomatic sampler, combusted and isotope measurements made by IRMS. The \nreference materials used during analysis of the samples were IA-R036 (Iso-Analytical \nworking standard barium sulphate, with 34S=20.74 \u2030) and NBS-1577A (which does \nnot have a certified value, but for which Iso-Analytical report a long-term average of \n7.86 \u2030). The values measured during the analysis were 20.92 \u00b1 0.40 \u2030 (1\u03c3, n=4) for \nIA-R036 and 8.27 \u00b1 0.49 \u2030 (1\u03c3, n=4) for NBS-1577A. \nResults \nIsotope results for human teeth are tabulated in Tables 1 and 2, and strontium \nisotope values for animal teeth and soils in Table 3. Samples SCH6 and SWH4 failed \nto yield sufficient collagen for analysis, and yields from SWH2 and SWH3 were too \nlow to permit 34S analysis. Several other samples yielded collagen sufficient for only \none measurement on 34S (SWH1, SWH7, SWH8, SWH9). \nCarbon and nitrogen isotopes \nQuality control on extracted collagen is given by examination of the C\/N ratio, which \nshould normally lie in the range 2.9 to 3.6 (DeNiro 1985). Four samples fall outside \nthis range, and must therefore be considered less reliable. \nA plot of 13C versus 15N is shown in Figure 2. Samples SWH3 and SWH8 come \nfrom deciduous molars whose dentine is forming during the last few months in utero \nand during the first year of life. They are therefore forming during the period of \nbreastfeeding and may show elevated 15N and slightly elevated 13C compared to \nothers in the population as a result (Fogel et al. 1989). This certainly seems to be the \ncase for SWH3, which has an elevated 15N compared to the other Swifterbant \nsamples. Typical 13C values for consumers of terrestrial foods are \u201321 to \u201320 \u2030, but \nthe Swifterbant population shows slightly lower values and relatively high 15N, \nsuggesting a possible input of protein from freshwater fish in the diet. In contrast, the \nSchipluiden people have higher 13C values with a greater range, and 15N that is \neven more elevated. SCH2, SCH7 and SCH8 appear to have diets of similar isotopic \ncomposition to the Swifterbant people, but the others from Schipluiden have higher \n15N and 13C indicating a significant marine protein input to their diet. SCH1, with \n13C of \u201316.5 \u2030 may have obtained as much as 50 % of his or her protein from \nmarine sources. The highest nitrogen value was measured in SCH9, a child of about \ntwo years old, and is therefore probably influenced by breastfeeding that elevated the \n15N by up to 3 \u2030 (Fogel et al. 1989). The pattern of results from the teeth are \nrepeated in carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses of bone from six Schipluiden \nindividuals at the Groningen radiocarbon laboratory (Table 1, Figure 2), with four of \n- 10 - \nthem corresponding to individuals analysed in this project. They show a slight offset \nin both carbon and nitrogen isotopes, perhaps indicating a shift in diet between \nchildhood and adulthood. The one exception is SCH8 who shows a more terrestrial \nsignal, with a lower nitrogen isotope ratio. Altogether, these isotope results are \nentirely consistent with faunal evidence for the exploitation of domestic animals, wild \nanimals, aquatic birds, marine and freshwater fish, and a few marine mammals. \nHowever, they suggest more emphasis on the marine component of diet than would \nbe deduced from meat weights derived from the faunal remains, which is not \nsurprising as fish bones are often underrepresented in excavated samples. They also \nsuggest a significant amount of variability between individuals. \nSulphur isotopes \nCriteria for the reliability of 34S measurements from collagen have only been \nestablished since we conducted our study. The C\/S ratio of fresh collagen is \nexpected to be about 780 according to Richards et al. (2001) but our calculations \nfrom the amino-acid composition of collagen suggest a value of about 500, as do \nCraig et al. (2006). All our samples yield values much lower than this, suggesting that \nsulphur has been added to the samples during diagenesis. Our C\/S values are at the \nlower end of the range reported by Richards et al. (2001) and outside the 300-900 \nrange for well preserved collagen established by Nehlich and Richards (2009), so the \n34S results must be interpreted very cautiously. However, the two sites are clearly \ndistinguished in their 34S values (Figure 3). At Schipluiden the values are lower than \nat Swifterbant, despite the 13C evidence of a higher marine component to the diet in \nthe Schipluiden population. The relative importance of different dietary sources in \ncontributing to the 13C and 34S signals in collagen is unknown, as are the local 34S \nvalues for the two sites, though being coastal one would expect values close to \nmarine values. Sulphur isotopes alone do not identify any migrants, though SCH1 \nand SCH2 appear to differ from the other four Schipluiden individuals. \nStrontium isotopes \nThe remarkable thing about the Swifterbant Sr isotope values is the homogeneity of \nall but SWH10 (Figure 4). They show a smaller range of enamel isotope values than \nany other site we are aware of. Homogeneity of the Sr isotope ratios in bone samples \nis commonly caused by diagenesis. However, all samples show higher 87Sr\/86Sr \nratios than the soils, suggesting that diagenesis is not be the cause. They are also \ndistinct from, though close to, the seawater ratio of 0.70918. Whilst diagenesis is a \npossible explanation, it seems more likely that these values represent a \u201ccatchment\u201d \nfor diet at Swifterbant that is isotopically very homogeneous. The outlier, SWH10, \nmust have migrated to the site after childhood and have come from an area with an \nunderlying geology having more radiogenic strontium. It is interesting to note that the \n15N for this individual is significantly lower than for all the others, but the collagen \nquality was not within acceptable limits. If the 15N is reliable then in childhood this \nperson was partaking of different foods than the others, possibly eating less fish or \nless meat.  \nThree of the deer from Swifterbant show higher Sr isotope ratios than the humans, \nwhilst the dog, beaver and one deer are indistinguishable from the majority of \nhumans. The animals primarily come from site S3, whilst the humans were buried at \nsite S2. It appears that the isotopic sources contributing to human diet at one site and \nto animal diet at the other were different. This may represent changing procurement \nstrategies, or different catchments. The two sites are less than one kilometre apart, \n- 11 - \nbut separated by a large river channel, which could cause their catchments to be \ngeographically distinct. \nAt Schipluiden the humans show similar values to the majority at Swifterbant, but \nwith slightly more variation. The animals show a similar range to the humans. The \ndifferences between the humans and soil samples from their grave fills imply that \ndiagenesis is not a problem. The range of values from the soils indicates that neither \nhumans nor animals were exploiting all these soil substrates for food resources. \nThere are no clearly identified migrants there, and, given the similarity of values from \nSwifterbant, it may be that the Pleistocene and Holocene sediments of the Dutch \ncoast are homogeneous in Sr isotopes and thus it may be impossible to identify \nmigrants from anywhere along the 100 km of coast between the two sites. \nOxygen isotopes  \nThe oxygen isotope results from both sites (Figure 4) show a wider range of values \nthan the approximately 1 \u2030 that would be expected from humans drinking a single \nsource of water (Longinelli 1984). The range at Schipluiden is particularly large \n(3.1 \u2030), but that at Swifterbant is less remarkable (1.5 \u2030). \nAnalysis of \u03b418O of precipitation from nearby stations of the ISOHIS database \n(IAEA\/WMO, 2004) suggests that both sites have modern precipitation with an \nannual mean within the range \u20136.9 to \u20137.0 \u2030. Calibration to human tooth enamel \nvalues using the equation of Daux et al. (2008) and allowing for the variability of \nhuman populations on a single drinking water source, suggests that local human \ntooth enamel values derived from this water should have enamel 18O in the range \napproximately 16.9-17.9 \u2030. \nIn evaluating the results from Swifterbant it is necessary to consider the possibility of \nclimatic change over the long period of occupation of the site. During the occupation \nof S21, c.6000 BC, the temperature in North-west Europe was slightly warmer than in \nthe recent past, and the time of S2 and S3 at about 4000 BC saw a cooling. This is \nreflected (with other factors) in the changing 18O of stalagmite B7-7 from Cave B7 in \nthe Sauerland (Niggemann et al. 2003), which is slightly lower in the later period. \nAlthough in Europe precipitation 18O changes at 0.25 \u2030 per C (Darling 2004) the \ncoastal location of these sites may be subject to stronger effects and other causes of \nchange. In particular, the current distribution of 18O of precipitation shows a \u201etongue\u201f \nof high values extending from the Atlantic along the English Channel, but not \naffecting the North Sea. It is quite conceivable that this marine effect could be \nextended eastwards along the Dutch coast under conditions of slightly warmer \nclimate or with slightly changed weather patterns, leading to an increase of 18O in \nprecipitation that is larger than would otherwise be predicted.  \nThus the 18O values in the range 17.1 to 17.7 \u2030 at S2 and S3 are all plausible local \nvalues. The other two apparently high values of 18.1 and 18.4 \u2030 for SWH3 and \nSWH8 respectively come from deciduous molars which may include a signal from the \nsuckling effect which can raise 18O by anything up to 2 \u2030 (White et al. 2004). \nOxygen isotopes therefore provide no positive evidence for immigrants at \nSwifterbant. \nAt Schipluiden, with its much shorter occupation in a period of climate not dissimilar \nto today, it is easier to interpret the 18O results. As at Swifterbant, the \u201elocal\u201f tooth \nenamel signal is expected to be approximately 16.8-17.8 \u2030 and the majority of \nindividuals fall in or close to this range at 16.6-17.4 \u2030. SCH5 at 16.4 \u2030 is a possible \n- 12 - \nmigrant, but it is possible that analytical uncertainty (0.17 \u2030) or a small shift in 18O \nof precipitation could account for the difference. On the other hand, SCH6 at 15.8 \u2030 \nand SCH7 at 18.9 \u2030 cannot conceivably be local. Using the calibration of Daux et al. \n(2008) shows that SCH6 must have spent his childhood somewhere well to the east \nor south with a drinking water 18O of -9.4 \u00b1 0.5 \u2030, which is consistent with modern \nprecipitation in a broad band from central Scandinavia, though eastern and southern \nGermany to the western Alps. Conversely SCH7 came from the west with a \nchildhood drinking water of \u20134.6 \u00b1 0.5 \u2030, corresponding to the western fringes of \nBritain, the west coast of France, or Spain. Whilst the other individuals have values \ncompatible with a local origin, it is also quite possible that they have migrated shorter \ndistances. \nLead isotopes \nDue to low lead levels and small sample sizes, after screening for sufficient Pb, only \n7 of the 18 human tooth samples were found suitable for Pb isotope measurements. \nEven so the procedural blank for Pb was relatively high compared to the yields from \nthe samples, and we cannot be entirely certain that the results are not biased by \nblank contamination. This illustrates the need for consistent low-lead blanks when \nanalysing prehistoric humans.  \nFigure 5 shows 207Pb\/206Pb data plotted against 87Sr\/86Sr. For comparison of humans \nto local environmental values, soil values are plotted by combining our Sr isotope \nmeasurements with soil Pb isotope data for top- and sub-soils from four sites close to \nthe archaeological sites (Walraven et al. in prep.), given in Table 2. Urk is located in \nFlevoland, 17 kilometres north across the River IJssel from Swifterbant. There is an \nanalysis from Schipluiden itself and from the site of Rijswijk some 12 km further \nnorth. Giessendam is some 64 km east of Schipluiden. Both top-soil and sub-soil Pb \nare likely to be contaminated with lead from vehicle exhausts, but the sub-soil should \nbe less contaminated, and these values are plotted.  \nThree of the four Swifterbant human analyses cluster close together, but SWH10 \nappears to be an outlier, falling the other side of the one local soil measurement, and \nmuch further away. At Schipluiden two of the individuals have lead isotope values \nconsistent with local soils, but again there is one, SCH7, with a higher value. Clearly \nthere is a need for further analyses of local geological formations to investigate \nenvironmental lead isotope variation more fully, but currently SWH10 and SCH7 are \npossible migrants on the basis of the Pb isotope data. However, we stress that this \ninterpretation must be regarded as tentative given the possibility of a blank \ncontribution to the measured ratio, and the lack of lead isotope measurements on \nsoils from Swifterbant itself. \nDiscussion  \nDiet \nSwifterbant and Schipluiden are both clearly Neolithic not only in date but also in \nview of the archaeological indicators for living in (semi-)permanent settlements, the \ntoolkit and the knowledge of agriculture. The carbon and nitrogen isotope values for \nthe Swifterbant people are in accordance with the general trend discussed above, \nhaving a diet which was mostly terrestrial but with a definite aquatic component, \nthough this contrasts with the nearest northern European areas (British Isles, \nDenmark, Meuse Valley) where there is little or no aquatic component detectable \nfrom isotopes in human bones. Elsewhere, where there is sufficient data, there is \nevidence for declining use of aquatic resources through the Neolithic, but although \n- 13 - \nSwifterbant is 500 years earlier than Schipluiden the values from Schipluiden reveal \na strong aquatic dependence in subsistence which compares with Mesolithic values \nelsewhere, and is even stronger than at the relatively close Late Mesolithic sites from \nthe Dutch river area, Polderweg and De Bruin (Smits and Van der Plicht 2009). The \nnitrogen values are especially indicative of a high trophic level associated with the \nmarine food chain. Thus Schipluiden does not comply with the general picture, even \nthough agriculture had been practised in the loess zone of the Lower Rhine Basin for \n1500 years. \nThe unusual isotope values for Schipluiden are paralleled by those from Lepenski Vir \nand Vlasac in the Danube Gorges (Bonsall et al. 1997, 2000; Boric et al. 2004) \n(Figure 6), and this parallel is strengthened by the well-attested presence of sturgeon \nin both faunal spectra (Brinckhuizen 2006). The practical absence of sturgeon \nremains at Swifterbant and the lower nitrogen isotope ratios accord with this (Zeiler \n1997), although specific taphonomic processes may be responsible for the invisibility \nof sturgeon remains in the faunal spectrum of Swifterbant. \nThe type of sturgeon present in the Dutch rivers was the Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser \nsturio). This anadromous fish migrated from the sea to the rivers around the end of \nApril to spawn on the riverbeds in June and July. The fish could have been \nprocessed or dried for winter supplies and the caviar may not only have been \nconsumed by itself but conceivably served for the salting and flavouring or even the \npreserving of other foodstuffs. In this respect the isotope analysis of food crusts in \npottery may provide useful information.  \nApart from sturgeon, Bori\u0107 et al. (2004) take the consumption of dogs that were fed \non fish remains into account, a feature that might have contributed to the high \nnitrogen isotope ratios as well. At Schipluiden the skeletal remains of a number of \ndogs were present, including three deliberately killed by a blow to the head, but it is \nunclear whether dogs were eaten there (Zeiler 2006). One observation resulting from \nthe similarity between the Lepenski Vir and Schipluiden is inescapable and that is the \nimportance of the local habitat and the presence of probably highly favoured food \nsources that could have served as an important factor in inhibiting radical changes in \nsubsistence. This feature also helps explain the differences between Swifterbant and \nSchipluiden in a relatively small area like the Lower Rhine Basin. \nGroup composition \nThe isotope analysis has revealed several immigrants, some of them with a diet \nlower in fish consumption than the locals. For Swifterbant the oxygen, sulphur, \nstrontium and lead isotopes are consistent with a local origin for all individuals except \nSWH10, whose nitrogen isotope value is also suggestive of a diet lower in fish than \nfor the others. The \u03b418O values at Schipluiden show that the immigrants may well \nhave travelled hundreds of kilometres. \nAt Schipluiden the strontium, oxygen and lead isotopes combined identify SCH6 and \nSCH7 as immigrants, with the possibility that SCH5 was also an immigrant. Carbon \nand nitrogen isotope results suggest that SCH2, SCH7 and SCH8 had less marine \nfoods in their diet than the others.  \nIt is notable that three of the identified immigrants (SWH10, SCH6 and SCH7) are \nrepresented only by isolated molars, and two of these individuals had a diet lower in \nfish than others at these sites. The sample size is very small, but, as these \nindividuals were not of local origin, this does raise the possibility that differences in \nboth diet and attitude towards burial were associated with cultural identity. An \n- 14 - \nassociation between burial characteristics and migration was also found at the \nRhineland early Neolithic site of Nieder-M\u00f6rlen (Nehlich et al 2009) An additional \nfactor might be social status, for example SCH5 was set apart by an exceptional \ngrave gift \u2013 a strike-a-light \u2013 perhaps indicating a special position in society. Our \ncombined isotope approach thus allows us to start to identify factors like immigration \nand social status as part of the reasons for intra-site variability in diet and treatment \nof the dead. \nLandscape use \/ food procurement strategies  \nAlthough only a small number of animal and soil samples were analyzed some \nindications for landscape use are revealed. At Swifterbant animal strontium isotopes \nsuggest that sites S2 and S3 may have had isotopically and therefore geographically \nseparate catchments. However, from archaeological point of view this is unlikely for \ntwo contemporaneous sites as they are very close together, and mobility over water \nwould not have been a problem. The different catchments may, therefore, arise from \na slight chronological difference. At Schipluiden the range of soil strontium values \nindicates that humans and the animals they exploited were not using all the areas of \nlandscape represented by our soil samples. This is compatible with the idea that still \na significant part of the food was derived from the surrounding aquatic part of the \nlandscape.  \nSo the location of the sites and the natural surroundings show a variety of \ncatchments for both sites, which sheds light on the use of the landscape. This \ncoincides with the idea of a mixed diet in Swifterbant and the suspected semi- \npermanent settlement there. For Schipluiden the heterogeneous isotope results \ncomply with the notion of an extended broad-spectrum economy, which is in \naccordance with, but also an addition to, the archaeological findings.  \nConclusions \nThe population from Swifterbant had a remarkably uniform set of isotope results. \nCarbon and nitrogen isotopes suggest terrestrial and freshwater fish dependence. All \nindividuals grew up locally except for SWH 10. Different catchments are suggested \nby the animal strontium values. At Schipluiden there is more variation. The combined \nisotope results identify not only immigrants but also reveal that some of them had a \ndiet lower in fish than the local people. The lack of a formal burial ritual shows that \nthese people were treated after death according to a tradition resulting in an above \nground distribution of disarticulated bones. The isotope results corroborate the \nsuggestion of Louwe Kooijmans and Jongste (2006) that various food resources \nwere exploited throughout the year indicating an extended broad-spectrum economy. \nWhilst it is dangerous to extrapolate from just two sites, even within the Middle \nNeolithic there is a clear variability in the isotope results, with the earlier Swifterbant \nshowing very little evidence for migration, and a mostly terrestrial diet, whilst 500 \nyears later Schipluiden has a higher proportion of migrants and strong evidence for \nthe exploitation of marine resources.  \nThis study has shown that apart from the reconstruction of the protein part of the diet \nby way of carbon and nitrogen analysis a more general background can be sketched \nincluding the use of the landscape and the provenance of the population by applying \nadditional stable isotope research. Together with the archaeological data like the \nfaunal remains and the burial ritual a better understanding of the intra- and inter-site \nvariability in diet can be achieved. The results have provided the insight that even in \na small area like the Lower Rhine Basin the nature and expansion of the Neolithic \n- 15 - \nlifestyle is very heterogeneous and even supply us with possible reasons why people \nresponded as they did to new challenges, whether they adopted new habits or not \nand why they held on to their own traditional routines a while longer. \nAcknowledgements \nWe thank Susan Hughes for originally bringing the authors together.
