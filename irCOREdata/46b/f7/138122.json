INTRODUCTION \nCustomers are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their demand for differentiated and \nbetter quality products [1]  and, at the same time, the complexity of products and technologies \nare increasing and their functionalities expanding [2]. Given this environment, it is unusual for \na single company to perform all activities from product design, production of components, and \nfinal assembly to delivery to the final user [3]. More often success depends on collaborating \nwith other companies that have complementary competencies [4].  Hence individual \ncompanies no longer compete alone but rather as supply chains [5].  Here, it is crucial for a \nmanufacturing company to reliably position itself in the supply chain in order to create the best \npossible competitive advantage.  This strategic positioning decision is concerned with deciding \nthose manufacturing activities that a company should carry out internally and those that should \nremain external [6]. It is associated with the firm\u2019s internal span of process, the degree and \ndirection of vertical integration alternatives and its links and relationships with suppliers, \ndistributors and customers [7]. \n \nThe SMEs in Singapore face particular challenges from increasing competition from \nmanufacturing in China, India and other East Asian countries. For these SMEs, their key \nchallenges depend critically on defining their own competitive space [6] among other \ncompanies in the manufacturing supply chain, so as to maximize business competitiveness. \nCurrently this decision has been formed in a rather fragmented manner, thus leading to sub-\noptimum overall performance. As a result, there is an urgent need to investigate existing \nmethodologies and evaluate them in the context of Singapore SMEs.   The research described \n5  \nin this project has therefore set out to explore current processes and evaluate a leading method \nto see how it could be improved for use by SMEs in Singapore.  \n \nThe research strategy has followed three distinct phases. First, to review the literature to \nidentify existing methodologies related to strategic supply chain positioning for the purpose of \nselecting the most suitable. The second phase of the research then was to evaluate the \nmethodology by applying and testing in two real case studies. The final phase of the research \nwas to analyse the case study results and establish how the process can be further adapted for \nSMEs in Singapore.  \n \nThis paper is structured to first provide a background to this topic, along with the concept of \nstrategic supply chain positioning and an overview of previous research. The research aim and \nprogramme are then presented, and then the case studies, results and analysis are presented in \nturn. \n \n2. BACKGROUND AND PREVIOUS RESEARCH  \nThis section describes the background of the research starting with the industrial problem, the \nconcept of strategic supply chain positioning is then described, and lastly followed by a review \nof previous research work on the strategic positioning decision making process. \n \n2.1 Industrial Problem \nCurrently, there are about 100,000 SMEs in Singapore, both in the manufacturing and service \nsectors, and they are defined as companies with at least 30% local ownership, with Fixed \n6  \nAssets Investment (FAI) of less than $12m, and an employment size of less than 100. These \nlocal SMEs are an important part of the Singapore economy comprising 92% of total \nestablishments, employ 51% of the workforce, and generate 34% of the total value added. \nSMEs in Singapore are however not as dynamic as their foreign counterparts in other Asian \ncountries such as Hong Kong or Taiwan, and they lag behind in productivity, management \nskills, marketing and technology [8].  With the opening of manufacturing and markets in \nChina, India and other East Asian countries, the global economic landscape is rapidly \nchanging.  The SMEs are facing growing competitive pressures from low cost manufacturing \nlocations in these countries whilst lagging behind developed nations in sophisticated high-tech \nmanufacturing.   \nWith both increasing competitive pressures from the low cost manufacturing countries on the \none hand, and the high-tech manufacturing countries on the other, the challenge for SMEs in \nSingapore includes finding their most favourable strategic position in the global supply chain \nnetwork. This is an important and urgent challenge for Singapore's future economic \ndevelopment as SMEs are a key component of the strategy to develop Singapore into a major \nnode in global business and a total business centre [9]. Increasingly, these challenges cannot be \neffectively met by isolated change to specific organisational units of the SME, but instead \ndepend critically on the dynamic relationships and interdependencies among different \ncompanies in the whole manufacturing supply chain in which they participate. Although this is \na very important decision for a SME company to make, there are currently few formalized \nmethodologies that managers can use as a guide, and as a result, this decision has been formed \nin a rather fragmented manner, thus leading to sub-optimum overall performance. A \ncoordinated and holistic approach towards the decision making process is needed. \n7  \n \n2.2 The Concept of Strategic Supply Chain Positioning \nThe concept of strategic positioning looks beyond traditional concepts, such as Make-versus-\nBuy and Outsourcing, by considering the interactions between manufacturing operations and \nthe wider supply chain networks associated with the organisation. Baines et al. [6] define \n\u2018strategic positioning\u2019 as concerned with the process of choosing those production centred \nactivities that an organisation should carry out internally, and those that should be external and \nunder the ownership and control of suppliers, partners, distributors and even customers.  \nSimilarly they define \u2018position\u2019 as a statement of where a company sits within its supply chain \nnetworks and introduce a new concept of \u2018competitive space\u2019 to refer to this position. Baines et \nal see that the Competitive Space of a firm has four sets of interaction, namely; the upstream \nboundary with suppliers, the downstream boundary with customers, the infrastructure \nboundary, and the product range boundary. At each of these interfaces a company has choices, \nthe outcomes of which will modify the strategic position.  \n \nThere are other researchers who defined strategic positioning in supply chains and these \ninclude Hill [7], Valliespir and Kleinhans [10], and Johansen and Riis [11]. Hill [7], who is \namongst the first group of researchers who defined strategic positioning, defined \u2018position\u2019 as a \nkey strategic decision for manufacturers and is associated with the firm\u2019s internal span of \nprocess, the degree and direction of vertical integration alternatives and its links and \nrelationships with suppliers, distributors and customers. Valliespir and Kleinhans [10] also \ndefined the concept of strategic positioning of a company, positioned between its suppliers and \ncustomers on its supply chain, as modifying its activity on the chain and deciding upon the \n8  \ndirection of the vertical integration (upstream or downstream) and limits of the extension. \nJohansen and Riis [11] developed a framework of three archetypal production firms and their \nproduction roles, each associated with its own unique position in the supply chain.  \n \n2.3 Strategic Positioning Decision Making Processes \nThis section reviews previous work that has contributed to the strategic positioning decision \nmaking process.  This is achieved by first looking at research that takes a holistic view of all \nthe four interfaces with the supply chain, as identified by Baines et al [6], and then also \nconsidering work that has looked at interfaces individually. \n \nVallespir and Kleinhans [10] developed a fuzzy logic model to support the decision-making \nprocess of a company, positioned in a supply chain, to decide and modify the scope of its \nactivity on the chain. Johansen and Riis [11] explained the characteristics of the future \nindustrial company and gave a framework for the strategic positioning for the future. Baines et \nal. [6] proposed an integrated strategic positioning decision process for guiding manufacturers \nto decide upon the strategic position of their manufacturing organisation. Here they provided a \nrange of tools and techniques for forming this decision. \n \nResearch on supplier interface covers a wide range of relationship types possible with \nsuppliers to the in-bound material supply chain. This is addressed directly under the umbrella \nof make-versus-buy, strategic sourcing and suppliers selection. Authors who have proposed \nframeworks and models in make-or-buy decisions include Jauch and Wilson [12], Buchowicz \n[13], Welch and Nayak [14], Bruck [15], Probert [16], McIvor et al. [17], Padillo and Diaby \n9  \n[18], Humpreys et al. [19], Humphreys et al. [20], and Platts [21].  Probert [16] reported that \nthe make-or-buy issue is of major concern within manufacturing businesses, being directly \nlinked to the basis on which a firm chooses to compete. Probert described the development and \nuse of a systematic approach to formulating a make or buy strategy. Research on strategic \nsourcing covered by writers includes Greaver [22], Quinn and Hilmer [23], Lonsdale and Cox \n[24], Tayles and Drury [25], Jennings [26], Barragan et al. [27], Freytag and Kirk [28], Jin \n[29], and Talluri and Narasimhan [30]; partnerships and relationships by Lamming [31] and \nMacbeth and Ferguson [32]; global sourcing by Narasimhan and Carter [33], Cavusgil et al. \n[34], Fraering and Prasad [35], Nellore et. al [36], Kotabe and Murray [37]; manufacturing \nsourcing practices by Narashimhan and Das [38], and Baines and Kay [39]. Various \nresearchers proposed the supplier selection methods in several ways including Nydick and \nRonald [40], Weber and Ellram [41], Chao et al. [42], Masella and Rangone [43], Sarkis and \nTalluri [44], Barla [45], Dulmin and Mininno [46], and Humphreys et al. [47].  \n \nThe customer interface is covered in marketing literature by such authors as Jones and Clark \n[48], Christopher [49 & 50]. Another aspect of customer interface is physical distribution \nmanagement channels and authors concerned include Stevens [51], Ballou [52], and Jeffries \n[53]; comprehensive review of major physical distribution channels by Bowersox [54] and \nGattorna [55]; distribution for international market by Stock and Lambert [56]; cooperation in \ndistribution channels by Gill and Allerheiligen [57]. The infrastructure interface deals with the \ncapabilities, services and facilities associated with manufacture; and may for example include \nmachinery, IT and people.  The support\/technology supply decision area within manufacturing \ncompanies has been investigated by such researchers as Baines et al [58] writing on technology \n10  \nsourcing and generally within business by work on facilities management such as Henderson \n[59].  Chiesa and Manzini [60] have developed their work based upon what they see as the \ntraditional technology management model of Hax and No [61].  Some of the processes have an \nalternative emphasis. For example, Frohlich [62] examines the levels of acceptance that \nadvanced manufacturing technology faces as it passes through the various phases of \nimplementation. Durrani et al. [63] developed a model which provides a formalised approach \nto technology acquisition. Li et al. [64] developed a stochastic programming model to aid \nmanufacturing firms in making strategic decisions in technology acquisition.  Baines [65] \nexplored a wide variety of US companies to understand manufacturing technology sourcing \npolicies. Tracey et al. [66] investigated the formulation of strategic plans that are consistent \nwith investment in and use of manufacturing technology. Moller et al. [67] developed a \nframework to guide companies in developing and handling competence-based relationships \nwith technology suppliers. Other authors who have focused their attention on the management \nof the technology boundary include Swamidass [68], Gerwin and Kolodny [69], Goodman and \nLawless [70], Gregory et al [71], Anderson et al [72], Twiss and Goodridge [73] and Farrukh \net al [74]. \n \nIn summary, much of the existing research work only addresses part of the supply chain and \ndeals with the boundary interface to suppliers, customers, infrastructure and product range \nindependently. There are few research works on strategic supply chain positioning taking a \nholistic view of all the four interfaces. Furthermore, the current methodology is developed \nfrom the perspective of larger multinational companies (MNCs) and specifically for the \nmanufacturing industry. SMEs in Singapore comprise not only the manufacturing industry but \n11  \nalso other industry sectors, such as the logistics industry, and they are very different in \ncompany size with more typical levels of comparative advantage. The challenge therefore \nremains to explore current processes, select a suitable leading strategic positioning decision \nprocess, evaluate the process in depth with SMEs in Singapore, and identify future research \nneeded. This has then led naturally to the research described in the remainder of this paper. \n3. RESEARCH AIM AND PROGRAMME \n \nThe aim of the research is therefore to evaluate a leading strategic positioning decision process \nfor application to SMEs in Singapore, and from this to establish what modifications are needed \nto this process. In order to realise the research aim for this research project, the following \nresearch objectives have been defined: \n \n1. Review the literature to identify the potentially most suited strategic positioning \nmethodology. \n2. Evaluation and testing of the methodology within the context of SMEs in Singapore. \n3. Analysis to determine the strengths and weaknesses of the methodology and opportunities \nfor further research.    \n \nThe research aim and objectives have naturally led to a three-phase structured research \nprogramme, which is outlined as follows. \n \nPhase 1: review of literature and selection of methodology \nA thorough review of the literature was carried out with the purpose of identifying a suitable \nmethodology for further evaluation and testing. To do this, this research used the \n12  \ncharacteristics of the SMEs to select the methodology that closely matched the specific \ncharacteristics of their business. Through interviews with a few companies and information \ngathered, some of the guiding characteristics of SMEs for selecting the suitable methodology \nare:  1. SMEs need to be part of the supply chain revolution to remain competitive; 2.  SMEs \nneed guidance in the formal process of strategic planning and those that are incapable of \npreparing strategic plans are unlikely to be successful in the supply chain; 3. SMEs need to \nfocus on a small number of activities and excel in one carefully defined capability and retain \nmerely adequate capabilities in other requirements; 4. SMEs have fewer resources and can \nafford fewer mistakes - Decision-making capabilities are therefore more critical in SMEs than \nin large companies; 5. SMEs must reassess their competitive positions and those of their \nsupply chains on a regular basis and position themselves to respond rapidly to changing \nconditions.  \n \nBased on these characteristics of SMEs, the integrated strategic positioning decision process \nprovided by Baines et al. [6] was found to be potentially the most suitable for SMEs in \nSingapore. The strategic positioning decision process is comprised of 5 Stages that take the \npractitioner through a review of competitive market strategy; identifying key decision criteria; \nmapping the activity landscape; assessing the impact of making a change; and then \nconsolidation of outcome. A brief outline of each of these 5 stages is described below. \n \nStage 1: Scope Issues \nThe first stage is about understanding how a company is competing in the market. Its purpose \nis to confirm a company\u2019s competitive strategy, check that any issues being raised are \n13  \nconsistent with this strategy, and explore any gaps that may exist between current and desired \nposition. An issues statement is then produced. \n \nStage 2: Identify Key Decision Criteria \nThis stage sets out to identify a balanced and weighted set of key decision criteria that the host \ncompany usually uses to evaluate project initiatives. These criteria are termed FACTS \n(Financial, Attitude\/Acceptability, Competence\/Capability, Technological and Strategic fit), \nand will ensure that any proposals generated are consistent with the form that business cases \ntake in the company. The output is a set of five balanced key decision criteria.   \n \nStage 3: Identify Activity Landscape \nThis stage identifies all the activities (internal and external, current and emerging) that are \nrelated to the delivery of the product and services to the customer, and from these selects the \nactivities that are most significant to the problem being addressed.  On completion of this stage, \nall significant activities will be identified that sit within the company, along with those in the \nwider supply chain relevant to the \u2018issue statement\u2019 generated in the first stage. \n \nStage 4: Assess Impact \nThis stage takes the selected significant activities from Stage 3, and assesses the impact of \nwhere a change in state would improve\/sustain business performance against Key Decision \nCriteria.  The final output from this stage is a ranked list of proposed activities identified for \nchange, in order of potential effectiveness to the business performance. \n \n14  \nStage 5: Consolidate Outcomes \nThe final stage is used to prepare a summary of the key outcomes from earlier stages.  This \nprovides an opportunity for a company to combine all the decisions agreed upon during the \nprocess and then provides a basis for validation and implementation. \n \nPhase 2: evaluation and testing of the methodology \nThis phase of the research was to assess and evaluate the effectiveness of the strategic supply \nchain positioning methodology for SMEs in industry, through testing of the methodology in \nindustrial applications. The overall goal of the testing was to observe the application of the \nmethodology in practice in order to evaluate whether it is workable, to determine whether the \nmethodology provides a practical, procedural step, and to establish future research needed to \nrefine and adapt the methodology for SMEs in Singapore catering for different industry sectors \nin the real world. In order to achieve this testing in a real industry setting, case study based \nresearch design was chosen. \n \nThe case study design was based on the work of Eisenhardt [75] and the techniques outlined by \nYin [76]. An important consideration in designing the study in this phase was the choice and \nnumber of companies at which to apply the process. To align with the research objective, one \ncompany from each of the 2 industry sectors of manufacturing and logistics were chosen. The \ndata collection protocol was then based on the work of Pettigrew [77] as this helped to capture \nthe relationship between context (different industry sectors) and process (methodology). The \npreference was also for high-level studies, where the decision process would be applied from \nstart to finish by senior executives (e.g. managing director, manufacturing director, marketing \n15  \ndirector, etc.). During this time, the three person research team would adopt the role of \nfacilitators following the model demonstrated by Platts and Gregory [78]. \n \nTo meet the objective to determine whether the methodology provides a practical, procedural \nstep during the workshop, three sets of criteria were used to assess the prescribed methodology \nagainst the objective. These performance criteria were adopted from the work of Platts [79], \nand were feasibility (could the process be followed?), usability (how easily could the process \nbe applied and followed?), and utility (did the process provide a useful output?). A short \nquestionnaire was developed to ask a series of questions based on these criteria. This was then \ncompleted by both the senior executives and also the facilitators, at each stage of the process \nand on final completion. This questionnaire therefore formed the basis of the data collection \nprotocol for each company, and the basis for reporting the outcomes of the research. In each \ncase, the senior management were required to fully commit to a series of three workshops \nspread over approximately four weeks, and agree to carry out any additional data collection or \nanalysis required between these. Section 4 of this paper describes each of these cases in detail. \n \nPhase 3: analysis and discussion of the results \nThe case studies of phase 2 were intended to provide detailed study and evaluation of the \napplication of the methodology and demonstrate its feasibility, usability and utility. This final \nphase 3 of the research was to analyse the strength, weaknesses, and opportunities of the \nmethodology. This analysis and discussion is presented in Section 5 of this paper. \n16  \n \n4.   EXECUTION OF THE CASE STUDY AND RESULTS OF APPLYING THE \n      METHODOLOGY IN SINGAPORE \n \nCase 1: Manufacturing Process and Measurement Equipment Solution Provider \nThe first study was at a company that specialises in electronics and automation and positions \nitself as a manufacturing process and measurement equipment solution provider. Established in \n1989, this organization started with manufacturing of equipment to support the CRT industry. \nIt has no standard product but provides services of electro-mechanical design solution for \nmanufacturing processes and measurements, custom-build process and measurement \nequipment and post-sales support serving the hard disk drive media manufacturing market in \nSingapore. The key business of the company is in providing solutions for manufacturing \nprocess & measurement equipment. The company agreed to a series of three full day \nworkshops, lasting over three weeks, and commencing in June 2005. These workshops were \nstructured around the methodology provided by Baines et al [6] (2005), and were executed as \nfollows. \n \nWorkshop 1- Stage 1:Scope Issues \nThe application of the strategic supply chain positioning methodology began with a workshop \ntargeted solely at stage 1, where the panel was guided to review their company\u2019s competitive \nstrategy, and identify gaps between company performance and both customer expectations and \ncompetitor performance. This initial stage was completed in two and half hours, with all \nmembers of the panel participating throughout. Here, the five steps in stage 1 provided an \n17  \noverarching structure, and as the panel followed these, the key competitive issue was identified \nas product (equipment) price and quality conformance.  \n \nWorkshop 2 - Stage 2: Identify Key Decision Criteria and Stage 3: Identify Activity Landscape \nThe second workshop focused on stages 2 and 3 of the methodology. The respective objectives \nof these stages are to establish a set of five balanced and weighted key decision criteria that are \nconsistent with the company\u2019s competitive strategy and usual approach to building business \ncases; and then mapping the landscape of manufacturing related activities both internal and \nexternal to the company. The workshop took place over one full day, with stage 2 taking two \nhours and stage 3 taking three and a half hours to complete. The analysis within stage 2 led the \npanel to identify that the company principally assessed new initiatives and projects in terms of \ncriteria of internal rate of return, management capability, resource capability, technical \ncapability and impact on competitiveness.  \n \nWithin stage 3, the panel carried out the analysis specified by the methodology and this was a \nlengthy exercise, as many manufacturing related activities were identified, and in many cases \nthe panel decomposed these to a considerable level of detail. Nevertheless, on completion of \nthe analysis the panel had successfully identified ten significant activities within manufacture \nto carry forward to the final workshop. \n \nWorkshop 3 - Stage 4: Assess Impact and Stage 5: Consolidate Outcomes \nThe third workshop focused on stages 4 and 5, and here the panel was first guided to assess the \nimpact of change, and then to confirm and summarise the key outcomes from the complete \nmethodology. This final workshop took four hours to complete. Stage 4 required the majority \n18  \nof this time (three-and-a-half hours), as the analysis required the panel to judge how each \nsignificant activity (from stage 3), and then related activities (stage 3) would be affected if the \nstate of ownership is changed, and to make this judgement in terms of the key decision criteria \n(from stage 2). The outcome of this analysis was very significant. Five key initiatives were \nidentified, with the most critical of these being \u201cdevelop technology and competency\u201d. \nCurrently, the company did not have significant technology and competency capability to \ndesign and develop high quality and cost effective equipment, and the outcome from this \nanalysis was that if this infrastructure activity was strengthened, then competitiveness should \nbe significantly enhanced. Stage 5 then led the panel to agree that the company needed to \nverify this decision by confirming the accuracy of the data used, and then to adopt as a priority \na series of initiatives to create the develop technology and competency capability.  \n \nIn terms of the overall results from this case, as corresponding with the research design \noutlined earlier, on completion of each stage of the decision process, each member of the panel \nwas asked to complete a short questionnaire. This set out to assess their level of understanding, \nparticipation, and the value that individual members placed on the analysis. In addition, the \nresearch team (who had acted as facilitators throughout the workshops), gathered similar data \nabout the panel and themselves. On completion of the final workshop, the panel was also asked \ndirectly about feasibility (could the process be followed?), usability (how easily could the \nprocess be applied and followed?), utility (did the process provide a useful output?). In this \ncase the result was that the methodology could be applied within the anticipated timescales; \nthat the analysis in each stage did not overly depend on facilitation and so was sufficiently easy \n19  \nto apply; and that in altering the company\u2019s current sourcing initiatives it had been successful \nin producing a good output. \n \nCase 2: Third Party Logistics Service Provider \n \nThe second study was with a third party logistics service provider. This company has clearly \nestablished itself as Singapore\u2019s premier logistics operator, specializing in a variety of logistics \nfunctions including transportation, warehousing, freight forwarding, bonded services as well as \nlogistics management consultancy services. The company has a strong \u201cPartner in Total \nLogistics\u201d philosophy and this is reflected clearly in the development of their logistics physical \ninfrastructure that are designed specifically to fit the needs and requirements of their customers. \n \nThe company was approached in a similar manner to the first case, and the study commenced \nin early August 2005. In this case, the managing director perceived the complete outsourcing \nof the IT system as a threat to the company and was keen for this to be explored. He wanted to \ndrive the company to be the best and to grow and continue to develop on other inhouse \ncapabilities, such as IT, so as to offer complete professionalism directly matching the needs of \nthe customers. \n \nWorkshop 1- Stage 1:Scope Issues \nThe application of the strategic supply chain positioning methodology followed an identical \nformat to case 1. The first workshop focused on stage 1, and the analysis led the panel to \nspecify that their desired competitive strategy was greater customer intimacy. This workshop \ntook two and a half hours to complete, and there was unanimous agreement that the desired \n20  \ncompetitive strategy should be customer intimacy to enable the company to compete in the \nmarket. The analysis led the panel to agree on the issue statement being to develop in-house \ncapabilities to further achieve greater service customisation.  \n \nWorkshop 2 - Stage 2: Identify Key Decision Criteria and Stage 3: Identify Activity Landscape \nThe second workshop again focused on stages 2 and 3, and required three and four hours \nrespectively to complete. Here, the key decision criteria were principally return on investment, \nmanagement capability, core competences, technology capability, and strategic fit. Stage 3 led \nto the identification of logistics related activities, and these included, for example: \u201cdeveloping \nin-house IT capability\u201d; \u201cdeveloping in-house manpower capability\u201d; \u201cenhancing logistics \nresearch & development\u201d; and \u201cproviding state-of-the-art logistics solutions\u201d. This last \ninitiative would mean the company developing a capability to provide complete logistics \nsolutions to compete more on service customization supported by their IT, logistics \ninfrastructure and manpower capabilities.  \n \nWorkshop 3 - Stage 4: Assess Impact and Stage 5: Consolidate Outcomes \nThe third and final workshop took just two hours to complete stage 4 and a half-hour to \ncomplete stage 5. From the analysis in stage 4, it became apparent that the strongest initiative \nwas \u201cdeveloping in-house IT capability\u201d. Stage 5 then captured the subsequent actions and \nresponsibilities for further validation and implementation of the four strongest initiatives.  \n \nThe overall results from this second case matched closely to those gained from the first study. \nThe assessment process was identical, with responses of the panel and facilitators being \ngathered after each stage and on completion. Again the result was that the decision process \n21  \ncould be applied within the anticipated timescales; that the analysis in each stage did not \noverly depend on facilitation and so was sufficiently easy to apply; and that in altering the \ncompany\u2019s current sourcing initiatives it had been successful in producing a good output. \n \n5. ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION \nThis section describes objective 3 of the research programme. The purpose here was to analyse \nthe case study results in a structured form. First the strengths of the methodology are \nconsidered, followed by the analysis of the weaknesses, and finally opportunities for new \nresearch will be described.  \n \n5.1 Strengths of the Methodology \nFrom the case studies, we can observe that there are quite a number of strengths in the \nmethodology provided by Baines et al [6]. First, as a whole, the methodology is very \ncomprehensive and systematic comprising of five stages; stage 1 - scope issues; stage 2 \u2013 \nidentify key decision criteria; stage 3 \u2013 identify activity landscape; stage 4 \u2013 assess impact; and \nfinally stage 5: consolidate outcomes. With these five stages, it is structured to consider \nholistically and simultaneously the strategic supply chain positioning decision from the view of \nthe manufacturing operation and the four interfaces with the wider supply chain networks. The \nmethodology also considers that the activities in a company and its supply chain are dynamic \nin nature and have emerging, mature or declining capabilities that will change as time goes by. \nFinally, the methodology provides a link from the decision about the activity ownership to the \ncompetitive strategy of the company to identify its competitive space. \n \n22  \nSecond, each of the stages also has their own unique strength. Stage 1 provides a useful set of \nkey criteria to help companies identify their competitive strategy, be it operational excellence, \nproduct leadership or customer intimacy. For stage 2, the process provides a balanced and \nweighted set of quantitative and qualitative decision criteria that will be used for the evaluation \nof proposed changes generated by the strategic positioning analysis. Similar to stage 1, stage 2 \nalso provides some initial suggested factors in each of the decision criteria to guide a company \nin their decision process. In stage 3, it provides a generic approach in identifying significant \nactivities from all aspects of a company\u2019s possible competitiveness. In addition, the \nmethodology goes further to identify their key enabling related activities. And finally, the \nmethodology is also designed so that it takes a dynamic view of the activity landscape and \ncaptures not only mature activities but also emergent and declining activities.  This is very \nimportant as it would otherwise be possible to miss out growing influences in the market place \nor to waste time considering activities that will not be prevalent in the future. In stage 4, the \nprocess provides a ranked listing of those where a change in ownership (such as outsource, \ninsource) or change of state (such as grow, strengthen or eliminate need for) would have a \npositive benefit to the business performance, as detailed in the stage 1, by defining the \ncondition of the SAs using a form of SWOT analysis and then deciding the most appropriate \naction that could be taken to improve the issue scoped. This stage also provides a detailed \nqualitative impact analysis using the Key Decision Criteria (and their relative weightings).   \n \n5.2 Weaknesses of the Methodology \nIn the application of the methodology, we have also noted a number of weaknesses of the \ndecision process. First, on the whole, the methodology is developed mainly for the \nmanufacturing companies and not for companies in other industries such as logistics. During \n23  \nour case study with the logistics company, changes and close discussion and guidance featured \nheavily during stages 1, 2 and 3. In addition, the methodology is developed from the \nperspective of larger multinational companies (MNCs) and not specifically for the SMEs. \nUnlike the MNCs, the organization of the SMEs are quite different and are comparatively \nsmall and flat in structure, which means that they require the methodology to cater for the \ncompany as a whole instead of individual SBU or product type. Another weakness is that the \nmethodology is dependent on the skills and experience of the facilitators as well as the panel \nmembers. This is especially so during stage 3, to guide the practitioners to map the \norganisation to an appropriate level of detail, and during stage 4 where the facilitators guided \npractitioners to judge impact assessments carefully.  \n \nSecond, for the various stages within the process itself, there are also weaknesses. In stage 1, \nas explained previously, the key criteria for identification of competitive strategy largely cater \nfor the manufacturing companies. Several key criteria need to be modified to suit companies in \nother industry sectors. This is also the case with stage 2 where the quantitative and qualitative \ndecision criteria need to be modified, although to a lesser extend.  \n \nFor stage 3, the main weakness is the overly time consuming task required to map the \nmanufacturing related activities, both inside and outside the organisation, that may in some \nway be relevant to the issues being addressed. Considerable time is needed to conduct this \nanalysis, and strong facilitation appears very important if the panel is to avoid becoming \noverwhelmed by detail. Again, the suggested activities in the methodology are all \nmanufacturing activities and efforts are needed to change those activities for other industries. \n24  \nFor activity mapping, the guideline provided to map according to internal and external \nactivities for the 4KBAs of suppliers, customers, infrastructure and product range may not be \ndirectly obvious to the people from industry. Also there is no structured multi-level method to \nguide the panel members to look at activities in the company systematically one level at a time \nand to link significant activities to related activities. Within the decision aid, the infrastructure \nboundary is open to misinterpretation and is difficult to map, it is not clear what should be \nincluded under this banner (e.g.: technology, human resources, information, knowledge) and \nhow it should be dealt with. Other weaknesses for stage 3 include mapping the product range \nand the down stream boundary and, in particular, distinguishing between products and services.  \n \n5.3 Opportunities to Improve Methodology  \nThe opportunities to improve the methodology can be derived from the analysis of the \nstrengths and weaknesses outlined in the previous sections. There are a number of \nopportunities that exist to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the strategic supply \nchain methodology. First, overall, the structure of the methodology can be simplified to cater \nfor the SMEs and for different industry sectors, other than just for manufacturing. Second, for \nchanges to the individual stages, as discussed earlier, stages 1, 2 and 3 require some \nmodifications as they are not generic in terms of industry sectors and maybe could be \nstreamlined if some form of generic key criteria, decision criteria and activity map could be \nproposed. A generic map would contain the common criteria and activities and more unusual \ncriteria and activities could be added specific to a particular company or industry sector. \nPerhaps the generic map could exist in the form of SCOR models to assist in systematically \n25  \nlooking at activities one level at a time. Finally, there are also opportunities to further integrate \nthe methodology with other alternative operations strategy or analysis techniques. \n \n6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH \nConcluding remarks \nThis paper has illustrated the challenges facing SMEs in Singapore and the critical need for a \ncoordinated and holistic approach towards the decision making process in the form of an \nintegrated strategic supply chain positioning methodology to help them define their \ncompetitive space so as to maximise business and survive the global competition. From the \nliterature review, the integrated decision process provided by Baines et al. [6] was found to be \npotentially the most suitable for SMEs in Singapore, but the challenge was to evaluate and test \nthe process with SMEs and to identify future research to fit the methodology more closely for \nuse by SMEs in Singapore. To do this, the process was then applied and evaluated in 2 \nindustrial case studies.  Results of the case studies were analysed and the strengths, weaknesses \nand opportunities were evaluated and discussed in detail. Further research to improve the \neffectiveness of the strategic supply chain positioning methodology to suit the SMEs in \nSingapore will be discussed in the next section. \n \nFuture research initiatives \nAs evident from the analysis of the results from the case studies, a few of the weaknesses of \nthe current methodology have been identified which have opportunities for future research \ninitiatives. These can be summarized into two main sets of research. Firstly, further research is \nneeded to simplify the overall structure of the methodology to cater for the SMEs as well as \n26  \nmake it applicable for different industry sectors, like the logistics industry. In addition, the \nmethodology needs to be made more generic and undergo further testing to confirm generic \nreliability so that it does not depend on the skills and experience of the facilitators. Secondly, \nat the individual stage level, further research is needed to explore some form of generic key \ncriteria, decision criteria and activity map for stages 1, 2 and 3 respectively in terms of catering \nfor different industry sectors. For a generic activity map, some form of modelling methods, \nlike a SCOR model, also need to be studied and suitable models selected to assist in the \nsystematic mapping of activities at different levels. Other research initiatives would include \nintegrating the methodology with other alternative operational analysis techniques. With these \nfuture research initiatives identified, there will be further refinement of this work and look \nforward to reporting on progress. \n \nReferences \n[1] Piachaud, B.
