INTRODUCTION\nA wide variety of structural phenomena have been predicted\nand observed in the region of the nuclear chart near doubly-\nmagic 208Pb in nuclei with N \u0001 126. These nuclei can be\npopulated via fusion evaporation reactions and studied using\ngamma ray spectroscopic methods. Their structural features\ninclude shears bands, superdeformation, and shape coexis-\ntence, among others (for example, Refs. [1\u20136]). Coupling of\nsingle-particle states to the Pb core is important in these nuclei\nbecause of nearby magic numbers N = 126 and Z = 82.\nA considerable amount of spectroscopic information is\navailable for isotopes with Z\u0001 82 [7\u201320]; however, for nuclei\nwith Z > 82, the situation is less satisfying. The structure of\neven-even Po, Rn, and, to a lesser extent, Ra nuclei have been\nwell-established, but relatively less spectroscopic information\nis available for odd-Z isotopes. Even less spectroscopic infor-\nmation is available for doubly odd nuclei. One reason for this\ndearth of experimental information is the rapidly increasing\nfissility. To overcome this difficulty, careful experimental\nselection of fusion-evaporation residues becomes critical.\nIn addition, for odd and doubly odd nuclei, single particle\nstates with different proton and neutron configurations occur\nat similar energies and can be difficult to resolve. Thus,\nin addition to the large fission competition (and reduced\nfusion evaporation cross section) the level schemes of these\nnuclei are generally more complicated than their even-even\ncounterparts. However, study of the odd isotopes provides\nuseful information about the degrees of freedom of the odd\nparticle and thus can give direct insights into the structure and\ndeformation of these nuclei and the mechanisms that affect the\nevolution of structure and shape.\nPrior to this work, spectroscopic information for Fr isotopes\nbelow the closed neutron shell at N = 126 was very limited,\nand was available only for 213Fr (N = 126), 212Fr (N = 125),\nand 211Fr (N = 124) [21]. Excited states in these nuclei have\nbeen interpreted in terms of single particle configurations\nof a few valence particles outside the N = 126 closed\nshell. (Information for 210Fr, populated via alpha decay of\n214Ac, also exists [22].) In an effort to extend the scope of\nspectroscopic information in this region to lighter systems,\ndecays above and below a new isomeric state in 209Fr are\nreported here for the first time.\nII. EXPERIMENT\nExperiments to populate excited states in 209Fr were\nperformed at the Wright Nuclear Structure Laboratory at Yale\nUniversity. In the first, a beam of 37Cl ions incident on a\nthin (1 mg\/cm2) 176Yb target produced Fr and Rn isotopes\nvia the (37Cl, xn \u03b3 ) and (37Cl, pxn \u03b3 ) reaction channels,\nrespectively, at beam energies of 173, 179, and 185 MeV. An\narray of six Compton-suppressed clover HPGe detectors, each\nwith \u223c150% relative efficiency, detected prompt gamma rays\nemitted at the target position. These detectors were situated in\ntwo rings of the YRAST Ball array [23] with two detectors at\n90\u25e6 to the beam axis and four detectors at 138.5\u25e6 to the beam\naxis. The overall efficiency of the array in this configuration is\n\u223c1.8% at 1.3 MeV.\nFollowing the fusion evaporation reaction, recoiling fu-\nsion products were selected using the Small Angle Sepa-\nrator System at Yale for Evaporation Residues (SASSYER,\nRef. [24]). The spectrometer was filled with 0.8(1) Torr He\ngas, contained by a thin (50 mg\/cm2) C foil placed 1.5 m\nupstream of the target chamber. The beam lost nearly 0.8 MeV\ntraversing the carbon window. SASSYER was set to select\nA = 209 recoils with a magnetic rigidity of 1.9 Tm.

The recoils are then focused to\nthe focal plane by setting the fields of two dipole magnets and one\nquadrupole magnet. Recoiling nuclei are detected in SCARY, an array\nof 30 solar cells. Prompt gamma rays are detected using YRAST Ball,\nand delayed gamma rays are detected using Ge detectors around the\nfocal plane.\nfragments and unreacted beam particles, well separated from\nfusion products, were bent into a beam dump box located at\nthe first dipole of SASSYER.\nAfter a \u223c2.4 m flight path, recoils were implanted into a\nsolar cell array consisting of 30 Si solar cells located at the\nfocal plane of SASSYER. Mass A \u223c 209 recoils, traveling at\na speed of 0.0155c (as experimentally measured for A = 209\nrecoils using the Doppler shift observed in clover detectors at\nthe target position) have a time of flight through SASSYER of\n\u223c500 ns from production to implantation at the focal plane.\nThe solar cell array was 3 cm high by 10 cm wide; each cell\ncovered an area of 1 cm2. This array gave the position and\nenergy of the recoils and generated the master trigger (start)\nfor each event. Since the area covered by each element of the\nsolar cell array is too large for recoil-decay-tagging, simple\nrecoil-tagging was used to correlate implantation with either\nprior gamma decay at the target position or subsequent gamma\ndecay from isomeric states at the focal plane.\nTo detect such gamma rays emitted from the decay of\nisomeric states, three clover detectors were placed in close\nproximity to the focal plane chamber. Two of these were placed\nfacing the sides of the solar cell array, while the third was\nplaced directly behind the array. The experiment was sensitive\nto lifetimes on the order of \u223c10 ns measured at the target\nposition and from about 300 ns to 8 \u00b5s at the focal plane.\nA schematic diagram of the experimental setup is shown in\nFig. 1.\nFor the 173, 179, and 185 MeV beam energies, 40, 12, and\n98 h of data, respectively, were taken with an average beam\ncurrent of Ib \u223c 4 pnA. At a beam energy of 185 MeV, a total of\n7.5 \u00d7 106 recoils, 2.5 \u00d7 106 recoil-gamma, 0.8 \u00d7 106 recoil-\ngamma-gamma, 9.7 \u00d7 104 recoil-isomer, 3.0 \u00d7 104 recoil-\nisomer-isomer, and 7.7 \u00d7 104 recoil-gamma-isomer unfolded\ncoincidence events were recorded. For the last 53 h of data\ntaken at 185 MeV, approximately half of the time spent at\nthis beam energy, the master trigger condition was changed\nto record data either when an event occurred in the solar cell\narray or when the prompt gamma ray multiplicity was greater\nthan or equal to 3.\nA second experiment was performed using only the\nCompton suppressed HPGe detectors of YRAST Ball at the\ntarget position of SASSYER. For this experiment, 16O ions at\n90 MeV were incident on a thick (4 mg\/cm2) 197Au target.\nThe target was sufficiently thick to stop recoiling fusion\nevaporation products, and the beam energy was chosen to\nmatch the excitation energy of the fusion products produced in\nthe thin target experiment. This beam energy was also chosen\nto maximize the yield of Fr evaporation residues relative to\nthe fission channel [25]. The beam lost \u223c6 MeV in the target\n[26], and 210Fr was primarily populated. Using a coincidence\nrequirement of three or more suppressed clover detectors,\napproximately 8 \u00d7 107 unfolded gamma-gamma events were\ncollected over a period of 29 h.\nIII. RESULTS\nNo spectroscopic information for excited states in Fr nuclei\nwith N < 124 (lighter than 211Fr) was available prior to these\nexperiments. Therefore, gamma rays were assigned to Fr based\non coincidences with Fr x-rays and to specific isotopes based\non the results of our excitation function measurement using\nthe thin target data collected at three beam energies (173, 179,\nand 185 MeV) and on gamma-gamma coincidences.

Bottom: Portion of the spectrum indicated by dashed box in\n(a) between the 194 and 632 keV gamma rays at (b) 173, (c) 179,\nand (d) 185 MeV beam energies. The varying strengths of the 3, 4,\nand 5 particle channels are evident from the relative intensities of the\ncorresponding gamma rays.\nexcitation function measurement, the variation, as a function\nof beam energy, of the intensities of both prompt and delayed\n(measured at the focal plane of SASSYER) gamma rays was\nobserved. To account for the different beam fluxes at the three\nbeam energies, the gamma ray intensities were normalized\nto the 188 keV 4+ to 2+ transition in the Coulomb-excited\n176Yb target. In the energy range from 173\u2013185 MeV, the\ntotal Coulomb-excitation cross section, calculated according\nto Ref. [27], for this state is essentially constant. The resulting\nexcitation function measurement is shown in Fig. 2. As can\nbe seen, known transitions in 208Rn, populated following the\np4n reaction, exhibit an upward trend with increasing beam\nenergy, establishing the excitation function of the five-particle\nevaporation channel. In contrast, previously unknown and\nunplaced transitions from Fr isotopes constitute the majority\nof the gamma rays following downward (three particle) and\npeaked (four particle) trends.\nDelayed gamma rays emitted within 8 \u00b5s of recoil implan-\ntation were detected at the focal plane. While the statistics are\nsomewhat poorer, the focal plane spectra are extremely clean,\nmaking unambiguous measurements possible. The spectrum\nof gamma rays detected following a recoil implantation is\nshown in Fig. 3. As can be seen, it is dominated by the 194\nand 632 keV transitions. In addition to these gamma-rays,\nthe known 325, 636, 778 keV transitions, below the 487 ns\n8+ isomer in 208Rn [15], are seen as well as many other less\nintense, previously unplaced transitions. As demonstrated by\nthe known transitions in 208Rn, the shape of the excitation\nfunction for gamma rays detected at the focal plane mirrors\nthat of the excitation function for prompt gamma rays. Thus,\nthe excitation function, measured either at the target position or\nat the SASSYER focal plane, can be used to assign transitions\nto specific nuclei.\nThe excitation function for the 194 and 632 keV\ngamma rays indicates that they belong to the four-particle\nchannel. They are mutually coincident and also coincident\nwith the 86 keV Fr x-ray detected at the focal plane. In\naddition, these delayed transitions are correlated with prompt\n86 and 97 keV Fr x-rays detected at the target position. The\ncombination of excitation function and x-ray coincidence data\nunambiguously place the 194 and 632 keV transitions in 209Fr.\nThe half-lives of the states depopulated by these transitions\ncan be determined from a weighted fit to the time difference\nbetween recoil implantation and gamma decay for each tran-\nsition. Using this method, we obtain a half-life of 482(20) ns\nfor the isomer in 208Rn (325 keV transition, see Fig. 4) which is\n1\n10\n208Rn  t1\/2 = 482(20) ns\ngate on 325 keV\nco\nu\nn\nts\n\/1\n0 \nns\n1\n10\n100\n209Fr  t1\/2 = 446(14) ns\ngate on 632 keV\nco\nu\nn\nts\n\/1\n0 \nns\n0 1000 2000 3000\n1\n10\n210Fr  t1\/2 = 360(140) ns\ngate on 433 keV\ntime (ns)\nco\nu\nn\nts\n\/1\n0 \nns\nFIG. 4.

PHYSICAL REVIEW C 73, 024307 (2006)\nin excellent agreement with the previously measured value of\n487(12) ns [15]. Similar fits for the 194 and 632 keV transitions\nshow that they have the same half-life, indicating that both\ntransitions follow from the decay of the same isomeric state\nin 209Fr. The half-life of this new isomer is measured to be\n446(14) ns; the decay curve for the 632 keV transition is shown\nin Fig. 4.\nAs can be seen in Fig. 3, the intensity of many of the\nother isomeric transitions is greatest at the lowest beam\nenergy (173 MeV), suggestive of a 3n evaporation channel\nand an assignment to 210Fr. The coincidence data at the\nfocal plane for these transitions have very low statistics\nand makes assignment to any isotope challenging. However,\nplacement of these transitions in 210Fr was confirmed by the\nthick target experiment in which the same transitions were\nstrongly populated. In this experiment, a 90 MeV 16O beam\nincident on a 4 mg\/cm2 197Au target strongly populated 210Fr\nvia the 3n channel. Here the assignment to Fr (based on\nx-ray coincidences) is unambiguous, and the assignment to\n210Fr is based on the thin target excitation function and the\nrelative excitation energy of the two compound systems. It\nwas found that many of the transitions, observed at the focal\nplane of SASSYER in the thin target experiment, are mutually\ncoincident using the thick target data. Hence, we can deduce\nthat there is at least one long-lived high spin isomer in 210Fr.\nAlthough the statistics at the focal plane are very poor for\nthese transitions, a similar weighted fit to the half-life of the\n433 keV state yields a 360(140) ns half-life, shown in Fig. 4.\nThe intensities for all of the delayed transitions are listed in\nTable I, where they have been corrected for relative efficiency\nunder the approximation that radiation from the extended solar\ncell array is similar to 152Eu and 133Ba point sources placed\nnear the center of the solar cell array. For the 210Fr transitions,\nonly the isotope assignment is given here; detailed results for\nthis nucleus will be presented in a subsequent publication [28].\nAs for the delayed transitions, prompt transitions tagged\nby recoils in the solar cell array were assigned to a specific\nelement based on x-ray coincidences and to 209Fr by the\nexcitation function results and by coincidences with delayed\ngamma-rays detected at the focal plane. For example, prompt\ntransitions coincident with the 194 and 632 keV delayed\ntransitions are shown in Fig. 5. These are assigned as higher\nTABLE I.

Nevertheless, tentative spin assignments can\nbe made by assuming that for stretched transitions, quadrupole\ntransitions are more intense in the backward (138.5\u25e6) ring,\nwhile dipole transitions are more intense in the ring at 90\u25e6.\nTentative spins and parities for the levels are assigned using\nthis information as well as by comparison to the systematic\ntrends of neighboring isotopes. The energies and intensities\nof transitions observed in the prompt gamma ray spectrum are\nshown in Table II. The statistics at the focal plane are sufficient\nto allow reliable coincidence data for the 632 and 194 keV\ntransitions. A gate placed on the 194 keV transition brings\nback only the 632 keV transition. A gate on the 632 transition\nbrings back the 194 keV transition and Fr x-rays as would\nbe expected from the substantial internal conversion of such a\nlow energy transition. Since the 632 and 194 keV transitions\nare fed from the same isomeric level and these nuclei have\nbeen selected using SASSYER, there is no possibility for side\nfeeding. Therefore, the intensities of the two transitions at the\nfocal plane must be equal. This intensity balance argument was\nused to deduce the internal conversion coefficient, \u03b1 = 0.5(2),\nfor the 194 keV transition, which is consistent with either an\nE1 or E2 assignment.\nTABLE II.

DISCUSSION\nThe deformation for 209Fr, with Z = 87 and N = 122 and\nlying close the the doubly magic 208Pb, is expected to be\nsmall. This is expectation is reinforced by ultimate cranker\ncalculations (Fig. 7, Ref. [29]) that predict an equilibrium\ndeformation corresponding to an oblate shape, with a small\n\u00042 \u223c 0.05. This shape is more or less independent of the single\nparticle configuration or signature. Single particle excitations\nwill play a major role in the structure of 209Fr as they do in\nneighboring nuclei. For this deformation, the relevant single\nparticle proton orbits are \u03c01h9\/2, \u03c02f7\/2, and \u03c01i13\/2 while\nthe relevant high-j neutron orbital is \u03bd1h9\/2.\nStates built upon these orbitals feature prominently in the\nneighboring odd proton Bi (Z = 83) and At (Z = 85) nuclei.\nThe ground states are typically based on the \u03c0h9\/2 orbital.\nExcited states in the odd-Bi [12,14,16] isotopes, plotted in\nFig. 8, show the trends in excitation energy of the different\nsingle proton orbitals. As can be seen, the f7\/2 orbital lies at\nan excitation energy of \u223c700\u2013800 keV, and the i13\/2 orbital\nlies at a higher energy of \u223c1600 keV. These energies remain\nrelatively constant with decreasing neutron number (down to\nN = 120).\nIn the odd-At (Z = 85, Refs. [14,16,18]) isotopes, these\nsingle particle states are less easily picked out of the\nexisting level schemes. However, some indication of their\nexcitation energy can be inferred by looking at the energies\nof states of the maximally aligned 23\/2\u2212\u03c0f7\/2 \u2297 (\u03c0h9\/2)2\nand 29\/2+\u03c0i13\/2 \u2297 (\u03c0h9\/2)2 configurations. Although not all\nof these states have been identified for these couplings, the\ngeneral trends as a function of neutron number are shown\nin Fig. 8.

Levels [12,14,16,18,21] in the odd Bi, At, and Fr isotopes\nindicative of the relative energies of the orbitals. The 29\/2+ and 25\/2+\nstates are likely members of the \u03c0i13\/2 \u2297 \u03c0 (h9\/2)2 configuration.\nThe 23\/2\u2212 and 21\/2\u2212 maximally aligned states presumably have the\n\u03c0f7\/2 \u2297 \u03c0 (h9\/2)2 and \u03c0 (h9\/2)3 configurations, respectively.\n23\/2\u2212\u03c0f7\/2 \u2297 (\u03c0h9\/2)2 states remains relatively constant,\nthe 29\/2+ and 25\/2+ \u03c0i13\/2 \u2297 (\u03c0h9\/2)26 states appear to\ncome down in energy. The 25\/2+ state approaches the\nexcitation energy of the 23\/2\u2212[\u03c0f7\/2 \u2297 (\u03c0h9\/2)2] state at\nN = 120. The relative spacing between what are likely the\n25\/2+ (\u03c0i13\/2 \u2297 [(\u03c0h9\/2)2]6) and 23\/2\u2212 states is also impor-\ntant. In the odd proton nuclei where the states are known\nand where the 25\/2+ lies above the 23\/2\u2212 (211At, 205At, and\n211Fr), the typical decay path is from the maximally aligned\n29\/2+ state via the 25\/2+ member of the same multiplet to the\n23\/2\u2212 and thence to the 21\/2\u2212 maximally aligned states. From\nthe 21\/2\u2212 \u03c0 (h9\/2)3 state the decay path proceeds to the h9\/2\nground state via a cascade of three stretched E2 transitions.\nOften the maximally aligned states are isomeric. As the 25\/2+\nstate comes down in energy, the relative spacing between it and\nthe 23\/2\u2212 state becomes smaller, and the decay between them\nis somewhat inhibited. Thus, it appears that with increasing\nnumbers of valence particles, the i13\/2 orbit comes down in\nenergy relative to the f7\/2 orbit.\nWith the addition of two more valence protons in the odd-Fr\nisotopes, we would expect a similar, if not stronger, lowering of\nthe energy of the i13\/2 orbital. For example, the relative spacing\nen\ner\ngy\n (\nM\neV\n) \n \nen\ner\ngy\n (\nM\neV\n)\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n205At 207At\n25.5 ns\n209At\n9\/2\u2212\n13\/2\u2212\n17\/2\u2212\n35.1 ns\n21\/2\u2212\n211At\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n207Fr 209Fr\n2.1 ns\n211Fr\n9\/2\u2212\n13\/2\u2212\n18 ns 17\/2\u2212\n499 ns21\/2\u2212\n213Fr\nFIG. 9. Comparison of level spacings of the (h9\/2)3 configurations\nin the odd-At [14,16,18] and odd-Fr [21] isotopes.\nof the 25\/2+ and 23\/2\u2212 states is only 450 keV in 211Fr [21].\nIn 209Fr, with two additional neutron holes, it is plausible that\nthe i13\/2 orbit has come down in energy (or the f7\/2 orbit\nhas gone up) such that the 25\/2+ energy is comparable to\nor even below that of the 23\/2\u2212 state. In this case, rather\nthan change configurations, the decay path should primarily\npopulate the remaining 21\/2+, 17\/2+, and 13\/2+ members\nof the \u03c0i13\/2 \u2297 (\u03c0h9\/2)2 configuration. In addition to the\nexcitation energies of the levels, we can compare the number\nof transitions in a cascade to the number expected for different\nconfigurations. For example, either the \u03c0i13\/2 \u2297 \u03c0 (h9\/2)2 or\nthe \u03c0f7\/2 \u2297 \u03c0 (h9\/2)2 configuration allows four transitions,\nsince the odd proton occupies a different orbital than the pair\nof coupled protons. However, if the odd proton occupies the\nsame orbital as the pair of coupled protons \u03c0h9\/2 \u2297 \u03c0 (h9\/2)2,\nthe odd proton Pauli blocks one of the spin states, and only\nthree transitions are observed.\nWith this background, we now turn to a discussion of the\nlevel scheme of 209Fr, shown in Fig. 6. The cascade consisting\nof the 632, 724, and 359 keV transitions, shown on the left\nof Fig. 6, is consistent with \u03c0h9\/2 \u2297 \u03c0 (h9\/2)2 configuration.\nThe excitation energy of these levels fits the systematics of the\nAt nuclei very well, as seen in Fig. 9. We tentatively assign\nthe levels at 632, 1356, and 1715 keV as the members of the\n\u03c0 (h9\/2)3 multiplet.\nThe isomeric level at 826 keV is fed by a cascade of four\ntransitions of energies 568, 404, 468, and 344 keV as expected\nfor members of the \u03c0i13\/2 \u2297 \u03c0 (h9\/2)2 or \u03c0f7\/2 \u2297 \u03c0 (h9\/2)2\nconfiguration. (The angular distribution results for the 568\nand 404 keV transitions are consistent with stretched E2. The\nstatistics are too poor to allow multipolarity assignments for\nthe 468 and 344 keV transitions.) However, the excitation\nenergy of the isomeric level, 826 keV, is consistent with\nthe energy of the known 13\/2+ state in neighboring 205At\nand is significantly higher than the energy of the f7\/2 states\n024307-6\nFIRST INVESTIGATION OF EXCITED STATES IN . . .

Comparison of similar configurations in the N =\n122 Rn [15], Fr, and Ra [36] isotopes.\nin 205,207,209At (\u223c300\u2013500 keV). In addition, the conversion\ncoefficient deduced for the 194 keV transition is consistent\nwith an E1 assignment(13\/2+ \u2192 13\/2\u2212), but definitely rules\nout an M3 character (7\/2\u2212 \u2192 13\/2+). Thus we assign\nspin and parity of 13\/2+ to the level at 826 keV and the\n\u03c0i13\/2 \u2297 \u03c0 (h9\/2)2 configuration to this cascade.\nThe relative spacing of the \u03c0i13\/2 \u2297 \u03c0 (h9\/2)2 levels should\nbe similar to those depopulating the 8+ \u03c0 (h9\/2)2 isomers in\n208Rn and 210Ra, the neighboring N = 122 nuclei. The level\nspacings are compared in Fig. 10 where it can be seen that\nthey do indeed follow the same general pattern but with a more\nequal spacing in 209Fr. The alteration in this spacing could be\nan effect of the odd proton\u2019s interaction with the coupled h9\/2\nproton pair.\nWhen the structure of the nucleus is dominated by a\nrelatively high-j (j \u0002 7\/2) orbital, seniority, the number of\nunpaired particles, may be a good quantum number [30\u201334].\nIn this case, transitions can be classified as seniority changing\nor seniority conserving. The B(E2) values for these two\nclasses of transitions follow very different trends as a function\nof the fractional filling of the single particle orbit: bowl-\nshaped with the B(E2) minimizing in mid-shell for seniority\nconserving transitions and arch-shaped [B(E2) maximum in\nmidshell] for seniority changing transitions [35]. As shown\nin Ref. [30], the even-even nuclei in the translead region\n(Po, Rn, and Ra isotopes) are particularly good examples of\nthe seniority framework. In the 209Fr level scheme, the two\ncascades discussed above follow the expected pattern of\ntransitions depopulating a seniority isomer. The 632, 724,\nand 359 keV transitions are tentatively assigned the \u03c0h9\/2 \u2297\n\u03c0 (h9\/2)2 configuration, while the 568, 404, 468, and 344 keV\ncascade is tentatively assigned the \u03c0i13\/2 \u2297 \u03c0 (h9\/2)2 configu-\nration. For both, the h9\/2 high-j shell is filled to about mid shell,\nso that the B(E2) values for both the seniority conserving\n359 and 344 keV transitions are expected to be minimized.\nAssuming a generous upper limit of 1 W.u. for the B(E2)\nvalue, the lifetime of the maximally aligned seniority isomeric\nstates, depopulated by the 359 and 344 keV transitions, in\n209Fr is estimated to be less than a few ns. This is consistent\nwith the generally observed shorter halflives as we move away\nfrom magicity and with the observed 2.1 ns half-life of the\nequivalent state in 211Fr [21].\nV. CONCLUSION\nStates in 209Fr have been identified for the first time up\nto 2.6 MeV in excitation energy. Both prompt and delayed\ngamma ray spectra were used to construct the level scheme\nand identify the configurations of excited states in 209Fr. A\ncascade of three transitions depopulated what is probably the\n21\/2\u2212 maximally aligned \u03c0h39\/2 state at 1715 keV and feeds\nthe 9\/2\u2212 ground state. A configuration isomer, likely based on\nthe \u03c0i13\/2 state with a half-life of 446 ns was observed at an\nexcitation energy of 826 keV. Four transitions, with possible\n\u03c0i13\/2 \u2297 \u03c0 (h9\/2)2 configuration are found to feed into this\nisomeric level.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank G.
