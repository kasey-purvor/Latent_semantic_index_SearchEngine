Three electronic 7 \ndatabases and three journals were searched for behavioural interventions (aimed at 8 \nchanging dietary intake and\/or physical activity [PA]) for adults (mean BMI \u226530kg\/m 2; 9 \nmean age \u226540 years) with risk factors for morbidity, reporting follow-up data \u226512 10 \nweeks. 11 \nResults:  Forty-four RCTs met the inclusion criteria.  Behavioural outcomes, weight 12 \nloss, and cardiovascular disease risk factors showed consistent modest improvements 13 \nover time, especially for interventions targeting both diet and PA. 14 \nConclusion:  Behavioural interventions in at-risk populations showed positive effect 15 \ntendencies on behaviour, weight and disease risk factors.  However, there is still ample 16 \nroom for improvement and future research should focus on identifying the most 17 \neffective means of inducing dietary and PA behaviour change in this vulnerable 18 \npopulation.  19 \n20 \n 4 \nINTRODUCTION 21 \nThe prevalence of obesity worldwide is both high and increasing [1] .  Obesity is 22 \nassociated with numerous comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 23 \ndiabetes, hypertension, and certain cancers [2].  Behavioural interventions, aimed at 24 \ninfluencing peoples\u2019 dietary and\/or PA behaviour, lead to weight loss and improved 25 \nobesity-related risk factor profiles in individuals with excess weight [3-5]. 26 \nWhen studying obesity interventions, it is important to consider the influence of 27 \nadditional risk factors for morbidity1\nPrevious systematic reviews evaluating the effects of behavioural interventions 33 \npaid little attention to the most proximal target of behavioural weight-loss interventions, 34 \nbehaviour change itself [7].  As some intervention studies may not achieve significant 35 \nweight loss or improvement in health risk factors, information about behavioural change 36 \nis not only relevant but essential to our appraisal of the intervention.  Few systematic 37 \nreviews examine the effectiveness of behaviour change interventions on behaviour, 38 \nalthough evidence shows that dietary advice was found to lead to significant positive 39 \nchanges in self-reported fibre, fruit and vegetable, and saturated fat intake [8] and 40 \ninterventions promoting PA showed a significant moderate effect on self-reported PA 41 \n[9]\n as interventions in individuals carrying these risk 28 \nfactors may be less effective [3].  Clinically obese populations with additional risk 29 \nfactors are one of the fastest growing patient populations.  Consequently, it is 30 \nparamount to develop an understanding of the effects of behaviour change intervention 31 \non behaviour, weight and risk factor indicators in this population [6]. 32 \n2\nThis systematic review extends the evidence base for behavioural obesity 43 \ntreatment by addressing the lack of behavioural analysis in the scrutiny of intervention 44 \neffectiveness, and focuses attention on a population in need of intervention: obese 45 \nadults with additional risk factors for morbidity. 46 \n.  42 \nMETHODS 47 \nObjectives 48 \nTo review the effects of behavioural interventions for obese adults with at least one 49 \nadditional risk factor for morbidity on behaviour (diet and PA), weight and risk factors.  50 \nThe effect of interventions on outcomes were compared for intervention groups (which 51 \n                                                 \n1 For further discussion of additional risk factors, see Mokdad et al. 2003[73] \n2 For the purpose of this review dietary intake and PA are considered examples of behaviours. \n 5 \nfocused on changes in diet only, PA only, or both diet and PA) against control or less 52 \nintensive intervention groups. 53 \nStudy inclusion criteria 54 \nTypes of studies.  Published RCTs providing \u226512 weeks follow-up data after 55 \nrandomisation.  No language limitations were specified. 56 \nTypes of participants.  Individuals with a mean\/median BMI \u226530kg\/m2.  Studies 57 \nfocused on adult obesity with a mean\/median age of \u226540 as there is a rapid increase in 58 \nobesity-related diseases including the metabolic syndrome [10] and type 2 diabetes [11] 59 \nin middle age.  At least one additional risk factor for morbidity was required as this 60 \npopulation is in greatest need of behaviour change to prevent long-term morbidity. 61 \nTypes of interventions.  Behavioural interventions aimed at changing diet and\/or PA.  62 \nFor this review, interventions are classified by \u2018diet only (D-only),\u2019 \u2018PA only (PA-63 \nonly),\u2019 or \u2018diet and PA (D-PA)\u2019. 64 \nTypes of outcome measures.  The outcomes examined in this review were behaviour 65 \n(i.e. objective or self-reported measures of diet and\/or PA), weight and risk factors (total 66 \ncholesterol, low density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol, high density lipoprotein [HDL] 67 \ncholesterol, triglycerides, systolic and diastolic blood pressure [SBP and DBP], 68 \nglycosylated haemoglobin [HbA1c] and fasting plasma glucose [FPG]). 69 \nSearch strategy for identification of studies 70 \nThree electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycInfo) were searched for 71 \nrelevant studies using a comprehensive search strategy (available upon request).  Three 72 \njournals (International Journal of Obesity, International Journal of Behavioural 73 \nMedicine and Obesity Research) were searched by hand.  Reference lists of relevant 74 \nreview articles and of all included studies were searched for further studies. 75 \nMethods of the review 76 \nIdentification of RCTs.  The first 200 references of RCTs were independently screened 77 \nby two researchers (AA and SUD) and differences were resolved in discussion.  78 \nThereafter, the identification of studies was completed by one researcher (SUD). 79 \nQuality assessment of studies.  Standard criteria for RCTs were used to appraise the 80 \nmethodological quality [12]. 81 \nData extraction.  Three researchers (AA, FFS and SD) extracted data for an initial three 82 \nstudies, and differences were resolved by discussion.  Thereafter, one researcher (SUD) 83 \nextracted data for behaviour, weight and risk factors from the remaining studies. 84 \n 6 \nBehavioural variables were assessed by a wide variety of measures (Table 1).  85 \nMost studies focused on altering kilocalorie and fat intake, so these two outcomes 86 \nbecame the main dietary focus. These measures are a proxy for change in dietary 87 \nbehaviour and used as dietary behavioural outcomes for the purpose of the current 88 \nreview.  All data entry into meta-analytic software, Review Manager (Version 4.2), was 89 \ndouble checked one month after initial entry.   90 \nStatistical analysis.  Where possible, a meta-analysis of the data was undertaken to 91 \ndetermine the overall effect size.  Two different effect sizes were calculated depending 92 \non the outcomes under scrutiny [13].  Dietary fat and PA outcomes were assessed as 93 \nstandardised mean differences (SMDs), equivalent to Hedge\u2019s adjusted g, as both 94 \noutcome variables were reported on a variety of scales (see Table 1).   Kilocalorie, 95 \nweight and disease risk factor outcomes were reported on the same scales and were 96 \ncombined as mean differences (MDs).  Change scores for dietary fat, kcal and PA 97 \noutcomes were preferred and meta-analyses used a mixture of change from baseline and 98 \nfinal value scores [13].  Weight and disease risk factor outcomes were analysed as 99 \nchange scores, and missing data was imputed using methods previously described [12].   100 \nNinety-five percent confidence intervals (CIs) were derived for effect sizes.  101 \nDegree of inconsistency across studies was assessed using I2 [14].  I2 levels of \u226525% 102 \nand \u226550% were interpreted as an indicator for moderate and substantial heterogeneity 103 \nrespectively.  It should be noted that I2  is dependent on the number of primary studies 104 \nincluded and, in this case, there are some examples in which there are only a few 105 \nprimary studies.  I2 levels \u226550% were interpreted as an indicator for substantial 106 \nheterogeneity.  Random effects methods for combining data were used reflecting the 107 \nhigh heterogeneity in many of the meta-analyses.  Intention-to-treat data were used 108 \nwherever available [13]. 109 \n------------------------------Table 1 ------------------------------- 110 \n------------------------------ Figure 1 ------------------------------- 112 \nRESULTS 111 \nOverall description of studies 113 \nForty-four studies met inclusion criteria (Table 1). 114 \nParticipants.  The mean age of participants was 55.0 (SD = 6.8) and the mean BMI was 115 \n33.1 (SD = 2.2) ranging from 30.1 [15] to 38.8 [16].  In studies including participants of 116 \nboth genders, a small majority of women was reported (55%); eleven studies sampled 117 \nwomen exclusively, and one study only men [17].  The majority of studies (n=21) 118 \n 7 \nexamined individuals with type 2 diabetes.  Others included individuals with risk 119 \nfactors such as hypertension (n=4), impaired glucose tolerance (n=3), or cardiovascular 120 \ndisease (n=2) (see Table 1 for details).  Two studies used the same intervention for two 121 \ndifferent populations and were treated as separate studies [18, 19].  The mean number of 122 \nparticipants was 240 (SD = 502) ranging from 26 [20] to 3234 [21] with a mean dropout 123 \nat completion of 16% (SD = 10.2). 124 \nIntervention setting.  Most studies were conducted in the USA (n=27). Other countries 125 \nwere Canada (n=5), United Kingdom (n=5), the Australia (n=4), Finland (n=2) and 126 \nHolland (n=1).   127 \nStudy Designs.  Twenty-seven trials allowed for comparison between a D-PA 128 \nintervention against a usual care (UC) or waiting list control (WLC) group.  Six 129 \ncomparisons between D-only and six comparisons of PA-only against UC or WLC 130 \ngroup were possible.  Altogether, seven trials for D-PA and four for D-only 131 \ninterventions allowed comparison of more intensive against less intensive treatments.  132 \nInterventions were categorised as more intense when the behaviour change components 133 \nwithin the intervention were delivered more frequently in one of two intervention 134 \ngroups. Similarly, if one intervention utilised more intervention components compared 135 \nwith the other it was classified as more intensive. 136 \nIntervention duration and intensity.  The modal duration of interventions was 6 months 137 \n(n=12), ranging from 2 [22, 23] to 36 months [24].  The modal duration of follow-up 138 \nwas 12 months (n=15) ranging from 3 [25] to 36 months [24].  Outcomes were 139 \ncommonly reported at distinct points in time - 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months - and 140 \nintervention effects are summarised for these time points.  Where there were results 141 \nreported for different time, these were ascribed to the nearest time point of common 142 \nreporting. 143 \n Intensity of contact varied in intervention arms ranging from one contact every 144 \nfour months [26] to twice weekly [27].  The average contact per month was 4.6 (SD = 145 \n6.5).  High intensity contact interventions tended to be exercise classes. 146 \nBehavioural recommendations. Recommendations regarding dietary intake were 147 \ncategorised using Avenell et al.\u2019s (2004) classifications.  Out of 51 different dietary 148 \ntreatment arms within the included trials, 20 provided general healthy eating advice3\n                                                 \n3 This includes studies where participants could choose their own healthy eating goals. \n, 18 149 \nused a 600 kcal\/day deficit or low fat reducing diet, 9 used a low calorie diet (1000-150 \n 8 \n1600 kcal\/day), two study arms used the Weight Watchers diet4\n PA recommendations varied in intensity, type, duration, frequency, and energy 153 \nexpenditure, and intensity was typically moderate.  Few interventions reported 154 \nrecommending a particular type of activity, with those that did favouring walking and 155 \nregular daily activities.  The recommended activity duration was generally between 30-156 \n45 minutes, three to four times per week.  Some recommendations specified targets for 157 \nenergy expenditure within a given period of time.  Many studies employed supervised 158 \nexercise classes and groups (Table 1).  159 \n, two provided no 151 \ndetails, and one used the Ornish diet2 (Table 1). 152 \nQuality of trials 160 \nRandomisation.  Nineteen trials were identified as having made a good attempt at 161 \nconcealment of randomisation.  The remaining 25 studies stated that allocation was 162 \nrandom without giving descriptions of procedures. 163 \nDescription of withdrawals.  Twenty-one studies provided numbers and reasons for 164 \nstudy participant dropout and 20 studies mentioned the numbers of withdrawals only.  165 \nThree studies stated withdrawals only but did not provide further details. 166 \nIntention to treat.  Twenty-five studies claimed to use intention-to-treat (ITT) data 167 \nanalysis, and 13 studies did not state ITT procedures.  In six studies descriptions 168 \nremained ambiguous. 169 \nBlinding of outcome assessors.  The majority of trials (n=32) did not report blinding of 170 \noutcome assessors.  Three studies stated that assessors were blinded, but did not provide 171 \nfurther detail.  Nine studies that stated blinding assessors and described the blinding 172 \nprocedures. 173 \nBehaviour change 174 \n------------------------------Table 2------------------------------- 175 \nDiet and PA Interventions vs. Usual Care\/Waiting List Control.  Fifteen studies [21, 24, 176 \n26-32, 36, 39-41, 45, 46] reported kilocalorie intake which allowed for meta-analysis at 177 \n3, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months (Table 3).  Reported decreases in favour of intervention 178 \ncompared with control groups were found at all time points and significant MDs were 179 \ndetected at 12, 18 and 36 months.  Evidence of heterogeneity in trial effects (i.e. 180 \ndifferences in outcomes) was detected at 3 (I2 =46.6%) and 6 (I2 = 65.4%) months.  181 \nMost studies reported outcomes at 6 and 12 months.  Three out of 8 studies [30, 45, 46] 182 \n                                                 \n4 It was felt that Weight Watchers and Ornish diets did not fit within the Avenell et al. (2004) categories. \n 9 \nreported significant differences in kilocalorie intake between intervention and control 183 \ngroups at 6 months, and 3 out of 10 studies [21, 24, 45] at 12 months. 184 \nEighteen studies [21-24, 26-32, 35, 39-41, 43, 45, 46] reported enough detail on 185 \nfat intake to allow meta-analysis at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months (Table 3).  Consistent 186 \ndecreases in fat intake in intervention compared with control groups with significant 187 \nSMDs at 3, 12, 18 and 24 months respectively.  Heterogeneity was found at 3, 6, 12 and 188 \n24 months (I2 59.9% \u2013 93.1%).  Most studies reported outcomes at 6 and 12 months 189 \nwith 7 [21, 30, 35, 40, 43, 45, 46] out of 13 studies and 5 [22, 24, 27, 29, 40] out of 17 190 \nstudies reporting significant between-group changes respectively.  At 12 months one 191 \nstudy found a significant decrease in fat intake in the control group compared with the 192 \nintervention condition [35]. 193 \nEighteen studies [16, 22, 24, 26-31, 33-36, 38-40, 45, 46] reported PA outcomes 194 \nin enough detail to allow meta-analysis at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months (Table 3).  195 \nPositive SMDs were reported at all points in time with significant PA increases between 196 \nintervention compared with controls at 3, 6 and 12 months.  Heterogeneity of trial 197 \neffects was found at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months (I2 54.8 \u2013 73%).  The majority of studies 198 \nreported outcomes at 6 and 12 months with 7 [16, 30, 35, 39, 40, 43, 45] out of 12 199 \nstudies, and 6 [27, 31, 36, 39, 40, 45] out of 10 studies respectively  inducing significant 200 \nbetween-group PA differences.  201 \nDietary Interventions vs. Waiting List Control\/Usual Care.  Four studies [17, 18, 32, 202 \n45] reported dietary outcomes which could be included in meta-analysis at 3, 6, 12 and 203 \n24 months (Table 3).  Significant decreases in kilocalorie intake between intervention 204 \nand control groups were detected at 6, 12 and 24 months.  Despite significant changes 205 \nin pooled outcomes at 12 months, only one study out of four [45] found a significant 206 \nbetween-group difference in kilocalorie intake. 207 \n Changes in fat intake were reported in enough detail by three studies [18, 45, 47] 208 \nto allow meta-analysis at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months (Table 3).  Significant intervention 209 \neffects could be detected at 12 and 24.  Heterogeneity was detected at 6 (I2 = 76.1%) 210 \nand 12 (I2 = 53.9%) months.  Significant between-group changes in fat intake were 211 \nreported for all studies except one at 3 months [47] and one at 12 months [45] 212 \nrespectively. 213 \nPA Interventions vs. Waiting List Control\/Usual Care.  Seven studies [15, 20, 30, 45, 214 \n50-52] reported PA change outcomes that allowed meta-analysis at 3, 6, 12 and 24 215 \nmonths. Significant SMDs were found at 6 and 12 months.  At most time points 216 \n 10 \nsignificant differences between intervention and control groups were reported with 2 217 \n[15, 52] out of 2 showing significant between-group PA differences at 3 months, and 3 218 \n[30, 45, 51] out of 5 at 6 months, and 2 [20, 45] out of 3 at 12 months.  219 \nIntensive vs. Less Intensive Interventions.  Three studies [19, 47, 58] allowed the 220 \ninvestigation of an intensive against a less intensive D-only intervention.  Meta-analysis 221 \nat 3 and 12 months revealed no significant changes in kilocalorie intake in the one study 222 \nincluding two samples providing enough details at those time points [19].  A significant 223 \nbetween-group difference in favour of the intensive intervention was reported in one of 224 \nthe two samples.  Changes in fat intake were reported to differ significantly in one study 225 \nconsisting of two samples [19].  A further study of an intense dietary intervention 226 \ncompared with a less intense one found no effects of changes in fat intake at 3 and 6 227 \nmonths [47]. 228 \n Ten studies [25, 32, 36, 45, 46, 53-56, 58] allowed the investigation of an 229 \nintensive against a less intensive D-PA intervention.  None of these studies reported 230 \nsignificant differences between groups for kilocalorie intake at any point in time.  231 \nFurthermore, only one intervention significantly changed fat intake at 6 and 18 months 232 \n[46], and one intervention significantly changed PA at 3 months [58] in favour of the 233 \nintensive intervention.   234 \nWeight change 235 \n------------------------------Table 3 ------------------------------- 236 \n------------------------------Figure 2------------------------------- 237 \nDiet and PA Interventions vs. Waiting List Control\/Usual Care.  Twenty-five  238 \n[16, 21, 22, 24, 26-46] studies reported weight outcomes in sufficient detail to allow 239 \nmeta-analysis at 3, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months (Table 2).  At all time points weight 240 \nchanges were significantly different between intervention and control groups with the 241 \nexception of 18 months.  Effects at all points in time were heterogeneous (I2 = 68.3\u2013242 \n95.0%) with the exception of 24 months (Figure 2).  Most studies reported outcomes at 243 \n6 and 12 months with 10 [21, 28, 30, 32, 35, 40, 42, 43, 45, 46] out of 15 at 6 months 244 \nand 8 [21, 24, 26, 27, 29, 32, 40, 45] out of 15 studies reporting significant between 245 \ngroup differences in weight respectively.   246 \nDiet Interventions vs. Waiting List Control\/Usual Care.  Six studies [18, 32, 45, 47-49] 247 \nreported changes in weight allowing meta-analysis at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months (Table 2).  248 \nDifferences in weight loss between intervention and control groups were significant at 249 \n 11 \n3, 6, and 12 months (Figure 2).  Heterogeneity in the data was found at 3, 6, and 12 250 \nmonths (I2 = 71.9% - 84.8%). 251 \nPA Interventions vs. Waiting List Control\/Usual Care.  Seven studies [15, 20, 30, 45, 252 \n50-52] reported weight outcomes that could be meta-analysed at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months 253 \n(Table 2).  The MD for weight change was significant only at six months with evidence 254 \nfor heterogeneity in the data (I2 = 83.5%).  Few studies reported non-significant 255 \ndifferences at 3, 12 and 24 months (Figure 2). 256 \nIntensive vs. Less Intensive Interventions.  Eleven studies allowed comparisons between 257 \nintensive and less intensive interventions [19, 25, 32, 36, 46, 47, 53-57] at various 258 \npoints in time.  Intensive interventions, irrespective of whether the intervention 259 \nconsisted of a D-only or D-PA intervention, tended to induce greater MD for weight 260 \nthan the less intensive intervention groups (Table 2).  Significant changes were noted at 261 \n12 and 16 months for D-only and at 3 months for D-PA studies.  262 \nRisk factor change 263 \n------------------------------Table 5------------------------------- 264 \n------------------------------Table 6------------------------------- 265 \n------------------------------Table 7------------------------------- 266 \nDiet and PA Interventions vs. Waiting List Control\/Usual Care.  Twenty studies [21, 267 \n24, 26-33, 35-40, 42, 43, 45, 46] reported outcomes with respect to changes in at least 268 \none risk factor (Table 5).  Most studies provided outcome data at 3, 6, 12 and 24 269 \nmonths.  Risk factor changes generally showed beneficial trends at various points in 270 \ntime.  At 3 months significant changes were found in total cholesterol, triglycerides and 271 \nSBP.  At 6 months DBP, SBP and FBG showed significant improvements, with both 272 \nSBP and DBP also showing significant differences between intervention and control 273 \ngroups at 12, 24 and 36 months.  Furthermore, triglycerides as well as HbA1c showed 274 \nimprovements at 12 months.  At 18 months LDL cholesterol was found to be 275 \nsignificantly different in only one study [46] and at 24 months the only measure that 276 \nwas significantly improved was triglycerides.  The only study reporting outcomes at 36 277 \nmonths displayed significant HbA1c improvement [24].  Overall, significant 278 \nimprovements were found in all risk factors with the exception of HDL cholesterol.  279 \nThe most consistent improvements were found in SBP and triglycerides.  280 \nDiet Interventions vs. Waiting List Control\/Usual Care.  Five studies [18, 32, 45, 47, 281 \n49] provided data for at least one risk factor, which could be analysed at 3, 6, 12 and 24 282 \nmonths (Table 6).  Risk factors generally showed tendencies towards improvement.  At 283 \n 12 \n3 months significant improvements occurred in total cholesterol, triglycerides and SBP.  284 \nSBP, DBP and FBG showed no significant differences compared with controls at 6 285 \nmonths (Table 6).   286 \nPA Interventions vs. Waiting List Control\/Usual Care.  Six studies [15, 20, 30, 45, 51, 287 \n52]  reported risk factor outcomes at least once allowing meta-analysis at 3, 6, 12, and 288 \n24 months (Table 7).  Changes in risk factors due to PA-only interventions were less 289 \nconsistent when compared with D-PA and D-only interventions and no significant 290 \neffects could be detected. 291 \nEffects of Intensive vs. Less Intensive Interventions.  Comparison of intensive and less 292 \nintensive interventions found a lack of significant differences with regard to risk factors. 293 \nDISCUSSION 294 \nThe current systematic review assessed intervention effects on behaviour, as well as 295 \nweight and disease risk factors.  When interpreting the results obtained in this review 296 \nshortcomings should be taken into account.  Short-term outcomes (3 months) as well as 297 \nlong-term outcomes (24 months onwards) are based on a limited number of studies. 298 \nDietary and PA behaviours were reported using a variety of different measurements.  In 299 \nparticular, difficulties with self-reported outcomes and unreliable measures have been 300 \nhighlighted in the literature before [8, 59] and might have had an impact on the current 301 \nfindings.  Analyses of D-only, PA-only, and intensive vs. less intensive interventions 302 \nwere somewhat limited due to small number of studies which met inclusion criteria.  It 303 \nshould also be considered that some of our measures for heterogeneity were based on 304 \nfew primary studies and this can reduce the clinical relevance of findings.  The 305 \nmethodological quality of some of the studies that met inclusion criteria displayed room 306 \nfor improvement judged by study reportage.  The majority of studies did not to report 307 \non features such as the method of randomisation, or reasons for participant dropout.  308 \nNearly half of the studies failed to report whether the analysis was intention-to-treat.  309 \nBlinding of outcome assessors was rarely described.  310 \nWe were unable to determine which manipulations were the active and 311 \nsuccessful ingredients within the studies [60].  We grouped the studies by their 312 \nbehavioural targets but this does not specify how interventions successfully change 313 \nthese behaviours and why some interventions were more effective than others [61].  314 \nMore research is needed to determine which specific aspects of behavioural 315 \ninterventions facilitate significant change in behaviour and subsequent physiological 316 \n 13 \noutcomes, thereby explaining some of the significant heterogeneity typically 317 \nencountered in systematic review of behaviour interventions, including the current one.  318 \nThe underlying model on the effect of behaviour change interventions postulates 319 \nthat weight, disease risk factors and health are all influenced through mediating 320 \nbehavioural effects [62].  To our knowledge this review is the first one to include 321 \nbehavioural dietary and PA effects alongside weight and risk factor changes in obese 322 \nadults carrying additional risk factors.  Results indicated that behavioural interventions 323 \nare successful at significantly changing behavioural outcomes to moderate degrees in 324 \nboth dietary and PA behaviours over consistent periods of time.  The magnitude of 325 \nbehavioural effects was modest.  The greatest reported reductions in MD of kilocalorie 326 \nintake for D-PA interventions and D-only interventions were -138 kcal and -360 kcal at 327 \n12 and 6 months respectively.  Given that a common aim of many dietary 328 \nrecommendations is the reduction of kilocalorie intake by 600 kilocalories per day, the 329 \nobserved changes suggest that many participants struggeled to adhere to dietary 330 \nprescriptions.  Similar findings apply to modest dietary fat outcome effect sizes.  A 331 \nprevious systematic review in overweight\/obese individuals without additional risk 332 \nfactors found similarly modest significant effects of dietary advice on fibre, fat and 333 \nsaturated fat intakes [8].  334 \nAn interesting pattern emerges when comparing the magnitude of behavioural 335 \nintervention effects across different types of studies.  Compared against respective 336 \ncontrol conditions, behavioural D-PA study effects tended to be greater in magnitude in 337 \nstudies aimed at changing either of the behaviours in isolation when compared with 338 \nstudies that focused on diet and PA at the same time.  This finding suggests that 339 \nbehaviour change effects are greater when focusing on only one kind of behaviour, as 340 \ncompared with both diet and PA behaviours at the same time.  However, studies 341 \nfocusing on dietary and PA behaviours simultaneously lead to greater long-term weight 342 \nloss than D-only or PA-only studies.  It might be the case that changing two behaviours 343 \nat the same time decreases the magnitude of change due to participants\u2019 limited self-344 \nregulatory resources [63].  However, longer-term behaviour change maintenance might 345 \nbe upheld through focussing the attention and direction of behaviour change on both 346 \nbehaviours that facilitate weight loss.  Using dietary and PA interventions encourage a 347 \ncoherent change in one\u2019s lifestyle behaviours towards behaving healthily. 348 \nObtained weight loss findings are consistent with previous systematic reviews 349 \n[3, 12].  All types of studies successfully produced some weight loss in intervention 350 \n 14 \ncompared with control groups.  Weight loss patterns over time in D-PA, D-only and 351 \nPA-only studies appeared to be similar.  Greatest weight loss was found at six months, 352 \nwith weight regain thereafter, echoing previous systematic review evidence [3] and 353 \nunderlining the difficulty of permanent lifestyle change [64] in obese adults with 354 \nadditional risk factors. 355 \nThe magnitude of weight loss appeared to differ between intervention types. 356 \nInitial weight loss was greatest for D-only interventions, PA-only interventions showed 357 \nthe weakest effects on weight, with the only significant effects found at 6 months.  358 \nDespite superior weight loss at 6 months by D-only interventions, subsequent time 359 \npoints showed weight loss advantages in favour of a combination of diet and PA 360 \ninterventions.  After 12 months the only study type found to produce significant 361 \ndifferences in weight loss were interventions targeting changes in diet and PA.  362 \nDifferences in magnitude of weight loss over time between interventions have 363 \nbeen documented by previous research.  Avenell et al (2004) found that interventions 364 \nfocusing on D-only led to greater MD in weight loss at 12 months compared with 365 \nstudies that focused on both diet and PA, with a reverse of this trend at later time points.  366 \nFurthermore, a systematic review of RCTs of PA interventions found that the union of 367 \nPA with dietary interventions led to a significant increase in weight loss compared with 368 \nD-only interventions [65].  Previous literature has also indicated that PA-only typically 369 \nhas not been significantly more effective than D-only interventions in short-term weight 370 \nloss [66].  These findings point to the importance of PA in the maintenance of initial, 371 \ndietary induced weight loss [64, 67].  Studies using more intensive interventions 372 \nproduced greater weight loss.  This is the case for D-PA, as well as for D-only 373 \ninterventions. 374 \nComparing the magnitude of weight lost in the current review to other published 375 \nmeta-analyses with most trials not recruiting individuals carrying additional risk factors 376 \n[3, 12, 68, 68], it appears that the weight lost in our studies is less.  This difference in 377 \nthe magnitude of weight loss according to the criteria of additional risk factors holds 378 \ntrue for D-only interventions [12], PA-only interventions [65] and intensive compared 379 \nwith less intensive interventions [69]. 380 \nWith regard to changes in disease risk factors, these displayed similar patterns to 381 \nweight loss outcomes.  All types of interventions that could be compared with control 382 \ngroups demonstrated a tendency towards improving various risk factors at some point in 383 \ntime.  However, the types of risk factors affected, as well as the magnitude and 384 \n 15 \nconsistency of risk factor change, tended to differ according to intervention type.  D-385 \nonly interventions induced significant changes in total cholesterol, triglycerides, blood 386 \npressure and FPG in intervention compared with control conditions.  Overall, changes 387 \ntended to occur at 3 and 6 months, mirroring weight loss.  Triglycerides seemed to show 388 \nconsistent beneficial trends at all points in time.  Similarly, total and LDL cholesterol 389 \nshowed trends towards significant improvements at all time points for D-only 390 \ninterventions.  In comparison, PA-only interventions and intensive compared with less 391 \nintensive interventions were not successful at inducing risk factor changes.   392 \nThe greatest changes in risk factors were achieved by interventions that targeted 393 \nboth diet and PA. These changes tended to peak in magnitude at 12 months.  Similar to 394 \nD-only interventions, triglycerides tended to show consistent positive improvements in 395 \ncombination interventions.  Furthermore, blood pressure seemed to show consistent and 396 \nmostly significant improvements over time.  Unlike D-only interventions, the 397 \ncombination of diet and PA induced significant improvements in HbA1c. 398 \nCONCLUSION 399 \nOverall, the findings of this systematic review extend the evidence of behaviour change 400 \nintervention effectiveness [8, 12, 70] and confirm the usefulness of this approach in 401 \npopulations carrying additional risk factors.  Improvements in behaviour , weight, and 402 \ndisease risk factors were recorded for all types of reviewed behaviour change 403 \ninterventions.  Changes tended to be greatest at around 6 months.  Behavioural changes 404 \nwere modest and tended to be greater in studies focusing solely on a single behaviour 405 \nrather than both.  Interventions focusing on diet and PA simultaneously showed the 406 \ngreatest improvements in terms of weight loss and disease risk factor change.  However, 407 \nmost consistent beneficial effects over time regarding behaviourn weight and disease 408 \nrisk factors were found in D-PA studies.  The current review suggests that behavioural 409 \ninterventions in at risk populations showed positive effect tendencies.  Future research 410 \nshould focus on identifying the most effective means of inducing dietary and PA 411 \nbehaviour change.  412 \n 413 \nConflict of Interest statement 414 \nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.415 \n 16 \nReferences \n1.
