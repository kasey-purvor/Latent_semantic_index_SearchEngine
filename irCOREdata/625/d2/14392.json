There would appear to be widespread concern that\nthe fundamental principles of creating accessible web-based materials seem at odds with the creative\nand innovative use of multimedia to support learning and teaching, as well as concerns over the time\nand cost of providing accessibility features that can hold back resource development and application.\nYet, effective use of multimedia offers a way of enhancing the accessibility of the learning environ-\nment for many groups of disabled students. Using the development of \u2018Skills for Access\u2019, a web\nresource supporting the dual aims of creating optimally accessible multimedia for learning, as an\nexample, the attitudinal, practical and technical challenges facing the effective use of multimedia as\nan accessibility aid in a learning environment will be explored. Reasons why a holistic approach to\naccessibility may be the most effective in ensuring that multimedia reaches its full potential in\nenabling and supporting students in learning, regardless of any disability they may have, will be\noutlined and discussed.\nIntroduction\nMultimedia in e-learning offers significant potential in enhancing the learning\nenvironment, through helping to widen access to education, enhancing the learning\nexperience and supporting multiple learning styles (Thornhill et al., 2002; Littlejohn,\n2003). As availability, capability and affordability of technology (hardware and\n*Corresponding author. Digital Media Access Group, Division of Applied Computing, University\nof Dundee, Dundee DD1 4HN, UK. Email: dsloan@computing.dundee.ac.uk\n40 D. Sloan et al.\nsoftware) improves, teachers have increased opportunity to create and use multime-\ndia in curriculum design. For example, video and audio recordings and photographs\ncould be used to capture and convey real-world experiences and events, whether from\nthe past or in real time. Animated interactive diagrams could be used to demonstrate\nand simulate concepts in many different disciplines, allowing students to study effects\nover time or as the result of changing specific parameters.\nFor disabled students, multimedia can offer the potential to significantly improve\nthe accessibility of the learning environment and, indeed, extending the learning\nenvironment to otherwise inaccessible places; for example, using video to enhance the\naccessibility of field-trip environments to students with physical disabilities. At the\nsame time, poorly designed or inappropriate use of multimedia could effectively\nexclude a disabled student from a learning programme. Given the legal imperatives\nof the UK\u2019s Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) in the United Kingdom (HMSO,\n1995), extended in 2001 to cover the provision of post-16 education, and of similar\nlegislation in many countries around the world, educational establishments and their\nstaff have increased responsibility to ensure that unjustified discrimination in not\nexperienced by disabled students.\nConsequently, there is significant activity in the e-learning community towards\nensuring that accessibility to disabled people is a key consideration in the develop-\nment of educational online resources (Seale, 2004), particularly those intended for\nreuse for different purposes in different environments (Brewer & Treviranus, 2003).\nGuidelines for the creation of accessible e-learning resources (IMS Global\nLearning Consortium, 2002) offer accessibility advice in the context of creating\nresources for learning and teaching. The ongoing IMS AccessForAll work, involving\nthe Accessibility for Learner Information Package Specification (IMS ACCLIP) and\nAccessForAll Metadata Specification, (both available from the IMS website1)\ntogether provide a framework for storing a learner\u2019s specific accessibility preferences\nand a structured way of describing a resource\u2019s specific accessibility characteristics,\nthe degree to which it may be customised to enhance its accessibility while preserving\npedagogic aim and any equivalent alternatives.\nMaking multimedia optimally accessible\nThe broadcasting sector has for some time been taking steps to address issues relating\nto accessibility of broadcast television services, to the extent that key accessibility\ntechniques developed in \u2018traditional\u2019 broadcasting have been adapted for multimedia\nweb content (Clark, 2002; Carey, 2005a). In the United Kingdom, the Independent\nTelevision Commission (ITC) produced guidance for the provision of accessibility\nfeatures for broadcast television, and commissioned research exploring issues relating\nto the accessibility of interactive digital television provision, with a specific focus on\nthe issues faced by older people (Carmichael, 1999). Ofcom, the ITC\u2019s regulatory\nsuccessor from 2003, assumed the role of promoting accessibility in UK broadcast-\ning, and publishes online the ITC guidance on various aspects of access features for\ntelevision, as well as setting quotas of accessible programming for broadcasters to\nMultimedia enhancing accessibility of learning for disabled students 41\nmeet (Ofcom, undated). Despite this, concerns have been expressed that accessibility\nhas not as yet played a suitably important role in the rollout of digital television\nservices in the United Kingdom (Carmichael et al., 2005).\nOn the Web, content and e-learning developers concerned about the accessibility\nof their resources to disabled students can look to the Web Content Accessibility\nGuidelines (WCAG) (Web Accessibility Initiative [WAI], 1999) for advice and\nsupport. The WCAG, produced by the WAI of the World Wide Web Consortium\n(W3C) are the de facto standard for accessibility of web content, providing a solid\nfoundation on which to build a working knowledge of accessible web design\ntechniques. They also offer a framework on which website evaluation methodologies\nand automated accessibility checking tools can be based, and a reference for policy-\nmakers and benchmarking exercises.\nVersion 1.0 of the WCAG overwhelmingly concentrates on HTML-delivered\ncontent, and only three of the 65 checkpoints appear to refer directly to multime-\ndia. One such checkpoint includes multimedia within a wider list of webpage\nelements: \nProvide a text equivalent for every non-text element [\u2026] This includes: images [\u2026] anima-\ntions (e.g., animated GIFs), applets and programmatic objects [\u2026] sounds (played with\nor without user interaction), stand-alone audio files, audio tracks of video, and video.\n(Checkpoint 1.1)\nTwo WCAG checkpoints specifically address the use of multimedia: \nUntil user agents can automatically read aloud the text equivalent of a visual track, provide\nan auditory description of the important information of the visual track of a multimedia\npresentation. (Checkpoint 1.3)\nFor any time-based multimedia presentation (e.g., a movie or animation), synchronize\nequivalent alternatives (e.g., captions or auditory descriptions of the visual track) with the\npresentation. (Checkpoint 1.4)\nIn each checkpoint, the basic premise is that text and\/or audio alternatives must be\nprovided for the multimedia content. Expanding on these two WCAG checkpoints\nlisted, the two key accessibility features required for optimally accessible multimedia\nare (Clark, 2002): \n1. Synchronised text captions, providing spoken and key non-spoken sound infor-\nmation in text, for people who are deaf or hearing impaired.\n2. Audio descriptions\u2014audio files synchronised with the main soundtrack of the\nmedia clip. These allow people who cannot see the clip to understand its content\nthrough the provision of spoken descriptions of key visual events that would not\nbe discernible from the main soundtrack alone.\nIf these features cannot be provided, a more basic requirement is to provide a text\ntranscript of the media clip, in HTML format, clearly linked from the page containing\nthe media clip in question. The disadvantage of this solution is that, by its nature, it\nis an alternative to the media clip, rather than an integrated, synchronised solution as\nwith captions and audio descriptions.\n42 D. Sloan et al.\nSynchronised signed translations of spoken content are also a highly desirable\naccessibility feature, serving the requirements of people whose primary language is a\nsign language\u2014and who may have extreme difficulty reading on-screen text. This is\ncurrently a particularly rare accessibility solution in practice, given the work required\nto produce and publish a synchronised signed translation. However, ongoing efforts\nhave attempted to develop an automated animated signed translation facility, through\nan avatar; for example, the VisiCast project (Elliot et al., 2000).\nAn additional accessibility feature often required is subtitles, a textual translation\nof the spoken content of the media clip into the language of the viewing population.\nThis accessibility solution caters for a cognitive disability, that of being unable to\nunderstand the spoken content despite being able to hear it. Yet, in the United\nKingdom and Ireland, the term \u2018subtitles\u2019 is widely, but confusingly, used to refer not\njust to foreign-language translation but also to captions for people unable to hear the\nsoundtrack (see, for example, the list of accessibility solutions in Carey [2005a]).\nOther accessibility requirements for multimedia include the need to ensure that\noperation is keyboard accessible, to allow people who for reasons of visual or mobility\nimpairment have difficulty in using, or are unable to use, a mouse. For video and\naudio, this includes basic operations of play, pause, stop, fast-forward and rewind,\ncontrolling display and audio properties, and enabling or adjusting accessibility\nfeatures such as captioning and audio description.\nInteractive animated content such as Macromedia Flash may present similar\nproblems if its operation requires fine mouse control. For animated content to be\noptimally accessible to people who cannot see the animation, there is also a need\nto ensure that the experiences and information provided by the animation are\navailable in audio format, either by exposing the content to allow a screen reader\nto read it out, or through audio soundtrack(s) provided with the animation\n(Regan, 2002).\nMultimedia as an assistive technology\nFor many Web users, accessibility problems result not from the absence of an alter-\nnative to information requiring a specific sensory capability or level of manual dexter-\nity, but from the inability to process and understand the information presented on\nscreen. Overwhelmingly this problem is due to the presentation, style and content of\non-screen text (Seeman, 2002). People with dyslexia, with concentration difficulties,\nwith reduced short-term memory or with other specific learning difficulties may all\nstruggle with textual information. Similarly problems may be encountered for people\nfor whom English is not their first language (Vanderheiden, 2000). For all these\ngroups, arguably the most inaccessible way of presenting information is through a\nlong page of on-screen text. It follows that presenting information in alternative\nways\u2014pictures, diagrams, animated diagrams, video clips, audio recordings\u2014is far\nmore effective in conveying information and experiences, and hence supporting\ncomprehension and retention of information. Multimedia thus becomes an accessi-\nbility solution, an assistive technology.\nMultimedia enhancing accessibility of learning for disabled students 43\nHowever, for multimedia development, the wider potential of multimedia as an\nenabler, as a way of making information more accessible to certain groups of disabled\npeople, is not immediately obvious from an inspection of the WCAG. The only\nindication offered of this potential offered is found in WCAG checkpoint 14.2: \nSupplement text with graphic or auditory presentations where they will facilitate compre-\nhension of the page.\nIt would seem reasonable to infer from this checkpoint, however, that the use of\nmultimedia to enhance comprehension of information, experiences or concepts\npresented as online text is indeed an important step towards accessibility. Slatin\nand Rush (2002) make this very point in their book Maximum Accessibility, noting\nthat: \nIn some cases, the best way to enhanced accessibility may be to use more media \u2026 used\nin the right way, multimedia is a critical resource for accessibility!\nThe key phrase in this quotation is \u2018used in the right way\u2019. There is still a need to\nensure that every reasonable effort is taken to ensure that the information and,\nperhaps more significantly, experience provided by the media clip in question is as\naccessible as possible to as many as possible of the intended audience.\nChallenges to the provision of accessible multimedia\nDespite the arguments promoting multimedia as a positive contributor to enhancing\nthe accessibility of the e-learning environment, there are many challenges to be over-\ncome before multimedia can reach its potential as an enabler for disabled students.\nAttitudinal\nThe relative prominence of accessible web design requirements for ensuring content\ncan be accessed by people with visual impairments has contributed to the inaccurate\nperception that all principles of web accessibility can be summarised as \u2018provide all\ninformation in text format\u2019\u2014a position that may be further distorted to imply that\ngraphics and colour, let alone video, audio and interactive animated media, is\nprohibited on account of accessibility. The argument that accessible web content is\nincompatible with visually pleasing, engaging online experiences has been confi-\ndently met by assertions that highly accessible sites can indeed maintain a high\ndegree of visually stimulating content (Zeldman, 2003; Petrie et al., 2004). However,\nthe message that multimedia is an important contributor to accessibility for some\ngroups may unfortunately be lost among the more prominent and apparently higher\npriority demands for multimedia to be provided with accessibility features to over-\ncome sensory impairments.\nThe WAI classed the aforementioned checkpoint 14.2 on supplementing text with\ngraphics or audio as a Priority Three WCAG checkpoint, the lowest of the three\npriority levels allocated to each checkpoint. This arguably recognises that the task of\n44 D. Sloan et al.\n\u2018supplementing text\u2019 with multimedia is likely to require a reasonable degree of\nproduction skill and resources, beyond the capacity of many web authors who would\nbe most comfortable providing text, and possibly simple graphics. At the same time\nit may be interpreted as playing down the positive impact on accessibility of the\njudicious use of multimedia. The result may be at best a failure to acknowledge the\nrole multimedia content can play in enhancing the accessibility of the information or\nexperience provided by a resource. For example, in an accessibility review of the\nBBCi website (Robertson et al., 2002), no mention was made of the positive accessi-\nbility role that the multimedia present on the site could offer. At worst, there could\nbe a rejection or withdrawal of potentially valuable multimedia content that, as well\nas potentially enhancing the learning environment more generally, offers specific\naccessibility benefits for other groups, particularly people with specific learning\ndifficulties (Seeman, 2002).\nFor multimedia producers and designers, this issue may adversely affect their\nperceptions of accessibility, given that the strongest message is \u2018provide alternatives\u2019\nrather than \u2018use multimedia\u2019. The authors have had personal experience of producers\nwho, when confronted with the issue of accessibility and potentially discriminatory\nresources, have experienced a range of emotions: \n\u25cf Defensiveness or hostility, as they perceive that their previously well-regarded work\nis coming under attack for being discriminatory.\n\u25cf Embarrassment, as they realise that their work may exclude certain students from\naccessing it.\n\u25cf Fear, and helplessness, as they are told that their work must be \u2018made accessible\u2019\nor face the consequences of legal action, without necessarily having the skills or\nsupport to make the necessary changes within current work schedules and budgets.\n\u25cf De-motivation, as they perceive that their work is no longer \u2018legal\u2019, as it may be\ndiscriminatory, and is therefore no longer of any worth.\nWhile some of these reactions may seem extreme, the adverse impact of designer atti-\ntude to accessibility should not be underestimated.\nA perception also exists among some developers that, when it comes to multimedia,\nproviding accessibility features may be seen as \u2018too expensive\u2019, with no cost benefit.\nThis is consistent with a more general resistance to arguments against inclusive\ndesign, despite examples of commercial success in, for example, vehicle or household\nobject design (Keates & Clarkson, 2004). Carey (2005b) notes that the \u2018too expensive\nand not worth it\u2019 argument has historically been the case with regard to analogue\nbroadcast media. This perception remains, as pointed out in criticism of recent acces-\nsibility guidance issued by Ofcom to UK broadcasters (Carmichael et al., 2005),\ndespite on the one hand the nature of digital media offering vastly improved capacity\nfor bundling accessibility features such as captions, subtitles, audio descriptions and\nsigned translations along with the media clip, and on the other hand in the reusability,\nand hence increased potential audience, of digital media, whether web-based or\nbroadcast media that can be recorded and reused through personal video recorder\ntechnology.\nMultimedia enhancing accessibility of learning for disabled students 45\nPractical\nThere are a number of practical issues relating to effective provision of accessible\nmultimedia. Knowledge and awareness of accessibility issues remains relatively low\namong web and multimedia developers, although the situation has undoubtedly\nimproved in recent years. The time required to implement accessibility features can\nbe significant, and even more so if done retrospectively. At the same time, while\ngeneral principles of accessible multimedia are widely accepted, there is a lack of solid\nresearch-based guidelines in many more specific aspects of accessible multimedia\ndesign.\nTasks such as creating caption files for a pre-existing video clip and synchronising\nthem appropriately with the clip, or creating an accurate transcript of a long audio\nclip, require practical knowledge of the authoring techniques necessary. The more\nsubjective issue of what to include in a caption or audio description file may also make\nthe task more difficult and lengthy than initially realised. Indeed, while guidance such\nas that provided by Ofcom may exist, the lack of examples of captioned online video\nand its implications for best practice is emphasised by Clark (2004), who attempted\nto define best practice on online captioning, but failed to find any training or quality\ncertification programme dedicated to online captioning. Clark notes: \nNearly everyone doing online captioning today is self-taught.\nand: \nWe are aware of no surveys whatsoever of viewer preferences in online captioning.\nGiven this, Clark then suggests that: \n[\u2026] we need to produce a much larger corpus of online captioned video, in order to make\nsolid recommendations for best practices in online captioning.\nWhile evidence-based best practice may be lacking, some encouraging develop-\nments have taken place to ease the practical task of improving the accessibility of\nmultimedia content. The development of tools such as the Media Access Generator\n(MAGpie2) from the US-based National Centre for Accessible Media eases the task\nof authoring and adding synchronised captions and audio description files to digital\nvideo. Improvements to Macromedia\u2019s Flash and Shockwave rich media formats, and\nauthoring tools for creating Flash and Shockwave, have offered greater capacity to\ninclude accessibility features such as keyboard accessibility and enhanced compatibil-\nity with screen reading technology (Regan, 2002). Bennett et al. (2003) describe the\ndevelopment of SMIRK, an authoring tool to facilitate accessible presentation\ncreation with the intention of improving the accessibility of a traditional lecturing\nscenario. Development by the W3C of the Synchronised Multimedia Integration\nLanguage (SMIL) specification (W3C, 2005) creates an open standard for associat-\ning captions and audio description files and their timing information with a media file.\nHowever, on a more abstract scale is the issue of multimedia as an accessibility aid.\nThis concept is difficult to encapsulate in solid guidelines applicable across a range of\nscenarios, and therefore a subjective analysis of the textual information or concept\n46 D. Sloan et al.\nrequiring illustration is required, depending on the pedagogic aim of the e-learning\nresource in question, and its context in the wider learning environment or\nprogramme. A desire for rules and checklists is surprisingly prevalent among media\ndevelopers, illustrated in recent feedback received by the authors after the launch of\nthe Skills for Access website (discussed later). This is unfortunate, given that the most\neffective approach to providing an effective accessibility solution is to consider the\npedagogic aim of the multimedia object and the resource in which it will appear, and\nthe role of the learning object within a wider context, and using this contextual infor-\nmation to guide the most appropriate approach to optimising accessibility.\nEstablishing responsibility for accessibility\nThere is also an issue raised by the situation whereby responsibility for ensuring educa-\ntional multimedia is optimally accessible may not lie with the agency best placed to\nprovide the accessibility features. While it may be common for teachers to develop\ntheir own web-based teaching resources using tools provided by a Virtual Learning\nEnvironment or web authoring tool, much multimedia used in e-learning resources is\nprofessionally produced, either commissioned through institutions\u2019 own production\nunits or external agencies. The increasing interest in reusable learning objects again\nhighlights the situation where the creator of a resource may not be the direct user. The\nmost appropriate and effective place to author and combine accessibility features is at\nthe point of production, but the provision of accessibility features is not commonly\nconsidered a standard part of media production, and may require a specific request\nat the time of commissioning. Some multimedia used in an educational context may\nbe captured or generated live\u2014for example, to facilitate synchronous communication\nbetween remote peers or learners and teachers. Provision of live accessibility features\nsuch as captions may in such situations prove extremely challenging, especially as\nhuman and technical resources are likely to be limited. A significant, and increasing,\namount of digital video and audio material is also made available for \u2018off-the-shelf\u2019\neducational use; for example, in the United Kingdom, through services such as the\nEducational Media Online service hosted by EDINA3 and the British Universities\nFilm and Video Council.4 It is not clear how much of this digital video content has\nbeen provided with captions and audio descriptions, but an optimistic estimate is\nlikely to be an extremely small percentage.\nThus, while the production stage is the most appropriate stage for providing acces-\nsibility features, much of the material made available for use by e-learning developers\nand users may not in fact have the necessary accessibility features, and the providers\nmay be unwilling or unable to provide such features, given the amount of material\nthat would need to be addressed. Yet the legal position is complex, at least with\nrespect to the UK\u2019s DDA (Sloan, 2004), when the relationship between the media\nproducer, the organisation providing access to the media, and the educational estab-\nlishment is considered. It may only be when the material is used by an educational\nestablishment in a way that is discriminatory to a disabled student that legislative\nrequirements come into play. Thus, unless otherwise specified by the educational\nMultimedia enhancing accessibility of learning for disabled students 47\ninstitution, the most immediate legal responsibility appears to fall on the e-learning\ndeveloper or teacher to avoid discriminatory practice, rather than the organisation(s)\nproducing and\/or making available the media resource. A scenario may thus emerge\nwhereby e-learning developers around the country are working independently on\nproviding their own captions for the same uncaptioned video clip obtained from an\nonline digital data archive, although an alternative scenario may be the rejection of\npotentially valuable multimedia content on account of an absence of accessibility\nfeatures. The IMS AccessForAll work is potentially of great significance here in that\nit offers a solid framework for specifying accessibility features and limitations of indi-\nvidual resources, and identifying suitable alternatives where access barriers currently\nexist; for example, where multimedia has been acquired without captions or audio\ndescriptions.\nTechnical\nAside from the practical issues of developing expertise in providing accessibility\nsolutions to multimedia, and the time and resources required to develop the features,\ntechnical challenges may make more difficult the task of creating optimally accessible\nmultimedia for educational purposes. The availability to developers of the appropri-\nate design and evaluation tools necessary to create optimally accessible material is a\ncritical issue, requiring organisations to consider accessibility from a procurement\nperspective.\nWith web-delivered multimedia, there is also the complexity of the accessibility\ncapabilities of multimedia technologies and accessibility support of media players;\nthat is, the software that works with the web browser to play the media file and any\naccessibility feature provided. The W3C has acknowledged the importance of the\nmedia player in ensuring accessibility, along with the web browser, assistive technol-\nogy and other \u2018user agents,\u2019 in developing the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines\n(WAI, 2002).\nSignificant improvements in media player and media format accessibility have\ntaken place, motivated by legislation in the United States (the 1998 amendment to\nSection 508 of the Rehabilitation Act) prohibiting federal organisations from provid-\ning or using technology with specific accessibility barriers. Unfortunately, at the time\nof writing, accessibility issues still exist with each of the main media players used for\ndelivering multimedia online. Media player accessibility issues include limited\nkeyboard accessibility to key functions of the features of the player, particularly when\nthe media player exists as an \u2018embedded\u2019 interface within a webpage, instead of acting\nas a stand-alone player opened through activating a link on the webpage (WebAIM,\nundated). While embedded media integrates the media clip more seamlessly within a\nwebpage, the limitations of keyboard accessibility mean that people who for reasons\nof mobility impairment or visual impairment are unable to use a mouse may have\nextreme difficulty accessing the multimedia content.\nMedia players also have limitations in terms of their support for the accessibility\nfeatures described earlier. For example, accessibility features may exist only as\n48 D. Sloan et al.\n\u2018advanced\u2019 features not available in the free version of the player, the ability to turn\non and off captions is not available in the free version of QuickTime, while at the time\nof writing Windows Media Player cannot support audio description files at all. The\nFlash player, from Macromedia, is the most common means of delivering rich\nanimated content through websites, and is increasingly used as an alternative way of\ndelivering video content without requiring a dedicated media player. Despite the\naforementioned improvements, some accessibility issues remain with the Flash\nplayer, in terms of its support for screen readers and its keyboard accessibility (Heins\n& Regan, 2002). The task of providing and making available accessibility features\nsuch as captions and audio descriptions is made more difficult through the use of one\ntechnology, Flash, to play another, the media clip.\nSkills for Access: supporting media developers and producers\nIn an effort to support developers wishing to create optimally accessible multimedia\ncontent for learning, and aware of the challenges that face developers in achieving this\ngoal, the Skills for Access project was funded by the Higher Education Funding\nCouncil for England and Department of Employment and Learning Northern Ireland\nto create a web resource devoted to multimedia, accessibility and learning (Stone\net al., 2003). Importantly, the project brought together a professional media and\ne-learning production unit (the Learning Development and Media Unit (LDMU) at\nthe University of Sheffield, UK) and accessibility and inclusive design experts (the\nDigital Media Access Group (DMAG) at the University of Dundee, UK). As media\nand e-learning producers, LDMU not only produced media assets for the resource\nbut, as representatives of the intended audience, were involved in specifying require-\nments for the resource, and evaluating its appropriateness. The expert advice offered\nby DMAG was then effectively \u2018trialled\u2019 internally within the project team during the\nresource development, and practical challenges in following accessibility guidelines\nwere identified and documented as part of the information provided by the resource.\nLaunched in May 2005, the resulting web site5 was designed with accessibility and\nweb standards in mind, and provides advice and support in a number of ways: \n\u25cf The Skills for Access approach to accessibility, learning and multimedia.\nThe dual approach to multimedia accessibility is introduced; that is, teachers and\ne-learning developers are encouraged to use multimedia wherever possible to\nenhance the accessibility of the traditional learning environment, but at the same\ntime to make best efforts to ensure the multimedia resource\u2014or more specifically\nthe intended learning outcome of the resource\u2014is as accessible as possible to the\ntarget audience.\n\u25cf How-to guides. These are a series of resources focusing on a specific accessibility\nobjective applied to a particular multimedia technology. Each guide outlines the\nobjective, discusses details of techniques for achieving the objective and suggests\ntesting mechanisms for ensuring the objective have been met. Importantly, each\nHow-to guide also provides links to other relevant web resources that give more\nMultimedia enhancing accessibility of learning for disabled students 49\ninformation on the issue in hand, or provide examples. Topics covered include\ncaptioning and audio description of video, and supporting interaction of animated\ncontent with alternative input devices.\n\u25cf Articles and case studies. A number of short articles focusing on the potential\nof multimedia to enhance accessibility of learning, and teaching, were commis-\nsioned from experts in the field of multimedia, learning and accessibility. Case\nstudies are also provided, some focusing on disabled students and staff sharing\ntheir experiences in using e-learning and multimedia. Other case studies were\nsupplied by media and e-learning developers; who discuss specific projects relating\nto creating accessible multimedia. As a demonstration of how multimedia can be\nused to enhance both the provision of information and the browsing experience,\nseveral of the case studies are video based.\n\u25cf Supporting resources. Supporting resources include background information,\nand links to more detailed resources, on disabilities, multimedia technologies and\nspecific access challenges that might be encountered by a disabled student when\naccessing a learning programme. Also provided are details of the Skills for Access\nwebsite construction, discussing the features of the site and how it supports acces-\nsibility.\nAreas of further development of the site include publishing new case studies, with the\naim of building up a catalogue of experiences that can be used to inform the commu-\nnity through sharing success stories and frustrations alike.\nDeveloping accessible multimedia for learning: lessons from Skills \nfor Access\nMany lessons were learnt along the way during the project. As knowledge of the\nissues, including legislative requirements, grew among the production team, attitudes\nof media producers to accessibility became more favourable. Another revelation was\nthe complexity of the current situation of media players and support for accessibility\nfeatures, and the implications of the work required to implement accessibility\nsolutions. Despite the best efforts to provide information that supported users while\nencouraging them to think more widely about the issues, some initial feedback has\nindicated that there is still a preference for short checklist-style information, even\nthough this may lead to inappropriate solutions being chosen.\nThose involved in the project also experienced first hand the benefit of considering\naccessibility from the beginning of the production process, and maintaining this influ-\nence throughout. The unavoidable additional time required to implement accessibil-\nity solutions, and the need to consider this in scheduling and resourcing projects, was\nalso made clear. This was reflected in LDMU staff feedback and by quotes from two\nseparate case studies published on the Skills for Access website: \nIt seems to us, therefore, that the pivotal question that runs through the whole implemen-\ntation of accessible multimedia issue is time. Where do you find the time to do it all? (Case\nstudy: providing captioned video clips for the Skills for Access website6)\n50 D. Sloan et al.\nThe major factor in achieving (the aims of the captioning exercise) was that of time. The\ninitial transcription of the 7.5 minute video took around 30 minutes. This time could be\ndramatically reduced if even a rough transcript had been available\u2014which emphasises the\npoint that accessibility requirements should be taken into account at the planning stages\n(in this case, before filming) rather than subsequently \u2018retro-fitting\u2019 an inaccessible\nresource. (Case study: captioning with QuickTime SMIL, Patrick Lauke7)\nIt is clear that, for multimedia production, the task of \u2018retrofitting\u2019 existing work to\nbe made optimally accessible is particularly challenging. At the same time, it is easy\nfor developers to apply accessibility solutions inappropriately, creating solutions that\nmay appear to be technically \u2018accessible\u2019, but to fail to provide disabled people with\nthe equivalent intended learning experience, or solutions that dilute the learning\nexperience for other students and do little to benefit the disabled learner. This under-\nlines the importance, from an accessibility perspective, of advance dialogue with the\ncommissioner of any production work, in order that teacher and producer can both\ngain an idea of the pedagogic aims of the resource and its intended role in teaching\nand learning.\nThis approach acknowledges arguments that, given the varying nature of accessi-\nbility requirements among individuals with specific impairment or combination of\nimpairments, combined with the unique aims and context of an online resource (such\nas audience characteristics and usage environment), a guideline-based approach is\nnot sufficient to ensure the most appropriate accessibility solutions are provided\n(Milne et al., 2005). For e-learning accessibility in general, and multimedia in partic-\nular, a holistic approach is advised (Kelly et al., 2004, 2005), acknowledging the role\ne-learning plays in enhancing the wider learning environment.\nThe need for a holistic approach to multimedia accessibility\nIn the United Kingdom, the legislation of the DDA does not specify technical\nrequirements that must be met by digital resources in order to avoid discrimination.\nAccompanying Codes of Practice have been provided to give practical guidance on\nhow unlawful discrimination may be involved\u2014for example, the Code of Practice for\nProviders of Post 16 Education and Related Services (Disability Rights Commission,\n2002), which gives examples of where the DDA might apply in an educational estab-\nlishment, and what might constitute, in the terms of the legislation, \u2018reasonable\nadjustments\u2019 to practice in order to ensure that unjustified discrimination does not\noccur. Yet there is little in the way of prescriptive technical information in terms of e-\nlearning design. This may seem at first glance frustrating to e-learning developers, but\nin fact provides an opportunity to use the most appropriate resources, or combination\nof resources, to create an optimally accessible learning environment. The use of\nmultimedia may therefore be considered a reasonable adjustment to make to the\nprovision of education in order to reduce exclusion.\nTo approach the issue of accessibility in relation to a specific multimedia learning\nresource, there is a need to move beyond a technical definition of the level of acces-\nsibility to be achieved, to a wider context. It is easy to imagine a scenario whereby a\nMultimedia enhancing accessibility of learning for disabled students 51\ndeveloper, given a set of accessibility guidelines, may try to apply inappropriate acces-\nsibility solutions. For example, it would be clearly inappropriate to provide captions\nfor a video used in a modern language class to test students\u2019 ability to listen and\nunderstand spoken dialogue. The Skills for Access resource encourages a holistic\napproach, establishing context by considering the following points: \n\u25cf What are the aims, the pedagogic goals of this piece of multimedia? How does the\nresource fit in with the rest of the learning environment?\n\u25cf Will all students be required to use it? Is its use compulsory for completion of a\ncourse or for assessment?\n\u25cf Where is the resource intended to be used\u2014a controlled environment like a\nlaboratory or classroom, or potentially anywhere? What assumptions can be made\nabout the browsing and access technology available to intended users (and their\nknowledge of that technology)?\n\u25cf What are the potential barriers to using the multimedia resource for its intended\npurpose? What levels of sensory or motor abilities are required? How might specific\nlearning difficulties or other cognitive impairments affect the ability to use the\nresource?\n\u25cf What alternatives already exist and what alternatives can be reasonably created?\nHow was the subject or topic previously taught?\n\u25cf What is the best way that the information or experiences can be presented such\nthat: \n1. As many as possible of the intended audience can achieve the intended\nlearning objectives using the multimedia resource?\n2. Those affected by remaining accessibility barriers can achieve the same objec-\ntives in a way best suited to them?\nThe answers to these questions should help e-learning developers and media produc-\ners establish a sound basis on which to build a strategy for accessible design, and to\nensure that the accessibility solutions chosen are most appropriate for the context in\nwhich the resource will be used. This proactive approach is required by the need of\nthe UK DDA for educational providers to be anticipatory in the steps they take to\naccommodate the needs of future disabled learners, and ultimately promotes a\nculture of accessible design.\nConclusion\nThe judicious use of multimedia in an educational context offers significant potential\nin making the learning environment more accessible to disabled students, although\nthis message can be lost in favour of the equally important, but higher-profile,\ndemands that multimedia be provided with additional features to make it accessible.\nWhile resources supporting designers improve in quality and quantity, there is still\nscope for improvement in the support for accessibility of the tools and technologies\navailable to developers and end users to ensure that using online multimedia is as\neasy as possible regardless of personal access needs. Additionally, given that some\n52 D. Sloan et al.\naccessibility features do require extra time to implement, production schedules need\nto consider this from the start, while a more joined-up approach to the provision of\naccessible multimedia across the wider educational community is also needed.\nThe need for a holistic approach to multimedia e-learning is clear. E-learning\nresource developers, multimedia producers and teachers must work together to estab-\nlish the context of a multimedia resource in order to assess: \n\u25cf How best the resource in question can enhance the accessibility of the learning\nenvironment.\n\u25cf How to ensure the resource\u2014and the learning experience it provides\u2014is itself is as\naccessible as possible to the target audience.\nAcknowledgements\nThanks to LDMU staff Steve Collier, Claire Allam, Graham McElearney, Chris\nFirth, Katrin Thomson and Karen Waddicor for their input, and to the reviewers of\nthis paper for their comments.\nNotes\n1. http:\/\/www.imsglobal.org\/accessibility\/\n2. http:\/\/ncam.wgbh.org\/webaccess\/magpie\/\n3. http:\/\/www.edina.ac.uk\n4. http:\/\/www.bufvc.ac.uk\n5. http:\/\/www.skillsforaccess.org.uk\n6. http:\/\/www.skillsforaccess.org.uk\/casestudies.php?id=157\n7. http:\/\/www.skillsforaccess.org.uk\/casestudies.php?id=162\nReferences\nBennett, S., Hewitt, J., Kraithman, D. & Britton, C.
