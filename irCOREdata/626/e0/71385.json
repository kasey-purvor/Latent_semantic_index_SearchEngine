In these languages word order constraints are used to make syntactic\nslots identifiable on the basis of their position within the clause or phrase. Hence the\nword order possibilities are rather restricted in these languages. Counterexamples to\nthe latter claim all involve cases in which identifiability is ensured by morphological\nrather than syntactic means. This shows that there is a balanced trade-off between the\nsyntactic, morphological, and lexical structure of a language.\n1.

We thus aim at sup-\nplementing the insights provided by syntactic and morphological typology\nwith those provided by lexical typology.3\nThe paper is organized as follows: section 2 presents the language sample\non which the research is based. In section 3 we summarize the classification\nof parts-of-speech systems presented in Hengeveld (1992a) and show how the\nsample languages fit into this classification. Our definitions of the relevant\nword order parameters and the classification of the sample languages in\nterms of these parameters are given in section 4. After these preliminary\nsections, we are in a position to formulate, in section 5, a number of hy-\npotheses concerning the correlations between parts-of-speech systems and\nword order properties, which we then systematically test on the languages of\nthe sample. The discussion of our results in section 6 concentrates on the\nquestion how our results throw new light on various findings in the earlier\ntypological literature on word order. More specifically, we claim that a\nnumber of well-known word order correlations can be restricted to sets of\nlanguages sharing the same parts-of-speech system.\n2. TH E S A M P L E\nThe sample on which the research is based is given in table 1. The languages\nlisted there have been selected in such a way that the sample represents the\nhighest possible degree of genetic, geographic and typological diversity.\nIn order to meet the genetic criterion, the languages in the sample were\nselected using the method presented in Rijkhoff et al. (1993). This method\naims at creating maximal genetic diversity in the sample and \u2013 in this\ncase \u2013 has been applied to Ruhlen\u2019s (1991)4 classification of the world\u2019s\n[2] For example, in Chomsky\u2019s Minimalist program (Chomsky 1995), which concentrates on\ninvariant (\u2018narrow\u2019) syntax, all apparent differences among languages are deemed to be\nlexical in nature. Thus it would seem that, although the syntactic component as such is\ntrimmed down, more and more information is now delegated to the lexicon.\n[3] For an overview of earlier attempts at integration see Plank (1998).\n[4] In the second edition of Ruhlen\u2019s classification, two major language families \u2013 Korean-\nJapanese-Ainu and Kartvelian \u2013 are distinguished that were considered sub-branches of\nlarger phyla (Altaic and Caucasian, respectively) in the first edition of this work. Note that\nour reliance on Ruhlen\u2019s classification does not necessarily commit us to all its details,\ncriticized particularly for postulating very large language families for which the evidence is\nweak. Since the sampling method used here mitigates the effects on the sample of the\npostulation of large phyla, this criticism hardly affects the constitution of our sample.\nK. H E N G E V E L D, J.

Where possible, we have selected\nlanguages that are spoken in non-contiguous areas.\nThe sample represents also maximal typological diversity. Given our\nspecific research question, we made sure that among the languages selected\nthere are representatives of all major parts-of-speech systems as indentified in\nsection 3. In one case the typological criterion forced us to slightly violate the\ngenetic criterion: instead of choosing another language from a Formosan\nbranch of Austric, we included Tagalog, which now represents the Western\nbranch of the large Malayo-Polynesian family.\nAfro-Asiatic (2)       Chadic (1) \n     Cushitic (1) \nAltaic (1) \nAmerind (7)    Northern (2)  Almosan-Keresiouan (1) \n          Penutian (1) \n     Andean (1) \n     Equatorial-Tucanoan (1) \n     Ge-Pano-Carib (1) \n     Central Amerind (1) \n     Chibchan-Paezan (1) \nAustralian (3)   Gunwinyguan (1) \n     Pama-Nyungan (1) \n     Nunggubuyu (1) \nAustric (6)    Austro-Tai (4) Daic (1) \n          Austronesian (3) Malayo-Pol.

For three out of the\n53 languages that were selected according to the genetic criterion, data are\ninsufficient or lacking. The languages concerned are the three isolates,\nEtruscan, Meroitic and Nahali. Thus the actual sample contains 50\nlanguages.\n3. PA R T S O F S P E E C H\n3.1 The syntactic approach\nHengeveld (1992a, b) presents a classification of parts-of-speech systems and\ndemonstrates the predictive value of this classification for the typology of\nsystems of non-verbal predication. The classification is syntactically-based,\nthat is, lexeme classes are defined in terms of the syntactic slots they may\noccupy.\nThe four syntactic slots investigated are head and modifier of a referential\nphrase (i.e. noun phrase), and head and modifier of a predicate phrase.\nHeads are obligatory slots and modifiers are optional slots within phrases.\nThe distinguishing uses of classes of lexemes may be represented as in\nfigure 1.\nThe four categories of lexemes in figure 1 may be defined as follows: a\nVERB (V) is a lexeme that can be used as the head of a predicate phrase\nonly; a NOUN (N) is a lexeme that can be used as the head of a referential\nphrase; an ADJECTIVE (A) is a lexeme that can be used as a modifier within\na referential phrase; and a MANNER ADVERB (MAdv) is a lexeme that can\nbe used as a modifier within a predicate phrase. Note that within the class\nof adverbs we restrict ourselves to manner adverbs. We exclude other\nclasses of adverbs, such as temporal and spatial ones, which do not\nmodify the head of the predicate phrase, but rather modify the sentence as\na whole.\nIn contrast with many earlier approaches, Bhat (1994) being a clear ex-\nception, lexemes are thus defined primarily in terms of their non-predicative\nuses. Verbs are characterized by the fact that they have no non-predicative\nuses, i.e. they can be used predicatively only. Non-verbal lexemes, on the\nother hand, may have additional, predicative uses, but their defining use is\na non-predicative one.\nHead Modifier \nPredicate phrase verb manner adverb \nReferential phrase noun adjective \nFigure 1\nLexemes and syntactic slots\nK.

S I E W I E R S K A\n530\n3.2 Differentiated, flexible and rigid systems\nSome languages have separate lexeme classes, i.e. noun, adjective, verb and\nmanner adverb, to fill each of the syntactic slots under investigation. English5\nis a case in point:\n(1) The littleA girlN dancedV beautifullyMAdv.\nA language such as English can be said to have a DIFFERENTIATED PARTS-OF-\nSPEECH SYSTEM.\nOther languages do not have separate lexical classes for each of the syn-\ntactic slots. These languages are of two types, as illustrated in (2)\u2013(4).\nWarao (Romero-Figeroa 1997: 49f.)\n(2) (a) yakera\nbeauty\n\u2018beauty\u2019\n(b) Hiaka yakera auka saba tai nisa-n-a-e.\ngarment beauty daughter for she buy-SG-PUNCT-PAST\n\u2018She bought a beautiful dress for her daughter. \u2019\nGaro (Burling 1961: 27, 33)\n(3) (a) Da\u2019r-an-gen.\nbig-IT-FUT\n\u2018It will get big. \u2019\n(b) da\u2019r-gipa mande\nbig-REL man\n\u2018the big man\u2019\n(4) (a) Ca\u2019-gen-ma.\neat-FUT-INT\n\u2018Will you eat?\u2019\n(b) ca\u2019 -gipa mande\neat-REL man\n\u2018the man who eats \u2019\nIn Warao the translational equivalents of English adjectives and nouns can\nbe used both as heads of referential phrases and as modifiers within refer-\nential phrases. An example is the lexeme yakera \u2018beauty\u2019 in (2), which is\nused as the head of a referential phrase in (2a) and as a modifier within a\nreferential phrase in (2b). In Garo, on the other hand, the translational\nequivalents of English adjectives and verbs, e.g. da\u2019r \u2018big\u2019 in (3) and ca\u2019\n\u2018eat \u2019 in (4), seem at first sight to be used both as heads of predicate phrases,\n[5] In English there are of course many cases of zero conversion between the classes of noun\nand verb. These cases will be discussed in 3.4.\nP A R T S- O F- S P E E C H S Y S T E M S A N D W O R D O R D E R\n531\nas in (3a) and (4a), and as modifiers within referential phrases, as in (3b)\nand (4b).\nFacts like these have led many authors (Schachter 1985, Wetzer 1996,\nStassen 1997) to conclude that there are \u2018adjectival-noun\u2019 languages, such as\nWarao, and \u2018adjectival-verb\u2019 languages, such as Garo, as if these were\ntwo equivalent options. This approach overlooks an important difference\nbetween the two types of language. In Warao there is indeed one class of\nlexemes which may occur as head and as modifier within a referential\nphrase, i.e. members of this class may occupy two different syntactic slots.\nBut in Garo this is not the case. In order to use the lexemes involved as\nmodifiers within a referential phrase, they have to be relativized, which\nshows that the modifier slot is not occupied by a lexical unit but by a syn-\ntactic unit, in this case a relative clause. Within this clause the lexeme func-\ntions as the head of a predicate phrase, i.e. as a verb, just as it does in main\nclauses.\nThus, Warao has one class of lexemes which may occupy the syntactic\nslots of head and modifier within a referential phrase, whereas Garo lacks a\nclass of lexical elements which may occupy the modifier slot in a referential\nphrase, and therefore this language has to resort to alternative, non-lexical\nstrategies. A language such as Warao can be said to have a FLEXIBLE PARTS-\nOF-SPEECH SYSTEM, whereas a language such as Garo can be said to have a\nRIGID PARTS-OF-SPEECH SYSTEM.\nThis difference extends to the class of manner adverbs as well. Consider\nthe following examples:\nWarao (Romero-Figeroa 1997: 119)\n(5) Oko kuana yaota-te arone yakera nahoro-te_\nwe hardness work-NPAST although beauty eat-NPAST\n\u2018Although we work hard and eat well,_ . \u2019\nGaro (Burling 1961 : 29)\n(6) (a) Rak-e dok-aha.\nstrong-SUB hit-PAST\n\u2018He hit hard. \u2019\n(b) Bia gar-e kat-an-aha.\n3.SG throw-SUB run-IT-PAST\n\u2018Throwing, he ran away.\u2019\nIn Warao the modifier slot in a predicate phrase may be occupied by lexical\nelements which also occur as heads and modifiers within referential phrases,\nas is evident from a comparison of (5) with (2). In Garo the manner ex-\npression is a verb with the suffix -e, which is a subordinating suffix with a\nmanner meaning that can be added to any kind of verb, as (6a), which con-\ntains the verb rak- \u2018 (be) strong\u2019, shows. So again Warao shows flexibility in\nits parts-of-speech system, whereas Garo shows rigidity.\nK. H E N G E V E L D, J. R I J K H OFF & A. S I E W I E R S K A\n532\nThe differences among Warao, English and Garo are represented in\nfigure 2. This figure shows that Warao has a class of lexical elements, NON-\nVERBS, which combine the functions that nouns, adjectives and manner ad-\nverbs have in languages with a differentiated parts-of-speech system, whereas\nin Garo lexical elements which fulfil the functions of adjectives and manner\nadverbs are simply lacking.\n3.3 The parts-of-speech hierarchy\nThe degree of flexibility\/rigidity displayed within a parts-of-speech system\ndiffers from language to language. Interestingly, the combinations of syn-\ntactic possibilities for a single lexical class in flexible languages and the lack\nof lexical classes for certain syntactic slots in rigid languages are not random.\nThe variation can be described in terms of the hierarchy in (7).\n(7) Parts-of-speech hierarchy\nHead of > Head of > Modifier of > Modifier of\npredicate referential referential predicate\nphrase phrase phrase phrase\nThe parts-of-speech hierarchy should be interpreted in the following way:\nthe more to the left a certain syntactic slot is positioned in the hierarchy, the\nmore likely it is for a language to have a separate class of lexemes for that\nsyntactic slot.6 This means that if a rigid language lacks a class of lexemes\nthat may be used as modifiers within a referential phrase, i.e. adjectives, it\nwill also lack a class of lexemes that may be used as modifiers within predi-\ncate phrases, i.e. manner adverbs. And if a flexible language has a class\nof lexemes that may be used as heads and modifiers in referential phrases,\nthese lexemes will also be used as modifiers within predicate phrases, i.e. this\nlanguage has a class of non-verbs. A number of parts-of-speech systems are\npredicted by this hierarchy, the differences between them depending on the\ndegree of flexibility\/rigidity displayed.\nLanguage Head of \npredicate phrase \nHead of \nreferential phrase \nModifier of \nreferential phrase \nModifier of \npredicate phrase \nWarao verb non-verb \nEnglish verb noun adjective manner adverb\nGaro verb noun \u2013 \u2013 \nFigure 2\nFlexible, differentiated and rigid languages 1\n[6] Each of the steps in the hierarchy correlates with a number of other features of a language.\nSee, for example, Rijkhoff (2002: 141\u2013145; 2003), who proposes necessary conditions for the\noccurrence of distinct classes of verbs, nouns and adjectives in a language.\nP A R T S- O F- S P E E C H S Y S T E M S A N D W O R D O R D E R\n533\nA lower degree of flexibility than that observed in Warao can be found in\nNgiti, and a lower degree of rigidity than that observed in Garo can be found\nin Wambon:\nNgiti (Kutsch Lojenga 1993: 338)\n(8) (a) Ngba\u00b4ngba n\u0131\u00b4tdu` \u0001scB a`nc& .\nchild 3.carry.PF.PRS light load\n\u2018The child carried a light load. \u2019\n(b) \u0142scB ngba\u00b4ngba n\u0131\u00b4tdu` a`nc& .\nlight child 3.carry.PF.PRS load\n\u2018The child carried the load easily. \u2019\nWambon (de Vries & de Vries-Wiersma 1992: 19, 90)\n(9) (a) Jakhov-e matet-mo ka-lembo?\nthey-CONN good-VR.SS go-3.PL.PAST\n\u2018Did they travel well ? \u2019\n(b) Nggerkaji-ke-levambo-n-o ko-khe-n-o\nsaw-VR-1.PL.PAST-TR-CO go-3.SG.PRS-TR-CO\nkutip-ke-lo nda-tulo la-levambo.\nnight-VR-SS come-ascend.SS sleep-1.PL.PAST\n\u2018We continued sawing until the night fell and we went up and slept \u2019.\nIn Ngiti the word \u0001scB \u2018 light, easily\u2019 can be used as a modifier within a refer-\nential phrase, as in (8a), and as a modifier within a predicate phrase, as in\n(8b). Wambon, on the other hand, lacks a class of manner adverbs. It uses\nmedial verb constructions to create manner expressions. This can be seen in\n(9a), where the verb form matetmo, a verbalized form of the adjective matet\n\u2018good\u2019, is the head of the predicate phrase of the medial verb construction,\nwhich itself modifies the main verb. The medial verb construction is a\ncosubordinating strategy widely used in the language, as illustrated in (9b).\nThus, Ngiti combines the functions of adjectives and manner adverbs in\na single class of lexical elements, MODIFIERS, whereas Wambon lacks a class\nof manner adverbs and compensates for this absence by means of a\nsyntactic solution. The differences between Ngiti and Wambon are shown in\nfigure 3.\nA higher degree of flexibility than that observed in Warao and a higher\ndegree of rigidity than that observed in Garo can also be found. The flexible\nextreme defined by the parts-of-speech hierarchy is a language with no\nlexical specialization at all. An example in our sample is Samoan. In this\nlanguage any lexical item can basically be used in any syntactic slot, the\nonly restriction being semantic compatibility. The following examples il-\nlustrate the flexibility of lexical items in Samoan in three different ways.\nFirst, a particularly striking property of Samoan is that the translational\nequivalents of an English noun can be used not only as the head of a\nK. H E N G E V E L D, J. R I J K H OFF & A. S I E W I E R S K A\n534\nreferential phrase but also as the head of a predicate phrase, as in (10),\nwhereas the translational equivalent of an English verb can not only be used\nas the head of a predicate phrase but also as the head of a referential phrase,\nas in (11).\nSamoan (Mosel & Hovdhaugen 1992: 80, 73)\n(10) (a) \u2018Ua ma\u00aflosi le la\u00af.\nPERF strong ART sun\n\u2018The sun is strong. \u2019 (\u2018The sun strongs. \u2019)\n(b) \u2018Ua la\u00af le aso.\nPERF sun ART day\n\u2018The day is sunny. \u2019 (\u2018The day suns. \u2019)\n(11) (a) E alu le pasi i Apia\nGENR go ART bus DIR Apia\n\u2018The bus goes to Apia. \u2019\n(b) le alu o le pasi i Apia\nART go POSS ART bus DIR Apia\n\u2018 the going of the bus to Apia\u2019\nSecondly, the translational equivalent of an English noun can be used as\na modifier within a referential phrase, as in (12), or as a modifier within a\npredicate phrase, as in (13). Note that the absence of an article with the\nmodifying lexeme shows that the lexeme is used in a non-referential slot.\nSamoan (Mosel & Hovdhaugen 1992: 305, 394)\n(12) le fale ta\u2018avale\nART house car\n\u2018the garage\u2019 (\u2018 the car house\u2019)\n(13) \u2018Ua ma\u2018 i misela le tama.\nPERF sick measles ART boy\n\u2018The boy has got the measles. \u2019 (\u2018The boy sicks measlewise. \u2019)\nThirdly, the translational equivalent of an English verb can be used as\na modifier within a referential phrase, as in (14), and as a modifier within a\npredicate phrase, as in (15). Here the absence of a tense-aspect particle with\nthe modifying lexeme shows that the lexeme is used non-predicatively.\nLanguage Head of\npredicate phrase\nHead of\nreferential phrase\nModifier of\nreferential phrase\nModifier of\npredicate phrase\nNgiti verb noun modifier \nEnglish verb noun adjective manner adverb\nWambon verb noun adjective \u2013 \nFigure 3\nFlexible, differentiated and rigid languages 2\nP A R T S- O F- S P E E C H S Y S T E M S A N D W O R D O R D E R\n535\nSamoan (Mosel & Hovdhaugen 1992: 294, 397)\n(14) le mea ta\u2018alo\nART thing play\n\u2018the toy\u2019 (\u2018 the play thing\u2019)\n(15) _. \u2018olo\u2018o moe taagulu ai Vesi\n_. PROGR sleep snore ANAPH Vesi\n\u2018_ where Vesi was sleeping snoring. \u2019\nThe rigid extreme defined by the hierarchy in (7) would be a language that\nhas verbs only. Such a language is not attested in our sample, but a sample\nlanguage that helps to understand what an extremely rigid language might\nlook like is Tuscarora.7 This language does have a class of morphological\nnouns (see Mithun 2000). In many cases, however, in this language one has\nto use a full predication in order to render the meaning of an English noun.\nExamples (16) and (17) illustrate this phenomenon.\nTuscarora (Mithun 1976: 35, 30)\n(16) ra-kwatihs\nM-young\n\u2018boy\u2019 (\u2018He is young. \u2019)\n(17) ka-teskr-ahs\nNHUM-stink-ASP\n\u2018goat\u2019 (\u2018It stinks. \u2019)\nThus, many lexemes in Tuscarora have a predicative use only and should\ntherefore be classified as verbs. As a consequence, what in many other\nlanguages would be a single predication may in Tuscarora show up as a set of\nappositional predications, as shown in (18) :\nTuscarora (Mithun 1976: 32)\n(18) ra-kwatihs wa-hr-atkahto-? ka-teskr-ahs\nM-young PAST-M-look.at-ASP NHUM-stink-ASP\n\u2018The boy looked at the goat. \u2019 (\u2018He is young, he looked at it, it stinks. \u2019)\nIn a similar way appositional predications are used instead of adjectival and\nadverbial modifiers, as shown in (19) and (20).\nTuscarora (Mithun 1976: 234, 256)\n(19) ta\u00b4 :ko:h yaw-vhey-v?\ncat NHUM.OBJ-die-PF\n\u2018 the dead cat \u2019 (\u2018 the cat, it has died\/is dead\u2019)\nor \u2018The cat has died\/is dead. \u2019\n[7] An extensive and insightful discussion of the verbal orientation of Iroquoian languages\nmay be found in Sasse (1988).\nK.

Figure 4 shows\nthe differences between a purely flexible language such as Samoan and an\nunattested purely rigid language.\n3.4 Parts-of-speech systems\nThe combination of the threefold distinction between flexible, differentiated\nand rigid languages with the parts-of-speech hierarchy results in the classifi-\ncation of parts-of-speech systems presented in figure 5.\nIn interpreting this classification the following points have to be taken into\naccount:\n(i) In classifying languages in terms of the parts-of-speech hierarchy in (7),\nwe have taken both basic and derived lexemes into consideration. Thus,\nEnglish is classified as a language with a class of manner adverbs,\ndespite the fact that virtually all these adverbs are derived.\nLanguage Head of\npredicate phrase\nHead of\nreferential phrase\nModifier of\nreferential phrase\nModifier of\npredicate phrase\nSamoan contentive \nEnglish verb noun adjective manner adverb\n(unattested) verb \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \nFigure 4\nFlexible, differentiated and rigid languages 3\nParts-of-speech\nsystem (PoS)\nHead of\npredicate phrase \nHead of\nreferential phrase\nModifier of\nreferential phrase\nModifier of\npredicate phrase \n1 contentive\n2 verb non-verb Flexible\n3 verb noun modifier \nDifferentiated 4 verb noun adjective manner adverb\n5 verb noun adjective \u2013 \n6 verb noun \u2013 \u2013 Rigid \n7 verb \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \nFigure 5\nParts-of-speech systems\nP A R T S- O F- S P E E C H S Y S T E M S A N D W O R D O R D E R\n537\n(ii) In order for a language to qualify as flexible, it has to show SYSTEMATIC\nflexibility, both semantically and syntactically, for an entire class of\nlexemes. Thus, English is not classified as a flexible language, despite\nthe fact that in this language there are many cases of zero conversion\nbetween the classes of noun and verb.8\n(iii) The use of lexemes in syntactic slots can only be evaluated to the\nextent that languages actually have these slots available. For instance,\nHimmelmann (forthcoming a) shows that Tagalog does not have a slot\nfor manner modifiers. Instead, it uses a complement-taking predicate\ndescribing the manner in which the event described in the subordinate\nclause takes place. In cases like these, the parts-of-speech system of a\nlanguage has to be determined on the basis of the behaviour of lexeme\nclasses with respect to their distribution across the remaining slots.\n3.5 Intermediate systems\nSome languages do not fit into the basic classification of parts-of-speech\nsystems given in figure 5. All these languages occupy intermediate po-\nsitions between contiguous types in figure 5. They can thus be said to have\nINTERMEDIATE PARTS-OF-SPEECH SYSTEMS. The criteria for classifying a lan-\nguage as having an intermediate parts-of-speech system are different for\nflexible and rigid languages.\nIn order for a flexible language to qualify as having an intermediate parts-\nof-speech system, its lexeme classes should be compatible with two contigu-\nous systems within the hierarchy at the same time. This situation may obtain,\nfor instance, when derived lexemes have fewer functional possibilities than\nbasic lexemes within a language. Thus, Mundari is a fully flexible type 1\nlanguage if its basic lexemes are taken into consideration, but it also has a\nderivational process that produces lexemes that can be used in all slots apart\nfrom the predicate slot, a type 2 feature. In order to account for these facts,\nMundari is classified as a type 1\/2 language. Another example of a language\nwith an intermediate system is Lango, which displays a lower degree\nof flexibility than Mundari. In this language, there is a large open class of\nlexemes that may be used as modifiers within referential phrases and as\nmodifiers within predicate phrases. On the basis of this fact, it should be\nclassified as a type 3 language. In addition, however, it has a large open class\nof manner adverbs, a feature of a type 4 language. Therefore, Lango is\nclassified as a type 3\/4 language.\nA rigid language is classified as having an intermediate parts-of-speech\nsystem when the last class of lexemes on the hierarchy that is relevant for\nthat language is a small closed class of items. Thus, Pipil is a language that\n[8] See Vogel (2000) on the classification of English in terms of the typology of parts-of-speech\nsystems used in this article.\nK. H E N G E V E L D, J. R I J K H OFF & A. S I E W I E R S K A\n538\nhas an open class of adjectives but a restricted set of manner adverbs\nborrowed from Spanish, and is therefore classified as a type 4\/5 language.\nTamil, a language with a higher degree of rigidity, has no manner adverbs.\nIt does have adjectives, but only a very limited number of them in a small\nclosed class. For this reason, it is classified as a type 5\/6 language.\n3.6 Classification of sample languages\nIncluding the intermediate types discussed in the previous paragraph,\nlanguages may be assigned to one of 13 types. Our sample languages fit into\nthese types in the way indicated in table 2. In this table the languages are\nordered from extremely flexible (type 1) to extremely rigid (type 7).\n3.7 The semantics of flexible lexemes\nAt this point it might be appropriate to briefly discuss the semantics of\nflexible lexemes (contentives, non-verbs, modifiers), since this appears to\nhave led to confusion among some of the reviewers of our typology of\nparts-of-speech systems. For example, both Evans (2000: 729) and Croft\nPoS  Languages \n1  Samoan, Tagalog \n1\/2 Mundari \n2  Hurrian, Quechua, Warao \n2\/3  Turkish \n3  Ket, Miao, Ngiti, Tidore \n3\/4  Lango \n4   Abkhaz, Arapesh, Babungo, Bambara, Basque, \nBurushaski, Georgian, Hittite, Hungarian, Itelmen, \nJapanese, Nama, Ngalakan, Polish \n4\/5  Koasati, Nasioi, Paiwan, Pipil, Sumerian \n5   Alamblak, Berbice Dutch, Guaran\u00ed, Kayardild, Kisi, \nOromo, Wambon \n5\/6  Garo, Gude, Mandarin Chinese, Nung, Tamil, West\nGreenlandic \n6  Hixkaryana, Krongo, Navaho, Nivkh, Nunggubuyu \n6\/7  Tuscarora \n7  \u2013 \nTable 2\nParts-of-speech systems of sample languages\nP A R T S- O F- S P E E C H S Y S T E M S A N D W O R D O R D E R\n539\n(2001: 70\u201375) use terms such as \u2018polysemy\u2019 and \u2018semantic shift \u2019 when they\ndiscuss the semantics of flexible lexemes, which they interpret as having\ndistinct but related senses. In our analysis, however, flexible lexemes are\nSEMANTICALLY VAGUE, i.e. they are monosemous.\nA well-known example of semantic vagueness is English \u2018cousin\u2019, which\nis vague with respect to the distinction \u2018male cousin\u2019 and \u2018female cousin\u2019, or,\nas Cruse (1986: 51) puts it : \u2018 the two meanings \u2018\u2018male cousin\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018 female\ncousin\u2019\u2019 are both associated with the same lexical unit cousin, whose mean-\ning is more general than either; they therefore do not represent distinct\nsenses of cousin\u2019. This can be demonstrated with a test which involves\nanaphoric reference with so (Saeed 2003: 61) :\n(21) Sarah is my cousin, and so is Peter.\nIf a noun has a vague meaning, as in the case of cousin in (21), its sense allows\nfor different specifications in the case of anaphoric reference with so. In this\narticle we are concerned with a more fundamental and abstract kind of\nvagueness, categorial vagueness, which holds across distinct lexical categor-\nies (verbs, nouns, etc.) and is therefore more difficult to identify.\nThe idea that flexible lexemes are semantically vague rather than poly-\nsemous finds initial support in what has been written about the semantic\nnature of flexible lexemes in the grammars of the languages in question.\nThus, Mosel & Hovdhaugen (1992: 73) write about Samoan that \u2018categ-\norization of full words is not given a priori in the lexicon. It is only their\nactual occurrence in a particular environment which gives them the status\nof a verb or a noun\u2019. In a similar vein, Hoffmann (1903: xxxii) notes the\n\u2018 functional elasticity\u2019 of Mundari lexemes.\nFrom a typological perspective, semantic vagueness (also known as\n\u2018underspecification\u2019, \u2018non-determinedness \u2019, \u2018 indeterminacy\u2019, \u2018generality \u2019) is\nnot an uncommon phenomenon. For example, nouns in many (perhaps\neven most) languages across the globe are transnumeral in that the same\n(unmarked) noun may be used to refer to a single individual or to a plurality\nof entities (Rijkhoff 2002: chapters 2 and 5). Vagueness is also attested\nin members of other word classes, such as verbs. For example, McGregor\n(2002: 54\u201387) shows that in Northwest Australian languages many unin-\nflecting verbs (\u2018preverbs\u2019) are essentially vague with respect to certain\nAktionsart distinctions, valency, and reflexivity ; Bisang (1996: 520) mentions\nthe high degree of indeterminateness of nouns and verbs in the languages\nof East and Mainland South East Asia.\nWilkins\u2019 (2000) account of noun semantics in Arrernte is particularly in-\nstructive in the present context. In Arrernte and other Australian languages\nNPs consist of a specific noun preceded by a generic noun.9 Together these\n[9] On this construction see also Dixon (1980: 102f.).\nK. H E N G E V E L D, J. R I J K H OFF & A. S I E W I E R S K A\n540\nnouns constitute what Wilkins calls \u2018classifier constructions\u2019 and he argues\nthat these constructions serve to determine which properties of an entity\nare relevant from the perspective of the current discourse context (Wilkins\n2000: 148). Consider the following examples :\n(22) Arrernte (Wilkins 2000: 179\u2013200)\n(a) yerre arlkerrke\nant meat-ant\n(b) awelye arlkerrke\ntraditional medicine meat-ant\n(c) apmere arlkerrke\nsocially.relevant.place meat-ant\nWilkins (2000: 179\u2013200) provides detailed, monosemous definitions of both\nthe specific noun arlkerrke \u2018meat-ant \u2019 and the three generic nouns yerre\n\u2018ant \u2019, awelye \u2018 traditional medicine\u2019 and apmere \u2018 socially relevant place\u2019, and\ngoes on to argue that each combination of a generic noun (yerre, awelye,\napmere) and the specific noun arlkerrke highlights a different set of culture-\nspecific knowledge structures associated with arlkerrke and that as a conse-\nquence the other knowledge structures associated with arlkerrke are\ndownplayed and backgrounded. For example, according to Wilkins (2000:\n192), the semantic effect of the combination awelye arlkerrke in (22b) could be\nparaphrased as follows: \u2018In using the classifier construction awelye arlkerrke\n\u2018\u2018 traditional medicine meat-ant \u2019\u2019 in a noun phrase, the speaker wants the\naddressee to think about the referent of the noun phrase from the point\nof view of its having the properties of an arlkerrke \u2018\u2018meat-ant \u2019\u2019 but whose\ndiscourse properties at the current point in the discourse are its properties as\nan awelye \u2018\u2018 traditional medicine\u2019\u2019 \u2019.\nWe propose a similar approach to the meaning and the function of flexible\nlexemes: each flexible lexeme has a single (vague) sense. By placing the flex-\nible lexeme in a particular syntactic slot or by providing it with certain\nmorphological markers, the speaker highlights those meaning components\nof the flexible lexeme that are relevant for a certain lexical (verbal, nominal,\netc.) function. Thus we contend that the meaning of a flexible lexeme always\nremains the same, and that morpho-syntactic and other contextual clues\nsignal to the addressee how to interpret this lexeme in an actual utterance. In\nother words, it is the use of a vague lexeme in a certain context (an actual\nlinguistic expression) that brings out certain parts of its meaning, giving\nthe category-neutral lexeme a particular categorial (verbal, nominal, etc.)\nflavour.\nNote, finally, that even though a flexible lexeme is not semantically\nambiguous, the employment of a flexible lexeme may lead to functional\nambiguity, as when the context does not provide sufficient clues regarding\nthe way it is used in the actual linguistic expression. We will return to the\nissue of functional ambiguity in section 5.1 below.\nP A R T S- O F- S P E E C H S Y S T E M S A N D W O R D O R D E R\n541\n4. WO R D O R D E R A N D M O R P H O L O G I C A L M A R K E R S\n4.1 Introduction\nEver since Greenberg (1966) the domain of word order has constituted one\nof the major testing grounds for the predictive power of potential typological\nparameters. We too will document the merits of our classification of parts-\nof-speech systems by showing how it interacts with word order phenomena\nand how it helps to refine some of the word order correlations established by\nGreenberg and others. In section 5, several word order predictions stemming\nfrom our classification of parts-of-speech systems will be presented. These\npredictions will involve the basic and variable orders of the predicate and\nits arguments, of the head and modifier in the referential phrase, and of the\nhead and modifier in the predicate phrase. But first some comments on our\nclassification of these linearization patterns and their distribution among the\nlanguages in the sample are in order.\n4.2 Clausal order and morphological marking\nGiven the existence of languages without a true class of verbs, we classify\nclausal word order in terms of the location of predicates, rather than of\nverbs, relative to their arguments. Though main, positive, declarative clauses\nwith two overt referential phrases are not necessarily highly frequent in\nlanguages, our classification is based on the order obtaining in such clauses,\nas in most typological classifications of clausal word order. However, rather\nthan using the traditional Greenbergian six-way typology of SVO, SOV,\nVSO, VOS, OVS and OSV, we use a three-way typology of predicate-initial,\npredicate-medial and predicate-final clausal orders. This three-way typology\nbased on the position of the predicate has two major advantages over the\nsix-way typology. First of all, since languages exhibit more variation in\nthe location of the transitive arguments relative to each other than in the\nlocation of the predicate phrase relative to both of the arguments (see e.g.\nSteele 1978, Siewierska 1998), it is easier to assign a basic order to languages\nin terms of the three-way typology than in terms of the six-way typology.\nSecondly, of the three logically possible locations of the predicate phrase\nin transitive clauses, the predicate-initial and predicate-final positions\nare directly applicable to the classification of clause ordering in intransitive\nclauses. Consequently, the predicate-based typology allows one to capture\nany consistencies in the ordering of transitive and intransitive predicates\nthat may obtain in a transparent manner.\nOur major criterion for assigning a basic order is statistical frequency. In\nlanguages exhibiting considerable word order variation, we assign a unique\nbasic order only if one of the word order patterns is at least twice as common\nas any other order, following Dryer (1997). If there is no such distribution,\nno basic order is assigned.\nK. H E N G E V E L D, J. R I J K H OFF & A. S I E W I E R S K A\n542\nA complete overview of our word order data is given in table 3. In this\ntable \u2018 irr \u2019 indicates that the parameter under investigation is irrelevant to\nthe language concerned, in view of the absence of one or more of the parts\nof speech under investigation. The distribution of basic (BWO) clausal\norders among the languages in our sample is shown in column 1, in which\n1=predicate-initial order, 2=predicate-medial order, and 3=predicate-final\norder. The languages with double classifications, either 1\/2 or 2\/3, are\nlanguages in which the order is dependent on tense\/aspect (e.g. Gude, Kisi,\nClause Referential phrase Predicate phrase  \nLanguage 1 \nBWO \n2 \nFixSP \n3 \nMorph \n4 \nBWO \n5 \nFixSP \n6 \nMorph \n7 \nBWO \n8 \nFixSP \n9 \nMorph \nAbkhaz \nAlamblak \nArapesh \nBabungo \nBambara \nBasque \nBerbice Dutch \nBurushaski \nGaro \nGeorgian \nGuaran\u00ed \nGude \nHittite \nHixkaryana \nHungarian \nHurrian \nItelmen \nJapanese \nKayardild \nKet \nKisi \nKoasati \nKrongo \nLango \nMandarin Chinese \nMiao \nMundari \nNama \nNasioi \nNavaho \nNgalakan \nNgiti \nNivkh \nNung \nNunggubuyu \nOromo \nPaiwan \nPipil \nPolish \nQuechua \nSamoan \nSumerian \nTagalog \nTamil \nTidore \nTurkish \nTuscarora \nWambon \nWarao \nWest Greenlandic \n3 \n3 \n2 \n2 \n3 \n3 \n2 \n3 \n3 \n2\/3 \n2 \n1\/2 \n3 \n2 \n2\/3 \n3 \n2\/3 \n3 \n1\/2\/3 \n3 \n2\/3 \n3 \n1\/2 \n2 \n2 \n2 \n3 \n3 \n3 \n3 \n1\/2 \n2\/3 \n3 \n2 \n1\/2\/3 \n3 \n1 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n1 \n3 \n1 \n3 \n2 \n3 \n2 \n3 \n3 \n3 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n+ \n+ \n+ \n\u2013 \n+ \n\u2013 \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n+ \n+ \n+ \n\u2013 \n+ \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n+ \n+ \n+ \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n+ \n\u2013 \n+ \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n+ \n+ \n\u2013 \n+ \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \nirr \nirr \nirr \n\u2013 \nirr \n\u2013 \nirr \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \nirr \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \nirr \nirr \nirr \n\u2013 \nirr \nirr \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \nirr \n\u2013 \nirr \nirr \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \nirr \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n+ \n+ \nirr \n+ \n\u2013 \nirr \nirr \n\u2013 \nirr \nirr \n\u2013 \nHM \nMHM \nMHM \nHM \nHM \nHM \nMH \nMH \nHM \nMH \nHM \nMH \nMHM \nirr \nMH \nMH \nMHM \nMH \nMH \nMH \nHM \nHM \nirr \nHM \nMH \nHM \nMH \nMH \nHM \nirr \nHM \nMH \nirr \nHM \nirr \nHM \nHM \nMH \nMHM \nMH \nHM \nHM \nMHM \nMH \nHM \nMH \nirr \nHM \nHM \nHM \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n+ \n+ \n\u2013 \n+ \n\u2013 \n+ \n+ \n+ \n+ \n\u2013 \nirr \n+ \n+ \n\u2013 \n+ \n\u2013 \n+ \n+ \n+ \nirr \n+ \n+ \n+ \n+ \n+ \n\u2013 \nirr \n\u2013 \n+ \nirr \n+ \nirr \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n+ \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n+ \n+ \n+ \nirr \n+ \n+ \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \nirr \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n+ \n\u2013 \nirr \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \nirr \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \nirr \n\u2013 \nirr \n\u2013 \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \nirr \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \nMH \nirr \nMHM \nHM \nHM \nMH \nirr \nMH \n irr \nMH \nirr \nirr \nMH \nirr \nMH \nMH \nMH \nMH \nirr \nMH \nirr \nMHM \nirr \nHM \nirr \nHM \nMH \nMH \nMH \nirr \nMH \nMHM \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nHM \nMH \nMHM \nMH \nHM \nMH \nirr \nirr \nHM \nMH \nirr \nirr \nirr \nMH \n+ \nirr \n\u2013 \n+ \n+ \n+ \nirr \n\u2013 \nirr \n+ \nirr \nirr \n+ \nirr \n+ \n+ \n+ \n+ \nirr \n+ \nirr \n\u2013 \nirr \n+ \nirr \n+ \n+ \n+ \n+ \nirr \n+ \n\u2013 \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n+ \n+ \n+ \nirr \nirr \n+ \n+ \nirr \nirr \nirr \n+ \n\u2013 \nirr \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \nirr \n\u2013 \nirr \n\u2013 \nirr \nirr \n\u2013 \nirr \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \nirr \n\u2013 \nirr \n\u2013 \nirr \n+ \nirr \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \nirr \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \nirr \nirr \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \nirr \nirr \nirr \n+ \nTable 3\nWord order data\nP A R T S- O F- S P E E C H S Y S T E M S A N D W O R D O R D E R\n543\nKrongo, Ngiti) or languages which display two patterns with a comparable\ndegree of frequency due to pragmatic factors (e.g. Hungarian,10 Georgian11).\nThose with a triple classification are the languages which lack a basic order.\nThe percentage of predicate-initial languages (13.4%)12 in our sample is\nlower, and that of predicate-final languages (51.3%) higher, than in other\nsamples of comparable size, such as those of Steele (1978) or of Gilligan and\nof Perkins discussed in Hawkins & Gilligan (1988), while the percentage of\npredicate-medial languages (35.3%) is roughly the same.13 The differences are\npartly due to our assignment of double orders for languages in which order\nis dependent on tense\/aspect or on pragmatic factors.

Depending on the nature of the parts-of-speech system,\nthe head slot of the referential phrase may be filled with CONTENTIVES\n(in types 1\u20131\/2),14 NON-VERBS (in types 1\/2\u20132\/3), or NOUNS (in types 2\/3\u20136\/7).\nThe lexical modifier slot of the referential phrase may be filled with\nCONTENTIVES (in types 1\u20131\/2), NON-VERBS (in types 1\/2\u20132\/3), MODIFIERS (in types\n2\/3\u20133\/4) or ADJECTIVES (in types 3\/4\u20135\/6).\nAs in the case of clausal order, we assign a basic order for heads and\nmodifiers in referential phrases on the basis of frequency. Both basic orders\nare assigned to languages in which neither of the orders can be said to be\nmore frequent than the other. Languages in which both orders are possible\nbut for which the information available does not allow us to make a decision\non frequency are included in the latter category. The data are listed in\ncolumn 4 in table 3, where HM=head-modifier basic order, MH=modifier-\nhead basic order, and MHM=both basic orders.\nWe also list possible variation in the order of head and modifier with\nrespect to each other. In column 5 in table 3, a+indicates that there is a fixed\norder of H and M with respect to each other, i.e. the modifier either always\nprecedes or always follows the head, and a \u2013 indicates that there is variation\nin the ordering of head and modifier. Of course all languages which have\nbeen assigned two basic orders in column 4 are identified as languages with\nvariable order in column 5.\nColumn 6 indicates whether the language in question uses morphological\nmarkers that identify a modifier within a term phrase, such as an attributive\nparticle, or an agreement marker that is exclusively used with attributive\n[14] We use notations like \u20181\u20132\/3\u2019 to refer to the segment of the hierarchy from type 1 to type 2\/3,\nand thus including types 1\/2 and 2.\nP A R T S- O F- S P E E C H S Y S T E M S A N D W O R D O R D E R\n545\nmodifiers.15 In this column a+indicates that there is such a morphological\nmarker, axthat there isn\u2019t.\n4.4 Order and morphological markers in the predicate phrase\nThe data on order in the predicate phrase are comparable to those on order\nin the referential phrase. Column 7 in table 3 lists the basic order of heads\n(Hs) and lexical modifiers (Ms) within predicate phrases. Here we avoid the\nterms \u2018verb\u2019 and \u2018adverb\u2019, since, depending on the parts-of-speech system,\nthe head slot of the predicate phrase may be filled with CONTENTIVES (in types\n1\u20131\/2) or VERBS (in types 1\/2\u20137), and the lexical modifier slot of the predicate\nphrase may be filled with CONTENTIVES (in types 1\u20131\/2), NON-VERBS (in types\n1\/2\u20132\/3), MODIFIERS (in types 2\/3\u20133\/4) or MANNER ADVERBS (in types 3\/4\u20134\/5).\nThe basic orders listed are again based on relative frequency. Variation\nin the order of head and modifier with respect to each other is indicated in\ncolumn 8 in table 3.\nColumn 9 indicates whether the language involved uses morphological\nmarkers that identify a modifier within a predicate phrase, such as a particle\nused to mark manner modifiers. In this column, a+indicates that there is\nsuch a morphological marker, and ax that there isn\u2019t.\n5. HY P O T H E S E S A N D R E S U L T S\n5.1 General hypothesis\nAfter these preliminary introductions to our classification of parts-of-speech\nsystems and of word order phenomena, we now turn to the relation between\nparts-of-speech systems and word order. The distinction among flexible,\ndifferentiated and rigid languages, central to our classification of parts-\nof-speech systems, provides the basis for the general hypothesis in (23).\n(23) The existence of a specialized lexical class in a language, i.e. a lexical\nclass whose members are tied to one syntactic slot, makes it less\nnecessary for this language to mark this slot and the phrase within\nwhich this slot occurs syntactically or morphologically ; conversely, the\nexistence of a flexible lexical class in a language, i.e. a lexical class\nwhose members may occur in various syntactic slots, makes it more\nnecessary for this language to mark these slots and the phrases within\nwhich these slots occur syntactically or morphologically.\nThe central idea behind this hypothesis is that lexical specialization is an\nimportant factor contributing to disambiguation in the processing of con-\nstituents. Where lexical specialization is absent, additional disambiguating\n[15] When a language uses agreement with both attributively and predicatively used lexemes,\nagreement does not uniquely identify the modifier and is therefore not listed.\nK. H E N G E V E L D, J. R I J K H OFF & A. S I E W I E R S K A\n546\nstrategies will have to be invoked, i.e. there is a trade-off between lexical type\non the one hand and syntactic and morphological structure on the other.\nAmbiguity has been a central issue in psycholinguistic research since the\n1960s, mainly in investigating to what extent language processing is guided\nby syntactic or semantic strategies.16 Traditionally, two kinds of (temporary)\nambiguity are distinguished: lexical and syntactic. An example from Clark &\nClark (1977: 81) illustrates :\n(24) Lexical ambiguity\nAfter taking the right turn at the intersection, I_\n(25) Syntactic ambiguity\nKnowing that visiting relatives could be tiresome, I_\nIn the case of flexible lexemes, however, we are not dealing with lexical or\nsyntactic ambiguity (recall that flexible lexemes are semantically vague, i.e.\nthey are not polysemous; see section 3.7 above), but rather with FUNCTIONAL\nAMBIGUITY. When a flexible lexeme is being processed, the hearer has to\ndetermine how this lexeme is used, e.g. whether it serves as the head of a\nreferential phrase (nominal function) or as a modifier of the head of the\nreferential phrase (adjectival function).\nIn accordance with current psycholinguistic views on language processing\n(cf. Whitney 1998: 207, 222), we assume that\n(i) people utilize a strategy of \u2018Immediacy of Interpretation\u2019, which means\nthat they try to interpret each word as completely as possible as soon\nas the word is received;\n(ii) sentence processing is guided by multiple kinds of information (syntac-\ntic, semantic, pragmatic, visual, prosodic, etc.) ;\n(iii) ambiguity obstructs rapid and efficient language processing; in such\ncases the hearer will look for contextual and other clues to direct sen-\ntence comprehension.\nSince flexible lexemes are potentially ambiguous in that there is no lexi-\ncally coded information as to the precise function of the lexeme in the\nactual linguistic expression, we hypothesize that languages with flexible\nlexemes will have certain morphosyntactic strategies at their disposal that\nprovide the hearer with clues as to the correct interpretation of the flexible\nlexeme.\n[16] More recently research on ambiguity has focused on the question whether language pro-\ncessing is modular or integrative (for an overview, see, for example, Whitney 1998: chapter\n7). In the modular view, sentence comprehension occurs in a series of distinct and inde-\npendent stages. According to the integrative view, on the other hand, sentence processing is\nguided by various subprocesses which are in close communication with each other. Recent\npsycholinguistic research has produced strong support for the integrative view (Whitney\n1998: 231).\nP A R T S- O F- S P E E C H S Y S T E M S A N D W O R D O R D E R\n547\nMorphosyntactically, there are basically two possibilities to guide the\nhearer as regards the intended function of a flexible lexeme in the actual\nlinguistic expression: (i) morphological markers17 in the immediate linguistic\ncontext ; and (ii) syntactic patterning.18 We take the second strategy as our\npoint of departure, but we will come across languages in which morpho-\nlogical marking has the same disambiguating function as word order has\nin others. The nature of the potential functional ambiguity in flexible\nlanguages depends on the degree of flexibility of their parts-of-speech system.\nThe absence of a verb\/non-verb distinction leads to other potential functional\nambiguities other than the absence of an adjective\/adverb distinction. The\nfollowing sections present more concrete partial hypotheses, starting with\nlanguages with the most flexible parts-of-speech systems (types 1 and 1\/2) in\nsection 5.2. Then, in section 5.3, we will include in our predictions languages\nwith part-of-speech systems of types 1\u20132\/3, and finally, in section 5.4, we will\nbe concerned with all languages that have a flexible word class in their parts-\nof-speech systems (types 1\u20133\/4).\n5.2 The verb\/non-verb distinction\n5.2.1 Basic word order at the clause level\nIn languages without a distinct class of verbs, i.e. type 1 and 1\/2 in table 2\nabove, lexical information is insufficient for the identification of the predicate\nphrase and the referential phrases within a sentence, given that there are no\nseparate lexical classes that are used to fill the head slots of predicate phrases\nand referential phrases. Since the number of referential phrases in argument\nfunction in a sentence may vary, we are here particularly concerned with the\nposition of the main predicate. We predict that in these languages the main\npredicate should occupy a uniquely identifiable position under all circum-\nstances. Since only initial and final positions in the sentence are uniquely\nidentifiable,19 languages of types 1 and 1\/2 are not expected to have predicate-\nmedial basic word order, unless the problem of identifying the constituents\nof the clause is solved by morphological means.\nIn table 4 (in which the data from table 3 are reshuffled in such a way that\nthe languages are ordered on the basis of their parts-of-speech systems, from\nthe most flexible to the most rigid), the upper part of column 1 shows that\nthis expectation is borne out. In fact, the data show that the hypothesized\n[17] Note that we use the term \u2018morphological marker\u2019 to refer to a segmental grammatical\nmeans of expression, be it a free grammatical word (particle) or a bound morpheme.\n[18] A third disambiguating strategy is the use of prosody. Because of the lack of data we cannot\nsystematically discuss this strategy in this paper.\n[19] Even a rigid V2 position is not uniquely identifiable, since the number of words that make\nup the first constituent may vary.\nK.

Predicate-\nmedial basic order is not only absent in languages of types 1 and 1\/2 but also\nin languages of types 2 and 2\/3.20 We will present a possible explanation for\nthis fact after discussing word order variation at the sentence level.\nClause Referential phrase Predicate phrase  \nLanguage \n \nPoS \n1 \nBWO \n2 \nFixSP \n3 \nMorph \n4 \nBWO \n5 \nFixSP \n6 \nMorph \n7 \nBWO \n8 \nFixSP \n9 \nMorph \n \nSamoan \nTagalog \nMundari \nHurrian \nQuechua, Imbabura \nWarao \nTurkish \n \n1 \n1 \n1\/2 \n2 \n2 \n2 \n2\/3 \n \n1 \n1 \n3 \n3 \n3 \n3 \n3 \n \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n+ \n+ \n\u2013 \n+ \n+ \n \n+ \n+ \nirr \nirr \n+ \nirr \nirr \n \nHM \nMHM \nMH \nMH \nMH \nHM \nMH \n \n+ \n\u2013 \n+ \n+ \n+ \n+ \n+ \n \n\u2013 \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n \nHM \nirr \nMH \nMH \nMH \nMH \nMH \n \n+ \nirr \n+ \n+ \n+ \n+ \n+ \n \n\u2013 \nirr \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n+ \n\u2013 \nKet \nMiao \nNgiti \nTidore \nLango \n3 \n3 \n3 \n3 \n3\/4 \n3 \n2 \n2\/3 \n2 \n2 \n+ \n+ \n+ \n+ \n+ \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nMH \nHM \nMH \nHM \nHM \n+ \n+ \n+ \n+ \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n+ \nMH \nHM \nMHM \nHM \nHM \n+ \n+ \n\u2013 \n+ \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n+ \nAbkhaz \nArapesh \nBabungo \nBambara \nBasque \nBurushaski \nGeorgian \nHittite \nHungarian \nItelmen \nJapanese \nNama \nNgalakan \nPolish \nKoasati \nNasioi \nPaiwan \nPipil \nSumerian \n4 \n4 \n4 \n4 \n4 \n4 \n4 \n4 \n4 \n4 \n4 \n4 \n4 \n4 \n4\/5 \n4\/5 \n4\/5 \n4\/5 \n4\/5 \n3 \n2 \n2 \n3 \n3 \n3 \n2\/3 \n3 \n2\/3 \n2\/3 \n3 \n3 \n1\/2 \n2 \n3 \n3 \n1 \n1 \n3 \n\u2013 \n+ \n+ \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n+ \n\u2013 \n+ \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n+ \n\u2013 \nirr \nirr \nirr \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \nirr \n\u2013 \nirr \nirr \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n+ \n\u2013 \nirr \nHM \nMHM \nHM \nHM \nHM \nMH \nMH \nMHM \nMH \nMHM \nMH \nMH \nHM \nMHM \nHM \nHM \nHM \nMH \nHM \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n+ \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n+ \n\u2013 \n+ \n\u2013 \n+ \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \nMH \nMHM \nHM \nHM \nMH \nMH \nMH \nMH \nMH \nMH \nMH \nMH \nMH \nMHM \nMHM \nMH \nHM \nMH \nMH \n+ \n\u2013 \n+ \n+ \n+ \n\u2013 \n+ \n+ \n+ \n+ \n+ \n+ \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n+ \n+ \n\u2013 \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \nAlamblak \nBerbice Dutch \nGuaran\u00ed \nKayardild \nKisi \nOromo \nWambon \nMandarin Chinese  \nGaro \nGude \nNung \nTamil \nWest Greenlandic \n5 \n5 \n5 \n5 \n5 \n5 \n5 \n5\/6 \n5\/6 \n5\/6 \n5\/6 \n5\/6 \n5\/6 \n3 \n2 \n2 \n1\/2\/3 \n2\/3 \n3 \n3 \n2 \n3 \n1\/2 \n2 \n3 \n3 \n\u2013 \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n+ \n+ \n+ \n+ \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \nirr \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \nMHM \nMH \nHM \nMH \nHM \nHM \nHM \nMH \nHM \nMH \nHM \nMH \nHM \n\u2013 \n+ \n+ \n\u2013 \n+ \n+ \n+ \n+ \n+ \n+ \n+ \n+ \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nHixkaryana \nKrongo \nNavaho \nNivkh \nNunggubuyu \nTuscarora \n6 \n6 \n6 \n6 \n6 \n6\/7 \n2 \n1\/2 \n3 \n3 \n1\/2\/3 \n2 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n+ \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \nirr \nirr \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nirr \nTable 4\nParts-of-speech systems and word order\n[20] In connection with the correlation observed it is worth noting that the two language\nfamilies showing the largest number of languages with an extremely flexible parts-of-speech\nsystem, Polynesian and Salish, are consistently predicate-initial.\nP A R T S- O F- S P E E C H S Y S T E M S A N D W O R D O R D E R\n549\n5.2.2 Word order variation at the clause level\nA second way of looking at word order at the clause level in view of the\nabsence of a verb\/non-verb distinction concerns the question to what extent\nlanguages display deviant ordering patterns. The expectation is that flexible\nlanguages of types 1\u20131\/2 will be more reluctant to allow such deviation,\nbecause any deviation from the basic pattern can lead to functional ambi-\nguity as regards the identification of predicate and referential phrases. Since\nthe number of referential phrases in argument position may differ, we\nconsider here only the deviations in order between subject and predicate\nphrase.\nThe upper part of column 2 in table 4 shows us that two out of the three\nlanguages of type 1 and 1\/2 actually do allow variation in the ordering of\nsubject and predicate phrase. But column 3 shows that \u2013 as predicted by our\ngeneral hypothesis (see section 5.1) \u2013 these languages solve the problem\nof the potential functional ambiguity arising from an alternative order by\ninserting special morphological markers in the non-basic ordering patterns,\nrather than by the ordering patterns themselves.\nIn Samoan, a predicate-initial language with a parts-of-speech system of\ntype 1, placement of any referential phrase in sentence-initial position, before\nthe predicate phrase, is accompanied by the addition of the presentative\nparticle \u2018o, as illustrated in (27). The basic order is illustrated in (26).\nSamoan (Mosel & Hovdhaugen 1992: 52, 56)\n(26) \u2018Ua o\u00af tamaiti i Apia.\nPERF go children LD Apia\n\u2018The children have gone to Apia. \u2019\n(27) \u2018O le maile sa\u00af fasi e le teine.\nPRES ART dog PAST hit ERG ART girl\n\u2018The dog was hit by the girl. \u2019\nIn Tagalog, another predicate-initial language of type 1, it is the predicate\nrather than the preposed constituent that is obligatorily marked in cases of\ninversion. Example (29) shows the use of the predicate marker ay, which is\nabsent when the predicate is in initial position, as in (28).\nTagalog (Himmelmann forthcoming b)\n(28) Ma-sara\u00b4p ang pag-kain.\nSTAT-satisfaction SPEC GER-eating\n\u2018The food was good.\u2019\n(29) Sila\u00b4 mag-ina\u00b4 ay na-ulog na.\n3.PL RCP-mother PM REAL.STAT-sleep now\n\u2018The mother and her daughter fell asleep. \u2019\nWe may contrast the situation obtaining in Samoan and Tagalog with\nthe placement of the subject before the predicate phrase in Pipil, a\nK.

In this\nlanguage, the subject may be emphasized by being placed in sentence-initial\nposition. As a comparison of (30) and (31) shows, preposing of the subject\ndoes not require any additional morphological marking in Pipil.\nPipil (Campbell 1985: 103, 104)\n(30) \u00f8-ki-miktih ne wa:kax ne ta:ka-t.\n3.SG.SBJ-3.SG.OBJ-kill DEF cow DEF man\n\u2018The man killed the cow.\u2019\n(31) Ne i-siwa:-w \u00f8-ki-miktih.\nART 3.SG.POSS-wife-POSS 3.SG.SBJ-3.SG.OBJ-kill\nne chumpipi.\nDEF turkey\n\u2018His wife killed the turkey. \u2019\nIn the previous section we showed that our predictions concerning basic\nword order in languages of type 1 and 1\/2 do in fact hold for languages up\nto and including type 2\/3. The same seems to be true of our predictions\nconcerning word order variation, now up to and including type 3\/4. The\nupper part of column 2 in table 4 shows that the remaining languages of these\ntypes do not allow word order variation, with the exception of Imbabura\nQuechua. This language, however, applies a morphological disambiguating\nstrategy too. In Imbabura Quechua, a predicate-final language with a parts-\nof-speech system of type 2, placement of the subject after the predicate\nphrase is accompanied by the obligatory addition of the topic marker -ka, as\nshown in (33). The basic order is shown in (32).\nImbabura Quechua (Cole 1982: 70, 71)\n(32) Juan chagra-ta trabaja-ju-n.\nJuan field-ACC work-PROGR-3\n\u2018Juan is working in the field. \u2019\n(33) Jatun wasi-ta chari-n Marya-ka\/*Marya.\nbig house-ACC have-3 Maria-TOP\/Maria\n\u2018Maria has a big house. \u2019\nThis may be compared to the placement of the subject after the predicate\nphrase in Basque, another predicate-final language, but one with a parts-\nof-speech system of type 4. Basic order in Basque is illustrated in (34).\nExample (35) shows that no additional morphological marking is needed\nwhen the subject is postposed.21\n[21] Note that Basque is morphologically ergative but syntactically accusative (Saltarelli 1988:\nxiii).\nP A R T S- O F- S P E E C H S Y S T E M S A N D W O R D O R D E R\n551\nBasque (Saltarelli 1988: 67)\n(34) Aita-k ama-ri gona gorri-a\nfather-SG.ERG mother-SG.DAT skirt red-SG.ABS\nerosi d-\u00f8-io-\u00f8.\nbuy 3.ABS-PRS.AUX-3.SG.DAT-3.SG.ERG\n\u2018Father has bought a red skirt for mother. \u2019\n(35) Gona gorria erosi d-\u00f8-io-\u00f8\nskirt red-SG.ABS buy 3.ABS-PRS.AUX-3.SG.DAT-3.SG.ERG\nama-ri aita-k.\nmother-SG.DAT father-SG.ERG\n\u2018Father has bought a red skirt for mother. \u2019\nThese examples reveal that flexible languages which do not use word order\nto unambiguously signal the position of the predicate phrase within the sen-\ntence use morphological means to fulfil the same disambiguating function.\nThis is strong confirmation for our general hypothesis, which claims that the\nabsence of lexical specialization requires syntactic or morphological marking\nof syntactic slots. In the presence of lexical specialization, these syntactic\nslots would have been identifiable on the basis of lexical information. The\ndata in table 4, combined with the observations on the languages that at first\nsight seemed to be counterexamples, i.e. Samoan, Tagalog and Quechua,\nlead us to the generalization that languages with parts-of-speech systems\n1\u20133\/4 do not allow variation in the ordering of subject and predicate phrase,\nunless the deviation of the basic word order pattern is marked by morpho-\nlogical means. This is in sharp contrast with the situation obtaining in\nlanguages of types 4\u20136\/7 : 22 out of the 38 languages of these types do allow\nword order variation between subject and predicate without marking the\ndeviation of the basic word order pattern by morphological means.\nNote that our hypothesis does not predict the reverse, i.e. it does not\nexclude the existence of languages which do not have a flexible parts-\nof-speech system, but which do have a basic clause-initial or clause-final\norder and a fixed order of subject and predicate, or a morphological marker\nof a deviant order. For instance, Bambara, which has a parts-of-speech\nsystem of type 4, is predicate-final and does not allow alternations in the\norder of subject and predicate; Paiwan, which has a parts-of-speech system\nof type 4\/5, is predicate-initial and uses a morphological marker when the\norder of subject and predicate deviates from the basic pattern.\nIt is noteworthy that, as in the case of basic word order at the clause level,\nour generalization with respect to word order variation extends over a wider\nrange of languages (1\u20133\/4) than predicted (1\u20131\/2). An explanation of these\nfacts is that we define our generalizations in terms of the position of the\npredicate, irrespective of the lexical class of the predicate. Earlier research\n(Hengeveld 1992b) has revealed, however, that the more flexible the parts-of-\nspeech system of a language is, the higher the extent to which various classes\nK.

Consider in this respect the following Turkish examples :\nTurkish (Lewis 1967)\n(36) Yol uzun.\nroad long\n\u2018The road is long. \u2019\n(37) uzun yol\nlong road\n\u2018the long road\u2019\nTurkish has a parts-of-speech system of type 2\/3. In Turkish, as in most\nlanguages of types 1\u20133\/4, bare nominal stems may be used predicatively,\nwhich introduces a further potential functional ambiguity in the grammar as\nregards the identification of predicate phrases and referential phrases. Fixed\nword order patterns and\/or morphological marking by means of copulas,\nfor example, help to solve this problem of functional ambiguity.\n5.3 The noun\/modifier distinction: word order variation within\nreferential phrases\nIn flexible languages without a separate class of nouns (types 1\u20132\/3), the po-\ntential functional ambiguity arising from the nature of their parts-of-speech\nsystem concerns the interpretation of a lexical element as a head or a modifier\nwithin a referential phrase, since the interpretation of a non-verb as the head\nor a modifier of a referential phrase may interfere with its potential in-\nterpretation as the head or a modifier of the same or a contiguous referential\nphrase. We therefore predict that the order of head and modifier in referential\nphrases is fixed, unless there is a special morphological procedure which\nuniquely identifies the head-modifier relation within the referential phrase.\nThe upper parts of columns 4 and 5 in table 4 show that one out of the\nseven languages of types 1\u20132\/3, Tagalog, actually does allow variation in the\nordering of head and modifier within the referential phrase. However \u2013 as\npredicted by our general hypothesis \u2013 the problem of functional ambiguity is\nsolved in this language by morphological means, as shown in column 6. Since\nhead and modifier of referential phrases are linked to each other through a\nspecial morphological marker, it is always clear which elements go together\nwithin a referential phrase. Compare the following examples:\nTagalog (Himmelman forthcoming a: 5)\n(38) ulo\u00b4l na unggo\u00b4\nfoolish LNK monkey\n\u2018foolish monkey\u2019\n(39) unggo\u00b4=ng ulo\u00b4l\nmonkey=LNK foolish\n\u2018foolish monkey\u2019\nP A R T S- O F- S P E E C H S Y S T E M S A N D W O R D O R D E R\n553\nGiven that Tagalog is a language with a parts-of-speech system of type\n1, and therefore does not make a distinction between nouns on the one\nhand and modifiers or adjectives on the other, it is hard to say whether\nexample (38) should be glossed as \u2018 foolish monkey\u2019 or as \u2018monkey\nfool \u2019, and the same goes for (39). But whatever the analysis, the fact\nthat the linker na\/ng22 always occurs in between head and modifier en-\nsures that the two are interpreted as being part of the same referential\nphrase.\nIt is worth noting that the generalization has a somewhat wider scope\nagain: it applies to languages with a parts-of-speech system up to type 3\/4.\nNone of these languages allows word order freedom within the noun phrase\nwithout morphological marking. This may be contrasted with the situation\nin Itelmen, for example. In this language, with a parts-of-speech system of\ntype 4, a modifier may occur on either side of the head, as in Tagalog.\nHowever, it may do so in the absence of additional morphological pro-\ncedures, witness the following examples:\nItelmen (Georg & Volodin 1999: 108f.)\n(40) qe?m xplah\nmine big\n\u2018big mine\u2019\n(41) xplah massu\nbig bear\n\u2018big bear\u2019\nIn fact, while variation in the order of head and modifier within referential\nphrases without morphological marking is not found in languages of types\n1\u20133\/4, it is abundant in languages of types 4\u20135\/6 : in 13 of the 32 languages\nbelonging to these types, the modifier does not have a fixed position in the\nabsence of a morphological strategy. Furthermore, all 13 languages fall\nwithin types 4\u20135, i.e. they are languages with an open class of true adjectives.\nIf we restrict ourselves to these types, then the proportion of languages rises\nto 50%: 13 out of the 26 languages of types 4\u20135 do show flexibility in the\norder of heads and modifiers within referential phrases, and do not use\nadditional morphological strategies. We will return to this remarkable fact\nin section 6.4.\nNote that, conversely, our hypothesis does not predict that there should\nnot be languages that do not have a flexible parts-of-speech system, but\nwhich do use a morphological marker of attribution even in the absence of\nword order freedom within the referential phrase. In our sample, Lango,\nBambara and Kisi are cases in point.\n[22] The different forms of the linker are phonologically conditioned.\nK. H E N G E V E L D, J. R I J K H OFF & A. S I E W I E R S K A\n554\n5.4 The adjective\/manner adverb distinction\n5.4.1 Basic word order in the predicate phrase\nIn languages without a specialized class of adverbs (1\u20133\/4), the interpretation\nof a lexical element as a modifier of the predicate phrase may interfere either\nwith its potential interpretation as the head of that same predicate phrase\nor with its interpretation as a lexical modifier of a contiguous referential\nphrase. The latter issue will be discussed in section 5.4.2. Here, we first\ndiscuss potential functional ambiguity within the predicate phrase.\nWe observed in section 5.2.2 that the ordering possibilities in languages\nwith parts-of-speech systems of types 1\u20133\/4 are restricted by the fact that\nall classes of lexemes may be used predicatively. As a result, in this type of\nlanguage, the lexical modifier of a predicate should preferably not occur in\na position in which it might be interpreted as the head of the predicate\nphrase. Thus, we arrive at the following predictions :\n(i) In predicate-final languages with HM order in predicate phrases,\nthe modifier of the predicate phrase appears in a position in which it\nmight be interpreted as the main predicate. Since this leads to potential\nfunctional ambiguity in languages with parts-of-speech systems 1\u20133\/4,\nHM order in predicate phrases is not expected to occur in these\nlanguages, unless the potential ambiguity is resolved by morphological\nmeans.\n(ii) In predicate-initial languages with MH order in predicate phrases,\nthe modifier of the predicate phrase appears in a position in which\nit might be interpreted as the predicate. Since this leads to potential\nfunctional ambiguity in languages with parts-of-speech systems 1\u20133\/4,\nMH order in predicate phrases is not expected to occur in these\nlanguages, unless the potential ambiguity is resolved by morphological\nmeans.\n(iii) In predicate-medial languages the modifier of the predicate phrase may\nalways appear in a position in which it might be interpreted as the\npredicate, irrespective of the order of head and modifier in predicate\nphrases. HM order, MH order, or both orders may, therefore, be\nexpected to occur in predicate-medial languages, including those with\nparts-of-speech systems 1\u20133\/4. Columns 7 and 8 in table 4 show that this\nis correct for all languages of types 1\u20133\/4 in the sample.\nThe problem of potential functional ambiguity in predicate-medial\nlanguages is generally resolved by morphological means other than the\nuniquely identifying ones that we have concentrated on so far. Thus, Lango\ninflects potential modifiers when used predicatively, Ngiti makes use of an\nobligatory copula, and Miao and Tidore use some tense\/mood\/aspect and\/or\nperson markers with potential modifiers used predicatively. Since in the case\nof the latter two languages these markers are not obligatorily present, these\nP A R T S- O F- S P E E C H S Y S T E M S A N D W O R D O R D E R\n555\nlanguages seem to allow some functional ambiguity, as in the following\nexample from Miao:\nMiao (Harriehausen 1990: 147f.)\n(42) daim tiab dawb\nCL skirt white\n\u2018 the white skirt \u2019 or \u2018The skirt is white. \u2019\nIt might be that in this case prosodic differences help disambiguate the two\nreadings (see note 18).\n5.4.2 Basic word order in referential phrases\nIn flexible languages that do not make a distinction between adjectives\nand manner adverbs (types 1\u20133\/4), a further potential functional ambi-\nguity arising from their parts-of-speech system concerns the fact that\nthe interpretation of a lexical element as a modifier within a referential\nphrase may interfere with its potential interpretation as a modifier within\na predicate phrase. Since, as we showed in the previous section, the\nposition of the modifier is, at least partly, determined by the fact that it\nmay be mistaken for the predicate, the question now is what the conse-\nquences of this are for the position of the modifier within the referential\nphrase.\nThe difficulty of distinguishing between the use of a lexical element as a\nmodifier of the referential phrase or of the predicate phrase in languages of\ntypes 1\u20133\/4 leads to a number of predictions concerning basic word order at\nthe level of the referential phrase. With respect to these orders, the following\npredictions may be formulated:\n(i) In predicate-final languages with HM order in referential phrases, the\nmodifier of the referential phrase appears in a position contiguous\nto the modifier slot of the (MH) predicate phrase. Since this leads to\npotential functional ambiguity in languages with parts-of-speech\nsystems 1\u20133\/4, HM order in referential phrases is not expected to occur\nin these languages. This is represented schematically, and illustrated by\nmeans of pseudo-English examples, in (43).\nPredicate-final languages\n(43) (a) (MRefPhr HRefPhr ) (MPrPhr HPrPhr)\n(beautiful girl ) ( dance )\n\u2018The beautiful girl danced. \u2019\n(b) *(HRefPhr MRefPhr ) (MPrPhr HPrPhr )\n(girl beautiful) ( dance )\n\u2018The beautiful girl danced. \u2019\n(girl ) (beautiful dance)\n\u2018The girl danced beautifully. \u2019\nK. H E N G E V E L D, J. R I J K H OFF & A. S I E W I E R S K A\n556\n(ii) Similarly, in predicate-initial languages with MH order in referential\nphrases, the modifier of the referential phrase appears in a position\ncontiguous to the modifier slot of the (HM) predicate phrase. Since this,\nagain, leads to potential functional ambiguity in languages with parts-\nof-speech systems 1\u20133\/4, MH order in referential phrases is not expected\nto occur in these languages. This is illustrated in (44).\nPredicate-initial languages\n(44) (a) (HPrPhr MPrPhr ) (HRefPhr MRefPhr )\n(dance ) (girl beautiful )\n\u2018The beautiful girl danced. \u2019\n(b) *(HPrPhr MPrPhr ) (MRefPhr HRefPhr)\n(dance beautiful) ( girl )\n\u2018The girl danced beautifully. \u2019\n(dance ) (beautiful girl )\n\u2018The beautiful girl danced. \u2019\n(iii) In predicate-medial languages, the modifier of the referential phrase\nappears in a position contiguous to the modifier slot when the order of\nhead and modifier within referential phrases is the inverse of the order of\nhead and modifier within predicate phrases. Since this, again, leads\nto potential functional ambiguity in languages with parts-of-speech\nsystems 1\u20133\/4, the ordering of head and modifier within referential and\npredicate phrases is expected to be identical in these languages. This is\nillustrated in (45) and (46).\nPredicate-medial languages\n(45) (a) (HRefPhr MRefPhr ) (HPrPhr MPrPhr ) (HRefPhr MRefPhr )\n(girl beautiful) (sing ) (song nice )\n\u2018The beautiful girl sang a nice song. \u2019\n(b) *(MRefPhr HRefPhr ) (HPrPhr MPrPhr ) (MRefPhr HRefPhr )\n(beautiful girl ) (sing nice ) ( song )\n\u2018The beautiful girl sang a song nicely. \u2019\n(beautiful girl ) (sing ) (nice song )\n\u2018The beautiful girl sang a nice song. \u2019\n(46) (a) (MRefPhr HRefPhr ) (MPrPhr HPrPhr ) (MRefPhr HRefPhr )\n(beautiful girl ) ( sing ) (nice song )\n\u2018The beautiful girl sang a nice song. \u2019\n(b) *(HRefPhr MRefPhr) (MPrPhr HPrPhr ) (HRefPhr MRefPhr )\n(girl beautiful) ( sing ) (song nice )\n\u2018The beautiful girl sang a nice song. \u2019\n(girl ) (beautiful sing ) (song nice )\n\u2018The girl sang a nice song beautifully. \u2019\nSummarizing the predictions, we expect that within the group of languages\nof types 1\u20133\/4, MH order in referential phrases is strongly preferred in\nP A R T S- O F- S P E E C H S Y S T E M S A N D W O R D O R D E R\n557\npredicate-final languages, HM order in predicate-initial languages, and\nconsistent MH or HM order across referential and predicate phrases in\npredicate-medial languages. The data in the upper part of column 4 in table 4\nappear to show that there are three counterexamples to these expectations,\nnamely Tagalog, Warao and Ngiti.\nTagalog is not a real counterexample, since as stated in section 3.4, this\nlanguage lacks a modifier slot within the predicate phrase, so that there is\nnever potential functional ambiguity with the modifier of referential phrases.\nWarao is a predicate-final language with a parts-of-speech system of type\n2, which nevertheless has HM order in referential phrases,23 as shown in (47)\nand (48).\nWarao (Vaquero 1965: 143, 50)\n(47) Arubuko ine obono-ya.\nbread I want-PRS\n\u2018I want bread. \u2019\n(48) noboto sanuka\nchild small\n\u2018 small child\u2019\nHowever, as indicated in column 9 in table 4, the problem of distinguishing\nbetween the interpretation of a lexical element as a modifier of the referential\nphrase or as a modifier of the predicate phrase is solved in Warao by the\npossibility of turning the lexical element in its manner reading into the head\nof a noun phrase provided with the postposition tane \u2018manner\u2019, thus re-\nsolving the problem of functional ambiguity raised by the ordering patterns.\nCompare (49) and (50).\nWarao (Romero-Figeroa 1997: 119, 71)\n(49) Oko kuana yaota-te arone yakera nahoro-te_\nwe hardness work-NPAST although beauty eat-NPAST\n\u2018Although we work hard and eat well,_. \u2019\n(50) Ma-ha eku ine yakera tane uba-te.\n1.SG-POSS inside I beauty MANNER sleep-NPAST\n\u2018I sleep very well in my hammock.\u2019\nIf this morphological solution to the problem of solving functional\nambiguity is taken into account, Warao is not an exception to our general-\nization.\nNgiti has both predicate-medial and predicate-final order. In this\nlanguage, the manner constituent occupies a special sentence-initial or\n[23] Interestingly, Warao is also the only language within the group of flexible languages in\nwhich the object precedes the subject.\nK. H E N G E V E L D, J. R I J K H OFF & A. S I E W I E R S K A\n558\nsentence-final position, used for adjuncts and adpositional phrases in\ngeneral. Thus the manner constituent does not necessarily form a single\ncontiguous phrase with the main predicate, as in the other languages\nconsidered so far. These two special positions at the sentence margins\noffer sufficient possibilities for avoiding functional ambiguity, particularly\nsince the order of head and lexical modifier within the referential phrase is\nfixed.\nBy contrast, as can be seen in table 4, in languages with parts-of-speech\nsystems 4 and 4\/5 \u2013 i.e. the remaining languages with lexical modifiers at\nboth the referential phrase and the predicate phrase levels \u2013 the word-order\ncombinations avoided in languages of types 1\u20133\/4 are in fact more numerous\nthan the other combinations. Within the large group of predicate-final\nlanguages with parts-of-speech systems 4 and 4\/5, Abkhaz, Basque, Hittite,\nKoasati, Nasioi and Sumerian all have HM as their basic word order or\nas one of their basic word orders in referential phrases without any\nadditional morphological marking, whereas only Burushaski, Japanese and\nNama have MH basic word order in referential phrases. The only predicate-\ninitial language with a parts-of-speech system of types 4\u20134\/5, Pipil, uses\nMH order in referential phrases, which again is the order that would be\navoided in a language with parts-of-speech systems 1\u20133\/4. Two of the three\npredicate-medial languages with a parts-of-speech system of types 4\u20134\/5,\nArapesh and Polish, do not have a consistent identical ordering of heads and\nmodifiers in referential and predicate phrases, whereas only one, Babungo,\ndoes.\nAll these facts are strong confirmation of our hypothesis that the order-\ning of heads and modifiers within referential and predicate phrases is\nstrongly determined by the parts-of speech systems of the languages in-\nvolved.\n5.5 Summary\nThe preceding sections have demonstrated that there is a clear connection\nbetween the parts-of-speech system of a language and restrictions on word\norder within that language. Our general hypothesis \u2013 that languages need\nsyntactic and morphological means to mark syntactic slots in those cases in\nwhich disambiguation through lexical specialization is absent \u2013 is confirmed.\nFlexible languages exhibit severe restrictions on their word order possi-\nbilities. In those cases in which these restrictions seem to be violated, mor-\nphological marking fulfils the same disambiguating function. This suggests\nthat lexical typology may fruitfully supplement the results achieved in syn-\ntactic and morphological typology. In the next section we will elaborate\nthis point one step further by showing how our results throw new light on\nvarious findings in the earlier typological literature, concentrating again\non word order.\nP A R T S- O F- S P E E C H S Y S T E M S A N D W O R D O R D E R\n559\n6. EA R L I E R T Y P O L O G I C A L W O R K\n6.1 Introduction\nOur findings supplement earlier typological work on word order in that they\nhelp to refine existing universals, disprove some earlier claims and lead to\nalternative explanations for linguistic phenomena. We will illustrate this by\nlooking at the relation between verb\u2013object and noun\u2013adjective order, in\nsection 6.2, the distribution of basic word orders, in section 6.3, and adjective\ndoubling, in section 6.4.\n6.2 The relation between verb\u2013object and noun\u2013adjective order\nA number of the word order universals suggested by Greenberg (1966) sub-\nsequently gave rise to the notion of consistent ordering (also referred to\nas Natural Serialization and The Head Parameter), i.e. a preference for\nlanguages to display either HM or MH order across all head\/modifier\npairs. The basic diagnostic of the HM or MH status of a language was taken\nto be the location of the object relative to the verb. Although originally\nadjectives were assumed to pattern like other modifiers, favouring AN order\nin OV languages and NA order in VO, Dryer (1988: 191; 1992: 95) laid waste\nto this assumption by showing that there was no correlation between\nthe location of the object relative to the verb and the adjective relative to the\nnoun. Our data suggest that Dryer\u2019s refutation of the correlation in question\nmay not be fully justified. While overall the location of the object relative\nto the verb is not a good predictor of the location of the lexical modifier\nrelative to the head in referential phrases, there is a subset of languages for\nwhich a clear correlation between the two can be discerned. In languages\nwith parts-of-speech systems 1\u20133\/4, predicate-initial order strongly correlates\nwith HM order and predicate-final order with MH in referential phrases\nwith a lexical modifier. Significantly, predicate-medial languages are not\ninvolved in this correlation, which vindicates Greenberg\u2019s original universal\nformulated with respect to SOV and VSO languages and not OV as opposed\nto VO ones. Thus our parts-of speech typology rehabilitates a correlation,\nbe it in a somewhat modified form.\n6.3 The distribution of basic word orders\nOn the basis of a sample containing over a thousand languages, Tomlin\n(1986) found that languages were distributed over the six possible orderings\nof verb (V),24 subject (S) and object (O) in the following way:\n(51) SOV SVO VSO VOS OVS OSV\n44.78% 41.79% 9.20% 2.99% 1.24% 0%\n[24] Note that we use the term \u2018verb\u2019 rather than \u2018predicate\u2019, the term which we would prefer, in\naccordance with the terminology used in the sources we are discussing here.\nK. H E N G E V E L D, J. R I J K H OFF & A. S I E W I E R S K A\n560\nTomlin argued that the difference in distribution reflects the interaction\nof three general ordering principles : (i) the Theme (read: subject) First\nPrinciple, (ii) Verb-Object Bonding (_OV_ or_VO_), and (iii) the\nAnimated First Principle. Since SOV languages adhere to all three principles,\nthey are most frequent. Conversely, OSV languages violate the three prin-\nciples and are for that reason extremely rare (see e.g. Derbyshire & Pullum\n1981) and \u2013 in Tomlin\u2019s sample \u2013 unattested. Hawkins (1994: 331\u2013339), in\nturn, attributes the above distribution of basic orders to relative ease of\nprocessing. The algorithm which he has devised for calculating processing\nease, the Early Immediate Constituent recognition algorithm (EIC), identi-\nfies SOV as the most optimal order in terms of processing efficiency for\nan OV language, and SVO order as the most optimal for a VO language.\nFurther, it predicts that the two orders should be grammaticalized, in the\nunmarked case, \u2018at the expense of all other orders \u2019 (Hawkins 1994: 337). As\nTomlin\u2019s data show, while this prediction fares rather well in relation to\nthe remaining two OV orders, it is somewhat less successful in regard to the\nremaining two VO ones. Although languages with verb-initial order are\nundoubtedly less frequent than the ones with verb-final order, they definitely\ndo occur, and in some areas of the world even with high frequency. What,\nthen, is the motivation for the grammaticalization of either of the two verb-\ninitial orders? Hawkins\u2019 EIC has no explanation to offer in this connection.\nThe EIC identifies VSO as the only viable alternative to SVO in terms of ease\nof processing. Nonetheless, as SVO is always more efficient, it remains a\nmystery why VSO should ever be selected. Our investigation suggests that\none of the factors underlying this choice is the parts-of-speech system of\na language.\nWe have shown that languages with highly flexible parts-of-speech systems\ndo not have verb-medial order, which \u2013 in our sample \u2013 means either OVS\n(Hixkaryana) or SVO. Our explanation for the absence of such order in\nflexible parts-of-speech system languages is that in verb-medial languages the\npredicate is not uniquely identifiable in terms of its location: in intransitive\nclauses it is final, in transitive medial, and in pro-drop languages often initial.\nConsequently, word order cannot be employed to determine whether a given\nlexeme is or is not being used as a predicate. As this cannot be established\non the basis of the lexeme itself, the burden of doing so would fall on mor-\nphological marking. However, subjects in SVO languages are rather unlikely\nto be morphologically marked. First of all, SVO languages lack nominal case\nmarking more often than, for example, SOV languages (see e.g. Siewierska\n1996 and the references therein). And secondly, in those SVO languages\nthat do display case marking, it is generally the object rather than the subject\nwhich has an overt marker. Therefore, unless the predicate bears special\nmarking, which of the lexemes is the S and which the predicate will not be\nimmediately clear. Basic verb-initial order avoids these problems of identi-\nfication; the predicate is uniquely identifiable in terms of its initial location.\nP A R T S- O F- S P E E C H S Y S T E M S A N D W O R D O R D E R\n561\nIn the light of the above, the question arises why all languages with a\nflexible parts-of-speech system are not predicate-initial. If predicate-initial\norder is such a successful strategy for identifying the function of a lexically\nunderspecified lexeme, might we not expect it to be favoured over predi-\ncate-final order? The answer is no. As a predicate-identifying strategy,\npredicate-final order is just as good as predicate-initial. What is at issue is\nconsistency. If the predicate is always clause-final, there is no reason why\nan unmarked clause-initial lexeme should be misinterpreted as a predicate.\nIn transitive clauses, however, there is a potential danger of interpreting\nthe object as the (intransitive) predicate. We would therefore expect\npredicate-final languages with a flexible parts-of-speech system to be par-\nticularly likely to display overt morphological case marking of the object\nor verbal agreement marking, or both. All the relevant languages in the\nsample do so.\nIt needs to be mentioned that the fact that predicate-initial and predicate-\nfinal orders are equally good identifying predicate strategies as far as flexible\nparts-of-speech system languages are concerned finds indirect support from\nHawkins\u2019 (2002) more recent work on the relationship between dependency\nstrength and linear precedence. Hawkins argues that the dependency re-\nlations between a dependent and an independent category may differ in\nstrength, as a function of both the formal and the semantic properties\nthat are assigned by the independent category to the dependent one. The\nstrongest dependency relations involve filler-gap dependencies, as in wh-\nquestions or zero-marked relative clauses. These he calls full addition\ndependencies. Slightly weaker are partial addition dependencies, such as\nthose obtaining between a reflexive pronoun and its clausal antecedent.\nWeaker still are dependencies involving the reduction in the semantic or\nsyntactic range of a dependent category by the independent one, called range\nreduction. Included among such dependencies are case marking and sem-\nantic role assignment, and \u2013 crucially for us \u2013 polysemy and ambiguity re-\nduction in functional categories and parts of speech. According to Hawkins,\nstrong dependencies favour placing the independent category before the\ndependent one. Weaker dependencies or more symmetrical dependencies\nallow for either order. In languages with a flexible parts-of-speech system,\nas in any other language, it is the predicate which determines the semantic\nrole and (to a certain extent) the case marking of its arguments. However, the\npredicate is also dependent on the non-predicate lexemes for its identification\nas the predicate. Thus, flexible lexemes enter into symmetrical dependency\nrelations (with respect to different properties) with each other, even more\nso than in non-flexible languages. As the dependencies go in both directions,\nand involve range reduction, they are weak, in the sense defined above.\nTherefore, there should be no preference for positioning the more indepen-\ndent category before the more dependent one. Given the overall cross-\nlinguistic dominance of predicate-final orders, the fact that among the few\nK. H E N G E V E L D, J. R I J K H OFF & A. S I E W I E R S K A\n562\nflexible languages there are predicate-initial ones as well as predicate-final\nones bears out this prediction.\n6.4 Doubling\nDoubling refers to the placement of lexical modifiers in referential phrases\nboth before and after the head. Although doubling is widely attested, it\nhas proved to be very difficult to formulate valid generalizations with re-\nspect to the circumstances in which it tends to occur. An early observation by\nGreenberg (1966) with respect to the doubling of adjectives is his Universal 19.\n(52) Universal 19\nWhen the general rule is that the descriptive adjective follows, there\nmay be a minority of adjectives which usually precede, but when the\ngeneral rule is that descriptive adjectives precede, there are no excep-\ntions.\nIn his study on word order universals, Hawkins (1983) tried to explain\ndoubling in terms of his Doubling Hypothesis, which says that doubling only\noccurs in adjacent subtypes as defined by his Prepositional and Postposi-\ntional Noun Modifier Hierarchy. For example, the Prepositional Noun\nModifier Hierarchy (PrNMH) in (53) permits the co-occurrences in (54)\n(Hawkins 1983: 75f.) :\n(53) Prep\u0001 ((NDem\u0001NNum\u0001NA) & (NA\u0001NG) & (NG\u0001NRel))\n(54) (a) Prep & NDem & NNum & NA & NG & NRel\n(b1) Prep & DemN & NNum & NA & NG & NRel\n(b2) Prep & NDem & NumN & NA & NG & NRel\n(c) Prep & DemN & NumN & NA & NG & NRel\n(d) Prep & DemN & NumN & AN & NG & NRel\n(e) Prep & DemN & NumN & AN & GN & NRel\n(f) Prep & DemN & NumN & AN & GN & RelN\nThe PrNMH predicts that doubling of adjectives only occurs in languages\nof subtypes c. and d. in the co-occurrences listed in (54).25 However, Hawkins\n(1983: 76f., 87) also encountered various exceptions to the Doubling\nHypothesis in his sample, some of which he attributed to historical processes\nin that he claimed that certain occurrences of non-adjacent doubling are\nthe result of \u2018various idiosyncratic and language particular factors [which]\ncan retard the loss of some word order\u2019 (p. 77).\nAs we have shown (in section 5.3), doubling is more favoured in flexible\nlanguages in which the adjective is not a clearly differentiated part of speech,\ni.e. in languages of types 1\u20133\/4. In these languages, doubling of lexical\n[25] Note that type (54d) would be excluded by Greenberg\u2019s Universal 19.\nP A R T S- O F- S P E E C H S Y S T E M S A N D W O R D O R D E R\n563\nmodifiers in referential phrases, i.e. the occurrence of lexical modifiers both\nbefore and after the head, is impossible. The only exception is Tagalog, for\nthe reasons given in sections 3.4 and 5.4.2. Thus, we are now in a position to\noffer an alternative explanation: doubling is only allowed in those languages\nin which the adjective is a clearly differentiated part-of-speech, i.e. in\nlanguages with parts of-speech systems 4\u20135\/6. Table 4 shows clearly that\nthis is the case.\n7. CO N C L U S I O N\nIn this article we have shown that the nature of the parts-of-speech system of\na language imposes restrictions on the syntactic properties of that language,\nwhich can be explained in terms of their disambiguating function. We have\nalso shown that in those cases in which languages display unpredicted syn-\ntactic properties, they apply morphological solutions with the same dis-\nambiguating effect. Our findings furthermore have allowed us to propose a\nnumber of improvements to existing work in word order typology. The\nresults thus show that lexical typology is a necessary addition to existing\nwork on syntactic and morphological typology.\nREFERENCES\nA .
