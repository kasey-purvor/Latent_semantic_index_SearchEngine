INTRODUCTION \n \nBacteriorhodopsin (bR), isolated from the outer cell membrane of the bacterium Halobacterium salinarum [1], is the \nsimplest known ion pump, and one of the best-characterized membrane proteins. Upon illumination it transports protons \nacross the membrane, while undergoing a cyclic series of reactions with quasi-stable intermediate states (called the \nphotocycle) [2]: \nBR570 \u2192 K620 \u2192 L540\u2192M410 \u2192 N550 \u2192 O630 \u2192BR570 \nBR570 \u2192 K620 \u2192 L540\u2192M410 \u2192 N550 \u2192 O630 \u2192BR570 \nThe letters denote the ground and intermediate states, and the subscripts refer to the wavelengths\/nm of their absorption \nmaxima. The transition rates in dried bR films span from subpicoseconds to seconds. Gels and thin films containing \noriented bR molecules [3,4] are extremely stable, maintaining their photoelectric activity for several years at the same \nlevel. Despite the large variety of bioelectronic applications utilizing the favourable optical and photoelectric properties \nof bR and its mutants produced by genetic engineering [5], no report has yet been published about its application in \nintegrated optics (IO). IO is a new discipline of optoelectronics, which integrates various optomodules on a small \nsubstrate, in order to create analogues of integrated circuits [6]. Since the theory and measuring techniques for integrated \noptics are well established, the main limitations in developing new devices are of a technical nature, namely, in our case \nto find the proper NLO material for the particular application envisaged.

The light-induced change of refractive index of \na bR-containing film was indeed demonstrated earlier [7,8], though not kinetically resolved. This opens the way to a \nhighly interesting use of the NLO characteristics of bR namely for the modulation of the coupling of light into and out of \nIO devices controlled by the light-induced transitions of bR. \n \n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS \n \nBacteriorhodopsin-containing purple membranes were suspended in distilled water and dry bR-films of good optical \nquality were produced by layering the suspension on a smooth surface. Integrated optical experiments were carried out \nusing slab geometry waveguides (Microvacuum Ltd, Budapest), and Mach-Zehnder interferometers. \n2.1 Slab waveguide experiments \nThe slab waveguide consisted of a thin Si(Ti)O2 layer (refractive index nF\u22481.8, thickness dF\u2248200 nm) on a 16\u00d748 mm \nglass substrate (refractive index nS\u22481.5) surface. Coupling of light into the waveguide was achieved through a grating \nformed in the waveguide (line density: 1\/\u039b=2400 mm-1, length of the grating region: 1 mm). In a thin waveguide, only \nthe zeroth transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) light modes can propagate [9,10]. Since the guided \nmodes have a significant evanescent component, coupling to or from an external beam is strongly influenced by the \nrefractive index of the material above the grating area (the adlayer). Thus, a change of the index of refraction of bR \n(\u2206nA) will modulate the angle \u03b1 of  incoupling. \nWe determined the changes of incoupling angle during the bR photocycle initiated by a pulse from an excimer laser \npumped dye laser (Lambda Physik Lextra 100, Rhodamine 6G, \u03bb=580 nm, E=10 mJ\/pulse) or from a Nd:YAG laser \n(Continuum) equipped with a tunable optical parametric oscillator head (\u03bb=410 nm, 10 mJ pulse energy). \nThe waveguide was placed on a rotational stage (Ealing Electro Optics Digital Positioning System), by which the \ncoupling angle \u03b1 could be controlled to an accuracy of 10-4 deg. The incoupled light was measured at the ends of the \nwaveguide by a photomultiplier (Hamamatsu). The light intensity signal was amplified by a laboratory-built preamplifier \nand then recorded with a Le Croy 9310L transient digitizer. In order to improve the signal to noise ratio, the time \nresolution of the system was limited by low-pass filtering to 0.8 \u00b5s. \n2.2 Experiments with Mach-Zehnder interferometer  \nThe integrated Mach-Zehnder interferometer structure was constructed of polymerized NOA81 (Norland Product, Inc.) \noptical adhesive. First a 9 \u00b5m thick layer of the NOA81 was spincoated onto a glass cover slip. The layer on the cover \nslip was then taken to the motorized stage of an inverse microscope (Axiovert200, Zeiss). The beam of a Kr-ion laser \n(Innova 304, Coherent, 407 nm, 10 mW) was focused onto the layer by means of a 10X microscope objective. A \ncomputer-controlled shutter and the stepper motors of the microscope stage controlled the writing of a Mach-Zehnder \nstructure into the resin film. After the writing process was completed the non-exposed part (which is not hardened and \nstuck to the cover slip glass) was removed by acetone\/ethanol 3:1 mixture. The width of the hardened lines was 10 \u00b5m.  \nThe physical dimensions of the structure allowed incoupling the light directly from a single-mode optical fiber core (5 \n\u00b5m in diameter). For this reason, the optical fiber was placed and fixed close to the end face of the stripe, finally all parts \nwere fixed to a regular microscope slide that was used as a base plate of the structures (Figure 1A-D). \nA water suspension of pm (pH 6, OD 35) was layered on both arms of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer and dried at 25 \noC under a laminar flow for 3 hours. The relative humidity of the films was adjusted to be 50%. The transfer function of \nthe interferometer was measured under a microscope (see above). An optical fiber was fixed at the output of the \ninterferometer in order to guide the transmitted red light to a photomultiplier (Hamamatsu), and its signal was recorded \nby a digital storage oscilloscope (Le Croy). The beam of an Ar-ion laser (Stabilite2016, Spectraphysics) was used to \nexcite the bR (\u03bb =488 nm, 100 mW), while the measuring light was that of a diode laser (\u03bb= 676 nm, 8 mW). \n \n \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 6331  633119-2\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 15 Jun 2011 to 138.250.109.230.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \n3.1 Slab waveguide experiments \n \nFrom the angular shift of the peaks of incoupling (compared to the case when no bR adlayer is present), the refractive \nindex of the (unexcited) bR adlayer was determined to be to 1.52, in agreement with previous observations by other \nmethods.9 10 The rotational stage was then stopped at different angles in the region of effective coupling and the light \nintensity changes following flash excitation were measured.  \nFig. 3. shows two traces measured at opposite sides of the incoupling peak corresponding to the TE mode. The traces \nwere analyzed using global fitting with multiexponential curves. In the millisecond domain two exponentials resulted in \na good fit, with time onstants \u03c41=57 ms and \u03c42 = 350 ms, characteristic of the second half of the photocycle (M-decay) at \nlow humidity [11]. \n \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 6331  633119-3\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 15 Jun 2011 to 138.250.109.230.

Coupled light intensity changes measured upon flash excitation of the film. Ground state bR was excited by 570 nm \nflashes. The measuring light intensity was attenuated to 0.5 mW (He-Ne laser, \u03bb=633 nm), so as to avoid considerable \npre-excitation of the sample. Traces were recorded at two positions (a and b, with incoupling angles \u03b8a=5.967\u00b0 and \n\u03b8b=6.167\u00b0), on opposite sides of the incoupling peak at the transversal electric mode (\u03b8TE=6.067\u00b0). The amplitude of \nthe relative light intensity change at \u03b8a was about 70%. \n \nThe antisymmetry of the traces show that the primary origin of the intensity change is a transient change of the coupling \nangle, confirming the dominating role of refractive index changes in the observed switching effect. From the maximal \nvalue of the angular shift, the corresponding light-induced refractive index change of the adlayer was calculated (2x10-3) \nusing the waveguide equations [10]. Its value is close to previous findings [7,8].   \nTo be able to correlate the changes of the coupling geometry to the steps of the photocycle, we also performed \nabsorption kinetic experiments on the same sample under identical conditions (not shown). Evaluating the kinetics of the \nM intermediate (obtained by measuring absorption changes of the bR film at 405 nm upon light excitation), we obtained \nthe same time constants as mentioned above. The correlation is in agreement with the Kramers-Kronig origin of the \nobserved refractive index changes on this time scale, corresponding to the nearly 160 nm difference between the \nabsorption maxima of the bR ground and M states. The speed of light modulation based on this effect, therefore, should \nbe limited by the kinetics of the M formation to about 50 \u00b5s in the photocycle of wild type bR, when using flash \nexcitation [11]. Under continuous illumination, however, when the light density is much lower, the buildup of the M \npopulation (\u03c4M), and consequently the refractive index changes are limited by the light intensity and the decay rate of M, \ntypically to the millisecond time).  \nThese pioneering experiments revealed that a dry film containing native bacteriorhodopsin shows unique nonlinear \noptical properties (high refractive index change controllable by light of different colours) that are in many respects \nsuperior to those of the materials presently applied in integrated optics [12]. In the following, we demonstrate the first \nintegrated optical application based on a miniature Mach-Zehnder interferometer performing a real switching effect by \nbacteriorhodopsin (efficiency higher than 90%). \n \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 6331  633119-4\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 15 Jun 2011 to 138.250.109.230.

The interference of the light at the output can thereby be changed from constructive to \ndestructive or the reverse. Without exposure, the optical environment and the effective refractive index stays the same in \nboth arms. When illuminating only one of the covered arms, a variation in the index of refraction leads to a phase \nimbalance in the two arms, and interference at the output of the interferometer.  \nFigure 3 demonstrates the high efficiency of bR-based all-optical integrated optical switching. The exciting light \nintensity was adjusted to show the maximal effect (15 mW, 90% intensity modulation, respectively). After switching on \nthe exciting light the steady state is reached within a few seconds, while the decay reflects the relaxation of the refractive \nindex of the bR film after the excitation was switched off.  \n \nFig. 3. Demonstration of the all-optical switching effect by the photopolymeric M-Z interferometer cover with a bR film as \nan adlayer.

In the investigated range, two minima and two maxima were observed, however, no \nsaturation of the effect was found despite the high-intensity excitation. \n  \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 6331  633119-5\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 15 Jun 2011 to 138.250.109.230.

The effects are interpreted \naccording to a simplified model describing the bR photocycle at moderate humidities, where the N and O forms are \nmissing, and only the K, L and M intermediates are present (Figure 6). \n \nFig. 6. A simplified scheme of the photocycle of dried bacteriorhodopsin \n \nThe red light intensity increase at lower levels of excitation (Fig. 5) is due to the accumulation of the M form in steady-\nstate, where the longest-living intermediate is present with the highest weight. Under conditions where the concentration \nof M is maximal, the refractive index change of the film is 2x10-4 as observed previously by the OWLS technique [12]. \nThe subsequent absorption increase at 676 nm shows that another photoproduct is accumulated at higher light intensities, \nthat is spectrally red-shifted compared to the ground-state bR. Note that after switching off the excitation, the absorption \nalways returns to a minimum value corresponding to M-saturation before final relaxation. This finding strongly suggests \nthat the red-shifted intermediate returns to the ground state (BR) via M. Taking into account the well-known fact that \nlight excitation of both the L and M intermediates drives them back to the ground state [13], we suggest that the \nimplicated red-shifted intermediate must be K or of its type.  \nIn agreement with the experimental findings it is seen that while at low exciting light intensities M is accumulated, at \nhigher values K dominates. At the highest applied light intensity the refractive index change of the film was estimated to \nbe -9x10-4. This high value, which is comparable to that accompanying the BR-M transition but with negative sign, \nshould be interpreted by the anomalous refractive index of K having an absorption maximum close to the wavelength of \nthe measuring light.  \nThese results suggest that besides M, also the K intermediate has favorable non-linear optical properties (high refractive \nindex change) that, due to the picosecond kinetics, may be readily be utilized in integrated optics or other nonlinear \noptical applications. \n4. CONCLUSIONS \n \nThe above results demonstrate the feasibility of using a protein as a programmable active element in integrated optical \ndevices. Hence the fabrication of microstructured all-optical devices coated with bR adlayer is primarily a technological \ntask. The size, speed and cyclicity of the light-induced refractive index changes of bR are comparable to or exceed the \ncorresponding properties of inorganic NLO crystals, while the possibility of genetically controlling the optical properties \nof bR (absorption spectrum, cycle time, etc.) offers a great and unique versatility for optical circuit design. \n5.
