INTRODUCTION \n \n   The issue of multi-view video coding has grown in \nsignificance following recent advances in 3D capture and \ndisplay technologies, making applications like 3D TV [1] \nand Free viewpoint TV (FTV) [2] possible, where the user is \ngiven the chance to navigate between viewing angles freely. \nDue to increased visual content, it is essential to use \nadvanced techniques for compressing multi-view data, \nwhere temporal as well as inter-view correlations are \nexploited.  \n     A large amount of the research carried out so far on \nMVC is aimed at improving the compression performance \n[3-4]. Though it is important, there are other requirements of \nMVC, such as low-delay random view access, enabling fast  \n \n \n \nview switching in free-view video applications. In [5], a \nmulti-view light field coding technique is proposed, based \non Wyner-Ziv coding. It provides enhanced random access \ncapability, although the performance of the Wyner-Ziv \ncoding used is poor compared to H.264\/AVC [6]. Similarly, \nin [7], an MVC approach based on distributed source coding \nis proposed to tackle the free-view switching problem, where \nthe results are compared against conventional closed loop \nand intra coding. In [8], an MVC approach based on 3D \npoint clouds is proposed providing easy free-view access. \nHowever, it uses a different picture representation which is \nnot suitable for use with block based video coders. In [9], \nSP\/SI frame coding, interleaved coding and multiple \nrepresentations coding are tested separately. All of the \napproaches perform worse than the conventional MVC \napproach which uses hierarchical B prediction [4] in both \nview and time domain, although they provide reduced delay \nview random access capability.  \n     In this paper, a different inter-view prediction structure is \nproposed, which aims to replace bi-predictive (B) coded \nviews with downsampled (using bit-rate adaptive \ndownscaling ratios) and predictive (P) coded views. The \ndefinitions of B and P coding are as stated in the standard \n[6]. The goal is to omit B type inter-view predictions, which \ninherently introduces view hierarchy to the system and \nincreases random view access delay. The disadvantage is \nthat B coding, which improves the coding efficiency \nsignificantly, is avoided. However, the proposed scheme \npreserves the coding performance by using downsampled \nand P coded views, reducing the random view access delay \nremarkably at the same time. A mathematical model is \nconstructed to relate the coding performances of different \ncoding types used within the proposed scheme to each other, \nwhich enables us to estimate the relative coding efficiencies \nof different inter-view prediction structures.  \n     Section 2 describes the bit-rate adaptive downsampling \nscheme. The proposed inter-view prediction structures are \ngiven in section 3. The performance estimation model is \nderived in section 4, where derived performance graphs are \ncompared to real experimental results.  Section 5 provides \nthe subjective evaluation results and section 6 concludes the \npaper. \nThis work was developed within VISNET II, a European Network \nof Excellence (http:\/\/www.visnetnoe.org), funded under the \nEuropean Commission IST FP6 programme. \n745978-1-4244-2571-6\/08\/$25.00 \u00a92008 IEEE ICME 2008\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

BIT-RATE ADAPTIVE DOWNSAMPLING \n \n   The idea behind downsampling a view prior to coding and \nupsampling the reconstructed samples then after is based on \nthe trade-off between two types of distortion: distortion due \nto quantization and distortion due to downsampling. \nConsidering a fixed bit-rate budget, increasing the \ndownsampling ratio means that less coarse quantization \nneeds to be used. Thus, more information is lost through \ndownsampling, but less is lost through coarse quantization. \nFinding the optimum trade-off between the two distortion \nsources should lead to improved compression efficiency. To \nobserve this, views were downsampled with different \ndownscaling ratios prior to encoding, ranging from 0.3 to \n0.9 (same ratio for each dimension of the video, leaving the \naspect ratio unchanged). These ratios were tested over a \nbroad range of bit-rates. The results indicated that the \noptimum trade-off between the two distortion types varies \nwith the target bit rate. Fig. 1 shows the performance curves \nof downscaled coding with some downscaling ratios and full \nresolution coding for a particular view of Breakdancer test \nsequence [10].  \n     The best performance characteristics at medium and low \nbit-rates, where the quantization distortion is more effective, \nis achieved with 0.6 scaling ratio (mid-range), whereas at \nmuch higher bit-rates, where the effect of the distortion due \nto downsampling becomes more destructive, larger scaling \nratios (0.8-0.9) are suitable, introducing less downsampling \ndistortion. Very low ratios, such as 0.3, are only useful at \nvery low bit-rates, where the reconstruction quality is \nalready insufficient to be considered (less than 32 dB). \nResults do not change over different data-sets.  \n     In the rest, for simplicity, two predefined downscaling \nratios are used, 0.6 for bit-rates less than 300 kbps, 0.8 for \nbit-rates over 300 kbps targeting VGA sequences (640x480) \nat 25 fps. Accordingly, up to 20% save in bit-rate is \nachieved for individual views at certain reconstruction \nqualities.  \n \n3. INTER-VIEW PREDICTION STRUCTURE \n \n   The random view access corresponds to accessing any \nframe in a GOP (group of pictures) of any view with \nminimal decoding of other views [9]. In Fig. 2 (a), the \nreference inter-view prediction structure of the current MVC \ndraft is shown (for 8 views and 16 views cases) at anchor \nframe positions. The random view access cost, defined as \nthe maximum number of frames that must be decoded to \nreach the desired view, is 8 and 16 for the 8-view and the \n16-view cases respectively.  The disadvantage is that as the \nnumber of cameras increases, the cost increases with the \nsame rate. Furthermore, in some streaming applications only \nrelevant views may be sent to the user, to save bandwidth. \nWith such dependency structure, more views would have to \nbe streamed and hence, the bit-rate would increase. In Fig. 2 \n(b), the proposed low delay view random access model with \ndownsampled P coding (LDVRA+DP) is given. The Group \nof Views (GOV) concept is used which is suitable for free \nviewpoint video (separated by dashed lines) and in each \nGOV, one view, called a base view, is coded at full spatial \nresolution, while other views, called enhancement views, are \ndownsampled using the idea described in section 2 and are \npredictive (P) coded. None of the views are B coded, so that \nno extra layers of view dependency are present. Every \nenhancement view is dependant on its associated base view \nand every base view depends on the same base view, whose \nanchor frames are intra coded. This obviously necessitates \nperceptual testing of the downsampled views (later \nupsampled again) to observe the potential effect of low-pass \nfiltering, which will be discussed in section 5. \n              (a)             (b)  \nFigure 2.

PERFORMANCE ESTIMATION MODEL AND \nEXPERIMENTAL RESULTS \n \n   In this work it is assumed that the coding performances at \nanchor frame positions of both techniques reflect the overall \nmulti-view coding performances of the respective \ntechniques. The reason is that most of the coding gain in \nMVC, compared to simulcast, is achieved at anchor frame \npositions where there are no means of temporal prediction. \nTherefore, only the coding efficiency at anchor frame \npositions is going to be evaluated. In both techniques there is \none intra coded (I) view (all GOPs begin with an intra coded \nframe). Besides, both prediction structures contain a certain \nnumber of P views, B views and\/or DP views. Another \nassumption is that for each view, I coding at anchor frame \npositions at the same time instant would generate similar bit-\nrate for the same output quality. Same is valid for P coding. \nThe efficiency metrics of P, B and DP coding are defined as \n\u012eP, \u012eB, \u012eDP respectively. \u012eP is set to 1. Accordingly, \u012eB and \n\u012eDP change between 0 and 1. The values of \u012eB, \u012eDP are \ndetermined experimentally, and their values for different \nviews are found to be consistent. \u012eB and \u012eDP are determined \nat different bit-rates by taking the ratios of output bit-rates \nfor B and DP coded views respectively to the output bit-rate \nof P coded views. A lower efficiency index means higher \ncoding efficiency. It is important to select the bit-rates of B \ncoded and DP coded views such that they generate \nreconstructed images at similar objective quality, to ensure \nthat the efficiency comparison between them is fair. Let the \ntotal number of cameras in a multi-view system be equal to \n2n. The per-view coding efficiency index can be calculated \nas: \nReference MVC  \u00c6\nn\nnn B\n2\n)1( \u03b1\u2212+\n \nLDVRA+DP (GOV=3) \u00c6 \u00ac \u00bc \u00ac \u00bc( )\nn\nnn\nDP\n2\n13\n413\n2 \u03b1++\u2212\n \nLDVRA+DP (GOV=5)  \u00c6 \u00ac \u00bc \u00ac \u00bc( )\nn\nnn\nDP\n2\n15\n815\n2 \u03b1++\u2212\n (1) \n   Fig. 3 (a) and (b) show per-view efficiency versus PSNR \ngraphs drawn for 16-view Rena and 8-view Breakdancer \nsequences, for experimentally determined values of \u012eB and \n\u012eDP. At several frame reconstruction quality levels, the \noutput bit-rates of B and DP coded views are divided by the \noutput bit-rate of P coded view to get \u012eB and \u012eDP. These \ngraphs represent rough estimations of real performance \ngraphs although the horizontal axis doesn\u2019t directly stand for \nthe bit-rate. However, since the per-view efficiency indices \nfor each method are calculated with \u012e values obtained at \nsimilar output qualities, they are proportional to the actual \nbit-rate. Actual coding results with JMVM [11] are given in \nFig. 4 (a) and (b). Common coding configurations for each \nview are shown on Table 1. LDRA curves represent the \ntechnique, in which no downsampling is utilized for P coded \nviews. LDRA performs worse than the reference MVC \nmethod, since it does not benefit from the coding gains of B \ncoding or DP coding. The proposed LDVRA+DP coding \ntends to perform slightly better than the reference coding \ntechnique at especially lower bit-rates. The real relative \nefficiencies of the proposed techniques with respect to the \nreference coding technique are reflected in the estimated \ngraphs. In order to compare the relative efficiencies of both \ntechniques 1\u03a6  is defined as the difference between the per-\nview efficiency indices of the reference and the proposed \ntechniques.

It is verified in both the \nestimated and the real coding results. \n \n5. SUBJECTIVE EVALUATION \n \n   The perceptual quality of the proposed low delay random \naccess scheme with DP coding is compared with the \nreference technique containing B coded views, using the \nstimulus comparison - adjectival categorical judgement \nmethod described in recommendation [12]. Rena (Nagoya \nUniversity), Breakdancer and Ballet (Microsoft Research) \ntest sequences are used for evaluations. A differential mean \nscore opinion is calculated at two different bit-rates and \nplotted on a differential scale, where 0 corresponds to no \nperceptual difference between the two methods and negative \nvalues indicate that the proposed method performs better. 16 \nsubjects are used in the evaluations. Fig. 5 shows the results.     \nSince the Rena sequence is a blurry sequence originally, the \ndownsampling distortion is not visually sensible. Therefore, \nthere is no visual change for Rena sequence. On the other \nhand, for the other sequences tested, it can be observed that \nat high bit-rates, the perceptual qualities of both methods do \nnot differ, indicating that the downsampling distortion \n(blurriness) is not a significant issue. At lower bit-rates, \nquantization distortion (blockiness) is more visible than the \ndownsampling distortion and hence the proposed method \ngenerates visually more satisfactory results.  \n \n6. CONCLUSION \n \n   It is observed that the random view access performance of \nmulti-view coding systems can be improved significantly  \n \nTable 1. Coding configuration. \nBasis QP 22, 32, 37 \nEntropy Coding CABAC \nMotion search range  32 \nTemporal prediction structure Hierarchical B prediction  \nTemporal GOP size 12 \nRD optimization Yes \n \nwith respect to the conventional MVC method, without any \nloss of coding performance and perceptual quality. The \nreason is that the performance of efficient B coding, present \nin the conventional MVC method, can be achieved by the \ndownsampled P (DP) coding. The proposed inter-view \ndependency structure is more suitable for fast switching free- \nview systems, due to the utilization of the concept of group \nof views (GOV). Furthermore, assigning larger GOV sizes \ncan further increase the compression performance, without \naffecting the overall random view access delay. The \nproposed approach brings slight increase in the complexity \ndue to the addition of up-conversion and down-conversion \nblocks, but this is balanced with the reduction in the \nprocessing load for the downsampled videos.  \n     One limitation of this technique is with highly textured \nvideo sequences, where the inherent low-pass filtering effect \nmight significantly degrade the subjective quality. This can \nbe overcome by transmitting extra residuals for the blocks in \nthe vicinity of object edges, to improve the visual quality, \nwhich is of future research interest.  \n \n7.
