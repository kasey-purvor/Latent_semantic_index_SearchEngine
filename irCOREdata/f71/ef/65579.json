Mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet over the past decade has caused the impression that\nthe ice sheet has been behaving anomalously to the warming of the 1990s. We have reconstructed the\nrecent (1866\u20132005) surface mass-balance (SMB) history of the Greenland ice sheet on a 5\u00025 km grid\nusing a runoff-retention model based on the positive degree-day method. The model is forced with new\ndatasets of temperature and precipitation patterns dating back to 1866. We use an innovative method to\naccount for the influence of year-on-year surface elevation changes on SMB estimates and have found\nthis effect to be minor. All SMB estimates are made relative to the 1961\u201390 average SMB and we\ncompare annual SMB estimates from the period 1995\u20132005 to a similar period in the past (1923\u201333)\nwhere SMB was comparable, and conclude that the present-day changes are not exceptional within the\nlast 140 years. Peripheral thinning has dominated the SMB response during the past decade, as in\n1923\u201333, but we also show that thinning was not restricted to the margins during this earlier period.\nINTRODUCTION\nOwing to their potential impact on ocean\u2013atmosphere\ncirculation and global sea-level change, the stability of the\nEarth\u2019s large ice sheets is central to the topic of global\nchange in response to a projected climate warming. The\nrecent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)\nreport (Lemke and others, 2007) summarizes various efforts\nin estimating the mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet.\nThese estimates are in disagreement but they do highlight an\nincreasing rate of mass loss from Greenland during the past\n5\u201310 years.\nRecent geodetic observations have shed light on the\npatterns and magnitude of surface elevation change.\nCombining the results of laser altimeter surveys and\nsnowfall\/melt modelling, Krabill and others (2004) demon-\nstrated that average ice loss between 1993 and 1998 was\n60 km3 a\u20131 ice equivalent (55Gt a\u20131) and between 1997 and\n2003 was 80\u000312 km3 a\u20131 ice equivalent (73Gt a\u20131) (all\nvolume changes are henceforward quoted in ice equi-\nvalent). According to a separate study (Zwally and others,\n2005), the Greenland ice sheet produced a small overall\ngain of 12\u00033.3Gt a\u20131 during 1992\u20132002. Variation in\nestimates of mass loss from altimeter studies is the likely\nresult of the particular treatment adopted to account for\nsnow compaction and densification. With the onset of the\nGravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) in\n2002, the bigger picture of mass loss from Greenland has\nbeen revealed. After corrections for land hydrology and\nglacial isostatic adjustment-related (GIA-related) mass\nchanges, Greenland is showing an overall decline in mass\nbalance from 2002 to 2006. The most recent estimates from\nthe GRACE satellite over 2003\u201305 indicate a mass loss of\n101\u0003 16Gt a\u20131 (110 km3 a\u20131) with accumulation at eleva-\ntions higher than 2000 m and loss below 2000 m\n(Luthcke and others, 2006). An overlapping period of data\n(2002\u201306) was analysed in a later study where a loss of\n248\u0003 36 km3 a\u20131 was detected (Velicogna and Wahr, 2006).\nAlthough there is disagreement in the absolute values of\nmass loss, it is clear that: (i) the ice sheet is in a negative\nbalance; and (ii) the rate of mass loss has been increasing\nover the last decade.\nThe primary mechanisms of mass loss are the discharge\nof ice into the ocean via outlet glaciers (see Fig. 1) and\nrunoff of surface melt. Annual variations in outlet glacier\ndischarge have been recorded in glaciers in southeast\nGreenland (Rignot and others, 2004; Howat and others,\n2005, 2007), indicating that these systems may be capable\nof responding to annual climatic changes. Greenland\u2019s\nlargest outlet glacier, Jakobshavn Isbr\u00e6, has been studied\nsince 1992, with velocity variations apparently coinciding\nwith periods of thickening and thinning (Joughin and\nothers, 2004). The Jakobshavn terminus retreated over the\npast 30 years (Sohn and others, 1998), with calving rate\nmirroring variations in glacier speed (Joughin and others,\n2004). Rignot and Kanagaratnam (2006) estimate a dis-\ncharge of 23.6 km3 a\u20131 from Jakobshavn during 1996\u20132000.\nConversely, the doubling of glacier velocity recorded over\nthe period 1985\u20132003 by Joughin and others (2004) is\ninterpreted to produce an increase in glacier discharge from\n26.5 km3 a\u20131 (1985) to 50 km3 a\u20131 (2003). Other major\ncontributions to mass loss during 1996\u20132000 arise from\nglaciers in the east (Rignot and Kanagaratnam, 2006):\nKangerdlugssuaq (27.8 km3 a\u20131) and Helheim (26.3 km3 a\u20131),\nas well as a total discharge of 67 km3 a\u20131 from a collection\nof smaller glaciers in southeast Greenland. A recent study\nby Howat and others (2007) on some east coast outlet\nglaciers has shown a doubling in mass loss in under a year\n(2004), but their combined rate of mass loss had decreased\nin 2006. The response of Greenland\u2019s surface mass balance\nAnnals of Glaciology 50 2009178\nto climatic changes over the last 150 years is not as well\nstudied and is investigated in this study. Previously\npublished model estimates based on the positive degree-\nday method (Janssens and Huybrechts, 2000) show a\ndecrease in surface mass balance between 1993 and\n1998 (\u201315\u0003 60 km3 a\u20131) and between 1998 and 2003 (\u2013\n40\u000365 km3 a\u20131) (Hanna and others, 2005), but error bars\non the estimates indicate that the overall sign of the mass\nbalance may be either positive or negative. Box and others\n(2006b) suggest an ice mass loss of about 100 km3 a\u20131 for\nthe period 1988\u20132004, after a correction for glacier\ndischarge and subglacial melting.\nIn this paper, we present a time series of the annual\nsurface mass balance (SMB) of the Greenland ice sheet for\nthe period 1866\u20132005. Values of SMB are quoted with\nrespect to the average value for the 1961\u201390 climatological\nnormal period. In addition, we report on how the spatial\npatterns of SMB vary over specified historic time intervals.\nThis will place into context the current behaviour of the ice\nsheet, and specifically how SMB has varied both spatially\nand temporally during the late 19th century and early 21st\ncentury. Patterns of SMB are important indicators of the\nstability of an ice sheet under the present meteorological\nconditions. For example, peripheral thinning of an ice sheet\nand migration of the equilibrium line towards higher\nelevations denote that the ice sheet may be in a positive\nfeedback cycle of decay. These observations provide more\ninsight than measurements of outlet glacier discharge made\nover only a few years, which are shown to have interannual\nfluctuation (Howat and others, 2007). A brief discussion of\nthe mass-balance model is given, in which we briefly assess\nthe impact of excluding elevation changes in SMB\ncalculations. We then discuss the results and focus, in\nparticular, on two applications: (i) comparison of the\nresponse of the ice sheet to a recent period of warming\nand a similar warm period during the 1920s (Chylek and\nothers, 2006) to examine how exceptional the recent\nchanges are within a longer time context; and (ii) com-\nparison of the model to observations of surface elevation\nchanges from 1995 to 2005 to gauge qualitatively the\nrelative contribution of SMB changes in the observed total\nsurface changes.\nDATA AND TECHNIQUES\nMass balance was calculated by applying a runoff-retention\nmodel (Janssens and Huybrechts, 2000) based on the\npositive degree-day (PDD) method (Braithwaite and Olesen,\n1989; Reeh, 1991). The model is forced using monthly\ntemperature and annual precipitation minus evaporation\n(P \u0004 E) datasets from two sources. From 1866 to 1957, we\ninput climatic data assembled from a spatio-temporal\ncorrelation between coastal meteorological and ice-core\ndata and Polar MM5 output (Box and others, 2006a, 2008),\nhereafter named \u2018BOX\u2019. From 1958 to 2005, we use data\nassembled from European Centre for Medium-Range Weath-\ner Forecasts F-ERA40 reanalyses (Hanna and others, 2008),\nnamed \u2018ECMWF\u2019. These data, shown in Figure 2, are\nprojected onto a 5\u00025 km grid, on which the SMB is\ncalculated at monthly intervals and integrated over the entire\nice sheet to give an overall annual mass-balance figure.\nThis study extends the work of Hanna and others (2005,\n2008) in two important respects. The period considered is\nlonger (1866\u20132005 compared with 1958\u20132003) and we\napply climate forcing in \u2018anomaly mode\u2019 to reduce\nsensitivity to biases in the input time series of precipitation\nFig. 1. Map of locations and features mentioned in the text: towns\n(red), regions (black) and outlet glaciers (blue).\nFig. 2.

(b) Annual precipitation ratio averaged over\nice-sheet area. Colour convention as in (a).\nWake and others: Surface mass-balance changes of the Greenland ice sheet 179\nand temperature. The temperature and precipitation are\nreduced to anomalies with respect to a baseline average\nestablished using the climate datasets. The parameterized\ntemperature and precipitation fields are perturbed by their\nrespective anomalies (see later in this section). A critical step\nrequired to run the model in anomaly mode is the selection\nof a baseline period during which the climatic variation is\nrepresentative of a longer-term average. The length of the\nbaseline period must be sufficiently long such that the\noccurrence of rare and extreme climate events does not\nsignificantly influence estimates of longer-term averages. We\nchoose 1961\u201390 as our baseline period. Hanna and others\n(2005) found this period to be very close to a balanced total\nmass budget averaged over the entire ice sheet. For our\nanalysis we make the working assumption that such a\nbalance is also valid down to the level of individual drainage\nbasins, although it is not possible to support this assertion\nwith strong evidence. Also, our reference precipitation\ndataset is homogenized to the 1961\u201390 climate and is\ntherefore representative of this period (Huybrechts and\nothers, 2004).\nFor each point (x, longitude; y, latitude) on the ice sheet,\nwe reduce the original datasets to their monthly (tm) or\nannual (ta) anomalies by the following methods:\nTanom\u00f0x, y, tm\u00de \u00bc T \u00f0x, y, tm\u00de \u0004 \u0002T \u00f0x, y, 1961\u000490m\u00de \u00f01\u00de\nPanom\u00f0x, y, ta\u00de \u00bc P\u00f0x, y, ta\u00de=\u0002P\u00f0x, y, 1961\u000490a\u00de: \u00f02\u00de\nIt was necessary to splice the two datasets because the\nECMWF datasets only extend back to 1958, and their use is\nfavoured after 1958 because the data are reasonably well\nvalidated (Hanna and Valdes, 2001; Hanna and others,\n2001). We use the BOX dataset to extend back to 1866.\nAlso, by applying the model in anomaly mode, any trend or\nbias introduced by splicing the two different climate time\nseries is removed. Figure 2a shows the overlap achieved by\nsplicing the two temperature datasets. From 1958 onwards,\nboth datasets mirror each other well and we can therefore be\nconfident that switching to the second dataset will not distort\nour results pre-1958. Over the climatological normal period\n1961\u201390, neither dataset shows a convincing increase\/\ndecrease of mean annual temperature (TMA), but both show\ncomparable trends (BOX: \u20130.02\u00030.698C a\u20131; ECMWF:\n\u20130.02\u00030.778Ca\u20131). The striking feature of the temperature\nseries is the longer period (50 years) variation imprinted on\nthe annual variation. Significant increases in temperature\nanomaly are recorded about 1920 and 1995. We observe\nthat the appearances of the precipitation anomaly series\nprovided by the two datasets are very different (Fig. 2b). The\nBOX dataset shows lower variation and no discernible trend\nover our selected baseline period (\u20130.0001\u0003 0.0008 a\u20131).\nWe calculate an increase of 0.005\u00030.0025 a\u20131 in the\nECMWF data, which is different in sign and 50 times that\nrecorded in the BOX dataset. The reason for the difference\nbetween the datasets is not known, but since no significant\ntrend in our baseline period is recorded in either dataset,\nthere is little consequence in the fact that the variability is\nnot consistent.\nThe monthly temperature at each point on the grid is a\nsum of the parameterized temperature (Huybrechts and de\nWolde, 1999) plus the anomaly (Tanom). The parameterized\ntemperature depends on elevation and latitude and follows a\ncosine function over the year. Mean annual temperature\n(TMA, in 8C) is described by a linear function and is\ndependent on latitude and elevation (in metres) as adapted\nfrom Reeh (1991):\nTMA\u00f0x, y\u00de \u00bc 49:19\u0004 \u00bd0:007992\u0002 elevation\u0004 \u00f00:7576y\u00de\n\u00f03\u00de\nThe near-surface temperature inversion is accounted for at\nhigher latitudes by the following equation:\nThreshold \u00bc 20\u00f0y \u0004 65\u00de: \u00f04\u00de\nIf the elevation is below the threshold value for a particular\nlocation, then the elevation term in the parameterization for\nTMA is substituted with the threshold value calculated\nabove. Mean July temperature (TMJ) also follows a linear\nfunction, for tm \u00bc 7, i.e. the seventh month:\nTMJ\u00f0x, y, 7\u00de \u00bc 30:78\u0004 \u00f00:006277\u0002 elevation\u00de\n\u0004 \u00f00:3262y\u00de: \u00f05\u00de\nMonthly temperatures (T) are calculated (for tm \u00bc 1, 12\u00de:\nT \u00f0x, y, tm\u00de \u00bc TMA\u0004 j\u00f0TMA\u0004 TMJ\u00dej\n\u0005 cos\u00bd\u00f0\u0002=6\u00de\u00f0tm \u0004 1\u00de\u0006 \u00fe Tanom\u00f0x, y, tm\u00de: \u00f06\u00de\nThe positive degree-days (PDDs, units: 8C-day) are calcu-\nlated using the scheme applied in Janssens and Huybrechts\n(2000) and take into account monthly deviations of the\ntemperature from the monthly average. We treat the\nprecipitation series differently. A precipitation field known\nto be representative of the 1961\u201390 average (Huybrechts\nand others, 2004) is perturbed on an annual basis by the\nfractional difference in precipitation for the year compared\nwith the 1961\u201390 annual average (Panom). This produces a\npredicted annual precipitation for each point on the surface.\nWhether this precipitation falls as rain or snow depends on\nthe amount of time the surface temperature remains above\nor below a predefined temperature threshold of 18C,\nrespectively. Rain is immediately added to the liquid-water\n(melt) term. Snow is melted first at a rate of 2.7mmw.e.\n8C\u20131 d\u20131, also liberating any capillary water that may be\ntrapped. This melt then has the possibility to be retained and\nis proportional to the original snow cover and surface\ntemperature. It will then be retained as superimposed ice.\nAny unfrozen water remaining is added to capillary water\nuntil saturation of the snow cover. After saturation, residual\nwater is runoff (Pfeffer and others, 1991). Once all snow has\ndisappeared, any remaining PDDs are used to melt super-\nimposed ice, if any, and then glacier ice, which melts at a\nhigher rate of 7.2mmw.e. 8C\u20131 d\u20131. The water gained from\nthis stage is added to the runoff. We apply the retention\nmodel \u2018pr_capil\u2019 described in Janssens and Huybrechts\n(2000). This takes into account refreezing and capillary\nwater retention within the snowpack. We refer the reader to\nJanssens and Huybrechts (2000) for further insight. SMB is\ndefined as rain and snow minus runoff. We note that\ndegree-day factors are highly variable around Greenland,\nand that calculated runoff is highly sensitive to these values.\nThe values quoted here are fixed spatially and temporally\nand are almost the same as those used in Braithwaite and\nOlesen (1989), and are within the range of values reported\nby Braithwaite (1995).We use an innovative technique to\ninvestigate the influence of annual surface elevation\nchanges on SMB prediction, and to correct the adopted\nelevation dataset (valid for 1994; Bamber and others,\n2001). This will facilitate the realistic representation of\nelevation-related temperature, and therefore SMB. We\ntreat the change of ice-sheet elevation due to changes in\nWake and others: Surface mass-balance changes of the Greenland ice sheet180\nSMB (in ice equivalent and ignoring changes in density\nprofiles) as follows:\n@H\u00f0x, y, t\u00de \u00bc SMB\u00f0x, y, t\u00de \u0004 SMB\u00f0x, y, 1961\u000490\u00de \u00f07\u00de\nwhere @H is the local surface elevation change arising from\nan SMB change in 1 year for a point on the ice sheet and\nSMB is the local SMB defined on an annual basis either at\ntime \u2018t\u2019 or as the average for the period 1961\u201390. For\nequilibrium at a point on the ice sheet (assumed for the\nperiod 1961\u201390), @H \u00bc 0. Any deviation from zero will\nresult in a change of elevation.\nThere are a number of assumptions implicit in the method\ndescribed above. For example: (i) the parameterized\nmonthly temperatures are valid for the 1961\u201390 period\n(i.e. in the first approximation, the 1994 elevation produces\ntemperatures representative of the 1961\u201390 monthly\nmeans); (ii) the ice-sheet surface is in equilibrium with the\n1961\u201390 average climate; and (iii) from (ii) we implicitly\nassume that the 1961\u201390 ice flow is constant over the whole\nintegration period considered here. To correct for the effect\nof surface elevation changes on surface temperature, and\nhence SMB, we sum the elevation changes from the start of\nthe model run (1866) until 1994 and correct the original\nelevation by this amount, and re-run the model until\nsatisfactory convergence of ice-sheet averaged SMB with\nthe original SMB calculated from the 1994 elevation dataset.\nBy doing this, we can be confident that we are using a fairly\nrealistic representation of the 1866 surface elevation. The\nmodel arrives at a similar prediction for 1994 SMB after two\niterations. We assume @H\u00f0x, y, t\u00de equates directly to a\nchange in surface elevation and correct the original surface\nelevation grid at each point in the same way.\nSurface mass-balance results are biased if we use\nuncorrected elevation grids to predict parameterized tem-\nperature. From 1866 to 1994 we model a small rate of mass\nloss of 0.77 km3 a\u20131. The consequence for the surface\nelevation is that when using the uncorrected dataset the\nsurface elevation for the start of the time series (1866) is\nlower than it should be and we will predict a less positive\nSMB. If these effects are ignored, our analysis found that the\npredicted SMB is altered by on average 2 km3 a\u20131. If, during\nthe period 1866\u20131994, the average SMB was highly positive\nor negative, correcting the reference elevation dataset would\nbe essential.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nFigure 3 shows the calculated changes in SMB with respect\nto the 1961\u201390 average. Analysis of the SMB time series\nshows that the ice sheet was slightly losing surface mass\noverall during the period 1961\u201390. Even though the input\nclimate data suggest that there is no trend in the climate\nanomalies over this period, the ice sheet is still responding to\nyear-on-year non-zero perturbations in temperature and\nprecipitation. The anomalies in temperature and precipi-\ntation do not balance each other to give an exactly zero SMB\nanomaly. The model indicates that the ice sheet is in an\noverall state of mass loss, and this neither accelerates nor\ndecelerates significantly over the baseline period\n(+0.62\u00032 km3 a\u20131). We were unable to replicate such a\nclose state of dynamic equilibrium with the use of other\nclimatological normal baselines (e.g. 1971\u20132000).\nThere are a number of features evident in Figure 3. For the\nfirst 60 years of the study period, the ice sheet was mainly in\na state of positive SMB with respect to 1961\u201390. This reflects\nthe fact that temperatures in this period are lower than the\n1961\u201390 average in Greenland and worldwide. There is a\ndistinct change to a period of prolonged negative SMB\nanomalies at about 1925 that persisted until about 1960.\nThis change is clearly related to the relatively high\ntemperatures experienced during this period, particularly\nbetween the mid-1920s and 1950. Between 1970 and the\nend of the 20th century the SMB predictions display high\nvariability but give, on average, a slightly negative SMB\nanomaly. The final 6 years of the study period indicate a\ndistinct and consistent negative mass-balance anomaly\nwhich correlates well with the elevated temperatures shown\nin Figure 2. Over the entire period (1866\u20132005), the overall\nSMB of the ice sheet is almost constant, with surface volume\nbeing lost at a rate of 0.89\u00030.15 km3 a\u20131 based on a\nstraightforward linear regression of the SMB time series.\nFigure 4 shows the spatial pattern of the cumulated SMB for\nFig. 3. Time series of annual surface mass-balance anomalies for the period 1866\u20132005. Values are quoted in km3 ice equivalent.\nWake and others: Surface mass-balance changes of the Greenland ice sheet 181\nthe entire study period and indicates that most of the ice has\nbeen lost at the margin, with some areas having lost over\n150m of ice since 1866. A feature persistent in time is the\nsharp transition between positive and negative cumulated\nSMB anomaly along the ice margin in the south and east.\nAlthough southeast Greenland receives high amounts of\naccumulation, the topography of East Greenland is steep, so\nthe ablation zone is narrow compared with the west of\nGreenland. In the central portion of the ice sheet, a\nnortheast\/southwest divide of net lowering and net growth\n(respectively) is visible. Overall, the maximum amount of\nsurface ice lost in this area is 5m, with a maximum of\n5\u201310m gained over some areas in the southwest.\nThe time series presented in Figure 3 provides a unique\nrecord of the mass-balance response of the Greenland ice\nsheet to temperature and precipitation variations during the\npast 140 years. Since much current attention is focused on\nthe response of the Greenland ice sheet to the temperature\nincrease over the past decade, an interesting application of\nour results is to place the more recent changes within a\nlonger time context. A noticeable feature of the time series\n(Fig. 3) is the transition from lengthy periods of positive\n(1866\u20131922) to negative (1923\u201353) SMB anomalies. This\nfirst sequence of positive SMB anomalies corresponds to the\nGreenland ice sheet emerging from the Little Ice Age. The\nLittle Ice Age is a prolonged period of cooling beginning\nafter the \u2018Medieval Warm Epoch\u2019 (approximately AD 1200)\nand lasting until the early 20th century. During this period\n(1866\u20131922) we model an average annual SMB anomaly of\n37\u000311 km3 a\u20131. Csatho and others (2008) detected a period\nof thinning of Jakobshavn Isbr\u00e6 during 1902\u201313, and linked\nthis behaviour to the interaction of the ice dynamics with\nchanges upstream of Jakobshavn Isbr\u00e6. We model an\naverage annual ice loss of approximately 5ma\u20131 between\n658N and 708N on the western margins of the ice sheet,\neven though the majority of the ice sheet is in a state of\npositive mass balance. Interestingly, our results also show an\narea of thinning (average ice loss 0.02\u20130.10ma\u20131) during\n1902\u201313 in the drainage area east of Jakobshavn Isbr\u00e6\nbetween 68.58N and 69.08N and extending up to 500 km\ninland in an east-southeast direction (not shown here). After\nthis, the Greenland ice sheet displays 40 years of high-\namplitude variation. We have identified two periods when\nthe average annual SMB was similar to the 1961\u201390 average\n(1995\u20132005: \u201369 km3 a\u20131; 1923\u201333: \u201367 km3 a\u20131). During\n1995\u20132005, the rate of increase of TMA was almost twice\nthat of the earlier period, and there are no discernible trends\nin the precipitation anomalies of either period (1995\u20132005:\n\u20130.007\u00030.008 a\u20131; 1923\u201333: 0.003\u0003 0.004 a\u20131). The rate of\nchange of mean summer temperature (June, July and August)\naveraged over the ice-sheet area for the two periods is\n0.178Ca\u20131 (1995\u20132005) and 0.048Ca\u20131 (1923\u201333), respect-\nively. In effect, we are seeing the same overall SMB response\nduring 1923\u201333, but under a smaller increase in rate of\nchange of mean annual and summer temperature than that\nexperienced during 1995\u20132005.\nThe spatial patterns of the SMB changes during these two\nperiods are not similar (Fig. 5). Both show high rates of\nperipheral lowering, but a larger area of the ice sheet\ndisplayed negative SMB anomalies during 1923\u201333. Much\nof this thinning during 1923\u201333 appears to have occurred in\nthe accumulation area, with this lowering being driven by\nlower than average accumulation rates rather than higher\nthan average ablation rates. The extensive growth for 1995\u2013\n2005 was not sufficient to counteract the high (5\u201310ma\u20131)\nrates of peripheral lowering. The growth\u2013thinning transition\nin the southeast is absent from the earlier period, but is a\nsignificant feature during 1995\u20132005. During the period\n1923\u201333, the average TMA anomaly over the ice sheet\nincreased by 0.758C compared with 1.98C for 1995\u20132005.\nThe Greenland ice sheet overall has therefore responded in a\nsimilar fashion to a smaller temperature increase in the early\n20th century, indicating that the current changes are not\nentirely exceptional. Neither time period exhibits a pattern\nof loss that is comparable to the long-term net SMB change\n(Fig. 4). Based on the simulations of these two periods, it\ncould as well be stated that the recent changes that have\nbeen monitored extensively (Krabill and others, 2004;\nLuthcke and others, 2006; Thomas and others, 2006) are\nrepresentative of natural sub-decadal fluctuations in the\nmass balance of the ice sheet and are not necessarily the\nresult of anthropogenic-related warming.\nOur predictions of ice loss due to SMB compare\nfavourably to published studies of surface elevation changes.\nFor 1997\u20132003, we model an average ice loss of \u201382 km3 a\u20131,\ncomparable to values obtained by Krabill and others (2004).\nLaser altimeter studies by Thomas and others (2006) record a\ndoubling in mass loss over two periods 1993\u201398 and 1998\u2013\n2004 (4\u201350Gt a\u20131 and 57\u2013105Gt a\u20131). We predict a similar\npattern for the two periods (\u201359Gt a\u20131 and \u201397Gt a\u20131,\nrespectively). By matching our results with Krabill and others\n(2004) and Thomas and others (2006), it may be interpreted\nthat many of the observed trends are caused mainly by\nchanges in SMB. However, we are not able to make firm\nconclusions on the respective role of ice dynamics vs SMB\nchanges on elevation changes because our assumption of\nequilibrium for 1961\u201390 may not hold for individual points\nFig. 4. Spatial pattern of total cumulated surface mass-balance\nchange for the period 1866\u20132005. Values are in metres ice\nequivalent.\nWake and others: Surface mass-balance changes of the Greenland ice sheet182\non our grid, even if such a balance has stronger support for\nthe Greenland ice sheet as a whole.\nComparison of recent laser altimetry (2000) and older\ndigital elevation models (1985) made by Podlech and\nothers (2004) shows that during 1985\u20132005 the area\naround Sermilik Glacier in South Greenland (Fig. 1) lost\n90m of ice at approximately the 500m elevation contour.\nIn this area, we model losses in the range 100\u2013200m.\nThese are larger than the values obtained from obser-\nvations, but lie in the range (\u201390 to \u2013130m) calculated by\nPodlech and others (2004). For the higher-elevation bands\n(500\u2013750m and 750\u20131000m) our predictions differ with\nthe measurements; we still model a significant annual\naverage thinning of 8\u201312ma\u20131. Again, this is likely to be a\nconsequence of our assumption of ice-sheet-wide equi-\nlibrium for 1961\u201390.\nOver the measurement period 1997\u20132003, our model-\nling of SMB reflects some features of Krabill and others\n(2004) such as (our data not pictured): lowering in the\narea of Kong Frederik VIII Land in the north (77\u2013808N,\n20\u2013308W) and near balance in the central area north of\n738N. However, there are also some important differences:\nthe work of Krabill and others (2004) reveals a wider area\nof negative elevation change in the eastern half of Green-\nland, whereas we model only localized (up to 20 km) wide\nareas of extreme (>5\u201310ma\u20131) surface lowering. Over the\nsame period, we model considerable (0.3\u20131.0ma\u20131) thin-\nning on the south dome of the Greenland ice sheet, where\nKrabill and others (2004) measure thickening of about\n0.1ma\u20131. Omission of finer-scale details that are present in\nour study is the likely result of interpolation between flight-\nlines. Our patterns of change bear more similarity to those\nof Thomas and others (2006) for the period 1993\u201398. We\nsee a similar pattern of near balance to slight (0.1ma\u20131)\nthickening through much of the central portions of the ice\nsheet. Although the resolution of Thomas and others\u2019 study\nis ten times less than ours, it picks out important small-scale\nfeatures present in our study: thinning of >0.6m a\u20131\nbetween 658N and 708N east of Jakobshavn, and extreme\nthinning in Kong Frederik VIII Land (see Fig. 1) and in a\nnarrow (<20 km) band between Savissivik (76.0238N,\n65.0818W) and Upernavik (72.788N, 56.178W) in the\nnorthwest.\nCONCLUSION\nWe have presented a modelling study tracking SMB changes\nof the Greenland ice sheet since 1866, reflecting how the ice\nsheet has behaved under the climatic conditions of the 19th\u2013\n21st centuries. Over the time window of our study, we find\nthat the Greenland ice sheet has reacted to, and endured, a\ntemperature increase similar to that experienced at present.\nHigher surface runoff rates similar to those of the last decade\nwere also present in an earlier warm period in the 1920s and\n1930s and apparently did not lead to a strong feedback cycle\nthrough surface lowering and increased ice discharge.\nJudging by the volume loss in these periods, we can interpret\nthat the current climate of Greenland is not causing any\nexceptional changes in the ice sheet. Mass loss through\nglacier discharge is currently believed to dominate mass loss\nthrough SMB, and both processes are likely to be correlated.\nForman and others (2007) report that the ice sheet retreated\n1\u20132 km inland at Kangerlussuaq, West Greenland, over the\npast 100 years. Although our model resolution is 5\u0002 5 km,\nwe predict complete disappearance of some ice-sheet points\nin this area, in line with these observations. We are not able\nto shed light on the relative contributions of ice dynamics vs\nSMB to the current mass loss, but our study puts the modern-\nday changes into the context of longer-term century time-\nscale changes.\nFig. 5.
