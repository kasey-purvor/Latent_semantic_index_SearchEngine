Introduction\nClassical epidemiological models postulate that a population is divided into a few classes of epidemio-\nlogical significance and homogeneously mixed. The spread of an infection is traditionally postulated to\noccur according to the principle of mass action and associated with it an incidence rate bilinear with re-\nspect to the numbers of susceptible and infective individuals (Anderson & May, 1991; Hethcote, 2000).\nMore specifically, if we denote by S(t) and I (t) the numbers of susceptible and infective individ uals, re-\nspectively, and if \u03b2 is the per capita contact rate, then there are \u03b2 I infective contacts. A fraction S\/N of\nthese contacts is with susceptible individuals, and hence the total number of new infections is \u03b2 I S\/N .\nHowever, there is a variety of reasons why this standard bilinear incidence rate may require modifi-\ncation, e.g. the underlying assumption of homogeneous mixing may be invalid. In this case the necessary\npopulation structure and heterogeneous mixing may be incorporated into a model with a specific form\nof non-linear transmission. A non-linear incidence rate can also arise from saturation effects: if the pro-\nportion of the infectives in a population is very high, so that exposure to the disease agent is virtually\ncertain, then the transmission rate may respond more slowly than linear to the increase in the number of\ninfectives. This effect was observed, e.g. by Capasso & Serio (1978) who studied the cholera epidemic\nspread in Bari in 1973, and by Brown & Hasibuan (1995) who studied infection of the two-spotted spider\n\u2020Email: korobein@maths.ox.ac.uk\nc\u00a9 The author 2005.

MAINI\nmites, Tetranychus urticae, with the entomopathogenic fungus, Neozygites floridana. For a discrete-time\nmodel, a non-linear incidence rate can also be applied to avoid the possibility of multiple infection of\na host.\nIn recent years, a number of authors have studied epidemiological models with non-linear inci-\ndence rates. The most common non-linear incidence rate takes the form \u03b2 I p Sq (where I and S are,\nrespectively, the number of infective and susceptible individuals, and \u03b2, p and q are positive constants).\nEpidemiological models with this incidence rate have been studied by Liu et al. (1986, 1987) and later\nby Hethcote et al. (1989), Hethcote & van den Driessche (1991), Derrick & van den Driessche (1993,\n2003), Li & Muldowney (1995) and many others. More sophisticated forms of the non-linear inci-\ndence rate were also considered. For instance, Liu et al. (1986) proposed an incidence rate of the form\nk I p S\/(1 + \u03b1 I l); Briggs & Godfray (1995), who studied infection of insects, considered a non-linear\npathogen transmission of the form kS ln(1 + \u03bdP\/k) (where P is the density of the pathogen particles).\nTransmission of an infection is unknown in detail and it may be different for different infections.\nHence it appears to be reasonable to consider such properties of the system which are robust irrespect-\nive of the specific form of incidence rate. In this work, we consider the impact of a general form of\nnon-linearity for the incidence rate assuming that the incidence rate is given by an arbitrary function\nf (S, I, N ). We show that, under a few biologically feasible conditions, a non-linear incidence rate\nof quite a general form leads to a globally stable system. In Section 2, we introduce the non-linear\nincidence rate and discuss the conditions it must satisfy. In Section 3, we consider local stability of the\nequilibrium states. We consider SIRS and SEIRS models as case studies. In Section 4, we apply the\ndirect Lyapunov method to consider global stability of SIR and SEIR models with the incidence rate of\nthe form g(I ) h(S). Finally, in Section 5, we discuss our results.\n2. Non-linear incidence rate\nFollowing the classical assumptions (Anderson & May, 1991; Hethcote, 2000), we divide a population\nof constant size N into a number of classes of epidemiological significance. For instance, for SIR and\nSIRS models, these classes are the susceptibles, the infectives and recovered (or removed) with popu-\nlations denoted, respectively, by S, I and R, such that S + I + R = N . For SEIS, SEIR and SEIRS\nmodels, a class of exposed hosts (the host in a latent state, i.e. those who are already infected but are\nnot yet infectious) of size E is included, and S + E + I + R = N in this case.\nWe consider a horizontally transmitted infection.1 We postulate that the incidence rate depends on\nthe variables S, I and N only and is given by a function f (S, I, N ) continuous together with its deriva-\ntives. To be biologically feasible, the function f (S, I, N ) must satisfy the conditions\nf (S, 0, N ) = f (0, I, N ) = 0 (2.1)\nand\n\u2202 f (S, I, N )\n\u2202 I\n> 0,\n\u2202 f (S, I, N )\n\u2202S\n> 0, (2.2)\nfor all S, I > 0. We also assume that the function f (S, I, N ) is concave with respect to the variable\nI , i.e.\n\u22022 f (S, I, N )\n\u2202 I 2\n\u0001 0, for all S, I > 0. (2.3)\n1The horizontal transmission is the transmission from an infective host to a susceptible one, in contrast to the vertical transmis-\nsion from an infective mother to an unborn or newborn child; see Busenberg & Cooke (1993).\nNON-LINEAR INCIDENCE AND STABILITY 115\nThe first two conditions, (2.1) and (2.2), are obvious. The third one, the inequality (2.3), requires\nfurther discussion. Most biologically realistic non-linear incidence rates lead to a function concave with\nrespect to the number of infectives I. Thus, the condition (2.3) may be a consequence of saturation\neffects: when the number of infectives is very high so that exposure to the disease agent is virtually\ncertain, the incidence rate will respond more slowly than linearly to the increase in I . Also, a function\nconcave with respect to the number of infectives may arise as a consequence of \u201cpsychological\u201d effects:\nfor a very large number of infectives, the probability for an infective to pass the infection further may\ndecrease because the population may tend to reduce the number of contacts. For a discrete-time model, a\nnon-linear incidence rate can be applied to prevent the possibility of a multiple infection of a host. How-\never, this also leads to a disease transmission function concave with respect to the number of infectives.\nThe same result, a concave incidence rate or a disease transmission function, can be obtained if a non-\nlinear transmission function is introduced into a discrete-time model to capture the non-homogeneity of\nthe population structure, e.g. the negative binomial distribution of the infective contacts (Cullen et al.,\n2003) is associated with a distinctively concave transmission function.\nThere have been some studies for incidence rates which do not satisfy (2.3), e.g. Liu et al. (1987)\nsuggested that \u201c. . . a rate of increase faster than linear would be observed under various conditions,\nfor example, if multiple exposures to the disease vector were necessary before infection occurred.\u201d\nHowever, they provided no example of such disease. Anderson & May (1991) argue, with reference\nto Liu et al. (1987), that such a situation can arise \u201c. . . for viruses that live outside the host for only\na short time, that significant incidence levels arise only when virus concentration in the environment\nexceeds a threshold level; when I is small, the threshold is never exceeded, whereas increasing values of\nI raises the concentration above threshold.\u201d Further they also suggested that \u201c. . . for some vector-borne\ndisease, the vector may have to attack on average p individuals before acquiring a level of infective\nstages sufficient to render its next attack effective in transmitting the infection.\u201d\nConvexity of the incidence rate implies that with growth of the infective population I, the prob-\nability for a single infective individual to pass the infection further increases. Such an effect is usually\nassociated with some form of cooperation or community effect.\nIn this study, we restrict ourselves to concave non-linear incidence rates.\nFinally, since the basic reproduction number R0 of a model, i.e. the average number of secondary\ncases produced by a single infective introduced into an entirely susceptible population, is proportional\nto the limit limI\u21920,S\u2192N \u2202 f (S,I,N )\u2202 I (van den Driessche & Watmough, 2002), it is reasonable to assume\nthat\n0 <\n\u2202 f (S, I, N )\n\u2202 I\n< \u221e. (2.4)\nThis condition is not needed for our analysis, but we believe that any biologically realistic incidence\nrate should satisfy this condition. For instance, the incidence rate of the form \u03b2 I p Sq does not satisfy\nthis condition for all p unequal to one, leading to models with R0 either infinitely large or equal to 0.\nIn this paper we show that autonomous compartmental epidemiological models with a non-linear\nincidence rate satisfying conditions (2.1)\u2013(2.3) and under the constant population size assumption are\nstable. Such systems have either a unique and stable endemic equilibrium state or no endemic equilib-\nrium state at all; in the latter case, the infection-free equilibrium is stable. In fact, the condition (2.3) is\na sufficient condition for the system to be stable. We demonstrate this result using a SIRS model and a\nSEIRS model as case studies. For other compartment epidemic models, the analysis is quite analogous,\nand the same conclusion, namely stability of the steady states, holds.\n116 A. KOROBEINIKOV AND P. K. MAINI\n3. Stability of SIRS and SEIRS models\n3.1 SIRS model\nWith the incidence rate given by the function f (S, I, N ), the standard continuous-time SIRS model\n(Anderson & May, 1991; Hethcote, 2000) takes the form\nS\u02d9 = \u00b5N \u2212 f (S, I, N ) \u2212 \u00b5S + \u03b1R,\nI\u02d9 = f (S, I, N ) \u2212 \u03b4 I \u2212 \u00b5I,\nR\u02d9 = \u03b4 I \u2212 \u03b1R \u2212 \u00b5R.\nHere \u00b5 is the birth and death rate, \u03b4 is the recovery rate and \u03b1 is the loss of immunity rate. Following\nthe classical assumptions, we postulate N = S + I + R. Hence the third equation may be omitted, and\nthe first two take the form\nS\u02d9 = (\u03b1 + \u00b5)N \u2212 f (S, I, N ) \u2212 \u03b1 I \u2212 (\u03b1 + \u00b5)S,\nI\u02d9 = f (S, I, N ) \u2212 (\u03b4 + \u00b5)I.\n(3.1)\nIt is easy to see that when \u03b1 = 0 the system (3.1) is a SI R model; when \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e the system (3.1)\nreduces to a SI S model. The positive quadrant R2+ of the SI plane is the phase-space of the system.\nAt equilibrium states of the system, the equalities\nf (S, I, N ) = (\u03b4 + \u00b5)I, (3.2)\n(\u03b1 + \u00b5 + \u03b4)I + (\u03b1 + \u00b5)S = (\u03b1 + \u00b5)N (3.3)\nhold. It is easy to see that the system has an infection-free equilibrium state Q0 = (S0, I0), where S0 =\nN and I0 = 0. Apart from the infection-free equilibrium Q0, the system can have positive endemic\nequilibria states. If S\u2217 and I \u2217 are coordinates of an endemic equilibrium state Q\u2217, then the following\nLemma holds.\nLEMMA 3.1 If the conditions (2.1), (2.2) and (2.3) hold, then at the endemic equilibrium state Q\u2217 =\n(S\u2217, I \u2217)\n\u2202 f (S\u2217, I \u2217, N )\n\u2202 I\n\u0001 \u03b4 + \u00b5,\nwhere the strict equality holds only if\n\u22022 f (S\u2217, I, N )\n\u2202 I 2\n= 0, for all I \u2208 (0, I \u2217).\nProof. We observe that, by (3.1), at the endemic equilibrium state\nf (S\u2217, I \u2217, N ) = (\u03b4 + \u00b5)I \u2217,\nand twice apply the mean value theorem to the function f\u02dc (I ) = f (S\u2217, I, N ).\nAssume that\n\u2202 f (S\u2217, I \u2217, N )\n\u2202 I\n= d f\u02dc (I\n\u2217)\ndI\n> \u03b4 + \u00b5. (3.4)\nNON-LINEAR INCIDENCE AND STABILITY 117\nThen, by the mean value theorem, there is a point I1 \u2208 (0, I \u2217) such that\nd f\u02dc (I1)\ndI\n= f\u02dc (I\n\u2217) \u2212 f\u02dc (0)\nI \u2217 \u2212 0 = \u03b4 + \u00b5.\nFurthermore, if (3.4) holds, then there exists a point I0 \u2208 (I1, I \u2217) such that\n\u22022 f (S\u2217, I0, N )\n\u2202 I 2\n= d\n2 f\u02dc (I0)\ndI 2\n=\nd f\u02dc (I \u2217)\ndI \u2212 d f\u02dc (I1)dI\nI \u2217 \u2212 I1 > 0.\nThis contradicts the hypothesis of the Lemma, hence\n\u2202 f (S\u2217, I \u2217, N )\n\u2202 I\n\u0001 \u03b4 + \u00b5.\nFurthermore, the strict equality\n\u2202 f (S\u2217, I \u2217, N )\n\u2202 I\n= \u03b4 + \u00b5\nholds only if\n\u22022 f (S, I, N )\n\u2202 I 2\n= 0, for all I \u2208 (0, I \u2217), S = S\u2217. \u0002\nREMARK 3.2 Note that although we fixed the value S = S\u2217, we never use this fact in the proof. In fact,\nthe Lemma is valid for all S, I satisfying the equality (3.1). We shall use this fact later.\nWe define the basic reproduction number, i.e. the expected number of secondary cases produced by\none infective host in an entirely susceptible population (van den Driessche & Watmough, 2002) as\nR0 = 1\n\u03b4 + \u00b5\n\u2202 f (S0, I0, N )\n\u2202 I\n. (3.5)\nLEMMA 3.3 If the conditions (2.1)\u2013(2.3) hold, and if R0 > 1, then, in addition to the infection-free equi-\nlibrium state, the system (3.1) has a unique positive endemic equilibrium state Q\u2217. If R0 \u0001 1, then the\ninfection-free equilibrium Q0 is the only non-negative equilibrium of the system.\nProof. Let us consider the curve defined by the equation (3.1) on the SI plane. Since, by (2.2),\n\u2202 f (S,I,N )\n\u2202S > 0, the implicit function theorem ensures that for all S and I satisfying (3.1), there is a\none-to-one function S = h1(I ) such that\nh\u20321 =\ndS\ndI\n= \u03b4 + \u00b5 \u2212\n\u2202 f (S,I )\n\u2202 I\n\u2202 f (S,I )\n\u2202S\n.\nLemma 3.1 is valid for all S, I > 0 such that the equality (3.1) holds, and hence\nh\u20321(I ) =\ndS\ndI\n\u0003 0, for all I \u0003 0.\nEquality (3.3) defines a negatively sloped straight line h2(I ) on the SI plane (see Fig. 1). Therefore, if\nS\u2217 = h1(0) \u0001 S0 = N , then there is a unique point of intersection of the curve (3.1) and the straight\n118 A. KOROBEINIKOV AND P. K. MAINI\nFIG. 1.

Here S\u2217 = h1(0) is either a minimal value of S such that\n\u2202 f (S, 0)\n\u2202 I\n= \u03b4 + \u00b5\nholds, or, if such a value does not exist (as is e.g. in the case of a power function), S\u2217 \u2261 0. By (2.1) and\n(2.2), \u2202 f (S,0)\u2202 I is a non-decreasing function of S. Hence the condition\n\u2202 f (N , 0)\n\u2202 I\n> \u03b4 + \u00b5\nis sufficient to ensure that S\u2217 < S0 = N . \u0002\nThe following theorem is a straightforward consequence of Lemma 3.1.\nTHEOREM 3.4\n(i) If the incidence rate f (S, I, N ) satisfies the conditions (2.1), (2.2) and (2.3), and if R0 > 1, then\nthe endemic equilibrium state Q\u2217 = (S\u2217, I \u2217) of the system (3.1) is asymptotically stable.\n(ii) If R0 \u0001 1, then there is no endemic equilibrium state, and the infection-free equilibrium state is\nasymptotically stable.\nProof.\n(i) For the Jacobian J of the system (3.1), the conditions (2.2) and Lemma 3.1 ensure that at the fixed\npoint Q\u2217 = (S\u2217, I \u2217),\ndet J = (\u03b1 + \u00b5)\n(\n\u03b4 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u2202 f\n\u2202 I\n)\n+ (\u03b1 + \u03b4 + \u00b5)\u2202 f\n\u2202S\n\u0003 (\u03b1 + \u03b4 + \u00b5)\u2202 f\n\u2202S\n> 0\nNON-LINEAR INCIDENCE AND STABILITY 119\nand\n\u03bb1 + \u03bb2 = trJ = \u2202 f\n\u2202 I\n\u2212 \u03b4 \u2212 \u2202 f\n\u2202S\n\u2212 \u03b1 \u2212 2\u00b5 \u0001 \u2212\n(\n\u2202 f\n\u2202S\n+ \u03b1 + \u00b5\n)\n< 0.\nHence the real parts of the eigenvalues are negative, and the fixed point Q\u2217 is asymptotically\nstable.\n(ii) At the infection-free equilibrium Q0, by (2.1) and (3.5), \u2202 f (S0,I0)\u2202S = 0 and \u2202 f (S0,I0)\u2202 I = (\u03b4 + \u00b5)R0.\nHence at this point the eigenvalues are\n\u03bb1 = \u2212\u03b1 \u2212 \u00b5 < 0, \u03bb2 = (R0 \u2212 1)(\u03b4 + \u00b5),\ni.e. for R0 < 1 the fixed point Q0 is a stable node, at R0 = 1 a transcritical bifurcation occurs and\nwhen R0 > 1 the fixed point is a saddle point. \u0002\nThe following corollaries are obvious.\nCOROLLARY 3.5 For instability of the endemic equilibrium state, the incidence rate f (S, I, N ) must\nbe necessarily convex with respect to I at least in some points of the interval (0, I \u2217).\nProof.

If the incidence rate f (S, I, N ) satisfies the conditions (2.1), (2.2) and (2.3), then it is obvious\nthat the signs of real parts of the eigenvalues do not depend on the value of \u2202 f\u2202S . \u0002\nIf the incidence rate is convex, then the positive equilibrium state may not be unique. The dynamics\nof the system in this case can be very complex.\n3.2 SEIRS model\nAddition of the exposed state and associated with it the exposed compartment E does not affect the\nsystem stability. Let us consider a more complicated model, namely a SEIRS model. If the incidence\nrate is given by a function f (S, I, N ), then the differential equations of the model are\nS\u02d9 = (\u03b1 + \u00b5)N \u2212 f (S, I, N ) \u2212 \u03b1 I \u2212 \u03b1E \u2212 (\u03b1 + \u00b5)S,\nE\u02d9 = f (S, I, N ) \u2212 \u03b8 E \u2212 \u00b5E,\nI\u02d9 = \u03b8 E \u2212 \u03b4 I \u2212 \u00b5I.\n(3.6)\n120 A.

We assume here that the function f (S, I, N ) satisfies the\nconditions (2.1), (2.2) and (2.3), and does not depend on the exposed population E . We define the basic\nreproduction number of the system as\nR0 = \u03b8\n(\u03b8 + \u00b5)(\u03b4 + \u00b5)\n\u2202 f (S0, I0, N )\n\u2202 I\n.

The system also can have endemic equilibrium states.\nIt is easy to see that with minor changes, Lemmas 3.1 and 3.3 are valid for the system (3.6) as well.\nLEMMA 3.7 If the conditions (2.1), (2.2) and (2.3) hold, and if Q\u2217 = (S\u2217, E\u2217, I \u2217) is the endemic equi-\nlibrium state, then\n\u2202 f (S\u2217, I \u2217, N )\n\u2202 I\n\u0001 \u03b8 + \u00b5\n\u03b8\n(\u03b4 + \u00b5).\nThe strict equality holds only if\n\u22022 f (S, I, N )\n\u2202 I 2\n= 0, for all I \u2208 (0, I \u2217), S = S\u2217.\nLEMMA 3.8 If the incidence rate f (S, I, N ) satisfies the conditions (2.1), (2.2) and (2.3), and if R0 > 1,\nthen the system (3.6) has the unique infection-free equilibrium state Q0 = (S0, E0, I0) and the unique\npositive endemic equilibrium state Q\u2217 = (S\u2217, E\u2217, I \u2217). If R0 \u0001 1, then the system (3.6) has no endemic\nequilibrium state. In this case the only non-negative equilibrium of the system is the infection-free\nequilibrium Q0.\nWe omit the proofs of these Lemmas since these are the same as for Lemmas 3.1 and 3.3.

At R0 = 1 a\ntranscritical bifurcation occurs, the equilibrium Q0 loses stability and it is unstable for all R0 > 1.\nThis completes the proof. \u0002\n4. Global properties of SIR and SEIR systems\nThe majority of the incidence rates in the literature can be represented as a product of two functions,\nf (S, I ) = h(S)g(I ), where h depends only on S, and g depends only on I . It is easy to see that all the\nincidence rates mentioned in Section 1, including the mass-action incidence and the power incidence,\ncan be represented in this form. For the incidence rate of the form h(S)g(I ) satisfying the conditions\n(2.1)\u2013(2.3), the direct Lyapunov method enables us to prove global stability for some models. The direct\nLyapunov method so far is the most effective method of global analysis. However, the method requires\nan auxiliary function with specific properties, the so-called Lyapunov function. Here we construct\nLyapunov functions for SIR and SEIR systems with the incidence rate of the form h(S)g(I ).\nFor simplicity, we normalize the population size N to 1; i.e. now S, E, I and R are, respectively,\nthe fractions of the susceptibles, the exposed, the infectives and the recovered in the population, and\nS + E + I + R = 1 holds. Then the basic SI R model is\nS\u02d9 = \u00b5 \u2212 h(S) g(I ) \u2212 \u00b5S,\nI\u02d9 = h(S) g(I ) \u2212 (\u03b4 + \u00b5)I,\n(4.1)\nand the basic SEIR model is\nS\u02d9 = \u00b5 \u2212 h(S) g(I ) \u2212 \u00b5S,\nE\u02d9 = h(S) g(I ) \u2212 (\u03b8 + \u00b5)E, (4.2)\nI\u02d9 = \u03b8 E \u2212 (\u03b4 + \u00b5)I.\nHere we omit the equations for the recovered population R, and as usual we assume that the incidence\nrate satisfies the conditions (2.1), (2.2) and (2.3). The condition (2.3) ensures that each of these systems\nhas two equilibrium states: an infection-free equilibrium Q0 with the coordinates S0 = 1, E0 = I0 = 0,\nand an endemic equilibrium state Q\u2217 = (S\u2217, E\u2217, I \u2217), such that\nB(\u03b4 + \u00b5)I \u2217 = h(S\u2217)g(I \u2217), \u00b5S\u2217 + B(\u03b4 + \u00b5)I \u2217 = \u00b5, B(\u03b4 + \u00b5)I \u2217 = (\u03b8 + \u00b5)E\u2217. (4.3)\nHere B = (\u03b8 + \u00b5)\/\u03b8 for the SEIR model, and B = 1 for the SIR model.\nFor these SIR and SEIR models, we construct a Lyapunov function of the form\nV (S, E, I ) = S \u2212 h(S\u2217)\n\u222b S\na\nd\u03c4\nh(\u03c4 )\n+ B\n(\nI \u2212 g(I \u2217)\n\u222b I\na\nd\u03c4\ng(\u03c4 )\n)\n+ C(E \u2212 E\u2217 ln E). (4.4)\nHere C = 1 for the SEIR model and C = 0 for the SIR model, and B is defined above. The parameter\na, such that 0 < a \b 1, is an arbitrary positive constant which is not fixed and can be made sufficiently\nsmall. The function V (S, E, I ) is defined and continuous for all S, E, I \u0003 a.\nNON-LINEAR INCIDENCE AND STABILITY 123\nThe endemic equilibrium state Q\u2217 is the only extremum and global minimum of the function. In-\ndeed, the function V (S, E, I ) satisfies\n\u2202V\n\u2202S\n= 1 \u2212 h(S\n\u2217)\nh(S)\n,\n\u2202V\n\u2202E\n= C\n(\n1 \u2212 E\n\u2217\nE\n)\n,\n\u2202V\n\u2202 I\n= B\n(\n1 \u2212 g(I\n\u2217)\ng(I )\n)\n,\nand it is easy to see that Q\u2217 is a stationary point of the function. Since the functions h(S) and g(I ) grow\nmonotonically, the partial derivatives \u2202V\u2202S and\n\u2202V\n\u2202 I grow monotonically as well, and hence Q\u2217 is the only\nextremum of the function. Furthermore, since\n\u22022V\n\u2202S2\n= h(S\n\u2217)h\u2032(S)\n(h(S))2\n> 0,\n\u22022V\n\u2202E2\n= C E\n\u2217\nE2\n> 0 and\n\u22022V\n\u2202 I 2\n= B g(I\n\u2217)g\u2032(I )\n(g(I ))2\n> 0,\nwhereas\n\u22022V\n\u2202S\u2202E\n= \u2202\n2V\n\u2202S\u2202 I\n= \u2202\n2V\n\u2202E\u2202 I\n= 0,\nthe point Q\u2217 is the minimum. The point Q\u2217 is the only internal stationary point of the function, it is a\nminimum, and V (S, E, I ) \u2192 \u221e at the boundary. Consequently, Q\u2217 is the global minimum, the func-\ntion is bounded from below. Hence the function V (S, E, I ) is indeed a Lyapunov function (Lyapunov,\n1992).\nIn the case of the standard bilinear incidence rate \u03b2SI , the function V (S, E, I ) takes the form\nV (S, I ) = S \u2212 S\u2217 ln S + B(I \u2212 I \u2217 ln I )+ C(E \u2212 E\u2217 ln E).\nLyapunov functions of this type were constructed for three- and four-compartmental models with the\nbilinear incidence rate (Korobeinikov & Wake, 2002; Korobeinikov, 2004). For the incidence rate of the\nform \u03b2 I p Sq , the function V (S, E, I ) takes the form\nV (S, E, I ) = S + S\n\u2217\nq \u2212 1\n(\nS\u2217\nS\n)q\u22121\n+ B\n(\nI + I\n\u2217\np \u2212 1\n(\nI \u2217\nI\n)p\u22121)\n+ C(E \u2212 E\u2217 ln E);\nsuch a function was constructed for SIR and SEIR models (Korobeinikov & Maini, 2004).

It is obvious that a weaker condition (4.5) suffices for the global\nstability. The biologically feasible condition of monotonicity of the function g(I ) is not necessary to\nsatisfy the condition (4.5) either. Figure 3 shows a non-concave and non-monotonic function satisfying\nthe condition (4.5) and providing a unique extremum for V (S, E, I ), and hence ensuring global stability\nof the systems.\nWe have also to stress that the system dynamics does not depend on the function h(S) at all and is\ndetermined by the function g(I ) only. The biologically feasible monotonicity of the function h(S) is\nsufficient for global stability. Furthermore, the monotonicity is not a necessary condition either: in fact,\nfor global stability, it is necessary that h(S) > h(S\u2217) for all S > S\u2217, and h(S) < h(S\u2217) for all S < S\u2217;\nthis also ensures the uniqueness of the extremum of the function V (S, E, I ).\nNON-LINEAR INCIDENCE AND STABILITY 127\n5. Discussion and conclusion\nIn this paper we considered the dynamics of epidemiological models with incidence rate f (S, I, N )\nconcave with respect to the number of infectives, i.e. satisfying the condition\n\u22022 f (S, I, N )\n\u2202 I 2\n\u0001 0. (5.1)\nThe main result of this paper is that this condition, the concavity of the incidence rate, ensures unique-\nness of the endemic equilibrium state and its stability. We should stress that this result is valid for autono-\nmous models and with the assumption of constant population size.\nIt also follows that to have unstable non-trivial (positive) equilibria, the incidence rate f (S, I, N )\nmust necessarily be convex with respect to the variable I, at least in some points.\nAcknowledgement\nA.
