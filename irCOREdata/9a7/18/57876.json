Introduction\nAccurate taxonomy and sample identification are crucial to analyses the ecology and85\nevolution of species, higher-level taxonomic groups and communities.  Morphological\ntaxonomy has long been used to define species using consistent differences in external\ncharacters, but the scale of the challenge of identifying and classifying all species in this way\nis prohibitive (Tautz et al. 2003).  While approximately 1.5 million, predominantly insect,\nspecies have been described to date (de Meeus & Renaud, 2002), these represent only a small90\nproportion of estimated global diversity and molecular studies continue to reveal cryptic taxa\ninseparable on the basis of morphological taxonomy (e.g. Papakostas et al., 2005; Smith et\nal., 2006; Bergmann & Russell, 2007; Smith et al., 2007; Starrett & Hedin, 2007), increasing\nthe magnitude of the challenge.\nApproaches based on genetic markers, particularly DNA sequence data, are95\nincreasingly used to augment or replace morphological taxonomic analyses (Tautz et al.\n2003). As discussed by Vogler and Monaghan (2006), at least 3 conceptually different but\nrelated approaches have been used. DNA taxonomy uses patterns of variation in DNA\nsequence data to define taxa a priori, without reference to morphological data, though it can\nenable the identification of diagnostic morphological characters. This approach uses no pre-100\ndefined level of difference (e.g. % sequence divergence) to define taxa, but attempts to\nidentify idependently evolving lineages. Because the topology of an individual gene tree can\ndiffer significantly from population and species trees, identification of such lineages is best\napproached using data for multiple loci (Meyer & Paulay 2005; Hickerson et al. 2006; Vogler\n& Monaghan 2006). A second approach captures the sequence diversity present in a group of105\nsamples by identifying molecular operational taxonomic units (or MOTUs; Floyd et al.,\n2002), defined as a group of sequences differing from one another by a specified maximum\nnumber of base pairs (Blaxter 2004). MOTU richness is a useful summary measure of\nsequence diversity,  particularly in describing samples of morphologically cryptic taxa.\n5However, MOTU approaches have the drawback in comparison with DNA taxonomy that the110\nlink between MOTU membership and biological species status remains unclear (Vogler &\nMonaghan 2006).\nDNA barcoding is the third approach, and rather than defining taxa a priori, it uses\nsequence similarity at a single \u2018barcode\u2019 locus (in Metazoa, usually the mitochondrial locus\ncytochrome c oxidase subunit I, coxI) to allocate unknown specimens to morphologically115\ndetermined voucher taxa (Floyd et al. 2002; Blaxter 2004; Hebert et al., 2004; Powers, 2004;\nBlaxter et al., 2005; Hajibabaei et al., 2005; Lambert et al., 2005; Ward et al., 2005). The\nunderlying rationale for DNA barcoding is that sequence variation among species is greater\nthan (and discrete from) variation within species: in other words, that sequence variation at\nthe selected locus shows a \u2018barcoding gap\u2019 (Fig.1). Given this assumption,  unidentified120\nspecimens that differ by less than a threshold sequence divergence (operationally taken as 2%\nfor coxI in Metazoa; Hebert et al. 2003 and see http:\/\/www.barcodinglife.com) from voucher\nsequence for a reference species can be allocated to that species, and sequences more\ndivergent than the selected threshold from any reference taxon will be allocated to a new\nspecies (Hebert et al., 2003).  This approach can be effective in revealing morphologically125\ncryptic taxa, and so inform revision of morphological taxonomy (e.g. e.g. Smith et al., 2006;\nChallis et al., 2007; Smith et al., 2007; Stone et al., 2008).\nHowever, there are major potential drawbacks of using a single mitochondrial barcode\nmarker in this way. Coalescent theory predicts that both intraspecific sequence diversity and\nthe probability of shared barcode sequences among discrete biological species will be130\nsensitive to population demography, particularly species age and past effective population\nsize (Moritz & Cicero 2004; Meyer & Paulay 2005; Hickerson et al. 2006; Nielsen & Matz\n2006; Knowles & Carstens 2007). Young species with large effective population sizes are\npredicted not to be monophyletic for their barcode sequence, and where past population sizes\nvary substantially within a group of taxa, a single threshold divergence is unlikely to separate135\n6intraspecific variation from varation among species \u2013 in other words, there may be no\nbarcoding gap (Funk & Omland 2003; DeSalle et al., 2005; Meyer & Paulay, 2005; Cognato\n2006; Vogler & Monaghan, 2006; Rubinoff, 2006). Heteroplasmy, introgression (with or\nwithout selective sweeps imposed by Wolbachia and other symbionts), potential selection on\nnucleotides, and the existence of nuclear pseudogenes can all lead to conflicts between140\nspecies membership and grouping by DNA barcode (Hebert et al., 2004; Hurst & Jiggins,\n2005). DNA barcoding is thus best used where (i) the presence of a barcoding gap for the\nbarcoding locus can be demonstrated empirically, and (ii) concordance in gene tree topology\ncan be demonstrated between the barcoding locus and at least one nuclear locus (Blaxter,\n2004; Ahrens et al. 2007; Smith et al., 2007; Cardoso et al. 2009). More broadly, the utility of145\nDNA barcoding is arguably greatest where existing morphological taxonomic expertise\nallows molecular and morphological approaches to be compared, revealing the shortfalls of\ntraditional approaches but providing biological context to sequence-based taxa (e.g. Cardoso\net al. 2009).\nHere we examine the molecular taxonomy and potential for single locus DNA150\nbarcoding of\na group of insects whose morphological taxonomy is problematic \u2013 the inquiline gallwasps of\nthe tribe Synergini (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae).\n1.1 The inquiline gallwasps155\nThe tribe Synergini contains ca. 170 species that inhabit plant galls induced by other\ninsects \u2013 primarily other gallwasps (Cynipidae; reviewed in Cs\u00f3ka et al. 2005). The inquilines\nare highly specialised herbivores, able to modify the host plant tissues on which they feed, but\ndependent on true gall inducers to initiate gall formation (agastoparasites sensu Ronquist\n1994; Brooks & Shorthouse, 1998; Sanver & Hawkins, 2000; Stone et al., 2002b). They160\n7attack the galls of hosts in the gallwasp tribes Cynipini (oak gallwasps, hosts to the inquiline\ngenera Ceroptres, Saphonecrus, Synergus, Synophrus and Ufo), Diplolepidini (rose gallwasps,\nhosts to the inquiline genus Periclistus) and Aylacini (herb gallwasps, hosts to the inquiline\ngenus Synophromorpha) (Ronquist, 1994, 1999; Cs\u00f3ka et al., 2005). The major exception to\nattack of cynipid hosts is the inquiline genus Rhoophilus, whose single species inhabits galls165\ninduced by Cecidosid moths on Rhus species (sumacs; van Noort et al., 2006).\nGall communities have been the subjects of numerous studies of community structure\nand evolution (Stone et al., 2002; Stone & Sch\u00f6nrogge, 2003; Stone et al., 2009; Bailey et al.,\n2009), and cynipid inquilines have a major impact on food web structure and community\nspecies richness (Sch\u00f6nrogge et al., 1995, 1996a, b; Sch\u00f6nrogge & Crawley, 2000; Stone et170\nal., 2002). The morphological taxonomy of the inquilines has been studied in depth (Mayr\n1872; Wiebes-Rijks, 1979; Nieves-Aldrey & Pujade-Villar, 1985, 1986; Pujade-Villar &\nNieves-Aldrey, 1990, 1993; Liljeblad & Ronquist, 1998; Nieves-Aldrey 2001; Pujade-Villar\net al., 2003). On the basis of morphology, the most species-rich genus, Synergus, is divided\ninto two sections (Sections I and II; Mayr 1872) that also differ in in a range of biological175\ntraits. Section I species are predominantly univoltine, and their development in a host gall is\nrarely lethal to the gall-inducer. In contrast, Section II species are predominantly bivoltine,\nand their development in a host gall often kills the gall inducer (Cs\u00f3ka et al., 2005). Section II\nspecies are also characterised by high between-generation variation in some adult\nmorphological attributes, particularly size and colour (Nieves-Aldrey & Pujade-Villar, 1986;180\nPujade-Villar, 1992; Wiebes-Rijks, 1979), which can make morphology-based identification\ndifficult. As a result, morphology-based identification of adults is often only possible to\ncomplexes of morphologically similar species, and identification of most immature stages,\ndesirable in food web analyses, is currently impossible. Demonstration of effective DNA\nbarcoding in this group would thus greatly facilitate the generation of more comprehensive185\nfood web data.\n8Here we assess the utility of two mitochondrial loci (coxI and cytochrome b, cytb) and\none nuclear locus (the D2 region of the 28S ribosomal RNA gene) in resolving the\nrelationships among inquiline oak gallwasp lineages, incorporating data for over 80% of\nrecognised Western Palaearctic species and all recognised genera.  We examine the190\nconcordance between mitochondrial and nuclear gene trees, particularly important here\nbecause two processes known to influence mitochondrial sequence diversity - introgression\nand infection with Wolbachia symbionts \u2013 occur in inquiline and gall inducing Cynipini\n(Rokas et al., 2001, 2002a, 2003a, b). We choose 28S D2 as the nuclear locus because it has\nproven valuable in resolving species level relationships in cynipids in the past, and in contrast195\nto alternatives such as long wavelength opsin and elongation factor 1, it can be amplified with\nhighly conserved primers (see Methods: problematic for long wavelength opsin in some\ncynipids: Stone et al., 2009) and does not require cloning (sometimes required for opsin and\nelongation factor 1; Rokas et al., 2002b; Stone  et al., 2009). The need for further\nphylogenetic analysis of oak inquiline gallwasps is supported by the fact that although200\nprevious analyses support monophyly for the complex as a whole (Ronquist, 1994; Ronquist\n& Liljeblad, 2001; Nylander et al., 2004a, b; Nieves-Aldrey et al., 2005), the genera and\nspecies within the complex are difficult to distinguish morphologically (Pujade-Villar et al.,\n2003). Though some species in this complex have been included in previous molecular\nphylogenetic analyses (e.g. Rokas et al., 2002b; Nylander et al., 2004a, b; P\u00e9nzes et al.,205\n2009), sampling of Synergus has been very limited. A recent molecular analysis of the genera\nSynophrus and Saphonecrus (P\u00e9nzes et al., 2009) revealed the possible diphyly of the genus\nSaphonecrus, though placement of these genera relative to Synergus was not investigated. We\naddress the following questions: (a) Are the genera Synophrus, Saphonecrus and Synergus\nmonophyletic groups, and what are the phylogenetic relationships between them? (b) are210\nSections I and II of Synergus monophyletic groups? If yes, then diagnostic biological traits\nhave been conserved within two divergent lineages. Rejection of section monophyly would\n9imply that biological trait evolution in Synergus is more labile than currently accepted. (c) Is\nthere evidence of morphologically cryptic sequence diversity, suggesting the need for revision\nof current estimates of taxon diversity?215\nWe then explore the potential for DNA barcoding in the oak-associated Synergini.\nFirst, we assess the empirical support for a barcoding gap in coxI and cytb. Rather than\nassuming a single cut-off threshold for definition of MOTUs (e.g. 2% sequence divergence\nfor coxI), for the two mitochondrial genes we examine the impact of variation in the cutoff\nthreshold from 0-12% on MOTU membership. Because MOTU richness and composition can220\nbe sensitive to taxon sampling (Meyer & Paulay, 2005), we also explore the impact of\nsampled sequence diversity on MOTU richness. We address the following additional\nquestions: (d) Do coxI MOTUs capture Linnean species? If not, are separate Linnean species\nrepresented by sequences in the same MOTU (Type I error sensu Quicke, 2004)? (e) Do coxI\nbarcodes reveal cryptic taxa unrecognised by existing morphology-based taxonomy (Type II225\nerror sensu Quicke, 2004)? (f) To what extent are MOTUs identified using coxI sequence data\nconcordant with those supported by cytb and 28S D2?  (g) To what extent is MOTU\nmembership sensitive to the number of sequences included in the analysis?\n2. Materials and methods230\n2.1 Taxon sampling\nBecause tests of the efficacy of DNA barcoding are highly dependent on thorough taxon\nsampling (Meyer & Paulay 2005), we sampled as many of the described species of Western\nPalaearctic Synergini associated with oak cynipid hosts as possible. We obtained data for 184\nspecimens (see supplementary on-line Appendix S1) comprising 33 of the 41 described235\nspecies (>80%: 2\/2 Ceroptres, 6\/6 Saphonecrus, 23\/30 Synergus, 2\/3 Synophrus; Cs\u00f3ka et al.,\n10\n2005; Sadeghi et al., 2006). Because the ability of DNA barcodes to assign individuals to\nspecies requires adequate sampling of intraspecific as well as interspecific variation (Moritz\n& Cicero, 2004; Morando et al., 2003), where possible we incorporated samples from\nmultiple refugial centres of intraspecific diversity (Rokas et al., 2003b) across the Western240\nPalaearctic from Spain to Iran (Appendix S1). Sampling was strongest for Synergus, in which\n11 species were represented by four or more coxI sequences, and four species (S. hayneanus,\nS. pallicornis, S. pallipes and S. umbraculus) were represented by between 10 and 15\nsequences (Appendix S1). Examination of conflicts between Linnean species designation and\ncoxI MOTU membership is thus restricted to Synergus.245\n Unsampled species are either extremely local in distribution, such that we were unable\nto obtain samples (Synophrus olivieri, Synergus ibericus, S. ilicinus, S. ruficornis, S.\nsubterraneus Pujade-Villar et al. 2003) or are morphologically very similar to (and probable\nsynonyms of) sampled species (S. dacianus of the sampled species S. crassicornis; S.\nsynophri of the sampled species S. hayneanus; and S. radiatus of the sampled S. pallipes).  All250\nsampled inquilines were reared from oak galls, except for Rhoophilus loewi, which was reared\nfrom Scyrotis sp. (Lepidoptera, Cecidosidae) galls induced on Rhus in South Africa.\nSpecimens were identified by Melika and Pujade-Villar, recognised experts in the field of\nmorphological cynipid taxonomy and the authors of the existing keys (Pujade-Villar et al.,\n2003).  Due to difficulties in morphological identification, some individual specimens were255\nassigned >1 morphospecies name (see Appendix S1). The Eastern Palaearctic (Abe et al.,\n2007) and Nearctic (Burks, 1979) inquiline faunas are far less known. To begin the process of\nassessing relationships between these regional faunas, and in particular to explore whether\nWestern Palaearctic MOTUs span the palaearctic into Asia, our analysis incorporates two\nSynergus species from China (Synergus chinensis and S. xiaolongmeni; det. G. Melika)260\n(Melika et al. 2004), and one from Japan (Synergus japonicus; det. Y. Abe).\n11\n2.2 DNA Extraction and Sequencing\nDNA was extracted from a single hind leg of most specimens using a simple Chelex-\nbased protocol (Lopez-Vaamonde et al. 2001). Based on prior experience (though not a hard265\nand fast rule), for insects less than 2 mm long we extracted DNA from the whole wasp using\nthe DNeasy Tissue Kit (QIAGEN cat. 69504).\nFor cytochrome b (cytb), we first used the following primers: forward primer, CB1\nTATGTACTACCATGAGGACAAATATC, reverse primer, CB2\nATTACACCTCCTAATTTATTAGGAAT (Jermiin & Crozier, 1994). Where amplification270\nusing the CB1\/CB2 primer pair failed, an overlapping fragment was amplified using the\nCP1\/CP2 primer pair: CP1 GATGATGAAATTGGATC, CP2\nCTAATGCAATAACTCCTCC (Harry et al., 1998). For cytochrome c oxidase subunit I\n(coxI), we used forward primer, LCO1490 GGTCAACAAATCATAAAGATATTGG, and\nreverse primer HCO2198  TAAACTTCAGGGTGACCAAAAAAT (Folmer et al., 1994). For275\nthe D2 region of the nuclear 28S ribosomal RNA gene, we used forward primer\nCGTGTTGCTTGATAGTGCAGC, and reverse primer TCAAGACGGGTCCTGAAAGT\n(Heraty et al. 2004). We also amplified the D3-5 region of the 28S ribosomal RNA gene,\nusing forward primer ACACACTCCTTAGCGGA, and reverse primer\nGACCCGTCTTGAAACACGGA (Friedrich & Tautz, 1995).280\nFor all loci, 25 \u00b5l polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were carried out in a PTC-200\nDNA Engine (MJ Research) using 1 U Taq polymerase (Invitrogen or Promega), 2.5 \u00b5l 10x\nTaq buffer, 1.5 \u00b5l MgCl2 (25 mM), 0.5 \u00b5l dNTPs (10 mM), 0.35 \u00b5l primers (20 pmol), 1.0 \u00b5l\ntemplate DNA and 18.85 \u00b5l dH2O. PCR products were purified using shrimp alkaline\nphosphatase and E. coli exonuclease I (USB Corporation, USA) and sequenced directly on an285\nautomated ABI Prism 3730 Genetic Analyzer machine using ABI BigDye v3.1 Terminator\nSequencing chemistry.  All PCR products were sequenced in both directions to minimise PCR\nartefacts, ambiguities and base-calling errors.   Chromatogram output was checked by eye\n12\nusing Sequencher 4.1 (Gene Codes) or ProSeq (Filatov, 2002).  Direct sequencing of a small\nproportion of the cytb PCR products revealed mixtures of multiple cytb-like fragments, or290\nsequences possessing reading frames containing stop codons or indels, suggesting the possible\npresence of nuclear pseudogenes (Bensasson et al. 2001, Rokas et al., 2003a). In these cases,\nindividual PCR products were amplified by cloning (TA cloning, Invitrogen) and only\nspecimens for which a single, correct open reading frame (ORF) bearing sequence was\nidentified have been included in the following analyses. Though heterozygotes have been295\ndetected for the 28S D2 region in cynipids (e.g. Stone et al., 2007) and other taxa (e.g. Smith\net al. 2008), none were detected in our surveys.\nOur analysis incorporates 404 new sequences (coxI, 106; cytb, 143; 28S D2, 108; 28S\nD3-5, 47), with Genbank accession numbers in Appendix S1. Of the 184 Synergini specimens\nin the study, 70 had full sequences for all three genes (cytb, coxI and 28S D2). The 67 discrete300\nhaplotype sets in these specimens comprise the maxtaxa dataset.\n2.3 Phylogenetic Analyses\n2.3.1 Alignment and phylogeny reconstruction\nAll coxI (660 bp) and cytb (433 bp) sequences were the same length, and each gene set305\ncould be aligned unambiguously by eye. The 28S fragments were of variable length (D2: 520-\n572 bp, D3-5: 511-513 bp) and were aligned using MUSCLE 3.6 (Edgar 2004) using default\nsettings. There was very little sequence variation in the D3-5 region, and we do not consider it\nfurther. Bayesian phylogenetic inference was performed in MrBayes 3.1.2 (Ronquist &\nHuelsenbeck 2003).  Phylogenies for individual genes and for combined gene datasets were310\nconstructed under the GTR+I+G model of sequence evolution, partitioned by codon position\nfor cox1 and cytb. For each data matrix, two independent Markov chain Monte Carlo\n(MCMC) runs of four Metropolis-coupled chains were performed with the gamma shape\n13\nparameter, the proportion of invariant sites, base frequencies and substitution rates unlinked\nacross all partitions, and with default priors. MCMC runs comprised either 4 million (cox1,315\n28S D2) or 8 million (cytb) generations, sampled every 1000 generations with a burn-in time\nof 3 or 7 million generations, respectively.  Models were considered to have converged when\nthe average standard deviation of split frequencies between the two independent runs fell\nbelow 0.01, and chain parameters examined in Tracer v1.4 (Rambaut & Drummond 2007)\nshowed stable distributions.  All trees were rooted using Ceroptres clavicornis, since previous320\nstudies spanning multiple tribes of Cynipinae (Nylander et al. 2004a) have shown this genus\nto represent a lineage distinct from the Synergus complex.\nBecause molecular clock assumptions can significantly influence clade support, we\ncompared support for clock and non-clock models for each gene in MrBayes using ln Bayes\nfactors (ln BF). These were estimated as twice the difference in the natural log of the325\nharmonic mean of model likelihoods of each model (2\u0394lnHML), interpreted following Table\n2 of Kass & Raftery (1995). By their criteria, ln BF of 2-6, 6-10 and >10 represent\nrespectively positive, strong and very strong support for the model with higher likelihood. All\nthree molecular markers showed sequence variation consistent with strict clock assumptions\n(ln BF in favour of a clock model for cox1=32; cytb =227, 28S D2=221).330\n2.3.2 Tests of taxon monophyly\nSupport for the monophyly of specific taxa was tested by using MrBayes and Bayes\nfactors as above to compare the harmonic mean likelihoods of models in which taxon\nmonophyly was constrained with models in which there was no such constraint.335\n2.3.3 Likelihood mapping\nLikelihood mapping (Strimmer & von Haeseler, 1997) provides an estimate of the\nphylogenetic utility of a set of sequences, and was performed in TreePuzzle 5.0 (Schmidt et\n14\nal., 2002) using the HKY model of nucleotide substitution.  Likelihood maps were constructed340\nfor each gene with parameters estimated from the data set and using all possible quartets of\ntaxa.\n2.4 CoxI MOTU analyses\nMOTUs were defined for the complete set of unique coxI haplotypes at cut-off values\nranging from 1-100 base pairs (ca. 0-12% sequence divergence) using MOTU_define 2.04345\n(Floyd & Blaxter, 2006).  MOTU_define clusters input sequences into MOTUs by adding\neach sequence in turn to a local BLAST database and then taking the next sequence and\nperforming a BLAST similarity search against the entries in the local database.  If the\nsequence has less than the user-defined cut-off number of differences to an existing MOTU\nthen it is added to that MOTU, otherwise it is assigned to a new MOTU.  The grouping of350\nsequences in this way is sensitive to the order in which they are added (Blaxter et al., 2005) so\n100 replicates using different random resampling orders were performed for each MOTU cut-\noff.\nTo examine the impact of sampling depth on MOTU richness and membership, we\ncompared the results obtained from analysis of the maxdata supermatrix (matrix containing355\ndata for all 3 loci) with those obtained for a second supermatrix intended to maximise\nsequence diversity present in all three loci, while minimising the number of specimens with\nmissing data. Starting from the maxdata supermatrix, this maxtaxa supermatrix was\nconstructed by adding all specimens that either individually contributed a unique new\nhaplotype for at least one gene, or represented a novel combination of existing haplotypes.360\nWhere two individuals shared a haplotype not present in the maxdata supermatrix, we added\ndata for specimens sequenced for two genes in preference to those sequenced for one. This\napproach resulted in addition of data for 58 specimens, resulting in a  supermatrix containing\nsequence for 125 specimens, almost doubling the specimen sample size. The maxtaxa matrix\nlacked data for 100 of the 375 gene sequences making up the alignment, representing 26.7%365\n15\nmissing data.\n3. Results\n3.1 Phylogenetic Relationships within the Synergus complex\n3.1.1 Phylogenetic utility of coxI, cytb and 28S D2370\nAll three molecular markers used in phylogeny reconstruction had high phylogenetic\nutility, all showing fewer than 10% of quartets in the unresolved central portion of the\nlikelihood map (Figure 2).  CoxI had the highest phylogenetic utility, with 95.8% of quartets\nin the well-resolved regions towards the corners, followed by cytb (92.9%) and 28S D2\n(86.4%).375\n3.1.2 Relationships among major lineages of the Synergus complex\nAll three genes supported broadly concordant relationships among major lineages\n(Figs. 3-5 for coxI, cytb and 28S D2 respectively). All three genes supported monophyly of\nthe large genus Synergus. Bayes factor comparisons strongly supported monophyly in the380\ncoxI data (Fig.3), while the cytb and 28S D2 data were equivocal (Table 1). Synergus was\nnevertheless supported as monophyletic with a posterior probability of >0.95 in the 28S D2\nreconstruction (Fig.5). All three genes supported monophyly for the small genus Synophrus\n(the posterior probability of monophyly is 1.0 in all analyses; Figs. 3-5), but while\nSaphonecrus monophyly was supported (albeit weakly) by the cytb data (Fig.4), monophyly385\nwas rejected rather more strongly by coxI and 28S D2 (Table 1). Both coxI and 28S D2 divide\nSaphonecrus into two (Figs. 3,5): three species (Saphonecrus barbotini, S. connatus and S.\nlusitanicus) form part of a monophyletic clade including all sampled Synophrus species, while\nthe remaining Western Palaearctic species (Saphonecrus haimi, S. undulatus and a recently\ndescribed species S. irani) represent a separate lineage (the \u2018haimi clade\u2019 Figs. 3, 5).  Which390\n16\nof these two lineages is the sister group to Synergus remains poorly resolved in each of the\nsingle gene datasets, while the haimi clade of Saphonecrus is strongly supported (posterior\nprobability >0.95) as the sister group in an analysis incorporating data for all three genes\n(Fig.S1).\n395\n3.1.3 Synergus shows extensive non-monophyly of morphology-based taxa\nAll three genes very strongly rejected monophyly of Hartig\u2019s sections I and II within\nSynergus (Table 1, Figs. 3-5). This implies that the biological traits characteristic of species in\nthese sections are evolutionarily labile within this genus. There are also conflicts in Synergus\nbetween morphological and molecular taxa at the level of Linnean species. Bayes factor400\ncomparisons for all three genes rejected monophyly of hapotypes attributed to S. hayneanus,\nS. pallipes and S. umbraculus (highlighted in Figs. 3-5, Table 1). Phylogenetically divergent\nhaplotypes in all 3 genes were also attributed to Synergus flavipes (Figs. 3-5).\n3.1.4 Placement of Eastern Palaearctic taxa405\nAll single gene datasets show Chinese Synergus chinensis and S. xiaolongmeni and\nJapanese Synergus japonicus to represent distinct lineages nested among the Western\nPalaearctic lineages. There is no evidence to suggest that Eastern and Western Palaearctic\nSynergus represent discrete monophyletic radiations.\n3.2 MOTU Analysis410\n3.2.1 CoxI and cytb both show evidence of a barcoding gap\nThe relationship between numbers of MOTUs and the percentage sequence divergence\nused to define them is shown for all three genes in Figure 6. Both coxI and cytb show a\nplateau of MOTU richness over a range of cut-off values compatible with the presence of a\n17\n\u2018barcoding gap\u2019. Because there is no formal way to define the margins of a barcoding gap, we415\nexamined MOTU composition across a range of cutoff values spanning the barcoding gap for\neach gene (indicated on Fig.6). For coxI, the selected sequence divergence values were 1.1%\n(most divisive, \u2018splitter\u2019), 3.8% (midpoint) and 6.4% (most inclusive, \u2018lumper\u2019), equivalent to\ndivergences of  7, 25 and 42 base pairs (bp) and labelled A-C on Fig.6. The equivalent values\nfor cytb were 2.1, 4.4 and 6.2% (equivalent to 9, 19 and 27 bp, points D-F, Fig.6). There is420\nlittle evidence of a barcoding gap in the 28S D2 sequences, and to allow comparison of\nMOTU membership across the 3 genes, we selected a cut-off value of 2 bp (equivalent to 0.04\n% sequence divergence, point G, Fig.6).\n3.2.2 cox1 MOTUs and discordance with morphological taxonomy425\nThe 98 coxI sequences assigned 31 Synergus complex species to 27 MOTUs at the\ninclusive 6.4% cut-off (Appendix 1, Fig.S1), comprising 13 clusters and 14 singleton\nhaplotypes (six of which were found in more than one individual).  Comparison of\nmorphology-based species identification with MOTU designations at this cut-off revealed that\nthough many MOTU\u2019s corresponded to recognised Linnean species, there was also substantial430\ndiscordance: six MOTUs (Table 2) contained samples representing more than one\nmorphospecies (Type I error), while six species are represented by samples in more than one\nMOTU (Type II error) (Table 3).\nThe divisive 1.1% cut-off assigned the same haplotypes to 40 MOTUs, comprising 20\nclusters and 20 singleton haplotypes (eight of which were found in more than one sample).435\nAt this cut-off, only 4 MOTUs contained more than 1 species (Table 2), while 8 species were\npresent in more than one MOTU (Table 3). Significantly for our inference of tupe 1 and type\n2 errors, the specimens contributing to conflicts between morphological taxonomy and\nMOTU allocations were the same regardless of cut-off level, and included the non-\nmonophyletic species described in section 3.1.3. The morphospecies most commonly grouped440\n18\ntogether in a single MOTU were (i) Synergus gallaepomiformis, S. pallicornis and S. pallipes\n(all in Mayr Section II), grouped with S. pallidipennis (Section I) in MOTU 20, and (ii)\nSynergus flavipes, S. hayneanus and S. umbraculus (all in Mayr Section I) in MOTU 19\n(Table 2, text Appendix 1). The species most frequently allocated to multiple MOTUs were\nSynergus hayneanus (Section I; 4 MOTUs at 42bp, 5 MOTUs at 7bp), S. pallipes (Section II;445\n3 and 4 MOTUs, respectively) and S. umbraculus (Section I; 2 and 5 MOTUs, respectively)\n(Table 3). Although Section II of Synergus is charactersised by greater intraspecific\nmorphological diversity (see 1.1, above), there is no evidence that either Type I or Type II\nerrors are more common in this section.\n450\n3.2.3 MOTU concordance across sampled genes\nThe three genes in our analysis identify highly concordant sets of MOTUs in the\nmaxdata alignment (Appendix 2). At the inclusive cut-off (6.4% for coxI, 6.2% for cytb),\n8\/14 clusters and all singletons inferred with the 67 distinct coxI sequences were also inferred\nwith cytb (Appendix 2). MOTUs defined by coxI were more stable over a range of cut-off455\nvalues than those defined by cytb, apparent in Fig.6 as the flatter plateau between points A-C\nfor cox1 than between points D-F for cytb.\nComparison between coxI (6.4%) and 28S D2 (2 bp, 0.04 %) gave the strongest\nagreement of all between-gene comparisons.  The 28S D2 data support 10\/14 of the coxI\nclusters and all of the coxI singletons (Appendix 2). This agreement in MOTU definition460\nbetween genes supports the conclusion that the disagreement revealed between morphology-\nand sequence-based taxa is genuine, and unlikely to be an artefact associated with the use of a\nparticular sequence to define molecular taxa.\n3.2.4 MOTU designation is robust to variation in taxon sampling and missing data465\n19\nAll MOTUs inferred with greater than 50% support for each of the genes using the\nmaxdata set (67 specimens) were also inferred using the maxtaxa set (125 specimens; see\nAppendices 1 and 2). Addition of the 58 extra maxtaxa sequences had little impact on levels\nof Type I (the number of MOTUs containing >1 species) and Type II (the number of species\nin >1 MOTU) errors; each increased by 1 relative to values at corresponding cut-offs for the470\nmaxdata matrix, and involved almost identical sets of Linnean species (one additional\nMOTU containing two Linnean species is inferred in the maxtaxa dataset; Tables 2,3).\n4. Discussion\n4.1 Phylogenetic relationships within the Synergus complex475\nOur analyses provide well-resolved phylogenetic hypotheses for relationships between\nmajor lineages within the Synergus complex, but reveal widespread conflict with existing\ngroupings based on morphology. While the genera Synergus and Synophrus are probably\nmonophyletic, Saphonecrus is probably diphyletic. Our results thus confirm earlier doubts\nover the monophyly of this genus (Pujade-Villar & Nieves-Aldrey, 1990; P\u00e9nzes et al., 2009).480\nThe three Saphonecrus species allied to Synophrus (S. barbotini, S. connatus and S.\nlusitanicus) could reasonably be transferred to the genus Synophrus, while the distinct lineage\ncomprising Saphonecrus haimi and S. undulatus could retain the genus name Saphonecrus.\nWithin Synergus, we find no separation between Western Palaearctic taxa and our very\nlimited sampling of three Eastern Palaearctic species from China and Japan. We find that485\nMayr\u2019s long-accepted morphology-based sections within the genus Synergus do not represent\nnatural groups, and should be abandoned. The character used by Mayr to separate the two\nsections of Synergus - the dorso-ventral distribution of sculpturing on tergites of the\nmetasoma (the abdomen behind the petiole) \u2013 is clearly relatively labile evolutionarily, and of\nno taxonomic use.490\n20\n4.2 The potential utility of coxI barcodes for the Synergus complex\nThe widely used Folmer barcode region of the mitochondrial coxI gene appears to\nshow a clear barcoding gap in the Synergus complex. MOTUs defined with this coxI region\nare relatively stable across a range of cut-off values representing 1.1-6.4% sequence495\ndivergence, and in many cases MOTU membership reflects current membership of Linnean\nspecies. The resampling inherent in MOTU_define and comparison of results for the\nmaxdata and maxtaxa analyses also shows that the compositions of the coxI MOTUs are\nalso relatively insensitive to sampling order and variation in haplotype sampling effort. There\nhas rightly been widespread criticism of the assumption of a single sequence divergence500\nthreshold in a single locus in discriminating between biological species (see 4.3). We suggest\nthat the stability of coxI MOTU membership and the congruence in MOTU membership\nacross mitochondrial and nuclear genes supports the use of coxI barcodes in the Synergus\ncomplex.\n505\n4.3 Mismatches between morphological taxonomy and MOTU membership in Synergus\nWhile some recognised Synergus species correspond to coxI MOTUs over the full range of\ncut-offs investigated here, others clearly do not. MOTU-based groupings suggest that both\nType I errors (separation into discrete taxa where none exists) and Type II errors (cryptic\nlineages within single morphological species) (Quicke, 2004) exist in the Synergus complex.510\nThere are two general hypotheses for such mismatches between morphological taxonomy and\nMOTU membership: (i) that MOTU-based identification is correct, while identification based\non morphological traits is flawed, and (ii) that MOTU-based identification is flawed, while\nidentification based on morphological traits is correct. The latter hypothesis predicts a\nmismatch between specimen groupings based on mitochondrial sequence data and those515\nbased on nuclear sequence data. There are many reasons to expect such a mismatch (Hudson\n21\n& Turelli, 2003; Machado and Hey, 2003; Moritz & Cicero, 2004; Hurst & Jiggins, 2005). In\nparticular, coalescent theory predicts that species can share coxI barcodes through incomplete\nsorting of ancestral polymorphism (Hickerson et al., 2006; Knowles & Carstens, 2007), and\nmany species are polyphyletic rather than monophyletic for mitochondrial genes (Johnson &520\nCicero 2002; Funk & Omland, 2003; Meyer & Paulay, 2005). Where sorting of ancestral\npolymorphism is complete, species can still share barcodes through introgression (Machado\nand Hey, 2003; Hurst & Jiggins 2005). Exchange of mitochondrial genes by introgression has\nbeen demonstrated in gall inducing cynipids (Rokas et al. 2003b), and might thus be expected\nin inquiline gallwasps. These pitfalls of relying on a single mitochondrial locus in molecular525\nbarcoding are the same as those associated with its use in phylogeography, and can be\navoided by using multiple unlinked nuclear loci to determine affinities between specimens\n(e.g. Knowles & Carstens, 2007; Starrett & Hedin, 2007). Although we have only used one\nnuclear locus here, the agreement in MOTU memberships between coxI and 28S D2 datasets\ndespite the much lower levels of sequence variation in the nuclear locus (see also Rokas et al.,530\n2002b; Blaxter, 2004; Ahrens et al. 2007) gives greater confidence that the MOTUs capture\nbiologically meaningful entities.\nIf the molecular taxa identified here do represent discrete biological entities, then the\nmorphological taxonomy of the Synergini must be flawed \u2013 either because the characters used\ndo not adequately define taxa, or because the taxonomists identifying the specimens made535\nmistakes in character recognition. The authors have considerable accumulated experience of\nworking with inquiline cynipids (Nieves-Aldrey & Pujade-Villar, 1985, 1986; Pujade-Villar\n& Nieves-Aldrey 1990; Pujade-Villar 1992; Pujade-Villar et al., 2003; Sadeghi et al., 2006),\nso mistaken interpretation of specimen morphology should be rare. While it is possible that\noccasional placements of specimens in phylogenetically disparate MOTUs could be the result540\nof identification error (e.g. the placement of Synergus flavipes Figs. 3-5), we regard\ntaxonomist error as an unlikely explanation for two major persistent mismatches between\n22\nmorphological and sequence-based groupings: (i) The inability of sequence data to\ndiscriminate between Synergus gallaepomiformis, S. pallicornis, S. pallidipennis  and S.\npallipes; and (ii) the widespread phylogenetic placement and the multiple MOTU allocation545\nof specimens in the morphospecies Synergus hayneanus and S. umbraculus (Figs. 3-5, S1).\n4.3.1 Failure of barcodes to discriminate among recognised morphological species\nSeveral sets of Synergus species shared identical or very similar coxI, cytb and 28S D2\nsequences (Figs. 3-5, S1). Examples include Synergus gallaepomiformis, S. pallicornis, S.550\npallidipennis and S. pallipes combined in coxI MOTU 20,  Synergus acsi, S. flavipes and S.\nvariabilis combined in coxI MOTU 24, and Synergus hayneanus and S. umbraculus (Fig. S1).\nFailure to discriminate these species using sequence barcodes implies either (i) that these\nmorphospecies genuinely grade into each other (such that neither existing morphological\ncharacters nor barcode sequence can meaningfully discriminate among them) or (ii) that the555\nmorphological traits discriminating the species are real, but that the species have diverged so\nrecently that sorting of both mitochondrial (coxI) and nuclear (28S D2) lineages between\nthem is far from complete (Johnson & Cicero 2002; Funk & Omland, 2003; Meyer & Paulay,\n2005; Hickerson et al., 2006). We suspect that the first explanation applies. Synergus species\nare known to show substantial phenotypic variation within and between generations each year560\n(Wiebes-Rijks, 1979; Pujade-Villar, 1992; Nieves-Aldrey, 1986), and the characters currently\nused to discriminate species may simply represent redescriptions of phenotypic plasticity in a\nsingle taxon. We recommend that the morphological basis of the groups of species above\nshould be thoroughly reviewed. If reanalysis supports their maintenance as separate taxa, then\nspecies relationships should be reinvestigated using multiple nuclear locus approaches that565\nprovide greater statistical power when lineage sorting is likely to be incomplete (Jenning and\nEdwards 2005; Knowles & Carstens, 2007; Starrett & Hedin, 2007).\n23\n4.3.2 Placement of morphological species in phylogenetically diverse MOTUs.\nSynergus hayneanus and S. umbraculus are both placed in several phylogenetically570\ndivergent lineages for both mitochondrial and nuclear genes (Figs. 3-5, S1). This pattern was\nreconfirmed when the morphology of a subset of specimens of both species was rechecked\nwithout knowledge of their phylogenetic placement. Our results suggest the need for careful\nrevision of the morphological traits associated with separation of S. hayneanus and S.\numbraculus (and S. reinhardi, which was often hard to separate morphologically from S.575\nhayneanus). Further, the characters used to identify S. hayneanus and S. umbraculus are either\nhomoplasious or conserved ancestral traits, and conceal phylogenetically divergent but\nmorphologically cryptic lineages. While such cryptic lineages have been observed in other\narthropod groups (e.g. Hebert et al., 2004; Smith et al., 2006, 2007; Starrett & Hedin, 2007),\nthe Synergus complex is unusual in that its member species have a long history of taxonomic580\nand ecological study (Ross, 1951; Eady, 1952; Wiebes-Rijks, 1979; Nieves-Aldrey & Pujade-\nVillar, 1985, 1986; Pujade-Villar & Nieves-Aldrey 1990; Pujade-Villar 1992; Ronquist 1994;\nSch\u00f6nrogge et al., 1995, 1996a, 1996b; Liljeblad & Ronquist, 1998; Sch\u00f6nrogge & Crawley\n2000; Pujade-Villar et al., 2003).\n585\n4.4 Consequences of the need to revise oak inquiline gallwasp taxonomy\nA striking feature of the original Synergus sections established by Mayr (1872) is the\ncorrelation between section membership and biological differences. Most section I Synergus\nspecies are univoltine, and where there are two generations per year (in S. crassicornis and S.\numbraculus in the Iberian Peninsula), adult morphology does not differ markedly between590\ngenerations (Nieves-Aldrey & Pujade-Villar, 1985; Pujade-Villar, 1992). In contrast, most\nsection II Synergus species are bivoltine and show generational adult dimorphism (Ross,\n1951; Eady, 1952; Wiebes-Rijks, 1979; Nieves-Aldrey & Pujade-Villar, 1986; Pujade-Villar,\n1992). The distribution of section membership through the Synergus tree (Figs. 3-5, S1)\n24\nimplies that these character state combinations have evolved repeatedly in the genus. It is then595\nof interest to examine how strictly correlated evolution of these traits has been through\ndiversification of Synergus. However, such an analysis may be impossible using existing\npublished data, because for several Linnean species specimens attributed to a single\nmorphological species are placed in multiple distinct phylogenetic lineages (discussed in 4.3\nbelow). Unless DNA sequence data can be generated for the specimens examined in past600\nwork, it will be impossible to know which of alternative possible lineages should receive the\ncharacter states attributed to current Linnean species (see also Knowlton and Jackson, 1994).\nRevealing patterns of character state evolution in Synergus requires collection of new host\nassociation and life history data explicitly linked to accessions from which DNA sequence\ndata can be generated and lineage membership determined.605\nAcknowledgements\n610\nThis work was funded by grants from the U.K. NERC to GNS and KS (NE\/E014453\/1,\nNE\/D007178\/1, NER\/B\/504406\/1, NER\/B\/S2003\/00856, GR\/12847, GST032035), by a\nHungarian OTKA grant T049183 and a Bolyai Scholarship ZP, and by a British\u2013Hungarian\nIntergovernmental collaborative research grant (2002\u201304) to GNS and GM.\n615\nReferences\nAbe, Y., Melika, G., Stone, G.N., 2007.

Ln Bayes Factors are calculated as twice the\ndifference in lnHML (2\u0394lnHML) between alternative models, calculated from 2 runs for each\nmodel in MrBayes. For each single gene dataset, BF tests strongly supported a strict clock model,\nwhich is used as the reference for comparison with models in which taxon monophyly was\nenforced. Our inference follows Kass and Raftery (1995), with ln BF of 2-6, 6-10 and >10 taken to\nrepresent respectively positive, strong and very strong support for the model with higher likelihood.\nFor all three loci we used a GTR+I+G model, partitioned by codon position in cox1 and cytb.\nModel cox1 cox1\ninference\ncytb cytb\ninference\n28S D2 28S D2 inference\nHML for strict\nclock GTR+I+G\n-7039.8 -5875.5 -2242.2\nSynergus\nmonophyly\n20.9 Very\nstrongly\nsupported\n-2.8 Very\nweakly\nrejected\n-5.4 Weakly rejected,\nbut monophyletic\nwith a posterior\nprobability >0.95 in\nthe MrBayes\nconsensus tree.\nSynergus section 1\nmonophyly\n-959.3 Rejected -1457.5 Rejected -273.9 Rejected\nSynergus section 2\nmonophyly\n-961.5 Rejected -1454.7 Rejected -260.2 Rejected\nSaphonecrus\nmonophyly\n-19.3 Rejected 6.5\nStrongly\nsupported\n-63.5 Rejected\nSynergus\nhayneanus\nmonophyly\n-267.1 Rejected -753.8 Rejected -245.3 Rejected\nSynergus pallipes\nmonophyly\n-229.0 Rejected -438.6 Rejected -153.4 Rejected\nSynergus\numbraculus\nmonophyly\n-617.1 Rejected -1343.6 Rejected -242.0 Rejected\n1Table 2. coxI MOTUs identified from the maxdata and maxtaxa alignments containing specimens\nof more than one morphological species.
