As a result of the move away from vertical integration, as firms\noutsource those activities which they do not consider to be core competencies, a new\nnetwork-based business model has emerged.\nA network is a series of \u2018nodes\u2019 connected by \u2018links\u2019. In the case of a business\nnetwork the nodes comprise the sources of particular capabilities or resources and\nthe links are the interfaces that enable those capabilities or resources to be applied\nto create value in the marketplace.\nThe transition from the vertically integrated firm to a network of inter-connected\norganisations is highlighted by the example of the Ford Motor Company. When\nHenry Ford I established what was to become one of the world\u2019s largest automobile\ncompanies, the dominant logic was clearly that the means to the achievement of his\nbusiness objectives was through the ownership of all the knowledge capabilities and\nresources necessary for the efficient manufacture of the Model T Ford. The extent of\nHenry Ford\u2019s control of his supply chain included steel mills, rubber plantations and\nmahogany forests a well as component manufacturing capabilities. Today\u2019s Ford\nIndustrial Marketing Management, Vol 38, Iss 2, Feb 2009, pp 191-197\n4\nMotor Co. looks dramatically different. Most of the businesses involved in component\nmanufacturing were long ago floated off as an independent business, Visteon. The\nsteel mills have gone along with the plantations and forests. Hence Ford is now\nmuch more dependent for its continued survival on its network of suppliers and\ndistributors.\nThis picture has been replicated in industry after industry. Few companies today\nseek to create vertically integrated supply chains. Instead the focus is on how best\nto create virtual networks which are connected, not through ownership, but through\nshared information and knowledge.\nKnowledge sharing and inter-organisational trust\nThe idea that knowledge can be gained through a closer relationship with\nstakeholders across a network (e.g customers, suppliers, employees) is now fairly\nwidely accepted (Bessant et.al., 2003). However, simply being a member of a\nnetwork, as every organization is, does not automatically imply that knowledge will\nflow freely into a business. The way that knowledge flows across organisations is\nthrough interactions that are facilitated by trust (Sepp\u00e4nen et.al., 2007). Trust is\nbased upon a number of factors - one of which is reputation (Plank et.al., 1998).\nThe reputation that a business has can significantly impact its ability to forge strong\nknowledge generating and sharing relationships (Arino, de la Torre & Ring, 2001).\nThere is now a widely held view, particularly amongst authors who have focused on\nknowledge sharing in interrelationships adopting a social network perspective (Tsai &\nGhoshal 1998; Hansen 2002, Reagans & McEvily 2003), that knowledge exchange\nfacilitates improved performance within the network (Grant 1996). Organizations can\nlearn from each other and benefit from new knowledge developed by other\nIndustrial Marketing Management, Vol 38, Iss 2, Feb 2009, pp 191-197\n5\norganizations. Intraorganizational knowledge sharing seems to be associated with\nincreased cross-functional coordination in a network context like a supply chain.\nByrne (1993) defines a network-based virtual business as follows:\n\u201cA virtual corporation is a temporary network of independent companies \u2013\nsuppliers, customers and even rivals \u2013 linked by information technology to\nshare skills, costs and access to one another\u2019s markets. This corporate model\nis fluid and flexible \u2013 a group of collaborators that quickly unite to exploit a\nspecific opportunity. Once the opportunity is met, the venture will, more\noften than not, disband. In the concept\u2019s purest form, each company that\nlinks up with others to create a virtual corporation contributes only what it\nregards as its core competencies.\u201d\nIt has been suggested (Bovet & Martha 2000; Parolini 1999) that an appropriate\ndescriptor for these strategic networks could be \u2018value nets\u2019. This idea reflects the\nway in which value for customers \u2013 as well as for members of the network \u2013 is\ncreated through the exploitation of the combined knowledge, capabilities and\nresources of the network. Perhaps one of the best examples of such a value net is\nprovided by Cisco, a major provider of equipment for communication networks.\nCisco is a company, not yet twenty five years old, that has grown into an industry\nleader through its ability to leverage a virtual network. The vast majority of the\nproducts that Cisco sells are not touched by Cisco. A global web of contract\nmanufacturers and logistics service providers enable customised solutions to be\ncreated and delivered to Cisco customers. The key in-house capabilities are\ntechnology development and network orchestration, the latter made possible by\nhighly sophisticated, web-based information systems.\nThe trend to global sourcing and off-shore manufacturing has been one of the most\ndramatic phenomena of recent years. Recent research by the Cranfield Centre for\nLogistics and Supply Chain Management (Christopher et.al. 2007) has highlighted\nIndustrial Marketing Management, Vol 38, Iss 2, Feb 2009, pp 191-197\n6\nthat the primary motivation for these out-sourcing and off-shoring decisions has\nbeen cost. However, the research revealed that typically most companies take a\nvery narrow view of cost. The main focus seemed to be on the actual purchase cost\nor manufacturing cost plus transport and customs duties. Rarely did those sourcing\ndecisions take account of the additional inventory financing cost, the cost of lost\nsales and\/or obsolescence as a result of longer lead-times or the risks of supply\nchain disruption. Even more crucially it seems that the strategic impact of the\nchanged shape of the value web on the firm\u2019s competitive position did not enter the\nequation.\nRisky conditions and situations create a need for trust and reputation helps in\nmanaging these relationships. Clearly the dependencies created by out-sourcing are\nsignificant and the global dimension adds further complexity to the supply network.\nFor example, taking such opportunities to drive down the sourcing costs implies a\nneed to understand the changed risk profile and thus a strengthened evaluation of\nsuppliers is needed. Because of these dependencies there is an increased danger\nthat the reputation of the focal firm can be seriously impacted by the actions of other\nnetwork members.\nReputational Risk is Network-Wide\nIt can be agreed that organisations with strong reputations are better able to attract\nstakeholders and to develop more stable relationships with them. Any inter-\norganizational collaboration effort is also based on reputation and trust (Arino, de la\nTorre & Ring, 2001), which encourages information sharing and inter-partner\nlearning (Luo 2002; Griffin 2002; Rayner 2003; Neef 2003; Connell & Voola 2007).\nIndustrial Marketing Management, Vol 38, Iss 2, Feb 2009, pp 191-197\n7\nThe potential benefits are wide and affect many domains. There is a positive\nrelationship between trust among persons and knowledge sharing within and across\norganizations (Gupta & Govindarajan 2000). There is also a positive relationship\nbetween organisations\u2019 reputation and knowledge sharing within the network.\nOrganisations are nowadays extremely exposed to many different threats which can\ndamage their reputation and hence the need to manage this vulnerability.\nReputational risk is defined as failure to meet stakeholders\u2019 reasonable expectations\nof an organisation\u2019s performance and behaviour (Atkins, Bates & Drennan, 2006;\nTaewon & Amine 2007). However, guidelines or directions about the management of\nreputational risk tend not to be included in most current risk management standards,\ne.g. the standard and guidelines of IFRIMA (The International Federation of Risk and\nInsurance Management Associations), FERMA (Federation of European Risk\nManagement Associations), ISO (International Standard Organisation) and also the\nframeworks about Enterprise Risk Management (COSO 2004; IFRIMA 2004).\nParadoxically, many organisations have highlighted reputational risk as one of the\nmost critical threats for their business: relatively recent research by The Economist,\nwith the sponsorship of ACE, IBM and KPMG, surveyed in 2007 218 executives\naround the world about their approach to risk management, indicating that the need\nto protect and enhance reputation has been perceived as the key objective and\nbenefit of risk management, thus reputational risk is receiving substantial attention.\nIt has been cited as one of the most critical threats to the competitive standing and\nalso as the most difficult risk of all to manage. (Economist Intelligence Unit 2007).\nRisk to the reputation of a business has always been a concern of management. In\nthe past that risk would have been considered to be largely internal. However,\ntoday, as a result of outsourcing and the creation of the \u2018extended enterprise\u2019,\nreputation risk is as likely to come from external sources. The recent problems faced\nIndustrial Marketing Management, Vol 38, Iss 2, Feb 2009, pp 191-197\n8\nby Mattel who were forced to recall millions of toys as a result of quality problems at\noutsourced suppliers provides a current example of such risk and its consequences.\nOver several months in 2007 Mattel, the world\u2019s biggest toymaker recalled 21 million\ntoys made in China where two-thirds of its toys are manufactured. He causes of the\nrecalls were due firstly to some products being found to have excessive lead in their\npaint and secondly to the presence of small magnets in some toys which, if\nswallowed, were potentially lethal. Sales were hit as shipments were disrupted and\nconsumer confidence was eroded \u2013 sales in the US fell by 19% in a single quarter.\nMattel were forced to make a charge of $40m against the likely costs of the recall\nand an estimated $50m of lost sales further compounded their problems. One\nsupplier in China, Lida Plastic Toys Co. Ltd, was forced to close its operations and the\nowner committed suicide.\nWhilst who was ultimately responsible for these problems is an interesting question,\nthe undeniable effect of a failure to manage the interfaces in the supply chain has\nhad significant financial consequences for the network as a whole \u2013 not just Mattel.\nBecause reputation and brand image are ideas that are very closely linked, it is vital\nthat marketing should extend its remit to include the management of reputation and\nreputational risks. Since we have argued that reputation can be significantly affected\nby the actions of network stakeholders it follows that those stakeholders should be\ndrawn into the relationship management process. Whereas in the past the brand\nmay have been the product, or even the organisation, increasingly the network will\nbe the brand.\nAs Charles Fombrun (Director of the Reputation Institute) highlighted, (Fombrun\n2007) reputation includes the organisation\u2019s image but is something bigger. Image\ncould be defined as the beliefs which people have about an organisation, its products\nand services (Bernstein 1984; Hatch & Schultz 1997; Dowling 2004). For these\nreasons organisations are dedicating efforts and resources to influence the positive\nIndustrial Marketing Management, Vol 38, Iss 2, Feb 2009, pp 191-197\n9\nperception of their brand and corporate image. They invest more than in the past in\npromoting their integrity, their mission towards best products and services,\nhighlighting their \u2018fair\u2019 strategies and social orientation.\nLooking at the most reputable companies - the Reputation Institute in USA in 2007\nidentified Barilla, followed by Lego, Lufthansa, Ikea, Michelin and Toyota - they seem\nto be able to brand themselves rather then the products or their brand portfolio\n(King 1991; Berry 2000; Aacker & Joachimsthaler 2000).\nTrust and reputation within a network are strongly related to employee commitment.\nEmployees should be motivated to share goals, tasks, vision and knowledge across\nthe organisation and within the network (Milne 2007). Employees\u2019 interest and\nmotivation lead to better performance and they play an essential role in fostering the\norganisation\u2019s reputation in the perception of other B2B companies (Stuart 2002).\nEmployees\u2019 affiliation could lead the external partners to activate positive referrals,\npromoting the company\u2019s image by further helping the partners\u2019 recruitment (Scott &\nLane 2000).\nSimilarly, relationships with profitable customers should be maintained in order to\nincrease the success of services and products, to strengthen collaborative\neffectiveness and trust, and hence to improve outcomes in the long run. It also\nrequires an effective customer knowledge management system (Alajoutsij\u00e4rvi, Klint\n& Tikkanen 2001; Liu, Zang & Hu 2005).\nLooking particularly at B2B relationships, the effects of trust and reputation in B2B\nrelationships can be analysed from different perspectives, such as the emotional\ndimension (Gummesson 1996; Cova & Salle 2000), relationship marketing (Morgan\net al., 1994; Bruner & Spekman 1998) and buyer-seller relationships (Balmer 2003;\nAndersen & Kumar 2006; Enke & Greschuncha 2007).\nThe creation of a \u2018good\u2019 reputation in B2B relationships is an important step in\nachieving effective knowledge transfer mechanisms among supply chain partners and\nIndustrial Marketing Management, Vol 38, Iss 2, Feb 2009, pp 191-197\n10\nalso the integration of processes across the supply chain and hence to managing\nmore effectively the interfaces with supply chain partners.\nOrganisations which are able to build their reputation with partners (investing in\ntheir core competences and closer relationships) can better adapt to changing\nenvironments and market conditions and retain their customers and increase their\nsuccess. Other authors highlighted also how trust and reputation are likely to\npromote flexibility and adaptability within the B2B relationships, reducing the\nnegative effects of the information asymmetries (Arino, de la Torre & Ring, 2001).\nThese benefits are transversal and affect many domains: from a knowledge\nperspective, a greater use of knowledge sharing mechanisms among supply chain\npartners encourages cross-functional coordination and leads to better learning\nresults, and in turn, knowledge creation (Eng 2006). From a managerial perspective\ntrust and reputation leads to more effective selection of partners, pricing concessions\nby suppliers, reduced risk for investors, increased strategic flexibility, better\nperceived quality of the products and, not least, enhanced financial performance and\nimproved employee morale (Pellegrini 2004; Cretua & Brodie 2007).\nTrust and reputation move through three phases in B2B relationships : the pre-\nrelationship phase, the lifetime of the relationships and the termination and re-\nestablishment of relationships.\n1. In the \u201cpre-relationship phase\u201d they are a major determinant to start a\nbusiness relationship, to initiate relationship, to evaluate potential exchange\npartners, to start negotiations and collaboration (Heide 1994). The\ninformation cues or experiences from other parties play a great role. Barilla\nseveral years ago built a full assortment warehouse in order to integrate its\ndownstream logistics activities and to improve service performance for the\nretail customers. The aim of this project was to create an alliance with other\nprimary brands in the Italian food sectors in order to reduce their logistics\nIndustrial Marketing Management, Vol 38, Iss 2, Feb 2009, pp 191-197\n11\ncosts and make the services to the retailer more effective. The project was a\ngreat success and it was facilitated by the reputation of these companies who\nshared common goals and trust in the capability to reach the potential\nbenefits of this alliance\n2. During the lifetime of the relationships, the maturation of the relationships\nand also long-term relationships narrows the so-called \u2018knowledge gap\u2019 within\na network (Helander & M\u00f6ller 2007). Trust and reputation are a result of an\n\u201cexperiential learning\u201d (Witkowski & Thibodeau 1999), where meeting\nexpectations and making the balance between power and dependence,\ncooperation and competition, leads to stable linkages and finally affiliation\n(Andersen 2001). In vertical networks \u2013 for example in franchise networks -\nthe stable relationships between suppliers and shops are crucial. Calzedonia is\nan Italian franchise company which produces and sells beachwear and\nunderwear. The effective process of acquisition-design-assortment-opening of\nthe shops around the World represents a core competence which is internally\nmanaged. The timeliness and quality in opening and re-assorting new shops\nplays an important part in creating the company\u2019s profitability and helps in\nfostering the company image perceived by the customers and by the\nfranchisees. The relationships with suppliers are in this sense crucial. The\nnetwork of stable suppliers-partners can assure flexibility and knowledge of\nthe priorities in Calzedonia\u2019s business. They cope with short lead times, high\nquality requirements and contribute to the minimisation of warehouses and\nlogistics errors. Calzedonia focuses on partnership rather than low cost\nsourcing which helps in fostering and motivating the supplier\u2019s affiliation.\n3. In the termination and\/or re-establishment of relationships. Selex Sistemi\nIntegrati is a member of the Finmeccanica Group, a World leader in the\nprovision of integrated defense, air traffic and paramilitary mission critical\nIndustrial Marketing Management, Vol 38, Iss 2, Feb 2009, pp 191-197\n12\nsystems dealing with more than 400 projects. This company offers\ncomprehensive and advanced customer support solutions across the product\u2019s\nlife-cycle. To achieve this goal, Selex needed to establish stable relationships\nwith its suppliers during the total life of the projects. The termination of stable\nrelationships could compromise the stability of the projects and the\ncustomer\u2019s satisfaction. For these reasons Selex closely cooperates with\nsuppliers and external providers to ensure that when future projects arise\nthese organisations are willing to become partners in their extended\nenterprise.\nIn all of these 3 phases the communication of experiences from other parties are\noften essential in the creation of the \u201cexperiential learning\u201d. These are the referrals\nof external actors (existing customers, third parties, or B2B partners) or internal\nactors (employees), and are closely related to the reputation of the company.\nFigure 1 summarises some of the key literature and positions reputation in the wider\ncontext of stakeholders within a network.\nFigure 1: reputation in the wider context of stakeholders within a network\nB2B organisations which have trust in each other are more likely to promote each\nothers reputation and will exploit the opportunity to maximise referrals and\nstrengthen the trust that partners have in them. It also helps in the achievement of\nthe goals of attraction, satisfaction and retention, and in maintaining network\nstability through closing the positive circular cycle (See Figure 2).\nIndustrial Marketing Management, Vol 38, Iss 2, Feb 2009, pp 191-197\n13\nFigure 2: network stability: the positive circular cycle\nStrengthening Relationships through Knowledge and Reputation\nFollowing our analysis of the literature a number of propositions can be constructed\nwhich might lend themselves to further empirical research. The possible linkages\nbetween these propositions are shown in Figure 3.\nFigure 3: linkages between propositions\nP1: Networks have been defined as \u2018knowledge communities\u2019 (Connel & Voola 2007)\nwhere creating, capturing, and transferring knowledge-based sources with\ncustomers, employees and suppliers may facilitate concerted action, effective\nmanagement of relationships and improved performance. Information sharing (and\ntrust) may be positively related to the frequency of interaction or closeness of ties\n(Ghoshal, Korine & Szulanski 1994) revealing tie strength and the extent of long-\nterm relationships (Hansen 2002; Reagans & McEvily 2003).\nP2: Good relationships and an effective knowledge-based management of the\nlinkages with all of the key partners - both internal (employees) and external\n(customers and others) (Payne, Holt & Frow 2001) \u2013 affect reputation positively\n(Christopher, Payne & Ballantyne 1991; Gummesson 1995; Clark 1997; Dolmat-\nConnell 1999; Peck, Payne & Christopher 1999). Reputation has been defined as the\nintangible asset which expresses the evaluation of stakeholders as to whether the\nIndustrial Marketing Management, Vol 38, Iss 2, Feb 2009, pp 191-197\n14\nfirm is substantially \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019 (Weiss, Anderson & MacInnis 1999), and reflects\nthe cumulative knowledge about the past and present acts of the organisation\n(Taewon & Amine 2007).\nP3: Reputation is the esteem in which an organisation is held by stakeholders, it is\nan intangible but essential asset based on the organisation\u2019s actions. Reputation can\nlead to an \u201cemotional attachment\u201d (Keller 2003), a \u201cfavourability\u201d of the\nstakeholders towards the organisation (Taewon & Amine 2007), and also is a key to\ncreating more stable relationships with stakeholders (East 1997; Balmer & Gray\n1999; Roberts & Dowling 2002). Managing long-term relationships effectively\nrequires the capability to understand and to define specific goals for each group of\nstakeholders, since the organisation needs to achieve the goals of attraction,\nsatisfaction and retention of customers, employees and other stakeholders (see P4).\nP4: Cultivating a positive perception of the organisation\u2019s image and hence\nconsolidating the reputation increases the capability to attract \u2013 satisfy - retain\nstakeholders and increases the value of the intangible assets such as trust, the\nfranchise with customers and other partners, information sharing and brand equity,\ncreating a positive cause-and-effect circle. It helps in managing better these\nlinkages, leading to the achievement of better performance, knowledge and\nresponsiveness in the market (Calantone Cavusgil & Zhao 2002).\nP5: Das and Teng (2001) stated \u2018trust is a mirror image of risk\u2019. Reputational risk\ncan arise from any part of the organization or network relationships and can destroy\nthe organisation\u2019s credit overnight, while taking years to build up. Reputational\ndamage leads to stakeholders\u2019 erosion of trust, affecting relationships and even\nleading to the collapse of the enterprise (Atkins, Bates & Drennan 2006; Rayner\n2003).\nWhile reputation is widely accepted as being important, managing reputational risk\nsuccessfully is more challenging, and tends to be fragmented and unsystematic\nIndustrial Marketing Management, Vol 38, Iss 2, Feb 2009, pp 191-197\n15\n(Rayner 2003; Griffin 2002). It requires the right people in place to prevent and\nmanage reputational risk, and it is again a matter of organizational culture. No one\nperson in the organisation owns this risk, so a cross-functional management\napproach is required.\nTwo aspects are essential for assessing and managing reputational risk in order to\nreduce its negative effect on network relationships.\n1. Reputational risk may exist when the organisation\u2019s image perceived by\nthe stakeholders groups is not coherent with the organisation\u2019s proclaimed\nidentity.\nPharma, toys and clothing are examples of industries which often invest in promoting\ntheir image of social responsibility in order to improve their reputation and hence\ntheir competitive advantage. In these sectors, not keeping their promises represents\na potential crisis which can totally damage the brand reputation and destroy a\nsignificant part of the market \/ brand value, as in the previously quoted case of\nMattel. Another case was the U.S. company Guidant, a world leader in developing\ncardiac medicalsystems. In the three years 1999-2001 its innovative \u2018ancure\nendograft system\u2019, a sort of vascular pacemaker, caused serious problems to more\nthen 2600 patients and 12 died. Guidant did not recall the product, until some of\nGuidant\u2019s employees publicly revealed the problems. Guidant was found guilty and\npaid more then 92 million dollars and also lost its market position.\nClearly potential sources of risk across the network need a careful assessment,\nreputational risks need to be prevented before a crisis occurs but if a crisis happens\nneeds to be effectively managed.\n2. Reputational risk requires an effective management of the interfaces with\nthe stakeholders in the network.\nIndustrial Marketing Management, Vol 38, Iss 2, Feb 2009, pp 191-197\n16\nSeveral recent events demonstrate, as in the case of Guidant, how relationships with\nemployees and managers may represent a source of reputational risk. Some world\nfamous examples are the Enron scandals, the case of WalMart with the class action\nbrought by the female employees because of the alleged discrimination in\nremuneration, or the scandal of the extra salary provided to the CEO of Walt Disney\n(Valsania 2005). In some cases, employees can activate \u2018negative\u2019 referrals against\nthe business they operate in, as in the case of petroleum and chemical companies.\nEmployees have a range of expectations and complex sets of needs about \u2014 for\nexample \u2014 training, development, safe working environment. Misunderstanding\nemployees\u2019 needs represents a risk for the organization.\nIn the last 20 years employees gave evidence at the satefy and security risks caused\nby these industries, like in the case of Union Carbide in India (1984), Texas City in\nUSA (2005) and recently Thissen Group in Italy (2007). Media and those people\nknown as \u2019\u2019whistle blowers\u2019, who operate in customer organisations or have some\nvested interest in the business, may play a crucial role in revealing scandals,\nparticularly when the companies involved are well known for caring about\nenvironment and stakeholders. Recognising the potential impact of these people is a\nreputational risk identification issue.\nLike employees, customers have a range of expectations and needs about quality,\nprice, service, safety, transparency, ethics. Customers might often represent a\npotential source of negative (seldom positive) word-of-mouth, but organisations\nneed to be prepared to real cases of reputational threats coming from dissatisfied\ncustomers. This is the case of Intel\u2019s customer Thomas Nicely, a Professor of\nMathematics, who discovered in October 1994 that a micro-processor made an error\nin calculating the tenth decimal in some mathematical operations. When his\ncomplaints did not get any response from Intel, he exposed the case to many\nIndustrial Marketing Management, Vol 38, Iss 2, Feb 2009, pp 191-197\n17\ninternet newsgroups and websites. The information became so widespread that Intel\nhad to recall the micro-processor, with a loss estimated in 475 million dollars.\nThere is also the case of Dasani bottled water, launched in 2003 by Coca Cola in UK\nwith a strong advertising focus on the product\u2019s \u2018purity\u2019 (Atkins, Bates & Drennan\n2006). It transpired that Coca Cola sourced the water from the public mains supply\nin Sidcup, in the southeast London, filtering the water and introducing additives to\nimprove the taste. The water was found to contain minute traces of potentially\nharmful chemicals resulting in highly damaged publicity. Trust in the product\ndisappeared, and it was recalled at a cost of millions of pounds.\nThese examples highlight that reputational risk is closely related to the management\nof the interfaces with stakeholders, and particularly it seems essential:\n- to understand stakeholders\u2019 expectations and to define the company policy in\ncoherence with its vision and strategies;\n- to create a cross functional responsibility for reputation and reputational risk,\nstarting with the CEO and involving all levels of management;\n- to identity and evaluate internal and external causes of reputational risks\nwithin network relationships;\n- to mitigate reputational risk as a not-transferable risk to insurance, investing\nin prevention and in crisis management procedures to mitigate the negative\neffects.\nIn order to protect effectively network relationships and the threats to reputation,\nthere is a need to base effective corporate governance on the cross-functional\nmanagement of operations and human resources. The goal should be to achieve a\nnumber of outcomes:\n\uf0b7 a continuous assessment of the most significant sources of reputation risk\nfacing the organisation\nIndustrial Marketing Management, Vol 38, Iss 2, Feb 2009, pp 191-197\n18\n\uf0b7 knowledge of the possible effects on stakeholders perceptions and\nshareholders value of deviations to expected performance (Neef 2003)\n\uf0b7 ensuring appropriate levels of awareness of risk throughout the functions of\nthe organization\n\uf0b7 managing corporate communications to achieve coherence with the desired\nposition of the business.\nIn 1991 Barich and Kotler highlighted the strategic options for the CEO in the\nmanagement of reputation. Particularly in cases of poor reputation, the CEO needs\nto choose a \u2018performance-improving strategy\u2019, by investigating the negative\ncomponents of the company\u2019s reputation and improving the perception of\nstakeholders.\nLooking particularly at the network level - the supply chain - the effective\nmanagement of these options requires either a social intention of managing these\nrisks on a shared basis with partners, or the decision by the main actor to promote\nthe image of the network. But branding the network requires a coherent promotion\nof the real character of the relationships in the network.\nIndustrial Marketing Management, Vol 38, Iss 2, Feb 2009, pp 191-197\n19\nConclusion\nThis paper has focused on the essential role of managing the interfaces and\nknowledge sharing which connect the individual players in a global network. The\ntentative model we have proposed also highlights the potential impact of reputational\nrisk in influencing the perception of stakeholders about the organisation and the\nrelationships\u2019 stability.\nThe key literature and examples (summarised in Figure 1) position reputation and\nreputational risk in the wider context of relationships with all the stakeholders.\nTrust and reputation are also analysed, and related to the challenge of knowledge\nsharing in network relationships within a dynamic business environment.\nThe paper suggests five propositions in order to establish a framework whereby the\npositive correlations between reputation, capability to attract \u2013 satisfy - retain the\nstakeholders, information sharing and better performance can be identified. In this\nframework, with the support of some evidence from actual cases, reputational risk is\nshown as an emerging key factor that leads to a stakeholders\u2019 erosion of trust,\naffecting, relationships and even leading to the collapse of the enterprise.\nFinally, the paper suggests some essential aspects of understanding and managing\nreputational risk within a network. The company should be sensitive to stakeholders\u2019\nexpectations and needs to address key responsibilities to protect the organisation\u2019s\nimage, reputation and network relationships. It also requires an effective\ncommunication and information sharing within the organisation and along the\nnetwork.\nIndustrial Marketing Management, Vol 38, Iss 2, Feb 2009, pp 191-197\n20\nIt is possible to argue that the effective management of the network relationships\nrequires a strategic shift from \u2018branding the product\u2019 to \u2018branding the organisation\u2019\nand maybe to \u2018branding the network\u2019.\nThis challenge requires both an effective management of value creation process with\nrespect to the stakeholders (relationship management) and an effective\nmanagement of the alignment between the organisation\u2019s personality (core\ncompetencies, internal relationships), its image (external manifestations driven by\nthe marketing communication) and its knowledge and communication with all the\nstakeholders (strategic management).\nLIST OF REFERENCES\n- Aacker, D.A., Joachimsthaler, E.
