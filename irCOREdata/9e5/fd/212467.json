We would like to point out two major contributing factors for this lack of\nrealism. First, markets are neither complete nor frictionless. A large body of literature has\nstudied asset pricing under incomplete markets as well as under various frictions, such as\nportfolio constraints. Much less work has been done when financial institutions are sub-\njected to risk-sensitive constraints. Risk sensitive regulation, where statistical risk models\nare used to determine allowable levels of risk and of bank capital, has recently become\nthe cornerstone of international financial regulations. Given the compulsory nature of the\nBasel-II prescriptions, asset prices, allocations and welfare will all be strongly affected by\nrisk sensitive regulation. As a result, standard frictionless asset pricing methodologies may\nno longer be appropriate.\nSecond, very few, if any, equilibrium models provide micro-foundations for the risk under-\nlying said risk-sensitive regulation. While some papers, for instance see Basak and Shapiro\n(2001)1 and Cuoco and Liu (2005), model asset pricing in a risk-regulated world, that\nworld is by assumption first-best and would therefore not warrant any regulation in the\nfirst place. The rationale for regulating risk must lie in the fear of what has been called a\nsystemic event. Empirically, such an event seems to be priced in the markets. For instance,\nthe implied distribution of post-\u201987 out-of-the money put options is substantially negatively\nskewed (consult Bates (2000), Pan (2002) and Carr and Wu (2003) who argue that this is\ndue to the fear of substantial negative return jumps). While modelling a systemic crash\nas an exogenous shock may be useful in practice, in the absence of any market failure it\nis nevertheless not clear why this would require regulation. It is also not clear what a\nsystemic event is in the first place (see De Bandt and Hartmann, 2000, for a survey). For\nconcreteness we provide a formal definition of a systemic event.\nOur task in this simple model with a continuum of agents (with varying coefficients of risk\naversion and heterogeneous in their regulatory status: while some are regulated others may\nnot be) is to formalize our intuition about systemic events that are due to an externality-\ninduced free-riding market failure. Investors face random asset endowments. Being indi-\nvidually negligible they disregard the effects of their actions on aggregate outcomes. As\na result in equilibrium an excessive fraction of total risk is concentrated on a small but\nsignificant number of highly leveraged investors, that is investors who borrow large sums by\nshorting the riskless asset and investing those sums in the risky assets. In turn, it suffices\nthat an unanticipated event transforms this imbalance between those agents who own the\n1Basak and Shapiro are foremost interested in modelling the optimal dynamic portfolio process of a\nregulated investor in complete Brownian markets and under various forms of constraints. They find for\ninstance that in the worst states, regulated investors may take on more risk than non-regulated investors\nand consequently increase the stock market volatility in an economy with two log-utility agents, one of\nwhich is regulated. We find a similar result driven by agent heterogeneity.\n2\nshares and those agents who have spare investable capital into a systemic crisis.\nMore concretely, we model assets as rights to the output stream of firms, as in (a static\nversion of) Lucas (1978). Following Holmstrom and Tirole (1998), we introduce an in-\ntermediate date at which firms may face a sudden (perfectly correlated across firms, i.e.\naggregate) liquidity need. In order to keep the production process going, the existing share-\nholders are asked to provide liquidity to the firms by lending them an amount of riskless\nassets proportional to their shares in the firms. This sudden demand for additional working\ncapital conveys no information as to the worth of the firm. We can view this stage either\nas pre-bankruptcy deliberations or as a stylized rights issue. The liquidity is reimbursed\nto them at date 1 with interest, provided that the productive sector was able to raise\nsufficient liquidity. Refinancing may fail since the holders of large equity positions may\nnot themselves have the required incentives to accumulate enough liquidity to lend to the\nfirms. In this paper the frictions consist of the assumptions that a) the productive sector\nmust be refinanced as a whole (the outputs of the various firms are also inputs into each\nother, say), and b) that markets are closed at the intermediate date. This assumption\nis both theoretically and empirically reasonable. The initial investors, much like venture\ncapitalists, gather private information about the projects they are investing in, or are at\nleast perceived as doing so. This asymmetry might make fire-selling the project and\/or\nattracting short-term liquidity from third parties impossible. The probability of a systemic\ncrash increases along with imbalances in agents\u2019 leverage and risk taking. We measure\nsystemic risk by the degree of imbalance of risk taking and leverage among agents.\nSystemic risk therefore arises due to externalities and does warrant regulation. How suc-\ncessful are risk-sensitive regulations of the VaR type? Our model demonstrates that regu-\nlatory risk constraints lower the risk of a systemic event in equilibrium by preventing some\nregulated investors from accumulating excessively levered risky positions. Even though in\nequilibrium this means that more risk is held by risk-tolerant unregulated investors, equi-\nlibrium prices adjust in a way as to guarantee that even the unregulated investors, while\nholding more risk, also hold commensurately more of the safe asset.\nBut risk-sensitive regulations do impose social costs as well. First, risk-sensitive regulations\nmay prevent market clearing in some circumstances if all financial institutions are regulated.\nThe probability of markets not clearing increases with the tightness of the risk constraint.\nThe basic intuition is that in periods of stress, such as with large fire-sales, the risk that\nwould have to be taken on by the buyers could violate all potential buyers\u2019 regulatory\nconstraints. Since non-diversifiable aggregate risk needs to be held at an equilibrium,\nno equilibrium can exist. No matter how cheap the risky assets are, regulated financial\ninstitutions face binding risk constraints and cannot buy more risky assets at any price.\nWe show that there is a set of states for which there is no market clearing equilibrium. We\nalso exhibit a set of states where equilibria exist but where prices and real allocations are\nindeterminate (nominal and real indeterminacy).\n3\nSecond, the feedback-effects of regulation on the behaviour of prices are also important in\nand by themselves. We demonstrate that the equilibrium pricing function in a regulated\neconomy exhibits, as regulation becomes tighter, less depth and more volatility (the covari-\nance matrix is more positive definite, meaning that any portfolio of assets is more volatile).\nThe fundamental intuition behind these results rests in the endogenous equilibrium level\nof risk-aversion in the market as a result of agent heterogeneity. The regulatory constraint\ncauses the pricing function to become more concave for typical trades, since risk will have\nto be transferred from the more risk-tolerant to the more risk-averse. In order for the more\nrisk-averse to take on the additional risk, the discount will have to be bigger the more\nrisk-averse the marginal buyers are. Hence for a given change in demand, prices move\nmore with regulation than without, implying higher (local) volatility and lower liquidity\npost regulation.\nA well known source of major financial losses is the fact that correlations or comovements\nof assets are amplified in times of stress. While margin calls and wealth effects have been\namong the proposed explanations, as in Kyle and Xiong (2001), we are not aware of any\nmodels that are able to generate increased comovements in periods of stress from the reg-\nulatory constraints. Our model suggests that one of the explanations for the observed\nstate-dependent comovement may be the impact of risk constraints on portfolio optimiza-\ntion, especially in times of stress. Even in the absence of wealth effects and even if assets\nhave independent payoffs and independent demand innovations, sufficiently strict regula-\ntions will cause some agents to adjust their risk position by scaling down their holdings in\nthe risky assets, thereby introducing comovements. This effect will be most pronounced\nduring financial crises. As a result, a Basel style regulation introduces the potential for an\nendogenous increase in correlation, thereby decreasing the agents ability to diversify and in-\ncreasing the severity of financial crises. Financial institutions therefore require equilibrium\nrisk premia that are higher than predicted by frictionless models.\n2 The Model\nOur economy is based upon a standard two-dates constant absolute risk\u2013aversion model\nwithout asymmetric information and with a stochastic asset supply. There are two families\nof agents: regulated financial institutions (RFI) that are subjected to regulatory risk con-\nstraints (e.g. banks) and unregulated institutions (UFI) (e.g. hedge funds). The standard\ntwo-dates model is extended by adding an intermediate date, date one, to it. At date\nzero the UFIs and RFIs invest their (random) endowments in both risky and \u201criskless\u201d\n(a zero-coupon bond) assets. Consumption occurs at date two. We follow common mod-\nelling practice by endowing financial institutions with their own utility functions (such as\nin Basak and Shapiro, 2001). At the intermediate date one, as further explained below, a\nrefinancing need may arise, which we refer to as a liquidity event.\n4\nThere are N nonredundant risky assets that promise, in the absence of any liquidity event,\nnormally distributed payoffs d \u223c N\n(\n\u00b5\u02c6, \u03a3\u02c6\n)\nat date two, independent of the random en-\ndowments of assets.2 The hats indicate payoffs, returns (. . . , di\/qi, . . . ) are distributed as\nN(\u00b5,\u03a3). Asset 0 is the \u201criskless asset\u201d and promises to pay off the deterministic amount\nd0, except in a systemic event, defined as a liquidity event at which refinancing fails due\nto the actions taken by investors, when the payoff is zero. Asset payoffs and returns are\naccordingly conditionally, but not unconditionally, normally distributed. The event tree\nmay be represented schematically as:\nInsert figure 1 here\nEach FI is characterized by its type h, which determines risk-aversion and endowments,\nand by its regulation status t, which is either t = {r} if the FI is regulated, or t = {u} if\nit is unregulated. Each type of financial institution h \u2208 [\u2113, \u2113] is characterized by a constant\ncoefficient of absolute risk aversion (CARA) \u03b1h as well as an initial endowment of the\nriskless asset \u03b8h0 and of the risky assets \u03b8\u02dc\nh\n:= \u03b8h \u2212 \u01ebh, where \u01ebh represents the random\ncomponent of the endowments in the risky assets, with \u01eb :=\n\u222b \u2113\n\u2113\n\u01ebhdh. For simplicity, we\nassume that \u01ebh = \u01eb\n\u2113\u2212\u2113\n, that \u03b1h = h (but for clarity we still label agent h\u2019s coefficient by\n\u03b1h rather than by h only) and that all institutions are risk-averse, \u2113 > 0. A fraction \u03b7(h)\nof agents of each type h are regulated, the remaining fraction is unregulated. We impose\nno restrictions on \u03b7, and none of the propositions in the paper depend qualitatively on\n\u03b7, provided that a non-null subset of agents are regulated. A FI (h, t) invests its initial\nwealth W h0 in a portfolio comprising both riskless and risky assets, (y\nh,t\n0 ,y\nh,t). The time\u2013\nzero wealth of an agent of type h (regulated or unregulated) comprises initial endowments\nin the riskless asset, \u03b8h0 , as well in risky assets, \u03b8\u02dc\nh\n, so that W h0 \u2261 q0\u03b8h0 + q\u2032\u03b8\u02dc\nh\n. The price\nvector of risky assets is denoted by q. Since the time-zero budget constraint q0\u03b8\nh\n0 + q\n\u2032\u03b8\u02dc\nh \u2265\nq0y\nh,t\n0 + q\n\u2032yh,t is homogeneous of degree zero in prices, we can normalize, without loss of\ngenerality, the price of the riskless asset to q0 \u2261 1, i.e. the riskless asset is used as the\ntime\u2013zero nume\u00b4raire. We can write Rf := d0\/q0 = d0 for the return on the riskless asset in\nthe absence of a systemic event. At date 2, the consumption commodity plays the role of\nthe nume\u00b4raire.\n2Independence simplifies our analysis. If supply shocks were not independent of payoffs, then asset\nprices would convey payoff-relevant information. The information extraction problem is easy to solve for\nsome parametric distributions, such as the normal distribution, but contributes little to the issues at hand\nand does require additional parametric assumptions. Normality of payoffs may be at odds with option-like\nderivative securities and should be viewed as an approximation over shorter periods in the presence of such\noption-like derivatives. In any Brownian model, returns on derivatives are normal over short horizons.\n5\nThe aggregate amount of outstanding risky assets owned by investors is \u03b8\u02dc\na\n:=\n\u222b \u2113\n\u2113\n\u03b8\u02dc\nh\ndh.\nThe random component \u01eb is assumed to be distributed on E \u2282 RN according to the law\nP\n\u01eb, for simplicity assumed to be independent of the law governing asset payoffs, Pd. In this\npaper, we do not impose any assumptions upon the distribution of \u01eb other than to assume\nthat its support E is open and convex, in order to occasionally apply differential calculus.\nInstead of interpreting \u01eb as noisy asset endowments, with the appropriate adjustments one\ncould interpret \u01eb as noise trader supplies. Because the total endowment of risky assets\nhas to be absorbed by the UFIs and RFIs in equilibrium, prices depend upon \u01eb. This is\nthe only role of stochastic asset endowments. In a dynamic version of our model where\ndividends or news about the value of firms govern the resolution of uncertainty, they can\nbe dropped entirely, as in Danielsson et al. (2004).\nThe aim of the regulations for risk-taking is to control extreme risk-taking by individual\nfinancial institutions. In theory, a large number of possible regulatory environments exist\nfor this purpose. In practice, we are not aware of any published research into the welfare\nproperties of alternative market risk regulatory methodologies,3 and as a result, we adopt\nthe standard market risk methodology, i.e., Value-at-Risk (VaR). The constraint takes the\nform:4\nP\n[\n(E[W h]\u2212W h) \u2265 V aR] \u2264 p\u00af,\ni.e. the probability of a loss larger than the uniform regulatory number V aR is no larger\nthan p\u00af. Each RFI maximizes the expected utility subject to both the budget constraint\nand the VaR constraint by choosing the optimal asset holdings. In the next section, we go\ninto the details of how the liquidity events play out.\n3Among those methodologies one could enumerate various schemes to explicitly limit risk-taking or\nleverage, lending-of-last-resort practices, regulation of the admissible financial contracting practices with\na view of overcoming agency or free-riding problems, and so forth. Of course, we know from Artzner et al.\n(1999) that VaR is not a desirable measure from a purely statistical point of view because it fails to be\nsubadditive. Furthermore, Ahn et al. (1999) show that the VaR measure may not be reliable because it\nis easy for a financial institution to legitimately manage reported VaR through options. Alexander and\nBaptista (2002) caution against using mean-VaR portfolio allocation as opposed to the standard mean-\nvariance analysis.\n4We follow standard practice (as advocated by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (1996)\nand by Jorion (2001) for instance) and use the relative VaR, i.e. the dollar loss relative to the mean (the\nunexpected loss), rather than the absolute VaR, i.e. the dollar loss relative to the initial value. Over\nshort horizons the two coincide, but over longer horizons the relative VaR has proved more useful as it\nappropriately accounts for the time value of money. Indeed, over large horizons, with many data-generating\nprocesses calibrated to past data, the absolute VaR number would be swamped by the drift term.\n6\n3 Modelling Systemic Crises\nWhile many authors attribute systemic fragility to an excessive piling-on of debt (e.g.\nKindleberger (1978), Feldstein (1991)), those theories have relied explicitly or implicitly on\nirrationality.5 In our model no such irrationality is required to generate excessive leverage,\nwhich arises solely by the fact that the less risk-averse FIs are not bearing the full social\ncosts of their actions. Shares are rights to the output stream of firms. Firms may face a\nsudden aggregate liquidity need (assumed to be independently distributed of payoffs and\ndemand innovations) which can only be satisfied by a further injection of capital (cash) from\nthe shareholders in proportion to the size of their existing share holdings. This liquidity\nis reimbursed to them at date 1 with interest Rf , provided that the productive sector as\na whole is able to raise sufficient liquidity. Since each investor believes he is too small to\naffect the aggregate allocation, and therefore whether the refinancing is successful or not,\nhe may have an incentive to disregard the social cost of his actions and accumulate an\nexcessively risky and leveraged position. What is an \u201cexcessive\u201d level for a FI is specified\nwithin the model, and depends on the actions of all other FIs.\nFormally, assume that a liquidity event L occurred, and that each shareholder is asked\nduring the emergency meetings with the firms\u2019 stakeholders to contribute to firm i Ki units\nof the riskless asset per unit of asset i held, with K := (. . . , Ki, . . . ). This is similar to the\nfixed costs assumption in Marshall (1998). While shareholders do not have to come to the\nrescue of the productive sector by contributing working capital, it is a weakly dominant\nstrategy to do so. The total amount of riskless assets lent by (h, t) to the productive sector\nis therefore the full amount K\u2032yh,t if h has the required liquidity, yh,t0 \u2265 K\u2032yh,t, otherwise\nyh,t0 only:\nLh,t := min{yh,t0 ,K\u2032yh,t}\nDefining Sh,t := K\u22a4yh,t \u2212 Lh,t, The financing shortfall stemming from investor (h, t) is:\nSh,t+ := max{0, Sh,t}\nAggregate shortfall S(\u01eb, v\u00af) is defined as\nS(\u01eb, v\u00af) :=\n\u222b \u2113\n\u2113\n[\u03b7(h)Sh,r+ + (1\u2212 \u03b7(h))Sh,u+ ]dh\n5Some authors have studied financial stability purely from a banking perspective. The bank-run lit-\nerature (e.g. Bryant (1980) and Diamond and Dybvig (1983), and subsequent work based thereon, e.g.\nGorton and Huang (2003)) exploits coordination problems between multiple equilibria, while the interbank\nliterature studies how shocks can be amplified through balance-sheet networks, such as Allen and Gale\n(2000) and Cifuentes et al. (2005). The sunspots features in some of the coordination models have been\nreplaced by a unique equilibrium in the recent literature based on the global games concept (e.g. Carlsson\nand Van Damme (1993) and Morris and Shin (1998)). Our model in contrast is market based rather than\nbanking based.\n7\nAggregate output collapses if refinancing fails, i.e. if the proceeds are too low, and each\ninvestor\u2019s consumption is at the survival level. The event \u201crefinancing fails\u201d is the event\nthat in aggregate S(\u01eb, v\u00af) > S\u00af for some S\u00af. Implicit in this definition is the idea that even\nif working capital can be reallocated across firms at date one, there just is not enough\nto sustain all firms\u2019 production plans. The event (viewed as a measurable subset of E)\nwhereby a latent refinancing imbalance S(\u01eb, v\u00af) > S\u00af exists at equilibrium is denoted by Fv\u00af.\nWhen no ambiguity arises, we simply denote it by F.\nThe assumption that output completely collapses is made for simplicity only and reflects\na strongly interdependent production sector. While none of our main results depend on a\nprecise micro foundation for such an interdependent sector, for the sake of concreteness we\noutline one such economy. Before nature chooses whether there will be a liquidity shock\nor not, each firm i is in the process of producing a heterogeneous intermediate output.\nWe say that the production sector is strongly interdependent if the intermediate input-\noutput matrix is symmetric, indecomposable and if every intermediate input of any firm\ni is crucial (meaning that the output of firm i is zero in case there is some intermediate\ninput in the input list Ii of firm i that is no longer supplied to i). Indecomposability is\na standing assumption in standard input-output analysis, see for instance Nikaido (1968).\nIndecomposability and cruciality are equivalent here to requiring that for any two firms\ni and j, there is a sequence of distinct firms {k1 = i, k2, . . . , kn\u22121, kn = j} such that a\nminimal amount of intermediate output by j is required as an intermediate input in the\nproduction of intermediate output kn\u22121, and a minimal amount of of intermediate output\nkn\u22121 in turn is required as an intermediate input in the production of kn\u22122 and so forth\nall the way up to i. Any two sectors are directly or indirectly linked in this way. If Ii is\nthe list of firms whose intermediate inputs are required in the production of intermediate\noutput i, then the output of intermediate output i is (here d = (. . . , di, . . . ) is the normally\ndistributed random payoff variable introduced above,\n\u220f\nis the product operator and 1event\nstands for the indicator function which equals 1 if the event is true and zero otherwise):\nintermediate outputi = e\ndi1{Qj\u2208Ii intermediate outputj>0}\nBefore the intermediate outputs can be shipped, nature determines whether a liquidity\nshock occurs or not. If the liquidity shock occurs and refinancing fails for at least some\nfirm j, then intermediate outputj = 0, and the intermediate outputs of all firms collapse.\nWe might interpret the aggregate nature of the liquidity shock as consisting of necessary\ninvestments into the transportation network for inputs between firms. A shortfall larger\nthan S\u00af represents the event whereby at least one link of the transportation network is\nno longer operational due to underinvestment. If refinancing succeeds, then intermediate\noutputi = e\ndi , all firms i. The intermediate output is then in a second production phase\ntransformed into the homogeneous consumable final output via the production function\nfinal outputi = ln(intermediate outputi)\n8\nIf some firm fails to refinance itself (or if some transportation link fails to receive adequate\ninvestments), then by strong interdependence all final outputs are \u2212\u221e and each investor\u2019s\nconsumption is normalized to be equal to some arbitrarily small survival amount xh,t =\nx > \u2212\u221e, all h, t \u2208 {u, r}.6 To summarize,\nL and F \u21d2 xh,t = x a.s., all h, t \u2208 {u, r}\nDefinition 1 (Systemic Crash, Normal Market Conditions) We define a systemic\ncrash (or a systemic event or collapse) as the event L \u2229 F. The ex-ante probability of a\nsystemic event is P(L \u2229 F) = P(L)P(F).\nNormal market conditions are defined as the event N := (L\u2229F)c which obtains with ex-ante\nprobability P(N) = 1\u2212 P(L \u2229 F).\nNotice that probabilities depend on v\u00af as well as on the chosen distribution of risk among\nthe agents.\n4 The Decision Problem of the Financial Institutions\nThe RFI\u2019s program consists in choosing demand schedules to solve the following program.\nProblem 1 (Risk-Constrained Program)\nmax\n{(yh,yh\n0\n)}\nP(L \u2229 F|\u01eb)uh(x) + (1\u2212 P(L \u2229 F|\u01eb))E[uh(xh)\u2016N, \u01eb]\nsubject to yh0 + q\n\u2032yh \u2264 \u03b8h0 + q\u2032\u03b8\u02dc\nh\nxh = W h := d\u2032yh +RfL\nh +Rf (y\nh\n0 \u2212 Lh) = d\u2032yh +Rfyh0\nP\n[\n(E[W h|\u01eb]\u2212W h) \u2265 V aR\u2016\u01eb] \u2264 p\u00af\nSince individual institutions are negligible, this formulation gives rise to the free-riding\nexternality mentioned above. Each financial institution chooses to neglect the effect of\ntheir actions on P(L\u2229F|\u01eb). Rationality on behalf of the investor requires that he correctly\nlearns from \u01ebh and q in equilibrium. Of course, since \u01ebh fully reveals \u01eb, q is uninformative\ngiven \u01ebh. The investor therefore knows whether a critical latent imbalance is built up or\nnot. What he does not know is whether a liquidity event obtains that would turn the\nknown latent imbalance into a systemic crisis.\n6As usual in the CARA-normal setting, the consumption set is unbounded below and equals R \u222a\n{\u2212\u221e,+\u221e}. The least desirable bundle \u2013\u201cthe collapse of the productive sector\u201d\u2013 is therefore effectively\n\u2212\u221e, and x is an arbitrary small number, i.e. negative with |x| arbitrarily large.\n9\nConsider the auxiliary program where it is known that a systemic crash is impossible.\nPayoffs and returns are then normally distributed, and a sufficient statistic for portfolio\nrisk is the volatility of W h. The VaR constraint can therefore be stated as an exogenous\nupper bound v\u00af on portfolio variance,7\nyh\n\u2032\n\u03a3\u02c6yh \u2264 v\u00af (1)\nThe auxiliary program can be written:\nmax\n{(yh,yh\n0\n)}\nE[uh(xh)|N, \u01eb]\nsubject to yh0 + q\n\u2032yh \u2264 \u03b8h0 + q\u2032\u03b8\u02dc\nh\nxh = W h \u2261 d\u2032yh +RfLh +Rf (yh0 \u2212 Lh) = d\u2032yh +Rfyh0\nyh\n\u2032\n\u03a3\u02c6yh \u2264 v\u00af\nSuppose that at the equilibrium with the original program the investor knows that there\nis no global imbalance, Fc. Then whether or not a liquidity event obtains, no systemic\ncrash can occur, and the solution to Program 1 coincides with the solution to the auxiliary\nprogram. Next assume that the investor knows that F obtains. Since neither P(L \u2229 F|\u01eb)\nnor uh(x) are affected by the actions of investor h, his objective function again coincides\nwith the one in the auxiliary program. The same is true for the VaR constraint:\nP\n[\n(E[W h|\u01eb]\u2212W h) \u2265 V aR\u2016\u01eb] = P(L) \u00b70+(1\u2212P(L))Pd [(Ed[W h|\u01eb]\u2212W h) \u2265 V aR\u2016\u01eb] \u2264 p\u00af\nThis is the main role played by the assumption that crisis consumption x is exogenous as\nit allows both two-fund separation and the given VaR constraint to hold even with the\npossibility of a non-null systemic event. The solution to Program 1 coincides with the\nsolution to the auxiliary program, with p\u00af replaced by p\u00af\n(1\u2212P(L))\n. In the analysis that follows\nwe simply write p\u00af with the understanding that it should be p\u00af\/(1\u2212 P(L)) in case investors\nknow there is a latent imbalance. The solution to the investor\u2019s problem is given by the\nfollowing lemma:\nLemma 1 (Optimal Portfolio) The optimal portfolio of risky assets for RFI (h, t) has\nthe mean-variance form\nyh,t =\n1\n\u03b1h + \u03c6h,t\n\u03a3\u02c6\n\u22121\n(\u00b5\u02c6\u2212 Rfq) (2)\n7Indeed, denoting the cumulative standard normal distribution function by N(\u00b7), the VaR constraint\ncan be reduced to a volatility constraint: Pd\n[\n(Ed[Wh|\u01eb]\u2212Wh) \u2265 V aR\u2016\u01eb] \u2264 p\u00af iff N ( \u2212V aR\nStdd(W h|\u01eb)\n)\n\u2264 p\u00af iff\nStdd(Wh\u2016\u01eb) \u2264 V aR\u2212N\u22121(p\u00af) iff Vard(Wh|\u01eb) \u2264 v\u00af :=\n(\nV aR\n\u2212N\u22121(p\u00af)\n)2\n.\n10\nwhere \u03c6h,u := 0 and \u03c6h,r := 2\u03bb\nh,r\nEd[uh\u2032(Wh)|\u01eb]\n\u2265 0, with \u03bbh,r being the Lagrange multiplier of\nthe VaR constraint. The effective degree of risk-aversion, \u03b1h + \u03c6h,r, is independent of the\ninitial wealth W h0 and only depends on \u03b1\nh, q and v\u00af.\nA binding risk-regulation affects the portfolio through the effective degree of risk-aversion,\n\u03b1h+\u03c6h,r. Whereas the coefficient of absolute risk-aversion is constant for unrestricted FIs,\nit is endogenous for the FIs subjected to the VaR regulations and is larger than their utility-\nbased coefficient during volatile events, \u03b1h+\u03c6h,r \u2265 \u03b1h. In volatile events RFIs shift wealth\nout of risky assets into the safe haven provided by the riskless asset. This is one way of\ncapturing the often-heard expression among practitioners that \u201crisk-aversion went up,\u201d or\nthat there is a \u201cflight to quality.\u201d This is reminiscent of the effect of portfolio insurance on\noptimal asset holdings found in Grossman and Zhou (1996). Also see Gennotte and Leland\n(1990) and Basak (1995). As a matter of convention, we reserve the term risk-aversion to\nthe CARA coefficients \u03b1h. We call \u03b1h + \u03c6h,r the coefficient of effective risk-aversion, and\nwe call its inverse risk appetite. From here it can be easily shown that the FIs with risk\naversions close to \u2113 are highly levered in that they borrow from the more risk averse and\ninvest that borrowed money in risky projects, thereby effectively acting as banks.\nMarket clearing prices require that the total excess demand by regulated and unregulated\ninstitutions,\n\u222b \u2113\n\u2113\n[\u03b7(h)yh,r+(1\u2212\u03b7(h))yh,u]dh\u2212 \u03b8\u02dca must equal zero. Equivalently they satisfy\nthe relation:\nq =\n1\nRf\n[\n\u00b5\u02c6\u2212\u03a8\u03a3\u02c6\u03b8\u02dca\n]\n(3)\nwhere\n\u03a8\u22121 :=\n\u222b \u2113\n\u2113\n[\n\u03b7(h)\n1\n\u03b1h + \u03c6h,r\n+ (1\u2212 \u03b7(h)) 1\n\u03b1h\n]\ndh (4)\nis the aggregate effective risk-tolerance. Prices are equal to risk-neutral prices minus a\nrisk adjustment. \u03a8 can also be viewed as the reward-to-variability ratio (or a market-\nprice of risk scalar) of the market \u03b8\u02dc\na\n, \u03a8 =\n\u00b5\u02c6M\u2212Rf qM\n\u03c3\u02c62\nM\n. Compared to an economy without\nany VaR constraints where the market-price of risk scalar is \u03b3 :=\n(\u222b \u2113\n\u2113\n1\n\u03b1h\ndh\n)\u22121\n, we have\n\u03a8 \u2265 \u03b3. But the market price of risk is not only higher in a constrained economy than\nin an unconstrained one, it also is endogenous and random through the additional risk\naversion \u03c6h imposed by the regulations.8 The sole pricing factor being the market portfolio\n8Equations (2, 3 and 4) remain valid if utility functions are not of the constant absolute risk-aversion\nclass. The only difference would be that \u03b1h = \u2212E\nd[uh\n\u2032\u2032\n]\nEd[uh\u2032]\n, and therefore endogenous. While no closed-form\nsolutions exist in this more general case, \u03a8 \u2265 \u03b3 would still hold and the rationale underlying our results\nwould survive with reasonable income effects. Since most results in the sequel are driven mainly by the\n11\n\u03b8\u02dc\na\n, it becomes apparent that assuming noise traders is equivalent to assuming a random\naggregate endowment in risky assets of \u03b8\u02dc\na\n.\n5 On Market Clearing\nOur definition of a rational expectations competitive equilibrium as a pricing function Q\nmapping noise trades \u01eb to market clearing prices is entirely standard (see Radner (1979)):\nDefinition 2 A competitive equilibrium is a pricing function Q together with its do-\nmain, Q : E\u00d7 R+ \u2192 RN , an asset allocation (h \u2208 [\u2113, \u2113], t \u2208 {r, u}, \u01eb \u2208 E) 7\u2192 (yh,t, yh,t0 )(\u01eb)\nand a consumption allocation (h \u2208 [\u2113, \u2113], t \u2208 {r, u}, \u01eb \u2208 E) 7\u2192 xh,t(\u01eb) such that\n(i) Given any (\u01eb, v\u00af) \u2208 E\u00d7R+ and q \u2208 Q(\u01eb, v\u00af), (yh,t, yh,t0 , xh,t) solve FI (h, t)\u2019s optimization\nproblem, and this is true for all FIs (h, t) \u2208 [\u2113, \u2113]\u00d7 {r, u}.\n(ii) Markets for risky assets clear,\n\u222b \u2113\n\u2113\n[\n\u03b7(h)yh,r + (1\u2212 \u03b7(h))yh,u] dh = \u03b8\u02dca, for each \u01eb \u2208 E.\n(iii) Expectations are confirmed: the pricing function under which investors optimize co-\nincides with the equilibrium pricing function.\nProposition 1 solves for the equilibrium \u03a8 (see Equations (15, 16, 17) in the Appendix for\nan exact expression) and prices. Most proofs are contained in the Appendix, and all figures\nare at the end of the paper.\nProposition 1 (Existence) If \u03b7(h) < 1 over a set of positive Lebesgue measure, there\nexists a unique competitive equilibrium for any (\u01eb, v\u00af, \u2113) \u2208 E\u00d7 [0,\u221e)\u00d7 (0, \u2113].\nIf \u03b7 = 1 almost everywhere, there exists an equilibrium for \u2113 \u2208 [0, \u2113] and for (v\u00af, \u01eb) satisfying\n\u01eb \u2208 E(v\u00af, \u2113) := {\u01eb \u2208 E : [(\u03b8a \u2212 \u01eb)\u2032\u03a3\u02c6(\u03b8a \u2212 \u01eb)]1\/2 \u2264 (\u2113 \u2212 \u2113)\u221av\u00af}. For (v\u00af, \u01eb) such that \u01eb \u2208\nint E(v\u00af, \u2113), the equilibrium is unique, while for (v\u00af, \u01eb) such that \u01eb \u2208 \u2202E(v\u00af, \u2113) asset prices\nand consumption allocations are indeterminate (within a certain range of prices) but the\nallocation of risky assets is not. No equilibrium exists for \u01eb \u2208 E := E \\ E(v\u00af, \u2113).\nfact that risk-constraints effectively lower aggregate risk-tolerance, we feel comfortable as to the robustness\nof the results derived here. This is strengthened by the fact that for small risks (such as in a continuous-\ntime framework) the CARA-normal model is essentially true without loss of generality, even if neither\npreferences are of the CARA type nor returns are normal. In the event of \u201cnormal market conditions\u201d\nwe can think of random payoffs as being a \u201csmall\u201d risk. This strengthens the case for the CARA-normal\nmodel since the events that may lead to non-normal distributions ex-ante are embodied in the systemic\nevent. We do not assume that payoffs or returns are ex-ante normally distributed, only that payoffs are\nconditionally normally distributed.\n12\nEquilibria always exist if there are unregulated financial institutions (\u03b7 < 1 over a set of\npositive Lebesgue measure). If almost all institutions are regulated (\u03b7 = 1), then there are\ncombinations of regulatory levels v\u00af and asset endowment innovations \u2212\u01eb in which markets\ncannot clear. This happens precisely if the endowment \u03b8\u02dc\na\nthat has to be absorbed by the\nregulated financial institutions is sufficiently different from 0 so that the number of agents\nover which the risk needs to be evenly spread, \u03ba(\u01eb; v\u00af) :=\n\u221a\n(\u03b8a\u2212\u01eb)\u2032\u03a3\u02c6(\u03b8a\u2212\u01eb)\nv\u00af\n, is larger than the\npopulation: \u03ba > \u2113\u2212 \u2113. This defines the non-existence event E. This feature is not a short-\ncoming of our model. In fact, any model would exhibit such a result as it relies solely on the\nuniversality of VaR constraints. Figure 2 illustrates this phenomenon in an economy with\ntwo assets and different levels of tightness v\u00af. Each level of tightness determines an ellipsoid\nset of noise supplies that can be supported by a competitive equilibrium. For \u01eb outside\nof this ellipsoid, FIs cannot absorb the supply as described earlier, and markets break\ndown. And for a tighter regulatory level v\u00af2 < v\u00af1, the set of supportable supplies shrinks\neven further, E(v\u00af2) \u2282 E(v\u00af1). This suggests the policy implication that if the supervisory\nauthorities impose stringent risk limits (in the sense that v\u00af is small enough to lead to\nE(v\u00af) 6\u220b 0, i.e. v\u00af < \u03b8a\u2032\u03a3\u02c6\u03b8a\n(\u2113\u2212\u2113)2\n), some agents need to be exempted from those constraints for\nmarkets to clear. For derivatives, however, 0 \u2208 E, and no exemptions are required as long\nas regulations are not too strict.\n6 Equilibrium Pricing Function\nThe imposition of the VaR constraints affects the equilibria directly, with interesting results\non risk-taking, liquidity, and volatility. We present our main results about the equilibrium\npricing function during normal market conditions in a series of Propositions, with all proofs\nrelegated to the Appendix. We shall retain the following assumption in this section. Basi-\ncally it requires that the set of possible stochastic asset supplies is such that for sufficiently\nstrict regulations, some agents face binding VaR constraints. Evidently, the problem is not\ninteresting otherwise.\nAssumption [A]. For a given E assume that there is a v\u00af\u2032 such that there is a compact\nsubset of E, call it E\u2032, which is non-null, P\u01eb(E\u2032) > 0, and which is such that \u2200\u01eb \u2208 E\u2032,\n\u03ba(\u01eb) > \u2113(ln \u2113 \u2212 ln \u2113) for all v\u00af \u2264 v\u00af\u2032. Also, assume that the covariance matrix of the\nstochastic asset supplies over E\u2032, E[(\u01eb\u2212E[\u01eb])(\u01eb\u2212E[\u01eb])\u22a41\u01eb\u2208E\u2032 ], exists and is positive\ndefinite.\n13\n6.1 Prices and Risk Premia\nFrom (3) and (4) we know that the equilibrium pricing function is\nQ(\u01eb, v\u00af) =\n1\nRf\n[\n\u00b5\u02c6\u2212\u03a8(\u03ba(\u01eb, v\u00af))\u03a3\u02c6(\u03b8a \u2212 \u01eb)\n]\n(5)\nwith \u03ba(\u01eb, v\u00af) :=\n\u221a\n(\u03b8a\u2212\u01eb)\u2032\u03a3\u02c6(\u03b8a\u2212\u01eb)\nv\u00af\n. Since in economies where regulations are binding the\nreward-to-variability ratio is higher than in unregulated economies, \u03a8 > \u03b3, it follows from\n(5) that at equilibrium, a binding risk-regulation induces lower prices for a risky asset j\ncompared to the unconstrained economy iff the covariance of asset j\u2019s payoff with the payoff\nof the market portfolio \u03b8\u02dc\na\n, equivalently the beta, is positive, (\u03a3\u02c6)jthrow\u03b8\u02dc\na\n> 0, and higher\nprices otherwise. Therefore equity risk premia are higher the more tightly regulated the\neconomy is:\nProposition 2 (Equity Risk Premia) Let v\u00af2 < v\u00af1. Then \u00b5i(\u01eb, v\u00af2)\u2212Rf > \u00b5i(\u01eb, v\u00af1)\u2212Rf .\nHere \u00b5i(\u01eb, v\u00af) := \u00b5\u02c6i\/Qi(\u01eb, v\u00af) is the conditional expected return on asset i. It is indeed easy\nto see that the CAPM with respect to the market portfolio holds. For instance, the excess\nreturn on asset i is \u00b5i \u2212 Rf = \u03b2M,i(\u00b5M \u2212 Rf ), where \u00b5M \u2212 Rf = \u03a8\u03c3\u02c6\n2\nM\nqM\n. The tighter the\neconomy is regulated, the higher \u03a8 and the lower qM , generating higher expected excess\nreturns.9\nIntuitively, a more tightly regulated economy transfers risk from the less risk-averse to\nthe more risk-averse investors for markets to clear. But the latter need to be induced\nto buy into the risk by more advantageous prices, i.e. by higher expected returns. If\nthe stylized coefficients of risk-aversion are too low to match asset returns when using\nfrictionless models, the additional degree of effective risk-aversion \u03a8\u2212 \u03b3 due to risk-taking\nconstraints, such as the ones imposed by the regulatory environment, may form the basis\nof a model that attempts to address the equity premium puzzle (as outlined by Mehra and\nPrescott, 1985; Weil, 1989). This is left as an avenue for future exploration.\n6.2 Depth\nThe risk constraint affects the depth of the markets directly. In our context, depth is an\nappropriate measure of liquidity. The inverse of the depth of the entire market, shallowness\ns(\u01eb, v\u00af), is defined as the maximal extent to which an additional (unit-size) market order\n9\u03c3\u02c62M is the variance of the payoff of the residual market portfolio, and therefore exogenous. The price\nof the market portfolio, qM := q\n\u2032\u03b8\u02dc\na\nis given by R\u22121f \u00b5\u02c6\n\u2032\n\u03b8\u02dc\na \u2212 R\u22121f \u03a8(\u03b8\u02dc\na\n)\u2032\u03a3\u02c6\u03b8\u02dc\na\n, decreasing unambiguously in\n\u03a8.\n14\nfor a portfolio impacts its price. Formally,\ns(\u01eb, v\u00af) := max\n\u03b8 subject to \u2016\u03b8\u2016=1\n|\u03b8\u2032dQ| = max\n\u03b8 subject to \u2016\u03b8\u2016=1\n|\u03b8\u2032(\u2202\u01ebQ)\u03b8|\nWith this definition in mind, we can state:\nProposition 3 (Depth) Depth is lower the tighter the constraint (i.e. the smaller v\u00af),\n\u2202s(\u01eb,v\u00af)\n\u2202v\u00af\n< 0 for all \u01eb \u2208 E. In particular, depth is lower in the regulated economy than in the\nunregulated economy for any \u01eb \u2208 E.\nRefer to Figure 4 for an illustration. No RFI\u2019s risk taking constraint is binding for \u01eb \u2208\n[\u03b8a(v\u00af), \u03b8\u00afa(v\u00af)]. We have not made any assumptions regarding the distribution of \u01eb. However,\nin most cases we expect the market portfolio to be positive \u03b8\u02dc\na\n> 0. If we assume thatN = 1,\nthen the pricing function is concave over the relevant domain {\u01eb : \u03b8\u02dca > 0}, and in most\ninteresting cases \u2013large positive shocks to the asset endowment that need to be absorbed,\nor restrictive regulations\u2013 the pricing function is strictly concave. The same can be shown\nfor N > 1 given the proper restrictions on the domain of noise trades. If we assume that\nregulations are sufficiently strict so that some agents are hitting the regulatory constraint\nat \u01eb = 0, v\u00af <\n(\n\u03c3\u03b8a\n\u2113(ln \u2113\u2212ln \u2113)\n)2\n, and also that P\u01eb([\u03b8a,\u221e)) = 0, then an inflow raises prices less\nthan the corresponding outflow lowers them. This is the widespread phenomenon dubbed\nby traders as \u201cgoing up by the stairs and coming down by the elevator.\u201d\n6.3 Volatility, Diversification and Comovements\nIn the single asset case, inspection of Figure 4 reveals that the time zero asset price becomes\nmore volatile the stricter the VaR constraints are. In other words, uniform shallowness\nimplies ex-ante volatility. The single-asset intuition can then be extended to the general\ncase (a matrix M1 is more positive definite than a matrix M2 if M1 = M2 + N , with N\npositive definite):\nProposition 4 (Volatility) Consider any two levels of regulation v\u00af < v\u00af\u2032, at least one\nof them binding for some RFIs. The variance-covariance matrix of asset prices in the\nv\u00af economy is more positive definite than the one in the v\u00af\u2032 economy. It follows that the\nequilibrium price of any portfolio (and therefore of any security) becomes more volatile in\nthe economy with tighter regulations, v\u00af, than in economy v\u00af\u2032. In particular, there is more\nvolatility in the constrained economy than in the unconstrained economy.\nThe basic intuition behind these results is as follows. The endowment shocks which were\nabsorbed by the more risk neutral RFIs in economy v\u00af\u2032 now have to be absorbed in the\n15\neconomy with v\u00af < v\u00af\u2032 by the more risk averse. However, the more risk averse are less willing\nto absorb these (additional) units than the less risk averse. Hence the imposition of the risk\nconstraint reduces market depth, and the market impact of a market order is larger. Since\nthe arrival of market orders (asset endowments) is random, this generates more volatile\nasset prices.10\nThe fact that both individual assets and portfolios become necessarily more volatile suggests\nat the very least that diversification does not improve sufficiently to counteract the increases\nin the volatilities of the assets, since any portfolio, no matter how it is diversified, becomes\nmore volatile. In fact, by the multi-asset nature of our model, we can naturally show that\ncovariances between individual assets increase with stricter regulation:\nProposition 5 (Comovements) Assets that are intrinsically statistically independent\n(i.e. the payoffs as well as the endowment shocks of the assets considered are statistically\nmutually independent) become positively correlated due to risk-regulations.\nEven if two asset classes are payoff-independent and hit by independent endowment or\nnoise trader shocks, if the regulations are strict enough to bind over a set of positive\nmeasure, then a large liquidity shock hitting one asset class will induce the VaR regulation\nto bind for some RFIs. These RFIs will subsequently need to adjust their global risk\nposition, thereby creating comovements in asset prices among classes that would seem\nto be unrelated. Furthermore, these comovements would be detectable mostly in crisis\nsituations since the VaR constraints do not bind in subdued periods. It would therefore\nseem that the VaR constraints bear one further seed of instability by not only creating\nasset price volatility, but by inducing correlations during the exact periods where such\ncorrelations are most dangerous. This phenomenon is often referred to as \u201ccontagion\u201d in\nthe finance literature, e.g. in Kyle and Xiong (2001) and Kodres and Pritsker (2002).\nOur result provides a complementary contagion channel to the income effects channel,\nand clarifies why these comovements occur especially during crisis and what the impact of\nrisk-regulations on contagion could be.\n10In a certain sense the additional volatility is generated from the fact that some agents, while active in\nthe market, are restricted from participating fully. In Allen and Gale (1994) it is shown that (endogenous)\nrestricted participation (in the sense of either choosing to bear some fixed costs and fully participate, or not\nparticipate at all) also may lead to more volatile asset prices. In their two-asset setup the result is driven\nby the assumption that neither the riskless nor the long term risky asset can be shorted. This implies that\nif in equilibrium only the aggressive agents participate, then they will not hold much of a cash buffer to\nabsorb liquidity trades. As a result prices are more volatile than in a full participation equilibrium where\ncash-rich backward investors also participate.\n16\n7 How Successful is the VaR Constraint?\nTo make the regulatory problem interesting and transparent, we make the following as-\nsumption in this section:\nAssumption [B]. [B1]: (\u03b8h,t0 , \u03b8\nh,t) = 1\n\u2113\u2212\u2113\n(\u03b8a0 , \u03b8\na), all (h, t). [B2]: P({\u01eb \u2208 E : (K+q)\u2032\u03b8\u02dca \u2264\n0}) = 0. [B3]: (E,K, v\u00af) are so that 0 < P(F) < 1.\nAssumption [B1] insures a neutral distribution of endowments that is not biased in favour\nor against the success of the VaR regulations. Assumption [B2] prevents pathological\ncases whereby the value of the entire market is negative, and [B3] assumes that refinancing\nconditions are not so strict (so weak) as to lead to failure almost surely (almost never).\nProposition 6 implies that if [B] holds, the VaR regulations are effective in reducing the\nprobability of a systemic crash.11\nProposition 6 Assume that [B1] and [B2] hold.\nLowering v\u00af reduces the probability of a systemic event P(L \u2229 F) (but at the expense of a\nlower probability of market clearing P(E) if \u03b7 = 1 almost everywhere), strictly so under\n[B3]. Furthermore, if \u03b7 = 1 almost everywhere and P(\u03b8a0 \u2265 K\u2032\u03b8\u02dc\na\n) = 1, then P(L \u2229 F) = 0\nfor small enough v\u00af.\nThe reason why this policy is effective is as follows. The less risk-averse FIs hold large\namounts of the risky portfolio if regulation is weak, and therefore will have to borrow at\nthe riskless rate to finance such a risky holding, unless they are endowed with large amounts\nof assets to start with, which we exclude by condition [B]. Stricter risk-limits curb both the\namount of risky assets held by the less risk-averse RFIs as well as their required leverage, and\ntherefore make it more likely that such institutions are able to take part in the refinancing\nof the firms. The more subtle point is, however, that stricter VaR limits reduce prices\nand thereby induce UFIs, and in particular the less risk-averse ones, to purchase the risky\nassets sold by the RFIs. This effect may indicate that systemic risk can increase with a\ntightening of regulations. But the non-trivial general equilibrium effect on prices and the\ndifferential elasticities if demand for risk-averse versus less risk-averse investors means that\nbuyers (the UFIs and the more risk averse RFIs) can purchase their larger holdings in risky\nassets at lower prices. The net effect is that the less risk-averse leave in equilibrium more\nof their wealth invested in the riskless asset (sold to them by the more risk-averse agents),\ncreating less of a systemic imbalance despite holding riskier portfolios. This benefit must\nbe balanced by the loss of diversification and risk-sharing, by more shallow markets and\nthe increased volatility of prices during normal market conditions. And if \u03b7 = 1 almost\n11If \u03b7 = 1 almost everywhere and if \u01eb is so that there is no market clearing price vector, then we assume\nthat markets shut and allocations coincide with endowments. In particular, E \u2282 Fc.\n17\neverywhere, the regulator faces a further cost in that markets may not clear. For very strict\nlevels of v\u00af and very inclusive regulations, and provided the economy in aggregate does have\nenough of the riskless asset, then the probability of a systemic crash goes to zero, but the\nlikelihood of market clearing is reduced as well.\nThe effectiveness also depends on the distribution and relative mass of RFIs as encapsulated\nin \u03b7(h). For instance, ceteris paribus, in an economy where \u03b7 does not depend on h the\nregulations are more effective than in an economy where \u03b7(h) = 0 for h \u2208 [\u2113, \u2113+ (\u2113\u2212 \u2113)\/2]\nand \u03b7(h) = 1 otherwise, for there the regulated institutions are not the ones imposing the\nexternalities while the more risk-tolerant FIs that impose the majority of externalities are\nall unregulated.\nWe would like to conclude with a simple welfare analysis. While VaR based regulation is\neffective in the sense of lowering the probability of a systemic event, in light of the afore-\nmentioned welfare costs of regulation during normal market times it does not automatically\nfollow though that risk sensitive regulation is socially beneficial. Whereas a general wel-\nfare study would take us too far afield, the following general observations illustrate the\nintuition that some regulation might be welfare enhancing while too strict a regulation\nwould be detrimental. In a nutshell, provided subsistence consumption x is low enough,\na strengthening of regulations will lower the probability of a systemic event and thereby\nincrease expected utility. This is true up to a point beyond which further regulations are\ndetrimental to welfare. The following argument formally proves this point.\nExpected utility of FI h is given by the integral of uh(xh) over the product measure PL\u00d7\u01eb\u00d7d.\nGiven a realisation of the liquidity and the endowment shocks (L, \u01eb), write the expected\nutility over asset return realisations as Ed[uh(xh)](\u01eb,L) := w(\u01eb,L; v\u00af). We then have the\nex-ante utility\nE[uh(xh)] = PL(L)\n\u222b\n\u01eb\u2208F\nw(\u01eb,L)dP\u01eb(\u01eb) + PL(L)\n\u222b\n\u01eb\u2208Fc\nw(\u01eb,Lc)dP\u01eb(\u01eb)\n+ (1\u2212 PL(L)\n\u222b\n\u01eb\u2208E\nw(\u01eb,Lc)dP\u01eb(\u01eb)\n= PL(L)P\u01eb(F)uh(x) +\n\u222b\n\u01eb\u2208E\nw(\u01eb,Lc)dP\u01eb(\u01eb)\u2212 PL(L)\n\u222b\n\u01eb\u2208F\nw(\u01eb,Lc)dP\u01eb(\u01eb) (6)\n= PL(L)P\u01eb(F)\n[\nuh(x)\u2212E\u01eb[w(\u01eb,Lc)\u2016\u01eb \u2208 F]\n]\n+ E\u01eb[w(\u01eb,Lc)] (7)\nEquation (7) illustrates the tradeoffs. As regulations become stricter, utility during normal\nmarket times decreases due to the various reasons mentioned before, which has to be\nbalanced against the reduced probability of a systemic crisis. By Proposition 6, ex-ante\nutilility is increasing with a lower v\u00af if uh(x) is low enough, at least up to the point where\nP(F) = 0. From that point onwards, ex-ante utility is decreasing with a lower v\u00af. This can\nalso be gleaned directly by differentiating the expression above to get that welfare increases\n18\nwith a smaller v\u00af iff\n(1\u2212 PL(L))\n\u222b\nE\n\u2202wh(\u01eb,Lc; v\u00af)\n\u2202v\u00af\ndP\u01eb(\u01eb) + PL(L)\n\u222b\nF(v\u00af)c\n\u2202wh(\u01eb,Lc; v\u00af)\n\u2202v\u00af\ndP\u01eb(\u01eb)\n< PL(L)\n\u222b\n\u2202v\u00afF(v\u00af)\n[wh(\u01eb,Lc; v\u00af)\u2212 uh(x)]dP\u01eb(\u01eb)\nThe LHS represents the incremental welfare costs due to stricter regulation (the costs\nexpected to be borne during normal market times) while the RHS represents the welfare\ngains due to the resulting lower probability of a systemic crash. By Proposition 6 we know\nthat F becomes smaller if v\u00af becomes smaller, and as long as that area \u2202v\u00afF(v\u00af) is in the\nsupport of P\u01eb, which we assume, a low enough x guarantees that stricter regulations lead\nto a Pareto dominating allocation. When regulation is strict enough so that P(F) is small\nenough, say zero, then the LHS is\n\u222b\nE\n\u2202wh(\u01eb,Lc;v\u00af)\n\u2202v\u00af\ndP\u01eb(\u01eb) > 0 and the RHS is zero: the marginal\ncosts outstrip the marginal gains. This suggests that the optimal level of regulation should\nbe set at the interior point where the (possibly weighted) integral of the LHS over all h\n(the marginal social welfare cost) equals the (possibly weighted) integral of the RHS (the\nmarginal social welfare gain).\n8 Conclusion\nThe aim of this paper is two-fold. First, we are interested in modelling the underlying causes\nwhich generate systemic risk and lead to a rationale for regulating risk. This is in contrast\nwith most models which impose risk regulation upon a first-best economy and where the\nconclusions may not be meaningful or realistic. We then study why and to what extent the\ncurrent risk-regulation alleviates systemic risk. We show that risk-sensitive regulations of\nthe VaR type do reduce the probability of a systemic event and therefore do alleviate some\nof the free-riding externalities. Such benefits do have to be balanced by the social costs\nimposed by the regulations. Pricing risk is shown to be endogenous. We demonstrate that\nthe fact of regulating risk-taking changes the statistical properties of financial risk. Markets\nmay not clear if regulations are too all-encompassing. We also derive equity premia which\nare larger than in standard models, going some way towards a resolution of the equity\npremium puzzle. We show that illiquidity, volatility and covariations are all larger than in\nan unregulated world. In particular they are especially large in periods of distress. This\nis so because in periods of distress, such as during panic sales, the market price of risk\nparameter \u03a8, which also acts as the effective risk aversion parameter, is large. Markets\nact as if aggregate risk aversion went up, with less depth and more local volatility as a\nresult, as illustrated on Figure 4. It is well-known that risk-modelling often fails in periods\nof stress due to the breakdown of established historical comovements. Our model exhibits\nsome of the nonlinearities at the heart of this phenomenon and exhibits conditions under\nwhich there is an optimal interior amount of risk-sensitive regulation.\n19\nA Proofs\nProof of Lemma 1 The program consists in solving (the superscript d indicates that the\nexpectation is computed with respect to the probability of the payoffs d)\nmax\n{yh,yh\n0\n}\nEd\n[\nuh(d0[\u03b8\nh\n0 + q\n\u2032\u03b8\u02dc\nh \u2212 q\u2032yh] + d\u2032yh)|\u01eb\n]\n\u2212 \u03bbh\n[\nyh\n\u2032\n\u03a3\u02c6yh \u2212 v\u00af\n]\nThe FOCs (the program is strictly convex and constraint qualification holds), so the FOCs\nare both necessary and sufficient) are Ed\n[\nuh\n\u2032\n(W h)(d\u2212 d0q)|\u01eb\n]\n= 2\u03bbh\u03a3\u02c6yh, or equivalently\nCovd(uh\n\u2032\n(W h),d|\u01eb) + Ed\n[\nuh\n\u2032\n(W h)|\u01eb\n]\nE[d]\u2212 d0Ed\n[\nuh\n\u2032\n(W h)|\u01eb\n]\nq = 2\u03bbh\u03a3\u02c6yh\nNext, by Stein\u2019s Lemma [recall that Stein\u2019s Lemma asserts that if x and y are multivari-\nate normal, if g is everywhere differentiable and if E[g\u2032(y)] < \u221e, then Cov(x, g(y)) =\nE[g\u2032(y)]Cov(x, y)] and the fact that Covd(d,W h|\u01eb) = Covd(d,d\u2032yh|\u01eb) = \u03a3\u02c6yh we get that:\nyh =\n1\n\u03b1h + \u03c6h\n\u03a3\u02c6\n\u22121\n[\u00b5\u02c6\u2212 d0q]\nwhere we also used the fact that in this CARA\u2013Normal setup \u2212E\nd[uh\n\u2032\u2032\n|\u01eb]\nEd[uh\u2032|\u01eb]\n= \u03b1h, and where\nwe defined \u03c6h := 2\u03bb\nh\nEd[uh\u2032|\u01eb]\n.\nFinally, we\u2019ll derive the expression for \u03b1h + \u03c6h and show that it does not depend on the\nwealth of the institution. In order to accomplish this, we first need to find an expression\nfor \u03c6h. To simplify expressions, define\n\u03c1 := (\u00b5\u02c6\u2212Rfq)\u2032 \u03a3\u02c6\u22121 (\u00b5\u02c6\u2212 Rfq) (8)\nIt can easily be established that\nyh\n\u2032\n\u03a3\u02c6yh = v\u00af (and \u03bbh \u2265 0)\u21d2 \u03b1h + \u03c6h =\n\u221a\n\u03c1\nv\u00af\n(9)\nyh\n\u2032\n\u03a3\u02c6yh < v\u00af (so \u03bbh = 0)\u21d2 \u03b1h + \u03c6h = \u03b1h (10)\nIndeed, assume that yh\n\u2032\n\u03a3\u02c6yh = v\u00af. Since yh = 1\n\u03b1h+\u03c6h\n\u03a3\u02c6(\u00b5\u02c6 \u2212 Rfq), this expression becomes(\n1\n\u03b1h+\u03c6h\n)2\n\u03c1 = v\u00af. Of course, if yh\n\u2032\n\u03a3\u02c6yh < v\u00af then \u03bbh = 0 and thus \u03c6h = 0.\nThis implies that \u03b1h + \u03c6h is independent of W h0 for given prices,\n\u03b1h + \u03c6h = max\n{\n\u03b1h,\n\u221a\n\u03c1\nv\u00af\n}\n(11)\n20\nIndeed, assume first that yh\n\u2032\n\u03a3\u02c6yh < v\u00af. Then by (10) we have that \u03b1h + \u03c6h = \u03b1h, so we\nneed to show that \u03b1h \u2265 \u221a\u03c1\nv\u00af\n. Now since yh\n\u2032\n\u03a3\u02c6yh = \u03b1h\n\u22122\n\u03c1, we know that \u03b1h\n\u22122\n\u03c1 < v\u00af, so\nthat indeed \u03b1h >\n\u221a\n\u03c1\nv\u00af\n. Next, assume that yh\n\u2032\n\u03a3\u02c6yh = v\u00af. Then from (9) \u03b1h + \u03c6h =\n\u221a\n\u03c1\nv\u00af\n. So\nwe need to establish that \u03b1h \u2264\u221a\u03c1\nv\u00af\n, which follows from \u03c6h \u2265 0.\nProof of Proposition 1 Before we proceed to the proof, notice that by Walras\u2019 Law,\nthe markets for the riskless asset and for consumption clear if the market for risky assets\nclears. Indeed, denote aggregated FIs quantities by a superscript a: for any quantity x,\u222b \u2113\n\u2113\n(\u03b7(h)xh,r + (1\u2212 \u03b7(h))xh,u)dh = xa. Walras\u2019 Law at times 0 and 2 says that (ya0 \u2212 \u03b8a0) +\nq\u2032(ya \u2212 \u03b8a + \u01eb) = 0 [W0] and xa = d0ya0 + d\u2032ya [W2]. So assume that ya \u2212 \u03b8a + \u01eb = 0.\nThen by [W0] the market for the riskless asset clears as well, and by [W2] we immediately\nhave clearing of the commodities market, xa = d0\u03b8\na\n0 + d\n\u2032(\u03b8a \u2212 \u01eb), under \u201cnormal market\nconditions.\u201d\nWe now exhibit a solution to the fixed-point problem of existence. Fix some \u01eb \u2208 E and\nassume first that \u2113 > 0. Recall from (4) that\n\u03a8\u22121 =\n\u222b \u2113\n\u2113\n\u03b7(h)\n1\n\u03b1h + \u03c6h,r\ndh+\n\u222b \u2113\n\u2113\n(1\u2212 \u03b7(h)) 1\n\u03b1h\ndh\n=\n\u222b\nI1\n\u03b7(h)\n1\n\u03b1h\ndh+\n\u222b\nI2\n\u03b7(h)\n\u221a\nv\u00af\n\u03c1\ndh+\n\u222b \u2113\n\u2113\n(1\u2212 \u03b7(h)) 1\n\u03b1h\ndh (12)\nwhere I1 :=\n{\nh \u2208 [\u2113, \u2113] : \u03b1h >\u221a\u03c1\nv\u00af\n}\nand I2 :=\n{\nh \u2208 [\u2113, \u2113] : \u03b1h \u2264\u221a\u03c1\nv\u00af\n}\n.\nIn order to solve for the equilibrium, we use (3) to express q as a function of \u03a8 and then\nsolve (12) for \u03a8.\nFor convenience, we establish some preliminary calculations and notation. First, insert\nthe pricing relation (3) into the definition of \u03c1 from (8) to get the expression\n\u221a\n\u03c1 =\n\u03a8\n\u221a\n(\u03b8a \u2212 \u01eb)\u2032\u03a3\u02c6(\u03b8a \u2212 \u01eb). Second, define the relation\n\u03ba(\u01eb) :=\n\u221a\n(\u03b8a \u2212 \u01eb)\u2032\u03a3\u02c6(\u03b8a \u2212 \u01eb)\nv\u00af\n\u2261 \u03a8\u22121\n\u221a\n\u03c1\nv\u00af\n(13)\n\u03ba(\u01eb) represents the ratio of the standard deviation of the dividends of the residual market\nportfolio \u03b8a \u2212 \u01eb to the maximal allowable standard deviation of the payoffs of individ-\nual portfolios. Now we also use the assumption that \u03b1h = h. There are three cases to\ndistinguish:\nAssume first that \u03ba\u03a8 \u2264 \u2113. Then we get \u03a8 = 1\nln \u2113\u2212ln \u2113\n.\n21\nNext, assume that \u03ba\u03a8 \u2208 (\u2113, \u2113). Then\n\u03a8\u22121 = (ln \u2113\u2212 ln \u2113)\u2212\n\u222b \u03a8\u03ba\n\u2113\n[h\u22121 \u2212 (\u03a8\u03ba)\u22121]\u03b7(h)dh (14)\nFinally, assume that \u03ba\u03a8 \u2265 \u2113, in which case \u03a8 = 1\u2212\u03ba\n\u22121\nR \u2113\n\u2113\n\u03b7(h)dh\nR \u2113\n\u2113\n(1\u2212\u03b7(h)) 1\nh\ndh\n.\nThis system is equivalent to the following, where we define \u03ba := \u2113(ln \u2113 \u2212 ln \u2113) and \u03ba :=\n\u2113\n\u222b \u2113\n\u2113\n(1\u2212 \u03b7(h))h\u22121dh+ \u222b \u2113\n\u2113\n\u03b7(h)dh:\n\u03a8 =\n1\nln \u2113\u2212 ln \u2113 if \u03ba \u2264 \u03ba (15)\n\u03a8\u22121 = ln \u2113\u2212 ln \u2113\u2212\n\u222b \u03ba\u03a8\n\u2113\n[h\u22121 \u2212 (\u03ba\u03a8)\u22121]\u03b7(h)dh if \u03ba \u2208 (\u03ba, \u03ba) (16)\n\u03a8 =\n1\u2212 \u03ba\u22121 \u222b \u2113\n\u2113\n\u03b7(h)dh\u222b \u2113\n\u2113\n(1\u2212 \u03b7(h)) 1\nh\ndh\nif \u03ba \u2265 \u03ba (17)\nThat the systems are equivalent can be verified as follows. First assume \u03ba \u2264 \u03ba and\n\u03a8 = 1\nln \u2113\u2212ln \u2113\n. Then \u03a8\u03ba \u2264 \u2113, which warrants the choice of \u03a8. Now assume \u03ba \u2208 (\u03ba, \u03ba).\nPremultiply (16) by \u03ba\u22121 and use the assumption that \u03ba > \u2113 to get \u03ba\u03a8 > \u2113. Now assume to\nthe contrary that \u03ba\u03a8 \u2265 \u2113. Using the fact that \u03b7(h) = 0 if h > \u2113, (16) can be rearranged by\ngrouping the \u03ba\u03a8 terms to say (\u03ba\u03a8)\u22121 =\nln \u2113\u2212ln \u2113\u2212\nR \u2113\n\u2113\nh\u22121\u03b7(h)dh\n\u03ba\u2212\nR \u2113\n\u2113\n\u03b7(h)dh\n\u2264 \u2113\u22121 by assumption. Rewriting\nwe get \u03ba \u2265 \u03ba, a contradiction. So \u03ba\u03a8 < \u2113. Finally, assume \u03ba \u2265 \u03ba. Using (17) we get that\n\u03ba\u03a8 \u2265 \u2113, which in turn justifies our choice of \u03a8.\nRecall that \u01eb affects \u03a8 only in as far as it affects \u03ba, \u03a8(\u03ba). For each \u03ba, there is a unique \u03a8\nsolving this system. For the regions \u03ba \u2264 \u03ba and \u03ba \u2265 \u03ba this is obvious. So assume \u03ba \u2208 (\u03ba, \u03ba).\nUsing x for \u03ba\u03a8, we rewrite (16) as x = RHS(x) :=\n\u03ba+\nR x\n\u2113\n[xh\u22121\u22121]\u03b7(h)dh\nln \u2113\u2212ln \u2113\n. It is easy to see\nthat the mapping RHS(x) is weakly increasing and convex, with slope strictly less than\n1. Since RHS(\u2113) = limx\u0581\u2113RHS(x) =\n\u03ba\nln \u2113\u2212ln \u2113\n. Assume that \u03ba\nln \u2113\u2212ln \u2113\n\u2264 \u2113, then \u03ba \u2264 \u03ba, a\ncontradiction, so RHS(\u2113) > \u2113. Similarly, RHS(\u2113) < \u2113 from the assumption \u03ba < \u03ba. It\nfollows that there is one and only one fixed point x \u2208 (\u2113, \u2113).\nNotice that if \u03b7 = 1 almost everywhere, then\n\u03a8(\u03ba) =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\n1\nln \u2113\u2212ln \u2113\n; \u03ba \u2208 [0, \u2113(ln \u2113\u2212 ln \u2113)]\n\u2212 \u03ba+\u2113\n\u03baW\u22121(\u2212(\u03ba+\u2113) exp(\u22121\u2212ln \u2113))\n; \u03ba \u2208 (\u2113(ln \u2113\u2212 ln \u2113), \u2113\u2212 \u2113)\nany number \u2265 \u2113\n\u2113\u2212\u2113\n; \u03ba = \u2113\u2212 \u2113\nundefined ; \u03ba > \u2113\u2212 \u2113\n22\nwhereW\u22121(\u00b7) is the non-principal (lower) branch of the LambertW -correspondence. Recall\nthat the Lambert W -correspondence is defined as the multivariate inverse of the function\nw 7\u2192 wew. In particular, the solution to ax+ b ln x + c = 0 is given by x = b\na\nW\u22121\n(\na\nb\ne\u2212\nc\nb\n)\n.\nNotice that the mapping \u03a8 is C1 (but not C2 since the second derivative to the left of\n\u2113(ln \u2113 \u2212 ln \u2113) is zero while the second derivative to the right is \u03b7\n\u21132(ln(\u2113)\u2212ln(\u2113))4\n> 0) and that\nby construction the equilibrium \u03a8 satisfies \u03a8 \u2265 \u03b3.\nOver the entire domain the function \u03a8(\u03ba) is illustrated in figure (3). In the case for \u03b7 = 1\nand \u03ba = 1 \u2212 \u2113, which is equivalent to \u01eb being on the boundary of E, the equilibrium can\nbe shown to exhibit real indeterminacy.\nProof of Proposition 3 As preliminaries, let us record the following useful results:\nJ1 \u2202\u03ba\n\u2202v\u00af\n= \u22121\n2\n\u03ba\nv\u00af\n, from the definition of \u03ba, and \u2202\u01eb\u03ba = \u03ba\n\u22121v\u00af\u22121\u03a3\u02c6(\u01eb\u2212 \u03b8a).\nJ2 \u22022\u01eb,v\u00af\u03a8 = \u2212 12v\u00af\n[\n\u03ba\u2202\n2\u03a8\n\u2202\u03ba2\n+ \u2202\u03a8\n\u2202\u03ba\n]\n\u2202\u01eb\u03ba. Indeed, since\nd\u03a8\ndv\u00af\n= \u2202\u03a8\n\u2202\u03ba\n\u2202\u03ba\n\u2202v\u00af\n, we know from J1 that \u22022\u01eb,v\u00af\u03a8 =\nd\nd\u01eb\n(\n\u2202\u03a8\n\u2202\u03ba\n\u2202\u03ba\n\u2202v\u00af\n)\n=\u2202\u03ba\n\u2202v\u00af\n\u22022\u03a8\n\u2202\u03ba2\n\u2202\u01eb\u03ba+\n\u2202\u03a8\n\u2202\u03ba\n\u2202\u01eb\n(\u22121\n2\n\u03ba\nv\u00af\n)\n.\nJ3 \u2202\u01ebQ is positive definite (downward-sloping equilibrium inverse demand). Indeed, \u2202\u01ebQ =\nR\u22121f\n[\n\u03a8\u03a3\u02c6\u2212 \u03a3\u02c6(\u03b8a \u2212 \u01eb)(\u2202\u01eb\u03a8)\u2032\n]\n=R\u22121f\n[\n\u03a8\u03a3\u02c6+ \u03a3\u02c6(\u03b8a \u2212 \u01eb) (\u03b8a \u2212 \u01eb)\u2032\u03a3\u02c6\u03ba\u22121v\u00af\u22121 \u2202\u03a8\n\u2202\u03ba\n]\n, positive\ndefinite.\nJ4 For \u03ba \u2208 (\u03ba, \u03ba), \u2202\u03a8\n\u2202\u03ba\n=\n\u03ba\u22122\nR \u03ba\u03a8\n\u2113\n\u03b7(h)dh\nln \u2113\u2212ln \u2113\u2212\nR \u03ba\u03a8\n\u2113\nh\u22121\u03b7(h)dh\n> 0. Indeed, totally differentiate (16) and use\n(16) to sign.\nThe idea of the proof is to show that \u22022\u01eb,v\u00afQ is negative definite. Intuitively, we want to\nshow that the market impact of a trade goes up as the regulation is tightened, i.e. that\n\u2202\n\u2202v\u00af\n|(dq)\u2032(d\u01eb)| = \u2202\n\u2202v\u00af\n[(dq)\u2032(d\u01eb)] < 0 since (dq)\u2032(d\u01eb) > 0 as \u2202\u01ebQ is positive definite by J3. Now\nthis expression equals \u2202\n\u2202v\u00af\n[(d\u01eb)\u2032\u2202\u01ebQ(d\u01eb)] = (d\u01eb)\n\u2032\u22022\u01eb,v\u00afQ(d\u01eb) < 0 for all d\u01eb 6= 0, but that\u2019s the\ndefinition of negative definiteness.\nBefore we show that \u22022\u01eb,v\u00afQ(d\u01eb) is negative definite, we want to relate this idea to the\ndefinition of shallowness, s(\u01eb, v\u00af) := max\u03b8 |\u03b8\u2032(\u2202\u01ebQ)\u03b8| such that \u2016\u03b8\u2016 = 1, namely that \u2202s\u2202v\u00af < 0\niff \u22022\u01eb,v\u00afQ negative definite. Indeed, pick any \u03b8 such that \u2016\u03b8\u2016 = 1, then it is immediate that\n\u2202(\u03b8\u2032\u2202\u01ebQ\u03b8)\n\u2202v\u00af\n= \u03b8\u2032 (\u2212\u2202\u01eb,v\u00afQ) \u03b8, which proves the claim. A tighter v\u00af makes \u2202\u01ebQ more positive\ndefinite.\nThe pricing function is Q(\u01eb, v\u00af) = R\u22121f\n[\n\u00b5\u02c6\u2212\u03a8\u03a3\u02c6(\u03b8a \u2212 \u01eb)\n]\n, from which we can deduce that\n\u2202v\u00afQ = \u2212R\u22121f \u03a3\u02c6(\u03b8a \u2212 \u01eb)d\u03a8dv\u00af , and furthermore that \u22022\u01eb,v\u00afQ = R\u22121f \u03a3\u02c6d\u03a8dv\u00af \u2212 R\u22121f \u03a3\u02c6(\u03b8a \u2212 \u01eb)\u22022\u01eb,v\u00af\u03a8.\nThis expression can be simplified, using J2, to\n\u22022\u01eb,v\u00afQ = \u2212\n1\n2\nR\u22121f\n\u2202\u03a8\n\u2202\u03ba\n\u03ba\nv\u00af\n\u03a3\u02c6\u2212 1\n2\nR\u22121f v\u00af\n\u22122\n[\n\u22022\u03a8\n\u2202\u03ba2\n\u03ba +\n\u2202\u03a8\n\u2202\u03ba\n] [\n\u03a3\u02c6(\u03b8a \u2212 \u01eb)(\u03b8a \u2212 \u01eb)\u2032\u03a3\u02c6\n]\n\u03ba\u22121\n23\nThe first term is negative definite by J4, while the second one is negative semidefinite.\nIndeed, it can be shown that the expression\n[\n\u22022\u03a8\n\u2202\u03ba2\n\u03ba + \u2202\u03a8\n\u2202\u03ba\n]\nis strictly positive, while the term[\n\u03a3\u02c6(\u03b8a \u2212 \u01eb)(\u03b8a \u2212 \u01eb)\u2032\u03a3\u02c6\n]\nis clearly positive semidefinite. This concludes the proof that \u22022\u01eb,v\u00afQ\nis negative definite.\nProof of Proposition 4 The variance-covariance matrix of prices is given by\n\u2126 := E[(Q\u2212 E[Q])(Q\u2212E[Q])\u22a4]\n=\n1\nR2f\n\u03a3\u02c6E[\u03a82(\u03b8a \u2212 \u01eb)(\u03b8a \u2212 \u01eb)\u22a4]\u03a3\u02c6\u2212 1\nR2f\n\u03a3\u02c6E[\u03a8(\u03b8a \u2212 \u01eb)]E[\u03a8(\u03b8a \u2212 \u01eb)\u22a4]\u03a3\u02c6\nDifferentiation this matrix with respect to v\u00af we get\n\u2202v\u00af\u2126 =\n1\nR2f\n\u03a3\u02c6E\n[\n2\u03a8\n\u2202\u03a8\n\u2202v\u00af\n(\u03b8a \u2212 \u01eb)(\u03b8a \u2212 \u01eb)\u22a4\n]\n\u03a3\u02c6\u2212\n1\nR2f\n\u03a3\u02c6\n[\nE[\u03a8(\u03b8a \u2212 \u01eb)]E\n[\n\u2202\u03a8\n\u2202v\u00af\n(\u03b8a \u2212 \u01eb)\n]\u22a4\n+ E\n[\n\u2202\u03a8\n\u2202v\u00af\n(\u03b8a \u2212 \u01eb)\n]\nE[\u03a8(\u03b8a \u2212 \u01eb)]\u22a4\n]\n\u03a3\u02c6\nIn view of the nonpositive sign of \u2202\u03a8\n\u2202v\u00af\n, both matrices are NSD. We show next that the first\nmatrix is, in interesting economies at least where the VaR constraint does bind, in fact\nND. Write w := \u2212\u03a8\u2202\u03a8\n\u2202v\u00af\n, a positive random variable. By assumption [A], there is a strictly\npositive w := inf\u01eb\u2208E\u2032 w and furthermore\nE[(\u03b8a \u2212 \u01eb)(\u03b8a \u2212 \u01eb)\u22a41\u01eb\u2208E\u2032 ] is PD\nIt follows that\ndetwE[(\u03b8a \u2212 \u01eb)(\u03b8a \u2212 \u01eb)\u22a41\u01eb\u2208E\u2032 ] > 0\n\u21d2 detE[w(\u03b8a \u2212 \u01eb)(\u03b8a \u2212 \u01eb)\u22a41\u01eb\u2208E\u2032 ] > 0\n\u21d2 detE[w(\u03b8a \u2212 \u01eb)(\u03b8a \u2212 \u01eb)\u22a4] > 0\nThis shows that \u2202v\u00af\u2126 is ND. It follows that stricter regulations (lower v\u00af) make the variance-\ncovariance matrix of prices more positive definite, and in particular each variance increases.\nSince the variance of a portfolio \u03b8 \u2208 RN is \u03b8\u22a4\u2126\u03b8, the variance of any portfolio increases\nas (binding) regulations become stricter.\nProof of Proposition 5 Consider any two assets, say assets 1 and 2. Intrinsic inde-\npendence requires \u03a3\u02c6 diagonal, \u01eb1 and \u01eb2 stochastically independent, and the absence of\nregulations so that \u03a8 = \u03d5. Then Q1(\u01eb1) and Q2(\u01eb2), so Q1 and Q2 are stochastically\nindependent.\n24\nSince Qi =\n[\n\u00b5\u02c6i \u2212\u03a8(\u01eb)\u03a3\u02c6i(\u03b8a \u2212 \u01eb)\n]\n\/Rf ,\nCov(Q1, Q2) = \u03a3\u02c611\u03a3\u02c622Cov(\u03a8\u03b8\u02dc1,\u03a8\u03b8\u02dc2)\n1\nR2f\n\u2265 0\nwith \u03a8(\u03b8\u02dc1, \u03b8\u02dc2). The last inequality follows from the fact that independent rvs are associated,\nsee Esary et al. (1967). Indeed, with \u03b8\u02dc1 stochastically independent of \u03b8\u02dc2, any increasing\nfunctions (\u03c61, \u03c62) satisfy Cov(\u03c61(\u03b8\u02dc1, \u03b8\u02dc2), \u03c62(\u03b8\u02dc1, \u03b8\u02dc2)) \u2265 0, i.e. (\u03b8\u02dc1, \u03b8\u02dc2) are associated.

We now show that Fv\u00af \u2282 Fv\u00af\u2032 if v\u00af < v\u00af\u2032. So pick \u01eb \u2208 Fv\u00af. Then S(v\u00af) > S\u00af.\nIf \u01eb is so that Sh as a function of h is either uniformly nonnegative or uniformly nonpositive,\nthen by F1 S(v\u00af) = S(v\u00af\u2032). It follows that \u01eb \u2208 Fv\u00af\u2032 .\nOtherwise if Sh is neither nonnegative nor nonpositive for all h (and there must be a non-\nnull set of such \u01eb by [B3]), then we have two cases. Consider first the case h\u02dc > \u03a8\u03ba. If\nSh\u02dc(v\u00af) = Sh\u02dc(v\u00af\u2032) > 0, then by F4 (the absolute value of) the integral of the negative part\nof Sh(v\u00af\u2032) is larger than the one of Sh(v\u00af). Since by F1 the overall areas must coincide, the\nintegral of the positive part of Sh(v\u00af\u2032) is larger than the one of Sh(v\u00af), i.e. S(v\u00af\u2032) > S(v\u00af). If\non the other hand Sh\u02dc(v\u00af) = Sh\u02dc(v\u00af\u2032) < 0, then we can focus on the positive parts of the two\nfunctions directly, since in that case Sh(v\u00af\u2032) > Sh(v\u00af) for h s.t. Sh(v\u00af) > 0, from which again\nwe can deduce that S(v\u00af\u2032) > S(v\u00af).\nConsider now the case h\u02dc < \u03a8\u03ba. By the assumption that h\u02dc < \u03a8\u03ba, Sh(v\u00af\u2032) < Sh(v\u00af) for all\nh > \u03a8\u03ba (by F5). The area of the negative part of Sh(v\u00af\u2032) is larger than the one of Sh(v\u00af), so\n(again by F1) must be the positive areas, i.e. S(v\u00af\u2032) > S(v\u00af).\nIt follows that \u01eb \u2208 Fv\u00af\u2032 and that Fv\u00af \u2282 Fv\u00af\u2032 .\nNow we show that if \u03b7 = 1 and P(\u03b8a0 \u2265 K\u2032\u03b8\u02dc\na\n) = 1, then P(L \u2229 F) = 0 for small enough\nv\u00af.
