Using the cranked Woods-Saxon-Strutinsky method, including configuration constraints, it is found\nthat collective oblate rotation coexists with high-K prolate rotation, for tantalum and rhenium isotopes with\nN = 115 and 117.\nDOI: 10.1103\/PhysRevC.74.067303 PACS number(s): 21.10.Gv, 21.10.Re, 21.60.\u2212n, 27.80.+w\nFollowing from the prediction by Hilton and Mang [1] of\n\u201cgiant backbending\u201d in 180Hf, caused by a collective oblate\nrotational band crossing the prolate ground-state band, there\nhas been further theoretical investigation of this phenomenon\n[2\u20135]. The calculated shape change is understood to be induced\nby the effects of rotation alignment. It is related to the\nprediction of a ground-state shape transition from prolate to\noblate with increasing neutron number [5\u20138] in the same\nmass region. An important consideration is the reinforcing\neffect of the protons and neutrons, both of which have their\nFermi levels high in their respective shells. Thus high-K\ncouplings for prolate shapes compete with low-K couplings\nfor oblate shapes. It is the rotation alignment of the latter that,\nunusually, enables collective oblate rotation (\u03b3 = \u221260\u25e6 in the\nLund convention) to become yrast, i.e., to have the lowest\nexcitation energy at a given angular momentum. Nevertheless,\nthe experimental situation remains inconclusive [4,5,9].\nThe present work gives further theoretical insight by\nstudying odd-odd nuclei in the neutron-rich A \u2248 190 region.\nThe initial supposition was that, since the proton and neutron\nshape-driving effects reinforce one another, it may be sufficient\nto have a single nucleon of each type in order to manifest the\nprolate-oblate shape coexistence. This is indeed found from\nthe calculations, as shown below, and may lead to improved\nexperimental opportunities to test the predictions.\nTotal Routhian surface (TRS) calculations have been\nperformed for odd-odd N = 115 and 117 isotopes of tan-\ntalum (Z = 73), rhenium (Z = 75), and iridium (Z = 77),\ncomplementing our earlier study of even-even nuclides [5].\nThe single-particle energies are obtained from the deformed\nWoods-Saxon potential [10], with the Lipkin-Nogami (LN)\ntreatment of pairing [11]. This avoids the spurious pairing\nphase transition encountered in the simpler BCS approach.\nThe pairing strength, G, is determined by the average-gap\nmethod [12]. The total energy of a configuration consists\nof a macroscopic part which is obtained from the standard\nliquid-drop model [13] and a microscopic part resulting from\nthe Strutinsky shell correction [14], \u03b4Eshell = ELN \u2212 \u02dcEStrut.\nCalculations are performed in the lattice of quadrupole (\u03b22, \u03b3 )\ndeformations with hexadecapole (\u03b24) variation. For a given\n*Electronic address: p.walker@surrey.ac.uk\nrotational frequency, pairing is treated self-consistently by\nsolving the cranked LN equation at any given point of the\ndeformation lattice and then the equilibrium deformation is\ndetermined by minimizing the obtained TRS (for details, see,\ne.g., Refs. [15,16]). Configuration-constrained calculations\nhave been performed in the absence of rotation, as described\nby Xu et al. [17].\nThe critical neutron number for prolate-oblate shape\ncoexistence is close to N = 116. This was discussed for\neven-even 190W116 [5], where, a K\u03c0 = 10\u2212 two-quasineutron\n(2\u03bd) prolate excitation is predicted to be at similar energy to\nan I\u03c0 \u2248 10+, 2\u03bd oblate excitation. The focus of the present\nwork is on the neighboring odd-odd nuclides 188,190Ta and\n190,192Re. Their TRS diagrams for negative parity are shown\nin Fig. 1 at low rotational frequency, h\u00af\u03c9 = 0.1 MeV. In each\ncase the ground state, at h\u00af\u03c9 = 0, is prolate. Comparison can\nalso be made with configuration-constrained calculations. The\nK\u03c0 = 10\u2212{\u03c09\/2\u2212[514] \u2297 \u03bd11\/2+[615]} Nilsson configura-\ntion is calculated to have prolate shape (see Table I) and\nis at low excitation energy. Indeed, it may form the ground\nstate, though lower-K configurations cannot be ruled out.\n(There is experimental evidence for an I\u03c0 = (2)\u2212 ground\nstate in 192Re [18].) In contrast, at low rotational frequency,\nh\u00af\u03c9 \u2248 0.1 MeV, the oblate, \u03c0h11\/2 \u2297 \u03bdi13\/2 configuration, with\nI\u03c0 \u2248 12\u2212, becomes energetically favored, as shown in Fig. 1.\nFurther details are given in Table I, and a schematic illustration\nof the competing prolate and oblate shapes is shown in Fig. 2.\nFor oblate shape, the Fermi level is amongst the low-\u0007\n\u03c0h11\/2 and \u03bdi13\/2 orbitals, and they undergo Coriolis-induced\nrotation alignment. Note that the TRS diagram in Fig. 1\nfor 190Re shows a triaxial shape, but this becomes oblate\nat higher frequency (\u03b3 = \u221272\u25e6 for h\u00af\u03c9 = 0.2 MeV). Also,\nfor 188Ta, the oblate minimum becomes yrast for h\u00af\u03c9 >\n0.1 MeV. Moreover, in all four cases, oblate shapes dominate\nthe high-spin behavior. It should be appreciated, however,\nthat the oblate band heads are not well defined in the TRS\ncalculations. This is due to the rotation alignment effects,\nwith the calculations being performed in a frequency basis,\nrather than an angular-momentum basis. Full \u03c0h11\/2 \u2297 \u03bdi13\/2\nalignment gives I = 12, but I = 10 band heads are also\npossible, i.e., with incomplete alignment, and this would be\ncompatible with the oblate angular momenta at h\u00af\u03c9 = 0.1 MeV,\nas given in Table I.

In the present\nwork, the focus is on the prolate\u2014oblate competition in\n188,190Ta and 190,192Re, where triaxiality plays a relatively\nminor role.\nAccording to the calculations, the rotation alignment of\none proton and one neutron is sufficient to enable the oblate\nshape to become yrast, and additional alignments at higher\nrotational frequency maintain the oblate yrast status. It seems,\ntherefore, that these odd-odd nuclides are very favourable for\nexperimental investigation of the oblate-rotor behavior. While\nthese are neutron-rich nuclides, making them difficult to access\nexperimentally, advances with radioactive-beam facilities may\nsoon open up the possibilities. It is notable, for example, that an\nI\u03c0 = (6\u2212) isomer is already known in 190Re [18], and isomeric\ndecays have recently been identified in 188Ta and 192Re [19]\nusing the projectile-fragmentation technique with delayed\nTABLE I.

Half-lives of, respectively, 5 and 120\u00b5s were\nfound. However, there is insufficient information to associate\nthese isomers with the predicted prolate-oblate coexistence,\nand further data are needed. A key observation would be\nthe rotational bands built on the different shapes, since these\nare expected to be in the form of strongly coupled \bI = 1\nsequences for high-K prolate shapes, and rotation-aligned\n\bI = 2 sequences for oblate shapes.\nThe N = 117 and 119 iridium isotopes, 192,194Ir, are close\nto stability (193Ir is stable) and easier to access experimentally.\nIt is interesting to note that high-spin isomers are known\nin these isotopes [18]: I\u03c0 = (11\u2212), T1\/2 = 241 years, E =\n168 keV in 192Ir; and (10\u2212, 11\u2212), 171 days, 370 keV in 194Ir. A\nsimilar (11)\u2212 isomer is also known in 190Ir [18]. Indeed, Jain\net al. [20] specifically mention the possibility of prolate-oblate\nshape coexistence in the vicinity of 192Ir. However, in view of\nthe predicted triaxiality of the iridium isotopes (see above) it\nis likely that their eventual interpretation will be complex.\nIn summary, TRS calculations show that oblate shape is\ninduced in the odd-odd nuclides 188,190Ta and 190,192Re by the\nrotation alignment of the \u03c0h11\/2 \u2297 \u03bdi13\/2 pair of nucleons,\nE\nI (I + 1)\nprolate\noblate\nFIG. 2.
