Mattock.Infants\u2019 Tone Perception  38 Footnotes 1 The project was moved to Sydney, Australia due to SARS in Hong Kong and recruiting difficulties. 2 Interestingly factor analysis revealed that Chinese parents\u2019 questionnaire responses loaded onto a single factor, 'total language use' (explaining 69.67% of response variance). In a regression analysis this factor did not predict infants' speech or non-speech tone discrimination. Thus Chinese infants' equivalent tone discrimination in speech at 6 and 9 months is not related to degree of tone language experience, but rather to tone language experience per se. 3 We do not suspect any gender differences in discrimination performance. Lexical tone discrimination was compared across gender in Experiment 2a  (where the number of boys versus girls is more balanced). No performance advantage for either group, t (46) = -1.699, p = .096 was found. 4 Only infants reported by the parent to be Cantonese-only or Mandarin-only were included in the statistical analysis. Infants exposed to Cantonese and Mandarin, or English and one of the Chinese languages were not included in the analysis.

Very young infants can discriminate a wide \nrange of native and nonnative consonants and vowels, and then in a process of perceptual \nreorganization over the first year, discrimination of most nonnative speech sounds deteriorates. \nWe investigated perceptual reorganization for tones by testing 6- and 9-month-old infants from \ntone (Chinese) and non-tone (English) language environments for speech (lexical tone) and non-\nspeech (violin sound) tone discrimination in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. \nOverall, Chinese infants performed equally well at 6 and 9 months for both speech and non-\nspeech tone discrimination. Conversely, English infants\u2019 discrimination of lexical tone declined \nbetween 6 and 9 months of age, while their non-speech tone discrimination remained constant. \nThese results indicate that the reorganization of tone perception is a function of the native \nlanguage environment, and that this reorganization is linguistically based.   \n \nWord count (abstract): 155 \nInfants\u2019 Tone Perception 3\n \nChinese and English Infants\u2019 Tone Perception: Evidence for Perceptual Reorganization  \nInfants in their first months after birth discriminate a wide range of speech contrasts, both \nnative and nonnative. A process of perceptual reorganization takes place over the first year, such \nthat discrimination of most nonnative speech sounds deteriorates (Best, McRoberts, & Sithole, \n1988; Werker, Gilbert, Humphrey, & Tees, 1981; Werker & Tees, 1983; 1984). This \nreorganization is language specific. For example, between 10 and 12 months English-learning \ninfants\u2019 perceptual discrimination of nonnative Hindi and Salish consonant contrasts is \nattenuated (Werker et al., 1981; Werker & Tees, 1983; 1984), whereas Hindi- and Salish-\nlearning infants show no such attenuation over age for the same (for them, native) contrasts \n(Werker & Tees, 1984). This perceptual reorganization also occurs for vowels, though \nattenuation for nonnative vowels appears to begin earlier - around 6 to 8 months (Kuhl, \nWilliams, Lacerda, & Stevens, 1992; Polka & Werker, 1994).  It has been proposed that the \nperceptual reorganization is due to attentional or cognitive factors rather than sensorineural loss, \nas adults can discriminate nonnative consonant contrasts under certain conditions - when the \ninter-stimulus interval is short (Werker & Logan, 1985), or when extensive training is given \n(Tees & Werker, 1984). \nMore than 70% of the world\u2019s languages are tone languages (Yip, 2002) and over half the \nworld\u2019s population speak a tone language (Fromkin, 1978) yet infant speech perception research \nhas typically focused on consonants and vowels. In tone languages (e.g., those of Asia, Central \nAmerica and West Africa \u2013 e.g., Thai, Mixtec, and Yoruba), over and above vowel and \nconsonant variations, words are distinguished by lexical tone.  Tone consists primarily of \nvariations in the level and\/or contour of the fundamental frequency (F0) of syllables (Gandour & \nInfants\u2019 Tone Perception 4\nHarshman, 1978) perceived by the listener as pitch. Thai, for example, has five lexical tones, \nthree level tones, low, mid, and high, and two contour tones, rising and falling (Abramson, \n1962). Time-normalized fundamental frequency (F0) plots of these on the syllable \/kha\/ are \npresented in Figure 1. Other acoustic features also figure in tone distinctions - physical duration, \nthe second formant, F2 (perceived vowel backness, e.g., \/i\/ to \/u\/), voice quality (perceived as \nvowel quality), and amplitude (perceived as loudness) (Abramson, 1978; Henderson, 1981; \nTseng, Massaro, & Cohen, 1985). Tone is unique because it can be considered to be both a \nsegmental and suprasegmental feature of speech. From a functional perspective, tones can be \nconsidered to be segments, for a change in tone within a word results in a change of meaning, \njust as a change of a consonant or vowel does. However, from a structural perspective tones can \nbe considered to be suprasegmental because they are carried upon vowels, and tones extend \nacross at least one syllable in tone languages.  Given the widespread use of tone in the world\u2019s \nlanguages (Fromkin, 1978; Yip, 2002) the study of tone is important, yet most developmental \nstudies of speech perception have investigated infants learning Indo-European languages \n(Clumeck, 1980), and have focused on consonant and vowel perception. There is no \ncomprehensive account of tone perception during the infancy period.  \nCross-linguistic influences on lexical tone perception have been frequently reported both \nin behavioral and brain-imaging studies. Burnham et al. (1996) tested non-tone (English), tone \n(Thai, Cantonese), and pitch-accent (Swedish) language speaking adults\u2019 and Thai and English \nspeaking childrens\u2019 discrimination of Thai tones in three contexts - speech, filtered speech, and \nviolin sounds.  English-speaking children and adults discriminated tone contrasts in the two non-\nspeech contexts, musical and low-pass filtered speech, better than the same F0 variations \npresented as speech (lexical tone), whereas the tone or pitch-accent language speaking adults and \nInfants\u2019 Tone Perception 5\nchildren performed equally well in all three contexts.  These results point to English speakers\u2019 \ndifficulty in discriminating linguistic but not non-linguistic tone distinctions, an effect that has \nbeen shown by Gandour, Wong, and Hutchins (1998) to reflect differences in neural activation. \nGandour and colleagues found that Thai speakers\u2019 discrimination of lexical tone activated left \nhemisphere language regions because lexical tone is phonologically significant in the Thai \nlanguage. However, such activation was not observed for Thai listeners presented with non-\nlinguistic pitch variations nor was it for English listeners\u2019 discrimination of either non-linguistic \npitch or lexical tone. \nIt has been suggested that perceptual reorganization on the basis of ambient language \ncharacteristics occurs not only for segments (consonants and vowels) but also for the \nsuprasegmental features of the language, namely prosody (Hirsh-Pasek et al., 1987), and the \nstress patterns of words (Jusczyk, Cutler, & Redanz, 1993; Jusczyk, Friederici, Wessels, \nSvenkerud, & Jusczyk, 1993; Jusczyk & Kemler Nelson, 1996). While there is, as yet, no similar \nbody of evidence regarding lexical tone, Cutler and Mehler (1993) suggest that infants have a \nperiodicity bias to attend to the smallest level of rhythmic regularity in the ambient language. If \nthis is so, infants should discover whether and how intonation, rhythm, stress, and also tone are \nused in the ambient language environment, and attend to the relevant regularities and ignore \nirrelevant variation. Thus infant learners of a tone language should attend to lexical tone, while \ninfants from non-tone language environments should attend less to tone, especially as a product \nof increasing familiarity with the ambient phonology.  \nThe question of whether perceptual reorganization occurs in infancy for tone as well as \nfor consonants and vowels is especially interesting given infants\u2019 early sensitivity to and \npreference for the speech style naturally used by adults talking to infants \u2013 the highly pitch-\nInfants\u2019 Tone Perception 6\nmodulated infant-directed speech (IDS; Burnham, Kitamura, & Vollmer-Conna, 2002; Cooper & \nAslin, 1990). Granted, the use of F0 is different in these two realms: In IDS F0 is involved in \nrhythm and intonation across utterances and is a means to pragmatic and emotional, not \nspecifically lexical, ends (Ramus, Nespor, & Mehler, 1999), whereas tone involves F0 \nmovement on a single syllable and distinguishes lexical items (Gandour, Potisuk, Dechongkit, & \nPonglorpisit, 1992). Nonetheless, infants have been shown to discriminate the vowels \/i\/, as in \n\u2018beet\u2019, and \/I\/, as in \u2018bit\u2019, more easily with, than without, IDS pitch contours (Trainor & \nDesjardins, 2002), as well as demonstrating discrimination of two words whose final vowels \ndiffer in F0 contour (Karzon & Nicholas, 1989). These facilitative effects of IDS suprasegmental \ninformation on speech perception together with the finding of infants\u2019 preference for IDS over \nADS (Fernald & Kuhl, 1987) show that young infants are particularly sensitive to pitch \ncharacteristics of speech (Cooper & Aslin, 1990; Fernald, 1985; Werker & McLeod, 1989).  \nGiven this sensitivity to pitch in IDS, is it possible that perceptual reorganization for tone may \nfollow a different path than that for consonants and vowels?  \nIn tone languages, such as Mandarin and Thai, heightened F0 and larger F0 range occur \nin IDS compared to ADS (Grieser & Kuhl, 1988; Kitamura, Thanavisuth, Burnham, & \nLuksaneeyanawin, 2002 ) . So, it is possible that the perceptual salience of pitch in IDS might \noverride perceptual reorganization for tone \u2013 that is, tone language infants\u2019 perceptual attention \nto tones might be compromised or delayed by significant F0 fluctuations in IDS that are \nunrelated to tone. However, evidence suggests this is not the case, as ratings of the integrity of \nlexical tone information in Thai by Thai phonologists has shown that tones are relatively \nidentifiable in Thai IDS, although less identifiable than tones in ADS utterances (Kitamura et al., \n2002).  This is consistent with research showing that Thai tones retain their integrity over \nInfants\u2019 Tone Perception 7\nintonational modulation (Abramson & Svastikula, 1983; Luksaneeyanawin, 1984). Thus it is \nlikely that tone perception may not be affected by the intonation of IDS, and it can be speculated \nthat perceptual reorganization for tone may follow a similar path to that for consonants and \nvowels. \nThere are a number of additional issues regarding the perception of tones by infants \nwhich require discussion: whether infants\u2019 pitch discrimination ability is commensurate with the \nF0 variations present in lexical tone contrasts; whether they categorize speech sounds on the \nbasis of tone; and whether there is perceptual reorganization for tone. That infants discriminate \non the basis of F0 is evident from studies of pitch in speech reported above, such as that by \nTrainor and Desjardins (2002). That they also discriminate on the basis of tone-like F0 changes \nis evident in a study of pitch-accent in which it was found that French newborn infants \ndiscriminate two lists of Japanese bisyllabic words differing only on pitch-accent (ascending vs. \ndescending) (Nazzi, Floccia & Bertoncini, 1998). As pitch-accent is a special instance of tone \n(involving the relative pitch and stress of two adjacent syllables) it appears that newborns are \nsensitive to tone categories in a language-general manner from birth. Nevertheless, as pitch-\naccent is, by definition, carried on two syllables, and as only a single study has been conducted, \nfurther experiments are required before such a conclusion can be drawn with confidence, and \ngeneralized across tone types.  \nWith respect to the perceptual organization for tone, there is but a single published study \nof infants\u2019 lexical tone perception. Harrison (2000) found that 6- to 8-month-old Yoruba (tone \nlanguage) infants discriminated between different Yoruba tone categories better than did English \nlanguage infants (Harrison, 2000), but the issue of perceptual reorganization for tone over age \nwas not addressed.  \nInfants\u2019 Tone Perception 8\nBuilding both on this study of tone perception and studies of infant consonant (Best et al., \n1988; Werker et al., 1981; Werker & Tees, 1983; 1984) and vowel (Kuhl et al., 1992; Polka & \nWerker, 1994) perception, we investigated perceptual reorganization for tone across (a) age \n(from 6 to 9 months), (b) language environments (Chinese and English), and (c) acoustic \ncontexts (speech and non-speech) in two sets of studies \u2013 one using a cross-sectional design, and \nthe other a longitudinal design. \nFour experiments are reported, two cross-sectional, and two longitudinal. To investigate \nperceptual reorganization we tested 6- and 9-month-old infants for their perceptual \ndiscrimination of Thai tones, with the expectation that 6-month-olds would exhibit language-\ngeneral speech perception abilities and 9-month-olds, native-language perception. To examine \nlanguage environment, English language infants, for whom tone contrasts are phonologically \nirrelevant, and Chinese (Cantonese and Mandarin) language infants, for whom tones are \nphonologically relevant (six and four tones respectively), were tested.  \n As Thai tone contrasts were used, infants in both the tone (Cantonese and Mandarin) and \nnon-tone (English) language groups were presented with nonnative speech contrasts. Naturally, \nthe tone systems of Thai, Cantonese, and Mandarin are different, but there are some similarities \nbetween them. Like Thai (see Figure 1), Cantonese and Mandarin have both level tones, and \ncontour, rising and falling, tones. Cantonese has a high rise tone with a rising F0 contour, a low \nfall tone with a falling F0 contour, and a low level tone with a relatively stable F0 (So, 1996). \nMandarin includes a level tone, a mid-rising contour tone, and a high falling contour tone (Xu, \n1999). So Thai, Cantonese, and Mandarin are similar in the type of tones they contain. \nNevertheless, there are differences between the tone systems, particularly in relation to F0 \nstarting and endpoints, pitch height, pitch length, and voicing. Thus the Cantonese and Mandarin \nInfants\u2019 Tone Perception 9\ntone language infants here would be expected to have had exposure to phonologically-relevant  \ndifferences between  level and contour  tones and between types of contour tones, rising and \nfalling, and, as will be seen below, such tone contrasts were incorporated in the Thai test stimuli \nused here.. Given that language familiarity was controlled in this study, any differences in \ndiscrimination ability between the Chinese and English groups were expected to be due to the \npresence and absence respectively of lexical tone per se in the infants\u2019 language rather than \nwhether the language was native or not. \nThe two contrasts on which infants were tested were the Thai rising vs. falling tone \ncontrast and the Thai rising vs. low tone contrast, labelled Contour-Contour and Level-Contour \nrespectively on the basis of the F0 trajectory of the tones composing each pair (see Figure 1). \nThese pairs of tones were selected to sample the range of possible F0 contrasts in Thai. The F0 \ntrajectories of the rising and falling (Contour-Contour contrast) tones are vastly different, \nwhereas the F0 trajectories of the rising and low (Level-Contour contrast) tones show some \noverlap until approximately the mid-point of the tone, before they diverge. As set out above, \nthese tone contrasts, rising Contour vs. falling Contour and Level vs. Contour were classes of \ntone contrasts that Chinese infants would be familiar with, while not being familiar with the \nactual relativities of the particular tones.     \nFinally, to determine whether any perceptual reorganization for tone is a function of \nexperience with the specific phonological, or of the more general acoustic environment, we \ntested infants on the Thai tone contrasts in two distinct contexts. Infants were tested for \ndiscrimination performance of these contrasts in (a) natural speech, (i.e., tones carried on the \nsyllable [ba]), and (b) non-speech with identical F0 contours as the Thai tones in speech (i.e., F0 \ncarried on a violin-like sound).  \nInfants\u2019 Tone Perception 10\nIf the age parameters of perceptual reorganization apply to tone as they do to consonants, \nthen it would be expected that 6-month-olds should show language-general and 9-month-olds \nlanguage-specific tone perception. More specifically there should be a decrement between 6 and \n9 months in discrimination ability for tones in speech (i.e., lexical tone) for English language \ninfants, but no such decrement over age for Chinese language infants. With respect to the \nspeech\/non-speech issue, while infants of 7 and 9 months discriminate and categorize musical \ntone sequences on the basis of pitch contour (Trehub, Bull, & Thorpe, 1984), it has been argued \nthat unless they are being raised in a tone language environment, it is not advantageous for them \nalso to attend to subtle pitch differences in a linguistic task (Saffran & Griepentrog, 2001).  \nIndeed, inferior tone discrimination by non-tone versus tone language adults is specific to \nspeech: their discrimination improves dramatically when F0 differences are presented in non-\nlinguistic contexts (filtered speech, violin sounds) (Burnham et al., 1996).  The same is expected \nhere: while there should be a decrement between 6 and 9 months in discrimination ability for \ntones in speech for English, but not Chinese language infants, there should be no 6 to 9 month \ndecrement in discrimination ability for non-speech tones for either language group.   \nGENERAL METHOD \nDesign \nEach experiment employed a 2 x 2 design with Age (6 months, 9 months) and Contrast \n(Contour-Contour, Level-Contour contrast) as factors. Infants were randomly assigned to one of \ntwo discrimination conditions in each experiment \u2013 Contour-Contour tone contrast or Level-\nContour tone contrast. Allocation of background and target stimuli was counterbalanced across \nparticipants for each tone pair. The percentage of correct responses (hits plus correct rejections \ndivided by the number of trials) was the dependent variable. \nInfants\u2019 Tone Perception 11\n \n \nParticipants \nEnglish-learning and Chinese-learning infants were recruited from families residing in \nSydney, Australia1. The English-learning infants were eligible for participation if they were \nbeing raised in a monolingual English-speaking family. Chinese infants were eligible for \nparticipation if one or both parents were native Cantonese or Mandarin speakers, and if at least \none of these languages was used by the parent when interacting with their infant. Participating \ninfants were born between 38 and 42 weeks gestation, and had no documented history of ear \ninfection. Parents received remuneration of $20 AUD for travel expenses, and a selection of baby \nproducts. Infants received a Young Scientist award and t-shirt. \nStimuli \nThe lexical tone contrasts were a Contour-Contour contrast ba& vs ba^. (ba-rising vs. ba-\nfalling) and a Level-Contour contrast,  ba& vs. ba$ (ba-rising vs. ba-low) The non-speech contrasts, \nrising vs. falling and rising vs. low, were analogues of these. The lexical tones were spoken by a \nfemale native speaker of Thai and the contrasts were previously used for a study by Burnham \nand Francis (1997) on adults\u2019 tone discrimination.  Five exemplars of each tone were recorded in \nadult-directed speech. The exemplars were confirmed to be physically similar using the \nSTRAIGHT (Speech Transformation & Representation using Adaptive Interpolation of \nweiGHTed spectrogram; Kawahara, Katayose, de Chevigne, & Patterson, 1999) program on the \nbasis of F0 height, contour, and amplitude, and were segmented into individual sound files using \nCool Edit 1996. Stimulus duration ranged from 621ms to 741ms for [ba&] (M = 671.4, SD = \n49.813), 627ms to 751ms for ba^ (M = 667.2, SD = 48.376) and 601ms to 695ms for [ba$] \uf020(M = \n648.4, SD = 39.564). The non-speech contrasts were created from pitch (F0) tracks of the lexical \nInfants\u2019 Tone Perception 12\ntone exemplars using STRAIGHT (Kawahara et al., 1999) that were resynthesized onto a \nkeyboard-generated violin template (the A below middle C, i.e., 220 Hz, recorded onto disk from \na Roland Digital Intelligent Piano, KF-90) using the Auditory Perception Toolbox (Haszard \nMorris, Stainsby, Malloch, & Burnham, 2002). Lexical tone and non-speech tone stimuli are \nlocated online at http:\/\/www.infancyarchives.com. \nProcedure \nInfants were tested using a single experimenter version of the conditioned head-turn procedure \n(The Exeter Hayes & Slater Conditioned Head-turn Program, version 2). The experimenter \n(listening to jumbled stimuli and music through headphones) engaged the infant with toys, \ninitiated trials when gaze was centred, and recorded head-turns. In the training stage, infants \nwere presented with one stimulus of a pair, the background sound (e.g., [ba&]), played \ncontinuously at intervals of 1000ms, and were conditioned to turn their heads towards a visual \nreinforcer when there was a change from the background to a target sound (e.g., [ba$]) with \nbackground-target identity counterbalanced between infants. In the training stage the reinforcer \nwas automatically activated to a background to target sound change but a delay between stimulus \nchange and reinforcement activation was gradually introduced to encourage head-turns to \nstimulus changes.  In the test stage infants were presented with both change and no-change \n(control) trials, with return to retraining for infants who failed to produce a head turn on three \nconsecutive change trials. Correct head-turns (hits) were rewarded by presentation of a visual \nreinforcer (dancing toy monkeys playing drums).  Incorrect head-turns (false positives) were not \nrewarded. Infants progressed from the training to the test stage following three consecutive head-\nturns on change trials. There was a 75% probability that any given trial would be a change trial \nwith the constraint that no more than three change or three no-change control trials were \nInfants\u2019 Tone Perception 13\npresented consecutively. Selection of change and control trials was computer controlled. Test \ntrials continued until infants reached criterion (7 correct responses within 8 consecutive trials) or \nuntil 25 test trials were presented, whichever occurred earlier. Infants\u2019 percent correct responses \non test trials was the variable used to measure performance.  This procedure was used for all \nexperiments reported here. \nThe parents of Chinese infants completed a questionnaire regarding their tone language \nuse.  The questionnaire was designed to assess the total proportion of time that the Chinese \ninfants were exposed to a tone language relative to a non-tone language - an important \nconsideration given that the infants are being raised in Australia where the official language is \nEnglish. Fifty-five percent of respondents were native Cantonese speakers, 42% were native \nMandarin speakers, and 3% were native Cantonese-Mandarin bilinguals. Parents were asked to \nreport biographical details, and answer questions about their predominant language use, \npreferred language (if more than one), language proficiency, and language input to their infant. \nResponses to each question were coded as 0 = predominately Chinese influence to 1 = \npredominately English influence. These 0\/1 scores were then totaled to yield a proportion of \nEnglish use score. All respondents were asked to indicate the overall percentage of language \ninput to their infant that is Chinese, compared to the percentage of English language input. Mean \nlanguage input for infants was 62% Chinese and 38% English 2. \nTHE CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDIES \nExperiment 1a: Chinese-learning Infants\u2019 Discrimination of Lexical Tone \nParticipants \nThe participants were 48 infants, 24 (8 boys, 16 girls3) 6-month-olds (M = 6.08; Range = \n5.61-6.85, SD = .277) and 24 (11 boys, 13 girls) 9-month-olds (M = 9.103; Range = 8.459-9.57, \nInfants\u2019 Tone Perception 14\nSD = .206) from Chinese families, who were recruited via public announcements. Eight \nadditional infants were tested, but were rejected from the final sample on the grounds of crying \n(5) and fussiness (3). Forty-five of the infants were tested at the University of Western Sydney \nand three infants were tested at the University of Hong Kong.  \nResults and Discussion \nPercent correct (hits + correct rejections) was computed for every infant. There was no \nevidence of differences due to which tone of each tone pair was the background stimulus for \neither the Contour-Contour, t(22) = .843, p = .408 (ba & vs. ba^, M = 59.34% correct, SD = 13.11; \nba^ vs. ba&, M = 55.53% correct, SD = 6.553) or Level-Contour, t(22) = .735, p = .470 (ba& vs. \nba$, M = 56.02% correct, SD = 14.21; ba$ vs. ba&, M = 61.24, SD = 20.09) contrasts, and \ndiscrimination by infants with a background of exposure to Cantonese (M = 60.16, SD = 13.29) \nversus Mandarin (M = 55.61, SD = 12.21) did not differ significantly t(35) = 1.023, p = .314)4. \nMean percent correct for the Contour-Contour and Level-Contour contrasts is plotted for each \nage group in Figure 2, panel 1a.  A 2 (Age) x 2 (Contrast) ANOVA showed no significant \ndifferences between performance of 6-month-olds (M = 59.64%, SD = 11.46) and of 9-month-\nolds (M = 56.74%, SD = 16.7), F(1,44) = .277, p = .601, \u014b2  = .006, nor between discrimination \nof the Contour-Contour (M = 57.75%, SD = 10.84) and Level-Contour (M = 58.63%, SD = \n17.23) lexical tone contrasts F(1,44) = .002, p = .960, \u014b2 = .000, and no interaction F(1,44) = \n.042, p = .838, \u014b2 = .001.  Moreover, discrimination was above chance for both the 6-month-old, \nt (23) = 3.771, p = .001, and the 9-month-old infants, t(23) = 2.146, p =. 043, further confirming \nthat tone discrimination performance did not change over age.  \nOverall, the pattern of results for Chinese- learning infants\u2019 discrimination of lexical tone \n\u2013 equivalent performance at 6 and 9 months on both the Contour-Contour [ba&] vs. [ba^] and \nInfants\u2019 Tone Perception 15\nLevel-Contour [ba&] vs. [ba$] contrasts - provides evidence that Chinese-learning infants\u2019 \nperceptual discrimination of the lexical tone contrasts is maintained across age.  \n \nExperiment 1b: Chinese-Learning Infants\u2019 Discrimination of Non-speech Tone \nParticipants \nForty Chinese-learning infants, 20 6-month-olds (8 boys, 12 girls) and 20 9- month-olds \n(8 boys, 12 girls) participated in the study. The mean age of 6-month-olds was 6.12 months \n(Range = 5.84-6.85, SD = .25,) and the mean age of 9 month-olds was 9.04 months (Range = \n8.53-9.77, SD = .22). An additional six infants were tested but excluded from analyses due to \ncrying (2), fussiness (3) or because they fell asleep during the testing session (1). Due to \ndifficulties recruiting infants, the participants for this experiment were also the same participants \nas in Experiment 1a. Order of participation in the lexical tone and non-speech tone \ndiscrimination experiments was counterbalanced across subjects, and testing for each experiment \ntook place on separate days, within one week of each other. \nResults and Discussion \nTwo independent samples t-tests were performed on percent correct scores to rule out the \neffect of background stimulus. No such effects were found for the Contour-Contour contrast \nt(18) = 1.206, p = .243 (rising vs. falling, M = 67.53% correct, SD = 16.40; falling vs. rising, M = \n59.47%, SD = 13.34) or the Level-Contour contrast t(18) = .810, p = .429 (rising vs. low, M = \n57.48%, SD =15.53; low vs. rising, M = 52.13%, SD = 12.12) . To check for order of \nparticipation effects for participation in Experiments 1a and 1b, and practice effects across the \ntwo days of testing, a 2 Order (Order 1:lexical tone-non-speech tone, Order 2:non-speech tone-\nlexical tone) x 2 Day (Day 1, Day 2) mixed plot repeated measures ANOVA was performed on \npercent correct data. There were no significant differences between discrimination as a function \nInfants\u2019 Tone Perception 16\nof order of task completion (MOrder1= 60.8, SD = 13.20; MOrder2 = 57.4, SD = 15.71; F (1,38) = \n1.203, p = .280), and day of testing (MDay1 = 62.70; SD = 16.98; MDay2 = 56.42, SD = 11.44; F (1, \n38) = 3.152, p = .084), and no order x day interaction, F (1, 38) = .157, p = .694).   \nPercent correct scores for all infants were entered into a 2 x 2 ANOVA with Age and \nContrast as factors. The mean percent correct for 6- and 9-month-old infants in the Contour-\nContour and Level-Contour conditions are shown in Figure 2, panel 1b. Mean percent correct \ndiscrimination for 6-month-olds was 55.4% (SD = 12.42) and 62.9% for 9-month-olds (SD = \n16.75), and this difference was not significant, F (1,38) = 2.598, p = .116, \u014b2 = .067. There was \nalso no significant difference between performance in the Contour-Contour (M = 62.9%, SD \n=15.66) and Level-Contour (M = 55.3%, SD = 13.71%) conditions, F (1,38) = 2.736, p = .107, \u014b2 \n= .071, and no interaction, F (1,38) = .105, p = .748, \u014b2 = .003. T-tests against chance indicated \nperformance was not significantly different from chance for the 6-month-olds, t (19) = 1.931, p = \n.069, but was above chance for 9-month-olds, t (20) = 3.416, p = .003, suggesting perhaps more \nreliable responding at 9 than 6 months, and perhaps an overall improvement with age for non-\nspeech discrimination. \nIn order to evaluate relative performance in Experiments 1a (lexical tone) and 1b (non-\nspeech tone), we compared percent correct (Figure 3, panel a). A 2 Age (6 months, 9 months) x 2 \nTask (Lexical, Non-speech) ANOVA failed to reveal significant effects of age (F (1,84) = .289, \np = .686), task (F (1,84) = .064, p = .842), or an age by task interaction (F (1,84) = 2.407, p = \n.125). \nThe results of this experiment show that for Chinese-learning infants there is no change in \ndiscrimination performance over age for non-speech tone, though note that the t-tests against \nchance suggest more reliable responding at 9 than 6 months. In addition, Chinese infants \nInfants\u2019 Tone Perception 17\nperformed equivalently on lexical tones and on non-speech tones, and there was no change in \nperformance level over age for either.  \nExperiment 2a: English-Learning Infants\u2019 Discrimination of Lexical Tone \nParticipants  \nThe participants were 48 infants, 24 6-month-olds (14 girls, 10 boys; M = 6.25 months; \nRange = 6.03-6.63 months, SD = .0167) and 24 9-month-olds (13 boys, 11 girls; M = 9.17 \nmonths; Range = 8.89-9.51 months, SD = .1710). An additional 24 infants were tested, but were \nnot included in the final sample due to crying (2) or fussiness (3), experimenter error (12), lack of \nresponsiveness to the reinforcer (2), and failure to meet the language background requirements \n(5). \nResults and Discussion \n \nThere were no differences in percent correct discrimination due to which tone was the \nbackground stimulus in either the Contour-Contour t(22) = 1.102, p = .282 (ba& vs. ba^, M = \n69.75% correct, SD = 16.24; ba^ vs. ba& M = 62.08% correct; SD =17.8) or the Level-Contour \ncondition t(22) = .265, p = .794 (ba& vs. ba$, M = 51% correct, SD = 14.08; ba$ vs. ba&, M = 49.75%, \nSD = .8.35), so the data were pooled. A 2 (Age) x 2 (Contrast) between subjects ANOVA was \nemployed to compare the percent correct discrimination by 6- month-olds and 9-month-olds to \nthe [ba& vs. [ba^] (Contour-Contour) and [ba&] v [ba$] (Level-Contour) contrasts. Mean performance \nby age group is shown in Figure 2, panel 2a. A main effect for Age (F (1,44) = 6.792, p = .012, \n\u014b2 = .134) was found in which 6-month-olds (M6months = 63.27%, SD = 17.70) showed reliably \nbetter discrimination than 9-month-olds (M9months = 52.96%, SD =13.18). There was a significant \neffect of Contrast, with better discrimination of the Contour-Contour (M = 65.86%, SD = 17.01) \nthan the Level-Contour contrast (M = 50.37%, SD = 11.29), F(1,44) = 15.361, p = .001, \u014b2 = \nInfants\u2019 Tone Perception 18\n.258, but no Age x Contrast interaction, F(1,44) = .320, p = .574, \u014b2  = .008. Tests against chance \nrevealed discrimination significantly above chance for 6-month-olds, t (23) = 3.669, p = .001, but \nnot significantly above chance for 9-month-olds t (23) = 1.098, p = .284), showing that the \nattenuation of discrimination performance over age for English-learning infants is not just a \nmatter of degree \u2013 it ceases to be significant at the older age. \nThe results show that English-learning 6-month-olds discriminated the lexical tone contrasts \nbetter than their 9-month-old counterparts, with superior discrimination of the Contour-Contour \ncompared to the Level-Contour contrast. Both 6- and 9- month-old infants discriminated the \nContour-Contour contrast, [ba&] vs. [ba]^, but the vast majority of infants in both age groups had \npoorer discrimination for the Level-Contour [ba&] and [ba$], suggesting that for them these speech \nsounds were perceptually similar. \nExperiment 2b: English-Learning Infants\u2019 Discrimination of Non-speech Tone \nParticipants \nThe participants were 24 6-month-olds (14 boys, 10 girls) and 24 9-month-olds (8 boys, \n16 girls). Mean age of the younger infants was 6.25 months (Range 6.00-6.82, SD = .1944,) and \nmean age of the older infants was 9.22 months (Range 8.98-9.48, SD = .1564 months). An \nadditional eight infants were tested but excluded from analyses due to crying (2), fussiness (4), \nparental interference (1), or because they fell asleep during the testing session (1). \nResults and Discussion \nPercent correct discrimination was calculated for each infant\u2019s performance. Overall, no \nstatistical difference was found regarding which non-speech tone in a pair was presented as the \nbackground sound for either the Contour-Contour, t (22) = 9.49, p = .353 (rising vs. falling, M = \n66.74% correct, SD = 8.547; falling vs. rising M = 71.84% correct, SD =16.55), or Level-\nInfants\u2019 Tone Perception 19\nContour contrast t(22) = .922, p = .902 (rising vs. low, M = 63.35% correct, SD = 15.23; low vs. \nrising, M = 62.61% correct, SD = 13.79). Therefore data were collapsed across this factor. Mean \npercent correct scores are shown in Figure 2, panel 2b. A 2 Age (6-month-olds, 9-month-olds) x \n2 Contrast (Contour-Contour, Level-Contour) between-subjects ANOVA yielded no main effects \nindicating no significant difference in performance for 6-month-olds versus 9-month-olds (F \n(1,46) = 3.918, p = .054, \u014b2 = .084; M6months = 62.5%, SD = 14.80, M9months = 69.8%, SD = 12.20), \nor for the Contour-Contour  (M= 69.3%, SD =13.140) versus Level-Contour contrast (F (1, 46) = \n2.933, p = .094, \u014b2 = .063; M = 63%, SD = 14.22). However, an Age x Contrast interaction \n(F(1,46) = 4.944, p = .031, \u014b2 = .102) was revealed; 6-month-olds showed superior \ndiscrimination for the Contour-Contour over the Level-Contour contrast while for 9 month-olds \nthere was very little difference. Performance was above chance for both the 6- month-old, t (23) \n= 4.121, p = .001, and 9-month-old, t (23) = 7.963, p = .001 infants, indicating no change in \ndiscrimination over age for the non-speech tone contrasts.  \nPerformance on the lexical tone (Experiment 2a) and non-speech tone (Experiment 2b) \nexperiments was compared using an Age (6 months, 9 months) x Task (Lexical, Non-speech) \nANOVA with percent correct as the dependent variable. As shown in Figure 3 (panel b) there \nwas no main effect of age (F(1,92) = .244, p = .622), but there was a significant main effect of \ntask (F(1,92) = 7.180, p = .009), and a significant Age x Task interaction (F(1,92) = 8.832, p = \n.004). These results with English-learning infants highlight an age-related decline in \ndiscrimination ability specifically for lexical tone, as there was equivalent discrimination of \nlexical tone and non-speech tone by 6-month-olds; a significant decline in lexical but not non-\nspeech tone discrimination from 6 to 9 months; and superior discrimination of non-speech tone \nversus lexical tone contrasts by 9-month-old infants. \nInfants\u2019 Tone Perception 20\nTHE LONGITUDINAL STUDIES \nThe results of the cross-sectional studies suggest that lexical tone perception is shaped by \nexposure to and experience with speech sounds in a lexical tone language. Specifically, data \nfrom the English-learning infants (Experiment 2) show that initial perceptual abilities appear to \nshift from being language-general towards a more constrained, language-specific pattern. \nWithout lexical tone in their speech input, there appears to be attenuation of 9-month-old \nEnglish-learning infants\u2019 discrimination of lexical tone distinctions. A different pattern emerged \nfor the Chinese-learning infants whose speech input contains lexical tones \u2013 in Experiment 1a \ntheir perceptual performance appears to be maintained presumably due to their regular exposure \nto and experience with a lexical tone language.  \nThese cross-sectional data provide support for the notion of perceptual reorganization for \ntone in infancy. However, they do not provide evidence regarding individual development. \nLongitudinal studies, unlike cross-sectional studies, measure and compare changes in \nindividual\u2019s behavior over time. Thus the longitudinal design is likely to indicate more clearly \nwhether an individual infant\u2019s ability to discriminate lexical tone contrasts is influenced by age \nand linguistic experience. The next set of experiments are longitudinal adaptations of the lexical \ntone and non-speech tone discrimination experiments with English -learning and Chinese -\nlearning infants tested at 6 months, and again at 9 months of age. It is expected that the results of \nthe longitudinal studies will confirm what was found in the cross-sectional studies, and thus \nallow more generalizable conclusions. Using the conditioned head turn procedure, English \ninfants were tested on the Contour-Contour contrast [ba&] vs. [ba^] only, because discrimination of \nthe Level-Contour contrast in the cross-sectional studies was poor. Chinese infants were tested \nfor discrimination of both the Contour-Contour and Level-Contour contrast. \nInfants\u2019 Tone Perception 21\nExperiment 3a: Longitudinal Study of Chinese-learning Infants\u2019 Discrimination of Lexical Tone  \nParticipants \nTen Chinese-learning infants (8 girls and 2 boys) were tested at 6 months of age (M = \n6.02, Range = 5.48-6.79, SD = .35) and again at 9 months of age (M = 9.06,  Range = 8.6-9.48, \nSD = .21).  \nResults and Discussion \nA 2 x 2 repeated measures factorial ANOVA with Age (6 months and 9 months) as the \nwithin-subjects variable and Contrast (Contour-Contour or Level-Contour) as the between-\nsubjects variable was performed on percent correct. As shown in Figure 4, panel 3a, at 6 months \nof age the infants achieved a mean percent correct of 64.65% (SD = 17.35) and when retested at \n9 months of age discrimination was not significantly different at 61.55% (SD = 18.99; F(1, 8) = \n.118, p = .740, \u014b2 = .015). Moreover, performance was above chance at 6 months, t(18) = 2.670, \np =.016, and 9 months, t(18) = 2.223, p = .039).Thus, Chinese-learning infants show no evidence \nfor a decline in discrimination of lexical tone contrasts between 6 and 9 months of age. There \nwas also no difference in discrimination of the Contour-Contour (M = 69.3%, SD = 15.13) vs. \nLevel-Contour contrast (M = 56.9%, SD = 12.30) F(1, 8) = .1123, p = .112, \u014b2 = .284, and no \ninteraction F(1, 10) = .019, p = .893, \u014b2 = .002.  \nThis longitudinal study confirms the findings of Experiment 1a, that is, that there is no \nchange between 6 and 9 months in Chinese-learning infants\u2019 discrimination of lexical tone, and \nno difference in discrimination of the Contour-Contour and Level-Contour contrasts.  \n \nExperiment 3b: Longitudinal Study of Chinese-learning Infants\u2019 Discrimination of Non-speech \nTone \nInfants\u2019 Tone Perception 22\nParticipants \nTen infants (9 girls, 1 boy) from Chinese-speaking families participated. They were \ntested at 6 months (M = 6.06 months, Range = 5.5-6.70, SD = .358) and 9 months of age (M = \n9.03 months, Range = 8.60-9.48, SD = .216). No additional infants were tested.  \nResults and Discussion \nA repeated measures 2 (Age) x 2 (Contrast) ANOVA was performed and failed to reveal \neffects of Age (M6months= 55.56%, SD = 14.74; M9months = 67.26%, SD = 17.51, \u014b2 = .236), F (1,8) \n= 2.473, p = .154 ), Contrast (MContour-contour = 62.9%, SD = 16.33; MLevel-contour = 59.9%, SD = \n17.21, \u014b2 = .018) F(1,8) = .143, SD = .715), or Age x Contrast interaction for the Chinese-\nlearning infants\u2019 non-speech tone discrimination (F(1,8) = .074, p = .792, \u014b2 = .009), as shown in \nFigure 4, panel 3b. Non-speech tone discrimination was below chance at 6 months, t (18) = \n1.193, p = .248, but improved to above chance responding at 9 months, t (18) = 3.117, p = .006. \nThe longitudinal investigation of Chinese-learning infants\u2019 non-speech tone \ndiscrimination revealed equivalent discrimination of the Contour-Contour and Level-Contour \nnon-speech tone contrasts and performance that did not change between 6 and 9 months of age in \nterms of percent correct. These findings support the cross-sectional data (Experiment 1b) in \nwhich no Age or Contrast effects were found.  \n Experiment 4a: Longitudinal Study of English-learning Infants\u2019 Discrimination of Lexical Tone \n English-learning infants were tested on the Contour-Contour lexical tone contrast only, \nas the results of Experiment 2b highlight the difficulty of the Level-Contour contrast for these \ninfants. For their data to be included in the longitudinal study, infants were required to reach \ndiscrimination criterion at the initial test phase at 6 months in order to be tested at 9 months, so \nInfants\u2019 Tone Perception 23\nas to allow careful investigation of how the ability to discriminate tone contrasts might change \nover age. \nParticipants  \nTwelve infants (7 girls and 5 boys) were first tested at 6 months (M = 6.41months, \n Range = 6.13-6.79, SD = 0.11) and retested at 9 months of age (M = 9.34 months; Range = 9.18-\n9.61 SD = 0.11). Two additional infants were tested and rejected from the data analysis for \nfussiness during the test session. \nResults and Discussion \nA paired samples t-test with Age (6months, 9 months) as the independent variable was \nperformed on percent correct discrimination (Figure 4, panel 4a). While there was, as expected, a \nreduction in discrimination over age between 6 (M = 75.52%, SD = 12.92) and 9 months (M = \n65.91%, SD = 13.53), this difference was not significant, t (11) = 1.508, p = .160, and \nperformance was above chance at both 6 months, t (22) = 6.841, p = .001, and 9 months, t (22) = \n4.073, p = .001. \n Experiment 4b: A Longitudinal Study of English-learning Infants\u2019 Discrimination of \nNon-speech Tone \nParticipants  \nEleven infants (6 girls and 5 boys) were tested at 6 (M = 6.37 months, Range = 6.03-6.82, SD = \n.18) and then 9 months (M = 9.22, Range = 9.02-9.48, SD = .13). Three more infants were tested, \nbut were discounted because of crying (1), fussiness (1), or failure to return for the 9 months test \nsession (1). All infants reached the criterion for discrimination at 6 months of age and were then \nre-tested at 9 months of age.  \nInfants\u2019 Tone Perception 24\nResults and Discussion \nA paired sample t-test revealed that mean percent correct discrimination of the Contour-\nContour non-speech tone contrast was statistically equivalent (t (10) = .709, p = .505) at 6 (M = \n76.87; SD =11.30) and 9 months of age (M = 72.28; SD = 13.61), as shown in Figure 4, panel 4b.  \nThis result was further supported by above chance performance at both 6 t (20) = 7.887, p = .001 \nand 9 months, t (20) = 5.431, p = .001. The finding that there is no decline in discrimination of \nthe non-speech contrast with age is in accordance with the findings of Experiment 2b.  \nOverall, the longitudinal study of English-learning infants\u2019 non-speech tone \ndiscrimination revealed no change in discrimination performance between 6 and 9 months of age \nfor discrimination of the rising vs. low non-speech tone contrast.  \nGENERAL DISCUSSION \nIn general, the findings support the hypothesis of perceptual reorganization for tone in \ntwo ways. Firstly, no age-related decline in lexical tone discrimination was found for Chinese-\nlearning infants (Experiment 1a, Experiment 3a). Secondly, for English-learning infants the \nresults of the cross-sectional study (Experiment 2a) highlight a progressive decline over age in \nlexical tone discrimination performance. When English-learning infants were tested \nlongitudinally (Experiment 4a) for lexical tone discrimination, there was no significant decline in \ndiscrimination with age, although there was an effect in the expected direction. A number of \npossibilities can be entertained to explain why no decline in discrimination was found in \nExperiment 4a. The first is the issue of statistical power. Only 12 English-learning infants were \ntested longitudinally and increased sample size may reveal perceptual reorganization. Moreover, \nit is possible that, as only those infants who met the discriminate criterion at 6 months were \ntested at 9 months, they may represent a sub-set of the English-learning infant population \u2013 they \nInfants\u2019 Tone Perception 25\nmay be just those infants who are more resilient to a perceptual decline between 6 and 9 months, \nand for whom perceptual reorganization may emerge later in development. In other words, this \nparticular sample of infants may be maintaining the distinction longer than their peers \nWe draw the conclusion that a considerable degree of perceptual reorganization for tones \ntakes place between 6 and 9 months, and that this reorganization is indexed by attenuation of \ndiscrimination performance for linguistically irrelevant tones, in the same manner as attenuation \nof discrimination performance for linguistically irrelevant consonants between 10 and 12 months \n(Best et al., 1988; Werker, et al., 1981; Werker & Tees, 1983; 1984), and for linguistically \nirrelevant vowels between 6 and 8 months (Kuhl et al., 1992; Polka & Werker, 1994). However, \ngiven the slight conflict between the findings for non-speech contrast discrimination by English \nlanguage infants in the cross-sectional (Experiment 2b) and longitudinal (Experiment 4b) studies, \nwe concede that the present results are not perfectly generalizable at this stage.  Moreover, the \nexact onset and offset of heightened perceptual sensitivity for tones cannot be determined here: \nTo ascertain whether experiential influences on tone perception are evident as early as for vowel \nperception (Kuhl et al., 1992; Polka & Werker, 1994) or as late as for consonant perception (Best \net al., 1988; Werker, et al., 1981; Werker & Tees, 1983; 1984), further research is required. We \nare currently investigating this issue and have preliminary data pointing towards a decline in \nnonnative lexical tone discrimination from 4 months of age.  \nThe age-related decrease in tone perception occurs only for tones in speech and not for \ntones in non-speech.  As tone stimuli can be created in speech and non-speech contexts with \nexactly the same F0 characteristics and with precise control of the speech\/non-speech dimension, \nthese results provide compelling evidence for dissociation between perception of speech and \nnon-speech, possibly more compelling than parallel findings with segmental distinctions \nInfants\u2019 Tone Perception 26\n(Mattingly, Liberman, Syrdal, & Halwes, 1971). One take on these findings is that tone \nperception is functionally-specific, that is, what infants are exposed to early in life seems to be \nreflected in their discrimination performance- if tone distinctions are present in the native \nlanguage, then perceptual attention to them is maintained over age; if tone distinctions are not \npresent in the native language, then attention to tone in speech declines. Our finding that infants \ndiscriminate the non-speech contrasts well, in the absence of early exposure to such contrasts, \ncan be attributed to the role of perceptual mechanisms that are robustly sensitive to low-level \nproperties of the stimuli.  \nWith regard to contrast type, English-learning infants in this study appear to find the \nContour-Contour contrast easier to discriminate (as evidenced by the main effect of contrast \ntype), and thus perhaps more psychoacoustically salient than the Level-Contour contrast in both \nthe speech and non-speech contexts (Burnham & Francis, 1997). However, for the Chinese-\nlearning infants at both ages, discrimination of the Contour-Contour versus Level-Contour \ncontrast was not significantly different, in either the speech or non-speech context.  It is \ninteresting that experience with lexical tone generalizes to non-speech perception. Certainly in \nthe adult literature (Burnham et al., 1996), there is some indication that, compared to non-tone \nlanguage speakers, tone language speakers are significantly better at discriminating both lexical \ntone and non-speech tone contrasts, indicating a possible effect of specific language experience \non non-speech processing (for further discussion of this issue see Burnham & Mattock, in press). \nAlternatively, it could be that the specific nature of the non-speech stimuli used here makes them \neasier to discriminate than the complex broadband speech stimuli (the lexical tones), such that \nmaintained discrimination over age is related to the salient nature of the non-speech contrasts, \nInfants\u2019 Tone Perception 27\nrather than to the generalization of experience from lexical tone contrasts to non-speech \ncontrasts. \nAlthough Chinese infants\u2019 patterns of discrimination remained unchanged over age, \npercent correct for Chinese infants was not as high as what might be expected for tone language \nlisteners with attuned perception. One reason for this, and essentially one limitation of these \nstudies, is that Chinese infants were tested on Thai lexical tones, that is, on nonnative tones. It is \nlikely that the Thai tone contrasts were less familiar and thus more difficult for them than if the \nlexical tone contrasts were drawn from the repertoire of Chinese tones. This notion is supported \nby evidence that tone language-speaking adults are better at discriminating tones in their native \nlanguage than nonnative tones (Lee, Vakoch, & Wurm, 1996), so it is quite possible that tone \nlanguage-learning infants would show a similar pattern of discrimination if tested on native tone \ncontrasts. In addition, in one developmental account of tone perception (Clumeck, 1980) it is \nsuggested that in order to acquire tones, tone language speakers must come to know which tones \nare used phonemically in their language, and which are not. Presumably then, the tone language-\nlearner must be able to discriminate successfully between native tones in order to produce them, \nand this language-specific tone perception may well begin in infancy. In future studies it would \nbe of interest to compare tone language-learning infants\u2019 discrimination of nonnative and native \ntone contrasts. It might be expected that there would be language-general discrimination by \nyoung infants, that is, no difference between discrimination performance for native and \nnonnative lexical tone contrasts, with an emergence of language-specific discrimination during \nthe second half of the first year post-partum. Irrespective of this possibility, the fact that here the \nEnglish language infants\u2019 discrimination performance for lexical tones decreases between 6 and \nInfants\u2019 Tone Perception 28\n9 months, and that Chinese infants\u2019 discrimination performance does not  \u2013 even with nonnative \ntones \u2013 is strong evidence for the reorganization of tone perception between 6 and 9 months.   \nA second possible reason for Chinese-learning infants lower than expected performance \nrelates to the cognitive demands of processing tone. Tone is an extra feature in the input to learn \nconcurrently with vowels and consonants, and perceptual attention to these features may be \ndivided in the online processing of the speech stream. For example, for vowels, infants in all \nlanguage environments must process F1 (relating to tongue height), F2, (vowel backness) and F3 \n(phonemic quality) etc., and combine these into phonemic vowel categories. Over and above \nthis, tone language learning infants must also process F0 (related to the tone of the vowel), and \nother phonetic features related to tone phonemes \u2013 duration, amplitude etc. Therefore to \ndiscriminate lexical tone contrasts, Chinese-learning infants possibly process the phonetic cues \nfor tone phonemes including duration, amplitude, and F0 height and contour, whereas English-\nlearning infants listening to lexical tones possibly apply their consonant and vowel specific \nexperience and attend only to the general acoustic dimensions of lexical tone, such as F0 height \n(and as this is not a tone-specific feature, it may not carry a high cognitive load). Accordingly, it \nmay be the case that tone language learning infants may have less perceptual ability with tones as \nattentional resources are spread across forming categories for tones, consonants, and vowels, \nwhereas for non-tone language learning infants phonemic attention is shared only across \nconsonant and vowel categories.          \nIn summary, and pending confirmation by further studies, the state of our current \nknowledge is that there is a decline in lexical tone discrimination between 6 and 9 months of age \nfor English-learning infants, but no such decline for Chinese-learning infants. Neither language \ngroup shows a decline over age for non-speech tone discrimination. However there are still many \nInfants\u2019 Tone Perception 29\nunknown aspects of infants\u2019 tone perception. For example, there are a number of issues \npertaining to the interaction been tone and intonation in IDS and these are discussed below \nespecially regarding their influence on tone perception and its development. \nOf the two language groups in this study it seems more likely that the English-learning \ninfants would treat the lexical tone stimuli akin to IDS because their native language has not \nprepared them for the contrastive use of tones (Trainor & Desjardins, 2002; Karzon & Nicholas, \n1989).To counter this possibility, it would be worthwhile testing discrimination of tone contrasts \nin English language infants following pre-exposure to Thai or English speech recordings. It \nmight be expected that tone discrimination would be better following Thai because of the pre-\nexposure to lexical tone in speech. Such a finding would be consistent with the results of a study \nby Maye, Werker, and Gerken (2002), who found that after just a few minutes of exposure to a \nnovel language, infants\u2019 sensitivity to the phonetic categories of that language improved. If such \nshort-term learning effects were also found in tone pre-exposure studies, this would support the \nnotion that statistical learning is the mechanism by which infants come to learn about tone \ncategories in speech. There is some evidence that infants use this mechanism to learn transitional \nprobabilities between non-linguistic tone sequences (Saffran, Johnson, Aslin & Newport, 1999), \nbut whether repeated exposure to linguistic tone categories can modulate sensitivity to the lexical \ntone feature remains to be investigated.  \nFor Chinese language-learning infants, lexical tones and the pitch contours of IDS are \ncombined in the speech they hear from their caregivers. Could IDS contours in tone languages \nfacilitate acquisition of tone distinctions for these infants? In this regard some distinct differences \nbetween the mean F0 and pitch range in tone and non-tone language IDS have been found \n(Grieser & Kuhl, 1988; Kitamura et al., 2002). For example, Mandarin-speaking mothers express \nInfants\u2019 Tone Perception 30\nvocal affect by forgoing tone identity to preserve exaggerated IDS pitch contours (Grieser & \nKuhl, 1988). On the other hand, Kitamura et al. (2002) found that tone mothers\u2019 speech changes \nto convey correct tone information just when infants are becoming phonemically tuned and \nlexically responsive. It is possible then that a relationship exists between the nature of IDS to \ntone language infants of different ages, and their ability to discriminate lexical tone contrasts in \nIDS.  Clearly, further research on this issue is required. \nWhile there are still many questions to be answered with respect to infants\u2019 tone \nperception, the experiments reported here provide evidence for at least some perceptual \nreorganization over a 3-month period, from 6 to 9 months \u2013 a perceptual reorganization that is \nlanguage-specific and speech-specific.  Together with evidence from earlier studies there is now \nevidence for a 4 to 12 month period around the second half of the first post-natal year for \nheightened sensitivity to all phonologically relevant characteristics of the language environment \n- consonants, vowels, and tones.  \nInfants\u2019 Tone Perception 31\n \nReferences \nAbramson, A.S.

In a regression \nanalysis this factor did not predict infants' speech or non-speech tone discrimination. Thus \nChinese infants' equivalent tone discrimination in speech at 6 and 9 months is not related to \ndegree of tone language experience, but rather to tone language experience per se. \n3 We do not suspect any gender differences in discrimination performance. Lexical tone \ndiscrimination was compared across gender in Experiment 2a  (where the number of boys versus \ngirls is more balanced). No performance advantage for either group, t (46) = -1.699, p = .096 was \nfound. \n4 Only infants reported by the parent to be Cantonese-only or Mandarin-only were included in \nthe statistical analysis. Infants exposed to Cantonese and Mandarin, or English and one of the \nChinese languages were not included in the analysis. \nInfants\u2019 Tone Perception 39\nFigure Captions \nFigure 1.
