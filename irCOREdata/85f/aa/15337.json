INTRODUCTION\nExcitability is quite an old concept, which is particularly\nwell known in biology @1\u20133# where it is used to explain a\nnumber of phenomena including neural communication by\nnerve cells via electrical signalling. A system is said to be\nexcitable if a stimulus below some threshold value produces\na negligible response while one above the threshold results in\na substantial response which is essentially independent of the\nsize of the stimulus. Excitability also occurs in chemistry @4#,\nphysics, and engineering @5\u20138#. Some general concepts of\nexcitability in optics and associated models have been dis-\ncussed in Ref. @9#. Excitability in optics is of great interest\nbecause of its prospects for applications in optoelectronics\ndevices, primarily for optical switching, clock recovery,\npulse reshaping, tuneable pulses, and for generating a coher-\nent resonance output pulse in communication networks.\nReference @5# has proposed and discussed excitability in a\nring cavity containing a homogeneously broadened two-level\nnonlinear medium. Excitability in this system occurs in the\nsmall parameter window close to a bistable operating region,\nand originates from the combined dynamical effects of non-\nlinear intracavity field saturation and temperature-dependent\nabsorption in the medium on two different times scales. The\norigin of the excitability is similar to that in the FitzHugh-\nNagumo model. More recently, excitability has been pre-\ndicted in lasers with a saturable absorber @6#, with delayed\noptical feedback @7# and with an integrated dispersive reflec-\ntor @8#. In Ref. @6# it is shown that a laser with a saturable\nabsorber displays excitability just below threshold. The ana-\nlytical expression for the excitability threshold was obtained\nby considering the slow-fast nature of the system. Under the\ninfluence of optical noise the laser displays coherence reso-\nnance. Excitability in this system is due to an attractor close\nto a saddle point. This is the second type of mechanism\nleading to excitability that is found in literature.\nIn this paper, we have studied the excitability of excitons\nand biexcitons in a nonlinear optical ring cavity. The optical\nnonlinearity is considered to be due to the creation of biex-\ncitons by the interaction of excitons and photons. The relax-\nation times of excitons and biexcitons are very short, being\nof the order of picoseconds, which means that mechanisms\nbased on them are suitable for use in optoelectronic devices\nwhere ultrafast response is required. Biexcitons can be\nreadily created in wide gap semiconductors such as CuCl,\nCuBr, and CdS where the electron-hole interaction is strong.\nBut different mechanisms for their formation in bulk semi-\nconductors have been proposed in the literature. The giant\noscillator strength model which has been proposed by Hana-\nmura, and Gogolin and Rashba @10,11# has been successfully\napplied to explain many biexciton-related optical processes\nin bulk semiconductors. More recently, Ivanov, Haug, and\nKeldysh have proposed a bipolariton model of biexcitons\n@12#. It has been shown @13\u201315# that both microscopic mod-\nels can be used to form the basis of theoretical description of\nthe phenomena of optical bistability, self pulsation, and\nchaos. Comparison with high-precision experiments supports\nthe view @12,16# that the bipolariton model gives the better\ndescription of the microscopic processes, particularly in low-\ndimensional systems. Nevertheless, the giant oscillator\nmodel has had considerable success in bulk semiconductors\nand provides a basis for a model of excitability which is\nsubstantially more tractable than what is currently possible\nwith the bipolariton theory.\nThe paper is structured as follow. In Sec. II we present the\nmodel equations for excitons, biexcitons, and photons in the\nring cavity and the bifurcation analysis. Section III demon-\nstrates excitable behavior in the system and the possible ap-\nplications of excitability are discussed. The conclusions are\ngiven in Sec. IV.\nII. DYNAMICS\nA. Equations\nFor simplicity we use the three-level model which has\nbeen previously applied to a CuCl crystal, where there is\nconvincing experimental evidence of the existence of biexci-\ntons. In a CuCl crystal the biexciton bond energy is of the\norder of 40 meV and the exciton absorption band and the M\nband of biexciton recombination are well separated from\neach other. We study the simultaneous action of two indepen-\ndent optical pulses. The photons of the first pulse with energy\nhv15Eg2Iex are in resonance with a transition in the exci-\nton spectral range. The photons of the second pulse, which\n*Author to whom correspondence should be addressed.

Bifurcation diagrams\nIn this section, we discuss the ring cavity dynamics of\nexcitons and biexcitons in terms of bifurcation diagrams. The\ncalculations were carried out with the software package\nAUTO97 @24# for continuation and bifurcation problems in\nordinary differential equations. Specifically, we applied a nu-\nmerical bifurcation analysis to Eqs. ~7!\u2013~10!. The initial con-\nditions (X1 ; X2 ; U; V)5@Y 1 \/(112C1); 0; X1 ; 0# have\nbeen used, which correspond to the steady state with a con-\nstant pump so that there is a steady-state population of exci-\ntons. In particular, we consider the bifurcation diagram in the\nplane X22Y 2 ~output amplitude-input amplitude! with the\namplitude of the input pulse Y 2 as the parameter to be varied\n~branching parameter!. Figure 2 shows a typical example of\nthe bifurcation diagram for the system. The parameters used\nare s15s25s50.1, C15C255, d50.1, and Y 1510. A\nthin continuous line represents stable stationary solutions,\nand unstable stationary solutions are indicated by a thin dot-\nted line. A thick solid line represent a stable periodic solu-\ntion. The unstable periodic solutions are marked by thick\ndotted line. It is well known that a Hopf bifurcation point\n~marked by the square! connects the stationary solution with\nthe periodic solution. It is apparent in Fig. 2 that the periodic\nbranch turns back and loses stability. This kind of bifurcation\nis described as subcritical. When Y 2 is increased from Y 3(0)\nto Y 2(H), X2 jumps to a large amplitude periodic orbit as\nhard generation of a limit cycle occurs. When Y 2 is reduced\nfrom Y 2(T) a discontinuity occurs again at Y 2(P) with a\njump from a large value to equilibrium. In the region OP at\nany given Y 2 , there is only one equilibrium state, a stable\nfocus which attracts all orbits. A stable periodic orbit, a\nstable equilibrium, and an unstable periodic orbit coexist in\nthe domain Y 2(P)2Y 2(H). In this interval we have a hys-\nteresis loop of periodic solutions. Moving from H to T, a\nstable limit cycle is the only attractor. The periodic branch\nends at T where a homoclinic orbit is present and the periods\nof periodic orbits tends to \u2018. The nature of self-pulsations in\nthe region HT for different parameters has been discussed in\n@14#.\nTwo saddle-point bifurcations are marked by rhombuses\nin Fig. 2. A stability analysis of Eqs. ~7!\u2013~10! shows that\nbetween H and S2 there is a transition from an unstable focus\nto an unstable node at point FN. On the other hand, at point\nNF we detect the transition from a stable node to a stable\nfocus.\nNow we discuss in more detail the region between the\nsaddle-node bifurcations S1 and S2 . It is known that the\nexistence of a saddle point close to an attractor is the require-\nment for excitable behavior. The inset in Fig. 2 shows a\nsketch of the phase portraits in the plane X22X1 in this\nregion. There is an attractor ~stable node in nonlinear case!, a\nsaddle, and an unstable focus for a fixed value of amplitude\nof the input pulse Y 2 . A sufficiently large perturbation can\nbring the system below the stable manifold ~separatrix! of\nthe saddle point so that the system makes a big loop around\nthe unstable focus ~dotted line in inset of Fig. 2!. In this\nregion the system shows excitability with a mechanism simi-\nlar to that in Ref. @6#.\nIII. EXCITABILITY\nA. Demonstration of excitability and discussion\nA system is excitable if it exhibit the following properties\n@6,7#:\n~i! the existence of a threshold above which an excitation\ncan occur,\n~ii! above threshold the form of the response independent\nof the perturbation magnitude,\n~iii! a refractory period exists.\nAs noted in the previous section, our system is excitable\nin the region S12S2 , and we now discuss the dynamics of\nthis phenomenon in more detail. We choose suitable values\nof the parameters to achieve excitability. The criterion for the\nexistence of hysteresis of stationary solutions is the inequal-\nity Y 1.A2(112C1)2\/C2 @14#. The parameters s and d in-\nfluence the dynamics of the system and we choose d50.1\nsince we consider the relaxation time of excitons to be one-\norder smaller than that of biexcitons. In this case for any s\n,0.1 the behavior of the system is similar to that sketched in\nFig. 2. We choose the operating point close to the saddle-\npoint S1 . First we consider the response of the system to a\nFIG. 2. The bifurcation diagram for Y 1510, s50.1, C15C2\n55, and d50.1. Thin solid: stable stationary states.

PHYSICAL REVIEW E 65 026616\n026616-3\nrectangular input pulse of amplitude Y 0 . The initial condi-\ntions correspond to point G in Fig. 2, for which Y 258.8. For\nthis point we found the threshold perturbation value Y 0\n50.695. Figure 3~a! shows the response of the system to a\nperturbation of amplitude Y 050.69, which is below thresh-\nold. When the amplitude of the perturbation is increased to\nY 050.7 which is above the threshold the system starts to\nexhibit excitable behavior with a significant pulselike reduc-\ntion in X2 as shown in Fig. 3~b!. To study the trend of tra-\njectories in the phase space, let us assume that the duration\ndt of applied stimulus Y 0 is much shorter than the charac-\nteristic time of the system. In that case the stimulus affects\nonly the amplitude X2 and the phase trajectories start at\n(X1 , X2 , U , V)5(X1st , dX2 , Ast, Bst) . Figure 3~b! shows\nthe trajectories in the plane X22X1 , for a stimulus below\nthreshold-trajectory A (dX251.05), and above threshold-\ntrajectory B(dX251.06). Trajectory A turns back to equilib-\nrium in contrast to trajectory B which makes a big loop\naround the unstable focus. The position of trajectory A is\nsituated higher than the stable manifold of the saddle ~see\ninset of Fig. 2! while the starting point of trajectory B is\ndown that stable manifold. The threshold is situated along\nthe stable manifold. The dependence of excitable threshold\nX2\nth on Y 2 is shown in the inset of Fig. 4. With the increase of\nY 2 from Y 2(S1), the saddle point moves down and the am-\nplitude of threshold increases meaning that the system be-\ncomes less excitable. Figure 4 shows the dependence of the\nvalue of the minimum in the response of the transmitted field\nX2\nmin on the amplitude of the perturbation Y 0 for two differ-\nent values of Y 2 . It shows that near S1 we need only a small\nperturbation amplitude in contrast to point S2 , where a\nhigher-perturbation amplitude is necessary to achieve excit-\nability and also the jump at the threshold is less pronounced.\nHowever above threshold the response is essentially inde-\npendent of perturbation magnitude, and the second character-\nistic of excitability is fulfilled.\nFinally we give an example to confirm the existence of a\nrefractory period. Two pulses with amplitudes above thresh-\nold are applied to the system. Figure 5~a! shows the response\nof the system when the delay time between pulses is td\n525. It does not differ from the response to a single pulse\n~see Fig. 3~b! for comparison!. When the second pulse is\napplied with delay time td550 there is a small reaction to it.\nAfter increasing td further to 75 we can distinguish a clear\nresponse to the second pulse. The system is able to make a\ndistinct and essentially identical response to both pulses\nwhen td.100. We conclude that for this set of parameters\nthe refractory time is the order of 45t.\nB. Applications of excitability\nOne motivation for research into excitability is its pos-\nsible application in all-optical signal processing. This section\nshows some examples of the possible applications of excit-\nability. As an optical limiter, the excitable element could\nserve to limit or suppress the noise level and any pulses\nbelow threshold. The excitable element can also be used as a\nlogic element. For a subthreshold input we have zero output,\nbut for an input above threshold the output is a one signal.\nConsider a sequences of pulses ~t515 width! with differ-\nent amplitudes and different delay time between pulses, such\nas the case shown in Fig. 6~a!. We observe a big response\nonly to input pulses which exceed the threshold. Other pulses\ncause negligible response and should be recognized as zero\nFIG. 3.

The selection criterion ~position of threshold! can\nbe varied by changing the parameters of the system. When\nall the pulses exceed the threshold, the response is similar to\ncoherent resonance. Figure 6~c! shows such a response to\nabove threshold, equally spaced pulses at a value of t550.\nHitherto it has been tacitly assumed that the experimental\ndetection of excitability may be realized for a system of ex-\ncitons and biexcitons in a ring cavity. Here we consider\nwhether it is possible to choose the parameters for CuCl\ncrystal so that the operating point is in the excitable region.\nFor CuCl reasonable material parameter values are: binding\nenergy of biexcitons is 40 meV, gex50.03 meV, gbiex\n50.3 meV, \\g50.3 eV\/(cm1\/2 V), G51.253108 cm3\/2.\nFor a cavity with L53 mm and T50.01, the intensities I1\n\u2019uE1u2510 kW\/cm2 and I2\u2019uE2u2589 kW\/cm2 ensure that\nthe cavity is in the excitable region. On the basis of our\ninvestigations and parameter estimations we conclude that it\nshould be possible to observe excitability in a system of\nexcitons and biexcitons in a ring cavity.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have shown that excitability of excitons and biexci-\ntons in a ring cavity can occur. In the bifurcation analysis it\nis found that the excitable region is situated in the domain\nwhere a saddle point is close to an equilibrium. In contrast to\nthe excitable behavior of two-level atoms in ring cavity @5#,\nwhere the behavior is similar to the FitzHugh-Nagumo\nmodel, excitons and biexcitons in a ring cavity show an other\ntype of excitability, similar to that in a laser with saturable\nabsorber @6#, where a perturbation can push the system above\nthe stable manifold of a saddle point. We have demonstrated\nthe existence of the threshold above which the system shows\na long excursion in phase space. The amplitude of the output\nfield for a perturbation above threshold is independent of this\nperturbation. The presence of a refractory period has also\nbeen demonstrated. A set of cavity and material parameters\nhave been identified for a system which could give an ex-\nperiment demonstration of the kind of excitability discussed.\nIt is concluded that the type of excitable system considered\nhas possible applications as a functional optoelectronic\nelement.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nV.T. acknowledges current financial support through a\nRoyal Society\/NATO grant and previously from the Alex-\nander von Humboldt Foundation.
