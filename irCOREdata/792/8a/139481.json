The article concludes by discussing some management initiatives helping to trigger the\nhuman-related factors.\nKeywords: international assignments; knowledge transfer; expatriation; multinational corporation\nIntroduction\nInternational assignees (IAs) in multinational companies (MNCs) have been traditionally depicted as senior\nmanagers, representing headquarters as general managers, marketing or accounting executives, assigned abroad\nfor relatively long periods of time (Boyacigiller 1990). At least in the context of subsidiaries in developed\ncountries, this picture belongs to the past. There is evidence that the number of these traditional expatriates is\nbeing progressively substituted by other shorter, less costly and more project oriented forms of international\nstaffing (Grainger and Nankervis 2001; Beavestock 2004). These alternative forms of international assignments\ninclude short-term assignments, self-initiated expatriation, and team assignments (Inkson, Arthur, Pringle and\nBarry 1997; Suutari and Brewster 2000; Bonache, Brewster and Suutari 2007). They have always been there,\nbut they are being used increasingly. This approach is better suited to a global environment of highly efficient\ntransport systems, growing availability of skilled local staff, and internet based communication.\nDespite the substantial reduction in the number of traditional expatriates, these alternative forms of working\ninternationally suggest that international assignments remain an important organizational strategy for MNCs.\nTheir function, however, has changed. Instead of covering managerial positions, that are now held by an\nincreasingly qualified set of local managers, their role is becoming more strategically oriented towards\nknowledge transfer and project work (Welch 2003; Beavestock 2004).\nIn contrast to this knowledge-oriented use of international assignees, most of the literature on international\nassignments has not departed significantly from the type of issues (i.e. concerns and expectations of dual-career\nexpatriates, cross-cultural adjustment, problems in repatriation) that dominated the field when assignments had a\npredominantly managerial orientation. With certain notable exceptions (Welch 2003; Holtbrugge and Berg\n2004; Riusala and Smale 2007), very little attention has been paid to the specific issues addressing international\nassignments in their knowledge transfer function. Conceptual work on this issue is at a very early stage.\nThe purpose of this article is to overcome this limitation and to explore international assignments from a\nknowledge management perspective. Adopting this perspective is justified by three main reasons. First, it is\nconsistent with the emerging view of the multinational firm as an institution for integrating knowledge (Gupta\nand Govindarajan 1991, 2000; Argote and Ingram 2000). Indeed, the collection, development and exploitation\nof organizational knowledge are often characterized as the main characteristics responsible for the success of\nMNCs (Bartlett and Ghoshal 1995). Second, knowledge is an asset closely related to human resources: it is\npeople who have the knowledge that is applied and transferred in the activities developed by the company (Itami\n1987). Finally, and as mentioned earlier, international assignments are increasingly used as a knowledge transfer\nmechanism.\nDrawing on the resource-based view (Barney\nIngram 2000), this article develops a conceptual framework to analyse the cause and effects of international\nassignments as a knowledge transfer mechanism. The first part focuses on the causal side. Following S\n(1996), knowledge transfer is conceived as a replication of an internal practice that is performed in a superior\nway in some part of the organization (the source unit) and is to be implemented in another unit (the recipient\nunit). In this context, we argue that depending on the characteristics of the knowledge to be transferred, the\norganization will make use of different types of internation\nthe factors affecting the success of international assignees as knowledge transferors. In addition to the\ncharacteristics of the knowledge transferred, three human\nof international staff; abilities and motivation of local staff; and the relationship between these two groups of\nemployees. Finally, we argue that certain management initiatives trigger the human\nof the conceptual model is presented in Figure\nBy relating international assignments to knowledge management issues, this study aims to design a theoretical\nbasis for international assignments that may guide future research in this area.\nKnowledge characteristics and international assignments\nThe term knowledge, although widely used by practitioners and academics, is usually relatively loosely defined\nin the literature. Kogut and Zander (\nrefer to input processes (e.g. purchasing skills), throughput processes (e.g. product designs), or output processes\n(e.g. marketing know-how). Kostova (\nof conducting organizational functions t\nhistory, people, interests and actions, and that have become institutionalized in the organization' (p. 309). Thus\nunderstood, knowledge differs from information, which is simply a stateme\nabout key customers, competitors or suppliers).\nAccording to the resource-based view of the firm (Wernerfelt\nArgote and Ingram 2000), some knowl\nthe firm from its competitors. Examples of such knowledge will vary, depending on what a particular firm\nconsiders its sources of competitive advantage to be (Kostova\nthe practices related to the company's innovativeness, whereas, for the clothing company Zara, this might be the\nknowledge supporting its strategic goal of offering new and fashionable products every ten days.\n1991; Wernerfelt 1984; Grant 1996; Peteraf\nal assignments. Then, on the effect side, we include\n-related factors are identified: abiliti\n-related factors. A summary\n1.\nFigure 1.

For Microsoft, this knowledge might be\n1993; Argote and\nzulanski\nes and motivation\n; Peteraf 1993;\nThe resource-based view also argues that the international strategy is dictated less by market opportunities than\nby the organization's own knowledge (Tallman and Fladmoe-Linquish 1994; Teece, Pisano and Shuen 1997).\nThe argument is that when firms have knowledge that is valuable, rare, inimitable and non-substitutable in their\nown market, they may also attempt to compete in other international markets where they can advantageously\ndeploy their existing knowledge.\nMNCs can thus develop knowledge in one location and exploit it in other locations, implying the internal\ntransfer of knowledge from the source to the recipient unit. Yet, transfers are not confined to those from\nheadquarters to foreign subsidiaries, but can occur in various directions within the MNC (Gupta and\nGovindarajan 1991, 2000). Internationalization provides learning opportunities through exposure of the\ncompany to new cultures, ideas, experiences, etc. (Teece et al. 1997). Some of this knowledge will be confined\nto its place of origin (i.e. it will be context-specific, Taylor, Beechler and Napier 1996), but other knowledge\nmight be effective across countries. The issue is how to transfer this strategic knowledge.\nSome knowledge to be transferred can be codified (expressed in words and numbers), and easily communicated\nand shared in the form of hard data, manuals, codified procedures, or universal principles (Polanyi 1962). In\nsuch a case, it can be transferred through a wide range of mechanisms. The widespread use of email and\ntelephone, company reports and visits is now increasingly supplemented by real-time information technology\n(Suutari and Brewster 2000). Given that international assignees are often very costly and difficult to manage;\nand that it is difficult to measure their contribution or value, there will be pressure to use these much cheaper\nmechanisms wherever possible.\nYet, a lot of knowledge transferred between units is not explicit but tacit (i.e. the capacities of employees from a\nparticular unit to launch new products). This knowledge is embedded in the experience and skills of the\norganization's members and is only revealed through its application (Polanyi 1962). Given that tacit knowledge\ncannot be codified or contained in manuals and can only be observed through its application, when a company\ndecides to transfer tacit knowledge between different units, it must assign employees to the foreign operations\n(Bonache and Brewster 2001). Hence, we propose that\nHypothesis\n1a\nIf knowledge to be transferred among units of a MNC has a tacit nature, the company will make\nuse of international assignments. If knowledge has an explicit character, it will be transferred by\nother means (manuals, information technology, annual meetings, etc.)\nAs mentioned earlier, several alternatives of international assignments have been identified, including team vs.\nindividual assignments, short-term vs. long-term assignments, and company vs. external market assignments.\nThese alternative forms of international assignments can be easily explained by taking into consideration\nadditional characteristics of knowledge (see Figure 2).\nFigure 2. Knowledge characteristics and type of international assignees.\nBeginning with the first alternative, team versus individual assignments, it is well documented that, despite the\nhigh emphasis on individuals rather than groups in the international HR literature, the transfer of knowledge\noften requires transferring teams, rather than individuals (Bonache and Brewster 2001). This is, however,\nlogical. Knowledge can be held collectively or individually (Spender 1996). Collective knowledge is associated\nwith capabilities: what a group of people working together is capable of doing. According to Grant (1996),\ncollective knowledge is the outcome of knowledge integration: it is the product of the coordinated efforts of\nmany individual specialists who possess different, but complementary, skills. Of course, both collective and\nindividual knowledge can be of a tacit nature. An example of tacit individual knowledge is the knowledge of a\nbrilliant intuitive stock-picker. On the contrary, the skills of creative teams to launch new products are an\nexample of tacit collective knowledge. Hence, we propose:\nHypothesis\n1b\nIf the knowledge to be transferred is tacit individual knowledge, the transfer will only involve that\nindividual. Yet, if the knowledge to be transferred among units of the MNC is tacit collective\nknowledge, then that transfer will involve the expatriation of a team.\nAnother distinction of knowledge refers to its scope. Some are very narrow in scope and involves performing a\ncertain task within a broader functional area (i.e. a firm's practices for encouraging team work). Others are\nbroader and require the integration of different types of expertise of a more narrow or specialized nature (Grant\n1995). For example, a bank's knowledge that allows it to offer better service quality to its customers depends on\nthe integration of different kinds of lower-level expertize such as management of investment funds and\ninsurance, personal and mortgage credits, consumer financing, credit card operations, customer service,\npersonnel motivation, etc. In terms of scope, it is subsidiary managers who possess the broadest type of\nknowledge and expertise. The type of knowledge they possess is usually more complex, less codeable and\nharder to teach than technical capabilities. As this knowledge is harder to transfer, the transfer process requires\nmore time (Zander and Kogut 1995). Other international assignees (i.e. functional specialists; technical experts\ndealing with operational process and product technologies) will often need shorter assignments.\nHypothesis\n1c\nThe duration of the assignment (e.g. short-term vs. long-term) will differ depending on the scope of\nthe knowledge to be transferred. In general, IA transferring broad knowledge will have longer\nassignments than those transferring narrow knowledge.\nA final useful distinction of knowledge refers to a company's dependence, with some being generic and others\nspecific (Milgrom and Roberts 1992). In contrast to generic knowledge, which is shared by all companies within\nthe industry and can be easily acquired on the labour market, specific knowledge is of an idiosyncratic nature;\nand refers to the way that things are done in a particular company and can only be acquired through observation\nand experience inside the company. As a result, if a company aims at transferring specific knowledge (i.e.\nadvanced technological expertise or specific marketing knowledge), and this can only be acquired within the\ncompany, then the basic recruitment source of international assignees will be the company itself. Yet, if the\nknowledge to be transferred is of a generic nature, the basic source of recruitment can be the external labour\nmarket. Self-initiated expatriates, a type of international assignee receiving increasing attention from the\nliterature (Inkson et al. 1997; Suutari and Brewster 2000), can thus be justified.\nHypothesis\n1d\nIf the knowledge to be transferred among units of the MNC is specific, the recruitment source of\nexpatriates will be the company itself. If it is generic, the source of recruitment can also be the\nexternal labour market.\nFactors favouring the success of international knowledge transferors\nIn the previous section we have recognized the importance of transfer of knowledge within MNCs as well as the\nrole that international assignees play in this process. Yet, researchers have shown that transferring knowledge\nwithin a firm is far from easy, as several barriers usually appear in this process. Along these lines, two main\ntheoretical models specifying the barriers to the success of the transnational transfer of knowledge within MNCs\nhave been provided, one developed by Szulanski (1996) and another by Kostova (1999). Szulanski (1996)\ndeveloped the notion of internal stickiness to refer to the difficulty of transferring knowledge within\norganizations. He identifies four sets of factors influencing the difficulty of knowledge transfer: characteristics\nof the knowledge transferred (i.e. causal ambiguity, unprovenness), of the source (i.e. lack of motivation, not\nperceived as reliable), of the recipient (i.e. lack of motivation and absorptive capacity), and of the context in\nwhich the transfer takes place (i.e. barren organizational context, arduous relationship). The findings of his\nempirical study showed that the major barriers to internal knowledge transfer are the recipient's lack of\nabsorptive capacity, causal ambiguity, and an arduous relationship between the source and the recipient.\nThe second notable theoretical contribution to the analysis of knowledge transfer is due to Kostova (1999).\nDrawing on a variety of theoretical perspectives (organizational behaviour, resource dependence, and\ninstitutional theory), she proposes an alternative set of factors affecting the success of transfers. Some are social,\nreferring to the degree to which the regulatory, cognitive, and normative profiles of the home country and the\nrecipient country are similar or different. Others are organizational, referring to compatibility between the\nvalues implied by the knowledge transferred and the values underlying the unit's firm culture, or to the degree to\nwhich the unit's organizational culture is supportive of learning, chance and innovation. Finally, others are\nindividual, referring to attitudes of transfer coalition members (i.e. their commitment to, identity with, and trust\nin the parent company).\nThese two theoretical approaches have been combined and tested by Riusala and Smale (2007) in a notable\nempirical study on the factors presenting particular challenges for 112 Finish expatriates in the transfers of\nknowledge. In addition to the characteristics of knowledge, they adopt the social, organizational, and individual\nfactors from Kostova (1999) to explain how expatriates perceive the challenging nature of knowledge transfer.\nCuriously enough, only three of the ten factors tested were statistically significant: one measuring the absorptive\ncapacity of the recipient unit, and two referring to knowledge characteristics (teachability and complexity;\nKogut and Zander 1993). Social and organizational factors of the kind included in Kostova's model were,\nhowever, nonsignificant.\nIn this article, we propose a different (although consistent with previous models) classification of factors\naffecting the success of international assignees as knowledge transferors. Instead of considering the social and\norganizational level variables included in the models of both Kostova and Szulanski, we focus on the factors\nhaving direct task-related implications for the international assignee. That is, instead of adopting an\norganizational level of analysis, as assumed in those two models, we adopt the perspective of individual\ninternational assignees dealing with specific local employees from a recipient unit.\nBy adopting this perspective, it can be argued that, in addition to knowledge characteristics (e.g. the degree of\nteachability and complexity), four sets of factors affect the success of international assignees (see Figure 1).\nThey have been divided into three main categories: abilities and motivation of international staff, abilities and\nmotivation of local staff, and relationship between these two groups of employees. We will continue by\nexplaining each of these categories.\nAbilities and motivation of international staff\nUnderperformance during the assignment has been shown to be a problem for many companies (Mendenhall\nand Oddou 1988; Harzing and Christensen 2002). For example, according to Black and Gregersen (1999),\naround 30% of international assignees have a performance level lower than expected. Similarly, Harvey and\nWiese (1998) state that of those that do complete their assignments, 30 to 50% are ineffective or marginally\neffective. The main reason given for underperformance was the inability of expatriates to adjust to a new cross-\ncultural environment.\nMany different models on factors facilitating cross-cultural adjustment have been provided (e.g. Caligiuri, Joshi\nand Lazarova 1999; Gilley, Harrison and Shaffer 1999). Factors such as family support, personality\ncharacteristics, organizational support and host nationals' attitudes have been included in many of these models.\nThey thus assume that not everyone is capable of working internationally, but only those exhibiting a particular\nprofile. The key issue is to avoid assuming that those who successfully perform their job locally can equally\nperform internationally. Additional qualities are required.\nIt is well known that to achieve a high performance at any level, not only the ability but also the motivation to\nperform effectively is needed (Baldwin 1959). This is especially relevant in the current discussion as it is well\ndocumented that individuals often display some reluctance to share knowledge (Nonaka and Takeuchi 1995; Z\nrraga and Bonache 2005). If so, international assignees may not fail to efficiently transfer knowledge because\nthey are incapable of doing it but rather because they are unwilling to do it. Thus, we propose the following\nhypothesis:\nHypothesis\n2a\nThe interaction between international assignees' ability and motivation will increase the level of\nknowledge transfer to the recipient unit.\nAbilities and motivation of local staff\nThe absorptive capacity of the receiving unit is also a very significant determinant of internal knowledge\ntransfer in MNCs (Szulanski 1996; Gupta and Govindarajan 2000). Cohen and Levinthal (1990) defined\nabsorptive capacity as the 'ability to recognize the value of new external information, assimilate it, and apply it\nto commercial ends' (p. 128). This absorptive capacity of a local unit resides with its employees. If their\npreexisting stock of knowledge prevents them from acquiring, assimilating and using the knowledge transferred\nby international assignees, a poor knowledge transfer will take place.\nAs in the case of international assignees, local employee's performance will depend on their abilities and\nmotivation. They may have a high absorptive capacity, but it will not be realized unless they are also motivated\nto absorb new knowledge. A lack of motivation may result in hidden sabotage, passivity, or outright rejection in\nthe implementation of the knowledge from the IA (Szulanski 1996). Accordingly, it can be argued that the\neffectiveness of international staff as a knowledge transfer mechanism will depend on local employees' abilities\nand motivation to acquire, assimilate and use this new knowledge. Thus, we propose:\nHypothesis\n2b\nThe interaction between local employees' ability and motivation will increase the level of\nknowledge transfer to the recipient unit.\nRelationship among local and international staff\nAnother factor affecting the success of an international knowledge transfer is a fertile or positive relationship\nbetween international and local staff. Several elements may create such a fertile relationship. One of these\nelements is ease of communication (Arrow 1974). It is through the vehicle of language that practices, meanings,\nvalues and ideologies are taught and learned. Therefore, proficiency in the local language by international\nassignees facilitates the transfer process. Yet, as Brannen (2004) has shown, transnational transfers involve\nmuch more than the transfer of linguistic signals. Transferring the linguistic signals alone does not ensure that\nthe meanings attached to them are transferred. Sense making occurs in context, and when context is not shared,\nmeanings are often lost. Examples of these semantic shifts abound. For example, the word 'bonus' in the US is\nseen as a reward for exceptional performance. This word also exists in Japan, but it refers to an expected portion\nof an employee's annual compensation. Accordingly, it is expected that the more the communicators' cultural\nworlds overlap, the more effective the communication between local and international staff will be.\nHypothesis\n2c\nFacility of communication between international and local staff will tend to create a fertile\nrelationship for knowledge transfer.\nAnother element that creates a fertile relationship is the interpersonal sensitivity on the part of international\nstaff. Interpersonal sensitivity refers to the concern and sensitivity shown by individuals in their exchanges with\nsubordinates or coworkers. Research has shown that, when individuals show sensitivity, the employees working\nwith them show greater acceptance of their actions, proposals and decisions (Chen, Choi and Chi 2002). The\nclassic studies of exchange relationships refer to two types of interpersonal sensitivity (Blau 1964). First, there\nis the social type, which has an eminently informal character and includes two socio-emotional types of\nexchange. Second, the transactional type, which is, to a large extent, formal and refers to exchanges of economic\nresources. While in the social area, more importance is attached to the informal exchanges, in the work area,\nattention is also paid to the sensitivity shown in economic transactions, and so both types must be taken into\naccount. In the context of this work, it can be assumed that international assignees with greater interpersonal\nsensitivity in their dealings with local employees generate a positive attitude from those locals towards them.\nClearly, such an attitude will facilitate the transfer.\nHypothesis\n2d\nA high degree of interpersonal sensitivity on the part of international assignees will tend to create\na fertile relationship for knowledge transfer.\nA third element creating a fertile relationship between locals and international employees is perceived\nreliability. When international assignees are perceived as reliable by local staff, a transfer of knowledge will be\neasier and their advice and example are likely to be easily accepted (Szulanski 1996). In this respect, nationality\nissues may play a vital role. International assignees are foreigners in the local unit, and foreignness is usually\nunderstood to be a liability. Nationalist feelings of host country employees are very common worldwide. Yet,\nthere may be some circumstances in which foreignness might be an asset in the international transfer process,\nbecause of their national background and origin, some international employees may have an initial level of\nlegitimacy, rather than illegitimacy (a 'German' engineer, or an 'Italian' designer). If this is indeed the case, the\nnationality of international staff will affect how their initiatives and proposals will be perceived and received by\nlocal employees. In general, because of their respective country images in a given host country, some\nnationalities will have more credibility and legitimacy than others when attempting to transfer and implement\ncertain types to knowledge.\nHypothesis\n2e\nA perception in the host country that international assignees are reliable will tend to create a fertile\nrelationship for knowledge transfer.\nFinally, a favourable atmosphere or team spirit between international and local staff, based on common goals\nand objectives, must exist within the group. Only in such an atmosphere, individuals will be encouraged to share\nand create knowledge (Z rraga and Bonache 2005). This climate has been defined in various ways: Lawler\n(1992) called it 'high involvement'; Von Krogh (1998) speaks of 'high care'. If this atmosphere does not exist,\nthen interpersonal cooperation, essential for the transfer and generation of true group knowledge, will not take\nplace. Thus, we propose:\nHypothesis\n2f\nA team spirit between international and local staff will tend to create a fertile relationship for\nknowledge transfer.\nManagement initiatives to favour knowledge transfer\nInternational management literature has tended to focus on the determinants of knowledge transfer. However,\nless is known on the mechanisms favouring these determinants. That is, what specific initiatives can a\nmultinational company adopt to trigger motivation and abilities of both local and international staff, as well as to\nelicit a fertile relationship between them.\nIn this respect, HRM practices can play a key role. According to the resource-based view, their goal is to attract,\nretain and motivate the sorts of skills and behaviours required by the organization to achieve its objectives\n(Wright, Dunfond, and Snell 2001). The objective here is knowledge transfer. To this end, HR practices have to\nwork in three different directions: international employees, local staff, and the relationship between them. In\nwhat follows, we include a series of HRM practices aiming in each of these three directions.\nInitiatives to promote the abilities and motivation of international staff\nBased on previous research, several initiatives are discussed (see Figure 3). Before mentioning each of these\ninitiatives, it is important to note that there are other initiatives (e.g. socialization activities) that may affect\ninternational assignees' motivation which are not discussed here. The initiatives included here are ones deemed\nmost likely to affect international assignees' abilities and motivation, given what is currently known about the\nsubject.\nFigure 3. HR practices toward international assignees to promote th\nRecruitment of IAs\nThere has been much research into the selectio\nfound out that technical expertize and domestic track record are by far the most dominant criteria (Brewster\n1991). The nature of knowledge explains this finding. If the fundamental reason for using expatriates is to\ntransfer the capabilities that provide the company with a strategic advantage over its competitors, the basic\nrecruiting criterion will have to be possession of these capabilities. The importance of this criterion is such that\nit imposes limits on company expansion. As\nmanagement personnel necessarily establish a limit on company expansion in any given period of time, since\nthis knowledge cannot be acquired on the market.\nThough strategically justified, the he\nin any one context can be translated to performance in any other. Yet, this assumption conflicts with our\nprevious argument regarding the need to evaluate additional qualities (e.g.\nanalysing the potential success of an international assignee. Accordingly, it may be argued that international\nstaff selected on the basis not only of technical competencies but also of other additional abilities, will be\neffective as knowledge transferors than those whose selection criteria limit to their performance at home.\nHypothesis\n3a\nThe extensive screening of prospective candidates will have a positive impact on international\nassignees' abilities to tran\nTraining of IA\nPreparation of those selected has also to be taken into consideration. Various attempts have been made to\ndevelop models of training and development for expatriates (Tung\nmanagers in MNCs often seem to doubt the wisdom or perhaps the effectiveness, of either general cultural\nawareness or specific country briefing activities (Tung\nassumption. By contrast, expatriates themselves tend to be very positive about this kind of training. The need for\nsuch preparation is likely to be determined in part by the type of knowledge to be\nassignments can involve the transfer of organizational culture. The international staff will have a key\nrepresentational role, requiring extensive interaction with locals; at the other, there are transfers which may be\nalmost entirely technology or equipment related, with the expatriate living in a tight expatriate community in a\ncapital city or even a specific compound reserved for their compatriots. Most, of course, will fall between these\nextremes, but the different requirem\nHypothesis\n3b\nThe extensive training of international assignees requiring interact\npositive impact on international assignees' abilities to transfer knowledge.\ne success of knowledge transfer\nn and preparation of expatriates.

At one extreme,\nents for preparation are clear (Pickard and Brewster 1995\nion with locals will have a\nmore\n1999).Yet,\n-equals-abroad\n).\nIn addition to the initiatives promoting the abilities of international assignees, motivation has also to be\nanalysed. This is usually described in terms of the basic goals of objectives that drive behaviour (Baron and\nKreps 2000). Motivation is not a goal in itself but should support a firm's goals. In our context, this means\nemployees must be motivated to efficiently perform their knowledge transfer function. A review of the\ninternational HRM literature reveals a number of initiatives that are likely to affect international assignees'\nmotivation. These initiatives may be categorized as either fostering intrinsic or extrinsic motivation.\nPerformance evaluation criteria of IA\nInternational assignees may have a myriad of job responsibilities in addition to knowledge transfer, including\nthe control of the local operation, image or representation, or coordination with other units (Brewster 1991).\nIndividuals consider the importance of competing goals and outcomes in determining which activities to engage\nin. Having this myriad of activities in mind, while an international assignee may wish to engage in knowledge\ntransfer activities, other work-related tasks may take priority. If the way the organization evaluates the\ninternational assignee considers other activities as more 'relevant', time spent on knowledge transfer may be\nviewed by the organization and the international assignee as detracting from other, more important, tasks. This\nwould be particularly true when the international staff have limited time availability, a very common problem in\ninternational work (Guzzo, Noonan and Elron 1993). In other words, international assignees' perception of the\nimportance attached by the company to knowledge transfer as a performance evaluation criterion is likely to\nincrease their efforts to transfer (Bjorkman, Barner-Rasmussen and Li 2004).\nHypothesis\n3d\nEmphasis on the importance of knowledge transfer in the performance evaluation criteria will have\na positive impact on international assignees' extrinsic motivation to transfer knowledge.\nExtrinsic rewards\nAn important determinant of almost any behaviour is the attainment of valued rewards. In an international\nassignments context, international assignees are likely to consider the possibility of receiving extrinsic rewards,\nsuch as raises, incentives and promotions. That is, it is possible that engaging in careful knowledge transferring\nwill be directly rewarded by the organization. Likewise, the international assignee may consider whether\nengaging in knowledge transfer activities will indirectly result in achievement of rewards. For instance,\nchanging the organizational culture of the recipient unit may result in improved unit performance. In turn, this\ncould lead to higher pay increases or a promotion for the international assignee. In general, the greater the direct\nand indirect perceived rewards derived from knowledge transfer, the more motivated the employee will be.\nIf so, it will be necessary for companies to depart from the prevailing view on international compensation (for a\nreview, see Bonache 2006). This views incentives merely as a tool to encourage employees to live and work\nabroad. In addition to this, compensation packages must be put in place to impel international assignees to\nminimize potential opportunism and promote their alignment with HQ's interest (i.e. knowledge transfer).\nHypothesis\n3e\nReward systems linked to knowledge transfer will have a positive impact on international\nassignees' extrinsic motivation to transfer knowledge.\nThe specification of performance evaluation criteria and the use of extrinsic rewards may be insufficient to\nensure the sort of efforts required for knowledge transfer. In this regard, it is vital to distinguish between the\nmotivations to participate versus the motivation to produce (March and Simon 1958). An international assignee\nmay be motivated by the extrinsic monetary rewards to take up an international assignment. This would be a\ntypical motivation to participate. In contrast, to contribute one's tacit knowledge hinges on intrinsic motivation.\nInternational assignees will be intrinsically motivated if they value their activity for its own sake and appear to\nbe self-sustained.\nIntrinsic motivation cannot be compelled but only enabled under suitable conditions. By its nature, it is always\nvoluntary. As discussed below, several HR initiatives can be implemented to foster intrinsic motivation; some of\nthem are related to the recruitment of potential candidates and others with the establishing of the conditions of\nthe assignment.\nSelection of prospective candidates\nIn a study about the nature of international work, Guzzo, Noonan and Elron (1993) found that for the majority of\ninternational assignees the best part of their assignment was related to their work. For example, they generally\nreported greater autonomy, variety and responsibility, elements that traditionally have being assumed to increase\nintrinsic motivation (Miller and Monge 1986). Similarly, a recent survey of a large population of German\nexpatriates (Stahl, Miller and Tung 2002), showed that the majority of expatriates view their international\nassignment as an opportunity for personal and professional development, despite perceived deficits in corporate\ncareer management systems and a widespread scepticism that the assignment will help advance within their\ncompanies. Yet, it is also well known that some employees are not so focused on professional development and\ndo not want much autonomy and responsibility; they want to be told what to do, how, when, and then be left\nalone.\nThis means that not every potential employee has the appropriate temperament and motivational profile to be an\neffective international assignee. It is important to recruit intrinsically motivated persons for the task at hand,\neither because it results in personal development and increased esteem or because it involves recognition from\nlocal employees or headquarters.\nHypothesis\n3f\nSelecting candidates who find engaging in knowledge transfer activities to be inherently satisfying\nwill have a positive impact on international assignees' intrinsic motivation to transfer knowledge.\nConditions of the assignment\nAn international assignee may also be intrinsically motivated to efficiently perform tasks because of personal\nloyalties. An international assignee who is considering making a relatively low effort in transferring knowledge\nmay feel that such behaviour will be disappointing for HQs or for local employees. Alternatively, he or she may\nfeel that his or her competence as an efficient employee will be questioned by either of these two groups.\nAlthough these types of personal concerns and considerations may be a complex construct, they appear to be\npotentially important factors here. If personal relationship strongly raises the intrinsic motivation to cooperate,\nestablishing a psychological contract based on emotional loyalties seems a reasonable HR initiative.\nIn the establishing of the psychological contract, participation of international assignees is vital. Participation\nsignifies an agreement on common goals. It is well documented that such an agreement raises the perceived self-\ndetermination and therewith strengthens intrinsic motivation (Baron and Kreps 2000). Curiously enough, a\ncommon complaint of international assignees is not to be aware of the specific goals of the assignment and not\nto have participated in their setting (Guzzo et al. 1993). If so, many companies are far from doing a good job in\npromoting the intrinsic motivation for the international knowledge transfer.\nHypothesis\n3g\nEstablishing psychological contracts based on emotional loyalties and participation will have a\npositive impact on international assignees' intrinsic motivation to transfer knowledge.\nInitiatives to promote the abilities and motivation of local staff\nThe initiatives in this area refer to the way local employees are treated and managed in the recipient unit.\nAccordingly, approaches and evidences from domestic HR literature are highly relevant in this area. In this\nrespect, we will limit ourselves to reflect very well known arguments and evidences regarding an efficient\nmanagement of local employees.\nWithin the domestic HRM field, there is increasing evidence that effective management of an organization's\nemployees leads to positive results and could be a possible source of sustainable competitive advantage (Wright\net al. 2001). Several authors argue for the existence of a synergistic effect of certain combinations of HR\npractices (e.g. Gerhart 1999; Wright and McMahan 1992). Such configurations are sometimes labelled 'high\nperformance work systems' or 'high commitment work systems' (Pfeffer 1994). Such configurations have been\nrelated to a range of outcomes and measures of firm performance, including profits, margins, and returns on\ninvestment. Overall, results of empirical work suggest substantial benefits from managing human resources\neffectively (Gerhart 1999).\nThe goal of high performance work systems is a dedicated and flexible workforce, working in the best interest\nof the organization. In these systems, employees help the organization to improve, by contributing and\nincorporating ideas and information needed\nconsisting in getting more from the employees, they also have to be given more.\nsummarize this differential treatment toward workforce by saying that employees who are recruited should be:\n(1) capable of and inclined to provide the sort of consummate and dedicated effort sought; (2) trained to fill in\ngeneral gaps in their capabilities; (3) enabled to be self\nprovide consummate effort.\nDespite this initial consensus in the way employees should be treated, many different sets of practices are\nincluded in high performance work systems. Previous research has bundled different HRM practices into two\nmain categories: those determining employees' ability (i.e.\nappraisal) and those determining employees' motivation (i.e. performance\ncommunication).\nMinbaeva et al. (2003) extended this research to the area of knowledge transfer within MNCs. They identify\nemployees' ability and motivation as the key aspects of the firm's absorptive capacity that in turn facilitates\nknowledge transfer, and found overall support for the argument that absorptive capacity is improved when HR\npractices oriented towards employees' ability and employees' motivation are applied. In particular, they found\nthat when local employees have been hired, trained an\nsystems linked to knowledge acquisition (i.e. performance\nthey exhibit a higher capacity and motivation to absorb new knowledge.\nDrawing on this research, it is reasonable to expect that, compared to those units with a more traditional and\nadversarial management approach, in the recipient units in which a high performance work system is\nimplemented, local employees will be more capable and motivated and,\nbe more successful in the their attempt to transferring knowledge.\nHypothesis\n3h\nHigh performance work systems implemented in the recipient unit will have a positive impact on\nlocal employees' abilities and m\nInitiatives to promote a fertile relationship between local and international staff\nKnowledge transfer is carried out within the context of interpersonal\nSeveral initiatives can also be carried out in this respect. Among them, three deserve special attention (see\nFigure 4):\nFigure 4. HR practices to promote a fertile rela\nSelection and training of IAs\nAlthough rarely implemented (recall the above\ntraining of international assignees), emphasizing cultural fit with the local environment in the selection and\ntraining of international assignees seems intuitive and commonsense.

Accordingly, selecting and\n2000)\nbased promotion),\nHypothesis\n3i\nEmphasizing cultural fit with the local environment in the selection and training of international\nassignees will facilitate communication, perceived reliability, interpersonal sensitivity and team\nspirit.\nWorking conditions\nCompensation and rewards are vital to elicit adequate team spirit, one of the four elements fostering a fertile\nrelationship to share knowledge. It is argued that team spirit will be barely created if the nature of the work\nbrings together employees from different subgroups, who receive different treatment (Baron and Kreps 2000).\nMNCs that combine international staff and local employees in the same setting, exemplify this phenomenon\nwell. The working conditions of these two groups are often very different, especially when it comes to salaries.\nOn average, an expatriate's salary is three times that of an equivalent local employee, especially in developing\ncountries (Reynolds 1986, 1997, 2000). In some countries, such as China, expatriates' salaries represent 20 or 30\ntimes those of local employees (Leung, Smith, Wang and Sun 1996).\nGiven these differences in treatment, it is logical that some of the recent work in international management\nliterature has highlighted the conflict between the goals of efficiency and justice in MNCs (Toh and DeNisi\n2003; Chen et al. 2002). On the one hand, strategic and efficiency considerations might render international staff\nan efficient recruitment option for knowledge transfer purposes. On the other hand, the use of international staff,\nas it usually involves a favourable salary treatment (Harvey 1993a,b; O'Really 1996; Bonache 2006), might\nhave its disadvantages in terms of perceived fairness and team spirit. It is arguable that locals may resent being\ntreated as second-class employees and respond with 'second-class' efforts. If so, local employees will probably\nperform poorly, cause disruptions to normal operations, and eventually jeopardize the full transfer of knowledge\nto the local operation.\nHypothesis\n3j\nDeemphasizing salary distinctions and promoting a sense of egalitarianism will facilitate\ncommunication, perceived reliability, interpersonal sensitivity and team spirit.\nSocialization\nResearch in the knowledge management field suggests that informal communication and close interpersonal\nnetworks favour both explicit and implicit knowledge sharing (Hedlund 1994). From this perspective, social\nevents, both informal (e.g. having coffee together during breaks or a drink after work) and formal (e.g. parties\nand dinners organized by the company) can be utilized as an effective initiative in the creation of a team\natmosphere. Ideally, these social events should establish a shared set of values, objectives, and beliefs between\nlocals and international employees, providing them with a shared mission and a unitary work spirit.\nHypothesis\n3k\nExtensive socialization between local and international employees will facilitate communication,\nperceived reliability, interpersonal sensitivity and team spirit.\nConclusion\nIn this article we have presented a model of the determinants of effective knowledge through the use of\ninternational assignees. In contrast to previous models on knowledge transfer in multinational Companies that\nhave been developed from a multilevel approach, we have used a microlevel approach in this article. We think\nthis is an appropriate way to conduct a specific inquiry into the examination of the phenomenon under study.\nThe success of knowledge transfer through international assignees depends primarily on the individual\nemployees taking part in the process. Accordingly, factors related to the abilities, motivation and quality of\nrelationship between the individual employees involved are the primary variables that need to be taken into\nconsideration. Of course, such a transfer will be embedded in a broader context including variables of multiple\nlevels of analysis (e.g. the institutional profile of a country and the strategic role of the recipient organization).\nIn this sense, our model is explicitly a partial explanation of the success of knowledge transfers through\ninternational assignees, complementary to other models that include other more general variables.\nThe model has both research and practical implications. Beginning with the research implications, it can serve\nas a basis for subsequent empirical research. Most of the constructs included in the model are established\nconstructs with valid and reliable measurement instruments - for example, abilities and motivation of local staff,\nhigh commitment work practices, and knowledge characteristics. Others (i.e. perceived reliability of\ninternational staff and motivation to transfer knowledge), however, have not been previously been reported.\nTherefore, some additional work will be required to develop valid measures.\nIn addition to providing a good foundation for future empirical testing, the model can be used for theory\ndevelopment as well. For example, drawing on a variety of HR research and theoretical perspectives, additional\nvariables favouring any of the three specified success factors for knowledge transfer could be detected and\nadded. As mentioned, the variables included in our model are the ones deemed most likely to affect the key\nsuccess factors, given what is currently known about the subject. Nothing precludes including additional\nvariables. Indeed, additional in-depth qualitative work is needed to explore the potential methods companies\nmight have developed to trigger the ability to effectively transfer knowledge via international employees.\nAs to the practical implications, the model can be used as a source of recommendations for companies to enable\nthem to overcome some of the potential difficulties and problems when knowledge is transferred to certain\ncountries through international assignees. These difficulties are very well documented. Knowing what factors\nmight impede or facilitate such transfers is of strategic importance for multinational companies. We hope our\nmodel helps to throw some light on this issue.\nReferences\nArgote, L. and Ingram, P.
