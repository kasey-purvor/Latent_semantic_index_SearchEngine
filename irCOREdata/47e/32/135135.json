Traditional meth-\nods for generating surfaces were initially mainly based\nupon interpolation algorithms. Recently, partial di\ufb00er-\nential equations (PDE) were introduced as a valuable\ntool for geometric modelling since they o\ufb00er a number\nof features from which these areas can bene\ufb01t. This work\nsummarises the uses given to PDE surfaces as a surface\ngeneration technique together with some other applica-\ntions to computer graphics.\nKeywords PDE surfaces \u00b7 Geometric modelling \u00b7 PDE\nmethod\n1 Introduction\nThe systematisation and characterization of certain sur-\nfaces dates as far back as the times of the Roman Empire.\nThey were interested in creating a mould for ship hulls\nsince their conquering aspirations demanded mass pro-\nduction of war vessels [23].

Nowadays, geometric design is aided by computa-\ntional tools where a large number of surfaces generation\ntechniques are readily available.\nThe majority of methods used in computer aided\ngeometric design for generating surfaces are commonly\nbased on a speci\ufb01c type of implicit surface, namely poly-\nnomial surfaces. This kind of surface is characterized by\na number of control points and weights. However, the\nmanipulation of such surfaces is not as straightforward\nas one would desire since the relationship between the\nchanges in geometry and the manipulation of the con-\ntrol points is not intuitive.\nParametric surfaces are in general easier to manip-\nulate than implicit ones since it is only necessary to\nmodify some of the parameters to obtain a di\ufb00erent sur-\nface. Parametric surfaces are commonly represented by\nsplines, which are a popular representation of curves in\ncomputer aided geometric design due to the advantages\nthey o\ufb00er, namely: the simplicity of their construction\nand the accuracy with which they can be evaluated.\n1.1 Common surface generation techniques for\ngeometric design\nToday, in the geometric design literature there exist nu-\nmerous methods for surface generations. In particular,\nspline-based techniques have become increasingly popu-\nlar over the years. A brief description of the most fre-\nquently occurring surface generation techniques is given\nbelow.\nB-splines are curves that can be described by a given\nset of points. This technique was originally based on\npolynomial interpolation through the complete set of\npoints. However, as high order polynomials are obtained\nfrom such a procedure, the resulting surfaces lacked smooth-\nness. Afterwards, in the interest of providing smoothness\nto such surfaces, piecewise interpolation was carried out.\nDe Casteljau and B\u00b4 ezier, both involved in automotive\ndesign, are the pioneers in the area [23]. The most com-2 Gabriela Gonz\u00b4 alez Castro et al.\nmon functions used to achieve piecewise interpolation\nwere third order polynomials and conics.\nThe most common types of spline used in computer\ndesigned are:\n\u2022 B\u00b4 ezier surfaces\nThese surfaces are a special case of Hermite inter-\npolation. They are constructed as a sequence of cu-\nbic segments rather than linear ones [32]. They are\ndetermined by,\nS(u, v)=\nm \u0001\nj=0\nn \u0001\nk=0\nPj,kBezj,m (v)Bezk,n(u) , (1)\nwhere Pj,k denote the control points and\nBezk,n =\nn!\nk!(n \u2212 k)!\nuk (1 \u2212 u)\nn\u2212k .\n\u2022 B-splines\nThese are a generalisationof B\u00b4 ezier curves where each\nof the control points is multiplied by its respective ba-\nsis function. The basis functions are determined by\na well established rule and depend on the number\nof knots (joining points) required. Thus, a B-spline\nsurface is de\ufb01ned by,\nS(u, v)=\nm \u0001\nj=0\nn \u0001\nk=0\nNi,p (u)Nj,q (v)Pj,k , (2)\nwhere Pj,k denote the control points, Ni,p and Ni,q\nare the B-spline basis functions of degree p and q\nrespectively. A B-spline basis function of degree r is\ngiven by,\nNi,r(u)=\nu \u2212 ui\nui+r\u22121 \u2212 ti\nNi,r\u22121 +\nui+k \u2212 u\nui+r \u2212 ui+1\nNi+1,r\u22121 ,\nwhere ui denotes a component of a pre-de\ufb01ned knot\nvector.\n\u2022 NURBS\nNon-Uniform Rational B-Splines di\ufb00er from B-splines\nand B\u00b4 ezier curves. The di\ufb00erence is that NURBS in-\nclude the weighting of the non-equidistant control\npoints, which is also the reason for which they are\nregarded as rational. These surfaces are mathemati-\ncally described by,\nS(u, v)=\n\u0002m\nj=0\n\u0002n\nk=0 Ni,p (u)Nj,q (v)wj,kPj,k\n\u0002m\nj=0\n\u0002n\nk=0 Ni,p (u)Nj,q (v)wj,k\n,\n(3)\nwhere wj,k represents the weight associated with the\ncontrol point Pj,k.\nThe most common types of parametric surfaces used\nin computer aided geometric design vary from rectangu-\nlar surfaces to Coons patches. A brief description of each\nof these types is given below. However, if the reader is\ninterested in further details, the work outlined in [23]\nwould be an excellent further reading since it is a self-\ncontained reference with a thorough description of each\nof the surface types mentioned in this work.\nRectangular surfaces, commonly known as tensor prod-\nuct surfaces, were based on bicubic spline interpolation\nin their early developments [23]. This type of surfaces,\nas its name points out, maps a rectangular domain into\na three-dimensional region.\nCoons patches are regarded as surfaces \ufb01tted through\na given set of four boundary curves. The only condition\nimposed on the boundary curves associated with a Coons\npatch surface is that these curves have to meet at the\npatch corners.\nTriangular surfaces take their name from the geo-\nmetric arrangement from where each of their points is\ncomputed. The domain is divided into triangular ele-\nments and then each point of the surface is evaluated\nat the barycentric coordinates of its respective triangu-\nlar element in the domain. This type of surface was \ufb01rst\nused in \ufb01nite element theory, where their formulation\nwas complicated and exhausting. However, the formula-\ntion of triangular patches in Bernstein form was more\nelegant [23].\nSubdivision is a surface generation technique aiming\nto \ufb01nd a smooth surface from a rough one. This tech-\nnique consists of an iterative process by which new points\nwithin the surface are found according to a given sub-\ndivision rule and, unlike parametric surfaces, they can\nrepresent surfaces with arbitrary topology [15]. However,\nsubdivision surfaces present some problems concerning\nthe absence of a mechanism by which inner collision can\nbe detected. Solution to some of these problems are pre-\nsented in De rose et al. [15].\nNevertheless, traditional surface generation techniques\nare not capable of guaranteeing global smoothness. Re-\ncently, this problem has been overcome by the introduc-\ntion of partial di\ufb00erential equations as a tool for surface\nmanipulation. Therefore, an overview containing some\nmathematical details concerning partial di\ufb00erential equa-\ntions, relevant to this work, is given below.\n1.2 Partial Di\ufb00erential Equations\nPartialdi\ufb00erential equations (PDE) are equations in which\nthe unknown function depends on a of set partial deriva-\ntives of this unknown function with respect to two or\nmore independent variables. For instance, let U(x,y)b e\nthe unknown function depending on two independent\nvariables x and y; then, the general form of a second\norder partial di\ufb00erential equation is given by,\nAUxx+BUxy+CUyy+DUx+EUy+FU = G(x,y), (4)A Survey of Partial Di\ufb00erential Equations in Geometric Design 3\nwhere A, B, C, D, E and F are all general functions of\nU(x,y), x and y and subscripts denote derivatives. Note\nthat Equation (4) contains terms with di\ufb00erent orders of\nderivatives.\nThe importance of such a mathematical tool is that\nalmost every physical phenomenon is modelled by a PDE.\nFor instance, the heat equation in either one or two\nspatial dimensions describes how heat is distributed in\na given length or area respectively. Other examples of\nPDEs describing physical phenomena are the wave equa-\ntion and the Laplace equation. Their use has also been\nextended to areassuch as \ufb01nance where the Black-Scholes\nequation models the variation of stock prices with time.\nPDEs can be classi\ufb01ed according to di\ufb00erent features\nsuch as:\n\u2013 Order. This is determined by the order of the highest\npartial derivative present in the equation.\n\u2013 Homogeneity. This feature classi\ufb01es PDEs as homo-\ngeneous and nonhomogeneous according to G(x,y). If\nthis term is identically equal to zero the PDE is said\nto be homogenous and otherwise is non-homogeneous.\n\u2013 Linearity. A PDE is said to be linear when the coef-\n\ufb01cients do not depend on U(x,y) and no derivative\nterm is multiplied by any other including itself. It is\nnonlinear otherwise.\nAdditionally, linear PDEs can be also classi\ufb01ed ac-\ncording to the type of coe\ufb03cients. Such a classi\ufb01cation\nis divided into three categories: parabolic, hyperbolic and\nelliptic. For instance, Equation (4) can fall into any of\nthese categories as follows:\n\u2013 Parabolic. The PDE must satisfy B2 \u2212 4AC =0 .\n\u2013 Hyperbolic. The equation falls into this category if\nB2 \u2212 4AC > 0.\n\u2013 Elliptic. The partial di\ufb00erential equation is regarded\nas such when B2 \u2212 4AC < 0.\nThis classi\ufb01cation extends to PDEs of higher order.\nHowever, the classi\ufb01cation criterion varies depending on\nthe order of the PDE. Additionally this classi\ufb01cation has\nbeen useful in characterizing the type of phenomenon\ndescribed by each class of equation.\nThe task of solving PDEs in general is not easy. How-\never, several methods have been developed for \ufb01nding\ntheir solution. These methods vary from purely analyt-\nical schemes to full numerical techniques. The methods\navailable for solving PDEs are beyond the scope of this\nwork and therefore, the reader is referred to [24] for fur-\nther details.\nNow, PDEs have been introduced to areas such as\ncomputer graphics and animation where they have been\ncapable of solving a variety of problems [45] very e\ufb03-\nciently. Furthermore, this mathematical tool has met the\never increasing demand of realism in the mentioned ar-\neas.\nThis work summarises all the aspects concerning the\nuse of PDEs as a surface generation technique and it is\ndivided as follows: Section 2 provides a brief description\nof PDE surfaces. Section 3 includes general information\nabout implicit PDE surfaces and lists the most common\nvelocity \ufb01elds used in computer aided geometric design.\nSection 4 describes parametric PDE surfaces and some\nof the methods available for producing them. Section 5\ndescribes some of the applications of PDEs in geometric\ndesign, in particular, in areas associated with computer\naided geometric design whereas some other applications\ngiven to PDEs in computer graphics are named in Sec-\ntion 6. Finally, Section 7 outlines the conclusions of this\nwork.\n2G e o m e t r i cP D Es u r f a c e s\nThe term PDE surfaces refers to surfaces that have been\ngenerated or modi\ufb01ed by the solution of a given par-\ntial di\ufb00erential equation. These surfaces are the graphi-\ncal representation of the solution to a given PDE subject\nto a set of boundary conditions. The advantages o\ufb00ered\nby the use of PDEs to generate surfaces over other sur-\nface generation techniques such as splines or NURBS are\nnumerous, namely:\n\u2013 Surface generation techniques based on PDEs require\na smaller number of parameters than spline-based\ntechniques to represent a given surface since PDE\nsurfaces are characterizedby a set of boundary curves,\nwhereas spline-based techniques are de\ufb01ned by a set\nof control points. Thus, PDE surfaces are more likely\nto be easier to manipulate than others.\n\u2013 PDE surfaces automatically guarantee some degree of\nintrinsic smoothness during blending processes, whereas\nsuch smoothness is not necessarily guaranteed when\nblending surfaces obtained when using spline-based\ntechniques. The smoothness obtained by blending PDE\nsurfaces increases with the order of the PDE giving\nrise to such a surface.\n\u2013 PDE-based surface generation techniques potentially\nunify geometric and physical aspects of surface mod-\nelling. This result is particularly useful for engineer-\ning design.\nThe type and order of the PDE to use is generally\nnot restricted. For instance, parabolic nonlinear PDEs\nof second, fourth and higher order have been used [45]\nwith the aim of describing the evolution of an initial sur-\nface subject to the chosen PDE. Notice that the degree\nof smoothness is determined by the order of the equa-\ntion. PDE surfaces comprise both implicit and paramet-\nric surfaces. Moreover, given the diversity of areas where\nPDE surfaces have been used, PDE surfaces can also be\nclassi\ufb01ed according to the problem they are aiming to\nsolve within the scope of computer-aided geometric de-\nsign. However, a simple and well de\ufb01ned classi\ufb01cation\ntaking into account both criteria simultaneously is very\ndi\ufb03cult to portray. Thus, a brief description of both im-\nplicit and parametric PDE surfaces is outlined in the4 Gabriela Gonz\u00b4 alez Castro et al.\nnext two sections, followed by a section entirely dedi-\ncated to describe the uses given to PDE surfaces in com-\nputer design.\n3 Implicit PDE surfaces\nImplicit PDE surfaces are those that result from an evo-\nlution equation for which its original domain is a pre-\nestablished surface; that is, these surfaces are generally\ncalculated as the collection of points p satisfying a given\ngeometric \ufb02ow [45]. The general representation of the\ngeometric \ufb02ow is determined by,\n\u2202p\n\u2202t\n= V (p, t) , (5)\nwhere V (p, t) denotes an arbitrary velocity \ufb01eld. It is\nimportant to stress that the initial surface for which the\ngeometric \ufb02ow is applied must be a closed and orientable\none. Thus, Equation (5) gives rise to a family of closed\nand orientable surfaces S (t) determined by,\n\u2202p\n\u2202t\n= N (p(t))Vn (k1,k 2,p) , (6)\nwhere p(t)i sap o i n ti nS (t), Vn (k1,k 2,p)a n dN (p)\nrepresent the normal velocity and vector of the surface\nat p respectively, whilst k1 and k2 denote the principal\ncurvatures of S (t).\nSeveral velocity \ufb01elds have been implemented for study-\ning di\ufb00erent problems present in computer aided geomet-\nric design such as surface blending, N-sided hole \ufb01lling,\nfree-form surface construction, noise reduction and im-\nage inpainting [45], [3], [4]. Examples of the most com-\nmon velocity \ufb01elds are listed below and, for the sake of\nbrevity, only the PDE associated with them is given. The\nuses of these velocity \ufb01elds will be discussed in a further\nsection.\nMean curvature \ufb02ow. This velocity \ufb02ow is described\nby,\nVn = \u22121\n2 (k1 + k2) .\nAveraged mean curvature \ufb02ow.T h i s\ufb02 o wi sg i v e n\nby,\nVn = 1\n2 (k1 + k2)+h(t),\nwhere\nh(t)=\nR\nS(t)\n1\n2(k1+k2)d\u03c3\nR\nS(t) d\u03c3 .\nSurface di\ufb00usion \ufb02ow. A fourth order velocity \ufb01eld\nis determined by,\nVn = \u22072 1\n2 (k1 + k2) ,\nwhere \u22072 represents the laplacian.\nHigher order geometric \ufb02ows. The general PDE\ndetermining such \ufb02ows is,\nVn =( \u22121)\nk+1 \u22072k 1\n2 (k1 + k2) ,\nwhere k \u2265 2.\nHeat \ufb02ow. This \ufb02ow is described by,\nVn =( \u22121)\nk+1 \u22072kp(t) ,\nwhere k>0a n dp(t)r e p r e s e n t sap o i n ti nS (t).\nWillmore \ufb02ow. This is a fourth order \ufb02ow given by,\nVn = \u22072 (k1 + k2)+2( k1 + k2)\n\u0003\n(k1 + k2)\n2 \u2212 K\n\u0004\n,\nwhere K represents the Gaussian curvature.\nThe usual approach for solving PDEs related to prob-\nlems in computer aided geometric design consists of using\n\ufb01nite di\ufb00erences. Details concerning the spatial and tem-\nporal discretisations together with the criteria applied to\nsome other aspects such as the evaluation of boundary\nconditions, mesh regularisation, stopping criteria and the\ngeneration of the initial mesh are exhaustively explained\nin [45].\nGenerally, the velocity \ufb01elds are geometry intrinsic;\ni.e., they are applicable to surfaces with arbitrary topol-\nogy. Additionally, these velocity \ufb01elds are volume pre-\nserving and in the vast majority of cases, they are area\nreducing. However, they are volume preserving if and\nonly if the surface to which they are applied is closed.\nTherefore, in the event of applying them to an open sur-\nface with a \ufb01xed boundary the area and volume preserv-\ning assertions stated before are not necessarily valid.\nSo far, implicit PDE surfaces result from the evolu-\ntion of PDEs through time; that is, parabolic PDEs have\nbeen discussed. However, implicit PDE surfaces can also\nbe obtained from elliptic PDEs [20]. A brief description\non how elliptic PDEs give rise to implicit PDE surfaces\nis given below, where the most relevant mathematical\ndetails are outlined.\n3.1 Accounting for the use of elliptic PDEs to obtain\nimplicit PDE surfaces\nThe use of elliptic PDEs for generating implicit surfaces\nwas introduced with the aim of taking advantage of the\npowerful parametric PDE formulation avoiding topolog-\nical restrictions [19]. This type of implicit surface is re-\ngarded as the solution to,\n\u0005\na\n2 \u22022\n\u2202x2 + b\n2 \u22022\n\u2202y2 + c\n2 \u22022\n\u2202z2\n\u00062\nX(x, y, z)=0 , (7)\nwhere x, y and z denote the coordinate system and vary\nf r o m0t o1w h e r e a sa, b and c represent shape control\nparameters inherent to the PDE.A Survey of Partial Di\ufb00erential Equations in Geometric Design 5\nIn principle, four boundary conditions are required to\nsolve Equation (7); however, analytic solutions, in gen-\neral, does not exist for solving it and numerical meth-\nods are used to obtain an approximation of the surface.\nFor example, standard \ufb01nite di\ufb00erences schemes are im-\nplemented to \ufb01nd the surface satisfying Equation (7).\nTherefore, the incorporation of additional constraints,\neither hard or \ufb02exible ones, is very straightforward since\nsuch constraints can be represented by additional alge-\nbraic equations that can be added to the original system\ninherent to the \ufb01nite di\ufb00erence representation of Equa-\ntion (7).\nThe work presented in [19] provides further mathe-\nmatical details of such a formulation together with some\nof its uses in computer aided design such as shape design,\nblending, reconstruction of surfaces from either curves\nor scattered points, sculpting, and the implementation\nof interactive tools.\n4 Parametric PDE surfaces\nParametric PDE surfaces are regarded as the solution to\nan elliptic partial di\ufb00erential equation in the paramet-\nric domain. This is an excellent surface generation tech-\nnique since the discretisation of the operator associated\nwith elliptic PDE is an averaging process of the solution\nneighbourhood of the PDE guaranteeing that the surface\nobtained will possess a certain degree of smoothness de-\npending upon the order of the PDE.\nParametric PDEs have proved to be extremely use-\nful for the implementation of surface generation meth-\nods and to address problems such as shape blending\n[5], optimisation [38], interactive design [41] and interac-\ntive sculpting [16]. Furthermore, the work presented in\n[6] shows that parametric PDE surfaces obtained from\nclosed analytic solutions to the generating PDE can be\nrepresented in terms of B-splines [6].\nFor the purposes of illustrating the most relevant\nmathematical details concerning the formulation of a\nparametric PDE surface, the Bloor-Wilson PDE method,\nwhich is a standard method for surface generation, is dis-\ncussed below.\n4.1 The Bloor-Wilson PDE method\nThe Bloor-Wilson PDE method has been developed in\n[10] and was originally introduced as a blending tool [5]\nfrom where its use has been extended to several other ar-\neas. This method is a surface generation technique over-\ncoming a number of problems inherent to polynomial\nsurfaces. Additionally, it is an excellent choice for free-\nform surface generation since it only requires boundary\ncurves as input, which can be determined in a very intu-\nitive manner [7]. A summarised description of the math-\nematical foundations of the Bloor-Wilson PDE method\nis outlined below.\nIn principle, there is no restriction upon the type and\norder of the PDE to be solved. However, elliptic PDEs\nhave been chosen to develop this technique since this\nkind of PDE is regardedas an averagingprocess through-\nout the entire surface. The order of the PDE determines\nthe smoothness of the surface since the boundary con-\nditions required to solve the PDE are usually given in\nterms of positional and derivative requirements.\nThe originalformulationof Bloor-WilsonPDE method\nconsists of producing a parametric surface X(u,v)b y\n\ufb01nding the solution to a PDE of the form,\n\u0005\n\u22022\n\u2202u2 + a2 \u22022\n\u2202v2\n\u0006r\nX(u,v)=0 , (8)\nwhere u and v represent the parametric surface coordi-\nnates, which are then mapped into the physical space;\ni.e., (x(u,v),y (u,v),z (u,v)), a is a parameter inherent\nto the PDE mostly restricted to a \u2265 1a n dr determines\nthe order of the PDE.\nEquation (8) is a PDE of order 2r. However, most\nof the work related to this method is based on fourth\norder PDEs; i.e., r = 2 and therefore four boundary con-\nditions are required. These are generally given by a set\nof two positional boundary conditions and the value of\nthe \ufb01rst derivative at the same positions. Notice that\nwhen a =1a n dr = 2, Equation (8) is known as the bi-\nharmonic equation, which models some phenomena oc-\ncurring within areas such as \ufb02uid and solid mechanics\nand therefore, many alternatives for solving it have been\ndeveloped.\nThe solution to Equation (8) can be found using dif-\nferent approaches, varying from analytical to fully nu-\nmerical ones. However, the selection of full analytical\nmethods gives rise to some topological restrictions on\nthe objects represented by this type of solution. A typ-\nical example of a PDE surface obtained by using the\nBloor-Wilson PDE method is presented in Figure 1. The\ngenerating boundary curves are shown in Figure 1.a, the\ntop and bottom circles represent the positional boundary\nconditions whereas the inner ones are used to calculate\nthe value of the derivative boundary conditions. The re-\nsulting PDE surface is outlined in Figure 1.b.\nThe former example shows, in a schematic manner, the\nfoundations of this method, enhancing the fact that only\nsome boundary curves are required to obtain a smooth\nsurface. However, the simplicity of the surface in this\nexample does not give an idea of the surface that can\nbe generated using this method. For this purpose, ad-\nditional examples of complex geometries are presented\nin Figure 2 and Figure 3. The PDE representation of\ntwo objects that can be mathematically characterizedare\nshown in Figure 2, where a PDE surface corresponding\nto a sea shell is schematized in Figure 2.a and a surface\nrepresentation of a Klein bottle is outlined in Figure 2.b.\nPDE surface representations of complex geometries are6 Gabriela Gonz\u00b4 alez Castro et al.\n(a) (b)\nFig. 1 Example of a PDE surface generated using the Bloor-\nWilson PDE method.

A representation of a dolphin is shown in (a) and a\nPDE surface representation of a face is shown in (b).\nIt is noteworthy to mention that when the domain is\nrestricted to 0 \u2265 u \u2265 1a n d0\u2265 v \u2265 2\u03c0,t h es o l u t i o n\nis also restricted to the use of periodic boundary condi-\ntions. The solution to Equation (8) can then be expressed\nin terms of a Fourier series. The full details of such a so-\nlution are presented in [10]. The Fourier series associated\nwith the solution of Equation (8) is in general an in\ufb01nite\nseries and therefore, the solution is approximate with the\nproperty of exactly satisfying the boundary conditions\nthrough the addition of a remainder term. However, the\nsolution is exact if all the boundary conditions can be\nexpressed in terms of a \ufb01nite Fourier series.\nAs for the case when the domain consists of the rect-\nangular region restricted by 0 \u2265 u \u2265 1a n d0\u2265 v \u2265 1,\nan eigenvalue solution has been developed. The mathe-\nmatical details of this solution are presented in [11].\nNotice that the method itself is not restricted to these\ncases since full numerical techniques such as \ufb01nite di\ufb00er-\nences or \ufb01nite element can be employed for \ufb01nding the\nsolution to Equation (8).\nFurthermore, the compatibility between surfaces gen-\nerated by the PDE method and the ones generated by\nmore traditional techniques such as B-splines and B\u00b4 ezier\nsurfaces has been thoroughly studied. Works such as [32]\nand [33] present B\u00b4 ezier solutions to elliptic PDEs. PDE\nsurfaces have also been shown to be compatible with B-\nspline representations [6].\n4.2 Alternatives to the Bloor-Wilson PDE method\nVariations of the PDE method formulated by Bloor and\nWilson have been accomplished. For instance, the work\npresented in [47] uses the following elliptic PDE,\n\u201e\na\n\u2202\n6\n\u2202u6 + b\n\u2202\n6\n\u2202u4\u2202v2 + c\n\u2202\n6\n\u2202u2\u2202v4 + d\n\u2202\n6\n\u2202v6\n\u00ab\nX(u,v)=0 , (9)\nwhere a, b, c and d are shape control parameters.\nThe solution to Equation (9) is similar to that pre-\nsented in [10] with the di\ufb00erence that the series is given\nin terms of a set of basis functions (this set is found ac-\ncording to the set of boundary conditions for each prob-\nlem in particular). This formulation o\ufb00ers three addi-\ntional shape control parameters, represented by a, b and\nc, which may be thought an improvement; however, the\nadded advantage of having such parameters is di\ufb03cult\nto assess since no physical meaning can be associated\nwith them. Equation (9) has also been used for blending\nsurfaces where curvature continuity is guaranteed [46].\n4.3 Parametric PDE surfaces obtained from\nphysics-based models\nThe imposition of energy constraints to parametric sur-\nfaces has proved useful in application where local and\nglobal deformations are required. Such constraints have\nbeen applied under a number of di\ufb00erent circumstances.\nSome examples of this are,A Survey of Partial Di\ufb00erential Equations in Geometric Design 7\n\u2013 B-spline surfaces have been sculpted interactively by\napplying linear constraints such as local pressures\nand sectional forces [13], [12].\n\u2013 Elasticity theory has been employed to manipulate\nsurfaces representing \ufb02exible materials, providing the\nmodel with more realism especially when such a model\nis used for animation purposes. The work presented\nin [37] shows di\ufb00erent examples whereby di\ufb00erent en-\nergy constraints have been imposed according to the\nelastic properties required by each example.\n\u2013 Geometric constraints have also been employed. Such\nconstraints are expressed as energy functions which\nare then responsible for parametrically deforming a\ngiven geometric model. Such a deformation may take\nplace either locally or globally, depending on the type\nof constraint employed [2], [44].\nElliptic PDEs have also been used for generating para-\nmetric PDE surfaces satisfying physics-based models where\nthe acceleration and velocity of the surface can be in-\ncluded so that the surface is allowed to deform accord-\ning to external forces [17]. This approach introduces new\ngeneral and \ufb02exible constraints; and, the system can be\nsolved using \ufb01nite di\ufb00erences. This technique has suc-\ncessfully achieved local and global deformations of PDE-\nbased surface models such as sculpting and blending [21].\nThis approach expands the topological limitations of the\noriginal formulation of the Bloor-Wilson PDE method.\nA nonlinear second order system of di\ufb00erential equa-\ntions describes the behaviour of a physics-based model,\nwhich in general form is given by,\nM\n\u22022X\n\u2202t2 + D\n\u2202X\n\u2202t\n+ KX = f, (10)\nwhere M, D and K account for the mass, damping and\nsti\ufb00ness matrices associated with the object respectively\nand f represent the total external force acting on the\nsurface.\nEquation (8) can be rewritten as,\nAX = g, (11)\nwhere A is the matrix associated with the \ufb01nite di\ufb00erence\nexpansion and g is vector. Thus, the dynamic version of\nthe surface is given by,\nM\n\u22022X\n\u2202t2 + D\n\u2202X\n\u2202t\n+( K + A)X = f + g. (12)\nAgain, semi-implicit \ufb01nite di\ufb00erence methods can be\nemployed to \ufb01nd the solution to Equation (12). Fur-\nther details concerning the physics-based formulation are\ngiven in [18].\nAnother type of physics-based parametric PDE sur-\nface is Dynamic NURBS, also known as D-NURBS. They\nare a generalisation of NURBS in which physical proper-\nties such as mass distribution, internal deformation en-\nergies and external forces are incorporated to the model.\nThis incorporation leads to solving a set of nonlinear dif-\nferential equations by integrating them numerically [35].\nThis type of PDE surfaces avoids the complications in-\nherent in the manipulation of standard NURBS, since\nthe designer is no longer required to manipulate control\npoints directly.\nVariationalgeometry formulations have also been used\nto produce parametric PDE surfaces [43] where di\ufb00er-\nent geometric constraints on the resulting surface can be\nimposed. These constraints are generally related to the\nsmoothness of the surface and are particularly useful in\nsurface fairing [29].\n5 Applications of PDE surfaces\nPDE surfaces have been successfully employed for devel-\noping techniques relevant to computer aided geometric\ndesign. Given the versatility with which PDE surfaces\ncan be formulated to address such techniques, there are\noccasions where more than one formulation is available\nfor solving a speci\ufb01c problem and in some cases, both im-\nplicit and parametric PDE surfaces can be employed in\nthe same given problem. Thus, the classi\ufb01cation of PDE\nsurfaces according to their use in computer aided geo-\nmetric design is given by providing a brief description of\nthe problem followed by the di\ufb00erent PDE formulations\ndeveloped so far addressing such a problem.\n5.1 Surface generation\nThe increasing demand of realism and real-time applica-\ntions in computer aided geometric design has resulted in\nthe constant development of e\ufb03cient surface generation\ntechniques. PDE surfaces have proven to be powerful in\nsuch tasks and given the versatility of this kind of sur-\nface, several techniques have been developed. Two are\nthe main areas where PDEs have been introduced as a\nsurface generation tool are interactive design (also known\nas free-form design) and blending.\n5.1.1 Interactive design\nComputer Aided Design (CAD) systems can bene\ufb01t from\ninteractive design tools based on PDE formulations where\nthe main control of the surface is gained through the\nmanipulation of the boundary conditions. An important\nremark must be made stressing that the user requires\nno familiarity with the mathematical details concerning\nPDEs since the user is only required to de\ufb01ne the bound-\nary conditions in terms of curves. Both implicit and para-\nmetric PDE surfaces have been used as the foundations\nof tools promoting interactive design.\nImplicit PDE surfaces arising from elliptic PDEs have\nbeen used in [19] where either scattered points, cross-\nsectional or sketch curves outlining the rough shape of8 Gabriela Gonz\u00b4 alez Castro et al.\nthe object are chosen as boundary conditions. Addition-\nally, [19] presents graphical examples obtained for these\nthree types of boundary conditions.\nParametric PDE surfaces have also been used for in-\nteractive design purposes. The PDE method formulated\nby Bloor and Wilson has served as the foundation for\nthe development of surface generation interactive tools.\nThe work presented in [28] uses a sixth order elliptical\nPDE for this purpose and gives a detailed explanation\nregarding the mathematics inherent in the method. For\ninstance, the procedure by which the required derivative\nconditions are obtained is outlined. Given that this in-\nteractive tool has been designed assuming that the user\npossesses no mathematical background, the user is re-\nquired to generate six boundary curves from which the\ninteractive tool calculates the required derivatives. Free-\nform generation examples of objects such as a ship hull,\na phone handset and a marine propeller are discussed in\n[7] where explicit mathematical functions determine the\nboundary conditions.\n5.1.2 Shape blending\nShape blending refers to the process by which two or\nmore surface patches are joined. This process must be\ncarried out in a way such that a certain degree of smooth-\nness is achieved at the regions where these patches join.\nPDEs o\ufb00er a natural approach for addressing this prob-\nlem. The degree of smoothness is determined by the order\nof the PDE in use.\nParabolic PDEs have been used for surface blending,\nobtaining excellent results. For instance, the work out-\nlined in [45] presents the results of blending three cylin-\nders at di\ufb00erent angles. Three di\ufb00erent velocity \ufb01elds\nhave been used to carry out the blending process namely:\nmean curvature \ufb02ow, fourth and sixth order \ufb02ows. These\nresults are clearly illustrated by the graphical results.\nHowever a number of parameters are necessary to achieve\nthese results.\nBy contrast, the blending properties of the Bloor-\nWilson PDE method are such that the only requirement\nto achieve a fast and smooth blend between two surface\npatches is either a common boundary condition at the\njoining region or a boundary condition lying on one of\nthe surface patches itself. Works such as [5], [30] describe\nthe use of this PDE method for achieving smooth blends.\nThe reader is referred to [5] where several examples of\nsecond, fourth and mixed order blends are detailed that\nare easy to reproduce.\nThe alternative formulation of the Bloor-Wilson PDE\nmethod has also been used for surface blending [46] where\na sixth order elliptic PDE has been chosen for accom-\nplishing such a purpose. Comparisons between closed-\nform solutions and the one proposed in this work are\nshown together with some interesting examples, one of\nwhich involves the blending of a wrinkled surface wtih a\nconic section.\n5.2 Surface processing\nAnother major category in which the use of PDE sur-\nfaces in computer aided geometric design is surface pro-\ncessing. The phenomena falling into this category are\nthose concerning the total or partial enhancing of an al-\nready existing surface. Image inpainting, noise reduction,\nN-sided hole \ufb01lling and surface fairing are some of the\nmost relevant processes.\n5.2.1 Image inpainting\nImage inpainting is de\ufb01ned as the technique of modify-\ning an image in an unnoticeable manner. Implicit PDE-\nbased methods have been adopted for such purpose. In\nparticular, Willmore-type \ufb02ows have been used in [4].\nThis work presents some examples illustrating how this\ntechnique has been successfully employed to remove un-\nwanted objects from pictures. However, there are some\nrestrictions on the size of the region where this technique\nis applied when the texture of such a region needs to be\npreserved.\n5.2.2 Noise reduction\nNoise reduction is another area where PDE surfaces have\nbeen used. In particular, parabolic PDEs giving rise to\nimplicit PDE surfaces have proved to be a useful tool for\nreducing noise whilst preserving the image details. Ex-\namples of some noise-reducing surface di\ufb00usion \ufb02ows are\npresented in [3] where two approaches for the problem\nare outlined. The \ufb01rst of these approaches consists of us-\ning an isotropic di\ufb00usion \ufb02ow; i.e. the \ufb02ow acts uniformly\nalong every direction. The graphical example associated\nwith this \ufb02ow illustrates how the noise within a\ufb00ected ar-\neas is gradually removed. The second approach exploits\nthe advantages of anisotropic di\ufb00usion \ufb02ows, which act\ndi\ufb00erently along di\ufb00erent directions. Again, it can be ap-\npreciated how the noise is removed leaving the details of\nthe image una\ufb00ected. Di\ufb00usion \ufb02ows are also used in [31].\nHowever, these \ufb02ows are used for mapping noisy images\ninto three-dimensional implicit surfaces. The work pre-\nsented in [1] is another example on how anisotropic di\ufb00u-\nsion is used as a noise reduction tool. The latter is capa-\nble of smoothing surface successfully whilst noise is also\nreduced, which is particularly useful in cases where the\nsurface is generated from un\ufb01ltered or corrupted data.\n5.2.3 N-sided hole \ufb01lling\nThe problems of N-sided hole \ufb01lling consists of construct-\ning a surface to \ufb01ll such a hole with speci\ufb01c continuity re-\nquirements at the boundary. Velocity \ufb01elds such as mean\ncurvature \ufb02ow, fourth and sixth order \ufb02ows have been\nemployed to construct implicit PDE surfaces, aiming to\n\ufb01ll such holes successfully. An example to this e\ufb00ect isA Survey of Partial Di\ufb00erential Equations in Geometric Design 9\npresented in [45] where the nose of a human face is recon-\nstructed. As expected, the results obtained by the sixth\norder \ufb02ow are the smoothest.\n5.2.4 Surface fairing\nSurface fairing accounts for the process of generating\nfree-form surfaces satisfying aesthetics requirements. Im-\nplicit PDE surfaces resulting from second and fourth or-\nder \ufb02ows have been employed in [36] providing an ex-\ncellent example of an algorithm for smoothing arbitrary\ntriangular meshes. This algorithm uses a fourth order ve-\nlocity \ufb01eld. Each of the steps considered in the algorithm\nis outlined and the examples presented show the poten-\ntial of the technique. For the interested readers in the\npragmatic mathematical details of the implicit PDE for-\nmulation, this work is highly recommended as a further\nreading.\n5.3 Design analysis and optimisation\nGeometric PDE surfaces o\ufb00er a natural environment for\ndeveloping tools capable of carrying out design analysis\nand optimisation based on the physical properties inher-\nent to a speci\ufb01c problem. The process of optimising the\nshape of an object involves a target function establish-\ning the requirements to be ful\ufb01lled. This target function\nis given in terms of a set of design parameters that are\niteratively changed until the target function is satis\ufb01ed.\nFurthermore, PDE-based optimisation formulations\npresent a signi\ufb01cant time reduction when compared to\nother optimisation techniques available. Examples of the\nprogress achieved by using PDE surfaces in these areas\nare presented in [27] [14], [9], [42] and [38], all of which\nare based on the Bloor-Wilson PDE method.\n5.3.1 Design analysis\nDesign analysis as such is carried out in [27], [14] and [9]\nwhere parameters characterizing a given speci\ufb01c object\nare found. For instance, [27] and [9] focus on the extrac-\ntion of parameters characterizing aircraft geometry. The\nformer aims to extract the design geometry from a given\ngeometry, whereas the latter illustrates the changes of\ngeometry by changing some of the design parameters.\nThe work presented in [14] portrays the characterization\nof a marine propeller using a small set of parameters\nand a sixth order version of the Bloor-Wilson PDE for-\nmulation. Emphasis must be made that these works ma-\nnipulate the set of parameters de\ufb01ning each object for\npurposes of illustration.\nThe work presented in [8] portrays another applica-\ntion related to design analysis. The Bloor-Wilson PDE\nmethod is employed here to visualise the physical proper-\nties or functional performance of a given object. Temper-\nature and stress distributions are some of these proper-\nties. Here, the target function mathematically describes\nthe physical property of interest and no change is made\nto the set of design parameters.\n5.3.2 Optimisation\nBy contrast, optimisation processes are required to sat-\nisfy a target function and thus the manipulation of the\ndesign parametersis oriented towards this purpose. Again,\nthe method formulated by Bloor and Wilson has proved\nto be useful for such purposes as shown in [42] and [38].\nIn particular, [42] presents an example with biological\napplications. This example predicts stable structures of\nvesicles by using the surface energy of the membrane\nas the target function. Industrial applications have also\nbeen found. For example, the work presented in [38] de-\nscribes the optimal design of yoghourt containers where\ntheir thickness is minimised subject to constraints on the\nstress distribution around the walls of the container.\n5.4 Other applications\nThere are a number of applications that uses PDE sur-\nfaces. However, given the nature of such applications,\ntheir classi\ufb01cation is not a trivial exercise. Among such\napplications are subdivision, geometric manipulations and\nanimation.\n5.4.1 Subdivision\nAlternative surface generation techniques such as sub-\ndivision can also bene\ufb01t from the versatility o\ufb00ered by\nPDE surfaces. Subdivision is a surface generation tech-\nnique by which an original set of points de\ufb01ning a rough\nshaped object is modi\ufb01ed by adding additional surface\npoints according to a given subdivision rule. In spite of\npresenting a certain degree of smoothness, subdivision\nsurfaces lack collision detection mechanisms and in some\ncases this leads to unwanted overlapping from which\ntopological restrictions are imposed [15]. Implicit PDE\nsurfaces have been employed to address this problem and\nthus several velocity \ufb02ows have been tried. Gaussian cur-\nvature, surface di\ufb00usion, and Willmore \ufb02ows have been\ntried in [45] for addressing this problem. This work out-\nlines the necessary mathematical background together\nwith some graphical examples where the di\ufb00erent \ufb02ows\nare employed to evolve the surfaces after subdividing the\nsurface one.\nParametric surfaces have also been employed in sub-\ndivision processes. For instance, the work presented in\n[15] presents an alternative for modelling the dynamics\nof clothes in animation where an energy functional is\nproposed and \ufb01nite element techniques are used to \ufb01nd\nthe solution.10 Gabriela Gonz\u00b4 alez Castro et al.\n5.4.2 Animation\nAnimation is an area where PDE surfaces are potentially\nuseful. Processes such as morphing, facial expression and\nmovement are some of the processes that can directly\nbene\ufb01t from their use. One of the reasons why PDE sur-\nfaces represent a powerful mechanism for overcoming the\nlimitations inherent to these problems is the number of\nparameters describing a given PDE surface is relatively\nsmall. A mathematical characterization of such a process\ncan be obtained through the manipulation of the PDE\nor its boundary conditions.\nAs mentioned before, cloth dynamics in animation\nhas been modelled in [15]; however, this approach does\nnot take full advantage of the PDE formulation.\nMorphing refers to the process by which an object\nis transformed into another and, in the vast majority of\ncases, this process is required to take place as smoothly\nand aesthetically as possible. Parametric PDE surfaces\nare especially useful for such purposes since objects are\nbasically determined by a set of boundary conditions.\nThus, a suitable parameterised combination of the bound-\nary conditions of the two objects to be morphed will\nlead to a smooth and fast transition between the objects.\nThe Bloor-Wilson PDE method in particular o\ufb00ers some\nother alternatives when restricted to the periodic case.\nThe mathematical characterization of the movement\nof an object in animation will signi\ufb01cantly reduce time\nand work involved in such a process. Again, the Bloor-\nWilson PDE method is regarded as an excellent choice to\naccomplish this purpose. Both morphing and character-\nization of movement can take advantage of mathemat-\nical properties inherent to the solution of Equation (8)\nrestricted to the exclusive use of periodic boundary con-\nditions where the resulting PDE surfaces are character-\nized by the spine. Mathematically speaking, the spine of\na surface is a curve described by a polynomial function,\nwhich can be thought as the skeleton of the PDE surface\n[39]. The spine of a PDE surface has been proved to be\na powerful tool for geometric manipulations of the entire\nsurface [40].\n6 Other aspects of computer graphics related to\nPDEs\nComputer graphics industry has recently been highly in-\nterested in the simulation of natural phenomena since\nthe increasing demand for special e\ufb00ects concerning the\nmovement of smoke, water and \ufb01re among others have\nposed some interesting problems. The physics associated\nwith these phenomena are described by very complicated\nPDEs for which only elaborate and time-consuming nu-\nmerical solutions are available. Thus, the task of simulat-\ning such phenomena in computer graphics is not a sim-\nple one since the PDE associated with a particular phe-\nnomenon has to be simpli\ufb01ed so that a certain amount of\nrealism is kept, solved in virtually real time and properly\napplied to the graphics environment. Level set methods\nhave proved useful in addressing these problems. [25].\n6.1 Water\nOne of the greatest challenges in computer graphics is\nthe animation of water or other liquids. The speci\ufb01c sce-\nnarios where such animation may take place vary from\ncascades to pouring liquids into transparent containers.\nThe key feature to achieve this kind of modelling consists\nof accurately separating the liquid from the air. A solu-\ntion to this problem is presented in [22]. An approach\ncalled the particle level set method has been employed\nwhere the front of the water surface is thickened. For\nthe sake of brevity, the reader is referred to this work\nif he or she is interested in details of the mathematical\nformulation. The results obtained by this technique are\nillustrated by examples in which a glass is \ufb01lled with\nwater, achieving an acceptable degree of realism.\n6.2 Smoke\nRealistic modelling of smoke is still regarded as a com-\nplex and challenging problem due to the complex nature\ninherent in the motion of gases. Computer-based \ufb02uid\ndynamics algorithms which enable to model such a phe-\nnomenon that can be modi\ufb01ed and adapted to computer\ngraphics and animation are already available in the liter-\nature. The work described in [26] outlines an algorithm\nthat uses Euler equations for inviscid incompressible \ufb02u-\nids and solves them using a technique called vorticity\ncon\ufb01nement, which is extensively found in computer \ufb02uid\ndynamics literature. This technique is capable of retain-\ning the short-scale features inherent in smoke, such as\nrolling features.\n6.3 Fire\nThe intrinsically dangerous nature of \ufb01re is one of the\nreasons for which its modelling is constantly being im-\nproved. Combustion processes are characterized by the\nexpansion of fuel, which is responsible for the turbulence\nassociated with this process. The method proposed in\n[34] uses a dynamic implicit surface to represent the re-\naction zone, where the thin \ufb01lm approximation produces\nacceptable visual results. The reader is referred to [34]\nfor further details where the modelling of this process in-\nvolves several stages which require careful consideration.\n7 Conclusions\nThis work presents a synopsis of the uses given to par-\ntial di\ufb00erential equations in areas related to computerA Survey of Partial Di\ufb00erential Equations in Geometric Design 11\naided geometric design. PDEs are a very powerful tool\nin geometric design since some degree of smoothness is\nguaranteed, depending on the order of the PDE gener-\nating or modifying a surface. PDE surfaces are mainly\nclassi\ufb01ed as implicit or parametric PDE surfaces. Im-\nplicit PDE surfaces are generallyobtained from parabolic\nPDEs whereas parametric PDE surfaces are associated\nwith elliptic ones.\nA brief description of some of the \ufb02ows employed to\n\ufb01nd implicit PDE surfaces together with the problems\neach of these \ufb02ows address has been given. The latter\nvary from surface generation to noise reduction and fair-\ning. As far as parametric PDE surfaces are concerned,\nthe Bloor-Wilson PDE method, which is based on the\nsolution to an elliptic PDE, has proved to be a powerful\ntool for interactive surface generation since a very small\nnumber of parameters is required to characterize the sur-\nface. Alternative formulations to the Bloor-Wilson PDE\nmethod have been presented where physics-based models\nhave been incorporated.\nElliptic PDEs have also been used to generate im-\nplicit PDE surfaces with the aim of taking advantage\nof the parametric PDE formulation without any restric-\ntions on the topology of the object to be created. How-\never, numerical techniques are likely to be used to \ufb01nd\ntheir solution.\nPDEs have also been used for addressing other prob-\nlems related to surfaces in computer graphics. The graph-\nical modelling of natural phenomena such as water, smoke\nand \ufb01re is not a simple task since the PDE equations\nmodelling these phenomena in the real world are very\ncomplicated. Thus, the aim is to simplify these equa-\ntions so that they can be solved rapidly and accurately\nenough to preserve the realism with which these phe-\nnomena behave.\nPDEs are powerful tools for applications related to\ngeometric modelling. These limitations are directly asso-\nciated with the mathematical challenges related to the\nstability and accuracy of numerical PDEs together with\nthe speed with which such solutions can be obtained.\nAdditionally, like polynomial surfaces, most PDE meth-\nods generate parametric surfaces and therefore problems\ninherent to parametric representation of surfaces can be\nconsidered as limitations. For example it is di\ufb03cult to\nrepresent objects with arbitrary topology using paramet-\nric PDEs.\nThe introduction of PDEs to computer aided geo-\nmetric design has occurred fairly recently and therefore\ntheir full potential remains to be fully exploited, o\ufb00er-\ning further lines of investigation where the mathematical\nproperties of PDEs can be fully used.\nAcknowledgements The authors wish to acknowledge the\nsupport received from the UK Engineering and Physical Sci-\nences Research Council through the grants EP\/C015118\/1\nand EP\/D000017\/1 by which this work has been endeav-\noured.\nReferences\n1.
