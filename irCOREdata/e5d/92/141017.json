The paper sets out the \nchanges in UK requirements, summarised in a Framework provided by the Worshipful Company of \nMarketors, and company practice.  The two weakest areas in relation to the Accounting Standards \nBoard Reporting Standard are the provision of forward looking information and non-financial KPIs, \nespecially those to do with customers, competitors and brands.

Accordingly, \nprovision of professional measures of brand equity should go some way towards solving both \nweaknesses at the same time.  \n \n \n1 Senior Fellow, London Business School and Professor, Cranfield School of Management, respectively. \n  2\n                                                \nTwo of the global pressures on company reporting are for greater transparency and better narrative \nreporting.  In an era where intangible assets are increasing dominating, in value terms, the tangible \nassets, the formal accounts are becoming less reliable indicators of the company\u2019s trading and \nfinancial position. Enron marked a watershed.  The accounts were misleading but, and this is \ndebatable, technically correct. They weaved around the detailed rules for accounts and the \ninformation would have been insufficient.  Greater transparency is needed and is being demanded \nby regulators in the EU, USA, Japan and elsewhere.2  Given the limitations of formal accounting, \nthese demands have to be met through the narrative sections of company annual reports.  \nTerminology varies and the Chairman\u2019s Report, Business Review, Director\u2019s Report or Operating \nand Financial Review is called the narrative report in this article. \n \nThe developments in the UK, which pioneered the mandatory publication of the balance sheet back \nin 1906, has implications for other developed countries especially in a world where reporting \npractices are converging and companies are multinational.  Much of the recent UK development, for \nexample, has been driven by the EU Directive on company reporting in 2003. \n \nA formal OFR (Operating and Financial Review) was mooted by the UK government in 2005 but \nwas deemed burdensome and replaced by a less formal requirement for a Business Review.  In \npractice, the detailed requirements remained much the same.  Some companies were sufficiently far \ndown the line when the requirement was withdrawn that they have retained the OFR terminology.  \n \nThis article sets out the broad requirements for the narrative sections of UK annual reports.  We \nthen review the advantage to companies from greater transparency and how companies themselves \nare changing their practices in that direction.  Key areas of difficulty are the provision of non-\nfinancial Key Performance Indicators (KPIs or metrics) and forward-looking information.  Of \ncourse the key question is whether these developments represent measured behavioural change or \nwhether they are merely good intent.  We review results from the quantitative scoring of narrative \nsections of annual reports against the Accounting Standards Board (ASB) guidelines.   Whatever \nthe rights and wrongs of the provision of forward-looking information, the solution may lie in the \nprovision of current and historical market metrics since they predict future outcomes.  These strands \nare brought together as conclusions. \n \n \nWhat should narratives contain? \n \nThe UK Government and the Companies Act 2006 have largely delegated to the ASB the \nspecification of narrative sections of annual reports.  The specification is mainly advisory (\u201cbest \npractice\u201d) rather than mandatory.  This is wise: businesses differ too widely to allow \nstandardisation.  What is crucial for one company is not important for another.  Furthermore, it \nseems better to promote the benefits of transparency than create legal requirements for companies to \nweave their way around. \n \n \n2  For a fascinating long-term review see \u201cU.S. Accounting Standards and Their Environment: A Dualistic \nStudy of Their 75 Years of Change,\u201d a lecture by Professor Yuji Ijiri, to the US Accounting Standards \nBoard and Financial Accounting Standards Board, also in Journal of Accounting and Public Policy, 24(4, \nJuly-August), 2005, 255-279  \n \n  3\n                                                \nThus the ASB issues a \u201cReporting Standard\u201d and reports on compliance with that Standard.  As the \ncurrent Reporting Standard has 69 pages, and government and leading consultancies have issues \nhundreds of other pages of advice, there is a need for a brief aide-memoire for those who have to \nprepare narrative reports.  A City of London Livery Company, the Worshipful Company of \nMarketors, supported by the Marketing Society and the Chartered Institute of Marketers, has \ntherefore provided a synopsis.  The first edition, the \u201cChecklist\u201d, was published in September 2005 \nwith eight pages but that was found to be too abbreviated, and a second edition, the \u201cFramework\u201d, \npublished December 2007, has 12.  Copies of the Framework can be feely downloaded from \nwww.marketors.org. \n \nThe underlying principle of the new narrative reporting guidelines is that it should \u201cset out an \nanalysis of the business through the eyes of the board of directors\u201d3.  If a Business Review provides \nless than the full picture, two conclusions may be drawn: the Board itself has only a partial \nunderstanding of their business and\/or they are failing to comply with the guidelines.  \nConfidentiality is widely cited as a reason for non-compliance, especially in respect of KPIs.  \nUndoubtedly some topics and metrics are confidential in the sense that their publication would harm \nthe company\u2019s competitiveness.  There is also the inherent unfairness of UK PLCs being expected \nto be transparent while private companies, notably private equity, and foreign competitors are not.  \nNevertheless, some 80% of details withheld on grounds of confidentiality proved not to be when \ntested against \u201cwould this information give your competitors advantage against you, i.e. would they \nbe interested?\u201d4  Competitors do similar market research and already know most of what they want \nto know. \n \nBut that is only true for past data.  The ASB Reporting Standard lays great emphasis on the \nprovision of forward-looking information, i.e. what the company will do and the likely \nconsequences.  Business plans really are confidential and some see no reason why they should be \nexposed.  Broad statements of strategy and intent may not be competitively sensitive but by that \nvery measure they are not informative.  Boilerplate helps no one.  It is hard to understand why the \nidea of providing meaningful forward-looking information has so much traction.  Competitive \nadvantage depends on surprise. \n \nOthers disagree.  The US Securities and Exchange Commission shifted its view from plan historical \nfacts to the provision of forecasts in the 1970s.5 Companies are pressed by analysts and major \ninvestors to supply forward looking information and, to some extent, do so.  Where they meet those \nrequests, they should certainly publish the information also to all shareholders in the narrative \nreports. \n \nGiven these divisions of opinion, it is no surprise that, the lack of provision of forward-looking \ninformation is perhaps the largest area where practice does not accord with ASB guidelines.  We \nwill suggest a solution later in this paper. \n \nOne compromise has been achieved.  Directors pointed out that they could be arraigned if they \nprovided forward-looking information in good faith but things worked out differently.  The \ngovernment initially rejected \u201csafe harbour\u201d provisions to cover this problem but relented at a late \n \n3 ASB Reporting Standard (2006), para 4. \n4 Tim Ambler, Patrick Barwise and Chris Higson (2001) Market metrics: What should we tell the \nshareholders?

At least directors will not now go to gaol if they \nare candid. \n \nThe Framework used for scoring narrative reporting practice relative to the ASB Reporting \nStandard is set out as Figure 1. \n \nFigure 1: Narrative Framework\nContext, Nature, Objectives & Strategies\nMarkets served, e.g. current size and future prospects\nCompetitive position in markets served and future prospects, e.g. market share, ranking or position\nExternal factors likely to impact future prospects, e.g. legal, regulatory, technological, economic, social, \nenvironmental\nCorporate objectives: financial and non-financial, quantitative and qualitative goals with some indication of \ntimetable\nEconomic or business model: how the business adds value, sources and usage of cash flow\nStrategic expansion\/contraction, e.g. diversifying or changing geographic markets served, product categories \nor customer types\nKPIs\/metrics most used by the board to assess progress\/performance: both financial and non-financial\n \nDrivers of Development & Performance \nSources of cash flow, e.g. profile of customers, number of end users\/consumers, loyalty, churn, penetration, \nshare of wallet, and user consumer attitudes, e.g. satisfaction, perceived quality, intention to purchase \nTrade or channel relations (where applicable), e.g. service levels, distribution, display, trade customer \nsatisfaction\nFacilities, subsidiaries, markets served and distribution methods: key changes with impact on future cash \nflow\nCompetitive effects and performance relative to competitors, e.g. market share, relative pricing\nDrivers likely to improve future prospects, e.g. marketing expenditure, sales force changes\nDrivers likely to reduce future prospects, e.g. costs, impact of regulations\nInnovation, e.g. number of new products, new products\u2019 revenue and margin as share of total, R&D \ninvestment\nKey strengths and resources, e.g. reputation, brand equity, intellectual property, employees, capabilities, \ndiversity\nPrincipal risks and uncertainties, e.g. how key internal and external risks are being addressed\nRelationships with other stakeholders: which are most important, why?, implications, risks for cash flow\n \nFinancial Position analysis and explanations\nAccounting policies, e.g. those necessary to understand the performance and financial position, changes\nCapital structure: nature, rationale, short\/longer-term plans\nTreasury policies: analysis and explanation of cash-related matters \nCash flows, e.g. probable cash requirements, where segmental cash flows are out of line with profits\nLiquidity, e.g. working capital, current assets, current and prospective borrowing requirements\nProfitability, e.g. sales volume, turnover, gross margins, profit ratios\n \n \nCompanies find compliance with the first section, which is largely in the public domain anyway, \nand the third section, which amplifies the accounts, fairly straightforward.  As the ASB review of \n  5\n2006 reports showed, the middle one presents the problems.  The ASB review was based on their \nown analysis, supplemented by five independent studies.6\n \nWe now consider the benefits to companies from greater transparency before returning to the \nquestion of how practice is developing and the problem areas, notably marketing. \n \nThe benefits of transparency \n \nCompanies are more likely to embrace the spirit of the ASB Reporting Standard if they see \nadvantage in so doing.  Otherwise they will do the minimum needed to keep out of trouble.  Black \nSun, a consultancy that specialises in helping companies with their annual reports, sponsors \nresearch exploring this issue.  Two London Business School students7, as part of this activity, tested \nwhether increased transparency in narrative reporting has led to an improvement in the following \nareas:  \n1. Performance Management  \n2. Risk Management \n3. Internal Coordination and Communication   \n4. Strategic Development  \n5. Investor Relations. \n \nAs one would expect, there were wide differences of opinion, but on average, respondents claimed \nthat their companies benefited from providing increased transparency in annual report narratives in \nall the above respects except strategic development.  The Mediratta and Jain Table 1 is reproduced \nbelow: \n \nTable 1: Summary Results \n \nPercentage of respondents who reported a benefit from increased transparency in the narrative on \na particular dimension \nDimension Agree Disagree Neither \nPerformance Management 76% 24% - \nRisk Management 66% 34% - \nInternal Coordination and Communication 76% 12% 12% \nStrategic Development  41% 59% - \nInvestor Relations 92% 4% 4% \n \n \n                                                 \n6  ASB.

Likewise, risk will probably \nbe better managed or at least more considered if one has to explain oneself.  The third one is \nespecially interesting.  Companies are often criticised for not keeping employees informed about the \nmain corporate issues.  Those that fully report to shareholders, however, find it relatively simpler to \nrelay the same information to employees. \n \nGaining competitive advantage and how that can be achieved is something, as noted above, that \ncompanies may well wish to keep under wraps.  Publicity can only rarely help that.  One example is \npre-announcing a new model which can deter competitors from similar launches.  Few such \nopportunities arise. In the light of this, it is perhaps surprising that as many as 41% agreed that \ntransparency was helpful in this respect. \n \nOn the other hand, the benefits of transparency for investor relations are the most obvious \nattractions and likely to top most lists.  Marketing the company to existing and potential \nshareholders should encourage them to buy more shares and at higher prices.  A large part of that is \nunderstanding the needs of shareholders and especially the need for honest and open \ncommunications. \n \n  \nBut are company practices actually changing? \n \nAccording to the ASB Report referenced above, companies generally meet the legal reporting \nrequirements (\u201ccompliance\u201d) but fall short in some of the \u201cbest practice\u201d areas.  They did not \ncompare progress year on year but this will presumably follow in due course.  Among their \nconclusions were (pp.2-3): \n \n\u201cAreas of good reporting \n\u2022 Companies are generally good at providing descriptions of their business and markets, \ntogether with their strategies and objectives, although some improvements can be made in \nproviding information on their external environment. \n\u2022 All companies within the sample are providing satisfactory or better descriptions of the \ncurrent development and performance of the business. \n\u2022 There has been an increase in companies reporting environmental, employee and social \nissues, although very few companies have discussed their contractual arrangements and \nrelationships in any depth. \n \nAreas for improvement \n\u2022 The greatest area of difficulty for companies when producing their narrative reports is the \ndisclosure of forward-looking information. The proposed \u2018safe harbour\u2019 provisions in the \nCompanies Act 2006 may encourage companies to provide greater detail moving forward. \n\u2022 Companies need to think carefully about the description of the resources available to the \nentity, in particular on those intangible items not reflected in the balance sheet.\u201d \n \nThese, then, are the two negatives: lack of forward-looking information and specifics on brand \nequity, which for many if not most companies is by far their most valuable asset but not one that \nappears on the balance sheet.  The next section will consider whether providing brand equity \nmetrics resolves the issue about forward-looking information, since brand equity is a proxy for \n  7\n                                                \nfuture cash flows.  Before turning to this topic, however, we will review some additional data on \ndisclosure. \n \nPricewaterhouseCoopers however showed remarkable developments in narrative reporting in their \nNarrative Reporting Survey 2007 (figures from a survey a year earlier in parentheses):8\n\u2022 \u201c93% (66%) of companies provide some disclosure around their strategic objectives.  \n\u2022 75% (19%) of companies clearly disclose their KPIs.  \n\u2022 75% (22%) of companies clearly set out what they consider to be their principal risks and \nuncertainties.\u201d \n \nOn the other hand: \n\u2022 \u201cOnly 35% of companies support their strategic statements with targets, qualitative or \nquantitative. \n\u2022 Only 42% of companies clearly align their KPIs with their strategic priorities. And when \npresented these tend to be financial in nature.\u201d \n \nEven with the qualifications, this is a rapid increase in practice.  Some of their figures are supported \nby Black Sun research:9\n\u2022 \u201c98% of companies now clearly communicate strategy, with over three quarters of \ncompanies now providing objectives and business targets, up from 40% 12 months ago. \n\u2022 88% of companies include information on market trends and 43% include independent data \nto help improve understanding.\u201d \n \nIn reviewing the position from an entirely different perspective, Peter Montagnon10, representing \nmajor investors, was not quite so sanguine.  He did not accept that all companies are producing \nKPIs that are helpful; and some were not producing many or any non-financial ones, although he \nexpected that to change. In thinking about KPIs, we do not need too many, nor trying to please \neverybody all of the time, still less companies\u2019 choice of KPIs being dictated by the public policy \nagenda.  In his view, KPIs should help the understanding of what is material to the business.  \n \nThe other top-line PWC findings were that of all companies in the FTSE350: \n\u2022 \u201c75% clearly disclose their principal risks and uncertainties \n\u2022 35% support their strategic statements with targets \u2013 qualitative or quantitative \n\u2022 41% provide information on the trends and factors likely to impact on their market place.\u201d  \n(p.4) \n \nThese high rates of apparent compliance are flattered, as Montagnon implied, by the use of financial \nKPIs already largely available from the accounts and analysts.  Black Sun (p.5) says \u201cmany \ncompanies are still struggling to provide meaningful non-financial metrics.\u201d  Perhaps the most \nremarkable aspect of the evaluation of narratives is how little attention is given to marketing (the \nsourcing and harvesting of cash flow) and\/or brand equity (the marketing asset which, for most \n \n8 Business Review: has it made a difference?

PWC (p.17) say \u201cA more in-depth analysis shows that the \npriorities and KPIs that have been aligned are primarily financial. What signal does this send to the \noutside world if resources such as people, customers, suppliers and brands are identified as key \nwithout supporting them with appropriate KPIs?\u201d  In their research, KPIs for brands do not register \nat all.  Reflecting these attitudes, Black Sun also paid no attention to marketing or branding. \n \nAn analysis of the KPIs used in the FTSE100 company annual reports, underlines this point.11  \nTable 2 shows how the 303 KPIs used in the narrative reports (3.3 per company) divided by type of \nmetric \n \nTable 2: KPIs reported by FTSE100 companies \n \n Percent \nFinancial 55.4 \nEmployee 18.5 \nEnvironment 15.8 \nTrading market  6.9 \nCommunity 2 \nOther 1.3 \n   Source: Black Sun, email 12th November 2007 \n  \nThe 21 (trading) market, or marketing, metrics reported are shown by Table 3. \n \nTable 3: Market KPIs reported by FTSE100 companies \n # mentions \nCustomer satisfaction 12 \nMarket share 3 \nBrand growth 2 \nCustomer churn 2 \nBrand perception  1 \nCustomer service 1 \nTotal 21 \n \n \nReaders of narrative reports need to see how KPIs change from year to year.  PWC is gentle again \n(p.17): \u201cCompanies\u2019 strategies evolve over time, so it should come as no surprise that only half of \nthe KPIs disclosed were consistent year-on-year. In itself this should not be an issue. The \nopportunity remains, however, for companies to disclose and explain more clearly the changes that \nhave been made.\u201d \n \nThe Worshipful Company of Marketors sponsored research by two London Business School \nstudents, Gonzalo Barreto and Antonio Risso, to refine the scoring system for narrative reporting \n(Figure 1) and apply it to the FTSE50 company annual reports.12   \n                                                 \n11 The analysis by Black Sun was of the 90 companies with year ends between December 2006 and July \n2007 and excluded non-standard KPIs, i.e. ones applying to that particular sector only.  \n12  \u201cTowards an Objective Scoring System to Rank the Corporate Narrative Sections of Annual Reports\u201d  \nLondon Business School, Second Year Project, MBA 2007 \n  9\n \nAstraZeneca scored most highly in terms of best narrative reporting practice with Cadbury and \nVodafone ranked 2nd and 3rd respectively.  Their scores were close with a mean 73%, i.e. they were \n73% of the ideal best practice according to the ASB Reporting Standard. At the other end, \nSainsbury, Imperial Tobacco, SAB Miller and Tesco, with a mean 40%, showed significant scope \nfor improvement.  The overall mean score was just under 60%. \n \nThe next section considers a practical approach for improving this performance without damaging \ncompetitiveness.  \n \nCan two negatives make a positive? \n \nBrand equity is becoming a widely used term, including in the ASB Reporting Standard, although it \nis not always fully understood.  It is an intangible asset created by good marketing and, other things \nequal, later becomes tangible in the shape of net cash flow.  In other words, a primary role of \nmarketing in the short-term is to create demand which pays back in the longer term.  Accordingly, if \nwe could reliably measure brand equity, we would have objective predictions of future cash flow. \n \nBest practice is therefore to identify those past measures of brand equity that have predicted cash \nflows today.  We cannot be sure history will repeat itself but at least this analysis provides some \nindication of the metrics, or KPIs, that the board needs to track, and also report to shareholders.  \nThus the board can provide forward-looking information in the shape of current market research \nand internal data.  Both sides should be satisfied: those demanding forward-looking information and \nthose reluctant to provide speculation about the future or confidential plans. \n \nBoards can and should be judged by the extent they have built these intangible assets, storehouses \nof future profit, alongside their short-term financial performance.  As Table 3 shows, in practice \nonly a tiny minority make any effort to report on their trading market metrics or brand equity and \nyet this is where the cash comes from.   \n \nOne popular measure of brand equity, although it did not show up on Table 3, is its value.  The \nmain methodology for brand valuation, or estimating customer equity as it is sometimes called, is to \npredict future cash flows and convert them to net present value.  The problems with that \nmethodology for reporting purposes are that future cash flows cannot be known with any certainty \nand present values depend on extrinsic factors such as future rates of interest.  Furthermore future \ncash flows cannot be distinguished between those due to past and future marketing activities.  A \ncompany is entitled to take credit for the former but not the latter. \n \nThe long-running debate about whether brand values should appear on balance sheets is sterile, \nhowever, for a different reason.  A company is entitled to report and track brand values in the \nnarrative parts of their annual reports and some do so.  If the value of their brand is both a metric \nused by the Board to monitor the business and useful information for shareholders, then reporting it \nis good practice.  Providing the information to shareholders matters but whether it appears in the \nnarrative or formal accounts is relatively immaterial. Thus it is unnecessary to include brand \nvaluations in the balance sheet whatever the accounting rules may be. \n \nThe purpose of marketing is to create the demand that the company can profitably meet.  In other \nwords, it is the creation and harvesting of cash flow.  Marketing and corporate performance are \nmuch the same: ultimate success for both is measured by long-term cash flow.  As noted above, the \n  10\nproblem is that we are never at \u201cultimate\u201d: in practice performance can only be measured by cash \nflow to date plus current indicators of future cash flow.  We can measure the past and the present \nbut not the future.  Thus, as discussed above, current indicators of future profits are also measures \nof brand equity. \n \nShareholders do not want forecasts based on guesswork; they want forward-looking information \nbased on evidence and experience.  Brand equity metrics should be gathered professionally, i.e. they \nshould be present day, factual evidence.  The choice of measures should be based, in part at least, \non their ability to predict subsequent profits and cash flow. \n \nAs discussed above, narrative reporting is rapidly converging on the ASB Reporting Standard \nexcept in two main areas: forward-looking information and non-financial KPIs, notably those that \nmarketers would see as brand equity.  Some other areas are also weak but these two are crucial for \ndetermining the company\u2019s future prospects.  We can make those two negatives into a positive by \nfocusing on brand equity metrics.  Providing the evidence that the Board itself uses for future \nexpectations meets the key guiding principle of the Reporting Standard:  \u201cseeing the business \nthrough the eyes of the directors\u201d.  Then observers have the evidence they need to do their own \nprojections. \n \nAt the same time it does not undermine competitiveness nor require the directors to indulge in \nspeculative forecasts.    \n  \n \nConclusions \n \nNarrative reporting in public company accounts has been developing fast in response to \nestablishment pressures such as the new ASB Reporting Standard and Companies Act 2006, and \nalso the growing recognition that greater transparency has benefits for the companies themselves, \nnotably for performance measurement and management, risk management, internal communication \nand coordination and investor relations.  It makes good sense that more shares will be traded and at \nhigher prices if the company is well marketed to the City, and that in turn requires better \ncommunications and transparency. \n \nReporting on these developments varies from the self-congratulatory to the cynical but there is no \ndoubt that company practice has changed from poor to average.  The marks in one research project \nreported ranged from 40% to 73% with a mean for the FTSE50 of 60%.  The scale was complete \nnon-compliance (0%) to ideal compliance with the ASB Reporting Standard.  Encouraging but \nroom for improvement.  \n \nWithin this pattern of increasing convergence with the ASB guidelines, which are largely advisory, \nlie a number of weaknesses.  The two with which this paper has been most concerned are the lack of \nprovision of forward-looking information and non-financial KPIs, notably measures of brand \nequity.  These are the two big negatives. \n \nThere are good reasons for the former.  Even with the new safe harbour provisions, it is unrealistic \nto expect directors to provide either their forward business plans in meaningful detail or forecasts \nwhich must be riddled with uncertainties. And if the information is merely boilerplate, i.e. not \nmeaningful, there is little point in providing it. \n \n  11\nOn the other hand, marketing KPIs, i.e. brand equity metrics, are largely known to competitors, and \nare factual indicators professionally and independently gathered.  A dashboard of such measures is \nwhat any Board should use to drive the business.  What directors see and use is, where \ncompetitively reasonable, what they should include in their narrative reports.  And by so doing, they \nwill turn the two current negatives into a future positive. \n \nSimilar developments are likely elsewhere.  The idea that the annual report should show the \nbusiness through the eyes of the directors came from Canada.  Whilst the new requirements, such as \nthe US 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act, may be initially seen as burdensome, some companies are \nincreasingly recognising the benefits of greater transparency in their narrative reporting.  \n"}
