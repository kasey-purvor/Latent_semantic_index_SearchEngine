The initiative was explicitly designated \nas a national pilot project with the key goal of \nraising levels of attainment in the pilot schools in \nliteracy and mathematics, which are the central \ncurriculum focus of the UK Government-funded \nPrimary National Strategy (i.e. strategy for raising \nstandards in primary or elementary schools across \nEngland). Some aspects of the project have been \npublished elsewhere, such as the initial literature \nscoping to identify likely issues with the evaluation \nABstrACt\nThe UK Government\u2019s Primary National Strategy undertook a pilot programme \u201cEmbedding ICT in \nthe Literacy and Numeracy Strategies\u201d where interactive whiteboards were installed in the classrooms \nof teachers of 9-11 year old students in more than 80 schools in six regions of England. Research to \nevaluate this project collected multiple sources of data, including students\u2019 attainment, structured lesson \nobservations and the perceptions of teachers and students. Results suggest that the use of the interactive \nwhiteboards did lead to significant changes in teachers\u2019 practices in the use of technology and in aspects \nof classroom interaction, and that the perceptions of those involved were overwhelmingly positive, but \nthat the impact in terms of students\u2019 attainment on national tests was very small and short-lived. This \nraises questions about the integration of new technologies into classroom teaching and how such tech-\nnologies might improve teaching and learning.\nDOI: 10.4018\/978-1-61520-715-2.ch006\n87\nThe Impact of Interactive Whiteboards\n(Smith, Higgins, Wall & Miller, 2005), changes \nin patterns of interaction identified through \nsystematic observation over the course of the \nresearch (Smith, Hardman & Higgins, 2006), two \nanalyses of students\u2019 perceptions using different \nmethodologies (Hall & Higgins, 2005; Wall, \nHiggins & Smith 2005), an analysis by gender \nof the impact on classroom interaction (Smith, \nHiggins & Hardman 2007) and a discussion of the \nlimitations of analysis of question types without \ninvestigating the subsequent discourse moves \n(Smith & Higgins, 2006). This chapter therefore \naims to synthesize key aspects of the findings in \nrelation to the overall objectives of the research \nin terms of its national policy objectives and to \nidentify key issues for wider research into the use of \ninteractive whiteboards in education. The process \nof the research also raises wider questions about \nthe way that educational research is valued and \nused at policy level in the UK and more general \nchallenges in evaluating the impact of technolo-\ngies on education.\nBACKGrOUND\nThe UK has invested heavily in promoting the \nuse of educational technologies in primary or \nelementary schools. Initiatives such as training \nfor teachers in the use of information and com-\nmunications technology in the late 1990s aimed \nto offer a course of training to all serving school \nteachers in the UK at a cost of about $800 million. \nAdditionally investment in hardware, software \nand networking (such as the development of a \n\u201cNational Grid for Learning\u201d) have similarly seen \nconsiderable sums (over $3 billion up to 2008).\nAt the policy level, the introduction of interac-\ntive whiteboards was seen as a way to integrate \ntechnology into teaching in primary or elementary \nschools and at the same time support the devel-\nopment of \u201cwhole class interactive teaching\u201d \n(Reynolds & Muijs, 1999) in order to improve \nstandards of attainment. Other goals were infor-\nmally identified, such as greater engagement of \nboys in lessons to address their perceived under-\nachievement. These aims were discussed with the \nfunders of the research and this helped to shape \nthe development of the research methodology.\nThe implementation of training and the support \nfor the teachers involved was also studied as part \nof the research. A model was developed in the \nproject where one full-time specialist teacher sup-\nported groups of about 20 teachers in each region. \nTraining materials were developed centrally, then \nrevised as they were used locally. A temporary \nwebsite was created to exchange ideas and teaching \nresources (used mainly by the specialist teachers, \nbut also by a number of classroom teachers in the \nproject). In addition, most regions established \nsupport groups which met more informally on a \nregular basis. The approach to supporting teachers \nin using the technology effectively was a key part \nof the pilot programme.\nreseArCh ApprOACh\nThe research team adopted a pragmatic approach \nto the evaluation of this major national initiative \nworking within the limitations imposed by the \nsponsors and the funding available. The main \ndriver of the research was to evaluate the impact \nof the initiative on national test results with an \nimplicit rationalist paradigm (Young, 1999) but \ninfluenced by post-positivist approaches such as \nscientific realism (Pawson & Tilley, 1997) and \nresponsive evaluation (Stake, 2004). Working \nwith the sponsors of the pilot project, the team \nplanned a multi-method approach to the evaluation \nusing complementary qualitative and quantitative \nmethods. The model of impact the research team \nused involved short-term indicators (participants\u2019 \nperceptions and changes in patterns of classroom \ninteraction) as well as outcomes (students\u2019 atti-\ntudes and attainment). A review of the available \nevidence at the outset of the project indicated that \nthe perceptions of those involved in the introduc-\n88\nThe Impact of Interactive Whiteboards\ntion of such technologies is generally positive, \nbut that information about the impact in terms of \nchanges of patterns of classroom interaction or \nmeasures of attainment were scarce (Smith et al., \n2005). This remains the trend in research in this \narea (Higgins, Beauchamp & Miller, 2007).\nThe research approach was influenced by this \nexisting evidence about the use of interactive \nwhiteboards in education. The team attempted \nto design the research to address some of these \nshortcomings similar to the approach advocated \nby Blatchford (2005) in terms of the balance of \nevidence types. The evaluation also took into \naccount aspects of the process of the initiative \n(such as technical and logistical issues) which \nwere fed back to the sponsors and participants \nas the research developed. The main focus of \nthis chapter, however, is the perceptions of the \nteachers and students involved of the impact of the \ntechnology, the actual changes found in classroom \ninteraction through systematic observation and \nthen the analysis of attainment data for literacy \nand mathematics, first after one, and then after \ntwo years of use.\nThe research team therefore used a multi-\nmethod approach to the evaluation of the impact \nof the technology on teaching and learning. \nQuantitative data was collected about aspects of \nclassroom discourse and interaction and about \nstudents\u2019 attainment using national test data. In \naddition the perceptions of teachers, students and \nothers involved in the initiative were included as \nan important aspect of the project methodology \n(van den Berg & Ros, 1999). In the sections which \nfollow, summaries are presented of some of the \ndata published elsewhere (Hall & Higgins, 2005; \nHiggins et al., 2005; Smith et al., 2005; Smith \net al., 2006; Smith & Higgins, 2006; Wall et al., \n2005) to provide a background for the discussion \nof issues concerning the synthesis of evidence \nin relation to the impact on students\u2019 attainment \nwhich has not been previously integrated into the \noverall analysis.\nDaily Use of interactive whiteboards \nfor Literacy and Mathematics\nDescriptive data about the day-to-day use of \nthe whiteboards was collected for two six-week \nperiods one year apart using online diary forms. \nThe weekly records contain data for about 100 \nteachers\u2019 self-reported use of the interactive white-\nboards (about half of the participating teachers) \nrepresenting about 8,800 lessons in literacy and \nmathematics. These teachers were volunteers \nand this may therefore over-estimate the actual \nusage (assuming the volunteers were more willing \nparticipants in completing the online forms and in \nparticipating in the project overall). The records \nindicate that the teachers reported using their \ninteractive whiteboards in just over two thirds of \ntheir lessons (66%) in the first year of the project \nand nearly three-quarters of their lessons (74%) \none year later. Interactive whiteboards were used \nslightly (and significantly) more often during \nmathematics lessons compared with literacy in \nthe first year of the project. This had evened out \na year later (with a 6.3% increase in reported use \nin mathematics and a 9.7% increase in literacy), \nresulting in no significant difference in reported \nuse by subject after two years. This suggests that \neither the teachers were initially more confident \nto use the IWBs for mathematics teaching or that \nthere were more activities or software available \nin this area of the curriculum at the start of the \nproject.\nConsistent patterns of use were reported over \nthe course of the week, with a steady decline in \nreported use from Monday to Thursday (from \nabout 80% of lessons at the beginning of the \nweek to about 73% of lessons on a Thursday) and \nsignificantly fewer teachers reporting using IWBs \non Fridays (about 67% of lessons).\nUse increased in all parts of lessons (whole \nclass introduction, group and plenary phases) and \npatterns of software use indicated that teachers \nwere involved in developing or adapting resources \nmore in the second year of the research, suggest-\n89\nThe Impact of Interactive Whiteboards\ning greater levels of confidence and skill in using \nthe technology (for further details see Higgins \net al., 2005). These data indicate that the pilot \nproject was successful in developing use of the \ntechnology to a point where it was being used in \nnearly three-quarters of lessons of the teachers \nwho completed the weekly records.\nChanges in patterns of \nClassroom interaction\nStructured observations of classroom interaction \nwere undertaken in early 2003 and again a year \nlater in early 2004. A total of 184 lessons of a \nrandom sample of 30 teachers were observed; the \nresearch focused on differences between lessons \nwhere teachers taught literacy and mathematics \nwith and without an interactive whiteboard and \non any changes in patterns of interaction a year \nlater. This enabled us to investigate potential dif-\nferences in classroom interaction between those \nteachers when using whiteboards and when they \nwere not. Our sample size was also large enough \nto compare literacy and mathematics lessons and \nto examine any interaction effect between lessons \nwith and without an interactive whiteboard and \nsubject area (literacy or mathematics). The struc-\ntured observation system was developed from that \nof Mroz, Smith and Hardman (2000) and Smith, \nHardman, Mroz and Wall (2004), based on earlier \nclassroom observational research (Croll, 1986; \nFlanders, 1963; Galton, Hargreaves, Comber, \nWall & Pell, 1999; Good & Brophy, 1991). Full \ndetails of the findings from this aspect of the \nresearch are published elsewhere in terms of \ngeneral patterns of interaction (Smith et al., 2006) \nas well as an analysis in terms of gender (Smith \net al., 2007), and a summary of these findings is \npresented below.\nOverall the interactions in lessons were fairly \ntypical of the kinds of patterns in primary schools \nidentified in this earlier research. For example, the \nmost frequent discourse moves were explaining \nby the teacher (135 \u2018moves\u2019 per hour, each lasting \non average 12 seconds and accounting for 28% \nof lesson time), closed questions by the teacher \n(62 per hour, each lasting on average only 3.5 \nseconds), evaluation by the teacher (62 per hour, \non average 4.7 seconds long and accounting for \n7.5% of lesson time), and direction (51 per hour, \nlasting 8.1 seconds on average and comprising \n9.4% of lesson time). A typical pupil answer lasted \nfor 4.4 seconds and such answers accounted for \nabout 17% of the duration of a lesson overall.\nThe use of interactive whiteboards did seem \nto make a difference to aspects of classroom \ninteraction. Some of these were relatively short-\nlived, others appeared over time as the use of the \ntechnology became embedded. From both years of \nobservations, there were fewer pauses and uptake \nquestions in interactive whiteboard lessons; but \nan embedding effect was observed in the second \nyear of the project whereby there were also more \nopen questions, repeat questions, probes, longer \nanswers from students, and general talk in these \nlessons. There was almost twice the amount of \nevaluative responses from teachers in interactive \nwhiteboard lessons. Teachers using interactive \nwhiteboards after a year of use tended to focus \ntheir uptake or follow-up questions on the whole \nclass rather than on an individual student.\nThere was a faster pace in the interactive \nwhiteboard lessons (as measured by total num-\nber of discourse moves) in 2004 compared with \nthe non-whiteboard lessons in 2003. Nearly 100 \nmore discourse moves were found per lesson \n(such as explanations, questions, evaluations and \nanswers). However, answers from students were \nalso longer in whiteboard lessons compared to \nnon-whiteboard lessons. The initial decrease in \nthe amount of explanation by the teacher was \nshort-lived (it increased again in 2004).\nThere were a number of statistically significant \ndifferences between mathematics and literacy \nlessons. For example, closed questions made up \n9.5% of an average mathematics lesson but only \n3.4% of a literacy lesson. Open questions consti-\ntuted 3.1% of a literacy lesson but only 0.9% of a \n90\nThe Impact of Interactive Whiteboards\nmathematics lesson. Presenting from pupils and \nuptake questions by the teacher both had larger \npercentage contributions in literacy lessons; and \nteacher direction (such as giving instructions) had a \nlarger percentage contribution in mathematics les-\nsons. These differences were consistent, however, \nbetween whiteboard and non-whiteboard lessons \nsuggesting a strong subject pedagogy with clear \npatterns of interaction associated with the different \nlessons in literacy and in mathematics.\nIn the first set of observations, interactive \nwhiteboard lessons contained about five minutes \nmore whole class teaching and five minutes less \ngroup work than lessons without an interactive \nwhiteboard. This difference was found in both \nliteracy and mathematics. After a year the amount \nof group work had decreased further (this time a \ndifference of nearly seven and a half minutes). \nThis difference was found in the classes of 9-10 \nyear olds (Year 5) and of 10-11 year olds (Year \n6) classes.\nThe patterns of interaction in lessons by boys \nand girls remained consistent across both interac-\ntive whiteboard lessons and lessons where such \ntechnology was not used. There was no difference \nin who initiated or who received questions and \nanswers between interactive whiteboard and non-\ninteractive whiteboard lessons. Although there \nare clear differences in patterns of interaction and \nresponse between boys and girls (Smith et al., \n2007), particularly in terms of the greater amount \nof attention boys receive, the introduction of the \ninteractive whiteboard did not make a significant \ndifference to these patterns.\nInterpretation of these findings is challenging. \nSome of the changes suggest an increase in the \nkinds of interaction associated with more effective \nteaching (e.g. Muijs & Reynolds, 2001; Nystrand \n& Gamoran, 1991), although the relationship \nbetween observed teacher and learner behaviors \nand teaching effectiveness is an elusive one (Rex, \nSteadman & Graciano, 2006). In particular the \nincrease in open questions, length of answers and \nuse of \u201cprobes\u201d or follow-up questions indicate \na more interactive style of classroom discourse \n(Galton et al., 1999). Others may or may not be \nso beneficial. Pace of lessons is an example of \nthis (Muijs & Reynolds, 2001, p. 9) as pace of \ninteraction must be balanced with students\u2019 level \nof understanding. Inspection reports in the UK \noften comment favorably on one of the benefits \nof information and communications technology \nas enabling a faster pace of lessons (e.g. Ofsted, \n2005, p. 16). The research reported here confirms \nthat the use of interactive whiteboard technology \nis indeed associated with faster pace (at least in \nterms of the number of interactions in lessons). \nHowever, overall it is difficult to determine from \nthe observational evidence alone whether the \nintroduction of IWBs had a positive impact on \ninteraction in these classes.\nteachers\u2019 perceptions\nStructured interviews were undertaken with a \nrandom sample of 68 teachers to determine their \nperceptions of the impact of the technology on \ntheir teaching and their views of the training and \nsupport they had received. Checks were made to \nensure that the sample was broadly representative \nof the group of teachers as a whole (Higgins et \nal., 2005). These interviews were conducted by \ntelephone and covered areas such as teaching \nand ICT experience, training and more detailed \nexploration of their use of the technology and \ntheir perceptions of its impact.\nOverall, the teachers interviewed were ex-\ntremely positive about the impact of interactive \nwhiteboards on their teaching. They were also \npositive about the training and support that they had \nreceived as part of the pilot project with the major-\nity of teachers reporting that using the interactive \nwhiteboard had improved their confidence. All of \nthem felt that the interactive whiteboard helped \nthem to achieve their teaching aims and cited a \nnumber of factors such as the wealth of resources \navailable, the stimulating nature of the presentation \nand the flexibility that the technology offers. The \n91\nThe Impact of Interactive Whiteboards\noverwhelming majority (99%) believed that using \nthe interactive whiteboard in lessons improved \nstudents\u2019 motivation to learn. Eighty-five percent \nthought that interactive whiteboards would lead \nto improvements in student attainment, though \nsome felt that this would be dependent on how \nthe interactive whiteboard was used and that such \nimpact might not be evident immediately.\nIn terms of patterns of working, the teachers \nwere asked how the interactive whiteboard had \naffected their teaching and just over 70% reported \nthat they were doing more teaching of the whole \nclass together (as opposed to setting group or \nindividual work) and a greater majority (81%) \nthought that their workload had increased since \nthe introduction of the interactive whiteboard, \none of the few negative comments in relation to \nthe new technology, though about one third of \nthese believed (or hoped) that the increase would \nbe only temporary in nature as they developed, \nstored and shared their digital resources.\nFifty-six percent of respondents said they had \nnot noticed any differences between boys and girls \nin relation to interactive whiteboard use while \n44% said they had noticed differences, usually \ncommenting on a positive impact on boys such \nas that they were more motivated and interested \nor more focused and involved.\nOverall the responses were overwhelmingly \npositive about the introduction of this technol-\nogy in the classroom, with by far the majority of \nteachers commenting that they believed that the \ninteractive whiteboards helped them to achieve \ntheir teaching aims and to improve students\u2019 \nmotivation.\nstudent\u2019s views\nTwelve sets of student interviews were conducted \nbetween March and April 2004 with groups of \nstudents who had been in classes where interac-\ntive whiteboards had been used for two years. The \nschools were chosen at random, but each school \nselected the group to be interviewed. In total, 72 \nstudents were involved in the group interviews. \nThe interviews were taped and transcribed, then \nanalyzed for the responses to each of the questions \nas well as for any further themes which emerged \n(Hall & Higgins, 2005).\nThe students were very positive about the use \nof interactive whiteboards, they particularly liked \nthe multimedia potential of the technology and \nbelieved that they learned better when an inter-\nactive whiteboard was used in the classroom. In \nparticular, most of the student groups interviewed \nbelieved that the interactive whiteboard helped \nthem to pay better attention during lessons. Their \nreasons for this appear to revolve around the \nopportunities for a wider range of resources and \nmulti-media being used, though they generally also \nliked having their work shown on the interactive \nwhiteboard. It was widely seen as an opportunity \nto learn and to improve their work. Students also \nsaid that they would like to use the interactive \nwhiteboard themselves more than they currently \nhad opportunities to and that they would like it \nif their teachers used the interactive whiteboard \nmore in lessons. The consensus seemed to be that \nmathematics was the most popular lesson among \nthose students interviewed although students also \nreadily identified other lessons that they enjoyed \nwhen an interactive whiteboard was used.\nStudents identified a number of common prob-\nlems which were encountered by their teachers. \nApart from the interactive whiteboard breaking \ndown entirely or having to be recalibrated (which \nthey universally found frustrating), students men-\ntioned difficulties seeing the interactive white-\nboard when sunlight shone through the windows. \nThey also noted that sometimes moving objects \non the board could be difficult to manipulate or \nto see clearly and that some colors of text were \nhard to read.\nAsking pupils whether there were any dif-\nferences between boys and girls in connection \nwith interactive whiteboards sparked off a level \nof rivalry between them (all of the groups were \nmixed), which made it difficult to tease out whether \n92\nThe Impact of Interactive Whiteboards\nthere are any real differences in their perceptions. \nStudent responses fell into four distinct themes: \nspecific pupils are chosen more than other pupils \nto answer questions; boys use the interactive \nwhiteboard more than girls; girls use the interac-\ntive whiteboard more than boys; everyone gets an \nequal chance to use the interactive whiteboard. \nThere was no clear consensus over this theme.\nAn innovative methodology was also used to \nrecord pupils\u2019 views using templates of a classroom \nscene with an IWB and showing children with \nspeech and thought bubbles (see Figure 1) to try \nto elicit their thoughts about learning with IWBs \n(Wall et al., 2005; Wall et al., 2007) as opposed to \nsimply what they thought of them. Eighty pupils \n(46 boys and 34 girls) in three LEAs completed \nthe pupil views templates.\nThe responses were broken down into 1,568 \nindividual statements for analysis, ranging from \nsingle words to whole sentences. The split between \nresponses in the thought and speech bubbles was \napproximately equal (51% and 49% respectively). \nThe statements were then categorized accord-\ning to whether they were positive, negative, or \nneutral, with the majority positive (56%) and \nneutral (32%).\nThe use of the cartoon structure seemed to \nfacilitate discussion and recording of thinking \nprocesses such as remembering, understanding and \nconcentrating in relation to the use of the IWB. \nOther areas recorded corresponded more closely \nto the findings from the focus group discussions \nsuch as enjoying the variety and the multimedia \nfeatures of the boards as well as some of the \nchallenges and difficulties in their use (such as \ntechnical difficulties, frequent recalibration, vis-\nibility of text and the like).\nThe overall impression from both sets of in-\nterviews was of a positive reaction to the technol-\nogy, particularly in terms of their motivation and \nlearning, but of informed and critical comments \nabout the use of the technology more generally. \nThese findings are broadly consistent with the \nwider research on students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 percep-\ntions of interactive whiteboard use in education \n(Higgins et al., 2007).\nFigure 1. The IWB pupil views template\n93\nThe Impact of Interactive Whiteboards\nimpact on student Attainment\nData at student level from the national tests in \nEnglish, mathematics and science for 11 year \nolds were provided by the UK\u2019s Department for \nEducation and Skills (DfES) for 2003 and for 2004. \nData were provided for both the project schools \nand a further matched control group of schools \nin the same Local Education Authority (LEA) \nas a comparison. These data were then analyzed \nto identify any impact of the use of interactive \nwhiteboards in the project schools and to see if \nthere was any difference in impact according to \ngender or for high or low attaining students.\nThe group of the pilot project schools and \nmatched control group consisted of 67 of the \nschools in the six LEAs who participated in the \nproject, while the control group consisted of 55 \nschools from the same LEAs. As the use of inter-\nactive whiteboards started in most schools early \nin 2003, the schools were matched on the basis of \ntheir 2002 national test performance, using both \nmean points score and mean percentage of students \nachieving level 4 and above (this is the target level \nfor 11 year olds). As the interactive whiteboard \nschools had test scores about five points above the \nnational average, it was not possible to constitute \na control group of the same size as the interac-\ntive whiteboard group, nor to include all project \nschools in the experimental group. Schools were \nalso included only if test data were available for \nall three years from 2002-2004. The matching was \ncarried out so as to ensure similar proportions of \nschools in each of eight percentile bands and where \nthere were more potential control group schools \nthan required in a band, the selection was carried \nout using random numbers. Checks were made \nso that the two groups were well matched on the \nfollowing additional criteria: mean number of \nstudents on roll in 2002, mean proportion of stu-\ndents with Special Educational Needs, patterns of \nattendance in 2002 and national test performance \nin 2001. In all cases the two groups were seen to \nbe equivalent, with no differences approaching \nstatistical significance.\nThe 2003 national tests were taken in May, \nafter approximately five to seven months of use of \ninteractive whiteboards in the project schools. This \nis a relatively short time for any effect to become \napparent, but as shown in Table 1, the mean raw \ntest scores in the interactive whiteboard schools \nare slightly higher than in the control schools, with \nstatistically significant margins for mathematics \nand science. However, the effect size in each case \nis very small.\nA year later, in 2004, raw test scores were \nagain made available by the DfES and the overall \ncomparison of interactive whiteboard and control \nsamples is presented in Table 2. Here it can be \nseen that there are no significant differences \nbetween the two groups and the effect sizes are \nnegligible. The small benefit for the interactive \nwhiteboard schools seen in mathematics and \nscience test results in 2003 was not sustained. \nAnalysis of teacher assessments in 2004 yield a \nvery similar set of results, with non-significant \nbetween-group differences and very small effect \nsizes of 0.06 for English, 0.04 for mathematics \nand 0.01 for science.\nWhen the 2004 Reading and Writing test \ncomponents for English are compared separately, \nthe effect sizes for between-group differences are \n-0.01 for Reading and 0.05 for Writing.\nAlthough some of the initial differences were \nstatistically significant the extent of the difference \n(the effect size) was small. The early improvement \nseen after the first few months may have been a \nnovelty or Hawthorne effect of some kind (Gil-\nliespie, 1991). It did not lead to further improve-\nment in the following year, which might have \nbeen expected on the hypotheses that students \nwere taught more actively, and therefore perhaps \nmore effectively, in interactive whiteboard classes. \nThe initial small improvement in mathematics and \nscience did not seem to provide a platform for \ncontinued improvement for students the follow-\n94\nThe Impact of Interactive Whiteboards\ning year. It therefore appears that, after two years, \nthe impact of the use of interactive whiteboards \nis not identifiable in the levels of attainment of \nstudents, at least as measured in national tests. \nWhile the nature of the evaluation design (with-\nout random allocation) means it would not have \nbeen possible to claim a clear causal inference \nhad a significant and substantial difference been \nfound (there may have been systematic bias in \nthe allocation of schools to the IWB intervention \nfor example), the absence of a clear difference is \nindicative (or at least strongly suggestive) of a \nlack of direct effect.\nissues and Challenges\nThe analysis indicates that it is important to \nconsider the multiple sources of data in evaluat-\ning the impact of the introduction of educational \ntechnology on this scale. The teachers involved \nall rated the introduction of the interactive white-\nboards, the training in its use and the support from \nthe specialist teachers very highly. There can be \nno doubt that the technology had a real impact \non the primary or elementary school classrooms \nwhere they were introduced. The response of the \nteachers and students involved in the project was \noverwhelmingly positive. Both of these groups \nreported that they were convinced that these \nchanges were improving the teaching and learning \nin lessons where they were used.\nThe observations confirmed that there were \nsignificant differences in patterns of classroom \ninteraction, both as the teachers learned to use the \ntechnology and a year later as the use of interac-\ntive whiteboards became more \u201cembedded\u201d in \nliteracy and mathematics lessons. Overall interac-\ntive whiteboards did seem to make a difference to \naspects of classroom interaction. Some of these \nwere relatively short-lived, others appeared over \ntime as the use of the technology became embed-\nded. For example, there were fewer pauses and \nuptake questions in lessons where an interactive \nwhiteboard was used and an embedding effect \nTable 1.

This suggests a \nstronger lesson \u201cflow\u201d (Jewitt, Moss & Cardini, \n2007; Kounin, 1970). There was almost twice the \namount of evaluative responses from teachers in \nwhiteboard lessons. The indications from these \nobservations also suggested that the changes in \nquestioning by the teachers and the responses \nfrom their students were consistent with the kinds \nof interaction associated with effective teaching \nand in particular teacher questioning (e.g. Muijs \n& Reynolds, 2001; Nystrand & Gamoran, 1991). \nThe enthusiasm of the teachers and the early data \nfrom the evaluation convinced policy-makers that \nthe approach was successful and plans to widen \nthe pilot began before the final analysis of national \ntest data were available.\nThis analysis of students\u2019 performance in \nliteracy, mathematics and science tests at first \nsuggested that the impact of the introduction of \ninteractive whiteboards was associated with some \nsmall improvements in children\u2019s learning. The \naggregated national test results show that after \none year the pilot project schools made slightly \nmore progress overall than a matched group of \nschools not involved in the project, with a rather \nsmall effect size of 0.09. However, these differ-\nences were not found after the second year of the \nproject, suggesting that the early improvement \nwas due to the initial intervention or that sustained \nimprovement is harder to achieve, especially in \nrelatively high performing schools and as mea-\nsured by national tests.\nimplications and issues \nfor future research\nThis chapter has presented findings from a major \nnational policy initiative in the UK where edu-\ncational technology was introduced to improve \nstandards of attainment. The research findings \nindicate that caution is needed in introducing \nsuch new technologies, if the aim is to improve \nstudent\u2019s levels of tested attainment. Initial indi-\ncators from the innovation were positive, yet the \nfinal outcomes of the research suggest that the \noverall impact on standards was negligible. The \ntechnological validity (Strassmann, 1974) of the \nstudy is demonstrated through similar findings \nbeing repeated both in other similar evaluations \nof IWB technology and in more general imple-\nmentation studies of educational technology more \nbroadly.\nAs in the US, current political pressures on \nthe educational research community are such that \nresearch should meet the demands of evidence-\nbased and scientifically-based inquiry, however \nthe policy drive by the Primary National Strategy \nin England has been to continue to promote the \n\u2018embedding\u2019 of such technologies in schools, \ndespite the lack of convincing evidence of impact \non student attainment or more developmental re-\nsearch into how teachers\u2019 can best be supported in \ngetting the best from the technology. This raises \nquestions about how educational research is valued \nand used at policy level and more broadly about \neducational research and its utility.\nthe fUtUre Of iwB reseArCh\nOne direction for further research is in the nature \nof the technology itself. Interactive (single-touch) \nsurfaces to control a computer and to display in-\nformation are clearly welcomed by both teachers \nand students. Multitouch interfaces are the focus \nof much current development (such as Microsoft\u2019s \nSurfaceTM or even Apple\u2019s iPhone). The devel-\nopment of multi-touch interfaces for computer \ndisplays for use by both teachers and learners is \nlikely therefore to be motivating and productive. \nIf the lessons from the introduction of IWBs are \nlearned, then educational impact will be achieved \nby identifying a match between the affordances of \nthe technology with the pedagogical affordances \nof its introduction into educational settings. The \n96\nThe Impact of Interactive Whiteboards\nstage after this is perhaps the development of \nmulti-user, multi-touch environments, such as the \nprototype SynergyNET environment (see http:\/\/\ntel.dur.ac.uk\/) where networked multi-touch tables \nare the basis of a classroom environment supported \nwith interactive technologies. Here again the em-\nphasis must be on the pedagogical possibilities, \nrather than the technological capabilities.\nA clear indication from the findings from \nthis project is that research in embedding new \nor developing technologies in education needs a \npedagogical design phase as well as a technological \none. The levels of enthusiasm for the technology \nsuggest that this could have been achieved with \nthe support of the teachers (and students) involved. \nThe pedagogical intervention in this project could \nbe described as negligible in that the technol-\nogy was used to support existing approaches to \nteaching literacy and mathematics. There was no \nexploration or evaluation of how the technology \nmight have supported changes or improvement to \nteaching and learning approaches, such as through \nimproved modeling or the use of dynamic images \nfor example. This is an area which still needs \nfurther research (Higgins et al., 2007).\nIt may be, of course, that the introduction of \nthe technology was beneficial for learning, but \nthat the indicators used to assess outcomes did \nnot capture the changes that resulted. Certainly \nnational test performance represents only a limited \nassessment of learning in mathematics or literacy \n(see, for example, James & Brown, 2005). It fo-\ncuses impact narrowly on a range of quantifiable \noutcomes, usually with a particular curriculum \ncontent focus (often heavily weighted towards the \nknowledge domain). The use of digital technolo-\ngies may be beneficial because it develops deeper \nknowledge, more positive attitudes or learning \ndispositions, more creative and flexible learners, \nor better social learning situations; indeed there \nis evidence that such approaches are associated \nwith higher attainment in specific subjects of the \ncurriculum (Voogt & Knezek, 2008).\nThere is a general assumption that new tech-\nnologies can (or even will) improve learning; \nhowever on occasion the different enthusiasts seem \nto talk over each other without exploring how their \ndifferent conceptions of learning are affecting their \ninterpretation of the existing evidence and current \nuse of technology in schools. From the learner\u2019s \npoint of view, there are those who see the avail-\nability of technology as a means to altering the \ncurriculum and certainly the means of accessing \nthe curriculum (Loveless, DeVoogd & Bohlin, \n2001; Nachimias, Mioduser & Forkosh-Baruch, \n2008). This stance can perhaps be identified as \naligned with the \u201cpupil-empowerment\u2019 dimension \nand connected with primary or elementary school \nteachers\u2019 thinking about educational technology \nand learning (Higgins & Moseley, 2001). From this \nviewpoint ICT offers a way to enable children to \nlearn by giving them access to information (Law, \n2004), tools (Jonassen, 2000) or to take control of \naspects of their learning (Smeets & Mooij, 2001) \nin a way that is educationally more desirable. The \nintroduction of IWBs in the UK was clearly not \naimed at achieving this goal.\nAssessiNG the iMpACt Of \nteChNOLOGY Use ON LeArNiNG\nIt is therefore possible to conceptualize new ap-\nproaches in terms of their view of pedagogy (or \npedagogies) for educational technologies. Most \nadvocates of digital technologies see them as a \nway of altering aspects of teaching and learn-\ning, particularly in terms of empowering pupils \nthrough the use of technology as Scrimshaw\u2019s \n(2004) analysis identifies. This could perhaps be \ncharacterized broadly as having a view of a pro-\nspective pedagogy (Higgins & Moseley, 2001) in \nwhich technology is used to develop or re-shape \naspects of teaching and learning. This position is \nhard to counter as it takes the view that technology \ncan support the development of a more effective \n97\nThe Impact of Interactive Whiteboards\ncurriculum (e.g. Loveless et al., 2001). Since it \nimplicitly advocates changes in the curriculum \nor pedagogy, the use of outcome indicators from \nthe current position form only part of the case \n(or perhaps the \u201ccause\u201d more accurately): it may \nbe that the effectiveness of the introduction of \ntechnology, for example in developing more \nindependent learners, can only be judged after a \nlonger period of time. It is therefore possible to \ntake up a position that the use of technology in \nthis way cannot be effectively evaluated until its \nimpact upon the curriculum or upon the learners \nis complete. Others may see this as a dangerous \nposition (e.g. Cuban, 2001) as criteria to judge \nthe effectiveness of ICT are always in the future \nand the promise is always of \u201cjam tomorrow\u201d \n(Blamires, 2004).\nIt is therefore necessary for those of us who \nadvocate the use of technology in schools to be \nclear about what it might achieve and to identify \nsome indicators to assess its impact. These might \nbe characterized as follows:\n1.  The technology will help do what you \nhave to do now, but better (either more ef-\nficiently or more effectively). This could be \nevaluated by pupils\u2019 achieving either greater \nsuccess on conventional outcome measures \nor achieving equal success, but with less \nteaching, or with greater understanding, or \nwith more positive attitudes or dispositions \ntowards learning. This rationale should \nidentify the means by which the technology \nwill improve upon existing pedagogy, such \nas through more effective feedback as simply \nreplacing current practices with technology \nis unlikely to provide benefits.\n2.  The technology will help you achieve \nother things that you value educationally \nand be as effective or more effective on \nconventional measures; or, if less effec-\ntive on conventional outcomes, it should \nbe possible to justify why the benefits \noutweigh the disadvantages. This might \nbe through developing more effective pat-\nterns of talk or collaborative skills or better \nunderstanding.\n3.  Technology will help you develop the cur-\nriculum and its assessment to something \nthat you value more. The development of \nnew approaches such as digital portfolios for \nincremental or ipsative self-assessment by \nlearners may be considered to be of sufficient \nbenefit that the impact of their introduction \nis worth pursuing to achieve long-term aims \nof improving important aspects of teaching \nand learning. In this position it is incumbent \non the proponents of such a change to argue \nclearly what the likely impact is to be and to \nbe clear about the costs and benefits (human \nas well as financial) of such change at each \nstage of the process.\n4.  Technology will help you explore how \nteaching and learning may be changed. \nThe process of change offers the opportunity \nto explore how ICT can affect pedagogy \n(e.g. Loveless et al., 2001). The main is-\nsues here are moral ones about how those \ninvolved in such an exploration understand \nand have given consent to be involved. \nAgain the onus is on the advocates to be \nclear about their theoretical and practical \nrationale as to why such changes are likely \nto be beneficial (and then in what way they \nare actually beneficial) as well as what the \ndisadvantages might be.\nCONCLUsiON\nThe challenge of this evaluation of the introduction \nof interactive whiteboards into primary schools \nin the UK was in integrating the data and find-\nings from the various sources over the course \nof the evaluation. The short and medium term \nindicators were positive. Teachers\u2019 and learners\u2019 \nperceptions were overwhelmingly positive with \nvery few negative points raised in the interviews \n98\nThe Impact of Interactive Whiteboards\nand were supported with what appeared to be \npositive and quantifiable changes in patterns of \nclassroom interaction which might be associated \nwith more effective teaching. Use of the technol-\nogy increased, again suggesting a positive trend. \nThe initial impact on tested attainment was small, \nbut positive. However, there was no sustained \nimprovement in test scores once the technology \nwas embedded in the classrooms of the schools \nwhere it had been introduced.\nOf course the study also had significant limita-\ntions. There was no random assignment of schools \nor teachers to the intervention with interactive \nwhiteboards. The schools chosen were already \nabove the norm in terms of their test results. The \npedagogic model of use was determined by the \nPrimary National Strategy and involved direct \ntranslation of the existing approach to teaching \nadvocated by the former Literacy and Numeracy \nStrategies without interactive whiteboards and \nwithout any exploration of how learning interac-\ntions might be enhanced by the new technology \nsuch as by applying aspects of multimedia learning \ntheory (Mayer, 2001). Exploration of such varia-\ntion in use is essential to explore in any variation \nof impact of new technologies. We need to know \nnot just whether they are more effective (in some \nway) than what went before, but also the ways \nin which the range of ways they can be used is \nrelated to aspects of learning. The policy adop-\ntion of the technology and its subsequent uptake \nin the UK made it impossible in a relatively short \ntime to evaluate the contribution that interactive \nwhiteboards make to learning. There are now an \naverage of 18 interactive whiteboards in every \nprimary school in England, at least according to \nrecent figures (Smith, Rudd & Coghlan, 2008, \np. 19).\nTechnology on its own does not change peda-\ngogy. It is clear from the observations that the \ncharacteristic patterns of interaction in primary \nschool classrooms remain constant in whole class \nteaching with or without interactive whiteboard \ntechnology. These patterns of interaction are led \nby teachers with largely responsive behaviors by \nboth boys and girls (though with boys getting more \nof the teachers\u2019 attention). There are also charac-\nteristic patterns of interaction in mathematics and \nliteracy lessons (such as the pattern of open and \nclosed questions) which are also affected very little \nby interactive whiteboards. Both the classroom \nand subject pedagogies are more robust that the \nopportunities offered by technology. Though there \nwere some changes in teachers\u2019 practice in terms \nof the balance of lessons between whole class and \nindividual or group work and in an overall increase \nof \u2018pace\u2019 (the number and type of questions and \nresponses) these were not sufficient to bring \nabout identifiable changes in students\u2019 learning \nas measured by national standards.\nFuture studies of technology implementation \nneed to have a clear hypothesis about how tech-\nnology is likely to improve learning. This could \ninclude increased time spent on learning, or the \ndevelopment of better understanding through \nmore effective modeling. Moreover, it would \nrequire researchers to undertake a design which \ninvestigates this hypothesis within the evaluation \nor research, such as by investigating correlations \nbetween increased time spent learning with \ngreater knowledge acquisition or an association \nbetween the assessment of richer understanding \nwith increased use of modeling or visualization \nactivities. Evaluation of pedagogical change is at \nleast as important as evaluation of technological \nchange.\nrefereNCes\nBlamires, M. (2004). Virtual learning or real \nlearning?  In Hayes, D.
