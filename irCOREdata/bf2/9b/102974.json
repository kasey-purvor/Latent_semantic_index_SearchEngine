In DF, information coming from different sources is\nsimply combined regardless of their respective link qualities,\nand thus DF is not optimized for any propagation conditions. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel transmit cooperation scheme that\nexploits asymmetric link qualities by using layered higher order\nmodulation. A partial forwarding approach is followed by taking\nadvantage of the layered structure: one part of the information is\nforwarded by a relay for increasing the robustness of the direct\nlink and the rest of the information flows through the boosted\ndirect link. Moreover, our scheme is based on a distributed\nserially concatenated encoding structure that can accommodate\niterative decoding to further improve its performance. The\ncomplexity of our scheme is seemingly identical to DF scheme.\nPerformance evaluation shows that our scheme provides a better\nspectral efficiency in asymmetric propagation conditions than DF\nscheme for both non-iterative and iterative decoding.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nDecode-and-forward (DF) is a well-known and documented\ntechnique that has been first designed for simple cooperative\ncommunications [1]\u2013[3], and later it has been extended for\nmulti-input-multi-output architectures [4]. In a simple cooper-\nation scenario composed of a source (S) node, a destination\n(D) node, and a single relay (R) node, three node-to-node\nlinks are established, i.e., S-D, S-R, and R-D links. The\ncommon approach in DF over a cooperative relay channel\nis the full decoding of the source message followed by the\nforwarding of the whole message to the D node via the\nR node [5]. At the D node, the data which are received\ndirectly from the S node and indirectly through the R node\nare properly combined. However, this combining process is\nperformed without taking into account the respective quality\nof the different links. Recently, it has been shown in [6] and [7]\nthat additional knowledge as such can have a positive influence\non the performance and spectral efficiency of DF scheme.\nThe transmission rate and format employed at S and R\ntransmitters should be properly adjusted according to the\nexpected quality of the links. Due to the broadcast nature of\nthe S transmission targeted towards both the R and D nodes,\nthe settings of modulation and coding format for this node\nface a dilemma in asymmetric link conditions. If the R node\nis sufficiently close to the S node and the S-R link quality\nis high, then the R node can increase the communication\nreliability by helping the S node in its transmission process.\nThis form of operation is commonly known as transmit (Tx)\ncooperation, and it can be used for throughput enhancement\nwhen the D node lies in shaded area or is close to the cell-\nboundary, as advocated by the IEEE 802.16m task group\nin [8]. In a typical Tx cooperation the S-R link capacity\nis much larger than the direct S-D link capacity. In this\ncondition, an adjustment of the transmit format of S based\nsolely on the minimum capacity of the two links leave the\nhigh capacity link unexploited. Here, we consider a different\napproach to the common DF scheme and create a layered\ntransmission format in order to effectively and simultaneously\nexploit the different capacities of both S-D and S-R links,\nas we previously introduced in [7]. As a result, we propose\na novel Tx cooperation scheme using layered higher order\nmodulation (LHOM), refereed as DF-LHOM in the paper, that\nbenefits from asymmetric propagation conditions. The created\nlayered structure forms two parallel flows of information:\none directly routed and one forwarded through the relay. The\nforwarded flow is further exploited as auxiliary information to\ncreate an effective robust constellation over the direct link. The\nauxiliary forwarded information of the layered modulation is\nerror protected through an inner encoder that naturally drives\nus to adopt a serially concatenated encoding structure [9].\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. An overview\nof multi-layer modulation is given in Section II. In Section\nIII, the system model of our novel DF-LHOM scheme is\npresented, and a detailed diagram illustrating both the LHOM\nand distributed serially concatenated structures is provided\nfor each node. Simulation results of our novel DF-LHOM\nscheme for various LHOM constellations and iterative decoder\nsettings are provided in Section IV. These results, which\nare compared against those obtained for DF scheme with\niterative decoding (ID) or non-ID [5], show that our scheme\nperforms better than these schemes in asymmetric propagation\nconditions. Furthermore, our DF-LHOM scheme is evaluated\nfor various constellation labelings, and different puncturing\npatterns. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section V.\nII. MULTI-LAYER MODULATION\nIn digital communications, a finite quadrature amplitude\nmodulation (QAM) signal alphabet \u03c7 \u2282 C associated with a\none- to-one binary labeling map \u03bc :{0, 1}m \u0003\u2192 \u03c7, m=log2 |\u03c7|,\nforms a constellation.

A symbol error event may\nlead to different numbers of erroneous bits according to the\nlabeling \u03bc which is considered. Therefore, different types of\nlabeling provide different bit-error rate (BER) performances.\nAmong all the possible types, Gray and set partitioning (SP)\nbased labelings have been widely used in radio communication\nsystems. Gray labeling has been mainly used in bit interleaved\ncoded modulation (BICM) systems, and a detailed definition of\nGray labeling can be found in [10]. SP based labeling has been\nefficiently employed in [11] to directly improve Euclidean dis-\ntance structure of jointly designed coded modulation systems.\nIn general, any labeling map introduces some layer of unequal\nerror protection on the input bits. Gray labeling attempts to\nreduce unequal protection to a minimum level while SP based\nlabeling magnifies and utilizes this property. For instance in\n[12] and [13], SP has been applied to design a multi-level\ncoded modulation system with different layers of protection\nand where each layer is coded separately. Furthermore, it\nhas been shown in [14] that SP labeling provides better\nperformance than Gray labeling in BICM with ID (BICM-ID).\nIn this paper, we adopt a mixed strategy known as mixed-\nlabeling, where SP is performed only for the first stages and\nthen Gray labeling is used for each resulting sub-constellation.\nThis strategy creates a multi-layer modulation, as illustrated\nin Fig. 1, where a 16-level two-layer QAM with two bits per\nlayer, i.e., 16-TLQAM(m0=2,m1=2), is presented.\nWe define\nL =\n{\nm\u22121\u2211\nk=0\nuk2m\u22121\u2212k\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223uk \u2208 {0, 1}\n}\n(2)\nas the set of decimal label of \u03c7. In the example\nof mixed-labeling illustrated in Fig. 1, L =\n{12, 4, 14, 6, 0, 8, 2, 10, 13, 5, 15, 7, 1, 9, 3, 11} with respect to\n\u03c7 in (2). SP is applied for the first two stages resulting in\nfour sub-constellations shown by black dots in Fig. 1. Each\nsub-constellation is an offset equivalent 4-QAM modulation\nwith a minimum Euclidean distance reduces by a factor\n1.115 compared to a genuine 4-QAM modulation. The\nfirst two label bits (\u03c50, \u03c51) are used to select one of the\nsub-constellations and the last two label bits (\u03c52, \u03c53), which\nare assigned by using Gray labeling, are used to select a point\nin the chosen sub-constellation. This structure creates two\nlayered-streams composed of m0 = 2 bits, i.e., (\u03c50, \u03c51), and\nm1 = 2 bits, i.e., (\u03c52, \u03c53), respectively. It can be efficiently\nutilized in our novel DF-LHOM scheme. If bits (\u03c50, \u03c51) are\nperfectly forwarded through the R node, then the D node\nwould be aware of the selected sub-constellation and the\nuncertainty of the direct link, i.e., S-D link, would reduce to\nsub-constellation points. Effectively the source transmission\nwould appear as an equivalent 4-QAM modulation for the\nS-D link and as a 16-QAM for the S-R link.\nIII. SYSTEM MODEL FOR THE DF-LHOM SCHEME\nLet us assume a simple cooperative communication system\nwhich is composed of three nodes, namely one S, one R,\nand one D node. A further assumption is that the nodes\u2019\ntransmission-reception is based on a simple protocol composed\nof two phases. The S node broadcasts its signal to the R\nand D nodes in the first phase of this protocol, and in the\nsecond phase only the R node transmits to the D node. Even\nthough it would be more efficient to allow the S and R\nnodes to jointly transmit in the second phase as in [15],\nwe adhere to this simple protocol for the convenience of\nintroduction of the proposed approach. Phases I and II are\ncomposed of N1, and N2 symbol transmissions, respectively.\nIn phase I, the S node broadcasts signal sequence x1 =\n(x1,0, . . . , x1,N1\u22121), and in phase II, the R node transmits\nthe signal sequence x2 = (x2,0, . . . , x2,N2\u22121) to the D node,\nwhere xi,j \u2208 C. Frequency-flat fading channels are assumed\nbetween any pair of transmitting-receiving nodes and channel\nstate information of each link is assumed to be only known at\neach corresponding receiver node. The block diagram of our\nproposed DF-LHOM transmit cooperation scheme is depicted\nin Fig. 2. The exploited processing at the three nodes S, R,\nand D is illustrated in Fig. 2 (a), (b), and (c), respectively, and\nthe generic structure of the assumed Forward Error Correction\n(FEC) encoder is detailed in Fig. 2 (d).\nThe source node transmitter relies on a FEC encoder S to\nencode a sequence of bits u into a sequence of coded bits c =\n(c0, . . . , cN1\u22121). It uses an M -TLQAM(m0,m1) modulator to\nmap the sequence c to a vector of N1 complex symbols x1,\nwhere cj = (c(0)j , c\n(1)\nj ) is an m = (m0 + m1)-tuple of bits,\nwith c(0)j = (\u03c50, \u03c51) and c\n(1)\nj = (\u03c52, \u03c53) for M = 16, m0 = 2,\nand m1 = 2. Then, x1 is broadcasted at the same time towards\nthe R and D nodes. We assume as in [8] that the S-R link is a\nhigh-reliability link, and that the S-D is a link with a far lower\nreliability than the S-R link. On the one hand, the high-quality\nof the S-R link implies that the R node is able to reliably\ndecode the two bit sub-sequences c(0) and c(1), which are\nconveyed through the M -TLQAM(m0,m1) and represent the\ntwo layers of information. On the other hand, the low-quality\nof the S-D implies that the D node is able to decode the lower-\nlayer of information c(1) provided that in the mean time the\n2\n~lc\nP-level\ndemodulator\nDepunc.\u03a0SC-1SISOFEC Dec.

In other words, by using the layered modulation\nstructure, the sequence c is partially forwarded by the R node,\ni.e., only the c(0) part, and c(0) is used as auxiliary information\nat the D node to decode c(1).\nAt the receiver side of the R node, x1 is received as y0,\ndemodulated as c\u0302 and decoded as u\u0302. Following this step, u\u0302\nis re-encoded into c by using the same FEC encoder S that\nhas been used at the source. Our scheme requires only c(0)\nto be forwarded, therefore c(1) can be either fully punctured,\npartially punctured, or even compressed as in [7]. The stream\nof punctured coded-bits is then interleaved by using \u03a0SC,\nencoded via the FEC encoder R to protect v, and e is\nfinally mapped into a vector of symbols x2 by using a P -\nlevel modulation, e.g., QAM, and transmitted towards the D\nnode. Notice that the levels of modulation M and P can be\nadjusted independently. This makes our scheme fairly flexible\nin terms of data rate, which can be adapted in function of the\npropagation conditions. In comparison with DF, an additional\nFEC encoder S is required at the R node, which increases\nslightly its complexity. However, it forms with the interleaver\n\u03a0SC and the second FEC encoder R a serially concatenated\nencoding structure. This structure can be used to improve the\nperformance through ID at the receiver side [9].\nAt the receiver side of the D node, the signal received\nfrom the R node, y2, is demodulated as le\u0302, and decoded\nvia the Soft-Input Soft-Output (SISO) FEC decoder R as\nlv\u0302ex, where le\u0302 and lv\u0302ex are Log Likelihood Ratio (LLR)\nvalues. Afterwards, lv\u0302ex is de-punctured and de-interleaved\nas lc\u0302ex that contains the full upper-layer and the punctured\nlower-layer of information. This stream is used as extrinsic\ninformation in order to softly demodulate and de-map the\nstream y1 coming from the S node. The aggregated stream\nof LLR values lc\u02dc is finally decoded via a SISO FEC decoder\nS, and the output LLR stream lu\u02dc corresponding to the output\nbit sequence u\u02dc is obtained. In addition, the LLR values\nof lu\u02dc can be further refined by using ID. As a result of\nthe serially concatenated encoding structure implemented at\nthe relay, the D node is equivalent to a distributed serially\nconcatenated iterative decoder. At the end of the first iteration\npreviously described, the coded LLRs lc\u02dcex, which are provided\nby the SISO FEC decoder S, are punctured and interleaved\nas lv\u02dcex and are then fed back into the SISO FEC decoder R\nto perform the ID process. The complexity of this node is\nseemingly identical to its DF scheme counterpart. Notice that\nin contrast to the conventional serial concatenation decoder,\nthe considered iterative decoder is composed of three SISO\ncomponents, i.e., two for the FEC decoders S and R, and one\nfor the M -TLQAM(m0,m1) demodulator.\nIV. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS\nIn our simulations, we assume a single-tap Rayleigh fast\nfading channel with a normalized Doppler frequency of 100\nHz between the various links, S-D, S-R, and R-D. The FEC\nencoders S and R are half-rate (7,5)-CC with zero padding.\nAll the nodes have a single transmit\/receive antenna. We define\n\u0394S-R and \u0394R-D as the SNR offsets of the S-R and R-D\nlinks, respectively, according to the S-D link. We assume that\nthe S-R link is highly reliable compare to the S-D link and\nset \u0394S-R \u2265 10 dB. We also define \u03b3DF and \u03b3DF\u2212LHOM\nas the SNRs require by the DF and DF-LHOM schemes,\nrespectively, to achieve a given BER for fixed \u0394S-R and \u0394R-D\nvalues. The difference in dB between these two SNRs, i.e.,\nG \u0002 (\u03b3DF\u2212LHOM (dB)\u2212\u03b3DF (dB)), provides a measure of the\nSNR gain that our scheme can achieve in comparison with the\nconventional DF scheme [5]. Three types of labeling have been\nemployed at the S node, Gray, i.e., m0 = 0, m1 = m, mixed,\ni.e., m0 = m\/2, m1 = m\/2, and full SP (FSP), i.e., m0 = m,\nm1 = 0. For the case of M = 16, their respective decimal\nlabel sets can be expressed as\nLGray16 = {2, 6, 14, 10, 3, 7, 15, 11, 1, 5, 13, 9, 0, 4, 12, 8},\nLmixed16 = {0, 4, 2, 6, 8, 12, 10, 14, 1, 5, 3, 7, 9, 13, 11, 15},\nLFSP16 = {14, 6, 13, 5, 2, 10, 1, 9, 12, 4, 15, 7, 0, 8, 3, 11},\n3\n10\u22126\n10\u22125\n10\u22124\n10\u22123\n10\u22122\n\u221210\n\u22125\n0\n5\n\u22121.5\n\u22121\n\u22120.5\n0   \n0.5 \n1   \n1.5 \nBER\u0394R\u2212D (dB)\nG\n \n(dB\n)\nFig. 3. SNR gain of our DF-LHOM scheme compared to DF scheme\nfunctions of \u0394R-D and the BER, \u0394S-R = 10 dB, M = 16, P = 16.\naccording to \u03c7 in (2). For the case of M = 256, the label set\nLmixed256 is available at the end of the paper. Various punctur-\ning patterns Pi have been defined according to the modulation\nbased on mixed-labeling. If Pi is applied, then i bits among\nthe m1 bits of c(1)j for each symbol cj are punctured. For\ninstance, P0 means that no bits are punctured and Pm1 that c(1)\nis fully punctured. A P -QAM modulator with Gray labeling\nhas been used at the R node. The aggregated performance of\nour scheme, i.e., u vs. u\u02dc is evaluated for ID or non-ID. The\nperformances of DF-LHOM and DF schemes are compared\nfor the same data rate.\nIn Figs. 3 and 4, the SNR gain G functions of \u0394R-D and the\nBER is displayed for M = 16, m0 = 2, m1 = 2, \u0394S-R = 10\ndB and M = 256, m0 = 4, m1 = 4, \u0394S-R = 15 dB,\nrespectively. Moreover, P = 16, a full puncturing of c(1),\nand non-ID are assumed. First, the results show that our DF-\nLHOM scheme achieves a gain compare to DF scheme in\nbetween 0.5 to 1.5 dB at BER of 10\u22125 for \u0394R-D \u2208 [\u22128, 3]\nin the case of M = 16, and a gain in between 0.5 to 3\ndB at BER of 10\u22126 for \u0394R-D \u2208 [\u221220, 0] in the case of\nM = 256. Intuitively, the BER provides a measure of the\nreliability of the S-D link, since higher SNRs of the S-D\nlink are required to achieve a lower BER. We observe that\nfor high BERs, i.e., a low quality of the S-D link, and low\n\u0394R-D values, our scheme performs worst than DF scheme.\nIn this configuration, the reliability of c(0), which has been\nforwarded by the relay over the R-D link, is low and thus\nthe inaccuracy in the sub-constellation selection implies a\nsharp performance degradation. As the BER decreases, the\nquality of both the S-D and R-D links increases, then the sub-\nconstellation selection becomes more reliable, and our DF-\nLHOM scheme outperforms DF scheme. This result indicates\nthat the pre-selection of information is more efficient than\nthe simple combination in asymmetric link quality conditions.\n10\u22127\n10\u22126\n10\u22125\n10\u22124\n10\u22123\n10\u22122\n\u221220\n\u221215\n\u221210\n\u22125\n0\n\u22121\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\nBER\n\u0394R\u2212D (dB)\nG\n \n(dB\n)\nFig. 4. SNR gain of our DF-LHOM scheme compared to DF scheme\nfunctions of \u0394R-D and the BER, \u0394S-R = 15 dB, M = 256, P = 16.\nMoreover, as depicted in Figs. 3 and 4, our DF-LHOM scheme\ndoes not provide a constant gain for any \u0394R-D values, G drops\nsharply for very low BERs, i.e., high quality of the S-D link,\nand \u0394R-D > 0. In this case, the equivalent S-R-D link is highly\nreliable, then c(0) is highly reliable and the sub-constellation\nselection is highly reliable. However, c(1), which has been\npunctured at the relay, is not available at the destination for\nrefining c(1) that has been transmitted over the S-D link. Thus,\nour scheme misses c(1) at the D node to achieve the same\ndiversity and performance as DF scheme.\nIn Fig. 5, we compare the DF-LHOM and DF PER per-\nformances for \u0394S-R = 15 dB, \u0394R-D = \u221210 dB, M = 256,\nm0 = 4, m1 = 4, P = 16, a full puncturing of c(1), and\nID, i.e., 1,2 and 10 iterations (it.). Notice that we have used\nthe distributed parallel concatenation turbo decoder presented\nin [5] to obtain the results for DF scheme. The result shows\nthat our DF-LHOM scheme outperforms DF scheme for any\nnumber of iterations. However, the performance difference\nbetween the two schemes is lower for 10 iterations than for a\nsingle one, i.e., 0.7 dB instead of 1.2 dB at a PER of 10\u22123.\nIt indicates that the distributed parallel concatenation turbo\ndecoder of DF scheme is able to harvest more gain from\nthe ID process than the serial concatenation structure of our\ndecoder, but the multi-layer structure of our scheme is still\nmore efficient than the non-layer one used in DF.\nIn Fig. 6, we analyze the performance of the DF-LHOM\nscheme for different labelings, various puncturing patterns,\n\u0394S-R = 15 dB, \u0394R-D = \u221210 dB, M = 256, P = 16,\nand 10 iterations of the decoder. Notice that here we employ\nthe same puncturing pattern P4 defined according to mixed\nlabeling for every other labelings. The first three curves show\nthat our proposed mixed-labeling is the most efficient labeling\nin order to get the most gain out of the multi-layer modulation\nstructure, since it outperforms the Gray and FSP labelings by\n4\n10 12 14 16 18 20 22\n10\u22123\n10\u22122\n10\u22121\n100\nSNR (dB)\nPE\nR\n \n \nDF it.=1\nDF it.=2\nDF it.=10\nDF\u2212LHOM it.=1\nDF\u2212LHOM it.=2\nDF\u2212LHOM it.=10\nFig. 5.

These results\nare in line with the ones obtained in [14] for BICM-ID.\nMoreover, it can be observed by comparing the first, fourth,\nfifth and sixth curves that increases the number of punctured\nbits decreases the performance. However, the data rate of the\nsecond transmission phase can be double, i.e., using P4 instead\nof P0, by increasing the SNR of only 2 dB at a PER of 10\u22122.\nV. CONCLUSION\nA novel transmit cooperation scheme that benefits from\nasymmetric propagation conditions has been designed in this\npaper. A different approach to DF scheme has been followed to\ncreate a layered transmission format by using mixed-labeling\nin order to effectively exploit the capacity of both S-D and\nS-R links. In addition to the layered architecture, a distributed\nserially concatenated encoding structure has been designed\nto further improve the performance of our scheme. Several\nmixed-labeling patterns for different levels of modulation have\nbeen introduced. Performance analysis has shown that mixed-\nlabeling is efficient to take advantage of the asymmetric nature\nof the broadcast phase via the multi-layer modulation and to\neffectively exploit the ID through the distributed serially con-\ncatenated structure. As a result, this scheme is spectrally more\nefficient than DF scheme in asymmetric conditions. This paper\npresents promising preliminary results for our DF-LHOM\nscheme. In the future, these results will be complemented by\na thorough theoretical analysis.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis work has been performed in the framework of the FP7\nproject ROCKET IST-215282 STP, which is funded by the\nEuropean Community.\nREFERENCES\n[1] A.
