The\npapers have their origins in an 'expert' seminar\nheld at the International Centre for Learner\nManaged Learning at Middlesex University,\nLondon. The seminar brought together a group\nof practitioners (academic, training and media)\nfrom around the world to consider progress to\ndate and the future of learning and teaching\nonline. For the purposes of the book 'online' is\nunderstood to include 'electronic means of\ndistributing and engaging with learning' (ix)\nand only includes broadcast media to the degree\nthat they overlap with 'the overall internet\nscenario' (ix). According to the book details\nof the original seminar are available from\nhttp:llwww.iclml.mdx.acuk\/TLonline. Readers are\ninvited to contribute to online discussion. How-\never, at the time this review was written the Web-\nsite was unavailable.\nBefore glancing at the contents of the each of\nthe six sections, it should be noted that the\nstandard of the contributions to this collection is\nextremely high and, accordingly, it is really\nimpossible to acknowledge all of the valuable\npoints made by the various contributors.\nEach of the six sections addresses issues of\nonline pedagogy from a different perspective.\nEach is preceded by a brief introduction from\n106\nthe editor that very usefully encapsulates the\narguments presented and makes it much easier\nfor the reader to approach selectively the\ncontents of the collection. The six sections are:\n\u2022 'From theory to practice: the academics'. This\ncontains three papers primarily concerned\nwith pedagogy. All three take a strongly\nsituated view of the online learning experience\nas one that can increasingly empower the\nlearner.\n\u2022 'Researchers'. This presents two reviews of\ncurrent research literature on online learning.\nThe first of these, 'Online learning' (Coomey\nand Stephenson), focuses on case studies\nwhile the second 'Making the right\nconnections' (Jackson and Anagnostopou-\nlou), is concerned with the growing body of\nliterature related to online learning environ-\nments.\n\u2022 'Practitioners'. This is the largest section and\ncontains five papers by well respected workers\nin the field each reporting on specific aspects\nof their own experience. These include papers\non the role of the tutor in online learning,\n('Finding the tutor in post-secondary online\nlearning' (Bonk et al.)), issues in facilitating\nonline learning, 'Effective facilitation of on-\nline learning' (Mason), and the development\nof critical skills ('Exploring the development\nof critical thinking skills through a Web-\nsupported problem-based learning environ-\nment' (Oliver)).\n\u2022 'Transition'. The two papers in this section\nAll-J Volume 10 Number 3\nconcentrate on issues arising from integrating\nonline learning with more conventional\npractice. Both papers emphasize the need for\ncommitment and the careful management and\nstructuring of the learning experience. In\n'From conventional to distance education'\nWoodman et al. discuss the 'I CARE' system\nintroduced at Middlesex University (p. 154).\nThe acronym and the words it stands for -\nIntroduction, Connect, Apply, Reflect,\nExtend - are indicative of this emphasis on\nboth commitment and structure.\n\u2022 'Designers and producers'. These three papers\nreflect the concerns and interests of\ncommercial producers with respect to the\ndevelopment of an economically viable online\npedagogy. Given the financial pressures on\nhigher education (at least in the UK), these\npapers provide a valuable perspective from\nwhich to view the problem of developing\nhigh quality, pedagogically sound learning\nresources within the prevailing economic\nconstraints.\n\u2022 'The Vanguard'. The last two papers in the\ncollection look towards a future in which\ntelevision and the Internet have become\nmerged in an interactive digital medium that\ncan not only provide access to quality\nmultimedia learning resources, but also give\nlearners considerable power to manage their\nown learning. In 'Towards an androgogy\nfor living in an information society' Dickin-\nson and Stewart, for example, argue that\n'we already have the technology to make\ne-learning \"just for me, just in time\"'\n(p. 205).\nThis emphasis on learner-managed learning is\nreally the dominant theme of the book.\nCertainly the vision of the editor's endpiece is of\na future in which the learner's independence is\nabsolutely paramount. Although in the intro-\nduction Stephenson says that 'it is not assumed\n. . . that online learning will exist entirely without\ninteraction between teachers and learners or\nbetween learners and learners', the vision\npresented in his conclusion is one in which the\nteacher, at least as presently understood, has, if\nnot disappeared, certainly changed beyond all\nrecognition. It is a view that for many will not be\na welcome one; but, taking this collection as a\nwhole, the case is one that academia should con-\nsider seriously. For even if Stephenson's par-\nticular view is perhaps a little extreme, it is clear\nthat the future of teaching and learning online is\nlikely to call for a radically different conception\nof the roles of both teachers and learners.\nBruce Ingraham\nUniversity of Teesside\nIan McGill and Liz Beaty, Action Learning: A\nGuide for Professional, Management and\nEducational Development, Kogan Page, London,\n2001 (2nd edn). ISBN: 0-7494-3455-8. Softback,\n262 pages, \u00a322.50.\nAction Learning is a practical guide to action\nlearning in continuing professional develop-\nment, management development and higher\neducation. Described by the authors as a 'how\nto' book, it aims to be both an introduction to\naction learning for new users and a manual for\nfacilitators.\nThe book is organized into three parts: 'Doing\naction learning'; 'Developing action learning\nskills'; and 'The uses of action learning'. The\nreader is encouraged to take a route through the\nchapters appropriate to his or her needs \u2014 I chose\nthe suggested route for 'course organizers and\ndevelopers in higher education with little\nknowledge and experience of action learning'.\nThis took me on a non-sequential tour through\nall the chapters in Parts 1 and 2 (except,\ninterestingly, the chapter on being a facilitator),\nand directed me to the chapter specific to higher\neducation in Part 3.\nThe style of this book is very much a guide: the\nwriting is concise and easy to follow, sentences\nare short and explanations are clear. Personally I\nwould have preferred the exploration of some of\nthe issues presented in a little more depth, and it\nwould have been useful to have more case studies\nand illustrative material to show the techniques\ndescribed in practice and provide ideas and\ninspiration for my own implementation of\naction learning.\nAction learning involves a four-stage cycle of\nexperience, exploration and diagnosis, planning\nfor improvement and the implementation of\naction for testing in a new environment. The\nauthors see it firmly grounded in real issues and\nreal world problems, and stress the link with\nexperience throughout. Chapter 2 ('What is\naction learning?') provides clear definitions of\nthe terminology and scope of action learning,\nand compares action learning 'sets' with other\ntypes of group. There is a brief attempt to place\naction learning within the wider context of\nexperiential learning ideas. The authors' state\n107\nReviews\nthat 'belief in the power of the experiential\nlearning cycle is at the heart of our investment in\naction learning' (p. 20). I felt that this belief\nwarranted further exploration and justification.\nAt the very least pointers to further sources of\ninformation on experiential learning might be\nuseful for those 'new users' reading the book.\nChapter 3 ('How a set works') offers lots of very\npractical information useful for the complete\nbeginner. Using the book as a manual,\nexperienced facilitators might find some of the\ncomments rather too obvious. For example:\n'lecture rooms were sometimes found to have\ninappropriate furniture . . . and to be difficult to\nbook' (p. 34) and 'a change of scene over lunch\nat least provides the opportunity to take a walk\nto refresh from the intensity of the set process as\nmuch as for physical comfort' (p. 32). There are a\nvariety of comments in a similar style that do\nnot really add much to the understanding of\nhow a set works. This is a chapter where the use\nof case study material might have been\nparticularly beneficial.\nChapter 4 on the presenter's role provides\ninformation that has wider relevance. Tutorials,\none-to-one meeting with students and other\nsmall group encounters could all benefit from\nsome of the advice offered here on active\nlistening, effective questioning, support and the\ndevelopment of action plans.\nChapters 5 (being a facilitator) and 6 (types of\naction learning) continue the practical advice.\nThese are followed with a useful description of a\nworkshop that could be used to introduce action\nlearning (Chapter 7) and two (perhaps un-\nnecessarily split) chapters on the skills of group\nworking, listening, reflecting, giving feedback\nand articulating action plans that are essential to\nthe effective working of a set.\nThe review of action learning in higher\neducation presented in Chapter 13 advocates the\nuse of action learning as a student-centred\ntechnique, but, having raised the problem of\nlarge numbers of students in HE, fails to explain\nhow action learning sets could be implemented\nwithin the constraints of limited tutor resources.\nHowever, the role of action learning in advanced\nlevel, management and vocational situations is\nclear. Action learning is identified as a technique\nthat acknowledges the different starting points\nof learners and encourages reflection, and issues\nof assessment are usefully covered here.\nAs a distance and online learning tutor, I was\n108\nsomewhat surprised to read 'distance education\nis beginning to be a reality beyond the elaborate\nmechanisms of the Open University' (p. 230).\nHaving been involved with distance learning\nboth within and outside the Open University for\nover a decade I (and I hope many of the students\nwho have completed programmes of study)\nwould argue that distance education IS a reality\nnow and has been for quite some time! The\nauthors go on to offer comments on active\nlearning and technology - 'active learning can\nblend with new technologies in making more\neffective use of the contact time between student\nand teachers'. Again, it would have been nice to\nsee some examples of this in practice to provide\ninspiration for implementation. The questions\n'Is it possible to run a set through a virtual\nlearning environment?' (p. 238) is asked. The\nauthors consider that the answer is not clear, but\nthat this is an area 'ripe for research'. It will be\ninteresting to watch this particular aspect of\naction learning develop.\nIn summary, this is a practical 'how to' book,\nprobably better for the 'new user' than the\nexperienced 'facilitator'. It is easy to read,\nalthough enhanced use of case studies and\nexamples would be useful to support and supple-\nment the content. Other aspects of the book that\ndeserve attention are the glossary (currently\nthere are five entries!), and suggestions for\nsources of further information. As a 'new user' I\nfelt that clearer pointers to further sources of\ninformation and examples (including Websites)\nwere also lacking, but the book has certainly\nencouraged me to find out more about\nexperiences with action learning and to explore\nsome of its ideas in my own teaching. The\nauthors caution that you can become 'hooked'\non action learning. They are clearly enthusiasts\nwith tremendous experience in the area, and\nthere is advice in this book to benefit all\nconsidering or using action learning.\nSarah Cornelius\nAberdeen\nPeter Jarvis (ed.), The Age of Learning:\nEducation and the Knowledge Society, Kogan\nPage, London. 2001. ISBN: 0-7494-3412-0.\nSoftback, 230 pages, \u00a319.99.\nOver recent years, 'learning' has moved to the\nforefront of the educational agendas of many\ncountries of the world. Terms such as 'the\nlearning organization', 'the learning society',\n'the knowledge society', 'lifelong learning' and\nAlt-] Volume 10 Number 3\nso on are now familiar to most educators. Such\nterms tend to litter government policy and\nstrategy papers and raise considerable debate\nwithin the academic literature. This book seeks\nto explore the issues surrounding these themes\nand provide a multidisciplinary analysis of the\nkey features of learning in contemporary society.\nThe book is edited by Peter Jarvis who is\nprofessor of Continuing Education and\nconvenor of the Centre for Research in Lifelong\nLearning at the University of Surrey, UK. The\nbook has nine other contributing authors, all of\nwhom are members of the same Centre.\nThe book contains a total of eighteen chapters\nthat are logically organized into the following\nfive broad sections:\n1. The emergence of the learning society\n(Chapters 1 to 3).\n2. Learning and the learning society (Chapters 4\nto 6).\n3. The mechanics of the learning society\n(Chapters 7 to 9).\n4. Implications of the learning society (Chapters\n10 to 14).\n5. Reflections on the age of learning (Chapters\n15 to 18).\nEach chapter is individually referenced as one\nmight expect from a text with multiple\ncontributing authors. A detailed subject index is\nalso included.\nChapter 1 presents a historical overview of the\nmain developments of adult and vocational\neducation in the twentieth century, and how\nthese relate to the linked concepts of the learning\nsociety, lifelong learning and the learning age.\nThis 'context setting' theme is continued in\nChapter 2 which examines these concepts from\nsocial, economic and political perspectives. It\nlooks at the consequences of globalization, the\nemergence of the new knowledge-based eco-\nnomy, and the effects of information and com-\nmunication technology (ICT) on education,\nemployment and the labour market. Chapter 3\nconcludes this first section of the book by\nexamining various changes in educational theory\nand practice over the last three decades or so -\nparadigm shifts that have reshaped curricula\ndesign and delivery, the relationship between\neducator and learner, and society's views on the\nrole of education. This first section succeeds in\nproviding a comprehensive and informative\noverview of the issues relating to the emergence\nof the learning society.\nPart 2 of the book ('Learning and the learning\nsociety') begins by considering the implications\nof lifelong learning in terms of social, economic\nand political policy analysis. It goes on to\nexamine strategies for lifelong learning in\nrelation to culture, leisure and lifestyle, and\nconcludes by arguing that education policy-\nmaking is being superseded by lifelong learning\nstrategy-formation. Chapter 5 presents a\nphilosophical analysis of the various definitions\nand models of the learning society that have\nemerged over the last few decades. In particular,\nit focuses upon the cultural values\/humanistic\nmodel of Hutchins; the futurological\/techno-\nlogical model developed by Husen; and Boshier's\ndemocracy\/participation\/citizenship model. This\nphilosophical examination is continued in\nChapter 6 where a distinction is drawn between\nlifelong learning and education. It adopts a\nperson-centred view of lifelong learning that is\nconcerned essentially with achieving self-\nfulfilment through one's own efforts. It argues\nthat within today's consumer society, the\nresources of the Web bring significant advantage\nto the autonomous self-directed learner.\nChapter 7 opens the next section of the book\n('The mechanics of the learning society') by\nconsidering how lifelong learning can be paid\nfor. It rightly draws attention to the difficulties in\ndoing so as a consequence of the diverse ways\nand reasons why post-initial education and\ntraining is currently funded. It asks the question\n'who should pay?' and considers this from the\nperspective of the state, the employer and the\nindividual. It looks at various government\ninitiatives set in place over the last two decades\nto address this issue, and concludes by echoing\nthe repeated call for a more coherent and\nconsistent policy framework for funding lifelong\nlearning. Chapter 8 examines the theme of work-\nrelated learning which, in relation to UK\ngovernment policy, is an important element of\nthe lifelong learning agenda. It highlights some\nof the problems in defining work-related\nlearning and goes on to consider how\ncontemporary ideas about it have emerged.\nAttention is also given to the notion of the\n'learning organization' - a concept developed\nover the last 10-15 years. This leads on to a\nthought-provoking discussion on whether work-\nrelated learning can be viewed as a form of\nregulation and control. Chapter 9 closes this\nsection of the book with a critical overview of\n109\nReviews\neducational and vocational guidance services\nand their key role in facilitating access to\nlearning. It draws attention to the relative\nscarcity of literature on the subject and suggests\na number of emerging areas of research interest\nfor the topic.\nPart 4 of the book ('Implications of the learning\nsociety') begins by examining the implications of\nthe learning society for education beyond\nschool. It does so from the perspectives of the\nhigher education sector, further education, and\nadult or continuing education. It suggests that\nthe development of the learning society will\ndemand the dissolution of the artificial barriers\nbetween these three sectors, and sees a\nprominent role for ICT in achieving this aim.\nChapter 11 discusses what the 'age of learning'\nmeans for our systems of mass schooling and\nconsiders how schools shape the age of learning\nand vice versa. It asks to what extent lifelong\nlearning might be considered compulsory and\npoints to professionals such as lawyers, doctors\nand nurses for whom continuing professional\ndevelopment is a requirement to remain in\npractice. This discussion leads nicely into\nChapter 12 where the focus of attention is on the\nrole of corporations and professions in the\nlearning age. It examines how the ongoing\ntraining requirements of the workforce in the\nnew knowledge society have changed and points\nto the rise of the 'corporate university' as one of\nthe means to address this. However, most of this\ndiscussion draws upon literature from the USA\nas there appears to be little published research\non the topic in the UK. Chapter 13 considers the\nimplications for the delivery of learning\nmaterials and, as one might expect, the role of\nICT is the main focus of this debate. The\ndiscussion is nicely balanced between the\npotential of ICT and its likely limitations, and\nthe key issues are addressed in a very pragmatic\nway. However, despite the wealth of published\nliterature on some of these key topics, few\nreferences find their way into the discussion.\nChapter 14 ends this section of the book by\nlooking at the important issue of including the\nsocially excluded in the learning age. Four main\nthemes are addressed: adult basic education;\nEuropean social policy and social exclusion;\nsocial capital and citizenship; education and\nsocial purpose. It rightly concludes that the issue\nis complex and one that remains a challenge for\nthose who form policy.\nThe last section of the book ('Reflections on the\nage of learning') begins by examining the topic\nof the public recognition of learning. It seeks to\nexplore what it describes as the paradoxical\nrelationship between the private nature of\nlearning and that of public society. There is a\nstark warning evident here of the increasing\nemphasis on 'certificated learning' as 'real\nlearning' - that the actual human process of\nlearning is becoming regarded as less important\nthan the achievement of the certificate that\nasserts it has taken place. Chapter 16,\n'Questioning the learning society', draws upon\nthe work of Illich and Verne to open the\ndiscussion. There are very clear social and moral\nmessages in this chapter and it is one of the few\nthat makes direct cross-reference with earlier\nchapters. Chapter 17 continues the social theme\nby exploring the relationship between learning\nand key concepts such as citizenship, civil\nsociety, democracy, community and social\ncohesion. It concludes that, even at the national\nlevel, our current understanding of the issues is\nstill in its infancy and key questions remain\nunanswered. Chapter 18 ends the book by\nconsidering the future directions for the learning\nsociety. We return once again to the themes of\nglobalization and the rise of the corporations.\nThis chapter nicely pulls together many of the\nissues raised earlier in the book and leaves us\nwith a thought-provoking vision of the future.\nThe scope of this book is very broad and seeks\nto provide a comprehensive overview of the key\nissues of learning in contemporary society. At\ntimes I wondered whether its scope was, in fact, a\nlittle too broad as its critical examination moved\nfrom one perspective to another and I juggled\nwith social, political, economic and philosoph-\nical themes. Whilst each chapter is undeniably\ninformative, some had greater appeal than\nothers and provided more stimulating and\nthought-provoking reading. Having said this, it\nis a text that will be of interest to many people\nand I would recommend it to anyone who seeks\nto understand better the issues that concern\nlifelong learning in today's society.\nNorman Woolley\nUniversity of Glamorgan\nSarah Gash, Effective Literature Searching for\nResearch, Gower, Aldershot, 2000. ISBN:\n0-566-08125-3. Softback, 133 pages, \u00a312.95.\nFor many of those just starting out, literature\nsearching is a complex skill that can seem very\njargon-filled, daunting and mysterious; even\nhardened searchers may have gained their skills\n110\nAlt-J Volume 10 Number 3\nthrough 'on-the-job' experience and may not\nhave a full knowledge of searching intricacies.\nThis book aims to guide new researchers,\nincluding undergraduate and postgraduate\nstudents in academia and those involved in\nresearch and development organizations,\nthrough the techniques of planning a literature\nsearch, finding and using search tools, keeping\nrecords of search results, obtaining and\nevaluating the material found, and writing\nreferences for record and citing in written\ndocuments. The book builds on the first edition\n(published under the title Effective Literature\nSearching for Students), to include information\non new resources such as online (including CD-\nROM) and Internet search tools.\nChapter 1, 'Why search?', discusses what literat-\nure searching is in broad terms and why\nsearching is useful in both academic and other\nindustries. In addition to setting the scene and\nthe philosophy of the book, the chapter\ndescribes how searchers can use libraries and\nlibrary staff to help with searching and finding\nliterature.\nThe main eight chapters of the book fall broadly\ninto two sections. Chapters 2-5 are concerned\nwith the mechanics of carrying out a literature\nsearch and gaining search results. Chapters 6-9\nconcentrate on what to do with the search\nresults: how to record what search was carried\nout and what results were found, and how to\nobtain, evaluate, and reference the material for\nresearch purposes.\nWithin the chapters concerned with the\nmechanics of literature searching, 'Preparing the\nsearch' (Chapter 2) explains how to become\nconversant with common terms used within the\nsearch topic, describes common terminology\nused in literature searching (for example,\ntreatises, monographs, electronic journals and\ntheses), and how to write a search profile.\n'Sources and tools' (Chapter 3) lists and\ndescribes six stages of literature searching using,\nin turn, library catalogues, book bibliographies,\nabstracting and indexing journals, current\nawareness services, special indexes (for example,\nindexes of patents, theses or official publica-\ntions), and, finally, institutions and people. The\ntype of documents that can be found in each\nstage are described and examples (with\nreferences) of the sources of information are\ngiven. Chapter 4, 'Electronic sources I - online\nsearching', provides a history of the\ndevelopment of online information retrieval,\ndescribes 'the modern online industry' and\ndiscusses the advantages and disadvantages of\nonline searching (online here usually excludes\nInternet-based searches). This chapter also\ncontains information on how online searches\nwork, and how the databases are structured as\neither bibliographic, dictionary or inverted files.\nProbably most usefully, Chapter 4 includes\ninformation on combining search terms using\nBoolean or logical operators. Finally in this\ninformal section, Chapter 5, 'Electronic sources\nII - the Internet', describes search tools and\nresources available over the Web. Here, Gash\ndescribes different types of search engines, such\nas automated search engines (including Altavista\nand Lycos), subject-specific gateways, and meta\nsearch engines. Useful tips for Internet searching\nare given and, at the end of the chapter, Gash\nprovides a comparison of online versus Internet\nsearching.\nThe final set of chapters (6 to 9) are concerned\nwith how to use and record the results of a\nliterature search. 'Keeping records' (Chapter 6),\nsuggests how one might record the searches\nmade and the references found. Gash compares\nthe advantages and disadvantages of keeping\npaper or computer-based records and discusses\nhow to organize photocopies of the material\nfound. Chapter 7, 'Obtaining and evaluating\nmaterial', covers issues such as locating and\nvisiting other libraries, interlibrary loans,\ncopying and copyright, and scanning material.\nThis chapter also contains a short section on\nevaluating material for its usefulness and\nrelevance to the search topic. In 'Writing\nreferences' (Chapter 8), Gash explains how there\nare many referencing styles used by different\ninstitutions. She then proceeds to give an\nexample of how to write references (including\nthose for books, journal articles, conference\nproceeding, patents, and electronic documents)\nusing a style based on the British Standard 1692.\nThe final chapter, 'Citing references in the text',\nis concerned with how material should be\nreferred to where it is used in written documents.\nDifferent methods of citing references are\ndescribed including footnotes, chronological and\nnumerical methods, and the use of 'ibid.' and\n'op. cit.'.\nThis is a very practical book and guides the new\nliterature searcher through the pitfalls of\nsearching in an informative and accessible way.\nGood practice tips are given throughout.\nAlthough I have carried out many literature\nsearches myself, I felt I learned something from\nIII\nReviews\nthe book and will be trying to incorporate some\nof the tips into my everyday practice. This book\nfeels as if it is written by an expert enthusiast,\nwishing to impart her knowledge and love of the\ntopic to her readers. Gash's book avoids over-\nspecialization and is not aimed at any particular\nstyle or field of literature searching. Because of\nthis, the general advice it offers will be of\nconsiderable use to new searchers from any\ndiscipline, student or worker, in academia or in\nindustry.\nKelly Smith\nUniversity of Birmingham\nAnn Hodgson (ed.), Policies, Politics and the\nFuture of Lifelong Learning, Kogan Page,\nLondon, 2000. ISBN: 07494-3202-0. Softback,\n210 pages, \u00a319.99.\nThe increasing linkage between the idea of a\nLearning Society and e-learning makes the issue\nof policy and politics an important focus of\nattention for everyone interested in learning\ntechnology. The idea of lifelong learning\nremains an idea that needs to be taken seriously.\nThis book is a useful and accessible introduction\nto the contemporary political and policy land-\nscapes in this area for ALT-J readers. The book\nintroduces readers to the national and inter-\nnational context of policy in relation to lifelong\nlearning but it can be read as an introduction to\neducational policy more broadly. Though largely\nUK-based, the chapters place national develop-\nments in a firmly European perspective.\nThe book is part of a series, 'The Future of\nEducation from 14+', and begins with a short\nand very useful editor's preface. An introductory\nchapter written by the editor of the book sets the\ndiscussion in a historical as well as national\ncontext. Ann Hodgson argues that the approach\nadopted by New Labour, the Third Way\npositioned between free markets and state-led\nregulation, differs from the previous\nConservative policies but remains distant from\nthe social partnership model. The chapter\nperiodizes the debates about lifelong learning\ninto decades, becoming a focus of international\ndebate in the 1970s, put on hold in the 1980s and\nre-emerging in the policy debates of the 1990s. I\nfound the historical account very useful in\nclarifying my own thoughts, even when they\ndiffered from those of the author. I am sure\nreaders of this journal will find the framework\nshe offers equally useful for clarifying their\nthoughts on policy issues.\n112\nThe remainder of the book is organized in three\nmain sections that examine: 1. European\ncontext, 2. Challenges in the UK context, and 3.\nThe policy focus under New Labour. In Part 1\nMarc Ant (Chapter 2) examines vocational\ntraining and the developing European institu-\ntions. Anyone who has ever been bemused by the\ncomplexity of EU policy should read this\nchapter as it uses the example of vocational\neducation to shed light on the general European\npolicy terrain. Andy Green (Chapter 3) outlines\nthree broad policy approaches to the Learning\nSociety and lifelong learning; state-led (France),\nsocial partnership (Germany) and market drive\n(UK). Both chapters are informative though I\ndid wonder how relevant national comparisons\nare at a time of increasing pressures towards a\ndiminished role for the state and the global\nintegration of capital. Given the European focus\nof the chapters and the role of the European\nCommission in promoting harmonization and\nconvergence, perhaps a more forward-looking\napproach would abandon the elaboration of\nnational policy types.\nPart 2 deals with challenges in the UK context.\nIt begins with a very timely chapter examining\nwidening participation. Some of these issues are\nhighly topical, both in terms of redrawing the\nHE map and in integrating more students in\naccredited courses who have previously not\nparticipated in education or training. The\nchapter notes the shift in policy towards blaming\nthe individual for non-participation and\nexclusion and away from the effects of broader\nsocial trends and issues. Gareth Williams\n(Chapter 5) suggests individual funding for\nlifelong learning and specifically argues for the\nuse of flexible learning packages using new\ntechnology. A potential problem with his\napproach is that he believes that significant\nefficiency gains can be obtained in this way. The\nrecent history of learning technology would\nsuggest that efficiency gains made in this way\nimpoverish the experience of learning. An even\nmore vain hope is expressed in this chapter when\nWilliams explains that: 'In the long run, the\nmarket for learning will ensure that the Internet\nassumes its proper place.' I am tempted to follow\nKeynes in making the remark that in the long\nrun we are all dead.\nLouise Morley (Chapter 6) criticizes the bureau-\ncracy and audit culture that pervade education\nand questions whether quality regimes adopted\nfrom industry are appropriate for the academy.\nThis chapter is couched in the language of\nAlt-J Volume 10 Number 3\ndiscourse, which I find personally uncongenial.\nNevertheless the issues covered by this chapter,\naudit culture, quality and equality are extremely\nimportant and the chapter is very thought-\nprovoking. Michael Young (Chapter 7) argues\nthat policies for lifelong learning need a concept\nof the curriculum and that central to that\ncurriculum will be a sense of what people will\nneed to know in the future. His argument is that\nthe debate needs to shift from access and\nparticipation towards pedagogy and knowledge.\nPart 3 examines the policy focus under New\nLabour. These chapters provide detailed\naccounts of several aspects of New Labour\npolicy. Ken Spours examines the National\nQualifications Framework and goes on to\ncontrast the English approach with the examples\nset in Scotland and Wales. Simon James\n(Chapter 9) argues for a more regional approach,\nwhich he argues aligns more closely with the\nEuropean context. Norman Lucas (Chapter 10)\nargues that further education colleges will need\nto focus more clearly on the needs of adult\nlearners and specialized vocational education\nand training. The implication of this approach is\nthat institutions for 16\u201419 year olds would need\nto concentrate en a more general education.\nAlison Fuller (Chapter 11) suggests that govern-\nment should give increased emphasis and\nresourcing to part-time higher education pro-\nvision. Greg Light (Chapter 12) is also con-\ncerned with higher education and comments on\nthe concept of professionalism that is developing\naround the Institute of Learning and Teaching.\nThe concluding chapter written by Ann Hodgson\nand Ken Spours is an appraisal of the current UK\npolicy and an assessment of how far this\napproach might meet the challenge of the twenty-\nfirst century. In current policy terms lifelong\nlearning is an umbrella term for post-compulsory\neducation but this chapter questions the limits of\ncurrent policy and its focus on learning after the\nage of 16. The idea of 'all throughness' is pro-\nposed as an additional focus for government\npolicy. All throughness would envisage learning\nfrom an early age addressing barriers caused by\nsocial division and developing the personal\ncapacity of individuals in a learning community.\nThe debate about just what lifelong learning\nmight mean has taken on an increased relevance\nin the UK as it appears that the government may\nredefine the FE\/HE boundary to meet its own\ntargets for participation rates (Times Higher\nEducation Supplement, 26 October 2001). The\nlink between student numbers and lifelong\nlearning is also central to the current HEFCE\nconsultation 01\/62. Overall I found this book a\nvery useful guide to the background of current\npolicy for lifelong learning. I would recommend it\nto anyone with a need to develop an\nunderstanding of issues in this area.\nChris Jones\nUniversity of Lancaster\n113\n"}
