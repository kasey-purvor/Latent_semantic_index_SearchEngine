INTRODUCTION \nIn a CDMA system, all users interfere with each others. \nTherefore the CDMA system is interference Iimited. The \nusers, which suffer from a strong shadow effect or because \nthey are far away from the BS, need more power to reach the \nlatter. In this case, theses users may transmit at their \nmaximum allowed power without satisfjmg their Quality of \nService. Therefore, this would leave some mobiles out of the \nsystem and also create too much interference to the \nneighboring cells. \nOne-way to counter this problem and therefore to improve \nthe capacity would be to increase the numbers of BS. But this \nsolution cannot be efficient as it increases significantly the \nnetwork infkastructure cost, Another way to improve the \ncapacity is a system applying relaying [I]. This means using \nother existing terminals located between the originating \nterminal and the BS for the purpose of retransmitting the \noriginal packet. With this process, the users at the boundaries \nof the cells will need less power to reach the relay station than \nto reach the BS and therefore create less interference to the \nneighboring cells, hence improving the capacity. \nIn the last few years, there has been a great interest in \ncellular networks applying relaying. First, ODMA \n(Opportunity Driven Multiple Access), which i s  an inteIligent \nprotocol that sits upon a radio sub-system that support \nrelaying, was proposed. One node relays its packets through \nothers nodes by using ODMA with a separate unpaired \nspectrum band and the node the closer to the BS sends the \npacket by using the TD\/CDMA-FDD mode [11. The A d  Hac \nGSM cellular system adds the relay capability to a second \ngeneration GSM network to enhance the system coverage [2]. \nThe i C A R  system can eficiently balance traffic toads between \ncells by using fixed relay station to relay trafic [3]. \nThe system proposed in this paper is based on a two-hop \nreIay cellular network. In this work, the relay stations are the \nmobile station non-communicating with the BS. The positive \npoint of using MS as reIay is with a great number of users in \nthe system, a MS has more chance to choose an appropriate \nMS relay. With fixed relay station, the users far away may \nhave difficulties to reach the fixed relay station. If a MS \nreIays its packet through another MS, it can considerably \ndecrease the battery of the MS relay. One solution to this \nproblem would be to employ cars or taxi as relay station, \nsince they have infinite battery. In this system, the air \ninterface WCDMA FJID is used for the two hops. With the \ncurrent technology this is not apphable, because wireless \nterminals cannot transmit and receive in the same frequency \nband in the mode FDD. However some changes can be made \nat the hardware of the mobile, like using twwduplexer, in \norder to apply it in the single mode FDD. Also it can be \ninteresting to see if the capacity is improved even by using a \nsingle mode, which is the worse case, because each hop \ninterferes with each other. Section II describes the system \nmodel proposed. Section III explains the different schemes to \nmodel relaying. The results are shown in section IV. And \nfinally, a conclusion is given in section V. \nD. MULTI-HOP BASED CELLULAR NETWORKS \nA.  System description \nThe Figure 1 (a) and (b) depict the scenario of the simulation \nmodel. The Figure l(a) shows the MS active and non-active \nin a single cell without relaying. The MS active are sending \ncontinuously data information to the BS.

In \nthis model, one MS relay can relay only one MO. With this \nscenario, at each instant the performance of the system with \nand without relaying can directly be compared for the same \nposition for all users. \n(a) Without relaying (b) With relaying \nFig. 1. Simulation model \nB. System model \nA MS is in outage if its SIR (Signal-toInterference ratio) is \nbelow a certain threshold. At any time, the SIR of all \nMS active can be calculated. If G denote the gain, P denote \nthe transmitter power and the uplink measured intracell and \nintercell interference at the BS i are denoted by and \nI;nleFcell respectively, the average SIR of user U is: \nwhere I;ntruce,\/ I GVq7 , with N' represents the number \njs i  \nof users that belong to - the BS i ;  and \nAA A Y  '. \nG t  ercell =zxGjkek,  with N\" the number of users that \nm#i k-1 \nbelong to the BS in, and M the number of cell in the system. \nn, represents the background noise. \nIf the received SIR of a MS is below its SIR threshold, this \nMS is considered in outage. This means that the signal of the \nMS is not strong enough to overcome the interference \nreceived by the BS. \nIn order to compare the two systems, with and without \nrelaying, the SIR of the links MI-BS, MO-MS relay and MS \nrelay-BS need to be calculated. As the MIS and the MSs relay \nsend their signal to the BS they have the same interferers, and \ntheir SIR can be expressed as: \ni where ' L,<jq and I$o represent the intracell \ninterference at the BS i respectively fiom the MI, MS relay \nand MO from the same cell. \nIf the MO U sends its signal to the MS relay r within the \ncell of the BS i, its SIR can be expressed as: \ni and represent the inuacell \ninterference at the MS relay r respectively from the MI, MS \nrelay and MO in the cell of the BS i. \ni \nwhere 'r,M1 3 Ir,Ms,+ \nIII. MULTI-HOP RELAYING SCHEMES \nIn this section, three different issues on a two-hop cellular \nnetwork are discussed. In the part A, improving the link \nbetween the terminah by applying power control is presented. \nThe MS relay selection, based on the SIR and the distance, is \ndiscussed in the part E. Finally in part C ,  possible methods to \nreduce the number of relayed MS are discussed. \nPower contro! between MS and MS relay A. \nUntil nowadays, few have considered in the literature to adapt \nthe transmit power between two MSs, communicating with \neach other. Here, it is considered the case where MO is \ncapable of adjusting its transmit power according to its \nreceived SIR at the MS relay. A perfect distributed power \ncontrol has been modeled for the links between MS and BS \nand also between MS and MS relay. The power control \nobjective between MS and MS relay is similar than traditional \npower control algorithms used in CDMA-based cellular \nsystems. It consists of balancing all the received SIR around \nthe SIR target value, [4]. Power control is performed in \nsubsequent iterations and the transmitter power P:*+') of \neach user U is adjusted at iteration n+l according to \np;n+u = __ r pl'\"' \n(4) \nwhere y:n) is the measured SIR of the link at iteration n and \nr is the target SIR for the link. \nY? \n266 \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

In [SI the criteria to determine the routing \nis based on minimizing interference. In this paper, a new \nalgorithm based on the maximum SIR overall and on the \ndistance between users is introduced. Within a certain range, \neach MO will choose the MS non-active With the maximum \nSIR overall as a MS relay. \nC. 1. Relay MS in the overlap area \nThe figure 2 shows the CDF (Cumulative Distribution \nFunction) of the distance between me MO and the BS. The \ncurve shows that most of the MOs are far away from the BS. \n70% of the MOs are distant from above 1600m. The MO \ncannot counter the loss along the path and reach the BS even \nwith the maximum power. Not only the signal received at the \nBS is weak but also they create a lot of intercell interference \nby using their maximum power. \nFig. 2. CDF of distance between MO and 3 s  (m) \na) Unly MO \nBy relaying only the MOs far away from the BS, not only the \nintercell interference will decrease but also the SIR of MO not \nin the overlap area will increase and some of them may not be \nin outage without the need of relaying (see Fig. 3). \nb) AIE MS active \nThere are some MS active in the overlap area, which are \nnot in outage, but because of a high propagation loss, they \ntransmit with a great power. Therefore, they create also a lot \nof interference to the neighboring cells. These MS active, \neven if they are not in outage, can be relayed in order to use \nless transmit power and therefore decreasing the intercell \ninterference. A new scheme is proposed where all the MS \nactive (in outage and not in outage) in the overlap area are \nrelayed. \nC.2. Reluy MS with SIR < SIR-ref \nA final scheme analyzed in this paper, proposes to relay \nonly the MOs, which have the lowest received SIR. For this, a \nnew threshoId SIR-reference is defined that is lower than the \nSIR target. The idea is to relay only the MOs with a SIR \nbelow the SIR-reference. With this process, the SIR of the \nMOs not relayed can be increased and theses MO can achieve \nthe target when relaying is done for onIy the MOs with a SIR \nbelow the SII-reference. \nFig. 3. Relaying only MO in the overlap area \nIv. SIMULATION RESULTS \nA. Simulation Environment \nCell planning is an important issue when relaying needs to be \nimplemented in cellular networks. The overlap area between \nneighboring cells should be kept to the minimum so that the \nsystem experiences minimum interference. Therefore a link \nbudget for the vehicular environment, as in 161, is performed \nin order to find the most accurate value for the radius of the \ncell. \nThe system modeled includes 19 hexagonal cells of radius \n2000m, with BS at the center of the cells employing omni \ndirectional antenna. The MS follow the mobility and the \npropagation model as proposed in [7] for the vehicular \nenvironment and for the hard handover case. A new auto \ncorrelated shadowing model in 2 dimensions is modeled \nbetween the MS and the BS, as in [SI. There are no \nappropriate path loss models that describe the channel \nbetween MS since a mobile terminal is usually positioned \naround head. However, the Lee model, which takes account \nthe receivers antenna height, is chosen as model 191. \nThe model is simulated at system level and the simulation has \nbeen run for 10000 iterations. The simulation resuIt is based \non outage probability, which represents the number of MS in \noutage over the total number of MS active for each cell. At \nthe end of the simulation, the outage probability calculated \nafter each time with and without relaying for the seven \ncentral cells are averaged and compared. \nB. Results \nFigure 4 shows the outage probability with and without \nrelaying for different number of active users in each cell. \nThe results show that the outage probability decreases when \nrelaying is applied. For instance, at 10% of outage \nprobability, the number of active users supported in the cell \nwithout relaying i s  28 but with relaying (No W) it is 32, \nwhich shows an improvement of 14%. In this case, the MO \nI )  PC between MS-MS relay \n267 \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on May 12,2010 at 15:40:06 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \ntransmit to the MS relay with the same fixed power, which is \nthe maximum power allowed. Relaying with power control \nbetween MS shows a significant improvement of 32%. For \n10% outage probability, the number of users active with \nrelaying and with power control supported is 37. With power \ncontrol between the MS, the MO will transmit with the \nminimum power needed to reach its MS relay. \nFig. 4. Outage probability vs. Number of users active per cell \nwith power control between MSs \n2) Interference study \nSimulations have been performed to study the intracell and \nintercell interference with and without relaying. The \ninterference ratio (intercelllintrace11 interference) calculated \nwithout relaying is approximately 1.7, which is in agreement \nwith [IO] for the hard handover case. The intracell \ninterference is increased from -1 17.2 dB to -116.6 dB when \nrelaying is applied. With relaying, the MS relay, which relays \nthe MO, can achieve the target and then send a stronger \nsignal to the BS than the MO without relaying, which \nincrease the intracell .interference. On the other hand, since \nsmaller distances need to be covered when relaying is applied, \nthe intercell interference is decreased kom -121.1 dB to -123 \ndB . \n3) MS relay selection schemes \nA new selection scheme based on highest SIR overall and the \ndistance between the MO and the MS relay has been tested. \nIn this algorithm, the MO finds a MS relay within a certain \nrange and selects the one with the highest SIR for the t w e  \nhop relay. Figure 5 shows the outage probability without \nrelaying, with relaying based on the highest SIR overall \nwithout range and with different allowed ranges (maximum \ndistance) of 500m, lOOOm and 1500m. This figure shows a \nsignificant improvement when the relay selection scheme is \nbased on the maximum SIR and distance. When the \nmaximum distance to find a MS relay is set to 1500m, the \nMO can easily find a MS relay in this range but the distance \nis still too large in order for the system to operate efficiently. \nWith the maximum distance set to 500m, the entire MO may \nnot be able to find a MS relay in that range and will select a \nMS relay far away which will lead to high transmission \npower. A good compromise has been found to be \napproximately 1000m. All MO will be able to find a MS relay \nin this range, which is half of the cell radius. For 10 % outage \nprobability, the number of active users supported in a cell \nwith the relay selection scheme based on the overall highest \nSIR and the distance between the MO and the MS relay is 5 1 \n(with maximum distance=lOOOm), which leads to a \nsignificant improvement of 82%. \nFig, 5. Outage probability vs. Number of users active per cell \nwith different range to find a MS relay \n4 )  Relaying only MO in the overlap area \nFigure 6 shows the outage probability in terms of the number \nof active users without relaying, with relaying all MS active \nin the overlap area, with relaying only MO that are in the \noverlap area, with relaying only MO with SIRCSIR-reference \nand with relaying all MO. \nThe results show that the performance is better when \nrelaying is performed for all the MO, and not only the MO in \nthe overlap area. For instance for 10% outage probability, the \nnumbers of active users in a cell with relaying only MO in the \noverlap area is 33, but with relaying all MO it's 51. There are \nsome MO close to the BS that achieve communication \nwithout relaying because the intercell interference is \ndecreased but not all of them since the intracell interference is \nincreased with relaying. \nThe radius of the circle that defines the overlap area is an \nimportant factor. The bigger the circle is, the less relaying \nwill be performed and the outage probability with relaying \nonly MO in the overlap area will be equal to the outage \nprobability without relaying. But the smaller is the circle, the \nmore relaying will be performed and the outage probability \nwith only MO relaying in the overlap area will be equal to the \noutage probability with relaying. \nEven if the performance is better with relaying for all MO, \nit may be interesting to model these schemes in a system \nwhere the signaling overhead is included in the simulation. \nSince the overhead will increase with relaying, the capacity of \n268 \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on May 12,2010 at 15:40:06 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \na system may not improve if the overhead is too high, as \nshown in [ 11 1. Therefore, the system designer can select only \nsome MO to relay. \n5)  Relaying all MS active in the overlap \nFigure 6 shows that the outage probability when relaying all \nactive MS is higher than the outage probability when relaying \nall the MOs. The performance is worse because some active \nMS which are not in  outage may use a higher overall transmit \npower with relaying than a direct link without relaying. Also \none of the MS active-MS relay or MS relay-BS links can fail \nwhich leads to this active MS to go into outage whereas it was \nnot in outage with a direct link. \n6) Relaying only MO niih SIR < SIR-ref \nThe results in Fig. 6. show that the best performance is \nobtained when all the MO are relayed. It is interesting to \nobserve that the outage probability when relaying is applied \nfor the MO with SIR below the reference SIR is less than \nwhen relaying is applied to the MO in the overlap area. Some \nMO that are close to the BS but exhibit very low SIR cannot \nachieve the target. But relaying MO with a small SIR can \nincrease the SIR of the MOs not relayed with a SIR close to \nthe target. This means the Signal-to-Interference is a better \ncriterion than distance. \nFig. 6. Different schemes to relay only some MO. (The MS \nrelay selection strategy is based on the highest SIK and the \ndistance maximum equal to I000m) \nFigure 7 shows the SIR of the MOs not relayed Without \nrelaying and with relaying only the MO with a SIRcSIR-ref. \nThe SIR target is equal to -21 dB whereas the SIR reference \nis set at -23 dB. The MOs not relayed have a SIR between \n-23dB and the SIR target -21dB. But With relaying all MO \nwith a SIR below the SIR reference (-23 a), the MO not \nrelayed increase their SIR since the interference decreases. \nThe curve with relaying shows that 60% of the MO not \nrelayed has a SIR above the target (-21dB). This shows that \nmost of the MOs establish a Iiiik with the BS without the need \nof relaying. \nFig. 7. CDF of the MOs not relayed , \nV. CONCLUSION \nThe results showed that relaying could significantly improve \nthe capacity even by using the single mode FDD for the two- \nhop relay. A new scheme to choose the most appropriate relay \nhas been proposed. This latter emphasized the importance of \nthe relay node selection strategy. Different aspects of relaying \nintegrated to cellular systems were discussed and their \nadvantages demonstrated. It was shown that a combination of \nthese proposed techniques such as applying power control \nbetween two MS, a routing seIection based on both SIR and \ndistance and finally relaying a11 the MOs can provide a \ncapacity gain up to 828.  \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the support of \nVodafone (UK) to make possible to do this research. \nREFERENCES \nETSLTR 101 146 v3.0.0 \u201c U M T S  30.06, Support forrelaying and \nODMA\u201d December 1997. \nG.
