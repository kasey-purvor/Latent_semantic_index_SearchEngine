The effect of\nthe residual stresses on the fatigue crack behaviour was modelled for both specimen geometries\nusing two approaches: a crack closure approach where the effective stress intensity factor was\ncomputed; and a residual stress approach where the effect of the residual stresses on the stress\nratio was considered. Good correlation between the experimental results and the predictions were\nfound for the effective stress intensity factor approach at a high stress intensity factor range\nwhereas the residual stress approach yielded good predictions at low and moderate stress\nintensity factor ranges . In particular, the residual stresses accelerated the fatigue crack growth\nrate in the middle tension specimen whereas they decelerated the growth rate in the compact\ntension sample, demonstrating the importance of accurately evaluating the residual stresses in\nwelded specimens which will be used to produce damage tolerance design data.\nKeywords: Damage tolerance; Fatigue crack growth behavior; Crack closure; Residual stress;\nEigenstrain\n1. INTRODUCTION\nPresent innovations in aircraft manufacture include the creation of integral structures via\nmanufacturing processes such as welding, replacing traditional riveting techniques [1] and\npermitting modular pre-fabrication of large integral sections of aircraft prior to final assembly.\nThis can potentially reduce the cost and the weight of the final product. An inherent\ninconvenience is however the residual stress field caused by the welding process, which\nsignificantly influences the fatigue life of the structure [2, 3]. The weld residual stresses must\nhence firstly be determined and their effect on fatigue crack growth rate (FCGR) accurately\nmodelled if damage tolerant structures are to be optimally designed [4].\n2In previous research [5], the changes in fatigue crack closure as the crack traversed the weld was\ndirectly measured for specimens loaded at a constant stress intensity factor range (\u0394K). The\neffective stress intensity factor range (\u0394Keff) was then computed from the acquired data. Recent\nstudies of weld residual stresses and their redistribution arising from fatigue crack growth [6, 7,\n8] have also been performed. In these later studies the stresses were directly measured using\nneutron diffraction. Good correlation between the experimental data and the prediction of the\nresidual stress re-distribtuion was found and the residual stress intensity factors (Kresid) could\nhenceforth be computed [8]. This was then used to calculate values of the effective stress\nintensity factor ratio (Reff). In the first approach the effect of the residual stresses on the fatigue\ncrack growth were predicted with a \u0394Keff approach [5] where the \u0394K when the crack is open is\ncomputed and in the latter with an Reff methodology [8] where the actual R-ratio is determined by\ntaking the residual stresses into account. In this study the two approaches are compared and the\nbenefits and shortcomings of the two methods in the prediction of the fatigue crack growth\nbehaviour in a weld residual stress field of high magnitude are discussed. The predictions in the\nprevious works [5,8] were only carried out for one constant \u0394K; here the work is extended to\nthree constant stress intensity factor ranges and results from an additional eigenstrain approach\nfor the residual stress evolution prediction are presented.\n2 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES\n2.1 Specimens\nSingle pass autogenous Variable Polarity Plasma Arc (VPPA) welding was used to manufacture\n2024 aluminium plates measuring 500 \u00d7 500 mm2. After welding, the plate was skimmed down\nto a thickness of 7 mm. The plates were welded with the weld direction parallel to the plate\nlongitudinal orientation. The middle tension (M(T)) specimens were machined with the\ndimensions and orientation shown in Figure 1. The compact tension (C(T)) samples (Figure 1)\nwere then sectioned from the M(T) specimen using electro-discharge machining (EDM).\n2.2 Fatigue loading and crack growth measurement\nSamples were subjected to Mode I fatigue loading at constant \u0394K and R-ratio (Kmax\/Kmin) of 0.1.\nFatigue crack growth rates were measured for the M(T) specimen at constant \u0394K values of 6, 11\nand 15 MPa\u221am.  The C(T) specimens were tested at \u0394K values of 11 MPa\u221am, 13 MPa\u221am and 15 \nMPa\u221am. The crack growth was measured with the potential drop method. Further details of the \nexperimental set-up can be found elsewhere [5].\n2.2 Crack closure measurements\nThe crack opening load was constantly monitored with an eddy current transducer located at the\ncrack mouth of the specimens. Further details of the experimental set-up can be found elsewhere\n[5].\n2.3 Residual stress measurements\nNeutron diffraction is an established non-destructive technique to determine stresses within\nmetallic structures [4]. The measurements were carried out on the ENGIN-X diffractometer [9],\nwhich is based at the pulsed neutron source ISIS, of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the\n3UK. ENGIN-X has two detector banks at \u00b190\u00ba to the incident beam, which allows for\nmeasurements in two directions at the same time. Details of the stress measurement experiments\nare published elsewhere [6, 7]. The gauge volume used was 2 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 2 mm3, with the longer\ndimension being oriented so as to encompass the thickness direction of the plate. Plane stress\nconditions were assumed and hence, only the components in the longitudinal and transverse\ndirections were needed to be determined for computation of the residual stresses.\nIn-situ fatigue loading was carried out using a 100 kN INSTRON servo-hydraulic test machine\nmounted on the diffractometer. The crack was propagated by applying a constant \u0394K of 6\nMPa\u221am for the M(T) specimen and 17 MPa\u221am for the C(T) specimen at an R-ratio of 0.1.\nMeasurements were taken as the crack grew from the weld centre (Figure 1) until a half crack\nlength of 25 mm was reached for the M(T) specimen and 44.5 mm for the C(T) specimen.\n2.4 Micro-structural hardness profile\nThe micro-structural hardness profile was measured across the weld and the parent material with\na Vickers indenter.\n3 MODELLING PROCEDURES\n3.1 Residual stress evolution modelling\nThe commercial code ABAQUS (standard version 6.5) was used for all the FEA (finite element\nanalysis) modelling. The plate was thin compared to the width and the gauge volume extended\nthrough the whole thickness, and plane stress conditions were therefore assumed. Plane stress, 8\nnoded elements (CPS8) with full integration were used throughout the modelling presented in\nthis paper. The smallest elements along the crack plane were 0.125 mm2. For the M(T) specimen\nonly a quarter of the sample was modelled due to the double symmetry, and half the sample was\nmodelled for the C(T) specimen. An analytical surface and contact elements were assigned along\nthe symmetry lines to avoid surface overlap.\nTwo approaches were employed to introduce the measured initial residual stresses in the FE\nmodels. In the first approach the residual stress field was introduced directly by using the SIGINI\nFORTRAN subroutine [10]. This approach for modelling the evolution of the residual stresses is\nfurther explained elsewhere [6,7].\nThe second approach used here was the eigenstrain approach [11]. Eigenstrain (\u03b5*) is a non-\nuniform inelastic strain which causes elastic strains and hence stresses. Where the residual\nstresses are known throughout the whole component, then \u03b5* can be determined from the \nfollowing relation directly:\n\uf065* \uf03d \uf02dCijkl\n\uf02d1\uf073 kl\nres (1)\nwhere C is the elastic constants tensor and \u03c3res are the measured residual stresses.\nThe stress distribution away from the notch was measured in the M(T) specimen before it was\nfatigued. This stress distribution was assumed to represent the distribution throughout the un-\ncracked specimen (i.e. assuming that the welded plate was continuously processed). In this case\nfor a continuously processed body with 2D symmetry only one eigenstrain component in the\nlongitudinal direction will contribute to the residual stresses [12] as the other components satisfy\n4the compatibility equation. The transverse stress will also be small in the un-cracked component.\nThe eigenstrain was hence computed as follows:\n\uf06511\n* (y) \uf03d \uf02d\uf07311\nres(x)\nE\n(2)\nwhere E is the Young\u2019s modulus for the material. The eigenstrain field was introduced into the\nFEA model using a pseudo anisotropic thermal strain.\nIn the first analysis step the stresses were allowed to equilibrate, simulating the residual stresses\nin the M(T) specimen.\nCrack extension was modelled by removing the boundary conditions along the symmetry line.\nThe residual stresses in the C(T) specimen were predicted from the initial stress or eigenstrain\ndistribution in the M(T) specimen, and simulating the stress re-distribution when the specimen\nwas sectioned from the M(T) sample.\nIn order to be able to compare predictions with the experiment results, the stresses were averaged\nover the measured gauge volume. The stresses averaged over the gauge volume converged\nreadily despite the stress concentration at the crack tip [6,7].\n3.2 The effective stress intensity factor range and R-ratio\nThere are two different approaches that are often used to account for residual stresses in\nprediction of their effect on fatigue crack growth rates. These are the effective stress intensity\nfactor range (\u0394Keff) method approach first introduced by Elber [13], and superposition [14]. The\nstress intensity factors in the superposition approach were computed from the FEA model using\nthe J-Integral approach [15].\nIn the effective stress intensity factor approach (\u0394Keff), the crack opening stress intensity factor\n(Kop) is measured and the SIF (stress intensity factor) range at which crack is open and can grow\n(\u0394Keff) is computed as follows:\nopappliedeff KKK \uf02d\uf03d\uf044 max\/ (3)\nSuperposition involves computation of the effect of the residual stresses on the \u2018actual\u2019 elastic\nstress intensity range at the crack tip (i.e. the residual stress intensity factor can be added to the\napplied stresses intensity factor). For the C(T) specimen, strict superposition was not valid due to\nnon-linear contact conditions between the crack faces [8]. Hence the stress intensity factor was\ncalculated at both Pmax and Pmin for this specimen. The stress intensity range (\u0394K) and stress ratio\n(R) was then computed as:\n0,, min\nmax\nmin\nminmax \uf0b3\uf03d\uf02d\uf03d\uf044 KK\nKRKKK (4)\n0,0, minmax \uf03c\uf03d\uf03d\uf044 KRKK (5)\nFurther details can be found elsewhere [5,8].\n3.3 Prediction of the fatigue crack growth rates\nIn the crack closure approach (equation 3) closure-free fatigue crack growth data (R = 0.7) was\nused to predict the effect of the residual stresses via experimental measurements of Kop (equations\n3).\n5The crack growth rate in the residual stress approach was predicted by changes in R-ratio caused\nby the varying Kresid and calculated using the residual stress (equations 4 and 5).\nThe material data necessary for the 2024-T351 alloy was obtained from the AFGROW database\n[16]. The data is available in the form of fitted constants to the NASGRO equation which\neffectively is an empirical Paris type relation in a sigmoid form:\nq\ncrit\np\nthn\nK\nK\nK\nK\nK\nR\nfC\ndN\nda\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02d\n\uf0f7\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf044\n\uf044\n\uf02d\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf044\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02d\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\nmax1\n1\n1\n1\n(7)\nwhere C, n, p, q and f are empirical material parameters, \u0394Kth is the threshold stress intensity\nfactor, Kmax is the stress intensity factor at the maximum load and Kcrit is the critical stress\nintensity factor which relates to the thickness of the specimen. More details can be found\nelsewhere [16].\n4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nThe fatigue crack growth rates (FCGR) for the M(T) specimens are given in Figure 2. It can be\nseen that the FCGR in the welded specimens were significantly higher than that in the parent\nmaterial at \u0394K of 6 and 11 MPa\u221am. However, at a \u0394K of 15 MPa\u221am the FCGR is close to the \nrate in the parent material. The fatigue crack growth rate (FCGR) curves from the C(T) specimen\ncan be seen in Figure 3. The C(T) samples were first tested at \u0394K of 11 MPa\u221am but crack arrest \noccurred as the crack approached the weld line. The load was therefore increased to \u0394K =13\nMPa\u221am and the crack grew slowly before crack arrest occurred again. The applied stress \nintensity range was then increased further to 15 MPa\u221am and the crack then grew through the \nentire specimen. It can be seen that the rate in the C(T) specimen tested at \u0394K of 15 MPa\u221am is \neven lower than the rate in the M(T) specimen tested at \u0394K of 6 MPa\u221am. \nThe crack-opening stress intensity factor (Kop) for the M(T) and C(T) specimens is shown in\nFigure 4. The result for the parent plate of 2024 tested at \u0394K=11 MPa\u221am is also shown. It can be \nseen that the crack opening stress intensity factor is constant for the M(T) specimen tested at a\n\u0394K = 6 MPa\u221am whereas it fluctuates significantly for another M(T) specimen tested at a \u0394K = 11\nMPa\u221am. It can also be seen that the Kop values are greater than that of the parent material for the\nlatter specimen. This is not consistent with the observed crack growth rates where the rate in the\nwelded sample was faster than in the parent plate (Figure 2). For the M(T) specimen tested at \u0394K\n= 15 MPa\u221am, the Kop decreased with crack length. This is reflected in the FCGR for this\nspecimen (Figure 2). For the C(T) specimen, a large crack opening stress intensity factor was\nseen. This is consistent with the low FCGR found in the specimen tested at a \u0394K = 15 MPa\u221am \nand the crack arrest that occurred for the C(T) specimens tested below this load level.\nThe measured residual stresses in the M(T) specimen, un-fatigued condition and at a crack length\nof 12 mm, are shown in Figure 5. It can be seen that the residual stresses re-distribute as a result\nof the crack growth and that the peak stresses are higher after crack growth than in the uncracked\ncondition. Measurements were also made at the minimum and maximum loads in the fatigue\ncycle for some crack lengths and these measurements showed [6] that the measured compressive\nresidual stress field in the wake of the crack for the M(T) specimen (Figure 5) was independent of\napplied load and so cannot be due to physical crack closure. Tsakalakos et al. [17] and Croft et al.\n[18] have measured the residual strain within a single overloaded C(T) specimen using energy\n6dispersive synchrotron X-ray diffraction. They also found an apparent compressive stress in the\nwake of the crack even after the specimen was completely fractured; hence again there is no\nphysical closure. Compressive macro-stresses can be ruled out as the crack plane must be a\ntraction-free surface. These authors suggested that these apparent stresses may be due to\nanisotropic plastic strains in the crack wake [18] or measurement error due to the gauge volume\ndiffering in the two measured directions [17]. Another reason for the apparent compressive\nresidual stress field is that plane stress was used in the computation of the stresses in this work.\nThis is not necessarily the case for a residual stress field, even in a relatively thin plate, and this\nmay have introduced systematic errors in the stress computation.\nThe residual stress distribution in the C(T) specimen in the un-fatigued condition and after 29\nmm of fatigue crack growth is shown in Figure 6. The initial residual stresses can be seen to be\nsignificantly smaller than that observed in the M(T) specimen. Furthermore, it can be seen that\ndue to the notch machined into this specimen the stress field is asymmetric and, in contrast to the\nM(T) results, the (compressive) residual stresses near the initial crack tip were little affected by\ncrack growth until the crack tip had grown through the initial compressive residual stress field at\nabout 10 mm from the weld centre [7].\nThe residual stress measurements do indeed reflect the fatigue crack growth behaviour in the\nsamples where a faster growth rate in generally was observed in the M(T) sample and a slower\nrate in the C(T) sample compared with the parent material.\nThe resulting residual stresses using both the SIGINI subroutine and the eigenstrain approaches\nare shown for the M(T) sample in Figure 5. There is a good correlation between the two sets of\nFE results and the measured data, which also indicates that the measured residual stresses were\nbalanced.\nThe resulting elastic strain distribution in the C(T) specimen is compared with the experimental\nresults in Figure 7. The predicted elastic strain distribution from the eigenstrain distribution in the\nM(T) specimen was in excellent agreement with the experimental results. This verifies the\nassumption of a continuously processed body.\nThe predicted residual stresses (using the initial stresses or eigenstrain distribution in the un-\ncracked M(T)) in un-fatigued and at 29 mm fatigue crack growth for the CT specimen are shown\nin 6. The predicted elastic re-distribution with crack growth was hence in reasonably good\ncorrelation with the experimental results for both specimen configurations and it can therefore be\nconcluded that to a first approximation, the evolution of weld residual stresses is principally\ngoverned by elastic re-distribution [6, 7].\nThe predicted results for the M(T) are compared with the experimental results in Figure 2a (crack\nclosure approach) and Figure 2b (residual stress approach). For the crack closure approach the\nresults were highly non-conservative for the lower stress intensity factor range, but a good\nprediction was obtained at \u0394K=15, and an excellent prediction of the rate in the parent plate\ntested at \u0394K=11 was found. There was a good correlation between the experimental results using\nthe residual stress approach for \u0394K = 6 and 11. For \u0394K = 15 the prediction was conservative, as\nthe rate in this case was not significantly accelerated compared with the parent plate.\nThe predicted rates for the C(T) specimen (Figure 3) at the lower stress intensity ranges were in\nreasonable correlation with the experimental results using the residual stress approach. Excellent\nprediction was found for the specimen tested at \u0394K = 15. A reasonable prediction was also found\nfor this case using the crack closure approach.\n7The two approaches to crack growth rate prediction are largely equivalent, as the crack growth\nrates derived using the Kres technique are those predicted by the NASGRO equation for the local\ncrack tip R-ratio. The equation constants and its form are based on experimentally-measured\ncrack growth data for parent 2024 plate at different mean stresses. In turn, these measured growth\nrates reflect the effects of crack closure and other parameters operating in those test conditions.\nThe crack closure behaviour is of course measured directly in the \u0394Keff approach and is used to\ncalculate the resultant growth rate. The Kres approach has the advantage that it will reflect the\npossible influence of R-ratio parameters influencing crack growth rates which are not associated\nwith crack closure.\n5. CONCLUDING REMARKS\n1. The initial residual stresses in a welded plate were found to re-distribute with crack growth in\nM(T) and C(T) fatigue specimens.\n2. The initial residual stress distributions in the M(T) and C(T) specimens are very different. The\nresidual stresses accelerated the fatigue crack growth rate in the M(T) specimen whereas they\ndecelerated the growth rate in the C(T) sample. Thus, fatigue crack growth rates obtained from\nlaboratory specimens, of which the exact residual stress field is not known, may be misleading. It\nis critical that such factors are taken into account when designing damage tolerant aerospace\nstructures based on laboratory specimen data.\n3. The effect of the residual stress on the R-ratio and \u0394Keff was computed for both specimen\ngeometries using the residual stress and crack closure approaches. The calculated stress intensity\nfactor range or effective stress intensity factor range was then used to predict the fatigue crack\ngrowth rate employing an empirical fatigue crack growth law. The predicted FCGR in the welded\nM(T) specimens agreed well with the tests conducted at the lower load levels using the residual\nstress approach. There was however a dip in the experimental FCGR data at about 10 mm which\nwas not predicted by the model. This might be due the micro structural changes in the transition\nbetween the HAZ and the parent material (Figure 8) which are not included in the model at this\ntime. The largest discrepancy between the experimental results and the predictions was found for\nthe M(T) specimen at lower loads using the crack closure approach. For an open crack or a very\nsmall closure the output from the eddy current transduced might give misleading results as any\nnon-linearity might be interpreted as crack opening. At the highest loads, a conservative\nprediction was obtained using the residual stress approach. This might be due to significant\nresidual stress relaxation caused by gross plastic effects at this level of load. A good prediction\nwas in this case obtained using the crack closure approach. For the C(T) specimen, both the\nexperimental results and both sets of predictions were in good agreement. To obtain better\nagreement, models that incorporate both residual stress and crack closure methods may be\nneeded.\nREFERENCES\n[1] UK DTI Aerospace innovation growth team report June 2003.\n[2] J.F.
