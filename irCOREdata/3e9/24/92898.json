Braudel\u2019s vision of a timeless dimension underlying the surface oscillations of event-based history calls to mind Freud\u2019s portrayal of the unconscious as timeless; Gurvitch\u2019s imagery of a surface of order and institutions overthrown again and again by violent, creative and irrational forces that erupt from below like volcanos (the image is Gurvitch\u2019s own) has close affinity with the Freudian economy of id, superego and ego.","cites":null},{"id":17334339,"title":"Continuit\u00e9 et discontinuit\u00e9\u2019 p.79; Bosserman Dialectical Sociology; Georges Gurvitch The Social Frameworks of Knowledge Oxford,","authors":[],"date":"1971","doi":null,"raw":"xiv Gurvitch \u2018Continuit\u00e9 et discontinuit\u00e9\u2019 p.79; Bosserman Dialectical Sociology; Georges Gurvitch The Social Frameworks of Knowledge Oxford, 1971; Braudel On History p.67.
