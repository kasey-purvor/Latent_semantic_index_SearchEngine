During last decades in\nsuch researches the information and network technologies are\nvery important. Computer processing of geophysical data\nincludes their representation in a standard form (format-\nting), statistical processing (making of statistical character-\nistics), visualization of the geophysical information (plots,\ndiagrams, maps), numerical modeling of the geophysical en-\nvironment state and geophysical processes. All these tasks\ndemand representation of the initial data in a digital form.\n[3] The requirement for digitizing of the data from vari-\nous analog medium appears from problems of mathematical\nand numerical modeling of geophysical processes. First nu-\n1Borok Geophysical Observatory of Shmidt Institute of\nPhysics of the Earth, Borok, Yaroslavl\u2019 Region, Russia\n2Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris \u2013 CNRS, Paris, France\nCopyright 2008 by the Russian Journal of Earth Sciences.\nISSN: 1681\u20131208 (online)\nmerical modeling problems demanded rather small data vol-\numes, and digitizing could be carried out manually directly\nahead of modeling. Usually the data were stored as the pa-\nper plots or tables. Afterwards data volumes increase and\nmathematical models become more complicated, leading to\nrequirement of digital data logging. Devices for reading ana-\nlog information (digitizers, scanners) and for analog signal\ndigitizing (analog to digital converters) have been created.\n[4] Thus, data digitizing began to be considered as a\npart of data processing. Now main geophysical observato-\nries record the geophysical information to digital media. So\nresearchers deal with the raw geophysical data already pre-\nsented in a digital form. There is a necessity to maintain\nlong-term storage of the digital geophysical data, to design\nuniversal data formats and to adjust formats of the different\ndata.\n[5] Today the data processing context extends, includ-\ning rejection, interpolation, filtration, decimation of the raw\ndata as well as their elementary statistical analysis, provided\nby many geophysical observatories. Thus digital registra-\ntion allows automating the raw data processing, to reduce\nits time and to obtain processing results in near real time\nmode.\n[6] The further development of digital technologies, ap-\nES3007 1 of 14\nES3007 anisimov et al.: information-measuring complex and database ES3007\nFigure 1. SAMNET magnetic stations.\npearance of personal computers and expansion of their ap-\nplication area stimulated also their usage in geophysical re-\nsearches. It concerns, first of all, to visualize the data, to\nconstruct various plots, diagrams and maps. Effective vi-\nsualization of data processing results is considered as the\nnecessary part of geophysical data processing.\n[7] The application of information technologies to the geo-\nphysical observations has resulted in occurrence of the geo-\nphysical databases, including raw geophysical data as well as\ndata processing results and providing to users various oppor-\ntunities for the data access, analysis and visualization. Cre-\nation and maintenance of these databases have undertaken\nboth geophysical services, and large geophysical observato-\nries. Their activity, in particular, has resulted in creation\nof the World Data Centers (WDCs), collected and provided\nthe data on geophysical, solar-terrestrial and environmental\nproblems (http:\/\/www.ngdc.noaa.gov\/wdc\/wdcmain.html).\nOne of them \u2013 The World Data Center on Solar-Terrestrial\nPhysics is located in Moscow (http:\/\/www.wdcb.ru\/stp\/\nindex.ru.html).\n[8] Firstly geophysical databases were distributed on dig-\nital hard media. Working with the geophysical observation\nresults has qualitatively changed with occurrence of com-\nputer networks. Internet allows not only to provide re-\nsearchers the convenient access to geophysical databases, but\nalso to create the allocated databases and the international\ndata logging networks to collect the geophysical data in near\nreal time mode. Now the regional and global geoinformation\nsystems are created to provide operative complex access to\nthe various geophysical data, collected from various sources.\nThe expert systems are developed to analyze the complex\ngeophysical information, including ones, working in near real\ntime mode. These systems are designed with usage not only\ndata, but also experiences of geophysical observatories in the\napplication of information technologies and telecommunica-\ntions to the geophysical observations.\n[9] Not only geophysical observatories but also the interna-\ntional geophysical networks provide access to the geophysical\ndata via Internet. Borok Geophysical Observatory works in\nthe Sub-Auroral Magnetometer Network (SAMNET) since\n1998 and in the International Real-time Magnetic Observa-\ntory Network (INTERMAGNET) since 2004 [Chulliat and\nAnisimov, 2007].\n[10] The SAMNET is one of the national scientific pro-\ngrams of the Great Britain, created in 1987 with the pur-\npose of the decision of problems of solar-terrestrial physics.\nSAMNET functioning is provided with Department of Com-\nmunication Systems at Lancaster University. 14 magnetic\nstations of the Great Britain, located in Faeroess, Sweden,\nNorway, Finland, Iceland and Russia, participate in the pro-\ngram (Figure 1). Geomagnetic field variations are registered\nwith sampling rate 1 s at each station. The absolute time\n2 of 14\nES3007 anisimov et al.: information-measuring complex and database ES3007\nFigure 2. INTERMAGNET magnetic observatories.\nis provided by the global position system (GPS). The data\ncollected within the framework of SAMNET program, are\nfree using in the scientific purposes.\n[11] The INTERMAGNET is the global network of obser-\nvatories, monitoring the Earth\u2019s magnetic field. The IN-\nTERMAGNET program exists to establish a global net-\nwork of cooperating digital magnetic observatories, adopting\nmodern standard specifications for measuring and record-\ning equipment, in order to facilitate data exchanges and the\nproduction of geomagnetic products in close to real time.\nIn 2007, there are 107 magnetic observatories in 38 coun-\ntries, operated in the framework of INTERMAGNET (Fig-\nure 2). The observatories and participating institutes opera-\ntively transfer the geomagnetic data to the regional geomag-\nnetic information nodes by satellite, computer and telephone\nnetworks, using standard formats of INTERMAGNET. Re-\ngional geomagnetic information nodes are the collection and\ndissemination points for real-time data within INTERMAG-\nNET. The participating observatories and institutes have\nfree access to the all collected geomagnetic data.\n[12] This paper describes the results and perspectives\nof the application of information technologies in geophys-\nical observations at the middle-latitude Borok Geophys-\nical Observatory [Anisimov and Dmitriev, 2003a, 2003b,\n2003c; Anisimov et al., 1999, 2002], (S. V. Anisimov and\nE. M. Dmitriev, 2005, http:\/\/www.scgis.ru\/russian\/cp1251\/\nh dgggms\/1-2005\/inform-1.pdf; S. V.

Borok\nGeophysical Observatory realizes all kinds of geomagnetic\nmeasurements (geomagnetic pulsations, variations of a ge-\nomagnetic field, and absolute measurements of a magnetic\nfield of the Earth). The observations of various geophysi-\ncal fields include the measurements of atmosphere electric-\nity (atmosphere electric field and current), telluric currents,\natmospheric pressure variations, meteorological parameters\nand also Doppler ionosphere sounding. The scheme of the\nmain measuring complex of the observatory is presented on\nFigure 3. The data logging, processing, storing and access\nare applied by the information technologies.\nGeophysical Observations in Borok\nGeophysical Observatory\nGeomagnetic Field Observations\n[13] One of the most advanced directions of geophysical\nresearches is observation of the Earth magnetic field. The\ngeophysical observatory can be considered like magnetic if\nthere are carried out long-term continuous observations of\ngeomagnetic field variations, regular absolute measurements,\nprocessing and analysis of raw data. Continuous digital reg-\nistration of geomagnetic field in the wide frequency range\nwith data presentation in absolute physical scales and exact\nabsolute time is carried out on modern magnetic observa-\ntories. Daily files of geomagnetic field variations, presented\nas digital amplitude-time series adjusted by the results of\nabsolute measurements, are formed. The modern level of\nmeasuring equipment, digital technologies and satellite sys-\ntems of global positioning allows making accuracy of the\nmain geomagnetic field measurement about 1 nT.\n[14] The middle-latitude Borok Geophysical Observatory\nobservations include digital registration of three components\nof geomagnetic field, absolute measurements, geomagnetic\n3 of 14\nES3007 anisimov et al.: information-measuring complex and database ES3007\nFigure 3. Main measuring complex of Borok Geophysical Observatory.\nfield variations, ultra low frequency geomagnetic pulsations.\nThe geographic location of the observatory, the geomag-\nnetic field registration received continuously within several\ndecades, a low level of electromagnetic noise result in geo-\nmagnetic data usage by Russian and foreign geophysicists.\n[15] Geomagnetic field on Borok Geophysical Observatory\nare registered within the framework of international program\nINTERMAGNET (http\/\/www.intermagnet.org). The ob-\nservatory acts in the global network of digital magnetic ob-\nservatories INTERMAGNET according to rules and stan-\ndards of global network of geomagnetic observations [St-\nLouis, 2007]. The measuring equipment includes scalar and\nvector magnetometers and devices for absolute measure-\nments, including the precision proton magnetometer and\nDeclination\/Inclination fluxgate-magnetometer.\n[16] Scalar proton magnetometer SM-90R (produced by\nGEOMAG, France) measures total magnetic field and has\nthe following basic characteristics:\n4 of 14\nES3007 anisimov et al.: information-measuring complex and database ES3007\n\u2022 sensitivity 0.05 nT;\n\u2022 dynamic range 32000\u201370000 nT;\n\u2022 frequency range 0\u20130.3 Hz;\n\u2022 resolution 0.1 nT;\n\u2022 accuracy 1 nT.\n[17] Vector three-component fluxgate-magnetometer VM-\n391 (produced by IPGP, France) measures three components\nof magnetic field and has the following basic characteristics:\n\u2022 sensitivity 0.1 nT;\n\u2022 dynamic range \u00b12500 nT;\n\u2022 frequency range of 0\u20130.1 Hz;\n\u2022 resolution 0.1 nT;\n\u2022 temperature stability 0.25 nT\/\u25e6C;\n\u2022 long-term stability 5 nT year\u22121.\n[18] Absolute measurements of a geomagnetic field are car-\nried out by portable single-axis fluxgate vector magnetome-\nter, type Mag-01H, installed on the steel-free Zeiss theodo-\nlite. Magnetometer Mag-01H (produced by Bartington In-\nstruments), provides precision measurements of the direction\nand intensity of static and slowly varying magnetic fields\nfrom 0.1 nT to 2 mT with 0.1 nT resolution.\n[19] The geomagnetic field variations are registered by the\nfluxgate-magnetometer of SAMNET network (http:\/\/www.\ndcs.lancs.ac.uk\/iono\/samnet\/). The fluxgate-magnetometer\nmeasures three components of magnetic field with 1 s sam-\npling rate and 0.1 nT resolution.\n[20] Ultralow-frequency geomagnetic field pulsations are\nregistered by the induction magnetometers, produced in\nthe Geoelectromagnetic Monitoring Laboratory of Borok\nGeophysical Observatory (http:\/\/borok.adm.yar.ru\/gemm\/\nindex.html).\n[21] The magnetometers include induction sensors with\npermalloy cores, measuring amplifiers and blocks of filters.\nThe linear frequency characteristic of magnetic sensors al-\nlows expanding a dynamic range of measurements owing to\nindemnification of spectral heterogeneity and a wide range of\nchanges of amplitudes of geomagnetic pulsations. Transfer\nfactor of the active induction sensor is about 1 V\/(nT Hz)\nwith the built-in amplifier. The basic characteristics of in-\nduction magnetometers are\n\u2022 a frequency range 0.001\u20133.0 Hz;\n\u2022 noise level 0.5 pT\/Hz1\/2 on frequency f = 1 Hz.\nTelluric and Air Electricity Measurements\n[22] Measurements of telluric currents are necessary to\nstudy the structure of ULF geomagnetic pulsations, to pro-\nduce remote diagnostics of magnetosphere plasmas, to re-\nsearch magnetosphere resonant features, to design the meth-\nods for the electromagnetic forecast of the abnormal geo-\nphysical phenomena, to develop methods of magneto-telluric\nsounding. High-sensitive, precision and noise stable equip-\nment is used to measure the telluric currents.\n[23] Variable part of the potential difference between the\nfixed points of ground surface is measured by pairs of lead\nelectrodes, located along the magnetic meridian, along the\nmagnetic parallel and vertically. Observable components of\ntelluric electric field are determined from the potential dif-\nference between the corresponding pair of the electrodes re-\nferred to the fixed distance between them.\n[24] The main difficulty of registration of telluric currents\nconsists in maintenance of the high noise stability of the\nequipment. Authentic results are guaranteed by installation\nof electrodes in region with a very small industrial electro-\nmagnetic noise level, far from power plants, the mass transit\nelectrified lines and large towns. Thus the magneto-telluric\nmeasuring complex should be installed in areas with a homo-\ngeneous geological and geoelectric structure, and also with a\nquiet relief. The territory near location of Borok Geophysical\nObservatory completely meets the specified requirements.\n[25] The lead sheets, used as electrodes for measurement of\ntelluric current horizontal components, are buried on depth\n1.0 m with distance between electrodes 300 m. Electrodes\nfor measurement of telluric current vertical component are\nlocated in the vertical hole with 400 m depth.\n[26] To suppress the in phase noise in the measuring chan-\nnel of telluric currents the symmetric circuit with a differ-\nential input is used. Technical parameters of the measuring\nequipment are\n\u2022 threshold sensitivity \u223c0.01 \u00b5V m\u22121;\n\u2022 frequency range 0.001\u20133.0 Hz.\n[27] The atmospheric electric field is measured by elec-\ntrostatic fluxmeter (field-mill), convert constant or slowly\nvarying electric field to the variable one by means of periodic\nscreening of measuring electrodes by rotated and grounded\nscreen. The field-mill, installed in the observatory measur-\ning complex, has been designed specially for long continuous\nobservations. The field-mill design provides the constant ex-\nposed area of measuring electrode and allows increasing sen-\nsitivity by the differential measurement method. The basic\ncharacteristics of field-mill are\n\u2022 dynamic range for constant electric field 80 dB;\n\u2022 noise level 0.1 V\/Hz1\/2 on frequency f = 1 Hz;\n\u2022 frequency range of 0\u20135 Hz;\n\u2022 sensitivity 1 V m\u22121.\n[28] The density of an atmosphere vertical electric current\nof is measured by means of \u201ccurrent collector\u201d. The basic\npart of installation is the ring wire antenna with 300 m di-\nameter. The effective height of the antenna is 4.5 m, the\neffective area is about 2500 m2.\n[29] The regular error of the antenna effective area cal-\nculation does not exceed other random errors of air electric\nmeasurements and makes \u223c10%. For working antennas the\ncalculation of the effective area can be adjusted by measure-\nment of real antenna capacity. Thus the dynamic and static\n5 of 14\nES3007 anisimov et al.: information-measuring complex and database ES3007\neffective areas are considered to be approximately equal, that\nis true for the advanced turbulent electrode effect, influenced\nup to the effective height of the antenna.\n[30] The vertical electric current density of an atmosphere\nis measured by the methods of voltage decreasing on the\nfixed stable resistance. The block of filters in the channel\nof an atmospheric current density measurement is similar\nto those, used in the measuring complex for registration of\nother stationary geophysical fields. The basic characteristics\nof the measuring equipment are\n\u2022 sensitivity \u223c10\u221213 A m\u22121;\n\u2022 dynamic range \u223c10\u221213\u201310\u22129 A m\u22121.\nDoppler Radio Sounding of the Ionosphere\n[31] High-frequency Doppler method for ionosphere re-\nsearches is based on observation of frequency variations of\nthe radio wave reflected from ionosphere inhomogeneities,\nchanging in time and in space. Thus changes of an iono-\nsphere state can be caused by solar geophysical factors as\nwell as by atmosphere and seismic events from natural and\nartificial origins. Propagation of the radio wave is accompa-\nnied by frequency deviation caused by changes in physical\nproperties of media and in the geometric trajectory or an\naltitude of reflection.\n[32] The high-frequency Doppler method consists in com-\nparison between the frequency of the continuous radio signal,\nreflected by the ionosphere, and the frequency of the stable\nbasic generator. Usage of the basic source enables to ap-\nply the device both for vertical and inclined sounding. The\nbasic generator frequency is shifted on some hertz from the\ntransmitter frequency to detect Doppler shift.\n[33] The equipment resolution, or its sensitivity, depends\non the frequency stability of the heterodyne receiver and car-\nrier wave of the radio transmitter. The highly stable broad-\ncasting radio station working in a short wave range is used\nas radio transmitter. The radio receiver basic generator is\nthe quartz generator with proportional thermostat system of\nthe resonator, providing the frequency stability about 10\u22128.\nSo the resolution of the measuring complex on frequencies\nabout 10 MHz is provided at 0.1 Hz level. With decreas-\ning of a radio frequency this value decreases proportionally.\nMain parameters of the measuring are\n\u2022 carrier wave frequency 4.625 MHz;\n\u2022 receiver resolution \u223c0.1 Hz.\nMeteorological Measurements\n[34] Meteorological measurements on modern observato-\nries are carried out by the digital meteorological stations.\nThe professional digital meteorological station WS-2500,\nproviding continuous measurements of air temperature and\nhumidity, wind direction and velocity, atmospheric pressure\nand precipitation, is included into the measuring complex of\nBorok Geophysical Observatory. Meteorological station WS-\n2500 consists of the base station, equipped with the power\nadapter and the cable (5 m) to communicate with the per-\nsonal computer, set of temperature and humidity sensors\n(up to 9), the wind sensor and the precipitation sensor. The\nstation is equipped with the display and to transfer the mea-\nsured parameters to the personal computer via COM-port\nin RS-232 format. Power supply of the meteorological sta-\ntion is carried out via the power adapter. Power supply of\nthe sensors is carried out from solar batteries. The obtained\ndata are transferred from sensors to base station by the radio\nchannel on frequency of 433 MHz.\n[35] The digital ultrasonic meteorological stations, using\ncontactless methods to measure wind velocity and air tem-\nperature, are applied in the atmosphere physics researches,\nincluding atmosphere dynamics. In measuring complex of\nBorok Geophysical Observatory this kind of meteorologi-\ncal stations is presented by the automatic ultrasonic com-\nplex \u201cMeteo-2\u201d, produced by Institute of Atmosphere Op-\ntics of the Russian Academy of Science. The complex mea-\nsures temperature, velocity and direction of the wind (air\nstreams), relative humidity, atmosphere pressure. The com-\nplex allows to estimate also parameters of air turbulence.\nThe raw data are transferred to the personal computer via\nthe cable as a digital code in RS-232 format.\n[36] The complex \u201cMeteo-2\u201d includes the ultrasonic mea-\nsuring block, the block of humidity and pressure sensor, the\npower unit and personal computer (operation system Win-\ndows 95\/98\/2000\/NT) with the special software. Both mea-\nsuring blocks are placed directly in the air media. They\ncan be installed on a mast for measurements in a free atmo-\nsphere. The power unit is installed near a computer.\n[37] The ultrasonic measuring block includes ultrasonic\nsystem and the electronic module to convert measured val-\nues to a digital format and to transfer them to the computer.\nThe ultrasonic system is designed as two tubular metal rings,\ninstalled vertically and orthogonal to each other, with 8 ul-\ntrasonic sensors fixed on the rings. The measurements of\nair temperature and three orthogonal component of wind\nvelocity are based on functional dependence of sound group\nvelocity from the specified meteorological parameters. The\nsoftware calculates sound wave group velocities for four di-\nrections of its propagation and then meteorological values\nare calculated.\n[38]The humidity sensor sensitive element is serial sorption-\ncapacitor element with the sensitive layer dielectric perme-\nability depending on air humidity. The atmosphere pressure\nsensor is electric strain gage, with the output voltage de-\npending on atmospheric pressure. So the ultrasonic complex\n\u201cMeteo-2\u201d allows to measure:\n\u2022 air temperature from \u201340 up to +50\u25e6C, with accuracy\n\u00b10.3\u25e6;\n\u2022 wind velocity from 0.2 up to 30 m s\u22121, with accuracy\n\u00b10.2 m s\u22121;\n\u2022 air relative humidity from 10 up to 98%, with accuracy\n\u00b15\n\u2022 atmosphere pressure from 80.0 up to 106.7 kPa, with\naccuracy \u00b10.3 kPa.\n6 of 14\nES3007 anisimov et al.: information-measuring complex and database ES3007\n[39] For continuous measurements of infrasonic variations\nof atmosphere pressure the high-sensitivity liquid microbaro-\ngraph, designed and produced by Institute of atmosphere\nphysics of the Russian Academy of Science, is used. The\nmicrobarograph basic characteristics are\n\u2022 sensitivity 16 mV\/(dyne\/cm2);\n\u2022 electronic circuit drift less than 5 mV\/\u25e6C per half\nhour.\nInformation Technologies in Borok\nGeophysical Observatory\n[40] The data logging system is the basic unit to any geo-\nphysical observations. It is an allocated computer to carry-\ning out logging and storing of the data from the sensors of\ngeophysical fields.\n[41] The modern data-acquisition equipments, as a rule,\nhave hardware and software interface of measuring devices\nwith a personal computer. The measurement data can be\ntransformed to the digital format directly in the measur-\ning device as well as in the special box of analog-to-digital\nconverter (ADC). Then measurement data come to a per-\nsonal computer already in a digital format through RS-232\nor USB ports. The measuring equipment software provides\nthe data visualization and storage to the hard disk. The\nwide spectrum of the specialized data logging systems, in-\ncluding systems designed to work in field, have applications\nin the industry as well as in scientific researches.\n[42] So, the automatic INTERMAGNET magnetic obser-\nvatory uses the specialized personal computer ENO II (man-\nufactured by IPGP) with the 1386\/40 MHz processor as the\ndata logging system. ENO II device is intended for digital\nregistration of geomagnetic data, coming from scalar and\nvector magnetometers. The sampling rate of the output data\nis 1 minute and will be increased to 1 second within the next\nyear. The synchronization with the universal time (UT) is\ncarried out by the built-in global position system (GPS).\n[43] The meteorological station WS-2500 is connected to\na personal computer via RS-232 socket. The meteorological\nstation software works under the Windows operating system\n(OS), allowing the operator to get the data from meteoro-\nlogical sensors and to display the current information. The\ncurrent meteorological data are stored on the hard disk in\nan internal digital format.\n[44] The complex \u201cMeteo-2\u201d provides the measurement\ndata to the personal computer via COM-port. Then data\nprocessing is curried out by the corresponding software. The\ndata logging software works under the OS Windows in an\nasynchronous mode, using interruptions of the COM-port\nadapter. The background mode running provides the mea-\nsurement data obtaining, processing and storing on the hard\ndisk. The measurement processes are visualized on the dis-\nplay.\n[45] However, the specialized data logging system software\nvery often is badly adapted to tasks of the continuous ob-\nservation data digitizing. These tasks assume working in\ncontinuous mode, the data storing on the replaceable media\nor the data receiving via the local access network, continu-\nous synchronization of the registration with universal time.\nBesides the data logging systems have to provide digital data\nfrom the already working analog recording equipment. The\ninexpensive built-in ADC allows easy transforming the com-\nmon personal computer to the data logging system.\n[46] The choice of ADC characteristics is caused, first of\nall, by characteristics of the analog data-acquisition equip-\nment. In particular, the number of measured parameters\ndetermines the minimum number of ADC input channels, a\ndynamic range and accuracy of measurement sensors \u2013 the\nADC word length, frequency characteristics \u2013 the sampling\nfrequency on analog inputs. If the signals with various char-\nacteristics have to be recorded on the same computer, then\nthe ADC characteristics should get out from the most sen-\nsitive sensor and widest frequency band. The requirements\nto the personal computer on which the ADC is installed,\ndepend from the ADC type. Modern ADC has the built-in\ntimer, the big input buffer to data accumulation and fast\nco-processor. So this ADC can be installed even on the or-\ndinary personal computers to use them as enough fast and\neffectively working data logging systems.\n[47] A number of specific problems appear in designing\nthe data logging system software for continuous geophysi-\ncal observations. The main task is exact synchronization\nof registered data with universal time. Usually precision\nGPS serve this purpose in the modern data logging systems.\nIn particular, the UT synchronization via GPS is used by\nthe equipments, operated in networks INTERMAGNET and\nSAMNET.\n[48] The main data logging system of measuring complex\nof Borok Geophysical Observatory, logging the data from all\nrecording analog equipment, is synchronized with universal\ntime by signals from precision quartz clocks AKV-2M. The\nquartz clocks provide a relative error \u00b13\u00b710\u22129 and an oppor-\ntunity to correct the current time by a radio signal with error\n3\u00b710\u22123 s. Because the sampling rate of the main data logging\nsystem is 10 Hz, this accuracy is quite enough. The program\nof registration uses time code signals generated by quartz\nclocks, coming to digital inputs of ADC. The durations of\npulses, following with frequency 1 Hz, (the pulse front is\ncorresponded to the beginning of the second), contains the\ninformation about the current date, hour and minute. The\nlogging software decodes the time code and exposes sets the\ncalculated current time to the computer clocks, providing\nthe synchronization of the registered data with the univer-\nsal time.\n[49] The method of interrogation of ADC input channels\ndepends on the kind of ADC synchronization. The com-\nmand on data reading can be generated by the logging pro-\ngram, then the logging program should trace the time, com-\ning from computer clocks, continuously. Sometimes it can\nresult in data loss because hardware delays. If ADC has\nthe built-in timer, the data buffer and the opportunity to\nprogramming the mode of interrogation of input channels,\nthen the command to interrogation of ADC input channels\ncan be generated by the ADC timer pulses. Because the\ndata collect in ADC buffer, the possible data loss is pre-\nvented even for enough long delays of data logging software.\n7 of 14\nES3007 anisimov et al.: information-measuring complex and database ES3007\nFigure 4. The simplified scheme of the program of data gathering.\nSo, the main data logging system of measuring complex of\nBorok Geophysical Observatory is equipped with 16-digit\nand 16-channel ADC, having the built-in data buffer, pro-\nvides the data preservation in the buffer during 1.6 s for\nsampling frequency 10 Hz. If there is a precision generator\nof time marks, a quartz clocks, for example, these marks can\nbe used as pulses triggering the interrogation of ADC input\nchannels. Such algorithm to interrogation of ADC channels\nis used in the main data logging system of measuring com-\nplex of Borok Geophysical Observatory.\n[50] Other specific task is the supporting of durable con-\ntinuous working of data logging systems with an opportunity\nof data access. Thus there is necessary to transfer the raw\ndata files from the data logging computer hard disk to an-\nother computer, making the data processing, storage and\narchiving. The raw data from the main data logging sys-\ntem are transferred to the data processing computer via the\nlocal network. If there is no opportunity to connect data\nlogging system to the processing computer via a local access\nnetwork, then the raw data is rewritten periodically on the\nreplaceable media with enough volume. So, the data logging\nsoftware of INTERMAGNET magnetic observatory writes\nthe raw data on a diskette each hour. The data transfer\nfrom the magnetic observatory to the processing computer\nis made manually by replacement of a diskette in the disk\ndrive (the diskette will be replaced by a compact flash mem-\nory stick within the next year, thus making this manipula-\ntion unnecessary). Thus data logging does not stop.\n[51] The simplified scheme of main units of the typical\ndata logging program is presented in Figure 4. In the Core\nunit the current ADC data and the virtual timer are de-\nscribed as global variables. In the Store unit the procedures\nof initialization and data recording to the media or to the\nbuffer directory, accessible via a local access network, is de-\ntermined. The ADC unit contains procedures of clock start,\nand ADC data reading initialization. In the Display unit\nprocedures of initialization and display of the current data\nplots, as well as procedure of input and processing of opera-\ntor commands, are realized. In the Main unit the data log-\nging algorithm is realized. The data logging program struc-\nture provides easy design and compilation of the program\nfor the any data logging system. It is enough to modify the\nADC unit to determine the ADC and synchronization kind,\nand Store unit to determine the data recording format. Thus\nthe program logic and the operator interface, programmed in\nDisplay unit, are kept. The data logging program is written\nin Pascal language for free distributed interplatform FreeP-\nascal compiler that allows using the same source code to\ncompile the program under DOS, Windows and Linux OS.\n[52] Each minute the data logging program writes all in-\nput data with the information about current time to the\nbuffer directory on the hard disk of the data logging com-\nputer. The storage of the minute data files on the hard disk\nprevents the data loss caused by possible failures of a local\naccess network or a diskette driver. The transfer of data files\nfrom the hard disk buffer directory to the other media or to\nthe data processing computer via the data logging network\nis carried out each hour or each day. The buffer directory\nof data logging computer is accessible for reading only to\nguarantee the raw data safety.\n[53] All data logging systems, the data processing comput-\ners and the database server, served the geophysical database,\n8 of 14\nES3007 anisimov et al.: information-measuring complex and database ES3007\nFigure 5. A local data logging network.\nare connected via the local access network. Thus the lo-\ncal data logging network, providing continuous registration\nand processing of geophysical data, is created (Figure 5).\nAll computers, included in the data logging network of\nBorok Geophysical Observatory, work under the Linux OS\n(http:\/\/www.linux.org\/), communication between them is\ncarried out by Linux software via the switchboard, function-\ning independently of the local access network and server of\nBorok Geophysical Observatory.\n[54] The Linux OS installed on the data logging network\ncomputers has the following features:\n\u2022 an open source code, allowing to modify programs for\nthe specific targets;\n\u2022 a multitasking and the built-in technology of pipeline\ndata processing especially useful for processing of the\nlarge files;\n\u2022 a lot of programs to processing and visualization of\nthe information;\n\u2022 a free distribution of Linux OS and other UNIX-like\nOS in the Internet, facilitated the supporting and con-\nsultations on the operational system.\n[55] Continuous entering of the results of regular observa-\ntions of middle-latitude geophysical fields to the geophysical\ndatabase is provided by the main data logging system col-\nlected the data from all sensors of geophysical fields. The\ndata logging system carries out the data transformation into\nthe digital format, their initial accumulation and transfer to\nthe data processing computer, logged also the data of SAM-\nNET and INTERMAGNET magnetometers.\n[56] Processing the raw data coming from the data log-\nging computers, including their formatting, averaging and\ntransformation to the physical scale, is carried out on the\ndata processing computer. Two main objectives of the pro-\ncessing are to transform the raw data to the digital format,\nconvenient for data storage and access, and to obtain the\ndata images, convenient for data viewing and analysis by\nusers. So, there are two groups of programs. Formatting pro-\ngrams translate the data received from different sources, into\nthe uniform storage format and store them in the database\ndirectories. Visualizing programs produce data plots and\nspectral-temporal diagrams, storing them as graphic files to\nallocate on the database web site.\n[57] Note, that Linux has the built-in script language Shell\nand the convenient task manager Cron, allowing to execute\nduring the set moments the data processing scripts, describ-\n9 of 14\nES3007 anisimov et al.: information-measuring complex and database ES3007\nFigure 6. Structure of the database of Borok Geophysical Observatory.\ning all necessary steps to data processing, including running\nof corresponding programs and commands. Besides it is easy\nto create \u201cpipeline\u201d of the programs, allows the data from\nthe program output without storing in file go directly to the\nother program input. Thus, small programs, each aimed\nto the certain task, are executed sequentially, consistently\ntransforming the data. Final files are created on the hard\ndisk only in the end of the \u201cpipeline\u201d of processing programs.\nBesides economy of resources, such technology allows to cre-\nate the effective scripts to process the concrete raw data,\nbased on the small programs, solving the concrete problem\nof data transformation.\n[58] The data processing computer, installed in the data\nlogging network of Borok Geophysical Observatory, executes\nspecial programs for the processing of data, coming from the\nmain data logging system, magnetic station SAMNET, auto-\nmatic magnetic observatory INTERMAGNET and the dig-\nital meteorological station. All programs have the features.\nSo, the program for the processing of main logging system\ndata controls the time code, presented in data, finds skip-\nping in the data series and fills them with the data missing\nindicator.\n[59] After the data pre-processing the programs to trans-\nform the data to the physical scales are executed. They\ntransform the hour data files, making simultaneously data\naveraging and decimation, and store the text data files in\ndatabase server directories, accessible via Internet.\n[60] The programs, providing the data visualization, read\nthe data base files, process them and create corresponding\nplots and diagrams. As the database files do not contain\ntime marks, the time is defined by the file name, describing\nthe moment of registration beginning. The sample rate is\ncalculated by the processing program trough the number of\nrecords in the hour data files.\n[61] The visualization of the data of registration of slowly\nvarying parameters, such as geomagnetic field or air electric\nfield, proceeds by the plots of their average values. This\nproblem is solved by the set of programs transmitting the\n10 of 14\nES3007 anisimov et al.: information-measuring complex and database ES3007\ndata to each other by the \u201cpipeline\u201d. The running average of\nthe plotted data is calculated before the visualization. The\nobserved data sets are processed by the plotting program,\nproducing the amplitude-temporal plots.\n[62] The visualization of the data of registration of rapidly\nvarying parameters, such as ultra low frequency geomagnetic\npulsations, proceeds by the plots of the spectral-temporal\ndiagrams. Thus the processing program gets the data sets\nand makes their transformation by the fast Fourier trans-\nform algorithm instead of the averaging. The visualizing\nprogram gets transformed data and makes the spectral-\ntemporal diagrams. All graphic data received during data\nprocessing is stored as gif files. The file names have for-\nmat YYYY MM DD HH CC.gif, where YYYY \u2013 year, MM\n\u2013 month, DD \u2013 day, HH \u2013 hour, CC \u2013 the channel number.\n[63] The database server provides access to the data via\nthe Internet by the local access network of Borok Geophys-\nical Observatory. The database web site, located on the\nserver, contains database manuals, graphic files, data files,\ninterface forms for data requests by database users.\n[64] The structure of the data storage directories of the\ndata base server is presented on Figure 6. The data files\ncontain the data from one channel, received during one hour.\nNames of hour data files have the format YYYY MM DD\nHH.CC, where YYYY is year (since 1997), MM is month\nnumber (01\u201312), DD is day of month (01\u201331), HH is hour\n(00\u201323), CC is channel number, which is the unique identifier\nfor each registered parameter. The data file contains the\nsequence of two-byte records with registered data.\n[65] The descriptions of parameters of recorded fields and\nrecording devices are stored in the data base configuration\nfiles, including phase-frequency and amplitude-frequency\ncharacteristics of input channels, dynamic ranges of the reg-\nistered fields in ADC bits, coefficients to transform the data\nto physical scales. The binary format of the data storage\n(without transformation to physical scales) has a number of\nadvantages. This is unification of the data storage format,\nthe economy of hard disk volume, prevention of loss of the\ninformation during data transformations. Thus the archiv-\ning and processing programs, making the final data files for\nFigure 7. Structure of the web site of Borok Geophysical\nObservatory database.\nthe database users, are special for each geophysical field.\n[66] The program, processing the data from the magnetic\nstation SAMNET, is executed each day, transforming the\ndata from SAMNET format to the database format. For the\ndata received from SAMNET station, the channels with 16,\n17 and 18 numbers are reserved in database. The sample\nrate in the hour files, corresponding to these channels, is\n1 s, like in SAMNET data logging system. The programs,\nprocessing meteorological data operate similarly.\n[67] Each month the collected geophysical data, stored in\nthe database, are copied on CD-ROM, acting like the basic\nmedia to archive database. Copying is made on the archiving\ncomputer, having the CD-ROM recorder.\nInternet Technologies in Borok Geophysical\nObservatory\n[68] There is most operatively and conveniently for users\nto access the data via Internet. If users deal with any\ndatabase parts, distributed on any media, then they can\nuse access and processing programs, designed for the Inter-\nnet too. Thus, the interface is unified, allowing the user to\nget data from the database web server via Internet as well\nas from the database media on the personal computer with-\nout Internet access. The free-of-charge software with open\nsources is used to provide the Internet access and to design\nthe database processing programs. So, the data processing\nprograms of Borok Geophysical Observatory database are\nwritten in Pascal and C programming languages supported\nby Linux. Programs of data requests processing are written\nin Perl 4 language using the CGI interface. All database soft-\nware was developed and distributed under the GNU General\nPublic License.\n[69] The free access data of the Borok Geophysical Ob-\nservatory database are located in the data directories of the\ndatabase server. They include the data on geomagnetic field\nvariations, ULF geomagnetic pulsations, atmospheric elec-\ntric field vertical component and meteorological data.\n[70] The visual information on all geophysical fields, acces-\nsible via Internet, is located in corresponding subdirectories\n(Magnet, Geopuls, Electric and Weather) as the gif files,\nproduced by the data processing software. The separate\nfiles contain the common information on the presented data\n(files index.html), the description of the measuring complex\nand sensors (sensors.html), database manuals (help.html),\nand also data request forms (request.html). The visual in-\nformation files (pictograms, trade marks, plots and spectral-\ntemporal diagrams) are stored in the subdirectories img. The\nscheme of the database web server is presented on Figure 7.\nAll text information has HTML format, the visual informa-\ntion is presented in gif and jpeg formats. The database\nhome page (http:\/\/geobrk.adm.yar.ru:1352\/index.html) ref-\nerences to web sites of the organizations supporting the\ndatabase. There are links to web sites of Russian Academy\nof Sciences (http:\/\/www.ras.ru), the Russian Foundation for\nBasic Research (http:\/\/www.rfbr.ru), the Schmidt Institute\nof Physics of the Earth (http:\/\/www.ifz.ru), Borok Geophys-\nical Observatory (http:\/\/wwwbrk.adm.yar.ru) and Geoelec-\n11 of 14\nES3007 anisimov et al.: information-measuring complex and database ES3007\nFigure 8. Home page and page with site map of the database web site.\ntromagnetic Monitoring Laboratory (http:\/\/wwwbrk.adm.\nyar.ru\/gemm\/index e.html).\n[71] From the home page the web-site visitor can go to\ndatabase manuals, to rules of the road and to the geophys-\nical data pages, presented the results of measurements of\ngeomagnetic variations, ULF geomagnetic pulsations, atmo-\nsphere electric field and meteorological parameters. The\nhome page and page with site map are presented on Fig-\nure 8.\n[72] All web-site pages have in the left side the menu with\nlinks to current level sub-items and logo of Borok Geophys-\nical Observatory, linking to web-site home page.\n[73] The menu items referencing to the data viewing (View\nData) specify not html files, but the program to generate\nhtml-file to view the data. On the first call (without param-\neters) the program generates the html-file which displays\nthe selected geophysical parameter of the last day or month.\nThus the graphic files generated by the data processing pro-\ngrams are used. On next calls from earlier generated files\nthe program gets as parameter the date of the data set to\nvisualize. The program creates the html files displaying the\nselected geophysical parameter for the selected date. Thus\ngeneration of html-pages to view the data is invisible for the\nuser, who goes from one date to another, using the references\nat the generated html-pages.\n[74] To provide data safety and to prevent hacker at-\ntacks the raw data files are locked. The data, requested\nby database users, are formed by the database web-site soft-\nware. The user requests the data by filling the data request\nform, special for each data type; however the algorithm to\nprocessing of the data request form is identical to all data\ntypes. Data display page and an example of the data request\nform for the geomagnetic field variations are presented on\nFigure 9. The user has to fulfill the form fields Time Interval\n(pointing year, month, day and hour), First Name (point-\ning user\u2019s name), Surname (pointing user\u2019s family name),\nE-mail (the e-mail address). After processing of the data re-\nquest the user receives via e-mail the confirmation on request\nprocessing.\n[75] The data are sent to the user by e-mail, simultane-\nously the database administrator is notified on the received\ndata request and the request information is stored in the\nspecial log-file on the database server. Thus, the control of\ndata requests with the database administrator is provided.\n[76] The database collective users get the data via the\nroutine data receiving. The sent data, their format and pe-\nriodicity of sending are established by the arrangement with\ncustomers. Also depending on requirements and opportu-\nnities of customers the data transfer can be provided via\ne-mail or via the ftp-server. So, the data of geomagnetic\nfield variations are daily transferred via e-mail to the In-\nstitut de Physique du Globe de Paris (France) and via the\nftp-protocol to the Lancaster University (Great Britain).\n[77] Because the slow Internet access to the geophysical\nobservatories, located far from large towns, the mirrors of\ndatabase site are created to improve the Internet access\nto the database. The web site of Borok Geophysical Ob-\nservatory database (http:\/\/geobrk.adm.yar.ru:1352) has the\n12 of 14\nES3007 anisimov et al.: information-measuring complex and database ES3007\nFigure 9. Data display page and an example of the data request form for the geomagnetic field variations\nfrom the database web site.\nmirror (http:\/\/geodata.borok.ru), located on the web server\nof Network Information Center of Space Research Institute\n(Moscow). The mirror is the full-function copy of the origi-\nnal web site of the database of middle-latitude Borok Geo-\nphysical Observatory, providing the graphic data, programs\nof generation of display pages, the data request forms, the\ndatabase manuals and help information. The geophysical\ndata are not transferred to the mirror. When they are re-\nquested by the visitor of the mirror, the data requests are\nsent to the database web site to process by the web-site soft-\nware.\n[78] The access to the geophysical data via Internet can be\nprovided by the International geophysical networks as well\nas by the geophysical observatories. Borok Geophysical Ob-\nservatory is the member of the Sub-Auroral Magnetometers\nNetwork (SAMNET) and the International near Real Time\nMagnetic Observatories Network (INTERMAGNET).\n[79] Originally the data on magnetic field variations, dig-\nitizing by the SAMNET data logging system, were col-\nlected on the ZIP-disk and were transferred to the main\nserver of SAMNET by the operator each week. In 2001\nmagnetic station SAMNET has been included in a local\ndata logging network that has allowed to accumulate the\nregistered data in the database server and to make daily\nautomatic data sending via e-mail to the main server of\nSAMNET. Since 2003 the observation data are sent to the\nmain server of SAMNET, located in the Lancaster Uni-\nversity (http:\/\/www.dcs.lancs.ac.uk\/iono\/samnet) via ftp-\nreport each day.\n[80] The standard automatic magnetic observatory IN-\nTERMAGNET, installed in Borok Geophysical Observatory,\nincludes vector fluxgate-magnetometer to measure three com-\nponents of the geomagnetic field, scalar proton magnetome-\nter to measure the magnetic field total value, GPS to syn-\nchronize the measurement data with universal time, power\nsupply units, the electronic equipment and the data logging\ncomputer. Geomagnetic measurements are carried out with\nthe resolution 0.1 nT. The sampling rate of scalar magne-\ntometer is 1 minute. The data from vector magnetometer\nare read each 5 s, are filtered by the Gauss smoothing fil-\nter, centered in the minute interval. The received minute\ndata of the geomagnetic field observation are collected in\nthe diskette and are transferred to the database server man-\nually each day, whence the data are automatically sent via\ne-mail to the geomagnetic information node in the Institut de\nPhysique du Globe de Paris (http:\/\/obsmag.ipgp.jussieu.fr).\nWithin the framework of INTERMAGNET program Borok\nGeophysical Observatory staff make the geomagnetic field\nabsolute measurements two times per week. The results of\nthese measurements are necessary to check and correct the\ndata coming from the automatic magnetic observatory. The\ndata of absolute measurements are weekly sent to the Insti-\ntut de Physique du Globe de Paris via e-mail.\n13 of 14\nES3007 anisimov et al.: information-measuring complex and database ES3007\nConclusion\n[81] The information technologies in Borok Geophysical\nObservatory measurement complex are considered. Features\nof information technologies related to the continuous ob-\nservations of various geophysics fields are analyzed. The\nbasic approaches to design the hardware and the software\nto all stages of geophysical data operations (data logging,\nprocessing, storage and access) are presented. Algorithms\nand methods used at the creation and maintenance of the\ndatabase of middle-latitude Borok Geophysical Observatory\nare described. The observatory successfully works in the\ninternational geomagnetic networks INTERMAGNET and\nSAMNET. The computer technologies, applied to the rou-\ntine geophysical observations, result to the database web\nserver, provided the Internet access to the geophysical data.\n[82] Acknowledgments.
