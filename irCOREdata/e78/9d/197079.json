Five substudies: survey of staff attitudes; review of case notes from high risk (respiratory) patients in medical wards; review of case notes from surgical patients; indirect evaluation of hand hygiene by measuring hospital use of handwashing materials; measurement of outcomes (adverse events, mortality among high risk patients admitted to medical wards, patients\u2019 satisfaction, mortality in intensive care, rates of hospital acquired infection). \\ud\nSetting: NHS hospitals in England. \\ud\nParticipants: Nine hospitals participating in SPI2 and nine matched control hospitals. \\ud\nIntervention: The SPI2 intervention was similar to the SPI1, with somewhat modified goals, a slightly longer intervention period, and a smaller budget per hospital. \\ud\nResults: One of the scores (organisational climate) showed a significant (P=0.009) difference in rate of change over time, which favoured the control hospitals, though the difference was only 0.07 points on a five point scale. Results of the explicit case note reviews of high risk medical patients showed that certain practices improved over time in both control and SPI2 hospitals (and none deteriorated), but there were no significant differences between control and SPI2 hospitals. Monitoring of vital signs improved across control and SPI2 sites. This temporal effect was significant for monitoring the respiratory rate at both the six hour (adjusted odds ratio 2.1, 99% confidence interval 1.0 to 4.3; P=0.010) and 12 hour (2.4, 1.1 to 5.0; P=0.002) periods after admission. There was no significant effect of SPI for any of the measures of vital signs. Use of a recommended system for scoring the severity of pneumonia improved from 1.9% (1\/52) to 21.4% (12\/56) of control and from 2.0% (1\/50) to 41.7% (25\/60) of SPI2 patients. This temporal change was significant (7.3, 1.4 to 37.7; P=0.002), but the difference in difference was not significant (2.1, 0.4 to 11.1; P=0.236). There were no notable or significant changes in the pattern of prescribing errors, either over time or between control and SPI2 hospitals. Two items of medical history taking (exercise tolerance and occupation) showed significant improvement over time, across both control and SPI2 hospitals, but no additional SPI2 effect. The holistic review showed no significant changes in error rates either over time or between control and SPI2 hospitals. The explicit case note review of perioperative care showed that adherence rates for two of the four perioperative standards targeted by SPI2 were already good at baseline, exceeding 94% for antibiotic prophylaxis and 98% for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. Intraoperative monitoring of temperature improved over time in both groups, but this was not significant (1.8, 0.4 to 7.6; P=0.279), and there were no additional effects of SPI2. A dramatic rise in consumption of soap and alcohol hand rub was similar in control and SPI2 hospitals (P=0.760 and P=0.889, respectively), as was the corresponding decrease in rates of Clostridium difficile and meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection (P=0.652 and P=0.693, respectively). Mortality rates of medical patients included in the case note reviews in control hospitals increased from 17.3% (42\/243) to 21.4% (24\/112), while in SPI2 hospitals they fell from 10.3% (24\/233) to 6.1% (7\/114) (P=0.043). Fewer than 8% of deaths were classed as avoidable; changes in proportions could not explain the divergence of overall death rates between control and SPI2 hospitals. There was no significant difference in the rate of change in mortality in intensive care. Patients\u2019 satisfaction improved in both control and SPI2 hospitals on all dimensions, but again there were no significant changes between the two groups of hospitals. \\ud\nConclusions: Many aspects of care are already good or improving across the NHS in England, suggesting considerable improvements in quality across the board. These improvements are probably due to contemporaneous policy activities relating to patient safety, including those with features similar to the SPI, and the emergence of professional consensus on some clinical processes. This phenomenon might have attenuated the incremental effect of the SPI, making it difficult to detect. Alternatively, the full impact of the SPI might be observable only in the longer term.

Five\nsubstudies: survey of staff attitudes; review of case notes\nfrom high risk (respiratory) patients in medical wards;\nreview of case notes from surgical patients; indirect\nevaluation of hand hygiene by measuring hospital use of\nhandwashing materials; measurement of outcomes\n(adverse events, mortality among high risk patients\nadmitted to medical wards, patients\u2019 satisfaction,\nmortality in intensive care, rates of hospital acquired\ninfection).\nSetting NHS hospitals in England.\nParticipants Nine hospitals participating in SPI2 and nine\nmatched control hospitals.\nIntervention TheSPI2 interventionwas similar to theSPI1,\nwith somewhat modified goals, a slightly longer\nintervention period, and a smaller budget per hospital.\nResults One of the scores (organisational climate)\nshowed a significant (P=0.009) difference in rate of\nchange over time, which favoured the control hospitals,\nthough the difference was only 0.07 points on a five point\nscale. Results of the explicit case note reviews of high risk\nmedical patients showed that certain practices improved\nover time in both control and SPI2 hospitals (and none\ndeteriorated), but there were no significant differences\nbetween control and SPI2 hospitals. Monitoring of vital\nsigns improved across control and SPI2 sites. This\ntemporal effect was significant for monitoring the\nrespiratory rate at both the six hour (adjusted odds ratio\n2.1, 99% confidence interval 1.0 to 4.3; P=0.010) and 12\nhour (2.4, 1.1 to 5.0; P=0.002) periods after admission.\nThere was no significant effect of SPI for any of the\nmeasures of vital signs. Use of a recommended system for\nscoring the severity of pneumonia improved from 1.9%\n(1\/52) to 21.4% (12\/56) of control and from 2.0% (1\/50)\nto 41.7% (25\/60) of SPI2 patients. This temporal change\nwas significant (7.3, 1.4 to 37.7; P=0.002), but the\ndifference in difference was not significant (2.1, 0.4 to\n11.1; P=0.236). There were no notable or significant\nchanges in the pattern of prescribing errors, either over\ntime or between control and SPI2 hospitals. Two items of\nmedical history taking (exercise tolerance and\noccupation) showed significant improvement over time,\nacross both control and SPI2 hospitals, but no additional\nSPI2 effect. The holistic review showed no significant\nchanges in error rates either over time or between control\nand SPI2 hospitals. The explicit case note review of\nperioperative care showed that adherence rates for two of\nthe four perioperative standards targeted by SPI2 were\nalready good at baseline, exceeding 94% for antibiotic\nprophylaxis and 98% for deep vein thrombosis\nprophylaxis. Intraoperative monitoring of temperature\nimproved over time in both groups, but this was not\nsignificant (1.8, 0.4 to 7.6; P=0.279), and there were no\nadditional effects of SPI2. A dramatic rise in consumption\nof soap and alcohol hand rub was similar in control and\nSPI2 hospitals (P=0.760 and P=0.889, respectively), as\nwas the corresponding decrease in rates of Clostridium\ndifficile and meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus\ninfection (P=0.652 and P=0.693, respectively). Mortality\nrates of medical patients included in the case note\nreviews in control hospitals increased from 17.3% (42\/\n243) to 21.4% (24\/112), while in SPI2 hospitals they fell\nfrom 10.3% (24\/233) to 6.1% (7\/114) (P=0.043). Fewer\nthan 8% of deaths were classed as avoidable; changes in\nproportions could not explain the divergence of overall\ndeath rates between control and SPI2 hospitals. There\nwas no significant difference in the rate of change in\nmortality in intensive care. Patients\u2019 satisfaction\nimproved in both control and SPI2 hospitals on all\ndimensions, but again there were no significant changes\nbetween the two groups of hospitals.\n1School of Health and Population\nSciences, University of\nBirmingham, Edgbaston, West\nMidlands B15 2TT, UK\n2Department of Health Sciences,\nUniversity of Leicester, Leicester\nLE1 7RH\n3Clinical Investigation Unit,\nUniversity Hospitals Birmingham\nNHS Foundation Trust, Queen\nElizabeth Hospital, Birmingham\nB15 2TH\n4Department of Practice and\nPolicy, School of Pharmacy,\nUniversity of London, London\nWC1N 1AX\n5School of Pharmacy, University\nof Hertfordshire, Hatfield AL10\n9AB\n6Work and Organisational\nPsychology Group, Aston\nBusiness School, Aston University,\nBirmingham B4 7ET\n7Imperial College Healthcare N\nHS Trust, St Mary\u2019s Hospital,\nLondon W2 1NY\n8Royal Orthopaedic Hospital,\nNorthfield, Birmingham B31 2AP\n945 Weston Road, Edith Weston,\nRutland LE15 8HQ\nCorrespondence to: R J Lilford\nr.j.lilford@bham.ac.uk\nCite this as: BMJ 2011;342:d199\ndoi:10.1136\/bmj.d199\nBMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com page 1 of 16\nConclusionsMany aspects of care are already good or\nimproving across the NHS in England, suggesting\nconsiderable improvements in quality across the board.\nThese improvements are probably due to\ncontemporaneous policy activities relating to patient\nsafety, including those with features similar to the SPI,\nand the emergence of professional consensus on some\nclinical processes. This phenomenon might have\nattenuated the incremental effect of the SPI, making it\ndifficult to detect. Alternatively, the full impact of the SPI\nmight be observable only in the longer term. The\nconclusion of this study could have been different if\nconcurrent controls had not been used.\nINTRODUCTION\nIn the first phase of the Health Foundation\u2019s Safer\nPatients Initiative (SPI1) four hospitals in the United\nKingdom took part in an organisational intervention\nto \u201ctransformorganisational approaches to delivering\nsafer care\u201d designed andmentored by the Institute for\nHealthcare Improvement (IHI) and implemented in\nan 18 month period from the end of 2004.1We report\nour evaluation of SPI1 in a companion paper.1 A sec-\nond phase of the intervention, known as SPI2, was\nrolled out over 20 months from March 2007 to Sep-\ntember 2008 inclusive. SPI2 included 20 UK hospi-\ntals (10 in England and 10 in the other countries of the\nUK) selected with a process similar to that used for\nSPI1. The intervention itself was modelled on that\nused for SPI1,1 with some modifications (box 1). A\nfull report including methodological and analytical\ndetail is available.2\nMETHODS\nOur methods were similar to those used for the evalua-\ntion of SPI1.2 As with SPI1, the SPI2 evaluation used a\nseries of linked substudies to address both generic fea-\ntures of systems that might be expected to improve if a\ngeneral strengthening of organisational systems in\nrelation to patient safety occurred, and specific process\noutcomes that were targeted specifically by SPI\ninterventions.\nFramework for evaluation\nTable 1 summarises the substudies; all made use of a\ncontrolled before and after design.3 While no qualita-\ntive data were collected in SPI2, all of the quantitative\nstudies undertaken in the SPI1 evaluation were repli-\ncated. Additional quantitative substudies were added\nto address SPI objectives not directly studied in our eva-\nluation of SPI1.1 These included review of surgical case\nnotes to measure compliance with a set of evidence\nbased standards for perioperative surgical care; exami-\nnation of outcome data from intensive care units to pro-\nvide evidence relevant to effectiveness of SPI2methods\nto improve adherence to evidence based guidelines for\ncritical care; assessment of consumption of soap and\nalcohol hand rub in hospital trusts, alongwithmeasures\nof rates of infection withClostridium difficile andmeticil-\nlin resistantStaphylococcus aureus (MSRA) to provide evi-\ndence on measures to reduce infections associated with\nhealthcare; and audit by two independent reviewers of\nall deaths in our case note review.\nIntervention and control sites\nTo take advantage of routinely collected data, we\nfocused on SPI2 hospitals in England only. One SPI2\nhospital declined to participate in the evaluation,\nBox 1: Differences between SPI1 and SPI2\n\u0001 The hospitals were required to work with a partner organisation (a \u201cbuddy system\u201d) and\nencouraged to hold regular meetings between the lead implementation teams (10-12\npeople) from each site\n\u0001 There was a longer period between dissemination of the preparatory materials\n(December 2006) and the first \u201ckick-off\u201d session where the various teams came\ntogether with the Institute for Healthcare Improvement to share experiences (March\n2007)\n\u0001 The financial package was smaller than in the case of SPI1; a mean of \u00a3270000\n(\u20ac314000, $430000) per site, rather than \u00a3775000 (\u20ac900000, $1.2m)\n\u0001 The adverse event target was revised from a reduction of 50% to a reduction of 30%\n\u0001 SPI2 sought a 15% reduction in mortality rates; this was not an explicit SPI1 aim\n\u0001 The routine use of \u03b2 blockers in the surgical \u201cbundle\u201d was removed as this clinical\nstandard was contentious in the UK\nTable 1 | Summary of substudies in evaluation of phase two\nof Safer Patients Initiative (SPI2)\nSubstudy and topic Data source\nUnit of\nanalysis\nStaff survey*\nStaff morale, culture, and\nopinion\nNHS national staff survey Staff\nmember\nQuality of care: acute medical care*\nIn patients aged >65 with\nacute respiratory disease\nCase note reviews (both\nexplicit and implicit)\nPatient\nQuality of care: perioperative care*\nIn patients with total hip\nreplacement and open\ncolectomy\nExplicit case note review Patient\nClinical process measures*\nUse of consumables for hand\nhygiene\nNational observation study\nof effectiveness of national\n\u201ccleanyourhands\u201d\ncampaign\nHospital\nOutcomes\nAdverse events in patients\naged >65 with acute\nrespiratory disease*\nHolistic case note review Patient\nHospital mortality in patients\naged >65 with acute\nrespiratory disease*\nCase note review Patient\nIntensive care unit mortality\u2020 Routinedata from intensive\ncare national audit and\nresearch centre\nHospital\nInfection rates associated\nwith healthcare \u2020\nRoutine data from Health\nProtection Agency\nHospital\nPatient satisfaction* NHS patient surveys Patient\u2021\n*Data collected and analysed centrally\n\u2020Data collected by hospital staff, then analysed centrally.\n\u2021In SPI1 unit of analysis was \u201chospital\u201d as, in that case, we did not have\nindividual patient data.\nRESEARCH\npage 2 of 16 BMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com\nleaving nine available for study. Ninematched control\nsites were selected with the criteria in box 2.\nTable 2 gives details of control and SPI2 hospitals.\nControl hospitals were selected and approached in\nAugust 2007, seven months after the intervention had\nstarted in SPI2 hospitals (and after it had been com-\npleted in SPI1 hospitals).\nSubstudies\nWe carried out five substudies (see table 1).\nStaff surveys\nStaff morale, attitudes, and the organisational climate\nmight be expected to change in response to SPI2. All\nnine SPI2 study sites and nine control sites were\nincluded in both the 2006 and 2008National Staff Sur-\nveys, conducted between October and December in\neach of these years. Methods were the same as those\nused for the evaluation of SPI1,1 with a sample of 850\nstaff members per site, except that a further two new\nrelevant survey questions, not available for the SPI1\nevaluation, were included.\nError rates\/quality of acute medical care\nWe sought to assess improvement in error rates and\nquality of care. We selected patients aged over 65\nwith acute respiratory disease admitted to acute medi-\ncal wards as the focus for study for the same reasons as\nin the SPI1 evaluation (high risk, error prone popula-\ntion). The areas of review included both those specifi-\ncally targeted by SPI2, such as vigilance in monitoring\nsick patients and prescription error, and those that\nmight be expected to improve if an overall shift in orga-\nnisational systems and culture related to patient safety\noccurred, such as adherence to various tenets of evi-\ndence based care. Case notes were processed and\naudited with the same procedures and criteria used\nfor the SPI1 evaluation.\nCase notes were collected over three epochs (time\nperiods). Observations before implementation of\nSPI2 were spread over two epochs (epoch 1: October\n2003 toMarch 2004; epoch 2: October 2006 toMarch\n2007). Epoch 3 (October 2008 to March 2009) was\nafter the intervention. As described for SPI1, case\nnotes were reviewed by MG, with one in 10 re-\nreviewed by BDF.\nUsing review against explicit criteria, we aimed to\nanalyse 15 sets of case notes from each control and\nSPI2 hospital per epoch (810 in total). This provided\n80% power to detect a 13 percentage point change in\nstaff compliance with a standard where baseline com-\npliance was 70%. In each month, from each epoch, we\nselected from each hospital the case notes from the first\ntwo or three patients who fulfilled the eligibility cri-\nteria. As before, case notes were not examined in ser-\nies, allowing us to detect learning\/fatigue effects\namong reviewers.\nIn addition to the criterion based explicit review, a\nspecialist in general medicine (MC) with experience in\nreviewing case notes (the principal reviewer) evaluated\neach set holistically for evidence of errors and adverse\nevents. To measure reliability, an experienced trainee\nin respiratory medicine (TN, the reliability reviewer)\nindependently re-evaluated a subset of notes (n=74).\nErrors were analysed and categorised as in our SPI1\nevaluation.1 In addition, each death was re-analysed\nby a second reviewer (MCD), medically trained in\nanaesthetics and public health (\u201cblinded\u201d to epoch\nand group), who had experience as a reviewer for the\nNational Confidential Enquiry into Perioperative\nDeaths.\nError rates\/quality of perioperative care\nImproving perioperative care was a specific goal of\nSPI2. We selected patients undergoing two types of\nmajor surgical operation (total hip replacement and\nopen colectomy) for study. We developed a set of\nBox 2: Criteria for selection of control sites\n\u0001 Only non-specialist acute hospitals in England were considered\n\u0001 Control and SPI2 hospitals should have a similar directorate structure (as described in\nthe NHS national staff survey)\n\u0001 Hospitals should have the same \u201cfoundation\u201d or \u201cnon-foundation\u201d status (to gain\nfoundation status a hospital must satisfy the government that it has the management\ncapacity to warrant greater operational autonomy)\n\u0001 Hospitals should be similarly located in either urban or rural settings\n\u0001 Once these criteria were satisfied, the hospital with the most similar size (usually\nwithin 1000 staff) to the SPI2 hospital was selected as the control hospital\nTable 2 | SPI2 and matched control hospitals in phase two of Safer Patients Initiative (SPI2)\nHospital No Beds (hospital, current) Area* Teaching status\u2020\nSPI2 hospitals\n1 411 Rural Affiliated\n2 455 Urban Nil\n3 620 Urban\/rural Nil\n4 634 Urban Nil\n5 688 Urban Teaching hospital\n6 804 Urban Teaching hospital\n7 668 Urban Teaching hospital\n8 523 Urban Teaching hospital\n9 566 Urban Affiliated\nMatched control hospitals\n1 475 Rural Nil\n2 511 Urban Nil\n3 618 Urban Teaching hospital\n4 723 Urban\/rural Nil\n5 447 Urban\/rural Affiliated\n6 789 Urban Affiliated\n7 988 Urban Affiliated\n8 532 Urban\/rural Nil\n9 1036 Urban Affiliated\n*Based on visual inspection of population density map.\n\u2020According to hospital website.\nRESEARCH\nBMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com page 3 of 16\nexplicit criteria for perioperative care (box 3) based on\nIHI \u201cbundles\u201d (collections of carefully packaged evi-\ndence based standards directed at a particular condi-\ntion or clinical scenario) and published clinical\nguidelines.4-7 Case notes were obtained from the nine\ncontrol and nine SPI2 hospitals. We used one epoch\nbefore the intervention (epoch 2, October 2006 to\nMarch 2007) for comparison with the epoch after the\nintervention (epoch 3, October 2008 to March 2009).\nWe planned to analyse 10 sets of case notes from each\nepoch (five of each type of surgical operation) to yield a\ntotal sample of 360. To control for seasonal effects, the\ncase notes were spread across each time period (two a\nmonth). The notes were processed (including anon-\nymisation) in the same way as the acute medical notes\n(see above).\nA medically trained reviewer (UN) reviewed the\ncase notes. The first 20 cases were read jointly by UN\nand RL and discussed for training purposes. The notes\nwere partially scrambled over epochs to assess, and if\nnecessary control for, learning\/fatigue effects. Agree-\nment between raters was measured by using 27 sets of\ncase notes reviewed by a second reviewer (AK), a sur-\ngical trainee. The sample was sufficient to detect a 25\npercentage point effect of SPI at 80% power given a\nbaseline rate of 50%.\nIndirect measure of hand hygiene\nImproving hand hygiene was a specific aim of SPI. A\nseparate UK initiative to improve hospital hand\nhygiene\u2014the \u201ccleanyourhands\u201d campaign8\u2014was also\nrolled out in England and Wales between December\n2004 and June 2005 and continued in subsequent\nyears. It sought to make alcohol hand rub available at\nthe bedside, as well as posters on wards updated\nmonthly, and encouraged patients to ask staff to clean\ntheir hands. We tested the hypothesis that SPI2 would\nhave an additional effect over that of \u201ccleanyour-\nhands.\u201d\nWe collected monthly data from NHS Logistics on\nconsumption of soap and alcohol hand rub (as an indir-\nect measure of compliance with hand hygiene) as an\nextension of theNationalObservational Study toEval-\nuate the \u201cCleanyourhands\u201d campaign (NOSEC).9\nData were collected on a monthly basis from July\n2004 to September 2008. This spanned a period before\nSPI (July 2004 to February 2007) and a period concur-\nrent with the intervention (March 2007 to September\n2008). To adjust for potential variations in\nconsumption because of hospital size, these data,\nwhich were available at hospital trust level, were\nexpressed as a rate (in litres) per 1000 bed occupancy\ndays. Bed occupancy days were based on yearly\naverages spanning financial years.10\nOutcomes\nAdverse events\u2014SPI2 aimed to reduce adverse events by\n30%. We identified adverse events using the holistic\nreview of acute medical case notes (see holistic review\nabove), andwe assessed the degree of preventability, as\nin the evaluation of SPI1.1\nMortality among acute respiratory patients\u2014SPI2 sought\nto reduce hospital mortality by 15%. We compared\nmortality among acute medical patients whose notes\nwere included in the explicit review from before and\nafter the intervention.\nMortality among patients in intensive care units\u2014As a\nfurther check on mortality, we assessed mortality in\nintensive care using data from the case mix\nprogramme.11 Run by the Intensive Care National\nAudit and Research Centre (ICNARC), this pro-\ngramme is a comparative audit. Data from the inten-\nsive care units in all of the study hospitals were\navailable on a monthly basis for six months before\nSPI2 (October 2006-March 2007) and for six months\nafter the intervention (October 2008-March 2009).\nData were available for the numbers of deaths and\nexpected numbers of deaths, which we then used to\ncalculate observed to expected mortality ratios. Data\nwere also available on twomean risk prediction scores:\nthe APACHE (acute physiological and chronic health\nevaluation) II score12 and the ICNARC score13 for\npatients admitted directly from a ward. We adjusted\nfor these covariates in the analysis.\nInfection control\u2014Several components of the SPI\nrelated to infection control. We assessed rates of infec-\ntion with C difficile and MRSA from data from the\nHealth Protection Agency on cases of C difficile and\ndiarrhoea associated with MRSA bacteraemia in the\nstudy sites. Data on C difficile were available on a\nthree monthly basis for the period January 2004 to\nJune 2009. MRSA data were available every three\nmonths from April 2001 to September 2009. The\ndata therefore spanned a period before the inter-\nvention (April 2001 or January 2004 to March 2007),\na period concurrent with the intervention (April 2007\nto September 2008), and a period after the intervention\n(October 2008 to June 2009 or September 2009). As\nrequired by the Health Protection Agency, the data\nwere expressed as rates per 1000 for C difficile and per\n100 000 bed occupancy days for MRSA.\nPatients\u2019 satisfaction\u2014An improvement in patients\u2019\nsatisfaction was not a specific aim of SPI but might be\na feasible outcome if an overall improvement in hospi-\ntal quality occurred. We analysed data from NHS\npatient surveys with the same methods used in the\nSPI1 evaluation. Data were collected in October to\nDecember 2006 (before the intervention) andOctober\nto December 2008 (after the intervention).\nBox 3: Standards (criteria) for explicit review of perioperative

intervention. The\ntemporal change between epochs 1 and 2was included\nas a fixed effect in the statistical models. As before, the\neffect of the SPI was identified as the discrepancy\nbetween the two armsof the study in the change experi-\nenced from the periods before and after the inter-\nvention. All patient level analyses were adjusted for\nage and sex. When the data were a time series (as\nopposed to the before and after data available in\nSPI1), we used population averaged models (fitted\nwith generalised estimating equations), incorporating\nhospital level random effects. Here cubic polynomials\nwere used tomodel temporal effects, with a third order\nautoregressive correlation structure for the residuals.\nIn this context, the effect of SPI2 was assessed as an\ninteraction between time and study arm.An exchange-\nable (rather than autoregressive) correlation structure\nwas used for the analysis of mortality data from inten-\nsive care units, as this was available only for two non-\ncontiguous six month time slots, before and after the\nintervention. All analysis was carried out in Stata v10.\nRESULTS\nStaff survey\nIn the nine SPI2 hospitals, the overall response rate in\nthe \u201cbefore\u201d survey was 53% (3957 of 7402 valid ques-\ntionnaires returned). This rate remained the same for\nthe \u201cafter\u201d survey (3940\/7448). In the nine control hos-\npitals, the response rates were 50% (3634\/7301) and\n49% (3616\/7424), respectively.\nFor only one of the 13 scores (organisational climate)\nwas there a significant (P<0.01) change over time\nbetween the control hospitals and SPI2 hospitals\n(table 3), which favoured the controls. The effect size\nfor the difference in change between the control and\nSPI2 hospitals after adjustment for covariates was\nmodest, at 0.07 points on a 5 point scale, where the\nrange between hospitals at baseline was 0.55 points.\nError rates\/quality of acute medical care\nExplicit review\nSPI2 hospitals yielded 347 sets of case notes; 355 were\nobtained fromcontrols (table 4).We found a significant\nreviewer learning\/fatigue effect (P=0.009) in the\nreview of prescribing errors, with a decreasing rate of\nerror detectionwith time of review; this was controlled\nfor in the analysis.

Baseline comparisons\nshowed no significant differences between control\nand SPI2 hospitals.\nThere was no apparent net additional effect of SPI2\nand no significant effect for any of the end points mea-\nsured (tables 5-7). For two items (exercise tolerance\nand occupation)measured in relation to history taking,\nthere was significant evidence of an improvement in\nhospitals over time. This occurred in both control\nand SPI2 hospitals. 2\nCompliance in taking observations of patients at 6\nand 12 hours after admission also improved in both\ngroups of hospitals. This was most evident for respira-\ntory rate, where practice continued to improve across\nall three epochs. There was a considerable and signifi-\ncant increase over time in use of the CURB score (a\nclinical prediction rule for predicting mortality from\ncommunity acquired pneumonia, see table 6) (odds\nratio 7.3, 99% confidence interval 1.4 to 37.7), but\nagain differences were not significant between control\nand SPI2 hospitals. Point estimates for six of the eight\nstandards formonitoring vital signs in the first 12 hours\nafter admission and for use of the CURB score\nfavoured SPI2 hospitals. There were no significant\neffects of SPI2 either over time or in favour of SPI in\nquality of prescribing (error rate ratio (estimated from\npopulation averaged negative binomialmodel) 0.9, 0.5\nto 1.5; P=0.444) (table 7). Further details, along with\ntests for homogeneity of baseline end points among\ncontrol and SPI2 hospitals and the effect of covariates\nare given in the full report. 2\nHolistic review\nA total of 725 sets of case notes were reviewed. In\nepoch 1 we reviewed 126 sets from control hospitals\nand 117 from SPI2 hospitals. The corresponding fig-\nures were 126 and 120 for epoch 2 and 114 and 122\nfor epoch 3. Agreement between the principal\nreviewer and the reliability reviewer was low (\u03ba=0.08).\nA single patient could have more than one error. In\nthe control hospitals, the average number of errors per\n100 patients decreased over the three epochs from 53\n(epoch 1), to 40 (epoch 2), to 31 (epoch 3) per 100\npatients. In the SPI2 hospitals, the average number of\nerrors per 100 patients was relatively stable over\nepochs at 36, 45, and 39 per 100 patients. Differences\nin changes in the average number of errors before and\nafter the intervention, across control and SPI2 hospi-\ntals, were not significant (rate ratio 1.47, 0.74 to 2.90).\nAs in SPI1, diagnostic errors were the most common\ntype of error.

For antibiotic prophylaxis,\ncompliance exceeded 94% in all cases; for deep vein\nthrombosis prophylaxis, compliance exceeded 98% in\nall cases. Intraoperative monitoring of temperature\nimproved over time in both groups, although this\nresult was not significant (odds ratio 1.8, 0.4 to 7.6;\nP=0.279).

Reliability between raters\nwas no better than chance (\u03ba=0.0). Over all hospitals\nand all epochs, the principal reviewer identified 22\nadverse events among the 725 sets of case notes, giving\nan average adverse event rate of 3.03 per 100 patients.\nIn the control hospitals, the average number of adverse\nevents per 100 patients decreased over the three\nepochs, from 4.8 per 100 patients in epoch 1, to 4.0\n(epoch 2), and 3.5 (epoch 3). In contrast, in the SPI2\nhospitals the average number of adverse events per\n100 patients increased from 0.9 per 10 in epoch 1 to\n5.0 per 100 in epoch 2, but decreased to zero in\nepoch 3. Again, differences in the change in numbers\nof adverse events across control and SPI2 hospitals\nwere not significant (rate ratio 1.47, 0.74 to 2.90).\nThe principal reviewer identified strong or certain\nevidence of preventability in four of the 22 adverse\nevents (that is, 0.5% of cases overall).

The principal reviewer was\n\u201cdove-like,\u201d placing all of his cases in the \u201cless than\n50%\u201d category. Table 10 gives a breakdown of deaths\nby level of preventability and reviewer. The total per-\ncentage of high (>50%) preventability deaths common\nto both reviewers was 5% (5.5% of deaths).

Based on length of stay, intensive care\nunits in control hospitals might have been dealing\nwith a different case mix to the SPI2 hospitals.\nAPACHE and ICNARC scores were similar, how-\never, and not significantly different between groups\nand over time. The rate of observed to expected mor-\ntality increased in the control hospitals and decreased\nin the SPI2 hospitals over the study period (table 11).\nThe adjusted difference in difference was not signifi-\ncant (P=0.250). 2\nInfection control: rates of C difficile and MRSA\nData on the numbers of cases of C difficile and MRSA\nwere available for all 18 trusts. The infection rate for C\ndifficile decreased over the study period in both the\ncontrol and SPI2 hospitals. The point estimate favours\nSPI2 hospitals, but differences in changes were not sig-\nnificant between control and SPI2 hospitals (P=0.652).\nFigure 3 shows the smoothed estimated rates ofC diffi-\ncile infection per 1000 bed occupied days by control\nand SPI2 hospitals.\nThe median infection rate of MRSA also decreased\nover the study period in both the control and SPI2 hos-\npitals.

All five scores improved over the\nstudy period in both the control and SPI2 hospitals;\nnone showed any significantly different changes\nbetween the two groups.\nDISCUSSION\nCommentaries on patient safety in the United States\nfive years after the publication of two key reports on\npatient safety in 2000 were characterised by some des-\npair at an apparent lack of progress.19 Our data suggest\nthat a more encouraging story on patient safety in the\nNHS can now be told.\nBaseline performance across hospitals was already\nhigh on many criteria relating to quality, leaving little\nroom for improvement. Over 90% of patients with an\nacute exacerbation of obstructive airways disease\nreceived steroids when indicated, and rates of perio-\nperative prophylaxis against venous thrombosis and\ninfection approached 100%, corroborating an earlier\nstudy.20 Where scope for improvement existed, we\nfound many examples of improved, and none of wor-\nsening, practice. Vigilance in relation to monitoring\nvital signs on acute medical wards and use of severity\nscoring, observed in our study of SPI1, continued to\nimprove. A strong upward trend in recording intra-\noperative temperature was noted. Rates of handwash-\ning seemed to have increased significantly, and the\nincidence of C difficile and MRSA infection fell.\nThough results of the staff survey showed little change\nover time, the survey of patients showed improvement\nacross all five prespecified dimensions, suggesting a\nbetter experience for patients. There was even an\nimprovement in medical history taking. Adverse\nevent rates (3.03% in our study) seemed similar to\nthose reported in the Harvard medical practice study\n(3.7%), which was based on data collected in 1984.21\nWe found low levels of preventability among adverse\nevents overall (about 20%) and amongdeaths (less than\n10%). If these findings are corroborated, they have\nimplications for future evaluations and performance\nmanagement, as the signal (preventable adverse\nevents) seems to be buried in a lot of noise (non-pre-\nventable adverse events).\nThe data we collected on SPI2 suggest that an addi-\ntional effect of SPI is difficult to detect over and above\nthe improvements occurring across the health service\ngenerally. Indeed, in a reversal of our evaluation of\nSPI1, organisational climate as measured by the staff\nsurvey favoured the controls. Adherence rates for\nmany of the specific criteria reflecting quality of care\nremained high over time in both groups of hospitals,\npossibly reflecting a long history of quality improve-\nment in areas such as perioperative care. Those areas\nthat underwent marked improvement did so to a simi-\nlar degree in both sets of hospitals. One exception was\nthe drop in mortality among acute medical cases in\nSPI2 hospitals and an unexplained rise in control hos-\npitals, such that the difference in differences would\nTable 8 | Rates of compliance with perioperative care standards before (epoch 2) and after (epoch 3) phase two of Safer\nPatients Initiative (SPI2).

Any suggestion of a difference in mortality\nrates resulting from difference in the quality of care,\nhowever, does not align well with the review of the\nquality of care observed among those same case\nnotes. The observed difference in overall mortality\ncannot be accounted for by a difference in preventable\ndeaths as only seven of the 91 deaths fell into the pos-\nsibly preventable category. Overall, though there is\nconsiderable evidence of good or improved quality\nand safety in NHS hospitals, we could not detect a net\neffect attributable to SPI2 with our study measures.\nThis largely mirrors the evaluation of SPI1,1 though\nthe latter did show an effect of SPI on the quality of\nmonitoring the respiratory rate. Table 13 summarises\nthe effects of both phases of SPI versus control, in terms\nof direction of the point estimate and degree of signifi-\ncance.\nStrengths and weaknesses of this study\nThe argument wemade in the companion article,1 and\nelsewhere,3 that studies of quality improvement inter-\nventions should followpredefinedprotocols and incor-\nporate contemporaneous controls is reinforced by our\nstudy of SPI2, where many end points improved sig-\nnificantly across both SPI2 hospitals and controls. We\nhave also shown the importance of using a difference in\ndifference approach to analysis to overcome the ambi-\nguities of single difference studies. This method is\nwidely used in economics research, where there are\npolicy and other changes occurring during the imple-\nmentation of a programme,22 and it is clearly suitable\nfor evaluations of quality improvement programmes\nin healthcare. We have also shown the need to allow\nfor learning\/fatigue effects in reviewing.\nA particular strength of our study arises from its pos-\nsibilities for triangulation. While available funding did\nnot permit us to build further qualitative studies into\nthe design, we did have various internal controls. Find-\nings on the use of handwashing materials and rates of\ntwo different types of infection support the hypothesis\nof general improvement in this area. The observation\nthat vital signs were recordedwith increasing diligence\nand that risk scoring was used more often supports the\nidea that patients at risk of deterioration were being\nmonitored more diligently. Mortality rates on acute\nmedical wards could be triangulated, not only by an\naudit of compliance with process standards, but also\nby scrutinising each death in the sample to see if it\ncould have been caused by poor care.\nWith hindsight, there are some things that we would\ndo differently in this study. We would not measure all\nprescribing errors as this is expensive, andmany errors\nare minor and of uncertain validity as surrogates for\nTable 9 | Mortality among acute medical care patients whose case notes were explicitly reviewed before (epoch 1) and after\n(epoch 3) phase 2 of Safer Patients Initiative (SPI2)\nControl hospitals SPI2 hospitals\nEpoch 1 Epoch 2 Epoch 3* Epoch 1 Epoch 2 Epoch 3*\nNo of patients 120 123 112 116 117 114\nDeaths 18 24 24 9 15 7\n% mortality (SE) 15 (3.3) 20 (3.6) 21 (3.9) 8 (2.5) 13 (3.1) 6 (2.3)\nMean (SD) age (years) 77.6 (7.7) 81.1 (7.9) 79.6 (8.0) 77.7 (7.6) 78.1 (7.1) 80.6 (7.8)\n% women 63.3 53.7 53.6 53.4 50.4 52.6\nMean No of comorbidities 2.9 3.1 2.6 2.8 3.0 2.9\n*After intervention.\nTable 10 | Preventable deaths among acute medical care cases where notes were reviewed holistically across study epochs\nbefore (epoch 1) and after (epoch 3) phase two of Safer Patients Initiative (SPI2)\nEpoch\nNo of deaths\n(cases\nreviewed)\nPreventable deaths \u226550%* Preventable deaths <50%\u2020\n1st reviewer\nonly\n2nd reviewer\nonly\nBoth\nreviewers\n1st reviewer\nonly\n2nd reviewer\nonly\nBoth\nreviewers\nControl hospital\n1 17 (126) 0 0 1 0 0 1\n2 24 (126) 0 0 1 1 0 1\n3\u2021 23 (114) 0 0 2 0 1 2\nTotal 64 (366) 0 0 4 1 1 4\nSPI2 hospitals\n1 9 (117) 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 11 (120) 0 0 1 0 0 1\n3\u2021 7 (122) 0 0 0 0 0 0\nTotal 27 (359) 0 0 1 0 0 1\n*Preventable deaths \u226550%: on balance of probabilities substandard practice led to death.\n\u2020Preventable deaths <50%: substandard practice could have led to death but probability that it did was <50%.\n\u2021After intervention.\nRESEARCH\nBMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com page 11 of 16\nserious error.23 We would instead concentrate on\nerrors whose serious nature had been established.\nThe reliability reviewer was new to case note reviews,\nand although several training sessions took place we\nwould approach this training more systematically in\nthe future. Nevertheless, previous work has also\nfound that reliability for holistic reviews is lower than\nreliability for explicit reviews.24\nWe are developing and evaluating a novel tool based\non review of case notes of patients who die in hospital,\nwhere eachdeath is scoredona sliding scale of prevent-\nability. The aim is to produce a reliable measure of the\nproportion of hospital deaths that are preventable.\nPossible improvements in clinical areas not studied\nThough we had an explicit rationale for the clinical\nareas in which we focused our study, improvements\ncould have occurred in areas that we did not study,\nsuch as ventilator acquired pneumonia and central\nline infections in intensive care units. If improvements\ndid occur in these areas, it is possible that a greater\n\u201cdose\u201d of SPI was administered in these settings (for\nexample, more activity by SPI \u201cchange agents\u201d) or\nthat such settings were more responsive to change\nthan those we studied.\nImprovements below the level of statistical detection\nThe absence of an additive SPI effect detected by our\nstudy does not exclude smaller effects that might none\nthe less be cost effective. The threshold in England\nunder which an intervention is judged cost effective is\nabout \u00a330 000 (\u20ac35 000; $48 000) per quality adjusted\nlife year (QALY). The SPI would, therefore, need to\nsave fewer than seven lives with a mean duration of\nfive healthy years (ignoring discounting) to justify the\nSPI1 investment of \u00a3775 000 per hospital (and an even\nsmaller magnitude of effect would be cost effective at\nthe smaller costs in SPI2 hospitals). An effect of this\nmagnitude cannot be excluded in a study of any feasi-\nble size; with many hundreds of deaths taking place in\neach hospital in each year the signal would be lost in\nthe noise.25 None the less, large effects postulated in\nadvance of the study have been excluded, at least in\nthe areas examined. The study was, after all, large\nenough to detect temporal improvements. The 50%\nand 30% reductions in adverse events that were aims\nof SPI1 and SPI2, respectively, were unnecessarily\nlarge in the sense that much smaller effect sizes would\njustify the costs of the intervention.\nSPI hospitals might have been less sensitive to the\nintervention\nThe studywas not randomised, andwe cannot exclude\nthe possibility that SPI hospitals as a whole were less\nsensitive to the intervention than controls. There were\nfew differences at baseline, however, and where there\nwas room for improvement among controls, similar\nroom was available for SPI hospitals. It is also possible\nthat SPI works better in some types of hospital than\nothers.26 We did not have statistical power to test for\nsuch interactions.\nPossible suboptimal specification or implementation of SPI\nSome of the reasons for the absence of an additional\ndetectable SPI effect might lie in the design and imple-\nmentation of the programme. While interviews con-\nducted with senior staff in the study of SPI11\nemphasised the \u201cbottom-up\u201d nature of the inter-\nvention, this was not necessarily how it was perceived\nby most ward staff. Despite the enthusiasm and broad\nunderstanding of the principles underlying the SPI at a\nstrategic level, the programme and organisational the-\nories of change might not have been sufficiently expli-\ncit. For example, no formal protocol for the\nintervention was published. There is evidence from\nthe qualitative work in SPI1 that the scale of the SPI\ntaskwas perceived as huge anddemandingof resource.\nThere were also suggestions that there was a need for\nthe programme to be purposefully and actively led in\neach clinical setting, rather than assuming spontaneous\n\u201cspread\u201d from one setting to another. More work\nbefore the intervention might have identified with\nmore precision how and under what conditions the\nprogramme would work best and would have more\ncompletely specified the underlying theories.\nOptimising design and execution of quality\nimprovement programmes is clearly necessary for\nmany reasons, not least to avert the risk of damaging\nthe credibility of such programmes as a whole. A com-\nbination of a more explicit programme theory and\norganisational theory of change, including better spe-\ncification of the method of vertical and horizontal\nspread, might, for example, have explicitly confronted\nthe six \u201cuniversal challenges\u201d for quality improvement\n(structural, political, cultural, educational, emotional,\nTable 11 | Intensive care outcomes in phase two of Safer Patients Initiative (SPI2).

Such an approach\nmight have encouraged an earlier recognition that the\nintervention was broad relative to resources andmight\nhave identified that effects were likely to be localised in\nresponse to \u201cdose\u201d of intervention. In that case a more\nfocused and less ambitious intervention, and some-\nwhat narrower evaluation, might have been a better\nstrategy.\nThere is also an argument that participation in SPI\ncould secure greater long term commitment to quality\nand safety in participating hospitals and that improve-\nments made in the intervention hospitals will either\nsurface at a later date or be sustained better. This\nhypothesis can be tested only with further data collec-\ntion, but it is possible that any effect of SPI might be in\nthe form of \u201cstickiness\u201d; intervention hospitals might\npotentially be better equipped to show sustained\nimprovements after the policy spotlight has moved\nelsewhere.\nContemporaneous policy and professional forces in the\ncontrol environment\nSPI coincided with a period of unprecedented increase\ninNHS funding that couldhave contributed tomanyof\nthe improvements observed. An important reason for\nthe absence of an additional effect of SPI might lie in\nthe extent of the policy level programmes and initia-\ntives that were largely contemporaneous with the SPI,\nshared some of its goals, principles, and methods, and\nacted forcefully on the control environment. For exam-\nple, the \u201ccleanyourhands\u201d campaign promoted the\nsame goal of improved hand hygiene as the SPI and\nbegan around the same time. In addition, the Health\nAct 2006 introduced new legislation on mandatory\nrequirements for prevention and control of infections\nassociated with healthcare and is likely to have exerted\nfurther pressures on hospitals.\nPerhaps most importantly, several initiatives with\nfeatures similar to IHI-style techniques and principles\nhad increasing impact on policy at around the time that\nthe SPI (which was mentored by the IHI) was\nlaunched. For example, the Department of Health\u2019s\nSaving Lives programme, beginning in June 2005\nwith a revised version in 2007,28 included a self assess-\nment tool for trusts to assess their managerial and clin-\nical performance and a set of \u201chigh impact\ninterventions\u201d that were similar to the IHI bundles\nand were aimed at several clinical processes also tar-\ngeted by the SPI. The interest in IHI-like interventions\nmight indeed have been prompted or inspired at least\nin part by the SPI; the House of Commons committee\nreport on patient safety, for example, lists the SPI\u2019s\nbeginning in 2004 as among the important policy\ndevelopments in the patient safety timeline.29 It is\nalso relevant that many of these policy initiatives had\nalready been anticipated by consensus in professional\nsocieties and medical colleges, and thus enjoyed con-\nsiderable professional legitimacy\u2014a crucial factor in\npromoting safe and effective practice.30 Patient safety\nand quality improvement was also, during the period\nwhen SPI was being implemented, drawing increasing\nattention from journals, professional meetings, and\nconferences. The SPI programme was thus being\nimplemented at a time when the momentum towards\nquality improvement was accelerating and when it\nmight itself have been one of the forces implicated in\nthe momentum.\nGiven that many of the changes in practice being\nurged at a policy level were so similar to the SPI, and\nthe resource directed at the SPI was relatively small,\nthe SPI itself might not have been a sufficient addi-\ntional \u201cdose\u201d to generate further detectable differences\nin participating hospitals: from \u00a3270 000 to \u00a3775 000\nspent over 18 months in hospitals with annual budgets\nof \u00a3150m to \u00a3300m might simply be too small. This is\nperhaps most vividly illustrated by the disappearance\nTable 12 | Patient survey scores* in control and SPI2 hospitals before (survey 1) and after (survey 2) phase two of Safer Patients Initiative (SPI2)\nControl hospitals SPI2 hospitals\nRange at\nbaseline\nEffect ofSPI2\n(99%CI)\u2020\u2021, P\nvalue\nSurvey 1 Survey 2 Abso-\nlute %\nchange\nSurvey 1 Survey 2 Abso-\nlute %\nchange\nNo of\npatients\nScore\n(SE)\nNo of\npatients\nScore\n(SE)\nNo of\npatients\nScore\n(SE)\nNo of\npatients\nScore\n(SE)\nOverall, how would you rate the\ncare you received?\n4200 82 (0.4) 3913 85 (0.3) 4 4277 80 (0.4) 3705 84 (0.3) 4 75-87 1 (\u22121 to 3),\n0.292\nOverall, did you feel you were\ntreated with respect and dignity\nwhile you were in the hospital?\n4111 78 (0.4) 3807 82 (0.4) 4 4167 76 (0.4) 3604 80 (0.4) 3 65-85 0 (\u22122 to 2),\n0.702\nHowwouldyou ratehowwell the\ndoctors and nurses worked\ntogether?\n4182 87 (0.4) 3878 88 (0.4) 1 4220 88 (0.4) 3677 89 (0.4) 1 83-91 0 (\u22122 to 2),\n0.597\nIn your opinion, how clean was\nthe hospital room or ward that\nyou were in?\n4113 75 (0.4) 3870 77 (0.4) 2 4201 77 (0.4) 3645 78 (0.4) 1 70-80 \u22121 (\u2212 to 1),\n0.141\nHow clean were the toilets and\nbathrooms that you used in\nhospital?\n4141 76 (0.4) 3877 78 (0.4) 2 4220 78 (0.4) 3665 79 (0.4) 1 70-82 \u22121 (\u22123 to 1),\n0.204\n*Mean values of five survey scores in control and SPI2 hospitals for first and second patient surveys, rated between 0-100.\n\u2020Values >1 favours SPI2.\n\u2021Values differ from simple subtraction because of rounding.\nRESEARCH\nBMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com page 13 of 16\nin SPI2 of the positive impact on measures of compli-\nance with monitoring and response to vital signs dete-\nrioration that we found in SPI1. This probably\noccurred because guidelines on recognition and\nresponse to acutely ill patients were issued by the\nNational Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence\n(NICE) in 2007,31 just as SPI2 was getting started. The\ndetectable effects of SPI could have been muted com-\npared with a situation where no similar policy changes\nwere occurring.\nIn clinical research it has long been known that out-\ncomes tend to improve over time, with the result that\nbefore and after studies systematically exaggerate\ntreatment effects compared with studies with contem-\nporaneous controls.32 In clinical research temporal\ntrends are usually the result of various factors apart\nfrom the intervention of interest, although exceptions\nexist\u2014for example, HIV drugs and prostate specific\nantigen screening diffused into widespread use before\nevaluations were complete.33 34 This risk of pre-evalua-\ntion diffusion is arguably greater in the case ofmanage-\nment interventions that are multi-faceted, not easily\ncontainable, and are promoted as part of \u201ccontinuous\nimprovement\u201d strategies. While new medicines are\ngenerally evaluated before they can be licensed and\nadopted, service interventions can more easily come\ninto general use and generate social reinforcement\nbefore a formal evaluation has been put in place.\nIndeed growing interest in the intervention might be\nthe stimulus both for increasing adoption and for the\nevaluation. The evidence provided above suggests that\nsomething like that happenedwith SPI andmight have\noccurred in the provocatively null result of theMERIT\nstudy of rapid response service on medical wards.35\nOur results suggest the occurrence of a phenomenon\nwhere the measured effect of an intervention is attenu-\nated by similar changes happening more generally.\nThis should be distinguished from the phenomenon\nof contamination, where the control group receives\n(some of) the intervention targeted at the study\ngroup.36 In the case of the SPI, \u201ccontamination\u201d is an\ninappropriate descriptor as the studywas \u201canamnestic\u201d\nand controlswere selected after the SPI had beenput in\nplace. SPI implementation was well under way when\ncontrols were selected and the controls were not\nexposed to the extensive and expensive mentoring\nprocess that SPI entailed. We propose, rather, that a\n\u201crising tide\u201d phenomenon was at work; both control\nand SPI sites were subject to the same tidal forces,\nand these same latent factors were the source of both\na change in practice and the perceived need to evaluate\nthese changes. Under these circumstances it is still\nworth evaluating an intervention, but this is more\nakin to evaluating \u201cdose\u201d in clinical research; the idea\nis pragmatic and aims to find out whether the marginal\ngains of an extra \u201cpush\u201d is worthmarginal expenditure\nor, at least, to provide some evidence to inform such a\njudgment.\nConclusions\nOur studies show encouraging signs of improvements\nin quality and safety in the NHS in England, but\ndetected only one specific improvement as a result of\nSPI, and that was confined to the first phase of the\nTable 13 | Summary of directions of effects of SPI across all quantitative evaluations of SPI1 and SPI2.
