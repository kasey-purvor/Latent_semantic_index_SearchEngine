INTRODUCTION\nThe heavy-ion fusion process has been extensively studied\nover the last decade [1], and a large amount of data has\nalready been obtained for a wide variety of systems. Even\nso, many questions in this field are not completely solved\nyet. It is well known that fusion cross section data for\nheavy-ion systems show large enhancements at sub-barrier\nenergies in comparison with theoretical predictions from the\nunidimensional barrier penetration model (BPM) [2]. In many\nworks (e.g., [3,4]), the enhancements have been explained\nfor several particular systems by considering the internal\nstructure of the participating nuclei through coupled-channel\n(CC) calculations. CC data analyses and the realization of the\nconnection between energy derivatives of the cross section and\nbarrier distributions [5] have motivated the obtainment of high\nprecision data. In recent works (see, e.g., [6\u201310]) the heavy-ion\nfusion at extreme sub-barrier energies is discussed. In some of\nthese works, it has been observed that the diffuseness values for\npotentials adjusted to reproduce fusion data are significantly\ngreater than those usually assumed for elastic scattering data\nanalyses. Therefore, the consistency of the fusion and the\nelastic scattering data analyses is a goal to be reached.\nAlthough from a theoretical point of view the CC formalism\nis appropriated to describe the heavy-ion fusion, numerical\nproblems may occur in the solution of the CC equations\nresulting in unreliable theoretical cross sections, mainly at ex-\ntreme sub-barrier energies, when a large number of channels is\nincluded in the calculations. This is an important subject since,\nfor instance, recent data analyses [11] have demonstrated the\nsensitivity to multiphonon excitations in heavy-ion fusion\nreactions. On the other hand, several attempts to improve\nthe BPM have been performed by considering permanent\nand\/or vibrational deformations of the nuclei (e.g., [12]). For\ninelastic excitations, within the frozen approximation (FA)\nthe transmission coefficient can be obtained by performing\nan average over different configurations of the system. For\nnegligible excitation energies, this procedure is equivalent to\nfull CC calculations where the complete basis of states is\nconsidered. The effect of finite excitation energy has already\nbeen studied in several works (see, e.g., [13\u201316]). In the present\npaper, we generalize the results obtained in Ref. [14] with the\naim of performing calculations of heavy-ion fusion. Within a\nmodel that we call as zero point motion (ZPM), we consider the\neffect of the couplings to the complete sets of inelastic states\nconnected to the 2+ and 3\u2212 vibrational bands of even-even\nnuclei, taking into account the effect of the excitation energy.\nDespite the large number of coupled channels, the numerical\nconvergence of our calculations is quite good.\nIn most works that deal with fusion data analyses, a few\nadjustable parameters related to the bare potential and\/or\ncoupling amplitudes have been used in order to fit the\ndata. Despite the good data description generally obtained,\nthis procedure may result in unrealistic values for the free\nparameters that could hide some particular characteristic of\nthe system. In the present paper, we analyze fusion data for\n64 different heavy-ion systems without using any adjustable\nparameter. The analyses are performed in the context of the\nZPM model and using the Sa\u02dco Paulo (SP) potential [17\u201319]\nas the bare interaction. The SP potential has been successful\nin describing the elastic scattering and peripheral reaction\n0556-2813\/2007\/75(4)\/044606(15) 044606-1 \u00a92007 The American Physical Society\nNOBRE, CHAMON, GASQUES, CARLSON, AND THOMPSON PHYSICAL REVIEW C 75, 044606 (2007)\nchannels for several systems in a wide energy region, from\nsub-barrier to intermediate energies [18,20\u201335]. Therefore,\nthe bare interaction assumed here to analyze the fusion data\nis also appropriate to describe the elastic scattering process.\nAt extreme sub-barrier energies (about 20 MeV below the\nbarrier), the BPM underestimates the data by about eleven\norders of magnitude while the results of the ZPM model agree\nwith the data within only two orders of magnitude for most\nof the systems. In this context, particular characteristics in\nthe behavior of the data for different systems can be clearly\ndetected. We show that the predictions can be significantly\nimproved by using adjustable parameters, but in this case the\nvalues obtained for these parameters may become unrealistic.\nII. ZPM MODEL AND SP POTENTIAL\nWe have considered the scattering of a particle by a\nparabolic barrier (r coordinate) whose barrier height is coupled\nto a harmonic oscillator (s coordinate). Before the scattering\nthe oscillator is in its ground-state and the particle has\nasymptotic kinetic energy E. The corresponding Schro\u00a8dinger\nequation is\n[H0 + Hosc] \u03c8(r, s) = (E + E\u2217\/2)\u03c8(r, s), (1)\nH0 = \u2212 h\u00af\n2\n2\u00b5\n\u22022\n\u2202r2\n+ V (r, s), (2)\nHosc = \u2212E\u2217\n[\n\u03c3 2\n\u22022\n\u2202s2\n\u2212 s\n2\n4\u03c3 2\n]\n. (3)\nThe excitation energy, E\u2217, and the oscillator mass, D, are\nrelated to the standard deviation of the vibration, \u03c3 , through\nD = h\u00af2\/2\u03c3 2E\u2217. The parabolic barrier is written as\nV (r, s) = VB \u2212 Fs \u2212 12\u00b5w2r2, \u2212r0 \u0001 r \u0001 r0; (4)\nV (r, s) = 0, r < \u2212 r0 or r > r0. (5)\nwith r0 defined by 12\u00b5w\n2r20 = VB . Thus, in the regions r < \u2212r0\nand r > r0 the particle is in free movement. As is evident\nin Eq. (4), we suppose that the barrier height is coupled to\nthe harmonic oscillator degree of freedom and the barrier\ncurvature, h\u00afw, is not affected by the couplings. We consider\nonly a linear coupling which is related to the term Fs in\nEq. (4).\nThe wave functions of the oscillator are\n\u03c6n(s) = 1(2\u03c0\u03c3 2)1\/4 e\n\u2212s2\/4\u03c3 2 Hn(s\/\u03c3\n\u221a\n2)\u221a\nn!2n\n, (6)\nwhereHn are the Hermite polynomials. By expanding the wave\nfunction, \u03c8(r, s) = \u2211\u03c8n(r)\u03c6n(s), one obtains the coupled\nequations that, in the region \u2212r0 \u0001 r \u0001 r0, are written as\n\u2212 h\u00af\n2\n2\u00b5\nd2\u03c8n(r)\ndr2\n+\n[\nVB \u2212 12\u00b5w\n2r2\n]\n\u03c8n(r)\n+\n\u2211\nm\u0003=n\nVnm\u03c8m(r) = [E \u2212 nE\u2217]\u03c8n(r), (7)\nwhere\nVnm = \u2212F\u03c3\n[\u221a\nn\u03b4n,m+1 +\n\u221a\nm\u03b4n,m\u22121\n]\n. (8)\nThe CC equations should be solved by considering the\nasymptotic wave functions:\n\u03c8n(r \u0002 r0) = \u03b4n,0e\u2212ik0r + bneiknr , (9)\n\u03c8n(r \u0001 \u2212r0) = ane\u2212iknr , (10)\nand the total transmission coefficient is given by\nT =\n\u2211\nn\nTn =\n\u2211\nn\nkn\nk0\n|an|2. (11)\nWithin an approximation for the asymptotic wave function,\nthe total transmission coefficient can be obtained without\nsolving the CC equations by [14]\nT =\n\u2211\nn\nWnTn, (12)\nwhere the weighting factors are\nWn = 1\nn!\n(\nF\u03c3\nE\u2217\n)2n\ne\u2212(F\u03c3\/E\n\u2217)2 , (13)\nand the partial transmission coefficients can be obtained\nthrough the Hill-Wheeler expression [36]\nTn = 11 + exp [2\u03c0 (VB \u2212 E + \u03bbn)\/h\u00afw] , (14)\nconsidering the corresponding eigenvalues\n\u03bbn = nE\u2217 \u2212 (F\u03c3 )2\/E\u2217. (15)\nThe effect of the couplings is to replace the barrier height\nVB by a set of barriers VB + \u03bbn, and the total transmission\nis given by a weighted average of the transmission for each\neffective barrier. In Ref. [14], the special case of only two\nchannel problem was also addressed. In this case, one obtains\nthe corresponding eigenvalues and weighting factors:\n\u03bb\u00b1 = 12\n[\nE\u2217 \u00b1\n\u221a\n(E\u2217)2 + 4(F\u03c3 )2\n]\n, (16)\nW\u00b1 = 2(F\u03c3 )\n2\n4(F\u03c3 )2 + (E\u2217)2 \u00b1 E\u2217\n\u221a\n(E\u2217)2 + 4(F\u03c3 )2\n. (17)\nThese results can easily be generalized for a set of different\nvibrational degrees of freedom coupled to the parabolic barrier\nin a completely independent fashion. For instance, in the\npresent paper we are going to consider the case of four degrees\nof freedom, where the total transmission coefficient can be\nobtained from\nT =\n\u2211\nn1\n\u2211\nn2\n\u2211\nn3\n\u2211\nn4\nWn1Wn2Wn3Wn4Tn, (18)\nTn = 11 + exp [2\u03c0 (VB\u2212E+\u03bbn1+\u03bbn2+\u03bbn3+\u03bbn4)\nh\u00afw\n] . (19)\nWe describe now the bare interaction, SP potential, assumed\nin our calculations. The SP potential has been successful\nin describing the elastic scattering and peripheral reaction\n044606-2\nCONSISTENT ANALYSIS OF FUSION DATA WITHOUT . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW C 75, 044606 (2007)\nchannels for several heavy-ion systems in a very wide energy\nregion [18,20\u201335]. In the present work, we use the SP\ninteraction generalized for deformed nuclei [37,38]. Within\nthis model, the nuclear interaction is connected with the folding\npotential through [19]:\nVN (R,E) = VF (R) e\u22124v2\/c2 , (20)\nwhere c is the speed of light, v is the local relative velocity\nbetween the two nuclei,\nv2(R,E) = 2\n\u00b5\n[E \u2212 VC(R) \u2212 VN (R,E)] , (21)\nandVC is the Coulomb potential. The folding potential depends\non the matter densities of the nuclei involved in the collision:\nVF (R) =\n\u222b\n\u03c11(\u0004r1) \u03c12(\u0004r2)\n\u00d7V0 \u03b4( \u0004R \u2212 \u0004r1 + \u0004r2) d \u0004r1 d \u0004r2, (22)\nwith V0 = \u2212456 MeV fm3. The use of the matter densities\nand delta function in Eq. (22) corresponds to the zero-range\napproach for the folding potential, which is equivalent to the\nmore usual procedure of using an effective nucleon-nucleon\ninteraction with the nucleon densities of the nuclei (instead of\nthe matter densities). In order to illustrate this point, which is\nextensively discussed in Refs. [19,37], in Fig. 1 we show the\nundeformed SP potential calculated through the zero (dashed\nlines) and finite (solid lines) range approaches for four systems\nat energies E = VB0. The difference between solid and dashed\nlines is almost indistinguishable in the figure indicating that\nthe two approaches are in fact equivalent. However, due to\nthe six-dimensional integral, the finite-range approach takes\nmuch more computational time in the numerical calculation\nof deformed potentials than the zero-range one [37]. Thus,\nin the present work we have assumed the zero-range in our\ntheoretical calculations of fusion cross sections.\nHereafter, we assume a two-parameter Fermi (2pF) dis-\ntribution to describe the deformed density of a given\nnucleus i\n\u03c1i(\u0004r) = \u03c10i1 + exp ( r\u2212Ri\na\n) , (23)\nRi = R0i\n[\n1 +\n\u2211\n\u03bb\n\u03b2\u03bbi Y\u03bb0(\n\u03bbi)\n]\n, (24)\nwhere \n\u03bbi is the angle between \u0004r and the symmetry axis of the\n\u03bb deformation. We limit the present study to \u03bb = 2 and 3.\nIn an earlier paper [19], we presented an extensive system-\natics for the densities of heavy nuclei. We found that the radii\nof the matter (R0M ) and charge (R0C) densities can be well\nrepresented by\nR0M = 1.31A1\/3 \u2212 0.84 fm, (25)\nR0C = 1.76Z1\/3 \u2212 0.96 fm. (26)\nThe charge and matter distributions present average diffuse-\nness values of a = 0.53 fm and a = 0.56 fm, respectively.\nThe quadrupole and octupole deformation parameters can be\nobtained based on the corresponding experimental results for\nthe transition probabilities:\nB(E\u03bb) =\n(\n3 Ze \u03b2\u03bb R\u03bb0C\n4\u03c0\n)2\n. (27)\nThe frequencies of the \u03bb = 2 and 3 modes are connected\nwith the excitation energies of the corresponding 2+1 and 3\n\u2212\n1\nstates. In the context of the systematics for the densities, the SP\npotential has no adjustable parameter. Therefore, the results of\nthe present work for theoretical fusion cross sections represent\npredictions rather than data fits. This is an important feature\nof our model.\nIn the context of the BPM, the effective potential is a sum\nof the Coulomb, nuclear and centrifugal parts:\nVeff(R) = VC(R) + VN (R) + \u000b(\u000b + 1)h\u00af\n2\n2\u00b5R2\n.

(29)\nIn our calculations, the sum in Eq. (29) is performed up to a\nmaximum partial wave \u000bmax, which is the greatest \u000b value that\nresults a pocket (and a barrier) in the corresponding effective\npotential. For \u000b-waves with effective barrier heights (VB\u000b)\nbelow the center of mass energy, we have approximated the\neffective potential by a parabola with curvature:\nh\u00af\u03c9\u000b =\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223h\u00af2\u00b5 d\n2Veff\ndR2\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n1\/2\nRB\u000b\n, (30)\nwhere RB\u000b is the barrier radius. On the other hand, for \u000b-waves\nwith VB\u000b \u0005 E, the approximation of the effective potential\nby a parabolic barrier is not appropriate due to the tail of\nthe Coulomb potential, and the calculation of transmission\ncoefficients through the Hill-Wheeler expression using the\ncurvature provided by Eq. (30) is not accurate anymore. Thus,\nin this regime, we define h\u00afw by another form. For \u000b-waves\nwith VB\u000b > E we have adopted the more appropriated WKB\nmethod:\nT\u000b = [1 + exp(S\u000b)]\u22121, (31)\nS\u000b =\n\u222b R2\nR1\n\u221a\n8\u00b5\nh\u00af2\n[Veff(R) \u2212 E] dR, (32)\nwhere R1 and R2 are the classical turning points. In this case,\nwe obtain the barrier curvature that, within the context of\nthe Hill-Wheeler expression, would provide the same value\nfor the transmission coefficient as obtained with the WKB\ncalculations for the undeformed effective potential:\nh\u00afw\u000b = 2\u03c0 (VB\u000b \u2212 E)\nS\u000b\n. (33)\nThen, we use this value in Eq. (19) which contains the effect of\nthe couplings. With this method, we assume that even for E \u0006\nVB\u000b the effective potential can be described by a parabolic\nbarrier.\nFigure 2 shows a schematic representation of the collision\nof two deformed nuclei, where \u03b8 would represent the direction\nof the symmetry axis of the nucleus and \u0004R connects the center\nof mass of both nuclei. Due to the short range of the nuclear\ninteraction, the barrier height depends practically only on the\nR\nz\n2\u03b81\n\u03b8\nx\n1s\nFIG. 2. Schematic representation of the collision between two\ndeformed nuclei. The s coordinate represents the variation of the\nnuclear radius relative to the spherical shape in the direction of \u0004R.\ncoordinate s represented in this same figure. Different sets of\n\u03b8 and \u03b2 values that result in the same s value also provide\nvery similar VB\u000b values. Thus, we have obtained coupling\namplitudes by considering the derivative of the barrier height\nrelative to the s coordinate:\nF\u03bbi(\u000b) = \u2212\u2202VB\u000b\n\u2202s\u03bbi\n, (34)\nwhere i could represent nucleus 1 or 2. Within the vibrational\nmodel, the standard deviation of the s coordinate is connected\nwith the \u03b2 value through\n\u03c3\u03bbi = \u03b2\u03bbiR0i\u221a\n4\u03c0\n. (35)\nIn this context, the collision of two deformed nuclei in-\nvolves four vibrational coordinates (s\u03bbi) corresponding to the\nquadrupole and octupole modes of both nuclei. As a further\napproximation, we have assumed that the F\u03bbi are independent\nparameters and the partial derivative involved in Eq. (34) has\nbeen calculated with respect to a spherical shape.\nThe Coulomb and nuclear deformation parameters may not\nhave the same value, because they are related to different\n(charge and matter) distributions. However, to avoid the use\nof adjustable parameters, we have assumed the same value for\nboth deformations. This procedure is in fact quite reasonable\nbecause the nuclear and Coulomb deformations are expected to\nhave similar values. The \u03b22 and \u03b23 values were obtained from\nEq. (27), through transition amplitudes from the systematics\nfor even-even nuclei presented in Refs. [39,40].\nIn the context presented here, the ZPM model describes, in\nan approximate form, the couplings of excited states related\nto complete bands of quadrupole and octupole modes of\nvibration, corresponding to a large number of couplings to\ninelastic states. However, no couplings to transfer channels\nare included in our calculations. Some of the nuclei involved\nin this work could be better represented by the rotational\nmodel rather than the vibrational one. On the other hand, the\nstandard deviation \u03c3\u03bb of rotational distributions is related to\nthe corresponding \u03b2\u03bb value through the same expression that\nis valid for vibrational distributions, Eq. (35).

The\nenergy scale is represented relative to the undeformed s-wave\nbarrier height (VB0). With exception of Figs. 3, 14 and 21,\nthe figures have the same scale of energy and cross section.\nThis procedure makes simple the comparison among results\nof different systems.\nIn Fig. 3 we present the lightest systems studied in the\npresent work. In the case of 12C + 12C, the BPM and ZPM\nresults are almost indistinguishable and agree quite well with\nthe data in the entire energy region corresponding to about nine\norders of magnitude in cross sections. For 16O + 16O, the ZPM\ncross sections are slightly larger than the BPM predictions\nand appropriately approach the data at sub-barrier energies.\nDespite the large \u03b2 values of the 12C and 16O nuclei (see\nTable I), the ZPM and BPM predictions are very similar and\nalmost no effect of the couplings is observed. This is because\nthe coupling strength F for light systems is small and the\nexcitation energies for these nuclei are large. To illustrate this\npoint, the dotted lines in Fig. 3 represent the results of the FA,\ni.e., those obtained considering E\u2217 = 0. By comparing the\nsolid and dotted lines, one can notice the significant effect of\nthe excitation energy.\nFigure 4 presents fusion data for the 12C + 92Zr and 12C,\n18O, 32S + 208Pb systems. Large enhancements of the data\nrelative to the BPM cross sections can be observed, and the\nZPM results are in much better agreement with the data.\nThe heavier systems present larger enhancements than the\nlighter ones, as was already reported many years ago [2].\nThis behavior is due to the increasing values of couplings\nstrengths (F ) for heavier systems. However, this in fact is not a\ngeneral behavior of the heavy-ion fusion, and a few exceptions\ncan be found. For instance, in Fig. 5 the enhancement for\n16O + 208Pb is in fact slightly smaller than those for the lighter\n16O + 182,186W systems. On the other hand, the ZPM cross\nsections are in good agreement with the data (see Fig. 5).\nThis behavior is related to the larger \u03b22 (and smaller E\u22172 )\n044606-5\nNOBRE, CHAMON, GASQUES, CARLSON, AND THOMPSON PHYSICAL REVIEW C 75, 044606 (2007)\n10-3\n10-1\n101\n103\n\u03c3\nF\n(m\nb)\n18O + 208Pb\nVB0= 75.0 MeV\n-15 -10 -5 0 5 1010\n-5\n10-3\n10-1\n101\n103\n12C + 208Pb\nVB0= 57.8 MeV\n12C + 92Zr\nVB0= 32.2 MeV\n\u03c3\nF\n(m\nb)\n(EC.M.-VB0) (MeV)\n-15 -10 -5 0 5 10 15\n32S + 208Pb\nVB0= 146.3 MeV\n(EC.M.-VB0) (MeV)\nFIG. 4.

Despite the\nsimilar region of mass, significant differences in the magnitude\nof the enhancements (relative to BPM) are observed indicating\nstrong effects of the structure of the target nuclei. These\nsystems were analyzed in Ref. [12], where for the first\ntime the zero point motion of the nuclear surface was\napplied in the study of heavy-ion fusion. In that work, the\neffect of the excitation energy was not considered and an\nadjustable parameter related to the bare potential was used\nto fit the data. Clearly, the present ZPM results also account\nfor these effects of structure due to the very different \u03b22\nand E\u22172 values of the samarium isotopes (see Table I).

In fact, for all systems presented earlier (Figs. 3\u201314),\nthe ZPM and also the BPM predictions agree very well with\nthe data for above barrier energies, but for 84Kr + 92Mo this\nbehavior is not observed. For 84Kr + 104Ru the fusion-fission\nprocess could be important also at sub-barrier energies (see\nFig. 15). For symmetric systems, this effect is even more\nemphasized, as can be observed in Fig. 16 for 90Zr + 90,96Zr.\nIn Figs. 17 and 18 other heavy systems are presented.\nThe corresponding ZPM cross sections represent well the\nbehavior of the data, except for 64Ni + 100Mo and 58Ni + 112Sn\n(Fig. 18).

Partial fusion cross sections\nat four energies as obtained from CC\ncalculations for the 64Ni + 64Ni system.\nmeans that, at low energies when the reaction and outgoing\ncross sections are nearly equal, the fusion is a small difference\nof large numbers and hence cannot be calculated accurately. To\nillustrate this point, in Fig. 22 we show the partial contribution\nof each \u000b-wave to the total CC fusion cross section in different\nenergies. For E = 89 MeV, the behavior of the partial fusion\ncross section becomes oscillatory for \u000b \u0002 18, including some\nnegative values for particular \u000b values, which is an indication\nthat numerical problems have occurred. Even so, for this\nenergy a reliable value for the total fusion can be obtained if\none consider the integration of partial waves only up to \u000b = 18.\nFor the lowest energy of Fig. 22, E = 87 MeV, the oscillations\nare much larger, with several negative values for the partial\ncross section, and there is no form to determine a reliable total\nfusion cross section. There are other ways to solve the CC\nequations, such as using R-matrix expansions, and also other\nway to obtain fusion cross section, through the integral of the\nsquare of the multichannel wave function with the imaginary\npotentials (both diagonal and nondiagonal), which might avoid\nthis problem. An advantage of the present model is the absence\nof numerical problems in such conditions. In fact, the ZPM\ncalculations could be performed down to very low energies (see\nFig. 21). On the other hand, the ZPM model assumes an infinite\nbasis of excited states of harmonic vibrations, and clearly\nthis is only an approximation (and therefore a limitation)\nfor the complicate problem of the collision between two\nnuclei.\nWe also have calculated cross sections considering cou-\nplings only to the 2+ and 3\u2212 states, but in another approach\nwithin the present context by assuming Eqs. (16) and (17).\nClearly these results are very similar to those obtained with\nthe FRESCO code (see Fig. 21). In the same figure, one can\nobserve the difference between the procedures of coupling\nonly the 2+ and 3\u2212 states in comparison with the couplings to\nthe complete bands that correspond to these states. The\ndifference would be much more significant if the excitation\nenergies were smaller, because in this case several states would\ncontribute significantly to the fusion process.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nIn Fig. 23, we present a summary of the results presented\nin this paper, by calculating the ratio between fusion data and\ncorresponding BPM or ZPM cross sections. The exceptions\nare the 84Kr + 104Ru and 90Zr + 90,96Zr systems for which\nthe data do not correspond to the total fusion even at sub-\nbarrier energies. At extreme sub-barrier energies, the data are\nunderestimated by the BPM calculations by eleven orders of\nmagnitude (see Fig. 23). On the other hand, almost all ZPM\ncross sections agree with the data within only two orders of\nmagnitude (see Fig. 23). Therefore, it is reasonable to state\nthat the couplings to inelastic excited states are responsible by\nthe major part of the enhancements of the data relative to the\nBPM. Besides the data set presented in this paper, we have\nalso analyzed data from about another 30 different systems.\nThe corresponding results are very similar to those presented\nhere, i.e.. the ZPM model predictions agree with most of the\ndata within two orders of magnitude.\n-20 -15 -10 -5 0 5\n10-4\n10-2\n100\n102\n104\n106\n108\n1010\n1012\n\u03c3F\/\u03c3BPM\n \n(EC.M.-VB0) (MeV)\n-20 -15 -10 -5 0 5\n10-4\n10-2\n100\n102\n104\n106\n108\n1010\n1012\n\u03c3F\/\u03c3ZPM\n \n(EC.M.-VB0) (MeV)\nFIG. 23.

Fusion cross section data (from Refs. [72,82]) for the\n40Ca, 40Ar + 116Sn systems. The solid and dashed lines correspond\nto BPM and (standard) ZPM results, respectively. The other lines\ncorrespond to ZPM calculations, where the \u03b2 values or the diffuseness\nof the densities were modified (see text for details).\nAs commented in Sec. II, although some nuclei involved\nin our analyses are better represented by the rotational model,\nwe have assumed the ZPM to calculate fusion cross sections.\nEven so, similar agreement concerning data and theoretical\npredictions were obtained for all systems. For instance, the\n144Sm is considered a vibrator while the 154Sm should be\nbetter represented as a rotor. Even so, the results obtained for\n16O, 40Ar + 154Sm (Figs. 6 and 13) are as good as those for\n16O, 28Si, 40Ar + 144Sm (Figs. 6, 7, and 14). Further examples\nare the 238U (rotational) and 58,64Ni (vibrational) nuclei, for\nwhich the corresponding results obtained for 16O + 238U\n(Fig. 19) and 58,64Ni + 58,64Ni (Figs. 17 and 21) are very\nsimilar. In this sense, the ZPM model seems to be appropriated\nto describe the fusion also for systems involving rotational\nnuclei. As already commented, probably this feature is due\nto the fact that Eq. (35) provides the exact result for standard\ndeviations of both vibrational and rotational models.\nIn Fig. 24, we present fusion data for the 40Ca, 40Ar + 116Sn\nsystems. The BPM and ZPM results correspond to the dashed\nand solid lines in the figure, respectively. While for the 40Ar\nprojectile the ZPM cross sections are in quite good agreement\nwith the data, for 40Ca the sub-barrier data are about three\norders of magnitude larger than the ZPM predictions. This\nis a surprising result since both systems are in fact quite\nsimilar (same target and also same mass of the projectiles).\nWe have investigate, as follows, whether this difference could\nbe reduced by introducing modifications in some parameters\ninvolved in the theoretical calculations.\nAs commented earlier, the nuclear and Coulomb defor-\nmations should present similar, but not necessarily the same\nvalues as assumed in the ZPM calculations. On the other hand,\nthe \u03b2 values were obtained from the transition amplitudes\n[Eq. (27)], which are those from Refs. [39,40]. The exper-\nimental transition amplitudes have, of course, experimental\nuncertainties. For instance, the B(E2) experimental datum\nfor 40Ca has uncertainty of about 16% [39] that results in\nan uncertainy of about 8% in the corresponding \u03b22 value.\nTherefore, there is room for small modifications in the \u03b2 values\nof the ZPM calculations. To fit the data for 40Ca + 116Sn\nwe have included in our analyses an adjustable factor (the\nsame for target and projectile) that renormalizes the \u03b2 values\npresented in Table I. The dotted lines in Fig. 24 represent\nthe corresponding results. A much better agreement between\ndata and theoretical cross sections is now obtained. However,\na large and probably unrealistic factor of 1.4 is necessary to\nrenormalize the \u03b2 values. Evidently, this difference would be\neven more significant if the factor were applied only relative\nto the \u03b2 values of 40Ca (the results for 40Ar + 116Sn indicates\nthat the \u03b2 values for 116Sn should not be renormalized).\nAnother possibility to explain the difference between the\nbehavior of the 40Ar + 116Sn and 40Ca + 116Sn is related to\nthe bare SP potential. In the present work, we have assumed\nthe SP potential in the context of the systematics for the matter\ndensities. This systematics has been based [19] on theoretical\ncalculations with the Dirac-Hartree-Bogoliubov model and\nalso on experimental results for charge distributions. As\nassumed here, within the systematics for the densities the radii\nof the 2pF distributions are well represented by Eq. (25), with\na diffuseness value of a = 0.56 fm. However, these radius\nand diffuseness values represent an average behavior obtained\nconsidering the results for a large number of nuclei. Of course,\nsmall deviations around these average values are expected due\nto the effects of the structure of the nuclei. In Ref. [19], these\nvariations were analyzed and standard deviations of \u03c3R =\n0.07 fm and \u03c3a = 0.025 fm, relative to the average radius and\ndiffuseness values, respectively, were found. So, it is possible\nto treat R0 and a as adjustable parameters. In Ref. [19] we\nhave demonstrated that the barrier height is more affected by\nvariations in the diffuseness value than in the radius. Thus,\nfor 40Ca + 116Sn we have assumed the diffuseness of the\ndensities (same value for projectile and target) as an adjustable\nparameter to fit the data. The corresponding result is shown\nas dash-dotted lines in Fig. 24. A very good description of the\ndata is now obtained, with a = 0.62 fm. At first thought, this\ndiffuseness seems to be reasonable. Nevertheless, this value\ndiffers from the average diffuseness (a = 0.56 fm) by more\nthan two standard deviations \u03c3a = 0.025 fm. This difference is\neven more significant because it was applied to both projectile\nand target nuclei. This apparently small modification of the\ndiffuseness value from 0.56 fm to 0.62 fm represents, in\nfact, a large variation of about 50% in the strength of the\nundeformed nuclear potential at the s-wave barrier radius.\nIn Fig. 25 we present theoretical Dirac-Hartree-Bogoliubov\nresults for the matter densities of the 40Ar, 40Ca, and 116Sn\nnuclei (see symbols). In the same figure, 2pF distributions\nwith different diffuseness values are also shown by solid and\ndashed lines. As expected, the average diffuseness value of\nthe systematics [19], a = 0.56 fm, represents a much better\nresult for the densities of the three nuclei than a = 0.62 fm.\nFurthermore, the theoretical density of the 40Ca nucleus is\nvery similar to that for 40Ar. However, if we consider the same\na = 0.62 fm, obtained from fusion data fit for 40Ca, also for the\n40Ar + 116Sn system, it results in a large disagreement between\nfusion data and ZPM calculations (see Fig. 24). We point out\nthat the fusion data for 40Ca + 116Sn could be well fitted by\nconsidering variations in the radii instead of the diffuseness\n044606-11\nNOBRE, CHAMON, GASQUES, CARLSON, AND THOMPSON PHYSICAL REVIEW C 75, 044606 (2007)\n0 2 4 6 8\n10-3\n10-2\n10-1\n\u03c1 \n(fm\n-\n3 )\nr (fm)\n \n116Sn\n \n40Ca\n \n40Ar\n a = 0.56 fm\n a = 0.62 fm\nFIG. 25.

In this case, we found a variation of \u000eR0 \u2248\n0.24 fm, which is also unrealistic since the standard deviation\nfor the nuclear radii is only \u03c3R = 0.07 fm.\nObviously, much better agreement between fusion data and\nZPM calculations could be obtained for all systems presented\nin this work if we had assumed a and\/or \u03b2 as adjustable\nparameters. However, this procedure is appropriate only when\nthe resulting parameter values are within certain acceptable\nregions. This is a very important subject since in many\nworks the bare potential contains adjustable parameters. In\nthis work, we have demonstrated that an apparently small\nvariation of 0.06 fm in the diffuseness value (or 0.24 fm\nin the radius) is in fact not realistic and may hide other\npossible important characteristics of the system. We point out\nthat such a conclusion is much easier to obtain if the data\nanalysis is performed without using any adjustable parameter.\nThe discrepancies between the similar 40Ar + 116Sn and\n40Ca + 116Sn systems are probably related to some effect of\nstructure. For instance, the couplings to transfer channels may\nresult in different contributions to the fusion process.\nWe turn now to the problem of extreme sub-barrier energies\nthat is discussed in many recent works (e.g., [6\u201310]). In\nsome works, the concept of extreme sub-barrier energies has\nbeen related to very small fusion cross sections. For instance,\nin the case of 64Ni + 64Ni [8] the experimental datum at\nthe lowest energy (at E \u2248 VB0 \u2212 10 MeV\u2014see Fig. 21)\ncorresponds to a cross section value about 10\u22125 mb. However,\nseveral systems studied here have cross sections measured at\nenergies even lower (relative to the barrier height), with cross\nsection values significantly larger. For example, at E \u2248 VB0 \u2212\n17.5 MeV, in the case of 40Ca + 192Os (Fig. 11), one can\nobserve a measured cross section about 10\u22121 mb. Clearly,\nin this case the cross section is much larger than that for\n64Ni + 64Ni because the corresponding enhancement due to\ninelastic couplings is larger. Thus, we relate the term \u201cextreme\nsub-barrier energy\u201d to low values of energy relative to the\nbarrier height instead of small cross sections.\nIn some works, it has been observed that the diffuseness\nvalues for potentials adjusted to reproduce fusion data are\nsignificantly larger than those usually assumed for elastic\nscattering data analyses. The nuclear interaction assumed\nin the present ZPM calculations has also been successfully\napplied to the elastic scattering process. It has also been\nreported that the fusion data at extreme sub-barrier energies\nhave not been well described by CC calculations. For instance,\nin the case of 64Ni + 64Ni detailed CC calculations were\nperformed using adjustable parameters in the bare potential\nto fit the higher energy fusion data [8]. However, at energies\nfar below the barrier the data exhibit a much steeper falloff in\ncomparison with those theoretical results. The present ZPM\ncalculations support this finding (see Fig. 21).\nAs already commented, for most of the systems studied here\nthe ZPM predictions reproduce the data within two orders of\nmagnitude. In Fig. 24 one can observe larger enhancements\nrelative to BPM for lower energies (left panel). Since these\nenhancements arise from the effects of the couplings, a larger\ndispersion of the data relative to the ZPM cross sections (right\npanel) is expected for lower energies. However, no brusque\nchange seems to be detected in the average behavior of the\nfusion cross section when approaching extreme sub-barrier\nenergies. Even so, a more quantitative calculation may change\nthis picture. To investigate this point, we have calculated\naverage values for the order of magnitude of the deviations\nbetween fusion data and ZPM cross sections. We have divided\nthe data presented in Fig. 24 (right panel) in consecutive bins\nof 2 MeV. For each bin we have calculated the average value of\nlog(\u03c3F\/\u03c3ZPM), and we have defined average values for the order\nof magnitude through the following expression \u3008\u03c3F\/\u03c3ZPM\u3009 =\ne\u3008log(\u03c3F\/\u03c3ZPM)\u3009. The corresponding results are presented in\nFig. 26. From above barrier energies to 5 MeV below the\nbarrier, in average the ZPM predictions agree with the data\nwithin 10% precision (see Fig. 26). For \u221215 \u0001 E \u2212 VB0 \u0001\n\u22128 MeV, in average the ZPM slightly overestimates the\nmeasured cross section by a factor about two. At extreme\nsub-barrier energies, the data are almost about two orders of\nmagnitude smaller that the theoretical predictions. Evidently,\nthese results for average values should be considered in a\nrestricted sense because they refer only to the particular fusion\ndata set analyzed here.\n-20 -15 -10 -5 0 5\n10-2\n10-1\n100\n101\n<\n\u03c3\nF\/\u03c3\nZP\nM\n>\n(EC.M.-VB0) (MeV)\nFIG. 26.

PHYSICAL REVIEW C 75, 044606 (2007)\nV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\nIn our theoretical calculations, we have assumed the SP\npotential that has been successful in describing peripheral\nchannels for several systems in a wide energy range. Thus,\nthe nuclear interaction used here to describe the fusion is also\ncompatible with the heavy-ion elastic scattering process. The\nZPM model takes into account the effect of the excitation\nenergy of harmonic vibrational modes in the calculation of\ntransmission coefficients. The model represents an approxi-\nmate solution for the problem of a large number of coupled\ninelastic states. At very low energies the usual procedure\nof CC codes of solving a large number of CC equations\nmay present numerical problems, while the ZPM results are\nquite accurate. Thus, the ZPM model is quite appropriate\nto solve problems where a large number of inelastic states\npresent significant contribution to the fusion process, due to\ncorresponding small excitation energies and large coupling\nstrengths. The tunneling process strongly depends on the\nbarrier height, which is related to variations of the distance\nbetween the surfaces of the nuclei. Thus, heavy-ion fusion\nis quite sensitive to vibrations of the nuclear densities. We\nhave used the SP potential in the context of the systematics\nfor the nuclear densities. Therefore, no free parameters were\nassumed in our calculations. We have analyzed fusion data for\n64 heavy-ion systems involving even-even nuclei. Obviously,\nthere are many other systems for which fusion data have\nbeen measured, but the present data set is clearly quite\nrepresentative. Taking into account the lack of adjustable\nparameters, the overall agreement between fusion data and\ntheoretical ZPM predictions obtained here can be considered\nquite satisfactory, within only two orders of magnitude for\nalmost all the systems, including the region of extreme sub-\nbarrier energies. Therefore, the large enhancements of the data\nrelative to undeformed BPM calculations, that reach eleven\norders of magnitude at very low energies, are mostly due to\nthe effect of the couplings to inelastic states. The remaining\ndifferences between data and ZPM cross sections can be\nrelated to several points: (i) couplings to transfer channels\nthat are not included in our calculations, (ii) the assumption\nof the vibrational model for all nuclei, (iii) the assumption\nthat \u03b2N = \u03b2C , etc. Furthermore, part of these differences\ncould also be associated to the effect on the bare potential of\nvariations around the corresponding adopted average values of\nthe parameters assumed for the nuclear densities. Therefore,\nthere is room for variations in the bare potential to obtain a\nbetter agreement between data and theoretical cross sections.\nIn fact, we have demonstrated that significant improvement of\nthe data description can be obtained if adjustable parameters\nrelated to coupling amplitudes and\/or nuclear densities are\nassumed to fit the data. However, this procedure is justified\nonly when the resulting values for these parameters are within\ncertain acceptable regions. Indeed, we showed that even an\napparently small variation of the nuclear diffuseness could\nbe unrealistic and could hide a different characteristic of\na particular system. This is a very important subject since\nin many works the bare interaction is related to adjustable\nparameters. Of course, several approximations have been\nassumed in our model, such as assumption of an infinity\nbasis of harmonic oscillator states, neglecting the fact that\nthe excitation of each surface mode corresponds to a finite\ntransfer of angular momentum, assuming no effect of the\ndeformation on the barrier curvature of the effective potential,\nand so on. Obviously, very complicated problems, such as\nthe present question of heavy-ion collisions, always demands\nsome degree of simplification. Therefore, if no adjustable\nparameters are included in the analyses, one can not expect\na perfect agreement between theoretical predictions and data.\nIn the context of averages performed over the complete data\nset, the ZPM model describes the fusion data from the barrier\nto energies as low as 15 MeV below the barrier within\na small factor of about two, but overestimates the fusion\nprocess at extreme sub-barrier energies by about two orders\nof magnitude. We presented the advantages and limitations of\nthe ZPM model as a tool to predict heavy-ion fusion cross\nsections. The ZPM calculations have been performed using\nthe computational code SPZPM. Optical model calculations of\nelastic scattering cross sections using the SP potential can be\nperformed by the SPOMC code. Both codes are available under\nrequest to L. C. Chamon.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was partially supported by Financiadora de\nEstudos e Projetos (FINEP), Fundac\u00b8a\u02dco de Amparo a` Pesquisa\ndo Estado de Sa\u02dco Paulo (FAPESP), and Conselho Nacional de\nDesenvolvimento Cient\u0131\u00b4fico e Tecnolo\u00b4gico (CNPq).\n[1] A.
