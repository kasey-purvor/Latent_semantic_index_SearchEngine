Introduction \nRecently, several models for cell patterning have been proposed based on the \nmechanochemical processes occurring i  the early embryo. Such models have \nbeen applied to the formation of bones or of skin organ primordia, for example, \nfeathers and scales [1-5]. These models are mathematically complex and their \ninitial analyses has been based mainly on linear.theory or numerical simulation \n[6]. However, recently, simple versions of the nonlinear models have been \nanalysed [7-9]. These analyses have been carried out in parameter domains \nwhere the linear theory predicts the initial growth of a single spatial mode, and \nhave studied the evolution of such a mode. In other parameter regimes, however, \nlinear theory suggests that it is possible to isolate two spatial modes which may \nsuperimpose giving rise to a pattern which has two characteristic wavelengths. \nThis has been observed in numerical simulations of one of the models [5, 10], \nproposed for scale pattern formation in the armadillo. To analyse the full \nnonlinear system in this case is a formidable task. Recently, such an analysis has \nbeen carried out for special simple cases of the model [ 10]. In this paper, we \n308 P.K. Maini \nstudy a simple one-dimensional caricature model that gives similar predictions \nfrom linear analysis to the models mentioned above. In Sect. 2 we present he \nmodel and its linear analysis. In Sect. 3 we analyse the full nonlinear model for \na restricted set of initial conditions and show that, depending on the initial \nconditions and the parameters of the model, it is possible either to get mode \nisolation or superposition of modes. The results of the nonlinear analysis are \ncompared to those from numerical simulation in Sect. 4. \n2. Model and linear analysis \nThe model mentioned above is a very complex system, consisting of five highly \nnonlinear equations. In an attempt to analyse such a system, we look at a much \nsimpler model which captures the linear behaviour of the more complex system. \nThe idea of setting up a simple caricature quation to study a more complicated \nsystem is not unusual (see, for example, [ 11]). We chose a caricature model of the \nform \nwhere \nLu  = - u p \n3u \nLu  = ~ + ~u - 2u, \n(2.1) \nwhere x and t are space and time respectively, u = u(x,  t), ~, f l  and 2 are real \nnumbers (without loss of generality we take ~ <\/1, ~, \/1 positive) and p is an \ninteger greater than 1. The right hand side of (2.1) is the simplest possible type \nof nonlinearity, chosen to simplify the analysis. \nThe spatially uniform steady states of (2.1) satisfy \n(O~4fl 4 -  ,~)U = - -U  p \nthat is \nu=0 or u=(2-a4f14)  1\/(p- l ) .  (2.2) \nWe examine the linear stability of the zero steady state by considering small \nperturbations from u = 0 for which nonlinear terms may be neglected. Letting \nu(x, t) = a(x, t), In(x, t) I ,~ 1 (2.3) \nand substituting into (2.1) and neglecting nonlinear terms, we have the linearised \nequation \nd~ \nO---t + ~a - 2n = 0. (2.4) \nAs usual we look for solutions of the form \nnot  e ' '  + ikx (2.5) \nCaricature of a model for morphogenesis 309 \nk 2 \n~,>0 \nh=O \nk<O \nFig. 1. Sketch of the dispersion relation \n(2.6) for different 2. For 2 < 0, \na(k 2) < 0 Vk 2 and the uniform steady \nstate u = 0 is linearly stable. For 2 = 0, \ntr(k 2) = 0 at k 2 = ct 2, #2 and u = 0 is \nmarginally stable. For 2 > 0, u = 0 is \nlinearly unstable to perturbations of \nwave numbers in the neighbourhood of \n~t or f l  \nwhere a is the temporal  growth rate of  an initial perturbation of  wave number k \n(see, for example, [12]). Substituting (2.5) into (2.4), the solvability condition \nleads to the dispersion relation \na(k 2) = 2 - (k 2 - e2)2(k2 - fl2)2 (2.6) \nwhich is sketched in Fig. 1. Clearly, 2 plays the role of  the bifurcation parameter \nin this case with 2 = 0 being the bifurcation value. I f  2 < 0, then a(k 2) < 0 Vk 2. \nThus all initial perturbations die away exponentially in time and the uniform \nsteady state u = 0 is linearly stable. For  2 -- 0, the uniform steady state u = 0 is \nmarginally stable because perturbations of wave number  ~t or fl have zero linear \ntemporal  growth. I f  2 > 0, then tr(k 2) > 0 for two sets of  wave numbers, one in \nthe neighbourhood of  e, the other in the neighbourhood of  ft. Linear analysis \npredicts that these wave numbers will grow unboundedly. This type of  linear \nbehaviour is similar to that of  the original model [5]. As these wave numbers \ngrow, the nonlinear term in (2.1) becomes important and the linear analysis is no \nlonger valid. We now examine nonlinear effects. \n3. The weakly nonlinear ease \nWe shall restrict our analysis to the case of  a cubic nonlinearity, that is, p = 3 in \n(2.1), and consider the case of  a domain, normalised to unit length, with zero flux \nboundary conditions. Thus, we consider the problem \nLu= -u  3 x e(O,  1) \n(3.1) \nO\" \nO\"u(0, t )=  u with x----- ~ ~ (1, t) = 0 Vt, n = 1, 3, 5, 7. \nTo analyse the weakly nonlinear case we assume 2 is very close to its bifurcation \nvalue of  0 and use a multit ime scale perturbation procedure (see, for example, \n[13]). In order to find the asymptotic solution in time we introduce a long time \n310 P.K. Maini \nscale T. That is, we set \n2 = e 2, T = e2t, u(x, t, T) = ~ eiui(x, t, T) (3.2) \ni=1 \nwhere 0 < E ,~ 1. Substituting (3.2) into (3.1) gives \nLo(EUl+\u00a32u2+ \"'') =,z(1 -  ~T)(EUl \"q-,2U2 +\"\"  \" ) -  (,Ul -Ji- E2U2 + \u2022 \u2022 \") 3 \n(3.3) \nwhere Lou = (Ou\/Ot) + Nu. \nEquating coefficients of powers of E in (3.3) leads to a hierarchy of equations \nto determine the functions uv At O(E), (3.3) is \nLoul = 0 \nwith boundary conditions \ndnUl ( o, t, T) = O, O\"ul(1, t ,T )=O,  n = 1,3, 5,7. \nOX n OX n \nThe general solution of such a problem is \nu~ = Y~ e'(k'~'X(z, r, kin) \nm \nwhere NX(x, T, km) = 0 and X satisfies the boundary conditions. \nThe linear analysis predicts that only wavelengths \u2022 and \/~ grow (at the \nslightly supercritical conditions considered here). We assume that \n0e = mr, \/~ = mrr (3.4) \nwhere n and m are integers (n < m), and that we can ignore the t time scale and \nconsider temporal growth on the T time scale since only modes with wavelength \nor \/ \/grow,  and they grow slowly. To simplify the analysis further, we restrict \nourselves to purely periodic disturbances (in space). Thus, the solution at O(~) is \nUl(X, T) = A(T)  cos ~x + B(T) cos\/~x (3.5) \nwhere A(T) and B(T) are functions of T to be determined. The O(E z) terms give \na similar expression for u2(x, T). The O(E 3) terms are \nLou3 = ul - u 3 c~ul OT\" (3.6) \nSecular terms arise at this stage and must be suppressed in order for u3 to \nremain bounded. Note that the cubic term in (3.6) contains terms of the form \ncos 3ex, and cos(2e -\/~)x. These terms will be secular if\/~ = 3e. We consider the \ntwo cases\/~ \u00a2 3e,\/~ = 3e. \nCase ~ ~ 3~.

Thus, as T--* oo, ul(x) asymptoti- \ncally approaches one of the forms \n(3.11). Clearly, depending on the initial \nconditions at T = 0, it is possible for ul \nto tend to a spatial pattern with two \nsuperimposed wavelengths \n4. Numerical results \nTo solve (3.1) numerically, we use the pseudo-spectral method (see [14], for \nexample). Briefly the pseudo-spectral method approximates the solution to (3.1) \nby \nN \nu(x, t) ~- ~, aj(t)~bj(x) (4.1) \nj= l  \nwhere tpj(x) are the eigenfunctions of the operator ~ defined in (2.1) satisfying \nthe boundary conditions (3.1). Clearly \nq~j(x) = cosjgx. \nSubstituting for u(x, t) into (3.1) we have one nonlinear equation which describes \nthe time evolution of the amplitudes aj(t). We then assume that this holds at \nthe points xl, x2 . . . . .  xn (the collocation points). Thus, we now have N coupled \nnonlinear evolution equations for the N amplitudes and these are easily solved \nusing standard ordinary differential equation solvers. Not only is this a fast \nand efficient method to solve such a system, it also enables us to compare \nthe amplitudes directly with those predicted by the nonlinear analysis of \nSect. 3. \nWe examine the two cases presented in Sect. 3. \nCase fl ~ 3~t. In this case, if the initial conditions favour one of the unstable \nmodes, then the solution evolves to that mode, with amplitude very close to that \npredicted by (3.8). However, if both unstable modes have the same initial \namplitude, the solution evolves to a mixed mode, with each amplitude approxi- \nmately 2 (see Fig. 4a). In this case, the solution seems to be moving towards a \nsaddle point in the phase plane of Fig. 2. \nu O-  \n-0 .5  - \n-1.0 - \n-1.5 \n0 0.3~133 \na \nI I I I \n0.6667 \nx \n1.5 \nC \nI I I I \n0.3333 0.6667 \n\u00d7 \n0.5 -  \nx 10 -1 \n1.0 \n0.5 \nu o \n-0 .5  - \n-1.o - \n-1 .s  \nb \ni i I I I \n0.3333 0.6667 \nx \nCaricature of a model for morphogenesis \n1.5 \n313 \nx 10 -1 \n1 .0-  \nFig. 4a-c.

Depending on the \ninitial conditions, the solution either \nconverges to a mixed mode (b), or a \nsingle mode, (c).

In  this case, the numer ica l  solut ions are in very close agreement  \nwith the non l inear  analysis. Dependent  on initial condit ions,  the solut ions \nevolve to either a mixed mode or  a single mode,  as predicted by (3.11) \n(F ig.  4b,c). \n5. Discussion \nRecent ly ,  several  models  for cell pattern fo rmat ion  based on mechanochemica l  \nprocesses have been proposed.  These models  exhibit  very var ied and complex  \n314 P.K. Maini \nbehaviour. One type of behaviour that has not yet been fully studied analyti- \ncally for these models is that which arises from a dispersion relation of the \nform sketched in Fig. 1. This predicts linear growth of two modes. This type of \nsituation arises in fluid mechanics and the nonlinear interaction of such modes \nhas been studied, giving rise to a phase plane similar to that in Fig. 2 [15, 16]. \nIn that case, the linearly unstable wavenumbers were consecutive. The form of \nthe dispersion relation in Fig. 1, however, enables one to vary the sizes of the \nlinearly unstable wave numbers independently of each other. Numerical simula- \ntion of this case in one and two dimensions hows the possibility of superposi- \ntion of modes of different wavelengths [5, 10]. This particular model, based on \na cell movement system coupled to a reaction diffusion system, has been \nproposed as a mechanism for scale pattern formation in the armadillo. Prelimi- \nnary numerical analyses hows that it predicts patterns qualitatively similar to \nobserved scale patterns [10]. \nThe complexity of these models makes an analytic study for such a case a \nformidable task. Recently, a nonlinear analysis has been carried out for the full \nsystem [10]. The analysis excludes cases where there is a special relation \nbetween the two unstable wave numbers which would give rise to extra secular \nterms. In this paper, in an attempt o gain some insight into the expected \nbehaviour of such systems, we have analysed a simple caricature model giving \nrise to similar linear behaviour and have included the case where extra secular \nterms do arise. To simplify our analysis, we restricted our attention to the case \nof a cubic nonlinearity (p = 3) and to periodic spatial disturbances. \nThe nonlinear analysis of Sect. 3 shows that it is possible to get super- \nposition of modes, depending on initial conditions and the relationship between \nthe unstable modes. The results are in good agreement with numerical solu- \ntions. This analysis suggests that superposition of modes occurs only in special \ncases. In the original model it is possible to get superposition of modes in \nthe case fl = 5~ independent of the initial conditions (see [10]) whereas, in \nthe caricature model, this occurs only for special initial conditions (Fig. 4a). \nThus, the caricature model does not capture all of the behaviour of the full \nsystem, but does enable analysis of certain cases which are formidable in the \nfull system. \nAcknowledgement.
