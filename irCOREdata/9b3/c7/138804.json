Introduction\nFor conventional biological nutrient removal (BNR) processes, Chemical oxygen\ndemand (COD) acts as a limiting factor for phosphorus release and denitrification,\nespecially for wastewaters with lower COD\/N ratios (Kuba et al., 1993, 1996;\nMeinhold et al., 1999). The discovery of denitrifying phosphate-accumulating\norganisms (DNPAOs) in enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) processes\n2offers an appropriate solution to the problem associated with the limitation of COD\n(Kuba et al., 1993; 1994; 1996). DNPAOs are capable of anoxic phosphorus uptake\nby using nitrate\/nitrite (NO3-or NO2-) instead of oxygen as electron acceptors, thereby\nremoving nitrogen and phosphorus simultaneously without any extracellar carbon\nsource (Kuba et al., 1994; 1996). They are activated under the alternate\nanaerobic\/anoxic conditions and have metabolic characteristics similar to those of\nphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAOs) (Murnleitner et al., 1997; Mino et al.,\n1998; Ahn et al., 2001). Applying DNPAOs in BNR processes makes it possible to\nsave COD (50%) and energy (aeration) (30%) with less sludge production (50%)\n(Kuba et al., 1997; Copp et al., 1998).\nSome new denitrifying phosphorus removal processes, such as the\nanaerobic-anoxic\/nitrifying sequencing batch reactor (A2N-SBR), DEPHANOX\n(continuous-flow), modified UCT (University of Cape Town) and biological-chemical\nphosphorus and nitrogen removal (BCFs), based on the activities of DNPAOs have\nbeen proposed in the past (Vlekke et al.,1988; Wanner et al.,1992; Kuba et al.,1996;\n1997; Bortone et al.,1999; Hao et al., 2006). The processes promote DNPAOs and are\nsuitable for low-COD wastewater treatment. The A2N-SBR process, which couples an\nanaerobic-anoxic SBR with a nitrification SBR as a two-sludge system, is one of the\nprominent denitrifying phosphorus nitrogen removal processes. A laboratory-scale\nstudy by Kuba et al. (1997) indicated that A2N-SBR showed steady phosphorus and\nnitrogen removals which enabled the removal of 15mg P\/L and 105mg N\/L at the\nexpense of only 400 mg COD\/L acetate (HAc), i.e. the optimal influent ratio was as\nlow as 3.4 g COD\/g N. Additionally, A2N-SBR integrates two SBRs which means it\nis easy to change operations, such as cycle times and flow rates (Irvine et al., 1997;\nDel Solar et al., 2004; Bungay et al., 2007). Therefore, the A2N-SBR has higher\nflexibility and has been regarded as effective, especially for small wastewater\ntreatment plants.\nMany studies have been dedicated to the behavior of DNPAOs, most of which were\ncarried out with enriched PAO\/DNPAO cultures using acetate as a sole source of\nvolatile fatty acids (VFAs) in the influent synthetic wastewater (Kuba et al., 1994;\nBond et al., 1999; Sudiana et al., 1999; Merzouki et al., 2001; harper et al., 2003;\nMahendraker et al., 2005). However, few investigations have been conducted on the\nreal wastewater. The quality of real sewage is known to fluctuate widely throughout\nday and night, easily resulting in unstable treatment performance. On the other hand,\nthe wastewater characteristics, e.g. influent ratios of C, N and P, are of primary\nimportance for designing BNR processes. These guide the process design and\nconfiguration required to achieve the desired treatment. Moreover, the fraction of\nnitrogen and phosphorus, which is removed by each biological mechanism, depends\nstrongly on the COD\/N and COD\/P ratios of the wastewater (Mahendraker et al.,\n2001). In this instance, the effect of the influent nutrient ratio is one of the most\nsignificant issues in assessment of the performance of the A2N-SBR process,\nespecially in regard to guaranteeing the steady denitrifying phosphorus removal.\n3In addition, it has been found that the monitoring and regulation of online parameters\nsuch as pH, DO, ORP and nutrient pollutants (phosphorus and\nNH4+-N\/NO2--N\/NO3--N) can be helpful in achieving and maintaining high nutrient\nremoval for treating real municipal wastewater (Lee et al., 2001; Wu et al., 2007).\nTherefore, a real-time control for process optimization is expected to be considered in\nthe A2N-SBR process.\nIn this study, an A2N-SBR system was operated in order to gain a better\nunderstanding of the correlation between the influent nutrient ratios and the final\nnutrient removal efficiency; seek a reliable hydraulic retention time (HRT) for\ncomplete phosphorus removal with the variable influent nutrient ratios and examine\nthe feasibility of establishing a real-time control strategy for A2N-SBR for steadier\noperating.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Process setup and operation\nA laboratory-scale A2N-SBR characterized by the two-sludge system consisted of two\nreactors, i.e. A2-SBR and N-SBR. The SBR was made from transparent Plexiglas with\na tapered bottom. The working volumes of the two SBRs were both 12 L with the\ninner diameter of 190 mm and a height of 700 mm. A peristaltic pump was used to fill\nthe A2-SBR with the domestic wastewater from the influent tank during the fill phase.\nA mechanical mixer with a rectangular paddle was installed over the A2-SBR tank\nand an air pump supplied air through a porous stone diffuser, located at the bottoms of\nthese two SBRs.\nThe A2-SBR, operating for denitrifying phosphorus removal, was inoculated with\nsludge from Hangzhou Sibao Sewage Treatment Plant (China). The sludge retention\ntime (SRT) of the A2-SBR was 18-20 days and the concentration of mixed liquor\nsuspended solids (MLSS) ranged between 3800 mg\/L and 4400 mg\/L. The N-SBR\npacked with \u201cPall rings\u201d as a biofilm carrier was operated under aerobic conditions\nfor nitrification. The whole operation cycle for A2N-SBR was approximately 13 h. A\ntypical cycle consisted of six phases as described in Table 1. The reaction time for\neach phase was controlled by a timer automatically and the whole experiment\n(including set-up) was conducted at a temperature of 22 to 25\u2103. Reactor control and\ndata acquisition (pH, DO and ORP) were taken with the software package (WTW\ninolab). pH was not controlled throughout the experiment.\n2.2. Domestic wastewater\nThe domestic wastewater for this experiment was taken from a septic tank on the\n4campus of Zhejiang University of Technology (China). The average concentrations of\nCOD, Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), total nitrogen (TN), NH4+-N and\nphosphorus in the influent wastewater over the experimental period were 237\u00b158\nmg\/L, 145\u00b198 mg\/L, 37\u00b121 mg\/L, 35\u00b120 mg\/L and 12\u00b15 mg\/L, respectively. The pH\nof the influent varied between 6.81 and 7.88 with the mean value of 7.20. As the mean\ninfluent NH4+-N concentration during the spring semester was found to be\napproximately 25 mg\/L lower than that of the autumn semester, a spike of nitrate\n(KNO3) of 10mg\/L NO3--N was added to the initial anoxic phase to ensure there was\nno limitation of electron acceptors for a complete phosphorus uptake. Meanwhile,\nKH2PO4 was added to obtain the different influent phosphorus loading.\nTable 1 the operating procedure for the A2N-SBR process\n2.3. Experimental approach\nThe operational conditions for A2N-SBR during two experimental periods, defined as\nRun 1\u20137, are summarized in Table 2. During period I undertaken within the autumn\nsemester, KH2PO4 was added to vary influent phosphorus loads. For period II\nconducted during spring semester, the anoxic and aerobic reaction times were\nadjusted manually according to the varied effluent quality to determine the optimal\nHRT. After each cycle, the PAO\/DNPAO sludge was washed twice by tap water to\nkeep the parallel experimental conditions.\nTable 2 Experimental approach for A2N-SBR process (aadding nitrate in the\ninitial anoxic phase; bTano-anoxic reaction time; cTn-nitrification reaction time)\n2.4. Analytical methods\nBOD5, PO43--P, TN, NH4+-N, NO2--N, NO3--N and MLSS were analyzed in\naccordance with standard methods (APHA, 1998). The COD was measured with a\n5B-1 type COD quick-analysis instrument (Lanzhou Environmental Technology Co.,\nLtd). The DO and temperature were monitored online using a\nWissenschaftlich-Technische-Werkst\u00e4tte (WTW) oxygen probe. Continuous\nmonitoring of pH and ORP were carried out using two WTW inolab\u00ae pH level 2\nmeters with an ORP electrode and a pH probe (WTW).\n3. Results and Discussion\nDuring the start-up period, the A2N-SBR process operated for 63 days until PO43--P,\nNH4+-N and COD removal efficiencies reached 85%, 99% and 89%, respectively.\nMixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) in the A2-SBR remained between 3800\u20134400\nmg\/L throughout the experimental periods.\n3.1. A2N-SBR performance under the varying influent nutrient ratios\n5Despite the great fluctuation in the feed quality, effluent COD and NH4+-N\nconcentrations for the A2N-SBR were as lower as 39 mg\/L and 6.8 mg\/L (Table 3),\nwhich had met the discharge consents. The biofilm N-SBR performed well throughout\nthe experimental period with NH3-N ions almost completely converting to NO3- or\nNO2-. Also, no significant phosphorus removal was observed in N-SBR during\nnitrification phase. NO3--N was seldom detected in the anoxic effluent, whereas, the\nTN concentration in the final effluent was as high as 8.6 mg\/L (Table 3), mainly due\nto the anaerobic residue NH4+-N existing in the settled sludge, which was transferred\nto anoxic phase directly without being nitrified by the N-SBR. Later, during the\npost-aeration phase in A2-SBR, a fraction of this residual NH4+-N converted to\nNO2--N\/NO3--N without being denitrified.\nTable 3 Performance of A2N-SBR process for removal of COD, NH4+-N, TN\nand P (aaverage data are in parenthesis)\nFor the phosphorus removal, as the influent phosphorus concentration was adjusted in\na broad range to gain the different COD\/P, this subsequently caused a significant\nfluctuation of phosphorus removal efficiency even though the average phosphorus\nremoval efficiency had reached 89% (Table 3). Phosphorus removal efficiency for\neach run will be discussed at the following sections. During the experimental phase\nthe effluent pH ranged from 7.17 to 7.45 with an average value of 7.28.\n3.2. Relationships between measured online parameters (ORP, DO and pH) and\nnutrient-containing ions during one typical cycle of the A2N-SBR\nFigs.1 and 2 show the relationship between the measured online parameters (ORP,\nDO and pH) and the nutrient-containing ions (NH4+-N\/NO2--N\/NO3--N, PO43--P)\nduring a typical cycle at day 241.\nIn A2-SBR, an immediate and sharp increase in pH ranging from 7.06 to a peak of\n7.21 (shown with point A in Fig. 2) was observed at the initial 15 min of anaerobic\nphase which was attributable to the VFAs uptake by DNPAO\/PAO. Then, pH\ndecreased continuously mainly due to the release of orthophosphate (PO43--P) ion. It\nwas also found that the decrease rate of pH had a close correlation with the P-release\nrate (Figs. 1 and 2). After anaerobic reaction for about 70 min, the P-release rate\nbecame relatively low and pH reached a constant value (point B in Fig. 2) that\nprobably indicated the termination of the P-release. Meanwhile, the ORP curve\ndropped continuously throughout the anaerobic process and reached -212mV at the\nend of anaerobic phase. Clearly, the ORP profiles can not exhibit a characteristic\npoint identifying the end of the phosphorus release but online monitoring of the ORP\nfavors to guarantee the strict anaerobic conditions for the better phosphorus release.\nDuring the subsequent anoxic process, a sharp increase of pH was observed along\nwith the prolonged reaction as a result of anoxic phosphorus uptake and\n6denitrification. As to the ORP curve, it was observed to decline initially and then\napproach a plateau (point E in Fig. 2) where the NO3\/NO2 concentrations both\nreached the relatively consistent values (Fig. 1).\nIn the N-SBR, pH increased sharply during the initial 30 min of aeration reaction. It\nwas also found that only the undegradable organic compounds remained in the SBR\nafter the aeration reaction for 30 min, which could be confirmed by the COD\nmeasurement in Fig. 1. Further, after nitrification became the dominant reaction in\nN-SBR, pH dropped initially and then increased to the point C (Fig. 2) corresponding\nto the end of the nitrification (Fig. 1).\nFig. 1. Profiles of COD, PO43--P, NH4+-N, NO3--N and NO2--N variations during\none typical cycle of A2N-SBR process (on day 241) (MLSS=3875 mg\/L;\nT=23-25.5\u2103)\nFig. 2. Variations of DO, ORP and pH during one typical cycle of A2N-SBR\nprocess (on day 241) (MLSS=3875 mg\/L; T=23-25.5\u2103)\nFor the DO variations, in N-SBR a DO plateau (point D in Fig.2) occurred during the\nlatter of nitrification stage, which coincided with the complete ammonia conversion,\nconfirmed by the NH3+-N and NO3--N measurements in Fig. 1. In A2-SBR, during the\npost-aeration phase the end of nitrification was also identified based on the\nbending-points of DO (point F in Fig. 2) and pH (point G in Fig. 2) profiles when the\noxidation of NH4+-N finished (Fig. 1).\n3.3. Effect of influent COD\/P on the A2N-SBR process performance\nAlthough with the great fluctuation of the influent COD\/P ratios, steady anaerobic\nP-release was observed during four operational periods (Runs 1\u20134, period I) with the\naverage concentrations of approximately 40.8 mg P\/L at the end of anaerobic phase\n(Fig. 3). At the beginning of anoxic phase, phosphorus concentration was normally 42\nmg\/L on average, and then decreased to 20.8 mg\/L at the end of anoxic phase as a\nresult of the denitrifying phosphorus uptake. The percentage of the amount of anoxic\nP uptake to overall P uptake was close to 51%. After 2h post-aeration, the final\neffluent P concentration was stable at 2.0 mg\/L (mean value). This finding revealed\nthat the post-aeration phase was indispensable to A2N-SBR process for polishing the\neffluent, as the post aerobic phosphorus uptake accounted for approximately 45% of\nthe phosphorus removal when electron acceptors as NO3--N were not available.\nFig.3. Variations of phosphorus concentration at different reaction phases with\ndifferent influent COD\/P in the A2N-SBR process (The horizontal line A\n7represents the mean anaerobic phosphorus concentration and the line B\nrepresents the mean anoxic phosphorus concentration)\nThe phosphate release and uptake capacity as well as the phosphorus removal in the\nA2N-SBR exhibited different patterns with the different influent COD\/P, as seen from\nFig. 3. In Run 1, the influent COD\/P was 19.4 on average. The mean phosphorus\nconcentrations at the beginning of the anaerobic phase and the final effluent were 11.9\nand 0.5 mg\/L respectively, with the phosphorus removal efficiency of 96% (Table 4).\nFor Run 2, the influent COD\/P decreased to 15.4 by the addition of KH2PO4. The\nmean influent and effluent phosphorus concentrations thereby increased to 15.7 and\n1.6 mg\/L respectively, with the removal efficiency of 90%. Since the phosphorus\nremoval efficiency of Run 2 decreased compared with Run 1 (Table 4), the influent\nCOD\/P was returned to 30.8 in the subsequent Run 3 to recover the phosphorus\nremoval capacity. The phosphorus concentrations of influent and effluent in Run 3\nboth declined to 6.9 and 0.3 mg\/L, respectively, with the increased phosphorus\nremoval efficiency of 97%. For Run 4, the influent phosphorus concentration was as\nhigh as 21.6 mg\/L and the influent COD\/P thus dropped down to 9.5. Consequently,\nwith this shock load the effluent P concentration was above 8.5 mg\/L, resulting in the\nlower phosphorus removal efficiency of 62%.\nTable 4 Comparison of COD\/TN, COD\/P and TN\/P with nutrients removal\nefficiencies for A2N-SBR process (aadding 10 mg\/L nitrate at the beginning of the\nanoxic phase)\nPhosphorus removal efficiencies exhibited an increase trend with the increasing of\ninfluent COD\/P and a linear positive relationship was found between COD\/P and\nphosphorus removal with COD\/P in the range of 7.2 and 19.4 (Fig. 4). When COD\/P\nresearched approximately 13.1, higher phosphorus removal of above 85% was\nachieved in A2N-SBR. Further, when the influent COD\/P continued to be raised up to\n19.4, the phosphorus removal kept at a constant value. This means that further\nincrease of the COD\/P can not promote the phosphorus removal efficiency, mainly\nbecause PAOs or DNPAOs have the maximum capacity for carbon source\nconsumption to synthesis inner Poly-\u03b2-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) that determines the\nphosphorus uptake capacity, and can not consume extra carbon once their PHB\nassimilation capacity researches the threshold.\nFig.4. Relationships between the influent COD\/P and phosphorus removal\nefficiencies in A2N-SBR process\nIn contrast, there were several days when the influent COD\/P varying between 8.8\nand 10.9 in Run 1 (signified by arrow A in Fig. 4), where the phosphorus removal\nefficiencies of over 90% were achieved, which seems debatable. We checked the data\nand found the influent COD, NH4+-N as well as phosphorus concentrations during\n8these days were lower than the normal days due to the weekend holidays. Particularly,\nthe influent NH4+-N concentrations were approximately 10 mg\/L lower than that of\nnormal days and most of the released phosphorus was removed mainly during the\npost-aeration by using oxygen as the final electron acceptors. This means that during\nthese days most of the influent carbon source available had been used only for the\nphosphorus removal, thereby favored to enhance the phosphorus removal\nperformance. In this instance, in the A2-SBR process the impact of the influent\nCOD\/N ratio on the final P removal efficiency should not be neglected.\n3.4. Effect of influent COD\/N and TN\/P on the A2N-SBR process performance\nAs with COD\/P, COD\/TN and TN\/P also play key roles in A2N-SBR for the efficient\nnitrogen and phosphorus removals (Table 5). The TN removal efficiencies have\npositive linear corelation with the influent COD\/TN ratios (n=7) (Fig. 5): the greater\nthe influent COD\/TN, the better the TN removal was obtaind. Futher, TN\/P ratios\nwere found to be closely correlated to the phosphorus removals with the correlation\ncoefficient (r) of 0.8345 (n=7), which confirmed that in A2N-SBR where denitrifying\nphosphorus uptake mechanism is applied, the TN\/P ratio has greater influence on the\nfinal phosphorus removal efficiencies.\nFig.5. Influence of COD\/TN and TN\/P on the nitrogen and phosphorus removal\n(a: the relationships between the influent COD\/TN and TN removal efficiencies;\nb: the relationships between the influent TN\/P and phosphorus removal\nefficiencies; data from Table 5)\nIn our study, no distinct relationship between COD\/TN and phosphorus removal\nefficiencies was found except that it was found the low influent COD\/TN did not\nsignificantly weaken the final phosphorus removals. For example, in Run 2 with the\nlowsest COD\/TN of 3.5, the phosphorus removal efficiency maintained around 88%,\nalthough TN removal efficiency had declined to 66%. This finding is opposite to the\nconventional BNR processes, where the nitrogen removal process always takes\npriority over the phosphorus removal process to utilize the limited carbon source in\nthe influent.\n3.5. Effect of anoxic HRT on the A2N-SBR performance\nIn Run 6 the anoxic HRT was prolonged to 4h with the aim of obtaining the desired\nHRT for the optimal nutrient removal, since in Run 5 the phosphorus concentration at\nthe end of the anoxic phase was as high as 16.7 mg\/L and the corresponding NOx-N\n(electron acceptors) concentration was around 3 mg\/L, which seems that the anoxic\nreaction time of 3h may not be sufficient for the complete anoxic P-uptake and\ndenitrification. Additionally, increase of MLSS by prolonging SRT was also\nundertaken in the A2-SBR to promote the denitrification rate and phosphorus uptake\nrate.\n9Table 5 Effect of the anoxic HRT on the A2N-SBR process performance (mean\nvalues)\nWith the prolonged anoxic HRT in Run 6, the anaerobic P-release and aerobic\nP-uptake both increased greatly (Table 5). A larger amount of phosphorus released\nunder anaerobic condition was suspected to be related to the applied operating\ncondition of long SRT which favored the more accumulation of the PAO\/DNPAO.\nNitrate in the effluent of anoxic phase was under detection limit. Compared with Run\n5, the TN and phosphorus removal efficiencies of Run 6 were improved by\napproximately 12.6% and 25.3%, respectively.\nIn the subsequent Run 7, the anoxic reaction time was returned to 3h to examine the\noperating reliability of the A2N-SBR when the reaction time was shortened. The net\nanaerobic P-release for Run 7 was similar to that of Run 6, i.e. both around 50 mg\/L.\nThis indicated that PHB had been sufficiently synthesized by PAO\/DNPAO during\nthe anaerobic phase. For the net anoxic P-uptake of Runs 6 and 7, it was 36.0 and 33.7\nmg\/L, respectively. The slight difference of the anoxic phosphorus uptake for these\ntwo tests was suspected to due to the \u201cendogenous\u201d phosphorus release during anoxic\nreact period. Actually, the \u201cendogenous\u201d phosphorus release did occur in our study\nwhen no NO3--N was available for DNPAOs in anoxic phase. On day 261 (during\nRun 6), it was found that phosphorus concentration was 20.5 mg\/L at 3h of the anoxic\nreaction, and the corresponding NO3--N concentration was close to 0 mg\/L. Further,\nby extending the anoxic reaction time to 4h, the effluent phosphorus concentration\nincreased to 23.9 mg\/L, indicating that the \u201csecond\u201d phosphorus had taken place.\nSince the real domestic wastewater was used in this study, the nutrient concentrations\nas well as their ratios might vary significantly; thus, the fix-time strategy can not\nensure the optimum reaction time for each biological procedure based on the varying\ninfluent nutrient ratios.\n4. Discussion\n4.1. Effect of the nutrient ratios on the A2N-SBR performance\nThe experiments performed with the different COD\/P revealed that the higher the\ninfluent phosphorus concentrations, the more the phosphorus was released due to the\nmore phosphorus available for PAO\/DNPAO to accumulate as internal poly-P (Fig. 3),\ndespite the similar COD loadings adopted in all tests (Table 4). Same phenomenon\nwas also presented by Sudiana et al. (1999) and Sevour et al. (2003), who explained\nthat more PAOs could be accumulated and activated in the EBPR system with the\nhigher phosphorus loading.\nCompared with the conventional simultaneous phosphorus and nitrogen removal\n10\nprocesses, the A2N-SBR process has saved greater amount of COD consumption for\nthe optimum phosphorus removal by using DNPAOs as a portion of functional PAOs.\nFor example, in Run 1 with the mean phosphorus and COD concentrations of 13.5\nmg\/L and 260 mg\/L respectively, it is impossible to obtain the desired phosphorus\nremoval efficiency as high as 96% in case of the conventional biological phosphorus\nremoval (BPR) processes. Jr Grady et al. (1999) reported that at least 15\u201320 mg BOD\n(or 26\u201334 mg COD) is required for removal of 1 mg P in conventional BPR processes\n(without nitrification), such as Anaerobic-Oxide (A\/O) and Virginia Initiative Process\n(VIP). In the case of five-stage Bardenpho process with the long SRT, more BOD or\nCOD, i.e. over 25 mg BOD\/ 43 mg COD, is required to remove 1 mg P. Therefore, in\nRun 1 the minimum theoretical required COD is estimated to be approximately\n338\u2013442 mg\/L for removal of 13.0 mg P \/L, supposing the effluent phosphorus\nconcentration was 0.5 mg\/L, which is much higher than the actual consumed COD of\n220 mg\/L.\nIn general, high COD\/P favors the improvement of phosphorus removal (Fig. 4);\nhowever, in the A2N-SBR process that based on the denitrifying phosphorus removal,\nthe final P-uptake capacity also greatly depends on the amount of electron acceptors\n(NOx-N), i.e. the influent N\/P ratios. This can be shown from Fig.5b that phosphorus\nremoval effeciencies had close positive relationship with the TN\/P ratios with the\ncorrelation coefficient (r) of 0.8345.\nWith respct to the case of the low influent COD\/TN, it was phosphorus removal rather\nthan nitrogen removal that still maintained at a relatively higher leval, i.e. the low\ninfluent COD\/TN did not deteriorate the phosphorus removal significanly. This\nfinding is contrary to the conventional BNR processes, where better nitrogen removal\ncan be primarily guaranteed if the influent nutrient ratios are lower (Metcalf and Eddy,\n2003). Apparently, the specific A2N-SBR operation mode has maximized the\nphosphorus removal capacity especially with the limitation of carbon source.\nTo promote TN removal in the case of low influent COD\/TN, adding extra carbon\nsource into the anaerobic phase or extending the nitrification reaction time (if the\ninfluent NH4+-N can not convert to NO2--N\/NO3--N completely in N-SBR) are\nappropriate alternatives. By addition of carbon source in anaerobic phase, more\nreadily biodegradable compounds are available to PAO\/DNPAO for synthesis internal\nPHB; thereby the N and P removal efficiencies can be promoted simultaneously.\nHowever, it is worthy noting that the excessively high COD\/TN is prone to result in a\nportion of unconsumed COD residual to the subsequent anoxic phase. This will\nprovide denitrifying ordinary heterotrophic organisms (DNOs) a competitive\nadvantage over DNPAO to utilize a fraction of COD for denitrification (Jr Grady et al.,\n1999). As a result, the electron donors (COD) available to DNPAO are reduced,\nfinally leading to the deterioration of phosphorus removal capacity.\n4.2. Establishing a real-time control strategy for more efficient nutrient removal in\n11\nA2N-SBR\nThe observation of the concentration profiles through a typical cycle for A2N-SBR\nfavors to understand the biochemical reaction and to determine the optimal condition\nfor the individual reaction time (Mahendraker et al., 2005). Yoo et al (2004) reported\nthat in wastewater treatment process the control strategy can be based on the\nidentification of the endpoint after biological reaction. Switching to the next phase\nshortly after the detection of the reaction endpoint provides an optimum solution for\nboth the process performance and the economies of the plant. For the SBR process,\nBungay et al (2007) demonstrated that the flow-proportional cycle times control\nstrategy use the treatment volume more efficiently than fixed cycle times. In our study,\nthe on-line monitoring ORP and pH profiles indicated accurately the biochemical\nreaction procedures for anaerobic P-release, nitrifying denitrification and P-uptake.\nWhilst, the banding-points of DO and pH profiles would make it possible to\ndetermine the end of phosphate release and nitrification. Therefore, it is promising to\nutilize DO, pH and ORP as real-time parameters in A2N-SBR process to obtain the\noptimum react time for each procedure with the varying influent characteristics.\nNevertheless, it is worthy noting that on day 241 the end of the P-uptake was not\npointed out by DO or pH variations (Figs. 1 and 2), probably due to the fact that the\n2h post-aeration reaction was not sufficient for complete phosphorus uptake. This can\nbe shown from Fig. 1 that the final effluent P concentration was still around 3 mg\/L at\nthe end of cycle. The similar study has been conducted by Lee et al. (2001) using an\nanaerobic\u2013aerobic\u2013anoxic\u2013aerobic sequencing batch reactor ((AO)2 SBR, where a\nbending-point occurred on the pH curve indicating the end of P-uptake with a\nprolonged post-aeration reaction. Our experimental findings of a fixed-time control\nproved that a real-time control strategy is essential for A2N-SBR process to obtain\nmore efficient nutrient removal.\nFurther, the tests of HRT effect indicated that the duration for the anaerobic and\nanoxic reactions significantly affected the final nitrogen and phosphorus removals\nespecially for the P removal that is prone to occur \u201csecond phosphorus\u201d release in the\nabsence of electron donors (e.g. COD) and acceptors (e.g. O2 or NOx-N),thereby\nlowering the final phosphorus removal efficiency. Meanwhile, domestic wastewater is\nsubject to wide variations in flow and load (Bungay et al., 2007), certainly resulting in\nthe wide variations of the influent nutrient rations, which has been proved\nsignificantly impact the final nutrient performance of the A2N-SBR. Therefore, in the\nA2N-SBR process retrofitted from the SBR technology, the unsteady performance due\nto the variation of nutrient ratios should overcome by altering the cycle times of an\nSBR based on the real-time control strategy.\n4. Conclusions\n1. The combined effect of COD\/P, COD\/TN and TN\/P determines the final\n12\nnutrient removal performance in the A2N-SBR process. With the increased C\/P,\nthe phosphorus removal efficiency exhibited an upward trend wholly. The\nexperiment with influent COD\/P and COD\/TN of 19.9 and 9.9 achieved\nsimultaneous optimal phosphorus and nitrogen removal of 94 % and 91 %,\nrespectively.\n2. pH, ORP, and DO variations were closely related to the dynamic variations of\nnutrient pollutants in the separate A2-SBR and N-SBR. From the tests of\nvarying anoxic HRT, it demonstrated that the application of pH, DO and ORP\nas real time control parameters to adjust the duration of each case in A2N-SBR\nappears promising, which favors to promote the reliability and stability for the\nsystem operating. The real-time control strategy is complex compared with the\nfixed-time control, but enables the treatment to adjust automatically to match\nthe influent wastewater quality.\n3. Relatively steady nitrogen and phosphorus removals of 86% and 89 % were\nachieved by introduction of DNPAOs in the A2N-SBR despite the significant\nfluctuation in the feed qualities. This indicates that A2N-SBR has great\npotential to treat nutrient pollutant wastewater.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was financed by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)\n(no.50608064; 50628808), Excellent Doctoral Dissertation Nationwide Foundation\n(Grant no. 200756) and the national key Laboratory Foundation.
