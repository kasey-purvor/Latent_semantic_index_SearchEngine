There is a solid body of evidence that patient and physician characteristics influence\ndoctors' management decisions. Relatively little is known about the role of structural issues in the decision\nmaking process. This study focuses on the question whether doctors' diagnostic and therapeutic decisions\nare influenced by the health care system in which they take place. This non-medical determinant of medical\ndecision-making was investigated in an international research project in the US, the UK and Germany.\nMethods: Videotaped patients within an experimental study design were used. Experienced actors played\nthe role of patients with symptoms of CHD. Several alternative versions were taped featuring the same\nscript with patients of different sex, age and social status. The videotapes were shown to 384 randomly\nselected primary care physicians in the three countries under study. The sample was stratified on gender\nand duration of professional experience. Physicians were asked how they would diagnose and manage the\npatient after watching the video vignette using a questionnaire with standardised and open-ended\nquestions.\nResults: Results show only small differences in decision making between British and American physicians\nin essential aspects of care. About 90% of the UK and US doctors identified CHD as one of the possible\ndiagnoses. Further similarities were found in test ordering and lifestyle advice. Some differences between\nthe US and UK were found in the certainty of the diagnoses, prescribed medications and referral\nbehaviour. There are numerous significant differences between Germany and the other two countries.\nGerman physicians would ask fewer questions, they would order fewer tests, prescribe fewer medications\nand give less lifestyle advice.\nConclusion: Although all physicians in the three countries under study were presented exactly the same\npatient, some disparities in the diagnostic and patient management decisions were evident. Since other\npossible influences on doctors treatment decisions are controlled within the experimental design,\ncharacteristics of the health care system seem to be a crucial factor within the decision making process.\nPublished: 29 September 2008\nBMC Health Services Research 2008, 8:198 doi:10.1186\/1472-6963-8-198\nReceived: 13 February 2008\nAccepted: 29 September 2008\nThis article is available from: http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/8\/198\n\u00a9 2008 von dem Knesebeck et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. \nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Page 1 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Health Services Research 2008, 8:198 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/8\/198Background\nThere is an increasing interest in health care variations\nbetween different national systems. Geographic variations\nin health care depending on where the patient lives and\nthe system in which care is received have been shown in a\ncouple of studies, including studies dealing with the man-\nagement of coronary heart disease (CHD) [1-5]. One pos-\nsible explanation for such international variations in\nhealth care lies in different systems of health care financ-\ning and reimbursement that may cause different priorities\nin patient management [6]. According to the 'supplier-\ninduced demand' thesis [7-9] physicians have the ability\nto generate demand and thus, differences in financial\nincentives for providing services could lead to variations\nin health care in different countries. Evidence-based med-\nicine has emerged as an international health care para-\ndigm which promotes the use of tools like disease\nmanagement programs and clinical guidelines, to influ-\nence provider decision making, improve the quality of\ncare and reduce both national and eventually interna-\ntional variations [5]. However, while disease management\nprograms for CHD patients are well established in the US\nand the UK, countries like Germany have just recently\nstarted to build such managed care structures.\nAgainst this background comparative findings from an\ninternational research project on clinical decision making\nin patients with symptoms of CHD are presented in this\npaper. We have chosen three countries, each with a differ-\nent organisation and financing of health care (a largely\nprivate insurance-based health care system in the US, a\nNational Health Service government-supported, tax-based\nsystem in the UK, and a system characterized by decentral-\nized care administered by social security agencies in Ger-\nmany). The aim of the study was to simultaneously\nmeasure the effect of country\/the health care system,\npatient attributes, and physician characteristics on dispar-\nities in clinical decision making of primary care providers.\nThis paper focuses on differences between the countries\nunder study.\nMethods\nExperimental study design\nA factorial experiment with a videotaped patient consulta-\ntion was conducted [10-14]. Due to the experimental\napproach relevant patient (age, gender, social status, race)\nand physician factors (experience, gender) are controlled\nby the study design. Professional actors played the role of\npatients with symptoms of CHD. Patients in the video-\nvignette presented several symptoms that are typical for\nCHD including chest pressure; pressure worsened with\nexertion, stress and eating; relief after resting; discomfort\nfor more than three months; pain through the back\nbetween the shoulder blades; and elevated blood pres-\nsure. Additionally a non-verbal cue was incorporated,\ndemonstrated by the 'Levine fist' (clenched fist to the ster-\nnum) [15,16]. Tape-recorded role-playing sessions were\nconducted with experienced clinical advisors. From these\ntapes one script was developed that was used for all vide-\notapes presented to physicians with appropriate language\n(British English vs. American English) modifications. The\nportrayed patients in the US had American accents, while\nthe very same in the UK had English accents. For the Ger-\nman part of the study the US-videotapes were dubbed by\na professional speaker. To this end, scripts were translated\ninto German and then back into English to identify dis-\ncrepancies between original and back-translation. This\nforward-backward process was repeated until satisfactory\nagreement was attained. To ensure clinical accuracy and\ncomparability with the other two countries the speaker\nwas asked to adhere to the translated script, instead of giv-\ning priority to synchrony. Moreover, care was taken to\nconstruct a culturally neutral medical practice setting for\nthe filming. The patient in the videotapes was portrayed as\nhaving consulted this doctor before and having recently\nreturned from vacation\/holiday. The videos were pre-\nsented to primary care physicians in their own practice\nrooms. Actors on the tapes differ according to their age\n(55 vs. 75 years), gender (male vs. female) and social sta-\ntus (low vs. high depicted by their current\/former occupa-\ntion of a janitor\/cleaner or school teacher) in order to\nmirror respective patient characteristics. In addition race\n(black vs. white) was varied in the US and the UK. As black\npatients in Germany are very rare, this characteristic was\nnot varied in the videos in Germany. One CHD-video was\npresented to each physician. After viewing the tapes the\nphysicians were asked a range of questions concerning\npatient management by using a questionnaire with both\nstandardised and open-ended questions. The physicians\nwere asked what questions they would ask, to name the\nmost likely diagnoses, what their certainty levels were,\nwhich test(s) they would order, which medication(s) they\nwould prescribe, and what lifestyle recommendation(s)\nthey would make if they saw the patient from the video in\ntheir everyday clinical practice. In terms of information\nseeking behaviour, the question was whether the physi-\ncians would ask the patient any additional questions (yes\/\nno) and if so, what kind of question(s) they would ask\n(open ended). In terms of diagnostic decision making,\ndoctors were asked what they thought was going on with\nthe patient (open ended) and how certain they were with\ntheir diagnostic decision (from 0 to 100). Moreover, phy-\nsicians were asked whether they would order any tests for\nthis patient (yes\/no) and to name the tests they would\norder (open ended). In terms of therapy, we wanted to\nknow if doctors would prescribe or recommend any med-\nication (yes\/no), if they would refer the patient to another\nhealth care professional (yes\/no) and when they would\nlike to see the patient again (in days). Finally, physicians\nwere asked if they would recommend any lifestyle advicePage 2 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Health Services Research 2008, 8:198 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/8\/198or behaviour change (yes\/no) and if so, what kind of\nadvice they would give (open ended).\nPhysician sample\nThe study was conducted in the US (Massachusetts), in the\nUK (the West Midlands, Southeast London and Surrey)\nand in Germany (North Rhine-Westphalia). Physicians\nwere randomly selected from lists provided by local\nhealth care organizations. Selection was made within four\nstrata, defined by combinations of the physicians' gender\nand length of clinical experience. In order to get a clear\nseparation by level of experience only physicians with less\nthan 5 years or more than 15 years clinical experience\nwere considered eligible for selection. Moreover, physi-\ncians had to be internists or family practitioners in the US\nand in Germany or general practitioners in the UK. For a\nclear separation by country they had to be trained at a\nmedical school in their respective countries. Altogether\n384 interviews were conducted in the three countries (128\nin each country). For a sample size of 384 physicians the\ndesign has 80% power to detect absolute differences of\n14.5 percent between two groups. For example, if 14.5%\nof physicians would refer a patient to a cardiologist\/spe-\ncialist facility in one country and 29% of physicians\nwould refer a patient to a cardiologist\/specialist facility in\nanother (a difference of 14.5%) then we would expect to\nfind a significant difference (at alpha = 0.05) 80 percent of\nthe time. Randomly selected physicians were sent a letter\nof invitation. Thereafter, these physicians were screened\nover the phone so that eligible doctors could be identified.\nAn appointment was scheduled for the personal one hour\nsemi-structured interview in the physicians practice. Data\nwere collected in 2001\/2002 in UK and the US, and in\n2004\/2005 in Germany. Participating doctors received a\nmodest financial acknowledgement. The response rates\nwere 64.9% in the US, 59.6% in the UK, and 65% in Ger-\nmany. Informed consent was signed by all participating\nphysicians. This consent form was approved as required\nby the US Institutional Review Board and conformed to\nrequirements of UK and German ethics committees. The\noverall study was approved by the New England Research\nInstitutes Institutional Review Board.\nExternal validity\nSince videotaped patients were used, physicians may\nbehave differently under experimental conditions com-\npared with real patients in their everyday clinical work. To\naddress this issue several steps were taken to foster the\nexternal validity of the study design. High effort was\ndevoted to increase the clinical realism of the vignettes.\nDue to the conducted role-play sessions, the scripts are\nbased on clinical experience. At the filming, experienced\nclinicians were present on the set and only professional\nactors were engaged. At the beginning of each interview\nduring the fieldwork doctors were specifically asked how\ntypical the patient on the videotape was, compared to\npatients they encounter in everyday practice. 90.6% con-\nsidered them either very typical or reasonably typical in\nthe US, 91.4% in the UK and 81.3% in Germany. Addi-\ntionally, all physicians viewed the tapes in the context of\ntheir own practice during normal practice hours so that it\nwas likely they encountered real patients before and after\nthey participated in the study. Prior to the interview, all\nphysicians were instructed to view the patient as one of\ntheir own patients, and to respond as they would typically\nrespond in their own practice.\nStatistical methods\nAnalysis of variance was used to assess the country effect\non doctors' diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. Given\nthe balanced factorial design, the main effect due to coun-\ntry is orthogonal to (independent of) the main effects due\nto physicians and patients factors. Tukey's studentized\nrange multiple comparisons were performed to test statis-\ntical significance of differences between the three coun-\ntries. Precise p-values are reported in the tables. P < 0.05\nwas considered to be an indication that the differences\nnoted were statistically significant.\nResults\nInformation seeking behaviour\nTable 1 summarizes major differences between randomly\nsampled physicians in the US, the UK and in Germany in\ntheir information seeking behaviour. After the physicians\nsaw the videotaped patient we wanted to know if they\nwould ask the patient any additional questions. The aver-\nage total number of questions is highest in the US (8.7),\nfollowed by the UK (5.5) and Germany (3.1). Several sig-\nnificant differences regarding topics raised also exist\nbetween the three countries under study. 83% of the US\nphysicians would like to know more about the medical\nhistory, more than in the UK (62%) and in Germany\n(39%). Questioning related to pain differs significantly\nbetween Germany (32%) and the other two countries (US\n62%, UK 57%). All three countries differ significantly\nwith respect to questions referring to the patient's general\nhealth status (US 83% vs. UK 62% vs. Germany 30%). In\nterms of questions about smoking and alcohol consump-\ntion, US and UK physicians do not differ significantly,\nhowever in Germany, physicians' question behaviour is\nsignificantly different. Only 20% of the German GPs\nwould ask about smoking (vs. US 57% and UK 48%) and\nonly 8% would ask about alcohol consumption (vs. US\n34% and UK 31%).\nDiagnosis\nAlthough all physicians in the three countries encoun-\ntered exactly the same patient on the videotape, there are\ncountry differences in the percentage of medical practi-\ntioners who mentioned coronary heart disease as a possi-Page 3 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Health Services Research 2008, 8:198 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/8\/198ble diagnosis. Table 2 shows that 95% of the US, 88% of\nthe UK and 74% of the German physicians mentioned\nCHD when they were asked what they think is going on\nwith the patient. Only Germany significantly differs from\nthe other countries in this regard. After mentioning CHD\nas a possible diagnosis, physicians were asked how certain\non a scale from 0 to 100 they are with their diagnosis (for\nphysicians who did not give a CHD diagnosis, their cer-\ntainty was set to 0). The level of certainty significantly dif-\nfers between the US (58%) and the two other countries\n(UK 46% and Germany 39%). There is no significant dif-\nference in the percentage of general practitioners who\nwould order a test to diagnose a possible CHD between\nthe US (89%) and the UK (80%), but again Germany\n(39%) differs significantly from the other countries. Tak-\ning a look at the total number of tests that were ordered to\ndetect CHD, the same results can be found. Germany sig-\nnificantly differs (0.9 tests) from the US (3.2 tests) and the\nUK (3.5 tests).\nTherapy\nResults on therapy decisions are presented in Table 3. The\nprescribing behaviour differs significantly in all three\ncountries. 67% of the US general practitioners would pre-\nscribe or recommend a medication before having the\nresults of any test ordered. In the UK 48% would do the\nsame, whilst in Germany only 17% of the physicians\nwould prescribe a drug. In terms of referrals to a cardiolo-\ngist there are significant differences between the UK\n(31%) and the other two countries. Referral to another\nmedical specialist significantly differs amongst all coun-\ntries (US 5% vs. UK 30% vs. Germany 52%). Although the\ntime to the next appointment does not significantly vary\nbetween the US (11.3 days) and the UK (13.1 days), Ger-\nman physicians would like to see the patient again signif-\nicantly sooner (5.7 days).\nLifestyle advice\nThe physicians were asked whether they would give any\nlifestyle advice. General practitioners in the US (2.8\npieces) and the UK (2.9 pieces) do not differ in the aver-\nage number of pieces of advice, but the German GPs\nwould give significantly less advice (1.9 pieces) (Table 4).\nCountry differences can additionally be found by the kind\nof advice that was given. Large and significant differences\nare evident for the recommendation to stop smoking (US\n32% vs. UK 55% vs. Germany 9%). The suggestion to\nreduce alcohol consumption was given by 18% of the\nphysicians in the US and 36% in the UK. Only 10% of the\nGerman GPs would raise this topic, but the difference to\nTable 1: Total numbers of additional questions and percentages of physicians who would ask the patient different types of additional \nquestions by country\nCountries\np country Germany UK US Tukey's Multiple Comparison\nNumber of questions (means) < .0001 3.1 5.5 8.7 US > UK > Germany\nQuestions about (%)\npathology .3879 69 77 71 UK = US = Germany\nmedical history < .0001 39 62 83 US > UK > Germany\npain < .0001 32 57 62 US = UK > Germany\nsmoking < .0001 20 48 57 US = UK > Germany\nalcohol < .0001 8 31 34 US = UK > Germany\npsychological state .0226 20 33 35 US = UK > Germany\nsocial .0901 17 14 25 US = Germany = UK\ngeneral < .0001 30 62 83 US > UK > Germany\nTable 2: Coronary heart disease (CHD) diagnosis, certainty of diagnosis and test ordering for CHD by country\nCountries\np country Germany UK US Tukey's Multiple Comparison\nCHD diagnosis (%) < .0001 74 88 95 US = UK > Germany\nCertainty of CHD diagnosis (0\u2013100) < .0001 39 46 58 US > UK = Germany\nTest for CHD (%) < .0001 39 80 89 US = UK > Germany\nNumber of tests for CHD (means) < .0001 0.9 3.5 3.2 UK = US > GermanyPage 4 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Health Services Research 2008, 8:198 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/8\/198the UK and the US failed significance. In addition minor\nnon-significant differences in the advice for weight reduc-\ntion, exercise and diet were found.\nDiscussion\nThis paper focuses on between-country differences in clin-\nical decision making in CHD. Doctors' diagnostic and\nmanagement decisions were compared in three countries\n(US, UK and Germany) with different health insurance\nsystems. To analyse the country effect on doctors' deci-\nsions a factorial experiment with video vignettes was con-\nducted. Working with vignettes is a sophisticated and\nvalid method for measuring the quality of care provided\nby primary care physicians [17]. This design was success-\nfully used in previous studies to estimate the un-con-\nfounded effects of non-medical factors in clinical decision\nmaking [10,18,19]. While this rigorous experimental\nstudy permits excellent internal validity, external validity\nremains a threat. Substantial effort was devoted to pro-\nduce the video vignettes to be as realistic as possible.\nHowever, patient management decisions result from the\ninteraction between physician and patient and from clin-\nical examination. These issues could not be adequately\naddressed in a videotape-based experiment. Furthermore,\ndoctors may have viewed the interview as a test situation.\nThis could possibly bias the answers in the direction of\nsocial acceptability. To avoid this, the doctors were specif-\nically told that the interview is not a test, and that we are\ninterested in their daily work and not in textbook answers.\nWhile there are some methodological limitations, the\ndesign has considerable strengths. The factorial experi-\nment allows the estimation of independent and un-con-\nfounded country effects as it simultaneously controls for\ndifferent types of patient (age, gender, social status, and\nrace) and provider influences (gender and length of clini-\ncal experience) on clinical decision making. Although\nthere are more physician and patient characteristics, these\nare considered important for the decision making process.\nIn addition, the experimental approach with videotaped\npatients offers the possibility to integrate non-verbal signs\nsuch as the 'Levine fist'. To enhance generalizability doc-\ntors were randomly selected.\nEven though all patients reported exactly the same symp-\ntoms, results indicate differences between countries, espe-\ncially between Germany on the one hand and the US and\nthe UK on the other. Minor non-consistent differences\nwere found in patient management between British and\nAmerican physicians (see also [5]): British doctors gave\nlifestyle recommendations regarding alcohol and smok-\ning more often and referred their patients to a cardiologist\nor other medical specialist more frequently. American\ndoctors were more certain about a CHD diagnosis, they\nwould request more additional information from the\npatient, and they provided more prescriptions appropri-\nate to CHD. Physicians in Germany showed a significantly\ndifferent pattern of behaviour. They asked fewer addi-\ntional questions, diagnosed CHD less often, and were also\nTable 3: Therapy decisions by country\nCountries\np country Germany UK US Tukey's Multiple Comparison\nPrescribing appropriate CHD medication (%) < .0001 17 48 67 US > UK > Germany\nReferral to a cardiologist or specialist facility (%) < .0001 19 31 10 UK > Germany = US\nReferral to other medical professional (%) < .0001 52 30 5 Germany > UK > US\nTime to next appointment (days, means)) < .0001 5.7 13.1 11.3 UK = US > Germany\nTable 4: Total Numbers and percentages of physicians who give different types of lifestyle advice and recommendations by country\nCountries\np country Germany UK US Tukey's Multiple Comparison\nTotal numbers of advice (means) < .0001 1.9 2.9 2.8 UK = US > Germany\nAdvice about (%)\ndiet .7507 51 53 55 US = UK = Germany\nsmoking < .0001 9 55 32 UK > US > Germany\nalcohol < .0001 10 36 18 UK > US = Germany\nrelaxation .1873 9 11 5 UK = Germany = US\nexercise .7643 7 9 6 UK = Germany = US\nweight .0824 3 8 2 UK = Germany = USPage 5 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Health Services Research 2008, 8:198 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/8\/198less certain with their diagnosis compared to UK and US\ndoctors. Among German physicians, a minor proportion\nwould order a CHD specific test and if so, they would\norder fewer tests. Medications were prescribed to a lesser\nextent, but patients would see the doctor again sooner.\nFinally the total number of pieces of lifestyle advice given\nto the patient and the kind of advice significantly differs\nfrom the UK and US. Overall, German physicians would\nbe less active in terms of diagnostic and management\nstrategies. The reasons for this discrepancy may be struc-\ntural.\nIn our study physicians were asked how much time they\ndo have for a patient consultation (e.g., for a routine\npatient consultation, American physicians are allocated\non average 18 minutes, British physicians are allocated 10\nminutes, and German physicians are allocated 5.5 min-\nutes). Generally, German physicians have the least time\nfor patient consultations compared with UK and espe-\ncially with US doctors. At the same time, German physi-\ncians would like to see the patient again much sooner.\nThus, physicians in Germany seem to have the smallest\ntime allocation for a single consultation while they would\nsee the patients in smaller intervals. These different time\nrestrictions might cause varying treatment strategies. Fur-\nthermore, there is a relationship between organizational\nstructure and clinical performance [20]. Differing struc-\ntures of health care financing and reimbursement are\nlikely to influence clinical decision making. Thus, charac-\nteristics of the health care system in each country might be\none explanation for the observed country differences.\nAlthough we consider these structural reasons most\nimportant, other explanations can't be ruled out. First,\nthere might be cultural reasons for our results indicating\nthat German physicians are less active in terms of diagnos-\ntic and management strategies than their US and UK col-\nleagues. For example, physicians' behaviour may reflect\ndifferent patient expectations. Secondly, there are possible\nmethodological reasons for the different physicians'\nbehaviour in Germany, as data were collected 3 years later\nthan in the other two countries and vignettes in Germany\nwere dubbed. The slightly different way that the videotape\nwas made may have altered physicians' perception of the\npatient in Germany. However, more than 80% of the Ger-\nman physicians considered the patient on the videotape\neither very typical or reasonably typical compared to\npatients they encounter in everyday practice (in the UK\nand the US this rate was about 90%).\nConclusion\nResults indicate country differences in clinical decision\nmaking related to CHD, especially between Germany on\nthe one hand and the US and the UK on the other. Partic-\nularly structures of health care financing and the state of\nevidence-based care programs can explain the observed\ncountry differences. In this regard, incentives for different\ndiagnostic and therapeutic procedures can be seen as pre-\ndictors of clinical decisions.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nOvdK and MB were responsible for interpreting the data\nand writing the manuscript.
