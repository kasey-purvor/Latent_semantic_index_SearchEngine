Various \nhypotheses have been suggested which generally focus on mechanisms that allow \ncooperative genotypes in different species to maintain interactions over space and \ntime. Here, we emphasise the fact that even within mutualisms (interactions with net \npositive fitness effects for both partners), there may still be inherent costs, such as the \noccasional predation by ants upon aphids. Individuals engaged in mutualisms benefit \nfrom minimising these costs as long as it is not at the expense of breaking the \ninterspecific interaction, which offers a net positive benefit. The most common and \nobvious defence traits to minimise interspecific interaction costs are resistance traits, \nwhich act to reduce encounter rate between two organisms. Tolerance traits, in \ncontrast, minimise fitness costs to the actor, but without reducing encounter rate. \nGiven that, by definition, it is beneficial to remain in mutualistic interactions, the only \nviable traits to minimise costs are tolerance-based \u2018defence\u2019 strategies. Thus, we \npropose that tolerance traits are an important factor promoting stability in mutualisms. \nFurthermore, because resistance traits tend to propagate coevolutionary arms races \nbetween antagonists, whilst tolerance traits do not, we also suggest that tolerance-\nbased defence strategies may be important in facilitating the transition from \nantagonistic interactions into mutualisms. For example, the mutualism between ants \nand aphids has been suggested to have evolved from parasitism. We describe how \nphenotypic plasticity in honeydew production may be a tolerance trait that has \nprevented escalation into an antagonistic arms race and instead led to mutualistic \ncoevolution. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2\nIntroduction 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n \nMutualisms are best conceptualised as reciprocally exploitative relationships \n(Thompson 1982, Janzen 1985, Bronstein 1994, Herre, Knowlton and Mueller 1999) \nand, rather than viewing mutualism and antagonism as separate fields of study, much \ncan be gained from drawing parallels between the two and identifying fundamental \ncoevolutionary processes that govern both types of interaction. Although mutualisms \nare defined as net positive interactions for both partners, they often comprise both \npositive and negative interaction components (van Baalen and Jansen 2001, Bruno, \nStachowicz and Bertness 2003). Organisms benefit from maximising positive \ncomponents towards themselves, even if this is at the expense of costs to the partner. \nThus conflict often occurs within mutualisms, where cheats arise and try to obtain \nbenefits from a partner, yet offer nothing in return, thereby making the interactions \nunstable (the problem of the successful 'defect' strategy in the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma \ngame) (Axelrod and Hamilton 1981). These cheats are less apparent in pure \u2018by-\nproduct mutualisms\u2019 sensu Connor (1995),where partners simply trade unwanted \nwaste products or cheap services (e.g. Matsuda and Shimada 1993); but cheats are \nmost problematic in \u2018investment mutualisms\u2019 where partners pay a cost for the \ninteraction, and this cost can be reneged upon by cheats (e.g. Yu and Pierce 1998).  \n      In this essay, we present an additional hypothesis for the formation and stability of \nmutualisms based on the type of defence trait used by species to cope with the costs of \nthe interaction. We propose that tolerance traits, rather than resistance traits, facilitate \nthe formation of proto-mutualistic interactions. Futhermore, tolerance traits promote \nstability in these interactions, thereby paving the way for further mutualistic \ncoevolution. Interactions between ants and mutualistic aphids may be an example of \nhow tolerance traits have been important in the development and maintenance of \nstability in mutualisms. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3\nDefinitions 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n \nThe distinction between tolerance and resistance traits was first recognised in plant- \nherbivore interactions (Painter 1958, Rausher and Simms 1989, Fineblum and \nRausher 1995, Strauss and Agrawal 1999). To cope with herbivory, resistance traits \n(e.g. thorns, trichomes, leaf tannins) minimise the damage a plant experiences \n(Rausher and Simms 1989) while tolerance traits (e.g. plant compensatory growth in \nresponse to herbivory) reduce the fitness consequences of any damage caused (Painter \n1958). More specifically, tolerance has been defined as the slope of a regression of \nfitness on damage for a group of related individuals (Mauricio, Rausher and Burdick \n1997, Strauss and Agrawal 1999). In this context, resistance would be the ability to \nreduce damage and shift any given interaction towards the y-intercept (zero damage). \nRather than being solely restricted to plant- herbivore interactions, however, \nresistance and tolerance traits are also apparent in other antagonistic relationships, \nsuch as interactions between hosts and parasites (Roy and Kirchner 2000, Koskela, \nPuustinen, Salonen and Mutikainen 2002, Miller, White and Boots 2006, R\u00e5berg, Sim \nand Read 2007).   \n      Whilst damage to plants by herbivores can be reasonably assessed by measuring \ntissue loss, however, the damage caused to hosts by parasites (i.e. internal disruption \nof vital host processes) is less easy to measure directly. Surrogates for damage, such \nas parasite burden, can by used, but there is no guarantee that parasite load is directly \nproportional to the damage done by them. The only way to accurately measure \ndamage to hosts is with recourse to host fitness loss. However, defining damage \nthrough fitness loss and then defining tolerance as the slope of damage on fitness is \nclearly not sensible. Roy and Kirchner (2000) instead define resistance in host- \nparasite interactions as traits that prevent infection or limit its extent, while tolerance \ntraits do not reduce or eliminate infection but instead offset or reduce its fitness \nconsequences. This definition of tolerance focuses on the reduction or elimination of \nthe antagonist, rather than on \u2018damage\u2019 to the host. Indeed, by Roy and Kirchner\u2019s \n(2000) definition of tolerance, it is conceivable that damage to hosts could be reduced \n(the definition of a resistance trait in plants), yet the trait would still be classified as \ntolerance as long as infection levels by parasites were not reduced. Roy and \nKirchner\u2019s (2000) definition is also very specific to host- parasite interactions, \nhowever, and cannot be applied to plants and herbivores. We propose more general \n 4\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \ndefinitions of resistance and tolerance, which encompass all antagonistic interactions \n(see Box 1). In general, resistance traits limit fitness loss to an actor through reducing \nencounters with the antagonist. Tolerance traits limit fitness loss to an actor without \nreducing encounters with the antagonist. \n \nBox 1 6 \n7  \n8 RESISTANCE \nResistance traits limit fitness loss by reducing encounters with an antagonist. 9 \nThis is achieved in one of four ways. The first three mechanisms are often regarded as 10 \n\u2018qualitative resistance\u2019, whilst the last as \u2018quantitative resistance\u2019: 11 \nEvasion- traits that move the organism away from its antagonist (e.g. good hearing, 12 \n13 smell, vision and cooperative alarm behaviours to detect predators, along with \n14 morphological and behavioural adaptations to escape them). \nDeterrence- traits that force the antagonist to move away from the actor (e.g. the 15 \n16 odorous secretions of skunks; toxic secondary chemicals, thorns and trichomes in \n17 plants). \nExclusion- traits that simply maintain an impermeable barrier between actor and 18 \n19 antagonist (e.g intricate floral structures preventing nectar thieves; narrow ostioles of \nfigs preventing seed parasites).  20 \nElimination\/ antibiosis- traits that destroy or harm the antagonist by limiting or 21 \nreducing its growth rate, thereby reducing encounter between actor and antagonist. 22 \n23 (e.g. lymphocyte cells in the immune system that target pathogenic bacteria; plant \nsecondary chemicals which adversely affect insect herbivores *). 24 \n25  \n26 TOLERANCE \nTolerance traits minimise fitness loss to the actor but without reducing 27 \nencounter rate. 28 \n29 Several different categories of tolerance can be identified: \nCompensation- A given level of herbivory causes less fitness loss to plants because 30 \nof efficient tissue regrowth. 31 \n                                                 \n* Natural selection or learning may convert antibiosis traits into deterrence if the insect begins to avoid \nthe plant (antixenosis). \n 5\nBribes- Attacks from antagonists are reduced through the host\/ prey offering 1 \n2 alternative goods or services (e.g. production of high quality honeydew by aphids to \n3 divert ant predation). \nAntidotes- Antagonists may cause incidental damage to hosts that is not adaptive (i.e. 4 \n5 the damage is not correlated with increased fitness of the antagonist). In this case, \n6 hosts can evolve \u2018antidote\u2019 traits that reduce consequences of damage without \n7 necessarily reducing antagonist fitness (e.g antibody-mediated neutralisation of toxins \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \nin mammals). \n \nTolerance traits increase the probability of transition into mutualism \n \nWe suggest that the type of defence strategy used by an actor may affect the \nprobability of antagonistic interactions switching to mutualism. Resistance and \ntolerance traits have different effects on the encounter rate between actors and \nantagonists, and this will result in different implications for the fitness of antagonist \nindividuals (Roy and Kirchner 2000, Tiffin 2000, Miller and Boots 2005). Reduced \nencounter rates, achieved through resistance traits, make actors less available for \nantagonists, therefore antagonist fitness is often reduced (Strauss and Agrawal 1999). \nThis leads to increased selection pressure on antagonists to locate and encounter \nactors and may also increase virulence. Thus, resistance traits can lead to \ncoevolutionary arms races (Clayton, Lee, Tompkins and Brodie 1999, Strauss and \nAgrawal 1999, Juenger and Lennartsson 2000, Rausher 2001).  \n      Tolerance traits, in contrast, do not reduce the encounter rate between actor and \nantagonist. Their fitness effects on antagonists are often neutral (Rosenthal and \nKotanen 1994, Strauss and Agrawal 1999, Juenger and Lennartsson 2000, Tiffin \n2000), so they do not trigger coevolutionary arms races, which are unlikely to favour \nthe development of mutualism. Furthermore, sometimes tolerance traits may even \nhave positive fitness effects on antagonists, increasing encounter rate, and leading to \nmore stable and persistent interactions (Roy and Kirchner 2000). For example, \nherbivores may have increased performance when feeding on higher nutritive value \nregrowth tissue (Stinchcombe 2002). Such, increased interaction between two groups \nof organisms may increase the chances of a shift towards mutualism. Indeed, \ntheoretical models predicting the requisite conditions for the evolution of mutualism \n 6\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \noften identify the frequency of establishment of interactions (encounter rate) between \nindividuals as an important factor (e.g. Roughgarden 1975, Keeler 1981).  \n      If tolerance defence strategies do indeed increase the probablility of transition into \nmutualism, then it is fitting to ask what factors lead to the adoption of tolerance, rather \nthan resistance, traits? It should be noted at this point that defence strategies need not \nbe dichotomous, based solely on tolerance or resistance. Rather these two strategies \nform the extremes of a continuum. Actual defence strategies may be mixed, involving \nseveral different tolerance and resistance traits. For example, the human immune \nsystem comprises resistance traits such as oily skin to exclude pathogens and T-killer \ncells to destroy invaders, but also tolerance traits in the form of antibody-producing B \ncells that neutralise antigens but do not reduce pathogen load. Trees with modular \nconstruction may also evolve a mosaic of shifting resistance-tolerance to enable \ndifferent parts of their canopy to endure more or less herbivory in turn (Leather 2000). \nWhereabouts a lineage\u2019s defence strategy lies on the resistance- tolerance continuum \nis likely to determine the chances of an antagonistic relationship de-escalating into a \nmutually beneficial one. Further study is warranted in this area, although one possible \nfactor affecting type of defence strategy could be the allocation cost of mounting \ntolerance or resistance traits. The shape of the curve describing the relationship \nbetween resource cost and amount of resistance or tolerance gained is likely to affect \nthe evolution of these traits. Another factor affecting the type of defence strategy is \nthe intensity of the cost on the actor imposed by the antagonist (Restif and Koella \n2004). Very costly, or virulent, antagonists are more likely to select for resistance \ntraits. For example, predators that kill their prey exact the maximum possible cost, \nand it is hard to tolerate being eaten (Dawkins and Krebs 1979)! Conversely, as costs \nfrom the interaction decrease, then selection can favour more tolerance based defence \ntraits. Finally, in mutualistic interactions between co-operator genotypes resistance \ntraits become maladaptive and tolerance traits are the only viable defence strategy. \nThus, as the cost-benefit ratio changes, so does the optimum defence strategy (Fig. 1).  \n      We should clarify here that by \u2018mutualistic interaction\u2019 we refer specifically to \nreciprocally beneficial interactions between co-operating genotypes. These \ninteractions form the basis for \u2018mutualism\u2019 between two species. Mutualisms, \nhowever, are often parasitized by cheats that threaten the stability of the positive \ninteractions between species. We define the interaction between an individual of one \nspecies and a cheating genotype from the second species as an antagonistic \n 7\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \ninteraction, as there are net fitness costs upon the individual of the first species. Thus, \nmutualisms between species contain mainly mutualistic interactions with cooperators \nbut also antagonistic interactions with cheats. Much previous theory has concentrated \non mechanisms by which cooperators of different species maintain coupling through \ntime (e.g. partner choice (Nilson 1988, Bull and Rice 1991, Broughton, Jabbouri and \nPerret 2000, Brouat, Garcia, Andary and McKey 2001), and partner fidelity (Bull and \nRice 1991, Margulis and Fester 1991, Herre 1993, Herre, Knowlton and Mueller \n1999, Bot, Rehner and Boomsma 2001, Thompson 2005)) and by which antagonistic \ninteractions with cheats are limited (e.g. host sanctions and punishment (Trivers 1971, \nAxelrod and Hamilton 1981, Pellmyr and Huth 1994, Johnstone and Bshary 2002, \nHoeksema and Kummel 2003, Kiers, Rousseau, West and Denison 2003, Bshary and \nGrutter 2005, Edwards, Hassall, Sutherland and Yu 2006)). These mechanisms are \nhighly important in preventing the breakdown of mutualisms. We suggest, however, \nthat in addition to these mechanisms tolerance traits may be crucial in a) the formation \nof new mutualisms and, b) maintenance of stability in existing mutualisms by limiting \nany costs imposed by cooperative genotypes, yet while maintaining a net positive \ninteraction. Thus, within a mutualism tolerance traits may be directed towards \ncooperative genotypes, whilst resistance traits are simultaneously directed towards \ncheats. \n \n \n \n \n \n       \nMutualistic interaction Antagonistic interaction\nPredator- prey\nHost- parasite\nPlant- herbivore\nTolerance traits Resistance traits\nCo-operator genotypes in \nmutualism Cheat genotypes in mutualism\n \n \nFig. 1, As the total interaction cost for the actor increases (from mutualism through to weak and then \nvirulent antagonism), there is increased selection to adopt resistance defence strategies. For predator \nprey interactions, resistance traits are the only option. Weakly antagonistic interactions may result in \nboth types of defence trait, while for mutualistic interactions, tolerance traits are the only viable \ndefence strategy.  \n \n \n 8\nTolerance traits increase the stability of mutualisms 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n \nReciprocal positive interactions between species are often transient because there is \nno co-adaptation that couples species in space and time. Similarly, interactions \nbetween species may sometimes be mutually beneficial under certain circumstances \nyet not under others (e.g. parasitic bacteriophages conferring antibiotic resistance to \nbacteria may be beneficial in growth media containing antibiotics (Normark and \nNormark 2002)).  \n      When mutually beneficial interactions are sufficiently stable (lineages of either \nspecies are repeatedly in contact over adequate evolutionary time), then adaptations \ncan arise that faciliate the interaction by increasing the frequency, or maintaining the \nduration of, interspecific encounters. Such mutualistic coevolution increases mutual \nbenefits, but also increases reliance on the partner, as adaptations for mutualism often \nhave allocation costs (Connor 1995), and can reduce the fitness of mutualistic \ngenotypes in environments where the partner is absent (De Mazancourt, Loreau and \nDieckmann 2005). Mutualistic coevolution is thus a positive feedback process, \nincreasing stablility in the interactions between species. The results are the highly \ncoevolved interactions that are used as textbook examples of mutualisms between \nspecies, such as the pollination of fig trees by highly adapted agaonid wasps (Janzen \n1979, Weiblen 2002, Cook and Rasplus 2003). What factors, however, allow transient \npositive interactions to begin this gradual process of coevolution?  \n      We propose that the type of defence strategy used by a species may be very \nimportant in increasing the stability of positive interactions. The consideration of \ndefence strategies for the formation and stability of mutualisms is relevant because \nmany mutualisms have arisen from previously antagonistic interactions (Thompson \n1982, Price 1997, Saikkonen, Faeth, Helander and Sullivan 1998, Jousselin, Rasplus \nand Kjellberg 2001, Westerbergh 2004). Also, as mentioned earlier, even highly \ncoevolved mutualistic interactions have inherent costs that can be minimised using \ndefences. Proximate mutualisms, in which removal of each partner results in a \ndecreased performance of the other (sensu De Mazancourt, Loreau and Dieckmann \n2005), can arise from antagonistic interactions through evolved dependence (e.g. \namoeba becoming dependent on parasitic bacteria for their functioning (Jeon 1972)), \nor through context dependence, such as in antibiotic resistance-conferring phages and \nbacteria (Normark and Normark 2002). When these proximate mutualisms occur, \n 9\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \nresistance traits become maladaptive, because they reduce encounter rate with the \npartner species. Any kind of evasion, deterrence, elimination or exclusion of the \npartner will reduce fitness of the actor, because the interaction is mutualistic and \nreducing encounter with a mutualist is, by definition, maladaptive. Instead, tolerance \ntraits will be selected for to cope with any costs inherent in the interaction. Tolerance \ntraits minimise fitness costs to the actor, but they do so without reducing encounter \nrate, and so without sacrificing the overall benefits achieved from the interaction. This \nadoption of tolerance traits rather than resistance reduces the \u2018pulling apart\u2019 of the \nfocal species, i.e. it reduces the evolution of traits that create asynchrony in space and \ntime between the two species. Instead, synchrony is reinforced and the stability of the \nmutualistic interaction is promoted. Furthermore, whereas resistance traits reduce the \nfitness of the second species, potentially leading to antagonistic coevolutionary arms \nraces, tolerance traits may have neutral or positive fitness effects.  \n      We must stress that this view of the importance of tolerance traits in the stability \nof mutualistic interactions is very provisional and would certainly benefit from further \ninvestigation, such as the quantitative models used to test previous mutualism theory \n(e.g. see Hoeksema and Bruna 2000 for a review). In the next paragraph, we offer an \nexample of how tolerance traits may partially explain a well known mutualism. \n  \n \nAnts and aphids- an example of tolerance traits facilitating a mutualism? \n \nAnts (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) and aphids (Hemiptera: Sternorrhyncha: \nAphidoidea) present an interesting system to consider the emergence of resistance and \ntolerance traits. Ants often tend aphids for honeydew, which they use as a fuel for \nforaging, but sometimes also prey upon aphids when protein is required by the colony. \nPredation is costly, although costs are not as severe as in normal predator- prey \ninteractions because aphids are clonal organisms. Instead, the loss of individual aphids \nis only a partial loss to the aphid colony, which effectively reproduces as one unit. \nAphid colonies benefit through protection from predators, hygienic services, transport \nand shelter and the interaction with ants is often described as an overall mutualism \n(for reviews see:Way 1963, Delabie 2001, Stadler and Dixon 2005).  \n      Ant-tended aphids are often well adapted for the mutualism. Large quantities of \nhigh quality honeydew are produced and retained on the abdomen for ants (Darwin \n 10\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n1859, Banks and Nixon 1958, Del-Claro and Oliveira 1993). Conversely, aphids that \nare not ant-attended often retain defences such as evasion behaviour or deterrent traits \n(Buckley 1987, Suzuki and Ide 2008, Tokunaga and Suzuki 2008). These different \nadaptive strategies either increase or decrease encounter rates with ants and it appears \nthat tolerance and resistance type strategies respectively are being used. This is \nexplained in more detail below. \n \nIn ant-tended aphids, honeydew quantity (Banks and Nixon 1958, Takeda, Kinomura \nand Sakurai 1982, Del-Claro and Oliveira 1993), and quality (Yao, Shibao and \nAkimoto 2000, Fischer and Shingleton 2001, Yao and Akimoto 2002), is actively \nincreased in the presence of ants. Production of low volumes, or low quality \nhoneydew leads to increased predation by ants, rather than tending (Edinger 1985, \nSakata 1995, Sakata 1999, Fischer, Hoffman and Wolfgang 2001). This conditional \npredatory behaviour by ants could be viewed as a form of punishment, which \npromotes stability in mutualisms (Pellmyr and Huth 1994, Kiers, Rousseau, West and \nDenison 2003, Bshary and Grutter 2005, Edwards, Hassall, Sutherland and Yu 2006). \nPunishment behaviour by ants alone, however, is only half the story. Aphids must \nrespond to such punishment, and they often appear to do so by modifying honeydew \nquality to minimise costs of predation.  \n      Predation by ants is an important cost of the interaction for aphids (Way 1963, \nOffenberg 2001) and, thus, modifying honeydew serves as a means to decrease the \ncost of the interaction for an aphid colony. Increased honeydew quality effectively \ndistracts ants from predating aphids, by increasing their relative value to ants as a \nrenewable honeydew source rather than as prey items. There are likely to be costs of \nmodifying honeydew (Fischer and Shingleton 2001, Yao and Akimoto 2001), just as \nall defence traits have allocation costs (e.g. Strauss, Rudgers, Lau and Irwin 2002). If \nthe benefits of distracting ant predation more than offset these costs, however, than \nthe strategy is feasible. Indeed a number of aphid species appear able to modify \nhoneydew composition (Fischer and Shingleton 2001). Considering the effect this \nmodification of honeydew has on the encounter rate between the aphid colony and the \nants, there will clearly not be a reduction in encounter rate. Indeed, the recruitment of \nant foragers is positively correlated with the value of a food source (Bonser, Wright, \nBament and Chukwu 1998, Katayama and Suzuki 2003, Mailleux, Deneuborg and \nDetrain 2003, Portha, Deneuborg and Detrain 2004), and high quality honeydew-\n 11\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \nproducing aphids attract more ants per aphid (Fischer, Hoffman and Wolfgang 2001, \nFischer, Volkl  and Hoffman 2005). Thus, phenotypic plasticity of honeydew \nproduction in aphids is a trait that reduces the overall cost of interacting with ants i.e. \na \u2018defence\u2019 trait. Furthermore, the reduced interaction cost is achieved without a \nreduction in overall encounter rate. Therefore we can describe it as a tolerance rather \nthan a resistance trait.  \n       \nIn contrast to the tolerance defence strategies described above, non ant-tended aphids \nmay resist encounters with ants by using resistance traits. Such traits are well \ndocumented and include evasion behaviour, e.g. dropping from the plant triggered by \nalarm pheromones (Roitberg and Myers 1978, Arakaki 1989, Losey and Denno 1998, \nSuzuki and Ide 2008) or increased alate production (Kunert, Otto, R\u00f6se, Gershenzon \nand Weisser 2005, Mondor, Rosenheim and Addicott 2005). Alternatively, aphids \nmay employ deterrence traits, e.g. waxy coverings, hard sclerotized cuticles, cornicle \nsecretions, aphid toxicity or kicking behaviour (Buckley 1987, Bristow 1991, Dixon \n1998).  \n     Overall, if ant attendance is not beneficial for aphid species, it is likely that they \nwill evolve traits to minimise ant attendance. Such traits are resistance traits. In \ncontrast, aphids which do benefit in some part may be selected for tolerance traits. \nAfter this initial selection for a particular defence strategy, evolutionary trajectories \nwill split, with divergence reinforced through positive feedback processes; resistance \ntraits intensify coevolutionary arms races, while tolerance traits facilitate stable \nmutualistic coevolution. Ecological factors may determine the initial direction of \nsplitting (see Stadler and Dixon 2005, for explanations of ant-attendance), yet once an \nevolutionary pathway is commenced upon, the type of defence strategy, resistance of \ntolerance, will be important in reinforcing the trajectory through positive feedback \nprocesses. As such, tolerance traits such as plasticity in honeydew production may \nfacilitate the  mutualism between ants and aphids. In the absence of tolerance traits, \naphids would be unable to reduce the costs inherent in the interaction without using \nresistance. Such resistance would reduce selection for continued mutualistic co-\nadaptation, thereby reducing the stability of the interaction. \n \n \n \n 12\nConclusion 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n \nTo summarise, we have proposed the idea that defence traits may be important in \nmaintaining stability in mutualistic interactions. Tolerance traits allow the costs \ninherent in an interaction to be minimised, whilst still allowing the overall interaction \nto be maintained. In contrast, resistance traits act to reduce synchrony in space and \ntime with a partner lineage. Thus, the type of defence strategy used by a species may \naffect the likelihood of transition of an interaction into mutualism, as well as \npromoting stability within mutualisms. Phenotypic plasticity of honeydew production \nby aphids could be an example of how tolerance traits can facilitate mutualistic \ninteractions. Many factors, such as aphid physiology and ant nutritional requirements, \ndetermine the initial coevolutionary trajectory of an interaction, but positive feedback \nin defence traits can lead to further divergence.  \n      Whilst resistance traits promote escalating arms races, tolerance traits may pave \nthe way for mutualistic coevolution. Indeed, the adoption of tolerance traits may be \none of the primary mechanisms in the formation of persistent cooperative interactions \nbetween species. Differences in tolerance between species have been shown to \ninfluence community structure (Stowe, Marquis, Hochwender and Simms 2000) and \nthis may be even more so if tolerance traits lead to mutualisms which fundamentally \nshape communities (Christian 2001, Stachowicz 2001, Gomulkiewicz, Nuismer and \nThompson 2003, Hay, Parker, Burkepile, Caudill, Wilson, Hallinan and Chequer \n2004). We should highlight that this theory is very provisional and would benefit from \nfurther theoretical work investigating the evolution of tolerance; for example, by \nconsidering which factors promote tolerance over resistance strategies. Immediate \ncandidates are the direct allocation costs of traits and also the cost of interacting with \nantagonists, with costly interactions selecting for resistance based strategies. To \nsummarise, the study of tolerance has previously been restricted to antagonistic \ninteractions. We suggest that broadening our consideration of tolerance defences to \nencompass mutualistic interactions will allow a better understanding of species \ninteractions. \n \n \n \n \n 13\nAcknowledgements 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n \nWe thank Lars R\u00e5berg, Mark Rausher, Tony Dixon, Douglas Yu, Clare de \nMazancourt, journal editors and an anonymous reviewer for helpful discussion and \ncomments which have led to improvement of this manuscript.\n 14\n 15\n \nArakaki, N. 1989.
