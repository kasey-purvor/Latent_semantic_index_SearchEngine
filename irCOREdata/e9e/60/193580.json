Furthermore, the yeast-to-hypha switch has been implicated in the virulence of this organism. The class C vps (vacuolar protein sorting) mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are defective in multiple protein delivery pathways to the vacuole and prevacuole compartment. In this study C. albicans homologues of the S. cerevisiae class C VPS genes have been identified. Deletion of a C. albicans VPS11 homologue resulted in a number of phenotypes that closely resemble those of the class C vps mutants of S. cerevisiae, including the absence of a vacuolar compartment.

Palmer,1,2* Annette Cashmore,1 and Joy Sturtevant2\nDepartment of Genetics, University of Leicester, Leicester, United Kingdom, LE1 7RH,1 and Department of Microbiology,\nImmunology, and Parasitology, LSUHSC School of Medicine, and Center of Excellence in Oral and\nCraniofacial Biology, New Orleans, Louisiana 701192\nReceived 21 October 2002\/Accepted 14 February 2003\nThe Candida albicans vacuole has previously been observed to undergo rapid expansion during the emergence\nof a germ tube from a yeast cell, to occupy the majority of the parent yeast cell. Furthermore, the yeast-to-hypha\nswitch has been implicated in the virulence of this organism. The class C vps (vacuolar protein sorting)\nmutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are defective in multiple protein delivery pathways to the vacuole and\nprevacuole compartment. In this study C. albicans homologues of the S. cerevisiae class C VPS genes have been\nidentified. Deletion of a C. albicans VPS11 homologue resulted in a number of phenotypes that closely resemble\nthose of the class C vps mutants of S. cerevisiae, including the absence of a vacuolar compartment. The C.\nalbicans vps11\u0001 mutant also had much-reduced secreted lipase and aspartyl protease activities. Furthermore,\nvps11\u0001 strains were defective in yeast-hypha morphogenesis. Upon serum induction of filamentous growth,\nmutants showed delayed emergence of germ tubes, had a reduced apical extension rate compared to those of\ncontrol strains, and were unable to form mature hyphae. These results suggest that Vps11p-mediated traf-\nficking steps are necessary to support the rapid emergence and extension of the germ tube from the parent\nyeast cell.\nThe fungal vacuole is an acidic, membrane-bound compart-\nment containing a variety of hydrolytic enzymes. The functions\nof the fungal vacuole have been well defined for model fungi\nsuch as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus nidulans.\nThese include degradation of cellular proteins for the recycling\nof amino acids and storage of cellular metabolites such as\namino acids, phosphate, and metal ions (25). A functional\nvacuole is necessary for cytoplasmic homeostasis, and several\nS. cerevisiae mutants lacking an intact vacuole are sensitive to\nexternal pH and osmotic pressure (4). Regulated uptake and\nrelease of stored nutrients by the vacuole also help to maintain\nstable nutrient concentrations within the cytoplasm (24, 31).\nWhile the vacuoles\u2019 functions are not essential for vegetative\ngrowth, they are of increased importance, and often essential,\nfor survival during periods of stress such as starvation or\ngrowth at elevated temperatures (4, 45). In addition, the vac-\nuole may play a central role during processes of differentiation;\nfor example, S. cerevisiae mutants defective in vacuolar hydro-\nlase activity are unable to undergo the process of sporulation\n(51). This suggests that the vacuole may function in adaptation\nto new environments.\nTo date little has been reported about the specific functions\nof the vacuole in pathogenic species. It was postulated that the\nvacuole is likely to play a key role during adaptation of a\npathogenic fungus to different host environments. Further-\nmore, vacuolar functions may be required for processes of\ncellular differentiation. An intensively studied example of such\na differentiation process is the yeast-hypha transition in the\nfungal pathogen Candida albicans, which has been strongly\nimplicated in the pathogenicity of this organism (10). Previous\nwork by Gow and Gooday (20) studied the morphology of the C.\nalbicans vacuole through the yeast-hypha transition. It was ob-\nserved that germ tube emergence is accompanied by a rapid\nincrease in vacuolar volume (20). The rapid expansion of the\nvacuole coincides with migration of parental cytoplasmic material\ninto the hyphal tip. As the germ tube extends, subapical compart-\nments can also be identified; these are composed almost entirely\nof vacuole and contain little protoplasm, whereas the protoplasm\nmigrates with the hyphal tip. After a delay period of apparent\ninactivity, the highly vacuolated compartments regenerate cyto-\nplasm and the vacuoles recede. Formation of secondary germ\ntubes from mother cells or of branches from subapical compart-\nments occurs only after cytoplasmic regeneration, when the cyto-\nplasm again migrates into the newly synthesized hyphal tip, leav-\ning behind a highly vacuolated parent cell. At present the\nmechanism by which vacuole expansion occurs during germ tube\nformation and its regulation remain obscure. However, one major\nadvantage of this mechanism may be that it requires minimal\namounts of de novo cytoplasmic biosynthesis while allowing C.\nalbicans to germinate rapidly and explore its environment or for-\nage for nutrients under limiting conditions. Such a developmental\nmodel is unusual in filamentous fungi, and this mechanism may\nbe unique to C. albicans.\nMore than 40 S. cerevisiae vacuolar protein sorting (vps)\nmutants, which missort the vacuolar hydrolase carboxypepti-\ndase Y (CPY) to the cell surface, have been identified (3, 35,\n36, 37). The corresponding protein products define compo-\nnents required for the delivery of vacuolar hydrolases from the\nGolgi apparatus to the vacuole. The class C vps mutants, vps11\n(pep5), vps16, vps18 (pep3), and vps33, exhibit the most severe\nphenotypic defects of all vps mutants (3, 35). The class C VPS\n* Corresponding author.

These proteins are required for the\ndelivery of proteins to the vacuole from the Golgi apparatus,\nfrom the cell surface via endocytosis, from the cytoplasm via\nthe cytoplasm-to-vacuole trafficking route, and through auto-\nphagy (32, 35, 49). The class C Vps complex mediates the\ndocking of transport vesicles with the vacuolar membrane\nthrough the regulation of vacuolar t-SNARE (target soluble\nN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein recep-\ntors) (Vam3p and Vam7p) and transport vesicle vehicular (v)-\nSNARE (Vti1p) interaction, to form the trans-SNARE com-\nplex (40), a critical step leading to membrane fusion.\nFurthermore, it has been shown that Vps11p interacts with\nVps39p, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ypt7p, a\nRab GTPase that mediates the initial \u201ctethering\u201d of vesicle and\ntarget membranes (50). Thus, the Class C Vps complex has an\nessential function in coordinating the vesicle fusion machinery\nat the vacuolar surface.\nIn addition, Vps11p and Vps18p have been shown to function\nat earlier steps in the CPY and endocytotic delivery pathways\n(42). Woolford et al. (49) uncovered a genetic interaction be-\ntween VPS11 and VPS8, a gene known to have functions in the\nrecycling transport step from the prevacuole compartment (PVC)\nto the Golgi apparatus. This was later supported by analysis of\nvps11 and vps18 temperature-sensitive mutant strains (42). Syn-\nthetic interactions were also observed between vps11ts and vps18ts\nalleles and genes known to function in Golgi-to-PVC transport,\nincluding PEP12 and PEP7 (42), which encode an endosomal\nt-SNARE and SNARE regulator, respectively. The same study\nrevealed that VPS18 function was required for endocytotic trans-\nport from the cell surface to the PVC. As such, deletion of the\nclass C VPS genes results in a range of secondary phenotypes,\nincluding the missorting of multiple vacuolar hydrolases as inac-\ntive precursors, an inability to grow at 37\u00b0C, and sensitivity to\nosmotic stress (4, 5, 14, 30, 42). The class C mutants also show\nreduced activity of Kex2p (34), an endopeptidase localized to a\ntrans-Golgi compartment, which proteolytically cleaves secreted\npeptides such as the \u0002-factor precursor (17). Class C vps mutants\nlack a recognizable vacuole compartment and instead accumulate\na range of different-sized vesicles, presumed to be transport in-\ntermediates destined for the vacuole (4, 32). In summary, both\nVps11p and Vps18p function at multiple steps in vesicle-mediated\ntransport to the vacuole and are essential for vacuolar biogenesis.\nSince this project was undertaken, a C. albicans strain with a\ndeletion of a vps gene (C. albicans VPS34) was reported as de-\nfective in filamentation (8). This supports the hypothesis that vps\ntrafficking pathways may be required for filamentation.\nThe aims of this study were, first, to generate a C. albicans\nmutant strain defective in vacuolar protein delivery pathways\nand vacuole biogenesis and, second, to assess how germ tube\nemergence is affected by these defects.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nStrains.

EUKARYOT. CELL\nand 11D3 [Table 2]) for disruption were designed so that each primer contained\n20 bp homologous to PCR disruption plasmids flanked with 70 bp of sequence to\ndirect homologous integration into the VPS11 open reading frame (ORF). The\nprimer set was used in PCR amplifications with plasmids pRS-ARG\u0003SpeI and\npGEM-URA3. Two nanograms of plasmid DNA was amplified with forward and\nreverse primers, each at a 1 \u0004M concentration, by using Life Technologies Taq\npolymerase and reagents according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions or by using\nReady-To-Go PCR Beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Amplification con-\nditions were as follows: 94\u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s,\n52\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min\/kb, with a final step of 72\u00b0C for 10 min. The\nresulting vps11::ARG4 and vps11::URA3 PCR products consist of a 5\u0005 targeting\nsequence (\u000117 to \u000187 nucleotides [nt] from the ATG start site of VPS11) and a\n3\u0005 targeting sequence (\u00013233 to \u00013302 nt), separated by either the ARG4 or the\nURA3 marker. The vps11::ARG4 product was transformed into BWP17 to gen-\nerate four heterozygous strains, GPS1 to GPS4. Strains GPS1 to -4 were trans-\nformed with vps11::URA3 to generate three vps11::ARG4\/vps11::URA3 double-\nknockout strains, GPD1 to GPD3. Arg\u0001 and Arg\u0001 Ura\u0001 transformants were\nscreened for the correct integration event by Southern hybridization using the\nVPS11-specific probe excised from plasmid pGP115. VPS11 revertant strains\nwere constructed by reintroducing a copy of VPS11 into the his1 locus of the null\nstrain GPD1. Plasmids pGEM-HIS1 and pGH11 were linearized at the unique\nNruI site in the HIS1 flanking sequences to target integration into the his1 locus\nof the vps11\u0003 double-mutant strain GPD1. GPD1 was transformed with linear-\nized pGH11 (GPR1 to GPR3) or linearized pGEM-HIS1 (GPH1 to GPH3).\nIntegration of these plasmids at his1 was confirmed by PCR using a primer\nflanking the his1 locus (HIS3AMP [Table 2]) combined with either a primer\nwithin the VPS11 insert sequences (11HISR [Table 2]) or a primer within the\npGEM-HIS1 sequences (GEMHISR [Table 2]). Multiple isolates for each con-\nstructed strain were subject to phenotypic analysis. As expected, no phenotypic\ndifferences were observed for any given genotype.\nMedia and growth conditions. Strains were routinely grown on yeast extract-\npeptone-dextrose (YPD) supplemented with uridine (50 \u0004g\/ml) (YPD \u0001 uri) at\n30\u00b0C. Minimal medium (yeast nitrogen base [YNB]) was supplemented with the\nappropriate auxotrophic requirements as described for S. cerevisiae (9) except for\nuridine (50 \u0004g\/ml). The yeast-to-hypha transition was induced in either liquid or\nsolid (inclusion of 2% agar) medium. The transition medium was either M199\nmedium containing Earle\u2019s salts and glutamine (Invitrogen), buffered with 150 mM\nHEPES and adjusted to pH 7.5, or 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) in YPD. Filamen-\ntation in liquid media was induced by inoculating 2 \u0006 106 to 5 \u0006 106 cells\/ml and\nincubating at 37\u00b0C with shaking (200 rpm). For solid surfaces, 5 \u0006 105 cells in 5 \u0004l\nof water were spotted onto plates and incubated for 2 to 5 days at 37\u00b0C.\nThe growth of vps11\u0003 double-knockout, heterozygous, and revertant strains\nwas compared with that of the parental strain, BWP17, and the prototrophic\nstrain, YJB6284, under a range of growth conditions described below. Strains\nwere grown overnight in YPD \u0001 uri at 30\u00b0C, pelleted, and resuspended in sterile\ndistilled water at 1 \u0006 107, 2 \u0006 106, 4 \u0006 105, or 8 \u0006 104 cells\/ml. Each cell\nsuspension was then transferred to a 96-well plate and applied to a solid test agar\nby using a sterile multipronged applicator. To test temperature sensitivity, cells\nwere plated onto YPD \u0001 uri agar and incubated at 30, 37, or 42\u00b0C. To test\nosmotic sensitivity, cells were plated onto YPD \u0001 uri agar supplemented with\neither 1 M NaCl or 2.5 M glycerol and were incubated at 30\u00b0C.\nPlasmids. The plasmids used for templates in PCR amplifications, pGEM-\nHIS1, pRS-ARG\u0003SpeI, and pGEM-URA3, were kindly provided by Aaron\nMitchell (Columbia University) (48). The VPS11 ORF, including 338 nt of\nupstream promoter and 201 nt of downstream 3\u0005 sequence, was PCR amplified\nfrom C. albicans strain BWP17 genomic DNA with primers 11R5 and 11R3\n(Table 2), and the 3.8-kb product was ligated into pGEM-TEasy (Promega) to\nproduce plasmid pGP11. Plasmid pGP11 was digested with BamHI, and the\nVPS11 insert was ligated into the BamHI site of pGEM-HIS1 to form pGH11. A\nplasmid containing the 5\u0005 upstream region of VPS11 was constructed by PCR\namplification from C. albicans BWP17 genomic DNA with primers 11PB5 (nt\n\u0007413 to \u0007393 from the ATG start codon) and 11PB3 (nt \u000710 to \u000730) (Table 2).\nThe PCR product was ligated into pGEM-TEasy to yield plasmid pGP115.\nDNA manipulations and sequence analysis. Plasmid isolation and enzymatic\nreactions were performed either by standard methods (38) or according to the\nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions. Bacterial transformations were performed using\nchemically competent Escherichia coli DH5\u0002 (Invitrogen). Genomic DNA from\nC. albicans was isolated using glass beads (9). Southern blot analysis was per-\nformed as previously described (43). Probes were radiolabeled on purified plas-\nmid inserts with [\u0002-32P]dCTP by using Ready-To-Go DNA Labeling Beads\n(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). DNA sequences of selected clones were deter-\nmined by the Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Laboratory at the University\nof Leicester (Leicester, United Kingdom). Sequence data were analyzed by using\nthe University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (GCG) sequence analysis\nsoftware programs (13). Nucleotide database searches were performed using\nBLAST (1). PCR was performed under routine conditions unless otherwise\ndescribed. The sequences of oligonucleotides used in PCR amplifications are\nlisted in Table 2. Putative protein sequences were analyzed in BLAST searches\nand with other programs including GCG (13) and PSORT2 (http:\/\/bioweb\n.pasteur.fr\/seqanal\/interfaces\/psort2.html).\nIsolation of C. albicans VPS11 and VPS18. Incomplete VPS11- and VPS18-like\nORF sequences were identified on the C. albicans sequence database (http:\n\/\/alces.med.umn.edu\/candida.html) through BLAST searches using the S. cerevi-\nsiae VPS11 and VPS18 ORF sequences. Oligonucleotides were designed for the\nspecific amplification of these C. albicans sequences (CAEND1 and CAEND2\nfor VPS11; CAPEP31 and CAPEP32 for VPS18 [Table 2]) from C. albicans strain\nS\/01 genomic DNA, by PCR. This produced a 393-nt VPS11 fragment and a\n607-nt VPS18 fragment, which were used as probes for the isolation of complete\ngene sequences. VPS11 and VPS18 were isolated from a C. albicans strain S\/01\ngenomic DNA library cloned into the S. cerevisiae plasmid vector YEp213 (kindly\nprovided by P. Meacock, University of Leicester). This library was maintained in E.\ncoli (strain DH5\u0002), and 8,000 individual clones were screened by colony hybridiza-\ntion with C. albicans VPS11- and VPS18-specific probes by using routine procedures\n(38). Plasmid DNA was isolated from each \u201cpositive\u201d clone and used as template\nDNA in PCR amplifications using primer set CAEND1\u2013CAEND2 or CAPEP31\u2013\nCAPEP32 to confirm the presence of C. albicans VPS11- or VPS18-specific se-\nquences, respectively. The inserts of selected clones were then sequenced.\nNorthern blot analysis. Cells grown at 30\u00b0C overnight in YPD \u0001 uri were\nsubcultured at 5 \u0006 106 cells\/ml into 50 ml of fresh YPD \u0001 uri and incubated at\n30\u00b0C with shaking for 5 h. RNA was then isolated from each culture by using\nglass beads and phenol (39). Ten to 30 \u0004g of total RNA was loaded per lane and\nelectrophoresed in formaldehyde gels containing morpholinepropanesulfonic\nacid (MOPS) (38). Gels were blotted and hybridized as described for Southern\nblot analysis (43). A 2-kb DNA fragment internal to the VPS11 ORF was excised\nwith SpeI from pGP11, radiolabeled with [\u0002-32P]dCTP, and used as a specific\nVPS11 probe. The C. albicans actin gene was used as an RNA integrity and\nloading control probe. In this case a 2-kb SalI internal fragment was isolated\nfrom pPAC5 (kindly provided by W.A. Fonzi, Georgetown University).\nEnzyme assays. Secreted aspartyl proteinase (SAP) activity was induced in\nliquid culture with 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a nitrogen source and\nwas assayed on agar containing BSA as described by Crandall and Edwards (12).\nSecreted lipase activity was detected on egg yolk-containing agar as described by\nFu et al. (16). In both assays an opaque ring around the colony is indicative of\nsecreted enzymatic activity. A second test for secreted lipase activity was growth\non YNB agar containing 2.5% Tween 20 as a carbon source. CPY activity was\nquantified by a method modified from the work of Jones (22). The CPY-specific\nsubstrate N-benzoyl-L-tyrosine p-nitroanilide (NTPNA) was diluted 1:5 from a\n2.5-mg\/ml stock solution in dimethyl formamide with 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5).\nA 190-\u0004l volume of assay buffer was added to the wells of a microtiter plate, and\n5 \u0006 107 cells suspended in 10 \u0004l of sterile distilled H2O were added to each well.\nAssay plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C before absorbance at 405 nm was measured\nat 5 and 20 h. Controls with cells but no NTPNA were also measured, and these\nvalues were subtracted from those for reactions with NTPNA. Each experiment\nwas performed in triplicate, and statistical analysis was performed using the t test.\nData are given as mean A405 \b standard deviation.\nVacuolar morphology. The vacuolar marker dye 5- (and 6-) carboxy-2\u0005,7\u0005-\ndichlorofluorescein diacetate (carboxy-DCFDA; Molecular Probes, Inc.) was\nused to visualize vacuolar morphology according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruc-\ntions. Cells grown at 30\u00b0C overnight in liquid YPD medium were harvested and\nresuspended at 106\/ml in 50 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 5, containing 2%\nglucose. Carboxy-DCFDA was then added to a final concentration of 10 \u0004M\nfrom a 10 mM stock (made in dimethyl formamide) and incubated at 30\u00b0C for 15\nmin. Stained cells were then applied to polylysine-coated slides and examined\nusing a confocal fluorescence microscope. As a control for organelle integrity,\nnuclei were also stained with the specific dye 4\u0005,6\u0005-diamidino-2-phenylindole\n(DAPI), as described by Burke et al. (9).\nRESULTS\nIdentification of C. albicans class C VPS genes. Initial at-\ntempts to isolate C. albicans class C VPS homologues through\nthe functional complementation of the four S. cerevisiae class C\nvps mutants were unsuccessful. BLAST searches of the C.\nalbicans sequence database (http:\/\/alces.med.umn.edu\/gbsearch\nVOL. 2, 2003 CANDIDA ALBICANS vps MUTANT 413\n\/ybc.html) using the S. cerevisiae class C VPS ORFs as a query\nsequence identified sequences with homology to VPS11,\nVPS18, and VPS33. These were used as query sequences in\nfurther BLAST searches to identify overlapping sequences,\nand contigs were constructed from the available data for each\nof the ORFs identified. However, at this time the database-\nderived contigs spanned only short regions of each of these\nORFs. From the available sequence data, oligonucleotides\nwere designed for specific amplification of each of the VPS11-,\nVPS18-, and VPS33-like ORF fragments by PCR. Then the\nproducts of these amplifications were used to probe a C. albi-\ncans genomic DNA library. This led to the identification of C.\nalbicans genomic clones encoding VPS11 and VPS18 homo-\nlogues. Sequencing of these clones revealed the entire C. albi-\ncans VPS11 and VPS18 ORFs (accession numbers AJ492193\nand AJ289080, respectively).\nThe C. albicans VPS11 ORF encodes an 1,100-amino-acid\nprotein that shares 35% identity and 48% similarity with\nVps11p of S. cerevisiae. The VPS18-like ORF encodes a pro-\ntein of 810 amino acids, sharing 31% identity and 45% simi-\nlarity with its S. cerevisiae homologue. A putative cysteine-rich\nRING (really interesting new gene) domain has been identified\nin the C-terminal regions of both S. cerevisiae Vps11p and\nVps18p (7, 14, 30, 34), and it is likely that these mediate\nprotein-protein interactions to form large complexes. Site-di-\nrected mutagenesis has demonstrated that at least the first\ncysteine residue of the proposed Vps18p motif is required for\nnormal function (34). Notably, many of the cysteine and histi-\ndine residues of the previously proposed RING domain were\nconserved in the C. albicans homologues (Fig. 1). The putative\nC. albicans VPS11 gene product is predicted to possess a CX2\nCX12CXHX2HX2CX43CX2C sequence near its C terminus.\nSimilarly, the putative C. albicans protein Vps18p has a CX2\nCX14CXHX2HX2CX5CX2C sequence near its C terminus.\nBoth of these sequences conform to the H2 type RING domain\nconsensus CX2CX9-39HX1-3HX2-3CX2C4-48CX2C (7). Neither\nprotein is predicted to have transmembrane domains or N-\nterminal signal peptides, suggesting that they do not enter the\nsecretory pathway, and likely reside in the cytoplasm. A pos-\nsible vacuolar targeting motif was identified at amino acid 418\nof Vps11p (KLPN), but given the lack of a signal peptide for\nendoplasmic reticulum translocation, this is unlikely to be of\nimportance. Lupas\u2019s algorithm (26) detected heptad repeats\nlikely to form \u0002-helices within residues 530 to 558 of Vps11p\nand 722 to 750 of Vps18p, which through interaction with other\nsimilar motifs may participate in the formation of coiled-coil\nstructures (41). S. cerevisiae Vps11p is predicted to form a\nsimilar helical region (residues 850 to 914), while S. cerevisiae\nVps18p is not. The functional significance of the S. cerevisiae\nVps11p heptad repeat has not yet been reported, but it may\nmediate protein-protein interactions. Similar helical domains\npresent on v- and t-SNAREs are known to mediate the tight\ninteraction of these proteins through the formation of coiled-\ncoils in the trans-SNARE complex (46). Through interaction\nwith similar structures on v- and t-SNAREs, the heptad repeats\npresent on Vps11p and Vps18p may regulate the formation of\ntrans-SNARE complexes and thereby regulate vesicle\u2013target\nmembrane fusion.\nMore recently, the sequences of ORFs with homology to all\nfour class C VPS genes have been made available through the\nC. albicans genome sequencing project (http:\/\/www-sequence\n.stanford.edu\/group\/candida).\nConstruction of C. albicans vps11\u0001 mutant. The PCR-based\ngene disruption method described by Mitchell and colleagues\n(48) was utilized for construction of a vps11\u0003 null strain as\ndescribed in Materials and Methods. Correct integration of\neither marker at the VPS11 chromosomal locus should result in\nthe deletion of 3,144 bp of the 3,300-bp ORF (Fig. 2A). Ini-\ntially the ARG4 cassette was transformed into the BWP17\nrecipient strain (arg4\u0003\/arg4\u0003 his1\u0003\/his1\u0003 ura3\u0003\/ura3\u0003), and\nArg\u0001 transformants were screened by Southern blot hybridiza-\ntion for the desired integration event by using a VPS11-specific\nprobe (Fig. 2B). VPS11\/vps11\u0003::ARG4 \u201csingle mutants\u201d (GPS1\nto GPS4) were then transformed with the vps11::URA3 cas-\nsette, and Arg\u0001 Ura\u0001 transformants were screened for a sec-\nond integration event, resulting in vps11\u0003::ARG4\/vps11\u0003::\nURA3 \u201cdouble mutants\u201d (GPD1 to GPD3) (Fig. 2B).\nIn order to confirm that the loss of VPS11 function was\nresponsible for any observed phenotypes, a \u201cwild-type\u201d copy of\nVPS11 was reintroduced into the his1 locus of the double\nmutant GPD1 on plasmid pGEM-HIS1 to form revertant\nstrains GPR1 to GPR3. Plasmid control strains were also con-\nstructed by transforming GPD1 with linearized pGEM-HIS1,\ngenerating strains GPH1 to GPH3.\nRNA prepared from strains BWP17, GPS1, GPD1 and -2,\nGPR1 to -3, GPH1 to -3, and YJB6284 (a prototroph derived\nFIG. 1.

C-terminal sequences from S. cerevisiae and C. albicans\nVps11p proteins (A) and from S. cerevisiae and C. albicans Vps18p proteins (B) were aligned using MultAlin (11). A series of cysteine and histidine\nresidues (highlighted on a solid background) which conform to the H2 type RING consensus sequence are conserved in both sets of homologues.\nOther conserved residues are highlighted on a shaded background. Amino acid residue numbers are given at each end of the sequences.\n414 PALMER ET AL. EUKARYOT. CELL\nfrom BWP17) was subjected to Northern blot analysis with a\nVPS11-specific probe (Fig. 2C). This resulted in the detection\nof two low-abundance transcripts of approximately 3.6 and 3.0\nkb in the parental strain BWP17 (Fig. 2C, leftmost lane) and\nthe prototrophic control strain YJB6284 (Fig. 2C, rightmost\nlane). The 3.0-kb band comigrated with the larger rRNA spe-\ncies and may result from \u201ctrapping\u201d of the VPS11 transcript in\nthe rRNA. It is unlikely that the second transcript is the prod-\nuct of a second VPS11 homologue, since neither transcript was\ndetected in our vps11\u0003 strains. The same species were detected\nin the heterozygous strain GPS1 (data not shown) and in each\nof three revertant strains (GPR1, GPR2, and GPR3) (Fig. 2C).\nAs expected, this transcript was not detected in the null strains\nGPD1 and -2 (data not shown) and GPH1 to -3 (Fig. 2C), even\nwhen a threefold increase in RNA was probed (30 \u0004g instead\nof 10 \u0004g).\nDeletion of C. albicans VPS11 causes defects in vacuole func-\ntion and biogenesis. C. albicans strains with deletions in both\nVPS11 alleles grew significantly more slowly than parental\nstrains (the generation time was approximately twice that of\nthe parental strain) under all conditions tested. Furthermore,\nthe mutant was more heterogeneous in cell size, with approx-\nimately one-third of cells appearing oversized when grown in\nYPD broth at 30\u00b0C. In contrast, when grown in the less-rich\nYNB medium, mutant cells were smaller than Vps11\u0001 cells.\nInitially the C. albicans vps11\u0003 mutant strains were exam-\nined for phenotypes indicative of defective vacuole function.\nThe double mutants exhibited an inability to grow on YPD\nagar supplemented with 2.5 M glycerol or 1 M NaCl2 (Fig. 3),\nindicating sensitivity to osmotic stress. The VPS11 null mutant\nwas also sensitive to growth on YNB medium supplemented\nwith 400 \u0004M CuSO4 (data not shown), consistent with defects\nin metal ion homeostasis. The parental and heterozygous\nstrains grew well at either 30 or 37\u00b0C and grew less abundantly\nat 42\u00b0C. However, while the double mutant grew well at either\n30 or 37\u00b0C, it was completely unable to grow at 42\u00b0C (Fig. 3).\nEach of these phenotypes closely resembles those of the S.\ncerevisiae class C vps mutants (4, 5, 28, 30), with the exception\nthat the S. cerevisiae mutants are sensitive to growth at 37\u00b0C\nrather than 42\u00b0C. Furthermore, each phenotype was fully com-\nplemented by the reintroduction of a wild-type copy of VPS11\n(GPR1 to -3) but not by that of the pGEM-HIS1 vector alone\n(GPH1 to -3) (Fig. 3). These observed phenotypes are consis-\ntent with defects in multiple vacuolar functions.\nThe S. cerevisiae class C vps mutants are defective in the\ndelivery, processing, and activity of several vacuolar hydrolases\nincluding CPY (21, 35). CPY activity was assayed to provide an\nindication of vacuolar hydrolase function in the C. albicans\nvps11\u0003mutant. The vps11\u0003mutant, GPH1, showed a threefold\nreduction in CPY activity (0.189 \b 0.057 [mean A405 \b stan-\ndard deviation]) compared to the prototrophic control strain\nYJB6284 (0.618 \b 0.105; P \t 0.01). The revertant, GPR1,\nshowed restored CPY activity and actually had higher levels of\nCPY activity (1.126 \b 0.163) than YJB6284.\nThe vacuole morphology of the prototrophic strains\nYJB6284, GPR1, and GPH1 was determined by using carboxy-\nDCFDA (Molecular Probes, Inc), a fluorescent dye which spe-\ncifically accumulates within the vacuole (33). The control strain\nYJB6284 had typical wild-type vacuole morphology, with one\nto three well-defined, brightly stained subcellular compart-\nFIG. 2. Deletion of C. albicans VPS11.

The parental strain, BWP17 (VPS11\/VPS11), is shown in the\nleftmost lane. (C) RNA isolated from cells grown to log phase (1\u0006 107\nto 2 \u0006 107 cells\/ml) in YPD medium was subjected to Northern blot\nanalysis using a VPS11-specific probe. Two low-abundance RNA spe-\ncies of approximately 3.0 and 3.6 kb were detected in each of the\nparent strain (BWP17), the prototrophic control strain (YJB6284), and\nthree revertant strains (GPR1 to -3). No VPS11 transcript was detected\nin the double-mutant strains GPH1 to -3. The blot was stripped and\nreprobed for the actin transcript as a loading and RNA integrity\ncontrol.\nVOL. 2, 2003 CANDIDA ALBICANS vps MUTANT 415\nments (Fig. 4A). The revertant strain GPR1 exhibited a stain-\ning pattern indistinguishable from that of the control strain,\nindicating a normal vacuole morphology (Fig. 4C). However,\nthe double mutant GPH1 did not localize the fluorophore to\nany distinct subcellular compartment (Fig. 4B), instead exhib-\niting staining of a lower intensity dispersed throughout the cell.\nThis diffuse staining pattern confirms the absence of an intact\nvacuole in the C. albicans vps11\u0003 mutant. A normal nucleus\nmorphology was observed for each strain by DAPI staining\n(data not shown), indicating that nuclear structure is unaf-\nfected in the vps11\u0003 mutant.\nThe C. albicans vps11 mutant has reduced secreted protein-\nase and lipase activities. S. cerevisiae vps11 and vps18 mutants\nare defective in Kex2p-mediated maturation of the mating\npheromone \u0002-factor (34). In C. albicans the Kex2p endopep-\ntidase is required for the maturation and full activity of SAP\n(27). A C. albicans kex2 mutant strain has been described as\nhaving reduced SAP activity and furthermore is defective in\nyeast-hypha morphogenesis (27). We therefore examined SAP\nactivity in our C. albicans vps11\u0003 mutant as an indicator of\nKex2p activity by observing BSA hydrolysis at the peripheries\nof colonies grown on solid BSA-plus-yeast extract agar. Colo-\nnies of the prototrophic control (YJB6284) and revertant\n(GPR1) strains had large opaque zones at their peripheries,\nindicating SAP-mediated BSA hydrolysis (Fig. 5A). The dou-\nble mutant (GPH1) had no visible opaque zone, indicating a\nloss of SAP activity (Fig. 5A). The reduction in SAP activity\nwas much more severe than that for the C. albicans kex2 mu-\ntant (27); thus, loss of Kex2p activity alone cannot account for\nthe SAP defects in GPH1. This suggests that there are either\ndifferent or additional defects in the processing or secretion of\nSAP in GPH1. C. albicans is also known to secrete a number of\nlipase enzymes (16). As a further marker of secretion, secreted\nlipase activity was assessed on egg yolk medium. The absence\nof a white precipitation zone around strain GPH1 (Fig. 5B) is\nindicative of little or no secreted lipase activity in the vps11\u0003\nmutant. The revertant GPR1 had opaque zones of a size sim-\nilar to that of the YJB6284 zones (Fig. 5B). Reduced secreted\nlipase activity was confirmed by the severely retarded growth of\nthe vps11\u0003 mutant on YNB medium containing Tween 20 as a\ncarbon source (data not shown).\nThe C. albicans VPS11 null mutant is defective in the yeast-\nhypha switch. The vps11\u0003 strain was examined for defects in\nmorphogenesis under both solid agar and liquid inducing con-\nditions. Mutant strains GPD1 and -2 and GPH1 to -3 failed to\nfilament on either M199 (Fig. 6A) or 10% FCS (data not\nshown) solid medium at 37\u00b0C, conditions which resulted in\nextensive filamentation of the parental strain (BWP17), con-\ntrol strain (YJB6284), and revertant strains (GPR1 to -3) (Fig.\n6A).\nYeast-hypha morphogenesis was next examined in liquid\nculture. Each strain was grown to saturation in YPD medium\nat 30\u00b0C, then subcultured into fresh YPD supplemented with\n10% (vol\/vol) FCS, and incubated at 37\u00b0C to induce filamen-\ntation. Under these conditions the majority of both the control\n(YJB6284) and revertant (GPR1) cells rapidly formed germ\ntubes, clearly visible after 60 min (Fig. 6B). By 120 min, the\nmajority of germ tubes had elongated to form parallel walled\nhyphae with some branches. Some pseudohyphae were also\nobserved (Fig. 6B). In contrast, few cells of the double-mutant\nstrain GPH1 were observed to form true germ tubes after 60 or\neven 120 min of serum induction (Fig. 6B). A proportion of\nGPH1 cells were observed in elongated forms, but many of\nthese elongated forms had visible constrictions along the cell\nwall (Fig. 6B), characteristic of pseudohyphal growth, or else\nFIG. 3. The C. albicans vps11\u0003 mutant is sensitive to osmotic and\ntemperature stress. Serial dilutions of strains BWP17 (VPS11\/VPS11),\nGPS1 (VPS11\/vps11\u0003), GPD1 (vps11\u0003\/vps11\u0003), GPR1 (vps11\u0003\/vps11\u0003\/\nVPS11), GPR2 (vps11\u0003\/vps11\u0003\/VPS11), GPH1 (vps11\u0003\/vps11\u0003), GPH2\n(vps11\u0003\/vps11\u0003), and YJB6284 (VPS11\/VPS11) were spotted onto\nYPD \u0001 uri agar and incubated as described in Materials and Methods.\nCell suspensions were also spotted onto YPD\u0001 uri agar supplemented\nwith either 2.5 M glycerol or 1 M NaCl2 and incubated at 30\u00b0C.\n416 PALMER ET AL.

Of the true germ tubes that were present, none were\nobserved of more than two or three cell compartments in\nlength, even after 18 h. By 180 min, YJB6284 and GPR1\nhyphae had begun to aggregate and form clumps that were\nvisible to the naked eye at 240 min. In contrast, no clumping\nwas observed in the GPH1 culture, even after 18 h of growth in\nserum culture.\nThus, upon serum induction of filamentous growth, only a\nsmall proportion (\t10%) of cells of the C. albicans vps11\u0003\nmutant strain were able to produce true germ tubes. In addi-\ntion, there was a significant delay in the emergence of theseg-\nerm tubes, which had a reduced apical extension rate com-\npared to those of parental and revertant strains. Finally, the\nmutant cells were unable to sustain filamentous growth to form\nmature hyphae.\nFIG. 4. C. albicans VPS11 is involved in vacuole biogenesis.

As ex-\npected, the C. albicans vps11\u0003 mutant lacked normal vacuole\nmorphology and exhibited a diffuse staining pattern with the\nvacuole-specific dye carboxy-DCFDA. This contrasts with the\nFIG. 6. C. albicans VPS11 is required for normal filamentation. (A) Cell suspensions of BWP17 (VPS11\/VPS11), GPH1 (vps11\u0003\/vps11\u0003), GPR1\n(vps11\u0003\/vps11\u0003\/VPS11), and YJB6284 (prototrophic control strain) were spotted onto M199 agar medium and incubated at 37\u00b0C to induce\nfilamentation. After 4 days, BWP17, YJB6284, and GPR1 all had well defined filamentous borders. No filamentous border was observed for the\ndouble mutant GPH1. (B) Prototrophic strains YJB6284, GPH1, and GPR1 grown in YPD medium were subcultured to YPD medium with 10%\n(vol\/vol) fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37\u00b0C to induce filamentation.\n418 PALMER ET AL. EUKARYOT. CELL\nS. cerevisiae class C vps mutants, which produce a punctate\nstaining pattern with similar dyes (30, 44). This could be due to\na difference either in the actual morphology of these mutants\nor in the ability of carboxy-DCFDA to localize to small vesicles\nin C. albicans.\nSeveral possibilities exist to explain the retarded filamenta-\ntion in vps11\u0003mutants. Firstly, the vacuole has previously been\nobserved to undergo rapid expansion upon serum-induced\nmorphogenesis (20). The S. cerevisiae class C VPS gene prod-\nucts form a complex required for the docking and fusion of\nmultiple transport intermediates with the vacuolar membrane\n(32). During filamentation in C. albicans, the rapid increase in\nvacuolar volume must result from a net gain of membranous\nmaterial at the vacuole membrane. The incorporation of new\nmembrane material at the vacuole membrane during expan-\nsion may well depend on the putative fusion machinery en-\ncoded by the class C VPS homologues identified in this study.\nTherefore, in addition to maintaining the structural integrity of\nthe vacuole in the yeast form, the C. albicans class C homo-\nlogues may be required to facilitate vacuolar expansion upon\nhyphal induction. In agreement with this hypothesis, during\ninitial studies of C. albicans VPS18, it was found that transcript\nexpression increased severalfold following induction of hyphal\ngrowth in serum culture (28). It is possible that this expansion\nfulfills a physical requirement, perhaps to aid the rapid exten-\nsion of the germ tube. The vacuolar expansion observed upon\ngerm tube emergence may reduce or at least delay the require-\nment for cytoplasmic biosynthesis while supporting the rapid\nemergence of the germ tube. An ability to undergo this tran-\nsition quickly, even under nutrient-poor conditions, may be\nadvantageous to C. albicans, permitting a quick response to\nconditions that favor filamentous growth. It has also been\nsuggested that the rapid transition from yeast to hyphal growth\ntriggered upon phagocytosis can result in lysis of the host\nphagocyte (2) and may represent a mechanism of escape from\nthe host\u2019s defense.\nSecondly, S. cerevisiae Vps11p and Vps18p are known to\nfunction at multiple transport steps in vacuolar protein deliv-\nery (42), and loss of these proteins\u2019 activities results in defects\nin multiple PVC and vacuolar functions. It is likely that the C.\nalbicans homologues described here operate at equivalent\nsteps in this organism. Thus, a further possibility is that a\nspecific function of the vacuole and\/or PVC, rather than their\nphysical expansion, is required for filamentation. The C. albi-\ncans vps11\u0003 strain described in this study was defective in a\nrange of vacuolar functions that resulted in temperature and\nosmotic sensitivity. S. cerevisiae class C vps mutants are also\nknown to be defective in the processing of multiple vacuolar\nhydrolases and to missort these hydrolases as inactive precur-\nsors (35). Vacuolar hydrolase activity is essential for the pro-\ncess of sporulation in S. cerevisiae (51), an example of cellular\ndifferentiation. It therefore remains possible that it is the re-\nduced hydrolase activity of C. albicans vps11\u0003 strains rather\nthan a lack of vacuolar expansion which accounts for the yeast-\nhypha differentiation defects. This explanation of the defects\nobserved in the Candida vps11\u0003 mutant is less favored by us,\nmainly because the yeast-hypha transition is a very rapid pro-\ncess in C. albicans, whereas the degradation mediated by the\nvacuolar hydrolases during sporulation and autophagy in S.\ncerevisiae occurs much more slowly, over many hours (15).\nThirdly, S. cerevisiae vps11 and vps18 mutants are also de-\nfective in Kex2p-dependent maturation of \u0002-factor (34). Kex2p\nis an endopeptidase localized to a trans-Golgi compartment\n(17, 23). Ordinarily it transits to the PVC via the CPY trans-\nport pathway before returning to the Golgi apparatus in a\nretrograde transport step (29). Due to the transport defects in\nthe vps11 and vps18 mutants, Kex2p is unlikely to be returned\nto the Golgi apparatus, resulting in depletion of Kex2p activity\nin the trans-Golgi compartment (47). The loss of SAP activity\nin our C. albicans vps11\u0003mutant could be due in part to similar\ndefects in Kex2p function. This is of particular interest in light\nof the fact that a C. albicans kex2\u0003 mutant has been reported\nas defective in hyphal formation (27). Thus, the filamentation\ndefects of our vps11\u0003 mutant could result from a depletion of\nKex2p activity in the trans-Golgi compartment. More gener-\nally, the function of the Golgi \u201cdonor\u201d may be perturbed or\ncompromised in our vps11\u0003 mutant due to the absence of a\nPVC or vacuole \u201crecipient\u201d compartment.\nAdditional studies are required to elucidate which of the\npossibilities discussed above accounts for the morphogenesis\ndefects observed in our vps11\u0003 mutant. At present it is not\nclear which of the Vps11p-mediated trafficking steps are re-\nquired for filamentation. The construction of C. albicans mu-\ntants defective in individual transport steps to the vacuole will\nbegin to identify which transport steps, and by inference which\ncompartment functions, are required for filamentation.\nSomewhat unexpectedly, the C. albicans vps11\u0003 mutant ex-\nhibited very little or no SAP activity in the BSA plate assay.\nThis defect was more severe than that of a kex2\u0003 mutant (27),\nso it is unlikely to be accounted for by Kex2p function alone.\nThis could suggest a defect in either SAP biosynthesis or se-\ncretion. A similar loss of secreted lipase activity was also dem-\nonstrated on egg yolk medium. The almost total loss of these\nactivities could be caused by defects in the secretory pathway\nfrom Golgi apparatus to cell surface. The secretory pathway of\nS. cerevisiae vps11 mutants is apparently unaffected, as judged\nby invertase and \u0002-factor secretion as well as CPY mislocal-\nization to the cell surface (34, 35, 37). This may indicate that C.\nalbicans Vps11p functions as part of a general fusion complex\nrequired for multiple delivery pathways from the Golgi appa-\nratus. Alternatively, the SAP and lipase defects may be a sec-\nondary consequence of the absence of a vacuolar compart-\nment. This may result in the mislocalization of proteolytic\nenzymes to the cell surface, as is the case for S. cerevisiae vps11\nmutants (35), potentially causing degradation of secreted pro-\nteins. However, further investigation is required to determine\nthe cause of the SAP and lipase defects.\nThe importance of vacuolar inheritance during hyphal de-\nvelopment has been the subject of a separate investigation (C.\nBarelle, R. Mathias, C. Gaillardin, N. Gow, and A. Brown,\nAbstr. Yeast Gen. Mol. Biol. Meet., abstr. 103, 2000). A C.\nalbicans vac8\u0003 mutant was constructed and shown to be de-\nfective in vacuole inheritance. Surprisingly, this has little effect\non germ tube formation or extension rate but results in an\nincrease in branching frequency. Although these mutants do\nnot inherit vacuolar material from the parent cell, after a short\ndelay they are able to generate a new vacuole compartment.\nThese results suggest that vacuole protein-sorting pathways,\nrather than inheritance, are important during the yeast-hypha\nswitch.\nVOL. 2, 2003 CANDIDA ALBICANS vps MUTANT 419\nThe observations made by Gow and Gooday (19) raise sev-\neral important questions. First, from where is the extra mem-\nbrane derived which is incorporated into the vacuole during\ngermination? Is there a \u201creservoir\u201d of membrane vesicles that\nfuse to the vacuole upon hyphal induction, or is membrane\nmaterial derived from other membrane-bound organelles such\nas the PVC, Golgi apparatus, or endoplasmic reticulum? How\nis this process of vacuolar expansion regulated? This may\nprove more difficult to investigate and may be resolved only\nwith further elucidation of the signal transduction pathways\nthat regulate morphogenesis. While the present study was in\nprogress, it was reported in the literature that a C. albicans\nVPS34 homologue had been disrupted (8). The Candida\nvps34\u0003 mutant is phenotypically very similar to the vps11\u0003\nstrain described here. The vps34\u0003 strain is hypersensitive to\ntemperature and osmotic stress, it shows delayed emergence of\ngerm tubes, and only a small proportion of cells form true germ\ntubes in response to serum induction (8). However, there are\nseveral differences between the vps34\u0003 mutant and the vps11\u0003\nmutant analyzed in this study. First, it was not reported if the\nvps34\u0003 strain has a reduced germ tube extension rate. Also, no\ndefects in CPY, SAP, or secreted lipase activity were reported.\nMoreover, while the vps11-deficient strain lacks a central vac-\nuole, the vps34-null strain has a grossly enlarged vacuole, oc-\ncupying approximately 80% of cell volume (8). The C. albicans\nvps34\u0003 mutant is predicted to have defects in anterograde and\nretrograde traffic between the Golgi apparatus and the vacu-\nole. Thus, upon induction of hyphal growth, it is predicted that\nthe vacuole would neither expand nor contract. This may ac-\ncount for the observed defects in filamentous growth. The\nsimilarities between the C. albicans vps34\u0003 and vps11\u0003 mu-\ntants could suggest that it is not just the presence of a vacuole\nbut the trafficking pathways to the vacuole that are important\nfor morphogenesis. It is likely that these pathways mediate\nvacuole expansion, which may be required for germination\n(19).\nThe results of this study demonstrate that one or more of the\ntrafficking steps mediated by Vps11p are required for normal\nfilamentation in the pathogen C. albicans. However, further\ninvestigation is required to identify which of the transportation\nsteps affected in our vps11\u0003 mutant accounts for the defect in\nfilamentous growth.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe work at Leicester University was supported through a BBSRC\npostgraduate studentship.
