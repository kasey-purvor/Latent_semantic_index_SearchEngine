Building on the resource-\nbased view (RBV) of the firm and conscious of the difficulty in establishing causality\nwith performance, the concept of dynamic capability has emerged as a primary construct\nfor explaining how firms can improve efficiency and effectiveness and lay the\nfoundations of competitive advantage (Teece et al., 1997; Zollo and Winter, 2002; Helfat\nand Peteraf, 2003; Bowman and Ambrosini, 2003; Ethiraj et al., 2005; Helfat et al., 2007;\nTeece, 2007; Sirmon et al., 2007; Ambrosini et al., 2009; Easterby-Smith et al., 2009).\nAdopting more of a process approach than existing RBV concepts, dynamic capabilities\nare the bridge between firm resources and business context, focusing on how firms can\ncreate best practice, if not industry or market advantage, through the reconfiguration,\nintegration and deployment of competencies in conditions of market change (Ambrosini\net al., 2009). As such, dynamic capabilities can constitute the underpinnings of\ncompetitive advantage in rapidly changing environments (Teece, 2007). Although not\nexclusive in earlier definitions, the focus of most research has been on \u2018market\u2019 change.\nA number of scholars have suggested that firm resources can be cross-fertilized into a\nnonmarket environment, in particular to the corporate political context (Baysinger and\nWoodman, 1982; Baysinger, 1984; McWlliams et al., 2002; Bonardi et al., 2006; Frynas\net al., 2006; Oliver and Holzinger, 2008; Capron and Chatain, 2008). However, the\ncriticism of some of these studies from the political focal lens is that they are not paying\nattention to the managerial coordinative activities by which firms assemble and leverage\nknowledge assets in given policy environments.\n5The aim of this study is to examine how lobbying capabilities are designed by\nboth state and non-state owned European airlines, and more importantly their senior\nmanagement in uncertain, unpredictable policy contexts. In other words, we seek to\nunderstand how Europe\u2019s long established network carriers (so called \u2018legacy\u2019 airlines)\ndesign their lobbying capabilities to influence European and national institutions and\nrelated agents during the 2001-2005 timeframe. We argue that a lobbying capability is a\nhigh level capability that most firms have embedded in their practices as a basis for\ncompetitive advantage, but we aim to explicate the dynamics and interactions between its\nmicro foundations (Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000; Bonardi et al., 2006; Oliver and\nHolzinger, 2008).\nFollowing the typical format of inductive research, our paper addresses the\ncriticism of neglecting managerial coordinative activities, business-government relations\nand the given context (Hillman et al., 2004; McWilliams et al., 2002). It contributes to\nthe current academic debate in RBV by providing empirical evidence on design choices\nin corporate lobbying activities that is contextualized in a given policy environment.\nBuilding on previous studies that highlight how firms appropriate value through\ninfluencing policy (Hillman and Hitt, 1999), we argue that lobbying capabilities are a set\nof specific and identifiable strategic and operational processes that are used by firms to\nleverage political resources in the nonmarket environment. The findings of politically\nactive airlines demonstrate how ownership structures and uncertainty moderate strategic\nchoices in capability design.\n6THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS\nFirms engage in both market and nonmarket strategies to create shareholder value\n(Baron, 1995, 2001). Whereas market strategies involve decisions such as product\npositioning and pricing, nonmarket strategies are actions taken by the firm in its political,\nregulatory, and social environments for the purpose of increasing or defending firm value\n(Baron, 1997). Political behavior includes such company activities as lobbying a\nlegislator or regulator, litigating a case in court, and making campaign contributions. Two\naspects to understanding lobbying activities are: first, how much lobbying behavior\ncorporations are likely to undertake; and second, whether lobbying will be undertaken\nfrom inside a firm or externally using professional lobbyists or trade associations within\nthe industry sphere. These questions are important as they relate to both corporate\nstrategy and the boundaries of the firm. Put another way, an inquiry into senior\nmanagers\u2019 choice in designing their internal or external lobbying capabilities will\ndemonstrate that under conditions of uncertainty, managers must make judgments about\nthe correct course of action (Peteraf and Reed, 2007).\nLobbying capabilities and their value to firms is acknowledged in international\nbusiness and strategic management literature (Baysinger et al., 1985; Getz, 1997;\nBoddewyn and Brewer, 1994; Hillman and Hitt, 1999; Henisz and Zelner, 2003). It has\npreconditions for influencing decision shaping and decision making (Coen, 1998). Keillor\net al. (2005) suggesting that firms involved in using their lobbying capabilities have three\nmotives for engaging in political behavior: domain advantage, domain defense and\ndomain maintenance. The implied reason for engaging in political behavior can be a\ndesire to pursue the firm\u2019s private interest (i.e. domain advantage), to manage public\npolicy that might be at odds with the firm\u2019s strategic goals (i.e. domain defense), or to\n7influence public policy that might threaten the means by which a firm achieves it goals\n(i.e. domain maintenance). A variety of political behaviors can be used to accomplish the\nfirm\u2019s overall objective of dealing with political issues. These include business-\ngovernment relations, political inducements and contributions and, in this study, overt\nlobbying (Baysinger and Woodman, 1982; De Figueiredo and Tiller, 2001; Henisz and\nZelner, 2003; Hillman et al., 2004). The resulting benefits to the firm can include\nreduced environmental uncertainty, reduced transaction costs, and increased long-term\nsustainability (Hillman et al., 1999). Governments represent major sources of uncertainty\nfor firms because they often control critical resources and opportunities that shape\nindustry and competitive environments (Jacobson et al., 1993; Baron, 1995). As a result,\nmany firms engage in lobbying strategies: proactive or reactive actions to affect the\npublic policy environment in a way favorable to the firm (Baysinger, 1984).\nPrevious studies have shown that dynamic capabilities can take a variety of forms\nsuch as pricing capabilities (Dutta et al., 2003) or entrepreneurial capabilities (Karra et\nal., 2008). We take the view that lobbying capabilities have been used by large\norganizations within a wide range of industries to create change or align with change.\nThese industries include oil and gas (Frynas et al., 2006), electronics (Yoffie and\nBergenstein, 1985; Lawton, 1996) and air transport (Brown, 1987; Lawton, 1999).\nLobbying capabilities are rendered dynamic when they align with nonmarket change.\nThey are viewed to be high-level, strategic capabilities instead of merely operation\ncapabilities (Bonardi et al., 2006). Drawing on Teece et al. (1997), Eisenhardt and\nMartin (2000) and Bonardi et al. (2006), we describe lobbying capabilities as:\n8As noted above, we introduce the concept of lobbying capabilities to understand how\nsenior managers design their lobbying capabilities using strategic decisions to influence\ngovernment for the compensation package post 9\/11. Some researchers have shown that\nlobbying can occur through internal or external paths as they both use the capacity of\nfirms to leverage skills and resources so as to successfully manage and influence the\npublic policy process (Oliver and Holzinger, 2008). They are specific to the jurisdiction\nin which the firm operates and allow the firm to configure lobbying strategies to fit the\ncontext of a particular situation (Bonardi et al., 2006). These include the networks of\nrelationships between corporate employees and national and local political, regulatory,\nlegal, and interest group actors who influence or determine public policy. However, what\nis not understood in previous studies is how lobbying is designed between state and non-\nstate owned companies (Cuervo and Villalonga, 2000; Dewenter and Malatesta, 2001),\nespecially in the airline industry.\nInternal and external lobbying capabilities\nTo examine how lobbying design processes vary between state and non-state owned\nairlines, we first need to make a distinction between internal (unilateral) and external\n(multilateral) approaches. In doing so we are challenging the contention that state-owned\ncarriers tend to rely on internal capabilities, leveraging influence through direct interface\nCorporate political processes, specifically the ways in which a company\u2019s senior and\nacting representatives work together to reconfigure and leverage political resources\nthat an organization uses to respond to or even create nonmarket change. Lobbying\ncapabilities are thus the organizational procedures by which senior representatives or\nacting representatives achieve resource configurations that enable the company to\nadapt to or even anticipate shifts in the corporate political environment.\n9with national government agents and agencies. Non-state owned carriers combine this\napproach with external capabilities exerted through their influence within trade\nassociations and airline networks and the occasional and usually targeted use of contract\nlobbyists. Existing research on lobbying tends to focus on the amount and type of\nlobbying that occurs. It has largely omitted the organizational options, combinations and\nmechanisms firms have for lobbying, i.e. the action of lobbying from a corporate\nperspective. Since the seminal work of Olson (1965), economics and management\nresearch has focused on the ability of individuals and groups to overcome the free-rider\nproblem in creating collective action (Sandler and Tschirhart, 1980; Bendor and\nMookherjee, 1987). Whilst the collective action literature has much to say about the\namount of lobbying that occurs, all these studies are less informative when it comes to the\ndesign choice of lobbying capabilities (Hillman et al., 1999). The state of scholarly\nknowledge about lobbying capabilities and how they are combined remains scant when\ncompared with research on strategies for the marketplace (Brown, 1997).\nFew scholars view lobbying capabilities as both internal and external to the firm\nbut both can still be embedded in the strategic architecture of the firm (Oliver and\nHolzinger, 2008). The internal approach refers to lobbying individually while external\nlobbying refers to corporate political action using trade associations or through contract\nlobbyists. Furthermore, these arrangements of internal and external lobbying capabilities\nin Europe respond differently to different environments (Kyrou, 2000). But those\nlobbying capabilities considered in this paper leveraged on both internal and external\npolitical resources. These political resources are embedded in trade associations, contract\nlobbyist, lawyers and in-house government affairs departments (De Figueiredo and Tiller,\n2001).\n10\nManagerial choices, political resources and the policy context\nWith this array of political resources available to airline companies, why were certain\noptions pursued exclusively or primarily in specific policy contexts? It is at this juncture\nthat we consider managerial choice and resultant actions. The senior managers choices\nand their focused strategic action are important topics to be looked at in understanding\nthe design of dynamic capabilities (Peteraf and Reed, 2007; Pandza and Thorpe, 2009;\nAmbrosini et al., 2009). The idea of senior management exercising lobbying action in a\nconcerted fashion to manage its political environment is not recent. Fainsod (1940)\nsuggested that an industry obtains a favorable regulation by its capacity to mobilize three\nkinds of resources: financial (political campaign financing), human (the use of lobbyist\nand lawyers) and political (political coalition-building). The notion of senior\nmanagement assembling specific resources and skills was also mentioned by Leone\n(1977) and Peteraf and Reed (2007), while Yoffie and Bergenstein (1985) spoke of the\naccumulation by firms of relationship capital. Within the political science literature, the\nnotion of relationship resources that create capabilities has been suggested, but the theory\non managerial choices is underdeveloped and empirical evidence has some shortcomings\n(Dehan, 2005).\nDesigning lobbying capabilities require management interventions. Some studies\nhave found that in specific regulatory contexts, the impact of a policy will be unequal\nacross different firms (Coen, 1997, 1998). Firms with differing resource bases to manage\ntheir political environment will have different responses to expectations about\nprofitability and investments in political situations (Oliver and Holzinger, 2008). Given\nthe incremental nature of capability design, firms that seek to design superior capabilities\n11\nas the basis of sustainable competitive advantages must prevent the overall coherence of\ntheir capability design efforts from being eroded (Helfat and Peteraf, 2003). Somewhat\nparadoxically, this makes the choice of lobbying actions an important factor to consider\nin different environmental context types. Lockett et al., (2009) have critically highlighted\nthat dynamic RBV tends to focus on consequences of firm heterogeneity but more\nscholarly attention needs to be devoted to capability and resource functionality and\ndesign. Together, these gaps lead to the first research question of this study. How do the\nsenior managers of European airlines design lobbying capabilities in unpredictable policy\ncontexts?\nHenisz and Delios (2004) argue that two types of environmental uncertainty exist:\none predicated on lack of information about a particular environment and the other\narising due to a change in that environment. Their research examines foreign direct\ninvestment decisions in the context of environmental uncertainty in host countries.\nBuilding on the Henisz and Delios (2004) definition, our study is framed by\nenvironmental uncertainty resulting from what we term predictable and unpredictable\npolicy contexts. The predictable context is one in which the firm expects to be confronted\nby policy decisions, stakeholders, issues or actions within a nonmarket political system,\ne.g. the onset of market deregulation (Kim and Prescott, 2005). As a result, the firm must\nproactively react to this unanticipated policy context. Our study focuses on the less\ncertain, unpredictable policy context. Building on Brink (2004) and Oliver and Holzinger\n(2008), we define our chosen unpredictable policy context as:\n12\nThe chosen context in this investigation is one in which unpredictable policy outcomes\ncame about as a result of events post the September 11th 2001 (hereafter 9\/11) terrorist\nattacks in the United States (U.S.). The attacks had significant impact on both U.S. and\ninternational airlines. Within this context, European airlines that operated transatlantic\nservices came to learn quickly that sustaining their competitive positions was reliant on\neffective lobbying of the European Commission and national governments. This was to\nsecure compensation to support their growing debts, exacerbated by a fall in demand and\nextra costs associated with new government security policies (Tarry, 2005; Bonham et\nal., 2006). If airline firms did not lobby, they risked receiving less aid and consequently\nundermining their market positions. The compensation package stimulus was where\nairlines wanted European governments or the European Commission to compensate them\nfor the loss in revenues caused by the grounding of their fleets in the U.S. immediately\nafter the 9\/11 attacks.\nIn this paper we consider the relative importance of managerial choices in\ndesigning lobbying capabilities. This enables us to understand the degree to which\nlobbying capabilities are configured in conjunction with the unpredictable policy context.\nWe also focus on the role of a senior management team\u2019s strategic focus, or what some\nscholars call management choices (Peteraf and Reed, 2007), in designing lobbying\ncapabilities so as to understand the components and interactions of resources. Finally, we\nconcentrate on the interconnectivity between lobbying capability and an organization\u2019s\nAn unpredictable policy context is where the firm is unexpectedly confronted\nby policy decisions, stakeholders, issues or actions within a political system.\nAs a result, the firm must react to this policy context.\n13\nunpredictable policy context. From the gaps highlighted above we arrive at our second\nresearch question. Are there any specific patterns of strategic action associated with the\ndesign of lobbying capabilities in state versus non-state airlines?\nMETHODOLOGY\nThis study used a qualitative methodology, specifically a multi-case design which\nsupports theory replication logic whereby a set of cases is treated as a series of\nexperiments, each serving to confirm or disconfirm a set of concepts (Yin, 1999). As a\nresult, these concepts begin to uncover complex processes of capability construction but\nespecially indicate promising future iterations of data collection and analysis. In this\nstudy our primary unit of analysis is how lobbying capabilities are designed in the airline\nindustry.\nSampling. The choice of this industry - and specifically European long haul\ncarriers - is largely due to its degree of politicization. The European airline industry has\nbeen fraught with politics and governmental interference since its inception and airlines\nhave had to battle with the politics of regulation and deregulation, both domestically and\ninternationally (Brown, 1987; Staniland, 2003). We identified several firms that met our\ninitial criteria of: (a) operating scheduled transatlantic services; (b) having a significant\nhistorical perspective (i.e. were not recent start-ups); and (c) making statements in press\nreleases or via the media that they were in the process of reconfiguring some important\naspect of their lobbying activities. We contacted all these firms (state and private owned)\nand subsequently selected five (Table I), based on willingness to provide interview access\nto their political affairs managers.\n14\nTake in Table I\nData Sources. We asked political affairs managers and directors what lobbying actions\nthey employed in response to the 9\/11 attacks and their responses shaped our research\nphenomenon. We posed key questions to all our respondents around the strategic\nresponses undertaken in organizing their internal and external capabilities to create\ninfluence. Furthermore, we asked them to highlight which resources and processes were\nperceived to be important during these challenging times. Finally, we asked them if they\nwere using existing capabilities or developing new capabilities.\nData was collected through in-depth, semi-structured interviews and documented\narchival data between 2001 and 2005. We interviewed the directors, presidents and\nmanagers of Political, Government, Aeropolitical, and Public Affairs, as well as members\nof the top management team at the next level of the hierarchy who were responsible for\nthe areas targeted for lobbying development during the chosen policy context and period.\nWe also interviewed industry experts to enhance validity. We conducted in total 42\ninterviews, ranging in duration from 50 to 90 minute telephone and in-person interviews.\nAll interviews were recorded and transcribed in English. Several hundred pages of\ndocuments involving lobbying activities during this period were available for most\nairlines. Access to the lobbying documents provided extremely detailed descriptions of\nselected lobbying processes, as confirmed by key informants.\n15\nANALYSIS AND FINDINGS\nThe preponderance of dynamic capabilities literature tends to describe the specific\ncapabilities of an organization as homogenous and separate from management judgment\n(Bowman and Ambrosini, 2003). In contrast to this common view, our study of micro-\nprocesses that embody lobbying capabilities revealed variations in enactments of\nlobbying capability design. Our analysis allows a fine-grained interpretation of how\nmanagerial choices in designing lobbying capabilities used both internal and external\nmeans and resource configurations (human, network and organizational). However, these\ndesign choices and logics had some performance consequences across the five case\nstudies.\nLobbying capability design patterns\nOur empirical evidence derived from each case individually led to two important\nfindings. First, each of the strategic choices taken by private or state owned airlines\ndistinctively affected the design characteristics associated with the senior management\u2019s\nchoices in lobbying action (Schwenk, 1988). High levels of focused senior management\naction led to design variations in the lobbying capabilities that was proactively controlled\nin private owned airlines, but less so compared to state owned airlines. One important\naspect of these controlled strategic actions was that sense giving by senior management\ntended to occur in an organized, systematic fashion, rather than ad hoc (Schwenk, 1988):\nfocused management priorities were dominated by scheduled meetings, formal\ncommittees, and planned action with restricted attendance, rather than by informal\nmeetings. Strategic action occurred in this controlled way because senior management\n16\ndrew on their formal authority to design their lobbying capabilities in order to influence\nto receive a compensation package for the grounding of their planes.\nA second key aspect of controlled strategic actions was that a significant amount\nof focused approach occurred in private airlines between policy makers and senior\nmanagement, rather than the loose approach taken by the more state owned airlines that\nused mainly trade associations to lobby for the compensation package. Senior\nmanagement from private owned airlines leveraged key resources available to them \u2013\nnamely human and network - from the onset of 9\/11, to defend their financial position so\nthat they could influence policy makers for the compensation package.\nThe strength of the evidence and whether or not management action was focused\non specific political resources did actually explain differing designs in lobbying\ncapabilities between private and state. We had not originally expected the design patterns\nto exhibit such divergent pathways. Nevertheless, our non-state and state airlines - both\nstrongly supported by scientific evidence but displaying very different design outcomes -\nrepresented such polar cases. The evidence for this will be unfolded in the next sections.\nChoosing between internal and external lobbying capabilities\nAll five airlines were not found to be lobbying the U.S. government at any time for\ncompensation package rising from 9\/11, as it was viewed to be the less effective route\naccording to managerial choices. We found that senior management teams took decisions\nto design a lobbying capability by shifting the focus from the national level to the\ninternational - or supranational - European Union (EU) level, as time played a vital role\nin decision-making. There was a crossover in lobbying between the national and\ninternational targets, as airlines started to talk to their own governments first, followed by\n17\nEU level government members, but then realized that the Association of European\nAirlines (AEA) was the fastest route to create influence.\nThe internal and external capabilities were used to leverage on three specific\npolitical resource types, as shown in Table II. Our analysis indicates that political\nresources used by European long haul airlines in the post 9\/11 unpredictable context were\ncomprised of mainly human and organizational resources. But physical resources were\noften replaced or superceded by another resource. Most of our respondents repeated the\nwords \u2018network resources\u2019, as being crucial to developing a lobbying capability.\nTherefore, we conceptualize political resources as being comprised of three subdivisions:\nhuman and organizational as Barney (1991) noted but with the addition of network\nresources (Granovetter, 1973).\nTake in Table II\nFrom the cross case analysis, we found a combination of internal and external capabilities\nthat were used to leverage on political resources in the unpredictable policy context to\ncreate influence. But in private owned airlines, the management priority at the start was\non using internal lobbying capabilities to leverage political resources, compared to state\nowned airlines that used more external capabilities. We came to learn that eventually\nboth airline types used mainly the AEA to lobby post 9\/11 because they had less time to\nmaneuver in this unpredictable period. It was believed that the airlines wanted to\nleverage their external relationships but did not have time to do so. Furthermore, as most\nairlines had similar problems, they believed that the AEA (being a strong external\n18\nnetwork resource) would have more influence then a single route approach. As one\ninformant from a private owned airline put it:\nFrom the in depth cross case analysis of the evidence, we found political resources to be\nleveraged, reconfigured and deployed using internal capabilities (e.g. sending emails,\nformal letter writing, talking to friends from within the firm) and external capabilities\n(e.g. Using AEA to email and organize various important meetings). Moreover, we found\nthat strategic actions involved structural investments, human capital investments and\nnetwork relationship investments in the design of the lobbying capabilities. However, at\na micro level, internal or external lobbying capabilities were used differently between the\nprivate and state owned airlines.\nThe role of management choice in designing lobbying capabilities\nOur data suggest at the core of lobbying capability design were the approaches of\nindividual political affairs managers. These people played an important role in\ndeveloping the content of lobbying process. It reflects the interaction between\nmanagement and its environment and it also shows how an organization manages this\nrelationship (Simon, 1947; Ginsberg, 1988; Walsh, 1995; Gavetti, 2005). Our research\nsuggests that learning by doing is one part of the process in order to make sense of\nlobbying context and content (Thomas et al., 1993; Chang, 1995; Anand and Khanna,\nWe were using a combination of lobbying processes. These routines were the same\nas the ones used in other issues but in greater frequency and different combinations.\nThe routines were used to influence our governments and EU level political actors.\nThis was an extraordinary event so we used a mix of capabilities that we believed\nwould create positive influence. These combinations are not a strict recipe but more\ndependent on what our owners have in mind.\n19\n2000). Prior work shows that leaders and managers often possess attributes that make\nthem better at making decisions as they go along rather than planning a decision-making\nprocess in advance (Allinson, Chell and Hayes, 2000). Likewise, the fast pace and stages\nthat need actors to be reactive or proactive makes many lobbying processes less valuable\nwhen one has to plan far in advance. Some research contends that executives are better\nserved by learning processes through systematic observation of outcomes instead of\nthrough pre-planned materials that may be outdated or obsolete for the current situation\n(Bird, 1988). In this way, our data suggests that the content of lobbying capabilities\nbegins to form before there is any \u2018doing\u2019 at all. As one informant put it:\nRather than jumping in and using a laissez-faire path creating strategy, directors of\npolitical affairs used their choices from previous experience and learning to channel and\nfuel their decisions on the lobbying process. In this way, management thought plays a\nvery important role in developing the architecture of lobbying capability. Consequently,\nwe found that ownership played a vital role in defining the design of the lobbying\ncapability based on networks, structure and human resources.\nTables III and IV summarize the evidence involved in advancing the choices in\ndesign, together with the inter-group issues needing to be resolved before the lobbying\nwould be undertaken. For example, the private and state owned airlines revealed different\npatterns of lobbying practices using their internal and external capabilities (Lyon et al.,\nWe learn by doing. I am always learning at home. In fact that is how we build our\ndecision making process by doing things as we go along. I get home and start to\nthink about the issues on the plate, and then I refer to my library\u2026. in this context,\nwe determine our decision on the choice of level and type of strategy. Then we\nconsider the content for our argument to influence, the targets to contact and the\nmode of direct or indirect lobbying.\n20\n2004): the use of trade association for the compensation package versus action from\nwithin the firms and above all the question of where and by whom lobbying should be\ndelivered.\nTake in Table III\nTake in Table IV\nThis debate was associated across all cases with emergency policy initiatives on steps to\nhelp airlines stay financially sound. A national transport group was set up on this issue\nand included representatives of the airline profession, ministers, and advocacy groups.\nThe following proposition summarizes the nature of the actions associated with lobbying\ncapability design.\nProposition 1: In unpredictable policy contexts, the policy environment moderates the\nlobbying capability design choices more significantly in state owned airlines than in\nprivately owned airlines.\nAssemble the structure to design the lobbying capabilities\nOne of the ways through which lobbying capabilities are designed \u2013 as found in all five\nfirms - was adapting the lobbying capability of the firm. We use the term \u2018adapting\u2019\nbecause it was used by one of our informants and adequately reflects the notion.\nInformants expressed that they were working towards bringing lobbying process to \u2018the\nfollowing stage\u2019 in the unpredictable policy context. Different organizations and their\n21\nrespective departments of political affairs focused on different aspects of management\nand organizing in order to develop their lobbying processes to influence regulators on\ninsurance coverage, security cost and compensations package issues. For instance,\ndeveloping a lobbying capability was associated with greater levels of departmental re-\nstructuring among the top management teams from state owned airlines as opposed to\nprivately owned or publicly listed airlines. In other words, for mainly state owned\nairlines, lobbying activities in this challenging policy context changed, often leading to\nstructural reorganization and formal redefinitions of the responsibilities of new units and\nsubstructures within the political affairs office. These state owned airlines transferred\nmost of their lobbying efforts to interest group representation - through the AEA \u2013 within\nweeks of the 9\/11 attacks.\nOn the other hand, the privately owned airlines did not spend time re-structuring\ntheir departments at the outset like government owned airlines did. Instead, the decision-\nmaking focused initially more on individual influencing with specific national targets, but\nthen realizing that time was of the essence, these firms adopted a dual pronged strategy.\nThis dual pronged lobbying strategy had an individual lobbying component but with a\ngreater level of responsibility transference for decision making to interest group\nrepresentation - the AEA - where there was more of an attempt for a joint problem\nsolving strategy. An informant explained the rationale in more detail from a state owned\nairline:\nIn this crazy environment, we invested more time into structure of our lobbying\nthen in private owned airlines like BA.\n22\nThis finding confirms an extant view of dynamic capabilities as constrained by the\nstructural organization of firms (Teece et al., 1997). At the same time it refutes existing\nviews that organizational structures tend to be static and impede the development of a\nfirm\u2019s dynamic capabilities (Marengo et al., 2000). Our observation suggests that state\nowned airlines were re-structuring to reconfigure their lobbying capability so as to align\nit with the new policy environment, while private airlines had a more sophisticated\nlobbying capability that was better prepared for unpredictable events. Moreover, private\nairlines had what they perceived to be good political resources and lobbying\ncompetencies for the post-9\/11 period, which they used to exert individual influence from\nthe outset. Indeed, departmental modification was found to be slightly different between\nprivate and state owned airlines. Privately owned airlines believed that they needed to\nfocus more on the human and network resources to modify their lobbying capability.\nThere were some interaction effects between organizational structure and human\nresources, where people were taken out to develop lobbying capabilities in order to make\nit efficient for potentially new policy issues. Incidentally, we found that efficiency was\ndictating the lobbying capability development process and as a result of this, policy\ncontext was creating a sort of push effect on airlines. The nature of the accounts arising\nfrom the focused management choices on structure is summarized in the following\nproposition:\nProposition 2: In unpredictable policy contexts, department restructuring occurs more\nsubstantively in state owned airlines than in private owned airlines.\n23\nAssemble the human resources to design the lobbying capabilities\nAnother important variable confirming ideas from extant research on dynamic\ncapabilities is human capital, which links them to changes in specific functional\ncapabilities (Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000) and knowledge flows (Helfat and Rabitscheck,\n2000). However, our observations accord greater importance to the role of human capital\nin the process of developing lobbying capabilities. In particular, it appears that\nidentifying and gaining access to what is considered top talent in the area of government\naffairs is an important factor in designing lobbying capabilities. As one informant from a\nstate owned airline said:\nPost September 11th we realized that we needed new people who had better EU\nknowledge, as that is where things were moving.\nFurthermore, our research highlights the role of organizational processes not only in\ndesign but also in discovering what new lobbying capabilities should be developed.\nTogether these insights suggest that the development of firms\u2019 lobbying capabilities can\nbe understood as change processes unfolding at two levels: a lower level associated with\nthe upgrading of the organization\u2019s management capability in terms of staffing key\npositions with more experienced and skilled managers and redefining responsibilities at\ndifferent levels of the organizational hierarchy; and a higher level associated with\ndeveloping new lobbying competencies in order to respond to changing political\nenvironments. These two levels are driven by changing perceptions of top managers\nabout what it takes to succeed in their nonmarket contexts and what managerial and\nlobbying competencies are required to respond to the changes.\n24\nAnalyzing the data across all five firms suggested that the momentum for design\nchoices in lobbying capabilities depended on the amount of competency that the\norganization managed to accumulate, which depended on who was hired. Therefore,\ninteraction effects and overlaps were found between human resources and competence\nthat played a role in developing a lobbying capability. The following summarizes the\nnature of the action associated with fragmented lobbying capability design:\nProposition 3: In unpredictable policy contexts, strategic hiring moderates the structure\nof lobbying capabilities more significantly in state owned airlines than in private owned\nairlines.\nAssemble the network relationship to design the lobbying capabilities\nThirdly, the development of lobbying capabilities frequently entails the creation of new\nlobbying competencies by means of re-configuring network resources. Relationships\n(also called social capital or networks), were stipulated by nearly all informants as an\nimportant variable in the development of lobbying capabilities. Cast in diverse styles of\nargument (Granovetter, 1973; Lin et al., 1981; Coleman, 1990; Nahapiet and Ghoshal,\n1998; Finkelstein et al., 2007), social capital has become a ubiquitous metaphor in the\nstudy of organizations. The compelling idea embodied in the notion of social capital is\nimplicitly or explicitly present in various research streams that focus on how social ties\nenhance an actor\u2019s ability to attain its goals. This research identifies one main way in\nwhich political networks can enhance individual and organizational performance. First,\npolitical networks can facilitate access to information, additional resources, and\nopportunities (Campbell et al., 1986; Podolny, 2001). Thus, actors with networks rich in\n25\nsocial capital have privileged access to resources and nonmarket information, and this\nshould make them better at leading, organizing, and mobilizing other actors towards\ncollective goals. As one executive informant put it:\nBeing a state airline means obviously that we can talk to the national government.\nThe ownership plays a big role in deciding how to lobby. In our case because we\nare a government-owned company, we don\u2019t have to lobby the same ways as\nBritish Airways or KLM. We spoke directly to the government, but mainly used\nAEA due to time factor in this context.\nEarly research on social capital focused on the value of relationships as conductors of\ninformation and channels to access resources or social support (Lin, Ensel and Vaughn,\n1981). Consistent with the emphasis on relationships, this research has found the\nstrength of the ties between network resources and the top management team within the\npolitical affairs office to be very important in facilitating access to the appropriate\npolitical information and resources. Vice versa, we found that government receiving\nposition papers from airlines allowed them to understand the severity of the problem or\nchallenge facing airline companies. We also found two main ways in which the structure\nof the network surrounding a given top management team can confer advantage on the\nfirm by facilitating access to information-resources, and opportunities - and by helping\novercome dilemmas of collective action (Burt, 1997). First, the structure revolved\naround the relationship influence series, where the actual order of who to contact was\ncrucial in determining what informers called \u2018best\u2019 influence. Second, the relationship\nmicro targets, meaning whom to target, in this time frame, played a vital role. It was\nmanagement action that determined the relationship series and target for each senior\n26\nexecutive. This management intent played a vital role in developing robust lobbying\ncapability.\nAs the time factor played an important role, the airlines were looking to exert\nrapid influence during this period, so they decided to use the AEA, which had extensive\nnetworks and resources, whilst simultaneously using their own network resources to\ndevelop lobbying capabilities. The level of development of lobbying influence depended\non the structural configuration that the organization managed, which depended on who\nwas hired and worked at the organization. Therefore, interaction effects and overlaps\nwere found between the structure and the network that played a role in developing\nlobbying capabilities.\nThe way in which top management intervene plays a very important role in\ndeveloping the design for lobbying processes. Our integrated framework presented in\nFigure 1 introduces the propositions and the system of variables pertaining to lobbying\ncapability design. We first describe relationships between the senior managers, the\nowners and the three main resources (structure, networks and human capital). We then\nexamine how the policy context parameters moderate the design choices of lobbying\ncapabilities. It is important to note that we provide an integrated theoretical construct\nthat extends the dynamic capability perspective by unbundling the links between\nmanagers, resources and capabilities, taking into account airline features and context.\nThe central part of Figure 1 illustrates the reciprocal relationships between the\ncomponents that emerged dynamically in the course of specific lobbying actions for the\ncompensation package.\nTake in Figure 1\n27\nIt is worth noting that although Figure 1 sets management choices at the centre of the\nframework, indirectly suggesting that management is able to steer networks, human\ncapital and structure, this is only true to some extent. We know that management choices\n(Child 1984) are also constrained by a set of uncertain - and uncontrollable - events. The\nlatter means that the effectiveness of managerial choices is dependent on the nature of\nexternal and dynamic uncertain events and, as such, has limitations.\nDISCUSSION AND CONTRIBUTION\nIn this paper we addressed the answer the question of \u2018how\u2019 lobbying capabilities were\ndesigned and whether distinct lobbying patterns emerged during this unpredictable period\nin different airlines. We found that the role of the policy environment and ownership\neffects play a crucial role in senior managers design choices of a higher-level lobbying\ncapability combination (internal and external). Furthermore, the rationale shows that\nmanagement interventions are affected by their resource endowments and the given\npolicy environment, which ultimately impacts how lobbying capabilities are designed and\ncombined to create influence. Each lobbying activity during this period required\nrelevant doses of directed, conscious efforts at the highest level of the organizational and\ntrade association management hierarchy (Dosi et al., 2000).\nRecent work on the design of dynamic capabilities has emphasized the\nconstraining effect of organizational history, organizational learning, technological\ntrajectories, evolutionary paths created by organizational routines and beliefs of top\nmanagers which tend towards inertia (Teece et al., 1997; Tripsas and Gavetti, 2000;\n28\nSalvato, 2009). These studies attempt to explore the high-level activities that link to\nmanagement ability to sense and then seize opportunities (Teece, 2007; Salvato, 2009).\nHowever, these studies do not explore how strategic managers can design capabilities to\nnavigate and deal with unanticipated threats. Our study examines how managers in a\nspecific industry and policy context sense and seize external opportunities so as to design\ndynamic capabilities that are used effectively during periods of policy uncertainty (Teece,\n2007).\nOur first contribution is to highlight a heterogeneous combination of internal and\nexternal lobbying capabilities. These are utilized differently by state and non-state owned\nairlines to leverage on their political resources so as to create influence and consequently\nobtain favorable compensation package. Recent work has looked at how various\ncapabilities interact with each other to sustain competitive advantage (Salvato, 2009).\nWe build on those studies to identify different capability design patterns between state\nand non-state owned airlines in the way they combine and aggregate their lobbying\ncapabilities. The general patterns found combinations of capabilities with the\nmanagement focus level inclined towards the external lobbying processes for leveraging\nand deploying resources in order to create influence. From the outset, this was more the\ncase in state owned airlines than in non-state owned airlines post 9\/11. Yet according to\nthe respondents, the pattern was fairly similar after a few months for both state and non-\nstate airlines (apart from Lufthansa, who believed they used a more balanced process\ncombination). Nevertheless, the shift to the external lobbying processes occurred because\nairlines believed that they had less time to maneuver and everyone had common interests\non the compensation issue. The decision to leverage AEA\u2019s resources was more to defend\ncompetitive positions.\n29\nHaving looked at the combination aspects of internal and external lobbying\ncapabilities, our second contribution is to note that dynamic capability literature has\nneglected to look at the effects of ownership on capability design through adaptations. In\nour post 9\/11 context we find that the capability design is either supported or constrained\nby ownership structure. Moreover, we find that the privately owned airlines have a more\nsophisticated political capability design, and rely less on external capabilities but instead\ntry to use both internal and external capabilities.\nFinally, research has elaborated the concept of managerial choice to refer to the\ncapacity of individual managers to modify the resource base of an organization (Adner\nand Helfat, 2003). Our inductive lobbying capability design framework has multiple\nimplications for government affairs managers. In particular, managers need to be able to\nacquire, accumulate (political resource endowment), and divest political resources\n(political resources i.e. interest groups like AEA, consultants or in-house staff) to have\nthe most effective resource portfolio at any given time. Managers should also have the\ncompetence necessary to bundle resources to create effective political lobbying\ncapabilities. Firms especially need to be able to develop new or leverage current lobbying\ncapabilities, as policy environmental changes can greatly reduce the value of their current\ncapabilities. Managers must also effectively manage the feedback and learning processes\nnecessary to continuously update their thinking and adjust the political resource portfolio.\nCONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS\nPrevious studies on lobbying capabilities are missing an account of how these capabilities\nare designed over time in a given policy context. This paper addressed that issue by\nproviding an account of the genesis and design of lobbying capabilities within European\n30\nflag carrier airlines in the post 9\/11 period. It also highlighted that there were design\nvariations due to ownership effects on the strategic decisions.\nOur study suggests that lobbying capabilities are not vague and that, if properly\nleveraged, may contribute to market advantage. Our data shows lobbying capabilities\nrelate to specific processes that are developed by a set of strong and distinct variables.\nData also shows that the design of lobbying capabilities depends on focused management\neffort, and these management mindsets consist of particular types of heuristics that\ninclude those about how to affect public policy, e.g. which politician to target, which\nnetworks relationship to invest in, in what order to approach the networks and when to\nbest influence the relevant political actors (Vining et al., 2005). While the details of\nlobbying capability may be unique to a particular firm - which political person to\napproach or which network to target - the underlying structure is strikingly different\nbetween private and state airlines. These content differences - and similarities - imply\nthat lobbying capabilities should be internal or\/and external in structure. The unequal\nlevel in the lobbying capability is due to senior managers developing them from different\nstarting points and along different evolutionary paths (Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000). Our\nresearch findings also show that lobbying capabilities are fairly homogeneous in\nunpredictable contexts in a later lobbying capability time frame, whereas heterogeneity is\nmore evident in the early phase.\nLooking at the management choices of senior executives across the different\nownership compositions and issues reveals that privately owned airlines shared a\ncommon form of design choice in this unpredictable policy context. This pattern suggests\nthat policy issue types may affect the mindset of senior management, in conjunction with\nstakeholders that they engage with, and this consequently affects the lobbying capability\n31\ndesign choices. We can see that each airline in this study demonstrated two types of\nlobbying form - internal and external. This raises the issue of investing more in internal\nlobbying capabilities versus external capabilities. This finding suggests that there may be\nfirms in which leaders inevitably become involved in developing their lobbying around\nany policy issue and others in which there are dynamic sets of stakeholders (owners) who\nalmost always seek to contribute to the formation of lobbying capability, irrespective of\nthe policy issue.\nThis paper raises important questions for future research on dynamic capability\nand corporate lobbying activity. In particular, on the antecedents of political lobbying -\nespecially the role of the specific policy issue and organization involved in determining\nthe form (the distinct pattern of leader-ownership interaction) of lobbying capability\ndevelopment. Although in this study neither ownership nor organization alone\ndetermined the form of lobbying, each appeared to have some impact.\nREFERENCES\nAdner, R. and Helfat, C.

Also, relations among groups\nwithin a firm and those in the non-market environment.\n41\nOrganizational The formal organizational structure, its planning and coordinating systems.\n42\nTable III: Managerial Choices in an unpredictable context (Non-state owned airlines)\nCase Political resources leveraged Quotation Exemplifying the\nDepth of the Debate\nSAS\nPrivate Owned\nNetworks *** We were lobbying the EU system mostly through AEA but we also obviously used our national EU representatives. We addressed\nthe Scandinavian governments and parliaments for the compensation package.\n*** To make sure people hear you, you must contact your top trumps quickly, then start contacting other friends at other airlines and\nthe AEA.\nHuman *** We kept everything in-house, as that is the best way to keep control on outcomes. Yes, everything was done in-house, so that we\ncould save money. Hiring consultants is far too expensive and we need to keep the influence knowledge in house\nStructure *** At this time we needed to be effective, efficient and more serious about lobbying. Influence on the political decision making process\ncannot be made from a distance. You have to be there, physically present in the Brussels environment. That is a structure we introduced\nbefore 9\/11 - in 2000. Therefore, there was no real change in our structure. But this was different in state owned airlines.\nLufthansa\nPrivate Owned\nNetworks *** I think you could say that in this context building new networks was not important because we already had the networks and time\nwas knocking on our door. In general, I would say the first most important thing we used would be the current network from our people.\nThe second thing is that our organization has a strong reputation, so this helps to build up such a network and keep your network\nhealthy. Of course the contact maker has to be well connected and articulate in relaying the information.\nHuman ** The contacts cannot be born overnight. It\u2019s more complex in our lobbying design. For example in our department after September 11\nwe had few people from different fields of knowledge. We had thinkers - which is important - and then contactors. At least that is how\nwe worked then and still work.\nStructure *** We did not change our structure. We remained structurally intact with no modifications. Like I said earlier. This department is very\nspecialized and each person plays a very important role. Lufthansa can be weakened if any of them are taken out of the big picture. Yes\nother departments did lose people, like in marketing, but our function is viewed as a very important function.\nKLM\nPrivate Owned\nNetworks *** Well, post-9\/11, we built it both ways. We like to form them naturally and by actually targeting specific people we know that might\nhelp us in achieving what we want. We were contacting all the people that we knew had power to get the insurance issue, aviation cost\nissue and compensation package issue resolved without affecting our revenue.\nHuman *** Post-9\/11 meant that we had to react quickly, as time meant less money and potential future problems. Having to react quickly\nmeant that we had no time to recruit new people, and in actual fact it did not make sense hiring new people in this time for us.\nStructure *** What we have done is we have slightly restructured in such a way that we were getting smaller in number slowly after 9\/11. My\ndepartment is now just four while there were five other people in the same area in 2001.\n\u00aa The asterisks show the strength of evidence from KLM, SAS and Lufthansa\n*** Strong \u2013 Strong evidence\n** Moderate \u2013 Moderate evidence\n* Weak \u2013 Weak evidence\n43\nTable IV: Managerial choices in the unpredictable context (State owned airlines)\nCase Airline Political resources leveraged Quotation Exemplifying the\nDepth of the Debate\nAlitalia\nMajority public\nowned\nNetworks\n*** Being a state airline means obviously that we can talk to the national government. The ownership plays a big role in deciding how to\nlobby. In our case because we are a government-owned company, we don\u2019t have to lobby the same ways as British Airways or KLM. We\nspoke directly to the government, but mainly used AEA due to time factor in this context.\nHuman *** We had people with some good knowledge in place to deal with the issues arising from 9\/11. But you need more time to influence at the\nEU level. Maybe our structure and competence was more nationally oriented then EU level, which we tried to fix around 2004 by hiring new\npeople.\nStructure ** We re-shaped in early 2002 and did the main restructuring around 2003. But we definitely re-enforced our lobbying activities because of\nall the consequences of the 9\/11 attacks.\nTAP Air\nPortugal\nMajority public\nowned\nNetworks *** We used direct contacts, had meetings and phone calls with the treasury, which was not that successful in my view. But yes, I believe\nthat AEA was the most important way to get our message heard.\n*** I think we were slightly limited in who we could talk to being government-owned. But this can be good, as you can well imagine, being\nowned by the government means you can organize meetings quickly with important people to inform them about your position. This means\nwe can be heard in Europe quickly. As we all know there are good things and bad things to being owned by a state.\nHuman ** We realized that we needed new people who had better EU knowledge, as that is where things were moving.\n** People are important and we think that 9\/11 hit us hard. We had to lobby using various routines like meetings, communicating using our\nphones and face to face, but our people were less EU focused. Therefore AEA became a very important channel for us to have our voice\nheard.\nStructure ** Oh yes, it became even more crucial to restructure our department after 9\/11. Actually that is when they hired me. They changed a bit the\nprofile of the director for that position in the sense that before the person that was in charge had a more national background. After\nSeptember 11, I was recruited because our firm wanted someone that had more of an EU background.\n\u00aa The asterisks show the strength of evidence from TAP Air Portugal and Alitalia\n*** Strong \u2013 Strong evidence\n** Moderate \u2013 Moderate evidence\n* Weak \u2013 Weak evidence\n44\nFigure 1: An Integrated framework for lobbying design\nStructure\nNetworks\nHuman capital\nManagement Choices\n\uf0b7 EXPERIENCE\n\uf0b7 LEARNING BY DOING\nPolicy Environment\nOwnershipOwnership\nP3 P2\nLobbying Capabilities\nP1\n"}
