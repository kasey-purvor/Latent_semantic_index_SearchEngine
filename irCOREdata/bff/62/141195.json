Regulators frequently face a risk-benefit trade-off since zero risk is neither\npracticable nor affordable. Although it is accepted that cost-benefit analysis is important\nin many scenarios of risk management, what role it should play in a decision process is\nstill controversial. One criticism of cost-benefit analysis is that decision makers should\nconsider marginal benefits and costs, not present ones, in their decision making. In this\npaper, we investigate the problem of regulatory decision making under risk by applying\nexpected utility theory and present a new approach of cost-benefit analysis. Directly\ntaking into consideration the reduction of the risks, this approach achieves marginal cost-\nbenefit analysis. By applying this approach, the optimal regulatory decision that\nmaximizes the marginal benefit of risk reduction can be considered. This provides a\ntransparent and reasonable criterion for stakeholders involved in the regulatory activity.\nAn example of evaluating seismic retrofitting alternatives is provided to demonstrate the\npotential of the proposed approach.\n2Key words: Regulatory decision making, cost-benefit analysis, ALARP, expected utility\ntheory\n1 INTRODUCTION\nOne long-standing theme within regulatory risk management is evaluating the cost-\nbenefit of managing risk. Assuming a risk warrants active management, what is a\nreasonable spend on risk management; when does this spend become disproportionate to\nthe benefits that a managed risk brings and how far should investment in risk\nmanagement continue, if at all, beyond the point whereby the risk is deemed\ninsignificant? In essence, this is an optimisation problem inherently bound up with the\nlaw of diminishing returns, in that continued investment in risk management results in\never-decreasing incremental reductions in risk of lesser incremental value. Wise risk\nmanagers understand that the principal benefits of risk reduction are likely to be secured\nby targeting resources at a relatively few features of a problem, and that this action will\nbe optimised when the risk is reduced to that which is as low as reasonably practicable\n(ALARP) or achievable (ALARA). Thereafter, increased investment may become\ndisproportionate to the benefits gained. ALARP and ALARA are well-researched\nconcepts within health and safety legislation, radiation protection and to a limited extent\nwithin environmental protection. ALARP has been controversial and subject to several\ncourt rulings; especially with respect to what constitutes a reasonable expectation of\ninvestment by a regulated party, and thus the concept of gross disproportionality (of\ninvestment in risk management compared to the risk reduction benefits gained). A\n3familiar regulatory discussion involves the regulator and regulated party exchanging\nviews on (i) the initial significance of a risk, thus triggering a risk management action\nwhere the risk is deemed significant; followed by (ii) an enthusiastic debate on the\npracticalities and costs of risk management (often requiring additional investment), which\nmay secures agreement over the residual risk level and degree of investment. What\nguidance can researchers bring to these debates?\nFig.1 illustrates the framework the HSE (Health and Safety Executive, UK) has\nadopted in its regulation process [1]. The inverted triangle represents an increasing level\nof risk for a particular hazardous activity as we move from the bottom of the triangle\ntowards the top. The regulators\u2019 objective is twofold. Firstly to ensure that the risks do\nnot exceed an unacceptable level, and secondly to ensure that risk management measures\nput in place to reduce risk are proportionate to the risk. Practically, the degree of risk\noften falls in the ALARP region, so that benefits are achieved while being prepared to\ntolerate the risks from the activities. This framework provides a reasonable description of\nregulatory decision making under risk. However, suppose there are several feasible\nsolutions to an environmental problem, each of which leads to a degree of residual risk\nthat falls into the ALARP region, for example. How the regulator should choose among\nthese alternatives?\nThis is the field of options appraisal for risk reduction, of which an economic\ncomponent is only one aspect. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) was originally used to\nevaluate the desirability of governmental intervention in markets, and has now been used\nin many areas of public decision making. Typical fields of application include\ntransportation [2, 3], health care [4, 5], environment [6-10], and safety [11, 12]. The\n4essential foundations of cost-benefit analysis are: benefits and costs are narrowly defined\nas monetary values, and an activity is worthwhile only if its benefits exceed its costs. A\nbenefit-cost ratio which is the ratio of total benefits relative to total costs is commonly\nused as one of the criteria in regulatory decision making. Some important issues on CBA\nhave been widely investigated, for example, uncertainty [13, 14], discounting rates [15-\n17], and equity [18].\nMost researchers agree that benefit-cost ratios are neither necessary nor sufficient for\nthe regulatory decisions, partially because economic factors are usually not the most\nimportant, and partially because not all important factors for decision making can be\nquantified [19, 18]. In some areas, the regulation of nuclear waste disposal for example,\nthe optimisation of risk reduction in the ALARP region has received considerable\nattention.\nOne criticism of cost-benefit analysis is that decision makers should consider\nmarginal benefits, not present ones, in decision making. Marginal benefit is the increase\nof total benefit as a result of an extra investment in risk reduction. This concept grew out\nof attempts by economists to explain the determination of price [20, 21]. It is often\nassumed in economics that as the amount of any one input is increased, holding all other\ninputs constant, the amount that output increases for each additional unit of the expanding\ninput will generally decrease. This law of diminishing marginal utility implies that there\nexists an optimal amount of input such that the efficiency of the investment is\nmaximized. The objective of marginal analysis then, is to find out the optimal solution\namong those alternatives of investment. Within the context of risk regulation, marginal\nbenefit represents the marginal effect of risk reduction, mathematically the first derivative\n5of the total benefit with respect to the amount of investment, from a range of alternatives.\nIn most scenarios of risk regulation, the possibilities of disaster (risk) can only be reduced\nto some values above zero and further reduction will be unaffordable. Therefore,\nmarginal analysis can contribute to the optimisation of risk reduction in the ALARP\nregion. We have not found any application of marginal analysis in CBA. The reason\nmight lie in the difficulty of connecting a reduction of risk with monetary values of\nbenefit and cost, especially in the fields of health and safety and environmental\nlegislation where externalities are prominent. Below, we propose an approach that\nmaximizes the marginal benefit of risk reduction by estimating the first order condition of\nexpected utility. With this approach, different alternatives can be compared according to\ntheir efficiencies in reducing risk with least monetary expenditure.\nThis approach could be a supplement to the framework of ALARP and quantified risk\nassessment. Applying ALARP requires a comparison of different credible risk reduction\nstrategies in order to demonstrate at what level the risks are optimised. It is difficult to\nachieve it because we lack criteria on how efficient the risks could be reduced for each\nrisk management option [22, 23]. This approach is especially suitable for the comparisons\nof different risk reduction methods.\n2 AN EXPECTED UTILITY APPROACH OF COST-BENEFIT\nANALYSIS\nExpected utility theory has long been an approach to deal with the problem of decision\nmaking under risk and uncertainty in economics. The axiomatic hypothesis of expected\nutility is that the decision maker can make a possibility distribution over possible\n6outcomes of activities. When applying expected utility theory to regulatory decision\nmaking, we need to assume that the regulator has a utility function (or preference) over\npublic wealth. This assumption is reasonable because the objective of the regulators is to\nregulate specific activities on behalf of the public. Notice that this assumption is different\nfrom the general assumption in economics that the utility function of an agent is the\nevaluation of his\/her own wealth. In economics, individual decision makers are assumed\nto be self-interested. This assumption is not suitable for the case of regulatory decision\nmaking because public welfare is a primary objective. Assuming that the regulator only\ncares for his\/her own benefit in regulation is equivalent to assuming that no regulator can\nbe component.\nSuppose an activity may lead to several possible outcomes and each outcome can be\nexpressed as a monetary value. Assume the decision maker has a complete, reflexive,\ntransitive, and continuous evaluation over these monetary outcomes, or in other words,\nhe\/she possesses a von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function. Let x be an outcome and\nlet X be the set of possible outcomes. Let p be a simple probability measure on X, thus\n))(,),(),(( 21 nxpxpxpp \uf04c\uf03d where )( ixp are probabilities of outcome Xxi \uf0ce\n( ni ,,1\uf04c\uf03d ) occurring. Note that there are finite elements Xx\uf0ce for which )(xp 0\uf03e , and\nthat )( ixp 0\uf0b3 for all ni ,,1\uf04c\uf03d and 1)(1 \uf03d\uf0e5 \uf03d\nn\ni i\nxp . The expected utility over the set of\noutcomes X is expressed as,\n)()()(\n1 i\nn\ni i\nxpxuXU \uf0e5 \uf03d\uf03d (1)\nwhere )(\uf0d7u is the von Neumann Morgenstern utility function.\n7Let h\uf0b3 be a binary relation over U so that YX h\uf0b3 \uf0db )()( YUXU \uf0b3 , which means\nthat X is preferred to, or equivalent to, Y if and only if )()( YUXU \uf0b3 . Similarly, we have\nYX h\uf03e \uf0db )()( YUXU \uf03e and X~Y \uf0db )()( YUXU \uf03d . In this way, individuals can\nbuild a set of preferences over several alternatives.\nConsider a scenario of regulatory decision making under risk (disposal of nuclear\nwastes, for example) where the risk is the possible realisation of environmental hazard.\nSuppose that the hazard may lead to a loss of wealth Nw Aw\uf02d (measured by a monetary\nvalue), where Nw denotes the original wealth and Aw the reduced wealth if the hazard\nhas occurred. In order to keep the risk within the acceptable range, an amount of money\nC is going to be invested. The objective of regulatory decision making is to find the\noptimal amount of investment that maximizes the public good.\nLet \uf067 denote the possibility (or risk) of the occurrence of an accident. We assume the\nexistence of a state-independent utility function of the regulator )(wu defined over\npayoffs, thus:\n\uf03d),( CU \uf067 )( Cwu A \uf02d\uf067 )()1( Cwu N \uf02d\uf02d\uf02b \uf067 (2)\nNotice that ),( CU \uf067 represents the expected utility of the regulator over public wealth\nand that \uf067 is a function of C in the above equation.\nThe regulator\u2019s objective is to find the optimal amount of expenditure given Aw and\nNw . Thus the optimization problem is:\nmax \uf03d),( CU \uf067 )( Cwu A \uf02d\uf067 )()1( Cwu N \uf02d\uf02d\uf02b \uf067\nwhich yields the first order condition:\n0)()1()()()(),( \uf03d\uf02d\uf0a2\uf02d\uf02b\uf02d\uf0a2\uf02d\uf02d\uf0a2\uf02b\uf02d\uf0a2\uf03d\uf0b6\uf0b6 CwuCwuCwuCwuCCU NNAA \uf067\uf067\uf067\uf067\uf067\n8or, rearranging:\n)()1()())()(( CwuCwuCwuCwu NAAN \uf02d\uf0a2\uf02d\uf02b\uf02d\uf0a2\uf03d\uf02d\uf02d\uf02d\uf0a2 \uf067\uf067\uf067 (3)\nLet\u2019s first consider the case that the regulator is risk-neutral, that is, the utility\nfunction )(wu is linear over w . )(wu\uf0a2 is then a constant and, without loss of generality,\nsuppose that kwu \uf03d\uf0a2 )( .

The line F which satisfies\n(4) intersects the curve )(C\uf067 at a point A . Point A denotes the optimal solution of\nbenefit-expenditure tradeoff that maximizes the expected utility. The expenditure is optC\nwhen the risk is reduced to the level of Opt\uf067 , which means that the ratio of marginal\nreduction of the risk to the expenditure is maximized, or in other words, the risk is\nreduced to the degree so that a further reduction needs much more expenditure and is\ntherefore not economical.\nThe optimal expenditure Opt\uf067 depends crucially on the assumption of linearity\nproperty of the utility function. Suppose, however, the regulator is not risk-neutral,\noptimal expenditure will deviate from Opt\uf067 . When the regulator is risk-averse, he would\nrather invest more money to reduce the risk involved, and there should be\n)(1 An ww \uf02d\uf03c\uf0a2\uf067 (5)\n9Consider the line G (as shown in Fig.2) that satisfies (5), for example, a risk-averse\nagent\u2019s decision may be point B , with which the expenditure increases ( OptB CC \uf03e ) and\nthe possibility of an accident decreases ( OptB \uf067\uf067 \uf03c ) compared to the risk-neutral case. The\nmore risk-averse an agent is, the more expenditure he\/she would like to invest in order to\nreduce the risk.\nIf the agent is risk-prone, on the other hand, he would prefer an alternative with less\nexpenditure and higher risk to the alternative with Opt\uf067 and OptC .\nThis benefit-expenditure analysis is not sufficient for a regulator to make their final\ndecision because it provides only one of the criteria that should be taken into\nconsideration. Notice that the alternative with OptC is optimal only if Opt\uf067 is an\nacceptable value of risk (as shown in Fig. 3(a)). If an alternative may cause an intolerable\nlevel of risk, it is unacceptable no matter how much benefit it will create.\nArrow and Lind [24] have indicated that a regulator should behave in a risk- neutral\nfashion. Under the assumption of risk-neutral, the regulatory decisions could be\ntransparent and consistent among the stakeholders.\n3 AN EXAMPLE OF APPLICATION\nThe city of Istanbul, Turkey is within an area with the possibility that strong earthquakes\nwill occur in the near future due to the underlying geography. Since 1999 earthquakes\nnear Istanbul have caused more than 18,000 deaths. As a consequence, there has been\nincreasing awareness of trying to reduce the risk of loss (especially loss of human life)\nwhen a damaging earthquake happens.\n10\nSmyth et al. [25, 26] introduced a cost-benefit analysis of seismic retrofitting\nmeasures of a representative apartment building in Istanbul, in which three alternative\noptions of retrofitting the building were given in order to reinforce its structure. These\nalternatives denote three levels of retrofit: braced, partial shear wall, and full shear wall\nsolutions. The probabilities of the building collapse and mitigation cost for these retrofit\noptions together with the option of no retrofit are listed in Table 1.\nThe loss in damaging earthquakes is determined by evaluating the expected damage\nto the property and the reduction in fatalities from earthquakes. The direct economic loss\ndue to building damage or collapse is estimated to be $250,000. Let LN and V denote\nthe expected number of fatalities and the expected cost of a human life respectively. The\ncost of fatalities can then be expressed as LN V .\nWe now apply the proposed approach to this issue in order to evaluate and compare\nmitigation alternatives. The objective of choosing between different alternatives is to\nprevent the building from collapsing in earthquakes so as to reduce the expected number\nof fatalities. It should be pointed out that the objective of this example is to demonstrate\nthe usage and potential of the proposed approach, rather than to focus on determining\nprecise values of this specific instance. Instead of evaluating the expected number of\nfatalities and cost of human lives, LN and V , we consider the cases of different values of\nLN and V so that a link between evaluating mitigation alternatives and the expected cost\nof fatalities can be established. If the social discount rate is taken into consideration, the\nnet present value of the cost of fatalities will be significantly lower than LN V . When the\nsocial discount rate is set to be 5%, for example, the net present value of $100 is\napproximately $29.53 if the payment will stochastically occur in 50 years. For a detailed\n11\ndiscussion about social discount rate and the evaluation of human lives, see Boardman\n[17] and Viscusi [27].\nLet\u2019s first assume \uf03dV $500,000, and discount rate is zero, and consider the cases of\n0\uf03dLN , 2, 5, 10. The total loss of wealth can be expressed as AN ww \uf02d = LN V +$250,000.\nThe computation of the optimal alternative is shown in Figure 4. Each alternative Ai\n(i=1,2,3,4) can be depicted by a point in X-Y coordinates when X and Y axis denote cost\nof alternative and the possibility of collapse respectively. For each value of LN , we can\nfind a line that satisfies (4) and intersects an alternative and that all other alternatives lie\non the left side of this line. Then, the alternative that intersects with the line is the optimal\nsolution. Consider the case of 0\uf03dLN , for example. We have \uf067 \uf0a2= 000,250\n1 according to\n(4). If we draw a line that satisfies\ndX\ndY =\n000,250\n1 through A1, all of A2, A3 and A4 lie\non the left side of this line. Thus, A1 is the optimal alternative for 0\uf03dLN , which means\nthat remaining status quo is the best choice if there will be no fatalities in future\nearthquakes.\nIn this way, the optimal alternative for any value of LN can be computed. The results\nare shown in Figure 5. The optimal alternative is A1 for 1,0\uf03dLN ; A2 for 2\uf03dLN ; and\nA3 for 3\uf0b3LN .\nIf we use the cost of fatalities LN V as a variable, the optimal alternative is actually a\nfunction of LN V . Let optA denotes the optimal alternative, we have\noptA =\nVN\nVN\nVN\nA\nA\nA\nL\nL\nL\n\uf03c\n\uf0a3\uf03c\n\uf0a3\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ee\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ed\n\uf0ec\n$1,083,333if\n333,083,1$$616,666if\n666,616$if\n3\n2\n1\n12\nIf the social discount rate is set to be 5%, for example, the optimal alternative will be,\noptA =\nVN\nVN\nVN\nA\nA\nA\nL\nL\nL\n\uf03c\n\uf0a3\uf03c\n\uf0a3\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ee\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ed\n\uf0ec\n$3,668,550if\n550,668,3$$2,088,249if\n249,088,2$if\n3\n2\n1\nThis can be expressed as Figure 6. The optimal retrofit alternative can be determined\nfor any value of social discount rate and LN V in this way.\nIn order to make a comparison between the outcomes of Smyth et al. [26] and ours,\nwe introduce the factor of time horizon. Briefly, time horizon NT indicates the time\nperiod that the apartment building will last. Although the building may be expected to\nlast for 50 years if the area does not experience a severe earthquake, there may be an\ninterest in evaluating the attractiveness of the investment using shorter time horizons.\nOther settings include social discount rate \uf03dd 0.1, value of the building $250,000, and\nthe cost of fatalities LN V =$10 million.\nThe results of optimal alternatives over different time horizons are shown in Fig.7. By\ncomparing Fig. 7 with Table 2, it shows that our results are consistent with that of Smyth\net al. [26] in most cases except the case when time horizon is equal to five years. The\nadvantage of our approach is that the alternatives are compared with each other by means\nof their efficiencies in the reduction of the risks.\n4 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH\nMarginal analysis based on the philosophy of utilitarianism is widely applied to\nachieve economic efficiency. Utilitarian philosophy suggests that decisions be made with\nthe ultimate objective of maximizing societal welfare. In this study, we propose a\n13\n\u2018marginal\u2019 approach for regulatory decision making under risk. This approach offers an\nanalysis of the best alternative that maximizes the ratio of marginal reduction of the risk\nto the expenditure, which means that the reduction of the risk can be taken into\nconsideration within the context of CBA directly.\nWhile this study makes a preliminary effort to link the results of economic analysis\nwith the framework of ALARP, it should be remembered that it has been conducted using\nsome assumptions, for example the assumptions of the regulator\u2019s utility function over\npublic wealth and the regulator is payoff-maximized. These assumptions may be\ndebatable outside the field of economics.\nRegulatory decision making is generally a process that many stakeholders are\ninvolved. Although the regulator\u2019s views can be decisive when there is a disagreement on\nthe issue of regulation, stakeholders\u2019 opinions are never negligible, especially when\nseriously consequence is possible. Actually, there are always discussions and negotiations\nbetween the regulator and other stakeholders that may include the operators, regulation\nadvisors, scientists, and government policy maker, etc before a regulatory decision has\nbeen made. Group decision making is a complex problem in that many individual, group\nand contextual factors may take effect. If the interactions between stakeholders of\nregulation are taken into consideration, the regulatory decision making turns out to be the\nnegotiation between stakeholders.\nThe costs and benefits of risk reduction are rarely distributed equally across all\ncommunities exposed to hazards. Most cost benefit analyses concentrates on net costs\nand net benefits so that perspectives of different stakeholders could not been taken into\naccount. Theoretically, this problem of equity is to some extent solvable by means of\n14\nnegotiation. In our future research regulatory decision making will be investigated as a\nprocess of group decisions in which negotiation between stakeholders, brokering of\nscientific knowledge, influence of power hierarchy is considered.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis research was supported by EPSRC (Engineering and Physical Sciences Research\nCouncil) grant (Ref: EP\/E017975\/1).
