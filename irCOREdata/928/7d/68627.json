The flux J may depend on friction G exponentially strongly, over an\nexponentially long period; for small enough temperatures, J\u0001G\u0002 undergoes marked oscillations in the\nrange of small G, and the time evolution of J changes drastically as G exceeds a critical value.\nPACS numbers: 05.40.\u2013a, 02.50.\u2013 r, 05.20.\u2013yIn his celebrated work [1], Kramers considered noise-\ninduced escape from a single metastable potential well.\nHis principal result was that, after a short period of time\nduring which quasiequilibrium is formed within the well,\nthe escape flux decays exponentially,\nJ \u0001 ae2at , (1)\nwhere the escape rate a is the product of an Arrhenius\nfactor [2] exp\u00012DU\u0003T \u0002 and a preexponential factor that\ndepends only weakly on temperature T , friction G, and the\ndetails of the potential U\u0001q\u0002,\na \u0001 A\u0001T ,G, \u0004U\u0005\u0002 exp\n\u00b5\n2\nDU\nT\n\u2202\n, T \u00f8 DU . (2)\nKramers derived explicit formulas for A in the ultra-\nunderdamped and moderate-to-overdamped limits.\nIn the ensuing developments and generalizations of\nthe Kramers problem [3,4] (see [5] and [6] for some\nrecent developments), there were two activities that are of\npresent relevance. The first was the problem of filling the\n\u201cgap\u201d between the ultra-underdamped and moderate-to-\noverdamped limits of the expressions for the preexponen-\ntial factor A. This activity was crowned by the work by\nMel\u2019nikov [7]. The second activity includes recent studies\n[8,9] of the flux dynamics during a short initial period\nwhile quasiequilibrium in the well is forming.\nThe subject of our paper is the escape flux from a\nmultiwell metastable potential during the period preceding\nthe formation of quasiequilibrium, which takes exponen-\ntially longer than in the single-well case. This will in prac-\ntice be the only relevant time scale for low temperatures\nwhere the quasistationary stage (1) is never attained. We\nemphasize also that our discussion relates to exponentially\nstrong effects rather than just to a (weak) preexponential\nfactor. The results are immediately applicable to inter-\nwell transition rates in stable potentials with more than\ntwo wells, e.g., to rf SQUIDs [10], ionic channels [11],\nand numerous other systems in nature that can be described\nas classical multiwell potential systems subject to a linear\nfriction and white noise.0031-9007\u000300\u000384(12)\u00032556(4)$15.00Figure 1 presents the results of a computer simulation of\nthe escape (first-passage) flux.

Here, Nreset is the overall number\nof resettings, and DN\u0001t\u0002 is the number of escapes during\nthe interval \u0004t, t 1 Dt\u0005 (the escape is defined as a reaching\nql), where Dt is chosen to be much larger than the typical\ninterval between two successive escapes, but much smaller\nthan the characteristic time scales over which the flux (4)\nmay change significantly.\nOne can resolve in Fig. 1(b) three distinct stages: a\nrapid initial growth of J on a time scale tin (related to\nthe formation of quasiequilibrium within the initial well),\nfollowed by a slow decay with a characteristic decay\ntime ts \u00bf tin (related to the formation quasiequilibrium\nbetween wells 1 and 2), and then a yet slower exponential\n(quasistationary) decay with a decay time tqs \u00bf ts\n[where, on the scale of the figure, J\u0001t\u0002 appears constant].\nGiven the hierarchy tin \u00f8 ts \u00f8 tqs, the processes of\ninterattractor [14] transitions may be considered at the\nsecond and third stages as being instantaneous [15] and,\ncorrespondingly, one may readily use the approximation\nof kinetic equations for the well populations Wi , with con-\nstant interattractor transition rates aij .

Coefficients a12,a21 and the quasistationary flux\naqs can be calculated from the Kramers-Melnikov formula\n[4]. Thus, only one of the four aij coefficients needs to be\nfound independently. We choose it to be a13.The theoretical problem of finding a13 is inherently dif-\nficult. The Melnikov method is generally not valid in the\nmultiwell case [4]. Therefore, the method of optimal fluc-\ntuation (see, e.g., [16]) was suggested [17], seeking the\nescape rate in the form\na13 \u0001 Pe\n2Smin\u0003T , (6)\nwhere the action Smin does not depend on T and the de-\npendence of the prefactor P on T is relatively weak.\nIn order to find Smin, one must find the minimum of\ncertain functional [17,18]\nSmin \b Smin\u00011 ! s2\u0002 \u0001 min\u0004q\u0001t\u0002\u0005,ttr \u0001S\u0002 , (7)\nS \b Sttr \u0004q\u0001t\u0002\u0005 \u0001\n1\n4G\nZ ttr\n0\ndt \u0001q\u00a8 1 G \u0002q 1 dU\u0003dq\u00022,\nq\u00010\u0002 \u0001 q1, \u0002q\u00010\u0002 \u0001 0, q\u0001ttr \u0002 \u0001 qs2 , \u0002q\u0001ttr \u0002 \u0001 0 .\nThe trajectory \u0004q\u0001t\u0002\u0005 providing minimal S does not include\nattractor 2.

The MPDTPs s2 ! s1\nare shown by thick dotted lines.2558on G is considered over the whole range of G from very\nstrong damping to the ultra-underdamped case, one can\nresolve three distinct regions of G.\nIn the overdamped region, G $ G0 \u0001 2V2 (where V2\nis the frequency of eigenoscillation in the bottom of well\n2), there is no MPDTP 1 ! s2 at all so that a13 \u0001 0.\nIn the moderate-friction region \u0004G1,G0\u0005, DS\u0001G\u0002 is\nmonotonic and undergoes the largest variation: from 0\nto Us1 2 U2. The MPDTP [see Fig. 3(a)] is the time\nreversal of the trajectory s2 A\u0001A2! s1 nf! 1. The latter is\njust the noise-free relaxation from s1 to 1, whereas the\nformer is the solution of (cf. also [18])\nq\u00a8d 1 G\n1 1 AeGt\n1 2 AeGt\n\u0002qd 1 dU\u0001qd\u0002\u0003dqd \u0001 0 ,\nqd\u00010\u0002 \u0001 qs2 , \u0002qd\u00010\u0002 \u0001 0 ,\n(9)\nwhere A \u0001 A2 is a negative constant providing for the\nminimal S among all values of A for which \u0004qd\u0001t\u0002\u0005 reaches\ns1 [in general, there may be an infinite set of A providing\n\u0004qd\u0001t\u0002\u0005 connecting the saddles: the corresponding trajecto-\nries differ by their number of turning points].\nThe underdamped region, G # G1, is divided by char-\nacteristic values of friction, Gn$1. Each value Gn provides\nfor the noise-free saddle connection s2 nf! s1 and the latter\npossesses n 2 1 turning points. In this region, DS\u0001G\u0002 un-\ndergoes oscillations which correspond to an alternation be-\ntween two situations. In the first, \u0004G2m,G2m21\u0005 \u0001m $ 1\u0002, a\nnoise-free trajectory s2 nf! 1 exists and the MPDTP is just\nits time reversal, with DS \u0001 0. In the second situation,\n\u0004G2m11,G2m\u0005 \u0001m $ 1\u0002, the action varies nonmonotonically\nwith G, and has cusps. This is due to a competition be-\ntween the two paths which are the time reversals, respec-\ntively, of s2\nA2! s1 nf! 1 and s2 A1! s1 nf! 1, where s2 A6! s1\nare given by the solutions of (9) with A1 \b A1\u0001G\u0002 . 0\nand A2 \b A2\u0001G\u0002 , 0, respectively [see Figs. 3(b) and\n3(c), respectively]. As G varies, S along one path be-\ncomes equal to S along another, at a certain G, leading to\nswitching between the paths and to the cusp in DS\u0001G\u0002 (cf.\ndiscontinuities in the nonequilibrium potential [18] and\nfluctuational separatrix [16]).\nThus, [17] predicts an exponentially strong dependence\non friction (including such nontrivial features as oscilla-\ntions and cusps) for the escape rate a13 at t \u00bf tin. To\nestablish whether these (and the properties of MPDTPs\ndescribed above) occur in reality, we have undertaken ana-\nlog electronic [20] and computer [21] simulations. A nec-\nessary condition is smallness of the temperature: T \u00f8\nDS, \u0001Us1 2 U1\u0002. However, to obtain reasonable statistics\nat such a small temperature would require an unrealisti-\ncally long time \u0001~ exp\u0004\u0001Us2 2 U1 1 DS\u0002\u0003T \u0005\u0002 [22]. We\nhave overcome this difficulty by exploiting the property of\ndetailed balance [23], which implies [17] that the MPDTP\ns2 ! 1 is just the time reversal of the MPDTP 1 ! s2,\nwith the corresponding actions differing by Us2 2 U1, i.e.,\nVOLUME 84, NUMBER 12 P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S 20 MARCH 2000DS\u00011 ! s2\u0002 \u0001 Smin\u0001s2 ! 1\u0002\n\u0001\n(\n0 at s2\nnf! 1\nSmin\u0001s2 ! s1\u0002 at s2 nf! 2 , (10)\nso that information about the transition s2 ! 1 is equiva-\nlent to that for 1 ! s2, but the experimental time re-\nquired is of course much smaller in the former case\n\u0004~ exp\u0001DS\u0003T\u0002\u0005 than in the latter.\nFigure 3(a) demonstrates that, for G [ \u0004G1,G0\u0005, most\nof the direct paths s2 ! 1 do indeed concentrate near\ns2\nA2! s1 nf! 1. Figures 3(b) and 3(c) demonstrate switch-\ning of the MPDTP from s2\nA1! s1 nf! 1 to s2 A2! s1 nf! 1 as\nG decreases in the range \u0004G3,G2\u0005.\nIn order to study Smin we use the following technique.\nThe system is put at s2 and then follows its stochastic\ndynamics (3) until either the bottom of one of the wells is\napproached or the coordinate ql is reached. After that, the\nsystem is reset to s2 and the operation is repeated. Once\nadequate statistics have been obtained, we calculate the\nratio of transitions to the wells 1 and 2:\nR \b R\u0001T \u0002 \u0001\nNs2!1\nNs2!2\n. (11)\nIt is easy to see that R ~ exp\u00046Smin\u0001s2 ! s1\u0002\u0003T \u0005 [where\n\u00011,2\u0002 correspond to ranges of G providing s2\nnf! 1, 2,\nrespectively]. So, Smin\u0001s2 ! s1\u0002 is related to R (11) as\n6Smin\u0001s2 ! s1\u0002 \u0001 lim\nT!0\n\tT ln\u0004R\u0001T \u0002\u0005\n , (12)\nwhere \u00011,2\u0002 correspond to s2\nnf! 1, 2, respectively.\nHowever, there is always a lower limit for T in simu-\nlations, Tl , because the overall simulation time must not\nbecome unrealistically long. That is why the use of (12)\nmay, in practice, introduce significant inaccuracy. To re-\nduce the influence of the preexponential factor we measure\nR both at Tl and at a slightly higher temperature, Tl 1 DT\n\u0004Tl \u00bf DT \u0003 T2l \u0003Smin\u0001s2 ! s1\u0002\u0005, so that\n6Smin\u0001s2 ! s1\u0002 \u000b T\n2\nl\nDT\nln\n\u00b5\nR\u0001Tl 1 DT \u0002\nR\u0001Tl\u0002\n\u2202\n.

The agreement is satisfactory (given that\n5 \u0004 Smin\u0003Tl \u0004 7).\nNote that the magnitude of the largest oscillation in ac-\ntion may significantly exceed Us2 2 U1. This occurs if the\ninitial well 1 is adjacent to an external saddle s2 while its\ndepth is much less than that of the other well.\nFinally, we comment on the experimental consequence\nof the cutoff of the MPDTP, namely, the drastic change\nof the time evolution of J for tin \u0004 t \u00f8 ts: at G , G0,\none may, in principle, make T small enough that the sharp\ngrowth of J\u0001t\u0002 at t \u0004 tin turns into a nearly constant value\nat tin \u00f8 t \u00f8 tina13\u0003\u0001a12a23\u0002, while, at G .

But\nit is not in fact crucial for the flux on the relevant time\nscale t \u00bf tin [see (5)] that the initial state should be at the\nbottom: the only restriction is that the initial state should\nlie within a particular well (e.g., well 1).\n[13] The choice of ql , tl is quite arbitrary: ql may be chosen be-\ntween qs2 \u000b 3.8 and q3 \u000b 5.3, where q3 is the coordinate\nof the local minimum in U\u02dc\u0001q\u0002 \u0001 0.06\u0001q 1 1.5\u00022 2 cos\u0001q\u0002\nto the right from s2; tl is to greatly exceed ts [see (5)] which\nis equal to \u000b112 for the given set of parameters.\n[14] For brevity, we refer to region 3 also as an \u201cattractor.\u201d\n[15] M.
