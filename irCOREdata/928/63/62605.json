Wet-only samplers, which open only during \nprecipitation, avoid this problem, but can be bulky (leading to disruption of air flow \nand droplet collection) and need electrical power. We describe here a simple battery-\npowered modification to a standard bulk sampler that allows the separate \nmeasurement of deposition to the funnel surface and wet deposition by washing the \nfunnel surface when precipitation is detected. Comparison of this design with a \nstandard bulk sampler over 3 months at a site in eastern Scotland showed that dry \ndeposition to the funnel surface contributed around 20% of sulphate, 20-30% of \nnitrate and 20-40% of ammonium ions. There was also a significant loss of \nammonium and nitrate in the modified sampler, presumably in the tubing, even \nthough a biocide had been added to the sample bottles. This observation has \nimplications for bulk samplers of similar design, with a sample bottle at ground level. \nDeposition of sea salts and calcium was greater to the flushing collectors than to the \nbulk collectors, implying that regular cleaning of funnel surfaces with 10% methanol \nsolution subtly alters the capture efficiency for larger particles.\nIntroduction\nMeasurements of the chemical composition of precipitation have been made for \nseveral decades using a variety of sampling methods. The simplest \u2018bulk\u2019 collector \nconsists of a funnel (glass or plastic) connected to a sampling bottle, which may be \nchanged daily, weekly or even monthly. This system is simple and does not require \nelectrical power. However, the continuously-open sampling funnel is prone to \n\u2018contamination\u2019 by the dry deposition of gases and particles which are washed into \nthe sample bottle and included in the precipitation sample. Consequently, several \ntypes of \u2018wet-only\u2019 collector have been devised, which are supplied with a lid which \nopens when precipitation is detected, and closes at the end of a precipitation event. \nCommercial designs may also included refrigeration of the samples to minimise \nlosses caused by microbial activity. Such samplers require electrical power to operate \nthe lid and cooling systems, and are often physically bulky compared to a simple \nfunnel, leading to changes in air flow around the sampler and systematic under-\nsampling of precipitation amount, particularly at high wind speeds, which may also \nbias the sample concentration. In any study of precipitation composition, the \nrequirements, advantages and deficiencies of \u2018wet-only collectors have to be weighed \nagainst the low cost and ease of operation of bulk samplers, especially at remote sites \nwhere wet deposition may have detrimental effects on ecosystems.\nThe factors involved in effective operation of bulk samplers have been reviewed \nrecently 1, including a summary of comparisons between \u2018wet-only\u2019 samplers and \nbulk samplers. The review indicates that differences in flow distortion are likely to \nplay the largest role in causing differences between bulk and wet-only collectors, and \nJournal of Environmental Monitoring (2009), 11, 353-358: DOI: 10.1039\/B813812E\nPublished on web 31\/10\/08\nalso identifies some properties of \u2018wet-only\u2019 samplers that may lead to unexpected \nbias in concentrations caused by retention and subsequent evaporation of water from \nthe sampling funnel. Another recent review 2 cites 9 studies where direct comparisons \nof \u2018wet-only\u2019 and bulk samplers have been made. In most cases, the deposition of \nmaterial to the bulk collectors is significantly greater than to the \u2018wet-only\u2019 collectors, \nwith the exception of free acidity (H+) and ammonium (NH4+) which are often less in \nsamples from bulk collectors than \u2018wet-only\u2019 collectors. In regional or national \nnetworks for precipitation chemistry, where cost or logistics prevent the widespread \ndeployment of \u2018wet-only\u2019 samplers, bulk samplers have been used, accepting that \nthere will be an uncertainty in the results caused by dry deposition to the collector \nsurface. The magnitude of this uncertainty can be gauged to some extent by direct \ncomparison of \u2018wet-only\u2019 and bulk collectors, but where bulk collectors have to be \nused, it would be helpful to be able to quantify the contribution of dry deposition to \nthe actual bulk collector directly. \nSeveral studies have attempted to quantify dry deposition by rinsing funnels on days \nwithout rain 3, or by examining the process under controlled conditions using known \nair concentrations of potential contaminants 4. However, neither approach captured \nthe likely contribution to integrated bulk samples over typical sampling periods of a \nweek or more. This study describes the design and implementation of a novel \n\u2018flushing\u2019 sampler that separately collects funnel washings and \u2018clean\u2019 rain for \nsubsequent chemical analysis and quantification.\nDesign \nConventional \u2018wet-only\u2019 collectors use a lid to prevent dry deposition to the funnel \nsurface between rain events. Some designs use a \u2018dry bucket\u2019 which is covered during \nrainfall, then rinsed and analysed to estimate dry deposition between rain events. \nHowever, the surfaces of the \u2018dry bucket\u2019 are not exposed to wetting, and therefore \nmay saturate (in terms of surface adsorption), and will have very different \ncharacteristics from the surface of a bulk collector which is intermittently wetted by \nrain. In order to make a direct comparison with the standard bulk collector used in the \nUK \u2018Acid deposition\u2019 network 5, a standard collector with a low density polyethylene \n(LDPE) funnel diameter 152 mm leading directly to a high density polyethylene \n(HDPE) sample bottle, at 1.5m above ground (Just Plastics Ltd, UK) has been \nmodified to include a mechanism which rinses the funnel surface when rain is \ndetected. A sketch of the design is shown in Figure 1; rainfall is detected using a \nconventional unheated surface wetness sensor (Campbell Scientific) mounted at 45\u00b0 \nto the vertical. When rain is detected, a solution of 10% methanol in deionised water \nis pumped from a storage reservoir using a 12V DC pump (similar to a car windscreen \nwasher pump) through a spray nozzle mounted on stainless steel rods immediately \nabove the centre of the funnel. A spray duration of 5 seconds (ca. 20 ml) is adequate \nto wet the funnel surface. The funnel washings are directed through a motorised PTFE \n3-way valve to a sample bottle at the foot of the collector through silicone rubber \ntubing enclosed in an opaque flexible hose to exclude light. After 50 seconds the \nvalve rotates so that subsequent rainfall is directed to a second sample bottle for the \nduration of the rain event. Once the surface wetness sensor dries, the valve returns to \nthe original sampling position. A delay time of 120 minutes is built into the \nmechanism so that the valve remains open for rainfall collection during intermittent \nJournal of Environmental Monitoring (2009), 11, 353-358: DOI: 10.1039\/B813812E\nPublished on web 31\/10\/08\nrainfall. The instrument operates on 12V DC from a lead-acid battery and so may be \noperated at sites remote from mains electrical power.\nFigure 1 near here\nMethanol is added to the spray solution to reduce surface tension (improve wetting) \nand inhibit microbial activity. Both sample bottles (for \u2018washings\u2019 and \u2018rain\u2019) are pre-\nloaded with thymol (5-methyl-2-(1-methylethyl)phenol) to provide a minimum \nsolution concentration of 50 mg litre-1 for a full bottle, sufficient to prevent biological \ndegradation of labile nitrogen compounds during sampling 6, 7. For this study samples \nwere taken every 7 days, for direct comparison with the standard UK bulk rainfall \ncollector, to which was added a \u2018dummy\u2019 spray head so that any differential capture \nof fine droplets would be similar for both designs (see Figure 1). Six collectors (3 \nstandard UK bulk collectors with dummy spray heads, and 3 flushing collectors) were \nset out in a gravelled area 5m x 7m in a grass field within the grounds of CEH \nEdinburgh, in south-east Scotland (Lat 55:51:44N, Long 3:12:20W). After several \nmonths of method development and testing of the sampler design, direct comparison \nof the bulk and flushing collectors started on 15 June 2006 and continued until 5 \nOctober 2006. A recording tipping bucket rain gauge was also installed at the site, to \nprovide information on when rainfall occurred, and the duration of individual rain \nevents, where an \u2018event\u2019 is defined as a period during which the tipping bucket rain \ngauge gave non-zero readings in consecutive hours.\nSample volumes were measured gravimetrically each week, and concentrations of \nmajor ions (excluding H+) were measured using ion chromatography (Metrohm). \nDetection limits for the individual ions were typically 2 \u00b5M or less. Samples of the \nflushing solution (10% methanol in water) were also analysed \u2013 the only ion \nconcentrations measured that were above the detection limits were for Ca2+ (average \n3.5 \u00b5M), and \u2018washings\u2019 data have been corrected for this contribution from the \nwashing solution. Data from samples with obvious contamination (e.g. from birds) or \nfrom samples with high NH4+ and K+ concentrations (also indicative of bird \ncontamination) were discarded. If only one sample from a triplicate set was \ncontaminated, data were estimated from the average of the other 2 samples. During \nthe sampling period of 16 weeks, 4 weeks had insufficient rainfall for a sample, and in \none week almost all samplers were contaminated, leaving a total of 11 weekly \nsamples for statistical analysis. In weeks with insufficient rainfall, collectors were \ncleaned as usual, and sampling bottles were replaced.\nIn order to estimate the relative contribution to deposition in the washings and in the \nrain, the total amount of material deposited in each sample was calculated from the \nproduct of the volume and concentration, to give deposition as micromoles m-2 wk-1. \nMeasured air concentrations of trace gases and particles close to the sampling site \nwere extracted from the database of the UK Nitric Acid monitoring network, which is \noperated by CEH (http:\/\/www.cara.ceh.ac.uk\/hno3network\/index.html).\nStatistical analysis\nData are presented in the following tables and figures as the weekly mean deposition, \nwith variability expressed as the standard deviation of data from the 3 independent \ncollectors of each type. In theory, the sum of the deposition in the washings and the \nJournal of Environmental Monitoring (2009), 11, 353-358: DOI: 10.1039\/B813812E\nPublished on web 31\/10\/08\nrain should equal the deposition to the bulk collector. In order to test this, data were \nanalysed by two-way analysis of variance, using sample date and collector type as \nvariates, with triplicate data from the independent collectors.\nResults\nWater\nThere was a small (4%) but statistically significant difference between the amounts of \nwater collected by the bulk collector and the flushing collector (Table 1), with the \nsmaller volumes from the flushing collector. This finding confirmed data obtained \nduring the development of the equipment, when the 6 collectors (3 bulk, 3 flushing) \nwere exposed between March and May 2006 without the mechanism in operation \u2013 \ni.e. with the valve fixed in one position. Under these conditions, the average weekly \nvolume collected in the bulk collectors was 266 \u00b1 8 ml, compared with 254 \u00b1 2 ml  in \nthe continuously open flushing collectors (each with 3 collectors, 7 weekly samples), \na difference of 5%. The difference between the two sets of collectors, which have \nsimilar geometry and therefore should have caused the same flow distortion, may \nresult from some trapping of water in the valve (mounted immediately below the \nfunnel, Figure 1) in the flushing collector at the end of each rain event, and the \nsubsequent evaporation of small volumes of water. The volume involved is small, \nequivalent to 1.5 ml per rain event. There was no evidence of water leakage from the \ncontinuously open flushing collectors. Consequently, the smaller volumes observed \nfrom the flushing collector relative to the bulk collector between June and October \n2006 are most likely caused by the same mechanism, rather than because some of the \nrain was sampled into the \u2018washings\u2019 sample bottle before the valve operated.\nSea-salts\nSodium, chloride and magnesium data show a small but significantly greater overall \ndeposition (washings + rain) to the flushing collector than to the bulk collector (Table \n1), despite the smaller volume of water collected as rain by the flushing collector. \nMore importantly, the data show that approximately one-third of the sea-salt \ndeposition measured in the bulk collector was contributed from dry-deposited material \non the funnel surface, recovered as the funnel washings in the flushing collector. \nCalcium and potassium\nThere was a large (50%) excess deposition of calcium to the flushing collectors \ncompared to the bulk collectors (Table 1), and half of this was observed in the \u2018rain\u2019 \ncomponent, suggesting that the 5 second flushing with the 10% methanol\/water \nsolution was not completely effective in removing surface-deposited material. \nConsequently, the overall contribution of dry deposition from washings of between 20 \nand 30% of the total (Table 1) is probably an underestimate. Potassium data were \noften close to the limit of detection and showed large variation across samplers, so \nthat no significant difference was observed between sampler types.\nSulphate\nThere was no significant difference in the deposition of sulphate, either as total \nsulphate or non-sea sulphate (estimated using the sodium:sulphate ratio in sea water), \nbetween the bulk and flushing collectors. However, the contribution of dry deposition \nestimated from the funnel washings (Table 1) was around 20% of the total. Part of this \nmay have arisen from sulphate particles and part from gaseous sulphur dioxide. \nJournal of Environmental Monitoring (2009), 11, 353-358: DOI: 10.1039\/B813812E\nPublished on web 31\/10\/08\nAverage air concentrations over the 3 months July-September 2006 measured \napproximately 200m from the sampling site (http:\/\/www.cara.ceh.ac.uk\/hno3network\/\nindex.html) were 1.0 \u00b5g SO42- m-3 and 0.97 \u00b5g SO2 m-3. The estimated dry deposition \nof non-sea sulphate of 0.09 mmole m-2 wk-1 (Table 1) therefore corresponds to a \ndeposition velocity to the collector of 0.01 m s-1 if all from SO2, or 0.015 m s-1 if all \nfrom particulate SO42-.\nNitrate\nThe most notable feature of the nitrate data is the overall large loss of nitrate in the \nflushing collector (washing + rain) compared with the bulk collector (Table 1). As a \nbiocide was added to the sample bottles prior to deployment, the losses must have \noccurred in the 1.5 m lengths of silicone rubber tubing leading from the valve to the \nstorage bottles, even though the tubing and bottles were kept in the dark. The standard \nsample funnel leads directly into the sample bottle, so collected precipitation would \nhave been protected immediately by the biocide. Nevertheless, a significant fraction \n(20-30%, Table 1) of the nitrate sampled was in the washings, suggesting that dry \ndeposition on the surface of the bulk collector constitutes a large proportion of the \nmeasured nitrate deposition. Gaseous nitric acid and particulate nitrate concentrations \nover the 3 months were 0.9 \u00b5g HNO3 m-3 and 1.2 \u00b5g NO3- m-3. The measured \ndeposition in washings of 0.15 mmole m-2 wk-1 (Table 1) represents a lower bound \n(given the loss of total nitrate) to the dry deposition, and corresponds to a deposition \nvelocity to the collector of 0.018 m s-1 if all from HNO3, or 0.013 m s-1 if all from \nparticulate NO3-.\nAmmonium\nAs for nitrate, almost half of the ammonium measured in the bulk collectors was lost \nfrom the washings + rain measured in the flushing collectors, again presumably \nthrough biological activity in the sample tubing. However, the washings contributed \nup to 40% of the sampled ammonium, indicating a significant contribution from dry \ndeposition, of at least 0.21 mmole m-2 wk-1 (Table 1). Gaseous ammonia and \nparticulate ammonium concentrations over the 3 months were 1.8 \u00b5g NH3 m-3 and 0.9 \n\u00b5g NH4+ m-3. The measured deposition in washings represents a lower bound (given \nthe loss of total ammonium) to the dry deposition, and corresponds to a deposition \nvelocity to the collector of 0.003 m s-1 if all from NH3, or 0.007 m s-1 if all from \nparticulate NH4+.\nTable 1 near here\nDiscussion\nThere have been many studies comparing adjacent bulk and wet-only precipitation \ncollectors, in many parts of the world. Most of the key research up to 2003 was \nsummarized recently 2, and subsequent studies 8-11 come to similar conclusions:\n1. the difference between bulk and wet-only samplers is very dependent on location \n(rural, suburban, urban) 12 and surrounding terrain (arid, grassland)2;\n2. soil-derived ions from large wind-blown particles such as Ca2+, Mg2+, K+ and \nsometimes SO42-, or sea-salt ions (Na+, Cl-) show much larger enhancements than \nfor ions derived from gases or sub-micron particles (NH4+, NO3-, SO42-);\n3. longer sampling periods (e.g. week vs. day) show greater enhancements 10, 11, 13;\nJournal of Environmental Monitoring (2009), 11, 353-358: DOI: 10.1039\/B813812E\nPublished on web 31\/10\/08\n4. sampler design is an important factor controlling the chemical composition of the \nprecipitation sample i.e. different designs give different results 10, 14;\n5. there can be large spatial variability over a small area if replicate samplers are \ndeployed (which is not often the case) 14.\nThis study is unique in several respects. Firstly, the novel design of the \u2018flushing\u2019 \ngauge permits a more accurate assessment of the contribution of dry deposition to the \ncollector surface of a bulk collector than the use of an adjacent \u2018dry bucket\u2019 as used in \nsome designs 15. The physical and chemical characteristics of the flushing gauge were \nidentical in respect of the collecting surface; only the subsequent tubing and sample \nstorage was different. Moreover, a biocide was used to minimise biological \ndegradation in the stored sample, as has been used in some comparison studies 11, but \nis not usual. Secondly, the use of multiple replicates of both types of collector within \na small area has permitted an assessment to be made of the spatial and temporal \nuncertainties arising from the use of such collectors, which in general are not \nadequately represented, with experiments comparing only one example of each type \nof \u2018co-located\u2019collector. \nThe results confirmed the general pattern of the greater enhancements in bulk \ndeposition of ions associated with large particles (Ca2+ and sea salts), and small \ndifferences for SO42-. The complication arising from loss of N-containing ions in the \nflushing sampler precluded a direct comparison of the two types of collector, but it is \nnotable that in some studies the deposition of NH4+ to bulk samplers is reported as less \nthan to wet-only samplers 2. It is possible that in these cases any dry-deposited NH3 or \nNH4+ was more susceptible to biological degradation in a continuously-open sampler \nthan in a lidded wet-only sampler, and therefore showed lower collected amounts \neven though actual deposition may have been higher to the bulk sampler. \nDry deposition to the surface of the UK standard bulk precipitation collector at this \nsite over 3 months contributed a significant proportion of the input of material \nrecorded in solution, varying between 20% (for sulphate) and 40% (for ammonium). \nThere is some uncertainty in the proportion of nitrogen-containing ions that are \ndeposited through dry deposition, because of losses in the flushing sampler, but the \namounts recovered from the washings clearly indicate a substantial contribution of \ndry deposition to the total.\nPrevious attempts at quantifying dry deposition to bulk collectors at this site relied on \nlaboratory experiments or manual rinsing of funnels on days without rainfall. The \nearly studies using manual funnel washings 3 suggested a contribution to sulphate \nfrom dry deposition of 22%, similar to the proportion observed in this study, despite \nthe difference in time (1977 vs. 2006), funnel surface (Pyrex glass vs. HDPE), and air \nconcentrations at the site (5.7 \u00b5g SO42- m-3 and 23 \u00b5g SO2 m-3 in 1977, compared with \n1.0 \u00b5g SO42- m-3 and 0.97 \u00b5g SO2 m-3 in 2006). The later process-based studies 4 using \ncontrolled exposure of UK standard bulk collector funnels (HDPE) to SO2 and NH3 \nindicated a contribution from dry deposition of SO2 to dry funnels of 85-120 nmole \nfunnel-1 d-1, equivalent to 0.03 to 0.05 mmole m-2 wk-1 (cf. average washing of 0.09 \nmmole m-2 wk-1, Table 1). That study also showed dry deposition of NH3 to dry \nfunnels between 70 and 120 nmole funnel-1 d-1 (0.03 to 0.05 mmole m-2 wk-1), with \ndeposition to wet funnels a factor of 5 greater, compared with the average deposition \nmeasured in washings in this study of 0.21 mmole m-2 wk-1 (Table 1).\nJournal of Environmental Monitoring (2009), 11, 353-358: DOI: 10.1039\/B813812E\nPublished on web 31\/10\/08\nThe assumption made above is that the washings may be directly related to material \ndry-deposited on funnel surfaces between rain events. However, there may also be \nsome contribution from the early part of rainfall, during the first minute after rainfall \nis detected and before the valve changes position. Sequential sampling of rainfall \ncomposition often shows a high initial concentration 16, 17, although ensuring a clean \nsampler at the exact start of a rain event is practically very difficult to achieve. \nHowever, a similar problem would be seen for conventional wet-only samplers, where \nthe initial rainfall that triggers opening of the lid may not actually be captured 14. \nThere was no evidence from comparing water sampling rates that a significant \nfraction of water was diverted to the washings at the start of a rain event, rather than \nto the rain sample bottle. \nAs noted above, the consistently lower sampling (by 4-5%) of water by the flushing \ngauge may be caused by retention and subsequent evaporation of rain in the valve \nassembly. Any soluble material (at most 4-5%) retained in the valve at the end of each \nrain event would be flushed into the washings at the start of the next event and be \nrecorded as \u2018dry deposition\u2019. Consequently there may be a systematic positive bias in \nestimated dry deposition of up to 5% of the total deposited. Set against this, we have \nassumed that the 5-second washing process completely removes all dry-deposited \nmaterial from the funnel surface. In practice the evidence suggests that for calcium, at \nleast, the process is not completely efficient, leading to a potential negative bias in the \nmeasurements.\nThe data for ammonium and nitrate highlight the difficulties of studying labile species \neven when precautions have been taken to prevent biological activity during \nsampling. Further measurements have been made and will be reported in a subsequent \npaper. However, the message is clear, even if the size of the bias is not well defined \n(24-44% for ammonium, 17-30% for nitrate). There are also implications for \nmeasurement systems where collector funnels are mounted at 1.5 m and connected to \nsampling bottles at ground level by tubing 1, even when the bottles are kept in the dark \nand refrigerated or protected using a biocide. It is not clear whether different tubing \nmaterials (e.g. PTFE) would lead to smaller losses of labile compounds.\nThe reason for the greater deposition rates of particles (sea-salts, calcium) to the \nflushing collector than to the bulk collector is not immediately apparent. In principle, \nthe geometry and materials of both types of collector are identical. The only \ndifference is that the funnel surfaces of the flushing gauge are regularly washed with \n10% methanol\/water solution, which may change the pattern of surface wetting and \nthe capacity of the funnel surface to retain wind-borne particles.\nConclusions\nThe development of a novel design of precipitation collector has permitted the \nestimation of dry deposition to a standard bulk collector as used in the UK national \nprecipitation network. The results indicate significant positive bias in reporting bulk \nrainfall composition relative to the likely actual composition of rainfall, at least over a \n3-month period at one site. The data are also consistent with earlier measurements of \ndry deposition to bulk rainfall collectors at this site in eastern Scotland. \nJournal of Environmental Monitoring (2009), 11, 353-358: DOI: 10.1039\/B813812E\nPublished on web 31\/10\/08\nThe implications of these results for the UK bulk precipitation monitoring network are \nimportant: it would appear that wet deposition of S and N to the UK is being \noverestimated by an undefined amount, but possibly of the order of 20 to 40%. The \nextent of the dry deposition to the collectors will vary spatially, depending on the air \nconcentrations of the contributory gases and particles. However, as discussed in the \nearlier paper 4, the average deposition velocities calculated above for this site over 3 \nmonths are unlikely to be directly applicable to other sites and times of year, because \nof the variation of dry deposition rates with surface wetting. For a full assessment of \nthe likely bias across the UK it would be necessary to install similar collectors at all \nthe UK network sites.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors acknowledge financial support from the UK Department of the \nEnvironment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) under contract RMP2258, and the help \nof David Benham (CEH Lancaster) in designing the circuitry and building the \nflushing rain collectors.\nReferences\n1.
