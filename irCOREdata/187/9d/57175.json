Hot springs (~100\u00b0C) near to the volcanic crater \ndischarge alkaline waters instead of the more commonly recognised acidic fluids. \n2 \nThe hydrothermal system of Savo dominantly discharges sinter and travertine-forming \nalkaline sulphate (pH 7\u20138) waters at hot springs on its upper flanks, in addition to a small \nnumber of lower discharge acid sulphate springs (pH 2\u20137). Alkaline sulphate springs \ndischarge dilute, chloride-poor (<50 mg\/l), sulphate- (>600 mg\/l) and silica-rich (>250 mg\/l) \nfluids. They have restricted \u03b434SSO4 (5.4 \u00b1 1.5\u2030) and \u03b418OH2O values (\u22124\u2030; local non-\nthermal groundwater is \u22128\u2030).

They also display high \n\u03b418OH2O and \u03b4DH2O relative to non-thermal groundwater. \nGeochemical modelling shows that water\u2013rock reaction and dilution in the presence of \nsecondary anhydrite, pyrite and quartz leads to chloride being diluted to low concentrations, \nwhilst maintaining high sulphate and silica concentrations in the fluid. Strontium, oxygen and \nhydrogen isotopes confirm water\u2013rock reaction and mixing with groundwater as primary \ncontrols on the composition of the alkaline sulphate springs. \nThe highly unusual dilute chemistry of all discharges at Savo is a consequence of high \nregional rainfall, i.e. climatic control, and results from open system mixing at depth between \nhydrothermal and meteoric waters. \n1 Introduction \nStudies of active magmatic-hydrothermal systems (e.g. Delmelle et al., 2000; Giggenbach et \nal., 2003) typically identify acid fluids discharging from springs in close proximity to the \ncentre of hydrothermal activity. Fluids of higher pH in stratovolcano-hosted systems (near-\nneutral chloride type; Ellis and Mahon, 1977) are discharged as lateral outflows some \nconsiderable distance from the centre of activity (Henley and Ellis, 1983). However, near-\ncrater (<1 km) hot springs on Savo, Solomon Islands, discharge high pH (7\u20138) sulphate-rich, \n3 \nlow-chloride fluids which precipitate silica sinter and mixed silica\u2013carbonate deposits. \nAlthough acid springs do occur, the alkaline springs dominate in terms of number, discharge \nrate and longevity. The abundance of alkaline springs in an environment that might \nreasonably be expected to be dominated by acidic fluids (either as volcanic condensate \ndischarges, or steam-heated springs) is highly unusual, as is the low-chloride content of the \nfluids.  \nHere we present chemical and stable isotope analyses of fluids from the Savo hydrothermal \nsystem, and undertake geochemical modelling to examine the sources and history of the \nfluids, and elucidate the importance of processes such as water-rock reaction and fluid mixing \nin generating these anomalous alkaline sulphate fluids.  \n2 Background \n2.1 Geology and Tectonic Setting of Savo \nThe Solomon Islands were formed by the ongoing convergence of the Indo-Australian and \nPacific plates (Fig. 1). Southward subduction of the Pacific plate at the North Solomon \nTrench System commenced in the Eocene, and continued until the thickened lithosphere of \nthe Ontong Java Plateau eventually \u201cchoked\u201d the trench, resulting in a change of subduction \npolarity (Petterson et al., 1999). Northward subduction of the Indo-Australian Plate at the \nSouth Solomon Trench System began at around 6 Ma (Phinney et al., 2004). Partial melting \nof young oceanic crust of the Indo-Australian Plate beneath the Solomon Arc exerts a strong \ncontrol on erupted magma chemistry (Johnson et al., 1987; K\u00f6nig et al., 2007). Metasomatic \nenrichment of the mantle wedge by the stalled Pacific slab has been suggested to be an \nimportant control on the composition of magmas in Papua New Guinea (McInnes et al., 2001; \nM\u00fcller et al., 2001; Richards et al., 1990), and may also be significant for magma generation \nin the Solomon Islands. \n4 \nSavo (Fig. 1), 35 km northwest of the Solomon Islands capital Honiara, is a dormant \nstratovolcano. It rises approximately 1500 m from the seafloor, with the upper 485 m \nemergent above sea level. The centre of the island is marked by a 1.5 km diameter crater. \nHistorical Merapi-type eruptions have been recorded in 1568, 1830\u201340, and inferred at 1630\u2013\n1670 AD (Grover, 1958; Petterson et al., 2003), forming volcaniclastic deposits (block-and-\nash-flow deposits and fluvially reworked equivalents), with lava domes in the crater and \nsouth of the island, subsequently heavily vegetated. Erupted rock compositions are dominated \nby silica-saturated (hypersthene to quartz-normative) sodic trachytes (plagioclase + \nhornblende + biotite + magnetite; silica-saturated, quartz-absent) and mugearites (plagioclase \n+ clinopyroxene + magnetite \u00b1 hornblende \u00b1 olivine; Smith et al., 2009).  \n2.2 Major Thermal Areas of Savo  \nHot springs (60\u2013100\u00b0C) and steaming ground occur on the upper flanks of the volcano (Fig. \n1). The crater has no hot springs, but fumaroles (<120\u00b0C) and steaming ground are present. \nThermal areas have a strong odour of H2S, and native sulphur precipitates at higher \ntemperature steam and gas outlets. Inland cold springs (<30\u00b0C) are rare on Savo. Most \ngroundwater-recharged wells in the coastal villages are noticeably warm, between 30\u201340\u00b0C. \nMost springs are hosted in poorly consolidated volcaniclastic deposits. To investigate the \nhydrothermal system at Savo, two field campaigns (April\u2013May 2005; September\u2013October \n2006) were carried out.  \n2.2.1 Eastern Springs \u2013 Rembokola  \nAn approximately 10 m2 area of boiling pH 7\u20138 springs occurs in the upper reaches of the \nRembokola stream (Fig. 1), on relatively flat ground within the steep-sided valley \napproximately 1 km from the crater rim. The springs are small pools (<0.5 m diameter) \nemptying via small channels into the main stream channel. Spring flow rates vary over \n5 \ntimescales of a few minutes, and individual springs discharge at rates of less than1 kg\/s. The \nRembokola stream is dominated by thermal water contributions in the upstream part of the \ncatchment resulting in water temperatures up to 80\u00b0C. Combined discharge from the springs \nwas approximately 10\u201350 kg\/s (susceptible to variations in rainfall and spring flow rate). \nWhite siliceous sinter forms a crust over much of the streambed and sediments adjacent to the \nhot springs. \n2.2.2 Crater Wall Springs \u2013 Poghorovorughala  \nThe Crater Wall is the largest and most vigorous of the hydrothermal areas, with springs, \nspouters and fumaroles. It is in the upper reaches of the Poghorovorughala stream (Fig. 1), in \nthe south of the island. The area extends approximately 200 m along the steep-sided valley \nfrom the crater rim, with less than 30 m lateral extent from the stream. \nThere is extensive fumarolic ground at the Crater Wall area, particularly on the northern side \nof the stream valley. This is marked by kaolinite and abundant native sulphur at the surface \nand black pyrite-bearing mud beneath. Boiling alkaline hot springs (pH 7\u20138) are common, \nboth pools within small depressions and as spouters on the valley wall, and in the stream bed \n(marked by bubbling and boiling water as they discharge into the stream). There are a small \nnumber of mud pots, and some small spouters. Many of the springs produce unusual \ncarbonate + opal-A + anhydrite deposits, as both layered and rounded (lobate) structures \nsurrounding springs and spouters. Many of the springs identified in 2005 were still active in \n2006, although some had deposited sufficient travertine to block the conduits, thus greatly \nreducing discharge. For unblocked springs, discharge rates were similar to those of the \nEastern area, estimated to be 0.1\u20131 kg\/s. The combined discharge of the springs is similar to \nthat of the Eastern area (10\u201350 kg\/s). \n6 \nAcid hot springs also occur in the Crater Wall area, but in contrast to the alkaline sulphate \nsprings, the acid hot springs are destructive, and lie within cavities. These springs typically \nhave very low water discharges (on the order of 0.001\u20130.010 kg\/s) although vigorous \nbubbling indicates significant gas discharge rates. These springs were not persistent features \nover the two sampling periods. \n2.2.3 Reoka \nThe Reoka hydrothermal field is an area (approximately 50 m2) of hot springs and fumaroles \non the flat ground in the lower reaches of the Reoka stream (Fig. 1). Ground and hot spring \ntemperatures are typically 100\u00b0C. At the surface, advanced argillic alteration (kaolinite with \nminor alunite) is widespread, with grey pyrite-bearing mud found up to 30 cm below. In \n2005, acid hot springs (pH 2\u20135) occurred as pools within depressions within the thermal area. \nThe springs were isolated from the stream, and had very low discharge rates (<0.010 kg\/s). \nLandslides occurred in 2006, burying large portions of the area including a number of springs \nand the original stream channel. In 2006, the springs in the Reoka area flowed into the stream \n(unlike in 2005), although during rainfall, the stream overflowed into the spring depressions.  \n2.2.4 Tanginakulu \nTanginakulu is a warm stream (28\u201335\u00b0C) fed by small, low discharge springs (~0.001 kg\/s) at \n45\u201350\u00b0C. Travertine deposits occur for much of the stream\u2019s length, and range from thin \nveneers cementing clasts on the stream bed, to >10 cm thick beds of travertine. No high \ntemperature thermal areas occur within the Tanginakulu catchment.  \n7 \n3 Sampling and Analytical Methods \n3.1 Water Chemistry \nWater samples were collected directly from springs and from large containers of freshly \ncollected well water. The water was pumped through a <0.45 \u03bcm in-line PTFE syringe filter \nusing silicone tubing and a hand vacuum pump. To ensure all equipment was free from \ncontamination by previous samples, approximately 150 ml of sample water was pumped and \ndiscarded three times before collecting the actual sample. pH was determined in the field \nfrom filtered and cooled (~50\u00b0C) samples using digital pH meters with automatic temperature \ncompensation (Hanna Instruments HI98128 and 991001). For hot springs, pH was corrected \nto spring temperature (pHC) using SOLVEQ (Reed, 1982; Reed and Spycher, 1984), by \ninputting measured fluid compositions (using estimated HCO3\u2212 contents where necessary) \nand re-equilibrating to the higher discharge temperature. No gas analysis was available to \nrecombine into the water. Corrections are small, generally resulting in changes of <0.2 pH \nunits. Additionally, a small number of pH measurements were made in situ \u2013 there was no \nappreciable pH difference between the in situ pH measurements and the pHC values. \nDissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) content was determined in the field on filtered samples by \ntitration; pH was adjusted to 8.3 by addition of NaOH, then titrated to pH 3.8 using a Hach\u00ae \nDigital Titrator with sulphuric acid to determine the volume of acid required to convert all \ndissolved bicarbonate to CO2. Titrations were repeated until three results within 5% were \nobtained. Purging of CO2 and back titration was not possible. Results were corrected for \ninterference from SiO2 and B, following Arn\u00f3rsson (2000). Bisulphide (HS\u2212) analysis was \nnot performed, and this species may provide interference for the titration, resulting in slight \nover-estimation of total carbonate for alkaline fluids. Results are expressed as mg\/l HCO3\u2212 \nequivalent, although for acidic fluids (pH <3.8) values likely represent dissolved CO2. \n8 \nFor each sample, an unacidified fraction for anion determination was decanted into a 28 ml \nHDPE bottle. A fraction for cation determination was collected in a 28 ml HDPE bottle and \nacidified by addition of 0.3 ml Tracepur\u00ae 69% HNO3 (samples SV197\u2013SV213 acidified with \n1 ml). \nAll laboratory-based analyses were carried out at the British Geological Survey at Keyworth, \nUK, a UKAS accredited laboratory that participates in the Aquacheck proficiency testing \nscheme. Analyses conform to ISO 17025. \nMajor and trace elements, including total sulphur, were determined using a Fisons\/ARL3580 \nICP-AES with Gilson 222 Autosampler, using procedures described in Ault et al. (1999). \nSamples for ICP-AES were diluted by fivefold (2005) or twofold (2006) using 1% Aristar\u00ae \ngrade HNO3 to avoid solids precipitating in the nebuliser. A subset of trace elements was \nanalysed by VG Elemental PQ ExCell quadrupole ICP-MS for 2006 samples using \nprocedures outlined in Cook et al. (2002). Accuracy and precision were determined from \nrepeat analysis of quality control solutions over a period of 12 months, and are summarised in \nthe supplementary data. Detection limits differ between instruments and samples due to \ndifferent dilutions, and are summarised in the results tables where appropriate. \nAnions were determined using a Dionex DX-600 Ion Chromatograph system with ED50A \nElectrochemical Detector and AD20 Absorbance Detector modules, using procedures \noutlined in Charlton et al. (2003). Precision of IC data (based on long term quality control \nsolution data, with >500 analyses) is F\u2212 =3%; Cl\u2212 =5%; NO2\u2212 =3%; NO3\u2212 =4%; Br\u2212 =2%; \nand HPO4\u2212 =4%. Accuracy (difference between mean and target value) determined from the \nAquacheck proficiency testing scheme was 0.8% for F\u2212, 0.6% for NO2\u2212, 0.4% for Br\u2212, 0.3% \nfor HPO4\u2212, \u22121.3% for NO3\u2212, and 3% for Cl\u2212. \n9 \nComparison of SO42\u2212 as determined by ICP-AES (as total sulphur; SO42\u2212 should be the \ndominant species in acidified samples) and IC showed significant discrepancy between the \ntwo techniques, particularly for 2006 hot springs, with SO42\u2212 concentrations lower when \ndetermined by IC. Sulphate content was also measured by gravimetry of barium sulphate \nprecipitated from acidified samples in the field (see Section 3.2). Sulphate contents \ndetermined by gravimetry were similar to ICP-AES data, rather than IC data, suggesting that \nthe sulphate in the latter (unacidifed) samples had been subject to modification, either by \nbacterial reduction or mineral precipitation. Logistical constraints meant that time between \nsampling and analysis was over one month. Consequently, ICP-AES data for SO42\u2212 are used \nin preference to results obtained by IC.  \nCharge balance error (CBE) was calculated for major species (H+, Al3+, Fe2+, Ca2+, K+, Mg2+, \nMn2+, Na+, SO42\u2212, Cl\u2212, HCO3\u2212). Total carbonate is presented as HCO3\u2212 equivalent, and is \ncalculated as a monovalent anionic species for the purposes of charge balance. High CBE \nmay occur due to inappropriate choice of valency for carbonate species (i.e. if carbonate \nspecies are dominated by CO32\u2212, rather than HCO3\u2212). Charge balance error is higher for 2005 \nsamples as no carbonate analyses were made. For samples where all major species have been \nincluded, CBE should ideally be within \u00b15%.  \n3.2 Sulphur Isotopes \nFor aqueous sulphate analysis, 75 ml (100 ml for 2006 samples) of filtered sample was \ndecanted in the field into a HDPE bottle, acidified with 1 ml Tracepur\u00ae 69% HNO3, and an \nexcess of 5% BaCl2 solution was added slowly to precipitate BaSO4. In the laboratory, \nprecipitated BaSO4 was separated from the water by centrifuge, rinsed with deionised water, \ndried at 80\u00b0C overnight, and weighed to determine SO42\u2212 concentration. These data were \n10 \ncompared with the ICP-AES results as an approximate measure of recovery; recoveries were \n100% \u00b1 10% with the exception of SV212 (80%). \nNative sulphur crystals were picked by hand from altered rocks collected at fumarolic areas, \nwashed in deionised water in an ultrasonic bath for five minutes and dried in a desiccator \novernight. \nSulphur and sulphates were converted to SO2 for mass spectrometry at the Scottish \nUniversities Environmental Research Centre (SUERC) by conventional combustion \nprocedures (Coleman and Moore, 1978; Robinson and Kusakabe, 1975). The sulphur isotope \ncomposition of the purified SO2 was measured using a VG SIRA II gas mass spectrometer \nand standard corrections applied to raw \u03b466SO2 values to produce true \u03b434S relative to Vienna \nCa\u00f1on Diablo Troilite (V-CDT). Reproducibility and accuracy were monitored through \nreplicate measurements of international standards NBS 123 (17.7 \u00b1 0.3\u2030, n = 16), IAEA S3 \n(\u221231.6 \u00b1 0.3\u2030, n = 16), NBS 127 (21.2 \u00b1 0.8\u2030, n = 17) and SUERC\u2019s internal laboratory \nstandard CP-1 (\u22124.6 \u00b1 0.7\u2030, n = 24); mean values for standards are within error of the \naccepted values (Coplen et al., 2002; Lipfert et al., 2007). \n3.3 Oxygen and Hydrogen Isotopes \nIn the field, a filtered, unacidified fraction for isotopic analysis was decanted into a 14 ml \nglass McCartney bottle with a rubber-lined cap. Oxygen isotope ratios were analysed at \nSUERC using an automated CO2 equilibration technique (after Epstein and Mayeda, 1953) \nusing 1 ml of sample and analysing the resulting equilibrated CO2 on an Analytical Precision \nAP2003 continuous-flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer. Water was reduced to H2 using a \nchromium furnace (Donnelly et al., 2001); this was analysed using a VG SIRA 9 mass \nspectrometer (2005 samples) and a VG Optima (2006 samples). Oxygen and hydrogen \n11 \nisotopes were measured relative to V-SMOW. Reproducibility was within \u00b1 1.0\u2030 for \u03b418O \nand typically better than \u00b1 5\u2030 for \u03b4D for natural samples. \nThe \u03b418O of sulphate was measured at SUERC using the technique of Hall et al. (1991). \nBarium sulphate (recovered as in Section 3.2) was mixed with pure carbon in a platinum \ncrucible and heated in a vacuum line to produce CO2. Any CO produced was converted to C \nand CO2 in a Pt-electrode vessel. The resulting CO2 was analysed on a VG Isogas SIRA 10 \nmass spectrometer. Precision and accuracy were monitored by repeat analysis of international \nstandard NBS 127 (8.6 \u00b1 0.4\u2030, n = 10, accepted value 8.7\u2030; Kornexl et al. 1999).  \n3.4 Strontium Isotopes \nSr analysis was performed on unacidified water fractions at the NERC Isotope Geosciences \nLaboratories (NIGL). Sr was separated using standard techniques using Dowex AG50W-X8 \nion exchange resin (Royse et al., 1998). Samples were loaded onto single Re filaments using \na TaO activator, and analysed using a Thermo-Finnigan Triton mass spectrometer in static \nmulticollection mode. The Sr blank at the time of analysis was 111 pg. Replicate analyses of \nthe SRM987 standard solution gave an average value of 0.710263 \u00b1 4 (1\u03c3, n=50). Data are \nreported normalised to SRM987 = 0.710250.  \n4 Results \nHot spring discharges (T >80\u00b0C) are commonly classified according to dominant anion \ncomposition and pH, leading to four main categories: alkaline (or near neutral) chloride, acid \nsulphate, acid sulphate\u2013chloride (or \u201cvolcanic waters\u201d; Giggenbach, 1997), bicarbonate, and \nmixtures thereof (Ellis and Mahon, 1977). Hot springs from Savo are sulphate dominated, \nwith some bicarbonate\u2013sulphate springs (Fig. 2). However, the dominant alkaline sulphate \nsprings on Savo do not fit into the classical categories. There are two types of sulphate-rich \n12 \nhot springs at Savo, alkaline and acidic, which can be defined on the basis of chemistry, \nstable isotope ratios and physical nature of the spring. \n4.1 Alkaline Sulphate Hot Springs \nHot springs defined as alkaline sulphate type are pHC 7\u20138 and have a restricted \u03b434SSO4 of 5.4 \n\u00b1 1.5\u2030 (Table 1; Table 2; Fig. 3) and \u03b418OH2O values only slightly greater than local non-\nthermal groundwater. Sulphate \u03b418O values for alkaline hot springs vary between 4.0 and \n7.9\u2030.   \nCrater Wall springs (Table 1) are sulphate-rich (600\u2013680 mg\/l), with very low chloride \n(~5 mg\/l) and moderate DIC (~90 mg\/l HCO3\u2212 equivalent) and SiO2 (~250 mg\/l). Calcium is \nas high as ~250 mg\/l, Na ~90 mg\/l, K ~17 mg\/l, and Mg ~12 mg\/l. Only trace iron and \naluminium are present (<0.05 \u00b5g\/l). Important trace elements include Li (300 \u00b5g\/l), Rb \n(60 \u00b5g\/l), and Sr (3 mg\/l). In general, the analysed springs contain total dissolved solids \n(TDS) of <2000 mg\/l. \nThe Eastern Springs (Table 2) have similar sulphate contents to the Crater Wall springs (610\u2013\n650 mg\/l), but higher chloride (~40 mg\/l; still remarkably low), lower DIC (~40 mg\/l HCO3\u2212 \neqv.) and higher SiO2 (~375 mg\/l). Sodium and potassium concentrations are higher (~200 \nand 28 mg\/l respectively), and Ca and Mg lower (~100 and 5\u201310 mg\/l respectively) than the \nCrater Wall springs. Trace element concentrations are low overall, with increased alkali \nmetals (Rb ~120 \u03bcg\/l, Cs ~50 \u03bcg\/l) relative to the Crater Wall Springs. Arsenic contents are \nmeasurable at the Eastern Springs, with samples containing ~50 \u03bcg\/l. \nFig. 4 shows oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions of alkaline sulphate spring water. \nAlkaline sulphate hot springs are clustered at \u03b418O = \u22124 \u00b1 0.8\u2030 and \u03b4D = \u221236 \u00b1 3\u2030, with \ntwo outliers both showing enrichment of the heavier isotopes. SV208 shows considerable \n13 \nenrichment of both 18O and D, and also has the lowest \u03b434SSO4 value (+3.8\u2030) of the alkaline \nsulphate springs. \n4.2 Acid Sulphate Hot Springs \nSprings classified as acid sulphate type have a distinct \u03b434SSO4 of \u22120.6 \u00b1 2.5\u2030 (Fig. 3), \ncontrasting markedly with alkaline sulphate springs. They also display high \u03b418OH2O and \n\u03b4DH2O relative to non-thermal groundwater, and pHC <7 and often <4. A number of springs \nare connected to streams (particularly in the Reoka area) \u2013 these springs tend to have higher \npH than isolated variants, but are classified as acid sulphate due to their physical appearance \n(alteration of surrounding regolith to a base-depleted assemblage of kaolinite + silica \u00b1 \nanhydrite \u00b1 alunite, as determined by XRD), cation chemistry and stable isotope composition.  \nThe Crater Wall acid springs (Table 3) are low pH (<4) with high but variable sulphate (480\u2013\n820 mg\/l), SiO2 ~300 mg\/l, and low chloride (<6 mg\/l). Alkali metals are very similar \nbetween acid sulphate and alkaline sulphate springs in Crater Wall, whereas the alkaline \nearths tend to have slightly lower concentrations in the acid springs (Sr <2 mg\/l, Ca \n<200 mg\/l). Iron and aluminium concentrations are three orders of magnitude higher in the \nacid springs. Acid springs in Reoka show similar chemical trends. Concentrations of alkali \nmetals and alkali earths vary between locations. DIC correlates positively with pH, whereas \nAl and Fe show a negative correlation as anticipated.  \nThe stable isotope composition of water ranges from \u03b418O = \u22120.9\u2030 and \u03b4D = \u221227\u2030 to \u03b418O \n= +6.8\u2030 and \u03b4D = \u22123\u2030. The data form a linear array with slope 2.9 (scatter around line is \n\u00b15.4\u2030 \u03b4D for 1\u03c3). The two alkaline sulphate outliers also lie on this trend (Fig. 4). Sulphate \n\u03b418O ranges from 1.3 to 5.2\u2030. \n14 \n4.3 Bicarbonate\u2013Sulphate and Cold Springs \nA third class of hot spring on Savo has a more bicarbonate-rich chemistry (>200 mg\/l HCO3\u2212 \neqv.), with sulphate ~300 mg\/l (Table 4). The bicarbonate\u2013sulphate springs are lower \ntemperature than the acid and alkaline sulphate springs (~50\u00b0C), with pH 6\u20137. \u03b434SSO4 \naverages 5.4\u2030 which is identical to alkaline sulphate springs (Fig. 3), but isotopes of O and \nH are less enriched, and overlap with non-thermal ground water from Savo. Bicarbonate\u2013\nsulphate springs are often associated with travertine deposits. For bicarbonate\u2013sulphate \nspring SV422, major cations are dominated by Ca (200 mg\/l) and Mg (98 mg\/l), with lower \nNa (48 mg\/l) and K (6 mg\/l) than the alkaline sulphate springs. Only one analysis is presented \nhere, but based on field measurements of pH, temperature and observation of travertine \ndeposits, bicarbonate-sulphate springs occur across the island. \nCold springs (<30\u00b0C) were sampled from the Rembokola and Poghorovorughala catchments \n(near to the Eastern and Crater Wall thermal areas, respectively; Fig. 1), in both cases a short \ndistance downstream of the major thermal areas. Cold springs (Table 4) are high pH (7.5\u20138.0), \nwith low concentrations of most dissolved species. Calcium dominates the cation \ncomposition (40\u2013150 mg\/l), and sulphate is the major anion (100\u2013300 mg\/l). All species \noccur in lower concentrations in cold springs relative to hot springs from the same \ncatchments, with the exception of Mg (8\u201313 mg\/l). Cold spring samples cluster around \u03b418O \n= \u22128\u2030 and \u03b4D = \u221245\u2030. The cold springs lie just above the global meteoric water line, and \noverlap with compositions of waters collected from wells and the Tanginakulu bicarbonate\u2013\nsulphate spring (Fig. 4). \nData for the range of meteoric water isotope compositions in the Solomon Islands are \nunavailable, but comparison with data from Madang, Papua New Guinea (GNIP, 2006) \nsuggests that the values of Savo cold springs and wells (Table 5) are representative of an \n15 \naverage meteoric water composition for the south west Pacific (Madang varies from \u03b418O = \n\u221214 to \u22122\u2030 and \u03b4D = \u221292 to \u22123\u2030; average \u22127, \u221246\u2030). Thus, for the purposes of the \nfollowing discussion, the average isotopic composition of well and cold spring waters is \ninterpreted as being representative of meteoric-derived groundwater on Savo. \n4.4 Strontium Isotopes \n87Sr\/86Sr values (Fig. 5) for all hot and cold springs (average = 0.70420 \u00b1 9) overlap with the \nvalues for local rocks (average = 0.70414 \u00b1 11, based on 14 samples ranging from basalt to \ntrachyte; Smith et al., 2009). A seawater sample collected by the same method from offshore \nSavo has a 87Sr\/86Sr value of 0.709164 \u00b1 12 (the accepted value for modern seawater is \n0.709211 \u00b1 37; Elderfield 1986). Coastal wells analysed in this study have 87Sr\/86Sr values \nslightly higher (0.70442\u20130.70467) than those of the inland springs. \n4.5 Native Sulphur  \nNative sulphur collected from areas of steaming ground and fumarolic \/ solfataric activity \nshows negative \u03b434S values, ranging from \u22124.2 to \u22125.9\u2030, lower than sulphate recovered from \nacid springs, and considerably lower than that of alkaline springs (Table 5; Fig. 3). \n5 Discussion \n5.1 Water Chemistry \nSurface discharge from the hydrothermal system at Savo is dominated by alkaline sulphate-\ntype springs. The features of these springs (high sulphate, high silica, moderate Na-K-Ca-Mg, \nhigh pH, low chloride) are unusual in that sulphate-rich, chloride-poor springs are typically \nacidic, steam-heated springs. This is not the case at Savo. \nNear-neutral or alkaline fluids from hydrothermal areas are typically close to equilibrium \nwith a secondary (hydrothermally altered) mineral assemblage (Giggenbach, 1988). Although \n16 \nSavo\u2019s alkaline sulphate springs have neutral to alkaline pH and high silica (indicating a \nsignificant amount of water\u2013rock reaction has taken place), they are not in water\u2013rock \nequilibrium (Fig. 6; Giggenbach, 1988). Instead, the alkaline sulphate springs form a chord \nwithin the immature waters field, trending from the \u221aMg apex towards 260\u2013300\u00b0C \nequilibrium. The alkaline sulphate springs plot close to the isochemical host rock dissolution \nfield, but their high pH, and low Fe and Al contents rule out isochemical dissolution as the \nprocess governing their Na-K-Mg composition. Such a process is largely limited to highly \nacidic fluids (Giggenbach, 1988). \nOn Fig. 6, the ratio Na\/K is controlled by exchange of alkalis between aqueous fluids and \ncoexisting feldspars, and is the basis of a widely used chemical thermometer (Fournier, 1979; \nTruesdell, 1984). The K\/Mg ratio is controlled by equilibration with chlorite and other Mg-\ncontaining clays, and with biotite at high temperatures (Ellis and Mahon, 1977). The Na\/K \nratio of a hydrothermal fluid is slower to re-equilibrate down-temperature than K\/Mg, and as \na result is less subject to progressive resetting upon ascent and discharge. The simplest \nexplanation for the array of points produced by alkaline sulphate springs on Fig. 6 (with \nrelatively homogeneous Na\/K, but variable Mg) is that the alkaline sulphate waters have \nequilibrated at 260\u2013300\u00b0C and been subject to variable addition of more Mg-rich (cooler) \nwaters. \nFurther evidence for fluid mixing and particular dilution of the alkaline sulphate waters \ncomes from a comparison of various chemical thermometers. Na\/K temperatures are much \nhigher (260\u2013300\u00b0C) than those derived from quartz solubility (Truesdell, 1984), and sulphate \noxygen isotope (McKenzie and Truesdell, 1977) thermometers (Fig. 7). The two latter \nthermometers are affected by dilution, with a slight reduction in silica contents expected as \ncold waters are added, and a shift to lower \u03b418H2O affecting the sulphate oxygen calculation. \n17 \nThe thermometer discrepancies indicate that the alkaline sulphate fluids have been subject to \nsignificant mixing and dilution by a more Mg-rich, and therefore presumably cooler water, \nwith lower \u03b418O, such as that discharged from cold springs (SV520, Table 4).  \nFurther evidence of mixing is displayed on Fig. 8. The Eastern and Crater Wall alkaline \nsulphate springs define complex mixing lines, with the former towards a hydrothermal end-\nmember, and the latter closer in composition to bicarbonate\u2013sulphate and cold springs. \nConservative elements such as Cl, Li, and Na (also B, K, Cs, Rb, and As; not shown on plots) \nshow simple, straight-line dilution trends from Eastern to Crater Wall. These elements are \npresent in higher concentrations in hydrothermal fluids because they are leached from the \nhost rocks. Conversely, Mg is higher in low temperature fluids, as the formation of minerals \nsuch as chlorite rapidly removes it from high temperature fluids (Giggenbach, 1988). As a \nresult, mixing leads to an increase from Eastern to Crater Wall. Bicarbonate also increases, \nmost likely as a result of the higher solubility of CO2 in cooler waters.  \nSulphate has a complicated relationship with fluid mixing. Simple analysis of spring \ncompositions with SOLVEQ (Reed, 1982; Reed and Spycher, 1984; ignoring boiling and \nvolatile loss) indicates that the Eastern springs are saturated with anhydrite at approximately \n120\u00b0C, whereas the Crater Wall springs are saturated at the discharge temperature of 100\u00b0C, \nand both are significantly lower than the 260\u2013300\u00b0C Na\/K temperature. This indicates that \neither sulphate, or more likely Ca (Fig. 8) has been added to the fluids post- Na\/K equilibrium \n\u2013 anhydrite should become progressively undersaturated as the waters cool. The low \nsaturation temperatures suggest the presence of anhydrite in the subsurface. Addition of \ncooler water encourages anhydrite dissolution and therefore maintains high sulphate \nconcentrations in the springs. This process is discussed more fully in the following section. \n18 \nNear surface boiling also affects the hot spring composition, most notably pH. Again using \nSOLVEQ (Reed, 1982; Reed and Spycher, 1984) to determine mineral saturations, calcite \nwas supersaturated at discharge temperature (Log Q\/K\u22481.3 for Crater Wall, 0.2\u20130.6 for \nEastern springs). Such supersaturation cannot be maintained at or above these temperatures \n(Palandri and Reed, 2001), suggesting that there has been CO2 loss and an according rise in \npH due to boiling. This process is at least partly responsible for the high pH of the spring \nwaters. Springs are often surrounded by an apron of travertine and sinter as a result of the \nsupersaturation of calcite (due to boiling and pH increase) and amorphous silica (due to \ncooling upon discharge). \nSteaming ground and acid sulphate springs are further evidence of subsurface boiling at Savo. \nThe acid springs at Savo are typical of steam-heated springs reported from other locations, in \nboth physical appearance, setting, chemistry and stable isotope composition. Both acid and \nalkaline springs occur in close proximity, presumably physically separated by a boiling\/ \nsteam-heated zone, with the acid springs perched above this zone at the surface.  \nThe final class of thermal spring that occurs at Savo is bicarbonate\u2013sulphate type. Similar \nsprings are relatively common in geothermal areas, occurring in parts of the system where \nCO2 condenses into cold groundwater (Ellis and Mahon, 1977), either at depth or at the \nperiphery of steam-heated areas. At Savo, sulphate is derived from small amounts of mixing \nwith other sulphate-rich fluids, principally the alkaline sulphate type fluid (given the similar \nisotopic composition of the different spring types; Fig. 3). The elevated Ca and Mg \nconcentrations indicate that the bicarbonate\u2013sulphate water discharged at these springs has \nundergone moderate to low temperature (<100\u00b0C) reaction with the host rocks. \nThe sulphate content of these springs indicates that mixing with hydrothermal fluids occurs. \nThis is unsurprising, given the Mg contents of the alkaline sulphate springs indicates the \n19 \nsame process. Evidence of mixing in both the high and low temperature fluids points towards \nthe system at Savo being relatively \u201copen\u201d\u2013 that is, multiple fluid end-members are \nrepresented, but they mix freely, and as such, a spectrum of fluids are discharged. \n5.1.1 Geochemical Modelling \nAs dilution, in terms of the elemental fluid chemistry, is a good candidate process for \ngenerating high sulphate, high silica, low chloride fluids at Savo, itwas investigated further \nby modelling the geochemical reactions of a simplified hydrothermal system with CHILLER \n(Reed, 1982; Reed, 1998). For this, two end member fluids were used (Table 6)\u2013 the \nchloride-rich fluid (based on a condensate from Augustine volcano mixed 1:10 with pure \nwater; Reed, 1997; Symonds et al., 1990) and a synthetic chloride-poor, sulphate rich fluid \n(Reed, 1997). The simulation took these fluids and in separate runs, reacted them with an \nunaltered sodic trachyte (SV17; Smith et al., 2009) at 300\u00b0C to produce two rock-equilibrated \nfluids \u2013 one chloride rich, the other chloride poor. These were then used in a simulation of \ndilution. In this case, 300\u00b0C pure water was added to the fluid and its associated secondary \nmineral assemblage (Table 6).  \nComparison of the high and low chloride models indicates a number of common \ncharacteristics (Table 6, Fig. 9). As dilution increases: there is a small pH increase (Table 6); \na significant decrease in the concentrations of Cl\u2212 and HCO3\u2212; and dissolved SiO2 remains \nrelatively unchanged. Dissolved SO42\u2212 and HS\u2212 increase until the controlling mineral phases \n(anhydrite and pyrite respectively) have been consumed. Aqueous silica remains relatively \nconstant due to the abundance of quartz in the secondary mineral assemblage. The extended \nrun for the high chloride system (Fig. 9) in particular displays this phenomenon, with a \nmarked inflection in the trend of SO42\u2212 concentration when anhydrite is exhausted; once the \ncontrolling mineral is gone, the dissolved components are diluted at a 1:1 ratio (as for Cl\u2212). \n20 \nThough isothermal dilution is a simplification of the actual process, these simulations \ndemonstrate that simple dilution, when \u201cbuffered\u201d by a mineral assemblage, is a plausible \nexplanation for reducing the chloride content of a hydrothermal fluid whilst maintaining or \neven enhancing concentrations of sulphate and silica. \nThe chemistry of the alkaline sulphate springs suggests considerable fluid mixing and \ndilution, probably with a cooler water on the basis of the high Mg2+ concentrations. The \nabundance of cooler waters to dilute the hydrothermal system is most likely a result of the \ntropical climate of the Solomon Islands and high annual rainfall (3\u20135 m; Solomon Islands \nMeteorological Service). \n5.2 Oxygen and Hydrogen Isotopes of Water \nThe alkaline sulphate springs discharge rapidly, and the residence time of any mass of water \nin the spring is short. Thus, the isotopic composition of the fluids is unlikely to be affected by \npost-discharge evaporation. Two exceptions to this are the outliers shown on Fig. 4 (SV207 \nand 208), that appear to have undergone evaporative enrichment similar to the acid springs \n(see below). \nThe position of the alkaline sulphate springs on Fig. 4 can be produced by a number of \ndifferent (although not mutually exclusive) processes. On \u03b418O\u2013\u03b4D plots, the condensation of \nmagmatic vapour into meteoric-derived groundwater produces a straight mixing line between \nthe two end-member compositions (Hedenquist and Aoki, 1991). However, the chemistry of \nthe springs (high pH, low chloride) is inconsistent with such an origin, thus meteoric\u2013\nmagmatic mixing is unlikely to be the sole process determining the isotopic composition of \nthe alkaline sulphate springs. Water\u2013rock reaction produces horizontal shifts in \u03b418O\u2013\u03b4D \nspace, whilst boiling causes minor increase of \u03b4D (Fig. 4; Giggenbach and Stewart, 1982). \nThe latter two processes can be demonstrated to occur at Savo (sections 5.1 and 5.1.1), whilst \n21 \nthe addition of magmatic volatiles is likely based on the high temperatures (300\u00b0C Na\/K \ntemperature) and sulphur contents of the fluids. That the \u03b418O and \u03b4D values of the springs \nare relatively close to the meteoric composition, despite high temperature water\u2013rock reaction \nand presumed addition of magmatic volatiles is further evidence that the system at Savo is \nsubject to dilution and flushing with fresh water. \nThe acid sulphate springs analysed at Savo (plus two of the outliers from the alkaline \nsulphate cluster) lie on a trend with a slope close to 3 with an origin at local meteoric, \nsuggesting evaporation is the dominant control on the oxygen and hydrogen isotopic \ncomposition on these springs (Fig. 4; Craig 1963). \n5.3 Sulphur Isotopes and Sources of Sulphate \nIn magmatic-hydrothermal systems sulphate-rich fluids are generally produced by two \nprocesses: condensation of primary magmatic volatiles, including SO2, into groundwater; or \noxidation of H2S from a secondary steam phase in surface waters: \n 4SO2 + 4H2O = 3H2SO4 + H2S 1 \n H2S + 2O2 = H2SO4 2 \nThe first reaction involves the disproportionation of magmatic SO2 upon reaction with water \nat temperatures below about 350\u00b0C (Holland, 1965). Isotopic fractionation results in H2SO4 \nbeing enriched in 34S, and the H2S depleted in 34S (Ohmoto and Rye, 1979). This H2S may \neventually be oxidised at the surface as in equation 2 to produce native sulphur or sulphate \ndepleted in 34S relative to the bulk sulphur value for the magma (Rye, 1993). \nThe isotopic composition of native sulphur from fumaroles, as well as sulphate from acid \nsprings, should be representative of the H2S within the system. The oxidation of H2S  at the \nsurface (equation 2) approximately preserves the sulphur isotope signature of the H2S (Rye et \nal., 1992). Mixing with high-\u03b434S fluids (such as alkaline sulphate-fed streams) increases the \n22 \nvalues in the acid sulphate springs and accounts for the spread of data away from the negative \nnative sulphur values. \nComparison of the H2S proxies and alkaline sulphate \u03b434S shows that they are far from \nisotopic equilibrium (calculated equilibrium temperature is >600\u00b0C; Ohmoto and Rye, 1979). \nTwo processes can account for this. One is that sulphur isotope equilibrium is only slowly \nattained at high pH (Ohmoto and Lasaga, 1982), and so if high pH fluids dominate the \nsubsurface of Savo (as they do the surface) then sulphur isotope equilibrium is unlikely to \noccur. A second explanation is that pyrite and other sulphides are re-dissolved by relatively \noxidising waters \u201cflushing\u201d the system, which moves the sulphate composition towards lower \nvalues. \nSeawater contamination can be ruled out as a source of 34S-enriched sulphate to the alkaline \nsprings \u2013 chloride and 87Sr\/86Sr values are inconsistent with any significant (>1%) marine \ncontributions (Fig. 5).  \nImportantly, the sulphur isotope date show that the alkaline springs are unlikely to represent \nevolved steam-heated waters that have attained isotopic equilibration between sulphate and \nsulphide\/H2S, given the time required for equilibration is approximately 10,000 years, at pH 7 \nand temperatures <150\u00b0C (Rye et al., 1992).  \n5.4 Comparison with Other Springs \nAlthough sulphate-rich, chloride-poor fluids are found at many springs worldwide, typically \nthey are steam-heated acid sulphate springs. Higher pH sulphate-rich springs are rarely \nrecorded in the literature. Table 7 contains water chemistry data for a number of moderate to \nhigh pH sulphate springs. However, unlike Savo, the waters recorded in Table 7 are not the \ndominant water type discharging from their respective hydrothermal systems \u2013 acid sulphate \nand\/or chloride-rich waters dominate in all four examples.  \n23 \nThe Black Pool in the crater of El Chich\u00f3n, Mexico, is a muddy, closed pool, with a \ntemperature and chemical composition similar to the alkaline sulphate springs of Savo, but \nwith a slightly acidic pH. Taran et al. (1998) observe that the spring is dilute, but compare its \nchemistry to steam-heated acid-sulphate springs within the volcanic crater, implying a steam-\nheated origin. Sulphur isotopes can be used to distinguish the steam-heated and alkaline \nsulphate springs at Savo, and dilution of an acid sulphate spring cannot account for the high \nSiO2 and consistent (high) Na\/K temperatures of the alkaline springs. \nStimac et al. (2004) suggest a steam and gas condensation origin for the (pre-1991 eruption) \nUpper Maranout springs of Pinatubo, as do Giggenbach et al. (1990) for Las Nereidas springs \nof Nevado del Ruiz (Colombia). These springs, with elevated bicarbonate concentrations, are \nmore similar in chemistry to the cooler bicarbonate-sulphate springs of Savo. At Pinatubo, \nRuiz and Savo, the bicarbonate-enriched springs are peripheral to the high temperature fluids, \nand have relatively low temperatures. At Savo, sulphate would appear to be derived from \nmixing with alkaline sulphate fluids rather than from oxidation of H2S, based on their stable \nisotope compositions (\u201cOther springs\u201d; Fig. 3) as compared to the native sulphur, acid and \nalkaline springs.  \nThj\u00f3rs\u00e1rdalur spring (Table 7), is from an area of high gas flux on Iceland. Arn\u00f3rsson et al. \n(1983) suggested its high-sulphate chemistry is formed by the dissolution and oxidation of \nsecondary pyrite. This process is not dissimilar to the process as envisaged at Savo, with the \ndissolution of secondary hydrothermal alteration assemblages buffering the fluid composition \nduring dilution. Sulphur isotopes from the alkaline sulphate springs suggest that anhydrite \nand sulphate derived from SO2 disproportionation contributes to the springs at Savo, rather \nthan exclusively the oxidation of pyrite \u2013 which would result in similar isotopic compositions \nbetween native sulphur, acid sulphate and alkaline springs. \n24 \nIn summary, dilution plays an important role in the springs listed in Table 7, driving the pH \nto higher values whilst maintaining low chloride concentrations. However, most of the fluids \nin Table 7 formed in relatively shallow, peripheral areas, mostly by steam-heated processes. \nThe alkaline sulphate springs at Savo are from a hotter, deeper system (i.e. they are hypogene \nfluids), as indicated by the sulphur isotopes, Na\/K characteristics, high temperatures, and \nhigh SiO2 concentrations.   \n6 Conclusions \nThe hydrothermal system of Savo volcano is manifested at the surface by a number of hot \nspring types. The dominant spring type is of an unusual alkaline sulphate-type composition, \ncharacterised by dilute, high pH (7\u20138), low chloride (<50 mg\/l), high sulphate (>600 mg\/l) \nand high silica (>250 mg\/l) waters. They have \u03b434SSO4 values clustered around 5.4 (\u00b1 1.5\u2030) \nand \u03b418OH2O values slightly more enriched than non-thermal groundwater (\u22124\u2030 and \u22128\u2030, \nrespectively). The springs have relatively consistent Na\/K thermometer temperatures of 260\u2013\n300\u00b0C, indicating a hot, deep, hypogene origin. A smaller number of acid sulphate springs \nalso occur, with distinct \u03b434SSO4 values (\u22120.6 \u00b1 2.5\u2030) compared to the alkaline sulphate \nfluids, higher \u03b418OH2O and \u03b4DH2O values, and variable, but generally low pH (2\u20137), typical of \nsteam-heated springs. \nThe unusual alkaline sulphate springs discharging at Savo volcano record a range of \nhydrothermal processes, including water\u2013rock reaction, fluid mixing and the addition of \nmagmatic volatiles. Initially sulphate-rich fluids, with an unknown chloride concentration, \nreact and equilibrate with the host rock. Secondary minerals in this assemblage provide \nimportant buffers for the fluid composition (sulphate and silica in particular) as large amounts \nof cooler, fresh water are added to the system, most likely as a result of the tropical, high \nrainfall climate of Savo and the Solomon Islands. \n25 \nDilution is the key process whereby the alkaline sulphate fluids derive their high pH and \nhigh-sulphate, low-chloride chemistry. Mixing with dilute, meteoric-dominated, Ca\u2013Mg-rich \nfluids results in spring discharges that only partially record reservoir conditions; at discharge \nthe chemistry has been greatly modified from that which was presumably in equilibrium with \na hydrothermal mineral assemblage at depth.  \nLow chloride in particular provides evidence for heavily diluted hydrothermal fluids. \nSulphate is the major anion but responds differently to fluid mixing and dilution compared to \nchloride because it is to a certain extent controlled by precipitation and re-dissolution of \nsulphate and sulphide minerals in the subsurface.  \nNear-surface boiling contributes a final, small pH increase as volatile species (CO2 and \npossibly H2S) are degassed. Fluids are saturated with various minerals at the surface, notably \ncalcite and amorphous silica, leading to the precipitation of travertine and sinter deposits. \nA wide range of groundwater compositions is exhibited at Savo (alkaline sulphate, acid \nsulphate, bicarbonate\u2013sulphate and cold springs), but evidence for mixing between these \ntypes, both at the surface and in the subsurface, is strong. As such, Savo represents a \nrelatively open system. \nCommon hydrothermal processes have combined at Savo to produce unusual fluid chemistry. \nHigh rainfall increases the effectiveness and likelihood of fluid mixing. Savo displays \ngeological features similar to meteoric-dominated geothermal systems, including extensive \nsinter deposits and widespread steam-heated zones, but fluids discharge from the majority of \nthe springs have an unusual chemistry. The recognition of features such as sinters and \ncarbonate veins in an ancient hydrothermal setting is not necessarily diagnostic of neutral \nchloride fluids in a geothermal system environment \u2013 they may be produced in a Savo-like, \nlow chloride, diluted magmatic-hydrothermal system.  \n26 \n7 Acknowledgements \nThis research was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (UK) and British \nGeological Survey University Funding Initiative as part of PhD studentship \nNER\/S\/A\/2004\/12339.
