One of the key foundational\npropositions of this logic is the customer as \u201calways being a co-creator of value\u201d where \u201cthe brand\nbecomes the experience\u201d (Prahalad, 2004). In this paper, the authors examine the concept of brand\nrelationship experience in the context of co-creation and service-dominant logic and outline a conceptual\nmodel for designing and managing the customer experience. Case study research illustrates how this\nmodel helps in the design and management of the brand relationship experience for an innovative new\nproduct.\nKeywords: co-creation, brand, experience, service-dominant logic; brand relationship experience\n1Co-Creating Brands: Diagnosing and Designing the Relationship Experience\nIntroduction\nFor a decade or more, researchers have called for a paradigm shift in marketing. (e.g., Gr\u00f6nroos,\n1997; Gummesson, 1997; Sheth, 1996). Academics around the world are realizing that marketing, which\ninitially adopted the customer\u2019s perspective, ironically, has lost this focus (Ambler, 2004). Now an\nincreasing amount of research is emerging, re-focusing attention on the customer perspective. In\nparticular, Vargo and Lusch\u2019s (2004) recent award-winning paper develops a provocative and exciting\nbasis for a new service-dominant logic in marketing which emphasizes this customer perspective. As\nBallantyne and Varey (2006) note, Vargo and Lusch bring together a number of previously disparate\nmarketing concepts and ideas in a way that represents a fundamental challenge to the presumptions of\nmainstream marketing theory and practice.\nInherent in the service-dominant logic perspective is a view that service is the common denominator\nin exchange, not some special form of exchange - i.e., what goods are not (Vargo and Lusch, 2004). In\naddition, a service-dominant logic of exchange is likely to be more integrative than a goods-dominant\nlogic (Vargo and Morgan, 2005). Central to this perspective is their foundational proposition relating to\nco-creation that involves customer\u2019s active involvement and interaction with their supplier in every\naspect, from product design to product consumption. However, amidst this increasing amount of\nresearch on service-dominant logic, remarkably little attention focuses on the brand. One exception is\nPrahalad\u2019s (2004) commentary on Vargo and Lusch\u2019s work when he proposes an experience-centered,\nco-creation perspective where the brand becomes the experience.\nThe aim of this paper is to develop a conceptual model for understanding co-creation of a brand\nthrough relationship experience design in business-to-consumer markets utilizing managerial insights\n2and existing marketing theory. The authors structure the article as follows: first, they review the nature\nof service-dominant logic and co-creation. Second, they discuss the literature relating to co-creation,\nbrands, brand relationships and the customer experience. Third, they explain the process of developing\nthe conceptual model for co-creation. This process utilizes \u201cinteractive research\u201d (Gummesson, 2002)\nand consists of three phases - pre-understanding, analysis and model development. Fourth, they explain\nthe model and its key components. Fifth, they use case study research to illustrate the application of the\nmodel in a company-specific context. Finally, they discuss the contribution of the article together with\nmanagerial implications and future research opportunities.\nService-Dominant Logic and Co-Creation\nFrom the 1980s, newer perspectives such as relationship marketing, quality management, market\norientation, services marketing and brand relationships have challenged the dominant logic of marketing\n(Smit, Bronner and Tolboom, 2007). These newer frames of reference have also identified limitations in\nthe traditional goods-dominant logic. A common theme in this body of work is that the dominant logic\nof marketing is shifting from the exchange of tangible goods to the exchange of intangibles such as\nskills, knowledge and processes.\nFrom a goods-dominant logic perspective, suppliers produce products and customers buy them. With\na service-dominant logic, customers engage in dialogue and interaction with their suppliers during\nproduct design, production, delivery and consumption. Researchers now often use the term co-creation\n(or co-production) to describe this customer-supplier dialogue and interaction. Service-dominant logic\nsuggests that value starts with the supplier understanding customer value-creating processes and learning\nhow to support customers\u2019 co-creation activities. Thus, the customer as \u201calways being a co-creator of\nvalue\u201d is a key foundational proposition of this logic (Vargo and Lusch, 2004).\n3These developments provide an opportunity to look at branding and brands through the lens of co-\ncreation and customer experiences. Given Prahalad\u2019s (2004) co-creation viewpoint where the brand\nbecomes the experience, de Chernatony\u2019s (2006) contemporary experiential definition of a brand is\nespecially relevant: \u201cA brand can be regarded as a cluster of functional and emotional values, which\npromises a unique and welcome experience [emphasis added]\u201d. This article explores the nature of the\nbrand as a relationship experience (the brand relationship experience). The authors use this term to\nrepresent a relationship-based view of the brand seen from the perspective of ongoing customer\nexperiences - a perspective consistent with co-creation and service-dominant logic.\nCo-Creation and Brands\nResearchers such as Gr\u00f6nroos (2000), Prahalad and Ramaswamy (2000) and Vargo and Lusch\n(2004) argue that value is embedded in the co-creation process between the customer and the supplier,\nand where the customer shifts from being a passive audience to an active player. Prahalad (2004)\nproposes that value creation is embedded in personalized experiences: \u201c\u2026 early experimenters are\nmoving away from the old industry model that sees value as created from products and services to a new\nmodel where value is created by experiences\u201d. This research concurs with earlier work on experiential\nmarketing (e.g., Holbrook and Hirschmann, 1982) which emphasizes emotions, contexts and symbolic\naspects of experiences. Later work suggests that creating value is not so much about conventional\nadvertising and branding, but focuses on building processes to support the customer experience (e.g.,\nPine and Gilmore, 1999).\nDespite the substantial quantity of research on branding issues, this topic remains a fragmented and\ncontextual concept (Jevons, 2007). Further, researchers in the brand management domain place\nsurprisingly little emphasis on brand relationships, customer experience and co-creation. In the context\n4of service-dominant logic, Arnould, Price and Malshe (2006) observe that branding and brand equity\n\u201cseem ripe for revision\u201d. Leading researchers Keller and Lehmann (2006) recently reviewed research\nand future priorities in branding. They highlighted brand relationships and customer experience as two\nkey areas requiring further development.\nSome research is now starting to emphasize the building of brands and relationships around\ncustomers rather than company requirements (e.g., Dall\u2019Olmo Riley and de Chernatony, 2000), and such\nwork is moving brand researchers in the direction of a co-creation approach to the brand (e.g., Bello, de\nChernatony and Shiu, 2007). However, in the area of service-dominant logic and co-creation, little work\ndeals with brands and brand experiences. As Brodie, Glynn and Little (2006) observe, any reference to\nbranding in the service literature is often indirect and that Vargo and Lusch (2004) only briefly mention\nthe branding concept. Building on this introduction, the authors now review the relevant literature in the\nareas of brand relationships and customer experience.\nBrand Relationships, Customer Communities and Customer Experience\nSmit et al. (2007) argue that the brand relationship concept is an important research topic because of\nthe potential advantages such as reduced marketing costs, ease of access to customers, improved\nacquisition of new customers, and improved customer retention and profitability. Despite this\nobservation, the topic remains under-researched. Fournier (1998), in her review of relationship theory in\nthe brand domain, points to a deficiency of relationship-based studies in consumer markets and\nespecially those concerned with consumer products.\nMore recently, researchers have used the relationship perspective as the main theoretical lens for\nunderstanding consumer brand interactions (e.g., Swaminathan, Page and Gurhan-Canli, 2007). Several\nresearchers also support the concept of customers having relationships with their brands (e.g., Fournier,\n51998; Muniz and O\u2019Guinn, 2001; Rozanski, Baum and Wolfsen, 1999; Smit, Bronner and Tolboom,\n2007). However, as Dowling (2002) and O\u2019Malley and Tynan (2001) point out, the importance of the\nbrand to the consumer does vary as some brands inherently may be better suited for building a\nrelationship than others.\nIn this article, the authors adopt Aggarwal\u2019s (2004) view that consumers form relationships with\nbrands that mirror their social relationships. He defines relationships as \u201ca sequence of interactions\nbetween parties where the probable course of future interactions between them is significantly different\nfrom that of strangers\u201d - thus \u201cconsumer interactions with brands can be characterized as relational\u201d.\nAggarwal concludes that even though people\u2019s relationships with brands do not necessarily share the\nsame richness and depth as their relationships with human partners, they can interact with brands as if\nthey have a relationship with them.\nWithin the consumer research literature, there is evidence of an increasing focus on co-creation and\ntopics related to this subject. Of particular interest is the nature of customer-to-customer interactions and\nthe role of the customer as a co-creator. This work is discussed more generally within the research on\nconsumer tribes or brand tribes, brand communities and user communities. Other specific terms used to\ndescribe these customer to customer interactions include: \u201cCitizen Marketers\u201d (McConnell and Huba,\n2007) and \u201cWikinomics\u201d (Tapscott and Williams, 2006).\nResearch interest in the concept of consumer tribes (e.g., Bennett, 1999; Cova, 1997; Cova and Cova,\n2002; Cova, Kozinets and Shankar, 2007, Kozinets, 1999; Patterson, 1998), and brand communities\n(e.g., McAlexander, Schouten, and Koenig, 2002; Muniz and O\u2019Guinn, 2001) has increased significantly\nin recent years. Brand identity is co-created with consumers and other stakeholders and this element of\nco-creation is especially apparent in consumer groups such as brand communities. Typically, these\ngroups become active carriers of brand meaning, rather than followers of the company\u2019s idea of the\n6constituion of their brand (e.g., Csaba and Bengtsson, 2006; McAlexander et al., 2002; Muniz and\nO\u2019Guinn, 2001).\nA further related area of research focuses on user communities, user innovation and user design.\nResearchers describe user communities as sub-cultures of consumption which involve consumers as\ninnovators in the active creation of markets, alongside company development of new products\n(Goulding and Saren, 2007). This work includes literature on lead users in the business-to-business\nsector (e.g., Urban and Von Hippel, 1988; Von Hippel, 1986) and on-line product innovation by user\ngroups (e.g., F\u00fcller, Jawecki and M\u00fchlbhacher, 2007).\nSeveral key points emerge from consideration of the research reviewed in this section. First, the\nrelationship perspective is receiving more attention, including the notion of customers having some form\nof relationship with their brands. Second, attention is shifting from brand producers to an understanding\nof how consumers\u2019 responses create brand meaning and how branding works (e.g., Schroeder and\nSalzer-M\u00f6rling, 2006). Third, researchers are now recognizing the importance of customer-to-customer\ninteractions and the role brand communities can play in co-creation. Fourth, researchers are\nacknowledging that the customer can have an important place in co-creating innovative ideas for product\ndevelopment and becoming more closely involved with the brand. When the customer becomes a co-\ndesigner of a product, potential exists to enhance their emotional connection with a brand (e.g.,\nDemirbilek and Sener, 2003). Finally, Holbrook (2006a; 2006b; 2007a; 2007b), in assessing ten recent\nmanagerial contributions in the area of experience management, concludes that much of this work has a\ngeneral lack of conceptual foundation and empirical direction.\nWhilst the research outlined above adds considerable insight into a number of specific aspects of\nmarketing relationships, customer experience and brands, the authors conclude that researchers have\ngiven little attention to developing conceptual frameworks and methodologies that focus on managing\n7and designing customer\u2019s brand experiences from a managerial perspective. Fournier (1998) supports\nthis view and concludes that no studies \u201c\u2026have yet offered a comprehensive relationship-oriented view\nof consumer-brand interactions \u2013 one that starts with basic relationship principles and builds an\nintegrative framework to explain and explore the form and dynamics of those interactions\u201d. These\nconsiderations led the authors to develop the following research question: How can a conceptual model,\nthat integrates the concepts of co-creation and branding, be developed for diagnosing and designing\ncustomer relationship experiences? This research question provides the motivation for the current\nresearch.\nThe Model Development Process\nThe research reported here is part of an investigation into co-creation involving the development of a\nconceptual model for co-creation purposes that the authors extend to encompass contemporary thinking\non branding. Figure 1 shows an overview of the model development process. The research utilized\n\u201cinteractive research\u201d (Gummesson, 2002), where \u201cinteractions with groups of managers play a crucial\nrole in research generation and concept testing\u201d. The process consisted of the following three phases -\npre-understanding, analysis and model development. Each phase included a full-day research workshop\nwith senior level executive vice-presidents and their direct reports, drawn from eighteen organizations.\nWhilst Vargo and Lusch (2008) note that service-dominant logic has the potential to unify and simplify\napparently disparate thoughts between consumer and industrial marketing, the primary focus of this\ncurrent research interest is on business-to-consumer relationships. Sixteen of the eighteen companies\nwere involved in business-to-consumer relationships. Two companies had business-to-business\nrelationships. These were included in the sample as the researchers were interested in learning whether\n8data from the business-to-business sector might provide further insight in understanding value co-\ncreation within the business-to-consumer sector.\nFIGURE 1 HERE\nNine of these organizations are substantial international companies; the remaining nine are major\ncompanies operating on a regional basis or are nationally based firms. The organizations involved in this\nstudy are service providers (travel, hospitality, energy, retail, software), financial services providers\n(financing and insurance), fulfillment organizations (logistics companies), media companies (newspaper\nand television) internet and mobile service access (telecommunication operators), and mobile device and\nnetwork providers (mobile phone companies). The organizations participated in the research process as\nthey have a keen interest in exploring new ways to co-create value and build meaningful experiences for\ntheir customers.\nDuring the pre-understanding phase, shown in Figure 1, the authors developed an initial framework\nfor managing the co-creation of value based on the literature on value, value chains, co-creation, service-\ndominant logic, relationship marketing, consumer behavior and branding. To refine this initial\nframework, which reflects the centrality of processes in co-creation (e.g. Vargo and Lusch, 2004;\nWebster, 2002), the authors discussed the framework during interviews with two senior level executives\nfrom each of the eighteen companies. Following this initial work, they then held the first interaction\nresearch workshop. This workshop was directed at identifying co-creation insights within customer-\nsupplier relationships. After a detailed briefing of the executives, the authors divided the managers into\ngroups of between four and six people and asked them to describe the key components of value co-\ncreation within customer-supplier relationships. During the workshop, the researchers recorded these\ncomponents on white boards, and the managers then progressively refined their initial\nconceptualizations.\n9During the analysis phase, the authors analyzed the output of the first workshop with reference to a\nfurther literature review, data from the interviews and other data collected from the companies during\nthe first phase of the research. Based on this analysis, they developed a preliminary version of the\nconceptual model, which was refined further during the second interactive research workshop. This\nworkshop adopted a similar process as the first one and focused on evaluating and critiquing the\nemerging framework and its components.\nDuring the model development phase, the authors undertook a synthesis of the output from the\nsecond workshop where participating companies identified key themes and best practices. The authors\nextended their literature review as they developed the model and identified further components. In the\nthird interaction research workshop, the authors presented this revised model and asked participants to\nconsider this model in the context of their own companies. Many of the organizations had utilized some\nof the model components in the time between the second and third workshops and applied them in their\nown company\u2019s development work. This final workshop provided a further opportunity to refine the\nmodel. In the next section, the authors discuss the model for co-creating the brand relationship\nexperience and the key processes involved.\nThe Model: Key Components and Processes\nThe importance of processes is widely acknowledged in both the literature on marketing strategy and\ncustomer management (e.g., Srivastava, Shervani and Fahey, 1999; Webster, 2002) and on service-\ndominant logic and co-creation (e.g., Prahalad and Ramaswamy, 2004; Vargo and Lusch, 2004;). In\nparticular, Vargo and Lusch (2004) suggest that researchers can regard marketing as a set of processes\nand resources with which the company seeks to create value propositions. These processes include\nprocedures, tasks, activities, mechanisms, and interactions that collectively support the co-creation of\n10\nvalue. This focus on processes is a key feature of the model. The academic literature, earlier research\nand later field-based work confirmed the need for a practical process-based co-creation model.\nThe model outlined in Figure 2 extends an earlier, more general co-creation framework to consider\nbrand and experience-related issues together with recent work on brand synthesis and brand knowledge\n(Keller, 2003; Payne, Storbacka and Frow, 2008). The model consists of four main components: the\ncustomer\u2019s value-creating process \u2013 concerned with co-creating and experiencing a brand relationship;\nthe supplier\u2019s value-creating process \u2013 concerned with designing and co-creating a brand relationship\nexperience; encounters where (usually) ongoing interactions are involved in creating these experiences;\nand, the impact of additional sources of brand knowledge (Keller, 2003).\nFIGURE 2 HERE\nSeveral streams of theoretical work are reflected in the model including: work by: Gr\u00f6nroos (2000),\nHolbrook and Hirschmann (1982), Korkman (2006), Normann (2001), Normann and Ramirez (1993),\nOliver (1999), Prahalad and Ramaswamy (2000), Storbacka and Lehtinen (2001) and Vargo and Lusch\n(2004) - for the customer value-creating processes; Normann (2001), Pine (1993) and Sawhney (2006),\nStorbacka and Lehtinen (2001) - for the supplier value-creating processes; Ballantyne and Varey\n(2006), Gremler (2004), Gr\u00f6nroos (2006) and Vargo and Lusch (2004) - for encounters; and, Keller\n(2003) - for the additional or secondary sources of brand knowledge. The authors now examine each of\nthese four components in more detail:\nThe customer value-creating process\nThe customer\u2019s processes represent a series of activities through which the customer aims to achieve\na particular purpose. These activities collectively contribute to the brand relationship experience. Figure\n2 shows the key components of the customer value co-creating processes.\n11\nThe brand relationship experience considers two perspectives of consumer behavior, the information-\nprocessing perspective and the experiential perspective including the role of consumer communities and\nuser innovation.\nThe academic literature documents comprehensively the traditional information-processing\nperspective, typically referred to as the C-A-B (cognition, affect and behavior) approach (e.g.,\nThompson and Fine, 1999). This approach views the customer as primarily involved in goal-directed\nactivities including searching, confirmation, evaluating alternative options and deciding whether, or not,\nto buy a particular product. However, some researchers criticize this approach for being too restrictive\nand failing to account for the experiential nature of consumer behavior (e.g., Holbrook and Hirschmann,\n1982). To counter this problem, pioneering consumer researchers propose the experiential or \u201chedonic\u201d\nperspective, where experiential consumption includes the flow of fantasies, feelings and fun in which\nprocesses are more sub-conscious and private in nature (Holbrook and Hirschmann, 1982).\nThis experiential perspective offers especially significant opportunities for co-creation. However,\nelements of information processing such as searching for information, evaluating alternatives and\ngenerating choice sets, can lead to more knowledgeable and better informed customers. The intention is\nto provide customers with knowledge and facts, and for them to make decisions, which encourages\ncustomer involvement in co-creation behaviors. Thus, this C-A-B perspective can provide support for\nsubsequent important co-creative processes such as knowledge sharing and communication. In sum,\nrather than adopting an extreme position on either perspective, the model incorporates a consideration of\nboth perspectives.\nExperiences are especially important as they can encourage the customer to participate increasingly\nin the process of co-creation. Normal, day-to-day service experience and practices (e.g., Edvardsson,\nEnquist and Johnston, 2005; Korkman, 2006) as well as peak experiences (e.g., Pine and Gilmore, 1999)\n12\nboth lead to customer learning, which involves a combination of experiential encounters over the length\nof the relationship. Two perspectives of customer learning are useful. First, using a sense-making,\ncognitive perspective, and second, identifying the experiences embedded in the co-creation process.\nThe literature review highlights the importance of customer communities, customer-to-customer\ninteractions and the role that customers can play in product design and innovation. The customer has the\nopportunity to participate actively in the co-creation process through their innovation and product design\n(e.g., F\u00fcller, Jawecki and M\u00fchlbacher, 2007). In particular, the development of the internet provides\nsubstantial opportunities for online involvement of consumers in product design (e.g., Kamali and\nLoker, 2002).\nOver time, the customer\u2019s ability to co-create is developed, reinforced or altered because of their\nongoing sequence of experiences. External or supplier-initiated factors can cause customers to alter\ntheir behavior and existing practices in adopting new processes \u2013 the model refers to these processes as\ncustomer learning. For example, the processes that retail banks use to help customers understand the\nvalue of switching from branch-based banking to on-line banking illustrate this form of learning. While\nthe benefits of using on-line banking may appear obvious, a cognitive approach based on explanations\nand directions is unlikely to work satisfactorily by itself. Only by engaging the customer in a co-creation\nexperience, and by learning from this experience, is the customer likely to change his or her routinized\nbanking behavior. Suppliers who understand the nature of customer learning can develop processes to\nsupport and improve a customer's capability to co-create.\nThe supplier value-creating process\nThe supplier process should start with a consideration of co-creation opportunities and alternatives.\nResearchers such as Bendapudi and Leone (2003) distinguish between different forms of co-creation\nincluding: the emotional engagement of customers (e.g., through advertising and promotional activities);\n13\nself-service; engaging the customer in an experience (e.g., white-water rafting); using processes to allow\nthe customer to solve their own problems (e.g., self-diagnosis of computer fault on a website); and\nwhere the customer actively engages with the supplier to help design a product, (e.g., Boeing actively\nencourages the involvement of their airline customers in aircraft design). Brand relationship experience\ndesign involves the selection, planning and implementation of value-adding activities and experiences\nfor the customer. Service-dominant logic suggests starting with the customers\u2019 value creation processes\nand identifying which of those processes the supplier has the ability and wishes to support.\nTechniques for understanding the total consumption system of the customer, such as service\nblueprinting (e.g., Kingman-Brundage, 1989), provide the opportunity to add value to the customer's\nbrand experiences. Service blueprints consider the entire design of a service operation as if through the\ncustomers\u2019 eyes (Brown, Fisk and Bitner, 1994). However, this blueprinting technique can often ignore\nthe customer viewpoint (Brooks and Lings, 1996). In undertaking blueprinting, companies should not\ncompromise understanding of customer experiences in service encounters and suppliers should assess\nsuch experiences from a managerial, rather than a customer perspective (Pires, Stanton and Stanton,\n2004). The supplier's challenge is to ensure the service design process produces customer experiences\nthat lead to customer satisfaction, are operationally efficient and facilitate desired outcomes. The\nsupplier needs to take the voice of the customer fully into account, as customer input is critical to\nensuring richer experiences. Pires, Stanton and Stanton (2004) illustrate how suppliers can incorporate\nthe role of customer experiences into the development of service blueprints.\nService-dominant logic distinguishes operand and operant resources. Vargo and Lusch (2004) define\noperand resources as those on which an operation or act is performed to produce an effect; and operant\nresources as ones, such as embedded knowledge and skills (e.g. technology), employed to act on\noperand resources. These operant resources can manifest themselves as core competences, capabilities\n14\nand organizational processes, which are vital to the co-creation of value. Developing knowledge\nmanagement systems that enable an understanding of customer co-creation opportunities is important\nand requires more information from customers than the usual managerial metrics deployed, such as\nmeasures of customer satisfaction, retention rates and customer loyalty. Suppliers need to incorporate a\nfull understanding of the customer\u2019s brand experience and how customers engage with the supplier\u2019s\nproducts and services over time. In particular, the supplier has the opportunity to encourage the\nformation of customer communities and motivate user-innovation and design.\nEncounters\nThe encounters in Figure 2 represent a series of interactions and transactions occurring during the\nrelationship between the customer and supplier. The encounters can occur either on the initiative of the\ncompany (e.g., through an outbound telephone call), or on the initiative of the customer (e.g., via an\nenquiry or complaint); or on the initiative of both (e.g., attending a car auction). Figure 2 represents\nthese encounters through two-way arrows that link supply processes to those of the customer. The\narrows are deliberately two-way, emphasizing a key element of service-dominant logic - increasing co-\ncreation and dialogue within the relationship (Ballantyne and Varey, 2006).\nThe encounters represent processes where both parties are interacting and mutually co-creating\nexperiences. The appropriate form and mix of these co-creative processes will be highly context\nspecific, and will vary based on the nature and length of the relationship. Co-creation involves\nencounters that influence the customer\u2019s ability, willingness and opportunities to co-create with the\nsupplier. Two aspects facilitate the co-creation of a brand: communicating the brand; and acting upon\nthe brand. Either the customer or the supplier, or both (and potentially other stakeholders) may be\ninvolved.\n15\nCertain co-creative encounter processes are generic whilst others are dependent on the nature of the\nsupplier and the supplier\u2019s relationship with the customer base. The encounters can support co-creation\nfrom a cognition point of view aiming at sense making (e.g. \u201cwhy should I involve myself in co-creation\nand what is the meaning of this brand to me?\u201d) and communication of behavioral scripts, customer\npromises, value-explaining messages, outcomes, references and testimonials. Typical examples include\nknowledge sharing (e.g., exchanging user experiences, or sharing experiences of competitive suppliers),\nand creating expertise (e.g., providing and using on-line tutorials for any type of service).\nCo-creation may also be emotion supporting, aiming at either influencing or engaging the customer\n(e.g., how deeply should I be involved with this brand?) with themes, metaphors, stories, analogies,\ndesign elements, new options, surprise or offering forms of customer recognition. Typical examples of\nco-creation processes include emotional engagement (e.g., becoming an active member in supplier-\nmanaged clubs, becoming an advocate for the brand), or positive surprise (e.g., amazing the customer by\ncontinuously offering new and exciting ways to experience the service).\nFinally, the encounters may be action-supporting, enabling the customer to engage in activities such\nas trials, knowledge sharing, self-service activities, and usage of the product. Examples of such\nengagement are quality management (e.g., creating user feedback systems and responding to the\nfeedback), and enabling efficient self-service (e.g., creating easy to use interfaces with mobile devices\nand\/or PC\u2019s). Later in this article, the case study illustrates a number of the above examples.\nCo-creation opportunities represent strategic options for suppliers to create increased brand meaning\nfor customers. These opportunities are based on the context of the individual organization being studied\n(Payne et al., 2008), and include: technological developments opportunities (e.g., opportunities for\ncustomers to directly engage with the supplier or other customers online); changes in industry logics\nopportunities (e.g., the emergence of new competitors may create more excitement and engagement by\n16\ncustomers); and changes in customer preferences and lifestyles opportunities (e.g., environmental\nconcerns are creating incentives for customers to co-create in order to save energy).\nManaging encounters to co-create brands also includes consideration of the content and experiences\nthat are appropriate for different relationship phases. These phases include acquisition, stabilization and\nenhancement. In the beginning of a relationship, there is a greater need to secure the customer\u2019s\nexpertise enabling systematic co-creation. The experienced customer can however, engage more\nholistically in co-creation. Identifying and mapping encounters for each of these phases can help\nunderstand how customers and suppliers each experience their relationship. Managing encounters\ninvolves setting relationship objectives for both customer and supplier, and determining whether such\nencounters are achieving these objectives. The case study introduced later helps explain these planning\nand implementation steps.\nSuppliers can develop successful co-creation initiatives based on customer encounters. They can use\nthese encounters to educate their customers on how to engage in co-creation behaviors. A good example\nis IKEA, whose business model is highly dependent on customers\u2019 co-creation activities. IKEA\u2019s\nmarketing communications strive to teach the customer the wisdom of value co-creation: \u201cIt\u2019s easier to\nsave money when we all lend a hand.\u201d The company\u2019s promotional material and catalog explain in\ndetail how a customer can get the best value from IKEA and its products. Whilst engaging with the\nbrand, IKEA\u2019s customers participate in a number of co-production and co-servicing activities including\ntransportation and assembly.\nAdditional sources of brand knowledge\nThe final component of the model (Figure 2) represents the additional or secondary sources of brand\nknowledge that can affect brand perceptions. Keller (2003) observes any potential encounter with a\nbrand, irrespective of whether or not the encounter is supplier-initiated, \u201chas the opportunity to change\n17\nthe mental representation of the brand and the kinds of information that can appear in the customer\nmemory\u201d. He also points out that with increasingly competitive marketplaces, suppliers must take into\naccount these additional sources of brand knowledge that relate to a range of other stakeholder\ninfluences. These include: customer-to-customer interactions (brand communities and user innovation);\nemployee-to-customer interactions; other stakeholders (such as intermediaries and influencers); third\nparty endorsement and events; places (including channels and origination); and other brands (including\nalliances and extensions).\nMany of these sources of brand knowledge may be present in encounters and, in themselves, provoke\nco-creation processes. For example, customers may be encouraged in active co-creation by becoming\nengaged in brand communities, where customers together invent new uses for goods or services. The\nspread of SMS messaging (first aimed at business users) amongst teenagers is a good example of\ncustomers inventing a new use for a service.\nInclusion of such sources in the model emphasizes the need to consider these broader external\ninfluences on the encounters in the supplier-customer interface. Many researchers (e.g., Balmer, 2006;\nBalmer and Gray, 2003; Dall\u2019Olmo Riley et al., 2000; de Chernatony and Harris, 2000; and Shultz and\nHatch, 2006) endorse the importance of considering this wider range of stakeholders in the context of\nbrands and branding.\nCase Study Research: Co-creating a Brand through Relationship Experience Design\nMany conceptual models developed in the marketing and management academic literature do not\nattempt to illustrate how managers can use such models in a company-specific situation. The authors\naddress this limitation in the second phase of this study, which involves case study research. This\nresearch illustrates the application of the co-creation model in designing and planning a relationship\n18\nexperience that systematically utilizes co-creation opportunities. In identifying a suitable business-to-\nconsumer company for the case study, the researchers developed three criteria. First, to identify a\ncompany with an existing co-creation initiative that capitalizes on at least two of the value co-creation\nopportunities proposed by Payne et al. (2008) - technological developments, changes in industry logics\nand changes in customer preferences and lifestyles. Second, to select a case study that utilized new\ntechnological applications from a novel industry setting - given the marketing literature is replete with\nexamples from industries such as financial services, retailing and hospitality. Finally, given the recent\nemphasis on branding issues relating to sustainability and social responsibility (e.g., Blomqvist and\nPosmer, 2004; Charter, Peattie, Ottman and Polonsky, 2002; Knox and Maklan, 2004; Van Heel,\nElkington and Fennel, 2001), to develop a case study that relates to a sustainable product innovation.\nThe authors compiled a shortlist of alternatives case studies and, after an initial investigation of each\nusing the above selection criteria, they selected a car-sharing club for case study development.\nThe City Car Club\nCar sharing clubs are popular throughout Europe and North America. They offer the means of car\ntransportation, yet overcome the high cost of keeping a car in the city and allow drivers to behave in an\nenvironmentally responsible way. Launched in Helsinki, Finland, in 2000, the City Car Club (CCC)\noffers members an alternative to owning a car. Finland has a reputation for championing \u2018Green\u2019 issues\nand the Club has strong emotive appeal to environmentally concerned individuals who are attracted to\nshared car ownership and usage. On joining the Club, a member has access to a self-selected car at any\ntime and in convenient locations. In addition, CCC offers significant financial advantages, as the rental\nservice only charges for usage and duration. CCC is attractive as a case study because this company\ncapitalizes on at least two of the generic co-creation opportunities outlined above: changing customer\npreferences; and, harnessing technological developments.\n19\nMethodology\nThe main objective of the CCC case is to illustrate how the co-creation model in Figure 2 can be\nutilized for designing, planning and managing a relationship experience that offers enhanced co-creation\nopportunities. Thus, the data generation aimed at providing a rich description of how CCC management\ndeveloped its service and how its customers engage in co-creation. This data generation involved the\ncollection of both primary and secondary data and followed a purposive sampling approach (e.g.\nEisenhardt, 1989; Wallendorf and Belk, 1989), with each respondent group or artifact selected on the\nbasis of previous responses.\nData was gathered from the following sources: three interviews with senior management of the CCC,\nfive interviews with active customers, a customer survey, a focus group of potential customers, customer\nblogs, company data, the CCC website, third party blogs and magazine articles about CCC and car clubs\nin general.\nUsing these sources, the reserachers progressively interpreted the data to adapt the model in Figure 2,\nproviding deeper insights and closer represenation of the CCC brand relationship experience. Initially,\nthe researchers coded specific elements relating particularly to the planning and encounter processes.\nThe subsequent analysis focused on identifying relevant forms of co-creation opportunities, from early\nemotional engagement with the brand to repeat usage of the service and customer feedback systems.\nData was then coded for each phase from the perspective of both the customer and the supplier. This\ndata was then related to the objectives for the three key relationship phases of acquisition, stabilization\nand enhancement (see Figure 3). The authors then used the data to map processes, including the creative\nuse of channels to enhance encounters (see Figure 4). Analysis followed the constant comparative\nmethod (e.g., Glaser and Strauss, 1967), whereby new data was compared to previous interpretations.\n20\nThe authors then reviewed the findings and made decisions about further data required to give a full\ndescription of the brand relationship experience.\nFor example, secondary data was initially used to understand the supplier processes and identify\npossible points of value co-creation. The authors then investigated these points further and collected\nprimary data to give deeper insight into these relationship encounters. The research process was\niterative, therefore, with analysis informing the selection of additional data required to give a full picture\nof the processes involved in co-creation. The authors continued the process until they were confident\nthat they had accurately described the creation of a brand relationship experience. Senior management\nat the City Car Club verified, or \u201cmember checked\u201d, the final version of the model. The case study\ndiscussion on relationship experience design that follows is structured around three components outlined\nin Figure 2 - identifying opportunities for co-creation, planning and implementation.\nCo-creation opportunities\nMany forms of co-creation exist (e.g., Bendapudi and Leone, 2003) and this case study illustrates\nmany of them, including the emotional engagement of the customer (e.g., appeal to environmental\nconcerns); self-service (e.g., customer accessing the service when required); engaging the customer in\nthe experience (e.g., the \u2018fun\u2019 element on accessing the car); and the use of systems to provide expertise\nfor the customer (e.g., on-line tutorial to understand the rental system and experience).\nCo-creation opportunities are apparent throughout the whole of CCC\u2019s relationship with its members.\nThe business proposition is emotionally appealing to environmentally-conscious customers; the Club\nand its members can together impact environmental pollution by reducing car ownership and using\nenvironmentally friendly cars. Car-sharing has the potential to replace five to six private cars and\nresearch suggests that former car owners reduce their energy consumption for transport by some 50%\nwhen they join a car-sharing scheme (Loose, Mohr and Nobis, 2006).\n21\nCCC uses technology creatively, providing several opportunities for co-creation. For instance, the\ncustomer can use their mobile phones to book a car, access the vehicle, complete the rental and pay for\ncar usage. Much of the rental process is self-serve, a feature that reduces cost and adds to the\nconvenience of the service. At the beginning of a rental period, the customer unlocks the vehicle by\ncalling a service number followed by a unique customer pin and the registration number. At the end of\nthe rental, the same number locks the doors and initiates data transfer from the car to the CCC back\noffice systems. These systems accurately record the rental duration, distance travelled and location of\nthe car. The customer\u2019s account is automatically debited, eliminating unnecessary administration by\neither customer or CCC. Additional opportunities exist for further enhancing the value co-creation\nopportunities by using telematics technology for security and information services, in-vehicle safety and\nremote vehicle diagonistics.\nPlanning and developing objectives\nPlanning and developing objectives relating to customer management forms an important initial part\nin designing the relationship experience. Planning for co-creation commences with an understanding of\ncustomer processes and how they may vary across different market segments. Successful\nimplementation of plans require cross-functional alignment between the organizational functions\ninvolved in creating and delivering brand experience throughout the relationship phases of customer\nacquisition, stabilization and further development. Setting objectives for both customer and supplier\nlearning at each of the phases and evaluating whether the current set of encounters are achieving these\naims can build superior relationship experiences. Figure 3 outlines a set of objectives for CCC itself and\nthe Club members.\nFIGURE 3 HERE\n22\nThe aim of planning is to identify and design the various activities involved in building the\nrelationship experience. For example, during the acquisition phase, an important issue for CCC is\nidentifying how to appeal to potential members. Conveying the functional and emotional benefits of\nClub membership, such as the environmental and cost advantages, helps create this appeal. CCC has\nidentified triggers for changing the behavior of prospective members by switching car owners to car\nsharing. Promotional messages may focus on creating meanings such as: \u201cUsing car sharing you can\nmake a difference in reducing pollution, energy consumption, traffic noise and road accidents\u201d; or, \u201cCar\nsharing means that you do not have to worry about car insurance payments, car use taxes, maintenance\nvehicle outlay and value depreciation costs, changing tyres and oil, washing the car inside and out,\nannual roadworthiness checks , obtaining and paying for private parking space, etc.\u201d. In addition to\nappealing to prospective members, processes for joining CCC need to work efficiently. The process of\nbecoming a CCC member is efficient, with easy-to-use systems that accurately collect customer data by\nan on-line application process.\nDuring the stabilization phase, both CCC and member interact to learn how best to develop the\nrelationship. For example, at the start of the first transaction, the Club provides a short tutorial on the\nCar Club rental process. This tutorial helps the customer understand how to gain the maximum value out\nof the membership, whilst reducing the number of service problems the company may need to resolve.\nA key aspect of the Club\u2019s use of the Internet application is that users are given control, choice and\nengagement with the service, helping them to willingly participate in co-creating value. For example,\nthe booking system is simple and clear so customers can easily reserve their chosen vehicle at a\ndesignated time and place.\nAt the enhancement phase, CCC seeks to provide brand enhancement and further opportunities for\nco-creation. CCC collects customer information and uses this data to provide additional benefits for\n23\nmembers. Long term members have the option of upgrading to a Silver Membership with reduced rates\nand car upgrades. Also, CCC partners with a hospitality company focusing on leisure destinations, in\norder to offer accommodation and car packages at attractive destinations.\nImplementation\nHaving defined objectives for each of the relationship phases (customer acquisition, stabilization, and\nenhancement), the next step involves identifying the sequential encounters within each phase to\ndetermine how experiences can best be co-created. This step requires an understanding of what kinds of\nencounters best support customer learning and enables customers to play an active role in co-creation\nand achieve the desired objectives. Also, this step requires a consideration of the optimum use of\nchannels which involves evaluating the costs of different channels and identifying how they can best be\nused to achieve customer and company objectives. Figure 4 illustrates a simple mapping process for\nCCC.\nFIGURE 4 HERE\nThe encounter process identifies the interactions and transactions occurring between the customer\nand supplier determining how they can enhance value co-creation. As suggested earlier, there are several\npossible approaches to the mapping process (e.g., Gr\u00f6nroos, 2003; Kingman-Brandage, 1989; Pires,\nStanton and Stanton, 2004; Sawhney et al., 2004). The objective is to identify co-creation opportunities\nincluding: highlighting points of service failure; identifying processes for service recovery; improving\nthe encounter experience; and, where necessary, re-engineering processes.\nCCC uses the online and mobile channels innovatively, for co-creation at several points during the\nencounter process. For example, the car booking system operates through mobile channels as well as on-\nline. These are both efficient, cost effective channels for CCC, and customers can access them\nconveniently. The system gives instant information on car availability, optimising use of the car fleet\n24\nand giving customers immediate information on car choice. A further enhancement has recently been\nadded, with an SMS service informing the customer when the previous user returns their reserved car.\nThe elegance of the CCC concept lies in the simplicity the company has engineered into many\noperations, the sophistication of information technology systems, and the organisation\u2019s ability to\nchange or upgrade processes.\nDesigning specific encounters\nThe mapping activity described above provides the structure for the next step of designing a specific\nencounter that supports the brand co-creation opportunity. Figure 5 illustrates this process for CCC. In\nthis example, the encounter of opening the car doors is analysed to identifying how co-creation can be\noptimised. The process includes identifying: the goal of the encounter (successful pick-up of the car);\nensuring the CCC branding is visible (e.g., prominent use of the logo on the car windscreen and in\nidentifying the parking space); content (customer dials into automated system and, using a pin, accesses\nthe car - the doors open automatically); input (system updates car reservation); output (system updates\ncar information at the start of rental period); channel (mobile phone); service-scape (parking area\ntidiness, etc.); a \u2018catch\u2019or special feature that creates positive customer emotions (the amazement of the\ncustomer at the automatic opening of car doors); and responsibility (identify the functional area of the\norganisation responsible for encounter activity).\nFIGURE 5 HERE\nDesigning a specific encounter, such as this procedure for opening the doors, involves considerable\ninnovation. The importance of this encounter lies in providing an opportunity that is likely to delight\nand differentiate the customer experience. In this example, the customer accesses the central locking\nsystem of the car on a mobile phone, using a designated unique number, and the doors of the car open by\nthemselves. This experience surprises and amuses customers using the service for the first time. The\n25\nencounter is one that they will often recount to others. This experience represents the fun component of\nexperiental brands (Holbrook and Hirschann, 1982). The car keys are located in the glove box and the\ncustomer is now ready to enjoy their car hire experience. For example, a customer describes this\nexperience in a blog as follows: \u201cThey have parking areas all around the capital area, mostly\nconcentrated on areas with high population density. The keys are left in the car, and you can open the\ncar with your cell phone, no problem there!\u201d\nAdditional influences on the brand experience\nCCC has chosen to position itself as a \u201cClub\u201d and calls customers \u201cmembers\u201d. The membership\ncreates emotional bonds (Liljander and Strandvik, 1995) with, and amongst the customers. CCC\nencourages members to share their experiences of the brand in order to build a sense of community\namongst members. Members can learn about other opportunities for brand enhancement, which may\ninfluence their brand experience and enhance value. For example, the web site offers information about\nother members of the community and identifies the profile of various customers, including how each one\nuses the membership services. Members can browse these and learn how others in the community enjoy\nthe service, adding to their own experience. The web site also provides examples of typical cost savings\nfor members, profiled by typical car usage patterns.\nCCC encourages members to participate in a \u2018Car-Free-Day\u2019, a Finnish Government initiative aimed\nat encouraging responsible transportation decisions. This initiative helps build a sense of community\naround environmentally responsible social behavior. A shared sense of moral responsibility and\nparticipative experiences help define these communities and social networks (Achrol and Kotler, 2006).\nIn addition, the CCC web site lists business members, with links given to each company\u2019s web site. This\nlist of business members, benefits both the club (through member endorsement) and individual business\nmembers (through promotion of their business).\n26\nCCC reports a number of practical co-creation consequences resulting from customers viewing\nthemselves as members. First, customers generally treat the cars with considerable care. They\nexperience \u201ccar ownership\u201d and, hence, customers drive the cars more carefully and return them cleaner\nthan a typical rental car. Members also typically leave the petrol tank at least a quarter full. Often\nmembers use the same car, parked in the same parking place on many subsequent occasions. They\nquickly realize that neighborhood members reciprocate with considerate treatment of the car.\nSecond, the members are involved in co-creation by providing valuable feedback to CCC. The\ncompany has two main feedback systems and they have designed encounters for this purpose.\nSpontaneous feedback is encouraged on the website, and CCC reports that most of this feedback is very\nconstructive. The feedback typically relates to the improvement of the service process. CCC records this\ndata into a \u201cdevelopment tree\u201d, which is structured around internal processes. CCC uses this member\nfeedback as an input for the continuous development of service processes and procedures. A further type\nof feedback is a survey that CCC conducts every year. This survey not only measures customer\nsatisfaction, but also aims at understanding the actual behavior of different member groups. The survey\nis web-based and over 40% of the members respond, providing CCC with very valuable insights about\nmembers\u2019 requirements. This survey identifies how a member uses the car, where they want to pick it\nup, their destination and the type of car they need. The survey information is cross-tabulated with actual\ntransaction data and creates a basis for organizational learning.\nThird, CCC sometimes offers the most frequent users certain services (such as travel packages,\ntickets to concert, etc.) at favorable prices through a third party. Members taking up such offers can meet\nand interact with each other without any additional effort by CCC. During these events, members share\ntheir experiences with each other, and with non-members, thus reinforcing their brand community\nexperience and at the same time performing the job of \u201cpart-time marketers\u201d.\n27\nAnother important influence on the brand experience is the impact of social trends. Some people\nmay regard car ownership as a status symbol and an extension of their personality because of a car\u2019s\nvisibility and association with affluence. However, as fashion trends move towards simplicity in\nlifestyle, ownership of expensive cars is less appealing. Also, lobby groups are putting pressures on\ngovernment to make car use more difficult and expensive. A recent customer suggests that by joining\nthe car club: \u201cYou will be able to bask in the admiration of your friends and neighbours, not just for\nbeing so clever, but for doing your bit to save the planet\u201d.\nFindings from the case study\nThe case illustrates the process of co-creating a brand by designing and managing the relationship\nexperience. The authors identify three relationship phases, each with distinctive objectives. Identifying\nspecific aims help CCC design co-creation opportunities appropriate to each relationship phase,\nincluding specific encounters where customer and supplier processes meet. Critically, the case identifies\nthe importance of additional sources of brand knowledge, which influence the value created by the brand\nrelationship. In this example, environmental concerns create empathy amongst users and willingness to\nparticipate in a self-serve relationship experience.\nIn summary, the CCC case illustrates an innovative service that capitalizes on opportunities for\nco-creation and provides Club members of its community with a flexible solution to the practical and\nenvironmental problems of car ownership at a lower cost than traditional car rental. Positioning the\nbrand as a Club allows CCC to engage with customers in co-creation. CCC supports this co-creation in\na systematic way where customers can learn to use the service more effectively and, in turn, CCC learns\nfrom Club members how to better support them. Several opportunities make co-creation possible,\nincluding an innovative combination of new technology and a successful alignment with other\nstakeholders who provide resources supporting the relationship. These other stakeholders include\n28\nmunicipalities (parking spaces), car manufacturers (low-emission cars), technology providers (such as\ntelecommunications companies), and third party vendors (value-adding components).\nSummary and Discussion\nMany researchers point to the need for more work in the area of co-creation, relationships, customer\nexperience and branding. Keller and Lehmann (2006) highlight brand relationships and customer\nexperience as key areas requiring further development. Schroeder and Salzer-M\u00f6rling (2006) emphasize\nthat understanding brands \u201crequires integrative thinking, drawing from management strategy,\norganization theory, and consumer behaviour, and that understanding brands requires theoretical work\u201d.\nThis current study represents a step in this direction by integrating such literatures into a conceptual\nmodel for designing and planning the customer experience involved in co-creating brands.\nThis article examines the co-creation of value in the context of service-dominant logic, proposes a\nconceptual model of co-creation for managing brand relationship experiences and develops a case study\nabout an innovative service which utilizes opportunities for co-creation that reflect changing consumer\npreferences and new developments in mobile technology. The article makes a theoretical and practical\ncontribution to the emerging literature on the brand relationship experience.\nThe article\u2019s theoretical contribution is in developing and refining a model for understanding the\nbrand relationship experience in the context of service-dominant logic. The traditional information-\nprocessing stream of consumer research emphasizes cognition, affect and behavior in a narrow sense.\nResearchers need also to consider a broader context when exploring the brand relationship experience.\nHolbrook and Hirschman (1982) conclude that while an information processing approach explains much\nof buyer behavior, an experiential perspective of encounters can often be greatly enriching. The article\ncategorizes encounters based on the opportunity to support co-creative processes as emotion-supporting\n29\nencounters, cognition-supporting encounters and action-supporting encounters, and proposes that\nmanagement needs to understand how to design such encounters to enable the co-creation of brands.\nThe article makes a practical contribution through the development of a case study illustrating the\napplication of the co-creation model. The case research explores the building of brand experiences by\nsetting goals for both customer and supplier at each relationship phase; mapping the types of encounters\nand determining which channels are most appropriate for different customer segments; and developing a\ndetailed process outline for managing each individual encounter.\nVon Krogh and Roos (1996) argue that success in the field of management hinges on an ability to\ndevelop concepts that are useful to managers. The conceptual approach discussed in this article has been\ndeveloped and tested with senior executives in several companies as part of an interactive research\nprocess. These managers judged the model to be a practical and useful tool in helping them co-create the\nbrand relationship experience with their customers. In addition, some companies are using the model for\nassisting the training of employees involved in the design and delivery of experiential service\nencounters. The authors have also undertaken some preliminary work in seeking out the views of\nconsumers as to the relevance of the model for co-creation. Focus group research among eighteen\npotential consumers of the CCC revealed that, when briefed on the model, group members were able to\ngenerate a greater number of opportunities for co-creation than when they considered co-creation\nopportunities in the absence of such a stimulus. These potential consumers were enthusiastic about the\nvalue of the model and how its components helped them identify opportunities for co-creation.\nAs with most research, the study has limitations, which point to future research opportunities. First,\nthe current research relating to the brand experience has, as its major focus, the business-to consumer\nsector. The business-to-business sector requires further research as the decision making process will add\ncomplexity to the value creation process. Second, the case research reported here focuses on just one\n30\norganization in the business-to-consumer sector. Further case studies applying the co-creation model to\nother business-to-consumer organizations represent an opportunity for future work. Third, the study only\nincorporates a small focus group of customers. Future opportunities exist in involving consumers more\nextensively in such research.\nThe case study also raises interesting research possibilities with respect to aligning brands more\nclosely with sustainability and environmental cause-related issues. Gordon (2002) observes, \u201cWe are\ndrawn to brands we trust, brands that are different from the rest, brands that are innovative, brands that\nappeal to the emotions.\u201d Investigations of brands that appeal strongly to the growing demand for goods\nand services that are sustainable and reduce owners\u2019 emotional and financial costs warrant special\nresearch attention.\nDespite a considerable number of contributions to the service-dominant logic debate, including\nspecific work on co-creation, there remain significant opportunities to research customer experiences\nand how they can contribute to understanding brand management in a service-dominant environment.\nAlthough the application of service-dominant logic to branding is at an early stage of development, the\nauthors suggest the topic shows much promise as a research area and concur with Prahalad\u2019s (2004)\nview of the co-creation perspective where the brand becomes the experience.\n31\nFigure 1: Overview of Model Development Process\nFigure 2: A model for Co-Creating the Brand Relationship Experience\n32\nFigure 3: City Car Club: Objectives for Relationship Phases\nFigure 4: City Car Club: Relationship Encounter Design\n33\nFigure 5: City Car Club: Designing a Specific Encounter\nMobile phone, parking spaceChannel\nSticker on the car with the club logo, speech on automatic answer service,\nsign at parking spaceBrand visibilty\nStreet, parking space, car (type, tidiness, age, size etc.)Service-scape\nOPENING THE CAR DOORS\nWhich part of the organization is responsible for the encounter?Responsibility\nPositive feelings raised by the amazement of seeing the car doors opening\n\u201cby themselves\u201d.\nThe call initiates the usage fee \u201ccalculator\u201d which stops by returning the car.\nCatch\nThe start-time of the car usage, which is needed to calculate the usage fee.Output\nData on customer\u2019s reservation (date, time, pick-up location)Input\nCustomer calls 0200 8811, the automatic answer service greets him and\ngives directions.
