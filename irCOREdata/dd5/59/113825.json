INTRODUCTION \nMultiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems are \nknown to perform better than single link wireless com- \nmunication systems, by employing multiple transmit, and \noptionally, multiple receive antennas 111. Several architec- \ntures have been proposed to exploit the potential of MIMO \nsystems, amongst which are space-time trellis coded modu- \nlation, space-time block codes and layered space-time archi- \ntectures. All of these provide high data rates with a given \ntransceiver complexity. With 3G systems and beyond re- \nquiring high data rates for applications such as multimedia, \nthis particular area has gained a lot of research interest. \nBarring complexity issues, space-time trellis codes \n(STTC) have shown to outperform other space-time coded \nsystems. Tarokh introduced the concept of STTC as an ex- \ntension to the conventional time-convolutional coding, and \nderived criteria to obtain optim,al codes for slow Rayleigh \nfading channels 121. The codes are hand derived and not op- \ntimal.\u2019 Optimal codes can only be obtained by considering \nthe code design criteria against all possible combinations \nof the coefficients in the generator (G-) matrix. However, \nwhen constructing codes for high number of transmit an- \ntennas with high modulation indices, t,he full search in- \ncreases drastically and therefore also increasing the code \nsearch time. This may result in a few billion combinations \nof the generator matrix. For instance, a 4-PSK code with \n2 transmit antennas and 16 states has 12 different coeffi- \ncients in the generator matrix. This implies having 4\u201c, \ni.e. 16,777,216 combinations. The equivalent scenario for \na 5-antenna 4-PSK code results i n  43u combinat,ions in the \nG-matrix, i.e. 1,152,921,504,606,846,976 combinations!! \nIn the following, we propose two novel ways aimed at \nsignificantly reducing the code search, but yet obtaining \noptimal codes. Evaluating the difference matrix [Z] or the \nconjugate of the difference matrix, results in the same pa- \nrameters of interest in the distance matrix, when satisfying \nt.he code design criteria. Hence, in the first method, we \nscrutinize the symmetry in the constellations and succeed \nto half the number of combinations when performing a full \ncode search. The second method is based on the mathe- \nmatical proof that for a particular set of coefficients sys- \ntematically aligned in the G-matrix, where each column in \nthe G-matrix represents coefficients for a certain transmit \nantenna, interchanging t,he columns and performing the en- \ncoding operation yields the same results. Hence reducing \nthe code search, by the factorial of t,he number of h n s m i t  \nan tenna  under consideration. A significant reduction in \nthe code search can be achieved by combining the above \ntwo methods. \nThe rest of the paper is organised a follows. The sys- \ntem model employed for performing a full code search is \npresented in Section 11. In Section I11 we introduce the \ncode design criteria for various diversity orders on quasi- \nstatic Rayleigh fading channels. Novel ways of reducing \nthe full code search are discussed in-depth in Section IV. \nIn Section V, an example on the effectiveness of the code \nreduction is presented. In Section VI we present novel code \ncoefficients, obtained using our proposed method for slow \nRayleigh fading channels for five and six transmit anten- \nnas with 16 and 32 transitional states. The performance \nof these novel codes are examined by simulation in Sec- \ntion VII, as well as in CDMA systems. Conclusions are \ngiven in Section VIII. \n11. SYSTEM MODEL FOR SPACE-TIME CODE SEARCH \nWe consider a mobile communications system where the \ntransmitter is equipped with n7 antennas and a receiver \nwith nn antennas. The signals are assumed to undergo \nindependent flat Rayleigh fading between the transmit and \nthe receive antennas. It is assumed that the path gains are \nconstant during one frame and change from one frame to \nthe other (quasi-static fading) \nA two-branch feed-forward shift register with memory \norder U is used to model the 4-PSK STTC encoder with \nnr transmit antennas [3]. The input to the STTC encoder \nis a sequence of hits that is divided into two streams at \nany time t ,  creating 1: and 2;  1: being the most signif-, \nicant bit, and I\u2019 the least significant. The\u2019two streams \nof input hits are then simultaneously multiplied by coeffi-: \ncients (a;, a:, . . . , a,\u201dT),(bA, b z , .  , , , b;=) respectively, where \n66 \nthe superscript of the coefficients represents the antenna \nnumber and the subscript represents the delay in the en- \ncoder, p = 0 , 1 , .  . . VI, q = 0,1,. . . VZ, with vi = 1-1, \ni = 1,2,  and ab, bbc{O,  1 , 2 , 3 }  for 4-PSK modulation. The \nresulting data  is added in modulo 4 .  \nThis encoding operation can he expressed in matrix- \nmultiplication form xi = 1.  G where xt = (x:,x:,. . . ,.;\") \nis the output from each antenna x', i = 1 ,2 , .  . . nT , a i  \ntime t ,  I is the input bit-vector and G is defined as the \ngenerator matrix, where each of its columns represents the \ncoefficients for .each transmit antenna. Here, the caeffi- \ncients in the G-matrix are arranged in an alternative form, \nsuch that for a 4-state code with 5 antennas it would he \nrepresented as: \n111. CODE DESIGN CRITERIA FOR QUASI-STATIC \nRAYLEICH FADING CHANNELS \nHaving transmitted codeword c, = (c:,c:, . . . , cyT), an er- \nror occurs when the decoder makes an erroneous decision \nand chooses et = (e:, e:, . . . ,e?)  as the most likely code- \nword. The dafference matrix B is then represented as \nthe corresponding codewords c and e:  \nof the system is four or more, the upper bound o n  the \nminimum pairwise error probability is given by [5]: \nHence, we may optimise the coding gain by maximising \nthe trace of the distance matrix, A. \nIv. REDUCING THE CODE SEARCH \nA .  Novel Code Search Criteria: Method 1 \nThe first method for reducing the code search whilst ob- \ntaining optimal codes is based on the fact that  when per- \nforming a full search with all possible codewords and all \npossible Error Event Paths (EEPs) for each set of coeffi- \ncients, we duplicate the search by evaluating the mirror \nimage of the difference matrix, i.e., we make calculations \non the complex conjugate of the difference matrix. This is \nbecause for the same set of coefficients, we interchange with \nthe codeword being the EEP and vice versa, and effectively \ndo the same calculations on B and B*. All possible com- \nbinations of the codeword and EEP have to he taken into \naccount due to the geometrical non-uniformity of codes 161. \nWe now ensure that reducing the code search in such a way \ndoes not affect obtaining optimal codes. \nTheorem 1: Satisfying the criteria for obtaining optimal \nSTTC from B .  or the coniuaate of B. i.e.. B': results in .. - . .  . \nthe same values of interest from the distance matrix A .  \ntain the following using (3) \nProof: Considering the complex conjugate of B', we oh- i A' = ( B .  BH)* ( 6 )  e; - ci e: - c: . .  . e t  - c2 e:T - 4' - cy' . . . e,L, - cnLT e ; - . ;  e : - . :  . . .  e; - c; B(c,e) = \n( 2 )  \nThe distance mat& A ,  is the Euclidean distance be- \ntween the corresponding codewords t,ransmitted at each \ntime from each transmit antenna nT, and the erroneous \ncodeword. I t  is obtained by performing the fallowing: \nA = B . B ~  (3) \nwhere H denotes the Hermitian (transpose conjugate). \nFor slow Rayleigh fading channels, when the diversity \norder of the system is three or less, where the diversity \norder is defined as the product of the number of transmit \nand receive antennas, an upper bound on the pairwise error \nprobability is given by [Z], 131: \nwhere A; are the eigenvalues and r the rank of the distance \nmatrix A (explained in IV), n R  is the number of receive \nantennas, E, is the energy per symbol a t  each transmit \nantenna, and N, is the noise spectral density. Hence, we \nmay optimise the coding gain by maximising the minimum \ndeterminant of the distance matrix, obtained over all com- \nbinations of distinct codewords. When the diversity order \nA is Hermitian 121, therefore we obtain the same rank, \nsame eigenvalues and same determinant of A and A'. Since \nthe trace is simply the sum of the eigenvalues 171, both \ndesign criteria for slow fading channels are unaffected by \nthis code reducing method. \nB. Novel Code Search Criteria: Method 2 \nWhen performing a code search on the coefficients in the \nG-matrix, where each column represents the coefficients \nfor a particular transmit antenna, we effectively repeat the \ncolumns of the G-matrix hut in a different order. Hence, we \ncan reduce the full code search by the factorial of the num- \nber of columns, i.e., number of transmit antennas, as long \nas  it does not affect the parameters of interest when sat- \nisfying the criteria for obtaining optimal space-time codes \nfor both slow and fast fading environments. This is proven \nin the following theorem. \nTheorem 2 : Interchanging the rows of the difference ma- \ntrix does not influence the criteria for obtaining optimum \nSTTC, and results in the same values of interest from the \nA matrix. \nProof: Consider swapping the first and second columns \nof the G-matrix, this implies interchanging first two rows \nof the B matrix, which results in, say. B' \n67 \nI ,  \nwhere B' is a permutation of B along the rows.The same \nprinciple holds for (BH) '  and B H  hut along the columns, \nsince Hermitian includes a transpose. When calculating \nthe distance matrix A', the multiplication is commutative \nand we obtain the following \nA' = (B.BH) '  (8) \nwhere A' is a permutation of A along the rows and the \ncolumns. \nWe now look a t  how these changes in the distance ma- \ntrix A' affect the parameters of interest when constructing \ncodes. Firstly, we evaluate the det,erminant of A'. Swap- \nping, once only, any two rows or columns of matrix results \nin the same determinant multiplied by -1  [71. hence \nthe added 4 coefficients that has 44 = 256 combinations, \nHence the total number of combinations are 48 + 44 = \n65,792 combinations. \nUsing the first method proposed here, which halves the \ncode search, we have $= 8,3881G08 combinations. With \nthe second proposed method, the code search is reduced by \nthe factorial of the number of antennas, and we'carry out \nthe search on $ = 2,796,203 combinations of G .  Comhin- \ning the two novel methods results in 1,398,101 comhina- \ntions. This number is significantly lower than the number \nof full code search combinations but higher than the suh- \noptimal method; however it guarantees obtaining optimum \nspace-time trellis codes. \nVI. NOVEL SPACE-TIME CODES O B T A I N E D  USING THE \nREDUCED SEARCH CRITERIA \nUsing a comhination if our proposed methods, new 4- \nPSI< codes are obtained. In Table I below, STTCs codes for \n16 and 32 transitional states for slow fading channels, and \nvarying number df transmit, antennas are reported. The \ncoefficients in the tables represent the G-matrix and are \nread as in (1). \nd e t A  = ( - l ) \" d e t ( A ' )  (9) \nwhere n is the number of permutations and n E N .  \nSince there are k permutations on the columns of G, \nwhich result:in k permutations on the rows of B.  When \nevaluating EH, we inevitably make k permutations on its \ncolumns. Therefore, A and A' will always differ from each \nother by 2k permutations. Hence, n is always even and the \nfollowing always holds: \nd e t A  = d e t ( A ' )  (IO) ~ \n'Furthermore. anv two matrices .differine bv two inter- \n02212 \n13202 \n22020 \n21123 \n02232 1 13;2 220;13 1 222;l 231200 22112 332322 022022 ' 30223 121210 312122 01223 221203 220231 30132 032110 12002 302032 \n48 44 52 \nTABLE I , \"  \" l  \nchanged rows or columns have t,he same rank. \nWhen the diversity order of the system is 4 or more, we \nevaluate the,trace of the distance matrix A .

Hence, evaluating the trace of A or A' give \nthe same result. \n. .  \nv. COMPARING THE METHODS FOR R E D U C I N G  F U L L  \nCODE SEARCH \nIn the following we consider an example to compare the \ncode-search reduction methods. To obtain codes for a 3- \nantenna, 4-state, 4-PSK code via a full search, there are \n4\" = 16,777,216 combinations in the generator matrix. \nUsing the known sub-optimal method [4], we first do  a \nfull search on the 2-antenna, 4-PSK, 4-state case, which \nhas 4' = 65,536 comhinabions, and t,hen a full search an \nVII.  CODE PERFORMANCE \nThe code performance is evaluated by simulation and de- \nscribed by frame error rate (FER). Each frame consists of \n130 symbols rransmitted from each transmit antenna, and \nideal channel state information is assumed a t  the receiver. \nThe performance curves are plotted against the signal-to- \nThe simulation results in Fig. 1 show that  the codes for \n16-states with nT = 6 are superior to the ones of n 7  = 5, \nand the codes with nT = 5 have better performance com- \npared t o  the corresponding ones in 141. An improvement \nof around 0.9 and 0.6 dR is observed a t  the FER of 10-2 \nwhen ny is increased from four to five, and from five to six \nrespectively. Correspondingly. less gains in performance \nare observed when increasing the number of receive anten-. \nnes. The  4-antenna code is from [4] and is included for \nreference only. Similar observations are observed for the \n32-state codes in 2.  \nnoise ratio (SNR) per receive antenna. . .  \n68 \nY \n8 \nY \nI \nI \nB \ni \nFig. 1.
