The example of iron industry shows that many new ideas and skills \nflowed into India from Europe, but not all met with commercial success. The essay suggests that \nin those fields in which the costs of complementary factors were relatively low, the chance of \nsuccess was higher. This condition was present in the craft of the blacksmith, in which the main \ncomplementary input was craftsmanship. The condition was slow to develop in iron-smelting, \nwhere the costs of fuel, labour, capital, and carriage of ore were high in the mid-nineteenth \ncentury. \n \nAcknowledgment \nI have benefited greatly from detailed comments received from two readers of the journal. An \nearlier version of the paper was presented in the Economic History Seminar series, Carlos III \nUniversity, Madrid. I wish to thank the participants in the seminar for a stimulating and \nproductive discussion. \n1 \n \n Did colonialism and globalization aid or obstruct industrial development in nineteenth \ncentury India?1 In historical scholarship, two models of the impact of globalization usually occur \ntogether to form what we may call the received view on this question. One of these draws a \npicture of an accelerated integration in commodity trade, and the other draws a picture of an \nobstructed or distorted integration in technological knowledge. The former model follows the \nneoclassical framework in suggesting that the first globalization imposed a new division of \nlabour upon India, one that destroyed manufacturing and stimulated the production and export of \nprimary goods.2 By and large, the received view reads the growth implications of the pattern of \nchange in a pessimistic vein, drawing a link between trade, \u2018peasantization\u2019, and \nunderdevelopment.3 The second model deals with construction of knowledge, skill, and \ncapability. In this view, the colonial state, deliberately or otherwise, obstructed the development \nof indigenous capability. In one strand, it did so by means of a preference for technological \nchoices that favoured expatriate capital at the cost of domestic capital.4 In another, it did so by \nmeans of a biased system of education, the purpose of which \u2018was not .. transfer of Western ideas \nand artifacts, but .. transfer of loyalties\u2019, together with destruction of indigenous handicrafts, \nconsequently weak market-based transfer of knowledge, and overall, the formation of an \n\u2018enclavist\u2019 industrial system.5\nThe economic history of iron and steel production in India seems to illustrate the received \nview particularly well. Historical scholarship on iron is well-developed.6 Most contributors to \nthis literature implicitly share a point of view holding that a traditional industry died out due to \nforeign competition, there was loss of indigenous knowledge as a result, and the modern industry \nusing western knowledge experienced a difficult start because of obstacles posed by the colonial \n2 \n \nstate.7 Modern industrialization, in this view, became possible when the imperial government \nreversed its obstructive stance out of political self-interest. \nBy gathering primary material so far under-utilized in the scholarship, and by drawing a \ncontrast between iron-making and hardware, the present paper offers a different understanding of \nthe effect of economic integration on the iron industry. The interest of the paper is mainly in the \nnineteenth century, when European artisans and traded machinery exerted a visible influence on \nindigenous manufacturing practices. The paper shows that the iron industry saw both failed and \nsuccessful cases of knowledge transfer. These failures and successes were not connected with the \npolicies of the state, but with conditions of factor markets. \nThe alternative story consists of three propositions. First, in common with many other \nartisanal industries, in iron, destruction was pronounced in input manufacture (smelting) and \nsubdued in final consumer goods (blacksmiths). In the latter case, significant instances of \nsuccessful knowledge transfer can be found. Second, as one would expect in an industry in \nwhich early modern Western Europe had an acknowledged lead, there was translocation of \nartisanal knowledge of iron-making, mainly via migration of artisans. This process created \nknowledge about Indian iron in the public domain that contributed to the success of later modern \nfirms. However, in most instances, translocation ended in commercial failure. \nThird, both the success of knowledge transfer (blacksmiths), and the lack of success of \nknowledge transfer (smelters), can be explained with reference to a single set of variables, cost \nof complementary inputs. Technological choices take place within a context set by conditions of \nfactor markets. Successful adoption of a new idea requires the costs of complementary inputs to \nbe relatively low. In iron smelting, the principal complementary inputs were wood fuel, ore, and \ntransportation. All of these costs were high in nineteenth century India, and rising in some cases. \n3 \n \nMining and mass transportation were relatively undeveloped, and costly because of the terrain. \nCharcoal was becoming dearer. Even labour costs turned out to be high for the smelters, due to \ninsufficient growth of a labour market. With blacksmiths, however, the only major \ncomplementary input was skilled craftsmanship, which could be found in abundance in India. \nMuch knowledge came in embodied in cheap tools, which were quickly adopted and reproduced. \nWhereas large-scale smelting was a relatively capital-intensive process, smithy was not. And \ntherefore, cost of capital mattered little in this sphere. \nThe rest of the paper is divided into four sections. The next section takes a brief tour of \nthe relevant historiography, and proposes that the interpretation of iron history developed here \ncan be generalized to other industries, and is more consistent with concepts of globalization in \neconomic theory and economic history. The other two sections deal with the smelters and smiths, \nrespectively. The last section offers concluding observations and returns to the question the paper \nopens with. \n \nHistoriography \nThe motivation for the paper derives from some recent research on artisans that advance a \nmore differentiated narrative of globalization than the received view allows for. This scholarship \nacknowledges that mass produced inputs such as cotton yarn suffered a quick substitution of \nhandmade for imported machine-made product in the nineteenth century. But it points out that \nhandloom weaving saw extensive survival in spite of the fact that imported cloth cost much less \nto buy. The survival is explained with reference to two factors. On the demand side, product \ndifferentiation, consumption preferences in clothing, and the availability of highly skilled \ncraftsmanship allowed handloom weavers to continue making non-standard goods for consumer \n4 \n \nmarkets. On the supply side, importation of artisanal technologies embodied in tools, machines \nand processes, reduced costs of production, increased productivity, and enhanced economies of \nscope.8\nThe textile example not only qualifies the received view, but also connects better with \ncurrent interpretations of globalization within economic theory and history. In the spirit of trade \ntheories that emphasize the role of product differentiation, it is possible to suggest that \ndifferentiation and consumer preference sustained demand for specific skills, including artisanal \nskills.9 The impact of imported machine-made goods was destructive upon generic industrial \ninputs; and muted, at times creative, upon the manufacture of non-standard niche-market \nconsumption articles, especially those that demanded some form of craftsmanship. And in the \nspirit of new theories of growth, the revision proposes that knowledge spillover occurred in the \ncourse of integration in factor markets, and that, if knowledge exchange and domestic capability \nconflicted in some fields, there were also fields wherein they were compatible.10\nEconomic history, which shares with new theories of growth an interest in knowledge, \ndiscusses four processes by which globalization creates capability across national borders: \nmigration of skilled individuals, foreign investment, state and institutional intervention, and trade \nin machinery.11 In the early modern world, mobile knowledge relied mainly on migration of \nskilled artisans.12 In the postwar world, the multinational company and partnership between \ndomestic business and the developmental state keen to direct private technological choices have \nplayed large roles.13 In the time spanned by these two regimes, the main channel of knowledge \ntransfer was trade in machinery. In the case of nearly all examples of \u2018late\u2019 industrialization \nfounded upon a cotton textile mill industry, the nineteenth century beginning saw importation of \nmachinery and the foremen to operate these, and the interwar maturation saw import-substitution \n5 \n \nin personnel, machines, and spare parts. In addition to these market-mediated channels, in India, \nthe imperial connection facilitated state-mediated knowledge transfers as well; the major \ninstances studied include the stationary steam engine, the telegraph, engineering education, and \nthe railways.14\nThe meanings historians of India draw from these examples vary, however. Railways \ngreatly reduced costs of bulk transportation. Did it also foster knowledge transfer? In one view, \nthe buy-British policy followed in the procurement of railway rolling stock in the prewar phase \nrestricted the backward linkages of railway development.15 In a more positive view, the \nspillovers of railways were significant, if not on equipment, on construction; and they were \nincreasing, as the British standards were modified in favour of the more practicable Indian \nones.16 The cotton textile mill industry was built with the help of Lancashire machinery, \ntechnical manpower, and standards. Persistence with British standards has been seen in one \ninterpretation to have led to a dysfunctional regime in spinning in the late nineteenth century.17 \nOn the other hand, the close contact between Bombay mills and Lancashire machines also \nenabled a quick and successful diversification into weaving in response to this problem. As I \nmentioned above, import substitution in machinery, parts, and manpower occurred too. The \n\u2018Indianization\u2019 of the cotton mill supervisory staff in the interwar period represents a successful \nand somewhat under-researched case of capability building.18 Such cases were not numerous. A \nrecent survey of technological choices in private manufacturing attributes conservative decisions \nand the restrained manner in which capability building occurred to risk aversion, rather than the \nactions of the state.19\nIf we consider these examples collectively, globalization would seem to have had a \nmixed and differentiated effect on Indian industrial capability. Commodity and technology flows \n6 \n \nweakened some traditional occupations, foreclosed some potentially beneficial choices, and \nstrengthened other spheres of operation by stimulating learning and expanding choices. The \npresent paper is an attempt to read the history of the iron industry in colonial India in order to \ndevelop a broader understanding of why the impact of globalization was necessarily variegated. \nThe textile example hints at a reason why it was. Handloom weavers, protected by market \nsegmentation, gained from globalization because new knowledge augmented an already rich \nresource, their craft skills. In the case of cotton mills, the cost of cotton was unassailably low in \nIndia, costs of machinery were brought down via integration of Indian port cities with the British \neconomy especially after the Suez Canal opened, and costs of capital were kept manageable by \ninstitutional means adopted by merchant communities. New knowledge could attain success \nhere. In short, the nature of the impact varied according to costs and availability of other factors \nof production. Iron illustrates this very point. \n \nArtisanal smelting \nIn the prelude to the Industrial Revolution, iron-making developed in contact with the \nprincipal user industries. In early modern England and Wales, clusters of bloomery located near \nsources of fuel and ore served water-powered forge shops in the neighbourhood. They supplied \nagricultural tools, construction material, consumer articles, and machine parts. Eventually, ore \nwas imported from overseas. In India, in contrast, iron-making retained its links with the mining \nof ore, and concentrated in regions that had supplies of iron ore and charcoal occurring together. \nBut these regions did not usually have large and diversified hardware industries, or a \nconcentration of diverse users.20 This close contact between occurrence of ore and smelting \nimposed certain characteristics upon the conduct of the industry. \n7 \n \nFirst, the average furnaces in early nineteenth century India were small in capacity \nrelative to those in early modern England and parts of western Europe. The actual furnace size \nvaried between regions within India, but even the largest did not reach 100 tons. In the 1630s, an \naverage furnace in the Midlands made 350-400 tons of finished iron annually.21 The largest \nfurnaces in India were located in Malabar, and were, if operated at full capacity, capable of 90 \ntons of sponge iron.22 In 1838, an average furnace of permanent construction in western India \nmanufactured about 16 tons of wrought iron each. Some of the permanent furnaces in Birbhum \nin eastern India were capable of producing 34 tons of sponge iron, or 24 tons of bar iron.23 The \ncapacity of the semi-permanent furnaces commonly set up in central, eastern, and northern India \nwas smaller, and rarely exceeded 2 tons of wrought iron a year, given the extremely small output \nper charge.24 One authority observes that a permanent furnace in Birbhum that employed 100 \npersons might produce half a ton of bar iron per person.25 The actual average should be higher, \nfor many of these workers were employed part-time. Elsewhere, I have assumed an average \noutput per person of 4 tons of wrought iron a year, to estimate possible production levels in the \nearly nineteenth century.26 The number is a plausible one.27 The true average cannot be precisely \nestimated because the relationship between labour-intensity and furnace size is unclear. It cannot \nbe substantially higher, however, for in the mid-nineteenth century, by far the more common \ntype was the semi-permanent furnace. \nSecond, evidence of long-distance maritime trade in iron goods remains scarce. The few \nreferences available in the early modern period yield a low figure for export, not exceeding a few \ntons.28 Equally scarce are references to an extensive inland trade in ores. Charcoal, being brittle, \nis not a good material for long distance trade. There is mention of a trade in ores and bar iron in \nBirbhum, but it was conducted by small-scale itinerant operators confined in a small region.29 \n8 \n \nThe infrequent occurrence of trade can be explained with reference to the enormous cost of \ncarriage that would have to be paid for any ore taken from the main source regions. An 1830s \narticle urging European capitalists to settle in the out-of-the-way Khasi hills and make iron using \nlocal resources, mentioned that transportation accounted for two-third of the final price of iron \nore sold only a short distance away.30 Third, possibly because a large market for ore could not be \nfound, mining of ore occurred on a small scale, on the surface, and frequently by the smelters. \nAll of these would point to the close contact that smelting maintained with ore regions. In turn, \nthe smelters supplied a market located within close proximity, usually for agricultural tools. The \nsmelter-cum-smith recruited workers from a few families, and did not target markets that could \noffer economies of scale, such as, construction, shipping, and machinery. Fourth, there is a \nsurprising lack of evidence suggesting inter-regional exchange in technological knowledge. The \nmajor centres of the industry appear to have been self-contained knowledge worlds, with the \nresult that a large dispersion in furnace type and size persisted until the last quarter of the \nnineteenth century, when all the segments of indigenous iron-making were in decline. \nThe exception to this pattern was crucible steel connected with weaponry, which was an \nurban industry that served an urban clientele. This industry mainly used wrought iron to make \nsteel, and did not usually make iron from ore. Similarly, sword polishers used recycled old \nmaterial. Both groups depended on traded material and served relatively rich buyers. By the most \ngenerous estimate, the net demand for crucible steel due to weaponry could not exceed a few \nhundred tons a year.31 Although specialized, it was this article that commanded the greatest \ncuriosity among European observers in the late eighteenth century.32\nSnapshots of the domestic artisanal manufacture of iron in the nineteenth century suggest a \npredominance of semi-nomadic itinerant communities who performed smelting in the ore \n9 \n \nregions. Figure 1 illustrates the typical modes of working. Groups such as these tended to be \nitinerant for two reasons, charcoal had to be procured from a wide area. And being sometimes \nblacksmiths themselves, their market was dispersed over many villages. An interesting \ndescription of \u2018the Taremook, or wandering blacksmith\u2019, of unspecified provenance within the \nDeccan, occurs in a mid-nineteenth century report on communities that were usually migratory. \nThey travelled in groups of families, settled on the outskirts of a large village for a few months, \nperformed smelting and iron-work, and were not known to own land.33 Descriptions in the \nsecond half of the nineteenth century suggest a somewhat more sedentary character of the \nindustry. The people who called themselves Agaria in central India, Aguriah in eastern India, and \nthe Lohars of western, central and northern India were ordinarily engaged in iron. Some \nmembers of these communities worked as smelters as well as smiths.34 Elsewhere, they were \nintegrated in the peasant village.35 The village Lohar was paid by an allowance of grain. Many \nLohars also cultivated land. By and large these village smelters-cum-smiths fashioned their own \ntools of the trade.36 In some cases, mining was done by a distinct group of people. However, \nthere is evidence also of the smelters mining iron themselves, especially among the Agarias. In \nnineteenth century ethnographic material, we also come across rural smelting communities that \nclaimed to have descended from a tradition of sword-making.37 But such instances were rare. \n \n \n10 \n \n Figure 2. \u2018Iron-smelters of Palamau\u2019 \nSource: Valentine Ball, Jungle Life in India, 1880, reproduced in Verrier Elwin, The Agaria, \nOxford, 1942. \n \nThe world of indigenous artisanal smelting declined after the entry of Swedish and British \niron in India in the nineteenth century. The decline, however, was a protracted one. Until the \nrailway network became sufficiently dense, engineers in the army and in the civil departments \nsometimes procured locally made iron to \u2018work up into tools, straps, bolts, &c.\u2019.38 As the \nrailways spread into the interior, the practice stopped. Beginning with heavier goods such as \ncomplete iron roofs and bridges, and pig iron, imports diversified into goods that competed with \ndomestic products directly.  \nIn the middle of the nineteenth century, iron blooms used by the north Indian Lohar came \nfrom the Central Provinces. In 1908, imported bar iron had completely replaced the local raw \nmaterial. Local iron-making, such as the early nineteenth century enterprises observed by \nThomas Oldham, maintained only \u2018a precarious existence\u2019 in the hills and had disappeared from \nthe plains.39 The country smelter \u2018usually has his fields and only devotes a fraction of his time to \n11 \n \nhis craft.\u201940 The soft iron used by the Kanpur Lohars was called suli, \u2018the word is thought by \nsome people to be a corruption of Swedish\u2019. In the mid-nineteenth century, there were 160 \nfurnaces in the Bhandara region of central India. There were scarcely any left in 1908.41 In iron \nareas that were located far away from the railway line, a few furnaces continued to function, \nsometimes sponsored by the zamindars in whose territory the mines occurred and who were the \nmain buyers of the goods. The relationship between the zamindars and the smelters was not a \nhappy one, however. The more opportunities there were for trade, the keener was the zamindar to \nsqueeze the smelter. Falling custom pushed the earnings of the semi-nomadic iron-makers of \nGond and Agaria origin to very low levels. When fully employed, they hoped to earn an income \nthat was lower than the average wage of the agricultural labourer.42 The relatively larger-scale \nworkshops of Southern India and those of Birbhum suffered an earlier and quicker decline, \nalmost certainly due to scarcity of wood fuel.  \nThe obvious reason for decline was that the cost of Indian iron had been too high. About \n1900, the average price of country iron per ton (based on six samples from Santal Parganas, \nBundelkhand, Bhandara, Chhattisgarh, Garhwal, and Konkan) was Rs. 187. And the average of \ntwo samples of iron of English manufacture Rs. 131.43 The price difference between domestic \nand imported iron had been wide in the eighteenth century as well.44 In these times, the \ndifference could not reflect relative levels of mechanization. Both knowledge worlds relied \nfundamentally on manual labour, charcoal, and bloomery type furnace. And yet, mainly due to \ndifferences in scale, labour productivity was low, and the cost of conversion of ore into finished \niron, as well as energy-intensity, were high in India. An exact measure of relative labour \nproductivity cannot be constructed, not least because many Indian smelters were part-time \nworkers. I have discussed above the very small capacity of the average furnace. Nineteenth \n12 \n \ncentury observers familiar with European practice noted \u2018the immense disproportion between the \ntime and labour expended and the out-turn\u2019 of iron in such small furnaces in India.45 In \nseventeenth century England, the average quantity of charcoal used was 2.5 loads per ton of pig \niron.46 Taking a load to measure approximately 15 cwt of charcoal, we get a charcoal-iron ratio \nof 1.9:1. In the mid-nineteenth century, the most efficient artisanal iron-making in Europe, the \nSwedish forge, turned out a ratio of 1.3:1, and the least efficient, the Catalan forge, 7:1.47 \nTraditional smelting in Bundelkhand, based on a description of a mid-nineteenth century source, \nused a charcoal-iron ratio of approximately 8:1.48 In the forests of Chota Nagpur, the ratio was \nabout 5.3:1.49 In Bhandara region of central India, the ratio was 6.3:1.50 Likewise, the standard \nore-bar conversion ratio of 8-10:1 compared poorly with European averages.51\nIn addition to higher conversion cost to begin with, the Indian smelter had to contend, \nlike charcoal-iron makers elsewhere, with rising cost of fuel.52 Where forests had once been \nplentiful, they were either beginning to become scarce or protected. When British rule began in \nthe Kumaon Himalayas, iron mines were in existence in the Ramgarh region. Bishop Heber was \ninformed in 1824 that a good deal of iron ore was found in the neighbourhood of Almorah, \n\u2018which the inhabitants of the small village were employed in washing from its grosser impurities, \nand fitting it to be transported to Almorah for smelting.\u201953 In the 1820s, the headman of a \ncommunity called Agaris had taken a lease to work all the mines in the region. It appears that \nmost of these works were abandoned, and the Agaris left the region when easily transportable \ncharcoal ran out of supply. From the 1860s, the central Indian Lohar had to pay a large fee to the \nForest Department. Oldham estimated that 40 furnaces in the Nimar district drew their fuel \nsupplies from 350 square miles of forest. The number is possibly an overestimate, for elsewhere, \nwe find a figure of 30 acres for one furnace. Still, the enormity of the charcoal constraint can be \n13 \n \ngauged from these numbers. Not surprisingly, \u2018the lohars complain that charcoal grows dearer \nand dearer.\u201954\nMuch before the decline of indigenous smelting became pronounced, another form of \nartisanal iron-making was trying to establish itself in India. In the nineteenth century, artisan-\nentrepreneurs having some connection with the East India Company tried to erect viable iron \nshops after the English model. They were driven by a conception of comparative advantage that \nwas not totally unrealistic. In this view, \u2018they have labour cheap, and they have abundance of ore \ncheap, but they want skill and capital.\u201955 These entrepreneurs expected that with a change in \nscale they could bring down average costs substantially. \nDespite the mention of \u2018capital\u2019 in this citation, these individuals were far from capitalists. \nThey were artisans brought up in the British tradition. In this respect, they fit the flow of migrant \nartisans and labourer from Britain to India better than the foreign investment that went into tea, \njute, and indigo, in the same time. Migration of European artisans to India had begun in the \neighteenth century.56 Thousands more travelled to India to make a career after the end of the \nCompany\u2019s charter in 1813. A substantial number was absorbed in the army, the railways, and \nthe government, but many others joined jobs that demanded skills then unavailable in India, as \nteachers, lawyers, and artisans. Unfortunately, the precise scale and composition of European \nmigration cannot be measured with certainty. At 1860, the three Presidency towns together had a \npopulation of about 15,000 European males of working age, not including Europeans in the \narmy. Only a handful would count as administrative workers, the majority worked in industry \nand services.57 Among those employed in the army and the railways were numerous engineers. \nThe settlers themselves gave rise to a market for \u2018carriages, furniture of all kinds, \npalankeens of a peculiar construction, invented by the Europeans, plate, sadlery, boots and shoes, \n14 \n \nsalting meats, in making guns and pistols, and a variety of other articles\u2019, which included watch-\nmaking, silverware, and glassware. In the eighteenth century, this demand had stimulated the \ntrade in manufactured goods imported from Britain.58 \u2018A great number of European artisans .. \nestablished themselves in Calcutta, in Patna, at all our cantonments at Lucknow\u2019 to produce these \ngoods. Tanneries, glass-works, casting and forging shops and carpentry workshops were \nestablished in large numbers. In Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay could be found \u2018British artisans \nand manufacturers of almost every description of trade that is exercised in [Britain]: such as \ncoachmakers, carpenters, cabinetmakers, upholsterers, workers in the different metals, workers \nin all kinds of tanned leather, tailors, and shoemakers\u2019.59 These members of a European \nunderclass were far removed from the governing elite, and routinely married Indian women. In \nturn, \u2018many of the half-cast, or children of European fathers and native mothers are employed in \nsuch trades\u2019.60 In Calcutta, a \u2018very large shipbuilder\u2019 in the 1820s, Kid or Kyd, was of \u2018half-\ncaste\u2019 origin.61\nSome of these adventurers, including Andrew Duncan and Josiah Marshall Heath, had \nbeen iron-masters. \nA Scottish iron-master, Andrew Duncan worked for more than 15 years in Scotland and \nRussia, before arriving in Bengal in 1810.62 He was engaged by the Company to carry out a \nsurvey and prepare a report on the prospects of finding iron in Midnapore and Balasore, and \nconstruct a smelting shop and a foundry, on the promise of a sale contract with the Government. \nHis survey took him to Birbhum, where a considerable iron industry then existed, and where he \nset up an experimental smelting shop. When the landlords discovered that Duncan was not a \ngovernment employee, they \u2018left nothing within their power undone to thwart and defeat my \n15 \n \npurposes\u2019. His workers were bribed or coerced away, and his buildings destroyed. Despite such \ntroubles, he managed to produce some iron in the next seven months. \nThe Birbhum experiment taught Duncan that the main obstacle to setting up a large-scale \nworkshop was workers. Duncan found it impossible to secure workers willing to learn how to \noperate the machines that he had brought with himself. The problem inclined him towards a \nlocation where European foremen would be more easily available, though Duncan still \ncontemplated employing and training a mainly Indian work-force. Further, he appeared to have \ndropped the idea of a smelting shop. He was authorised on government expense to erect a \nfoundry on the confluence of the Mayurakshi and Hughly rivers in 1812. In 1814, when the \nbuilding was completed, Fort William had second thoughts and appointed a committee of \nengineers to assess the project. The committee\u2019s report stated that Duncan was a good ironmaster \nbut a bad accountant, and had underestimated the cost of transporting ore to this spot, Bigpore, \nand overestimated the cost of importing unwrought and cast iron. Nevertheless, Duncan was \nasked to start manufacturing. The subsequent history of the enterprise is not clear. The factory \npossibly manufactured a few shells. But there is no mention of a substantial body of workers \nbeing employed here. One of the last pieces of official correspondence on this enterprise sought \ninstructions from Fort William concerning the bullocks procured to transport material. The \npromise of a historic career having ended, the bullocks spent their last days at the Commissariat \nslaughterhouse. \nThe best documented modern venture in smelting was the Porto Novo factory.63 Porto Novo \n(Parangipettai) was a one-time port used by Dutch, French and English ships, and a small town \nlocated on the north bank of the Vellar river where the river meets the Bay of Bengal. Here, in \n1825, Josiah Marshall Heath, a Company servant, sought permission to set up an iron-making \n16 \n \nfactory \u2018embracing the process of smelting, puddling, and beating out into bars\u2019.64 Heath\u2019s \ndemand was an exclusive lease of ores occurring in the region for the legally maximum time for \nsuch lease, 21 years. The grant of an exclusive license drew a threatening response from George \nJessop, who had successfully established with his brother a foundry in Calcutta (that lives on \ntoday as a state enterprise).65 On the other hand, Heath received the backing of Thomas Munro, \nand along with him, a powerful section of Madras administration. \nThe factory would produce 4000 tons of bar iron, at a cost of \u00a312 per ton. The price of \nEnglish pig iron was \u00a38.3 per ton at this time. In Heath\u2019s license application, the price of bar iron \nwas set at \u00a334-40 per ton in England and \u00a318-24 in India, both figures appear exaggerated. In \nboth markets, Heath managed to convince the concerned Company officers, his enterprise would \nmake profit. The enterprise was troubled from the start. Heath soon found himself in debt to the \nCalcutta agency house, Alexander and Co., to the extent of Rs. 100,000 for the property \npurchased in Porto Novo and needed a large loan from the Company to proceed. The Porto Novo \nIron Works also raised capital in Madras, by persuading Company surgeons and the Advocate-\nGeneral in charge of drawing up the contract, to become shareholders. It does not appear that it \nmanaged to pay either dividend or interest at any time. By 1840, the company was hopelessly in \ndebt. \nAs late as 1849, a memorandum by the Accountant General stated that \u2018the causes of the \ntotal failure of the undertaking are at present inexplicable\u2019.66 While the iron was high priced, \nlack of demand was not the reason for failure. Although the first batches of pig iron supplied \nfrom Porto Novo to England failed to pass the test of quality, the problem was eventually sorted \nout. In 1859 About 1850, Sheffield imported a small quantity of Indian pig iron. In an estimated \nannual consumption of 35,000-40,000 tons, Indian production, almost all of it from Porto Novo, \n17 \n \nsupplied a quantity slightly less than 1000 tons, a small proportion, but large enough in volume \nto draw attention. In this market, Porto Novo iron was known for superior quality. Heath\u2019s own \nstatement after he returned to England in 1837 complained about the lack of cooperation in \nSheffield; about the fact that his goods did not find market in India, and that the Government \nrefused to respond to his call for marketing contract.67 In Sheffield, however, a different \nperception prevailed. Heath\u2019s problem was not demand, not quality, nor the price, but inelastic \nscale. Sheffield, in fact, wanted more of Heath\u2019s iron, considered unequal for steel tools, but \nHeath \u2018indignantly rejected\u2019 the offer of a contract to supply a larger and steady volume. \u2018The \nfact was, he knew he could not do it.\u201968 The problem was on the supply side. \nIn current scholarship, the explanation of why Porto Novo failed remains conjectural, and \ntherefore, not always persuasive. One work suggests that the enterprise suffered from capital \nshortage.69 The interpretation would be convincing, but for the fact that the company was in debt \nto the tune of nearly a million rupees when it ended. The very prospect of dragging on for twenty \nyears with other peoples\u2019 money discounts capital shortage as the critical factor in its demise. In \nthis time, venture capital could be raised, even though the negotiation costs were sometimes \nquite high, by taking recourse to London, the Company, or Calcutta agency houses. An earlier \nstudy surveyed a few other examples of failed European adaptation of indigenous smelting \nprocesses, and attributed the failure to incompatibility between indigenous work organization \nand the scale of the new enterprise.70 It is true that the two knowledge orders were too far apart \nand too incompatible to develop working partnerships. However, what we want to know is how \nthis factor made a difference to actual operation of a factory such as Porto Novo. I would argue \nthat the main supply problems in this case were posed by the costs of labour and materials. The \n18 \n \nreason the government did not support the enterprise as much as Heath had hoped for was the \npersistent failure to reduce these costs. \nA report conducted in 1833 stressed the importance of \u2018steady intelligent workmen\u2019 and \nsteady supply of charcoal to make the enterprise a success.71 Another report in 1837 was more \ncandid, \u2018the persons in immediate charge of the machinery at Porto Novo appear to have been \nnot educated men, but merely working artificers.\u2019 \u2018The fundamental defect of there being no \ncompetent engineer\u2019 contributed to the delayed commissioning of the works. The machines \nordered from England were incomplete, operating bellows with cattle power proved ill-\nconceived, buildings were of insufficient dimension, the European workmen arrived a year after \nthe machinery did, and \u2018adequate arrangement had not been made for the provision of fuel.\u201972 \nThere is no evidence that Porto Novo ever employed Indian workers above the most unskilled \ntasks. Why did it not employ Indians in supervisory positions? The answer is obvious. Given the \ncharacter of indigenous smelting in the interior regions, it would be difficult for the owner of a \n4000 tons furnace to contemplate making use of smelters practiced to operate two-ton makeshift \nfurnaces. \nTransportation of wood fuel was a huge problem in this region that still did not have either \ngood roads or railways. The ores would have to be transported from Salem by rivers and canals, \nwhich were navigable for about six months in the year. A small canal used by the factory to \ntransport charcoal dried up.73 In a further blow to the prospects of the works, the workshop did \nnot have, and despite tortuous negotiations over a decade, failed to establish, undisputed property \nrights over resources. The Board of Revenue asserted the rights of the people to the common \nforest lands in the region, including the right to collect wood and ore.74 The Collector of Salem \nstated that \u2018the hundreds of native furnaces at work\u2019 in his jurisdiction were already able to \n19 \n \nprovide \u2018any quantity of iron required by the people\u2019; that \u2018very many make their livelihood by \nburning charcoal and bringing it for sale to the iron smiths\u2019, and it was his duty to protect these \nlivelihoods.75 India after all was not a New World colony where the settlers could write their \nown laws. On the contrary, natural resources such as wood, water, and iron were entangled in \ncomplicated customary rights, which some officers of the government felt it their duty to protect. \nA yet third contemporary venture on which some information is available is the Kumaon Iron \nWorks, which was formally launched in 1856. It had been officially known for at least thirty \nyears before this date that Kumaon had indigenous smelting, ore, and plenty of wood fuel. In \n1856, the Government considered production of charcoal iron with the help of private capital. It \nappears that two small smelting workshops under government supervision had already been \nworking in this area. Two private agents, Davis and Co. and one Drummond, took over these two \nworkshops. These two firms merged in 1862 to form North of India Kumaon Iron Works \nCompany (Limited). The enterprise had its eyes on potential demand for iron from the railways. \nBut it faced an insurmountable obstacle transporting and accessing wood. Proposal for a light \nrailway to connect the ore region with the nearest major railhead did not materialize until 1864, \nwhen the factory was abandoned. Kumaon was rapidly emerging as a major potential source of \ntimber. In the two years of its existence, an elaborate licensing contract was drawn between the \ncompany and the Government, which added stringent and in some views impractical clauses on \nregeneration of forests. The opportunity cost of charcoal, therefore, killed the idea. In 1876, the \nGovernment again tried to attract private capital, to no success.76\nHistorians of iron industry have paid particular attention to a series of experiments conducted \nin Birbhum.77 In this region, between 1770 and 1870, licenses to mine and\/or produce iron in \nlarge furnaces were procured, more or less in that order, by one Indranarayan Sharma, Messrs \n20 \n \nMott and Farquhar, several neo-zamindars of whom Baishnabcharan Hajra was the most \nprominent name, and the Birbhum Iron Works Company set up by Messrs Mackay and Company \nof Calcutta. The identity of some of these individuals remains obscure. The first of these \nventures never began; the second fought exhausting battles with the principal zamindari in \nBirbhum over rent and with the local smelters over access to material before giving up; Hajra \nwas engaged in a protracted lawsuit with one Madangopal Basu, who had purchased a piece of \nthe now splintered Birbhum raj; and the fourth declined due to competition of cheaper imported \niron and increasing cost of transporting wood fuel as forests receded rapidly from the second \nquarter of the nineteenth century. The correspondence of the Mackay and Company contains the \nhint that the owners had spent an enormous amount of money hiring workers who, they felt, were \ndangerously prone to drunkenness. In response to this problem, the company lobbied to ban \nproduction of spirit in the neighbourhood of the works.78\nThe examples establish that European enterprise in India failed because of a persistent \nunderestimation of input costs, both measureable direct costs and transaction costs. It faced high \nenergy cost, for wood fuel was costly to transport in regions that did not have many navigable \nrivers. The European work-force often proved unreliable and inexperienced. Property rights and \nrights to the commons were not to the advantage of a factory. And given that these works failed \nto make a convincing attempt to address these problems, the government was only a half-hearted \npartner in these ventures. Finally, there was a misperception of demand. These enterprises \nunderstood the colonial market consisting of the army, public construction, and the railways, and \nthought a promise to supply these markets would enable them to get concessionary licenses on \nore, wood, and market. The colonial market was an unreliable partner, however. Porto Novo \n21 \n \nmade an attempt to sell an iron plough to peasants, but too late and too hesitantly to make any \ndifference to its profitability.79\nAs we move on to the end of the nineteenth century, Indo-European enterprise in iron had \nbegun locating themselves in easy proximity of railway lines that served mining tracts. And they \nhad switched to the reverberatory furnace and coking coal, though some of the early enterprises \nin coke-furnaces continued to be troubled by the quality of coal.80 The Tatas issues their \nprospectus in 1907, having once before abandoned a plan to set up a mill in Chanda. These new \nproposals contemplated not only much larger scale of operation, but also integration of \nmanufactures, coal washery, labour barracks, township building, and mining, a technological \nmodel that had better prospect of succeeding, provided enough capital and marketing support \nwere available. \n  If the smelting story shows why import substitution was so difficult, the blacksmith story \nshows how knowledge transactions could facilitate import substitution. \n \nBlacksmiths \nThe first inkling we have that the blacksmith story may be quite a different one comes \nfrom wages data. Between 1870 and 1930, the average earnings of skilled urban artisans \nincluding blacksmiths increased about three and a half times, stayed above the average earnings \nof mill workers, were consistently higher than the wages of rural labourers, and the gap was \nincreasing.81 It was not the case that business failures were rare among the skilled urban \nblacksmith, but cases of lost markets were more than matched by new opportunities. There was \nalso more differentiation within the blacksmith community, one end of it being engaged in \nmeeting rural demand and another supplying urban demand. Figure 2 shows the interior of an \n22 \n \nurban workshop. The latter group especially came in systematic contact with European \nconsumption and imported tools and techniques. \n \n \nFigure 2. Blacksmith workshop in a north Indian town, 1825 \nSource: James Skinner, Tashrih al-Aqvam, from British Library images collection. \n \nIn this section, I explore one specific ingredient in the improvement in productivity in \nthis sphere, Indo-European collaboration and knowledge spillover. The five major channels of \nknowledge transfer in which I classify the available evidence are, following a roughly \nchronological order: early modern coastal trade; European firms in early nineteenth century \ncolonial port cities; military engineers located in the interior of the country; Indian blacksmiths \nmanufacturing small consumption articles for the city market; and technical schools and \ngovernment factories at the turn of the nineteenth century. \nThe history of technological transaction in iron goods goes back to the beginning of \nsettlement of European traders on the Indian coast. A description of Indian ship-building on the \n23 \n \nwestern coast in the eighteenth century remarked that \u2018their anchors are mostly European, our \niron being much better, and better worked.\u201982 There is considerable evidence that, even though \ncasting was not a well-developed indigenous industry, a great deal of ship anchors were being \ncast in ports using indigenous iron and ironsmiths working under European direction and custom. \nIn the seventeenth century, the Dutch East India Company set up iron works near Palakole on the \nsouthwestern coast.83 The works possibly contained a foundry, employed Indian blacksmiths, \nand represented a different technological paradigm in shipping, one that employed a great deal \nmore iron than did the Indian ships. Thomas Bowrey, the English merchant who lived in Bengal \nin the 1670s, observed that the works employed \u2018Several black Smiths, makeinge all Sorts of \niron worke, (necessarie for Ships) whereby they doe Supply most of theire fleets with Such \nNecessaries\u2019. The \u2018necessaries\u2019 included \u2018speeks\u2019, bolts, and anchors. Apart from iron parts, the \ncluster also produced rope and twine for the riggings, and had master ship-builders, \u2018who have \nmost of their dependencies Upon the English, and indeed learnt their art and trade from some of \nthem, by diligently Observinge the ingenuitie of Some that build Ships and Sloops here for the \nEnglish East India Company and theire Agents..\u2019.84 Bowrey complained of their \n\u2018falseheartedness\u2019, at having learnt from the English and yet working for the Dutch. Read in a \nmore positive light, the description hinted at an active labour market for skills. A slightly later \nsource mentioned casting of anchors for ships, though \u2018not so good as those made in Europe\u2019.85 \nThese works were located near Balasore, where the English and the Dutch had trading stations \nbefore moving up north. One authority on iron considers that the presence of many larger-scale \niron smelting workshops in Kathiawad, and near Masulipatnam, were a legacy of the European \nenterprise connected with ship-building.86\n24 \n \nAfter the Company received the dewanny of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa, cannons became a \nmajor item of import into India. Attempts to substitute imports were sponsored by the importers \nthemselves. A cannon foundry was proposed in 1768 to be erected inside the Fort William, a \nshort time after slightly worried Company officers saw a similar enterprise run by the Nawab of \nAwadh. Ten years later, a whole blast furnace was contracted, but not delivered, for the use of \nthe Fort William foundry.87 In the eighteenth century again, Indian princes who had come in \nclose contact with British enterprise and society, the Nawabs of Carnatic and Awadh for \nexample, purchased a great deal of high-bulk prefabricated European iron goods, and sometimes \nhad them made locally. Founding cannons with European help was a popular preoccupation of \nthe regional princes in this time. The Chief Engineer of Fort William, a Col. Polier, who was also \nan inspiration to James Rennell on cartography, took up employment with the Awadh state.88 \nThe Carmelite priest Paolino da San Bartolomeo wrote that in the 1770s \u2018the king of Travancor \npurchases Every year, from the Europeans, iron, cannon, and cloth for the use of his soldiers\u2019.89 \nSan Bartolomeo also wrote that there was a garrison of European soldiers in the same place \nwhere the arsenal of the Travancore king was located, and made a special note of the \u2018cannon \nfoundery\u2019 that the garrison contained.90\nCannons were not the only end-use of a foundry. In the eighteenth century in Calcutta, \nthe afore-mentioned Kyd\u2019s docks on Hooghly produced boats that were familiar on the \nsoutheastern coast in the early nineteenth century, and further south, a point of anchorage called \nGloucester, later Gloster, possessed a ship-building yard that later converted into a cotton factory \nand a distillery.91 It can be presumed that both these works contained foundries. James Kyd was \nan illegitimate son of Robert Kyd (1746-93), engineer in the army, and the founder of the \nbotanical gardens of Calcutta. According to one myth, James was the origin of the name \n25 \n \nKidderpore, where his docks were located. The same site had an even older dockyard belonging \nto Henry Watson, who became bankrupt. On the opposite shore, in a mud fort a cannon foundry \nwas reportedly in existence in the eighteenth century.92\nThe nineteenth century began with a rapid increase in the import of iron goods into India. \nThe evidence of Charles Atkinson, the Mayor of Sheffield, and Robert Jackson, Master Cutler, \nrecorded before a Parliamentary Committee in 1859 contains general information of the early \nnineteenth century English exports to India.93 With the end of the East India Company monopoly \ntrading rights, the scale of business between India and Sheffield grew rapidly. The main articles \nof export were \u2018cutlery, tools of all kinds, more particularly tools for joiners\u2019 and carpenters\u2019 \npurposes, files and saws, steel, and latterly steel springs for railway purposes .. and hardware \ngenerally.\u2019 \nInterestingly, other than cutlery, many of the products mentioned in this list were tools of \ntrade for the carpenter and the blacksmith. Blacksmiths were sufficiently common among the \nEuropean population of Calcutta, and more rarely, north India. One of them came in accidental \ncontact with Bishop Heber of Calcutta, on his travels near Allahabad in 1824.94 The generic \ncarriage workshops of Calcutta saw a joining of European enterprise with Indian skilled labour, \nboth carpenters and blacksmiths. Cutlery had been imported into India in the early-1800s, and \nyet, a change was visible. \u2018I have seen articles of cutlery and even brass instruments made in \nvery considerable perfection; the latter was at the gun carriage yard, in Seringapatam, where \nEuropean superintendents have instructed some of the half-cast artisans and natives to be very \nskilful workmen\u2019.95 The gun-carriage workshop in Madras that provided material for bridges and \nmilitary purposes was \u2018simply a big workshop where all the common tools used by smiths are \nemployed\u2019, and there were several other such workshops in Madras in 1840.96 Indian workmen \n26 \n \nworked in considerable numbers in the arsenals, as we have seen, and the Mint at Calcutta, \nwhere their skill in cutting the dies, turning lathe, and rolling copper into sheets \u2018with equal \nfacility as if performed by the best European workmen\u2019 impressed David Smith, the Government \nIron and Coal Viewer, in 1856. Smith also felt that without a change of food and dress, the \nweakly built \u2018Bengalee\u2019 would not be able to stand the heat and the hard work of the puddling or \nthe rolling mills of average scale then usual in Britain.97\nA travelogue published in 1837 contains a detailed description of Monghyr in Bihar, the \nerstwhile capital of Bengal, where a large number of manufactories produced a great variety of \ndurable goods. The concept of many of these goods had come from Europe, but the \nmanufacturing process and the skills derived from indigenous workmanship.98 Some of these \ngoods met new consumption and were manufactured \u2018under the inspection of persons well \nancquanited with these arts\u2019. The most famous branch of such hybrid enterprise consisted of \narms.Foremost among \u2018the vast number of new articles\u2019 found in Monghyr in the 1830s were \ndouble-barelled guns and rifles. The \u2018blacksmiths, who work up steel and iron into a great \nvariety of forms\u2019 hailed from an indigenous tradition already making \u2018the best kind .. of spears\u2019. \nBut their workmanship was easily adaptable, and they promised to be \u2018easily trained .. in any \nmechanical employment.\u2019 This source on Monghyr expressly mentioned the absence of \nEuropean owned workshop in the town, even though the buyers of these goods, who included \nmany Europeans, sometimes ntervened in the design of the goods. This pattern did not change \nradically in the ninteenth century. Blacksmiths continued to be predominantly Indians. But a few \nsignificant exceptions can be found. \nA somewhat well-recorded Indo-European enterprise was the firm of James Petrie, a \ncotton ginner in Coimbatore. His experience points at a few general features of skill transfer in \n27 \n \nmachine-using industries.99 Manufacturing had become more complex and more mechanized \nbetween 1814 and 1847, and by the latter date, some manufacturers needed to hire local hands to \nfabricate and repair machinery. Usually, carpenters and blacksmiths performed such tasks. \nLearning did not pose any obstacle. \u2018In a very short time, almost an incredibly short time, they \nlearnt to make up the machines which I required.\u2019 But learning also occurred on the blacksmiths\u2019 \nown terms. There was no wholesale substitution of English practice for Indian practice; rather, \nIndian artisans combined old and new tools, traditional and new modes of working. Indian \ncarpenters typically worked with few metal tools, a chisel, a plane, and an axe at the most, all of \nwhich they used flexibly for a variety of purposes. Blacksmiths worked individually with small \nbellows and hammers, often setting themselves up under the shade of a tree, sitting down unlike \nthe European forge-shop workers who worked standing up. \u2018These modes of working did not \nanswer my purpose\u2019. Petrie imported large bellows, anvils, vices, and turning lathes from the \nordnance factory at Madras. When set to work \u2018in European fashion\u2019, the blacksmiths surprised \nhim. They rearranged the tools to be able to sit down and work them, and dispensed with the vice \nwhich the Indian blacksmith rarely used. Whenever Petrie paid visits to the work-space, they \nstood up to reassure him. After a few such occasions, Petrie did not press the issue. Either way, \nthey produced work of a sufficient quality for the owner to declare, \u2018I think they are as easily \nlearnt as a similar class of men in England would be that had never seen such work before.\u2019100  \n Military campaigns had placed contingents of soldiers in territories that did not have \ngood roads and bridges. In two examples from the second third of the nineteenth century, both \noccurring in a region rich in iron ore and yet distant from the port cities where skilled labourers \nwere available, we see an attempt by military engineers to recruit local artisans for a large scale \nconstruction work. Before Nagpur became the intersection point of the north-south and east-west \n28 \n \ntransportation routes, Jubbulpore held that position of importance. Goods and people from the \nHyderabad region traveled north via Chhindwara, Narsinghpur, and Jubbulpore en route to \nSagar. On this route, a stream that became impassable in the monsoons was forded by an iron \nsuspension bridge c. 1830 by one Colonel Pesgrave posted in this territory.101 There was no \nEuropean settlement and few foremen in Pesgrave\u2019s team. It is not known if any member of the \nteam possessed direct knowledge of either bridge-building or iron-making. Nevertheless, they \ngathered together a number of blacksmiths and smelters from the countryside. Such people were \ndrawn by word of mouth, curiosity, and a prospect of wage work. Bit by bit, the links were \nconstructed, put together, carried over the river and put in place. In Punasa jail in Nimar, again in \ncentral India, Lieutenant R.H. Keatinge installed an indigenous process of iron manufacture \nshortly before the Mutiny, with the help of jail labour. The works contained a heavy tilt hammer \nto refine the crude iron. He was about to set up a rolling mill when the Mutiny broke out and he \nwas called away.102\nReports of such Indo-European enterprises begin to become scarcer after 1857. A \ndifferent kind of relocation of skill begins to draw more attention thereafter, a shift of capital and \nenterprise away from the country blacksmith tied to the smelting communities, towards urban \nsmithy and town markets. Whereas the former world remained trapped in nearly stagnant \nconsumption, the urban world saw significant growth in the market for cutlery, industrial tools, \nrailway rolling stock, bridge-building, and arsenal. An 1830s description from Bihar observed \nthe division between the country blacksmith and the blacksmiths of Patna or Munger.103 The \nformer were blacksmiths engaged in producing agricultural implements, who \u2018usually belong to \nthe manorial establishment, and the payments for the implements of agriculture arises from a \nshare of the crop.\u2019 The latter were more specialized in iron, and manufactured a variety of goods, \n29 \n \n\u2018vessels for boiling sugar and sweetmeats, the drums called nakarah, nails, locks and chest \nhinges, and more rarely bird cages and horseshoes\u2019. Their earnings were double the average that \nobtained in the village. Imported goods and domestic production supplied that market jointly, \nwith the latter\u2019s share possibly increasing. In Bundelkhand likewise, village blacksmiths joined \nthe urban foundries and forges. They had to be retrained, for they needed to know the ways of \nhandling coal furnaces that worked on higher temperatures. They had to be trained on \u2018accuracy\u2019 \nand working to customized dimensions. These were matters of importance when the blacksmith \nsupplied machine parts rather than agricultural tools.104\nIn the Narmada valley in central India, \u2018when iron came to be imported on a large scale, \nthe wealthier Lohars found that it suited them to make use of the foreign material, which, though \nit might be more expensive, was in a more convenient form. .. They thus naturally drifted to the \nlarger towns, where the imported material was more readily obtainable and the field of custom \nwider.\u2019105 Imported bar iron was at first preferred for the convenient shape rather than the low \ncost, but increasingly also preferred for the cost. By 1900, in towns located in prosperous \nagricultural tracts (such as Hoshangabad), the urban blacksmith belonged in \u2018a substantial and \nprosperous class\u2019.106 A slightly different case of skill development through making new goods \nusing new materials occurred in the sphere of production of matchlocks in Bihar. In Monghyr in \nthe mid-Gangetic plains and in Dhampur and Nagina in the Himalayan foothills, matchlocks \nwere made with or without official sanction in the mid-nineteenth century, as we have seen. \u2018The \nability of the clever lohars is strikingly shown in their power of copying good European firearms \nof the modern type.\u2019107 This industry often employed designers, polishers, and wire-drawers to \ndecorate the barrels of the guns or other parts. \n30 \n \nA larger field of import substitution occurred in cutlery. With the coming of imported \nEnglish and Swedish iron, a new urban demand for cutlery grew rapidly. At the start of the \nnineteenth century, articles of steel in ordinary use, including cutlery, knives and scissors, \u2018are \ngenerally imported from England, being very superior to those manufactured in India\u2019.108 By \n1900, however, cutlery manufacture occurred in nearly all larger cities, or within clusters with \neasy access to transportation. Blacksmiths engaged in meeting the new demand required a higher \ndegree of skill in the shape of product differentiation than was necessary with agricultural \nimplements. It is in this sphere that master artisans could be found. \u2018This higher class of work is \ncarried out in larger shops and the workers are the employ\u00e9s of the master cutler\u2019. Skill \ncommanded a wage premium. The average monthly income of Rs. 15 at 1900 placed the cutler at \nthe top of the urban wage scale.109 Prem Chand Mistry was the owner of a workshop in \nKanchannagar, a small locality in the Burdwan district of western Bengal that had developed as a \nconcentration of the manufacture of iron tools, implements, and cutlery since at least the \nnineteenth century. A government report of 1890 mentioned Mistry\u2019s workshop for having \nsuccessfully introduced a hand-driven lathe.110 Twenty years later, in another report on Bengal \nmanufactures, \u2018the well-known shop\u2019 of Prem Chand Mistry finds mention again, for having \nintroduced oil-engine to drive his lathes.111 In both instances, his technological leadership was \nseen as a model for small-scale metal products industry in general. \nAt the turn of the century, the labour market opened up to admit non-family apprentices. \n\u2018In a typical shop\u2019 making cutlery in the towns of Eastern India, \u2018the following men were found \nat work: two owners, superintending, finishing and packing, etc.: two men at the forge, and a boy \nto work the bellows: one boy for filing the handles: three men for hammering and filing the \nblades: one man for joining the two portions together\u2019112 Such workshops could not follow the \n31 \n \npractice common in the villages of securing labour by means of intra-community cooperation. In \nBundelkhand towns, there was a shortage of workers, and hereditary knowledge was not \nnecessarily an advantage. Employers complained of shortage of skilled mechanics, the best being \ndrawn away to Calcutta or other larger cities. In industrial towns, therefore, smithy recruited raw \nworkers from different caste backgrounds, and a more or less formal system of apprenticeship \nwas practiced.113 In the Narmada valley again, we observe greater utilization of non-family, if \nintra-community, apprentices.114 Business organization opened up too. Larger workshops and \npartnerships were usual in the cities. It was this state of activity in the labour market that \nexplained the rise in blacksmith wages discussed earlier. \nThe cities also saw a completely new factory industry develop from the end of the \nnineteenth century, operating on European pattern with blast furnaces, foundry shops, rolling \nmills, and mechanical forges. The railway construction created an immense new demand for \nrolling stock, rails, sleepers, wires, bars, and rods. This demand encouraged private entrepreneurs \nto start iron-making using coke and rolling mills in Bengal, shortly after P.N. Bose\u2019s reports on \nthe deposits of the essential raw material in the Bengal-Bihar area became well-known. In the \nrolling mills of Calcutta, all designs and equipment were imported, and so were the foremen. The \nordnance factory of Calcutta had large metal-working shops, and recruited thousands of workers. \nPublic works and urban construction provided impetus to the factory industry. \nAn important new field of training was the railway workshops that employed both \nblacksmiths and carpenters in large numbers, often on job-work basis. In Bombay in the early \ntwentieth century, \u2018Lohars from Gujarat were preponderant among the smiths in the wheel shop\u2019, \nwhereas the foremen were all Europeans.115 The Roorkee engineering college, established in \n1848 and later renamed after James Thomason who had facilitated the new Grand Trunk Road \n32 \n \nand the Ganges canal, had a foundry, \u2018the first of the kind erected in India\u2019. The foundry was \nerected before demand for iron from the railways took off, though the resources of the college \nwere closely associated with the construction of the Ganges canal. In its origins, the foundry \ncould not have employed local workers. But by 1873, not only were the workmen all Indians, \n\u2018they will make anything for anybody, from an iron bridge or a steam engine, down to a railway \nkey; and they turn out excellent spirit levels, prismatic compasses, and so forth\u2019.116\nThe principal gun factory of British India, located in Calcutta, reported that \u2018the labour as \nrecruited is generally quite untrained\u2019. A large proportion was migrant Muslims, whereas among \nthe Bengali blacksmiths, Muslims had been conspicuously rare. The factory created its own \nsystem of training workers, and reported a large skill and wage differential between the ordinary \ntool-shop worker and the mechanic.117 Such differentials reflected the opportunity cost of the \nmechanic, who left \u2018frequently .. to find employment with private firms\u2019. In other words, a \nhierarchy between the literate class of foremen with formal training, and the raw workers, had \nformed. The situation inside the cotton textile mills of Bombay, where a hierarchy between the \nParsi or the European supervisors and the workers was in existence, was similar.118\nIn these new enterprises and organizations, the world of the formally trained Indian \nengineer, and that of the informally trained Indian blacksmith were coming into increasing \ncontact. Civil engineering was introduced as a university subject in the 1870s, and drew a \nsizeable number of Indians about 1900. The students in the university degree programmes in \nengineering numbered only a few dozen in 1900 and all hailed from \u2018the babu class\u2019; that is, the \ngentry rather than the working people. The \u2018babu\u2019 graduates usually joined the Public Works \nDepartment. These programmes had an externality. The civil engineering schools had \nmechanical shops affiliated to them, which recruited men of artisanal class as apprentice-cum-\n33 \n \nworkers. There were also, at 1900, about half a dozen provincial technical schools in Bengal \nattached to the Calcutta University. These schools offered short courses in machining. In this \nway boys of \u2018the mistry class\u2019 received formal training, and their number was growing. \n \nConclusion \nThe iron industry in nineteenth century India was transformed by the availability of \nimported goods, tools, and skills. What was the nature of the transformation? Did colonialism \nand globalization aid or obstruct industrial development? According to the received view, the \noutcome was a negative one, for imported goods destroyed indigenous industry, and the colonial \nstate distorted and obstructed wide utilization of imported tools and skills. In this paper, I argue \nthat factor costs, as distinct from political variables, explain the link between technological \nexchange and industrial development better. The outcome of globalization was not uniform, but \na mixed one, because factor costs were sometimes significantly large, and sometimes relatively \nlow. \nTo illustrate this proposition, the paper compares the experiences of smelting and smithy. \nArtisan communities producing semi-finished iron tended to be located near the ores and worked \non a scale and level of capability adapted to meeting local rural demand for iron. Production \ncosts were relatively high, but the industry was protected by high transport cost. Transport costs \nlimited trade, average scale of production, and interregional knowledge exchange. In the second \nhalf of the nineteenth century, indigenous smelting entered a crisis. The railways reduced \ntransportation costs, and brought markets within easy access of cheaper imported goods. Wood \nfuel began to become scarce, as forests were reserved, alternative demands for wood in \nconstruction, ship-building and railways grew, and in some regions, woods ran out. Given its \n34 \n \ndependence on rural markets, artisanal smelting could not possibly expand scale, economize, and \nabsorb these costs. European artisans in India tried the larger-scale and horizontally integrated \nfactory. The physical distance between their targeted market, which was the government, and the \norigin of ores again posed a transport cost problem. The one hypothetical advantage they had in \nconducting enterprises in India was cheap labour. But Indian labour was located near the ores, \nusually found working within traditional institutions such as the household, and used to operating \nsmall-scale units. There was an almost unbridgeable distance between Indian labour and \nEuropean capital. On the other hand, skilled labour imported from Britain did not necessarily \nprovide a solution. They were often unreliable and inefficient, suggesting that migration of \nwage-workers from Britain to India in this time suffered from an adverse selection problem. And \nin common with indigenous smelting, European smelting had to contend with the rising scarcity \nof wood fuel. \nIn contrast with the smelters, many of the specialist blacksmiths belonged in urban \ncommunities, were more familiar with contractual service for a diverse range of clients, closer to \nconsumer markets rather than ore supplies, and therefore less susceptible to the adverse effects of \nnarrow markets. In this sphere, globalization had a more adaptive effect. The only \ncomplementary factor necessary to make good use of imported tools and ideas was \ncraftsmanship, already available in abundance. Retraining needs were not always great and \nretraining prospects better in the towns. Much knowledge was embodied in small tools, which \nhad been partly imported, and partly substituted with refashioned local tools. There were small \neconomies of scale in smithy; consequently capital cost was of little consequence. The city, the \nports, the barracks, and the public works, allowed a convergence of knowledge to develop \nbetween European and Indian artisans. Blacksmiths benefited from the unconventional \n35 \n \ncommunication opportunities provided by these new sites, while adapting new knowledge in \ntheir own way. European money was present in this sphere, but it was not an essential factor; the \nlearning process was led by the urban Indian blacksmith. \nThe present study of iron, in contrast with previous ones, stresses some of the costs of \nstarting large-scale resource-intensive industries in mid-nineteenth century India. Could more \naggressive state intervention reduce these costs? The role of the state in the early nineteenth \ncentury was evidently minimal, among other reasons because many actors within the state \nmachine understood the barriers that private capitalists needed to overcome. A new iron factory \nin 1840 would need to build railways and canals, enter protracted negotiations on mining or land \nacquisition at a time when property rights had been redefined and allocated, wait indefinitely for \nmachines to arrive and then have them faultily assembled by inebriated poorly trained European \nforemen, and depend on European markets. In the presence of high costs of so many \ncomplementary inputs, it could not have been easy for a state to play the infant industry game. \nBy contrast, in the second half of the nineteenth century, the prospect of effective state \nintervention brightened as the costs of accessing machines, material, and manpower declined. \nIncreasingly, the only remaining barrier to the success of large-scale enterprise was cost of \ncapital. In this scenario, direct market assistance could realistically work, and it did work for the \nTatas. \nFinally, the iron example carries a lesson on the differential prospects that migrant \nartisans, the channel of knowledge transfer stressed in this paper, faced in different regions of the \nworld. The scale of settler migration to India was small compared with that of the colonies of the \nnorth Atlantic. And the scale of net migration (net of emigration from India) slowed after Crown \nrule began. As wage-gap between Britain and India widened, and New World migration became \n36 \n \na flood, newcomers to India needed to be paid a higher wage than their predecessors a century \nago could hope to get. Such expected wages restricted recruitment of technical people to a small \nsegment in the formal sector.119 But it would be a mistake to compare the two migrations only on \nscale. They differed in qualitative terms. In the north Atlantic, skills were exported as they were \nfound in points of origin. India had an established artisan tradition, and plentiful indigenous \ncommercial and industrial skills, before colonization. Settlers needed to come to terms with this \nresource. Success and failure of foreign enterprise in early-colonial India depended on how well \nor badly the grounds for such collaboration could be created. \n \n \n \n37 \n \nReferences \nPrimary sources \nInteresting Extracts from the Minutes of Evidence taken before the Committee of the Whole \nHouse, to whom it was referred to consider of the Affairs of the East India Company in the \nSessions 1813; Illustrative of the Improvements in the Manufacture of Iron, Steel, Brass, Tin, \nCopper, Hemp, Cordage, &c. by the Natives of India, London, J.M.

Colonialism in South Asia was an influential driver of \nmarket integration. \n2 The best-known statement owes to Bagchi, \u2018De-industrialisation in India\u2019, and \u2018De-industrialisation \nin Gangetic Bihar\u2019. \n3 The link between destruction of industry and world inequality figure in development and trade \nscholarship as well. One of the enduring links is the notion that manufacturing permits increasing \nreturns to scale whereas agriculture leads to diminishing returns. A second link is the idea that \nagriculture is a weak engine of growth due to Engel\u2019s law and terms-of-trade shocks. A third \nconsiders job-loss for skilled labour. See Clark, Conditions of Economic Progress; Krugman and Venables, \n\u2018Globalization and Inequality\u2019; Wood and Ridao-Cano, \u2018Skill, Trade, and International Inequality\u2019. \nFor stylized models of the historical roots of Indian poverty making use of de-industrialization, see \nDutt, \u2018Origins\u2019 and Eswaran and Kotwal, Why Poverty Persists.

The fourth segment, blacksmiths, has not been the subject of a detailed \nhistorical study yet. \n7 On the centrality of colonial political attitudes as a factor behind the delayed start of a modern iron \nand steel industry in India, see Headrick, Tentacles of Progress, pp. 295-6. On the point of loss of \nknowledge, see Parthasarathi, \u2018Iron-smelting\u2019. \n8 Some of the most important tools and processes adopted by the weavers in late-colonial India, \nsuch as the fly-shuttle sley, the frame-mounted loom, the jacquard, dobby, drop-box, and synthetic \ndyes, had been invented in Europe between the late eighteenth and the late nineteenth centuries. \nRoy, Traditional Industry, and \u2018Acceptance of Innovations\u2019, contain a statement and some illustrations. \n9 Krugman, \u2018Scale Economies\u2019. \n10 Grossman and Helpman, \u2018Trade, Innovation, and Growth\u2019. \n11 The historical literature on large-scale technological transformation also deals with motivations for \nchoice, the diffusion dynamic, and the contents of a package that get chosen. On factor costs as \nmotivation, see Ruttan and Hayami, \u2018Technology Transfer\u2019. The particular role of communication \nnetworks and urban clusters in knowledge transfer is explored in another literature, see, for example, \nNelson, \u2018Less Developed Countries\u2019, Wright, \u2018Can a Nation Learn?\u2019 \n12 Epstein, \u2018Craft Guilds\u2019, and \u2018Property Rights\u2019. Artisan migration as an adjunct to state formation \nand state decay in early modern India is studied in Haynes and Roy, \u2018Conceiving Mobility\u2019. Artisan \nmigration was important before the Industrial Revolution because machines themselves were simple \n49 \n \n                                                                                                                                             \nin construction, foreign investment was insignificant, and artisanal knowledge was embodied in the \nexperience and conventions of skilled masters. Within Western Europe, organized attempts to copy \nand steal ideas were also present in the eighteenth century, when practical knowledge became one \nfront among many along which the political and military rivalry among states was conducted, see \nHarris, Industrial Espionage. \n13 The impact of such transfer is linked with both domestic capacity to absorb, and imperfections in \nthe market for knowledge. On discussions of the relevant literature, and pessimistic as well as \noptimistic case studies, see Teece, \u2018The Market for Know-How\u2019; Mohanan Pillai and Subrahmanian, \n\u2018Rhetoric and Reality\u2019; Kojima, Direct Foreign Investment; Stiglitz, \u2018Some Lessons\u2019.

Buchanan contains descriptions of ironworks in many places in Mysore \nand Malabar, Journey. The Mysore descriptions have a repetitive quality. In the majority of the works, \na team of 10-15 workers operated smelting shops, the team sometimes included charcoal makers and \nforge operators. The net output, which consisted of agricultural tools, was shared between the \nmembers. There is frequent mention of a headman or a skilled artisan who received the largest part. \nThe person was usually the one in charge of erecting the furnace. \n23 Estimated by Thomas Oldham in 1852, reported in Gupta, Rarher Samaj, p. 263. \n24 Buchanan reported that in a larger work in Mysore, one furnace was capable of producing bar iron \nof 11 lbs. per day, or 1.6-1.9 tons per year. At a time, three furnaces were at work, which employed \n22 workers in all. The majority of these workers were part-timers, Journey, pp. 16-7. In 1906, six small \niron mines in Garhwal produced 3.5 tons of pig iron, Dobbs, Monograph, p. 11; About 1900 in \ncentral India, the output of 200-250 semi-permanent furnaces was estimated at 400 tons of refined \niron. The average annual output of a furnace did not exceed 2.4 to 3 tons of crude iron, Begbie, \nMonograph, p. 32. \n25 Gupta, Rarher Samaj, p.253. According to this work, one charge took seven days, and produced 20 \nmaunds of iron with 100 workers. \n26 Roy, \u2018Knowledge and Divergence\u2019. \n27 The number is equivalent to a team of five members erecting a makeshift furnace ten times a year. \nThese are reasonable parameters to assume for the semi-nomadic iron smelting industry. \n28 Biswas, \u2018Iron and Steel\u2019. \n51 \n \n                                                                                                                                             \n29 The maximum distance reportedly covered was about 180 miles to the north, the location of \nMonghyr town. From Monghyr, traders came to Birbhum to purchase raw material for the town\u2019s \nfamous gun-making industry, Gupta, Rarher Samaj, p. 262. An 1852 exploration of the Kharagpur \nhills south of Monghyr discovered that in this inaccessible region, \u2018a tolerable quantity of iron is \nsmelted.., generally in the jungle for the sake of being near the spot where the charcoal is burned.\u2019 \nThe smelters operate \u2018the rudest of furnaces and exchange the metal with the lowlanders for salt, \ntobacco, or rice.\u2019 Sherwill, \u2018Kurrukpore Hills\u2019. \n30 Watson, \u2018Chirra Punji\u2019. \n31 I base this proposition on plausible conjectures about the size of armies, the average weight of \nsteel carried per person, and a stock-flow ratio. \n32 Pearson, \u2018Experiments and Observations\u2019; Mushet, \u2018Experiments on Wootz\u2019; and the influential \nstudy by Stodart and Faraday, \u2018On the Alloys of Steel\u2019. \n33 Balfour, \u2018Migratory Tribes\u2019. \n34 They would take the blooms, \u2018move about from village to village with an anvil, a hammer and \ntongs, and building a small furnace under a tree, make and repair iron implements for the villagers\u2019, \nRussell and Hira Lal, Tribes and castes, p. 10. A later anthropological study of the Agarias has attained \nthe status of a classic, Elwin, The Agaria. \n35 In Bundelkhand, the smelters were also Lohars or smiths by caste. Dobbs, Monograph, p. 13. \n36 The reti, or the file, \u2018is often the only tool he has not made himself\u2019, Ibid., p. 3. \n37 At the end of the nineteenth century in Bundelkhand could be found a nomadic community of \nblacksmiths, who \u2018at certain seasons migrate from Rajputana .. wander about from place to place \nwith their families, goods, and chattels\u2019, and forged ploughshares for a fee. According to community \nlore, they had left Chittore when that city fell to the Mughals, vowing never to return until Chittore \n52 \n \n                                                                                                                                             \nwas liberated with the swords that they would themselves make and sell to the prospective \nliberators.

Bengal Iron Works, one of the \nfirst enterprises using coke, set up two small blast furnaces each with the capacity of 20 tons of pig \niron per day. The factory closed down in 1879, when its cost of production proved about 12-15 per \ncent above the market price of English cast iron goods in Calcutta. The report by von Schwarz \nidentified several design problems with the works, but more critically, the inability to handle the high \nash Bengal coal. The Nurbudda Coal and Iron Company was established with a capital of \u00a3250,000, \nin 1860, but never started operation. In 1875, a mining engineer of the name Ness, based in Warora, \ntried to experimentally smelt iron with Chanda coal. He ran up a temperature that melted the fire \nbricks, but failed to melt the iron ore. \n81 Atkinson, \u2018Statistical review\u2019; Sivasubramonian, National Income. \n82 Grose, Voyage, p. 109. \n83 Subrahmanyam, \u2018Note of Narsapur Peta\u2019. \n55 \n \n                                                                                                                                             \n84 Bowrey, Geographical Account, p. 102-5. \n85 Hamilton, \u2018A New Account\u2019, p. 392. \n86 Biswas, \u2018Iron and Steel\u2019. \n87 Fort William-India House Correspondence, Vol. V, p. 156; vol.

In factories, children under 14 are admitted only with their \nparents, yet, apart from these, there are often found very useful workmen \u201ctrained on the \npremises\u201d.\u2019 There was, nevertheless, a tension between family-based learning and non-family \napprenticeship. \u2018Outsiders sometimes learn at a disadvantage, for workmen are unwilling to teach \nthe best results of their experience except to their own sons.\u2019 Dobbs, Monograph, p. 106. \n114 Their [the Lohars\u2019] sons went to school, while also working as an apprentice in the father\u2019s forge \nor the shop of another Lohar, where they were not paid any wage and they did not pay a fee.

Ritter von Schwarz\u2019s description of a rolling mill in Bengal compares \nthe situation in England and America, where the average output of a single-rails rolling mill could go \nup to 440 tons a day, 600 tons not being unknown, with that in Bengal, where the prevailing \u2018manual \naptitude and practice\u2019 made a yield beyond 200 tons unrealistic. India Office Records, \nIOR\/V\/27\/612\/9, pp. 12-3. It is not altogether clear whether the difference resulted from quality of \ntraining or the length of the working day. \n119 Further, as Britain\u2019s own industrial lead began to slacken, India could potentially source \nknowledge and experts from other Atlantic regions, even Japan. The interwar period saw evidence \nof this diversification. \n58 \n \n"}
