The \nneap tide daily mean nitrate flux was 1.3 (0.9 \u2013 1.8, 95% confidence interval) mmol m-2 d-1. \nThe spring tide flux was initially estimated as 3.5 (2.3 \u2013 5.2, 95% confidence interval) mmol \nm-2 d-1. The higher spring tide nitrate flux was the result of turbulent dissipation occurring \nwithin the base of the SCM, compared to deeper dissipation during neap tides, and was \ndominated by short events associated with the passage of internal solitons. Taking into \naccount the likely under-sampling of these short mixing events raised the spring tide nitrate \nflux estimate to about 9 mmol m-2 d-1. The neap tide nitrate flux was sufficient to support \nsubstantial new production and a considerable fraction of the observed rates of carbon \nfixation. Spring tide fluxes were potentially in excess of the phytoplankton community\u2019s \ncapacity to uptake nitrate. This potential excess nitrate flux during spring tides may be utilised \nto support new production during the lower mixing associated with the transition towards \nneap tide. The shelf edge is shown to be a region with a significantly different phytoplankton \ncommunity compared to the adjacent Celtic Sea and NE Atlantic Ocean, highlighting the role \nof gradients in physical processes leading to gradients in ecosystem structure. \n \nSharples et al., In press, Limnology and Oceanography,52(5), 2007. 3 \nIntroduction \nThe shelf edge is an important boundary, separating the shelf seas from the open \nocean. Physical processes at the shelf edge mediate the transfer of water and its constituents \nbetween the deep ocean and the shallow shelf seas (Huthnance 1995), which is of particular \ninterest in the context of nutrient and carbon fluxes (Liu et al. 2000). Shelf edge regions have \nbeen associated with distinct biological activity, including locally enhanced growth of \nphytoplankton and controlling the distribution of fish larvae (Fernandez et al. 1993), to shelf \nedge plankton supporting marine mammals (Wishner et al. 1988) and important fisheries \n(Young et al. 2001). A number of species appear to use the shelf edge as a \u201chighway\u201d \nbetween spawning and feeding grounds (Reid 2001). \n \nThe upper shelf slope and shelf edge are often seen to be sites of enhanced internal \nmixing compared to the waters on either side. As the depth of the ocean changes between the \nopen ocean and the shelf sea, the relatively steep bathymetry of the shelf slope can lead to the \nformation of non-linear internal (often tidal) waves, which can break into internal solitons \n(illustrated schematically in Fig. 1). The propagation of these solitons can lead to significant \nfluxes across the shelf edge (Baines 1982; Inall et al. 2001), while the current shear associated \nwith them causes localised internal turbulence and mixing (e.g., Holloway et al. 2001; \nRippeth and Inall 2002; Dale et al. 2003) which ultimately dissipates the energy of the \ninternal tide. This mixing environment has a global impact through effects on oceanic \nwatermass properties (Huthnance 1995) and ocean heat fluxes (Garrett 2003). More locally \nthe enhanced turbulence and mixing can affect sediment re-suspension and distributions at the \nshelf edge (Heathershaw et al. 1987; Puig et al. 2004) and the vertical flux of deep nutrients to \nthe sea surface (Holligan et al. 1985; Brickman and Loder 1993; Sharples et al. 2001a). There \nis evidence that the altered structure of the water column caused by internal mixing at the \nshelf edge is targeted by, for instance, spawning mackerel (Bez and Rivoirard 2001).  \n \nUnderstanding the physics of the shelf edge is thus important, locally and globally, \nand in the context of sedimentology, biochemistry, and fisheries. The focus of this \ncontribution is the enhanced vertical mixing at the shelf edge of the Celtic Sea, driven by the \ninternal tide, and its effect on nitrate distributions. The internal tide in the region has been \nseen to have a peak-to-trough amplitude of over 50 m at spring tides, propagating as a \ndecaying wave both on-shelf and into the open ocean (Pingree et al. 1984). Observations have \nshown direct evidence of enhanced mixing associated with the internal wave, particularly at \nspring tides (New and Pingree 1990), with mixing at spring tides associated with the break-up \nof the internal tidal wave into trains of internal solitons (Pingree and Mardell 1985). \nModelling studies of the internal tide at the Celtic Sea shelf edge also suggest mixing to be \nSharples et al., In press, Limnology and Oceanography,52(5), 2007. 4 \nassociated more with spring tides (New 1988), with trains of shelf-ward propagating internal \nsolitons more likely to be generated at spring tides than at neap tides (Gerkema 1996). \nIncreased surface concentrations of nitrate and chlorophyll, associated with a band of cooler \nwater along the shelf edge, have been recognised for some time (Pingree and Mardell 1981). \nConsidering this increase in mixing at the shelf edge, the observed enhanced chlorophyll \ncould be the result of either locally increased growth in response to the supply of nitrate, or of \nmixing of the sub-surface thermocline phytoplankton population towards the surface. There is \nevidence supporting increased growth of phytoplankton at the shelf edge, primarily derived \nfrom observations of an increased f-ratio within the band of cooler, higher-nitrate water \n(Elskens et al. 1997; Joint et al. 2001). \n \nOur aim is to quantify the vertical supply of nitrate driven by internal mixing at the \nCeltic Sea shelf break during summer. In particular we make a first assessment of the possible \ntemporal variability in nitrate supply associated with mixing changes over the spring-neap \ntidal cycle. We do this by combining tidal-cycle measurements of turbulent dissipation, using \na free-fall turbulence sensor, with vertical profiles of nitrate close to a spring and a neap tide. \nWe interpret the results in the context of how the primary production at the shelf edge may \nrespond to the spring-neap cycle in mixing and nutrient fluxes, and show how the shelf edge \nis a biologically important boundary between the adjacent Atlantic Ocean and Celtic Sea \nshelf. \n \nMethods \nObservations were carried out during the RRS Charles Darwin cruise CD173 in July-\nAugust 2005 in the Celtic Sea (Fig. 2A), with all measurements carried out between a neap \nand a spring tide typical for the region (Fig. 2B). A station at the shelf edge (48\u00b0 34.5' N, 9\u00b0 \n30.6' W, depth = 200 m) was chosen within the band of low temperature and high chlorophyll \n(Fig. 2C, D). The ship occupied this station for two 25 hour sampling periods, between 19:00 \nh UTC 17 July and 20:00 h UTC 18 July (neap tide), and between 03:00 h UTC 23 July and \n04:00 h UTC 24 July (spring tide). The major axis of the depth-mean tidal flow was aligned \napproximately NE-SW, perpendicular to the general direction of the isobaths. During the neap \ntide sampling period the depth-mean tidal current amplitude was 0.22 m s-1. Wind speeds \nbegan at about 25 km h-1, increasing to 35 km h-1 by the end of the period. During the spring \ntide sampling period the depth-mean tidal current amplitude was 0.5 m s-1. Winds were 20 \u2013 \n25 km h-1 for most of the period, rising rapidly to 55 km h-1 between 21:00 h on the 23 July \nand 00:00 h on the 24 July, and maintaining 45 \u2013 55 km h-1 for the remainder of the period. \n \nSharples et al., In press, Limnology and Oceanography,52(5), 2007. 5 \nA mooring was deployed at the shelf edge station between 17 July and 24 July, \nproviding current and temperature profiles with high time resolution. Vemco minilog \ntemperature loggers were spaced every 10 m between the seabed and 60 m below the sea \nsurface, and every 5 m between 55 m and 15 m below the surface. A Seabird microcat was \nattached to the surface marker buoy. The Vemco loggers and the microcat recorded data with \na 1 minute sampling interval. Two 300 kHz RDI Workhorse ADCPs were deployed, one in a \nframe on the seabed and the other 100m above the seabed in a streamlined SUBS buoy \n(Ocean Seas Instrumentation Inc.).  \n \nA Seabird 911 CTD and rosette system was used to collect vertical profiles of \nsalinity, temperature, and chlorophyll fluorescence, with bottle samples collected for nutrient \nand phytoplankton pigment analysis (Table 1). The CTD was lowered at a rate of \napproximately 0.5 m s-1, sampling at 25 Hz. The CTD temperature was accurate to within the \n0.001 \u00b0C resolution of the data (based on pre-cruise and post cruise laboratory calibrations). \nCTD salinity was calibrated against salinity samples analysed against standard seawater on a \nGuildline Autosal, resulting in a measurement error in the CTD salinity data of \u00b10.003 \n(PSS78). A Chelsea Instruments Aquatracka MKIII chlorophyll fluorometer was interfaced \nwith the CTD, and also sampled at a rate of 25 Hz. The output of the fluorometer was \ncompared with discrete measurements of chlorophyll a (Chl a) from filtered water samples, \ncollected during both sampling periods. Samples were taken over the whole water column, \nincluding the surface layer, SCM, and deeper water, to cover the entire range of Chl a \nconcentrations (Table 1).  Chl a in each sample was determined following the procedure of \nWelschmeyer (1994) using a Turner A-10 fluorometer calibrated with a Chl a standard \n(Sigma, UK) in 90% acetone. The subsequent regression (n=58, r2=0.8) provided a calibration \nof the CTD fluorescence with a rms error of \u00b10.2 mg Chl a m-3. Samples for flow cytometry \n(2 mL) were collected from within the peak of the SCM, preserved in paraformaldehyde and \nthen immediately frozen at -80 \u00b0C for return to the laboratory. Analysis was performed using \na Beckton Dickinson FACSort flow cytometer. Phytoplankton samples were also collected \nfrom the peak of the SCM and preserved in 1-2% acidic Lugols solution. The major taxa were \nenumerated using a Leica DMIRB light microscope. Nitrate + nitrite was analysed in samples \ntaken from the CTD rosette (Table 1), using standard colorimetric methods (Grasshof et al. \n1983) with a Skalar Autoanalyser. The detection limit was 0.1 mmol m-3, with a typical \nmeasurement error (based on replicate analyses during the cruise) of \u00b1 0.6%. \n \nFor both occupations of the shelf edge station profiles of daily primary productivity \nwere constructed for a range of surface light conditions using information on the light-\nSharples et al., In press, Limnology and Oceanography,52(5), 2007. 6 \ndependent rates of carbon fixation, in situ spectral light field, and Chl a following methods \nsimilar to Lorenzo et al. (2004). Light-dependent rates of carbon fixation for each sampling \nperiod were obtained at four depths between the surface and base of the SCM from standard \n14C Photosynthesis vs. Irradiance (PE) curves adjusted to in situ light fields using measured \nphytoplankton absorption spectra (Moore et al. 2006). PE parameters were interpolated \nlinearly through the water column and assumed constant throughout the day. Photoinhibition \nwas assumed to have negligible effect on the results integrated between the sea surface and \nthe base of the SCM. Spectral reconstruction of in situ light fields was achieved using a mean \nvalue of transmittance through the air-water interface, average in-water surface spectra, and \nattenuation vs. Chl a relationships at six wavelengths, using data obtained from a \nSATLANTIC profiler. \n \nMeasurements of turbulent dissipation, \u03b5  (m2 s-3), were carried out using the FLY \nfree-fall microstructure probe (Dewey et al. 1987). FLY carries two shear sensors, sampled at \n274 Hz while the profiler free-falls to the seabed at a speed of 0.7 \u2013 0.8 m s-1. Subsequent \nanalysis of the shear data to provide profiles of turbulent dissipation followed that described \nby Rippeth et al. (2003). FLY also carries temperature and conductivity sensors, providing \nvertical profiles of temperature, salinity, and density concomitant with the dissipation profiles. \nProfiles of vertical turbulent diffusion, zK , can be calculated for each of the individual \ndissipation profiles by (Osborn 1980) \n2Kz N\n\u03b5\n= \u0393   (m2 s-1)   (1) \n \nThe factor \u0393 , often referred to as the mixing efficiency, is taken to be constant at 0.2. The \nbuoyancy frequency, N (s-1), can be calculated using the density profile ( \u03c1 , kg  m-3) \nmeasured by FLY \n2 gN\nz\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\n\u2202\uf8eb \uf8f6= \u2212 \uf8ec \uf8f7\u2202\uf8ed \uf8f8\n  (s-2)  (2) \n \nwith g = 9.81 m s-2 and z the depth (metres, positive upward).  \n \nIn principle the sampling method aimed at using CTD and FLY data to provide \ntidally-resolved estimates of vertical turbulent fluxes of nitrate, 3NO  (mmol m\n-3),  via: \n3\n3\nNO\nNO Kflux z z\n\u2202\uf8eb \uf8f6\n= \u2212 \uf8ec \uf8f7\uf8ec \uf8f7\u2202\uf8ed \uf8f8\n (mmol m-2 s-1)     (3) \nSharples et al., In press, Limnology and Oceanography,52(5), 2007. 7 \nwith 3\n\u2202\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\u2202\uf8ed \uf8f8\nNO\nz\n (mmol m-4) the vertical gradient of nitrate (Sharples et al 2001b). During both \nsampling periods ensembles of 5 \u2013 6 sequential FLY profiles were carried out approximately \nevery hour, with an ensemble taking typically 40 minutes to carry out. Vertical profiles of the \nCTD (Table 1) were carried out to provide a density-nitrate relation that could then be applied \nto the FLY density profiles for the calculation of the vertical nitrate gradient through the base \nof the SCM. A particular advantage of having a reliable density-nitrate relation is that the \nnitrate gradient and the turbulent diffusivity measurements can then be taken from the same \ninstrument at the same time, avoiding uncertainties associated with separation both in time \nand space when the diffusivity is measured using FLY and the nitrate gradient is taken from \nseparate CTD casts (e.g., Sharples et al. 2001b). Throughout both sampling periods the SCM \nfinished at or just above the \u03c3t=27.0 kg m-3 isopycnal (Fig. 3A, B). The CTD sampling \nprovided sufficient nitrate data to generate a reliable linear density-nitrate regression for each \nsampling period within the base of the SCM (Fig. 3C, D). This linear density-nitrate \nrelationship allows a combination of Eqs. 1-3 to simplify the estimation of the nitrate flux into \nthe base of the SCM to: \n 3NO mflux g\n\u03b5\u03c1\u0393\n=   (mmol m-2 s-1)  (4) \n \nwith m the nitrate-density gradient (mmol m-3 (kg m-3)-1). Because of the vertical movement of \nthe isopycnals associated with the internal tide, nitrate fluxes were calculated at isopycnals \nrather than isobars. In order for there to be sufficient observations to allow reliable time series \nthrough the tidal cycles, the instantaneous fluxes into the base of the SCM were calculated as \nthe average within \u00b10.1 kg m-3 of the 26.8 kg m-3 isopycnal (Fig. 3A, B). For both sampling \nperiods this range of 26.7 \u2013 26.9 kg m-3 was always situated within the lower SCM. With each \nFLY profile thus providing a measure of the nitrate flux into the SCM, an ensemble of 5 \u2013 6 \nFLY profiles then resulted in an ensemble mean nitrate flux with 95% confidence limits \ncalculated using a bootstrapping technique (Efron and Gong 1983). Similarly, a daily mean \nSCM nitrate flux with confidence intervals was calculated by combining all available flux \nestimates for sampling period. \n \nResults \nExample CTD profiles illustrate the typical temperature, salinity, Chl a, and nitrate \nstructure observed during the two sampling periods (Fig. 4A, B), showing a broad SCM \nreaching from the base of the thermocline towards the surface. During the neap tide sampling \nperiod nitrate was consistently just above the detection limit at a depth of 15 m, and below \nSharples et al., In press, Limnology and Oceanography,52(5), 2007. 8 \ndetection above a depth of 10 m. During the spring tide sampling period nitrate was \nsometimes detectable at a depth of 2 m. \n \nComparing the calibrated fluorescence profiles with the chlorophyll samples confirms \nthe existence of an identifiable SCM, though for the neap tide example (Fig. 4A) there is an \nindication of fluorescence quenching in the upper 10 m that falsely enhances the contrast \nbetween the SCM chlorophyll concentration and that at the surface. Both of the examples \nshow significant spiking in the fluorescence-based chlorophyll profiles on vertical scales of 1 \n\u2013 2 metres (i.e., close to the vertical averaging interval of the CTD data). Such spikes are \nsometimes thought to be the result of large diatom cells being sampled by the fluorometer. \nAnother possibility is the existence of layers of cells within the SCM. Due to both vessel \nmotion and some difficulties in controlling the CTD winch veer rate, the CTD data was not of \na quality to allow high resolution sampling through the SCM. However, there is evidence \n(Fig. 5) that chlorophyll spikes within the SCM could be consistent between 2 or 3 adjacent \nCTD casts, possibly associated with small scale structure (i.e. 1 \u2013 5 metres) in the density \nprofile. These layers are perhaps analogous to the thin layers seen in lower turbulence \nenvironments (e.g., McManus et al. 2003); their existence is intriguing as they could \npotentially provide us with some information on the structure of the mixing through the SCM. \n \nThe spatial context of this shelf edge temperature, chlorophyll, and nitrate is provided \nby a cross-shelf edge transect of CTD profiles carried out on 21-22 July (Fig. 6). The structure \nof the thermocline at the shelf edge was broader than either on-shelf or off-shelf (Fig. 6A), \nwith a reduction of the shelf edge surface temperature by about 1.5\u00b0C compared to the \nadjacent on-shelf and off-shelf waters. This patch of broader thermocline and cooler shelf \nedge water was coincident with high surface layer chlorophyll (Fig. 6B), comparable to the \nhighest chlorophyll concentrations off-shelf and on-shelf found below the sea surface in the \nSCM. Similarly the nitracline at the shelf break was broadened (Fig. 6C), with detectable \nconcentrations of nitrate at the sea surface just on-shelf from the 200 m isobath and \ncorresponding with the region of elevated surface chlorophyll concentrations. The \ncorresponding sample analyses of the SCM phytoplankton population showed significant \ncross-shelf edge contrasts (Fig. 7). Flow cytometer analysis of samples from the peak of the \nSCM (Fig. 7A) showed a significant change in the proportion of prokaryotes and eukaryotes \nbetween the highly stratified waters and the shelf edge region. Prokaryotes, specifically \nProchlorococcus and Synechococcus, dominated in the stratified oceanic and shelf waters \nrespectively. Conversely these oligotrophic organisms were largely absent from shelf edge \nwaters where small eukaryotes instead dominated the picophytoplankton community. Size-\nfractionated chlorophyll measurements (not shown) indicated that larger eukaryotes were \nSharples et al., In press, Limnology and Oceanography,52(5), 2007. 9 \ntypically much more abundant at the shelf edge than in oceanic and shelf waters. The >10\u00b5m \nfraction comprised 50-80% of the community at the shelf edge while picoplankton (<2\u00b5m) \ncomprised <30%. Conversely on the shelf and in the oceanic waters picoplankton frequently \ndominated and large (>10\u00b5m) eukaryotes rarely accounted for >30% of community \nchlorophyll. Analysis of the species within one group (the diatoms) showed marked \ndifferences across the shelf edge (Fig. 7B). One species (Leptocylindricus mediterraneus) was \nfound predominantly on the Atlantic side of the shelf edge, while another (Pseudonitzschia \nsp) was found mainly at the shelf edge and over the shelf. Cells of Navicula were only found \nat the shelf edge. Rhizosolenia stlyiformis and Proboscia alata, both species that tend to \nfavour stable environments, were absent at the shelf edge.  \n \nThe longer term context of the variability of the shelf edge water column structure, \nboth during the two occupations of the station and between the two occupations, illustrates the \nbehaviour of the internal tidal motions (Fig. 8). The 12\u00b0C isotherm shows a consistent tidal \noscillation between neap and spring tides (Fig. 8A), with a typical mid-water peak-to-trough \nvariation of 50 \u2013 60 m. These oscillations sometimes exhibited quite large, bore-like jumps; \nthe four tidal oscillations between noon on 20 July and midnight on 22 July were all \nassociated with marked high-amplitude, high-frequency signals at a depth of 50 m. Extracts \nfrom the mooring temperature time series, covering the times of the neap tide and spring tide \noccupations of the shelf edge site, suggest overall tidal amplitudes of isotherm displacements \nto be slightly lower during the spring tide sampling period (Fig. 8B, C). At both neap and \nspring tides the thermocline reached its maximum downward displacement at maximum off-\nshelf barotropic flow (Fig. 8D, E).  While high frequency variability superimposed on the \ntidal oscillations was a persistent feature of both neap and spring tides, there was a marked \ncontrast in the strength of this higher variability (Fig. 8B, C). There were 20 \u2013 30 minute \nperiod oscillations of isotherms in the upper 50 m throughout the neap tide sampling (Fig. \n8B), with peak-trough ranges of about 10 m. During the spring tide sampling (Fig. 8C) high \nfrequency wave ranges were typically 20 \u2013 40 m, with particularly strong pulses of waves as \nthe base of the thermocline reached its shallowest depth (e.g., 03:00 h and 15:00 h UTC 23 \nJuly, and 03:00 h UTC 24 July).  \n \nA strong burst of high frequency internal waves was observed in the mooring time \nseries between 15:00 h and 16:00 h UTC on 23 July (Fig. 8C). At 14:45 h UTC a series of 5 \u2013 \n6 internal wave bands passing the ship were identifiable on the ship\u2019s radar. Tracking one of \nthe waves on the radar, and accounting for the ship\u2019s movement, suggested a wave speed of \nabout 0.3 m s-1 onto the shelf. The ensemble of FLY profiles that began at 14:16 h UTC was \nSharples et al., In press, Limnology and Oceanography,52(5), 2007. 10 \nextended to cover at least 2 or 3 of the waves passing the vessel. The appearance of the waves \nin the mooring time series after the time of the FLY ensemble and observation on the ship\u2019s \nradar is consistent with the wave travel speed and the cross-shelf distance between the ship \nand the mooring. This event highlights a problem in sampling the intermittency of wave \nevents apparent in the mooring time series with the sampling resolution of the FLY \nensembles. The situation is further complicated when considering that there could be a 0.5 \u2013 2 \nkm distance between the ship and the mooring, so that identifying the timing of FLY \nensembles against the mooring time series is not a reliable guide in determining whether or \nnot a high frequency internal wave event was sampled by FLY. We will return to this problem \nduring the discussion in the context of the implications for uncertainties in the nitrate flux \ncalculations when the fluxes appear to be controlled by discrete mixing events.  \n \nThe observed turbulent dissipation (Fig. 9A, B) shows the expected high dissipation \nassociated with bed friction, with typically an order of magnitude more dissipation at spring \ntides compared to neap tides consistent with the spring tidal current amplitude being \napproximately twice that at neaps. During both sampling periods significant turbulent \ndissipation was also observed in the interior of the water column. At the neap tide (Fig. 9A) \nthis interior dissipation exhibited a tidal periodicity and reached typically 10-4 \u2013 10-3 m2 s-3 \nnear or below the 27.1 kg m-3 isopycnal. Interior dissipation during the spring tide (Fig. 9B) \nwas observed to be generally 1 \u2013 5 x 10-4 m2 s-3 close to the 26.9 kg m-3 isopycnal, i.e., a \nslightly lower rate than the neap tide but higher up within the pycnocline and in the base of \nthe SCM.  \n \nThe supply rate of nitrate to the SCM during the neap tide sampling period (Fig. 9C) \nranged between 0.02 and 0.11 mmol m-2 h-1 and showed no clear tidal oscillation of the nitrate \nflux. During the spring tide sampling period (Fig. 9D) the flux ranged from 0.02 and 0.74 \nmmol m-2 h-1, dominated by peaks associated with the high dissipation events at the 26.8 kg \nm-3 isopycnal. It is these peaks that are primarily responsible for leading to a higher daily-\naveraged spring tide nitrate supply to the SCM (3.5 (2.3 \u2013 5.2, 95% confidence interval) \nmmol m-2 d-1) compared to the neap tide daily average (1.3 (0.9 \u2013 1.8, 95% confidence \ninterval) mmol m-2 d-1). The daily mean vertical eddy diffusivities (with 95% confidence \nintervals) within the base of the SCM were 1.2 (0.8 \u2013 1.8) x 10-4 m2 s-1 for the neap tide, and \n6.5 (3.1 \u2013 10.3) x 10-4 m2 s-1 for the spring tide. \n \nDiscussion and Conclusions \nObservations of the vertical nitrate flux into the base of the SCM at the Celtic Sea \nshelf edge in summer suggest a difference of a factor of almost 3 between spring tides (3.5 \nSharples et al., In press, Limnology and Oceanography,52(5), 2007. 11 \nmmol m-2 d-1) and neap tides (1.3 mmol m-2 d-1). The higher nitrate flux at spring tides \nresulted from pulses of strong turbulent dissipation occurring within the base of the SCM \nassociated with high frequency internal solitons. During neap tides the highest mid-water \nturbulent dissipation was observed below the SCM, and high frequency waves were much \nweaker compared to springs.  \n \nOur discussion will focus on three issues. (1) Given the event-based nature of the \nhigher spring tide nitrate flux, can we be sure that we have sampled the flux time series \nsufficiently to yield a reliable daily flux estimate, and if not can we quantify the likely \nadditional uncertainty? (2) How do the vertical nitrate fluxes and inferred limits on new \nproduction compare with other oceanographic environments? (3) What are the consequences \nof the spring-neap contrast in the vertical nitrate flux for primary productivity at the shelf \nedge, and does the shelf edge phytoplankton ecosystem respond distinctly to the physical \nenvironment compared to the adjacent shelf and open ocean? \n \nIn addressing whether or not we adequately sampled the flux time series we can take \nadvantage of having the rapid-sampling temperature time series from the mooring adjacent to \nthe ship\u2019s station at the shelf edge. During the spring tide the mooring data (Fig. 8C) suggests \nthat particularly strong pulses of internal wave activity within the SCM occurred periodically \nevery tidal cycle. Also, the largest nitrate flux estimate (at about 19:30 h UTC on 23 July, Fig. \n9D) appeared to coincide with the passage of a single large soliton (Fig. 8C). Thus, while the \nFLY sampling of turbulent dissipation illustrated in Fig. 8C may be sufficient to yield a \nreliable daily mean flux estimate if the flux varies smoothly over a tidal cycle, the dominance \nof these short-lived mixing events suggests that instead we need to consider the possibility \nthat we missed some of them. For instance, we know that we were only able to sample just \nunder half of the packet of internal waves observed on the ships radar during the spring tide \nsampling period. Similarly there are internal wave events evident in the mooring time series \nthat are not reflected in the flux time series, suggesting that FLY did not adequately sample \nthem (e.g., 03:00 h UTC, 12:30 h UTC, and 13:30 h UTC on 23 July; Fig. 8C). Of the 25 \nhours occupation of the station during the spring tide, FLY profiles were carried out for a total \nof 9.4 hours, or 38% of the time. Assuming that there was sufficient variability in the timing \nof the FLY profiles over the 2 tidal cycles (i.e., measurements were not in phase with the tidal \nvariability), then 38% of the mixing events were sampled with FLY. If these events dominate \nthe daily flux estimate, ideally sampling all of the events could raise the daily averaged spring \ntide nitrate flux to about 9 mmol m-2 d-1. A similar analysis for the neap tide sampling period \nraises the neap tide daily mean nitrate flux to about 4 mmol m-2 d-1. However, in the case of \nthe neap tide it is far less apparent from either the FLY time series (Fig. 9C) or the mooring \nSharples et al., In press, Limnology and Oceanography,52(5), 2007. 12 \ntime series (Fig. 8B) that the nitrate flux was determined by isolated, discreet events. Thus the \noriginal estimate of 1.3 mmol m-2 d-1 is likely to be a better reflection of the true neap tide \nnitrate supply to the SCM. \n \nThe observed stronger thermocline mixing and vertical nitrate flux at spring tide, \ncompared to neaps, agrees with previous work that has shown the importance of spring tides \nfor internal mixing at the Celtic Sea shelf edge (New and Pingree 1990). The increased \ninternal mixing at spring tides is probably the reason for the similar internal tidal wave \namplitudes observed at neap and spring tides, with more energy having been dissipated from \nthe internal tide at springs. The contrast between the spring tide, with vertical fluxes being \ndriven by events of internal solitons, and neap tides where little soliton activity was observed, \nis consistent with previous observations (Pingree and Mardell 1985) and numerical modelling \nof the region (Gerkema 1996). The difference in sea level range between the neap and spring \nsampling periods in this study was typical for the large neap-spring changes in the region \n(Fig. 2B), indicating that there could be a marked spring-neap cycle in vertical nitrate flux as \na result of the spring tide solitons. However, spring tides on 8 July and 8 August were \nsubstantially weaker than the spring tide sampled on 23\/24 July, and we have no evidence that \nsolitons would have been generated at these weaker spring tides. It is therefore possible that \nthe strong monthly modulation of the strength of spring tides may mean that the vertical \nnitrate flux is pulsed on a monthly rather than fortnightly time scale. \n \nThe neap tide estimate of vertical flux of nitrate at the shelf edge of the Celtic Sea is \nsimilar to flux measurements made in a strongly-stratified water column in the western \nEnglish Channel (Sharples et al. 2001b). There the daily mean flux of about 2 mmol m-2 d-1 \nwas thought to be the result of tidally-driven boundary turbulence impacting the base of the \nthermocline, rather than internal waves. Vertical nitrate fluxes comparable to spring tides at \nthe Celtic Sea shelf edge have also been found within the tidal mixing front off Georges Bank \n(Horne et al. 1996), where primary production rates were also seen to be enhanced compared \nto waters on either side of the front. \n \nWithout taking into account the potential for under sampling of mixing events during \nspring tides, the spring tide daily mean diffusivity in the base of the SCM at the Celtic Sea \nshelf edge (6.5 x 10-4 m2 s-1) is similar to that measured in an internal tide dominated \nenvironment at the shelf edge of NE New Zealand (Sharples et al. 2001a). The weaker nitrate \nflux at the Celtic Sea shelf edge (3.5 mmol m-2 d-1 compared to 12 mmol m-2 d-1 off New \nZealand) is a result of lower sub-thermocline nitrate concentrations and a subsequently lower \nvertical nitrate gradient. Taking into account the event-driven nature of the internal tide-\nSharples et al., In press, Limnology and Oceanography,52(5), 2007. 13 \ndriven nitrate flux in the Celtic Sea does bring the flux estimate closer to that of NE New \nZealand. However, if vertical fluxes driven by non-linear internal tides are dominated by \nmixing events associated with the passage of solitons, the NE New Zealand fluxes could also \nbe under-estimated. \n \nAssessing the potential importance of the vertical nitrate flux to enhancing new \nproduction at the shelf edge needs to start with an estimate of how much production can be \nmaintained by the fluxes. Phytoplankton C:N ratios tend, on average, to be close to the \nRedfield ratio, but can vary both through time and between groups (e.g., Geider and La Roche \n2002). If we assume phytoplankton growth maintains an approximate C:N Redfield ratio of \n6.6, then the neap tide vertical flux of nitrate could support new carbon fixation of 120 mg C \nm-2 d-1. At spring tides the increased nitrate flux could support enhanced new production of \nbetween 320 and 830 mg C m-2 d-1, with the higher rate taking into account under-sampling of \nthe mixing events. Water column estimates of primary production during the OMEX project \n(Joint et al. 2001) show rates in July to be typically 400 mg C m-2 d-1, with a quarter of that \nbeing fuelled by nitrate from below the thermocline. This earlier estimate is consistent with \nour neap tide nitrate flux, but would imply that our observed spring tide nitrate flux is in \nexcess of the monthly-mean nitrate uptake capacity. \n \nFurther insight into the behaviour of the primary production can be gained by \nconsidering the measured nitrate fluxes alongside the detailed observations of primary \nproduction. At neap tides the capacity for carbon fixation between the base of the SCM and \nthe sea surface was estimated to range between 370 and 800 mg C m-2 d-1, with the range \nbased on the cloudiest and sunniest days experienced during the cruise. This suggests that all \nof the neap tide daily mean nitrate supply could be utilised by the phytoplankton, with an f-\nratio of between 0.14 and 0.32. With the reasonable assumption that the nitrate flux will not \nchange with surface irradiance this implies that the use of locally regenerated nitrogen would \nhave to be increased on sunny days. \n \nThe observed carbon fixation capacity at spring tides was slightly less than that at \nneaps, ranging between 290 and 600 mg C m-2 d-1, reflecting a lower chlorophyll standing \nstock and indicating potential acclimation to the more stable light environment at neap tides. \nUsing the original estimate of the spring nitrate flux this would suggest an f-ratio between 0.5 \nand 1. Taking into account the likely underestimate of the nitrate flux due to under-sampling \nof mixing events would imply that the supply of nitrate was well in excess of phytoplankton \nnitrogen requirements at spring tides. This inability of the phytoplankton population to take \nup the supplied nitrate at spring tide is supported by the observation of nitrate in the surface \nSharples et al., In press, Limnology and Oceanography,52(5), 2007. 14 \nsamples during the spring tide sampling period, and by the generally higher spring tide \nsurface layer nitrate implied by the temperature-nitrate relationships for the two sampling \nperiods (Fig. 3C, D). The phytoplankton community thus appears to require a few days to take \nup the available nitrate and utilise it, and to reduce the surface layer nitrate back to neap tide \nvalues. A simple model illustrates this proposed mechanism whereby the build-up of \nchlorophyll in response to the spring-neap cycle in vertical nitrate flux lags the peak flux. \nUsing the upper (spring tide) and lower (neap tide) limits of nitrate fluxes observed, the \nnitrate flux to the surface layer is described as \n( )5.15 2.85sin3NO tflux SN\u03c9= +  (mmol m-2 d-1)  (5) \n \nwith SN\u03c9 = 0.425 d\n-1 the spring-neap angular frequency and t  (d) is time. The model assumes \nthat the nitrate flux is all instantly converted into increased phytoplankton biomass (Chl a) \nwithin the surface layer using a fixed ratio of 1.59 g Chl a (mol N)-1 (Platt et al. 2003), and \nthat grazing and other loss terms balance the supply of nitrate over the full spring-neap cycle: \n1.59 3NOChl flux G\nt MLD\n\u2202\uf8eb \uf8f6 = \u2212\uf8ec \uf8f7\u2202\uf8ed \uf8f8\n  (mg m-3 d-1) (6) \n \n The surface layer was taken to be MLD = 40 metres, and the loss term G = 0.2 d-1 in order \nto balance the growth over the spring neap cycle. A minimum \u201cbackground\u201d chlorophyll \nconcentration was set at 0.9 mg m-3. In the simple case presented (Fig. 10) the build-up of \npigment lags the maximal flux by ~3.5 days. This is consistent with an estimate of the \nphytoplankton carbon turnover rate. With a mean standing stock of about 2 g C m-2 in the \nupper 40 m (taking a mean Chl a stock of 50 mg Chl m-2 and assuming C:Chl\u224840), and a \nmeasured typical growth rate of 0.5 g C m-2 d-1, leads to a carbon turnover rate of 4 days. \n \nThis slow growth response, which potentially arises from light limitation driven by \nthe internal mixing, could allow the build-up of surface nitrate. If the upper ocean system is \ncapable of storing this excess nitrate, the unutilized nitrate supply driven during the spring \ntides could then provide fuel for later growth during increased stability towards the next neap \ntide, leading to further delay in growth and a peak standing stock in the surface waters several \ndays after spring tides. Approaching the next spring tide would then not only begin the re-\nsupply of nitrate, but would also remove some of the biomass into the deeper water below the \nSCM. This implies a potential for fortnightly pulsing of primary production at the shelf edge \n(or monthly, if weaker spring tides generate fewer internal solitons), with the biomass lagging \nSharples et al., In press, Limnology and Oceanography,52(5), 2007. 15 \nthe supply of nitrate. The extent of this pulsed response to nitrate mixing would also be \nmodulated by the available light. \n \nThe suggested mechanism for a delayed growth response to spring tide nitrate fluxes \narises from our observations of neap-spring contrasts in vertical mixing and nitrate fluxes, \ncoupled with the measurements of primary production. While the observed higher surface \nwater nitrate at spring tides and the higher neap tide surface biomass are consistent with this \nmechanism, our observations are not sufficient to rule out other reasons for the neap-spring \ncontrasts in surface nitrate and biomass. One obvious alternative in this region of significant \nalong-slope flows (e.g., Huthnance et al. 2001) is simply the advection of different water \nproperties into the region between the two sampling periods. Further investigation would \nrequire an understanding of the along-shelf edge gradients, and would benefit from the use of \na coupled numerical model of the shelf edge and internal tide. \n \nIn addition to the mixing environment increasing new primary production at the shelf \nedge (Joint et al. 2001), this narrow, physically distinct region is also associated with a \nmarked shift in phytoplankton community structure compared to the adjacent Celtic Sea and \nNE Atlantic Ocean (Fig. 7). Overall the larger eukaryotes dominated the shelf edge, compared \nto picoplankton dominance on and off the shelf. Within the eukaryotes there was also a \nchange in species across the shelf edge, with species generally associated with stable \nenvironments absent from the region of internal tide mixing. Thus the gradient of physical \nprocesses from the shelf, across the shelf edge, and into the open Atlantic is associated with \nsignificant changes in the community structure of the phytoplankton, and the vertical internal \nmixing at the shelf edge is not simply redistributing an otherwise horizontally uniform \npopulation of cells. Rather the stronger mixing and the resultant upward flux of nutrients \nresults in a shift in community structure from prokaryote domination on and off shelf to a \ngreater proportion of eukaryotes and larger cells at the shelf edge. Such an increase in \ncommunity size structure is typical of enhanced nutrient availability (Chisholm 1992). \n \nIn summary, we have quantified a spring-neap contrast in the vertical flux of nitrate \nto the SCM at the shelf edge of the Celtic Sea in summer. The larger flux during the spring \ntide is a result of the internal turbulent dissipation occurring within the base of the SCM, \nrather than any overall increase in internal turbulence compared to neap tides, and was \ndominated by short mixing events. A simple assessment of the implications of the flux \ndependence on these short events leads to a substantial increase in the estimate of the spring \ntide vertical nitrate flux. The shelf edge new production supportable by the observed neap tide \nnitrate fluxes is consistent with both earlier work and with primary productivity \nSharples et al., In press, Limnology and Oceanography,52(5), 2007. 16 \nmeasurements made during the flux estimates. During spring tides, however, nitrate fluxes \nwere likely to be in excess of the capacity of the primary producers to utilise it \ninstantaneously; we suggest that this could lead to a fortnightly cycle of nitrate supply during \nspring tides followed by utilisation and growth towards neaps. We have also provided \nevidence for a link between the gradients in physical processes across the shelf edge and \nchanges in the community structure of the phytoplankton at both group and species levels. An \ninteresting (and ambitious) topic for further research would be to understand the physiological \nmechanisms behind the changes in community structure, and to assess them in the context of \nthe productivity at higher trophic levels often seen in the shelf edge ecosystem. \n \nReferences \nBAINES, P.G. 1982.

(A) \nDuring off-shelf ebb barotropic tidal flow the thermocline is depressed over the shelf edge \nand upper slope, forming the main internal tidal wave (wavelength typically 10 \u2013 30 km). (B) \nAs the ebb tidal flow decreases this internal tidal wave propagates both on- and off-shelf, \nforming shorter internal waves; the short internal waves that cross the shelf edge towards the \nshallower shelf water can steepen and increase in amplitude. (C) During the early the flood \ntide the train of internal solitary waves can further shorten (typically to \u223c 1km) and steepen in \nthe shallower shelf water, leading to high current shear and subsequent localised vertical \nmixing as the waves quickly dissipate. The amplitude of the initial internal tidal wave, and the \npotential for it to dissipate on the shelf via internal solitary waves, is strongly dependent on \nthe strength of the barotropic tidal currents. The arrows indicate the direction and strength of \nthe barotropic tidal currents.

The box in panel A indicates \nthe area covered by satellite images of (C) sea surface temperature and (D) sea surface \nchlorophyll. In panels C and D the white circle at the shelf edge is the position of the site of \nthe neap and spring tide sampling periods. The line across the shelf edge is the location of the \nCTD transect. Satellite images (AVHRR and MODIS) are composites for 11 \u2013 13 July 2005, \ncourtesy of the Remote Sensing Data Analysis Service, Plymouth Marine Laboratory. \n \nFigure 3. \nDistribution of Chl a measurements against \u03c3t for all CTD casts during (A) the neap tide \nsampling period and (B) the spring tide sampling period, and the nitrate-\u03c3t relationship within \nthe lower half of the SCM for all nitrate samples collected during (C) the neap tide sampling \nperiod and (D) the spring tide sampling period. The grey region in panels A and B indicates \nthe \u03c3t limits through which the nitrate fluxes into the base of the SCM are calculated. The \nslopes, m, of the linear regressions in panels C and D are used in Equation 4. The dashed line \nin panel D is the neap tide regression repeated from panel C, indicating the increase in nitrate \nthroughout the SCM during spring tides. \n \nFigure 4. \nExample CTD cast data from (A) 07:20 h UTC 18 July during the neap tide sampling period, \nand (B) 04:00 h UTC 24 July during the spring tide sampling period. \n \nFigure 5. \nAn example of the coherence of spikes in the fluorescence-derived vertical profiles of \nchlorophyll across 3 of the spring tide CTDs.

CTD station \nnumbers correspond to those marked in Fig. 6A. The \u201cstable water\u201d species in panel B are \nRhizosolenia styliformis and Proboscia alata. Samples were collected from the peak of the \nSCM. Comparison with other samples from within the SCM did not indicate any significant \nvertical variations in community structure. \n \nFigure 8. \nVariations in the vertical temperature structure between neap and spring tides, recorded by the \nmoored temperature loggers for (A) the whole mooring deployment, (B) the neap tide \nsampling period, and (C) the spring tide sampling period; the shaded bars indicate the times \nduring which FLY ensembles were conducted. Depth-averaged cross-shelf velocities are \nshown for (D) the neap and (E) the spring sampling periods; positive flow is on-shelf. \n \nFigure 9. \nTime series of turbulent dissipation (colours) and \u03c3t (lines) for (A) the neap tide sampling \nperiod and (B) the spring tide sampling period. Turbulent dissipation is ensemble averaged, \nwith the mean time of the FLY ensembles indicated by the vertical lines. Isopycnals are \nshown every 0.2 kg m-3. (C) and (D) are the time series of the vertical nitrate fluxes through \nthe base of the thermocline during the neap and spring tide sampling periods respectively; in \neach case the flux was calculated between the dashed contours shown in panels A and B. \nVertical bars in panels C and D are 95% confidence intervals. Note that the gap at the start of \nthe spring time series panels B and D results from having only one successful FLY profile at \nthe start of the sampling period, which could not be used to estimate a mean dissipation and \nflux. \n \nFigure 10. \nResults of the simple model (Eq. 6) linking a spring-neap (A) cycle in nitrate flux to a (B) \ncycle in chlorophyll biomass, illustrating the lag of biomass behind the nitrate supply. In \npanel A the circles are the nitrate flux observations used to set the limits of the spring-neap \nflux time series used by the model. In panel B the circles are the mean surface layer \nchlorophyll concentrations averaged over all CTD casts during the two sampling period. The \nerror bars in panel B are \u00b1 one standard deviation of the sampling period averages. \nSharples et al., In press, Limnology and Oceanography,52(5), 2007. 21 \n \n \nSampling \nperiod \nCTD times \n(UTC) \nSample depths (m) \n17\/18 July 18:57 h 17 July \n07:20 h 18 July \n \n12:02 h 18 July \n18:39 h 18 July \n2, 15, 25, 35, 43, 60, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175 \n2, 5, 10, 15, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 80, 100, 120, \n140, 160, 180, 200 \n2, 20, 40, 60, 70, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200 \n2, 15, 25, 40, 50, 60, 70, 90, 110, 130, 150, 170 \n23\/24 July 03:00 h 23 July \n \n10:32 h 23 July \n15:25 h 23 July \n \n20:00 h 23 July \n23:07 h 23 July \n04:04 h 24 July \n2, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 120, 140, 160, \n180 \n2, 10, 30, 60, 80 \n2, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 175 \n2, 20, 40, 60, 80 \n2, 20, 40, 60, 80 \n2, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, 100, 120, 155 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 1 \n \n \nSharples et al., In press, Limnology and Oceanography,52(5), 2007. 22 \n \n \nSharples et al., In press, Limnology and Oceanography,52(5), 2007. 23 \n \n \nSharples et al., In press, Limnology and Oceanography,52(5), 2007. 24 \n \n \nSharples et al., In press, Limnology and Oceanography,52(5), 2007. 25 \n \n \nSharples et al., In press, Limnology and Oceanography,52(5), 2007. 26 \n \n \nSharples et al., In press, Limnology and Oceanography,52(5), 2007. 27 \n \n \nSharples et al., In press, Limnology and Oceanography,52(5), 2007. 28 \n \n \nSharples et al., In press, Limnology and Oceanography,52(5), 2007. 29 \n \n \n \nSharples et al., In press, Limnology and Oceanography,52(5), 2007. 30 \n \n \nSharples et al., In press, Limnology and Oceanography,52(5), 2007. 31 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"}
