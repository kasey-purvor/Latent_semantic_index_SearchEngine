[DOI: 10.1063\/1.1825613]\nINTRODUCTION\nThere has long been an interest in the diffusion of III-V\nsemiconductors.1 Because diffusion causes spatial variations\nin compositions, intermixing of heterostructures can alter\ntheir lattice parameter and the band gap energy. This diffu-\nsion can be undesirable when a device requires an abrupt\nchange of composition, or it can be locally encouraged for\ndesign purposes by an appropriate capping or ion implanta-\ntion to generate complex three-dimensional patterning.\nA pseudomorphic crystalline quantum well is an ideal\nsystem to monitor diffusion as wells can be accurately grown\nand small diffusion lengths significantly alter their physical\nproperties. Simple photoluminescence measurements, as a\nfunction of the annealing time of a quantum well, show\nchanges in the recombination energy of excitons. These\nshifts in the photoluminescence energy are the direct result\nof the diffusion. By measuring how the photoluminescence\nof a single quantum well varies with annealing and by mod-\neling this shift, using a simple Fickian diffusion model with\na concentration independent diffusion coefficient, we have\nbeen able to determine the diffusion coefficient over a wide\ntemperature range and consequently measure the activation\nenergy for diffusion.2 Although this modeling technique has\nbeen widely used, our group pioneered the use of repetitive\nannealing of a single sample as a means of demonstrating the\nvalidity of the model through the linear variation of the mea-\nsured diffusion length squared against anneal time. Despite\nthis, there have been reports in the literature that have sug-\ngested that the diffusion might be concentration or strain\ndependant.1,3,4 It is also true that departure from the above\nlinear variation can be difficult to detect because the nonlin-\nearity is not always dramatic5 and also because of a lack of\ndata or scatter in the data points.\nHigh resolution x-ray diffraction (HRXRD) can offer a\ndescription of low-dimensional semiconductor structures and\nthe distribution of diffusing species,6\u20139 especially in simple\nsystems. InGaAs\/GaAs is such a system as the extent and\nintensity of the strained domain generated by the distribution\nof indium in the specimen can be accurately measured. The\nrepeated annealing of a single quantum well (SQW) speci-\nmen, coupled with photoluminescence and HRXRD mea-\nsurements, shows beyond doubt that the Fickian model with\na constant diffusion coefficient is inadequate, and that a\nsimple square well model provides a better fit to all the ex-\nperimental data. The success of the square well model im-\nplies that diffusion is occurring at a much higher rate in the\nwell than in the barriers, allowing the well to retain a rela-\ntively square shape while dissolving the barriers. We have\ndemonstrated that the model used to fit the HRXRD data is\nalso consistent with the photoluminescence data.\nEXPERIMENTAL METHOD\nA SQW InGaAs\/GaAs specimen was grown by molecu-\nlar beam epitaxy. A GaAs buffer layer was first grown on a\nGaAs substrate, followed by a nominal 10 nm In0.2Ga0.8As\nwell layer and finally a 100 nm GaAs barrier. HRXRD mea-\nsurements of the sample gave a thickness of 9.8 nm and a\nconcentration of indium in the well was 19.2%. The wafer\nwas then capped with a 50 nm silicon nitride layer deposited\nby plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition to prevent\nsurface decomposition during annealing. A 537 mm speci-\nmen cut from the wafer was then repeatedly annealed at\n800 \u00b0C in helium ambient in a triple graphite strip rapid\nthermal annealer (rta) equipped with an Accufiber opticala)Electronic mail: w.gillin@qmul.ac.uk\nJOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS 97, 013536 (2005)\n0021-8979\/2005\/97(1)\/013536\/4\/$22.50 \u00a9 2005 American Institute of Physics97, 013536-1\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

The system is\ncalibrated against the melting point of silver and is consis-\ntently accurate to \u00b11 \u00b0C. A linear ramp time of 15 s was\nused to reach the anneal temperature.\nAfter each annealing step the photoluminescence energy\nand 004 HRXRD profiles of the specimen were measured.\nThe photoluminescence spectra were collected from the\nspecimen cooled to 80 K and excited with the 514.5 nm line\nof an argon ion laser. 004 HRXRD rocking curves were mea-\nsured at room temperature on a Philips material research dif-\nfractometer (MRD). The MRD had a highly collimated\nmonochromatic x-ray beam from the Cu Ka radiation pro-\nduced using the 220 reflections of a four-crystal Bartels ger-\nmanium monochromator. The Philips X\u2019PERT EPYTAXY 3.0\nsoftware allowed the calculation of rocking curves for vari-\nous virtual crystals made of layers of uniform composition\nusing the dynamical theory of x-ray scattering. Its compan-\nion software SMOOTHFIT, allowed the curve fitting of the ex-\nperimental measurements.\nRESULTS\nFigure 1 shows the 004 HRXRD rocking curves for the\nInGaAs\/GaAs sample following annealing at 800 \u00b0C for\nvarious times. The broad peak, characteristic of the quantum\nwell layer, can be seen migrating toward the substrate peak\nand getting thinner with increasing annealing time. It indi-\ncates that, as expected, with the diffusion of indium, the\nstrain in the quantum well layer decreases and the well itself\nbroadens. The small Pendell\u00f6sung fringes visible around the\nsubstrate peak are characteristic of the decoupling introduced\nby the quantum layer between the x-ray coherent reflections\nfrom the GaAs substrate\/buffer layer and the top barrier\nlayer. The periodicity of the fringes is related to the thickness\nof the top GaAs barrier layer.\nSome diffusion profiles of indium were calculated for\nvarious diffusion lengths by assuming a Fickian diffusion\nwith a constant diffusion coefficient and using the error func-\ntion approach. The Philips X\u2019PERT EPITAXY 3.0 software could\nthen simulate the corresponding 004 rocking curves. Figure 2\ndisplays the experimental rocking curve for the specimen\nannealed 2400 s at 800 \u00b0C and superimposed the simulated\nFickian profiles for diffusion lengths of 5 and 6 nm, the latter\nhaving a calculated photoluminescence peak shift very close\nto the experimental value. These simulated rocking curves\nbound the front of the quantum well peak between ,\u22121000\nand ,\u22122000 arcsec and, clearly, the experimental curve\nclearly cannot be fitted with the error function profiles. The\nexperimental data is sharper with a second feature at ,\n\u22124200 arcsec. A much closer fit is obtained with a purely\nsquare model, as seen in Fig. 2 with the translated rocking\ncurve simulation. This fitting profile was generated by simu-\nlating a 14.5 nm homogeneous square well containing\n12.90% indium buried under a GaAs barrier. It is an extreme\napproximation of a situation where diffusion in the well layer\noccurs at a much higher rate than in the barriers, the latter\nbeing effectively dissolved by a well that retains a square\nshape and homogeneous composition.\nEach experimental rocking curve was fitted using the\nSMOOTHFIT software with a homogeneous square well profile\nby leaving the well width and composition as free fitting\nparameters. Figure 3 shows several fits at different stages of\nannealing. The total amount of simulated indium remained\nconsistently close to the value deduced from fitting the unan-\nnealed specimen HRXRD rocking curve. A comparison of\nthe total indium (the thickness concentration product) in the\nunannealed well and each of the annealed wells shows a\nmaximum variation of ,1%.\nThe photoluminescence energies of the square well\nsimulations were then calculated and compared to the experi-\nmental measurements. Figure 4 shows a very good agree-\nment between calculated and experimental values of the pho-\ntoluminescence shift with In\/Ga interdiffusion. The\ncalculated photoluminescence energies were slightly larger\nthan the experimental data with a systematic error of about\n15 meV. This is a relatively small value and the fact that it is\na systematic error suggests that it could be accounted for by\nthe exciton binding energy, the temperature at which the em-\nFIG. 1.

Figure 5 refers to the Fickian model with a\nconstant coefficient of diffusion. Figure 6 is the square well\nmodel in which the well dissolves the barriers, retains a\nsquare shape, and a homogeneous composition with diffu-\nsion. The diffusion length is defined as half the total well\nwidth increase, and the well composition is calculated by a\nsimple conservation of matter with\nInW =\nIn0 3 w0\nw\n,\nwhere InW is the concentration of indium in a diffused well\nof width w, and In0, w0 are the indium concentration and\nwidth of the undiffused well.\nThe occurrence of a quantum well thickness fringe in the\nexperimental profile displayed in Fig. 2 is strong evidence\nthat the well is retaining a square shape even after a long\nannealing time. As an approximation, the rocking curve mea-\nsured in reciprocal space is a Fourier transform of the speci-\nmen structure in real space. A progressive loss of abruptness\nbetween the heterogeneous layers of the specimen would\nrender the higher order terms in a Fourier series negligible,\nwhich would be observed as an attenuation of higher order\nfringes in the rocking curve. The origin of Pendell\u00f6sung\nfringes generated by a family of diffracting planes is never-\ntheless more complex than for equal thickness fringes ob-\nFIG. 3.

It makes direct interpretation of rocking curves\ndifficult. For example, for long x-ray coherence length, dif-\nfraction for small layers and the substrate cannot be treated\nindependently of each other. A direct result of this, is that a\nthin layer peak neighboring the intense substrate peak is dis-\ntorted and displaced. For this reason, the modeling of the\nrocking curve by a dedicated software using the generally\naccurate dynamical calculation for x-ray scattering is cur-\nrently the most reliable method to extract structural\ninformation.8 Fringes are not visible in the case of graded\ninterfaces and cannot be seen in the simulated rocking curves\ncalculated with the Fickian model (Fig. 2). The square well\nhypothesis is successful in modeling the experimental\nHRXRD rocking curves and the experimental photolumines-\ncence peak shift with diffusion. Furthermore, the distribution\nof compositions calculated with error functions is in clear\ndisagreement in Fig. 2 with our experimental HRXRD mea-\nsurements.\nFrom these results, it is obvious that it cannot be as-\nsumed that a Fickian model with a constant coefficient of\ndiffusion will provide meaningful information for diffusion\nexperiments in the InGaAs\/GaAs system. A closer look at\nFigs. 5 and 6 shows that fitting experimental data with either\nmodel can yield very different or even contradictory answers\nto a problem. An example is experiments investigating pos-\nsible vacancy injection or destruction in some layers of a\nheterostructure by monitoring the photoluminescence peak\nshift of diffusing wells of different widths that have been\ngrown at various depths in a specimen. The apparent depen-\ndence of the diffusion rates with wells depth has often been\nconcomitant with the broader wells diffusing faster, as seen\nin Refs. 10 and 11, for example. This is certainly an artifact\nresulting from using a wrong model to fit experimental data.\nUsing the Fickian assumption with a constant coefficient of\ndiffusion to model experimental data of various experiments\nconducted in our group consistently yields the apparent re-\nsults of broader wells of identical compositions diffusing\nfaster under identical annealing conditions. A trend with well\ncomposition in the InGaAs\/GaAs system is also noticed.\nCONCLUSIONS\nHRXRD is a powerful tool that can provide accurate\ninformation on the composition distribution of small diffused\nquantum wells. The method is sensitive enough to conclude\nthat in our experiments, for the InGaAs\/GaAs system, inter-\ndiffusion under the effect of annealing cannot be assumed to\nbe following Fick\u2019s laws with a constant coefficient of diffu-\nsion, and that the modeling of diffused composition profiles\nwith error functions is wrong. InGaAs\/GaAs is a simple sys-\ntem in which there is no miscibility gap and indium simply\ninterdiffused with gallium. The failure of the above model\nfor this system therefore implies that methods of quantifying\ndiffusion in other semiconductor structures that rely solely\non measuring the photoluminescence peak shift can lead to\nerroneous conclusions.\n1L.
