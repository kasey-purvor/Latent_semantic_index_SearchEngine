The\nreview below gives an outline of some of his research interests and his substantial\ncontributions to learning technology. In the last issue, as an experiment, we invited\ncomments on the paper by Davies and Denning. The idea behind this was to try and\nencourage more discussion around papers and to look at introducing a more interactive\nelement to the journal. We will postpone this now until the next issue. If you would like to\ncontribute to this debate, please email comments to g.conole@bristol.ac.uk by Friday, 14\nDecember. Finally, I would like to welcome Dr Jane Seale and Dr Martin Oliver to the\neditorial team. Jane is based at King's College, London and is also editor for ALT-N.\nMartin is based at University College, London and has extensive editorial experience. I am\nlooking forward to working with them both over the next few years.\nDavid Squires, 1948-2001\nProfessor David Squires took over as editor of ALT-J in 1999. His recent tragic death is a\ntrue loss to learning technology.\nDavid's career spanned the educational spectrum. In the UK, he was one of the original\npioneers in work on considering how computers could be used to enhance learning. He\nbegan his career as a physics teacher and was based for one year at the Latymer School in\nEnfield. He moved in the late 1970s into an advisory role and was Adviser for Computers\nin Education for Devon Local Education Authority in the early 1980s. He went on to\nbecome Director of Sciences for the seminal project 'Computers in the Curriculum' (one of\nthe three major posts on the project) based at King's College. This was one of the first\nmajor computers-in-education initiatives in the country. At about the same time he also\ntook up a post at King's as a Lecturer in Educational Computing within the School of\nEducation. He remained at King's and was promoted to Senior Lecturer in 1994 and then\nto a chair in 2000.\n2\nALT-J Volume 9 Number 3\nHis research history shows a commitment over twenty years to scholarly work in the use of\nmultimedia and information and communication technologies (ICT), in educational\nsettings at both university and school level. Particular interests included theories of\nlearning and the design and evaluation of the use of multimedia and ICT in educational\nsettings, and the use of ICT in academic research. His research was strongly linked to\ncurriculum development through the design of multimedia learning materials for use in\nhigher education and schools.\nA major, thrust of his research was to articulate a theoretical rationale for the design and\nuse of educational multimedia. This work featured a synthesis of ideas from a range of\ndisciplines (software design, human-computer interaction, cognitive development and\ntheories of learning, curriculum theory and pedagogical practice) with the aim of\nidentifying synergies between these ideas at a theoretical level, to inform design and\nevaluation. In 1994 he co-authored a book which addressed the multi-faceted nature of the\nuse of multimedia in teaching and learning, and proposed a paradigm for educational\nsoftware evaluation, which he took broadly to include theoretically grounded analyses of\nvalidity and practice-orientated assessments of function. The contribution to theory made\nby his work was much praised. For example, the following editorial appeared in the Journal\nof Information Technology for Teacher Education:\nMany papers in this international journal discuss and develop concepts in relation to the\nprofessional development of teachers. In particular, the journal considers the\nprofessional development required by beginning and practising teachers in order to be\nable to use IT to encourage learning, to use IT to teach with and to manage the\napplication of IT in the learning environment. It was therefore with delight that we\nreceived a paper which provided a clear framework. Anne McDougall and David\nSquires's paper provides the keystone to this issue of the journal and this editorial. The\nframework's title is 'Perspectives Interactions Paradigm'. Within it are five commonly\nobserved foci for teacher professional development [... ]. I think that many in the field\nhave already written about aspects of these foci, but this may be the first time they have\nbeen brought together in a clear framework and I suspect that it may apply well beyond\nIT to any innovation in education. (Davis, 1997)\nHe was also particularly interested in the relationship between human computer\ninteraction and teaching and learning: the use of direct manipulation educational software.\nwas the focus of his Ph.D. thesis. In December 1996 he hosted a British Computer Society\nHuman Computer Interaction Special Interest Group meeting on 'Usability and\nEducational Software Design'. He also undertook a research fellowship with BT in 1999\non the design of an interface to a Web-based teachers' toolkit for open and distance\nlearning.\nAnother strand to his research was an exploration of the use of ICT in academic research,\nwhich included longitudinal analyses and case studies of the use of ICT by academics.\nFrom its inception this work was at the cutting edge: notably the use of state of the art ICT\ntools, including on-line bibliographic sources, networked CD-ROMs, bibliographic\nmanagement software, Web browsers, email and pre-print bulletin boards.\nMethodologies for researching the use of ICT in a research context were ill formed in 1992,\nand the work David directed at King's has been acknowledged as making a significant\n3\nEditorial\ncontribution to this area. His research highlighted that many assumptions about how ICT\nis used in research have been shown to be simplistic; for example, beliefs that user support\ncan be primarily reactive to users' needs rather than proactive in setting an agenda for user\nsupport. These findings have contributed to our understanding of the complex interactions\nthat characterize the use of ICT in a research context.\nMuch of his experience of applying ICT in higher education was gained in a European\ncontext. He was a member of the 'AQUA' TEMPUS project based on a collaboration\nbetween King's College, the Institute for Science Education, Kiel and the University of\nHradec in the Czech Republic. This project aimed to develop the use of ICT in\nenvironmental education, with an emphasis on establishing quality-assurance procedures\nfor curriculum development. During the period 1994-7 he was a managing partner of the\n'SITE' TEMPUS project principally involving collaboration with German and Bulgarian\npartners. This project focused on educational multimedia development, the analysis of\nsatellite images using state-of-the-art software applications, and the development of\ninternationally accredited masters degree programmes in ICT and Environmental Studies.\nPrior to this, from 1991 to 1994, he was a managing partner for the 'COBES' TEMPUS\nproject, which aimed to revise the Environmental Studies curriculum offered to engineer-\ning students at the Technical University in Sofia.\nThis outline of some of David's key research interests only touches on the range and\nbreadth of his work. In addition, he was an active member of the University and the higher\neducation community, serving on innumerable committees, steering groups and advisory\nboards, as well as undertaking significant undergraduate and postgraduate teaching and\nresearch supervision. He will be sadly missed, by me personally and by everyone else who\nwas fortunate enough to have worked with him.\nGr\u00e1inne Conole\nEditor\nReference\nDavis, N.
