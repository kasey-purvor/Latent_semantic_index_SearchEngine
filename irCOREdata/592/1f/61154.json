Introduction\nThe energetic electron flux (E > 100 keV) in the Earth\u2019s outer radiation belt (3 < L <5\n7) can vary by up to five orders of magnitude [Baker and Kanekal, 2007] on timescales6\nof hours to weeks due to competing acceleration, transport, and loss processes. Under-7\nstanding and specifying this variability is important because enhanced fluxes of energetic8\nelectrons damage satellites [Wrenn et al., 2002] and are a hazard for astronauts.9\nTransport of relativistic (\u223c MeV) electrons within the radiation belts is dominated10\nby radial diffusion. However, quantifying electron loss and acceleration due to resonant11\ninteractions with plasma waves is essential for the development of dynamic radiation12\nbelt models. Losses due to whistler mode waves, known as plasmaspheric hiss, have13\nbeen included into transport models [Beutier and Boscher, 1995; Boudarie et al., 1997;14\nBrautigam and Albert, 2000; Shprits et al., 2005], as well as acceleration and loss due to15\nwhistler mode chorus [Horne et al., 2006] with various degrees of success.16\nInside the high density plasmasphere previous studies have represented loss due to17\nplasmaspheric hiss by a parameterized loss timescale [Shprits and Thorne, 2004; Shprits18\net al., 2005]. Here, we present a model that incorporates radial transport with energy19\ndependent loss due to plasmaspheric hiss. We use a statistical model based on CRRES20\ndata for the observed wave intensity and the ratio of the electron plasma to electron gyro21\nfrequency fpe\/fce, as a function of geomagnetic activity (Kp index) with resolution in L22\nshell and magnetic local time (MLT) [Meredith et al., 2004]. As a result, no plasmapause23\nmodel is required, losses due to hiss within high density plumes are included, and flux24\nvariations at 976 keV are reproduced with increasingly good agreement with data as L25\ndecreases.26\n2. Modeling Radial Diffusion with Losses\nTheory shows that gradients in electron phase space density f are reduced by radial\ndiffusion across the magnetic field driven by global scale fluctuations in the Earth\u2019s mag-\nD R A F T September 18, 2007, 9:18am D R A F T\n4 LAM ET AL. : PLASMASPHERIC HISS LOSSES\nnetic and electric fields. Radial diffusion is enhanced when ULF waves are present [e.g.,\nElkington et al., 1999] at frequencies comparable to the electron drift frequency around\nthe Earth (\u223c few mHz at 1 MeV). Since the drift frequency is much lower than the fre-\nquencies associated with the bounce (\u223c Hz) and gyro (\u223c kHz) motion of electrons the\nfirst two adiabatic invariants, \u00b5 and (Kaufmann) K, are conserved. The first invariant is\ngiven by\n\u00b5 = p2sin2\u03b1\/(2m0B) (1)\nwhere p is the relativistic electron momentum, m0 is electron rest mass, B is the magnitude\nof the Earth\u2019s ambient magnetic field and \u03b1 is the electron\u2019s pitch angle. The invariance of\n\u00b5 means that electrons transported towards (away from) the Earth due to radial diffusion\nare accelerated (decelerated). The evolution of f at constant \u00b5 and J is given by [Schultz\nand Lanzerotti, 1974]\n\u2202f\n\u2202t\n= L2\n\u2202\n\u2202L\n[\nDLLL\n\u22122 \u2202f\n\u2202L\n]\n\u2212 f\n\u03c4\n(2)\nwhere the first term on the right-hand-side is due to radial diffusion (DLL is the radial\ndiffusion coefficient) and the second term is due to losses (where \u03c4 is the electron lifetime).\nHere local acceleration due to gyro-resonant wave particle interactions is not included. A\ndipole magnetic field is used for all calculations. The radial diffusion coefficient used here is\ndue to electromagnetic fluctuations, which dominate that due to electrostatic fluctuations\n[Brautigam and Albert, 2000], and is given by\nDLL = D\nM\nLL = 10\n0.506Kp\u22129.325L10 (3)\nfor Kp = 1 to 6. Radial diffusion is strongly enhanced for large Kp, corresponding to27\ngeomagnetic storm periods, particularly at high values of L. Equation 2 is solved using a28\nfully-implicit numerical method with a conservative differencing scheme and spatial and29\ntemporal grid resolutions of \u03b4L = 0.1L and \u03b4t = 0.05135 days. During the short periods30\nthat Kp > 6, DLL is calculated for Kp = 6. The model was run initially to attain a steady31\nD R A F T September 18, 2007, 9:18am D R A F T\nLAM ET AL. : PLASMASPHERIC HISS LOSSES 5\nstate for Kp = 3 with an inner boundary condition f(L = 3) = 0, and outer boundary32\ncondition described below.33\n3. Lifetimes due to Plasmaspheric Hiss\nThe electron loss timescale due to plasmaspheric hiss can be derived from the bounce34\naveraged pitch angle diffusion rate \u3008D\u03b1\u03b1\u3009\/p2 averaged over the drift orbit of the electrons35\naround the Earth. Pitch angle diffusion rates depend on several factors, including the wave36\npower, magnetic field strength (and hence L), fpe\/fce, and the frequency and propagation37\ndirection of the waves. The loss timescale for \u223c 1 MeV electrons due to plasmaspheric hiss38\nis of the order of a few days [Meredith et al., 2006, 2007], much longer than the timescale39\nfor electron drift around the Earth, which is about 15 minutes. Since wave power, fpe\/fce40\nand other plasma conditions vary considerably in magnetic local time (MLT), and with41\nmagnetic activity, these variations must be taken into account. We use two statistical42\nmodels comprising data from the CRRES plasma wave experiment [Anderson et al., 1992],43\none for the wave intensity B2W and the other for fpe\/fce, for three different levels of44\nmagnetic activity as measured by Kp (similar to Meredith et al. [2004] but binned in Kp45\nrather than AE).46\nThe wave intensity of plasmaspheric hiss, and fpe\/fce, were determined from CRRES47\ndata and sorted into a database with a resolution of 0.1L, and 1 hour MLT for Kp < 2,48\n2 \u2264 Kp < 4, and Kp \u2265 4. Since whistler-mode chorus and fast magnetosonic waves49\ncan also occur in the hiss frequency range 0.1 \u2212 5 kHz they were excluded from the50\ndata [Meredith et al., 2004, 2007]. Figure 1a shows plasmaspheric hiss wave intensity51\nas a function of L for the three Kp categories. Wave intensity has been averaged over52\n5\u25e6 \u2264 \u03bbm \u2264 30\u25e6 and 24 hours of MLT. Hiss intensity increases with Kp, particularly for53\nL > 4, even though the high density plasmapause is known to be eroded to lower L,54\nduring high geomagnetic activity. At large L the increase in intensity is mainly restricted55\nto the noon-afternoon MLT sector, resulting in the MLT-mean hiss intensity at L = 656\nD R A F T September 18, 2007, 9:18am D R A F T\n6 LAM ET AL. : PLASMASPHERIC HISS LOSSES\nbeing higher for 2 \u2264 Kp < 4 than for Kp \u2265 4. We attribute the increase to the occurrence57\nof hiss inside high density plumes [e.g. Meredith et al., 2004] which can extend to large L58\non the dayside during geomagnetic storms and substorms [Moldwin et al., 2004; Goldstein59\net al., 2004]. Thus hiss at large L, which may be important for electron loss to the60\natmosphere, is included in our model.61\nPitch angle diffusion rates depend on the distribution of wave power in frequency and62\nwave normal angle and were computed using the PADIE code (Pitch Angle and energy63\nDiffusion of Ions and Electrons) [Glauert and Horne, 2005]. PADIE assumes a Gaussian64\ndistribution in wave power and X = tan\u03c8 where \u03c8 is the wave normal angle. Following65\nMeredith et al. [2006], typical properties for plasmaspheric hiss were used including a66\npeak intensity at 550 Hz, a bandwidth of 300 Hz, and lower and upper cut-off frequencies67\nof 0.1 and 2 kHz. Comparison between observed and model loss timescales during quiet68\ntimes suggest that electron loss is caused by hiss propagating at small to intermediate69\nwave normal angles (0\u25e6 \u2264 \u03c8 \u2264 50\u25e6), and that the sensitivity to wave normal angle in70\nthis range is low [Meredith et al., 2004, 2006]. Therefore a Gaussian distribution in X71\npeaked along the magnetic field direction with an angular spread of Xw = tan 20\n\u25e6 was72\nused. Landau and \u00b110 cyclotron harmonic resonances were included in the calculations.73\nInteractions between waves and electrons at higher latitudes were taken into account74\nby bounce averaging the diffusion rates between the mirror points, assuming the wave75\npower remains constant and using a constant plasma density and dipole magnetic field. A76\nnominal wave intensity of 900 pT2 was used, subsequently scaled according to observations77\nin the wave database.78\nSince pitch angle diffusion rates depend on fpe\/fce [Horne et al., 2003] PADIE was used79\nto calculate a matrix of diffusion coefficients as a function of pitch angle at L = 3, 4, 5, and80\n6, at fpe\/fce = 2, 6, 10, 14, and 18, and energies of 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000,81\nand 5000 keV which encompass observations. As electrons drift around the Earth they82\nencounter different wave and plasma conditions which change the rate of diffusion. We take83\nD R A F T September 18, 2007, 9:18am D R A F T\nLAM ET AL. : PLASMASPHERIC HISS LOSSES 7\naccount of this global variability in our model. For a given Kp our statistical wave models84\nspecify the spatial distribution of wave intensity and fpe\/fce. The bounce-averaged pitch85\nangle diffusion rates were interpolated from the diffusion matrix to the value of fpe\/fce,86\nL and electron energy, scaled by the wave power in each MLT bin, and averaged over 2487\nhours to obtain the bounce and drift averaged diffusion rates. The precipitation lifetime \u03c488\nwas then obtained by numerically solving the 1d pitch-angle diffusion equation, assuming89\nthat the electron distribution function can be separated into a pitch-angle dependent90\nfunction and a time-dependent function F (t), given by [Lyons et al, 1972, Albert, 1994]91\n\u03c4 =\n\u2212F\ndF\/dt\n(4)\nThis was done between L = 3 and 6 at a resolution of 0.5L, at the three levels of Kp and92\nthe 9 energy levels and kept in a lookup table for use in the model. Electron lifetimes are93\nshown in Figure 1b for a constant energy of E = 976 keV. At L < 3.5, electron lifetimes94\nonly show a small reduction with increasing Kp from about 2.5 days to 1 day. However,95\nfor 3.5 < L < 6 electron lifetimes are more dramatically reduced with increasing magnetic96\nactivity, indicating the importance of hiss inside high density plumes.97\nAt L = 6 the global electron lifetime is less for 2 \u2264 Kp < 4 than for Kp \u2265 4. This98\nis due to two factors: firstly fpe\/fce at L = 6 tends to be higher for high geomagnetic99\nactivity than for moderate activity [Meredith et al., 2004] and electron lifetimes calculated100\nby PADIE increase with increasing fpe\/fce. Secondly, hiss intensity is greater at moderate101\nactivity than at high magnetic activity (Figure 1a).102\n4. Outer Boundary Conditions\nSince the \u223c 1 MeV electron flux at geostationary orbit can vary by several orders of103\nmagnitude, a time-dependent outer boundary is used for the radial diffusion model with104\nlosses. Equation (2) is solved for multiple values of \u00b5 to obtain results at 976 keV for105\nD R A F T September 18, 2007, 9:18am D R A F T\n8 LAM ET AL. : PLASMASPHERIC HISS LOSSES\n3 \u2264 L \u2264 7 with a resolution of 0.1L , so the model requires the flux at different energies106\nat the outer boundary at L = 7.107\nCombined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite (CRRES) Medium Electrons A108\n(MEA) observations [Vampola et al., 1992] show that the electron flux often decreases109\nduring the main phase of a storm at \u223c 1 MeV (e.g., Figure 2b, red line) whereas at 153110\nkeV (blue line) there may be no significant decrease, or even an increase during the storm111\nmain phase (e.g. storms 1-4 in Figure 2a). Thus simply scaling the electron flux at one112\nenergy to all energies for the outer boundary condition is not sufficient.113\nBrautigam and Albert [2000] found that coverage of phase space density in \u00b5 and K114\nis very limited in the CRRES data set at L\u2217 > 6. For their outer boundary condition115\nthey developed a method of using geosynchronous data. We use a similar method. Since116\nCRRES MEA data at L = 7 has poor time resolution due to orbit constraints, we use117\ndata from L = 6 which has a much better time resolution (\u223c 5 hours) and apply this to118\nthe outer boundary at L = 7 as described below. The variability of the electron flux at119\neach of the 17 MEA energy channels (153-1582 keV) at L = 6 was calculated by the ratio120\nR(E, t) =\nJ(E, t)\nJq(L = 6)\n(5)\nwhere J(E, t) is the measured flux at L = 6 and Jq(L = 6) is the average flux at L = 6121\nmeasured on quiet day 281, 1990. The flux at the outer boundary (L = 7) was then found122\nby multiplying R by the average quiet-time electron energy spectrum at L = 7, Jq(L = 7),123\nas done by Shprits and Thorne [2004]. In their paper Jq(L = 7) = 8222.6 exp(\u22127.068W )124\n(cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 keV\u22121) where W is the electron energy in MeV. The temporal variation125\nat a required energy was found by interpolation. Although variations faster than a few126\nhours are not captured in the model (Figure 2b), long duration magnetic storms should127\nbe reproduced.128\nD R A F T September 18, 2007, 9:18am D R A F T\nLAM ET AL. : PLASMASPHERIC HISS LOSSES 9\n5. Electron flux variability\nThe models for wave intensity and fpe\/fce are for the range 5\n\u25e6 \u2264 \u03bbm \u2264 30\u25e6 MLT.129\nIn addition, the radial diffusion coefficients were determined for the equator. To test130\nour model against observations we therefore simulate the 90\u25e6 pitch angle electron flux131\nmeasured by the CRRES MEA experiment (Figure 3). A time sequence of Kp (Figure 3g)132\nwas used to drive the model for a period of \u223c 150 days starting from 30 July 1990,133\ncorresponding to day of year (DOY) 211.134\nAt L = 3.5, the observed electron flux increases by up to three orders of magnitude when135\ngeomagnetic activity is high (Figure 3e, green), for instance, at the onsets of storms 1, 3136\nand 4. Exponential decay follows such increases during quieter periods (e.g. DOY 235-137\n258, DOY 285-330, DOY 332-350). The model decay rate at L = 3.5 is in remarkably good138\nagreement with observations showing that the observed quiet-time exponential decays are139\ndue to pitch-angle scattering caused by the interaction of the electrons with plasmaspheric140\nhiss. After the onsets of storms 3 and 4, the model flux at L = 3.5 starts to decrease141\nwhen the measured flux is still increasing, contributing to the order of magnitude difference142\nbetween model and observations. Possible causes for the difference between model results143\nand data include an insufficient resolution in Kp in the statistical wave model, insufficient144\nresolution in time or energy in the data used to derive the outer boundary condition, and145\nthe lack of local acceleration processes in the model.146\nAt L = 5 (Figure 3c), the model flux tends to increase and decrease at times when147\nthere are significant variations in the observed flux, but underestimates the size of the148\nvariability. There is also a lot of variability in the data which is not reproduced in the149\nmodel, although the peak to peak variability in the data is smaller than at L = 3.5. This150\nmay seem surprising since L = 5 is closer to the outer boundary. However, the model151\nreflects variability in the outer boundary. If variations in the outer boundary are relatively152\nsmall, and last for periods short compared with the time for diffusion from L = 7 to L = 5153\nthen the flux at L = 5 will be smoother than that at L = 7. Therefore at least some154\nD R A F T September 18, 2007, 9:18am D R A F T\n10 LAM ET AL. : PLASMASPHERIC HISS LOSSES\nof the observed variability at L = 5 is probably due to another local process as opposed155\nto inward radial diffusion. L = 5 also lies mostly outside the plasmasphere during more156\ndisturbed times (the dotted line in Figures 3a and b is an idealized plasmapause from157\nCarpenter and Anderson [1992]) and hiss losses are smaller than at lower L.158\nIn a similar study Shprits et al. [2005] used a constant outer boundary, and an empirical159\nelectron lifetime of 3\/Kp outside the plasmapause and 10 days within the plasmapause.160\nTheir simple parameterization, however, is only applicable at 1 MeV. Our lifetimes are161\nbased on more careful analysis of the data and are well below 10 days when Kp \u2265 2162\nand even for Kp < 2 when L \u2264 4 (Figure 1b). While Shprits et al. [2005] reproduce163\nthe variability outside the plasmapause, our model should provide a better representation164\ninside the plasmapause.165\n6. Concluding remarks\nOur model does remarkably well at reproducing flux decay rates at L = 3.5 and 4166\nand simulates the flux to within an order of magnitude. This raises the question of the167\nimportance of electron acceleration due to wave-particle interactions, for instance, from168\nwhistler mode chorus. Chen et al. [2007] found frequent and persistent peaks in phase169\nspace density around L\u2217 = 5.5 which they suggest is compelling evidence for gyro-resonant170\nwave acceleration. The boundary condition for our model is derived from CRRES MEA171\ndata at L = 6 which is at a similar location. Thus some of the variability due to local172\nwave acceleration processes is included in the model via the boundary conditions, which173\nmay explain why the model performs so well. However, acceleration and losses due to174\nother wave modes are also likely to be important, and more complex models are required175\nto fully understand their role in radiation belt dynamics.176\nDuring magnetic storms the plasmasphere becomes eroded and asymmetric in MLT.177\nHigh density plumes develop and extend towards the magnetopause mainly in the post178\nnoon MLT sector. Plumes can contain intense plasmaspheric hiss emissions [e.g., Summers179\nD R A F T September 18, 2007, 9:18am D R A F T\nLAM ET AL. : PLASMASPHERIC HISS LOSSES 11\net al., 2007]. Our model includes the effects of hiss in plumes without the need to define180\na complicated plasmapause structure in MLT. The results show that even though plumes181\nmay be confined in MLT, losses due to hiss within plumes can have a significant effect on182\nthe electron lifetimes even out to L = 6 during magnetically active conditions, and must183\nbe included in any physics-based model.184\nThe results show that it is possible to model variations in the outer radiation belt using185\nphysics-based models provided time and energy-dependent outer boundary conditions are186\nused. While satellites such as GOES at geosynchronous orbit measure the relativistic187\nelectron flux, additional observations at lower energies (\u223c 50 keV) are required to model188\nthe radiation environment for GPS, Galileo, and lower satellite orbits.189\nAcknowledgments.
