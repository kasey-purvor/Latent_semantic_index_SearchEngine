His assassination, carried out without apparent specific motive but certainly linked \nto his activities as a human rights advocate, was condemned in the strongest terms, and \nhis loss widely mourned. Over ten thousand mourners processed through Johannesburg\u2019s \nstreets at his funeral (Spiegel and Kadalie 1989).  The obituaries published in a variety of \nacademic journals (Hammond-Tooke 1989; Spiegel and Kadalie 1989; E Webster 1989; \nKlugman 1989) were however relatively low-key and subdued compared to the \noutpourings of grief, outrage and anger which his death occasioned in the wider world. It \nwas beyond the university community, and in particular in the arena of anti-apartheid \nactivism, that Webster appeared to have made his most significant mark. \n  \nTwenty years on it is worth reassessing the balance between the political and the \nanthropological work of this intriguing and somewhat contradictory figure. To do so now \nis apposite not only because of the anniversary of his untimely death, but also because a \nvolume based on his PhD thesis is to be published this year, translated into Portuguese, in \na volume edited by Joao de Pina Cabral (Webster 2009). But the fact that it has taken 32 \nyears to bring the document to the attention of the wider world and especially to the \nLusophone community, and that it is has taken two decades since his death to publish any \nbook by him at all, points to a number of anomalies. Contradictions in South Africa\u2019s \nturbulent passage to democracy, in the relationship between South Africa and its \nneighbours in the region \u2013 especially the one situated just to the north-east, Mozambique \n- and in the changing character of anthropological scholarship in that country, have all \nconspired to stall the publication of this book. There have also been contradictory \ntendencies in the life and work of its author, and personal tensions experienced by a man \ntorn between dedication to the profession of anthropologist and commitment to a struggle \nagainst a brutal and unlawful regime. It is perhaps true to say that these tensions were \nnever fully resolved. Had they been, and had David Webster survived, he might \neventually have achieved the standing of a public intellectual in the fullest sense of the \nword. But the efforts he made are no less praiseworthy for all that. \n \nIf, by the time of David\u2019s assassination in 1989, he was better known for his political \nactivism, and for his written interventions which were offered as testimony against the \ninequities produced by the apartheid system (1981b, 1982b, 1983a and b, 1984a, 1989) \nthan for his academic writings, this was not because the latter were insubstantial. And \nthey too encompass a startling range, from anthropological articles on Chopi and Tembe \nThonga kinship terminology, marriage strategy and domestic life on the one hand (1973, \n1977, 1981a, 1986a, 1991) to writings on proletarianisation, capital and class (1976, \n1978, 1983a); nutrition and disease (1986c) and the unemployment crisis in Soweto \n(1982a, 1983b, 1984b) on the other. This surprising juxtaposition is explained in part by a \nsudden switch in anthropology\u2019s theoretical trajectory: a switch experienced with \nparticular force by left-leaning and radical academics in South Africa. It is also explained \nby David\u2019s own personal trajectory which took him step-by-step into political activism. \nBut it did not do so along a predetermined path.  \n \nThe backdrop of David's childhood, adolescence, student days and research field \n\u2018spanned four different countries in southern Africa in different phases of  \ndecolonialisation\u2019 (Glenda Webster, personal communication).  It is likely that all of \nthese contributed in some way to making him an anthropologist with a commitment to \npolitical activism in South Africa. But they did not do so in any preordained manner. \nSome accounts, written in somewhat heroic vein to celebrate his role in fighting \u2018for our \nfreedom\u2019 (Frederikse 1998) or to commemorate him as a \u2018campaigner for human rights\u2019 \n(Klugman 1989; see also E Webster 1989), interpret David\u2019s early life through the prism \nof his later activism. They represent his family as members of the white working class, \nwho left Roodepoort in South Africa to settle in Luanshya, in what was then Northern \nRhodesia. David, born in 1945, is depicted as having inherited racist attitudes from his \nbackground and from his schooling at Falcon College boarding school in then Southern \nRhodesia, but as then having overcome these in the course of his undergraduate \nuniversity education \u2013 first in accountancy, later in anthropology \u2013 completed in 1967 at \nRhodes University. He is then shown as further transcending these attitudes, eventually to \nbecome the militant campaigner celebrated in all his obituaries. But matters were \nconsiderably more nuanced than this suggests. \n \nIf David did indeed learn something of his activist humanism in the course of his studies \nas an anthropologist, it is probable that his initial experience of fieldwork among the \nChopi of the Inharrime district of southern Mozambique, in 1969, played no small part in \nthis process. His then wife Glenda Webster, who accompanied him, recalls being \nreceived as a clan member (she was a Mucumbi and David was a Nyakwaha), and being \ncontinually plied with produce: maize cobs grilled over small fires, peanuts or cashew \nnuts, chickens, venison and tea made with condensed milk (a highly valued commodity \nonly used on very special occasions). She recalls one occasion when the Websters were \npassing the home of someone who was in his hut shaving. \u2018When he heard the car he \ncame rushing out with shaving cream all over his face to wave at us.\u2019 The hospitality and \ngenerosity they experienced, says Glenda, justifies \u2018Vasco da Gama\u2019s description of this \npart of the east coast of Africa as \u2018terra de boa gente\u2019 - the land of the good people\u2019 \n(Glenda Webster, personal communication). \n \nSchooled in structural-functionalist anthropology, David Webster found this descent-\noriented approach inadequate to explain the variable and flexible character of Chopi \nsociety. He began instead to deploy frameworks of analysis derived from the scholars of \nthe Manchester school, with their emphasis on transaction and strategy. But shortly after \ngraduating with the PhD in 1975, and having started his first permanent lecturing job at \nthe University of the Witwatersrand, he was soon exposed to a far more radical \nalternative. Ironically, his first actual acquaintance with Manchester, when he and Glenda \ntraveled to the UK and he taught in the Department of Anthropology there for two \nconsecutive periods between 1976 and 1978, instead of increasing his interest in \ntransactionalist analysis, began to distance him from the theories and techniques of \nanthropology. Instead he was influenced by sociologists deploying Marxist theories, such \nas Peter Worsley, and by the work of social historians such as E P Thompson. Whether \nthis moment represented, for him, a permanent transgressing of the boundaries of \nmainstream anthropology, or a short-term preoccupation with new modes of analysis \nwhich could be successfully reunited with fieldwork and participant observation, is a \nmatter for debate. \n \nProfoundly influenced by an academic climate in which the experiences of the working \nclass and the impact of capitalism and industrialization were predominant, he returned to \nSouth Africa and to his lecturing job at the University of the Witwatersrand. His teaching, \nusing key works in the Marxist canon including some which were banned in South Africa \nat the time, informed - and reflected \u2013 increasingly radical South African trends, and his \npublications on the Chopi began to reflect similar concerns, expressing his growing \ninterest in their proletarianisation and incorporation into the ranks of the migrant labour \nforce working in South Africa\u2019s gold mines (1976, 1978). \n \nDavid\u2019s interests gradually switched away from the \u2018satellites\u2019 of migrant labour and \ntowards its South African \u2018metropolis\u2019, in particular the Witwatersrand, at whose \nuniversity he continued to teach. He began to produce a range of short, arguably more \njournalistic pieces primarily intended to demonstrate the inadequacies of the South \nAfrican apartheid system (1982b, 1983a and b), its health care (1983a) and nutrition \n(1981b). But he remained interested in Mozambique, where many ANC and SACP \nmembers, some in exile from South Africa, were living at the time. Both his connections \nin Mozambique and the radical nature of the transformation he underwent while living in \nthe UK have fuelled speculation that David might at some point have been recruited to \nthe ANC\u2019s armed wing Umkhonto we Sizwe or the ANC-allied South African Communist \nParty (SACP), or both. It was at around the time of his return to South Africa that SACP \nmember Ruth First, wife of Umkhonto we Sizwe commander Joe Slovo, wrote to him, \nexpressing interest in his piece on colonialism, underdevelopment and migrant labour in \nMozambique (1976), and requesting some help with sources for her own book on a \nsimilar topic, later published as Black Gold (1983). In her letter, she refers to an enquiry \nhe had made to her about the possibility of working at or liaising with Eduardo Mondlane \nUniversity, in Maputo: one which he did not eventually pursue.1 A matter which \nsimilarly points to his possible membership of Umkhonto was his later involvement in \nhelping party member H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Pastoors and her partner Klaas de Jonge, who fell foul of \nthe South African authorities. Pastoors, who had come to South Africa from Mozambique \nwhere she was living as a member of Umkhonto, was briefly employed as a fellow \nlecturer at the University of the Witwatersrand (Frederikse 1998). When she was later \ndetained David Webster offered help and support.  \n \nWhatever his formal party or institutional connections, which are a matter of speculation, \nthe character of his involvement as an activist within the country, and the extent to which \nhis activities became irksome to the South African authorities, are a matter of public \nrecord. It has never been fully established which of these activities led to the terrible \nevent of his assassination. But all of these activities appear to have caused extreme \ndispleasure: whether to criminal smuggling networks, the police, the border authorities, \nnature conservation officials, or more shadowy figures higher up the authority chain. His \ndeath has been blamed on his co-founding of and active involvement in an organization \ncalled the Detainees\u2019 Parents\u2019 Support Committee (DPSC), which provided advice and \nnurture to relatives of those detained without trial during the increasingly repressive years \nof the 1980s, and sent gifts to the detainees themselves. Police, apparently aggrieved at \nthe organisation\u2019s success in helping to boost the morale of those they were most keen to \ndiscourage, continually disrupted the regular \u2018tea parties\u2019 held by David and his \ncolleagues in the Committee, including Maggie Friedman, his then partner.2 His murder \nhas also been explained by reference to his having uncovered illegal smuggling routes for \narms or ivory between Natal and Mozambique while doing fieldwork in the late 1980s \n(Frederikse 1998).  Probably less significant in contributing to his death, but still showing \nhis tenacity and engagement, was David\u2019s opposition during the same period to the nature \nconservation officials of northern Natal, whom he suspected of hatching a plot to create a \ngiant nature reserve and - in the process \u2013 of resettling numerous villagers from their \n                                                 \n1 Letter to David Webster from Ruth First, 8 May 1977, box A6, A2792, Historical Papers Library, \nUniversity of the Witwatersrand. \n2 Mail and Guardian, 12-18th May 1989 \nhomes in the area.3 Whatever the source of official or less official displeasure, the true \nreasons for David\u2019s assassination by Ferdi Barnard, member of the clandestine and \nshadowy Civil Co-operation Bureau with tenuous links to official police structures, were \nnever fully revealed. Requests by the members of the David Webster Trust that his death \n\u2018should not be viewed as a free-standing case of an individual murder but rather as part of \na co-ordinated campaign\u2019,4 an eventual inquest in 1992, and sessions of the Truth and \nReconciliation Commission which were held in 1996 after the advent of democracy in \n1994, never revealed a chain of command. Barnard was eventually charged with murder \nand sentenced in 1997, but without implicating any holders of higher office in the \napartheid government of the time. \n \nBut although David\u2019s political activism appears to have overshadowed his academic \nactivities after the late 1970s, and although his death brought both to an untimely close, \nthere was a revival of his interest in academic fieldwork. Activism did not eclipse \nanthropology altogether. Tracing his work through the two major research projects \nconducted in this later period, one can discern a gradual progression. Starting from an \ninitial theoretical awkwardness, the work demonstrates a growing intellectual maturity: it \ncontains the promise that his activist concerns might eventually have dovetailed with \nresearch interests to produce a new synthesis.  \n \nIt was not, however, an easy road. The first project, a jointly-run study on the informal \nsector and unemployment in Soweto, made an attempt to reconceptualise \u2018informal \nsector\u2019 activities as \u2018petty commodity production\u2019 (1982a, 1983b, 1984b, 1986b) which \nwas rejected by some as having sacrificed ethnographic detail and empirical richness to \nan arid and abstract debate.  The work combined some of the influences he had picked up \nin Manchester with a tendency to pick over neo-Marxist categories that had become \nprevalent in South Africa by that time. In retrospect, these episodes of criticism, and the \ndefensive responses they prompted, can be seen as having manifested the kind of \n                                                 \n3 Ellis (1994); see also letter from David Webster, 8th July (probably 1980), to Dan, Pippa, Pam and Ross; \nbox A6, A2792, Historical Papers, William Cullen Library, University of the Witwatersrand. \n4 David Webster Trust, Memorandum, box A6, A2792, Historical Papers, William Cullen Library, \nUniversity of the Witwatersrand. \n \nfactional in-fighting that has often caused left-wing scholars and activists to find more \nfault with each other than they do with those to whom they are opposed. \n \nThe second of these projects, returning David to his earlier vocation as hands-on \nethnographic fieldworker in a rural setting, was more fruitful. From 1976, and with \nredoubled vigour after 1986, he spent time amongst the Tembe Thonga of northern \nZululand: a group whose territory and culture officially borders southern Mozambique \nbut in fact crosses that border. Here he continued his interest in migrant labour, \ncombining this with a focus on ethnicity, gender and household. In his articles from this \nperiod, particularly the one published posthumously in a tribute to Townsmen or \nTribesmen author Philip Mayer, his former lecturer and mentor at Rhodes University, he \nsuccessfully brings together subtle ethnographic analysis with theoretical perspectives \nfrom contemporary social science (1991). He sensitively deploys the concept of \n\u2018subculture\u2019, borrowed from Dick Hebdidge of the Birmingham Centre for Cultural \nStudies, to explain why Tembe Thonga women speak and dress as \u2018Thonga\u2019 while their \nhusbands and brothers self-identify as \u2018Zulu\u2019. By focusing on women\u2019s self-definition \nwithin the household, he offers an insightful challenge to what was becoming a \nhegemonic view among revisionist scholars: that ethnicity represents \u2018a form of popular \nmale resistance to the forces that were reshaping African lives throughout southern Africa\u2019 \n(Vail 1989:15). Here, matters of anthropological interest such as marriage, gender and the \ndomestic domain re-appear in his work, explained but not wholly determined by the \nbroader context of proletarian experience and labour migration (as Marxist scholars \nwould have thought appropriate), but allowing some agency to individual actors (as the \nManchester school might have proposed).  \n \nMight David have proceeded further along these lines to contribute further to the revival \nof anthropology in South Africa and\/or Mozambique? Or might he have taken up a key \nposition in ANC structures and\/or in the new government of South Africa, as did some \nother activist\/academics? If so, might he have become disillusioned by - or even been \nsidelined as a result of - the post-1999\/post-Mandela regime\u2019s gradual erosion of the \nANC\u2019s non-racial tradition? Perhaps, in turn, he would have come back to anthropology \nonce again, upholding traditions of criticism and debate, airing the grievances of common \npeople, and becoming a public intellectual in the true sense of the word. These are \nquestions about which his former friends, colleagues and students (I count myself as a \nmember of all three) often speculate. But all of these people, and many more besides, will \nbe heartened and delighted that this account of his original Chopi fieldwork is finally to \nbe published, and that an aspect of his work long overlooked will now become better \nknown. It seems particularly apposite that the work\u2019s publication in Portuguese will \ncontribute to the current strengthening and transnational interconnectedness of \nanthropology in the Lusophone world. \n \nDeborah James \nDept of Anthropology, London School of Economics \n \nReferences \n \nEllis, Steven 1994.
