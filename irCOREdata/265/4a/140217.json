In pluralistic organization forms, the assumption that board directors, through\ntraditional hierarchy, can ensure appropriate degrees of control over the managers of\ncapital seems increasingly problematic. An imposition of control that fails to take\naccount of diverse employees interests is of questionable ethical rigour, and certainly\nunlikely to be effective in encouraging responsible corporate behaviour. Building\nresponsible, moral organizational communities must therefore be concerned with\nreconfiguring hierarchy in a way that builds the voluntary commitment of employees\nto super-ordinate goals. Borrowed from political philosophy, this paper develops the\nidea of voluntarism as an organising principle that can further the development of\ncorporate responsibility by mediating between the demands for corporate control and\nefficiency and the need to respond to calls for greater inclusion.\nKey Words: hierarchy, voluntarism, leadership, organizational politics\nWord Count: 7970\nTrack: 2\n2Voluntarism as an organizing principle for \u2018responsible\norganizations\u2019.\nResponsible governance is as much to do with how organizations engage their\nhuman capital, as it is to do with the relationship between the owners and agents of\ncapital (Child, 2005, Child and Rodrigues, 2003). In today\u2019s highly plural organization,\n- where stakeholders hold a diversity of conceptions about organizational purpose,\norganising and intended outcomes (Huzzard and \u04e6stergren, 2002), - the assumption\nthat the board of directors, through traditional hierarchy, can ensure appropriate\ndegrees of control over the managers of capital seems increasingly problematic\n(Child, 2005). A one sided imposition of control that fails to take account of diverse\nemployees interests is at least of questionable ethical rigour, and certainly unlikely to\nbe effective in encouraging responsible corporate behaviour (Rousseau and Rivero,\n2003, Crane et al, 2004). Building responsible, moral organizational communities is\nthus intimately concerned with reconfiguring hierarchy in a way that builds the\nvoluntary commitment of employees to super-ordinate goals (Courpasson and Dany,\n2003).\nIn the context of contemporary hyper-competitive business environments, this issue\nis considered critical to effective organization (Child, 2005). In these conditions,\norganizational success may be as much the product of continual innovation as it is of\nefficiency (Child and McGrath, 2002). Such innovation is recognised as being\ninextricably intertwined with organizational knowledge networks (Ashmos et al, 2000)\nand the willingness of employees to share their social and intellectual capital freely\n(Stewart, 1997). Greater employee participation provides organizations with the\nopportunity to self organize, innovate and co-evolve in more effective ways (Ashmos\net al, 2002). In such pluralist settings, \u201charnessing the capabilities and commitment of\nknowledge workers is, it might be argued, the central managerial challenge of our\ntime. Unfortunately it is a challenge that has not been met\u201d (Manville and Ober,\n2003:48). Despite, several decades of attempts to reconfigure the role of\norganizational hierarchy by empowering workers and enabling them to participate in\norganization decision making, little progress has been made (Heller, 1998) and\nemployees remain essentially disenfranchised (Manville and Ober, 2003).\nFor at the same time as organizations strive to build the commitment of their\nemployees, they are engaged in a second objective tugging in the opposite direction;\none of standardizing procedures, integrating systems and creating consistent\ncorporate cultures (Adler, 1999). The rational bureaucratic model of organising,\nimplicit in this objective runs deep in managerial mindsets; how can business leaders\nimprove on such a well-developed concept of how human beings collectively best\naccomplish their objectives (Child and McGrath, 2001)? Despite their best intentions\nto empower employees, most are still working from a perspective that values unity\nand control over plurality (Brunson, 2002). Thus attempts to liberalise the workplace\nthrough strategies of empowerment and culture management have only tended to\nreinforce a hierarchical approach to organization, one that values conformity, a\npriority toward economic and technical values, power focussed at the corporate\ncentre and top down decision making (Willmott, 1993, Cludts, 1999).\nIn recent years, there have been a variety of academic discourses that have sought\nin different ways to address the issues of coherence and plurality. These have\nincluded the development of stakeholder theory (Clarkson, 1995, Donaldson, 1999)\n3Organizational Citizenship Behaviours (OCB) (Organ, 1988, Podaskoff and\nMackenzie, 1997), Community of Practice (COP) theory (Lave and Wenger, 1991,\nBrown and Duguid, 1991, 2001) and the nascent coevolutionary and complex\nsystems movements (Lewin and Volberda, 1999, Galunic and Eisenhardt, 2001).\nOften coming from different epistemological traditions, each makes a helpful\ncontribution to the debate. However, we argue in this paper that, despite offering rich\ninsights into the issue, none provide, nor in some cases are intended to provide,\nsenior managers with clear and practical methods of re conceptualising the role of\nbureaucracy in organization.\nWe therefore suggest that there is a significant lacuna in the literature as to how\nexecutives can best capitalise on plurality whilst still retaining levels of organizational\ncoherence. This paper will contribute to this debate by developing the concept of\norganizational voluntarism as a potential contribution to re configuring the role of\nhierarchy in pluralist organizational forms. The COP conceptualisation of\norganizations as communities of communities, mirrors a similar discourse in the\npolitical philosophy literature about the role and value of voluntarism as a\nconstituency of mature societies (Etzioni, 1999, Putnam, 2000, Verba et al, 1995).\nFrom a communitarian perspective, in the \u2018good\u2019 society the moral voice that\ndetermines the nature of good citizenship is the product of a diversity of voluntary\nassociations or communities. These groups serve to mediate between the private\nworld of individuals and the large institutions of society. However, most importantly, a\ngood society is determined by such voluntary associations implicitly inculcating a\nlevel of self-control in its members by introducing them to particular values that\nreinforce individuals\u2019 normative commitments to that society. We propose that in an\norganizational setting, voluntarism can provide a means of harnessing plurality whilst\nstill encouraging voluntary levels of coherence because identification with the\norganization or its constituent parts are cultivated within a framework free from senior\nmanagement control.\nThe analysis of the above literature suggests that this issue is inherently concerned\nwith how institutional schema are influenced by, and exert influence on individual\naction. The investigation of voluntarism in organizations therefore lends itself to a\nperspective in which action and structure are linked through social relationships\n(Giddens, 1984, Hales, 1999, Blaikie, 1993). From this standpoint, we will explore\nhow institutional schemata both constrain and encourage the values of voluntarism\nand demonstrate why voluntarism may emerge as a natural stage in the evolution of\norganizations. We explore in greater detail the nature of the disjuncture in the\npractical and theoretical discourses about the evolving nature of organizations and\nprovide a clear rationale for the adoption of organizational voluntarism as an\norganising principle in pluralist settings.\nOur intention here is to promote the concept of organizational voluntarism, and in\ndoing so, hope to stimulate feedback and debate as to its efficacy in furthering the\ndiscourse on corporate responsibility. At a time of growing unease about the role of\norganisations in society and the attendant consequences for corporate governance\nand social responsibility, the issue of who determines the \u2018moral voice\u2019 in\norganisations is significant (Courpasson and Dany, 2003). In this context, voluntary\nassociation may serve to mediate between individuals and their work organisation in\na way that enables employees to contribute to this debate.\n4Theories of organising that reflect increasing plurality\nThere has been much consideration of how the broader shifts in the nature of social\ninstitutions are impacting organizational forms (Sparrow and Cooper 1998, Cohen\n1999). Gratton and Ghoshal (2003) describe this \u2018revolution\u2019 in terms of a desire for\nindividuals to express their potential, the need for protection from the arbitrary use of\npower, and involvement in people determining the conditions of their association\n(2003:1). These types of change are consequently seen to be transforming individual\nrelationships with institutions at both social and organizational levels, but at their core\nreflect the primacy of individuals and their capacity to act with autonomy (Gratton and\nGhoshal, 2003, Patten, 2001).\nAt the same time as demands for more participative organization forms increase, the\ncompetitive business environment forces these organizations to be more efficient and\nresponsive, in turn creating loosely coupled and structurally diverse forms with varied\nand competing interests (Butcher and Clarke, 2002). In such pluralistic settings\n\u2018leadership roles are shared, objectives divergent and power diffuse\u2019 (Denis et al,\n2001:809) and sustainable competitive advantage is seen to lie in \u201cmicro assets that\nare hard to discern and awkward to trade\u201d (Johnson et al, 2003:4). These assets are\nmost likely to lie at the edges of organizations in the hands of line managers, such\nthat more people, more often, need to be involved in strategy than ever before (ibid).\nFor an increasing number of commentators this shift in power toward employees\nsubstantially changes the role and function of organization hierarchy to a degree that\nexecutives cannot ignore (Handy, 1997, Gratton, 2004). Managing these power shifts\nand plurality of interests therefore reflects a natural evolution in organization form. If\nthis transition is inevitable, then what are the markers of organization form that will\nfacilitate this change in practice? The significance of this question has stimulated rich\nresearch and debate about future organizational forms.\nIn this regard, considerable attention has been given to the conceptual development\nof stakeholder theory as one approach to resolving these dilemmas (Kochan and\nRubinstein, 2000). In stakeholder theory, a firm\u2019s survival is seen as being dependent\nupon its ability to create sufficient wealth, value or satisfaction for all its interested\nparties, including employees (Clarkson, 1995, Donaldson, 1999, Jones, 1999,\nFriedman and Miles 2002, Phillips et al, 2003). At its most fundamental, stakeholder\ntheory questions the primary purpose of corporations as the pursuit of shareholder\nreturn. This unitary approach to ownership is increasingly seen as unsustainable in a\nsociety where multiple stakeholders, in effect, \u2018invest\u2019 in the corporation. Authors\nsuch as Etzioni (1998) claim that all such interests should have the opportunity to\nparticipate in organizational governance. Aside of high profile debate as a theory of\nsocial renewal (Giddens, 1998), stakeholder theorists, however, as John Hendry\npoints out, \u201chave either restricted themselves to very modest claims as to the respect\nto be afforded to stakeholders within the existing legal and institutional structure, or,\nmore commonly, pitched their claims so high as to sacrifice any practical credibility\u201d\n(2001:223). Others argue that a more in depth appreciation of the power and identity\nof different types of stakeholder (including employees) and how they change over\ntime is required (Friedman and Miles, 2002, Jawahar and McLauglin, 2001, Rowley\nand Moldoveanu, 2003).\n5However, much debate in the stakeholder field reflects the central issue of this paper;\nhow best to resolve the problems of a normative (ethical) response to a plurality of\ninterests, or an instrumental (economic performance) response to stakeholder theory\n(Donaldson 1999). Yet this dialogue has for the most part, we believe, been\nconducted in the arcane language of academia and had little practical impact on\nthinking of senior management (Halal, 2000). In this regard, Hendry (2001), Rowley\nand Moldoveanu (2003), and to an extent Donaldson (1999), suggest that more\nprogress might be made if stakeholder theory gives greater weight to the idea of the\norganization as a complex system of social relationships, an area of \u2018huge\nimportance\u2019 in understanding emerging organization forms (Child and McGrath,\n2001). In this way, the ethical and economic conflicts of stakeholder theory can be\nunderstood as being resolved in the same way as the moral conflicts of individual\nmanagers facing the practical dilemmas of everyday life.\nAnother approach to the problem has been to encourage the development of\nOrganization Citizenship Behaviours (Organ, 1988, Podaskoff and Mackenzie, 1997,\nBolino, 1999, Ryan, 2001, Wat and Shaffer, 2005). These are described as individual\nbehaviours that are discretionary, not directly or explicitly recognised by formal\nreward systems and that in aggregate promote the effective functioning of an\norganization (Organ, 1988). This concept therefore implicitly acknowledges the value\nof individual contributions. However, despite many years of theoretical development,\ncritics contend that the refinement of OCB as a concept has been constrained by the\nreliability and validity of the measurement systems employed (Van Dyne at al, 1995,\nAllen et al 2000) and is merely \u201cold wine in new bottles\u201d and indistinguishable from\nconstructs such as commitment and altruism that have been subject to more rigorous\nresearch (Latham et al, 1997). \u201cOCB is currently in danger of degenerating into a\ncontentless construct to the extent it defines everything and anything and hence\ncannot advance our understanding of employee behaviour\u201d (ibid:207).\nNor is there any great clarity as to the motives for employees to adopt OCB without\nwhich operationalising the concept at work remains difficult. Differences of opinion\nseem to exist as to the importance of context (Karambayya, 1990, Turnipseed and\nMurkison, 2000), protestant work ethic, (Ryan, 2002), moral reasoning (Ryan 2001)\nand impression management (Bolino, 1999). Most importantly, Graham (2000) draws\nattention to the inherently unitary conception of the central OCB tenet of \u2018civic virtue\u2019.\nIn most of the OCB literature, this construct reflects purely affiliative and conformist\n(Speier and Frese, 1997) behaviour. In doing, so it avoids discussion about the\nlegitimacy of existing power distributions and negates the value of challenge and\npolitical action central to the traditional conception of citizenship and thus for citizens\nto change the social order in which they are located.\nA further avenue of research is to be found in the development of communities of\npractice theory (COP) (Lave and Wenger, 1991, Brown and Duguid, 1991, 2001).\nFrom a COP perspective, the plurality of organizational life is reflected in the\nconception of organizations as dynamic communities of communities (Brown and\nDuguid, 1991). In these communities learning, innovation and its dissemination take\nplace in both formal and informal groups. The COP literature sheds light on how\nknowledge and innovation is freely shared or restricted by structure and potentially\nprovides insight into how senior managers might address some of the tensions of\ncoherence and plurality in hierarchy.\n6However, as Fox (2000) and Swan et al (2002) highlight, there has been a growing\ntrend in the COP literature to emphasise the idea of communities as a managed\nrather than spontaneous process, one that gives preference to a discourse that omits\nthe role of organizational power and politics. Again, this observation reinforces the\nproblem facing senior management, how can they encourage informal groups without\nrecourse to diktat yet still create levels of organization coherence? Some light is shed\non the issue by Swan et al (2002) in their study of networked innovation within the\nhealth care sector. The authors note how a group of senior managers were able to\naddress this issue by \u201csublimating their business motivations in the cause of\ncommunity building\u201d (2002: 494). However, COP theory is essentially concerned with\nthe relationship between work, learning and innovation (Brown and Duguid, 1991,\n2001) not explicitly with the reconfiguration of hierarchy.\nTwo other complimentary fields of study, which address several of the shortfalls\ndiscussed above, have been the nascent complex systems and co evolutionary\nmovements (Lewin and Volberda, 1999). Both take as their point of departure the\nidea that organization change and evolution are a reflection of multi level and multi\ndirectional causalities in both inter and intra firm interdependencies and thus play\nclose attention to the plurality of interests at play in organizations. Taken from these\nperspectives, organizations are viewed as complex adaptive systems that are\ncontinually self organizing and co evolving (Colbert, 2004). In particular, in contrast to\nsome of the research agenda discussed above, research into the micro-processes of\nevolution emphasise the influence of social connectivity (Ashmos et al 2002) in\nmediating plurality and coherence.\nFor example, research by Schilling and Steensma (2001) suggests that firms that\nexperience complexity in terms of \u201chigh levels of demand and input heterogeneity\u201d\n(ibid 2001:1161) place great value on modular organization forms. That is, firms need\ninternal structural divergence in order to work with growing variations in strategic\nopportunities and industry sub environments (Malnight, 2001). The structural fluidity\nreflected by these modular forms emphasises the importance of social capital and\ndiverse relationships as a significant process for mobilising coherent activity rather\nthan merely hierarchical position (Denis et al, 2001, Butcher and Clarke, 2002).\nIndeed, research by Ashmos et al (2002) suggests that increasing participation in\ndecision making increases this social connectivity which in turn gives the\norganization the opportunity to self-organise and co evolve in more effective ways. In\nthis way, levels of coherence are produced from a plurality of interests.\nNevertheless, considerable questions remain unanswered about mediating\ncoherence and plurality. For example, whilst some insight into the effect of\ninstitutionalised power relationships is provided by Pettigrew (1995) and Child and\nMcGrath (2001), this issue warrants further attention. For example, Ashmos et al\n(2002) provide little information as to exactly what form participation should take; in\nwhat way is it constrained or enabled by hierarchy? In a similar vein, Levinthal and\nWarglien (1999) note, with some irony, that while ideas of self-organization have\ncaptured enormous attention, practitioners and academics have been left with a\npuzzle, how are such self-organizing systems to be controlled and directed?\nFurthermore, what might be the motivation of individual managers to work in this\nway? Brown and Eisenhardt (1997), in highlighting the role of \u2018semi structures\u2019 in\ncomplex environments that help create a balance between chaos and inertia, focus\non the motives of autonomy, choice and an opportunity for improvisation. However,\nthere is no rigorous framework that seeks to map out the cognitions of managers\n7working in these ways. Thus Denis et al stress that \u201cthe question of how pluralistic\norganizations develop enough coherence among their parts to allow deliberate\nstrategic change remains unanswered\u201d (2001:809).\nThe disjuncture between organizational theory and practice\nThe size of this lacuna is further magnified by a substantial disjuncture between the\ntheory and practice of organization design. Despite increasing employee participation\nnoted by commentators such as Gratton and Ghoshal (2003) and Cloke and\nGoldsmith (2002), Thompson and Davidson (1995) suggest that this alleged\n\u2018progress\u2019 bears little resemblance to the reality of organizational life. Despite the\npressure on executives to reconsider the conventions of organizational structure,\nthese emerging operating principles remain in their infancy because they appear at\nodds with the dominant bureaucratic logic of organizing (Child and McGrath, 2001).\nThis logic has been described as a \u2018rational mindset\u2019 (Butcher and Atkinson 2001) or\n\u2018rational myth\u2019 (Czarniawska, 2003). This type of mental model or schema is\ndeveloped through experience of the wider institutions of organizational and social\nlife and acts as a deep influence on action (Giddens, 1984). In this rational mindset\npriority is given to the enactment of a hierarchy that reflects technical and economic\nvalues, power focussed at the corporate centre, top down decision making and\norganizational structures and systems that encourage unitary working (Butcher and\nAtkinson, 2001, Brunson, 2002).\nSuch is the influence of this mindset, that attempts to empower employees and to\ncreate less authoritarian organization cultures only tend to reinforce levels of\nnormative control and unitary approaches to managing (Cludts, 1999, Willmott, 1993,\nRobertson and Swan, 2003). This has the effect of creating a gap between the\nrhetoric of employee participation and the reality of organizational control (Legge,\n1995). In turn, this encourages cynicism (Dean et al, 1998) and a calculative\napproach to participation (Cludts, 1999). The pre eminence of this schema also has\nthe effect of diminishing the legitimacy of alternative models of organising and thus\nthe opportunity for radically reframing the role of participation and its role in hierarchy\nremains under-explored by senior managers (Cludts, 1999). Therefore, not only is\nthere a substantial lacuna in organization theory as to how executives should seek to\nreconceptualise the role of bureaucracy (Adler, 1999), but this gap is exacerbated by\na managerial mindset that actively \u2018rationalises\u2019 attempts to address the issue.\nBased on this review, we argue that any new theory of hierarchy and participation\nmust be comprehensive enough to make good the shortfalls identified in the existing\ndiscourses we have discussed. We believe that there are at least four different\ncriteria that any such new theory in this area must adequately reflect. Firstly,\naxiomatic to the debate, is the need to reflect the increasing trend toward plural\norganization settings (Denis et al, 2001) in which the need to respond to individual\nautonomy and independence, particularly amongst critical knowledge workers and\nmanagers is central to organization success. Secondly, any new theory must be able\nto surface the influences of dense and interrelated social relationships and\ncommunity norms on participatory behaviour. Managers negotiate these relationships\nboth as part of what they do and to establish what they should do (Hales, 1999) and\nthis process is therefore critical in understanding how systemic structural\ncharacteristics (Giddens, 1984) both influence and are influenced by an alternative\nconceptualisation of hierarchy. Thirdly, against this backdrop of partisan interest, new\n8theory must therefore also be able to explain why managers might want to adopt a\ndifferent approach to hierarchy and participation. What are the interpretative\nschemas that managers use to make meaningful actions that apparently challenge\nexisting conventions of management? Finally, in order for such an approach to gain\nlegitimacy with senior managers working with a rational mindset, any new theory\nmust be able to make strong linkages to improved organization performance.\nThe extent to which each of the four perspectives discussed here reflect these\ncriteria is summarised in figure 1. However, in brief, whilst each approach provides a\nuseful contribution to the issue of coherence and plurality, there is no one approach\nthat satisfactorily accounts for all four. Stakeholder theory has given insufficient focus\nto the requirements of employees \u2013 and other stakeholders \u2013 (Friedman and Miles,\n2002), and OCB has neglected the issue of power and politics in the\nconceptualisation of citizenship (Graham, 2000). This has also largely been an\nomission in COP theory (Fox, 2000), albeit that more recent treatments are seeking\nto redress this position. The Complexity and Co evolutionary theories reflect well the\nissues of social connectivity but provide insufficient insight into the motivations of\nindividual actors to work with or encourage greater levels of participation and how\nthese cognitions are influenced by dominant power relationships. Nor do any of these\napproaches (nor are they really intended to) really provide senior leaders with clear\nand practical principles about reconfiguring the role of hierarchy \u2013 especially without\nresorting to unitary and rational values that implicitly undermine the value of the\nplurality they seek to establish.\nTake in figure 1 about here\nHaving established the extent of the lacuna in this issue and the priorities that new\ntheory must reflect, we turn our attention to an alternative approach \u2013 organizational\nvoluntarism.\nOrganizational Voluntarism\nIn attempting to address this central organizational issue we have found in the arena\nof political philosophy a parallel debate that we consider to be instructive. In the\npolitical discourse surrounding the basis for a \u2018good\u2019 democratic society, the same\npolarised tension between coherence and plurality can be identified. Should society\nrely on the state to shape good citizens, as social conservatives would have it, or\nshould good citizens be the product of a liberal moral pluralism? Writers such as\nEtzioni (1993, 1995, and 1999), Box (1998), and Putnam (2000) promote a third,\ncommunitarian approach to tackling this issue that has many parallels for the debate\nabout the role of organizational hierarchy. From a communitarian perspective, in the\ngood society the moral voice that determines the nature of good citizenship is the\nproduct of a diversity of voluntary associations. These associations range from\nmembership of local community action groups to membership of political parties and\nserve to mediate between the private world of individuals and the large institutions of\nsociety. The opportunity to selectively participate in associations, free from state\ninfluence, is fundamental to the creation and preservation of liberty. However, most\nimportantly, a good society is determined by such voluntary associations implicitly\ninculcating a level of self-control in its members by introducing them to particular\nvalues that reinforce individuals\u2019 normative commitments to that society. It is the\nopportunity to choose the psychological communities to which one is committed and\n9the ability to cultivate a set of core values within a framework as free from coercion\nas possible, that is the hallmark of a mature democratic society.\nWhilst we acknowledge that organizations do not mirror society exactly, there are\nincreasing similarities between the two contexts to justify the value of a theory of\nsocial participation in an organization setting. In both an organizational and political\ninstitutional setting the issue is the same, how best to encourage collective\ncommitment toward super ordinate goals without recourse to sanctions (Brightman\nand Moran, 1999). In both settings, power is increasingly distributed across different\ninstitutions and interest groups (Etzioni, 1998) and there is continual competition\nbetween groups for support of worthy causes (Denis et al 2001, McPherson and\nRotolo, 1996, Rowley and Moldoveanu, 2003). In this context, organizational\nleadership, like its political institutional counterpart, is implicitly concerned with how to\ncoalesce support for action whilst valuing difference and conflict (Peters and\nWilliams, 2002).\nWe therefore believe that voluntarism has the potential for illuminating organization\ntheory and offers two particular benefits. Firstly, at a time of increasing concern over\nthe role of organizations in society, and the attendant consequences for corporate\ngovernance and social responsibility (Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 2001) the issue of\nwho determines the moral voice in organizations is of growing interest (Courpasson\nand Dany, 2003). As democratic systems of governance protect the right to voluntary\nassociation, so organizational hierarchy may serve to legitimise this same principle\n(Coopey and Burgoyne, 2000, Courpasson and Dany, 2003). In doing so, such\nvoluntary association may serve to mediate between individuals and their work\norganization in a way that enables participation in the establishment of organization\nvalues and which builds commitment to the establishment of moral communities\n(d\u2019Iribarne 2003, Courpasson and Dany 2003). Secondly, the application of\nvoluntarism in a pluralistic organization setting may provide an alternative conception\nof hierarchy in so much that voluntarism encourages a level of self-organization that\ncan facilitate organizational coherence irrespective of managerial diktat. This self-\norganization is increasingly viewed as critical for encouraging the necessary levels of\ninnovation and continual reconfiguration of strategic capabilities necessary for\nsustained competitive advantage. (Child and MacGrath, 2001, Rindova and Kotha,\n2001).\nAt this time, when set against the dominance of the rational mindset and the\nillegitimacy of alternative approaches, voluntaristic behaviour in organizations can be\nbest understood as an expression of individual agency. Its wider adoption as a\nmanagerial approach will depend upon its legitimisation as a useful organising\nprinciple. It is important to note however, that we see hierarchy and plurality as\nalways being in tension; they are at one level dialectically opposed, and at another,\nboth essential aspects of organizing (Brunson, 2002). As in mature societies, once\nlevels of democracy have been attained, the focus for political discourse is one of\nexpressing preferences about its enactment. We do not suggest therefore that\nvoluntarism will resolve this tension in plurality and coherence, but instead that it\nprovides a \u2018relational synthesis\u2019 (Clegg, 2003:378) of both, in which progress toward\nmore responsible organization forms may be made by going beyond the notion that\nmore of one necessitates less of the other.\nIn this context we define organizational voluntarism as a stage of organizational\nevolution\/a marker of pluralistic organizational form in which managers recognise the\n10\nneed to engage in debate and action to pursue matters of individual and organization\nconcern irrespective of hierarchical position or explicit authority. This definition is\npremised on the idea that unofficially constituted groups in organizational settings are\nable to provide the level of self-control necessary for the maintenance of\norganizational congruence; a multiplicity of stakeholder agendas does not\nnecessarily create organizational incoherence (Rowley and Moldoveanu, 2003,\nThietart and Forgues, 1997). Further, that these groups are more likely to do so when\nthey can express voice and contest views about which organization values are\nimportant to them (Cludts, 1999, Rousseau and Shperling, 2003) without the\nintervention of formal authority. As with voluntary associations, such organizational\narrangements would bring people together to pursue interests through collective\naction, serve to distribute power, and mediate between individuals and the\norganization, thereby creating a sense of involvement (Cabrera and Cabrera, 2002).\nIt is in the nature of voluntarism that some groups may be focussed on issues of\ncritical organization concern, others may be more parochial in outlook. Crucially\nhowever, they would collectively and voluntarily facilitate the flow of information\nbetween different groups (Brown and Duguid, 1991) and the organizational\nconnectivity required to stimulate innovation (Ashmos et al, 2002).\nThe concepts of voluntarism and communitarianism are not without their detractors.\nFor example, communitarianism has often been seen as taking insufficient account of\ninstitutionalised power relationships (Reynolds, 2000, Giddens, 1984). Critical\ntheorists have been keen to highlight the dark side of communities that tend to imply\nor assume coherence and consensus (Contu and Willmott, 2003, Reynolds, 2000).\nThus, it is important to stress here that the conception of voluntarism discussed in\nthis paper is very much concerned with the \u201cpolitics of difference\u201d (Reynolds,\n2000:71) where conflicts and differences are accepted as being inevitable and not\nalways resolvable. This orientation is similar to the notion of an \u2018arena\u2019 described by\nBurgoyne and Jackson, (1997) in the context of management learning in which\n\u201cdifferences \u2018meet\u2019, are fought over and reconciled and reconfigured into new\ngroupings, factions and alliances\u201d (1997:61). In this way, voluntarism is the synthesis\nof a \u2018managed\u2019 and a non coercive process of participation.\nThe difference between one system of governance and another is the capacity that\nindividuals have to both deliberate and make decisions (March and Olsen, 1995).\nOrganizational voluntarism redefines hierarchy as a process to encourage voluntary\ngroups and individuals to deliberate and decide upon their own identity minimising,\nregulation through institutional control. This may still take the form of praise, reward\nor support, but avoiding coercion towards unitary priorities, in order that these groups\nthemselves in turn influence the establishment of organizational core values.\nExtending the parallel with democratic governance, the role of hierarchy would also\nbe to mediate between deserving causes, challenging constituents to justify the\nsignificance of their agendas and their demands for resource. The role of top\nmanagement would remain to provide fundamental organizational framing, but that\nthis would take into consideration many voices, and by satisfactorily justifying their\nconclusions and actions to their constituents.\nIn this context, organizational leadership comes to reflect a collective phenomena\n(Barker, 1997) in which the representation of different organization constituencies, by\na wide range of individuals assumes a greater significance. In practice, this means\nthat politics, as with its counterpart in a political institutional setting, is a necessary\nand logical process by which diverse interests and stakeholders are reconciled\n11\n(Butcher and Clarke, 2002, Held, 1987). Indeed, as with the political institutional\nmodel, significant interest groups serve to check the power invested in formal\nhierarchy. Therefore, far from politics being an irrational organizational response\n(Stone, 1997), such activity becomes a judicious way of managing inevitable\ndifferences. The legitimate pursuit of individual and often competing agendas also\nprovides greater opportunities for individuals to negotiate self and work identities and\nthus their identification with wider organizational priorities. This voluntary process is\nbest achieved by leadership behaviours that encourage self-organization (Daboub,\n2002), valuing difference and conflict (Ashcraft, 2001), the protection of weaker\ngroups (Galunic and Eisenhardt, 2001) and helping groups to create their own values\nand ethics (Cludts, 1999).\nThis \u2018representative leadership\u2019 is essential to ensure that participation does not\nbecome \u2018enforced\u2019 and thus merely provide a more sophisticated from of control\n(Robertson and Swan, 2003). This form of participation is predicated on leaders\nacknowledging their responsibility to act as stewards of constructive political activity,\nwithout which individuals have no legitimate process of positioning causes and\nreconciling differences. The legitimate use of politics is dependent upon leaders\nbeing able to demonstrate the ethical content of their decisions by their ability to\nbalance personal and organizational interests (Butcher and Clarke, 2001) in the\npursuit of causes that are worthy, from a social, as well as economic point of view\n(Galunic and Eisenhardt, 2001). As such, senior managers will be actively embracing\nthe role of community architect in which the need for civic virtue (Starrat, 2001), the\nability to balance individual interests with those of the social and economic interests\nof the wider organizational community, becomes central to leadership.\nOrganization voluntarism as an emerging theory of organization form\nAt this stage, this view of organization form represents an exploratory contribution to\ntheory (Boisot and Child, 1999), but one that reflects emerging organization practice\nin existing pluralist organization settings. For example, Denis et al, (2001), in their\nstudy of leadership and strategic change in the pluralistic setting of hospital\nadministration, note, in line with our observations of voluntarism, how leadership is\nnecessarily a collective process. In a situation where power is diffuse and objectives\ndivergent, levels of coherence are achieved by constellations of leaders who are\nsensitive to the needs of different constituencies in order to gain credibility and\nsupport. Constructive political activity, in terms of compromise, lobbying, alliances\nand collaborative solutions are central to how support is mobilised. In particular,\nDenis et al note the role of \u201ccreative individuals and committed unified groups in\nproactively moving to make change happen\u201d (2001:834) in situations where the\nlegitimacy of change initiatives cannot be taken for granted. The same conclusions\nare reached by Clarke and Meldrum (1999) in their study of bottom up change and\nLipman-Blumen and Leavitt\u2019s (1999) exploration of \u2018hot groups\u2019 reflects similar\naspects of unofficial behaviour.\nEvidence of the way in which such communities can stimulate change and innovation\nis provided by Swan et al (2002) who demonstrate how radical innovation in the\nhealth care sector was achieved against a backdrop of diverse professional interests\nand uneven power relations. Coherence in approach was achieved through a\ndiscursive strategy, reflective of Reynolds \u201cpolitics of difference\u201d (2000:71), that\nsought to align the competing interests and agendas in the innovation process\nthrough the rhetoric of community and engagement with the diverse interests that\n12\nconstituted that community. Also, the management team were able to balance\ncommercial interests with the broader values of other groups by sublimating purely\neconomic considerations in the cause of community building. Research by Ashmos\net al (2002) suggests that this type of engagement helps to generate multiple\nperspectives of the environment, In turn, this alters an organization\u2019s predisposition\nto new challenges and opportunities, thus stimulating innovation and continual\nadaptation. Similar conclusions are reached by Ravasi and Verona (2001) and Foss\n(2003) in their analysis of the Danish company Oticon. In Oticon, innovation is\nsustained by highly devolved structures and bottom up project proposals, and\nstrategic coherence the product of negotiation amongst a plurality of internal markets,\ncoordinating groups and roles.\nHowever, notwithstanding these examples, central to our argument here is the need\nto stimulate broader debate and theory building about the reconfiguration of\norganizational plurality and coherence. So, to what extent might the concept of\nvoluntarism make good the shortfalls in existing theory building by meeting the four\ncriteria we identified; - the centrality of organizational plurality, the embeddedness of\nsocial relations and power in organizational working, accounting for the motivations\nof managers to pursue actions in contravention of traditional approaches, and the\nneed for clear organizational benefits? Firstly, at a time when plurality of organization\nform is only likely to increase (Denis et al, 2001), the concept of voluntarism clearly\nassumes the inevitability and value of plurality, greater autonomy and choice as\nbeing central to organization success. Diversity of interest and autonomy of individual\naction are prerequisites for voluntarism. Reflecting as they do, broader changes in\nsociety, ultimately, these factors may well be the most significant drivers for the\nadoption of voluntaristic principles. In this way, we view voluntarism as a natural\nstage in the evolution of organization form.\nSecondly, borrowed from communitarian philosophy, voluntarism directly reflects the\ncentrality of social relationships, community and power in the structuration of action\nand thus provides a basis for understanding how institutional power distributions both\ninfluence and are influenced by the enactment of these voluntaristic principles. The\ncentrality of power reflected in the dualism of hierarchy and participation, competition\nand collaboration, local autonomy and strategic coherence, embody the structuration\nof resources, cognitive and moral rules upon which managers draw that both\nconstrains and enables what they do (Hales, 1999, Giddens, 1984). With\norganizational voluntarism, power and its negotiation through political discourse is\npositioned as an explicit leadership activity; \u201cpower is the means of getting things\ndone\u201d (Giddens, 1984:283). For example, Denis et al (2001) highlight how leaders in\npluralistic settings mobilise a range of symbolic and material resources to create\ninfluence and \u201cstrategic couplings\u201d which include; aligning with widely held\nperceptions about organizational issues and environmental constraints, the use of\npositional authority, secrecy, leveraging the credibility of acknowledged performance,\nmaintaining appropriateness of behaviour in the eyes of significant support groups\netc. Through such practices, over time, managers are able to constitute and\nreconstitute what they do and who they are as contextual forces evolve (Denis et al,\n2001).\nHowever, as the authors highlight, their study does not deal with micro level variables\nof individual motivation. Of particular significance to the concept of voluntarism is the\nquestion as to why individuals might wish to engage with ideas that, at least in the\nshort term, are at odds with the dominant rational approach to organising. What are\n13\nthe interpretive schemata (Hales, 1999, Giddens, 1984) that managers draw upon to\nmake their work meaningful in pluralistic settings? For the authors, this question is\nthe subject of ongoing research but initial theorising suggests that a model of\nvoluntaristic behaviour can be informed by the discourse on identity and work\nmeanings (Alvesson and Willmott, 2002, Wrzesniewski and Dutton, 2001, Robertson\nand Swan, 2003, Knights and McCabe, 2003).\nFrom this perspective all managers are continuously engaged in forming and\nrepairing a sense of self-identity that is coherent and distinctive (Alvesson and\nWillmott, 2002). Self-identity is thus a complex mixture of conscious and\nsubconscious elements, an interpretative and reflexive grid of schemas shaped by\nexperience of endless interactions with individuals and societal institutions (Alvesson\nand Willmott, 2002, Giddens, 1984). We argue that the idea of voluntarism as we\nhave described it here reflects a bundle of such schemas or cognitions about\norganizational working that enable some managers to create and sustain viable\ndefinitions of who they are and what they do, often in contravention of\ninstitutionalised arrangements, but that still enhance affirmation of self (Hales 1999,\nWrzesniewski and Dutton, 2001, Weeks and Galunic, 2003). At this stage, we\npropose that voluntaristic leadership behaviour is influenced by four cognitions about\nthe nature of organising and managing; (1) the degree to which organizations are\nconceptualised as places of either plural or unitary interests, (2) the degree to which\n\u2018managing\u2019 concerns the pursuit of individual and or organizational goals, (3) the\nextent to which this influences perceptions of managerial discretion versus\nperceptions of managerial responsibility and (4) the extent to which political debate is\nconsidered an appropriate mechanism for managing competing interests. These\nbriefly are amplified below.\nFirstly, we argue that voluntaristic behaviour is influenced by the extent to which\nindividuals perceive organizations as unitary or pluralistic in form. Organizational\nvoluntarism reflects the notion that in order for managers to deviate from the\nbureaucratic model they must be able to appreciate the genuine legitimacy of a wider\nrange of interests than those determined by a unitary mindset. In turn, this suggests\nthat differences and their resolution must be seen as a central and valuable aspect of\norganizational working rather than an aberration or an additional factor to be\nconsidered in the mix of management behaviour (Nahapiet et al, 2005).\nThe second cognition reflects the idea that if organizations are seen to reflect a\nplurality of interests, it follows from this those individuals will also view autonomy and\npersonal interest as being legitimate. However, as in a political institutional setting,\nsuch a predisposition can only be predicated the basis that this individuality is\nbalanced with a collective sense of morality (Barker, 1997, Knights and McCabe,\n2003). This \u2018civic virtue\u2019 (Starrat, 2001) reflects an understanding \u201cthat the very\nsource of [this] individuality is in effect social not individual\u201d (Knights and McCabe,\n(2003:1594). In this way, \u2018representative\u2019 leaders recognise that the pursuit of their\nown interests is inextricably interwoven with the successful achievement of others\ngoals.\nThe third cognition concerns perceptions about organization discretion and\nautonomy. This is a function of whether managers perceive responsibility \u2013 the\ncommon denominator of all managerial work (Hales, 1999) \u2013 to be given or taken. In\nother words do managers perceive themselves bound by the responsibility for\nachieving assigned outcomes or free to pursue matters of individual or group agency\n14\nas well (Hales 1999, Kakabadse and Kakabadse 2005)? Perceptions of discretion\nare also a function of senior management support and the extent to which such\nindividuals are able to redefine the rules and resources that constrain voluntaristic\nmanagerial action (Hales, 1999).\nThe fourth cognition concerns the legitimacy of politic debate. Managerial work is\nimplicitly concerned with the positioning of causes and is thus inherently political\n(Buchanan and Badham, 1999, Butcher and Clarke, 2001). As in a political\ninstitutional context this may include covert as well as publicly sanctioned activity and\ncan only be viewed as legitimate if employed in the pursuit of organizationally\nworthwhile outcomes. However, such outcomes may be interpreted in different ways.\nThus, political behaviour can only be construed as legitimate if leaders are able\ndemonstrate the ethical content of their decisions by their ability to balance personal\nand organizational interests (Patten, 2001, Butcher and Clarke, 2001) in the pursuit\nof causes that are worthy, from a social, as well as economic point of view (Galunic\nand Eisenhardt, 2002). This is similar to Buchanan\u2019s (1999) notion of a \u2018logic of\npolitical action\u2019 in which individuals justify their behaviour by reference to the\nmaintenance of their reputations, being able to account for their actions and being\nable to identify positive organizational outcomes. In this regard, cognitions of\npersonal interest, predicated on civic virtue, are distinct from perceptions of self\ninterested political behaviour.\nIt is our proposition that these four cognitions act reflexively on each other, and in\nturn, influence the degree to which individual managers may pursue voluntaristic\nbehaviour. In the absence of legitimate alternative models of working with plurality,\nthis cognitive framework enables managers to interpret their circumstances and thus\ntheir identities, in very individual (pluralist) ways. In enacting these schemas,\nmanagers are able to establish levels of micro emancipation (Alvesson and Willmott,\n1996, 2002) because they enable individuals to resolve or at least, work with, rather\nthan \u201cclose off\u201d some of the chronic structural uncertainties of management (Hales\n1999). That is, a voluntaristic mindset promotes a plurality of discourses about the\nnature of organising and thus extends the opportunities for identity formation\n(Alvesson and Willmott, 2002). It is also our premise that even though, over time,\nvoluntarism may gain greater legitimacy in the eyes of senior management, these\nschemas will remain of significance because coherence and plurality, hierarchy and\nparticipation and so on will always remain in tension. To varying degrees, managers\nwill always struggle against the unequal distribution of power implicit in the\nbureaucratic model.\nThe fourth criterion by which new theory must be judged is that of providing strong\nlinkages to improved organization performance, for without which, there is little\nincentive for senior management to adopt such principles. In this regard, we see the\nidea of voluntarism fitting well within the co evolutionary discourse in which the need\nfor organizational flexibility and the continual reconfiguration of strategic capabilities\nis viewed as critical to sustainable competitive advantage in dynamic environments\n(Galunic and Eisenhardt, 2001, Rindova and Kotha, 2001). The concept of\nvoluntarism and its themes of local autonomy and diversity, reflect emerging views as\nto the importance of self-organization in allowing for a dynamic feedback between\nitself and its environment in order to co evolve (Lewin and Volberda, 1999, Ashmos\net al, 2002). The self-organization inherent within the voluntaristic form clearly\nfacilitates the process of rapid reconfiguration to respond to different market\ncircumstances (Galunic and Eisenhardt, 2001, Child and McGrath, 2001, Eisenhardt\n15\nand Martin 2000). Perhaps, most acutely for senior managers, the concept of\nvoluntarism also provides a framework for capitalising on diversity in the pursuit of\ninnovation. Local communities, being at the interface of the organization and its\nenvironment are seen to be a rich source of innovation (Brown and Duguid, 1991,\n2001). Research by Ashmos et al (2002) and Ravasi and Verona (2001) highlight\nhow participation helps to generate multiple perspectives that in turn alters an\norganizations predisposition to new challenges and opportunities and thus potentially\nstimulates innovation. In effect, these ideas reflect further schemas about the\nstructural characteristics of institutions that will serve to legitimate voluntarism in the\neyes of senior management.\nHowever, above all else, we believe that the concept of voluntarism provides senior\nmanagers with a model for merging hierarchical structure with greater egalitarian\npractice (Ashcraft, 2001). Whilst cooperation declines as organization size increases,\nvoluntary group discussion in value setting leads to increased commitment (Cludts,\n1999) and contribution (Cabrera and Cabrera, 2002). Such communication also\nenhances group identity and personal responsibility, which are powerful mechanisms\nof self control (Cabrera and Cabrera, 2002, Cludts, 1999). Indeed, paradoxically,\nmanagers are seen to enhance their authority by participating in this debate (Cludts,\n1999). By acknowledging the tension between, for example, the seemingly\nparadoxical relationships of hierarchy and participation, or local autonomy and\nstrategic coherence, the resulting \u2018organized dissonance\u2019; - the \u201cstrategic union of\nforms presumed to be hostile\u201d - can produce critical levels of organizational\nresonance (Ashcraft, 2001:1304). Indeed, voluntarism may come to be considered as\none of the \u2018few simple but often contradictory rules\u2019 (Galunic and Eisenhardt, 2001)\nthat are believed to guide the development of successful co-evolution.\nConclusion\nAt a time when society is questioning the nature of governance, and corporate\nexecutives searching for more responsible ways to harness the commitment of\nemployees, the concept of voluntarism provides an organising principle that may help\nto synthesise the contradictory demands for strategic coherence and organizational\nplurality. In so doing, it also offers a framework in which work organizations might\nfulfil a broader role in mediating the needs of individuals and society at large.\nOur aim here has been to layout the basic tenets of voluntarism in order to invite\nfurther research and debate. At this stage, when set against the dominance of the\nrational mindset, voluntarism is most likely to be seen as legitimate in contexts that\nrequire high levels of self-organization and where \u201cthe unceasing bubbling of\ncommunities allows the organization to innovate constantly\u201d (Cohendet et al,\n2004:39). However, on the assumption that society and organising will continue to\nreflect an increasing plurality of interests (Denis et al, 2001) we envisage that the\nemancipatory possibilities and operational flexibility offered by voluntarism will\nbecome evermore attractive to senior managers and employees alike.\nThe asymmetric distribution of power evident in most organization settings suggests\nthat voluntarism will not emerge bottom up. Kochan and Rubinstein (2000) and\nPatten (2001) note that the influence of powerful leaders is critical to the\nestablishment of more democratic forms of governing. Leaders wishing to encourage\nthe wider adoption of such principles are thus faced with a dilemma; how to ensure\nthat voluntarism, like that of COP, does not come to reflect a more sophisticated\n16\nprocess of social control? To avoid this trap, organization leaders will need to be\ngenuinely interested in representing the motivations and interests of those they lead.\nBased on our analysis here we offer the following proposition;\nThat managers who pursue \u2018representative leadership\u2019 behaviours will be\ninfluenced by cognitions of organization working that reflect (1) plurality of\ninterests, (2) the value of personal interest and (3) the need to \u2018take\u2019\nresponsibility and (4) the value of political models in the reconciliation of\ncompeting interests.\nThat is, perceptions about organizational pluralism (1) drive perceptions of the value\nof individual interest (2) and the need to exercise discretion (3). These cognitions in\nturn encourage a positive approach to a political model of behaviour (4). Each of\nthese informs and reinforces the others in a reflexive manner.\nThis proposition now forms the basis for a research agenda that will focus on the\nlived experience of individual managers, and can be seen as a response to calls for\nmore research on the micro activities of what managers do and why they do it\n(Johnson et al, 2003). In particular, it will attempt to illuminate the relationship\nbetween identity formation and micro emancipation (Alvesson and Willmott, 2002) by\ninvestigating some of the \u201cmaterial, moral and cognitive grounds of managing\u201d\n(Hales, 1999).\nReferences\nAdler, P.
