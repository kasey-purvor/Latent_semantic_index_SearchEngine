Thirty volunteers took part in a four-week flexibility training programme. \nThey were randomly assigned to one of three groups: movement imagery (MI), this group \nimagined moving the limb they were stretching; stretching imagery (SI), this group imagined \nthe physiological processes involved in stretching the muscle; and control, this group did not \nengage in mental imagery. Active and passive range of motion around the hip was assessed \nbefore and after the programme. Participants provided specific ratings of vividness and \ncomfort throughout the programme.  \nResults showed significant increases in flexibility over time, but no differences between the \nthree groups. A significant relationship was found, however, between flexibility gain and \nvividness ratings in the MI group. Furthermore, both imagery groups scored significantly \nhigher than the control group on levels of comfort, with the MI group also scoring \nsignificantly higher than the SI group. It was concluded that the imagery had stronger \npsychological than physiological effects, but that there is potential for enhancing \nphysiological effects by maximising imagery vividness, particularly for movement imagery.  \n 3 \nIntroduction \nMental imagery has been studied extensively, both inside and outside of the sports domain. A \nconsiderable number of studies have shown that mental imagery can produce a wide range of \nphysiological responses (Qualls, 1982-83; Sheikh et al., 1989; Deschaumes-Molinaro et al., \n1992; Kunzendorf and Hall, 2001). Within the sport setting the most well-known \nphysiological response to imagery is the electromyographic (EMG) activity produced in \nmuscles as a result of imagining movement (Harris and Robinson, 1986; Bakker et al., 1996).  \nThis response (sometimes referred to as \u201cefferent leakage\u201d or \u201cefferent outflow\u201d, \nLang, 1979; Boschker, 2001) is generally an unintentional and implicit by-product resulting \nfrom the process of imaging movement (although from a theoretical perspective, the activity \nis often ascribed a role in indicating imagery effectiveness, e.g. in changing behaviour, Lang, \n1984, 1985; or enhancing motor performance, Smith et al., 2001). At the same time, a \nparticular physiological response may also be the intended end-product of an imagery \nexercise. This may be through the use of emotive imagery (e.g. intended to affect respiratory \nprocesses involved in asthma attacks, Ritz et al., 2002), imagery of behaviours that affect \nphysical responses (e.g. imaging holding the hands over a fire to raise hand temperature, \nBlanchard and Andrasik, 1985; imaginary training of specific movements to improve muscle \nstrength, Yue and Cole, 1992), or imagery of specific physiological responses themselves \n(e.g. imaging tissue healing during rehabilitation from sports injury, Porter and Foster, 1990; \nIevleva and Orlick, 1993; Cupal and Brewer, 2001). From research on immune system \nimagery there is some evidence to suggest that mentally imaging specific changes in a \nselected physiological process can produce concomitant changes in this process (Rider and \nAchterberg, 1989; Rider et al., 1990). In the sport and exercise setting, some initial evidence \nsuggests that this type of imagery applied to the healing process of a sports injury is \n 4 \nassociated with a faster recovery (Ievleva and Orlick, 1991; Cupal and Brewer, 2001). While \nthese studies indicate that it may be possible to effect physiological changes through directed \nmental activity, it is still far from clear where the boundaries lie in influencing physiological \nprocesses via mental imagery.  \nThe present study aimed to explore these boundaries further by focusing on both \nspecific physiological imagery and movement imagery in relation to the physiological \nprocess of flexibility. As stretching takes time and offers a possibility for personal thoughts, \nstretching time may be an occasion when athletes employ mental imagery of their skills \n(personal observation). Considering the efferent leakage of EMG-activity often found during \nmovement imagery and the associated potential for contracting effects in the muscles, we \nwondered whether this type of imagery during stretching might be counter-productive to the \nintended lengthening of the muscle. At the same time, we wanted to investigate if specific \nphysiological imagery of the muscle elongating might have the opposite effect. This type of \nimagery corresponds with the idea that imagery of specific physiological processes might \ninfluence those processes, as suggested by the Rider et al. studies (1989, 1990), and is \nintuitively more apt for use during stretching than movement imagery.  \nHence, the purpose of this study was to explore the effect of using different forms of \nmental imagery during stretching on subsequent increases in flexibility. Specific questions \ninvolved (1) Does movement imagery during stretching interfere with the intended effect of \nthe stretching? It was hypothesized that stretching accompanied by movement imagery would \nlead to smaller increases in flexibility than stretching without imagery. (2) Does stretching \nimagery (i.e. mentally imaging the muscles and tendons becoming longer) during stretching \naugment the effect of the stretching? It was hypothesized that stretching accompanied by \nstretching imagery would lead to greater increases in flexibility than stretching without \nimagery. (3) Does imagery vividness influence the effect of the image content on the \n 5 \nstretching? Since it is generally assumed that the degree of vividness of the imagery is \nassociated with the magnitude of the physiological response (Qualls, 1982-83; Sheikh et al., \n1989), it was hypothesized that the correlation between vividness levels and flexibility \nincrease would be positive for stretching imagery and negative for movement imagery.  \nIn addition to evaluating the effect of the imagery on flexibility gain, we were also interested \nin exploring a number of aspects of imagery vividness in relation to the requirement of \ngenerating images during physical exercises. Although several authors have addressed the \nuse of movements during imagery (Gould et al., 2002; Holmes and Collins, 2001) and \nimagery during movement (Hanrahan et al., 1995; Coote and Tenenbaum, 1998; Van Gyn et \nal., 1990), the bulk of the literature focuses on imagery conducted in a quiet, non-moving, \noften relaxed, state, and very little is known about the use of imagery during physical \nexercise. Specifically, we aimed to explore the following questions: (a) can imagery \nvividness during stretching be predicted by a general measure of imagery ability, (b) what are \nparticipants\u201f experiences with regard to the ease or difficulty of generating images during \nstretching, and (c) does imagery influence the level of comfort experienced during the \nstretches? It was hypothesized that movement imagery would have an adverse effect on the \ncomfortableness of the stretch (as it might result in muscles slightly contracting), while \nstretching imagery would have a favourable effect. \nMethod  \nParticipants \nVolunteers were recruited among employees of a regional university in the north east of \nEngland. Forty seven employees, 25 men and 22 women (mean age 40.8 years, S.D. 9.8), \nvolunteered to take part in a four-week flexibility training programme. They were matched \nfor age and gender and were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (a) movement \n 6 \nimagery (MI); this group imagined that they were moving the leg they were stretching, (b) \nstretching imagery (SI); this group imagined the muscles becoming longer; and (c) control; \nthis group did not engage in imagery during stretching. All participants were Caucasian. \nParticipants were screened for medical problems and provided written consent before taking \npart in the study.  \nTasks \nThe training programme consisted of 11 half-hour sessions, and was designed to \npredominantly increase flexibility around the hip joint. Each session involved a 5-7 minute \nwarm-up, followed by a series of seven stretching exercises. The physical components of the \ntraining programme were the same for all three groups. The flexibility exercises included:  \n(1) standard sit-and-reach (ex. #46 in Alter, 1988), (2) straddle sit-and-reach (ex. #47 and  \n#75 in Alter, 1988), (3 and 4) straight leg raise assisted by hands pulling leg towards the face; \nfirst right, then left (ex. #6 in Alter, 1996), (5) calf stretching (ex. #7 in Alter, 1996); both \nlegs simultaneously, (6 and 7) straddle sit-and-reach with one leg bent; first right, then left \n(ex. #10 in Alter, 1996). Each stretch was executed three times, with a 20-second rest period \nin between. The duration of the stretch increased from 20 seconds in the first training session \nvia 25 seconds in the second session to 30 seconds in the third and subsequent sessions.   \nThe content of the imagery to be used by the two imagery groups was explained to the \nparticipants individually, on the day of the pre-test. Participants in the MI group were told to \nimagine continually moving the leg they were stretching by repeatedly flexing the knee, \nbringing the heel towards the buttocks. The idea of the movement was demonstrated by the \nexperimenter in a standing position using one leg. Suggestions were given about how to \nimagine the movement in the different stretching positions. It was emphasized that \nparticipants needed to try to both see and feel the movements. \n 7 \nParticipants in the SI group were instructed to imagine the muscle becoming longer, at \ncellular level during the first 15-25 seconds of the stretch, then for the muscle as a whole \nduring the last 5 seconds of the stretch. The cellular level imagery involved picturing the \nsliding movements of the actin and myosin filaments to create a lengthening of the muscle \nfibres. The content of this image was first explained verbally, accompanied by a manual \ndemonstration of the sliding movements using the hands, as well as by showing figures from \nAlter (1988, p.14, 18) depicting the actin and myosin filaments in different stages of \ncontraction and elongation. The participants then viewed a 2-minute section on the muscular \nsystem from the CD-ROM BodyWorks (1998), which explained muscular contraction and \nelongation and contained three-dimensional visual images of contracting and elongating \nmuscles in motion. The participants also received drawings of the actin\/myosin filaments in \ndifferent stages of elongation. \nMeasures \nFlexibility \nFlexibility measures consisted of active and passive range of motion (ROM) around the hip \njoint, assessed unilaterally on the dominant leg at baseline and at the end of the training \nprogram. All measures, pre- and post, were taken by the same research assistant who was \nblind to the experimental condition of the participants. Measurement procedures were similar \nto those described by Roberts and Wilson (1999). Prior to testing each participant, time, date \nand room temperature were recorded so that conditions could be matched at post-test. Each \nparticipant completed a 5 minute aerobic warm-up on an exercise bicycle at 60-80% Heart \nRate Maximum, after which the assessment of (first active, then passive) ROM was \nconducted. All movements took place in the sagittal plane following the assumption of the \nfundamental anatomical position. Angular displacement was measured using an inclinometer \n 8 \n(Maud and Cortez-Cooper, 1995), and procedural guidelines recommended by MacDougall et \nal. (1991) were followed to determine start and end positions of ROM. Following \nidentification of anatomical landmarks the inclinometer was positioned, markings were made \nand the distance of the inclinometer from the joint centre was recorded for future reference. \nThe inclinometer was then removed and the stretching movement performed, either actively \nor passively. The inclinometer was subsequently replaced in the same \u201emarked\u201f position after \nwhich the measurement was recorded. The end of passive ROM was determined once the \ntester felt resistance or the participant vocalized discomfort. Each movement was repeated \nthree times and recorded in degrees. The average of the three measures served as the final \nflexibility score.  \nImagery vividness \nImagery vividness was assessed both as a general ability measure before the study and as a \ncondition-specific measure during the study. The Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire \n(VVIQ, Marks, 1973) was used to measure general imagery ability. This is a brief and \nstandardized measure of imagery vividness, of which reliability and validity are well-\nestablished (Marks, 1999) and which has been shown to be related to the ability to influence \nphysiological processes (Sheikh et al., 1989). It consists of 16 items, which are rated on a 5-\npoint scale ranging from \u201cperfectly clear and as vivid as normal vision\u201d to \u201cno image at all, \nyou only \u201eknow\u201f that you are thinking of an object\u201d. Normally, VVIQ items are scored from \n1 highly vivid to 5 not vivid at all (Marks, 1973). However, in order to maintain the same \ndirection across scales within the study, the scores were reversed, with 1 indicating low \nvividness and 5 indicating high vividness. Participants completed the VVIQ individually, \nand, in accordance with Marks\u201f (1973) recommendations, rated the items twice, once with \ntheir eyes open and once with their eyes closed. An overall VVIQ score was calculated for \neach participant as an average of the 32 vividness ratings. \n 9 \nCondition-specific vividness was assessed throughout the study, by participants \nindicating the vividness of their images after every stretching exercise. Using 9-point scales \nranging from 1 \u201cnot vivid at all\u201d to 9  \u201cextremely vivid\u201d, participants in the MI group \nprovided two ratings, one indicating how vividly they had seen (MI-visual) and the other \nindicating how vividly they had felt (MI-kinaesthetic) the movement. Participants in the SI \ngroup also provided two ratings, indicating the vividness of the actin and myosin filament \nmovement images (SI-cell) and the vividness of the whole-muscle-lengthening images (SI-\nmuscle) respectively. The decision to include separate ratings for visual and kinaesthetic \naspects for the MI group was related to the expectation that more vivid kinaesthetic imagery \nwould result in greater contractile activity, hence in a stronger negative effect on flexibility. \nA similar distinction between visual and kinaesthetic aspects of the images was not made for \nthe SI group, mainly because it was expected that the images of the filament movements \nwould be predominantly visual, and also because we did not want to overload the participants \nwith too many ratings.  In order to assess participants\u201f subjective experiences of the imagery \nconditions, two questionnaires querying them about the content of their imagery, factors \naffecting vividness and perceived impact of imaging, were distributed half way through and \nat the end of the training programme.  \nComfort level \nThe subjectively perceived level of comfort during the stretch was also measured on a nine-\npoint rating scale, ranging from 1 \u201cnot at all comfortable\u201d to  9 \u201cextremely comfortable\u201d.   \nProcedures \nA general introductory meeting was held 10 days prior to the study to inform the participants \nabout the study requirements and to explain the stretches in the flexibility programme. \nParticipants also completed a medical history form. There was no need to exclude \n 10 \nparticipants on medical grounds. All participants agreed to maintain their normal exercise and \nactivity levels for the duration of the study.  \nPre-test flexibility measures were taken approximately one week before the start of the \ntraining programme. Following the flexibility assessment, all participants completed the \nVVIQ, and the participants in the imagery groups received instructions on what to imagine \nduring the stretches. All participants also signed an informed consent form on this day. For \nthe flexibility programme, the three groups then met separately for half an hour, three times a \nweek for a total of 11 training sessions. During the programme, participants were instructed \nto prepare for a stretch by adopting the appropriate stretching position, but to the point where \nthey could not yet feel the stretch. A signal to adopt the stretching position was given five \nseconds before the start of the stretching time. The command \u201cStart now\u201d was given at the \nbeginning of the stretching time. This was an indication for the participants to increase the \nstretching position to the point where a stretch was clearly noticeable, and to start their \nimagery if they were in one of the imagery groups. The last five seconds of stretching time \nwere also announced in all groups. For the participants in the SI group, this was the sign to \nchange their imagery to the image of the whole muscle lengthening. After each stretch (i.e. 7 \ndifferent exercises x 3 repetitions = 21 times), participants in the MI and SI groups rated the \nvividness of their images and participants in all three groups rated the comfortableness of the \nstretch. \nPost-testing was undertaken at the end of the training programme, using the same \nprocedures as for the pre-test. All three groups of participants were post-tested under the \nsame environmental conditions and at the same time of day as their respective pre-tests. To \nmatch pre-test conditions, participants in the imagery groups were asked to refrain from using \nimagery during the stretches (post-test1). Following the sets of active and passive ROM \nmeasurements matching the pre-test conditions, all participants completed a second series of \n 11 \nsets, during which the two imagery groups were required to use their respective imagery \nstrategy (post-test2). Participants in the SI group were told to just use the actin\/myosin \nimages, as the time for the stretch was shorter than during the training programme. After each \nstretch of post-test2, participants again rated the vividness of their imagery. \nAnalyses \nFlexibility scores for both active ROM and passive ROM were calculated for the pre-test, \npost-test1 and post-test2 respectively. The 21 ratings that the participants provided per \nsession for visual vividness and kinaesthetic vividness (MI group) or actin\/myosin vividness \nand whole muscle vividness (SI group) were averaged to determine a mean vividness rating \nper session for MI-visual, MI-kinaesthetic, SI-cell and SI-muscle respectively (\u201csession \nvividness\u201d). A similar procedure was used to calculate mean comfort ratings per session \n(\u201csession comfort\u201d). Overall mean vividness and comfort ratings throughout the programme \nwere also calculated by averaging the mean ratings per session across the 11 sessions \n(\u201coverall vividness\u201d and \u201coverall comfort\u201d).  \nResults \nParticipants \nDuring the course of the study, seven of the 47 volunteers dropped out of the programme for \na variety of personal reasons, including lack of time and injuries sustained in other activities. \nNone of the reasons appeared to be directly related to the programme itself. Of the remaining \n40 participants, flexibility data on 4 participants had to be discarded because it emerged that \nthey had not followed instructions properly. Questionnaire data revealed that 2 participants \nhad done extra exercises at home, despite being asked not to. One participant in the MI group \nhad become bored and stopped doing the imagery in the last week, and one participant in the \n 12 \ncontrol group failed to heed instructions during the post-test, rendering the flexibility \nmeasures invalid.  As a result, data of 36 participants were used, 12 in the MI group, 14 in SI \nand 10 in the control group. There were no significant differences between the three groups in \nage, neither overall (ANOVA, F2, 33 = 0.227, P = 0.789), nor for females (ANOVA, F2, 13 = \n0.080, P =  0.923) or males (ANOVA, F2, 17 = 0.478, P =  0.628). Mean age was 40.4  8.3 \nfor MI, 41.1  11.6 for SI, and 38.3  10.6 for the control group. \n \n**** Table 1 near here ****** \nFlexibility \nMeans and standard deviations for ROM values are presented in Table 1. In order to compare \nthe three groups on pre-test, post-test1 and post-test2 ROM values, two multi-factorial \nrepeated measures ANOVA\u201fs were calculated on active and passive ROM values \nrespectively. Degrees of freedom were adjusted with Greenhouse-Geisser where the \nsphericity assumption was violated (Atkinson , 2001). Both analyses showed significant main \neffects for tests (F1.5, 49.2 =  72.4, P < 0.001, \n2\n = 0.69, for active ROM; F1.2, 38.7 = 64.0, P < \n0.001, \n2\n = 0.66, for passive ROM), but not for groups (F2,33 = 1.49, P = 0.239, \n2\n = 0.08, for \nactive ROM; F2,33 = 1.54, P = 0.230, \n2\n = 0.09, for passive ROM) and no significant \ninteraction effect (F(3, 49.2) = 0.796, P = 0.501, \n2\n = 0.05, for active ROM; F2.4, 38.7 = 0.560, P \n= 0.603, \n2\n = 0.03, for passive ROM).  \nUsing the Least Significant Difference test adjusted with the step-wise Holm-\nBonferroni correction (Atkinson, 2002), follow-up pairwise comparisons were calculated on \nthe differences between tests. These analyses indicated that flexibility measures across all \nthree groups differed significantly between pre-test and post-test1 (P < 0.01, for both active \nand passive ROM), between pre-test and post-test2 (P < 0.01, for both active and passive \n 13 \nROM) and between post-test1 and post-test2 (P < 0.01, for both active and passive ROM). \n(Fig. 1). \n \n**** Figure 1 near here ****** \n \nImagery vividness \nGeneral imagery ability \nThere were no significant differences among the three groups in VVIQ scores (ANOVA, F2, \n33 = 0.046, P = 0.956). Scores in each group ranged from modestly vivid (2.3) to highly vivid \n(4.9). Mean scores were: MI 3.69  0.6, SI 3.71  0.7, Control 3.63  0.7. \nVividness ratings during the programme \nThe overall vividness ratings, taken as an average across all 11 sessions, were: MI-visual 5.99 \n 1.6, MI-kinaesthetic 5.66  1.7, SI-cell 5.30  1.4, and SI-muscle 5.51  1.5. Independent \nand paired t-tests showed that these differences were not significant (p-values ranged from \n0.254 to 0.806 for the independent tests, and were 0.078 and 0.076 for the MI and SI scores \nrespectively).  \nVividness ratings in relation to VVIQ scores \nPearson product moment correlations were calculated between pre-test VVIQ scores and \noverall during-programme vividness ratings. None of the correlations proved significant. \nCorrelation coefficients were r = 0.12 (P =  0.703) for MI-visual; r = 0.25 (P = 0.432) for MI- \nkinaesthetic; r = 0.29 (P = 0.309) for SI-cell; and r = 0.24 (P = 0.406) for SI-muscle.  \n 14 \nFlexibility gain and imagery vividness \nThe relationship between flexibility gain and imagery vividness was examined in several \nways.  Scores were calculated for the percentage increase in ROM from pre-test to post-test1 \n(\u201cprogramme flexibility gain\u201d) and also for the percentage increase in ROM from post-test1 \n(without imagery) to post-test2 (with imagery) (\u201cpost-test flexibility gain\u201d). Programme \nflexibility gain was correlated with both VVIQ scores and overall vividness scores. Post-test \nflexibility gain was correlated with the vividness scores provided for post-test2. To limit the \nnumber of correlations in this analysis, the two types of imagery ratings within each group \nwere combined. This was deemed reasonable, as the average ratings did not differ \nsignificantly and were in fact strongly correlated (ranging between r = 0.87 to r = 0.94 in both \ngroups for overall and post-test vividness).  Because of the directionality of the hypothesis, \none-tailed tests were used. Pearson Product-moment correlations and significance values are \npresented in Table 2.  \n \n**** Table 2 near here ****** \n \nVVIQ and programme flexibility gain \nThere was no significant relationship between VVIQ scores and flexibility gain throughout \nthe programme for any of the groups (Table 2a).  \nOverall vividness ratings and programme flexibility gain \nAll correlations between overall vividness and programme flexibility gain were positive, and \nreached or approached significance for passive flexibility but not for active flexibility (Table \n2b). This partly contradicts the hypothesis that vividness would be negatively related to \nflexibility increase for the MI group and positively for the SI group.  \nPost-test2 vividness ratings and post-test flexibility gain \n 15 \nCorrelations between post-test flexibility gain and vividness ratings for the imagery used on \npost-test 2 revealed significant positive correlations (P < 0.05) for the MI group with both \nactive and passive flexibility gain (Table 2c). The correlations for the SI group were very low \nand negative. \nQuestionnaire results \nThe questionnaire results were used both as intervention check, to ensure that participants \nconformed with the conditions they were assigned to, and as a way to explore the types of \nimages generated by the participants. \nIntervention check \nWith respect to the control group, the questionnaire results indicated that none of the \nparticipants engaged in either movement or stretching imagery. In the MI group, all \nparticipants reported images of their legs moving. Some commented on physical sensations \naccompanying the images, e.g. feeling the muscles relax, increased awareness of thigh \nmuscles, feeling the heel hit the buttock. In the SI group, all participants reported images of \nmuscles stretching. The images they described ranged from mostly literal images to more \npersonally enriched images. Both types of images appeared to be based on the pictures and \nCDROM shown at the beginning of the experiment. \nPerceptions of factors affecting imagery vividness \nWhen asked to indicate in which circumstances their images were most vivid, participants in \nthe MI group predominantly emphasized the absence of external (noise, cold, heat) and \ninternal (worries, preoccupation with work) distractions (64.7% of circumstances cited). \nAlthough these circumstances were also mentioned by the SI group (21.4%), they were less \nprominent. The circumstances mentioned most frequently by the SI group were recalling \npreviously shown pictures of the muscle lengthening (28.6%), and times when the stretch was \n 16 \nfelt very strongly, up to the point of causing pain (28.6%). Other circumstances mentioned \nonce or twice in each group (6-14%) were when the stretch was felt in one isolated area, \nwhen the stretch felt natural or synchronous to the image (in the MI group only), after settling \ninto the exercise, and imaging being elsewhere. \nCombination stretching and imagery \nParticipants varied in their impressions of the effect that the stretching had on their image \ngeneration and vice versa. A little over a third of the participants (MI 33.3%, SI 42.9%) \nthought that doing the stretches while imaging did not make a difference to the ease or \ndifficulty of image generation. Comparable percentages (MI 33.3%, SI 35.7%) thought that \ndoing the imagery would have been easier without stretching at the same time, whereas \nsmaller numbers (MI 26.7%, SI 14.3%) believed that doing the stretches helped in generating \nthe images.  \nSimilar variations were found with regard to the perceived effect of imagery on doing \nthe stretches. About a third of the participants (MI 35.7%, SI 28.6%) thought that the imagery \nhad no effect on the ease of conducting the stretches. Smaller percentages (MI 21.4%, SI \n14.3%) thought that doing the imagery made the stretching harder. A larger proportion of \nparticipants (MI 35.7%, SI 42.9%), on the other hand, thought that doing the imagery \nfacilitated the stretching.  \nPerceived effectiveness of the imagery on enhancing flexibility \nBelief in the effectiveness of the imagery was stronger in the SI than the MI group, as \nindicated by the fact that 61.5% of SI versus 26.7% of MI participants stated that they \nthought the imagery helped considerably or greatly in augmenting the effect of the stretches. \nConversely, 60.0% of MI versus 23.2% of SI participants believed the imagery either made \nno difference or even hindered the effect of the stretching.  \n 17 \nComfort ratings  \nOverall mean comfort ratings were 6.83  1.01 for MI, 5.48  0.93 for SI and 4.16  1.5 for \nthe control group. Univariate ANOVA on these mean comfort ratings revealed significant \ndifferences between groups (F2,33 = 15.2, P < 0.001).  Follow-up post-hoc tests indicated \nsignificant differences between all three groups: P < 0.001 for MI-control, and P < 0.01 for \nMI-SI and SI-control. Observation of the mean comfort ratings per session (Fig. 2) shows that \nthe MI group had consistently higher ratings than both the SI and control group, and that the \nSI group had consistently higher ratings than the control group.  \nComfort ratings were not significantly related to percentage flexibility increase \n(Pearson Product-moment correlation: r = -0.21, P = 0.230 for active ROM; r = -0.04, P = \n0.833 for passive ROM), which suggests that comfort was probably not an indicator of effort \nput into the stretch, or an indicator of the amount of stretching force applied by the \nparticipant during the stretches.  Comfort ratings, therefore, appear to be predominantly an \nindicator of the subjective amount of (dis)comfort experienced during the stretch.  \n \n**** Figure 2 near here ****** \n \nRelationship between comfort and imagery vividness \nTo examine the relationship between levels of comfort experienced and levels of imagery \nvividness, a Pearson-Product Moment correlation was calculated between overall comfort \nratings and overall combined imagery ratings (i.e. a combined score of both imagery ratings \nfor each participant). This resulted in a significant positive correlation (r = 0.56, P < 0.01), \nsuggesting that higher levels of experienced comfort were associated with higher levels of \nimagery vividness. To further explore this relationship, Pearsons correlations were calculated \nseparately for the two groups and the different types of imagery ratings. Positive correlations \n 18 \nwere found ranging from r = 0.51 to r = 0.77; however, after applying a stepwise Holm-\nBonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (Atkinson, 2002), only the relationship \nbetween comfort and MI-combined imagery ratings (r = 0.67, P < 0.05) and the relationship \nbetween comfort and MI-kinaesthetic (r = 0.77, P < 0.01) were found to be significant. \nDiscussion  \nThe main purpose of this study was to examine the influence of movement and stretching \nimagery on flexibility gain during a flexibility training programme. A secondary purpose was \nto explore various aspects of imagery vividness in relation to the requirement of generating \nimages during physical exercise. It was hypothesized that movement imagery would lead to a \nsmaller increase in flexibility than no imagery, while stretching imagery would lead to a \ngreater increase. The results did not support either of these hypotheses. It was clear that the \nflexibility programme resulted in increased ROM, but that the imagery manipulations had \nlittle to no effect on the amount of flexibility gained. If anything, results contradicted \nexpectations.  \nThe hypotheses that more vivid imagers would show the smallest increase in flexibility \nin the movement imagery group and the strongest increase in the stretching imagery group, \nwere also not supported. Contrary to expectations, imagery vividness in the movement \nimagery group showed positive correlations with flexibility gain across the programme, in \nparticular for passive flexibility. In addition, post-test vividness ratings for movement \nimagery showed significant positive correlations with active and passive post-test flexibility \ngain. In the stretching imagery group, correlations between vividness ratings and flexibility \ngain across the programme were in the expected direction and were moderately high, also \nbeing stronger for passive flexibility. They did not reach significance however. Post-test \nvividness for this group showed no relationship with post-test flexibility gain.  \n 19 \nA final result that was contrary to expectations concerned the levels of comfort \nexperienced by the three groups. It was hypothesized that comfort levels would be lowest in \nthe movement imagery group and highest in the stretching imagery group. The results \nshowed, however, that comfort levels in the movement imagery group were significantly \nhigher than in the stretching imagery group, which, in turn, were significantly higher than in \nthe control group. \nThere are a number of questions entangled in the area of purposeful use of mental \nimagery for achieving particular physiological outcomes. One may ask whether the imagery \nactually has a direct physiological effect, as appears to be the case in the Rider et al. studies \n(1989, 1990), or whether it has an indirect physiological effect by influencing other factors \n(e.g. enhanced motivation, better technical execution, improved information processing), or \nwhether perhaps it has no physiological effect at all but is beneficial in a psychological way. \nIt is worth considering the results of this study in light of these questions. \nWith respect to stretching imagery, no clear physiological effect was indicated, more \nor less precluding the need for conjecture regarding the directness or indirectness of such an \neffect. These results are contrary to some other studies which have shown physiological \neffects of physiology-specific imagery (Rider and Achterberg, 1989; Rider et al. 1990; Cupal \nand Brewer, 2001), and this may indicate that the physiological processes involved in \nincreasing flexibility are harder to influence through this type of imagery. On the other hand, \nsome parameters of the present study may have prevented an effect from occurring. It is \npossible, for example, that the vividness of the imagery that the participants were able to \ngenerate was insufficient to produce an effect. One reason for this may be that, although the \npresentation and explanation of the physiological processes in this study were similar to those \nused in the Rider et al. (1989, 1990) studies, the execution of the task was very different in \nthat imagery did not take place under conditions of physical relaxation, nor with the help of \n 20 \naudio-taped imagery instructions. The requirement to combine two different tasks by doing \nthe imagery while stretching may have affected participants\u201f ability to generate the most \nvivid images. This is an intriguing issue, as a number of participants claimed that the \nstretching actually helped them to generate vivid images; for these participants the afferent \ninput provided by the stretch appeared to support the creation of more vivid images. \nConversely, there were also participants who reported that the stretching hindered the \ngeneration of more vivid images.  Hence, the role of afferent input in imagery vividness \ndeserves more exploration in future research.  \nAt the same time, it is worth considering whether the role of specific stretching \nimagery conducted without simultaneous movement and in the absence of physical training \ncould produce an effect on flexibility gain. Conducting imagery in such conditions has been \nshown to increase strength (Yue and Cole, 1992; Smith et al., 2003), although in those studies \nthe imagery used consisted of movement images (i.e. exercising the muscle) rather than \nimages of specific physiological processes.  The latter also points to another interesting issue. \nWhile the concept of imaging specific physiological processes was based on the Rider et al. \n(1989, 1990) studies and work on healing imagery, another possible avenue of achieving \nparticular physiological imagery outcomes may be to focus on the more indirect route of \nimaging behaviours that result in the outcome, rather than on the more direct route of imaging \nthe physiological processes involved in the outcome. Hence, it may also be fruitful to \ninvestigate the effect of imaging the stretching exercises themselves.  \nThe absence of audio-taped guided imagery instructions is another factor that may \nhave contributed to less than optimal imagery vividness. It would likely have become tedious \nto repeat the script for each of the 21 stretches per session, but it is plausible that an imagery \ntraining period preceding the flexibility programme might have been beneficial. Work by \nLang and colleagues (Lang, 1979; Lang et al., 1980) and Smith et al. (2001) has suggested \n 21 \nthat training people by providing them with personalised imagery scripts, especially ones that \nemphasise response propositions (i.e. experiencing physiological, emotional or kinaesthetic \nresponses to the image), can enhance imagery\u201fs effectiveness. Although the imagery \ninstructions to the participants in this study were personalised to make sure that people \nunderstood them, they did not take the form of guided imagery scripts, and this is something \nto be considered in future studies. In this light it is also worth considering emphasising \nresponse propositions in the stretching imagery by encouraging the participants to not only \nsee but also feel the cells and muscles elongating. In keeping with the visual emphasis of the \nphysiology-specific imagery used in other studies, this kinaesthetic element was not \nemphasised in the stretching imagery group, but it is another avenue worth exploring in \nfuture work.  \nIn the movement imagery group, instructions were given to both see and feel the \nmovement, and this was further reinforced by requiring visual as well as kinaesthetic \nvividness ratings to be provided after each of the stretches. The vividness ratings and answers \nto the open-ended questions in the questionnaires confirmed that participants in this group \nincluded response propositions in their imagery. It is nevertheless possible that an initial \ntraining period with guided imagery scripts might have further enhanced levels of vividness.  \nDespite perhaps less than optimal vividness levels, it was evident that the movement \nimagery did not have a negative impact on flexibility increase, implying that the often found \n(e.g. Harris and Robinson, 1986; Jowdy and Harris, 1990; Bakker et al., 1996) direct \nphysiological effect of EMG activity in the muscle during this type of imagery did not \ninterfere with the effect of the stretching exercises. In fact, there were some indications that \nthe movement imagery may have had a positive impact on the stretching. First, more vivid \nmovement imagery was associated with a stronger increase in passive flexibility across the \nprogramme.  Secondly, the post-tests showed a positive correlation between post-test \n 22 \nvividness ratings and percentage increase in active and passive flexibility gain. The latter \nsuggests that vividly imagined sensations of movement may have a beneficial effect on the \nROM achieved during a stretch.  It appears that if participants can create vivid movement \nimagery, this may help them to push the stretch further. A possible mechanism underlying \nthis effect may be found in the subjective reports of some participants in the movement \nimagery group who claimed that the imagery helped the muscles relax. The idea that \nmovement imagery might produce relaxation in the muscle is also supported by some \nanecdotal suggestions in the dance literature. For example, Hanrahan et al. (1995), in \ndiscussing Schweigard\u201fs (1975) work, noted that \u201cappropriate visualized movement in a \nmuscle produces relaxation of this muscle\u201d (p.423). The finding that passive, more so than \nactive, flexibility gain across the programme was related to imagery vividness may be an \nindication that those participants who were able to create vivid movement images throughout \nthe programme also had a better ability to relax during the passive post-test without imagery, \nallowing the ROM to be extended further. \nIn light of the correlational nature of the data, some attention also needs to be given to \nthe possibility that the direction of the relationship could be reversed, i.e. stronger \nkinaesthetic feedback from the physical exercise may enhance the vividness of the imagery. \nThis is an option worth exploring further, in particular in conjunction with the finding that \nsome participants reported that the vividness of their images increased when they felt the \nstretch very strongly. \nAn interesting result of this study concerns imagery\u201fs effect on comfort levels. The \nfinding that both imagery groups differed significantly from the control group in comfort \nsuggests that engaging in imagery may reduce some of the discomfort of the stretching. The \nfact that, in addition, the two imagery groups also differed significantly from each other \nsuggests that there may be an effect of image content over and above an effect of the imagery \n 23 \nitself. This was further reinforced by the significant correlation between comfort and imagery \nvividness, in particular for the movement imagery group and for kinaesthetic movement \nimagery.  That mental imagery can be used as a strategy to reduce discomfort or pain is \ncommonly recognised in the literature on cognitive pain management (e.g. Alden et al., \n2001), where it is often thought that imagery reduces pain perception by acting as a \ndistraction from the pain.  Indeed, in our study several participants in both groups mentioned \nthat the imagery helped because it took the focus away from the discomfort or pain of the \nstretch. At the same time, some other participants indicated that the imagery helped them to \nconcentrate on the stretch. These claims are not necessarily contradictory, as a focus on the \nstretch might mean a focus on the technique of the stretch or the sense of elongation, while \nsimultaneously directing attention away from the pain. Coote and Tenenbaum (1998), who \nconducted a study on imagery use during an exertion tolerance test, found that imagery did \nincrease exertion tolerance but did not reduce exertion perception, leading them to conclude \nthat imagery somehow enabled the participants to better cope with the exertion.  \nWhether the imagery in this study served to reduce pain perception or merely enabled \nparticipants to cope with it better is hard to say, but it was clear that it made the experience \nmore comfortable.  The additional effect of imagery content found for movement imagery \nmay be comparable to some findings from the pain management literature that suggest that \nmere imagery is not sufficient to produce an analgesic effect, but that a particular feeling or \nmeaning needs to be present in the imagery to achieve this (Alden et al., 2001). In the case of \nmovement imagery, considering the fact that kinaesthetic vividness was associated with \ncomfort levels, the critical additional component affecting levels of comfort may have been \nthe quasi-sensory kinaesthetic input that the imagined movement provided. It is plausible that \nthe information processing circuits and\/or brain structures involved in movement imagery \nmay override, interfere or interact with the circuitry involved in processing sensory feedback \n 24 \nfrom the physical exertion of stretching. Future research may address the precise role of this \ninteraction. All in all, despite the more intuitive appeal of stretching imagery (as confirmed \nby the fact that more participants in the stretching imagery group thought their imagery \nwould be effective), it appears that the movement imagery may in fact have had more \nadvantages.  \nA note must be made with regard to general and specific measures of imagery \nvividness. Whereas general indicators of imagery ability like the VVIQ have often been \nfound to be related to the effectiveness of physiologically orientated imagery\n \n(Sheikh et al., \n1989), this was not the case in this study. The VVIQ was not significantly associated with \nflexibility increase, neither was it predictive of during-programme vividness levels. Use of \nthe VVIQ was partly based on the assumption that both movement and stretching imagery \nwould be at least visual in nature. Since the movement imagery also included a kinaesthetic \ncomponent, however, it seems reasonable to speculate that a more movement-specific \ninventory like the MIQ (Hall and Pongrac, 1983; Hall and Martin, 1997) or VMIQ (Isaac et \nal., 1986) might have allowed better predictions, at least for the MI group.  On the other hand, \nthe fact that the VVIQ scores showed little relationship to even the visual vividness scores \nreported during the programme may also suggest that the stretching added a qualitatively \ndifferent dimension to the imagery that affected vividness levels and perhaps tapped into \ndifferent aspects of imagery ability  \nThis study was the first to examine the effect of imagery during stretching. As such, it \nwas difficult to predict effect sizes. Although some experiments with imagery and \nphysiological outcome measures have found fairly large effect sizes that produced significant \noutcomes with sample sizes of 18 (Yue and Cole,1992) or 30 (Smith et al., 2003), the effect \nsizes for the physiological effects in this study were very small (\n2\n values varied from 0.03 to \n0.05; adequate power to detect such small effect sizes as significant would require sample \n 25 \nsizes of around 250 participants, Buchner et al., 1997).  At the same time, the effects of the \nimagery conditions on comfort levels were evident and detectable. This suggests that, while \nthere is insufficient power to conclude that the physiological effects of the imagery \ninterventions were nil, there are clear indications that the psychological effects were \nconsiderably stronger than any physiological effects. As discussed above, it may be possible \nto enhance vividness levels through more extensive and explicit imagery training.  The \npositive correlations between imagery vividness and flexibility gain, especially for movement \nimagery during the post-test, suggest that enhancing imagery vividness may lead to more \npronounced physiological effects, and hence to increased and more easily detectable effect \nsizes. The effects on comfort levels, however, show that even with limited instructions people \nmay derive benefits from engaging in stretching or movement imagery during flexibility \nexercises. \n \nConclusion \nThe results of this study do not support the hypotheses that movement imagery during \nstretching would inhibit the intended effect of the stretches and that stretching imagery would \naugment it. For stretching imagery, the possibility of a direct physiological effect on \nflexibility may be further explored by investigating the use of stretching imagery without \nsimultaneous movement rather than during stretching, by emphasising kinaesthetic sensations \nduring the imagery, or by focusing on imagery of stretching exercises rather than specific \nphysiological processes. For movement imagery, there appears to be no direct negative \nphysiological effect on flexibility, but there are some indications that an indirect positive \neffect may be possible, in the sense that vivid movement imagery might induce relaxation in \nthe muscle which could help in extending the ROM or increasing the duration of the stretch. \nIn the current study the physiological effects were rather small, but there is potential for \n 26 \nenhancing effect sizes by providing more support to produce vivid imagery. The results \nindicate that the psychological effects of the imagery were stronger than the physiological \neffects, as both types of imagery, but movement imagery in particular, produced benefits in \nthe form of enhanced perceived comfort.\n 27 \nReferences \nAlden, A.L., Dale, J.A. and DeGood, D.E.
