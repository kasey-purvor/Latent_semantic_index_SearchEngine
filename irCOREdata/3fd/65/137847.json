Introduction \n \nThe scale of the threat to groundwater quality from diffuse source pollutants has led many \ncountries to develop methodologies to assess the vulnerability of groundwater resources to \nchemical contamination at various scales (e.g. Diaz-Diaz et al. 1999; Holman et al. 2000).  \nGroundwater vulnerability maps, which delineate the land surface according to the potential \nfor pollutants to reach groundwater resources, have been generated using a variety of ranking \nor scoring methods to produce qualitative (e.g. Palmer et al. 1995) or semi qualitative (e.g. \nSecunda et al. 1998) output. These maps usually assess the overall potential for chemical \ncontamination of aquifers and are not specific to individual compounds or classes of \ncompounds (e.g. Aller et al. 1987). Although these maps are useful for supporting policies \nwith regard to the general protection of water resources, they are not suitable for driving \ndetailed monitoring programmes for pollutants. \n \nThe contamination of groundwater by crop protection products leads to expensive treatment \nwhere the water is used for drinking water purposes.  The threat of contamination has \nencouraged the development of techniques to assess the groundwater vulnerability to \npesticide contamination, including semi-empirical methods based upon relationships of a \nlimited number of physical properties with pesticide concentrations (e.g. Shukla et al. 1996; \nTroiano et al. 1999) and more quantitative techniques relating to pesticide movement and \nattenuation.  The latter include analytical solutions of the convection-dispersion equations, \nsuch as the Attenuation and Retardation Factors (Loague et al. 1996; Souter & Musy, 1999) \nand the Leaching Index (Diaz-Diaz et al. 1999), and numerical solutions of the convection-\ndispersion equations (mainly based on PRZM or PRZM2- e.g. Stewart & Loague, 1999; or \nLEACHM- e.g. Souter & Musy, 1999).  Although macropore flow is recognized as an \nimportant transport process for pesticide leaching through a wide range of soils (Brown et al. \n 4\n2000; Flury, 1996), none of the methodologies for evaluating the potential transfer of \npesticides to depth at a large scale incorporates a description of this process.   \n \nThe present paper reports on a methodology for assessing the potential for pesticides to leach \nto groundwater in England and Wales which incorporates a description of preferential flow. \nThe assessment is based on the combination of (i) spatially distributed data, (ii) an emulator \nof the macropore flow model MACRO and (iii) a leaching model for the unsaturated zone.  \n \n2.  Methodology \n \n2.1 Strategy \n \nThe aim of the work reported in the present paper was to develop a diffuse source \ngroundwater pollution module for the Prediction Of Pesticide Pollution In the Environment \n(POPPIE) system.  POPPIE was initially developed to predict pesticide concentrations in \nsurface waters and is used by the Environment Agency of England and Wales for driving and \nrefining pesticide monitoring programmes (Brown et al. 2002). The purpose of the \ngroundwater module is to predict the concentrations of agricultural pesticides reaching the \nwatertable of any groundwater unit in England and Wales likely to be abstracted by small, \nlocally used, wells.  Groundwater is present in almost all geological deposits in these two \ncountries and many locally important groundwater supplies are abstracted from deposits \nclassified as non-aquifers (Palmer et al. 1995).   \n \nDevelopment of the groundwater module for POPPIE was restricted by limitations imposed \nby the necessity to integrate the module into an existing software system. The proposed \nmethodology had to: i) be applicable for all arable areas of England and Wales; ii) utilise \nexisting national spatial databases of climate, soils and their properties, land use, pesticide \n 5\nusage and depth to groundwater held within POPPIE at a 2 km x 2 km resolution; and, iii) be \nable to predict concentrations for most pesticides applied to arable crops in England and \nWales. Given the importance of preferential flow processes in the transport of pesticides to \ndepth in a wide range of soils (Brown et al. 2000; Flury et al. 1995), it was decided to base the \nsoil leaching component of the POPPIE groundwater module on the dual-porosity model \nMACRO (Jarvis, 2002).  MACRO was used to simulate pesticide leaching within the reactive \nsoil zone (ca. the top metre of soil) where most pesticide sorption and degradation occur. \nBelow this, transfer of pesticides within the unsaturated zone was simulated using an \nAttenuation Factor model (Hollis, 1991). Although this latter approach does not account for \npreferential flow, it was still considered appropriate as there is little information on how a \npesticide might behave in the unsaturated zone of a dual porosity and dual permeability \naquifer (Besien et al., 2000) that could support the use of a preferential flow model.  Given \nthe potential importance of preferential flow in chalk aquifers in England and Wales, model \npredictions should be considered to provide a potential for leaching as opposed to quantitative \nestimates.  Running MACRO within the system in real-time was not considered an option \nsince the model has a long run-time. Furthermore, running the model itself would have \nentailed parameterisation for all 412 soil types in the national soil database of England and \nWales, an effort considered to be unnecessary because many of the soils have similar physical \nand chemical properties.  In order to avoid unnecessary detailed parameterization and run-\ntime constraints whilst capitalising on the \u2018state-of-the art\u2019 nature of the model, a meta-\nversion of MACRO (or \u2018MACRO emulator\u2019) was developed.  \n \n2.2 Simulation of pesticide leaching in the reactive zone  \n \nThe MACRO model \n \n 6\nMACRO is a physically-based, macropore flow model, with the total soil porosity divided \ninto two flow domains (macropores and micropores), each characterised by a flow rate and \nsolute concentration (Jarvis, 1994; Jarvis, 2002).  Soil water flow and solute transport in the \nmicropores are modelled using Richards\u2019 equation and the convection-dispersion equation, \nrespectively, whilst fluxes in the macropores are based on a simpler gravity approach with \nmass-flow (Beulke et al., 2001).  Exchange between macropores and micropores is calculated \naccording to approximate, physically-based expressions using an effective aggregate half-\nwidth.  Pesticide degradation is modelled using first-order kinetics whilst sorption is assumed \nto be at instantaneous equilibrium and to be described by a Freundlich isotherm.  The model \nhas been endorsed by the FOCUS working group on leaching (FOCUS, 2000) and is used in \nEurope within the pesticide registration context to assess the leaching potential for \ncompounds to surface waters via drainage and to groundwater. MACRO has been evaluated \nin a significant number of studies (e.g. Jarvis et al. 1994; Vanclooster et al. 2000) and was \nrecommended for use within pesticide registration in a comparative study investigating the \npotential for five preferential flow models to simulate field (Beulke et al. 2001) and lysimeter \n(Beulke et al. 1998) data. Version 4.1 of the model was used in the present study. \n \nSelection of representative MACRO input data \n \nSoil data \n \nParameterisation and run-time constraints prevented the running of the model for all soil \ntypes.  In order to select a limited but valid range of soil types representative of agricultural \nconditions across England and Wales, groupings based on each of the Soil Leaching Potential \nclasses (e.g. H1, H2 etc.) depicted on the Environment Agency\u2019s national series of \ngroundwater vulnerability maps (Palmer et al. 1995) were selected.  Further subdivision (e.g. \nH1a, H1b etc.) of specific classes was made (Table 1) to ensure that each leaching class or \nsub-class contained soils with only a limited range of physical characteristics consistent with \n 7\na single set of MACRO input parameters.  MACRO was parameterised for each of the 10 \nresulting soil leaching classes using soil information data (organic carbon content, bulk \ndensity, particle size distribution, typical soil structure, water retention data) available in the \nnational soil database (Hallett et al. 1995) and expert judgement. Parameters were chosen as \nfollows: the pore size distribution index in the micropores (ZLAMB) was calculated by fitting \nthe Brooks and Corey equation (Brooks and Corey, 1964) to the water release curve; expert \njudgement was used to establish the water tension at the boundary between micropores and \nmacropores (CTEN) as this cannot readily be independently estimated; the water content \nequivalent to this tension (XMPOR) was then derived from the water release curve, whilst the \nconductivity at the boundary (KSM) was estimated from the above values using the equation \ngiven by Laliberte et al. (1968) and Jarvis et al. (1997); the pore size distribution index in the \nmacropores (ZN) was calculated from CTEN using equations built into MACRO_DB (Jarvis \net al., 1997); the saturated hydraulic conductivity was derived using the pedotransfer \nfunctions for soils in England and Wales by Hollis and Woods (1989). Aggregate half-widths \nwere selected from basic descriptions of soil structure using the rules proposed by Jarvis et al. \n(1997).   \n \nClimate \n \nExcess Winter Rain (XWR, the long term average amount of precipitation falling between the \nstart of the Field Capacity season and the end of March less evapo-transpiration) varies from \n<150 to 700 mm in the main arable areas of the UK (Jones & Thomasson, 1985). This range \nwas subdivided into 6 climate classes, each representing between 1.3\u00d7106 and 4.1\u00d7106 ha of \nland (Figure 1).  Long term weather datasets were obtained from a UK Meteorological Office \nweather station in each of the climate classes and single years were selected for each of the \nsix climate classes to give XWR values around the mid point of the range specified (Figure 1) \nand a roughly even distribution of rainfall across the year.  The annual weather data were \nrepeated four times to give a four year leaching period. The length of simulation was selected \n 8\non the basis of computational limitations, but was considered sufficient to allow  the \nmovement of compounds through the soil profile for most of the combinations of pesticide \nparameters used (see below).  \n \nPesticide properties and application data \n \nSensitivity analyses for the MACRO model (Dubus & Brown, 2002) demonstrated that the \ntwo input parameters which most influence model predictions for pesticide loss through \nleaching are generally the sorption distribution coefficient normalised to organic carbon (Koc) \nand the pesticide half-life (DT50), i.e. the time required for a given quantity of compound to \ndegrade by 50%.  Koc values typically range from 1 to >10,000 ml\/g while DT50 values vary \nbetween 1 and >3000 days (Nicholls, 1994). Larger Koc values indicate stronger sorption and \nlarger DT50 values indicate greater persistence. From experience, less mobile compounds \nwith a Koc > ca. 500 ml\/g are only likely to leach to depth if they are also very persistent in \nsoil. However, it is unlikely that compounds with a DT50 > ca. 1 year would be registered for \nuse in agriculture due to their potential to accumulate in soil. Also, compounds with small \nKoc and large DT50 values are not used in modern agriculture because of their undesirable \nenvironmental mobility and persistence. Allowing for these restrictions, DT50 values were \nallow to vary between 2 and 350 days while Koc values ranged from 2 to 500 ml\/g and \nunrealistic combinations of the two parameters were avoided. This resulted in a total of 49 \ncombinations of Koc and DT50 which were used in the modelling (Table 2). The Freundlich \nexponent was set to unity, thereby assuming linear sorption.  Degradation rates in the subsoil \nwere corrected from those in the topsoil using the equation presented by Jarvis et al. (1997) \nwhich assumes that degradation of the compound sorbed is negligible and that the degradation \nrate in solution is proportional to the soil organic carbon. \n \nPesticides were considered to be applied to a winter wheat crop at a rate of 1000 g a.i. \/ha on \n15 October (scenarios involving autumn applied pesticides) or on 15 April (scenarios \n 9\ninvolving spring applied pesticides) in the first year of simulation. No crop interception by the \nwheat crop was considered.  Application dates are representative of management practices in \nthe UK (Hough, 1990). The correction of application dates according to rainfall data around \nthe time of application was considered to be outside the scope of the paper.  Differences \nbetween the different weather scenarios might therefore originate to some extent from the \ntiming of application with respect to rainfall events. \n \nMACRO simulations \n \nSoil leaching classes I2 and L are very organic rich or impermeable, respectively. As such, \nthey have an inherently low pesticide leaching risk and were not considered in the analysis.  \nArable agriculture does not occur in England and Wales in areas with > 700 mm of Excess \nWinter Rain.  Therefore the total number of combinations which were considered in the \nmodelling was 4704, i.e. 49 DT50\/Koc combinations, 48 soil\/climate combinations (8 soils, 6 \nclimates) and a pesticide application in either spring or autumn.  MACRO input files were \ngenerated automatically using the SENSAN software (Doherty, 2000) and daily pesticide \nconcentrations in water percolating at the bottom of the representative profiles were simulated \nby the model over a four-year period. Average annual concentrations were calculated for each \nof the 4 years simulated and the largest of these concentrations was taken.  \n \nMACRO emulator \n \nThe MACRO emulator comprises a series of look-up tables constructed from the results of \nthe 4704 MACRO runs using different input data for soil, weather and pesticide \ncharacteristics.  The tables were indexed by i)  soil leaching potential class; ii)  average \nannual hydrologically effective rainfall (AAHER); iii) season of application (either spring or \nautumn); iv) pesticide half-life; and, v) pesticide sorption distribution coefficient. \n 10\n \nAAHER is derived from weekly values of HER calculated by the \u2018Meteorological Office \nRainfall and Evaporation Calculation System\u2019 (MORECS- Thompson et al. 1981) using daily \nobservational data from the Meteorological Office\u2019s network of weather stations.  Over the \nlong term XWR and AAHER should be similar, but the weekly values of HER within the \nPOPPIE databases allow AAHER to be calculated over time periods different from that of the \nlong term XWR. \n \nUsing the MACRO emulator \n \nFor any pesticide, the look-up tables within the MACRO emulator were used to identify the \nappropriate maximum annual average concentration that relates to the specific soil leaching \nclasses and AAHER of the grid square from the relevant national datasets, and the half-life \nand Koc values of the pesticide.  Where a desired pesticide parameter lay between the values \nin the look-up tables, linear interpolation routines were used to derive appropriate maximum \nannual average concentrations (Appendix 1).  More than one soil type occurs in most of the 2 \nkm x 2 km grid squares in the POPPIE dataset, and a weighted average concentration was \nthus calculated based upon the proportion of each soil in the grid square.   \n \nThe maximum annual average concentrations derived were then linearly scaled to match the \nseasonal pesticide loading using the ratio of the seasonal pesticide loading to the \u2018standard\u2019 \npesticide loading of 1000 g\/ha considered in the MACRO runs.  The seasonal pesticide \nloadings were calculated from monthly loadings (held within the POPPIE database), which \nhad been derived by downscaling regional pesticide usage survey data using 2 km x 2 km \ncropping statistics.  The average \u2018Autumn\u2019 pesticide loading was calculated by summing the \nmonthly pesticide loadings for September to January and dividing by the number of years in \nthe simulation period. Similarly the average \u2018Spring\u2019 pesticide loading is calculated using \nmonthly pesticide loadings for February to August. \n 11\n \n2.3 Simulation of pesticide leaching in the unsaturated zone  \n \nThe Substrate Attenuation Model \n \nCurrent regulatory practice for pesticides is to simulate pesticide leaching through soil at 1 m \ndepth. The predicted concentration at this depth is used as a protective surrogate estimator of \nthe pesticide concentration in groundwater.  Groundwater is deeper than 1 m in most areas of \nEngland and Wales, and the concentration of pesticide in the recharge impacting on a \ngroundwater surface is smaller than that leaving the base of the soil profile due to adsorption, \ndispersion and degradation during transit through the unsaturated zone.  \n \nThe AQUAT model (Hollis, 1991) is used to predict maximum annual average concentration \nimpacting upon the watertable as this model uses the same soil and climate datasets as those \nused in the prediction of pesticide concentrations at 1-m depth. The model applies an \nattenuation factor (AF) to the predicted maximum annual average soil leachate concentrations \nleaving the base of the soil profile derived from the MACRO emulator (Concsoil, in \u00b5g\/l) to \nderive the maximum annual average concentration impacting upon the watertable \n(Concsubstrate, in \u00b5g\/l): \n \nsoilsubstrate ConcAFConc \u2217=  (1) \n \nThe attenuation factor calculates the amount of attenuation that will occur during the \nestimated transit time (in days) of the pesticide in the unsaturated substrate zone (Td), \nassuming a first-order rate constant for degradation: \n \n 12\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n\u2217\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n\u2217\u2212=\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n\u2217\u2212=\nsoil\nsubstrate\ntopsoil\nd\nsubtrate\nd\nDT\nOC\nOC\nT\nDT\nTAF\n50\n693.0exp\n50\n693.0exp  (2) \n \nThe pesticide half-life in the substrate (DT50substrate) is derived by increasing the topsoil half-\nlife (DT50soil) according to the ratio of the topsoil and substrate organic carbon contents \n(OCtopsoil and OCsubstrate, respectively).  This reflects the decrease in pesticide losses due to the \ndecrease in degradation in the substrate resulting from limited microbial activity.   \n \nThe time taken by the pesticide to leach out of the substrate (Td) is estimated from: \nFw\nRfzTd\n100*\u2217\n=  (3) \n \nwhere z is the thickness of the unsaturated zone (m) based on values from an Environment \nAgency dataset within POPPIE, Rf is a retardation factor for pesticide flow (dimensionless) \nand Fw is the unsaturated substrate water flux (cm\/day) or pore water velocity.   \n \nFw is based on the proportion of AAHER (mm) which infiltrates to the saturated zone, \nallowing for runoff.  The proportion is based upon the dimensionless Base Flow Index (BFI) \nwhich is predicted for specific soil types using the empirical analyses of the Hydrology Of \nSoil Types classification (Boorman et al. 1995).  The pore water velocity depends on the \nwater content in the unsaturated zone, which is assumed to be constant throughout the year, \nand represented by the water content at -5 kPa tension (assumed to represent field capacity).  \nHowever, not all the water held in the substrate is available for displacement via piston flow \nas some water will be held at such strong tensions as to be effectively \u2018immobile\u2019. Hence, \nonly the \u2018mobile\u2019 volumetric water fraction, calculated as the volumetric water fraction \n 13\nbetween -5 kPa and -200 kPa tension (\u03b85-\u03b8200) is used when calculating Fw.  Equation (3) then \nbecomes:  \n \n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb \u2217\n\u2212\n=\n10*365\n*100** 2005\nBFIAAHER\nRfzTd\n\u03b8\u03b8\n (4) \n \nThe \u2018retardation factor\u2019 Rf for pesticide flow (Eq. 5) is an index of the retardation of pesticide \nleaching through soils due to sorption (Loague et al. 1996).  Its development derives from soil \nthin-layer chromatography and it is suitable for calculating movement in the unsaturated \nsubstrate zone because we assume that pesticide flow occurs predominantly as bulk matrix \nflow. \n \n[ ] ( )[ ]( )\n( )substratesubstrate\nawsubstratesubstratesubstrateocsubstrate KOCKRf\n15005\n50\n5.0\n01.0\n1\n\u03b8\u03b8\n\u03b8\u03b8\u03c1\n\u2217\u2212\n\u2217\u2212+\u2217\u2217\u2217\n+=  (5) \n \nwhere \u03c1 substrate is the bulk density of the substrate (g\/cm3), 0\u03b8 substrate is the porosity \n(dimensionless), \u03b81500 is the volumetric water content at -1500 kPa tension and Kaw is the \nHenry\u2019s Law constant (dimensionless). \n \nIn this approach, the pesticide is partitioned between the solid, liquid and gas phases by \nadsorption, diffusion and volatilisation as it leaches through porous material. Within the \nunsaturated substrate, the retardation factor is based on pesticide-specific solid\/water and \nwater\/gas partition coefficients calculated from Koc and Kaw values and the substrate water \nand air fractions. The substrate water fraction available for partitioning is assumed to be the \nwater fraction at -5 kPa less half of the water content at -1500 kPa tension (assumed to \nrepresent wilting point), as some of the water is held at tensions that render it unavailable for \n 14\nphysico-chemical interactions.  The substrate air fraction is calculated as the difference \nbetween total volumetric porosity and volumetric water content at -5kPa tension. \n \n3.  Model evaluation and discussion \n \n3.1 MACRO emulator output \n \nExamples of output from the MACRO emulator are shown in Figures 2 to 4 for a range of \npesticide physico-chemical properties, soil types, climate and application timing.  The relative \nvulnerability to leaching was found to be significantly influenced by all factors considered in \nthe approach (i.e. soil class, climate class, pesticide properties and timing of application). The \nlarge sensitivity of the MACRO emulator to the two pesticide parameters (Figure 2) is similar \nto that described for the MACRO model (Dubus & Brown, 2002).  The largest concentrations \nwere predicted for the soils which are prone to by-pass flow (soil classes H1a and I1c) (Figure \n3). Increasing AAHER generally caused greater leaching up to a maximum value (Figures 3 \nand 4) above which the greater volume of leaching water diluted pesticide loadings, thereby \nresulting in a decrease in the predicted average concentration.   \n \n3.2  Evaluation of the MACRO emulator using lysimeter data  \n \nData for two sets of lysimeter studies investigating the leaching of isoproturon, linuron, \ndichlorprop and bentazone (Bergstr\u00f6m et al. 1994; Brown et al. 2000) were compared to \npredictions from the MACRO emulator (Tables 3 and 4). The appropriate soil leaching class \nwas estimated from the lysimeter soil data and the AAHER was estimated from the measured \naverage amount of annual percolation.  Pesticide concentrations were calculated by the \nMACRO emulator for the appropriate soil class, AAHER, published half life and Koc and \napplication season (autumn for the UK data and spring for the Swedish data).  Finally, the \n 15\npredicted concentrations were corrected for the actual application rates used in the studies \n(Tables 3 and 4) and converted to overall leachate loads using the measured drainage volumes \nfrom each lysimeter.   \n \nThe MACRO emulator was found to predict leaching qualitatively (i.e. successful predictions \nof leaching in 10 out of 12 lysimeters for which positive detections of pesticide were reported \nand the absence of pesticide leaching in the three lysimeters which showed no pesticide \ndetection) although quantitative estimates were only within an order of magnitude of \nconcentrations measured in the lysimeters for 2 of the lysimeters presented in Tables 3 and 4.  \nThis may be attributed to: i) the fact that MACRO runs that were undertaken did not \nincorporate a lysimeter bottom boundary condition and ii) the lack of soil-specific \nparameterisation of MACRO for the lysimeters. Preferential flow was found by Jarvis et al. \n(1994) to have a stronger influence on pesticide loss in the lysimeters with the Mellby and \nNantuna sands (Table 4) than would be expected on the basis of the texture of these two soils. \nAlso, these authors have emphasised that an underestimation of concentrations measured in \nthe five Swedish lysimeters is likely if modelling is undertaken using generic sorption and \ndegradation data derived from the literature. Furthermore, for the UK lysimeters, the Ludford \nlysimeters were not representative of the H1a soil class, whilst the MACRO model itself \nunder-predicts losses from the Enborne lysimeters (Beulke et al. 1998). \n \n3.3 Evaluation of the modelling system linking the MACRO emulator and AQUAT \nusing national monitoring data \n \nA limited evaluation of the POPPIE groundwater module was carried out for pesticides \ndetected in groundwater in the UK, using national scale monitoring data collected by the \nEnvironment Agency (Department of the Environment, Transport and Regions, 1998).  \nCompounds were selected to cover a range of detection frequencies (common to infrequent), \n 16\nspatial application patterns (national to regional) and crops. The chosen compounds were \nisoproturon (only registered for use on cereals), atrazine (registered for use on maize and until \n31 August 1993 for non- agricultural uses), lindane (formerly registered for application to \ncereals, grass, brassicas, fruit and for non- agricultural uses) and chlorotoluron (registered for \nuse on cereals). \n \nThe linked MACRO emulator \/ AQUAT system was operated within the bespoke POPPIE \nGIS at a 2 km x 2 km resolution since soil, climate and pesticide application datasets within \nPOPPIE are available at this resolution (Brown et al. 2002).  Figure 5 presents predicted \nmaximum annual average concentrations of atrazine and isoproturon which are likely to \nimpact upon groundwater in England and Wales, using climate and seasonal pesticide loading \ndata for the period 1993-96 inclusive. Predicted atrazine concentrations were greatest in the \nsouth-west of England as would be expected from its primary agricultural usage in continuous \nforage maize cultivation.  Out of the four compounds considered, predictions for isoproturon \nwere the most spatially widespread, in accordance with its extensive usage with a wide range \nof cereals and its common detection in groundwater (Department of the Environment, \nTransport and Regions, 1998).   \n \nTable 5 shows the predicted numbers (and percentages) of 2 km by 2 km grid squares in \nEngland and Wales falling into classes of maximum average annual pesticide concentration. \nData on the annual percentage of samples from public water supply boreholes with pesticide \nconcentration >0.1 \u00b5g\/l are also provided. The comparison of these two types of data is \nlimited to some extent. First, the measured data are point samples in time (rather than annual \naverage concentrations). Secondly, the measured data give a proportion of samples, rather \nthan a proportion of boreholes sampled (the number of samples will differ between \nboreholes). Thirdly, the relatively coarse grid size used in this study (2 km x 2 km) allows the \nlarger concentrations from \u2018hot spots\u2019 to be diluted by lower concentrations from other soils \nin the grid square.  Also, the model cannot predict pesticide contamination resulting from \n 17\npoint or linear source applications, such as from non-agricultural usage on railways, \nwoodland and amenity areas and pesticide disposal, spillage or sprayer \u2018washings\u2019.  For \nexample, almost all herbicides applied to the West German railways were detected in nearby \ngroundwater samples (Schweinsberg et al. 1999). Finally, the model cannot incorporate site-\nspecific factors, such as pesticide runoff from adjacent impermeable strata and abstraction- or \nflood-induced infiltration of surface waters containing pesticide concentrations into \ngroundwater.  \n \nThis paper has described the first attempt at integrating preferential flow into the evaluation \nof the potential for groundwater contamination from pesticides.  Further research and \nrefinement of the modelling concept presented are required to address the main outstanding \nlimitations.  These include that a preferential flow model was not used to simulate water and \nsolute flow in the unsaturated zone, the crop in MACRO was not adjusted to crop growth \nstage, application dates were not adjusted to rainfall data and there was no integration of \ndetailed information on the unsaturated zone of aquifers. \n \nWith these limitations in mind, it can be considered that the linked MACRO emulator \/ \nAQUAT system successfully predicted the relative order of pesticide leaching to groundwater \nfor the compounds studied.  Poor predictions for atrazine were attributed to the significant \nnon-agricultural usage of the compound in the UK prior to 1993. Overall, the first-step \nevaluation exercise described in the present paper suggested that the system developed was \nindicative of the likely potential for transfer of pesticides to groundwater and that the system \ncould be used for its intended purpose, i.e. the refinement and targeting of pesticide \nmonitoring programmes. \n \n4.  Conclusions \n \n 18\nPesticides are one of the few groups of diffuse source pollutants for which statutory water \nquality standards exist.  As such it is desirable for regulators to be able to target groundwater \nmonitoring systems to those localities where exceedences may occur on the basis of \nquantified predictions.  All existing spatial modelling systems for pesticide leaching which \nprovide quantified predictions are based on analytical or numerical solutions of the \nconvection-dispersion equation.  However, given the importance of preferential (or by-pass) \nflow processes in the transport of pesticides to depth in a wide range of soils, new \nmethodologies are required which can account for by-pass flow within a spatial context. \n \nThe development and first-step evaluation of an integrated modelling system for predicting \nlikely concentrations of agricultural pesticides leaching to the watertable throughout England \nand Wales is described.  The integrated system links the interpolated results from more than \n4000 simulations with the mechanistic, dual porosity, soil leaching model MACRO (the \nMACRO emulator) with an attenuation factor model for the unsaturated zone.  \n \nIn a evaluation exercise against data for pesticide leaching from two sets of lysimeter studies, \nthe MACRO emulator simulated pesticide loss in 10 of 12 lysimeter soil-pesticide \ncombinations for which pesticide leaching was shown to occur and also successfully \npredicted no loss from 3 soil-pesticide combinations.  However, the MACRO emulator tends \nto under-estimate the measured data.  Evaluation against a wider range of soils is \nrecommended to assess whether further subdivisions of the existing 10 soil leaching potential \nclasses are required to improve predictions. \n \nThe system comprising the MACRO emulator and AQUAT was tested against national \nmonitoring data for the presence of pesticides in UK aquifers. The current system uses \nspatially-weighted averages to predict concentrations in grid squares with more than one soil \ntype.  This allows the larger concentrations from \u2018hot spots\u2019 to be diluted by lower \nconcentrations from other soils in the grid square.  Given the problems associated with \n 19\ncomparing measured data with predicted average annual concentrations, the model \nsuccessfully predicted the relative magnitude and regional patterns of leaching to groundwater \nof all 4 compounds selected for national study.  Nevertheless, it is recommended that \nimproved resolution datasets of soil types and pesticide application rates are incorporated.  \n \nIt is considered that within the constraints imposed by the resolution of the data and the scale \nof operation, both the MACRO emulator and the system linking the MACRO emulator and \nthe AQUAT model satisfactorily predicted the likelihood of pesticide leaching in the two \nsimple evaluation exercises reported. This provides a first-step evaluation of the system which \nis to be used for the targeting and refinement of regional groundwater monitoring systems for \nthe presence of pesticides in groundwater. Use of the system is likely to lead to an \nimprovement in the cost-effectiveness of measures needed to ensure the \u201cgood status\u201d of \ngroundwater quality as required by the Water Framework Directive. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the funding of this study by the Environment Agency of \nEngland and Wales (project reference E1-066).
