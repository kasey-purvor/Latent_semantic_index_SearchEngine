There are numerous, often conflicting\nconsiderations to bear in mind. For instance, we would\nlike our interconnection topology to be symmetric, have a\nsmall diameter, be recursively decomposable, be highly\nconnected, be regular of low degree, support rapid and easy\ninterprocessor communication, support the simulation of\nother machines based on other topologies, and so on. There\ndoes not exist an interconnection topology that is optimal\non all accounts, and trade-offs generally have to be made.\nAn extremely popular interconnection topology is the\nhypercube. The hypercube has been used as the interconnec-\ntion topology of a number of distributed-memory multi-\nprocessors suchas theCosmicCube [19], theAmetekS\/14 [4],\nthe iPSC [9], [10], the Ncube [5], [10], and the CM-200 [6], and\nthe properties of hypercubes relevant to parallel computing\nhave been well studied. One drawback of the hypercube is\nthat as the dimension of a hypercube increases, so does the\ndegree of its nodes. Consequently, given a collection of\nprocessors, if we wish to connect these processors in the\ntopology of a hypercube, then we have no choice as to the\ndegree of thenodes of the resultingnetwork. The k-ary n-cube\nhas been proposed as an alternative to the hypercube. The\nk-ary n-cube is very \u201chypercube-like\u201d andhas similar proper-\nties to the hypercube. Furthermore, the two parameters\navailable, k andn, allowus to regulate the degree of the nodes\nyet still incorporate large numbers of processors, although\nusually at a cost to some other property such as the diameter\nor the connectivity. A number of distributed memory multi-\nprocessors have been built with a k-ary n-cube forming the\nunderlying topology, such as theMosaic [20], the iWARP [7],\nthe J-machine [18], the Cray T3D [14], and the Cray T3E [3].\nAs more and more processors are incorporated into\nparallel machines, faults become more common, be it faults\nin the processors themselves or faults on the interprocessor\nconnections. Given the significant cost of parallel machines,\nwe would prefer to be able to tolerate small numbers of\nfaults and still be able to use our parallel machine. A key\nproperty we would like our \u201cfaulty\u201d machine to have is that\na large number of the healthy processors should remain in a\nconnected component and be able to undertake significant\nparallel computations. Numerous existing algorithms for\nk-ary n-cubes utilize the orderings of processors and involve\nthe use of long paths and cycles (note that a path in a\nmultiport bidirectional network results in a closed path\ncontaining the nodes of the path exactly twice), and we\nwould wish to utilize such structures even in the presence\nof faults. Also, fundamental and abundant in parallel\ncomputing are linear arrays and rings of processors, and\nat the very least, our faulty machine should be able to\nsimulate (the large number of) algorithms designed for\nmachines whose processors are joined in the form of linear\narrays or rings (see, for example, [2] and [16]). We remark\nthat our situation is of a different nature to that where a\nfaulty network is to simulate another (healthy) network but\nwhere this simulation comes about due to an embedding of\nthe healthy network in the faulty network with low load,\ncongestion, and\/or dilation (such a scenario can be found\nin, for example, [1], [8], [12], and [17], where hypercubes,\narrays, and butterflies are considered).\nIn this paper, we continue the study of the k-ary n-cube\nwith regard to the existence of long paths and cycles in the\npresence of limited numbers of node and link faults. We are\nmotivated by the work in four recent publications. In [15],\nKim and Park study the existence of Hamiltonian paths in\ntwo-dimensional tori. They provide conditions when a two-\ndimensional torus with at most two faulty nodes is\nHamiltonian, Hamiltonian-connected, and bi-Hamiltonian\nconnected. In [11], Fuproves that ann-dimensionalhypercube\nwith f \u0003 n\u0004 2 faulty nodes is such that there is a path of\nlength at least 2n \u0004 2f \u0004 \u0002 between any two distinct healthy\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS, VOL. 19, NO. 8, AUGUST 2008 1071\n.

In [13], Hsieh and Chang show that Fu\u2019s\nresult holds even when f \u0003 2n\u0004 5 but only so long as every\nhealthy node is adjacent to at least two healthy nodes (the so-\ncalled conditional fault assumption). In [22], Yang et al.\nproved that in a k-ary n-cubewhere k is odd, if the number of\nfaulty nodes and links is at most 2n\u0004 3, then there is a\nHamiltonian cycle, and if the number of faulty nodes and\nlinks is at most 2n\u0004 2, then there is a Hamiltonian path\njoining any two distinct healthy nodes. Note that Yang et al.\nprove no results when k is even beyond remarking that when\nk is even, the k-ary n-cube is bipartite, and so, if there is one\nfaultynode, then there canbenoHamiltonian cycle, and there\nexists a pair of distinct healthy nodes not joined by a\nHamiltonian path.\nOur main result is given as follows: Let k \u0002 4 be even\nand let n \u0002 2. In a faulty k-ary n-cube Qkn in which the\nnumber of node faults fn and the number of link faults fe\nare such that fn \u00fe fe \u0003 2n\u0004 2, given any two healthy\nnodes s and e of Qkn, there is a path from s to e of length\nat least kn \u0004 2fn \u0004 1 (respectively, kn \u0004 2fn \u0004 2) if the nodes\ns and e have different (respectively, the same) parities. Our\nresult resolves the situation in [22] when k is even, answers\nthe questions posed by Yang et al. and by Fu, and extends\nknown results, obtained by Kim and Park, for the case when\nn \u00bc 2. The rest of this paper is devoted to a proof by\ninduction of our main theorem. Section 2 contains the basic\ndefinitions. In Section 3, we deal with the base case of the\ninduction, and in Section 4, we deal with the inductive step.\nWe present our conclusions in Section 5.\n2 BASIC DEFINITIONS\nThe k-ary n-cube Qkn, for k \u0002 3 and n \u0002 2, has kn nodes\nindexed by f0; 1; . . . ; k\u0004 1gn, and there is a link\n\u00f0\u00f0u1; u2; . . . ; un\u00de, \u00f0v1; v2; . . . ; vn\u00de\u00de if and only if there exists\nd 2 f1; 2; . . . ; ng such that minfjud \u0004 vdj; k\u0004 jud \u0004 vdjg \u00bc 1\nand ui \u00bc vi, for every i 2 f1; 2; . . . ; ng n fdg. Many structural\nproperties of k-ary n-cubes are known, but of particular\nrelevance for us is that a k-ary n-cube is node symmetric;\nthat is, given any two distinct nodes v and v0 of Qkn, there is\nan automorphism of Qkn mapping v to v\n0. Throughout, we\nassume that the addition of tuple elements is modulo k.\nAn index d 2 f1; 2; . . . ; ng is often referred to as a\ndimension. We can partition Qkn over dimension d by fixing\nthe dth element of any node tuple at some value v, for\nevery v 2 f0; 1; . . . ; k\u0004 1g. This results in k copies\nQd;0; Qd;1; . . . ; Qd;k\u00041 of Qkn\u00041 (with Qd;v obtained to fix\nthe dth element at v), with corresponding nodes in\nQd;0; Qd;1; . . . ; Qd;k\u00041 joined in a cycle of length k (in\ndimension d). Such a partition proves to be extremely\nuseful (in proofs by induction, as we shall see).\nThe parity of a node v \u00bc \u00f0v1; v2; . . . ; vn\u00de of Qkn is defined to\nbe\nPn\ni\u00bc1 vi modulo 2. We speak of a node as being odd or\neven according to whether its parity is odd or even. A pair of\nnodes fv;v0g is odd (respectively, even) if v and v0 have\ndifferent (respectively, the same) parities.\nWe write paths in Qkn as sequences of incident links, and\nwhen k is even, paths necessarily consist of links joining,\nalternatively, odd and even nodes. We often refer to a\npath as \u0003\u00f0u;v\u00de; the notation denotes that this is a path\njoining node u and node v. On occasion, we might refer to a\nlink \u00f0x;y\u00de as appearing on a path \u0003\u00f0u;v\u00de or, equivalently,\nthe path \u0003\u00f0u;v\u00de as containing the link \u00f0x;y\u00de; when we do,\nthe notation denotes that if we traverse the path \u0003\u00f0u;v\u00de\nstarting at node u, then we shall reach node x immediately\nbefore we reach node y. If \u0003\u00f0u;v\u00de is a path and x and y are\nnodes on this path, then \u0003\u00f0x;y\u00de denotes the subpath of\n\u0003\u00f0u;v\u00de starting at x and ending at y.\nA fault in Qkn refers to a faulty node or a faulty link. If a\nnode is faulty, then we imagine that the node and its\nincident links do not exist; if a link is faulty, then we\nimagine that this link does not exist. When we refer to a\npath in a faulty Qkn, we mean that all nodes and links on\nthe path should be nonfaulty, that is, healthy (unless\notherwise stated).\nWe repeatedly apply the following construction through-\nout. Suppose that we have partitioned a k-ary n-cube Qkn\nover some dimension d so as to obtain k-ary \u00f0n\u0004 1\u00de-cubes\nQd;0; Qd;1; . . . ; Qd;k\u00041 and that we have a path \u0003\u00f0u;v\u00de in Qkn of\nlength l. Suppose also that \u00f0xi;yi\u00de is a link of \u0003\u00f0u;v\u00de, with\nxi, yi 2 Qd;i and that we have another path \u00030\u00f0xi\u00fe1;yi\u00fe1\u00de of\nlength l0 that shares no nodes in common with \u0003\u00f0u;v\u00de,\nwhere xi\u00fe1 and yi\u00fe1 are the neighbors of xi and yi,\nrespectively, in Qd;i\u00fe1. We refer to the path obtained by\nremoving the link \u00f0xi;yi\u00de from \u0003\u00f0u;v\u00de and replacing it with\nthe path \u00f0xi;xi\u00fe1\u00de, \u00030\u00f0xi\u00fe1;yi\u00fe1\u00de, \u00f0yi\u00fe1;yi\u00de, so as to obtain a\nnew path from u to v of length l\u00fe l0 \u00fe 1, as the join of\n\u0003\u00f0u;v\u00de to \u00030\u00f0xi\u00fe1;yi\u00fe1\u00de over \u00f0xi;yi\u00de. We can equally well join\ntwo paths over a subpath rather than a link; with the above\nnotation, we would remove a subpath \u0003\u00f0xi;yi\u00de from \u0003\u00f0u;v\u00de\nand replace it with the path \u00f0xi;xi\u00fe1\u00de, \u00030\u00f0xi\u00fe1;yi\u00fe1\u00de,\n\u00f0yi\u00fe1;yi\u00de. We have analogous constructions should we wish\nto join a cycle and a path to obtain a path or two cycles to\nobtain a cycle (when joining a cycle, we lose one edge from\nthe cycle).\nHenceforth, for reasons of clarity, we drop the use of\nbold type to denote the nodes of Qkn (hitherto, we have used\nbold type to emphasize the representation of nodes as\ntuples of elements).\n3 THE BASE CASE\nIn this section, we deal with the base case of our\nforthcoming inductive proof of the main result, namely,\nwhen we have a k-ary 2-cube with no more than two faults.\nWe begin with some notation specific to our constructions\nin this section.\nWe consider Qk2 as a k\u0005 k grid with wraparound, and we\nthink of a node vi;j as indexed by its row i and column j.\nGiven two row indices i, j 2 f0; 1; . . . ; k\u0004 1g, where j 6\u00bc i,\nwe define the row torus rt\u00f0i; j\u00de to be the subgraph of Qk2\ninduced by the nodes on rows i, i\u00fe 1; . . . ; j if i < j or\nrows i; i\u00fe 1; . . . ; k\u0004 1; 0; . . . ; j if j < i but with all column\nlinks between nodes on row j and nodes on row i removed\nif i \u00bc j\u00fe 1 or (i \u00bc 0 and j \u00bc k\u0004 1). Throughout, we assume\nthat the addition of row or column indices is modulo k.\nWe define the following paths in the row torus rt\u00f00; 1\u00de\n(of some Qk2). The names of these paths are derived from the\nshape of their pictorial representations (see the figures\ncoming up).

For every even\ni 2 f0; 1; . . . ; p\u0004 2g, build the following cycle Ci:\n\u00f0vi;0; vi;1\u00de; \u00f0vi;1; vi;2\u00de; . . . ; \u00f0vi;k\u00042; vi;k\u00041\u00de; \u00f0vi;k\u00041; vi\u00fe1;k\u00041\u00de;\n\u00f0vi\u00fe1;k\u00041; vi\u00fe1;k\u00042\u00de; . . . ; \u00f0vi\u00fe1;1; vi\u00fe1;0\u00de; \u00f0vi\u00fe1;0; vi;0\u00de:\nJoin the cycle C0 to the cycle C2 over the links \u00f0v1;0; v1;1\u00de and\n\u00f0v2;0; v2;1\u00de and denote the resulting cycle by E0;0. Now, join\nE0;0 to the cycle C4 over the links \u00f0v3;0; v3;1\u00de and \u00f0v4;0; v4;1\u00de\nand denote the resulting cycle by E0;0 also. Proceed in this\nway to obtain the Hamiltonian cycle E0;0 of the row torus\nrt\u00f00; p\u0004 1\u00de rooted at v0;0.\nIf 3 \u0003 p \u0003 k\u0004 1 is odd, then build the cycle E0;0 in the\nrow torus rt\u00f00; p\u0004 2\u00de and join it to the cycle induced by the\nnodes on row p\u0004 1 over the links \u00f0vp\u00042;0; vp\u00042;1\u00de and\n\u00f0vp\u00041;0; vp\u00041;1\u00de. Denote the resulting cycle as the cycle E0;0\nof rt\u00f00; p\u0004 1\u00de rooted at v0;0. The Hamiltonian cycle E0;0 in\nrt\u00f00; 6\u00de in Q72 can be visualized as in Fig. 5.\nNote that we also have the Hamiltonian cycles E0;i of\nrt\u00f00; p\u0004 1\u00de, for all p 2 f2; 3; . . . ; kg and i 2 f1; 2; . . . ; k\u0004 1g,\nobtained by starting the above process at the root node v0;i\nas opposed to node v0;0.\nProposition 5. Consider the k-ary 2-cube Qk2, where k \u0002 6 is\neven and where there is one faulty link. Let s and e be any\ntwo distinct nodes in the row torus rt\u00f00; p\u0004 1\u00de, where\n2 \u0003 p \u0003 k. There is a path in rt\u00f00; p\u0004 1\u00de from s to e of\nlength pk\u0004 1 (respectively, pk\u0004 2) if fs; eg is odd (respec-\ntively, even).\nProof. By Lemma 2, we may assume that the faulty link lies\nin rt\u00f00; p\u0004 1\u00de. Without loss of generality, we may assume\nthat the faulty link is either \u00f0va;0; va\u00fe1;0\u00de or \u00f0va;0; va;1\u00de,\nwhere 0 \u0003 a \u0003 p\u0004 2. As before, \u0002 \u00bc 1 if fs; eg is odd, and\n\u0002 \u00bc 2 if fs; eg is even.\nCase a. a \u00bc 0, and the faulty link is \u00f0v0;0; v1;0\u00de.\nSubcase a.1. s and e lie on row 0.\nIf s \u00bc v0;i and e \u00bc v0;j, then without loss of generality,\nwe may assume that i < j and that it is not the case that\ni \u00bc 0 and j \u00bc k\u0004 1.\nSuppose that it is not the case that i \u00bc 1 and j \u00bc k\u0004 1.\nLet \u00030\u00f0s; e\u00de be the path\n\u00f0s; v0;i\u00041\u00de; \u00f0v0;i\u00041; v0;i\u00042\u00de; . . . ; \u00f0v0;j\u00fe1; e\u00de:\nNote that the length of \u00030\u00f0s; e\u00de is odd if and only if fs; eg\nis odd, so there are an even number of nodes on row 0\nthat are not on \u00030\u00f0s; e\u00de if and only if fs; eg is odd. Let C\nbe the cycle induced by the nodes on row 1. Iteratively\njoin C to appropriate links \u00f0v0;l; v0;l\u00fe1\u00de over \u00f0v1;l; v1;l\u00fe1\u00de so\nthat the nodes used on row 0 do not already appear on\n\u00030\u00f0s; e\u00de. Links should be replaced (by paths) so that if\nfs; eg is odd (respectively, even), then every node of\nrt\u00f00; 1\u00de appears on the (amended) cycle C or on \u00030\u00f0s; e\u00de\n(respectively, except one). Join \u00030\u00f0s; e\u00de to C over two\ncorresponding links (this is always possible) and denote\nthe new path by \u0003A\u00f0s; e\u00de. The path \u0003A\u00f0s; e\u00de has length\n2k\u0004 \u0002. This construction can be visualized in Fig. 6,\nwhere the dashed links show how \u00030\u00f0s; e\u00de is joined to the\namended C.\nSuppose that i \u00bc 1 and j \u00bc k\u0004 1. Let \u00030\u00f0s; e\u00de be\nthe path\n\u00f0s; v0;2\u00de; \u00f0v0;2; v0;3\u00de; . . . ; \u00f0v0;k\u00042; e\u00de:\nLet C be the cycle induced by the nodes on row 1. Join\n\u00030\u00f0s; e\u00de to C over \u00f0v0;1; v0;2\u00de and \u00f0v1;1; v1;2\u00de and denote the\nnew path by \u0003A\u00f0s; e\u00de. The path \u0003A\u00f0s; e\u00de has length 2k\u0004 2.\nIf p \u00bc 2, then we are done. If p > 3, then let D be the\nHamiltonian cycle E2;0 in the row torus rt\u00f02; p\u0004 1\u00de, and if\np \u00bc 3, then let D be the cycle induced by the nodes on\nrow 2. Join \u0003A\u00f0s; e\u00de to D over two corresponding links,\nand the resulting path is as required.\nSubcase a.2. s lies on row 0, and e lies on row 1.\nLet s \u00bc v0;i and e \u00bc v1;j; without loss of generality, we\nmay assume that i 6\u00bc k\u0004 1. If i 6\u00bc 1, then let e0 be a\nneighbor of s on row 0 that does not lie in the same\ncolumn as e. If i \u00bc 1 and j 6\u00bc 2, then let e0 \u00bc v0;2.

However, when k \u00bc 4,\na simple computer program (implementing an exhaustive\nsearch) verifies that Propositions 3, 4, 6, and 7 all still hold\n(we leave this verification as an exercise). Hence, we have\nthe following result.\nTheorem 8. Let k \u0002 4 be even. In a faulty k-ary 2-cube Qk2 in\nwhich the number of node faults fv and the number of link\nfaults fe are such that fv \u00fe fe \u0003 2, given any two healthy\nnodes s and e of Qk2, there is a path from s to e of length at least\nk2 \u0004 2fv \u0004 1 (respectively, k2 \u0004 2fv \u0004 2) if the nodes s and e\nhave different (respectively, the same) parities.\n4 THE INDUCTIVE STEP\nIn this section, we complete the proof by induction of our\nmain theorem. The following lemma simplifies the situation\nconsiderably.\nLemma 9. LetQkn have 2n\u0004 2 faulty nodes and links,wheren \u0002 4.\nThere exists a dimension d such that when we partitionQkn over\ndimension d, the resulting k-ary \u00f0n\u0004 1\u00de-cubes Qd;0; Qd;1; . . . ;\nQd;k\u00041 each contain at most 2n\u0004 4 faulty nodes and links.\nProof. Suppose, as our induction hypothesis, that n \u0002 5 and\nthat the result holds for Qkn\u00041 (with 2n\u0004 4 faults). Let Qkn\nhave 2n\u0004 2 faults. Partition Qkn over dimension 1; if\nthe resulting k-ary \u00f0n\u0004 1\u00de-cubes Q1;0; Q1;1; . . . ; Q1;k\u00041 are\nsuch that each contains at most 2n\u0004 4 faults, then we are\ndone. Therefore, without loss of generality, suppose that\nQ1;0 contains 2n\u0004 2 or 2n\u0004 3 faults.\nSuppose thatQ1;0 contains 2n\u0004 3 faults, and so, there is\nexactly one fault not in Q1;0. Temporarily regard some\nfault, w, say, of Q1;0 as healthy and apply the induction\nhypothesis to Q1;0 (note that wmight be a node or a link).\nThus, there is a dimension d such that when we partition\nQ1;0 over dimension d, the resulting k-ary \u00f0n\u0004 2\u00de-cubes\neach contain atmost 2n\u0004 6 faults. Consequently,whenwe\npartition Qkn over dimension d, each of the resulting\nk-ary \u00f0n\u0004 1\u00de-cubes contains at most 2n\u0004 4 faults (the\n\u201ctemporarily healthy fault\u201d w needs to be recast as faulty,\nand there is one other fault not in Q1;0 to consider).\nSuppose that Q1;0 contains 2n\u0004 2 faults, and so, there\nare no faults outside Q1;0. Temporarily regard two faults,\nw and w0, say, of Q1;0 as healthy and apply the induction\nhypothesis to Q1;0. Thus, there is a dimension d such that\nwhen we partition Q1;0 over dimension d, the resulting\nk-ary \u00f0n\u0004 2\u00de-cubes each contain at most 2n\u0004 6 faults.\nConsequently, when we partition Qkn over dimension d,\neach of the resulting k-ary \u00f0n\u0004 1\u00de-cubes contains at most\n2n\u0004 4 faults (the two \u201ctemporarily healthy faults\u201d w and\nw0 need to be recast as faulty).\nIn order for the result to follow by induction, all we\nneed to do is to verify the statement of the lemma for\nwhen n \u00bc 4. Let the faults of Qk4 be wi, for i \u00bc 1; 2; . . . ; 6.\nPartition Qk4 over dimension 1. Either each resulting k-ary\n3-cube contains at most four faults, and we are done, or\nthe nodes involved in at least five of fwi : i \u00bc 1; 2; . . . ; 6g\nhave identical first components (if wi is a link, then the\nnodes involved in wi are the nodes of the link, and if wi is\na node, then the node involved in wi is the node itself).\nWe may assume that it is the latter and that the five faults\nwhose first components (of the nodes involved) are\nidentical are w1, w2, w3, w4, and w5.\nPartition Qk4 over dimension 2. Either each resulting\nk-ary 3-cube contains at most four faults, and we are\ndone, or one of the resulting k-ary 3-cubes contains either\nfive or six faults. We may assume that the second\ncomponents of w1, w2, w3, and w4 are identical.\nPartition Qk4 over dimension 3. Either each resulting\nk-ary 3-cube contains at most four faults, and we are\ndone, or one of the resulting k-ary 3-cubes contains either\nfive or six faults. We may assume that the third\ncomponents of w1, w2, and w3 are identical.\nPartition Qk4 over dimension 4. Either each resulting\nk-ary 3-cube contains at most four faults, and we are\ndone, or one of the resulting k-ary 3-cubes contains either\nfive or six faults. We may assume that the fourth\ncomponents of w1 and w2 are identical. This yields a\ncontradiction as either w1 and w2 are nodes, and w1 6\u00bc w2,\nor w1 or w2 is a link joining a node to itself. The\nresult follows. tu\nLet us reexamine the proof of Lemma 9. Ideally, we\nwould like Lemma 9 to apply when n \u00bc 3, but the argument\nin the proof fails. However, we can classify exactly the fault\nconfigurations leading to failure.\nSuppose that Qk3 has four faulty nodes. Following\nthrough the argument in the proof of Lemma 9 yields that\nup to isomorphism, the situations where the argument fails\nis when the four faults are of the form \u00f00; 0; 0\u00de, \u00f0a; 0; 0\u00de,\n\u00f00; b; 0\u00de, and \u00f00; 0; c\u00de, for some a, b, and c all different\nfrom zero.\nSuppose that Qk3 has three faulty nodes and one faulty\nlink. Without loss of generality, suppose that the faulty\nlink lies in dimension 1. Following the argument in\nLemma 9 yields that up to isomorphism, the situations\nwhere the argument fails is when the three faulty nodes\nare of the form \u00f00; 0; 0\u00de, \u00f00; b; 0\u00de, and \u00f00; 0; c\u00de, for some b\nand c different from zero, and the faulty link is of the\nform \u00f0\u00f0a; 0; 0\u00de; \u00f0a\u00fe 1; 0; 0\u00de\u00de, for some a.\nSuppose thatQk3 has two faulty nodes and two faulty links.\nWithout loss of generality, suppose that one of the faulty\nlinks lies in dimension 1 with the other in dimension 2\n(the two links cannot lie in the same dimension, as otherwise,\nwe could partition over this dimension and be done).\nFollowing the argument in Lemma 9 yields that up to\nisomorphism, the situations where the argument fails is\nwhen the two faulty nodes are of the form \u00f00; 0; 0\u00de and \u00f00; 0; c\u00de,\nfor some c different from zero, and the faulty links are of\nthe form \u00f0\u00f0a; 0; 0\u00de; \u00f0a\u00fe 1; 0; 0\u00de\u00de and \u00f0\u00f00; b; 0\u00de; \u00f00; b\u00fe 1; 0\u00de\u00de,\nfor some a and b.\nSuppose that Qk3 has one faulty node and three faulty\nlinks. Without loss of generality, suppose that one of the\nfaulty links lies in dimension 1, one in dimension 2, and\none in dimension 3.

In this case, Lemma9\nholds, as at least two faulty links lie in the same dimension,\nand we can partition over this dimension. We shall use these\nobservations in the proof of the following theorem.\nThroughout the rest of the paper, we adopt the\nfollowing notation. Suppose that we partition Qkn over some\ndimension d to get the k-ary \u00f0n\u00041\u00de-cubes Qd;0;Qd;1; . . . ;Qd;k\u00041.\nLet x be a node ofQd;i, say. Then, we refer to the node inQd;j\ncorresponding to x (that is, the node of Qd;j whose name is\nidentical to that of x except that its dth component is j as\nopposed to i) as xj. We also refer to the node x as xi.\nTheorem 10. Let Qkn be a k-ary n-cube, for some n \u0002 2 and some\neven k \u0002 4, with fv faulty nodes and fe faulty links, where\n0 \u0003 fv \u00fe fe \u0003 2n\u0004 2. If s and e are distinct healthy nodes\nand fs; eg is odd (respectively, even), then there exists a path\nfrom s to e of length at least kn \u0004 2fv \u0004 1 (respectively,\nkn \u0004 2fv \u0004 2).\nProof. We proceed by induction on n. The base case of the\ninduction is handled by Theorem 8. Suppose, as our\ninduction hypothesis, that the result holds for Qkm, where\nn \u0002 3, and for all m < n. Let Qkn be a k-ary n-cube as in\nthe statement of the theorem. Throughout, \u0002 \u00bc 1 if fs; eg\nis odd, and \u0002 \u00bc 2 if fs; eg is even.\nSuppose that n \u0002 4. By Lemma 9, we may assume that\nwhen we partition Qkn over dimension 1, the resulting\nk-ary \u00f0n\u0004 1\u00de-cubes Q1;0; Q1;1; . . . ; Q1;k\u00041 each contain at\nmost 2n\u0004 4 faults. Suppose that the number of faulty\nnodes in Q1;i is fi, for i \u00bc 0; 1; . . . ; k\u0004 1.\nCase a. s and e lie in Q1;0.\nBy the induction hypothesis, there is a path \u00030\u00f0s; e\u00de in\nQ1;0 of length at least k\nn\u00041 \u0004 2f0 \u0004 \u0002. Let \u00f0w0; z0\u00de be a link of\n\u00030\u00f0s; e\u00de for whichw1 and z1 are healthy nodes (ofQ1;1) and\n\u00f0w0; w1\u00de and \u00f0z0; z1\u00de are healthy links (a simple counting\nargument shows the existence of such a link). By the\ninduction hypothesis, there is a path \u00031\u00f0w1; z1\u00de in Q1;1 of\nlength at least kn\u00041 \u0004 2f1 \u0004 1.

Hence, we may assume\nthat Q1;0 contains three faulty nodes. However, if we\nfollow exactly the constructions in each of Cases c, d, e,\nand f, then these constructions still apply, and we obtain\na path of the required length. Exactly the same can be\nsaid of the scenarios when we have two and three faulty\nlinks. The result now follows. tu\nWe note that givenQkn, where k \u0002 4 is even, and fn and fe,\nwhere fn \u00fe fe \u0003 2n\u0004 2, there are configurations of fn faulty\nnodes, fe faulty links, and pairs of distinct healthy nodes so\nthat the longest path joining the two nodes has length exactly\nkn \u0004 2fn \u0004 1 (respectively, kn \u0004 2fn \u0004 2) if the parities of the\ntwo nodes are different (respectively, the same). Hence, in\nthis sense, our result can be viewed as optimal.\nAlso, there are configurations of 2n\u0004 1 faulty nodes inQkn\nand pairs of healthy nodes such that the longest path joining\nthe two nodes has length one; take healthy adjacent nodes x\nand y where all other neighbors of x are faulty. Hence, the\ntotal number of faults in Theorem 10 cannot be increased.\n5 CONCLUSIONS\nTheorem 10, allied with the result in [22], fully resolves the\nsituation regarding the existence of longest cycles in\nk-ary n-cubes where the total number of faults (nodes and\nlinks) is at most 2n\u0004 2 and where the faults are configured\nin a \u201cworst case\u201d scenario with respect to the pair of nodes\nin question. Of course, there are configurations of, for\nexample, 2n\u0004 2 faulty nodes in Qkn where certain pairs of\nnodes have paths joining them of lengths strictly greater\nthan the bounds stated in Theorem 10. It would be\ninteresting to build the longest paths joining pairs of nodes\nbut taking into account the configuration of faults (though\nthis would appear to be a demanding task).\nWe expect that if we assume the conditional fault\nassumption, then we should be able to tolerate more faults\nyet still prove a result analogous to Theorem 10. It would be\nworthwhile to investigate this scenario, and we conjecture\nthat the path lengths will be exactly as in Theorem 10.\nThe existence of paths and cycles in (faulty) interconnec-\ntion networks does not guarantee that we can efficiently\nconstruct these paths and cycles using a distributed\nalgorithm implemented on the underlying topology (see\n1084 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS, VOL. 19, NO. 8, AUGUST 2008\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Durham.
