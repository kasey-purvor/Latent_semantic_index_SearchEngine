Relative to the 8- and 11-year-olds, the 5-year-olds \nfalsely recognized fewer critical lures when the DRM stimuli were presented in lists, \nbut falsely recognized more critical lures when the stimuli were presented in stories. \nLevels of false recognition in the 8- and 11-year-olds were not affected by study \nformat. We argue that the story context enhanced the ability of the 5-year-olds to \nmake inferences based on the theme of the DRM stimuli. The 5-year-olds then \nshowed higher levels of false recognition than the older children owing to their \ninability to reject lure words consistent with the stories.  \n 2 \nIn the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) procedure (Deese, 1959; Roediger \n& McDermott, 1995), participants are presented with lists of semantic associates of a \nword that is not itself presented. For example, participants hear words such as bed, \nrest, awake, tired, and dream, which are associates of the nonpresented word sleep. In \nsubsequent tests of recall or recognition, sleep (the critical lure) is often erroneously \nidentified as having been presented in the study list. Roediger and McDermott \ndeveloped an activation-monitoring account of the DRM illusion. According to this \naccount, participants spontaneously generate semantic associates of the words \npresented in the study lists. For example, participants who hear bed, rest, awake, etc, \nspontaneously generate the associated word sleep. When later asked to retrieve the \nstudy lists, the participants are unable to distinguish between the words they heard \nand those they generated in response. \nAlthough the DRM procedure consistently produces false memories in adults, \nrecent research has shown that it is less effective in eliciting false memories in \nchildren. For example, Brainerd, Reyna, and Forrest (2002) found that false recall \nwas at near-floor levels in 5- and 7-year-olds, while false recognition was reduced in \n5-year-olds relative to 11-year-olds and young adults. The absence of a DRM effect \nin children is surprising given that they are particularly prone to memory distortion \n(e.g., Brainerd & Reyna, 1996; Ceci, Crotteau, Smith, & Loftus, 1994) and have \nrelatively poor source monitoring skills (Foley, Johnson, & Raye, 1983).  \nBrainerd et al. (2002) interpreted their findings in relation to fuzzy trace \n 3 \ntheory (FTT; Brainerd & Reyna, 1996; Reyna & Brainerd, 1995, 1998). According to \nFTT, participants in memory experiments create two traces of study items: a gist trace \nthat preserves the meaning of an item, and a verbatim trace that includes surface \ndetails of the item and its encoding context. According to Brainerd et al., the critical \nlures are falsely remembered because of their overlap with the gist traces of the \nstudied items. They argued that the DRM procedure is ineffective with children \nbecause they fail to notice that the words in a list are semantically related and do not \ncreate the gist traces that are responsible for the DRM effect.  \n In contrast to the findings of Brainerd et al. (2002), Dewhurst and Robinson \n(2004) found that the DRM procedure can elicit false memories in children. However, \nthe false memories they observed were qualitatively different from those typically \nproduced by adults. Dewhurst and Robinson\u2019s results suggested a developmental shift \nfrom phonological to semantic false memories. Whereas 11-year-olds falsely recalled \nwords that were semantically related to the study items, 5-year-olds falsely recalled \nwords that rhymed with the study items. It is therefore not the case that the DRM \nprocedure is ineffective with children, but rather that the nature of the false memories \nproduced by the DRM procedure changes with age. Nevertheless, the 5-year-olds \ntested by Dewhurst and Robinson still produced relatively few semantic intrusions, \nthereby supporting the proposal by Brainerd et al. (2002) that young children fail to \ncreate gist memories representing the semantic themes of the lists.   \nDespite their relative immunity to the standard DRM illusion, young children \n 4 \nhave been found to be susceptible to semantically-driven false memories when asked \nto remember more complex linguistic materials, such as sentences and stories (see \nOakhill & Cain, 2004, for a review). For example, Paris and Carter (1973) found that \n7- and 10-year olds falsely recognized sentences that were consistent with the \nmeaning of other sentences previously read out to them, and Brown, Smiley, Day, \nTownsend, and Lawton (1977) found that children aged 8 years and older falsely \nrecognized lure sentences that were congruent with a previously heard story.  \nFindings such as these show that children make inferences and associations that are \nconsistent with the overall meaning of a passage of text. If this is the case, it should \nbe possible to increase young children\u2019s susceptibility to the DRM illusion by \npresenting the DRM stimuli in the context of a story that highlights their overall \ntheme.  \nIn order to investigate this, we created a series of short stories based on 8 \nDRM lists and presented them to 5-, 8-, and 11-year-olds. Our sample therefore \nincluded children younger than those tested by Paris and Carter (1973) and Brown et \nal. (1977), allowing us to investigate developmental changes in susceptibility to story-\nbased memory illusions. The broader age range also allowed comparison with \nprevious DRM studies, which included 5-year-olds. Half the children in each age \ngroup heard the stories and were given tests of recognition memory for the DRM \nstimuli (including the critical lures) after each story. The remaining participants heard \nthe DRM stimuli in the standard list format and were similarly tested for recognition \n 5 \nmemory after each list.  \nBrainerd et al. (2002) found that the false recognition of critical lures was \nlower in 5-year-olds than in 11-year-olds and young adults. In contrast, Ghetti, Qin, \nand Goodman (2002) found that false recognition was not influenced by age. \nHowever, they also found that false recall decreased with age, with 5- and 7-year-olds \nfalsely recalling more critical lures than adults when overall levels of recall were \ncontrolled. As noted by Ghetti et al., their use of relatively short study lists (7 items \nrather than the usual 12 or 15) may have reduced the levels of false recall and false \nrecognition in adult participants, which were much lower than in Brainerd et al.\u2019s \nstudy. The longer lists used in the present study enabled us to investigate whether the \ndevelopmental increase in susceptibility to the DRM illusion is found in recognition \nas well as in recall.  \nAccording to FTT, the absence of a DRM effect in 5-year-olds is due to their \ninability to identify the themes of the DRM stimuli when presented in lists. \nEmbedding the DRM stimuli in a story that emphasizes their overall theme should \ntherefore increase 5-year-olds\u2019s susceptibility to the illusion. Predictions regarding \nthe effects of stories on the 8- and 11-year-olds are less clear. However, given that the \nability to form gist representations increases developmentally, it is possible that the \nstory context will have less of an effect on the 8- and 11-year-olds, who are already \nable to connect the gist of the DRM stimuli when they are presented in lists. The \ngreater ability of the 8- and 11-year-olds to use verbatim traces to reject critical lures \n 6 \nmay also restrict any increase in false recognition beyond the levels produced by lists. \nOur prediction therefore was that the story context would lead to a significant \nincrease in false recognition for the 5-year-olds, but a smaller increase (or no \nincrease) in false recognition for the 8- and 11-year-olds. \nMethod \nParticipants. Sixty children (31 girls and 29 boys) were recruited from two \nschools in Caernarfon, Wales. There were twenty 5-year-olds, twenty 8-year-olds, \nand twenty 11-year-olds. All were fluent English speakers with no reported language \ndifficulties. Ten children in each age group were presented with the standard DRM \nlists and ten were presented with the DRM stimuli in stories.  \nStimuli and Design. Eight DRM lists were selected from Roediger and \nMcDermott (1995) and consisted of semantic associates of the following critical \nlures: sleep, smell, doctor, lion, fruit, thief, music, and cold. Each study list contained \n14 associates of the critical lure, presented in descending order of associative \nstrength. A fifteenth word that was highly associated to the critical lure was omitted \nfrom each study list to serve as a second critical lure in the recognition test. Eight \nstories were written, each based on a single DRM list (see Appendix for a sample \nstory).  The stories ranged in length from 65 to 104 words and included the 14 DRM \nwords presented, as far as possible, in the same order as they appeared in the list \ncondition (in the few cases where this was not possible the order of the words in the \nList condition was altered to match the Story condition). Each recognition test \n 7 \nconsisted of the 14 studied DRM words, the two critical lures, and 5 unrelated words \ntaken from other DRM lists not used in the study. A between-groups design was \nemployed, with the two factors of Age (5, 8, or 11 years) and Study Format (lists or \nstories).  \nProcedure. The children were tested individually by a female experimenter \n(the second author). They were told that the experimenter would read aloud a series \nof words (or stories) and that after each one they would be given a memory test for \nsome of the words they heard. In the list condition, the words were read aloud in \ndescending order of associative strength at a rate of one every two seconds. After \neach list, the experimenter read aloud a second series of words and asked the \nparticipants to indicate whether they thought the word had appeared in the list they \njust heard by saying \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d. They were told to say yes only if they were certain \nthe word had definitely appeared. This procedure was repeated until all eight DRM \nlists had been presented and tested. The procedure for the story condition followed a \nsimilar schedule. The stories were read aloud by the experimenter and took between \n30 and 40 seconds per story to deliver. Each story was followed by the same \nrecognition test as was used in the corresponding list condition.  \nResults \nThree scores were calculated for each child: The number of words correctly \nrecognized, the number of critical lures falsely recognized, and the number of \nunrelated lures falsely recognized. These scores were analyzed in a series of 3x2 (Age \n 8 \nx Study Format) between-groups Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Effect sizes \nmeasured by partial eta-squared (\u03b7p2) are also given. Table 1 shows the mean \nproportions of hits and false alarms as a function of Age and Study Format.  \nPLEASE INSERT TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE \nAs expected, correct recognition showed a significant main effect of Age, F \n(2, 54) = 8.37, MSE = 147.95, p < .001, \u03b7p2 =  .24. Table 1 shows that correct \nrecognition increased steadily across the three age groups. The main effect of Study \nFormat was marginally significant, F (1, 54) = 3.18, MSE = 147.95, p = .08, \u03b7p2 = \n .06, and showed higher levels of correct recognition for the Story format than for the \nList format. These effects were qualified by a significant interaction between Age and \nStudy Format, F (2, 54) = 4.35, MSE = 147.95, p < .05, \u03b7p2 =  .14. This was explored \nin a series of post-hoc comparisons (Tukey tests). Comparisons across Study Format \nshowed that correct recognition in the 5-year-olds was higher in the Story condition \nthan in the List condition, p < .01, but was not reliably affected by Study Format in \nthe 8- and 11-year-olds. Comparisons across Age showed that correct recognition was \ngreater in the 11-year-olds than the 5-year-olds in the List condition, p < .001, and \ngreater in the 11-year-olds than the 8-year-olds in the Story condition, p < .05. No \nother differences were significant.  \nOur main focus was on the effects of Age and Study Format on the false \nrecognition of critical lures. The main effect of Age was not significant, F < 1. \nHowever, a significant main effect of Study Format was observed, F (1, 54) = 4.54, \n 9 \nMSE = 5.31, p < .05, \u03b7p2 =  .08, with children in the Story condition falsely \nrecognizing more critical lures than children in the List condition. This was qualified \nby a significant interaction between Age and Study Format, F (1, 54) = 10.00, MSE = \n5.31, p < .001, \u03b7p2 =  .27. Post-hoc comparisons across Study Format showed that the \n5-year-olds falsely recognized more critical lures in the Story condition than in the \nList condition, p < .001, while Study Format did not reliably affect the 8- or the 11-\nyear-olds. Post-hoc comparisons across Age showed that, in the List condition, the \nfalse recognition of critical lures was greater in the 8- and 11-year-olds than in the 5-\nyear-olds, p < .05. The 8- and 11-year-olds did not differ reliably. In contrast, the \nfalse recognition of critical lures in the Story condition was greater in the 5-year-olds \nthan in the 8- and 11-year-olds, p < .05. Again, the 8- and 11-year-olds were not \nreliably different.  \nThe false recognition of unrelated lures showed a significant main effect of \nAge, F (2, 54) = 6.01, MSE = 17.14, p < .01, \u03b7p2 =  .18, and decreased as the age of \nthe children increased. The main effect of Study Format was not significant, F (1, 54) \n= 1.12, MSE = 17.14, p = .29, \u03b7p2 =  .02. The interaction between Age and Study \nFormat bordered on significance, F (2, 54) = 3.13, MSE = 17.14, p = .05, \u03b7p2 =  .10. \nPost-hoc comparisons across Study Format showed that the 5-year-olds falsely \nrecognized more unrelated lures in the List than in the Story format, p < .05, whereas \nthe 8- and 11-year-olds were not reliably affected by Study Format. Comparisons \nacross Age showed that the 5-year-olds falsely recognized more unrelated lures than \n 10 \nthe 11-year-olds in the List condition, p < .001. No other differences were significant.  \nDiscussion \nThe main finding from the present study is that the susceptibility of 5-year-\nolds to the DRM illusion was increased when the DRM stimuli were presented in the \ncontext of a story. When the DRM stimuli were presented in the standard list format, \n5-year-olds falsely recognized significantly fewer critical lures than either the 8- or \nthe 11-year-olds. When the stimuli were presented in stories, the 5-year-olds falsely \nrecognized significantly more critical lures than the older age groups. The present \nfindings are therefore consistent with the conclusion by Brainerd et al. (2002) that \nyoung children are not susceptible to the standard DRM illusion because they fail to \nform a gist representation of the list theme. Presenting the DRM stimuli in a context \nthat highlights their overall theme increases 5-year-olds\u2019 susceptibility to the illusion.  \nThis conclusion is reinforced by the finding that the false recognition of \nunrelated lures by the 5-year-olds was greater in the list condition than in the story \ncondition. According to Brainerd et al. (2002), the inability of young children to \nconnect the gist of the DRM stimuli leads then to produce high numbers of intrusions \nthat are unrelated to the list theme (see Dewhurst & Robinson, 2004, for similar \nfindings). The finding that the 5-year-olds made fewer false alarms to unrelated items \nin the story condition confirms that the story context made it easier for them to \nidentify the theme. As a result, they made associations consistent with the overall \ntheme of the story rather than the ad hoc associations to individual items that 5-year-\n 11 \nolds typically make when the DRM stimuli are presented in lists. The finding that the \n5-year-olds in the story condition made fewer false alarms to unrelated lures also \nrules out the possibility that the increase in false recognition of critical lures in the \nstory condition was due to a response bias.  \nIf the story contexts led the 5-year-olds to make inferences based on an \noverall representation of a story,  it is somewhat suprising that the stories did not \nincrease false recognition in the 8- and 11-year-olds, as the ability to construct a \nrepresentation of a story has been shown to improve with age (e.g., Ackerman, 1986, \n1988; Barnes, Dennis, & Haefele-Kalvatis, 1996). One explanation that can be ruled \nout is that the null effect of story contexts in the older children is due to the relatively \nsmall sample sizes. As can be seen in Table 1, both the 8- and the 11-year-olds falsely \nrecognized more critical lures in the List condition than in the Story condition. The \nfinding that stories did not increase false recognition in the older children may reflect \na combination of two factors: the greater ability of older children to form gist \nrepresentations of the DRM stimuli in list format, and developmental improvements \nin the ability to use verbatim traces to monitor memory processes at retrieval \n(Brainerd & Reyna, 1996; Reyna & Brainerd, 1995, 1998).  \nThe present findings therefore highlight the complex interaction between \nencoding and retrieval processes that determines susceptibility to the DRM illusion. \nYoung children are not susceptible to the standard DRM illusion because they fail to \nconnect the gist of the words at encoding. Presenting the stimuli in a story context \n 12 \nallows children as young as 5 years of age to use higher-level inferences to connect \nthe gist. In contrast, 8-and 11-year-olds are able to connect the gist when the DRM \nstimuli are presented in lists (though not necessarily as successfully as adults) and are \ntherefore more susceptible to the illusion than 5-year-olds. However, once the gist of \nthe DRM stimuli has been identified, 5-year-olds show greater susceptibility to the \nillusion than older children because they are less able to use verbatim traces to reject \nthe critical lures at retrieval.  \nThis explanation can also be couched in terms of the activation-monitoring \naccount of the DRM illusion proposed by Roediger and McDermott (1995). In these \nterms, young children lack the semantic knowledge to identify the themes of the \nDRM lists and therefore fail to generate the critical lures. When the themes are made \nsalient by the story contexts, 5-year-olds can make the associations that give rise to \nthe illusion. They are then more likely than older children to falsely recognize the \ncritical lures because of their relatively poor source monitoring skills. Thus, although \nthe associative processes that lead to the DRM illusion develop with age, their effect \nis offset by developmental increases in the accuracy of the monitoring processes that \ninhibit false memories.  \nTo summarize, the present study showed that 5-year-olds are less likely than \n8- and 11-year olds to falsely recognize critical lures in the DRM procedure when the \nstimuli are presented in lists, but more likely than 8- and 11-year olds to falsely \nrecognize critical lures when the stimuli are presented in stories. The format in which \n 13 \nthe DRM words were studied did not reliably influence levels of false recognition in \nthe 8- and 11-year-olds. These findings indicate that the DRM procedure can be \neffective with young children when the stimuli are presented in a context that \nemphasizes their overall theme, and suggest that age-related differences in \nsusceptibility to the DRM illusion are the result of developmental changes in both the \nrepresentations formed at encoding and the strategies available at retrieval. \n 14 \nReferences \nAckerman, B.P.
