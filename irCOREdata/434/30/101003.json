Various authors\nhave reported investigations of coplanar CVD diamond de-\ntectors as a tissue equivalent radiation dosimeter, and have\ndemonstrated an x-ray photocurrent sensitivity similar to that\nof silicon photodiodes. The unique properties of diamond are\nwell suited for this application, including extreme radiation\nhardness, high resistivity, and good charge transport. How-\never the development of practicable diamond x-ray detectors\nhas been restricted by a combination of priming effects and\nslow time response, or photocurrent persistence. These ef-\nfects are due to a complex interplay between bulk trapping\ncenters inherent in CVD material and the nature of the metal-\ndiamond ohmic contacts used to fabricate the devices. In this\nwork, we describe the performance of a coplanar x-ray sen-\nsor fabricated using a metal-less graphitized contact which\nwas produced using a high dose implantation of boron ions.\nThe interdigitated electrode structure was produced using\nonly graphitized diamond, patterned by ion implantation\nthrough a photoresist.\nTwo coplanar diamond devices were fabricated, using\nfree-standing 70 \u0002m thick undoped polycrystalline CVD\ndiamond film grown by Element Six Ltd. Device 1 consisted\nof a single coplanar electrode structure, with an electrode\nwidth and interelectrode gap of 100 \u0002m. The contacts were\nfabricated by a conventional photolithographic lift-off pro-\ncess, using thermally evaporated chromium \u000150 nm\u0002 fol-\nlowed by gold \u0001200 nm\u0002. After lift off, the sample was an-\nnealed for 10 min at 400 \u00b0C in a nitrogen atmosphere to form\na metal-carbide contact. Device 2 was fabricated using ion\nimplantation with no metal contact. Prior to implantation, a\n2.5 \u0002m thickness photoresist was spun onto the diamond and\npatterned using a conventional optical mask. The mask de-\nsign was divided into four quadrants, containing four copla-\nnar devices with a central common electrode and with elec-\ntrode widths and interelectrode gaps of 5 \u0002m, 10 \u0002m,\n20 \u0002m, and 50 \u0002m \u0001Fig. 1\u0002. A broad beam ion implantation\nwas applied to the device at room temperature using 70 keV\nboron ions and a dose of 2\u00011016 cm\u22122. After removal of the\nphotoresist in acetone, the device was annealed for 4 min at\na\u0002Electronic mail: p.sellin@surrey.ac.uk\n0003-6951\/2005\/87\u00029\u0001\/093502\/3\/$22.50 87, 09350\nDownloaded 30 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject to700 \u00b0C in a nitrogen atmosphere that resulted in a graphitic\ncoplanar electrode structure. The measurements reported\nhere for Device 2 were obtained from the quadrant with\n20 \u0002m electrode spacing. After annealing, wire connections\nwere made to the graphite electrodes using silver paint.\nThe x-ray photocurrent response of the two devices was\ncharacterized using a 30 kV x-ray tube, operated at a maxi-\nmum beam current of 500 \u0002A. All measurements were taken\nat a bias voltage of 300 V. Without x-ray irradiation, the\nmeasured dark currents were 1 nA and 0.2 nA for Devices 1\nand 2, respectively. X rays were then applied using different\nbeam currents in the range of 100\u2013500 \u0002A, with the beam\npulsed on and off with a pulse duration of approximately 1\nmin. The corresponding dose rate received by the device was\nmeasured simultaneously using a calibrated ion chamber, and\nwas in the range of 0.4\u20132.0 mGy\/s. Figure 2 shows the\npulsed photocurrent data obtained from Device 1 with met-\nallized contacts. The data show a linear increase in photocur-\nrent as a function of dose rate, reaching a photocurrent of\n0.07 \u0002A at 2 mGy\/s. Photocurrent persistence can be clearly\nobserved in the data, with the current taking a finite time to\nreach a maximum value after each x-ray pulse is switched\non. A similar effect is observed each time the pulse is\nswitched off, with the photocurrent decaying exponentially\nwith a time constant of several minutes.\nThe data in Fig. 2 also show an increase in photocurrent\nwhen Device 1 is illuminated with white light. At a dose rate\nFIG. 1.

Extrinsic photoconductiv-\nity may be due to various processes, including thermal ion-\nization of states in the band gap or indirect phonon-assisted\ntransitions to the conduction band. In our work, no attempt\nwas made to suppress the extrinsic photocurrent sensitivity\nby using additional surface treatments.\nFigure 3 shows the corresponding x-ray photocurrent\ndata obtained from Device 2, fabricated using the metal-less\ngraphitized contacts. The data show a linear increase in pho-\ntocurrent as a function of dose rate, consistent with that ob-\ntained from Device 1, as shown in Fig. 4. The sensitivity of\nthis device is 7.6 \u0002C\/Gy, for photons with a peak energy of\n30 keV, corresponding to a sensitivity per unit volume of\n12 \u0002C\/ \u0001Gy mm3\u0002. Similar photocurrent performance and\nsensitivity data were also obtained for the graphitized device\nwith 50 \u0002m electrode spacing.\nA significant difference in performance between the\nmetal contact and graphitized contact devices can be ob-\nserved in terms of the photocurrent persistence. The graphi-\ntized device shows a prompt rise and fall of the photocurrent,\nfollowing the time dependence of the x-ray pulses, and there\nis no evidence of any long time constant in the photocurrent\nFIG. 2.

Pulsed x-ray photocurrent from Device 2, fabricated using graphi-\ntized contacts.\nDownloaded 30 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject tobehavior. A very prompt initial overshoot in the photocurrent\nis observed due to the resistance\/capacitance time constant of\nthe measurement circuit. When each x-ray pulse is switched\noff, the photocurrent returns immediately to the dark current\nvalue \u00010.2 nA\u0002, and maintains this value after the irradiation\nsequence. Both devices were fabricated from CVD material\nof comparable quality, with a similar contact geometry dif-\nfering only in electrode spacing. Consequently, the differ-\nences observed in the photocurrent persistence can be as-\ncribed to the different methods of contact fabrication.\nThe x-ray photocurrents measured from the graphitized\ndevice show minimal sensitivity to white light, as indicated\nin Fig. 5. At an x-ray dose rate of 2 mGy\/s, a photocurrent\nof 18.3 nA was observed, which was unaffected in terms of\nboth amplitude and time response by illumination with white\nlight. This is in marked contrast to Device 1, where white-\nlight illumination produced an \u000550% increase in x-ray pho-\ntocurrent \u0001Fig. 2\u0002.\nThe x-ray photocurrent persistence that we observe in\nDevice 1 is similar to that reported in natural type II-a\ndiamond1 in which decay time constants of \u0005100 s were\nobserved at room temperature due to detrapping from one or\nmore traps that are active at room temperature. Previous au-\nthors have assigned such phenomena in undoped CVD dia-\nmond to the band of shallow hole traps centered at an energy\napproximately 0.61 eV from the valance band.2,3 In contrast,\nphotocurrent measurements from coplanar detectors using\nFIG. 4.

Lett. 87, 093502 \u00022005\u0001fast pulsed UV lasers show a rapid time decay, consistent\nwith carrier recombination lifetimes of 200\u2013400 ps.4 When\nilluminated with long pulses of UV light, coplanar diamond\ndetectors also demonstrate significant photocurrent\npersistence.5 In one study using 200 nm irradiation from a\ndeuterium lamp, a clear dependence was observed between\nphotocurrent decay times and the nature of the metal-\ndiamond contact structure.6 This indicated that the photocur-\nrent decay time constant was strongly affected by the exact\nnature of the metal carbide\/diamond contact system, in addi-\ntion to the distribution of deep levels in the diamond bulk.\nThe role of surface states in the generation of sub band-gap\nphotocurrents has also been widely demonstrated in CVD\ndiamond. Extrinsic photoconductivity has been suppressed\nby various treatments of the exposed diamond surface, for\nexample, using methane7 or an oxygen plasma8 which re-\nmove sp2 bonded carbon phases from the diamond surface.\nThese data demonstrate the viability of a metal-less\nohmic contact on CVD diamond, based only on an ion-\nimplanted graphitic layer. The ion implantation and anneal-\ning scheme used in this work used a dose of 2\u00011016 cm\u22122 of\n70 keV boron ions, implanted at room temperature, followed\nby a 700 \u00b0C anneal for 4 min. Graphitization of the diamond\nsurface requires a critical implantation dose, which is depen-\ndent on both the ion type, energy, and implantation tempera-\nture. For room-temperature implantation of boron ions, this\ncritical dose is typically 1\u00011016 cm\u22122, below which the dia-\nmond can be restored to its original high resistivity state by\nannealing. At implantation temperatures below 320 K, the\nmechanism for graphitization is, first, the amorphization of\nthe diamond lattice, followed by the transition from sp3 to\nsp2 bonded carbon.\nVenkatesan et al.9 demonstrated ion-implanted ohmic\ncontacts fabricated on CVD diamond using a dose of 3.5\n\u00011016 cm\u22122. These structures contained a 0.2 \u0002m thick\ngraphitized surface layer which was removed by etching and\na Ti\/Au evaporated layer added to produce a low resistance\nohmic contact \u0001with a specific contact resistance of 1\n\u22124 \u22122\u000110 \u0003 cm \u0002.

The annealing scheme was based on that re-\nported by Zhang et al.;10 a 4 min anneal at 700 \u00b0C was cho-\nsen to ensure diffusion of boron ions from the interstitial\ndiamond lattice sites and hence a low contact resistance. By\ncontrast, annealing at too high a temperature, or for too long\nduration, can cause excess diffusion of boron to the surface.\nOur results demonstrate that interdigitated detector struc-\ntures can be successfully fabricated using a metal-less\ngraphitized ohmic contact which combines ease of fabrica-\ntion with improved performance due to the well-controlled\ndoped interface between the graphitic surface and the dia-\nmond bulk. The use of a single-step photolithographic ion\nimplantation, and the absence of metal lift off, considerably\nsimplifies the fabrication of interdigitated diamond detectors.\nThe graphitized devices did not show any photocurrent per-\nsistence when irradiated with x rays, which was in contrast to\ncoplanar devices fabricated using metal-carbide contacts.\nFurthermore, the graphitized devices show almost no sensi-\ntivity to white light, consistent with a low concentration of\nshallow defects in the near-contact region.\n1D.
