These pulsations occurred continuously for many hours and were observed throughout the magnetosphere and in the dusk-sector ionosphere. The subject of this paper is the favorable radial alignment of the Cluster, Polar, and geosynchronous satellites in the dusk sector during a 3-hour subset of this interval that allows extensive analysis of the global nature of the pulsations and the tracing of their energy transfer from the solar wind to the ground. Virtually monochromatic large-amplitude pulsations were observed by the CANOPUS magnetometer chain at dusk for several hours, during which the Cluster spacecraft constellation traversed the dusk magnetopause. The solar wind conditions were very steady, the solar wind speed was fast, and time series analysis of the solar wind dynamic pressure shows no significant power concentrated in the Pc5 band. The pulsations are observed in both geosynchronous electron and magnetic field data over a wide range of local times while Cluster is in the vicinity of the magnetopause providing clear evidence of boundary oscillations with the same periodicity as the ground and geosynchronous pulsations. Furthermore, the Polar spacecraft crossed the equatorial dusk magnetosphere outside of geosynchronous orbit (L \u223c 6\u20139) and observed significant electric and magnetic perturbations around the same quasi-stable central frequency (1.4\u20131.6 mHz). The Poynting vector observed by the Polar spacecraft associated with these pulsations has strong field-aligned oscillations, as expected for standing Alfv\u00e9n waves, as well as a nonzero azimuthal component, indicating a downtail component to the energy propagation.

Introduction\n[2] Global ultra low frequency (ULF) oscillations in the\nEarth\u2019s magnetosphere are believed to play a significant role\nin the mass, energy, and momentum transport within the\nEarth\u2019s magnetosphere. For example, ULF waves accelerate\nauroral electrons [e.g., Lotko et al., 1998] and are thought to\nplay a role in mass transport [e.g., Allan et al., 1990] and the\nenergization and transport of radiation belt electrons [e.g.,\nElkington et al., 1999]. Standing mode ULF oscillations on\nmagnetospheric field lines were first postulated by Dungey\n[1955]. These ULF perturbations can be excited externally\n(i.e., by the solar wind) or internally (via resonance with\nenergetic particle sources [e.g. Southwood et al., 1969]).\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 110, A12211, doi:10.1029\/2005JA011007, 2005\n1Department of Physics, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta,\nCanada.\n2Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Calgary, Calgary,\nAlberta, Canada.\n3Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester,\nLeicester, UK.\n4Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico, USA.\n5Also at Department of Communication Systems, Lancaster University,\nLancaster, UK.\n6NOAA Space Environment Center, Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n7Centre d\u2019Etude Spatiale des Rayonnements, Tolouse, France.\n8Physics Department, Imperial College London, London, UK.\nCopyright 2005 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/05\/2005JA011007$09.00\nA12211 1 of 16\nExternal solar wind drivers of ULF waves in the magne-\ntosphere include the Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability (KHI)\nvia surface waves [e.g., Southwood, 1974; Chen and\nHasegawa, 1974], direct solar wind ram pressure changes\n[e.g., Kepko et al., 2002], solar wind discontinuities [Allan\net al., 1986; Wright, 1994], solar wind buffeting [Wright\nand Rickard, 1995], sudden impulses [Mathie and Mann,\n2000], or wave overreflection [Mann et al., 1999].\n[3] ULF cavity modes [e.g., Kivelson et al., 1984;\nKivelson and Southwood, 1985] were first postulated to\nsupport the observations of nearly monochromatic ULF\nwave activity over a range of L shells. In this scenario the\nmagnetosphere could act as a resonant cavity when solar\nwind impulse events or density perturbations impact on the\nnear-Earth environment. Further studies [e.g., Walker et al.,\n1992; Samson et al., 1992a, 1992b] developed the wave-\nguide model, whereby the magnetosphere is open downtail\nand allows fast mode wave energy to propagate antisunward\ndown the magnetospheric waveguide. In the open wave-\nguide model, narrow-band compressional waves excited by\na broadband source in the solar wind are confined between\nthe magnetopause and an internal turning point in the\nmagnetosphere. The resonant frequencies that are produced\nby these bounded standing waves are discrete and, if both\nboundaries are highly reflective, long-lasting. Mann et al.\n[1999] extended this theory and presented a model for the\nexcitation of magnetospheric waveguide modes during fast\nsolar wind speed intervals by overreflection at the magne-\ntopause. The compressional cavity waveguide modes may\nexcite field line resonances (FLRs) where the frequency of\nthe compressional waves matches the local standing mode\nFLRs field line eigenfrequency.\n[4] There has been extensive evidence presented in the\nliterature that KHIs at the magnetopause can drive broad-\nband ULF wave energy into the magnetosphere. Miura\n[1987] presented simulations of magnetopause KHI-driven\nULF wave activity in the magnetosphere in the 3\u201310 mHz\nrange. Further work by Anderson et al. [1990] and Lessard\net al. [1999a] showed observationally that the same broad\nfrequency range of ULF wave power may be observed in\nthe magnetosphere, the frequency of which was highly\ndependent on L shell. However, there are few examples of\nnarrow-band oscillations driving discrete frequency FLRs.\nLessard et al. [1999b] presented both ground- and space-\nbased observations of a discrete frequency FLR most likely\ndriven by a solar wind impulse excited waveguide mode.\nFurthermore, Mann et al. [2002] presented observations\nfrom a high solar wind speed interval where the Cluster\nspacecraft constellation crossed the dusk-sector magneto-\nsphere and observed what were identified to be K-H driven\nmagnetopause oscillations, in conjunction with quasi-stable\nglobal magnetospheric oscillations seen in the ionosphere.\nTheir paper was the first observation-based study suggest-\ning a connection between a quasi-stable central frequency of\nmagnetopause oscillations and narrow-band ionospheric\nULF cavity\/waveguide mode activity. In their paper, Mann\net al. [2002] presented comprehensive ground-based obser-\nvations of FLR characteristics using magnetometer, high-\nfrequency (HF) radar, and optical data. The principal result\nwas the demonstration that KHI on the magnetopause likely\nproduced discrete frequency global ULF wave activity\nduring periods of high solar wind speed, perhaps by a\ndiscrete frequency magnetospheric waveguide mode which\nis energized by the overreflection mechanism discussed by\nMann et al. [1999].\n[5] The subject of how an external driving mechanism\ncan produce FLRs deep inside the magnetosphere is a topic\nof much debate. Walker [1981] considered the properties of\nK-H surface waves on the magnetopause and found that if\nthe wavelength on the magnetopause is of the order of ten\ntimes the thickness of the boundary, d (kyd \u0001 0.5\u20130.8), then\nthere is a preferred and finite wavelength which the growth\nrate is a maximum and Pc3\u2013Pc5 perturbations can be\nexcited. These modes hence have quite large azimuthal\nwave numbers, m or ky.\n[6] One alternative way to drive discrete frequency per-\nturbations with these frequencies but with smaller m is\ncavity\/waveguide theory [e.g., Mann et al., 1999; Mills et\nal., 1999]. Waveguide theory has two advantages over the\nsimple evanescent surface mode. First, the amplitude of the\nexcited ULF wave energy does not generally decay spatially\naway from the magnetopause; rather, the modes propagate\nradially into the magnetosphere. Second, waveguide theory\npredicts that the magnetosphere can act as a cavity which\ntraps discrete frequency compressional mode energy. In this\nscenario a structured spectrum of discrete harmonic fre-\nquencies should be observed which are determined by the\nsize of the magnetospheric cavity. For waveguide modes\nwhich are energized by shear flow at the magnetopause\n[e.g., Mann et al., 1999] the growth rate of the discrete\nfrequency modes can have maxima at finite and low-m\n[e.g., Mann et al., 1999, Figure 7]. In this way, discrete\nfrequency waveguide modes, energized by large magneto-\nsheath shear flows, can drive FLRs deep inside the\nmagnetosphere.\n[7] In this paper we consider global ULF pulsations in\na study similar to Mann et al. [2002]. The interval\npresented concerns a subsection of a period of fast solar\nwind speed (<850 kms\u00021) event from 24 to 26 November\n2001. A remarkable array of instrumentation was avail-\nable during this interval, and we concentrate on several\nhours on 25 November 2001 when the Cluster constella-\ntion was traversing the dusk sector magnetopause and\nwhen Polar was also in a favorable location. The energy\ndeposited into the magnetosphere via magnetopause\nboundary oscillations is followed through the magneto-\nsphere into an FLR and down into the Earth\u2019s ionosphere.\nThe satellite observations in situ are supplemented by\nground-based mesoscale measurements of the magnetic\nfluctuations as well as the ionospheric flows monitored\nby high-frequency (HF) radars.\n2. Instrumentation\n[8] Figure 1 shows the positions of the relevant spacecraft\nused in this study in the GSE X-Z plane (Figure 1a) and\nX-Y plane (Figure 1b) at 0200 UT on 25 November 2001\ntogether with the ground position of the Gillam (GILL)\nstation in the Churchill magnetometer line, part of the\nCANOPUS magnetometer array [Rostoker et al., 1995]\n(now operating as the CARISMA (Canadian Array for\nRealtime Investigations of Magnetic Activity) array; details\ncan be found at http:\/\/www.carisma.ca) around 1930 MLT.\nThe ACE (Advanced Composition Explorer) [Chiu et al.,\nA12211 RAE ET AL.: GLOBAL Pc5 ULF WAVE EVOLUTION\n2 of 16\nA12211\n1998] spacecraft was situated at [X GSE, Y GSE, Z GSE] \u0003\n[230, 40, 10] RE at 0200 UT and for clarity is not included\nin Figure 1; similarly, the Wind spacecraft [Acuna et al.,\n1995] was situated at [X GSE, Y GSE, Z GSE] \u0003 [20, \u000277, 7]\nRE and is not included in Figure 1b for clarity. There were\nthree available solar wind monitors in differing positions in\nthe solar wind (ACE, Wind, and Geotail) and a number of\nspacecraft were situated in the duskside magnetosphere.\nThe Cluster spacecraft were outbound across the dusk\nmagnetopause, Polar was traversing the duskside magneto-\nsphere situated close to the equator, and the geosynchro-\nnous GOES-8, -9, -10, and -12 spacecraft were also all on\nthe dusk flank. GOES-9 and -12 are not shown in Figure 1\nfor clarity but are around geosynchronous orbit and be-\ntween GOES-8 and -10. Similarly, for clarity the LANL\nspacecraft are not shown in Figure 1.

The satellite trajectories\nwere mapped into the ionosphere using the Tsyganenko 89c\n[Tsyganenko, 1989] magnetic field model (with Kp = 2).\n[9] In this paper we monitor the solar wind conditions\nusing data from the magnetometer (MAG) [Smith et al.,\n1998] and the solar wind proton alpha monitor (SWEPAM)\n[McComas et al., 1998] on the ACE spacecraft and the\nMagnetic Fields Instrument (MFI) [Lepping et al., 1995]\nand Solar Wind Experiment (SWE) [Ogilvie et al., 1995] on\nthe Wind spacecraft. In situ data for the magnetosphere is\nobtained from the Magnetic Fields Experiment (MFE)\n[Russell et al., 1995] and Electric Fields Instrument (EFI)\n[Harvey et al., 1995] on Polar; the Los Alamos National\nLaboratory (LANL) Synchronous Orbit Particle Analyzer\n(SOPA) [Belian et al., 1992]; the GOES [Singer et al.,\n1996] and Cluster Fluxgate (FGM) [Balogh et al., 1997]\nMagnetometers; and Cluster Ion Spectrometer instruments\n[Re`me et al., 2001] (the ion data from the Hot Ion Analyzer\n(HIA)). To complement the extensive space-based instru-\nmention, we use ground-based data from the CANOPUS\n[Rostoker et al., 1995] and SAMNET [Yeoman et al., 1990]\nmagnetometer networks and the SuperDARN HF radar\nsystem [Greenwald et al., 1995].\n3. Observations on 25 November 2001\n3.1. Interplanetary Conditions\n[10] Data from the ACE (black) and Wind (grey) space-\ncraft are shown in Figure 3 for the 25 November 2001,\n0100\u20130400 UT. The data have not been lagged; the IMF\nphase fronts appear to be highly tilted (i.e., negligible IMF\nBy compared to large and positive Bx and Bz) and hence\nimpinge on each spacecraft almost concurrently. A time\ndelay of 34 min is calculated between the spacecraft and the\nmagnetopause via the method of Khan and Cowley [1999],\nthough this lag is not added to the figure. Geotail was\nsituated close to the Earth and observed similar solar wind\nfeatures; Geotail data is not added to the figure for clarity.\nDuring the interval the IMF Bx component was large and\npositive and initially had a maximum amplitude of \u000114 nT\ndecreasing until \u00010400 UT when Bx approached zero. The\nIMF By component fluctuated between \u00023 < By < +6 nT\nduring the interval, and the IMF Bz component was large\nand positive and varied between \u000110 and 16 nT. The solar\nwind velocity remained approximately constant between\n750 and 800 km s\u00021 until \u00010245 UT, when it dropped to\n650\u2013700 km s\u00021. The dynamic pressure, Psw, fluctuated but\nremained around \u00011.5\u20132 nPa. An FFT analysis of the time-\nshifted ACE, Wind, and Geotail (not shown) dynamic\npressure data between 0100 and 0400 UT revealed no\nsignificant peaks that might be responsible for directly\nFigure 1.

[2002].\n3.2. Dusk-Sector Magnetopause Measurements\n[11] The Cluster spacecraft were outbound through the\nmagnetopause in the dusk sector in the early UT hours on\n25 November 2001. The FGM instruments on all four\nspacecraft switched on at around \u00010100 UT. From top to\nbottom, Figure 4a shows data from 0200 to 0300 UT of the\nCIS HIA ion spectra and derived ion velocity magnitudes\nfrom Cluster 1, together with total magnetic field (Btotal)\nfrom all four spacecraft. Figure 4b shows normalized power\nspectral analysis of (top) Btotal from Cluster 1\u20134 and\n(bottom) CIS ion velocities from Cluster-3 and -4 from\n0200\u20130300 UT with the grey shaded box indicating the\n1.4\u20131.6 mHz frequency band.\n[12] The total magnetic field observed by all four Cluster\nspacecraft shows significant oscillatory motion of the total\nmagnetic field of \u000120 nT in magnitude, superposed on a\nslowly varying background field. For the first half of the\ninterval (\u00010200\u20130230 UT), the magnetic field strength\nvaried from \u000120 nT to \u000140 nT. There is an extremely clear\ncorrelation between the magnetic field intensity and the\nCIS\/HIA ion speeds, spectra, and densities (the latter not\nshown). When the magnetic field strength was higher, the\nflow speeds were larger (up to 600 km s\u00021) and the ion\nspectra showed higher fluxes, typical of a magnetosheath\npopulation (\u0001a few keV). These passes correspond to\nmagnetopause crossings into the magnetosheath. The lower\nion speeds correspond to inner magnetopause boundary\nlayer and plasma sheet encounters. The latter is character-\nized by a broader ion spectra with the presence of higher-\nFigure 2.

These observations show that\nthe magnetopause boundary was being perturbed and the\nboundary was moving quasi-periodically across the slowly\nmoving spacecraft. Using FFT analysis in the interval\n0200\u20130300 UT, the frequency of the perturbations is shown\nin Figure 4b. There is significant power in the 1.4\u20131.6 mHz\nband, both in the magnetic field measurements and ion\nvelocities. The significance of this frequency band will be\ndiscussed in section 4.\n[13] The FGM and CIS observations clearly suggest that\nCluster is being periodically plunged across the magneto-\npause and boundary layer and into the magnetosheath\ncharacterized by faster flows and different magnetic field\nstrength. The most likely explanation is the periodic distor-\ntion of the magnetopause by a ULF wave with a frequency\nof \u00011.6 mHz; long-wavelength and large-amplitude pertur-\nbations being suggested by the observed temporal coher-\nence between the magnetic field observed by all Cluster\nspacecraft. In the 0200\u20130230 UT interval, periodic Pc5\ninward and outward motion with a frequency of \u00011.6 mHz\nis particularly clear. During the inferred outward magneto-\npause motion (i.e., when Cluster is plunged deeper into the\nmagnetosphere), Cluster-3 tends to see Btotal magnetic field\nchanges first, followed by Cluster-2, and then Cluster-1 and\nCluster-4 (the most clear examples being 0200\u20130203 UT,\n0211\u20130214 UT, and 0229\u20130232 UT). During inward\nmagnetopause motion (i.e., when Cluster moves closer to\nthe magnetosheath), the opposite order of satellite crossings\nis generally apparent (the most clear examples being 0203\u2013\n0207 UT, 0124\u20130216 UT, and 0217\u20130219 UT). The\norientation of the magnetopause excursions can be analyzed\nusing the available multisatellite Cluster data; however, this\nwill be pursued in a later paper.\n3.3. Polar Spacecraft Observations\n[14] Figure 5 shows the Polar MFE (6 s resolution) and\nEFI (20 Hz resolution averaged with a boxcar window to 6 s\ncadence) data for the 0100\u20130400 UT interval in field-\naligned coordinates. The location of Polar during this\ninterval is shown in Figure 6 (bottom). To calculate the\ndirection of the measured fields in a coordinate system\naligned with the ambient magnetic field, the data was\ntransformed from [XGSM, YGSM, ZGSM] to [XFA, YFA,\nZFA], where ZFA is field-aligned, XFA lies in a plane defined\nby ZFA and the geocentric radius vector to the spacecraft and\nis perpendicular to ZFA, and YFA completes this right-\nhanded orthogonal set. This orthogonal coordinate system\nwas derived using a running mean of the ambient magnetic\nfield of 20 min duration. From top to bottom, Figure 5\nshows the oscillations in magnetic dBx (Figure 5a), dBy\n(Figure 5b), and dBz (Figure 5c), electric dEx (Figure 5d),\ndEy (Figure 5e), and dEz (Figure 5f) fields (the data have\nbeen band-pass filtered between 1 and 10 mHz), and the\ncalculated components of the wave Poynting vector, Sx\n(Figure 5g), Sy (Figure 5h), and Sz (Figure 5i) of these\nfluctuating fields. Immediately obvious is the oscillatory\nnature of the wave magnetic and electric fields in Figure 5.\nWe concentrate mainly on the monochromatic \u00011.6 mHz\nsignal seen in the \u0001azimuthal (dBy) and \u0001radial (dEx)\ncomponents between \u00010150\u20130315 UT. The oscillations in\ndBz, dEy, and dEz do not show this monochromatic wave as\nclearly. Furthermore, the magnitudes of the calculated dEy\nand dEz are significantly smaller than those in the dEx\ndirection. The perpendicular components of the electric\n(dEx) and magnetic (dBy) fields are also clearly 90\u0001 out of\nphase, which is expected for a standing Alfve\u00b4n wave.\n[15] The total wave magnetic field variation is small\n(<5%) relative to the ambient magnetic field strength\n(\u000140\u201345 nT), as is the azimuthal (dBy) component of the\nwave magnetic field with respect to the ambient magnetic\nfield (ranging from 0.5 to 8%) during the interval. This\nindicates that the transverse component of this Alfve\u00b4n wave\nis a factor of \u00012 larger than its compressional component,\nalthough the perturbations in dBz (field-aligned direction)\nindicate that there must also be compressional wave activity.\nThe YFA component of the Poynting vector is predomi-\nnantly positive in the \u0001azimuthal direction between 0120\u2013\n0245 UT, i.e., down tail, which is consistent with magne-\ntopause fluctuations caused via an external solar wind\ndriver. Between 0150 and 0330 UT, the field-aligned\nFigure 3. Solar wind conditions for 25 November 2001\n0100\u20130400 UT from ACE (black line) and Wind (grey\nline). From top to bottom, the following parameters are\nplotted: IMF Bx, By, Bz, solar wind velocity (Vsw), and\ndynamic pressure (Psw). The IMF phase fronts are orientated\nsuch that despite the distance between the spacecraft, no\ntime delays are included in Figure 3, though a time delay of\n34 min has been added to lag the data to the magnetopause\n(via the method of Khan and Cowley [1999]).\nA12211 RAE ET AL.: GLOBAL Pc5 ULF WAVE EVOLUTION\n5 of 16\nA12211\ncomponent of the wave Poynting vector is clearly associated\nwith the monochromatic oscillations in dBy and dEx. The net\nfield-aligned component of the Poynting vector clearly\noscillates almost symmetrically with a frequency around\ntwice the 1.6 mHz frequency of the Alfve\u00b4n wave. The net\ndirection on average is slightly in the positive field-aligned\ndirection, i.e., directed away from the equator and toward the\nnorthern hemispheric ionosphere. This is as expected for a\nstanding Alfve\u00b4n wave damped by ionospheric dissipation.\n[16] For a mixed (partially toroidal and partially poloidal)\npolarization field line resonance observed over a range of L\nshells, one would expect circular polarization of one sense\n(equal to either positive or negative unity) earthward (or\nequatorward) of the FLR, linear polarization at maximum\namplitude at the resonant field line, and circular polarization\nin the opposite sense for antiearthward (or poleward) of the\nFLR, depending on the local field line location on the\nground with respect to local noon [Samson et al., 1971].\nComplex demodulation [e.g., Beamish et al., 1979] allows\nthe determination of the amplitude and phase characteristics\nof a nonstationary time series through comparison to a\nreference signal. Figure 6 shows the polarization character-\nistics of the transverse component of the wave magnetic\nfield, i.e., dBx versus dBy, for the same interval. Figure 6\nshows the high-pass filtered (at 1000 s) (Figure 6a) Bx,\nand (Figure 6b) By signals, (Figure 6c) the amplitude and\n(Figure 6d) phase of the 1.6 mHz component, along with\n(Figure 6e) the ellipticity, and (Figure 6f) the polarization\nangle of the wave for the 1.6 mHz demodulate. The\nellipticity of the wave is the ratio of the minor axis to the\nFigure 4.

A circularly polarized wave has an ellipticity of unity,\nthe sign indicating clockwise (+1) or anticlockwise (\u00021)\npolarization. The polarization angle is the azimuth of the\nellipse measured positive clockwise from X. If the two axes\nare the same length, the wave is circularly polarized and the\nellipticity is unity. If the ellipticity is +(\u0002) 1, then Bx (By)\nleads By (Bx) and the wave is clockwise (anticlockwise)\npolarized. If the components are approximately equal, \u000245\u0001\nindicates that dBx and dBy are in antiphase, and if the\ncomponents are in phase, the polarization angle will be\n+45\u0001.\n[17] The amplitudes of both the Bx and By components of\nthe field perturbations have significant power and peaks in\namplitude in the range 0200\u20130300 UT, together with a\nconstant phase (the By component is phase-wrapped). The\npolarization characteristics of the field perturbations that\nPolar measures throughout the interval 0100\u20130400 UT\nevolve throughout the interval. At the start of the interval\nFigure 5. Polar electric and magnetic field data trans-\nformed into field-aligned coordinates [XFA, YFA, ZFA] (see\ntext for details).

Around 0215 UT the\npolarization and ellipticity has changed to \u0001\u000245 and\n\u0001zero, respectively. This implies that the wave is linearly\npolarized and that Bx and By are in antiphase. After\n0215 UT the polarization angle and ellipticity are both\nalways negative, which implies that By always leads Bx\nand that the wave is no longer linearly polarized. During\nthe 3-hour interval, Polar moves only a small distance of\none L shell (\u00018.6\u20139.6 RE), so the full latitudinal phase\nreversal [e.g., Samson et al., 1971] is not observed in the\nPolar data along its satellite track during these times. The\nantiphase relationship between the poloidal and toroidal\ncomponent suggests that Polar is monitoring the wave at\nL shells very close to the resonant (maximum amplitude)\nfield line. Of course, there is also a compressional com-\nponent to these perturbations, which might also partially\nmask the expected phase reversal typical of field line\nresonance. We discuss this further below.\n3.4. Geosynchronous Particle and Field Observations\n[18] Figures 7a\u20137d shows the geosynchronous GOES -8,\n-9, -10, and -12 magnetic field data in local spacecraft\ncoordinates such that e is directed radially inward, n is\nazimuthally eastward (down-tail at dusk), p is parallel to the\nEarth\u2019s spin axis, and t is the total magnetic field [Singer et\nal., 1996]. There are significant magnetic perturbations seen\nin all GOES spacecraft in all magnetic field components at\n\u00011.5 mHz frequency. The GOES-10 spacecraft observes\nsignificantly lower (by \u000140 nT) radial Be and significantly\nstronger (by \u000115 nT) Bp and BT background magnetic field\nstrength as compared to GOES-8, -9, and \u201312 and a larger\nazimuthal magnetic field strength. This is likely to be due to\nthe fact that GOES-10 is closest to noon, while GOES-8, -9,\nand -12 are toward the nightside of the Earth and are in a\nmore stretched magnetic field regime, thus with lower\nparallel and stronger earthward magnetic fields. The differ-\nent magnetic latitudes of the spacecraft also contribute to the\nobserved differences in the background fields. Indeed, these\nvariations between GOES 10 and GOES -8, -9, and -12\nhave been confirmed by seeing similar variations in the\nOlson-Pfitzer 1977 quiet-time magnetic field model com-\nponents at the GOES 8 and 10 locations. With regard to the\nwaves, similar wave-packet structure (e.g., around 0140\u2013\n0220 UT at GOES-10) appears in all the GOES satellites in\nthe azimuthal Bn component. The azimuthal magnetic field\noscillations are first observed by GOES-10, then -9, -12,\nand finally GOES-8. Relating this to the spacecraft locations\nindicates the down-tail propagation of the magnetic distur-\nbances that excite this toroidal mode wave-packet. Figure 7d\nshows the total magnetic field from each of the four\nspacecraft. The compressional component of the wave can\nstill be seen to some extent with the largest amplitudes in\nGOES-10, though the total magnetic fields do not change\nsignificantly (dB\/B < 10%). The compressional wave com-\nponent is most obvious in GOES-10, closest to noon,\nwhereas the transverse component of the wave magnetic\nfield is most obvious in GOES-8, -9, and -12, which are\ncloser to midnight. Interestingly, the phase lag observed\nbetween satellites in the compressional component BT\n(expected to be also classified by Bp and Be at this local\ntime) in this wave-packet appears to be much less than\nseen in Bn, although the same general phase lag trend (i.e.,\nGOES-10, -9, -12, and -8) is apparent especially in Bp.\nComparing the phase variation of the azimuthal Bn com-\nponent between spacecraft pairs gives azimuthal wave\nnumbers of m \u0001 1.3\u20136.5, propagating downtail, which\nis consistent with these perturbations being global-scale\nphenomena.\n[19] Figures 7e\u20137h shows LANL spacecraft observations\nof electron fluxes in three energy channels, taken to be\nrepresentative of the entire range of energy channels from\nthe SOPA instrument. At 0200 UT, LANL-095 (at 2330\nLT), LANL-080 (at 1500 LT), LANL-084 (at 0900 LT), and\nLANL-97a (at 0700 LT) provided information on the dawn,\nafternoon, and midnight sector geosynchronous particle\npopulations. Interestingly, Figures 7e\u20137h show that the\ngeosynchronous electron fluxes are also being modulated\nat 1.4\u20131.6 mHz at all four LANL satellites. Significantly,\nthe signatures in the electron fluxes at geosynchronous orbit\nare modulated much more strongly than the ions (not\nshown).\n3.5. Ground-Based and Ionospheric Measurements\n[20] The dusk sector of the magnetosphere is well pop-\nulated with ground-based instrumentation in this interval,\nand we use this instrumentation to characterize a well-\ndefined field line resonance (FLR). In Table 1 we list the\nlocations of the relevant CANOPUS magnetometer stations.\nFigure 8a shows the unfiltered H-component magnetic field\nmeasurements from the CANOPUS \u2018\u2018Churchill line\u2019\u2019 from\n0100 to 0400 UT on 25 November 2001. Data from the two\nhighest-latitude Churchill line stations (TALO and RANK)\nwere not available during this period. There is obvious\nlarge-amplitude and very narrow-band Pc5 ULF wave\nactivity throughout the period, the clearest waves occurring\nbetween 0200 and 0300 UT, and the largest amplitudes\noccurring at the Gillam station.\n[21] The H- (diamonds) and D- (stars) components were\nalso high-pass filtered (at 1000 s) to remove any long-term\ntrends, then a complex demodulation amplitude analysis\nperformed (see section 3.3). Figure 8b shows the complex\ndemodulation of the dominant spectral peak (i.e., 1.5 mHz),\ntaken at 0235 UT. The wave characteristics at Polar reveal\nthat the wave is a dominantly toroidal shear Alfve\u00b4n wave at\nthis frequency, with a small compressional component. For\na dominantly Alfve\u00b4nic toroidal field line resonance, it has\nbeen shown that the perturbations in the magnetosphere\nare rotated through 90\u0001 upon transmission through a\nuniformly conducting ionosphere to the ground [Hughes\nand Southwood, 1976]. Therefore a toroidally (azimuthally)\npolarized wave in the magnetosphere is expected to be\ndominated by the H-component when measured by a\nground-based magnetometer. From Figure 8b we see that\nthe H-component displays the classic FLR characteristics of\nan amplitude peak across which there is a 180\u0001 phase\nchange [e.g., Walker et al., 1979; Samson et al., 1992a,\n1992b; Fenrich and Samson, 1997]. The D-component also\nhas a smaller-amplitude peak and a 180\u0001 phase change\nacross it. One point to note is that when the low-amplitude\nwaves at ESK and PIN are analyzed, the overall phase\nchange across the resonance is actually larger than 180\u0001.\nA12211 RAE ET AL.: GLOBAL Pc5 ULF WAVE EVOLUTION\n8 of 16\nA12211\n[22] Comparing the phase variation of the longitudinally\nseparated station pair of FSI-FCH gives a maximum\nazimuthal wave number of m \u0001 +4, i.e., propagating\ndown-tail, and consistent with these waves being global\nmagnetospheric phenomena in this event.\n[23] Further evidence of the global nature of these\nperturbations is shown by small-amplitude waves in\nthe H-component magnetic perturbations observed by the\nSAMNET and IMAGE magnetometer arrays in the\nEuropean sector (not shown). Referring to Figure 1, at\nFigure 7. Geosynchronous magnetic field and electron observations from the GOES and LANL\nspacecraft, respectively.

These measurements provide clear evidence\nfor small-amplitude 1.4\u20131.6 mHz activity on the ground\nalso being present in the predawn sector.\n[24] Figure 9 shows the SuperDARN HF radar mea-\nsurements from six of the northern hemisphere radars\nbetween 1800 UT on 24 November 2001 and 0400 UT on\n25 November 2001 in AACGM coordinates [Baker and\nWing, 1989]. The color scales are independently scaled for\neach radar panel to accentuate the wave observation, though\nin all panels, blue denotes line-of-sight Doppler velocities\ntoward the radar and red denotes line-of-sight velocities\naway from the radar. The dashed black and white line\ndenotes the approximate location of local dusk at each radar\nbore site. Local dusk is around 0430 UT at Kodiak. Data\nwere not available from the two radars at Hankasalmi and\nPykkvibaer. Only one beam is shown from each of the\nradars for brevity, but data from these beams are represen-\ntative of essentially the entire radar field of views. Data\nfrom each beam shown in Figure 9 shows clear oscillations\nof the ionospheric line-of-sight velocity. There is also some\npoleward phase propagation of this backscatter in several\nbeams, most notably in Prince George beam 6 (Figure 9b).\nHowever, most of the radar backscatter is too far poleward\nto see the FLR directly. The radars in the Alaskan sector\nobserved the ionospheric signatures at the lowest latitudes,\nwhich were possibly the signature of the FLR directly.\n[25] Pc5 oscillations with a frequency of 1.4 mHz are\nvery clear just predusk in the \u00010200\u20130300 UT period for\nthe Prince George radar, in the latitude range 66\u201375\u0001.\nEvidence for waves of similar frequency (\u00011.5 mHz) can\nalso be seen in the near range gates Kodiak in the same UT\ninterval which corresponds to 64\u201373\u0001 and at higher lati-\ntudes in the \u00010100\u20130200 UT interval (\u000173\u201375\u0001). Back-\nscatter is generally poor for the Saskatoon and Kapuskasing\nradars between 0100 and 0400 UT during our wave interval,\nalthough evidence of 1.5 mHz waves is apparent in the\nSaskatoon radar around 69\u201372\u0001 in the period before it\n\u00010000\u20130150 UT, and at a much higher frequency in\nKapuskasing around 66\u201370\u0001 between 2230 and 0100 UT\nin the \u00012.1 mHz range. These two radars are those\nconjugate to the Polar satellite and the CANOPUS Churchill\nline magnetometers. It must be stressed that the UT interval\nwhere the Kapuskasing radar has sufficient backscatter to\nobserve ULF wave activity is not the same period as the\nprincipal wave event studied in this paper. Further east, the\nGoose Bay radar observes Pc5 waves between \u000167 and 74\u0001\nin the \u00010130\u20130240 UT interval with a frequency of\n\u00011.3 mHz, which is similar to those seen at Polar and\nCANOPUS. Further east still, Iceland West saw wave\nactivity in this broad frequency range (\u00011.3 mHz) for\nFigure 8.

Measurements of\nconjugate radar flows from Saskatoon and Kapuskasing with\nsimilar frequencies as those seen by Polar and CANOPUS\nin the 0100\u20130400 UT interval are lacking, mostly due to\nloss of backscattered power. However, the adjacent Prince\nGeorge and Goose Bay radars provide evidence that the\nsame wave exists over an extended longitudinal range\naround dusk and in the 0100\u20130300 UT time interval.\n4. Discussion\n[27] The data presented in this paper provide very clear\nevidence for an observational link between wave activity at\nFigure 9. Line-of-sight (l-o-s) velocity measurements from beams of the network of the northern\nhemispheric SuperDARN radar network between 1600 UT on 24 November and 0400 UT on\n25 November.

We\ninterpret the magnetic field and ion variations seen at\nCluster to be due to the oscillatory motion of the magne-\ntopause boundary layer across the spacecraft. This magne-\ntopause boundary motion can lead to the excitation of ULF\nwaves inside the magnetosphere.\n[28] Wright and Rickard [1995] produced numerical sim-\nulations that indicated in some cases global pulsations due\nto magnetospheric waveguide modes can be excited via\nbuffeting at the magnetopause by the solar wind. In their\nstudies these authors developed simulations of two solar\nwind drivers: a \u2018\u2018stationary pulse,\u2019\u2019 characteristic of\nimpulses over the magnetopause nose, which produced\npulsations characteristic of the magnetosphere structure\n(independent of the pulse characteristics); and \u2018\u2018running\npulses,\u2019\u2019 expected to be characteristic of Kelvin-Helmholtz\nsurface waves as well as moving magnetopause indenta-\ntions, which produced magnetopause ripples and hence\nwaveguide modes and FLRs that had phase velocities equal\nto the speed of the running pulse.\n[29] Rostoker and Sulivan [1987] found that 75% of\nafternoon sector pulsations were associated with solar\nwind impulses. Mathie and Mann [2000] discussed the\noccurrence of observations of morning sector Pc5 FLRs\nwith respect to sudden impulse events occurring in the\nsolar wind, separating those associated with magneto-\npause instabilities and those perhaps associated with\nsudden impulse events. These authors showed that for\nhigher solar wind speeds, there was a clear correlation\nbetween the existence of common azimuthal phase speed\nmultiple discrete frequency FLRs and the presence of\nhigh magnetosheath flow speed (>500 km s\u00021), which is\nconsistent with Kelvin-Helmholtz magnetopause activity\ndriving these discrete frequency waveguide modes which\nthen drive FLRs [e.g., Mann et al., 1999]. Impulsive FLR\nexcitation on the other hand was shown to be able to\noccur under any conditions, though mainly for lower\nsolar wind speeds (<500 km s\u00021).\n[30] Kepko et al. [2002] presented an interval where\nthere were discrete frequencies in the upstream solar wind\nnumber density and dynamic pressure, which correlated\nwell with time-shifted observed magnetic field magnitude\nvariations observed in the magnetosphere by the GOES\nspacecraft. These authors suggest that features inherent in\nthe solar wind at discrete frequencies may be responsible\nfor discrete frequency global ULF pulsations in the\nmagnetosphere.\n[31] The data collected at Polar, located in the dusk\nsector central plasma sheet around L \u0001 9, shows an\nAlfve\u00b4n wave signature of \u00014 nT peak-to-peak magnetic\nand \u00012 mVm\u00021 peak-to-peak electric field amplitude\nwhich persists for \u00012.5 hours in the data set. Our\nanalysis has shown that this wave is predominantly a\nstanding transverse Alfve\u00b4n wave with a significant field-\naligned component of the Poynting vector. Given that the\nPolar observations are made near the equatorial plane, the\nproximity of Polar to the expected equatorial node may\nexplain the significantly smaller magnetic amplitude seen\nat Polar as compared to CANOPUS on the ground. This\ninterpretation is also supported by the \u00012 mV m\u00021 peak-\nto-peak electric field amplitude. The data from Polar also\nshows there is a small compressional magnetic compo-\nnent to this wave, which may represent the driving fast\ncompressional waveguide mode. The fact that there is still\ncompressional wave activity present around this region is\nfurther verified by the magnetic field measurements by\nthe GOES spacecraft. The azimuthal component of the\nPoynting vector of the wave as determined by the Polar\ndata has a large contribution from the compressional\ncomponent and is directed antisunward, which is consis-\ntent with compressional waveguide modes driven by\nmagnetopause fluctuations which propagate antisunward\ndowntail in the Earth\u2019s magnetospheric waveguide. The\nsmall amplitude of the compressional magnetic field\ncomponent (expected to have an antinode in the equato-\nrial plane) may result from the fact that the driving\ncompressional waveguide mode energy density is spread\nglobally throughout the outer magnetospheric waveguide.\nAlternately, the driving fast mode source could be an\nevanescent magnetopause surface mode [e.g., Southwood,\n1974] rather than by Kelvin-Helmholtz excited overre-\nflected body-type waveguide modes [e.g., Mann et al.,\n1999].\n[32] We postulate that the wave energy is most probably\ngenerated by a Kelvin-Helmholtz type instability on the\nmagnetopause driving compressional waves traveling in-\nward through the magnetosphere. Some of this energy is\nthen transferred to standing Alfve\u00b4n waves along field lines\nin a region that brackets the GOES and Polar L shells (L \u0001\n6\u20139). Both SuperDARN radar data and ground-based\nmagnetometer networks observe these standing waves. All\nof the waves observed have a clearly defined quasi-stable\ncentral frequency in the range 1.4\u20131.6 mHz, based on\nwhich we argue that these waves are clearly are part of a\nwell-defined path of energy transfer from the solar wind\ndriven magnetopause oscillations to the inner magneto-\nsphere and ionosphere.\n[33] The discrete frequency signatures seen by the\nground-based CANOPUS array and by Polar in situ in the\nmagnetosphere are also observed magnetically by the four\nGOES spacecraft situated approximately between local\nnoon and local dusk, as well as via energetic electron\nsignatures on four LANL satellites distributed from approx-\nimately midnight to the postnoon sector. The LANL elec-\ntron data show clearer oscillations in the 225\u2013315 keV\nenergy channel for the SOPA throughout these local times,\nalthough it is also seen in the lower-energy 150\u2013225 keV\nand 75\u2013105 keV channels, especially at LANL-095 and\n-080. Although the phase relationships between the fluxes\nin different energy channels at different LANL spacecraft\nseem to be complex, it seems clear that the energetic\nelectrons are coupled to the discrete frequency ULF wave.\nThe global nature of the electron flux variations suggests\nthat local interactions between the monochromatic duskside\nFLR electric field and the energetic electrons produced\neffects along the drift-path which is observed at other local\ntimes by the LANL satellite constellation at each satellite\nlocation.\n[34] Mann et al. [2002] showed that during one fast solar\nwind speed event the dusk sector magnetopause oscillated\nA12211 RAE ET AL.: GLOBAL Pc5 ULF WAVE EVOLUTION\n12 of 16\nA12211\nwith a frequency of 2\u20132.5 mHz, which in turn drove\ndiscrete frequency FLRs believed to have been driven by\nKelvin-Helmholtz unstable magnetospheric waveguide\nmodes. However, during this interval, there were no space-\ncraft in and around the mode-conversion region. In contrast,\nin this study the Polar spacecraft provides key information\nabout the mode-conversion region and yields stronger\ninsights into the energy transfer process during the interval\npresented here.\n[35] An important aspect of our data analysis for this\nevent is the calculation of the wave Poynting vector from\nthe Polar electric and magnetic fields. We find that there is a\nvery small radial, significant azimuthal, and dominant field-\naligned component to the wave Poynting vector. In a similar\nstudy, Clemmons et al. [2000] presented Polar observations\nof several wave cycles of electric and magnetic Pc5 activity\nduring a magnetic cloud driven event in the magnetosphere.\nThese authors also determined that the ULF waves had\nsignificant field-aligned component of the Poynting vector\nand concluded that this was due to two counterpropagating\n(toroidal and poloidal polarization) shear Alfve\u00b4n waves\nwhich had pulsation signatures characteristic of FLRs on\nthe ground. In contrast, for the study presented here we offer\nthe simple interpretation that the large oscillatory Poynting\nvectors we observed were standing mode shear Alfve\u00b4n\nwaves set up along the resonant field line situated close to\nthe orbital location of Polar.\n[36] The interval presented in this paper is remarkable for\na number of reasons. For energy and momentum to be\ntraced from solar wind, into the terrestrial environment, and\ndown into the ionosphere and the ground demands a\nfavorable conjunction of satellite and ground instrumenta-\ntion. Several studies have carried out analysis of some of the\nsteps in this pathway of energy transfer, but ours is the first\nsuch interval to have spacecraft in all relevant areas and\nground-based coverage to track energy transfer from the\nmagnetopause down to the Earth\u2019s surface.\n[37] Perhaps more importantly, our observations provide\nevidence that discrete frequency waveguide modes and\nFLRs can be excited by K-H shear flow instability at the\nmagnetopause [Mann et al., 1999; Mills et al., 1999]. As\ndiscussed by Mann et al. [1999], for magnetosheath flow\nspeeds greater than a critical value (500 km s\u00021) Kelvin-\nHelmholtz instabilities at the magnetopause can couple to\nbody-type waveguide modes. In this case these discrete\nfrequency waveguide modes can be excited by K-H\nshear-flow instability at the magnetopause. It should be\nnoted that the classic KH surface wave instability, excited\nat a boundary between two semi-infinite media, has an\nupper cutoff flow speed beyond which the KH surface\nmode is no longer unstable. In the case where the one of\nmedia is bounded (in this case the magnetosphere) low-m\nbody-type waveguide modes do not possess a maximum\nflow speed for instability; rather, in order to excite the\nbody-type modes, the flow speed must be greater than a\ncritical speed in order for shear flow K-H instability to\ngenerate growing modes (see Mann et al. [1999] and\nMills et al. [1999] for more details). We believe that the\ndiscrete frequency Pc5 FLR reported here was excited by\nthis mechanism.\n[38] Finally, we present a spectral analysis of the time-\nshifted (by 24 min) solar wind dynamic pressure, together\nwith data from each spacecraft and instrument from this\ninterval. The parameters shown here are taken as represen-\ntative, as there is simply too much information presented in\nthis paper to show all parameters at each location. Figure 10\nshows a composite plot of solar wind dynamic pressure\n(Figure 10a), Cluster magnetic fields and plasma measure-\nments close to the magnetopause (Figure 10b), transverse\nmagnetospheric magnetic and electric fields from Polar\n(Figure 10c), azimuthal magnetospheric fields (Figure 10d),\ngeosynchronous electron fluxes (Figure 10e), ionospheric\nline-of-sight velocities (Figure 10f), and ground magnetic\nperturbations (Figure 10g). The grey area denotes the 1.4\u2013\n1.6 mHz band. From Figure 10 we can see that no spectral\npeak is apparent in the appropriately lagged solar wind\ndynamic pressure in this frequency band, whereas there\nare dominant spectral peaks in Figures 10b\u201310g in the\nmagnetospheric and ionospheric magnetic fields and veloc-\nities, magnetospheric electric fields, and particle fluxes.\nFrom this we conclude that the magnetospheric and iono-\nspheric oscillations are not related to the action of direct\ndriving by solar wind dynamic pressure variations, such as\nthose outlined by Kepko et al. [2002].\n5. Conclusions\n[39] In summary, we present observations from 2 No-\nvember 2001, where, during a high solar wind speed\ninterval, the magnetopause was periodically crossed by\nCluster at \u00011.5 mHz periodicity. We surmise that mag-\nnetopause undulations observed by Cluster drove com-\npressional waves, perhaps in the form of K-H unstable\nmagnetospheric waveguide modes, that propagate inward\nfrom the magnetopause. These compressional waves cou-\nple to resonant field lines close to location of Polar and\ngeosynchronous orbit. Polar electric and magnetic fields\nvaried significantly in the plane perpendicular to the\nbackground magnetic field, producing a large and oscil-\nlatory field-aligned component of the Poynting vector\nconsistent with a standing Alfve\u00b4n wave field line reso-\nnance. A downtail component of the Poynting vector was\nalso observed at Polar, consistent with a solar wind\nsource. The ground oscillations, both at dusk and post-\nmidnight, are quasi-monochromatic (1.5\u20131.6 mHz). The\nmagnetic fields and electron fluxes at geosynchronous\norbit also oscillated at similar frequencies. The iono-\nspheric signature of this FLR was observed across a\nbroad range of local time by SuperDARN HF radars,\nparticularly around dusk, as well as by conjugate mag-\nnetometers in the CANOPUS array. Ground magneto-\nmeters observe FLR signatures around \u00011.5\u20131.6 mHz,\nand we calculate an approximate azimuthal wave number\nof m \u0001 +4. Calculations from the SuperDARN HF radars\nappear to be poleward of the region of the excited FLR\nand map to L shells close to the magnetopause. Therefore\nthese ionospheric flows may simply be indicative of the\nexcitation mechanism rather than the actual field line\nresonance. These are large-amplitude (\u0001800 m\/s in the\nionosphere, roughly 200 nT peak-to-peak with the mag-\nnetometer at Gillam), nearly monochromatic pulsations\nseen ubiquitously in the magnetosphere and ionosphere.\nWe believe that the properties of the waves are deter-\nmined by natural frequencies of the magnetospheric\nA12211 RAE ET AL.: GLOBAL Pc5 ULF WAVE EVOLUTION\n13 of 16\nA12211\nwaveguide, while the energy originates from boundary\noscillations at the magnetopause.\n[40] The excellent conjunction of ground- and space-\nbased instrumentation in the afternoon sector provides a\nmeans to trace energy from the solar wind into the Earth\u2019s\nmagnetosphere and ionosphere. Few studies have identi-\nfied a one-to-one correspondence between magnetopause\noscillations and ionospheric wave activity. In this event,\nthe Polar data provides a direct link between Cluster\nmeasurements of magnetopause oscillations and FLR\nsignatures detected in the ionosphere by SuperDARN\nand the CANOPUS magnetometer network. This is the\nfirst such study to have such advantageous instrumentation\ncollecting data over the same time interval.\n[41] Our observations are consistent with the hypothesis\nthat Kelvin-Helmholtz instability at the magnetopause ex-\ncited discrete frequency compressional waveguide modes in\nthe magnetosphere. These waveguide modes propagated\nFigure 10.
