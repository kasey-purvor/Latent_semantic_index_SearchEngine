This article considers one universal \ndeclaration, the UNESCO Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights (2005), to \nwhich a special issue of Developing World Bioethics was dedicated.  General \ncriticisms made there are that the concepts used in the Declaration are too general and \nvague to generate real commitment; that the so-called universal values are not \nuniversal; and, that UNESCO should not be engaged in producing such declarations \nwhich are the domain of professional bioethicists. This article considers these and \nother criticisms in detail and presents an example of an event in which the Declaration \nwas used: the request by the Republic of Sakha, in Siberia, for a UNESCO delegation \nto advise on the initiation of a bioethics programme. The Declaration was intended to \nprovide an adequate \u201cframework of principles and procedures to guide states in the \nformulation of their legislation, policies and other instruments in the field of \nbioethics\u201d (article 2a)  The Declaration was produced, and principles agreed upon, in \nan interactive and deliberative manner with world-wide \u2018expert\u2019 participation.  We \nargue that the key issue is not whether the general principles can be exported \nworldwide (in principle they can), but rather how processes of implementation and \ninstitutionalisation should take shape in different social and cultural contexts.  In \nparticular broader publics are not routinely involved in bioethical debate and policy-\nmaking processes worldwide.   \n \n2 \n \nIntroduction \n \nIn an era of globalisation, the technosciences, including genomics, are quickly \ndeveloping and evolving into a worldwide, global phenomenon. Therefore the \nquestion inevitably emerges whether and to what extent bioethics can and should \nbecome a globalised phenomenon as well. 1  Could we somehow articulate a set of \ncore principles or values that ought to be respected worldwide and that could serve \nas a universal guide or blueprint for bioethical regulations for embedding \nbiotechnologies in various countries? International organisations such as UNESCO, \nbut also the Human Genome Organisation\u2019s Ethics Committee (HUGO), could play \nan important role in this respect. The UNESCO declarations on genomics (notably \n\u201cThe Human Genome and Human Rights\u201d Declaration and the \u201cDeclaration on \nBioethics and Human Rights\u201d) can be regarded as interesting examples of such an \neffort.  2 \nAs one of us has pointed out elsewhere, however, this role is far from \nuncontested. 3 In the editorial to a special issue of Developing World Bioethics, the \nUNESCO declaration has been fiercely criticized. 4.. One of the objections raised \nwas that the concepts used in this document are too general and vague to generate \nreal commitment. Moreover, it was argued that the \u201cvalues claimed to be universal \nin this document are, in actual fact, nothing of the sort\u201d 5, and this notably applies to \nconcepts such as \u2018human rights\u2019 and \u2018dignity\u2019. A third important criticism raised by \nthe authors of the editorial was that UNESCO is actually trespassing on other \npeople\u2019s domains. In their opinion, UNESCO is not supposed to set up such \ndeclarations at all. They argue that \u201cwhole articles deal with matters of informed \nconsent in biomedical research and therapeutic practice. It is entirely unclear why \nUNESCO should concern itself with such a matter.\u201d 6 Such activities, they write, are \nthe domain of other organizations or, better still, should be left to the \u201cprofessional \nbioethicists\u201d. In short, UNESCO was denied the competence and qualification to \ndiscuss these things. \nA second example of an international platform engaged in this type of work is \nthe Human Genome Organisation\u2019s (HUGO) Ethics Committee, chaired by Ruth \nChadwick 7. This committee has published an impressive series of statements on \ncore issues concerning the ethical, legal and social aspects of genomics, including \nDNA Sampling (1998), Cloning (1999), Benefit Sharing (2000), Gene Therapy \nResearch (2001), Human Genomic Databases (2002) and Stem Cell Research \n(2004). Its latest statement concerns pharmacogenomics (2007) 8. No doubt, the \nsame kind of criticism that has been levelled at the UNESCO declaration could be \ndirected towards these HUGO statements as well. \nHaving been active ourselves in a series of efforts to promote a more \ninternational and trans-cultural approach in bioethical discourse, we believe that this \nis more than just an academic dispute. The quality and status of international \nbioethical declarations may come to play an important role in addressing the ethical \ndilemmas emerging in the context of international coordinated research efforts now \nand in the near future. Therefore, we want to take the dispute outlined above a step \nfurther by exploring the issue in two directions. First of all, we would like to assess \nwhat might be called the internal validity of the UNESCO declaration. To what \nextent can the criticisms that were made be regarded as fair and sound? Secondly, \nwe want to assess the external validity of the declaration. This is done by reflecting, \nautobiographically as it were, on our professional experiences as \u2018ELSA genomics \nexperts\u2019 involved in bioethical deliberations on an international level. The hard core \n3 \n \nof these experiences is formed by a unique bioethical expedition we joined, \norganised under the auspices of UNESCO, which set out to assess the moral \nsoundness and quality of a genetic screening programme that was carried out among \nindigenous people of North-East Siberia. What role can international bioethical \ndeclarations play in such a situation? In this way we move from the crucially \nimportant task of desk analysis of arguments and concepts to the complementary but \nequally important task of critical reflection on how ethics actually works in practice.  \n \nThe UNESCO declaration and its criticism reconsidered \n \nAn important line of criticism directed against international bioethical declarations \nsuch as the one issued by UNESCO is that its core principles, such as solidarity, \nequity and beneficence, often remain relatively vague, while one may question the \nextent to which these principles can really be regarded as universal, from a bioethics \nperspective. A first important question is, whether this type of criticism is doing \njustice to the genre involved, to the type of document we are dealing with. Although \nthe meanings of some of the key concepts used in this type of documents have been \nelaborated in intricate ways by academic bioethicists in their journals, they are likely \nto play a somewhat different role in the context of international policy development. \nThrough international dialogue on various levels and in various contexts, and \nbuilding on the conceptual efforts of professional bioethicists, declarations intend to \ncontribute to the process of developing the basic framework of a universal bioethics. \nIts basic objective is to set up a network of concepts that may support the difficult \nbut indispensable task of building international policies for science governance (and \nthis includes genomics governance). At a time when genomics research is spreading \nglobally at a high pace, this, one could argue, becomes an urgent task. Undoubtedly, \nacademic bioethics has an important and critical contribution to make to this \nprocess, but this does not deny the relevance and value of international declarations \nas such. \nSince the UNESCO Declaration is criticised for conveying a Western \nideological bias, it is relevant to consider the process by which the declaration was \nproduced and the numbers of individuals and organisations involved.  The mandate \nfor the declaration, from the General Conference of UNESCO in 2003,  \u201cconsiders \nthat it is opportune and desirable to set universal standards in the field of bioethics \nwith due regard for human dignity and human rights and freedoms, in the spirit of \ncultural pluralism inherent in bioethics\u201d 9.  There was a three-month pre-drafting \nconsultation which involved a written consultation with member states and a \nmeeting of the International Bioethics Committee (IBC) to decide on the \ndeclaration\u2019s scope and structure.  After the drafting process (April 2004 to January \n2005) there was another consultation (January to September 2005) including \nnational and regional meetings of experts.   The IBC has 36 members with a \nbalanced geographical representation and cultural diversity. Some countries sent \nmembers with expertise in a particular area, for example, life sciences, social \nscience, law, philosophy or education.  The IBC held a 3-day session with 200 \nparticipants from 70 countries to discuss the declaration and included \nrepresentatives from a variety of governmental and non-governmental organisations \nand National Bioethics Committees. 10  . \nThe opening sentence of the mandate (above) tackles the obvious problem \nwith a declaration intended to be acceptable to the 192 member states of UNESCO; \nhow to gain agreement on any universal standards among diverse cultures. What is \n4 \n \nthe \u2018spirit of cultural pluralism\u2019?  In the preamble the point is made that culture \nshould not be appealed to \u201cat the expense of human rights and fundamental \nfreedoms\u201d. Taking the example of female circumcision, the United Nations \ncondemns it as violating the rights of the child. There has been discussion of  \nsymbolic female circumcision to fulfil the cultural role of preparing girls for \nmarriage, without the accompanying physical and psychological damage. There is \nan awareness of the dangers of simply condemning a practice without understanding \nits cultural role, but of course there may be ethical objections to continuing a \nsymbolic practice, depending on what it is symbolising.  \nIn the special issue of Developing World Bioethics mentioned above, the \neditorial criticised the whole enterprise because the declaration contains principles \nthat are considered as being not universal. In particular dignity is not regarded a \nuniversal principle.  The point made is that there is a European bias. Indeed, \n\u201cEuropean enlightenment philosophy pervades the declaration\u201d. 11 Yet, in the first \nconsultation stage of the declaration a questionnaire was sent out to member states \nasking which fundamental principles should be reaffirmed in the declaration. The \nvalues which all respondents agreed on were dignity, equality, non-discrimination \nand respect for privacy. Out of 67 responses there were eleven from Africa, 8 from \nAsia and the Pacific, 10 from Arab states, 6 from Latin America and the Caribbean, \n10 from Central and Eastern Europe and 21 from Europe and America.  Although an \nanswer to a questionnaire is not strong evidence that fundamental principles are \nuniversally shared, it at least indicates that dignity as a concept is widely \nrecognisable. There were specific references to dignity in written comments on the \ndraft, by, for example, Indonesia and Paraguay.12. For the purposes of a Declaration \nintended to influence governments throughout the world, the recognition and \nacceptability of the fundamental principles by all countries is crucial.   \nThe evidence against the universality of dignity offered in the editorial is an \narticle entitled \u201cDignity is a useless concept\u201d by the US bioethicist Ruth Macklin.13. \nShe argues that dignity means no more than respect for autonomy.   However, she \nnotes that people refer to treating a dead body with dignity and argues that \u201cThis \nsituation clearly has nothing to do with respect for autonomy since the object is no \nlonger a person but a cadaver\u201d.  An alternative view would be that since cadavers \ncannot have autonomy, perhaps dignity is not the same as autonomy and so may be \nused about people without autonomy, including the dying, the very elderly, and \nabout ex-people. As H\u00e4yry and Takala point out, dignity is not defined in the \ndeclaration, nor is its relationship to other principles explained. 14.  This is true of \nother principles, that are \u201cproclaimed\u201d in the Declaration rather than discussed. As \nBenatar and Williams both point out in their respective contributions to the special \nedition, the Declaration is a compromise and the principles are indeed rather vague. \n15. This is, of course, a common criticism of principlism and of the four principles of \nmedical ethics in particular. The principles are necessarily vague in an international \ndeclaration in order to secure agreement by all member states. The declaration is not \nlegally binding and the principles \u201care to be respected\u201d, \u201cshould be given due \nregard\u201d rather than representing obligations. This does not deny that they could \nfunction as guidelines for reviewing or reorganising research practices, for instance \nwhen a country is devising a national system for ethical review of medical research \nfor the first time.  Since all ethical principles are interpreted differently within and \nbetween social and cultural groups and over time, precise definitions, if acceptable, \ncould be too specific to the circumstances when a Declaration is made and therefore \nnot able to be adapted to an unforeseen development.  \n5 \n \nLandman and Sch\u00fcklenk criticise particular articles as \u201cuntenable\u201d. \nReferring to article 3.2 they argue: \u201cSurely it is untenable to say individual\u201ds interest \nshould always have absolute priority over societal interest\u201d 16 op cit, v).  They give \nthe example of public health where it may be necessary to have a proportionate \nrestriction on individuals for the social good and so \u201cnobody in the real world would \ntake article 3b seriously as it stands.\u201d 17 . However article 3.2 actually reads \u201cthe \ninterests and welfare of the individual should have priority over the sole interest of \nscience or society\u201d (authors\u2019 emphasis), but in their comments, the crucial term \n\u201csole\u201d is left out. Subsequently, Landman and Sch\u00fcklenk  state that article 4, if \nadopted, \u201cwould render pretty much all biomedical research impossible.\u201d18 The \narticle reads, \u201cBenefits to participants must be maximised and their possible harms \nminimised\u201d. The editors argue that maximising individual benefit cannot be a \nprimary objective. The primary objective of medical research would be to test a drug \nor a treatment. Although this is obviously right, we do not see why in doing so, \nbenefits should not be maximised and harms should not be minimised. Otherwise, \nhow would you obtain fully informed consent for the trials?  The claim that \u201cmost \nresearchers and research ethics committees would disregard\u201d the clause would, if \ntrue, make it difficult to find healthy volunteers for research, which is apparently \nrefuted by actual practice.  \nThe authors also disagree with Article 11 as there can be no discrimination \nagainst individuals and groups \u201con any grounds\u201d, whereas there may be good \ngrounds to discriminate against, say people with racist views.  However, the clause \ndoes not say \u201con any grounds.\u201d 19. It says \u201cin violation of human dignity, human \nrights and fundamental freedoms\u201d. The example given, of a racist applying to be an \nequal opportunity officer, would be covered by this clause. \nThe crux of  Landman\u2019s and Sch\u00fcklenk\u2019s  dislike of the UNESCO \ndeclaration, however, is that an official organisation is moving into bioethics and \n\u201cBioethics, as we understand it, is an academic discipline and not a playground for \ngovernment appointed politician-experts to muse on in an inconsequential and \narguable not very sophisticated manner about ethics.\u201d 20. Ironically, this line of \nreasoning is not unlike the type of criticism professional bioethicists themselves \noften receive when they start \u2018meddling\u2019 (as members of research ethics committees \nfor instance) with affairs that, according to some, could better be left to the \nprofessionals (in this case, biomedical researchers). Yet, we would argue that \nbioethics is not only an academic discipline. In fact, bioethicists often want to use \ntheir academic credentials to influence policy and practice, for example Schuklenk \nin his work in the area of HIV and AIDS. \nAcademic bioethicists are not the target audience for this declaration, \ngovernments are. Henk ten Have, Director of the Division of Ethics of Science and \nTechnology responsible for the Declaration, is quoted as saying that the Declaration \ndoes not aim to \u201cpromote academic bioethics\u201d. UNESCO aims to use its guidance in \norder to \u201ceducate healthcare professionals and young scientists in ethics, to establish \nethics committees, and create an infrastructure for bioethics\u201d 21. The declaration \nseeks to encourage ethical review of scientific and medical research, consent \nprocedures for research involving human beings, public engagement and debate \naround bioethical issues. Although it may be doubtful whether any group of \nbioethicists would agree on what constitutes a sophisticated argument, the intention \nof the UNESCO document was to act as a basis for member states to create their \nown framework for ethical review and public involvement.  For this purpose the \n6 \n \npublishing of pamphlets, disparaged by Landman and Schuklenk, is more \nappropriate than academic journal articles. \n A final criticism considered here, made by Benatar, is that it is a weakness that \nthe Declaration concentrates on human beings. As Benatar himself points out, \nhowever, this is following the wishes of member countries when the first consultation \nwas carried out. 22. Critics could argue that humans are given privileged status, and \nthey are, but the declaration as it stands does not preclude the elaboration of similar \ndocuments addressing issues of animal ethics or environmental ethics. The ideological \nframework is clearly stated to be human rights and in a declaration addressed to States \nthe focus is on the protection of the individual, over the sole interest of science and \nsociety.  This would be problematic in an international declaration if human rights \ncould be shown to have a Western or European bias. However, while human rights \nmay not be a framework commonly used by \u2018professional bioethicists\u201d.23, it is \nfrequently used by international conventions and declarations and many non-western \ncountries subscribe to human rights legislation. In the special issue from which this \ncriticism is taken, Nie Jing Bao argues that a human rights perspective is not at all \nincompatible with Confucianism or Taoism.24  As we said, the declaration is \naddressed to a broader audience than \u201cprofessional bioethicists\u201d and is intended to be \n\u201ccomprehensible and accessible to everyone\u2026.addressed to both Member States and \nto researchers, scientists, decision-makers and citizens. 25  \n \nLack of attention to social\/cultural context \n \nIt is a very common criticism of bioethics in general that it pays insufficient attention \nto social and cultural contexts. Is it ethically legitimate to argue that certain policies \n\u2018ought\u2019 to be implemented in places where a bioethical infrastructure has been \ninexistent? Bioethicists might argue in journal articles that people ought to be able to \nsell their organs or that sex selection ought to be allowed, but if such arguments are to \neffect policy, should they take into account the political and cultural situation in any \nparticular society? Could we argue in favour of commercialisation on theoretical \ngrounds without ensuring that those who are selling organs are also able to afford the \nnecessary immune suppressant drugs? Can we argue against sex selection in a culture \nwhere giving birth to sons or daughters affects people\u2019s prospects in terms of poverty \nor prosperity? Or can we argue in favour of sex selection (on the basis of \n\u2018reproductive autonomy\u2019 for example) even when this would result in a skewed sex \nratio, with long term social consequences? The declaration is only setting a \nframework within which different societies and cultures can operate, provided they \nadvance anti-discrimination and benefit sharing. There will not be the same \narrangements everywhere. Still, it is stated in the Declaration that the socio-cultural \ncontext cannot be appealed to in order to legitimise marginalization or exclusion.  The \nimportance of public health and environmental provisions is also recognised (article \n14). \nRawlinson and Donchin 26 argue that the declaration does not recognise \ndisparities of power and wealth. Yet, although it does not specify particular \ninequalities, it does mention vulnerable groups and women and children, who have \nunequal access to resources in many countries. The point of the universal declaration \nis to assert that while in any particular society there will be structural inequalities, \neveryone has human rights and in all societies \u201cprogress in science and technology \nshould advance the improvement of living conditions and the elimination of \nmarginalisation and exclusion of persons on any grounds\u201d (article 4). Landman and \n7 \n \nSchuklenk are concerned that characterising groups\/people as vulnerable could be \nharmful to others considered less vulnerable.  However, who the vulnerable groups \nare is an empirical question in any society and could change over time.  It is of course \na common complaint of a dominant group that they are discriminated against when \nthere are special measures for a less powerful group.  Whether or not the complaint is \nupheld should be a matter of examining the evidence.  \nYet, this type of discussion is bound to remain theoretical and academic as \nlong as it takes place on this rather abstract and general level. In order to further \ndevelop the discussion, we would need to study specific examples of how such \ndeclarations function in specific contexts. By doing so the \u2018external\u2019 validity of \ninternational declarations can be tested empirically as it were. We ourselves have \nbeen involved in, and have been greatly intrigued by, the following example of an \neffort to \u2018export\u2019 bioethical principles beyond their usual sphere of influence. And we \nwould like to further develop this debate by drawing on our own experiences. \n \nUNESCO delegation to Siberia \n \nIn May 2005 we were invited (as ELSA genomics experts) to join a UNESCO \ndelegation for a site visit to Yakutsk, Capital of Sakha (also known as Yakutia), \nSiberia, where a genetic screening programme for myotonic dystrophy was being set \nup, - a hereditary muscular disease that is prevalent among indigenous people in \nNorthern Siberia. This screening programme was also of interest in the context of the \nfamous Human Genome Diversity Program, headed by Luca Luigi Cavalli Sforza 27 \nand devoted to studying early human history and migration on the basis of genomic \ndata derived from populations living today, thereby updating information that was \npreviously provided by linguistics, ethnography, anthropology, palaeontology and \narchaeology. The research is notably based on genes coding for blood types (A, B, O \nand Rh) as well as on mitochondrial DNA (\u2018Eve\u2019) and the Y chromosome (\u2018Adam\u2019). \nEastern Siberia (notably its indigenous population) is of some interest in this respect \nbecause it must have constituted part of the bridge that allowed Asian populations to \nmigrate (in three separate waves) into America. The HGDP regards genomes of living \nindividuals (notably of indigenous populations) as deposits of DNA, as \nbioarchaeological files so to speak, so that DNA analysis may provide genetic \nsnapshots of human diversity and history before some of these \u2018endangered \npopulations\u2019 disappear for good. Yakutia is a sparsely populated area in the \npermafrost regions of Siberia, whose inhabitants are mainly dependent upon fishing. \nDiamond mining (recently privatised) is its sole core industry. \nOur job, invited as ELSA experts in the domain of genomics, was to assist in \nthe process of assessing benefits and risks of genetic screening in Yakutia. Basically, \nwe attended a conference devoted to \u201cProblems of the gene pool preservation of \nindigenous people of the North\u201d. The workshop\u2019s main objective was to establish an \nethics committee as well as a bioethics training module for monitoring the screening \nprogramme. \nOn the first day of the conference, some of the ongoing research and screening \nprojects (including lectures on the diversity of mitochondrial DNA and Y \nchromosome lineages in populations in Yakutia) were presented while on the second \nday the focus shifted towards the ethical domain. The workshop was organised by the \nlocal UNESCO unit in collaboration with UNESCO Paris. UNESCO\u2019s involvement \nwas motivated by its objective of \u201censhrining\u201d universal declarations, such as the one \non Bioethics and Human Rights, in which it is recognized that scientific programmes \n8 \n \nmay particularly affect vulnerable indigenous and local communities. In UNESCO \ndeclarations it is stated that screening activities should be conducted on the basis of \nprior, free and informed consent, while benefits resulting from scientific research \nshould be shared with society (for instance in the form of diagnostic facilities or \nsupport for health services). At the end of the workshop a declaration was accepted \nstating that an ethics committee was to be established consisting of members from \nvarious backgrounds and that the work of the committee should be supported by an \non-site training programme. \nAlthough this visit constituted a unique experience, it also raised a number of \nquestions. First of all, the language used by local politicians and physicians during the \ndiscussions was at times uncannily reminiscent of what we in the West would refer to \nas eugenics. One politician for instance proudly announced that the screening \nprogramme for myotonic dystrophy would \u2018cleanse the gene pool\u201d, thus improving \nthe health conditions of a population that had to survive under harsh climatologic \ncircumstances. This raised questions on our part concerning issues such as individual \nand free informed consent. On the other hand, who were we to question the validity \nand quality of their procedures? Could \u2018our\u2019 bioethical views and principles simply be \nexported? In the middle of Yakutsk, a rather desolate and isolated town mainly \nconsisting of quickly deteriorating concrete buildings, an impressive hospital had \nbeen built, funded by the diamond industry, whose very architecture seemed rather \nintimidating, although it could also be interpreted as benefit sharing in the sense of \nproviding people who participated in the screening programme with health facilities. \nWe also noticed that it was difficult to really enter into a discussion of a \ndeliberative, \u2018Western\u2019 type, asking and responding to critical questions. Besides the \nlanguage problem (only a limited number of the people we met spoke either English, \nGerman or French so that in most cases we had to rely on the services of an \ninterpreter, trained and recruited by the diamond company), we noticed a cultural \ndivide as well: posing critical questions seemed somewhat at odds with local \nconventions and was apparently considered impolite. Rather, deliberations assumed \nnarrative forms, exchanging anecdotal information over diner, invariably consisting of \nraw fish, horse tripe and vodka. Finally, last but not least, we felt uneasy about our \nown role, about the possibility that our very presence would serve a symbolic \nfunction, that it could be interpreted as legitimisation the project, - an international \nexpert committee reviewed the programme, therefore its ethical permissibility seemed \nsafeguarded. This was underlined by the fact that contrary to what was emphatically \npromised, there has never been a follow-up. \nInterestingly, the kinds of questions we ourselves had with regard to our visit \nwere not the questions addressed by the critics of UNESCO declarations cited above. \nIn our view, the issue was not whether or not informed consent or human dignity can \nbe meaningful and valid ethical principles at all, - they obviously can. Our worries \nand concerns could easily be articulated in these terms, notwithstanding the intricate \nbioethical discussions concerning the precise meaning of these terms that take place in \nanalytically oriented bioethics journals. Our basic concerns rather had to do with \npower issues and procedural issues than with conceptual ones, with the power plays \nwe had somehow entered, the meaning and impact, not of the terms we used, but \nrather of our very presence. In bioethical discussions the focus often tends to be on the \ncontent and meaning of basic concepts, their conceptual validity. What tends to be \nneglected, but what we found much more relevant and important, are issues of \nimplementation and institutionalisation. The question is not \u2018what is\u2019 dignity (for \ninstance), but rather: how can principles such as dignity or informed consent become \n9 \n \nan integral part of research and screening practices, - and who should play a role in \nthis implementation process (scientists, policy makers, ethicists, or rather the public at \nlarge?), notably in areas such as Yakutia where there is no such thing as a functioning \nbioethical infrastructure. How are ethical deliberations to be organised? For instance: \nthe question is not whether our lectures on informed consent were conceptually \nadequate (we believe they were). Rather, the question was how did they function, \nwhat impact did they have, and, finally, how to involve the broader public in \ndesigning screening policies? While the workshop was attended by researchers, \nphysicians, policy makers and bioethics experts, Sakha citizens as such were absent. \nAs was stated above, one of the strengths of the UNESCO declaration is that it \nis the outcome of a process of intricate deliberations. It was not written at the desk of \na bioethics expert, but rather in an interactive manner. Its weakness no doubt is that \nbesides ethicists only government representatives and NGOs were allowed to \ncontribute to this process. In many European countries consultative processes to \naccess lay knowledge and expertise are well established and routinely undertaken by \ngovernmental bodies and NGOs as well as under the European Union Framework \nprogrammes (e.g. European Commission, 2005; Nuffield Council on Bioethics; \nHuman Fertilisation and Embryology Authority HFEA 28.). In 2003 for instance, the \nHFEA (UK regulatory body) decided against allowing sex selection for non-medical \nreasons and admitted to having been influenced in their conclusions by the views \ncollected in a representative poll as well as by responses to their public consultation.29  \nInterestingly, the HFEA was criticised by bioethicist John Harris 30 for, among other \nthings, accepting public hostility to sex selection \u201cat face value\u201d. No doubt, the \nprocedure adopted by the HFEA is still some way from a genuinely bottom up \napproach, since the public were asked to react to issues pre-framed by the HFEA. 31. \nNonetheless, the willingness to consider more interactive methods for designing \nregulations and declarations seems wide-spread. Could it be that in the future the \nproduction of statements will involve broader publics. Could \u2018bottom-up\u2019 \nmethodologies be extended or extrapolated from the national to the international level \nin order to achieve these goals?  \nReflecting on our experiences we may conclude that the Yakutia experience \ndemonstrated for us in a rather vivid manner both the strengths and the weaknesses of \ninternational bioethical declarations. The Declaration could have been an appropriate \ntool for the regulation of biotechnologies in the sense that it provided a framework \nwithin which a country like Yakutia could devise specific arrangements. Thus, it \nconstituted a starting point for a first assessment, a first exploration of unknown \nterritory. The weakness was, however, that we did not come much further than that, \nand that a declaration, instead of giving impetus to a thorough reflection on emerging \nquandaries, may also be used as an instance of \u2018ethics theatre\u2019, setting the stage for an \nencounter that merely served ritualistic purposes. For indeed, in practice what was \nproduced was yet another formal declaration rather than specific arrangements to \nembody the articles of the Declaration on informed consent, the right to refuse to take \npart in research, opportunities for pluralistic public debate and so on.  \n \nFrom bioethics to public involvement? \n \nAt this point we would like to introduce a second example, once again borrowing \nfrom personal experience. On November 2007 a delegation of bioethics experts from \nChina visited the Netherlands. The highlight was a Chinese-Dutch symposium on the \nsocietal aspects of genomics in Utrecht, November 5. Contributions from the \n10 \n \nNetherlands tended to focus on cultural and ethical differences between West and \nEast. In a recent report, for instance, Van den Belt and Keulartz 32 had noticed that, in \ndiscussions on bioethics in East Asia, including China, the \u2018Wild East\u2019 argument \nfigures quite prominently, i.e. the claim that, because bioethical regulations in the East \nare supposed to be less severe than in the West, combined with a much more \ntechnology-friendly cultural climate, Asian researchers are less hindered by bioethical \nbureaucracies as well as by moral scruples and fears about the possible consequences \nof new technologies for society or the environment. Moreover, whereas the West is \ndominated by the language of autonomy, individual rights and informed consent, in \ncountries like China \u2018Asian\u2019 values are supposedly more important, and this includes \nConfusian values such as \u2018familialism\u2019.  The People\u2019s Republic of China occupies a \nremarkable position in the debate on Asian values, not only because of the  impressive \nnumber of inhabitants of this gigantic country, but also because, on closer \nexamination, the Asian values such as familialism are often specified as Confucian \nvalues. 33. These differences between the West and the Far East seem to undermine \nthe prospects for a universal bioethics as a complementary efforts that should \naccompany bioscientific and genomics developments worldwide. \nFrom the side of the Chinese delegation, however, this picture was challenged. \nThey argued that, although it is true that in China professional bioethics is still a \nrelatively small-scale phenomenon, this does not mean that in their country \u2018anything \ngoes\u2019. Moreover, rather than cultivating \u2018Asian\u2019 values, these Chinese bioethicists are \nbasically involved in elaborating an ethic that is quite in line with the international \nlingua franca, the ethics of autonomy, individual rights and informed consent. Indeed, \nthe Chinese delegation claimed that phrases like Asian values are hardly ever \nmentioned in Asian debates.  Renzong-Qui, who has long been an influential figure in \nChinese bioethics, has argued for \u2018moderate ethical universalism and moderate ethical \nrelativism\u2019 and that he \u2018personally... favour[s] the rights approach, because in a \ndeveloping country like China, there has been a longstanding tradition in ethics that \nthe dominant talks are duty-oriented but without rights\u2019.34. The Bangkok declaration \n(1993) signed by representatives of 30 Asian governments  stressed the \u201cuniversality, \nobjectivity and non-selectivity of all human rights and the need to avoid the \napplication of double standards in the implementation of human rights and its \npoliticisation\u201d.35  Adorno acknowledges the European origins of the human dignity \nand human rights framework and the sometimes \u2018excessive emphasis\u2019 on individual \nrights in the west as opposed to family and community values. However, he argues \nthat the opposition of western and non-western values, and of universal human rights \nand cultural diversity, \u2018have lost much of their practical significance\u2019.  Non-western \ncountries increasingly sign up to, and take part in the formulation of human rights \ntreaties and there is sufficient flexibility in these agreements to be compatible with \ncultural diversity. 36  \nDiscussions such as this one are important against the backdrop of the way in \nwhich bioscience, notably genomics, is evolving. It is becoming a world-wide, global \nphenomenon as we said, and insofar as biotechnology and genomics are globalising, \nthis also seems to call for an international or even global bioethics. The key question \nthan is the extent to which the bioethical model as it has emerged under specific \ncultural and societal conditions in the West, can be extrapolated to others cultural \nrealms. Can bioethics be regarded an \u2018export product\u2019?  \nIronically, while this discussion is evolving, the traditional bioethics model as \nit had emerged in the 1980s in Western countries such as the Netherlands and the UK \nis now increasingly under pressure in these countries themselves. Traditional \n11 \n \nbioethics not only involved ethical principles such as autonomy and informed consent, \nbut also the institutionalisation and professionalisation of bioethics as a practice, in \nthe form of bioethics experts, bioethics committees, bioethics journals, bioethics \ncourses and bioethics research institutes. In the 1990s, however, the ethical expert-\nmodel became challenged. The interest began to shift from formulating and applying \nethical \u2018principles\u2019 towards developing methodologies for involving publics and \nsocietal stakeholders in bioethical debates. The ethical expert-model increasingly had \nto compete with more interactive strategies for science policy, based on various forms \npublic engagement. One of the problems of the ethical expert model was that it \nseemed difficult to explain who the ethicists represented and on what body of \nknowledge their expertise was based.  \nTo the extent that traditional bioethics is being replaced, or at least \ncomplemented, with a variety of interactive methodologies and consultations, the \nsame question that was formulated above re-emerges. Can a more interactive \napproach to the various bioethical issues as it has developed in genomics and the \nbiosciences be \u2018exported\u2019? Can some of these evolving methodologies become a \nmodel for bioethical debate elsewhere? Apparently, these methodologies seem even \nharder to transfer that the key concepts of bioethics as such. Besides differences in \nterms of political systems (such as the one-party system versus a multiple party \nsystem) and communicative culture (some cultures may be regarded as \u201cnarrative\u201d \nrather than \u201cdeliberative\u201d for example), the most obvious problem is no doubt the \nproblem of size. Compared to the Netherlands, China is an incredibly huge country, a \nwhole world. What would public engagement or public participation mean under such \nconditions?   \n \nConcluding remarks on formulating bioethics policies  \n \nThe UNESCO declaration aims to provide an adequate \u2018framework of principles and \nprocedures to guide states in the formulation of their legislation, policies and other \ninstruments in the field of bioethics\u2019 (article 2a).  Such a document is produced \nfollowing a process of worldwide consultation with representatives of member states \nand experts and necessarily includes some compromise and vagueness in order to \nachieve consensus.  Its value can only be judged by its influence. For states that do \nnot have a structure of ethical review of research or public consultation on bioethical \nissues, the declaration could be used as a starting point to develop such structures. \n At the same time, it is clear that putting together declarations is only one way \nto contribute to the effort of producing a global bioethics, on the basis of dialogue. Its \nbasic objective is to stimulate rather than to conclude or forgo bioethical \ndeliberations. Moreover, methodologies for public engagement will no doubt become \nincreasingly important on the international level as well. The question than becomes \nwhether they may profit from such declarations (and vice versa) and how broader \npublics can become involved in declaration development. \n Finally, it is clear that these types of discussion will remain rather academic as \nlong as they take place on a rather abstract and general level. What is needed is \nempirical on-site research in the functioning of declarations, notably in countries \nwhere biotechnologies developments are relatively new and the institutionalisation of \nbioethics still finds itself in a relatively early stage of development. How will \nactivities to promote and \u2018export\u2019 declaration work in practice, notably under \ncircumstances where bioethical professionalism is still sparse?  \n \n12 \n \n1. Zwart H.
