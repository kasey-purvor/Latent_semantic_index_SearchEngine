These articles incite us to look beyond theories \nof human rights which accept rights as static and activists as unreflective workers \ntowards an uncontested ideal. Instead, they show rights to be a dynamic, political, \npotentially (still) radical concept that shifts in meaning between historical contexts \nand in the hands of the various players in the human rights field. \n \nAs noted in the Introduction, the idea for this section began with a panel at the 2010 \nInternational Studies Association conference, at which we discussed whether and how \ntheorists and activists could be brought closer together. Despite the focus of this \nsection having changed from theorists and activists to ideal and practical politics, \nsome of the same assumptions about the need to probe the relationship between these \nactors remain. A number of interesting points came out of the ISA discussion, the \nmost important being the question of whether it is a wise idea to bring these two \ngroups into closer proximity in the first place. It is certainly fashionable in these cash-\nstrapped times when academics are being asked to ensure that their work has \u2018impact\u2019 \nin the \u2018real world\u2019. So the benefit to theorists of a closer engagement is quite clear \u2013 a \nbetter understanding of how human rights are actually fought for and achieved (if this \nis something that interests them), plus the possibility of being looked at more \nfavourably by funding councils. There is also likely to be (and I\u2019ll come to this later) a \nmore general benefit to theorising from engagement in practice. But is there any \nbenefit to the activist? Or does theory tend to threaten more than bolster activism?  \n \nI argued then as I do now that the practices of theorising about human rights and \n\u2018doing\u2019 human rights, while they may at times be undertaken by the same agents, have \ndifferent logics and incommensurable goals. Theory and practice are not \ndichotomous, but theory and activism are analytically separable (usefully so, as \nshown by Joe Hoover and Marta I\u00f1iguez de Heredia and by Robin Redhead and Nick \nTurnbull) and by thinking about them as different practices we can see that the activist \nis more likely to be threatened by theory than the theorist by activism. Professional \ntheorists are (rightly or wrongly) paid to be uncertain \u2013 to probe the boundaries of \nconcepts, to find inconsistencies, to undermine and to expose \u2013 as Jenna Reinbold \ndemonstrates in her depiction of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as \nfoundationless political mythmaking. The conviction of the converted is of interest to \ntheorists, but unlikely in and of itself to affect their own uncertainty. Activists, on the \nother hand, require a level of certainty in order to act, particularly if they are to justify \nviolent action towards achieving human rights goals, and are therefore susceptible to \ntheir activism being suffocated by doubt. Any benefit to the activist of being brought \ncloser to the theorist is to be found in increasing certainty (assuming, as many do, that \neventually theorists of human rights will reach agreement about what these universal \nrights are and how they should be defended). Yet the output of human rights \ntheorising so far seems too tentative, too diverse, too fractious to be of benefit to \nactivism \u2013 and the articles in this section give little reason to think that this will \nchange. \n \n1 \n \nThe contributors do not see activists and theorists as separate groups, or perhaps even \nas participating in separate practices. Brooke Ackerly suggests that activists should \nalso be theorists (or should at least engage in serious critical reflection on their \nactivism). Redhead and Turnbull argue that many activists are also theorists, just as \nmany theorists are also activists, and as such do not seem to experience the \ncontradictions in purpose outlined above (although Redhead and Turnbull\u2019s research \ndid not explicitly investigate this). Certainly it is the case that many activists do \ncritically reflect upon their work and are fully cognisant of the latest theoretical \nstatements on human rights. So is the link closer and more beneficial than I have \nintimated? Actors who see themselves as both theorists and activists may use the \nuncertainty of theory in order to critique and develop their conception of human rights \nand how to achieve rights goals, and in their activism they will almost certainly \nencounter uncertainty. But my sense from reading accounts of Redhead and \nTurnbull\u2019s interviewees is that their reflection does not extend all the way down to \nfirst principles about whether the rights they fight for exist \u2013 and neither should it if \nwe expect them to continue their fight (though we may, following Hoover and I\u00f1iguez \nde Heredia, want them to question the power structures that their activism takes place \nwithin and contributes to sustaining). These theorist-activists may question whether \nrights are being achieved in the most effective manner, or whether the correct rights \nor target populations are being prioritised at any given time, but to question the \nexistence of rights themselves would surely disqualify them from the role of human \nrights activist. The goal of the activist remains concrete action and attainment borne \nof conviction \u2013 a conviction the theorist must reject as part of the practice of \ncontemporary academia. For human rights organisations, the mark of success in a \ncampaign is often the writing into law of particular rights \u2013 precisely to limit the \nscope of uncertainty around rights claims or permissible challenges to them. Put more \nstrongly still, for many supporters of the idea of human rights, the function of such \nrights as fixed kernels of moral truth is to limit the power plays and contingencies of \npolitics, and the sprawl of disengaged theorising. Within the practice of human rights \nactivism, to question publically the very existence of these rights is close to \nsacrilegious, for reasons well-described by Reinbold. Theory, in its guise here of \n\u2018ideal politics\u2019, may be used to justify a destination point and route\/s to get there, but \nnot to put the journey itself in jeopardy.  \n \nBut what of the practical politics that the contributors to a large extent focus upon? \nAll of the articles here complicate, quite rightly, assumptions made in conventional \nstudies of human rights, and challenge us to understand the rights movement and its \nprincipal actors in new ways. I support this endeavour wholeheartedly, particularly \nthe focus on what is actually done in the name of human rights and how this is \njustified in amongst the cacophony of political demands made in particular times and \nplaces. But in mounting their challenge, the articles suggest a number of new \nquestions (and some old ones) that must be asked if we are to engage substantively \nwith the \u2018practical politics\u2019 of human rights.   \n \nThe first question raised, or perhaps more accurately, not avoided, is an old one: what \nare rights? The approaches exemplified in the preceding articles use sociology and \nhistory more than philosophy to understand rights, and it is perhaps inevitable that \nthese literatures will lead to differing views about what rights are. The authors of the \narticles in this section seem to disagree both about what rights are generally and about \nwhat they are at any given point in time, even if they do largely agree about how we \n2 \n \ncan know either of these things. Ackerly argues that reflection alone cannot establish \nwhat rights are \u2013 only understanding the practices that promote and sustain the \nenjoyment of rights can lead us to know what rights are, suggesting, alongside Hoover \nand I\u00f1iguez de Heredia, that rights vary across contexts. Yet Ackerly also sets out \nsome significant and contested features of rights within her article which suggest a \nmuch more fixed or universal view of rights. Rights are presented as necessarily \ncommensurate with each other \u2013 indivisible and interrelated \u2013 but there is no reason to \nthink that they will be if we follow Hoover and I\u00f1iguez de Heredia or Reinbold. \nHoover and I\u00f1iguez de Heredia\u2019s account of moralised politics suggests that rights \ncan and almost certainly will clash. Ackerly could respond by arguing that the actors \nidentified by Hoover and I\u00f1iguez de Heredia are not actually promoting rights \nenjoyment even though they are (at least at times) using the language of rights, but the \nHoover and I\u00f1iguez de Heredia position is much more radical. They would, I think, \nreject the view that there are correct and incorrect ways to promote rights, favouring \ninstead an analysis that sees rights as always and inherently contested, unavoidably \nambiguous, necessarily part of politics and bound up with power, and having \nfundamentally different meanings according to the social conditions within which \nwhich they are invoked. Reinbold, through her depiction of the UDHR as embedded \nwithin the barbarism of Nazi Germany and the Second World War, but malleable \nenough to stretch across a range of situations which provoke \u2018moral outrage\u2019, shows \nthat the supposed self-evidence of rights is something which is and must be constantly \nremade.  \n \nAll contributors, therefore, agree that rights become tangible in practice, even if they \ndisagree about the extent to which rights are contextually located and bound. Yet if \nthe way to understand rights is through practice, then what is the practice of human \nrights and who are the actors within it? At various points in the articles the authors \n(for ease and succinctness no doubt) treat human rights practice as a coherent whole. \nYet, as Ackerly acknowledges, any organisation (and in fact any activist) can describe \ntheir work as rights-based. They are incentivised to do so by the positioning of human \nrights claims in the transcendent centre of international morality, as detailed by \nReinbold. The sheer number of actors and actions who claim to work in the field of \nhuman rights (and the sheer number who don\u2019t, but who authors such as Redhead and \nTurnbull and Hoover and I\u00f1iguez de Heredia identify as part of the practice), the \ndifferent roles taken by these actors, the different types of motivations they have and \nthe different claims that they make add up to a tremendously complicated field. For \nall that it may be useful to consider the practical politics of human rights, it may be \nthat there is no singular practice of human rights at all.  \n \nThe appeal of studying this field in terms of practice is clear and well-justified in the \narticles, and the literature on the \u2018practice turn\u2019 in International Relations is \nburgeoning.1 But the literature is not yet settled on what practices are, nor how to find \n                                                 \n1 See, for instance, Emanuel Adler (2005) Communitarian International Relations: The epistemic \nfoundation of International Relations, London\/New York: Routledge; Mervyn Frost (2009) Global \nEthics, Abingdon\/ New York: Routledge;  Iver Neumann (2002) \u2018Returning Practice to the Linguistic \nTurn: The Case of Diplomacy\u2019, Millennium: Journal of International Studies 31 (3):627-652; Vincent \nPouliot (2010) International Security in Practice, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; and the \nprogrammes of just about all major international relations conferences over the last two years. Vincent \nPouliot and Emmanuel Adler\u2019s forthcoming edited collection on International Practices (Cambridge, \n2011) promises to showcase the state of the art in the practice turn.  \n3 \n \ntheir edges. Practices can be seen as spheres of activity or as types of action, and \npractice theorists approach their studies using Ludwig Wittgenstein, Michael \nOakeshott, Alasdair MacIntyre, Pierre Bourdieu and even occasionally Charles \nManning and Hedley Bull.2 These theorists have highly divergent accounts of \npractice, and many methods to identify and study it. An explicit engagement with this \nliterature, as started in Redhead and Turnbull\u2019s paper, will be necessary as study of \nthe practical politics of human rights progresses. At the same time, some justification \nmust be given for where the boundaries of human rights practice are assumed to lie. \nAcross the articles in the section, philosophers, theorists, activists, radicals, \ncommunity workers, people in struggle, lawyers, politicians or policy makers and \nbureaucrats are all seen as possible practitioners of human rights. But to assume all of \nthese actors, with all of the political positions they take, values they stand for and \npurposes they claim, to be involved in a single sphere of action or to share common-\nsense or habitual ways of acting would lose much of the depth and richness that an \nanalysis of practice promises. \n \nAckerly notes, in her first footnote, that human rights advocacy might be thought of as \na \u2018global industry\u2019. It may be that this conceptualisation is a more viable way to study \nthe practical politics of human rights, that is, as an industry or field in which there are \na range of different practices each performed by a range of different actors. \nFundraising practices, for instance, might differ markedly from international- and \nstate level policy making practices (which will also differ across states). Lawyers are \nlikely to advocate for human rights in different ways and with different goals than \nZapatista revolutionaries. And if we broaden the field from advocacy to include the \nentire human rights industry, then the practices of academics who write about rights \nalso come into view. An approach which differentiates between practices within an \nindustry or field of human rights would also allow exploration of whether and how \nsome practices are more sedimented or institutionalised than others \u2013 something \ntouched upon by Redhead and Turnbull\u2019s analysis, and important if there is thought to \nbe benefit in analysing all practices, large and small, which feed into the grand \ninternational- and state institutional structures built around ideas of rights. \n \nAckerly sets out a way to evaluate existing practices to establish whether or not they \ndo in fact promote human rights enjoyment, with the aim of providing theory that is \naction-guiding, and concludes that only those actors who promote \u2018the enjoyment of \nindivisible rights of inter-related humanity, through \u2026 challenging not only the rights \nviolating behaviour of individual actors but also the social, economic, and political \nbarriers to rights enjoyment\u2019 can be said to have a rights-based approach (INSERT \nPAGE REF FROM PROOFS).  A benefit of this approach is to exclude a number of \nactors and organisations who claim to work in the field of human rights from analysis, \nand therefore make the field more manageable to the researcher. Yet the actors \nexcluded might include those groups who work on small or single issue areas within \nthe field and are not sufficiently inclusive \u2013 actors, perhaps, such as those interviewed \n                                                 \n2 Cornelia Navari\u2019s recent work sorts through these influences and considers their implications. Navari \n(2010) \u2018The Concept of Practice in the English School\u2019, paper presented to International Studies \nAssociation conference, New Orleans, March;  Navari (2010) \u2018Getting from Social Practices to Ethical \nPractices\u2019 SGIR 7th Pan-European International Relations Conference, Stockholm, September. The \nIntroduction to Vincent Pouliot and Emmanuel Adler\u2019s edited collection on \u2018International Practices\u2019 \n(Cambridge, 2011) acknowledges that there is no single theory of practice, but rather a variety of \ntheories which focus on practice.  \n4 \n \nby Redhead and Turnbull and identified (quite justifiably in the piece) as involved in \nhuman rights action. The two articles have different objectives \u2013 one to understand \nactors they perceive to be participating in human rights practice, and one to evaluate \nwho may be so identified \u2013 but each has a valuable goal. Hoover and I\u00f1iguez de \nHeredia muddy the waters even further by including within the field of human rights \nactors who do not acknowledge the moral authority of those rights and who do not use \nthe vocabulary of rights, or do so only strategically. This certainly makes the analysis \nof human rights practice a formidable task, both conceptually and methodologically. \nBut taking such a broad sweep in defining human rights practice does expose both the \nubiquity of ideas of rights and, rather unexpectedly, their counter-hegemonic potential \nto foster and support radical change. \n \nThe final, but perhaps most profound, questions these articles provoke centre around \nthe lack of a call to action from the authors. Doesn\u2019t the argument in the articles entail \naction? Is it not an implication of the arguments presented that as theory and practice, \nthe ideal and the practical, are so intimately connected, then there is little point in us \ncontinuing to write scholarly articles about human rights unless we are also engaged \nin \u2018doing\u2019 human rights (even while recognising the risks to activism posed by a \ncharge of the theory brigade). Of course, writing is doing in itself \u2013 theorising already \ngoes some way to constituting the meaning of human rights at any given time. But if \nwe are to view human rights as fundamentally about practice, then what, if anything, \ncan we usefully say unless we are directly involved in that practice? As Alasdair \nMacIntyre has argued, the way to get out of the theory bunker (and, incidentally, to \nsee the range of ethical possibilities available to us beyond the fragmenting and \ncontradictory morality of advanced capitalist modernity) is not just to engage with the \nliterature of anthropology or sociology or history, but to get involved. He sees \u2018[a] \nprior and continuing engagement with a variety of practices and a reflective grasp of \nwhat\u2019s involved in such engagement\u2019 as necessary to good moral philosophy and \ndesires to see on the curriculum vitae of candidates for academic posts in philosophy \nevidence of their \u2018relevant experiences on farms and construction sites, in laboratories \nand studios, in soccer teams and string quartets, in political struggles and military \nengagements.\u20193 The articles collected here accept (to greater and lesser extent) that \nrights mean what they mean according to the practice or practices they are embedded \nor pursued within. But shouldn\u2019t that acceptance lead us, as readers, to require of the \nauthors a close engagement with at least some aspects of these practices? Shouldn\u2019t \nwe require evidence not just of the analytical abilities of the authors, but also their \nexperience on the front line of human rights politics? To do so would require a step \nchange in our approach to judging academic arguments, and an acceptance that \ntheorists and their work exhibit a complex mix of conviction and abstraction \u2013 a mix \nthat should be beneficial to the analysis of the political practice of human rights. It is a \ntruth (near) universally acknowledged that \u2018theory is always for someone and for \nsome purpose\u2019, but the recognition of the specific purposes or politics of particular \ntheorists, and assessments of theory in light of the practices engaged in by theorists, \nare still some way off. The articles in this section demonstrate why it is necessary; all \nvaluable contributions to a vanguard movement seeking innovative ways to explore \nand understand human rights. \n                                                 \n3 Alasdair MacIntyre (2009) \u201cOn having survived the academic moral philosophy of the twentieth \ncentury\u201d.
