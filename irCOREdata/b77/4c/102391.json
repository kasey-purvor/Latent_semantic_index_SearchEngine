Technology advances\nsuch as high-speed processors and small size\nhigh-capacity storage discs bring exciting new\nmultimedia services such as entertainment and\ngames, and enable their delivery to cheap termi-\nnals at affordable prices to the consumer. Cus-\ntomer demands thus increase and, with them,\ntraffic growth in networks. In order to cope with\nthis avalanche effect, communication systems\nmust evolve either within themselves or via the\ncreation of completely new networks suited to\nthe new service provisions. This article concerns\nthis evolution and the provision of a range of\nnew multimedia services in an efficient, secure,\nand cost-effective environment. The premise is\nthat this can only be accomplished by integration\nof networks, specifically integration of terrestrial\nand satellite networks\nSatellite broadcasting and mobile satellite sys-\ntems to cover air and sea are established mar-\nkets, but elsewhere satellites have not been\nshown to compete well with terrestrial service\nprovision. However, we should recall the unique\nfeatures of satellites: wide area coverage and\nspeed to deliver new services to the market.\nThese will be key to the delivery of affordable\nfuture services and the choice of satellite as the\npreferred delivery mechanism.\nDue to the dominance of Internet-based mul-\ntimedia applications and changing customer\ntrends, and hence changing market and business\nmodels [1], satellites cannot afford to focus on a\nspecific type of service as in the past. From a\ntechnical point of view, delivery can be split into\ntwo service types: fixed and mobile. The two\ntypes of delivery mechanism, unicast and broad-\ncast\/multicast, are applicable to both service cat-\negories depending on the number of pieces of\nuser equipment receiving the same multimedia\ncontent from the same source at the same time.\nFrom the wide area perspective, the satellite\ncan still maintain exclusive status in the tradi-\ntional maritime and aeronautical markets due to\nits unique coverage feature. Wide area coverage\nhas in the past meant lower powers and hence\npoor efficiency. As the demand grows from pas-\nsenger vehicles for broader-band multimedia ser-\nvices, satellites need to become more efficient in\ntheir delivery, exploiting new technologies such\nas multibeam antennas and onboard processing.\nIn the coverage of land masses satellites do\nnot have such exclusivity. Both fixed and mobile\nBARRY EVANS, UNIVERSITY OF SURREY; MARKUS WERNER AND ERICH LUTZ, DLR\nMICHEL BOUSQUET, SUPAERO; GIOVANNI E.

Lessons from the\npast indicate that satellites are successful as a\nresult of their wide area coverage or speed to\nmarket for new services. Niche areas such as\ncoverage of air and sea will persist, but for land\nmasses convergence of fixed, mobile, and broad-\ncasting will dictate that the only way forward for\nsatellites is in an integrated format with terrestri-\nal systems. We outline future ways forward for\nsatellites, and discuss the research challenges\nand technology advances needed to facilitate this\nintegrated approach.\nINTEGRATION OF SATELLITE AND\nTERRESTRIAL SYSTEMS IN\nFUTURE MULTIMEDIA COMMUNICATIONS\nEVANS LAYOUT  10\/6\/05  12:44 PM  Page 72\n \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Eighty\npercent of the world\u2019s population lives in urban\/\nsuburban areas, covering 20 percent of the world\nsurface area. Therefore, satellite can only target\n20 percent of the population if the satellite\nindustry relies on rural and remote areas This\nmay be even less if we consider Europe, in which\nGSM has reached 88 percent of the territory and\naddresses 97 percent of the total population in\nFrance, which has the largest land mass and is\nthe most sparsely populated country in Europe.\nThe rollout of the new third-generation (3G)\nmobile networks (e.g., Universal Mobile\nTelecommunications System [UMTS] in Europe)\nis in its infancy. Here speed could be an edge for\nsatellites in the early stages, but this competitive\napproach is not ultimately sustainable. Thus, the\nidea of complementary coverage between terres-\ntrial in urban\/suburban areas and satellite in\nrural areas is logical, and such integrated provi-\nsion would seem to be attractive.\nHowever, there is possibly a more appropriate\nopportunity for satellites in the mobile arena aris-\ning from recent increased demand for multicast\nand broadcast services on the move. Here again\nwe return to the basic advantages of satellites:\nwide area coverage and speed of new services to\nmarket. Considering the inherent difficulty of effi-\ncient provision of multicast\/broadcast services\nwith smaller 3G cellular systems, we conclude\nthat this is a perfect role for satellites, which can\nnow serve tens of millions of users and thus move\nfrom their traditional niche to the mass market.\nHowever, users do not want multiple terminals,\nso real efficiency only results from integrating this\nservice with other 3G services being provided ter-\nrestrially. This is the cooperative service delivery\napproach in which we integrate the two service\ntypes into a single terminal. In order to provide\ncoverage in urban areas, it is necessary to relay\nthe satellite transmissions via some of the base\nstations, but in the adjacent mobile satellite ser-\nvice (MSS) bands. Of course, it is possible to\ndeliver multicast\/broadcast by other means, e.g.,\nterrestrial digital audio broadcasting (DAB) and\ndigital video broadcasting-mobile (DVB-H) stan-\ndards, but integration is still key, and economics\nwill dictate which system eventually wins out.\nThese are all examples of the convergence of\nmobile and broadcasting.\nTurning now to fixed rather than mobile sys-\ntems, we note that the heritage of satellite has\nbeen the point-to-point (unicast) transoceanic\nhigh-capacity connections between major opera-\ntors. As technology has advanced via digital opti-\ncal submarine cables, this once exclusive satellite\nmarket has diminished to one of largely backup\nor diversification. The dot.com boom of the mid-\n1990s and the dependence on the Internet for\nday-to-day activities has increased traffic demands\nfrom Internet service providers (ISPs). Satellites\nhave responded to this rapid demand by provid-\ning high-capacity digital IP circuits at a speed\nthat could not be matched terrestrially in the\ndeveloped world, and may never be in the devel-\noping world. Operators in this arena have already\nembraced the integrated approach by using the IP\nprotocols with only minor fixes to get them to\nwork over satellite. Thus, they offer the full range\nof services almost seamlessly between terrestrial\nand satellite in the core network.\nWhile satellites have found their place within\nthe core network, what about the access network?\nHere we have a similar scenario to that in the\nmobile network. The initial rollout of broadband\nfixed access (digital subscriber line [xDSL] cable\nor broadband wireless access [BWA]) was slow,\nand satellite was able to fill the speed to market\nniche in some areas. However, just as with GSM,\nin most developed countries terrestrial rollout has\nnow caught up with demand, and satellite is rele-\ngated to countries with difficult geographies and\nextremely rural areas. In these, the markets and\nrevenue potential are smaller. The ability for\nsatellite to compete head on with terrestrial in\ndeveloped countries relies on major efficiency\nimprovements in future satellites, discussed fur-\nther later in this article. This would again point us\nto integration as the way forward and imply that\ncommon standards that allow interchangeable\nprovision between the two domains must be\ndeveloped. This, however, requires operators and\nequipment manufacturers to think in terms of\ncooperation rather than competition.\nReturning to the advantages of satellites, and\nwide coverage broadcast services. Satellite TV\nbroadcasting has, perhaps obviously, been a last-\ning and major success. Direct-to-home digital\nbroadcasting via satellite accounts for 80 percent\nof the provision of service in Europe where\nDVB standards S and S2 have been extremely\nsuccessful in the delivery of affordable mass\nmarket terminal equipment. This is the one area\nin which satellite has been in the vanguard over\ncable and radio. It is interesting to note that\nalthough limited interactivity is provided, the\nfeedback channels are normally terrestrial (some\nintegration here). The extension of the DVB\nstandards to a return channel via satellite (RCS)\nhas not yet been as successful because it is still\ninefficient and uneconomic for the mass market.\nHowever, such systems do have the potential to\nprovide integrated broadband access and TV\nservices in the future. Several U.S. [2] as well as\nEuropean industry analysts [3] have also spotted\nIt is possible to \ndeliver the \nmulticast\/broadcast\nby other means,\nsuch as terrestrial\ndigital audio \nbroadcasting and dig-\nital video\nbroadcasting-mobile\nstandards, but\nintegration is still the\nkey, and economics\nwill dictate which\nsystem eventually\nwins out.\nn Figure 1.

Using these, we propose a\nfuture integrated network architecture scenario\nand finally address the technology advances\nneeded to realize it.\nTECHNOLOGY TRENDS AND\nTERRESTRIAL NETWORK VISIONS\nNowadays people depend more and more on\nadvanced communication technologies such as\nthe Internet, computers, and mobile phones, and\nwould like to have these technologies anywhere\nand at any time. The requirements born from\nthis specific demand can be listed as follows:\n\u2022 Access to all types of telecommunication ser-\nvices\n\u2022 A single device to communicate with different\nnetworks\n\u2022 A single number (or IP address)\n\u2022 A single bill for all services with reduced cost\n\u2022 Reliable wireless access even in the failure of\none or more networks\nThese requirements push today\u2019s vertical net-\nwork approach with single services toward a hor-\nizontal network approach with multiservices, as\nshown in Fig. 3.\nIn order to implement this horizontal approach,\nthe telecommunication industry is searching for a\ngeneric radio access network connected to a uni-\nfied IP-based core network. The difficulty is that\nthere are already several access technologies avail-\nable, and these have been developed independent-\nly for special purposes. Therefore, interworking\nbetween different access systems is becoming a\nkey issue for future systems.\nEven though the different access systems have\nbeen developed separately, they do complement\neach other under a layered concept, as shown in\nFig. 4, in terms of coverage and capacity. The\nbroadcast layer will have the capability to cover\nlarge areas and handle full mobility; however,\ncapacity is lower than with other layers. The\ntechnologies used in this layer can vary from\nDVB\/DAB to 3G Partnership Project (3GPP)\nUMTS to a system such as S-DMB (satellite digi-\ntal multimedia broadcasting) currently under\nstudy. The cellular layer includes 2G and 3G sys-\ntems and supports up to 2 Mb\/s depending on\nmobility conditions. This layer supports full\nmobility using handover techniques. The hot spot\nlayer supports very high data rates, but mobility\nis restricted. Personal area networks are meant\nfor offices and homes to communicate with dif-\nn Figure 2.

The fixed\nlayer contains optical fiber (e.g., fiber to the\nhome\/curb [FTTx]), twisted pair systems (e.g.,\nxDSL), and coaxial systems (e.g., CATV) as well\nas fixed wireless access systems (e.g., WiMax).\nThis is the Wireless World Research Forum\n(WWRF) vision of a future wireless world [4].\nBased on the above mentioned customer\nrequirements and technology trends, the expected\npeak data rate for systems beyond IMT-2000 is\ndefined as 100 Mb\/s for new mobile access and 1\nGb\/s for new nomadic\/local wireless access. This\ndata rate can only be achieved widely if the fre-\nquency resources are used efficiently. Therefore,\nresearch activities in terrestrial systems are mainly\nfocused on the radio network issues listed below.\nMore efficient air interface structures [4]:\n\u2022 Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing\n(OFDM)-based multicarrier code-division\nmultiple access (CDMA)\n\u2022 Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) sys-\ntems, smart antennas, and space-time coding\n\u2022 Adaptive modulation and coding, power con-\ntrol, equalization, and diversity\nMore efficient networking:\n\u2022 Dynamic channel allocation; admission, load,\nand congestion control\n\u2022 Adaptive handover strategies\n\u2022 Ad hoc networking\n\u2022 Cross-layer (IP) mechanisms\nMore efficient use of the radio spectrum:\n\u2022 Dynamic spectrum allocation\n\u2022 Software and cognitive radios\nMost of the above can also be employed to\nimprove efficiency of the satellite system, but\nthere are challenges in doing so while retaining\nflexibility with compatible standards to allow inte-\ngration between satellite and terrestrial systems.\nFrom Fig. 4 we note that there must be inter-\nworking (vertical connections) between the satel-\nlites at the top and the cellular, WLAN, PAN,\nand fixed systems lower down. There needs to be\nefficient coverage of hot spots as well as wider-\narea mobility coverage provided by the satellites.\nIn providing focused interworking, the challenge\nis not to block the ultimate goal of integration.\nWe now go on to review the evolution of\nsatellite systems to determine the constraints this\nimposes before returning to these challenges in\nmore detail.\nSATELLITE COMMUNICATION\nHISTORICAL EVOLUTION\nMOBILE SATELLITE SYSTEMS\nWe show in Fig. 5 some of the key landmarks and\nmajor mobile satellite systems (MSSs) that have\nresulted from them. It is interesting to note that\nINMARSAT came into existence at around the\nsame time as the first cellular operators providing\nfirst-generation analog services. In its initial peri-\nod, INMARSAT provided speech and low-data-\nrate services mainly to the maritime market of\nlarger ships in the L band using global beam cov-\nerage satellites. In 1990\u20131991, INMARSAT added\naeronautical services to passenger aircraft and\nsome land vehicles with the introduction of high-\ner-power spotbeam satellites. This was followed in\n1997\u20131998 with worldwide spotbeam operation in\nMSSs and the introduction of paging, navigation,\nand higher-rate digital to desktop-sized terminals.\nINMARSAT has concentrated on the use of geo-\nstationary (GEO) satellites, and in the mid-1990s\nseveral regional GEO systems emerged in compe-\ntition (e.g., OMNITRACS, EUTELTRACS,\nAMSC, and OPTUS), concentrating on land vehi-\ncles and using both L and Ku bands. These were\nonly moderately successful, while INMARSAT\nn Figure 3.

Of these, Iridium and Globalstar\ncame into service, but too late to compete with\nthe spread of terrestrial GSM, and on business\nrather than technological grounds went into\nChapter 11 bankruptcy by the early 2000s. The\nlesson learned was that constellations were too\nexpensive, at up to $10 billion to deploy, unless\nmarkets had large initial growth to provide rapid\npayback. Both systems are in existence today but\nwith fewer customers than initially predicted.\n(Orbcomm, a little LEO provider mainly to fixed\nterminals, suffered a similar fate). ICO, the pro-\nposed MEO system, got as far as launching one\nsatellite before also realizing that the business\ncase was not there.\nTo help the future development of the mobile\nsatellite industry, a European Task Force on\nAdvanced Satellite Mobile Systems (ASMS-TF)\nwas formed in 2001, and operates today in the\nfields of research and development, standards,\nand regulatory matters [5].\nIn the mid-1990s, larger so-called super GEO\nsatellites were proposed, with powers around 5\nkW and with 100\u2013200 spots rather than the earli-\ner generation of GEOs with 3\u20134 kW and 5\u201310\nspots. Several such systems were proposed, but\nthe one that successfully entered the market in\nthe early 2000s is THURAYA, based on the\nEuropean Telecommunications Standards Insti-\ntute (ETSI) GMR-1 standard, providing GSM\nand General Packet Radio Service (GPRS)-like\nservices covering Asia and parts of Europe.\nAlthough it is early days, these super GEO sys-\ntems seem to be successful, finding a niche with\ntravelers, trucks, and in areas where terrestrial\nmobile is expensive to deploy. Meanwhile,\nINMARSAT is providing its own super GEO,\nINMARSAT IV (first launched in the first quar-\nter of 2005) to take existing digital services from\n64 up to 432 kb\/; from the global area network\n(GAN) to the broadband GAN (BGAN).\nDespite the move by terrestrial mobile operators\nto CDMA, INMARSAT has continued to devel-\nop its proprietary time-division multiple access\n(TDMA) system but delivers 3G-equivalent\npacket-based services.\nSo the lessons learned from the mobile satel-\nlite experience are:\n\u2022 LEO and highly elliptical orbit (HEO) constel-\nlations have proved too expensive to compete\nwith GEOs or cellular systems, so there is now\na return to GEOs.\n\u2022 Satellites can only economically provide niche\nservices to areas inaccessible to cellular;\nhence, for mass market services there needs to\nbe integration, not to compete but to collabo-\nrate with cellular.\n\u2022 Select the service most appropriate to the\nsatellite delivery mechanism.\n\u2022 Use the wide coverage broadcast attribute of\nsatellites.\nBased on the above factors, the satellite digital\nmultimedia broadcasting (S-DMB) system was\nproposed within European Union (EU) projects\nSATIN [3], MoDiS [6], and MAESTRO [7] to\ndeliver multimedia broadcast and multicast ser-\nvices (MBMS) to users in terrestrial cellular cov-\nerage as well as outside. The proposed S-DMB\nsystem is mainly centered around content delivery\nor push type services where the content is pushed\ntoward the terminals whenever the resources are\navailable and stored in the terminal local cache\nmemory for later retrieval. The architecture is\ncharacterized by gap-fillers or intermediate mod-\nule repeaters (IMRs) located at selected 3G base\nstations, which broadcast the MBMS signals ter-\nrestrially in the adjacent MSS band to allow in-\nbuilding and urban area penetration.\nA similar concept has been adopted within\nthe MBSAT [8] system now in operation in\nJapan and Korea, where the service driver is\nmobile television rather than video content.\nSuch systems have competition from MBMS in\n3G and from DVB-H, but offer a real new mar-\nket opportunity for satellite and, most important,\nthe first truly integrated system delivery.\nThe DAB systems via satellite S-DAB (DARS\nin the United States) should also be mentioned in\nthis context as radio broadcast is a further exam-\nple of content delivery. The idea has been around\nsince 1990 when CD radio first filed in the United\nStates. Several systems have been proposed since\nthe S-DAB standards were produced with\nWORLDSPACE [9] in the mid-1990s being per-\nhaps the leading contender with its satellites cov-\nering Asia, the Caribbean, and the Americas.\nThe terrestrial equivalent, T-DAB, has not\nspread widely, with the limited U.K. network\nbeing perhaps the best developed. In the United\nStates, in the early 2000s two commercial sys-\ntems became operational: XM Radio using GEO\nsatellites, and SIRIUS satellite radio using\nHEOs. Both systems use terrestrial gap fillers in\na similar way to that proposed by SDMB and\nMBSAT. The use of HEO satellites is interesting\nin that they achieve improved coverage in the\nurban area due to their higher elevation angles\nand reduce the number of gap-fillers required.\nCurrently XM has around 3.5 million and SIR-\nIUS 1.5 million customers in the US.\nWhen we consider mobile broadband by satel-\nlite, the major market is for passenger vehicles\nn Figure 4.

The technology here has been\nmore akin to the very small aperture terminal\n(VSAT) model with local in-vehicle distribution.\nCBB has already installed terminals with a num-\nber of airlines. VSAT systems started in the off-\nshore oil business but have rapidly expanded to\ncruise liners and deep sea ferry operators using\nKu band, and provide commercial, engineering,\nand navigation services to passengers and crew.\nA number of satellite operators carry such ser-\nvices. Extensions can also be made to land vehi-\ncles, and EU Framework Programme 6 (FP6)\nprojects DRIVE\/OVERDRIVE [12] and FIFTH\n[13] have researched the train\/coach\/car markets.\nThe above broadband schemes still suffer\nfrom poor efficiency of use of satellite capacity,\nwhich makes them expensive. A solution to this\nmay be around the corner with the introduction\nof the new DVB-S2 standard in 2003 [14]. Prin-\ncipally aimed at fixed systems, it incorporates\nadaptive coding and modulation (ACM) schemes\nthat, when operated in connection with the\nreturn satellite channel (RCS), allow transmis-\nsion parameters to be optimized for each indi-\nvidual connection dependent on path conditions.\nA range of phase shift keying (PSK) and adap-\ntive PSK (APSK) modulation schemes and\nLDPC codes provide packet-by-packet optimiza-\ntion to meet adverse changing channel condi-\ntions. The new standard allows a range of data\ninputs including IP. Combining the DVB-S2\nACM scheme with multispot Ka band satellites\nand a DVB-RCS return link, current satellite\ncapacity can be increased by a factor of 10 or\nmore. The next step is to introduce mobility into\nthe standard, which will then enable it to be\nused for broadband mobile multimedia connec-\ntions as mentioned above.\nFIXED SATELLITE SYSTEMS\nFixed satellite systems continue to play an impor-\ntant role in the core network where, on a point-\nto-point basis, they can still compete with\nterrestrial links in some areas in which their cov-\nerage and reduced ground infrastructure are\nadvantages. Major international satellite opera-\ntors such as INTELSAT, SES GLOBAL, and\nEUTELSAT remain viable businesses. It is inter-\nesting to note that their business models have\nevolved; they have moved from IGO status to\nprivate companies. They have moved from sell-\ning bandwidth to selling service connections \u2014\nfrom megahertz to megabits per second \u2014 and\nnow have ground infrastructure as well as satel-\nlites among their assets. The industry has evolved\nvery conservatively, and the vast majority of\nsatellites are still of the transparent transponder\ntype operating in C, Ku, and Ka bands, but with\nincreasingly complex multibeams. The digital\npipe remains the major success using frequency-\ndivision multiple access (FDMA), with TDMA\nand satellite switched TDMA (SS-TDMA) intro-\nduced but not really catching on. Satellites have\nremained of the transparent type with the excep-\ntion of some digital TV broadcast satellites that\nhave embraced limited onboard switching. Full\nonboard processing has been considered too\nrisky due to lack of flexibility of the channel allo-\ncations and bit rates. On the other hand, traffic\nhas changed, with IP now a major percentage of\nthe whole via ISPs. Satellites have remained low\nto medium power, which has meant low efficien-\ncies of usage of the radio spectrum compared to\nterrestrial systems. As with mobile, we have seen\nfixed satellites develop separately from terrestri-\nal in both standards and operators with little if\nany integration of provision.\nThe success of DVB-S\/S2 standards in\nEurope has also led to two-way systems incorpo-\nrating VSATs at either Ku or Ka band return,\nthe RCS system. These have been found to be\nalternative ways of delivering IP services and\nincorporating mesh networks. However, the effi-\nciency of IP delivery still falls short of terrestrial\nwhere asymmetric DSL (ADSL) still rules\nsupreme in developed countries.\nVSAT networks in Europe have not really\ntaken off as expected and have not achieved the\nsize or volume of U.S. counterparts; cost and\nefficiency are the main reasons.\nThe final area of usage of fixed satellites has\nbeen in broadband access where coverage and\nspeed of implementation have been the niches.\nRural and suburban areas across Europe and\nparticularly in Eastern Europe have been regions\nwhere satellite terminals have been extensively\ndeployed so far. However, as ADSL is rolled out\nprogressively in the more developed countries,\nthe greater cost of the satellite cannot compete.\nThere is much talk of the digital divide (or is it a\npoverty gap?), and no doubt that vast areas of\nEurope will not be covered by cheaper terrestrial\nmeans. However, it will take political will to\nsolve this problem using satellites, as it is diffi-\ncult to see how pure economics will support\nsatellite delivery.\nSo the messages for future fixed satellite sys-\ntems are:\nn Figure 5.

Such satellites can be inter-\nconnected in orbit, and expand and reconfig-\nure as demand grows.\nSYSTEM ARCHITECTURE AND\nTECHNOLOGY ISSUES\nBased on business and market observation in the\nrecent past, the satellite community must defi-\nnitely look at the satellite as an integrated part\nof the global telecommunications infrastructure\nrather than as an individual entity. This phe-\nnomenon is going to be the basis for future\nsatellite system architectures; a possible generic\nsystem concept is depicted in Fig. 6.\nThis depicts an all-IP network with end-to-end\nconnections and guaranteed quality of service\n(QoS). There is complete integration between ter-\nrestrial fixed, cellular, and hot spot connections\nwith dynamic ad hoc routing between networks.\nThe interconnected satellite layer provides the\nwide-coverage larger cells and mobility manage-\nment between the various networks. A subsidiary\nlayer of intermediate-sized cells is provided by high\naltitude platforms (HAPs) located at around 20\u201325\nkm in the stratosphere to deal more efficiently with\nhot spot areas and relieve the demands on terres-\ntrial infrastructure as well as collection for lower-\npower sensor networks and broadcasting to urban\nareas. All networks are vertically and horizontally\nconnected, as indicated in Fig 4, and seamless and\nsecure handover between them is provided. This is\na vision, and in the following we look at the com-\nponents that will be needed to realize the vision.\nSATELLITE CONSTELLATIONS AND PAYLOADS\nIn the immediate future, the choice may be\nbetween GEO and HEO since in urban areas the\nprobability of direct reception from a HEO satel-\nlite is higher than from GEO satellites; hence,\nthere is reduced blockage, and fewer terrestrial\nrepeaters are required [15]. However, LEO\/\nMEO will come onto the scene in the longer\nterm due to availability of sophisticated small\n(hundreds of kilograms) satellites with cheaper\nprices for production and launching. Clusters and\nswarms of such satellites, maybe with fragmented\nfunctions and connected together via an in-space\nad hoc network, will be possible.\nHAPs, although not strictly satellite, can also\nplay a role in both mobile and fixed satellite ser-\nvice delivery. For the emerging sensor network\/\nsecurity systems, they could be more efficient\nstandalone than satellite for lower-power termi-\nnals or sensors. They could also play a role in a\nhybrid network of satellites and HAPs where\nthere is much to be gained from use of hybrid\norbits with interorbit links in terms of connectiv-\nity, coverage, and service routing.\nWhen we consider future payloads there are\ntwo main choices, bent pipe (transparent) and\nn Figure 6.

However, regenerative payloads offer\na number of benefits, such as efficient spectrum\nsharing, reduced delay, improved link budgets,\nand possible seamless integration with terrestrial\nnetworks. But so far they have not been suffi-\nciently flexible, as it is difficult to design pay-\nloads taking into account different transmission\nformats. However, research on software radio\ncan be applied to this problem to solve the flexi-\nbility issue in the future [16].\nRADIO INTERFACE AND NETWORKING ISSUES\nMuch greater emphasis has to be put onto the\nefficiency of the physical layer by use of fade\nmitigation techniques (FMT) [17], particularly\nACM schemes [18], which are easier to imple-\nment in the fixed than in the mobile environ-\nment. The use of FMT at the higher frequency\nbands will be implemented and become a part of\nthe radio resource management (RRM)\/ medi-\num access control (MAC \u2014 part of layer 2)\nschemes [19]. More efficient MAC will incorpo-\nrate RRM in a packet-based environment with\nadaptation of user traffic. Distributed RRM, in\nthe same way as in mobile systems, is a key\nresearch area, and mobility management is no\nlonger limited to a single-layer approach. There\nwill be a need to look at cross-layer protocol\nschemes, where signaling information will be\nexchanged even between nonadjacent open sys-\ntems interconnection (OSI) layers, in order to\nimprove the efficiency of delivery within the IP\nnetwork. RRM optimization with cross-layer\ninformation can address several aspects:\n\u2022 In the physical layer, radio channel conditions\nwill be estimated to select one from a set of\npossible transmission modes with related\nresource requests at layer 2 to improve RRM\nand MM.\n\u2022 In the link layer, network-specific MAC tech-\nniques can be utilized by the IP layer to\nimprove handover performance.\n\u2022 In the network layer, a packet-switched system\nemploying IP should be adopted by the satel-\nlite system in order to be integrated with ter-\nrestrial next-generation networks. IP-layer\nQoS and mobility provision (i.e., integrated or\ndifferentiated services) should be adequately\nmapped to RRM protocols.\n\u2022 In the transport layer, an interesting example is\nto perform dynamic bandwidth allocation where\nresources are requested in advance depending\non the expected behavior of the TCP conges-\ntion window. Multihoming and reliable trans-\nport layer mobility can be supported with\ndynamic IP address reconfiguration. Another\npossibility is offered by joint transport\/physical\nlayer forward error correction coding design for\nimproved QoS without retransmissions.\n\u2022 In the application layer, different (real-time or\nnon-real-time) traffic types should have distinct\nQoS characterization, thus entailing different\npriorities to be adopted at layer 2. Also, appli-\ncation layer mobility mechanisms such as Ses-\nsion Initiation Protocol (SIP) can interact with\nIP mobility management to improve handover.\nBesides the above considerations, issues relat-\ned to mobile satellite air interface compliance\nwith the terrestrial mobile air interface and the\nthrust by the terrestrial mobile community\ntoward OFDM-based air interfaces have also\nspurred interest in OFDM-based satellite air\ninterfaces. Therefore, special satellite features\n(e.g., payload nonlinearity distortion) that affect\nOFDM performance have to be investigated\nthoroughly. The research so far has shown that\nthe OFDM scheme with efficient predistortion\ntechniques and powerful codes can provide\nmuch better performance over satellite links\nthan wideband CDMA (W-CDMA) [18].\nWe are likely to see some moves toward inte-\ngration as satellite and terrestrial operators\nmerge and start to consider more integrated pro-\nvision. In this respect, interworking issues and\nstandards are likely to be very important.\nSPECTRUM\nCurrently existing mobile satellite systems\n(INMARSAT, THURAYA, MBSAT, etc.) oper-\nate in the L and S bands. In general, the lower\nmicrowave bands are easier and more efficient for\nmobile applications as no tracking is required and\nterminal equipment can be made cheaper. In addi-\ntion, if integration is to be pursued, satellite bands\nshould ideally be adjacent to those allocated for\nterrestrial mobile to again ensure affordable termi-\nnals. Thus, the demands will be for more spectrum\nin the 3\u20136 GHz regions for both services. The Ku\nband, primarily allocated for fixed services, is being\nused on a noninterference basis for some mobile\napplications (e.g., CBB). For passenger vehicles\nthe greater expense of the tracking antenna\nrequired can be acceptable but is problematic for\npersonal use. Allocations at the Ka band and\nabove for mobile, apart from the passenger vehicle\nniche, are further limited by equipment costs.\nFor fixed satellite systems the Ku band is the\ncurrent workhorse for all operators (INTELSAT,\nEUTELSAT, PANAMSAT, SES-GLOBAL, etc.)\nwith Ka band gradually being introduced for uni-\ncast services. In some cases combinations of the\nbands are used, for example, in smaller customer\nterminal equipment with higher-capacity outbound\nlinks at the Ku band and lower capacity at the Ka\nband on return. This is dictated by interference\nissues as well as equipment costs. As multimedia\nservice demands increase, there will be a move to\nQ\/V bands at 40\/50 GHz, but here equipment is\nstill expensive and FMT will almost certainly be\nrequired to combat the increased propagation\nlosses. However, there are upsides in moving to\nthe smaller wavelengths where smaller physical\nsizes of antennas benefit the spacecraft real estate\nRegenerative \npayloads offer a\nnumber of benefits,\nsuch as efficient\nspectrum sharing,\nreduced delay,\nimproved link \nbudgets, and\npossible seamless\nintegration with\nterrestrial networks.\nBut so far they have\nnot been sufficiently\nflexible.\nEVANS LAYOUT  10\/6\/05  12:44 PM  Page 79\n         \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

The latter is key to\nimproving satellite payload efficiencies. An addi-\ntional advantage is that these bands are much\ncloser to those allocated for HAPs and hence\nwould aid the integration of the two systems.\nLooking further ahead, research into the use\nof optical frequencies for earth-to-space paths is\nalready underway, but perhaps these frequencies\nwill be better employed outside of Earth\u2019s atmo-\nsphere for intersatellite and satellite-HAPs con-\nnections.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this article we have examined the impact of\nsatellites in the future global communication sys-\ntem. Satellite systems would need to make major\nleaps in efficiency in order to compete with ter-\nrestrial networks in developed environments,\nand it is not clear they can do so. We have hope-\nfully demonstrated that the future of satellite is\nvery much in an integrated architecture with ter-\nrestrial systems to provide multimedia services,\nbe they mobile or fixed systems. Of course there\nwill still be a role for satellites in niche areas in\nair or at sea, and to address new areas of disas-\nter relief and security (e.g., sensor networks).\nAlthough we see a future for hybrid orbits and\neven HAPs, this can only be in a fully integrated\nsystem architecture together with terrestrial; the\nfuture is definitely integrated.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis work was carried out as part of an EU\nfunded network of excellence, SatNEx [20], and\nthe authors would like to thank all 22 members\nof the SatNEx consortium for their contributions\nto this article.
