In the hard state most of energy is radiated\nabove \u223c 10 keV. The spectrum is dominated by a power\nlaw with the photon spectral index \u0393 < 2.0 and a high-\nenergy cutoff above 100 keV (Grove et al. 1998). A common\ninterpretation of this emission is in terms of Comptoniza-\ntion of soft seed photons by thermal, hot, optically-thin elec-\ntron plasma. Cyg X-1 (Gierlin\u00b4ski et al. 1997) and GX339\u20134\n(Zdziarski et al. 1998) are typical examples of the hard state\nBHB. In the soft state most of the energy is radiated in the\nsoft X-rays, below \u223c 10 keV. This energy range is dominated\nby a blackbody-like component with characteristic temper-\nature \u223c 1 keV. This component is usually attributed to the\nthermal emission of a cold, optically-thick accretion disc,\nextending down to the marginally stable orbit (Shakura &\nSunyaev 1973). The disc spectrum is often accompanied by a\nhigh-energy tail, which can be described as a power law with\na typical photon spectral index \u0393 \u223c 2.0\u20132.5, extending into\n\u03b3-rays without apparent break or cutoff (Grove et al. 1998).\nLMC X-1 (Schlegel et al. 1994), LMC X-3 (Ebisawa et al.\n1993), GS 1124\u201368 just after the outburst (Ebisawa et al.\n1994) or Cyg X-1 between May and August 1996 (Gierlin\u00b4ski\net al. 1999) are the examples of the soft state BHB.\nAt first approximation the soft component in the soft\nstate can be described by a multicolour disc model (here-\nafter MCD; Mitsuda et al. 1984), which spectrum is a\nsum of blackbodies with radial temperature distribution\nT (r) \u221d r\u22123\/4. This model has been commonly used for\nspectral fitting by many authors. Though MCD model ap-\nproximates the disc spectral shape well, it ignores the in-\nner torque-free boundary condition and parameters derived\nthrough it are incorrect. An improvement of the MCD model\nis a multicolour disc model in the pseudo-Newtonian poten-\ntial (Gierlin\u00b4ski et al. 1999), taking properly into account the\nboundary condition.\nIn vicinity of the black hole relativistic effects become\nimportant.

Ebisawa\nspectrum have been studied by Cunningham (1975), Laor,\nNetzer & Piran (1990), Asaoka (1989), Hanawa (1989), Fu\n& Taam (1990), Yamada et al. (1994) and others. Hanawa\n(1989) calculated disc spectra around a non-rotating black\nhole, creating a fast-computing model that have been used\nfor spectral fitting several times (e.g. Ebisawa, Mitsuda &\nHanawa 1991; Makishima et al. 2000). However, this model\nis limited to Schwarzschild metric only and effects of light\nbending have been neglected. More advanced model was de-\nveloped by Laor et al. (1990), who studied accretion discs\naround rotating black hole, taking into account both rel-\nativistic effects affecting radiation and vertical structure of\nthe disc. Laor (1990) applied this model to the AGN spectra.\nIn this paper we show an application of the general rel-\nativistic (hereafter GR) disc model to the soft state X-ray\nspectra of BHB. We focus on estimating the black hole spin.\nThe model thoroughly treats relativistic effects in the deep\ngravitational potential of the black hole. In Section 2 we give\ndescription of the model and show examples of the model\nspectra. Then, we fit the X-ray spectral data of LMC X-1\n(Section 3.1) and GRO J1655\u201340 (Section 3.2) with the GR\nmodel. In Section 4 we discuss the obtained results.\n2 MODEL DESCRIPTION\nWe consider an accretion disc around a black hole (e.g. Page\n& Thorne 1974). The model is based upon certain assump-\ntions. We assume that the disc rotates in the equatorial\nplane around the Kerr black hole; that it is in a steady\nstate; that it is axially symmetric; that it is flat and geomet-\nrically thin; that it is optically thick; that it locally radiates\naway the dissipated gravitational energy as a blackbody;\nthat there is no emission below the marginally stable orbit.\nA black hole is characterized by its mass, M , and angu-\nlar momentum, J . We use dimensionless spin a \u2261 Jc\/GM2,\nwhere 0 \u2264 a \u2264 1 and a = 0 corresponds to the non-rotating\n(Schwarzschild) black hole. In accreting systems the radi-\nation emitted by the disc produces a counteracting torque\nand the black hole cannot be spun-up beyond a = 0.998\n(Thorne 1974). Therefore we do not exceed this value in our\nmodel and refer to it as to the maximally rotating black\nhole. The efficiency of accretion, \u03b7, varies from \u03b7 \u2248 0.057 for\nthe non-rotating black hole to \u03b7 \u2248 0.32 for a = 0.998.\nThe spectrum of the disc, F\u03bd , seen at infinity is com-\nputed by means of a photon transfer function, T , which\ndescribes travel of photons from the point of origin to the\ndistant observer. The photon of frequency \u03bde is emitted at\nradius re, at cosine angle \u00b5e \u2261 cos \u03b8e and then perceived at\nfrequency \u03bdo by the observer at cosine angle \u00b5o \u2261 cos i. The\nobserved flux is\nF\u03bdo(\u00b5o) =\n(\nRg\nD\n)2\n\u03bdo\n\u222b\ndgeff\n\u222b\ndre\n\u222b\nd\u00b5e\n\u00d7 r T (a, re, \u00b5e, geff , \u00b5o)N(re, \u00b5e, \u03bdo\ngeff\n). (1)\nSubscript \u2018e\u2019 denotes quantities measured in the local frame\nco-moving with the disc and subscript \u2018o\u2019 denotes quanti-\nties measured by the observer at infinity. N(re, \u00b5e,\n\u03bdo\ngeff\n) \u2261\nN\u03bde(re, \u00b5e) is the specific photon number intensity of the\ndisc emission, geff \u2261 \u03bdo\/\u03bde is the effective redshift of the\nphoton, D is the distance to the source and Rg \u2261 GM\/c2 is\nthe gravitational radius. Numerical constants are included\nin the transfer function.\nThe transfer function treats the special and general\nrelativistic effects affecting the spectrum. It takes into ac-\ncount the Doppler energy shift from the fast moving mat-\nter in the disc, the gravitational shift and the light bend-\ning near the massive object. It includes integration over the\nazimuthal angle \u03c6e. Each element of the transfer function,\nT (a, re, \u00b5e, geff , \u00b5o), was computed by summing all photon\ntrajectories for all angles \u03c6e, at given (re, \u00b5e), for which re-\nquired (geff , \u00b5o) were obtained. The details of the transfer\nfunction computation are given in Appendix A. A similar\napproach to computing the black hole disc spectra has been\napplied, e.g., by Laor et al. (1990) and Asaoka (1989). Note\nthat our construction of T is slightly different than that of\nCunningham (1975), as the latter one involves the relation\nof the specific intensities at the emitter and the observer,\nrespectively, given by Liouville\u2019s theorem, while our model\nis based on counting individual photons.\nThe local gravitational energy release per unit area of\nthe disc, per unit time is (Page & Thorne 1974)\nQ(x) =\n3M\u02d9dc\n6\n8piG2M2\n1\nx4(x3 \u2212 3x+ 2a)\n[\nx\u2212 x0 \u2212 3\n2\na ln\n(\nx\nx0\n)\n\u2212 3(x1 \u2212 a)\n2\nx1(x1 \u2212 x2)(x1 \u2212 x3) ln\n(\nx\u2212 x1\nx0 \u2212 x1\n)\n\u2212 3(x2 \u2212 a)\n2\nx2(x2 \u2212 x1)(x2 \u2212 x3) ln\n(\nx\u2212 x2\nx0 \u2212 x2\n)\n\u2212 3(x3 \u2212 a)\n2\nx3(x3 \u2212 x1)(x3 \u2212 x2) ln\n(\nx\u2212 x3\nx0 \u2212 x3\n)]\n, (2)\nwhere x = r\n1\/2\ne , x0 = r\n1\/2\nms , x1 = 2 cos(\n1\n3\narccos a \u2212 pi\/3),\nx2 = 2 cos(\n1\n3\narccos a+ pi\/3) and x3 = \u22122 cos( 13 arccos a).\nrms = 3 + A2 \u2212 sign a [(3\u2212 A1)(3 +A1 + 2A2)]1\/2 (3)\nis the marginally stable orbit radius, where A1 = 1 + (1 \u2212\na2)1\/3[(1+ a)1\/3+(1\u2212 a)1\/3] and A2 = (3a2+A21)1\/2. Both\nre and rms are expressed in units of Rg.\nThe photon number intensity, N\u03bde , can be derived\nfrom the energy release rate, Q. However, the relation\nbetween these two quantities is not simply Q(re) =\u222b\nh\u03bdeN\u03bde(re, \u00b5e)d\u03bded\u00b5e, as assumed in previous similar cal-\nculations (e.g., Laor et al. 1990). The photon number in-\ntensity which is used in equation (1), is defined in terms of\nthe distant observer coordinate frame. On the other hand,\nQ is defined as the energy dissipated per unit proper time\nper unit proper area, as measured by the observer orbiting\nwith the disc. The corresponding dissipation rate measured\nby the distant observer will be affected by kinematic and\ngravitational time dilation and length contraction. We em-\nphasize that these effects are not included in the calculation\nof the single photon trajectory, and are treated separately\nwhen applying the transfer function formalism.\nIn Appendix B we derive transformation of the time\nand the disc surface area between the disc rest frame and\nthe frame of the distant observer:\ndt\u2032 = \u03b2tdt, dr\n\u2032d\u03c6\u2032 = \u03b2Sdrd\u03c6, (4)\nwhere (t, r, \u03c6) and (t\u2032, r\u2032, \u03c6\u2032) are the coordinates of the refer-\nence frame of the distant observer and the disc, respectively.\nIn order to find a locally emitted spectrum we would\nc\u00a9 2001 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201313\nRelativistic accretion disc 3\nneed to compute the vertical structure of the disc. However,\nthis problem did not find a satisfactory general solution yet.\nInstead, we simply assume that each point of the disc radi-\nates like a blackbody and introduce two corrections. First,\nwe note that the Thomson scattering dominates over ab-\nsorption in the inner part of the disc and the local spectrum\nis affected by Comptonization. At a given radius, re, we ap-\nproximate the spectrum by a diluted blackbody,\nBdb\u03bde =\n1\nf4\ncol\nB\u03bde(fcolTeff), (5)\nwhere B\u03bde is the Planck function, fcol = Tcol\/Teff is the spec-\ntral hardening factor, Tcol is locally observed colour temper-\nature and Teff is the effective temperature, related to the lo-\ncally dissipated energy, Q, as \u03c3T 4eff = Q. Following Shimura\n& Takahara (1995) we use fcol = 1.7.\nThe second correction concerns angular distribution of\nlocal emission. We assume a linear limb darkening in form:\nI\u03bde(\u00b5e) = I0\n1 + \u03b4\u00b5e\n1 + \u03b4\nBdb\u03bde , (6)\nwhere \u03b4 = 2.06 in classical electron scattering limit (e.g.\nPhillip & Me\u00b4sza\u00b4ros 1986). I\u03bde is the specific intensity in\nthe local frame, co-rotating with the disc. Factor I0 is\nfound from the requirement of energy conservation. Namely,\nthe power emitted by a limb-darkened surface element dA,\n2pi\n\u222b 1\n0\nI\u03bde(\u00b5e)\u00b5ed\u00b5edA, should be equal to the power emit-\nted by the same surface element without limb darkening,\npiBdb\u03bde dA. From this we find\nI0 = 3\n1 + \u03b4\n3 + 2\u03b4\n, (7)\nand\nI\u03bde(\u00b5e) = 3\n1 + \u03b4\u00b5e\n3 + 2\u03b4\nBdb\u03bde . (8)\nThen, the specific photon number intensity of the disc,\nmeasured by the distant observer, is given by\nN\u03bde(\u00b5e) = \u03b2S\u03b2t\nI\u03bde(\u00b5e)\nh\u03bde\n. (9)\nThere is, however, one effect that we have not taken into\naccount. Due to gravitational focusing some of the emitted\nphotons return to the disc, where they are reprocessed or\nscattered. Since the returning photons alter the locally emit-\nted spectrum recurrently, taking them into account would\nrequire enormous computing time and would make spectral\nfitting practically impossible. In our model returning pho-\ntons are lost, so the disc luminosity and temperature are\nunderestimated for the spin close to maximum. This effect\nwas studied by Cunningham (1976). He found that return-\ning radiation is negligible for a < 0.9. The difference between\nthe actual locally generated flux and that in the absence of\nreturning radiation is only a few per cent over most of the\ninner disc for the maximally rotating black hole. At lower\nspins, the effect is much less pronounced. In this paper we\ncompute the GR disc spectra for a = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and\n0.998. Though the a = 0.998 model underestimates temper-\nature and luminosity, the interpolation between the models\nwould give accurate results for a < 0.9, and slightly overes-\ntimated spin measurement otherwise.\nFigure 1 shows the GR disc spectra for different val-\nues of the black hole spin. We clearly see how the accretion\nFigure 1. Spectra from the GR disc model for a = 0, 0.25, 0.5,\n0.75 and 0.998 (from the bottom to the top).

The effect of the limb\ndarkening in the relativistic disc is also shown.\nc\u00a9 2001 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201313\n4 M. Gierlin\u00b4ski, A. Macio lek-Niedz\u00b4wiecki and K. Ebisawa\nefficiency grows with increasing spin, when energy is dissi-\npated deeper in the gravitational potential. On Figure 2 we\ncompare spectra of the GR model (with a = 0) and the\npseudo-Newtonian (PN) model (Gierlin\u00b4ski et al. 1999). The\nPN model approximates temperature distribution with good\naccuracy, but effects of Doppler and gravitational shifts,\nlight bending and focusing are neglected and light propa-\ngates through flat space. With increasing inclination angle\nboth energy of the peak and normalization of the relativistic\ndisc spectrum (dashed curve) increase in compare to the PN\ndisc spectrum (dotted curve), mostly due to Doppler shifts\nand increase of the apparent disc area. A similar effect was\nfound by Fu & Taam (1990). On the same figure we also show\nthe effect of the limb darkening (solid curve), enhancing the\nspectrum for lower and diminishing it for higher inclination\nangles. Next, we check how the parameters obtained with the\nPN model relate to these from the GR model. To do this,\nwe created fake ASCA spectra using the GR model with the\nfollowing parameters: M = 10M\u2299, a = 0, M\u02d9d = 10\n18 g s\u22121,\nD = 1 kpc, rin = 6, rout = 10\n4, fcol = 1.7. The spectra were\ncomputed for \u03b4 = 0 and 2.06, for several inclination angles.\nThen, we fitted the PN disc model to the spectra finding\nthe black hole mass and the accretion rate. The results are\npresented on Figure 3. If the limb darkening is taken into ac-\ncount in the generated data, the accretion rate obtained with\nthe PN model is underestimated by factor \u223c 0.8, almost in-\ndependently of the inclination angle. The mass estimation is\nexact at inclination i \u2248 45\u25e6, underestimated for higher and\noverestimated for lower inclination angles. We stress that\nthese fits were performed for a non-rotating black hole only.\nZhang, Cui and Chen (1997a) investigated accretion\nonto a rotating black hole in an approximate way. They used\nthe MCD model and applied GR corrections due to frac-\ntional change in the colour temperature and due to change\nin the integrated flux. As a result, they were able to con-\nstrain the black hole spin of a few BHB, including GRO\nJ1655\u201340, which we will analyze in details in Section 3.2.\nFor comparison, we have applied their method to the spec-\ntra created by our GR model. The result depends on the\nGR corrections applied. Since Zhang et al. (1997) tabulated\nthese corrections for a = 0 and 0.998 only, the discrepancies\nare largest for a \u223c 0.5. In particular, for spectra generated\nby the GR model with a = 0.998, 0.75 and 0.5, the approxi-\nmate treatment yields a = 0.95, 0.58 and 0.24, respectively.\nWe however note, that with GR corrections calculated pre-\ncisely for all spin and inclination angle values the approxi-\nmate method can provide with reasonably accurate results.\nThe relativistic disc model parameters are: the black\nhole mass, M , and its spin, a, the inner and outer disc radii,\nrin and rout, respectively (in units of Rg), the accretion rate,\nM\u02d9d and the inclination angle, i. Subscript \u2018d\u2019 denotes the\naccretion rate in the disc only, excluding all possible energy\ndissipation outside the disc. In our fits we always keep rout =\n104, so the model has at most 5 free parameters.\nWe underline that the overall model spectral shape does\nnot change significantly, when these parameters vary. At first\napproximation, there are only two quantities fixing the spec-\ntrum: the energy of the peak in the spectrum (or the tem-\nperature) and the total flux (normalization). They translate\ninto five model parameters, therefore only two out of them\ncan be established uniquely. In most of our fits we fix i, a\nand rin, leaving M and M\u02d9d as free parameters. As we show\nFigure 3. Fits of the pseudo-Newtonian disc model to the fake\nspectra generated from the GR model. The data were created\nfor a non-rotating 10M\u2299 black hole with M\u02d9d = 10\n18 g s\u22121 with\n(filled squares) and without (empty squares) limb darkening.\nlater, the inner disc radius as a free parameter can be also\nconstrained to some extent.\nHowever, the model, though unable to establish all pa-\nrameters simultaneously, yields tight correlations between\nthem. In particular, for a given spectrum and rin = rms, as\na increases, M\u02d9d decreases (to compensate the increased ac-\ncretion efficiency) but M increases (to keep the absolute in-\nner disc radius Rin \u221d rinM when rin decreases). For a given\nspectrum and a fixed, as rin increases, M\u02d9d increases but M\ndecreases. Having any additional restrictions for black hole\nmass and inclination angle we can hope to estimate the black\nhole spin.\n3 APPLICATION TO THE DATA\nFor spectral fits, we use xspec v10 (Arnaud 1996). The con-\nfidence range of each model parameter is given for a 90 per\ncent confidence interval, i.e., \u2206\u03c72 = 2.7 (e.g. Press et al.\n1992).\nThe X-ray spectra of both sources can be decomposed\ninto two components: a soft, thermal emission peaking\naround a few keV and a high-energy tail. We interpret them\nin terms of an optically thick cold accretion disc and opti-\ncally thin hot plasma. Therefore we fit the data by a model\nconsisting of the GR disc and a high-energy tail, which we\nmodel either by a power law or by thermal Comptonization\n(see below). The model spectra are absorbed by the inter-\nstellar medium with a column density NH, for which we use\nthe opacities of Ba lucin\u00b4ska-Church & McCammon (1992)\nand the abundances of Anders & Grevesse (1989).\nWhile constructing the disc model, we have tabulated\nthe transfer function, T , for five values of the black hole\nspin: a = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 0.998. Since the radius of\nthe marginally stable orbit, which is the lower limit of rin,\nc\u00a9 2001 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201313\nRelativistic accretion disc 5\nis a function of a, we cannot interpolate between transfer\nfunctions tabulated for different values of a, when rin is close\nto rms. Therefore, we fit the data only for these five fixed\nvalues of a. In all the fits we keep the spectral hardening\nfactor, fcol = 1.7 and the limb darkening factor \u03b4 = 2.06.\n3.1 LMC X-1\n3.1.1 Source properties\nLMC X-1 is a luminous X-ray source in the Large Magellanic\nCloud. It had been a long-standing controversy about the\noptical counterpart of the X-ray source, since the position\nof LMC X-1 established by Einstein was between two stars\nseparated by only 6\u201d. Cowley et al. (1995) improved the\nposition of LMC X-1 from ROSAT -HRI observations and\nconfirmed that the optical counterpart is a peculiar O7 III\nStar #32 with visual magnitude V \u223c 14.8. Using optical\nspectroscopy Hutchings et al. (1987) showed that Star #32\nis in a binary system with orbital period of 4.2288 days.\nThey found the mass function, fM = 0.14 \u00b1 0.05M\u2299,\nand the lower limit for the mass of the compact object,\nM > 4M\u2299, which makes LMC X-1 a good candidate for the\nstellar-mass black hole. The inclination angle of the binary\nis constrained by the lack of X-ray eclipses to be i < 63\u25e6.5.\nThe mass ratio, q \u2261M\u2217\/M is greater than 2, which, together\nwith the mass function yields\nM sin3 i > 0.8M\u2299. (10)\nThe upper limit for the companion star is 25M\u2299, therefore\nM < 12.5M\u2299 and i > 24\n\u25e6.\nThe distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is\nuncertain. It is usually published in terms of the distance\nmodulus,m\u2212M = 5 logDpc\u22125, wherem andM are appar-\nent and absolute visual magnitudes and Dpc is the distance\nexpressed in parsecs. Different determinations of the dis-\ntance modulus result in conflicting results, from 18.065\u00b10.12\n(Stanek, Zaritsky & Harris 1998) to 18.7 \u00b1 0.1 (Feast &\nCatchpole 1997). This corresponds to the span in distance\nfrom 38.8 kpc to 57.5 kpc. Since the compact object mass\ndetermined from the disc observations depends linearly on\nD, this will significantly increase the uncertainty of mass\ndetermination.\nThe X-ray spectrum of LMC X-1 resembles the soft\nstate spectrum of Cyg X-1 (Gierlin\u00b4ski et al. 1999). At first\napproximation it can be represented by a blackbody with\ntemperature \u223c 0.7 keV and a high-energy power-law tail\nbeyond the blackbody (e.g. Ebisawa, Mitsuda & Inoue 1989;\nSchlegel et al. 1994; Treves at al. 2000; Schmidtke, Ponder &\nCowley 1999; Nowak et al. 2001). No transition to the hard\nstate has been ever observed.\n3.1.2 Spectral fits\nLMC X-1 was observed by ASCA on April 2\u20133, 1995. We\nhave extracted the SIS spectrum with the net exposure time\nof 23.6 ks. In our fits we use the 0.7\u201310 keV spectrum, ex-\ncept the channels between 1.8\u20132.2 keV, which are strongly\naffected by the instrumental gold feature. Since we are in-\nterested in the shape of the disc continuum, this small gap\nin energy channels will not affect our results.\nBoth the distance to LMC X-1, D, and the inclination\nFigure 4. The ASCA\/SIS observation of LMC X-1 and a model\nwith a non-rotating black hole (upper panel; see Table 1). The\nmodel (solid curve) is decomposed into the GR disc (dotted curve)\nand thermal Comptonization (dashed curve). The lower panel\nshows the data\u2013model residuals divided by errors.\nangle of the system, i, are uncertain. In most of our fits we\nuse D = 50 kpc and i = 50\u25e6, but we also check our results\nwithin the acceptable range of 38.8 kpc < D < 57.5 kpc\nand 24\u25e6 < i < 63\u25e6.5. We do not impose any constraints on\nthe black hole mass, M , during the fits, but check its consis-\ntency with the limits obtained from the optical observations,\n4.0M\u2299 \u2264M \u2264 12.5M\u2299, a posteriori.\nFor the high-energy tail beyond the disc spectrum we\nchose a thermal Comptonization model (Zdziarski, Johnson\n& Magdziarz 1996). This model is fast and has few param-\neters, which makes it easy to use. We would like to stress\nthat one important difference between the Comptonization\nmodel and a power law is the low-energy cutoff. The cut-\noff should be present in the Comptonized spectrum around\nthe maximum disc temperature if the seed photons come\nfrom the disc. The soft power law, extending down towards\nlower energies without cutoff, may significantly affect mea-\nsurements of the disc parameters.\nThe Comptonization model has the following parame-\nters: the electron temperature, kTe, the asymptotic power-\nlaw photon spectral index, \u0393, and the seed photons tem-\nperature, kTs. We have found that the electron temperature\nhas a negligible effect on the fit results, so we keep it at 50\nkeV during our fits. We note, that due to lack of the data\nabove 10 keV we cannot constrain plasma parameters, and\nwe treat the Comptonization model only as a phenomeno-\nlogical component supplementary to the disc model. It is\nnot our intention to study the hot plasma properties in this\npaper.\nWe fit the data by a model consisting of the GR disc,\nComptonization and interstellar absorption. First, we as-\nsume that the disc extends down to the marginally stable\norbit, rin = rms. The fit results are presented in Table 1.\nWe notice that goodness of the fit does not change with the\nc\u00a9 2001 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201313\n6 M. Gierlin\u00b4ski, A.

However, the best fitting mass varies be-\ntween \u223c 10M\u2299 for the non-rotating black hole to \u223c 40M\u2299\nfor the maximally rotating black hole. As we see, only the\nfits with a <\u223c 0.5 are consistent with the upper mass limit,\nM < 12.5M\u2299 (Section 3.1).\nIn order to better estimate the black hole spin we fit\nthe data in a wide range of inclination angles and compute\n90 per cent confidence contours for inclination-mass rela-\ntion. The results are presented on Figure 5. We find the\nfits with a = 0, 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75 consistent with limits on\nthe mass and the inclination angle (shaded area), and only\na = 0.998 contour lies outside the acceptable area. Even if\nwe take into account the significant uncertainty in the LMC\nX-1 distance estimation, this contour is still outside the lim-\nits. Thus, though we cannot precisely find the upper limit\nfor the black hole spin, we conclude that the spin close to\nmaximal is ruled-out. We stress, however, that this holds\nonly when the disc extends down to the marginally stable\norbit.\nIf we allow for free rin > rms we cannot limit the black\nhole spin. In case of a non-rotating black hole the spectral fits\ndo not constrain the inner disc radius. The best-fitting value\nis rin \u2248 100, but with the fit improvement by \u2206\u03c72 = 1.9 only\nin compare to the disc extending down to rms. This value of\nrin, however, would require a very small mass of the compact\nobject, M \u2248 1.5M\u2299 and a super-Eddington accretion rate,\nM\u02d9d \u2248 80LEddc\u22122. From the lower mass limit, M > 4M\u2299,\nwe find the upper limit on the inner disc radius, rin <\u223c 30.\nSince at this radius the black hole spin is not relevant, this\nlimit holds for any spin, and we find no constraints on a this\ntime.\nWithin the acceptable range of M , a, D and i the best-\nfitting relative accretion rate in the disc, m\u02d9d \u2261 M\u02d9dc2\/LEdd,\nlies between \u223c 1 and \u223c 5. In terms of the radiated power it\ncorresponds to a fraction \u03b7m\u02d9d \u223c 0.06\u20130.3 of the Eddington\nluminosity, where \u03b7 is the accretion efficiency at a given spin.\nThe total accretion rate, including the hard tail luminosity,\nis \u03b7m\u02d9 \u223c 0.1\u20130.5. The unabsorbed bolometric luminosity of\nLMC X-1, inferred from the model, is (2.5\u20133.7)\u00d71038 erg\ns\u22121 (3.2\u00d7 1038 erg s\u22121 at D = 50 kpc), from which \u223c 0.6 is\nin the disc and the rest in the tail.\nThe parameters of the Comptonizing tail are worth a\nword of comment. As it can be seen from Table 1, a pho-\nton spectral index we found, \u0393 \u223c 3.3\u20133.5, appears to be\nsignificantly softer, than typical values of 2.1\u20132.4 reported\nby Ebisawa et al. (1989) and Schlegel et al. (1994). How-\never, the discrepancy emerges from the different model ap-\nplied. When we fit our ASCA data with the simple model\nof the MCD and a power law, we find \u0393 = 2.26+0.13\n\u22120.16 and\nkTin = 0.807 \u00b1 0.007 keV, which confirms that LMC X-1\nwas in the same spectral state during all these observations.\nA different result of softer spectrum was reported by Nowak\net al. (2001), who fitted the 1996 December 6\u20138 RXTE ob-\nservation with the multicolour disc + power law model and\nfound \u0393 \u2248 2.9\u20133.1 and kTin \u2248 0.9 keV.\n3.2 GRO J1655\u201340\n3.2.1 Source properties\nThe X-ray transient GRO J1655\u201340 was discovered by\nBATSE detector on board CGRO on July 27, 1994 (Zhang\net al. 1994). The optical counterpart was soon discovered\nby Bailyn et al. (1995a). The inclination of the binary sys-\ntem is in the range 63\u25e6.7 to 70\u25e6.7 (van der Hooft et al.\n1998). The distance to the source, D = 3.2 \u00b1 0.2 kpc was\nderived from jet kinematics (Hjellming & Rupen 1995). The\nc\u00a9 2001 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201313\nRelativistic accretion disc 7\nmass function was first obtained by Bailyn et al. (1995b)\nand then improved by Orosz & Bailyn (1997), who found\nfM = 3.24 \u00b1 0.09M\u2299 and classified the companion star as\nF3 iv\u2013F6 iv. In the same paper Orosz & Bailyn determined\nthe mass of the compact object with unprecedented accu-\nracy, finding MX = 7.02 \u00b1 0.22M\u2299. However, Shahbaz et\nal. (1999) pointed out that in calculating the radial veloc-\nity semi-amplitude, Orosz & Bailyn (1997) used observations\nboth during X-ray quiescence and during an X-ray outburst,\nwhich could lead to an incorrect result. Shahbaz et al. (1999)\nused only the X-ray quiescence data, and found different\nvalue of the mass function, fM = 2.73 \u00b1 0.09M\u2299, the mass\nratio, q = 0.337\u20130.436, and the compact object mass, M =\n5.5\u20137.9M\u2299 (95 per cent confidence). With this mass, GRO\nJ1655\u201340 is one of the most firmly established black hole\ncandidates.\nSeveral authors have tried to estimate the black hole\nspin in GRO J1655\u201340, however they came up with different\nand conflicting conclusions. Zhang et al. (1997a) fitted the\nAugust 1995 ASCA data of the source with the MCD model\nwith relativistic corrections. They found the inner disc ra-\ndius of 23 km for a 7M\u2299 black hole, significantly smaller than\nthe marginally stable orbit radius in the Schwarzschild met-\nric, Rms = 62 km. Their conclusion is that GRO J1655\u201340\ncontains a Kerr black hole rotating at 0.7\u20131.0 of the maxi-\nmum rate. Sobczak et al. (1999) applied a similar approach\nto soft state RXTE observations, finding average inner disc\nradius of Rin = 4.2Rg . They associated this radius with the\nmarginally stable orbit corresponding to the spin of a = 0.5.\nTaking into account uncertainties in the spectral hardening\nfactor, fcol, and the distance to the source, they concluded\nthat a < 0.7. Makishima et al. (2000) applied the relativis-\ntic accretion disc model in Schwarzschild metric to the same\ndata and found that if the black hole is not rotating, its\nmass, M = 2.9 \u00b1 0.1M\u2299, is incompatible with optical con-\nstraints, therefore there must be a rotating black hole in\nGRO J1655\u201340.\nAn alternative approach to estimating the black hole\nspin is analysis of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) ob-\nserved in the power spectra. Remillard et al. (1999) anal-\nysed RXTE observations of GRO J1655\u201340 and found four\ncharacteristic QPOs. Three of them occupy relatively stable\nfrequencies of about 0.1, 9 and 300 Hz. Cui, Zhang & Chen\n(1997) associated the highest frequency QPO with the nodal\nprecession frequency of the tilted disc and derived a = 0.95.\nOn the other hand, Stella, Vietri & Morsink (1999) inter-\npreted the highest frequency QPO in terms of the perias-\ntron precession frequency, and the \u223c 9 Hz QPO as a second\nharmonic of the nodal precession frequency. This interpre-\ntation yielded a \u223c 0.1. Gruzinov (1999) linked the \u223c 300 Hz\nQPO with the emission of the bright spot at the radius of\nthe maximal proper radiation flux, and inferred a \u223c 0.6.\nIn X-rays GRO J1655\u201340 is highly variable and under-\ngoes spectral transitions similar to that of classical X-ray\nnovae. Ueda et al. (1998) analysed the four ASCA obser-\nvations between August 1994 and March 1996. They dis-\ntinguished four distinct states, named \u201chigh\u201d, \u201clow\u201d, \u201cdip\u201d\nand \u201coff\u201d. The high state was observed by BATSE during\nthe outburst in the energy range of 20\u2013100 keV (Tavani et al.\n1996; Zhang et al. 1997b), while the low state corresponds to\ntimes when the source was weak also in the BATSE range.\nThis high state can be associated with the soft state, since\nits spectrum is dominated by the ultra-soft disc component\nwith additional high-energy power law. Zhang et al. (1997b)\nfound the power-law photon spectral index of \u0393 = 2.43\u00b10.3\nfrom the BATSE data simultaneous to the ASCA observa-\ntion analysed in this paper. A long-time RXTE monitoring\n(Sobczak et al. 1999) shows that the soft state can be de-\nscribed by the MCD model with kTin \u223c 0.7 keV plus a power\nlaw with photon spectral index of \u0393 \u223c 2\u20133.\n3.2.2 Spectral fits\nGRO J1655\u201340 was observed by ASCA on August 15\u201316,\n1995. This is the observation from epoch III from Ueda et al.\n(1998), who associated it the high X-ray state of the source.\nFrom this observation we have extracted the GIS spectrum\nwith the net exposure of 3810 s after dead-time correction.\nWe use the data in the 1.0\u201310 keV range.\nWe assume the distance to the source, D = 3.2 kpc\n(Hjellming & Rupen 1995), and the inclination angle of\n70\u25e6 (Orosz & Bailyn 1997; van der Hooft et al. 1998), un-\nless stated otherwise. We do not impose any constraints on\nthe black hole mass during the fits, but check its consis-\ntency with the limits obtained from the optical observations,\n5.5M\u2299 \u2264M \u2264 7.9M\u2299 (Shahbaz et al. 1999; see Section 3.2),\na posteriori.\nThe high-energy tail beyond the disc spectrum is less\nsignificant than in the case of LMC X-1 (see Figures 4 and\n6), and we find that the particular choice between a Comp-\ntonization model and a power law does not affect the disc\nfit results, so we chose a power law with the photon spectral\nindex fixed at \u0393 = 2.4 (Zhang et al. 1997b). On the other\nhand, the tail cannot be neglected. A fit without the tail\nis worse by \u2206\u03c72 = +90 (at 188 d.o.f.) in compare to our\nbest fit (see below) and shows increasing positive residuals\ntowards higher end of the energy band.\nWe fit the data by a model consisting of the GR disc,\npower law and interstellar absorption. First we assume the\ndisc extends down to the marginally stable orbit, rin = rms.\nThe model fits the data fairly well, with \u03c72 \u223c 230\/187, how-\never there is a strong residual pattern below \u223c 3 keV (see\npanel (b) on Figure 6). The pattern is likely to be gener-\nated by atomic processes. However, the interstellar absorp-\ntion, both on neutral and ionized matter, cannot explain\nthis pattern. Varying elemental abundances in the absorber\ndoes not improve the fit. Also, the pattern cannot be fit-\nted by ionized Compton reflection. We notice that relativis-\ntically broadened edge is required to explain the observed\nspectrum.\nTherefore, we included a smeared absorption edge\n(smedge model in xspec; Ebisawa 1991) in our model spec-\ntrum. smedge is only a phenomenological formula invented\nto reproduce the relativistic smearing and its parameters\nshould not be taken as real physical quantities. In particular,\nwhen the smearing is introduced the model edge threshold\nenergy is lower than the rest frame threshold energy of the\nphysical edge. We have found that inclusion of the absorp-\ntion edge improves the fit considerably, yielding much bet-\nter \u03c72 \u223c 165\/185. The smearing width of the edge is poorly\nconstrained around \u223c 0.5 keV, so we fix it at this value dur-\ning all fits. The threshold energy, typically 1.25\u00b1 0.05 keV,\nmight be consistent with the Ne-like Fe L-shell absorption\nedge (at 1.26 keV), originating in the ionized disc.

For comparison, on panel (b) we present\nthe residuals of the fit without absorption edge.\nanalysis of this feature is however beyond the scope of this\npaper.\nFinally, our best-fitting model consists of the GR disc,\nthe power law, the interstellar absorption and the absorption\nedge. Fit results for five values of the black hole spin are\npresented in Table 2. The data and the best-fitting model\nfor a = 0.75 are shown on Figure 6.\nAs it was in the case of LMC X-1, spectral fits do not\nconstrain the black hole spin. However, the spin can be con-\nstrained taking into account mass limitations. Only the fit\nwith a = 0.75, yieldingM = 5.84+0.06\u22120.05M\u2299, is consistent with\nthe mass constraint of (5.5\u20137.9)M\u2299 , inferred from the opti-\ncal observations by Shahbaz et al. (1999). Again, we fit the\ndata in a range of inclination angles and compute 90 per\ncent confidential contours for inclination-mass relation. The\nresult is presented on Figure 7. Due to better quality of the\ndata and due to the fact that GRO J1655\u201340 spectrum is\ndominated by the disc emission, these contours are much\nnarrower than in the case of LMC X-1. Only the a = 0.75\ncontour overlaps with the shaded area indicating allowable\nvalues of the inclination angle and the mass. More precise\nlimits on the spin can be found by interpolating between the\nvalues found from the fits. If the GR effects are neglected,\nfor the given spectrum the disc must keep constant inner ra-\ndius while varying M and a. Providing that rin = rms, this\nleads to a simple relation between the mass and the spin\nM \u221d r\u22121ms (a), where rms(a) is given by equation (3). The GR\neffects modify this relation and we have found that a func-\ntion M = C1 +C2r\n\u22121\nms (a) approximates the data well, so we\nuse it for interpolation.

In this range of spin values return-\ning radiation is negligible (see Section 2), and does not affect\nour result.\nNext, we fit the data allowing the inner disc radius, rin,\nto be a free parameter. The results are presented in Table 3.\nIn all fits we find that the inner disc radius is consistent with\nrms, however larger values are possible. Now the a = 0.998\nfit became acceptable with M = 10+6.3\u22126.4M\u2299. Since the upper\nlimits for the mass remained virtually the same after freeing\nrin (see Tables 2 and 3), the lower limit on the spin also\nremained the same, a \u2265 0.68, this time.\nWithin the acceptable range of M , D and i (assuming\nrin = rms) the relative accretion rate, m\u02d9d, is between \u223c 0.6\nand \u223c 1.9. In terms of the radiated power it corresponds\nto a fraction \u03b7m\u02d9d \u223c 0.1\u20130.2 of the Eddington luminosity.\nThe unabsorbed bolometric luminosity of the disc in GRO\nJ1655\u201340, computed from the model, is (1.2\u20131.6)\u00d7 1038 erg\ns\u22121 (1.4\u00d7 1038 erg s\u22121 at D = 3.2 kpc). In the observed en-\nergy range only a small fraction of the luminosity is radiated\nin the tail.\n4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n4.1 Black hole mass and spin\nOptical and UV observations of black hole binaries can pro-\nvide with the mass function, which in turn can help estimat-\ning, to some extent, the black hole mass and the inclination\nangle of the binary. We know about a dozen of X-ray Galac-\ntic binaries for which the mass function implies the compact\nobject mass larger than 3M\u2299, making them good candidates\nfor black holes. However, the black hole spin cannot be es-\ntimated this way.\nc\u00a9 2001 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201313\nRelativistic accretion disc 9\nTable 2.

The model depends on five basic parameters:\nthe black hole mass and spin, the disc inclination angle,\nthe accretion rate and the inner disc radius. Generally, the\nspectral shape changes only slightly with these parameters,\nand only two out of them can be established uniquely by\nfitting the observational data. Additional assumptions about\nsome of the parameters are necessary. In most of our fits we\nhave fixed i and assumed rin = rms. Then, for several fixed\nvalues of a we have successfully fitted M and M\u02d9 . Results\npresented in Tables 1 and 2 show that \u03c72 remained virtually\nthe same through the whole range of a and the black hole\nspin cannot be reckoned this way. On the other hand, at a\ngiven spectral shape there is strong correlation between the\nparameters, in particular between M and a when i and rin\nare fixed. With an independent estimation of the mass and\nthe inclination angle, we can constrain the black hole spin.\nThe tighter constraints on the mass and the inclination, the\nmore accurate spin estimation can be obtained.\nThe mass and the inclination angle of LMC X-1 are\nevaluated rather poorly. Therefore, it is not possible to give\na good constrain on the black hole spin. We can only rule out\na black hole which is close to, or maximally rotating. GRO\nJ1655\u201340 gave us better chance. The mass and the inclina-\ntion angle are measured with relatively high accuracy. Also,\ndue to better quality of the X-ray data, we have obtained\nsmaller statistical errors on M . As a result, we could limit\nthe spin, 0.68 \u2264 a \u2264 0.88 (when rin = rms). This result is\nonly weakly affected by neglecting returning photons, which\nare negligible for spin less then 0.9.\nWe underline, that when we allow for free rin > rms, no\nupper limit for the black hole spin can be imposed. This is\nbecause for a given spectral shape increase of rin with fixed\nM and i leads to increase of a. However, there are clues that\nthe accretion disc in BHB extends down to the marginally\nstable orbit all the time in the soft (high or very high) state.\nLong-term 1996-1997 RXTE monitoring of GRO\nJ1655\u201340 (Sobczak et al. 1999) shows remarkable constancy\nof the MCD inner disc radius over the period of a few hun-\ndred days, while the source went through the high and very\nhigh spectral states. There is an exception of a few ob-\nservations during the very high state, where the inner ra-\ndius dropped suddenly by factor \u223c 3. Merloni, Fabian &\nRoss (2000) interpret it as a drop in the disc accretion rate,\nwhich caused increase of the hardening factor and decrease\nof the apparent inner radius, while the actual rin has not\nchanged. If the inner disc radius remained constant indeed,\nit is reasonable to assume that the disc extended down to\nthe marginally stable orbit all the time when the source was\nin the high or very high state, including also the ASCA ob-\nservation analysed in this paper.\nLong-term 1996-1998 RXTE monitoring of LMC X-1\n(Wilms et al. 2001) shows in turn significant variations of\nthe MCD inner disc radius. However, it is not clear whether\nthese variations can be attributed to real changes of rin.\nThey might be, at least in part, due to systematic errors in\nthe model.\nSo, does rin vary during the soft state or not? If the\ncold disc in either of the above observations was indeed trun-\ncated, it should turn into an optically thin inner flow below\nrin. Hot plasma in the inner flow could be a source of the\nhigh-energy tail beyond the disc spectrum. However, opti-\ncally thin solution can exist only for luminosities lower than\na few per cent of the Eddington luminosity. At higher accre-\ntion rates (and higher densities) Coulomb transfer of energy\nfrom the protons to the electrons becomes efficient, the op-\ntically thin flow becomes radiatively efficient and collapses\nto the optically thick Shakura-Sunyaev disc (Chen et al.\n1995; Esin, McClintock & Narayan 1997). In both observa-\ntions analysed in this paper luminosity exceeded 10 per cent\nof LEdd, therefore we should not expect any hot, optically\nthin flow. Instead, we propose that the cold disc extends all\nthe way down to the marginally stable orbit, and the high-\nenergy tail emission is produced in active regions above the\ndisc. Hence, we find the assumption of rin = rms as well\nfounded, and our best constraint on the black hole spin in\nc\u00a9 2001 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201313\n10 M. Gierlin\u00b4ski, A. Macio lek-Niedz\u00b4wiecki and K. Ebisawa\nGRO J1655\u201340 is 0.68 \u2264 a \u2264 0.88 and in LMC X-1 we rule\na black hole rotating with the spin close to maximum.\nThe most spectacular feature of GRO J1655\u201340 is its\nradio jets (Tingay et al. 1995; Hjellming & Rupen 1995), ob-\nserved also in another high-spin black hole candidate, GRS\n1915+105 (Mirabel & Rodr\u00b4\u0131guez 1994). Co-existence of rel-\nativistic jets and rotating black holes in BHB makes and in-\nteresting link to the problem of radio dichotomy of quasars,\nand supports the black hole \u201cspin paradigm\u201d, according to\nwhich jets in quasars are powered by rotating black holes\n(e.g. Moderski, Sikora & Lasota 1998). Since no strong ra-\ndio jets were found in LMC X-1, the non-rotating black hole\nshould be expected in this system. Unfortunately, our re-\nsults do not allow us to make such claims. Further system-\natic studies of several jet and non-jet sources could provide\nwith more evidences for the spin paradigm.\n4.2 Compton reflection\nThe X-ray spectra of LMC X-1 and GRO J1655\u201340 are sim-\nilar to the soft state spectrum of Cyg X-1 (Gierlin\u00b4ski et al.\n1999), though the first two sources are significantly brighter.\nAn important difference is that we do not find Compton re-\nflection features here, while Cyg X-1 in the soft state showed\nstrong reflection component with covering angle \u2126\/2pi \u223c 0.7\nand a broad Fe K\u03b1 line. This can be explained by the in-\nstrumental limitations or\/and by the intrinsic difference in\nthe source geometry and energetics. The Compton reflection\nfrom the cold matter can be identified by Fe K\u03b1 features\naround 7 keV and by reflection continuum, which peaks\naround 30 keV in the EFE spectrum. Since ASCA can ob-\nserve only up to \u223c 10 keV, the detection of the reflection\ncontinuum with ASCA data only might be difficult, if not\nimpossible. The iron K edge and line parameters are sensi-\ntive to the shape of the underlying continuum, which can-\nnot be properly established without the high-energy data.\nFor example, Dotani et al. (1997) analysed the ASCA data\nof Cyg X-1 and did not find any Fe line. Gierlin\u00b4ski et al.\n(1999) re-analysed the same data jointly with the simulta-\nneous RXTE observation, and found the presence of the\niron line with high statistical significance. LMC X-1 spec-\ntrum has poor statistics above \u223c 5 keV, so the reflection\nfeatures can escape the detection. The high-energy tail in\nGRO J1655\u201340 is much weaker than in Cyg X-1. At 7 keV\nthe disc radiates \u223c 3.5 times more energy than the tail.\nTherefore, the Fe K-shell features will be very weak in the\ntotal spectrum, and difficult to detect. In the soft state of\nCyg X-1 the situation is opposite: the disc emission at 7 keV\nis negligible (see Figure 8 in Gierlin\u00b4ski et al. 1999 and Figure\n4 in this paper). Moreover, the Fe K-shell features coming\nfrom the disc around the fast-spinning black hole are signif-\nicantly smeared, which additionally hinders the detection.\nWe note, that ASCA and RXTE detected characteristic\niron features in GRO J1655\u201340, at different periods (Ueda et\nal. 1998; Tomsick et al. 1999; Ba lucin\u00b4ska-Church & Church\n2000; Yamaoka et al. 2000). However, precise ASCA\/RXTE\nobservations show that these features can be consistently ex-\nplained by resonant absorption lines in the corona above the\ndisc without reflection components (Yamaoka et al. 2000).\n4.3 Disc stability\nAn unclear issue is stability of the cold disc. Both sources\nare very bright with luminosities being a significant frac-\ntion of the Eddington luminosity (m\u02d9d \u223c 1\u20135 is a very con-\nservative limit for LMC X-1). A radiation pressure dom-\ninated region, which is thought to be unstable, arises in\nthe disc above the critical accretion rate, m\u02d9crit. In the\npseudo-Newtonian approximation, for a 10M\u2299 black hole\nand \u03b1 = 0.1, m\u02d9crit \u2248 0.64 (Gierlin\u00b4ski et al. 1999; taking into\naccount accretion in the cold disc only, i.e. f = 0). Therefore,\nthe discs in both sources seem to be dominated by the radia-\ntion pressure. Since we consider here rotating black holes, we\nchecked this result by calculating the ratio of the radiation\npressure to the gas pressure in the Kerr metric (Novikov &\nThorne 1972), for all acceptable fit parameters in Tables 1\nand 2. We found that in both sources the inner part of the\ncold accretion disc below several tens of Rg is dominated by\nthe radiation pressure indeed. Thus, both discs should be\nunstable against secular and thermal instabilities. However,\ndespite this inconvenience the discs in LMC X-1 and GRO\nJ1655\u201340 apparently do exist.\nThis riddle probably arises from our lack of understand-\ning of microscopic mechanisms of accretion. The instability\ndevelops in the standard \u03b1-prescription theory, where r\u03c6-\nelement of the viscous stress tensor, Tr\u03c6, is proportional to\nthe total pressure, i.e. to the sum of the gas pressure and\nthe radiation pressure. The viscosity parameter \u03b1 includes\nnot well understood physics of viscosity, which is supposed\nto be due to chaotic magnetic fields and turbulence in the\ngas flow. It is not quite clear why Tr\u03c6 should be proportional\nto the total pressure. If we assume that Tr\u03c6 is proportional\nto the gas pressure only (the so-called \u03b2-disc; see e.g. Stella\n& Rosner 1984), the disc becomes stable in the radiation\npressure dominated region (Figure 8). The existence of the\nradiation pressure dominated discs should impose significant\nconstraints on the theoretical models of viscosity in the ac-\ncretion flow.\n4.4 Model reliability\nOne important question we should ask is reliability of the\nmodel and parameters inferred. While modelling the disc\nspectrum in the \u201cproper\u201d way one should solve the following\nfour problems. (i) The radial disc structure, (ii) the vertical\ndisc structure, (iii) the radiation transfer and (iv) the rela-\ntivistic effects. Our understanding of the first three problems\nis poor and there are still a lot of open questions concern-\ning the viscosity prescription, vertical distribution of gravi-\ntational energy dissipation, effects of radiation pressure and\nirradiation of the disc, importance of bound-free opacity and\nheavy elements, and importance of Comptonization, just to\nname the most important issues. Consequently, every single\nprediction available in the literature is based on simplifying\nassumptions and is model dependent. On the other hand, the\nsimplest solution, i.e. the sum of blackbodies gives the best\ndescription of the observational data. For example, a smooth\nmulticolour spectrum with no ionization edges consistently\nreproduces the AGN observations in which the Lyman edge\n(expected by more advanced models) is not observed. As we\nhave shown in this chapter, the multicolour model fits the\nblack hole candidate spectra perfectly as well.\nc\u00a9 2001 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201313\nRelativistic accretion disc 11\nFigure 8. Two solutions of the optically thick disc around a\n10M\u2299 non-rotating black hole at the radius of the most significant\ninstability of r = 15.1. The viscosity parameter \u03b1 is 0.1. The left-\nhand curve represents the solution with Tr\u03c6 \u221d Prad + Pgas (\u03b1-\ndisc). The right-hand curve shows the solution with Tr\u03c6 \u221d Pgas\n(\u03b2-disc). The shaded region shows the most conservative limits\non the disc accretion rate of LMC X-1 at a = 0. The dashed\nline represents the Eddington luminosity (efficiency \u03b7 = 1\/16).\nThe inner disc is dominated by the radiation pressure, where the\n\u03b1-disc solution is unstable and the \u03b2-disc solution is stable.\nWe correct the emerging spectra for two effects that\nsignificantly affect measurements of the disc normalization\nand temperature. The first one is a deep gravitational po-\ntential in the vicinity of a fast rotating black hole. All special\nand general relativistic effects are treated to high accuracy\nby means of the transfer function, as was described in Sec-\ntion 2. The second important aspect is the effect of electron\nscattering, which we approximate by a single colour tem-\nperature correction factor, fcol, using a diluted blackbody\nas a local spectrum (see Section 2). Under certain simplify-\ning assumptions Shimura & Takahara (1995) computed the\nvertical disc structure around a Schwarzschild stellar-mass\nblack hole and solved the radiation transfer. They found that\nfor the viscosity parameter \u03b1 = 0.1 the local spectrum can\nbe represented by a diluted blackbody when Comptoniza-\ntion is effective, which takes place in the inner disc region\nwhen m\u02d9d >\u223c 1. For M = 10M\u2299 and m\u02d9d = 1 they found that\nthe sum of diluted blackbodies fits the whole disc spectrum\nvery well with the best-fitting hardening factor of fcol = 1.7\n(see Figure 2 in Shimura & Takahra 1995). Merloni et al.\n(2000) made a similar comparison between the multicolour\ndisc and a more realistic disc model with the vertical tem-\nperature structure and radiation transfer solved and came\nup with a comparable result. The multicolour disc spectra\nfit the realistic disc spectra well, and for m\u02d9d >\u223c 1 the hard-\nening factor is fcol \u2248 1.8. In both observations in this paper\nm\u02d9d \u223c 1, therefore, within the trustworthiness limits of the\nShimura & Takahara and Merloni et al. calculations, we find\nour model reliable. A small variation in the hardening factor\ndoes not change our results significantly. For example, the\nGRO J1655\u201340 spin for fcol = 1.8 is 0.60 \u2264 a \u2264 0.83.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank Andrzej A. Zdziarski and Chris Done for dis-\ncussions and valuable comments.

In both\nappendices we use G = c = 1 units, the (\u2212+++) signature\nand the Boyer-Lindquist coordinates, (t, R, \u03b8, \u03c6). Non-zero\ncomponents of the metric tensor are given by\ngtt = \u2212(1\u2212 2r\/\u03a3),\ngt\u03c6 = \u22122ar sin2 \u03b8\/\u03a3,\ng\u03c6\u03c6 =\n(\nr2 + a2 +\n2a2r sin2 \u03b8\n\u03a3\n)\nsin2 \u03b8,\ngrr = \u03a3\/\u2206,\ng\u03b8\u03b8 = \u03a3, (A1)\nwhere\n\u2206 = r2 + a2 \u2212 2r,\n\u03a3 = r2 + a2 cos2 \u03b8, (A2)\nand we use dimensionless distance and specific angular mo-\nmentum parameter\nr =\nR\nM\n, a =\nJ\nM2\n. (A3)\nOur approach to calculation of the disc photon trajec-\ntories mostly follows that of Cunningham (1975). A null\ngeodesic in the Kerr metric is described by two constants of\nmotion, \u03bb and \u03be, defined as\n\u03bb =\nL\nEM\n, \u03be2 =\nC\nE2M2\n, (A4)\nwhere E is the photon energy at infinity, L is projection of\nthe photon angular momentum on the symmetry axis and\nC is the Carter constant (in the definition of \u03be we took\ninto account the condition C \u2265 0 satisfied by trajectories\nintersecting equatorial plane.)\nWe take an usual assumption that the radial velocity\nin the disc can be neglected and its motion is Keplerian. In\nthe non-rotating frame, the angular velocity and the linear\nvelocity, respectively, are given by\n\u2126K =\n1\nM\n1\nr3\/2 + a\n, (A5)\nand\nVK =\nA\nr2\n\u221a\n\u2206\n(\n\u03c9K \u2212 2ar\nA\n)\n, (A6)\nwhere\nA = r4 + a2r2 + 2a2r, (A7)\nand \u03c9K = M\u2126K. Then, we get the following relation between\nthe constants of motion and the emission angles in the disc\nrest frame (e.g., Cunningham & Bardeen 1973)\n\u03bb =\nsin \u03b8e sin \u03c6e + VK\n(r2e\u22061\/2 + 2areVK)\/A+ \u03c9K sin \u03b8e sin\u03c6e\n,\n\u03be =\n(\nA\n\u2206\n)1\/2\n(1\u2212 V 2K)\u22121\/2(1\u2212 \u03bb\u03c9K) cos \u03b8e. (A8)\nwhere re is the initial photon radius, \u03b8e is a polar angle\nbetween the photon initial direction and the normal to the\ndisc and \u03c6e is the azimuthal angle, in the disc plane, with\nrespect to the r-direction.\nThen, the redshift of the photon emitted from the disc\nat a distance re is given by\ngeff = re\n(\n\u2206\nA\n)1\/2 (1\u2212 V 2K)1\/2\n1\u2212 \u03c9K\u03bb , (A9)\nand the angle, i, at which the photon will be observed far\nfrom the disc in the flat space-time is determined by the\nintegral equation of motion\n\u00b1\n\u222b\n\u221e\nre\n\u211c\u22121\/2dr =\n\u222b i\npi\/2\n\u0398\u22121\/2d\u03b8. (A10)\nwhere \u211c and \u0398 are radial and polar effective potentials,\nrespectively,\n\u211c(r) = (r2 + a2 \u2212 \u03bba)2 \u2212\u2206\n[\n\u03be2 + (\u03bb\u2212 a)2\n]\n,\n\u0398(\u03b8) = \u03be2 + cos2 \u03b8\n(\na2 \u2212 \u03bb2\/sin2 \u03b8\n)\n. (A11)\nThe photon transfer function is tabulated in discrete\nsteps in five dimensions (a, re, cos i, geff , cos \u03b8e). Generated\nphotons are summed in the appropriate elements of the pho-\nton transfer function table according to the following algo-\nrithm.\nc\u00a9 2001 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201313\nRelativistic accretion disc 13\n(i) for given a and re generate the photon initial direction\nfrom the distribution uniform both in \u03c6e and cos \u03b8e,\n(ii) find the constants of motion from equation (A8),\n(iii) solve equation (A10) for i (initial sign of \u211c in equa-\ntion (A10) is negative for pi\/2 < \u03c6e < 3pi\/2 and positive\notherwise),\n(iv) find geff from equation (A9),\n(v) increment an element of the transfer function table\ncorresponding to a, re, cos i, geff and cos \u03b8e.\nIn order to compute and tabulate the transfer function we\nhave calculated trajectories of 109 photons. The disc is axi-\nally symmetric and emission from a given point of the disc\nis also axially symmetric. Therefore, integration over \u03c6e for\ntrajectories starting at a given point of the disc and observed\nat a given angle i and collected at all angles \u03c6o is equivalent\nto integration over all trajectories starting at a given radius\nre, which are observed at a given angle i and any particular\n\u03c6o.\nAPPENDIX B: TRANSFORMATION OF THE\nPHOTON NUMBER INTENSITY\nAs pointed out in Section 2, application of the photon trans-\nfer function requires transformation of the photon number\nintensity between the reference frames of the distant ob-\nserver (the Boyer-Lindquist coordinate frame) and the ob-\nserver co-rotating with the disc. The latter one is represented\nby the covariant tetrad (we show only the components used\nbelow):\net\n\u2032\n= \u2212r\u22121\n(\n1\u2212 V 2K\n)\u22121\/2 (A\n\u2206\n)1\/2\n\u00d7 (gtt + \u03c9Kgt\u03c6, 0, 0, gt\u03c6 + \u03c9Kg\u03c6\u03c6) ,\ner\n\u2032\n= (0, r\/\n\u221a\n\u2206, 0, 0),\ne\u03c6\n\u2032\n= r\u22121\n(\n1\u2212 V 2K\n)\u22121\/2 (A\n\u2206\n)1\/2 [\nVKgtt + gt\u03c6\n(\nr2\u22061\/2\nA\n+\n2arVK\nA\n)\n, 0, 0, VKgt\u03c6 + g\u03c6\u03c6\n(\nr2\u22061\/2\nA\n+\n2arVK\nA\n)]\n,(B1)\nwhere order of vector components is given by (t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6),\nand primes denote coordinates defined in the disc local rest\nframe. Then, the one-form dt\u2032 can be written in terms of the\nBoyer-Lindquist coordinates as\ndt\u2032 = et\n\u2032\nt dt+ e\nt\u2032\n\u03c6 d\u03c6 (B2)\nAs for the observer at rest in the disc d\u03c6\u2032 = 0, and\nd\u03c6\u2032 = e\u03c6\n\u2032\nt dt+ e\n\u03c6\u2032\n\u03c6 d\u03c6, (B3)\nwe obtain the following relation\ndt\u2032 = \u03b2tdt, (B4)\nwhere\n\u03b2t = e\nt\u2032\nt \u2212 et\n\u2032\n\u03c6 e\n\u03c6\u2032\nt \/e\n\u03c6\u2032\n\u03c6 . (B5)\nSimilarly, for the disc unit area we find\ndr\u2032d\u03c6\u2032 = er\n\u2032\nr dr\n(\ne\u03c6\n\u2032\nt dt+ e\n\u03c6\u2032\n\u03c6 d\u03c6\n)\n= \u03b2Sdrd\u03c6 (B6)\n(in the latter equality we have used the condition dt\u2032 = 0,\nrelevant for the three-space measurements in the disc rest\nframe), where\n\u03b2S = e\nr\u2032\nr\n(\ne\u03c6\n\u2032\n\u03c6 \u2212 et\n\u2032\n\u03c6 e\n\u03c6\u2032\nt \/e\nt\u2032\nt\n)\n. (B7)\nThe factor \u03b2S gives correction for the integral element drd\u03c6\nin equation (1) (integration over \u03c6 is hidden in the convo-\nlution) which should be taken into account in calculation of\nthe number of photons emitted from the accretion disc.\nc\u00a9 2001 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201313\n"}
