The fundamental discoveries of the Bose-Einstein\ncondensation2\u20134 of exciton-polaritons and their superfluidity5\nat elevated temperatures have paved the way toward the re-\nalization of a new generation of optoelectronic devices.6\nFrom the technological point of view the nonlinear optical\neffects linked with exciton-polaritons are of particular inter-\nest. The recently demonstrated optical bistability in a biased\nmicrocavity with an extraordinarily low switching power7\ndemonstrates the feasibility of optical integrated circuits\nbased on \u201cpolariton neurons\u201d in planar microcavities.8 In or-\nder to produce such devices, exciton-polaritons in microcavi-\nties must be confined in lateral channels, where the propaga-\ntion of domains of high-density exciton-polariton liquid may\nbe controlled by external light or electrical bias. Recently it\nwas shown that such channeling of polaritons is possible\nusing hybrid Tamm-plasmon\u2013exciton-polariton modes\n\u0002TPEPMs\u0003 which are formed under thin metallic stripes de-\nposited on the top of a planar semiconductor microcavity.9\u201311\nTPEPM states are redshifted from the bare cavity polariton\nmodes by several meV, which provides efficient one-\ndimensional confinement. Exciton-polariton transistors,\nswitches, and logic gates based on TPEPMs would operate at\ngigahertz frequencies, have extremely low switching power,\nand be easily integrated on a chip.\nThe development of practical optical integrated circuits\nwould represent a revolutionary breakthrough in modern op-\ntoelectronics, making possible ultrafast information process-\ning with extremely low losses. However, the realization of\noptical integrated circuits is a complex task which cannot be\nachieved without exploiting new physical effects, device\nconcepts, and technological approaches. We propose exploit-\ning the newly discovered effects of polariton-mediated opti-\ncal bistability, plasmon-polariton coupling, and propagation\nof polariton domain walls in microcavities in a concept of an\noptical integrated circuit. It is based on several ideas,\nnamely: \u0002i\u0003 bistable switching of the optically driven polar-\niton state due to nonlinear polariton-polariton interactions,12\nwhich has been experimentally observed recently;13,14 \u0002ii\u0003\nchanneling of polaritons below metallic stripes due to the\nhybridization of the Tamm-plasmon states and cavity\nexciton-polaritons; \u0002iii\u0003 electrical control of the detuning be-\ntween the exciton-polariton mode and the pumping laser due\nto the quantum confined Stark effect; and \u0002iv\u0003 propagation of\ndomain walls between different bistable states.\nPolariton transistor scheme. Figure 1\u0002a\u0003 shows schemati-\ncally our proposed building block of future polariton inte-\ngrated circuits: a polariton spin transistor. The figure illus-\ntrates a conventional planar microcavity in which Bragg\nmirrors confine light so that it interacts strongly with exci-\ntons in a quantum well. However, in addition our structure\nhas a patterned metal structure on the top surface, compris-\ning a chain of four segments. The band structure of exciton-\npolariton modes in a microcavity can be strongly affected by\nthe presence of a metallic layer on the top of the structure \u0004as\napparent in Fig. 1\u0002c\u0003\u0005, and this can be used to provide the\nlateral confinement necessary for integrated circuits. The\nthicknesses of the metallic layer and of the semiconductor\nlayer next to it determine the energy of the Tamm-plasmon\nmode localized at the metal-Bragg mirror interface.9\u201311 If the\nTamm plasmon is strongly detuned from the cavity polariton\nmodes, the effect of the metal is to blueshift the cavity modes\nby \u00060.4 eV.4 On the other hand, if the Tamm plasmon is put\nin resonance with the cavity polaritons, a new hybrid\nTPEPM can appear, which has components of the exciton\nstate, cavity photon, and Tamm plasmon. The lowest TPEPM\nis redshifted with respect to the lowest bare cavity polariton\nmode, with the size of the shift dependent on the exciton\noscillator strength and the parameters of the Bragg mirror\nbetween the cavity and metal.11 For applications in polariton\nintegrated circuits at low temperatures, a shift of about 5\nmeV would provide sufficient lateral confinement, and this\ncan be easily achieved in GaAs-based structures. For room-\ntemperature operation, the larger lateral confinement poten-\ntial necessary can be achieved in GaN-based systems. Selec-\ntive optical excitation of the TPEPM is achieved by tuning\nthe photon energy of a continuous-wave \u0002cw\u0003 laser to lie\nbetween the lowest TPEPM and the lowest cavity polariton\nmode outside the channel. In this case, there is no absorption\nof light in the regions of the sample not covered by metal.\nTPEPMs are confined in the channels and the lowest TPEPM\nPHYSICAL REVIEW B 82, 033302 \u00022010\u0003\n1098-0121\/2010\/82\u00023\u0003\/033302\u00024\u0003 \u00a92010 The American Physical Society033302-1\nabsorbs laser light only if its energy is tuned to the laser\nenergy. This tuning can be achieved and controlled by the\napplication of an electric field across the cavity \u0002in the direc-\ntion normal to the cavity plane\u0003. An electric field affects the\nexciton energy and oscillator strength due to the quantum\nconfined Stark effect, which leads to the shift of the TPEPMs\nas well. Electric fields to control the local TPEPM energy\nselectively can be produced by applying a potential differ-\nence relative to the structure\u2019s back contact to one or more of\nthe four metallic segments.\nFigure 1\u0002b\u0003 shows the response of the polariton density to\nthe intensity of a circularly polarized cw optical pump. The\ndifferent curves represent the cases of different detunings\nbetween the optical pump photon energy and the lowest\nTPEPM energy \u0002we define the detuning as that measured in\nthe low-density regime rather than defining a renormalized\ndetuning\u0003. By varying the electrical potential applied to a\nsegment the detuning in its locality can be varied and a par-\nticular response as represented by the curves in Fig. 1\u0002b\u0003 can\nbe selected \u0004an increase in the applied electric field causes an\nincreased redshift of the TPEPM energy as shown in Fig.\n1\u0002d\u0003; see also discussion below\u0005. We consider a device with\nthe initial condition that all segments have the same applied\npotential and hence the same detuning \u00030. Illuminating the\nwhole system by a broad area optical pump, each segment is\ninitially in a low polariton density state of the TPEPM \u0004given\nby the intersection between the vertical gray line and the\nlower branch of the \u0002red\u0003 solid curve in Fig. 1\u0002b\u0003\u0005.\nA signal in the structure can be triggered by lowering the\npotential applied to the first segment so that the local detun-\ning is reduced to the value \u00031, corresponding to the \u0002green\u0003\ndashed S-shaped curve in Fig. 1\u0002b\u0003. We expect the change in\nthe potential to cause a major increase in the polariton den-\nsity \u0004given by the point where the vertical gray line intersects\nthe \u0002green\u0003 dashed curve\u0005. Furthermore, polaritons have a\nparticularly light effective mass, which allows them to\npropagate over micron-scale distances during their short life-\ntime. The high population of polaritons in the first segment\nthus begins to spread, tunneling across the narrow gap into\nthe second segment. As a result the increasing polariton\npopulation in the area just inside the second segment\nswitches to the upper branch of the \u0002red\u0003 solid S-shaped\ncurve in Fig. 1\u0002b\u0003. This switching effect continues across the\nwhole segment and indeed across segments later in the chain.\nIn analogy with biological neurons, the signal is carried as a\npropagating change in the state of the system along the chan-\nnel. While the signal of a biological neuron is encoded as a\nswitch in the relative concentrations of charged ions across\nthe axon membrane, a polariton neuron encodes the signal as\na switch in the local polariton density. Note that just as bio-\nlogical neurons do not rely on charged ions traveling down\nthe whole length of the neuron, the same is the case with\npolaritons in polariton neurons. Therefore, the signal can\npropagate substantially further than the distance a single po-\nlariton can be expected to travel\u2014in fact the signal is able to\npropagate to the edge of the cw optical field.\nExciton redshift due to an applied electric field. Before\npresenting theoretical modeling of our proposed device, we\ngive details on how the exciton redshift can be related to an\napplied electric field. Although excitons localized in the\nquantum well are electrically neutral, their components\n\u0002electrons and holes\u0003 have opposite electric charges and\ntherefore interact with the electric field. As a result, an ap-\nplied electric field leads to distortion of the exciton wave\nfunction and to the change in the exciton energy and the\nexciton oscillator strength.15\u201317 To determine the exciton en-\nergy, we use the model of Ref. 16 with a separable exciton\ntrial wave function of the form\n\u0004\u0002r\u0002e,r\u0002h,ze,zh\u0003 =\u0004\u0007\u0002r\u0002e,r\u0002h\u0003\u0004e\u0002ze\u0003\u0004h\u0002zh\u0003 , \u00021\u0003\nwhere the unperturbed exciton in-plane wave function is\n\u0004\u0007\u0002r\u0002e,r\u0002h\u0003 =\b 2\n\u0005aB\n2 exp\t\u2212 \nr\u0002e \u2212 r\u0002h\naB \u000b , \u00022\u0003\nin which aB is the two-dimensional exciton Bohr radius and\nr\u0002e,h are the in-plane components of the electron and hole\nspatial coordinates.

E\u02c6 LP\nis the kinetic-energy operator, which should account for the\nnonparabolic dispersion of polaritons. The eigenvalues of\nE\u02c6 LP can be written in reciprocal space as\nELP\u0002k\u0002\u0003 =\nEC\u0002k\u0002\u0003 + EX\u0002k\u0002\u0003\n2\n\u2212\n1\n2\n\b\u0004EC\u0002k\u0002\u0003 \u2212 EX\u0002k\u0002\u0003\u00052 +\r2, \u00027\u0003\nwhere \r is the Rabi splitting and EC and EX are the bare\ncavity photon and exciton energies, respectively, for which\nwe take parabolic dispersion relations characterized by effec-\ntive masses mC and mX. Returning to Eq. \u00026\u0003, \n represents the\npolariton lifetime and \u000b represents the strength of polariton-\npolariton interactions. W\u0002r\u0002 , t\u0003 is the potential experienced by\npolaritons, which is spatially dependent due to the metallic\nstructure built into the microcavity design, and is time de-\npendent because of the changes in potential applied to the\nmetallic segments.\nEquation \u00026\u0003 can be solved numerically with the initial\ncondition \b\u0002r\u0002 , t=0\u0003=0. In our calculations we used the fol-\nlowing parameters, typical for state-of-the-art GaAs-based\nmicrocavities:7 \r=10 meV, mC=3\u000e10\u22125m \u0002m is the free-\nelectron mass\u0003, mX=0.22m, \n=3 ps, \u00030=0.5 meV, \u00031\n=0.4 meV, and \u00032=0.8 meV. It was assumed that the metal\nstrip causes a 5 meV redshift of the TPEPM beneath it with\nrespect to the lowest-energy exciton-polariton mode else-\nwhere.\nIn Fig. 2 it is apparent that the signal propagates across all\nfour segments. The signal propagation observed in Fig. 2 is\ndependent on maintaining the potential bias in the second,\nthird, and fourth segments so that the detuning remains as\n\u00030. If we were to switch the potential in the third segment so\nthat the local detuning had the substantially larger value of\n\u00032, corresponding to the \u0002blue\u0003 dotted curve in Fig. 1\u0002b\u0003, the\nsignal would not be able to propagate between the second\nand fourth segments. The results of modeling this case are\nshown in Fig. 3 and demonstrate that the device can behave\nas an electro-optic transistor in which the optical signal is\nelectrically controlled. The whole device can be reset by\ntemporarily applying a potential corresponding to a detuning\nof \u00032 to all segments.\nOther functionalities are also straightforward to produce\nusing polariton neurons. Signals can be duplicated by split-\nting channels or combined in OR logic gates simply by com-\nbining channels.8 Polariton neurons are also able to link mul-\ntiple elements in a circuit together, a facility not afforded by\nmany other optical logic element concepts. Without requiring\nexternal optics \u0002other than a single broad excitation field\u0003 a\npolariton neuron-based optical circuit fits comfortably into a\nsingle compact microcavity.

Initially the intensity in the first seg-\nment increases. Polaritons then propagate into the second region\nwhere there is a switching to the higher intensity state allowed by\nbistability. The polariton signal continues to a distance limited by\nthe extent of the optical pump \u0002which has a 40 \u000fm half-width at\nhalf-maximum in the x direction in the calculation\u0003.\nBRIEF REPORTS PHYSICAL REVIEW B 82, 033302 \u00022010\u0003\n033302-3\nresponding to a repetition rate of 5\u201310 GHz. The power re-\nquirements are also favorable; the high strength of exciton-\nexciton interactions makes it possible to achieve the\nnonlinear regime needed for bistability with relatively low\noptical power. For example, a power of 2.8 mW has been\nused to achieve bistability in GaAs-based microcavities.13\nFuture samples, perhaps based on GaN, are expected to op-\nerate at even lower powers, partly due to the increased\nexciton-exciton interaction strength and partly due to higher\ncavity Q factors.\nWe have shown how the electrical sensitivity of optical\nbistability in semiconductor microcavities could be used to\nconstruct a new generation of electro-optical devices with\ncompact size and low power consumption. Although we have\nfocused on fully integrated electro-optical logic circuits, it is\nalso possible to imagine using the electrical control of polar-\niton intensity as the basis of bistable memory devices, which\ncould switch on time scales on the order of the polariton\nlifetime \u0002\u00063 ps\u0003 and have long memory lifetimes, at least as\nlong as the laser coherence time. In another application, a\nsuitably patterned metallic structure could provide the spatial\ncontrol to produce an array of bistable elements acting as a\nspatial light modulator. It is also worth noting that spatial\nphase coherence can be naturally attained from the spatial\ncoherence of the laser, suggesting that microcavities could\nalso find application in phase array optics.\nAn important new functionality of polariton integrated\ncircuits may be achieved by taking advantage of the polar-\nization degree of freedom of exciton-polaritons.20 The polar-\nization multistability \u0002i.e., coexistence of right-circularly,\nleft-circularly, and linearly polarized stable states12\u0003 makes\npossible the realization of schemes with encoding above bi-\nnary logic. A theoretical proposal for all-optical polariton\npolarization switches8 has been recently demonstrated\nexperimentally.14\nIn conclusion, until recently, semiconductor microcavities\nhave been considered almost exclusively for applications in\nsolid-state optical sources.6,21 However, now it is apparent\nthat they are extremely promising as the basis of devices\nwith applications in ultrafast information processing. Indeed,\nit is clear that we have only just begun to appreciate the\npotential of cavity plasmon\u2013exciton-polariton systems.\nT.L. was supported by NCCR-QP; A.V.K., M.K., R.A.A.\nacknowledge support from the EU \u201cPOLALAS\u201d project;\nI.A.S. acknowledges support from Rannis.\n1A.
