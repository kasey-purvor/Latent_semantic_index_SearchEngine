Two themes are pursued. \nFirst, recent work on neoliberal governmentality is useful for illuminating the \nforms of power and subtle mechanisms of influence which chracterize the IOM\u2019s \nattempt to managerialize border policies in countries as different as Ethiopia, \nSerbia and Armenia. Second, the international government of borders \ncomprises diverse and heterogeneous practices, ranging from the hosting of \ntraining seminars for local security and migration officials, to the promotion of \nschemes to purchase and install cutting-edge surveillance equipment. In such \ndifferent ways one can observe in very material terms how the project of making \nborders into a problem of \u2018management\u2019 conflicts with a perception of borders \nas a site of social struggle and politics. \n 2 \n \nFor some time now \u2018the border\u2019 has been absolutely central to the way in which we \nconceive globalization. Speaking very broadly it is possible to identify two distinct ways \nin which the theme of borders has operated within globalization narratives. In some of \nthe earlier attempts to map and theorize a set of processes and dynamics as \n\u2018globalization\u2019, the latter was typically equated with the proliferation and thickening of \nvarious kinds of cross-border flows and transnational linkages, the birth of new spaces \nlike \u2018global civil society\u2019 (Keane 2003), tendencies of time-space compression (Giddens \n1990), and even the imminent arrival of a \u2018borderless world\u2019 (Ohmae 1990). In this initial \nversion globalization was represented as an integrative and, in some versions, \ndeterritorializing phenomenon, a powerful force that would eventually make obsolete \nthe bordered space of an inter-national world. \nBut the discussion about borders within globalization debates has moved some way \nfrom this initial framing. One can now identify a second generation of research \u2013 what \nParker et al (Parker and Vaughn-Williams 2009) term \u2018critical border studies\u2019 - in which \na somewhat more skeptical but also more nuanced picture has coalesced.1\nWe share many of the concerns of these investigations of gated globalism, especially \ntheir sense that we are witnessing a redeployment and reactivation of borders under \nnew conditions. But in this paper we outline a somewhat different way in which the \nquestion of borders might be posed in relation to the question of the global. In the work \nwe have just mentioned, the connection is often posed in relation to an ontology of \n It is now \nmuch more common to understand globalization and bordering as processes which \nadvance hand in hand, a situation we might call \u2018gated globalism\u2019 - a term we borrow \nfrom Cunningham (2001: 382). Far from culminating in the erosion of borders, \nglobalization is seen to be accompanied by a diffusion, dispersal and networking of \nborders such that border functions and border effects are proliferating in proportion to \npolitical dynamics of fear, unease and insecurity, dynamics that are deemed by many to \nbe amongst the most immediate political repercussions of globalization (Coward 2005; \nsee also Andreas and Biersteker 2003). In some versions, border controls no longer \nreflect just the aggregate of each state\u2019s national policy, each regime protecting a \nnational territory. Superimposed upon this territorial regime, border controls now work \nlike a matrix, or a global regime, a grid spread across transnational spaces of \nproduction, communication and mobility (Shamir 2005). Increasingly they function as \nthe counterpart to a mobile, unequal world. They are, as such, immanent to global \nprocesses of production, mobility, and risk, and, as Rumford (2006) has suggested, not \nat the edge of society but internal to emergent transnational or even global social \nspaces. In this version borders appear less as contiguous lines on the political map and \nmore as zones, bands, intensities of control \u2013 and crucially, contestation. \n                                                 \n1For important surveys and review of this literature, see Amoore et al (2008); Newman (2006); Paasi \n(2009); Van Houtum et al (2005).  \n 3 \nsocioeconomic transformations. That is, scholars have sought to explain the character \nof borders substantively, by referring them to a set of more primary transformations - \nglobalization, transnationalization, network\/control society, risk society, and the like. \nWhile this move to place the theorization of borders and bordering in a wider context is \nimportant, it has overlooked something important. Somewhat neglected in this move is \nthe question of the place of borders within concrete schemes of regional, international \nand global governance. Our claim is that these important studies of gated globalism \nhave paid insufficient attention to the world of international programmes, schemes, \nand agencies, which now exists and which has made the government of borders into its \narea of expertise, often in a very technical way. The emergence of an entire specialist \ndomain wherein the design, policing, administration, legal and technical operation of \nborders has become a field of knowledge in its own right, coupled with a set of \nadministrative measures aimed at reshaping the control of borders, has gone largely \nunnoticed in much writing about borders.2\nLike the institutional practices associated with global governance more broadly, we \nargue that the international government of borders deserves to be understood as an \nirreducible domain, with its own dynamics, institutions, logics, personnel, methods and \npolitics. While processes of regionalization and globalization might provide its context, \nit is not to be understood as the mere reflection of these \u2018larger\u2019 phenomena. Instead, \nwe insist that the international government of borders deserves to be analyzed in its \nown right. That said, a proper mapping of the institutions and agencies currently \nengaged in the international government of borders is well beyond the scope of this \npaper. It would address not just the government of borders in relation to human \nmobility \u2013 which is our concern in this paper \u2013 but all those other agendas which \nconnect with the question of borders, including trade, socio-economic development in \nborder regions, cross-border policing, and much else besides. \n It is this phenomenon we are calling the \ninternational government of borders.  \nBut confining our attention just to human migration, it is manifestly clear that a \nplethora of agencies now specialize in advising, assisting and consulting national \ngovernments in diverse aspects of the management of their borders. For the \ninternational government of borders is a crowded, heterogeneous and sometimes \ndisputed field of expertise and intervention. It includes bodies like Frontex, which bills \n                                                 \n2 There are some significant exceptions here. The most notable is probably the theorization of the \ntransformation of border controls in Europe. One version of this is largely institution-focused and \nconcerned with decision-making, policy learning, and \u2018externalization\u2019 of the EU\u2019s migration, border and \nasylum policies (e.g., Geddes 2005; Lavenex and U\u00e7arer 2003). A second is more critical and more \nconcerned to understand what it often describes as the European \u2018border regime\u2019 in relation to historical \ntransformations in territoriality, citizenship and sovereign power (e.g., Anderson and Bigo 2003; \nMezzadra 2006; Papadopoulos, et al. 2008; Rigo 2005, 2007; Walters 2002b). This critical literature on the \ntransnational structures of border regimes in Europe overlaps with another body of work that, it should \nbe noted, now also emphasizes the need to conduct the analysis of power at the level of strategies, \ntechniques, programmes and agencies. This is the literature on the securitization of migration. See, inter \nalia, Didier Bigo (2008); Huysmans (2006) and Neal (2009).  \n 4 \nitself as \u2018an EU agency\u2026 created as a specialised and independent body tasked to \ncoordinate the operational cooperation between Member States in the field of border \nsecurity\u2019.3 It includes large corporations like Accenture that have made border \nmanagement into a commodified service to be marketed within a global economy.4\nThis paper will focus on one key agency within the international government of \nborders: the International Organization for Migration (IOM). Representing itself as \u2018the \nmigration agency\u2019, IOM today operates as a major source of intelligence, assessment, \nadvice and technical assistance in connection with national and regional border policies \nand practices. It does so in connection with a wider claim that it is helping to ensure \u2018the \norderly and humane management of migration\u2019 on a worldwide basis (IOM 2009).  \n It \nextends to the international agencies like the International Civil Aviation Organization \nthat develop and promote technical standards for passports and other systems of \nborder inspection (Stanton 2008). But it also includes humanitarian organizations like \nthe Jesuit Refugee Service and M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res. The more that border \ncrossing has become a dangerous and often lethal undertaking for many migrants and \nrefugees, the more humanitarian agencies have found themselves drawn into the \npastoral management of borders - whether by exercising a critical watch over the \ndetention complexes that are now a common feature of the border systems, or \nproviding humanitarian assistance to migrants at coastlines, in deserts, and at sea, and \nwherever else migrants make their risky and desperate bids to circumvent the global \nborder regime (Albahari 2006; Walters forthcoming). \nThe IOM was founded in 1951, the same year as the United Nations High Commissioner \nfor Refugees (UNHCR). Initially called Provisional Intergovermental Committee for the \nMovement of Migrants from Europe, it was the product of a Belgian and US initiative \n(Bojcun 2005: 6). However, unlike UNHCR, IOM was based on economic rather than \nhumanitarian principles. As Morris (2004: 43) explains, whereas \u2018UNHCR derives its \nmandate from international law and agreements\u2019, IOM is \u2018a membership organization, \nnot a UN agency\u2019. Nevertheless, it has grown quite significantly in recent years. It now \nboasts a total of 127 member states, and a programme budget for 2008 which exceeds \nUS$1 billion. This sum funds nearly 7000 staff serving in more than 450 field offices in \nmore than one hundred countries. It now operates in four main areas of what it calls \n\u2018migration management\u2019: migration and development, facilitating migration, \nregulating migration, and addressing forced migration (IOM 2009: 1).  \nWhile significant in terms of its scale, IOM\u2019s expansion within the field of international \nborders, migrants and refugee policy has not been without controversy, in particular as \n                                                 \n3 http:\/\/www.frontex.europa.eu ; accessed 4\/12\/09. \n4 Accenture advertise \u2018an integrated approach to border management that spans all agencies with border \nsecurity, customs and immigration responsibilities\u2019. See \nhttp:\/\/www.accenture.com\/Global\/Services\/By_Industry\/Government_and_Public_Service\/Border_Mana\ngement\/default.htm ; accessed 4\/12\/09. \n 5 \nIOM describes key aspects of its activities using the language of humanitarian \nassistance (Morris 2004). This has troubled some of the agencies with a longstanding \nassociation with humanitarianism, who point out that not only does IOM lack the \nproper mandate to act in this area, it has engaged in activities which actually violate the \nhuman rights of migrants. These range from its participation in the asylum \ndetermination process \u2018imposed\u2019 on Haitian asylum seekers (HRW 2003: 1) to its \nfacilitation of the deportation of Burmese migrant workers in Thailand (Morris 2004: \n43). IOM\u2019s involvement in the management of state borders would appear to be \nunsettling the borders of the humanitarian complex. \nDespite the fact that it has become a major operator in the field of international \nborders and migration governance, there is surprisingly very little academic research \nthat has interrogated this agency.5\nWe develop two arguments about the IOM and, indirectly, the international \ngovernment of borders. The first of these concerns the most appropriate way to \ntheorize this phenomenon and assess its political logic. Specifically, we argue that \nalthough concepts like empire are undoubtedly useful in offering a larger narrative in \nwhich to place these questions, key insights can be gained by drawing on recent work \non the theme of international neoliberalism and global governmentality (Chandler \n2006; Hindess 2005a; Larner and Walters 2004; Ong and Collier 2005). This line of \nanalysis depicts global governance less as a project of creating an entirely new regime \nof power operating on a global level somewhere \u2018above\u2019 the world of states, and much \nmore as a complex of schemes which govern through the elicitation of state agency and \nthe regulated enhancement and deployment of state capacity. This move has several \ntheoretical benefits, not the least of which is to specify what is novel about \ncontemporary regimes and programmes of international order.  \n Migration scholars routinely use IOM material as \ndata, and often participate in its research and its policy programmes. But rarely has it \nbeen the subject of critical scrutiny itself. One argument of this paper is that it is high \ntime that the IOM were made an object of inquiry in its own right. As a contribution to \nthis task, this paper focuses on the IOM\u2019s involvement in the international government \nof borders. \nSecond, we argue that the field of activities and programmes of agencies like the IOM \nshould be taken much more seriously and regarded as a sphere meriting careful \nempirical study. While it may appear as a rather dull space of technical concepts and \nmanagerial practices, a more nuanced understanding of the international government \nof borders requires us to carefully interrogate these practices. These should be studied \nnot primarily as a matter of offering a more fine grained analysis of a bigger process. \nRather, a close reading of practices like \u2018border management\u2019, \u2018assisted voluntary \n                                                 \n5 A notable exception is Duvell (2002) whom we discuss below. The activities and politics of the IOM has \nbeen extensively discussed, sometimes quite polemically, within activist networks. In particular, see \n<http:\/\/www.noborder.org\/iom\/index.php>. For an official history of the IOM see Ducasse-Rogier (2001). \n 6 \nreturn\u2019 and \u2018capacity building\u2019 offers important insights about the ethos and rationality \nof international government. It brings into focus that this is a terrain comprising \nmultiple power relations, tactics and maneuvers. It develops the point that this is not a \nsystem which works by coercion or discipline alone but, as numerous studies of \ncontemporary governmentality (e.g., Rose 1999) have stressed, through the calculated \nconstruction of states and other collectivities as subjects who bear an ability and a \nresponsibility to shape their futures by making informed and strategic choices.  \nTwo versions of neoliberalism \nWhereas specific border sites like the land crossing (Sparke 2004), the seaport (Chalfin \n2006) and the airport (Salter 2007) have been examined in some depth, and while, as \nwe noted above, there has been much discussion of the globalization of border controls \nand a new global regime of mobility control, there has been relatively little \ninvestigation of those international agencies and programmes whose business it is to \npromote standards, regulate and communicate norms about border control. \nCorrespondingly, the activity of the IOM, possibly the main actor in this respect, has \ngone largely unnoticed. However, there are exceptions to this rule. Perhaps the most \nnotable is D\u00fcvell\u2019s investigation of the IOM, which he frames in terms of the \nglobalization of migration control (D\u00fcvell 2003). D\u00fcvell astutely observes that recent \nyears have seen a range of transnational migration agencies rise to prominence. Their \nadvance has gone hand in hand with recognition on the part of policymakers and \nexperts that new concepts, programmes, scales and frameworks for migration policy \nare necessary in the face of the \u2018challenge\u2019 of globalization. Rebranding itself as a \n\u2018global\u2019 organization, and operating within a division of regulatory labour alongside \nagencies devoted to the humanitarian (e.g., UNHCR) and the securitarian (e.g., \nInternational Centre for Migration Policy Development), IOM is a key element within \nthis transnational regime.  \nD\u00fcvell\u2019s discussion of the IOM is helpful in a number of ways. First, he conveys a sense \nof the broad array of activities which now fall under IOM\u2019s remit. These range from \noffering advice and technical assistance to national governments in implementing \ndetention centres and the development of campaigns to \u2018combat\u2019 trafficking of women, \nto quite specific activities like the compensation of non-Jewish victims of Nazism\u2019s \nslave labour programmes.6\n                                                 \n6 For a detailed analysis on IOM\u2019s counter trafficking campaigns in various countries of Eastern Europe \nsee Andrijasevic (2007). \n In this paper we are interested in one aspect of IOM\u2019s \nactivities and programmes: how they are making borders into a space of expert \nknowledge and international policy. As we will show in the following section, this is \ndone under the rubric of advancing an \u2018integrated\u2019 or \u2018comprehensive\u2019 approach to \nmigration control.  Within this larger framework, border management is one \ncomponent - albeit a central one \u2013 of a wider set of measures that have come to be \nassociated with the idea of \u2018migration management\u2019. Second, D\u00fcvell\u2019s take on IOM is \n 7 \nsignificant as it challenges the technocratic self-representation of the IOM. For \nexample, he observes how the often grubby and sometimes violent activity of \ndeporting people is represented within the IOM\u2019s discourse in the irenic language of \n\u2018assisted voluntary return\u2019.  \nThird, and it is this point we wish to emphasize, D\u00fcvell\u2019s account is important because \nhe insists on the need to understand discourses of migration and border management - \ncontrary to their appeal to a self-evident commonsense (e.g., who would disagree that \ncomplicated and risky things should be managed) \u2013 as emblematic of very particular \nmodes of normalization. This is not a term D\u00fcvell uses himself, but we think it is implicit \nin the way he interprets the IOM\u2019s agenda for migration. As D\u00fcvell sees it, the IOM is \nnot in the business of opposing all migration, as certain nationalist and protectionist \nmovements might be. Instead, it calls for migration to be regulated, shaped, and \nharnessed. \u2018Such a strategy [\u2026] aims to distinguish between the productive and the \nunproductive elements of migration movements and turn the former into a driving \nforce of economic growth\u2019 (2003). In this way D\u00fcvell enjoins us to see IOM as an agency \noriented to the rationalization of the migration policies of those countries that find \nthemselves situated for the most part outside the blocs of the world\u2019s richest states. Its \nmain goal, as he sees it, is to align the migration policies of regions like West Africa and \nSouth America with the migration control norms and aspirations of the global North. In \nshaping the migration control strategies of these \u2018third countries\u2019 and regions, IOM \nconcerns itself with the difficult task of sorting mobile populations into streams of the \nuseful and useless, admissible and returnable, employable and deportable. In this way \nIOM\u2019s work could be understood as an element within projects to consolidate a global \nhierarchy of mobility and new arrangements of labour that correspond in broad outline \nwith the image of flexible capitalism. \nWhile we agree with the broad thrust of D\u00fcvell\u2019s analysis, our argument here is that it \ncan be further sharpened in at least one direction. It can be honed, we argue, by \nconnecting it to recent advances in the theorization of international neoliberalism. \nMore specifically, we think that the analysis of the international government of borders \ncan be fruitfully brought into a dialogue with a line of analysis first opened by Foucault\u2019s \n(2007; 2008) lectures on the history of governmentality and neoliberalism, and recently \ndeveloped in the context of the government of states by Hindess (2002; 2005a; 2005b) \nand others (e.g., Dean 2007).  \nAt this point it might be useful to ask how the Foucauldian perspective on neoliberalism \nmight differ from the account that is more commonly found within the tradition of \ncritical and Marxist political economy? While it would be unhelpful to overstate their \ndifferences \u2013 indeed, it would be more profitable to examine whether their insights \nmight be combined more fruitfully7\n                                                 \n7 For a comparison of Foucauldian and Marxist approaches to neoliberalism see Larner (2000)  \n -  it could certainly be said that the Foucauldian \naccount concentrates largely on analyzing neoliberalism as a new ethos of rule. Critical \n 8 \npolitical economy has interpreted neoliberalism as a highly-contradictory project to \nrevitalize a certain model of unfettered market capitalism, coupled with a more or less \ncoordinated program aiming at the economic and cultural (re-)empowerment of \nmanagerial, financial and entrepreneurial elites and class fractions.8\nThe Foucauldian account of neoliberalism sensitizes us therefore to the complex \nworkings of power within and beyond the state. In the case of our analysis this is a point \nabout the particular modes of power which transnational agencies of migration \ngovernance bring into play. We will briefly mention it here before returning at length in \nthe following section. As Hindess notes, neoliberalism is often characterized as a \ndisciplinary and coercive enterprise that weighs down upon subject peoples and states, \nimposing the logic of corporate capitalism upon them. Yet to characterize it in such \nterms is somewhat misleading. \n By comparison, the \nFoucauldian perspective has sought to understand neoliberalism in terms of certain \npolitical arts, strategies and technologies capable of remaking governance and \nsubjectivity not just across the sectors of the state, but social, cultural and economic life \nmore broadly (Lemke 2001; Rose 1999).  The essence of this rationality is its search for \nmechanisms which elicit, produce and generalize choice-making subjectivities and \nenterprising modes of conduct, and which embed such subjectivities within a host of \ncalculative and administrative practices, including performance indicators, new forms \nof auditing and accounting, and other techniques for devolving and reshaping \nresponsibilities across bureaucracies, firms, welfare offices, charities and much else. On \nthis reading there is much more to neoliberalism than merely the negative move of \nderegulating social and economic sectors, the strategic use of the state to activate \nsociety, or the ideological celebration of the market.  \n\u2018Programmes of social reform seldom operate solely through coercive means\u2026. [L]ike \nits older siblings\u2026 [neoliberalism] prefers to work through the freely chosen actions of \nstates and other agents, and it is promoted by a variety of state and non-state actors\u2026 \nIt also relies on agencies\u2026 which have no coercive powers of their own and which \noperate rather through persuasion and example, suggesting to activists, states and \nother agencies ways in which they might address their concerns and insisting, most \nparticularly, on the role of civil society, the private sector, NGOs and international \nagencies\u2019 (Hindess 2005b: 1397). \nIf neoliberal rule has achieved a certain durability and hegemony domestically, it is \nbecause of its ability to connect with the profusion of mechanisms located at some \ndistance from the state which foster, and sometimes compel new modes of individual \nand collective responsibility. These range from the advent of an intricate (and now \ncrisis-ridden) field of personal finance, to the burgeoning markets of self-help and self-\nanalysis, and their accompanying industries of therapeutic expertise. In these and many \nother ways, neoliberalism has advanced not just as a grand project of globalization and \n                                                 \n8 Amongst the best work in this tradition, see Gill (2003) and Harvey (2005). \n 9 \nfinancialization, but through countless small, molecular and only partially coordinated \ntransformations in the management and self-management of everyday life. \nIn a recent series of papers Hindess has extended certain of these Foucauldian insights \nto think about neoliberalism not just as a mode of governing domestic societies but as \nan art of international government (Hindess 2002; 2005a; 2005b). Central to this \nneoliberal art of international government is the fact of a fundamental reorientation of \ninternational authority in its relationship between the metropolitan powers and the \ncountries and peoples who were formerly its imperial subjects. If domestically \nneoliberalism can be said to govern by constructing responsible individuals and \nenmeshing them in games of self-governance, international neoliberalism finds its \ncorrelate in a formally post-imperial world order, that is, one populated by legally \nindependent states: \u2018[F]ar from promoting a deterritorialized apparatus of rule, as \nHardt and Negri suggest, the emerging global order in fact relies upon the capacity of \nterritorial states to govern their own populations. The promotion of democracy, good \ngovernance, and human rights by international development agencies and financial \ninstitutions is designed to further reinforce these capacities\u2019 (2005a: 256).  \nThis observation that a great deal of the work of international agencies today is \noriented not to the dismantling of state power but towards establishing the viability of \ncertain forms of statehood, and cultivating a regulated form of state sovereignty, could \ncertainly be read alongside other critical work about \u2018conditional sovereignty\u2019. For \nexample, in his work on development and humanitarian aid practices, Duffield (2001) \nshows how donor governments and multilateral agencies alike treat the sovereignty of \nweaker or contested states in the unstable zones of the world system (which he refers \nto as \u2018borderlands\u2019) as a conditional status. This conditional sovereignty is contingent \nupon the internationalization of public policy, the achievement of social, economic, and \npolitical stability via public-private contractual networks and the growing involvement \nof non-state actors. Metropolitan governments are reluctant to intervene directly in the \ninternal affairs of third countries. Instead the governing of these troubled zones takes \nplace though sectorally-specific interventions implemented by non-state and private \norganizations within the framework where security is redefined as a problem of \ndevelopment (2001: 311-312). This line of analysis makes a great deal of sense when \napplied to the case of the IOM. With the IOM we are faced with a concerted attempt to \ngeneralize a particular model of statehood within the domain of migration politics. \nEmbedded in IOM programmes are a whole set of norms and best practices concerning \nthe appropriate organization of borders; the imperative and best methods for \nidentifying and distinguishing between the citizen and the non-citizen, and the resident \nand the illegal; the most effective ways of removing non-citizen and unwanted \npopulations form a state\u2019s territory, and much else besides.  \nThere may well be strong continuities between what D\u00fcvell calls \u2018classical imperialism\u2019, \nand the way in which the major states today use a combination of economic, political, \nfinancial and even military inducements to win the active participation of countries like \n 10 \nLibya, Morocco and Mexico in their migration control strategies. Nevertheless, our \npoint will be that the IOM\u2019s mode of operation is distinctly neoliberal \u2013 and, crucially, \npost-imperial - in at least one important respect. If it becomes involved in the \ngovernance of borders in the global borderlands, this encounter takes the form of a \nregulated choice not an imposition. It is patterned as a situation in which IOM methods \nand norms are not imposed but \u2018learnt\u2019 in contexts such as seminars and field-trips \nwhere the IOM\u2019s expertise has been invited. Just as neoliberalism governs at the level of \nsociety through a game in which citizens will work upon themselves to become fitter, \nhappier and more competitive under the tutelage of relevant forms of expertise, then \nso will the IOM intervene in the international government of borders as a \u2018partner\u2019 and a \n\u2018consultant\u2019 assisting states who, for various reasons, express a will to get their own \nborders in order, as it were. Ultimately, our point is not to treat the imperial and the \npost-imperial as mutually exclusive concepts. Some \u2018choices\u2019 made by governments in \nthe global South are going to be more \u2018voluntary\u2019 than others. But it is important to \nnote the extent to which international government today operates and is legitimated \nnot by direct coersion but by its elicitation of the active involvement of the states of the \nglobal South.  \nThe \u2019problem\u2019 of borders \nExtending the Foucauldian idea of government as a complexly layered and \nheterogeneous activity involving the \u2018conduct of conduct\u2019, Michael Merlingen has \nargued persuasively that the work of international governmental organizations (IGOs) \ncan be fruitfully understood as the \u2018international conduct of the conduct of countries\u2019 \n(Merlingen 2003: 367). This captures nicely the way in which many IGOs engage in \nstrategies of control which work not in a direct sense, imposing their will on those \nregions of the world designated as \u2018developing countries\u2019. Instead these strategies \noperate by shaping the discursive environment within which particular states pose the \nproblem of how to govern specific issues, and the means they might use to pursue \ngovernmental objectives.9\nAs a first task, any attempt to understand the IOM\u2019s role in the international \ngovernment of borders, and its agency in the normalization of the conduct of border \ncontrol would do well to ask this question: How is the IOM responsible for producing a \nspecific discourse about borders, and how does this cast the border as a particular \nterrain of expert intervention? The point is that history reveals a great degree of \nvariation in the way in which borders have been deemed problematic. So, to put it \n Central to this activity of the international conduct of the \nconduct of countries is the labour which IGOs undertake to \u2018objectify reality into a \nterrain to be governed, i.e., how they discursively constitute phenomena as problems \nwhose solution requires international interventions\u2019 (367-8). \n                                                 \n9 This point about the power of language and expertise has, of course, been made at length by critical \nstudies of the discourse and apparatus of development, and the role played by IGOs and social scientists \nwithin its networks. See, inter alia, Escobar (1995), Ferguson (2006) and Mitchell (2002).  \n 11 \ndifferently, how does the IOM pose the border as a problem? For the IOM the border is \nnot a question of balancing the competing territorial claims of states, and interests of \nthe major powers, as it was for diplomats and statespersons overseeing Europe\u2019s \n\u2018military-diplomatic\u2019 technology of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (Foucault \n2007: 296). Nor is the border a means for aligning the racially- and ethnically-coded \nmap of population with the space of territory and sovereignty, as it was for many of the \nexperts engaged in the kinds of discussions that framed the Paris Peace Conference of \n1919 (Crampton 2007).  \nThe problem of borders as understood by the IOM is of a somewhat different order, for \nit is much closer to a discourse in which borders are regarded not as geo-military \ninstruments within games of statecraft, or lines that are to express a particular division \nof the earth amongst its peoples but instead as privileged mechanisms within the \npolicing of global movements and fluid processes. The IOM operates on a discursive \nterrain where borders are not so much concerned with the containment of population \nand territory as they are regulating the terms on which global processes will play \nthemselves out within a world which, for all its apparent flux and fluidity, remains \nsegmented juridically and politically into national spaces. This does not mean that \nthemes of \u2018defending\u2019 territory and society from migratory \u2018invasion\u2019 do not continue to \nanimate the political scene in which the IOM intervenes. Nor is it to overlook the \npersistence of practices whereby the border does feature prominently as a defensive \nwall, or an instrument of territorial acquisition.10\nThis is the overall context which defines the kind of \u2018problem\u2019 of borders which the IOM \nspeaks to. But the IOM does not simply reproduce a more general discursive and \npolitical economy of borders. Instead, we want to insist that it plays a constructive and \nconstitutive role, making important interventions which actually shape and define the \nway in which states, through their national experts, policymakers, border guards , etc, \nunderstand the \u2018problem\u2019 of borders. To clarify this point we need to attend to the \nspecific terms and frameworks which the IOM uses to represent the question of \nborders. Here we want to begin by observing that a great deal of the IOM\u2019s reflection \nand prescription regarding borders is conducted under the heading of \u2018border \n But it is to say that, however \npolemically potent the image of \u2018Fortress Europe\u2019 or \u2018Fortress America\u2019 might be, it \nrather misses the point that the contemporary ordering of borders is much closer to a \nspace of nodes and networks, of gateways, filters and passage points, than it is to the \nold idea of borders as defensive lines. \n                                                 \n10 Both the fact of the persistence of borders as defensive apparatuses and instruments for territorial \nappropriation, and that there has been considerable innovation in these practices, is confirmed by \nWeizman\u2019s (2007) study of the ongoing rebordering of the West Bank. Like other recent discussions of \nthe return of walled and fenced frontiers (e.g., Newman 2009), Weizman\u2019s work reminds us that the \ngovernment of borders is not confined to border crossing points, whether at airports, seaports or on land. \nThere is also the matter of how long stretches of frontier on land and sea are to be controlled. This is not \na question we have addressed here, though it would be interesting to know whether the design, building \nand management of border-walls is also now a space of international expertise and activity. \n 12 \nmanagement\u2019, a concept that is in turn closely related to the idea of \u2018migration \nmanagement\u2019.  \nThe IOM insists that effective border management is integral to the wider aim of \nmigration management. As such, it calls for states to adopt, develop and improve what \nit calls \u2018border management systems\u2019. The aim of such systems, we are told, is twofold. \nOn the one hand they must \u2018facilitate bona fida travellers, providing a welcoming and \nefficient gateway to the state\u2019. At the same time, they must \u2018provide a barrier and \ndisincentive to entry for those seeking to circumvent migration laws\u2019.11 It is this difficult \ntask of reconciling principles of efficiency, mobility and speed, with a particular vision of \nsecurity and control that lies at the heart of this problem of border management. It is a \ntask which seems to constitute the problem of the border as a zone of experimentation \nand innovation in technologies of government. Many of these experiments in \ngovernance look to cutting edge technoscience to mediate the problem of the border.12\nIt is this heterogeneous domain of social interventions that most interests us in this \npaper and we return to it shortly. But first it is necessary to make some further brief \ncomments on the idea of border management. For the point here is that, however \ncommonsensical it may sound \u2013 i.e., the implicit claim that good borders are well-\nmanaged borders \u2013 it is far from self-evident or inevitable that the question of the \norganization of borders should be framed as one of \u2018management\u2019. As such, there is a \nneed to unpack the idea of border management. We have three points to make. \n \nBut we should not overlook the countless and varied social technologies that play an \nintegral yet largely unexamined role in the international government of borders. It is \nthrough such ordinary practices as the distribution of handbooks to local police \nofficials, training seminars for border inspectors, study visits for immigration officials, \neven the hosting of lunches that are to cultivate a certain familiarity between border \nexperts and their international (and usually western) counterparts, that an agency like \nIOM endeavours to shape the way border control is conducted in particular problematic \ncountries and regions. \nFirst, the idea of border management entails a somewhat new imagination of the \ngovernmental space of borders. Here we want to emphasize that the IOM speaks of \nborders as though they occupy a space modelled in the image of the cybernetic. \nBorders are now imagined as instruments which operate in the context of multiple \n\u2018interconnected subsystems\u2019. This would seem to be a heterogeneous domain since it \nincludes trained personnel, an audit capability, interagency and international \n                                                 \n11 IOM, \u2018Border management systems\u2019, http:\/\/www.iom.int\/jahia\/Jahia\/pid\/279 \n12 For example, see the recent literature on the application of \u2018biometrics\u2019 to border control. Biometrics \nhas quickly emerged as a multibillion dollar technology market offering high-tech solutions to countless \ndifferent securitized contexts, ranging from voter registration in \u2018\u2019emerging\u2019 democracies to the policing \nof national borders. Some of the most insightful work includes Amoore (2006), Sparke (2004), and van \nder Ploeg (2006). For a critical discussion of the idea of technology as a \u2018fix\u2019 for security see Bigo and \nCarrera (2005) \n 13 \ncooperation, and strategic partnerships with carriers and industry.13 Technological \ncapacities, such as the means to issue, regulate and process machine-readable \npassports and visas are part of this management system. But so are legal and \nbureaucratic elements such as a framework for migration policy though which IOM \n\u2018assists\u2019 states to put in place a national policy framework which defines migration laws \nand sets out entry, stay and removal regulations. As IOM succinctly puts it: \u2018The \neffectiveness of the border management system is \u2026 significantly affected by the rules \nand processes chosen to enforce the conditions under which entry is permitted, \nincluding commitment to locating and removing those who breach the conditions of \ntheir stay\u2019.14\nSecond, the idea of a border management system encompasses a certain practice of \nreflexivity. IOM insists that well-managed borders are those that  generate data which \nin turn is to be used by national agencies to monitor their own performance and also by \ninternational agencies. This flow of quantitative data, subsequently managed and \noptimized, is generated via a multifaceted control of borders. This gives rise to what we \ncall a managerialization of borders in the sense that the border system is engineered as \nsomething that has a capacity for constant and ongoing self-monitoring. It is even \nperhaps possible to speak of metagovernance of borders given IOM\u2019s efforts to create \nand set in place a so-called \u2018General Model\u2019 for the \u2018creation, collection, application and \nsharing of migration related data\u2019 among Eastern Europe and Central Asian countries.\n  \n15\nSeen in this light, border management is not merely a matter of border guards being \ntasked with controlling the flows of people and things that traverse the frontier, \ndiscriminating between the bona fide and the bogus. Nor is it just a matter of managing \nthe tensions between a commitment to human rights, commerce and security. It is, in \naddition, and as a means to accomplish these ends, a matter of managing the condition \nof, and the interrelationships between a host of different domains. This activity is made \nall the more complex once it is recognized that IOM sees the commitment to effective \n\u2018pre-frontier strategies\u2019 as an integral element of border management. These strategies \ninvolve a certain dispersal of control functions away from the usual border settings and \ntheir re-locating at points of embarkation. The strategies also include harmonization of \nvisa and passports to the international standards via biometrics and machine-readable \ntravel documents; \u2018passenger pre-inspection\u2019 at points of embarkation so as to identify \nfraudulent documents and prevent onward unauthorized travel; and carrier sanctions in \norder to make carriers accountable for embarking and transporting undocumented \nmigrants.\n    \n16\n                                                 \n13 \n \nhttp:\/\/www.iom.int\/jahia\/Jahia\/pid\/279 \n14 http:\/\/www.iom.int\/jahia\/Jahia\/pid\/597  \n15 http:\/\/www.tcc.iom.int\/iom\/artikel.php?menu_id=42 \n16 http:\/\/www.iom.int\/jahia\/Jahia\/pid\/599  \n 14 \nFinally, the constitution of borders as a problem of management goes hand in hand \nwith the emergence of new forms of authority and expertise. In short, management \naffirms a more pronounced role for managers and managerial styles of reasoning. The \ntendency towards managerialism within national and international contexts of public \nadministration has been extensively documented (Parker 2002; Power 1994; Rose \n1996). The extension of managerialism  into public health sectors, welfare regimes, \ntransportation systems, etc, has meant that the substantive expertise of doctors, \neducators, social workers and other professions has been confronted with the more \nformal expertise associated with accountancy, auditing, finance, marketing and \nmanagement \u2013 what Rose aptly terms the \u2018grey sciences\u2019. Quite often the social \nprofessions find themselves enmeshed in managerialist grids of calculability. While we \nlack the space to explore the point here, there may be good grounds for applying a \nsimilar analysis to the governance of borders. Let us just say that the border has always \nbeen a crowded place, crowded not just because travellers gather there, but also \nbecause a host of other experts and authorities have a stake \u2013 intelligence officers, \nmilitary strategists, police authorities, customs and immigration officials, geographers, \nhygienists, and so on. Under the auspices of \u2018border management\u2019 it now becomes all \nthe more crowded. The  work of agencies like IOM adds a new layer of expertise to the \nvarious specialisms which have long been a feature of the machinery of bordering. This \nnew layer operates transversally and transnationally, assessing, recalibrating, and \nintegrating the existing and new practices.  \nStandards, norms, capacities \nA significant body of research has explored how technical norms have come to play an \nintegral role in the constitution and governance of transnational zones and global \nspaces (Barry 2006; Larner and Le Heron 2004). It is quite evident that we cannot fully \ngrasp the decentred style of neoliberal governance on a global scale without \nconsidering the constitutive work of technical norms, standards and regulations.  \nParticular attention has been paid to standards concerning the movement of goods and \nmaterials, especially in the constitution of European space (Chalfin 2006; Dunn 2005). \nBut with the IOM we see how the cross-border mobility, but also the im-mobility of \nhuman subjects, also becomes subject to governance by and through technical norms. \nHere IOM works as a mediator, communicating norms and standards that in some \ncases it has formulated itself,17\n                                                 \n17 For example, see the three volume publication Essentials of Migration Management (EMM) (IOM \n2004b). Designed to \u2018expand the knowledge and facilitate the work of government policy makers, \npractitioners, academics, organizations as well as IOM staff members\u2019, and comprising \u2018learning \nobjectives, case studies, [and] a guide to applying the subject matter to specific situations\u2019, this text is \nclearly much more than just a publication. In typical \u2018managementspeak\u2019, IOM describes this as a \n\u2018learning tool\u2019 (IOM 2005). The claim is supported by the fact that EMM itself circulates within particular \ninternational networks of expertise. Indeed, EMM has its own dedicated newsletter which hints at the \nglobal geography of IOM\u2019s border-related pedagogy. From Tirana to Tehran, and from Brussels to \nBangkok, seminars and workshops are taking place which accord the EMM a central place in their \nactivity. Reading the newsletter one gets the feint suggestion of a religious mission to spread the Word, \n or in other instances, norms and standards specific to \n 15 \nother programmes and agencies (e.g., International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) \nwhich is the principal authority on standards for passports (Stanton 2008).  \nWhat place do technical norms have in the international government of borders? It \nwould certainly be useful to examine how technical norms relating to the management \nof borders get formulated.18\nDuring June 2007 the IOM\u2019s Special Liaison Mission in Addis Ababa staged a three day \nworkshop dedicated to \u2018capacity-building training in migration and border \nmanagement\u2019. The event was directed primarily towards Ethiopian immigration and \nintelligence officers. The framing of the announcement for the seminar is quite \ninstructive and speaks nicely to the political rationality at work within the international \ngovernment of borders. Let us quote it at length: \n Here one could follow the lead of scholars of \ntechnopolitics, and explore the micropolitical contests and controversies which play out \nwithin and between institutions and experts engaged in the formulation of technical \nnorms (e.g., Hecht 1998; 2006; on the case of the \u2018e-passport\u2019 see Stanton 2008). But \nhere we insist it is equally important to consider how technical norms are \ncommunicated and promoted in particular local contexts. Consider the following short \ncase.  \n\u2018The training\u2026 aims to build and address existing or identified gaps in the institutional \ncapacities of Ethiopian border and immigration authorities to effectively manage \nmigration, including passport and visa systems, fraudulent document detection, \nimpostor recognition and intelligence profiling as well as the use of biometrics in \nmigration management. IOM experts conducting the training will familiarize \nparticipants with new migration management learning tools and standards developed \nby the international community, including the IOM curriculum on Essentials of \nMigration Management (EMM), the International Agenda for Migration Managements \n(IAMM) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards\u2019 (IOM 2007). \nThis is, of course, only one of many training events and workshops which the IOM hosts \nor partners as it pursues its worldwide mission. Observing these practices from the \n                                                                                                                                                 \nespecially the enthusiastic reporting of each new initiative to translate the EMM, or relevant sections, \ninto the local language. For instance, we are told that at a recent meeting of the Bangladesh Migration \nand Development Forum, \u2018Interest was expressed in translating portions of the EMM into Bengali\u2019. \nLikewise, IOM\u2019s Tehran office is considering the translation of EMM into Farsi to improve its accessibility \nto policymakers and practitioners (IOM 2005).   \n18 While we can\u2019t enter into the question of the making of technical norms here, certain insights as to \ntheir form and content are offered by even a brief reading of the EMM. One of the striking features of this \ndocument is the fact that, much in the way of any typical textbook, it is structured to foster various self-\nproblematizing activities in its audience \u2013 in this instance the border and migration officials of various \nstates. For example, under the chapter dedicated to \u2018border management systems\u2019 it asks: \u2018what are the \nland and sea boundaries that your state is responsible for?\u2019 (IOM 2004b: 8) and \u2018Is there a sufficient flow \nand exchange of information between the various authorities involved in border management?\u2019 (IOM \n2004b: 5). \n 16 \noutside - that is, at the level of their promotional material and agendas - is obviously \nlimited. It tells us nothing about the social milieu of the workshop. For instance, it \nwould be interesting to know how the Ethiopian officials in question themselves \nnegotiated the event. Clearly, further studies in the international government of \nborders will benefit if researchers can undertake detailed, ethnographic investigations \ninto sites and practices like these training seminars.19\nYet there are still insights about the management of borders we can glean from this \ncase. First, notice how this exercise works on and around an existing regime which is \ndepicted as a set of \u2018institutional capacities\u2019. In a move which we might read as \nexemplary of the international government of government, it does not seek to govern \nmigration flows from scratch or directly. Instead, it engages with a given institutional \nregime but does so in a way that seeks to reshape it, augmenting certain aspects, \nidentifying \u2018gaps\u2019 elsewhere.  \n  \nSecond, there is the matter of what the IOM calls \u2018capacity-building\u2019. This returns us to \nthe issue we flagged in our introduction: the central role which regulated choice and \nstructured consent plays within the international government of borders. Capacity-\nbuilding frames governance not as an external imposition but as a relationship in which \ntarget states are helped to improve their own situation. Governance proceeds with the \nassumption that a will to improve ones capacity exists as a desire that is immanent to \nthe state in question. As the head of IOM\u2019s Division on Technical Cooperation sector \nputs it: \u2018One of IOM\u2019s core responsibilities is that of assisting our Members and \nObservers, and at times other States, in developing their capacity to manage migration\u2019 \n(Harns 2004). As it could be observed, the aim of IOM\u2019s capacity building programmes \nis to complement and enhance national, bilateral and multilateral cooperation among \ngovernments. These programmes \u2013 which include project design, implementation, \ndevelopment of national strategies, and assistance to governments to undertake \nlegislative reforms - are shaped as partnerships between IOM, governments, and other \npartners and funders and work to define needs, priorities and interventions in matters \nof migration.  \nHere international government can be analyzed along two axes. The first is the axis of \nfacilitation and capacitation. This may include schemes like the Addis Ababa workshop \ndiscussed above - hosted by the IOM but funded by the British Embassy in Ethiopia. \nThe workshop was later to be followed by a \u2018study tour\u2019 to the United Kingdom, \nconceived in terms of an opportunity for Ethiopian officials to become acquainted with \n                                                 \n19 For some fascinating observations about one such event, see the field notes of a Noborders activist \nwho gained access to a small IOM conference on \u2018assisted voluntary return\u2019 in Birmingham, UK. For \ninstance, the activist notes that the IOM official running the conference addressed his audience like a \u2018PR \nexpert\u2019. This was apparently consistent with the fact that the IOM official was previously employed as a \npublicity manager for the British department store, John Lewis, and had also worked as a managing \ndirector of Euro Eddy\u2019s Family Fun Centre, a giant indoor playground for children in Leipzig, Germany! \nSee \u2018Inside the IOM Birmingham Conference\u2019, at www.indymedia.org.uk\/en\/2008\/07\/403079.html. \n 17 \ncutting edge social practices and technologies and, no doubt, forge informal ties with \nBritish and other policing networks.  \n \nIn a similar vein one sees the IOM sponsoring pilot programmes or raising interest and \nfunds from the international community in order to promote particular border projects. \nIn this area IOM reveals another aspect of neoliberal governance: it acts like an \nentrepreneur, identifying opportunities for security projects, then bringing together \nNGOs, states, experts and private companies to forge networks of support and \nimplementation. One example of these practices comes from the biometrics market. In \nArmenia, the IOM office in Yerevan has been running a Border Management \nInternational System (BMIS) Programme.20  This targeted Bagratashen, Armenia\u2019s \nmost important land border with Georgia. The aim of the project was to set in place a \nnetwork to link all ports of entry into one comprehensive information system. The \nproject was funded by the USA Embassy through its International Narcotics and Law \nEnforcement Programme and implemented in partnership with the AVIAINFOTEL \ngroup, experts on \u2018Total Airport Management Information System\u2019.21\n \n  We say more \nabout forms of facilitation and partnering below. \nThe second axis is one that we might call normative or peer pressure. In a document \ndedicated to the question of passports and visas the IOM assumes a voice that is \nsomewhat more authoritative and pedagogical than in the entrepreneurial narrative. It \nobserves sternly that \u2018Your State\u2019s passports, travel documents, and visas are \nimportant to how your State is perceived in the international community. By making \nthese documents highly secure, your State contributes to the fight against international \ncrime and terrorism\u2019.22 While the IOM does not elaborate, there is perhaps a subtext \nhere: a failure to meet the \u2018international community\u2019s\u2019 standard risks the perception \nthat you are a weak link in the security chain, or at worst, a \u2018failed state\u2019 where disorder \nbreeds, spilling over into the international community.23\n \n  \n                                                 \n20 <http:\/\/www.iom.int\/armenia\/projects\/cbmmp.htm>. See Bojcun (2005) for a fuller discussion of the \nIOM\u2019s promotion of capacity building projects in the context of Ukraine. Bojcun offers some valuable \ninsights about IOM\u2019s working methods, especially its project oriented approach. He documents how the \nIOM assisted Ukraine in setting up a \u2018demonstration project\u2019 on its eastern border with Russia in the \nKharkiv-Belgorod vicinity. Drawing on the results of the project, the IOM Kiev Mission Chief Steve Cook \ncommentated: \u2018that sector of the border, previously the most travelled by illegal migrants, has been \nbasically shut down\u2026 that\u2019s what we wanted to demonstrate, and as a result we\u2019ve got sufficient donor \nfunds to develop another project on the Ukrainian-Belorussian border.\u2019 (quoted in Bojcun 2005: 6). \n21 http:\/\/www.usa.am\/news\/2008\/december\/news121608.php \n22 http:\/\/www.iom.int\/jahia\/Jahia\/about-migration\/managing-migration\/passport-visa-\nsystems\/cache\/offonce;jsessionid=0969CA18FD3E963DCFEDD0E97A90A9E4.worker01 \n23 On the discourse and politics of \u2018failed states\u2019, and their resonance with imperial justifications for \ninterventions in the international order, see Jones (2008) and Morton and Bilgon (2002). \n 18 \nThe provision of funding, technical and logistical support, coupled with a climate of \ndiplomatic and geopolitical normativity, constitute important dynamics underpinning \nthe international government of borders. They help to explain how the IOM is able to \ndisseminate norms and standards that reshape the landscape of bordering practices. \nHowever, a fuller appreciation of the international government of borders is only \npossible if we consider the wider field of networking and partnership. It is where IOM \ncan align its activities with larger projects of regional governmentality, development, \nand aid that we can expect its activities to have their fuller effects. The most intense \nform of this is surely connected with the enlargement of the EU. It is to this scene that \nwe turn in the following section. It is here that IOM can work with the grain of states \nwho strive to join the EU. Since a crucial pillar of meeting the standards for EU \nmembership is the demonstrated ability of applicant states to properly govern their \nrespective borders and exposure to migratory processes, the geopolitics of European \n\u2018enlargement\u2019 provides a particularly fertile ground for the development and \nimplementation of IOM projects.  \n \nPartnerships, Networks, Regions \nHow does the international government of borders intersect with particular \nspatializations of government, such as the network and the region, and particular \nethicalized stylings of government, such as the partnership and the dialogue?24\nAcross the Western Balkans, IOM is involved in projects that deliver to the governments \nlegal expertise in the matters of migration and support the development of the \nNational Action Plans (NAP). The European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), oriented \ntowards the countries of Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean that have no prospects \nof imminent EU membership, offers these countries increased political, security, \neconomic, and cultural co-operation geared towards future integration. The ENP avails \nitself of Action Plans, namely a set of common priorities to be agreed with each partner \ncountry. The idea of the action plan is now widespread across many policy domains, \nboth domestic and international. Rather than taking it at face value, or merely \ndismissing this as policy jargon, we insist that action plans should be understood as a \nkey technique through which governments become constructed as agents bearing \nethical responsibility and calculability for reforming particular policy domains. It is the \ninstrument of the action plan that configures a new kind of relationship between \ngovernments, the international community, and the control of state borders. For \n The \narea that IOM demarcates as the \u2018Western Balkans\u2019 offers one particular setting where \nthe operationalization of the international government of borders through networks \nand partnerships is quite evident.  \n                                                 \n24 On the question of how to analyze spatializations and imagined territories of government see Rose \n(1999: 34-40). For a discussion of the region as a particular spatialization of government, and its \nconnection to neoliberalism, see Larner and Walters (2002). For excellent accounts of the network as \nboth space and technology of rule, see Duffield (2001) on aid and development and Barry (1996) on \nEuropean governance.   \n 19 \nexample, Integrated Border Management (IBM) in Western Balkans, developed in light \nof the adoption of national Integrated Border Management strategies and national \naction plans, consists of institution building (border guard and customs), coordination \nand harmonization of procedures, upgrading of the information technology systems, \nand equipment supply and infrastructure works such as border demarcation, \nsurveillance equipment, etc (CARDS 2004:27). Developed under the framework of the \nexternal dimension of the common European asylum and immigration policy with the \naim of integrating asylum into the EU\u2019s external relations with third countries, this \nmodality of cooperation is geared towards\u2019 amending countries\u2019 existing migration and \nasylum policy so as to enable regional and European integration of Western Balkans.  \nIOM here plays a crucial role at the national level. This takes place as for example in \nSerbia via direct participation in working groups set up for the drafting of legislation on \naliens, asylum, and citizenship (IOM 2004a). In Croatia, IOM promotes the Migration \nPolicy Advisory Study which aims to review policy on migration and make \nrecommendations for a new policy. In both countries IOM offers training in EU Law and \nimmigration and asylum policy to government officials, representatives of International \nOrganizations, NGOs and other agencies (ibid.,). The aim is to introduce from a legal \npoint of view the EU immigration and asylum policy to officials and practitioners \nworking on the development or implementation of national migration strategies.  \nIOM intervenes also at the regional level. In the Western Balkans, border management \nis part of the IOM\u2019s implementation of the so-called \u2018migration module\u2019 in the project \nEstablishment of EU compatible legal, regulatory and institutional framework in the field \nof asylum, migration and visa matters (ibid.,).25\n                                                 \n25 For a short description of this project as well a more comprehensive overview of similar projects \n The project is organized in thee \nmodules, each implemented by a different body. The asylum module is carried out by \nthe UNHCR, the visa module by the International Centre for Migration Policy \nDevelopment (ICMPD) and the migration module by the IOM. The project\u2019s objective is \nto support Albania, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, and Serbia & \nMontenegro in fulfilling the requirements of the Schengen acquis and those set up by \nthe Stabilization and Association Agreements (SAAs). The latter are the contractual \ninstruments of the Stabilization and Association Process (SAp) adopted in 2000 with \nthe aim to offer to the countries of Western Balkans a prospect of full European \nintegration. Given the stakes of EU membership, it might seem that states\u2019 \ncollaboration with IOM is a matter of coercion and that the EU is imposing its norms \nand standards for border control upon the countries of the Western Balkans. However, \nwe insist that the situation is more complex one. The EU has indeed collectively defined \nstandards and norms for a particular regime of borders and controls. The IOM however \ndoes not simply function like a missionary, preaching the gospel of good migration \nmanagement to a series of reluctant and recalcitrant governments situated at the \nhttp:\/\/www.iom.hu\/regprojects\/rm_completed.html#tcm accessed 12\/02\/2010 \n \n 20 \nmodern day limes of the EU. As one IOM official associated with the organization\u2019s \nBelgrade office explains it, in the case of the IOM\u2019s work with the Serbian Government:  \n\u201cIt is the other way around. We work everywhere on invitation of governments. The \nobjective of the government is to move towards the EU standards. We work with the \ngovernment more as a partner, we have an advisory role when it comes to provision of \nresources, we provide information on EU standards, facilitate the cooperation\/talks \nwith other governments in the region, with the counterparts in western Europe on what \nstandards and practices are there. [\u2026] We are helping them to meet the priorities they \nhave laid out and as far as they need advice, specifically on technical and policy issues \nof migration. One of the objectives of the government here has to do with accession so \nwe are trying to develop larger framework of border management and this involves \nstandards concerning entry and admission. We are providing inputs, establishing a \nstrategy structure and eventually legislative initiatives or ministerial instructions to \nimplement some of the standards they are trying to develop.\u201d26\n \n \nThe activities and programmes that IOM implements and partakes in the case of states \nWestern Balkan are part of the regime that is disseminating norms and standards \ngeared towards EU accession.27\n                                                 \n26 Interview conducted on the 21st July 2004 by Rutvica Andrijasevic and Manuela Bojadzijev as part of the \nTransit Migration research project. \n Through these IOM has gained access to varying \ndegrees of influence over the internal affairs and involvement in shaping of the social \nand political processes of the governments it works with. Private-public networks and \npartnership between IOM, EU, governments of Western Balkan states, and NGOs are \nkey to this process. In fact, following Duffield, we can observe the \u2018thickening of \ninternational [\u2026] networks between metropolitan and borderland areas\u2019 (Duffield 2001: \n309). These networks are part of what Duffield identifies as organizational innovation in \nthe ways in which metropolitan states govern the borderlands. Governing though \ninternational assistance networks and private associations create new forms of \ninteraction and dependency between states and non-state actors via contracts, \nstandards (performance indicators), and partnerships and constitute novel and flexible \nforms of alliances and power configuration (318). These have elsewhere been discussed \nas examples of \u2018shared sovereignty\u2019 (Rigo 2007) and \u2018overlapping sovereignty\u2019 (Ong \n2006) so as to indicate that the transformations in the mode of governing are resulting \nin state sovereignty being \u2018shared\u2019 among different state and non-state actors and are \nengendering differently administrated spaces and patterns of noncontiguous \nsovereignty. While its beyond the scope of this article to engage in the debates about \nsovereign power, what we want to stress is that the case of IOM\u2019s interventions in \nWestern Balkans shows (IOM competes for EC tenders, Western Balkan states contract \nhttp:\/\/www.transitmigration.org  \n27 We have focused here in IOM programmes in the Western Balkans given the limits of place. It is worth \nnoting that IOM has been involved in similar projects geared towards EU enlargement under so-called \nSoderkoping Process namely the cross-border cooperation process between three \u2018clusters\u2019 of countries \n(1. Belarus, Ukraine, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia; 2. Ukraine, Hungary and Slovakia; and 3. \nUkraine, Moldova and Romania).  \n 21 \nIOM, and IOM approaches governments in terms of \u2018clients\u2019) that the relationships \nbetween state and non-state actors is not the one of straightforward imposition; rather \nit points to a significant reworking of international authority and power as it takes place \nvia the international government of borders.   \n  \nThe neoliberal government of deportation \nAs we show in the previous section, IOM programmes seek to implicate states in new \nregimes which govern them through regulated autonomy, networks and partnerships. \nIn this final section we would also like to draw attention to a neoliberal element \nintroduced into the actual practices by which states govern borders and populations. \nThis can be illustrated through the example of so called Assisted Voluntary Return \n(AVR) programmes geared towards removing rejected asylum seekers, stranded and \nirregular migrants and returning them to their countries of departure. First carried out \nin Germany in 1970, IOM has over the years greatly expanded the number and scope of \nthese initiatives. In 2004, it ran twenty AVR programmes, removing migrants from \neighteen European countries.28\nScholars and activists have been quick to criticize IOM\u2019s AVR programmes, pointing out \nthat the use of the adjective \u2018voluntary\u2019 in relation to deportation is a contradiction in \nterms. As in the case of Lampedusa, for example, Italy\u2019s most southern island and the \nentry point for irregular migration from Libya, the IOM\u2019s involvement in deporting \nasylum seekers and irregular migrants from Lampedusa\u2019s detention centre to Libya \u2013\noperations often executed by use of force\u2014suggests that when migrants make the \ndecision to return under duress or as an alternative to state-enforced expulsions, \n\u2018voluntary\u2019 seems to designate an absence of viable options rather than a deliberate \nchoice.\n As with many of the other IOM programmes described \nabove, AVRs are implemented by the IOM, in collaboration with governments and \nNGOs and hence developed as private-public partnerships.  \n29\nYet, let us offer an example of another AVR programme, this time run by IOM in the \nNetherlands in 2002, and targeting migrants from South Caucasus. The AVR \ndistinguishes three categories of potential \u2018returnees\u2019. First, those who are illegal and \n \n                                                 \n28 It is difficult to identify precisely what nationalities of migrants AVRs Programme target but they seem \nto be country specific and often reflect the movements of the refugee populations. Here are some \nexamples: Assisted Voluntary Return (AVR) Programme to Bosnia and Herzegovina and to Kosovo \nprovince (SCG) for Rejected Asylum Seekers\/Irregular Migrants Currently Residing in the Canton of Vaud \n(Switzerland); Assisted Voluntary Return and Reintegration Assistance for Congolese Asylum Seekers \nfrom Belgium; Assisted Voluntary Return of Afghan Asylum Seekers from Greece (under the \nAKTINERGIA programme); General Assisted Voluntary Return Program for Unsuccessful Asylum Seekers \nand Irregular Migrants Currently Residing in France (GARIF); Assisted Voluntary Return and \nReintegration Assistance for Congolese Asylum Seekers from the United Kingdom; and DNA Testing for \nFamily Reunification for Families Living in Italy. http:\/\/www.iom.int\/jahia\/Jahia\/op\/edit\/pid\/747 \n29 For a more detailed discussion on IOM\u2019s role in detention and deportation in Lampedusa and Libya and \nthe relationship of deportation to the constitution of European citizenship see Andrijasevic (2010).  \n 22 \ndid not apply for regularization or asylum, second, migrants who have applied for \nasylum, have been rejected and are not appealing the decision, and third, those who \nstatus is of temporary nature on the basis that they are awaiting the results of their \nappeal or have been granted a humanitarian status or a residence permit as a refugee \nor a victim of trafficking. For each category IOM offers a financial incentive such as a \nmaximum of EUR 135 for a single applicant in the first, EUR 225 in the second, and EUR \n570 in the third category. All of these are slightly higher in case of a family with children \nstarting from a maximum of EUR 320 for the first two groups and EUR 800 for the last \none. 30\nAVR\u2019s programmes could certainly be viewed as part of the \u2018deportation turn\u2019 (Gibney \n2008) indicating a prodigious rise over the last decade in the use of deportation --the \nstate-authorized removal of non-citizens from state territory-- by Western countries as \na way of dealing with failed asylum-seekers, unlawful migrants, criminals, and \nsuspected terrorists. Yet, whereas deportation is historically regarded and practiced as \na forceful and sometimes violent transfer of people, IOM\u2019s activities in this field point to \na new model to which we refer here as neoliberal deportation. From this point of view, \n\u2018voluntary\u2019 does not stand for whether a migrant has been deported willingly or not but \nrather for the organizational modality of the AVR programmes. AVRs are not about \nforced removal but instead they explore and experiment with ways of enlisting the \ncooperation of migrants in their own expulsion through the provision of forms of \ninformation, assistance, and financial inducement. Of course, the history of deportation \nreveals that AVR is not the first time that migrants have been \u2018encouraged\u2019 to vacate a \nstate\u2019s territory by positive as well as negative means (Ngai 2004; Walters 2002a). Yet \nthe fact that, at least in the Dutch case, one sees a finely-graded financial calculus \napplied to the diverse forms and contexts of unwanted migrancy suggests at the very \nleast that we are witnessing new developments in the economic rationalization of \ndeportation. This is an economic rationalization, which seeks to attain its effects by \ntreating the migrant target not as a homogeneous mass, but as something to be broken \ndown, perhaps even individualized, so that economic incentives can achieve a more \ncalibrated contact with the particular lives and circumstances in question. As with \nrecent developments in the administration of poverty and crime, the practice of \n What is of interest here is that this programme targets both \u2018illegal\u2019 as well as \n\u2018legal\u2019 migrants. It hence aids governments to deport irregular migrants but it also \noffers monetary incentives to migrants such as those who have not yet concluded the \nasylum determination process or those who have been granted a resident permit albeit \ntemporarily to return to their countries of origin. Alongside the offer of monetary \nincentives, AVR programmes might also offer pre-departure, transportation, and post-\narrival assistance meaning that they provide migrants with information, referral, and \nhelp with administrative issues regarding their departure from the host country or with \na limited reinsertion logistic support in the countries of destination.  \n                                                 \n30 This economic rationale is further nuanced in case a family has more than two children. For each \nadditional child, a family from the first two categories is entitled to maximum of EUR 45 and a family \nfrom the third group, to a maximum of EUR 90 (IOM 2004: 264-265).  \n 23 \ndeportation seems to be opening itself to the neoliberal tactic that Valverde and Mopas \n(2004) describe as \u2018targeted governance\u2019. \nConclusion \nWe started with the observation of a shift in the way in which scholars have approached \nthe question of borders in relation to globalization. If initially this was posed in rather \nzero-sum terms, more recent work seems to imagine bordering and globalization as \nprocesses that often proceed hand in hand. That is, borders are now theorized not \nmerely as remnants of an earlier, supposedly more \u2018territorial\u2019 era destined to be swept \naside by successive waves of regional and global integration. Instead, they are viewed \nas being remade, but now under globalizing conditions. Hence, research is taking up \nthe task of understanding those kinds of borders that are now specific to a global world \n\u2013 however one might want to understand \u2018the global\u2019. \nThis paper has suggested there is a dimension to the contemporary (re-)making of \nborders that deserves much closer attention: the problematization of borders within \nconcrete schemes, programmes and tactics of international expertise and intervention. \nThis is what we call the international government of borders. Certainly the fact that a \nsignificant literature exists concerning the role of EU agencies, laws, and concepts in \nthe remaking of European borders suggests that the international government of \nborders has not been ignored. However, it has been addressed largely as a sui generis \nEuropean phenomenon, and mostly confined to the subfield of European studies. As \nsuch, it has not been sufficiently connected to wider intellectual currents and political \nissues in global politics. In drawing connections between neoliberalism, \ngovernmentality, and the international government of borders, and in taking IOM as \nour case study, we have tried to show that the study of international expertise and its \nrole in the remaking of borders can be fruitfully broadened beyond the realm of \nEuropean studies. \nA second argument developed in the paper is that a Foucauldian analytics of \nneoliberalism is useful for theorizing the international government of borders, at least \nin the concrete case of the IOM. For it speaks to some of the subtle mechanisms in \noperation by which targeted states are made into active subjects of bordering projects. \nThe fact that governments seek out the assistance of the IOM in improving the \n\u2018management\u2019 of their borders suggests that these aspects of the international \ngovernment of borders cannot fully be grasped by a position that sees nothing more \nthan the continuation of the old games of western imperialism. Through projects that \noften take the mundane form of training seminars, via the promotion of manuals and \ntexts such as handbooks on migration and border management which appear dull and \ntechnical, and through the embedding of these devices in networks of aid, regional \ndevelopment, and schemes of regional and national stabilization, the states of these \nborderlands are encouraged to take up the work of rebordering themselves, enhancing \n 24 \ntheir control \u2018capacities\u2019, and in doing so, enjoined to play a strategic role in the wider \nrebordering of global society.  \nHowever, we do not want to suggest that the international government of borders is in \nany way reducible to the logic of neoliberalism. As we see it, neoliberalism is a lens \nwhich sensitizes the researcher to the presence of particular features and specific styles \nof governing. But it is not the whole story:  we do not want to give the impression that \neverything works by incentivization, networking, self-regulation and managerialization. \nTo go too far in that direction would risk reproducing the irenic and liberal view of \npolitics and world order that underpins so much writing on the theme of \u2018global \ngovernance\u2019.31\nThe fact that the international government of borders constitutes the border as a site \namenable to better \u2018management\u2019 rather than a question of citizenship is integral to \nthis mode of government. A reformulation of the border in terms of technical norms, \nstandards and regulations and their implementation through networks and \npartnerships all allow the control of borders to be represented as \u2018beyond politics\u2019. \nHowever, despite the depoliticized language of management, politics happens in \ntechnocratic spaces. The constitution of borders and of mobility as a primarily a \nproblem of management leads to overlooking the ways in which borders continue to \nproduce hierarchies of access to citizenship and conceals the (political) struggles that \naccompany acts of re-bordering. For this reason, future work on the international \ngovernment of borders would do well to build bridges to other literatures which have \ngiven questions of struggle, authority, police and violence a central place in social \nanalysis (de Genova 2009; Laffey and Weldes 2005; Mezzadra and Neilson 2008; \nSheptycki 2000). A greater emphasis on policing and\/or resistance would offset the \ntendency to see rebordering only as a spatial phenomenon. It would emphasize that \nwhether or not we want to characterize borders as interventions upon a global territory, \nthey are also very real condensations and contestations of policing power.  \n  \n \nReferences \nAlbahari, Maurizio (2006), 'Death and the Modern State: Making Borders and \nSovereignty at the Southern Edges of Europe', Centre for Comparative Immigration \nStudies, UCSD, Working Paper, 137. \nAmoore, Louise, Marmura, Stephen, and Salter, Mark (2008), 'Editorial: Smart Borders \nand Mobilities: Spaces, Zones, Enclosures', Surveillance and Society, 5 (2), 96-101. \nAndrijasevic, R.
