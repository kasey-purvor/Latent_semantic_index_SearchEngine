The last 10 to 15 years have seen an expansion in the \nvolume of research relating to the organisation and management of public services, prompted \ninitially in the United Kingdom by policy-driven efforts to reform the institutions of public \nservices according to evidence of what works.(1)  In the UK and other economically developed \ncountries, the drive towards improving links between research and policy has been driven in part \nby the remarkable ascendancy of evidence-based medicine,(2) which has in a matter of a few \ndecades transformed the delivery of healthcare such that the requirement for robust evidence of \nefficacy and cost-effectiveness is now central to medical education,(3) resource allocation(4) and \nprofessional regulation.(5) \nG.P. Martin et al. (2011) Prospects for knowledge exchange in health policy and management: \ninstitutional and epistemic boundaries. Journal of Health Services Research & Policy 16(4): 211-217 \nDOI: 10.1258\/jhsrp.2011.010132 \nThis is the final draft, after peer-review, of a manuscript published in Journal of Health Services \nResearch & Policy. The definitive version, detailed above, is available online at www.rsmjournals.com. \n2 \nThere is increasing recognition, however, that the model of evidence-based medicine, and \nthe modes by which it has been implemented, do not provide an unproblematic template for \nincreasing the influence of management research on management practice.  Social research in \nhealthcare is methodologically heterogeneous, and so the epistemological assumptions of the \nhierarchy of biomedical evidence, which proposes that some forms of research are superior to \nothers, are inappropriate.(6)  Social research is also frequently highly contingent upon local \ncircumstance: specifics of context matter in a way in which they do not for most biomedical (or \nat least pharmaceutical) research.(7)  Finally, social research can be used in diverse ways, not just \nas a straightforward instrumental guide to \u201ebest practice\u201f, but also more conceptually, to challenge and \nchange ways of thinking and approaches to the day-to-day issues facing healthcare managers.(8,9) \nThis has led several commentators to claim that a new way of conceptualising the \nrelationship between research and practice is needed in relation to management and other social \nresearch, moving away from the linear and simplistic connotations of models of \u201eknowledge \ntransfer\u201f.  The ideas of \u201eMode 2\u201f knowledge production, in which research knowledge is produced \ncloser to the context of its application,(10) have been incorporated into some healthcare \nmanagement research projects,(11-13) but others have highlighted challenges with this way of \nconducting and applying research.(14)  Some authors have called for greater cross-pollination \nbetween research and practice, through the involvement of decision-makers in research and of \nresearchers in decision-making,(15) or through the introduction of \u201eknowledge-brokering\u201f roles to \nfacilitate dialogue between the two groups.(16)  More generally, Davies et al. argue for \n\u201eknowledge interaction\u201f as a way of understanding the \u201cmessy engagement of multiple players\u201d \ninvolved in research-knowledge utilisation through linkage, exchange and knowledge brokerage, \nas well as more conventional processes of dissemination.(17) \nThere is an emergent literature on the ways in which such processes give rise to utilisation \nof research knowledge, and some evidence of their effectiveness.(8)  However, there has been a \nsurprising absence of study of the connections between the commissioners and producers of social \nresearch in health and other public-management fields.  Since Caplan\u201fs famous characterisation \nof researchers and policymakers as two epistemic communities,(9) lacking the will or ability to \ncommunicate with one another, research has focused largely on the potential to bridge the gap \ndownstream, between producers and users of research.  As those responsible for setting the aims, \nobjectives and terms of research projects at their conception, though, commissioners have a \npotentially vital upstream role in mediating the gap between research and practice, bringing the \nviews and interests of healthcare managers (and other practice-based stakeholders, such as health \nprofessionals, policymakers and patients) to bear on what research is done.  There have been \nsome developments in the way research is commissioned in the UK and elsewhere, with a growth \nof policy- and practice-led research-funding programmes in healthcare alongside traditional, \nacademically oriented streams such as those offered through block grants and research councils.  \nThe National Institute for Health Research\u201fs Service Delivery and Organisation stream, for \nexample, consults wideranging groups, including healthcare managers, in commissioning practice-\noriented academic research. Yet to date, the roles of research commissioners\u2014and the views of \nboth commissioners and producers on the commissioning process\u2014have been neglected in the \nliterature on research-knowledge utilisation. \nThis paper seeks to begin to remedy this gap in the literature.  It focuses on the \ncommissioning of research relating to the organisation and management of healthcare and other \npublic services, in the British context.  It draws on an interview-based study of the views and \nexperiences of government- and NHS-based commissioners of research, and the producers of \nthat research (in both universities and independent consultancies).  It asks two principal \nquestions: \n What kinds of notions of research knowledge do the roles of these parties, and the \nexpectations of other stakeholders around them, give rise to, and how do these differ \nG.P. Martin et al. (2011) Prospects for knowledge exchange in health policy and management: \ninstitutional and epistemic boundaries.

The definitive version, detailed above, is available online at www.rsmjournals.com. \n3 \nbetween commissioners and producers? \n What can be done upstream to mitigate these differences and assist the production of \nresearch knowledge that is more readily utilised by healthcare managers and other \nstakeholders downstream? \nIt seeks to answer these questions by analysing in particular respondents\u201f accounts of the \npriorities and pressures they face in commissioning and producing research, commissioners\u201f and \nproducers\u201f respective conceptualisations of the nature and value of research knowledge, and their \nideas about how divergent views on these issues might be reconciled. \nMethods \nThe data presented in this paper derive from a small-scale study from 2007 of the commissioners \nand producers of research relating to public policy and management in the UK, including \ncommissioners within central government, the NHS and other research-commissioning \norganisations, and producers in universities and independent-sector consultancies and think \ntanks.  The former group was identified through approaches to research-commissioning \norganisations, the latter via searches of the academic and grey literatures.  Approaches were made \nto commissioners and providers across the range of public policy and management research, but \nwith a particular emphasis on healthcare given the recent policy efforts around knowledge \ntranslation in this field.  Further respondents were recruited through snowball sampling, and \nrecruitment continued until \u201etheoretical saturation\u201f of the issues of interest was reached.  \nParticipants were asked through semi-structured interviews about the kinds of policy- and \nmanagement-related research contracts they commissioned or competed for, the criteria of \nquality they applied in evaluating research, and the relationship (actual and normative) between \nresearch, policy and practice.  Participants were drawn from various fields of public-service \nprovision, primarily health and social care, but also local government, labour-market policy and \npublic management in general. \nEighteen interviews were carried out, lasting around 1.5 hours on average.  Nine \ninterviewees worked primarily as university-based academics, four were researchers in \nindependent-sector organisations, and five were commissioners of research.  Half of the \nrespondents worked primarily or substantially in healthcare-related research.  The university-\nbased providers interviewed were predominantly senior-level (professorial) academics; \nindependent-sector providers had similarly lengthy experience; commissioners tended to have \nsomewhat less experience of commissioning research, but had experience of academic, civil-\nservice and public-management roles.  Interviews were fully transcribed, and analysis was led by \n[Author1].  Analysis adopted the framework approach,(18) which attempts to combine a focus on \ncertain, preconceived themes for analysis with a sensitivity to other, unanticipated issues \npresented by participants. It involves categorising data according to these preconceived and \ninductively generated themes, enabling analysis within and across participants\u201f interviews.  The \nanalysis was checked by the other authors, both of whom were involved in the inception of the \nstudy, and following critical discussion a final, agreed set of themes and interpretations was \nreached. \nFindings \nWe divide our findings into three subsections.  Under \u201eCompeting priorities\u201f, we consider how \ninstitutional norms within academia and commissioning organisations give rise to different \nexpectations about the substance, scope and timescales of research, and about what constitutes \n\u201egood-quality\u201f research.  Next, under \u201eCognitive boundaries\u201f, we explore the consequences of \nthese institutional differences for the ways the outputs of research are\u2014or are not\u2014valued, \ndisseminated and utilised.  Finally, under \u201eMediating the boundaries\u201f, we discuss the prospects for \nG.P. Martin et al.

Many noted a positive change in government attitudes \ntowards research, but they also highlighted some of the challenges this brought. \nIn particular, academic researchers noted that the rapid turnover of policies, ministers and \ncivil servants could have disruptive effects.  As previous policy was disregarded, so too was \nprevious research, even though for academics, it had not lost its significance: \n\u201cI\u201fm old enough now to have seen them come round twice and they\u201fll come round once \nmore before I\u201fve had it.  But the people making the policy often have only been in post a \nyear and they\u201fll be gone in a year.  And so their organisational memory\u201fs difficult to \ngenerate.\u201d (I16, university provider) \nProviders of research consequently found commissioners with much shorter time horizons than \ntheir own, preoccupied with immediate policy priorities subject to change at short notice \nfollowing a shift in ministerial or civil-service personnel.  On the other side, research \ncommissioners found academics reluctant to respond appropriately to these pressures, and more \ninclined to focus on their own agenda than address the questions they had been commissioned to \nanswer.  They were also clear on what was creating this tension: the priorities of academics were \ndominated by academic institutions, particularly the Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) (now \nsucceeded by the similar Research Excellence Framework) by which academic departments were \njudged and core funding distributed: \n\u201cGetting universities to work with us in customer-supplier relationships and to really listen \nto the requirements of the customer [is challenging. \u2026] The provider and the purchaser \nhave information asymmetry and often the provider knows more. [...] And I know very \nwell why this happens: one wants to score RAE points as well as serve the needs of the \npurchaser of government research out of the same pot of money.\u201d (I17, commissioner) \nUniversity-based academics recognised these conflicting pressures, and spoke of the \nchallenges of reconciling the RAE and other academic institutions with doing research that \nwould meet commissioners\u201f needs and inform policy and management: \n\u201cYou\u201fre trying to do two things at the same time.  You\u201fre trying to write a report for \ncommissioned research and you\u201fre trying to write an academic paper.  And the theory is \nthat you write the report as you\u201fre going to write the academic paper and then you just do a \nbit of fiddling.  But actually I think it\u201fs quite fundamental[ly different].\u201d (I6, university \nprovider) \nCommissioners felt that the RAE and associated performance-management measures in \nuniversities were distorting university providers\u201f priorities, deterring them both from carrying out \nresearch with real-world application, and from disseminating this work beyond conventional, \nRAE-returnable outputs: \n\u201cTo be blunt, academics aren\u201ft really very interested in dissemination outside the academic \ncommunity, are they?\u201d (I13, commissioner) \nIn sum, the exigencies of the institutions of government and academia were acknowledged \non both sides as creating strong pressures on the kind of research that was required and valued.  \nMoreover, these institutions seemed to be pulling producers and commissioners in opposite \ndirections, with academics asked to produce very different outputs for their masters in \nuniversities and their customers in policy.  What was the result in terms of the nature of the \nresearch produced and the way in which it is utilised?  The next subsection considers this \nquestion in detail. \nG.P. Martin et al. (2011) Prospects for knowledge exchange in health policy and management: \ninstitutional and epistemic boundaries. Journal of Health Services Research & Policy 16(4): 211-217 \nDOI: 10.1258\/jhsrp.2011.010132 \nThis is the final draft, after peer-review, of a manuscript published in Journal of Health Services \nResearch & Policy. The definitive version, detailed above, is available online at www.rsmjournals.com. \n5 \nCognitive boundaries \nIn general terms, there was dissatisfaction on both sides with the consequences of these pressures \nfor the way in which the current system operated.  This applied to the process of policy-research \ncommissioning, to the format taken by the product and, most fundamentally, to the nature of the \nproduct offered, particularly by university-based providers.  Ultimately, then, this dispute over the \nnature and value of research-based knowledge went beyond issues associated with the tendering \nprocess and translating findings to cater for the expectations of different epistemic communities.  \nRather, it was a question of fundamentally divergent understandings of what constituted good-quality, \nrelevant and valid research-based information for the purpose of policymaking. \nResearch commissioners expressed frustration about the difficulty of managing their \ncontracts with university providers to ensure responsiveness and relevance of research, calling for \nmore of a \u201ctrade-off\u201d (I16, commissioner) between quality and timeliness.  Academics often \ncraved a rather different model of research commissioning\u2014\u201cgo away, do good science, tell us at \nthe end when you\u201fve finished\u201d (I3, university provider)\u2014and acknowledged that even policy-\noriented research contracts gave them the freedom to be distracted by \u201einteresting side issues\u201f.  \nThis, along with the competing pressures arising from the RAE and other sources, could indeed \nresult in neglect of what commissioners wanted: \n\u201cAcademics can be like jobbing builders: you go round and you start a job and you get the \nscaffolding up in one place, just to reassure your client that you\u201fve started.  And then you \ngo off for six weeks and do something else.\u201d (I6, university provider) \nAcademics and commissioners alike also recognised deficiencies in the communication of \nresearch findings across boundaries.  Once again, pressures and norms of academia were seen as \nresulting in outputs that failed to meet the need of those who had paid for them: \n \u201cI have seen academic research coming out with post-modernist theory which is entirely \nunusable in the field.  Because it\u201fs working in a conceptual frame that nobody understands. \n[...] There are some issues about how the academic world navigates the tension between \nacademic theory and the empirical practicalities of the day job of the clients.\u201d (I14, \nindependent-sector provider) \nIn the main, academics accepted the need to maximise accessibility of their research findings, and \nfavoured more diverse forms of dissemination than they had traditionally practised. However, \nthey were not convinced that what they saw as the preoccupation of commissioners with \nresponsiveness and timeliness of findings was something which would unproblematically improve the \nappropriateness and relevance of their research to policymaking and management practice.  Rather, \nthey articulated a competing vision of how policy-oriented research might contribute to policy \nand practice. \nFor a start, academics suggested that a concern for timeliness of research outputs might \nrisk losing the insights that could only come from longer-term study, free of the shackles of \nshort-term policy requirements.  The fast-moving policy scene, some academics felt, had \nproduced a research-commissioning process which fetishised the novel, neglecting lessons from \nthe past.  Government- and NHS-based commissioners, too, were aware of the risk of being \ndriven by the latest \u201efads\u201f of policy.  There was a concern among some to commission \u201ctopics \nthat are likely to be of enduring interest\u201d (I13, commissioner), reconciling the shorter-term \nconcerns of their policymaking colleagues with the longer timescales preferred by academics. \nHowever, commissioners pointed out that the desire of academic research providers to \ncarry out work that would make a contribution to the academic literature created its own \npreoccupations.  The commitment to creating \u201enew knowledge\u201f, publishable in top-ranking \njournals and offering a lasting contribution to science, represented a different kind of fetish for \nnovelty, driving academic research providers away from policy-oriented outputs.  This was \nreflected in the way academics discussed their research: \n\u201cThe question we come back to with an assignment is [\u2026] \u201eDoes this contribute to the \nG.P. Martin et al. (2011) Prospects for knowledge exchange in health policy and management: \ninstitutional and epistemic boundaries. Journal of Health Services Research & Policy 16(4): 211-217 \nDOI: 10.1258\/jhsrp.2011.010132 \nThis is the final draft, after peer-review, of a manuscript published in Journal of Health Services \nResearch & Policy. The definitive version, detailed above, is available online at www.rsmjournals.com. \n6 \ngeneration of new knowledge?\u201f [\u2026] We would always try to see things written up in an \nappropriate way for an academic journal because that enters the permanent literature.  In \nan academic journal or a book or whatever, but seeing it entering the permanent literature, \nso that in 15 years\u201f time, when someone does a search on subject X, you want them to be \nable to find that research.\u201d (I7, university provider) \nAcademic research providers, then, held very different notions of what constituted \u201enovelty\u201f and \n\u201einfluence\u201f\u2014and therefore value\u2014of research from those held by commissioners.  Yet, as even \nsome academics acknowledged, this meant risking disregarding the more direct influence that \ncould arise from engaging with the needs and wants of commissioners: \n\u201cAcademics underestimate the difference that they can make.  It won\u201ft be quoted in the \nknowledge in the way that someone writing a book after you will refer to what you\u201fve \ndone, but your ideas will go in, and somebody somewhere will remember them and say, \n\u201eHang on\u201f.\u201d (I9, university provider) \nOn each side, then, research and its products were valued very differently.  For most \nacademic providers, the value of research knowledge was best measured by its scientific novelty, \nand by lasting contribution to the social-scientific literature, through (for example) citation many \nyears later.  For commissioners, research knowledge was valuable if it spoke to current issues, and \nif it influenced practitioners in a more direct\u2014but more diffuse and less measurable\u2014way.  The \ncombination of the ill-aligned institutional pressures considered in the previous subsection, and \nthis differing conception of what research knowledge is, and should be valued, gave rise to a \nfundamental mismatch of expectations about what research was for, how it should be done, and \nhow it should be disseminated. \nMediating the boundaries \nThe problems in the commissioning, production and utilisation of knowledge identified by \nproviders and commissioners were, then, three-fold.  There was frequently a lack of effective \ncommunication of research findings across this boundary; there were markedly different \nconstructions of what kinds of knowledge (in terms of scope, theoretical content and historical \ncontext) were of most relevance and utility to the policymaking process; most fundamentally of \nall, there was a divergence between how research was valued by the institutions and actors of \nacademia and those of government. \nYet there was also considerable common ground about the need to improve the \nappropriateness of the knowledge produced: \n \u201c[It\u201fs about] putting it in a context for the policymaker.  And I think often because we \ndon\u201ft make that first connection, we launch straight into our research and the policymaker \njust goes, \u201eBut I\u201fm not interested in this\u201f.  If my research study takes me three years, it \ndoesn\u201ft matter it\u201fs taken me three years, as long as when I present it, [\u2026] I connect it with \ndebates of the day.\u201d (I1, university provider) \n\u201cWhat turns people off is research information and papers that are long, laborious, not \nfocused and it switches them off.  So it\u201fs how we make it accessible for them.\u201d (I11, \ncommissioner) \nGiven this eagerness to improve alignment between research outputs and users\u201f needs, and to \ntranslate the value ascribed to their work by academics into something practically valuable to \npolicymakers and practitioners, what kinds of approaches to mediating the boundaries might be \nfeasible? \nRespondents from both sides highlighted how the commissioning process itself might be \nimproved.  Research providers felt they should be involved more closely in the development of \ncalls for research proposals.  Commissioners were more concerned that the users of research\u2014\npolicy colleagues and public-service managers beyond Whitehall\u2014be involved more closely, to \nensure prioritisation of practical over academic concerns.  Again, apparent was a divergence of \nG.P. Martin et al. (2011) Prospects for knowledge exchange in health policy and management: \ninstitutional and epistemic boundaries. Journal of Health Services Research & Policy 16(4): 211-217 \nDOI: 10.1258\/jhsrp.2011.010132 \nThis is the final draft, after peer-review, of a manuscript published in Journal of Health Services \nResearch & Policy. The definitive version, detailed above, is available online at www.rsmjournals.com. \n7 \nviews about the relationship between, and relative importance of, academic integrity and practical \nrelevance: \n\u201cSometimes we\u201fre asked to do commissioned research where there isn\u201ft much academic \nunderstanding: [we face] commissioners who don\u201ft want to or don\u201ft understand the \nacademic basis of issues they\u201fre thinking about.\u201d (I8, university provider) \n\u201cWe\u201fve been trying to do more to get ideas about research priorities from practitioners, \nparticularly the service-management practitioners. [...] Our peer-review, commissioning \nrules are somewhat dominated by academics.\u201d (I13, commissioner) \nSome commissioners called for a more mixed economy of research provision, with parallel \nfunding for shorter-term consultancy projects led by independent institutes outside the university \nsector, alongside longer-term research, which they felt would address concerns around the \ntimeliness, responsiveness, and communication of research.  However, for university-sector \nproviders in particular, this did not address the fundamental issue: that academically rigorous \nresearch is relevant and valuable to policymakers and practitioners, if only ways might be found \nof communicating and mobilising this knowledge more effectively. \nIn this light, for university-based respondents a more appropriate response to the \ndissatisfaction with the current situation was not to supplement the work done (largely) by \nacademics with some kind of \u201eresearch lite\u201f, but to work to ensure that the fruits of research were \nmore appetising for their potential consumers.  With these concerns in mind, respondents \ncommented on the importance of building these links by one means or another.  The concept of \nthe \u201eknowledge broker\u201f received some support, with commissioners highlighting the potential for \nexpanding their roles in mediating between the research work they commissioned and the \nutilisers of that research within and beyond Whitehall.  However, for others, a better model of \nknowledge brokerage involved more direct interaction between the producers and users of \nresearch.  Providers in particular stressed the limitations of a process of dissemination that \nconstructed research findings as a \u201eproduct\u201f, an inert, final entity to be applied unproblematically \nto different settings by a third party: \n\u201cSome people would argue that it\u201fs very important to put in place knowledge brokers who \ncan take the knowledge from research and translate it and present it to practice \ncommunities.  I [prefer] the idea that you promote interworking, so that people get to \nknow each other.\u201d (I7, university provider) \nFor academics, greater interaction between the producers and commissioners of research \nwas not about ensuring straightforward \u201eknowledge transfer\u201f from the former to the latter, but \nabout bringing the users of research into contact with a distinctive way of thinking about \nproblems.  Research knowledge, for providers, did not offer \u201esolutions\u201f to be packaged and \ndelivered to users, but rather, a different way of thinking about problems: \n\u201cAcademics have a role in cross-fertilisation.  So I can say \u201eHave you tried what they\u201fre \ndoing here?\u201f [\u2026] or \u201eYou ought to go and visit such-and-such place\u201f.  But that\u201fs an \ninformal process.\u201d (I14, independent-sector provider) \n\u201cAt the moment, the form of engagement [between research and practice]\u2014this is a \ncaricature\u2014but it\u201fs the academic gurus, oracles, and we go and give a shaft of light, or we \nsing an aria and somehow people will improve what they\u201fre doing.  That\u201fs not my model of \nhow the link between theory and practice should work.\u201d (I18, university provider) \nWhat was needed, academics argued, was a model of engagement that encouraged interaction \nbetween researchers, policymakers and practitioners, to facilitate critical engagement with a set of \ntheories and methods, so that research users might benefit from research as a mindset rather than \na product. \nResearch commissioners, however, were largely doubtful about how far such ideas would \nfind a receptive audience among managers and policymakers.  Given competing pressures on \ntheir time, this critical interactive model was not one for which they would have time: rather, \nG.P. Martin et al. (2011) Prospects for knowledge exchange in health policy and management: \ninstitutional and epistemic boundaries. Journal of Health Services Research & Policy 16(4): 211-217 \nDOI: 10.1258\/jhsrp.2011.010132 \nThis is the final draft, after peer-review, of a manuscript published in Journal of Health Services \nResearch & Policy. The definitive version, detailed above, is available online at www.rsmjournals.com. \n8 \ncommissioners envisaged a more conventional division of research labour, with professional \nresearchers to \u201edo the thinking\u201f and provide the insights for them in a digestible format: \n\u201cPeople\u201fs main priority is first and foremost sorting out their own local organisation. [\u2026] \nIt\u201fs about the business benefit of research and what research can deliver.  I don\u201ft think that \nresearch is a solution looking for a problem; I think we have to start with the problem and \nthen work back. [\u2026 Managers] need to be able to access resources and support according \nto the needs that they\u201fre going to define in their own local organisations.  I don\u201ft think they \nneed to have the ins and outs of a comprehensive knowledge around research specifically.  \nBut they need to know how to access it.\u201d (I10, commissioner) \n\u201c[Public managers are] an exceptionally difficult community to reach in terms of research \nawareness, research literacy and the whole notion of what comprises evidence-informed \npractice.  And the cultural aspects of how low premiums are placed upon that. [\u2026] They\u201fre \npeople who culturally choose not to know things.\u201d (I13, commissioner) \nAgreement about the need for greater interactions across the boundary between research and \npractice masked, once again, considerable divergence on the nature, validity and value of research \nknowledge.  Among public policymakers and public managers, commissioners felt that research \nwas unlikely to command sufficient attention for the model of knowledge mobilisation favoured \nby research providers to gain widespread uptake.  And furthermore, regardless of the question of \nwhat model of knowledge mobilisation is desirable, there remained on both sides more practical \nhurdles to overcome if greater engagement was to be achieved: \n\u201cWithin government, the constraints have been a huge loss of staff, and reliance on \nmanagement consultants, which makes it hard to outreach to the academic community.  [...] \nWithin universities, people are so hard-pressed that they\u201fre not going out looking for things \nto do unless they contribute to the RAE or their own advancement, their own survival.\u201d \n(I9, university provider) \nDiscussion and conclusion \nThe previous section highlights radically different constructions of what constitutes appropriate \nresearch knowledge from commissioners and providers, and some important consequences of \nthese for the relationship between research, policy and practice.  In terms of the first research \nquestion\u2014what notions of research knowledge are held by commissioners and producers in their \nrespective roles in the research economy?\u2014apparent from this study are divergent views on the \nnature of research (a product or a mindset), the value of research (academic versus practical \nutility) and originality of research (academic versus policy currency).  These perspectives seem \nentrenched by different performance-management pressures on each side of the divide, though \nthe academic construction of the value and nature of research also appears to be an integral part \nof academic professional identity. \nThis division gives rise to significant problems in the uptake and usage of research, and it \nalso poses challenges to some of the ways of increasing uptake that have been suggested.  Caplan \nfound that policymakers were inclined to use academic research conceptually as well as \ninstrumentally.(9) Although the conceptual use of research may involve a less immediate, more \ndiffuse effect on research users\u201f mindsets,(19) much of what participants on both sides of the \ndivide in this study say suggests that research knowledge is conceived in increasingly instrumental \nterms.  Perhaps influenced by the legacy of evidence-based medicine, and the accompanying \nbureaucratic approach to implementation of the evidence it produces,(5) there remains a desire \nfor scientific \u201eanswers\u201f that might be subjected to a linear, one-way process of transfer into \npractice.  While this is a small-scale study, it covers both sides of the divide and a number of \nareas of public policy besides healthcare, and the suggestion from these groups is that pressures \nof performance management and rapid policy turnover mean that what managers and \npolicymakers increasingly want from research is \u201esolutions\u201f to implement\u2014and not a dialogical, \nG.P. Martin et al. (2011) Prospects for knowledge exchange in health policy and management: \ninstitutional and epistemic boundaries. Journal of Health Services Research & Policy 16(4): 211-217 \nDOI: 10.1258\/jhsrp.2011.010132 \nThis is the final draft, after peer-review, of a manuscript published in Journal of Health Services \nResearch & Policy. The definitive version, detailed above, is available online at www.rsmjournals.com. \n9 \ninteractive process of \u201eknowledge intermediation\u201f.(17) \nIn terms of the second question posed in this paper\u2014what might be done to assist the \nproduction of research that can be utilised readily?\u2014it would seem that efforts to increase the \nquantity and quality of exchanges between research and practice face profound challenges, at \nleast in the UK context with its strong performance-management and wider institutional \npressures on both sides of the divide.  The desirability of models of \u201elinkage and exchange\u201f \nbetween research and practice, such as knowledge brokerage(16) and the \u201eorganisational \nexcellence\u201f model of learning from research,(20) is difficult to dispute\u2014at least if we accept that \nevidence is malleable and context-sensitive, and expect our public managers to be reflexive \ndecision-makers rather than rule-following apparatchiks.(7)  The feasibility of these models, \nhowever, seems more questionable.  They face a context in which, according to respondents in \nthis study and others,(21,22) the pressures which deter practitioners and academic researchers \nfrom engaging reflexively are intensifying, and in which demands for health-service managers to \nimplement research evidence that offers clear proof of effectiveness and efficiency are likely to \nredouble.  The responses of a few of the providers in this study seem to suggest that because of \npressures around research performance management, they are eschewing what Boyer called \u201ethe \nscholarship of application\u201f in preference for an all-encompassing focus on carrying out research, \nentrenching the division between producers, commissioners and users.(23)  Efforts to increase \nand enrich the interface between healthcare research and practice, such as CLAHRCs, will need \nto address these deep-seated, structural obstacles to knowledge exchange if they are to do more \nthan reproduce a one-way, instrumental relationship between research and practice, with all the \nlimitations this implies to the potential utility of social research knowledge.  This might require \nstrategies to shift the incentive structures governing the production and dissemination of research \nto \u201ere-couple\u201f the scholarship of research and the scholarship of application.  Such strategies \nmight include more creative contract specifications that give greater emphasis to non-academic \noutputs, or the cultivation of longer-term funding relationships to develop a cyclical bond \nbetween research and dissemination.  By challenging rather than reinforcing providers\u201f \npreoccupation with academic outputs, and consumers\u201f demand for unproblematic research \n\u201eproducts\u201f, such strategies might reconfigure the research-commissioning relationship in a way \nthat is uncomfortable but potentially beneficial for both sides. \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors would like to thank Alison Seymour, who carried out much of the data collection for \nthis study, the participants for their time and views, and Phil Martin and two anonymous \nreviewers for their helpful comments.
