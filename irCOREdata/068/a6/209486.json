Introduction \n \nThis paper is being written in the middle of a visible transformation of the Web from a distributed \nand interconnected information repository to a platform for social networking and content sharing \nand technologies that are collectively referred to as \u2018Web 2.0\u2019. The paper considers this \nphenomenon as a symptom of the direction in which e-Business practices and technologies are \nmoving. \n \nThe paper argues how a decentralized and flexible socio-technical approach can support the \nformation and growth of global production and innovation networks. This is premised on a \nperspective that originated with the economic sociology field and with the embeddedness concept in \neconomic decision-making (Granovetter, 1985), of which Web 2.0 could be seen as a recent \nmanifestation.  It is also premised on the need for more sophisticated technology that can support \nthe distributed coordination of loosely coupled business-to-business (B2B) transactions in \nreconfigurable value networks, thereby preserving local autonomy and avoiding dependence on \ncentralized transaction servers. \n \nThe digital ecosystems initiative is funded by the European Commission but we believe that its \naspects are centrally important in development contexts:  the local autonomy, because it is about \nsocial constructivist understandings of self-determination and the independence, because, by \nempowering individual players, no matter how small, to play in the B2B market at the same level of \nmultinational corporations, it reaches in the electronic B2B space a similar flattening and \ndemocratizing effect to what the Web has already reached in the content sharing space. \n                                                \n1 Corresponding author: p.dini@lse.ac.uk \nSubmitted on 31\/03\/08 to IJTLID\u2019s Special Issue on Global Value Chains and Innovation Networks: Prospects for Industrial \nUpgrading in Developing Countries \n \n2 \n \nSection two briefly looks at the Web 2.0 phenomenon and argues how traditional \nconceptualizations of the exchange of tangible goods and services can be greatly enriched in the \nknowledge economy by loosening the topology of the business interconnections, by extending the \nnotion of \u2018value\u2019, and by opening up the interoperability standards. Section three summarizes the \neconomics of online B2B transactions, with attention to SMEs, to provide an assessment of the \nmarket context. This is followed by an in-depth discussion of the University of Surrey\u2019s distributed \ntransaction model and the implications for the next generation of the underlying peer-to-peer (P2P) \nnetwork architecture. Section four discusses the role of government in promoting an environment \nthat supports innovation and growth in the new spaces of the knowledge economy and Section six \nconcludes. \n \n \n2. Knowledge, value, social ties and interoperability standards \n \nFig. 1 shows how developments in the semantics of information and in the semantics of social \nnetworks appear to be progressing at an ever-increasing pace, mediated by sophisticated \ntechnologies.  Such trends can be altered by unexpected developments, but in this paper we assume \na progression along the lines depicted here. \n \nThis figure is interesting because it suggests that there will be a move from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0 to \nWeb 4.0.  Assuming this linear path of development, this move will happen in the US, India, China, \nand Brazil and the like. The question is whether Europe wants to ride the wave(s) of innovation or \nfollow in their wake. These waves of online innovation are influenced by a powerful connection \nbetween media technology and people, reminiscent of the success of text messaging in mobile \nphones. The Google advertising model was among the first examples to take advantage of this \ncoupling and showed how free content sharing and social relations could be leveraged to drive \nsustainable business models in the traditional sense. But the figure also implies the emerging \nbusiness models that are innovative in their reliance on the value generated by social relations \ndirectly. These are characterized as falling on the boundary between the Exchange Economy and \nthe Gift Economy, such as Open Source, without which most of the Web servers now in operation \nwould not be running. \n \nFig. 1 and the future of the Web are more concerned about what is referred to as \u2018content sharing\u2019. \nThis tends to involve the interactions between individual users and, the business-to-consumer \n(B2C) domain. As information and communication technology (ICT) literacy rises in different \ncountries, sectors and among people, we are likely to see a convergence between content sharing \nand the exchange economy, further strengthening the tendency of the service economy to rely on \nknowledge-intensive services mediated by ICTs. \n \nThis trend is strengthened by Open Source and similar phenomena (Creative Commons,2 sharing of \nunused capital (Benkler, 2004), Community Currencies,3 and so on.), which predate Web 2.0 by at \nleast 10 years but are based on a similar blending of the social and the economic dimensions. Such \ntrends are in the end connected to debates on intellectual property right protection, digital rights \nmanagement, and software patents that are part of conceptualizing new value systems as the basis \nof new business models and as enablers of innovation in the emerging environments of the \nknowledge economy. Let us see how current understandings of the market for digital services \nmeasure up to these emerging trends. \n                                                \n2 http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/  \n3 www.openmoney.org  \nSubmitted on 31\/03\/08 to IJTLID\u2019s Special Issue on Global Value Chains and Innovation Networks: Prospects for Industrial \nUpgrading in Developing Countries \n \n3 \n \n \n \nFig. 1:  Constructive interference between information semantics and social semantics \n \n \nFig. 2 shows a view of the digital market that is more concerned with the provision of services as a \nbusiness model for the provider.4 From this viewpoint economies of scale and technological \nefficiency call for a well-integrated and interoperable platform, for which there is not much \ndifference between citizens as consumers (B2C) and companies as purchasers (B2B). The figure \nalso includes Government as one of three typologies of \u2018end-user\u2019. The difficulty in such a \nframework is that it does not leave room for interactions that do not participate in economic \nproduction processes in the traditional sense, i.e. based on revenue. This well understood model of \neconomic exchange that was well suited to the material economy does not fit the knowledge \neconomy so well. Notice also the fairly linear and synchronous character of the \u2018value chain\u2019 \ndepicted. \n \nThe first step in a \u2018constructive deconstruction\u2019 of this more traditional model is to distribute the \nsource of value from the consumer and the value chain to the whole \u2018value network\u2019 (Allee, 2000): \n \nIt is no longer enough to think of a firm as a member of a closed system subject to uncontrollable outside \nshocks. It is part of a network that produces its own change. So, in analyzing the network all aspects of \nthe network must be included: customers, suppliers, competitors, allies, regulators, complementors and \nany other network players whose presence in the network can influence value creation of the firm. \n(Peppard and Rylander, 2006) \n \nThe second step is to recognize the value of \u2018intangibles\u2019 in business transactions: \n \n                                                \n4 From Ovum study for the UK DTI, 2005, www.ovum.com  \nSubmitted on 31\/03\/08 to IJTLID\u2019s Special Issue on Global Value Chains and Innovation Networks: Prospects for Industrial \nUpgrading in Developing Countries \n \n4 \nInterest in intangibles and corporate transparency has increased as business thinking evolves from \nbureaucratic and mechanistic models to more organic perspectives emerging from biology and living \nsystems theory. \u2026 the basic pattern of organization for business is that of a network of tangible and \nintangibles exchanges. Tangible exchanges equate to flows of energy and matter [in living systems]. \nIntangible exchanges, such as knowledge, point to cognitive processes and intelligence. \u2026 [There] are \nserious attempts to develop new indexes, equations, measures, and analytical approaches for calculating \nknowledge assets and for understanding intangible value creation. All this adds up to a serious attack on \ntraditional accounting and enterprise models that regard only revenue and physical assets as \u201cvaluable,\u201d \nand that regard people as liabilities rather than important resources and investments. (Allee, 2002) \n \nFig. 2: Integrated B2C and B2B service provision framework \n \nThe third step is to come to terms with the fact that, as shown in the perhaps too much simplistic \nand linear depiction of Web evolution in Fig. 1, in the content sharing space of the Web it is \ndifficult to set a price for the direct exchange of information because of the many different social \ninteractions. \n \nThe most successful response so far was indirect revenue models, which predate Web 2.0, also \nknown as \u201crelated revenue models\u201d (Mansell and Steinmueller, 2000: 304). For example, the \nGoogle advertising model is successful precisely because it does not try to charge directly for the \ninformation being exchanged. The Google model creates a coupling with other services that are \nsemantically about the information that is being viewed or shared for free. Revenue is generated \nfrom micro-payments between third parties that do not involve the end-user directly. Even giving \ndue credit to this model, clearly the huge popularity of the new Web 2.0 phenomena such as \nFacebook, Flickr, and the like points to the need to generalize our thinking about value systems \ntoward the social space. \n \nSubmitted on 31\/03\/08 to IJTLID\u2019s Special Issue on Global Value Chains and Innovation Networks: Prospects for Industrial \nUpgrading in Developing Countries \n \n5 \n \nThough the strength of social interactions that the architecture of the Web has enabled is \ncontributing to transforming the content sharing landscape and to a healthy rate of innovation in the \nB2C space, the same cannot be said of the B2B space. Although if we measure innovation by \nmarket size this statement would appear erroneous, given the much greater volume of B2B relative \nto B2C, we mean innovation here in the sense of organizational and cultural change. Willingness \nand ability to change often lead to significant growth in volume in any sector. For example, Sassen \n(2006) argues that the ability of financial markets to embrace global electronic networks in the early \n1990s led to their impressive growth since then, which she contrasts to the damping effect of the \nstrict accountability constraints imposed on NGOs by funding bodies which prevent them from \ncreating cross-country networks of shared knowledge and resources, and therefore also from \nbenefiting from economies of scale. We see the barriers to organizational and cultural change in the \nB2B sector as arising mainly from three factors: \n \n\u2022 Convergence leads to lock-in. The challenge to support business interactions in a distributed \nand heterogeneous environment of differing syntactical service interfaces, semantic service \ndescription languages, and messaging protocols is motivating the larger infrastructure and \nICT providers, at all layers of the stack, to make as large a share of the market as possible \n\u2018interoperable\u2019. Where the market must be shared between a few players, industry standards \nare developed to promote the kind of convergence shown in Fig. 2 (for example Bluetooth). \nWhen convergence is coupled too tightly to business models and market share it leads to \nlock-in, even though lock-in is not a characteristic that emerges only in competitive markets, \nand slows innovation. \n\u2022 Branding formalises lock-in in the public consciousness. When premature lock-in occurs, \nwhich comes from the lag of what current ICT can support relative to the more dynamic \ndemands of business interactions, this leads early entrants in the digital marketplace to \nprotect market share by promoting proprietary standards and recognizable brands. Open \nstandards can offer the consumer an alternative to these well-established brands, thereby \ncreating new market entry opportunities for new players. Adopting open standards may be \nfostered by some form of government intervention (for example the involvement of United \nNations Organisations in business modelling frameworks). In the content sharing space, the \nSemantic Web initiative is about these two points. \n\u2022 Intermediators constitute barriers to emergent and socially-driven business activity. B2B \ninteractions may be strongly influenced and motivated by social phenomena such as small-\nworld networks, family ties, and geographical proximity. In some cases, the need to rely on \nthird-party platforms can limit the formation, range, and complexity of new value chains, \nbusiness collaborations, and business transactions. The ability to support a \u2018Web 2.0 for \nBusiness\u2019 could be beneficial to SMEs. In this segment of the market, government has the \nopportunity to foster opportunities for many open standards to emerge, which may provide a \nbasis for socio-economic developments that are not aligned with the short-term business \nincentives of dominant market incumbents. \n \nThough common standards can protect the ability of new entrants to compete with established \nbrands, and government can help in this regard, the maximum possible theoretical interoperability \nlevel could be defined as making interoperability independent of standards altogether. Although this \nis an unrealistic goal in practical terms and undesirable from the view of socially constructed shared \nlanguages and technologies, it sets a useful limiting case for the more technical aspects of the \ninteroperability debate. As discussed below, this was addressed first through the loose coupling of \nthe Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) of ICT environments and more recently through Digital \nBusiness Ecosystems (DBE) research. DBE research has raised the awareness of the challenge that \nSubmitted on 31\/03\/08 to IJTLID\u2019s Special Issue on Global Value Chains and Innovation Networks: Prospects for Industrial \nUpgrading in Developing Countries \n \n6 \nalso the Semantic Web programme has posed. But the goal of interoperability at all levels, business \ninteractions, content, or anything else, remains worth pursuing. Our research challenges the means \nby which this goal may be gained by encouraging wider interdisciplinary debate that encompasses \nsocial constructivist perspectives on the role of language as a medium of power relationships, and \nfunctionalist arguments and models, which are inspired by how biology has solved this problem. \n \nThis paper, therefore, is concerned with the barriers and opportunities for innovation and economic \ngrowth faced by SMEs in the context of the potential available for \u2018constructive\u2019 and synchronous \nB2B interactions, besides those best characterized as \u2018defensive\u2019 moves by dominant players to \npromote asynchronous measures aimed at intellectual property protection. We leave this to a \nbroader discussion of (open) knowledge and innovation networks (and of the extensive research \nliterature in this area). In this paper we look at some of the implications for the B2B environment of \nopen architectural and design choices for an ICT infrastructure that supports e-Business transactions \nspecifically for SMEs. Though the paper starts to integrate a social science perspective with \ntechnical architecture considerations, it does not discuss or address the influence of biological \nsolutions on the second. \n \nThe Digital Ecosystems initiative5 offers an interesting view of new modes of economic \norganization that aim to leverage loose and dynamic business networks in the online B2B \ninteraction space in a way that is similar to the Web 2.0 content sharing environment. This view \nplaces a premium on the contribution of SMEs to economic growth by their flexibility and ability to \nform loose and dynamic business partnerships in response to changing market conditions. Before \ndiscussing the implications for the technology of such flexible business behaviour we discuss some \neconomic data on the online B2B space. \n \n \n3. Basic Economics of Online B2B Transaction Environments \n \nB2B online transactions or e-commerce have moved out of the early adoption phase and its long-\nterm prospects are strong. In the EU-27, the percentage of enterprises\u2019 total turnover from e-\ncommerce via Internet doubled between 2004 and 2007, passing from 2.1 percent (2004) to 4.2 \npercent (2007) of total turnover (Eurostat, 2007). On average, 15 percent of EU enterprises received \nonline orders in 2007, up from 9 percent in 2003.  Also, online sales by EU enterprises grew on \naverage from 13 percent in 2003 to 27 percent in 2007 (UNCTAD, 2007). In the United States, total \ne-commerce sales for 2007 were estimated at USD 136.4 billion representing a rise of 19 percent \nfrom 2006 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2008). In 2005, B2B explained 92 percent of total e-commerce in \nthe US (U.S. Census Bureau, 2007), while the volume of European B2B online trade raised to \nalmost half of firms\u2019 purchases occurring online (European Commission, 2005). \n \nMost B2B applications of e-commerce are in three areas relative to the different phases and related \nbusiness processes. Transaction preparation applications (pre-sale\/pre-purchase phase) include \nadvertising, catalogues and stock lists, price comparisons, information services\/information about \noffers, and negotiation between seller and buyer. Transaction completion applications \n(sale\/purchase phase) include ordering, billing and payment, finance and delivery. And transaction \nsupport applications (after sale\/purchase phase) include information capture, information \nmanagement, market analysis, market development, guarantee management, credit administration \nand handling returns (EC, 2007; OECD, 2002).  \n \n                                                \n5 www.digital-ecosystems.org  \nSubmitted on 31\/03\/08 to IJTLID\u2019s Special Issue on Global Value Chains and Innovation Networks: Prospects for Industrial \nUpgrading in Developing Countries \n \n7 \nBut e-business is more than just e-commerce. Although higher efficiency of business processes, \ninternally and between trading partners in the value chain, continues to be one of the most important \npromises of e-business because of its direct impact on cost cuts, it is argued that innovative firms \nsee e-business as an opportunity to deliver against key business objectives such as the delivery of \nhigh quality goods and services, high quality management, and marketing for improving customer \nservice (EC, 2007). E-business thus involves business processes in the entire value chain, or value \nnetwork. Firm size matters when talking about e-business. The continuing challenge is to promote \nadapting e-business by SMEs. According to the E-business Watch Survey in 2006 (EC, 2007b), \nthere are roughly 50 SMEs engaged in e-business for every 100 large enterprises. Nordic SMEs are \nthe most engaged but other differences among countries like France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the \nUK are not clear because of the uncertainty in the data.  \n \nFor B2B transactions among SMEs, on average only about 11% of SMEs use software solutions or \ninternet-based services for e-procurement. Moreover, there is a massive gap between the percentage \nof SMEs placing at least some orders online (53% of total) and those that use special software for \nthis (only 11% of total). SMEs without special software place orders mainly through websites or \nextranets of suppliers (EC, 2007b). The result is a lack of digital back-office integration of \nprocurement-related processes among European SMEs. Despite this, the E-business Watch survey \nalso showed that 84% of small companies consider that E-business is an important feature of their \nbusiness operations as compared with 81% of large enterprises that report that this is an important \nfeature.  \n \nEstimating the share of the economy that e-Business explains is difficult because the intensity, \nfocus, and the impact of e-Business vary by business sector and by specific value chain in which an \nenterprise operates. Even so, according to the Eurostat Community Survey on ICT usage in \nenterprises (2007), in most European countries the volume of Internet and other e-commerce \ntransactions6 is rising as a share of total turnover. In 2006, Denmark, the UK, Ireland and France \nwere reported to have the highest shares in Europe, with 17% of enterprise total turnover coming \nfrom e-commerce in Denmark and the UK; and 16% of the total in Ireland and France.  \n \nFor enterprises to have an incentive to adopt e-Business and e-commerce strategies and tools, the \nbenefits must be larger than the investment and maintenance costs of the tools. Public policy is \ndirected to promoting e-business and e-commerce readiness and connectivity, but it also needs to \npromote more mature e-business strategies that integrate internal and external processes. Analysis \nhas shown that technology neutrality is important in fostering these developments (OECD, 2004). \nResearch has shown that cutting the barriers to e-business adoption by promoting interoperable \nsystems, the extension of network infrastructure, and related support services, offers a means of \nraising incentives for adoption. For B2B transactions across European countries (cross-border), it is \nalso clear that reliable trust systems and an adequate legal and regulatory framework are needed.   \n \nThe characteristics of B2B transactions suggest the need for an open infrastructure, that is \ninteroperable and allows enterprises to move freely in the market, thereby avoiding lock-in from \n\u2018principal-agent problems,\u20197 which may arise from market failures like information asymmetries, \nuncertainty and high risk. Policies can encourage these developments, by creating incentives for \nnew entrants in the market through fostering competition and investment in innovative technology \ninfrastructures. The OECD Recommendations of the Council of Broadband Development in 2004 \n                                                \n6 Including proprietary electronic data interchange (EDI).  \n7 The principal-agent problem in economics arises under conditions of incomplete and asymmetric information when a \u2018principal\u2019 \nhires an \u2018agent\u2019. Various mechanisms may be used to try to align the interests of the agent with those of the principal, causing the \nagent to be \u2018locked in\u2019 to the principal.  \nSubmitted on 31\/03\/08 to IJTLID\u2019s Special Issue on Global Value Chains and Innovation Networks: Prospects for Industrial \nUpgrading in Developing Countries \n \n8 \nsuggested that public financing to expand coverage of infrastructure networks to under-served \ngroups (i.e. SMEs), though with little negative effect on competitive market forces, is needed. \n \nAlthough the above argument was hugely controversial at the time and was not supported by clear \nevidence, if adopting a perspective of \u2018global public goods\u2019 for the provision of ICTs and \ninfrastructure networks as suggested during the United Nations\u2019 World Summit on the Information \nSociety (Geneva, December 2003), negative externalities arising from public action can be \ninternalised (Binger, 2003). As explained by Binger (2003), \u201cif the cost associated with a negative \nexternality is effectively attributed to the responsible agent the externality is regarded as \ninternalised\u201d. This approach suggests that governments have to assume responsibility for the \nnegative effects that their own actions might generate and correct them accordingly (Kaul et al., \n1999).  \n \nThe next section presents the latest technological advances developed as part of the digital \necosystems initiative specifically to support dynamic B2B transactions between SMEs interacting \nthrough global production networks. \n \n \n4. Digital Business Ecosystems built on open-standards infrastructure and \ndynamic P2P architecture with local autonomy \n \nThe Digital Business Ecosystem (DBE) is unique because it offers a new approach to modelling \nbusiness standards. Rather than assuming service offerings will converge to a common standard or \npromoting compliance with a centralized data model or architecture, the DBE supports an \nevolutionary approach that helps the dynamic service chains formation to match the business \npartnerships\u2019 flexibility, which can be formed through Web-enabled communication and Web 2.0 \nenvironments. The technical implications of such a vision are considerable, but they offer the \npotential for the Digital Ecosystems approach to deliver a disruptive innovation that could challenge \nthe leading players in the market. \n \nCurrent implementations of Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA) for addressing B2B \nrequirements tend to underestimate the negative impact of the new unique proprietary functional \nmodels. In many cases efforts to ask competing businesses to use a unique data schema, or service \nmodel, proved unsuccessful, as competing standards cannot be enforced even when they were \ndefined by a government or by a standards body. There are complex mechanisms that motivate ICT \nand business communities to adopt some standards that may become de-facto standards. \u2018Good\u2019 \nstandards do not always emerge from competition and current implementations of SOA are \nunsatisfactory because they can be shown to violate important principles. \n \nFor example, the goal of Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) is to enable applications from \ndifferent providers to be offered as services that can be used, composed and coordinated in a \nloosely-coupled way (Papazoglou, 2003). This is the predominant computing paradigm in a digital \nbusiness ecosystem. In this paradigm each participant in the B2B space does not need to expose the \ndetails of its internal workflows and business models as this model requires only that it present a \nservice interface. The architectural approach of SOC is called SOA (Papazoglou et al., 2006) and it \nis applicable when many distributed applications are running on various technologies and when \ndifferent platforms need to communicate with each other. SOA offers the promise of keeping full \nlocal autonomy for participants (i.e. loosely coupled such that their local state is invisible). \n \nBut, current Web Service protocols violate the SOA principle. This violation was justified as \nSubmitted on 31\/03\/08 to IJTLID\u2019s Special Issue on Global Value Chains and Innovation Networks: Prospects for Industrial \nUpgrading in Developing Countries \n \n9 \nproviding for safe recovery of aborted transactions (WS-BusinessActivity, 2004), but it is also the \ncase that, until recently, the technology was unavailable to support a loosely coupled architecture. \nDigital Ecosystems research shows that loose coupling is now within reach (Razavi et al., 2007b,c), \nalthough further research is needed to consolidate work in this area and to develop proper standards \nthat will have a strong chance of being adopted. We argue that this chance will be strengthened if \nthe potential for spontaneous adoption is complemented by government intervention aimed at \npromoting this alternative market interaction mechanism. \n \nBusiness transactions in a B2B context usually involve interactions between many partners, either \nservice providers, or service consumers, or both. These interactions require partners to behave to \nsome extent in a coordinated way\u2014partners must follow an agreed protocol to execute transactions  \n(Razavi et al., 2007a). A B2B transaction between SMEs in a digital ecosystem may involve simple \nusage of a web service or composition of several services from various service providers. A \nbusiness transaction may be finished over a period of minutes, hours, or even days\u2014thus the term \nlong-lived or long-running transaction. Executing a long-running transaction corresponds to \nconducting a business and often comprises several sub-transactions that involve many underlying \nservices. \n \nCurrent implementations of transaction support in distributed e-Business environments rely on a \ncentralized transaction server. This is mainly because the orchestration and composition of separate \nservices that cooperate in the delivery of a complex workflow is difficult to reach, so a centralized \nsolution was the only possibility until recently. In contrast, Digital Ecosystems research is \ndeveloping the concept, formal model, architecture, and implementation for a distributed \ntransaction management system. This system relies on Local Coordinators, one for each service, \nwith a specification derived from a workflow model.  The Local Coordinators act independently of \none another to guarantee (local) consistency and recovery support across all the transactions in a \ncomplex workflow representing a business process.  \n \nA Digital Ecosystem is able to ensure local autonomy and loose coupling because it relies on a \ndistributed rather than on a centralized transaction manager. It is important to realize that in the \nDigital Ecosystems distributed transaction model rollback recovery does not imply that the model is \nstateful.8 Since there is no central server, the information about the previous state can only be stored \non the servers of the participating SMEs, who own this information. The Local Coordinators can \nonly flag a failed step in the transaction and roll back to the previous stage (not state), where the \ninformation about the previous state is requested again from the same participating SMEs. So, the \nDigital Ecosystems distributed transaction model is stateless and compatible with the SOA \nprinciples. A Digital Ecosystem integrates a distributed agent architecture with a distributed Web \nService architecture, thereby reaching a true SOA. Figure 3 shows the complexity of a DBE, \nsuggesting how the dynamic system services in the Digital Ecosystem mirrors the dynamic system \nof social networks and business partnerships. \n \nA business network enables networked firms to engage in distributed business transactions and to \nrealize their business goals. The Digital Ecosystem provides support for B2B interactions between \nSMEs in a fully distributed way (no central point of control for transaction or network operations), \nand offers a consistent model for performing transactions. The model must be highly resistant to \nfragmentation\u2014a situation where the network gets divided into smaller isolated networks\u2014as this \nmay inhibit collaborative business interactions. It must also be designed to cut the risk of failure at \n                                                \n8 In computer science, \u2018stateless\u2019 refers to a system or protocol that does not keep a persistent state between transactions. A stateless \nserver is a server that treats each request as an independent transaction that is unrelated to any previous request. \u2018Stateful\u2019 is the \nopposite of stateless. http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stateless_server  \nSubmitted on 31\/03\/08 to IJTLID\u2019s Special Issue on Global Value Chains and Innovation Networks: Prospects for Industrial \nUpgrading in Developing Countries \n \n10 \nthe transaction level.  Transaction recovery must be supported by a procedure and must be helped \nby the underlying network that must support the choice of alternative paths\/scenarios of transaction \nexecution. \n \nIn the DBE, rather than having one service provider (like Google), there are thousands of them.  In \ncontrast to Google that has many regular servers around the world (which are not transaction \nservers), the DBE supports B2B transactions while respecting SOA principles and the local \nautonomy of businesses engaged in transactions. The aim of DBE research is to develop a \ndistributed coordination framework for long-lived transactions using a P2P architecture. \n \nIn the DBE architecture, not only does the network propagate traffic smartly, but also each \u2018virtual \nserver\u2019 or \u2018virtual super-peer\u2019 is formed by a collection of servers cooperating to provide the \nfunctionality of one server in a reliable and flexible way that is not feasible when a centralized \nserver is used. Servers in the P2P network are elected to become members of a virtual super-peer \ncluster by their availability to share resources and by their recent history of reliability. By the same \ntoken, they can be downgraded to regular peers if their reliability or availability decreases. In either \ncase, it is foundational in the architecture that the peer remains unaware that a change in its status \nhas occurred; similarly, the members of a virtual super-peer cannot belong to the same \norganization. In this way the functional concerns for quality and reliability of service, which require \na hierarchical network topology, were decoupled from any aggregation or centralization of power or \ncontrol, which an architecture that is merely functionally optimized could (wittingly or unwittingly) \nsupport. It is also relevant to point out that a centralized solution cannot easily compete with a \ndecentralized or distributed solution on a cost basis. A centralized solution cannot be regionally \ncustomized and cannot adapt to peak-time traffic congestion by using localized propagation \nmodels\u2014because it is centralized. \n \n \n \nFig. 3: Digital Business Ecosystem as a mediating SOA for e-Business \nSubmitted on 31\/03\/08 to IJTLID\u2019s Special Issue on Global Value Chains and Innovation Networks: Prospects for Industrial \nUpgrading in Developing Countries \n \n11 \n \n \nThese discussions of network dynamics, topology, efficiency, and costs mirror the challenge of \nunderstanding the interaction between organizational forms, decentralized decision processes and \ninformation technology, and their effects on organizational performance, efficient operations, and \ndecision-making in different business settings (Galbraith, 1977; Mintzberg, 1978; Burgelman, \n1988; Huber, 1990). There are other considerations relevant to this discussion, such as decentralized \norganizational configurations (Galbraith: 1994, 1995), intense use of new communication \ntechnologies (Bettis and Hitt, 1995; Fulk and De Sanctis, 1995), and intensified competition across \nindustries (D\u2019Aveni, 1994; Thomas, 1996). The main point, however, is the greater ease with which \nsmaller companies can react to changes in the economy, and the role ICTs can play in easing \nchange. Andersen and Segars (2001) show that computer networks can provide decentralized \ndecision makers with instantaneous access to relevant information, which will speed up the \ndecision-making process, compared with formal approvals moving along several hierarchical layers \nauthority, where information overload can inhibit timely decisions (Minzberg, 1992).  \n \nIn this respect, SMEs do not suffer from centralized authority, and their flatter organizational \nstructure offers flexibility for changing strategies in a short time, but the challenge is to enable them \nto interact through flexible and dynamic networks that can support business interactions. It is \nimportant to mention that any fragmentation of the ICT network can stop the organizational \nadvantages of such dynamic, distributed, and loosely organized global production networks. These \nare precisely the concerns addressed by Digital Ecosystems research. So, the flexibility and \nresilience of Digital Ecosystems viewed as systems integrator of business, social and ICT networks \nwould seem to enable the economy to benefit from the greater flexibility of SMEs without suffering \nfrom their greater vulnerability to market fluctuations and with lower transaction costs than \nexperienced through \u2018state-of-the-art\u2019 centralized servers. \n \nIn short, in a Digital Business Ecosystem SMEs have the opportunity to: \n\u2022 Maintain local autonomy \n\u2022 Avoid dependence on a centralized server (provided by a large enterprise which is then likely \nto promote its own model or standard) \n\u2022 Access a customized infrastructure that can cope with the dynamics of their local environment \nand adapt to changes quickly. \n\u2022 Avoid network fragmentation and loss of partners because of hacker attacks, server failure, etc. \n\u2022 Benefit from the diversity of their environment and avoid unexpected peaks in traffic (a risk \nfor centralized super-peers). The dynamic and unpredictable character of the SME \nenvironment means that traffic propagation cannot easily be predicted and static super-peers \ncannot cope with unpredictable peaks in traffic loads without a wasteful investment in \nresources to ensure against unpredictable peaks and congestion. \n \nAs a continuation of the DBE work, the OPAALS project is investigating an integrated architecture \nfor business interactions and content sharing that is consistent with the social science arguments and \ntechnical principles outlined above. Fig. 4 shows a high-level view of the open-standards \narchitecture being developed and put into effect in the OPAALS project (www.opaals.org). \n \nSubmitted on 31\/03\/08 to IJTLID\u2019s Special Issue on Global Value Chains and Innovation Networks: Prospects for Industrial \nUpgrading in Developing Countries \n \n12 \n \nFig. 4: Technology vision of Digital Ecosystems being pursued in the OPAALS project \n \n \nThe Role of Government \n \nLessig (2006) argues that as economies change from manufacturing to service and now knowledge \neconomies, legislative frameworks are unable to keep up with these developments and that there is \na need for new forms of market intervention. For example, the anti-trust proceedings in Europe \nagainst Microsoft have taken 10 years before requiring this player to pay a fine of 340m Euro for its \nunfair market dominance. During this time the online media industry has undergone a revolution \nwith Google, My Space, Facebook, Skype, e-Bay, You Tube, and others emerging and reaching \ndominant market positions in various \u2018sectors\u2019 of the Web. Although it could be argued these \ndevelopments signify healthy innovation in line with Schumpeterian forces of creative destruction \nin \u2018Fast-Forward\u2019 mode as large companies overtake each other in a frenzy of market expansion \nconsistent with the emerging Knowledge Economy, it can also be argued that there are high risks \nfor latecomers. \n \nHistorical evidence suggests that early entrants such as those referred above seek to claim as much \nterritory or market share as possible through a variety of lock-in strategies, and then charge \neconomic rents to the latecomers. Historically, this led to government intervention to foster \nminimum standards of fairness on competition in the marketplace.  In interactive Web \ndevelopments and P2P networks, social networks are enabling trust and reputation mechanisms to \nsupport content sharing spaces. But in the B2B space SMEs are disadvantaged by features of a \ndigital divide, because of their small scale and the absence of incentives for coordinated action that \nwould enable them to reach efficiency and competitiveness. \n \nAlternatives to the present system of economic rents from technical knowledge asymmetries created \nby complex patenting and licensing systems which were put in place since the beginning of the PC \nrevolution are difficult to develop. This is partly because the norms and precedents on proprietary \nstandards have become so familiar: we are so used to digital technologies being owned by others \nthat we do not notice to what extent how we work, think, and communicate is influenced by how \nthese technologies are designed and regulated. The temptation is to regard the market arrangements \nfor digital technologies and services, as a given. \nSubmitted on 31\/03\/08 to IJTLID\u2019s Special Issue on Global Value Chains and Innovation Networks: Prospects for Industrial \nUpgrading in Developing Countries \n \n13 \n \nIn Digital Ecosystems research, technology is regarded as an extension of our language, and \nlanguage as the medium of social construction. In this context, the structure and development of \nB2B e-commerce and e-business markets are not predetermined. This opens the possibility of \nraising the question about the best economic model that will be most advantageous for SMEs. In \nshort, Digital Ecosystems research asks whether it is proper for someone, anyone, to own our \nlanguage, and, therefore, a key aspect of constructing knowledge economies. So far as the answer is \nthat open standards offer an alternative to the centralized server architectures that are available in \nthe market, there is a case for government support for such an alternative. \n \nGovernment support for open standards is an example of an indirect and light-touch way to \nstrengthen the chances of success of new entrants in a market characterized by the dominance of \nlarge firms, thereby encouraging greater innovation potential. In the digital technology sector, there \nare some proprietary platforms through which SMEs must conduct all their online business \ntransactions. Today in Europe this is the only entry point to the knowledge economy for millions of \nSMEs (20 million in the EU25). Clearly, there is a need to look at how this market environment \noperates and the extent to which SMEs are being disadvantaged. \n \n \n5. Conclusion \n \nThe aim of the Digital Ecosystems approach is to develop structural, architectural, and regulatory \nmeasures that can enable new entry in the face of the advantages enjoyed by dominant large firms \nthat can exploit substantial economies of scale and scope in the B2B e-business marketplace.  The \nDigital Ecosystems approach offers a means for protecting open innovation environments and for \nenhancing the potential for greater inclusion of SMEs in the emerging knowledge economy with the \nexpected benefit that these firms will contribute more effectively to a dynamic marketplace and to \nsustainable economic growth. In the setting of intensified globalization, we believe that this \napproach can support global production networks as a more inclusive and participatory industrial \norganization model, creating positive effects for innovation and economic growth. \n \n \nAcknowledgement \n \nThe authors gratefully acknowledge valuable feedback at various stages in the writing of this article \nfrom Mr Allan Mayo of the Department of Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform of the UK \nGovernment.
