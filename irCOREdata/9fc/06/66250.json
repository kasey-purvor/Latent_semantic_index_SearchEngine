By controllably accelerating the potential, we show quantum\naccelerator mode dynamics to be highly sensitive to the effective gravitational acceleration when this is close to\nspecific, resonant values. This quantum sensitivity to a control parameter is reminiscent of that associated with\nclassical chaos, and promises techniques for precision measurement.\nPACS numbers: 05.45.Mt, 03.65.Sq, 32.80.Lg, 42.50.Vk\nThe identification and observation of signatures of chaos in\nquantum dynamics is the goal of considerable current effort.\nMuch of this work centers on the theoretical definition and\ncharacterization of energy spectra [1], or such quantities as\nthe Loschmidt echo [2] and fidelity [3], which essentially de-\nvelop the idea that sensitivity of a wavefunction\u2019s evolution to\nsmall variations in a system\u2019s Hamiltonian be used as a defini-\ntion of quantum instability [1, 2, 3, 4]. Such quantities could\nbe observed experimentally but require some interpretation to\nhighlight the way in which their nature betokens stability or\nchaos. An attractive alternative would be the observation of\ndifferent motional regimes. This is more in sympathy with\nthe techniques and philosophy used to identify classical chaos,\nand is the approach used here.\nIn certain systems the decay of the overlap of two ini-\ntially identical wavefunctions evolving under slightly differing\nHamiltonians can be expressed in the long time limit as the\nsum of two decay predictions, governed by Fermi\u2019s Golden\nRule and the classical Lyapunov exponent [2]. The decay\nrate serves as a quantum signature of instability, which can\nbe compared with that of the corresponding classical system.\nSuch sensitivity can be probed by interferometric techniques\n[5, 6]. In the quantum-mechanical system presented here, the\nclassical limit of which is chaotic, extreme sensitivity of the\nqualitative nature of the motional dynamics to a control pa-\nrameter is directly observable. It is manifested by the effect on\nquantum accelerator mode (QAM) dynamics [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\nof small variations in the effective value of gravity in the \u03b4-\nkicked accelerator [7], an extension of the paradigmatic \u03b4-\nkicked rotor [11]. The QAM observed in this atom optical\nrealization [6, 7, 8, 9, 10], are characterized by a momentum\ntransfer, linear with kick number, to a substantial fraction (up\nto \u223c 20%) of the initial cloud of atoms. This is due to a reso-\nnant rephasing effect, dependent on the time-interval between\nkicks, for certain initial wavefunctions [9, 12]. The sensitiv-\nity in the dynamics we observe also promises the capability\nof precisely calibrating a relationship between the local grav-\nitational acceleration and h\/m, where m is the atomic mass,\nand we describe how our observations constitute a prelimi-\nnary feasibility-demonstration of such a measurement.\nThe Hamiltonian of the \u03b4-kicked accelerator, realized using\na magneto-optic trap (MOT) of laser-cooled atoms that are\nthen released and subjected to pulses from a standing wave of\noff-resonant light, is\n\u02c6H =\np\u02c62\n2m\n+ mgz\u02c6 \u2212 ~\u03c6d[1 + cos(Gz\u02c6)]\n+\u221e\u2211\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\u03b4(t \u2212 nT ), (1)\nwhere z\u02c6 is the position, p\u02c6 the momentum, m the particle mass,\nt the time, T the pulse period, ~\u03c6d quantifies the strength of the\nkicking potential, G = 2\u03c0\/\u03bbspat, and \u03bbspat is the spatial period\nof the standing wave applied to the atoms. The quantity g is\nnormally the gravitational acceleration. However, by \u2018acceler-\nating\u2019 the standing wave, it is possible to effectively modify g.\nWe have previously used this technique to counteract gravity\nand regain kicked rotor dynamics [7, 13].\nIn an innovative analysis by Fishman, Guarneri, and Re-\nbuzzini (FGR) [12], the fact that QAM are observed only\nwhen T approaches \u2113T1\/2 = \u21132\u03c0m\/~G2, where \u2113 \u2208 Z+ and\nT1\/2 is the half-Talbot time [9], is exploited to yield a dra-\nmatically simplified picture of QAM dynamics. In a frame\naccelerating with g, the linear potential is removed to leave a\nspatially periodic Hamiltonian. The quasimomentum \u03b2 is then\nconserved, i.e., if a momentum state |p\u3009 = |(k + \u03b2)~G\u3009, where\nk \u2208 Z and \u03b2 \u2208 [0, 1), \u2018ladders\u2019 of momentum states of dif-\nferent \u03b2 evolve independently. The resulting n-dependent and\n\u03b2-specific kick-to-kick time evolution operator is\n\u02c6Fn(\u03b2) = exp(\u2212i{\u03c1\u02c6 + sgn(\u01eb)[\u03c0\u2113 + k\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3(n \u2212 1\/2)]}2\/2\u01eb)\n\u00d7 exp(i\u02dck cos \u03c7\u02c6\/|\u01eb|), (2)\nwhere \u02dck = |\u01eb|\u03c6d, k = 2\u03c0T\/T1\/2, and \u03b3 = gGT 2. We have in-\ntroduced a smallness parameter, \u01eb = 2\u03c0(T\/T1\/2 \u2212 \u2113), to quan-\ntify the closeness of T to \u2113T1\/2 and the dynamical variables\nare now an angle \u03c7\u02c6 = Gz\u02c6 and a discrete conjugate momen-\ntum \u03c1\u02c6 = p\u02c6|\u01eb|\/~G, such that [\u03c7\u02c6, \u03c1\u02c6] = i|\u01eb|. If one constructs a\nkick-to-kick Heisenberg map corresponding to Eq. (2) for the\ndynamical variables, then in the limit \u01eb \u2192 0, the commutator\nvanishes along with the uncertainty principle, and the opera-\ntors can be replaced by their mean values. Thus\n\u03c1\u02dcn+1 = \u03c1\u02dcn \u2212 \u02dck sin(\u03c7n) \u2212 sgn(\u01eb)\u03b3, (3a)\n\u03c7n+1 = \u03c7n + sgn(\u01eb)\u03c1\u02dcn+1, (3b)\n2FIG. 1: Phase space plots produced by Eq. (3), when 2\u03c0\u03b3\/k2 =\n1\/1 \u21d2 \u03b3 = (2\u03c0 + \u01eb)2\/2\u03c0, and \u02dck = |\u01eb|0.8\u03c0 for (a) \u01eb = \u22120.88,\n(b) \u01eb = \u22120.02, (c) \u01eb = 0.03, (d) \u01eb = 0.6. This corresponds to\nT = 57.4 \u00b5s, 66.5 \u00b5s, 67 \u00b5s, 73 \u00b5s. For (a), (b) the island corresponds\nto a (p, j) = (1, 1) QAM, and for (c), (d), to a (p, j) = (1,\u22121) QAM.\nwhere \u03b8n = \u3008\u02c6\u03b8n\u3009 and \u03c1\u02dcn = \u3008\u03c1\u02c6n\u3009 + sgn[\u03c0\u2113 + k\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3(n \u2212 1\/2)].\nQuantum accelerator modes are one-to-one related to stable\nperiodic orbits of this map [6, 8, 12]. It is very important to\nnote that \u01eb \u2192 0 coincides with ~ \u2192 0 only if \u2113 = 0. Oth-\nerwise, as in the experiments here, the classical-particle-like\nbehavior of QAM is due to a quantum resonance effect.\nThe stable periodic orbits yielded by Eq. (3) (and hence\nQAM) are classified by their order p and jumping index j (the\nnumber of momentum units, in terms of the size of the phase-\nspace cell, traversed after p iterations). The sign of j is deter-\nmined by whether this is in the positive or negative momen-\ntum direction. A necessary condition [12] for the existence of\na periodic orbit is |j\/p + sgn(\u01eb)\u03b3\/2\u03c0| \u2264 \u02dck\/2\u03c0, which can be\nrewritten (for small \u01eb) as\n\u2212|\u01eb|\n(\n\u03c6d\n2\u03c0\n+\n2\u2113\u03b3\nk2\n)\n\u2264\nj\np\n+ sgn(\u01eb)2\u03c0\u21132 \u03b3\nk2\n\u2264 |\u01eb|\n(\n\u03c6d\n2\u03c0\n\u2212\n2\u2113\u03b3\nk2\n)\n. (4)\nBoth \u03c6d and \u03b3\/k2 = gm2\/~2G3 are independent of T , and\ntherefore of \u01eb. Equation (4) is convenient when T is varied\nfrom just below to just above \u2113T1\/2, i.e., scanning \u01eb from neg-\native to positive, as in the experiments described here. As\n\u01eb \u2192 0, the QAM that occur must be characterized by j and\np such that j\/p \u2192 \u2212sgn(\u01eb)2\u03c0\u21132\u03b3\/k2. In general 2\u03c0\u21132\u03b3\/k2 is\nan irrational value, and one usually observes a succession of\nincreasingly high-order QAM as T \u2192 \u2113T1\/2 [8]. If we tune\ng so that 2\u03c0\u21132\u03b3\/k2 = r\/s, where r and s are integers, then\nj\/p+ sgn(\u01eb)2\u03c0\u21132\u03b3\/k2 = 0 for j\/p = \u2212sgn(\u01eb)r\/s. Once the (p, j)\nQAM satisfying this condition appears, shifting T closer to\n\u2113T1\/2 does not result in higher-order QAM.\nIn a frame accelerating with g, the momentum after N\nkicks, for an initial condition near a (p, j) stable periodic orbit\n[12], in \u2018grating recoils\u2019 ~G [9] is\nqN \u2243 q0 + N\n2\u03c0\n|\u01eb|\n[\nj\np\n+ sgn(\u01eb) \u03b3\n2\u03c0\n]\n, (5)\nwhere q0 is the initial momentum. For N a multiple of j, this\nresult is exact for \u01eb-classical initial conditions located on (p, j)\nperiodic orbits. We now consider the momentum of orbits\nspecified by j\/p = r\/s (for \u01eb < 0) and j\/p = \u2212r\/s (for \u01eb > 0)\nas a single function of N and \u01eb, in the case where 2\u03c0\u21132\u03b3\/k2\napproaches rational values. Letting 2\u03c0\u21132\u03b3\/k2 = r\/s + w\u21132\n[14], we find:\nqN \u2243 q0 + N\nr\ns\n(\n2\n\u2113\n+\n\u01eb\n2\u03c0\u21132\n)\n+ Nw\n(\n2\u03c0\u21132\n\u01eb\n+ 2\u2113 + \u01eb\n2\u03c0\n)\n. (6)\nScanning through \u01eb from negative to positive values, one does\nnot generally observe two QAM of the same p and magnitude\nof j (with positive sign for negative \u01eb, and negative sign for\npositive \u01eb) [8, 15]. However, in the gravity-resonant cases we\nconsider, when 2\u03c0\u21132\u03b3\/k2 is close to r\/s, we always observe\nan r\/s and then a \u2212r\/s QAM as we scan \u01eb in this way. This\nis shown in Fig. 1, where we plot Poincare\u00b4 sections produced\nby Eq. (3) for \u03b3 = k2\/2\u03c0 = (2\u03c0 + \u01eb)2\/2\u03c0 (i.e., r\/s = 1) and\n\u02dck = |\u01eb|\u03c6d = |\u01eb|0.8\u03c0 (the approximate experimental mean value\n[7]). The islands around the (p, j) = (1,\u2212sgn(\u01eb)1) periodic\norbits remain large over a wide range of \u01eb and, in dramatic\ncontrast to Ref. [8], no higher-order island structures appear\nas \u01eb \u2192 0. In Fig. 2(a) the corresponding QAM are similarly\nrobust and uninterrupted by higher-order QAM as T \u2192 T1\/2.\nFrom Eq. (6) we thus see that for a given N, q is a linear\nfunction of \u01eb whenever w = 0. If w , 0 this changes to a\nhyperbolic function of \u01eb, where the arms of the hyperbolae\npoint in opposite directions for oppositely signed w. Devi-\nation from straight line behavior in a QAM accelerated to a\ngiven momentum will be greater for a gravity-resonant mode\ncorresponding to a smaller value of j\/p = r\/s. This is because\nthe acceleration of the mode is \u221d j\/p, but the deviation is \u221d N.\nWe consider only QAM where j = r = 1, so high-order modes\nexhibit, for a given momentum transfer, greater sensitivity to\nvariations in g than low-order modes.\nIn our realization of the quantum \u03b4-kicked accelerator,\n\u223c 107 cesium atoms are trapped and cooled in a MOT to a\ntemperature of 5\u00b5K, yielding a Gaussian momentum distribu-\ntion with FWHM 6~G. The atoms are then released and ex-\nposed to a sequence of equally spaced pulses from a standing\nwave of higher intensity light 15 GHz red-detuned from the\n62S 1\/2 \u2192 62P1\/2, (F = 4 \u2192 F\u2032 = 3) D1 transition. Hence\nthe spatial period of the standing wave is \u03bbspat = 447 nm, and\nT1\/2 = 66.7\u00b5s. The peak intensity in the standing wave is\n\u2243 5 \u00d7 104 mW\/cm2, and the pulse duration is tp = 500 ns.\nThis is sufficiently short that the atoms are in the Raman-\nNath regime and hence each pulse is a good approximation\nto a \u03b4-function kick. The potential depth is quantified by\n\u03c6d = \u2126\n2tp\/8\u03b4L, where \u2126 is the Rabi frequency and \u03b4L the\ndetuning from the D1 transition. During the pulse sequence, a\nvoltage-controlled crystal phase modulator is used to strobo-\n3FIG. 2: (color online). Color density plots of experimental momentum distributions for different effective gravity g corresponding to (a)\nr\/s = 1\/1 (after 15 kicks), (b) r\/s = 1\/2 (30 kicks), (c) r\/s = 1\/3 (45 kicks), and (d) r\/s = 1\/4 (60 kicks), as T is varied in the vicinity of\nthe half Talbot time T1\/2 = 66.7 \u00b5s, from 60.5 \u00b5s to 74.5 \u00b5s in steps of 0.128 \u00b5s. In each case the QAM corresponds to j\/p = r\/s; subplot (i)\ncorresponds to w \u2243 \u22128.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 (deviation from resonant g is \u223c \u22128.6 \u00d7 10\u22122 ms\u22122), subplot (ii) to w \u2243 0, and subplot (iii) to w \u2243 8.5 \u00d7 10\u22124\n(deviation from resonant g is \u223c 8.6 \u00d7 10\u22122 ms\u22122). Overlaid lines, labeled (p, j), indicate QAM momenta predicted by Eq. (6). Population\narbitrarily normalized to maximum value = 1, and momentum defined in a frame falling with g. Note the significantly greater population at\nhigh momentum (up to 50~G) near T1\/2 in (d.i) and (d.iii), compared to (a.i) and (a.iii).\nscopically accelerate the standing wave profile. The atoms\ntherefore effectively experience a non-standard, and control-\nlable, value of gravity. After the pulsing sequence, the atoms\nfall through a sheet of laser light resonant with the 62S 1\/2 \u2192\n62P3\/2, (F = 4 \u2192 F\u2032\u2032 = 5) D2 transition, 0.5 m below the\nMOT. By monitoring the absorption, the atoms\u2019 momentum\ndistribution is then measured by a time-of-flight method, with\nresolution ~G. For further details see Refs. [7, 9].\nIn Fig. 2 we show momentum distributions for experiments\nin which the value of T was scanned around T1\/2 (\u2113 = 1)\nfrom 60.5\u00b5s to 74.5\u00b5s, with 2\u03c0\u03b3\/k2 varied in the vicinity of\nr\/s equal to (a) 1\/1, (b) 1\/2, (c) 1\/3, and (d) 1\/4. To main-\ntain the ideal (w = 0) total momentum transfer, 15, 30, 45\nand 60 kicks were applied, respectively, fixing Nr\/s. For each\nof Figs. 2(a), 2(b), 2(c), and 2(d) the data displayed are: in\nsubplot (ii), from experiments in which 2\u03c0\u03b3\/k2 = r\/s is ful-\nfilled as exactly as feasible, yielding linear variation of the\nQAM momentum with T ; and in subplots (i) and (iii), for\nequal positive and negative deviations, respectively, from this\nnear-ideality, yielding hyperbolic variation of the QAM mo-\nmentum. Typically \u223c 10\u201320 % of the atoms are accelerated\naway from the cloud centered at p = 0.\nIn each subplot (ii) of Fig. 2, the QAM momentum pre-\ndicted by Eq. (6), shown as an overlaid line, is identical. The\n4expected linear dependence on T appears to be well confirmed\nby the data, although the separation of the QAM from the\nmain, non-accelerated cloud, centered at zero momentum, is\nclearer for smaller s = p (there is less momentum diffusion\nof the main cloud due to the smaller number of kicks). The\neffect of imperfectly resonant gravity, shown in subplots (i)\nand (iii) in Fig. 2, is much more dramatic for larger s = p, for\nwhich more kicks are applied. In Fig. 2(a), subplots (i) and\n(iii) are barely distinguishable from subplot (ii), whereas in\nFig. 2(d), the momentum distributions in subplots (i) and (iii)\nare highly asymmetric compared with subplot (ii), with, close\nto T1\/2, noticeable population at up to 50~G. The asymmetry\ninverts as one changes from below [subplot (i)] to above [sub-\nplot (iii)] the resonant value of gravity. We therefore observe\na clear qualitative change in the QAM dynamics, highly sen-\nsitive to a control parameter. The displayed predictions of Eq.\n(6) show that deviations from linear behavior only occur when\nvery close to T1\/2 in Figs. 2(a.i) and 2(a.iii), but are much more\nsignificant in Figs. 2(d.i) and 2(d.iii). This is due to the larger\nnumber of kicks necessary for large s = p to achieve the same\nQAM momentum.\nThe procedure of determining the \u2018standing wave acceler-\nation\u2019 at which straight-line behavior of a given (p, j) QAM\nmomentum is observed as a function of T could, in principle,\nbe used as a sensitive atom-optical means of relating h\/m [16]\nto the local gravitational acceleration [17]. This is because\n2\u03c0\u21132\u03b3\/k2 = r\/s can be rephrased as g = (h\/m)2(r\/s)\u03bb3spat and\nwould be determined by noting when the total acceleration\n(sinusoidal potential plus gravitational) causes these equali-\nties to be fulfilled for a known r\/s, and then subtracting the\nimposed acceleration of the potential. In our setup, where the\nsinusoidal potential is \u2018accelerated\u2019 by using a crystal phase\nmodulator to phase-shift the retroreflected laser beam [7, 9],\nthe value of the phase shift due to a particular applied volt-\nage is difficult to calibrate more precisely than \u223c 1 %. This\naccordingly limits our measured precision of the relationship\nbetween the local gravitational acceleration and h\/m to \u223c 1 %.\nAccurate prediction of the QAM momenta for imperfectly res-\nonant values of the effective gravity, as displayed in Fig. 2, is\nalso hampered. This could be improved by a configuration in\nwhich a moving sinusoidal potential is formed by two coun-\nterpropagating beams with a controllable frequency difference\n[18], where calibration of the phase shift to between 1ppm and\n1ppb is possible. Calibration of \u03bbspat to less than 1ppb is also\nfeasible [17], allowing for the possible sensitive determina-\ntion of either the local gravitational acceleration [17] or h\/m\n[16], depending on which is known more precisely at the out-\nset. The feasibility of any such scheme will ultimately depend\non how precisely the atomic ensemble\u2019s dynamics permit the\ndetermination of the acceleration of the sinusoidal potential\nfor which the resonant, linear with T , behavior of the QAM\noccurs. Ascertaining this will require substantial theoretical\nand experimental investigation.\nIn conclusion, we have observed qualitative changes in the\nmotional quantum dynamics of cold cesium atoms, which are\nhighly sensitive to the precise value of an externally adjustable\nparameter, the effective gravity. This is distinct from concep-\ntually related proposals that consider slightly differing Hamil-\ntonians to study the Loschmidt echo or fidelity, and demon-\nstrates an attractive link to the concepts of highly sensitive dy-\nnamics in classically chaotic systems. Furthermore, we have\ndescribed a feasible experimental scheme taking advantage of\nthis sensitivity to determine a relationship between the local\ngravitational acceleration and h\/m.\nWe thank K.
