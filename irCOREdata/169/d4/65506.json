Neither RCTs nor cohort studies\nsuggested increased risk of cancer with a higher intake of\nomega 3 (trials: 1.07, 0.88 to 1.30; cohort studies: 1.02, 0.87 to\n1.19), but clinically important harm could not be excluded.\nConclusion Long chain and shorter chain omega 3 fats do not\nhave a clear effect on total mortality, combined cardiovascular\nevents, or cancer.\nIntroduction\nConsumption of long chain omega 3 fatty acids (eicosapentae-\nnoic acid (EPA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), and docosahexae-\nnoic acid (DHA)) found in fatty fish and fish oils has been linked\nto the low incidence of coronary heart disease in the Inuit peo-\nple of Greenland1; \u0001 linolenic acid (ALA), a shorter chain omega\n3 found in some plant oils (and variably converted to eicosapen-\ntaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid) may also be protective.2\nOmega 3 fats may protect against cardiovascular disease by low-\nering blood pressure and heart rate; reducing serum\ntriglycerides, thrombotic tendency, inflammation, and arrhyth-\nmias; and improving endothelial function, insulin sensitivity,\nparaoxonase concentrations, and plaque stability.3\u20136\nToxic compounds, such as fat soluble methylmercury,\ndioxins, and polychlorinated biphenyls, are also found in oily fish\nand fish oils, but any harm from these compounds would be seen\nonly after long term supplementation.7 8 Animal intervention\nstudies and studies of adults after severe inadvertent exposure\nindicate that dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls increase the\nrisk of cancer.9 10 Methylmercury may increase the risk of\nmyocardial infarction and cause neurological damage.11 12\nSince a meta-analysis of the effect of omega 3 fats on cardio-\nvascular morbidity and mortality in coronary heart disease sug-\ngested important benefits,13 a large intervention study has been\npublished.14 Our meta-analysis included these new data,\nbalanced protective effects with possible harm, assessed the\neffects of plant based omega 3 fats on health, included people\nwithout established cardiovascular disease, and highlighted\nimportant questions about the role of omega 3 fats on cardiovas-\ncular disease and mortality. We systematically reviewed the\neffects of long chain and short chain omega 3 fats (together and\nseparately) on mortality, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and\nbleeding events and analysed all relevant randomised controlled\ntrials (RCTs) and prospective cohort studies.\nMethods\nThe study methods have been described in detail elsewhere.15\nSearch strategy and study selection\nWe searched the Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, the\nNational Research Register, and SIGLE (to February 2002); we\nchecked the bibliographies of included studies and contacted the\nauthors. Articles not in English were translated. We excluded tri-\nals if they were not randomised; they had no omega 3 arm; the\nparticipants were children or were critically ill; the duration was\n< 6 months; the intervention was multifactorial; or data on\ndeath, cardiovascular disease, or cancer were not available. We\nrejected cohort studies if they did not assess the intake of omega\n3, follow-up was < 6 months, or the association between the\nintake of omega 3 and health was not investigated. Two reviewers\nassessed the inclusion of articles independently, and we\ncontacted authors for more information on methodological\nquality, outcomes, and further studies.\nA complete set of references is available on bmj.com\nCite this article as: BMJ, doi:10.1136\/bmj.38755.366331.2F (published 24 March 2006)\nBMJ Online First bmj.com page 1 of 9\nData extraction and quality assessment\nTwo reviewers independently extracted the data and assessed the\nquality of the studies. For RCTs we assessed the following quality\ncharacteristics: concealment of allocation to the study arms and\nthe masking of participants, providers, and outcome assessors. We\nclassed trials as having low risk of bias if allocation to the study\narms was concealed and participants, providers, and outcome\nassessors were masked. Quality assessment of cohort studies was\nbased on control group type, number lost to follow-up, baseline\nsimilarity, adjustment for dissimilarities, and masking.\nData synthesis\nFor RCTs we extracted the numbers of participants experiencing\neach outcome and total numbers randomised for each study\narm, and combined by using relative risks in random effects\nmeta-analysis.16 For cohort studies we used relative risk or odds\nratio that had been adjusted for the most confounding factors,\nand we compared the most exposed quantile with the least\nexposed quantile. We used one analysis only for each cohort per\noutcome.\nWe used subgrouping of RCTs to explore the effects on mor-\ntality, cardiovascular events, and cancer of long chain versus\nshort chain omega 3 fats and dietary advice versus supplementa-\ntion. We used random effects meta-regression to analyse the\neffects of the dose of omega 3 and the duration of the trial. Sen-\nsitivity analyses assessed the robustness of RCT results to trial\nquality by restricting the analysis to studies with low risk of bias.\nWe used Cochran\u2019s test for heterogeneity to determine\nwhether studies in a meta-analysis evaluated the same\nunderlying sizes of effect. We used I2 to measure the degree of\ninconsistency among studies (the proportion of total observed\nvariability due to genuine variation rather than random error\nwithin studies).17\nResults\nWe screened 15 159 titles and collected 926 full text papers.\nForty eight randomised controlled trials and 41 analyses of 26\nTitles and abstracts retrieved from electronic,\nbibliographical, and expert searches (n=15 159)\nTitles and abstracts that were unlikely\nto be relevant, excluded (n=14 233)\nPapers that could not be traced (incorrect\nreferences or not held by British Library) (n=25)\nPotential RCTs pending (as presence or\nabsence of outcomes unknown) (n=14)\nTitles and abstracts that were potentially\nrelevant, ordered as full text papers (n=926)\nFull papers assessed for inclusion\nor exclusion in duplicate (n=437)\nStudies included in the review\n RCTs: 111 papers, 48 studies\n Cohort studies: 42 papers, 41 studies\nFull papers quickly excluded on visual\n inspection (not duplicated)\n  Potential cohort studies (n=93)\n  Potential RCTs (n=371)\nPotential RCTs excluded:\n Not randomised (n=21)\n No control group (n=15)\n No omega 3 arm (n=13)\n Multifactorial intervention (n=22)\n Not adult, human, well (n=25)\n Not 6 months of follow-up (n=24)\n Total (n=120)\nPotential cohorts excluded:\n Not a cohort (n=10)\n No omega 3 assessment (n=108)\n No clinical outcomes (n=21)\n Not 6 months follow up (n=6)\n Omega 3 not assessed against clinical events\n  (n=4)\n Or in different individuals (n=1)\n Total (n=150)\nFig 1 The selection process for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies on omega 3 fatty acid and health outcomes\nTable 1 Characteristics of trials and cohort studies on effects of omega 3\nfats on mortality, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancer\nCriteria\nRandomised\ncontrolled trials Cohorts\nStudies and participants\nNo of participants 36 913 563 218, plus two where the sizenot described\nNo of studies 48 47 published analyses from 26\nNo of large studies 8 (>500 participants) 10 (>20 000 participants)\nFollow-up 0.5 to >z6 years 4 to 25 years\nRisk of CVD\nHave CVD 21 2\nModerate risk 10 2\nLow risk 17 22\nSex\n\u226570% men 24 14\n31% to 69% men 17 4\n\u226430% men 5 7\nNot stated 2 1\nMain outcome*\nCVD or mortality 32 13\nCancer 0 10\nOther outcomes 16 10\n*Several cohorts appear to have more than one main outcome.\nResearch\npage 2 of 9 BMJ Online First bmj.com\ncohort studies fulfilled all inclusion criteria (fig 1; for a complete\nset of references see bmj.com). Table 1 shows the main\ncharacteristics of the included studies.\nIntervention or exposure\nDietary supplements were given in 44 trials (36 as capsules, six as\noil, one each as liquid emulsion and enriched margarine), advice\non eating oily fish in three, and advice on diet and food supple-\nments in one. Supplements were long chain omega 3 fats\n(usually whole or concentrated fish oil; one small trial used\nrefined eicosapentaenoic acid and one used refined docosahex-\naenoic acid), and five studies provided shorter chain omega 3\nfats.

In 15\ncohort studies the outcome assessors were blinded to exposure,\nin two they were not blinded, and in nine blinding was unclear.\nIn the seven cohort studies that described omega 3 intake at\nbaseline (five assessed long chain omega 3 fats only, one short\nchain omega 3 fats only, and one assessed both), the characteris-\ntics of participants with high and low intake of omega 3 fats dif-\nfered. People who consumed most long chain omega 3 at\nbaseline had an advantage with regard to lifestyle (smoking, diet,\nand exercise), interest in health, and social factors (education, liv-\ning in town). Adjustment for these potential confounding factors\nmay not have been adequate (table 3).\nTotal mortality\nDeaths occurred in 15 RCTs (1995 deaths), and authors of 29\nRCTs reported that no deaths occurred. Evidence that risk of\ndeath was reduced in participants randomised to omega 3 (rela-\ntive risk 0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.73 to 1.03) was weak, and\ninconsistency was moderate (I2 = 42%) (fig 2). When analysis was\nrestricted to studies at low risk of bias this effect was attenuated\n(0.98, 0.70 to 1.36; 138 deaths), and inconsistency between RCTs\nwas low (I2 = 0%). This sensitivity analysis removed the RCT by\nSingh, whose studies have been questioned.18\nResults were similar for long chain versus short chain omega\n3 (fig 2) and dietary advice versus supplements (data not shown).\nMeta-regression indicated that the risk of death increased as the\nlength of the RCT increased (regression coefficient 0.008, 0.003\nto 0.012). This is compatible with omega 3 fats having an early\nprotective effect that later becomes harmful; however, the\nassociation was lost when we removed the large trial by Burr et\nal.14 Meta-regression did not suggest a relation between mortality\nand the dose of long chain omega 3. Cohort studies suggested\nthat omega 3 protected against death (0.65, 0.48 to 0.88;\nI2 = 36%), but it was unclear whether adjustment for confounders\nwas adequate.\nCombined cardiovascular events\nEighteen RCTs provided data on cardiovascular events in 2628\nparticipants. The meta-analysis showed no definite effect of\nomega 3 fats on cardiovascular events, but confidence intervals\nwere wide (0.95, 0.82 to 1.12) and inconsistency was high\n(I2 = 65%) (fig 3). Removing studies at moderate or high risk of\nbias reduced but did not remove inconsistency (1.09, 0.87 to\n1.37; 570 events; I2 = 49%).\nSubgrouping by long chain versus short chain omega 3 or by\nadvice to eat oily fish versus supplements did not generate robust\neffects of omega 3 fats on cardiovascular events. Cohort studies\nprovided no strong evidence that omega 3 fats protect against\ncardiovascular events.\nCancer\nTen RCTs reported the incidence of cancer; 391 diagnoses of\ncancer or death from cancer occurred in 17 433 participants\n(two of the trials reported no cancers). We found no evidence\nthat omega 3 fats had an effect on the incidence of cancer (1.07,\n0.88 to 1.30) and there was no inconsistency (I2 = 0%) (fig 4). Five\ntrials and seven events remained on sensitivity analysis.\nSeven cohort studies provided data on cancer (832 events in\nthe highest and lowest quantiles), and meta-analysis found no\neffect of high versus low intake of omega 3 (1.02, 0.87 to 1.19;\nI2 = 21%).\nOutcomes related to bleeding\nNine RCTs reported at least one stroke (243 strokes in total), but\nlittle information was available specifically on haemorrhagic\nstroke. Omega 3 had no clear effect on the total numbers of\nstrokes (1.17, 0.91 to 1.51; I2 = 0%), in sensitivity analysis (29\nevents), or in four cohort studies (0.87, 0.72 to 1.04) (fig 5).\nDiscussion\nOur meta-analysis of RCTs assessing the effects of increased\nomega 3 fats on total mortality found substantial variations\nbetween studies. Studies with stronger methodology had more\nconsistent results, and the pooled relative risk of these studies\nwas 0.98 (0.70 to 1.36; 138 events). We found no evidence from\nRCTs or cohort studies that omega 3 fats have an effect on com-\nbined cardiovascular events. Neither RCTs nor cohort studies\nshowed significantly increased risks of cancer or stroke with\nhigher intake of omega 3, but there were too few events to rule\nout important effects.\nTable 3 Adjustment carried out in 10 cohorts that assessed effects of\nomega 3 fats on cancer\nFactors* No of cohorts adjusted\u2020\nLifestyle factors\nSmoking 2\nAlcohol intake 2\nPhysical activity 1\nDietary fibre intake 1\nSaturated fat intake 1\nTrans fat intake 0\nRed meat intake 2\nFruit intake 0\nVegetable intake 0\nOthers\u2021:\nBody mass index 4\nTotal energy intake 5\nOther dietary factors, height, parity, and menopausal\nstatus\n1 each\nSocial factors\nPlace of residence 2\nEducation 2\nOther\u2021:\nEthnic origin 1\nSocioeconomic status 1\nInterest in health\nVitamin E supplementation 0\nMultivitamin supplementation 0\nOthers\u2021:\nUse of hormone replacement therapy 1\nFamily history of the disease studied 2\nPrecancerous symptoms 1\n*Factors that differ consistently between people taking most and least fish based omega 3\nfats; the association was consistent across all cohorts that assessed it and was seen in at\nleast two cohorts.\n\u2020The number of cohorts that adjusted for the factor in the most adjusted analysis, of the 10\ncohorts used in the cancer outcomes analysis.

We hoped that pooling studies at low\nrisk of bias might provide enough power to inform us of effects\non health, but this was not the case (only 138 deaths and 570\ncardiovascular events). Similarly, analysis of the effects of omega\n3 on rarer outcomes such as stroke had insufficient power to\ndetect clinically important effects. Unlike previous meta-\nanalyses, we reviewed systematically the effects of omega 3 fats\non mortality, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and bleeding events\nand analysed all relevant RCTs and prospective cohort studies.\nWe also accounted for differences in study quality and examined\nthe effects of long chain and short chain omega 3 fats in a wide\ngroup of participants; this provides high quality evidence to\nguide policy and practice.\nOther studies\nOur findings differ from those of a recent systematic review by\nBucher et al,13 which reviewed trials assessing the effects of long\nchain omega 3 fats over at least six months in patients with coro-\nnary heart disease and found significant protection frommortal-\nity (0.8, 0.7 to 0.9) and sudden death (0.7, 0.6 to 0.9).

When we pooled studies in\nwhich participants were given only long chain omega 3 fats or\nwere at high risk of cardiovascular disease the risk of death was\nnot significantly reduced. However, when we removed the study\nby Burr et al from our meta-analysis, risk of death was similar to\nthat reported by Bucher et al (0.83, 0.75 to 0.91). The study by\nBurr et al (included in our review as an unpublished study, since\npublished) is the second largest study in terms of deaths reported\n(525 deaths; the GISSI-P study reports 1031 deaths).21\nWhy does the study by Burr et al contradict the other large\nstudies by not suggesting a benefit of omega 3?14 The first possi-\nble explanation is that this RCT had the longest follow-up of all\nRCTs and the harmful effects of methylmercury could be cumu-\nlative. Time course analysis of the GISSI-P trial was consistent\nwith the risk of death rising over the 42 months of the trial, but\nthe increase in mortality was seen within the first year in the\nstudy by Burr et al.14 22 A second explanation is that the study by\nBurr et al was the only RCT that specifically enrolled men\ntreated for angina. Post hoc subgroup analysis of the GISSI-P\ntrial indicates that people with heart failure benefited most from\nomega 3 supplements (R Marchioli, personal communication,\n2004). As heart failure is more common after myocardial infarc-\ntion this may explain an attenuation of effect but would not\nexplain the increase in risk suggested in the study by Burr et al. A\nthird possibility is that omega 3 from oily fish has a different\neffect to fish oil supplements, but this was investigated by Burr et\nal and found not to explain the differences. It is therefore not\nclear why the results of Burr et al differ from the other large\nstudies on fish based omega 3. It is possible that performance\nbias due to differential care in the intervention and control arms\noccurred in trials where the intervention was not masked, includ-\ning GISSI-P and the Burr study,14 21 23 but dietary intake, other\nrelevant risk factors, and pharmacotherapy appeared similar in\nboth arms of these trials. It may be that the effect of omega 3 fats\non cardiovascular disease is smaller than previously thought, or\nthat its beneficial effect is limited to a specific group (such as\npatients after myocardial infarction or with heart failure) not\nrepresented in the study by Burr et al.14\nCohort studies or RCTs?\nA recent meta-analysis assessed the effects of consumption of\nfish on stroke in cohort studies and found that people who ate\nwhite or oily fish at least once a week had a significantly reduced\nrisk of stroke.24 We excluded cohort studies that assessed only\ntotal fish intake (as this is not clearly related to omega 3 intake).\nThe web of lifestyle, interest in health, and social factors (health\npatterning) seen in the cohort studies included in our review\nprovides an advantage to people taking most long chain omega\n3 fats, and this makes adequate adjustment for confounding dif-\nficult, if not impossible. Thus, we must rely on high quality RCTs\nto provide non-confounded answers about the effects of omega\n3 fats on health. Some effects of fish on health may be due to\ncomponents other than omega 3\u2014for example, selenium or vita-\nmin D.\nInterpretation\nIt is not clear whether long chain or short chain omega 3 fats\n(together or separately) reduce or increase total mortality,\ncardiovascular events, cancer, or strokes.Our findings do not rule\nout an important effect of omega 3 fats on total mortality, as\nrobust trials at low risk of bias reported few deaths. There is no\nevidence that the source (dietary or supplemental) and dose of\nomega 3 fats affected the effectiveness of long chain omega 3\nfats.\nUK guidelines encourage the general public to eat more oily\nfish, and higher amounts are advised after myocardial infarction\n(supported by trials after myocardial infarction).20 25 26 This advice\nshould continue at present but the evidence should be reviewed\nregularly. It is probably not appropriate to recommend a high\nintake of omega 3 fats for people who have angina but have not\nhad a myocardial infarction.\nAdjustment for lifestyle factors appeared to be inadequate in\nthe cohort studies, so policy and lifestyle decisions should be\nbased on data from RCTs. To understand the effects of omega 3\nfats on health, we need more high quality RCTs (with adequate\nconcealment of allocation and masking of participants and\nhealth providers) of long duration that also report the associated\nharms.\nThanks to Theresa Moore and Margaret Burke from the Cochrane Heart\nGroup, and to all of the authors of primary studies who helped us build up\nthe data.
