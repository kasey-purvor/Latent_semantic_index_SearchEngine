INTRODUCTION \nAdvances in modern wayfinding support technology have allowed \nusers in outdoor environments to access several services such as \nGoogle Maps, Nokia Maps, in-car satellite navigation systems and \nroadside digital signage.  Users are able to gain familiarity of a \nlocation prior to arrival (e.g. by observing a Google Map at home) \nas well as receive guidance along a route (e.g. by enabling GPS on \na mobile phone or using satellite navigation whilst driving).  \nWhile this form of support is available in outdoor locations, it is \nnot the case for indoor environments where users are generally \nrestricted to using traditional in-building wayfinding information.  \nWayfinding in indoor environments is also affected by graphic \nand architectural communication as well as aspects such as the \nspatial organization of the setting and the circulation system (i.e. \nhow to get to a certain point in the building) [16].  It is apparent \nhowever, that advances in pervasive digital display technology are \nenabling new possibilities for supporting indoor wayfinding and \nmaking this a timely topic of study. \nIn this paper, we describe our investigations into how digital \ndisplay systems and personal mobile devices might offer useful \nand usable wayfinding assistance to visitors of the Infolab21 \nbuilding in Lancaster University.  To achieve this we have carried \nout five formative studies (4 user studies and 1 questionnaire \nstudy) with 39 participants in total.  The details of each of these \nstudies and the insights received from them are discussed in detail \nin section 4.  Our studies have involved the following \ncomponents:  \n1. An experimental set-up consisting of the Hermes2 \ndigital display deployment (see figure 1) and the \nHermes2 Person Locator Kiosk within Infolab21. \n2. Personal mobile phones. \n3. Wayfinding content such as digital 2D maps and 3D fly-\nthroughs. \n \nFigure 1 \u2013 (a) typical Hermes2 digital display (b) deployment \nenvironment in Infolab21 \nWe investigated user attitudes toward the use of 2D and 3D \nwayfinding content, whether users found it useful to download \nthis information to a mobile phone to view along their route \n(similar to a car satellite navigation system) as well as receive \nadditional wayfinding assistance from Hermes2 digital displays.  \nFurthermore we explored how such a digital display deployment \nmight offer users useful and usable wayfinding support.  We also \ncarried on from our investigations in [9] by exploring whether \nHermes2 display owners were willing to share their door displays \n \nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for \npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are \nnot made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies \nbear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

In [9] we found that display \nowners wanted to be given the means to stipulate when necessary \nthat an important message set by themselves on their door display \nwould not be occluded by wayfinding content such as a graphical \ndirectional arrow. \nParticipants in each user study were asked to interact with the \nHermes2 Person Locator graphical user interface presented on a \ntouch screen display as a Kiosk (developed to a level of fidelity \nwhich allowed us to gain necessary insights and feedback) at the \nstart of their wayfinding task.  A wayfinding task involved the \nuser locating a lecturer\u2019s office in the Computing Department \nfrom the foyer area outside the department.  The Person Locator \nallowed users to select from a list of staff members, view a digital \n2D map and\/or a 3D fly-through and request graphical directional \narrows to show along their route.  As we did not use a location \nmodel, our approach was based around a Wizard of Oz setting \nwhere the wayfinding content shown to users was pre-determined \nrather than dynamically generated.   \nThe five formative studies have presented us with insights for \ndeveloping wayfinding assistance for visitors in an indoor \nenvironment (e.g. the Infolab21 building).  We also addressed the \nfollowing research questions concerning wayfinding in an in-\nbuilding environment: \n1. In what ways can users be supported along their route? \nE.g. in areas without situated displays, in cases where \nusers become disoriented or if users generally wish to \nview wayfinding content. \n2. How can users benefit from the use of 2D and 3D \nwayfinding content at the start of their wayfinding task? \nE.g. viewing a digital 2D map and\/or a 3D walkthrough \nbefore locating a lecturer\u2019s office.  \n3. How can we support concurrent use of the Hermes2 \ndisplays amongst users? How can users be associated \nwith relevant navigational signage on the displays? \n4. To what extent are Hermes2 display owners prepared to \nshare personal information (e.g. a message set on their \ndoor display \u201cAt the Infolab caf\u00e9, back in 30 min\u2026\u201d) \nand share their door displays to show wayfinding-\nrelated content to support users? \nThe sections in this paper are structured as follows.  Section 2 \ndescribes related work.  Section 3 will describe the experimental \nset-up used in the formative studies.  In section 4 we describe the \nmethods and results from the five formative studies.  Section 5 \nwill discuss the findings and Section 6 will conclude the paper \nand describe future work. \n2. RELATED WORK \n2.1 Situated Display Applications that \nSupport Wayfinding \nIn this section we observe the following studies which relate to \nour objective in gaining insights for developing wayfinding \nassistance within Infolab21.  Kray et al. [11] focused on \nproducing a location model by using the GAUDI system, which is \na prototype pervasive wayfinding system consisting of a set of \nwireless autonomous displays connected to a navigation server.  \nThe aim of GAUDI was to support public navigation by using \nwall-mounted adaptive displays which show directional signs (e.g. \nin the Lancaster University campus).  Displays are represented as \nnodes connected by edges in the location model, annotated with \nlocation-specific information and the calculation of routes are \nbased on the A* algorithm.  Similarly, in [10] we see a focus on \ninvestigating requirements and constraints toward developing a \nlocation model to support navigation in an indoor environment \nwith an infrastructure of digital displays.  For instance, this would \nbe applied in the context of the Hermes2 display deployment \n(which would provide dynamic signage) within Infolab21 \ncombined with the use of mobile devices to improve navigation.  \nIn [9], we addressed the issue of display control between Hermes2 \ndisplay owners and investigated whether display owners would be \nwilling to share their displays to show wayfinding content such as \na graphical arrow.  A questionnaire-based user study revealed that \ndisplay owners were positive toward sharing their display to show \nwayfinding-related content given that they maintained appropriate \ncontrol, i.e. they wanted to be given the means to stipulate when \nnecessary that an important message set by themselves would not \nbe occluded by wayfinding content such as a graphical arrow.  \nMuller et al. [15] investigated (by carrying out two separate field \nstudies in an outdoor location) pedestrian navigation support \nthrough use of (deployed) situated public displays and mobile \ndevices as well as factors concerning user acceptance and \nusability in this particular context.  During the studies, users were \nable to interact with situated displays designed for advertisements \nto receive wayfinding support along with using a mobile device in \na shopping scenario.  A key finding that Muller et al. have \npresented is that users tend to use a mobile device for wayfinding \nsupport while they are walking, however if they become \ndisoriented they are more willing to use a public display to view \nfor example, a map.   \nLiu et al. [13] focused on developing wayfinding support for \nindividuals with cognitive impairments.  This involved the use of \na prototype interface suitable for use on a handheld device which \npresented wayfinding information with different modalities, i.e. \ninvolving combinations of text messages, audio and images.  The \nuser studies revealed that participants were able to successfully \nuse the different types of modalities; however, different \nparticipants had different preferences in their preferred modalities. \nLijding et al. [12] describe a system named \u201cSmart Signs\u201d which \ninvolves using in-building situated displays to provide route \ndirections to users.  The system aims to accommodate several \ndifferent factors when communicating route information, \nincluding a user\u2019s mobility limitations, weather and emergency \nsituations such as fire or medical needs.   \n2.2 Mobile Phone based Wayfinding Support \nIn addition to situated display wayfinding support, we are also \ninterested in combining the use of mobile phones.  It is already \napparent that services such as Google Maps and Nokia Maps \nalong with GPS-enabled mobile phones have made it trivial for \nusers to receive wayfinding support along their route.  Users can \nalso view wayfinding content as both 2D and 3D representations.  \nChittaro and Nadalutti [1] looked at how an interactive 3D \nlocation-aware model of a building can be used to provide users \nwith evacuation instructions through a mobile device.  Two \ninformal user evaluations revealed that 3D location-aware models \nare promising in presenting navigation instructions in an indoor \nenvironment.  Frohlich et al. [6] focused on Points of Interest in a \nlocation and found that users appreciated the ability to access geo-\nspatial information by using a mobile device.  They also found \n3 \n \nthat different users had different preferences, that is, some \npreferred a traditional map view whereas others who have poor \nmap reading skills preferred augmented reality.  \nIn [8] we addressed the issue of mapping the physical and virtual \nplanes (mapping between physical world and a mobile guide) \nduring interaction with a context-aware mobile guide.  The paper \nevaluated two mobile guides, GUIDE [4] and Trammate.  By \ncarrying out three field trials with 60 participants, we proposed \nseveral interaction paradigms [8] as possible and useful \nabstractions for use in designing context-aware mobile guides, for \ninstance the Chaperone paradigm can behave as an expert system \nthat may take initiative away from the user during interaction (e.g. \nsystem corrects the user when she makes a wrong turn on a route) \nLimitations can also arise when using a mobile device, especially \nregarding restrictions with the size of the display, lower \nresolution, differences in input type, hardware limitations, and so \nforth [2].  Using a mobile phone while navigating in a public \nlocation can also affect a user\u2019s concentration and she may \nbecome likely to be distracted by activities in the environment.  \nTamminen et al. [18] state that cognitive resources can be in \ncompetition while a user is using a mobile phone in a public \nlocation and attention can become fragmented. \n2.3 Implications of 2D and 3D Spatial \nRepresentations in Wayfinding Support \nDifferent spatial representations convey different types of spatial \nknowledge, that is, landmark-recognition, route-finding \nknowledge and survey knowledge [7].  Essentially, by \nexperiencing a location from an egocentric point of view (e.g. a \n3D representation) users are able to gain landmark-recognition \nand route-finding knowledge.  By observing a location from an \nexocentric (bird\u2019s-eye) perspective, users can gain survey \nknowledge, which allows users to apply different configurational \nrelationships of a location into a single model [19].  However, \nusers can also gain survey knowledge from extensive immersion \nin a 3D environment with an egocentric view [19].  By \nconsidering the different types of information both 2D and 3D \nspatial representations convey it is clear that combining both types \nof information would be beneficial when providing users with \nwayfinding content. \n3. THE EXPERIMENTAL SET-UP \nTo investigate whether users find it useful to view wayfinding \ncontent such as a digital 2D map and\/or a 3D fly-through as well \nreceive wayfinding assistance along their route with the use of \nmobile phones and digital situated displays, we used an \nexperimental set-up consisting of the Hermes2 digital display \ndeployment and the Hermes2 Person Locator.  The following \nsubsections will describe the two components of the experimental \nset-up and the wayfinding content used in more detail. \n3.1 The Hermes2 System \n3.1.1 Background of the Hermes2 System \nThe Hermes2 system was designed to enable awareness in the \nworkplace, for instance, by adapting the idea of sticking a note on \na door saying \u201cOut for coffee\u201d, or \u201cBack in 5 minutes\u201d.  The first \nversion of the digital display system, known as Hermes [5], was \nfirst deployed in 2002 initially as PDAs, fixed adjacent to office \ndoors of lecturers, research assistants, PhD students and \nadministrative staff all of whom were members of the Computing \nDepartment at Lancaster University.  In 2006 the Computing \nDepartment moved to a newly constructed building and a new set \nof working prototypes were deployed.  The new deployment, \nknown as Hermes2, included several hardware improvements over \nthe old system (e.g. larger displays) and consists of forty displays \nin two corridors. \n3.1.2 Functionality of Hermes2 System \nDisplay owners are able to set a temporary text or multimedia \nmessage to show on their display (e.g. a photograph of a \nconference location) by using their personal web portal, by SMS \nusing a mobile phone or by e-mail (see figure 2 for system \narchitecture).  They are also able to view messages left by visitors \nusing their personal web portal.  Visitors can leave text messages \nusing an on-screen keyboard, a scribbled message (using a \nscribble component), a video message and an audio message, for \nexample a visitor might find that Dr. Smith has gone for lunch by \nreading his temporary message and she decides to leave a text \nmessage using an on-screen keyboard such as \u201cHi, it\u2019s Sarah, \ncame to see you at 12.30\u2026\u201d \nFigure 2 below shows the architecture of the experimental set-up \nconsisting of the Hermes2 system as well as the Hermes2 Person \nLocator (discussed in section 3.2). \n \nFigure 2 \u2013 System architecture of the experimental set-up \n3.1.3 Description of the Hermes2 Application \nThere are currently two different versions of the Hermes2 \napplication but both versions are based around a Model View \nController model where the Model involves a MySQL database \n(which holds for example, display owner details), the View \ninvolves the graphical user interface and the Controller provides \nfunctionality for the messaging (e.g. a scribble component which \nallows users to send scribbled messages). \nThe first version has been designed and developed to be highly \ncustomizable (to support student research projects, etc.) and \nconsists of a middleware which provides services such as access \nto configuration information, and software components that \nprovide functionality [5].  This was designed to allow users to \nsecurely add or modify components of the system.  The \narchitecture consists of a Java-based implementation on the client \nside (the graphical user interface).  The server is responsible for \nrunning the Hermes2 clients and messages set by display owners \nas well as visitors [3].  The server also hosts a MySQL database, \nwhich stores information based on component configuration, \n4 \n \nowner preferences and system logs (e.g. actions carried out by \nusers on the graphical user interface).   \nThe second version (and the one used the study described in \nsection 4.5), is a web-based AJAX application developed in \nASP.NET and combines C# server-side functionality.  The client-\nside incorporates Javascript, XML, HTML and Web Services as a \ncommunication layer.  This version of the Hermes2 application \nhas similar functionality; however visitors are not able to leave \nvideo or audio-based messages. Six out of forty displays are \ncurrently running this application.   \n3.2 The Hermes2 Person Locator \n3.2.1 The Hermes2 Person Locator User Interface \nThe Hermes2 Person Locator is part of a prototype system \ndesigned to explore (in our user studies described in section 4) \nwhether users would find it useful to view wayfinding related \ncontent at the start of their wayfinding task.  It was also designed \nto enable users to receive wayfinding support along their route \n(similar to the idea of an in-car satellite navigation system) by \nallowing them to download wayfinding content to a mobile phone \nas well as receive assistance from Hermes2 digital displays.  The \nPerson Locator graphical user interface was presented on a touch \nscreen display set up as a Kiosk, which was connected to a laptop \nthat ran the Person Locator application.  Two versions of the \ngraphical user interface were developed.   \nThe first version of the Person Locator (see figure 3a), written in \nJava, allowed users to select from a list of staff members, press a \nbutton to view a digital 2D map and\/or another button to view a \n3D fly-through.  Both the map and the fly-throughs were pre-\ndetermined (see sections 3.2.2.3 and 3.2.2.4 for details) as we did \nnot use a location model.  Users were also able to download this \ninformation to a mobile phone.  The graphical user interface \nunderwent several modifications based on user feedback (see \nsection 4 for Conducted Studies) as well as design choices to \nexplore aspects such as whether users would find it useful to view \na lecturer\u2019s Hermes2 temporary message at the start of their \nwayfinding task.     \n \nFigure 3 - (a) First version of the Hermes2 Person Locator (b) \nsecond version of the Hermes2 Person Locator \nThe second, web-based, version of the Hermes2 Person Locator \n(figure 3b) was written in ASP.NET.  The graphical user interface \ndisplayed a list of staff members represented by photographs \nalong with their Hermes2 temporary message below.  Users were \nable to select a member of staff and request a graphical directional \narrow to be shown on Hermes2 displays along their route.  We \ndeveloped a second web-based version of the Person Locator as it \nallowed more flexibility in terms of communication with the web-\nbased version of the Hermes2 application running on the digital \ndisplays (as described in section 3.1.3).  Being web-based, users \ncan also access this version of the Person Locator graphical user \ninterface via a Hermes2 display. \n3.2.2 Functionality of the Hermes2 Person Locator \n3.2.2.1 Supporting User Navigation with Mobile \nDevices \nTo explore whether users would find it useful to download the \ndigital 2D map and\/or the 3D fly-through to view along their route \nto a lecturer\u2019s office, we included a Bluetooth-based download \nfeature in the first version of the Person Locator.  After viewing \nthe map or the 3D fly-through users were able to download this \ninformation to a mobile phone, which we supplied to avoid \ntechnical issues (see figure 9b).  We used an external Java library \nknown as Bluecove and the files were transferred by using OBEX \nobject push.  The map files were transferred in JPG format and the \nfly-throughs as 3GP (see sections 3.2.2.3 and 3.2.2.4 for details).     \nAn alternative to allowing users to download wayfinding content \nusing a mobile phone would involve a printer next to the Hermes2 \nPerson Locator Kiosk.  After a user views a digital 2D map on the \ngraphical user interface, she may wish to print out a copy of this \nmap using the printer.  However, this solution can produce \nadditional costs such as for the printer, toner cartridges, paper, etc.  \nUsers may also discard the map after having used it. \n3.2.2.2 Supporting User Navigation with Dynamic \nSignage on the Hermes2 Displays \nIn order to explore whether users would find it useful to view \ngraphical directional arrows on the Hermes2 situated displays \nalong their route, the first version of the Hermes2 Person Locator \nincluded a low-fidelity implementation of this feature.  Users were \nable to request the arrows to be shown along their route by using \nthe Person Locator graphical user interface; however the arrows \nwere manually triggered to show on the displays. \n \nFigure 4 \u2013 Graphical directional arrow on a Hermes2 display \nIn the second version of the Person Locator, we explored the \nutility of personalizing (e.g. sketching a personal symbol) a \ngraphical directional arrow by using touch (see figure 5) prior to \nrequesting the arrows to be shown on the Hermes2 displays.  We \nwere interested in whether this would help associate users with the \nrelevant arrow (especially in cases where multiple users are \nconcurrently using the displays to navigate) as well as introduce a \nsense of entertainment.  The personalized arrow would then be \nsaved as an image in a file directory on the Hermes2 server.  \nBased on the user\u2019s selected location (i.e. a selected lecturer\u2019s \noffice), the arrow is then shown on specific displays.  A user\u2019s \nselected location is compared in a lookup table stored on a \ndatabase on the Hermes2 server (see figure 2 for system \narchitecture).  If a user selects, for example, office number C44, \nan arrow with right orientation will be shown on offices C41, \nC42, and so forth.  The arrows were also shown on the Hermes2 \ndisplays with a degree of transparency in order to meet display \nowner feedback received from [9] (see section 2.1).   \nb a \n5 \n \n \nFigure 5 \u2013 Example of a personalized graphical directional \narrow on the Person Locator graphical user interface \nWe see a similar approach in associating users on a digital display \nby using a personal symbol in [17] where Streitz et al. explored \nthe use of a Hello.Wall ambient display which uses light patterns \nto emit awareness information to users in order to enhance \ncollaboration between distributed teams in the workplace. \n3.2.2.3 Digital 2D Map Development \nThe digital 2D map was designed to provide users with an \nexocentric perspective of their route.  As we were investigating \nwhether users would find it useful to be able to choose an \nexocentric and\/or an egocentric (e.g. a 3D fly-through) \nperspective, we included a specific section of the Infolab21 \nbuilding on the map so that users would be able to find their way \nfrom their current location (the foyer area) to a lecturer\u2019s office in \nthe Computing Department.  Thus, the digital 2D map was not \ndesigned to be scalable to support wayfinding on multiple floors.  \nUsing a digital map also allowed us to appropriately annotate each \nroute, e.g. by showing a dotted line to different destination offices \nbased on the user\u2019s selection (see figure 6b).   \nEach 2D map was generated as a JPG picture file and stored in a \nfile directory.  Essentially, different digital map files were shown \nfor different selected destinations.  For the user studies, we only \ngenerated maps for the destination offices which users were \ninstructed to locate.  The presentation of the digital 2D map was \nstatic, however users were able to introduce interactivity by for \nexample, downloading a JPG map file to a mobile phone and \nzooming in and out.  \nFor determining a means of orienting the map (which way up it \nshould face), we asked 3 users (in July 2008) to sketch \u201cmental \nmaps\u201d of how they perceived the environment.  Such mental maps \nwould produce the notion of a \u201cpublic image\u201d shared by members \nof the Computing Department.  Our approach here was based on \nthe work of Lynch [14] who introduces the notion of imageability.   \nAlthough Lynch\u2019s descriptions are in an outdoor context, they can \nappropriately be applied to indoor environments.  The three \nresulting sketches showed similar orientation, which was then \nused as part of the user studies.  \n \nFigure 6 \u2013 (a) mental map sketched by user (b) digital 2D map \npresented on the graphical user interface \nThe map also included several navigational cues.  The user\u2019s route \nwas annotated by a dotted line, the destination location included a \nmarker to direct user attention and landmarks such as the \nphotocopy machine, printer and fire-exits were included and \nexplained through a key.  The user\u2019s current location was shown \nusing a visual instruction (see figure 6b), as the map was designed \nto only direct users to one area (i.e. Computing Department on C-\nfloor).  However, as part of future development, a more effective \nsolution would involve presenting step-by-step instructions, which \nusers can navigate through by pressing a \u201cNext\u201d button (see \nsection 6 for more detail). \n3.2.2.4 3D Fly-through Development \nThe 3D fly-throughs allowed users to view their route from their \ncurrent location (the foyer area) to a lecturer\u2019s office in the \nComputing Department with an egocentric perspective. The fly-\nthroughs were presented as continuous media, that is, video clips \nof approximately 20 seconds (depending on the length of the \nroute) in duration with options to pause and play.  \n \nFigure 7 \u2013 (a) GtkRadiant modelling environment (b) \nscreenshot of the 3D model running on Quake 3 \nThe 3D model used in the fly-throughs was developed by using \nGtkRadiant (see figure 7a) and by using the Quake 3 game engine.  \nIn more detail, we developed a 3D model of the Computing \nDepartment on C-floor, Infolab21 and a small section of B-floor \n(the foyer area on the floor below).  Quake 3 was then used to run \nthe compiled 3D model (see figure 7b).  We used GtkRadiant as a \nmodelling environment due to its open-source implementation, \nwhich allows flexibility in terms of modifications, bug-fixes and \nso forth.  The textures applied on each structure (e.g. walls, doors, \netc) were composed of photographs taken inside the Infolab21 \nbuilding, thus making the environment salient in terms of colour, \nform and appearance.  Enlarged signs were also added to the \nenvironment outside the office doors to facilitate wayfinding for \nusers, thus allowing each office to be clearly identified. \n \nFigure 8 - 3D fly-through on the graphical user interface \nThe 3D fly-throughs were generated by recording (using an in-\ngame recording program named Fraps) the Quake 3 character \nwalking from one location to another, for example, from the foyer \na b \na b \n6 \n \narea to Dr. Keith Cheverst\u2019s office.  The recorded files were then \nconverted into JMF-compatible MPG files to display on the \nPerson Locator graphical user interface (see figure 8).  Each of \nthese files also had an equivalent file in 3GP format for \ndownloading purposes.  We used 3GP as it is generally a standard \nfile format for mobile phones.  Similar to the digital 2D map files \nonly a certain number of files were generated, i.e. routes to the \noffices which users were instructed to locate. \n4. CONDUCTED STUDIES \nTo investigate how digital display systems and personal mobile \ndevices might offer useful and usable wayfinding assistance to \nvisitors of the Infolab21 building, we employed a methodology \nbased on the use of an experimental set-up and five user studies. \nDuring the studies we would observe what appeared useful and \nunuseful to carefully design each progressive user study.  Table 1 \nbelow presents an overview of five formative studies carried out \nwith 39 participants.  Details of each study are included in the \nsubsections that follow. \nTable 1.  Overview of the formative studies conducted  \n# Objective Users Technologies Used \n1 User study - exploring \nuse of mobile phones \nand viewing 2D\/3D \nwayfinding content \n8 (4m, \n4f) \nFirst version of the \nHermes2 Person Locator, \nmobile phone \n2 Follow-on study to first \nstudy \n6 (3m, \n3f) \nFirst version of the \nHermes2 Person Locator, \nmobile phone \n3 Questionnaire \u2013 \nExploring whether \nHermes2 display \nowners are willing to \nshare personal \ninformation and their \ndoor displays to support \nwayfinding \n12 (8f, \n4m) \nQuestionnaires were \nissued to 6 administrative \nstaff, 4 researchers and 2 \nlecturers in the \nComputing Department \n4 User study -Exploring \nthe combined use of \nmobile phone and \nsituated displays  \n10 \n(5m, \n5f) \nFirst version of the \nHermes2 Person Locator, \nmobile phone, Hermes2 \nsystem \n5 User study \u2013 exploring \nuser attitudes toward \nuse of dynamic signage \n3 (1f, \n2m) \nSecond version of the \nHermes2 Person Locator, \nHermes2 system \n4.1 General Approach \nOur formative studies (apart from the questionnaire based study) \ninvolved an experiment configuration where users were presented \nwith a touch screen display as a Kiosk that displayed the Hermes2 \nPerson Locator graphical user interface (which ran on a laptop \nconnected to the Kiosk).  To avoid technical issues, users were \nsupplied with a mobile phone to download wayfinding content.  \nThe Kiosk was set up in the foyer area (e.g. see figure 9a) next to \nthe entrance within the Infolab21 building, a predominantly office \nbased environment, where the system is originally intended to be \nused.  To maintain ecological validity, we recruited users who \nwere unfamiliar with the environment (apart from one user in our \nfifth study).  However, this caused difficulties with the \nrecruitment process, thus limiting the total number of users for \neach study.  A realistic setting was further maintained by limiting \nthe number of instructions given to users, i.e. users were presented \nonly with a scenario where they were asked to locate a specific \nlecturer in the Computing Department.  This approach can be \nadvantageous as well as disadvantageous.  For instance, it would \nallow us to identify user preferences in a relatively unbiased \nsetting; however, it may cause users to overlook certain aspects \nthat are being investigated. \nEvaluation methods used during the user studies included protocol \nanalysis, observation, semi-structured interviews and \nquestionnaires.  The first version of the Hermes2 Person Locator \nwas used in the first, second and fourth user study.  The second \nversion of the Person Locator was used in the fifth study and the \nHermes2 system was involved in the fourth and fifth user study. \n4.2 Studies 1 and 2 - Exploring Mobile Phone \nuse with 2D and 3D Wayfinding Content \nIn our first formative study we focused on exploring user attitudes \ntoward viewing a combination of 2D and 3D wayfinding content \n(i.e. a digital 2D map and a 3D fly-through of a user\u2019s route) and \nwhether users would find it useful to \u2018take away\u2019 (i.e. download) \nthis information using a mobile phone to view along their route.  \nThe study took place in August 2008 with eight participants (4 \nmale, 4 female) with an average age of 23.25 years.  Five of the \nusers had a low level of computer literacy, one had average \nliteracy and two users had high literacy.   \n \nFigure 9 \u2013 (a) User study set-up with the Kiosk (b) Mobile \nphone used in the user studies   \nThe study showed that users were very positive towards a system \nthat allowed users to choose both types of wayfinding content \nbased upon their preference.  These relate to expectations (before \nviewing the digital 2D map or the 3D fly-through), past \nexperiences, familiarity, curiosity and general individual \npreferences.   \n\u201cThe advantage of the map is that you can see everything but the \n[3D fly-through] helps you see what you need to see\u201d (PM) \n\u201cThe [3D fly-through] provokes more curiosity and interest.\u201d \n(DZ) \n\u201cThe [3D fly-through] is better than I initially expected\u201d (KS) \n\u201cI\u2019m generally useless with maps because I have problems \norientating and it\u2019s more useful if things are presented to me in \nperspective\u201d (GL) \nInsights toward the use of mobile phones to support wayfinding \nwere limited as we allowed users to choose whether or not to \ndownload wayfinding content to a mobile phone.  As the routes \nwhich users were given were relatively short, users did not feel \nthe need to download the 2D digital map or the 3D fly-through to \na mobile phone.  Thus we carried out a follow-on study where we \nencouraged users (with possibility of objection) to download \nwayfinding content to a mobile phone in order to find their way to \na lecturer\u2019s office.  The graphical user interface of the Hermes2 \na b \n7 \n \nPerson Locator was also modified as users overlooked the button \nwhich allowed them to view a 3D fly-through (next to the button \nfor the digital 2D map).  The placement of the two buttons was \nswitched, thus allowing the 3D fly-through to be more visible to \nusers. \nThe follow-on study was carried out in January 2009 with 6 users \n(3 male, 3 female) with an average age of 22.5 years.  Three of the \nusers had an average level of computer literacy while three had \nlow literacy.  \nResults indicated that by downloading wayfinding content to a \nmobile phone, users felt a sense of security and reassurance while \nwalking along their route.  By observing users it was apparent that \nthey referred back to the information on the mobile phone as they \nwere walking.  Two users matched office door numbers in the \nphysical environment to the information (e.g. the digital 2D map) \non their phone. \n\u201cI felt more secure by having the 3D fly-through on my phone\u201d \n(CF) \n\u201cThe phone allowed me to refer back to the map\u201d (JC) \n4.3 Study 3 - Exploring Implications of \nSharing Hermes2 Situated Displays to Support \nWayfinding \nTo explore whether Hermes2 display owners were prepared to \nprovide information (e.g. their temporary message set on their \ndoor display, their photograph, etc.) and allow their door display \nto share content (e.g. a graphical arrow) that would assist visitors \ntrying to find their way to a staff member\u2019s office, we issued \nquestionnaires in March 2009 to six administrative staff, four \nresearchers and two lecturers (8 female, 4 male) with an average \nage of 32.4 years.  The questionnaire included general questions \nas well as Likert scale based questions. \n \nFigure 10 \u2013 Average Likert scale ratings from questionnaire \nThe Likert scale ratings from the questionnaire (figure 10) shows \nthat display owners were generally comfortable with allowing \nvisitors to view directions to their office (i.e. as a 3D fly-through \nor on a map) as well as sharing their Hermes2 temporary message \nand their photograph on the Hermes2 Person Locator graphical \nuser interface.     \n\u201cPractical [to allow visitors to view my temporary message on the \ngraphical user interface] in case I go home, ideally I could use my \nmobile phone\/computer to set that message, for example if I \ndecide in the morning to work from home\u201d (BA) \nDisplay owners were also willing to share their displays to show a \ngraphical directional arrow to assist users in their wayfinding task.  \nSimilarly, in [9] display owners also responded with either \n\u201cAgree\u201d or \u201cStrongly Agree\u201d (mean = 4.67) on the Likert scale for \nthe question \u201cgenerally happy for my Hermes display to be used \nto support the navigation system\u201d [9]. \n4.4 Study 4 - Exploring Combined Use of \nMobile Phones and Hermes2 Situated Displays \nAnother user study was carried out in March 2009 to investigate \nwhether users found it useful to use a mobile phone and situated \ndisplays to assist them along their route.  The study involved ten \nusers (5 male, 5 female) with an average age of 24 years.  Four \nusers had an average level of computer literacy, three users with \nhigh literacy and three with low literacy.  An extra button was \nadded on the Person Locator graphical user interface which \nallowed users to request directional arrows to be shown on the \nHermes2 displays along their route (as introduced in section \n3.2.2.2). \nResults from the study showed that the user interface caused \nlimitations as seven out of ten users were unsure what to expect \nfrom the button which allowed them to request directional arrows \non the Hermes2 displays.  As only one user used and understood \nthis feature, no significant results can be drawn.  However, after \ndescribing the directional arrow feature to users during the semi-\nstructured interviews, users showed a significant amount of \ninterest toward using the Hermes2 displays along with mobile \nphones for wayfinding assistance.  For instance, four out of ten \nusers stated that they would use both a mobile phone showing \nwayfinding content as well as the Hermes2 displays with \ndirectional arrows.  Three out of ten users would only use the \ndisplays and the remaining three would only use a mobile phone. \nUsers also found it helpful to be able to view a staff member\u2019s \nHermes2 temporary message on the graphical user interface at the \nstart of their wayfinding task.   \n\u201cThe [Hermes2 temporary message] saves wasted trips and \nespecially useful if they aren\u2019t in all day, so you don\u2019t hang \naround waiting for them\u201d (SB) \n4.5 Study 5 - Exploring Use of Dynamic \nSignage on Hermes2 Situated Displays \nWe further investigated the use of Hermes2 digital displays in \nproviding wayfinding support in a formative study carried out in \nJuly 2009 involving three users (1 female, 2 male) with an \naverage age of 23.3 years.  Using the second version of the Person \nLocator graphical user interface users were able to select a \nlecturer (see figure 11) and personalize a graphical directional \narrow (by sketching a symbol), which they would be able to view \non Hermes2 digital displays along their route.   \n \nFigure 11 \u2013Study set-up in the foyer area outside the \nComputing Department \nWe also asked the users to touch each arrow on the displays along \ntheir route in order to disable them as they walked by and to also \n8 \n \nprovoke thought based on the types of interaction they might \nprefer.  As we did not involve many users for this study, we spent \na significant amount of time with each user (approximately 1 \nhour). \nThe feedback we received from users can be categorized based on \nthe placement of the situated displays, wayfinding related content \nshown on the displays and the types of interaction that users \nwould prefer.   \n4.5.1 Placement \nThe user study revealed all three users had different preferences \nregarding the placement of the Hermes2 digital displays to receive \nwayfinding assistance along their route (i.e. through graphical \ndirectional arrows).  For instance, one user (CS) would prefer to \nsee the displays along the floor. \n\u201cI think seeing them on the side is slightly awkward, probably for \ntwo reasons.  One, when you\u2019re walking straight, you don\u2019t tend \nto look, you know, laterally to either side\u2026 People tend to look \nforward or down slightly\u2026 What would probably be more kind of \nergonomic, although slightly difficult, would be to have them on \nthe floor somehow so you can simply glance down and see where \nyou\u2019re going and you won\u2019t run into people\u2026\u201d (CS) \nAnother user (EC) expected to see a situated display on the top \n(close to the ceiling) whereas VC was comfortable viewing the \ndisplays to the side.  It was apparent however, that all three users \nwere able to successfully follow the arrows on the displays to \ntheir destination regardless of their stated preferences.   \nWe asked users whether they would like to see the graphical \narrows on a particular side of the corridor (e.g. on the side of the \ncorridor where the user\u2019s destination office is located) and two \nusers (EC and VC) confirmed that they would normally assume \ntheir destination office would be located on the side of the \ncorridor which is showing the graphical arrow. \n\u201cNormally I would assume if the arrow is on the right or if it\u2019s on \nthe left the [destination] office would be on that side, because you \nwouldn\u2019t have an arrow on the right and suddenly you have an \narrow saying this way and it\u2019s opposite the actual office\u201d (EC) \nCS on the other hand, would like to see arrows shown on all \ndisplays (i.e. on both sides of the corridor) along his route. \nAs there are areas within Infolab21 without Hermes2 displays, \ntwo users (EC and CS) who were both unfamiliar with the \nenvironment had difficulty finding their way until they reached \nthe first Hermes2 display showing a graphical arrow.  All three \nusers agreed that it would have been useful to view wayfinding \ncontent at the beginning of their wayfinding task in order to \nestablish the position of their current location and their destination \nlocation.  Thus, the first version of the Person Locator was \ndemonstrated to users, and they confirmed that it would be useful \nto view wayfinding content such as a digital 2D map and\/or a 3D \nfly-through as well as download this content to a mobile phone.  \nUsers also stated that if this type of support was unavailable at the \nstart of their wayfinding task, the digital displays would need to \nbe placed throughout the entire route to provide assistance. \n4.5.2 Wayfinding Content \nAll three users stated that they would find it useful to receive \nassistance along their route by viewing wayfinding related content \non the Hermes2 displays (e.g. by touching the arrow on a display). \n\u201cIf [the display] tells me that I need to walk five minutes towards \nthis place, if I pass five minutes or if I\u2019m near five minutes I would \nknow\u2026\u201d(EC) \n\u201cIf it\u2019s a building I don\u2019t know, then how many more doors I have \nto pass by, maybe it\u2019s very good to know that.  You are left with \nthree more arrows and then two so that you know that you are \nreaching the office\u201d (VC) \nUsers CS and EC who stated that their field of view is normally \ndirected to what is in front of them, stated that flashing arrows on \nthe Hermes2 displays would be useful in directing attention. \n\u201cA flashing arrow would help attract my attention and I could see \nmaybe from a distance then where the next one is.  It might be \nmore useful\u2026\u201d (CS) \nUsers also stated that they would find it useful if they were able to \nview wayfinding content such as a digital 2D map or a fly-through \non the Hermes2 displays.  EC would prefer to view a 3D fly-\nthrough on the displays and both VC and CS would prefer to see a \ndigital 2D map. \n\u201c[a map on the display] that says you are here and your \ndestination is here would be very useful and then when you get to \nthe next [display], touch it, you are now here and your destination \nis here\u2026\u201d (CS) \nWe asked users whether concurrent users using the digital \ndisplays for wayfinding support would affect the sketch they \nmade on their directional arrow (i.e. the displays would show \nmore than one arrow).  All three users stated that they would want \nto sketch something that they would remember and in addition, \nCS and VC would prefer to choose a unique color to associate \nthemselves with. \n\u201cIf I could do both, that would be better for me.  I think that way it \nwould be easier to identify MY arrow\u201d (CS) \n4.5.3 Interaction \nAll three users confirmed that they would prefer the arrows to \nappear automatically as they approached the Hermes2 displays as \nwell as disappear after they have passed by.  This would be far \nmore effective and less time consuming than having to touch each \narrow in order to disable it as they walked by.  Hence, all users \nwould feel comfortable being tracked by the displays. \nVC and CS had privacy-related concerns regarding office \noccupants when interacting with the displays. \n\u201cSay the person is inside at work and you just come here and \ntouch your arrow on the display, they might think, what are you \ndoing?\u201d(VC) \n\u201c\u2026when looking to the side I\u2019m always looking into people\u2019s \noffices and if they\u2019re sat there typing it might be off putting for \nthem.\u201d(CS) \nFurthermore, users CS and EC would only interact with the \ndisplays if they are disoriented or unsure of their current position \nalong their route. \n\u201cOnly if I found difficulty I would use [the 3D fly-through] again \non the display\u201d (EC) \n5. DISCUSSION \nIn this section we discuss the key findings and insights gained by \ncarrying out the five formative studies, which are interrelated with \nthe research questions regarding wayfinding in an in-building \nenvironment, introduced in section 1. \n9 \n \nBy presenting both 2D and 3D wayfinding content users were able \nto choose the type of information to view based on their \npreference.  User PM in our first study wanted to gain an overall \nunderstanding of the location (by viewing the digital 2D map) as \nwell as view his route in perspective (by viewing the 3D fly-\nthrough).  However, user expectations and familiarity caused \nlimitations in some cases, for example we found that one user \n(KS) in our first formative study only viewed the digital 2D map \nas he was most familiar with maps.  KS had expected the 3D fly-\nthrough to be exceedingly complicated; however, after having \ndemonstrated this to him, KS felt the 3D fly-through would have \nbeen more useful. \nIt was evident that by downloading wayfinding content to a \nmobile phone, users felt secure as they were able to refer back to \nthis information throughout their route.  We also found that this \nfeature would be far more useful in larger and more complex \nenvironments.  Limitations were caused by the destination \nlocations (or lecturer\u2019s offices) we instructed users to locate, \nwhich involved relatively short routes.  For instance, in our first \nformative study, where we allowed users to choose whether or not \nto download wayfinding content, seven out of eight users did not \nfeel the need to do so.  Users also stated that the environment was \nrelatively simple to navigate in.  Thus in future studies it would be \nbeneficial to provide users with longer routes. \nThe feedback received from users in the fifth formative study \nbased on the placement of displays, wayfinding content that users \nwould like to see and interactions that users would prefer, has \ngiven insight into how a pervasive digital display deployment \nsuch as Hermes2 might provide useful and usable wayfinding \nsupport.  For instance it would be useful to provide users with \nwayfinding content on the Hermes2 displays along their route in \naddition to graphical directional arrows.  This includes digital 2D \nmaps, 3D fly-throughs as well as information based upon the \nuser\u2019s progress, which would especially be useful in larger in-\nbuilding environments where it may take more than five minutes \nto walk to an office.  For instance, this may involve the amount of \ntime users have left or the number of remaining arrows on the \ndisplays before the destination is reached.  Users also found it \nuseful to personalize their arrow on the Person Locator graphical \nuser interface, for example two users stated that they would prefer \nto sketch their personal symbol as well as choose a unique arrow \ncolour.  This creates an association between the user and the \nrelevant directional arrow, which can account for circumstances \nwhere multiple users are concurrently finding their way in the \nenvironment by receiving this form of wayfinding assistance from \nthe Hermes2 displays.  It must however, be considered that users \nmay feel they are being intrusive to the office occupant when \ninteracting with the displays for wayfinding purposes rather than \nmeeting with the occupant. \nWe found that due to the gaps in the layout of the Hermes2 \ndisplays (i.e. areas without displays) it is essential that users view \nwayfinding content such as a digital 2D map and\/or a 3D fly-\nthrough at the start of their wayfinding task.  This would allow \nthem to form an understanding of their current location and their \ndestination location and point them in the appropriate direction \nuntil they reach the first Hermes2 display showing a directional \narrow.  It was also apparent from our fourth and fifth user studies \nthat users would find it useful to use a mobile phone showing \nwayfinding content along their route to compensate for the gaps in \nthe Hermes2 display layout. \nThe studies revealed that users would find it useful to receive \nwayfinding assistance from the Hermes2 displays; however it was \nessential to investigate the attitudes of Hermes2 display owners in \nallowing their display to show wayfinding-related content.  The \nquestionnaire based (third) user study demonstrated positive \nattitudes from display owners (see figure 10).  Display owners \nwere willing to share personal information such as their temporary \nmessage and their photograph for users to view on the Hermes2 \nPerson Locator graphical user interface.  In addition, as supported \nby the questionnaire study carried out in [9], display owners were \nwilling to allow their displays to show wayfinding-related content.   \n6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK \nIn this paper we have investigated how digital display systems and \npersonal mobile devices might offer useful and usable wayfinding \nassistance to users in the Infolab21 building.  To achieve this we \nhave carried out five formative studies using an experimental set-\nup consisting of the Hermes2 digital display deployment and the \nHermes2 Person Locator Kiosk.  Furthermore we have involved \nthe use of mobile phone technology and wayfinding content such \nas a digital 2D map and a 3D fly-through. \nResults from the formative studies showed that users found it \nuseful to view a digital 2D map and\/or a 3D fly-through based on \ntheir preference, which was influenced by factors such as past \nexperiences, expectations, familiarity, curiosity and general \nindividual preferences.  However, it was apparent that in some \ncases familiarity can cause limitations as a user may choose to \nview a digital 2D map and later realize a 3D fly-through would \nhave been more useful.   \nAs the 2D map presented to users was designed for the purposes \nof the formative studies, as part of future work, this would need to \nbe scaled so that it provides wayfinding support on multiple \nfloors.  Users can be presented with instructions which they can \nnavigate through by using a \u201cNext\u201d button and this can be \naccompanied by images as well as text (e.g. a photograph of a \nstaircase followed by instructions to use the stairs).  Once the user \nreaches for example, the doors to the Computing Department, \nthey can then be shown a 2D map.  The 3D fly-through can also \nbe extended from its current form as continuous media to allowing \nusers to be able to navigate (e.g. by using keyboard input) in the \nQuake 3 environment (as described in section 3.2.2.4) on the \ngraphical user interface and follow a route represented by a green \nline to their destination location.  This would allow the user to \nobserve the surrounding environment as well allow more \nflexibility in terms of pace. \nThe user studies have also shown positive user attitudes towards \nreceiving wayfinding assistance using a mobile phone coupled \nwith situated digital displays.  Viewing wayfinding content such \nas a 3D fly-through on a mobile phone allowed users to feel \nreassured along their route.  Users also confirmed that using a \nmobile phone would be useful in areas without displays (e.g. if \nusers requested directional arrows to be shown on the displays).   \nWe have received a significant amount of feedback regarding how \nusers would want to receive useful and usable wayfinding \nassistance from Hermes2 situated displays.  It was apparent that \ndifferent users would prefer to view the displays in different \nlocations (e.g. along the floor) although no difficulties were \nexperienced in viewing the displays in their original location.  \nUsers would also benefit from viewing wayfinding content (e.g. a \ndigital 2D map) on the display along their route.  Furthermore, we \n10 \n \nfound that users would generally interact with the displays in case \nthey were disoriented, however it must be taken into account that \nthey might feel intrusive to the office occupant while using a \ndisplay for wayfinding assistance.  Results also demonstrate that \nHermes2 display owners are willing to allow their displays to \nshow wayfinding related content. \nThe feedback and insights we received from our studies \ndemonstrate positive user attitudes for an in-building wayfinding \nsystem that combines different technologies, i.e. the Hermes2 \ndigital displays and mobile phone technology as well as a digital \n2D map and a 3D fly-through as wayfinding content.  It has also \nallowed us to form an understanding of the supporting \ncomponents that are required for a wayfinding service in an in-\nbuilding environment, such as the Infolab21 building.   \nOur next formative study will combine the functionalities of the \ntwo versions of the Hermes2 Person Locator and investigate \nconcurrent use of the Hermes2 digital displays by users to receive \nwayfinding assistance along their route.  Furthermore, as part of \nfuture work, we aim to work with signage companies by exploring \nrequirements for wayfinding support in complex buildings such as \nhospitals with a focus on improving user experience. \n7.
