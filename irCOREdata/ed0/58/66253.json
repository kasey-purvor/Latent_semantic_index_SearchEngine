(2001) that \nthe crucial locus of neurological damage in neglect patients lies in the right \nsuperior temporal gyrus (STG), and not in the right posterior parietal cortex \n(PPC) as conventionally thought. Using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation \n(TMS), we first tested the involvement of the right STG in a task commonly \nused in the diagnosis of neglect, the landmark task. No evidence was found for \na critical involvement of the right STG in the processing of this task, though \nevidence was found for the involvement of the right PPC. In contrast, however, \nwhen we examined the effects of TMS on exploratory search, a double \ndissociation between right STG and right PPC was found. When the processing \nof conjunction items was required, involvement of the right PPC (and not STG) \nwas found, in accordance with previous research (Ellison et al., 2003). When \ndifficult exploratory search through feature items was required however, the \nright STG (not PPC) was found to be involved. A hitherto unknown role for \nright STG in visual search tasks was thus uncovered. These data suggest that \nconclusions about the area of brain damage resulting in neglect-like symptoms \nare highly dependent on the task used to diagnose them, with lesions in right \nPPC leading to deficits on the landmark task and conjunction visual search, and \nlesions in right STG resulting in deficits in feature based serial exploratory \nsearch tasks.  \n \n 2\nKeywords: temporal cortex, spatial neglect, visual search, landmark task, \nTMS. \n \nAbbreviations: STG= superior temporal gyrus; PPC= posterior parietal cortex; \nTMS= transcranial magnetic stimulation; rTMS= repetitive TMS; TPJ= \ntemporo-parietal junction; MCA= middle cerebral artery  \n 3\nIntroduction \nThe use of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) in the investigation of \nneurological deficits is not new (Walsh et al., 1998, Pascual-Leone et al., \n1994). However, neuropsychology and TMS differ in how they approach \nsolutions to the same problem, namely: \u201chow does the normal brain work?\u201d \nNeuropsychology identifies tasks that patients with particular lesions cannot \ndo, and so attributes the processing of such tasks to the damaged area. The \nobvious drawback to such an approach is that brain lesions are often large and \ndiffuse and the neuropsychologist is trying to make inferences about normal \nbrain function using an abnormal preparation. Also, testing of such patients can \noccur many years after the causative neurological insult. One of the many \nstrengths of the human brain is its ability to reorganise itself to regain functions \nlost (Robertson, 1999). Such an element of plasticity is an unknown in the \ninferences made about normal brain function following damage. TMS, on the \nother hand, approaches the same problem but from the opposite end of the \nexperimental spectrum. By the introduction of a brief period of neural disorder \nin a localised area, the role of a discrete region of cortex in the processing of a \nconcurrent task can be delineated. To this end, the symptomatic effects of \nlesions, the causes of which can only be postulated by neuropsychologists, can \nbe investigated with respect to the normal functioning brain (see Walsh and \nCowey, 2000 and Stewart et al., 2001 for review).  \n \n 4\nIt is within such a framework that the present study originated. The brain \nregions crucially associated with neglect have recently become a subject of \nintense dispute (Karnath and Himmelbach 2002a; Marshall et al., 2002) as a \nresult of a series of anatomical group studies. Based on studies of unselected \nmiddle cerebral artery (MCA) patients it has been generally found that the \ncrucial cortical area most commonly associated with neglect is the inferior right \nposterior parietal lobe (IPL) and the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) in \nparticular (Leibovitch et al., 1998; Mort et al., 2003, Vallar and Perani 1986; \nVallar 2001). However, a controversial paper by Karnath et al. (2001) \nsuggested that the crucial locus of brain damage that causes neglect symptoms \nwas not in the right posterior parietal cortex (PPC) at all, but in the middle of \nthe right superior temporal gyrus (STG), Brodmann\u2019s area 42), well anterior to \nthe TPJ. This conclusion was based on the analysis of lesion position in 25 \nnon-hemianopic neglect patients. It has, therefore, been criticized as an artefact \ndue to the exclusion of many typical neglect patients with associated visual \nfield deficits, resulting in an anterior shift of the apparent lesion focus (Mort et \nal., 2003). Indeed Mort et al.\u2019s group study reconfirmed the traditional findings \nby including hemianopic neglect patients.  \n \nHowever, taken together, these results do not necessarily exclude each other: \ninstead of supporting the idea of one single crucial cortical region associated \nwith neglect, they rather suggest the possibility of (at least) two areas \ndepending on the absence or presence of hemianopia as well as on the \n 5\nfunctional definition of neglect by the screening tasks used. The latter argument \nbecomes evident given that in Karnath et al.\u2019s study the neglect screening was \nstrongly biased towards tasks involving visual search (cancellation and scene \ncopying), while excluding line bisection. In contrast Mort et al.\u2019s patients were \nassessed in more traditional fashion with both line bisection and cancellation \ntasks. However a substantial number of these patients showed a double \ndissociation between line bisection and cancellation. It is now hotly debated \nwhether the contrasting anatomical results reflect specific functional task \ndemands involving different neuronal components in neglect or methodological \ndifferences in patient selection or lesion analysis (Mort et al., 2004, Karnath et \nal., 2004). As there is no definite answer, it would seem a potentially useful \ncontribution to the debate for TMS studies to test the functional role of the right \nSTG using line bisection as well as a visual search paradigm.  \n  \nA perceptual version of the traditional line bisection paradigm is provided by \nthe landmark task (in which the subject is asked make judgements about \nwhether pre-bisected lines are bisected to the left or right of centre: (Milner et \nal., 1992, 1993; Bisiach et al., 1998). Biases in the landmark task, like those \nseen in the line bisection task, have often been taken to reflect distorted spatial \nperception in neglect patients (Milner et al., 1998; Bisiach et al., 1998). It has \nalready been shown by Fierro et al. (2000) that it is possible to induce similar \ncontralateral effects on the landmark task in healthy subjects using event-\nrelated repetitive-pulse TMS (rTMS) over right posterior parietal cortex (PPC). \n 6\nThis was further investigated by Bjoertomt et al. (2002), who found that the \ninvolvement of PPC in the task was restricted to near space. If, then, rTMS to \nthe right STG results in similar neglect-like symptoms in the landmark task, \nclear support would be provided for Karnath et al.\u2019s theory.  \n  \nThe other traditionally sensitive measure of neglect involves the use of \ncancellation tasks of various kinds, i.e. tasks involving the search for multiple \ntargets in an array (see, e.g., Robertson and Marshall, 1993). It appears that \nbisection and cancellation tasks may tap different aspects of the neglect \nsyndrome, given that they show mutual double dissociations among individual \nneglect patients (Halligan and Marshall, 1992), and correlate poorly together \nacross the neglect population (Ferber and Karnath, 2001). A number of formal \nstudies of search performance have been undertaken to explore the cancellation \nimpairment (e.g. Karnath and Niemeier, 2002b; Behrmann et al., 1997; \nKarnath et al., 1998). In the light of this work, we carried out a second \nexperiment in which we sought to test the involvement of the right STG in \nvisual search tasks. Much is already known about the involvement of right PPC \nin such tasks, with current TMS evidence arguing strongly for its critical \ninvolvement being in the processing of conjunction items in space (Ellison et \nal., 2003). On the other hand, other evidence (including from functional MRI) \nhas suggested that the critical determinant of brain processing in visual search \ntasks lay along the dimension of the difficulty of search, and thus the attention \nrequired for its processing, and that this aspect involved right PPC (e.g. Nobre \n 7\net al., 2003). One of the problems with many previous discussions of visual \nsearch is that there has been a conflation between \u2018difficult\/easy\u2019, \n\u2018serial\/parallel\u2019 and \u2018conjunction\/feature\u2019 search tasks. But in fact the search \nstimulus used (feature versus conjunction) is not 100% correlated with the \nsearch pattern required to find it. Specifically, one can construct the following \nfour distinct search tasks: parallel (easy) feature, serial (hard) feature, parallel \n(easy) conjunction and serial (hard) conjunction. Thus, as Ellison et al. point \nout, it is possible to have feature search arrays that require a serial search and \nconjunction search arrays that only require parallel search (Treisman and \nGelade, 1980). The literature on visual search in neglect has been beset to some \ndegree with the same conflation. Using a serial search for a unique feature \n(inaccurately named a conjunction search to remain \u201cconsistent with literature\u201d \ninterchanging serial search with conjunction tasks), Behrmann et al. (2004) \nalso agree that \u201cthe binary distinction between preattentive\/featural and \nattentive\/conjunction processing does not obviously hold\u201d in neglect patients. \nEllison et al. (2003) attempted to separate these different aspects of visual \nsearch with respect to the parietal cortex using rTMS. They showed that right \nPPC is involved in the processing of any search for conjunction items even if \nthis search was extremely easy and parallel (< 5 ms per item). rTMS has \ntherefore shown that the critical involvement of right PPC is in conjunction \nsearch in space, irrespective of difficulty. In contrast, rTMS of this region does \nnot have any effect even on very difficult serial (50ms per item) feature search. \n 8\nTherefore we would predict that the relative pattern of difficulty neglect \npatients have should be related lawfully to the anatomy of their damage. \n \nIn the present study we thus attempt a complementary approach to lesion \nstudies, using TMS to investigate the functional involvement of the right STG \nin tasks related to the two traditional neglect paradigms. As an experimental \ncomparison, and in order to replicate earlier studies, we have also examined the \neffects of TMS to the right PPC as well in each case. \n 9\nMethod \nSubjects \nFive healthy subjects, aged 21-36, with normal or corrected to normal vision \n(all right handed; 2 female, 3 male), participated in all tasks. Subjects gave \ntheir signed informed consent in accordance with Durham University Ethics \nAdvisory Committee, and could leave the experiment at any point. Subject \nselection complied with current guidelines for rTMS research (Wassermann, \n1998).  \n \nStimuli \nAll stimuli were presented on a 320mm x 240mm monitor driven by a \nPentium-4 PC programmed in E-Prime (Psychology Software Tools, Inc). \nSubjects were seated comfortably 57.5 cm away from the screen with the \ncentre of the screen at pupil level. The subjects\u2019 head and trunk sagittal midline \nwas aligned with the centre of the screen, and head position was controlled by a \nchinrest. Except for the light from the PC screen the room was darkened, and \nthe stimuli were equiluminant at 120 cd\/m2. \n \nLandmark Task \nThe landmark paradigm used in this experiment was a modified version of that \nused by Bjoertomt et al. (2002) original experiment. Each stimulus consisted of \na symmetrically or asymmetrically bisected white horizontal line on a black \nbackground. The lines were of four different lengths ranging from 20\u00b0 to 23\u00b0. \n 10\nIn one-third of trials the line was symmetrically bisected by a short vertical line \n(2\u00b0 visual angle long). Both long and short lines were symmetrically bisected in \norder to eliminate length processing as a strategy. In the remainder of trials the \nline was asymmetrically bisected to make either the left or right side longer by \neither 1\u00b0 or 2\u00b0 of visual angle. All lines were 0.1\u00b0 thick. The stimuli were \nalways presented with the bisection mark at the head and body midline of the \nsubject. \n \nA central fixation cross appeared for 500ms followed by the appearance of the \nstimulus for 300ms, which was immediately followed by a mask (30\u00b0 x 30\u00b0), \nwhich then remained present until the subject responded. The mask consisted \nof a thick (0.2\u00b0) horizontal line and central vertical bar, which in combination \nalways covered the previously displayed stimulus. Subjects were asked to \nrespond in one of two ways, the first instruction being \u201cWhich was longer: Left \nor Right?\u201d, and the second being \u201cWhich was shorter: Left or Right?\u201d (see \nFigure 1). Each instruction was tested in separate blocks of trials with adequate \npractice given for each. Responses were made on a button box with the left \nbutton denoting left and the right button denoting right. Subjects were asked to \nrespond as quickly as they could but not to sacrifice accuracy for speed. Inter-\ntrial interval was 4000ms. \n  \nFigure 1 about here please \n \n 11\nVisual Search Tasks \nThree visual search tasks were used (see Figure 2). Two of the tasks (feature \nand conjunction) required serial search (>10ms\/item) and constitute \u201chard\u201d \nsearch tasks in terms of difficulty. The third task (feature) was a simple \u201cpop-\nout\u201d search with a parallel search function (< 5ms\/item) and is termed \u201ceasy\u201d \nsearch. The target could appear anywhere in the 8 x 6 array of virtual boxes on \nthe screen. \n \nIn the feature tasks, the target was unique amongst distractors whereas in the \nconjunction task, both the orientation and colour of the target was shared \namongst distractors. All items subtended 2\u00b0 x 2\u00b0 visual angle and were \npresented against a black background. Subjects were asked to respond as \nquickly and as accurately as possible on a button box (left button for target-\npresent, right button for target-absent) to indicate the presence or absence of \nthe target. Each trial was preceded by a central fixation cross (0.5\u00b0 x 0.5\u00b0) for \n500ms followed immediately by the stimulus array. There were 8 items in each \narray. In trials where the target was absent, an extra distractor was displayed to \neliminate counting as a strategy. The target was present in 50% of trials, and \nthere was never more than one target. The visual array remained present until \nresponse or for 1500ms, whichever was shorter, and the inter-trial interval was \n4000ms. \n \n 12\nFigure 2 about here please \n \nThe hard feature task required search for a white L shaped target amongst 180\u00b0 \nrotated L shapes and 270\u00b0 rotated L shapes. The easy feature task required \nsearch for a white slash (\/), amongst white backslashes (\\). The hard \nconjunction task required search for a red slash amongst red backslashes and \ngreen slashes (see Figure 2).  \n \nTMS \nA Magstim\u2122 Model 200 was used and stimulation was applied at 65% of the \nstimulator\u2019s maximum power. This level of stimulation is greater than the \nthresholds required to induce movement (over motor cortex) or the perception \nof phosphenes (over visual cortex). \n \nTwo sites of stimulation were used, right superior temporal gyrus, STG, and \nright posterior parietal cortex, PPC. The STG site (Brodmann\u2019s area 42, the \nmain area of lesion overlap in Karnath et al.\u2019s analysis) was located using \nframeless stereotaxy (BrainSight\u2122, Rogue Research, Montreal, Canada) at the \nbeginning of the session. This area is located approximately 1 cm posterior to \nvertex and 14cm lateral on the scalp (see Figure 3). The PPC site was identified \nby using a hunting procedure with the hard conjunction task, as described in \nAshbridge et al. (1997) and used by Bjoertomt et al. (2002) in their \ninvestigation of the landmark task. This site lies posteriorly within the typical \n 13\narea of parietal cortex damage causes neglect. In the hunting procedure, 10 \ntrials of TMS are given to each site in a 3 x 3 grid (each point 1 cm apart, see \nFigure 3) around a central point 9 cm dorsal to the mastoid-inion and 6cm \nlateral. The \u201chotspot\u201d for activation is denoted by a 100ms increase in reaction \ntime over the trials in which no TMS was administered. This functionally \nlocalised position was then verified using BrainSight\u2122 (see Figure 4) before \nthe experimental procedure. \n \nFigure 3 about here please \n \nFigure 4 about here please \n \nRight STG stimulation was applied using a small (50mm) \u2018figure of 8\u2019 coil \nplaced tangential to the skull. Due to the likelihood of magnetic pulses in this \narea (just above the ear) causing superficial facial muscle twitches that might \ninterfere with the processing of the visual task, the frequency used was 4 Hz for \n500 ms. This resulted in 2 pulses per trial. Right PPC TMS was applied in the \nmore conventional manner, with a 70 mm figure of 8 coil at 10 Hz for 500 ms, \nresulting in 5 pulses per trial. In the no-TMS condition, the TMS coil \ndischarged the pulses near to, but directed away from, the subject\u2019s head. \nTherefore, the audible effect of TMS was always present but without the \naccompanying pulse delivery to the cortex.  \n \n 14\nAt each site, the train of pulses began at presentation of the visual stimulus \n(post-fixation). The landmark task was tested at each stimulation site in 8 \nblocks x 12 trials (alternate TMS and no-TMS blocks, randomised across \nsubjects) for each instruction (\u2018which is longer?\u2019 and \u2018which is shorter?\u2019). Each \nvisual search task was also tested in 8 x 12 trials at each stimulation site. The \norder of all tasks was randomised across subjects to preclude practice effects. \nThree testing sessions (one per week), lasting approximately 1.5 hrs, were \nrequired per subject, each of whom completed all tasks. \n 15\nResults \nLandmark task \nAccuracy with asymmetrically bisected lines was always above 97% and there \nwas no significant difference between error rates on TMS and no-TMS trials (3 \nfactor [site of stimulation x line length x instruction] repeated measures \nANOVA). TMS over either site had no significant effect on reaction time, \nwhether lines were either asymmetrically or symmetrically bisected (3 factor \n[hemispace x instruction x TMS condition] repeated measures ANOVA).  \n \nThe most illuminating results in this task relate to the pattern of subjects\u2019 \nresponses when lines were centrally bisected. When TMS was applied to the \nPPC, subjects responded that the left side of the line was shorter in 20% more \ntrials than without TMS (t = 4.080, df = 4, p = 0.027, paired t-test). When they \nwere asked which side was longer, they responded that the right side was \nlonger in 22% more TMS trials than in no-TMS trials (t = 6.326, df = 4, p = \n0.003). Subjects therefore exhibited, with PPC TMS, a tendency to \nunderestimate the leftward segment of the lines, as in contralateral neglect (see \nFigure 5). \n \nIn contrast, there were no significant differences in response patterns when \nTMS was applied over the right STG (t = 0.214, df = 4, p = 0.841, \u2018longer\u2019 \ncondition; t = 0.412, df = 4, p = 0.701, \u2018shorter\u2019 condition) (see Figure 5). \n \n 16\nFigure 5 about here please \n \nVisual search \nThe visual search tasks displayed a clear contrast between the effects of TMS \nover STG and PPC on target-present reaction times. There was a significant \nmain effect (3 factor [site of stimulation x task x TMS] repeated measures \nANOVA) for task (F(2,8) = 32.772, p < 0.001) and a significant interaction \nbetween the three factors (F = 15.911, p = 0.002). Post hoc Bonferroni tests \nrevealed that TMS over STG had a significant effect on search reaction time \nfor the target in the hard feature search task (t = 8.039, df = 4, p = 0.001) but \nnot in the easy feature task (t = 0.516, df = 4, p = 0.633) or the hard \nconjunction task (t = 0.228, df = 4, p = 0.831). Conversely, TMS over the PPC \nhad a significant effect on reaction time in the serial conjunction task (t = \n3.790, df = 4, p = 0.019), but not in the hard feature task (t = 1.186, df = 4, p = \n0.301), or the easy feature task (t = 0.666, df = 4, p = 0.542) (see Figure 6). \n \nFigure 6 about here please \n \nIn a two factor [task x hemispace] repeated measures ANOVA (using TMS\/no \nTMS scores) for each stimulation site separately, there was no significant \ndifference between TMS effects for targets presented in left or right hemispace \nunder either STG or PPC stimulation (STG: F(1, 4) = 0.196, p = 0.681; PPC: \nF(1.4) = 0.026, p = 0.880). Error rates in all visual search tasks were less than 2% \n 17\nand there was no significant difference between error rates for TMS and no-\nTMS trials.  \n \n \n 18\nDiscussion \nPrevious findings of contralesional neglect-like symptoms on the landmark task \nfollowing TMS over right PPC (Fierro et al., 2000; Bjoertomt et al., 2002) \nwere replicated in this study, which is also in line with recent fMRI data (Fink \net al,. 2000, 2001). However, no such effect on the landmark task was found \nwith TMS over right STG. This finding might seem to be inconsistent with \nKarnath et al. (2001)\u2019s view that Brodmann\u2019s area 42 is the main locus of \nneurological damage underlying neglect. \n  \nHowever, as discussed in the introduction, neglect as a condition can be \ndiagnosed in many ways, and neglect patients are known to be impaired in a \nvariety of different tasks (see Bisiach and Vallar, 2000; Robertson and \nMarshall, 1993). In fact, the existence of double dissociations between tasks in \nneglect patients led Ferber and Karnath (2001), like Halligan and Marshall \n(1992) before them, to question neglect as a \u201cmeaningful theoretical entity\u201d. \nThese indications of the multifarious nature of neglect are borne out by the \nresults of the present study, in which we found that a particular exploratory \nsearch task revealed an involvement of the right STG, but not the PPC. More \nspecifically, we found involvement of the right STG in a difficult visual search \nfor feature items, though not for conjunction items, nor for simple \u201cpop-out\u201d \nsearch.  \n \n 19\nIt is clear that these visual search results cannot be explained by a generalised \nTMS effect, since the effects were modulated by task: i.e. stimulation at each \nsite caused processing deficits in one visual search task but not in the other \ntwo. Effects cannot be explained by the difference in stimulation parameters \nbetween areas either. As previously mentioned, the position of right STG on \nthe scalp necessitated a lower frequency of stimulation in order to minimise \nmuscle twitch and eye blinks which would impede the subject\u2019s ability to \nperform the task. Of course, if we could not find effects using these lower \nstimulation parameters over right STG in any of our tasks, then we could not be \nsure that our stimulation of this site was sufficient to cause a disruptive effect \non processing. In practice, however, 4Hz did allow us to induce clear task-\nspecific disruption to processing in right STG, presumably at the critical time at \nwhich it is active in the processing of the task. It is clearly a possibility that if it \nwere possible to stimulate right STG with 10Hz, these effects would be even \nstronger, as brain activity at the critical time would no doubt be disrupted to a \nmore selective degree. However, the parameters we used were nonetheless \nsensitive enough to detect clear differential effects, thus allowing us to \ndemonstrate an all important double dissociation in our results. It is very \nunlikely that a higher frequency of stimulation over right STG would \u201cinduce\u201d \nhitherto uncovered effects in the landmark task, as no deficits in processing \nwere observed at all with 4Hz stimulation which is sufficiently effective to \nreveal right STG involvement in other visual tasks. This view is supported by \nour pilot experiments which revealed that 4Hz stimulation over right PPC \n 20\nreplicated our results in the 10Hz stimulation condition, although the observed \neffects were not large enough to reach significance. Using 4Hz in the landmark \ntask, subjects underestimated the length of the left line 18% more than without \nTMS (as opposed to an average 25% difference with 10Hz stimulation). In the \nsearch conditions, 4Hz TMS over PPC induced a 36.25ms increase in reaction \ntime in the hard conjunction condition (c.f. 76.47ms increase with 10hz). \nAlthough it is possible to achieve significant increases in reaction time in our \nconjunction search task with single pulses delivered at 100ms post stimulus \nonset (Ashbridge et al., 1997), presumably 4Hz stimulation does not cover this \ntime frame as effectively as 10Hz would.  \n \nA common concern with TMS experiments is that the inferences made about \nthe stimulated area\u2019s involvement in the processing of a task may be unfounded \ngiven the spread of current following a TMS pulse. Current does indeed spread \nto adjacent cortex and along neurological pathways (Ilmoniemi et al, 1997). \nHowever, it is unlikely that this secondary activation is ever strong enough to \ncause disruption of cognitive processing in these areas (Nikulin et al., 2003).  \n \nAlso, effects cannot be explained by practice effects modulating performance \nin our visual search tasks. The order of the testing sessions was randomised \nacross weeks to preclude any practice effects, which are typically quite strong \nfor visual search tasks. The order of the tasks was randomised within each \ntesting session and each testing session used a different site of stimulation. \n 21\nHowever, even with such controls some differences (albeit non-significant) \nbetween no-TMS reaction times are evident. It is worth pointing out however \nthat the final failsafe in this design is that no-TMS reaction times were taken on \neach testing day, therefore if subjects were faster on Day 2 for example, their \nTMS reaction times on that day were directly comparable with their no TMS \nreaction times collected in the same session. \n \nAlthough it has been postulated from functional imaging (Hayakawa et al., \n2003) and neuropsychological (Humphreys et al., 1992a, b) data that the \ntemporal cortex is involved in feature search, this is the first demonstration of a \ncritical involvement of the superior temporal gyrus in this kind of processing. It \nis notable also that the right STG is not involved in the processing of simple \npop-out search; hence its involvement is not based on the presence of single-\nfeature items per se. A more difficult spatial search is required. This is \nevidence that highly parallel feature search is processed earlier in the visual \nsystem than either of the sites we have studied. In contrast, Ellison et al. (2003) \nfound that the right PPC was involved in the processing of conjunction items \nno matter how easy the search was.  \n  \nIt is therefore evident from our visual search results that right STG is involved \nin certain spatial aspects of visual processing. It is notable, however, that \nasymmetrical (i.e. contralesional hemispace) effects were not manifested for \neither the PPC or STG stimulation in the visual search tasks, although they \n 22\nwere in the landmark experiment. Aside from the obvious difference of lesion \nvolume between neglect patients after MCA infarction and the more focal \nTMS-induced disturbances, this may be due to three reasons. The first reason \ncould be the special characteristics of neglect itself. It has been shown that the \nfailure of neglect patients to orient and respond to contralesional stimuli occurs \nnot only with respect to egocentric-reference frames e.g. where left and right \nare defined with respect to the sagittal plane of the body or body parts (Hornak, \n1992; Karnath, 1997; Karnath et al., 1998) but also with respect to object-\ncentred reference frames (Driver et al., 1994; Tipper and Behrmann, 1996; \nBehrmann and Tipper, 1999). In the latter case left and right are defined by \nobject features and consequently neglect can be observed independently of the \nobject\u2019s location within egocentric space. In this context, our findings of absent \nlateralized reaction time effects despite higher overall latencies may suggest \nthat we reproduced an object-centred deficit. That is, if each fixated object\u2019s \nprocessing were impaired, there would be the same degree of reaction-time \ndeficit for targets appearing in both the left and right hemifields. This finding \nmay be peculiar to TMS-induced effects, in mimicking a rather atypical form \nof neglect that is only sometimes present in patients (e.g. Driver, 1999). This \ntheory could be tested by using the same stimuli but presenting them in a way \nso as not to allow eye movements (as in the landmark task). If we could \ndemonstrate contralesional TMS effects in this case, it would provide support \nfor an object-centred interpretation of our results.  \n  \n 23\nThe second reason stems from the irrefutable fact that following neurological \ninsult, the brain is very efficient in reorganising itself (Robertson, 1999). In the \nnormal brain, there is evidence that the right PPC has a dominant role in \ndistributing spatial attention on both sides of visual space (Nobre et al., 1997, \nCorbetta et al., 1993). Following a lesion to the right PPC, the left PPC may by \ndefault take over such processing (cf. Luria, 1963) even though due to its \nlimited abilities, only the contralateral hemispace can be processed (Corbetta et \nal., 1993; but see Corbetta et al., 1998). This would result in the common \nhappenstance of left hemispatial neglect following a right hemisphere lesion in \npatients tested after their damage occurred (as first proposed by Heilman and \nVan Den Abell, 1980). Although patients may experience contralateral neglect \neven minutes after a stroke, perhaps those few minutes are crucial for the \nswitch to left-hemisphere control. In contrast, the very brief stimulation period \nof TMS means that no such time window is available for the switch of control \nto occur.  \n  \nThe third possible reason why we did not uncover contralateral neglect in the \nvisual search tasks may be a function of the decision demands of the task. The \neffects seen in the landmark task were contralateral and in this case the \nsubject\u2019s response was explicitly based on spatial categories relevant in neglect \ni.e. \u201cleft\u201d or \u201cright\u201d. However, in our visual search tasks the response was \n\u201ctarget-present\u201d or \u201ctarget-absent\u201d. It may be that the processing of a present or \nabsent response requires more global processing, less spatially intensive than \n 24\nthe search required if the subject is asked to indicate which side of space the \ntarget appeared in (i.e. detection vs localisation). Requiring a left\/right response \nwould more closely resemble the directional nature of responses in clinical \ncancellation tasks, and might thereby reveal contralateral effects from TMS. In \nsupport of this idea, Behrmann et al. (1997) showed that patients with neglect \nhave a deficient search pattern biased to the right hemispace. Such a search \npattern may be sufficient to execute a target-present\/target-absent search in \nboth hemispaces, but contra-lesional effects may be seen in a left\/right search. \nThis can be easily tested using TMS. \n \nIn conclusion, we have found some support for Karnath et al.\u2019s (2001) seminal \nclaim for the importance of STG damage in the causation of neglect. We have \ndemonstrated a critical involvement of right STG in a hard feature visual search \ntask. Given the double dissociation we have found between task used and brain \narea stimulated, it is clear that the detection of neglect is likely to be highly \ndependent on the task used. Indeed our results show that the right PPC has a \nkey role in processing of both the landmark and hard conjunction tasks. These \nfindings are partially consistent with reports of an earlier lesion study in 21 \nneglect patients (Binder et al. 1992) showing that patients with lesions in the \nright temporo-parieto-occipital area are frequently impaired in cancellation as \nwell as line bisection. In contrast, the maximal lesion overlap in patients who \nwere only impaired in cancellation was found in pre-rolandic regions including \nthe prefrontal cortex, insula and adjacent subcortical areas. One reason for this \n 25\nlatter result may be that in contrast to the search paradigms used in our study, \nthe Mesulam cancellation task used by Binder et al. might have involved a \nspatial working memory component, which has been shown to be impaired in \nneglect patients with frontal lesions (Walker et al. 1998). The interesting \nquestion that arises from our results is what would be found in patients with \ndifferent posterior lesions using the specific tasks used here. We would predict \nthat patients with PPC lesions should be more likely to have deficits on the \nlandmark task and in conjunction visual search, whereas those with right STG \nlesions should be more likely to have deficits in difficult exploratory single-\nfeature search.  \n 26\nReferences \n \nAshbridge E, Walsh V, Cowey A.
