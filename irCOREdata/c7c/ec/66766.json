Arguing that \u2018software-\nsorting\u2019 techniques are now being widely applied in efforts to try and separate \nprivileged and marginalised groups and places across a wide range of sectors and \ndomains, the paper analyses recent research addressing three examples of \nsoftware-sorting in practice. These address physical and electronic mobility systems, \nonline Geographical Information Systems (GISs), and face-recognition Closed Circuit \nTelevision (CCTV) systems covering city streets. The paper finishes by identifying \nresearch and policy implications of the diffusion of software-sorted geographies \nwithin which computerised code continually orchestrates inequality through \ntechnological systems embedded within urban environments . \n \nKey Words \n \nCode    Software-Sorting    Surveillance   Unbundling   Inequality   Remediation   \nMobilities   Geodemographics   CCTV \nI Introduction: Code and the Remediation of Inequality \n \n\"The modern city exists as a haze of software instructions\"  \n(Amin and Thrift, 2003, 125). \n \n\u201cValues, opinions and rhetoric are frozen into code\"  \n(Bowker and Star, 1999, 35) \n \n \nComputer software mediates, saturates and sustains contemporary capitalist \nsocieties. Enrolled into complex technoscientific and machinic systems, stretched \nacross time-space, a vast universe of code provides the hidden background to the \nfunctioning and ordering of such societies (Lessig, 1999). The flows, mobilities, and \ntransactions; the folded geographies of inclusion and exclusion; the construction, \nconsumption and experience of place; the very operation of distanciated webs of \nproduction, distribution, and consumption \u2013 all, very literally, are now performed -- at \nleast in part -- through the continuous agency of vast realms of computer software.  \n \nWith computerised systems now actually becoming the \u2018ordinary\u2019 socio-technical \nworld in many contemporary societies (Amin and Thrift, 2002), code orchestrates a \nwidening array of public, private, and public-private spheres and mobility, logistics \nand service systems and spaces. These are based on ubiquitous, pervasive, inter-\nlinked arrays of computerised spaces, systems, and equipment which increasingly \nblends seamlessly into the wider urban environment (Thrift, 2004a, Cuff, 2002). The \ntechnosocial complexes of code, and their supportive hardware and organizational \nsystems,  have variously been described in terms of a kind of \u2018immanent domain\u2019 \n(Cuff, 2002), \u2018ubiquitous computing\u2019 (Hunter, 2002), an \u2018invisible city\u2019 (Latour and \nHermand, 1998), a \u2018surveillant assemblage\u2019 (Haggerty and Ericson, 2000), or a \nproliferating array of \u2018Automated Socio-Technical Environments\u2019 (Lianos and \nDouglas, 2000). However one describes them, code-based technologised \nenvironments continuously and invisibly classify, standardise, and demarcate rights, \nprivileges, inclusions, exclusions, mobilities and normative social judgements across \nvast, distanciated, domains (Graham and Wood, 2003, Bowler and Star, 1999, Thrift \nand French, 2002).  \n \nGiven all this, it is curious that remarkably little attention had been paid to \"the \nmillions of lines of code that have come to run cities as computing power has \nincreased and as many former bodily practices have been written into code\" (Amin \nand Thrift, 2002, 125). What Nigel Thrift and Shaun French (2002, 309) term the \nautomatic production of space, through the simultaneous enaction of multiple, \ninteracting worlds of computer software, remains largely ignored in human \ngeography and social science more generally. Sunk in the taken for granted \nbackground of everyday life, these worlds of code exert their power over the \ngeographies and lifeworlds of capitalism continuously and powerfully, but with \nscarcely any analytical or day-to-day scrutiny. This invisibility contrasts markedly with \nthe burgeoning library of volumes  which now exist which address the connections \nbetween new technologies and urban life more generally (Graham, 2004a).  Thus, it \nseems, \"code is in some sense invisible compared with its computer carapace\" \n(Amin and Thrift, 2003, 125). \n \nAs the opaque and esoteric worlds of code operate to directly shape the practices \nand possibilities of everyday life in ever extending ways, so the analytical challenge \nis thus to excavate the worlds of code as critical political, social and geographical \nsites requiring urgent understanding, regulation and intervention. \"Software \nchallenges us to understand new forms of technologies politics and new practices of \npolitical invention, legibility and intervention that we are only beginning to \ncomprehend as political at all\" (Thrift an French, 2002, 331). Encouragingly, a range \nof recent work in geography, sociology, technology studies and allied disciplines, is \nstarting to make real progress in unearthing the ways in which contemporary \ncapitalist societies are continuously brought into being through code. Such work \nreflects a broad shift in social scientific analyses of new media and information \ntechnologies. Such work has turned away from discussions suggesting that such \ntechnologies offer access to some \u2018virtual\u2019 domain which is somehow distinct and \nseparable, in some binary way, from  the \u2018real\u2019 spaces and places of cities and \nmaterial urban life (Woolgar, 2002). In their place, much more nuanced and \nsophisticated approaches are emerging. These stress that new technologies are \nintimately involved in the fine-grained and subtle transformations, or \u2018remediations\u2019, \nof place-and space-based social worlds (Bolter and Grusin, 2000, Graham, 2004a,b, \nHaythornwaite and Wellman, 2002). Far from being separated domains, then, such \nperspectives underline that the coded worlds of the \u2018virtual\u2019 actually work to \ncontinually constitute, structure, and facilitate the place-based practices of the \nmaterial world (Dodge and Kitchen, 2004, 198).   Castells (1996, 373) calls this the \nshift from \u2018virtual reality\u2019 to \u2018real virtuality\u2019 (see Dodge and Kitchin, 2004). \n \nThe purpose of this paper is to provide a critical review of  emerging work on the \nrelationships between the worlds of code and human geography. This is undertaken \nas a means of taking stock of this emerging body of work and to suggest directions \nfor future research. The specific focus here is on the ways in which software code \nactively shapes and structures social and geographical inequalities within and \nbetween places in a wide variety of ways. In what follows, I review emerging \nresearch which addresses three particularly important domains where social and \neconomic inequalities within and between places are directly mediated, and shaped, \nby hidden worlds of code. These address, in turn: spaces of physical and electronic \nmobility, the production and consumption of urban neighbourhoods via online \nGeographical Information Systems (or GISs), and the growth of facial-recognition \nbased Closed Circuit Television (or CCTV) covering city streets. Before reviewing \nthese three bodies of work, however, it is necessary to place coded geographies of \ninclusion and exclusion within their wider political economic contexts.  \n \nII  \u2018One Person\u2019s Infrastructure is Another\u2019s Difficulty\u2019:  \nSoftware Sorting and Political Economies of \u2018Unbundling\u2019 \n \nTo capture the ways in which software code mediates contemporary social worlds \nautomatically (i.e. with little immediate human supervision), with very little delay (i.e. \nin real time), and continuously, I coin the term \u2018software-sorting\u2019 (Graham, 2004c). \nSoftware-sorting is a critical landscape of power within what Jeremy Rifkin (2001) \nhas termed the \u2018age of access\u2019. Rifkin uses this term to describe the way in which \nindividual and collective life chances are shaped increasingly  by their treatment \nwithin computer-controlled, customised, service domains. These, Rifkin argues, are \nincraesingly orchestrated through technological networks which are rigidly structured \nusing consumerist criteria. Such systems enrol selected, privileged users whilst \nprecisely controlling access for those deemed unprofitable, risky, or deviant.  \n \nSoftware-sorting is the means through such selective access is organised (Graham \nand Wood, 2003). Such processes operate  through a vast universe of what Michel \nCallon (1986) has termed \u2018obligatory passage points\u2019. These are particular \ntopological spaces within socio-technical systems through which actors have to \n\u2018pass\u2019 in order that the system actually functions in the way that dominant actors \ndesire. The obligatory passage points within software-sorting systems involve a \nburgeoning array of subscriptions, passwords, service entitlements, physical and \nvirtual access control points, electronically surveilled passage-points and transaction \nsystems, automated, biometric judgements, and normative databases  -- all of which \nare enacted and sustained through code and computerised systems (see Lyon, \n2003a).  \n \nSoftware-sorting captures the crucial and often ignored role of code in directly, \nautomatically, and continuously  allocating social or geographical access to all sorts \nof critical goods, services, life chances, or mobility opportunities to certain social \ngroups or geographical areas, at the direct expense of others (Lyon, 2003b). Such \nan emphasis is made more important by the ways in which software-sorting \ntechniques are currently being overwhelmingly mobilised to help restructure and \nrecommodify many previously \u2018public\u2019 domains of everyday life within western \ncapitalist nations, as part of the elaboration of neoliberal models of state construction \nand service provision (Graham and Marvin, 2001).  Of course, this is far from being \nsome simple, deterministic, or one-dimensional technological shift. But without \nsoftware sorting techniques, many major infrastructural and material transformations, \nbased on the application of neoliberal political paradigms to a wide range of social \nand economic contexts, would be all but impossible. Examples include electronic \nroad pricing, \u2018bypass\u2019 immigration based on biometric IDs, \u2018virtual\u2019 and competitive \nelectricity markets, internet systems where the \u2018packets\u2019 of data are individually \nprioritised, geodemographic  consumption systems, facial recognition closed circuit \ntelevision on city streets, and electronic tagging systems for low-level offenders.  The \nwidening application of software-sorting techniques thus needs to be seen as a \ncrucial, facilitating dimension in the broad shift from Keynesian welfare states  and \npublic domains to \u2018splintered\u2019, post-Keynesian regimes of infrastructure, service, and \nspace production and consumption (Graham and Marvin, 2001, Brenner, 2004).  \n \nLianos (2003, 424) argues that this transition involves a broad process of \ndesocialisation. In this, discourses or paradigms emphasising universal or quasi-\nuniversal rights of access or consumption, based on Keynesian ideas of citizenship, \ncross-subsidy, monopolistic control, universal service, and electromechanical or \nbureaucratic technologies, are being replaced -- or at least complemented \u2013 by new \nsoftware-sorted modalities of power.   Often intensely individualised and \ncommodified, the immense transactional flexibility and surveillance power of \nsoftware-sorting means that the essential infrastructures, spaces and services of \neveryday can thus undergo a process of \u2018mass-customisation\u2019 (Andrejevic, 2003) or \n\u2018unbundling\u2019 (Graham and Marvin, 2001).  \n \nIn essence, then, software-sorting is being overwhelmingly used to undermine the \nclassic characteristics of urban public goods,1  allowing these limits to \nrecommodification to be swept away (Pinch, 1985). Packaged, delivered through \nconsumerist markets, sorted through the endless distinctions of geodemographic \nprofiles, and linked closely to the surveillance of actual consume behaviours and \ndesires, fully unbundled service and access packages thus become possible. Under \npressure to maintain of increase profits, within  the context of widespread \nprivatisation and liberalisation, service packages geared towards more lucrative \nmarket niches can thus to be customised and \u2018splintered\u2019 from the wider societal \nfabric though software-sorting techniques  (Graham and Marvin, 2001, Andrejevic, \n2003). At the same time, less lucrative users of streets, mobility systems, services, \nelectronic communications grids, and places can be electronically (and\/or physically) \npushed away and marginalised, again through software-sorting and machinations of \ncode.  \n \nSuch unbundling can allow privileged users to enjoy enhanced mobility, reliability, \nservice quality, quality of life, or (real or perceived)  freedom from risk, crime, \ncongestion, or contact with (sometimes demonised or humiliated) Others (Young, \n1999).  \"The mobility of some can\u201d, in short, \u201cimmobilise others\" (Cresswell, 2000, \n21). \u201cOne person\u2019s infrastructure\u201d becomes \u201canother\u2019s difficulty\u201d (Leigh-Star, 1999, \n390). Crucially, however, because most processes of software sorting are actually \n                                            \n1 1These are, first, the concept of 'joint-supply' (or non-rivalness) meaning that if a service, such as \nthe national defense or legal system, is supplied to one person, it can also be supplied to all other \npersons at no extra cost. The second concept, 'non-excludability', means that once a supply has been \nbuilt a user can not be prevented from consuming the service (e.g. traditional city streets), including \ninfrastructure such as rural roads. Third, there is 'non-rejectability'. This means that once a service is \nsupplied it must be equally consumed by all, even those who do not wish to consume it  (e.g. traffic \ncontrol systems) (Pinch, 1985) \n \ninvisible from the point of the users, these prioritisations are often not evident to \neither the favoured groups or places, or the marginalised ones. \n \nIt is crucial to stress, then, that the \u2018mobile publics\u2019 inhabiting the extending \nneoliberal geographies of flow and access that are the focus of so much recent work \nin geography, anthropology, and sociology (Lyon, 2003b, Sheller, 2004, Cresswell, \n2001), are publics that are often prioritised, enacted, and kept apart, by hidden \nworlds of software-sorting.  Certain caveats must be raised here, however. Such \nattempts at separation or secession are never simple, \u2018top-down\u2019 and dualistic. \nTransgressions of categories are almost always possible; asserted boundaries are \nalmost always porous to some extent (see, for example, Bloomfield, 2001). The \ntransitions surrounding software-sorting are also not simple, deterministic results of \nthe powers of these techniques. It is important to remember that complex inequalities \nwere always a feature of Keynesian or monopolistic service regimes and that the \ndiscursive egalitarianism that characterised such regimes often tended to contrast \nsharply with their highly unequal material effects \u2018in the ground\u2019  (Graham and \nMarvin, 2001). So we should be careful not to romanticise or over-emphasise the \negalitarian achievements of modern, Keynesian models of service and infrastructure \nprovision.  \n \nNotwithstanding such caveats,  however, it is clear that the proliferation of social and \ngeographical boundaries where discipline and division are at least attempted through \nthe application of software-sorting techniques is a central, and poorly researched, \nfeature of the contemporary social world (Garland, 2001, Jones, 2002). \n \nIII Code Space: Software-Sorted Mobilities \n \nWith these points in mind we can turn to our three reviews of particular software-\nsorted geographies. Our first \u2013 that of software-sorted physical and electronic \nmobility systems --  remains perhaps the least understood and researched. \nConsiderable work has been undertaken exploring the ways in which complex \nassemblages of new technologies facilitate and mediate a whole range of mobilities \n(Urry, 2000). The blurring of new media into car systems (Sheller and Urry, 2000, \nThrift, 2004b), logistics systems (Meyer, 2001), airport systems (Aday, 2004 a,b, \nDodge and Kitcin, 2004), and street spaces (Andrejevic, 2003) has been increasingly \nreported. However, the specific roles of software-sorting systems in shaping social \nand geographical inequalities in physical and electronic mobility systems and spaces  \nremain only poorly understood.  \n \nIt is clear that physical mobility systems increasingly utilise powerful software-sorting \ntechniques to address imperatives of profit maximisation, social control, or perceived \nrisk minimisation. Emerging research by Aday (2004a,b) and Dodge and Kitchen \n(2004), for example, has successfully revealed the ways in which key physical \nmobility spaces such as airports can only sustain the astonishing transactional \ncomplexity now expected of them because they are saturated with, and, indeed, \nconstituted through, complex sets of software-sorting and coding systems. \nImportantly, Dodge and Kitchin (2004a, 198) argue that the relationship between \ncode and electronic and physical mobility systems like airports is qualitatively \ndifferent from the relationship between code and other types of built of technosocial \nenvironment. In mobility systems they write that \"the relationship between code and \nspace is dyadic \u2013 code and space are mutually constituted, wherein how the space \nis produced and used is predominantly mediated by code\" (original emphasis). \nDodge and Kitchin use the term \u2018code\/space\u2019 to describe such environments. This \nthey distinguish from \u2018coded spaces\u2019 like CCTV-surveilled streets, where code \nremains, thus far, more peripheral to the constitution of the built environment (ibid.). \n \n1 Software-Sorted Airline Mobilities \n \nTaking airports as  paradigmatic \u2018code\/spaces\u2019 and sites of ubiquitous tracking, it is \nnow clear that \"the control of international mobilities that cross through airports and \nborder zones  are effectively managed, filtered and screened within these sites\" \n(Aday, 2004a, 1365, original emphasis). This  work demonstrates that, traditionally, \nthe use of machine-readable tags and tickets allowed all human, cargo, baggage \nand worker flows  in and around airport spaces, and, indeed, airline systems, to be \nsurveilled, tracked, and socially controlled with a high degree of precision. As \ncomputerisation of the multiple logistical and transactional systems  involved has \nproceded, so an extending universe of software and code has started to orchestrate \nthe burgeoning flows associated with  the global airline system.  \n \nImportantly, from the point of view of software-sorting and social inequality, Aday \n(2004a) shows that such systems are being augmented by software-sorting systems \nwhere the identifier of a person is actually biometric \u2013 that is, a supposedly unique \nsignifier scanned directly from part of the human body (usually a  finger, face or iris \nscan).  Initially \u2013 as at Schipol airport\u2019s \u2018Privium\u2019 system -- biometrics have been \nused to allow premium, business travellers to bypass conventional border controls. \nAday argues that the practices and framings of biometric approaches to software-\nsorted mobilities are deeply shaped by neoliberal ideologies. In particular, a politics \nof differential speed is established. Biometric techniques are used to \"facilitate  the \nease of speed for trusted, \u2018good\u2019 and economically sound business travellers and yet \nimpede the flow of \u2018bad guys\u2019 or secondary processing \u2013 where officers \u2018really don\u2019t \ncare how long it takes\u2019 to process their entry\".(Aday, 2004, 1370).  \n \nHowever, as biometrics shift from elite to mass usage, the prospects of travellers \nwho can\u2019t display their body signature \u2013 \u2018illegal\u2019 migrants or asylum seekers, for \nexample \u2013 worsen considerably. This is because the identification and tracking  of \nsuch people will become much easier simply because they are subjects who \nattempting to travel around the world\u2019s airline system without their associated \nbiometric tag moving through the parallel coded system.  \n \nCompounding the routine racial profiling or air travellers,  which has deepened \nsignificantly since 9-11, biometric software-sorting techniques necessitate a massive \nglobal extension of interconnected databases, in order to match the deep association \nof bodies, flows and information at transnational scales. The diffusion of such \ntechniques underline the fact that, as Aday concludes, \"the airport is now a \nsurveillance machine\u2014 an assemblage where webs of technology and information \ncombine. Movement, and, increasingly, the body, identity, and objects are made \nlegible, momentarily fusing with technology and virtual realism\" (2004, 1375). \n \n2 Unbundling Highway Spaces and the Quest for \u2018Real-Time\u2019 Road Pricing \n \nHighway and urban transport systems are facing similar transformations (Graham \nand Marvin, 2001). In a detailed case study of the construction of the world\u2019s largest \nprivatised, electronically-charged highway systems \u2013 the CityLink in Melbourne -- for \nexample, David Holmes (2000) has underlined how scarce urban road space can \nbecome a priced commodity allocated to those who can afford it through software-\nsorting techniques. Whilst, like the central London congestion charge, access here is \ncontrolled through a fixed tariff, in some premium highways in California \u2013 for \nexample I-15 highway in San Diego \u2013 software-sorting can actually display variable \npricing in real time (Graham and Marvin, 2001, 253). This is based on algorithms \nwhich estimate exactly the level of price per journey that is likely to deter enough \ndrivers to guarantee free-flowing traffic -- no matter how bad the congestion is on the \nsurrounding public highway system.   \n \nHere we confront software-sorting to guarantee speed, and time saving, to affluent \nelites through a kind of  neoliberal, technoscientific, urban bypass. Such techniques \nherald new urban geographies of differential mobility. In these software-sorting \ntechniques can differentiate between various users based on their willingness, or \nability, to pay for newly commodified road space. If EU proposals for satellite-based \ncharging of all road users, based on assessments of their environmental impact, are \never implemented, similar technbiques could conceivably be used to force drivers to \npay charges based on assessments of the environmental externalities of their \nvehicles. \n \n3 The Internet: From \u2018Best Effort\u2019 to \u2018Squelching the Scavenger Class\u2019 \n \nRemarkably similar techniques are also being mobilised, much more discretely, to \nsort people\u2019s access to a whole suite of electronic mobility, communications, and \nservice systems (Winseck, 2002). The Internet, for example,  was originally \ndeveloped to accord all  the \u2018packets\u2019 of information  that flowed within it equal \nstatus. This was the so-called \u2018best effort\u2019 model of \u2018packet switching\u2019 where equal \nefforts were made to allow all packets to flow to desired destinations at all times. \nNow, however, the entire Internet is being reengineered into a  corporately controlled \nsystem of systems dominated by a vast range of commercial services. As Dwayne \nWinseck notes, the technological architectures of the Internet are thus being \nreconfigured: \n \"by designing networks that put intelligence, resources, and \ncapabilities back in the network[\u2026]. Consequently, open network \narchitectures are yielding to network designs that enhance network \nproviders\u2019 ability to allocate resources, bandwidth, and speed to \nvarying types of information and services. This is based on their \nrelation to the network owner, revenue potential, class of user \nserved, and judgements regarding the quality fo content\" (2002, \n182).  \n \nIn the process, complex software-sorting techniques are now being enrolled, by the \ntransnational media firms who run the Internet, to actually sift and prioritise each of \nthe billions of data packets that flow over the \u2018Net at any one time. Whilst this will \nallow a guaranteed quality of service to premium users and prioritised services, even \nat times of major internet congestion, those packets deemed unprofitable will actually \nbe deliberately \u2018dropped\u2019, leading to a  dramatic deterioration in the electronic \nmobilities of marginalised users (Graham, 2004c).  Such strategies are closely linked \nto the growing corporate control of domestic and mobile internet use, where \u2018home \nportals\u2019 and coded cookies establish an increasingly commodified regime through \nwhich multimedia conglomerates capture personal identities, enrolling them into \ncoded geographies of marketing and exchange, often without  users' knowledge \n(Luke, 2002). \n \nTake, for example, the strategy of the most important manufacturer of Internet \nrouters, Cisco (2002). They have produced a telling document outlining the centrality \nof software-sorting to the new Internet architectures that they are establishing.  \nDescribing how premium internet services can now be offered to what they call the \n\"transactional\/interactive data class\" of users, the document also outlines how the \nelectronic mobilities of what they term the \"scavenger class\" will now be actively \nimpeded based on software-sorting of every single Internet packet. \"The Scavenger \nclass [categorisation]  is intended to provide differential services, or \u2018less-than-Best-\nEffort\"\u2019 services, to certain applications\", the document suggests. \"Applications \nassigned to this class have little or no contribution to the organizational objectives of \nthe enterprize [\u2026]. Assigning a minimal bandwidth queue to Scavenger traffic forces \nit to be squelched to virtually nothing during periods of congestion\" (Cisco, 2002).  \n \nSuch potent \u2018netscapes of power,\u2019  as Winseck (2002) terms them, are completely at \nodds with the widespread surviving perception that the Internet somehow  \nintrinsically embodies deeply egalitarian exchange. \"Far from being transparent \nmeans of channelling information from one point to another,\" writes Winseck, the \nemerging software-sorted Internet  networks \"are technologies of discrimination that \nregulate information flows according to fine-grained criteria set by network owners. In \nessence gatekeeping functions have been hardwired into network architectures as \npart of the communication industries\u2019 strategies to cultivate and control markets\" \n(2002, 1820). \n \nSimilar software-sorting techniques have also been shown to shape the results \nproduced by supposedly unbiased search engines in ways that favour the affiliates of \nthe transnational media conglomerates who own search engine companies (Introna \nand Nissenbaum, 2000). Moreover, as mobile phones emerge as peripatetic \nappliances mediating user\u2019s relationships with geographic and city spaces and \nservices, so they, too, are opening up whole new realms of software-sorting \n(Andrejevic, 2003). Here, such techniques promise to customise \u2018mobile commerce\u2019 \nservices to an individual\u2019s own consumption and mobility habits, targeting advertising \nspam for goods and services that are geographically and geodemeographically \nappropriate, as the user moves around the city. Individually tailored city maps will be \ndirectly customised to software records of users\u2019 consumption habits. Andrejevic  \npoints out that \"time-space paths will be used as a strategy for customisation. \nAdvertising and marketing appeals will be directed to consumers based on where \nthey are in time and space.\" This, he believes, will usher in \"a radical departure from \nthe productive disciplinary surveillance associated with the institution of mass society \n(2003, 134). \n \n4 Call Centres; The Politics of Differential Queuing  \n \nIn our final example of software-sorted electronic mobilities, it is becoming apparent \nthat even call centre telephone queues are now being differentially sorted based on \nvalue judgements about callers\u2019 economic value as customers (Graham, 2004c). \nBecause call centres can detect the telephone numbers of incoming calls, and \ninstantly check these against customer and geodemographic databases, they can \nuse software-sorting techniques to queue \u2018good customers\u2019 for much shorter times \nthan \u2018bad\u2019 customers.  \n \n\"One of your best customers dials the national customer service number for your \ncompany\", gushes the scenario in a marketing brochure from the Avaya Corporation \n(2000). \"The ANI [Automatic Number Identification] database reveals the customer to \nbe among the top 5% of your customers. [Our system] routes the customer at high \npriority. When the agent picks up the call, he hears a whispered announcement that \nthis caller is \u2018Top 5\u2019\" (2000, 3)(sic.). \n \nIV  Code Place: Software-Sorted Cities \n \nA substantial body of research has revealed the importance of geographical \ninformation and geodemographic systems  (GIS\u2019s and GDIS\u2019s) in shaping the \nproduction and consumption of contemporary urban spaces (Goss, 1995, Curry, \n1998, Phillips and Curry, 2002). With their tendency to exaggerate and reify \nhomogeneously constructed \u2018ideal type\u2019 neighbourhoods profiles, and so to ossify \nspatial and social classifications, such techniques have been widely shown to \nunderpin redlining and socially regressive location decision making and service \nplanning (Pickles, 1995).  \n 1 Geographic Information Systems as Urban Surveillant-Simulations \n \nGIS\u2019s and GDIS\u2019s do indeed provide powerful urban software-sorting devices. Here \ncode both surveils the social geographies of cities and provides the means to \nconstruct powerful, and highly biased, simulations and visualisations of those \ngeographies (Graham, 1998). Unlike software-sorting in mobility systems just \ndiscussed -- and those operating public streets, as we shall shortly see--  \ngeodemographic systems do not, yet, offer real-time mediations of cities and urban \nlife.  Rather, they are systems of surveillance and simulation that rely on what \nPhillips and Curry have called a \"phenetic fix.\u2019 Linked to locational referencing, \npostcode data bases, mobile and electronic commerce systems, and geopositioning \nnetworks, this palimpsest of code is increasingly determinate in support self-\nreinforcing spatial categorisations. In the process, \"databases become increasingly \ndeterminate: you become where you live\" (Amin and Thrift, 2002, 45).  \n \nThus the city thus itself becomes a software-based simulation, a fine-grained \ndynamic map of consumption and spending potential, as the large geodemographic \nbureaux  now attempt to capture more and more direct consumption information into \nGIS-based  \u2018data warehouses\u2019  from store credit cards, credit bureaux, direct \nmarketing campaigns, Internet responses and the like (Graham, 1998). Goss (1995) \noutlines how such GIS-based systems become transformed from  partial \nrepresentations and simulations of some putative \u2018reality,\u2019 to effectively operate as \nreality itself,  the basis for  precise locational decision making and profit-driven \ntargeting within large retailers : \n\"the GDIS (Geo-Demograpic Information Systems) is literally \nrepresented as a  construction, a \"built environment\" consistent, of \ncourse, with the architectonic metaphors so pervasive in the discourse \non information technology. This architectonic metaphor effectively \ngives substance to a  language, reifying the binary code that \nrepresents information as an alternate world, literally a data \u2018structure\u2019 \n[...]  The abstract data structure is then anchored to a direct \nrepresentation of reality, which leads to the conceit that the world of \nthe GDIS is itself another reality [...].A representation of the \u2018exteriority\u2019 \nof the world is interiorized on the computer\" (Goss, 1995; 143-4) \n \n2 On-Line GIS, Software-Sorting, and the Remediation of Neighbourhoods \n \nCrucially, however, Roger Burrows and Nick Ellison (2004) have demonstrated that \nthe reach and power of GDISs is now extending to directly shape the consumption of \nneighbourhoods, the processes of individual and collective identity formation, and \nthe dynamics of housing markets and educational systems in extremely powerful \nways. Increasingly, GDIS and GIS-based representations of city spaces are directly \nmediating the consumption of place through software-sorting systems that can be \naccessed directly by consumers. Burrows and Ellison (2004, 326) argue that \"the \ninformatization of neighbourhood consumption that online GIS websites of various \nsorts makes available the informational resources by which strategically inclined \nsocial groups are able to find \u2018their\u2019 place within complex and dynamic urban spaces\" \n(2004, 326).  \n \nAs GISs emerge to dramatically remediate  the consumption of housing, education \nand all manner of geographically specific services and attributes (at least for such \n\u2018strategically inclined\u2019 groups), so the processes of neighbourhood informatization \ntake a crucial new turn. Comprehensive national web sites like upmystreet.com in \nthe UK provide powerful postcode based searching devices through which coded \nalgorithms deliver multidimensional analyses of everything from crime rates, school \nperformance, house prices, environmental quality and hazards, pollution, and access \nto services. Customised maps and aerial photographs can be accessed, and virtual \ncommunities of \u2018like minded\u2019 people living in the neighbourhood can be accessed. In \nthe USA such processes have gone even further. Using web sites like \nhomestore.com, people considering moves can automatically sort through \nmetropolitan social geographies to find neighbourhoods with the social and \ndemographic attributes that most closely \u2018match\u2019 those of heir current location.  \n \nThe current saturation of urban environments with a vast universe of tracking \nsystems means that, very soon, dynamic and real-time geographical simulations of \nurban places will be accessible over the Internet. These attempt to match the social \nand demographic fluctuations of real places over various temporal scales (Burrows \nand Ellison, 2004, 329). Once such \u2018tracking\u2019 \u2013 of people, vehicles, consumption \nhabits, and digital interactions \u2013 becomes routine, software-sorting techniques will \nmove beyond crude, generalised, and \u2018lumpy\u2019 simulations of places accessible over \nPCs to offer real-time and fluctuating  simulations to mobile and hand-held \ncomputers based on the real time-space flux of urban mobilities.  Such systems will \nallow individuals to be \"aggregated with that of other proximate mobile individuals in \norder to construct fleeting geodemographic characterizations of any particular \nconfiguration of people in any particular place\" (Burrows and Ellison, 2004, 329).  \n \nAs a result of such applications it is now clear that the social politics of place, and the \ngeographies on urban inequality, are being directly mediated by the sorting and \nsimulation capabilities of online geodemographic software. The individual and \ncollective preferences, and identities, of subjects are starting to impact upon the \ngeographies of inequality through their active engagement with software-sorting \nsystems. Through such systems \"privileged social actors increasingly affect the \nsocial and political patterning and characteristics \u2013 and social politics \u2013 of their \nchosen neighbourhoods\" (Burrows and Ellison, 2004, 334). Online GISs are being \nused to negotiate the social geography of cities. Such systems: \n \"strategically, substitut[e]  online search capacity for what was hitherto \nintuition [\u2026]. The use of information for ostensibly consumption and \nlifestyle goals will transform the contours of social citizenship. \nEssentially, individuals who are privileged in this way can be expected \nto separate themselves increasingly from a dependence of goods and \nservices produced for collective ends \u2013 and, by extension, from the \nresponsibilities that accompany these forks of collective consumption\"\" \n(330).  \n \nThus, as online GISs support a consumerisation of the consumption and production \nof urban social geographies, the real concern is that such processes will further \nsupport an unbundling of notions of universal urban citizenship that elsewhere, in my \nbook with Simon Marvin, I have termed a process of splintering urbanism (Graham \nand Marvin, 2001). Individualised, online-GIS based decisions and behaviour, based \non self identities and reflective, lifestyle choices, are likely to allow socially powerful \ngroups to further their secession from the wider space-times of the city, as they seek \nto locate in, and consume, the privileged, best serviced and highest amenity \nneighbourhoods. The algorithms that support such choices, simulations,  orderings, \nand classifications \u2013 the very guts of online GIS systems \u2013 meanwhile remain \ncompletely opaque and utterly unscrutinised. Moreover, \"aside from the initial \nprogramming of these systems and the naming of the classifications they use, there \nis little human agency at play in their day-to-day operation\" (Burrows and  Gane, \n2004, 29)  \n \nWhen added to the proliferation of privatised mobility infrastructures and defensive, \ngated, private communities in many cities, the predominant  use of online GISs by \nrelatively affluent, powerful and technologically literate groups seem likely to provide \nnew \u2018secessionary networked spaces\u2019 (Graham and Marvin, 2001). These seem \nlikely to work to further undermine concepts of universalised, redistributive politics \nbased on integrative and public notions of city governance operating to ameliorate \nsocial inequalities across metropolitan scales.  This is particularly so as marginalised \nsubjects and communities in cities often remain largely unable to engage in the \nonline GISs that are so rapidly remediating the production and consumption of urban \nplaces for more affluent. groups \"Lacking the requisite virtual and material resources, \nthese groups are less able to shape forms of social politics capable of protecting, let \nalone extending, the public services and accompanying collectivist ideologies n \nwhich they continue to depend\" (Burrow and Ellison, 204, 335). Such conclusions, \nhowever, must remain speculative because very little research has actually yet been \ndone on the ways in which online GIS systems are influencing the production, \nconsumption and experience of geographies of urban inequality.  \n \nV  Code Face: Software-Sorted Streets \n \nOur final exploration of the extension of software-sorting techniques addresses the \nproliferation of \u2018algorithmic\u2019 closed circuit television systems, covering city streets \nand public places, which attempt to automatically recognise peoples' faces using \ninputted image databases. Building on the massive and rapid diffusion of analogue \nCCTV, which relies on the (expensive) \u2018MK1 eyeball\u2019 of human operators scanning \nmonitors and recording footage using banks of domestic-style video recorders, a \nmajor effort is now being made to install much cheaper, automated, facial-\nrecognition, or \u2018event-driven\u2019 CCTV in the place of such systems (Norris and \nArmstrong, 1999). Often such systems take advantage of the installation of \nbroadband and internet infrastructures with their ready multimedia capabilities. The \n\u2018surveillance surge\u2019 that has followed the 9\/11 attacks, as a vast \u2018security-industrial \ncomplex\u2019 has attempted to sell \u2018silver bullet,\u2019 technologised solutions to the perceived \nfears of \u2018terrorism,\u2019 has added further momentum to the digitisation of CCTV (Zureik, \n2004, Lyon, 2004, Gray, 2003).  \n \n1 The Face as Bar-Code: Face-Recognition CCTV and the Automation of Street \nSurveillance \n \nIn digital, facial recognition CCTV, the software-sorting process involves the inputting \nof the facial, biometric imagery of a \u2018target\u2019 population which computer algorithms \nthen actively seek out.  Crucially, this inputting tends to go on without the subject\u2019s \nconsent: \"unlike other biometrics [facial recognition CCTV] can operate anonymously \nin the background\" (Koskela, 2003, 2). The code within the facial recognition system \nbecomes a key political site because its operation automatically stipulate the \nsubjects, locations or behaviours that are deemed by the operators to be \u2018abnormal\u2019, \n\u2018threatening\u2019 and worthy of further scrutiny or tracking.  \n \nAs well as stipulating the digitised signatures of \u2018target\u2019 faces, software-based CCTV \ncan also be programmed to search for  the signature walking styles that are deemed \nto be most often used by those committing criminal acts, for the number plates of \nsuspect cars, even, when linked with microphones or smelling sensors,  for stipulate \nsuspect sounds or smells  (Hook, 2001). One report on the growth of such \nautomated, \u2018intelligent\u2019, detection systems, from a leading CCTV industry \nrepresentative, explains the process through which software is designed to \u2018target\u2019 \napparently abnormal behaviours, presences, and people, bluntly. \"Recognising \naberrant behaviour\", it writes, \"is for a scientist a matter of grouping expected \nbehaviour and writing an algorithm that recognises any deviation from the \u2018normal\u2019\" \n(Hook, 2001, 20).  \n \nThe social politics of software sorting is rarely described so succinctly. The report \ncontinues to describe how pattern -recognition and neural software could be \nembedded within facial recognition CCTV to support a much wider automatic search \nfor the supposed signifiers of social pathology. \"If the sensors were to \u2018see\u2019 a leg \nmoving back and forward but the torso remaining still,\" it continues, \"that might \nsuggest that someone was kicking something rather than just walking along. Equally, \na milling crowd where none was expected or rapid movements of an arm might also \ntrigger an alarm in the system\" (Hook, 2001, 20). \n \nThe fact that coded algorithms can automatically monitor vastly larger domains of \ntime and space and vastly larger CCTV camera networks than human operators \nadds to the sense that it represents a step-change in the power of CCTV (Graham \nand Wood, 2003). There are very real risks that the multiple \u2018islands\u2019 of private and \npublic CCTV systems, each monitored by its own human operators, could quickly \nmerge into much more massive and geographically-stretched facial recognition \nCCTV systems. Potentially, these could operate to exploit transnational divisions of \nlabour, with operators, and their software-sorting systems, on the other side of the \nworld from the CCTV \u2018eyes\u2019 themselves . Software sorting techniques provide scope \nto realise the clear economies of scale and scope that the obvious limits of human \noperation have, thus far, made impossible (Graham, 2002). \n \nThe proliferation of such systems raises a host of crucial political, social and ethical \nquestions. The possible connections between facial recognition CCTV and the \ngeographies of inequality are particularly worrying.  What happens, asks Phil Agre \n(2003), when a person\u2019s face becomes a sort of \u2018bar-code\u2019 that is captured without \ntheir permission, and integrated into vast data bases allowing extending and \ninterconnecting facial-recognition systems, potential, to track their movements \ncontinuously? \"As the technology advances\", writes Mitchell Gray (2003, 216), the \nclear risk is that \"the software will effortlessly track individuals moving through urban \nspace, public and private. Any appearance of a person deemed threatening can be \nset to trigger an alarm, assuming that that person\u2019s face has been recorded in a \nlinked database\".  \n \nHowever, such fears must be balanced by the  real problems involved in making \nface-recognition CCTV work on city streets even at a very local scale. Most trials of \nfacial recognition CCTV have tended to operate within the narrow obligatory passage \npoints of airport security checks and access control systems. Translating such \nsystems to the open and extremely porous  domains of city street systems, with \npeople\u2019s facial images complicated by multiple angles, weather conditions, levels of \nlight and appearances,  is a major headache for digital CCTV operators. Early \nevidence from one of the first facial recognition CCTV systems in the world, the \n\u2018Facit\u2019 system at Newham in East London, certainly suggests that early generations \nof the technology, at least, rarely identify stipulated individuals effectively in open \nstreet situations (Meek, 2002). However, since this system was installed, major \ntechnological progress has ensured, although, as of 2003 \"the ability to match a  \nface in a crows [was] still elusive\" (Norris, 2003, 271). \n \n2  \u201cA Biology of Culpability\u201d : Embedding Prejudice into Code?  \n \nImportantly, the potential for effective recognition also varies heavily between \ndifferent social or ethnic groups. An analysis by Lucas Introna of one trial of various \nfacial recognition CCTV systems concludes, for example, that \"for the top systems \n[\u2026] identification rates for males were 6% to 9% points higher than for females[\u2026]. \nRecognition rates for older people were higher than for younger people\" (2003, 20). \nMoreover, Introna quotes the official document which confirms that \"Asians are \neasier [to recognise] than whites, African-Americans are easier than whites, [and] \nother race members are easier than whites\" (FRVT, 2002, 8)(sic.). Incorporated in to \ncomplex, ongoing software-sorting CCTV systems, the potential for such \ndiscrepancies to be translated into major geographical and social inequalities is \nclearly immense. \n \nThree prime concerns arise here. First, there is the question of the invisibility of \noperation and design of such systems. Introna and Wood (2004) argue that the \napparently mundane design decisions that go into facial recognition CCTV systems, \nand the code embedded in them, need to be opened up to scrutiny. They argue  that \nthe 'silent\u2019, passive and utterly invisible code within face recognition CCTV systems -\n- where even the location of the software-sorting process may be far from the gaze \nof the cameras \u2013 must be made visible if the configurations  and implications of such \nsoftware-sorting processes are to be exposed. This is a prerequisite, they argue, if \nany hope can be sustained that such systems can be brought under any form of \ndemocratic scrutiny and regulation (Introna and Wood, 2004, 195). The great fear, \nIntrona and Wood argue, is that the racial, social or gender biases reported amongst \noperators of manual CCTV systems (see Norris and Armstrong, 1999), may be \ndirectly translated  into the  very facial recognition algorithms that are the basis for \nthe software sorting process. \n \nSecond, Mitchell Gray (2003) argues that facial recognition CCTV systems \ndecontextualise the behaviour of human subjects from their observation or detection. \nThey remove the contingency of discretion and local knowledge that once \ncharacterised the way human law enforcement personnel decided whether to use \nsanctions of force (Koskela, 2003, Norris, 2003). And they threaten to open the door \nto a widening universe of algorithmically policed systems which detect the supposed  \nbiometric or digital signifiers of social or individual pathology at a more or less \nconsiderable distance, as defined by a  highly dubious set of \u2018scientific\u2019 sub-\ndisciplines who have much to gain from the ubiquitous application of these \ntechnologies. Nikolas Rose (2000), referring to the emerging biocriminology which \nlinks code, surveillance, and genetic or biometric detection, calls  this an emerging \n\"biology of culpability.\"  Here Gray (2003, 325) notes that micro-expression detectors \nare already being developed within the US military to detect \u2018unusual expressions\u2019 \nnot supposedly associated with their location of behaviour.  \n \nFinally, there are grave dangers that algorithmically controlled CCTV systems might \nwork to deepen already establish ecologies of normalization, and demonization, \nwithin neoliberal urban landscapes of power. Exaggerating logics of exclusion \nagainst \u2018failed consumers,\u2019 the young, refugees\/asylum seekers, or other demonised \nminorities, within the increasingly polarised landscapes of contemporary cities, these \nvery logics could, conceivably, be embedded in biases within the very code that \nmakes facial recognition CCTV systems work (see Reeve, 1996).  Indeed, it is \nconceivable that such biometric and individualised systems could destroy the \nanonymised interactions that have long been central characteristics of city spaces. A \nnew ontology of the body could be ushered in which uses software-sorting \ntechniques to continuously police and stipulate notions of the purported value, \nfitness, riskiness, worth and legality of subjects, based on the continuous scanning of \na whole suite of biometric signatures, as people move  within and between city \nspaces (Van der Ploeg, 1999).  \n To Phil Agre (2001), such a shift would could usher in a \"tremendous change in our \nsociety\u2019s conception of the human person. People would find strangers addressing \nthem by name\" in previously anonymised encounters in city streets and commercial \nspaces. More worrying still, normalised, commercial judgements, based on \ncontinuous connections to credit registers and the like, could cement the processes \nof consumer marginalisation to this new logic of personalised monitoring and (Agre, \n2001, 3).  \n \nVI  Conclusions: Towards a Spatial Politics of Code \n \nThis paper has sought to underline the centrality of software-sorting in structuring \ncontemporary social and geographical inequalities. It has also attempted to illustrate \nthe need to maintain a broad, multisectoral perspective which can capture how \ndifferent software-sorting techniques are encroaching across different dimensions of \ncontemporary societies. Given the  limited space available here, I would like to finish \nby  briefly underlining four central questions raised by this discussion. \n \nFirst, it is very clear from this discussion that software-sorting must be at the centre \nof any attempt to conceptualise the formation, maintenance  and experience of  \nsocial and geographical inequalities within contemporary capitalist societies. A \npressing imperative for human geography, in particular, is to fully address, and \nexcavate,  the power of code and software-sorting techniques in continually \norchestrating the geographies of  contemporary inequality.  Software-sorting \ntechniques are diffusing rapidly to mediate the production, consumption ad \nexperience of physical and electronic mobility systems and spaces, urban \nneighbourhoods, a whole plethora of service, finance, and communication systems, \nand even city streets. So powerful and invisible have such domains of technosocial \npower become that geographers and other social scientists addressing social \ninequality will surely face nothing short of a paradigm crisis of irrelevance if they do \nnot address  them with much more sophistication, energy and urgency than they \nhave done hitherto. As Amin and Thrift suggest, software-sorting techniques \"are \nbecoming one of the chief ways of animating the city. They must not be allowed to \ntake us unaware\" (Amin and Thrift, 2002, 128).  \n \nIt is therefore time for a concerted, multidisciplinary effort to try and open up the \n\u2018black boxes\u2019 that trap software-sorting, and the cultural and spatial politics of code, \nwithin their esoteric, largely unknown, and almost completely opaque, technocratic \nworlds (Eischen, 2003). For, crucially, software-sorting practices \"must become \ntransparent if we are to evaluate critically the politics of mobility,\" as well as those of \ninequality, citizenship, the city, and the body, more generally (Aday, 2004a, 1377). \n \nThis paper has begun to demonstrate how, through the application of  software-\nsorting techniques, whole swathes of the urban public realm and  the essential \nprivate and pubic services of advanced industrial nations are being \u2018mass \ncustomised\u2019, unbundled, commodified, individualised, and co-ordinated through \nnetworked technologies linking scales from the globe to the body. This is being \naccomplished based on  combinations of neoliberal, consumeristic principles of \ngovernance, new technological assemblages, and intensifying surveillance \ncapabilities. In post Keynesian, neoliberal contexts, it is clear that software-sorting \ntechniques provide critical political sites. This is especially so as, currently,  they are \nbeing overwhelmingly implemented to address perceived  imperatives amongst \nservice providers of offering favoured groups and places enhanced services, rights \nand mobilities, whilst directly working to undermine the prospects of marginalised \ngroups and communities. \n \nSecond, whilst the vague contours of software-sorted geographies outlined here are, \nindeed, now starting to become apparent, a whole range of  vitally important \nresearch questions remain virtually unaddressed. In what ways,  for example, do the \ninequalities that are constantly and automatically produced through software-sorting \nmap on to the more familiar geographies and spatialities of inequality within and \nbetween contemporary cities? How do multiple systems of software-sorting interact \nand combine together? Do their redistributive effects multiply through positive \nfeedback loops to favour  and disfavour broadly the same individuals, groups and \nplaces? Do such compound effects reinforce broader trends that have been \nidentified towards the \u2018splintering\u2019 of the sociotechnical and geographical fabric of \ncontemporary cities (Graham and Marvin, 2001). If so, might this herald the onset, as \nLieven de Cauter (2004) has termed it, of a sort of \"capsular civilisation\" dominated \nby the cultures and biopolitics of (attempted) separation, a vast infrastructure of \ncontinuous, digital filtering, and the cultural politics of fear? Or do these effects work \nin more complex and contraditory ways, as they interact with the more subtly biased \npractices that, I would argue,  have tended to mark the service cultures of Keynesian \nand electromechanical  service regimes?  \n \nA second group of key research questions surround the subjectivities of service use \nand mobility within software-sorted domains. How, for example, do such techniques \ninfluence the identities, experiences, emotions and perceptions of those on the \nreceiving end of software sorting? Does the varying level of (in)visibility amongst \nsuch techniques -- for example between relatively invisible electronic mobility \nsystems and relatively visible city street and physical transport systems -- affect such \nsubjectivities and experiences?  \n \nA final group of research questions emerge when we consider the linkages between  \nthe widespread implementation of software-sorting systems and the extending \nspatial divisions of labour and mobility within neoliberal capitalism more broadly. \nWhat, for example, are the geographies of production, diffusion and operation of the \nvast universe of software-sorting systems now being implemented? How are they \nenmeshed within broader transnational divisions of labour within information and \ndata processing industries and how are their \u2018front\u2019 and \u2018back-office\u2019 elements, linking \nthe points of data capture to the moments of algorithmic judgement,  geographically \nstructured? Finally how do the social and normative judgements, and inclusions, that \nform the heart of these systems  diffuse between different geographical, social and \nsectoral sites and contexts?  \n \nOur third  critical conclusion concerns the practicalities and epistemologies of social \nresearch on software-sorting. How, for example, can social and geographical \nresearch aimed at excavating the social  and spatial politics of code, and the impacts \nof software-sorting techniques on the production and experience of inequality,  best \nprogress? Given the opaque, fast-moving and deeply arcane nature of this crucial \nnew realm of produced inequalities, how can social and geographical research hope \nto genuinely address this challenge? Given the inevitably confidential, proprietary \nand highly technical nature of the core algorithms that now socially-sort so many key \nsocial domains, what research techniques and paradigms can offer any genuine \nassistance here? Clearly, the research challenges here are truly immense. This is \nespecially so given that, from the point of view of social geographic research, the \nworlds of software-sorting tend not to be amenable in any meaningful way to \ntraditional geographical or social scientific research techniques and \nconceptualisations (Thrift and French, 2002). \n \nThis paper\u2019s final conclusion raises the question of appropriate political responses to \nthe spatial politics of software-sorting. How can regulation, policy and resistance \naddress the rapid and multi-scaled diffusion of automated software-sorting \ntechniques across contemporary societies? When such techniques tend to rely on \ntheir true opacity and topological configuration to elude any real attempts at public \nregulation from polities which are necessarily jurisdictionally-embedded, how can \nstates and policy makers begin to respond? In what ways can policy makers, in the \ndiverse reams now affected, truly gain knowledge of, and leverage over, the \nsoftware-sorting techniques that are embedded at the heart of the emerging \ninequalities?  What policy instruments might best address these fast-moving \ndomains, bringing standards, transparency, and democratic oversight where at \npresent there exists a universe of unfettered, \u2018frontier\u2019 technoscience? Can such \npolicy makers avoid the ever-deepening encroachment of software-sorted \ntechniques, and the resulting emergence of societies where a universe of electronic \ncode continually works to imprint neoliberal and consumerist logics-- with virtual \ninvisibility -- on to a growing proportion of social and economic exchanges? And \nwhat scope is there for creative resistance through which social movements, \nactivists, and participatory technological spaces, can work to infiltrate and expose \nthe inequities that are being digitally encoded into such routine, but essential, \ntransactions?  \n \nIn addressing this wide research, policy and activist agenda, the challenge is to \nmaintain a critical and informed position without falling foul of dystopian and \nabsolutist scenarios suggesting that software-sorting techniques are somehow \nlimitless and all-powerful. As Koskella (2003) suggests, \"urban space will always \nremain less knowable and, thus, less controllable than the restricted panoptic \nspace\". Spaces which escape the reach of software-sorting systems do and will  \nremain. A politics of transgressing, resisting, and even dismantling software sorting \nsystems is possible. And, crucially, as Ash Amin and Nigel Thrift put it, the: \n \"networks of control that snake their way through cities are necessarily \noligoptic, not panoptic: they do not fit together. They will produce \nvarious spaces and times, but they cannot fill out the whole space of the \ncity \u2013 in part because they cannot reach everywhere, in part because \nthey therefore cannot know all spaces and times, and in part because \nmany new spaces and times remain to be invented\" (2002, 128). \n \nReferences \n \nAday, 2004a: Surveillance at the airport: Surveilling mobility\/mobilising surveillance, \nEnvironment and Planning A, 26, 1365-1380. \nAday, P. 2004b: Secured and sorted mobilities: Examples from the airport, \nSurveillance and Society, 1, 500-519. \nAgre, P. 2001: Your face is not a bar code: Arguments against automatic face \nrecognition in public places, Whole Earth, 106, 74-77. \nAmin, A. and Thrift, N. 2002, Cities: Reimagining the urban, Cambridge :Polity. \nAndrejevic, M. 2003: Monitored mobility in the era of mass customization, Space and \nCulture, 6, 132-150. \nAvaya Corporation 2000: Avaya CRM solutions: Individual service management, \nWashington DC:  Avaya Inc. \nBloomfield, B. 2001: In the right place at the right time: Electronic tagging and the \nproblems of social order\/disorder, Sociological Review, 49, 174-218. \nBolter, J. and Grusin, R.  2000: Remediation : Understanding new media, Cambridge \nMa. : MIT Press. \nBowker, G. and Leigh-Star,  S. 1999: Sorting things out,  Cambridge, Ma. : MIT \nPress. \nBrenner, N. 2004: New state spaces: urban governance and the rescaling of \nstatehood, Oxford University Press: Oxford. \nBurrows, R. and  Gane,  N. 2004: Geodemographics, software and class.
