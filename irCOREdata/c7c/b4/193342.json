Talat Nasim, H. M. Chowdhury and I. C. Eperon*\nDepartment of Biochemistry, University of Leicester, University Road, Leicester LE1 7RH, UK\nReceived June 10, 2002; Revised and Accepted August 13, 2002\nABSTRACT\nCurrent methods for measuring the ef\u00aeciency of\nsplicing in mammalian cells rely on either direct\nanalysis of the RNA, which does not lend itself to\nrapid assays, or on single reporter functions that\nare subject to numerous intrinsic variables. If two\nprotein activities are encoded within a single\nreading frame but on separate exons, with an inter-\nvening sequence containing termination codons,\nthen the expression of the second activity is\ndependent on removal of the intervening sequence\nby pre-mRNA splicing. Thus, the ratio of the activ-\nities encoded by exon 2 to exon 1 re\u00afects the ratio\nof expression from spliced mRNA to the total\nexpression of spliced and unspliced RNA. This pro-\nvides a rapid and convenient assay for the effects\non splicing ef\u00aeciency of trans-acting factors or of\nalterations in the sequences of the intron and\nsurrounding exon sequences.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe splicing of mammalian pre-mRNA is complex in terms of\nboth the signals that affect it and the number of factors\ninvolved in the reactions. Apart from the consensus sequences\naround the splice junctions, sequences at relatively distant\nsites within the exons and the introns are important in\ndetermining not just the ef\u00aeciency of the reactions but also the\nsites of splicing. Understanding the roles of these sequences is\nimportant because the consensus sequences do not suf\u00aece to\nspecify the correct sites; there are many additional sites that\nappear to satisfy the basic requirements and yet are not used.\nIn addition, approximately one-half of all human genes\nencoding proteins appear to produce several isoforms of\nmRNA and protein by alternative splicing, often in a regulated\nway, but very few of the sequences that control the availability\nand level of use of the alternative sites have been identi\u00aeed\nyet.\nThe identi\u00aecation of factors that affect mammalian splicing\nis generally done by transfection of fragments of a gene into\nmammalian cells, followed by analysis of sequences included\nin the mRNA expressed. However, it is not usual for the\nef\u00aeciency of splicing of an intron to be measured directly. In\nmost cases, the assay is based upon the examination of mature\nmRNA and addresses the mechanisms by which one site is\nselected rather than another. Thus, for example, preferences\namong candidate 5\u00a2 splice sites or 3\u00a2 splice sites are tested by\nthe use of competing alternative sites (1\u00b15) and the sequences\nthat affect the use of an exon are tested by measuring the levels\nof mRNA in which the exon is included or excluded (skipped).\nThis method has the advantage that many of the other factors\nthat might affect expression, such as variations in transfection\nef\u00aeciency or transcription, are eliminated, while differences in\nstability of the various forms of mRNA cannot be ignored (2)\nbut can be assumed to be less than might be expected between\nspliced and unspliced RNA. There are two major disadvan-\ntages to such strategies: there is no information bearing\ndirectly on the ef\u00aeciency of splicing, and the direct analysis of\nmRNA by RT\u00b1PCR, RNase protection or northern blotting is\nrelatively laborious and does not lend itself to high throughput\nanalyses. Reporter assays have been used in several cases, but\nthese have been single reporter functions (6,7), in which\nactivity depends on splicing to remove an intron or incorporate\nan exon, and they are susceptible to variation between samples\nin the levels of transfection, transcription, etc.\nInferences drawn on the basis of competition between\nalternative splicing pathways can be misleading. For example,\nthe numerous studies using RT\u00b1PCR to analyse incorporation\nor skipping of an exon after mutagenesis of local sequences\nare very readily interpreted in terms of exon de\u00aenition, a\nwidespread and important phenomenon that is of considerable\nvalue in understanding splice site usage, but they may not\nreveal cases in which one of the \u00afanking introns has been\nspliced, simply because partially spliced RNA is less likely to\nbe detected proportionately.\nThe most common alternative strategy for identi\u00aecation of\nfactors that affect splicing ef\u00aeciency is by the analysis of\nsplicing in vitro, in a nuclear extract. This is a powerful and\nimportant method that has been used widely. However, it has\nseveral limitations: it requires the use of relatively short\ntranscripts that usually lack the complexity and length of the\nnatural pre-mRNA, and thus may not identify the rate-limiting\nsteps for expression in vivo; it is dif\u00aecult to test a wide range of\nprotein factors because of the labour required to prepare these\nproteins (many of which, in the case of splicing factors, are not\nreadily prepared in soluble or native form); and there are very\nfew examples of active splicing extracts that have been made\nfrom differentiated cells, i.e. it is not a useful route in most\n*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

This is\ngenerally done by direct analysis of the mRNA and unspliced\nRNA, often by primer extension without ampli\u00aecation. A\nmore rapid screen is possible with a reporter assay, again\nbased on successful expression of a protein after splicing. A\nparticularly good example is CUP1, in which activity can be\nmeasured as the copper resistance of growth and correlates\nvery well with splicing ef\u00aeciency (3). Many of the variables\nthat affect transient expression assays in mammals are\neliminated because stable and well-characterised clones are\nused.\nTo develop a simple and reliable assay for splicing\nef\u00aeciency, rather than competition, in mammals, a reporter\nactivity that depends on splicing should be linked to a second\nactivity that corrects for variations in either transfection\nef\u00aeciency or any other steps in transcription and processing.\nIdeally, the second activity would report the level of unspliced\nRNA. For this purpose, we have devised a reporter construct in\nwhich splicing produces one signal (luciferase activity) but\nboth unspliced and spliced RNA produce b-galactosidase\nactivity. Thus, the ratio of the two activities can be used as a\nrapid screen to detect mutations or trans-acting factors that\nmight affect the ef\u00aeciency of pre-mRNA splicing.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nPlasmid construction\nThe bifunctional reporter plasmid was based upon pBLUGA\n(8), which contains reading frames for b-galactosidase and\nluciferase, separated by a termination codon (to assay\nselenocysteine incorporation) in between SalI and BamHI\nsites. An exon\u00b1intron\u00b1exon unit was cloned into these sites. In\nthe case of plasmid pTN23, the exon and intron comprised\nnucleotides 6084\u00b16237 and 7026\u00b17095 of Ad2, with a novel\n5\u00a2 splice site at 6171\/72 (9), which were joined to nucleotides\n\u00b15 to +76 of exon 6 of the skeletal muscle-speci\u00aec mRNA\nisoform of human as-tropomyosin gene TPM3. Plasmid\npTN24 contained an additional 25 nt from the tropomyosin\nintron, i.e. nucleotides \u00b130 to +76 of TPM3 exon 6. Exonic\n(Ex mut) and intronic (In mut) mutations were obtained by\nsite-directed mutagenesis where the (GGA)3 repeat and the\nnucleotides \u00b19 to \u00b126 of exon 6 were randomly replaced. For\nin vitro splicing assays, the same Ad2\/TPM3 sequences were\ntranscribed, but the adenovirus sequence began at nucleotide\n6023 and included a natural 5\u00a2 splice site at 6079\/80 (TN23ww\nand TN24ww). Complete reading frames for human Tra2b\n(Ayres et al., manuscript in preparation), Tra2a, hnRNPG-T\nand RBMY (Nasim et al., data not shown) were cloned in\npEGFP-C1 and pECFP-N1 (Clontech) in frame with the\n\u00afuorescent protein. Human hnRNPG was cloned in pCG10\nvector (10).\nGene transfer, cell culture and enzymatic assay\nHEK-293 (human embryonic kidney) cells were transiently\ntransfected with relevant plasmids using Gene Jammer\n(Stratagene). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection\n(11), and b-galactosidase and luciferase activities were\nmeasured using Dual Light\u00e2 System (Biosystems).\nReverse transcription\u00b1polymerase chain reaction\n(RT\u00b1PCR)\nTotal RNA was isolated using TRIreagent (Helena\nBiosciences). Any contaminating DNA was removed by\ntreatment with restriction endonuclease and DNase, extraction\nwith solvent and ethanol precipitation. After reverse transcrip-\ntion, PCR was done with Extensor Ready mix 1 (ABgene) and\nprimers directed to the b-galactosidase and luciferase\nsequences for 18, 22 and 26 cycles. One of the primers was\nlabelled with [g-32P]ATP, so for analysis the products were run\nonto a denaturing gel and quanti\u00aeed with a PhosphorImager.\nFigure 1. The test system (A) for in vivo splicing based on the reporter\ngenes encoding b-galactosidase and luciferase, which are fused in frame via\na recombinant fragment of adenovirus and human as-tropomyosin genes.\nThe recombinant fragment contains three in-frame translation stop signals\n(XXX) in the intronic region. Upon transfection of the respective plasmids\ninto the HEK-293 cell line, the DNA would be transcribed under the control\nof SV40 promoter. Two different types of mRNAs would be produced.\nIn the event of inef\u00aecient splicing the RNA produced would contain\npre-mature termination codons. In case of ef\u00aecient splicing, the translation\nstop signals would be removed which would lead to the production of a\nrecombinant gal\u00b1luc fusion protein. The western blot (B) indicates the\npresence of gal\u00b1luc fusion protein, which was detected by anti luciferase\nHRP conjugate antibody. The gal\u00b1luc fusion protein is absent in the\nmock-transfected control extracts.\ne109 Nucleic Acids Research, 2002, Vol. 30 No. 20 PAGE 2 OF 6\n at Leicester U\nniversity Library on M\narch 20, 2015\nhttp:\/\/nar.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nPAGE 3 OF 6 Nucleic Acids Research, 2002, Vol. 30 No. 20 e109\n at Leicester U\nniversity Library on M\narch 20, 2015\nhttp:\/\/nar.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nRNA processing assay in cell free system\nConventional in vitro transcription and splicing reactions were\ncarried out (12) and the splicing products were analysed on a\npolyacrylamide gel.\nRESULTS\nThe general principle of the method we have adopted is shown\nin Figure 1. The reporter system used in this work is based on\nthe genes encoding b-galactosidase and luciferase, which are\nhighly sensitive and linear across several orders of magnitude.\nWe have constructed a set of reporter constructs where these\ntwo reporter genes were fused with a recombinant fragment\ncontaining two exons and a single intron (Fig. 1A). Upon\ntransfection of these reporter plasmids into a mammalian cell\nline, transcription from the SV40 promoter would produce a\npre-mRNA, which contains three translation stop signals in the\nintron. This pre-mRNA could be processed in either of two\nways. If it is not spliced, the mRNA would contain multiple\ntranslation stop signals in the intron. Translation termination\nwould result in the production of the b-galactosidase protein\nalone. In the event of splicing, the internal stop signals would\nbe removed and a b-galactosidase\u00b1luciferase fusion protein\nwould result. Since the luciferase activity would be produced\nonly after splicing, whereas b-galactosidase would be\nexpressed by spliced and unspliced mRNA, the ratio of\nb-galactosidase and luciferase activities should indicate the\nproportion of cytoplasmic mRNA that is spliced. Complete\nsplicing would give the highest ratio of luciferase to\nb-galactosidase. It might be expected that spliced and\nunspliced RNA would be polyadenylated, exported and\ndegraded with different ef\u00aeciencies, but the same limitation\napplies to the analysis of splicing by any other method.\nTo test whether the assay worked, HEK-293 cells were\ntransfected with a plasmid (pTN23) that contained an\nadenovirus 2 sequence as the 5\u00a2 exon and intron, and an\nalternatively spliced exon from tropomyosin as the 3\u00a2 exon. A\nsecond plasmid was identical but for the inclusion of 30 nt\nfrom the intron preceding the exon in tropomyosin (pTN24).\nThe cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Analysis by\nwestern blotting of cells transfected by pTN23 showed that a\nprotein of a size appropriate for the fusion protein had been\nmade (Fig. 1B). Measurement of the b-galactosidase and\nluciferase activities showed that the luc\/gal ratio in cells\ntransfected with pTN23 plasmid was signi\u00aecantly higher than\nthat from cells transfected with pTN24 (Fig. 2A; all values are\nmeans from 6 to 12 independent transfections). Mutations in\nthe exon and intron sequences resulted in signi\u00aecant changes\nin the luc\/gal ratio, suggesting that there had been effects on\nthe splicing ef\u00aeciency.\nThe sensitivity of the assay to trans-acting modulators of\nsplicing ef\u00aeciency was assayed by co-transfection with\nplasmids encoding Tra2a, Tra2b, hnRNP G, hnRNP G-T\nand RBMY. These produced marked changes in the luc\/gal\nratio. We have also transfected the plasmids pTN23 and\npTN24 in C2C12 (mouse myoblast cell line, ATCC number\nCRL-1772) and NT2 precursor (human teratocarcinoma cell\nline, Stratagene) cell lines. The results were similar to those\nobtained in HEK-293 cells (data not shown).\nTo con\u00aerm that the luc\/gal ratio was correlated with the\nproportion of spliced mRNA, the experiments were repeated\nand the RNA analysed by RT\u00b1PCR (Fig. 2B). The bands\ncorresponding to spliced and unspliced RNA were quanti\u00aeed\nto measure the apparent proportion of spliced RNA (Fig. 2C).\nStrikingly, the results from analysis by RT\u00b1PCR agreed well\nwith the results obtained using the reporter activities (Fig. 2D).\nThere were parallel changes in the apparent level of splicing\nby both assays when the substrate was mutated or potential\nmodulating factors were co-transfected. Thus, the absence of\nsome or all of the 30 nt portion of tropomyosin intron in\npTN23 and In mut enhanced the proportion of spliced mRNA,\nwhereas an exon mutation reduced it considerably. Similarly,\nthe two Tra2 proteins seemed to stimulate splicing, and the\nhnRNP G family proteins to reduce it, hnRNP G being most\neffective. We conclude that the conventional assay of mRNA\nsplicing by RT\u00b1PCR validates the reporter assay and that the\neffects of mutation and trans-acting factors on the proportion\nof spliced mRNA can be ranked in effectiveness by this assay.\nTo con\u00aerm that the changes in the proportion of spliced\nRNA inferred from the RT\u00b1PCR and reporter assays were\nproduced by changes in splicing ef\u00aeciency, transcripts con-\ntaining the adenovirus and tropomyosin portions of pTN23\nand pTN24 were tested in standard in vitro splicing reactions.\nThe transcripts contained an additional 60 nt of adenovirus\nsequence at the 5\u00a2 end, which included an alternative 5\u00a2 splice\nsite. As with the results from both in vivo assays, it can be seen\nin Figure 3 that the tropomyosin intron sequence in TN24\ninhibited splicing very substantially, particularly the second\nstep. Compared with TN23, there was almost no mRNA, and\nthe intermediates accumulated slightly.\nDISCUSSION\nThe disadvantages of conventional methods for assaying\nsplicing ef\u00aeciency in mammalian systems prompted us to\ndevelop a method based on the use of an indirect reporter\nsystem that bypassed a number of the variables that affect\nsingle reporter assays. This system comprises two signals,\nderived from the translation of both spliced and unspliced\nRNA in mammalian cells. Upon splicing the internal trans-\nlation stop signals are removed, which leads to the production\nof a b-galactosidase\u00b1luciferase (gal\u00b1luc) fusion protein\n(Fig. 1B). Without splicing, expression of b-galatosidase\noccurs but translation termination in the intron prevents the\nproduction of luciferase.\nFigure 2. (Previous page) Analyses of the reporter system to determine splicing ef\u00aeciencies in vivo. The reporter constructs along with plasmids encoding trans-\nacting factors were transiently transfected into HEK-293 cells and the activities of the b-galactosidase and luciferase proteins were measured and expressed as\nratios, normalised to a value of 100 with TN 24 (A). The standard deviations of the normalised ratios are indicated by error bars. The total RNA from (A) was\nisolated and analysed by RT\u00b1PCR (B) where two DNA bands derived from spliced and unspliced RNA. Lanes 1\u00b19 are the same samples as in (A) and (C), in\nthe same order. Lane 10 is same as lane 1 except that there was no reverse transcriptase used. Lane 11 derived from mock-transfected control extracts. The\npercentages of spliced RNA were quanti\u00aeed (C) and the correlation (D) between the level of splicing measured by RT\u00b1PCR and luc\/gal ratio was determined.\ne109 Nucleic Acids Research, 2002, Vol. 30 No. 20 PAGE 4 OF 6\n at Leicester U\nniversity Library on M\narch 20, 2015\nhttp:\/\/nar.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nWe have tested the dual-reporter assay in several ways to\nshow that it re\u00afects the ef\u00aeciency of splicing. The highest ratio\nof luciferase\/galactosidase activity was observed when the\nintron was removed (data not shown), and luciferase activity\nwas completely abolished when the 5\u00a2 splice site was mutated\n(data not shown). Using conditions or mutations that are\nknown to affect the ef\u00aeciency of splicing, we found that there\nis a good correlation between the level of splicing determined\nby RT\u00b1PCR and the luciferase\/galactosidase ratio (Fig. 2D).\nThere are several respects in which it was surprising that\nsuch a straightforward assay worked well. The \u00aerst is that\nunspliced RNA tends to be retained in the nucleus (13). This is\na dif\u00aeculty that affects any attempt to measure the ef\u00aeciency\nof splicing based on measurements of pre-mRNA levels,\nbecause the stability of retained RNA is likely to be different\nfrom that of exported RNA. One solution, although it does not\nlend itself to high throughput-type assays, is to measure the\nlevel of pre-mRNA for one intron compared with that of\nanother intron in the same gene (14). However, previous\ninvestigations (13) and our own results indicate that some\nunspliced pre-mRNA is exported and translated, and our\nresults suggest that the fraction of unspliced RNA exported\nmight not change with changes in the ef\u00aeciency of splicing. It\nis likely that some trans-acting factors or cis-elements being\nassayed might affect export, and this should be considered\nwhen interpreting any apparent increases in splicing\nef\u00aeciency.\nAnother potential complication envisaged was that the\npresence of translation termination codons in the pre-mRNA\nmight compromise it. However, nonsense mediated decay\n(NMD) requires splicing (15); in the reporter assay we\ndescribe, the spliced mRNA has no premature termination\ncodons, whereas the mRNA that does contain premature\ntermination codons is, by de\u00aenition, unspliced. There was no\nevidence of NMD from experiments (8,11) that investigated\nselenocysteine incorporation.\nApart from an increase in the proportion of spliced RNA or\na decrease in pre-mRNA export, there are other routes by\nwhich the luciferase\/galactosidase ratio might be increased\nwhich need to be borne in mind when appraising the results.\nFor example, the ratio observed for pTN23 was increased\ndramatically (47-fold, data not shown), beyond that seen with\nthe intron-less constructs, upon co-transfection with SRrp40\n(TASR-2) (16,17). Investigation showed that the level of\ngalactosidase activity was depressed in this case because a\ncryptic upstream 5\u00a2 splice site had been activated by SRrp40.\nSuch instances are unlikely to signi\u00aecantly affect the useful-\nness of the method, as long as a second method is used to\nvalidate the most interesting candidates that emerge from a\nwide initial screen. In addition, it is possible to remove cryptic\nsites from any substrate of interest by mutagenesis.\nThis method is very convenient for a rapid screen with a\npanel of chemicals or co-transfected cDNA. However, a\nscreen for positively acting factors should be done with introns\nthat do not splice with high intrinsic ef\u00aeciency. For example, a\nscreen of SR proteins with pTN23 showed only modest\nimprovements in the ef\u00aeciency of splicing (not shown)\nbecause the level was high initially (Fig. 2B). It is possible\nthat all assays based upon the analysis of spliced and unspliced\nor alternative mRNA in vivo might underestimate the effects\nof positive trans-acting factors. Even when 100% of the\nmRNA has been spliced, such factors could further increase\nthe rate of splicing and thus reduce the losses of pre-mRNA to\ndegradation in the nucleus. This would be manifest only as an\nincreased level of mRNA.\nThis method would be useful to screen chemical libraries to\nidentify drugs that affect speci\u00aec splicing reactions. In this\ncase it would be advantageous to set up stable incorporation of\nthe bi-functional reporter into a mammalian cell line. This\nwould allow screening for chemicals that would rescue or\nsuppress particular splicing reactions in cases where there\nwould be therapeutic implications, as in SMN2 and dystro-\nphin. It would also allow screening of libraries to identify\npotentially toxic chemicals that might inhibit or induce\naberrant patterns of splicing.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank Dr G.
