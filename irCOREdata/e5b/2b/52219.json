Groundwaters dating back to one million years, i.e. \nto beyond the Middle Pleistocene, are only found in major aquifer basins and information is \nrelatively sparse and of low resolution.  Speleothem fluid inclusions offer a way of \nconsiderably increasing this resolution, but both speleothem formation and large-scale \ngroundwater recharge require humid conditions which may be relatively infrequent for areas \ncurrently experiencing arid climates.  Both types of record therefore require caution in their \ninterpretation when considering a particular archaeological context.   \n \n \nIntroduction \n \nAn important element in understanding human evolution is the reaction of hominins \nto climate change.  A powerful technique for doing this is to use the stable isotopic values of \nproxies associated with hominins and their activities.  Some stable isotope ratios (\n13\nC\/\n12\nC, \n15\nN\/ \n14\nN) are primarily used to assess dietary changes or developments, but these are not \nnecessarily linked to climate change.  The isotope ratios associated with water, \n18\nO\/\n16\nO and \n2\nH\/\n1\nH, are on the other hand much more likely to have a direct link. The basic requirement \nfor the understanding of water isotope proxies is then to have a conception of how climatic \nchange affects environmental water isotope values.   \nAt the present day the largest reservoir of \u201eold\u201f environmental fresh water is the ice of \nglaciated regions, with an estimated volume of 24 \u00d7 10\n6\n km\n3\n, but liquid groundwater at 11 \u00d7 \n10\n6\n km\n3\n still represents a substantial store (Gleick, 1996).  When compared to the long, \nhighly-detailed records provided by ice cores from the polar regions (Johnsen et al., 2001; \nEPICA, 2004), groundwater can only be viewed as a coarse-resolution climate archive.  \nNevertheless, from an archaeological point of view it has the advantage of being much more \nwidely distributed than ice, and is potentially of more use in low-latitude \npalaeoenvironmental reconstruction.  Three fundamental methods for interpreting \ngroundwater as an archive exist: stable isotopes, noble gases, and residence-time indicators. \nIt is established that there is generally a strong correlation between surface air \ntemperature and the oxygen or hydrogen stable isotope ratios of rainfall at locations across \nthe globe (Dansgaard, 1964; Rozanski et al., 1992; Fricke and O\u201fNeil 1999).  The precise \nnumerical value of the \u201e\u03b4\u2013T\u201f coefficient for a particular location may be somewhat difficult \nto assign, depending on the way the relationship is derived (e.g. from seasonal measurements \nor inter-annual variation: see Darling et al., 2005), but the relationship is robust enough to \nensure that stable isotopes play a major part in palaeoclimate reconstructions. \nThe isotope hydrology of Quaternary climate change \n 3 \nHowever, there are instances where the isotopic ratios of rainfall have changed \nsignificantly over time owing to alterations in the meteorological regime brought about by \nclimate change.  These isotopic changes are not simply temperature-related, but are the \nproduct of profound alterations in atmospheric circulation patterns.  A major example of this \nis found in the Sahara Desert, where palaeo-recharge to the Nubian Sandstone aquifer is very \ndifferent in isotopic composition from that of present-day rainfall in the region (Sonntag et \nal., 1978; Issar, 1985).  Fortunately for such instances, an independent way of measuring \nrecharge temperature exists in the form of the dissolved noble gases neon, argon, krypton and \nxenon (Mazor, 1972; Andrews and Lee, 1979; Stute et al., 1992). \nPalaeotemperature information by itself is of comparatively little value without a \nreasonably secure dating framework.  The agents used to date long-residence groundwaters \nare exclusively radioisotopes: for example \n14\nC, \n36\nCl and \n81\nKr but, unlike the short-term age \nindicator \n3\nH, none of these forms part of the water molecule and therefore there are usually \nconstraints on interpretation.  \nWhile all three techniques have been applied mainly to groundwaters in aquifer \nbasins, they are also being increasingly used to investigate waters trapped in fluid inclusions \nwithin speleothems.  The purpose of this paper is to review progress in both areas with regard \nto climatic conditions in the later Quaternary.  The importance of such reconstruction in a \ngeneral archaeological context is clear: the \u201crelationship between Plio-Pleistocene climate \nchange and key events in hominin evolution has been a long-term research interest in \npalaeoanthropology\u201d (Petraglia, 2005: 305).  Perhaps this is of greatest significance in East \nAfrica (e.g., Trauth et al., 2007), the location of many key hominin discoveries in Neogene \nand Quaternary deposits.  However, the subsequent dispersal of Homo species could be \nviewed as the point where archaeology begins to acquire a more complex cultural dimension.  \nWaves of migration into the Levant, NW Africa, the northern side of the Mediterranean and \nelsewhere from 1.8 M yr. onwards (e.g., Bar-Yosef and Belfer-Cohen, 2001; Sahnouni et al., \n2002; Carbonell et al., 2008) were undoubtedly climate-mediated to a large extent, mainly via \ncompression of the inter-tropical convergence zone or ITCZ (Trauth et al., 2007), and \ntherefore require a palaeoenvironmental context to aid further understanding.  \n The narrow Levantine corridor, confined between the desert and the Mediterranean \nSea, was particularly important in early hominin migrations and the importance of well-\ncharacterised Middle Pleistocene archaeological sites like Gesher Benot Ya\u201faqov (GBY) is \ndifficult to overstate.  The general scarcity of water in the Middle East of the present day has \nmade it one of the first areas where isotope hydrological techniques have been widely applied \n(Gat and Tzur, 1967; Issar et al., 1972).  Inevitably this led to the desire to know more about \n\u201epalaeo-groundwaters\u201f and therefore palaeo-climates.  The Levant and wider Middle East is a \nregion that has encountered some dramatic climate shifts which have been reflected in major \nchanges in the isotopic composition of environmental water (Geyh et al.,1985; Issar, 1985; \nWeyhenmeyer et al., 1990), and such changes need to be taken into account when \nconsidering the significance of isotope values derived from floral or faunal proxies (Leng, \n2005).  The application of knowledge about climate change derived from palaeo-\ngroundwaters to Holocene human history was an obvious step (e.g. Issar and Zohar, 2004).  \nTo extend this further back in time by one or two orders of magnitude, to encompass \nmigrating Homo sapiens and hominins respectively, is undoubtedly more of a challenge. \n \n \nThe isotope hydrology of Quaternary climate change \n 4 \n \n \n \nPalaeohydrological techniques for studying groundwater  \n \nStable isotopes \n \nOxygen and hydrogen stable isotope ratios are expressed in \u2030 with respect to Vienna \nStandard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW) on the delta scale: \n \n  = [(Rsample\/Rstandard)-1] x 10\n3\n            (1) \n \nwhere Rsample is the \n18\nO\/\n16\nO or \n2\nH\/\n1\nH ratio of the samples, and Rstandard the corresponding ratio \nin VSMOW.   \nStable isotopes in water are considered powerful tools in palaeoclimatology because \nstrong apparent links exist between some relevant meteorological parameters, such as surface \nair temperature or amount of rainfall, and the distribution patterns of stable isotopes in \nrainfall observed for present-day climatic conditions.  Based on this link, there have been \nmany attempts to reconstruct past climatic conditions from records of the isotopic \ncomposition of ancient precipitation preserved, often via proxies, in various environmental \narchives (glacier ice, sediments, groundwater, organic matter, and others: see Leng, 2005). \nHowever, quantitative reconstruction of past climatic changes from proxy records requires \nthat the isotope palaeothermometer or palaeopluviometer be adequately calibrated for the \ntimescales of interest. \nAn apparent link between isotopic composition of precipitation and surface air \ntemperature is most important for palaeoclimate reconstructions (e.g., Fricke and O\u201fNeil, \n1999). Much present-day data has been accumulated by the IAEA-WMO Global Network for \nIsotopes in Precipitation (GNIP, see http:\/\/nds121.iaea.org\/wiser) and various \u03b4\u2013T \ncoefficients have been proposed depending on climate type (Rozanski et al., 1993) and the \ndifferent ways (seasonal, inter-annual or long-term) of quantifying the \u03b4\u2013T relationship \n(Darling et al., 2005).  However, doubts have arisen as to whether present-day \u03b4\u2013T \ncoefficients are wholly appropriate to interpret isotopic records of past precipitation \npreserved in various environmental archives (e.g., Darling et al., 2005).  The implication is \nthat it is always desirable to obtain some \u201ereal\u201f water from the general location recharged \nduring the climatic period in question.  Clearly, direct preservation of palaeo-precipitation is \nimpossible away from polar regions, but fortunately groundwater \u03b418O and \u03b42H values \nusually closely reflect the bulk isotopic composition of the rainfall giving rise to them (Clark \nand Fritz, 1997; Darling et al., 2005).  Within certain limitations, speleothem fluid inclusion \nwater may provide the same function (McDermott et al., 2005). \nMost rainfall originates from evaporation of the ocean in tropical latitudes. Craig \n(1961) proposed that the relationship between O and H isotopes in rainfall over most of the \nEarth\u201fs surface could be approximated by the equation \n \n \u03b42H = 8\u03b418O + 10          (2) \n \nThe validity of this \u201eworld meteoric line\u201f (WML) is surprisingly widespread (Rozanski et al., \n1993) given the great variations in climate world-wide. However, while for the most part \n\u03b418O and \u03b42H are highly correlated in rainfall, some variation can occur as a result of \nThe isotope hydrology of Quaternary climate change \n 5 \natmospheric conditions. A useful index of this is the deuterium excess or d-value (Dansgaard, \n1964), defined as: \n \n d = \u03b42H \u2013 8\u03b418O         (3) \n \nDeuterium excess is considered to be largely controlled by conditions of atmospheric \nhumidity during the oceanic vapour forming process. For the WML in Eqn.(2), d has a value \nof 10\u2030. Much temperate-zone rainfall has similar d-values (Rozanski et al. 1993), though \nthese may show usually modest seasonal variation mainly owing to changes in humidity in \nthe moisture source area.  Under certain conditions however, particularly evaporation of \nseawater into very low-humidity air, d-values exceeding 20\u2030 can be produced (e.g. Gat, \n1980). Such conditions are likely to be restricted to seas adjacent to arid zones such as in the \neastern Mediterranean Sea. \nDeuterium excess can therefore be a good indicator of moisture provenance. \nHowever, both \u03b418O and \u03b42H values are required (unlike for temperature, when either isotope \nis sufficient), and few proxies provide reliable data for both isotopes, leaving groundwater as \nthe most likely source of d-value data. \n \nNoble gas recharge temperatures \n \nThe solubilities of the noble gases He, Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe are temperature dependent, \nthough significant amounts of \n4\nHe can be produced in aquifers by radioactive decay of \nuranium and its daughter products, so in practice the technique is restricted to Ne, Ar, Kr and \nXe.  Nevertheless the existence of four gases still permits a degree of \u201eredundancy,\u201f \neffectively leading to greater accuracy in the calculation of recharge temperatures (RTs).  \nThe technique has a minor drawback in that recharge altitude has to be assumed, but \nprovided relief does not exceed 1000 m or so, any error is likely to be small compared to \nfactors such as measurement precision.  A more important disadvantage is due to the \nphenomenon of \u201eexcess air\u201f (EA).  This arises from the forcible dissolution of air bubbles \nduring the recharge process, and is present in all groundwaters to varying extents, related to \nfactors such as the nature of matrix porosity, amount of fracturing, and magnitude of seasonal \nvariations in the elevation of the water table.  The effect of these factors may change with \nrainfall intensity, and EA has therefore been proposed as a palaeopluviometer (Wilson and \nMcNeill, 1997; Kipfer et al, 2002), but EA is generally viewed as a factor for which \ncorrection is needed.  This is because the excess gas means that the measured noble gas \nconcentrations are no longer solely the product of equilibrium at the recharge temperature. \nSeveral different calculation methods exist to extract reliable RTs from EA \u201enoise\u201f.  \nThey tend to rely on reaching a \u201ebest fit\u201f between the different noble gases.  The two methods \nmainly used are iterative optimisation (e.g., Stute et al., 1995), and inverse modelling (e.g., \nAeschbach-Hertig et al., 1999).  It is not always possible to calculate a realistic RT from \nnoble gas data \u2013 specific instances include perturbations from very high EA contents due to \nglacial overpressuring (e.g., Raidla et al., 2009), or where recharge-derived noble gases have \nbeen diluted by a large amount of terrestrial outgassing of CO2 (e.g., Gilfillan et al, 2008) \u2013 \nbut in general the noble gas RT method provides a temperature yardstick against which \nsecular changes in stable isotopes can be compared.  Typical precision on calculated RTs \nwould be within \u00b11\u00b0C.       \nRecently the use of noble gases to investigate the RT of speleothem fluid inclusions \nhas commenced (Kluge et al., 2008; Scheidegger et al., 2010).  As with the stable isotopes, \nThe isotope hydrology of Quaternary climate change \n 6 \nthis promises to increase profoundly the resolution of palaeo-information about water \nbecause of the great increase in time resolution potentially obtainable via uranium-series \ndating of the rock matrix (see next section).   \n \nResidence time indicators \n \nAny information derived from stable isotopes and noble gases is of little use for \npalaeoclimate studies unless constrained by age.  The coarse resolution of groundwater as a \nclimate archive, resulting from dispersion and advection effects (Stute and Schlosser, 1993), \nmeans that only long-range dating techniques are relevant.  Radioisotopes dissolved in \ngroundwater are generally recognised as being satisfactory for an age range covering about \nsix half-lives; for example \n14\nC, with a half-life (t1\/2) of 5730 years, can be used for ages up to \naround 35 k yr.  Other principal age indicators are \n36\nCl (t1\/2 300 k.yr.) and \n81\nKr (t1\/2 230 k.yr.); \nclearly either of these isotopes has the potential to cover large parts, if not all of the \nPleistocene.  The isotope \n4\nHe, mentioned above in connection with noble gas RTs also has \npotential as a long-range age indicator (Mazor and Bosch, 1992), but by accumulation rather \nthan decay.  Since individual aquifers behave very differently in their helium production \nrates, \n4\nHe requires careful calibration against other age indicators and is not considered \nfurther here. \nEach of the isotopes \n14\nC, \n36\nCl and \n81\nKr has various constraints on its use.  These may \nbe practical, e.g., the necessity to outgas several cubic metres of water for \n81\nKr (Sturchio et \nal., 2004), or geochemical, e.g., uncertainties about subsurface augmentation for \n36\nCl (Phillips \net al., 1986), or dilution for \n14\nC (Clark and Fritz, 1997).  Analysis, especially of \n36\nCl and \n81\nKr, \nis also relatively costly.  Nevertheless, they remain the only feasible options for Pleistocene \ngroundwater dating. \nSpeleothem fluid inclusion waters are far too low in volume to date directly by \n14\nC, \n36\nCl or \n81\nKr techniques.  Even if this were possible, the dates would be subject to the same \nuncertainties as for groundwaters.  However, on the assumptions that fluid inclusions are \nwell-sealed against post-depositional modification, the use of uranium-series dating of the \nspeleothem matrix (Schwarcz, 1992) is not only less costly but also clearly offers the \nprospect of very much higher resolution.  Using current analytical methods the technique is \nsatisfactory up to 600 k yr. \n \nUncertainties \n \nStable isotopes  Based on data from numerous studies, \u03b418O and \u03b42H in groundwater usually \nreflect the weighted mean of local precipitation to within quite close tolerances (about \u00b10.5\u2030 \nfor \n18O and \u00b15\u2030 for \u03b42H [Darling et al., 2005]).  However, while this seems to be a useful \nrule of thumb for temperate and tropical humid climates, it may apply less successfully to \nsemi-arid or strongly seasonal climates.  In the former case there is often simply a lack of \nlong term rainfall data, making any comparison difficult.  In the latter case, winter snow \ncover or very seasonal recharge could upset the balance.  For example, snowmelt runoff \nmight exceed aquifer recharge capacity, or the isotopic composition of strongly seasonal \nrecharge might reflect winter or summer air temperature rather than mean annual \ntemperature.  However, the available evidence for these proposed effects is restricted to \nisolated examples (see references in Darling, 2004), and it seems unlikely that a major \ngroundwater body would not be closely representative of the precipitation giving rise to it.  \nThat said, there are cases of groundwaters recharged via lakes where large positive isotopic \nfractionations are possible (Darling et al., 2005).  However, such modification would \nThe isotope hydrology of Quaternary climate change \n 7 \nnormally be detected by changes in the relationship between \u03b418O and \u03b42H compared to the \nworld meteoric line (Craig, 1961), and by hydrochemical indicators. \nAt least two potential isotope effects arise with regard to dripwaters before they reach \nthe site of speleothem formation.  Firstly, the altitude of recharge may not be known with \ncertainty, secondly, there may be selection of recharge by season, individual precipitation \nevent or other factor (see discussion in Darling et al., 2005 and references therein).  The first \nwould cause isotopic depletion increasing with rise in recharge altitude, while the second \ncould have some unpredictable effects, depending on residence time in the soil zone and \nduring further percolation.  Maximum deviations from weighted precipitation might be \nexpected for dripwaters under cold or arid climates, though in general it appears that the \neffects are not serious enough to hinder the reconstruction of palaeoclimate, as demonstrated \nin the much-studied Soreq Cave of Israel (e.g., Ayalon et al., 1998).  Isotopic fractionation \neffects during speleothem growth are probably more significant in this regard. While they lie \nbeyond the scope of this review they have been amply covered (e.g.,  McDermott et al., 2005; \nLachniet, 2009). \nNoble gases The recharge temperature information provided by noble gases dissolved in \ngroundwater is considered related to conditions at the water table.  Unless the unsaturated \nzone is very thick, at least many tens to hundreds of metres, the temperature at the water table \n(RT) is likely to be very similar to mean annual air temperature (MAAT).  Furthermore, \nbeneath depths of around 1\u20131.5 m the temperature of the soil is almost completely damped in \nrelation to surface variations. Most water tables lie at greater depths so it is  likely that \nstrongly seasonal recharge becomes equilibrated to soil temperature and therefore reflects \nMAAT.  Indeed the use of noble gas RTs in palaeoenvironmental reconstruction is predicated \non this link. \nHowever, under certain circumstances there may be departures of RT from MAAT.  If \nseasonal rainfall is high enough in amount, full temperature equilibration may not be \nachieved until below the water table, though in general this effect will be well within \u00b11\u00b0C of \nMAAT.  More significant changes are likely to occur in areas with significant seasonal snow \ncover, where the snow insulates the soil against winter air temperature changes.  According to \nCey (2009), this could lead to RT being up to ~1.5\u00b0C warmer than MAAT.  Clearly this is a \nfactor that needs consideration if climate change is likely to have caused major changes in the \namount of snow in a particular recharge area. \nThe \u03b4\u2013T relationship Several processes have been identified which may lead to long-term \nalterations in the \u03b4\u2013T link over time in a given area: changes in the source region of moisture, \nchanges in the isotopic composition of the ocean, changes of atmospheric circulation patterns \nshifting the sources and\/or routes of the air masses causing precipitation, and changes in \nseasonality of precipitation (see references in Darling et al., 2005).  In theory at least, all four \nof these factors could be operating concurrently, making it difficult to unravel the magnitude \nof one particular effect.  The interpretation of \u03b4\u2013T data therefore requires as much \ncircumstantial evidence as possible (e.g., the ocean isotopic composition at the time from \nforaminiferal evidence, GCM estimates of air flow patterns) to narrow down the options. \nResidence time indicators There are significant uncertainties associated with groundwater age \nindicators.  Rock dilution of \n14\nC and subsurface augmentation of \n36\nCl have already been \nmentioned, but there are others of equal or greater importance.  For example, unlike for the \nstable isotopes and noble gases, where measurement precisions remain effectively the same \nacross their ranges, radioisotope relative standard deviations become much larger as the \ndetection limits are approached, although this can always be acknowledged in the age error \nbars for a particular sample.   \nA more fundamental problem is what a water age actually represents. In ideal terms \nthe residence time of groundwater is a simple function of its distance from the point of \nThe isotope hydrology of Quaternary climate change \n 8 \nsurface recharge.  Figure 1a depicts a thin porous sandstone aquifer where water age will be \nin proportion to the distance from outcrop down the flowline \u2013 so-called \u201episton flow\u201f.  \nFigure 1b however shows a perhaps more common situation where the aquifer is thicker and \nhas some stratification, leading to number of flow horizons.  Depending on where and how \nmuch of the aquifer is penetrated by a screened borehole, the same mean residence time \n(masking different age distributions) could be measured on samples from different parts of \nthe aquifer.  While this can be addressed to some extent by a knowledge of borehole \nconstruction details, records of these are commonly either difficult to access or not available.  \nIn the case of fractured aquifers (Fig 1c), simple intergranular flow is overtaken by \nsignificantly faster flow along conduits of varying size, conceivably accompanied by mixing \nof waters of different ages.  A knowledge of inflow horizons from borehole geophysics can \nhelp to some extent, but for the most part fractured aquifers are better avoided as \npalaeoclimate archives (Darling et al., 1997). \n \nFIGURE 1 \n \nThe effects of climate change on groundwater at the basin scale \n \nAquifer characteristics and groundwater residence time \n \nIn order for groundwater to be in residence long enough to preserve evidence of \nrecharge under different climatic conditions, an aquifer must be confined by under- and \noverlying impermeable rocks (aquicludes).  Then residence time ideally becomes a function \nof piston flow through the aquifer, the velocity of which is governed by a combination of \naquifer size and discharge rate.  The implication of this is that while aquifers relatively small \nin areal terms (and therefore flowpath length) may contain waters in excess of 50 k.yr. old \n(e.g., some of the aquifers in the UK: Darling et al., 1997), only very large systems are likely \nto contain water in the age range 100\u20131000 k.yr. (e.g., the Great Artesian Basin of Australia: \nBentley et al., 1986). \nThe small aquifers tend to be relatively well characterised in terms of age and palaeo-\nrecharge conditions.  The sheer size of the major aquifer basins, and sparse networks of the \ndeep boreholes necessary to sample groundwater from different points along the assumed \nflowpaths makes such characterisation more difficult, but these basins present the only \nopportunity to measure \u201eactive\u201f groundwaters in the age range 105\u2013106 yrs (as opposed to \nwaters trapped in speleothems, whose origins may be obscured by pre- or post-depositional \ndiagenetic processes).  \nBy far the best documentation of climate change effects on groundwater recharge \ncomes from studies of aquifers in which groundwater age spans the interval from modern to \n~30 k.yr., in other words from the Holocene to the late Pleistocene, and including the Last \nGlacial Maximum (LGM).  Examples of such aquifers will be considered first, followed by a \nnecessarily briefer treatment of the much less well-understood major basins containing older \ngroundwaters. \n \nRecording climate change over the LGM and the Pleistocene-Holocene transition \n \nFigure 2 shows plots of \n18\nO versus radiocarbon age for a number of sandstone \naquifers in Europe (limestone aquifers tend to be rather worse archives: Darling et al., 1997).  \nImmediately prior to the Holocene there is evidence for a time interval in the late Devensian \nduring which there was little or no groundwater recharge over much of Europe, and indeed \nthis is reflected (at least in the UK) by the lowest speleothem growth rate in the past 300 k.yr. \nThe isotope hydrology of Quaternary climate change \n 9 \n(Gordon et al., 1989).  The \u201erecharge gap\u201f is best developed in the more northerly aquifers \nwhere it apparently may have lasted for several thousands of years, but even in the Aveiro \naquifer of northern Portugal, the closest to a supply of rainfall (i.e. the tropical ocean), there \nare signs of a hiatus in recharge.  This absence of recharge has been attributed to the \nexistence of permafrost conditions, but since the effect can be discerned to varying extents in \nlocalities such as the Levant (Geyh et al., 1985) and North Africa (Edmunds et al., 2004) it \nmay simply be related to low moisture supply, or in other words a general aridity resulting \nfrom the sequestration of additional water in the icecaps of the LGM.   \n \nFIGURE 2 \n \nIn all the cases in Figure 2, and others across the world (e.g., Kimmelmann e Silva et \nal., 1989; Zhu, 2000; Chen et al., 2003), there is a shift in stable isotopic composition \nbetween Holocene and older groundwaters.  The magnitude of the shifts is variable and \nusually positively correlated with temperature (the negative correlation from Portugal is \nsimply the result of temperature-related isotopic depletion being outweighed by enrichment \nof the ocean moisture source by the \u201eice effect\u201f: Condesso de Melo et al., 2001).  The \nquestion therefore arises as to the nature of the \u03b4\u2013T link during recharge.  There have been \nfewer studies where noble-gas RTs have been measured, but sufficient research exists to \npermit some discussion of temperature effects.  Three widely-separated examples are \nconsidered in detail: the aquifers underlying the North China Plain, the Hungarian Plain, and \nthe Uitenhage basin of southeastern South Africa. \n \nFIGURE 3 \n \nNorth China Plain Kreuzer et al. (2009) measured samples along a flowline in the confined \naquifer system in the area south of Beijing (area location in Figure 3).  As with the European \nexamples considered above, a recharge gap during the LGM is apparent (Figure 4), so \npossible minimum isotope and RT values may not be represented.  However, a difference of \napproximately 4.5\u00b0C between present (13\u00b0C) and pre-LGM recharge conditions is observed, \naccompanied by an isotopic depletion of about 2\u2030 \u03b418O.  This would be equivalent to a \u03b4\u2013T \ncoefficient of 0.44\u2030, higher than the \u03b4\u2013T relationship currently observed for rainfall in this \nregion of China, which lies in the range 0.11\u20130.15\u2030.  However, Kreuzer et al. (2009) \nconcluded that only about half the isotopic change was due to rising temperature, the other \nhalf being due to a weakening in monsoon strength (with implications for moisture source \nand\/or humidity changes) as the Holocene progressed.  This conclusion was based on stable \nisotope compositions, which had a higher deuterium excess value at the beginning of the \nHolocene (Figure 5).  Assuming the purely temperature-related rise in \u03b418O has been only \n1\u00b0C, a \u03b4\u2013T coefficient of 0.22\u2030 is indicated, significantly closer to the modern rainfall value.  \n \nFIGURE 4 \n \nFIGURE 5 \n \nHungarian Plain The Quaternary (\u201eQ\u201f) aquifer was sampled by Stute and Deak (1989) along a \nsection of 150 km broadly increasing in age southwestward of Fehergyarmat in northeastern \nHungary (area location in Figure 3).  Some of the interest in this dataset lies in the minimum \nRTs with very late glacial ages around 15 k.yr. (Figure 6).  These interrupt what would \notherwise seem to be a long recharge gap (though this could simply be a function of sample \navailability).  However, further samples of this apparent cool recharge would be necessary to \nThe isotope hydrology of Quaternary climate change \n 10 \ngive a more robust confirmation of a cold-but-humid episode.  In considering the \u03b4\u2013T \nrelationship in relation to other cases reviewed here, it is more consistent to take the pre-25 \nk.yr. recharge temperatures.  These show that for a decrease of 5\u00b0C from present values, there \nis a depletion of ~2.5\u2030 in \u03b418O.  This suggests a \u03b4\u2013T coefficient of 0.5\u2030, which is typical of \ncontinental interiors at the present day.  There is evidence for reduced d-excess during the \napparently coldest period (Figure 5), which implies high humidity in the moisture source \narea, though as with the recharge temperatures, more confirmation is desirable.  \n \nFIGURE 6 \n \nUitenhage Basin The Uitenhage aquifer (area location in Figure 3) consists of fractured \nquartzites which dip to the SSE beneath a confining layer of shales (Heaton et al., 1986).  The \nsampled flowline is relatively short (about 30 km) but flow through the quartzite is slow and \ncorrected radiocarbon ages of up to ~30 k.yr. have been measured.  Figure 7 shows plots of \n\u03b418O and RT versus corrected age.  The \u03b418O change is well-defined and shows a depletion of \n1\u2030 between the present and the period 20\u201330 k.yr.  Over the same period, RT also falls, and \nthough the scatter is greater, it is clear that a difference of some 6\u00b0C is involved.  As before, \nthe size of the coefficient needs to be considered in the context of possible humidity \nvariations, but in this case proximity to the ocean is also a factor.  Heaton et al. (1986) \ndemonstrated that d-excess values in the Uitenhage groundwaters remained very constant \n(Figure 5), suggesting that moisture source tracks remained similar over time.  The relatively \nhigh values of the d-excess imply that the present \u201eMediterranean\u201f climate of the area has \nexisted for at least 30 k.yr.  Therefore, no correction to the \u03b4\u2013T coefficient is required for \nhumidity.  As far as ocean proximity is concerned, the 1\u2030 rise in oceanic \u03b418O is likely to \nhave affected weighted mean rainfall to a similar extent.  If this rise is added to the 1\u2030 \nchange observed in the aquifer, a \u03b4\u2013T coefficient of 0.33\u2030 for \u03b418O is indicated.   \n \nFIGURE 7 \n \nIt is clear from the three diverse examples considered above that the combination of \nstable isotopes and noble gas RTs in groundwater at the basin scale can provide information \non various aspects of large-scale climatic changes, which can provide a context for the \ninterpretation of more-detailed proxy isotope data.  However, these studies have been based \non the relatively secure foundation of radiocarbon dating.  Moving beyond this age range \nprovides some challenges. \n \nThe major aquifer basins: groundwater ages of up to a million years \n \nThe inference of palaeoclimatic conditions derived from groundwater in large basins \nis compromised both by a shortage of sampling points and the relatively large errors on water \ndates.  Nevertheless progress has been made with three major systems: the Great Artesian \nBasin of central\u2013eastern Australia, the Continental Intercalaire of Algeria and Tunisia, and \nthe Nubian sandstone of northeast Africa.  A fourth system, the Guarani aquifer of Argentina, \nBrazil, Paraguay and Uruguay is being investigated (Sracek and Hirata, 2002; Bonotto and \nJim\u00e9nez-Rueda, 2007), but to date there are insufficient data to attempt any palaeoclimatic \ninterpretation. \nThe Great Artesian Basin of Australia The GAB has provided a test-bed sufficiently large for \nthe application of \n36\nCl, \n81\nKr and other dating techniques (Bentley et al., 1986; Lehmann et al., \n2003; Kulongoski et al., 2008).  However, the size and complexity of the basin makes \nsampling along a particular flowpath a difficult proposition so there are few instances where \nThe isotope hydrology of Quaternary climate change \n 11 \nRT, stable isotope composition and age are known for the same sampling points.  The results \nof one such study (Lehmann et al., 2003; study location in Figure 3) are shown in Figure 8a.  \nOwing to the extremely low concentrations of \n81\nKr, the error bars on individual ages are \nrelatively much larger than for radiocarbon ages.  The \u03b418O values of the four samples lie \nwithin the range of modern to sub-recent groundwaters in the recharge area in eastern \nAustralia (Radke et al., 2000).  Noble gas RTs measured on the same samples gave \ntemperatures in the range 23\u201327\u00b0C, which is only slightly above temperature measurements \nin shallow boreholes in the recharge area.  There is no evidence for long-term changes in the \nnature of moisture supply to the GAB. \n \nFIGURE 8 \n \nThe Continental Intercalaire of the northern Sahara This aquifer underlies a significant area \nof northern Algeria and extends into Tunisia (study location in Figure 3), where its \ngroundwater eventually discharges into saline lakes (chotts) or directly into the \nMediterranean in the Gulf of Gabes.  Slow flow through the formation suggests hydraulic \nages of up to ~1 M.yr., and this appears to be confirmed by ages based on \n36\nCl (Guendouz \nand Michelot, 2006).  Figure 8b shows a plot of \u03b418O versus residence time.  While the \ndataset shows no significant variation with time, it is known that modern recharge to the \nContinental Intercalaire is 3\u2030 enriched (Edmunds et al., 2003).  This indicates that the \npresent climate of the area is inconsistent with the long-term mean.    \n \nThe Nubian sandstone of the Western Desert, Egypt The Nubian is a vast groundwater \nresource underlying 2 million km\n2\n of northeast Africa (Thorweihe, 1990), with slow-moving \nwaters likely to be of great age simply on hydraulic grounds.  As Sturchio et al. state, \u201cThe \nage of groundwater is one of the most elusive geologic parameters to quantify\u2026\u201d (2004: 1).  \nNevertheless the results from that paper and a related one by Patterson et al. (2005) show \nreasonably good agreement between the \n36\nCl and \n81\nKr techniques (Figure 8c; study location  \nin Figure 3).  The figure also shows a considerable difference between isotope ratios of \nmodern and palaeo-recharge.  While this was already known from waters of radiocarbon age \nin the general area (e.g., Gat and Issar, 1974; Sonntag et al., 1978; Darling et al., 1987; \nVengosh et al., 2007) and attributed to changes in the ITCZ, the Sturchio et al. (2004) and \nPatterson et al. (2005) studies suggest a recurring predominant Atlantic source of rainfall for \nat least the past million years. \n \n \nGroundwater at the micro-scale and its potential as a palaeoclimate resource \n \nFluid inclusion waters \n \nStable isotopes (especially \u03b42H) have been measured on fluid inclusions or waters of \ncrystallisation formed under temperature and pressure conditions ranging from near-\natmospheric to hydrothermal.  While some applications have been investigated (e.g., Sofer, \n1978; Bath et al., 1987; Buck and Van Hoesen, 2005), the palaeoclimatic information \nobtainable from hydrated minerals or hydrothermal inclusions is likely to be limited owing to \nexchange reactions, so in general, greater credence has been given to speleothem inclusion \nwaters as being more likely to reflect ambient atmospheric conditions.  As with \ngroundwaters, supporting evidence of temperature and age are important. \nNoble gas thermometry of speleothem inclusions is at a very early stage but Kluge et \nal. (2008) demonstrated the possibility of obtaining precisions not far off those achieved for \nThe isotope hydrology of Quaternary climate change \n 12 \nbasin groundwaters.  Limiting factors include the need to obtain an adequate separation of air \nand water inclusions, and the fact that lattice-trapping of He and Ne restricts the gases \nuseable for RT purposes to Ar, Kr and Xe (Scheidegger et al., 2010).  So far the technique \nhas been tried for Holocene speleothems only, and it remains to be seen whether it is robust \nenough to be extended back in time by two orders of magnitude.  As a form of validation the \nmethod could be checked using the clumped-isotope approach (Affek et al., 2008).                                              \nThe dating of speleothems by uranium-series decay (also known in this context as \nuranium-thorium dating) is a well-tested method (e.g., van Calsteren and Thomas, 2006), \nrelying on the degree to which equilibrium has been restored between \n230\nTh and its parent \n234\nU within an individual sample.  While there can be problems when detrital material is \npresent (e.g., Schwarcz, 1992) or the system is too open, in general no correction is required \n(unlike radiocarbon or, for that matter, the \n36\nCl and \n81\nKr methods of water dating).  The \nlength of speleothem required for a U-Th date is generally equivalent to a deposition time of \n5\u201350 years, far less than the analytical error of the dating method.  Using current analytical \ntechniques, U-Th dating is limited to dates of up to ~600 k.yr.  Other than this, perhaps the \nmain limitation on speleothems as a source of stable isotopic information is that they tend not \nto grow during arid periods whether warm or cold (but then, as shown in Figures 2, 4, 6 and \n7, groundwater recharge is also restricted for the same reason). \nAlthough some \u03b418O measurements have been made on fluid inclusion waters (e.g., \nDennis et al., 2001, McDermott et al., 2005), the main object is usually to obtain \u03b42H values \nwhich can then be compared with water \u03b418O values inferred from carbonate \u03b418O \nmeasurements.  The latter can be performed by micro-milling (Sp\u00f6tl and Mattey, 2006), \ngiving far higher resolution than could be provided by the relatively large samples needed to \nprovide sufficient inclusions for a \u03b418O measurement (between one and two orders of \nmagnitude higher than the amount required for a \u03b42H determination).  Once inclusion \u03b42H \nvalues are known, these can be combined with the inferred water \u03b418O values to obtain the \npalaeoclimatic \u201eholy grail\u201f of d-excess (discussed earlier), with its implications for change (or \nlack of it) in moisture source area and therefore in air mass movements over time.  Generally \nthe precision on direct \u03b42H measurements is good.  Figure 9 shows a typical example based \non a study of a cave in Oman (Fleitmann et al., 2003; location in Figure 3).  Although the \nspread of samples at around 120 k yr. certainly exceeds \u03b42H measurement precision, the \nmeasured age range is actually greater than 10 k.yr.  Even after factoring in the resolution of \nthe U-Th method (averaging \u00b12.4 k.yr. in this age range), the changes could still be reflecting \nchanges in climate taking place over intervals of ~5 k.yr.   \n \nFIGURE 9 \n \nUnsaturated zone pore waters \n \nAnother micro-scale phenomenon with the potential to record isotopic changes over \nlong time periods is the existence of pore waters in thick unsaturated zones.  The unsaturated \nzone, also sometimes referred to as the vadose zone, is that part of an aquifer formation \nwhich overlies the water table.  Depending on a combination of geology and the humidity of \nthe climate, unsaturated zone thicknesses can range from a meter or less to many hundreds of \nmetres.  Unsaturated zone profiles up to tens of metres thick have often been measured for \npurposes of estimating aquifer recharge rates, but residence times based on tritium \nmeasurements have only been of the order of 10\n1\u2013102 years (Cook et al., 1992). \nIn a sufficiently deep profile, however, traces of recharge water of much greater age \nmay be preserved.  Because of the resources required, few of these ultra-deep unsaturated \nzones have been investigated, but a good example is provided by a study carried out at the \nThe isotope hydrology of Quaternary climate change \n 13 \nNevada Test Site by Tyler et al. (1996).  Here, pore-water samples from three unsaturated \nzone profiles extending to more than 230 m deep were analysed for stable isotopes and \n36\nCl.  \nPore waters found at depth in the profiles ranged from 20 k.yr.\u2013120 k.yr. in age, with isotope \ndepletions of up to ~3\u2030 in \u03b418O compared to modern precipitation.  However, d-excess \nvalues were similar to those of the present day, suggesting that recharge was derived from the \nsame type of air mass movement, but at a lower temperature. \nInevitably, processes of diffusion and dispersion limit the resolution of these profiles \ncompared to those available from speleothems or high-latitude ice cores.  There is also \ncurrently no way of extracting information on recharge temperature.  Nevertheless the \ntechnique provides a possible way of checking on speleothem isotope values in the more arid \nareas. \n \n \nDiscussion \n \nThe combination of three different approaches to investigating groundwater as an \narchive \u2013 stable isotopes, recharge temperature and water age \u2013 is paying dividends in \npalaeoclimate studies; evidence dating back to the Early\u2013Middle Pleistocene boundary and \nbeyond can now be obtained.  However, there is nearly always some room for improvement \nin investigation techniques, whether field- or laboratory-based.  The following are areas \nwhere some progress can be anticipated. \nThe dating of aquifer basin waters will improve.  Coupled transport and geochemical \nmodels will make radiocarbon dating more secure, though with the proviso that \u201ecalibration\u201f \n(i.e., allowing for secular changes in cosmic ray flux) is inherently difficult with \ngroundwater.  There will be lower-volume sampling for \n81\nKr (Yokochi et al., 2008), and \nperhaps cheaper analysis for \n36\nCl.  Noble gas analysis will become more precise and recharge \ntemperature modelling will become ever more sophisticated.   \nDespite such improvements, however, it is debatable whether this will benefit \npalaeoenvironmental characterisation in an archaeological context compared to a situation \nwith less demanding time-resolution requirements, such as the assessment of nuclear \nrepository potential.  The reason for this is of course the increasing blurring of the \ngroundwater record with increase in residence time (also a factor in the interpretation of deep \nunsaturated zone moisture profiles).  A comparison of Figures 8b and 8c with Figure 9 \nillustrates the problem.  While the palaeoclimatic shifts in North Africa and the Arabian \nPeninsula may not be directly comparable, it seems likely that major recharge periods in \nNorth Africa would have been as episodic as those indicated by the Oman cave data, but this \nis simply not discernable from the low temporal resolution of the available groundwater data. \nThe above implies that fluid inclusion studies will be more important than \ngroundwaters for archaeology, problems of cave recharge derivation or modification \nnotwithstanding (e.g., recharge altitude, mixing, kinetic fractionation: Lachniet, 2009; Meyer \net al., 2009).  It remains to be seen whether noble gas RT measurements are going to be \nwidely employable on speleothems, but even if relatively few turn out to have sufficiently \nlow gas\/water ratios, the information obtained would still be an advance over the present \nsituation. More rapid ways of processing and measuring inclusion \u03b42H values are likely to be \ndevised, leading to higher-resolution d-excess records.  However, this supposes that inclusion \nsealing times are not excessive, and that inclusions remain sealed off for up to 1 M.yr. and \nbeyond.  Neither of these may be easy to demonstrate conclusively, though the data of \nFleitmann et al. (2003) in Figure 9 suggest that satisfactory sealing on such timescales is at \nleast sometimes achieved.  U-Th dating of speleothems (and hopefully therefore their \ninclusion fluids) has been pursued with great success, but while better measurement \nThe isotope hydrology of Quaternary climate change \n 14 \ntechniques may push the limit a little further towards 1 M.yr., Early Pleistocene \ninvestigations require different dating techniques such as ESR (electron spin resonance) or U-\nPb, both of which have so far proved rather more challenging than U-Th when applied to \nspeleothems and tufas (e.g., Skinner, 2000; Woodhead et al., 2006).  \nHowever, even the potentially high resolution obtainable from speleothem inclusions \ncan provide only a partial picture of the palaeoenvironment because only the wetter climatic \nphases tend to be represented.  What of drier conditions, such as those of present day deserts?  \nIt rains periodically over at least some parts of the North African desert, as well as in Oman, \nbut does not recharge the aquifer basins or contribute to speleothem formation to any \nsignificant degree.  Despite this, human communities exploiting shallow water resources \nmanage to exist in the areas.  The relatively enriched isotopic compositions of modern \nrainfall and recharge (e.g., Figures 8b, 8c and 9) are only known from direct measurements at \nthe present day.  While proxies other than speleothems may retain evidence of past low-\nrecharge episodes in isotopic terms, RT will have to be inferred using other means.  \nArchaeological investigations need to take this into consideration when dealing with hominin \nsites active under more arid conditions. \nFor example, although the long (100 k.yr.) sedimentary record from the GBY site \nprovides no evidence that the palaeolake Hula ever dried out completely, changes in sediment \ntype indicate some fluctuation in lake level (Feibel, 2004).  Since there is no reason to believe \nthat the basic hydrological context of the valley (situated between Mount Hermon and the \nGolan Heights) was fundamentally different from that of the present day, the sedimentary \nrecord can be interpreted very largely in terms of water supply and therefore palaeoclimate.  \nBased on the presence or absence of various fauna and flora, and the \u03b418O values of \nViviparids, Spiro et al. (2009) inferred a cold and dry start to the sequence, but a trend \ntowards warmer conditions more or less coinciding with the Early\u2013Middle Pleistocene \nboundary.  Only once these warmer conditions had settled down in terms of intensity of \nwet\/dry fluctuations, about halfway (chronologically) through the sequence, are hominin \nrelics widely recorded (Goren-Inbar et al., 2000).  But such relics are also known from the \npreceding cold dry period, and recharge temperature(s) inferred from isotope proxies alone \nwould be subject to all the uncertainties regarding \u03b4\u2013T that have been considered earlier, \nhence the use of complementary floral and faunal evidence by Spiro et al. (2009). \n \nConclusions \nAlthough high-latitude ice cores provide an isotopic record of unequalled resolution \nfor much of the Quaternary, there is always likely to be a displacement between their isotope \nvalues and those of contemporaneous precipitation away from the polar regions.  Therefore at \nlower latitudes proxy records become important, but require a degree of calibration against \n\u201ereal\u201f water to realise their full potential. \nGroundwater in either free or trapped form can act as an archive of palaeoclimate.  To \naccess this, age and recharge temperature need to be measured in addition to oxygen and \nhydrogen stable isotope ratios.  Recharge temperature can be calculated from the solubility of \nthe noble gases neon, argon, krypton and xenon, while residence time since recharge (i.e., \ngroundwater age) can be assessed by the use of the radioactive isotopes of carbon, chlorine \nand krypton. \nConfined aquifers commonly contain waters whose age extends back into the Late \nPleistocene.  In particular, the transition between the Pleistocene and the Holocene \u2013 \ncolloquially the \u201eend of the ice age,\u201f a critical period in archaeology \u2013 is characterised \nreasonably well across the world.  Using the above investigation techniques, it has been \ndemonstrated that present-day relationships between recharge temperature and groundwater \nThe isotope hydrology of Quaternary climate change \n 15 \nstable isotope ratios do not always apply under past precipitation regimes; therefore caution is \nnecessary in interpreting proxy isotope data in terms of palaeotemperature. \nMajor aquifer basins such as those underlying North Africa or eastern Australia have \nbeen shown to contain waters up to 1 M.yr., i.e., dating back to Middle Pleistocene times.  \nHowever, sparsely-distributed boreholes and technical challenges in the water dating process \nhave meant these groundwater bodies are less well understood than the smaller basins. \nGroundwaters from basins large or small form a low-resolution archive.  Speleothem \nfluid inclusion waters have the potential to provide much higher resolution, and efforts are \nunderway to measure temperatures of formation.  While it seems unlikely that inclusion \nwaters will ever be directly datable, uranium-series dating of the speleothem matrix offers a \nway of assigning an age to the waters.  Deep unsaturated zone pore waters are something of a \n\u201ehalfway house\u201f between aquifers and speleothems, but require rather specific conditions to \nbe preserved. \nIt must always be remembered that both aquifer basins and speleothems are only \nrecharged or formed under reasonably humid conditions.  Present-day evidence shows that \nhuman communities can exist naturally under more arid conditions.  Archaeological \ninvestigations of dry-climate sites need to bear in mind that proxy isotope data may be \ndifficult to relate to the climatic regime prevailing at the time because of the lack of \ninformation about recharge temperature.  \n \nAcknowledgments \n \nThis review arose from discussions with Dr Baruch Spiro, and an invitation from Prof. \nNaama Goren-Inbar to attend the workshop \"Climate change in the Upper Jordan Valley \nbetween ca 800 and 700ka ago \u2013 its impact on the environment and hominins and its potential \nas prediction for future scenarios\" held at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem May 2009, \nsupported by the Israel Science Foundation.

Schematics to illustrate the effect of aquifer type on groundwater flow and \nresidence time: (a) simple sandstone aquifer with good intergranular permeability acting as a \nsingle conduit (\u201episton flow\u201f) with separate narrow age distributions around the mean for \ngroundwaters from boreholes 1 and 2, (b) a thicker sandstone aquifer with layering leading to \nstacked flow lines, with water residence time depending on the average of flows intercepted \nby each borehole (flowlines A and B are the same length, so boreholes 1 and 2 would provide \ngroundwater with the same mean age even though 2 is 50% further away from outcrop); age \ndistributions vary depending on the proportion of the aquifer penetrated by the borehole, (c) a \nfractured limestone aquifer where groundwater flow can \u201ebypass\u201f intergranular flow by \nflowing more rapidly along fractures, thus indicating a lower mean residence time than BH 1 \nin case (b), but with a broad age distribution. \n \nPlots of \n18\nO versus \n14\nC age for selected sandstone aquifers in Europe, illustrating the change \nin stable isotope composition accompanying the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene \nclimate.  Note the evidence for the late-Pleistocene \u201erecharge gap\u201f. Typical radiocarbon age \nprecisions are indicated by error bars on samples from the East Midlands aquifer.
