This paper discusses six case studies and several\nthemes from research on ideas for educational machinima including: access to\nproduction; creativity in teaching and learning; media intervention methodology;\nproduction models; reusability; visualisation and simulation.\nKeywords: digital media; immersive virtual worlds; machinima; simulation; media\ninterventions\nIntroduction\nImmersive Virtual Worlds (IVWs) have attracted the attention of educators over recent\nyears, especially since the release of Second Life, one of the most popular of several\ninternet-based virtual worlds (Littleton and Bayne 2008). The value and attraction of\nIVWs to education is in the ease they promise the general educational user for creating\nsimulations in an immersive, abstracted space, offering students the opportunity to\nsynchronously encounter authentic experiences involving other people, objects and envi-\nronments. Interest in simulation is growing amongst educators who believe experiential\nlearning has a role in engaging students (Aldrich 2005; Dickey 2005; de Freitas 2006)\nand that the visualisation of ideas accommodates a range of learning styles and teaching\nstrategies (Burbules 1999).\nThe opportunities offered by IVWs are counterbalanced by barriers to access including:\nlack of academic technical literacy and commitment to learn new technology; academic\ninertia; the threat to academic freedom and autonomy; usability; reliability; affordability;\n*Corresponding author. Email: a.j.middleton@shu.ac.uk\n208  A.J. Middleton and R. Mather\ncompatibility; and support requirements. Will academics risk hours of their time in\ndeveloping teaching on the chance that the technology enhances the curriculum (Roberts\n2008; Collis and Moonen 2002; Shephard 2003)?\nThe authors have previously explored the potential of digital media in the context of\nstudent-centred pedagogies and this has resulted in various \u2018media intervention\u2019 curriculum\ndesign methodologies, including audio feedback, educational podcasting models, student-\ngenerated video and digital storytelling.\nIn this development media intervention techniques are connected with IVWs through the\nprocess of making digital video learning objects on IVW virtual film sets. The collaborative\ndesign of films made in IVWs, known as machinima, proved to be a rewarding exercise,\nleading to the generation of six storyboards and a better understanding of the benefits,\nchallenges and potential of educational machinima.\nThis paper presents six short case studies of design conversations with academics, repre-\nsenting a range of disciplines, towards finding more widespread applications for IVWs in\nengaging learners in higher education curricula.\nBackground\nLombardi (2007) notes that developing authentic learning activities enriches learning and\nthat such activities need not be limited to real-life locations and practice, as authenticity\ncan also be found through the design of blended learning environments, which Yoon and\nLim (2007, 475) describe as \u201ca purposeful mix of delivery media\u201d. The concept of media\nintervention (Bradley, Middleton, and Nunnington 2006) proposes such a mix. Media\nintervention methodology also encourages wider consideration of locally developed digital\nmedia in higher education by reducing the barriers created by technical processes that are\nperceived to be overly complicated (Collis and Moonen 2002). Instead, it encourages\nacademics to view digital media objects as simple resources deployed with the intention of\npromoting active, student-centred learning designed to set challenges, seed ideas, or illus-\ntrate problems so as to quickly engage and affect the learner. Media interventions may be\nrapidly deployed in response to emerging needs, or as student responses to emerging\nknowledge. Their successful deployment, however, is dependent upon ease of production\nand integration.\nMedia intervention can encompass the re-use of existing media objects as well as the\nproduction of new objects by staff, students, technicians, or external suppliers. The value of\nthe media is found in its currency, authenticity, specificity, repeatability and occasionally in\nits constructionist value (Papert 1986; Kafai 1996), rather than in its production value. The\nasynchronous nature of these media objects heightens their potential learning impact by\nletting the student user determine their timely application (Middleton 2008). This results in\ndigital media moving away from transmission and towards conversation (Laurillard 2002).\nIn the age of user-generated grass roots video and podcasting (Horizon Project 2008), digital\nmedia become viable channels in extending the virtual learning environment and, through\nmedia intervention, promote change in the teacher\u2019s role towards that of guide, seeder of\nideas, and motivator.\nIVWs, such as Second Life, allow the user to create props and scenery and, if necessary,\nprogram them with behaviours. Such objects can be small (e.g. buttons on a mobile phone)\nor huge (e.g. office blocks).\nMachinima have been described as \u201canimated filmmaking within a real-time virtual 3D\nenvironment\u201d delivered as digital video (Daly-Swanson 2007). Machinima production first\nemerged in 2001 in the gaming community and has since been featured in film festivals and\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   209\nother public presentations. Films are made by orchestrating and recording avatars and\nobjects in real-time. The avatars, animated 3D representations of people or other beings, are\nmanipulated as virtual puppets (Lowood 2006) by real people through computer interfaces.\nA film with a large cast may therefore require several puppeteers (Nitsche 2005).\nMachinima recording involves screen-capture, with the resultant video footage edited\nusing desktop software. Sound-tracks and effects can also be applied at this stage. Finally\nthe films are exported to a digital video file. Machinima production follows the same\nprocedures, and uses similar techniques, as real-world filmmaking: scenes are story-\nboarded, shot, edited and processed. This can be brief, requiring just one or two people, or\nextensive. Films can be sophisticated productions or, at their simplest, can be rudimentary\nCCTV-type recordings of whatever happened whilst \u2018the camera\u2019 was switched on (Call\n2005).\nIVWs bring the film set and the cast to the producer and this can make it attractive to\neducationalists where a lack of access to budgets, people, locations and time contribute to\nthe inaccessibility of educational video production (Bardzell et al. 2006). For example,\nSecond Life is a widely accessible online environment that supports multi-user engage-\nment. In addition it can be used for free and provides tools to enable the user construction\nof interactive objects. Users can also import images to speed up set development.\nCompared to real-world filmmaking, machinima production is cost-effective, time-\nefficient and offers producers a large amount of creative control (Academy of Machinima\nArts & Sciences website 2005). Machinima and simulation, used together, therefore offer\nfunctionality to academic innovators that until now has been out of reach and so creatively\nunexplored.\nRecent interest in Second Life from educators (Kirriemuir 2007) suggests that although\nIVWs promise many opportunities for synchronous interaction and learning, machinima\nproduction results in objects that have an asynchronous value.\nMachinima can be produced using various 3D environments. However, Bardzell et al.\n(2006), in an evaluation of machinima platforms, conclude that Second Life (as an example\nof their \u2018hybrid games\u2019 category) offers a range of functionality that makes it better suited\nthan either \u2018pure games\u2019 or \u2018pure machinima\u2019 platforms for machinima development.\nGames such as The Sims and The Movies do not offer the freedom to customise sets, props\nand camera angles that can be found in Second Life, and machinima platforms such as\nMoviestorm (http:\/\/www.moviestorm.co.uk), Virtual Stage (http:\/\/www.dakinewave.com\/\nvirtualstage\/index.htm) and Machinimation (http:\/\/www.fountainheadent.com\/n.x\/fe\/\nHome\/Productions\/Machinimation) are promising, though complex or too limited to\nsupport the diversity of educational ideas as discussed here.\nAs IVWs become more familiar to students, they may become widely accepted as\ncreative production spaces for student group work. Filmmaking provides a useful frame-\nwork in which to set a collaborative assignment and, as a learning space, may encourage\nparticipants to apply a range of interpersonal and organisational skills. Its narrative nature\nconnects to emerging interest in educational digital storytelling (Jenkins and Lonsdale\n2007) and other techniques that promote the student voice.\nCarr (2007) describes how the US Navy is capturing simulation activity for review, find-\ning it to be safe and depersonalised and produced \u201cat a fraction of traditional audio\/video\nproduction costs\u201d. The Second Health project (Second Health, website and online machin-\nima at http:\/\/secondhealth.wordpress.com) has created a Second Life presence and a series\nof machinima, allowing service users to experience proposals for London healthcare\nprovision. Machinima production is also used in schools to encourage student autonomy and\nengagement (Czarnecki 2007). Elsewhere large groups are offered diverse experience and\n210  A.J. Middleton and R. Mather\nskill development through the creation of sets, costumes, stunts and special effects that,\notherwise, would not be possible (Joseph 2007).\nMethodology\nThe aim of this ongoing work is to discover whether machinima produced in IVWs can be\nused to engage learners across the higher education curriculum. A concept of machinima\nmedia intervention has been developed and used to underpin this research.\nOutline information about IVWs, machinima and media interventions was included in\nan e-mail invitation to selected academics who were also informed that they had been\nspecifically chosen to contribute on the basis that they had demonstrated an interest in\nacademic innovation in previous work. This enabled the current research to acknowledge\nand build upon prior success strategies employed by those taking part. Together they repre-\nsented a wide range of disciplines.\nSemi-structured interviews with academic participants were carried out to create case\nstudies around a collaborative task of completing a design specification and storyboard for\nthe production of machinima. The interview method may be more usefully described, there-\nfore, as design conversations. This approach was devised to engender a creative attitude\namongst participants and to encourage consideration of the pedagogic opportunities offered\nby media interventions. It was also intended to dissuade participants from dwelling on the\ntechnical barriers, real or imagined.\nSix academics agreed to participate. Some had heard of Second Life, but none had used\nit or were familiar with the machinima or media intervention concepts. The invitation\nexplained that part of the design sessions would include an induction to Second Life, IVWs\nin general, machinima and the media intervention concept.\nThe first 20 minutes in each conversation were used to introduce the various concepts\nand technologies. This was followed by a demonstration of between five and 10 short\nmachinima (Appendix 1), each selected to illustrate facets that could be used to inform the\ndesign process. First, a short machinima with a strong narrative and high cinematic value\nwas shown. This was followed by short YouTube (http:\/\/www.youtube.com) video clips that\ndescribed Second Life, methods of constructing objects, collaborative activity and educa-\ntional applications for IVWs and machinima. Using YouTube clips to introduce concepts\nwas a useful technique and served to demonstrate how media can generate discussion.\nFollowing familiarisation, participants were asked to design a machinima in collabora-\ntion with the authors. Informed and inspired by the induction, design conversations focused\non the completion of a design specification proforma. Discussion of wider issues was also\nencouraged. Each conversation was limited to two hours, which provided a useful design\nconstraint. The academic participant was joined by both authors: one who completed the\nspecification, clarifying the design idea through its documentation; the other responsible for\nencouraging creativity, reviewing understanding of the related concepts used to inform the\ndesign, and ensuring that the conversation covered the intended scope of the research. Data\nwere captured on the proforma and in audio recordings of the conversations. Six common\nthemes emerged from analysis of the full transcripts, as discussed in the results section.\nCase studies\nResults\nAnalysis of transcripts of the design conversations resulted in the identification of six themes.\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   211\nTable 1. Case study descriptions.\n1. Psychology\nModule: Forensic Psychology\nParticipant: Confident user of ICT; enthusiastic about trying new technologies if the \npedagogical benefits are clear; some knowledge of IVWs.\nMachinima idea: A car crash involving two vehicles, seen by two witnesses, one of whom has \nan obstructed view. The crash is shown from various angles, and may \ninclude details and commentaries. More detail is released to students over \ntime, in increasingly longer video clips, as the module progresses.\nApplication: Used in lecture to stimulate thinking and discussion, and to challenge student \nperceptions. Students could be invited to manipulate the scene themselves.\nIntended impact: Perceptions challenged; familiarity with perception theories; theories of \nbystander intervention and eyewitness testimony.\nReusability: Other subject areas (e.g. Criminology, Sociology, Transport Design, Urban \nPlanning, Physics, Engineering).\nOther ideas: Global real estate and architectural projects that cover a range of global \nperspectives, with different people in different locations.\n2. Sport\nModule: Gymnastics, Exercise Prescription\nParticipant: Confident user of ICT; enthusiastic about trying new technologies if the \npedagogical benefits are clear; has innovated with digital media; some \nknowledge of IVWs.\nMachinima idea: Students populate a pre-designed virtual gymnasium with pre-designed \nequipment recording their layouts as short video clips; commentary to \ncapture their reasoning.\nApplication: As a formative assessment.\nIntended impact: Knowledge of how to set up an exercise environment; exploring an environment \nin which they can experiment.\nReusability: Student-submitted machinima added to a library of examples for future use. The \nfitness space and equipment could be used in a number of other ways.\nOther ideas: Setting up a biomechanical experiment; instructional videos of how to use \nequipment with voiceovers in different languages; setting up of fitness \nactivities for specific scenarios, e.g. training elite athletes or rehabilitation \nfrom an injury. Simulating scenarios which might be ethically problematic, \ne.g. interviewing children about obesity; rehabilitation.\n3. Business and Technology\nModule: Computing Foundation Degree\nParticipant: Confident user of ICT; enthusiastic about trying new technologies if the \npedagogical benefits are clear; some awareness of IVWs; innovates in inter-\ndisciplinary teaching and blended learning.\nMachinima idea: An avatar, assuming the role of Managing Director of a major company, gives \na briefing for a group of students.\nApplication: Used in a real-world group assignment briefing supporting an educational \nsimulation. The machinima clip is used as a surrogate Managing Director.\nIntended impact: Professional development.\n212  A.J. Middleton and R. Mather\nTable 1. (Continued).\nReusability: Re-use by replacing avatar voiceovers in the machinima; across disciplines \nwhere insight to boardroom activity is useful.\nOther ideas: Creation of built environments (e.g. an office location), which students have to \nfit out, recording their solutions as machinima. Alternatively the students \ncould be given existing video clips of the space to which they have to add \ncaptions, text descriptions, or voiceover.\n4. Criminology\nModule: Criminal Justice Systems\nParticipant: Enthusiastic about blended learning; basic ICT skills and a little intimidated by \ntechnology and the time it takes to learn new skills.\nMachinima idea: Depiction of a crime, a subsequent arrest, and resultant police interview.\nApplication: A stand-alone video clip describing a common crime and the processes of the \ncriminal justice system (CJS). Eventually replacing lectures by encouraging \nstudent engagement in other ways.\nIntended impact: Knowledge of the CJS; ability to discuss an offender\u2019s journey through the CJS \nin relation to the various agencies; awareness of the strengths and limitations \nof the CJS.\nReusability: Re-use at different levels of study.\nOther ideas: A series representing the whole criminal justice system.\n5. Teacher Education\nModule: PGCE Learning and Skills Sector\nParticipant: Experienced and confident user of ICT; enthusiastic about innovation in \nteaching and learning; some knowledge of virtual worlds including one used \nfor language learning.\nMachinima idea: Classroom behaviour management \u2013 short films of classroom scenarios, \nincluding disruptive students and how to deal with them. A teacher begins a \nlesson by introducing a task. As the students begin to engage, one of them \nbecomes unruly. The machinima would use recordings from real \nclassrooms.\nApplication: In class to promote discussion; as a reference for education students who are \nout on teaching practice.\nIntended impact: Increased confidence and skills in classroom management.\nReusability: Re-use of locations for all levels of teacher education.\nOther ideas: Education policy; modelling of classroom-based research activity.\n6. Microbiology\nModule: Pathogenesis of infectious disease\nParticipant: Experienced in the use of ICT and blended learning; enthusiastic about \nteaching with a wide range of media; some knowledge of virtual worlds.\nMachinima idea: Interaction between cells \u2013 the \u2018battle\u2019 between bacteria with virulence factors \nand the human defence system. This is usually very difficult to visualise.\nApplication: Machinima available in the VLE or used in taught sessions.\nIntended impact: Deeper understanding of the interaction between bacteria and the human \ndefence system.\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   213\n1. Access to the means of production and other benefits of machinima production\nWhen participants were asked why machinima may be more useful than other approaches,\nseveral explained how developing their ideas using real-life footage would require high\nbudgets and access to a crew and locations. In the Business scenario the academic explained\nthat a new office construction could be a fantastic learning resource, but the building\u2019s state\nand site personnel change continuously. This project could become cost-effective by\ndeveloping an IVW simulation and capturing interactions as machinima. Lack of access to\nphysical locations contributed to ruling out video as an option in five cases and in the sixth,\nPsychology, filming a car crash was not feasible. Access to professional production\nfacilities is also problematic for academics and students alike, though many universities are\ndeveloping student-generated media project-based learning initiatives (Bramhall, Radley,\nand Metcalf 2008; Hung, Keppell, and Jong 2004).\nThe Sport academic explained that, \u201cTime is pretty expensive\u201d. This concern was shared\nby others who agreed that finding time to carry out work with traditional media is problem-\natic and that productions involving other people introduce dependencies and inflexibilities.\nVirtual world filming typically requires less crew and cast and can fit alongside other\ncommitments more easily. Time pressures around the use of physical space and equipment\ncan distort the quality of learning and its assessment, according to the Sport tutor who\ndescribed how students are expected to lay out the gym in a specific time slot for an assess-\nment on decision-making about spatial solutions. If they make a mistake they have little\nopportunity to rectify it. In an IVW students can prepare in their own time and produce\ncommented machinima of their decision-making process. It becomes easier for them to try\ndifferent configurations of equipment, identify hazards and optimise their solutions. The\nreal-world activity required unnecessary physical effort, and focused assessment on the\nproduct rather than on the decision-making process, whereas the commented machinima\nwould capture everything.\nFinally, machinima production techniques offer access to tools that allow rapid, rich\nmedia responses. If a set is already established the production of a visual response is within\nthe grasp of both students and academics, and this can be useful in offering visual feedback,\nespecially where digital media-enhanced pedagogies are already used. The Business tutor\nappreciated that student groups would respond differently to the machinima of the Manag-\ning Director\u2019s briefing and noted the potential to generate further machinima in response to\ntheir initial submissions.\n2. Creativity in teaching and learning\nAll six participants readily engaged with the design methodology and enjoyed the opportu-\nnity to work creatively. They demonstrated familiarity with the grammar of film, quickly\naccepting suggestions, and proposing their own. They introduced visual techniques, such as\nmixing real and virtual footage. In the Education case study, for example, the value of a\nTable 1. (Continued).\nReusability: The film could be used for other subject areas, e.g. nursing where there is a \nneed for more basic understanding of microbiology. Some of the modelled \ncomponents (bacteria, cells, etc) could be re-used in other films.\nOther ideas: None. Participant was not keen on the idea of virtual lab machinima.\n214  A.J. Middleton and R. Mather\nreal-world audio track demonstrating classroom disruption mixed with IVW footage was\nseen as useful.\nThe case studies each highlight one of several ideas that were generated quickly. Often\nmany and varied ideas were explored. The conversational approach, anchored to the design\nproforma, was effective in generating and refining ideas.\n3. The application of media intervention methodology\nParticipants readily understood and valued the concept of media intervention, where digital\nmedia is used as a \u201ccatalyst for learning\u201d (Psychology academic), though all thought in\nterms of series, or sets of machinima rather than individual objects. In Microbiology the\nacademic believed machinima \u201cinterspersed in a lecture\u201d would engage and interest\nstudents more than current methods and would be more \u201cstimulating and exciting\u201d.\nClassroom disruption is a difficult topic to address; techniques such as role play often\nfail to capture the chaos. The Education academic felt that media interventions depicting\ndifficult situations could generate empathy and help students to predict such behaviour\nwhilst on placement. They could serve as useful reference points when communicating their\nown placement experience to others and as discussion points in group decision-making. The\nlecturer, recognising the catalytic potential of media said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to look for\nsolutions necessarily within the media itself\u201d.\n4. Models for the generation of educational machinima\nNone of the academics interviewed proposed student-produced machinima ideas without\nprompting. However, once the potential had been introduced, it generally found favour.\nThis response from the Criminology academic was typical: \nThat\u2019s really challenging me now. Well it would be a good test of their learning. It would be a\ngood learning experience, because I\u2019m saying you need to get all those cues in. Well that would\nbe a really, really hard thing for them to do. It would be something I\u2019d have to think about.\nThey\u2019d need to show their learning in terms of, not the technical construction, but in terms of\nhave they really understood what the role of the Crown Prosecution Service is. Well it wouldn\u2019t\njust be through having a Prosecutor and a pile of files there. It would be about showing that\nthey\u2019d made the decision about the evidential test and the public interest test, and that they\nshowed their independence from the police, and they were thinking forward to how the court\nprocess would go. So yes, if they showed that in the machinima then I would say that\u2019s a\ndemonstration of the conceptual knowledge I want them to have as Criminology students. Yes.\nOoh, that\u2019s pushed me a bit!\nThough the research was primarily interested in the generation of ideas, it was inevitable\nthat the practicalities of production would be raised. None of the academics saw it as their\nrole to construct the machinima themselves, leaving three options: \n\u25cf a team of learning technologists;\n\u25cf their own students; and\n\u25cf technical students (e.g. from computing courses).\nSeveral variations emerged for each of these. The basis for engaging students was particu-\nlarly interesting, with options ranging from paid employment or CV recognition for the\nproduction of machinima products, through inter-disciplinary learning collaborations, to\nstudents capturing the process of their own learning in IVWs. In Microbiology, for example,\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   215\nit was suggested that the students could be the content experts briefing an authentic project\nfor Visualisation students and that this would provide a rare opportunity for authentic\ninteraction in the subject with students learning how to articulate ideas to laypeople.\nThe Psychology academic commented that for IVWs to become accessible to all\nstudents as production environments, they would first have to feel \u201cordinary\u201d: \nI don\u2019t want my students to spend a fortnight trying to work out how to use the software and a\nday trying to put the psychology into it.\nThere was some concern that the process might become a distraction and be time consum-\ning. Following a similar experience of working with student producers, one academic noted\nthat the supervision role had been arduous. The Sport lecturer wondered whether all\nstudents would be comfortable operating in such environments, although reflected on other\nstudent-generated media assignments that had worked for him following half-hour induc-\ntion sessions. He thought that a library of student-generated machinima could become\nuseful over time.\nRapid student machinima production (i.e. simple action capture) offered opportunities\nfor Education and Sport where machinima could drive class discussion. On several occa-\nsions it was noted that the design process (e.g. discussion, script-writing, planning), rather\nthan the filming process itself, could provide great value for collaborative learning.\n5. Reusability\nMany of the respondents recognised that the reusability of the virtual film set itself was more\nuseful to them than the resultant machinima. In the Sport case study, for example, there is\nno need for each student to build a gym and its various equipment; their task is to lay out\nand describe the use of the space. In the Microbiology example the lecturer explained: \nOnce you\u2019ve produced a typical bacteria with its virulence factors \u2026 you could cut and paste\ndifferent virulence factors onto the basic organism, and make it slightly different.\nReusability may also be found by offering students machinima stems that they are tasked\nwith completing by introducing variables (e.g. decisions, viewpoints) and conclusions. This\napproach arose in the Criminology, Sport, Psychology and Microbiology discussions.\nIn Sport and Microbiology it was suggested that students could contribute to the creation\nof commented machinima content libraries, adding a degree of authenticity to the assignment,\nwhich could be used by current and future students.\n6. Visualisation and simulation\nVirtual worlds are visually immersive environments capable of supporting independent and\nsocial exploration. Visualisation is a key aspect of all the cases designed in this machinima\nstudy: in offering multiple perspectives of an event; in making records of a plan; through\nobserving artefacts and evidence in an environment; in representing and developing the\ncharacters of protagonists; and in representing concepts visually. In addition, machinima\ncan support the visualisation of relationships, processes and activities, including those that\nare inaccessible to students in the real world.\nThe verisimilitude may be limited, for example in the unrealistic movement of avatars,\nbut all participants still valued the opportunity to visually represent their ideas. In Microbiology\n216  A.J. Middleton and R. Mather\nthe tutor explained, \u201cMicroscopes can only look at living organisms at a very limited\nmagnification of little spots \u2026 very two dimensional and not very interesting at that scale\u201d.\nDiscussion\nAt this early stage the results are encouraging, especially with respect to the attitude of those\nwho took part. Participants demonstrated that they were able to think creatively and\ncinematically, visualising how one shot would follow another. The specification and\nstoryboarding of ideas proved to be a valuable and enjoyable exercise. Participants were\ninitially asked to develop one idea, though often many ideas were generated in the design\nconversations. Even once the topic had been chosen, all participants were keen to keep hold\nof related ideas, noting that once the set has been dressed more use should be made of it.\nDiscussion about simplified production and access initially suggested that educational\nmachinima production may be within the grasp of academic producers, enabling end-user\nindependence and flexibility, though this may be inhibited where ideas are dependent upon\nlarge casts of avatar operators. However, it is disconcerting to note that, even amongst the\nselected innovators, there was clearly a reticence to imagine themselves creating their own\nmachinima, even where the benefits had been enthusiastically discussed. This may be\nbecause they have never considered themselves as media producers before. Nevertheless, it\nindicates that the perceived barriers to such useful technologies are still too high for most.\nInter-disciplinary production, drawing upon and developing different areas of student\nexpertise, was an idea that emerged as a production solution, though again comes with risks\nand an organisational overhead.\n3D visualisation, even when captured in 2D digital films, is an attractive quality of\nmachinima to some academics; finding different viewpoints for an event or experiencing\nmicroscopic phenomena in-the-round cannot be easily achieved by other means.\nThe name Second Life indicates the notion of abstracted life, but the abstraction of\nrendered life in IVWs requires an acceptable degree of verisimilitude and fidelity so that\nusers can make sense of, and believe in, what is happening (Boyle 1997). On the other hand\nAldrich (2005, 81) notes how \u201csimulation elements selectively represent objects or situa-\ntions\u201d, and perhaps this indicates how these IVW media objects should be understood too.\nThis abstraction, and its capture in machinima, appear to be acceptable in the cases\ndiscussed here, but may compromise other applications.\nThe topic of machinima reusability resulted in the focus shifting from reusable films\ntowards reusable film sets, scenery and props. By establishing such material collections in\nthe in-world IVW libraries, the technical and administrative barriers can be lowered: series\nor sets of machinima in related and unrelated disciplines become much more likely if such\nobjects are already available. This priming activity may involve buying in properties, expert\ntechnical contributions, or extra-curricular opportunities for students. Priming approaches\nsuch as these would also help to address perceptions of technical barriers and the need for\nacademics or their students to find time to develop their set and object construction skills.\nThe authors have subsequently developed some of the scenarios described here with a mini-\nmal budget for props. Where it has not been possible to make items, free objects have been\nfound in the Second Life library, images have been uploaded as scenery textures, free items\nhave been found elsewhere, and occasionally items have been purchased from in-world\nstores (e.g. a suit for the Managing Director in Case Study 3). Once acquired, such props\nhave been re-used.\nReusability should be considered with any content production. Machinima are self-\ncontained, highly granular, digital videos and, technically, would appear to be highly reusable.\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   217\nPedagogically their reusability may be limited by over-contextualisation, for example where\ncontent is targeted at a particular subject, educational level (Currier and Campbell 2002) or\nby particular cultural and pedagogical approaches. Designing reusability into any learning\ncontent can be difficult (Collis and Strijker 2004). Machinima objects enable students to view\nthem more than once, store and share them, modify them, and access them on a range of devices.\nThe idea of reusable machinima stems, requiring completion by students, may offer oppor-\ntunities for constructionist pedagogies.\nThe machinima designs developed in this study were intended to be around three\nminutes long, recognising that high-impact objects are more likely to affect learning. Brief\nmedia objects can be valuable informing components in an active learning landscape, whilst\nlonger videos require a different type of learner engagement.\nBeyond the case studies discussed here, there remains potential for other applications.\nFor example, none of the participants proposed the use of machinima as a medium for\nreflective digital storytelling (Jenkins and Lonsdale 2007), though the linear nature of film\nis suited to such student narratives. Machinima could be used to present a visual identity to\na real-world voice, as in the hypothetical case of child testimony that would otherwise not\nbe ethically acceptable.\nConclusion\nThe scenarios considered here suggest that IVW machinima can find value across the\ncurriculum, with many of the benefits being widely applicable. The six themes discussed\nhere are by no means exhaustive; for example, understandings about learning through a\ncaptured, abstracted environment could be developed. The idea of machinima media inter-\nvention was readily accepted, resonating with awareness of other methods of intervention\nto promote student-centred learning. This simple use of media indicates how machinima\nproduction may be technically feasible, though development models for educational\nmachinima are still required and suggest the need for further research.\nReferences\nAcademy of Machinima Arts & Sciences website. 2005.
