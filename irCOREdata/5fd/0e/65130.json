This theme issue of Society and Space contributes to that work of \ntranslation and interpretation. \n \n* * * \n \nThis entire issue of Society and Space is devoted to the work of the German \nphilosopher Peter Sloterdijk. It comprises a number of translations of his work, \nand a series of commissioned essays exploring different aspects of his wide-\nranging thought. Although there is a growing critical literature on his work in \nother languages (for example Dobeneck 2006; Tuinen 2006), and there have \nbeen other English language interrogations in recent years (see Funcke and \nSloterdijk 2005; Royoux and Sloterdijk 2005; Tuinen ed. 2007), and translations \nof essays (2005b, 2006b, 2007b, 2008a), this issue is the most extensive \nAnglophone treatment of his work to date. \n \nSloterdijk was born in 1947, and is currently the Rector of Die Staatliche \nHochschule f\u00fcr Gestaltung in Karlsruhe, Germany where he holds a chair in \n 2 \nphilosophy and aesthetics. He is also a Professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in \nVienna, and the regular co-host of the television show \u2017In the Glasshouse: \nPhilosophical Quartet\u2018, on the German ZDF channel, with R\u00fcdiger Safranski, \nperhaps best known to an Anglophone audience for his biographies of Nietzsche \nand Heidegger. Sloterdijk\u2018s interests are extremely wide-ranging, from aesthetics \nto politics, biology to literature, and philosophy to theology. As well as many \nacademic books he has published a novel, Der Zauberbaum [The Magic Tree] \n(1985) and several volumes of dialogues (for example Sloterdijk and Heinrichs \n2001, Finkielkraut and Sloterdijk 2003, and Sloterdijk and Kasper 2007).  \n \nCritique of Cynical Reason \n \nSloterdijk\u2018s first substantial work was Critique of Cynical Reason, which appeared \nin German in 1983 and was translated into English in 1988. A best-seller against \nthe odds, it catapulted Sloterdijk from obscurity to the centre of the German \nphilosophical debate. Its title is an obvious parody of Kant\u2018s famous critical \nproject, and later appropriations of that mantle such as Sartre\u2018s Critique of \nDialectical Reason. Sloterdijk opposes the all-pervasive modern cynical thought \nthat he diagnoses as a contemporary malaise, to a more originary cynical \nthought. This is the thought of original cynics like Diogenes in Ancient Greece. \nHe calls that model kynicism. This is a model of thought that remains fluid and \nresponsive to life and action, rather than sedimented in systems. Cynicism is, he \nsuggests, merely \u2017enlightened false consciousness\u2018, a state of being that is \nsuperficially well-off but effectively bankrupt and miserable. The book is a tour-\nde-force, intentionally disorganised and playful, yet serious and thought-\nprovoking. Kusters has tellingly likened Sloterdijk\u2018s works to \u2015the stations of the \nLondon Underground; easy to enter, to find your way through, and to exit again, \nbut hard to conceive in groundwork or overall idea\u2016 (2000). Yet one of \nSloterdijk\u2018s key claims was the question of amnesia as a dominant trend in \ncynicism, an issue that was powerfully resonant in post-war Germany. \n 3 \n \nPolitically situated on the left, it was a self-conscious return to some of the \nthematics of a previous generation of German thought, with explicit references to \nboth Nietzsche and Heidegger. These two thinkers were considered intellectually \nsuspect for their political stances, but Sloterdijk, along with many contemporary \nwriters in France, sought to rescue them for rather different purposes. Both \nthinkers, Sloterdijk claimed, were neo-kynics, able to puncture some of the \nintellectual vanities of their time, and still powerfully effective today. Indeed, \nSloterdijk offers a number of provocations in terms of thinking his work as an \nalternative to a Marxist dominated left: \u2015an existential Left, a neokynical Left\u2014I \nrisk the expression: a Heideggerian Left\u2016 (1988a: 209). In a later collection of \ninterviews with Alain Finkielkraut, he described it as a \u2017Nietzschean Left\u2018 (2003: \n23, and Alliez and Sloterdijk 2007: 315-317).  \n \nIn Critique of Cynical Reason, and many other volumes that followed it, Sloterdijk \nresisted the supposedly static analyses of critical theory, offering instead a \nprovocative and political diagnosis of the shifting notions of Western thought and \npractice. Both in German and in translation, Critique of Cynical Reason was \nclosely followed by his book on Nietzsche, Thinker on Stage (1986\/1989a). In \ndistinction to the encyclopaedic ambitions of the Critique, Thinker on Stage \noffered a much narrower focus: a detailed discussion of Nietzsche\u2018s Birth of \nTragedy. From a close reading of this text, however it is clear that Sloterdijk \nundertakes a radical re-reading of Nietzsche\u2018s corpus. Nietzsche becomes a \nmajor event, a \u2017catastrophe\u2018 in German and the European languages. \nParaphrasing Nietzsche, there is philosophy before and after him. Nietzsche\u2018s \ngenius was not merely linguistic, but also philosophical-poetic. Philosophy, \nliterary creation, genre experimentation were unhinged, and new forms of \nthinking were authorized. Sloterdijk\u2018s own philosophical-literary production has \nsought to live after Nietzsche, in the sense of following from him. What has \nbecome an imperative after him is to come to language, in a new way, so as to \n 4 \ncreate a new world, to paraphrase the title of his Sloterdijk\u2018s Frankfurt lectures of \n1988 [1988b]. Sloterdijk shifts the focus of attention from Nietzsche\u2018s late \nwriting, in particular those notes collated in the posthumous The Will to Power, \nto the early texts. At the heart of his re-reading of Nietzsche is the elaboration of \nwhat Sloterdijk calls \u2015Dionysian materialism.\u2016 This materialism is more than a \nmere vitalism, where everything that humans undertake is for the sake of the \nenhancement of life. The Dionysian dimension celebrates that which augments \nlife, but this is a life that is in pursuit of a truth, a truth that is a necessary error. \nThe Dionysian is the excess of the aesthetic and poetic, but one that is linked to \nthe material conditions of possibility of human life. For Nietzsche, art has priority \nto knowledge, for we can die of too much knowledge, while we need art in order \nnot to die of too much truth (Alliez and Sloterdijk 2007: 317). In his 2000 speech \non the occasion of the hundredth anniversary of Nietzsche\u2018s death, Sloterdijk \nreturn to Nietzsche\u2018s stylistic and poetic fecundity, but this time reads him as the \nprophet of the improved gospel, the gospel of the atheist who praises the \naudacity of the being who has had the impudence and lack of prudence to refuse \nto continue being an animal, who sought to become human (2001b). Nietzsche is \nthe prophet of the human yet to come, but whose becoming is a painful but also \njoyous undertaking (see especially sections 7 and 8 of chapter V of Sloterdijk \n1989b). \n  \nEurope and Politics \n \nSloterdijk has often played the role of the enfant terrible of German letters. Not \nonly is he \u2015too French\u2016\u2013as some in Germany accuse him of being as though this \nwere a major sin\u2014but he has on numerous occasions challenged the hold that \nHabermasian critical theory has on German political-cultural life. The Critique of \nCynical Reason, it should be noted, was meant as a \u2017critical theory\u2018 manifesto. \nSloterdijk has declared himself the true inheritor of first generation Frankfurt \nSchool critical theory, that is to say, he sees himself as carrying on the work of \n 5 \nTheodor Adorno, Walter Benjamin, and Ernst Bloch (see Sloterdijk and Heinrichs \n2001). The turn to Nietzsche, of course, is a continuation of an encounter begun \nby Adorno and Horkheimer\u2018s Dialectic of Enlightenment (1972 [1947]), or the \nreading the French Marxist Henri Lefebvre offered of Nietzsche just before World \nWar Two (1939, see 1975). In Eurotaoism, Sloterdijk proclaims that there never \nhas been a Frankfurt Critical theory, while there has been one from Freiburg, the \nplace Husserl and Heidegger spent much of their careers. His Frankfurt lectures, \nfurthermore, announce loudly the need to think with and through literature, and \nto see philosophy as a form of literature, thus directly challenging Habermas\u2018 \nposition on the imperative to keep the genres distinct (1988b; see Habermas \n1987 [1985]). Such direct confrontations exploded in the late 1990s, when \nSloterdijk provoked a debate with his lecture \u2017Rules for the Human Zoo,\u2018 which \nwas given at the Elmau Institute in Germany (1999a). A direct response to \nHeidegger\u2018s Letter on Humanism, Sloterdijk bemoaned the decline of the \ntradition of letter writing as a humanism of dialogue and the advent of a different \nnotion of letter writing, through our DNA. The lecture, which was delivered in a \nsemi-public situation, was meant as a critique of Heidegger\u2018s lingering and covert \nhumanism, notwithstanding the latter\u2018s own avowed critique of it. In a nuanced, \nthough elliptical reading, Sloterdijk placed Heidegger in the humanist tradition of \neducation and self-creation by means of writing. The urge to make ourselves, to \ncreate ourselves, to make of ourselves works of art, was already implicit in the \nRenaissance humanist celebration of creative writing. Heidegger, with his \ncelebration of poets, his idea of philosophy as a form of poesis, and truth as the \nclearing made possible by the poet\u2018s songs to being are but newer elaborations \nof the humanist scribe. Perhaps unwisely, Sloterdijk used a range of charged \nlanguage as he discussed anthropotechnics, including the notion of \u2017Selektion \n[selection]\u2018, which had become closely associated with Nazi eugenics and the \nprocesses in the camps, and that of \u2017Z\u00fcchtung [breeding]\u2018. While Sloterdijk says \nrelatively little about any of these processes, and largely derives his analysis from \ntexts of the tradition, he was deemed to have broken an unspoken taboo on \n 6 \nsuch topics in post-war Germany. Subsequent texts have elaborated in greater \ndetail what he called anthropotechnics, leading to what he calls even more \nprovocatively \u2017a historical and prophetic anthropology\u2018 (see Sloterdijk and \nHeinrichs 2001). The Elmau lecture is now included in a collection of Sloterdijk\u2018s \nwritings (2001a) along with other texts in which he sets out to think with, \nagainst and beyond Heidegger. One of the most controversial aspects of \nSloterdijk\u2018s account was his raising of the question of who should adjudicate on \nsuch ethical decisions concerning gene technology. His call for philosophers and \nscientists to play this kind of role invited the inevitable comparison with Plato\u2018s \nphilosopher-kings and Heidegger\u2018s latter-day attempt to play a similar role in the \npolitical sphere. Yet the interventions of the likes of Mary Warnock and Robert \nWinston in UK policy discussions demonstrate that this need not have quite the \nsame sinister overtones.  \n \nThe ensuing debate between critics and Sloterdijk\u2014including Sloterdijk\u2018s \nnotorious letter to Die Zeit, which accused Habermas of circulating the letter and \nfomenting critical responses\u2014received substantial attention in philosophical \njournals and the wider media, both in Germany and abroad (see Fisher 2000; \nAlliez and Sloterdijk 2007 [originally published in 2000]; Mendieta 2003; 2004). \nYet in English at least, the piece was far more often discussed than read. In fact, \npart of the reason for the German publication was to show the implausibility of \nsome of the interpretations that were being made of it (Alliez and Sloterdijk \n2007: 308). We publish the first English translation in this issue (2009a). In \nrecent years Sloterdijk has returned to this idea of anthropotechnics in a more \nfocused sense of self-fashioning or discipline, trading on unlikely thinkers such as \nWittgenstein rather than the more obvious Michel Foucault for an aesthetics of \nlife changes (2008b; 2009d). \n \nWhile some have referred to Sloterdijk as a \u2017radical neo-conservative\u2018 (Alliez and \nSloterdijk 2007: 308), nothing Sloterdijk has written or said in public could be \n 7 \nconstrued as either an apology or elaboration of \u2017neo-conservatism.\u2018 The few \ncomments on the so-called \u2017war on terror\u2018 in Luftbeben (2002) would be only the \nmost explicit instance of his distance. Sloterdijk is a true child of 68, and has \nremained faithful to that generation\u2018s experimentalism, post-European \nImperialism, post-Pax Americana outlook, and cosmopolitanism. While Nietzsche \nand Heidegger loom large, he is an intellectual magpie, taking inspiration and \nideas from a wide-range of intellectual sources in the German language and \nbeyond, arranging them in new and surprising ways. In addition, Sloterdijk, more \nthan any other German philosopher or intellectual, has made it a point to engage \nnot just with other European intellectuals, but also non-European literary, \nphilosophical and even religious traditions. As a \u2017left-Nietzschean\u2018, Sloterdijk \nconsiders his work as so many \u2017attempts\u2018, \u2017investigations\u2018, \u2017essays\u2018, \u2017trials\u2018, which \nis why many of his books have \u2017Versuche\u2018 or \u2017Untersuchungen\u2018 in their subtitles. \nFor him, philosophers have for too long being sceptical of the world, it is now \ntime to be sceptical of the philosophers\u2018 assumption that they know all that is to \nknow. More important than this philosophical hubris is the Nietzschean inspired \nwillingness to make oneself vulnerable by \u2015trying\u2016 out ideas, by provoking new \nreadings. \n \nAdditionally, it is well known that Sloterdijk undertook a kind of spiritual \npilgrimage to the \u2017East,\u2018 which had profound influences on his thought (see \nSloterdijk and Heinrichs 2001, see also Sloterdijk 1993a). His book Eurotaoism \n(1989b) juxtaposes the kinetic politics of the West to a politics of levity, of the \nsuspension of gravity, of the standing still, slowing down, of Gelassenheit, \nreleasement and letting be. Now, in contrast to the \u2017third-worldism\u2018 of the 68ers, \nSloterdijk is sanguine enough to realize that every glorious past is always the \ninvention of some present for the sake of a future yet to be achieved. The \n\u2017Taoism,\u2018 in the Eurotaoism, is a felicitous projection, invented for the sake of \nestranging ourselves from our lost past. This invented is what is needed, \naccording to Sloterdijk, to arrest the \u2017mobilization of the planet\u2018 (see Sloterdijk \n 8 \n2006c) which plunges us into the desolation that incites a \u2017diabolical Kantianism.\u2018 \nThe imperative of modernity, always more motion, for the sake of motion, has \nunleashed a kinetic politics of acceleration that turns everything into an industrial \nwasteland. Appropriating Ernst J\u00fcnger\u2018s notion of mobilization (from his book Der \nArbeiter [The Worker] (1932), and mixing it with Paul Virilio\u2018s dromology (1986) \nSloterdijk calls for a critique of Europe and Modernity\u2018s catastrophic political \nkinetics. It also brings to mind Heidegger\u2018s reflections on modernity and \ntechnology. It is this same orientation that informs his other two most explicitly \npolitical texts Im Selbe Boot [In the Same Boat] (1993b) and Falls Europa \nerwacht [If Europe Awakes] (1994), which call for a cosmopolitan ecological \nethos of planetary co-existence, and that at the same time challenge Europe\u2018s \nintellectual insouciance (see also Sloterdijk 2005b). Even superficial readings of \nhis most recent works will not fail to note the avowed anti-Eurocentric and anti-\nAmerican tone, which is not motivated by either ressentiment or bad faith, but \nrather by a truly cosmopolitan and terrestrial ethos (Sloterdijk 2005a and 2007a). \nIndeed, Sloterdijk can be said to be articulating the ethos of a post-Imperial \nEurope, a Europe that enters the world and history as one more culture among \nmany others on the terrestrial globe. \n \nSpheres \n \nMany of the essays in this issue focus on Sloterdijk\u2018s recent magnum opus, the \nthree volume book Sph\u00e4ren [Spheres]. Sloterdijk declares that he is engaged in a \nHeideggerian project concerning the nature of being, but not in relation to time, \nas Heidegger himself did (Heidegger 1927\/1962), but in relation to space, which \nthus allows him to describe his own project as the sequel Being and Space \n(1998: 345). Yet, as Heideggerian as Sloterdijk\u2018s spherology may be, it is \ncertainly more than that, for in Sloterdijk we find a re-thinking of Heidegger\u2018s \nown ontological phenomenology. In Sloterdijk\u2018s work, we have an explicit move \nfrom the question of being to the question of being-together\u2014from Sein to Mit-\n 9 \nsein\u2014which concerns both proximity and distance (see Elden 2006). While the \nspatial aspects of Heidegger\u2018s thought have received periodic attention (Franck \n1986; Elden 2001; Schatzki 2007; Malpas 2007), Sloterdijk\u2018s is both the most \ndetached and sustained attempt: detached because it avoids the textual \nreferences to Heidegger\u2018s own thoughts on the subject (though see Sloterdijk \n2001a for a range of essays on Heidegger); sustained because it goes far beyond \nwhat Heidegger himself accomplished on the topic. \n \nSloterdijk recounts how the model came about: \n \nI was also fascinated by a chalkboard drawing Martin Heidegger \nmade around 1960, in a seminar in Switzerland, in order to help \npsychiatrists better understand his ontological theses. As far as I \nknow, this is the only time that Heidegger made use of visual \nmeans to illustrate logical facts; he otherwise rejected such \nantiphilosophical aids. In the drawing, one can see five arrows, \neach of which is rushing toward a single semicircular horizon\u2014a \nmagnificently abstract symbolization of the term Dasein as the \nstate of being cast in the direction of an always-receding world \nhorizon (unfortunately, it\u2018s not known how the psychiatrists reacted \nto it). But I still recall how my antenna began to buzz back then, \nand during the following years a veritable archaeology of spatial \nthought emerged from this impulse (Funcke and Sloterdijk 2005). \n \nOne of the things that is remarkable about Sph\u00e4ren is its insistence, in volume I, \nof the relation between birth and thought. Tracing the relation between the birth \nof a child and that of a world, Sloterdijk is able to put some much needed flesh \non some of Heidegger\u2018s more abstract bones. According to Sloterdijk before \nDasein is in the world, Dasein has to be born. Picking up the theme from Arendt, \nwe all have to come to the world in order to be in it. We are born, but too soon. \n 10 \nWe are the aborted creatures that are thrown into a world that is partly \nestablished and that is partly to be accomplished. Neoteny, for Sloterdijk, is \nanother name for this being aborted, always too early, always too violently. It is \nthis coming into the world, being born to the world, after being thrown and \nripped from the warm amniotic fluid which we breath and feed on that Sloterdijk \nfinds philosophically fecund. For Sloterdijk, therefore, phenomenological analysis \nhas to be preceded by a philosophical gynaecology, or what he calls in the first \nvolume of Sph\u00e4ren, a negative gynaecology (1998: 275) that is an analysis of \nthe process of being ejected from, thrown out of the uterus. We are thus strange \nand estranged (verfremdetet) creatures, who must arrive to a world, but who in \narriving it and already abandoning it. We are creatures of distance\u2014not always \nat home in the world (see 1993a for a lengthy treatment of this dimension of \nneoteny). Still, for Sloterdijk, human existence begins with the unfathomable \npain of being exiled from the maternal womb. We are mangled creatures, who \nsurvive because of the generosity and gratitude of the Other, who welcomes us, \nwho nourishes us, who gives us an abode and refuge. We are born of someone, \nand someone receives us. We are loved and we are lovers. Coming to the world \nis a form of coupling; being-with is a being-with-another which forms a couple. \nBut being born before time means we are always arriving in the world. This \narrival is met with the project of fashioning dwelling. To come to the world is to \nbuild a home. In contrast to Heidegger, for Sloterdijk the Mit-sein is always \nbeing-alongside-others in a dwelling that has been built and in which we are \nenclosed. Being-with is always being inside of a dwelling. Dasein\u2018s neotony and \nalways dwelling alongside another means that the subject is always in a process \nof auto-genesis that is simultaneously a making of worlds. Dasein\u2018s ex-stasis, its \nbeing always ahead of itself, is simultaneously a worlding, a bringing-forth of \nworlds, whether they be poetic, literary, or material and real, such as glass-\nhouses, palaces, or caves. As Sloterdijk put it in an interview: \u2015Bubbles\u2026 is thus \na general theory of the structures that allow couplings. This volume had to be \nwritten in a strange language because I was convinced that no so-called \n 11 \nmaternal language could allow a sufficiently radical discourse on the profound \nrelationship from which we are born\u2016 (Royoux and Sloterdijk 2005: 224). \n \nSloterdijk\u2018s move from the bubbles of Volume I to the globes of Volume II is, as \nhe recognises, scalar (1998: 631), a move from \u2017micro-spherology\u2018 to \u2017macro-\nspherology\u2018, from the negative gynaecology of psychic spaces to the archaeology \nof spatial imaginaries that have informed cultures. In the first volume Sloterdijk \nhas taken phenomenological ontology and returned it to its philosophical \nanthropological roots, but combined it with a psychodynamics of the imaginary. \nIn Sloterdijk\u2018s entire work, in fact, we find an urge to ground what Hans \nBlumenberg called metaphorology in philosophical anthropology (1998 [1960]). \nFor Sloterdijk, in distinction to Blumenberg, this metaphorology is not just pre-\nconceptual, or post-conceptual, it is also visual, iconic. In Sloterdijk\u2018s work we \nfind a continuous play among image, imagination, and imaginary that shuttles \nback and forth between what we experience and see, and what we can imagine \nor cannot imagine because we have not seen an image of what it could be like. \nIt thus entirely logical that the three volumes of Sph\u00e4ren are filled with images \nand reproductions that stand as exemplars and witnesses of many of his key \ngynaecological, phenomenological, and poetic insights. Volume III makes a \nsimilar move from the micro to macro, but seems to disrupt the linkage between \nthe philosophical anthropology and metaphorology when he moves to what he \ncalls \u2017plural-spherology.\u2018 Here Sloterdijk uses the image of foam in order to \nanalyse the interlinked and connective relations between human spheres (it \nshould be noted that foam is a concept that is partly inspired by Deleuze and \nGuattari\u2018s rhizome (see Alliez and Sloterdijk 2007: 322-323)). Foam here means \nthe bubbling of bubbles within a large liquid matrix. The single foam is to the \nlarge soap bubble what the bachelor pad is to the large apartment complex: \nsingular by virtue of forming part of the larger collectivity. It is this simultaneous \nsingularization in the midst of socialization, or collectivization, that Sloterdijk \nseeks to capture in this last volume of this sprawling, exuberant, excessive, \n 12 \nincisive and playful compendium of the spheres and islands we have created to \narrive and sustain to the world. \n \nWe publish two excerpts from this work here. One of these (2009b) concerns the \nradical moment when, in 1915, the atmosphere became a target of modern \nwarfare: the first gas attack on the trenches of World War One. Since that time, \nof course, attack from the air has become a fundamental part of modern \nwarfare, by both state and non-state actors, from bombers, missiles and \nhijackings (see Elden 2009). Sloterdijk\u2018s analysis takes into account other forms \nof attack such as the gas chambers of Nazi Germany and of US judicial \nexecutions. The point of Sloterdijk\u2018s argument is that gas attacks destroy not \nsimply the individual life as much as the possibility of its survival. Attacks on an \nenemy by means of the environment is one of the key inventions of the 20th \ncentury. \u2015The art of killing with the environment is one of the big ideas of \nmodern civilization.\u2016 (Royoux and Sloterdijk 2005: 225) Though this translation is \nan excerpt from Sph\u00e4ren, Sloterdijk had earlier explored these themes in a short \nbook entitled Luftbeben [Airquakes] (2002). The second excerpt from Sph\u00e4ren \n(2009c) concerns issues of cartography and particularly representations of the \nglobe in art. This excerpt is particularly illustrative of the ways in which Sloterdijk \nengages in a kind of Foucauldian archaeology of the psycho-social imaginary of \nthe West. In this selection Sloterdijk tracks the move from the micro- to the \nmacro-spherological by means of the projection of what he calls \u2017metaphysical \nglobes.\u2018 \n \nTowards a Philosophy of Globalisation \n \nIm Weltinnenraum des Kapitals [The Internal World Space of Capital] (2005a) is \nan expansion and rebuttal of the last chapter of Volume 2 of Sph\u00e4ren, titled \u2015The \nLast Sphere.\u2016 There is no last sphere, but attempts at offering monegeism (one \nof those neologisms that Sloterdijk is fond of coining), which means: unilateral, \n 13 \nhomogeneous, controlled and patented representation of the earth under one \nmodel, one picture, one image. Interestingly, just as Sloterdijk invited us to think \nof Sph\u00e4ren as the Being and Space that complements and supplants Heidegger\u2018s \nBeing and Time, Im Weltinnerarum des Kapitals is a complement and \nsupplement to Hegel\u2018s Lectures on World History. The key phrase in this \nSloterdijk manifesto is \u2015Die Philosophie ist ihr Ort in Gedanken gefa\u00dft [Philosophy \nis its place grasped in thought]\u2016 (2005a: 11). How philosophy conceptualizes its \nlocus is what gives rise to the great metanarratives that guided Western \nthinking. In this \u2015philosophical theory of globalization,\u2016 Sloterdijk offers us a \nchronology that distinguishes at least three key epochs of globalization: the \nmetaphysical, initiated by the Greeks with their ontological and theological \nspheres; the terrestrial, also alluded to as imperial and commercial globalization, \nwhich was brought about by Europe\u2018s colonialism and circumnavigation of the \nworld in search of new markets and products; and a third of most recent \ngenesis, the globalization of saturation, brought about by the rapacity of \ncapitalism but also the collapse of space-time leading to the simultaneity and \nproximity of everything and everyone in an almost unblinking present. He \nprovocatively suggests that modern history effectively begins in 1492 and \nstretches to around 1974: from Columbus to Portuguese decolonisation (1999b; \n1994). We are now in a new era of globalisation. But as with most of Sloterdijk\u2018s \nwriting the accuracy or validity of the distinctions made is less important than the \noriginality and profligacy of his exuberant and encyclopaedic readings of the \nintellectual corpus of the last century. \n \nAs should be clear from the preceding discussions, Sloterdijk is fond of taking a \ntheme and providing a rereading of Western history from that perspective. In \nanother recent work, Zorn und Zeit [Anger and Time], for example, he takes the \ntheme of anger or rage as a lens through which to view the European tradition, \nbeginning with Homer\u2018s Iliad and continuing from there (2006a). Again \nparodying a title from the philosophical canon\u2014Heidegger\u2018s Sein und Zeit\u2014\n 14 \nSloterdijk is both playful and serious, with a sustained analysis of theology both \nin terms of human anger and divine wrath. This is in terms of the God of the Old \nTestament, the Catholic church and contemporary Islam. Similar concerns \nsurface in Gottes Eifer [God\u2018s Zeal] (2007a), a book that speaks of the clash of \nthe three great monotheisms. \n \nThe Return of Peter Sloterdijk \n \nFollowing Critique of Cynical Reason it may have appeared for the English reader \nthat Sloterdijk moved off stage. Now, twenty years later, the scene is set for an \neffective \u2017second coming\u2018 of his work. Books are being translated, and his work is \nbeginning to be referenced again, not least by geographers. Within the next \nyear, translations of his books Luftbeben (2009e) and Gottes Eifer (2009f) are \nforthcoming, with future plans for Zorn und Zeit, Im Weltinnenraum des Kapitals \nand, potentially the three volumes of Sph\u00e4ren. Thinkers of the standing of Slavoj \n\u017di\u017eek (2006, 2008) and Bruno Latour (2007) have discussed his work, and at \nleast two international workshops have been devoted to his work, at the Royal \nFlemish Academy of Belgium for Science and Arts in 2007 (see Tuinen and \nHemelsoet eds. 2008), and at the University of Warwick in 2008. Some of the \nspeakers at those workshops have contributed essays to this collection. \n \nThis issue of Society and Space therefore acts as a prelude to some of that work \nof translation, including three important essays, but also continues, and to a \nlarge extent, begins the process of critical interrogation and appropriation in \nEnglish. The essays are contributed by an international and genuinely \ninterdisciplinary group of scholars, from the UK, Belgium, France, Holland, Spain, \nCanada, Switzerland and the USA, and in geography, management, politics, \nsociology and philosophy.  \n \n 15 \nThe key focus of these essays is the book Sph\u00e4ren, unsurprisingly for a journal \nentitled Society and Space. Marie-Eve Morin discusses the politics of Sloterdijk\u2018s \nthinking of spheres and foam, drawing on work on spatiality and interrogating \nthe links with Heidegger. She suggests that Latour\u2018s cosmopolitics offers a \nvaluable corrective to what she calls Sloterdijk\u2018s \u2015rather suffocating account\u2016 of \nthe politics of foam. Ren\u00e9 ten Bos offers a discussion of Sloterdijk from the \nelement of water, suggesting that taking this into account challenges more \nearthbound philosophies of existence and environment, making clear some \npotentially valuable relations to Deleuze\u2018s work along the way. Luis Castro \nNogueira brings Sloterdijk into productive tension with some of his own writings \non wrappings and folds, discussing the ways in which ideas of bubbles, globes \nand foam relate to notions of social space-time. The key question is what extent \nhis work remains stuck within Western metaphysical conceptions. In a not \nunrelated move, Nigel Thrift uses Sloterdijk as the basis for a discussion of the \nquestion of logographism \u2013 the depiction of characters and spaces of thought. \nFor Thrift Sloterdijk offers a brilliant but flawed diagnosis, and he therefore turns \nto discussions of Chinese writing and architecture to open up other possibilities \nto Western thought. Sjoerd van Tuinen interrogates the ethico-aesthetic \nparadigm he suggests can be found in Sloterdijk\u2018s work, looking at the relation \nbetween anthropology and ecology. While all of these essays use Sph\u00e4ren as \ntheir key focus, each departs from that text to bring their themes into dialogue \nwith other thinkers and texts.  \n \nKeith Ansell-Pearson offers a rather different essay, bringing his own \nconsiderable accomplishments as Nietzsche interpreter to bear on Thinker on \nStage, interrogating the basis of Sloterdijk\u2018s account but using this as the \ngroundwork for a wider discussion of the question of the human today. Jean-\nPierre Couture offers a review essay of Sph\u00e4ren and, finally, Francisco Klauser \nand Miguel de Beistegui round off the issue with two reviews of Zorn und Zeit. \n \n 16 \nTogether the essays in this issue contribute to the process of bringing this \nimportant, difficult and contentious thinker into constructive dialogue with a \nrange of themes that are part of the European mainstream. We look forward to \nfuture submissions utilising, critiquing and developing his work. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nWe would like to thank all of our contributors and translators for their \nenthusiasm and hard work; Jan Schubert for her careful editorial eye and \npatience; and Nigel Thrift for his comments on this introduction and exemplary \nwork on the issue as a whole. \n \nReferences \n \nAdorno, T. and Horkheimer, M. 1972 [1947] Dialectic of Enlightenment, \ntranslated by J.
