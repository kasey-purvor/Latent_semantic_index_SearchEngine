It\nwas shown that polymer morphology and recognition properties are affected by the\nmagnetic field leading to considerable improvements in the performance of newly\nsynthesised materials. Apparently the magnetic field improved the ordering of the\npolymer structure and facilitated the formation of more uniform imprinting sites.\nIntroduction\nThe effect of magnetic field (MF) on the physical and chemical properties of\npolymers has been under intense investigation (Chiriac and Simionescu, 2000; Chiriac\net al., 2000). Polymers synthesised in the presence of a magnetic field often exhibit\ndifferent properties and polymerisation kinetics when compared to polymers\nsynthesised by traditional procedures (Chiriac et al., 2000). Even weak MF influences\nchemical kinetics and changes the activation energy and entropy for a chemical\n2reaction, especially for polar compounds with high diamagnetic susceptibility (Chiriac\nand Simionescu, 2000; Dibiendu and Maiti, 1998; Vedeneev et al., 1990). Magnetic\nfield effects on the rate of reactions are observed if electronic states with different\nmagnetic properties are involved in a rate determining step. These include singlet and\ntriplet states of initiator radicals (Chiriac and Simionescu, 2000; Chiriac et al., 2000).\nMagnetic field tends to favour singlet-triplet transitions on the radical pairs and due to\nenergetic reasons, radicals in the triplet state are less prone to geminate\nrecombination. As a result, initiation efficiency, reaction rate and yield are improved\ndue to the longer lifetime of radicals and a reduction of the cage effect (Chiriac and\nSimionescu, 2000; Chiriac et al., 2000). The catalytic effect of the MF can also be due\nto distortions of the molecules, increased interactions and modification of angles\nbetween bonds (Chiriac and Simionescu, 2000; Chiriac et al., 2000).\nOther MF effects include magnetic orientation and concentration, e.g. aligning\nthe molecules and polymer chains. Polymers obtained within a MF present improved\nthermal stability and lower swelling due to their ordered structure (Chiriac and\nSimionescu, 2000; Chiriac et al., 2000). For this reason a MF has previously been\nused to prepare epoxy resins with enhanced properties and to align liquid crystals\n(Benicewicz et al., 1998; Brostow et al., 1999; Shimoda et al., 1997; Wang and\nHuang, 2000). Other uses include the preparation of macromolecular compounds with\nvery low conductivity, high transparencies, low elasticity moduli, chemically tuneable\nproperties and good processability (Chiriac et al., 2000).\nHere we present the first attempt to apply a magnetic field to improve the\nperformance of molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs). We have seen from our\nprevious work that physical factors which affect the polymerisation process, such as\ntemperature, pressure and polymerisation time affect both the morphology of\n3polymers and their recognition properties (Piletsky et al., 2002; Piletsky et al., 2004;\nPiletsky et al., 2005). In general the decrease in system entropy leads to the\nimprovement in polymer recognition properties. It was expected that an applied MF\nwould enhance the ordering of the structure of synthesised polymer and improve the\nuniformity of the population of its binding sites.\nThe model system used to study the influence of a MF on MIPs included a set\nof hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) based polymers imprinted with (-)-ephedrine.\nThe polymerisation process was performed in the presence and in the absence of\nconstant magnetic field of different intensities and the resulting polymers were\ncharacterised by X-ray diffraction, FTIR, HPLC, surface, porosity and swelling\nanalysis.\nMaterials and methods\nChemicals. (1R,2S)-Ephedrine [(-)-ephedrine] and (2R,1S)-ephedrine [(+)-\nephedrine], ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, 1,1\u2019-\nazobis(cyclohexanecarbonitrile), hexamethylenediamine (HMDA) and chloroform\nwere purchased from Aldrich, UK. All chemicals and solvents were of analytical or\nHPLC grade and used without further purification.\nPreparation of molecularly imprinted polymers. Polymer composition was\nreported elswere11. To a solution of (+)-ephedrine (1.21 mmol, 0.2 g) in chloroform\n(8.82 g) was added 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (12.1 mmol, 1.57 g), ethylene glycol\ndimethacrylate (35.9 mmol, 7.1 g) and 1,1\u2019-azobis (cyclohexanecarbonitrile) (0.18 g).\nThe monomer mixture was placed into a 20 mL glass tube, purged with nitrogen for 5\nmin and sealed. The glass tube with polymerisation mixture was then placed in a\nhomogeneous magnetic field with intensities ranging from 0 to 1.55T at 20 mm from\n4the electromagnet poles. The electromagnet used consisted of two poles embedded in\ntwo magnetic coils, cooled by water and produced by Tochelectropribor, Ukraine. The\nmagnetic field was stabilised by a current source with a relative instability of 0.05%\nand polymerised under UV radiation for 15 minutes with a mercury quartz lamp of\nultrahigh pressure with 120 W, (SVD, Russia). Blank polymer was prepared in the\nsame way but in the absence of template. The bulk polymers were ground in\nmethanol and wet-sieved through 106-25 \u03bcm sieves (Endecotts, UK) and sedimented\nin methanol to remove fines. The polymers were additionally washed with\nchloroform containing 0.05% HMDA. Spectrophotometric analyses of ephedrine\nconcentration in washing solutions, performed at 260 nm indicated that 94-95% of the\ntemplate was removed successfully from the polymer. Polymer particles were dried\nunder vacuum and used to pack HPLC columns.\nSurface area. The determinations of specific surface areas were performed\nusing a NOVA 1000 E Series Gas Sorption Analyser (Quantachrome), based on the\nnitrogen BET. All reported data represent the results of 3-5 concordant experiments,\nwith standard deviation below 5%.\nX-ray diffractometry. The semi-transparent polymer was studied by X-ray\ndiffractometry. X-ray diffractometry was performed using a DRON-3M (Burevestnik,\nRussia), with Cu K\uf061 radiation. The x-ray scattering intensity as a function of the\ndiffraction angle \uf051 was determined in directions parallel and perpendicular to the\nmagnetic field force lines in the specimens. Peaks were calculated according to the\nformula:\n2d sin\u0398=n\u03bb                                                                                                       (1) \nwhere d is the interplane distance, \u0398 the angle of scattering and \u03bb the wavelength \n(0.154 nm for Cu K\uf061 ). Mean orientation factors (k) were calculated as the ratio\n5between intensity of crystalline maximums for samples treated in magnetic field and\nuntreated analogues. All reported crystallographic data represent the results of 3-5\nconcordant experiments, with standard deviation below 5%.\nHPLC analyses. For the analysis of MIP recognition properties, the polymer\nparticles were suspended in methanol and packed in stainless steel HPLC columns (10\nmm \u00d7 4.6 mm) at 1000 bar pressure using 1666 HPLC column Slurry Packer model\n1666 (Alltech, UK). The evaluation experiments were carried out using an Agilent\nHPLC system (USA). Columns were washed with 0.05% hexamethylenediamine in\nchloroform at a constant flow (1 mL min-1) until a stable baseline was achieved.\nHPLC analysis was performed at a flow-rate of 1.0 mL min-1 and monitored by an UV\ndetector at 260 nm. Injection amounts were 20\u03bcl of a 1 mg mL-1 sample. The\nretention of ephedrine enantiomers was examined at 20 \u00baC. Acetone was employed as\na void marker. Capacity factors (K') were determined from\nK'= (t - to)\/to (2)\nwhere t is the retention time of a given species and to is the retention time of the void\nmarker (acetone). Effective enantioseparation factors (\u03b1) were calculated from the\nrelationship:\n\u03b1= K'(+)\/K'(-) (3)\nwhere K'(+) and K'(-) are the capacity factors of the (+)- and (-)-ephedrine,\nrespectively. All reported chromatographic data represent the results of 3-5\nconcordant experiments.\nFrontal chromatograpy. Varying concentrations of (-)-ephedrine\n(A0 = 0.025-16 mM) were injected onto a 100\u00d74.6 mm HPLC column packed with\npolymer. The eluent was 0.05% hexamethylenediamine in chloroform at a constant\nflow of 1 mL min-1. The results were plotted as follows: 1\/{[A0]\/(V-V0)} versus\n61\/[A0], where V and V0 are the elution volume of (-)-ephedrine and the void marker\n(acetone). The number of binding sites was calculated from the intercept on the\nordinate (1\/Bt) and the dissociation constant from the intercept on the ordinate\n(-1\/Kdiss) 19. All reported frontal chromatography data represent the results of 3-5\nconcordant experiments. The standard deviation of the measurements was below 5%.\nIR Spectroscopy. The FT-IR spectra were recorded using Thermo Nicolet\nAvatar 370 FT-IR (USA) in absorbance mode between 1630 and 1680 cm-1, and the\nnet area was normalized against a net reference with integration limits between 990\nand 920 cm-1 (Piletsky et al., 2005).\nSwelling Analysis. Swelling experiments were performed as described\npreviously )Piletsky et al., 2002). Three hundred milligrams of the polymer particles\nwith the mesh size 25-106 \u03bcm were packed in 1 mL solid-phase extraction cartridges\n(Supelco, UK). Cartridges were filled with 1 mL of chloroform. After 6 h\nequilibration at 20 C, the excess of solvent was removed from the polymer by\napplying reduced pressure for 1 min and the weight of the swollen polymer was\nmeasured. The swelling ratio (Sr) of the polymers was calculated from the following\nequation:\nSr = (ms-m0\/m0) (4)\nWhere ms is the mass of the swollen polymer and mo is the mass of dry polymer.\nResults and discussion\nTo analyse the effect of a continuous external magnetic field on the\nperformance of imprinted polymers, monomer mixture was placed between two\nelectromagnets and polymerised with UV radiation under seven different magnetic\nfield intensities (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 1.2, 1.55 T) for 15 minutes. It should be noted\n7however that such short polymerisation time is not ideal for the preparation of MIPs\n(Piletsky et al., 2005), but due to technical limitations it was difficult to sustain high\nmagnetic field intensities for a longer period of time. The results are only intended to\nbe a demonstration of the influence of continuous magnetic field applied during the\npolymerisation of MIPs. The effect of MF on the fine structure of the polymer was\nanalysed by X-ray diffractometry. The X-ray scattering of polymer samples as a\nfunction of the diffraction angle \uf051 was determined in directions parallel and\nperpendicular to the magnetic field force lines in the specimens. Figure 1 represents\nthe x-ray scattering intensity as a function of the diffraction angle \uf051 determined in\ndirections perpendicular and parallel to the magnetic field force lines in the specimens\n(MIP 1.55T). In the direction perpendicular to the force lines there are two crystal\nmaxima with d1 = 2,85 nm and d2 = 2,15 nm (Figure 1a). At larger angles it is\npossible to see a large feebly marked amorphous halo, characteristic for this type of\npolymer (Figure 1b). The diffraction curve of the same samples, received in a\ndirection parallel to the direction of magnetic field force lines in the specimens, shows\nthe same maxima are poorly distinguished from the background (Figure 1c). The\ndiffraction curve of a sample, polymerised in the absence of magnetic field has only\none crystal reflex with d = 2,85 nm and a week shoulder conforming to the second\nreflex (Figure 2). The diffraction curves for both MIP and blank polymers were\npractically identical (data not shown).\nAlthough it is difficult to assign these peaks precisely to the corresponding\nstructural elements, it is believed that these maximums correspond to the repetition\ndistance along the packed polymer chains (Plate et al., 1980). The results indicate that\nthe magnetic field induced a certain degree of orientation in the polymer, and\nmaterials prepared at higher MF intensities possess a higher mean orientation factor\n8(Figure 3). Orientation in the magnetic field is caused by the anisotropy of a\ndiamagnetic susceptibility of the growing macromolecules and crystallites. As a\nconsequence, the structure formed in the presence of a MF differs from the one\ngenerated in its absence.\nAs previously mentioned, the MF can also exert a catalytic effect on\npolymerisation reactions (Benicewitz et al., 1998). Then, it would be reasonable to\nassume that with increased MF intensity, less pendant vinyl groups remained on the\npolymer. This was confirmed by infrared spectroscopy, a technique commonly used\nfor fine quantification of functional groups during chemical reactions (Piletsky et al.,\n2005; Vernooij et al., 2002; Mosn\u00e1\u010dek et al., 2004; Duffy et al., 2001; Burcham et al.,\n2001; Guilde et al., 2001). The degree of cross-linking (normalised area of the C=C\nstretching peak) for polymer synthesised at 1.55T is approximately 45% smaller than\nthat of polymers synthesised without the influence of MF, Figure 4 and Table 1. This\nconfirms that more double bonds became saturated when a MF is applied during\npolymerisation. Due to the effect of the MF on macromolecular chains, termination by\nrecombination is favoured instead of disproportionation (Chiriac et al., 2000). This\nallows a more efficient use of generated radicals and leads to higher level of cross\nlinking. Together with the ordered structure, these differences affected polymer\nmorphology and produced more rigid materials, as confirmed by measuring polymer\nswelling in chloroform (Table 1). The surface areas for the polymers were calculated\nby the nitrogen BET (Piletsky et al., 2005). Results indicate a decrease in surface area\nwith increasing MF intensities (Table 1). Polymers prepared under the influence of\nMF appear to be more homogeneous gel-like materials with low surface area and\nreduced swelling (Table 1).\n9To analyse the influence of the MF on MIP recognition properties, the\nsynthesised materials were packed in chromatographic columns and tested using\nHPLC, as described previously (Piletsky et al., 2002), for their ability to discriminate\nbetween (+)- and (-)-ephedrine (template). The result of this testing performed in\nchloroform with 0.05% HMDA is presented in Table 1.\nThere was a clear effect of the MF on the performance of the imprinted\npolymers, with a clear increase in separation factors (\u03b1) (see Figure 5 and Table 1).\nThe highest \u03b1 was obtained when polymer was prepared with a MF of 0.4T.\nSubsequent increases in MF intensity actually resulted in a decrease of \u03b1, although\npolymers still displayed a separation factor superior to those prepared in the absence\nof MF. This can be attributed to the \u201cstretching\u201d effect of the MF force lines on the\ngrowing polymer chains, which interfered with the tri-dimensional arrangement of\nmonomers around the template. In this way, for materials synthesised at higher MF\nintensities, this effect can overcome the benefits resulting from the structural ordering\ninduced by the magnetic field. Blank polymers (prepared without template but under\nthe influence of MF) were unable to discriminate between (+) and (-)-ephedrine (data\nnot shown). The shape of the peaks on the HPLC chromatograms was also improved\n(Figure 6), with an asymmetry factor of 3.00\u00b11.3% (MIP prepared with a MF of 0.4T)\nas compared to 6.25\u00b14.8% of polymer prepared in the absence of MF. Asymmetry\nfactors higher than 1 indicate a tailing peak (Majors and Carr, 2001). The\nimprovement in asymmetry factor by a factor of 2, as a result of an applied MF,\nindicates a fundamental change which could improve the chances for practical\napplication of the MIPs developed.\nThis improvement can be attributed to the creation of more ordered and rigid\nstructure of the polymers as a result of the application of a MF. The improvement in\n10\nenantioseparation, together with the improvement of peak shape, serve as an\nindication of the creation in the polymer of a population of more uniform binding\nsites. The detailed testing of the quantity and quality of accessible binding sites was\nperformed by frontal chromatograpy (Andersson et al., 1996). For this study we\nselected the MIP with the higher separation factor (MIP 0.4T) and control polymer\nsynthesised without MF. Template concentrations ranged from 16 mM (90%\nsaturation) down to 0.025 mM. Results indicate a considerable increase in the\nuniformity of the binding site population for polymer prepared under 0.4T MF, when\ncompared with polymers made at 0T. The Scatchard plot for MIP 0.4T (Figure 7a)\nindicates that there is an apparent uniform population of high-affinity binding sites\n(Kdiss of 67.90 \u03bcM) for a broad range of template concentrations (0.025 to 1 mM).\nThere is also a second population of low affinity binding sites (Kdiss of 1.79 mM) for\ntemplate concentrations ranging from 2 to 16 mM. Although the dissociation\nconstant for MIP prepared at 0T is lower (Kdiss of 43.30 \u03bcM), its linear range is much\nreduced (0.025 to 0.2 mM), see Figure 7b. In addition there are two other discrete\npopulations of low affinity binding sites (Kdiss of 0.26 mM for template concentrations\nranging from 0.3 to 1 mM) and Kdiss of 1.07 mM for the concentration range 2 to 16\nmM, Figure 7b and 7c. The number of high affinity binding sites (Bh) for the\nimprinted polymer prepared at 0.4T is 1.7 times higher (8.47 \u03bcMol\/g) than that of\nMIP 0T (4.96 \u03bcMol\/g). Remaining lower affinity binding sites for MIP 0.4T are 22.66\n\u03bcMol\/g; for MIP 0T the numbers are 12.19 \u03bcMol\/g (Kdiss 0.26 mM) and 1.44 \u03bcMol\/g\n(Kdiss 1.07 mM). For blank polymer synthesised under 0.4T MF the Kdiss and total\nnumber of binding sites Bt are, respectively 8.95mM and 0.019mM\/g.\nConclusion\n11\nWe have shown that the magnetic field plays an important role in determining\nthe morphology and performance of synthesised imprinted polymers. A continuous\nexternal magnetic field applied during polymerisation created more rigid and ordered\npolymer with a higher level of cross-linking. This effect was responsible for\nsubstantial improvement in polymer performance in enantioseparation. Additionally,\nthe high heterogeneity of the population of binding sites, a common problem affecting\nMIPs, was also reduced when polymers were prepared under the influence of\nmagnetic field. This technique can be used in the future as a generic method to\nimprove the recognition properties of imprinted polymers.\nAcknowledgement\nSP would like to acknowledge Royal Society - Wolfson Research Merit Award\nCaption to figures\nTable1.
