This paper proposes an approach for the optimisation of web\nbusiness processes using multi-objective evolutionary computing. Business\nprocess optimisation is considered as the problem of constructing feasible\nbusiness process designs with optimum attribute values such as duration and\ncost. This optimisation framework involves the application of a series of\nEvolutionary Multi-objective Optimisation Algorithms (EMOAs) in an attempt\nto generate a series of diverse optimised business process designs for given\nrequirements. The optimisation framework is tested to validate the framework\u2019s\ncapability in capturing, composing and optimising business process designs\nconstituted of web services. The results from the web business process\noptimisation scenario, featured in this paper, demonstrate that the framework\ncan identify business process designs with optimised attribute values.\nKeywords: Multi-objective optimisation, Business Process, EMOA, Web\nservices\n1 Introduction\nThe design and management of business processes is a key factor for companies to\neffectively compete in today\u2019s volatile business environment. By focusing on the\noptimisation and continuous improvement of business processes, organisations can\nestablish a solid competitive advantage by reducing cost, improving quality and\nefficiency, and enabling adaptation to changing requirements. This paper discusses\nhow a business process optimisation framework (bpoF), based on Evolutionary Multi-\nobjective Optimisation Algorithms (EMOAs), can be applied to the real-world\noptimisation of actual web business processes. The details of bpoF are presented in\n[1]. The proposed optimisation framework is tested with a web business process\nscenario to validate the framework\u2019s capability in capturing, composing and\noptimising process designs constituted of web services.\nAccording to Davenport and Short [2] a business process is a set of logically\nrelated tasks performed to achieve a defined business outcome. A business process is\nperceived as a collective set of tasks that when properly connected perform a business\noperation. A web business process is therefore a process composed of web services,\nwhere the function each process task performs is enacted by an individual web\nservice. A web service can be thought of as \u2018a discretely defined set of contiguous and\nautonomous business or technical functionality implemented over a network\u2019 [1]. A\nfurther discussion of the literature for business process optimisation can be found in\n[3]. There are limited approaches for optimising business processes. Such approaches\ncan only deal with simple sequential business processes within a single objective\noptimisation framework [4]. The work of Ko et al. [5] highlights a number of\nexamples of soft computing use in the business process arena.\n2 Quantitative Representation of Business Process Designs\nThe business process optimisation framework (bpoF), applied here, is described in\ndetail in [1]. The main elements involved are the tasks and resources of the business\nprocess. The attributes of the tasks and the process are also taken into consideration in\norder to provide the capability of evaluating a business process design. Finally, the\npatterns that interconnect the tasks are also included. As task attributes, we consider\nmeasurable (quantitative) characteristics of the tasks. Examples involve task cost and\ntask duration. The task attributes can be mapped to the corresponding process\nattributes (e.g. process cost) using a suitable aggregate function. We consider the\ninputs and outputs of a task as task resources. The task resources connect the various\ntasks based on their inputs and outputs. Also, the resources provide the requirements\nfor a process design in the form of required process input and process output.\nThe chromosome of each individual is made up of task numbers which are then\norganised into a specific sequence by the Process Composition Algorithm (PCA). It is\nthe PCA that creates the process graphs out of the tasks provided in an individual.\nBoth crossover and mutation operators are used in the manipulation of individuals.\nThe task library can be used to help repair an individual by the addition of extra tasks\nas that individual is built into a process by the PCA. The general parameter settings\nfor the EMOAs used are shown in Table 1. The main steps of the proposed business\nprocess optimisation framework are detailed in [6].\n3 Web Business Process Optimisation\nThe scenario featured in this paper describes an automated sales forecasting process\n(scenario provided by [7]). This process is considered as semi-automated as it\ninvolves the interaction of some applications but it is not streamlined and still requires\nhuman involvement in the act of generating and visualising the requested forecasts. In\nthis process each of the tasks (marked 1- 5 in Fig. 1) is a web service carrying out a\nunique function, such as generating graphs etc. The aim of this scenario is to show the\noptimisation potential of the framework. Fig. 1 shows the generic business process\ndesign for the scenario. It involves two input resources: (a) company name and (b)\nmarket update request. The first resource is necessary for the web service to extract\nrelevant data for the specified company. The second resource is a request for a market\nupdate that needs to be considered for the sales forecast.\n3.1 Library of tasks (web services)\nHaving sketched the initial business process design, we can compile the library of\nalternative web services based on the main steps of the generic process design.\nTable 1. General parameters\nFig. 1. Initial business process design for sales forecasting\nRelevant research on the selected on-line libraries of web services resulted in a\nselection of 20 web services from different providers that can potentially contribute to\nimplementing the scenario (an example table of web services can be found in [1] p.\n213). Each task in the scenario has input and output resources (an example of the\ntable of resources can be found in [1] p. 212). The proposed optimisation framework\nis tested for two objectives; Service Delivery Price (SDP) (specifies the amount of\nmoney the service customer has to pay for the consumption of distinct service\nvolumes, i.e. the cost to use the service) and Service Fulfilment Target (SFT)\n(specifies the service provider\u2019s promise of effective and seamless delivery of the\ndefined benefits to any authorised service consumer). SFT is expressed as the\npromised maximum number of successful individual service deliveries with respect to\nthe total counts of individual service deliveries.\nHaving gathered all the necessary information (library of web services and\ninput\/output resources for each web service), the problem parameters can be defined\nbased on the business process problem formulation (an example of parameter values\ncan be found in [6]). This results in a complete scenario ready to be tested within the\nproposed optimisation framework.\n3.2 Generate the scenario\u2019s search space\nThe first step towards visualising the results is to generate the scenario\u2019s search space\nby producing 1000 random feasible process designs. The initial business process\ndesign in Fig. 1 involves 5 main steps. A design with less than 5 tasks shows that\nthere is a web service that consolidates two or more tasks. A design with more tasks\nshows that one step requires two or more web services to be implemented. The search\nspace for this scenario is shown in Fig. 2. The search space consists of five different\nregions, each corresponding to a group of designs with same number of tasks (4, 5, 6,\n7 or 8).\n(1)\nRetrieve business\nfinancial information\n(2)\nUpdate on\nmarket news\n(3)\nCreate sales forecast\n(4)\nGenerate graph(s)\n(5)\nObtain Results\nprocess\nINPUT(S)\nprocess\nOUTPUT(S)\n(a)\nCompany name\n(b)\nMarket update\nrequest\n(a)\nResults\nreport\nPopulation 250\nGenerations 25,000\nCrossover\nprobability\n0.8\nMutation\nprobability\n0.2\nObjectives 2\n3.3 Test the scenario with bpoF\nThe challenge for the EMOAs in the framework is to identify non-dominated\n(optimised) solutions in each of the regions in the search space. Fig. 2 shows the\nresults obtained by combining the outputs of four EMOA algorithms (the four\nalgorithms used were NSGA2 (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm 2), PAES\n(Pareto Archived Evolutionary Strategy), PESA2 (Pareto Envelope-based Selection\nAlgorithm 2) and SPEA2 (Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2)). All the\nalgorithms identify process designs near the Pareto front of each of the five regions of\nthe search space. This is a strong indicator of the performance of the algorithms and\nthe confidence in the generated designs being near optimal. Fig. 2 demonstrates two\noptimised business process designs (a) and (b), one with 4 tasks and one with 6 tasks\n(taken from the Pareto fronts indicated in Fig. 2). Each of these designs belongs to a\ndifferent island based on its size. The arrows in Fig. 2 indicate the island from where\neach design in Fig. 3 originates. Fig.3. (a) shows a business process design with one\nof the generic steps missing. The forecasting results are not plotted into a graph but\nthey are just faxed back to the requestor. The framework reduces cost in this instance.\nTherefore, in a semi-automated process the framework can take \u2018initiative\u2019 and alter\nthe generic design provided that the process input and output requirements are still\nsatisfied. Fig. 3(b) is composed of 6 services and involves two tasks for obtaining the\ncompany\u2019s financial data either from selecting one or both (OR is not exclusive\nchoice). This provides better confidence in terms of accuracy of the data obtained and\nimproved reliability of the process execution itself.\nFig. 2. Search space and EMOA results for the scenario\n4 Conclusions\nThe scenario featured in this paper demonstrated how an optimised business process\ncan be automatically created by the optimisation framework using web services. The\nframework identified the optimal designs for all the available process sizes. The\ngenerated designs select and incorporate different web services arranged with the\n(a)\n(b)\nSDP\nSFT\nappropriate process patterns so that (i) the process input and output requirements are\nsatisfied and (ii) the attribute values are optimised. Results from the real-life scenario,\nfeatured in this paper, demonstrate that the optimisation framework can identify\nbusiness process designs with optimised attribute values.\nFig. 3.
