Introduction \n \nDespite a burgeoning literature on decentralization and conflict, there has been \nno consensus among political economists about the relationship between these two \nphenomena.  Bardhan (2005: 105), for instance, has suggested that decentralization \nmay be a way to \u2018diffuse social and political tensions and ensure local cultural and \npolitical autonomy.\u2019  However, Brancati (2006) argues that, while decentralization \nmay increase political participation, it may also encourage a growth in regional and \nethnic political parties, and thereby lead to more conflict rather than less.  Treisman \n(2007) differs again, arguing that generalizing about the relationship between \ndecentralization and conflict is impossible. \nThis debate has largely been conducted about how and what functions of \ngovernment should be decentralized to the local level in order to alleviate conflict.  \nThere has been little discussion, however, about two key aspects of decentralization: \nfirst, to which levels of local government power should be decentralized, and second, \non what basis new decentralized political units should be created.  In the first instance \nthis topic is especially important to countries like Uganda which have a large number \nof layers of local government similar in structure.  Unlike countries like the U.S., \nIndia or Nigeria with federal systems, where states are vastly different in design from \nvillage-level local governments, Uganda\u2019s decentralization program has been well \ndesigned to diffuse power across different levels of local government.  Yet there has \nbeen precious little analysis of the nature of decentralization on local-level conflict \nacross these levels.  In the second case, countries like Nigeria and Uganda have seen \nan explosion in the number of federal states and districts, respectively, as a means to \nbuild up patrimonial support among local elites without any concomitant research into \nwhat effect this process has had on local- and national-level conflict. \nThus I investigate here the case of Uganda, where President Yoweri Museveni \nand his National Resistance Movement (NRM) government embarked on a radical \ndecentralization programme upon coming into power in 1986.  Uganda\u2019s \ndecentralization program has drawn large amounts of praise from donors and scholars \nalike; Francis and James (2003: 325), for instance, have called it \u2018one of the most far-\nreaching local government reform programs in the developing world.\u2019  Yet I argue \nhere that Uganda\u2019s decentralization programme, while helping to reduce national-\nlevel conflict, has nonetheless replaced it with local-level conflict.  This process has \ntaken place in two ways.  First, the concentration of local power at the district level \nrather than its diffusion across all five levels of local government has led to struggles \nover district leadership positions.  Second, the huge expansion in the number of new \ndistricts has led to local-level conflicts in both the fight to create new districts and the \nway district creation has empowered local extremists. \nThis paper is structured as follows.  First, I give an overview of \ndecentralization in Uganda.  Second, I examine the role of both the concentration of \npower at the district level as well as the increasing number of districts in Uganda as \ncausal factors in conflict.  Third and finally, I conclude with some wider thoughts on \ndecentralization and conflict in countries like Uganda. \n \n2. An Overview of Decentralization in Uganda, 1986-present \n \n2.1. The Evolution of Decentralization in Uganda, 1986-present \n \n 3\nPrior to 1986 Uganda\u2019s local government system was very much controlled \nfrom Kampala, a legacy of Milton Obote\u2019s rule from the 1960s.  After his 1966 coup \nObote centralized control over land at the national Uganda Land Commission and \ngranted the central government the right to appoint all major local government jobs \nand dissolve local councils when it saw fit.  Idi Amin\u2019s rule in the 1970s was no \nbetter: he benevolently allowed local elections for the first time in a decade in March \n1973, only to appoint to local positions 728 soldiers \u2013 who were naturally only \naccountable to Amin and the Ugandan military leadership \u2013 two months later \n(J\u00f8rgensen 1981: 308).  With no change under Obote\u2019s second period in power in the \nearly 1980s, clearly both presidents only saw local government as merely an extended \narm of the central government. \nHowever, since coming to power in 1986, the NRM has invested much effort \ninto completely transforming Uganda\u2019s local government system.  It is difficult to \noverstate how much emphasis the NRM put on the success of its local government \nprogram upon taking power.  Indeed, within months of assuming office Museveni \nappointed a Commission of Inquiry into the Local Government System: according to \nits chairman, Mahmood Mamdani (1997), the Commission \u2018considered the RC system \nas the kernel of the agrarian revolution brought to rural Uganda by the NRM.\u2019  The \nNRM totally altered the formerly top-down local government system by instituting \nlocal democratic control through an increased number of popularly elected posts \nwhile also making all citizens mandatory members of their local Resistance Councils \n(RCs). \n The RC system was first implemented in a trial form as early as 1981, when \nthe NRM and its armed faction the National Resistance Army (NRA) began to \norganize \u2018clandestine committees\u2019 purely as a means for civilians to provide food and \nsecurity for the NRA as it conducted a rebel war against President Obote\u2019s second \ngovernment.  After securing enough territory the NRA named these committees \nResistance Councils (RCs) and allowed them to take on the responsibility of \ngoverning villages as well.  They did not collect taxes but rather judged local disputes, \nmaintained regulations and roads and organized food supplies; RCs even had some \nremit to try and convict NRA soldiers involved in local crimes (Kasfir 2005: 287-\n288). \nAs the NRM regime became established in 1986 it spread the RC system \nthroughout Uganda.  Due to their democratic nature RCs were \u2018greeted with \nenthusiasm,\u2019 winning the \u2018confidence of members of the public\u2026 in most areas of the \ncountry\u2019 (Golooba-Mutebi 1999: 105, 109).  At first the roles and responsibilities of \nthe RCs were unclear, with many RC members initially thinking that their sole \npurpose was to distribute essential products like sugar.  However, the system became \ninstitutionalized with the 1987 Resistance Councils and Committees Statute, which \nset up a five-tier structure of local governance.  The RCs were numbered one through \nfive, with RCI representing the village, RCII the parish, RCIII the sub-county, RCIV \nthe county and RCV the district.  Each level had an executive committee with a chair, \nvice-chair and seven other positions.  All Ugandans residents were by definition \nmembers of their local RCIs, whose elected nine representatives then comprised the \nmembers of the RCIIs, who elected among themselves representatives to send to the \nRCIIIs and so on up through to the RCVs.  Elections for posts would take place every \ntwo years, beginning with the elections of 1987 and 1989, and RCI meetings took \nplace on average once a month.  The districts were administered through the executive \ncouncils of the RCVs, the District Administrators, appointed by President Museveni, \nand the District Executive Secretary, appointed by the Minister of Local Government. \n 4\nThe NRM continued to reform and adjust the local government system.  In \n1992 Museveni launched the Local Government Decentralisation Programme, which \ninitiated financial decentralization in thirteen districts in 1993 and another thirteen the \nnext year, leading to the devolution of \u2018decision-making functions on all matters of \nlocal significance\u2019 to the District Revolutionary Councils (DRCs).  While the centre \nretained responsibility for \u2018security matters, national planning, defence, immigration, \nforeign affairs and national projects\u2026, all other activities become the responsibility of \nthe DRCs\u2019 (NV 6\/4\/1993). \nIn order to monitor this financial decentralization, the NRC passed the Local \nGovernments (Resistance Council) Act of 1993, which transferred power from central \ngovernment representatives to the elected members of the RCV.  Specifically the Act \nreplaced the District Administrator\u2019s position as chairman of the local District \nDevelopment Committee \u2013 whose job was to coordinate development activities in the \ndistrict \u2013 with the RCV chairman, while making the District Executive Secretary \nresponsible to the RCV rather than the Ministry of Local Government.  The Act also \ncreated the Local Government Finance Commission (LGFC), designed to consider \nand recommend local government grants to the President, who appoints the LGFC\u2019s \nseven members every four years.  There are three types of local government grants, \nwhose titles indicate their functions: unconditional, conditional and equalization. \nFurther reforms to the RC system appeared in the 1995 constitution and \nsubsequent acts of Parliament.  The Constitution \u2013 the country\u2019s first since 1967 \u2013 \nrenamed the RCs as Local Councils (LCs) while also mandating direct popular \nelections at all levels of local government.  The Local Government Act of 1997 \nincreased the powers of the local governments while formalizing the distribution of \ndistrict revenue to be allocated to the various LC levels.  For instance, it gave power \nover the hiring and firing of all local civil servants \u2013 some of whom were previously \nappointed by the central government\u2019s Public Service Commission \u2013 to the District \nService Commission, whose members are appointed by the District Council.  As \nregards fiscal matters, power over revenue collection was given to the sub-county, of \nwhich it would retain 42.25%, redistributing 35% to the district, 3.25% each to the \ncounty and parish, and 16.25% to the villages.  The Act also finalized the structure of \nequalization grants that are to be given to districts with poor revenue collection per \ncapita; the government allocated 3.5bn Ush in equalization grants to 34 districts in \n2004\/05, up from 2.5bn in 1999\/2000 (Government of Uganda 2005).  Finally, the \n1998 Land Act decentralized control over land from the Uganda Land Commission in \nKampala to the various District Land Boards and Parish Land Committees, with Land \nTribunals at the LCV and LCIII level. \n \n2.2. Analysis of Uganda\u2019s Decentralization Program \n \nAs noted, Uganda\u2019s decentralization reforms have drawn high praise from a \nvariety of scholars such as Furley (2000: 93), who writes of the LCs as \u2018an important \nstep in increasing democracy\u2019 in Uganda, or Mamdani (1996: 208), who praised the \ncreation of the LC system as one of \u2018enormous significance.\u2019  Government rhetoric \nabout the LC system has also been extremely positive and has often linked the system \nto an increase in national solidarity: the then Minister for Foreign Affairs Ibrahim \nMukiibi claimed that one of the purposes of the LCs was to \u2018promote the national \nawareness and patriotism in our country,\u2019 while deputy Minister Jack Sabiiti claimed \nthat they are a \u2018source of unity\u2019 and \u2018fulfill the ideals and wishes of our ancestors\u2019 \n(NRC Hansard, 24\/6\/1987: 114; 25\/6\/1987: 127). \n 5\nCertainly the most basic positive result of Uganda\u2019s decentralization program \nhas been the way it has helped to prevent any repeat of the conflicts which wracked \nthe country in the 1960s, when the Buganda kingdom government twice attempted to \nsecede from the country.  Indeed, the insipient talks of secession from politicians in \nnorthern Uganda dissatisfied with Museveni\u2019s conduct of the war with the Lord\u2019s \nResistance Army seem to be more tied with the potential secession of southern Sudan \nthan any internal dynamics within Uganda (Mao 2006).  Similarly, the uniform way in \nwhich decentralization has been implemented across the whole country has helped to \ncounter the accusations of regional bias that exist at the national level (Green 2006).  \nWith the sole exception of Kibaale district (as detailed below), President Museveni \nhas not exercised his right to take over the functioning of district governments, even \nas local politicians like Gulu district chairman Norbert Mao explicitly oppose \nMuseveni\u2019s policies and mobilize local resources against the national government.2\nYet, as detailed below, the end effect of Uganda\u2019s decentralization reforms has \nbeen to decentralize conflict to the local level.  In order to examine this phenomenon, \nI first examine the way decentralization has been concentrated at the district level \nbefore moving on to detail the effect of the creation of new districts on local-level \nconflict. \n \n3. Concentrated Decentralisation \n \nUganda\u2019s decentralization reforms were designed to give equal amounts of \npower to the various levels of the LC system, with particular emphasis on the LCIII.  \nHowever, as Wunsch and Ottomoeller (2004: 207) note, \u2018the district is \noverwhelmingly the most powerful actor among the five levels of local government.\u2019  \nThis concentrated decentralization has led to increased levels of local conflict for two \nreasons.  First, the increased concentration of resources at the district level has led to \nstruggles over the district leadership.  Second, the concentration of power at the \ndistrict has led the NRM government to maintain representatives at the district level, \nthereby leading to clashes between national and local governments at the district \nlevel.  After sketching out how power has become concentrated at the district level, I \nexamine each of these conflicts in turn. \n \n3.1. The Concentration of Power at the District Level \n \nDue to the failures of local revenue collection, the ability of districts to attract \ncentral government funds has led to a fiscal concentration at the LCV level.  \nAccording to a LGFC study, \n \n[The] Revenue sources assigned to local governments\u2026 include among others \ngraduated tax, market dues, property tax, parking fees and permits\u2026  In this \narrangement the central government has retained the high yielding taxes while \nthe local governments were left with minor taxes with poor yield, difficult to \nassess, collect and administer (Government of Uganda 2002: 4). \n \nIndeed, LCI-LCIV governments are almost completely reliant upon local revenue, \nmost of which until recently came from graduated personal tax (GPT).  The GPT was \n                                                 \n2 In this regard Museveni should be positively contrasted with the various Prime Ministers of India who \nhave collectively used \u2018President\u2019s Rule\u2019 to take over the functioning of a federal state over 100 times \nsince 1947. \n 6\na very regressive tax, with an upper limit of 80,000 Ush and an \u2018extremely arbitrary\u2019 \nsystem of assessing household income.3  Its subsequent unpopularity first led to a \n\u2018reluctance to collect taxes\u2019 on the part of local governments, which in turn led to a \ncollection rate of only 60% of adults over 18 (Government of Uganda 2002: 4, 28).  \nThus local governments saw their total revenue collection decrease in nominal terms \nfrom 109bn Ush in 1997\/98 to 51bn in 2002\/03 (EA 9\/8\/2004).  As a result of the \nGPT\u2019s low turnover and high unpopularity the NRM eventually decided to eliminate \nit in 2005 to avoid it being a political issue in the 2006 presidential and parliamentary \nelections. \nTo compensate for decreasing local revenues, the central government has \nsubsequently doubled the percentage of total public expenditure spent on local \ngovernment, from 17% in 1994\/95 to 35% in 2001\/02 (Government of Uganda 2002: \n9; Saito 2003: 127).4  Yet these funds are always first dispersed to the district \ngovernments, leading to an inevitable accumulation of what money does exist at the \ndistrict level.  Indeed, as MP Ezati Wadri (Terego, Arua) noted in 2001, \u2018much as the \ncenter is decentralizing the resources and powers to the districts, the districts seem to \nbe still clutching to power and the resources\u2026  When will the districts also \nreciprocate and be able to decentralize resources, authority and power to the lower \nlevels?\u2019 (Parliament of Uganda Hansard, 3\/10\/2001). \nFurthermore, while the percentage of taxes collected by the sub-counties \nrequired by law to be given to the district did reach its source, the reverse was not \ntrue: \u2018the revenues collected by the districts\u2026 [are] never shared with the sub-\ncounties.\u2019  Thus, the LGFC notes, the cash-strapped sub-counties do not have enough \nfunds to send the legally mandated percentage of their revenues to the other levels of \nlocal government: \u2018in some cases villages (LCI) and parishes (LCII) have received \nfunds once in three years\u2026  The situation is made worse by the fact that higher local \ngovernments (districts and municipalities) do not share provide [sic] financial \ninformation to lower local governments\u2019 (Government of Uganda 2002: 24-25, 33-\n34). \nAll the above is compounded by the fact that donors, in their attempt to fund \nUganda\u2019s decentralization program, often bypass the central government in order to \ngive money directly to district governments \u2013 but not to any lower-level units.  \nIndeed, donors have agreed to divide their concentration in Uganda according to \ndistrict, with Austria focusing on Kisoro district, Belgium on Kasese district, \nDenmark on Rakai district, Ireland on Kibaale, Kiboga and Kumi districts, and the \nNetherlands on Arua, Katakwi, Lira, Moyo, Nebbi, Soroti and Yumbe districts.  The \nresult of this focus on the district level is an even larger build-up of assets at the LCV \nlevel (Interview with Martin Kabuye, Kiboga, 15\/11\/2001). \nVarious studies have confirmed this concentration of funds at the district level.  \nFor instance, a Ministry of Local Government survey of nine districts in 2002 noted \nthat \u2018there is hardly any officer in charge of education in all the sub-counties visited\u2026  \nThis is because this function is entirely being performed by the district.\u2019  The same \napplied to health services: \u2018at the sub-county level, health services are almost entirely \n                                                 \n3 A person with an income of 32,000 Ush paid a GPT rate of 9.4% while people with incomes of \n330,000 and 1.5m Ush only paid 5.7% and 5.3%, respectively (Livingstone and Charlton 1998: 504-\n505). \n4 This increase has largely come in the form of the 26 available conditional grants under the Poverty \nAction Fund (PAF), 71% of which is transferred to local governments.  From 1998 to 2001 the PAF \ndoubled as a percentage of the central government\u2019s budget, jumping from 17% to 34% (Government \nof Uganda 2002: 63). \n 7\nbeing performed by the higher local government.\u2019  In his field work in three districts \nin 1999 and 2000, Saito (2003: 138) came to similar conclusions, arguing that \n\u2018disbursements of funds are often hindered by the upper levels of the LC system, \nparticularly by districts for their administrative costs, and the full amount rarely \nreaches lower LCs for the intended local development activities.\u2019  Similarly, Jones \n(2008) notes the way the Kumi district government in eastern Uganda has almost no \npresence at the sub-county or below except in the form of village courts. \n \n3.2. Conflicts over District Leadership \n \nThe result of this concentration of resources at the district level is the \nincreased importance of the position of LCV Chairman.  One need no better example \nof this phenomenon than the decision of Norbert Mao, an MP for Gulu Municipality \nsince 1996, to resign from Parliament in 2006 and run instead for the position of Gulu \nDistrict Chairman.  After winning the election he claimed that he was \u2018tired of being a \ncommentator in Kampala: in local government, you are in charge.  In fact I wish I had \ngone there earlier\u2019 (Mao 2006). \nYet the increased importance and power of the LCV chairman has also led to a \nconcomitant rise in conflict over the position, and as a result elections for LCV Chair, \nheld every five years, are very often fraught affairs, regularly drawing more ire and \nattention than elections for Parliament.  A prime example was the 2002 LCV election \nin Kibaale, a district in western Uganda.  A district which was traditionally populated \nby members of the Banyoro ethnic group, there had been two resettlement schemes in \nthe 1970s and 1990s that brought over Bakiga from the highly-populated area of \nKigezi in south-western Uganda.  The result of these schemes, however, was to \nincrease the percentage of Bakiga in the district to over 50% to the point where \nRobert Kakooza, a Mukiga,5 was elected as MP for Buyaga county in 1996; Kakooza \nwas, however, replaced by Ignatius Musisira, a Munyoro, in the subsequent 2001 \nelection. \nWhile the 1996 parliamentary election was a peaceful affair, the same cannot \nbe said for the 2002 LCV election.  In preparation for the election, between the \nincumbent Munyoro Sebastian Ssekitolekko and the Mukiga Fred Ruremera, a local \nxenophobic Banyoro group launched a campaign of violence that included hate \nspeech on local radio.  Violence inevitably broke out after the election, with several \nBakiga murdered by Banyoro extremists and many more being threatened with \nexpulsion from the district, leading to the deployment of anti-riot police.  President \nMuseveni responded with his first-ever \u2013 and so far only \u2013 use of clause 202 of the \n1995 Constitution of Uganda, which allows him to take over the rule of a district in \nexceptional circumstances, thereby negating Ruremera\u2019s election.  Indeed, rather than \nreprimand the local extremists who stoked up the violence, Museveni replaced \nRuremera with George Namyaka, a native Munyoro, in order to calm the situation \n(Green 2007). \nAnother example comes from neighbouring Kiboga district.  Local MP and \nMinister of State for Defence Ruth Nankabirwa intervened in the 2002 LCV election, \naccusing the incumbent Siraje Kizito of embezzling more than 200m Ush, and then \nlater claimed that Kizito\u2019s subsequent re-election was only due to the illegal \nimportation of voters from outside Kiboga.  In a subsequent trial in Kampala, losing \n                                                 \n5 Mukiga is the singular form for Bakiga; a similar rule applies to other Bantu ethnic groups like the \nBaganda, Banyankole and Banyoro. \n 8\nLCV candidate Edward Katumba accused Kizito, a Muslim, of giving and promising \npiglets to voters in return for votes and accused the EC of failing to update the \ndistrict\u2019s voters register; as a result, the High Court declared the LCV seat vacant and \ncalled for another election in July 2002.  The matter was eventually resolved when the \nCourt of Appeal upheld the election in a unanimous decision, claiming that the \nelectoral irregularities were not large enough to affect the result. \nLCV elections are regularly challenged in court, especially on the charge that \ncandidates do not hold any A-levels, the academic minimum for holding the district \nchairmanship.  As with parliamentary seat elections, which have also been challenged \ndue to lack of academic qualifications, opposition candidates and supporters have \nused the courts to challenge candidates they were previously unable to defeat at the \npolls.  Most recently, the LCV Chairperson of Bududa district in eastern Uganda had \nhis 2006 election nullified by the Ugandan High Court after failing to present official \nA-level papers, while in 2002 the Electoral Commission disqualified three LCV \nchairperson candidates in Kamuli, Mayuge and Mukono districts for lack of \nqualifications.  In Masaka district in southern Uganda the losing candidate in the 2002 \nLCV elections, former MP Shannon Kakungulu, sued the winner, Vincent Ssempijja, \nfor failing to hold the proper qualifications.  After intervention in the case from \nPresident Museveni, NRM Vice-Chairman Moses Kigongo and Minister of Local \nGovernment Jabieri Bidandi-Ssali, Kakungulu dropped the suit, only to have the \ncharge against Ssempijja resurface in the 2006 elections.  In Kiboga district, in 1998 \nthe High Court ruled that the winner of the LCV Chairmanship election did not have \nthe proper academic qualifications to run for the post, forcing a new election.  The by-\nelections held for the post in January 1999, were nullified by the Electoral \nCommission (EC) for various electoral malpractices, including the arrest of seven \nelectoral officers, one of whom was accused of voting more than one hundred times.  \nIn the end the aforementioned Siraje Kizito won the election after only around \u00bc of \nthe electorate voted: the MP Nathias Sewankambo (Kiboga East) blamed the low \nturnout on people\u2019s fear of being arrested by the hundreds of EC officials and \nvolunteers supervising the election. \n \n3.3. National-Local Conflict \n \nThe second reason why power has been concentrated at the district level is \nbecause of the NRM\u2019s interest in maintaining power over local politics.  This is not \natypical of the experience of decentralization in other African countries like Kenya, \nNigeria and Zimbabwe, whose governing parties have simultaneously pursued \ndecentralization while also seeking to extend their political power into the countryside \nin order to win elections (Crook 2003).  Indeed, Uganda\u2019s existence as a \u2018no-party\u2019 \nstate until 2005 meant that the NRM was able to extend itself into countryside through \nofficial state control.  Perhaps the most obvious example of this phenomenon was the \npassing of the Movement Act in 1997, which established an NRM committee at each \nlevel of local government whose members are elected by the next-lowest level.6  In \ndoing so it also made all LC council members from the village to the district \nautomatically members of the NRM, leading to be seen by many Ugandans as \u2018a ploy \nby the Movement to turn the five-tiered [LC] system into branches of the movement\u2019 \n                                                 \n6 In other words, it uses the same indirect voting system by which the RC committees above the village \nlevel were elected prior to the 1995 constitution. \n 9\n(Tripp 2004: 17).  Despite a transition to a multi-party system in 2005, the Movement \nAct still remained on the books for the 2006 LC elections.7\nHowever, these local NRM committees are largely non-functional except \nduring election time.  On a day-to-day basis the central government only has \nrepresentatives at the district level, specifically in the two posts of the Chief \nAdministrative Officer (formerly District Executive Secretary) and the Resident \nDistrict Commissioner (formerly District Administrator).  Inevitably the attempts of \nthe central government to wield power through these two positions has led to conflict \nwith the district governments, as detailed below. \nAs chief technocrat in the district, the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) is \none of the most powerful positions in local government.  The Local Government Acts \nof 1993 and 1997 gave local District Service Commissions the power to appoint their \nCAOs, who were thenceforth responsible to the local LCV.  Yet these Acts did not \nprevent the Ministry of Local Government from intervening in the appointment and \nfiring of CAOs due to its fiscal control over central government grants.  One such \nincident occurred in June 2003, when the Ministry cut off funding for seven districts \nuntil the LCVs had removed their CAOs, while in April 2004 the Ministry Permanent \nSecretary Vincent Ssekono told the Tororo LCV chairman that, if he did not sack the \ndistrict CAO, Ssekono \u2018would advise the ministry of Finance to suspend \nunconditional grants to the district\u2019 (M 14\/6\/2003; M 25\/4\/2004). \nMore recently, in the same Constitutional (Amendment) Bill that removed \npresidential term limits in 2005, the Ugandan government recentralized the role of the \nCAO.  Specifically, it withdrew powers of appointment from the District Service \nCommission and re-allocated them to the Public Service Commission in Kampala.  \nWhile the government claimed that this change was necessary as a means to remove \ncorrupt CAOs, ARD (2005: 40) has correctly noted that the idea that central \ngovernment transfers to local governments are now controlled by central government \nappointees \u2018cuts at the very heart of the decentralization reform.\u2019 \nThe second central government representative, the Resident District \nCommissioner (RDC), is appointed by and responsible to the President and co-\nordinates future planning through the District Development Committee as well as \nmonitoring and overseeing local government programs more generally (Interview \nwith Protaz Tigurihwayo, Masaka, 13\/12\/2001).8  Indeed, the strategy of the NRM in \nmoving RDCs around the country like foreign diplomats, with only a couple of years \nat their post before assuming a new position, has prevented the RDCs from \nidentifying with local concerns against those of the central government.  This was \nquite obvious in the case of Protaz Tigurihwayo, the RDC for Masaka when I visited \nin December 2001 and a Munyankole from Bushenyi district who had never before \nserved as RDC.  Tigurihwayo\u2019s main complaint about the local government system \nwas that his hands were tied by both the LCV chairperson, whom he claimed had too \nmuch power, and by LCV technocrats, whom he claimed should be appointed by the \ncentral government rather than by the District Service Commission (Interview with \nProtaz Tigurihwayo, Masaka, 13\/12\/2001).  Tigurihwayo\u2019s dislike for local \ngovernment staff could explain why the Masaka LCV executive council voted \nunanimously in favour of his transfer on December 18, 2003; he was moved back out \n                                                 \n7 More recently the Ugandan Constitutional Court ruled that the 2006 LC elections were illegal under \nthe new multi-party system; as a result the Parliament passed a law in February 2008 allowing for a \nnew set of local elections across the country. \n8 Tigurihwayo also noted that his job involved \u2018making sure the President\u2019s name is not damaged.\u2019 \n 10\nwest to Ntungamo district in President Museveni\u2019s 2003 RDC reshuffle five days \nlater. \nAs regards the RDC\u2019s role in elections, the International Foundation for \nElection Systems noted that  \n \nThe RDCs play an important role in many districts, controlling the electoral \ncolleges representing these special interest groups as well as administering the \npolitical mobilizers in each district and the party schools. The RDCs played a \npartisan role in [the 1996 presidential and parliamentary] elections\u2026 (quoted \nin Human Rights Watch 1999, Chapter 6). \n \nMore recently, in the context of the 2004 debate about President Museveni\u2019s potential \nthird term, the RDCs were accused by MPs of serving as NRM apparatchiks: \n \nGeoffrey Ekanya (Tororo) and Miria Matembe (Mbarara) said resident district \ncommissioners were barring politicians including anti-Movement MPs from \nholding meetings.  Matembe said RDCs had taken on the role of parroting \ninstead of monitoring or overseeing developments by local governments on \nbehalf of the Government.  \u201cIf you are not carrying mashansha (dry banana \nleaves, a symbol of third term for presidency) the RDC hates you,\u201d she said \n(NV 14\/8\/2004). \n \nThat RDCs are generally pro-Movement should not be too surprising, considering that \nMuseveni has made it a policy to appoint political allies who had lost elections; for \ninstance, in his 2007 reshuffle he appointed as RDCs former ministers Alfred Ogaba \nand Wanjusi Wasieba, losers in the 2006 Mbale Municipality and 2001 Aruu County \nMP elections, respectively.  Naturally, while RDCs have failed to draw criticism from \nthe Ministry of Local Government for being too pro-Movement, the Ministry has not \nrefrained from rebuking CAOs or RDCs for \u2018engaging in politics and issuing political \nstatements\u2019 when they \u2018criticize leaders in government,\u2019 as in the case where the \nSironko district CAO blamed President Museveni for a shortfall in local revenue (NV \n14\/8\/2004).  For these reasons the main opposition candidate in the 2001 and 2006 \npresidential elections, Kizza Besigye, promised in 2006 to abolish the position of \nRDC if he were elected. \n It is therefore hardly surprising that one parliamentarian complained in \nreference to the CAO that \u2018decentralization means that powerful district leaders are \nassigned instead of being elected from within\u2019 (Constituent Assembly Proceedings \n6\/7\/1994: 624), and that little has changed in the intervening years to invalidate this \nclaim. \n \n4. District Creation \n \nUganda has seen an explosion in the number of districts, going from 33 in \n1986 to 80 in 2007.  While this expansion has ostensibly been guided by the 1995 \nconstitution, whose Article 179 permits the government to create new districts \u2018on the \nnecessity for effective administration and the need to bring services closer to the \npeople,\u2019 it is more likely Museveni has employed district creation as a source of \npatronage that allows him to continue winning elections (Green 2008).  The creation \nof these new districts has, however, increasingly politicizing ethnicity in Uganda \ndespite Museveni\u2019s claims to the contrary.  It is thus not clear that, despite Treisman \n 11\n(2007: 245)\u2019s claim to the contrary, the creation of new local government units has \nstabilized politics in Uganda. \nIn this section I first sketch a history of district creation in Uganda before \nexamining the increased levels of local conflict over district creation since 1986. \n \n4.1. A History of District Creation in Uganda \n \n Under British colonialism Uganda was divided into four provinces, namely \nnorthern, eastern, western and the kingdom of Buganda.  These provincial divisions \nwere largely unimportant in the formation of political identities with the exception of \nthe case of Buganda.  Rather, each province was further divided into sixteen districts, \nwhich were overseen by British District Commissioners.  Other than in Buganda these \ndistricts were created along \u2018tribal\u2019 lines, whereby each district was supposedly \nethnically homogenous and was ruled through \u2018traditional\u2019 leadership.  These districts \nwere thus important in the subsequent formation of ethnic identity, for instance in the \ncase of the Acholi and the Karamojong in the north and the Iteso in the east (Apter \n1959).  However, the British conception of African tribes as eternal and unchanging \nmeant that new districts were very rarely created, and then only for explicitly \nadministrative purposes. \nUpon independence in 1962 Uganda\u2019s provincial divisions were dropped with \none exception, Buganda, which subsequently became a federal state.  However, \nclashes between the then President of Uganda, the Kabaka (King) of Buganda, and \nPrime Minister Milton Obote led to the latter ousting the former in a coup in 1966, \nleading to the abolishment of Buganda as a governmental unit in Obote\u2019s 1967 \nconstitution.  Idi Amin, however, subsequently reintroduced ten provincial \ngovernments in 1974, this time under the rule of military Governors, while also \nalmost doubling the number of districts to 37.  As J\u00f8rgensen (1981: 309) notes, the \nreintroduction of the provinicial level as well as new districts provided patronage \nposts for Amin\u2019s more ambitious soldiers, thereby relieving pressure on national \npolitics and giving the new governors free reign to wreak havoc on the countryside. \nAfter Amin was overthrown the Uganda National Liberation Front \ngovernment of 1979-1980 reduced the number of districts to 33, where it remained for \na decade.  Museveni\u2019s aforementioned Commission of Inquiry into the Local \nGovernment system \u2013 whose members were largely composed of academics, \nincluding current Prime Minister Apolo Nsibambi \u2013 deliberated about the creation of \nnew districts.  It was, by implication, very critical of the proliferation of districts \nunder Amin, arguing that, \u2018quite often, the response of governments to popular \ndemands for a more responsive administration (e.g., better services) has been to create \nnew and smaller units\u2026 There is no doubt that the multiplication of administrative \nunits is a costly affair\u2019 (Government of Uganda 1987: 117).  In principle, the \nCommission, noted, \n \nWe were hesitant to recommend the creation of new and additional \nadministrative units, bearing in mind that these would increase unproductive \ncosts of administration, both in terms of creating an administrative \ninfrastructure and payment of personnel\u2026  Given our strong view that the \nexercise in creating new districts over the past decade and a half has been \narbitrary, haphazard and hardly defensible, we would have recommended a \nreview of the status of all existing districts with a view to de-grading those \nwhich do not meet minimum criteria\u2026 Should such a review be undertaken in \n 12\nthe present circumstances, it would undoubtedly result in a large number of \nthe newly created districts losing their existing status (Government of Uganda \n1987: 121-123). \n \nAfter spending several months touring the country, the Commission \naccumulated eleven requests for the creation of new districts, of which it only \nrecommended four.  Yet Museveni, while failing to pursue the review of existing \ndistricts as recommended by the Commission, nonetheless withheld the creation of \nany new districts, only relenting on the case of Kalangala (comprising the Ssese \nislands in Lake Victoria) in 1990.  The next year, however, Museveni undertook the \nother three recommendations of the Commission and added another, the \naforementioned district of Kiboga.  As Table 1 demonstrates, Museveni continued to \nadd districts in 1994, 1997 and 2000 before announcing the creation of 23 new \ndistricts in 2005, the largest ever increase in Uganda\u2019s history.9  Thus Uganda now \nhas 80 districts, more than twice as many as when Museveni took office and more \nthan four times as many as when Amin took office in 1971. \n \nTable 1: District Creation in Uganda \n(Sources: Government of Uganda 1987, Ocwich 2005, US Census Bureau) \n \nYear Number of Districts Population per District \n1959 16 443,000 \n1962 17 456,365 \n1968 18 513,711 \n1971 19 526,853 \n1974 37 292,211 \n1979 33 368,115 \n1990 34 513,412 \n1991 38 476,474 \n1994 39 514,256 \n1997 45 455,718 \n2000 56 427,786 \n2005 70 402,848 \n2006 80 365,081 \n \nFurthermore, as Table 2 indicates, Uganda has the highest number of sub-\nnational political units \u2013 here understood as the highest level of local government \u2013 of \nany country in Africa,10 as well as a population per district ratio among the lowest on \nthe continent.  Compared to other Anglophone countries and its neighbors in the Great \nLakes region, Uganda has a lower population per highest-level unit ratio than any \nother country except Namibia and Botswana, which have extremely low population \ndensities.  Indeed, Uganda has less than half the population per district than Kenya \ndoes in her districts, despite the fact that Kenya\u2019s districts are secondary to her states, \nputting them at the same administrative level as Uganda\u2019s counties. \n \n                                                 \n9 The districts were created in two sets, with fourteen new ones inaugurated in 2005 and another ten in \n2006. \n10 In fact, Uganda has the fourth-highest number of highest-level units of any country in the world, \nafter Russia (83), the Philippines (82) and Turkey (81) and just ahead of Thailand (76).  I owe this \npoint to John McGarry. \n 13\nTable 2: Sub-National Political Units (Highest Level) in Select African Countries \n(Source: CIA World Factbook, US Census Bureau) \n \nCountry Name of Unit Number of Units Population\/Unit \nNamibia Regions 13 157,231 \nBotswana Districts 9 182,222 \nUganda Districts 80 365,081 \nBurundi Provinces 17 475,882 \nMalawi Districts 27 492,000 \nZimbabwe Provinces 10 1,223,700 \nZambia Provinces 9 1,254,222 \nTanzania Regions 26 1,440,192 \nSierra Leone Provinces 4 1,501,250 \nSudan States 26 1,586,000 \nRwanda Provinces 5 1,927,600 \nGhana Regions 10 2,247,900 \nDR of Congo Provinces 26 2,410,038 \nNigeria States 37 3,563,784 \nKenya Provinces 8 4,486,375 \n Districts 40 897,275 \nSouth Africa Provinces 9 4,909,778 \n \n4.2. District Creation and Conflict in Uganda \n \nWhile a variety of explanations have been given as to the extreme nature of \ndistrict creation in Uganda, perhaps the most plausible is that new districts have been \na source of electoral patronage for Museveni.  The large number of local jobs that are \ncreated with the addition of each new district have led voters to respond positively to \ndistrict creation over the years: Table 3 demonstrates that voters in new districts were \nmore likely to vote for Museveni than in other districts across the 1996, 2001 and \n2006 presidential elections. \n \nTable 3: Presidential Election Results for New Districts \n(Source: Green (2008)) \n \nElection Type of District Museveni (%) Other Candidates (%) \n1996: New Districts 89.2 10.8 \n Ugandan Average 74.3 25.7 \n \n2001: New Districts 72.5 27.5 \n Ugandan Average 69.4 30.6 \n \n2006: New Districts 73.6 26.4 \n Ugandan Average 59.3 40.7 \n \nMPs have also been very happy to support district creation, as seen in 2005 \nwhen the most recent bout of district creation passed Parliament by a vote of 175 to \nnone with one abstention, with hardly any debate about its detrimental aspects.  As \nwith voters, MPs have also seen the benefits of the jobs new districts can bring: for \ninstance, MP Tiperu Nusura (Women, Yumbe) appreciated the \u2018many more Women \n 14\nMembers of Parliament and jobs for the unemployed\u2019 (Parliament of Uganda \nHansard, 20 July, 2005).  Nusura is correct to note the increased presence of Women \nMPs \u2013 one of whom is elected from each district \u2013 in Parliament, who have increased \nin number by 30 since the ratification of the 1995 constitution.  Thus, of the 309 \nvoting MPs, 69 are women MPs; while only 14.0% were women MPs in 1996, that \nratio increased to 24.3% in 2008. \nAlong the same lines, another MP, Omara Atube (Otaka, Lira), noted that \n \nMr Speaker, the purpose of creating new districts is not about bringing \nservices nearer to the people, but to contain tribal sentiments and create jobs. \nYou are creating districts by dividing a group of people who should be in one \ncounty and taking them to another county. Somebody will contest for \nleadership from there because he belongs to that ethnic group, this group is a \nminority. These are realities of politics in Uganda (Parliament of Uganda \nHansard, 20 July, 2005) \n \nAtube is likewise correct to bring up the issue of ethnicity and district creation, as \nthose ethnic groups without their \u2018own\u2019 district have been in the forefront for \nlobbying for district creation.  This discourse was already noticeable in the mid-\n1980s, as the Local Government Commission received numerous requests for the \ncreation of ethnically-defined districts.  For instance, members of the self-described \n\u2018Batagwenda\u2019 ethnic group requested the creation of Ibanda district in western \nUganda, claiming that their ethnic distinctiveness was reason enough to carve a new \ndistrict out of Bushenyi, Kabarole and Mbarara districts (Government of Uganda \n1987: 127-128). \n On the one hand, the creation of new districts has never openly been linked to \nethnicity since Museveni assumed office.  The Commission rejected Ibanda and \nsimilar attempts at creating ethnically homogenous districts on the basis that such \ngroups did not face discrimination within their district, while also noting that it \nrejected the creation of Busia district in eastern Uganda as it \u2018has the potential of \nundermining the trend towards Tororo [district] becoming a successful ethnic \n\u201cmelting pot\u201d\u2019 (Government of Uganda 1987: 130).  Similarly, Museveni himself has \nexplicitly rejected the creation of new districts along ethnic lines, warning local \npoliticians against \u2018creating division among the people\u2019 (NV 4\/8\/1997). \nOn the other hand, district creation has nonetheless been driven by a de facto, \nif not de jure, balkanization of local politics in Uganda.  This process began with the \nlisting of 56 \u2018indigenous communities\u2019 in the Third Schedule of the 1995 \nConstitution, whose numbers have since been expanded to include nine more such \ncommunities.  What is striking about the Third Schedule is the way it defines \nindigeneity in Uganda as based on ethnic membership rather than geographic \nresidence, a point that has drawn criticism from Mamdani (2001).  Thus, according to \nthe constitution, one is not an indigenous member Ugandan unless one\u2019s ethnic group \nis listed in the Third Schedule, thereby creating the pressure for the ever-expanding \nnumber of ethnic groups listed in the Schedule.  While the Third Schedule has not \nostensibly been the basis for new district creation, it is clear that, once recognized in \nthe constitution, ethnic groups have a greater claim to their own district.  Indeed, it is \nno coincidence that the debate in the Parliament prior to the creation of new districts \non 20 July, 2005, was about the further addition of nine ethnic groups to this list, \nleading to one MP complaining, \u2018let us not start creating tribes like we are going to create \ndistricts\u2019 (Parliament of Uganda Hansard, 20 July, 2005). \n 15\nThus, rather than containing ethnic sentiments as suggested by Atube above, \nthe balkanization of Uganda into what the East African newspaper called \u2018small tribal \ndistricts\u2019 (EA 8\/7\/2002) has led to the increased salience of ethnicity in local politics \nas various ethnic groups claim their own districts.  Similarly, despite evidence that a \nmajority of new districts do not result in an ethnic group changing from minority to \nmajority status in either the new or the \u2018mother\u2019 district (Green 2008), it is clear that \nthe creation of new districts has reduced what were once ethnically heterogeneous \ndistricts to ones largely populated by only one or two major ethnic groups, a state of \naffairs identified as potentially dangerous by numerous scholars of civil wars (Collier \nand Hoeffler 1998, De Soysa 2002).  Four examples of how the creation of new \ndistricts has led to local level ethnic conflict should suffice to demonstrate the \npervasiveness of this phenomenon. \nThe first example is the division of Kabarole district in western Uganda into \nthree districts in 2000.  While Kabarole was and is seen as the core territory of the \nToro Kingdom and thus home to the Batoro ethnic group, it has also been home to \nvarious indigenous minority communities such as the Bakiga, Banyankole and \nBatagwenda.  Yet by the late 1990s members of these minority communities, all three \nof whom are listed as indigenous in the Constitution, felt confident enough to petition \nMuseveni for the creation of two new districts, Kyenjojo and Kamwenge, along ethnic \nlines.  As Batoro would no longer be dominant numerically in these two new districts, \nkingdom supporters were worried that Kyenjojo and Kamwenge would \u2018secede\u2019 from \nthe kingdom;11 similarly, with control over land now vested in District Land Boards \n(see above), Batoro would no longer be in charge of land allocation in the new \ndistricts.  As a result noted Ugandan journalist Andrew Mwenda (1999) reported at \nthe time that \u2018people are even arming themselves for a possible war\u2019 in the region, \nleading to intense talks between various military and security leaders from Kampala \nand local leaders.  In the end President Museveni relented and explicitly went back on \nhis previous commitment against the creation of new districts along ethnic lines, \nnoting later in a speech that he had supported the new districts as their inhabitants \nwere ethnically different from the surrounding Batoro people (NV 24\/4\/2002). \nA second example comes from the aforementioned Kibaale district, whose \nresidents are split between members of the Banyoro and Bakiga ethnic groups and \nwho have often clashed in recent years (see section 3.2 above).  During the 2006 \npresidential campaign Museveni proposed the removal of the Bakiga-dominated \nBuyaga county from Kibaale and its re-creation as a new district, which would make \nKibaale once again a Banyoro-dominated district.  Yet, as with the Toro kingdom and \nKabarole district above, the Bunyoro kingdom government rejected any proposed new \ndistrict in its territory where Banyoro would be dominated by non-Banyoro Ugandans \nand which would therefore most likely secede from the kingdom.  Local Bakiga, of \ncourse, welcomed the proposed district, thereby exacerbating the already serious rift \nbetween the two communities that has been erupting off and on since 2002 (Green \n2007). \n                                                 \n11 After having been abolished by Milton Obote in 1967, four of Uganda\u2019s kingdoms (Busoga, \nBuganda, Bunyoro and Toro) were restored in 1993, albeit as cultural institutions with no power over \ntaxation or administration.  While districts thus do not currently contribute any funds to the upkeep of \nkingdom, Buganda monarchists have led the drive to create regional or federal tiers of government at \nthe level of the kingdoms, which would then have both fiscal and political power.  As LRA negotiators \nhave also come out recently in support of a regional tier system, its eventual creation continues to look \nmore and more likely, thereby creating a large incentive for kingdom governments to prevent districts \nunder their nominal aegis from seceding. \n 16\nA third example comes from ethnically Japadhola-dominated Tororo district in \neastern Uganda, where a number of minority Iteso residents in Tororo county have \npetitioned the government for their own district.  The Commission of Inquiry \nappointed by the central government agreed to create the district but failed to assign \nthe current district capital, whose residents are both Japadhola and Iteso, to the new \ndistrict.  The rift led to ethnic divisions in the February 2006 parliamentary race, with \nmany local Iteso supporting the Ugandan Asian candidate Sanjay Tana against the \nincumbent MP for Tororo Municipality, Yeri Ofwono.  After winning the election, \nTana escaped a petrol bomb attack at his residence in April 2006, while in August \nsoldiers from the Ugandan Peoples Defence Forces (UPDF, the Ugandan army) \nforcibly broke up a meeting of Tororo county councillors on the behest of the LCV \nchairman.  In October 2006 the UPDF was again deployed in town after rumours that \nlocal Iteso extremists were planning on burning down the district headquarters.  \nMaking explicit the logic of district creation under Museveni, one local councillor \nnoted in anger, \u2018even areas which did not ask for districts have been given and have \nstarted operating.  We have been asking for a district since 1998\u2019 (M 6\/10\/2006). \nA fourth and final example comes from Buliisa, a new district created in July \n2006 on the north-eastern shores of Lake Albert.  Less than a year later violent \nconflict broke out between members of the majority Bagungu ethnic group, \nhistorically considered a sub-clan of the Banyoro but nonetheless listed as an \nindigenous ethnic group in the Constitution, and Banyarwanda pastoralists, known \nlocally as Balaalo (herdsmen).  Accusations that the Balaalo, whom many locals \naccused of being Rwandan immigrants, had allowed their cattle to graze onto \nBagungu agricultural land and destroy crops led to bloody clashes in June and July \n2007, drawing anti-riot police and attempts by the central government to resettle the \nBalalo elsewhere in Uganda.  While the conflict is multi-faceted and undoubtedly \nrelated to the recent oil exploration in the Lake Albert region, it is notable that there is \nno record of any Bagungu\/Balaalo clashes before the creation of Buliisa district, \ndespite evidence that the Balaalo first purchased land in the region in 2003.  \nMoreover, one of the local Bagungu most often accused of instigating the conflict is \nthe local MP Stephen Birahwa Mukitale, who was elected in 2006 after successfully \npetitioning for the creation of Buliisa district; the new government positions of LCV \nChairperson and Women MP created along with the district also went to Bagungu \nhardliners unwilling to compromise with the Balaalo.  Thus, as with Tororo and \nelsewhere, the creation of new districts has allowed local extremists to assume power \nand exacerbate ethnic tensions. \n \n5. Conclusion \n \n As more generally with Museveni\u2019s rule, which has turned sour for both \nUgandans and donors in recent years, the initial expectation that the LC system would \nradically transform local politics in Uganda has not been fulfilled.  As Golooba-\nMutebi (1999: 149) writes, \u2018much of the applause heaped on the [LC] system in its \njuvenile days was precipitate.  Ten years after the system had been established \ncountrywide, it had began to show signs of atrophy and possible terminal decline.\u2019  \nSimilarly, Mamdani (1996; 1997)\u2019s initial infatuation with the LC system had \ndiminished by 2001, when he termed the reforms of the LC system merely \u2018partial \nand tentative\u2019 (Mamdani 2001: 171).  Thus, despite measuring favourably against the \nautocratic local government system under Obote and Amin, it is clear that the LC \nsystem has failed to live up to its preliminary expectations. \n 17\nThese diminished expectations have no doubt been in part driven by the way \ndecentralization has increased local-level conflict in Uganda in recent years.  The \nconcentration of power at the LCV level has led to struggles for power over district \nleadership positions, as exemplified most violently in the case of Kibaale but also in \nKiboga and Masaka, as well as clashes between local and national governments at the \ndistrict level.  Similarly, Museveni\u2019s ongoing efforts to create new districts have \nintensified, rather than diminished, local ethnic conflicts as the creation of districts \nhas altered the majority\/minority status of local ethnic groups and thereby intensified \ninter-ethnic competition in such districts as Buliisa, Kabarole, Kibaale and Tororo. \nOf course, to assume that Museveni is solely to blame for ongoing local-level \nconflict in Uganda would be to ignore the difficulties involved in governing an \nunderdeveloped state like Uganda.  As with other African states, the power of the \ncentral government in Uganda does not extend very far or deep outside urban areas, \nwhich has led Museveni to concentrate local power at the district level and then \nattempt to control that power through central-government appointees.  He has \nsimilarly attempted to funnel resources to local clients at the local level by creating \nnew districts.  Indeed, it is no coincidence that Museveni proposed the creation of new \ndistricts in July 2005, less than a week before the Parliament voted to overturn \npresidential term limits and allow him to run for a third term. \nIn this sense Uganda does not look very different from other underdeveloped \nstates like Nigeria and Sudan that have been unable to balance efforts at devolution \nand decentralization of power with conflict prevention and resolution.  One of the \nclear lessons from Uganda is that the decentralization of power to the highest level of \nlocal government without an accompanying further decentralization of power to lower \nlevels of local government is a recipe for conflict.  This is the same problem in \nsouthern Sudan, where the concentration of power in the Government of Southern \nSudan has excluded non-Dinka Equatorians and thus led to violent local ethnic \nconflict (Branch and Mampilly 2005).  However, another lesson from ethnically \nheterogeneous states like Uganda is that this very same decentralization of power to \nsmaller political units can increase local-level conflict by shifting power from \nethnically heterogeneous areas to those dominated by only one or two ethnic groups.  \nIndeed, the creation of new states and Local Government Areas across Nigeria since \nthe 1970s has not only failed to halt ethnic and religious violence but may have even \ncontributed to it (Ukiwo 2006).  Uganda\u2019s and Nigeria\u2019s experience here thus echoes \nTreisman (2007: 239)\u2019s worry that decentralization along ethnic lines \u2018merely \nrelocates the problem [of minority ethnic representation] rather than solves it.\u2019 \nOf course, these two lessons are somewhat contradictory, in that one argues \nfor more decentralization while the other cautions against it.  It is for these types of \ncontradictions that Treisman (2007) correctly concludes that decentralization in and of \nitself cannot be seen as a necessary tool in conflict prevention and resolution.  The \nUgandan evidence here thus suggests that a more nuanced understanding of \ndecentralization at the national and sub-national level is necessary to understand \nbetter how and when it may alleviate or exacerbate conflict.  Certainly the next step is \nto examine in more detail similar processes in other such countries in order to \ngenerate more general conclusions on this topic. \n 18\nBibliography \n \nApter, David E., 1959. \u2018Local Government in Uganda\u2019.
