In each case the spectrum failed to reveal com-\npelling evidence for the presence of a spatially unresolved, cool, late-type companion. There-\nfore, we have placed an approximate limit on the spectral type of a putative companion to each\ndegenerate. From these limits we conclude that if GD659, GD50, GD71 or WD2359\u2212434 pos-\nsesses an unresolved companion then most probably it is substellar in nature (M < 0.072 M\u0001).\nFurthermore, any spatially unresolved late-type companion to RE J0457\u2212280, RE J0623\u2212374,\nRE J0723\u2212274 or RE J2214\u2212491 most likely has M < 0.082 M\u0001. These results imply that\nif weak accretion from a nearby late-type companion is the cause of the unusual photospheric\ncomposition observed in a number of these degenerates then the companions are of very low\nmass, beyond the detection thresholds of this study. Furthermore, these results do not contra-\ndict a previously noted deficit of very-low-mass stellar and brown dwarf companions to main\nsequence F, G, K and early-M type primaries (a \u0001 1000 au).\nKey words: stars: abundances \u2013 binaries: spectroscopic \u2013 stars: low-mass, brown dwarfs \u2013\nwhite dwarfs.\n1 I N T RO D U C T I O N\nExamples of white dwarfs in binary systems with early to mid-M\ndwarf companions are plentiful. Many are resolved as common\nproper motion pairs (e.g. Silvestri et al. 2001), while a number of un-\nresolved systems have recently been identified through near-infrared\n(near-IR) photometry (e.g. Green, Ali & Napiwotzki 2000). A fur-\nther proportion are revealed in optical spectra either as excess red\nemission or through the detection of narrow emission components\nin the cores of the H I Balmer absorption lines of the white dwarf\n(e.g. Thorstensen, Vennes & Shambrook 1994). This emission may\neither be intrinsic to an active cool companion (e.g. RE J1629+780,\nCooke et al. 1992; Sion et al. 1995), or be due to the irradiation of\nthe atmosphere of the cool star facing the hot white dwarf, particu-\nlarly if the system components are close (e.g. Vennes & Thorstensen\n1994). The latter systems are of interest as one outcome of common\nenvelope (CE) evolution and\/or as the precursors of cataclysmic\nvariable systems (pre-CVs). Some may even be old CVs during a\n\u0001E-mail: pdd@star.le.ac.uk\nperiod of no mass transfer (Howell & Ciardi 2001). As relatively\nfew of these close systems are known, when discovered they are\nintensively studied spectroscopically to obtain mass functions from\nthe radial velocity curves (e.g. Vennes, Thorstensen & Polomski\n1999).\nIn contrast, very few white dwarfs with late-M and cooler com-\npanions of very-low stellar or substellar mass are known (e.g. Farihi,\nBecklin & Zuckerman 2003). This is likely to be due, in part, to the\nspectral energy distribution of such systems being dominated at op-\ntical wavelengths by the white dwarf, particularly if the degenerate\nstar is relatively hot (T eff \u0002 10 000 K). In these systems the compan-\nion instead may be revealed photometrically as an infrared excess,\nfor example, the white dwarf + L4 dwarf pair GD165 (Becklin &\nZuckerman 1988; Kirkpatrick et al. 1999) or through the detection of\nfeatures characteristic of a cool dwarf in a near-IR spectrum. Indeed,\nFarihi & Christopher (2004) have recently announced the detection\nfrom 2MASS photometry and K-band IR spectroscopy of an unre-\nsolved companion with spectral type L5.5 or later to the ZZ Ceti\nwhite dwarf GD1400. This probably represents the first unambigu-\nous detection of a substellar companion to a white dwarf. However,\ndespite Makarov (2004) having recently claimed the existence of a\nC\u00a9 2005 RAS\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n1050 P. D. Dobbie et al.\nsubstellar companion with a mass of 0.06 \u00b1 0.02 M\u0001 to the near-\nest isolated white dwarf, van Maanen 2, on the basis of Hipparcos\nastrometric measurements, a subsequent attempt to directly detect\nthis brown dwarf, in adaptive optics images obtained in the L-band\nand archival mid-infrared ISO observations, has been unsuccess-\nful. Therefore, his interpretation is now virtually ruled out (Farihi,\nBecklin & MacIntosh 2004). Furthermore, although Wachter et al.\n(2003) have recently identified 47 new unresolved white dwarf + red\ndwarf binaries from 2MASS photometry, they are unable to claim\nany as bona fide very-low-mass stars or brown dwarfs.\nNevertheless, the detection of white dwarf + very-low-mass stel-\nlar or brown dwarf binaries is an important issue. In some apparently\nisolated white dwarfs, there exist puzzling heavy element abundance\nanomalies which appear to imply some external source of accretion.\nThis is because the time-scales for the gravitational settling of heavy\nelements are very short compared with the white dwarf cooling time\n(e.g. Dupuis et al. 1993). Unless this high-Z material is accreted\nfrom very dense interstellar clouds, there must exist some unseen\nsource associated with the white dwarf itself. For example, high lev-\nels of refractory elements such as Mg, Al, Si and Ca are observed in\nthe photosphere of EG 102, yet the residence time for these on the\nwhite dwarf surface is only 3 d (Holberg, Barstow & Green 1997).\nFurthermore, unexpectedly large abundances of Ca, Mg and Fe are\nobserved in the atmosphere of the massive cool hydrogen-rich white\ndwarf GD362. Gianninas, Dufour & Bergeron (2004) argue that it\nis unlikely that the origin of these metals is accretion of interstel-\nlar material. Indeed, Zuckerman et al. (2003) have recently noted\nthe high frequency of DAZ stars which are part of known binary\nsystems and have suggested that wind-driven mass loss from the\nred dwarf companion may be responsible for a proportion of the\nobserved DAZ stars.\nAdditionally, observations of such systems can be of use in plac-\ning limits on the fraction of normal stars with very-low-mass stellar\nor substellar companions at a \u0001 1000 au, when part of a statistically\nrobust campaign. This range of separation is of particular interest\nas current radial velocity and coronographic imaging surveys may\nindicate a discrepancy between the brown dwarf companion fraction\nat small separation (a < 1000 au; 1 \u00b1 1 per cent; Marcy & Butler\n2000; McCarthy & Zuckerman 2004) and large radii (a > 1000 au;\n10\u201330 per cent; Gizis et al. 2001), although the validity of this lat-\nter result is still debated. Indeed, models of binary evolution which\ninclude a population of zero-age main-sequence + substellar pairs\npredict the existence of a population of cataclysmic variables with\norbital periods \u00012.5 h and which contain brown dwarf secondaries\n(e.g. Politano 2004). Despite a small number of candidates for such\nsystems having been found (e.g. Howell & Ciardi 2001 believe they\nhave directly detected via infrared spectroscopy substellar secon-\ndaries in LL And and EF Eri), all lie above the observed CV period\nminimum (\u223c75 min) and evolutionary models suggest it more likely\nthat the secondaries in these systems have evolved through mass loss\nto become substellar as opposed to them being born brown dwarfs.\nWe have recently instigated an observational programme to ob-\ntain near-IR spectroscopy of notable DA white dwarfs, the aim of\nwhich is to search for very-low-mass (mid-late-M, L and possibly T\ndwarf) companions which may explain, for example, peculiarities\nin their measured photospheric compositions or in their observed\nenergy distributions. The presence of low-mass companions may\nbe revealed through a subtle excess in continuum emission above\nthat expected from the white dwarf alone, and through absorption\nsignatures typical to cool dwarfs such as Na I, K I and H2O. Our\ntargets are predominantly hot objects (T eff \u0002 30 000 K) which have\nbeen studied extensively at extreme ultraviolet (EUV), far-UV, UV\nand optical wavelengths, but for which no detailed examination at\nnear-IR wavelengths has been published. More specifically we have\nconcentrated on objects with no robust detection of a companion\nin existing data sets but (i) with unexplained abundance anoma-\nlies, (ii) with significant residuals between their observed Balmer\nlines and synthetic profiles or narrow H I Balmer emission lines,\n(iii) which show radial velocity variations or (iv) well-known white\ndwarf standards. Here we report the results based on our observa-\ntions conducted with the New Technology Telescope (NTT) for a\nsmall collection of such degenerates with predominantly southern\ndeclinations.\n2 N E A R - I R S P E C T RO S C O P Y\n2.1 Observations\nLow-resolution near-IR spectra were obtained for a number of white\ndwarfs with predominantly southern declinations using the ESO\nNTT and the Son-of-Isaac (SOFI) infrared instrument on 2003\nDecember 9 and 10. The sky conditions at the La Silla site were good\non both nights with seeing typically in the range 0.6\u20131.0 arcsec with\nsome small patches of cirrus cloud confined to the region of sky close\nto the southern horizon. SOFI operates at the Naysmyth A focus of\nthe NTT and includes a Rockwell Hg:Cd:Te Hawaii detector with\n1024 \u00d7 1024 18.5-\u00b5m pixels. In the low-resolution spectroscopic\nmode (\u03bb\/\u03b4\u03bb \u223c 950 with the 0.6-arcsec slit), as used for this work,\ncoverage of the wavelength ranges 0.95\u20131.64 and 1.53\u20132.52 \u00b5m is\nprovided by the \u2018blue\u2019 and the \u2018red\u2019 grism, respectively. The obser-\nvations were undertaken using the standard technique of nodding our\npoint source targets back and forth along the spectrograph slit in an\nABBA pattern. The individual on-target exposure times were cho-\nsen to ensure that while the data were background-limited, the sky\nwas sampled frequently and the total counts in each pixel were com-\nfortably within the linear regime of the detector (\u000110 000 ADU).\nTo minimize detector overheads we used the double-correlated read\nmode, which is well suited to these low-resolution spectroscopic\nobservations. The total integration times used for each white dwarf\nwith the blue and the red grism are shown in Table 1. To facilitate the\nremoval of telluric features from the target spectra and to provide\nan approximate flux calibration, a standard star was observed either\nimmediately before or after each science integration. These were\ncarefully chosen to lie within \u223c0.1 airmasses of each white dwarf.\nIn addition, regular exposures of the xenon lamp were obtained to\npermit reliable wavelength calibration of the spectra.\n2.2 Data reduction\nTo reduce the data we have applied standard techniques using soft-\nware routines in the STARLINK packages KAPPA and FIGARO. In\nbrief, a bad pixel mask was constructed by merging a list of anoma-\nlously valued pixels clipped from dark frames with a generic map of\nbad array elements obtained from the ESO SOFI webpages.1 This\nwas applied to all the data. The science, standard star and arc lamp\nspectral images were flat-fielded with a normalized response map\nappropriate to either the blue or the red grism setup. Subsequently,\ndifference pairs were assembled from the science and standard star\nimages and any significant remaining sky background removed by\nsubtracting linear functions, fitted in the spatial direction, from the\ndata.

Any features intrinsic to the energy dis-\ntributions of the standard stars were identified by reference to a\nnear-IR spectral atlas of fundamental MK standards (Wallace &\nHinkle 1997; Meyer et al. 1998; Wallace et al. 2000) and were re-\nmoved by linearly interpolating over them. The spectrum of each\nwhite dwarf was then co-aligned with the spectrum of its standard\nstar by cross-correlating the telluric features present in the data. The\nscience spectra were divided by the standard star spectra and multi-\nplied by a blackbody with the standard star T eff, taking into account\nthe differences in exposure times. Finally, the flux levels were scaled\nto (i) achieve the best possible agreement between the blue and the\nred spectrum of each white dwarf in the overlap region between 1.53\nand 1.64 \u00b5m, and (ii) to obtain the best possible agreement between\nthe spectral data and the J, H and KS photometric fluxes for each\nobject derived from the 2MASS All Sky Data Release Point Source\nCatalogue magnitudes (Skrutskie et al. 1997) where zero-magnitude\nfluxes were taken from Zombeck (1990). The reduced spectra and\n2MASS fluxes are shown in Figs 1(a)\u2013(d).\n3 A NA LY S I S O F T H E DATA\n3.1 Model white dwarf spectra\nFor each object in our collection we have generated a pure-H syn-\nthetic white dwarf spectrum at the effective temperature and surface\ngravity given in Table 2. We have used the latest versions of the\nplane-parallel, hydrostatic, non-local thermodynamic equilibrium\n(non-LTE) atmosphere and spectral synthesis codes TLUSTY (v200;\nHubeny 1988; Hubeny & Lanz 1995) and SYNSPEC (v48; Hubeny\nand Lanz, private communication, ftp:\/tlusty.gsfc.nasa.gov\/\nsynsplib\/synspec). All calculations included a full treatment of line\nblanketing and used a state-of-the-art model H atom incorporating\nthe eight lowest energy levels and one superlevel extending from\nn = 9 to 80, where the dissolution of the high-lying levels was\ntreated by means of the occupation probability formalism of\nHummer & Mihalas (1988), generalized to the non-LTE situation\nby Hubeny, Hummer & Lanz (1994). During the calculation of the\nmodel structure the lines of the Lyman and Balmer series were\ntreated by means of an approximate Stark profile (Hubeny, Lanz\n& Jeffrey 1994) but in the spectral synthesis step detailed profiles\nfor these and the Paschen and Brackett lines were calculated\nfrom the Stark broadening tables of Lemke (1997). The synthetic\nspectral fluxes have been normalized to the V magnitude of the\nrelevant white dwarf (Table 2) and convolved with a Gaussian\nto match the resolution of the SOFI spectra. These are shown\noverplotted on the observed data in Figs 1(a)\u2013(d). It is worth\nnoting here that in the effective temperature regime spanned by\nmost of these white dwarfs, the colours V \u2212 K , J \u2212 H and\nH \u2212 K are rather weak functions of T eff (e.g. Bergeron, Wesemael\n& Beauchamp 1995).\n3.2 Searching for cool companions\nWe have examined in turn each of the plots, Figs 1(a)\u2013(d), top and\nbottom, for significant differences in the overall shape or level be-\ntween the observed and synthetic fluxes which can be consistent with\nthe presence of a cool companion. Additionally, we have searched\nfor specific features in each spectrum typical of the energy distribu-\ntions of M, L or T dwarfs e.g. K I and Na I absorption at 1.25 and\n2.20 \u00b5m, respectively, CH4 or CO at 1.6 and 2.3 \u00b5m, respectively,\nand H2O centred on 1.15, 1.4 and 1.9 \u00b5m. When no convincing\nevidence for such has been found, we have instead added empirical\nmodels for low-mass stellar or substellar objects to the white dwarf\nsynthetic spectrum and compared these composites with the IR data\nto obtain approximate limits on the spectral type of putative cool\ncompanions. The empirical models have been constructed using the\nnear-IR spectra of M, L and T dwarfs presented by McLean et al.\n(2003). In brief, the data have been obtained with the NIRSPEC in-\nstrument on the Keck Telescope, cover the range 0.95\u20132.31 \u00b5m with\na resolution of \u03bb\/\u03b4\u03bb \u223c 2000 and have been flux-calibrated using J,\nH and KS photometric fluxes derived from the 2MASS magnitudes\nas described by McLean et al. (2001). To extend these data out to\n2.4 \u00b5m, our effective red limit, we have appended to them sections of\nCGS4 spectra of late-type dwarfs obtained by Leggett et al. (2001)\nand Geballe et al. (2002). To match the resolutions of the NIRSPEC\nand SOFI spectra we have convolved the former with a Gaussian.\nThe smaller difference in resolution between the SOFI and CGS4\ndata (\u03bb\/\u03b4\u03bb \u223c 600\u2013900) has been neglected.\nThe fluxes of the empirical models have been scaled to a level\nappropriate to a location at d = 10 pc using the 2MASS J magni-\ntude of each late-type object and the polynomial fits of Dahn et al.\n(2002) and Tinney, Burgasser & Kirkpatrick (2003) to the MJ ver-\nsus spectral type for M6\u2013M9 and L0\u2013T8 field dwarfs\/brown dwarfs,\nrespectively. Subsequently, these fluxes have been re-calibrated to\nbe consistent with the distance of each white dwarf as derived from\nmeasured V magnitude and effective temperature and theoretical MV\nand radius from evolutionary models of pure-C core white dwarfs\nwith He and H layer masses of 10\u22122 and 10\u22124 M\u0001, respectively,\n(Wood 1995). Furthermore, in setting limits on the companion spec-\ntral type, the fluxes of the empirical models have been reduced by a\nfactor of 1.4, corresponding to the rms dispersion in the MJ versus\nspectral type relationship of Tinney et al. (2003). Starting with T8\nC\u00a9 2005 RAS, MNRAS 357, 1049\u20131058\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n1052 P. D.

Note that in the bottom plot the features attributable to a putative T8 companion are comparable in size to the H-Paschen\nlines, which are clearly detected and match the model predictions closely.\nwe have progressively added earlier spectral types to the synthetic\nwhite dwarf spectrum, until it could be concluded with reasonable\ncertainty that the presence of a companion of that effective tem-\nperature or greater would have been obvious from our data, given\nthe signal-to-noise (S\/N) ratio. Propagating the typical errors in V ,\nT eff and log g, we find that the uncertainties in the estimated white\ndwarf distances due to measurement errors are of the order of 5\u20136\nper cent and have little impact on the limits we set on the companion\nspectral type. We also note that the systematic errors which may be\npresent in the effective temperatures we have adopted for the hotter\nwhite dwarfs in our study (\u223c10 per cent), arising due to the LTE\nnature (as opposed to non-LTE) of the models used by Marsh et al.\n(1997) and their neglect of metal line blanketing, are in such a way\nthat the limits we place err on the side of conservatism, at least for\nthese white dwarfs.\nTo perform some means of assessment of our spectroscopic cal-\nibration and modelling we have recently obtained, using the same\ntelescope and instrument setup, an HK spectrum of the newly iden-\ntified DA WD+dL binary GD1400 (Farihi & Christopher 2004).\nThese authors have concluded that the 2MASS photometry of\nthis system is most consistent with a companion spectral type\nof L6. Following a similar procedure to that outlined above, us-\ning 2MASS H and KS photometry to calibrate the NTT data and\nadopting the parameters for the white dwarf given in Farihi &\nChristopher (2004), we have compared various combinations of\nsynthetic white dwarf spectrum + low-mass stellar or substellar\nmodel with the observed data. We find that the best match to\nthe data is provided by a WD+L7 model (see Fig. 2) in satis-\nfying agreement with Farihi & Christopher\u2019s estimated spectral\ntype given the uncertainties in their deconvolved near-IR pho-\ntometry. The excellent level of agreement between the shapes\nof the composite model and the observed spectrum (better than\n10 per cent where the S\/N ratio allows) suggests that our data reduc-\ntion and calibration procedures are reasonably robust and supports\nour use of the NIRSPEC data sets as low-mass stellar and substellar\ntemplates.\nC\u00a9 2005 RAS, MNRAS 357, 1049\u20131058\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nNear-IR spectroscopy of DA white dwarfs 1053\nFigure 1 \u2013 continued\n4 R E S U LT S A N D D I S C U S S I O N\n4.1 Do we detect unresolved late-type companions to these\nwhite dwarfs?\nGreen et al. (2000) searched J- and K-band photometry of 47\nextreme-ultraviolet selected degenerates, drawn from the catalogues\nof the EUVE All-Sky and ROSAT Wide Field Camera surveys, for\na 3\u03c3 excess in both bands with respect to the predictions of white\ndwarf models. This led to the identification of 10 marginally resolved\nor unresolved white dwarf + dM systems, half of which were not\npreviously suspected of being composite in nature. A more recent\nanalysis of several hundred white dwarfs drawn from the McCook\n& Sion (1999) catalogue and present in the 2MASS Second Incre-\nmental Point Source Catalogue, has revealed, on the basis of their\nlocation in the J \u2212 H , H \u2212 K colour\u2013colour diagram, 95 candidate\nwhite dwarf + red dwarf binaries, 47 of which were previously un-\nknown (Wachter et al. 2003). We note that GD50 and RE J0457\u2212280\nwere included in both of these photometric surveys and GD659 in\nthe Wachter et al. (2003) study but none of the three were flagged\nas a likely unresolved white dwarf + red dwarf composite.\nNevertheless, the present spectroscopic investigation allows us to\nprobe to cooler spectral types and hence slightly lower masses. For\nexample, by demanding a 3\u03c3 flux excess at J in addition to K, Green\net al. (2000) effectively limit their search to companions with types\nearlier than late-M. Furthermore, using synthetic 2MASS colours\ngenerated from a number of white dwarf and composite white\ndwarf + red dwarf models we have examined the location in the\nJ \u2212 H , H \u2212 K colour\u2013colour diagram of various combinations\nand find that for white dwarfs with effective temperatures and sur-\nface gravities comparable to GD659 and GD71, two of the cooler\nobjects in our collection, the Wachter et al. method would fail to\nunearth companions later than \u223cM9. The limit is even earlier for\nthe hottest white dwarfs studied here (with similar or larger radii).\nHowever, a detailed examination of Figs 1(a)\u2013(d), top and bottom,\nreveals no convincing evidence for the presence of a spatially un-\nresolved cool companion to any of the eight targets of the present\nstudy. Therefore, following the method outlined in the previous sec-\ntion, we have placed the approximate limits given in Table 3 on the\nspectral type of a putative companion to each white dwarf. Subse-\nquently, we have used these limits to constrain the mass of each\nputative companion.\n4.2 Limiting masses to putative late-type companions\nAlthough the cooling age of each white dwarf can be estimated from\ntheoretical evolutionary models (e.g. Wood 1995), we do not know\nwith any certainty the mass and hence lifetime of their progenitors.\nTherefore, we are unwilling to assign an age to the putative associate\nof any of our white dwarfs (i.e. progenitor lifetime + white dwarf\ncooling time). As the effective temperatures of very-low-mass stars\nand substellar objects remain a function of both mass and age at\ntimes of the order gigayears, when using our spectral type limits\nC\u00a9 2005 RAS, MNRAS 357, 1049\u20131058\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n1054 P. D. Dobbie et al.\nFigure 1 \u2013 continued\nto constrain masses, we instead assume a range of ages broadly\nencompassing likely values. We have used the polynomial fit de-\ntailed in table 4 of Golimowski et al. (2004) to assign approximate\neffective temperatures to the spectral type limits shown in Table\n3. Subsequently, we refer to the low-mass stellar\/substellar evolu-\ntionary models for solar metallicity of Baraffe et al. (2003), using\ncubic splines to interpolate between their points, to estimate cor-\nresponding masses at ages 1, 5 and 10 Gyr as shown in Table 3.\nClearly, even for an age comparable to that of the Galactic disc our\nresults argue strongly against the presence of a companion with M \u0002\n0.082 M\u0001 to any of the degenerates in our collection. Indeed, popu-\nlation synthesis models indicate that most of these white dwarfs are\nlikely to be the progeny of local disc F stars (e.g. Aznar Cuadrado\net al. 2004; Schroder, Pauli & Napiwotzki 2004). As the lifetime\nof an F star is \u223c5 Gyr (e.g. de Loore & Doom 1992), and the time\nit takes a DA white dwarf of canonical mass (0.6 M\u0001) to cool to\n12 000 K is \u223c0.5 Gyr, the majority of these objects probably formed\nless than 6 Gyr ago.\n4.3 Overall relevance of results and significance\nto individual objects\nConsidering the typical distances of the white dwarfs in this study\n(\u223c60 pc), the atmospheric conditions at the time the data were ac-\nquired and the width of the instrument slit, the spectroscopic nature\nof our observations renders our study most sensitive to companions\nat\u000160 au from our degenerate primaries. It is probable that the man-\nner in which we have selected our targets, as described in Section 1,\nhas biased our work against systems containing cool dwarfs earlier\nthan mid-M spectral type. The presence of such stars would most\nprobably have been detected as excess red continuum in the opti-\ncal spectrum (e.g. Vennes & Thorstensen 1994) of these relatively\nwell-studied white dwarfs. Hence this work is, in effect, sensitive\nto secondaries of mid-M type and later, which in terms of mass is\nM \u2248 0.15\u20130.08 M\u0001 (Kirkpatrick, Henry & McCarthy 1991; Baraffe\net al. 2003). The spectral types of the 10 cool companions unearthed\nfrom the EUV selected sample of white dwarfs were estimated to\nrange from \u223cM3.5 to M6.5 (M \u2248 0.3\u20130.1 M\u0001; Kirkpatrick et al.\n1991; Green et al. 2000). Neglecting the fact that poorer seeing and\na slightly more distant white dwarf sample probably resulted in their\nphotometric study having some additional sensitivity to companions\nat wider separations, if we assume a mass function for the secondary\nstars of dN\/dM \u221d M\u22121 (e.g. Reid & Gizis 1997), on the basis of\nthe Green, Ali & Napiwotzki result, we can estimate, albeit rather\ncrudely, that we might have expected to detect late-type compan-\nions to approximately one in six of the white dwarfs in the present\ncollection.\nAlthough the small number of white dwarfs in our study has prob-\nably contributed significantly to our failure to detect a late-type sec-\nondary, it has become apparent from the results of detailed radial\nvelocity surveys that there is a deficiency of very-low-mass stel-\nlar and substellar companions to F-, G- and K-type main-sequence\nC\u00a9 2005 RAS, MNRAS 357, 1049\u20131058\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nNear-IR spectroscopy of DA white dwarfs 1055\nFigure 1 \u2013 continued\nTable 2.

Furthermore, our study is sensitive to\ncompanions lying well beyond the typical radius of the envelope of\nan asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star (\u223c1\u20132 au, Schenker, private\ncommunication), even allowing for the change in separation which\nprobably occurs as mass is lost from the white dwarf progenitor. It\ntherefore seems plausible that our search overlaps with the top end\nof the brown dwarf desert in terms of mass and that this may also\nhave had a bearing on the outcome of our search. We note that Farihi\net al. (2003), who are conducting a proper motion survey of white\ndwarfs based on IR imaging, find very few late-M type and cooler\ncompanions, albeit at relatively wide separation (hundreds of au).\nDespite our rather small and disparate collection of targets, it seems\nfair to say that the present results do not contradict previous find-\nings regarding very-low-mass companions to main-sequence stars\nand white dwarfs, i.e. we have not unearthed a previously unrec-\nognized population of late-M and L-type companions to these DA\nwhite dwarfs.\nThese results also have implications for our objects at an individ-\nual level, as several are known to exhibit anomalies in their photo-\nspheric abundance patterns (e.g. GD659) or hydrogen line profiles\n(e.g. WD2359\u2212438):\nGD659. This white dwarf displays an EUV energy distribution\nconsistent with a near pure-H photosphere (e.g. Barstow et al. 1997),\ndespite the presence in the atmosphere of C, N and Si as revealed by\nSTIS and IUE spectroscopy (e.g. Barstow et al. 2003a). However,\ndetailed inspection of the N V line profiles suggests that this ele-\nment is not homogeneously distributed in depth, with the bulk con-\nfined to higher, lower-pressure layers of the photosphere (Barstow\net al. 2003a). According to these authors this high degree of strat-\nification is not predicted by radiative levitation theory. Using our\nnear-IR spectroscopy we are able to rule out that these abundance\nanomalies arise from ongoing accretion of material from an un-\nseen companion of spectral type L6 or earlier. Referring to the\n10-Gyr model of Baraffe et al. (2003) we find that this amounts\nto the exclusion of a (spatially unresolved) stellar companion to\nGD659.\nGD50. The EUVE spectrum of this white dwarf reveals the pres-\nence of photospheric helium at an abundance of log(He\/H) \u2248\n\u22123.6. This cannot be explained in terms of radiative levitation the-\nory, which predicts log(He\/H) \u0001 \u22128.0 for an object of the effec-\ntive temperature and surface gravity of GD50 (Vennes, Bowyer &\nC\u00a9 2005 RAS, MNRAS 357, 1049\u20131058\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nNear-IR spectroscopy of DA white dwarfs 1057\nDupuis 1996). An alternative source for this helium is material being\naccreted into the atmosphere from an unseen low-mass companion.\nHowever, Vennes et al. set a limit of M7\u2013M8 on the spectral type\nof any such object on the basis of I-band photometry. Using our\nnear-IR spectroscopy we are now able to push this limit to spectral\ntype T5, which corresponds to a mass of \u223c69 M Jup at an age of\n10 Gyr. Thus it seems increasingly likely that the presence of he-\nlium in GD50 is in some way related to its unusually large mass\n(M = 1.23 \u00b1 0.05 M\u0001; Marsh et al. 1997), and its possible for-\nmation via a stellar merger (e.g. Guerrero, Garcia-Berro & Isern\n2004).\nRE J0457\u2212280. The IUE spectrum of this white dwarf reveals\nthe presence of C, N and O in the photosphere. However, the steep\ndrop in the EUV flux shortward of 250 \u00c5indicates that Fe (and per-\nhaps Ni too) is also likely to be present in significant quantities.\nSurprisingly, Barstow et al. (2003b) find a much larger discrepancy\nbetween the Lyman- and Balmer-derived effective temperature de-\nterminations, compared with that observed for other DAs of simi-\nlar effective temperature and surface gravity. Despite the 2MASS\nH \u2212 KS colour hinting at the presence of a cool companion this is\nnot confirmed by our near-IR spectroscopy. Instead we rule out an\nunresolved associate of spectral type L3 or earlier, corresponding to\nM \u0002 0.075 M\u0001 at 10 Gyr (Baraffe et al. 2003).\nGD71. The EUV energy distribution of GD71 is consistent with\na near pure-H atmosphere (e.g. Barstow et al. 1997). The co-added\nIUE echelle spectrum provides no convincing evidence from the\npresence of photospheric metals (Holberg, Barstow & Sion 1998).\nFurthermore, the radial velocity of this white dwarf shows no sig-\nnificant variability (Maxted, Marsh & Moran 2000). Thus we have\nno compelling reason to suspect the existence of a very-low-mass\ncompanion. However, on the basis of our near-IR spectroscopy we\nare now able to exclude a (spatially unresolved) stellar companion\nto GD71.\nRE J2214\u2212490. Enhancements in the C, O, Fe and Ni abundances\nin this star with respect to G191\u2212B2B (Barstow et al. 2003a), once\nagain raise the possibility of ongoing accretion from an unseen com-\npanion. However, from the near-IR spectroscopy we can rule out an\nunresolved companion of spectral type M9 or earlier, corresponding\nto M \u0002 0.082 M\u0001 at 10 Gyr (Baraffe et al. 2003). Alternatively,\nincreased equilibrium abundances of these elements may simply\nresult from the slightly larger effective temperature and marginally\nlower surface gravity of the star in comparison with G191-B2B (e.g.\nSchuh, Dreizler & Wolff 2002).\nWD2359\u2212434. This white dwarf is relatively cool (T eff =\n8660 K) and has a high mass (0.95 M\u0001; Aznar Cuadrado et al.\n2004). Koester et al. (1998) reported a very shallow and narrow H\u03b1\nprofile and speculated that a magnetic field might be responsible.\nAznar Cuadrado et al. (2004) indeed detected a weak magnetic field\nof 3.1 kG during their spectropolarimetric survey of bright white\ndwarfs. However, in order to explain the observed profile of the\nH\u03b1 core, one has to invoke a magnetic field with a maximum field\nstrength of >50 kG. Although it cannot be completely ruled out\nthat both observations can be explained by a peculiar and complex\nmagnetic field structure, other explanations have to be explored as\nwell.\nAs a result of the low temperature and the small radius of\nWD 2359\u2212434 we can set quite stringent upper limits on a cool\ncompanion. We derived a limiting spectral type of T8 correspond-\ning to 0.05 M\u0001 for an age of 10 Gyr, i.e. a stellar companion can\nbe ruled out. Warm circumstellar dust causing an infrared excess\nwas detected in the ZZ Ceti star G29\u221238 (Tokunaga, Becklin &\nZuckerman 1990). No sign of such an infrared excess is present in\nour spectrum of WD2359\u2212434, which limits the amount of circum-\nstellar dust which could be present close to the white dwarf.\n5 C O N C L U S I O N S\nOur detailed near-IR spectroscopic study of a collection of eight\npredominantly southern hemisphere DA white dwarfs has failed to\nreveal the presence of any late-type companions. Instead, we have\nplaced approximate limits on the spectral types of putative compan-\nions. These constraints allow us to rule out spatially unresolved low-\nmass stellar associates to GD659, GD50, GD71 and WD2359\u2212434\nand companions with M \u0002 0.082 M\u0001 to any of the remaining stars\nin the collection. These results argue against ongoing accretion of\nmaterial from low-mass companions as the source of the abundance\nanomalies seen in a number of these stars. Furthermore, they can be\nviewed as consistent with the previously reported drop below q \u223c\n0.1\u20130.2 in the mass ratio distribution of binaries with main-sequence\nF-, G-, K- and M-type primaries as determined from detailed radial\nvelocity studies.\nAC K N OW L E D G M E N T S\nThis work is based on observations collected at the European South-\nern Observatory, Chile.
