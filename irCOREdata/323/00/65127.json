Introduction \n \nThe invention and development of agriculture by human communities in the Holocene, \nbased upon the domestication and controlled breeding of plants and animals (Mannion, 1999), is \nthe single most important factor in the transformation of the world\u2019s biophysical systems from \nentirely natural to the situation existing today, when much of the world\u2019s surface is turned over to \nfarming of a few selected food crops at varying degrees of intensity (Diamond, 2002). Despite its \nimportance, however, our understanding of agriculture\u2019s origins and the details (the stimuli, \nmechanisms, environmental context, even dates and locations) of the transition from reliance on \nforaging (culturally Palaeo\/Mesolithic) to reliance on farming (culturally Neolithic) economies \nremains uncertain, particularly for its earlier stages. It is now clear, however, that even in its global \ncore areas where agriculture was conceived, domestication and the switch to Neolithic farming \nwas a gradual, prolonged process rather than a swift, revolutionary event (Pringle, 1988). In the \ncase of cereals, there was a long period of increasingly intensive exploitation before domestication \nwas achieved, starting with the collection and processing of wild cereal grains by foragers (Kislev \net al., 2004; Piperno et al., 2004), then the sowing of the surplus seeds in more convenient \nlocations near settlements and passing into the intentional and increasingly intensive cultivation of \nthese wild cereal forms (Weiss et al., 2006; Willcox et al., 2008) before eventual domestication. In \na few locations the change to cereal cultivation may even have occurred some millennia before the \nstart of the Holocene, perhaps encouraged by Late Glacial environmental change (Hillman et al., \n2001). In all locations the eventual creation of truly domesticated cereal varieties was almost \ncertainly accidental, requiring evolutionary changes in plant genotype and morphology, and arose \nfrom the concentration of wild forms during their cultivation and from the selection of more \nproductive and desirable plants by the cultivators. It follows that dedicated cultivation of wild \ncereals over a long period of time, at least several centuries and probably millennia, was a \nprerequisite for the gradual emergence of domesticated cereals. \n \n1.1 Neolithic rice cultivation in China \n  \nIn the case of rice, the history of its use, cultivation and domestication is long and complex \n(Underhill, 1997; Lu, 1999; Sweeney and McCouch, 2007) and has been the subject of \nconsiderable research and debate. The proposal that China was one of the core areas where rice \n 3 \nagriculture originated (Chang, 1989; Glover and Higham, 1996; Wang and Sun, 1996; Crawford \nand Shen, 1998; Higham and Lu, 1998; Lu, 2006) has been confirmed by modern genetic research \n(Khush, 1997; Londo et al., 2006) that indicates domestication occurred in the south central China \nregion more than once, with the domesticate Oryza sativa (japonica) arising from its wild \nperennial progenitor O. rufipogon. While the timing of these events and specific locations of the \ndomestication centres remain uncertain, there is now strong evidence that the earliest rice \ncultivation and domestication may have occurred in areas of the Yangtze valley (Normile, 1997), \nparticularly its middle basin (Pei, 1998; Zhao, 1998; Zhao and Piperno, 2000; Sato, 2002) but also \nits lower reaches (Yan, 1992; Jiang and Liu, 2006; Fuller et al., 2007). Certainly the collection and \nuse of wild rice by foragers occurred over a very long period in the Yangtze region, at least since \nthe start of the Holocene (Zhao et al., 1995; Higham and Lu, 1998; Yuan, 2002), and probably \nsignificantly before (Zhao et al., 1995). Environmental factors, especially climate, would have \nbeen very influential regarding the availability of thermophilous wild rice to foragers in the \nYangtze valley. It would certainly have been present there in abundance after the \nPleistocene\/Holocene transition, although near the northern limit of its natural range, because of \nthe switch at that time to the favourable environmental conditions of a warm, humid monsoonal \nclimate (Jarvis, 1993; Wang et al., 2005), so favourable that archaeological rice remains from the \nstart of the Holocene have even been recorded in Henan Province well to the north of the Yangtze \n(Chen et al., 1995; Chen and Jiang, 1997; Zhang and Wang, 1998; Hu et al., 2006), in an area \nwhere dryland agriculture is practised today. There are also, however, several pre-Holocene \nrecords of rice remains from archaeological sites, often caves and rock shelters, in the Yangtze \narea (Zhao, 1998) and wild rice must have been present there, although perhaps not in its aquatic \nform, during the Late Pleistocene except for its coldest and driest periods (Lu et al., 2002). The \ngathering of wild rice in quantity, for food and husks for tempering pottery fabric, seems proven at \nthese Lateglacial sites, but claims have also been made that archaic cultivated forms occur even in \nthese very early assemblages (Zhao et al., 1995; Chen, 1998; Zhang, 1999), so that the date and \nenvironmental context of first rice cultivation have been contentious and difficult to establish, as \nremains of wild and cultivated rice are difficult to distinguish. Most Neolithic and even later \n(Itzstein-Davey et al., 2007a) site assemblages include both, as well as transitional forms. Once \nsystematic rice cultivation did begin in the Yangtze valley, as elsewhere, there must have been an \nextended period of cultivation before the morphological changes that signify domesticated rice \n 4 \noccurred. Although there is still strong debate on when this happened (Liu et al., 2007a, b; Fuller et \nal., 2008a), recent examination of rice grains in the lower Yangtze region support a protracted \ncultivation phase of well over a millennium before true domestication occurred as late as 6000 \nyears ago in the middle Neolithic (Fuller et al., 2007, 2008b, 2009). Cultivation of morphologically \nwild varieties was evidently a necessary and lengthy episode in the cultural trajectory towards full \ndomestication and intensive rice farming. Establishing the timing and circumstances of this \nadoption of systematic rice cultivation is therefore of the highest importance. The eastern coastal \nlowlands that include the area of the Yangtze delta (Fig. 1a) are ideal for pursuing this research \naim, containing several very early Neolithic sites (Fig. 1b). These early Neolithic sites range in \ntime from the start of the Holocene c. 10 000 years ago, as at Shangshan where putative cultivation \nhas been recorded (Jiang and Liu, 2006; Liu et al., 2007a), to around 6000 years ago, as at Hemudu \n(Zhao and Wu, 1988; Jiang, 2003; Fuller et al., 2007) where unequivocal domesticated rice \noccurred as part of an assemblage that still included wild and cultivated forms (Tang et al., 1994). \nFarming at Hemudu is suggested by many specialised agricultural implements but significantly \neven at Hemudu rice of all types still remained a minority component of a diverse wild plant food \nresource base (Qin et al., 2006) dominated by acorns and other nuts (Fuller, 2006; Fuller et al., \n2007). Even in the later Neolithic, wild foods remained an important part of rice farmers\u2019 diet \nalong the Yangtze (Zhao, 2005). Certainly, throughout the first half of the Holocene Chinese early \nNeolithic groups of the lower Yangtze appear to have been foragers first and cultivators second. \n \n1.2 Palaeoecology and rice cultivation \n \nWe agree with Fuller et al. (2008a) that multiple lines of evidence will be required to achieve a \ngood understanding of the history of rice agriculture as Oryza archaeobotanical data remain \nambiguous, particularly for the key early stage when systematic rice cultivation was added to rice \ngathering. As well as rice macrofossils, on archaeological sites these data are mainly represented \nby rice phytolith studies (Jiang and Piperno, 1994; Jiang, 1995; Pearsall et al., 1995; Zhao et al., \n1995; Zhao et al., 1998; Wang and Ding, 1999; Zhao and Piperno, 2000) that have become \nincreasingly sophisticated (Zheng et al., 2003; Lu et al., 2006; Itzstein-Davey et al., 2007a). \nUnderstanding of the start of rice cultivation is still hampered, however, by ignorance of the \necological conditions that accompanied it. A few recent studies have added palynology to phytolith \n 5 \nanalysis, to reconstruct the local vegetation in which cultivation took place (Huang and Zhang, \n2000; Yasuda et al., 2004; Itzstein-Davey et al., 2007b), adding an environmental context to \nhuman activity. In this paper we take this further, supplementing pollen and phytolith data with \nseveral other biological proxies, including fungal spores, algae, microcharcoal, diatoms and \nforaminifera, to reconstruct detailed wetland successions, define the precise natural \npalaeoecological context in which rice cultivation began and clarify the environmental changes the \nhuman activity caused. We have chosen Kuahuqiao, a site in the Hangzhou lowlands in the lower \nYangtze region of east China, for the detailed analyses as it contains excavated waterlogged \ncultural sediments with good organic preservation and archaeological context, and clear evidence \nof the earliest rice cultivation in a region where wild rice naturally occurred. Also, the site lies in \nan area that would have been coastal swamp in the earlier Holocene, an ecological zone that has \nbeen proposed (Higham, 1995) as the most likely habitat where earliest rice cultivation took place, \nand an environment that offers the opportunity to integrate a wide range of palaeoecological \nproxies effectively, as shown by Zheng and Li (2000) elsewhere in coastal southeast China. A \nbrief report on our research at Kuahuqiao has been published previously (Zong et al., 2007). \n \n2. The study site \n \nKuahuqiao (30\u00b008\u201942\u201dN and 120\u00b013\u201902\u201dE) is located c. 5 km south of Hangzhou City in \nZhejiang Province (Fig. 1b), and lies at the boundary between the upland region to the south and \nwest and the flat coastal plain around Hangzhou Bay to the east and north. It is situated in a natural \nzone of transition between the fluvial and terrestrial environments upstream of the Qiantang river \nmouth above Hangzhou City and the wetland environments of the coastal lowlands that are today \nlargely given over to intensive paddy rice production. The archaeological site lies in a shallow \ndepression, with ground altitudes around 3.8 m above local mean sea level (the Yellow Sea \ndatum), between two lines of hills (Fig. 1c). Within this basin, the unconsolidated sediment \nsequence comprises a 2-3 m thick grey clay layer at the base, coarsening downwards to incorporate \nsands and gravels, overlain by a layer of brown organic-rich silty clay (Table 1). This is overlain \nby \u2018cultural\u2019 levels comprising highly organic clays that were deposited naturally but which \ninclude abundant plant remains, organic detritus and archaeological material. These are sealed by a \n 6 \nlayer of grey clay up to a metre thick that becomes laminated in its upper part and forms the \ndisturbed topsoil at the surface.  \nMuch of the site was destroyed in the 1970s when the basal clays were dug out and used for \nbrick-making. Parts of the remaining deposits were excavated for the first time in 1990, and again \nin 2001 and 2002 (Fig. 1d), by the Zhejiang Provincial Institute of Cultural Relics and \nArchaeology, with a total area of 1080 m2 investigated (Jiang, 2004). At the centre of the surviving \nsite the cultural layers are at their thickest, about 3 m, where a domestic settlement area was \nlocated, inferred from the distribution of the archaeological finds and primarily by the discovery of \nat least four wooden pile-dwellings during the 1990 excavation (Fig. 1d). These show that the \nsettlement was situated within wet coastal marshland during its period of occupation, confirming \nthe interpretation implied by the character of the cultural sediments themselves, organic clays and \nmud that would have been laid down within sub-aquatic environments, and explaining the survival \nof the cultural layers as waterlogged organic soils as well as the wealth of cultural and organic \nmaterial they contain, well preserved by their waterlogged nature. The cultural layers at Kuahuqiao \nlie more than a metre below present day mean sea level. One of the most important preserved \norganic artefacts that testifies to the aquatic nature of the site is a wooden dugout canoe (Jiang and \nLiu, 2005) made of pine and over 5.5 m long that was recovered from near the northwest edge of \nthe area that was excavated in 2001-02. Other well-preserved organic materials include wooden \npaddles and spades, ladders, worked timbers and adze handles, bamboo and bone implements, and \nfabric matting. The function of the tools made from organic material is not easy to deduce, but \nsome at least appear to be digging implements. These could have been used in constructing the \nearthen walls that were found supporting the pile-dwellings, but could also have had a role in food \nproduction. \nOther archaeological finds from Kuahuqiao (Jiang, 2004) include storage pits and a large \nnumber and range of pottery types that form a previously unrecorded class of ceramic assemblage, \nmostly tempered with charred plants fragments and rice husks. Most significantly, the cultural \norganic soils preserved abundant biological remains. There were a large number of bones from a \nvariety of animals, birds and fish that included some domestic pig and dog but mainly comprised \nwild species (Yuan et al., 2008), suggesting that hunting formed the major faunal element of the \neconomy. Oyster shells were common as were a wide variety of plant remains, particularly nuts, \nfruits and seeds, and in particular acorns that were often found in large numbers in the storage pits. \n 7 \nWild plant species predominated, indicating that gathering, added to fishing and the hunting of \nwild game, formed the staple of a mainly foraging economy with a wide resource base. \nSignificantly, however, more than a thousand rice grains and many rice phytoliths were recovered, \nmostly wild varieties but including large numbers of morphologically advanced but not yet \ndomesticated forms (Zheng et al., 2004). The character of the wild rice harvested at Kuahuqiao \nremains the subject of debate (Pan, 2008; Fuller and Qin, 2008). While primarily a forager \nsettlement exploiting the rich natural resources of the coastal marshes and hinterland, Kuahuqiao \nhas an element of incipient rice cultivation within the resource base which, allied to the limited \npresence of domesticated pigs, the earliest food animal domesticate in China (Yuan and Flad, \n2002), classifies it as very early Neolithic, supported by calibrated radiocarbon dates on the canoe \nof c. 8000 years ago (Jiang and Liu, 2005). Analysis of all the radiocarbon dating results (Jiang, \n2004) for the Neolithic material at Kuahuqiao suggests clearly that occupation of the site began at \nor shortly before 8000 cal BP, although it should be remembered that the studied area is only a \nproportion of the original extent of the site.  \nThe new research data presented in the present paper are from a sediment profile recovered in \n2005 from an exposed section at the eastern edge of the site, where the cultural layer is about 0.5 m \nthick, that had been opened during the 2001-02 excavations (Fig. 1e). The eastern face of trench \nT0512 was sampled at a point about 8 m from where the dugout canoe was found (Fig. 1e). Sub-\nsamples were taken for analysis through the full sediment sequence at no more than 5 cm vertical \nincrements, closing to 1 cm intervals through most of the cultural layers. Although much \narchaeological material was recovered, no pile-dwellings or other evidence of domestic activity \nand settlement were found during the 2001-02 excavation. This location on the periphery of the \nsite was chosen for the present study in order to make palaeoecological reconstruction more \nreliable, as the sediments there, being about 100 m away from the domestic settlement area in the \ncentral part of the site, would be much less likely to have been disturbed during the occupation. \nThe absence of any sediment mixing and stratigraphic disturbance at the sampled section is \nconfirmed by the very good chronological series formed by the radiocarbon dates through the \nsequence. The stratigraphic integrity of the cultural deposits will have been protected from \nsubsequent disturbance by the sealing layer of clay that extends to the current surface. The \nsampled section would still have been close enough to the locations of human activity to record its \nenvironmental effects clearly, however. A multi-core study (Waller, 1998) would have been \n 8 \nnecessary to reconstruct fully the vegetational and palaeoenvironmental history of the marshland \nlandscape around Kuahuqiao but this is not the purpose of this research and so such a study has not \nbeen undertaken. Single-core studies elsewhere in the Taihu region (Okuda et al., 2003; Atahan et \nal., 2008) have provided high-quality information regarding geographical changes and human \nactivity. \nThe single core that is presented in this paper, its location carefully selected to maximise \nrecovery of evidence for both human activity and natural processes, is sufficient to answer the \nresearch question: the timing and nature of the start of rice cultivation. This began at our studied \nprofile at c. 7750 cal BP (Table 2). Several of the previously published (Jiang, 2004) radiocarbon \ndates from Kuahuqiao, however, show that people were present at the site for a few centuries \nbefore that time, from c. 8000 cal BP, as exemplified by the dugout canoe dates already mentioned \nabove. While rice cultivation in the wider Taihu region at this earlier date is considered possible by \nother authors (Zhang et al., 2004), none of the several other radiocarbon dates on cultural contexts \nfrom the Kuahuqiao excavations may be interpreted as indicating rice cultivation elsewhere on the \nsite before the starting date in our profile of c. 7750 cal BP. As the available chronological and \narchaeological evidence stands, therefore, it seems that the earlier cultural phases at Kuahuqiao \nrecord settlement and foraging activities only, and that the profile presented in this paper \nrepresents the earliest known Neolithic rice cultivation at the site. \n \n3. Materials and methods \n \nSamples were prepared for palynological analysis using standard laboratory techniques, including \nalkali digestion, sieving at 180 \u03bcm, hydrofluoric acid digestion and acetolysis (Moore et al., 1991), \nand were stained before mounting on microscope slides. These techniques have been shown not to \naffect the preservation of other microfossil types adversely, such as fungal spores (Clarke, 1994). \nMicrofossils (i.e. all palynomorphs <180 \u03bcm in size) were identified using standard reference keys \nand type slides and were counted using a Nikon stereomicroscope at magnifications of x400, using \nx600 oil immersion lenses for identification of critical features. Exotic Lycopodium spores were \nadded in known volume as a marker before processing, allowing the calculation of palynomorph \nconcentrations and influx rates. Standard reference sources were used for identification of pollen \ngrains (Wang et al., 1995) and pteridophyte spores (Zhang et al., 1990). A minimum sum of 200 \n 9 \nland pollen grains was counted at each sampled level, as well as all the aquatic pollen, \npteridophyte and bryophyte spores observed while attaining that sum, after which slide scanning \ncontinued for rare or indicator types and to confirm the presence or absence of cultigen pollen. \nOak pollen grains have been differentiated into Quercus (deciduous, including Lepidobalanus) and \nCyclobalanopsis (evergreen) forms using published keys and photographs (Chang and Wang, \n1986; Jarvis et al., 1992). Gramineae (grass) pollen has been divided into two size classes in order \nto differentiate grains likely to be of cereal (Oryza) type (40 \u03bcm and above) from other wild \ngrasses (<40 \u03bcm), following Wang et al. (1995) and Chatuvedi et al. (1998), and as adopted by \nprevious investigators, e.g. Atahan et al. (2008). Microscopic charcoal particles (microcharcoal) \nwere counted upon the microscope slides relative to the standard pollen sum, providing a \npollen\/microcharcoal ratio. Microcharcoal particles of about 30 \u03bcm in diameter comprised the basic \nmeasurement unit, which is similar to the spores of the introduced marker exotic Lycopodium \nclavatum (Stockmarr, 1971). Microcharcoal particles were numbered by size relative to this basic 30 \n\u03bcm unit, as described by Innes and Simmons (2000). Unless very tiny, particles less than 30 \u03bcm in \nsize could be aggregated to form the basic unit. Separate curves for the different microscopic size \nranges are not presented, as fragmentation of particles must have occurred in the pollen preparation \nprocess. Most particles counted were of the smaller size ranges. \nDiatom counts were also made throughout the profile. The technical procedures for diatom \nanalysis follow those described by Palmer and Abbott (1986). A minimum count of 300 diatom \nvalves was reached for the majority of samples, and all diatoms are identified to species level (e.g. \nvan der Werff and Huls, 1958-1966; Jin et al., 1982). Taxa are classified according to an halobian \nsystem based on salinity tolerances (Vos and de Wolf, 1993). Rice phytolith counts were made \nfrom the diatom slides and are shown as numbers counted, but are not separated into likely wild \nand likely domestic varieties. Full phytolith analyses have been completed and published \nelsewhere (Jiang, 2004; Zheng et al., 2004, 2007) and are not repeated here. Other non-pollen \npalynomorphs (NPPs), mainly comprising fungal spores and remains of algae and invertebrates, \nwere also recorded with at least 100 identified on the pollen slides at each counted level. \nTaxonomic identification of NPPs was achieved where possible, but otherwise they were identified \nto van Geel\u2019s catalogue of provisional type numbers, using the illustrations and descriptions \npublished in several papers (e.g. van Geel, 1978, 1986, 2001; van Geel and Aptroot, 2006; van \nGeel et al., 2003). The corresponding fungal catalogue type number is shown after the first \n 10 \nmention of a taxon in the text and on the figures in all cases. NPP frequencies are shown as \npercentages of the total land pollen sum. Radiocarbon dates are AMS determinations on small \norganic fragments or charcoal, except for the two radiometric dates on bulk organic sediment that \nwere published by Jiang (2004) and are relevant to the studied profile. Dates were calibrated using \nprogram Calib5.1 (Stuiver et al., 1998). Microfossil diagrams have been constructed using the \nTILIA programme (Grimm, 1993). \n \n 4. Results and interpretation \nFull details of the nine AMS 14C dates obtained for this study are shown in Table 2. Two \nradiometric dates are also shown which were published as part of the original excavation of the site \n(Jiang, 2004) and which dated respectively the end the deposition of the lower clay and the onset \nof that of the upper clay at the site, so bracketing the more organic sequence. The calibrated age \nranges of all the AMS dates are narrow and the central calibrated age of all the dates is shown on \nthe microfossil diagrams. Most dates are clustered within the half metre of the profile that includes \nthe cultural soil layers and show that these cultural units accumulated very quickly. They form a \nvery good consistent series that provides a precise chronological framework for the period of \nhuman activity at the site. This is despite the propensity for dates on alluvial sediment to yield \nanomalous results because of the incorporation of material reworked and transported by fluvial \naction from areas away from the site of deposition. Such dating effects have been reported from \nthe Yangtze system (Stanley and Chen, 2000; Stanley and Hait, 2000) and from the Hangzhou \nlowlands (Atahan et al., 2008). But the Kuahuqiao site, despite its closeness to the head of a \nsignificant river estuary, appears to have escaped such adulteration, because its sheltered location \nand its deposition as an organic marsh soil rather than as natural alluvial accumulation comprising \nmaterial eroded from higher in the catchment. Major soil destabilisation and erosion after intensive \ncatchment deforestation, necessary for the creation of large reservoirs of stored alluvial sediment \nin the river valleys of the Yangtze delta region, did not occur until much later, in the Iron Age \n(Atahan et al., 2007). The consistency of the dating series, allowing for age range overlaps, \nsupports the reliability not only of the chronology but also therefore of the biostratigraphy, an \nimportant requirement for high-resolution palaeoecological studies. \nThe full microfossil data from Kuahuqiao are presented in a series of diagrams, all of which \nshow the seven main sedimentary units that have been identified at the site as reflecting major \n 11 \nchanges in depositional environment or archaeological context (Jiang, 2004; Zong et al., 2007), \nassisting inter-diagram correlation.  The sequence of sedimentary units is: basal grey clay (up to \n157.5 cm), organic brown-grey clay (157.5-113 cm), highly organic brown clay which is \nequivalent to the lower cultural layer (113-90.5 cm), slightly organic grey clay (90.5-88 cm), \nhighly organic brown clay which is separated into the middle cultural layer (88-80.5 cm) and the \nupper cultural layer (80.5-71.5 cm) and upper grey clay (above 71.5 cm). Of these, the slightly \norganic grey clay in mid-profile is the only one not to extend across the entire site, being confined \nto the area around the sampled profile. The tree, shrub and herb pollen frequencies are shown on \nFig. 2, as well as aquatic pollen, pteridophyte and bryophyte spores and microcharcoal, all \ncalculated as percentages of the total land pollen sum. The non-pollen palynomorph frequencies \nare shown on Fig. 3, with the microcharcoal curve as percentages of total NPPs included. Full \ndiatom frequencies are presented on Fig. 4, with diatom summary curves and foraminiferal data on \nFig. 5. Oryza phytolith counts are shown on Fig. 6, which is a conspectus diagram that includes the \nmost diagnostic microfossil curves, some of which are composite and combine ecologically similar \ntaxa, and upon which is also described the sequence of palaeoenvironmental conditions at the site. \nBased primarily upon the pollen data, but informed by the other proxy data records, eleven \nmicrofossil assemblage zones (Kua-1 to Kua-11) are recognised and applied to all the diagrams. \nZone boundaries do not always correspond with the sedimentary unit boundaries. The dates of \nzone boundaries are interpolated between the radiocarbon dated horizons\u2019 central calibrated ages. \nThe interpretation of the Kuahuqiao palaeoecological data that are described below requires \nsome consideration of the taphonomy of the microfossil assemblages and their environment of \ndeposition, as these will have varied during the accumulation of the sediment profile. That all the \nsedimentary units described in Table 1 comprise silts and clays, of varying organic content, shows \nthat deposition took place in aquatic environments throughout the Holocene history of the site, \nwith varying water depth and quality, and differing vegetation communities, at different times. The \nanalysed profile, apart from estuarine clays at its lower and upper limits, comprises sediments laid \ndown within perimarine freshwater coastal marshes, a complex wetland ecotype that can include a \nwide variety of habitats and environments within a small spatial area (van der Woude, 1983), all of \nwhich contain biological communities constantly changing under the influences of autogenic \nhydroseral successions and external factors (Waller et al., 1999). Such marshes predominantly \ncomprise fen systems, with a mosaic of pool, reedswamp, sedge fen and fen-carr vegetation, all of \n 12 \nwhich provide differing source areas (Waller, 1998) for the local components of the pollen \nassemblage preserved in each horizon in a marsh profile like Kuahuqiao. Changes in the size of the \nwetland and in plant community structure will have changed local source areas and caused changes \nin the proportions of pollen derived from the various elements of the wetland vegetation (Waller et \nal., 2005).  In the case of Kuahuqiao, the site also would have had a considerable input of extra-\nlocal pollen derived from vegetation, mainly trees and shrubs, growing on the substantial areas of \nhigher, dry ground around the wetland (Fig. 1c), as well as a more regional tree component from \nfurther away. It is such extra-local and regional dry ground components (Binney et al., 2005) that \nprovide information regarding woodland changes governed by climate, whereas the local wetland \nelement provides data on any hydroseral and sea-level changes. Human impacts are likely to be \nrecorded in both the local and extra-local components of the pollen record, depending on their \nscale and location. The sources of the microfossil data recorded at Kuahuqiao have been taken into \naccount in the interpretation and discussion of environmental changes at the site. \n \n4.1 Microfossil data \n \nZone Kua-1 (below 157.5 cm; before c. 9021 cal BP) is characterised by arboreal pollen, \nprimarily deciduous Quercus, the evergreen taxa Cyclobalanopsis and Castanopsis\/Lithocarpus, \nand Pinus. Also present but in lower values are Ulmus\/Zelkova, Liquidambar, Castanea, Carpinus, \nCupressaceae and Pterocarya. Prominent among the non-tree pollen types are Cyperaceae and the \nsmaller size division of the Gramineae. Artemisia and Chenopodiaceae (which includes \nAmaranthus-type) are the only other significant herb taxa, the latter in particular likely to be of \nsaltmarsh origin. Most abundant among the non-pollen palynomorphs are fungal spores of the \nSordariaceae (55A) and Coniochaeta cf. ligniaria (172), both general decomposers and not \nspecifically diagnostic. Several NPPs indicative of shallow water conditions occur, including Type \n128, the alga Spirogyra (130) and the cyanobacterium Gloeotrichia (146). Most important are high \nfrequencies of Type 705 (Bakker and van Smeerdijk, 1982), the presence of the acritarchs \nMichrystridium (115) and Cymatiosphaera (116) and Operculodinium dinoflagellate cysts (704A), \nall of which indicate intertidal sedimentation. This is supported by the diatom data from this zone, \ndominated by a wide range of salt-tolerant marine (polyhalobous) and estuarine (mesohalobous) \n 13 \nforms of which Nitzschia granulata and N. hungarica are the most abundant. A tidal flat or lower \nsaltmarsh depositional environment is indicated for the clay of Kua-1. \nZone Kua-2 (157.5-142 cm; c. 9021 - c. 8690 cal BP) is characterised by an arboreal pollen \nassemblage very similar to that of the previous zone, although frequencies of the main taxa are \nreduced. Differences include the presence of a much wider range of tree and shrub types, with the \nappearance of several taxa like Betula, Salix and Moraceae in low values. Herb pollen taxa remain \ndominated by Cyperaceae and small Gramineae, the latter rising gradually through the sub-zone. \nArtemisia values are consistent but Chenopodiaceae frequencies are much reduced from those of \nKua-1. Freshwater aquatic pollen increase in diversity with Myriophyllum, Potamogeton and \nespecially Typha prominent. Pteridophyte spores of freshwater wetland like Equisetum and \nOsmunda also rise. A switch from an intertidal to a shallow freshwater depositional environment is \nindicated. This is clearly shown in the diatom flora, with halophyte taxa removed from the record \nand replaced by a high diversity of freshwater forms. Non-pollen palynomorphs agree with this \ninterpretation and add ecological precision. Algal taxa are particularly sensitive to changes in \nwater conditions (Chmura et al., 2006). Gloeotrichia and Spirogyra are consistently important, \nindicating shallow open water, as do peaks for the fungal spore Type 121 and the alga \nBotryococcus (766), but other taxa suggest it was warm, eutrophic and also vegetated, shown \n(Haas, 1996) by peak values for oocytes of the Neorhabdocoela flatworm Gyratrix hermaphroditus \n(353A). Fungal type 11, recorded as specific to cyperaceous plants (van Geel, 1978) also occurs, \nsuggesting the presence of sedges in situ around the sampling point, and this is supported by peaks \nin fungal spores which are associated (van Geel et al., 1981) with sedge fen environments (Type \n306) or fen-reedswamp (Type 708). Increasing spore frequencies of the ascomycete fungi \nCercophora (112) and Chaetomium (7A), decomposers of plant cellulose (van Geel, 2001; van \nGeel and Aptroot, 2006), also point to increasing levels of vegetation in the local aquatic system. \nOryza phytoliths occur in very low numbers throughout this sub-zone (Fig. 6). \nZone Kua-3 (142-122 cm; c. 8690 - c. 8120 cal BP) is characterised by the same major taxa \nas the lower zones, Quercus, Cyclobalanopsis and Castanopsis\/Lithocarpus, and by a similar \nrange of less prominent tree and shrub types. Carpinus and Hamamelidaceae become significant. \nSmall Gramineae pollen dominate the herb assemblage with subsidiary curves for Cyperaceae, \nArtemisia and Typha. Many semi-aquatic wetland herb types occur in low values, including \naquatics Potamogeton, Nuphar, Nelumbo, Iris and Typha latifolia, and likely marsh herbs like \n 14 \nLabiatae and Liliaceae. A denser, shallower-water form of reedswamp and succession to marsh\/fen \nplant communities is recorded. The diatom flora is almost entirely freshwater, and similar to that \nof the previous sub-zone, with a few taxa, particularly Navicula lacustris, Gomphonema \nacuminatum, Eunotia tenella and Pinnularia microstauron, most abundant. Interestingly, the \nhalophobous form Frustulia rhomboides is common only in this sub-zone, highlighting the very \nlow salinity levels during this period. The NPPs support the interpretation of shallow water, shown \nby increases in spores of the green algae Zygnemataceae (van Geel, 2001; van Geel and Grenfell, \n1996) which inhabit shallow standing water and waterlogged soils. Frequencies for Zygnema (58) \nand Mougeotia (313) from this family are highest in this sub-zone, while Botryococcus remains \nimportant. NPPs that indicate standing water and eu- to mesotrophic helophyte marsh habitats, \nTypes 123, 404, 715 and Persiciospora (124), occur in this sub-zone, while taxa that prefer more \nopen water, like Gloeotrichia and Type 128, decline. Gradual increases in Coniochaeta cf. \nligniaria, Sordariaceae spores and Chaetomium, and the appearance of Gelasinospora cf. retispora \n(2), imply dense marsh\/fen vegetation and terrestrialisation. Oryza phytoliths are still recorded in \nvery low numbers throughout this sub-zone. \nZone Kua-4 (122-115.5 cm; c. 8120 - c. 7828 cal BP) is characterised by small but \nsignificant increases in pollen frequency of several woody taxa, or their first appearance. Salix is \nmost increased, but many other shrub types including Rutaceae, Myrsinaceae, Celtis, \nHamamelidaceae, Moraceae, Acer and Nyssa increase, as well as several tree taxa including \nCastanea, Cyclobalanopsis and Liquidambar. A slight increase in Typha percentages occurs but \nsmall Gramineae remains the only well represented herb pollen type. Wet fen-carr seems to be the \nhabitat represented in this sub-zone, for NPPs indicative of wet conditions are still dominant, with \na peak in Type 708 for example, but fungal taxa like Coniochaeta xylariispora (6), Chaetomium, \nPodospora (368) and Types 12 and 324 suggest an increase in drier habitats. The diatom flora is \nstill heavily dominated by freshwater forms, but the start of slight but continuous curves for a few \nmesohalobous taxa, for example Amphora coffeaeformis and Cyclotella striata, and the decline of \nthe halophobe form Frustulia rhomboides, make a slight brackish water influence feasible. Oryza \nphytoliths are still recorded in very low numbers throughout this sub-zone. \nZone Kua-5 (115.5-113 cm; c. 7828 \u2013 c. 7752 cal BP) is defined by the sharp rise in Alnus \npollen frequencies to almost 50% of total land pollen, causing relative falls in the percentages of \nalmost all other pollen taxa. Exceptions are the occurrence of Araliaceae and the start of a \n 15 \nconsistent curve for Corylus\/Ostrya. The development of a local dense alder carr vegetation seems \nnecessary to account for such high frequencies, and fungal spores that indicate woody, carr-type \nvegetation are also well represented at this horizon, primarily Coniochaeta cf. retispora and \nChaetomium but also the appearance of Hypoxylon argillaceum (327) and Spadicoides bina (98), \nobligate wood decomposers. Little change occurs in the ecological signal of the diatom flora, \nalthough a clear change in the assemblage occurs with the rise to high values of Cyclotella \nglomerata coinciding with a major decline in Eunotia tenella across this sub-zone. The number of \nOryza phytoliths recorded increases and, as other indicators of human presence such as Gramineae \npollen grains >40 \u03bcm (likely to be Oryza) and ova of the parasitic worm Trichuris (531) are \nrecorded, some low level human activity may be represented here. \nZone Kua-6 (113-94 cm; c. 7752 - c. 7607 cal BP) is characterised by the fall to very low \nfrequencies of Alnus pollen and the rise to almost 60% of total land pollen of small Gramineae. \nMost other tree taxa percentages also fall, including Quercus, Cyclobalanopsis, \nCastanopsis\/Lithocarpus, Liquidambar, Ulmus\/Zelkova and Hamamelidaceae, while Carpinus, \npreviously significant, ceases to be recorded. Gramineae >40 \u03bcm percentages increase markedly \nand a consistent curve for the disturbance indicator Plantago begins. Other herb pollen likely to \nrepresent weeds of open or disturbed ground include Compositae, Polygonum and Cruciferae. \nMicrocharcoal frequencies, previously very low, rise sharply to very high values. Trichuris forms a \nconsistently high curve and other NPPs indicative of disturbance or cultural activity increase, \nincluding Podospora, Type 574 and Glomus (207) a fungal indicator of disturbed soils. These data \nare in accord with the archaeological designation of this unit as of cultural origin, and the number \nof Oryza phytoliths counted in this zone is substantial (Fig. 6). Reedswamp NPP frequencies, \nparticularly of fungal Types 306 and 708, increase sharply, matching the rise in small Gramineae. \nThe diatom flora is still dominated by freshwater forms, with Cyclotella glomerata, Synedra acus \nand Navicula lanceolata prominent. A few valves of salt-tolerant taxa are recorded consistently, \nhowever, particularly Cyclotella striata, Amphora coffeaeformis, Achnanthes brevipes and \nNitzschia granulata, and there must have been some slight brackish-water influence to allow these \nestuarine or saltmarsh forms to join the assemblage. There are no marine taxa except for a very \nlow but regular presence of Paralia sulcata, which is often the only polyhalobous marine \nplanktonic form found within such dominantly freshwater environments in coastal-fringe locations \n(Zong, 1997). \n 16 \nZone Kua-7 (94-90.5 cm; c. 7607 - c. 7602 cal BP) is characterized by a rise in the \nfrequencies of arboreal pollen, with Quercus, Cyclobalanopsis, Liquidambar, \nCastanopsis\/Lithocarpus and Ulmus\/Zelkova all increased. Several shrub taxa, including Acer, \nAlnus, Oleaceae and Celtis, also rejoin the assemblage. Microcharcoal values fall sharply, both \nGramineae size classes are significantly reduced and disturbed ground weed pollen and cultural \nNPPs also cease to be recorded. A decline in disturbance activity occurred, resulting in some \nlimited woodland regeneration. Some increased wetness is recorded, with small peaks in NPP \nalgae Types 128 and Spirogyra, and the rise in Chenopodiaceae pollen supports the diatom data in \nsuggesting a brackish element to the wetland. Unlike most probable indicators of activity, Oryza \nphytolith numbers do not decline, so perhaps are referable to wild rice in this zone. \nZone Kua-8 (90.5-81 cm; c. 7602 - c. 7592 cal BP) includes the thin clay unit in the \nstratigraphy that separates the lower and middle cultural layers. Tree pollen values fall through the \nfirst half of this zone, particularly Cyclobalanopsis and Castanopsis\/Lithocarpus, although \nQuercus frequencies are maintained until late in the zone when signs of intense human activity are \npresent and they fall sharply. At that point Oryza-type Gramineae pollen reaches a peak with \nweeds of disturbed ground including Ranunculaceae, Rumex, Plantago, Polygonum, Apiaceae and \nCruciferae. Secondary shrubs like Acer, Betula and Corylus\/Ostrya increase after disturbance. \nPercentages of small Gramineae pollen and microcharcoal peak, while Typha frequencies rise \nthrough the zone to abundance near its end. Cultural NPPs mirror the pollen data, with Trichuris \nworm ova, Chaetomium, Type 406 and Sordariaceae (55B) all greatly enhanced. The curves for \npossible halophyte pollen Artemisia and Chenopodiaceae remain low but steady. Figs. 4 and 5 \nshow that the low but consistent influence of salt-tolerant diatoms is maintained in this zone, with \ntrue polyhalobous forms Biddulphia rhombus and Paralia sulcata present with several estuarine \ntypes. Freshwater forms still account for over 80% of the assemblage, however. \nZone Kua-9 (81-79 cm; c. 7600 cal BP) is a very brief period of limited regeneration when \nindicators of disturbance and activity fall and tree pollen frequencies rise slightly. Pollen \npercentages of both Gramineae size classes, disturbed ground weeds and Typha fall, and \nmicrocharcoal frequencies are much reduced. The fall in Trichuris values is pronounced. Quercus, \nBetula, Carpinus, Castanopsis\/Lithocarpus, Acer, Cupressaceae, Salix and Taxodiaceae all \nincrease, as do NPPs associated with woody vegetation, including Type 122 and Coniochaeta \n 17 \nxylariispora. Fig. 5 suggests a slight replacement of freshwater diatoms by mildly salt-tolerant \nforms, but the fluctuations are too small to be reliable. \nZone Kua-10 (79-71.5 cm; c. 7600 - c. 7500 cal BP) is characterised by the return to higher \nfrequencies of both small Gramineae and Oryza-type Gramineae grains, along with Typha and the \nfull range of disturbed ground weeds Plantago, Polygonum, Cruciferae Ranunculaceae and Rumex. \nPteridium also increases, as does microcharcoal initially. Oryza phytolith numbers are the highest \nof the diagram. A return to significant levels of activity is recorded, although reductions in \nfrequencies of tree and shrub taxa are slight, with some, like Cupressaceae, Acer, Alnus and \nPterocarya, increasing. NPPs signifying disturbance and human activity, Trichuris, Chaetomium, \nSordariaceae Type 55B, Podospora and Glomus, all increase. Notable are peaks for Types 159 and \n406, with uncertain ecological affinities. The waterlogged nature of the surface is shown by \nconsistent curves for Potamogeton pollen, Zygnema algae and fungal spore Types 12, 90 and 159. \nThe diatom flora is characterized by the gradual replacement of freshwater taxa by mesohalobous \nand polyhalobous estuarine forms, as marine influence steadily increased. \nZone Kua-11 (71.5-64 cm; c. 7500 - c. 7000 cal BP) records increases in many tree and \nshrub pollen types. Indicators of human activity are no longer recorded, with Oryza phytoliths \nentirely absent. Small Gramineae and Typha frequencies remain substantial, and pollen \npercentages of probable halophytes Artemisia and Chenopodiaceae rise. The presence of \nCompositae pollen grains of Youngia type may also signify saltmarsh environments. Marine \nindicators among the NPPs include acritarchs Micrhystridium and Cymatiosphaera, dinocyst \nOperculodinium and Type 705. These records agree well with the main microfossil change of this \nzone, the major switch from a dominantly freshwater diatom assemblage to one restricted to \nhalophyle forms, with a wide range of mesohalobous estuarine and polyhalobous marine types. \nCommon taxa include Nitzschia granulata, Achnanthes brevipes, Actinoptychus senarius and \nCoscinodiscus obscurus. This continues the trend from the previous zone. Above the zone \nboundary, estuarine foraminifera occur (Fig. 5), mainly Ammonia beccarii and Elphidium advenum \nsuggesting increasing salinity. \n \n5. Discussion \n \n 18 \nCulturally, the Kuahuqiao site lies in the early stages of the transition between the hunting and \ngathering strategy of Mesolithic foragers and the food-production economy of Neolithic farmers. It \nis therefore vital for understanding the change from sedentary foraging, as at Shangshan, c.  100 \nkm south of Kuahuqiao, where pottery pastes are found tempered with charred plants including \nrice husks and dated to c. 10,000 to 8000 cal BP (Jiang and Liu, 2006), to full domestication as at \nHemudu, c. 200 km east of Kuahuqiao, where a large quantity of rice grains and husks have been \nfound and dated to between c. 7000 and 6000 cal BP (Crawford and Shen, 1998; Jiang, 2003). \nKuahuqiao is a classic site for studying the adoption of pre-domestication rice cultivation in east \nChina. The several forms of independent but complementary proxy data described above allow a \ndetailed reconstruction of palaeoecological change at the site and the placement of the early \nNeolithic settlement and land-use there into a secure palaeoenvironmental context.  \n \n5.1 Vegetation history and climate \n \nThe pollen diagram from Kuahuqiao records almost two thousand years of vegetation \nhistory of which the first half, zones Kua-1 to Kua-4, corresponds to the natural local and regional \nvegetation successions before human interference began at the site. There are several published \npollen profiles from the lower Yangtze region with which it can be compared (Liu et al., 1992; \nWang et al., 1995; Xu et al., 1996; Tao et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2005; Yi et al., 2006; Shu et al., \n2007) as well as more general regional syntheses for east China (Liu, 1988; Sun and Chen, 1991; \nRen and Beug, 2002; Zhang et al., 2005; Ren, 2007) and national climate records (Shi et al., 1993; \nZheng et al., 2004; Feng et al., 2006). The Hangzhou\/lower Yangtze area lies near the boundary \nbetween the temperate broadleaf forest biome of northeast China and the sub-tropical evergreen \nforest biome of the southeast, and so the mixed deciduous\/evergreen forests there are very \nsensitive to climate change due to shifts in the strength and influence of the summer monsoon (Yu \net al., 2002; Morrill et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2005). The pollen data from this area show that at the \nstart of the Holocene the monsoon strengthened and dominated climate in east China, producing \nwarm, wet conditions which continued until about 9000 cal BP, when weakening of the monsoon \nbrought cooler and drier weather to the region. This persisted until about 7600 cal BP (Chen et al., \n2005; Yi et al., 2003, 2006), when the re-establishment of strong monsoonal dominance initiated \nvery warm and wet \u2018mid-Holocene optimum\u2019 or \u2018megathermal\u2019 climate that lasted for the next few \n 19 \nmillennia until about 6000 cal BP (An et al., 2000; Yasuda et al., 2004). These dates and climate \nfluctuations in the study area agree well with environmental data from other regions of southeast \nChina (Zheng and Li, 2000). The two warm and humid phases were characterised by sub-tropical \nevergreen trees, particularly Cyclobalanopsis and Castanopsis\/Lithocarpus, whereas during the \nearly Holocene cooling phase after c. 9000 cal BP these decline and temperate deciduous trees, \nparticularly Quercus (Lepidobalanus), become dominant and other cool climate trees like Pinus \nbecome significant. At Kuahuqiao, pollen zones Kua-1 to Kua-4 fall exactly within the time-frame \nof this regional cooler, less humid period before 7600 cal BP. Although Cyclobalanopsis pollen \nfrequencies probably underestimate actual tree representation (Yu et al., 2004), as deciduous \nQuercus is more abundant than the evergreen trees in these zones, with a consistent Pinus curve \nalso present, the Kuahuqiao data agree well with the regional climatic and vegetational evidence \nfor this period. The fact that the Kuahuqiao canoe and several other wooden artifacts recovered \nduring the archaeological excavation (Jiang, 2004) were made from pine wood strongly suggests \nlocal growth of Pinus in the early phases of the occupation. The coldest part of this cool phase is \nlikely to correspond to the global 8200 cal BP climatic deterioration event that has been recognised \nin China (Wang et al., 2005). This would correspond to the end of zone Kua-3 at Kuahuqiao but, \nalthough it is noteworthy that Closterium algae, which prefer colder waters, are only present just \nabove this level, there is no real evidence for cooling at this point in the profile. \nWhile regionally the period after c. 7600 cal BP saw a return to warm, wet climate that \nfavoured the expansion of sub-tropical evergreen trees, climatic effects on forest history at \nKuahuqiao are obscured by the impact of human activity on the vegetation, which may have \nincluded some limited forest disturbance at least in zone Kua-6, and by greatly increased pollen \nproduction by local wetland herb communities. The evergreen trees do increase in frequency at the \nexpense of deciduous Quercus, however, and so Kuahuqiao conforms to the regional megathermal \npattern. Throughout the profile the locality remained well wooded, as tree and shrub pollen is \ncontinually around 70% of total land pollen except in zone Kua-6 where the expansion of local \ngrassland communities reduces it to about 40%.  \n \n5.2 Site hydrology \n \n 20 \n The use of several types of biological proxy data at Kuahuqiao has meant that a detailed \nappraisal of hydrological changes there has been possible, and this has proved critical to \nunderstanding of the site\u2019s sedimentary and palaeoecological history, and so also its human \nexploitation. Sea-level change was clearly a defining factor in the site\u2019s hydrological history, as its \nnatural and cultural organic sediments are intercalated within thick deposits of marine clay. Sea \nlevel rose rapidly on the eastern China coast in the first Holocene millennium (Zhang and Zhao, \n1990; Chen and Stanley, 1998; Zong, 2004) until the present Yangtze Delta\/Hangzhou Bay area \nwas inundated and the Yangtze delta began to form, demonstrated by shallow marine and intertidal \nfacies there of early Holocene age (Wu, 1983; Yan and Hong, 1987; Chen et al., 2000; Li et al., \n2000; Wang et al., 2006). In places marine environments penetrated landward of the present coast \nalong inlets and incised valleys (Yan and Huang, 1987; Hori et al., 2001, 2002), as at Kuahuqiao. \nRecent research (Bird et al., 2007) has shown that the rate of eustatic sea-level rise slowed \nconsiderably in the period between c. 8000 and c. 7500 cal BP allowing vegetation colonising the \nnewly stabilised coastal fringes due to high rates of sedimentation. At Kuahuqiao and similar sites \non the eastern China coast (Zheng and Li, 2000), estuarine depositional environments were \nreplaced by freshwater marshes and lagoons within which more organic sediments accumulated. \nThe switch at Kuahuqiao from intertidal sedimentation to open freshwater suggests that the site \nbecame isolated from marine influence rapidly (Fig. 5). There followed several centuries of \norganic clay deposition and shallowing of freshwater levels within the reedswamp and marsh \nenvironments at Kuahuqiao, as hydroseral vegetation succession progressed. Eventually water \nlevels fell sufficiently to allow the establishment of riparian carr woodland on the organic marsh \nsoils by c. 7800 cal BP. Removal of this woodland by human activity deflected this succession \nback to shallow reedswamp communities, but natural hydrological changes also occurred from this \ntime onwards. The Kuahuqiao diatom data indicate the return of brackish water influence which \npersists at a consistently low level until c. 7500 cal BP when the site was overwhelmed by marine \ntransgression. This fits well with the sea-level curve of Bird et al. (2007), which records a return to \nrapid sea-level rise at about this time, and with the other sea-level histories for the region, which \nrecord sea level rising from this time until reaching its regional maximum between 7000 and 6000 \ncal BP during the peak of the mid-Holocene climatic megathermal (Liu et al., 1992; Zhu et al., \n1996; Chen et al., 2000; Wang et al., 2001). The constant but faint marine influence for three \nhundred years after c. 7800 cal BP suggests either a very slowly rising sea level for that period that \n 21 \ndid not outpace sedimentation, with a sudden acceleration at c.7500 cal BP, or the protection of the \nsite from marine transgression by a barrier system, either natural or artificial. Any artificial barrier, \nor \u2018bunding\u2019 would presumably have been rather rudimentary at this early date, although the \npresence on the site of wooden digging implements and of clay walls reinforcing the dwellings \n(Jiang, 2004) suggests that the capability for barrier construction was present. If any barrier system \nexisted, it failed around 7500 cal BP when the site was overwhelmed by fully marine \nenvironments, as shown by the foraminiferal record (Fig. 5).    \n \n5.3  Human activity \n \n Rice is a wetland grass and requires relatively specific and stable water depths and quality for \nits successful cultivation, so factors affecting site hydrological conditions were clearly of critical \nimportance regarding its cultivation by Neolithic communities, especially in such a low-lying \ncoastal area as the Hangzhou\/Yangtze delta plain, much of which is 2 m above YSD and so \nvulnerable to even small changes in sea level and ground water. Climatic and sea-level fluctuations \nin the first half of the Holocene must have had major implications for the location of Neolithic \nsettlements, their success and even survival in this area (Stanley and Chen, 1996; Chen et al., \n2005, 2008; Yu et al., 2000) as elsewhere in coastal eastern China (Jiao, 2006). With rising water \ntables and frequent flooding (Zhu et al., 2003) local topographic variability must have caused \nmajor differences in settlement potential over small spatial areas (Stanley and Chen, 1996; Zhang \net al., 2004; Xin and Xie, 2006). A key finding at Kuahuqiao is that foragers chose a coastal marsh \nlocation for wet rice cultivation that by natural hydrological succession had reached an optimum \nwater depth, during a period of stable sea level, which they then maintained by very high intensity \nclearance and management of the coastal marsh vegetation by fire. Not necessary for low-scale \npioneer rice cultivation (White, 1995), such significant clearance suggests site selection for higher \nintensity land-use. Moderate microcharcoal increases have been linked with rice cultivation in the \nmid-Holocene elsewhere in the area, as at Guangfulin in the Yangtze delta (Itzstein-Davey et al., \n2007c), where later Neolithic cultivators used burning as an integral part of the planting process, as \nat Chuodun (Cao, 2006). Kuahuqiao, however, is the earliest and most intensive example of \nChinese foragers\u2019 fire-clearance of carr woodland to prepare ground for rice cultivation and \nassociated settlement. The fall of tree and shrub pollen frequencies from 60% to 30% of total land \npollen during the first cultivation phase Kua-6 suggests complete removal of local wetland shrubs, \n 22 \nbut no diminution of forest on drier ground to landward. There is no evidence that fire was used to \nmanipulate the forest beyond the wetland to improve hunting in the way attributed to mid-\nHolocene foragers in Europe (Simmons, 1996) or near-recent foragers in North America (Delcourt \net al., 1998), but separating a microcharcoal component that was derived from higher, dry ground \nfrom the total microcharcoal curve is impractical, unless the low but consistent microcharcoal \nlevels in the pre-cultural sediments of Kua-1 to Kua-5 (Fig. 2) represents a regional signal. \n A further interesting aspect of the rice cultivation system at this very early date is that of \ngrazing (Mesl\u00e9ard et al., 1999) and manuring (perhaps artificially) of the cultivation site by \ndomesticated animals. These would have been pigs, the only animal certainly domesticated in \nChina at this early date, and there is morphological skeletal evidence at the site for the presence of \ndomesticated pigs (Jiang, 2004), although most Sus bones at Kuahuqiao are of wild boar type. \nManuring perhaps occurred consistently, judging by the high values of spores of coprophilous \nfungi (Graf and Chmura, 2006) and Trichuris parasitic worm ova (Pike, 1968), the latter infecting \nboth pigs and people. Trichuris ova have been recorded in quantity at later Neolithic \nsettlement\/cultivation sites, as at Chengtoushan in the middle Yangtze (Yasuda et al., 2004). At \nKuahuqiao pig-keeping at this early date was probably small scale (as the bone assemblage is \nheavily dominated by wild animals, particularly deer) but concentrated in the small area selected \nfor cultivation, hence magnifying its effects, such as the high Trichuris levels. The use of pigs to \nprepare swampy ground for cultivation was a common practice in other subsistence farming \ncultures (Tak\u00e1cs, 1982). The \u2018on site\u2019 environmental evidence from Kuahuqiao not only \nestablishes the presence of extremely early dedicated rice cultivation but is important (Underhill, \n1997) in that it allows for the first time an assessment of the earliest Neolithic rice cultivation \nsystem itself. As the proportion of tidal brackish influence is maintained at a consistent low level \nthroughout the c. 300 years of cultural activity at Kuahuqiao, despite a slowly rising sea level, it is \nlikely that the input of floodwater to the cultivated areas may well also have been controlled by the \ncultivators. The earliest system of rice cultivation in China may well have been a form of \n\u2018receding-flood\u2019 water regulation (Glover and Higham, 1996), with artificial earth barriers to retain \nsome nutrient-rich, silt-bearing seasonal floodwater (Mesl\u00e9ard et al., 1999) and provide rice with \nthe consistent water regime it requires. Water-management systems were probably part of rice \ncultivation practices from the beginning (Ling et al., 2005; Udatsu et al., 1998; Ruddiman et al., \n2008) and the degree of control thus exercised by the Kuahuqiao occupants supports hypotheses \n 23 \nthat low intensity \u2018paddy\u2019 style wet rice production (Barnes, 1990; Pei, 1998, 2002; Zhao and Wu, \n1988; Wang and Ding, 1999; Cao et al., 2006) occurred during the very early Neolithic in the \neastern Chinese lowlands, as early as 7000 cal BP (Wang and Zhang, 1998), although in some \ncases actual \u2018paddy\u2019 plots are presumed rather than demonstrated. The partly organic alluvial \nsediments containing cultural material at Kuahuqiao may well effectively be the earliest \u2018paddy \nsoils\u2019 yet discovered. It is likely that the wild rice strains cultivated there could withstand the low \nsalinity levels suggested by the diatom evidence (Zeng and Shannon, 2000) but rudimentary \n\u2018bunding\u2019 was necessary to protect the crop from major marine inundation, achieved until the \nsystem failed at the start of zone Kua-11 through enhanced sea-level rise or storm surge \npenetration. There are other examples of foragers protecting \u2018speciality\u2019 crops around their \nsettlements through the use of artificial barriers (Hynes and Chase, 1982). \n As stressed by Fuller (2006), Fuller et al. (2007) and Atahan et al. (2008), rice cultivation \nwould have been only one aspect of the exploitation of coastal littoral resources at \nforager\/cultivator sites like Kuahuqiao. In addition to the collection of wild foods, other measures \nmay have been taken to increase the productivity of the wetland environment. The low-intensity \ncontrolled burning of the reedswamp promoted the growth of cattail (Typha) which was perhaps \ndeliberate as Typha is itself an important crop for food and materials (Morton, 1975; Zhao et al., \n1999), exploited and processed by hunter-gatherers since long before the Holocene (Aranguren et \nal., 2007). High levels of burning within lakeside Typha stands recorded at the forager site of Star \nCarr in northern England (Law, 1998) may well reflect similar promotion of a valuable plant \nresource.  \n \n6. Conclusion \n \nKuahuqiao was occupied by sedentary foragers who pioneered rice cultivation in the lower \nYangtze area and who transformed the site\u2019s local vegetation and exercised almost complete \ncontrol over their cultivation environment. Their occupation lasted only about three hundred years \nand it is tempting to attribute that short period to the constraints of major environmental factors. \nSettlement of the Kuahuqiao marshlands required a phase of relative stasis in Holocene sea-level \nrise, and had to wait until natural plant succession and sedimentation reduced the water regime to a \ndepth and quality favourable for wet rice cultivation. It probably also had to wait, however, for the \nwarmer, wetter climate phase that started about 7750 cal BP before substantial rice cultivation \n 24 \nwould be successful at this northerly latitude (Lu et al., 2002). Settlement and cultivation was \nbrought to an end by the renewed rapid sea-level rise that began at about 7400 cal BP and \ninundated the site despite the inhabitants\u2019 efforts at flood control, forcing them to move. The short \nduration of Kuahuqiao highlights the vulnerability of early rice cultivation in this productive but \nenvironmentally vulnerable coastal fringe ecosystem. That Kuahuqiao is one of very few incipient \ncultivator sites yet found of this age shows that it was at or near the start of this innovation in rice \nproduction, but the greater number of Neolithic forager\/cultivator sites of Hemudu-type (Jiang, \n2003) that date to the following millennium, such as Tian Luo Shan (Fuller, 2006) show that \ncultivation techniques were continued and developed by people who spread across the lower \nYangtze\/Hangzhou area, under still favourable mid-Holocene megathermal climate (Sun et al., \n1981), to locations of higher topography beyond the reach of the rising sea level. Extending this \npaper\u2019s multi-proxy palaeoecological research methodology to these sites, and to possible \nforager\/cultivator correlatives of Kuahuqiao such as key sites like Pengtoushan around the lakes of \nthe central Yangtze valley (Pei, 1998), and to the north in Henan Province (Chen and Jiang, 1997), \nwould help to broaden understanding of the development of rice cultivation in China.  \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis research is supported by the Leverhulme Trust, U.K under project number F\/000128\/AL.

Location of Kuahuqiao, in the Hangzhou lowlands of eastern China, to the south of \nShanghai and the Yangtze delta (A), and of earlier Neolithic sites in the area (B). Kuahuqiao lies \nbetween the higher ground of the uplands to the south and west, occupied by late Mesolithic and \nearly Neolithic hunters and foragers at sites such as Shangshan, and sites on the coastal wetlands of \nHangzhou Bay to the east and north, occupied by early Neolithic farmers of the Majiabang culture \nat classic archaeological sites such as Hemudu. The site lies between two ridges in a valley that is \nopen to the tidal rivers to the west (C). Much of the site was removed for brick-making but two \nphases of archaeological excavation have been undertaken since then (D). The location of the \nprofile sampled for palaeoenvironmental analyses in this paper is shown in relation to the most \nrecently excavated area and to major archaeological discoveries at the site (E). \n \n \n\n 47 \n \nFig. 2. Percentage pollen diagram from Kuahuqiao. Pollen and microscopic charcoal fragment \n(microcharcoal) frequencies are calculated as percentages of a total land pollen sum that includes \nall trees, shrubs and terrestrial herbs, but not aquatic herbs or pteridophyte and bryophyte spores. \nCalibrated radiocarbon age ranges before present (cal BP) are shown on the left of the diagram. \nThe seven stratigraphic units in the analysed section are shown on the right of the diagram and \nform the basis for pollen zone boundaries. Depths are in centimetres below present ground surface. \n\n 48 \n \nFig. 3. Percentage non-pollen palynomorph (NPP) diagram from Kuahuqiao.
