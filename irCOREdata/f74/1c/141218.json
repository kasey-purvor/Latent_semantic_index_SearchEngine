This is because \ntheir functionalities are usually dependent on stringent requirements of dimensions, masses or \ntolerances. When mass-producing micro-components, e.g. replication of disposable microfluidic \ndiagnostics devices, the consistency of the produced components could be significantly affected by \nprocess variability. The variability could be associated with a specific process parameter or could \nbe a result of process noise. \nThis paper presents a methodology to assess and minimise process variability in micro-\ninjection moulding, an example of well-established mass-production techniques for micro-\ncomponents.  A design-of-experiments approach was implemented, where five process parameters \nwere investigated for possible effects on the process variability of two components. The variability \nwas represented by the standard deviation of the replicated part mass. It was found that melt \ntemperature was a significant source of variability in part mass for one of the components, whilst \nthe other was affected by unsystematic variability. Optimisations tools such as response surfaces \nand desirability functions were implemented to minimize mass variability by more than 40%. \nKeywords: micro-injection moulding, quality control, design-of-experiments, \nprocess variability, processing parameters. \n \n1. Introduction \nMicro-injection moulding (\u03bcIM), a key technology in high-volume micro-manufacturing \nof polymer-based components, requires accurate control of quality parameters to ensure the \nreplication fidelity and consistency of produced components. \nThe design-of-experiments (DOE) approach has been used in the recent years to evaluate \nand control the effect of processing parameters on the replication quality of \u03bcIM [1]. DOE allows \nthe correlation of process inputs and outputs whilst using less experiments compared to the \n2 \nconventional approach of changing one parameter at a time. It is also used to detect interactions \nbetween input factors.  \nTypical processing parameters (factors) include polymer-melt temperature, mould \ntemperature, holding pressure, cooling time, injection velocity and metering volume. Quality \nparameters (responses) are usually associated with evaluating the replication fidelity of the \nprocesses by completely filling the mould cavity. Typical responses include filling quality of \nmicro-sized channels [2], feature dimension [3-6], part mass [7-11], flow length [12,13], filling \nvolume fraction [14], weld-line formation [15], demoulding forces [16] and minimising injection \ntime, pressure and temperature distribution using a three-dimensional simulation package [17].  \nHowever, a processing aspect that is rarely addressed in the literature is the possible \ninfluence of process parameters on the variability of the response in micro-injection moulding. \nProcess variability is particularly important for microsystem techniques, where tight tolerances are \nusually required for, e.g. dimensions or masses. Variation, in such cases, might affect the stability \nof the process quality outcome. \nVariation occurs normally in industrial processes, which means that measuring a specific \noutput value from the process will reveal differences in measurements between experimental runs \neven if the processing conditions are kept the same [18]. However, an important element of \nunderstanding the effect of processing conditions on the process output is to be able to distinguish \nbetween variations that are attributed to changes in factors and those that result from other causes. \nThe former variations are usually referred to as the signal [19], or systematic variability [20], \nwhich is the change of response that the experimenter is seeking to detect. The latter is usually \nreferred to as the noise, scatter or unsystematic variability of the response that occurs during \nstandard operation conditions. Hence, a fairly high signal-to-noise ration, for example from 4 to 10 \n[18], is favourable, because it indicates that the effect of changing the factors can be distinguished \nfrom experimental noise. \nA concept relevant to experimental signal and noise is the difference between replicates \nand repeats. Replication is the process of conducting experimental trials in a random order, such \nthat factor combination is kept the same, while each experimental trial is done independently \n[18,19,21]. Repetition, on the other hand, is the process of running experimental trials under the \nsame setup of machine parameters. Replicates are useful for improving the chance of detecting \nstatistically significant factors (signals) from within the natural process variation (noise). The more \nreplicates undertaken, the higher are the chances of accurately identifying signals from process \nnoise. \nThis paper investigates controlling process variability in \u03bcIM. It compares the \u201cnatural\u201d \nprocess variation to variations attributed to specific factors. Two micro-moulded Polymethyl \nMethacrylate (PMMA) components were experimentally tested to determine process variability \nand its effect on the produced part mass. Optimisation tools such as response curves and \ndesirability functions are applied to minimize process variation. \n \n3 \n2. Experiment \n2.1. Component geometries \nThe two components, denoted as Part 1 and Part 2, were assembly elements of a \nmicrofluidic device for a medical diagnostics application (A detailed description of the device \nfunctionality and process chain is available in the literature [22]). The components were of the \nsame radial dimension (10 mm) and both contained through-section micro-sized holes. However, \nthe shape complexity and the dimensions of the micro-features varied between components. Part 1 \nconsisted of simple cylindrical features with a relatively large surrounding space for polymer melt \nto freely fill the cavity. Part 2, on the other hand, contained more complex features that would pose \nrelatively \u201cchallenging\u201d flow paths for polymer flow. Figure 1 shows SEM micrographs of the \naluminium mould inserts and corresponding PMMA replicates for both components. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig 1 SEM micrographs of mould-inserts and replicated PMMA parts of the two tested \ncomponents \n2.2. Methodology and equipment \nFive processing parameters were investigated: Polymer-melt temperature (Tp), mould \ntemperature (Tm), holding pressure (Ph), Injection velocity (Vi) and cooling time (tc). The data \ncollected was the component mass (W). \n500 \u03bcm \nPart 1 - mould \n500 \u03bcm \nPart 1 - PMMA \n500 \u03bcm \nPart 2 - mould \n500 \u03bcm \nPart 2 - PMMA \n4 \nA 2-level, half-factorial design of Resolution-V (2\n5-1\n) was selected for this application. In \nthis design the main effects are not confounded with other main effects or with second-order \ninteractions, and the second-order interactions are not confounded with each other. This allowed \nfor a relatively small number of experiments to be undertaken without significantly compromising \nthe accuracy of the results. \nThe micro moulding machine used is a Battenfeld Microsystems 50. The PMMA grade was VS-\nUVT from Altuglas\n\u00ae\n. This particular grade was selected for its ease of flow (MFI = 24 g\/10 min) \nand its optical transparency (light transmittance 92%). A sensitive weighing scale with a \nreadability of 0.01 mg was used to weigh the parts. Data analysis and optimization was conducted \nwith Minitab\n\u00ae\n 15 [23]. \n2.3. Experimentation design and procedure \nTable 1 presents the levels of the five factors for the tested components. \nPart \nMetering \nVolume \n[mm\n3\n] \nTp [\u00b0C] Tm [\u00b0C] Vi [mm\/s] Ph [bar] tc [s] \nLow \nlevel \n(-) \nHigh \nlevel \n(+) \nLow \nlevel \n(-) \nHigh \nlevel \n(+) \nLow \nlevel \n(-) \nHigh \nlevel \n(+) \nLow \nlevel \n(-) \nHigh \nlevel \n(+) \nLow \nlevel \n(-) \nHigh \nlevel \n(+) \n1 179 240 255 70 81 200 300 250 500 4 7 \n2 177 230 250 72 84 200 300 100 300 3 6 \nTable 1. Higher and lower levels for the five factors for Part 1 and Part 2. \n \nProcedures for selecting the levels for each factor are available in the literature [10]. \nTable 2 presents the half-factorial design in its standard order.

A half-factorial, two level 16-run (2\n5-1\n) experimentation design. \n \nFor each run, the moulder was left to operate for 50 cycles to ensure process stability, and \nthen 10 parts are collected to represent the samples of the process \u201crepeats\u201d for that particular run. \nAn average mass (W) was obtained from 10 samples for each run. Each set of designed \nexperiments was repeated 3 times, R1 to R3, where runs are conducted in a random order in each \nreplicate, such that 3 \u201creplicates\u201d are obtained for each experimental run. \nThe purpose of the experiment was to detect potential influential process parameters that \naffect the variability in part mass rather than the mass of the part itself. Therefore, the response of \nthe experiment design was required to be a parameter that reflects variability in mass rather than \nthe mass magnitude. Standard deviation (SD) of the process replicates would be such a measure. \nHowever, as SD does not follow a normal distribution, an assumption in DOE, it could not be used \nas a direct response to the experiments. Hence, the natural logarithm of the SD was used as the \nexperimental response [19,21]. Specifically, the response of the factorial design was set as ln (SD) \nof the 3 replicates. The possible influences of the processing parameters on the response were \ndetected and analysed. \nThe experimental data is presented below in a series of Pareto charts, where the \nmagnitude of each bar was calculated from the half the difference, i.e. |\u0394\/2|, of the responses \nobtained for the average masses measured at the low and high levels of a specific factor (or \ninteraction). Alpha represented a measurement of risk, the value of 0.05 indicating a confidence \nlimit of 95%. The vertical line on each Pareto chart corresponded to the threshold beyond which \nfactors become statistically significant, where the significance threshold was determined by the \nchosen value of alpha. The value of the line was determined from the t-distribution, where t is the \n1-(alpha\/2) quantile of the distribution [23]. \n2.4. Minimising process variability \nAs noted above, if the DOE design revealed no significant effect of any factor on the \nprocess variability, this would indicate that variation in part mass could be attributed to the \n\u201cnatural\u201d noise of the process, and that none of the chosen input factors had played a role in this \nvariation. If, on the other hand, one or more factors were shown to be statistically significant in \nprocess variation, this would indicate that a certain \u201csignal\u201d was detectable from particular \nfactor(s). In this latter case there would be a possibility to minimise or at least decrease this \nvariability using an optimization tool. \nIn this paper, two methods were used to provide guidance on minimising detected \nvariability. Firstly, surface plots were used to visualise and minimize the effect of influential \nfactors. Secondly, a desirability-function tool was also implemented to predict a combination of \n6 \nfactor values that would render a target T, where that target was to minimise the response beyond a \npre-set upper limit U. \nFor the example of one response being optimized, the individual desirability can be \nrepresented by the equation [21]: \n \nUy\nUyT\nTU\nyU\nLy\nyf\nr\ni\n\uf066\n\uf070\n0\n1\n)(                       (1) \n \nThe response, y, varies over a range between 0 and 1, where 1 corresponds to achieving \nthe target and 0 where the function is outside the pre-set limits. In Equation (1), the function \nweight, r, determines the shape of the function, which was set to be linear in this set of \nexperiments, the simplest use of the function. \n3. Results \n3.1.

Discussion \n4.1. Replication \nFigure 4 presents the three Pareto plots corresponding to R1, R2 and R3 as responses. The \nplots show that in each case holding pressure was identified as the most influential parameter on \nthe mass of the part. The magnitude of the bar reveals that its effect is considerably larger than any \nother factor (or interaction between factors).  \nThe order and magnitude of other factors differ from one plot to another, but they are not \nstatistically significant, and their variation can be attributed to process noise. The similarity \nbetween the three plots of Figure 4 indicates that process replicability does not affect the mass, and \nhence the filling quality, of Part 1, which indicates that experimental results are reproducible. The \nhalf-factorial DOE design is also shown to be sufficient for rendering reproducible results. Figure \n5, the Pareto chart of the average mass for Part 1 (W1), shows that, again, holding pressure is the \nonly statistically significant process parameter for part mass.  \nFigure 7 shows the effects of the individual replicates of Part 2. Where average masses in \nreplicates R1 and R3 were the responses, the most influential parameters were, in order, holding \npressure, injection velocity and mould temperature. However, when R2 was used as a response, \nholding pressure followed by injection velocity were influential parameters, whereas other factors \nwere evaluated to be statistically insignificant. This discrepancy suggested that process variability \nwas high enough that it affected the replication of the part.  \nThe Pareto chart of the average mass (W2) is plotted in Figure 8. Similar to the individual \nplots of R1 and R3 of Figure 7, holding pressure, injection velocity and mould temperature are \nhighlighted as the main effects influencing part mass. However, a borderline effect of interaction \nbetween holding pressure and injection velocity is also detected. This \u201cdisturbance\u201d in effects for \nthe average-mass plot arises from the inconsistency in results for the individual replicates. \n4.2. Evaluating parameters that influence variability \nThe individual plots of figure 4 and the average plot of figure 5 showed similar results for \nanalysing individual replicated data and average data. This similarity suggests that the process \nreplicability was not influenced by specific factors. The three plots of Figure 4 were similar in \nshowing that holding pressure is a statistically significant factor. On the other hand, they showed \ndiscrepancies in the position of the threshold line and the significance and order of other factors \nand interactions. These variations may be attributed to the noise of the process that made the three \nreplicates slightly different, without affecting the overall main output of the analysis. Hence, \nFigure 5, which combined the data points of all the three replicates, revealed the same significant \nfactor.  \nIn order to confirm the lack of influence of a specific factor on variability, process \nvariability was investigated as the experimental response, represented by ln (SD). Figure 6 showed \nthe Pareto chart for variability of Part 1. The main effects and interactions lie below the threshold \n14 \n-2.1\n-1.8\n-1.5\n-1.2\n230\n240\n-0.9\n200\n250\n250\n300\nln SD (3)\nInj V\nMelt T\nSurface Plot of ln SD (3) vs Inj V, Melt T\n-2.1\n-1.8\n-1.5\n-1.2\n230\n240\n-0.9\n75\n250\n80\n85\nln SD (3)\nMould T\nMelt T\n-2.1\n-1.8\n-1.5\n-1.2\n230\n240\n-0.9\n100\n250\n200\n300\nln SD (3)\nHold P\nMelt T\nof statistically significant effects. Changes between process replicates could not be attributed to \nany particular factor or interaction. \nIn contrast Figures 7 and 8 indicated process variability was high enough that it affected the \nreplication of Part 2. Figure 9 showed the Pareto chart for variability of Part 2. It shows that melt \ntemperature was the statistically significant source of variation between the three replicates.  \nThe results in Figure 9 show an example of how DOE may be used to detect a specific \nsource of variation in micro-injection moulding. They further show that the factor (or factors) that \nare significant for process variation may not necessarily the same as those that affect the part \nquality parameters. For Part 2, for example, variation in part mass was affected by melt \ntemperature, whereas part mass itself was affected by holding pressure and injection velocity, as \nshown in Figures 7 and 8. \n4.3. Minimizing variability \nDetecting a particular source of variability makes it possible to control it, and hence \nminimise it, by studying the relation between the factor and the response.  \nFigure 10 comprises surface plots illustrating the behaviour of variability versus melt temperature \nand the other factors. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig 10 Surface plot of ln (SD) for three replicates versus melt temperature combined with (a) \ninjection velocity (b) mould temperature (c) holding pressure and (d) cooling time \n \nThe four surface plots in Figure 10 show that decreasing the process variability would be \nachieved by increasing melt temperature.

On average the plots in Figure 10 indicate that setting \nthe melt temperature to its high level (250\u00b0C) would decrease ln (SD) to approximately -1.9, a \nstandard deviation of approximately 0.15. \nA more quantitative approach to control the relation between the standard deviation and \nprocess factors was applied by using a desirability function that, by iterating over Equation 1, \nsuggested a combination of factor values to reach a pre-set target. The pre-set condition of the \ndesirability function was to minimize ln (SD) with a maximum acceptable value of -1.9, as noted \nfrom Figure 10.  \nTable 4 lists the set of processing conditions suggested by the desirability function and \nthe predicted value of the response. \n \nFactors \nMelt T [\u00b0C] 250 \nMould T [\u00b0C] 84 \nHold P [bar] 300 \nInj.

Processing conditions and predicted response values by desirability function. \n \nThe values shown in Table 4 agree, in general, with the trends shown in Figure 10, where \nthe statistically significant factor, melt temperature, is maximized to its upper level, and the other \nfactors, although not statistically significant, are set to minimize the response following the trends \ncalculated from the DOE analysis and presented in the plots of Figure 10. The predicted response \nof -2.05 corresponds to a standard deviation of 0.13.  \nA set of experiments was conducted to attempt to validate the recommendations of the \ndesirability function. The process conditions in Table 4 were applied to produce parts for three \nreplicates. The standard deviation of the three replicates was calculated and compared to the value \nof 0.13 predicted by the desirability function. The experimental value of ln (SD) following the \nsetup recommended by the desirability function was -1.90 (SD of 0.15). \nIt should be noted, however, that the recommended factor values listed in Table 4 are \nlimited by the original setup of the experimental design, which sets the upper limit of the melt \ntemperature to 250\u00b0C. The trends shown in Figure 10 suggest that increasing the melt temperature \nbeyond the upper limit of 250\u00b0C would render lower values of ln (SD) and, hence, less variability. \nHence, the same set of experiments was repeated while increasing the melt temperature from \n255\u00b0C to 270\u00b0C by increments of 5 degrees. \nFigure 11 presents the standard deviation of the replicates at each value of melt temperature \n(where the datum at 250\u00b0C is from the conditions described in Table 4). \n16 \n0.00\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n0.10\n0.12\n0.14\n0.16\n245 250 255 260 265 270 275\nSt\nan\nd\nar\nd\n D\nev\nia\nti\no\nn\n \nMelt Temperature [ C]\nPart 2: SD of 3 replicated experiments vs. melt temperature\n \nFig 11 Standard deviation vs. melt temperature at recommended setup (mould T of 84\u00b0C, injection \nV of 200 mm\/s, holding P of 300 bars and cooling t of 3 sec). Average mass noted for each data \npoint \n \nFigure 11 shows that increasing the melt temperature resulted in a significant decrease in \nstandard deviation of the replicated runs from approximately 0.09 at 255\u00b0C down to approximately \n0.04 at 260\u00b0C \u2013 a decrease in variability by approximately 44%. Above 260\u00b0C, increasing the melt \ntemperature had little effect on the variation of the process. In addition, Figure 11 shows that \naltering the factors to decrease variability induced no significant change in average part mass, and \nhence filling quality. \nIt has been shown above that DOE can be used as an effective tool not just to quantify the \ninfluence of factors on part quality in micro-moulding, but to quantify the influence of factors on \npart reproducibility.  Furthermore, with the addition of response surfaces and the use of a \ndesirability function it has been shown that DOE can be used as a tool to minimise process \nvariability in micro-moulding. \nHowever, DOE cannot give information on causal mechanisms, i.e. why melt temperature \naffects process variability.  In this respect, it can be noted that Parts 1 and 2 showed different \nresponses to process variability, although the same experimental design, machine setup and \nmaterial were used. This suggests a possibility that the complexity of the geometry plays a role in \nprocess variability in micro-injection moulding. The flow behaviour of molten polymer is highly \ninfluenced by the material viscosity, which changes with temperature. The variability observed in \nPart 2 could be associated with the flow resistance posed by the relatively complex cavity \ngeometry. Increasing melt temperature may result in better flow behaviour and, hence, consistency \nin replicated parts. \n \n89.6 mg \n89.7 mg 89.6 mg 89.6 mg \n90.4 mg \n17 \n5. Conclusion \nThis paper aimed at assessing and controlling process variability in a high-volume micro-\nsystem process. It investigated possible effects of processing parameters on process variability in \nmicro-injection moulding. The design of experiments (DOE) approach was shown to be an \neffective tool to quantify the influence of factors on part reproducibility. DOE was used to analyse \nthe effect of five processing parameters on the variability of part mass for two components. In one \ncomponent no factor was identified as a source of variability, whilst for the other component melt \ntemperature was identified as a statistically significant factor affecting the replicability of the \nprocess.  \nIt was shown that a combination of DOE with response surfaces and a desirability \nfunction could be used as a tool to minimise process variability in micro-moulding. Response \nsurfaces were used to illustrate the inverse relationship between standard deviation of part mass \nand melt temperature. Desirability functions were used to calculate a possible combination of \nfactors that minimized standard deviation within the preset limits of the experimental design. The \nreduction in variation achieved experimentally displayed a close match with the prediction of the \nfunction \nIt was shown that increasing the melt temperature beyond the limits of the experimental \ndesign decreased standard deviation by more than 40%. These results suggested that the \ncomplexity of the moulded geometry may be related to the variability of the process. \nReferences \n[1] Attia UM, Marson S, Alcock JR (2009) Micro-injection moulding of polymer microfluidic \ndevices.
