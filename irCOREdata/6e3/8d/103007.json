Within knowledge transfer \nliterature the individual perspective is underdeveloped and this paper seeks to \ncontribute by exploring the function of knowledge within an individual\u2019s professional \nidentity thus unfolding a theoretical connection between the literatures of knowledge \nand identity.  Its central argument concurs with Szulanski\u2019s notion of \u2018internal \nstickiness\u2019 as a barrier to knowledge transfer but extends this hypothesis into the \npsychological ownership of knowledge and to the idea of \u2018possessiveness\u2019. The paper \nargues that the value of self-categorised knowledge places the latter within the \nindividual\u2019s cognitive structure of their identity.  It offers up the idea of valued \nknowledge to the knowledge transfer domain and suggests that feelings of \npossessiveness towards knowledge may intervene in the willingness of an individual \nto disclose knowledge in a knowledge transfer process.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3 \n \nIntroduction \nOur review maps a route through the domains of knowledge and identity with the \npurpose of contributing an explanation of the phenomenon, often referred to as \n\u2018stickiness\u2019, in which the flow of knowledge in an exchange process is inhibited.  It \nfocuses on the individual psychological perspective of knowledge and its innate \nrelationship to identity, that is, how the meaning of knowledge relates to the \ninterpretation of the cognitive sense of self.  Such meanings, when activated, may \noffer a profound explanatory power to behaviours in the process of knowledge \ntransfer.  We pick up on Szulanski\u2019s (1996) notion of \u2018internal stickiness\u2019 because of \nhis concern for barriers to knowledge transfer.  We note that whilst he emphasises \nambiguity and comprehension as communication uncertainties, he attributes little \ninfluence to personal motivation. Following the line taken by Lam (2000), we \nacknowledge different types of knowledge and the fact that they can be held \nindividually and collectively.  We concur with Szulanski that the process of \nknowledge transfer is not automatic and argue that an explanation may lie in issues \nsurrounding knowledge ownership. Our focus is in short on expert professional \nknowledge in the context of knowledge transfer.  \nThe journey is complicated but the pathway is clear.  Literature in areas that \ncohere around the themes of the individual within knowledge transfer processes and \nthe role that knowledge plays in relation to identity is reviewed.  What emerges from \nthis is that identity affects willingness to transfer knowledge because the individual \nhas psychological ownership.  This may induce feelings of possessiveness towards \nknowledge which, we argue is part of their professional identity; the resultant \n 4 \nreluctance is, we argue, a source of stickiness.  In support of this, some arguments are \nfundamental.  \nThe first of these, concerns knowledge ownership.  Here we trace the theme of \nthe locus of knowledge through the literature of individual-group psychology to \nuncover how the pluralism of ownership, i.e., that knowledge which can be owned by \nan individual and by their professional group, is related to the social identity \naffiliation process (Tajfel 1978).  In other words, an individual\u2019s feelings about \nownership of their knowledge are bound-up with affiliation to their professional \ngroup. We infer from this that the individual-group relationship influences the \nsalience of knowledge to identity.  This influence, we suggest, occurs when the \nvaluation of knowledge arbitrates the position of the individual on both polar \ndichotomies.  \nWe see the individual expert as attached to their knowledge through the \nvaluation of that knowledge and similarly attached to their group when that evaluation \nbecomes a favoured attribute of the individual\u2019s group affiliation (professional \nassociation).  There are two cases to be argued.  Firstly, if knowledge is placed in a \npositively valued category within the cognitive structure then it may well be a \nfavoured attribute of group attachment and therefore it is influential to the \ndevelopment of self identity. Secondly, the corpus of knowledge learned through \nprofessional training will be placed in a set of categories that may be similar (not \nidentical) between professionals in the field.  This creates the possibility of a shared \ncognitive structure for individual professionals.  \nThe second fundamental argument concerning knowledge ownership is the \ncomplication that knowledge can be embedded in practice.   The fact that knowledge \ncan be embedded in practice has the effect of emphasising the primacy of the \n 5 \nindividual as the owner of the knowledge and simultaneously highlighting the role of \ncompetence in professional identity.  In this pathway between knowledge and identity \nthe personal need of the professional for integration in the workplace creates a \nsituation whereby the expert needs to demonstrate professional competence to fulfil \nthe expectations of their colleagues and of the image of the professional body.  For \nexample we trust an accountant because we trust the accounting profession. \nThis paper explores the conceptual overlap and theoretical connections \nbetween the literature of identity and that of knowledge.  We see these as centred \nupon the question of the locus of ownership and on the issue of knowledge being \nembedded in action or practice at an individual level.  The view is offered that there is \na reciprocal relationship between knowledge and identity in which both the individual \npsychological perspective and the social identity of the individual matters.  From \nsocial identity theory (Tajfel 1978) we assume that the professional gains their \nrecognised professional identity from their professional group.  Therefore, in \nsummary, we argue that, knowledge has a central place in the cognitive structure of \nan individual\u2019s professional identity.  Thus located, this knowledge, we argue, is \nanchored by a degree of possessiveness which, in turn, affects the individual\u2019s \nwillingness to disclose their knowledge in a knowledge transfer process.  \nIn pursuit of our primary purpose of placing knowledge within the cognitive \nstructure of identity we have identified a commonality within the literatures of \nknowledge and identity.  This consists of the conjoining of the individual aspect of \nknowledge with the self aspect of identity, the ownership aspect of knowledge with \nthe group affiliation and the practical aspect of knowledge with the socialisation \naspect of identity. We use psychological ownership of knowledge to extend the \n 6 \nconnections between the literature of knowledge and identity and to explain the \nwillingness behaviour in knowledge transfer process. \nThis literature review begins with the context of knowledge transfer.  This is \nfollowed by a sub-section, entitled \u2018knowledge\u2019 which is intended as a platform for \nthe principal exploration of how knowledge relates to identity, sub-section \u2018identity \nand knowledge\u2019.  The components of this platform are individualism, possessiveness \nand willingness and it is from this discussion that the main arguments are developed.  \n \nKnowledge Transfer: the Context  \nThis section begins with a brief statement on the importance of knowledge transfer to \neconomic development then we examine the different processes of knowledge transfer \nby reviewing the contribution of the principal models. \n \nThe role of knowledge transfer within development and firm performance  \nThat knowledge transfer is a key factor in organisation performance is well \nestablished in the literature to the extent that it has become an institutionalised \nconcept within economic and technological development (e.g. Drucker 1994; \nDayasindhu 2002; Cohen and Levinthal 1990; Osterloh and Frey 2000).  It is now \naccepted as part of industry and academic relations (Tallman, Jenkins, Henry and \nPinch 2004).  The literature on economic development and strategy is clear in \npositioning technological clusters and knowledge transfer at the heart of the \ndevelopment process (Nonaka 1991; Nonaka and Takeuchi 1995; Tallman et al. \n2004).   \nThe central ideas which link knowledge transfer to development and \nperformance are competitive advantage and strategic alliances. Work on \n 7 \norganisational outcomes emphasises the effect of alliances on increasing the firm\u2019s \nstock of knowledge (Albert, Ashforth and Dutton 2000; Argote and Ingram 2000; \nHelfat 2000; Kogut and Zander 1996).  It is the social processes of networking and \nnexus-forming that bring about opportunities to gain knowledge (Argote, Ingram, \nLevine and Moreland 2000; Ibarra, Kilduff and Tsai 2005).  In this respect, attention \nhas been paid to structural aspects such as proximity and clusters (Mansfield 1991; \nMansfield 1995; Mansfield and Lee 1996; Nonaka and Takeuchi 1995). However, \nnotwithstanding structural concerns there is an assumption in the alliance-forming \nprocess that, putting legal and competitive constraints aside, there is a level of \nopenness to disclosure based on mutual interests (Ashforth 1985; Schneider 1990; \nWest, Smith, Lu and Lawthom 1998).  However, the simple assumption that mutual \ninterests guarantees collaboration is an unsafe one.  \nBoth the nature of the knowledge to be transferred and the level of \norganisational interaction is crucial (Steensma 1996; Mohrman, Gibson and Mohrman \n2002).   Central to this idea is the development of new relationships and structures.  \nCavusgil, Calantone and Zhao, 2003, for example, present a set of hypotheses \nconcerning the relationships between inter-firm relationship strength and knowledge \ntransfer which stresses that close relationships enhance the opportunities for people in \nfirms.  Davenport and Prusak (1998) reported eight critical success factors for \nknowledge transfer including effective knowledge measurement, technical \narchitecture, flexible organisational structure, knowledge-friendly culture, clear \nvision, a performance-based reward system, multi-channel knowledge transfer and \nsenior management support.  These external benefits of knowledge transfer require \nsome control of internal processes that transfer and transform knowledge. We note \n 8 \nthat these critical factors are all external to the individual, a position which we \nchallenge. \n \nThe processes of knowledge transfer:  mechanistic or individual? \nThe principal literature we address in this section is summarised in Table 1 together \nwith their model emphasis and contribution listed.  These models consider the \nprocesses of how knowledge is transferred, either mechanistically or individually \noriented, focusing on the solution to the process.   \nIn reviewing the principal models we acknowledge that they are variations on \nthe theme of socialisation within a group. However we highlight two themes which \nexpress the different objectives and solutions of the model. The first theme places \nemphasis on the \u2018mechanistic\u2019 aspect of the process of knowledge transfer \nhighlighting structural and variable exogenous to the individual. The second theme \ngoes some way towards incorporating human aspects into the process of knowledge \ntransfer.  The review concludes that there is an emphasis on mechanistic solutions to \nknowledge transfer process and little emphasis on the individual\u2019s role within this \nprocess.  The implication of this emphasis is the problematic view that knowledge \ntransfer is seen as an automatic process.

The model of Socialisation, \nExternalisation, Combination, and Internalisation (SECI) (Nonaka and Takeuchi \n1995) is concerned with transforming knowledge through interaction and by practice \nwithin the organisation and emphasises learning and continuous innovation.  Here the \nfocus is on culture, communication and interaction within groups and how this \nencourages knowledge exchange, sharing and consequently development and \nlearning. \n The same structural and interactional approach inhabits best practice models.  \nO\u2019Dell and Grayson (1998) offer a best practice of knowledge transfer model \nincluding a specific set of enabler and steps which are closely related to organisational \nstructure. Lam (2000) and Von Krogh et al. (2000) show a dynamic social \nrelationship between and within groups and suggests the importance of social \nembeddedness.  However, the issue of the form in which knowledge is communicable \nis part of the structural argument.  For knowledge to be shared or exchanged it has to \nbe in a form that is understandable to all parties (Nonaka and Yamanouchi 1989; \nGrant and Baden-Fuller 2000; Malhotra 2003).  Andrews and Delahaye (2000) \nintroduce psychology into the process with their idea of a \u2018psychosocial filter\u2019.  \nHowever, this filter is related to socialisation and the communication process.  \nThe second theme moves towards human factors which determine  \neffectiveness in the knowledge transfer process (Szulanski 1996, 2000; Ashforth \n2001; Akbar 2003).   The work of Szulanski (1996, 2000) examines communication \nand includes variables such as source, channel, message, recipient and context.  The \n 12 \nlatter focuses on the analysis of key barriers to knowledge transfer and identified four \ntypes of stickiness of knowledge. These are to an extent passive and unintended \nbarriers. The emphasis here is on the limits of communication and motivation.  He \ncoins the term \u2018internal stickiness\u2019, meaning to become fearful of losing ownership \nand thus become unwilling to support the transfer, and with connotations of \nreluctance by the recipient to envisage change.  Ashforth (2001) identifies the critical \nmotives in knowledge transfer processes including the elements of identity, sense \nmaking, self control and sense of belonging, concluding such motives stimulate the \nsocialisation process.  The work of Akbar (2003) shows the higher the knowledge \nlevel, the greater is the degree of tacitness between individuals which puts emphasis \non the learning aspects of socialisation.  The implication here is that cooperation \nbetween experts is based on assumptions about the extent of mutual knowledge. \nWhat the above analysis shows is that the current literature sees knowledge \ntransfer as a socialisation phenomenon and seeks explanations through the structural \ndeterminants of communication and motivation.  From this analysis we identify the \nproblem that the individual as a psychological entity has been overlooked in the \nprocess.  Our intention is to extend Szulanski\u2019s idea that reluctance exists within the \nprocess and that requires explanation.  In order to do this we have adopted an intra-\nindividual perspective.  In other words, we bring the individual as a psychological \nentity into the knowledge transfer process and argue that knowledge and identity \nintervene in this process. \n \nKnowledge  \nFrom the review of the knowledge transfer literature we argue that the individual \nperspective has been neglected, therefore it is from this perspective that we now \n 13 \nexamine aspects of knowledge.  The central argument concerns how knowledge is \npsychologically owned by the individual.  In this respect we evoke the notion of \npossession and go on to argue that this property can have an effect on willingness to \ndisclose their knowledge.  To this end this section explores three themes related to \nknowledge.  The first is concerned with the internalisation of knowledge.  The second \ntheme explores the notion of possessiveness, and the third theme deals with the effect \nof internalisation and possessiveness on willingness to disclose. The purpose of \nexploring these themes from the individual perspective is that internalisation and \npossessiveness will later be shown to connect knowledge to identity, whilst \nwillingness to disclose will be shown to be an intervening factor in knowledge \ntransfer. \nIn asserting the primacy of the individual in the knowledge transfer process it \nis necessary to clarify what we mean by the individual perspective. Here we make two \ndistinctions. The first is between our focus on the intra-individual perspective and, \nwhat the \u2018knowledge governance\u2019 movement refers to as the \u2018micro level\u2019 (Foss 2007; \nRothaermal and Hess 2007).  The second is a concern to distinguish related concepts \nof knowledge learned and validated by experience and socially constructed \nknowledge because the distinction may influence the locus of knowledge. As our \nbasic proposition is concerned to place knowledge within a cognitive structure we see \nknowledge as an intrinsic component of the individual. This contrasts with the \nknowledge governance movement which gets close to the individual, in as far as \nseeing individuals as being part of micro-processes which can be governed and \nincentivised, but which remains, in its present state of evolution, as an exogenous \napproach. Knowledge governance is not yet directly concerned with the psychology \nof the individual; it is concerned with motivation not motives. Our approach goes \n 14 \nfurther, to explain the psychology of the individual by uncovering a reluctance within \nthe knowledge transfer process.  \n \nKnowledge and individualism \nThe perspective of the individual as the prime locus of knowledge is contested terrain.  \nCook and Brown (1999), for example, argue that the individual locus of knowledge \nhas been too influential and is dangerous to an integrated approach, an argument that \nis reversed by Van de Ven and Johnson (2006) and supported by Felin and Hesterly \n(2007).  In asserting the primacy of the individual we are not denying the social \nconstructivist argument that knowledge is a social phenomenon that is different from \nthe aggregation of individuals (Nahapiet and Ghoshal 1998, 246).  Nor do we dispute \nthe collectivist view that knowledge can be held within a group (Halbwach 1992).  \nIndeed we will show that this dichotomy is central to arguments concerning the \nmeaning of professional knowledge.   \nOur stance that the individual perspective is important to the understanding of \nknowledge transfer is based on three premises.  The first of these is that knowledge \nembedded in action and beliefs reciprocate each other. The term practice implies both \naction and belief.  This means that learning through doing is applying prior \nknowledge or beliefs.  Following the line of Dewey (1986) that knowledge is context \nspecific, practical knowledge can be seen both as the \u2018understanding\u2019 that emerges \nfrom direct engagement with the environment and from the applied prior knowledge \nbased on theoretical and scientific knowledge (Kondrat 1992). Philosophical \npragmatism sees knowledge as having an instrumental value which places it at the \ncentre of the \u2018truth process\u2019 and simultaneously connects it to action.  In this \nphilosophical approach prior beliefs become \u2018true\u2019 when confronted by events and \n 15 \nreality.  Here confronting information in the external environment means completing \nsome action in a specific context.  It is by doing this that the individual validates their \nexisting beliefs and, as information is transformed into knowledge, simultaneously \ngains explanations that might constitute new knowledge (Morton 2003).  It is this \nreinforcing nature of action and belief which validates knowledge through its own \ninstrumental effectiveness and grants primacy to the atomised individual as the agent \nof knowledge (Tourinho and Neno 2003).   \nIt also draws the external locus of knowledge into the individual\u2019s world \nthrough the process of engaging with the environment.  In other words, knowing is \nhaving experienced the transformation of information into knowledge (Polanyi 1964, \n1975; Machlup and Mansfield 1983; Kolb 1984; Newell et al. 2002; Orlikowski \n2002).  This dual nature of knowledge as something both internal and external is \ncaptured and operationalised by Simon\u2019s concept of bounded rationality where inner \npsychology meets the outer environment (Simon 1999).  The notion of internalised \nknowledge derived from external enactment enables individuals not just to act \neffectively but to imagine possible actions (Maturana and Varela 1987; Von Krogh \nand Roos 1995).  \n We suggest that the notions of practice and effectiveness brings forms of \nknowledge together and enhances awareness and appreciation of the value of existing \nknowledge and we see this as a tentative connection with the idea of professional \ncompetence.  In other words, valuing knowledge is part of a process which binds \nprofessional practice with professional identity.  \nThe second premise concerning knowledge and individualism is the argument \nthat knowledge can be intrinsic to a person.  Bernstein (2000) argues that knowing is \npersonal, but only when it is internalised. Therefore we suggest that knowing places \n 16 \nknowledge not just within the individual self, but also within the realm of that \nindividual\u2019s self-identity.  This raises the question of how and why this should be the \ncase.  Bernstein puts forward an alternative idea which challenges the statement that \nknowledge is personal and owned.  He states that knowledge is money and should \nflow like money to wherever it can create advantage and profit, for knowledge is \nseparated from persons, their commitments and their personal dedications.  These \nbecome impediments and restrictions on the flow of knowledge.  Moving knowledge \nabout should not be more difficult than moving and regulating money.  In other \nwords, he is arguing that any possessiveness associated with the inner value of \nknowledge is an impediment to its greater purpose.  This orientation represents a \nfundamental break in the relation between the knower and what is known.  However, \nit does not separate knowledge from the individual.  For Bernstein, knowledge was an \nouter expression of an inner relationship.  The inner relationship was a guarantee of \nthe legitimacy, integrity, worthiness and value of the knowledge.  Intrinsically valuing \nknowledge can itself produce tensions within the individual in terms of application \nand continuous renewal.  Innate knowledge produces outward behaviour.  This view \noffers a \u2018rope-bridge\u2019 between the cognitive structure, in which knowledge is formed \ninto categories, and the behaviour that follows from that categorisation.  It may offer a \nprofound explanatory power in understanding firstly, what the cognitive knowledge \nheld by professionals in terms of categorising themselves professionally is, and \nsecondly what the behavioural effects placed upon them are. \nThe final premise takes us back to the division of labour and the \ninterdependence of technological processes. In simple terms, the fact of working with \nothers carries the assumption of a degree of commonality of knowledge.  Common \nknowledge, however, is not a prerequisite of cooperation within a group. This is the \n 17 \nterrain of the knowledge management literature which sees the flow of knowledge as \nessential to effectiveness within organisations (Karreman and Alvesson 2004).  \nHowever, the previously quoted evidence that knowledge can be a \u2018sticky\u2019 asset, \nmeaning that it flows between locations with some difficulty is problematic \n(Szulanski 1996; Von Hippel 1994).  The conclusion that there must be impediments \nis unavoidable. To an extent, this problem can be seen either as one of codification, \nthe impediment being the variety of taxonomies generated (Tsoukas 1996 in \nOrlikowski 2002), or, as one of structural support design (Kelloway and Barling \n2000).  However, these may not be the sole sources of the problem.  \nWhile common knowledge may not be a perquisite of cooperation, knowledge \nwhich specifically enables people to function interdependently is. It gives this \nparticular form of knowledge a value both to the individual and the organisation.   The \nvalue placed on this knowledge may well be related to both cooperation and the \nformation of a situated social identity.  In other words, knowledge may remain \nindividual but have the function of engaging with others and it is valued for that \nreason.   \n \nKnowledge and the notion of possessiveness \nIn the arguments which follow it is possible to suggest that the psychological \nownership of knowledge can be strong enough to amount to possession (Pierce, \nKostova and Dirks 2001).  We argue that, if we are correct, possessions and \npossessiveness are part of the process of identity formation. \nFurby (1991) offered the thesis that there is a \u2018psychology of mine\u2019 which \nconceptualises ownership as entailing an association between a person and an object.  \nThis association leads to the valuation of a possession playing a dominant role in the \n 18 \nowner\u2019s identity to the extent that they become part of the extended self (Belk 1988; \nDittmar 1992).  Mann (1991, 211) wrote, \u201cWhat I own feels like a part of me\u201d \nwhereas Sartre (1969, 591-592) noted that \u201cto have is one of the three categories of \nhuman existence\u201d and that \u201cthe totality of my possessions reflects the totality of my \nbeing \u2026I am what I have\u2026 what is mine is myself\u201d.  And yet possessions are secured \nin a special place labelled \u2018mine\u2019 (Kline and France 1899).  Rudmin (1993, 55) wrote: \n\u201c\u2018Mine\u2019 is a small word.  It is deceptive in its power and importance.  It controls our \nbehaviour, but we rarely notice\u201d.  These arguments indicate that possessiveness is an \nintrinsic process that partially determines one\u2019s self identity.  This intrinsic value of \npossessions grants to the individual both a sense of continuity across time and security \ne.g. like a much loved old jacket (Steiner 1978; Pierce, Kostova and Dirks 2003).  The \nmeaning of possessions however, is not just an intrinsic attachment.  They are visible \nand communicable and can be ascribed a meaning by society (Kron 1983; McCracken \n1986; Saunders 1990; Dittmar 1992).  They communicate the individual\u2019s identity to \nothers, thus achieving recognition and social prestige, and are therefore symbols of \nself (Cooper 1976).  \nTwo aspects of possession have an important effect on their relationship to \nidentity.  Firstly, they represent an aspect of self-control and secondly, they are, by \ntheir very nature, favoured.  Furby (1978) argues that individuals feel more control \nover their possessions than other aspects of life.  Possession may be one manifestation \nof \u2018effectance motivation\u2019, in that the possessor has the ability to affect and control \nthe object in whatever way they wish.  Formanek (1991) takes a different line.  He \nargues that the accumulation of possessions produces a positive and uplifting effect. \nThe more you have of something you like, the better you feel.  Possibly as a result of \nthis self-enhancing bias, owned objects appear to be more attractive and rated more \n 19 \nfavourably than objects that are not owned (Nuttin 1987; Beggan 1992).  It is this \naspect of favouritism towards the possession that we argue is salient to identity \nbecause it is reflected in a concept which is central to social identity formation, i.e. \nattachment or sense of belonging.  And it is this relationship that connects knowledge \nto identity. \nNotwithstanding the above arguments on possessions and identity, the most \nimportant issue is whether knowledge can be regarded as a psychological possession. \nOur arguments here are tentative owing to lack of empirical support but we give \nweight to the argument of Bernstein (2000) that knowledge can be internalised.  Our \nassumption is therefore that to be internalised the knowledge has, in some way, to be \nvalued and, that if valued, it can be regarded as a psychological possession which \nforms an inner meaning to one self.  One possible value that can be placed on \nknowledge is that of utility, that it is valued for its usefulness.  The concept of \nusefulness grants to knowledge an instrumental purpose; something has to be \nachieved.  The achievement can be an action, a thought or both but, in either case, the \nknowledge has a value.  It can be a practical goal, or exploration of something \ntheoretical, or even an abstract concept (Scribner 1986).  Usefulness as a value relates \nto a possession\u2019s role in providing necessary functions (Prentice 1987; Dittmar 1992).  \nIt could be argued, for example, that some forms of knowledge are valued for their \nsymbolic status which may have the function of distinguishing \u2018insiders from \noutsiders\u2019.  Similarly, knowledge can be a reminder to an individual of their group \naffiliation (Collins 2004).  The principle we evoke here is that to understand if and \nhow knowledge is possessed we must understand if and how it is valued.  This will \nshow how it is being used and provide a connection between knowledge and identity.  \n 20 \nReturning to the \u2018stickiness\u2019 proposition; we argue that psychologically \npossessed knowledge can be a barrier to knowledge transfer.  Dirks, Cummings and \nPierce (1996) indicated that psychological ownership explains the conditions under \nwhich, individuals both promote and resist change but they did not extend the \nargument as far as establishing a barrier.  We argue that, when professionals, hold \ntheir expert knowledge as a self-categorised possession it becomes part of their \nprofessional identity.  Such \u2018possession\u2019 may evoke possessiveness behaviour which \nwill, in turn, intervene in the level of willingness to disclose and transfer their \nknowledge.  \n \nKnowledge and willingness  \nThe literature on willingness is limited and has a problem with its definition because it \nis often taken for granted.  In its simplest form willingness can be conceived as a \nfreedom from reluctance (Kahn 1990; May, Gilson and Harter 2004).  However, it is \nnot uncommon for the concept simply to be subsumed within the attitude\/behaviour \nprediction relationship as intentionality (see for example Aryee, Chay and Chew \n1996; Gallucci and Perugini 2003; Landau, Shamir and Arthur 1992; Lee 2001; \nMorgan, Miller and Arasaratnam 2003; Stilwell, Liden, Parsons and Deconinck \n1998).  Putting aside the limitations of definitions, we argue that there are two aspects \nto the willingness relationship to knowledge.  Firstly, there is the willingness to be \npart of the knowledge transfer process and secondly, the actual willingness to disclose \nand exchange knowledge.  Willingness to participate does not guarantee the latter.  \nBoth aspects of willingness are influenced by the level of social identification with \ncollective action and by reciprocity. \n 21 \nKelly and Breinlinger (1996) argue that a willingness to participate in \ncollective action might be better understood as an aspect of identification with \nparticular groups.  The willingness of individuals to engage in collective action by a \ngroup is seen as a measure of their identification with that group (Fosh 1993; Kelly \nand Kelly 1994). This approach makes group functioning dependent on trust.  Whilst \nthis is important, the issue of reciprocity is more immediate to the knowledge transfer \nprocess.  Molm (1994) suggests that a structure of reciprocal dependence is a defining \ncharacteristic of all social relations based on exchange.  Fehr, Fischbacher and \nG\u00e4chter (2002) provide compelling evidence which indicates that many people can \nhave a tendency to voluntarily cooperate if treated fairly.  They call this behavioural \npropensity \u2018strong reciprocity\u2019.  Empirically it can lead to an almost universal \ncooperation in circumstances in which pure cooperation is found, i.e. in circumstances \nin which there is only completely self-interested behaviour, which might otherwise \ncause a complete breakdown of co-operation.  This view is supported by Goh (2002), \nwho argues that cooperation and collaboration are the dimensions which are critical to \nknowledge transfer. For example, knowledge transfer requires the willingness of the \nindividual to work with others and disclose knowledge to their mutual benefit.  This \nimplies that knowledge transfer will not occur in an organisation unless employees \nand groups have a natural tendency to share and collaborate with each other.  This \nnatural tendency is termed as \u2018propensity to reciprocity\u2019 it intervenes between identity \nand actual behaviour (Gallucci and Perugini 2003).  In summary, both the \ndependence-on-trust case and the promise of reciprocal action case are part of the \nindividual-group dichotomy.  Whilst this argument locates the influences on \nwillingness in the individual-group context and suggests reciprocity as a process, it is \nnot complete. There is a clear need for empirical research on the determinants of \n 22 \nwillingness to disclose once the individual is willing to participate.  The knowledge \ntransfer literature infers that once people are willingly inside the process that they will \nexchange knowledge; we contest this assumption. \n \nIdentity and Knowledge \nIn this section we show a number of cognitive and the sociological routes that relate \nknowledge to identity.  We build these relationships into a conceptual framework in \norder to illustrate how they intervene in the process of knowledge transfer. In the \nprevious discussion we have put forward three ideas which, we argue, form a basis for \nrelating knowledge to identity.  The ideas are individualism, the notion of knowledge \nbeing possessed and the possibility that possessiveness can intervene in willingness.  \nWe suggest it is the individual internalised role of knowledge and identity which \nintervene the process of knowledge transfer. We argue that knowledge has a place in \nthe individual\u2019s cognitive identity structure and consequently a role in identity \nformation.  From this we go on to show that the maintenance and enhancement of \nknowledge is a social process involving group attachment procured through identity \nformation processes.  These assertions are based on four premises.  \n\u2022 Premise 1: That knowledge is part of the self-categorisation process; the way \nan individual locates themselves within their cognitive social world is \ninfluenced by the self-valuation of their knowledge.  \n\u2022 Premise 2: That knowledge is held and categorised as a social construct \nthrough group affiliation.  \n\u2022 Premise 3: That knowledge is embedded within action; applied knowledge \nmay even be unconscious because it is contained within action. It can however \nbe demonstrated as competence. \n 23 \n\u2022 Premise 4: Bringing together the second and third premise; there is a process \nin which awareness of identity is activated when confronted with knowledge \nembedded in a situation.  \nIn brief, the analysis of these premises needs both a social psychological and a \nsociological perspective.  From a social psychological perspective the theoretical \nfoundation of identity formation and function lies in identity theory (Burke 1980; \nBurke and Reitzes 1981; Burke and Tully 1977; Stryker 1980; Stryker 1987) with its \nconnotations of self-categorisation theory (Turner 1982; Turner 1985; Turner 1987; \nOakes 1987; Oakes, Haslam and Turner 1994; Turner, Oakes, Haslam and McGarty \n1994; see also Onorato and Turner 2001) and social identity theory (Tajfel 1978) with \nits concept of group affiliations.  It is this latter theory which provides the theoretical \ncontext for relating knowledge to the individual \u2013 group relationship.  The \nsociological perspective in contrast gives insight into the formation of identities by its \nemphasis on the continuous dialogue between self identity and present situation.   \n \nSelf-identity and self-concept distinguished \nIdentity is essentially about self-definition, how one defines oneself and hopes to be \ndefined by others (Gecas 1982).  Although it is a representation of the self it needs to \nbe differentiated from the idea of the self-concept which is focussed more on how \npeople seen themselves in terms of personality characteristics.  The self-concept is a \nconfiguration of perception of the individual\u2019s personality and fundamental view of \nthe world; a mental representation of personality (Rogers 1951; Sternberg and Ruzgis \n1994).  The self-concept is developed in childhood and, after the formative years of \nlife, becomes fairly set and is made less malleable by circumstance.  Identity, in \ncontrast, is a self description that allows the individual to place themselves within the \n 24 \nvarious worlds they inhabit.  The implication of this is that identity can change and \nthat an individual can hold a number of identities simultaneously.  However, for an \nidentity to have any meaning (be self-recognised) it has, to an extent, to be stable.  \nMarkus and Kunda (1986) make the important point that self identity is both stable \nand malleable.  The stabilising element of this process is the anchoring effect of the \ncategorisation of knowledge.  \n \n \nSelf-categorisation and knowledge  \nWhen we argue that knowledge is central to identity we are saying that it has a \nconscious presence in the cognitive structures of the self and of self identity in \nparticular.  This leads directly to questions about where knowledge is placed, and by \nwhat process.  We argue that the process by which the individual places and locates \nthemselves is one of self-categorisation \u2013 sorting life into mental categories.  Being an \nindividual is itself a category (Turner 1985; Turner 1987; Turner et al. 1987; Crisp \nand Hewstone 2006).  From this standpoint individuals have levels of abstraction in \ntheir cognitive structures which vary in strength and produce relative judgements \nabout themselves.  The substance of these categories can be internal aspects of the self \nsuch as substantive knowledge (for example, \u2018I\u2019m good at chemistry\u2019) and self \nknowledge (e.g. \u2018I\u2019m a slow learner\u2019) but it can also be the location of the self within \nthe individual\u2019s social environment (e.g. \u2018I\u2019m middle class\u2019).  We argue that the \nindividual\u2019s self-valuation of their substantive knowledge would be a dimension \nwhich they use to place themselves with their cognitive world in terms of their group \naffiliations and feelings of self-efficacy (Lang and Lee 2005).  In other words, the \nprocess uses substantive matter, including own knowledge, to guide the self into a set \n 25 \nof categories (Turner 1982).  Such self-categorisation guides individual behaviour \nincluding the direction of group affiliations.  Haslam (2004), for example, suggests \nthat self-categorisation as personal categorisation would affect commitment to group \nparticipation (e.g. commitment to a knowledge transfer process).  This highlights the \ncrucial form of self-categorisation that links it directly to identity, that is, group \nattachment or affiliation.  \n \nHere is the essential dichotomy of identity; that it can be both personal \n(individualistic categories) and social (group orientated categories).  The resolution of \nthis dichotomy, we argue, is part of the identity formation process and more \nspecifically such resolution will be influenced by the way in which the individual is \nattached to their chosen group.  \n \nIndividual-group affiliation and attribute valuation \nSocial identity theory (Tajfel 1978) argues that people seek part of their self identity \nthrough affiliation to groups which they then favour.  In the context of professional \nidentity the group is deemed to be the professional body.  The key to understanding \nhow the fact of dual ownership of knowledge creates routes towards identity lie in \nattribute favouritism and shared categorisation.  There are four distinct routes, or lines \nof argument, that relate knowledge to individual-group affiliation and here social \npsychology and sociology offer different contributions.  Firstly, in the case of \nprofessional knowledge, the fact that it can be held both by the individual and by the \nprofessional group means that the process of social identity is salient.  Secondly, the \nethnocentric property of social identity theory suggests the terms of group attachment \nmay feature knowledge as a valued and favoured group attribute.  Thirdly, the \n 26 \nargument that knowledge is a social construct normally sits within an organisational \ncontext but we extend such arguments to include professional bodies.  The key \nelement here is that a corpus of knowledge cannot be remembered by the individual as \nsuch but can be remembered collectively.  Fourthly, we accept the contribution of the \nsocialisation process in attaching an individual to a group in an organisational context. \n \nFollowing the line of Tajfel (1969, 1978) that cognitive categories are pre-\nevaluated entities, it follows that the way an individual categorises their knowledge \nresolves into an evaluated set of categories.  In the case of expert knowledge we \nassume that it is highly valued knowledge.  There are two levels of abstraction here.  \nIn one case knowledge itself is a category.  If that category is valued then it may well \nbe a favoured attribute of group attachment and therefore it is influential to the \ndevelopment of self identity.  In this scenario identity is constructed using knowledge \nas a valued attribute of a group to which the individual favours.  In the second case \nthe corpus of knowledge learned through professional training will be placed in a set \nof categories that may be similar (not identical) between professionals in the field.  In \nother words, individuals may categorise their knowledge as a salient attribute of their \ngroup attachment which creates the possibility of the group having common elements \nwithin their cognitive structure of identity as well as a sense of own group favouritism \n(members could equally well favour other attributes such as prestige).  \n \nCollective knowledge and action \nBounded rationality suggests that knowledge cannot exist in its entirety within the \nindividual\u2019s consciousness (Simon 1999). Therefore the question arises as to how \ndoes a professional recall the corpus of knowledge they learned to qualify?  Halbwach \n 27 \n(1992) reinforces the arguments made by workplace socialisation processes \ntransferring and transforming knowledge when he argues that it is only through \naffiliation to groups that an individual can recall knowledge because that knowledge \nis formed and applied in a specific group context.  It is in this sense that memory \nrequires a group dimension.  Organisational cognition argues that tacit knowledge is \ncontained within activity systems (work systems and routines) that represent a \ncollective mind in that the system itself only works because of a shared \ninterdependence of knowledge between group members (Spender 1998).  The \nawareness of such knowledge is, according to Weick and Roberts (1993) dependent \non the concept of paying heed (mindfulness).  But this is disputed by Reber (1993) \nwho points out that much tacit knowledge is unconscious and also is effective.  Here \nReber is following Polanyi (1964) in that some knowledge is unconsciously known \n(e.g. how to ride a bike).  This notion of tacit knowledge depending on activity with \nothers suggests that knowledge, once outside that system, may not be within the reach \nof recall.  It can only be recalled within a group context.  However, irrespective of the \nnotion of interrelated activity, the case for action as a source of knowledge is crucial \nto the relationship between knowledge and identity.  We argue that professional \nactions contain professional knowledge.  Performance of an action embodies \nknowledge within it.  It is this notion that links the wider concept of professional \nconduct directly to identity.  \n \nSocialisation and identity \nSociological theories of identity formation point to the transitional and sometimes \nprovisional nature of identity.  Individuals construct identity from the degree of fit \nbetween the current self-identity and the discourse presented by the present situation \n 28 \n(Schryer and Spoel 2005).  Broadly speaking theories focus on organisational and \nwork task influences on one hand, and on social interaction on the other.  The \nprocesses of transition and change are influenced by organisational socialisation and \nthe requirement of the work task (Downing 2005; Pratt, Rockmann and Kaufman \n2006).  The emphasis on the nature of the task draws the argument back towards the \ncentrality of knowledge within identity and in the direction of the valuation of \nknowledge, particularly the utility value. In support of this is the notion that the role \nof the task is to validate competence.  This in turn re-enforces the current identity.  By \nperforming a task we validate our knowledge (Wallace 1995).  \nThe social interaction arguments centre upon processes that arbitrate the \nindividual self with the need for a social identity and also upon relational identities \n(Breakwell 1992).  Markus and Kunda (1986) suggest that the need to be seen as \nsimilar to others yet unique is an intrinsic dilemma, resolution of which influences the \nself-concept as well as self identity.  The idea that identity can be a function of \nplacement in relation to individuals and to groups is pursued by Sluss and Ashworth \n(2007).  They argue that not only does that add to the multiplicity of possible \nidentities, it also makes the important point that the individual\u2019s \u2018social world view\u2019 \ncan alter depending on relational identity. These are arguments in favour of the \nsituation influencing identity but they do not contradict the notion of a more secure \ncognitive structure for identity. This set of processes can come together in a single \nprocess to make the individual aware of the relationship between their knowledge and \ntheir professional identity.  This single process, we suggest, is the activated identity. \n \nKnowledge and the activated identity \n 29 \nWe argue that identity itself is an active psychological entity.  In this respect, we  \nargue for the importance of the process whereby identities are activated by situations \nand suggest that such situations are interpreted through a set of prior assumptions \nwhich are, in part, engendered by group affiliations.  Therefore the content and \nstructure of identity becomes engaged with the situation (Endsley 1988).  We argue \nthat when this process occurs it is possessed knowledge and its place in identity that \nwill come to the fore. \nA sense of professionalism occurs when specialised knowledge is critical to \ndoing the work (Fine 1996).  Here the content dimensions of identity structure that are \nrelevant to the situation are brought into play.   In this argument elements of the \nsituation make the individual conscious of their own self-identity.  The situation \n\u2018speaks\u2019 directly to the content of the individual\u2019s identity.  Here there must be some \nform of recognition of relevance, salience or difference between the content \ndimensions of self-identity.  We argue that the individual\u2019s categorised knowledge \nstructure can be activated by the specifics of the situation.  For example, for a sports \nfan (where the sports fan\u2019s identity is activated by seeing sport) watching soccer \nwithout knowledge of the rules would force comparisons with other games as a means \nof understanding, but would also, and  simultaneously, be verifying their \nidentification with other games and their identity as a sports fan.  Although \nknowledge and group affiliation are involved in the interpretation of the situation in \nthis simplistic example, the strength of these two processes, comparison and \nverification, would depend on the motivational context (wanting to watch sport).  \nHowever simply being able to use knowledge to interpret a situation need not engage \nthe identity: the verification process is not automatic.  The non-sports fans could be \nengaged through curiosity and try to develop new knowledge but there would be no \n 30 \nverification of identity unless the individual identified with a group who \u2018dislike \nsport\u2019.  The \u2018fit\u2019 process involves knowledge alignment and verification.  It also \ninvolves motivation but exactly what role motivation plays in the \u2018fit\u2019 process remains \nunclear.  What this example illustrates is that there are two complimentary processes \nworking together. In seeking \u2018fit\u2019 the individual is determining which part of their \nknowledge structure will be applicable to the situation and simultaneously verifying \nthat they have that knowledge.  Consequently, these processes feed back into the \nindividual\u2019s sense of professional identity. \nAt one level there is the issue of the individual proactively wanting to impose \non a situation in order to affect it and create a statement about self\/identity (Serpe and \nStryker 1987).  A more common situation would be are where a goal or purpose is \ncontained in the situation requiring a judgement and by this means issues of \nintentions, choice and value are drawn into the activation process.  Here the relevance \nof the individual professional\u2019s knowledge is the activating agent in the situation.  \nEmirbayer and Mische (1998) argue that action is always a complex amalgam of \nsocial and interactive phenomenon.  The need to make a judgement brings in the \nprocesses associated with \u2018fit\u2019 with the situation.  The individual needs to feel a sense \nof security in the rightness of the judgement.  This sense of security comes on the one \nhand from the knowledge basis from which it was made reinforced by their \nprofessional identity and on the other hand from the inner meaning of the knowledge \nthat has been valuated and categorised.  If, as Coleman (1990) argues, actions are \ncaused by anticipated consequences then the only guide the professional has to \nestimating those consequences is their accumulated, valued professional knowledge.  \n \n \n 31 \nA conceptual framework \nThe conceptual framework is built in two stages.  The first stage uses the theoretical \narguments made above to explain how knowledge is related to group affiliation and \nthus to identity.  The second stage shows how the process by which willingness to \ntransfer knowledge is affected by the individual\u2019s professional identity and the place \nof knowledge within it.   \n \nThe first stage incorporates the forgoing arguments that connect knowledge to \nself identity through a set of six processes;  \n1. self-categorisation by means of knowledge \n2. attachment to a group which co-owns the knowledge \n3. attachment to that group through knowledge as a valued group attribute \n4. the dependence on the group context for recall of knowledge \n5. recall of knowledge through professional actions sanctified by the \ngroup \n6. the need to be socialised into the current situation and to adjust identity \nto fit in with the professional work group. \n The first five processes are cognitive and affective, with the latter being \nbehavioural.  Figure 1 illustrates the processes by which knowledge is related to group \naffiliation.   \n \n \n \n \n \n 32 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThere are two routes; the cognitive and affective route (left side of diagram) \nand the socialisation process (right side of diagram).   Both routes express different \nprocesses of group affiliation which conjoin in the concept of identity.  The lower box \nillustrates that the cognitive and the social come together under the banner of \ndemonstrable competence when the group sanctioned knowledge is demonstrated to \ncolleagues, and thus validating the individual\u2019s professional status and legitimacy as a \ngroup member.   \nThe thrust of our arguments have been to explore theoretical connections \nbetween knowledge to identity.  The second stage of the conceptual framework, \nCognitive Individual- group \nAffiliation processes\n1. self categorisation by means\nof knowledge\n2. attachment to a group which \nco-owns the knowledge\n3. attachment to that group\nthrough knowledge as a \nvalued group attribute\n4. the dependence on the group\ncontext for recall of knowledge\n5. recall of knowledge through\nprofessional actions sanctioned\nby the group\nSocialisation processes\n6. the need to socialise into\nthe current situation and to fit in \nwith the professional work group \nDemonstrated competence\n5 is joined to 6 to re-enforce\nProfessional identity\nFigure 1  Processes relating knowledge to identity through group affiliation\nIdentity\n 33 \nillustrated in Figure 2 draws conclusions as to how knowledge and identity relations \naffect knowledge transfer.  Fundamentally our arguments seek to explain the \nexistence of a personal reluctance to exchange knowledge based on individual \npsychological knowledge ownership and its relationship to group affiliation.  This, we \nargue, influences the willingness of the individual to exchange their knowledge. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2  Process from identity to willingness  \n \nIn Figure 2, we use the expression \u2018high salience of knowledge\u2019 to represent \nthe valuation through internalisation of knowledge.  The key element of the \nconceptual framework is that it is the internalisation of knowledge, valued by \nIndividual Professional \nconfronted with request to \ndisclose their professional\nknowledge\nHigh salience of \nknowledge \nfit with situation\nIdentity activated\nIndividualism\nFeelings of \npossessiveness\nWillingness to \ndisclose\/\ntransfer knowledge\nProfessional group affiliation\nInternalised knowledge\nIntervene Intervene\n 34 \nindividuals for whatever reason, which counts.  These diagrams show progress from a \nrequest to disclose through to the possibility that possessiveness based on knowledge \nownership may intervene.  The dotted line expresses the innate dichotomy of \nknowledge ownership between individual and group.  The internalisation is about the \nvaluation of knowledge, irrespective of the locus of ownership.  \n \n \nConclusions  \nOur starting point has been the \u2018stickiness\u2019 of knowledge evident in knowledge \ntransfer processes.  We have argued a case for the proposition that knowledge has a \ncentral place in the cognitive structure of an individual\u2019s professional identity.  Thus \nlocated, this knowledge, we argue, is anchored by a degree of possessiveness which, \nin turn, affects the individual\u2019s willingness to disclose their knowledge in a knowledge \ntransfer process. It is in our view that empirical support is needed for the central \nplank of this assertion, that is the self-evaluation of knowledge and its relationship to \nfeeling of psychological ownership.  \n Notwithstanding these concerns we have made a case for the argument that \nknowledge can be psychologically possessed and have suggested that the valuation of \nknowledge is central to that idea.  We conclude from this that this phenomenon \nintervenes in the process of willingness to disclose knowledge, which in effect implies \nthat it can promote both positive willingness and reluctance.   \nThis intervention means that the individual has to be conscious of their \nknowledge and here we draw attention to the nature of practice as having a role in \nidentity.  In this respect not only does it embody professional knowledge but it also \nhas the ability to activate the identity that makes it salient to the idea of professional \n 35 \nidentity.  If when knowledge is activated it simultaneously makes the individual \nconscious of the locus of, and value of, that knowledge, then action is connected \ndirectly to the nature of identity.  Building on this, we suggest, in the context of \nprofessional knowledge, that the effectiveness of practice, taking action that works, is \nreinforcement at the individual level, not just of ability but of a body of professional \nknowledge. \nOne of the foundation arguments in support of our conceptual framework is \nthe notion of internalisation. The problem here is that the literature does not firmly \nconnect internalisation of knowledge to identity.  The literature is limited as to what \ninternalisation actually means and this aspect needs empirical support if stronger \nconnections are to be made between knowledge and identity.  In fact any research \nagenda on internalisation should be expanded to encompass the role for valuing \nknowledge. Valuing and evaluation prompts the question of whether different levels \nof, or valuation of, knowledge mean different levels of identity and differential \nwillingness to disclose knowledge.  This in turn may provide some explanatory power \nto behaviours in the process of knowledge transfer. \nThe conclusion of the review therefore is that there is a case for the \nintervention of willingness at the individual level in the knowledge transfer process, \nand that this is made possible through the conceptual and theoretical integration of \ntwo discrete literatures: knowledge and identity.  In making this case we have argued \nthat the understanding of knowledge transfer needs to go beyond micro level process \nto include intra-individual perspectives. \n \n \n \n \n 36 \n \n \nReferences \nAkbar, H.
