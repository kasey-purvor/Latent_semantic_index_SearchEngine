One important reason for this is our limited\nview of the underlying factors. Virtually all causal\nmodels of health status and health inequality that\nhave been used as a basis for policies and strategies\ntake a restricted view of causation, focusing\npragmatically on mid-level social determinants,\nwhich can be readily measured and\/or which are\nhypothesised to be readily amenable to interven-\ntion. Actually however, in terms of the upstream\u2013\ndownstream metaphor,2 most major proposals for\naddressing or eliminating inequalities in health are\nlocated too far downstream to do more than\naddress the immediate symptoms or effects of\ninequality, as opposed to tackling and eliminating\nthe root causes.\nIt has long been clear that one missing link is\nthe political dimension.3\u20137 Despite the near-uni-\nversal acknowledgement that key elements of\npolitics\u2014such as government, ideology, power\nand authority\u2014have important impacts on the\ndistribution of a very wide range of health\noutcomes, researchers have seldom drawn expli-\ncitly on the rich discipline of political science (the\nsystematic description and analysis of politics) for\nconcepts or theories which will aid our analysis of\ncurrent and historical public health policies and\npractice.\nThis glossary reflects a (re-)emerging awareness,\nwithin the field of public health, of the political\ndimension of health and health inequalities, and it\nalso attempts to define some of the key concepts\nfrom the political science literature in a way which\nwill be of use in future public health analyses.\nExamples from different domains (healthcare and\npopulation health) are provided to highlight how\npolitical concepts pervade health.\nWords that are underlined are defined in this\nglossary. Furthermore, as will perhaps become\napparent in this glossary, the definition of politics\n(and of political concepts) is in itself a political\nact.8 Our own selection and definition of terms is\ntherefore somewhat inevitably guided by politics,\nreflecting our own realistic epistemological posi-\ntion, and particular perspectives; subsequently,\nthis is \u2018\u2018a\u2019\u2019 not \u2018\u2018the\u2019\u2019 politics of health glossary.\nAUTHORITY AND LEGITIMACY\nAuthority is the right to influence the behaviour of\nothers and to obtain compliance through a\nperceived legitimacy. Governments can thereby\nhave authority regardless of whether they are\nactually obeyed. Conventionally, authority is con-\ntrasted with power. However, in Weber\u2019s concept\nof legitimate power, authority is actually equated\nwith power. Therefore, any government that is\nobeyed exercises authority. In the absence of\nauthority, governments can only ensure obedience\nand order through violence. Authority is often\ninterlinked with the concept of legitimacy. In\nsimple terms, legitimacy means rightfulness; the\nright to be obeyed and to exercise authority.9 Many\ngovernment health-promotion interventions\nattempt to influence behaviour on the basis of\nauthority and legitimacy.\nCAPITALISM\nIn its pure form, capitalism refers to any political\u2013\neconomic system in which a free market operates,\nprivate property exists, profit is generated through\nthe production of goods and most individuals sell\ntheir labour for wages. There is no role for the\nstate. In capitalism, as it actually exists, however,\nthe state is usually a property owner and an\nemployer, and it often acts as a regulator\u2014to\nprovide the optimum economic and political\nconditions under which profit can be maximised\n(often on a nation state basis) or to moderate some\nof the excesses of the system such as poverty and\ninequality. In this way, the extent of state\u2019s\ninvolvement in minimising the adverse effects of\ncapitalism can have a vital impact on health\ninequalities.10\nCITIZENSHIP\nNatural or human rights are those to which people\nare entitled by virtue of being a human being.\nOther rights are usually associated with citizen-\nship. Citizenship is \u2018\u2018a status bestowed on those\nwho are full members of a community. All who\npossess the status are equal with respect to the\nrights and duties with which the status is\nendowed.\u2019\u201911 There are three types of citizenship\nrights: civil (freedom of faith, thought, speech and\ncontract), political (right to vote and to be a\nrepresentative) and social\/welfare (right to\n571\nwww.jech.com\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \neducation, health and income maintenance). Citizenship also\nentails obligations, such as to pay taxes or to respect others\u2019\nrights. Health, or the \u2018\u2018right to a standard of living adequate for\nhealth and well-being\u2019\u2019,12 13 is an important social citizenship\nright. Citizens of non-welfare state developed societies, of most\ndictatorships and of the world\u2019s poorest nations are denied this\nfundamental right. This is most apparent in the more extreme\nexamples\u2014such as the 45 million US citizens lacking health\ninsurance. However, so-called welfare states may also restrict\nthese rights\u2014as in the UK National Health Service, where\naccess to healthcare is rationed through high charges for drug\nprescriptions, dentistry and optometry services.\nCIVIL SOCIETY\nCivil society is used to describe the institutions and organisa-\ntions, which, while separate from formal government and the\nstate, nonetheless exert authority and influence. Civil society\nconsists of organisations and institutions including schools,\nhospitals, churches, political parties, trade unions, mass media,\ncultural and voluntary associations. Generally, the term does\nnot include the institutions and apparatus that make up the\nstate. However, whether civil society is separate from (or a part\nof) the state, is a contested matter.14 The fashionable concept of\nsocial capital is centred on the hypothesis that public\nengagement with the agencies of civil society is beneficial for\nhealth and quality of life.15\nDEMOCRACY\nIn a literal sense, democracy means rule of the people (from the\nGreek terms demos and kratos). Democracy takes two forms,\ndirect and indirect. It is direct democracy that is most closely\nderived from the Greek model as all citizens participate in\ndecision making and policy making. Modern models of direct\ndemocracy include: participatory democracy in which there is\nwidespread use of advisory referendums and public consulta-\ntions, and industrial or economic democracy in which workers\nown companies and\/or are involved in decision making.16 It is,\nhowever, indirect democracy in which representatives are\nelected, which has been the more common model. This is\nespecially the case under Western capitalism where liberal\ndemocracy combines representative democracy with the liberal\ncitizenship rights of private property, economic freedom,\npolitical equality and limited government.17 It has been\nsuggested that economic democracy is beneficial for health.16\nEQUALITY\nEquality is conceptualised in a number of ways: formal\nequality, equality of opportunity and social equality. In formal\nequality, all humans are equal under the law regardless of their\npersonal characteristics (such as religion, race or gender) and\nhave an equal right to do as they wish.17 This approach,\nhowever, is rather limited as it does not acknowledge the\nrestrictions placed on exercising equal individual rights by\nwealth, social norms or abilities. For example, in most countries\nall citizens have the formal right to medical treatment but not\nall can afford to exercise this right. Equality of opportunity\nfocuses on this wider context and advocates removing social\nbarriers, that prevent all citizens from having the same initial\nopportunities to progress their natural abilities\u2014that is, an\nequal social opportunity to become naturally unequal.18 Social\nequality instead focuses on equality of outcomes such as wages\nor living conditions.19 Redistributive equality aims to reduce\nsocial inequalities in outcomes by the redistribution of wealth,\nwhereas absolute social equality requires the abolition of all\nprivate ownership. Research into redistributive equality has\nsuggested that health and violence are worse in more unequal\nsocieties.16 20 21\nFREEDOM\nThere are two major approaches to thinking about freedom:\nnegative (freedom from) and positive (freedom to). Negative\nfreedom is associated with the absence of constraints on the\nindividual (including those imposed by government), formal\nequality and legal rights. Negative freedom is associated with\nliberal market economics, choice and the minimalist state.22 In\ncontrast, positive freedom is not only the right to do something,\nbut also the ability and opportunity to do so.23 This conceptua-\nlisation of freedom is commonly associated with justifications\nfor state intervention\u2014the welfare state enhances freedom by\nliberating individuals from social disadvantage.9 Another\npositive definition of freedom, derived from Marx, is freedom\nas lack of alienation made possible through the communal\nsatisfaction of need in a classless society.24 The freedom to\nchoose perspective in debates about healthcare reform,25 there-\nfore, reflects a negative conceptualisation of freedom.\nGLOBALISATION\nGlobalisation is a process through which national economies\nare becoming more open, and are thus more subject to\nsupranational economic influences and less amenable to\nnational control.26 Globalisation differs from the more long-\nstanding process of internationalisation, whereby certain\nelements of the economy such as trade are international, while\nthe principal economic units remain national. So, for example,\nin an internationalised economy, multinationals still have a\nclear national base within one country and are regulated by the\nlaws of that country; in contrast, in globalisation, production is\ntransnational and corporations become stateless and almost\nimpossible to govern.26 Furthermore, globalisation is not simply\na market-driven economic phenomenon, it is also\u2014and very\nmuch\u2014a political and ideological phenomenon.26 27 The emer-\nging effects of globalisation\u2014increased competition and the\nsubsequent decrease in national discretion over domestic\neconomic policy, the breakdown of national coalitions and\nsupport for the welfare state, and the hegemony of neoliberal\nideology\u2014are important for the future funding of healthcare.\nGOVERNMENT\nTo govern is to rule or exercise control over others. More\nnarrowly, government relates to a set of institutions which\ntogether make (legislative), implement (executive) and inter-\npret (judicial system) policies and laws.9 There are different\ntypes of governments including democratic, authoritarian and\ntotalitarian with correspondingly different health outcomes.28\nHEGEMONY\nHegemony is a very sophisticated political concept, associated\nlargely with Gramsci.29 He used the term to describe a relation\nbetween classes: a hegemonic class (or part of a class) is one\nwhich gains economic dominance and\u2014crucially\u2014the consent\nof other classes and social forces, through creating and\nmaintaining a system of alliances by means of political and\nideological struggle.30 Hegemony represents not only immediate\npolitical and economic control, but also the ability of the ruling\nclass to maintain dominance by projecting its own ideological\nvision of the world so that it is accepted as natural and common\nsense (thus assertions that \u2018\u2018there is no alternative\u2019\u2019 to the\nmarket in terms of reforming healthcare provision).\nIDEOLOGY\nIdeology is a system of inter-related ideas and concepts that\nreflect and promote the political, economic and cultural values\nand interests of a particular societal group.32 Ideologies, like\nsocietal groups, are therefore often conflicting and the\ndominance of one particular ideology within a society to a\n572 Bambra, Fox, Scott-Samuel\nwww.jech.com\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nlarge extent reflects the power of the group it represents.\nIdeology can be used to manipulate the interests of the many in\nfavour of the power and privileges of the few.31 So, for example,\nliberal democratic ideology with its emphasis on the individual,\nthe market and the neutral state, can be seen as a reflection of\nthe power of business interests within capitalist society.29 A\nhegemonic (ie, universally prevailing) ideology is usually one\nthat has successfully incorporated and cemented a number of\ndifferent elements from other competing ideologies and thereby\nfuses the interests of diverse societal groups and classes.32 There\nis emerging evidence that ideology plays a key role in\ndetermining mortality and population health.33 Much more\nresearch is required to clarify causal linkages and develop\nappropriate interventions.\nNEO-LIBERALISM\nThe crisis of the welfare state in the late 1970s led to the re-\nemergence of liberal economics (eg, the Thatcher and Reagan\ngovernments): neo-liberalism (neo meaning new). Neo-liberal-\nism resurrected market economics and emphasised the\nimportance of the free market vis-a`-vis state intervention,\nderegulation of the economy, cuts in public expenditure\n(welfare state retrenchment), privatisation of state-owned\ncompanies, flexible working practices, and an increased\nemphasis on the individual and the family compared to the\nwider society (with a corresponding rise in the emphasis placed\non traditional morality and responsibility).26 34 Neo-liberalism is\nstrongly associated with the US, but with economic globalisa-\ntion it has increasingly become an almost universal hegemonic\nideology, the effects of which can be seen in the policies of\nnumerous developed and developing countries. For example, in\nEngland the Blair government has created a healthcare market\nby providing financial incentives to ensure competition\nbetween public and private providers of NHS clinical services\n(http:\/\/www.KeepOurNHSPublic.com).35\nPATRIARCHY\nPatriarchy describes the institutionalisation of male supremacy\nwithin civil society, the (capitalist) economy and the state.\nPatriarchy has been described as \u2018\u2018a relationship of dominance\nand subordinance \u2026 sturdier than any form of segregation and\nmore rigorous than class stratification, more uniform and,\ncertainly more enduring\u2019\u2019.36 More simply, it is defined as the\nsystematic domination of women by men and domination of\nmen by other men.37 It has been used to analyse the nature of\nmale\u2013female relationships and their effects on adverse social\nand economic outcomes for women, and more recently for\nmen.38 In terms of health, cross-national research has demon-\nstrated a strong association between the extent of patriarchy\nand the male mortality rates in a country.39\nPOLITICS\nThere are at least four widely used definitions of the political7 40:\nN Politics as government: politics is primarily associated with\nthe art of government and the activities of the state.\nN Politics as public life: politics is primarily concerned with the\nconduct and management of community affairs.\nN Politics as conflict resolution: politics is concerned with the\nexpression and resolution of conflicts through compromise,\nconciliation, negotiation and other strategies.\nN Politics as power: politics is the process through which\ndesired outcomes are achieved in the production, distribu-\ntion and use of scarce resources in all the areas of social\nexistence.\nHealthcare is considered to be political only if the first\ndefinition is used, whereas in the last definition all aspects of\nhealth, including health inequalities, form part of the political\nsystem.7\nPOWER\nAt the general level, power is about the ability to achieve a\ndesired outcome\u2014power to do something\u2014but more narrowly,\nit is used to mean power over something or someone and to\nmake decisions.9 Influence is the external ability to have some\neffect on the content of these decisions. Research has linked\nlack of power and control with premature mortality and the\nsocial gradient of health.1\nSOCIAL JUSTICE\nSocial justice \u2018\u2018stands for a morally defensible distribution of\nbenefits or rewards in society \u2026 it is therefore about who\nshould get what\u2019\u2019.9 Three aspects of social justice have been\nidentified: to each according to need, to each according to right\nand to each according to deservedness.41 In social justice\naccording to need, material benefits such as income, housing,\nhealth services and so on, should be allocated on the basis of\nhuman need alone.42 In social justice according to rights,\nassociated with liberal democratic ideology, distribution within\nsociety is based on individual worth: those who work hard have\nthe right to what they have earn (eg, a right to own property).43\nIn the conceptualisation of deservedness, distribution is based\non moral worth and natural justice. Distribution reflects\nindividual endowments and abilities, and attempts to intervene\nare against the laws of nature.44\u201346 Health has been identified as\na basic need, and therefore as an issue of social justice\n(according to needs).47\nSTATE\nLike many of the other concepts in this glossary, the state is an\n\u2018\u2018essentially contested concept\u2019\u2019.48 There is, therefore. no agreed\ndefinition of the state, although perhaps the most widely used\nis the narrow liberal democratic pluralist theory of the state as\nsimply the institutions of central and local government, the\npolice, the army and the civil service. The state is considered to\nbe neutral and independent\u2014above any party political disputes\nor the conflicts of economic interests. Political power is\ntherefore dispersed among a wide variety of social groups that\ncompete with one another for dominance and control over the\nindependent institutions of the state. The state can also be seen\nas the embodiment of the collective will. On the other extreme,\nthough, Marxists (most notably Althusser) broaden the\nparameters of the state to include many aspects of civil society\nincluding schools, the healthcare system, the professions (such\nas medicine) and the media.14 Disputes about the role of the\nstate underpin many discussions about healthcare\u2014that is,\nhow much should be publicly provided (by the state), and even\nhealth status\u2014individual versus collective (state) responsibil-\nity.\nWELFARE STATE\nCountries described as welfare states are usually those in which\na substantial proportion of welfare is regulated, provided or\npaid for through the agency of a formal and institutionalised\npublic welfare system.49 Conventionally, the phrase \u2018\u2018welfare\nstate\u2019\u2019 has been used in a narrow sense, as a shorthand for the\nstate\u2019s role in education, health, housing, poverty relief, social\ninsurance and other social services.50 However, other commen-\ntators prefer to use a broader definition of the welfare state as a\nparticular form of state or a specific type of society\u2014social\ndemocratic.49 In this conceptualisation, the term is now used\nonly to refer to countries (such as Sweden or Norway) in which\nA politics of health glossary 573\nwww.jech.com\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nthere are public commitments to full employment, and a\nuniversal benefit system.51 Social democratic welfare societies\n(such as Norway or Sweden) have higher life expectancy and a\nless stark social gradient of health than other developed\ncountries.21\nAuthors\u2019 affiliations\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nC Bambra, Centre for Public Policy and Health, Wolfson Research Institute,\nDurham University, Stockton-on-Tees, UK\nD Fox, A Scott-Samuel, Division of Public Health, University of Liverpool,\nLiverpool, UK\nCompeting interests: None declared.\nREFERENCES\n1 Marmot M, Wilkinson RG, eds.
