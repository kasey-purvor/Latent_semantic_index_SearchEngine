These goals are relevant for livestock production in Kenya, where development\nagencies encourage resource-poor smallholders to acquire large, exotic, high-yielding dairy cows, despite their poor\nperformance, revealed in recent surveys in the highlands and at the coast. The performance of the cows is not in\nquestion. The debate relates to the diagnosis of the causes, their treatment and the prognosis for the production\nsystem. To improve our understanding of the dynamics of the system, models of nutrition and energy, modified for\nthe tropics, were used to measure the thermal responses over 24 h of six pure or crossbred Friesians at a mean\nlactation of 54 (s.d. 21\u00b76) days, in separate zero-grazing units. Four smallholdings were on the hot, humid coast\nand two in the cooler highlands. The output of the model runs was related to the subsequent lactation, calving\ninterval and profitability of the cows. The model showed that the thermal load caused moderate stress for all cows\nduring the day, which became severe in the sun in the highlands, but the drop in air temperature, from 27 8C to\n13 8C, at night dissipated the gain in body heat. At the coast, where the night temperature remained above 24 8C\nand relative humidity above 0\u00b785, there was no remission of heat stress for cows with a milk yield greater than\n11 l\/day. The lactation curve, in all cows, declined from an initial peak to a low profile of 5 l\/day. Cows in both\nregions with initial yields above 20 l\/day had the steepest decline and longest calving intervals (457 to 662 days).\nThey had the largest lactation yields and lowest direct cost per litre, but their poor breeding record reduced cull\nsales and increased replacement cost, raising the total cost per litre. By contrast, the cow with the lowest daily and\nlactation yield had the highest direct cost, but lowest total cost per litre, because she produced 2 heifer calves at\nan interval of only 317 days. These case studies serve as a reminder that, where heat load depresses appetite or\npoor food cannot support lactation, the energy deficit and stress reduces cow fertility, fitness, and longevity, so that\nshe fails to breed a heifer replacement during her shortened productive life. The model predicted that food intake,\ndepressed by heat stress, would not support a milk yield above 14 l\/day and 3000 l per annum at the coast, and\n22 l\/day and 5000 l per annum in the highlands. Therefore, although appearing profitable in the short term, the\ncurrent policy of promoting cows with higher yields than the climate and production system can support, is\nunsustainable. This outcome has implications for smallholder dairy development policy in Kenya, and probably\nelsewhere in the tropics. Instead, one should reconsider smaller exotic breeds and crossbreds with improved\nindigenous dairy cows whose overall productivity from milk yield, fecundity, longevity, and disease tolerance 50\nyears ago was better than that of the modern Holstein-Friesian in a Kenya smallholding.\nKeywords: dairy cows, development policy, small farms, tropical Africa.\nAnimal Science 2006, 82: 705\u2013716\nQ 2006 British Society of Animal Science\nISSN 1357-7298\nDOI: 10.1079\/ASC200689\n705\nIntroduction\nThe primary Millennium Development Goal of the United\nNations (UN) is to halve the proportion of the world popu-\nlation living in extreme poverty by 2015, particularly in Sub-\nSaharan Africa where it has remained at 50% since 1990\n(UN, 2005). In Kenya, for example, the agricultural wage is\nless than a dollar per day, and poverty on the coast affects\nnearly half of rural households (Nicholson et al., 1999). Milk\nproduction is seen as a way of increasing the standard of\nliving of these poor farmers. Kenya has a culture of milk\nconsumption and a recent history of successful commercial\ndairy farms (Chamberlain, 1993). It is well placed to exploit\nsmallholder dairying, which has become the main livelihood\nof more than 600 000 farms (Omore et al., 1999).\nThe current breed of choice for Kenyan small, zero-grazing\nunits is the Holstein-Friesian. In Britain, these cows, routi-\nnely producing .10 000 l of milk per lactation, are said to\nmaximize profit with few animals, enhance production effi-\nciency and nutrient optimization, and reduce environmental\nconcerns about waste (Taylor et al., 2003). However, the\nhigh fixed costs and associated depreciation of British dairy-\ning, requiring economies of scale in terms of the size of\nboth herd and cow (Webster, 1993), are irrelevant for\nKenya smallholders. For them, the main expense is sup-\nplementary feeding, and the main workload is cutting and\ncarrying forage, and fetching water (Van der Valk, 1992).\nTherefore, technical recommendations favour smaller\nbreeds (Bebe et al., 2003a). The choice of the Friesian is\nexplained in terms of its commercial attributes of highest\nmilk yield in a market where payment is based on volume,\nand highest cull value based on heaviest weight (Kahi et al.,\n2000), plus some non-market attributes (Bebe et al.,\n2003b). However, close scrutiny of five surveys of dairy\nsmallholdings in three districts in the Kenyan highlands\nbetween 1996 and 2000 (e.g. Bebe et al., 2003b; Staal\net al., 2003), does not clarify how the breed\u2019s performance\njustifies its promotion. For example, the mean annual milk\nyield of smallholder cows, which were mainly Friesians, was\nonly 1525 l. Nearly all the profit realized came from culled\nanimals, but animal sales and deaths exceeded births in all\nthe surveys. Confirmation that the herds are not self sus-\ntaining, was strongest in the most intensive dairying area\nwhere the cow replacement rate was 0\u00b75, i.e. one heifer or\ncow was available to replace every two cows leaving the\nherd (Bebe et al., 2003b). At the Kenyan coast, the average\nannual milk yield from Friesians in smallholdings (Waithaka\net al., 2003) was even lower than in the highlands, at 1050 l,\nand the average mortality rate higher, at 56% to 18 months\nof age (Maloo et al., 2001a). The poor performance can be\npartially attributed to poor quality forage cut on the road-\nsides, which also brought in tick-borne diseases (Maloo\net al., 2001b). Heat stress was not mentioned in the sur-\nveys, but is another constraint to which lactating Friesians\nare particularly susceptible (Rodriquez et al., 1985), leading\nto depressed food intake and milk production (Johnson,\n1965). The hot, humid climate on the coastal lowlands is\nconstantly above the comfort zone of lactating, exotic, dairy\ncattle (Ikiror, 2001) and is predicted to become 28C warmer\nand 20% wetter by 2050 (Hulme et al., 2001).\nThis review of recent research suggests that the choice of\nhigh-yielding dairy cows for resource-poor, tropical smallhold-\nings cannot be explained by their performance. Therefore,\ntheir continued promotion must be based on the assumption\nthat the environment and system can and will support their\nhigh genetic merit for milk production. The purpose of this\nstudy is to examine if such an assumption is justified.\nMaterial and methods\nGeneral design and location\nTo test if the high-yielding cow can express her potential,\nsix individuals in separate zero-grazing units were studied in\ndetail for 24 h, using new models of animal energy and\nnutrition, modified for the tropics. The models were vali-\ndated against physiological measurements, and then used\nto demonstrate the presence of stress and to predict the\neffect of reducing heat load and improving nutrition and milk\nyield. The cows were multiparous and at a mean lactation\nstage of 54 (s.d. 21\u00b76) days. They were revisited 12 and 24\nmonths later to record their subsequent lactation, calving\nperformance and profitability.\nFour of the case studies were done in the hot, humid,\ncoastal, District of Kilifi (circa 38400S, 398400E) in the coco-\nnut-cashew-cassava agro-ecological zone (Nicholson et al.,\n1999), at an altitude of about 40 m. Two were done in the\ntemperate highland District of Kikuyu (circa 18100S, 368400E)\nin the horticulture-dairy zone (Bebe, 2003), at an altitude of\n1875 m. The initial fieldwork was done in 2003, between\nJanuary and March, when the temperature-humidity-index is\nat its highest (Ikiror, 2001). The breed of choice was Frie-\nsian, but, at the coast during the hot season, only 3 out of\n.60 Friesian dairy cows were found to be in early lactation,\nand only one was on a smallholding. Therefore, three of the\ncows at the coast had some zebu blood, although they\nlooked like Friesians.\nModels\nIn order to simulate the nutrition and thermal responses of\ndairy cows, a system model, originally developed to investi-\ngate the impacts of climate change on dairy cows in temper-\nate countries (Parsons et al., 2001), was modified to suit\nthe smallholder zero-grazing system in Kenya and the avail-\nable data. The original model had four components: grass\nproduction, nutrition and metabolic heat production, thermal\nresponses of the animal, and thermal response of the\nbuilding. The grass production model was irrelevant for the\ncut-and-carry system. The building model was also\nunnecessary, because the data included measurements of\nthe microclimate in the cowshed. Furthermore, the actual\ndiets consumed by the animals were recorded, so the nutri-\ntional model did not need to predict intake. The resulting\nsystem model had two remaining components, which will be\noutlined below: a simplified nutrition model and the model of\nthe animal\u2019s thermal responses.\nThe nutrition model is based on Agricultural and Food\nResearch Council (AFRC, 1993) and considers energy only,\ntreating each day as a single period. It uses the factorial\napproach, estimating the energy needed for maintenance,\ngrowth, milk production and pregnancy. These are converted\nto metabolizable energy (ME) requirements in the food by the\napplication of efficiency factors. For this study, the require-\nments of pregnancy could be neglected. The milk yield was\nmeasured and the model treats maintenance as dependent\nKing, Parsons, Turnpenny, Nyangaga, Bakari and Wathes\n706\non weight only, so the sum of their ME requirements is the\ntotal ME that must be supplied. The difference between this\nrequirement and the ME content of the diet is then expressed\nthrough weight change, with different efficiencies for depo-\nsition and mobilization of body fat reserves. The original\nmodel used separate ME contents for forage and concentrate\nfoodstuffs and balanced them to meet the energy require-\nments of the cow, within a total voluntary intake, estimated by\nthe model from live weight and milk yield. This mechanism\nwas not required, because the actual intake of both com-\nponents was recorded and converted into inputs to the model.\nSimilarly, the actual milk yield was used as an input, instead\nof being estimated from a lactation curve.\nThe only departure from AFRC (1993) is the use of it to cal-\nculate heat production instead of energy requirements.\nMetabolic heat production is calculated as the total ME con-\nsumed, less the energy deposited in milk and body fat,\nusing the equation:\nQ \u00bc Em \u00fe Eg \u00f012 kg \u00de \u00fe Ep \u00f012 kp \u00de \u00fe El \u00f012 k l \u00de\nwhere E is energy requirement, k is conversion efficiency\nand subscripts m, g, p and l denote maintenance, growth,\npregnancy and lactation respectively. The derivation of the\nenergy requirements from mass, growth rate (which may be\nnegative), stage of pregnancy, milk yield and butterfat con-\ntent are given in AFRC (1993).\nThe energy used for maintenance and the excess energy\nrequired, due to the inefficiency of conversion from dietary\nME or mobilized fat, have to be dissipated. Therefore, meta-\nbolic heat production is used as an input to the thermal bal-\nance model. It is assumed that the rate of heat production\nis constant throughout the day. In this version of the sys-\ntem, the interaction is only between the two sub-models,\nand, because it only considers a single day with the inputs\nfully determined, there is no feedback from the thermal\nmodel to the nutrition model to adjust appetite.\nIn order to predict the level of thermal stress suffered by the\ncattle, a mathematical model of the energy balance of\nhomeotherms (Turnpenny et al., 2000a and b) was adapted\nfor Kenyan conditions. The model was based on the physics\nof heat and moisture transfer and, as far as possible,\navoided empirical representations. This allowed the model\nto be transferable to other climates and breeds. It was\ndesigned to run with a long series of readily available hourly\nweather variables as input data. The model works by trying\nto balance heat production with the sensible and radiant\nheat loss determined by the environment. Physiological\nresponses to increasing environmental temperature are\nmodelled sequentially as vasodilation on the trunk, then\nsweating. Since the model was designed to flag incidences\nof stress, rather than simulate the physiology during stress,\nthe animal\u2019s body temperature was assumed constant.\nStress levels were determined by the rate of sweating,\nwhich was defined as \u2018moderate\u2019 when the rate of sweating\nwas half the physiological maximum, and \u2018severe\u2019 when it\nreached the maximum (Turnpenny, 1997).\nMost of the parameters were those used for UK conditions,\nexcept that coat depth was taken as 1\u00b70 mm and coat\nalbedo as 0\u00b71 (black). The minimum tissue resistance on\nthe trunk might be expected to be lower for cattle in the tro-\npics, because they have less subcutaneous fat. However,\nthis value is not easily measured and heat loss is not par-\nticularly sensitive to this parameter. For example, reducing\nthe value from 30 s\/m to 10 s\/m resulted in a reduction in\nevaporative heat loss of only 8%. Therefore, the UK value\nwas assumed in the absence of more robust data.\nModel data preparation\nCow energy requirements were derived from weigh-band\nweight, daily milk yield, and butterfat, from a morning milk\nsample analysed at the Kenya Agricultural Research Insti-\ntute (KARI), Mtwapa. The weigh band was calibrated for\nFriesians, and appeared to be less reliable at predicting the\nweight of the Boran zebu \u00a3 Friesian crossbreds. It gave\nthe tallest and longest (poll to tail head) of the six cows\n(Chonyi 1) the lowest weight. Chonyi 1 was estimated to be\n100 kg less than the other Boran\/Friesian crossbred (Chonyi\n2), which was the shortest in height and length; yet both\nhad the same condition score (3).\nFood intake was measured on the same day as milk yield,\nbut assumed to be the same as on previous days, which\nmay not have been the case. For example, at Tezo and\nKikuyu 2, the cows were disturbed by the hourly data collec-\ntion, even though they were not handled, and at Mtwapa,\nthe cow was given 5\u00b75 kg more maize meal than she could\neat. At the five other farms, fine feed was only given at the\nmorning and evening milking. Fresh forage took up to 5 h to\ncut and carry in the morning, and was feed in portions so\nthat refusals could be cleaned out and the trough replen-\nished. For each feeding event during the 24 h, the feed\noffered and that refused was identified, weighed separately,\nsamples oven dried, and given an ME value from published\nand local records at KARI (Muinga et al., 1998) (Table 1).\nTable 1 Food intake record over 24 h for cow at Kikuyu 1\nFood event Food item Offered (kg) Refused (kg) DM\u2020 (g\/kg) ME\u2020 MJ\/kg DM\n1 Dairy meal 1\u00b740 0\u00b700 860 7\u00b774\n1 Napier grass, wilted, chopped fine 15\u00b720 3\u00b775 176 8\u00b795\n2 Sweet potato vines, fresh intact 5\u00b725 0\u00b700 106 8\u00b708\n2 Calliandra twigs, fresh intact 5\u00b725 0\u00b700 219 9\u00b700\n2 Napier grass, wilted, chopped fine 1\u00b775 1\u00b775 176 8\u00b795\n3 Food mixture, dry ration 4\u00b700 0\u00b750 862 7\u00b787\n4 Dairy meal 1\u00b700 0\u00b700 860 7\u00b774\n5 Kikuyu grass, yellow in warm bag 11\u00b725 0\u00b700 262 8\u00b716\n5 Assorted weeds 3\u00b775 0\u00b700 189 8\u00b716\n\u2020 DM \u00bc dry matter. ME \u00bc metabolizable energy.\nModelling energy metabolism of Friesians in Kenya smallholdings\n707\nA biometeorological data set was collected 17 times\n(s.d.1\u00b76) during the 24 h, and took about 20 min to complete\non each occasion. A Kestrel 3000 Environmental Meter\n(Richard Paul Russell Ltd, 26 Bankhill Drive, Lymington,\nHampshire SO41 9FF, UK) was used to measure dry bulb\nair temperature (to ^1\u00b708C), relative humidity (to ^0\u00b703),\nand moving, 3-s average, air speed (to ^3%) at cow height\n(1\u00b72 m) inside the shed, and also at 2\u00b70 m height outside to\ncheck for obstruction of air flow. A wind direction indicator\nwas used to improve the \u2018on-axis\u2019 accuracy of the Kestrel\nMeter, and compass bearings taken of the openings of the\nshed in relation to the prevailing NE wind. Global solar radi-\nation was measured in the one cowshed with an open cen-\ntral yard, using a Skye Pyranometer SP1100 (Skye\nInstruments Ltd, Unit 21, Ddole Industrial Estate, Llandrin-\ndod Wells, Powys LD1 6DF, UK) and cloud cover estimated\nin octas to compare ceiling temperatures under sun and\ncloud. The overall radiant temperature in the shed (Tr) is\nderived from the mean of the thermal infra-red radiation\nemitted by walls, ceiling and ground, weighted by relative\narea of each of these parts as \u2018seen\u2019 by the animal:\nT 4r \u00bc Wroof T 4roof \u00feWwallsT 4walls \u00feWgroundT 4ground\nwhere Troof, Twalls and Tground are the measured radiant tem-\nperatures of the respective surfaces. W in each case is the\nangular fraction of the total 3608 angle which each shed\npart contributes to the animal\u2019s \u2018view\u2019, as calculated from\nthe shed dimensions. A solid-angle calculation was not\ndeemed proportionate for this analysis due to the size and\nvariable construction of the different buildings. The average\nof three spot temperatures (to ^1\u00b708C) on each room sur-\nface was taken with a hand held, non-contact, infrared ther-\nmometer \u2018gun\u2019, aimed with a laser beam (Oakton InfraPro 3,\nOakton Instruments, Vernon Hills, Illinois, USA). At least\nthree sides of the shed were open, with a few horizontal\npoles to contain the cow, and here, the wall temperature\nwas equivalent to the air temperature. The fourth side\nusually contained the calf behind a solid partition. The con-\ncrete floor was rectangular with a mean area of 17\u00b71 (s.d.\n5\u00b727) m2. Flat corrugated metal roofs were supported on\nposts at a mean height of 2\u00b73 (s.d. 0\u00b753) m in front, and 2\u00b71\n(s.d. 0\u00b756) m behind. Pitched roofs of palm thatch were sup-\nported at a height of 1\u00b77 m (s.d. 0\u00b707) at the sides, and\nraised to 3\u00b72 (s.d. 0\u00b725) m at the ridge.\nCow coat temperature was also taken every hour to compare\nwith that predicted by the model. The average of single spot\nreadings from the shoulders, abdomen and hindquarters, on\nthe back and both sides, was taken every hour, using the\ninfrared thermometer. The activity, attitude and long axis of\nthe cow in relation to the room was also noted, as well as the\nrespiration rate for signs of hyperthermia. None of these\nmeasurements disturbed the cow, which was only handled\nwhen the rectal temperature was taken after milking.\nModel runs\nA baseline run of the model, simulating a 24-h period, was\nperformed for each cow. The nutritional model output for\nthe day was: ME requirement for maintenance and lacta-\ntion, percentage of ME supplied by the diet, and metabolic\nheat produced. The thermal balance model gave hourly\noutputs of coat temperature and stress level, graded mild,\nmoderate and severe. Additional runs, to predict if there\nwas a ceiling to daily milk yield, were performed with\nreduced environmental heat load, redressed energy imbal-\nance, and raised milk yield with improved nutrition.\nLactation curves and annual milk yield\nLactation curves were fitted, by eye, to three or four records\nof daily milk yield for each cow at the start, first third, and\nend of lactation, using the equation of Wood (1969) or Plai-\nzier et al. (1999), whichever gave the best fit. Wood\u2019s\nequation was designed to fit the curve that characterizes\nintensive milk production in temperate countries:\ny \u00bc at be2ct\nwhere y is kg or l\/day, t is months since calving, a scales\nthe curve up and down without changing the shape, b con-\ntrols the initial rise, and c controls the decay from the peak.\nIt was used to predict the temperate lactation curve shape\n(b \u00bc 0\u00b749, c \u00bc 0\u00b7232), with the level \u2018a\u2019 set in the highlands\nat 26\u00b75, and at the coast at 15\u00b78. The equation was also\nsuitable for lactations that declined gradually, namely Cho-\nnyi 2 (a \u00bc 16\u00b78, b \u00bc 0\u00b7001, c \u00bc 0\u00b711) and Tezo (a \u00bc 15,\nb \u00bc 0\u00b72, c \u00bc 0\u00b733). It did not fit curves with an initial steep\nfall, because later in the lactation it predicted a daily yield\nbelow that obtained. Such curves were better described by\nthe logarithmic equation of Plaizier et al. (1999):\ny \u00bc h 2 s ln\u00f0t\u00de\nwhere t is months since calving, h dictates the height of the\ncurve and s the slope, namely those of Kikuyu 1 (h \u00bc 20\u00b72,\ns \u00bc 5\u00b76), Kikuyu 2 (h \u00bc 16\u00b78, s \u00bc 4\u00b78), Mtwapa (h \u00bc 27,\ns \u00bc 9\u00b75) and Chonyi 1 (h \u00bc 14\u00b75, s \u00bc 3\u00b79). The lactation yield\nwas estimated from the area under the curve, then divided\nby the calving interval and converted to annual milk yield.\nBudget analysis\nThe main components are shown in Table 2. The calcu-\nlations were based on those of the Kenya National Dairy\nDevelopment Project (Van der Valk, 1992), except that\nfamily labour was charged at 80% of the agricultural wage\n(Staal et al., 2003), and the \u2018herd\u2019 was not assumed to be in\nlong term equilibrium. Therefore, calving, mortality, buying\nand selling rates were obtained from each smallholding, and\nchecked against the model of demographic rates (Bebe,\n2003). The balance from direct costs of milk production,\ncow replacement cost and revenues from cattle cull sales,\ndivided by litres of milk that could be sold, gave the cost per\nlitre of milk, which was compared with the price obtained.\nResults\nModel validation\nThe hourly outputs of mean coat temperature from the\nmodel were compared with the mean values of the readings\ntaken on the cow (Figure 1). In the highlands, the model\nprediction was normally within 1 s.d. or 18C, and always\nwithin 2 s.d., of the observed coat surface temperature,\nwhereas, at the coast, it was approximately 2 s.d. or 28C\nKing, Parsons, Turnpenny, Nyangaga, Bakari and Wathes\n708\nbelow. The latter discrepancy may be due to the model\nassumption of a constant core temperature of 388C,\nwhereas cattle raised their core temperature during the day\n(see Thermal load and heat stress). As a check, the model\nwas rerun using, as an input, the observed variation in rec-\ntal temperature at Mtwapa, which was 38\u00b798C after morning\nand 39\u00b758C after evening milking. The prediction of coat sur-\nface temperature was improved by about 18C, bringing most\nof the predicted values to within 1 or 2 s.d. of the observed.\nThermal load and heat stress\nIn all six zero-grazing units, the thermal load was high for lac-\ntating dairy cattle (Table 3). At the coast during the day, the\nambient air temperature rose dramatically, with radiant heat\nload even higher in sheds with corrugated metal roofs, where\nthe ceiling temperature reached 588C, compared with 348C\nunder thatch. Values for the temperature humidity index rose\nas high as 84, which is considered dangerous for high yield-\ning Holsteins (Johnson et al., 1963).. The buildings were\nopen sided but there were too many trees and huts between\nthe cow shed and the sea breeze. Therefore, the onshore\nbreeze failed to provide the expected cooling effect, because\nit was reduced to ,1 m\/s inside the cowsheds, from a maxi-\nmum of 3 m\/s along the littoral at midday. There was slight\nremission of heat load at night, but conditions were humid\nand still, and ambient temperature remained above the\nupper critical temperature (218C) at which milk yield is\ndepressed (Thatcher, 1974). In the highlands, the Index\nreached 73 by mid afternoon; a level which is associated\nFigure 1 Mean coat surface temperature of cow (B) in metal-roofed zero-grazing unit during 24-h study compared with that predicted by the\nmodel (\u2020), (a) on coast at Mtwapa, and (b) in highlands at Kikuyu 1.

The heat load was particularly\nsevere in Kikuyu 2, because the food trough was not shaded\nfrom solar radiation of up to 1100 W\/m2. However, at night,\nthe ambient temperature drop exceeded 108C, to well below\nthe upper critical temperature for lactation.\nModel runs revealed that all six cows suffered from moderate\nor severe stress for at least 10 h\/day (Table 4). At the coast,\nthe observed mean rectal temperature after the dawn milking\nwas 38\u00b72 (s.d. 0\u00b758)8C and rose to 38\u00b78 (s.d. 0\u00b729)8C after\nthe evening milking. For three cows with a yield .11 l\/day,\nmoderate stress was continuous, with the highest yielder\n(Mtwapa, 18 l\/day) being on the verge of hyperthermia\n(39\u00b758C) by the evening milking. In the highlands during the\nday, both cows showed moderate stress, which was severe\nin Kikuyu 2 when she stood feeding in the sun. However,\ntheir rectal temperatures dropped from 38\u00b76 (s.d. 0\u00b714)8C in\nthe evening to 37\u00b74 (s.d. 0\u00b714)8C by dawn, which would allow\ntheir appetites to return (Scott et al., 1983).\nFeed and water intake\nFine feeds constituted between a quarter and three quarters\nof the diet, and one-sixth to half of the cost of keeping the\ncow (Table 2). The amount of supplement depended on the\navailability of cash, forage, food crop by-products, grasses,\nand palatable \u2018weeds\u2019 (Table 5). Grass and weeds were\ngathered mainly off farm at the coast, where the labour of\ncutting and carrying took up to 5 h\/day, and amounted to a\ntenth to a fifth of the total cost per cow. Despite the wide\nrange of foodstuffs, there was limited scope to increase the\nmean energy density of the diet above 8\u00b78 MJ ME per kg\n(compare Tables 4 and 5). There was no piped water on\nthe smallholdings of Kikuyu 1 and Chonyi, so the women\nhad to fetch and carry at least 60 l, per cow and calves, in\n20 l containers on foot from up to 2 km away. Lack of water\nwas not thought to depress milk production, compared with\nthe other case studies.\nDaily and annual milk yield\nThe daily yield of all six cows declined from a peak in the\nfirst fortnight to a low, stable profile, that is characteristic of\nKenya smallholdings (Plaizier et al., 1999). Cows in each\nregion with high initial yields of .20 l\/day (Kikuyu 1, 2, and\nMtwapa) had the steepest declines, longest lactations, lar-\ngest lactation yields, and longest calving intervals (Figure\n2a and b; Table 6).

The coast farms used natural service, with\nTezo and Mtwapa having their own bull. The highland small-\nholdings, used artificial insemination (AI). The Friesian (at\nMtwapa) with the highest annual milk yield, failed to recover\ncondition prior to her next (third) lactation, despite having an\nextended calving interval of 457 days. She gave birth to a\ntiny calf, and died with acute mastitis four days later, despite\nveterinary attention. By contrast, the cow (at Tezo) with the\nlowest milk yield had the least heat stress, and shortest lac-\ntation, because of a calving interval of only 317 days.\nCost-price of milk production per litre (in KSh, where KSh\n76 \u00bc US$ 1)\nExcluding niche markets, the mean annual price of milk\n(KSh 19\u00b76, s.d. 1\u00b757) was only 5% above the direct milk\ncost (KSh 18\u00b77, s.d. 2\u00b775) (Table 6). Seasonally the price\nfell as low as KSh 16\u00b70 (at Tezo). In both regions, the cow\nwith the highest lactation yield had the lowest direct cost,\nbut her poor breeding performance added as much as KSh\n1\u00b75 to the cost of herd trading, as provision for her replace-\nment. The cow with the lowest lactation yield (Tezo) had the\nhighest direct costs, despite low fine feed costs. However,\nthe added value of producing two heifer calves within the\nyear, for sale and replacement, offset the milk cost by KSh\n8\u00b72, to give the lowest total cost of milk and herd trade for\nthe six smallholdings (Table 6). The two niche markets with\nhigh prices required higher butterfat than found in Friesian\nmilk, which was mixed with Jersey milk prior to sale. Two of\nthe three crossbred cows had high butterfat (Table 2), which\ncan be attributed to their zebu blood (Anderson, 1935).\nPredicted daily milk yield without stress and energy deficit\nThe daily milk yield that can be supported by a feed intake\nfrom which the metabolic heat can be dissipated, was taken\nas the sustainable level.

To investigate the effects of adding shade, the model\nwas run with direct and diffuse solar radiation inputs set to\nzero throughout the day. With all other inputs unchanged,\nthe duration of moderate thermal stress was reduced from\n7 h to 5 h, and that of severe stress from 4 h to 0 h. The DM\nintake was then raised to 15 kg\/day, the same proportion of\nbody weight as Kikuyu 1, which brought the ME availability\nto 98%. It returned the duration of moderate stress to 7 h,\ncompared with 10 h in Kikuyu 1, and did not produce any\nsevere stress. Increasing the milk yield to 15\u00b79 l\/day, to\nmatch Kikuyu 1 on a pro rata body weight basis, reduced\nME availability to 82%, without raising the stress levels.\nFinally, increasing the ME density of the diet to 9\u00b70 MJ\/kg,\nwhich would be difficult with the existing feedstuffs (Table\n5), raised ME availability to 99%, still with no increase in\nstress. The conclusion from these model runs is that this\ncow\u2019s productivity is being limited, in the first place by lack\nof shade while feeding during the day, and then lack of for-\nage overnight. If these constraints were reduced, Kikuyu 2\nshould be able to achieve a performance comparable with\nKikuyu 1.\nThe possibility of increasing the production of Kikuyu 1\nwas investigated by progressively raising the daily milk\nyield and increasing the ME density of the diet to\nmaintain ME availability over 97%. To increase the yield\nby 10% to 20 l\/day, at the time of the study in the\nsecond month of lactation, the energy density had to be\nincreased to 9\u00b73 MJ\/kg. The resultant stress levels, of\n12 h of moderate but 0 h severe stress, were considered\nacceptable, because there remained 12 h overnight for\nrecovery. To reach a level of 22 l\/day, the energy density\nhad to rise to 9\u00b75 MJ\/kg, at which point moderate stress\nwas present for 15 h, but without severe stress. Raising\nthe dietary energy density to an improbable 9\u00b78 MJ ME\nper kg, compared with the figures obtained in Tables 4\nand 5, increased the duration of moderate stress to 19 h,\nbut still with 0 h severe stress. There seemed little point\nin taking the predictions further, given the sensitivity of\nthe cow to heat stress and the limited availability of high\nquality, fine feed and supplements.\nAt the coast, little could be done to alleviate heat stress,\nbeyond the provision of shade, preferably as thatch rather\nthan corrugated metal. Increasing air speed from still to\n1\u00b75 m\/s resulted in only a 5% decrease in sweat rate. The\nrelatively short duration of moderate stress at Tezo was\nattributed to low food intake (Table 4), because when DM\nintake was raised to 11\u00b78 kg in the model, the duration of\nmoderate stress increased to 23 h. There was little scope to\nreduce the heat increment of feeding by increasing the qual-\nity of the diet, because of the low energy density of the\nweeds, grasses and fine feed that made up most of the diet\n(Table 5), and the lack of land for cultivating forage as\nopposed to food crops. At Mtwapa, which could afford fine\nfeeds, the high-yielding cow was observed to be on the\nverge of hyperthermia. Therefore, the ceiling to daily milk\nyield had to be below 18 l\/day, and above the lowest value\nfor continuous moderate stress of 11 l\/day, which did not\nextend the calving interval.\nPredicted lactation yield of a sustainable herd\nThe optimal lactation curves, in Figure 2a and b, had a yield\nof 3000 l at the coast, and 5000 l in the highlands. They\nwere based on the following assumptions. The cow should\ncalve once a year to ensure a heifer replacement, because\nof her short productive life and the high mortality rate of the\nherd (Bebe et al., 2003b). The lactation should be termi-\nnated at 300 days, because nutritional management before\ncalving plays a critical ro\u02c6le in the subsequent fertility of the\ncow. The daily milk yield at the start of lactation should not\nexceed the acceptable level predicted by the model,\nbecause nutrient shortage or stress is the primary cause of\ninfertility post partum (Wathes et al., 2003). The bulk of the\nconcentrates had to be fed in the first three months, to\nobtain the initial plateau in the lactation curve, instead of the\ncurrent practice of feeding about 2 kg\/day throughout the\nlactation (Romney et al., 2005).\nA comparison of the actual and optimal lactation curves\nreveals that, at the coast, the steep decline in the high\nTable 6 Low cost of high lactation yield offset by high cost of cow replacement\nLocation\nKenya coast Kenya highlands\nCow breed Boran \u00a3 Friesian Fr \u00a3 SEAZ Friesian Friesian\nFarm Chonyi 1 Chonyi 2 Tezo Mtwapa Kikuyu1 Kikuyu 2\nLactation yield, l 2945 3060 1365 4635 5355 3575\nCalving interval, d 343\u2021 370 317 457\u00a7 662 468\nAnnual milk yield, l 3100\u2021 3020 1570 3700 2950 2790\nDirect cost milk\u2020 17\u00b76 18\u00b72 22\u00b77 16\u00b73 16\u00b74 19\u00b78\nCost milk ^ herd trade\u2020{ 17\u00b79 17\u00b72 14\u00b75 17\u00b73 18\u00b70 19\u00b75\nMilk sale price\u2020 20\u00b72 18\u00b71 18\u00b75 40\u00b70k 21\u00b75 25\u00b70k\n\u2020 KSh\/l, where KSh76 \u00bc US$ 1\u00b700.\n\u2021 Abortion 246 days.\n\u00a7 Died 4 days post partum.\nk\nMixed with Jersey milk.\n{Herd trade \u00bc cull sales \u2013 cow replacement cost.\nKing, Parsons, Turnpenny, Nyangaga, Bakari and Wathes\n712\nyielding curve can be attributed to daily milk yield exceed-\ning the physical heat stress threshold. Whereas, in the\nhighlands, steep declines below the threshold imply that\nthe diet is inadequate, unless the threshold has been set\ntoo high.\nDiscussion\nThe issue\nThe disappointing performance of high-yielding dairy cows\nin Kenya smallholdings is not in question. The debate\nrelates to the diagnosis of the causes, their treatment and\nthe prognosis for the high-input production system. The out-\ncome has implications for smallholder dairy development\npolicy in Kenya, and probably elsewhere in the tropics. The\nmodel with its nutritional and thermal components was used\nto improve our understanding of the dynamics of the sys-\ntem. Six case studies from two agro-ecological zones, with\na variety of grade and crossbred Friesians, were not\nexpected to yield statistical comparisons. Nevertheless,\nthey provided realistic scenarios and their diversity was con-\nsidered an asset rather than a weakness, because they\nincreased the range of inputs to the model.\nConstraints, causes and solutions\nCurrent thinking on smallholder dairy management is\nreflected in a paper by Omore et al. (1998), based on the\nhighlands in Central Kenya, in which they highlight aspects\nof poor performance, attribute causes, and offer solutions.\nFor example, low average milk production of 5 to 8 kg\/day is\nattributed primarily to under nutrition, particularly during\npeak lactation, requiring adjustments to concentrate feed-\ning, more crop by-products and road side fodder cultivation.\nThe results from our case studies are largely in agreement\nwith this evaluation. The average lactation yield of the high-\nland case studies (Kikuyu 1 and 2) is similar (8 kg\/day), as\nis the shape of their lactation curves (Plaizier et al., 1999).\nTo convert the lactation to an optimal Wood\u2019s curve (Figure\n2b) will require sufficient concentrates at the beginning of\nthe lactation, which assumes that there is cash to purchase\nfine feed before milk sales have brought in sufficient rev-\nenue to do so. Therefore, farmers may need access to\ncredit to improve the first third of the lactation.\nThe nutrition model takes the debate a stage further by pre-\ndicting that it is probably unrealistic to attempt to achieve\nyields above 18 l\/day by incremental feeding, given the\nenergy density of the available feed (Tables 4 and 5), so\nthat higher yields will be obtained by depletion of the cow\u2019s\nenergy reserves, generating less heat, but reducing body\ncondition and fertility. The thermal model runs, supported by\nthe biometeorological data, confirm that there was heat\nstress, even in the highlands, where it was severe for a\nFriesian standing in the sun, producing only 13 l\/day. That\nstress could be overcome by the provision of shade, but, at\nmilk yields .16 l\/day one has to accept moderate stress\nduring daylight hours in the highlands. The breed of choice\nshould not have a lactation yield .22 l\/day, which is the\nthermal model maximum. This modest level of daily milk\nyield rules out most of the genetic material being promoted\nby international breeding services.\nLong calving intervals, commonly of 600 days, were attribu-\nted to farmers not trying to breed before 200 days post par-\ntum (Omore et al., 1998). The calving intervals of the two\nhighland case studies were 662 and 468 days, but not from\nlack of trying to get the cows in calf. So farmers may not be\n\u2018voluntarily\u2019 lengthening their calving intervals (Plaizier et al.,\n1999), so much as avoiding unnecessary expense from\nrepeated, unsuccessful visits from the AI service. One can-\nnot be certain, which interpretation is true until one has\neliminated the commonest reason for infertility, which is the\nenergy deficit (Wathes et al., 2003). Until that is corrected,\ncurrent emphasis, on the provision of a better artificial inse-\nmination service or other aspects of infertility (De Rensis\nand Scaramuzzi, 2003; Taylor et al., 2003), will not be cost\neffective. To produce a calf per year, the lactation length\nshould not exceed 300 days, giving a maximum annual\nyield under the optimum theoretical curve of 5000 l. This\nlevel looks optimistic compared with the estimate of 3400 l\n(Plaizier et al., 1999), so at this stage of development, cows\nof even lower genetic merit will be required to ensure good\nreproduction.\nThe case studies have little to add to the observation of\nOmore et al. (1998), that calf growth rate is low and mor-\ntality high, due lack of milk and diarrhoea, requiring better\nhusbandry and animal health. Consequently, age at first cal-\nving is late and there is a shortage of own-produced cow\nreplacements. Health in the cow was not considered a big\nproblem, but the prediction that sub-clinical mastitis and\nlameness will become so when milk yields increase, was\nborne out by the death of the Friesian at Mtwapa with acute\nmastitis. Input services were considered inadequate, except\nin the large co-operatives near Nairobi. However, it is not\nclear, from the cost-price calculations in the case studies,\nhow higher inputs could be financed by a low output sys-\ntem. The milk sale price in the case studies was only 5%\nabove direct costs of KSh 17\u00b79 per l, which is in agreement\nwith KSh 17\u00b72 per l in the extensive survey of Staal et al.\n(2003), so profitability is low. There is general agreement on\nthe need to improve the infrastructure to facilitate market\naccess. However, profitability will remain poor until the low\noutput system of e.g. 3500 l per annum, is balanced by\nlower inputs than at present, namely, a less expensive zero-\ngrazing unit and cow, and cheaper husbandry and health\npackage.\nIn less favourable dairying areas than the highlands, such\nas the coast, current thinking puts more emphasis on dis-\nease, which is also reflected in an increased cost of animal\nhealth care in three of the coastal case studies compared\nwith the highlands (Table 2). Up to now, heat stress has\nbeen ignored, which is surprising given the length of time its\neffect on dairy cattle has been known (e.g. Johnson, 1965).\nIt was at the coast, that the thermal model contributed most\nto our understanding of the low performance from high-\nyielding cows. Moderate heat stress was present throughout\nthe 24 h for cows with yields .11 l\/day, even under shade\n(Table 4), and further attempts to adapt the habitat to the\ncow were unsuccessful or impractical. No amelioration of\nstress was observed in the cows under roofs of palm thatch,\ndespite an afternoon radiant temperature of 31\u00b74 (s.d.\n0\u00b742)8C, compared with 39\u00b74 (s.d. 3\u00b754)8C under corrugated\nModelling energy metabolism of Friesians in Kenya smallholdings\n713\nmetal (Table 3). The onshore breeze failed to reach the\ninside of the sheds, even though they were open-sided. It\nwas not strong enough anyway, because air speed has to\nbe more than 3 m\/s at animal height to have a significant\ncooling effect. At such high values for air temperature and\nhumidity, some stress will always be present in lactating\ncattle, even in very high winds. Cooling with electric fans\nwould be too expensive, and spraying is contraindicated in\nsuch a warm, humid environment, except as a measure to\ncontrol disease (Macfarlane and Stevens, 1972). Besides,\nhalf the smallholdings had no power or water supply. There-\nfore, the emphasis should revert to adapting the cow to the\nhabitat. The heat load is not life threatening, but where it is\nunremitting, it is sufficient to depress food intake and repro-\nduction (e.g. Thatcher, 1974; Du Preez et al., 1990), which\nis why the sustainable level is predicted to be lower than in\nthe highlands at only14 l\/day and 3000 l per annum. Of\ncourse, that level can be exceeded, but at a cost that\ncomes later. For example, the grade Friesian at Mtwapa\ngave 35 l\/day after calving, had a lactation yield of 4635 l,\nbut a calving interval of 457 days. She then produced a\nstunted calf, and died 4 days into her third lactation (Figure\n2a, Table 6).\nPrognosis\nWhereas Omore et al. (1998) state that, \u2018smallholder dairy-\ning is viewed by both farmers and development agencies as\na promising avenue for rural poverty alleviation\u2019, the results\nfrom this study require the caveat: \u2018only if you change the\nbreed of cow and the production system\u2019. This warning is\nnot popular with many farmers, development agencies or\nscientists.\nPopularity and problems of the high-yielding cow\nThe initial performance of the high-yielding Friesians in the\ncase studies, helps to explain their reported popularity with\nthe smallholder. The cows with the highest daily and total\nlactation yields had the lowest direct cost per litre (Figure 2;\nTable 6). At the start of the lactation, the farmer\u2019s wife can\ndeduct milk for home consumption and the cost of family\nlabour, but still make a profit. The long term implications of\nthe cow\u2019s low calving rate and shortened productive life\nshould eventually become apparent to the farmer, probably\nbefore they do to the research and development team, who\nwonder why \u2018less than 1% of households have a grade cow\nat the coast, when each grade cow was reported to\nincrease income by KSh 4000 per month, and despite ten\nyears of Livestock Development and National Dairy Devel-\nopment Projects\u2019 (Nicholson et al., 1999).\nThe high-yielding cow is also popular with development\nagencies, because high daily and total lactation yields are\neasy to \u2018sell\u2019 to the uninformed. \u2018Sell\u2019 is the appropriate\nword where bilateral aid is associated with the purchase of\ngoods (genetic material) from the donors, e.g. to the Kenya\nDairy Development Project\/Smallholder Dairy Project\n(2004). The findings of this study mean that \u2018such aid is of\ndubious quality\u2019 (Economist, 2005), and support the reser-\nvation that, latterly, there has been an over reliance on\nimported genetic material, mainly Holstein-Friesians from\nUSA, UK, Canada and the Netherlands (Bebe, 2003).\nThe notion, that dairying is associated with black and white\ncows, is perpetuated by extension officers and animal\nscientists. Returning graduates and visiting researchers try\nand emulate the livestock production systems of the indus-\ntrial \u201cNorth\u201d in which their science has evolved (Waters-\nBayer and Bayer, 2004). They appear to have rejected one\nof the founding tenets of the International Livestock\nResearch Institute, that the path of development for the live-\nstock industry in many poor tropical countries will inevitably\nbe very different from that which has evolved in the devel-\noped world (Rockefeller Foundation, 1994). Furthermore, by\nfocussing on more milk, animal scientists may be tethering\ntheir enquiry to a version of dairy development, which\nmay become obsolete even in Europe and North America.\nThere, the average herd life of a dairy cow has decreased\nsignificantly since the 1980s. It is now only 33 months for\nHolsteins in Canada, with the most frequent reason for\nculling being poor reproductive performance. \u2018It is clear\nthat net farm income could be significantly increased by\nincreasing the herd life and number of lactations\u2019 (Margeri-\nson, 2003).\nConclusion and recommendations\nA dairy development policy, which promotes exotic dairy\ncattle of higher genetic merit than the tropical climate and\nresource-poor smallholding can support, is creating pro-\nblems that are difficult to solve. In order to ensure a sus-\ntainable herd, the potential daily milk yield of a smallholder\ncow should match the availability of food from which the\nmetabolic heat of production can be dissipated. The ceiling\nto milk production at which the heat stress becomes unac-\nceptable will vary with the microclimate and nutrition, but it\nis unlikely to exceed one-third of the genetic potential of a\nFriesian at the coast and one-half in the highlands. Given\nthis low input\/output system, the productivity of the small-\nholder dairy cow needs to be redefined in terms of making\nthe most efficient use of scarce resources, such as ME\n(James and Carles, 1996), labour, capital and health ser-\nvices (Table 2), as well as providing non-marketed ben-\nefits (Bosman et al., 1997). When these criteria were\napplied to small ruminants, indigenous goats (Ayalew et al.,\n2003) and sheep (Baker et al., 2004) were reinstated\nabove exotic introductions, as being more appropriate for\nsmallholder farmers and pastoralists. A similar case can\nbe made for indigenous cattle and their crossbreds with\nsmall exotic dairy breeds. The annual milk yield of dairy\nBoran, Nandi and Jiddu cows, under improved manage-\nment 50 years ago (Faulkner, 1951; Mason and Maule,\n1960), was similar to that of the modern Friesian in a\nKenya smallholding, and their fecundity and longevity was\nconsiderably better.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank the Smallholder Dairy Project of the International Live-\nstock Research Institute, Nairobi, the District Livestock Production\nOffice, Kilifi and the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute, Mtwapa\nfor their advice and support, and especially the smallholders of Kilifi\nand Kikuyu Districts for their collaboration.
