Introduction \nAccounting for the effects of metal fatigue plays a major role in the design of optimized \naerospace structures [1], as the constraints of reduced cost and increased design life of \nstructures have changed the way new materials are introduced in the design cycle of new \nproducts. Aircraft design has moved from a purely performance-driven design approach \nto an approach which incorporates improved performance, extended operating life and \nreduced environmental impact of the aircraft structure [2]. \nUsing large integral structural sections in the design of aerospace components can \nsignificantly reduce the weight of the final assembly. Such structures use new \nmanufacturing methods, as for instance friction-stir welding, which replaces conventional \njoining methods such as riveting and bolting. However, unlike riveted structures, welded \nstructures typically contain no crack stoppers that can retard or arrest fatigue crack \npropagation.  Another inherent inconvenience with welds is the residual stresses caused \nby the intense local heating. These stresses can significantly influence the fatigue life of \nengineering components [3-6]. Fail-safety and damage-tolerance regulations hence \nimpose large safety factors where residual stresses may be present, and this reduces the \nweight competitiveness of integral structures. Thus, lifing models have to be verified in \norder to be able to fully exploit the advantages of welded integral structures. \n \nThe linear elastic fracture mechanics method is the most frequently employed approach \nto account for the effect of an existing residual stress field on fatigue crack growth \nbehaviour [7]. It is assumed that the principle of superposition is valid and that residual \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n 3 \nstress redistribution is not affected by the presence of the small-scale plasticity associated \nwith fatigue crack growth [8]. However, whilst allowing final crack growth lives to be \npredicted with reasonable accuracy, the form of the crack length versus load cycles curve \nis typically quite different from the test results, with initial crack growth being \nunderestimated and later crack growth being overestimated [9, 10]. \n \nTherefore, detailed knowledge of the evolution of residual stresses with fatigue crack \ngrowth therefore has to be determined to assess and validate such models. Several \nresearchers[11-14] have attempted to measure the residual stress relaxation that occurs \nwith crack growth.  However, in the above papers the \u2018crack\u2019 was extended by machining \na notch in the specimen.  Under these circumstances, elastic redistribution of the stress is \nexpected and observed since the slot produced does not have the plasticity associated \nwith a fatigue crack.  In addition, a machined notch, in contrast to a fatigue crack, cannot \nwithstand a compressive traction and as a consequence, elastically relieves a compressive \nresidual stress.   \n \nSeveral researchers [15-18] have investigated the influence of the microstructural \nchanges caused by welding procedures in various materials. These studies revealed that \nthese changes have a relatively small influence on the fatigue crack growth rate. \n \nIt has been suggested that one of the reasons why lifetime prediction in the presence of a \nstrong residual stress fields is difficult is because of the residual stress redistribution that \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n 4 \noccurs due to the interaction between the plasticity that accompanies the fatigue crack \nand the misfit strains that induced the original residual stress field [10, 19]. \n \nNeutron diffraction has been used for measurement of residual stresses in various types \nof materials and industrial components [20-22]. The method has been extensively applied \nto measure residual stresses in welds [23-27] as the stresses are usually high, the gauge \nvolume typically used is small compared to the weld and the penetration depth of the \nneutron beam into the material is large.  Furthermore, the method is non-destructive at the \npoint of application and is therefore ideal for the monitoring of residual stress fields in \nfatigued samples (although some components require the machining of access channels \n[28] and welds require the determination of a point-to-point stress-free lattice reference \nwhich requires extraction of material from the weld being measured or an identical \ncomponent [29]). \n \nIn previous work by the authors of this paper it has been shown by measurement and \nmodelling that the evolution of the residual stresses in a welded M(T) and C(T) specimen \nloaded at constant \u0394K is governed by elastic redistribution [30, 31]. It was further shown \nthat if the initial residual stresses are known, the effect of the residual stresses on the \nfatigue crack growth rate can be predicted using a fracture mechanics approach [32]. \n \nThe focus of the present work is to investigate if the residual stresses are governed by \nelastic redistribution also for a specimen loaded at constant load amplitude, i.e. with \nincreasing stresses intensity factor and plastic deformation at the crack tip as the crack \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n 5 \nlength increases. Plastic deformation might cause a difference in the weld residual stress \nredistribution and relaxation which may invalidate the assumption of superposition. \nIn this work, the residual stresses were measured with neutron diffraction in-situ during \nfatigue loading at the SALSA diffractometer of the ILL neutron source in Grenoble, \nFrance[33].  The re-distribution and the effect of the residual stresses on the crack tip \nstress intensity factor were predicted with a finite element simulation and Green\u2019s \nfunctions. The fatigue crack growth rate through the weld was then predicted by \naccounting for R-ratio effects induced by the residual stresses, in conjunction with \nempirical fatigue crack growth rate curves.   \n \n2.

The current and voltage used in the MIG welding \nprocess were 268 A and 24.3 V respectively. After welding the plate was skimmed down \nto 7 mm and the middle tension (M(T)) specimens were machined with the dimensions \nand orientations as shown in Fig. 1, according to ASTM E 647-00. An initial \u2018defect\u2019 \nwith total length (2a) of 6.7 mm was machined on the weld line using Electro-Discharge \nMachining (EDM).  \n \n2.1 Neutron diffraction and fatigue testing \n \nNeutron diffraction is an established non-destructive technique for determination of \nstrains within metallic structures[20]. The inter-planar distance can be determined from \nthe position of the diffraction peaks as realized by Bragg[34]: \nd\n2sin\n \n(1) \nwhere d is the inter-planar distance, \u03bb is the wavelength of the scattering neutrons and \u03b8 is \nthe angle between the incident ray and the scattering planes. The direct strain (\u03b5) in the \nmaterial in the measured direction can henceforth be computed if both the inter-planar \ndistance of the stressed component (d\u03c3) and an unstressed reference sample (d0) are \nmeasured, using the following expression: \nd d0\nd0\nsin 0\nsin\n1 \n(2) \nThe neutron diffraction measurements were carried out on the SALSA diffractometer[33] \nat the Institute Laue-Langevin in Grenoble, France.

The wavelength was set to 1.7 \u00c5 (0.17 nm) to \nachieve a nearly cubic gauge volume by having a scattering angle (2\u03b8) close to 90\u00ba. \n \nThe stress-free lattice parameter can vary significantly in both the heat affected zone and \nin the weld material itself [36]. Thus, a stress-free reference comb sample was machined \nusing EDM from sections of the original welded plate. The dimensions of the comb teeth \n(2.4 mm \u00d7 9 mm \u00d7 2.7 mm) were small enough to assure that they were virtually stress-\nfree [37]. The inter-planar distance could hence be determined as a function of the \ndistance from the weld centre.  The gauge volume used for the stress-free sample was 1 \nmm \u00d7 5 mm \u00d7 1 mm, with the longer dimension in the through-thickness direction to \nensure that gauge volume was entirely within the \u2019fingers\u2019 of the comb.  \n \nThe specimen was oriented edge-on to the neutron beam (Fig. 2), which is rotated 90\u02da \nfrom the usual orientation which would be used to perform neutron diffraction \nmeasurements of the longitudinal strain component in a plate specimen.  Although this \nincreases the neutron beam path length through the specimen, it allows the use of a gauge \nvolume that extends through the thickness of the specimen (there is no spurious peak shift \ndue to having the gauge volume partially outside the sample in the vertical direction), so \nreducing measurement times. The sample is relatively thin, tending towards plane stress \nrather than plane strain conditions, and no significant stress gradient is expected through \nthe thickness [26].  Both the incoming and the receiving slits were set to 2 mm \nhorizontally, and through the whole specimen thickness vertically.

This was achieved by fixing a \n100 kN Instron servohydraulic stress rig on the SALSA sample table (Fig. 2). A \nsinusoidal shape was used for the load cycle with a maximum load of about 60 MPa and \nan R-ratio (ratio between the minimum and maximum load) of 0.1. The initial frequency \nwas set to 10 Hz. As the fatigue crack growth was undertaken in situ in the neutron beam \nneither optical nor potential drop monitoring of crack length was feasible, and therefore \nthe crack length was monitored with a fractomat gauge (FAC-20, Tokyo Sokki Kenkyojo \nCo., Ltd.).

The specimen was fatigued to grow the crack and then the \nspecimen was un-loaded and the residual stresses were measured. After measurement in \none direction the sample table was rotated 90\u00ba with the stress rig still fixed on top for \nmeasurement in the other (transverse) strain direction. This was repeated until a final \ncrack length of 26 mm was reached. The applied \u0394K increased during the test from 5.6 \nMPa\u221am at the initial notch to 22 MPa\u221am at the final crack length. The stress ratio R was \n0.1. \n \nThe majority of the strain measurements were taken at zero load, i.e., only residual \nstresses were determined.

It can be seen that there is a significant change in stress-free \nlattice spacing in the transition between the weld and parent material. The variation in \nboth directions was similar, and this indicates that the reference samples were indeed \nstress-free. The difference seen between the two directions is indicative of some \ndirection-dependence of the strain-free values, probably as a result of texture in the plate, \nwhich is generally a consequence of the rolling method used in its production. The \nvariability in the parent material is also indicative of texture effects. However, the \nmaximum difference between the two directions is relatively small, <90 \u03bc . \n \n3.2 Measured evolution of residual strains and stresses with crack extension \n \nThe strain values at each measurement position were computed using the measured 2\u03b8 in \nthe stress free comb and the measured 2\u03b8 in the welded M(T) specimen (equation 2). The \nun-cracked and un-fatigued strain and stress distributions, along the uncracked line A-A\u2019 \nas shown in figure 1, are shown in Figures 4a and 4b respectively. \n \nLefebvre et al. have [38] measured the residual stresses in a specimen of the same \nmaterial with similar dimensions, using near-surface X-ray diffraction, and found that the \npeak residual stresses were about 170 MPa. This is consistent with the values measured \nin this study in the bulk of the sample (Fig. 4b).  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n 11 \nThe residual stresses arise due to non-uniform expansion and contraction caused by the \nlocal heating during welding. The hot weld material yields easily, and on cooling down \nmisfit strains are caused between the yielded and the un-yielded material. This induces \nlarge stresses parallel to the weld line (the longitudinal direction). As in most welds, \ntensile stresses exist in the regions close to the weld line and are balanced by compressive \nstresses further out.  The microstructural changes that occur in the weld and HAZ (heat \naffected zone) of this precipitation-hardened aluminium alloy produce a double residual \nstress peak on each side of the weld [25] as is seen in Fig. 4b. \n \nOnly the longitudinal residual stresses will be discussed in this paper, as they will be \nprimarily responsible for affecting the Mode I fatigue crack growth in this sample \ngeometry. \n \nThe full evolution of the longitudinal stresses, together with the Finite Element \nsimulation results that will be described later are shown in Figures 5 (a) to (e). The \nuncertainty in measurement was calculated for each point but it is not plotted in these \nfigures to allow for clearer visualization of the data.  The stress uncertainties, calculated \nfrom the uncertainty in the fit to each diffraction peak, were around \u00b17 MPa. \n \nIt can be seen that the peak residual stress increases with crack growth until a crack \nlength of about 14 mm from the weld centre. It can also be seen that the compressive \nregion of the residual stress away from the crack tip is initially unaffected by the crack \ngrowth. Once the magnitude of the tensile stresses around the crack tip starts to decrease, \nthe magnitude of the compressive stress also decreases to remain in equilibrium (Fig. 5).  \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n 12 \n \nThe residual stresses are compared with the stresses measured in the specimen when \nloaded to Pmax in Fig. 6 (a) to (e). Here it can be seen that the residual stresses are larger \nin the tensile region than the stresses induced by the applied load until the crack length is \nabout 20 mm. It should be noted that the peak residual stresses increase with crack length \nuntil about 14 mm, whereas the applied \u0394K increases continuously with the crack length. \nThe measured compressive residual stress field in the wake of the crack (behind the crack \ntip position) for the M(T) specimen (Fig. 4a) was independent of applied load and \ntherefore cannot be due to physical crack closure. Tsakalakos et al.[39] and Croft et \nal.[40] have measured the residual strain within a fatigued C(T) specimen subjected to a \nsingle overload cycle using energy-dispersive synchrotron X-ray diffraction. They also \nfound an apparent compressive stress in the wake of the crack (behind the crack tip) even \nafter the specimen was completely fractured; hence again there is no physical closure. \nCompressive macro-stresses can be ruled out as the crack plane must be a traction-free \nsurface. These authors suggested that these apparent stresses may be due to anisotropic \nplastic strains in the crack wake [40] or measurement error owing to the gauge volume \ndiffering in the two measured directions [39]. The assumption of plane stress may also \nhave induced some errors in the computation of the stress, but performing the calculation \nusing a plane strain assumption only affects the magnitude of the calculated stresses (with \nhigher magnitudes in plane strain) and does not affect their sign. \n \n3.3 Fatigue crack rate through the specimen \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n 13 \nThe measured crack growth rate through the specimen, made on laboratory fatigue \nmachines using potential drop crack length measurement carried out at Cranfield \nUniversity, is shown in Fig. 7.

The \nsmallest elements along the crack plane were 0.125 \u00d7 0.125 mm\n2\n.  \n \nTwo approaches were employed to introduce the measured residual stresses in the M(T) \nspecimen FE models. The first is the eigenstrain approach [41]. Eigenstrain (\u03b5*) is the \nnon-uniform inelastic strain which causes elastic residual strains and hence stresses. \nWhere the residual stresses are known throughout the whole component, then \u03b5* can be \ndetermined from the following relation directly: \n* Cijkl\n1\nkl\nRS\n (3) \nwhere C is the elastic constant tensor and \u03c3RS are the measured residual stresses. \n \nThe stress distribution ahead of the notch was measured in the M(T) specimen before it \nwas fatigued (Figure 5a). This stress distribution was assumed to represent the \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n 14 \ndistribution throughout the un-cracked specimen (i.e., assuming that the welded plate was \ncontinuously-processed). In this case, for a continuously-processed body with 2D \nsymmetry, one eigenstrain component in the longitudinal direction will contribute to the \nresidual stresses[42] as the other components satisfy the compatibility equation. The \ntransverse stress will also be small in the un-cracked component. The eigenstrain was \nhence computed as follows: \n11 *(y)\n11\nRS(x)\nE\n \n(4) \nwhere E is the Young\u2019s modulus for the material. The eigenstrain field was introduced \ninto the FEA model using a pseudo-anisotropic thermal strain: the UEXPAN subroutine \navailable in ABAQUS is used to define an orthotropic coefficient of thermal expansion as \na function of position. The coefficient of thermal expansion was set to the value of the \neigenstrain at each point and a unit temperature load was then applied to introduce the \nrequired inelastic strain. \n \nFor comparison, the residual stress field was read in directly into the model using the \nSIGINI FORTRAN subroutine implemented in ABAQUS. This is the second approach \ntaken for modelling the residual stress distribution. In the first step of this analysis, the \nstresses were allowed to equilibrate, simulating the residual stresses in the M(T) \nspecimen.  \n \nThe resulting initial residual stresses using both the SIGINI subroutine and the \neigenstrain approaches are shown in Fig. 8.

Modelling of the fatigue crack growth behaviour  \n \nThe evolution of the residual stress intensity factor with crack growth has to be computed \nin order to be able to predict the effect of the residual stresses on the fatigue crack growth \nrate. Two methods were used: Green\u2019s functions, and a finite element approach.

The initial residual stresses were read into the \nmodel as explained in Section 4, and the crack growth was simulated by removing the \nsymmetry boundary conditions. The stress intensity factor was determined through the \ncontour interaction method implemented in ABAQUS. The contour interaction method is \nsimilar to the J-Integral method[45], but the stress intensities in each mode can be \nsubtracted which is not the case with the J-Integral method.  \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n 17 \n \nThe finite element results are compared with the results from the Green\u2019s function \nsolution in Fig. 10.

The crack closure \napproach has been shown not to yield good predictions of the effect of tensile residual \nstresses at low to intermediate applied constant stress intensity factors, as the contribution \nof any crack closure is very small in this case and hence very difficult to measure[46].  \n \nIt has further been shown that, for positive R (Kmin\/Kmax) in the case of positive residual \nstress intensity factors, the crack is opened further by the residual stresses and \nsuperposition is valid as no crack surface interactions occur as would be the case for a \ncompressive residual stress field[32].  \n \nIn this study, there is a high tensile residual stress field present and hence the \nsuperposition approach was used.  \n \nThe superposition approach for prediction of the effects of the residual stress involves \ncomputation of the residual stress intensity factor (Kres) and then superposition of this to \nthe stress intensity factor from the external loading (Kload), as follows: \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n 18 \nKmax Kload\/max Kres \n \nKmin Kload\/min Kres \n(7) \n \nThe stress intensity range (\u0394K) and stress ratio (R) is then computed as[47]: \nK Kmax Kmin K load\/max K load\/min , R\nKmin\nKmax\n (8) \n \nIn this approach only R changes and \u0394K remains unaffected by the residual stresses. The \napplied \u0394K for an M(T) specimen with the dimensions given in Figure 1 and loaded at a \nmaximum load of 60.2 MPa and an R of 0.1 is given in Fig. 11a (standard solution for a \nthrough-crack) . The evolution of R is compared with the externally-applied R in Fig. \n11b. It can be seen that a considerable mean stress effect can be expected.  \n \nThe fatigue crack growth rate was predicted using the NASGRO equation.

The data is \ncompared with prediction of the FCGR without including the effect of the residual \nstresses. It can be seen that the residual stresses accelerate the fatigue crack growth rate \nconsiderably. \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n 19 \n \n6. Discussion \n \nIn prior work [28] the residual stress re-distribution in a VPPA-welded M(T) specimen \nwas investigated. In that work the specimen was loaded at constant \u2206K = 6 MPa\u221am. The \nmacroscopic stress redistribution also appeared to be elastic in that case. The current \nexperiment was mainly carried out to investigate if this also was valid for a MIG weld, \nbut more importantly whether a specimen loaded with a constant load \u2013 i.e., increasing \n\u2206K with crack length \u2013 would show residual stresses re-distribution governed by the \nelastic re-distribution of the initial residual stress field or be affected by the plasticity \ninduced during. \n \nThe measured residual stresses were seen to initially increase with crack length and then \nat long crack lengths to decrease (Fig. 5). The modelled elastic redistribution of the initial \nresidual stress field showed the same characteristics. This indicates that the residual stress \ndistribution with fatigue crack growth is governed by elastic redistribution, and that the \nlocal crack tip stresses and the associated plastic zone have a minor significance, at least \nat this level of resolution.  \n \nThe measured residual stress peaks were seen to be slightly further out from the weld \ncentre than the modelled stresses (Fig. 5). This might be due to the effect of crack tip \nplasticity, which pushes the peaks stresses forward[30]. There may also be an effect \nbecause the crack length was measured with Fractomat gauges, which is not a precision \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n 20 \ntechnique.  The slight overestimation of the peak stresses might also be due to plastic \neffects which were not included in the FE model. Plasticity was not included as one of \nthe objectives of this study was to investigate if linear elastic fracture mechanics can be \nused in the prediction of the FCGR in the presence of a strong residual stress field.   \n \nThe apparent compressive stress in the wake of the crack must however be due to a \nmeasurement error, as the these stresses are not relieved when the specimen is loaded to \nthe maximum load in the fatigue cycle (Fig. 6). From this figure it can also been seen that \nelastic superposition seems to be valid as modelling and the measurement are in good \ncorrelation.  The stresses in an identical specimen without residual stresses at the \nmaximum load at the fatigue cycle were estimated by subtracting the measured stresses at \nPmax with the stresses at zero load.  The good agreement with the modelled stresses in the \nbody at the maximum load without any residual stresses and this estimate also indicates \nthat elastic superposition is valid. \n \nHowever, it has to be highlighted that when referring to plasticity effects on the residual \nstresses, the important condition in this context \u2013 the effect on the fatigue crack growth \nbehaviour \u2013 is that the plasticity does not re-distribute the residual field differently \ncompared with stress arising from an external load.  It is therefore only necessary to \nimplicitly include plasticity by use of the empirical fatigue crack growth laws derived \nfrom fatigue data where plasticity is obviously present.  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n 21 \nThe residual stresses would be expected to induce a significant mean stress effect and this \nis seen as an accelerated fatigue crack growth rate in the M(T) specimen compared with \nthe parent material data (Fig. 7). \n \nThis increase was also expected, as both the Greens function and FE models of the \nresidual stress intensity factor evolution with crack extension showed a high positive \nvalue (Fig. 9). It can also been seen that the relation between the difference between the \nmeasured stresses at the maximum load and the residual stresses in the unloaded \ncondition (Fig. 6) is in the same order of magnitude as the relation between the applied \nstress intensity factor (Fig. 10a) and the residual stress intensity factor (Fig. 9). This \nreinforces the validity of the residual stress intensity factor computation. \n \nThe predicted FCGR in the welded M(T) specimens agreed well with the experimental \nresults.  The solution was however slightly conservative, and more so at shorter crack \nlengths.  This might be due the microstructural changes in the weld and in the transition \nbetween the HAZ and the parent material, which are not included in the model at this \ntime. \n \n7. Concluding remarks \n \n1.

The results have been compared with the predicted stress relaxation \nfrom an elastic finite element model. \n \n2. The effect of the weld residual stress field on fatigue crack growth rate has been \npredicted using FE and Green\u2019s function approaches. Improved correlation with the \nexperimentally-observed crack growth rates is obtained when the residual stresses are \nincluded in the crack growth model. \n \n3. The re-distribution of the residual stress field can be predicted with good accuracy \nusing the assumption of elastic re-distribution only. Therefore the plasticity associated \nwith the fatigue crack growth has only a minimal effect on the residual stress \nredistribution. \n \n4. It can hence be concluded that the evolution of the residual stresses at this level of \nresolution are governed by elastic re-distribution even at constant load, and that linear \nelastic fracture mechanics can be used successfully in the assessment of the fatigue \nbehaviour if the initial residual stress field in the component is known. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nCDML is grateful for financial support to Airbus UK, Alcoa and Cytec.

The crack length values have been \naveraged and rounded for clarity, although the crack growth was found to be highly \nsymmetric.. Modelled data are also plotted, and are discussed in section 4. The number in \nthe legends corresponds to the crack length in mm. The 0 legend points correspond to the \ndata measured along the un-cracked path. \n \nFig. 6 Comparison between the longitudinal stresses in the unloaded condition and at \nPmax at crack lengths of a) 7 mm and b) 20 mm, for both measured and modelled results. \nData is shown for the residual stress with no load (RS); residual stress plus applied load \n(P + RS); and for the effects of the load (obtained directly from the FEA, and by \nsubtracting the difference between the loaded and unloaded experimental data. \n \nFig. 7 Experimentally measured fatigue crack growth rate in the M(T) specimen. The \nexperimental data is also compared with the prediction of the fatigue crack growth rate, \nwith and without taking into account the residual stresses. The procedures for the \npredictions are explained in section 5.2.  \n \nFig. 8 Modelled and measured initial un-cracked stress distribution in the longitudinal \ndirection \n \nFig. 9 Mesh convergence of stresses averaged over the gauge volume (at 17 mm crack \nlength).   \n \nFig. 10 Evolution of Kres with crack position from the weld centre for the M(T) specimen \n(comparison between FEA and weight function approaches) \n \nFig. 11 a) Applied \u0394K and b) Evolution of the effective R with crack growth from the \nweld centre for the M(T) specimen \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nFigure 1\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nFigure 2\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nFigure 3\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nFigure 4a\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nFigure 4b\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nFigure 5a\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nFigure 5b\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nFigure 5c\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nFigure 5d\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nFigure 5e\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nFigure 6a\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nFigure 6b\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nFigure 7\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nFigure 8\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nFigure 9\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nFigure 10\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nFigure 11a\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nFigure 11b\n"}
