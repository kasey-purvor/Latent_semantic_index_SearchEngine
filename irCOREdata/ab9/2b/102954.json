It also has a number of non-\nhomeostatic functions, including cell cycle regulation through the p38 MAPK pathway, and recent\nstudies have indicated that it is required for Ca2+ mediated growth arrest in pancreatic carcinoma\ncells. Some pancreatic cancers produce pathogenic amounts of parathyroid like hormones,\nhowever, which significantly increase Ca2+ plasma concentrations and might be expected to block\nfurther cell growth. In this study we have investigated the expression and function of the p38 MAPK\nsignaling pathway in Ca2+ sensitive (T3M-4) and insensitive (FA6) pancreatic cancer cell lines. FA-6\ncells, which are derived from a pancreatic adenocarcinoma that secretes a parathyroid hormone\nrelated peptide, exhibit only very low levels of p38 MAPK expression, relative to T3M-4 cells.\nTransfecting FA-6 cells with a p38 MAPK expression construct greatly increases their sensitivity to\nCa2+. Furthermore, the reduction of p38 MAPK in T3M-4 cells significantly reduces the extent to\nwhich high levels of Ca2+ inhibit proliferation. These results suggest that the low levels of p38 MAPK\nexpression in FA-6 cells may serve to reduce their sensitivity to high concentrations of external\nCa2+ that would otherwise block proliferation.\nBackground\nThe Calcium -Sensing Receptor (CaR) was cloned a dec-\nade ago, and has proven to be an important component\nin Ca2+ homeostasis through its regulation of parathyroid\nhormone (PTH [1]). It also has a number of non-homeo-\nstatic functions including the control of ion channels and\nhormone secretion, and also in the regulation of cell cycle\nevents [2]. Most notably, Ca2+ stimulation of CaR pro-\nmotes the proliferation of osteoblasts [3] and fibroblasts\n[4], together with a number of malignant cell types\nincluding myeloma and ovarian surface cancer [5], prob-\nably through activation of the EGF receptor [6]. Con-\nversely, the growth of some cells is blocked, including\ncolonic [7] and some pancreatic carcinomas [8]. In each\ncase signaling through CaR is mediated by a specific\nMitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, char-\nacterized by and dependant upon p38 MAPK.\nHypercalcaemia due to the degradation of bone matrix by\nosteoclasts is commonly associated with a number of\nPublished: 01 November 2006\nMolecular Cancer 2006, 5:51 doi:10.1186\/1476-4598-5-51\nReceived: 06 September 2006\nAccepted: 01 November 2006\nThis article is available from: http:\/\/www.molecular-cancer.com\/content\/5\/1\/51\n\u00a9 2006 Morgan et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. \nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Page 1 of 6\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nMolecular Cancer 2006, 5:51 http:\/\/www.molecular-cancer.com\/content\/5\/1\/51malignancies, most notably those of the breast [9], lung\n[10], testis and kidney [11], although it is also a feature of\nsome pancreatic cancers [12]. The mechanism frequently\nunderlying this process is the secretion of PTH-related\npeptide (PTHrP) by cancer cells [13]. This activates oste-\noblast cells that in turn promote osteoclasts to degrade the\nbone matrix, releasing large amounts of Ca2+. High\nCa2+concentrations then stimulate further PTHrP secre-\ntion, resulting in increasingly severe bone loss and hyper-\ncalcaemia, and in many cases promotes further tumour\ngrowth [13,14].\nIn view of the generalized anti-proliferative effect of Ca2+\non pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells (PACs), it is surpris-\ning that some PACs actually secrete high levels of PTHrP,\nthereby promoting hypercalcaemia. Here we compare two\nPAC derived cell lines, FA-6 [12] and T3M-4 [15], which\nhave similar characteristic except that FA-6 secretes high\nlevels of PTHrP [12]. Our results indicate that the relative\ninsensitivity of FA-6 cells to Ca2+ is mediated by a consti-\ntutively low level of p38 MAPK expression in these cells.\nMaterials and methods\nCell culture and treatment\nFA-6 and T3M-4 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 sup-\nplemented with 10% FBS, 1% P\/S and 1% B16 granulo-\ncyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF)\nconditioned media, and incubated at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2.\nP38 MAPK transfection\nThe full length reading frame of p38 MAPK (NM_002745)\nwas amplified by PCR and cloned into the pCMV-script\nvector (Stratagene, USA) to give pCMVp38+. As a control,\nwe also cloned the p38 MAPK reading frame lacking the\nATG translation start site (pCMVp38). Transfections for\nboth FA-6 and T3M-4 were performed in 35 mm plates\nwith cells at 80% confluency. 2 \u03bcg of each vector were\nused per plate, together with 6 \u03bcl of GeneJammer transfec-\ntion reagent (Stratagene, USA), with other conditions as\ndescribed in the manufacturer's protocol.\nRNA extraction and RT-QPCR\nTotal RNA was extracted from FA-6 or T3M-4 cells using\nan RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). 1 \u03bcg of RNA was used in\nsubsequent reverse transcription reactions. This was\nmixed with a poly T15 oligo to 5 \u03bcg\/ml and heated to\n75\u00b0C for 5 minutes. After cooling on ice, the following\nadditional reagents were added; dNTPs to 0.4 mM, RNase\nOUT (Promega) to 1.6 u\/\u03bcl, Moloney Murine Leukemia\nVirus Reverse Transcriptase (M-MLRvT) RnaseH- point\nmutant (Promega) to 8 u\/\u03bcl and the appropriate buffer\n(supplied by the manufacturer) to x1 concentration. The\nmixture was incubated for one hour at 37\u00b0C, heated to\n70\u00b0C for two minutes and cooled on ice.\nQPCR reactions were all performed in a total volume of\n50 \u03bcl. For each we used 1 \u03bcl of the M-MLRvT reaction (as\ndescribed above), 0.2 nmols of each primer and 25 \u03bcl of\npre-mixed QPCR components (Sigma). All reactions were\ncycled at 94\u00b0C for 30 seconds, 55\u00b0C for 30 seconds and\n72\u00b0C for 60 seconds, for 45 cycles.\nQPCR was performed using the SYBR green labeling kit\nfrom Sigma. Thermal cycling and fluorescence detection\nwas by a MX4000 (Stratagene Inc., USA). Semi-quantita-\ntive data was obtained by using measurements three\ncycles after reactions had risen above the base line, and\nwere clearly in exponential increase. \u03b2-actin was used as a\ncontrol for RNA recovery and cDNA synthesis, and all val-\nues are presented as a ratio of target to \u03b2-actin signal.\nDetection of p38 MAPK protein by western blotting\nWhole cell lystaes were prepared from FA-6 and T3M-4\ncells and 15 \u03bcg was used for each detection. Blotting was\nperformed using the Western Breeze Chemuliminescent\nkit (anti-rabbit, Invitrogen, UK), according to the manu-\nfactures instructions. Primary detection was by a rabbit\nanti-p38 MAPK antibody (ab7952, AbCam, UK), at a final\nconcentration of 0.1 \u03bcg\/ml. Blots were stripped and re-\nprobed with rabbit anti-beta actin (Abcam, UK, ab8227)\nto act as a loading control.\nsiRNA silencing of p38 MAPK in T3M-4 cells\nCultured T3M-4 cells were plated in triplicate the day\nbefore the transfection procedure was started. Pre-vali-\ndated siRNA (Ambion, id # 1634) was transfected at a\nfinal concentration of 100 nM. RNA was extracted from\nthe cells 48 hours after transfection. mRNA levels were\nmeasured by real-time RT-PCR, as described above. As a\npositive control, we also transfected with siRNA to target\nGAPDH, and with a non-targeting siRNA, to act as a neg-\native control. Both of these siRNAs are supplied in the\nAmbion 'siRNA starter kit', which was used for all of the\ntransfections, using the manufacturer's protocol.\nResults and discussion\nIn order to compare the expression of CaR and its down-\nstream signaling components in PTHrP-expressing and\nnon-expressing PAC lines, we selected FA-6 [12] and T3M-\n4 [15]. The former was established from a biopsied lymph\nnode removed from a patient with PAC associated with\nhumoral hypercalcaemia of malignancy, and secretes\nboth PTHrP together with a TNF\u03b1-type bone reabsorbing\nactivity. Likewise, T3M-4 was also established from a\nbiopsied lymph node taken from a PAC patient, but\nunlike FA-6, T3M-4 is not known to secrete a bone-reab-\nsorbing activity.\nIn order to assess the transcription of CaR and its down-\nstream signaling components, we extracted RNA fromPage 2 of 6\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nMolecular Cancer 2006, 5:51 http:\/\/www.molecular-cancer.com\/content\/5\/1\/51T3M-4 and FA-6 cells in culture. The relative amounts of\nspecific transcripts in this pathway were then determined\nby quantitative PCR (QPCR). In brief, this pathway con-\nsists of CaR itself linked via an adaptor protein (Grb-2) to\na guanine exchange factor (GEF), which upon Ca2+ signal-\ning catalyses the exchange of GTP for GDP by membrane\nbound Ras protein. GTP-bound Ras then activates MAP3K\nthat in turn phosphorylates and thereby activates MAP2K,\nand this then activates p38 MAPK in the same manner (Fig\n1; reviewed in ref [16]). The QPCR results indicate that\nwhilst the majority of the CaR signaling pathway compo-\nnents, including CaR itself, are expressed at essentially the\nsame level in the two different cell lines, p38 MAPK is spe-\ncifically downregulated in FA-6 cells. The difference in\nexpression levels is approximately 8 fold. This difference\nis also reflected at the protein level, as western blotting\nwhole cell protein extracts from both cell lines reveals a\nsignificantly lower expression of p38 MAPK protein in FA-\n6 cells (Fig 2).\nThe relatively low level of p38 MAPK expression in FA-6\ncells suggests that FA-6 cells could have a different Ca2+\nThe relative expression of components in the CaR\/p38 MAPK signaling cascade, as determined by QPCR in FA-6 (F) and T3M-4 (T) p ncreatic carcinoma cell linesFigu e 1\nThe relative expression of components in the CaR\/p38 MAPK signaling cascade, as determined by QPCR in FA-6 (F) and T3M-\n4 (T) pancreatic carcinoma cell lines.

In order to test this, we meas-\nured the proliferation of cells in the presence of low (0.5\nmM) and high (4 mM) Ca2+ (Fig 3). Although the rate of\nproliferation is similar for both cell types at the lower con-\ncentration, a higher concentration of Ca2+ causes a signif-\nicant reduction in T3M-4 proliferation but not of FA-6\nproliferation. To test whether the relatively low expression\nof p38MAPK could be responsible for this difference, we\ntransfected FA-6 cells with a vector containing the full\nlength reading frame of p38MAPK (pCMVp38+), or with\none containing the same insert but without the ATG start\ncodon (pCMVp38-) to act as a control.

To address this, we targeted p38 MAPK in T3M-4\ncells using a sequence specific short interfering RNA\n(siRNA). This resulted in a substantial (72%) reduction in\np38 MAPK RNA, as measured by RT-QPCR (Fig 6), and a\ncorresponding reduction in p38 MAPK protein (Fig 7).\nT3M-4 cells treated in this way showed a reduced sensitiv-\nity to Ca2+ mediated inhibition of proliferation, whilst\nuntreated cells and those treated with a non-targeting\nsiRNA did not (Fig 8).\nThe analysis of differential transcription between cells and\ntissues is becoming increasingly important in diagnosis\nand prognosis, and also in understanding the physiology\nof different cell types. Studies using micro array based\napproaches have indicated that changes in the transcrip-\ntion of relatively small groups of genes may underlie the\ndifference between normal and malignant states [17], and\nthat these genes can be subdivide into functional distinct\nsubclasses, for example those involved in proliferation\nand growth. In this study, we show that a single, stable\ntranscriptional change between different pancreatic carci-\nnoma cell lines may influence their response to distinct\nenvironmental signals, in this case the extracellular con-\ncentration of Ca2+. This change is in the transcription of\np38 MAPK, a key component of the CaR-mediated prolif-\nerative\/anti-proliferative affect of Ca2+ [18]. It is intrigu-\ning that p38 MAPK should be so strongly downregulated\nin FA-6 cells, which are derived from a tumour that both\nCells transfected with siRNA targeting p38 MAPK show sig-nificantly increased prol feration in he resence of 4 mM a2+Figure 8\nCells transfected with siRNA targeting p38 MAPK show sig-\nnificantly increased proliferation in the presence of 4 mM \nCa2+.
