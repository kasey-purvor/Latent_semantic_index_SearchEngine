Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is part of the global carbon 34 \ncycle, ecologically and geochemically active, and costly to remove in water treatment.  35 \nSpectroscopic monitoring at a single wavelength provides some indication of DOM 36 \nconcentration, but variations in optical properties mean that accurate determinations 37 \ncurrently rely on slow and costly laboratory methods.  We show that for water samples 38 \ncontaining non-anthropogenic DOM, ultraviolet absorbance at two wavelengths can 39 \nquantify DOM rapidly, cheaply and accurately, and also indicate its quality. 40 \n 3\nAbstract.  A two-component model permitted the precise simulation of ultraviolet 41 \nabsorption by 23 contrasting surface-water DOM samples.  Although a unique set of 42 \nmodel parameters could not be established, the results could still be used to predict 43 \n[DOC] in water samples simply from absorbance values at two wavelengths (we used 44 \n254 and 340 nm).  The parameterised model was used to predict [DOC] for a separate 45 \ndataset obtained by combining results for 12 samples each from a UK river draining 46 \nupland pasture, UK groundwaters from a range of formations, stream and lake waters 47 \nfrom a forested region of Ontario, and high-altitude alpine and subalpine streams from 48 \nColorado.  A close correlation (R2 = 0.997) was obtained, with only slight 49 \nunderestimation of the true [DOC].  Precise prediction of [DOC] from absorbance data at 50 \na single wavelength was not possible, because of differences in DOM extinction 51 \ncoefficients among the samples.  When the model was applied to samples collected from 52 \nriver locations in a heterogeneous UK catchment with areas of industry and high human 53 \npopulation, [DOC] was underestimated in many cases, which may indicate the presence 54 \nof non-absorbing pollutant DOM. 55 \n 56 \nKeywords.  dissolved organic carbon - dissolved organic matter \u2013 two-component model 57 \n\u2013 UV spectra 58 \n 59 \nDissolved organic matter (DOM) is a ubiquitous collection of components in surface, soil 60 \nand ground waters, comprising the partial decomposition products of living material, 61 \nchiefly plants and algae, but also derived from agricultural, industrial and domestic 62 \nhuman activities.  Differences in source material and rates of decomposition, and physical 63 \nfractionation processes, generate substantial heterogeneity in DOM concentrations and 64 \nproperties.  DOM participates in many ecological and geochemical reactions, and is costly 65 \nto remove from water intended for domestic and industrial supply.  Interest in the 66 \nformation and transport of DOM has intensified because of widespread increases in DOC 67 \nconcentrations and fluxes seen over recent years[1], with possible links to changes in the 68 \nterrestrial carbon cycle.  Routine methods for the accurate determination of DOM in 69 \ndifferent samples are based on the measurement of DOC, usually after conversion to 70 \nCO2.  This requires the return of samples to the laboratory, and is both time-consuming 71 \nand fairly expensive.  Optical absorbance at a single wavelength in the UV-visible range 72 \nusually correlates strongly with [DOC], and is therefore often used to monitor natural 73 \nDOM.  However, differences in DOM properties among waters, and temporally within a 74 \ngiven water, mean that this can only be an approximate method.  Indeed, variation in 75 \nthe ratio of absorbance to [DOC] is widely used to characterise the quality of DOM, 76 \nnotably through the specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA)[2]. 77 \n 4\nThe measure of optical properties used here is the extinction coefficient (E; also referred 78 \nto as specific absorbance and specific absorptivity) obtained as the ratio of optical 79 \nabsorbance at a given wavelength (\u03bb nm) to [DOC], and with units of l g-1 cm-1.  Thacker 80 \net al.[3] determined the extinction coefficients of 23 concentrated samples of DOM from a 81 \nvariety of surface waters in northern England.  They demonstrated a monotonic increase 82 \nof the E340\/E254 ratio with E340 (Figure 1), which suggests that [DOC] can be deduced 83 \nfrom absorbance data alone, by the following argument.  For a given water sample, the 84 \nE340\/E254 ratio is exactly the same as the ratio of optical absorbances A340\/A254 since both 85 \nmeasurements refer to the same [DOC].  Therefore the A340\/A254 ratio of the sample 86 \ncorresponds to a single value of E340, which can be divided into A340 to obtain [DOC].  If 87 \nthe monotonic relationship of Figure 1 applies generally, optical absorbance values at two 88 \nwavelengths offer a means to estimate [DOC] accurately, despite variations in sample 89 \nextinction coefficients at the individual wavelengths. 90 \nIn fact, the relationship in Figure 1 is expected for a two-component system.  The 91 \nextinction coefficient at any wavelength is given by 92 \nE\uf06c =  fA E\uf06c,A + fB E\uf06c,B =  fA E\uf06c,A + (1 - fA) E\uf06c,B   (1) 93 \nwhere fA and fB are the fractions of components A and B (fA + fB = 1).  For the 23 94 \nsamples studied by Thacker et al.[3] there are 46 versions of this equation if two 95 \nwavelengths are considered, and 23 values of fA.  We treated the fA values and the four 96 \nextinction coefficients as adjustable parameters, and used Microsoft Excel Solver to 97 \noptimise them by minimizing the sum of the squares of (E\uf06c,obs-E\uf06c,calc)\/E\uf06c,obs.  Excellent fits 98 \ncould be obtained, with average differences between observed and calculated values <  99 \n2%, thereby supporting the two-component hypothesis.  However, the model is 100 \noverparameterised and so a unique parameter set cannot be obtained from this relatively 101 \nsmall data set.   102 \nWe constrained the model by specifying the value of E254,A to be 60 l g-1 cm-1 (equivalent 103 \nto 6.0 l mg-1 m-1 in commonly used SUVA units).  This can be justified from the SUVA 104 \nvalues of isolated DOM[2] and from the results of streamwater surveys at a variety of 105 \nlocations[3-8].  In none of these reports is a SUVA value exceeding 6.0 l mg-1 m-1 106 \nreported, although values exceeding 5.0 l mg-1 m-1 are not uncommon[3,4,7,8].  Therefore 107 \nwe can make the reasonable approximation that an E254 value of 60 l g-1 cm-1 represents 108 \nan end-member, i.e. the sample in question is entirely component A.  Refitting the model 109 \nwith E254,A set to 60 l g-1 cm-1, and using data for three wavelengths (254, 280, 340 nm) 110 \nto increase the ratio of observations to parameters, reduced the range of parameter sets 111 \nthat fitted the model.  Consistent values of E254,A, E280,A and E340,A were now obtained, but 112 \nranges of values of E254,B, E280,B and E340,B, combined with different sets of fA values, gave 113 \nequally good fits.  The same goodness-of-fit was obtained for any value of E254,B in the 114 \n 5\nrange 14 to 22 l g-1 cm-1, since the other model parameters could change to compensate 115 \n(Table 1).  Outside this range of E254,B however, the fits were always worse.  Although 116 \nfixing E254,A reduces the parameter ranges that can fit the data, the prediction of [DOC], 117 \n(see below), is not affected.  However, constraining the parameters to physically realistic 118 \nvalues may lead to useful correlations with other DOM physico-chemical properties. 119 \nAny of the sets of extinction coefficients shown in Table 1, or indeed any intermediate 120 \nset, can be used to compute fA in a new water sample from the following equation, 121 \nobtained by combining the versions of equation (1) for each wavelength; 122 \nfA = (E\u03bb1,B - R E \u03bb2,B) \/ (R E \u03bb2,A - R E \u03bb2,B - E \u03bb1,A + E \u03bb1,B)   (2) 123 \nwhere R is the ratio of optical absorbance values (A \u03bb1\/A \u03bb2) for the sample in question.  124 \nThe value of fA can be substituted into equation (1) to obtain E\u03bb1 and E\u03bb2 for the sample, 125 \nwhich can then be divided into either A\u03bb1 or A\u03bb2 respectively to obtain [DOC].   126 \nWe used E254,A, E254,B E340,A and E340,B to predict [DOC] for a set of 48 data assembled 127 \nfrom the results of monitoring by four separate research organisations.  The field 128 \nlocations were judged to be free of local anthropogenic influences, and none of the 129 \nsamples was noticeably turbid.  Samples from the River Tarnbrook were collected by the 130 \nCentre for Ecology and Hydrology as part of a river monitoring programme on the Ribble-131 \nWyre catchment of north-west England (see below).  The river drains an area of upland 132 \npasture with low human population.  The water samples were passed through Whatman 133 \nGF\/F glass-fibre filters (0.7 \u03bcm nominal size cut-off), concentrations of DOC were 134 \ndetermined by a combustion method using a Shimadzu TOC-VCPH instrument, and 135 \nabsorption spectra were measured with an Agilent 8453 diode array instrument.  The 136 \nBritish Geological Survey collected groundwater samples from piezometers or where they 137 \nemerged as springs from formations in the UK.  Samples for DOC and absorbance 138 \nanalysis were filtered using silver filters (0.45 \u03bcm Millipore\u2122) and analysed using a 139 \nThermalox\u2122 C analyser after acidification and sparging (DOC) and a Varian\u2122 140 \nspectrophotometer (optical absorbance).  Trent University collected stream and lake 141 \nsamples from a forested region of the Precambrian Shield in Ontario; the data used here 142 \nrefer to November 2007.  Samples were filtered with MilliporeTM 0.45 \u03bcm membrane 143 \nfilters, and analysed for DOC (Shimadzu TOC-VPH) and optical absorbance (Cary 59 144 \nUV\/Vis spectrophotometer).  Colorado samples were collected from alpine and subalpine 145 \nstream sites in the Green Lakes Valley and adjacent Como Creek watershed.  The Green 146 \nLakes Valley is part of the Niwot Ridge Long Term Ecological Research (NWTLTER) site 147 \nand is not influenced by direct human impacts. Samples were filtered with Whatman GF\/F 148 \nglass-fibre filters (0.7 \u03bcm nominal pore size), DOC was measured by high temperature 149 \ncatalytic oxidation with a Shimadzu 5050A TOC analyzer, and absorption spectra were 150 \nmeasured on an Agilent 8453 UV-visible spectroscopy system.  Twelve data points were 151 \n 6\nused for each sub-set, this being the total available for the River Tarnbrook; values from 152 \nthe other sub-sets were chosen at random.  153 \nValues of A254 and A340 for each sample were used to calculate fA from equation (2) using 154 \ncalibrated extinction coefficients, then the overall sample extinction coefficients E\uf06c were 155 \ncalculated with equation (1), and [DOC] obtained from the ratio A254\/E254.  156 \nIndistinguishable results were obtained whichever of the three parameter sets of Table 1 157 \nwas used.  The model predicted [DOC] well (Figure 2), with R2=0.997 and a root-mean-158 \nsquared-deviation (RMSD) of 0.7 mg l-1.  The slope of 0.98 and intercept of -0.3 mg l-1 159 \n(significant at p<0.01) result in slight underestimation of [DOC] on average, and a 160 \nproportionately greater error at low [DOC].  The calculated values of fA differed among 161 \nthe sub-sets; with E254,B set to 18 l g-1 cm-1, the averages were 0.86 for the River 162 \nTarnbrook, 0.18 for the groundwaters, 0.42 for the Ontario samples, and 0.46 for the 163 \nColorado samples.  Of course the absolute fA values depend upon the choice of E254,B, but 164 \ntheir relative order is always the same.   165 \nAn important feature of the data sub-sets is that they differ appreciably in their 166 \nextinction coefficients at a single wavelength.  For each sub-set there is quite a strong 167 \ncorrelation of A254 with [DOC] (Figure 2), but the slopes and intercepts differ noticeably; 168 \nthe results are still more divergent at 340 nm.  Use of the A254 regression for the full data 169 \nset (R2=0.955) to predict [DOC] produces an RMSD of 1.86 mg l-1, more than twice the 170 \nvalue from the two-component model.   171 \nA study by CEH and Lancaster University of the catchments of the Rivers Ribble and 172 \nWyre has involved fortnightly sampling of 26 representative river sites (including the 173 \nRiver Tarnbrook site of Figure 2) in north-west England.  The total catchment area of 174 \n1920 km2 has a wide range of agricultural land-uses, including pasture, arable and 175 \nupland moorlands.  There are also several intensely urban locations in the main towns of 176 \nAccrington, Blackburn and Burnley, as well as considerable current industrial activity and 177 \nthe legacy of past heavy industry.  We analysed 251 samples collected over the period 178 \nOctober 2008 to February 2009, using the methods described above for the River 179 \nTarnbrook.  As shown by Figure 3, the model underestimates [DOC] in many cases, but 180 \nthere are only two significant overestimates, and even these are probably outliers.   The 181 \nfact that the cloud of data points has a well-defined upper edge that corresponds to the 182 \n1:1 line suggests that the model provides good estimates of \u201cnatural\u201d [DOC] but, 183 \ninevitably, fails to predict concentrations of non-absorbing DOM produced by human 184 \nactivities.  From the results, excluding likely outliers, the average non-absorbing [DOC] is 185 \n1.3 mg l-1, with a 5\/95 percentile range of 0.2\/3.3 mg l-1.  Note that interference by 186 \nnitrate, the most common non-DOM chromophoric compound in surface waters[9], is 187 \nunlikely to be serious in these samples, since the highest nitrate concentration in these 188 \n 7\nwaters is c. 7 mg l-1, which would add less than 0.5 mg l-1 to [DOC] estimated 189 \nspectroscopically.  The three parameter sets of Table 1 gave nearly identical results. 190 \nThe spectral analysis described here is a simple idea that has apparently not been 191 \nproposed before, although there are some relevant reports.  Mattson et al.[10] used 192 \nabsorbance at 546 nm to correct values at 254 nm for turbidity.  Simonsson et al.[11] 193 \nperformed Principal Components Analysis on absorbance data in the range 210-300 nm 194 \nto estimate [DOC] and [nitrate] in different forest floor leachates, but the samples did 195 \nnot vary greatly in DOM quality and so a generally-applicable model was not derived.  196 \nDowning et al.[12] used absorbance data only in the visible range (412-715 nm) to derive 197 \na statistical model for samples from a tidal wetland, but this covered only a small range 198 \nof [DOC] (2.4 \u2013 4.0 mg l-1) and again the range of DOM quality would have been limited.  199 \nThe book edited by Thomas & Burgess[9] devotes a chapter to the UV-visible 200 \nspectroscopy of natural waters[13] which considers \u201chumic like substances\u201d (equivalent to 201 \nthe DOM that we are interested in) and recognises variations in their UV-visible spectra, 202 \nbut does not discuss their absolute quantification from multi-wavelength data.  Therefore 203 \nwe believe that ours is a novel approach. 204 \nOur method is a significant improvement over single-wavelength monitoring, since it can 205 \nprovide accurate estimates of [DOC] for samples with differing DOM quality, at least in 206 \nnatural waters not highly impacted by anthropogenic activities.  The non-zero intercept 207 \nwhen [DOC] predictions are regressed against conventionally-measured values (Figure 2) 208 \nleads to reduced accuracy for samples with low [DOC], which tend to be dominated by 209 \nDOM with weak light absorption, but for [DOC] > c. 2 mg l-1 spectroscopic data alone can 210 \nbe used to determine both concentration and quality rapidly and cheaply.  The true 211 \ndetection limit of the dual-wavelength method remains to be established, in part because 212 \nof inevitable uncertainty in conventionally-determined [DOC].  These findings could 213 \nsignificantly widen the scope of DOM research in both the laboratory and the field, 214 \nincluding the possibility of continuous monitoring in situ, if turbidity influences could be 215 \ntaken into account.  For polluted waters, the model does not provide good estimates of 216 \ntotal [DOC] but may prove useful in distinguishing natural and pollutant DOM.  The 217 \nmethod should be tested on a wider range of DOM and water types, and there is clearly a 218 \nneed to improve the parameterisation, to define component B in particular; as noted 219 \nabove, this might lead to useful correlations with DOM physico-chemical properties.  We 220 \nalso need to understand why a simple two-component model appears to account so well 221 \nfor the complex mixture of compounds that constitute natural DOM. 222 \n 223 \n 224 \n 225 \n 8\nAcknowledgements 226 \nWe thank the staff of the CEH Analytical Chemistry Laboratory and the BGS Wallingford 227 \nLaboratory for assistance in sampling and analysis, and Peter Dillon, Chris Evans, Donald 228 \nMonteith, Philip Rowland and Andrew Scott for helpful discussions.
