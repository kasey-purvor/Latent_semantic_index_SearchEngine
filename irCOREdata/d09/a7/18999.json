The downhill trajectory of \nEnglish university continuing education in the first decade of the twenty-first \ncentury is compared with the apparent buoyancy of the situation in New Zealand \nduring the same period. The paper discusses some of the contextual factors \nwhich may have contributed to sustaining continuing education in New Zealand, \nagainst the tide of developments elsewhere, and in spite its subjection to the \ninfluence of neoliberal policies since the 1980s. These factors include: an ethos \nof public dissemination of knowledge, an acknowledgement of the universities\u2019 \nrole as \u2018critic and conscience\u2019 of society, a broad commitment to educational \nequality and an approach which has been strategic as well as pragmatic. The \npaper describes developments in one New Zealand continuing education \ndepartment between 2006 and 2010 as it experiences further institutional and \npolitical change. The author concludes that, in spite of having demonstrated \nconsiderable resilience, the current structures and activities of continuing \neducation departments in New Zealand are as fragile as they have been shown to \nbe in England. Possible responses to the current situation are discussed and \n\u2018radical hope\u2019 (Brookfield 2005) is advocated as the university-based adult \neducators\u2019 response in difficult times. Radical hope, founded on critical theory, \ninvolves recognising and challenging the assumptions of neoliberalism, as well \nas critical praxis (Carr and Kemmis 1986), and a reaffirmation on the part of \nacademics and adult educators of the political nature of adult education (Freire \n1972; Crowther et al 2005; Martin 2008; Wallace 2008).  \nKey words: University continuing education, higher education, adult and \ncommunity education, Aotearoa New Zealand  \n \nBackground: The landscape of university continuing education \nOver the past thirty years, universities across the globe have had to respond to \ncomplex ideological and policy changes well documented in the higher \neducation literature (Jary and Parker 1998, Bourgeois et al 1999, Barnett 2000, \nOsborne et al 2004, Canaan and Shumar 2008) and which have impacted on the \nmission and funding of universities. Underlying many of these changes has been \nthe ascendance of neoliberalism (Olssen et al 2004, Canaan and Shumar 2008). \nThe logic of neoliberalism is underpinned by a conviction that the market is \nparamount and that the state should take a minimal role in the social realm. In \nthe field of adult education and training, this logic places the responsibility for \neducational participation or non-participation, success or failure on the \nindividual, rather than on government. In this formulation, the valid outcome of \neducation is the development of human capital (Becker 1975). The notion that \nindividuals carry the primary responsibility for investing in their own future \nthrough the accumulation of educational credentials and that this, in turn, will \nproduce benefits for the national economy, has dominated post-compulsory \neducation and training policy since the 1970s. Accordingly, the activities of \nuniversities have increasingly been directed towards profitability, generating \nincome from private and corporate sources, credentialising learning and \ncompeting for students, research prestige and global status (Slaughter and Leslie \n1997).  \n \nUniversity adult and continuing education, whose historical emphasis has been \non offering part-time non-accredited, non-vocational educational opportunities, \nhas not been immune from these changes (McIlroy and Spencer 1988; Taylor \n2005; Jones et al 2010). Historically, university continuing education has \noccupied a marginal position, in the \u2018border country\u2019 (McIlroy and Westwood \n1993) between the university and wider community. This has proved a mixed \nblessing. On the positive side, away from the more rigid structures of the centre \nground in higher education there has, in the past, been room for creative practice \nand flexibility to innovate. There has, in the past, been potential for engaging \nwith individuals and communities who do not form the standard constituency of \nelite universities. Historically too, there has been some freedom from regimes of \naccreditation, enabling people to study for a short period, primarily for personal \ninterest and without the pressure of assessment (Bellis et al 1999, Preece 1999). \nHowever, and particularly in England, this freedom has been largely swept away \nas a result of funding regimes which have excluded informal and non-credit \nbearing adult education (Kogan 2000; Taylor 2005; Duke 2008; Jones et al \n2010). \n \nOn the downside, the border activities of continuing education departments do \nnot always sit comfortably with those of the mainstream of universities, with \ntheir less flexible approaches to student entry, curriculum and assessment. The \nfact that much of the teaching in continuing education departments takes place in \nthe evening or away from main campus activities renders it less visible than the \nstandard academic departments. Teaching in continuing education departments \nhas tended to be undertaken by part time, hourly-paid or temporary staff who \nmay not feel a close association with the aims of the department or the wider \nuniversity. Whilst academics from mainstream university departments may once \nhave been willing to contribute to non credit bearing continuing education \ncourses, this has become less attractive as the emphasis of universities has \nincreasingly been placed on research and publication rather than teaching. \nMeanwhile, academics directly employed in university continuing education \nhave been prone to be regarded as peripheral to the central aims of the university \n(McIlroy and Westwood 1993). Furthermore, academic study in the field of adult \neducation has a comparatively low profile in many universities. In combination, \nthese factors render university continuing education\u2019s position rather precarious, \nparticularly at a time of rapid change in the university sector. \n \nTravelling across the changing landscape \nThis paper arises from the author\u2019s relocation, in 2006, from an English \nuniversity whose continuing education department was in the throes of \nrestructuring and subsequent closure, to a continuing education department in a \nNew Zealand which, on the face of it, seemed to be in considerably better shape. \nIn making the move to a similar setting in a different part of the world there is a \ntemptation to compare and contrast. Whilst over-generalising from comparison \ncan be problematic, it can also be instructive (McLean 1992, 1995; Teichler and \nHanft 2009) to explore the extent to which global trends and \u2018policy borrowing\u2019 \n(Philips 2009) may be mitigated or moderated by the particularities of national \nand cultural contexts.   \n \nNew Zealand and England share aspects of a common heritage as a result of the \nmigration and colonisation of the nineteenth century and the continuing flow of \nworkers, travellers and ideas between the two countries. They share a common \nexperience of the aggressive implementation of neoliberal policy directions \nduring the 1980s and 1990s. There is also, anecdotally, a tendency to assume that \nhistorical links between the two countries, built on a colonial past, imply an \ninevitable transfer of policy from England to New Zealand. However, the \ngeographical, social and cultural differences between the two countries mean \nthat their policy paths do not necessarily always converge (Thrupp 2001). In \ncomparison with England, New Zealand is largely rural, with the exception of a \nsmall number of major centres of population (Auckland and Wellington in the \nNorth Island, Christchurch and Dunedin in the South Island). Its population - at a \nlittle over four million - is small, enabling social networks to flourish, often in \nspite of considerable geographical distance. It is, officially, a bicultural and \nbilingual state; a country in which an indigenous (M\u0101ori) population, a European \nsettler (P\u0101keh\u0101) population and a new migrant population from across the globe \ncoexist within the context of the Treaty of Waitangii\n \n.  \nThe two countries share common traditions in university continuing education. \nIn England it has been driven by diverse and sometimes contradictory \nphilosophical and political perspectives - liberal, socialist, Christian and radical \n(McIlroy and Spencer 1988; Kelly 1992; Thompson 1996; Speight 2004; \nMalcolm and Zukas 2007; Jones et al 2010). Dominant in the discourse of \nEnglish university extramural or continuing adult education has been the notion \nof \u2018The Great Tradition\u2019 (Wiltshire 1956). Wiltshire described this \u2018tradition\u2019 as \ncharacterised by a social science-based curriculum, a tutorial-based pedagogy \nand non-vocational and non-assessed outcomes. Running alongside the liberal \nstrand of university continuing education has been a more radical perspective. \nThat perspective has been characterised by a concern with adult education as a \nmeans of advancing working class interests, extending knowledge to those who \nhave been excluded from its benefits, and of adult education with a social \npurpose \u2013 encouraging social activism and democratic debate (Thompson (ed.) \n1980; McIlroy and Spencer 1988). \n \nUniversity continuing education in New Zealand has its origins in this British \nmodel of liberal and extra-mural adult education. As in England, it has historical \nlinks to the efforts of the Workers\u2019 Education Association to offer non-\nvocational, non-accredited education to working people (Tobias 2001; Findsen \nand Harr\u00e9 Hindmarsh 1996). On the face of it, therefore, the similarities between \nuniversity continuing education in the two countries are compelling.  \n \nWhen I relocated there in 2006, the relative health of New Zealand\u2019s university \ncontinuing education departments, compared with the situation in England, was \nstriking, and seemed worthy of exploration. Information was collected from a \nreview of the literature of continuing education in both countries over the past 30 \nyears, from conversations with practitionersii and from personal observation of \ndevelopments in university continuing education in England and New Zealand \nbetween 2006 and 2010. \n \nGoing downhill: English continuing education since the 1980\u2019s \nAs early as 1956, Harold Wiltshire suggested that the Great Tradition of adult \neducation in England might have had its day: that increased educational \nopportunities and a more vocational thrust were eroding its mission and the \nforms of pedagogic practice which he advocated. Twenty years later, James \nCallaghan\u2019s (then British Prime Minister) Ruskin College Speech (1976) \nsignalled a more \u2018hands on\u2019 approach by government to educational issues: \nquestioning the value of informal teaching methods, asserting the desirability of \na core curriculum and stressing the need for education to respond to the demands \nof industry. Callaghan\u2019s speech was an early hint that human capital arguments \nwere gaining sway, signalling a shift to a more instrumental approach to \neducation policy, which would surely impact on adult education too.  \n \nLiberal adult education in England became seriously vulnerable to attack from \nthe early 1980\u2019s when Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Conservative government, bent on \nneoliberal reform, began to assert a strongly instrumentalist and individualised \nvision for education and training and to tighten funding controls on university \nadult education. Taylor (2005) and Jones et al (2010) have traced some of the \nsocial and policy developments impacting on continuing education in British \nuniversities during this period: the growing emphasis on professional \ndevelopment and vocational education; the focus on young people entering full-\ntime higher education at the expense of adult and part-time provision; and the \ntendency to equate education with certification which led to the withdrawal of \ngovernment funding for non-accredited education (Moseley in Jones et al 2010), \nrendering it accessible in the main only to those who could afford to pay for it in \nfull. At the same time, government attacks on workers\u2019 organisations (McIlroy \n1995) undermined the links between adult education and trade unionism. The \nresponses of university continuing education departments were varied but on the \nwhole pragmatic and included developing accredited courses and professional \ndevelopment programmes as well as dabbling in access to higher education and \nforging stronger business and community links. \n \nDiscussion around the decline of university continuing education in England \nduring the 1980s and 1990s (McIlroy and Spencer 1988; Mayo and Thompson \n1995; Thompson 1997; Taylor 1996, 2005; Jones et al 2010) lays bare \ndifferences in philosophical and political perspective among university adult \neducators through this period. Jane Thompson and others (Thompson (ed.) 1980; \n1997; Mayo and Thompson 1995) criticised the complacency and elitism of \nuniversity adult educators and their tendency to bend to accommodate New \nRight agendas. In capitulating to government policy changes, Thompson (1997: \n129-133) has argued, adult educators in the liberal tradition helped to pave the \nway for neoliberalism and betrayed adult education as critical praxis. Attacked \nfrom the right and critiqued from the left, liberal university continuing education \nin England became increasingly beleaguered.  \n \nA change of government in 1997 did not signal a revival in continuing \neducation\u2019s fortunes. The New Labour government\u2019s widening participation \nagenda (DfEE 1998; DfES 2003; DfES 2006), which aimed at increasing \nnumbers entering higher education and broadening its social base, resulted in a \nplethora of widening participation funding initiatives for community outreach, \npartnerships with community-based adult education providers and workplace and \nwork-based learning projects (Preece 1998, 1999; Thomas et al 2002; Bowl \n2003). Some of these initiatives were taken up by continuing education \ndepartments. However, when the government\u2019s focus moved away from \nwidening participation across the board to increasing and widening participation \namong 18-30 year-olds entering full-time higher education (DfES 2003), \nuniversity continuing education found itself out in the cold. Between 2005 and \n2009, continuing education departments at Birmingham, Durham, Exeter, Leeds \nand Newcastle Universities were among those which closed, their staff being \neither retired, made redundant or \u2018integrated\u2019 into the mainstream departments of \nthe parent university (Malcolm and Zukas 2007; Duke 2008; Lee 2009; Jones et \nal 2010).  \n \nIn 2008 a further blow was delivered to English university continuing education \nwhen the UK government introduced a new regulation denying funding to \nstudents wishing to study at a level equivalent to, or lower than, that which they \nhave previously attained. The Equivalent or Lower Qualification (ELQ) rule has \nmeant that, having switched much of their activity to accredited courses in order \nto qualify for government funding, continuing education departments have now \nbeen caught in another trap: the ELQ rule has made many would-be participants \nineligible for government subsidy. At the same time, the economic crisis which \nbecame apparent in the UK in the second half of 2008 threatened further to \nundermine adults\u2019 ability to pay full cost for their education and employers\u2019 \nwillingness to sponsor professional development. As a result, there was another \nwave of cutbacks and closures in what were well-established continuing \neducation departments in English universities \u2013 including Bath, Bristol, Bucks \nNew University, Cardiff, City University London, Lancaster, Manchester and \nReading (Stanistreet 2009).  \n \nThese upheavals have not been unique to university-based adult education. \nCommunity- and college-based adult education has been similarly affected. The \ngovernment\u2019s stated policy has been to cut funding for short, personal interest \ncourses - characterised by government representatives as \u2018holiday Spanish and \nflower arranging\u2019 (CALL 2008; The Guardian 2009); in fact ESOL, literacy, \nnumeracy and skills for life courses have also experienced cutbacks. Until \nrecently, there was little in the way of a concerted response at national level to \nthe crisis in adult education in England. It was not until 2008 that a public \ncampaign was launched in its defence. The Campaigning Alliance for Lifelong \nLearning (CALL), a loose alliance of public sector trade unions, student \nrepresentative groups and adult education providers came together to lobby for \nthe maintenance of government support for adult education and for adults\u2019 right \nto access to educational opportunities for \u2018personal wellbeing and development\u2019. \nIn attempting to unite a broad range of providers, the campaign eschews a more \nradical stance in favour of one which supports instrumental and (more mutedly) \nliberal ends. Arguably, the campaign was too little, too late. Reduced subsidies, \nrising charges, instrumentalist agendas, accreditation regimes and \u2018quality\u2019 \ncontrols had already decimated English community-based adult education \n(Taylor 2005); college-based adult education has become increasingly tied into \nvocational training and certification, and universities have all but lost the fight \nfor liberal adult education.  \n \nGoing strong? University Continuing Education in New Zealand  \nIn comparison with England, New Zealand\u2019s continuing education departments \nappeared to be in relatively good heart at the beginning of 2006. Of the eight \nuniversities in New Zealand, four had dedicated centres for continuing education \n\u2013 Auckland, Canterbury, Waikato and Wellington Victoria. A fifth, Otago \nUniversity, which historically had a strong tradition of university extension and \ncommunity outreach, had closed its continuing education department in 1995 \nand implemented a \u2018dispersed\u2019 model of adult continuing education with \nindividual university departments offering public lectures and summer schools to \nthe wider community, whilst the university maintained a small central unit to \nadminister government funding for adult and community education activities. \nAlthough there had been some closures, a good deal of restructuring and \nconsiderable shifts in emphasis in university continuing education over the \nprevious 30 years there was not, in 2006, the sense of decline in the which was \napparent in England.  \n \nAdult and community education (ACE) had struggled to survive a period of \naggressive neoliberalism pursued by the Labour and National governments of the \n1980s and 1990s. Robert Tobias (2004) has described the economic and \neducational upheavals in New Zealand during that time, which brought \neducation face-to-face with market forces and \u2018user pays\u2019 as dominating \nprinciples of higher education policy. However, Tobias (op cit: 573) also \ndiscusses some of the more progressive strands in the policy discourse \n(particularly during the 1984-1990 Labour government).  \n \nFirst, there has historically been an ethos of public knowledge sharing. In 1959, \nthe Hughes Parry Report was urging universities to involve academic staff in \ndisseminating their research publicly via continuing education departments and \nto develop their role in continuing professional development by: \nChannel[ing] the fruits of its investigation and thought, and the thought and research of \nothers, to the informed public at large\u2026[as well as providing] opportunities for the \nperiodic refreshment and \u2018upgrading\u2019 of those who want to keep abreast of scientific and \nsocial change in their fields of special interest  \n                                                                                      (Hughes Parry cited in Tobias 2001:57) \n \nThis commitment to public engagement was discernable in government policy to \nfund public lectures and dissemination events organised by continuing education \ndepartments.  \n \nSecond, in spite of the fact that the 1990 Education Amendment Act \n(http:\/\/www.legislation.govt.nz) laid the ground for a marketised and privatised \ntertiary education system, at the same time it specifically advocated academic \nfreedom and the university\u2019s role as \u2018critic and conscience\u2019 of society. Although \nit may be argued that mere lip-service is paid to this notion (Jones et al 2000), it \nsuggests that there is some room for manoeuvre, in an increasingly business-\ndriven climate, for those seeking to maintain a broader vision of education.  \n \nOther commentators too (Findsen and Harr\u00e9 Hindmarsh 1996; Zepke 2009) \nsuggest that whilst neoliberal economic policies won the day, some space \nremained in the social sphere, in which the idea of egalitarianism and education \nfor a democratic society could still be aired. The struggles of M\u0101ori to challenge \nand change hegemonic educational ideas and structures (Walker 2004) were \nimportant in claiming this space, speaking up for social and cultural aims of \neducation, rather than simply accepting the neoliberal instrumentalism. The \npersistence of these progressive strands may have contributed to the maintenance \nof a role for university continuing education in the New Zealand context. \n \nThird, there has been a stronger history of networking across the adult and \ncommunity education (ACE) sector in New Zealand than has been discernable in \nEngland. ACE Aotearoa, the national organisation for adult education and the \nNational ACE Strategic Alliance have brought together community, school, \npolytechnic and university-based adult education practitioners under a shared \numbrella. And whilst, from time to time, there may have been differences of \nopinion about how the relatively small pool of resources to fund ACE should be \nshared, there has been considerable unity about the need for non-accredited adult \neducation activity which aims to meet personal, social and cultural \u2013 as well as \neconomic \u2013 imperatives. \n \nDuring the New Zealand Labour Party\u2019s most recent period in power, between \n1999 and 2008, there was a resurgence of policy support for a broad \ninterpretation of Adult and Community Education (ACE) which impacted \npositively on university continuing education departments. Koia! Koia! Towards \na Learning Society (TEC 2001) was a landmark report for the ACE sector as a \nwhole. This report reasserted the value of adult learning for a range of personal, \ncommunity and social purposes, and not simply for certification or for \nprofessional advancement. Whilst the overall thrust of education policy in New \nZealand appeared - as in England \u2013 to be focused on skills, qualifications and the \nknowledge economy (TEC 2007), there remained a place in the policy discourse \nfor the achievement of social and cultural goals.  \n \nLeaders of university continuing education departments in New Zealand were \nquick to capitalise on the 1999 Labour government\u2019s \u2018third way\u2019 (Zepke 2009) \napproach to adult education. They cooperated to ensure that their work was \nprotected (Pearman 2007), and gained policy approval for ring-fenced funding \nfor universities\u2019 not-for-credit adult education work. They lobbied for and \nsuccessfully achieved recognition of the \u2018distinctive contribution\u2019 of university \nACE education in: \n\uf0a7 Providing research-informed higher level learning that contributes to the \ncreation of an advanced and rapidly evolving knowledge economy \n\uf0a7 Contributing to the knowledge society through preservation, \ndissemination and application of university research \n\uf0a7 Promoting development of critical and reflective thinking and active, \ninformed citizenship locally, nationally and globally \n\uf0a7 Facilitating pathways into and through university education \n\uf0a7 Building capability in the adult and community education sector  \n        (www.tec.govt.nz) \n \nThis statement of the distinctive contribution of university adult education plays \nto neoliberal and human capital agendas whilst also advancing more liberal, and \nin places progressive, notions of university continuing education. And while \nthose in the wider ACE sector may have felt that it amounted to privileged \ntreatment for a relatively privileged area of the sector, the statement of university \ncontinuing education\u2019s distinctive contribution was helpful in defining the \nboundaries of its work and giving it a sense of security. \n \nGovernment-subsidised short, non-credit-bearing liberal education courses \noffered to local individuals have historically formed the core of the activities of \nuniversity continuing education departments in New Zealand. Over the years, \nand as in England, these departments have diversified to offer a range of \neducational opportunities: professional and executive development, educational \ntravel, conference management, bridging (preparation for higher education) \nprogrammes for domestic and\/or international students, and research, teaching \nand consultancy in the field of adult education and lifelong learning.  \n \nWhilst there is currently some government subsidy for liberal adult education \ncourses and for domestic students undertaking preparatory study, continuing \neducation departments tend to operate on a business model. Some programmes \nearn revenue by offering courses of public or professional interest to various fee-\npaying audiences. Some rely heavily on international fee paying students - \nparticularly those undertaking bridging and English language courses - to \nsubsidise lower revenue-earning programmes. This has enabled departments to \nspread their risks and to offset loss-making areas with more profitable ones, \nwithout necessarily going down the accreditation route wholesale.  \n \nA view from close up \nThe activities of one continuing education department (on New Zealand\u2019s South \nIsland) between 2006 and 2010 illustrate the ways in which university \ncontinuing education in New Zealand, has responded to changing, and \nsometimes conflicting, agendas. In the 1980s its title of Department for \nExtension Studies reflected the British-influenced model of university liberal \neducation reaching out beyond the university\u2019s traditional constituency. In the \nlate 1980s and 1990s, the title Centre for Continuing Education again reflected \nthe liberal adult education ethos. A name change in 2005 to one which combined \nthe university\u2019s initials with the word Opportunity suggested the growing \nentrepreneurial focus of the department\u2019s activities. A negative reaction, among \nstaff and some community based organisations, to this image of commercialism \nresulted in a further name change in 2009, to Continuing & Bridging Education. \nThis may be viewed as an attempt to bring together the diverse activities of the \ndepartment under one, less commercially focused, title and to reposition it as \nmore integral to wider university activities and strategy. Name changes were a \nfeature of the development of university continuing education in England too, \nwhere extramural and extension departments became centres for continuing \neducation, which then transmuted into centres for lifelong learning or centres for \nprofessional and continuing education.  \n \nNotwithstanding the changes of name between 2005 and 2009, a range of \neducational activities and programmes continued to be offered under the banner \nof continuing education, including: \n- Liberal education programmes in a range of arts, humanities and social \nscience subject areas \n- Short training courses in professional and executive development  \n- Professional training for adult educators \n- Bridging (preparation for higher education) courses \n- Tailor made courses for visiting international groups \n- Overseas study tours  \n- Adult education research and consultancy \n \nAt any one time, the department might be attracting local, national and \ninternational funding from a range of private or public sources; it might be \noffering adult education or training for personal, professional, social or cultural \npurposes \u2013 or a combination of these. In spreading effort across a number of \nactivities, with different funding sources, the same pragmatic approach was \ndemonstrated as had been apparent in English university continuing education.  \n \nSuccess in achieving profitability from these diverse activities enabled the \ndepartment to maintain its position as an income-generating enterprise within the \nuniversity. It also enabled it to subsidise less lucrative areas of its work and to \nnurture and develop new initiatives. Among these have been projects with \nclearly social purposes \u2013 education for sustainability, educational initiatives \naimed at supporting the aspirations of new settlers and migrants, work with \nregional and national adult education networks and research and publication in \nthe adult education field.   \n \nAs a result, quite different educational philosophies and approaches have co-\nexisted within one relatively small department. Professional and executive \ndevelopment and international education activities are driven by notions of \neducation as part of a global and local market; bridging education seeks to \nreconcile the international recruitment of high fee-paying students (in a global \neducation market) with a philosophy of equality of opportunity and widening \nparticipation for adult domestic students; partly subsidised university-based \ncourses of liberal education attract well-educated, middle-class audiences \n(Findsen and Harr\u00e9 Hindmarsh 1996), but they have limited resources to \nundertake sustained work in support of more progressive and egalitarian \nphilosophies. While these different approaches may be manageable in a time of \nfinancial and policy security, they are likely to be problematic in more testing \ntimes. When one area of activity suffers a decline in profitability due to changes \nin global markets, government policy or the national economy, or when the \nuniversity decides to cut back on activities that are not regarded as \u2018mainstream\u2019 \nthere may be little to unite the divergent strands within Continuing & Bridging \nEducation. \n \nClouds on the horizon \nIn spite of its apparent buoyancy in 2006, a change of government, pressure on \nuniversity finances, an economic downturn and the continued dominance of \nneoliberalism in education policy, have signalled trouble for university \ncontinuing education in New Zealand. The election of a rightward leaning \nNational Party led coalition government in 2008 meant a return to a more \nstrongly instrumentalist view of adult education. In early 2009, the ACE sector \nwas among the first to experience government funding cuts, in the name of \neconomic stringency and revised priorities. Funding to school-based adult \neducation provision was cut by 80% and support for university-based liberal \nadult education is to be cut by 50% from 2011. What the Minister of Education \nreferred to as \u2018hobby classes\u2019 (Tolley 2009) \u2013 general interest, non-accredited \nliberal education \u2013 were particularly targeted. The Minister\u2019s dismissal of adult \neducation for personal ends echoes the UK government\u2019s disparaging reference \nto \u2018holiday Spanish and flower arranging\u2019 courses as a way of justifying cuts in \nfunding.  \n \nIn New Zealand, as in England, the arguments used to justify cutbacks in adult \neducation fail to take account of the available research on the benefits of a \nbroadly-based conception of adult education (Feinstein et al 2003; Preston et al \n2004; Feinstein et al 2008; Tobias 2009), including its social and political \nbenefits. The rationale for \u2018redirecting\u2019 funding towards addressing numeracy \nand literacy priorities ignores the potential deterrent effects of labelling \nindividuals as deficient and singling them out for educational remediation \n(Tobias 2009). The cuts signal the re-emergence of a nakedly neoliberal line in \nNew Zealand and the new government has unsettled the fragile political \ncertainties which have prevailed in adult education for the previous ten years. \nAnd whilst there has been a spirited defence by ACE sector (Fordyce and Papa \n2009), it has not prevented cuts from being implemented.  \n \nAt the same time, changes in the funding framework for universities \u2013 moving to \na bulk funding, rather than a funding-per-student model \u2013 and a cap on student \nnumbers are likely to leave university departments arguing over their slice of the \nfunding cake. There are already signs that programmes at sub-degree level \n(including domestic bridging or preparatory programmes) are vulnerable to \nbeing numerically capped (TEU press release 29th June 2009). Non-accredited \nliberal adult education courses are also vulnerable, particularly if their \nprofitability is threatened - by a cut in government subsidy, by increased course \nfees (Geertshuis 2009) and by the impact of a recession on people\u2019s ability to \npay. As employers and workers have felt the pinch of the global economic \ndownturn, professional development has been an early casualty of cutbacks, \nwhile the international market for students is vulnerable to policy changes in \nclient countries (particularly in China and the Middle East) as well as to \nworsening economic climates and fluctuating exchange rates.  \n \nUniversity continuing education departments have been subject to recent \nrestructuring in response to changes in the external and institutional \nenvironment. At the particular university described earlier in this paper, the \nappointment of a new Vice-Chancellor in 2009 precipitated a financially-driven \nreview of centrally provided services. Continuing & Bridging Education was \namong the first to feel the effects. The various aspects of its work have been \ndisaggregated: those parts (such as professional and executive education) \nregarded as unprofitable in the current climate have been disestablished. Whilst \n\u2018liberal\u2019 continuing education - in the form of non-accredited public short \ncourses for personal and social interest - remains for the present, it is likely to \nsurvive only as long as it continues to turn a profit from fee paying \u2018customers.\u2019 \nThe prospect is that it will become increasingly divorced from progressive and \negalitarian notions of adult education.  \n \nIn New Zealand until recently there has been a degree of resistance to crude \ninstrumentalism in adult education. The historical and cultural context has \nsustained a consensus around adult education as having social and cultural as \nwell as individual and instrumental purposes. This consensus has been \nunderpinned by discourses of openness, equality and democracy and by the \nstruggles of adult educators (including those working in universities) to maintain \na broad vision of adult education. University continuing education has carved out \na distinctive niche for itself within this consensus \u2013 disseminating university-\ngenerated knowledge to a wider audience, encouraging public debate, \ncontributing to the development of the ACE sector locally and nationally and \nacting as a focal point for adult education teaching and research. At the same \ntime it has responded pragmatically to the neoliberal thrust in educational policy \n\u2013 dabbling in the global educational marketplace, engaging with the notion of the \nknowledge economy and embracing an entrepreneurial approach to adult \neducation provision. As a broad and non-instrumentalist vision of adult and \ncommunity education in New Zealand again comes under attack, university \ncontinuing education seems as vulnerable as it has been in England. The next \nsection of this paper discusses the future prospects for university continuing \neducation in both countries and suggests how academics and adult education \npractitioners might steer a course for university-based adult education through \ndifficult times. \n \nLooking ahead: pragmatism, pessimism or \u2018radical hope\u2019? \nGlobally, educational policy and practice are developing in the wider context of \nneoliberalism. In both England and New Zealand, to differing degrees, adult \neducation has been a casualty of the overwhelming dominance of marketisation, \ncredentialism and instrumentalism in education. Ironically, the marginality of \nuniversity continuing education and its relative protection within the walls of \nacademia may historically have offered some room for manoeuvre (Crowther et \nal 2005; Duke 2008). However, it can no longer successfully stand in isolation \nfrom what is happening in the wider educational landscape. Closures, cutbacks, \nrestructuring, and commodification are reshaping adult education within and \noutside the university. There seem to be three possible responses to the current \nchallenges: pragmatism, pessimism or \u2018radical hope\u2019 (Brookfield 2005). Each of \nthese responses is discussed in turn. \n \nMany working in university continuing education in both England and New \nZealand have attempted to adapt to the changing circumstances by adopting \npragmatic practices, responding to shifts in funding and focus, but broadly \nfollowing the policy leads of successive neoliberal inspired governments. \nChanges of name, changes in direction and engagement with short-term, project-\nbased funding have been understandable reactions of some hard-pressed adult \neducators and managers trying to keep university continuing education \ndepartments afloat. Others have revelled in the opportunity to engage in \neducational entrepreneurialism, seeing such activity as a chance to be a player in \nthe knowledge economy. Such strategies have met with some success in the \nshort and medium term. They have enabled the spreading of financial risk and \nkept continuing education departments on good terms with their parent \nuniversities. In some cases they have enabled expansion and innovative (though \noften short-lived) work has been done in collaboration with community \norganisations and marginalised groups. However, experience seems to \ndemonstrate that strategies driven by pragmatism are not viable in the long run. \nThe more entrepreneurial of such approaches are prone to fall foul of market \nforces. This has been demonstrated by the reliance of some university continuing \neducation departments on charging full costs to individuals or to employers. In \nan economic downturn these activities are likely to founder and leave continuing \neducation departments vulnerable to charges of unprofitability, and therefore ripe \nfor closure.  \n \nGoing with the flow of changing policy regimes for the sake of survival may also \nhave the effect of suppressing debates about aims and purposes of adult and \ncontinuing education (Thompson 1997: 129). Practical concerns to get things \ndone, to \u2018deliver\u2019 courses and to balance the books may distort considerations \nabout whether what is being done is worth doing. In university continuing \neducation this has resulted in a tendency towards conformity and a rhetorical, \nrather than real commitment to education for empowerment and democracy \n(Martin 2008). Alternatively, it may set up divisions about the purposes of adult \neducation or, more mundanely, about how resources should be shared. Such \ndivisions may leave continuing education departments vulnerable to being \ncarved up by universities anxious to make savings.  \n \nA second possible response for those in university continuing education \ndepartments facing restructuring, redeployment or closure, is despair. It is \ntempting to conclude that the countervailing forces are so overwhelming that \nnothing can be done to rescue social and political purpose in education from the \ngrip of rampant individualism and the market. Stephen Brookfield (2005: 8) \nrefers to the danger of radical pessimism in the face of: \u2018the massive twin pillars \nof capitalism and bureaucratic rationality.\u2019 This sense of despair has particularly \npermeated adult education in England, where the thirty years of sustained attacks \nhave taken their toll. It has sometimes engendered nostalgia for the loss of the \n\u2018Great Tradition\u2019 (if there ever was one) of liberal university continuing \neducation. However, as Thompson (1997) argues, to retreat into either \ncapitulation or pessimism is to deny the potential role of adult education in the \nstruggle for ideas and for a more equal world order. \n \nRadical hope (Brookfield 2005) offers a way forward for those in the academy \nwho are committed to a vision of adult education which has as its goal equality \nand democracy. Radical hope proceeds first from a critique of continuing \neducation\u2019s practice, second from an articulation of the fundamental values \nwhich should inform a truly liberatory adult education and third, from the \nbuilding of alliances with other progressive forces \u2013 in the wider adult education \nsector and beyond \u2013 in support an adult education whose curricula and \ninstitutions are accessible to all.  \n \nThompson (1997: 132) has suggested that complacency and elitism have \ncharacterised university liberal education and she has condemned the failure of \nmany of its practitioners to critique class-, gender- and race-based assumptions \nabout education as well as the enthusiasm with which some university adult \neducators have responded to the New Right agendas for education. From this \nperspective, there seems no reason why university continuing education should \nclaim the right to survive if it has failed to serve the educational aspirations of \nthose who have been excluded from what the university should offer.  \n \nWhilst continuing education departments in the historical liberal tradition \n(whether elitist or egalitarian) are unlikely to survive, it is important to rescue \nand nurture the principles of radical adult education which have been articulated \nwithin the academy (Freire 1972; Crowther et al 2005; The Edinburgh Papers \n2008; Martin 2003, 2008): a belief in the equality of human beings, a \ncommitment to social, cultural and political understanding as the desirable \noutcome of educational effort and a determination to direct resources to achieve \nthese ends. These principles run counter to the taken-for-granted assumptions \nthat the value of education can be reduced to its value as a commodity, that \naccess to education is not an issue for equality or democracy and that support for \nadult education other than for personal consumption or skills training is \nfrivolous, lacking in purpose or unrealistic. Government derision of \u2018hobby \nclasses\u2019, holiday Spanish and \u2018flower arranging\u2019 has been an ideological ploy to \nset up crude divisions between adult educators. It is important to expose these \nrhetorical distinctions as unfounded in order to reassert the potential for all forms \nof education to enlighten, transform, liberate, democratise \u2013 as well as to upskill. \n \nRadical hope also entails practical work and building alliances between \nuniversity-based adult educators and academics and progressive forces within \nand beyond the wider education field. This involves formulating strategies for \nengaging with communities of interest and location. Whilst there remains in both \ncountries a tendency amongst adult educators as \u2018practical people\u2019 (Thompson \ned. 1980) to elevate activity over theory, in New Zealand, effective work has \nbeen done through university continuing education\u2019s involvement in informal \nand formal regional adult and community education networks and through \noffering time, research expertise, training and support to the ACE sector. The \ncapacity exists to build further on current alliances which are growing in defence \nof adult education\u2019s potential contribution to the creation of a civil and just \nsociety. And, because there is a clear and continuing need to collect and \ndisseminate evidence of the value of adult education, committed academics are \nwell-placed to enter into collaborative research relationships with adult and \ncommunity education providers.  \n \nHowever powerless they may at times consider themselves to be, academics \ncontinue to occupy a unique and privileged position (Crowther et al 2005; \nWallace 2008): they have the advantage of a historically and research-informed \noverview; they have a platform of authority from which to act as \u2018critic and \nconscience\u2019 of society using the knowledge they generate to \u2018tell unwelcome \ntruths\u2019 (Kemmis 2006) about educational inequalities. Through \u2018critical praxis: \ninformed, committed action\u2019 (Carr and Kemmis 1986: 190) academics with a \nliberatory view of education can voice the \u2018unfashionable\u2019 and oppositional \n(Crowther et al 2005: 4; Martin 2008) and reassert the principles and pedagogy \nof education as a process, not merely a product. In return, university continuing \neducation can learn from community-based adult education how best to bridge \nthe gap between university and community, building pathways to and through \nuniversity for those who would normally see it as not being open to them \n \nConclusions \nUniversity continuing education in England and Aotearoa New Zealand has had \nto grapple with the complex, intertwined and sometimes contradictory changes \nwhich are happening in higher education \u2013 at global, national and institutional \nlevels. These changes have radically reshaped traditional notions of adult \neducation and there have been many casualties \u2013 particularly in English \nuniversities. Whilst in New Zealand, there have been mitigating contextual \nfactors, it is clear that university continuing education endeavours struggle to \nsurvive when government\u2019s vision of education becomes narrow and \ninstrumentalist and when universities begin to feel the pressure of the market. It \ncannot claim the right to exist just because it has done so historically; indeed, it \nlooks ominously likely that the structures of university continuing education may \nwither away. However, there is yet space to resist and to build radical hope \nthrough praxis, bringing adult education: \n\u2026.under considered critical control and enlivening it with a commitment \nto educational and social values. (Carr and Kemmis 1986: 190) \n \nUniversity-based adult educators and academics committed to social justice in \nEngland, New Zealand, and doubtless elsewhere, still have an important role: \nthey are ideally placed to expose neoliberalism\u2019s role in perpetuating and \nincreasing inequality and to work with adult educators and learners to loosen its \nhegemonic grip.  \n \nReferences  \nBarnett, R.

Today, the Treaty is an important document which underpins \nthe bicultural status of Aotearoa New Zealand and relationships between M\u0101ori and Pakeha (those of European \nsettler heritage). \n  \nii The author is indebted to Liz Tully and Robert Tobias for information and constructive feedback provided in \nthe course of writing this article and to Jenny Barclay, Susan Geertshuis, Brian Findsen and Claire Matthewson \nfor additional background information on recent developments in university continuing education in Aotearoa \nNew Zealand. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"}
