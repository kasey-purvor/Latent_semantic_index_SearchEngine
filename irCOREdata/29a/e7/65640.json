No data were available for Africa.\nResults: A multivariate stepwise linear regression model was used. Main outcome measure was age\nstandardised male mortality rates for 51 countries for the year 1995. Age standardised female homicide\nrates and GDP per capita ranking were the explanatory variables in the model. Results were also adjusted\nfor the effects of general rates of homicide. Age standardised female homicide rates and ranking of GDP\nwere strongly correlated with age standardised male mortality rates (Pearson\u2019s r=0.699 and Spearman\u2019s\n0.744 respectively) and both correlations achieved significance (p,0.005). Both factors were\nsubsequently included in the stepwise regression model. Female homicide rates explained 48.8% of the\nvariance in male mortality, and GDP a further 13.6% showing that the higher the rate of female homicide,\nand hence the greater the indicator of patriarchy, the higher is the rate of mortality among men.\nConclusion: These data suggest that oppression and exploitation harm the oppressors as well as those they\noppress, and that men\u2019s higher mortality is a preventable social condition, which could be tackled through\nglobal social policy measures.\nP\natriarchy, which has been described as \u2018\u2018a relationship of\ndominance and subordinance\u2026. sturdier than any form\nof segregation, and more rigorous than class stratifica-\ntion, more uniform, certainly more enduring\u2019\u20191 and more\nsimply as \u2018\u2018the systematic domination of women by men and\ndomination of men by other men\u2019\u2019,2 is a key analytical\nconcept in feminist social research. The interaction between\npatriarchy and women\u2019s health has been well reported.3\u20136\nHowever, the relation between patriarchy (although this term\nis seldom used explicitly) and male health has only recently\nbegun to receive the same level of attention as part of an\nupsurge of interest in masculinity, gendered behaviour, and\nhealth.7\u201312 In developed countries, men have a higher\nmortality rate than women at all ages13 14 and on average\nthey die nearly seven years earlier than women.15 Male\nmortality rates are higher across a number of different causes\nof mortality, such as coronary heart disease, lung cancer,\nsuicide, liver cirrhosis, and sexually transmitted diseases.16\nIncreasingly, these differences are being attributed to\nvariation in the behaviour of men and women.7 9 This in\nturn has led to the suggestion that patriarchy itself, through\nthe sex roles and patterns of behaviour to which it gives rise,\nmay be bad for men\u2019s health and lead to their higher\nmortality.15\u201317\nExisting studies on patriarchy and male health have\ntended to have a specific country focus (usually the\nUSA),15 16 18 and there has been no attempt at any cross\nnational exploration of the relation between patriarchy and\nmale mortality rates.\nIn the broader comparative literature certain countries are\nconsidered relatively less (for example, the Scandinavian\ncountries) or more (for example, the UK and the USA)\nstructured by sex than others.19\u201324 The relative level of\npatriarchy could thus be compared between countries using\nexposure measures, such as female participation in gainful\nemployment, the proportion of women in decision making\npositions, or the sex division of household labour,25 or\noutcome measures, such as violence against women or the\nfemale homicide rate.26 Evidence suggests overwhelmingly\nthat the perpetrators of sexual and domestic violence are men\nand the victims are women (and also children).26 27 The high\nproportion of female homicides carried out by men makes\nthis a valid indicator of patriarchy, at both individual and\ninstitutional levels, and data are available for a wide range of\ncountries. Therefore we have studied cross national variation\nin the relation between levels of patriarchy and male health\nby comparing female homicide rates with male mortality\nwithin countries. Specifically we were interested in testing\nthe hypothesis that high levels of patriarchy in a society are\nassociated with increased mortality among men.\nMETHODS\nData on age standardised all cause male mortality rates and\nage standardised female homicide rates were obtained from\nthe 1996 World Health Statistics Annual28 for 51 countries\nthroughout the world (see appendix) for the year 1995 (or\nwhere this was not available, for 1994). The annual provides\na detailed description of the validity and reliability of these\ndata stating that publication is limited to those countries that\nreport cause of death information in an appropriate format\nand in which death registration coverage can be estimated as\nreasonably good.\nCountries from four continents were represented in the\ndata\u2014America (North and South), Europe, Australasia, and\nAsia. No data were available for African countries. Gross\ndomestic product (GDP) per capita ranking for 1994\n(countries ranked as high, medium, or low GDP per capita)\nwas obtained from the Human Development Report 199729 to\nadjust for the independent effect of the level of socio-\neconomic development between countries. The countries\noffered a wide range in terms of economic development,\nGDP per capita, ranging from 1126 dollars (Tajikistan) to\n29 010 dollars (USA). Age standardised male homicide rates\n873\nwww.jech.com\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nwere also included in the model to adjust for the effects of\ngeneral rates of homicide.\nHomicide data were not normally distributed and were\ntherefore logged. Age standardised female homicide rates and\nGDP per capita ranking were then correlated with age\nstandardised male mortality rates. A multivariate stepwise\nlinear regression model was used to distinguish the inde-\npendent effect of female homicide on male mortality.\nRESULTS\nIn all countries female life expectancy exceeded that for\nmales. The distribution of two of the variables differed\nsignificantly from normal (Kolmogorov Smirnov statistic for\nnormality, age standardised female homicide rate, p=0.007;\nage standardised male homicide rate, p=0.001). Therefore\nthese variables were transformed using the natural log. Each\nvariable was then correlated with age standardised male\nmortality rates.\nAge standardised female homicide rates and age standar-\ndised male homicide rates were found to be strongly\ncorrelated with age standardised male mortality rates\n(Pearson\u2019s r=0.699 and 0.625 respectively) and both\ncorrelations were highly significant (p(0.0005). GDP rank-\ning was also strongly correlated with age standardised male\nmortality rates (Spearman\u2019s r=0.744, p(0.0005). All factors\nwere then included in a stepwise regression model to assess\nthe effect of each factor on the outcome variable (age\nstandardised male mortality rates). The model is shown in\ntables 1 and 2. The regression equation for the model is:\nmale mortality rate = 503.281 + 0.955 6 ln(female\nhomicide rate) + 0.5086 (GDP ranking) 2 0.4896 ln(male\nhomicide rate)\nOf the three factors in the model, female homicide rates\nhad the greater influence. Female homicide rates alone,\nexplain 48.8% of the variance in male mortality. When GDP is\nadded to the model, a further 13.6% of the variance is\nexplained and when male homicide is added a further 3.5% is\nexplained (table 1). This shows that the higher the rate of\nfemale homicide, and hence the greater the level of\npatriarchy, the higher is the rate of mortality among men.\nDISCUSSION\nWe have shown a substantial and significant association\nbetween nations\u2019 levels of patriarchy and men\u2019s higher\nmortality. Our data thus suggest that oppression and\nexploitation harm the oppressors as well as those they\noppress. The same practices that represent men\u2019s capacity to\noppress women and promote their interest in doing so are\nalso systematically harming men.30 Support for this assertion\ncomes from disparate sources. In the USA, men\u2019s higher\nmortality correlates strongly with a number of patriarchy\nindicators.18 In the less patriarchal setting of Israeli kibbut-\nzim, associations have been found between more sex\negalitarian social systems and reduced life expectancy\ndifferentials between the sexes\u2014these reduced differentials\nresulting from increases in male life expectancy.31 Similar\nfindings have been shown at the level of morbidity and\nwellbeing.32 The importance of these findings lies in the\nimplication that higher male mortality is a preventable social\nTable 1 Model summary showing proportion of variance in the outcome variable\nexplained by the predictors after adjusting for covariants in the model\nModel r r2 SE of the estimate\n1* 0.699 0.488 195.84754\n2\u0001 0.790 0.624 169.63524\n3` 0.812 0.659 163.33279\n*Predictors: constant, female homicide (ln). \u0001Predictors: constant, female homicide (ln), ranking based on GDP.\n`Predictors: constant, female homicide (ln), ranking based on GDP, male homicide (ln).\nTable 2 Relation between age standardised female homicide rates and age standardised male mortality rates adjusted for\nmale homicide and GDP ranking\nVariable\nUnadjusted b\ncoefficient Significance\n95% CI\nAdjusted b\ncoefficient t Significance\n95% CI\nLower Upper Lower Upper\nConstant 738.6 ,0.005 673.4 805.8 503.543 7.41 ,0.005 366.833 640.253\nFemale homicide rate\n(ln)\n202.329 ,0.005 139.7 264.1 275.354 4.638 ,0.005 155.918 394.791\nGDP ranking 215.784 4.837 ,0.005 126.041 305.527\nMale homicide rate (ln) 2101.918 22.185 0.037 2195.739 28.097\nDependent variable: male all cause mortality.\nWhat is already known\nMale mortality rates are higher across a number of different\ncauses of mortality and these differences have been\nattributed to behavioural differences between men and\nwomen. This has led to the suggestion that patriarchy itself\nmay be bad for men\u2019s health and lead to their higher\nmortality. However, there has been no cross national\nexploration of the relation between different countries\u2019 levels\nof patriarchy and male mortality rates.\nWhat this study adds\nWe have shown a substantial and significant association\nbetween countries\u2019 levels of patriarchy and men\u2019s higher\nmortality. Our data thus suggest that oppression and\nexploitation harm the oppressors as well as those they\noppress. The importance of these findings lies in the\nimplication that men\u2019s higher mortality is a preventable\nsocial condition, which can potentially be tackled through\nglobal social policy measures.\n874 Stanistreet, Bambra, Scott-Samuel\nwww.jech.com\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \ncondition, which can potentially be tackled through global\nsocial policy measures.\nIn a broader social context, it has often been asserted in\nhuman rights and philosophical discourse that oppression\nalso harms the oppressor, through the alienation that results\nfrom internalising the \u2018\u2018privileges\u2019\u2019 of oppression. It can\nreadily be envisaged that this will have health relevant\npsychosocial effects.\nThe factor used as an indicator of patriarchy, female\nhomicide, is not optimal and other factors could have been\nused such as political participation, earnings, or reproductive\nrights.18 However, our selection of this factor was in part\ndetermined by the availability and quality of cross national\ndata on other indicators. In terms of availability, interna-\ntional sources often only provide total rather than sex specific\ndata. In terms of quality, while data are available on some\nother factors, such as the percentage of women in politics or\nthe female to male wage ratio, the quality of much of these\ndata is questionable.25 For example, the women in politics\ndata exhibit high year on year variability, and the female to\nmale wage ratio data are based only on estimates.25 However,\nit is important to acknowledge that the study is limited by\nusing only one factor as an indicator of patriarchy.\nSimilarly, it must be noted that patriarchy is by no means\nan easily definable, uncontested, or easily measurable\nconcept. Different articulations of patriarchy exist within\nthe feminist literature. For example, some commentators,\nsuch as Brownmiller,33 focus on male power and control over\nwomen\u2019s sexuality; others, such as Firestone,34 highlight the\ncontrol and power that men have over women\u2019s reproductive\ncapacity, and more materialist feminists, such as Delphy35 or\nWilliams,36 argue that the family is a patriarchal mode of\nproduction in which women and men represent opposing\nclasses. Similarly, there are debates about where patriarchal\noppression is sited\u2014at the family or individual level (private\npatriarchy) or at the societal level (public patriarchy).19 24 37\nWe have attempted to encapsulate both sites of oppression\nwithin our indicator. However, as it is difficult to define\npatriarchy, it is equally difficult to adequately measure all\naspects of it. Furthermore, patriarchy is a contested concept\nand it has been criticised on the basis that it assumes that\noppression on the grounds of sex is experienced equally by all\nwomen (and men). Consequently, it is claimed that\npatriarchy is a somewhat limited concept as it does not take\ninto account the role of other diverse forms of oppression,\nsuch as class or race, or indeed reflect the diversity of\nexperienced oppression within sexes (for example, gendered\nmen and gendered women). This has led to some commen-\ntators, such as Connell, articulating more multidimensional\ntheories of sex and oppression. Our population level research\nis unable to engage with this debate, as individual level data\nare required for a more multidimensional analysis.38 39\nFurther research to identify other appropriate indicators of\npatriarchy and to explore further the association between\npatriarchy and poorer health among men is required. Such\nresearch should take into account the impact of level of\neconomic development. In addition, a study using data from\nAfrican nations would permit a more complete comparison.\nFinally, research is needed at the individual level in addition\nto the population level. Work is also required to develop\ninterventions aimed at preventing the almost globally\nendemic patriarchal gender roles resulting from parenting\nand early socialisation.40 41 This is an enormous, but in\nprinciple achievable task: the rewards will more than justify\nthe efforts.\nAuthors\u2019 affiliations\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nD Stanistreet, A Scott-Samuel, Division of Public Health, University of\nLiverpool, UK\nC Bambra, Centre of Health and Public Policy, Wolfson Institute,\nUniversity of Durham, UK\nFunding: none.\nConflicts of interest: none.\nREFERENCES\n1 Millet K.
