This behaviour in NAC films is believed to be \nattributed to the modification of the ,local electronic properties of graphitic nano- \ncrystal when subjected to high stress. Carbon nanotubes on the other hand are \ngraphitic tubes with high aspect ratio and interesting electronic properties. Single \nwalled nanotubes can be metal or semiconducting depending on its chirality, where \nmultiwall nanotubes (MWNT) 'are generally metallic. Reports have shown that by \napplying pressure on nanotubes its electronic properties can be modified where its \nband structure varies with stress. \nIn this work, the NAC films and MWNT composite thin films were subject to \nexternal stress by mechanical bending. Compressive stress was applied to the samples \nusing a three-point bending technique (Figure 1). The samples were bent using an \noptical fibre placed in the middle of the sample and two glass slides were used to clip \nthe sample at both ends to create a curvature. Optical fibres ranging from 50 pm to \n1000 pm were used to allow different compressive stresses to be applied on the \nsamples. Field emission properties were measured using the probe technique. The \nanode is placed directly above the region with the curvature where the stress is \nexpected to be maximum. \nThree a-C films with low ( 1  GPa), medium (6.5 GPa) and high intrinsic stress \n(11.7 GPa) was used to represent films. For the MWNT composite films, undoped \nMWNTs with 8% wt. concentration were mixed with polystyrene (PS) and hot- \npressed to form cathodes. The emission threshold fields of a MWNT-PS sample \nexperiencing different applied stress loadings varied from 2.3 to 0.7 Vlpm before \nrising back to 3.2 VIpm when the applied stress to the film was removed (Figure 2).  \nThis result is consistent with the results observed from NAC films where the applied \nstress modified the field emission properties. This study is further compared to the \nfield emission results from a-C films with different intrinsic stress. Figure 3 shows the \nfield emission threshold fields of a-C films with different intrinsic stress. The bending \nof the low stress film shows a very interesting sequence of results, as shown in figure \n3(a). Upon the application of external stress, &I, initially at 37 Vlpm falls to 24 VIpm, \nas the amount of stress is increased due the change in the curvature. This reduction of \n&h we believe is due to the increase of internal stress by having an external \nB . .  . \n* \nEngineering Depanment, University of Cambridge.

As the curvature is further increased, the stress \nbecomes too high to be sustained, and the threshold field increases. Hence, l%, \nincreases to 44 Vlpm as a mrtvimum stress is exceeded. This can be attributed to the \nhigh intrinsic stress within the films, not being exceeded by the external pressure on \nthe film or the phenomenon responsible for the electron densityldecrease in threshold \nexceeding the \u201cstress threshold value\u201d.
