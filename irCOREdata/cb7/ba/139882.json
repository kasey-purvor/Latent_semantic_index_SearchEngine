Steenbakker, R.G Wellman and J.R Nicholls\nSchool of Industrial and Manufacturing Science\nCranfield University, Bedford,\nMK 43 OAL, UK.\nAbstract\nThermal barrier coatings using 8 wt% yttria partially stabilised zirconia as the top coat have been\nused in gas turbine engines for a number of decades and is an accepted technology. However, in\nrecent years there has been a drive towards increasing the efficiency of engines which has\nresulted in the drive towards higher turbine entry temperatures, thus pushing the current materials\nto their limits, therefore the need to develop coatings with lower thermal conductivities and\ngreater temperature capabilities. One of the proposed solutions is the addition of rare earth oxides\nto lower the thermal conductivity of the coatings. Gadolinia additions have been shown to\nsignificantly reduce the thermal conductivity of EB PVD TBCs, but there are concerns on how\nsuch additions affect the impact resistance of the coatings.\nThe aim of this paper is to further the understanding on the effects of dopants on the erosion\nresistance of EB PVD TBCs by studying the effects of 2 mol% Gd2O3 additions on the room and\nhigh temperature erosion resistance of as received and aged EB PVD TBCs. Previously it has\nbeen reported that gadolinia additions increased the erosion rate of EB PVD TBCs, this is indeed\nthe case for room temperature erosion, however under high temperature (825\u00b0C) erosion\nconditions this is not the case and the doped TBCs have a slightly lower erosion rate than the\nstandard YSZ EB PVD TBCs. This has been attributed to a change in the erosion mechanisms\nthat operate at the different temperatures. This change in mechanism was not expected under the\nimpact conditions used and has been attributed to a change in the column diameter, and how this\ninfluences the dynamics of particle impaction.\nIt is proposed that the important factor in determining the predominant erosion mechanism is the\nratio between the contact diameter of the impacting particle and the diameter of the columns of\nthe EB PVD coating. This ratio can also be related to the observed reduction in the measured\nnano hardness of EB PVD TBCs as the load increases and the number of columns interacting\nwith the indenter head increases.\nKeywords: Erosion, EB PVD TBC, Doped.\n1 Introduction\nNowadays it is commonly admitted that EB PVD TBCs offer high strain compliance and good\nerosion resistance compared to APS TBCs therefore EB PVD TBCs mechanical properties are\nvery attractive knowing that erosion is seen as a secondary cause of failure as small ingested\nparticles can cause significant damage to the coating. Unfortunately EB PVD technique also leads\nto a coating with a higher thermal conductivity hence the challenge was to lower the thermal\nconductivity of EB-PVD TBCs to match that of plasma sprayed system to provide a coating with\nexcellent thermal properties.\nThe mechanisms and techniques to further decrease the thermal conductivity of the EB-PVD\nTBCs by adding rare earth oxides are well documented 1-3. It has been shown that rare earth oxide\nadditions can significantly lower the thermal conductivity of EB-PVD TBCs and thermal\nconductivity close to that of APS TBCs has been achieved by doping the coating with 2 mol% of\ngadolinia 3.\nA fair amount of work has been published on the erosion of EB-PVD TBCs in the as-received\ncondition under various conditions of temperature, velocity, impact angles and with different\ntypes of erodent 4-10. The erosion mechanisms of EB-PVD TBCs have also been well described by\nNicholls, Wellman and Chen et al 4;6;8, the effect of heat treatments on the properties of TBCs has\nalso been studied 11 and work has been done on the erosion of aged samples at room temperature.\nHowever the authors are not aware of any work published on the erosion of aged EB-PVD TBCs\nat high temperature.\nThe purpose of this work was to determine if rare earth additions modified the erosion resistance\nand mechanisms of the EB-PVD TBCs. If the erosion resistance of doped EB-PVD TBCs were\nunchanged it would provide a coating with excellent mechanical and thermal properties and\ndoped TBCs would be a material of choice for high pressure turbine blade applications.\n2 Testing\nFor the experiments two types of coatings were used, a standard ZrO2 \u2013 8 wt% Y2O3 and a\nstandard YSZ doped with 2 mol% of Gd2O3. The standard YSZ coatings were deposited on\nalumina substrate and the doped coatings on zirconia and C263 substrate all by EB PVD. In order\nto determine the effect of ageing on the erosion rate, two different sets of ageing times and\ntemperature were used. Of the four coatings deposited on the alumina substrate one was tested in\nthe as-received condition, two were heat treated during 100 hours at 1100\u00b0C and the last one was\nheat treated 24 hours at 1500\u00b0C. Theses samples were used as reference samples. Among the\ndoped samples, two were used in the as-received condition, two were heat treated 100 hours at\n1100\u00b0C and the last two were heat treated 24 hours at 1500\u00b0C. The different types of specimens\nare listed in the Table 1.\nThe erosion tests were carried out using alumina particles with a size range between 90-125 \u03bcm\nfor an impact angle of 90\u00b0C and a feed rate of 0.5 g\/min. The samples were tested at room\ntemperature and at 825\u00b0C. The erosion conditions are listed in Table 2. The erosion tests were\ncarried out using the high pressure gas gun erosion rig at Cranfield University, a description of\nwhich can be found in a previous publication by Nicholls et al 5.\n3 Results and Discussion\n3.1 Erosion at room temperature\nThe results are presented graphically in Figure 1. These results show that the erosion rate at\nnormal impact of standard YSZ increases by circa 50% when the sample is aged 100 hours at\n1100\u00b0C, this is consistent with the results published by Wellman et al 11 who tested the same type\nof EB-PVD TBCs under the similar conditions. This trend is observed for the doped TBCs with a\ndramatic increase of the erosion rate for the sample aged 24 hours at 1500\u00b0C. After the first cycle\nof the erosion run this sample was completely cracked and after the third cycle (0.38g) the\ncoating was penetrated. This increase in erosion rate with ageing is linked with sintering: cracks\ncan propagate to neighbouring columns as they are sintered together resulting in a greater\nmaterial loss per impact 11.\nIt was also noted that the doped TBCs on the zirconia and C263 substrate have about the same the\nerosion rates. Moreover these results show that the erosion rate is greater for the doped TBCs for\nthe samples tested in the as-received condition as well as the aged samples. The erosion rate\nincreases by between 70-80% when the TBC is doped with Gd2O3. The reasons for the decrease\nof erosion resistance due to dopant additions remain unknown.\nGadolinia addition is believed to increase the sintering resistance of the coating 12. If the top\nviews of the doped and standard are compared it can be noticed that for both TBCs when aged\n100 hours at 1100\u00b0C the top of the columns remain pyramidal and it is difficult to differentiate\nbetween the aged and the as-received sample. However at higher ageing temperature for the\nstandard TBC there is evidence of columns sintering together, the boundaries between individual\ncolumns is less defined and the pyramidal top is smoothed (Figure 2) . On the contrary the doped\nTBC shows no evidence of sintering and the top of the columns are still pyramidal hence it is\ndifficult to distinguish the sample that has been aged from the as-received sample by looking at\nthe top view micrographs. Sintering is evident in the cross-section micrograph of the doped TBC\naged 24 hours at 1500\u00b0C however it appears that sintering is less pronounced than in the standard\nTBC. It has been proposed that dopant additions introduce immobile defect clusters reducing the\nmovement of atoms hence increasing the sintering resistance of the coating 12. On the one hand\nimprovement in sintering resistance due to gadolinia addition means that the columns of doped\nTBCs should be less sintered and therefore it should be more difficult for the cracks to propagate\nto the neighbouring columns and this would result in a lower material loss hence a better erosion\nresistance. On the other hand, due to sintering, the featherlike structure of the columns is\nsmoothed out and it has been shown that these dendrites act as flaws at the column edge hence\npromoting crack initiation 4. It is known that sintering tends to smooth these notches and therefore\nit probably reduces crack initiation from dendrites. Consequently it could be easier to initiate\ncracks in a doped TBC that has been aged hence lowering the erosion resistance compared to\naged standard TBCs.\nThe Raman spectroscopy clearly shows that the tetragonal phase is stabilised by the gadolinia\naddition (Figure 3). The tetragonal phase has a better bend strength, thermal shock resistance and\nfracture toughness than the monoclinic phase 13 therefore gadolinia addition should provide a\ncoating with better mechanical properties hence better erosion resistance after ageing compared to\nstandard TBCs. However the erosion results show that the erosion is higher for the as-received\nand aged samples therefore phase transformation may not be the major reason for the increase in\nerosion rates of aged samples or the addition of dopants has a more significant effect on the\ncoating and its erosion resistance\nGadolinia was added to the coating to reduce the thermal conductivity of EB-PVD TBCs. Other\nwork on dopant additions reported extensive cluster dopant segregation 14. The dopant\ncomposition heterogeneity facilitates the formation of defect clusters and nano-phases which can\nreach sizes between 5 and 100 nm. Moreover, due to its high atomic mass and different lattice\nparameter compared to YSZ, gadolinia causes local lattice mismatch in the coating. This results\nin the formation of micro-cavities at the cluster\/matrix interface due to lattice mismatch12.\nHowever these clusters surrounded by cavities can act as stress concentrators and help to initiate\ncracks in the coating. Furthermore the lattice mismatch also introduces stresses in the coating\nwhich can facilitate the formation of cracks around these clusters and \u201cweaken\u201d the coating. It has\nbeen proposed that when a particle impacts a column, a region of plastic deformation surrounded\nby a region of elastic deformation is formed and on unloading, due to the elastic\/plastic mismatch\nstress field, tensile stresses are generated in the column 4. These stresses will be greater at the\nedge of the cavities and the critical stress value to initiate and propagate cracks could be reached\nmore easily as it is represented in Figure 4. Stresses due to lattice mismatch and the formation of\ndefect clusters that scatter phonons to reduce the thermal conductivity could be the reason why\ndoped TBCs have a lower erosion resistance at room temperature.\nA new erosion mechanism has been observed for the doped sample tested in the as received\ncondition at room temperature and is illustrated in Figure 5. As it can be seen from the\nmicrographs, lateral cracks run parallel to the surface of the coating at different depths.\nFurthermore cracks do not stop at the column boundaries and propagate across several columns.\nIt looks like \u201ca stage erosion\u201d, on impacts a crack at a depth between 10-20 \u03bcm is formed and\npropagates across multiple columns parallel to the surface. Then the layer is removed exposing\nthe underneath layer to the flow of particles and so on. It is worth noticing that cracks can also be\nobserved much deeper in the coating. This particular erosion mechanism was observed for the\ndoped TBCs on both the zirconia and the C263 substrate in the as-received condition. There was\nno evidence of this type of cracking in the aged samples. Erosion in the aged samples occurs in\nthe same manner as the standard TBC.\nFirst it was believed that this was due to segregation of gadolinia and that cracks propagated in\nlayers rich in gadolinia. However the EDS elemental mapping revealed no segregation detectable\nby this method, gadolinia appeared to be uniformly distributed in the coating and there was no\nregion rich in gadolinia at the edge of the cracks.\nIt is proposed that during initial impact elastic compression waves are induced beneath the\nimpacting particle. The columns are around 3-5 microns in diameter and the alumina particles\nsize is 100 microns therefore a single impact could affect about 20 columns. The compression\nwaves propagate down the columns and at the interface with the TGO they reflect in diffuse\ntensile waves and propagate back toward the top of the coating. The tensile stresses generated\ncould cause cracks to form from the dendrites at the edge of the columns and extend across the\ncolumns. Once the crack is formed it will grow due to the stresses generated by further impacts\nand this will lead to the spallation of a complete layer of columns. Moreover further impacts will\ninduce compressive waves which could close the crack hence producing another impact which\ncould generate stress waves causing cracks much deeper in the coating.\nIf the column diameters of the standard and doped TBCs are compared, the doped TBC has much\nfiner columns in the range of 3-5 microns against 6-8 microns for the standard one. From the\nmicrograph Figure 6 it can be seen that the doped TBC has a \u201cneedle like\u201d microstructure and the\ncolumns seem much more packed altogether. This is due to the fact that gadolinia has a lower\nmelting point compared to zirconia, indeed for gadolinia Tm=2420\u00b0C and for zirconia Tm=2700\u00b0C\ntherefore the global melting point of the doped coating is lower than the melting point of standard\nYSZ. As the standard and doped coatings were deposited at the same temperature the mobility of\nthe atoms will be greater during the deposition of the doped coating therefore there will be more\nnucleation on the substrate and this will result in a coating with tightly packed columns with\nsmaller diameters. Consequently the \u201csaw teeth\u201d which give this particular \u201cfeatherlike\u201d structure\nto the columns must be closely entangled and this could explain why the cracks can propagate to\nthe neighbouring columns.\n3.2 Erosion at high temperature\nThe results are presented graphically in Figure 7. The erosion rate of the standard YSZ aged 24\nhours at 1500\u00b0C was surprisingly low with an erosion rate of 7.4 g\/kg and was not expected. The\ntrend of the erosion results at room temperature indicates that the erosion rate of the standard\nYSZ aged 24 hours at 1500\u00b0C should be higher than the erosion rate of the standard YSZ aged\n100 hours at 1100\u00b0C, however, when tested at 825\u00b0C it was found to be four times lower. It can\nbe seen from Figure 8 that the sintering is very different for this sample and it is very difficult to\ndistinguish individual columns. It is believed this loss in columnar microstructure is caused by\nCMAS effects due to impurities in the alumina substrate. Consequently the erosion rate of this\nsample is closer to that of bulk zirconia than an aged EB-PVD TBC. This is significantly lower\nthan that observed by Wellman et al in similar test. However, the substrate used was zirconia and\nnot alumina and consequently CMAS did not affect the sintering of the TBC.\nThe erosion rate of the doped TBCs increases with the ageing temperature exactly like for the test\nat room temperature, however when comparing the doped and the standard TBCs aged 100 hours\nat 1100\u00b0C the erosion resistance of the doped TBC is better than the standard TBC. At room\ntemperature the opposite behaviour is observed with the standard TBC a lot more erosion\nresistant than the doped one. If the results at room temperature and high temperature are\ncompared for the doped TBCs it can be noted that the erosion rates are lower when tested at high\ntemperature. Knowing that the velocity of the impacting particles is higher for the test at high\ntemperature the samples tested at high temperature should have a higher erosion rate compared to\nthose tested at room temperature. Moreover the erosion rate of the doped TBC in the as-received\nconditions at high temperature (10.5 g\/kg) is also lower than the erosion rate of the standard\nsample tested at room temperature (13.1 g\/kg). These \u201canomalies\u201d have been attributed to\nchanges in the erosion mechanisms.\nIn their work on Foreign Object Damage (FOD), Wellman et al have clearly identified that plastic\ndeformation can occur during large particle impact in the form of buckling at high temperature 8.\nSEM analysis of sectioned samples (Figure 9) revealed that material loss in the doped TBCs\neroded at high temperature was via a FOD type II mechanism rather than an erosion (lateral\ncracking) mechanism. The micrograph Figure 9 shows that at high temperature, due to impacts,\nthe columns of the doped coating buckled almost without cracking. Consequently doped TBC has\nthe ability to plastically deform at high temperature hence absorbing the kinetic energy of the\nimpacting particles. When a particle impacts the coating it decelerates progressively as the\ncolumns buckle therefore the damage caused by the impact is reduced, moreover buckling\noccurred without significant cracking hence reducing the erosion rate of the doped TBC. Further\nimpacts will increase the degree of buckling in the columns and cracks will start to form as shown\nin Figure 10 and it will be followed by material loss. Kink bands were also found in the doped\nTBCs eroded at high temperature (Figure 11). When the plastic zone penetrates deeply in the\ncoating the stresses generated can be very damaging and plastic deformation can be accompanied\nwith kink bands that initiates around the perimeter of the plastic zone and large-scale\ndelamination can be formed 6. Buckling occurred in the sample tested in the as received condition\nand in the one aged 100 hours at 1100\u00b0C however there was no evidence of buckling in the\nsample aged 24 hours at 1500\u00b0C. As the erosion rate for this sample is also reduced compared to\nthe test at room temperature it is believed that there was a certain amount of buckling but it was\nnot evident on the micrographs that were examined.\nPlastic deformation in the form of densification was also evident on the doped samples tested at\nhigh temperature (Figure 12). Successive impacts generate hydrostatic compression in the\ncolumns removing porosity by \u201cdynamic hot pressing\u201d hence forming a densified layer 6. Further\nimpacts induce elastic stress waves building tensile stresses at the interface between the dense\nlayer and the underlying columnar microstructure that can initiate cracks. These cracks can\npropagate under subsequent impacts causing partial detachment of the dense layer and material\nremoval as it is shown in Figure 12. Plastic deformation in the form of densification or buckling\nabsorbs the energy of the impacting particles therefore significantly reduces cracking and the\ndamage in the coating and increases the erosion resistance of the doped coating at high\ntemperature.\nThe switch from \u201cMode I: erosion\u201d for standard TBCs to \u201cMode III: FOD\u201d for the doped TBCs\ntested at high temperature is believed to be linked to the finer microstructure observed for doped\nTBCs and the higher degree of plasticity under the high temperature test conditions. The size of\nimpacting particles being the same, the ratio between the contact foot print of the impact (D) and\nthe column diameter (d) is higher for doped TBCs consequently the load created by impacting\nparticles is shared between a higher number of columns therefore the applied load is\naccommodated more efficiently than if it was contained within a smaller number of columns.\nAnalyses of a number of samples impacted under various test conditions have shown that for\nstandard YSZ, a D\/d ratio less than one results in \u201cMode I: erosion\u201d while a D\/d ratio of about 2\nto 10 results in compaction damage and a ratio greater than 10 results in FOD with the associated\nkink bands, densification and in some cases buckling of the columns.\nThe importance of contact area relative to column diameter has also been noted in the micro\nhardness testing of EB PVD TBCs, where the measured hardness of the columns decreases as the\nload increases and the indenter interacts with more and more columns. This has been described\nas the difference in measuring the hardness of the individual column, when the indent is\ncontained within the column, to measuring the hardness of the coating \u2018as a whole\u2019, when the\nindenter interacts with more than 15 columns. Between these two points is a transition region\nwhere neither the coating as a whole nor the individual column hardness is being measured\n(Figure 13).\n4 Future work\nBy decreasing the deposition temperature a doped coating with coarser columns should be\nproduced consequently this would enable one to determine if the plastic deformation observed for\nthe doped TBCs is due to its fine microstructure or other changes in the microstructure due to\ngadolinia additions.\n5 Conclusion\nThe erosion rates found in this research suggested that gadolinia addition has the detrimental\neffect of lowering the erosion resistance of the coating at room temperature. Dopant addition is\nassociated with the formation of defect clusters and clusters dopant segregation. These clusters,\ncombined with the stresses generated by the lattice mismatch could be responsible for the\nreduction in erosion resistance of doped EB-PVD TBCs observed at room temperature.\nIt has also been shown that doped coatings can plastically deform at high temperature in the form\nof densification and buckling without significant cracking. Such behaviour is advantageous as it\nreduces the damage caused by the impact and therefore reduces the erosion rates at high\ntemperature. It was found that the doped TBC tested in the as-received condition at high\ntemperature has a higher erosion resistance than the standard sample tested at room temperature\nhighlighting the significant effect of plastic deformation in the reduction of erosion rates. The\nfiner microstructure observed for doped TBCs is believed to be responsible for this change in\nerosion mechanism.\nA new erosion mechanism has been observed for the doped TBCs tested at room temperature in\nthe as-received condition. Large cracks propagate across a significant number of columns parallel\nto the surface at various depths in the coating. It is believed that these cracks are caused by elastic\nstress waves and can propagate to a significant number of columns due to the fact that columns in\nthe doped coating are narrow and tightly packed.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors wish to thank the EC for their financial support under the Hipercoat project and Dr J.\nNychka (UCSB) for the raman spectroscopy.\nReference List\n1.
