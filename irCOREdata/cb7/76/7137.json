As course designer and one of a number\nof tutors, I embarked on the research with the aim of improving my understanding of\nthe experience of learning within the networked environment, and the effectiveness\nof my educational practice in this context. It is beyond the scope of this paper to\npresent the full detail of the case study, as provided in part elsewhere (Levy, 2006a,\nb), or of the personal learning that arose out of the research. Instead, the purpose here\nis to highlight the overarching theoretical outcome of the project: a broad conceptual\n*Department of Information Studies, Regent Court, 211 Portobello Street, University of Sheffield,\nSheffield S1 4DP, UK.

The term \u2018process support\u2019 is used specifically in this paper to refer to\nsupport for the development of understandings and capabilities related to \u2018learning to\nlearn\u2019\u2014as distinct from support for domain (or subject) learning.\nResearch by Jones et al. (2000, p. 19) indicates that networked learning practitioners\noften claim not to \u2018fully understand the relationship between their educational designs\nand their outcomes\u2019. Action research offers a means of exploring and interpreting this\nrelationship, and of developing conceptual models and frameworks that aim to\nencapsulate new understandings and guide on-going practice. The educational know-\nledge produced through this process is personal, practical and essentially context-\nspecific (Grundy, 1982). Theory produced through action research might be thought\nof as theory-in-process, the dynamic, \u2018living\u2019 theory of professional practice (McNiff\net al., 1996). Nevertheless, the \u2018living\u2019 theory of one practitioner may be of relevance\nto others working in similar contexts with similar values and purposes.\nThe paper continues by outlining the pedagogical approach adopted for the\ncourse and the action research methodology. It then identifies key dimensions of\nfour broad, interconnected developmental processes\u2014orientation, communica-\ntion, socialisation and organisation\u2014that were associated with \u2018learning to learn\u2019 in\nthe course\u2019s networked environment, and offers a flavour of participants\u2019 experi-\nences in relation to these processes. A number of key evaluation issues that arose\nare highlighted. Finally, the paper presents the broad conceptual framework for the\ndesign and facilitation of process support in networked learning that was derived\nfrom this research. The framework proposes a strong, explicit focus on support for\nprocess as well as domain learning, and progression from tighter to looser design\nand facilitation structures for process-focused (as well as domain-focused) learning\ntasks.\nPedagogical approach\nThe term \u2018networked learning\u2019 is used in this paper expressly to indicate a specific set\nof pedagogical understandings and commitments within the broader context of\ne-learning. The design and facilitation of the case-study course was informed by\nconstructivist educational principles and ideas associated with collaborative profes-\nsional learning in a \u2018virtual community\u2019, as well as by humanistic perspectives on\nadult and experiential learning. Constructivist perspectives on learning exist across a\nwide spectrum, embracing more individual-cognitivist and more social-constructivist\nand social-constructionist epistemologies. On this spectrum, networked learning\nperspectives incline towards the latter two. Defined broadly as \u2018learning in which\ninformation and communications technology (ICT) is used to promote connections:\nbetween one learner and other learners, between learners and tutors, between a\nlearning community and its learning resources\u2019 (Jones & Steeples, 2002, p. 2),\nnetworked learning approaches are underpinned strongly by a social conception of\nlearning that emphasises the importance of dialogical and cooperative engagement\nwithin a knowledge-building community of practice.\nPedagogical framework for process support 227\nAt the same time, the networked learning perspective is accommodative, arguably,\nof ideas and practical frameworks\u2014such as Kolb\u2019s (1984) framework for experiential\nlearning\u2014that are more closely aligned with cognitivist than with social perspectives\non learning. Kolb defines experiential learning as \u2018the process whereby knowledge is\ncreated through the transformation of experience\u2019 (1984, p. 38). His learning cycle\nmodels experiential learning as a process involving: engagement in a learning activity\nor experience; critical reflection; analysis and conceptualisation in the light of other\nperspectives; assessment of implications as regards application to a new situation; and\nengagement in a further cycle of learning. The model offers a design framework for\naddressing the process dimensions of personal and group development in networked\nand other learning contexts, through activities that aim to develop learners\u2019 self-\nawareness and capacity to continuously learn to learn (Weil & McGill, 1989).\nA key challenge in the networked learning context is the question of how to\nempower learners to engage actively and productively with the range of pedagogical,\nsocial, informational and technical resources that are at their disposal, as well as with\na learning approach that may well be unfamiliar to them. Using the facilities, tools\nand resources of the online environment may not be experienced as straightforward.\nAt the same time, the developmental implications for learners of constructivist\npedagogies are well known. Progression from disorientation to reorientation through\npraxis\u2014that is, through critically reflective action that generates personal, practical\nknowledge about learning\u2014is recognised as part of the process of becoming a\n\u2018constructivist\u2019 learner (for example, Brookfield, 1986). Drawing on constructivist\nprinciples (for example, Grabinger & Dunlap, 1995), the four key assumptions that\nunderpinned the design of the case-study course were as follows: \n\u25cf Learning is not limited to the construction of domain knowledge, but also includes\na situated process dimension related to the development of meta-cognitive and\nother practical capabilities associated with learning itself, which contribute to\nlearners\u2019 effectiveness in using the resources within their learning environments\nand in responding flexibly and positively to challenges encountered.\n\u25cf Learning activities can be conceived as having two, inter-related dimensions: a\ndomain dimension related to subject focus, and a process dimension related to the\nlearner\u2019s engagement with the learning approach, environment, resources and tools.\n\u25cf Process understanding and skills are constructed through situated engagement\nwithin specific learning contexts, but appropriate capabilities cannot be assumed\nto develop automatically; therefore, pedagogical practice that aims to support\nprocess as well as domain learning needs to take into consideration the probable\nsupport needs of learners and adopt an integrated, contextualised and explicit\napproach to process support in the design of tasks, and use of resources and tools.\n\u25cf Novice networked learners in particular might well need support to further develop\nthose personal understandings, strategies and skills that will be of relevance to this\napproach to learning and to the tools and resources at their disposal.\nWith these considerations in mind there was a relatively strong, explicit focus on\nprocess in the pedagogical design for the case study course. Kolb\u2019s (1984) experiential\n228 P. Levy\nlearning cycle was used as a broad framework for the design of reflexive, process-\noriented learning tasks. The course entailed between six to eight hours of distance\nlearning activity for participants (information professionals from UK higher educa-\ntion) over 17 weeks. Its subject-focus was the professional practice of \u2018networked\nlearner support\u2019; that is, the educational role of the information specialist in the\nnetworked environment. The first, two-week unit aimed to introduce participants (all\nof whom were newcomers to networked learning) to the course\u2019s purposes,\nenvironment, tools and approach. Then a number of process tasks were embedded\ninto the course, designed to encourage participants to engage reflexively with their\nown experience as networked learners, and to focus explicitly on further developing\nunderstandings and capabilities of relevance to self-managed, networked learning in\na practitioner community framework. For example, one exercise was designed to\nencourage structured reflection on personal assumptions about, and approaches to,\nlearning, and another to explore collaborative learning practices in the course\u2019s online\nenvironment. The concluding task of each of the course\u2019s seven thematic units was a\n\u2018closing round\u2019 in which participants were invited to reflect on and discuss online their\nlearning experiences during the unit.\nFurther key activities within course units (which were of either two or three weeks\nduration) arose out of a combination of individual, small-group and plenary group\ntasks. These included: information gathering and exchange; tutor-led discussion in a\nplenary forum; small-group work including case-study analysis and peer review of\nindividual projects; technology experimentation and evaluation; reading; work-based\nproject development; and learning portfolios and journals. The bespoke technical\nplatform was a relatively simple, web-based environment offering an asynchronous\nbulletin board, synchronous web-based \u2018chat\u2019, access to a text-based multi-user\ndomain, object-oriented (MOO) with a suite of \u2018virtual seminar rooms\u2019, and access\nto text-based information resources and learning materials. A graphical activity-map\nillustrating the sequence of tasks and the relationships between them, and providing\nguidance on each one, was a feature of the sequentially introduced \u2018home page\u2019 for\neach unit.\nMethodology\nIn a critique of methodological approaches that are commonly used in networked\nlearning research, Hodgson and Watland (2004, p. 103) suggest that the field will\nbenefit from the adoption of \u2018methodological perspectives and methods that are\ncommensurate with the values and ideas of networked learning\u2019. This project sought\nto apply social constructivist values and methods to the action research approach.\nGuba and Lincoln\u2019s model of constructivist inquiry and evaluation (Guba & Lincoln,\n1989; Lincoln, 2001) proposes a qualitative, \u2018hermeneutic\u2013dialectic\u2019 approach that is\nconcerned with (re)constructing and understanding (socially constructed) experi-\nences and conceptions through cycles of dialogical exchange. Their approach was\ndrawn upon to inform the research design, which blended action research with\nconstructivist evaluation (see Levy, 2003).\nPedagogical framework for process support 229\nIn practical terms, the project involved moving through a cycle of research activities\nwithin four main phases: planning the action (the course) and the research; taking the\naction and monitoring and documenting it; (re)constructing and evaluating it as a\ncase; and further developing \u2018living\u2019 theory of practice for networked learning. A\ncombination of online and face-to-face data collection methods were used, including\nparticipant observation and online transcript analysis, online dialogues, a post-course\nparticipant feedback questionnaire (responded to by all 33 participants), face-to-face\nresearch conversations (with 28 participants), peer debriefing with other tutors,\nreflective dialogue with a \u2018critical friend\u2019 and a personal research journal. All of these\nsources were drawn upon for the holistic case (re)construction of \u2018what happened\u2019 on\nthe course and for subsequent evaluative exploration of the question \u2018how should this\nbe interpreted?\u2019 in relation to educational objectives, assumptions and strategies.\nThe case narrative and associated evaluation were \u2018member-checked\u2019 as part of the\nresearch validation process. There was a very high degree of consensus within the group\nof 15 responding participants that the over-arching conceptual model of experiences\nof participation (see later) was credible and that the case and evaluation provide a fair\nand meaningful representation of participant perspectives. While it would have been\ndesirable to achieve a higher level of response to member-checking, the group that did\nrespond represented a good cross-section of experiences of the course.\nLearning to learn in a networked environment\nThe research led to the identification of four over-arching, interconnected devel-\nopmental processes associated with learning to learn in the course\u2019s networked\nenvironment. These were broadly defined as follows: \n\u25cf Orientation\u2014becoming aware of, and positioned in relation to, key features of the\nlearning environment, resources and approach.\n\u25cf Communication\u2014using computer-mediated communication (CMC) as a means of\nself-expression and dialogue within the learning environment.\n\u25cf Socialisation\u2014developing interpersonal connections, relationships and community\nfeeling within the learning environment.\n\u25cf Organisation\u2014planning, structuring, managing and directing personal and collec-\ntive engagement with the networked learning environment, resources and tasks.\nPositive experiences in these areas contributed to productive engagement with learning\ntasks and the learning community, while negative experiences placed constraints on\nthis. Developmental progression in all four areas was facilitated by experiential involve-\nment in the learning activity over time combined with opportunities for reflexive\nengagement with process issues that arose. However, there was considerable variation\nin the speed and ease of individual engagement within these areas.\nIllustrating these themes, Figure 1 presents a simplified conceptual model of expe-\nriences of learning to learn on the course as participants moved through a range of\nstructured learning activities (both domain-orientated and process-orientated). The\ndiagram draws attention to the core processes of orientation, communication,\n230 P. Levy\nsocialisation and organisation as central within the context of this particular learning\nenvironment and the implementation of the design for learning. It shows these\nprocesses as parallel and interconnected, and indicates a relationship of mutual\ninfluence between experiences in these four areas. For example, experiences of social-\nisation and communication, as might be expected, were very much interconnected.\nThe developmental dimension of these processes, in terms of perceptions of\nimproved personal awareness, relationships and practices in networked learning over\ntime, is signalled in Figure 1 with the upwards arrow, as is the impact of variations in\nthe \u2018entry conditions\u2019 for individual learners in addition to the impact of design and\nfacilitation factors within the learning environment itself.\nFigure 1. \u2018Core\u2019 developmental processes in networked learningThe following sections highlight the various dimensions of each \u2018core\u2019 process and\nsome key issues relating to them as they emerged in this environment.\nOrientation\n(a) Orientation within the learning space\u2014involving becoming aware of, and posi-\ntioned within, the structure of the course website and the virtual spaces created\nby its CMC tools. Most participants needed relatively little time early on to gain\na clear overview of the learning environment and resources, and to navigate the\nFigure 1. \u2018Core\u2019 developmental processes in networked learning\nPedagogical framework for process support 231\nspace easily. The design and usability of the website and CMC tools, the presen-\ntation of learning unit overviews and other text and resources, and the quality of\ntechnical support were all highly rated in evaluation feedback. However, it took a\nfew participants somewhat longer than others to become fully aware of, and\nconfident about, the structure of the site and the resources and facilities at their\ndisposal. Contrary to expectation, not all participants used their time during the\nintroductory unit to explore the learning space fully when they entered the\nlearning environment, with the result that there were resources that remained\nundiscovered by them until considerably later on.\n(b) Orientation within the information environment\u2014involving becoming aware of, and\npositioned within, the digital information environment within and beyond the\ncourse environment. On the one hand, the extensive scope of the course\u2019s\nResource Base, with its signposts to a rich, wider landscape of digital resources\non the web, was a source of excitement to many participants. On the other hand,\nit could contribute to a sense of information overload and anxiety. The border-\nlessness of the environment, combined with the seductions of hypertext, could be\nexperienced as disorienting and in engaging with information resources partici-\npants could become distracted from engagement with other tasks. Re-orientation\nwithin the information landscape occurred over time, as participants explored\nwhat was \u2018out there\u2019 and came to judgements about the quality and relevance of\nwhat they encountered in relation to their learning purposes.\n(c) Orientation to the pedagogical approach\u2014involving becoming aware of, and\nengaged with, the nature and practical implications of the pedagogical approach.\nFor some participants, especially those with prior practical experience of self-\ndirected learning, it proved relatively unproblematic to engage rapidly with,\nassimilate and act upon information and guidance about the pedagogical\napproach. For others, this proved to be a much less straightforward and more\nextended process. It was common in the early weeks to fail to \u2018take in\u2019 early infor-\nmation, guidance and discussion about the approach and tasks. Getting used to\nthe technical features of the environment, intensive activity in some introductory\nplenary forums and the amount of information available via the Resource Base\nproved distractions in this respect, and induction tasks relating to exploring the\nlearning approach were experienced as too loosely structured to engage full\ncommitment. More fundamentally, participants often were not in a position\nimmediately to assimilate information about a learning approach that, with its\nemphasis on self-directedness, collaboration, flexibility of focus in relation to\npersonal learning goals, and critical reflection on process, was both unfamiliar\nand unexpected. However, they were often reluctant to voice concerns relating to\nthe approach in public forums or via email to tutors.\nCommunication\n(a) Communicating asynchronously\u2014principally involving using the course\u2019s bulletin\nboard system. For some participants, this was experienced as relatively\n232 P. Levy\nstraightforward from the outset. As the course progressed, those who became\nactive communicators also became increasingly acclimatised to the dynamics of\nconferencing and more comfortable with the medium as a means of self-\nexpression and dialogue. However, many faced a significant learning curve in\nrelation to using asynchronous conferencing, which was experienced as a\nwholly new form of communication, to support their own and others\u2019 learning.\nIn addition, many experienced a high threshold to contributing to seminar-\nstyle discussion in the plenary discussion forum; group size and a commonly\nperceived need to contribute highly crafted postings were two inhibiting factors\nhere. The threshold was lower within smaller (learning set) groups of four to\nsix people, in which participants often felt freer to adopt a more informal,\npersonal style that was experienced as more in keeping with the dynamics of\none-to-one or small group talk in a face-to-face environment. In the light of\nexperience, and shared reflection on experience with tutors and peers, partici-\npants\u2019 practices and perspectives relating to conferencing commonly changed.\nTypically, they became less concerned about careful crafting of postings and\nmore aware of the value of informal and conversational, as well as structured\nand reflective, styles of exchange.\n(b) Communicating synchronously\u2014principally involving using the MOO. This was\nintroduced into the learning environment some weeks into the course. There was\nwide variation in individual responses to the different CMC media, some partic-\nipants much preferring the more reflective nature of asynchronous interaction over\nsynchronous. Others became enthusiastic users of the MOO, experiencing the\nreal-time interaction as much more akin to face-to-face talk and appreciating the\nbenefits of spontaneity in learning dialogues. The chance to articulate and clarify\nideas rapidly, and to gain near-instant feedback, was welcomed, and the medium\nwas found to be valuable for sparking argument and interactive building of ideas.\nSocialisation\n(a) Developing connections and relationships\u2014forming one-to-one interpersonal\nconnections and relationships with tutors and peers. As the course progressed,\nsome participants developed a strong sense of interpersonal connection and rela-\ntionship with others, as mediated through both asynchronous and synchronous\ninteraction. This played an important role in their engagement with the course.\nDeveloping interpersonal connection was strongly associated with the experience\nof sensing the \u2018social presence\u2019 of others. Engagement in real-time interaction via\nthe MOO was often found to be more conducive to this than asynchronous inter-\naction. In general, the strongest and most satisfying interpersonal connections\ndeveloped within the context of small group interactions in which social as well\nas task-related interaction became an integral aspect of building dialogical learn-\ning relationships.\n(b) Developing community\u2014experiencing group or community affiliation within the\nlearning environment. Although not a universal experience, most participants\nPedagogical framework for process support 233\nexperienced a growing sense of involvement in community, or \u2018groupness\u2019 as the\ncourse progressed. The sense of community affiliation was fostered in particular\nthrough opportunities to identify shared professional identities, experiences and\nconcerns, and also tended to be associated with individuals\u2019 position in the\nexchange network. Those who were most active in exchanging advice, ideas,\nfeedback and support in the context of collaborative learning tasks and dialogical\nreflection developed a particularly strong sense of belonging, which itself\nmotivated further reciprocal exchange. Unsurprisingly, a sense of affiliation was\nstrongest in relation to the group of people with whom participants experienced\nthe most intensive exchange\u2014for most, their smaller learning set rather than the\nwider group. The use of real-time communication was perceived to be a key\nfactor in cementing group as well as individual relationships, and fostering a\ncollective sense of group belonging and commitment, in a number of sets.\nOrganisation\n(a) Managing communication\u2014involving developing practical access and response\nroutines for asynchronous conferencing, and organisational strategies for using\nsynchronous \u2018chat\u2019 effectively. This was one of five areas in which participants\noften referred to the need to develop personal and collective organisational\n\u2018structures\u2019 for their learning. Some were especially successful in developing\nregular patterns of frequent access, with a positive impact on the strength of their\nengagement (whether as active communicators or not) with course discussion.\nSome also adopted disciplined response routines that helped them to sustain\npersonal motivation to participate and to keep up with the rapid pace and high\nvolume of traffic in some plenary discussions. Others failed to establish effective,\npractical routines for accessing and contributing to forums, with a negative\nimpact on their sense of involvement. Some sets established regular (generally\nweekly) meetings in the MOO, which was found to provide a welcome change of\npace and helped to stimulate and sustain group interaction. Following an initial\nMOO training session, some sets were particularly successful in combining the\nuse of synchronous and asynchronous modes of communication, which were\nexperienced as complementary, in an integrated way.\n(b) Managing information\u2014involving developing strategies for engaging with the flow\nof information generated within the learning environment, including selective\nreading and storing of especially relevant information in personal portfolios. The\nneed to develop strategies to manage the flow of information was experienced in\nparticular in relation to engaging with the volume of conferencing traffic. Infor-\nmation overload here was a common experience towards the start of the course\nespecially, at which time it was common to start out by attempting to read every\nposting to the public forums. As threads and themes multiplied many participants\nbecame more selective in what they chose to follow.\n(c) Managing time\u2014involving allocating time to the networked learning in the context\nof working and domestic lives. This was a key challenge for many participants.\n234 P. Levy\nCompounding their own problems with time, the pace of the course was generally\nexperienced as too rapid, learning unit time-scales as too short, and collaborative\nonline activities unexpectedly time-consuming, leading to frustrations and some\nconstraints on assimilation of learning.\n(d) Managing flexibility\u2014involving imposing personal structure and direction in\nrelation to flexible learning tasks. Some participants responded positively to this\nfrom the start, but most felt the need for more externally imposed structure in this\nrespect to begin with, developing a clearer sense of personal direction and tailoring\ntheir focus to their developing interests as time went on. \u2018Managing flexibility\u2019 also\ninvolved managing the flexible mode of study, in that participants needed to\nestablish a personal study pattern that would enable them to accommodate appro-\npriate asynchronous and synchronous communication routines as well as periods\nof individual planning and activity. With competing demands on their time, it was\ncommon to struggle with the practice, if not the principle, of flexibility as a mode\nof study; real-time meetings in the MOO, while entailing some sacrifice of\npersonal flexibility, were found to be useful in terms of imposing structure on\npersonal work patterns.\n(e) Managing collaboration\u2014involving coordinating and facilitating collaborative\nactivity online, in small, distributed learning groups. Some sets included partici-\npants who from the outset were particularly strongly motivated to contribute to\ncoordinating collective activity. However, proactive interventions by tutors in the\nearly stages of the course were critical in establishing the momentum of collabo-\nrative work in an unfamiliar environment. As time went on, coordination typically\nbecame increasingly shared among group participants. The reflective group\nreview task some way into the course was effective in further enhancing group\norganisation and processes, helping in the development of better collective under-\nstanding and agreement in sets about how to manage collaboration in the online\nenvironment in ways that suited their particular context.\nEvaluation\nThe preceding section has highlighted some key aspects of experiences of acclimati-\nsation (or non-acclimatisation) to an unfamiliar learning environment and\napproach\u2014a process that entailed a level of frustration and anxiety as well as excite-\nment for many participants as they engaged, individually and collectively, with new\nconceptions of, and strategies for, professional learning. There are a number of\npoints of similarity between the picture of networked learners\u2019 experiences as repre-\nsented in this case and that afforded by other research (for example, Eastmond,\n1995; McConnell, 2000). However, rather than revealing stage-by-stage learner\nprogression through a generic sequence of experiences\/practices (Salmon, 2000),\nthe picture that emerged here was of diverse experiences of engagement with inter-\nconnected, in-parallel developmental processes. This non-linear perspective on\nlearners\u2019 experiences suggests the need for a non-linear, holistic approach to process\nsupport.\nPedagogical framework for process support 235\nFrom an evaluative perspective, the case study raised the question of the effective-\nness of process support strategies in relation to the various dimensions of the four\n\u2018core\u2019 developmental areas, both at the stage of induction to the learning environ-\nment and beyond. Evaluation therefore focused specifically on exploring this ques-\ntion. There was strong consensus among participants that a more extended online\ninduction period at the start of the course would have been welcome. The research\nsuggested a conceptual framework for this, in terms of preliminary scaffolding for the\nvarious dimensions of the four key process areas. For example, strategies identified\nfor more extended induction included: more tightly structured initial exploration of\nthe implications of features of the learning design and approach, combined with\nincreased personal contact between individual learners and tutors (orientation);\nexploitation of multiple communications media and small group formats to encour-\nage early engagement with CMC (communication); group-building activity for\nlearning sets (socialisation); and practical guidance on personal communication\ndiscipline and issues related to \u2018media choice\u2019, time management and group coordi-\nnation (organisation).\nThe following paragraphs highlight some of the especially salient points that\nemerged from the process-support evaluation in relation to four key dimensions of\ndesigning and facilitating networked learning: task design, socio-technical design,\ninformation design and tutoring design\/practice. Task design refers to the design of\nindividual, small group and plenary learning tasks, including aspects such as peer\nfeedback and support. Socio-technical design refers to the design of the technical\nplatform for the social environment. Information design refers to the design of the\ninformation environment and specific information\/learning resources. Tutoring\ndesign refers to the strategy for tutoring (e.g. as regards facilitation of collaborative\nactivity) and its implementation in practice, and includes technical support where this\nis provided in person. These categories emerged from a preliminary cycle of\nevaluation data analysis and, consequently, were then adopted to structure the\nevaluation of each process area.\nTask design\nThe question of structure was perhaps the key issue that arose in relation to the design\nof both process-focused and domain-focused learning tasks. Research by Jones et al.\n(2000) has suggested that the matter of how to introduce structure into designs for\nlearning, and how much structure to introduce, are often key issues for networked\nlearning practitioners. These authors contrast \u2018tight\u2019 design structures\u2014reflected in\nstrategies such as detailed task instructions, pre-identified outputs and strict dead-\nlines\u2014with \u2018loose\u2019 structures that offer greater scope for participants to determine the\nprocesses, direction and outcomes of their inquiries. The more successful design\napproaches examined in their research tended to exhibit \u2018tight initial structures [\u2026]\nbut then allowed relative freedom in a loosely structured environment\u2019 (Jones et al.,\n2000, p. 26). This action research project pointed to similar conclusions. Tight\nstructure in relation to individual and collaborative tasks, particularly at the start of\n236 P. Levy\nthe course, had a positive impact in terms of engagement with core processes; loose\nstructure had a negative impact.\nThe relatively strong focus on process on the course, in the form of opportunities\nfor critical reflection and dialogue on process issues, was found particularly valuable\nfor the development of \u2018learning to learn\u2019 capabilities. Evaluation confirmed the need\nfor, and value of, providing explicit, structured on-going support for process\ndevelopment beyond an initial \u2018induction\u2019 period, responsively encouraging a reflexive\napproach to process issues as they emerged and using the experiential learning cycle\nas a design framework for process activity. The potential to apply the experiential\nlearning cycle more systematically and in a more tightly structured way to the design\nof process tasks, and the likely benefits of such an approach especially in the earlier\nstages, emerged as a particularly significant outcome of evaluation of the course.\nHowever, there is greater difficulty, in the online as compared with the face-to-face\nenvironment, of directing and pacing learners\u2019 engagement with a designed sequence\nof learning tasks. This suggests that e-learning systems that facilitate structured\nprogression through a series of activities with associated outputs, such as the Learning\nActivity Management System, may prove to offer a useful platform for online\napproaches that seek to apply the experiential learning cycle as a design framework.\nSocio-technical design\nThe main issue that arose in relation to the technical design of the social environ-\nment was associated with the use of the MOO. As highlighted in the case synopsis,\nsynchronous communication using this medium was shown to have a strong positive\nimpact for many participants for key aspects of communication, socialisation and\norganisation. Its use in combination with other media supported individual\ndifferences in communication styles and preferences, and it enabled exploitation of\nthe value of spontaneity in communication. Like other research, this project\nsuggested that \u2018synchronous communication [\u2026] contributes much more to\ncommunity-building than asynchronous communication\u2019 (Haythornthwaite et al.,\n2000, p. 15) and it also highlighted the value of the MOO in relation to managing\ntime, flexibility and collaboration. These considerations suggested that earlier and\nmore embedded use of this (or similar) technology would have had significant\nprocess benefits in all of these areas. In the light of the communication and sociali-\nsation benefits of the MOO it also seems likely that early use of synchronous CMC\nwould have improved the conditions for dialogue on orientation issues, by providing\nan additional platform for discussion between peers and with tutors.\nInformation design\nIssues relating to the provision of information resources arose in relation to supporting\naspects of orientation, organisation and socialisation in particular. As illustrated, the\nextensive Resource Base contributed to information overload early in the course. An\nalternative approach would have been to expose participants to fewer pre-identified\nPedagogical framework for process support 237\nresources initially, as the first stage in a step-by-step process towards orientation\nwithin the broad \u2018information landscape\u2019 of relevance to their interests. The need for\nadditional guidance materials on aspects of organisation for networked learning\u2014\nsuch as how to manage asynchronous communication routines, and how to divide\ntime between online and offline activity\u2014was also flagged up through the evaluation\nprocess. Information design issues relating to supporting socialisation included the\nidentification of enhanced strategies for promoting on-going \u2018people-networking\u2019\nthrough the presentation of dynamic (as opposed to fixed) and more easily searchable\npersonal learner profiles.\nTutoring design\/practice\nA range of issues arose from the evaluation of tutoring design and practice in relation\nto each of the core processes, including for my own practice as a tutor. That there was\na need for more intensive personal contact between tutors and learners at the earlier\nstages of the programme in particular, in order to better support orientation within\nthe learning space and to the approach, has already been highlighted. Another general\nissue was associated with the role of tutors in supporting socialisation, in terms of\nwillingness to share personal experience and to become actively involved in (and\nmodel) exchange of valued community \u2018resources\u2019 such as advice and assistance in\ninformal as well as more formal interactions.\n\u2018Living\u2019 theory\nThe research highlighted themes related to developmental, \u2018learning to learn\u2019, issues\nin networked learning. It enabled refinement of a conceptual framework for process\nsupport in networked learning that is informed by constructivist and experiential\nlearning principles, and validated by empirical inquiry. Figure 2 represents the over-\narching \u2018living\u2019 theory that was developed through this project in terms of a non-linear\nframework for the design and facilitation (and, by extension, evaluation) of process\nsupport for networked learning.\nFigure 2. Non-linear framework for process support in networked learningAs illustrated, the framework identifies four broad foci for integrated process\nsupport\u2014orientation, communication, socialisation and organisation\u2014within two\nbroad design\/action phases: induction and on-going development. The implication is\nthat these foci and phases need to be taken into consideration when applying four\nunderpinning elements of networked learning design and facilitation\u2014identified as\ntask design, socio-technical design, information design and tutoring design\/practice.\nThe framework also suggests a strategy of progression from tighter to looser struc-\ntures in the design and facilitation of both process and domain learning as learners\nbecome increasingly acclimatised to their environment and the learning approach.\nThe relationship between the four key process dimensions of networked learning is\nconceived as in-parallel and interconnected, rather than sequential. This suggests the\npossibility of a holistic, integrated and flexible pedagogical approach that aims to be\nsensitive both to individual differences within the learning group in terms of\n238 P. Levy\n\u2018readiness\u2019 for different aspects of networked learning in a given environment, and to\nthe multi-dimensional character of the overall developmental process at any given\npoint in a networked learner\u2019s experience.\nIn incorporating a strong, explicit focus on process as well as domain activity within\nthe learning environment, the framework reflects a holistic view whereby subject and\nprocess domains in learning are conceived as inextricably connected. It also reflects\nan assumption that initial induction, while important, will not be sufficient to support\nthe developmental process, for newcomers to networked learning, of \u2018learning to\nlearn\u2019 through on-going, situated, collective action. Thus, the framework contextua-\nlises explicit \u2018learning about process\u2019 in relation to (increasingly complex) domain\nlearning. Based on this case study research, it suggests that a key part of pedagogical\nstrategy for networked learning will be the design of online tasks and feedback\ndesigned to support the construction of reflexive process knowledge about \u2018construc-\ntivist learning\u2019 as well as domain knowledge\u2014with the experiential learning cycle\nproviding a useful design framework in this respect. Alexander and Boud (2001, p. 3)\nhave noted that \u2018learners still learn from experience when online\u2019, and this case study\nFigure 2. Non-linear framework for process support in networked learning\nPedagogical framework for process support 239\nsuggested that the experiential learning design framework can transfer well from face-\nto-face to online learning environments.\nThe framework expresses pedagogical intent at a high level of abstraction and\ngenerality. Moreover, as a representation of personal, \u2018living\u2019 theory, it aspires neither\nto all-inclusive representation of process support issues in networked learning nor to\nuniversal applicability. Rather, it is offered simply as a working model that is\ngrounded in the specific concerns and circumstances of personal practice and\nunderstandings\u2014that is amenable to further testing, refinement and elaboration. A\nfurther outcome of this project was a personal checklist of reflection points and\nflexible \u2018rules of thumb\u2019 for implementing the framework in my continuing practice\u2014\nnot as a fixed blueprint, but as an aide-memoire of issues for consideration when differ-\nent initiatives are being planned.\nConclusion\nThe paper has shown how the move was made from an exploration of networked\nlearners\u2019 experience, and a critical evaluation of personal practice, to the refinement\nof a broad conceptual framework that encapsulates the understandings derived from\nthe action research and that can guide continuing practice and research\/evaluation.\nIn highlighting four \u2018core\u2019 process areas and the question of structure in networked\nlearning, the theoretical principles underpinning this framework (or \u2018living\u2019 theory)\nare assumed, rather than made explicit, in Figure 2. Over recent years, a number of\npedagogical frameworks for e-learning have been proposed from constructivist and\nrelated perspectives, as reviewed by Mayes and de Freitas (2004). The distinctive\nelement of this framework is in highlighting the interconnection between domain and\nprocess learning and in suggesting a non-linear approach to supporting learning to\nlearn in the networked environment, based on experiential learning design and\nprogression from tighter to looser structures for process-focused (as well as domain-\nfocused) learning activity.\nReferences\nAlexander, S. & Boud, D.
