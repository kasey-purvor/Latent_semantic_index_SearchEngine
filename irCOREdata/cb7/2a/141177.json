INTRODUCTION\nThere are many articles that focus on how to design, or redesign, a manufacturing system to deliver\ncompetitiveness in terms of cost, quality and delivery. Often the motives for such papers are pressures to\nrespond to competition in lower cost economies. However, a topic that is frequently overlooked is the role of\nthe production facility in helping to demonstrate the value built into products. Treating the factory as a\nshowroom is an obvious marketing opportunity. Some manufacturers will offer carefully orchestrated tours,\nwhile many others are amenable to visit requests. Distillery tours in Scotland, UK, to see the whisky\nproduction processes are a classic example of this. The question that then arises is how to do this\neffectively? The literature however gives little guidance on how best to showcase a production facility, more\ncrucially, there is nothing what-so-ever in terms of manufacturing system design considerations. Therefore,\nthis paper sets out to present a series of guidelines that practitioners can use to help manage the\nexperiences of visitors to their facilities.\nThe guidelines have themselves been generated through a series of six case studies of UK manufacturers.\nThe research has been carried out by a team of practitioners using a largely inductive methodology.\nAnalysis of these cases has then led to the generation of findings, which range from promoting heritage and\nemphasising a commitment to the environment, through to presenting exciting processes. This as been an\nexploratory study and, in presenting this paper, we are mindful that these guidelines are not complex neither\nhave their relative merits been evaluated. Yet, to a practitioner they provide a useful guide to showcasing\ntheir facility and, to the research community, a starting point for exploring the much greater challenge of\ncreating manufacturing system designs that are consistent with the brand identity sought by an organisation.\nThis is a topic we intend to explore in the future.\nIn terms of the structure of this paper, we first give a more in-depth background to the factory as a showroom\nand the related topic of branding. The research design and case studies are then described, and this leads\ninto the generation of the key findings. Finally, conclusions are drawn and our thoughts about future work\ngiven.\n22. BACKGROUND\n2.1 The factory as a salesroom\nSupporting the notion of using the factory as a salesroom, Tsai (2005) suggests the space in which the\nproduct is produced, marketed, delivered, and serviced should correspond to the customer\u2019s expectation of\nthe brand. This develops the idea of experiential marketing to include a tour of a manufacturing plant, where\nthe marketing experience is described by Pine & Gilmore (2004) as a \u201cphysical or virtual experience that's so\nengaging current and potential customers can't help but pay attention-and buy your product.\u201d This so-called\nbrand experience is the process of taking the values of the brand and extrapolating them into an\nenvironment where the consumer becomes immersed, surrounded by colors, shapes, sounds and\nsensations which embody what the brand is about. Mitchell & Mitchell (1999) see factory tours as a strategic\ntool that connects people with the creation of products through their curiosity with how things work and in\nturn create personal bonds with the products. Likewise, Brumberg & Axelrod (1995) quote one company\npresident as saying \u201cOne visit has more value than one hundred commercials\u201d.\nThe hurdle according to Valencia (2005) with creating such experiences is that there are few established\nprofessionals, publications, definitions, required skills, metrics or best practices. Whilst there are some\npapers that address manufacturing tours, there is little literature giving guidelines for principles and design of\nthese. Mitchell & Orwig (2002) state that consumer experience tourism has received little attention in the\n[marketing] literature. There are publications (e.g. Axelrod & Brumberg, 1995) that document the range and\naccessibility of plant tours but not the guiding design principles. Upton & Macadam (1997) are amongst the\nfew that do present an approach for designing a plant tour. This work can usefully inform the features of a\ntour as it takes the perspective of the visitor (student, business person, etc) but it does not relate the features\nof any particular aspects of the brand. Likewise, some very high level features of factory tours have been\ndocumented by Mitchell & Mitchell (1999) who consider such factors as:\n\uf0b7 Geographic location\n\uf0b7 Admissions (booking and fees)\n\uf0b7 Touring the facility through the use of guides\n\uf0b7 Nostalgia and re-connection with the past\n\uf0b7 Creating a multi-sensory experience, such as tastings in food\/drink sector\n\uf0b7 The role of branded merchandise through gifts and\/or a shop\n\uf0b7 Recognition of liability and security\nWhilst these characteristic are broad they lack the specific detail for others to use as guidelines for the\ncreation of tours that reinforce brand. Unfortunately, the link between experience, brand reinforcement and\nrevenue generation is difficult to measure, especially with the relatively low numbers that would be capable\nto visiting a production facility. In a retail environment Green (2003) suggests that the use of branding\nthroughout the outlet directly increases saleability of the product. However, for many companies, the primary\nmotivation is not immediate revenue generation but to reinforce brand image and in turn create and enhance\nbrand loyalty (Valencia, 2005).\n2.2 An overview of branding\nThe concept of \u2018branding\u2019 originated in the 19th Century with the introduction of packaged goods (Omar and\nWilliams, 2006). At this time companies began the \u201cmarking\u201d of their products to assist in grouping and\nsorting for onward distribution. The fallout was to provide product recognition within the market place, which\ndeveloped into what is commonly known as \u201cbrand recognition\u201d. A brand is a consumer\u2019s perception that a\nproduct or company is distinctive and offers more than the competition (Von Brachel, 1999). Simplistically, a\nbrand is a visual aid developed by companies to represent implicit value, ideas and even personality that will\nengage the consumer (Schmitt, 1999). Brand identity represents the firm\u2019s reality whilst brand image\nrepresents the consumer\u2019s perceptions therefore by strengthening the linkage between identity and image\nbrand loyalty can be created (Nandan, 2005).\nThe importance of brand identity cannot be underestimated. It can influence the ease of entering new\nmarkets, the price a company can charge, and the type of customer it can attract (Lancaster and\nMassingham, 1988). For these reasons it has become a major focus for marketing professionals in a bid to\ndifferentiate their products (Omar and Williams, 2006). Most work in this area focuses on advertising the\nvalue of the product or services to the potential consumer. However, it is not only through the product and\nservice itself that brand identity can be nurtured; the perceptions of the host organisation can also play an\nimportant role. For example, Dyson in the UK is known as a product innovator in the home cleaning market.\nAs brand loyalty increases, the concept of brand equity can be developed. Brand equity represents the\nadditional value bestowed on a product as a result of loyalty within the marketplace (Nandan, 2005). Its\n3strengths resistance against competitive product attacks, additional support in pricing and promotional wars,\nand an established customer base for the launch of new products.\nExperiences can support branding. In a world in which brands rule, products are no longer bundles of\nfunctional characteristics but are rather a means to provide and enhance customer experiences (Schmitt,\n1999). In essence, the consumer now identifies with a brand promise. The experience has gone on to be\nassociated with the promise, thus achieving the brand loyalty the manufacturer desires, and according to\nReichheld and Sasser (1990) is the \u201cultimate goal of marketing\u201d.\nIn the industrial sector it is perceived that brand identity is governed by internal marketing organisations, yet\nthere are also other functions which can contribute. The manufacturing operations department often\nrepresents a significant proportion of the workforce and indeed creates the product for the marketplace and\nso can contribute and support the delivery of brand identity to the customer. Veley (1998) suggests one of\nthe main approaches as being through a company\u2019s people. Their attitude towards the product and the way\nin which they carryout their job can emit a sense of pride which in turn increases the sense of brand identity\nfor the customer. Wheeler et al (2006) concur and go on to propose that if an employee attains a high level\nof job satisfaction he will be keen to share it with prospective customers. Gotsi and Wilson (2001) quote one\ninterviewee \u201cthe real proof of the pudding is when the visions, values and sense of purpose are translated\ninto the detailed day-to-day changes to people's behaviour and success criteria\u201d. Whilst this is related to the\ninternal behaviours it is relevant to how a company portrays itself to visitors. Ind (2001) takes the\nperspective of human resources and marketing functions within a business informing the company rather\nthan incorporation with operations and its design. From the human resources perspective, Gofton (2000)\nexamines the issue of brand performance measurement and staff facing the question \u201cAm I on brand\u201d.\n3. RESEARCH DESIGN\n3.1 Aim and Scope\nThe purpose of this research has been to establish a set of guidelines, for the manufacturing professional,\nwhich can be used to influence the way in which production facilities are showcased. On approaching this\nstudy, it became apparent that there is little previous work in this area, with no directly relevant existing\nmodels or frameworks on which to build. Therefore, our chosen approach has been to conduct an\nexploratory study, following a largely inductive approach, where we set out to gain insight and identify the\npopular approaches to showcasing a facility. The limitation of this approach is that no assessment can be\nmade about the relative or absolute effects. Nevertheless, this work will form a basis for such in-depth and\ncritical analysis in the future and, in the meantime, provide useful guidance for manufacturers.\nOn designing the study it was decided to focus on physical tours of facilities and specifically excluded virtual\ntours, e.g. BMW\u2019s South Carolina video based virtual plant tour (BMW, 2007). Whilst video tours can offer a\nvaluable means of presenting a facility, our particular interest in this work is in helping manufacturers deal\neffectively with physical visitors to their production facilities.\n3.2 Case Study Design\nA case study research methodology was chosen because it is helpful and insightful for investigating loosely\nformed ideas (Yin, 1994), as opposed to the traditional survey with a questionnaire which requires a\nthorough grasp of the intricacies of the topical area (Synodinos, 2003). The choice of case study companies\nwas carefully controlled. Our notion is that manufacturers with a stronger brand identity are likely to be\nsensitive to how their facilities are exhibited, and so more likely to demonstrate good practices. Therefore,\ncompanies were targeted with a relatively high ranking within the Brand Index League table published yearly\n(Brand Index, 2005). A number of companies were then approached and asked to host the study. From this,\nsix companies were selected to represent a number of different industrial sectors. The case studies chosen\ngave a mixture of commercially available tours and visits arranged specifically for the research. We have\nchosen not to disclose the actual company names, as this gives us greater freedom to discuss our results\nand findings.\nThe research team itself was also carefully chosen. This research was carried out in collaboration with\nRolls-Royce Aerospace and BOC Edwards. These companies combined to provide a group of 20 senior\nengineers, technologists and mangers to participate in the collection and analysis of data and compilation of\nfindings. Over a course of one week in March 2007, this group visited each company, typically spending one\nday within a plant, and interviewed a wide range of people from senior managers to operators to tour guides.\n3.3 Data Collection Protocol\nPrior to visiting each of the case study sites thought was given to the data that would need to be collected.\nIn the absence of sufficient previous work on this topic to form the basis of a structured questionnaire, the\nteam had to rely on creating a broad set of questions to guide semi-structured interviews. Although these\n4questions would not necessarily lead directly to an equivalent set of findings, they would ensure the team\nfirst explored the brand identity associated with each case company, and then seek to identify the practices\nwhich best showcased these. Some indication as to the type of questions to ask was gained from the more\ngeneral literature on branding. Exploration of the content involved suggests two very different approaches to\nthe composition of brand identity. Witkowski et al (2003) conclude that a tangible set of components make\nup brand identity whereas Nandan (2005) assumes a more ethereal feel containing behaviours and culture.\nThese categories detail different methods of getting the brand message across in terms of \u201cquality, heritage\nand contemporary imagery\u201d (Lannon, 1994). A hybrid of these two approaches provides the basis of our four\nkey research questions, namely:\n\uf0b7 What is the \u2018personality\u2019 that the host company aspires to associates with their brand?\n\uf0b7 What \u2018practices\u2019 within the manufacturing operation are presented to visitors and how do these relate to\nthe aspired brand personality?\n\uf0b7 What aspects of \u2018products\u2019 are presented to visitors and how do these relate to the aspired brand\npersonality?\n\uf0b7 How is the overall manufacturing facility \u2018presented\u2019 and how does this relate to the aspired brand\npersonality?\n4. OVERVIEW OF THE CASE STUDIES\n4.1 AutoComponent Ltd\nThis site was established in 1951 and produces high quality veneer fascias. The brand features highly in the\nbrand index and is a household name associated with quality, tradition and prestige. It is a relatively small\nsite but wholly owned by a large corporation that makes extensive use of this specialist facility to support the\ndifferentiation of their prestigious product. During the tour each group was led through the manufacturing\nstages, each stage of the process was described in detail to the groups. The tour followed a pre-determined\nroute through the factory, which was well orchestrated through floor markings outlining the gangways and\nwas conducted by experienced personnel. The factory was painted in the corporate colours, and all\npersonnel were wearing corporate work wear brandishing the company\u2019s logo.\n4.2 FineChina Ltd\nFineChina has been a manufacturer of fine china for over two centuries and is now part of a larger group\nwhich employs over 9500 people and has approximate annual sales of \u00a3500 million. The brand is within the\ntop 10 in its category in the brand index league and can be considered a prestige household name known for\ncraftsmanship and quality. The factory tour commences at a purpose built reception area. Here, various\nmedia forms are utilised to portray the company\u2019s proud heritage with emphasis on the craft skills employed.\nThe self guided tour then follows a pre-defined route through a production area of the factory where workers\ncan be watched carrying out specialist and intricate tasks. The tour concludes in a large and well furnished\nfactory shop.\n4.3 Excavators Ltd\nExcavators is a manufacturer of construction and agricultural equipment pioneered by its founder in the\n1940s. The brand is synonymous with its sector and has an image of quality and durability. Again, the tour\ncommenced at a large and well equipped reception area. Retired employees then gave a detailed and well\ninformed guided tour of much of the production facility. Here, brand image was re-emphasised continually\nand various media formats, and corporate colours were evident throughout the factory. In a similar vein, the\nphrase \u2018A great British manufacturer\u2019 appearing on media throughout the factory.\n4.4 Automotive Ltd\nAutomotive grew from an initial motorcycle sidecar firm in the 1920s. The visit to Automotive saw a mixture\nof tools used to promote the brand. This was initiated through entrance to a purpose built Visitors Centre\ncontaining examples of the product, merchandise shop and a media facility to explain the history of the firm.\nThere was however little evidence of brand identity within the factory, other than the vehicles themselves.\n4.5 Confectionery Ltd\nThis particular brand of confectionery started in 1824 with the opening of a shop in Birmingham selling tea,\ncoffee and the founders\u2019 homemade drinking chocolate or cocoa. The brand features extremely highly in the\nbrand index league and is synonymous with its sector with an image of taste, quality and perhaps fun.\nToday Confectionery has a visitor centre in Birmingham dedicated to the history of chocolate and this was\nthe focus for the research for this study. This centre educates the visitors through a series of differing\nmediums including videos, holographic stories and interactive settings.\n54.6 SpecialistAuto Ltd\nSpecialistAuto was founded in 1911 and has built its reputation on building classically styled cars,\nmanufactured by traditional methods, with the main body of the cars still built from wood. The brand is\nassociated with craftsmanship and adventure. An informal tour of the manufacturing facility was given by an\nexperienced employee. This was preceded by an introduction to the company and its history by the\ngrandson of the founder.\n6Topic Policy Possible practices\nArrival and reception Promote positive first impression of facility\nand brand by guiding the visitor smoothly to\nthe site and reception\n1.

FINDINGS AND ANALYSIS\nThis section presents the key guidelines that have emerged from the execution of the research design.\nThese have been presented in an order that reflects how a typical visitor is exposed to a manufacturer, and\nare summarised in table 1.\n5.1 Arrival and reception at the manufacturing facility\nUpton & Macadam (1997) suggest that most visitors don\u2019t begin thinking about a factory until they are in the\nplant\u2019s parking lot. While this may be the case, our study shows that most manufactures do consider the\nvisitors experiences well before their arrival. Confectionary, for example, provides signage that begins on\nthe motorway exit some miles from the facility itself. The visitor is then guided to take the optimum route to\nthe car park and into the reception area. Similarly, at Excavators, the flagship site is purposefully\nlandscaped to include a lake, corporate sculptures, and a clearly signposted parking and road network.\nHere, there was then adequate parking for cars and buses, clear sign posting to the reception area, where\nthe visitor is then welcomed and greeted with refreshments. Within reception at Excavator, FineChina and\nAutomotive, the visitor was then exposed to the company\u2019s heritage, products and awards. These\nexperiences all indicate the perceived importance of promoting a positive first impression of the facility by\nguiding the visitor smoothly to the site and reception.\n5.2 Health and safety upon arrival\nHealth and safety requirements necessitate that visitors are appropriately briefed prior to a site tour,\nhowever, some businesses also took this as an immediate opportunity to present their facilities. For\nexample, Automotive and Excavators provided each visitor with high visibility vests and safety glasses which\nall carried the company logo. Then, during the briefing, they conveyed both business and safety values to\nthe visitor. Similarly, FineChina and Confectionary both made extensive use of safety signage which also\ncarried the company brand. This branding was very subtle and unobtrusive, yet acted as a reminder of the\nhost. Overall this evidence suggests that while health and safety process are a legal necessity they are also\nan opportunity to demonstrate a positive image of the manufacturing facility early in a visit.\n5.3 Introducing the role of manufacturing\nIn each of the cases the company background and the role of the manufacturing operation were carefully\npresented prior to the visit commencing. Here, a variety of media were employed to portray business\nsuccesses and heritage. Automotive, Excavators, and FineChina all used videos, SpecialistAuto and\nAutoComponents relied on short presentations by experts, and Confectionary used interactive exhibits.\nTopics included how the company started, its founder, age, original products, how they were designed, major\ncustomers and, importantly, how these traditions and values continue into the present day. For example,\nAutomotive built their reputation on racing and put this message across strongly in their introductory\npresentation. Several companies split their story into eras to provide clarity to the visitor. This was used to\ngood effect by SpecialistAuto to ensure the message conveyed did not contradict any future product\nstrategies.\nThese approaches are consistent with the views of other researchers. Valencia (2005), for example,\nhighlights that the story of the founder and their values presents a powerful opportunity to reinforce the\nbrand. Likewise, Mitchell & Mitchell (1999) observe that looking to the manufacturer\u2019s past generates visitor\nnostalgia and maybe a re-connection with the factory being a significant employer.\n5.4 Guiding visitors through the facility\nIt was evident in the cases that the route through a facility, the manner by which visitors were guided, and\nthe timing of visits were all important considerations in showcasing a facility. The approach taken by\nSpecialistAuto is typical of a carefully planned route seen in many instances. The tour started with an\nintroduction and description of the product being manufactured. Then, visitors we\u2019re guided along highly\nvisible walkways that, in this case, commenced with an automated and visually impressive robot riveting\nsection. On this route housekeeping was of a high standard, dirty and potentially hazardous areas were\navoided, and performance measurement boards were clearly visible and up-to-date. To guide visitors,\nAutomotive, Excavators and SpecialistAuto, all used retired employees as hosts. These tours were\nenhanced by the visitor being given headphones to overcome the factory noise, and even route maps to help\nexplain the facilities being shown. The timing of tours was also controlled. Automotive, for instance,\ncarefully controlled the times of visits to avoid break times and give the impression of a busy and productive\nfactory. Overall, this led us to conclude that a pre-planned, well guided, and carefully managed route is\nvaluable in showcasing a facility\n85.5 Presenting technologies and practices\nMany of the cases chose to exhibit exciting and engaging production technologies. A good example of this\nwas the \u2018firing tunnel\u2019 at FineChina. The tour route deliberately guided the visitor to the end of the tunnel,\ngiving a clear, unobstructed view of the flames licking the sides of the plates being processed at the time.\nThis was visually impressive, easily viewed, and left a lasting impression. The extensive two hour testing of\nevery finished unit at Excavators provided an eye catching demonstration of quality assurance. It was a\nstereotypical heavy engineering image, leaving the visitor with an impression consistent with brand identity.\nThis consistency with brand occurred on several other occasions. For example, Automotive highlight the use\nof modern aluminium riveted and bonded processes, which are entirely consistent with the image they seek\nto promote of a leading sports car manufacturer. Similarly, high levels of robotics and state of the art image\nrecognition inspection equipment added to the brand identity they seek to portray. SpecialistAuto, by\ncontrast, use traditional buildings, along with skilled people crafting wood and forming panels, which is\nentirely consistent with the heritage product they manufacture. FineChina only show the top end, high\nquality, hand crafted areas to visitors, reinforcing the craftsmanship image of the company. Overall, this led\nus to conclude that a valuable policy in showcasing a manufacturing facility is the careful exhibition of\nexciting and engaging production processes that are relevant to the brand identity.\n5.6 Appearance of the workforce\nEach of the companies used workforce appearance to portray a positive workforce image. As pointed out by\nWeller (1997), work wear can increase employee commitment and improve the image, and help the\ncustomer to think the workers are professional and the company is well run. At Excavators, for example,\nwork wear was particularly effective as it appeared to be durable and stylish, which is entirely consistent with\nthe brand image. However, it was interesting to note that the \u2018uniform\u2019 at companies differed to reflect the\nbrand values. Hence, the appropriate uniform in Automotive was of the \u2018professional technician\u2019 where as in\nthe somewhat craft work environments of FineChina and SpecialistAuto an \u2018artesian\u2019 uniform was worn.\n5.7 Appearance of the working environment\nIt is a common perception that factories are dirty, noisy, smelly and negatively impact on the environment.\nHence, a manufacturer who challenges this myth by actively supporting the environment may gain a\ncompetitive edge in this manner. For example, Toyota think customers perceive additional brand value for a\ncompany committed to environmental protection (Johnson, 2005). Here, for example, the guide at\nExcavators first emphasised the landscaping around the factory to enhance the surrounding area. The\nlandscape could be viewed from a good, elevated vantage point from within the office. Then, inside all the\ncompanies there was a clear commitment to creating a clean and organised working environment. Within\nseveral of the cases there was also a conscious effort to exhibit the companies brand within the production\nenvironment. For example, Excavator, FineChina, and Automotive all displayed the company logo on items\nsuch as name badges, desks, hard hats, flags, vehicles, storage bins and even the coffee machine. The\nvisitor was left in know doubt about which company they were visiting.\n5.8 Product placement within manufacture\nThe cases illustrated how companies exhibit their products within their factory. For example, Excavators and\nAutomotive have full size products located within the factory main entrance, administration offices and the\nlandscaped surroundings of the factory. SpecialistAuto and Automotive incorporated finished products into\nthe factory reception area, while FineChina chose to exhibit part-finished items to accentuate the individual\ncontributions to the final product. Storyboards were often used to complement product placement.\nAutoComponents use storyboards to highlight the process stages that walnut wood goes through from seed\nto dashboard, Confectionary utilise videos to describe process stages from bean to bar, and FineChina\nexplain the stages of the firing process using this method.\n5.9 Departure from the facility\nA majority of the companies made sure the visitor took the brand home in the form of mementos about the\nfactory or products. For example, Excavators gave a lanyard with the company logo. Almost all the other\ncompanies had a shop that enabled visitors to purchase branded gifts or, as in the case of FineChina, actual\nproducts that are manufactured by the company. The shop was typically located at the end of the factory at\nthe departure point for visitors.\n6. CONCLUDING REMARKS\nThe aim of this research was to establish a set of guidelines for practitioners seeking to showcase their\nproduction facilities. These guidelines are summarised in table 1, and largely they focus on setting out any\ntour of facilities in such a way that a visitor will have an experience which is consistent with the brand values\nof the host. They cover, for example, that a company has clear and well defined signage leading up to its\nfacility. Upon arrival, the visitor should be met at a formal greeting area which will make guests immediately\n9aware of the company\u2019s successes and offer a sense of corporate history to support their view of the brand.\nThe factory tour should be carried out by well trained guides, following a well defined and safe route, past\nengaging technologies that are consistent with the brand\u2019s identity. No opportunity should be missed to\nreinforce the brand identity, from the work wear of employees, to the signage on car parks. Finally, before\nthe individual leaves the facility the key messages from the experience need to be recapped, and they ought\nto be presented with a branded gift or memento to leave them with a lasting impression of the manufacturing\nfacility.\nThis has been an exploratory study. There are inevitably limitations with our research design, for example,\nthe team could have been better representatives of actual customers of each case company. However, our\nthoughts are that while we should try to overcome such limitations, and that there is a bigger challenge to\naddress. Our aspiration is to actually provide a formal mechanism for incorporating brand identity\nconsiderations in manufacturing system design process. Hence, this paper provides a foundation for such\nconsiderations. The key question for future work is how a manufacturing system should be designed to\nmaximise the support it provides to the brand identity of the products it produces. This will require a much\nbetter understanding of the relationships between product value and manufacture, along with how to quantify\nand deal with the key trade-offs. It will account for the particular brand values the company is aiming to\npromote and provide measurement of the performance of the brand reinforcement. However, if all of this\ncan be achieved we will have a powerful mechanism for sustaining manufacture in the UK.\nReferences\nBMW (2007) BMW Factory Virtual Tour, http:\/\/www.bmwusfactory.com\/build\/, accessed 25 May 2007.\nBrand Index (2005) Best Brand Performers, http:\/\/www.brandindex.com\/, accessed 10 January 2007.\nBrumberg & Axelrod (1995) \u2018Consumer Experience Tourism in the Nonprofit and Public Sectors\u2019 Journal of\nNonprofit & Public Sector Marketing, Volume: 9 Issue: 3\nGofton, K.
