Magma-generated fractures propagate upwards, \nnucleating zones of lithospheric weakness, which focus shear in narrow transcurrent faults or at \nbasin margins.  In this way, magmatism controls fault timing and location.

This mantle is melted to form K-rich magmas in two main \nmantle thermal regimes: i.  A high thermal regime associated with processes such as mantle \nplume impact, e.g., Paran\u00e1 flood basalt province (Gibson et al. 1997; Fig. 1), lithospheric \ndelamination, e.g., Harghita volcanic rocks, eastern Carpathians (G\u00eerbacea and Frisch 1998; Fig. \n1), or lithospheric extension with \u03b2-factor > 2, e.g., Rio Grande rift, USA (Gibson et al. 1993; \nFig. 1), and ii.  a low thermal regime where potassic mafic and felsic rocks are associated with \ntranstension of the lithosphere; in many cases hosted by transtensional strike-slip shear zones, \ne.g., Caledonian shoshonitic magmatism, northern British Isles (Vaughan 1996; Fig. 1). Here we \npresent a tectonomagmatic model for regime ii, arguing that heterogeneously metasomatized \nlithospheric mantle undergoes decompression during Type B transtension (Fossen and Tikoff \n1998), either regionally, or locally due to deviations in stress trajectory, and melts to form \npotassic mafic magmas.  Magma-driven fracturing focusses strain, controls the site of initiation \nand propagation of fault systems and, consequently, determines the local yield strength of the \nlithosphere. \n \nFault control of magmatism \nStructural studies have suggested that pre-existing strike-slip fault systems can act as conduits \nfor and create accumulation spaces for magma (e.g., Pe-Piper et al 1998).  The subject of fault \ncontrol of magmatism is a vast one and a comprehensive review is far outside the scope of this \npaper, however, a few key papers are worth summarising to give some indication of the depth of \nVaughan and Scarrow \n 3\nstudy and the range over which the relevant questions have been addressed.  Links between \nregional deformation and magmatism were first proposed by Balk (1937) and in more detail by \nAnderson (1951).  The modern debate on the links between magmatism and faulting has \nfocussed mainly on granitic magma and began with work on the Donegal granite in northwest \nIreland by Hutton (1982; thoroughly reviewed in Hutton 1988a).  Recent important papers on \ngranite emplacement include Hutton et al. (1990), Hutton & Ingram (1994), Petford et al. (1996), \nBenn et al. (1998); for a counter argument view see Patterson & Vernon (1995).  Recently, \nanisotropy of magnetic susceptibility has emerged as a new and powerful technique for \ndetermining magma emplacement mechanisms (e.g. Bouchez 1997, Moyen 2003).  For mafic \nmagmatism, apart from the well-documented relationship between extension of \u03b2-factor>2 and \nbasaltic magmatism (e.g. McKenzie & Bickle 1988), there is a lot less, although dyke \nemplacement has been implicated in normal fault movement in rift zones (Rubin & Pollard 1988) \nand mafic plutons in the Ivrea-Verbena zone of northern Italy appear to be syn-extensionally \nemplaced (e.g. Quick et al. 1994).  We review the evidence for tectonic control of K-rich \nmagmas below.  In this paper, we turn the argument for fault control of magma emplacement on \nits head, and argue that in one major case, deep-seated magma genesis controls faulting. \n \nMagmatism from K-rich metasomatized mantle and transtension \nStructural emplacement settings for K-rich magmatism, where control is well known, can be \nsummarised as follows: i. fault bends in strike-slip zones (e.g. Turkish Anatolian cinder cones, \nAdiyaman et al. 1998): ii.  strike-slip fault terminations (e.g. Caledonian Strontian granite, \nScotland; Hutton 1988b): iii.  en echelon fissure systems (e.g. Caledonian lamprophyres; \nVaughan 1996); iv.  transverse structures in extensional zones (e.g. Virunga Range potassic \nlavas, East African Rift; Kampunzu et al. 1998), v. intersections between extensional and \nVaughan and Scarrow \n 4\noffsetting faults (e.g. alkaline rocks associated with the Canadian Cordilleran miogeocline; \nGoodfellow et al. 1995), vi. oblique rift zones (e.g. alkaline volcanism in the Dead Sea rift zone, \nSoutheast Turkey; Alici et al. 2001), vii. rift flanks where \u03b2-factors are small (less than 1.2) (e.g. \nthe North Sea; Latin and Waters 1991).  What links these sites of magma transfer and \nemplacement is that they form in zones of transtension (strike-slip deformation that deviates \nfrom simple shear because of a component of extension orthogonal to the deformation zone, \nDewey et al. 1998). \n \nLamentably few studies synthesise geochemical and structural data.  Nonetheless, a close \ntemporal and spatial association between magmatism generated from K-rich metasomatized \nlithospheric mantle and transcurrent shear has been documented at deep and shallow crustal \nlevels in many tectonic settings worldwide (see below).  Although a more comprehensive review \nis beyond the scope of this paper, some well-documented examples will serve to illustrate our \ncase. \n \nTranstension \nIn the Caledonian of Scotland and Ireland (Fig. 1), the initiation of Silurian-Devonian orogen-\nparallel bulk sinistral transtension is coeval with the onset of an episode of K-rich magmatism \nacross a width of the orogen from northwest Scotland to the north of England and eastern \nIreland, a zone spanning 1000 km (Vaughan 1996).  The range of magmatism is diverse, \nincluding shoshonitic lavas, hypabyssal and subvolcanic lamprophyres, and large volumes of K-\nrich plutonic rocks.  Sigmoidal pluton shapes in plan, en echelon dyke arrays, syn-magmatic \ndeformation and juxtaposition of plutonic, hypabyssal and volcanic rocks suggest strongly that \ntranstensional shear zones hosted these magmas (Hutton 1988a, Jacques and Reavy 1994, \nVaughan and Scarrow \n 5\nVaughan 1996).  In the Ross Sea, the potassic McMurdo dyke swarm of the Meander Intrusive \nSuite is coeval with a brief dextral transtensional phase that preceded full rifting (Rossetti et al. \n2001, Rocchi et al. 2002).  In Turkey (Savascin et al. 1994), alkaline magmatism occurred during \ndextral transtensional episodes along the Kirka-Afyon-Isparta structural trend, from Miocene to \nRecent (calc-alkaline magmatism occurs during compressive phases; the Cretaceous Antarctic \nPeninsula shows similar relationships; Scarrow et al. 1997).  More recently still, sinistral strike \nslip faults associated with the transtensional development of the Lake Baikal rift in Siberia \n(Fig.1) localize K-rich monogenetic volcanoes (Delvaux et al. 1997, Lesne et al. 1998).  \nLikewise, in the trans-Mexican volcanic belt (Fig. 1), potassic monogenetic volcanoes are \naligned along arc-parallel fault associated with extension (Alaniz-Alvarez 1998) and sinistral \nstrike-slip (Suter et al. 1995, Suter 1999).  Carboniferous, high-K calc-alkaline plutons and \npotassic to ultrapotassic basalts coincide with a brief phase of extension (Apraiz and Eguiluz \n2002) during sinistral strike-slip movement on the Ossa-Morena suture zone in central western \nSpain (Casquet et al., 2001). \n \nStrike-slip \nContemporaneous intrusion of K-rich plutonic rocks and lamprophyres are directly related to \nstrike-slip along the Elbe Zone of the Bohemian Massif  (Wenzel et al., 2002).  Triassic \nshoshonitic magmas are associated with sinistral strike-slip in the Dolomites of northern Italy \n(Sloman 1989) (Fig. 1).  Mid-Cretaceous dextral strike-slip is associated with the emplacement \nof voluminous potassic granitic rocks in north-central British Columbia (Gabrielse 1991) (Fig. \n1).  In the Tertiary, Eocene emplacement of ultra-alkaline magma into strike-slip faults in eastern \nParaguay was controlled by east-west trending dextral shear (Riccomini et al., 2001).  In marine \nsettings, Tertiary lamprophyres are associated with transform faults on the Sierra Leone rise in \nVaughan and Scarrow \n 6\nthe Atlantic Ocean (Jones et al. 1991)(Fig. 1) and the Owen Fracture Zone ridge off Oman in the \nIndian Ocean (Whitmarsh et al 1974)(Fig. 1). \n \nModel \nMcKenzie (1989) argued that, over geological timescales, perturbation of the asthenosphere \nduring convection causes the first-formed small volumes of potassic melt to percolate up through \nthe upper thermal boundary layer of this mantle.  These small-volumes of melt freeze in the \ncooler top of the thermal boundary layer, the so-called mechanical boundary layer, forming a \nzone of lithospheric mantle that is rich in volatiles and incompatible elements.  This enriched \nzone is easily fusible, i.e. close to its solidus, and is argued to be the source of the earliest \nmagmas during advection of heat to the base of the lithosphere (Harry and Leeman 1995).  \nExtreme compositional heterogeneities in this zone occur on 10-km-scales (e.g. Zhang et al. \n2000), with a large range of compositions, e.g. \u03b5Sr from -2 to +180 and \u03b5Nd from +2 to \u201312 \ninterpreted from potassic and ultrapotassic magmas in the Roman Province (Conticelli et al. \n2002).  \n \nThe tectonic associations outlined above suggest that K-rich alkaline magmatism is linked with \nsmall degrees of extension (\u03b2 ~ 1.2), and commonly is found in zones of transtension.  The \nrelationship between K-rich alkaline magmatism and small degrees of extension suggests a \npositive relationship between degree of metasomatism and ease of melting, and suggests that \nmetsomatised mantle is close to the solidus for normal ranges of lithospheric basal temperature \nand thickness (e.g. Harry and Leeman 1995).  Transtensional zones are associated with \u03b2-factors \nof c. 1.2 (e.g. 1.19\u20131.34 for the Dead Sea rift; Alzoubi and ten Brink 2002; Fig. 1), which is more \nthan enough to achieve adiabatic decompression partial melting in the upper asthenospheric \nVaughan and Scarrow \n 7\nmantle (Pedersen 1994) or in the metasomatically altered lithospheric mantle at depths > 60 km \n(Harry and Leeman 1995). \n \nThe case is simple for bulk transtension (Fig. 2i).  However, bulk simple shear will not produce \nextension.  Fortunately, the lithosphere and mantle are not rheologically homogeneous.  Recent \nstudies show that mantle seismic anisotropy is common (Tommasi and Vauchez 2001), probably \nreflecting mantle flow structures produced during orogenesis, and studies of transform fault \nbehaviour in areas of strong oceanic lithosphere indicate that stress fields cause strike\u2013slip faults \nto avoid very thick and strong lithosphere (Ligi et al. 2002).  We propose that for lithosphere and \nupper mantle with realistic variations in rheological contrast (e.g. cratons separated by mobile \nbelts or upper mantle with pre-existing anisotropy (Fig. 2ii) stress trajectories during bulk simple \nshear will deviate to produce localized zones of transpression and transtension (of probable Type \nB, Fossen and Tikoff 1998) (Fig. 2ii).  For example, strike-slip dominates west of the Siberian \nCraton, whereas to the south, a zone of extension to transtension (forming the Baikal Rift) is \nactive (A. Vauchez pers. comm. 2002; Lesne et al. 1998).  Adiabatically induced melting is \nlikely to occur first in the most volatile-rich and most easily fusible volumes of the lithospheric \nmantle (Fig. 2b).  So, during the initiation of bulk transtension or horizontal simple shear, \nadiabatic decompression in zones of transtension will trigger partial melting in small-scale (i.e. \n10-km) zones of metasomatically enriched mantle at the base of the lithosphere, at \u03b2-factors of c. \n1.2. Transtension will nucleate dykes in the manner of tension veins in a homogeneous \ndeforming solid.  Magma-driven fractures will then propagate rapidly to upper levels of the \nlithosphere, nucleating a zone of lithospheric weakness that will focus shear strain and form the \nzone of initiation of a strike-slip fault (Fig. 2c).  Shear systems may show initial tensional arrays \nof K-rich basaltic dykes cut by later more planar P shear zones hosting granite magma (e.g. \nVaughan and Scarrow \n 8\nVaughan 1996; Fig. 2c).  In this way, K-rich mantle metasomatism controls the location of \nfaulting and the resulting K-rich magmas control fault propagation. \n \nDiscussion \nTiming relationships are key to our model.  So far it has not been possible to demonstrate that \nbulk lithospheric shearing predates magmatism, although in the best-documented examples, i.e. \nthe Caledonian (Vaughan 1996) and the Ross Sea (Rossetti et al. 2001, Rocchi et al. 2002), \nmagmatism and transtension are at least coeval.  Vauchez et al. (1997) have also proposed \nmutual relationships between strike-slip faulting and potassic magmatism, and Neves et al. \n(1996) have suggested that magma accumulations in the lithosphere form nuclei for transcurrent \nshear zones, but further work is required.  A key consequence of our model is that magmatism \nassociated with transtension in the early stages of lithospheric strike-slip or rifting will focus \nstrain and nucleate major faults.  Heterogeneities in K-rich metasomatism will fundamentally \ncontrol the local yield strength of lithosphere, even if over a very large scale, thermal effects are \nimportant, such as those induced by delamination of the base of the lithosphere.  Another \nconsequence is that decompression melting of metasomatised mantle and subsequent alkaline \nmagmatism may also control rift localisation.  \n \nGiven that this model concentrates strain in a narrow zone, defusing more distributed \nlithospheric shear, it could be argued that once a fault system is initiated in this way it should \nbecome the main focus of strike-slip shear at the expense of formation of any further systems.  \nThis indeed appears to be the case for the Red River shear zone in China (Fig. 1), where an \nalkaline-magma-lubricated zone is taking up much of the differential movement associated with \nthe extrusion of Southeast Asia during the India\u2013Eurasia collision (Zhang and Scharer 1999).  \nVaughan and Scarrow \n 9\nStrike slip faults nucleated in this way will create space for the accumulation of K-rich granite \nmagma and a site of preservation of continental crust.  Volumetrically, potassic granites, such as \nthe Newer Granites of the Caledonide orogen (e.g. Soper 1986), form a significant proportion of \nthe crust, particularly in post-orogenic settings.  The intimate connection between potassic \nmagmatism and strike-slip faulting argued for here suggests that the relationship has the \ncharacteristics of a tectonomagmatic association such as the orogenic magma series, and this \nechoes recent suggestions that strike-slip related K-rich magmatism is common in post-orogenic \nsettings (Bonin et al 1998).  This represents a hitherto unrecognised tectonomagmatic association \nas important as, for example, the ocean island magma series.  Finally, our model, although not \ninvalidating the generally accepted view of fault control of magma transport and \naccommodation, proposes the converse i.e. that K-rich magmatism, generated at the base of \nmetasomatized lithosphere by regional or local transtension, controls the nucleation and location \nof transcurrent fault systems.  Even though resulting magmatism will be coeval with fault \ndevelopment and volcanoes will appear fault-controlled, our model suggests the opposite.  \nMagmatism will control fault timing and location, i.e., faults will be volcano-controlled.  The \ndistinction may appear to be a subtle one, but our model allows for the formation of new faults in \nunfaulted lithosphere, which has a bearing on the formation of plates (Bercovici 2003). \n \nConclusions \ni. A close temporal and spatial association exists between K-rich magmatism and \ntranstension, having been documented at deep and shallow crustal levels in many tectonic \nsettings worldwide.  \nii. Our new model indicates that bulk transtension, or local transtension during bulk simple \nshear, of heterogeneously enriched lithospheric mantle triggers localised K-rich magmatism. \nVaughan and Scarrow \n 10\niii.

This association represents a hitherto unrecognised genetic relationship between tectonics and \nmagmatism as significant as, for example, the ocean island magma series. \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe would like to thank Philip Leat, Adolphe Nicholas, Alain Vauchez, and Renoud Vissers for \nreviews and suggestions that substantially improved the manuscript. \nVaughan and Scarrow \n 11\nReferences  \nAdiyaman, O., Chorowicz, J. and Kose, O., 1998.
