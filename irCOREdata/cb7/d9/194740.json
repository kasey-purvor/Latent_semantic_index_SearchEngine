The deflated and compressed magnetotail is predicted to have a radius as small as\n12 RE at this time. The magnetotail does not reinflate to more typical dimensions until\nsome time after a southward turning of the IMF, leading to accumulation of open flux\nthrough low latitude reconnection. We compare our observations with estimates of the\nshape of the magnetopause from an empirical model. We also present a simple model of\nthe varying length of the magnetotail, based on upstream solar wind conditions, and\nobservations of the size of the polar cap.

Introduction\n[2] It has been demonstrated in several case examples\n[see Milan et al., 2003, and references within] that\nchanges in the area of the polar cap, defined here as\nthat region of the ionosphere threaded by open field lines,\nare related to the occurrence of magnetic reconnection at\nthe magnetopause or in the magnetotail. The ability to\nmeasure the area of the polar cap quantifies the amount\nof open flux in the magnetosphere and thereby allows the\nstorage and release of magnetic energy within the system,\ntapped from the flow of the solar wind, to be monitored.\nThis magnetic energy is stored through the formation of a\nmagnetotail, and thus it is to be expected that the\nmagnetotail should inflate and deflate in response to\nchanges in polar cap area. It is the aim of the current\npaper to investigate this subject.\n[3] The magnetospheric cavity forms within the solar\nwind as the antisunward flowing plasma is deflected by\nthe impenetrable obstacle presented by the Earth\u2019s magnetic\nfield (see Figure 1). This field is compressed until the\nelevated magnetic pressure balances the stress exerted\nnormal to the magnetospheric boundary, the magnetopause,\nby the ram or dynamic pressure Pdyn of the solar wind\n[Chapman and Ferraro, 1931; Mead and Beard, 1964].\nUnder typical solar wind conditions the subsolar magneto-\npause stand-off distance is close to 10 RE. Tangential\nstresses applied to the magnetopause pull the Earth\u2019s field\ninto a long magnetotail. Dungey [1961] proposed that these\ntangential stresses arose as a consequence of magnetic\nreconnection between the Earth\u2019s field and the interplane-\ntary magnetic field (IMF) embedded within the solar wind\n(near point A in Figure 1). This results in a proportion of\nterrestrial field lines which interconnect across the magne-\ntopause with the IMF (points C in Figure 1) and which are\nthen stretched by the flow of the solar wind. Dungey [1965]\nestimated that field lines remained linked to the solar wind,\nor \u2018\u2018open,\u2019\u2019 for approximately 4 hours before being closed\nby magnetic reconnection in the magnetotail (at point B),\nresulting in a tail some 1000 RE in length. This tail flares\nslightly, from a radial dimension of \u000315 RE near the Earth\nto perhaps \u000330 RE some distance down-tail, such that the\ncomponent of the solar wind dynamic pressure acting\nnormal to the magnetopause (2Pdyn cos\n2 x for specular\nreflection of the solar wind from the boundary) balances\nthe internal magnetic pressure [e.g., Caan et al., 1973;\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 109, A04220, doi:10.1029\/2003JA010350, 2004\n1Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester,\nLeicester, UK.\n2NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland, USA.\n3Space Science Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley,\nCalifornia, USA.\n4Space Environment Center, Boulder, Colorado, USA.\nCopyright 2004 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/04\/2003JA010350\nA04220 1 of 16\nPetrinec and Russell, 1996]. Coroniti and Kennel [1972]\nestimated that beyond X \u0003 \u0002150 RE the tail is of uniform\nradius, the normal stress on the magnetopause being deter-\nmined entirely by the isotropic solar wind thermal and\nmagnetic pressures. These calculations suggest that the\nmagnetic field strength within the magnetotail necessary\nto balance the external forces is approximately 20 nT in the\nnear-Earth tail, dropping to 9 nT in the distant tail. These\nestimates of magnetotail dimension and field strength have\nsubsequently been borne out by studies with IMP-6 and\nISEE-3 magnetic data (e.g., Slavin et al. [1985]; also see\nreviews of Ness [1987] and Fairfield [1987]).\n[4] The cross-sectional area of the tail and its internal\nmagnetic field strength are clearly also determined by the\namount of open flux contained within the magnetosphere\n(see, for example, Unti and Atkinson [1968] and review\nof Russell and McPherron [1973]). The magnetotail\ncomprises two back-to-back D-shaped regions of open\nflux, the magnetotail lobes which map to the northern and\nsouthern ionospheric polar caps, sandwiched between\nwhich is the plasma sheet (Figure 1). As the amount of\nopen flux in the system waxes and wanes, the tail should\ninflate and deflate in concert [e.g., Unti and Atkinson,\n1968; Holzer and Slavin, 1979]. Caan et al. [1975] found\nthat the magnetic energy density within the tail increased\nduring substorm growth phase and was subsequently\nreleased during the substorm expansion phase. This was\nalso examined by Fairfield [1986], who noted that\nspacecraft in both the near-Earth magnetotail [Maezawa,\n1975] and distant magnetotail [Baker et al., 1984] had\nbeen observed to move into and out of the tail in response\nto substorm growth and expansion phase, respectively.\nThis was interpreted by Fairfield as the tail inflating in\nresponse to the accumulation of open flux in the magne-\ntosphere and correspondingly deflating at the onset of\nreconnection in the tail. In this study we take this theme\nfurther by examining the motion of the IMP-8 spacecraft\nrelative to the tail magnetopause and correlate this\nwith a measurement of the quantity of open flux in the\nsystem.\n[5] We concentrate on an interval that has previously been\nstudied to determine the dayside auroral and convection\ndynamics in response to northward IMF and high-latitude\nreconnection [Milan et al., 2000a] and southward IMF and\nlow-latitude reconnection [Milan et al., 2000b]. Here we\ninvestigate changes in the area of the polar cap throughout the\ninterval and show how changes in the open flux content of the\nmagnetosphere affect the configuration of the magnetotail. It\nis found that following the incidence of a solar wind shock\nwave on the magnetosphere, a large substorm leads to a\ndramatic reduction in the area of the polar cap and the\nmagnetotail appears to deflate. The magnetotail subsequently\nreinflates after the onset of dayside low-latitude reconnection\nin response to a southward turning of the IMF. We compare\nour estimates of magnetotail dimension with the empirical\nmodel presented by Shue et al. [1998], which is parameter-\nized by the upstream solar wind dynamic pressure and the\nnorth-south Bz component of the IMF.\n2. Observations\n[6] The period of observation covers approximately\n0400\u20132400 UT, 26 August 1998 (day 238), though we\nconcentrate in detail on the interval 0400\u20131230 UT, when\nionospheric observations allow the size of the polar cap to\nbe quantified. Several spacecraft are employed to monitor\nthe state of the magnetosphere during this interval. Figure 2\nprovides an overview of the spacecraft orbits between 0400\nand 2400 UT, in the GSE X-Z and X-Y planes, dots\nindicating their locations at 1000 UT. Far upstream of the\nEarth, ACE and Wind provide information regarding the\napproaching solar wind and IMF conditions. Geotail, just\nupstream of the bow shock, gives independent confirmation\nof the solar wind propagation delay. The UV imager\nonboard the Polar spacecraft captures images of the north-\nern hemisphere auroral configuration, from which the area\nof the polar cap can be estimated, aided by measurements of\nprecipitating particles at low altitudes from the FAST\nspacecraft. Being located near the northern lobe magneto-\npause down-tail at X \u0001 \u000225 RE, the IMP-8 spacecraft\nFigure 1. A schematic of the magnetosphere in the GSE X-Z and Y-Z planes.

During our interval the solar wind\ndynamic pressure varies considerably and the location of the\nmagnetopause is expected to change accordingly. Super-\nimposed by dashed lines are predictions of the magneto-\npause location when the magnetosphere is at its least (prior\nto 0700 UT) and most (\u00030730 UT) compressed, based on\nthe model of Shue et al. [1998]. The magnetopause location\nis expected to pass over the position of IMP-8, but other\nnear-Earth spacecraft are contained within the magneto-\nsphere at all times. We now present the observations from\neach spacecraft in turn. From here on in, spacecraft loca-\ntions are described in GSE coordinates and magnetic field\ncomponents in GSM coordinates.\n2.1. Solar Wind and IMF: ACE, Wind, and Geotail\n[7] Wind and ACE are located at X \u0001 120 RE and 248 RE,\nrespectively, both within 25\u201330 RE of the Sun-Earth line.\nGeotail is located just upstream of the Earth\u2019s bowshock,\nnear X \u0001 20 RE. Allowing for the propagation delay of the\nsolar wind, comparison of the solar wind and IMF param-\neters measured by these three spacecraft indicate an ex-\ntremely close correspondence between the observations,\ndespite the distance between them. Ideally, the Geotail\nmeasurements would be used to characterize the incoming\nsolar wind, but large gaps in this data-set mean that we\nconcentrate instead on the Wind observations, shown in\nFigure 3. The three components of the IMF are shown in\nFigures 3a\u20133c in GSM coordinates, with solar wind speed\nVSW and number density NSW, ion and electron temperatures\nTi and Te, and the solar wind dynamic pressure Pdyn =\nmpNSWVSW\n2 (where mp is the proton mass, and we have\nincluded a 5% contribution from He), indicated below in\nFigures 3d\u20133g, respectively. Of most interest to this study\nis the sharp increase in Pdyn from 2 to 12 nPa seen near\n0640 UT and the subsequent return to more quiescent\nconditions in the following hours. The solar wind speed\nassociated with the shock front is 600 km s\u00021, which would\nusually lead to an estimated propagation delay between\nobservations at Wind and arrival at the magnetopause of\nFigure 2.

However, the shock front is clearly travel-\ning faster than this, and Geotail observations suggest a\ndelay of 10\u201315 min. The arrival of the shock front at the\nmagnetosphere near 0655 UT marks the onset of a\ngeomagnetic storm, identified by the characteristic initial,\nmain, and recovery phases in Dst [Matsushita, 1967]. The\nstorm has a two-stage onset, the initial phase occurring at\nthe shock arrival, Dst reaching a first minimum of \u000250 nT\nat 2100 UT, before the full main phase (\u0002155 nT) on the\nfollowing day. Following the shock front the IMF is\ndirected strongly northward (Bz \u0001 +10 nT) for 3 hours.\nThe auroral dynamics observed during this 3-hour interval\nhave previously been reported by Milan et al. [2000a].\nSubsequently, the IMF turns strongly southward (Bz \u0001\n\u000210 nT), first arriving at the magnetosphere at around\n0950 UT; the auroral dynamics observed at this time\nformed the basis of studies by Milan et al. [2000b] and\nLockwood et al. [2001]. The interested reader is directed\nto these three papers for a more detailed description of\nthe small-scale dynamics observed at these times.\n2.2. Polar Ionosphere: Polar UVI and FAST\n[8] As indicated above, the arrival of the shock front in\nthe solar wind heralds an interval of enhanced geomagnetic\nactivity. Figure 3h shows the variation of the AL and AU\ngeomagnetic indices for the period in question; the AE\nindex is given by the difference between AU and AL [Davis\nand Sugiura, 1966]. The characteristic signatures of several\nsubstorms can be discerned, the expansion phase onsets\nbeing indicated by arrows. We refer to these as substorm\nbreakups 1 to 9 (SB1\u2013SB9). Perhaps the AL\/AU signatures\nof some of the breakups we have identified are not that\nclear; observations shown later will strengthen the case\nfor these. Of most interest to the present study are SB1, 2,\nand 3, as these occur when UV images are available, though\nmany of the others will be shown to have a direct impact on\nthe configuration of the magnetotail also. SB1 to 3 occur at\napproximately 0455, 0655, and 1030 UT, respectively. SB1\nhas a relatively small peak in AE of 500 nT, though SB2\nand SB3 have larger peak values of 1300 and 1200 nT,\nrespectively.\n[9] The Ultraviolet Instrument (UVI) onboard Polar [Torr\net al., 1995] provides images of the northern hemisphere\nauroral configuration from before the arrival of the shock\nfront until approximately 1220 UT. Figure 4 shows the time-\nsequence of auroral luminosity in the LBHs band along the\nnoon-midnight magnetic meridian A\u2013B (a) and two cuts\nfrom dusk to dawn C\u2013D (b) and E\u2013F (c), for the interval\n0400\u20131230 UT (these meridians are indicated in Figure 5b).\nSeveral times are marked on Figure 4a, corresponding to\nthe auroral images shown in Figures 5a\u20135l in a magnetic\nlatitude and MLT frame. Concentric circles in Figure 5b\nmark magnetic latitudes of 60\u0003, 70\u0003, and 80\u0003, and magnetic\nnoon is located at the top of each panel. We show two dawn-\ndusk meridians, as Figure 4b allows the dynamics of the\ndayside aurora to be investigated, whereas Figure 4c focuses\non the nightside phenomena, such as the substorm auroral\nbulge.\n[10] A brightening of the nightside auroral oval at\n0455 UT (Figure 4c) marks the onset of the first substorm\nSB1, though the auroral effects of this are relatively minor.\nThe most spectacular dynamics occur after the arrival of the\nsolar wind shock front. Prior to the arrival of the shock\nthe auroral oval is relatively dim (Figure 5a). The first\nvisible sign of the incidence of the shock, a brightening of\nthe dayside auroral oval, is observed at 0652 UT. This is\naccompanied by a short-lived auroral brightening at post-\nnoon midlatitudes (0655 UT, Figure 5b), known as a\ndayside detached aurora, a recognized signature of sudden\nsolar wind dynamic pressure enhancements and northward\nIMF [see Zhang et al., 2003, and references therein]. At\nthe same time, the nightside, especially premidnight, oval\nbrightens considerably, and a large auroral substorm (SB2)\ncommences. The substorm bulge progresses polewards\nover the next half hour (Figures 5c\u20135e), reaching almost\nto the geomagnetic pole along the noon-midnight meridian\n(Figure 4a). By 0747 UT (Figure 5f), most of the polar\nregion is covered by auroral luminosity. Following this, the\nbulge luminosity fades (Figures 5f\u20135i), to leave a faint\nnightside auroral oval with its poleward edge near 70\u0003\nlatitude, close to its original location prior to the storm\nonset (Figure 4a). As the substorm bulge fades after\n0730 UT, two transpolar arcs become apparent, especially\nafter 0830 UT and most clearly seen in Figure 5i. The\npresence of these transpolar arcs indicates that at least some\nof the polar region comprises closed field lines [e.g.,\nHenderson et al., 1996].\nFigure 4. (a\u2013c) Auroral luminosity as a function of time\nalong three meridians indicated in Figure 5b, as observed by\nPolar UVI. Latitudes are geomagnetic. Darker shading\nindicates brighter aurora.\nA04220 MILAN ET AL.: OPEN FLUX CONTENT OF THE MAGNETOTAIL\n4 of 16\nA04220\n[11] Throughout this period (0700\u20130950 UT, Figures 5b\u2013\n5i), the noon sector oval shows considerable and dynamic\nvariations in brightness, though with an overall trend of\npoleward motion from near 75\u0003 to 85\u0003 latitude (Figure 4a).\nAt the same time the dawn and dusk sector auroral zones\nare seen to progress polewards from 73\u0003 to 77\u0003 latitude\n(Figure 4b). The short time-scale variations in the lumi-\nnosity are associated with an auroral spot located just\npoleward of the noon auroral oval (most obvious in\nFigures 5h and 5i), associated with the northward IMF\ncusp [Milan et al., 2000a; Fuselier et al., 2002; Frey et\nal., 2003].\n[12] After 0950 UT the IMF turns southward. The\nauroral oval progresses rapidly to lower latitudes, from\n85\u0003 to 70\u0003 latitude along the noon meridian (Figure 4a)\nand from 75\u0003 to 65\u0003 along the dusk meridian (Figure 4b)\nby 1050 UT. Small-scale auroral dynamics observed in\nthe noon and dusk sectors during this period are consis-\ntent with episodic, low-latitude merging [Milan et al.,\n2000b; Lockwood et al., 2001]. Unfortunately, the overall\nresponse of the midnight and dawn sector ovals to the\nsouthward turning of the IMF cannot be determined, as\nthe field-of-view of the UVI camera diminishes in size as\nPolar moves away from apogee. We reasonably assume,\nhowever, that the auroral oval expands to lower latitudes\nat all local times. By 1103 UT (Figure 5k, a composite of\ntwo images taken just before and just after a repointing of\nthe UVI camera), the oval has expanded to very low\nlatitudes and another substorm breakup (SB3) has oc-\ncurred. The poleward motion of the bulge can been seen\nin Figure 4a. It is clear from these observations that the\nopen polar cap does not at this time decrease in size to\nthe same extent as following the solar wind shock.\n[13] The occurrence of substorm break-up indicates the\nonset of magnetic reconnection in the magnetotail, involv-\ning the closure of open flux. The substorm bulge delineates\nthe ionospheric projection of the region of previously open\nlobe magnetic field lines that are closed by this reconnec-\ntion. In Figure 5e it is clear that at least half of the open flux\npresent before the onset of substorm SB2 is closed by\n0730 UT. New open flux can be created by dayside recon-\nnection at low latitudes, but this is not expected to occur\nwhen the IMF is directed northward, as it is until 0950 UT.\nThus even though the substorm bulge diminishes in bright-\nness such that most of the polar ionosphere appears largely\ndevoid of auroras (e.g., Figure 5j), we suggest that much of\nthis region is still closed. We employ four overpasses of the\npolar region by the FAST spacecraft to confirm this.\n[14] Figure 6 shows spectrograms of precipitating ions\nand electrons from FAST overpasses of the northern hemi-\nsphere polar regions centered around 0545, 0800, 1010, and\n1220 UT, each pass lasting some 30 min or so. The\nfootprint of these overpasses are shown in Figures 5a, 5g,\n5j, and 5l. In each case the FAST spacecraft progressed\nfrom the postnoon to the postmidnight sector, all four\npasses following a similar track. In the first overpass\n(Figure 5a), high fluxes of \u000310 keV ions and electrons\n(0533\u20130535 UT and 0601\u20130606 UT) are indicative of\ntrapped particles on closed field lines. More sporadic and\nlower energy (though >1 keV) ions and electrons on the\nnightside (0556\u20130601 UT) must also be present on closed\nfield lines, as no mechanism is known for accelerating\nparticles to such energies on open field lines. Similar\nenergies on the dayside (0535\u20130537 UT), poleward of\nhigher energy fluxes, are assumed to be present on open,\nthough recently reconnected, field lines, particles being\naccelerated by the merging process. Figure 5 of Milan et\nal. [2003] indicates how such fluxes relate to the location\nof the merging gap and open\/closed field line boundary for\nboth northward and southward IMF. Regions devoid of\nions and with only low energy (<300 eV) electrons,\nknown as polar rain, are indicative of open field lines.\nIn this case, then, the spacecraft traverses open field lines\nfrom 0535\u20130555 UT, indicated by the black bar at the top\nof Figure 6a and in bold on the satellite track of Figure 5a,\ncorresponding to a relatively large polar cap. In sharp\ncontrast, the second overpass (Figure 6b) encounters\nalmost continual fluxes of high energy particles all the\nway across the polar region. Trapped particles are ob-\nserved at the dayside crossing of the auroral zone (0746\u2013\n0748 UT). Poleward of this (0748\u20130755 UT), fluxes are\nassumed to correspond to recently reconnected (high-\nFigure 5. Snapshots of auroral luminosity presented in\na magnetic latitude and local time frame, observed by\nPolar UVI at selected times during the interval of interest.\nFigure 5b indicates the three meridians of Figure 4 and the\nlocii of magnetic latitudes 60\u0003, 70\u0003, and 80\u0003; local noon is at\nthe top of each panel. The ground track of the FAST\nspacecraft is indicated in four panels, the thicker bar\nindicating the presence of open field lines.\nA04220 MILAN ET AL.: OPEN FLUX CONTENT OF THE MAGNETOTAIL\n5 of 16\nA04220\nlatitude merging site) open field lines. Particle energies\nrise again (0755\u20130757 UT) as the spacecraft traverses a\nregion of faint luminosity associated with the transpolar\narcs (Figure 5g), presumably located on closed field lines.\nFollowing this is a very short interval of fluxes consistent\nwith polar rain on open field lines (0757\u20130758 UT). The\nrest of the polar crossing indicates continual precipitation\non closed field lines. Regions of open field lines are\nindicated in bold on the track overlaid on Figure 5g.\nThe apparent coincidence of very bright aurora with open\nfield lines is a consequence of a poleward motion of the\ndayside auroral oval during the \u000330 min duration of\nthe FAST overpass: at 0748 UT, when FAST crosses the\ndayside auroral zone, the bright aurora are located equa-\ntorward of the open field line region. More importantly,\nmost of the nightside polar ionosphere is seen to project to\nclosed field lines, despite auroral luminosities being very\ndim in this region.\n[15] The third FAST overpass observes a similar parti-\ncle environment to the second. The identification of\nprecipitating fluxes consistent with open field lines is\nindicated in Figure 6c and Figure 5j. In other words,\nalthough low latitude reconnection has been ongoing for\nsome 20 min by the time the spacecraft traverses the\nnightside polar regions, most of this region is still closed.\nBy the time of the fourth overpass, however, FAST encoun-\nters polar rain, indicative of open field lines, along the\nmajority of its track (Figure 6d), very similar to the first\noverpass. This track is superimposed on an auroral image\ntaken just before the start of the overpass (Figure 5l), as\nafter this time very little of the auroral oval is observed\nby UVI.\n[16] We summarize these observations as follows. Prior to\nsubstorm breakup SB2 a large region of open flux is\nencompassed within the auroral oval. After the arrival of\nthe shock front and the onset of substorm-related tail\nreconnection, the region of open flux contracts to less than\nhalf of its original size over a period of 30\u201340 min. At this\ntime the IMF is directed northward, so no new open flux is\ncreated by dayside low-latitude reconnection. However, the\nluminosity within the nightside polar region diminishes,\npresumably as a consequence of a reduction of the precip-\nitation from the plasma sheet. It is not until the southward\nturning of the IMF that low-latitude reconnection at the\nmagnetopause creates new open flux and the auroral zone\nexpands to lower latitudes to accommodate the increasing\nFigure 6.

In section 3.1 we determine the\nvariation in open flux more quantitatively.\n2.3. Magnetotail: IMP-8\n[17] During the interval of interest the IMP-8 spacecraft is\nlocated near the northern lobe magnetopause, 25 RE down-\ntail of the Earth (see Figure 2). At the start of the interval the\nspacecraft is located within the magnetosphere, but as its\ntrajectory carries it in the negative Y direction it is expected\nto make an outbound crossing of the magnetopause into the\nmagnetosheath at some time during our period of observa-\ntions. In fact, IMP-8 makes several crossings of the mag-\nnetopause as the magnetosphere is compressed and expands\nin response to changes in solar wind dynamic pressure and\nmagnetotail configuration. It is the timing of these magne-\ntopause crossings on which we now concentrate.\n[18] Unfortunately, no IMP-8 plasma measurements are\navailable at this time. However, Figures 7a\u20137d present\nmagnetic field measurements from IMP-8 (Bx, By, Bz in\nGSM coordinates and total field magnitude BT, respectively)\nfrom the period 0400\u20132400 UT. Superimposed are the\nWind magnetic field measurements of the IMF, time lagged\nby 18 min to account for the propagation delay of the solar\nwind, indicated by dotted curves. At the start of the interval,\nBx measured by IMP-8 has a value close to 20 nT and By\nand Bz are small. This orientation and field magnitude is\nconsistent with the northern lobe, field lines being stretched\nantisunward but pointing towards the Earth to form the\nmagnetotail (Figure 1). At approximately 0700 UT, the time\nof the arrival of the solar wind shock at the magnetosphere,\nthe IMP-8 Bx component changes sign abruptly. For the\nnext 3 1\/2 hours the IMP-8 measurements closely resemble\nthose of Wind, in direction if not magnitude, suggesting that\nIMP-8 has exited the magnetosphere and is sampling the\nmagnetosheath field.\n[19] Figure 7f shows the ratio of the total field strengths\nmeasured by IMP-8 and Wind, rB = BT (IMP \u0002 8)\/BT\n(Wind). At the start of the interval, IMP-8 is within the\nmagnetosphere and rB is close to 4, that is the magneto-\nspheric field strength is much greater than that in the IMF.\nWhen IMP-8 enters the magnetosheath and hence measures\na similar field to Wind, rB drops to a value near 1.5. As this\nvalue is greater than unity, it indicates that the magneto-\nsheath field is compressed with respect to the IMF. At\napproximately 1030 UT, Bx as measured by IMP-8 increases\nback to lobe values, at this time near 30 nT, indicating a\nreentry of the magnetosphere. At this time, rB increases\nabove 2 again as the magnetospheric field intensity is much\ngreater than the IMF. Following this, there are subsequent\noutbound and inbound crossings of the magnetopause, at\n1110, 1255, 1330, 1445, and 2130 UT; each crossing is\nindicated by a vertical dashed line. We employ the criterion\nthat rB > 2 to demarcate between intervals when IMP-8 is\nlocated within the magnetosphere and within the magneto-\nsheath rB < 2. This demarcation has been followed through\nto Figure 7h, which indicates the distance of IMP-8 from the\nGSE X-axis, the axis of symmetry of the magnetotail, or in\nother words R2 = Y2 + Z2; this curve is plotted thick when\nthe spacecraft is within the magnetosphere and thin when\nit is within the magnetosheath. R increases with time as\nIMP-8 moves to increasing Y along its orbit. In addition, the\ndotted line indicates the Shue et al. [1998] prediction of the\nFigure 7.

[1998] model (dotted curve).\nA04220 MILAN ET AL.: OPEN FLUX CONTENT OF THE MAGNETOTAIL\n7 of 16\nA04220\nradius of the magnetotail, at the X of IMP-8, parameterized\nby the upstream Pdyn and IMF Bz measurements made by\nWind.\n[20] At the start of the interval the radius of the magnetotail\nis predicted to be approximately 24 RE, placing IMP-8 well\ninside the magnetosphere (this time interval corresponds to\nthe least compressed magnetopause shown in Figure 2).\nFollowing the arrival of the solar wind shock the magneto-\nsphere is expected to be compressed to within a radius of\n16 RE or so (the most compressed magnetopause in Figure 2)\nand IMP-8 exits into the magnetosheath as predicted. With\nthe subsequent decline in Pdyn, and especially the southward\nturning of the IMF, the magnetopause is predicted to expand\nover the spacecraft at 0950 UT. However, IMP-8 continues to\nmake measurements consistent with the magnetosheath until\n1030 UT. Thereafter, until about 1800 UT, there is some\ncorrespondence (within 1 RE or so) between changes in\npredicted location of the magnetopause and entries or exits\nof the magnetosphere by IMP-8. After 1800 UT, although the\nmagnetopause is predicted to be compressed within the\nlocation of IMP-8, the spacecraft remains in the lobe until\n2130 UT. However, transient decreases in Bx and BT mea-\nsured by IMP-8 after 2000 UT indicate that the spacecraft is\nlocated very close inside the magnetopause at this time. It is\nthe departure from predicted behavior at 0950\u20131030 UT that\nwe concentrate on in this study.\n[21] Before moving on, we note that the lobe field\nstrength, measured when IMP-8 is within the magneto-\nsphere, changes from near 20 nT at the start of the interval\nto 30 nT and above after 1000 UT. The increase in lobe field\nstrength appears to correspond with the increase in Pdyn of\nthe solar wind (Figure 7e), and this can easily be understood\nas a compression of the magnetotail until stress balance is\nachieved between an elevated magnetic pressure inside the\ntail Pmag and the magnetosheath dynamic pressure acting\nagainst the flared magnetopause. To demonstrate this, in\nFigure 8a we plot Pdyn (Wind) and Pmag = BT\n2\/2m0 (IMP-8)\ntogether, though on different scales. A good qualitative fit is\nfound between Pdyn and Pmag when IMP-8 is within the\nlobe, indicated by bars, except near magnetopause crossings\nwhen IMP-8 clearly traverses a boundary layer. A constant\nof proportionality close to 0.1 is found, i.e., Pmag \u0001 0.1Pdyn.\n[22] As a check that this constant of proportionality is\nconsistent with our expectations, we use the angle that\nthe lobe magnetic field makes to the GSE X-axis, y =\ncos\u00021Bx\/BT, as a proxy for the flaring of the magnetotail (see\nFigure 1). As discussed in the Introduction, the normal\nstress applied to the magnetopause by the solar wind ram\npressure should be close to 2Pdyn cos\n2 x, so we expect that\nthe constant of proportionality be close to 2cos2 x \u0001\n2cos2(90\u0003 \u0002 y). We show y in Figure 7g and find that it\nvaries mainly between 8\u0003 and 15\u0003 when IMP-8 is in the\nlobe. We note that y tends to increase (the flaring increases)\nduring substorm growth phases and to decrease following\nsubstorm onset, most obvious following SB1, 5, 7, and 8.\nThis indicates that the flaring increases as open flux\naccumulates in the tail, and the flaring decreases as the tail\ndeflates [cf. Unti and Atkinson, 1968]. Flaring angles of\nbetween 8\u0003 and 15\u0003 give values of cos2 x between 0.04 and\n0.13, bracketing the 0.1 constant of proportionality found\nabove. So far our analysis does not take into account\nthe contributions of the magnetosheath gas and magnetic\npressures to the normal stress on the magnetopause; these\nwill be considered in section 3.2.\n2.4. Geosynchronous Orbit: GOES and LANL\n[23] The GOES 8 and 10 satellites, situated at geosyn-\nchronous orbit, cross the noon-midnight meridian close to\n0500 and 0900 UT, respectively. Both are located on the\nnightside during our interval of interest and so are ideally\nlocated to determine changes in the near-Earth magnetotail\nfield structure associated with the arrival of the solar wind\nshock and in the subsequent hours. The GOES spacecraft\nmeasure magnetic field components known as Hp, He, and\nHn, where Hp is perpendicular to the satellite orbital plane\n(parallel to the Earth\u2019s spin axis since the plane is very close\nto 0\u0003 inclination), He is perpendicular to Hp and directed\nearthward, and the third orthogonal component Hn points\neastward. In this study we employ the angle of the magnetic\nfield to the satellite-Earth line in the north-south meridian,\nthat is q = tan\u00021Hp\/He, to determine how dipolar or tail-like\nFigure 8.

Dots indicate\nvariations in the predicted field strength for different\nassumed flaring angles of the magnetotail (see text for\ndetails).\nA04220 MILAN ET AL.: OPEN FLUX CONTENT OF THE MAGNETOTAIL\n8 of 16\nA04220\nthe field is at X \u0001 \u00026 RE (see Figure 1). Figure 9 shows the\nvariation of the three magnetic field components, as well as\nthe total field, (Figures 9a and 9b for GOES 8 and 10,\nrespectively) and the variation of q (Figure 9c) between\n0400 and 1230 UT. The spacecraft are located at magnetic\nlatitudes of L = 10.8\u0003 and 4.4\u0003, respectively, and conse-\nquently if the Earth\u2019s magnetic field was purely dipolar then\nq would be close to 69\u0003 and 81\u0003 (as dip angle I is given by\ntan I = 2 tan L). In practice, on the dayside the magneto-\nsphere is compressed so that q tends to be greater than\nexpected for a dipole, and on the nightside it is stretched\ninto a magnetotail so that q is less than expected.\n[24] The first signatures of interest occur shortly after\n0400 UT when q decreases at both spacecraft, indicating\nthe development of a more tail-like magnetic configuration,\nfollowed by an increase of q after 0450 UT. This recovery\ntowards more a more dipolar field structure, a \u2018\u2018dipolariza-\ntion,\u2019\u2019 is a response to substorm onset SB1 and represents a\ndisruption of the cross-tail current that is associated with the\nstretched field geometry and subsequent closure of open flux.\n[25] At \u00030650 UT, perturbations associated with the solar\nwind shock front are observed, mainly an increase in overall\nfield strength as the magnetosphere is compressed, accom-\npanied by a short-lived decrease in q indicating a change to\na more tail-like configuration. The q recovers quickly,\nhowever, presumably as a response to substorm onset SB2\nfollowing the shock arrival. Thereafter q remains relatively\nconstant, slow changes probably reflecting local time var-\niations in the field geometry, until \u00030950 UT when q\ndecreases dramatically over the next 45 min, especially at\nGOES 10 which is nearest midnight. This is perhaps the\nmost important aspect of the geosynchronous orbit obser-\nvations, as it indicates that the tail configuration changes\nlittle during the interval of northward IMF following the\nshock front arrival, but after the southward turning the\nmagnetosphere rapidly becomes more stretched and tail-\nlike, reflecting an increase in open flux in the system and\nthe development of the lobes. Shortly after 1030 UT, q\nincreases once again in response to substorm onset SB3.\n[26] The LANL spacecraft 1991-080, 1994-084, and 97A\nalso orbit at geosynchronous altitude at this time, making\nmeasurements of fluxes of protons and electrons in the\nenergy ranges 50\u2013400 keV and 50\u2013315 keV, respectively\n(data not shown). These satellites are clustered on the\ndayside during the interval of interest, though all are able\nto detect significant increases in particle fluxes in response\nto substorm injections [e.g., Arnoldy and Chan, 1969;\nMcIlwain, 1974] associated with SB1, SB2, and SB3; the\nlast of these is also preceded by a drop-out of fluxes, which\nhas previously been identified as a \u2018\u2018plasma sheet thinning\u2019\u2019\n[Sauvaud and Winckler, 1980] associated with an accumu-\nlation of open flux in the magnetosphere. Most importantly,\nhowever, there is no sign that these spacecraft exit the\nmagnetosphere at any time. In other words, the near sub-\nsolar magnetopause remains outside geosynchronous orbit\nthroughout this interval.\n2.5. High-Altitude Cusp: Polar\n[27] At the same time as recording images of the aurora,\nthe Polar spacecraft is able to make in situ measurements of\nthe plasma and magnetic field environment in the vicinity\nof the high-altitude cusp. In this study we concentrate on\nthe field measurements alone. Figure 10 shows the total\nmagnetic field magnitude measured by the Polar Magnetic\nField Experiment (MFE) for the time interval 0400\u2013\n1230 UT (Figure 10a, thick solid curve) along with the\nthree GSM components (Figures 10b\u201310d). Superimposed\nas the thin curve is the Tsyganenko magnetic field model\n[Tsyganenko, 1995] estimation of the field components at\nthe location of Polar; note the rapid increase in overall field\nstrength after 1000 UT as the spacecraft moves to lower\naltitudes. In general, a good correspondence is found\nbetween the model and the observations, except during\nthe interval between the vertical dashed lines (0655\u2013\n0910 UT), from the arrival of the shock front and over\nthe subsequent 2 hours. Here, marked departures from the\nmodel predictions are found, most notably perhaps the\nreversal of the sense of Bz, from negative to positive. This\nis difficult to understand if the spacecraft remains within the\nmagnetosphere, as the field should point into the northern\nhemisphere. It seems reasonable to suggest then that the\nmagnetopause is so compressed following the increase in\nsolar wind dynamic pressure that Polar finds itself in the\nmagnetosheath at this time. The dotted curves in Figure 10\nFigure 9. (a\u2013b) Magnetic field measurements at geosyn-\nchronous orbit observed by GOES-8 and -10. Vertical\ndashed lines indicate the time at which each satellite crosses\nthe midnight meridian. (c) The angle made by the field in\nthe meridional plane.\nA04220 MILAN ET AL.: OPEN FLUX CONTENT OF THE MAGNETOTAIL\n9 of 16\nA04220\nshow the Wind IMF observations, suitably time-lagged to\nthe magnetosphere (note different scale). A very close match\nis found with the Polar observations during the dashed\ninterval, confirming that this is indeed the case. Lockwood\net al. [2001] examined the plasma environment of Polar\nduring this interval and suggested that the observation of\nalpha particles and high-charge oxygen was also consistent\nwith Polar being located in the magnetosheath at this time.\nThe ratio of field strengths between Polar and Wind is close\nto 5, indicating that the magnetosheath field is compressed\nby this factor relative to the solar wind at this location, in a\nsimilar manner to the field ratio of 1.5 found down-tail at\nIMP-8 (see section 2.3). Shortly after 0900 UT the gradual\ndecline in solar wind dynamic pressure, coupled with the\ndecrease in altitude of Polar, results in a reentry of the\nmagnetosphere. There are also possible transient reentries\nat 0805 and 0835 UT. These observations show that near\nX \u0001 0 RE the magnetosphere is compressed to within a\nradial distance (Y2 + Z2)1\/2 \u0001 8 RE following the solar wind\nshock, well within the location predicted by the Shue et al.\n[1998] model.\n3. Discussion\n[28] Observations from a variety of spacecraft indicate\nthat following a step in solar wind dynamic pressure to\nmore than 10 nPa the magnetosphere becomes highly\ncompressed, such that the Polar and IMP-8 spacecraft enter\nthe magnetosheath. This indicates that the radius (actually,\nthe cylindrical distance from the Sun-Earth line) of the\nmagnetosphere and magnetotail near X \u0001 0 and \u000225 RE is\nless than 8 and 20 RE, respectively. While the latter is\nconsistent with the predicted location of the magnetopause\nin the Shue et al. [1998] model, the former is not, indicating\na much smaller magnetosphere than expected. Geosynchro-\nnous orbit measurements from the LANL spacecraft show,\nhowever, that the subsolar magnetopause remains upstream\nof X \u0001 6.6 RE throughout the interval. Simultaneous\nobservations of the northern hemisphere auroral dynamics\nshow that a large substorm triggered by the shock arrival\ncloses most of the open flux previously contained within the\npolar cap, suggesting a significant deflation of the magneto-\ntail lobes. The IMF turns northwards at this time, so no\nreinflation of the lobes is expected until a southward turning\nof the IMF some 3 hours later. This might explain why\nIMP-8 does not reenter the magnetosphere until some time\nafter the southward turning, despite a slackening of the solar\nwind dynamic pressure prior to this. In this section we\ndetermine changes in the open flux content of the magne-\ntosphere and from these estimate the dimensions of the\nmagnetotail.\n3.1. Polar Cap Area\n[29] Using the procedure described by Milan et al.\n[2003], we estimate the location of the open\/closed field\nline boundary (OCB) at all local times from the Polar UVI,\nFAST, and SuperDARN observations; for brevity the latter\nare not presented in this paper, see instead Milan et al.\n[2000a, 2000b]. It is then a straightforward matter to\nintegrate the radial component of the magnetic field\n(assumed dipolar) within this region to give the total open\nflux through the polar cap, FPC. Figure 11a shows the time\nseries of FPC so determined. For simplicity, measurements\nare made only at key stages in the auroral evolution, marked\nby filled or open circles numbered 1\u201312, and FPC is\ninterpolated in between. For interest, we also mark the\napproximate voltages associated with the changes in flux,\nthe difference between the day and nightside reconnection\nrates (cf. Milan et al. [2003], and see section 3.4). We note\nthat the variation in FPC can be recognized in the motion of\nthe main regions of luminosity shown in Figures 4a\u20134c. The\nkey stages in the auroral development are described below.\n[30] (1) At the start of the interval the auroral oval appears\nrather quiescent, similar to that shown in Figure 5a. FPC is\nfound to be close to 0.55 GWb. (2) In the subsequent hour\nIMF Bz is small but negative (Figure 11b) and the auroral\nluminosity gradually moves to lower latitude as low-latitude\nreconnection at the magnetopause increases FPC to\n0.7 GWb. Stage 2 corresponds to the onset of the first\nsubstorm, SB1. (3) The onset of reconnection in the\nmagnetotail associated with SB1 causes FPC to decrease\nuntil stage 3, corresponding to the FAST overpass indicated\nin Figure 5a, and beyond until (4) just prior to the arrival\nof the solar wind shock; at this time FPC \u0001 0.45 GWb.\nThe IMF is directed slightly northwards during most of\nthis interval and no dayside low-latitude reconnection\nis expected, except for the last half hour, during which\ntime there is a slight increase in FPC to 0.5 GWb\n(Figure 5b).\nFigure 10. (a\u2013d) Total magnetic field, and field compo-\nnents, measured at Polar (thick solid curves) and at Wind\n(dotted curves). Thin solid curves indicate predictions for\nthe Polar observations from the T95 model. Vertical dashed\nlines indicate the interval during which significant depar-\ntures from model expectation are observed. An inset figure\nshows the orbit of Polar in the X-Z plane (see also Figure 2).\nA04220 MILAN ET AL.: OPEN FLUX CONTENT OF THE MAGNETOTAIL\n10 of 16\nA04220\n[31] (5) After the solar wind shock front arrives and\nsubstorm break-up SB2 commences, there is a rapid de-\ncrease in FPC to as little as 0.2 GWb by 0730 UT (7) (see\nFigures 5c\u20135e). After this time it becomes more difficult to\ndetermine the size of the polar cap as the auroral luminosity\nat high latitudes fades, even though we know that much of\nthis region is closed (Figures 5f\u20135i). At this point we must\nmake some assumptions, and for this reason 8 and 9 are\nrepresented by open circles to indicate some uncertainty in\nFPC. As the IMF is directed strongly northward from\n0655 UT until the southward turning at 0950 UT, we\nassume that no additional opening of flux has taken place\nuntil (8), i.e., that FPC \u0001 0.2 GWb at this time. There is then\na rapid equatorward motion of the auroral oval, indicating\nstrong coupling with the IMF and the addition of significant\namounts of open flux to the system.\n[32] (9) The onset of substorm SB3 and the closure of\nflux in the magnetotail marks a slowing of the increase\nin flux within the polar cap. It is not stopped however, as\nopen flux is continually being added on the dayside, as the\nIMF remains southwards. From Figure 5j it is clear that\nalthough the region of low luminosity within the auroral\noval is very extended at this time, not all of this region maps\nto open flux. To estimate how much of this flux is open, we\nassume that at stage 8 FPC \u0001 0.2 GWb but that the total flux\n(open and closed) represented by the dim portion within the\nauroral oval at this time is estimated at close to 0.5 GWb\n(see for instance Figure 5i). The amount of closed flux at\nthese high latitudes is then close to 0.3 GWb. During the\nsubsequent expansion of the polar cap, we assume that this\namount of dim closed flux remains constant until some time\nafter the onset of SB3 (note the presence of transpolar arcs\neven after the southward turning of the IMF, section 2.2).\nHence at stage 9 the amount of open flux is given by the\nflux enclosed by the bright auroral oval (0.95 GWb) minus\nthis closed region, such that FPC \u0001 0.65 GWb.\n[33] By stage 10, the polar cap has reached its maximum\nextent, FPC \u0001 0.95 GWb. At this time we assume that the\nreconfiguration of the magnetosphere by the substorm has\nresulted in all flux within the auroral oval being open, as\nconfirmed by the FAST overpass shown in Figure 5l. By this\ntime, the IMF is no longer strongly southward so dayside\nreconnection effectively ceases. Continued nightside recon-\nnection associated with SB3 leads to a considerable reduction\nin open flux until stage 11, at which point FPC \u0001 0.45 GWb.\nThe IMF turns southward once again, and there is an increase\nin FPC to almost 0.6 GWb by stage 12, which represents the\nlast usable images from Polar UVI.\n[34] In summary, the open flux content varies by almost a\nfactor of 5 during the interval of interest. As the total flux\nthrough each hemisphere of the Earth is close to 8 GWb, we\nestimate that at auroral stage 7 only 2.5% of the flux is\nopen, whereas at stage 10 when the polar cap is at its\ngreatest extent, this proportion has risen to 12%. Substorm\nSB2 is of interest as this is triggered by the arrival of a solar\nwind shock. Petrinec and Russell [1996] report three shock-\ntriggered substorms during which the approximate amount\nof open flux closed is 0.4\u20130.5 GWb, whereas SB2 closes\nonly 0.3 GWb. The discrepancy between these figures may\nbe due to the small quantity of open flux remaining in the\nmagnetosphere after SB2, 0.2 GWb, suggesting that it may\nbe difficult to close all the open flux in the system. In the\nnext section, we employ FPC to estimate the dimensions of\nthe magnetotail and compare this to the IMP-8 observations.\n3.2. Cross-Sectional Area of the Magnetotail\n[35] In cross section the magnetotail comprises two back-\nto-back D-shaped regions of open flux, the northern and\nsouthern lobes, sandwiching in between the plasma sheet,\nwhich is located on closed field lines earthward of the tail\nreconnection site and on \u2018\u2018disconnected\u2019\u2019 IMF field lines\nFigure 11. (a) An estimate of the open flux content of the\nmagnetosphere from observations of the northern polar\nionosphere. (b) The simultaneous IMF Bz observations from\nWind. (c) An estimate of the magnetotail lobe magnetic\nfield strength from the relationship with upstream solar\nwind dynamic pressure illustrated in Figure 7. (d) The\ncorresponding cross-section area of each of the magnetotail\nlobes. (e) The expected radial dimension of the magnetotail\n(solid curve), the prediction of the Shue et al. [1998] model,\nand the radial position of IMP-8, shown thick when the\nspacecraft is within the magnetotail.\nA04220 MILAN ET AL.: OPEN FLUX CONTENT OF THE MAGNETOTAIL\n11 of 16\nA04220\ntailward of it (Figure 1). We assume that the overall cross-\nsectional area of the tail is twice that represented by an\nindividual lobe, plus the cross-sectional area of the plasma\nsheet. The northern and southern lobes both contain an\nequal amount of flux and each map directly to the northern\nand southern ionospheric polar caps, respectively. If it is\nassumed that a negligible amount of flux crosses the\nmagnetopause earthwards of IMP-8, we can equate the flux\nin each lobe at X \u0001 \u000225 RE to FPC determined from the\nionospheric observations. The cross-sectional area of each\nlobe should then be\nAlobe \u00bc FPC\nBlobe\n; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere Blobe is the magnetic field strength within the lobes.\nIMP-8 cannot provide a continuous measure of Blobe as the\nspacecraft moves in and out of the magnetosphere.\nHowever, in section 2.3 we noted that a relationship\nappeared to exist between solar wind dynamic pressure and\nmagnetic pressure within the lobe, with a constant of\nproportionality close to 0.1 (see Figure 8a). If such a\nrelationship can be shown to be reliable, then upstream\nWind observations can be employed to estimate Blobe, even\nwhen IMP-8 is not in the lobe.\n[36] To this end, we turn to the full stress balance between\nthe lobe magnetic pressure and the sum of solar wind\ndynamic, static and magnetic pressures (as, for example,\nPetrinec and Russell [1996], though here we have intro-\nduced a factor of 2 in the second term to properly account\nfor specular reflection of particles from the magnetopause,\nnot just incidence):\nB2lobe\n2m0\n\u00bc 2Pdyn cos2 x\u00fe NSWkB Te \u00fe Ti\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe B\n2\nIMF\n2m0\n; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere kB and m0 have their usual meanings. In equation (2)\nwe assume that the gas or static pressure in the lobe is\nnegligible when compared with the magnetic pressure.\nThen, using measurements of Blobe from IMP-8 when it is\nwithin the magnetotail, equation (2) can be used to estimate\nx, from which the flaring of the tail can be found. In\nFigure 8b we show x \u0002 90\u0003 (diamonds), to compare with\nthe field angle y (crosses), which we used as a proxy for the\nmagnetotail flare (note that the scales have been displaced\nby 10\u0003 for clarity, and horizontal dotted curves represent\nangles of 10\u0003). A close match is found between these two\nestimates of the tail flare, with even variations with\nsubstorm phase being reproduced.\n[37] Although a gratifying prediction of the flaring\nangle can be found, this is possible only when we have\na knowledge of Blobe. However, we want to use equation\n(2) to estimate Blobe, even in the absence of actual tail\nmeasurements. In this case we must use a fixed value of\nx. We pick a value of x = 79\u0003, corresponding to an 11\u0003\nangle of flare, the approximate mean of y. Then Figure 8c\nshows the predicted value of Blobe, along with the\nmeasurements of IMP-8, indicating a close correspon-\ndence when IMP-8 is within the magnetotail. We also\nshow the predictions for x = 79\u0003 \u00b1 2.5\u0003 (dots) to indicate\nhow changes of flare with substorm phase might affect\nour estimates.\n[38] This variation in Blobe is reproduced, somewhat\nsmoothed, in Figure 11c. Figure 11d then shows the\nestimated cross-sectional area of an individual lobe, found\nfrom equation (1). Following Fairfield [1986], we estimate\nthe radius of the tail Rtail from\npR2tail \u00bc 2Alobe \u00fe 4RtailZPS ; \u00f03\u00de\nwhich equates the total cross-sectional area of the tail (left-\nhand side (LHS)) with that of the two lobes and a rectangular\nplasma sheet of half-thickness ZPS (RHS), as indicated in\nFigure 1. Fairfield assumed that ZPS \u0001 4 and 3 RE at down-\ntail distances of X \u0001 \u000260 and \u0002200 RE. We use a value of\nZPS \u0001 5 RE at X \u0001 \u000225 RE, though our results are not\nparticularly sensitive to this parameter. From equation (3) it\nis trivial to find the expected magnetotail radius, which is\nshown in Figure 11e, along with the estimate from Shue et al.\n[1998]. Superimposed is the radial location of IMP-8, shown\nbold when the spacecraft is located within the magnetotail\n(see also Figure 7). There appears to be an excellent\ncorrelation between changes in our estimate of the radial\ndimension of the magnetotail and intervals when the\nspacecraft is within or without the magnetopause boundary.\n[39] Typical dimensions of the magnetosphere might be\n15 and 20\u201325 RE at X = 0 and \u000225 RE, respectively.\nHowever, our calculations show that, at its most compressed\nand deflated, the radial dimension of the magnetotail might\nbe as small as 12 or 13 RE at X \u0001 \u000225 RE; at the same time,\nsection 2.5 shows that the magnetospheric radius near X \u0001 0\nis 8 RE or less. We note in passing that the increase in radial\ndimension by approximately 4\u20135 RE in 25 RE of down-tail\ndistance is consistent with our estimate of the magnetotail\nflaring angle of \u000311\u0003 (i.e., radius at X \u0001 \u000225 RE is\napproximately 8 + 25 tan 11\u0003 RE).\n[40] In the next section we turn to a comparison between\nour estimate Rtail and that of the Shue model. However,\nbefore this, we briefly examine our assumption that the\namount of flux in the lobe at the location of IMP-8 is equal\nto the flux through the polar cap, or in other words, that no\nopen flux crosses the tail magnetopause sunwards of IMP-8.\nThis is certainly true when no dayside reconnection has\noccurred in the recent past. However, if reconnection is\nongoing, then newly opened flux tubes will take some time\nto propagate from the reconnection site into the tail, carried\nby the flow of the magnetosheath. At a solar wind speed of\n600 km s\u00021, propagation from the sub-solar magnetopause\nto IMP-8 (approximately 35 RE) will take 5 or 6 min. If\nthe reconnection rate is 100 kV, then this represents 3.5 \b\n107 Wb of open flux crossing the magnetopause sunwards of\nIMP-8, which can be a sizable fraction (\u000310%) of the open\nflux in the magnetosphere. In other words, the size of the\nmagnetotail will lag behind changes observed in the polar\ncap area but only by a few minutes. Consequently, on the\ntimescales involved in the present study we can assume that\nflux is transported almost instantly to the location of IMP-8.\nIn section 3.4 we will use a variation of this argument to\ndetermine the instantaneous length of the magnetotail.\n3.3. Comparison With Shue et al. [1998]\n[41] The model of Shue et al. [1998] is based upon\nobservations of magnetopause crossings by many spacecraft\nover a broad range of X. These have been correlated with\nA04220 MILAN ET AL.: OPEN FLUX CONTENT OF THE MAGNETOTAIL\n12 of 16\nA04220\nupstream measurements of Pdyn and IMF Bz to give an\nempirically determined formula for the shape of the mag-\nnetopause. The model derives two main quantities from Pdyn\nand Bz which in turn determine the shape of the magneto-\npause. These are r0, the subsolar stand-off distance, and a,\nwhich determines the flaring of the magnetosphere. The first\nterm recognizes that enhanced solar wind dynamic pressure\ncompresses the magnetosphere, especially on the dayside.\nThe model is not explicitly parameterized by the open flux\ncontent of the magnetosphere, as this is difficult to quantify\non a routine basis. However, the dependence of the flaring\nparameter a on Bz implicitly recognizes that the open flux\ncontent is on average greater when the IMF is directed\nsouthward; hence the magnetotail is inflated and so the\ndegree of flaring is larger than during northwards directed\nIMF. The effects of varying both Pdyn and Bz on the model\nprediction can be seen in Figure 11e. For instance, when\nPdyn increases in a stepwise manner at 0655 UT, RShue\ndecreases markedly. As Bz is also positive at this time, RShue\nis especially small. At 0950 UT, when Bz becomes negative,\nalthough Pdyn does not change significantly at this time,\nRShue increases to reflect an expected accumulation of open\nflux in the magnetotail. However, we know that the quantity\nof open flux is not so directly linked to the orientation of the\nIMF, and this parameterization is overly simplistic; the\nquantity of open flux in the magnetosphere depends cru-\ncially on the past history of dayside and nightside recon-\nnection. Thus the magnetosphere does not inflate to the size\npredicted by RShue until about 1030 UT and continues to\ngrow beyond this as FPC continues to increase. This can\nalso be seen immediately following the shock arrival, when\nour prediction Rtail steps inward at the pressure increase but\nthen continues to reduce in size as flux is closed by SB2\nover the following 30 min or so. The Shue model, then,\nindicates the size the magnetosphere would have if it\ncontained a \u2018\u2018typical\u2019\u2019 amount of flux for the upstream\nIMF Bz component, and which is compressed to an average\nBlobe for the given Pdyn. At times when the open flux\ncontent of the magnetosphere can be considered typical\n(say 0.6 GWb), the correspondence between Rtail and RShue\nis good, for example near 0500, 0600, and 1030 UT. If the\nflux content is greater than or less than this value, however,\nthe magnetosphere can become considerably larger or\nsmaller than predicted. In our case, the Shue model is\nunable to take into account the combined effect of a\nsimultaneously compressed and deflated tail.\n[42] At the subsolar point the Shue model predicts a\nmagnetopause standoff distance of 8 RE when the magne-\ntosphere is at its most compressed (see Figure 1). Although\nthe magnetotail is considerably more compressed than\npredicted at this time, this subsolar prediction is certainly\nconsistent with our observation that the magnetopause does\nnot cross geosynchronous orbit at X = 6.6 RE. This is to be\nexpected, as the position of the subsolar magnetopause does\nnot depend on the open flux content of the magnetosphere\nto the same extent as in the tail. It is known, however,\nthat under extreme southward IMF coupling, the dayside\nmagnetopause can become eroded inwards as closed flux is\nopened and peeled antisunward to form the magnetotail\n[e.g., Aubry et al., 1970; Holzer and Slavin, 1978]. Con-\nversely, if the open flux content of the magnetosphere is\nlow, then the subsolar standoff distance may even be greater\nthan the Shue prediction. Overall, during our interval, this\nwould result in a relatively pointed and low cross-section\nmagnetosphere.\n3.4. Length of the Magnetotail\n[43] At the end of section 3.2 we argued that the open\nflux crossing the magnetopause sunward of IMP-8 was\nequal to the dayside reconnection rate integrated over the\ntime taken for field lines to be transported from the subsolar\npoint to the spacecraft location. We can use a similar\nargument to estimate the length of the magnetotail. Previous\nobservations have shown that tail-like features can be\nobserved as far downstream of the Earth as 1000 RE [e.g.,\nCowley, 1991, and references therein] and perhaps even\n\u00033000 RE [Intriligator et al., 1979].\n[44] The growth and decay of open flux threading the\npolar cap can be represented by the following expression of\nFaraday\u2019s Law [see Milan et al., 2003, and references\ntherein]:\ndFPC t\u00f0 \u00de\ndt\n\u00bc Fday t\u00f0 \u00de \u0002 Fnight t\u00f0 \u00de; \u00f04\u00de\nwhere Fnight and Fday are the voltages associated with\nreconnection in the magnetotail and at the low-latitude\nmagnetopause. In other words, the expansion or contraction\nof the polar cap, as represented in Figure 11a, is controlled\nby the competition between the instantaneous creation and\ndestruction of open flux. Following reconnection on the\ndayside, newly opened field lines are carried antisunward by\nthe solar wind flow to form the magnetotail. Some time Dt\nafter reconnection, these field lines cross the magnetopause\nand enter the solar wind (points C in Figure 1), reducing the\noverall flux within the magnetotail F, at a down-tail distance\nof x = VSWDt. For simplicity we assume a constant value of\nVSW, thereby neglecting the interaction between faster and\nslower elements within the solar wind, and the consequent\ncompression or rarefraction of the magnetic field. By\nextension of equation (4), and recognizing that dx = VSWdt,\nthis can be represented as\ndF x; t\u00f0 \u00de\ndx\n\u00bc \u0002 1\nVSW\nFday t \u0002 Dt\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc \u0002 1\nVSW\nFday t \u0002 x\nVSW\n\u0001 \u0002\n: \u00f05\u00de\nAt the earthward end of the tail, x = 0, the amount of open\nflux F(x = 0, t) is just that threading the polar cap, FPC(t).\nBy integration, the flux remaining in the tail at any\nparticular x and t is given by\nF x; t\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc FPC t\u00f0 \u00de \u0002 1\nVSW\nZx\n0\nFday t \u0002 x\nVSW\n\u0001 \u0002\ndx: \u00f06\u00de\nThe tail terminates at x = Ltail, such that F(x, t) = 0, or in\nother words\nZLtail\n0\nFday t \u0002 x\nVSW\n\u0001 \u0002\ndx \u00bc VSWFPC t\u00f0 \u00de: \u00f07\u00de\nThus the length of the magnetotail, and the profile of open\nflux within it, can be found from a knowledge of the present\nsize of the polar cap and the past history of dayside\nreconnection. The former is found from our ionospheric\nA04220 MILAN ET AL.: OPEN FLUX CONTENT OF THE MAGNETOTAIL\n13 of 16\nA04220\nobservations and is reproduced in Figure 12a, and the latter\nwe estimate from upstream observations of the solar wind\nelectric field ESW = \u0002VSWBz, presented in Figure 12b. We\nassume that the dayside reconnection rate (reconnection\nvoltage) can be found by applying this electric field across a\nconstant portion of the dayside magnetopause LMP, and that\nreconnection only takes place if the IMF is directed\nsouthwards, Bz < 0, such that\nFday \u00bc\nLMPESW\n0\n9=\n;\nBz < 0\nBz < 0\n; \u00f08\u00de\npresented in Figure 12c [see also, e.g., Holzer and Slavin,\n1979]. Then, from equation (4), the rate of expansion of the\npolar cap should be equal to Fday when no nightside\nreconnection is taking place, Fnight = 0, which should be the\ncase between auroral stages 1\u20132, 4\u20135, 7\u20139, and 11\u201312, as\ndefined in section 3.1 (see Figures 11a and 12a). At these\ntimes we have superimposed the expected growth in FPC\nfrom equations (4) and (8); this close match between\nprediction and observation is found for LMP = 5 RE (in good\nagreement with Holzer and Slavin [1979]). We can use this\nrelationship to find Fday at all times. Then, coupled with our\nmeasurements of FPC, and assuming a constant solar wind\nspeed of 600 km s\u00021, we can use equations (6) and (7) to\nfind the instantaneous length of the magnetotail and the\nprofile of the open flux within it. These are shown in\nFigure 12d, the grey scale indicating the amount of open\nflux remaining in each magnetotail lobe as a function of\ndown-tail distance. The point at which the open flux goes to\nzero is marked by the solid curve.\n[45] Our calculations suggest that during the 8 hours\npresented the magnetotail varies in length between almost\n4000 RE and as little as 400 RE. Somewhat counter-\nintuitively, the magnetotail is at its shortest just following\nthe time that the polar cap is at its maximum size. Indeed,\nthe tail shortens dramatically during periods of rapid tail\nreconnection, that is after each substorm onset. During\nperiods of mild or even zero growth of the polar cap,\nprovided no nightside reconnection occurs, the magnetotail\ncontinues to grow in length at the solar wind speed. Three\nrepresentative profiles of the open flux content of the\nmagnetotail are shown in Figure 12e, from 0500, 0900,\nand 1100 UT, marked by vertical dashed lines in Figure 12d.\nAt 0500 UT, the polar cap contains a typical amount of open\nflux, of order 0.6 GWb, and this determines the near-Earth\nopen flux content of the tail. The tail then decreases\ngradually in open flux along its length, reflecting the fact\nthat over the preceding few hours the dayside reconnection\nrate has been low and relatively steady (not shown). At\n0900 UT, however, the tail is much shorter and contains less\nopen flux, as the polar cap is smaller and nightside recon-\nnection associated with SB2 has recently truncated the tail.\nFinally, at 1100 UT the polar cap is large and the open flux\ncontent of the near-Earth tail mirrors this; however, the flux\ncontent drops dramatically in the first 400 RE of its length as\nthis open flux was all created recently in the polar cap\nexpansion after 1000 UT, and these field lines have not\nexisted for a sufficient time to be stretched to greater\nlengths. Beyond X = \u0002400 RE, the remaining open flux is\nthat which predates the last polar cap expansion. This older,\nextended tail is rapidly being eroded by on-going nightside\nreconnection associated with SB3; continuing reconnection\nwill see the disappearance of this fossil tail, which indeed\noccurs after 1115 UT.\n[46] We note at this point the caveat that our model shows\nthe length of that portion of the magnetotail which contains\nopen flux. Beyond this point all field lines are entirely\ndisconnected from the Earth. However, as suggested by\nCowley [1991], there will be a remnant tail which contains\nrecently disconnected field lines that are still highly kinked\nand stretch back towards the tail reconnection site (D in\nFigure 1). These field lines will rapidly contract along the\nlength of the tail, though as they do so their down-tail ends\ncontinue to move to ever greater distances with the solar\nwind flow. Thus if the speed of retraction of the field lines is\nFigure 12.

Conclusions\n[47] We have demonstrated a direct link between the\nradial dimension of the magnetotail and the amount of open\nflux in the magnetosphere. Following a large step in solar\nwind dynamic pressure, the magnetosphere becomes highly\ncompressed. Coupled with the closure of most of the open\nflux in the system in response to this compression, we\npredict that the magnetotail radius at X \u0001 \u000225 RE becomes\nas small as 12 RE. Despite a gradual slackening of the solar\nwind pressure, the magnetotail radius does not recover to\nmore typical dimensions until over 3 hours later, approxi-\nmately 40 min after a southward turning of the IMF. These\n40 min are interpreted as the time scale necessary to\nreplenish the magnetosphere with open flux and hence\nreinflate the magnetotail, through the action of low-latitude\nmagnetopause reconnection.\n[48] In addition we find that the magnetic field strength\nwithin the magnetotail lobes depends to first order on the\nupstream solar wind dynamic pressure. This is understood\nas the compression of the magnetotail to the point that the\ninternal magnetic pressure balances the normal stress\nexerted by the solar wind flow. The magnetic pressure is\nfound to be approximately one tenth of the solar wind\ndynamic pressure, reflecting pressure variations within the\nmagnetosheath and the angle of attack of the flow against\nthe flared magnetopause.\n[49] Typically, the average location of the polar cap\nboundary, estimated from the latitude of the auroral oval,\nsuggests that some 7 or 8% of the Earth\u2019s magnetic flux is\nopen to the solar wind. During the interval of study, this\nreduces to just 2.5%, indicating a nearly closed magneto-\nsphere. Despite this, in the subsequent 3 hours the auroral\noval assumes a quiescent but typical appearance, with a\nnightside poleward boundary near a latitude of 70\u0003, sug-\ngesting an open polar cap of apparently significant size.\nThis indicates that care must be taken in using auroral\nobservations to determine the amount of open flux in the\nmagnetosphere. On the other hand, with this caveat under-\nstood, auroral observations can give important information\nregarding the large-scale configuration of the magneto-\nsphere and magnetotail. Our study also demonstrates the\npotential limitations of magnetopause models which assume\nthat the instantaneous open flux content of the magneto-\nsphere depends solely on the immediate upstream solar\nwind and IMF conditions. Finally, our model of magnetotail\nlength and flux content shows the tail to be a highly\ndynamic structure, with dramatic changes in open flux\ncontent with time and along its length, reflecting the past\nhistory of dayside and nightside reconnection.\n[50] Acknowledgments.
