The emissive and electrical properties of devices with different numbers of \nnanocrystal layers were studied. The improved structural homogeneity of the nanocrystal multilayer \nallowed for stable and repeatable current- and electroluminescence-voltage characteristics. These \nindicate that both current and electroluminescence are electric-field dependent. Devices were operated \nunder ambient conditions and a clear red-light was detected. The best-performing device shows a peak \nexternal efficiency of 0.51% and was measured at 0.35mA\/cm2 and 3.3V.  \n 2\nA recent approach to the fabrication of electroluminescent devices has emerged from the development of \ncolloidal semiconductor nanocrystalline quantum dots - here also termed nanocrystals or nanoparticles. \nSemiconductor nanocrystals are inorganic nanoparticles that can be synthesized in organic solvents1 or \nwater2 and are surrounded by an organic capping layer. The optical and electronic properties are determined \nby the quantum confinement effect3. As their size is reduced below the bulk Bohr exciton diameter, the color \nof emission can be tuned by varying the size of the nanocrystals while the narrow size distribution allows for \nphotoluminescence peaks with full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of 25-35nm4.  \n \nThe use of semiconductor nanocrystals as a light-emitting material has been investigated by several groups \nworldwide. To date, a number of different structures was produced which combine different organic materials and \nnarrow-band luminescent nanocrystals into light-emitting diodes (LEDs) 5-16. The emissive properties depend on \nthe type of colloidal nanoparticles used as well as on the additional layers (typically, organic polymers) inserted to \npromote the electrons and holes injection and transport.  \n \nExternal efficiencies as high as 1.1% have been achieved with hybrid organic\/inorganic devices employing \nCdSe(ZnS) core\/shell semiconductor nanoparticles as the emissive material11. However, in these structures the \nnanocrystals do not play an active role in the charge transport and the electrical conduction is determined by the \npolymer layers. Alternatively, Gao et al.13 reported a device based on self-assembled CdTe nanocrystals, in which \nthe conduction mechanisms depended on the nanocrystals` electrical properties and arrangement. The \nnanocrystals were deposited through a layer-by-layer technique. Polyethyleneimine (PEI) and poly-\n(diallyldimethylammonium) (PDDA) were used to functionalize the substrate and acted exclusively as embedding \ndielectric matrix for the quantum-dots. The authors propose a field-driven current while the electroluminescence \ndependency with voltage\/field is not discussed. Devices were fabricated using nanocrystals of different sizes. The \nelectroluminescence turn-on spread between 2.5 and 3.5V with the size. This was attributed to a lower injection \nefficiency of electrons for smaller particles due to the shift of the electron energy levels to higher values as the \nparticle size is decreased. External quantum efficiencies up to 0.1% were achieved. \n \nHere we report results pertaining to the development of a red-emitting electroluminescent device based on \nthiol-capped CdTe nanocrystals characterized to have 30-40% photoluminescence quantum yield17. The device \n 3\nstructure consists of an emissive CdTe nanocrystal multilayer sandwiched between indium-tin-oxide and a \nthermally evaporated aluminum electrode. To study the emissive and electrical properties of the nanocrystal \nmultilayer, the conductive polymers used in hybrid polymer\/nanocrystal LEDs were eliminated, as in reference13. \nResults show that the quality and uniformity of the emissive multilayer was crucial to achieve better efficiencies \nwhile the electrical characterization proves that current and electroluminescence are electric-field dependent. \nCdTe nanocrystals synthesized in aqueous solution represent a natural core-shell system2,17,18. The \ninorganic core is surrounded by a ligand shell which creates a surface charge on the nanocrystals so that they \ncan be deposited by the self-assembly method to build nanoparticle thin-films19,20.  \nMultilayers were manufactured using the layer-by-layer technique under standard laboratory conditions. As \nreported previously in reference21, the self-assembly process was simplified by using only one polyelectrolyte \u2013 \nnamely, PDDA, to functionalize the substrate in the adsorption process. This was beneficial in terms of the \noverall uniformity and smoothness of the emissive multilayer together with good reproducibility of the film \nthickness and quality. The analysis of the device cross-section allowed estimating that each PDDA\/CdTe bi-\nlayer is around 3nm in accordance with the mean size of the CdTe nanocrystals used, as derived from their \nabsorption spectra. \n \nThe HRTEM picture of a 5 PDDA\/nanocrystal bi-layers deposited layer-by-layer is shown in figure 1. \nX-ray reflectivity measurements were used to determine the density of nanoparticles. The results gave \ndensity figures of 2.3-2.6g\/cm3. Using the density of CdTe (6.2g\/cm3) and PDDA (1.04g\/cm3) the filling \nfactor for CdTe nanoparticles was derived and is of ~27%. From this result and assuming spherical particles, \na simple 3D computer model gave a mean inter-particle distance of 2\u20133\u00c5 and 2-D cross-sections consistent \nwith the TEM analysis of figure 1.  \n \nA number of samples were produced consisting of 30, 40 and 50 bi-layers. The current-voltage \ncharacteristics and the devices light output were measured in normal laboratory conditions (i.e., devices were \nnot sealed or packaged) using a Keithley 6517 electrometer operated as source-meter and a silicon \nphotodiode (OPT-301 from Texas Instruments).  \n \n 4\nFigure 2 shows current-voltage characteristics for several devices made of 30, 40 and 50 bi-layers. The \ncurves appear distributed in voltage according to the number of layers that determine the thickness of the \nmultilayer. Once plotted versus the electric field (see figure 3), curves corresponding to different number of \nlayers are mixed together, and group within a narrow field range \u2013 that is between 2\u00d7107 to 3\u00d7107V\/m. This \nclearly indicates an electric-field dependency. The narrow spread of fields is due to variations between \nsamples, caused by interfacial effects \u2013 such as, localized thermal damages, oxidation or contaminants, \nintroduced during manufacturing between electrodes and nanocrystal multilayer. \n \nAll devices had a 4mm2 emissive area. Samples showed stable currents and the light output was recorded \nat operational current densities in the range of 100\u03bcA\/cm2 - two orders of magnitude lower than the figures \nreported in13. The lower levels and stability of currents are due to the improved uniformity and homogeneity \nof the nanocrystal multilayers. This contributes to reduce the leakage current through structural defects and \npin-holes, and to stabilize the device against localized high-field areas prone to electrical breakdowns. \n \nThe log-log plot of the electroluminescence (expressed in nW) versus the current for the same set of \ndevices is reported in the inset of figure 3. As can be observed, the electroluminescence is roughly \nproportional to the squared current indicating that also the electroluminescence is field-dependent. \n \nThe efficiency figures for all the devices were compared. The best efficiencies were recorded for the 30 \nbi-layer devices while as the number of layers increases, higher voltages are required for light emission \nlowering the efficiency figures. For the 30-bilayer devices, a maximum radiant power of 141nW was \nmeasured at current densities of 350\u03bcA\/cm2 (I\u224814.05\u03bcA) and 3.3V. The insets (a) and (b) show the emission \nspectrum centered at 630nm and the device operated on a laboratory bench - emitting a clear red light. \nAssuming monochromatic emission, the maximum radiant power corresponds to an external quantum \nefficiency of 0.51% and to luminous efficiencies of 0.8lm\/W and 0.4cd\/A (see Figure 4), the brightness \npeaks at 1.42cd\/m2. This represents a five-fold improvement with respect to reference13.  \n \nIn summary, the structural improvement of the nanoparticle multilayer helped removing leakage currents \nand obtaining repeatable current-voltage characteristics. Under these conditions, it was derived that the \n 5\ncurrent is field-dependent as well as the electroluminescence, which is proportional to the squared current. It \nis believed that the efficiency of these devices is limited by the device structure and nanoparticle \nengineering. Through improving the proportion of light emitted from the device by inserting functional \nlayers to favor carrier injection or by increased particle efficiency a significant improvement in the device \nperformance is anticipated to be achieved. \n \nAcknowledgments \nThe authors would like to acknowledge Dr. Alexey Shavel for assisting with the synthesis of CdTe \nnanocrystals, Dr. Sergio Lozano-Perez at Oxford University for the TEM analysis and Dr. Joachim F. \nWoitok, PANalytical (The Netherlands) for the small-angle X-ray investigation. \n 6\nReferences \n1 C.

Current-voltage characteristics of 30, 40 and 50 bi-layers devices. The curves span regularly from \nlower to higher voltages in accordance to the number of layers; this suggests a field-dependency of the \ncurrent, as the number of layers determines the thickness of the emissive layer. The small change in switch-\non voltage for each sub-set of samples is attributed to variations at the multilayer-electrode interface.  \n \nFigure 3. Current density versus electric-field for 30, 40 and 50 bi-layer devices. Curves corresponding to \ndifferent number of layers accumulate within a narrow range of field values, confirming a field dependency \nof the current. The inset shows the log-log plot of the electroluminescence (expressed in radiant power) \nversus the current for the same set of devices. As can be seen, the electroluminescence is approximately \nproportional to the squared current. This indicate that the electroluminescence follows the current and \ntherefore it is electric-field dependent. \n \nFigure 4. Efficiency figures for the best performing 30-layer device.
