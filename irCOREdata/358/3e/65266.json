More than half of households in \nthe region lived below the poverty line and the immediate prospects for \u201edevelopment\u201f \nwere not bright. Drawing on a 25-year longitudinal study of two villages in \nMahasarakham, the paper describes and reflects on how risk and vulnerability have been \nre-shaped during a quarter of a century of profound economic and social change. From \nlargely environmental and local, the pattern of risk and opportunity have become \nincreasingly economic and non-local as external events wash across the shores of rural \nsettlements like Ban Non Tae and Ban Tha Song Korn.  \n \nKeywords: risk, vulnerability, Thailand \nMANAGING RISK AND VULNERABILITY IN ASIA: A 25-YEAR VILLAGE STUDY \nFROM THAILAND \n \nIntroduction: risk, crisis and living \n \nIn the early 1980s, the development prospects of the villages of Ban Non Tae and Ban \nTha Song Korn in the marginal Northeastern region of Thailand were not bright (Figure 1 \n[Map of Thailand and study settlements]. Not only did these villages have to contend with \na capricious climate that made wet rice cultivation a challenge and a struggle, but wider \nevents seemed to be intent on disrupting the Thai government\u201fs attempts to foster \n\u201edevelopment\u201f. Successive oil price rises, a faltering economy, stubbornly high levels of \npoverty, the continuing role of the Communist Party of Thailand, and fears that Vietnam \nmight be expansionist given that country\u201fs foray into Cambodia all contributed to the \nsense that rural Northeast Thailand was going nowhere fast. This is not to say that \nvillagers in the region were destitute; they may have lead meagre lives, they may even \nhave been poor in the way in which the development industry has been intent on \ncounting, describing and categorising the poor; but the inhabitants of Ban Non Tae and \nBan Tha Song Korn were not destitute in the sense of being without food, shelter and \nclothing. Households generally met their subsistence needs and owned the principal \nresource to achieve this \u2013 their land. In many respects, the individuals and families the \nfirst author worked with in the early 1980s were rich, if wealth is considered in cultural, \nsocial and psychological rather than purely economic terms. \n \nSince then, Thailand has made the transition \u2013 on the back of a so-called economic \n\u201emiracle\u201f \u2013 from a low income and developing, agricultural economy, to a middle income, \nmixed economy. The country has also become thoroughly integrated and mobile, with \nfamilies juggling mixed livelihoods in different places. This process of rapid social and \neconomic transformation has not, however, been smooth (Figure 2 [Graph of GDP \ngrowth, poverty and development events]). The Asian financial crisis of 1997-98 led to a \nsharp contraction in the economy and the current global economic malaise may also, in \ntime, be regarded as an equally important historical \u201emoment\u201f.  \n \nIn this paper we are intent on exploring the way in which risk and vulnerability are \nproduced and reproduced over time. More particularly, we are interested in considering \nhow risk and vulnerability are re-shaped in the context of a rapidly integrating, expanding \nand \u201emodernising\u201f economy and society. Have, in short, the changes that have \nreverberated through Thailand also altered the way in which risk and vulnerability are \nproduced, transmitted, experienced and managed at the levels of the village, the \nhousehold and the individual? We will address these issues by drawing on a longitudinal \nstudy of two villages in Northeast Thailand that began in 1982: Ban Non Tae and Ban \nTha Song Korn. To provide some ethnographic substance we will also focus on the \nexperience of one woman, Mrs Achara Wattana, who while not a \u201ecase study\u201f or an \n\u201eexemplar\u201f does, in the specificity of her life experiences, illuminate the issues which we \nalso raise in more general terms.  \n \nUNPICKING RISK AND VULNERABILITY THROUGH A QUARTER OF A CENTURY \nOF CHANGE \n \nIn 1982 when the first author visited Ban Non Tae and Ban Tha Song Korn in the \nNortheastern Thai province of Mahasarakham, it was easy to assume and imagine that \nvillages such as these were, to a significant extent, \u201eworlds unto themselves\u201f. We are not \nsuggesting that there was no mobility or interaction with the world beyond the village, but \nthis was limited, certainly when compared with today. Two of the earliest detailed village \nsurveys carried out in Northeast Thailand are those of Mizuno in 1964 (Fukui 1993) and \nthe CUSRI Village Study of 1969-70 (Amara Pongsapich et al. 1976), both conducted in \nthe province of Khon Kaen which neighbours Mahasarakham. In Mizuno\u201fs survey, 126 \nout of 132 households were agricultural and not one household engaged in extra-village \nwork as a matter of course, although there was some dry-season labour migration to the \nlocal town of Tha Phra to work in a kenaf processing factory. Rice, fruit and vegetables \nwere cultivated for home consumption, livestock were raised, fish and crabs trapped in \nlocal watercourses, most clothes were made at home by the women of the household, \nand many farm implements and household goods were home made as well. This is not to \nsay such economies were un-monetised \u2013 Mizuno writes of villagers having to buy metal \nplough shares, twine to make fishing nets, oil lamps, rubber sandals and, occasionally, a \nbicycle or radio (Fukui 1993: 274). A similar picture of a largely subsistence village \nexistence (rather than \u201eeconomy\u201f) where the spatial bubble of the settlement remained \nlargely unpunctured is also evident in Amara Pongsapich et al.\u201fs study of the late 1960s.  \n \nToday in Thailand, across the country every settlement is thoroughly economically and \nspatially integrated, dependent on resources and opportunities situated beyond the \nboundaries of the village, indeed beyond the sub-district, district and province. While \nAmara and Mizuno describe households that met most of their immediate needs, and \nvillages which were collectively almost self-sufficient in the basics of life, villages are now \nfar from being places where space (settlement), economy (livelihoods) and community \n(society), intersect. The village has \u201edissociated\u201f in multiple ways:1 families are stretched \nacross space and newly mobile populations have led to the emergence of \u201eshadow\u201f \nhouseholds where members may not be co-resident; livelihoods are increasingly \ndelocalised and differentiated; subsistence crops have been partially replaced by cash \ncrops; and community practices such as reciprocal labour exchange (long khaek) have \nlargely disappeared. This should come as of no great surprise. But in commenting on the \nubiquity of such patterns and processes there is a risk that something quite profound may \nbe missed: the dissolution of one of the key building blocks of rural scholarship in the \nGlobal South \u2013 \u201ethe village\u201f. \n \nIn the context of this paper, we are specifically interested in exploring how these \nprocesses of dissociation have re-shaped the way in which risk is transmitted, \nexperienced, managed and ameliorated. To explore this question, we will characterise \nthe nature of risk in two periods separated by a quarter of a century of profound social, \neconomic and environmental change: 1982-83 and 2008-9.  \n \nRisk and vulnerability in 1982-83 \n \nIn the early 1980s, the key risks facing rural households in the Northeast of Thailand \nrelated to the possibility that their subsistence wet rice crop might fail. Fields were rain-\nfed and, with a seasonal and highly variable pattern of rainfall, the chances of individual \ncrop failure were high. Indeed, the core of the subsistence strategy of villagers revolved \naround how to maintain output in such a context and this involved planting a range of rice \nvarieties across different agro-ecological niches, all with a view to maintaining a certain \nminimum level of output, and thus ensuring subsistence (see Grandstaff 1981, 1988, \n1992 and 2009, Rigg 1985, 1986, 1991 and 1993). A \u201esafety first\u201f principle prevailed. As \nthe classic Thai novel of rural life in Northeast Thailand in the 1930s, Luuk Isaan, \nrecounts: \u201cWhen Koon and Jundi and their fathers arrived at the phuyaiban\u2019s [headman\u201fs] \nhouse, the men talked about what they always talked about \u2013 the lack of rain and the lack \nof food in the village\u201d (Kampoon Boontawee 1988: 202). This picture of the risks and \nvulnerabilities facing rural people in a subsistence world resonates with much of the \nclassic literature, exemplified by R.H. Tawney\u201fs well known reflections on China in the \nearly 1930s: \n \n                                                 \n1\n For papers that explore such issues see, for example, Rigg et al 2008 (Thailand), Caces et \nal 1985 (Philippines) and Thompson, 2004 and 2007 (Malaysia). \n \n\u201cThere are districts [in China] in which the position of the rural population is that of a \nman standing permanently up to the neck in water, so that even a ripple is sufficient \nto drown him\u201d (Tawney 1932: 77, see also Scott 1976) \n \nIn addition to household \u201estrategies\u201f being finely tuned to juggle environmental risk \nagainst subsistence necessity, the villages of Ban Non Tae and Ban Tha Song Korn also \nsupported a set of social practices and community arrangements \u2013 a \u201emoral\u201f economy \u2013 \nthat served to provide additional support when household and family subsistence \nstrategies came under pressure. Friends, neighbours and relatives would share work and \nreward, assist during times of crisis, and provide a community safety net which further \nunderpinned individual household strategies (Table 1). The historical literature on Thai \nrural settlements notes that occasionally even these layers of practice, action and \nresponse were inadequate and, then, villagers would stop \u201emanaging\u201f and start \nresponding in emergency mode. This might mean selling a daughter into prostitution, \ndisposing of core assets (in particular, land), banditry \u2013 or simply abandoning the village \n(Table 1).  \n \nRisk and vulnerability in 2008-09 \n \nIn the villages of Ban Non Tae and Ban Tha Song Korn today, many of these approaches \nto managing livelihood risks are either no longer possible, and\/or no longer desirable. \nHouseholds generally do not own land ranged across different agroecosystems; the \ncarefully selected rice varieties attuned to the specific environmental conditions of \ndifferent ricelands are largely forgotten; the wildlands of the 1980s have been decimated \nand denuded; the extension of childhood into the late teens means that children are not \navailable as an economic resource; and community practices of self-help and community \nsupport have largely dissolved and disappeared.  \n  \nThis does not mean, however, that life has become riskier; indeed, far from it. While the \nvillages are just as unequal places as they were, they are also materially richer \u2013 and \nricher across the spectrum (Figure 3 [graph of incomes by quintile]). At its simplest level, \nthe spectre of hunger has been banished. Today, no one goes hungry in Ban Non Tae \nand Ban Tha Song Korn. More obviously, but less significantly, it can also be seen \nreflected in consumerist markers of status: in the ownership of televisions, mobile \nphones, motorbikes, pick-up trucks, microwave ovens, refrigerators and electric rice \ncookers.\n2\n Moreover, in the place of traditional practices of dealing with livelihood risks are \nnew schemes and practices (Table 2). The key changes here are concurrent shifts from \nfarm to non-farm, from local to extra-local, from social to economic, and from community \nto state. These transformations, we suggest, are profound in the way in which they have \nrestructured how rural people experience, think about and respond to livelihood risks. \n \nIn the 1980s, the field notes of the first author record parents saying they could not see \nthe utility of going to school beyond learning to read the back of a pesticide packet and \ncalculating the interest on a loan or the return from selling 500 kg of rice. Why, they \nwould rhetorically ask, does a child need to learn history or English? By the 1990s, the \nvalue of education was unquestioned \u2013 and the more, the better. During the Thai \nfinancial crisis of 1997-98 \u2013 which led to a contraction of more than 10% in the Thai \neconomy (four times greater than that expected from the current crisis) \u2013 the World Bank \nand many analysts predicted that poorer households would have to take their children out \nof school, and that this would have long-term effects on their livelihoods and on \nThailand\u201fs wider development prospects (World Bank 1998, but also see World Bank \n1999).\n 3\n But in a separate study conducted in the district of Sanpathong in Chiang Mai \n                                                 \n2\n A point that Grandstaff et al also make for the region as a while (2009: 290-291). \n \n3\n The Thai economy expanded by 2.6% in 2008 and is projected to contract by -2.7% in 2009 \n(World Bank 2009: 4). In 1998 the Thai economy contracted by over 10%. \nprovince in 1999-2000, not a single child was removed from the local school during the \nmonths of the crisis (Rigg and Sakunee Nattapoolwat 2001). Households took many \nother actions to adapt and adjust to tide themselves over the crisis: they sold assets, \nborrowed money, cut back on certain foods, and sent returning laid-off sons and \ndaughters back to the city to find work as soon as possible. But they did not take their \nchildren out of school. \n \nIn 1980 it was hard for teachers to convince parents to send their sons and daughters to \nschool beyond the four years of compulsory basic primary education; by the turn of the \nMillennium parents would do all they could to keep their children in school. Children have \nbecome an economic resource not through their immediate labour value but through their \nfuture value secured by their engagement in new arenas of skill- and education-intensive \nwork which might then provide a stream of remittances to sustain parents in later life. As \nindicative of this shift in the relative values ascribed to different assets, there have been \nreports of farmers selling their land to finance their children\u201fs education (Phusadee \nArunmas 2009: B14) \u2013 although it should be added that there was no evidence of this \nfrom Ban No Tae and Ban Tha Song Korn, possibly because other routes to financing \neducation were available to families. \n \nThe \u201estate\u201f, while not quite the developmental state of East Asian persuasion (but see \nDixon 2001, Booth 1999), is hard to escape in rural areas of Thailand. Powerfully, though \nindirectly, the inhabitants of Ban Non Tae and Ban Tha Song Korn are connected to the \nworld beyond the village by roads, bridges and electrification, and well as by education \nand diversifying social networks. These, in turn, bring television and newspapers and \nmental connections which are at least as important as the heightened levels of mobility \nthat improving transport has allowed. Successive Thai governments have also invested \nin a plethora of other areas; in education and health care, in family planning and \nagricultural extension, in subsidised loans to farmers and clean water, in support for farm \ninputs and the subsidisation of outputs, and in training and irrigation projects. This is not, \nof course, all \u201efree\u201f: villagers are indebted to a degree that was not the case in the 1980s, \nand this debt is guaranteed using farmers traditionally most precious asset \u2013 their land. \nIronically, many of the investments that the state has made in rural areas of Thailand \nhave done more to extract people from the countryside and from farming, than they have \nto support rural living and farm-based livelihoods.  \n \nFrom local environmental to extra-local economic risk \n \nThe approaches to making a living outlined above also reflect a change in the location \nand nature of risk. In the 1980s, risks largely revolved around locally experienced \nenvironmental perturbations. Some of these may have arisen from regional-level events \n\u2013 flood and drought, for instance \u2013 but the impacts and responses were local. There were \nother crises to be sure. Historical accounts recount disease and conflict sweeping across \nthe region from time to time. But there was little that villagers could do about these in \nterms of strategising. With the integration of villagers into broader national and \ninternational circuits of production, consumption and exchange, so the threats \u2013 and the \nsolutions \u2013 to livelihood crises have similarly been \u201escaled up\u201f.  \n \nThe 1997-98 Asian financial crisis led to millions of Thai migrant workers being laid off, \noften with little or no severance pay. Housed in dormitories or rented rooms close to the \nfactories and building sites where they worked, many returned to their villages in rural \nareas \u2013 villages like Ban Non Tae and Ban Tha Song Korn. The 2008-9 crisis has \nproduced a similar set of effects, albeit less pronounced. A global economic crisis has led \nto loss of employment (or a reduction in hours worked) in the industrial and service \nsectors in Thailand, which is particularly pronounced among younger workers; migrant \nworkers have been laid off, many without compensation; remittances to rural areas have \n                                                                                                                                            \n \nfallen; some of the unemployed have taken refuge in their villages of origin; and \nagriculture has struggled to absorb these laid-off workers, putting rural economies under \nadditional strain (World Bank 2009, NSO 2009).\n4\n In consequence, poverty is projected to \nrise in 2009. \n \nThere has been a quite vigorous debate about what these economic crises mean for rural \npeoples \u2013 and for strategies of development. A populist response that has considerable \ntraction in Thailand is that they amply show the dangers of engaging with the world \neconomy and emphasise that stable and sustainable livelihoods need to be built on a re-\ninvigoration of the farm and village economy. Indeed the Thai government, with the \nurging of the King of Thailand, made just such a view the centrepiece and the guiding \nphilosophy of the 9\nth\n Five-year Social and Economic Development Plan (2002-2006).\n5\n \n \nUnfortunately for these romantanistas, the 1997-98 crisis did not lead to a long-term re-\norientation of rural livelihoods. The trends which can be dated from the mid-1980s have \ncontinued. Even a contraction in the economy of -10.5% in 1998 and a rise in the number \nof rural poor from 14.9% (1996) to 21.5% (2000) of the population (see Figure 2) failed \nsignificantly to do more than retard temporarily earlier trends. Just as the farmers of the \nearly 1980s were held hostage by the vagaries of climate and the marginality of their \nenvironment, so the farmers-cum-workers of the 2000s are held hostage by the \ndependencies linked to Thailand\u201fs thorough-going and enthusiastic engagement with the \nworld economy. Even the King of Thailand, it seems, is unable to wean the rural \npopulation off their consumerist, non-farm desires. In 1986, 71% of households in the \nNortheast reported that agriculture provided their main source of income; by 1994, shortly \nbefore the crisis, this figure had declined to 45%; in 2004, it stood at 37%. Income from \nremittances and non-farm activities, meanwhile, contributed the main source of income of \n63% of households in 2004, up from 29% in 1986 (Figure 4 [main source of income in \nNortheast, 1986-2004]).  \n \nDealing with crisis: social capital and the dissociation of the village community \n \nOne outcome of the processes described above, as noted, is the \u201edissociation\u201f of the \nvillage economy. This is mainly described in economic terms: the village as a container of \neconomic and livelihoods practices has partially dissolved. There have, though, also \nbeen social implications. In particular, the \u201esocial capital\u201f which went some way to \nregulating and patterning inter-household and intra-village relations has been devalued. \nVillagers are less likely to resort to community support mechanism to tide them over \nperiods of crisis and shortage; they are also, for that matter, less likely to be offered such \nsupport. As Thompson says of the village in Malaysia, while gotong royong (mutual aid, \nreciprocity) may remain a trope to encompass kampung (village) life, gotong royong spirit \nis largely absent. For Thompson, the village in Malaysia has become \u201esocially urban\u201f in \nthe manner of its functioning and there is as much gotong royong in the apartments of \nKuala Lumpur as there is in the countryside; in Thailand, something similar is in the \nprocess of emerging (see Thompson 2002, 2004 and 2007).  \n \nIn a separate study in central Thailand (see Rigg et al 2008), the settlements in question \nwere becoming more integrated and, in that sense, more \u201eopen\u201f villages. At the same \ntime however, they were becoming more \u201eclosed\u201f communities. Traditionally, house \ncompounds were not fenced, and owned space was not rigorously demarcated or \n                                                 \n4\n The Oriental Hotel, for example, has not offered new contracts to temporary staff. The \nservice charge that staff receive in addition to their salaries has also been cut, so much so \nthat a number of staff have left this prestigious hotel.  \n \n5\n \u201cThe Ninth National Economic and Social Development Plan (2002-2006) adopts the \nphilosophy of sufficiency economy bestowed by His Majesty the King to his subjects as the \nguiding principle of development and management\u201d (NESDB 2002: i). \n \npatrolled. Villagers would drop by each other\u201fs houses for a chat, to share their food and \nto engage in the collective experience of what it was to be a chao ban or villager. It was \nnormal to walk across another villager\u201fs house compound without asking permission. \nThe village was a quasi-collective space where people interacted with comparative \nfreedom and openness. Now most houses compounds are fenced and most houses are \ngated and grilled. Village ceremonies and festivities, the very performed essence of \nsocial capital, have undergone a similar process of change. From being collective and \ninclusive affairs for which food was cooked and shared by the community and in which \neveryone was a participant, weddings and other celebrations today require outside \ncommercial caterers to be brought in and participation is by invitation rather than by \ncustom based on membership of the village community.  \n \nThe same debates characterise Ban Non Tae and Tha Song Korn. The 47 year-old \nagrarian entrepreneur, Mr Suchart, laments the increasing individualisation of the village \nwhich he describes as becoming \u201clike a city\u201d where \u201cwe live on our own; we\u201fre not \nsupporting each other anymore\u201d. With regard to reciprocal labour exchange, the practise \nhas become a victim of heightened expectations such as better food served during the \nactivity, raising the real cost to farmers. Furthermore, because there is no longer a \nshared experience of what it means to be a villager as livelihoods have increasingly \ndiversified into non-farm and non-local activities, so practices based on such assumed \nshared experiences have become harder to sustain. This is not to say that \u201ethe village\u201f is \ndisappearing. Ban Non Tae and Ban Tha Song Korn are physically and administratively \nstill \u201ethere\u201f, to be found, visited and researched. There are village monasteries, schools \nand headmen; there is a sub-district village administration and statistics are collected at \nthe village level. The village has \u201etraction\u201f in these senses. But the village covenant has \nbeen fractured. We certainly do not wish to romanticise the past and see this fracturing \nas a necessarily negative and destructive process; but it has occurred, a point that is \nlocally accepted.\n6\n \n \nVulnerability and resilience in a post-community rural world \n \nThe spectre of climate change has led to a proliferation of studies on vulnerability and \nresilience. Our longitudinal study of Ban Non Tae and Ban Tha Song Korn, although it is \nnot explicitly focused on issues of climate change, is concerned with understanding \ntransformations under conditions of social, economic and environmental stress and \nturbulence. It thus, we suggest, provides some insights into these wider debates. One \nparticular theme in the climate change literature is an interest in understanding \u201eresilient \ncommunities\u201f.   \n \n\u201eCommunities\u201f are usually seen in this literature as spatially situated: \u201cWe view \ncommunities as the totality of social system interactions within a defined geographic \nspace\u2026\u201d (Cutter et al. 2008: 599 [emphasis added]). In turn, resilient communities are \n\u201cinextricably linked to the condition of the environment and the treatment of its resources\u201d \n(Cutter et al 2008: 601). When this community of intersecting social and environmental \ncapitals is unpicked \u2013 as they certainly are in Ban Non Tae and Ban Tha Song Korn \u2013 \nthen vulnerability is seen to ensue. Thus, in their work on vulnerability and adaptation to \nclimate variability in Uttarakhand, India, Kelkar et al. (2008: 571) reflect that \u201cas they \n                                                 \n6\n We are mindful of Samuel Popkin\u201fs rejoinder to James Scott\u201fs (1976) moral economy thesis: \n\u201cA way of life that may have existed only for lack of alternatives is extolled as a virtue. \nPeasants who had little or nothing to eat are assumed to have had a rich spiritual life.  Sons \nwho may have stayed with their fathers only in order to survive are credited with filial piety. \nWhat may have been the absence of incentives to change becomes a resistance to \ninnovation and a defense of traditional ways. The rich who hid their wealth are perceived as \nhaving shown great modesty, and hostility among villages is converted to village solidarity. \nSomehow, what might only have been the necessities or oppressions of one era come to be \ninterpreted as traditional values during the next\u201d (Popkin 1979: 3). \n \nmove towards non-agricultural jobs in the city\u2026many [villagers] are becoming more \nvulnerable due to dislocation and disruption of their familiar way of life\u201d (see also Acosta-\nMichlik et al. 2008: 541) \n \nThe experience of Ban Non Tae and Ban Tha Song Korn over a quarter of a century of \nperturbation offers a rather different view of vulnerability, resilience and adaptation, at \nleast in this small corner of Northeast Thailand.\n7\n To begin with, the idea of a spatially \nsituated community is problematic when mobility, migration, shadow households, \nremittance landscapes and dispersed livelihood footprints are defining features of life and \nliving across much of rural Asia.\n8\n Resilience, it seems, is not to be uncovered in \ncommunities but in the spatially distributed networked lives that increasingly rural Thais \u2013 \nand many others \u2013 live, not because they are forced to as a result of livelihood failures \u201eat \nhome\u201f, but because it is in the combination of local and extra-local, farm and non-farm \nthat resilience is to be found.\n9\n Certainly, there are instances of distress migration of the \ntype that Acosta-Michlik et al. allude to when they propose that \u201cwhen all available and \naccessible adaptation measures fail, migration tends to be the ultimate solution\u201d (2008: \n541); but migration in the two study sites, more often than not, is far from being a strategy \nof escape induced by a livelihood crisis. These adaptations are, moreover, not neat \ntransformative shifts of one type of living to another, but multiple, over-lapping, nuanced \nand contingent changes where spatial and temporal mosaics emerge.  \n \nThere is no doubt that the inhabitants of Ban Non Tae and Ban Tha Song Korn, like \nthose of most of Thailand\u201fs rural settlements, have become dramatically more mobile. \nGrandstaff et al. (2009: 299-301) using census and household registration data show that \nthe majority of Northeastern rural households are likely to have a household member \nliving outside the region \u2013 some 2.5 million. These are family members who have \n\u201eabsented\u201f themselves from the household long-term. In addition to these missing \nvillagers there are the seasonal migrants, who are also highly numerous. There are two \npoints of note here which resonate with the experiences of Ban Non Tae and Ban Tha \nSong Korn. First, migration and mobility have come to be defining features of life and \nliving in Northeast Thailand. Migration is not an aberration \u2013 as it is so often presented in \npolicy documents and by officials \u2013 but part of the essence of the Northeast in social and \neconomic terms. Second, migration sustains a reformulated household which transcends \nspace. No longer a \u201eco-residential dwelling unit\u201f, the household is increasingly defined by \nits spatial disaggregation. In Ban Non Tae and Ban Tha Song Korn one surprising \noutcome of this is that households are becoming both smaller and more complex. The \naverage size of the household between the two survey dates declined from 6.3 (1982\/83) \nto 4.7 (2008), but at the same time the proportion of nuclear family members (parents \nand children) also declined from 83.5% to 57.0% (Table 3). While the normal expectation \nis that social changes leading to smaller families also results in a reduction in household \ncomplexity as nuclear families become more common, the data from these two villages \nindicate that the reverse is happening. The most dramatic change is the increase in the \nnumber of grandchildren in the total household count, rising from 9.2% to 21.3%. These \n                                                 \n7\n Although the story here also resonates with work in the Central Plains (Rigg et al 2008) and \nNorthern region (Rigg and Sakunee Nattapoolwat 2001) of Thailand. \n \n8\n See, for example, Thompson\u201fs work on Malaysia (2004, 2007), and McKay\u201fs work on the \nPhilippines (2003, 2005). \n  \n9\n This is not quite the whole picture. It is also very clear that there is a trend to work outside \nfarming not just because it may deliver a higher income, but also because it is more desirable. \nMr Palong Piroomyu, a farmer in Nakhon Pathom, has been quoted saying: \u201cMost Thai \nfarmers who send their kids to get higher education generally tell them to stay away from rice \nfarming because it\u201fs back-breaking work with a high exposure to price fluctuations\u201d \n(Phusadee Arunmas 2009: B14). \n  \nare largely the \u201eleft-behind\u201f children of absent migrant household members, a practice \nknown as liang laan (taking care of grandchildren) (see Funahashi 1996). \n  \nThe erosion of social norms and the moral economy, on the one hand, and a disrupted \nand degraded environment on the other does not mean that villagers have less recourse \nto support structures during times of trouble, and are therefore more vulnerable; rather, \nthose support structures have changed. They are more likely to be formal and \ninstitutional than informal and community; and they are increasingly centred on the \nimmediate family, rather than an extended array of neighbours and friends \u2013 fellow \nvillagers. While the village may have become increasingly dissociated, and households \nincreasingly spatially separated, this has become intrinsic to building resilience and \nminimising risk in the context of Thailand\u201fs evolving economy. In addition the state, in \nvarious guises, has offered alternative social safety nets. All of this needs to be set \nagainst a broadly improving economic context where incomes have been rising, \nemployment opportunities multiplying, the capacity of the state increasing, and the \neconomy diversifying. \n \nState policies aimed at redistributing at least some of Thailand\u201fs wealth to rural areas \ncame to a zenith under the populist administration of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, \nand have remained in place since. The villagers of the study settlements welcomed \nThaksin\u201fs 30 baht health care policy and the one million baht per village fund that he \ndistributed to kick-start village development initiatives. They were also delighted when the \nshort-lived administration of Thaksin\u201fs successor, Samak Sundaravej, in 2008 introduced \nfree electricity (if usage was less than 50% of the allotted 10kwh per household per \nmonth), flooding assistance of 606 baht\/rai, and financial support of 500 baht per month \nfor the elderly (see Table 4).  \n \nLiu et al. (2008) in their study of farmers\u201f coping responses in China\u201fs Lower Yellow River \nnote that vulnerability needs to be seen not as a snapshot, but as a historical process \n(pages 546 and 551). Our timelines from Ban Non Tae and Ban Tha Song Korn \nemphasise this point where idiosyncratic household shocks are often the events \npropelling households into vulnerability. The death of key income earners is the obvious \nexample. This shifts livelihood responsibilities to other household members, who often \nstruggle to maintain the same level of productivity, profit and income. With lack of \ninvestment and the absence of key decision-makers, in time businesses may fail and \nassets such as land and livestock are sold to meet immediate exigencies. There is \nsometimes a cascade of cause and effect which can only be fully appreciated as a \nhistorical process.  \n \nMrs Achara Wattana: the dissociated management of risk  \n \nThe case of Mrs Achara Wattana provides a vignette into how rural families manage \nlivelihood threats in Thailand in the 21\nst\n century. \n \nMrs Achara, is a 58 year-old widow and household head in Ban Non Tae. We interviewed \nher in May 2008, and for a second time in 2009. First impressions are of a vulnerable \nwoman living at the margins \u2013 Tawney\u201fs woman \u201estanding permanently up to the neck in \nwater, so that even a ripple is sufficient to drown her\u201f. Achara is in poor health, suffering \nfrom heart problems and hypertension. Her husband was struck by lightning and killed in \n1975 when she was a young mother with three children of her own to support and one \nadopted son (her nephew). Her husband\u201fs livestock trading business consequently \ncollapsed and, as a result, the household\u201fs main source of income dried up. Later, \nAchara was forced to sell a large part of her land to pay hospital bills. Of her three \nchildren, one son was killed in a road accident in 2006, a second son left the village to \nlive in Phetchabun (another province in the Northeast), while Achara\u201fs only daughter lives \nwith her husband in Bangkok.\n10\n By 2008, a reasonably robust rural livelihood in the mid-\n1970s, had become progressively a more marginal one. It is not surprising, therefore, \nthat she has moved down the village wealth hierarchy. Our wealth ranking in 2008 placed \nAchara close to the category \u201epoor\u201f, at least as defined by local villagers. Based on the \nquintile distribution of income, Achara\u201fs household in 1983 belonged to the 4th quintile \n(with the fifth being the richest); in 2008, her household had moved down to the 3\nrd\n \nquintile. \n \nA rural-focused view of Achara\u201fs existence generates a picture of vulnerability. For \nscholars such as Jim Glassman in his book Thailand at the margins (2004), the \nmarginalisation of the Thai peasantry is part and parcel of the dependent industrialisation \nthat has also made the country a deeply problematic \u201emiracle\u201f economy: \n \n\u201cThe growth [from the mid-1980s] was predicated heavily on marginalization of the \npeasantry, \u201efeminization\u201f of manufacturing labour, and fragmentation of labour and \npolitical opposition \u2013 thus ensuring that growth on the periphery of the periphery \nwould be of the \u201esweatshop\u201f variety\u2026\u201d (Glassman 2004: 205). \n \nAn \u201eeveryday\u201f view of Achara, however, provides an alternative insight to that afforded by \na political economy of peripheral marginalisation perspective. Figure 5 [Mrs Achara\u201fs \n\u201eextended\u201f HH] shows that Achara is not alone in her rural redoubt: she looks after the \nchildren of her daughter \u2013 her two grandchildren. Achara\u201fs daughter and husband are \ncaught up in the maelstrom of Thailand\u201fs miracle\/crisis experience. Her son-in-law is a \ntaxi driver; her daughter worked in a garment factory before she moved to Bangkok in \n2008 to join her husband. Between the two of them they remit around 3,000 to 4,000 baht \n(US$90-120) per month to support their children and their \u201ecarer\u201f \u2013 Achara. A series of \nrural marginalisation processes shaped and driven by Thailand\u201fs industrialisation has \nalso provided the support mechanisms which sustain families such as Achara\u201fs. This \nsustenance, however, is intimately associated with the very processes that some \nscholars highlight as emblematic of the vulnerabilities associated with Thailand\u201fs \ndevelopment model.\n11\n Income data for the Northeast region resonate at a generalised \nlevel with Achara\u201fs experience. Table 5 shows that in 1981 farming and home-based \nactivities generated 63% of rural household income; by 2004 this had more than halved \nto 27%. Over the same period, income from remittances quadrupled from 3.8% to 15.8%, \nwhile the share of non-farm income had doubled from 21.3% to 42.2%. At the same time, \nas noted above, spatially divided families had become the norm. \n \nConclusion \n \nIt is striking how far scholars, development practitioners and government officials still \nrehearse the script of Northeast Thai villages being poor, farming dependent and \nisolated: \n \n\u201cThe popular view of Northeast Thailand (Isan) seems to have changed little over \nthe years. As still portrayed in the media, impoverished farmers forever battle with \npoor soils, droughts and floods that devastate their subsistence rice crops upon \nwhich their livelihood depends. While the rest of Thailand develops, the Northeast \nlags behind, trapped in rural poverty and increasingly disadvantaged\u201d (Grandstaff et \nal 2009: 289). \n \n                                                 \n10\n The adopted son has also left the village and no longer keeps contact with his adoptive \nmother. \n \n11\n See for example Bello and Cunningham 1998. \n \nThis, of course, then creates the context in which risk and vulnerability are framed in \nterms of a capricious environment, marginal lands and uncertain subsistence. We argue, \nhowever, that for the inhabitants of Ban Non Tae and Ban Tha Song Korn \u2013 and for many \nothers in fast-developing Asia \u2013 risk and vulnerability have been re-shaped in significant \nways. This applies to where risks originate; how they are transmitted; how they are \nexperienced; and how they are managed.   \n \nThe parameters of these changes are clear, as noted above: the shift from farm to non-\nfarm, from local to extra-local, from community to state, and from social to economic. \nThese shifts are negotiated at the local level but they are very evidently responses to \ndevelopments which have reverberated through Thai economic space linked to national \npolicies and international perturbations. In sum, they raise questions about whether the \n\u201ecommunity\u201f is any longer an appropriate unit through which we can reflect on either risk \nor resilience. As settlements no longer map neatly onto households; and as household \nlivelihoods are no longer neatly captured through a village-focused perspective, where \ndoes that leave \u201ecommunity\u201f studies? The idea of community has considerable popular \nappeal and, as outlined above, many studies of resilience highlight the necessity of re-\nbuilding or preserving community if resilience is to be maintained. But the emerging \ncommunities in this corner of Thailand are networked communities ranged across space \nwhere multi-situated households help to sustain rural settlements even as they erode \nrural communities.       \n \nResearch on rural development in Europe (see Marsden 2009) emphasises the necessity \nto address the \u201edevaluing\u201f of rural life if development which is socially, economically and \nenvironmentally sustainable is to be achieved, and points to the success of some locality-\nbased initiatives which stress multifunctional agriculture as a counter-movement to the \nusual agri-business tendencies. Marsden\u201fs paper ends by rhetorically asking whether \n\u201cour conceptual lenses [are] sufficiently developed or refined to conceptualise [such \nalternatives] as more than archipelagoes in a sea of continued ecological resource abuse \nand constructed denial and peripherality?\u201d (2009: 128). This study from rural Thailand \ncertainly reinforces the view that our conceptual frameworks for thinking about the \nnature, location and management of risk are inadequate to the empirical realities of \nchange. This applies to the units of analysis that are employed (the village, the \nhousehold), the objects of concern (farming), our assumptions about the very nature of \nlife in the rural South (immobile, farming-focused), and the ideals that inform our views \n(notions of community).  \n \n Table 1: \u2018Scales\u2019 of risk management in a \u2018traditional\u2019 Asian village (c.1980) \n \nFamily and household scales of risk management \nPatterns of \nlandownership and \ninheritance \nManaging land across a range of padi types from drought prone \n(and therefore flood protected) to flood prone (and drought \nprotected).
