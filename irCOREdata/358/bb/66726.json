Tooth tem-\nperature and thermal behaviour of gears are affected by\ngear geometry, rotational speed, applied load, lubrica-\ntion and operational conditions. Gear parameters and\ntooth pro\u00aele have direct in\u00afuences on load sharing and\npressure distribution, and tooth sliding along the\ncontact path of the meshing teeth. Relative sliding of\nthe meshing teeth under high-speed conditions results in\nsigni\u00aecant frictional heat generation, which is deter-\nmined by the load sustained, rotational speed and\ncoef\u00aecient of friction. Heat generated is conducted into\nthe gear teeth and is also taken away by the cooling\nlubricant applied on the gear wheel and tooth \u00afank.\nHeat transfer coef\u00aecients change with the rotational\nspeed, surface location and operational conditions such\nas the \u00afowrate of the lubrication oil, the temperature of\nthe oil inlet and the position of the oil jet. The frictional\nheat \u00afux generated on the tooth \u00afank and heat transfer\non the gear surfaces and tooth \u00afanks have a signi\u00aecant\nin\u00afuence on the temperature variation and distributions.\nConsequently they affect gear lubrication, performance\nand service life.\nExperimental techniques, theoretical approaches and\nnumerical modelling methods have been used to\ninvestigate interactions in relation to heat generation,\nheat transfer and lubrication effects under combined\nconditions of rotational speed and load. However, it has\nbeen dif\u00aecult to predict tooth temperature and evaluate\nthermal behaviour of gear transmission systems, since\nthermal balance and gear temperature are determined by\na number of factors including gear parameters and\ncon\u00aeguration, applied loads and rotational speeds, as\nwell as lubricant properties and operating conditions.\nTownsend and Akin [1] have conducted tooth\ntemperature analysis of a spur gear using the \u00aenite\nelement method with calculation of heat input and\nestimation of heat transfer coef\u00aecients as well as\nexperimental measurements using the infrared radio-\nmetric microscope. The effects of oil pressure on jet\ncooling, oil inlet temperature and oil jet impingement\ndepth with consideration of load applied and operating\nspeed on average and surface temperatures have been\ninvestigated in their research. A numerical and analy-\ntical approach to gear dynamic load, lubricant \u00aelm\nthickness, bulk equilibrium and total \u00afash temperatures\nin spur gear contacts has been developed by Wang and\nCheng [2]. The distribution of bulk equilibrium tem-\nperature and \u00afash temperature along the contact path\nfor pinion and gear teeth were derived and the in\u00afuences\nof face width, outside radius and pitch diameter were\nevaluated [3]. This approach has been extended to\ninclude the effects of non-uniform convective heat\ntransfer coef\u00aecients over the surfaces of gear teeth\nwith heat transfer analysis by Patir and Cheng [4]. The\ntheoretical calculation of surface temperature of spur\ngear teeth was compared with experimentally measured\nvalues with consideration of affected factors, such as\ntransmission errors of test gears and total stiffness of\ngear teeth, on the dynamic loads by Terauchi and Mori\n[5]. However, a general approach to temperature\nanalysis for engineering applications and an investiga-\ntion of the impacts of operational conditions on surface\ntemperature are currently limited.\nThe development of an analysis approach and\nmodelling procedure to evaluate thermal behaviour\nand tooth temperature under high-speed operation\nconditions is described in this paper. Frictional heat\ngeneration at the meshing teeth along the contact path\nand convective heat transfer coef\u00aecients of gear surfaces\nand tooth \u00afanks were estimated and analysed. Three-\ndimensional \u00aenite element (FE) models of the gear tooth\nwere established to investigate temperature distributions\nand variations along the contact path over a range of\napplied loads and operating speeds with consideration\nof lubrication conditions.\nIn this paper it will be shown that surface and tooth\ntemperatures under steady state predicted by \u00aenite\nelement analysis are in good agreement with experi-\nmental measurements obtained using an infrared camera\nand thermocouples. FE analysis results suggested that\nthe maximum surface temperature and temperature\ndistributions on the tooth \u00afank are mainly determined\nH LONG, A A LORD, D T GETHIN AND B J ROYLANCE88\nProc. Instn Mech. Engrs Vol. 217 Part G: J. Aerospace Engineering G00601 # IMechE 2003\nby load and speed as well as gear geometrical con-\n\u00aeguration. However, load has a more signi\u00aecant effect\non the surface temperature in comparison with the\nrotational speed. Sensitivity analysis of the surface\ntemperature to relevant variables revealed that tooth\nwidth has an important impact on tooth temperature\nvariations and distributions. Ambient temperature\nunder operational conditions is an essential parameter\nto de\u00aene boundary conditions in FE models and it has a\nproportional effect on the temperature prediction under\nsteady state conditions. A precise calculation of the local\nfrictional heat \u00afux is required to predict tooth tempera-\nture accurately.\n2 ANALYSIS APPROACH AND MODELLING\nPROCEDURE\nWithin the gear contact, at steady state, the frictional\nheat generated is balanced by the heat removal\nprocesses. These key mechanisms will be discussed in\nthe follow sections.\n2.1 Frictional heat generation\nFrictional heat generation during gear meshing is\ndetermined by the applied load, rotational speed and\nlubrication on the tooth \u00afank. The frictional heat \u00afux\nvaries over the tooth \u00afank due to changes of sliding\nvelocity, normal contact pressure and the coef\u00aecient of\nfriction along the contact path. These issues will be\ndiscussed fully in the following subsections.\n2.1.1 Gear meshing and contact pressure\nThe use of involute teeth in gears provides uniform\ntransmission of motion and a constant direction of the\ntooth normal force during meshing. The contact of a\nspur gear pair commences as the root of the driving gear\nengages with the tip of the driven gear (B2), while the\nleading pair of teeth is engaged at the exit point of single\ntooth contact (E1), as shown in Fig. 1.\nAs the leading pair of teeth is approaching the exit\npoint of contact (B1), the current pair of teeth is at the\nentry point of single tooth contact (E2). The applied\nload on the gears is shared between pairs of teeth\nengaged simultaneously in the zone of double-tooth\ncontact along the contact path and by one pair of teeth\nwithin the single-contact zone. Therefore, the normal\nforce applied on the tooth changes with the meshing\nprocess and produces a non-uniform contact pressure\ndistribution on the tooth \u00afank. Gear teeth with properly\nmodi\u00aeed pro\u00aeles can eliminate the sudden variation in\nload and reduce tooth meshing impact and gear\nvibration.\nIn order to evaluate variations of the normal force on\nthe tooth along the contact path and analyse its effect on\nfrictional heat \u00afux, the distance between the instant\nmeshing point with the pitch point (de\u00aened as P in\nFig. 1) on the line of action has to be calculated. The\npositions of the start and the end of the meshing points\non the contact path de\u00aened utilizing part of the line of\naction, PB1 and PB2, can be written as\nPB1 \u02c6\n\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\n1\n4\nd2a1 \u00a1 d2b1\n\u00a1 \u00a2q \u00a1 1\n2\nd1 sin a \u20261\u2020\nPB2 \u02c6\n\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\n1\n4\nd2a2 \u00a1 d2b2\n\u00a1 \u00a2q \u00a1 1\n2\nd2 sin a \u20262\u2020\nThe distance between an arbitrary meshing point, C, on\nthe pinion with radius of rc with the pitch point along\nthe contact path, gyc, can be expressed as\ngyc \u02c6 +12d1 sin a+\n\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\n1\n2\nd1 sin a\n\u00a1 \u00a22\u00a1 1\n2\nd1\n\u00a1 \u00a22\u2021r2cq \u20263\u2020\nThe upper sign is for a contact point on the addendum\n\u00afank of the pinion or the dedendum \u00afank of the gear.\nThe lower sign is for a contact point on the dedendum\n\u00afank of the pinion or the addendum \u00afank of the gear.\nThe normal contact pressure on the tooth \u00afank was\ndetermined by the normal force applied on the tooth,\ngear material properties and the tooth pro\u00aele. Based on\nthe Hertzian contact theory, the average compressive\npressure for an arbitrary meshing pair of teeth, pNc, as\nshown in Fig. 2, which is typical for a gear pair without\ntip relief, can be expressed as\npNc \u02c6 p\n4\n\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\nFNcE\n2pREcb\u20261 \u00a1 n2\u2020\ns\n\u20264\u2020\nThe equivalent radius of curvature for the meshing pair\nof teeth, REc, represents the effect of contact position\nchange on the contact pressure due to the variation of\nFig. 1 Meshing process and contact analysis\nOPERATING TEMPERATURES OF OIL-LUBRICATED MEDIUM-SPEED GEARS 89\nG00601 # IMechE 2003 Proc.

Therefore, absolute\nvelocities of the meshing teeth on the pinion and gear in\nthe direction of contact tangents are different and\nconsequently relative sliding between the tooth \u00afanks of\nthe pinion and gear occurs. However, the absolute\nvelocities of the pinion and gear in the direction of the\ncontact normal are identical, which provides a constant\ntransmission of motion during engagement. Tooth\nsliding is important for frictional heating and tooth\nwear. The absolute velocities of the meshing points on\nthe pinion and gear in the direction of contact tangents,\nV1c and V2c, and the sliding velocity of the meshing\npoints, Vgc, can be expressed as\nV1c \u02c6\n2pn1 12 d1 sin a+gyc\n\u00a1 \u00a2\n6061000\nV2c \u02c6\n2pn2 12 d2 sin a+gyc\n\u00a1 \u00a2\n6061000\nVgc \u02c6 V1c \u00a1 V2c \u02c6 +\n2pn1gyc 1 \u2021 d1=d2\u2026 \u2020\n6061000\n\u20266\u2020\nThe meaning of the upper\/lower sign used here is the\nsame as that explained for equation (3).\nPower loss in the contact is determined by the product\nof sliding velocity and the component of force that is\ntangential to the gear surface. The latter is linked to the\nnormal force on the gear via the coef\u00aecient of friction.\nWithin gear contacts the friction coef\u00aecient depends on\na number of parameters, including pressure angle,\nspeed, width, lubricant viscosity and roughness [6].\nTherefore the coef\u00aecient of friction changes with\nrotational speed and contact load along the contact\npath. For an arbitrary meshing location on the contact\ntooth, the coef\u00aecient of friction can be given by\nmc \u02c6 0:002\nFNc\nb60:001\n\u00b3 \u00b40:2\n6\n2\ncos a\u2026V1c \u2021 V2c\u2020REc60:001\n\u00b5 \u00b60:2\nZ\u00a10:05XR\n\u20267\u2020\nOriginally, equation (7) has been used to estimate a\nmean coef\u00aecient of friction and has been correlated from\na number of experimental programmes [7]. However,\nfollowing the comments in reference [6], in the present\nanalysis it has been adopted to estimate the local friction\ncoef\u00aecient within the contact. Its application will be\ndiscussed more fully later in the paper.\nWithin equation (7), for surfaces of identical rough-\nness, the parameter XR is given by\nXR \u02c6 3:8\nSR\nd1\n\u00b3 \u00b40:25\nFor a surface roughness SR of 0.6mm Ra and pitch\ndiameter of 79.95mm, XR assumes a value of 1.12.

However, as more precise data\nbecomes available it may be incorporated readily into\nthe model. Every tooth on the pinion or gear receives the\nheat input once over one revolution during rotations.\nThus the averaged frictional heat \u00afux for the meshing\nareas on the pinion and gear teeth over one revolution\ncan be expressed as\nq1ave \u02c6\n2a=\u2026V1c61000\u2020\n60=n1\nq1c,\nq2ave \u02c6 2a=\u2026V2c61000\u2020\n60=n2\nq2c \u202610\u2020\n2.2 Heat transfer coef\u00aecients\n2.2.1 Heat transfer coef\u00aecient on gear surfaces\nHeat is removed from the gear through convection from\nthe sides and from the surfaces of the teeth \u00afanks. Heat\nloss from the gear side can be approximated by\nconvective losses from rotating discs and a \u00afing-off\nmodel may be used for the tooth \u00afank (see section\n2.2.3). The convective heat transfer coef\u00aecients on the\ngear sides were calculated by using the results derived\nfrom a rotating circular disc [9]. The heat transfer\ncoef\u00aecient of the gear surface changes with radial\nlocation depending on the \u00afow type. The type of \u00afow\naround the surface is divided into laminar, transitional\nand turbulent \u00afow respectively, corresponding to the\nrange of rotational Reynolds number values. The heat\ntransfer coef\u00aecients for the different \u00afow regimes are\npresented in terms of Nusselt and Reynolds numbers\nbased on the local radius.\nFor rotating discs, laminar \u00afow corresponds to a\nReynolds number Re of less than 26105 and the heat\ntransfer coef\u00aecient, hs, can be expressed as [4, 10]\nhs \u02c6\nkf Nu\nrc\n\u02c6 0:308kf m\u2021 2\u2026 \u20200:5Pr0:5\no\nnf\n\u00b3 \u00b40:5\n\u202611\u2020\nThe transitional \u00afow corresponds to a Reynolds number\nbetween 26105 and 2:56105; an estimation of heat\ntransfer coef\u00aecient in this regime refers to the investiga-\ntion based on the measurements conducted by Popiel\nand Boguslawski [11]:\nhs \u02c6 kf Nu\nrc\n\u02c6 10610\u00a120 kf onf\n\u00b3 \u00b44\nr7c \u202612\u2020\nWhen the Reynolds number is greater than 2:56105, the\n\u00afow around the gear surface becomes turbulent.

Two-phase \u00afow applies to the gear surface\nand the surrounding \u00afow on the surfaces consists of a\nmixture of air and oil. A simple method was introduced\nto evaluate the in\u00afuence of the air and oil mist on the\nheat transfer coef\u00aecient at the gear surfaces [13].\nThe notion of a synthesized single-phase \u00afow was\nused to account for the effects of the mixture of air and\noil, the location of the gear surface and operational\nconditions on the heat transfer coef\u00aecient. The proper-\nties of the synthesized \u00afuid are de\u00aened as\nzf \u02c6 aa \u2021 1 \u00a1 d\u2026 \u2020ao\u2030 \u0160za \u2021 aodzo \u202614\u2020\nwhere zf , za, zo are the properties of the synthesized\nsingle-phase \u00afuid, the air and the cooling oil respec-\ntively. This includes properties such as kinematic\nviscosity, thermal conductivity, Prandtl number, etc.\nThe variable d is included as a weighting factor to be\ndetermined experimentally for evaluating the effects of\noperational conditions on the \u00afow. The parameters aa\nand ao are de\u00aened as average volume fractions occupied\nby the air and oil on the gear surface respectively. If the\n\u00afow on the gear surface is largely controlled by air \u00afow,\naa \u02c6 1, ao \u02c6 0; conversely, aa \u02c6 0, ao \u02c6 1 applies to the\n\u00afow determined principally by oil.

Using the synthesized properties de\u00aened in\nequations (14), the heat transfer coef\u00aecient in the air and\noil mist environment at the gear surfaces can be\nestimated.\nOPERATING TEMPERATURES OF OIL-LUBRICATED MEDIUM-SPEED GEARS 91\nG00601 # IMechE 2003 Proc. Instn Mech. Engrs Vol. 217 Part G: J. Aerospace Engineering\n2.2.3 Heat transfer coef\u00aecient on the tooth\n\u00afank\nThe method of cooling for the gear transmission in this\nresearch is jet cooling, by which the oil is supplied to\neach tooth \u00afank once per revolution. This process was\ncharacterized as intermittent \u00afing-off cooling with a\nsequence of transient and forced heat convection as\ndescribed by DeWinter and Blok [14]. An approach for\nestimating the heat transfer coef\u00aecient on the tooth\n\u00afank has been developed based on a model where the\nfrictional heat is withdrawn from the tooth \u00afank by a\ncentrifugal \u00afing-off process. By establishing the general\nenergy equation for transient and forced convective\nheat transfer in a \u00afowing incompressible liquid together\nwith the de\u00aenition of dimensionless variables, the\nnormalized cooling capacity, qtot, has been obtained\n[14, 15]. The heat transfer coef\u00aecient, htc, can be\nexpressed as\nhtc \u02c6\n\u0081\u0081\no\np\n2p\n\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\nkrc\np n0Hc\narc\n\u00b3 \u00b41=4\nqtot \u202616\u2020\nThe \u00afing-off mechanism is appropriate for a short\nperiod following the mesh contact and ideally this may\nbe replaced subsequently by forced convection as the\ngear teeth rotate within the gearbox enclosure. On\nreviewing the literature, the \u00afow over ribbed surfaces\ngave the closest approximation. However, these were\nnot considered to be appropriate since the rib and teeth\ngeometry were suf\u00aeciently different and therefore, for\nthe purpose of this study, this component of heat loss\nwas neglected.\n2.3 Finite element simulation\n2.3.1 Heat equation and boundary conditions\nAs a result of the frictional sliding heating between the\nteeth engaged in a pair of gears, the temperature of the\ntooth surfaces changes during the meshing process.\nHowever, the bulk temperature of the gears can achieve\na thermal equilibrium after many cycles at a \u00aexed load.\nAfter reaching an equilibrium state, the temperature\nchanges in the gear tooth body during one revolution\nare very small. This is because most of the heat\ngenerated on the surfaces is taken away by the cooling\nlubricant and the time is very limited for heat conduc-\ntion from the surface into the body under high-speed\noperations. By assuming every single tooth of the gear\nfollows the same cycle, i.e. heating, then convective\ncooling and conduction, the heat balance of the gear\ncan be analysed by establishing a single-tooth model\n(Fig. 3). Applying the law of conservation of energy and\nFourier\u2019s law, the energy equation of the single-tooth\nmodel can be expressed as\nk\nq2T\nqx2\n\u2021 q\n2T\nqy2\n\u2021 q\n2T\nqz2\n\u00b3 \u00b4\n\u02c6 rc qT\nqt\n\u202617\u2020\nwhere temperature, T \u02c6 T\u2026x, y, z, t\u2020, changes with time t\nand position x, y, z.

A \u00afow chart of\nthe modelling procedure is presented in Fig. 4.\n2.5 Models and de\u00aenitions\nThe geometrical data of a spur gear transmission are\nlisted in Table 1 and are the same as the design in a test\nrig, so the modelling results can be compared with\nexperimental measurements. The gears are also designed\nwith tip relief. Finite element meshes of the pinion and\ngear for tooth temperature analysis were established by\ncreating tokens based on parametric de\u00aenitions of gear\npro\u00aeles and preliminary data [16]. As shown in Fig. 3,\nthe FE mesh for the pinion is presented, consisting of\n3100 three-dimensional eight-node linear rectangular\nelements with a total of 4176 nodes. The material of the\npinion and gear in the FE simulation was 665M17 (EN-\n34) steel. The mechanical and thermal properties are\ngiven in Table 2. This gear geometry was chosen since\nexperimental data had been gathered for this gear set.\nPractically, gears of lower module are used in high-speed\napplications and a separate experimental study on such\ngears has been carried out. This gear set was case-\nhardened and ground to a surface \u00aenish of 0.6 mmRa.\nThe in\u00afuence of this \u00aenish is included in the equation\nde\u00aening XR. The lubrication oil used is Mobil Jet II and\nits properties are listed in Table 3.\nTo establish the quality of the simulation, results are\ncompared with measurements conducted as part of an\nexperimental programme. To summarize the salient\npoints from the programme, the surface temperature of\nthe pinion tooth was inferred from infrared camera\nFig. 4 Modelling procedure of tooth temperature analysis\nOPERATING TEMPERATURES OF OIL-LUBRICATED MEDIUM-SPEED GEARS 93\nG00601 # IMechE 2003 Proc. Instn Mech. Engrs Vol. 217 Part G: J. Aerospace Engineering\nmeasurements and tooth temperature was measured\nusing thermocouples. The thermocouples were\nembedded into the gears and held in place using glue,\nas the aim of the experiments was to measure a steady\nstate temperature. The signals were routed to a data\nacquisition system via a slip ring unit. The infrared\ncamera was positioned and directed to measure tem-\nperature on the \u00afank surface of the gear 1808 down-\nstream from the contact point. To do so it was necessary\nto calibrate the camera to account for the oil spray\nwithin the chamber and the background temperature\nwithin the chamber itself. This was achieved by using the\noil supply temperature as a black body reference and\nestablishing a relationship with the tooth temperature\nfor a range of oil temperatures (see Fig. 5) [17]. During\nthe course of the experiments, oil was delivered on to the\ndriving \u00afank in the downward direction of meshing at a\n\u00afowrate of 380ml\/min through a small nozzle under\nconditions that allowed a spray to form in the chamber.\nThe gear sump was drained immediately to prevent the\naccumulation of lubricant and the penalty of churning\nlosses.\nFE models with different combinations of operating\nconditions were established for evaluating the in\u00afuences\nof load, speed, heat transfer coef\u00aecient, ambient and oil\ninlet temperatures, and gear geometry on tooth tem-\nperature variations. Rotational speeds were assumed to\nbe 2000\u00b110000 r\/min and the tooth normal load was\nvaried in the range 106.6\u00b1447.4N\/mm, thereby cover-\ning the operational conditions for the experimental\nmeasurements of tooth temperature. The loads applied\nin the FE simulations were de\u00aened by load cases A to G;\nvalues of the torque and the maximum normal pressure\nfor these cases are listed in Table 4. Based on the\nexperimental data, the oil inlet and ambient tempera-\ntures were assumed to be 90 and 70 8C respectively.\n3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n3.1 Frictional heat \u00afux\nBy applying the computer program that has been\ndeveloped as part of this research, the sliding velocity,\nTable 1 Gear geometric data\nNumber of teeth Z1\u02c6 15, Z2\u02c6 16 Module m\u02c6 5.33mm\nPressure angle a\u02c6 268 Tooth width b\u02c6 4.775mm\nPitch diameter d1\u02c6Z1m\u02c6 79.95mm\nd2\u02c6Z2m\u02c6 85.28mm\nTip diameter da1\u02c6 90.61mm\nda2\u02c6 95.94mm\nRoot diameter df1\u02c6 66.63mm\ndf2\u02c6 71.96mm\nBase circle\ndiameter\ndb1\u02c6 d1 cos a\u02c6 71.86mm\ndb2\u02c6 d2 cos a\u02c6 76.65mm\nCentre distance A\u02c6 82.55mm Shaft diameter ds1\u02c6 12.7mm\nPitch p\u02c6 16.74mm Base pitch pb\u02c6 p cos a\u02c6 15.05mm\nTransverse contact\nratio ea\u02c6 1.3382\nTransverse path\nof contact ga\u02c6 ea pb \u02c6 20.14mm\nTable 2 Material properties of pinion 665M17 (EN-34) steel\nYoung\u2019s\nmodulus\nPoisson\u2019s\nratio\nExpansion\ncoef\u00aecient Density\nThermal\nconductivity Speci\u00aec heat\n185.42GPa 0.3 1.16 10\u00a15K\u00a11 7870kg\/m3 41.8W\/mK 493J\/kgK\nTable 3 Properties of lubricating oil (Mobil Jet II)\nViscosity n (m2\/s) Conductivity k (W\/mK) Speci\u00aec heat c (J\/kgK) Density r (kg\/m3)\n306 10\u00a16 (40 8C) 0.1337 (37.8 8C) 2000 (908) 998\n5.56 10\u00a16 (100 8C) 0.1278 (93.3 8C)\n0.1157 (200 8C)\nTable 4 De\u00aenitions of load cases in the FE simulation\nCase A Case B Case C Case D Case E Case F Case G\nTorque of driving shaft\n(N m) 17.4 26 35 43 52 61 73\nMaximum of normal\npressure (N\/mm) 106.6 159.3 214.5 263.5 318.7 373.8 447.4\nH LONG, A A LORD, D T GETHIN AND B J ROYLANCE94\nProc.

Aerospace Engineering\nand position of the teeth contact, while by using\nequation (7), the coef\u00aecient of friction is mainly\ndependent on the applied load, as well as on the\nrotational speed and the position through the contact\n(see Figs 6 and 7). Also, as shown in Fig. 8, the tooth\ncontact remains \u00aexed since tooth de\u00afection is neglected.\nThe current work focuses on thermal behaviour only\nand a full thermomechanical analysis could be an\nextension of this study.\nThe trends in Fig. 7 capture the increase in coef\u00aecient\nwith the increase in load and the coef\u00aecient falls as the\nmeshing speed increases. However, at the tip and root\npoints, the model suggests that the friction coef\u00aecient\nfalls to a value that is close to zero. This may be\ncompared with results published by Crook [18], where\neven at the lightest load the friction coef\u00aecient retains a\n\u00aenite level. This points to a discrepancy and a limitation\nin the application of equation (7) to estimate the local\nfriction coef\u00aecient. To explore the impact on dissipa-\ntion, the friction coef\u00aecient at the initial tip and root\ncontact was set to the value at the adjacent nodes,\nthereby achieving a \u00aenite level. The impact on dissipa-\ntion in the contact was insigni\u00aecant in this case due to\nthe relief in the tooth tip pro\u00aele. This avoids sudden\nchanges in normal contact pressure (Fig. 8). In the case\nwhere tip relief is not used, the dissipation at the start of\nthe contact is also likely to be high. However, the\nremaining calculations retain the application of equa-\ntion (7).\nThe combined effects of load, speed and friction\nproduced a non-uniform heat \u00afux over the tooth\nworking \u00afanks, as shown in Fig. 9. It is clear that the\nchanges in heat \u00afux distribution on the tooth \u00afank\nbecomes signi\u00aecant for the range of applied loads,\nespecially at higher speeds with heavy loading condi-\ntions (Fig. 10). It produces the maximum heat \u00afux at the\ntooth dedendum, i.e. shortly after the tooth of the\npinion enters the contact; another peak value of heat\n\u00afux occurs on the tooth addendum. This resulted from\nthe combined effects of sliding velocity and contact\npressure distribution over the tooth \u00afank. The heat \u00afux\nis zero at the pitch line because of the pure rolling action\nin the meshing teeth at this instant.\n3.2 Heat transfer coef\u00aecients\nHeat transfer coef\u00aecients for the pinion and gear under\ndifferent rotational speeds were calculated using the\ndeveloped computer program. The results showed that\nthe values of heat transfer coef\u00aecients changed over a\nlarge range for the speed envelope explored. This re\u00afects\non the operational conditions of lubrication and the\nnature of the local \u00afow. The heat transfer coef\u00aecients for\nthe surface and pinion tooth \u00afank are shown in Fig. 11.\nThe heat transfer coef\u00aecients on the surfaces [derived\nusing equation (11) or (12) or (13)] increase rapidly with\nradius and rotational speed dependent on \u00afow type and\nmixture of air and oil on the surface. In contrast, the\naverage heat transfer coef\u00aecients on the tooth \u00afank\n[derived using equation (16)] increase gently with the\nradius of tooth height under different speed conditions.\n3.3 Tooth temperature\nAs the heat transfer coef\u00aecient for the surfaces is\naffected by the operational conditions of lubrication, a\nweight factor, d, is de\u00aened to re\u00afect practical conditions\nin experiments. An initial value of factor d was assumed\nand FE analysis was implemented. By comparing FE\ntemperature results with experimental measurements,\nthe value of d was adjusted to minimize the deviation\nbetween the two. After several iterations of this process,\nthe factor d (used for calculating the surface heat\ntransfer coef\u00aecient) was de\u00aened to be 0.3\u00b10.7 for\nrotational speeds between 2000 and 10 000 r\/min.\nExample temperature distributions over the whole sur-\nface of the pinion tooth are illustrated in Fig. 12, where\nthe rotational speeds are 2000, 6000 and 10 000 r\/min\nwith a range of applied normal loads from 106.6 to\n447.4N\/mm respectively. The surface temperature was\nFig. 8 Normal load distributions along the contact path for load cases A to G\nH LONG, A A LORD, D T GETHIN AND B J ROYLANCE96\nProc. Instn Mech.

The frictional heat generated at the \u00afank was\nconducted into the tooth body and transferred from the\ntooth surfaces. However, the frictional heat \u00afux\ndistribution still resulted in the maximum temperature\noccurring at the dedendum close to the pitch line; this is\nexpected since the shearing energy is dissipated over a\nsmaller distance. Temperature differences in the pinion\ntooth became obvious when greater loads were applied\nat higher speeds, as shown in Figs 12b and c.\nFor comparison with experiments, the FE results were\nderived at locations on the surface (point A), in the\ntooth (point B) and in the body (point C) (Fig. 13).\nValues of surface and tooth temperatures are in good\nagreement with measurement results for most of the\nrange of loads applied. The discrepancy in surface\ntemperature between the FE analysis and the experiment\nis less than 7 per cent when normal loads are lower than\n320N\/mm for rotational speeds of 2000, 4000 and\n6000 r\/min. The deviations in tooth temperature are\nsmaller than 5 per cent for the operational conditions\nevaluated. However, the body temperatures derived by\nthe FE analysis have obvious differences from the\nmeasurements, especially for higher speeds, which is\nmost probably caused by the neglect of bearing heating\nin the vicinity of the driving shaft.\nAs shown in Fig. 13, the temperature increases with\nthe rotational speed, but the difference in surface\ntemperature between the FE results and measurements\nincreases as the load increases. This may occur for a\nnumber of reasons. The \u00aerst is because the maximum\nsurface temperature becomes much larger than the\naverage temperature of the tooth \u00afank when the applied\nload is higher, while the temperature recorded in\nexperiments may be more representative of the average\n\u00afank temperature. A second reason may be attributed to\nthe contact friction model. At high loads, the friction\ncoef\u00aecient may be overestimated in the simulations and\nthis will also lead to a higher temperature being\npredicted. This, together with a more complete explora-\ntion of heat removal by the two phase \u00afows, is an area\nthat requires further research attention.\nDistributions of surface temperature on the tooth\n\u00afank for the pinion over a range of rotational speeds\nand loads are shown in Fig. 14. Due to the non-uniform\ndistribution of frictional heat \u00afux, two peak values of\nsurface temperature occur on the tooth \u00afank. This trend\nFig. 11 Heat transfer coef\u00aecients of the pinion\nH LONG, A A LORD, D T GETHIN AND B J ROYLANCE98\nProc. Instn Mech. Engrs Vol. 217 Part G: J.

Aerospace Engineering\ning investigation and based on the FE simulations,\nvariations in the maximum surface temperature of the\npinion with load and speed can be expressed by the\nrelationships\nTs, max\n\u02c6 CS\u2026n1\u2020n\n\u02c6 CL Fnb\n\u00a1 \u00a2m\n(\n\u202623\u2020\nValues of constants of CS, n and CL, m were calculated\nbased on the FE analyses and are presented in Table 5.\nThus the maximum surface temperature under arbitrary\nloads and speeds can be estimated using these simple\nexpressions for the gear con\u00aeguration used.\n3.4 Sensitivity of surface temperature\nChanges in tooth con\u00aeguration, heat transfer coef\u00ae-\ncients and oil inlet and ambient temperatures will affect\nthe tooth temperature. To evaluate temperature sensi-\ntivity to relevant factors, FE simulations were per-\nformed to investigate variations of surface and tooth\ntemperatures with changes in tooth width, module,\nsurface and tooth \u00afank heat transfer coef\u00aecients, heat\n\u00afux and ambient and oil inlet temperatures.\n3.4.1 Tooth width\nFigure 16 shows that the maximum surface tempera-\ntures of the pinion increase linearly with load for speeds\nof 2000 and 6000r\/min when the tooth width is de\u00aened\nto be 0.9, 2 and 3 times the module respectively. The\noriginal width of the pinion tooth in the gear design is\n0.9 times the module. As seen in Fig. 16, the increase of\ntooth width causes large rises in the maximum surface\ntemperature, especially at higher speeds and loads. At a\nrotational speed of 6000 r\/min with a normal load of\n373.8N\/mm, the maximum temperatures increase by\n19.7 and 35.5 per cent respectively when the width is 2\nand 3 times the module. The increases are smaller at\n2000 r\/min and are 15.9 and 29.1 per cent respectively.\nThis is because heat generated on the \u00afank is not\ndissipated so easily to the cooling oil when the tooth\nwidth increases. This arises due to the increased length\nof the conduction path to the gear side. It also con\u00aerms\nthe signi\u00aecant in\u00afuence of heat removal from the\ngearwheel side.\nFig. 15 Effects of load and speed on surface temperature distributions\nTable 5 Constants in exponential equations for the surface\ntemperature of the pinion\nLoad (N\/mm) 106.6 159.3 214.5 263.5 447.4\nCL 35.14 31.02 28.75 27.27 26.1\nM 0.19 0.22 0.25 0.27 0.28\nSpeed (r\/min) 2000 4000 6000 8000 10 000\nCS 49.16 44.94 41.99 40.04 35.42\nN 0.075 0.095 0.111 0.122 0.155\nH LONG, A A LORD, D T GETHIN AND B J ROYLANCE102\nProc. Instn Mech. Engrs Vol. 217 Part G: J. Aerospace Engineering G00601 # IMechE 2003\n3.4.2 Tooth module\nChanges in the tooth module also cause temperature\nvariations due to changes of tooth size, as shown in\nFig. 17, where the module is de\u00aened to be 5.3, 8 and\n10mm respectively. As shown in Fig. 17a, the surface\ntemperature of the tooth increases with the module,\nespecially at the higher speed when the same values of\nheat \u00afux and heat transfer coef\u00aecients derived for the\noriginal module tooth (5.3mm) were applied. This is due\nto the increase in tooth size (and volume), which results\nin changes in heat conduction. However, when the\nanalyses were run for the 8 and 10mm modules while\nmaintaining the load calculations for the 5.3mm\nmodule, the combined effects of the changes of module\ncause a smaller rise, or even a decrease, in surface\ntemperature. As can be seen from Fig. 17b, the surface\ntemperature increases by 2.5 per cent for a normal load\nof 447.4N\/mm at 6000 r\/min when the module increases\nfrom 5.3 to 8mm, but it decreases by 5.1 per cent when\nthe module is 10mm. This is because the changes of\nmodule cause a rise in the heat transfer coef\u00aecient as\nwell as an increase in load capacity. While keeping the\nsame values of normal load on the tooth, the surface\ntemperature is dependent on the thermal balance of\nheating and heat transfer on the tooth. It is obvious that\nthe changes in module result in a larger impact on\nsurface temperature at the higher speed.\n3.4.3 Ambient and oil inlet temperatures\nThe changes in ambient temperature result in an\nincrease or decrease of surface temperature, as shown\nin Fig. 18. The percentage in surface temperature\nvariations is about +6.5 per cent while the ambient\ntemperature changes by +10 per cent of the original\nde\u00aenition for the range of loads and speeds applied. It\nbecomes clear that the ambient temperature has a\nproportional impact on the tooth temperature under\nthe steady state FE simulation. Hence, the correct\nambient temperature speci\u00aecation is a key requirement\nfor predicting tooth temperature accurately.\nChanges in oil inlet temperature produced less than\n+1 per cent variation of surface temperature when the oil\ntemperature was increased or decreased by+10 per cent.\nThis is because the FE simulation is based on a steady\nstate analysis; the heat transfer coef\u00aecient on the tooth\n\u00afankwas averagedover one revolution and was relatively\nsmaller in comparison with the surface coef\u00aecient. Thus\nthe in\u00afuence of oil temperature is not signi\u00aecant.\n3.4.4 Frictional heat \u00afux\nThe variations of the maximum surface temperature\nresulting from the frictional heat \u00afux are dependent on\nthe rotational speed and load sustained. The maximum\nchange of temperature is about +4.5 per cent when\nthe changes in heat \u00afux are de\u00aened to be changed by\n+10 per cent of the calculated values, as shown in\nFig. 19. This con\u00aerms the importance of precision in the\ncalculation of the heat \u00afux for de\u00aening the heat load\nconditions in the FE simulations.\n3.4.5 Heat transfer coef\u00aecients\nFigure 20 shows the variations of the maximum surface\ntemperature with the changes of +10 per cent in the\nsurface heat transfer coef\u00aecient. The percentage of\ntemperature variation ranges from +0.77 to +2.95\nper cent as a function of speed and load. The expected\nreason for the small temperature variation is that the\nestimated heat transfer coef\u00aecient is already at a high\nlevel; thus a +10 per cent change in the surface heat\ntransfer coef\u00aecient does not produce signi\u00aecant varia-\ntions of temperature. The high value also links the\nFig. 16 Effect of tooth width on the maximum surface temperature\nOPERATING TEMPERATURES OF OIL-LUBRICATED MEDIUM-SPEED GEARS 103\nG00601 # IMechE 2003 Proc. Instn Mech. Engrs Vol. 217 Part G: J. Aerospace Engineering\nsurface temperature to the ambient temperature value,\nwhich has been shown to have a proportional effect in\nFig. 18. Also the average heat transfer coef\u00aecient on the\n\u00afank is at a lower value in comparison with the surface\nheat transfer coef\u00aecient. As a consequence, +10 per\ncent changes of \u00afank heat transfer coef\u00aecient caused\nminimal variations of surface temperature of less than\n+1 per cent.\n4 CONCLUSIONS\nFrom the modelling procedure developed and analytical\nresults discussed in the previous sections, the following\nconclusions have been drawn:\n1. An analysis and modelling procedure for predicting\nthermal behaviour and determining the tooth tem-\nFig. 17 Effects of tooth module on the maximum surface temperature\nH LONG, A A LORD, D T GETHIN AND B J ROYLANCE104\nProc.

The frictional heat \u00afux along the contact path of the\nmeshing teeth and heat transfer coef\u00aecients on the\ngear surface and tooth \u00afank were estimated. Steady\nstate tooth temperatures were predicted, provided\nthat basic experimental results were known to de\u00aene\nboundary conditions for the FE model.\n3. FE results of tooth surface temperatures are in good\nagreement with the experimental measurements and\nthe general deviations are less than 7 per cent. The\ntooth temperature is mainly determined by load and\nspeed as well as gear geometrical con\u00aeguration. Load\nhas a more signi\u00aecant effect on the tooth temperature\nin comparison with the rotational speed, re\u00afecting\nthe dominance of load in determining the coef\u00aecient\nof friction in the contact.\n4. A sensitivity analysis of the surface temperature\nrevealed that tooth geometry has an important\nimpact on tooth temperature variations and distribu-\ntions, especially the changes of tooth width. Ambient\ntemperature under operational conditions is an\nessential parameter to de\u00aene boundary conditions\nin FE models. The 10 per cent change of the surface\nheat transfer coef\u00aecient has a small impact on the\nbalanced surface temperature, while the changes of\nthe heat transfer coef\u00aecient of the tooth \u00afank and oil\ntemperature do not produce obvious in\u00afuences on\nthe surface temperature. Precise calculation of the\nfrictional heat \u00afux is required to predict tooth\ntemperature accurately.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors acknowledge the \u00aenancial support of the\nEuropean Union under the INTRANS Project and the\nsupport of Turbomeca and Eurocopter, France.\nREFERENCES\n1 Townsend, D.
