DESIGN: Prospective study of self-declared treatment preference following receipt of a validated patient information pack. PARTICIPANTS: Men aged 65-84 years (n=237) with asymptomatic aneurysm (4.0-5.4 cm) detected by population-based screening. METHODS: An unbiased, validated patient information pack and questionnaire were developed to conduct a postal survey. RESULTS: One hundred sixty seven participants (70%) returned a completed questionnaire; 24 (10%) did not respond at all. Initially, only 38 (23%) declared a treatment preference. After reading the information pack, 130 participants (80%) declared a treatment preference: 30 preferred open repair (18%), 77 endovascular repair (46%), 23 were happy with either option (14%) and only 34 remained without any preference (20%).
