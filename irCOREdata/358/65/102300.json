INTRODUCTION\nTOTAL internal reflection optical switches based upon car-rier injection have been previously reported in both silicon\n[1]\u2013[5] and other semiconductor materials [6]\u2013[9]. The advan-\ntages of such a switch over other topologies are that it can poten-\ntially be designed to be wavelength insensitive and polarization\ninsensitive. This type of optical switch is generally of the order\nof an order of magnitude shorter than many other switching\ntopologies.\nThe importance of having a precise controllable reflection in-\nterface in this type of switch is widely acknowledged [2]\u2013[5],\n[9], and problems caused by the high injection currents required\nfor switching have been discussed [6].\nIn devices fabricated in materials other than silicon, attempts\nhave been made to confine the injected carriers to certain re-\ngions within the device to create a refractive index discontinuity\nand, therefore, a precise and controllable reflection interface\nduring switching. Another motivation for using carrier confine-\nment is to reduce the required injection current [6]\u2013[8]. While\nthese devices have all reported an improved performance, none\nof the designs show any method of lateral carrier restriction in\nthe guiding layer itself, and, therefore, carriers are still able to\nManuscript received March 15, 2007; revised November 16, 2007.

Furthermore, since the injection region is com-\npletely isolated from the surrounding semiconductor, these de-\nvices can be packed in close proximity in switching matrices or\nother optical circuits without crosstalk, aiding integration, and\nimproving the packing density, while also minimizing the injec-\ntion current.\nModeling data suggests that switching times of the order of\n5 ns can be achieved with a switching current of the order of\n30 mA, showing improvement over previous SOI-based devices.\nThe device is investigated in this paper for TE polarized light.\nII. SWITCH DESIGN AND FABRICATION\nThe layout of the proposed switch is shown in Figs. 1 and 2.\nAn example design is described to enable specific modeling to\nbe carried out, but the design is scalable to improve switching\nperformance. Consider a design comprising two rib waveguides\nof height 4 m, width 2.8 m, and slab height 1.77 m in-\ntercepting at an angle . These rib waveguide dimensions are\nchosen to give both single mode performance and polarization\nindependent propagation.\nA 100-nm-deep, 1- m-wide P-type doped region ( \/cm )\nis located along the top of the reflection interface and a\n1- m-deep, 1- m-wide N-type doped region ( \/cm ) exists\nat the top of the slab, with ohmic connections to an anode and\ncathode, respectively. These doped regions are separated by\nintrinsic single crystal silicon to, therefore, set up a P-i-N diode\nstructure on one side of the reflection interface.\nAn aluminium layer directly on top of the rib can be problem-\natic in terms of optical absorption. Experimental evidence has\nbeen produced to confirm that this loss is small as follows.\nRib waveguides have been produced with dimensions similar\nto those used for the switches. Aluminium has then been sput-\ntered onto the surface and patterned using liftoff to leave dif-\nferent length strips of aluminium on different waveguides.\nFig. 3 is an optical microscope image showing a range of\nwaveguides with different length strips of aluminium on top.\n0733-8724\/$25.00 \u00a9 2008 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Diagram of device layout.\nFig. 2. Cross-sectional view along line XX.\nFig. 3. Layout of aluminium loss experiment.\nFig. 4. Excess loss caused by different lengths of aluminium.\nBroadband light of wavelength around 1550 nm has been cou-\npled into each waveguide and the output power measured. Fig. 4\nshows the change in optical power caused by the increases in the\naluminium strip length. The length of anode used in the switch\nis less than 100 m. This corresponds to an optical loss of less\nthan 0.5 dB, which is not significant.\nA thin SiO barrier exists along the center of the interception\nregion and continues around a region on the side of the inter-\nception that contains the P-i-N diode to completely enclose the\nactive region of the device. Note that away from the reflection\nboundary, the oxide barrier is kept normal to the direction of\nthe propagating light to minimize the thickness of SiO through\nwhich the light propagates. The SiO layer extends to the buried\noxide layer to, therefore, completely electrically isolate the in-\njection region of the device.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

SEM images of ribs profiles produced when using different etch gas\nflow rates.\nOne proposed fabrication process is as follows. First, the thin\noxide barriers are to be formed. This is done by first etching\ntrenches through the silicon overlayer down to the buried oxide\nlayer. The position of the edges of these trenches corresponds to\nthe position of the SiO barriers. The surface of the trenches can\nthen be oxidized so that they have a thin SiO layer on them. The\ntrenches may then be refilled by LPCVD deposition of polysil-\nicon and the surface planarized by using chemical mechanical\npolishing.\nIt is appreciated that polysilicon has a greater propagation\nloss than crystalline silicon. However, polysilicon waveguides\nproduced by LPCVD deposition with subsequent annealing and\nchemical mechanical polishing have been demonstrated with\nlosses of 34 dB\/cm [12]. In this device, the light propagates\nthrough a length of approximately 100 m, which corresponds\nto a loss of under 0.35 dB.\nIt is also appreciated that the refractive index of the deposited\npolysilicon and the single crystal silicon may not be perfectly\nmatch as to produce a refractive index difference on either\nside of the reflection interface before a forward bias is applied.\nThermal processing can be used to reduce and control this\ndifference. Further light doping or light damage formation can\nbe used to tune the index to match that of the crystalline silicon\nas required.\nAfter sample surface planarization, the rib waveguides can\nbe formed by etching into the surface of the overlayer. Both\nrib and trench etches can be performed by using the Bosch RIE\nprocess. This process allows the formation of vertical sidewalls\nby carefully tuning the etch parameters. Experimental work has\nbeen performed to confirm that the angle of the sidewall can be\ncontrolled by adjusting the etch gas flow rate. Fig. 5 is an SEM\nimage of rib waveguide profiles showing that when a low flow\nrate (50 sccm) is used a large sidewall angle is produced. As the\nflow rate is increased, the angle becomes smaller until it begins\nto slightly undercut as is the case when flow rate of 130 sccm\nis used (also shown). Vertical sidewalls have been repeatably\nproduced when a flow rate of 125 sccm is used.\nOnce the ribs have been formed, the doped regions can be\nproduced via ion implantation of boron and phosphorus for the\np and n type regions, respectively. Thermal annealing can be\nused to activate the dopants. A top SiO cladding layer can be\ndeposited via PECVD and metal contacts added by sputtering\nan aluminum film.\nIII. SWITCHING OPERATION\nUnder zero bias conditions, the input light propagates along\nthe input waveguide and passes through the reflection interface\nto the \u201cTransmitted\u201d output waveguide. When the device is\nforward biased, carriers are injected into, and fill the region\nwithin the inner oxide barrier perimeter. These injected carriers\ncause a reduction in refractive index due to the free carrier\nplasma dispersion effect in silicon [13]. If a sufficient refractive\nindex change occurs, the input light will be incident on the\nreflection interface at an angle greater than the critical angle\nfor total internal reflection meaning that the input light will\nbe reflected to the \u201cReflected\u201d output waveguide and, thus,\nswitching occurs.\nIV. OXIDE BARRIER\nDue to its compatibility with CMOS fabrication processes, it\nis convenient to use SiO as the barrier material. Many processes\nhave been reported which can produce reliable SiO films in the\nsub-3-nm regime [14]\u2013[18].\nBy using ATLAS the device simulation tool from SILVACO\n[19], it is possible to model the effectiveness of a thin SiO bar-\nrier at stopping the diffusion of carriers. Fig. 6 shows the struc-\nture used to carry out these simulations. It consists of a P-i-N\ndiode structure with a 2-nm SiO barrier, isolating the injection\nregion of the device from a nonelectrically active region.\nThe carrier concentration along the YY line shown in Fig. 6\nwhen the P-i-N diode is under a 4-V forward bias can be seen in\nFig. 7. The SiO barrier is at the 1 m position on the axis in\nFig. 7. As expected, it can be seen that there is no significant dif-\nfusion of carriers through the barrier into the nonactive region,\ntherefore demonstrating the ability to set up a refractive index\ndiscontinuity across the reflection interface.\nThe use of thin SiO layers in the guiding layer of photonic\ndevices has been demonstrated without it significantly per-\nturbing the optical mode and causing significant loss [10], [11],\ndemonstrating the feasibility of the use of such a barrier in this\ndevice. The inclusion of a 2-nm SiO layer along the intercep-\ntion in a waveguide crossing such as that used in this work has\nbeen modeled in 2-D Fullwave, an FDTD modeling package\nfrom Rsoft [20]. Fig. 8 shows the result of this modeling.\nWithout the barrier, a throughput power of 0.65 as normalized\nto the source is observed. When the barrier is included this\npower drops to 0.6 corresponding to an excess loss less than\n0.35 dB. For this reason, and to ease computational effort the\nbarrier has been omitted from further optical simulations.\nV. MODELING EVIDENCE\nOptical modeling of this device has been carried out using\nBeamProp, a modeling package from Rsoft based upon the\nbeam propagation method [20]. The distribution and concen-\ntration of the injected carriers under forward bias is modeled in\nATLAS. The structures used to model the device are exactly as\nwithin the SiO barrier shown in Figs. 1 and 2.\nFig. 9 shows the electron concentration along the reflection\ninterface while the device is under forward bias. A similar\nconcentration is observed for holes. The electron concentration\nvaries by approximately 1% along the reflection interface so\none representative point can be probed for use in the model\nwithout introducing significant error. The carrier concentration\nat this point has then been used to represent the carrier concen-\ntration along the entire reflection interface under different bias\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

The free carrier concentration has been converted\nto changes in refractive index and absorption using the expres-\nsions (1) and (2) produced by Soref and Bennett in [13]\n(1)\n(2)\nBy using these expressions, the optical and electrical mod-\neling can be linked together to analyze the optical behaviour of\nthe device under forward bias conditions. Some of the important\nparameters used in the simulations are given in Table I, along\nwith the references from which the values are obtained where\napplicable.\nIt is desirable to minimize the crosstalk between the output\nwaveguides of any type of optical switch, in both the switched\nand unswitched states. Crosstalk has been defined in this work\nas shown in (3) and (4) for the switched ( ) and unswitched\n( ) state, respectively\n(3)\n(4)\nand are optical powers in the transmitted and reflected\noutput waveguides respectively, normalized to the power cou-\npled into the input waveguide. Waveguide crossings such as\nthose used in the switch of this work have been shown to exhibit\nlarge crosstalk values when the interception angle between the\nwaveguides becomes small [23]. This is supported by the results\nof optical modeling carried out in this work as shown in Fig. 10.\nFig. 10 shows that, in order to obtain low crosstalk figures,\nlarge interception angles are required. At larger interception\nangles the magnitude of the refractive index variation, and,\ntherefore, the carrier injection required for switching becomes\nvery large (roughly 1.5 for a half interception angle\nof three degrees). This leads to larger switching currents and\nslower switching speeds. The problem can be overcome by\ntapering the waveguide width outwards as it approaches the\ninterception region. A parameter called the taper factor has\nbeen defined as the waveguide width in the center of the inter-\nception region divided by the original width, tapering over a\n100 m propagation length. Fig. 10 also shows the crosstalk in\nthe unswitched state for taper factors 1.4, 1.8, and 2.2 across\na range of half interception angles. It can be seen that low\ncrosstalk figures can be achieved at small interception angles if\nlarge taper factors are used.\nThe crosstalk with an applied forward bias of 1.5 V for taper\nfactors 1.4, 1.8, and 2.2 can be seen over a range of half inter-\nception angles in Fig. 11.\nNo significant taper factor dependence can be seen in the\ncrosstalk figure in the switched state indicating that no detri-\nmental effects have been produced here by using tapered waveg-\nuides.\nModeling has demonstrated that as the drive current is in-\ncreased (due to increasing forward bias), the power at the output\nof the \u201ctransmitted\u201d waveguide decreases while the power at the\noutput of the \u201creflected\u201d waveguide increases. The switching\ncurrent can be calculated as the drive current required for the\npower in the \u201creflected\u201d output waveguide to reach 90% of its\nmaximum value. Fig. 12 shows the angle and taper factor de-\npendence on the switching current.\nFig. 12 demonstrates that as the interception angle of the\nwaveguides increases the required switching current also in-\ncreases. This is because a larger refractive index change is re-\nquired since light is incident on the reflection interface at a\nsmaller angle.\nThe rise time has been calculated as the time required for\npower at the output of the \u201creflected\u201d output waveguide to rise\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

The interaction length (length of the reflection\ninterface) in [5] is 190 m compared to 134 m in our device,\nshowing a reduction in the use of the material. The crosstalk\nin either state is not mentioned in [5]; hence, it is not possible\nto compare the two devices in that respect. It is appreciated in\nthese comparisons, however, that these device dimensions differ\nto those in the literature (8- m waveguide height and width used\nin [5]). An optical switching device of this type would be suit-\nable for applications in low cost networks, and short point to\npoint networks in the future that are less demanding.\nVII. CONCLUSION\nA total internal reflection-based optical switch has been\nproposed in silicon-on-insulator with a SiO carrier restrictive\nboundary to create a precise reflection interface and improve\ncarrier injection efficiency. The SiO barrier will also mean\nthat integration will be aided and packing density improved\nFig. 13. Rise time and fall time for different interception angles and taper\nfactors.\nsince these devices can be pack in close together without inter-\nfering with one other. Modeling results have shown that for an\nexample device the switching current is 30 mA and switching\ntime 5 ns, demonstrating that high performance switching can\nbe achieved with this type of switch.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Y.
