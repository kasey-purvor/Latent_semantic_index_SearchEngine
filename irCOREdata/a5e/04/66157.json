Revisiting the recent history of urban development around Paris, and in \nparticular the Sch\u00e9ma directeur d\u2019am\u00e9nagement et d\u2019urbanisme drawn up by Paul \nDelouvrier in 1965, it sets Ernaux\u201fs text in the context of other recent portrayals of life \nin the Parisian suburbs to argue that what seems at first to be a narrative of alienation, as \nthe narrator is confronted by strange and threatening urban worlds, in fact emerges as \none of adaptability, as we watch her become absorbed into the systems and networks \ndesigned by the planners. The text offers us a portrait of an individual who is not so \nmuch modern as modernised, as she gradually becomes accustomed \u2013 or more \naccurately, conditioned \u2013 to life in the New Town. \n \nKey words \nErnaux, Delouvrier, Sch\u00e9ma directeur, New Town, banlieue, urban planning, modernity \n \n \n\u201eLa r\u00e9gion parisienne, mais c\u201fest le bordel. Il y a ces banlieues inhumaines. Mettez-moi \nde l\u201fordre l\u00e0-dedans\u201f (Maspero, 1990: 196). De Gaulle\u201fs famous, though perhaps \napocryphal, words to Paul Delouvrier in 1960 triggered one of the most sustained and \nimportant bouts of urbanisation and expansion in French history, which would unfold \nover the next twenty years across the Paris region. Delouvrier\u201fs response to de Gaulle\u201fs \ncommand was the Sch\u00e9ma directeur d\u2019am\u00e9nagement et d\u2019urbanisation de la region de \nParis of 1965, a blueprint for the reorganisation of the Paris region. His initial task was \nto confront a chronic housing shortage, dealt with mainly through the building of a \n 3 \nseries of grands ensembles; but the Sch\u00e9ma directeur was also a bold attempt to prepare \nParis for the year 2000, the ultimate experiment in rational planning. It tried to \nanticipate the needs of an expanding population, predicted to rise to 14 million by the \nend of the century, and provide the necessary framework for continued economic \nexpansion. In doing so, it would confirm the capital\u201fs place as the economic \npowerhouse of the country: \u201epr\u00e9parer la r\u00e9gion de Paris \u00e0 son avenir [\u2026] c\u201fest faire de \ncette r\u00e9gion un outil \u00e9conomique plus efficace au service de la collectivit\u00e9 nationale\u201f \n(Delouvrier, 1965: 19). At the heart of the Sch\u00e9ma directeur was the creation of eight \nNew Towns in the countryside around Paris, of which five were built, all linked to the \ncapital by a newly implanted system of mass transport, the R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional \n(RER). \nParis had seen similar bouts of upheaval and renewal before of course: just over \na hundred years previously, in 1853, Haussmann had begun work on the remodelling of \ncentral Paris. Indeed, the parallel between the two projects was quickly recognised, \nDelouvrier earning the nickname \u201el\u201fHaussmann des faubourgs\u201f (Chenu, 1994: 238). \nAlthough this has an air of the boutade about it, the comparison is an accurate one. \nDelouvrier\u201fs plan is in many ways the precise equivalent in the twentieth century of \nHaussmann\u201fs nineteenth-century redevelopment of the city. Both play a similar role in \nthe history of Paris, and beyond that, of French capitalism. \nAs the geographer David Harvey points out, urbanisation is the most obvious \nsign of capitalist industrialisation and expansion. What he calls the \u201eurbanisation of \ncapital\u201f is the process whereby economic growth is inscribed on the landscape as \nphysical expansion in space (Harvey, 1985: 250-276). Moreover, urbanisation is not just \nthe product of capitalism, but is also essential to capitalism. Capitalism requires urban \nexpansion for its survival: it is dependent on what Henri Lefebvre calls the production \n 4 \nof space. By this, he means the transformation of land into usable (essentially urban) \nspace (Lefebvre, 1974). Like a snake shedding the skin it has outgrown, capitalist \nactivity repeatedly demands newer and bigger environments and settings in order to \nprosper. \nAt various points in the history of Paris, the pressures on the system have grown \ntoo great, and produced sudden and brutal restructurings of capitalist space, moments of \nwhat Harvey terms \u201ecreative destruction\u201f (Harvey, 1989: 16). The first of these was \nHaussmann\u201fs intervention in the wake of the first major crisis of capitalism in 1848. As \nis now well know, Haussmann set out to improve economic efficiency by engineering \nthe efficient circulation of goods and people. Ensure unhindered movement round the \ncity, ran the argument, and unhindered economic growth should follow. The second \nmoment is Delouvrier\u201fs plan for the development of the Paris region. Not only did \nDelouvrier\u201fs reorganisation of the Paris region share Haussmann\u201fs economic \nmotivations. Like his predecessor, Delouvrier also recognised that the key to improving \nefficiency, productivity and growth lay in improving and accelerating circulation, of \nboth goods and people. Hence the reason why the RER rapid transport system forms the \nbackbone of his plan. It is intended to ensure the smooth flow of large quantities of \nworkers around the economic machine, delivering them to and from their places of \nwork, but also allowing them access to designated places of rest, leisure and \nconsumption. \nThe key difference between the two projects is the scale on which they take \nplace. For since the capitalist economy had itself expanded rapidly in the hundred years \nwhich separated them, the geographical area over which that development took place is \nitself necessarily far greater. Where Haussmann\u201fs efforts were concentrated on \nreshaping the city itself, Delouvrier\u201fs vision encompassed not just Paris but the \n 5 \nsurrounding region. While Haussmann annexed the communes lying beyond the inner \nring of arrondissements and the mur des Fermiers-G\u00e9n\u00e9raux, to resituate the boundary \nof Paris at the foot of the fortifications built by Thiers in the 1840s, Delouvrier turned \nhis attention to the suburbs lying beyond those fortifications (or rather the railway line \nof the Petite Ceinture which had by that time replaced them). Existing urban areas were \ndrawn into a regional development plan, while large tracts of land were appropriated \nand earmarked for the construction of new satellite towns. The hinterland of the capital \nwas being called upon to play its role in ensuring the growth and development of the \nFrench nation (Marchand, 1993: 306-320). \nAnother striking similarity between the two projects of creative destruction is \nthat their effects are powerful enough to demand expression in literature and art. Both \noperations provoke writers and artists into trying to articulate the changes to lived \nexperience they bring with them. For just as Baudelaire or the Impressionist painters \ncapture the effects on the individual of demolition, displacement and the laying of the \nboulevards, so too a number of writers and filmmakers have felt compelled to testify to \nthe effects of the Sch\u00e9ma directeur. Indeed, an increasing interest in the legacy of the \nSch\u00e9ma directeur has been one of the most noticeable trends in French culture of the \n1980s and 90s especially. It has been explored most notably in texts by Fran\u00e7ois \nMaspero (Les Passagers du Roissy-Express, 1990) and Annie Ernaux (Journal du \ndehors, 1993), and by Mathieu Kassovitz in his famous film La Haine (1995). They all \nsuggest that the implementation of the Sch\u00e9ma directeur is a psychological drama as \nmuch as a geographical one, as the fracturing and remodelling of space brings with it a \nsimilar fracturing and remodelling of those who find themselves caught up in that \nprocess. \n 6 \nKassovitz\u201fs film has rapidly become the classic portrait of life in the banlieue, \nestablishing \u2013 or more accurately, perhaps, confirming \u2013 the accepted image of the \nbanlieue as sink estate and exclusion zone, and capturing its bizarre relationship with \nParis. While perhaps closer to the centre of the city, thanks to the RER, than some parts \nof the capital itself, the communities of the banlieue are separated from it by a gulf in \nterms of every form of social capital identified by Pierre Bourdieu as central to success \nin the world \u2013 economic, cultural, symbolic. \nThe themes of dislocation and alienation explored by Kassovitz had already \nbeen identified by Maspero six years previously in his journey from North to South \nthrough the Parisian suburbs. In Maspero\u201fs text, recognition of the alienating and \nproblematic nature of the environments of the banlieue is combined with a sense of \nresistance, expressed both by the author and by the people he meets on his travels \u2013 \nresistance both in terms of a desire to assert the identity of the places which make up the \nbanlieue, and a refusal to define them simply in terms of their relationship to Paris, to \nsee them solely in terms as outposts or dormitories for its workers. \nAnnie Ernaux\u201fs text is situated between Maspero\u201fs text and Kassovitz\u201fs film, not \nonly chronologically but also in terms of the relationship of its protagonist to the \nsuburban world. Unlike Maspero, a resident of the Marais district in central Paris, \nErnaux lives in the New Town of Cergy-Pontoise, some twenty kilometres to the west \nof Paris; unlike the characters in La Haine, she is not condemned to do so \u2013 she has the \ncapital (economic and cultural) to enable her to live elsewhere. Ernaux\u201fs portrait of life \nin the banlieue is more low-key, less dramatic, than that of Kassovitz, but it is no less \ncompelling. \nJournal du dehors, in effect, offers us a view from the inside. Covering a period \nof seven years, from 1985 to 1992, the text is made up of a fragmented series of \n 7 \nobservations or snapshots of scenes and episodes from the New Town and the spaces \nassociated with it, such as the RER and the shopping centre. Following its publication in \n1993, it was reprinted with a new preface in 1996. Like Baudelaire in Le Spleen de \nParis, Ernaux sets out to grasp the nature of the absolutely new, to capture what she \ncalls in her preface to the second edition of the text \u201ecette modernit\u00e9 dont une ville \nnouvelle donne le sentiment aigu sans qu\u201fon puisse la d\u00e9finir\u201f (Ernaux, 1996: 7). In \ndoing so, she is also exploring how that modernity affects those caught up in it. For \ndespite its title, the text is not simply about the \u201edehors\u201f, the external world: Ernaux is \ncareful to point out that it is neither \u201ereportage\u201f nor \u201eenqu\u00eate de sociologie urbaine\u201f \n(Ernaux, 1996: 7). Rather, its focus is as much on Ernaux\u201fs response and relationship to \nthe world in which she moves as on the nature of that world itself. It is about coming to \nterms with a future imagined in the 1960s, and more or less immediately made real; \nabout circulating in the world conceived by Delouvrier and his team of planners, and \nbeing forced to adapt to it. \nMy aim in this article, then, is to explore Ernaux\u201fs representation of the New \nTown, and through that, the condition of modernity. The specificity of Ernaux\u201fs text, I \nwould argue, lies not just in its evocation of the individual\u201fs relationship to modern \nurban environments, but also in its exploration of the ways in which those environments \naffect and shape the individual\u201fs modes of being. More precisely, the text seems to \nsuggest that the remodelling of territory involves the remodelling of those who live in \nthe spaces produced as a result \u2013 and this is particularly true when the spaces involved \nare the radically new worlds of the New Towns. I would argue too that its exploration of \nthe complex relationship between the individual and urban space, and of what David \nHarvey calls the \u201eurbanisation of consciousness\u201f (Harvey, 1985), sets it apart from, and \n 8 \nproblematises, the more straightforward view of the banlieue offered by its \ncontemporaries. \nErnaux\u201fs journal throws us into the strange world of the New Town from the \noutset: the very first entry concludes with a striking, almost apocalyptic vision of vast \nbuilding sites, and electricity pylons criss-crossing the horizon. Having done her \nshopping in the hypermarket, \u201ej\u201fai pris la voie qui longe la tranch\u00e9e ouverte pour la \nprolongation du RER J\u201favais l\u201fimpression de monter vers le soleil qui se couchait entre \nles barres entrecrois\u00e9es des pyl\u00f4nes d\u00e9valant vers le centre de la Ville Nouvelle\u201f \n(Ernaux, 1996: 12). Our attention is drawn immediately to the essentially man-made \nworld in which Ernaux moves, and which we will not see her leave. As she drives \nhome, her field of vision is framed by the evidence of man\u201fs efforts to impose his will \non the world around him. Indeed, the way in which the sun is seemingly caged by the \npylons serves as an appropriate metaphor for that effort. Moreover, the accumulation of \nconflicting verbs of motion and direction as she describes the scene (Ernaux rising up to \nmeet a sun which is setting between pylons seeming to cascade down into the centre of \nthe town) serves to produce in the reader a sense of bewilderment and spatial \ndisorientation similar to that felt by the narrator. \nThis initial glimpse of Cergy leaves us with a fundamental sense of the New \nTown as an otherworldly place. Ernaux\u201fs vision of cascading pylons captures something \nof the monumental nature of the world produced by the Sch\u00e9ma directeur, one which is \nunlike anything seen before. The landscape of the banlieue is dotted with imposing and \nmysterious buildings: \u201een voiture, pr\u00e8s de Saint-Denis, la tour Pleyel. Impossible de \nsavoir si elle est habit\u00e9e par des gens, ou constitu\u00e9e de bureaux\u201f (Ernaux, 1996: 47). The \nNew Town itself confronts her with an array of towers, offices and windswept \nesplanades, \u201econstructions \u00e9parpill\u00e9s sur un territoire immense\u201f (Ernaux, 1996: 47). Its \n 9 \ndistinctiveness finds expression both in the scale on which it is built, and in unusual \nspatial configurations and materials, \u201eles esplanades vent\u00e9es, les fa\u00e7ades de b\u00e9ton rose \nou bleu, le d\u00e9sert des rues pavillonnaires\u201f (Ernaux, 1996: 47). A combination of gigantic \nscale, new materials, and strange spaces makes the New Town a more immediately \nforeign place than the Paris of Haussmann which, while conceived on a scale far \ngrander than anything seen before, was so using recognisable and familiar materials \nsuch as stone. Moreover, our sense of this strangeness is further reinforced by Ernaux\u201fs \nconstant reference to the town not as Cergy-Pontoise, but as \u201ela Ville Nouvelle\u201f. \nDesignating the town in this way serves firstly to underline the fact that it is an \nimpersonal, anonymous place \u2013 one, as she puts it, \u201epriv\u00e9 de toute m\u00e9moire\u201f (Ernaux, \n1996: 8). The meanings and connotations which a place name collects over time, \u201eles \nmarques du pass\u00e9 et de l\u201fhistoire\u201f (Ernaux, 1996: 8), have simply not had time to \naccumulate. Secondly, her capitalisation of the term lends its referent a daunting air of \ngrandeur and agency. \nIn the world of the New Town, then, it seems that the modern is not just the \nnew, but the completely alien. Moreover, Ernaux\u201fs text makes clear that it is a world \nwhich is correspondingly alienating, producing complex and problematic effects on \nthose who inhabit it. In the preface, Ernaux highlights the psychological impact on her \nof her arrival in Cergy. She finds moving to the New Town quite literally a shock to the \nsystem. It plunges her into what she terms \u201eun sentiment d\u201f\u00e9tranget\u00e9\u201f, a sort of \n\u201eschizophr\u00e9nie\u201f which leaves her with \u201el\u201fimpression continuelle de flotter entre ciel et \nterre, dans un no man\u2019s land\u201f (Ernaux, 1996: 7). She is alienated in the literal sense of \nbeing made a stranger to herself, left dazed and isolated from her fellow residents as she \nattempts to come to terms with the world around her: \u201emon regard \u00e9tait semblable aux \nparois de verre des immeubles de bureaux, ne refl\u00e9tant personne, que les tours et les \n 10 \nnuages\u201f (Ernaux, 1996: 7). The new world has an affective power on Ernaux, triggering \nin her a sense of malaise or unease. Driving past the Tour Pleyel, she notes that \u201ede loin, \nelle est vide, noire, malfaisante\u201f (Ernaux, 1996: 47, my emphasis). The New Town \noften appears a sinister or even actively hostile force which seems to conspire against its \ninhabitants: walking through an underground car park, she notices the extractor fans \nwhich would mask the cries of a rape victim (Ernaux, 1996: 29). Noticeable here too, of \ncourse, is the assumption that rape is a possibility, that the threatening environment of \nthe New Town will almost inevitably be populated by threatening individuals. \nFurthermore, Ernaux suggests that the power of the New Town lies not simply \nin the (often negative) emotional and affective impact it has, but also in its direct \ninfluence on the way in which people live their lives. The text offers an insight into how \nspace shapes and encourages particular practices and modes of being, and reveals how \nthe modernised environment of the New Town produces new ways and patterns of \nliving. Ernaux shows herself adept at what Henri Lefebvre calls \u201erythmanalyse\u201f, the \nanalysis of the rhythms of daily life (Lefebvre and R\u00e9gulier, 1985: 191-199). She brings \nout the rhythms which structure existence in the New Town, from the basic and \nfundamental pattern of daily commuting to the more instinctive, internalised rhythms \nwhich dictate the flow of shoppers in the shopping centre. Another early entry describes \nthe crowds circulating in Cergy\u201fs shopping centre, and picks out the way in which \npeople are able to adapt themselves to moving in close proximity to others: \u201eon r\u00e9ussit \u00e0 \n\u00e9viter, sans les regarder, tous ces corps voisins de quelques centim\u00e8tres\u201f. Only the \nyoung have yet to master the necessary pace: \u201eon n\u201fest cogn\u00e9 dans le ventre ou le dos \nque par les caddies et les enfants. \u201cRegarde o\u00f9 tu marches!\u201d s\u201fexclame une m\u00e8re \u00e0 son \npetit gar\u00e7on\u201f (Ernaux, 1996: 14). Some of these new behaviours are often disconcerting \nor strange. Taking the RER from Cergy into central Paris for the first time, Ernaux \n 11 \nnotices that women getting off the train at 8 o\u201fclock in the morning think nothing of \nshopping for jewellery on the platform (Ernaux, 1996: 76). \nOur sense of the modernised lives led by the inhabitants of the New Town \ncomes also from the occasional glimpses we catch of an older world, the world which \nexisted before the New Town was created ex nihilo. Like many of the New Towns in \nFrance, Cergy was grafted on to an existing settlement, the small village of Pontoise. \nWhile the aim of this may have been to provide the New Town with an anchor in the \nenvironment, a source of existing communal energy on which to draw, the consequence \nis rather more the brutal juxtaposition of two radically different ways of life. \nAt various points, Ernaux depicts scenes from the traditional butcher\u201fs shop she \ngoes to in the village, which, like a relic from an earlier time, is to be found hidden \naway on the edge of the New Town, submerged beneath its tower blocks and shopping \ncentres (Ernaux, 1996: 41). Returning to the butcher\u201fs shop means returning to the \nworld which existed before the New Town, and the condition of modernity of which it \nis the expression. The local shop is the remnant of a world running at a slower pace, the \nprovincial world in which, as she points out in the preface, Ernaux had always lived, \nand from which she is wrenched by her move to the New Town. \nHer snapshots of the goings-on in the butcher\u201fs invite comparison with the \nworld which has erupted on its doorstep. We are made to recognise not just the \naccelerated nature of life in the New Towns, but also, and more troublingly, the \nconsequences this has for the relationship between self and other. The butcher\u201fs shop is \nan inefficient but congenial place, where gossip is exchanged, and advice sought and \ngiven; shoppers seem happy to queue as the butcher serves his clients and advises them \non the best or most appropriate cuts of meat (Ernaux, 1996: 42). The supermarket in the \ncentre commercial, on the other hand, is efficient and quick, but cold and impersonal, \n 12 \nthe checkout girls acknowledging customers with a formulaic and half-hearted \nwelcome. If transactions in the butcher\u201fs shop are based on human contact, the owner \ntaking care to greet his regular customers as soon as they enter the shop (Ernaux, 1996: \n41), the woman on the checkout who is the point of contact between the supermarket \nand the client has been reduced to a part in the larger machine, nothing more than \u201eune \nmain qui ne doit pas se tromper, ni au profit de l\u201fun, ni au profit de l\u201fautre\u201f (Ernaux, \n1996: 25). \nOverall, the reader\u201fs abiding impression of life in the New Town is of \ndisorientation, a disorientation which is generated in particular by the disorientating \nnature of the New Town\u201fs spaces themselves. Its residents have no recognisable points \nof reference \u2013 not just figuratively or historically, in terms of a sense of belonging to a \nparticular place, but also literally. When she first moved to the New Town, Ernaux \nreflects, \u201eje me perdais toujours et je continuais de rouler, trop affol\u00e9e pour m\u201farr\u00eater. \nDans le centre commercial, j\u201fessayais de bien me rappeler par quelle porte j\u201f\u00e9tais entr\u00e9e, \nA, B, C ou D, afin de retrouver la sortie\u201f (Ernaux, 1996: 29). \nIt seems that the New Town\u201fs distinctive power, its power precisely to disturb or \nalienate those who live there, lies in the way in which it disarms the tools we rely on \nmost to apprehend the world. Firstly, it is a place which adamantly resists comparison or \ndescription. Even after twelve years in Cergy, Ernaux says, she still finds it impossible \nto describe: \u201eje vis dans la Ville Nouvelle depuis douze ans et je ne sais pas \u00e0 quoi elle \nressemble. Je ne peux pas non plus la d\u00e9crire, ne sachant pas o\u00f9 elle commence, finit, la \nparcourant toujours en voiture\u201f (Ernaux, 1996: 64). Secondly, it disrupts narration. \nMichel de Certeau, in his discussion of everyday life, and the relationship between \nhumans and the places they inhabit, argues that appropriation or ownership of a space, a \nsense of belonging in a place, comes with the ability to narrate it, whether this be \n 13 \ndiscursively (by describing a route or the layout of a space) or indeed practically (the act \nof walking, for De Certeau, articulates, produces, or gives sense to a space) (De \nCerteau, 1990: 148-151). \nThe New Town is striking above all for the way it challenges such articulation \nand narration. Like Fran\u00e7ois Maspero as he journeys through the suburbs on the RER, \nErnaux foregrounds the fractured nature of space in the New Town. It is made up of \ndiscrete areas or zones which, even after many years spent circulating within and \nbetween them, she is unable to piece together. She must abandon her attempts to \nunderstand how they relate to one another, and acknowledge their discontinuity: \u201eje \npeux seulement noter \u201cje suis all\u00e9 au centre Leclerc (ou aux Trois-Fontaines, au \nFranprix des Linades, etc.), j\u201fai repris l\u201fautoroute, le ciel \u00e9tait violet derri\u00e8re les tours de \nMarcouville (ou sur 3M Minnesota)\u201d\u201f (Ernaux, 1996: 65). Moving through the New \nTown involves not so much connecting one place with another, as shifting from one \npoint to another; and as Ernaux here makes clear, with her list of different actions and \nreactions, discontinuous spaces provoke a similar discontinuity in the lives of those who \nmust use them. Everyday life is broken up into discrete blocks of activity \u2013 living, \nshopping, working \u2013 between which the individual shuttles in public transport or by car, \nbut hardly ever on foot. Moreover, and importantly, this sense of discontinuity is also \nreflected in the form of the text. For it seems that, just as Baudelaire would turn towards \nthe prose poem in his attempts to express life in a newly modernised Paris, Ernaux too \nfinds that capturing the reality of New Town requires new forms and techniques. The \ntext is composed of a series of incidents or fragments, snapshots of the everyday world \nshe terms ethnotexte (Ernaux, 1996: 65). Ernaux makes no attempt to stitch together \nwhat she sees into a continuous narrative. Rather, the discontinuity of the text reflects \nand makes concrete the discontinuity of life in the New Town. \n 14 \nOn the basis of this, then, it might seem that Journal du dehors is be read as a \nportrait of alienation, an account of the dislocation and strangeness produced in the \nindividual by the modern urban world. Doing so also encourages us to see the text itself \nas a response to the New Town, an act of resistance in the face of the pressures it places \non its inhabitants. Indeed, in her preface, Ernaux points out that the episodes or scenes \nshe noted were the ones which provoked in her \u201eune emotion, un trouble, ou de la \nr\u00e9volte\u201f (Ernaux, 1996: 8). The expression of her emotional response to, and investment \nin, the world of the New Town could thus be taken as an act of defiance in the face of a \nsystem which seems intent on atomising the individual, and replacing community with \nanonymity. \nLikewise, the reference to revolt implies Journal du dehors is to be read as an \nangry or committed book, Ernaux joining Maspero in casting a critical eye over the \nbanlieue and the effects of post-war am\u00e9nagement. Through its critical depiction of the \nNew Town, it perhaps stands as a denunciation of the condition of modernity, and \nbeyond that, a critique of the modern social order which engineers that condition. \nPursuing this reading, we might say that the text exposes a system which seems intent \non destroying traditional forms of urban life and community \u2013 exemplified by the \nproximity and conviviality of the butcher\u201fs shop, for example \u2013 before replacing them \nwith the sort of debased imitation of community on display in some of the public spaces \nof the redeveloped world, and the m\u00e9tro and RER especially. \nErnaux captures the enforced intimacy of public transport which, while it \nensures an acute awareness of the other, also ensures that this awareness takes the form \nof mute observation or voyeurism. She draws attention to the way in which passengers \neavesdrop on or scrutinise each other: \u201eune femme, d\u201fun ton ensommeill\u00e9, parle \u00e0 une \nautre, qui lui fait face. [\u2026] Pendant qu\u201felle parlait, une autre femme pr\u00e8s de la vitre \n 15 \nl\u201f\u00e9coutait en la fixant avec curiosit\u00e9\u201f (Ernaux, 1996: 70-71). Indeed, the text itself, with \nits portraits of her fellow passengers, is in part a product of the voyeurism which the \nRER encourages. A sense of isolation or abandonment also surfaces in Ernaux\u201fs \nconstant reference to the beggars and homeless people who haunt the metro and the \nRER Her focus on these marginal figures is perhaps the clearest example of the text\u201fs \npolitical edge and her intention to remind us of \u201eles violences et hontes de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9\u201f \n(Ernaux, 1996: 9). The irony of their presence in the transport system quickly becomes \nclear: it is in the very spaces which form the backbone of the modern and efficient \nworld dreamt up by the planners of the Sch\u00e9ma directeur where we are confronted \neveryday with the failure of that system, with the detritus which it produces and fails to \nabsorb. \nHowever, while it might at first appear that we are invited to read the text as an \nenlightened critique of the New Town and its modernity \u2013 and as such, part of that \ntradition of enlightened and politically engaged criticism exemplified also by Maspero \u2013 \nvarious details suggest that her relationship to the world she describes is more complex \nthan this. Not the least of these is her statement in the preface that \u201ej\u201fai aim\u00e9 vivre l\u00e0\u201f \n(Ernaux, 1996: 8), her recognition that she has in fact come to enjoy life in the New \nTown. This comment unsettles and inflects our reading of the text in important ways, \nand does so by making us alert to one aspect of her relationship to the New Town in \nparticular. \nErnaux\u201fs initial reaction when faced with the banlieue is undoubtedly one of \nshock. It is clear that she finds the New Town an alien, and alienating, place when she \nfirst arrives. At the same time, though, it also becomes clear that this sense of shock or \nstrangeness is not combined with any particular nostalgia for the older world or way of \nlife she has left behind. Indeed, while Ernaux certainly highlights the collision and \n 16 \ncontrast between old and new at various points, the effect of this is to throw the old \nworld itself into relief, to make it seem as strange or foreign as the new. A music \ncompetition staged in the New Town\u201fs cultural centre, for example, takes on an odd, \ndream-like quality: \u201ec\u201f\u00e9tait comme un r\u00eave ancien au c\u0153ur de la Ville Nouvelle, avec \nles gestes et la c\u00e9r\u00e9monie des salons d\u201fautrefois\u201f (Ernaux, 1996: 26). We are made to \nrealise the extent to which what appears to be more a natural, more authentic way of life \nis in fact codified and ritualised in complex ways \u2013 ways which can make it potentially \nas alienating as the world of the New Town. If the young or single prefer the \nsupermarket to the butcher\u201fs shop, for instance, it is because of the simplicity it offers, \nthe painlessness of the transactions which go on there. For all its conviviality, on the \nother hand, the butcher\u201fs shop emerges as a place of high ritual, where one is exposed to \njudgement and potential humiliation at the hands of one\u201fs peers. The banter between the \nbutcher and his regular clients articulates mutual recognition of their social status, a \nsatisfied and secure place within the social order. Buying two slices of ham or a portion \nof minced steak becomes a sign of social failure, a clear indication that there is no \nfamily to feed or provide for: \u201econscience de d\u00e9m\u00e9riter d\u201fun certain ordre social et \ncommer\u00e7ant en r\u00e9pondant \u00e0 la question du boucher \u201cet avec \u00e7a?\u201d: \u201cc\u201fest tout\u201d\u201f (Ernaux, \n1996: 43). The New Town, and the rhythms of life it encourages, begin to make the \nvestiges of the old world, and the desire to cling to them, appear alien, outmoded and \nunreal. \nHow, then, are we to explain not just her indifference to the old world, but also \nthe shift in her relationship with the New Town from alienation to acceptance? The \nanswer is to be found not so much in the text itself, as in its prehistory, the story of its \norigins, which we can reconstruct from her preface to the second edition. The preface \nwas written in 1996 \u2013 that is to say, she tells us, some twenty years after she first moved \n 17 \nto the New Town. In other words, when she started writing the diary itself, she had \nalready lived in the New Town for nine years. What also becomes clear from the \npreface is that her decision to begin writing the diary in 1985 is not an arbitrary one. \nRather, the nine-year gap between moving to the New Town and writing about it is the \ntime she takes to recover from the disarray into which she was plunged when she first \narrived: \u201eje suis sortie peu \u00e0 peu de cette schizophr\u00e9nie\u201f, she says (Ernaux, 1996: 7). She \ngradually begins to find her feet, and engage with the world in which she finds herself: \n\u201ej\u201fai regard\u00e9 \u00e0 quoi jouaient les enfants au pied des immeubles, [\u2026] j\u201fai pr\u00eat\u00e9 attention \naux propos qui s\u201f\u00e9changeaient dans le RER\u201f (Ernaux, 1996: 8). In other words, the text \nis not so much the story of her evolution, as the sign that she has finally digested the \nshock of the new. Rather than a critique of modernity, it is the diary of someone who \nhas begun to come to terms with it, who has adapted to New Town, and accepted the \nway in which life is led there. Ernaux comes to appreciate its lack of history, its \nanonymity, and the way in which it throws lives together: \u201ej\u201fai aim\u00e9 vivre l\u00e0, dans un \nendroit cosmopolite, au milieu d\u201fexistences commenc\u00e9es ailleurs, dans une province \nfran\u00e7aise, au Vi\u00eat-nam, au Maghreb ou en C\u00f4te-d\u201fIvoire\u201f (Ernaux, 1996: 8). \nHowever, what is also clear is that if she comes to terms with the modernity of \nthe New Town, she does so very much on its own terms. It seems that the narrator who \nobserves the arcane goings-on in the butcher\u201fs shop does so with eyes which have \ngradually been moulded by the New Town. If Ernaux offers us a view from the inside, it \nis the view of someone who has become part of the system put in place by the post-war \nplanners, and who, moreover, shows herself to be complicit with that system. It is not \ninsignificant that the first year\u201fs diary entries are made up entirely of scenes from the \nRER or the shopping centre in Cergy \u2013 that is to say, the two places where the planners \nof the New Town hoped and expected she would spend most of her time, either \n 18 \ncommuting or consuming. At the same time, though, and disconcertingly, Ernaux shows \nherself to be entirely aware of her complicity. She may well draw attention to the \nbeggars who populate the m\u00e9tro, and suggest that they are the shame of society, but like \nthe majority of her fellow commuters, she also ignores them, or steps round them: \u201eje \nsuis pass\u00e9e tr\u00e8s au large de lui, comme ceux qui ne lui donnent rien\u201f (Ernaux, 1996: 21). \nErnaux\u201fs acceptance of the system is what distinguishes her text from Maspero\u201fs \naccount of the banlieue. His reading of the banlieue is in many ways a reading against \nthe grain. If Ernaux comes to accept, even appreciate, the erasure of the past and the \ndenial of history represented by the New Town, Maspero\u201fs goal is precisely to search it \nout. His aim in exploring each of the places on the RER into Paris is to remind us of \ntheir distinctiveness and history, and in doing so, to contest a project which set out to \nsubordinate them to the capital and absorb them into an amorphous Greater Paris region. \nIn other words, while both may travel through the area at the same time, their \nrelationship to it is radically different. This difference is born not simply of the gap \nwhich separates Parisian and banlieusard, resident and tourist. Rather, it emerges from \neach individual\u201fs relationship to the world as a whole, their attitude to the past and the \nfuture. \nIn Journal du dehors, Ernaux offers us the portrait of an individual who is not \njust modern, but modernised, someone who has gradually become accustomed \u2013 or \nmore accurately, conditioned \u2013 to life in the New Town, and has slowly adapted herself \nto its rhythms and ways. It is a disarming portrait for the way in which it resists the \ndominant vision of the banlieue as essentially other, alien and alienating. Yet neither is \nit a na\u00efve celebration of life in the New Town. It stands simply as an evocation of the \nmodern urban condition, and beyond that, of the essential adaptability of the human \nanimal to its environment. The penultimate entry of the journal makes clear, as Ernaux \n 19 \ntells of her pleasure at seeing the suburbs of Paris laid out before her when she returns \nto the city on the motorway (Ernaux, 1996: 105-106), that the eyes which have had to \nadjust to the radically new world around them are eyes for whom the sight of the \nbanlieue is a welcome one, a sign that home has been reached. \n \nWord count: 5684 \n \nReferences \nChenu, R.
