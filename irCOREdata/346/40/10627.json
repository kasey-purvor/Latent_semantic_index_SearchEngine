This\npaper reviews the current cross-national literature on loneliness and, using data\nfrom two national surveys undertaken in 1992 and 2000, assesses the prevalence\nof loneliness amongst older people in China and explores the factors that raise\ntheir vulnerability to the negative feeling. The reported prevalence of loneliness\nwas 15.6 per cent in 1992 and 29.6 per cent in 2000. We suggest that part of the\ndifferential is accounted for by the differences in the methodologies of the two\nsurveys and in the questions used to assess loneliness. The evidence from both\nsurveys suggests that loneliness was relatively prevalent among those aged 65 or\nmore years, females and those living in rural areas, and that these variations had\ngreater amplitude in 2000. As in western countries, increased age, being widowed\nor divorced, and poor self-rated health were significantly associated with old-age\nloneliness in China at the two dates. Two factors positively related to loneliness\nwere found that are specific to the Chinese context, however : living in a rural\n(as opposed to urban) area, and thinking that one\u2019s children are not filial. To\ndevelop our understanding of loneliness among older people in China and other\nnon-western countries, it will be necessary to construct more rigorous and com-\nparable measurements of loneliness and to undertake longitudinal studies of social\nrelationships.\nKEY WORDS \u2013 loneliness, old age, China, survey methods, widowhood, filial\nconcern.\nIntroduction\nIt is often contended that social isolation, loneliness and the absence of a\nsocial support network are common problems of later life. Indeed, the\nimpression is often conveyed that such problems are almost, if not entirely,\nexclusive to old age. A recent survey by the United States National\nCouncil on the Aging (2000) revealed that 38 per cent of those aged less\n* School of Applied Social Sciences, University of Durham, Durham, UK.\n# School of Health and Social Care, University of Reading, Reading, UK.\nAgeing & Society 28, 2008, 305\u2013327. f 2008 Cambridge University Press 305\ndoi:10.1017\/S0144686X07006848 Printed in the United Kingdom\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.66\nthan 65 years thought that loneliness was a very severe problem for older\npeople, many more than the nine per cent of those aged 65 or more years\nwho had this view. There are several competing theoretical perspectives\non loneliness and approaches to its definition and measurement (Victor\nand Bond 2007). From a sociological perspective, loneliness can be simply\ndefined as a deficit between actual and desired levels of social contact\n(Victor et al. 2005a), which is an inherently \u2018 subjective\u2019 conceptualisation\nthat reflects the lived experience of individuals in their social world. There\nare, however, many other interpretations of loneliness and no single\napproach to measurement can establish its objective reality. Rather, we\nmust accept the multiple realities of the state and that there is no\nalternative to relativism. The meaning of loneliness lives in the individual\u2019s\nmind: seeking their individual, personal accounts may be the only way to\nits understanding. Rather than trying to determine \u2018the truth\u2019 about social\nrelationships, researchers should therefore embrace the pluralism intrinsic\nto the task of understanding the social world of older people in their\ndiverse cultural contexts.\nLoneliness is widely perceived as one of the major problems of later life\nand an extensive literature describes its extent and risk factors (for reviews\nsee Anderson 1998; De Jong Gieveld 1998; Gibson 2001 ; Victor et al. 2000,\n2004; Weeks 1994). Given its relativist nature, it is unsurprising that the\nreported levels vary among societies. For example, the evinced rates of\nloneliness in northern Europe cluster around 10 per cent, but in Greece\ndouble that rate has been reported (Walker and Maltby 1997). Most of\nthe literature on loneliness in later life considers contemporary western\nindustrial societies such as Australia, North America and Europe, and\nmuch less attention has been given to this issue in Asian countries. In a\ncross-national study of those aged 60 or more years in Indonesia, Sri Lanka\nand Thailand, Andrews and Hennink (1992) reported that respectively\neight, 12 and nine per cent stated that they often felt lonely, a similar\nprevalence to northern Europe. This study also identified several risk\nfactors for loneliness, such as marital status, socio-economic status, living\narrangements and physical health, which also mirrored European find-\nings. From a study of Abha City, Saudi Arabia, Abolfotouh et al. (2001)\nreported that 4.5 per cent of those aged 65 or more years were lonely, but\ndid not distinguish between \u2018 loneliness \u2019 and \u2018 living alone\u2019.\nOlder people in China and loneliness\nIn 2005, the estimated population of the People\u2019s Republic of China aged\n60 or more years was 140 million, 11 per cent of the total (Li 2005).\n306 Keming Yang and Christina R. Victor\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.66\nResearch on the components of the quality of life in old age in China is\nemerging, as on psychological wellbeing (Chen and Silverstein 2000;\nChen, Copeland and Wei 1999; Wu and Schimmele 2006), social security\n(Du and Tu 2000), income (Raymo and Xie 2000), socio-political status\n(Sher 1984), and inter-generational relations (Whyte 2003). Loneliness,\nhowever, has not yet attracted the attention of researchers, perhaps\nbecause it has been assumed that this negative affective state \u2013 and even\nsocial exclusion more broadly \u2013 is not problematic among older people in\nAsian countries. Where loneliness has been studied, it is often taken as a\ncondition linked to depression. Chou and Chi (2005) studied the preva-\nlence of depression among people aged 60 or more years in Hong Kong,\nand found loneliness to be a significant and independent risk factor, but\ndid not specifically analyse loneliness. The same authors also examined\nthe relationships between childlessness, depression and loneliness, taking\nthe last two factors to be synonymous (Chou and Chi 2002). Researchers\nin Taiwan have also studied the prevalence of depression among older\npeople, accepting that loneliness was one \u2018depressive manifestation\u2019\n(Chong et al. 2001). Although it has been reported in both Chinese\ncommunities and contemporary western societies that loneliness and\ndepression are highly correlated, the nature of the link remains unclear\n(Harris et al. 2003).\nThis paper focuses on the experience of loneliness rather than the\nprevalence of depression, because our interest is in the ways by which the\nchanging social life of Chinese elders has affected their psychological\nwellbeing, not just their mental condition. The study of loneliness among\nolder people in China is especially important not only because the country\nhas the largest older population in the world but also because Chinese\nsociety has undergone dramatic social and economic changes since the\nlate 1970s. According to the 1990 census, \u2018 there were 1.13 billion people\nliving in China\u2019, of which 63.3 million (5.6%) were aged 65 or more years\n(Li and Peng 2000: 64). To put this in context, in 2001 the older popu-\nlation of China exceeded the all-age population of the United Kingdom.\nResearchers of China\u2019s older people have expressed concerns about\nthe implications of changing living arrangements (Bian, Logan and Bian\n1998; Davis-Friedman 1991 ; Whyte 1995; Yan 1997). With more and\nmore of the younger generation being able to afford separate housing,\neconomic growth has produced an increasing number of nuclear house-\nholds, as predicted four decades ago by William Goode (1963). There is,\nhowever, no consensus as to whether the new living arrangements will\ninevitably lead to the decline of support from adult children. The preva-\nlence of the sense of loneliness among older people in China in the past\ncan never be known, but recent surveys have made it possible to estimate\nLoneliness among older people in China 307\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.66\nthe recent temporal trend \u2013 although not rigorously because successive\ninquiries have had different coverage and data collection methodologies\n(as detailed below). It is possible, however, to explore the hypothesis that\nsocio-economic changes since the end of the 1970s have increased the\nprevalence of loneliness among older people in China. Furthermore, we\ncan also investigate which risk factors are associated with loneliness among\nolder people. Before the empirical analyses are described and reported,\nhowever, the meanings of \u2018 loneliness \u2019 in Chinese society are first dis-\ncussed.\nThe social context of loneliness in China\nSoon after it came to power in 1949, the Chinese Communist Party es-\ntablished a high level of control in almost every domain of social and\neconomic life. One effective mechanism was hu kou, the household regis-\ntration system that assigned each person and household a residential\nstatus, either urban or rural (Kirkby 1985). The distinction was of enor-\nmous importance for most people because it determined their eligibility\nfor a wide range of welfare provisions, including housing, childcare, sub-\nsidised food, schooling, medical services, and retirement income benefits.\nFurthermore, these benefits were realised and administered in urban areas\nby dan wei [work units], such as state enterprises, collective co-operative\nenterprises and government agencies. In rural areas, life was highly\ncollectivised from the early 1960s until the economic reforms of the late\n1970s, although welfare provision by no means matched that in the cities.\nCommunes, brigades and teams were responsible not only for agricultural\nproduction but also for many other important community affairs.\nTight control and long-term employment had an unintended conse-\nquence, a high intensity of social interaction among those working in the\nsame unit or community. Whether sitting in prolonged meetings that\ndiscussed the distribution of welfare, chatting during long lunch hours,\nparticipating in organised social activities, visiting each other during\nholidays, or helping each other sort out personal problems, people saw one\nanother much more than work colleagues in normal circumstances do.\nThe unusually stable working relations did not necessarily lead to a\ncollegial environment, of course, but they did increase the level of social\nengagement among employees. The effect extended to retirees because of\nthe long-term relationships at work and the social activities organised by\nlocal communities. It is not clear, however, whether the high intensity of\nsocial interaction acted as a shield against loneliness, because it is the\nmeaning ascribed to interactions, not just their intensity, that influences\nwhether loneliness is felt.\n308 Keming Yang and Christina R. Victor\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.66\nIn the Han language (han yu), two characters or words are used for\n\u2018 lonely\u2019, namely gu and du. The former has a clear negative tone, and\nmeans \u2018neglected, deserted or isolated\u2019. It is often used with another\ncharacter, gua [widowed]. In the broadcast media one often hears the\nphrase gu gua lao ren, meaning \u2018neglected and widowed old people \u2019. The\nword du, however, is neutral and means \u2018being alone, single and inde-\npendent, or solitude\u2019. When gu and du are collocated, the resulting phrase\ndescribes the undesirable feeling of loneliness. Because there are words\nthat describe \u2018being alone\u2019, such as du zi [alone], du chu [living alone], and\ndu shen [single], there is little doubt that gu du refers to a negative feeling,\nnot an observable living situation, even though the two are closely con-\nnected.\nIn China until the late 1980s, loneliness was rarely reported even among\npeople of advanced old age. Because of stable and strong family ties, it was\nnot perceived as a problem and, in practice, the custom of mutual help\nand exchange among family members was reinforced by the shortage of\nhousing and a high prevalence of three-generation households. Even after\nthe one-child policy was implemented, most regions could not cope with\nthe increasing number of married couples. Culturally and legally, all\nchildren are expected to provide support to their parents (Ikels 1993; Sher\n1984). Culturally, adult children were under enormous pressure among\nrelatives and friends if they failed to show xiao [filial piety] by supporting\ntheir parents (Zhan and Montgomery 2003). The norm is that the re-\nsponsibility is fulfilled financially, physically and emotionally. Legally,\nparents have the right to demand financial and physical support from their\nchildren (Gu and Liang 2000). The cultural practices and assumptions\nmeant that most old people had a high level of social engagement and\ninteractions, and so were not expected to feel lonely. The older people\nmost likely to feel lonely were those who believed that their adult children\nhad failed to fulfil their responsibilities. The expectation of children\u2019s filial\nconcern, especially from sons, is deeply embedded in Chinese families and\nsociety, and fear of loneliness has been a strong motive for having sons\n(Peng 1989). In this context, the sense of loneliness partly expresses a fear\nof destitution and abandonment in old age.\nThe late 20th-century economic reforms and the one-child policy have\nfundamentally reshaped the social context in which old age is experienced.\nIn rural areas since the late 1970s, the widely welcomed \u2018household\nresponsibility system\u2019 quickly replaced the collectivised system, and has\nmade each household an independent production unit. In urban areas,\n\u2018 jobs for life \u2019 have been much reduced although they persist in a few giant\nstate enterprises. Increased production capacity and technology have\npushed millions of \u2018 surplus labourers \u2019 from villages to big cities, and\nLoneliness among older people in China 309\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.66\nhundreds of thousands of young people born in urban areas have been\nimpelled to move from one city to another to find work and money-\nmaking opportunities ; all leaving their older parents in homes sometimes\ncharacterised as \u2018empty nests \u2019 (Marquand 2004). Many of the younger\nmigrants have been the only child of the parents, and have no siblings who\nstay with them. They may send money back to improve their parents\u2019\nliving conditions, but this does little to ameliorate the parents\u2019 sense of\nloneliness. Zhenqiu Peng, a Shanghai Representative in the People\u2019s\nCongress, urged that \u2018what the old people need, more than money, is\nmore emotional support from their children. More calls and visits are\nnecessary to resolve old people\u2019s loneliness \u2019 (Wang 2006).\nIt is not at present clear whether it is correct to infer from this anecdotal\nevidence that one by-product of China\u2019s economic development has been\nan increase in loneliness among older people. There has been insufficient\nacademic research to resolve the question. Some studies have analysed\ndepression or overall psychological wellbeing but, unlike in Taiwan and\nHong Kong, none have directly examined loneliness in mainland China,\nand although there has been research on inter-generational support,\nmostly financial and material, older parents\u2019 perceptions have not been\nstudied. The analysis reported in this paper cannot definitively conclude\nwhether there is a rising temporal trend, but has been able to examine the\nforms and prevalence of loneliness among older people in mainland China,\nand certain associations with the country\u2019s dramatic economic growth.\nOur ambition is to open up an aspect of ageing and later life in China for\nfurther study.\nData on loneliness\nThe empirical analyses are of data from two national surveys of older\npeople in China, the Survey of the Support System for the Elderly in China (SSSE)\nof 1992, and the Survey of the Aged Population in China (SAP) of 2000. There\nwere differences in the two surveys\u2019 sampling designs and instruments for\nmeasuring loneliness, which makes direct comparisons potentially mis-\nleading and strictly false. As we shall show, however, there was consider-\nable overlap between the two samples. The SSSE survey was conducted in\nFebruary 1992 of people aged 60 or more years.1 Multi-stage representa-\ntive samples were drawn separately for rural and urban areas. The urban\nsample comprised 9,889 respondents and the rural sample 10,194. At the\nfirst stage, 12 provincial areas were selected: Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai,\nZhejiang, Jiangsu, Hubei, Sichuan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Heilongjiang,\nGuangxi and Shanxi. In each of the first five areas, the older population\n310 Keming Yang and Christina R. Victor\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.66\n(60+ years) exceeded 10 per cent of the total. Other areas were selected\nbecause they represented varying stages of economic development. Except\nfor the first three, which are metropolitan areas, cities in the provinces\nwere categorised by size as \u2018big \u2019, \u2018medium\u2019 and \u2018small \u2019, and one city in\neach category was randomly selected. Finally, in each selected area, a\nquota for the number of older people was based on the area\u2019s proportion\nof the provincial older population. Social scientists at China\u2019s Research\nCentre on the Aged Population (RCAP) produce the questionnaire, drew\nthe samples and processed the results. They also provided training for the\ninterviewers, most of whom were recruited from local agencies that\nprovide services for older people.\nConducted in December 2000, SAP was also designed and adminis-\ntered by RCAP with funding provided by China\u2019s National Committee on\nAgeing. Not only were both surveys conducted by the same research\ninstitutions, they shared the same target population \u2013 people aged 60\nor more years \u2013 and used the same stratified sampling procedure with\nseparate urban and rural samples. The SAP sampled 10,171 in urban areas\nand 10,084 in rural areas, both very close to the SSSE samples. The SAP\ndata unfortunately are not available for public use but aggregate analyses\nhave been published (RCAP 2003). A major difference between the two\nsurveys is that a larger number of geographical areas were surveyed in\n2000 than in 1992 with almost the same sample size \u2013 the number of\nsampled provincial areas was increased from 12 to 20. In SAP, 10 of the 12\nprovincial areas covered in SSSE were retained, with Guizhou and\nGuangxi being dropped, while the following provinces were added:\nHebei, Jilin, Anhui, Fujian, Shandong, Henan, Guangdong, Yunan,\nGansu and Xinjiang. Note that Guangxi, not selected in SAP, is domi-\nnated by the Zhuang ethnic minority. The loss, however, was made up\nby the addition of Xinjiang, an area populated by the Uyghur ethnic\nminority.\nComparison of the age structures of the two samples\nAs age, gender and area of residence are all associated with loneliness, and\na difference in prevalence between the two samples might be an artefact of\nthe sample differences, the age structures by gender and in rural and\nurban areas have been compared for the two samples. This was done by\ntesting a null hypothesis, that the proportions in each age-gender-area\ngroup were the same in the 1992 and 2000, by examining the significance\nof the z scores at the 95 per cent confidence level. The results reveal that\nthe urban samples were more stable than those in rural areas (Table 1). In\nthe urban samples, the proportions of males aged 65 to 74 years were\nLoneliness among older people in China 311\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.66\nsignificantly higher in 2000 while, in contrast, the proportions of females\naged 60\u201364 years declined significantly ; the proportions of all other sub-\ngroups showed no significant change. The stability of the urban samples is\nnot surprising given that Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin were included in\nboth surveys and constituted almost 30 per cent of the urban samples. In\nthe rural samples, by contrast, many more of the age-group proportions\nchanged significantly, principally through a relative increase of males and\nrelative decrease of females in the two youngest age groups (60\u201369 years).\nThe many transformations and changes in China, such as the growth of\nrural industries, improved medical services throughout the country, and\nlabour migration from rural to urban areas, could easily have changed the\nT A B L E 1.

The changed age\ndistribution that we have observed could be a reflection of such changes or\nof sampling variations.\nConcepts and measures\nIndicators of loneliness\nBoth SSSE and SAP were \u2018portmanteau\u2019 surveys designed to provide an\noverview of different aspects of the experience of population ageing in\nChina. Whilst they were not undertaken specifically to examine loneliness,\nthey included some indicators that enable its prevalence to be gauged and\nto assess the risk factors. To evaluate the appropriateness of these in-\ndicators, it is useful to understand how the concept of loneliness among\nolder people has been operationalised in other studies. Although it is\nwidely accepted that loneliness is conceptually \u2018 the deficit between the\nactual and desired level of social engagement\u2019 (Victor et al. 2005a : 215),\nbeyond this broad consensus, both the theoretical meaning of \u2018 loneliness \u2019\nand the derived approach to measurement are contested. There have been\ntwo approaches : on the one hand, the conception of loneliness as a single\nphenomenon that varies in intensity and, on the other hand, its conception\nas having multiple social and emotional dimensions.2\nMeasures of the one-dimensional concept of loneliness use single\nquestions to establish its presence or absence, and assess intensity using\nLikert scales, with the required responses varying in levels of sophistication\nor ordinal differentiation. A key objection to the use of self-rating scales is\nthat they require an \u2018admission\u2019 of loneliness, which among respondents\nmay induce a moderated response that avoids compromising the sense of\nself-worth. Partly for this reason, most loneliness scales are \u2018 indirect \u2019 in\nthat they do not explicitly mention the condition but seek to identify\nthe underlying constructs. The proponents of indirect scales argue that\nself-assessment questions result in under-estimates of the \u2018 true\u2019 extent of\nloneliness, and that indirect measures are more appropriate because they\ndo not require the \u2018public \u2019 declaration. The issue is not however settled.\nVictor et al. (2005b) argued that there is little difference in the estimated\nprevalence of \u2018 severe\u2019 loneliness by either the method or the mode of\nquestion administration, i.e. direct interview or postal survey, although\nestimates of the \u2018 intermediate \u2019 categories of loneliness diverge for several\nreasons, including the insensitivity of intermediate categories in self-rating\nscales and inconsistent boundaries for the ordinal categories. Survey\nquestions about loneliness in western countries usually pre-specify the\nLoneliness among older people in China 313\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.66\nfrequency response categories as \u2018always \u2019, \u2018often\u2019, \u2018 sometimes\u2019 and\n\u2018never \u2019 (Victor et al. 2004).\nIn comparison, the measures of loneliness used in the two Chinese\nsurveys were unsophisticated. First, there was no question about the\nfrequency of the experience. In SSSE, respondents were asked ni gan dao gu\ndu ma? [Do you feel lonely?] and could choose \u2018yes \u2019, \u2018no\u2019 or shou bu hao\n[hard to say]. The loneliness question in SAP was indirect and used the\nsame three response categories. Specifically, the respondents were asked,\n\u2018What do you think of the following statements? \u2019, one of which was wo\nchang chang gan dao gu du [I often feel lonely]. Whilst the responses \u2018yes \u2019 and\n\u2018no\u2019 are unambiguous, the option \u2018hard to say\u2019 is unclear. It may be\ninterpreted by a respondent as a medium frequency of loneliness,\nequivalent to \u2018 sometimes\u2019 in established loneliness rating scales, or inter-\npreted as a medium strength of the sense of loneliness. Yet again, it could\nalso indicate that the respondent did not understand what was meant by\n\u2018 loneliness \u2019 (which in strict survey practice is a missing answer), or did not\nhave a clear memory of any experience of loneliness (which is close to \u2018not\nlonely \u2019). Given these ambiguities, our analysis focuses on the clearer \u2018yes \u2019\nor \u2018no\u2019 responses.\nRisk factors for loneliness\nAs mentioned, there have been few studies of loneliness among older\npeople in China. The analysis reported here was informed principally by\nthe authors\u2019 understanding from previous empirical research of loneliness\nin Great Britain and other western countries. One British study, for\nexample, found that besides age, gender and educational qualifications,\nsix other independent factors made older people more vulnerable to feel-\nings of loneliness. Of these, three described social resources, including\n\u2018marital status \u2019, \u2018 time spent alone\u2019 and \u2018 increase in loneliness over the\nprevious decade\u2019, and three were aspects of health resources, including a\nhigh score on the General Health Questionnaire (an internationally used\nmeasure of general psychiatric morbidity), and agreement with the state-\nments that my health is \u2018worse than expected in later life \u2019 and currently\n\u2018poor\u2019 (Victor et al. 2005b).\nFor the analysis, the two data sets for rural and urban areas were\nmerged and a dummy variable for \u2018 living area\u2019 was created (1=rural,\n0=urban). Age was originally measured in single years. To make the\nanalysis comparable with previous analyses on European countries, three\nage groups were coded (60\u201369, 70\u201379 and 80 or more years). The \u2018 level of\neducation\u2019 variable originally had seven categories (illiterate, primary\nschool, middle school, high school, vocational school, college, university\n314 Keming Yang and Christina R. Victor\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.66\nundergraduate and above) and was regrouped into three (primary or\nbelow, secondary, and university or above). The health variables derived\nfrom the question sequence, \u2018Do you have any disease? \u2019 and if \u2018yes \u2019,\nplease tick any of 10 listed diseases, but there was no information about\nseverity. As the analysis is not concerned with the effect of any specific\ndisease on loneliness, here we consider only the effect of the presence of a\ndisease. Living arrangements are not good indicators of loneliness but are\nrisk factors (Victor et al. 2005), so we focused on \u2018 living alone\u2019 and ex-\nplored its effect on loneliness. A few cultural variables in SSSE pertained\nto the vulnerability to a feeling of loneliness. One on social relations\nderived from the question, \u2018Do you think you are getting along well with\nothers? that we believe would have been interpreted as referring mainly\nto non-family members such as neighbours. Respondents were also\nasked whether they participated in any \u2018organised activities \u2019, i.e. the\nprogrammes offered by local communities and organisations (e.g. older\npeople\u2019s activity centres and associations). Finally and of great interest, the\nrespondents reported their feelings about \u2018whether [their] children are\nfilial \u2019. The codes, descriptive statistics of the risk factors, and percentages\nof loneliness for the sub-groups are shown in Table 2.\nResults\nPrevalence of loneliness among older people in China\nWe begin by examining the prevalence of loneliness among older people\nin China. To reiterate, although estimates from the two surveys are\npresented, it is not assumed that they are comparable. Table 3 shows that\n15.6 per cent of elders in 1992 and 29.6 per cent in 2000 replied \u2018yes \u2019 to the\nquestion about loneliness, whilst the percentage that answered \u2018no\u2019 was\n77.9 per cent in 1992 and 57.8 per cent in 2000. This suggests that over\nthe eight years between the surveys the percentage of older people in\nChina that felt lonely increased substantially.3 To establish whether\nthe change was real or an artefact, better designed studies are needed to\nverify this preliminary but intriguing observation. Even if there was an\nincrease in overall rates of loneliness between 1992 and 2000, it did not\napply to all subgroups. The reported level increased among both females\nand males aged 65\u201369 years in urban areas, among females in this\nage group in rural areas, and also in rural areas among females aged\n70\u201374 years and males aged 75\u201379 years. By contrast, among females aged\n60\u201364 years in both rural and urban areas, the percentage reporting\nloneliness declined from 1992 (24% and 28% respectively) to 2000 (around\n22%).\nLoneliness among older people in China 315\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.66\nTo examine the relationships of loneliness with gender, age and living\narea, adjusted odds ratios were calculated for 1992 and 2000 (Table 4).\nThese odds ratios measure the correlation between each of the three\nindependent variables and loneliness when controlling for the effects of the\nother two variables.4 The results show that the likelihood of reported\nfeelings of loneliness increased with age at both dates, that in all age\nT A B L E 2.

Table 2 shows that the reported feelings\nof loneliness varied by subgroup. The most vulnerable to loneliness were :\nthe divorced (49%), the never married (43%), those living alone (40%),\nthose who thought their relations with others were poor (45%), and\nthose who did not think their children were filial (46%).

These\nfigures confirm that living in rural areas, an advanced age, self-reported\npoor health, living alone, having nobody to talk with, poor social relations,\nand thinking that children are not filial were all independent contributors\nto the reported experience of loneliness.

The SSSE, although collected more than\n12 years ago, is among the very few sources of individual-level data that\nenable analysis of loneliness among older people in the country. There\nwere important differences in coverage and methodology of the SSSE and\nSAP. The 2000 SAP measured the frequency of loneliness by using the word\n\u2018often\u2019, whereas the 1992 SSSE survey investigated simply the presence\nof loneliness. Clearly, the 1992 question referred to the feeling at the time\nof the interview, while the 2000 question inquired about the state over a\nperiod. The revealed differences in the prevalence of loneliness in 1992\nand 2000 must be regarded as hypotheses not findings, and further study is\nrequired to establish whether the differentials are real or a function of the\ndifferent survey methodologies.\nThe same caution should also be applied when making comparisons\nbetween the findings from China and results from Britain and elsewhere.\nWhilst the Chinese respondents were invited to confirm the presence\n(or absence) of feelings of loneliness, western country surveys have asked\nrespondents to rate feelings of loneliness in terms of its frequency (as in\nGreat Britain, Australia and Scandinavia), and to answer questions that\nmake up composite scales (as in Australia and The Netherlands) (Victor\net al. 2005b). The absence of a time frame in the items of the Chinese\nsurveys meant that the respondents would have concentrated on their\nrecent experience, particularly in 1992. In other words, they reported\nfeelings of loneliness at or close to the time of the survey.\nThe prevalence of loneliness\nThe raw estimates suggest that the prevalence of loneliness among older\npeople in China was 15.6 per cent in 1992 and 29.6 per cent in 2000. A\nrecent study lends some support to the hypothesis that there has been an\nupward trend. Using data from the third wave in 2002 of the Chinese\nLongitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS), Zhang and Liu (2007)\n320 Keming Yang and Christina R. Victor\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.66\nexamined the effect of childlessness on older people\u2019s psychological well-\nbeing. The survey targeted those aged 65 or more years in 22 provinces\nand had a sample size of 13,447. Most relevant to our study was the\ninclusion of a question on loneliness, which was similar to that used in the\nSAP, \u2018Do you often feel lonely and isolated?5 The instrument was better\ndesigned than the SAP\u2019s because it offered four categories of responses :\n\u2018always and often\u2019, \u2018 sometimes\u2019, \u2018 seldom\u2019 and \u2018never \u2019. The percentages\nof the respondents that chose these categories were respectively 8.4, 24.2,\n30.3 and 37.1. If the first two categories are aggregated as an approxi-\nmation of positive answers in SAP, then the estimated prevalence of\nloneliness was 32.6 per cent in 2002, a level consistent with the estimate\n(29.6%) from the SAP in 2000 and with a rising trend (given that the\nrespondents in CLHLS were aged 65 or more, rather than 60 or more\nyears, and interviewed two years later).\nPutting the possibility of a rising temporal trend to one side, the avail-\nable evidence suggests that variations in loneliness among older people\nwere broadly similar in Britain, Australia and China at the turn of the\nmillennium: in all three countries approximately 60 per cent said that they\nwere not lonely. It has been found that the prevalence of severe (\u2018always \u2019\nor \u2018often\u2019) loneliness in the UK, North America, Australia and Saudi\nArabia is around seven per cent and that this has been quite stable for\nseveral decades (Victor et al. 2002). It is the intermediate categories of\nloneliness that vary over time and by whether self-rating or composite\nindicators are used. In this sense, the survey instrument used in the 2000\nSAP that included the qualifier \u2018often\u2019 has \u2018 face level \u2019 comparability with\nthe measures used in Great Britain and Australia, but the revealed\nprevalence of severe loneliness among older people in China was much\nhigher than in the economically more advanced countries.\nVariation in the prevalence of loneliness by sub-groups\nIn western societies, loneliness is not equally distributed across the older\npopulation, and at the univariate level of analysis it has statistically sig-\nnificant relationships with several demographic, health and social factors\n(Victor et al. 2005; De Jong Gierveld 2003), including gender (female), age\n(above 75 years), marital status (widowed), and living arrangement (living\nalone). These associations have been consistently shown over time and in\ndifferent settings (e.g. Iredell et al. 2003). More recent multivariate statistical\nanalyses have contested many of these relationships, however, especially\nthe links with age, gender, household size and health factors. Both Victor\net al. (2005a) andWenger et al. (1996) have developed multivariate statistical\nmodels of loneliness that confirmed the link with marital status and health\nLoneliness among older people in China 321\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.66\nratings but found no support for associations with increased age, living\nalone and gender.\nSome findings of the analysis reported here are consistent with the\nabove findings. Among older people in China, females, those of an ad-\nvanced age (85 or more years), and those without a spouse suffer from the\nhighest levels of feeling lonely, but there are two important differences\nfrom western patterns. First, the likelihood of feeling lonely among older\npeople in rural areas is significantly higher than among urban residents.\nSecondly, in western countries the relationships between loneliness among\nolder people and socio-demographic characteristics have been found quite\nstable, but in China these associations appeared to intensify between 1992\nand 2000.\nLoneliness and social relations\nBy definition, loneliness is an evaluation of a shortage of desirable social\nrelations with others. Studies of loneliness with an empirical focus in\nEurope, Australia and North America have usually identified the \u2018social\nsources \u2019 of loneliness as an unprotective marital status, the lack of con-\nfiding relationships, and much time spent alone (Victor et al. 2005; Wenger\net al. 1996). As the surveys in China did not include the amount of time\nalone, here we focus on the first two factors. It is worth pointing out that\nthe percentage of people aged 60 or more years who lived alone in China\nwas 0.12 per cent in 1992 and 6.6 per cent in 2000, much lower than the\napproximately one-in-three reported for contemporary western countries\n(Victor et al. 2005).\nA link between loneliness and widowhood has long been established\nin most countries. For older people in China, widowhood does have a\nstatistically significant and independent effect in raising the likelihood\nof loneliness, but unlike in western countries, divorce has a much greater\neffect. For Chinese elders, the termination of a marriage through an\nuntenable relationship seems to be a more powerful trigger of loneliness\nthan the death of one\u2019s spouse. Note, however, that the prevalence of\ndivorce among older people in China is very low: among those aged 60 or\nmore years, in 1992 only 0.76 per cent were divorced, and in 2000 only\n0.90 per cent. Being widowed is much more common (32.0% in 1992\nand 35.5% in 2000). Because both divorce and widowhood are triggers\nof loneliness and because more than one-third of older people in China\nare either divorced or widowed, it is not surprising that loneliness\nhas become common, and affects at least one-third of the Chinese older\npopulation. In short, marital status is a powerful predictor of loneliness\nin China.\n322 Keming Yang and Christina R. Victor\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.66\nIn addition, older people\u2019s relations with their children, which have not\nbeen given much attention in western studies of loneliness, have been\nshown to be of great importance. The difference comes partly from the\nChinese notion of filial piety. As Whyte and colleagues (2003) reported for\nthe City of Baoding, the requirement of being filial to their parents seems\nto have survived the torrent of economic reforms in China. The impli-\ncation for understanding the bases of loneliness in China is that, if older\nparents expect their children to be filial and for this to be expressed\nthrough various forms of care and respect, and if the expectation is not\nsatisfied adequately or at all, then a sense of loneliness develops. At both\nunivariate and multivariate levels of analysis, the belief that their children\nwere not being filial was a statistically significant risk factor of loneliness.\nThe SAP respondents were asked to rank their children\u2019s filiality using\nfour ordinal categories (\u2018very filial \u2019, \u2018filial \u2019, \u2018 fair \u2019 and \u2018not filial \u2019). The\nSSSE respondents were offered only two categories (\u2018filial \u2019 or \u2018not filial \u2019).\nIt should be clear that the \u2018not filial \u2019 responses are comparable because\nneither survey established the degree of a negative answer. The two surveys\nfound that the percentage of older people who thought that their children\nwere not filial was 3.2 per cent in 1992 and 1.6 per cent in 2000. If this\nindicates a real trend, the figures support the conclusion of the Baoding\nstudy that filial responsibility is robust despite China\u2019s rapid economic\ndevelopment.\nIn the UK, Victor et al. (2005a) found no statistical association between\nloneliness and levels of social contact or proximity to children, family or\nfriends, and suggested that the availability of a confiding relationship is\nmore important for health and social outcomes across the lifecourse \u2013 in\nother words, that it is the quality rather than the quantity of social\nrelations that shapes the chance of feeling lonely. Both SSSE and SAP\nwere not designed to measure either the frequency of contacts between\nolder parents and their children or their proximity to children, although\nboth surveys asked respondents whether they had someone to talk to and,\nif \u2018yes \u2019, who it was. In our view, these items can be used as approximate\nmeasures of a confiding relationship. The results show that the percentage\nof older people in China having someone to talk to was 73.3 per cent in\n1992 and 68.4 per cent in 2000, which may indicate a deterioration of the\nquality of older people\u2019s social relations. In addition, having such a con-\nfiding relationship significantly predicted a lower likelihood of loneliness\nin China in 1992 (see Table 5). That fewer older people had confiding\nrelationships in 2000 could help explain the increase in the percentage of\nolder people feeling lonely in that year, although further studies would\nbe needed to confirm this hypothesis. Finally, in 1992, respondents were\nasked to whom they talked if they had at least one confiding relationship\nLoneliness among older people in China 323\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.66\n(the question was omitted from the 2000 survey). It turns out that the\nspouse was most frequently identified (47.7%) by older respondents,\nfollowed by a daughter (26.3%), a son (19.6%), and friends and neighbours\n(10.2%). Note that only 6.8 per cent of respondents in SSSE reported\na confiding relationship with their daughter-in-law (a son\u2019s wife) and 3.1\nper cent with their son-in-law (a daughter\u2019s husband). Consistent with a\nprevious finding, this suggests a process for the effect of marital status on\nloneliness \u2013 divorce or the loss of spouse takes away a confiding relation-\nship, which is crucial in reducing the vulnerability of older people to\nloneliness.\nConclusions\nStudies of loneliness in later life and, more broadly, of social exclusion and\nsocial relationships, rarely have an explicit cross-national dimension.\nWhen such studies have been undertaken, they typically have compared\nwestern societies (Victor et al. 2005b). This analysis has examined the\nextent of loneliness and the risk factors amongst Chinese elders using a\ncombination of secondary analyses of existing data and evidence from\npublished studies. It has drawn tentative comparisons with recently\npublished data from Great Britain, Europe and Australia ; these should\nstrictly be regarded as hypotheses requiring further investigation. The\nresults suggest that rates of loneliness, as defined inclusively, may be\nincreasing in China in response to social and economic changes. The\nconsistent importance of marriage across societies as a protection against\nloneliness has been shown. The results are intriguing and raise various\ntopics for further research that will require, among other things, longi-\ntudinal studies of social relationships in China, the development of \u2018 life-\ncourse \u2019 perspectives on loneliness, and measures of concepts of loneliness\nthat are methodologically robust and meaningful in diverse social and\ncultural contexts.\nAcknowledgements\nFirst and foremost, we are grateful for the very helpful comments and suggestions\nmade by the editor, Tony Warnes, and by two anonymous reviewers.
