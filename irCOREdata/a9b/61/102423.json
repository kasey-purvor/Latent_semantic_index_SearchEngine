For example, in excimer laser kerate-\nctomy, the control of the laser duration is essential in de-\ntermining the amount of ablation of the cornea tissues.\nSimilarly, the temporal characteristics of the laser pulse are\nvital in applications such as shadowgraphy, schlieren pho-\ntography, microlithography, and micromachining.\nGenerally speaking, there are two ways to control the\nstability of the output beam of a laser system. The first\napproach uses scientific means to examine the properties of\nthe system and compensate the errors by redesigning or\nmodifying system parameters analytically. The second ap-\nproach recognizes the difficulty in deriving a mathematical\nformula to relate all the parameters causing the variations,\nand introduces engineering control techniques such as the\nconventional PID (proportional1integral1derivative) con-\ntrol, expert systems, and computational intelligence to\nachieve system stability. The PID technique is simple to\nimplement but does not work well for multiinput multiout-\nput ~MIMO! systems. Moreover, the system parameters\nmust be fine-tuned for different set points. Expert systems\nare heuristic in nature and require extensive adjustments for\nquantitative control. Computational intelligence\u2014which\nencompasses artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, neuro-\nfuzzy, fuzzy-neural, and genetic algorithms\u2014are very\npromising candidates in achieving stable control of MIMO\nsystems1\u20135.\nIn this paper, we report on the results of implementing a\nfuzzy logic controller on an experimental nitrogen laser.\nThe performance of the fuzzy logic controller is comparedOpt. Eng. 40(2) 237\u2013244 (February 2001) 0091-3286\/2001\/$15.00with that obtained for free-running operation and that ob-\ntained with a two-channel PID controller.\n2 Experimental Setup\nThe discharge circuit for the experimental laser is of the\nconventional Blumlein design modified by the on-demand\npulse charging technique developed by Lee et al.6 The dis-\ncharge voltage operates from 9.0 to 11.1 kV, and the nitro-\ngen pressure can be varied from 250 mbar to 1.0 bar. For\nconvenience of 8-bit numerical control from a PC, each of\nthe discharge voltage (V) and nitrogen pressure ~P! is nor-\nmalized to a range of 0 to 255, respectively. A schematic\ndiagram showing the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1.\nThe low-inductance parallel plate capacitors C1 and C2\nare charged by the high-voltage circuit. The trigger delay is\nused to set the discharge voltage at the desired level within\nthe range of 9.0 to 11.1 kV. The pressure of the nitrogen\ngas that flows into the laser head is controlled by a SMC\nIT209-202 electrovacuum regulator.\nThe output beam from the N2 laser is split into two paths\nfor simultaneous measurements of pulse energy and pulse\nwidth. The pulse energy is measured with a Molectron J-25\npyroelectric detector connected to a Molectron EM500 en-\nergy meter.\nThe digital signal bearing the energy content of the pulse\nis sent to the PC controller via a RS232 link. The pulse\nwidth is measured with a MG 13DAH 001 photodiode. The\nsignal is relayed to and displayed on an HP 54270D real-\ntime oscilloscope that has a sampling rate of 8 gigasamples\/\nsecond ~GSa\/s!. The oscilloscope is linked to the PC con-\ntroller via a general purpose interface bus ~GPIB!\ninterface.7237\u00a9 2001 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers\nTam et al.: Fuzzy logic control of a nitrogen laserThe fuzzy logic controller is implemented using the\nMATLAB\u00ae Fuzzy Logic Toolbox executed from the PC.\nThe controller adjusts the discharge voltage (V) and nitro-\ngen pressure ~P! by monitoring the actual energy output ~E!\nand pulse width ~PW! to achieve set-point equilibrium. An\ninterface card was built for this purpose, although any com-\nmercial general-purpose I\/O card can be used.\n3 Fuzzy Logic Controller\nFuzzy logic is a computational technique that enables the\nsolving of model-based design problems using both intu-\nition and heuristics. It enables the representation of system\nbehavior without the need for vigorous mathematical sys-\ntem modeling. Figure 2 shows a block diagram of the fuzzy\nlogic controller that was implemented for the nitrogen la-\nser.\nThe desired targets for pulse energy (E0) and pulse\nwidth (PW0), were input to the fuzzy logic controller. The\ncontroller generates digitized outputs to control the dis-\ncharge voltage (V) and nitrogen pressure ~P!, which are\nused to operate the nitrogen laser.\nTwo membership functions were employed in the fuzzy\nlogic controller. The input membership function was for-\nmulated based on the error signal expressed as a percentage\nof the desired signal and was used to fuzzify the measured\npulse energy and pulse width into suitable linguistic vari-\nables. The output membership function was modeled on the\nfuzzy control ~if-then! rules, and output crisp adjustments\nin voltage (DV) and pressure (DP) that stabilize the laser\npulse energy and pulse width simultaneously. A detailed\ndiscussion of the implementation of the fuzzy logic control-\nler is provided in Sec. 5.\nThe fuzzy if-then rules were formulated by recording the\nfield data collected by firing the laser at different voltage\nand pressure settings. Ten readings were collected for each\ncombination of voltage and pressure setting, and the aver-\nage values are plotted in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively. We\nFig. 1 Schematic of the control loop.\nFig. 2 Fuzzy logic controller.238 Optical Engineering, Vol. 40 No. 2, February 2001observe that the voltage has a higher impact on the output\nenergy, while pressure has a higher impact on the pulse\nwidth.\nInterpreting the fuzzy if-then rules involves distinct\nparts: first evaluating the antecedent ~which involves fuzzi-\nfying the input and applying fuzzy operators!, and second\napplying that result to the consequence ~known as implica-\ntion!. The consequence specifies a fuzzy set to be assigned\nto the output. The implication function then modifies that\nfuzzy set to the degree specified by the antecedent.\nFinally, the outputs, steps change in voltage (DV) and\npressure (DP) after defuzzification, are obtained. These\nchanges are added to the (V ,P) settings used in the previ-\nous firing sequence. Defuzzification is defined as a map-\nping from a space of fuzzy control actions to a space of\ncrisp control action. The defuzzification is based on the\ncenter-of-area ~COA! method and adjusts the voltage and\npressure settings for the next firing instance. The defuzzi-\nfication based on COA is given by\nZCOA5\n* zmc8~z !z dz\n* zmc8~z ! dz\n, ~1!\nFig. 3 Pulse energy versus pressure for different discharge volt-\nages.\nFig. 4 Pulse width versus pressure for different discharge voltages.\nTam et al.: Fuzzy logic control of a nitrogen laserwhere mc8(z) is the membership function of the conse-\nquence after implication. In this work, the Mandami impli-\ncation method was used.3\n4 Implementation of a PID Controller\nThe PID controller is a well-established control scheme. It\nhas also been implemented to benchmark the performance\nof the fuzzy logic controller. The discrete-time PID model\nis given by\nuk5Kpek1\n1\n2 KiDT@e012e112e21fl12ek221ek21#\n1\nKd\nDT ~ek2ek21!, ~2!\nwhere uk is the control action at the k\u2019th step, ek is the error\nbetween the actual output and the desired output at the k\u2019th\nstep, and DT is the time interval. We can assume that DT\n51, as its numerical value will not affect the actual system\nperformance. The three terms Kp , Ki , and Kd determine\nthe proportional gain, steady state error, and the response\ntime to a fast changing input, respectively.\nTwo versions of the PID control algorithm were devel-\noped. In the first one, we assumed that there is no correla-\ntion between discharge voltage and pulse width, and be-\ntween gas pressure and pulse energy. This assumption led\nto an independent two-channel two-variable PID control\nscheme. The block diagram for this configuration is shown\nin Fig. 5. The values of Kp , Ki , and Kd are derived ap-\nproximately from Figs. 3 and 4 at the settings of E0\n50.25 mJ and PW051.90 ns.\nIn the second PID scheme, the correlations between the\ntwo input and output variables were taken into consider-\nation. A coupled PID scheme was developed.4 However,\nwe did not obtain any conclusive results as steady state\nstability cannot be reached for different sets of operating\nparameters.\n5 Implementation of a Fuzzy Logic Controller\nThe fuzzy logic controller was implemented using the\nMATLAB toolkit. The use of MATLAB toolkit facilitates\nexperimentation using different membership functions in\nthe control scheme, as the toolkit includes many types of\nbuilt-in membership, functions that include the triangular\nfunction; the trapezoidal function; the Gaussian curve, the\nFig. 5 Block diagram of two-channel PID controller.bell function; the sigmoidal function; and the Z, S, and pi\nfunctions. As this is an experimental project that seeks to\ncompare the practical effectiveness of using fuzzy logic in\nlaser control, the MATLAB toolkit provides the flexibility\nand the ease of trying out different control schemes. Fur-\nthermore, the use of a standard software for parameter op-\ntimization is not restrictive, as MATLAB enables the gen-\neration of C-codes, so that a well-chosen fuzzy control\nalgorithm can be implemented as a stand-alone executable\nprogram.\nIn general, fuzzy logic control could provide robust\nnonlinear control over the performance of a system through\nthe selection of various input and output membership func-\ntions and the implementation of the fuzzy if-then rules.\nUsually, a composite three-class or a five-class membership\nfunction could yield reasonably good results in terms of\ncorrection range and system stability. In this project, the\nfollowing five fuzzy logic ~FL! control schemes were at-\ntempted:\n1. Scheme FL1: a Z-function, three triangular functions,\nand an S function are used for both the energy control\nand pulse width control.\n2. Scheme FL2: this is similar to scheme FL1, but with\nslight variations in the output membership functions.\n3. Scheme FL3: this is similar to scheme FL1, but with\ndifferent output membership functions.\n4. Scheme FL4: a Z function, two Gaussian functions, a\ntriangular function, and a S function are employed.\n5. Scheme FL5: this is similar to scheme FL3, but with\na different range for the input variable energy\n\u2013\nerr.\nThe input membership functions for the various schemes\nare shown in Fig. 6, while the output membership functions\nare illustrated in Fig. 7. In these diagrams, the energy and\npulse width error signals are represented by \u2018\u2018energy\n\u2013\nerr\u2019\u2019\nand \u2018\u2018pulse\n\u2013\nerr,\u2019\u2019 respectively. The compensation output\nsignals are given by \u2018\u2018delvoltage\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018delpressure,\u2019\u2019 re-\nspectively.\nFigure 8 shows the surface plots generated. The shape of\nthe plots illustrates the incremented variations in the two\noutput variables ~delvoltage, delpressure! versus the varia-\ntions in the two input variables ~energy\n\u2013\nerr and pulse\n\u2013\nerr!.\nNote that the surface plots correspond to the trends shown\nin Figs. 3 and 4. Thus, the use of different membership\nfunctions would enable a user to tailor the response graphs\nto the characteristic response of the system. Furthermore,\nthe fuzzy logic controller allows for corrections in nonlin-\nearities that are due to transducer response, measurement\nerrors, environmental variations, etc. Using the preceding\nobservations, the following 10 fuzzy if-then rules are for-\nmulated:\n1. If ~energy\n\u2013\nerr is \u2018\u2018negative large\u2019\u2019!, then ~delvoltage\nis \u2018\u2018decrease more\u2019\u2019!.\n2.

From the experimental results ob-\ntained, it was found that scheme FL5 gave rise to the best\nTam et al.: Fuzzy logic control of a nitrogen laserFig. 7 Output membership functions for various schemes.performance. Hence scheme FL5 was implemented as the\nfuzzy logic controller for further comparisons.\n6 Results and Discussion\nThe open-loop response of the nitrogen laser was used as\nthe baseline reference. The temporal response for 4000 la-\nser pulses, at a normalized discharge voltage of 220 and a\nnormalized nitrogen pressure of 130, and at a firing rate of\n5 s\/pulse, was recorded, as shown in Fig. 9. The average\npulse energy and pulse width are 0.25 mJ and 1.97 ns,\nrespectively. The root mean squared ~rms! instability forthe pulse energy ~E! is 1.82%, and that for the pulse width\n~PW! is 4.58%. By taking the moving average of 20 con-\nsecutive pulses over the 4000 pulses recorded, the long-\nterm drift was determined. It was found that the pulse en-\nergy drifts by 6.97% and the pulse width drifts by 6.63%.\nThe equations used for these calculations are\naccuracy5S 12 ux% 2TuT D3100%, ~3!\n241Optical Engineering, Vol. 40 No. 2, February 2001\nTam et al.: Fuzzy logic control of a nitrogen laser\n242 Optical EngiFig. 8 Surface plots for various schemes.rms5\n1\nx% F(~x2x% !\n2\nN G\n1\/2\n3100%, ~4!\nmax drift deviation5\nx\u00afmax2 x\u00afmin\nx%\n3100%, ~5!neering, Vol. 40 No. 2, February 2001where T is the desired set-point target; x is the value of an\nindividual reading; x% is the grand average; x\u00af is the running\naverage over 20 pulses; and x\u00afmax and x\u00afmin are the maximum\nand minimum values of x\u00af over the 4000 recorded pulses,\nrespectively.\nTam et al.: Fuzzy logic control of a nitrogen laserFig. 9 Open-loop response.\nFig. 10 Response using two-channel PID controller.Fig. 11 Response using fuzzy logic controller.\nFig. 12 The rms performance variation between 200, 1000 and\n4000 shots.Table 1 Summary of results (E050.25 mJ, PW051.90 ns).\nControl Scheme\nEnergy (mJ) Pulse Width (ns)\nAccuracy (%) rms Deviation (%) Max.

However, for every input setting, the\nuser must fine-tune the control parameters extensively\nto achieve substantial output stability, and the same\nvalues of the control parameters cannot be reused once\nthe input settings are changed. The fuzzy logic controller\ngives overall improve-ments when compared to theopen-loop system. The rms instability for the pulse\nenergy improves from 1.82 to 1.02%, and that for the\npulse width also improves from 4.58 to 4.24%. The drift\nin pulse energy improves from 6.97 to 2.28% and that\nfor the pulse width improves from 6.63 to 3.88%.\nThe changes in the system performances from 200 shots\n~short term! to 1000 shots ~medium term! and finally to\n4000 shots ~long term! for the various schemes are shown\nin Fig. 12.\nThe performance of the fuzzy logic controller can be\nfurther enhanced if a learning scheme ~also known as a243Optical Engineering, Vol. 40 No. 2, February 2001\nTam et al.: Fuzzy logic control of a nitrogen lasersupervisor or a critic! is introduced, e.g., using a neuro-\nfuzzy control algorithm.3\n7 Conclusions\nIn this project, we have achieved the following results:\nFirst, closed-loop nitrogen laser was successfully con-\nstructed that operates within a voltage range of 9.0 to 11.1\nkV, and a pressure range of 250 mbar to 1.0 bar. Second,\nclosed-loop controllers were successfully implemented into\nthe system. Feedback measurements on pulse energy and\npulse width were used to fine-tune the operating discharge\nvoltage and nitrogen pressure. Third, five different schemes\nof fuzzy logic control have been implemented and tested,\nand scheme FL5 gave the best results. Fourth, the results\nshow that the PID controller and the fuzzy logic controller\nare able to track the outputs to the required targets very\nsuccessfully. The performance of an FL controller was cor-\nrelated to the surface plots. Finally, the fuzzy logic control-\nler performed better than the PID controller in maintaining\nbeam stability. Stability of the output pulse energy at\n1.02% and that for the output pulse width at 4.24% were\nobtained simultaneously.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank Mr. Song-Lip Lim and Mr.\nKok-Tiong Goh for technical assistance, Dr. Duncan\nCampbell of La Trobe University, Australia, for technical\ndiscussions, and the Nanyang Technological University for\nfunding this research project.\nReferences\n1.
