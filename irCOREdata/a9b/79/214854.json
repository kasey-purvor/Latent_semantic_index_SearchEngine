At a second, more reflective level, however, there remains some doubt whether \na political constitution purports to be a descriptive or normative account of a real world \nconstitution, such as Britain\u2019s. By exploring the idea of a political constitution as differently \narticulated by J.A.G. Griffith, Adam Tomkins and Richard Bellamy, this essay explores why \nthe normativity of a political constitution may be indistinct and ill-defined, and how \ncompelling reasons for this indistinctness and ill-definition are to be found in the very idea of \na political constitution itself. A political constitution is here conceived as a \u2018model\u2019 which \nsupplies an explanatory framework within which to make sense of our constitutional self-\nunderstandings. The discipline of thinking in terms of a model opens up a critical space \nwherein there need not be some stark, all-encompassing choice between constitutional \nmodels, which, in turn, allows for more subtle understandings of Britain\u2019s constitution as \nneither exclusively \u2018political\u2019 nor \u2018legal\u2019. \n \n \n1.  Introduction \n \nTo inquire \u2018what is a political constitution?\u2019 is to pose a beguilingly simple question. It is true, \nof course, that the idea of a political constitution\u2014one that is associated with holding those \nwho exercise political power to account, for the most part, through political processes and in \npolitical institutions\u2014has long since melted into the landscape of constitutional thought, at \nleast in Britain. It is commonplace, after all, for textbooks and articles to juxtapose the idea of \na political constitution with that of a legal constitution, the latter being associated with holding \nthose exercising political power to account, to a substantial and increasing extent, through \njudicial review. It is also commonplace to suggest that Britain\u2019s constitution is slowly evolving \naway from a political constitution towards something more akin to a legal constitution. Yet, at \nthe same time, our question\u2014what is a political constitution?\u2014is not so easily answered. For \nthe question itself seems incomplete. As H.L.A. Hart remarked in 1953, \u2018what is . . .\u2019 questions \n\u2018have great ambiguity\u2019 insofar as \u2018the same form of words may be used to demand a definition \nor the cause or the purpose or the justification or the origin of a legal or political institution\u2019.1 \nWithout more, the question is not situated in time, place, or perspective. To leave such matters \nunspecified neglects the potential for the political constitution to lend, explicitly or otherwise, \nsomething important to the constitutional self-understandings of a great variety of different \npeople, in different places, at different times, and in different ways across the history of \nconstitutional thought. Or, differently put: it is possible to pursue our question in any number \nof directions.  \n                                                 \n* Lecturer in Law, Birmingham Law School, University of Birmingham, email: G.D.S.Gee@bham.ac.uk. \n** Lecturer in Law, Department of Law, London School of Economics and Political Science, email: \nG.Webber@lse.ac.uk. We are grateful to our colleagues for generous comments on previous drafts. \n1 HLA Hart, \u2018Definition and Theory in Jurisprudence\u2019 [1953] in his Essays in Jurisprudence and Philosophy \n(OUP, New York 1983) 21.  \n 2 \n \nOur answer to the question\u2014what is a political constitution?\u2014will seek to explain why \nthe political constitution continues to bring something important to the constitutional self-\nunderstandings of public lawyers in Britain at the very time when the British constitution is \nsaid to be evolving towards a legal constitution. This more focused question could be taken to \ninvite an inquiry into the commitments, arguments and assumptions shared by most \nproponents of a political constitution; assumptions, for example, about the nature, content and \nworkings of a real world constitution, such as Britain\u2019s, or the proper role of political and \njudicial institutions therein. But this question could also invite a more reflective inquiry into \nwhat the idea of a political constitution purports to be; for example, does it purport to describe \nBritain\u2019s constitution or to make normative sense of it? In this essay, we address our question \nin these more reflective terms, and for the following reasons. Today, the commitments, \narguments and assumptions\u2014in short, the claims\u2014shared by most proponents of a political \nconstitution seem fairly settled. In the thirty years since J.A.G. Griffith\u2019s lecture on \u2018The \nPolitical Constitution\u2019,2 and from which point it seems reasonable to trace the modern \ndevelopment of political constitutionalist thought,3 the articulation of the claims that inform \nand underpin a political constitution has achieved a certain completeness\u2014and amongst its \nproponents at least, a certain acceptability. The same is not true, however, of efforts to make \nsense of the political constitution at a more reflective level. In truth, there has been little \nreflection on what students of the British constitution imagine themselves as doing (or for that \nmatter what they succeed in doing) when they appeal to, and talk in terms of, a political \nconstitution.4  \n \nMore particularly, there remains some doubt whether proponents of a political \nconstitution imagine themselves as engaged in a largely descriptive or normative enterprise, or \nperhaps an uncertain mix of the two. It is notable, for instance, that while Griffith spoke of \nBritish\u2019s political constitution in largely descriptive terms, Adam Tomkins and Richard \nBellamy have each more recently envisaged the idea of a political constitution in explicitly, \nself-consciously normative terms.5 Whereas Griffith seemed to deny normative content to the \nidea of a political constitution or, indeed, to deny the status of a political constitution as an \nidea at all, envisaging it instead as a reading of prevailing practices in the British political \nsystem, Tomkins and Bellamy have each argued that the idea of a political constitution can be \nconceived separately from any real world constitution as one that is informed and underpinned \nby republican norms. In this essay, we explore why some seem to envisage the idea of a \npolitical constitution in largely descriptive terms, yet others do so in plainly normative terms. \nIn doing so, we consider whether there is something inherent in the very idea of a political \nconstitution which invites, and possibly even demands, ambiguity about its precise normative \n                                                 \n2 JAG Griffith, \u2018The Political Constitution\u2019 (1979) 42 MLR 1-21. \n3 For a brief discussion of the development of something akin to the idea of a political constitution in the work of \nHarold Laski and Ivor Jennings, and the subsequent and explicit development of this idea by Griffith, see \nMichael Foley, The Politics of the British Constitution (Manchester University Press, Manchester 1999) 30-37. \nFor some, the classic work on the idea of a political constitution is Walter Bagehot, The English Constitution \n[1867] (Collins, London 1963). See generally Martin Loughlin, Swords & Scales: An Examination of the \nRelationship of Law & Politics (Hart, Oxford 2000) 4; and Adam Tomkins, \u2018The Republican Monarchy \nRevisited\u2019 (2002) 19 Constitutional Commentary 737-760. \n4 Often appeals are made to \u2018the political constitution\u2019 and \u2018a political constitution\u2019, testifying to some ambiguity \nas to the ambition of those who talk and think in these terms. For now, we will generally employ the phrase, \u2018the \nidea of a political constitution\u2019 as a precursor to our claim, developed below, that a political constitution is best \nconceived as a model of the constitution. \n5 See Adam Tomkins, Our Republican Constitution (Hart, Oxford 2005); and Richard Bellamy, Political \nConstitutionalism: A Republican Defence of the Constitutionality of Democracy (CUP, Cambridge 2007). \n 3 \ncontent. In short, ours is an attempt to grapple with the indistinct and ill-defined normativity of \na political constitution.  \n \nIn doing so, we seek to respond to the challenge which, in our view, nowadays \nconfronts proponents of a political constitution in Britain. If, on the one hand, a political \nconstitution is no more than a predominantly descriptive account of constitutional practices, \nthere is an argument that it no longer accurately describes\u2014if it ever did\u2014the nature, content \nand workings of the British constitution. If, on the other hand, a political constitution is a \npredominantly normative idea, there is an argument that it no longer supplies\u2014if it ever did\u2014\nan attractive account upon which to organize the British constitution. In this essay, we explore \nwhy responses to this challenge must begin by recognizing that the normativity of a political \nconstitution is indistinct and ill-defined, but that compelling reasons for this indistinctness and \nill-definition can be found within the political constitution itself. In our view, only by \ngrappling with its indistinct and ill-defined normativity will we be able to grasp what the idea \nof political constitution purports to be and, in turn, to understand its continued relevance to \nwhat many take to be Britain\u2019s changing constitution. In doing so, we develop below the claim \nthat a political constitution is best conceived as a constitutional model which oscillates \nbetween the descriptive and the normative.  \n \nWe approach our study of the political constitution in a more or less unorthodox \nfashion. For one of the distinguishing features of much political constitutionalist scholarship \nis the extent to which its proponents engage with legal constitutionalists, such as Ronald \nDworkin, T.R.S. Allan and Sir John Laws, but not with each other.6 Indeed, it can sometimes \nseem as if, for many of its proponents, a political constitution is defined by the array of \ncontrasts that can be drawn with a legal constitution, with much effort being made to rebut the \nchallenges that appear to be posed to a political constitution by its legal counterpart. More \nemphasis tends to be placed on making sense of a political constitution obliquely, in terms of \nwhat it differs from, rather than in terms of its own possibilities. There may be good reasons \nfor seeking to explain a political constitution (or any complex idea) in this way. It might even \nbe difficult to make sense of the political constitution without, to some degree, bringing into \nperspective the idea of a legal constitution. In this essay, however, we engage more directly \nwith the idea of a political constitution itself. Consequently we devote comparatively little \nattention to the nature, content and workings of a legal constitution.7 Instead, our focus is on \nthe idea of a political constitution as it has been differently articulated over the last thirty \nyears or so by Griffith, Tomkins and Bellamy. We begin by considering Professor Griffith\u2019s \nlecture on \u2018The Political Constitution\u2019. This lecture expressed, albeit in ways that are \nexaggerated in places, the claims today shared by most proponents of a political constitution \nin Britain. More importantly for our purposes, Griffith\u2019s lecture is interesting insofar as it \nseemed to envisage the political constitution in terms which were largely, if not at times \nexclusively, descriptive of prevailing constitutional arrangements.  \n                                                 \n6 While many proponents of a legal constitution draw on, or at least seem to be inspired by, the writings of \nRonald Dworkin, the leading proponents in Britain of the model of a legal constitution are TRS Allan and John \nLaws: see TRS Allan, Law, Liberty and Justice: The Legal Foundations of British Constitutionalism (Clarendon, \nOxford 1993); TRS Allan, Constitutional Justice: A Liberal Theory of the Rule of Law (OUP, Oxford 2001); \nJohn Laws, \u2018Law and Democracy\u2019 [1995] PL 72-93; and John Laws, \u2018The Constitution, Morals and Rights\u2019 \n[1996] PL 622-635.  \n7 For critiques of the legal constitutionalist approach, and particularly the work of TRS Allan, see Thomas Poole, \n\u2018Dogmatic Liberalism? T.R.S. Allan and the Common Law Constitution?\u2019 (2002) 65 MLR 463-475; Thomas \nPoole \u2018Back to the Future? Unearthing the Theory of Common Law Constitutionalism\u2019 (2003) 23 OJLS 435-\n454; and Thomas Poole, \u2018Questioning Common Law Constitutionalism\u2019 (2005) 25 LS 142-163.  \n 4 \n \n2. The Descriptivism of Griffith\u2019s Political Constitution \n \nProfessor Griffith chose as the title for the Chorley Lecture of 1978, \u2018The Political \nConstitution\u2019,8 but in neither the lecture itself nor his writings more generally did Griffith \npurport to grapple with the question \u2018what is a political constitution?\u2019, perhaps because he \nnever conceived of it as anything distinct or separate from the British constitution itself. \nRather, Griffith\u2019s contribution was to offer what was, in 1978, a novel account of Britain\u2019s \nconstitutional arrangements\u2014and for some a faintly disturbing account\u2014of what he took to \nbe the distinctively political character of the constitution. Through this, Griffith lay the \nfoundations for the emergence of the idea of a political constitution as a fresh and provocative \nway of thinking and talking about the British constitution. To be clear, the novelty of his \nlecture lay less in making claims not found in his previous scholarship or in describing the \nBritish constitution as distinctively political; rather, the novelty was in bringing claims (and \naphorisms) present in his earlier scholarship together into a reading of the British constitution \nthat was political inasmuch as it was characterized by conflict, disagreement, messiness, and \nchaos\u2014a reading that was fresh, provocative, even unsettling for some. \n \nGriffith\u2019s lecture set out the sort of relentless critique of a bill of rights which is today \ndistinctive of much political constitutionalist scholarship. More particularly, Griffith\u2019s lecture \nwas a critique of bills of rights of the sort that generate judicially enforceable limits on the \nlegislature.9 This critique relied on two broad categories of objection, which he labelled the \n\u2018philosophical\u2019 and \u2018political\u2019.10 The philosophical objection reflected Griffith\u2019s rejection of \nany approach to constitutional matters that was focused on, and formulated in terms of, \n\u2018rights\u2019. For Griffith, there was no such thing as \u2018rights\u2019, but rather \u2018political claims by \nindividuals and groups\u2019.11 There is, Griffith suggested, \u2018a continuous struggle between the \nrulers and the ruled about the size and shape of these claims\u2019, and that \u2018struggle is political \nthroughout\u2019.12 This led Griffith to stress the importance of cultivating \u2018situations in which \ngroups of individuals may make their political claims and thus seek to persuade governments \nto accept them\u2019.13 Griffith\u2019s political objection reflected his belief that law is neither separate \nfrom nor superior to politics, but is itself a form of political discourse. \u2018Law\u2019, Griffith wrote, \n\u2018is not and cannot be a substitute for politics\u2019.14 Therefore, insofar as politics is \u2018what happens \nin the continuance or resolution of conflicts\u2019, law is no more than \u2018one means, one process, by \nwhich those conflicts are continued or may be temporarily resolved\u2019.15 Or, as Griffith put it in \na later article, \u2018law is politics carried on by other means\u2019.16  \n                                                 \n8 For three recent re-interpretations of this lecture, see Carol Harlow, \u2018The Political Constitution Reworked\u2019 in \nRick Bigwood (ed), Public Interest Litigation: New Zealand Experience in International Perspective \n(LexisNexis, Wellington 2006) 189; Thomas Poole, \u2018Tilting at Windmills? Truth and Illusion in the Political \nConstitution\u2019 (2007) MLR 250-277; and Graham Gee, \u2018The Political Constitutionalism of J.A.G. Griffith\u2019 (2008) \n28 LS 20-45. \n9 Griffith presented the lecture as a response to three books published in the 1970s: Lord Hailsham, The Dilemma \nof Democracy: Diagnosis and Prescription (Collins, London 1978); Lord Scarman, English Law\u2014The New \nDimensions (Stevens, London 1974); and Ronald Dworkin, Taking Rights Seriously (Duckworth, London 1977). \n10 See Griffith (n 2) at 12.  \n11 Ibid 17. \n12 Ibid 17-18. \n13 Ibid 18. \n14 Ibid 16. \n15 Ibid 20. \n16 JAG Griffith, \u2018The Common Law and the Political Constitution\u2019 (2001) 117 LQR 42-67, 64. \n 5 \n \nTogether, these two objections led Griffith to argue that bills of rights should be \navoided. For Griffith, rights, and the principles that are said to find expression in them, cannot \nbe guidelines for legislative or administrative activity since rights and principles, in their \napplication to specific situations, are \u2018the very questions which divide not unify opinion\u2019.17 \nThe fact that the framers of bills of rights are ingenious in crafting abstract formulations under \nthe rubric of rights should not conceal what are in truth political claims. It followed, for \nGriffith, that judicial adjudication of political claims passes \u2018political decisions out of the \nhands of politicians and into the hands of judges\u2019.18 Thus, bills of rights do not resolve \npolitical claims, but shift them into disputes about the meaning of the legal language of the \nbill of rights, with these disputes ultimately falling to be decided by judges. This, in turn, \noffended Griffith\u2019s conviction that \u2018political decisions should be taken by politicians\u2019.19 From \nGriffith\u2019s viewpoint, political decisions should be taken by politicians not because politicians \nare more likely to arrive at some uniquely correct answer, but because they are removable \nevery few years at the ballot box and are accountable to Parliament in the meantime. This led \nGriffith to contend that \u2018the responsibility and accountability of our rulers should be real and \nnot fictitious\u2019.20 While Griffith acknowledged that mechanisms of political accountability \nsuch as ministerial responsibility did not always operate as effectively as might be hoped, he \nmaintained that \u2018the remedies are political\u2019,21 by which he meant that proposals for reform \nshould focus not on a bill of rights which would limit Parliament\u2019s ability to legislate, but on \nmeasures which would enhance Parliament\u2019s ability to hold ministers, and others who \nexercise political power, to account.22  \n \nIn crafting this critique of bills of rights, and in linking this critique to Britain\u2019s \nreliance on mechanisms of political accountability, Griffith outlined his reading of Britain\u2019s \nconstitutional arrangements as they are and should be. While he did not offer anything akin to \na definition or summary of his use of the expression \u2018political constitution\u2019 and did not \nexplicitly refer to the rubric of \u2018a political constitution\u2019 in the text of his lecture itself, it seems \nto us that there are four claims which combined to delineate Griffith\u2019s reading of a political \nconstitution; claims which today, more than thirty years on, tend to be repeated, albeit often \nwith a greater degree of theoretical sophistication, by most political constitutionalists in \nBritain. First, there is no sharp distinction between law and politics.23 Second, law and \npolitics each respond to and are conditioned by \u2018the conflict [which] is at the heart of modern \nsociety\u2019.24 Law and politics are to be understood by reference to what Jeremy Waldron has \ntermed \u2018the circumstances of politics\u2019, being \u2018a felt need among the members of a certain \ngroup for a common framework or decision or course of action on some matter, even in the \n                                                 \n17 Griffith (n 2) 20.

For evidence that political constitutionalists have today moved beyond the starkness of Griffith\u2019s claim \nto recognize that law and politics likely \u2018collide and combine in a dazzling variety of (not always compatible) \nways\u2019: see, eg, Adam Tomkins, \u2018In Defence of the Political Constitution\u2019 (2002) 22 OJLS 157-75, 169. \n24 Griffith (n 2) 2. \n 6 \nface of disagreement about what that framework, decision or action should be\u2019.25 Third, \nbecause of the circumstances of politics, reasoning under the rubric of \u2018rights\u2019 should be \nemployed with caution, since there will likely be disagreement about which so-called \u2018rights\u2019 \nto recognize, how \u2018rights\u2019 apply to concrete cases, how best to realize such \u2018rights\u2019 and so \nforth. More pointedly put: arguments about what are contestable, political claims should be \nrecognized and labelled as such rather than paraded about as \u2018rights\u2019. Fourth, this account of \nthe relation between law and politics, together with a profound scepticism about rights-based \nreasoning, \u2018cannot encourage those who would embark on formal or written statements\u2019 such \nas a bill of rights to limit the political process, but suggests instead that \u2018the best [that] we can \ndo is enlarge the areas for argument and discussion\u201926 in the political process, including about \nthe nature and content of the constitution itself. Together, these four claims combined to map \nGriffith\u2019s reading of Britain\u2019s constitution as one which treats the constitution not as a \nframework of fundamental laws, but as a contingent response to the circumstances of politics \nthat is itself the subject of political debate, as well as liable to the possibility of change, even \nradical change, through the ordinary, day-to-day political process. \n \nGriffith\u2019s reading of Britain\u2019s constitutional arrangements as political through-and-\nthrough has found a sympathetic audience with modern day proponents of the political \nconstitution. It seems that for some, however, this sympathy has been tested by the \ndescriptivism (or, as we put it below, the apparent descriptivism) of Griffith\u2019s political \nconstitution.27 Despite Griffith\u2019s not infrequent appeal to the vocabulary of \u2018ought\u2019 (e.g., \n\u2018political decisions should be taken by politicians\u2019, \u2018the responsibility and accountability of \nour rulers should be real and not fictitious\u2019), some take his reading of Britain\u2019s constitution in \n1979 to deny that there are norms underpinning a political constitution, and, as a \nconsequence, no prescriptions deriving from it to guide the behaviour of ministers, members \nof Parliament, civil servants, law officers, judges and so forth.28 This apparent descriptivism \nis encapsulated in a passage in which Griffith wrote that Britain\u2019s constitution \u2018lives on, \nchanging from day to day for the constitution is no more and no less than what happens. \nEverything that happens is constitutional. And if nothing happened that would be \nconstitutional also\u2019.29 On one reading, this passage implies that there can be no norms \nunderpinning a political constitution inasmuch as a political constitution always remains \nsubject to the possibility of change\u2014significantly, any change\u2014through the ordinary political \nprocess. On this reading, in which there are no legal limits on the political process and no bill \nof rights to cabin day-to-day politics, everything and anything that happens is constitutional.  \n \n                                                 \n25 Jeremy Waldron, Law and Disagreement (OUP, Oxford 1999) 102.  \n26 Griffith (n 2) 20. \n27 For brief discussion of the \u2018descriptivism\u2019 of Griffith\u2019s model of a political constitution, see Dawn Oliver, \nConstitutional Reform in the UK (OUP, Oxford 2003) 21 (characterizing Griffith\u2019s idea of a political constitution \nas \u2018lacking normative content\u2019); and JWF Allison, The English Historical Constitution: Continuity, Change and \nEuropean Effects (CUP, Cambridge 2007) 34 (characterizing Griffith\u2019s political constitution as \u2018entirely \ndescriptive\u2014neither legally prescriptive nor morally normative\u2019). \n28 It would follow that, for Griffith, something like ministerial responsibility, which is a key component of most \nunderstandings of a political constitution, is not a constitutional requirement, but simply a prevailing practice in \nBritain\u2019s political constitution. If ministers refused to inform and explain their actions to Parliament, it would not \nbe apt, on this reading of Griffith\u2019s lecture, to talk of \u2018unconstitutionality\u2019, but rather to conclude that Britain\u2019s \npolitical constitution, which can of course be changed through the ordinary political process, would have simply \n\u2018changed again\u2019: JAG Griffith, \u2018Comment\u2019 [1963] PL 401-403, 402. According to this reading, it is not possible \nto argue that something in Britain\u2019s political constitution is \u2018unconstitutional\u2019, only that it is \u2018politically unwise \nor undesirable\u2019: JAG Griffith, \u2018The Brave New World of Sir John Laws\u2019 (2000) 63 MLR 159-76, 175. \n29 Griffith (n 2) 19. \n 7 \nOn a second (and, in our view, truer) reading, matters are rather more ambiguous. We \nconcede that Griffith appeared to deny normative content to a political constitution; indeed, \nthat he can be taken to deny that the political constitution can be conceived of as an \u2018idea\u2019 \nseparable from Britain\u2019s constitution. We also concede that one possible consequence of \nGriffith\u2019s failure to emphasize any normative content to the political constitution is that \nBritain\u2019s seeming shift towards the idea of a legal constitution could \u2018be presented as \njeopardizing nothing that is normatively valuable\u2019.30 At the same time, however, it is difficult \nto escape the conclusion that, for Griffith, Britain\u2019s political constitution exemplified a \u2018good\u2019 \nconstitution and to which normative weight ought to be attached. As Carol Harlow observes, \nGriffith\u2019s political constitution stands \u2018as a benchmark for those who see representative and \nparliamentary government as important constitutional desiderata\u2019.31 Indeed, perhaps above \nall, Griffith\u2019s lecture stands as a benchmark for those who recognize a critical, normatively \nsignificant link between the constitution and political activity, and where the constitution \nalways remains subject to the possibility of change through the sort of day-to-day politics \nwhich is associated with representative and parliamentary government. It may be, then, that \nGriffith\u2019s quip that Britain\u2019s constitution is no more and no less than what happens was \nmerely a reminder, in aphoristic form, that a constitution should always be subject to political \ndebate in, and the possibility of change through, the ordinary political process. If Griffith can \nbe taken as sketching his vision of a \u2018good\u2019 constitution\u2014or in terms that might be truer to his \napproach: as presenting the British constitution in a way that brings out its best components\u2014\nand if his suggestion that a constitution is no more and no less than what happens is taken as a \nstatement about the close relationship between a political constitution and day-to-day politics, \nGriffith can be said to have downplayed, but not denied, the normativity within\u2014indeed, the \nseparable idea of\u2014the political constitution.32 We return to this below. For now, we suggest \nthat if this reading is correct, the challenge for political constitutionalists would seem to be \ntwo-fold: first, to render explicit the normative content of a political constitution; and second, \nto account for why this normative content remained indistinct and ill-defined within Griffith\u2019s \nlecture. The first of these challenges is, it now seems, being met: for in an attempt to move \nbeyond the apparent descriptivism associated with Griffith\u2019s political constitution, and in \norder to render explicit what would be lost with any shift towards a legal constitution, recent \nscholarship on the idea of a political constitution has taken an explicitly \u2018normative turn\u2019.  \n \n3.   A Normative Turn \n \nThe turn evident in recent political constitutionalist scholarship renders explicit the normative \nqualities of day-to-day politics in real world constitutions, such as Britain\u2019s, with long \ntraditions of democracy and the rule of law. This \u2018turn\u2019\u2014spearheaded by public lawyer Adam \nTomkins and political theorist Richard Bellamy\u2014supplies a corrective to the vision of day-to-\nday politics commonly associated with legal constitutionalists, who often seem to cabin \npolitics for fear of its destructive potential. Legal constitutionalists sometimes present the \nvagaries of ordinary, everyday political life as potentially destructive of the rule of law and \nindividual rights and which, therefore, must be constrained by judicially enforceable \n                                                 \n30 Tomkins (n 5) at 40. \n31 Harlow (n 8) 190. \n32 Griffith (n 2) 15 (Griffith referred to reform proposals which \u2018would change the constitution at its very heart. \nThis heart is that the Governments of the United Kingdom may take any action necessary for the proper \ngovernment of the United Kingdom, as they see it, subject to two limitations. The first limitation is that they may \nnot infringe the legal rights of others unless expressly authorized to do so under statute or the prerogative. The \nsecond limitation is that if they wish to change the law, whether by adding to their existing legal powers or \notherwise, they must obtain the assent of Parliament\u2019). \n 8 \nconstitutional prescriptions. Instead, the normative turn in political constitutionalist writing \noffers an account of how politics serves as the \u2018vehicle\u201933 through which to realize these same \n(and other) ends. More particularly, the very aspects of day-to-day political life that \u2018many \nlegal and political theorists are apt to denigrate\u2014its adversarial and competitive qualities, its \nuse of compromise and majority rule to generate agreement, the role of political parties\u2014are \nthose\u2019 that political constitutionalists like Bellamy and Tomkins \u2018seek to praise\u2019.34 In doing \nso, the focus of this turn is not on an idealized form of political life, but rather\u2014much like \nGriffith\u2014on the actual day-to-day political life found in real world constitutions, with all of \nits imperfections and foibles. In what follows, we offer a sketch of the broad contours of this \nrecent scholarship in order to show how political constitutionalists have sought both to move \nbeyond the descriptivism associated with Griffith\u2019s reading of a political constitution and to \nelaborate on the link which Griffith alluded to between the constitution and day-to-day \npolitics.  \n \nSympathetic to the tenor of Griffith\u2019s commitment to political accountability, but \ncritical of his descriptive account, Tomkins has sought \u2018not to invent but to revive\u2019 the idea of \na political constitution by grounding it on basic norms of republican theory.35 Drawing on the \nscholarship of Quentin Skinner and Philip Pettit, Tomkins has identified non-domination, \npopular sovereignty, equality, open government and civic virtue as the basic norms that \ninform and underpin the idea of a political constitution.36 Extrapolating from these basic \nnorms to consider how republicanism might be instantiated in a real world constitution, \nTomkins has suggested that \u2018the centrepiece of a republican constitutional structure is \naccountability: those in positions of political power must be accountable to those over whom \n(and in whose name) such power is exercised\u2019.37 This, in turn, has prompted Tomkins to \nargue that a political constitution, with its emphasis on political accountability, embraces \nelements of a republican ideal. By pointing to ministerial responsibility as the \u2018simple\u2014and \nbeautiful\u2014rule\u201938 that resides at the heart of Britain\u2019s constitutional arrangements, Tomkins \nhas constructed a republican-inspired reading of what is, for him, Britain\u2019s political \nconstitution. For the most part, Tomkins\u2014in a manner that recalls Griffith\u2019s approach\u2014\ndraws out the primarily political character of the British constitution by interpreting \ncontemporary constitutional practices in ways that illuminate the continued relevance of \nministerial responsibility. In the face of the widespread belief that Parliament is seldom \neffective in holding ministers to account, Tomkins re-appraises the parliamentary record, \narguing that although ministerial responsibility is not always as effective as might be hoped, \n\u2018the system of political accountability is actually stronger now than it has been for some \nyears\u2019.39 \n \n                                                 \n33 Tomkins (n 5) 3. \n34 Bellamy (n 5) 210. \n35 Tomkins (n 5) vii.  \n36 See generally Quentin Skinner, Liberty before Liberalism (CUP, Cambridge 1998); Philip Pettit, \nRepublicanism: A Theory of Freedom and Government (OUP, Oxford 1997); and Philip Pettit, \u2018Keeping \nRepublican Freedom Simple: On a Difference with Quentin Skinner\u2019 (2002) 30 Political Theory 339. \n37 Tomkins (n 5) 64-65.  \n38 Ibid 1. \n39 Adam Tomkins, Public Law (Clarendon, Oxford 2003) 134. By stressing the continued relevance of \nministerial responsibility, he suggests that the constitution, in the absence of fundamental laws that are \nenforceable in the courts, is premised upon political accountability, and upon a political class which takes \nseriously its responsibility for holding ministers to account. See further Adam Tomkins, The Constitution after \nScott: Government Unwrapped (Clarendon, Oxford 1998) 266-75. \n 9 \nThis republican-inspired account has attracted considerable comment, albeit much of \nit critical.40 For our purposes, however, what is significant about Tomkins\u2019 scholarship is that \nit bespeaks a concern to move beyond Griffith\u2019s descriptivism in order to construct a \nnormatively attractive vision of a political constitution that explains how day-to-day political \nactivity, and the exercise of ministerial responsibility in particular, helps to realize the basic \nnorms of republicanism.  \n \nLike Tomkins, Richard Bellamy has drawn upon republican theory to develop an \nexplicitly normative account of the idea of a political constitution.41 Yet, unlike Tomkins, for \nwhom ministerial responsibility to Parliament is the core of a political constitution, the \nlegislature\u2019s law-making function is the thread that runs throughout Bellamy\u2019s designation of \nthe political constitution as the democratic constitution. This emphasizes not only the politics \nof prevailing constitutional arrangements\u2014the constitution as the contingent, contested result \nof reasonable disagreement operating under the circumstances of politics, where \nconstitutional change is effected for the most part through the prevailing political majority\u2014\nbut also the grounding of the constitution in the democratic. For Bellamy, \u2018the democratic \nprocess is the constitution\u2019.42 On this account, the constitution never escapes democracy, \ninsofar as it is never beyond question or amendment by the principal political institutions, \nacting through ordinary political (and, for the most part, legislative) processes. The \nconstitution is sustained (not undermined) by the day-to-day activity of democratic politics\u2014\nand, in this, is forever subject to modification and amendment through such political activity. \nThe constitution is forever within the legislature\u2019s grasp and forever subject to challenge, \nrevision, amendment and\u2014conceivably\u2014rejection.  \n \nFor Bellamy, no political matter may be decided other than by the people, lest that \nmatter (no matter how obvious or true or right) become a source of domination over the \npeople. This confronts the view of legal constitutionalists, according to which certain matters \nare not\u2014or, once positioned at the constitutional level, are no longer\u2014political. For some \nlegal constitutionalists, certain \u2018constitutionalized\u2019 matters are beyond recall or question by \npolitical institutions through the normal political processes; they exist within a non-political \nworld. But this stratagem is nothing other than politics cloaked in false neutrality, Bellamy \n                                                 \n40 For the criticism that Tomkins is selective in his use of historic materials to draw out what he takes to be the \ndistinctive republican streak in Britain, see Martin Loughlin, \u2018Towards a Republican Revival\u2019 (2006) 26 OJLS \n425-37, 430-433.

It seems that from Bellamy\u2019s standpoint, there is no non-political world, \nno matter that should be taken from the people and determined by some authority other than \ntheir own. The republican norm of non-domination requires that only the people rule \nthemselves.   \n \nLike Tomkins\u2019, Bellamy\u2019s account of a political constitution evinces the critical \nrelationship between the constitution and ordinary day-to-day politics, even if they develop \nthe political constitutionalist\u2019s claims differently. These differences are explainable, in part, \nby the \u2018purpose\u2019 of a constitution attributed by each, and the role of Parliament within it. \nTomkins talks of a constitution as being \u2018to check government\u2019.43 If this aptly captures his \nvision of a constitution, there is little surprise that he should underline the central importance \nof ministerial responsibility to Parliament and, in turn, that his concern should be with the \ninfluence of party whips and the need for more free votes in Parliament.44 Indeed, Tomkins \nhas gone further in articulating his vision of a political constitution, arguing that \u2018we should \nabandon the notion that Parliament is principally a legislator\u2019; rather, today, Parliament is first \nand foremost a \u2018scrutiner\u2019 or \u2018regulator\u2019 of government.45 Meanwhile, Bellamy\u2019s \nunderstanding of a constitution seems implicitly to emphasize not just a \u2018negative\u2019 red-light \nconstitutionalism, in which the prime concern is to check government, but also a \u2018positive\u2019 \nconstitutionalism in which political institutions and processes, and the legislative process \nmore particularly, help to realize constitutional goods, including political equality. Bellamy\u2019s \nidea of a political constitution is one which recognizes that a legislature premised upon \nmajority rule, periodic elections and party competition will \u2018institutionalize mechanisms of \npolitical balance and political accountability that provide incentives for politicians to attend to \nthe judgments and interests of those they govern\u2019.46 The thrust of Bellamy\u2019s argument is that \ncompetition between political parties \u2018reinforces [a system of political equality] by promoting \nthe responsiveness of political agents to their citizen principals\u2019.47  \n \nWhile Tomkins and Bellamy have, for the most part, carried the normative turn in \npolitical constitutionalist scholarship, a survey of this turn would be incomplete if it omitted \nreference to Martin Loughlin.48 For although Loughlin has not identified himself as a \nparticipant in the political constitutionalist debate and, indeed, has expressly disassociated \nhimself from the rubric of a political constitution,49 political constitutionalists have found \nmuch to support their thinking in Loughlin\u2019s scholarship on the relationship between public \nlaw and politics. The disagreement that animates citizens, the contestability of political \ndecisions, and the idea of law being a distinctive form of political discourse all animate \nLoughlin\u2019s scholarship as they do political constitutionalist thought. Yet, when Loughlin turns \ndirectly to the idea of a political constitution, he conceives of it as \u2018concerned with drawing a \n                                                 \n43 Tomkins (n 5) 3. \n44 Ibid 136-139.

Nevertheless, while not participating directly in the normative \nturn described in this section, Loughlin has undoubtedly shaped the normative bases upon \nwhich this turn relies.51 \n \nThe normative turn within political constitutionalist scholarship has answered the first \nof two challenges that arise as a result Griffith\u2019s downplaying of (but not denying the) \nnormative content within a political constitution. While many might take issue with the \nnormative qualities attributed to various aspects of day-to-day politics, Bellamy and Tomkins \nsucceed in rendering explicit the normativity of a political constitution. But a second, related \nchallenge remains: to account for why this normative content remained for Griffith and, we \nsuggest, remains for Tomkins and Bellamy, indistinct and ill-defined. In other words, what is \nit about a political constitution that invites, and possibly even demands, ambiguity about its \nprecise normative content? That is the task to which we now turn. \n \n4.  Prescriptive without Prescribing \n \nIn our view, both a political constitution and a legal constitution are prescriptive, but not only \ndo they make different demands of different political and judicial actors, they do so in more \nand less exacting ways. The prescriptions of a legal constitution are the more extensive and \nexacting, and thereby also the easier to detect. Typically, the idea of a legal constitution is \nassociated with a constitutional text and a set of unwritten (judicially expounded) \nconstitutional principles. The constitution is higher law, in the sense that \u2018ordinary\u2019 law \nconflicting with it is liable to be held invalid in the judicial process. What bears emphasis is \nthat a legal constitution provides detailed and strong prescriptions as to the basic character, \ncontent and workings of the constitution, including, for example, prescriptions on which \nrights to include in a written bill of rights and on which grounds to exercise judicial review. \nFormalized legal instruments, such as a written constitution and a bill of rights, occupy much \nof the terrain populated by political actors, serving to bound political activity, including by \nprescribing procedures limiting the ability of political actors to change the constitution \nthrough the regular legislative process. Transgressions of the prescriptions laid down by a \nlegal constitution are (said to be) easily identified, with judges pronouncing definitively on \nthe requirements of formalized constitutional arrangements.  \n \nIn contrast, a political constitution offers no comparable, definitive prescriptions: no \nformalized legal instruments, no immutable statement of rights or architectural arrangements, \nno procedures entrenching the constitution, and no fixed constitutional boundaries to be \npoliced. As a result, the idea of a political constitution continues to give rise to some \nambiguity as to how it can be prescriptive in the absence of similarly overt prescriptions. The \nnormative content of a political constitution is, in other words, difficult to discern. It is \nnotable that just as the normative content of a political constitution is difficult to discern, so \ntoo are the very workings of a political constitution. Indeed, it occurs to us that a contributing \nfactor to why the normativity of a political constitution remains obscured is because the \nworkings of the political constitution are themselves less visible than a legal constitution. \n                                                 \n50 Ibid \n51 For eg, Loughlin\u2019s critical review of Rawls\u2019 political liberalism will readily resonate with political \nconstitutionalists: see Martin Loughlin, \u2018Constitutional Theory: A 25th Anniversary Essay\u2019 (2005) 25 OJLS 183-\n202, 187-191. \n 12 \nBecause a political constitution \u2018lives on changing from day to day\u2019 (as Griffith noted), and \nbecause, in a very real sense, \u2018the democratic process is the constitution\u2019 (as Bellamy noted), \na political constitution is, in the final analysis, difficult to identify as a phenomenon distinct \nfrom day-to-day political activity. There is no appeal to a reified constitutional text, to a bill \nof rights or to grand judicial pronouncements. Rather, a political constitution works primarily, \nand often imperceptibly, inside Parliament and the executive and, where visible, its workings \nwill often appear less dignified and more haphazard than court proceedings, as members of \nParliament argue amongst each other, harangue the Prime Minister and then, for the most \npart, rally behind their party whips. In our view, this (in)visibility offers a partial explanation \nfor why support for the idea of a political constitution seems to be dwindling: much of the \nworkings of a political constitution are not visible, and where they are, they often take the \nform of the rough and tumble of day-to-day politics that \u2018offend most of our rational and all \nof our artistic sensibilities\u2019.52 \n \nWhile it is true that the prescriptions of a legal constitution are more extensive and \nexacting than those of a political constitution\u2014which explains, in part, why the normativity \nof a legal constitution is the easier to detect\u2014it would be wrong to conclude from this alone \nthat the normativity of a legal constitution is more compelling than that of its political \ncounterpart. In the same way that it would be wrong to evaluate the quality of reasoning \nwithin a legislative forum against the standards of reasoning within a judicial forum, so too \nwe should not expect a political constitution to exhibit the same species of normativity \ndiscernible within a legal constitution. Indeed, if we are willing to envisage the normativity of \na constitution otherwise than a legal constitutionalist would, we might come to appreciate that \nthere is something inherent in the idea of a political constitution that invites some necessary \n(and welcome) ambiguity about the extent to which a political constitution\u2014which is always \nsubject to the possibility of change through the political process\u2014is prescriptive.  \n \nThe idea of a political constitution is prescriptive, but it does not purport to prescribe \nthe nature and content of the constitution in great detail. By design, a political constitution \nleaves it to political actors, operating through the ordinary political process, to prescribe the \nnature and content of the constitution. At its simplest, it directs political actors to design an \nelectoral process based on some notion of equal votes and to ensure that the political process \nis based on some notion of holding those in power to account. In this, the idea of a political \nconstitution prescribes no more than the bare minimal conditions for political equality and \naccountability and non-domination. Beyond these broad parameters, there are \u2018no views of \ndemocratic procedures that all can agree best protect majority rule, guarantee free discussion \nor protect minorities\u2019.53 And because of this, no more prescriptions\u2014in number or detail\u2014\nshould be undertaken by anyone other than political actors. A political constitution does not \nprescribe in any great detail because one of its basic features is its constant liability to the \npossibility of change effected through the ordinary political process. It would not be coherent \nfor the idea of a political constitution to prescribe that the nature and content of the \nconstitution must always remain liable to change through the ordinary political process and \nyet also, at the same time, to prescribe that very nature and content.  \n \nThe significance of this becomes apparent if we contrast the role of political actors \nwithin the legal constitution and political constitution, respectively. The idea of a legal \n                                                 \n52 Michael Oakeshott, The Politics of Faith and the Politics of Scepticism (Yale University Press, New Haven \n1996) 19. \n53 Bellamy (n 5) 134. \n 13 \nconstitution presents the constitution as a fixed, end-point for political actors. Now, it is true \nthat a legal constitution is not necessarily fixed in the sense that it is unchanging, at least \ninsofar as it is subject to \u2018growth\u2019 under the guise of \u2018living tree\u2019 interpretation in the judicial \nforum or the evolution of \u2018unwritten principles\u2019 at common law. However, a legal constitution \nis, in effect, a fixed, end-point for political actors insofar as constraints are imposed upon \n(and, for the most part, are not amendable by) those actors. In contrast, the idea of a political \nconstitution conceives of a constitution as more contingent, dynamic and political activity. It \nis appropriate to recall Griffith\u2019s characterization of a political constitution as one in which \n\u2018[e]verything that happens is constitutional\u2019, and where \u2018if nothing happened that would be \nconstitutional also\u2019. As we read this famous passage, Griffith\u2019s implication is that a political \nconstitution is a direct expression of day-to-day political activity. Absent a set of fundamental \nlaws, justiciable and enforceable in the courts, that impose restraints on political institutions \nand the political process more generally, a political constitution is conceived as a direct \nexpression of ordinary political activity operating within and across political institutions. \nCritically, a political constitution is conceived in a way that makes explicit the possibility of \nadaptation, and even radical adaptation, through such ordinary, day-to-day political activity.  \n \nIn a sentence that aptly captures this less exacting, but nonetheless normative \norientation, Bellamy writes that the constitution \u2018must be left open so we may rebuild the ship \nat sea\u2014employing, as we must, the prevailing procedures to renew and reform those self-\nsame procedures\u2019.54 For Bellamy, and for political constitutionalists more generally, the ship \nof state is rebuilt according to the ordinary political process that is\u2013\u2013so to speak\u2013\u2013already at \nsea. In other words, the constitution and the political process which gives it shape are both \nalready constituted. We, political actors and citizens, are not in the scholar\u2019s \u2018original \nposition\u2019 charged with designing a first constitution from naught. Rather, we are already at \nsea; a constitution is already before us, the political process already in use, and the process of \nrebuilding is, simply put, continual. For a political constitution, there is thus no single, \nidentifiable moment of constitution-making and, for the political constitutionalist, it is right \nthat this should be so. Because disagreement will never cease and because changing \ncircumstances will likely affect people\u2019s reasoned opinions, constitution-making should be \nseen as \u2018an ongoing political process\u2019 in the circumstances of politics.55 In this way, the idea \nof a political constitution encourages us to see (and to design) a constitution as created, \nsustained and amended through the ordinary political process that is the focus of day-to-day \npolitics. It is thus that we might say that the idea of a political constitution is one that is \nprescriptive without really prescribing. Or rather: the idea of a political constitution prescribes \nthat is for us all, for the most part acting through representatives in political institutions, to do \nthe prescribing. \n \nKeeping all this in mind, we can see that the ambiguity that has so troubled \ninterpretations of Griffith\u2019s political constitution as normatively empty may be the inevitable \nambiguity of any account of a constitution which purports to be prescriptive without \nprescribing much. The normativity of a political constitution is necessarily ambiguous \nbecause its ought-propositions are minimal; it directs, in effect, little more than that it is for all \nof us, acting principally through our elected representatives in Parliament, to do the \nprescribing. Of course, there is a deeper concern here, for some at least. Some will worry that \na constitution that prescribes so little allows political actors too much latitude; too much room \nto ride roughshod over the rights of minorities or to disregard important boundaries of \n                                                 \n54 Ibid 174 (emphasis added). \n55 Ibid 106. \n 14 \nconstitutional government. There is, in other words, a real concern that a constitution should \nnot be one where everything that happens, no matter the nature or content, is constitutional.  \n \nTo this political constitutionalists might respond: \u2018whilst everything that happens is \nconstitutional, not just anything can happen\u2019.56 There are two claims wrapped within this \nresponse: empirical and normative. By laying stress on \u2018real democracy\u2019, \u2018real politics\u2019 and \n\u2018actually existing political practices\u2019, political constitutionalists have rightly insisted on the \nempirical claim that a political institution that can do anything, in the sense of there being no \nlegal limits on its powers, seldom actually does everything within its grasp. Rather, as \npolitical constitutionalists are keen to demonstrate, politics, unconstrained by judicially \nenforceable legal limits, can be used as the means to realize good ends. As we saw in the \nprevious section, for Tomkins, this involves placing stress on the exercise of ministerial \nresponsibility to Parliament as a way of checking the power of government; for Bellamy, this \ninvolves placing stress on how, far from endangering the rule of law and individual rights, \nParliament\u2019s law-making function supplies much of their rationale and best defence.  \n \nBuilding on this empirical claim, political constitutionalists also make a normative \nclaim. By specifying that not just anything can happen, political constitutionalists can be \ntaken to claim that not just anything should happen. Or, more strongly put: certain things, \nalbeit minimal, should happen. As just reviewed, the idea of a political constitution provides \npolitical actors with the directive: design a constitution that provides for the equal \nparticipation of all citizens, but, at the same time, ensure that this design is itself subject to the \npossibility of re-design. Fail in this task and the result will be a distancing from the republican \nideal and a concomitant source of domination and political inequality. The result will not, \nhowever, be \u2018invalid\u2019 or contrary to fundamental law, as legal constitutionalists would \nmaintain in relation to their more exacting prescriptions. The political constitution\u2019s directive \nis prescriptive but not binding in the way of a legal constitution. \n \nOur claim, then, is that both a political constitution and a legal constitution share the \nnormativity of an account that makes claims of political and judicial actors, even if they make \ndifferent claims of each. However, where the species of normativity diverge is in the degree to \nwhich they prescribe. Legal constitutionalists prefer to set the stage before the actors step in \nand to determine their script to the greatest detail. In contrast, by self-consciously directing \npolitical actors to conceive of themselves as engaging in constitutional activity at the same \ntime as they are engaged in ordinary, day-to-day political activity, political constitutionalists \nprescribe very little beyond the basic command to leave to political actors the responsibility to \nprescribe (and re-prescribe) the content and character of their constitution. The species of \nnormativity inhabiting a political constitution thus escapes reification but, at times, also \nescapes obvious identification and classification. Yet, despite the relative indistinctness and \nill-definition of its prescriptions, whenever one talks in terms of a political constitution, one \nmust not lose sight of the fact that one appeals to a normative model of the constitution. Now, \nit is of course true that this model envisages a constitution that is contingent, contested, and \neven often times messy\u2014but what recognizing a political constitution as a normative model \nhelps us to grasp is that a political constitution is none the worse for it. For, at its best, a \npolitical constitution reflects the maturity, seriousness and responsibility of our political \nactors. And even at their worst, which is to say, for some political actors at least, much of the \ntime, a political constitution still supplies a normatively attractive account of how we ought to \ngovern ourselves. \n                                                 \n56 Gee (n 8) 42 (emphasis in original). \n 15 \n \n5.  The Model of a Political Constitution \n \nWe are now in a position to venture an answer to the question posed\u2014what is a political \nconstitution? In our view, a political constitution, conceived in reflective terms, is a normative \nmodel. We have, thus far, concentrated on making sense of the normativity of this model; that \nis to say, we have sought to show that what is distinctive about the normativity of a political \nconstitution is that it is prescriptive without prescribing much. In this section, our attention \nshifts to what it means to talk of a political constitution as a model. While some political \nconstitutionalists talk in terms of models,57 none has sought to explain the significance of this \ndesignation. This is unfortunate. To answer the question\u2014what is a political constitution?\u2014\nwe seek not only to offer an account of the normativity of a political constitution, but also to \nexplain what it means to talk in terms of constitutional models. \n \nA model supplies an explanatory framework within which to make sense of a real \nworld constitution. Because real world constitutions tend to be complex and contingent, and \nbecause our grasp of their intricacies is so fragile, we employ models, more or less explicitly, \nto help us \u2018describe events, ascribe causality between events, impute motive or intention, \ndiscern meaning, and apply norms as standards of evaluation\u2019.58 That is to say, we employ \nmodels to help make sense of real world constitutions. The explanatory framework supplied \nby a constitutional model involves an appeal to some idea or group of ideas; in the case of the \nmodel of a political constitution, as conceived by Tomkins and Bellamy, this appeal is largely \nto a republican ideal. The significance of such an appeal, whether to a republican or some \nother ideal, is that it enables us to adopt a critical stance with respect to the subject matter of \nanalysis\u2013\u2013here, the practices and institutions of a real world constitution. We are then \nequipped to understand and evaluate this subject matter from the perspective supplied by the \nmodel. But note that a constitutional model should never be wholly abstracted from that \nwhich it seeks to explain. After all, constitutional theory, properly conceived, \u2018does not \ninvolve an inquiry into ideal forms\u2019 but rather \u2018must aim to identify the character of actually \nexisting constitutional arrangements\u2019.59 This ambition ought to resonate especially with those, \nlike Griffith, who have sought to explicate existing constitutional practices. But of course, it is \nthis very concern to ground the idea of a political constitution in \u2018actually existing \nconstitutional arrangements\u2019 that has lead others to deride these same scholars as offering no \nmore than an account of what happens. \n \nDoubtless, the explanatory framework supplied by a model will be idealized and \nstylized, but the discipline of thinking and talking in terms of a model is key because it opens \nup a critical space wherein there need not be some stark, all-encompassing choice in any \ngiven real world constitution between two (or more) models. For if we keep in mind that a \nmodel necessarily assumes some distance between the instance and the ideal, we are better \nplaced to appreciate that any given example (a real world constitution) will not resonate in all \nrespects with a given exemplar (a political or legal or some other model). In turn, this allows \nus to grasp the possibility that there might be more than one model informing a given real \nworld constitution. Indeed, this is the key insight to result from talking and thinking in terms \nof constitutional models. For this insight can help us to appreciate that Britain\u2019s constitution is \n                                                 \n57 While the rubric of \u2018models\u2019 does not feature in Bellamy\u2019s Political Constitutionalism, it is prominent in \nTomkins\u2019 Our Republican Constitution.  \n58 Loughlin (n 3) 52. Loughlin does not talk in terms of constitutional models; that said, similar concerns \nunderlie his interpretive approach and our account of the model of a political constitution.  \n59 Ibid 186. \n 16 \nno longer\u2014and likely never was\u2014premised on any one constitutional model, whether this be \na political or a legal or some other model. Rather, we are now better placed to recognize that \nBritain\u2019s constitution today embraces, perhaps in uncertain ways and to an uncertain extent, \nboth a political model and a legal model. \n \nPerhaps because neither a political constitution nor a legal constitution have been \nexamined explicitly as constitutional models, what is often absent from most accounts of a \nreal world constitution given by legal and political constitutionalists alike is an exploration \n(or, for that matter, even an acknowledgment) of how it can be true both that a real world \nconstitution will embrace both models and that a political model and a legal model are, at \nleast in some significant respects, at odds. Because political constitutionalists have, for the \nmost part, proceeded to defend the model of a political constitution by way of a \u2018challenge\u2019 to \nthe \u2018common view\u2019 of a legal constitution and the \u2018unexamined and erroneous assumptions \nabout the workings of democracy on which its rests\u2019,60 they have tended to focus on the \nopposition between the two models, rather than on how they can both be incompletely \nrealized within a real world constitution. For example, while Bellamy acknowledges that \n\u2018there are elements of both legal and political constitutionalism in most constitutions\u2019,61 he \noffers an account which makes\u2014or at least seems to make\u2014an all-encompassing claim about \nthe choice facing real world constitutions. For, on our reading, Bellamy does not regard it as \nnormatively desirable that elements drawn from a legal model may in fact subsist within a \nreal world constitution alongside elements drawn from a political model. Indeed, insofar as \nBellamy presents his model of a political constitution as the original and true source of the \nrepublican norms of non-domination and political equality, it would appear that a constitution \nought to remain unburdened by elements drawn from a legal model. In this, his treatment of \nthe model of a political constitution makes it difficult to conceive of how it could subsist \nalongside the model of a legal constitution within a given real world constitution. It would \nseem, then, that on this reading of Bellamy, no real world constitution can embrace elements \nof both a political and a legal constitution, for what the one seeks to promote, the other \ndistorts; what the one protects, the other undermines. In other words, it would seem that for \nBellamy at least, there is a stark choice between either a legal constitution or a political \nconstitution\u2013\u2013but not both. \n \nSomething similar might be said of Tomkins. Although he acknowledges that Britain\u2019s \nconstitution can be said to be \u2018primarily\u2019 (and by implication not exclusively) political rather \nthan legal in character, and although alive to the dangers involved in any shift away from a \npolitical towards a legal model, Tomkins does not explain what it means to suggest that \nBritain\u2019s constitution today embraces elements drawn from each model.62 This should not be \ntaken to suggest that the presentation of stark alternatives is only active within political \nconstitutionalist scholarship; legal constitutionalists appear as guilty of this indictment as their \n\u2018antagonists\u2019. Irrespective of where the fault lies, it is by rejecting the view that the stark \nalternatives painted by certain political and legal constitutionalists must also play out in a real \nworld constitution that one can, in turn, see how it can be true both that a political model and \n                                                 \n60 Bellamy (n 5) 5. \n61 Ibid \n62 Tomkins (n 5) vii; Adam Tomkins, \u2018Constitutionalism\u2019 in Mathew Flinders et al (eds), The Oxford Handbook \nof British Politics (OUP, Oxford 2009) 242. In his most recent work, Tomkins has sought to sketch the role of \nand limits on judicial review in a political constitution: Adam Tomkins, \u2018The Role of Courts in the Political \nConstitution\u2019 (2010) 60 UTLJ 1-22. For a critique of Tomkins\u2019 thinking on judicial review, see Paul P Craig, \n\u2018Political Constitutionalism and Judicial Review\u2019 in Christopher Forsyth et al (eds), Effective Judicial Review: A \nCornerstone of Good Governance (OUP, Oxford forthcoming). \n 17 \na legal model are, at least in some significant respects, at odds and yet can be embraced by a \nreal world constitution.  \n \nThe seeming contradiction between these two truths can be answered by recognizing the \ndifference between the ideal and the instance that underpins and informs the notion of a \nconstitutional model. To develop a more rounded sense of any real world constitution (such as \nBritain\u2019s) almost inevitably involves an appeal to, amongst other things, both a political \nmodel and a legal model. With this in mind, it will come as little surprise to learn that a \nsubsisting real world constitution, whether in Britain or elsewhere, will tend to embrace a \npolitical or legal or any model for that matter, in some, perhaps many, but likely never all \nrespects. An all-encompassing claim that a real world constitution is \u2018legal\u2019 or \u2018political\u2019 can, \non this view, be read as an exaggerated claim which agitates for the evolution of a real world \nconstitution in one direction, rather than another. In most cases, and most obviously at a time \nof seemingly rapid constitutional change in Britain, these exaggerated, all-encompassing \nclaims will not be accurate evaluations of a given real world constitution. This is not to say \nthat it is never appropriate to employ an all-encompassing claim. Inasmuch as articulating \nunfashionable claims in encompassing terms can be an effective way of illuminating the \nshortcomings of conventional thought, there will likely always be some place for such claims. \nYet, as Loughlin notes, where, as today, there is \u2018renewed interest in investigating \nconstitutional fundamentals, constitutional scholarship should not be converted into some \nadversarial contest\u2019.63 In this light, it is perhaps truer to maintain that a real world constitution \ntends\u2014albeit in different, challenging and at times contradictory ways\u2014to embrace both of \nthe models of a political and a legal constitution and that each model seeks to render explicit \ndifferent facets of our constitutional self-understandings.  \n \n6. Embracing the Political and the Legal \n \nWhile there is a noticeable tendency for political and legal constitutionalists to engage in all-\nencompassing claims about the nature and content of Britain\u2019s constitution, there are also, it \nmust be said, a number of writers who acknowledge the constitution\u2019s dual embrace of \nelements drawn from the model of a political constitution and its legal counterpart. Recently, \nsome have begun to offer accounts of this dual embrace which seek to chart the ways in and \ndegree to which the constitution draws on each of the two models. This is welcome. But \nwhenever such an account is given, three propositions should be kept in mind. First, people \nwill offer different understandings of what it means to talk of a specific real world \nconstitution\u2019s dual embrace of the legal and political models, with at least some of the \ndifferences between these understandings explicable by whether one is more inclined towards \na political or legal (or some other) model in the first place. Proponents of a political model\u2014\nsuch as Bellamy and Tomkins\u2014will likely offer understandings which differ in important \nrespects from those favoured by proponents of a legal model\u2014for example, Allan, Laws or \nTom Hickman. For that matter, proponents of the different models will even differently \nenvisage what is involved in offering an account of Britain\u2019s dual embrace of the political and \nlegal. Legal constitutionalists may envisage accounts of \u2018politics under the constraints of legal \norder\u2019.64 In turn, political constitutionalists may envisage law as politics by some other \nmeans. That differences may exist between how political and legal constitutionalists make \nsense of a real world constitution\u2019s dual embrace of the political and the legal, and that one of \nthese two models will tend to supply a dominant frame within which to accommodate \n                                                 \n63 Loughlin (n 40) 435. \n64 David Dyzenhaus, \u2018The Difference that Law Makes\u2019 (1997) 60 MLR 866-73, 870. \n 18 \nelements drawn from the other, is scarcely surprising. For when trying to make sense of a real \nworld constitution\u2019s dual embrace of both the political and the legal models, political and \nlegal constitutionalists alike will tend to supply an account of the constitution that is itself \nshaped, more or less explicitly, in the image of their favoured model. \n \nSecond, because people tend to perceive a real world constitution\u2019s dual embrace of \nthe political and the legal in ways shaped by their commitment to some model of the \nconstitution, it will often prove difficult to offer an account which is thoroughly faithful to the \nbasic claims of\u2014or possibly even the animating spirit of\u2014both constitutional models. Take \nHickman\u2019s essay in which he purports to offer an account of \u2018the legal constitution plus \npolitical constitution, rather than the legal constitution versus political constitution\u2019.65 \nHickman\u2019s objective, as disclosed by the title of his article, \u2018In Defence of the Legal \nConstitution\u2019, is to defend the model of a legal constitution. Ultimately, for Hickman, the \nBritish constitution ought to be \u2018understood as founded upon law that is enforceable in the \ncourts\u2019,66 and is thus essentially, or predominantly at least, understood by reference to the \nmodel of a legal constitution. He seeks, however, to mount a defence of (what he takes to be) \nBritain\u2019s predominantly legal constitution that is sensitive to the fact that law \u2018cannot provide \nanswers to every question\u2019, and that acknowledges that the courts \u2018must always show due \ndeference to the decisions and activities of the political institutions\u2019.67 He is concerned, in \nparticular, to demonstrate that Britain\u2019s predominantly legal constitution encompasses the \nmechanisms of political accountability closely associated with the model of a political \nconstitution. It is thus that Hickman points to a set of cases that, in his opinion, reveal the \ntendency of Britain\u2019s legal constitution \u2018to reinforce political methods of accountability\u2019.68 By \nconceiving of the constitution \u2018in terms of a harmonious and mutually reinforcing matrix of \ninteracting, and frequently overlapping, remedial channels that together facilitate and control \ngovernance of the state\u2019,69 Hickman offers a predominantly legal account of the British \nconstitution which at the same time purports to take the model of a political constitution \nseriously. In this, Hickman attempts to plot a path between those legal constitutionalists who \nwould suggest that \u2018law should be always pushed forward, ever more intrusively into the fiery \nfields of party politics and popular morality as it goes\u2019,70 as well as those political \nconstitutionalists who would \u2018insist on attacking the idea of the [legal] constitution itself\u2019.71  \n \nWhile we welcome Hickman\u2019s recognition of the need to explore \u2018the interface \nbetween the modern political and legal constitutions\u2019,72 and while we find his suggestion that \n\u2018the legal and political constitutions [should be conceived] not as competitors, but as \npartners\u201973 an intriguing one, it is not clear to us that he succeeds in depicting Britain\u2019s \n                                                 \n65 Tom R Hickman, \u2018In Defence of the Legal Constitution\u2019 (2005) 55 UTLJ 981-1025, 1016.  \n66 Ibid 987. \n67 Ibid 1016-1017. \n68 Ibid 1018. Hickman\u2019s account appeals to the \u2018conversational nature of constitutional arrangements\u2019 promoted \nby a dialogue between court and legislature that purports to be informed by both the legal and the political \nmodels of the constitution (at 1020). For Hickman\u2019s assessment of the dialogue metaphor, see generally Tom R \nHickman, \u2018Constitutional Dialogue: Constitutional Theories and the Human Rights Act 1998\u2019 [2005] PL 306-35. \nFor a further, critical exploration of the metaphor, see Gr\u00e9goire C N Webber, \u2018The Unfulfilled Potential of the \nCourt and Legislature Dialogue\u2019 (2009) 42 Can J Pol Sc 443. \n69 Hickman (n 65) 1016. \n70 Ibid 1018. \n71 Ibid 1016. \n72 Ibid 990. \n73 Ibid 1016. \n 19 \nconstitution as an essentially legal constitution which, at the same time, takes the model of a \npolitical constitution seriously. For a start, Hickman\u2019s account is premised on a narrow \nunderstanding of the model of a political constitution as one that helps to make sense of \u2018a \ncomplex and vitally important set of structures of political accountability (such as the various \nombudsmen, inspectorates, complaints procedures, auditors, and channels of ministerial \nresponsibility, as well as many more)\u2019.74 In this, he explicitly rejects the possibility that the \nmodel of a political constitution might serve as an important explanatory model in clarifying \neither the theoretical foundations of Britain\u2019s constitution or the character of its prevailing \ninstitutions\u2014and, in this, Hickman\u2019s account comes close to making the sort of all-\nencompassing claims that he purports to eschew. Indeed, given his narrow conception of a \npolitical constitution, it is unsurprising that at the same time as Hickman acknowledges that \n\u2018in terms of the day-to-day operation and regulation of government\u2019, the model of a political \nconstitution \u2018is more important than its legal kin, and it should undoubtedly be at the forefront \nof constitutional scholarship\u2019,75 he also suggests that, \u2018more often than might be expected\u2019, it \nis the legal model, rather than its political counterpart, \u2018that hold[s] the solutions to matters of \ncontemporary dispute\u2019.76 \n \nMore importantly, perhaps, Hickman does not always seem to engage with the full \nforce of the basic claims that underpin a political constitution. For example, he purports to \naddress \u2018the provisional nature of constitutional arrangements\u2019, suggesting that \u2018this feature of \nthe constitution is perfectly consistent with liberal legalism, insofar as a liberal and legal \nconstitution allows for the evolving nature of moral values and insists that legal norms are \nsufficiently open to accommodate and, indeed, inculcate shifts in moral consensus\u2019.77 \nHowever, for a political constitutionalist, the claim is not merely that the constitution should \nbe viewed as provisional, in the sense of being subject to the possibility of change. There is a \nsecond, critical aspect to this claim: such constitutional change should occur through the \nordinary political process that can best realize the republican norms of non-domination and \npolitical equality. It is not clear that Hickman\u2019s \u2018legal constitution plus political constitution\u2019 \nattaches sufficient weight (or provides an adequate response) to this half of the political \nconstitutionalist\u2019s claim. Consequently, it seems that, at most, Hickman\u2019s constitution is a \nlegal constitution plus a pale imitation of a political constitution.  \n \nThe second proposition relevant to how a real world constitution embraces both the \npolitical and the legal thus suggests that it will often prove difficult to develop an account of a \nreal world constitution\u2019s dual embrace of the political and legal models that remains faithful \nto the basic claims and animating spirit of a political constitution and a legal constitution. \nNow, this difficulty doubtless draws on the reality that, even while there might be elements of \neach model within a real world constitution and even while many of those elements may be \nmore or less compatible with each other, a political constitution and a legal constitution are \nincompatible\u2014qua models\u2014in important respects. For each model makes claims about the \nnature, content and workings of the constitution which cannot be fully reconciled with each \nother. It seems inevitable that whenever attempt is made to explain the dual embrace of the \npolitical and the legal models within a real world constitution, the resulting account will be \none that does not, and in all likelihood never could, internalize the full extent of the conflict \nbetween the two models. To take a crude example, if a legal constitutionalist sought to temper \n                                                 \n74 Ibid 987.  \n75 Ibid 987. \n76 Ibid 990. \n77 Ibid 998. \n 20 \njudicial review of legislation with an account of deference to Parliament, proponents of a \npolitical model might still have concerns that decisions taken by elected politicians were \nliable to being overturned by unelected judges. \n \nThe third proposition relevant to the ways in which a real world constitution embraces \nboth a legal model and a political model draws on the contingency of this dual embrace. \nBecause both a legal and a political constitution can each be imagined in different ways, and \nbecause at times they prescribe conflicting arrangements even if they can be compatible in \nmany other respects, their relationship within a real world constitution will itself always be \ncontingent. This can be taken to be one (but not the only) reason why any assessment of the \nrelationship between the model of a political constitution and the model of a legal constitution \nought not to be starkly presented as either in tension or in harmony. It seems an over-\nsimplification to suggest, as Hickman does, that \u2018[w]hat we require if we are to move forward \nis an account that presents the legal and political constitutions not as competitors but as \npartners\u2019.78 Rather, it may be that the interface of a legal constitution and a political \nconstitution is in fact messy, uncertain and contested\u2014and perhaps for the same or similar \nreasons that animate a political constitution itself, this may be a good thing. For in \ncontingency lies the potential to imagine things otherwise. Even though each of us will view a \nreal world constitution in ways shaped by our favoured model, and even though it may prove \ndifficult to offer an account faithful to the basic claims of other models, this ought not to stop \nus from offering accounts which identify new and interesting ways in which our favoured \nmodel makes sense of existing constitutional practices. Or differently put: the mere fact that \nwe recognize that a real world constitution will embrace any one model of the constitution in \nsome, but not all respects ought not to preclude us from searching out previously overlooked \nways in which our favoured model casts light on the nature and content of some facet of that \nreal world constitution.79 \n \nThis third proposition thus suggests, perhaps paradoxically, that recognizing that there is \nan \u2018unreality\u201980 in categorizing a real world constitution as either entirely political or entirely \nlegal ought to breathe new life into the political and legal models by encouraging the \nproponents of each to venture into unfamiliar territory and to uncover the relevance of their \nfavoured model in elucidating some facet of constitutional arrangements and practice. This is \nsignificant. For there is, we suspect, scepticism amongst some of those who are aligned to \nneither the legal nor political models about whether either model can add much to our \nunderstanding of the modern British constitution. Tired of the seemingly stark choice between \neither a political constitution or a legal constitution, and weary of the all-encompassing claims \nwhich too often seem to underlie such a choice, some may quite reasonably question whether \neither model adds much to our understanding of a constitution which, today, seems to be \nneither distinctively legal nor distinctively political. However, it seems to us that both models \nare, in some respects, more critical than ever to making sense of the British constitution. By \ndrawing both on the model of a political constitution and on that of a legal constitution, while \nof course recognizing that each is ultimately a highly stylized reading of the constitution \n                                                 \n78 Ibid 1016.  \n79 For an attempt to explain why the model of a political constitution is relevant to explaining how judicial \nindependence obtains in Britain, as well as to draw out its relevance for those keen to make sense of the reforms \ninstituted by the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, reforms which tend to be taken as evidence of Britain\u2019s further \nshift away from a political constitution towards a legal constitution, see Graham Gee, \u2018Defending Judicial \nIndependence in the British Constitution\u2019 in Adam Dodek and Lorne Sossin (eds), The Future of Judicial \nIndependence (Irwin Law, Toronto forthcoming).  \n80 Ian Leigh, \u2018Secrets of the Political Constitution\u2019 (1999) 62 MLR 298-309, 309. \n 21 \nwhich will only be embraced in some but not all respects, it ought to be possible to uncover \nnew and more interesting ways of speaking about Britain\u2019s constitution today. There is, after \nall, a real sense in which some of the more pressing questions about the nature and content of \nthe constitution are laid bare by the tensions that seem to exist between the two models. To be \neffective tools for understanding a constitution, however, the models and the contingent \nrelationship between them must remain subject to constant re-imagining. \n \n7.    Conclusion \n \nWe return to the question with which we began: what is a political constitution? In \narticulating our answer \u2018a political constitution is . . .\u2019, we have sought to reflect on what a \npolitical constitution purports to be. By moving beyond the descriptivism associated with \nGriffith\u2019s political reading of Britain\u2019s constitution, and by tracing the contours of a decisive \nnormative turn evident in the scholarship of Tomkins and Bellamy, we have sought to present \na political constitution as a normative constitutional model, even if its normativity is in \nimportant and inescapable ways indistinct and ill-defined. It is by conceiving of a political \nconstitution in these terms that we come to appreciate the renewed relevance of the \ncontingent, contested, and often times messy model of a political constitution even as \nBritain\u2019s constitution is said to be slowly evolving away from a political model towards \nsomething more akin to a legal model of the constitution. \n \nThe renewed relevance of the political constitution is grounded in the understanding \nthat, qua model, it continues to speak to some, even if not all, aspects of the constitution. \nMuch constitutional scholarship in Britain is focused on trying to cast light on the nature of \nconstitutional arrangements. Yet, clearly, there is (and perhaps has long been) disagreement \nabout how best to capture these arrangements. By thinking and speaking in terms of \nnormative constitutional models, a political constitution and its legal counterpart present \nthemselves as essential facets of our constitutional self-understandings, even as it becomes \nmore difficult to claim that either model alone accounts for all aspects of Britain\u2019s \nconstitution. Indeed, it is precisely because there is such widespread and whole-hearted \ndisagreement about the nature, content and workings of the constitution as a whole, and \nprecisely because that disagreement runs so deep, that these two models\u2014the legal and the \npolitical\u2014can serve as such effective expressions of our constitutional self-understandings. \nThe key is to remember that they remain models and that they can to do no more than render \nexplicit self-understandings that are, in an important and perhaps inevitable sense, incomplete.  \n \nWhile we have focused on the political constitution in this essay, we recognize that \nboth the legal and the political models are at their most effective in rendering explicit our self-\nunderstandings when taken alongside one another. For when our attention is so focused, we \nare called on to defend existing commitments or articulate the merits of proposed reforms as \nwe seek, at the same time, to grapple with the presence of the other model within existing \nconstitutional arrangements. By understanding the promise of thinking and talking about both \nmodels together, our answer to the question\u2014what is a political constitution?\u2014can be taken \nto sketch an answer to another question not explicitly posed in this essay, but nevertheless \npresent throughout: \u2018what is a legal constitution?\u2019 \n"}
