First, maps of relative annual rainfall levels are presented for each of the twelve single-year and five protracted ENSO episodes during the period, in order to identify the associated inter-annual rainfall variations.

This is despite the long-term fluctuations in precipitation and temperature which are known to have occurred over this period. Droughts are identified following at least thirteen of the seventeen single-year and protracted ENSO episodes.
