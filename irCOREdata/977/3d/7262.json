Few would not subscribe to this aim, but proclaiming it without a full\nawareness of the problems it entails is of the same order as proclaiming one's commitment to\nPeace without further comment. Except for the absolute pacifist, being against war does not\nmean being against it at any price, but rather being committed to ensuring circumstances in\nwhich war will not occur. So it is with good practice in educational technology, which can be\nachieved only if circumstances are propitious. Such circumstances include sufficient funds,\nand a willingness in both teacher and learner to accept in whole or in part a technological\nroute \u2014 good practice is unlikely to be achieved if technology has been incorporated into the\ncurriculum merely in order to ensure that funds already spent do not appear to have been\nwasted. Above all, in my view, good practice assumes that users of learning technology are\nable to concentrate on learning without (necessarily) thinking about the technology, since if\nthe technology cannot be made to work transparently, actual practice will at best lag behind\nideal practice, and at worst be abandoned altogether. Impatience is a barrier to learning, and\nparticularly if it is the result of struggling with the learning tools themselves. If the teacher or\nlearner is constantly having to tweak the technology, or ending up with a half-baked\nimplementation because the setting-up process has proven too difficult, the learning tool may\nwell be left to gather dust.\nFax has rapidly become almost the staff of life in both commercial and educational\ninstitutions because it is on the whole reliable, and conforms to a single standard. Generally\nspeaking, however, leading-edge technology is unreliable and unfriendly. When television sets\nwere first seen in homes, they required constant adjustment and professional attention, and the\ntelevision repair business boomed. Today, repairing television sets is a cottage industry, and\nnot only because replacement may be less expensive than repair, but also because modern sets\nare technologically robust. What is more, in good measure television is now universally\npopular because the viewer knows that once a set has been bought, he or she merely has to\nplug in an aerial, tune in the stations, and all will work as expected. Television sets would be\nless numerous than they are if at each replacement the viewer had to go through a complex\nroutine to make the aerial 'handshake' with the new set, only to find that five times out of ten\nthis task could not be accomplished without expert assistance, and that three times out of the\nremaining five it could not be accomplished at all.\nThis is, unfortunately, much the case with interactive-multimedia technology. While\nword-processing is now at a stage where the user can be confident that the software and\n%ardware will work well together, interactive applications involving images and sound appear\nto-be recipes for frustration. The de facto standard in sound cards for IBM-compatibles, for\nexample, is Westpoint Creative's SoundBlaster, which forms part of that de jure standard\nknown as MPC (Multimedia PC). An MPC system, according to those who defined the\nstandard, is an IBM or IBM-compatible PC with a specified minimum central processor and\ngraphics card, specified minimum amounts of internal memory and physical storage space, a\nCD-ROM drive and a SoundBlaster or SoundBlaster-compatible sound card. Given this agreed\nspecification, a user might imagine that an application involving sound, developed for the\nMPC standard, would run perfectly on any MPC system. Matters are not that simple.\n2\nALT-J VOLUME 1 NUMBER I\nTake a PC which conforms to the MPC standard, though not actually marked MPC (there are\nmany such systems in use, while 'genuine' MPCs are rare). Contact the producer or\ndistributor of a commercial product intended for use on an MPC system and, before paying\nfor it, ask for a copper-bottomed guarantee that it will work as it should, first time and\nwithout professional help with the installation. If the producer is honest, you are likely to be\ntold that no such guarantees can be given, that it may well come down to some trial and error,\nand that when all the dust has cleared there is still a significant chance that the product may\nnot work at all. Such was the recent experience of a colleague of mine who was told by the\ndistributors of a well-known American interactive-learning product that they could not\nguarantee first-time success, in particular with the audio element of the product, because their\nown technical staff had themselves spent several frustrating hours installing it on a genuinely\nmarked MPC. First, they had had to change the sound card since it had turned out to be faulty\nonly when this particular software product had been tried with it. Then time had been spent\nsetting the system parameters so that the PC's internal memory was being handled properly,\nand discovering the right interrupts. How could they be sure, they argued with commendable\nfrankness, that the product would run properly on a PC system which had been built up over a\nperiod of time, whatever standard such a system now supposedly conformed to? Indeed, when\nmy colleague went ahead and bought the product on a sale-or-return basis, it would not run.\nAnd, not surprisingly, the installation manual was peppered with pass-the-buck advice such\nas: 'If you encounter problems, consult your sound card manual' - enough to make a beginner\ngive up before beginning. It took many telephone calls and two visits from the suppliers to\nadjust everything so that the controller software could be loaded and run. The product was\nthen tested on some students. It crashed after less than 15 minutes, displaying that Windows\nmessage which offers as little hope as Dante's gates of hell: the one that informs you of an\nunrecoverable error and impending termination of the application (once you have clicked on\nOK - Microsoft at least has a sense of irony). My colleague's final comment on the episode\nwas that she would wait until the technology had matured.\nThe world of the Apple Macintosh suffers less from problems of standards than that of the\nPC, which is no doubt partly why some educational institutions have opted for it. But there is\nlittle chance that the Macintosh or any other non-IBM system will oust the PC from its firm\nfoothold in the majority of higher-educational establishments. Many interactive-multimedia\nlearning tools will thus have to struggle for a while to establish themselves on a platform\nwhich was not originally designed to handle them, and which has spawned innumerable\ndeviations from its so-called standard - in the area of graphics alone, there are more than 30\ndifferent PC image formats.\nYet despite all this - indeed, because of it - those of us who believe in the future of\ncomputer-based learning technology (and not merely because pressure of student numbers\nmight make it inevitable) need not simply wait for a real standard to emerge out of commerce\nor entertainment in the way such standards have emerged in the past. On the contrary,\nacademics can be a major force in determining an accepted standard if they are willing to\nkeep an open mind (in other words, to eschew the Not-Invented-Here and the even more\nchildish My-System-Is-Better-Than-Yours syndromes), to co-operate in forming an upgradable\nstandard which everyone can and will accept, and then to promote it by showing what it can\nachieve. That will be a good start for the good practice we in ALT wish to foster.\nGabriel Jacobs\n3\n"}
