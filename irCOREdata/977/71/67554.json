Introduction\n[2] Ionospheric modification experiments leading to the\nproduction of radio-induced optical emissions (RIOEs) are\nnow in their fourth decade. The pioneering observational\nefforts by Sipler and Biondi [1972], Haslett and Megill\n[1974], and Gordon and Carlson [1974] at low and mid-\nlatitudes and Bra\u00a8ndstro\u00a8m et al. [1999], Kosch et al. [2000],\nPedersen and Carlson [2001], and others at high latitudes\nare now well augmented by theory and modeling [e.g.,\nBernhardt et al., 1989; Istomin and Leyser, 1995; Mishin et\nal., 2004; Gustavsson et al., 2005]. It is generally accepted\nthat wave-particle interactions accelerate electrons which\nexcite neutral (or ionized) constituents of the E and F region\nionosphere, leading to the production of RIOEs.\n[3] Until recently, observations of RIOEs were almost\nexclusively limited to the \u2018\u2018forbidden\u2019\u2019 O(1D) 630.0 nm and\nO(1S) 557.7 nm transitions of atomic oxygen. The O(1D),\nwith a relatively low excitation energy of 1.96 eV, is not\nstrongly quenched in the F region and is the most com-\nmonly observed emission. Similarly, the O(1S) 557.7 nm\nemission, with an excitation energy of 4.2 eV, is also readily\nobserved in most experiments. However, collisional\nquenching of accelerated electrons by N2 in the F region\nraises the effective excitation thresholds of the O(1D) and\nO(1S) states to \u00013.1 and \u00015.4 eV, respectively [Bernhardt\net al., 1989].\n[4] Kosch et al. [2000] first noted that, even for vertical\nheating, the optical emitting region was displaced toward\nthe magnetic zenith. Later work by, for example, Pedersen\net al. [2003], determined that the brightest emission inten-\nsity at high latitudes was in the magnetic zenith direction.\nThese factors, coupled with significant improvements in\ndetector technology, substantial increases in heater power,\nand favorable solar cycle conditions, have led to the\ndetection of several higher-energy optical emissions. These\ninclude: O(5P) 777.4 nm (excitation energy 10.74 eV)\n[Djuth et al., 2005], O(3P) 844.6 nm (10.99 eV) [Gustavsson\net al., 2005], and N2\n+ 427.8 nm (18.75 eV) [Holma et al.,\n2006; Gustavsson et al., 2006]. The detection of these\nemissions indicates electron acceleration to suprathermal\nenergies. A thermal interpretation would require excessively\nhigh electron temperatures in order to produce these relative-\nly higher-energy emissions [Gustavsson et al., 2002].\n[5] We present here observations of two previously\nunreported RIOEs: the O+ 732\u2013733 nm emission, with an\nexcitation energy of 1.69\u201318.61 eV, depending on the\nexcitation mechanism, and the O(3Do) 799.0 nm emission,\nwhich has an excitation energy of 12.49 eV. Also observed\nduring this experiment were the already documented O(3P)\n844.6 nm and O(5P) 777.4 nm RIOEs.\n2. Experiment Details\n[6] The High Power Auroral Stimulation (HIPAS) optical\ncampaign was carried out from 7\u201320 March 2007, at the\nHIPAS facility near Two Rivers, Alaska (64.9\u0001N, 146.8\u0001W).\nObservations presented here were obtained during the night\nof 19 March 2007, under clear skies. Geomagnetic con-\nditions were quiet: Kp for this period was 1\u0002 and 0+; for the\nprevious 24 hours Kp \u0003 1+. Absorption was negligible, as\nevinced by double-hop echoes on ionospheric sounding\nprofiles. During the period of brightest optical emissions,\nfoF2 was \u00013.5 MHz. The heater was transmitting O-mode,\nat a frequency of 2.85 MHz. This pump frequency was\napproximately equal to the local 2nd electron gyroharmonic\n(2fce) at F region heights. As noted by Kosch et al. [2005],\nradio-induced optical emissions maximize near 2fce, while\nminimizing at higher gyroharmonics.

Light was focused onto the CCD chip by an f\/1.4,\n85 mm focal length compound lens. The CCD chip was\ncooled to \u0002110\u0001C, significantly reducing the dark current,\nand leading to high signal-to-noise (S\/N) ratios. Other\ndiagnostics present for different periods of the campaign\nincluded several 630.0 nm and 557.7 nm imagers, and a\nDigisonde located at College, Alaska (\u000150 km away).\nRadar coverage was provided by the Kodiak SuperDARN\nHF radar and the Poker Flat Research Range (PFRR)\nAdvanced Modular Incoherent Scatter Radar (AMISR).\n3. Results\n[8] Figure 1 shows sample spectra recorded by the spec-\ntrometer. As previously noted, each heater on or off period\nwas 2 min long; however, the corresponding CCD scan time\nwas shortened by 15 s in order to permit image read-out at\nthe slowest possible rate. This significantly reduced the\nassociated read-out noise and improved the S\/N ratio. The\nfree spectral range of the instrument was \u0001180 nm, and\nthe wavelength-dependent full width half maximum\n(FWHM) was 0.6\u20132 nm. The resolution at higher wave-\nlengths was impaired by a focusing problem with the CCD\nlens. Prominent emission features in Figure 1a include the\nOH Meinel (8, 3), (9, 4), (5, 1) and (6, 2) bands starting at\n727, 775, 791, and 834 nm respectively. Also visible are the\nO2 Atm. (0, 0) band centered at 762 nm, and the O2 Atm.\n(0, 1) band at 859 nm. The solid spectrum is an average of\n3 consecutive up-B scans over HIPAS at 0544, 0550, and\n0556 UT, while the dotted spectrum is an average of 3\nconsecutive heater off scans (0546, 0552, and 0558 UT). It\nshould be noted that the heater-induced O+ and O emissions\nunderlie brighter spectral features and are not discernible\nfrom Figure 1a alone. The difference in brightness between\nthe on and off spectra in Figure 1a is not a heater-induced\neffect but is simply a changing background caused by the\nsetting Sun.\n[9] Figures 1b\u20131d show background-subtracted, calibrated\ndifference spectra in 10 nm bins surrounding the O+ 732\u2013\n733 nm, the O(5P) 777.4 nm, and the O(3P) 844.6 nm\nemissions. The difference spectrawere obtained by subtracting\nthe off spectrum from the on spectrum, and applying a\nbackground correction for each bin. The observed bright-\nness is in R\/nm, and the 777.4 nm and the 844.6 nm values\nagree well with the results of Djuth et al. [2005] and\nGustavsson et al. [2005], respectively. The 3s standard\ndeviation of the signal (99.7% confidence level) for each\nbin is shown as a horizontal dashed line. The emission\npeaks clearly stand out above the noise level.\n[10] Figure 2 further illustrates the presence of RIOEs.\nFigure 2a is a time series of the ionospheric critical\nfrequency, foF2. The horizontal dashed line denotes the\nheater pump frequency, fh, and the 2nd gyroharmonic,\n2fce, at 2.85 MHz. Pluses and diamonds in Figure 2b mark\nthe altitudes of the plasma resonance layer (PRL) and the\nupper hybrid resonance layer (UHRL), respectively. The\nPRL corresponds to the altitude at which the plasma\nfrequency, fp, matches the heater frequency. At this altitude,\nthe pump wave is reflected downward. The UHRL, which on\naverage was 12 km below the PRL, is the altitude where\nupper hybrid waves [e.g.,Hughes et al., 2003] are generated.\nThese waves, with a frequency fuh = ( f p2 + f ce\n2 )\n1\n2, are\nintimately associated with many ionospheric heating phe-\nnomena [e.g., Istomin and Leyser, 1995;Mishin et al., 2005],\nand are central in the production of heater-induced acceler-\nated electrons [Kosch et al., 2002]. Also shown in Figure 2b\nis the 2nd gyroharmonic altitude at \u0001245 km, as determined\nfrom the IGRF 10 model. The shadow height is demarcated\nby the diagonal line. The vertical lines 1 and 2 mark the\nplasma resonance and \u2018\u2018double resonance\u2019\u2019 conditions, re-\nspectively. Both are discussed below.\n[11] Time series of background-subtracted, normalized\noptical intensities, plotted in conjunction with the heater\nduty cycle are presented in Figures 2c\u20132g. Heating pulses\nabove PFRR are not included. The airglow intensity during\neach heater on and off period is divided by the intensity\nduring the off period, yielding a ratio Ri, which for en-\nhanced emissions is >1 during the on periods, and is always\n1 during the off periods. The degree of \u2018\u2018correlation\u2019\u2019\nbetween the heater and the emission enhancement is\nobtained by calculating the quantity C = S(Ri \u0002 1),\nsumming over all the on and off periods. Clearly, an\nunenhanced emission has Ri \u2019 1 and thus C \u0006 0. Con-\nversely, an emission modulated by the heater would be\nexpected to have Ri > 1, and C > 0, the magnitude of C\ndepending on the extent of the modulation. For this exper-\niment, the O(3P) 844.6 nm and the O(5P) 777.4 emissions\n(Figures 2c\u20132d) show the highest correlation. The O+ 732\u2013\n733 nm and the O(3Do) 799.0 nm (Figures 2e\u20132f) display a\nsomewhat weaker correlation, but modulation by the heater\nis still evident. Lastly, the P1(2) line of the OH(9, 4) band at\n779.4 nm (Figure 2g) shows a very low correlation and a\nlack of modulation by the heater.\n4. Discussion\n[12] The heater-induced O+ 732\u2013733 nm and O(3D0)\n799.0 nm emissions are discussed here. The metastable\nO+ 732\u2013733 nm multiplet emission arises from the\nO+(2Po) ! O+(2Do) transition [Sivjee et al., 1979]. Under\nauroral conditions, the (2Po) state, together with the (2Do)\nand the (ground) (4So) states are produced according to\nequation (1) in fractions of 0.2, 0.4 and 0.4, and requiring\n18.61, 16.92, and 13.61 eV respectively [Rees, 1989].\nO\u00fe e\u0002!2e\u00fe O\u00fe 2Po; 2Do; 4So\u0001 \u0002 \u00f01\u00de\n[13] Photoionization gives rise to the emission in the\ntwilight airglow spectrum [Meriwether et al., 1978], and\ngiven the position of the terminator in Figure 2b, it is\nL14103 MUTISO ET AL.: UNREPORTED HEATING-INDUCED OPTICAL EMISSIONS L14103\n2 of 6\nF\nig\nu\nre\n1\n.\nA\nir\ng\nlo\nw\nem\nis\nsi\no\nn\ns\nre\nco\nrd\ned\nat\nH\nIP\nA\nS\n.\n(a\n)\nS\nam\np\nle\nsp\nec\ntr\na\no\nb\nta\nin\ned\nd\nu\nri\nn\ng\nh\nea\nte\nr\no\nn\n(s\no\nli\nd\nli\nn\ne)\nan\nd\nh\nea\nte\nr\no\nff\n(d\no\ntt\ned\nli\nn\ne)\np\ner\nio\nd\ns.\nR\nad\nio\n-i\nn\nd\nu\nce\nd\no\np\nti\nca\nl\nem\nis\nsi\no\nn\ns\nd\nis\ncu\nss\ned\nin\nth\ne\nte\nx\nt\nu\nn\nd\ner\nli\ne\nb\nri\ng\nh\nte\nr\nsp\nec\ntr\nal\nfe\nat\nu\nre\ns\nin\nth\ne\nh\nig\nh\nli\ng\nh\nte\nd\nra\nn\ng\nes\n.\n(b\n)\u2013\n(d\n)\nB\nac\nk\ng\nro\nu\nn\nd\n-s\nu\nb\ntr\nac\nte\nd\n,\nca\nli\nb\nra\nte\nd\nd\nif\nfe\nre\nn\nce\nsp\nec\ntr\na,\nsh\no\nw\nin\ng\nra\nd\nio\n-i\nn\nd\nu\nce\nd\no\np\nti\nca\nl\nem\nis\nsi\no\nn\ns\nat\nse\nle\nct\ned\nre\ng\nio\nn\ns\no\nf\nin\nte\nre\nst\n.\nL14103 MUTISO ET AL.: UNREPORTED HEATING-INDUCED OPTICAL EMISSIONS L14103\n3 of 6\nF\nig\nu\nre\n2\n.\nIo\nn\no\nsp\nh\ner\nic\np\nar\nam\net\ner\ns\nan\nd\no\np\nti\nca\nl\nem\nis\nsi\no\nn\nti\nm\ne\nse\nri\nes\nfo\nr\n1\n9\nM\nar\nch\n2\n0\n0\n7\n.\n(a\n)\nT\nh\ne\nio\nn\no\nsp\nh\ner\nic\ncr\nit\nic\nal\nfr\neq\nu\nen\ncy\n,\nf o\nF\n2\n,\nd\ner\niv\ned\nfr\no\nm\na\nD\nig\nis\no\nn\nd\ne.\nT\nh\ne\nh\no\nri\nzo\nn\nta\nl\nd\nas\nh\ned\nli\nn\ne\nd\nen\no\nte\ns\nth\ne\nh\nea\nte\nr\np\nu\nm\np\nfr\neq\nu\nen\ncy\nan\nd\nth\ne\n2\nn\nd\ng\ny\nro\nh\nar\nm\no\nn\nic\n(2\nf c\ne\n),\nat\n2\n.8\n5\nM\nH\nz.\n(b\n)\nA\nlt\nit\nu\nd\nes\no\nf\nth\ne\np\nla\nsm\na\nre\nso\nn\nan\nce\nla\ny\ner\n(+\n)\nan\nd\nth\ne\nu\np\np\ner\nh\ny\nb\nri\nd\nre\nso\nn\nan\nce\nla\ny\ner\n(\u000b)\n.\nT\nh\ne\nh\no\nri\nzo\nn\nta\nl\nli\nn\ne\nat\n\u00012\n4\n5\nk\nm\nin\nd\nic\nat\nes\nth\ne\n2\nn\nd\ng\ny\nro\nh\nar\nm\no\nn\nic\nal\nti\ntu\nd\ne.\nT\nh\ne\nd\nia\ng\no\nn\nal\nli\nn\ne\nd\nem\nar\nca\nte\ns\nth\ne\nsh\nad\no\nw\nh\nei\ng\nh\nt.\nT\nh\ne\nv\ner\nti\nca\nll\nin\nes\n(1\n)\nan\nd\n(2\n)\nco\nrr\nes\np\no\nn\nd\nto\nth\ne\np\nla\nsm\na\nre\nso\nn\nan\nce\n(\u0001\n0\n6\n1\n3\nU\nT\n)\nan\nd\nth\ne\nd\no\nu\nb\nle\nre\nso\nn\nan\nce\n(\u0001\n0\n6\n3\n3\nU\nT\n)\nco\nn\nd\nit\nio\nn\ns\nre\nsp\nec\nti\nv\nel\ny.\n(c\n)\u2013\n(g\n)\nB\nac\nk\ng\nro\nu\nn\nd\n-s\nu\nb\ntr\nac\nte\nd\n,\nn\no\nrm\nal\niz\ned\no\np\nti\nca\nl\nin\nte\nn\nsi\nti\nes\nfo\nr\nv\nar\nio\nu\ns\nem\nis\nsi\no\nn\ns\np\nlo\ntt\ned\nin\nco\nn\nju\nn\nct\nio\nn\nw\nit\nh\nth\ne\nh\nea\nte\nr\nd\nu\nty\ncy\ncl\ne.\nT\nh\ne\nti\nm\ne\nse\nri\nes\nar\ne\nn\no\nrm\nal\niz\ned\nb\ny\nd\niv\nid\nin\ng\nth\ne\nem\nis\nsi\no\nn\nin\nte\nn\nsi\nty\nd\nu\nri\nn\ng\nth\ne\nh\nea\nte\nr\no\nn\nan\nd\no\nff\np\ner\nio\nd\ns\nb\ny\nth\ne\nin\nte\nn\nsi\nty\nd\nu\nri\nn\ng\nth\ne\nh\nea\nte\nr\no\nff\np\ner\nio\nd\n,\nfo\nr\nea\nch\np\nu\nm\np\ncy\ncl\ne.\nT\nh\ne\nd\neg\nre\ne\no\nf\n\u2018\u2018\nco\nrr\nel\nat\nio\nn\n\u2019\u2019\n(s\nee\nte\nx\nt\nfo\nr\nd\net\nai\nls\n)\nis\nal\nso\ng\niv\nen\n.\nL14103 MUTISO ET AL.: UNREPORTED HEATING-INDUCED OPTICAL EMISSIONS L14103\n4 of 6\napparent that our observed emissions were obtained from\nabove the shadow height. Nevertheless, the data presented\nin Figures 2c\u20132f show clear modulations by the heater.\nFurthermore, twilight conditions produce suprathermal pho-\ntoelectrons, and consequently, larger numbers of already\nenergetic electrons are available for acceleration than is\npossible with a Maxwellian distribution. We therefore\npropose that either (or both) of O+(4So)! O+(2Po) (requir-\ning 5.00 eV) or O+(2Do) ! O+(2Po) (1.69 eV) was caused\nby heater-induced electron acceleration and subsequent\nimpact excitation of O+. The reaction O + e ! 2e +\nO+(2Po) (18.61 eV) cannot be ruled out, since Gustavsson\net al. [2006] and Holma et al. [2006] have both observed\nheater-induced N2\n+ 427.8 nm (18.75 eV).\n[14] The O+ 732\u2013733 nm emission spectra can be con-\ntaminated by the P1(2) and the P2(3) lines of the OH(8, 3)\nband, and by auroral N2 1P (5, 3). The latter can be\ndiscounted on the basis that electron energies hard enough\nto produce N2 emissions would have led to markedly\ndifferent spectra. In addition, a 630.0 nm imager with a\ndetection threshold of 3.5 R acquired simultaneous airglow\nimages which show no background aurora. Regarding\npossible OH contamination of the O+ 732\u2013733 nm, the\nP1(2) line of the OH(9, 4) band at 779.4 nm shows no\nmodulation by the heater (Figure 2g). Thus, we expect no\nheater-induced modulation of the P1(2) and the P2(3) lines\nof the OH(8, 3) band. More significantly, OH production\npeaks at \u000187 km, over 100 km lower than the interaction\naltitudes determined here. We can therefore safely assume\nnegligible modulation by the heater, and hence no OH\nemissions should be present in the difference spectra.\n[15] The 799.0 nm multiplet is a weak auroral emission\ngenerated by the O(3Do) ! O(3P) transition. It contributes\nsignificantly via cascade excitation to the O(3P) 844.6 nm\nemission, and in bright aurora its intensity is \u00011% of the\nO(1S) 557.7 nm green line [Christensen et al., 1983]. The\nonly possible significant source of contamination for this\nemission is OH, which we have addressed above.\n[16] Djuth et al. [2005], Kosch et al. [2005], Mishin et al.\n[2005], and Kosch et al. [2007], among others, have\npresented data showing significant increases in optical emis-\nsion brightness when the plasma resonance (Figure 2b,\nvertical line 1, \u00010613 UT) and double resonance (vertical\nline 2, \u00010633 UT) conditions were met. At plasma reso-\nnance, fp = 2fce = fh. Similarly, the double resonance\ncondition is satisfied when fuh = 2fce = fh, that is, when\nthe heater frequency matches the second gyroharmonic, at\nthe upper hybrid resonance altitude. It is noteworthy that\nneither of these effects were observed in this experiment; in\nfact, the brightest emissions occurred approximately 1 hr\nbefore the double resonance condition. Simultaneous 630.0\nnm and 557.7 nm observations display the same behavior.\n[17] Ionospheric parameters were obtained from hand-\nfitted ionograms, which introduces a \u00b110 km uncertainty in\ncalculated ionospheric altitudes [Kosch et al., 2005]. Nev-\nertheless, taking this uncertainty into account would shift\nthe plasma resonance to 0550 UT at the earliest, and the\ndouble resonance to 0618 UT. This would still be later than\nthe period of maximum optical response starting at\n\u00010520 UT. In addition, any uncertainty due to the geo-\ngraphic separation of the Digisonde and the heater (1\u0001\nlongitude, \u000185 km at F region heights) is expected to be\nless than the \u00b110 km uncertainty introduced by the iono-\ngrams. This is because the observations were carried out\nduring quiet geomagnetic conditions and close to the\nterminator passage, so to first order the density gradients\nshould be following the Sun. Thus, an uncertainty of about\n4 minutes in the ionospheric parameters can be attributed to\nthe geographic separation of the heater and the Digisonde;\nthis still puts the maximum optical emissions outside the\nplasma resonance-double resonance window.\n[18] Given the pump frequency used and the timing of the\nemissions with respect to the various resonances, there are\nseveral candidate mechanisms that could have generated the\nobserved RIOEs. Chiefly, the parametric decay of the pump\nwave into Langmuir (L) and ion acoustic (IA) waves, PDIL,\nis a well-known occurrence that efficiently accelerates\nelectrons via Langmuir turbulence [Fejer, 1979]. This\nmechanism has been theoretically predicted by Gurevich\net al. [2002] for pumping outside the Spitze cone (\u00017.5\u0001 at\nHIPAS), and ample experimental evidence exists [e.g.,\nKosch et al., 2007, and references therein]. Also plausible\nis that the parametric decay (PDIEB) of the pump wave into\nelectron Bernstein waves (EB) and lower hybrid (LH)\nwaves [e.g., Mishin et al., 2005; Kosch et al., 2007] was\nin effect. The likely presence of suprathermal photoelec-\ntrons would have enhanced the airglow production of both\nmechanisms.\n[19] In conclusion, we have presented spectroscopic\nobservations of the previously unreported O+ 732\u2013733\nnm and O(3Do) 799.0 nm radio-induced optical emissions.\nOther documented RIOEs were also observed. All the\nemissions were detected in the magnetic zenith during O-\nmode F region heating at 2.85 MHz, and they display\nmoderate to strong synchronization with the heater duty\ncycle. The generation of the emissions before double\nresonance favors a PDIL or PDIEB interpretation.\n[20] Acknowledgments. This research was supported by Embry-\nRiddle Internal grant ERAU13213.
