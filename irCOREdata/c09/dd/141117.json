Aspergillus was consistently the most frequent genus in seeds and in-\nshell peanuts and was the dominant mycotoxigenic component of the mycobiota.\nThere was no direct correlation between the moisture content of the samples and\nthe fungal populations on peanut seeds tested from different regions. The most\ncommon species were from Aspergillus section Flavi (4.7-78.3%), Aspergillus\nsection Nigri (9.4-52.6%) and Aspergillus section Circumdati (5.1-30.9%). In the in-\nshell peanut samples the lowest populations were recorded in El-Beheira and\nAsyut (3.7-4.0 log10 CFU g-1) and the highest in Alexandria and Elsharqiya (4.1-6.0\nlog10 CFU g-1). Aspergillus section Flavi and section Nigri were the most dominant\nand Aspergillus section Circumdati were only found in samples in 2008. Both\nqualitative (coconut cream agar) and quantitative analyses (HPLC) were used to\nanalyse the potential mycotoxin production by strains isolated from peanuts. Of a\ntotal of 88 Aspergillus section Flavi strains examined, 95% were A. flavus based on\nproduction of aflatoxin B1 on YES medium and confirmation using molecular\nanalyses. Of 64 Aspergillus section Circumdati strains only 28% produced\nochratoxin A (OTA), and were identified as A. westerdijkiae. No Aspergillus section\nNigri strains produced OTA, and they were identified as A. niger (uniseriate). The\npresence of these toxigenic fungi indicates that there is a potential risk of\nmycotoxin contamination in Egyptian peanuts and suggests that problems can\narise from contamination with both aflatoxins, and perhaps also OTA.\nIntroduction\nThe mycotoxins produced by Aspergillus spp. of greatest significance in\npeanuts (Arachis hypogaea L.) and peanut products include aflatoxins and\n2ochratoxin A (OTA) (Pittet 1998). Peanuts are important substrates for the growth\nand subsequent aflatoxin production by different members of Aspergillus section\nFlavi: A. flavus Link, A. parasiticus Speare, A. nomius, A. pseudotamarii and A.\nbombycis. Recently, additional new aflatoxin producing species have been isolated\nfrom peanuts in Argentina (A.arachidicola sp. nov. and A.minisclerotigenes sp. nov\n(Pildain et al. 2008). The commonest species can infect peanuts and maize both\npre- and post-harvest (Cotty, 1997; Barros et al. 2003). Usually, aflatoxin\ncontamination pre-harvest occurs under conditions of heat and drought stress\nduring the latter stages of the growing season (Hill and Lacey 1983; Blankenship\net al. 1984; Dorner and Cole 2002). Because peanuts are primarily used for food,\nstrict regulatory limits for the amount of aflatoxin in peanut products have been\nestablished. For raw peanuts entering the EU, the level must be <4 \u00b5g kg-1 total\naflatoxins and have not more than 2 \u00b5g kg-1 B1 (European Commission 2006).\nEgypt is a major peanut exporting country and the European markets account\nfor 68% of its peanut exports. Its production has increased steadily, as a result of\nincreased growing areas as well as significant increases in yields during the last\ntwo decades (1990 to 2005) from 2.1 to 3.1 t ha-1 (Diaz Rios and Jafee 2008).\nPeanuts are grown mostly in the north of the country. There are a large number of\npeanut producers, with many small holders resulting in an overall peanut cultivation\narea covering 61,000 ha (FAO 2003). Although some studies, especially in South\nAmerica, have isolated ochratoxigenic fungi from peanuts, there are no legislative\nlimits for this mycotoxin in peanuts or derived products although these are in place\nfor cereals (Van Egmond 2004).\nIn May, 1999 the European Commission suspended the import of peanuts from\nEgypt due to the presence of aflatoxins in concentrations in excess of the\nmaximum levels specified in the EU regulations. Since then the Egyptian\nGovernment has been actively trying to reduce the aflatoxin content in peanuts.\nSince 2003, the EU only required random sampling in 20% of peanut\nconsignments imported from Egypt for aflatoxin B1 and total aflatoxins.\nSubsequently, Egypt has increased its market share in 2005 by >60 M US$ (Diaz\nRios and Jafee 2008).\nThere have been previous studies on the mycobiota contamination of Egyptian\npeanuts (Mobasher et al. 1979; Moubasher et al. 1980; El-Hissy et al. 1981; El-\nMaghraby and El-Maraghy 1987; El-Magraby and El-Maraghy 1988; Youssef et al.\n2008). However, none of these studies compared the toxigenic potential of the\nstrains in peanut samples from different regions of Egypt. Furthermore, where\nmycotoxin analyses were carried out this was qualitative only predominantly using\nTLC, with very limited quantification of aflatoxins, or other mycotoxigenic fungi\npresent. For example, recent studies in Argentina have found that Aspergillus\ncarbonarius was commonly isolated from peanuts under South American\ncultivation conditions and that many of the strains isolated could produce\nochratoxin A (OTA) (Magnoli et al. 2007). No information is available on the\nisolation of Aspergillus section Circumdati species, or Aspergillus section Nigri and\nwhether these may produce OTA.\nThe objectives of this study were to (a) identify the dominant mycotoxigenic\nfungi in Egyptian peanuts (in shell, and seeds) in two seasons (2007, 2008) in five\ndifferent regions of Egypt and (b) to examine and quantify the contributions of the\nmycotoxgenic fungi to the total populations, and (c) to examine the relative ratios of\nspecies from Aspergillus section Flavi, Aspergillus section Nigri and Aspergillus\nsection Circumdati which were able to produce aflatoxins and OTA.\n3Material and methods\nCollection of peanut samples\nTriplicate raw peanut in shell samples (each 500 g) were collected after harvest in\ntwo seasons (2007, 2008) from five provinces in Egypt (Alexandria, El-Beheira, El-\nDaqahliya, El-Sharqiya, all from northern Egypt; and Asyut from southern Egypt).\nHalf of each sample was shelled in a sterile flow bench to obtain the peanut seeds\nfor mycobiota analyses. Samples were kept at 4\u00b0C, until fungal enumeration.\nDetermination of water activity and moisture content of peanuts\nThe water activity (aw) of the peanut in shell and peanut seed samples was\ndetermined using the AquaLab 3TE (Decagon Devices, Inc., Pullman,\nWashington, USA). A 10 grams sub-sample of each replicate was also oven dried\nat 105\u00b0C for 24 h, and then cooled in desiccators and re-weighed to a constant\nweight. The moisture content (MC) was calculated as the percentage of the wet\nweight (Deshpande et al. 1993).\nMycotoxigenic fungi isolation from samples\nDirect plating: A total of 45 peanut seeds (5 x 3 x 3 replicates) were direct plated\nonto Petri plates of Malt Extract Agar (MEA, Oxoid, Basingstoke, Hampshire, U.K.),\nDichloran 18% glycerol agar (DG18, Oxoid) and MEA + 10% NaCl (0.95 aw, MS;\nOxoid) from each region. After incubation at 25\u00b0C for 7 days, the frequency of fungi\nwas recorded. The isolates of Aspergillus section Flavi, Aspergillus section Nigri\nand Aspergillus section Circumdati were recovered from the peanut seeds and\nmaintained on slants of MEA at 4\u00b0C, until examination for their toxigenic potential.\nSerial dilutions: The colonization was assessed as CFU g-1 of dry weight\npeanut in-shell samples. Triplicate 10g sub-samples from each region were\nweighed in stomacher bags containing 90 ml of distilled water and left for 10 min to\nsoak. A total of four samples were homogenised for 15 min in the Colworth\nStomacher 400. Serial dilutions (10-2, 10-3, 10-4) were done and 200 \u00b5l from each\ndilution spread plated on MEA, DG18 and MS agar in triplicate. The plates were\nincubated at 25\u00b0C for 7-10 days and examined periodically. A colony counter was\nused for total counts and microscopic examinations were made for fungal genera\nclassification. Individual colonies were sub-cultured for detailed examination. Data\nobtained on DG18 and MS showed no statistically significant differences so data\nfor only one of these media is presented.\nFor identification of species, comparisons were made with type strains from\nculture collections and reference to Pitt and Hocking (2009). Type strains in our\nlaboratories included Aspergillus flavus (SRKC-G1907; USDA,USA); A. parasiticus\n(SSWT 2999, USA), Aspergillus carbonarius (IMI 388653), Aspergillus niger. var\nniger (biseriate; IMI 388550); A. niger var. niger (uniseriate, IMI 387209),\nAspergillus westerdijkiae (IBT 21991), A. steynii (IBT 22339), and A. ochraceus\n(IBT 11952).\nEvaluation of toxigenic potential and identification\n4Two methods were used to assess this. We used a medium-based qualitative\nsystem and HPLC analyses for quantification of aflatoxins and ochratoxin A (OTA)\nproduction and molecular identification of Aspergillus section Flavi strains.\nSpecies from the Aspergillus section Flavi, Aspergillus section Nigiri and\nAspergillus section Circumdati isolated from peanut seeds were tested,\nrespectively, for their ability to produce aflatoxins (B1, B2, G1, G2; AFs) or OTA in\ncoconut cream agar 50% (Dyer and McCammon 1994). The reverse side of the\ncolony was observed daily for 6 days at 25\u00b0C under ultraviolet light at 365 nm in a\ndark cabinet to verify the presence of a blue fluorescent ring, an indication of the\npresence of AFs or OTA, thus characterizing it as a toxigenic strain.\nQuantitative analyses of mycotoxins\nAFs and OTA analyses was done using HPLC: Three replicates of the\npeanut samples from each region were analysed for AFs in the two seasons by\nextraction using aflaprep columns (Neogene Europe, wide bore). For the strains\nisolated from peanuts three to five plugs were extracted from each colony after 10\ndays incubation at 25\u00b0C on Yeast Extract Sucrose Agar (YES, Fisher,\nLoughborough, Leicestershire, U.K.) , transferred to a 2ml Eppendorf tube and\nweighed (Filtenborg and Frisvad 1980). For aflatoxin extraction, 800 \u03bcl chloroform\nwas added to each Eppendorf and shaken well for 1 hour. The chloroform extract\nwas transferred to a new vial and dried gently under air for derivatization using the\nAOAC method (2000) and then analysed quantitatively using HPLC. A 200 \u00b5l\nstock solution of Aflatoxin mix standard in methanol (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA USA)\n,containing 200 ng B1, 60 ng B2, 200 ng G1 and 60 ng G1, was dried under\nnitrogen gas and derivatized as for samples. Four concentrations were prepared\nfor HPLC injection. For OTA extraction, 750 \u03bcl methanol was added, the sample\nshaken for 30 minutes and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 15000xg. After filtration of\nthe supernatant, the samples were analysed by HPLC. OTA 50 \u00b5g ml-1\nbenzene:acetic acid (99:1, Supelco, Bellefonte, PA., USA) was used. 50 ul of the\nstock was evaporated under nitrogen and dissolved with methanol to inject 10 ul\nfrom four different concentration (125, 250, 375, 500 ng ml-1). Detection limit of\nAFB1 using HPLC was 0.012 and 0.8 ng g-1 peanut seeds and YES media\nrespectively whereas detection limit of OTA in YES media was 0.4 ng g-1 YES\nmedia.\nHPLC conditions: The HPLC system used for AFs and OTA analyses\nwas an Agilent 1200 series system (Agilent, Berks., UK) with a fluorescence\ndetector (FLD G1321A), an auto sampler ALS G1329A, FC\/ALS therm G1330B,\nDegasser G1379B, Bin Bump G1312A and a C18 (Phenomonex, Luna 5 micron,\n150 x 4.6 mm) column joined to a pre- column (security guard, 4x3mm cartridge,\nPhenomenex Luna). The mobile phase was methanol:water:acetonitrile (30:60:10,\nv\/v\/v) using an isocratic flow rate of 1ml min-1 at 360 nm excitation and 440 nm\nemission wavelengths and a 25 min run time for AFs analyses. For OTA analyses,\nacetonitrile (57%): water (41%): acetic acid (2%) were isocratically used at the\nsame flow rate at 333 nm excitation, 460 nm emission wavelengths. The run time\nfor samples was 15 min with OTA being detected at 5.75 min.\nMolecular discrimination of A. flavus and A. parasiticus\nDNA extraction and PCR amplification: Genomic DNA of the strains was obtained\nusing the DNAeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to the\n5manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Differentiation between A. flavus and A. parasiticus\nstrains isolated from Egyptian peanut samples was carried out according to\nGonz\u00e1lez-Salgado et al. (2008). A pair of primers (Invetrogen), FLA1 (5\u00b4-\nGTAGGGTTCCTAGCGAGCC-3\u00b4) and FLA2 (5\u00b4-\nGGAAAAAGATTGATTTGCGTTC-3\u00b4), specific to A. flavus was used for that\ndifferentiation. PCR reactions were performed in 0.2 ml PCR Eppendorf (Starlab\nLtd, Milton Keynes, UK) using an Alpha Unit TM Block Assembly for PTC DNA\nEngine TM Systems (MJ Research Inc., Waltham, USA). The PCR amplification\nprotocol was as follows: 1 cycle of 5 min at 95\u00b0C, 26 cycles of 30s at 95\u00b0C\n(denaturation), 30 s at 58\u00b0C (annealing), 45 s at 72\u00b0C (extension) and, finally, 1\ncycle of 5 min at 72\u00b0C. Amplification reactions were carried out in volumes of 25 ml\ncontaining 1\u00b5l of template DNA, 0.25 \u00b5l of each primer (100 \u00b5M), 2.5 \u00b5l of 10xPCR\nbuffer, 2 \u00b5l of MgCl2 (25 mM), 0.625 \u00b5l of dNTPs (40mM) and 0.2 \u00b5l of Taq DNA\npolymerase (5U\u00b5l-1) supplied by Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). PCR products were\ndetected on 2% agarose ethidiumbromide gels in TAE 1xbuffer (Tris\u2013acetate\n40mM and EDTA 1.0 mM). The 100-bp DNA ladder (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)\nwas used as the molecular size marker. Genomic DNA samples used in this work\nwere tested using the transcription of the housekeeping gene (\u03b2-tubulin), Tub1-F\n(5\u00b4-GTCCGGTGCTGGTAACAACT-3\u00b4) and Tub1-R (5\u00b4-\nGGAGGTGGAGTTTCCAATGA-3\u00b4), obtained from IDT (Integrated DNA\nTechnology Inc. Iowa, USA) as a control. The PCR amplification protocol was as\npreviously detailed except for the changing of the annealing temperature to 65\u00b0C\nand the number of denaturation cycles to 35.\nThe references strains used in this work were A. flavus SRKC-G1907, A.\nflavus A 2092, A. parasiticus SSWT BN009-E, and A. parasiticus SSWT 2999. We\nare grateful to Dr. D. Bhatnagar and Dr. P. Cotty for supply of strains).\nStatistical analysis\nData on populations of mycotoxigenic fungi and total counts (CFU g-1 of dry weight\npeanut in-shell) on DG18 and MS medium were logarithmically transformed before\nstatistical analysis. This was required because of the wide range of variability (from\nsingle-digit numbers to numbers in hundreds\/thousands) (Clewer and Scarisbrick\n2001). Statistical significance were determined using Statistica version 9 (StatSoft\nInc., Tulsa, OK, USA). Means of log CFU units were determined by analysis of\nvariance (ANOVA, tow and three ways) (p<0.05). Fisher\u2019s LSD Method (\u03b1=0.05)\nwas applied to compare significant differences between regions and seasons.\nResults and Discussion\nWater activity and moisture content of peanut samples\nWater activity levels (aw) and moisture contents (MC%) were measured in an\nattempt to find any correlation with the fungal density of peanut samples from\ndifferent regions of Egypt in 2007 and 2008 (Table 1). Values of either aw or MC%\nof in-shell peanuts and seeds from each region were similar. Most of the samples\nhad <0.59 aw and 9.3% moisture content respectively. However, samples from\nAlexandria and El-Sharqiya in 2008 had the highest values (0.89-0.91 aw, 23.4-\n26.1% moisture content). Only in these two areas in 2008 were conditions\nconducive to colonisation by A. flavus and AFs contamination which can occur at\n>0.78-0.8 aw (Lacey et al. 1991; Sanchis and Magan, 2004). The background\naflatoxin B1 concentrations found in the peanuts in 2007 and 2008 were however\nvery low with the range being 0.8-0.41 and 0.09 to 0.23 \u00b5g kg-1 respectively.\n6Previous studies from markets as opposed to directly from farmers, also suggest\nthat Aspergillus spp. are predominant in Egypt (Moubasher et al. 1979; El-\nMaghraby and El-Maraghy, 1987, 1988; Youssef et al. 2008).\nFrequency of isolation and populations of mycotoxigenic fungi in peanuts from\ndifferent geographic regions of Egypt in two seasons\nTable 2 shows the populations (log10 CFU g-1 of in-shell peanut sample) of\nmycotoxigenic fungi and the total fungal populations from the five Egyptian regions\nin 2007 and 2008. Overall, the total fungal populations of samples collected in\n2008, in particular from Alexandria and El-Sharqiya, was significantly higher when\ncompared with 2007. High populations of Cladosporium and Penicillium species\nwere present in samples from Alexandria and El-Sharqiya in 2008 (4-5 log units g-\n1). However, Wallemia sebi, yeasts, Acremonium species were present in samples\nfrom the other regions in both seasons. Aspergillus section Flavi and Aspergillus\nsection Nigri groups were the most prevalent mycotoxigenic fungi in both seasons.\nSamples from Alexandria and El-Sharqiya collected in 2008 had the highest total\npopulations among the regions examined, and subsequently the highest\npopulations of mycotoxigenic fungi. The Aspergillus section Circumdati group were\nonly found in samples from the 2008 season (0.7 - 4.8 log10 units g-1).\nAspergillus section Circumdati was observed from all regions in 2008, but\nnone in 2007. However, the other two mycotoxigenic groups were isolated in 2.9-\n5.6 and 2.6-4.7 log units g-1 respectively for the two seasons. A similar frequency\nwas also found by Gon\u00e7alez et al. (2008) for A. flavus in full pod maturity (33.6%).\nIn Brazil, Nakai et al. (2008) reported that in kernels, in addition to A. flavus\n(21.2%), A. niger was isolated but at a very low frequency (0.6%). However, they\nfound that among representatives of the genus Aspergillus, only A. flavus (10.3%)\nwere isolated from shells. Moubasher et al. (1979) found A. flavus to constitute\n16.1, 8.4 and 27.2% of the total count in the shells, in covered and uncovered\npeanut seeds respectively. They also found that A. niger was recorded from 95%\nof peanut samples tested, constituting 20.7% of the total fungi and 35% of the total\nAspergillus. Previously, El-Maghraby and El-Maraghy (1987) found A. flavus and\nA. niger comprised only 8.1 and 2.2% of the total fungi in Egyptian peanuts. With\nregard to Aspergillus section Circumdati group, Tripathi and Kumar (2007) found\nthem to be present in only 12.7% of the total fungi in India. However, none of the\nstudies in Egypt examined potential for mycotoxin production by these genera.\nTable 3 shows the statistical analyses of the single and interaction between\nsingle factors of mycotoxigenic groups in relation to region and season. This shows\nthat these were statistically significant effects of region and season on Aspergillus\nsection Flavi, while for Aspergillus section Nigri season had no effect.\nFigure 1 shows the frequency of isolation of the mycotoxigenic fungal\ngroups from peanut seeds in the different regions in 2007 and 2008. The frequency\nof these fungal groups ranged from 0 to 78.3 and from 4.7 to 52.6% collected in the\ntwo years. Generally, the percentage of Aspergillus section Flavi, Aspergillus\nsection Nigri and Aspergillus section Circumdati groups in 2007 was higher than\nthat isolated in 2008. In 2007, Aspergillus section Flavi group represented 78, 44,\n27, and 25% of the total count in samples from El-Daqahelaya, Alexandria, El-\nBeheira, El-Sharqiya regions respectively. While, there was none found in samples\nfrom the southern region (Asyut). However, they were contaminated with\nAspergillus section Circumdati (33%) in addition to Eurotium and Alternaria as the\n7dominant other genera (33 and 25% respectively). The second most important\ngroup was Aspergillus section Nigri which can produce OTA. Peanut seeds from\nEl-Beheira contained the highest percentage frequency of Aspergillus section Nigri\n(45%) with the other regions having less in 2008. The frequency of isolation of\nEurotium and Acremonium species from all regions was high when compared to\nthat of the Aspergillus section Flavi group (4.7-10.2%), Aspergillus section\nCircumdati group (5.1-21.2%) and Aspergillus section Nigri groups (9.4-52.6%).\nXerophilic Eurotium species represented 26%, 47% and 70% of the total fungal\ncount in samples from El-Beheira, El-Daqahliya and Asyut region, respectively.\nHowever, Acremonium was dominant in Alexandria and El-Sharqiya samples.\nEl-Maghraby and El-Maraghy (1988) and Youssef et al. (2008) reported that\nA. flavus represented 4 and 4.9% respectively of the total fungi on untreated\nseeds. In the present study Aspergillus section Circumdati group represented 5.1-\n21.2% of mycobiota populations in samples from all regions except from El-\nBeheira. In contrast, Yousef et al. (2008) did not find any Aspergillus section\nCircumdati group in peanut samples. In 2008, in the Alexandria and El-Sharqiya\nsamples a higher frequency of Penicillium and Acremonium species were found in\ncontrast to 2007 where Eurotium species were dominant. This may be linked to the\nhigher aw of these samples. This also suggests that samples from these regions\nwere stored poorly after harvest (Pitt and Hocking 1997).\nToxigenic potential of isolated strains of mycotoxigenic genera\nScreening of fungi isolated from peanut seeds for aflatoxin production by the\nfluorescence method on coconut cream agar medium revealed that among 56 and\n32 Aspergillus section Flavi isolates in 2007 and 2008 almost all except for 6 and 8\nstrains respectively, produced a blue fluorescence (Table 4). The same medium\nwas also used to examine Aspergillus section Nigri and Aspergillus section\nCircumdati isolates for ochratoxin A (OTA) production. No blue fluorescence was\nobserved in any of the former group isolates tested (28 and 50 isolates in 2007 and\n2008). Of the Aspergillus section Circumdati isolates in 2007 and 2008 (12 and 52\nrespectively) 42 and 25 %, were ochratoxigenic.\nA total of 88 Aspergillus section Flavi isolates were tested by HPLC for\nquantification of the ability to produce aflatoxins (AFAs; B1, B2, G1, G2). A further\n64 Aspergillus section Circumdati and 78 Aspergillus section Nigri were screened\nfor production of OTA on a conducive YES medium. Table 4 also shows that there\nwere differences between the qualitative and quantitative methods. For example, of\n88 Aspergillus section Flavi isolates only 5 gave false negative results. For\nAspergillus section Circumdati of 64 isolates, only 4 gave a false positive in the two\nseasons when compared with HPLC results. The mean aflatoxigenic Aspergillus\nsection Flavi isolates for both seasons was 90% based on HPLC analysis. The\nconcentrations of aflatoxin B1 produced ranged from 10 to 100,000 ng g-1.\nHowever, 2 (2.3%) isolates were able to produce AFB1 >100,000 ng g-1. The mean\npercentage ochratoxigenic Aspergillus section Circumdati isolates was 28% and\nthe concentration range of OTA was from 1-3000 ng g-1. None of the 78 Aspergillus\nsection Nigri isolates produced OTA. This suggests that most of the isolates from\nthese groups were, respectively, A. flavus, A. westerdijkiae and A. niger\n(uniseriate).\nMolecular analyses of Aspergillus section Flavi strains isolated from\nEgyptian peanuts were further tested using the primer pair FLA1 and FLA2. A\n8single fragment of about 500 bp was only amplified when genomic DNA from A.\nflavus strains was used, but not from A. parasiticus strains where no product was\nobserved. More than 95% of the tested Aspergillus section Flavi were A. flavus and\nthis is shown in Figure 2 as an example of the results. Isolate in lane 16 was A.\nparasiticus and non-aflatoxigenic as well. These result confirmed those obtained\nfrom analysis of isolates on YES medium for AFAs. This showed that all the\naflatoxigenic isolates produced AFB1 and B2 and none produced AFG1 and G2.\nThere was approximately 90% compatibility of the results between coconut\nagar method and HPLC. Similar results were obtained by Giorni et al. (2006) who\nfound that 73% of Aspergillus section Flavi strains isolated from maize showed\nfluorescence when inoculated on Coconut extract agar and 70% of strains were\npositive when tested by HPLC. For both seasons, the mean Aspergillus section\nFlavi isolates producing aflatoxins was 89.3%, and for ochratoxin A, 33.5% of\nAspergillus section Circumdati isolates. However, no Aspergillus section Nigri\ngroup produced OTA. Nakai et al. (2008) found in Brazil that 93.8% of Aspergillus\nsection Flavi isolated from Brazilian peanuts produced aflatoxins. Also, S\u00e1nchez-\nHarv\u00e1s et al. (2008) reported 64.1% of isolates from cocoa beans produced\naflatoxins. The results for OTA production by Aspergillus section Nigri and\nAspergillus section Circumdati group in this study differ from those obtained by\nS\u00e1nchez-Harv\u00e1s et al. (2008) who found that 49.2% of black Aspergilli strains were\nable to produce OTA in cocoa beans and suggested that Aspergillus section\nCircumdati is probably a relatively unimportant source of OTA in cocoa production.\nIn contrast, Recently, Aspergillus section Circumdati species, especially A.\nwesterdijkiae, were found to be commonly present on coffee beans (Noomin et al.\n2008). Magnoli et al. (2007) reported that 32% of Aspergillus section Nigri isolated\nfrom Argentinean peanut seeds were OTA producers in culture. Additionally,\nBayman et al. (2002) demonstrated that none of the isolates of Aspergillus section\nCircumdati or Aspergillus melleus from tree nuts and fig orchards produced OTA,\nalthough all isolates of Aspergillus alliaceus did produce the toxin. This is unusual\nas Aspergillus section Nigri isolates normally contaminate grapes, grape products\nand wine with OTA (Mateo et al. 2007).\nIn conclusion the present study demonstrated the susceptibility of Egyptian\npeanut to colonization with Aspergillus section Flavi, especially A. flavus isolates,\nAspergillus section Nigri and Aspergillus section Circumdati groups as dominant\nfungi from different regions of Egypt. The aw of the samples, season, and regions\nwere important factors affecting the fungal populations. It may be important to not\noverlook the presence of ochratoxigenic fungi (28%) in peanuts in addition to\naflatoxigenic species (90%) and to perhaps formulate guidelines for OTA as well.\nAspergillus section Nigri group isolates from Egypt were unable to produce OTA in\npeanuts. This contrasts with results from South America. Poor post-harvest storage\nof peanuts in Egypt could increase the risk from contamination with aflatoxins\nabove the EU legislative limits.\n9REFERENCES\nAOAC (2000) Association of Official Analytical Chemist, Official methods of\nanalysis.
