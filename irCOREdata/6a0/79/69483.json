Introduction \nSimple hydroxamic acids (XHA) are hydrophilic organic compounds with the general \nformula RCONHOH and so can act as O,O donor ligands with high affinities for hard \ncations such as Fe3+, Np4+ and Pu4+ with which they form 5 membered chelate rings \n[1-3]. \nThey have a wide range of applications in many fields, including as enzyme \ninhibitors, soil enhancers, fungicides, mutagens, carcinogens, DNA cleavers, drug \ndelivery systems [4], ion exchange [5] and materials research [4]. Siderophores such \nas the desferrioxamines contain multiple hydroxamate functionalities and are naturally \noccurring ligands specifically used by fungi for the sequestration of iron from the \nenvironment [6-8]. The potential role of such hydroxamate siderophores in the \nmobilisation of actinide ions within the environment has also been considered [9]. \nMore recently, XHAs have also been identified as useful reagents for the control of Pu \nand Np in advanced Purex and UREX processes proposed for the processing of spent \nnuclear fuel [10]. In such separation processes, U, Np and Pu are separated according \nto oxidation state specific aqueous\/non aqueous solvent extraction in the presence of \naceto-hydroxamic acid [3]. \nIt is also well known that hydroxamic acids are susceptible to hydrolysis, particularly \nin acidic solutions [4]. Whilst there have been many studies of hydroxamic acid \nhydrolysis and their complexation reactions with Fe(III) ions, there have been \nrelatively few studies of the stability of the Fe(III)-hydroxamate complexes towards \nhydrolysis. We have previously reported on the kinetics of the hydrolysis of \nhydroxamic acids both in free solution and when bound to metal ions and developed a \nkinetic model describing this process at ambient temperatures [11,13]. However, the \n 3\nAcetohydroxamatoiron (III) complexes  Andrieux et al. \napplications of hydroxamic acids in biological-related fields requires an understanding \nof the behaviour of these systems at temperature of biological interest, for example in \nvivo (310K) or temperatures at which proteins start to denature ( ~ 325K) [14]. \nAdditionally, the temperature dependencies of the equilibrium constants are useful in \ngaining a better understanding of the complexation processes and the role of enthalpy \nand entropy in complex formation. As a precursor to any temperature-dependent study \nof Fe(III)-AHA hydrolysis, comprehensive and reliable thermodynamic data are \nrequired on the Fe(III)-AHA complexation reactions, which is the focus of this report. \nFurthermore, we are applying the kinetic models developed for the Fe(III)-AHA \nsystem to the kinetics of the hydrolysis of hydroxamic acids when bound to actinide \nions such as Pu4+ and Np4+ in support of advanced Purex and UREX processes [12]. \nIn this context, Fe(III) is a useful non-radioactive analogue for interrogating the \ncomplexation behaviour of actinides. \nThus, a study of the temperature dependence of the speciation of the Fe3+\u2013AHA \nsystem will both provide a useful addition to the thermodynamic database of Fe(III) in \nits own right and support advanced Purex\/UREX process development through its role \nas a non-active analogue of e.g. the Np4+\u2013AHA system.  \nAs mentioned previously, hydroxamic acids readily form stable complexes with Fe3+ \nions according to reactions described in eqs. 1-3: \n    1K3 2Fe HL FeL H+ +\u23af\u23af\u2192+ +\u2190\u23af\u23af +\n2\n1 3\n[FeL ][H ]K\n[Fe ][HL]\n+ +\n+=   (1) \n   2K2 2FeL HL FeL H+ +\u23af\u23af\u23af\u2192+ +\u2190\u23af\u23af + 22 2\n[FeL ][H ]K\n[FeL ][HL]\n+ +\n+=   (2) \n 4\nAcetohydroxamatoiron (III) complexes  Andrieux et al. \n    3K2 3FeL HL FeL H+ +\u23af\u23af\u2192+ +\u2190\u23af\u23af 33\n2\n[FeL ][H ]K\n[FeL ][HL]\n+\n+=   (3) \nwhere L represents the deprotonated acetohydroxamato ligand and all equilibrium \nconstants are calculated from concentrations rather than activities. \nValues of the equilibrium constant for the formation of the \nmonoacetohydroxamatoiron(III) complex were reported in the literature with Monzyk \net al. [8] suggesting K1 = 109 without specifying an equilibrium temperature, while \nSchwarzenbach et al. [15] report a value for the log K1 = 2.28 at 293 K, corresponding \nto K1 = 190.5. The inconsistency of these values together with a lack of data \npertaining to their temperature dependence has prompted us to conduct our own \ndetermination of values for K1, K2 and K3. This, we have done through measurement \nof the electronic absorption spectra (EAS) of a range of mixtures of the three Fe(III)-\nAHA complexes and the development of a simple analytical method for the extraction \nof values of equilibrium constants from those spectra. We have also deployed this \nmethod for the measurement of the temperature dependence of these equilibrium \nconstants prior to the construction of useful temperature dependent speciation \ndiagrams. \n \n2. Experimental Methods \n2.1. Materials \nAll reagents, including HNO3 (70%, AnalaR, BDH Chemicals Ltd., Poole, Dorset, \nUK) and AHA (Sigma-Aldrich Ltd, UK) were obtained from reputable suppliers \n(Aldrich, Fluka) at the highest available purity and used as received. AHA was stored \n 5\nAcetohydroxamatoiron (III) complexes  Andrieux et al. \nin a refrigerator at 4 \u00b0C in order to prevent its decomposition. Solutions were prepared \nusing doubly distilled water, produced by a home-made still and further purified by a \ndeionisation system (E pure model 04642, Barnstead \/ Thermodyne, Dubuque, Iowa, \nUSA) to a resistivity of 1.8 x 105 \u03a9 m. \n2.2. Experimental limitations derived from Iron(III) hydrolysis. \nIt is well known that Fe3+ readily hydrolyses in water in accordance with: \n3\n2Fe H O FeOH H\n+ \u23af\u23af\u2192+ \u2190\u23af 2+ ++       (4) \nThis equilibrium is the first step in a series of deprotonation \/ polymerisation reactions \nthat ultimately result in the formation of ferric hydroxides and oxyhydroxides. Using \nthe most recently published, critically assessed Gibbs energies of formation of the \nvarious species involved [16,17], the equilibrium constant for this first deprotonation \ncan be calculated as being equal to 6.78 x 10-3 at 298 K, corresponding to a pKa(Fe3+) \nof 2.17. Thus, as hydrolysis to form Fe(OH)2+ will become significant above pH = \n2.17 at 298 K, only those data recorded at pH = 2.1 and below at this temperature will \nbe subjected to rigorous experimental interpretation and analysis.  \nHowever, our study extends beyond T = 298 K to determine the temperature \ndependence of K1-K3 in the temperature range 293-323 K. The equilibrium constant \nfor the reaction shown in eq. 4 has been studied as a function of temperature (T = 298-\n353 K) and ionic strength (I = 0.1-2.67 M) in perchlorate media by Sapieszko et al. \n[18] Using their data, we have calculated that, in order to prevent significant \nformation of hydrolysed iron (III) under the conditions of our experiments (T = 293-\n323 K, and I ~ 0.1M), the value of the pH to be used in the determination of the \nequilibrium constants of formation of the acetohydroxamatoiron (III) complexes \n 6\nAcetohydroxamatoiron (III) complexes  Andrieux et al. \nshould not exceed 1 at T > 300 K. Any data presented at pH > 1 at T > 300 K is \nshown for the purposes of context only. \n2.3. Procedures \nUV-visible absorbance spectra of complex and complex precursor solutions were \nmeasured by spectrophotometry (Diode Array model 8452A, Hewlett Packard, USA) \nfitted with a HP89090A Peltier temperature controller. Solutions for spectroscopic \nmeasurement were prepared from stock (Fe(III)) or freshly made solutions (AHA, \nprepared immediately prior to experiment) and pipetted into an optical cuvette \n(pathlength 1 cm). The complexant (AHA) was added last. The volume of complexant \nrequired was always small and had no effect on the temperature of the receiving \nsolution when added. The spectra were then measured as soon as possible after \nmixing. All experiments were performed at pH ( = \u2013 log10[H+]) < 1 in order to \nminimise hydrolysis of free ferric ions and the formation of iron hydroxides and \noxyhydroxides. \n \n3. Results and Discussions \nPrior to reporting our EAS measurements, we shall first describe briefly our simple \napproach for the extraction of equilibrium constants from those spectra. \nIn a solution containing any amounts of iron and acetohydroxamic acid, the \nconcentrations of the various species in solution obtained as a result of the \nestablishment of equilibria described in eqs. 1-3 may be expressed as follows: \n3 3\n1 2[ ] [ ]iFe Fe 3\u03be \u03be \u03be+ += \u2212 \u2212 \u2212  (5) \n 7\nAcetohydroxamatoiron (III) complexes  Andrieux et al. \n1 2 3[ ] [ ] 2 3iHL HL \u03be \u03be \u03be= \u2212 \u2212 \u2212  (6) \n2\n1[ ]FeL  \u03be+ =  (7) \n2[ ]FeL 2  \u03be+ =  (8) \n3[ ]FeL 3\u03be=  (9) \n1 2[ ] [ ] 2 3iH H 3\u03be \u03be \u03be+ += + + +  (10) \nwhere [Fe3+]i, [HL]i and [H+]i represent the initial concentrations of iron(III), \nacetohydroxamic acid and nitric acid, respectively. \n3.1. Determination of K1 and the molar absorptivity of FeL2+ \nEq. 11 shows K1 expressed in terms of the parameters defined in eqs. 5-10 under \nconditions where \u03be2 \u2248 0 and \u03be3 \u2248 0 i.e. in the effective absence of the 2:1 or higher \nFe(III)-AHA complexes \n \n( )\n( ) ( )\n1 i 1\n1 3\ni 1 i 1\n[H ]\nK\n[Fe ] [HL]\n+\n+\n\u03be \u00d7 + \u03be= \u2212 \u03be \u00d7 \u2212 \u03be  (11) \nAt any given temperature, eq. 11 contains two unknown parameters: K1 which is \nconstant and \u03be1, dependent on the concentrations of the other components of the \nsystem. Thus, eq. 11 may only be solved if two datasets are recorded under different \nexperimental conditions (e.g. at different pH). The ratio of the absorbances, Abs, for \nthese two experiments being equivalent to the ratio of the mono-complex \nconcentrations, provided the absorbance of the complex is measured at a wavelength \nthat is non-coincident with the absorbance envelope of all other components in \nsolution (H+, HL, Fe3+). Preliminary spectral measurements (not shown) indicate that \nthis condition is satisfied in the wavelength range 800 to 350 nm. Accordingly, \n 8\nAcetohydroxamatoiron (III) complexes  Andrieux et al. \nabsorbances were measured at \u03bb = 510 nm and eq. 11 may be rewritten for the two \narbitrarily numbered experiments as a function of only one unknown parameter (\u03be1): \n \n( )\n( )( )\n( )\n( )( )\n1,1 ,1 1,1 1,1 ,2 1,1\n1 3 3\n,1 1 ,1 1,1 ,2 1,1 ,2 1,1\n[ ] [ ]\n[ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]\n+ +\n+ +\n+ += =\u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212\n\u03be \u03be \u03be \u03be\n\u03be \u03be \u03be\ni i\ni i i i\nH x H\nK\nFe HL Fe x HL x\u03be\nx\n (12) \nwith   \n2\n1,22 2\n2\n1,1 1\n1\nFeL Absx\nAbsFeL\n\u03be\n\u03be\n+\n+\n\u23a1 \u23a4\u23a3 \u23a6= = =\u23a1 \u23a4\u23a3 \u23a6\n \nwhere the additional subscript refers to the arbitrarily attributed experiment number. \nEq. 12 may be rearranged into the quadratic eq. 13 which is soluble provided that both \nexperiments are recorded with known total concentrations of H+, HL and Fe3+. The \nresulting roots can then be inspected and the one corresponding to a positive value of \nthe complex concentration lower than the total amount of acetohydroxamic acid, \nselected as \u03be1,1. \n( ) ( )( )\n( ( )\n( ) )\n2 3 3\n,1 ,1 ,1 ,2 ,2 ,2 1,1\n2 3 3\n,1 ,1 ,2 ,1 ,1\n3 3\n,1 ,2 ,2 ,2 ,2 1,1\n3 3\n,1 ,2 ,2 ,2 ,1\n[ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]\n[ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]\n[ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]\n[ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [\ni i i i i i\ni i i i i\ni i i i i\ni i i i i\nx HL Fe H x HL Fe H\nx Fe HL x H HL Fe\nH HL Fe Fe HL\nH Fe HL x H Fe HL\n\u03be\n\u03be\n+ + + +\n+ + +\n+ + +\n+ + + +\n+ + \u2212 + +\n\u23a1\u2212 + + \u2212\u23a3\n\u23a4+ + +\u23a6\n\u2212( ),1] 0i =\n2 +\n (13) \nAs implied above, for K1 to be determined from this treatment, the spectrum of the \nmono-complex must be measured in the absence of bis- or tris- complexes in solution. \nPreliminary speciation calculations [11] suggest that this may be achieved by \nrecording the spectra in a large excess of iron (III). Thus, three solutions were \nprepared containing 50 mol\u2022m-3 Fe3+ and 1 mol\u2022m-3 AHA at pH = 0.2, 0.71 and 0.85, \n 9\nAcetohydroxamatoiron (III) complexes  Andrieux et al. \nrespectively. Fig.1 shows a typical spectrum recorded from the solution at pH = 0.2 at \nT = 313K. Values of \u03be1,1 were then calculated for each of the three pairs of solution, \nand an average K1 determined. This procedure was repeated at 293, 298, 303, 313, \nand 323 K to obtain the equilibrium constant as a function of temperature. Values of \nK1 as a function of temperature are given in table 1. \nIf it is assumed that \u0394Ho and \u0394So are invariant with temperature, the Van\u2019t Hoff \nisochore may be written as: \n  1ln\no oH SK\nRT R\n\u0394 \u0394= \u2212 +  (14) \nIn accordance with eq. 14, Fig. 2 shows a plot of ln K1 vs. T-1 for the data of table 1. \nThe linearity of this plot justifies our assumption of T-invariant \u0394Ho and \u0394So in the \nderivation of eq. 14, use of which allows calculation of their values as \u201356.4 kJ\u2022mol-1 \nand \u2013158.2 J\u2022mol-1\u2022K-1, respectively. These values indicate that the formation of the \nmono- complex is accompanied by a loss of entropy and so is enthalpically driven. \nUsing the spectra obtained above, together with the concentrations of the mono- \ncomplex calculated in the computation of K1, it is possible to obtain the value of the \nmolar absorptivity (\u03b5 in m2\u2022mol-1) for this complex, via Beer\u2019s law: \n1Abs l= \u03b5 \u03be  (15) \nwhere l is the width of the cuvette in m, and \u03be1 is expressed in mol\u2022m-3. The molar \nabsorptivity for the monoacetohydroxamatoiron (III) complex was found to be \u03b51 = \n101 \u00b1 1 m2\u2022mol-1. \n3.2.  Determination of K2 and the molar absorptivity of FeL2+ \n 10\nAcetohydroxamatoiron (III) complexes  Andrieux et al. \nDetermination of K2 necessitates study of solutions wherein the mono- and bis- \ncomplexes dominate and the tris- complex is absent. Farkas et al. [19] suggest that the \ntransition of the dominant species from mono- to bis- to tris- as ligand concentration \nis increased can be followed by the absorption maximum moving from 510 to 470 to \n420 nm for the mono-, bis- and tris- complexes, respectively. Consequently solution \nconditions that give rise to \u03bbmax between 510 and 470 nm might be expected to give \nrise to a system wherein the concentration of the tris- complex can be considered to be \napproximately zero, especially if \u03bbmax is closer to 510 than 470 nm. In the pH range \n0.2 \u2013 0.9, this condition was found to be satisfied experimentally for [Fe3+] and [HL] \nvalues of 0.5 mol\u2022m-3 and 200 mol\u2022m-3, respectively. The assumption that the \nconcentration of the tris- complex can be neglected at these [Fe3+] and [HL] values \nover this pH range is supported by preliminary results in our previous paper [11]. \nIn order to determine values of K2 from solutions containing a mixture of the mono- \nand bis-acetohydroxamato complexes, the contributions of each species to the \nobserved spectra must first be deconvoluted. Spectra of the mono-complex alone were \nobtained in the determination of K1. These may be normalised at \u03bbmax = 510 nm and \naveraged over the wavelength range considered here (350-800 nm) and used to \npartition the signal obtained from a mixture of both complexes according to its source \n(mono- or bis- complex). In this process the normalised peak obtained for the mono-\ncomplex is multiplied by a scaling factor and subtracted from the real solution spectra, \nrevealing the spectra of the bis- complex. Increasing the value of the scaling factor \ndisplaces the peak calculated for the bis- complex toward lower wavelengths. The fit \nis complete when the \u03bbmax of the absorbance attributed to the bis-complex spectrum \nreaches \u03bbmax reported for this complex in the literature (\u03bbmax = 470 nm) [2]. This \nprocedure is repeated for each pH (0.4, 0.6 and 0.74) at all temperatures studied (T = \n 11\nAcetohydroxamatoiron (III) complexes  Andrieux et al. \n293-323 K). All three spectra obtained at pH 0.61 and T = 323 K \u2013 separate mono-, \nseparate bis- and mono- and bis- together \u2013 are overlaid in Fig.3. \nFrom this series of deconvoluted spectra, it is possible to determine the concentration \nof the mono-complex (from the molar absorptivity calculated in section 3.1 and the \ndeconvoluted absorbance at 510nm) and the absorbance at \u03bbmax = 470 nm due to the \npresence of the bis- complex. Using an argument similar to that advanced to \ndetermine K1, it is then possible to calculate the concentration of the bis- complex and \nthe value of K2. \nStepwise or overall equilibrium constants may be reported for the formation of the \nFe(III)-AHA complexes. Although the mathematical treatment associated with the \ncalculation of the concentration of the bis- complex with the former may be simpler, \nthe latter explicitly takes the formation of the mono- complex into account. We \ntherefore devise a solution using the overall equilibrium constant for FeL2+ formation, \n\u03b22, assuming the simultaneous formation of the mono- and bis- complexes. \u03b22 ( = K1 \nK2) is given by: \n2\n2\n2 3\n[ ][\n[ ][ ]\nFeL H\nFe HL\n\u03b2\n+ +\n+= 2\n]  (16) \nwhich, assuming that \u03be3 \u2248 0, may be expressed as a function of the equilibrium \nconcentrations given in eqs. 5-10, as: \n( )\n( )( )\n2\n2 1 2\n2 23\n1 2 1 2\n[ ] 2\n[ ] [ ] 2\ni\ni i\nH\nFe HL\n\u03be \u03be \u03be\u03b2 \u03be \u03be \u03be \u03be\n+\n+\n+ +=\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212\n (17) \n 12\nAcetohydroxamatoiron (III) complexes  Andrieux et al. \nEq. 17 contains two unknowns \u03b22 and \u03be2; thus, two data sets are again required for \ntheir evaluation. It is possible to calculate the value of \u03be2, by measuring the \nabsorbance of two samples at different pH values but the same temperature at \u03bbmax = \n470 nm and dividing one absorbance value by the other. This results in a soluble \nsystem of two equations with two unknowns given in eq. 18: \n( )\n( )( )\n( )\n( )( )\n2\n2,1 ,1 1,1 2,1\n2 23\n,1 1,1 2,1 ,1 1,1 2,1\n2\n2,1 ,2 1,2 2,1\n23\n,2 1,2 2,1 ,2 1,2 2,1\n[ ] 2\n[ ] [ ] 2\n[ ] 2\n[ ] [ ] 2\ni\ni i\ni\ni i\nH\nFe HL\ny H y\nFe y HL y\n\u03be \u03be \u03be\u03b2\n\u03be \u03be \u03be \u03be\n\u03be \u03be \u03be\n\u03be \u03be \u03be \u03be\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+ +=\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212\n+ +=\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212\n (18) \nwith 2,22 2 2\n2,1 12 1\n[ ]\n[ ]\nFeL Absy\nAbsFeL\n\u03be\n\u03be\n+\n+= = =   \nwhere the additional subscripts again refer to the arbitrarily attributed experiment \nnumber. Rearranging eq. 18 yields eq. 19; this is 6th order with regards to the \nunknown \u03be2,1 and may not be trivially solved analytically but may be solved by a \nstraightforward computation.  \n( ) ( )( )\n( ) ( )( )\n2 23\n2,1 ,1 1,1 2,1 ,2 1,2 2,1 ,2 1,2 2,1\n2 23\n2,1 ,2 1,2 2,1 ,1 1,1 2,1 ,1 1,1 2,1\n[ ] 2 [ ] [ ] 2\n[ ] 2 [ ] [ ] 2\ni i i\ni i i\nH Fe y HL y\ny H x Fe HL\n\u03be \u03be \u03be \u03be \u03be \u03be \u03be\n\u03be \u03be \u03be \u03be \u03be \u03be \u03be\n+ +\n+ +\n+ + \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212\n\u2212 + + \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 0=\n (19) \nA spreadsheet is generated calculating the values of the left hand side of eq. 19 as a \nfunction of \u03be2,1. The values of \u03be1 are calculated using the absorbance measured from \nthe deconvoluted spectra and the molar absorptivity measured in section 3.1. The \nroots of eq. 19 are then inspected and the single root that corresponds to a physically \n 13\nAcetohydroxamatoiron (III) complexes  Andrieux et al. \nand mathematically possible bis- complex concentration (i.e. 0 < \u03be2,1 \u2264 [Fe3+]i) is \nselected.  \nSubstitution of this value of \u03be2,1 into eq. 2 then enables the calculation of K2. With \nthree datasets available for each temperature considered, three values of K2 may be \ncalculated and an average taken. Table 2 presents the calculated values of K2 for each \ntemperature. The value of 2.56 calculated at 298K is in fair agreement with the \nliterature value of 2.04 provided by Arif-Kazmi et al. [20]. \nFig.4 shows the K2 data of table 2 plotted in accordance with the K2 analogue of eq. \n14 and in analogy to Fig.2 and again assuming that the standard enthalpy and entropy \nof reaction for the formation of the bis-complex are invariant with temperature over \nthe range studied. The linearity of the plot of Fig.4 supports this assumption and, in \nconjunction with eq. 14, allows for the determination of values of \u0394Ho and \u0394So for the \nformation of the bis- complex of \u201317.09 kJ\u2022mol-1 and \u201349.7 J\u2022mol-1\u2022K-1, respectively. \nAs for the mono- complex, both \u0394Ho and \u0394So for the formation of the bis- complex \nare negative, indicating that the process is accompanied by a loss of entropy and so is \nenthalpically driven. \nUsing the deconvoluted spectra obtained earlier in this section, together with the \nconcentrations of the bis- complex calculated in the computation of K2, it is possible \nto obtain the value of the molar absorptivity for this complex, via Beer\u2019s law (eq. 15), \nwhich is found to be \u03b52 = 165 \u00b1 14 m2\u2022mol-1. \n3.3. Determination of K3. and the molar molar absorptivity of FeL3 \nUsing analoguous arguments as those advanced in section 3.2 for the determination of \nK2 it is possible to identify preliminary solution conditions under which only the bis- \n 14\nAcetohydroxamatoiron (III) complexes  Andrieux et al. \nand tris- complexes are present. Again, preliminary calculations [11] indicate that, in \nthe pH range 0.2\u20130.9, this condition is satisfied for [Fe3+]i and [HL]i values of 0.4 \nmol\u2022m-3 and 6300 mol\u2022m-3, respectively.  \nThe signals from each compound in each solution studied were deconvoluted by \nfollowing the methodology described in section 3.2 i.e. by subtracting the normalised \naveraged spectra of the bis- complex from the real solution spectrum in order to \nisolate that of the tris- complex. Again, the literature value of the wavelength of \nmaximum absorption for the tris- complex (\u03bbmax = 420 nm) [7] was used to determine \nthe value of the scaling factor.  \nEvaluation of the overall equilibrium constant for the formation of the tris-complex \u03b23 \nis again preferred over the stepwise equilibrium constant K3 as it explicitly takes the \npresence of mono- and bis- complexes into account. \u03b23 ( = K3 K2 K1) is given by: \n3\n3\n3 3\n[ ][ ]\n[ ][ ]\nFeL H\n3Fe HL\n\u03b2\n+\n+=  (20) \nwhich may be expressed as a function of the equilibrium concentrations given in eqs. \n5-10, assuming that the entirety of iron is complexed to form the bis- and tris- \ncomplexes and that no mono- complex is present (\u03be1 \u2248 0). This gives: \n( )\n( )( )\n3\n3 2 3\n3 33\n2 3 2 3\n[ ] 2 3\n[ ] [ ] 2 3\ni\ni i\nH\nFe HL\n\u03be \u03be \u03be\u03b2 \u03be \u03be \u03be \u03be\n+\n+\n+ +=\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212\n (21) \nEq. 21 contains two unknowns, \u03b23 and \u03be3. Thus, as in the analysis of eqs. 11 and 17, \ntwo data sets are required. Measurement of the absorbance of the tris- complex at \u03bbmax \n= 420 nm at two different pH values, allows us to write: \n 15\nAcetohydroxamatoiron (III) complexes  Andrieux et al. \n( )\n( )( )\n( )\n( )( )\n3\n3,1 ,1 2,1 3,1\n3 33\n,1 2,1 3,1 ,1 2,1 3,1\n3\n3,1 ,2 2,2 3,1\n33\n,2 2,2 3,1 ,2 2,2 3,1\n[ ] 2 3\n[ ] [ ] 2 3\n[ ] 2 3\n[ ] [ ] 2 3\ni\ni i\ni\ni i\nH\nFe HL\nz H z\nFe z HL z\n\u03be \u03be \u03be\u03b2\n\u03be \u03be \u03be \u03be\n\u03be \u03be \u03be\n\u03be \u03be \u03be \u03be\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+ +=\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212\n+ +=\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212\n (22) \nwith 3,23 2 2\n3 1 3,1 1\n[ ]\n[ ]\nFeL Absz\nFeL Abs\n\u03be\n\u03be= = =   \nwhere the additional subscripts are again the arbitrarily assigned experiment number. \nRearranging eq. 22 yields eq. 23 which is 8th order with regards to the unknown \u03be3,1 \nand may again be solved by computation, in analogy to eq. 19. \n( ) ( )( )\n( ) ( )( )\n3 33\n3,1 ,2 2,2 3,1 ,1 2,1 3,1 ,1 2,1 3,1\n3 33\n3,1 ,1 2,1 3,1 ,2 2,2 3,1 ,2 2,2 3,1\n[ ] 2 3 [ ] [ ] 2 3\n[ ] 2 3 [ ] [ ] 2 3 0\ni i i\ni i i\nz H z Fe HL\nH Fe z HL\n\u03be \u03be \u03be \u03be \u03be \u03be \u03be\n\u03be \u03be \u03be \u03be \u03be \u03be \u03be\n+ +\n+ +\n+ + \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212\n\u2212 + + \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 z =\n  (23) \nThe roots are then inspected and the single root that corresponds to a physically and \nmathematically possible value of the tris- complex concentration (i.e. 0 < \u03be3,1 \u2264 \n[Fe3+]i) is selected. Substitution into eq. 3 then allows calculation of K3. Table 3 \npresents the values of K3 calculated from the three datasets available for each \ntemperature. The value measured at 298K (17.9x10-3) is of the same order as the \nliterature value of 7.4 x 10-3 provided by Arif-Kazmi et al. [20]. \nFig.6 shows the data of table 3 plotted in an analogous fashion as the data of tables 1 \nand 2 are plotted in Figs.2 and 4, again assuming that \u0394Ho and \u0394So for the formation \nof the tris- complex are invariant with temperature over the range studied. Again, the \nlinearity of the plot in Fig.6 supports this assumption. From Fig.6, and the K3 \nanalogue of eq. 14, \u0394Ho and \u0394So are found to be +19.74 kJ\u2022mol-1 and +32.93 J\u2022mol-\n1\u2022K-1 respectively. In contrast to the formation of the mono- and bis- complexes, \u0394So \n 16\nAcetohydroxamatoiron (III) complexes  Andrieux et al. \nand \u0394Ho for the formation of the tris- complex are both positive, indicating that the \nprocess is entropically driven. \nUsing the deconvoluted spectra obtained earlier in this section, together with the \nconcentrations of the tris- complex calculated in the computation of K3, it is possible \nto obtain the value of the molar absorptivity for this complex, via Beer\u2019s law, eq. 15, \nwhich is found to be \u03b53 = 363 \u00b1 29 m2\u2022mol-1. \n3.4. Speciation of the Fe-AHA complexes \nWith values of K1, K2 and K3 as a function of temperature now computed, it is \npossible to generate speciation diagrams for the Fe(III)-AHA system taking into \naccount pH, pHL ( = \u2013log10[HL]) and temperature.  \nFig.7 shows the speciation diagram calculated as a function of acetohydroxamic acid \nconcentration (given as pHL) for a range of nitric acid concentrations at a temperature \nof 293 K. For a given pHL value, an increase in pH results in an increase in the order \nof the complex formed from free metal ion to mono-, bis- and tris- complex.  \nFig.8 shows the speciation diagram calculated as a function of pH for a range of \nacetohydroxamic acid concentrations at a temperature of 293 K. As expected from \neqs. 1-3, an increase in the concentration of AHA (decrease in pHL) results in the \nformation of higher order acetohydroxamatoiron(III) complexes. \nFig.9 shows the speciation diagram calculated as a function of pHL for a nitric acid \nconcentration of 100 mol\u2022m-3 at a range of temperatures. Fig.10 shows the speciation \ndiagrams calculated as a function of pH for a total acetohydroxamic acid \nconcentration of 250 mol\u2022m-3, again at a range of temperatures.  \n 17\nAcetohydroxamatoiron (III) complexes  Andrieux et al. \nFrom both Figs.9 and 10 it can be seen that increasing temperature is detrimental to \nthe formation of the mono- and bis- complexes, which is to be expected from the \nexothermic character of these reactions. However the formation of the unbound metal \n(especially at low pH) and the tris- complex (especially at high pH) are favoured by \nrising T, due to the displacement of the equilibria forming the bis- and mono- \ncomplexes as well as the endothermic character of the reaction described by eq. 3. \n3.5. Verification of the assumptions made in the determination of K1, K2 and K3. \nThe calculations of K1, K2, and K3 functions of temperature were each conducted \nunder conditions where it was assumed that one or more of the \nacetohydroxamatoiron(III) complexes were present in negligible amounts only. These \nassumptions may now be verified by building speciation diagrams for the pH range \nand specific concentrations of AHA and Fe(III) used in the each of these experiments.  \nFig.11 shows the speciation diagrams calculated for the conditions under which K1 \nwas determined ([Fe3+] = 50 mol\u2022m-3, [AHA] = 1 mol\u2022m-3) at 293 and 323 K. Over \nthe pH range considered for this study (pH = 0.2 \u2013 0.85), a maximum of 0.30% of all \ncomplexed iron is present as either the bis- or the tris- complex, which supports the \nassumption made in section 3.1 that the mono- complex and free iron are the \npredominant species in solution. \nFig.12 shows the speciation diagrams calculated for the conditions under which K2 \nwas determined ([Fe3+] = 0.5 mol\u2022m-3, [AHA] = 200 mol\u2022m-3) at 293 and 323K. Over \nthe pH range studied (pH = 0.4 \u2013 0.74), a maximum of 2.67% of all complexed Fe(III) \nis present as the trisacetohydroxamatoiron species, the remainder being present as \neither the mono- or bis- complex, thus validating our assumption in section 3.2 that \n 18\nAcetohydroxamatoiron (III) complexes  Andrieux et al. \nthe mono- and bis- complexes are the predominant acetohydroxamatoiron species in \nsolution. \nFig.13 shows the speciation diagrams calculated for the conditions under which K3 \nwas determined ([Fe3+] = 0.4 mol\u2022m-3, [AHA] = 6300 mol\u2022m-3) at 293 and 323K. \nOver the range of pH considered for this study (pH = 0.4 \u2013 0.93), a maximum of \n2.69% of the complexed iron is available as the mono- complex, the rest being present \nas either the bis- or tris- complex. Again, this supports our assumption in section 3.3 \nthat the mono- complex is present in negligible amounts compared to the higher \ncomplexes, so allowing us to ignore it in determination of K3.  \nThe above determined limits on the assumptions underpinning the spectral \ndeconvolution technique, as well as the molar absorptivities for each complex \n(summarised in table 4) now allow us to advance an explanation for the comparatively \nlarge standard deviation values observed with respect to the value of K2.  \nThese may arise from the combined effect of the relatively low concentrations of the \nvarious interferents and their respective molar absorptivities. For example, the \ninterferent in the case of the determination of K2 is the tris- complex, which has a \nmolar absorptivity value 2.2x higher than that of the bis- complex and 3.6x that of the \nmono-complex, amplifying its influence on the measured absorbance. Conversely, the \ndetermination of K3 neglects the presence of the mono-complex (actually present in \nlevels similar to the levels of the tris- complex in the determination of K2), which has \na molar absorbtivity 0.6x that of the bis- complex and 0.28x that of the tris- complex. \nAs an impurity, it therefore has a proportionately smaller effect on the absorbance-\nderived determination of K3 than the tris- complex has on the determination of K2, and \nresults in a narrower distribution of K3 values. It should also be noted that the levels \n 19\nAcetohydroxamatoiron (III) complexes  Andrieux et al. \nof the bis- and tris- complex in the determination of K1 are very low (0.3% overall) \nand thus do not contribute significantly to elevating the standard deviation in the value \nof K1 in spite of their greater molar absorptivities. \n \n4. Conclusions \nThe thermodynamic constants for all three equilibria that obtain in the iron(III)-AHA \nsystem have been calculated and the associated enthalpies and entropies for the \nformation of these complexes have been determined. These are summarised in table 4 \ntogether with the molar absorptivity for each of the three complexes. These new \nvalues have been used to calculate speciation diagrams for the Fe-AHA system as a \nfunction of pH, AHA concentration and temperature. \nInspection of the molar absorptivities measured for all three complexes reveal that it \nincreases as the number of ligands bound to the iron increase. This is presumably in \nline with the greater availability of ligands to contribute to the ligand-to-metal charge \ntransfer bands that dominate the absorption spectra of the Fe(III)-AHA system.. \nIt is of note that as the number of bound ligands increase, the enthalpy and entropy \nboth become progressively more positive, i.e. complexation becomes enthalpically \nless favourable but entropically more favourable as the L:M ratio increases. \nAs regards the entropy changes, this probably reflects the entropy being a balance of \ntwo effects as individual reactions progress:  \n(i)  The entropy increases as a result of the chelate effect, which is probably \nstrong due to the generation of a 5-membered ring as the two solution phase \n 20\nAcetohydroxamatoiron (III) complexes  Andrieux et al. \nreagents come together, releasing two water molecules from the inner \nsolvation shell of Fe(III) and a proton from the AHA. Also, the outer sphere \nordering of the solvent around the complex decreases as more ligands are \nadded and the overall electrostatic charge on the complex decreases. \n(ii) The entropy decreases as a result of a low charge density positive charge on \nthe iron complex being partially converted to high charge density positive \ncharge on the proton, with concomitant ordering of solvent around the proton. \nIn the formation of the mono- complex, process (ii) is presumably dominant but \nbecomes less so as the ligand number increases due to the decrease in charge of the \nformed complex and so decrease in its influence on the ordering of the solvent. Thus \nas the influence of (ii) decreases, the impact of (i) becomes proportionately greater \nuntil it dominates and the complexation process exhibits an overall favourable \nformation entropy with the neutral Fe(AHA)3 complex. \nThe progression in enthalpy suggests that, as the degree of complexation increases, \nthe energy balance between Fe-O bonds breaking (Ebb) and bonds forming (Ebf) \nchanges from \u23d0Ebb\u23d0 < \u23d0Ebf\u23d0 in the Fe(AHA)2+ to \u23d0Ebb\u23d0 > \u23d0Ebf\u23d0 in the Fe(AHA)3 \ncomplex, i.e. the replacement of two H2O molecules by an AHA ligand becomes less \nfavourable. This is presumably related to steric considerations as the hydroxamate \nligand is much bulkier than the two water molecules it displaces. Thus, as the number \nof hydroxamato ligands around the metal increases, the resultant ligand-ligand \nrepulsion forces increase, acting against the enthalpy gained by complexation. \nFinally, we have recently developed a speciation dependent kinetic model [11] that \nallows for the determination of the rate parameter for the hydrolysis of the ligand \n 21\nAcetohydroxamatoiron (III) complexes  Andrieux et al. \nwithin the mono- complex. The speciation diagrams presented in this communication \nwill allow for the desired temperature dependent study of this rate parameter. It will \nalso allow for the extraction of the activiation energy and Arrhenius pre-exponential \nfactor for the process, so providing valuable mechanistic information. This will be the \nsubject of our next paper. \n \nAcknowledgments \nThe authors thank the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) for financial \nsupport and for a post-doctoral research fellowship for FA. \n 22\nAcetohydroxamatoiron (III) complexes  Andrieux et al. \nReferences \n[1] Muri, E.M.F., Nieto, M.J., Sindelar, R.D., Williamson, J.S.: Hydroxamic \nAcids as Pharmacological Agents.
