Using five independent analytic and Monte Carlo simulation codes, we have studied the\nperformance of wide-field ground-layer adaptive optics (GLAO), which can use a single, relatively low order\ndeformable mirror to correct the wave-front errors from the lowest altitude turbulence. GLAO concentrates more\nlight from a point source in a smaller area on the science detector, but unlike with traditional adaptive optics,\nimages do not become diffraction-limited. Rather, the GLAO point-spread function (PSF) has the same functional\nform as a seeing-limited PSF and can be characterized by familiar performance metrics such as full width at\nhalf-maximum (FWHM). The FWHM of a GLAO PSF is reduced by 0\u0001.1 or more for optical and near-infrared\nwavelengths over different atmospheric conditions. For the Cerro Pacho\u00b4n atmospheric model, this correction is\neven greater when the image quality is poorest, which effectively eliminates \u201cbad seeing\u201d nights; the best seeing-\nlimited image quality, available only 20% of the time, can be achieved 60%\u201380% of the time with GLAO. This\nconcentration of energy in the PSF will reduce required exposure times and improve the efficiency of an\nobservatory up to 30%\u201340%. These performance gains are relatively insensitive to a number of trade-offs,\nincluding the exact field of view of a wide-field GLAO system, the conjugate altitude and actuator density of\nthe deformable mirror, and the number and configuration of the guide stars.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nThe idea that the turbulence of the atmosphere can be cor-\nrected by adaptive optics (AO) is not new (Babcock 1953), but\nthere have always been limitations to the approach. One of the\nmore serious is that classical or single guide star AO systems\nproduce only a small corrected field of view (FOV); isoplanatic\nerrors cause the image quality to quickly degrade from the\ncenter of the corrected field. Typically, the spatial resolution\nfalls below the diffraction limit in the near-infrared only 30\u0001\nfrom the guide star. This small and nonuniform corrected FOV\nseverely limits the sky coverage of traditional AO systems, and\neven limits sky coverage for those that employ laser guide stars\n(LGSs; first proposed by Foy & Labeyrie 1985). Another lim-\nitation of traditional AO systems is that the performance de-\ncreases from the near-infrared to the visible; to fully correct\nthe turbulence in the optical would require deformable mirrors\n(DMs) with many more actuators and a control system oper-\n1 Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics, National Research Council of\nCanada, 5071 West Saanich Road, Victoria, BC V9E 2E7, Canada;\ndavid.andersen@cnrc-nrc.gc.ca.\n2 Department of Physics, University of Durham, Rochester Building, Science\nLaboratories, South Road, Durham DH1 3LE, UK.\n3 Steward Observatory, University of Arizona, 933 North Cherry Avenue,\nTucson, AZ 85721.\n4 Thirty Meter Telescope Project, 1200 East California Boulevard, Mail Code\n102-8, Pasadena, California 91125.\n5 Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, Casilla 603, La Serena, Chile.\nating at a much higher frequency (Dekany et al. 2006). Finally,\nexisting AO systems perform well only when the image quality\nconditions are good; if the seeing is poor, control bandwidths\nand DM actuator strokes and densities are insufficient to main-\ntain diffraction-limited imaging.\nIn the near future, multiconjugate adaptive optics (MCAO)\nsystems (Johnston & Welsh 1991; Ragazzoni 1999; Beckers\n2000; Ragazzoni et al. 2000; Flicker et al. 2000) promise to\nproduce a larger corrected FOV with improved sky coverage,\nby employing multiple DMs and wave-front sensors (WFSs),\nbut will still be limited to observations in the near-infrared on\nnights with average or better image quality. While the avail-\nability of MCAO systems will change the use of observatories,\nit is important to realize that today a large fraction of ground-\nbased astronomical research still relies on seeing-limited ob-\nservations at optical wavelengths. Ground-layer adaptive optics\n(GLAO) was proposed to circumvent these limitations of tra-\nditional AO systems by applying a limited AO correction to\nan even larger FOV under any atmospheric conditions, even\nat optical wavelengths (Rigaut 2002). A GLAO system does\nnot attempt to produce diffraction-limited images; instead, it\nattempts to improve the concentration of the point-spread func-\ntion (PSF) by sensing and correcting only the lowest turbulent\nlayers of the atmospheres. Because the corrected layers are so\nclose to the ground, the correction is the same over the entire\nlarge FOV. Uncorrected turbulent layers at higher altitudes de-\ngrade the spatial resolution isoplanatically.

MCAO or classical AO can then be used for follow-\nup observations of individual discoveries made from GLAO\nsurveys.\nEarly simulations suggested that GLAO could produce im-\nages with a full width at half-maximum (FWHM) less than 0\u0001.2\nin the J band. Caution should be used when evaluating early\nGLAO modeling results, however, because they are critically\ndependent on the input turbulence profiles. As Tokovinin\n(2004) pointed out, studies of GLAO require accurate knowl-\nedge of the atmosphere below \u223c2 km, in addition to knowing\nthe turbulence profile of the free atmosphere. Specifically, tur-\nbulent layers at intermediate altitudes, which Tokovinin called\nthe gray zone, will only be partially corrected and will also\nintroduce residual anisoplanatism. Earlier work on GLAO fo-\ncused on FOVs less than 3\u0002 (Baranec et al. 2003; Tokovinin\n2004; LeLouarn & Hubin 2004; Hubin et al. 2004; Jolissaint\net al. 2004; Stoesz et al. 2004).\nHere we examine the performance of a GLAO system over\nFOVs greater than 5\u0002 in size, using new, higher resolution\nturbulence profiles. This work was carried out in order to study\nthe potential of a GLAO system at the Gemini Observatory,\nbut the results are applicable to 10 m class telescopes in general.\nThe results presented here are based on a set of model atmo-\nspheres that were derived at least in part from balloon mea-\nsurements of the turbulence over Cerro Pacho\u00b4n, Chile, that had\na vertical resolution of 6 m (Tokovinin & Travouillon 2006).\nAfter describing these model atmospheres in \u00a7 2, we present\nthe analytic and Monte Carlo modeling tools used for this study\nin \u00a7 3. We also reconcile the results of these codes, which lends\ngreater confidence to the results. Section 4 describes the GLAO\nPSF and relevant performance metrics. We apply these metrics\nin analyzing a baseline wide-field GLAO system in \u00a7 5 and\ndescribe various trade-offs on this baseline in \u00a7 6. Finally,\n\u00a7 7 provides a summary of our modeling results and a dis-\ncussion of the promising future of GLAO.\n2. MODEL ATMOSPHERES\nGLAO system performance depends crucially on the struc-\nture of the atmospheric turbulence profile. In particular, the size\nof the compensated field and the uniformity of the delivered\nPSF over the field depend on the thickness of the boundary\nlayer, while the overall degree of image improvement depends\nsensitively on the ratio of aberrations in the boundary layer to\nthose in the free atmosphere. Historically, these are not quan-\ntities that have been studied in detail because, prior to the\nemergence of GLAO as a potentially valuable observing tool,\nthey were not seen as important measures of a site\u2019s quality.\nFortunately for our study, detailed measurements of the struc-\nture of atmospheric turbulence with a resolution of 6 m in the\nboundary layer (altitudes below 5000 m) recorded from 43\nballoon flights exist as part of the 1998 Gemini South (Gemini-\nS) seeing campaign at Cerro Pacho\u00b4n (Vernin et al. 2000). The\natmospheric turbulence profiles used in this study have been\nderived from those balloon data and also from MASS\/DIMM\n(multiaperture scintillation sensor\/differential image motion\nmonitor) data taken from Cerro Pacho\u00b4n in 2003 (Tokovinin &\nTravouillon 2006; see also Tokovinin et al. 2003). While more\nsite testing is required to confirm the presence of strong ground-\nlayer turbulence at other sites, the results of GLAO simulations\nusing the high-resolution atmospheric data from Cerro Pacho\u00b4n\nshould be generally applicable to other telescope sites.\nIn order to reduce the magnitude of the modeling task, a\ntotal of nine atmospheric profiles have been constructed from\nthe balloon flight data, representing a broad range of typical\nconditions. Three turbulence profiles for the atmosphere below\n2 km in altitude were computed, representing the averages of\nthe best 25%, worst 25%, and central 50% of the data, sorted\nby . Similarly, the free atmosphere above 2 km was rep-r0\nresented by a single layer of turbulence, with and height2Cn\ndetermined again from the best (25%), worst (25%), and typ-\nical (50%) conditions for the upper atmosphere. Essentially,\nno degree of correlation between the strengths of the boundary\nlayer and the free atmosphere was found (Tokovinin 2003),\nso nine profiles were constructed by matching the three\nboundary-layer profiles with each of the three upper atmo-\nsphere layers. Table 1 gives the altitudes and integrated tur-\nbulence values ( in m1\/3) for each of these profiles.2Jp C dh\u222b n\nColumn (1) of this table is the effective height of each layer\nabove the site level, as defined by the integral , and2hC dh\/J\u222b n\nthe remaining columns are the integrated turbulence values\nfor each model profile. The lowest layer was assigned a height\nof zero in this study. The approximate probabilities of occur-\nrence, given the percentiles that the profiles were drawn from,\nare given in Table 2.

MODELING TOOLS\nIn assessing the expected performance of GLAO, five sim-\nulation codes written by four groups have been used. These\nwere thoroughly tested and compared to one another to ensure\na high degree of confidence in the results. Three codes imple-\nment analytic calculations, while the remaining two codes are\nfull-wave propagation Monte Carlo simulations. Analytic\ncodes, which calculate an estimate of the long-exposure AO-\ncorrected PSF using the fact that the optical transfer function\nis proportional to the negative exponential of the aperture-\naveraged structure function of the residual phase disturbances\nin the telescope pupil, were generally used to explore large\nparameter spaces and study various performance trade-offs.\nMonte Carlo models are much more computationally intensive\nand were used primarily to study physical effects not incor-\nporated into analytic models and to verify the analytic model\nresults for the baseline configurations.\n3.1. PAOLA Analytic Modeling Tool\nOne of the analytic modeling codes, PAOLA (Performance\nof Adaptive Optics for Large Apertures; Jolissaint & Ve\u00b4ran\n2002; Jolissaint et al. 2006), was developed at NRC-HIA (Na-\ntional Research Council of Canada\u2019s Herzberg Institute of As-\ntrophysics) and is now used by more than a dozen groups\nthroughout the world. It models the effect of the AO correction\nas a spatial-frequency filtering of the turbulent phase power\nspectrum, from which the AO long-exposure PSF in any di-\nrection is easily derived. One can identify five basic limitations\non any classical AO system, and these are taken into account\nin the PAOLA code:\n1. Anisoplanatism.\u2014In GLAO mode, the DM commands\nare assumed to be derived from an average of the multiple\nguide star WFS measurements. The difference between this\naverage command and the actual turbulent phase at a given\npoint in the field is called the anisoplanatic error and is de-\nMODELING OF A WIDE-FIELD GLAO SYSTEM 1577\n2006 PASP, 118:1574\u20131590\nscribed in Stoesz et al. (2004) for the case of multiple natural\nguide star GLAO. It is important to note that this error term\nis by far the most important for GLAO.\n2. Fitting error.\u2014The number of WFS lenslets (and\/or DM\nactuators) defines the number of aberration modes that can be\ncorrected by the system and, in particular, sets the highest spa-\ntial frequency that can be measured and corrected. Uncorrected\nhigh-spatial-frequency aberrations are transmitted to the output\nof the AO system, giving rise to what is called the fitting error,\ndue to the limited ability of the system to adjust (fit) itself to\nthe incident phase. Fitting error is the next most important\nsource of residual aberrations for GLAO.\n3. WFS spatial aliasing.\u2014These same uncorrected high-\nfrequency aberrations are seen by the WFS as low-spatial-\nfrequency errors and are aliased in the low-frequency domain\nof the WFS. Aliasing error is the third important GLAO error\nsource.\n4. WFS noise.\u2014This error is due to the guide star photon\nnoise, WFS detector read noise, and WFS dark current noise.\n5. System servo lag.\u2014To achieve a sufficient signal-to-noise\nratio (S\/N) on the phase measurement, the WFS has to integrate\nover a given exposure time. Determining the exposure time\ninvolves a trade-off between getting enough guide star photons\nand averaging out the high-temporal-phase fluctuations. More-\nover, the reading of the WFS, the phase reconstruction, and the\nDM surface update takes some time (roughly one sampling\nperiod), creating a time lag between phase measurement and\ncorrection. The phase-error term associated with both time av-\neraging and time lag is called the servo-lag error.\nThe AO loop controller is modeled in PAOLA as a simple\nintegrator. Such an analytical approach is very computationally\nefficient and permits PAOLA to model AO performance across\nlarge parameter spaces in a reasonable period of time. However,\nit can only account for the fundamental limits of the AO cor-\nrection, so the performance estimates need to be refined with\nmuch more computationally intensive Monte Carlo simulation\ntools (see \u00a7\u00a7 3.4 and 3.5), taking into account nonlinear and\/\nor second-order effects (correlated effects, sensitivity to vibra-\ntions, cone effect, spot elongation, etc.) once a reduced set of\nsuitable parameters has been found.\n3.2. CIBOLA\nCIBOLA (Covariance\u2014Including Basic Option for Linear\nAnalysis; Ellerbroek 2005) is a second analytical modeling tool\nthat combines and extends features of PAOLA and prior an-\nalytical models for tomographic wave-front reconstruction and\nMCAO (Tokovinin & Viard 2001; Tokovinin 2002). This code\ncan be used to assess the correlated effect of five fundamental\nerror sources (DM fitting error, WFS spatial aliasing, WFS\nmeasurement noise, finite servo bandwidth, and anisoplana-\ntism) for AO systems, incorporating one or more DMs and\nWFSs. Narrow and wide-field performance estimates can be\nobtained in terms of wave-front error power spectra and PSFs,\ncomputed using conventional, MCAO, or GLAO control\nalgorithms.\nThe principal capabilities and limitations of CIBOLA are\nderived from the use of spatial filtering approximations for all\nof the basic wave-front propagation, sensing, reconstruction,\nand correction operators encountered in classical linear systems\nmodeling of adaptive optics. This approach enables rapid anal-\nysis of AO systems, which is sufficiently accurate for many\napplications, but also neglects aperture edge effects and is (rig-\norously) limited to the case of natural guide stars.\n3.3. Arizona Analytic Code\nThe IDL-based analytic GLAO simulation tool used at the\nUniversity of Arizona was originally developed by Tokovinin\n(2004). A multilayer residual structure function for each beacon\nis computed from the von Ka\u00b4rma\u00b4n power spectrum at each\nturbulent layer, accounting for the geometry of the beacon con-\nstellation. The model assumes that a single natural guide star\nis used for sensing global tilt. The effects of temporal delay\nand WFS noise are neglected.\n3.4. Arizona Monte Carlo Simulation Code\nThe Monte Carlo simulation tool written at the University\nof Arizona, described by Lloyd-Hart & Milton (2003), supports\nan arbitrary number of LGSs, natural guide stars (NGSs), DMs,\nand atmospheric turbulence layers. The model assumes the geo-\nmetric optics approximation. Atmospheric turbulence and DM\ncorrections are represented as vectors of coefficients of the\nZernike modes. An analytic computation is used to obtain the\ninfluence of atmospheric turbulence at each layer within the\nintersecting cone for each LGS and NGS. The net aberration\nfor an object at infinity is also computed analytically.\nThe reconstruction matrix is built from the product of the\nmaximum a priori (MAP) inverse of the DM influence ma-\ntrix and the atmospheric-layer influence matrix. Random-\nturbulence Zernike coefficient vectors are generated from the\nCerro Pacho\u00b4n atmospheric models using Kolmogorov statistics\nfor the Zernike polynomials of order (i.e., the first1 \u2264 n \u2264 30\n496 Zernike polynomials). DM corrections are the product of\nthese random-turbulence Zernike coefficient vectors and the\nreconstruction matrix. Read noise with Gaussian statistics and\nPoisson photon noise are simulated for a Hartmann-Shack WFS\nand added to the noise-free wave-front corrections.\nThe performance of each candidate GLAO beacon config-\nuration is evaluated by calculating the rms wave-front deviation\nat a range of different field positions out to the full field radius.\nThe expected uncorrected rms error for Zernike modes of order\nis added to account for high-frequency modes not in-n 1 30\ncluded in the simulation.\n1578 ANDERSEN ET AL.\n2006 PASP, 118:1574\u20131590\nTABLE 4\nParameters of the Common Models Used to Validate the\nSimulation Codes\nParameter Value\nAtmosphere . . . . . . r0 p 17 cm at l p 500 nm; L0 p 30 m\nprofiles (fractional power at each height):2Cn\nHeight (m) 0 300 500 900 2000 10,000\nProfile 1: 0.45 0.15 0.00 0.00 0.07 0.33\nProfile 2: 0.30 0.00 0.30 0.00 0.07 0.33\nProfile 3: 0.20 0.00 0.00 0.40 0.07 0.33\nTelescope . . . . . . . .

Results between 1 and 1.9 use profile 1\nfrom Table 4, results between 2 and 2.9 use profile 2, and results between 3\nand 3.9 use profile 3. The 10 PSF residuals shown for each profile are made\nfrom five field positions with and without the inclusion of noise. Results labeled\nwith numbers greater than or equal to one-half for each profile came from\nsimulations including noise.

Regardless of the\ndetails of the fits, model atmospheres, or inclusion of noise, the five GLAO\nsimulation codes produced FWHMs that agreed to within 0\u0001.04. In most cases,\nthe agreement was even better. The analytic codes produced virtually indis-\ntinguishable results; the Monte Carlo codes, which included a greater range\nof physical effects, produced corrected FWHMs that were not quite as narrow\nin most cases.\n3.5. Durham Monte Carlo AO Model\nThe University of Durham (UD) Monte Carlo AO model\nincludes detailed WFS noise propagation, produces two-\ndimensional PSFs, and was used to quantify the effects of such\nnoise on PSF parameters across the GLAO field for various\nseeing and noise conditions and zenith angles. The capabilities\nof the UD Monte Carlo code are summarized as follows:\n1. The atmospheric model can cope with a large (not spe-\ncifically limited) number of independently moving turbulent\nlayers.\n2. Multiple laser beacons and\/or NGSs can be modeled.\n3. Multiple DMs of a number of types can be modeled.\n4. Multiple WFSs (one per laser beacon or NGS) can be\nincluded. These include all main detector noise effects, as well\nas the effects of detector pixellation and atmospherically in-\nduced speckle.\n5. The science PSF may be sampled at a number of field\npoints.\n3.6. Direct Comparison of Results\nStarting with the same inputs (Table 4), three figures of merit\nwere computed for PSFs compensated with GLAO: FWHM,\nensquared energy within 0\u0001.1, and Strehl ratio. Three turbulence\nprofiles were run both with and without photon and read noise\nincluded. In all models, spatial fitting error was included, and\nsome included WFS aliasing error. Other sources of residual\nwave-front error, such as servo lag, were omitted. The intention\nwas not to produce realistic estimates of performance at Gem-\nini-S , but rather to verify that the codes all predicted essentially\nthe same results (this was not true initially, but excellent agree-\nment was eventually achieved).\nThe results from the five codes are summarized in Figure 2\nand demonstrate agreement to within \u223c0\u0001.02 in the PSF FWHM.\nThe two Monte Carlo codes generally predict somewhat worse\nperformance than the three analytic codes, presumably because\nof the inclusion in the Monte Carlo simulations of a greater\nrange of physical effects.\nMODELING OF A WIDE-FIELD GLAO SYSTEM 1579\n2006 PASP, 118:1574\u20131590\nFig. 3.\u2014Radial profile of GLAO-corrected PSFs in normalized flux vs.\nradius (thick solid line).

The squares are results for seeing-\nlimited PSFs, and the circles show results of GLAO-improved PSFs. The two\nparameters are strongly correlated, which indicates that the shape (i.e., the\nMoffat b parameter) of the PSF does not change significantly in these simu-\nlations. There are two sequences apparent in the GLAO PSFs. The points in\nthe upper sequence were simulated using the \u201cbad\u201d ground-layer turbulence\nprofile. In this case, it appears that the core of the PSF is improved with\nGLAO, but that the PSF halo is slightly stronger, which leads to a comparatively\nlarger half-light radius. The overall tight relation between half-light radius and\nFWHM means that both parameters are valuable GLAO merit functions.4. TOOLS FOR EVALUATING GLAO\nPERFORMANCE\nThe PSF from a GLAO system is very different from the\nPSF of a diffraction-limited AO system. Therefore, the proper\nmerit functions for evaluating a GLAO system need to be iden-\ntified. We begin this process by describing the functional form\nof the GLAO PSF and then present and discuss various per-\nformance metrics we use to gauge the performance of GLAO.\n4.1. The GLAO PSF\nThe PSF produced by a wide-field GLAO system exhibits\nno diffraction-limited peak and qualitatively is very similar to\nthe PSF generated without any form of AO. The shape of the\nGLAO PSF shown in Figure 3 is well fit by the same function\ncommonly used to describe seeing-limited PSFs, the Moffat\nfunction (Moffat 1969):\n2 \u0001br\nI(r)p I 1\u0002 . (1)0 ( )[ ]a\nA Gaussian profile matches the profile shape only to roughly\n50% of the peak flux, while the Moffat function provides a\ngood fit below 1% of the peak height. Based on our simulated\nPSFs, both the GLAO PSF and seeing-limited PSF are well fit\nby a Moffat PSF with b between 2.5 and 4.5.\n4.2. GLAO Merit Functions\nAs part of the Gemini feasibility study, a reasonably detailed\nscience case was prepared for GLAO. Science requirements\nfor GLAO with representative instruments were then defined.\nProper modeling of the science gains from a GLAO system\nrequires the full PSF information. However, for many of the\nscience cases, a few key parameters that gave a reasonable (but\nsimplified) understanding of the gains were identified. We pre-\nsent and discuss several of these merit functions here:\n1. Full width at half-maximum.\u2014A familiar and easily cal-\nculable quantity is the FWHM of the PSF. For proper motion\nstudies or work on crowded stellar fields, at least with the\nexpected GLAO PSF shapes, FWHM is a key parameter.\n2. Half-light radius (v50).\u2014The radius enclosing 50% of the\ntotal energy\u2014the half-light radius\u2014is a particularly valuable\nmerit function if the shape of the PSF is not well understood.\nA correlation exists between and FWHM (Fig. 4), but be-v50\n1580 ANDERSEN ET AL.\n2006 PASP, 118:1574\u20131590\nFig. 5.\u2014EE within 100, 200, and 400 mas, and Strehl ratio vs. wavelength for bad : bad (dotted lines), typical : typical (solid lines), and good : good (dashed\nlines). Thick lines show the GLAO performance, while thin lines show the seeing-limited measurements. The EE within 100 mas is less than 10% at most\nwavelengths and for most turbulence profiles. Only 20% of the EE is within 200 mas in most cases. The Strehl ratio is very low for wide-field GLAO observations\nand is less than 4% in most cases (except for the good : good performance at ).l 1 1.5 mm\ncause of the variation in the Moffat parameter b, the half-light\nradius may be a better general merit function, since it is more\ntightly correlated with the integration time ratio discussed\nbelow.\n3. Ensquared energy (EE).\u2014Measured within an aperture (we\nused 0\u0001.1 and 0\u0001.2 apertures), EE is an important merit function\nfor spectroscopy, as it indicates the amount of energy that enters\na slit of a given size. The EE within 100 or 200 mas is small\nat most scientific wavelengths, however, as shown by Figure 5.\n4. Integration time ratio (ITR).\u2014Defined as the ratio of re-\nquired exposure times to reach a given S\/N in the optimal\naperture in the background-limited case without and with\nGLAO; the higher the value of ITR, the greater the GLAO\nperformance gain. ITR is especially relevant to science cases\nrequiring faint, pointlike object imaging. As expected from the\nS\/N equation, ITR is proportional to the square of the ratio of\nseeing-limited to GLAO (Fig. 6).v50\n5. Image quality variation.\u2014An important scientific criterion\nto consider is the image quality variation over the scientific\nFOV. In practical terms, PSF uniformity across the FOV will\nmake observations easier to calibrate, reduce, and interpret. As\nwe discuss below, however, image quality variation is critically\ndependent on the FOV being averaged (Fig. 7). If areas near\nguide stars are included in the measure of image quality var-\nMODELING OF A WIDE-FIELD GLAO SYSTEM 1581\n2006 PASP, 118:1574\u20131590\nFig. 6.\u2014ITR vs. the ratio of seeing-limited to GLAO-corrected FWHM\n(circles), and the square of the ratio of seeing-limited to GLAO-corrected half-\nlight radius v50 (triangles) for a range of wavelengths and turbulence profiles.\nWhile both FWHM and (v50)2 ratios are good proxies for ITR, it should be\nnoted that the correlation between ITR and the (v50)2 ratio is significantly tighter.\niation, that variation will increase substantially. In general, im-\nage quality is very uniform over interesting FOVs.\n6. Strehl ratio.\u2014An important merit function for classical\nAO systems, the Strehl ratio is defined as the ratio of the PSF\npeak flux to the peak flux of the perfectly diffraction-limited\nPSF. However, Strehl ratio has little meaning for a GLAO\nsystem; at a wavelength of 1.25 mm, all codes predict less than\n2% Strehl ratios (Fig. 5).\nFor making general comparisons between the GLAO per-\nformance and seeing-limited performance, the FWHM and\nare the most useful parameters. EE is the most interestingv50\nmerit function for a specific spectrograph slit size, but the gains\nmeasured from EEs are very sensitive to the size of the slit\naperture; very small absolute GLAO performance gains will\nbe found if the aperture is significantly smaller than the FWHM,\nbecause very little light will make it through a narrow slit\naperture in either the GLAO or seeing-limited case. The largest\nabsolute and relative GLAO performance gain is found if the\naperture size approaches the GLAO FWHM (Fig. 5), which\nfollows, since the radial profile of the GLAO PSF is falling at\nthe given aperture slit width while the radial profile of the\nseeing-limited PSF is still relatively flat and near the peak value.\nWe therefore adopt the FWHM as the primary GLAO perfor-\nmance metric throughout the course of this work and cite EE\nor ITR only when relevant.\n5. PERFORMANCE OF A WIDE-FIELD GLAO\nSYSTEM\nBased on initial results of simulations that showed that the\nperformance of GLAO systems is relatively insensitive to the\nspecific LGS asterism and FOV (see \u00a7 6), a baseline GLAO\nconfiguration was adopted, which employs four sodium LGSs\narranged in a square, with each beacon 5\u0002 from the center.\nWhen used, we adopt an asterism of three equally bright NGSs\narranged in a triangle (Fig. 8; NGSs used for correcting tip-\ntilt are only used in the Monte Carlo simulations). We used\nWFSs with a relatively small number of subapertures; only\n10\u201317 samples across the diameter of the DMs or WFSs were\nused (between 77 and 227 total subapertures), depending on\nthe simulation, because a high-order correction is not necessary\nto achieve a good GLAO correction (see \u00a7 6.2.1). We averaged\nthe signal from the four LGS WFSs so that the uncorrelated\nsignal would cancel on average, leaving only the common sig-\nnal from the ground layer. The deviations in wave fronts caused\nby layers over 2 km will be uncorrelated. We modeled a GLAO\nsystem that employed an adaptive secondary mirror (first pro-\nposed by Beckers 1989) conjugated to \u000197 m, capable of\ncorrecting between 80 and 230 modes, depending on the WFS\narchitecture (\u000197 m is the conjugate altitude of the current\nnonadaptive secondary mirrors of the Gemini telescopes; as\n\u00a7 6.2.2 shows, the results of simulations are relatively insen-\nsitive to the conjugate altitude). The performance of the GLAO\nsystem was modeled at four scientific wavelengths: 0.7, 1, 1.65,\nand 2.2 mm, corresponding roughly to the R, J, H, and K bands,\nrespectively.\n5.1. Image Quality Improvement\nAt all wavelengths studied and for most model atmospheres,\nwe find that GLAO will decrease the FWHM of a PSF by\nroughly 0\u0001.1. However, the fractional change in PSF FWHM\nvaries significantly from a factor of 3.8 improvement in the\nK band with the bad : good profile, to just a factor of 1.1 im-\nprovement in the R band with the typical : bad profile. The\nperformance improvement is greatest when the ground-layer\nturbulence is large (Fig. 9). This means that the best image\nquality conditions that occur, without GLAO, only 20% of the\ntime, occur 60%\u201380% of the time with a GLAO system, trans-\nforming the cumulative distribution of image quality (Fig. 10).\nIn particular, poor image quality conditions occur only rarely\nonce a GLAO system is employed.\nThe expectation from previous studies (Rigaut 2002) was\nthat the J-band GLAO FWHM should be roughly 0\u0001.2. As\nFigures 9 and 10 show, the results presented here are more\npessimistic. Simulations of the PSF using only the free-\natmosphere turbulence showed that even for a perfect GLAO\ncorrection the FWHM is greater than 0\u0001.2 under most atmo-\nspheric conditions. We note that the full GLAO simulation of\natmospheres with \u201cbad\u201d free atmospheres yields a smaller\nFWHM than from simulations of seeing-limited observations\n1582 ANDERSEN ET AL.\n2006 PASP, 118:1574\u20131590\nFig. 7.\u2014EE in 0\u0001.2 (left) and FWHM (right) contours of the GLAO PSF for the good : good turbulence profile as measured at 2.2 mm. A FOV is marked,\u2032 \u20327 # 7\nas are each of the points simulated using PAOLA (plus signs). LGS locations are marked with filled triangles. The performance is very uniform across the FOV;\nthe separations between contours is just 1% in EE and 0\u0001.01 in FWHM. The thick lines correspond to contours of lowest EE in 0\u0001.2 (49%) and largest FWHM\n(0\u0001.19). Near a LGS, the wave-front error will be reduced because the average of the pupils will be more heavily weighted by the turbulence from the free\natmosphere in the direction of the LGS, thus leading to an improvement in image quality. Then, as one moves away from the direction of a LGS beacon, the\nperformance will drop due to anisoplanatism. However, in the direction between two LGSs, the total wave-front error will again decrease (and image quality will\nimprove) because now the wave-front error due to free-atmosphere turbulence in that direction will be measured by two LGS WFSs and will not cancel. In the\ncenter of the FOV, the image quality will again improve very slightly, as all four LGS WFSs will sense a fraction of the turbulence from higher layers. In essence,\nthe \u201cgray zone\u201d is field-dependent and is slightly higher in the field center, so more turbulence is corrected. If the scientific FOV can be chosen such that the\nLGSs are out of it, the correction across the FOV will be very uniform, which makes data reduction and calibration easier.\nthat included only the free atmosphere. This is due to the rel-\natively low altitude of the \u201cbad\u201d free atmosphere (3 km), which\nis being partially corrected by the GLAO simulations. Mea-\nsured FWHMs greater than 0\u0001.4 were initially attributed to a\nnumber of different factors, but as we show in \u00a7 6, the results\nare relatively insensitive to various trade-offs. We believe that\nthe superior GLAO performance quoted above can be primarily\nattributed to the adoption of simpler, more optimistic model\natmospheres. The larger number of ground layers for our model\natmospheres, combined with the probabilities of given atmo-\nspheric conditions occurring, produce more realistic estimates\nof GLAO performance gains (which are still significantly im-\nproved over the seeing-limited performance).\nDespite these lower estimates of GLAO-corrected FWHMs\nprovided by our models, the gains in observing efficiency are\nstill dramatic. Assuming background-limited imaging and an\noptimal point-source extraction radius, one can combine the\nGLAO gains using the model atmosphere probabilities listed\nin Table 2 to estimate GLAO efficiency gains between 1.5 and\n2.0 at different scientific wavelengths (Fig. 11). This can trans-\nlate into a substantial gain for an observatory; based on the\nGemini Observatory 2004B proposal statistics, GLAO would\nbenefit 55% of the programs (proposals requesting observations\nbetween 0.6 and 2.2 mm that do not require high-order AO)\nand would improve the efficiency of the whole observatory by\na factor of up to 30%\u201340%.\n5.2. Performance Off-Zenith\nThe performance off-zenith was studied assuming bright\nNGSs with the typical : typical atmospheric profiles. Field\nquadrant averages and standard deviations for all parameters\nmeasured at a wavelength of 1.6 mm are given in Table 5. As\nexpected, the performance decreases off-zenith. The GLAO-\ncorrected FWHM varies as a power law of air mass with an\nexponent of 0.875, while the power law without AO is 0.6.\nGLAO performance with increasing air mass will always de-\ngrade faster than in the seeing-limited case because GLAO\nincludes fitting error. Fitting error increases at the same rate as\nseeing plus anisoplanatism and will therefore degrade rapidly\nas more layers move into the gray zone described by Tokovinin.\n5.3. Laser Power Requirements\nThe UD Monte Carlo modeling tool was used to estimate\nthe laser power requirements for a GLAO system.

We note that the\nmodel considered the LGSs to be point sources and did not\ninclude spot elongation. Treating laser beacons as point sources\nresults in simulated WFS spots that are too small and are thus\naccurately centroidable with fewer photons, so the predicted\nAO performance at low light levels is overly optimistic. With\nthis caveat, we found that for 227 total subapertures, a sodium\nlaser beacon, and typical sodium layer column density, this\ntranslates to a LGS launch power less than 1 W. Although this\nis a lower limit on the required laser power, sufficient WFS\nphoton flux should be achieved with a relatively low power of\n2\u20135 W sodium LGS system. The main reasons why the required\npower is low compared to other laser AO systems is that the\nWFS signal is averaged, and the error budget for reaching the\nexpected GLAO correction is relaxed; a GLAO system does\nnot produce diffraction-limited images even in the near-IR, so\nthe required laser power is minimal.\n5.4. Sky Coverage\nTo compute the sky coverage expected for our baseline sys-\ntem, we used conservative estimates of the NGS noise per-\nformance drawn from our Monte Carlo simulations (Fig. 13)\nand assumed that (1) 100 photons per integration are required,\n(2) GLAO used a 500 Hz sampling rate, (3) the overall tele-\nscope plus detector efficiency was 60%, and (4) the WFS op-\nerated in the V band.

Assuming that the number of stars are Poisson\ndistributed and spaced randomly over the FOV, there is a 20%\nprobability that all three NGS WFS probes can be placed on\nguide stars and an 81% chance that at least one probeV ! 15\ncan be placed on a bright NGS while the other two probes\nplaced on a fainter NGS read out at a slower rate (100 Hz).\nOnly one NGS needs to be bright enough for the WFS to be\nread out rapidly and to control for telescope vibrations and\nwind shake; the gain from having three NGS WFSs versus one\nNGS WFS reading out at such a fast rate will be significantly\nless substantial.\nAs shown in Figure 7, the nonuniformity of PSFs across the\nFOV is greatest near the LGSs.

In general, the PSF uniformity is still quite high over\nthe selected FOV.\n6. TRADE STUDY SIMULATIONS\nStarting from this baseline model, we explore a large pa-\nrameter space and track GLAO performance. We study how\nthe performance of a GLAO system depends on the corrected\nfield of view, the DM actuator density (or equivalently in our\nview, the WFS sampling), and different choices relating to the\nWFSs. Because we wanted to study these trade-offs over a\nrange of relevant scientific wavelengths and the nine model\natmospheres, we primarily used analytic modeling tools to\ncarry out this work.\n6.1. FOV Trade Study\nOur analytic simulations show that the GLAO performance\ndoes improve as the FOV (i.e., the radius of the LGS asterism)\ndecreases, but the dependency between FOV and performance\nis weak; the FWHM decreases by only 18% when the area of\nthe FOV is increased by a factor of 6.25 (Fig. 15). This is not\nMODELING OF A WIDE-FIELD GLAO SYSTEM 1585\n2006 PASP, 118:1574\u20131590\nFig. 11.\u2014ITR as a function of wavelength, using DMs with 227 dof (thin\nline) and 2000 dof (thick line). This second, hypothetical DM with an enormous\nnumber of actuators represents the limit of ITR gain with a GLAO system.\nITR was calculated by using a weighted sum over the nine turbulent profiles\n(see Table 2). Increasing the actuator density can significantly increase the\nperformance of a GLAO system.\nTABLE 5\nPerformance Off-Zenith for a Typical : Typical\nAtmosphere with a Scientific Wavelength of 1.6 mm\nFWHM 0\u0001.2 EE\nZenith Angle\n(deg)\nMean\n(arcsec)\nrms\n(arcsec)\nMean\n(arcsec)\nrms\n(arcsec)\n0 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0.299 0.013 0.211 0.006\n30 . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0.338 0.012 0.177 0.006\n45 . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0.401 0.012 0.137 0.004\n60 . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0.548 0.015 0.083 0.003\nFig. 12.\u2014FWHM of science PSF at 1.6 mm as a function of LGS photon\nflux.

Smaller spots are easier to centroid, therefore requiring fewer\nphotons per subaperture to be centroidable. Larger, elongated spots will require\nmore detected photons per subaperture, making this result a lower limit on\nthe photons required to be produced by the LGSs.\ntoo surprising, as MCAO systems, which also compensate for\nturbulence in discreet layers, exhibit only weak dependencies\non the size of the FOV (e.g., Le Louarn 2002). The factor\nlimiting GLAO performance gains is the strength of turbulence\nin the free atmosphere; a simulation of the atmosphere ex-\ncluding the ground layer (all layers under 1.6 km) showed that\nthe mean seeing of a perfect GLAO system will only be 0\u0001.28\nfor a wavelength of 1 mm, assuming that the simulated atmo-\nspheres and their weighted probabilities (Table 2) are reason-\nable, compared to the mean seeing without any adaptive optics\nof 0\u0001.56.\nAlthough the performance of a GLAO system decreases as\nthe size of the corrected FOV increases, the overall survey\nefficiency (exposure time needed to survey a given area of the\nsky to a given limiting magnitude) increases. Since many of\nthe primary science cases for MCAO and GLAO systems in-\nvolve large surveys, we compared the relative survey efficien-\ncies for these AO systems. The proposed Gemini GLAO im-\naging FOV is , compared to for GSAOI\u2032 \u2032 \u2032 \u203249 # 49 2 # 2\n(Gemini South Adaptive Optics Imager, the imager for the\nGemini MCAO system). For this example, the survey efficiency\nof a GLAO system is 4 times that of a MCAO system for point\nsources. For non\u2013point sources, the ratio of observing effi-\nciency increases dramatically; for objects with FWHMs of 0\u0001.3,\nGLAO has an observing efficiency 40 times that of MCAO.7\nBecause this measure of survey efficiency does not include\nacquisition and setup times, real gains in observing efficiency\nare even greater when the additional overhead of setting up 25\nMCAO observations to cover the same FOV as a single GLAO\nobservation is taken into account. For planned GLAO systems,\nthis result suggests that the GLAO FOV be made as large as\npossible, until the extra acquisition overhead associated with\nrunning a LGS GLAO system coupled to decreasing perfor-\nmance gain outweighs the increased FOV.\n7 To be fair, MCAO will yield better angular resolution for these objects,\nenabling more science than a mere detection.\n1586 ANDERSEN ET AL.\n2006 PASP, 118:1574\u20131590\nFig. 13.\u2014FWHM of the science PSF at 1.6 mm, as a function of NGS (tip-\ntilt) photon flux.

While the GLAO performance improves as\nfield size shrinks, the gains are small; reducing the area of the FOV by a factor\nof 6.25 only improves the FWHM by 18%.\n6.2. DM Property Trade Studies\n6.2.1. Actuator Density\nAnother important dimension of the GLAO parameter space\nthat we studied was the effect of varying actuator densities on\nGLAO performance. Initial simulations used a DM with\n77 degrees of freedom (dof). If the actuator density of the DM\nwere significantly increased, we postulated that the perfor-\nmance could improve substantially because the fitting error\nwould decrease. We found that the optimal number of actu-\nators depends on both the turbulence profile and the scientific\nwavelength. In most cases, the optimal number of actuators\nis actually quite large (\u223c30 actuators across the DM, or\n\u223c700 dof). However, the performance in general is relatively\ninsensitive to the number of actuators (Fig. 16). Only 314 dof\nare needed to recover 95% of the optimal GLAO performance\nfor . As Figures 11 and 17 show, increasing thel 1 0.7 mm\nnumber of actuators has the greatest relative impact at the\nshortest scientific wavelength and when the free atmosphere\nhas very little turbulence. In both of these cases, fitting error\ndominates over other sources of error. If the goal of a GLAO\nsystem were only to deliver improved performance in the NIR,\na DM with \u223c80 dof would be adequate under most conditions.\n6.2.2. Conjugate Altitude of DM\nIf the DM in a GLAO system is conjugated to an altitude\nthat is different from the effective height of the ground-layer\nturbulence, one would expect anisoplanatism to degrade per-\nformance. However, analytic simulations of a DM that is not\nprecisely conjugated to the ground-layer atmospheric altitude\nMODELING OF A WIDE-FIELD GLAO SYSTEM 1587\n2006 PASP, 118:1574\u20131590\nFig. 16.\u2014FWHM at the field center, plotted as triangles, as a function of\nthe number of dof across the diameter of a DM. The solid horizontal line\nmarks the seeing-limited FWHM. Simulations were performed using the bad\n: good profile and four LGSs at a radius of 5\u0002 and a wavelength of 1 mm.\nFig. 17.\u2014Ratio of ITR calculated using DMs with 2000 (nact p 51 across\ndiameter) vs. 227 (nactp 17 across diameter) dof as a function of the different\nturbulent profiles (labeled ground layer : free atmosphere) for the VJK bands\n(0.55, 1.25, and 2.2 mm). The gain at the K band is slight because 227 actuators\nare sufficient to correct the ground-layer turbulence for all profiles. This is not\nthe case in the J band, where it is clear that 227 actuators are not sufficient\nto correct all the \u201cbad\u201d ground-layer turbulence. Increased actuator density\nimproves GLAO performance for \u201cgood\u201d ground turbulence the most at shorter\nwavelengths. Even 2000 actuators across the DM are probably insufficient to\ncorrect the \u201cbad\u201d ground-layer turbulence in the V band, thereby limiting the\ngain in this regime.\nshow that the performance does not suffer significantly; at\nworst, a 5% increase in FWHM is observed for the Gemini\ntelescopes (Fig. 18). We find that for a configuration of guide\nstars arranged in a pentagon, the optimal conjugation height is\n\u223c100 m, considering all results at 1\u20132.2 mm and all nine model\nprofiles. Comparing the NGS pentagon to the LGS pentagon,\nwe see that the constraint on GLAO performance from DM\nconjugate height misregistration is relaxed because of the cone\neffect. This is an important result because it means that adaptive\nsecondary mirrors can be used with Cassegrain telescopes,8\nsuch as the Gemini telescopes, and still produce GLAO per-\nformance gains.\n6.3. Guide Star Trade Studies\n6.3.1. LGSs versus NGSs\nWe find that the GLAO performance is not optimal if all\nwave-front sensing is done using NGSs. For four real asterisms\nof NGSs near the north Galactic pole, the mean and standard\ndeviation of the PSF FWHM were calculated. Variations in the\nPSF are 5% greater over the FOV if NGS versus LGS asterisms\nare used.\nFor one GLAO simulation using three NGSs, we looked at\n8 The secondary mirror of a Cassegrain telescope is conjugated to below\nthe primary mirror. For Gemini, the secondary is conjugated to 97 m below\nthe primary.\nthe morphology of the PSF in greater detail. A comparison of\nthe FWHM for the NGS and LGS system shows again that the\nuniformity of the PSF FWHM is much higher for the LGS\nsystem (Fig. 19); the standard deviation in FWHM is 34 mas\nin this NGS GLAO simulation, compared to 8 mas for the LGS\nGLAO simulation. Furthermore, the correction yields an im-\nprovement in FWHM of only 0\u0001.05, roughly half the correction\nachieved using the LGS system. We measured ellipticity\n(1 minus the axis ratio) of the isophotes corresponding to the\nradius of the FWHM. The magnitude and variation in ellipticity\nfor the LGS simulation was small; the mean ellipticity is only\n0.02. The change in shape of the PSF is roughly 2%. With\nNGSs alone, ellipticity becomes more significant: a mean el-\nlipticity of 0.10 is observed (Fig. 19). Ellipticity is a second-\norder deviation; \u201chigher order\u201d deviations to the PSF shape\nappear to be negligible. Perhaps some of these disadvantages\nassociated with using NGSs could be alleviated if even more\nNGSs were averaged and an optimal reconstruction algorithm\nwere used (Nicolle et al. 2006). Of course, one other major\nadvantage of using LGS WFSs versus NGS WFSs is that, as\ndiscussed in \u00a7 5.4, almost complete sky coverage can be\n1588 ANDERSEN ET AL.\n2006 PASP, 118:1574\u20131590\nFig. 18.\u2014FWHM of five field positions plus the seeing-limited case (see\nthe key), as a function of DM conjugation height. FWHMs were measured\nfrom the typical : typical profile at a wavelength of 1 mm.

The conjugation of the Gemini telescope secondary\nmirror is indicated by the vertical line at \u000197 m, which suffers only a 5%\ndegradation in FWHM relative to the optimal FWHM for this case.\nachieved for a GLAO system using NGS to correct only the\ntip-tilt.\n6.3.2. Number and Geometry of LGSs\nWe explored GLAO performance for a range of guide star\nnumbers and geometries. Cone effect and the altitude of the\nbeacons were not included, which simplified the model and set\naside the question of the relative placement of the high-order\nbeacons and tip-tilt beacons that must be addressed with LGSs.\nGuided by the theoretical result of Tokovinin (2004) that the\nideal beacon geometry for GLAO is a complete ring at the\nedge of the FOV, regular polygons\u2014with and without an\nadditional axial beacon\u2014were explored from a triangle to a\nheptagon. For comparison, a single axial beacon was also\ninvestigated.\nAs Table 6 shows, more beacons yield slightly better results,\nas expected. Most of the performance gains are obtained by\ngoing from one to three LGSs. The addition of extra beacons\nonly marginally improves the result when four or more beacons\nare employed. This is consistent with results reported from\nMCAO modeling (Fusco et al. 1999). Adding more beacons\nin a GLAO system means that turbulence from high layers\ncancels out better because more nonoverlapping high-layer tur-\nbulence volumes are measured by the WFSs. We suspect that\nthe cancellation of high-layer turbulence in the mean wave front\nimproves as the square root of the number of beacons.\n6.3.3. Rayleigh versus Sodium Beacons\nA comparison of the GLAO performance was made, in which\nthe only difference was a change in beacon height appropriate\nfor Rayleigh and sodium lasers. There is at best a 5% im-\nprovement if Rayleigh beacons are used, corresponding to a\nrelatively constant \u223c8 mas decrease in FWHM for the model\nturbulence profiles. This advantage stems from the fact that the\ncone effect from the lower Rayleigh beacon will be greater and\nthus less affected by high-turbulence layers.\n6.3.4. Number of Tip-Tilt Stars versus Angular Resolution\nFor a LGS WFS system, tip-tilt sensing is typically done\nwith an NGS. Given the effects of anisoplanatism, a single star\nis inadequate to correct the full GLAO field. A minimum of\nthree is required to provide compensation over the field in both\ndimensions, but the question arises as to whether even more\nstars would yield substantial improvements. Consequently, we\ninvestigated the level of tilt correction with two guide star\ngeometries: both used five sodium LGSs on a circle of\n10\u0002 diameter, with either three or eight NGSs arranged as a\nregular polygon on the same circle. We found that three NGSs\nare adequate, as the magnitude of the FWHM improvement by\nusing eight NGSs was only 10% greater than when three NGSs\nwere used (i.e., for a \u223c0\u0001.1 decrease in the GLAO FWHM,\nincreasing the number of NGSs essentially decreased the\nFWHM by just \u223c0\u0001.01).\n7. SUMMARY\nWe have used the best available measures of ground-layer\nturbulence profiles and a suite of modeling tools to study the\nperformance of a GLAO system. This work is the most com-\nplete study of GLAO to date, and our results serve to \u201cde-\nmystify\u201d GLAO. Among the many results of this study, we\nhighlight the following:\n1. The shape of the GLAO PSF is qualitatively the same as\na seeing-limited PSF. Therefore, while having complete knowl-\nedge of the PSF is desirable, the FWHM of the PSF is a\npractical and useful general metric for measuring GLAO per-\nformance. Other performance metrics are more appropriate for\nspecific applications; e.g., integration time ratio is ideal for\nbackground-limited imaging, and ensquared energy is the most\nuseful metric for spectroscopic observations.\n2. A GLAO system would significantly improve the image\nquality statistics. Unlike traditional AO systems, some of the\ngreatest gains to be had with GLAO are obtained when the\nseeing is poor. In effect, this means that the number of nights\nMODELING OF A WIDE-FIELD GLAO SYSTEM 1589\n2006 PASP, 118:1574\u20131590\nFig. 19.\u2014Comparison of GLAO correction using three NGSs of different brightnesses scattered randomly over the field (left panels) or five LGSs arranged in\na regular pentagon (right panels). For each guide star asterism (filled triangles), we show contours of FWHM (top panels) and ellipticity (bottom panels). The\nFWHM is smaller when LGSs are used (top panels have the same contours marked with thick lines); the contours, separated by 0\u0001.02, show that the NGS correction\nis between 0\u0001.02 and 0\u0001.04 worse over the majority of the FOV. More importantly, for PSF calibration, the shape of the PSF is uniform when a regular asterism\nis used. In the ellipticity figures, the lowest measured ellipticity contour ( of the PSF measured at the FWHM) is marked with a dashed line and1\u0001 b\/ap 0.02\nis a good description for most of the FOV when LGSs are used.

In addition, the sky coverage of a GLAO system will be\ngreater than that of traditional AO systems, due to the increased\nFOV and the insensitivity of the performance to most of the\nstudied variables.\nThe authors wish to thank S.
