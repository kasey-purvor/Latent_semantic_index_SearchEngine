Despite the\nhuge proliferation of experimental data and clinical\ntreatments, there has been no decrease in the death\nrates caused by the most common cancers. This is\ndespite the immense progress that has been made in\nunderstanding the causes and progression of cancer,\nparticularly from the perspective of biology. There\nhave been concomitant developments in drugs, chemo-\ntherapies and radiotherapies which together have meant\nthat several kinds of cancer now have very positive\nprognoses.\nHowever, much remains to be done on the modelling,\nearly diagnosis (critical for improved prognosis) and\neffective treatment and treatment planning of cancer.\nMathematics, in several different forms, is increasingly\nthe basis of major developments across a range of\ndisciplines in the understanding of cancer. The\nmathematics ranges from differential equations that\nmodel aspects of tumour growth to models of the\nformation of mammographic (X-ray) images, as well as\nnewer imaging modalities such as contrast-enhanced MRI\nand ultrasound.\nTo date, the mathematics of tumour formation and\nspread has developed largely independently of the\nmathematics that underpins image analysis. This paper\naims to illustrate how these two developments may\nusefully be integrated. We therefore begin with a review of\nthe mathematics of tumour growth, before presenting a\nbrief introduction to the mathematics of image analysis.\nThis allows us to go on to discuss a number of situations in\nwhich the mathematical methods and the problems\nmentioned might be usefully combined.\nThe review of the mathematical literature given in\n\u201cPrevious mathematical models\u201d describes previous\nmodels of cancer growth and proliferation. Over the past\n30 years, a number of mathematical models have been\nproposed to attempt to describe various key stages of\ntumour development. However, there is still no basic\nconsensus model of tumour growth and survival,\nmetastasis (the process whereby potentially fatal second-\nary tumours are formed from a primary tumour), tumour\nangiogenesis (whereby nutrients are diverted to the\ntumour), or the breakdown of the extracellular matrix\nISSN 1027-3662 q 2002 Taylor & Francis Ltd\nDOI: 10.1080\/10273660290015233\n*Corresponding author.\nJournal of Theoretical Medicine, 2002 Vol. 4 (1), pp. 3\u201320\ntumour cells. One of the major challenges of the next\ndecade is to develop biologically realistic mathematical\nmodels which clarify these fundamental processes and\nwhich can predict new strategies of clinical therapy.\nAlthough some of this modelling work has contributed\ntowards the search for non-invasive treatments of cancer,\nthe most effective therapeutic approach remains the\ndetection and excision of the malignant tumour and the\nsurrounding tissue. In no area is this approach more\nemotionally traumatic for the patient than in breast cancer,\nand in this case, the early detection of cancerous growths\nis vital not only to improve the chance of survival but also\nto minimise the disfigurement caused by subsequent\nsurgery. In \u201cBreast cancer detection\u201d the section, we\nsketch a number of recent advances in mammographic\nimage analysis, before focusing on a more detailed\ndescription of some of our own recent work in\nmammography, which is based on modelling of the\nunderlying physics of the image processing techniques,\nprimarily for mammography.\nIn addition to providing a vitally important tool in\nidentifying tumours, this theoretical approach can also be\nused to generate more realistic descriptions of both the\ncomposition and mechanics of breast or other types of\ntissue. In the \u201cEnhancement of image processing through\nmathematical models\u201d section we suggest ways in which\nthis information might be incorporated into the existing\nmathematical models to give more realistic and useful\ndescriptions of the physiology, and describe the\nadvantages that would accrue in terms of the detection\nand treatment of cancer.\nPREVIOUS MATHEMATICAL MODELS\nIn vivo cancer growth is a complicated phenomenon\ninvolving many inter-related processes. Solid tumour\ngrowth occurs in two distinct phases, initial growth being\ncharacterised as the avascular phase, later growth as the\nvascular phase. The transition from avascular growth to\nvascular growth depends upon the crucial process of\nneovascularisation and is necessary for the tumour to\nattain nutrients and dispose of waste products. To achieve\nvascularisation, tumour cells secrete a diffusible substance\nknown as tumour angiogenesis factor (TAF) into the\nsurrounding tissues. This has the effect of stimulating\nnearby capillary blood vessels to grow towards and\npenetrate the tumour, re-supplying the tumour with vital\nnutrient (Chaplain and Stuart, 1993). Invasion and\nmetastasis can now take place. By the time a tumour has\ngrown to a size whereby it can be detected by, in the case\nof breast-cancer, simple self-examination, there is a strong\nlikelihood that it has already reached the vascular growth\nphase. The primary aim of screening and the associated\nimage enhancement technologies is therefore to detect\ncancers prior to this stage.\nThe initial avascular growth phase can be studied in\nthe laboratory by culturing cancer cells in the form of\nthree-dimensional multicell spheroids (see, for example,\nSutherland (1988)). It is well known that these spheroids,\nwhether grown from established tumour cell lines or\nactual in vivo tumour specimens, possess growth kinetics\nwhich are very similar to in vivo tumours. Typically, these\navascular nodules grow to a few millimetres in diameter.\nCells towards the centre, being deprived of vital nutrients,\ndie and give rise to a necrotic core. Proliferating cells can\nbe found in the outer three to five cell layers. Lying\nbetween these two regions is a layer of quiescent cells, a\nproportion of which can be recruited into the outer layer of\nproliferating cells.\nMany models have been proposed to account for the\nearly stages of avascular growth. Early models considered\nsimple diffusion of nutrients and growth inhibitory factors\n(Greenspan, 1972, 1974; Adam, 1987) and showed that a\nnumber of different hypotheses on chemical kinetics and\nmode of diffusion could result in concentration profiles\nthat were not incompatible with experimental data\n(Chaplain et al., 1994). A comprehensive account of\nmodelling avascular tumour growth is given in (Marus\u02c7ic\u00b4\net al., 1994), where several mathematical models for\ngrowing multicellular spheriods are compared with\nexperimental data. Byrne and Chaplain (1996a) developed\na mathematical model for the growth of a multicellular\nspheriod that comprised a central core of necrotic cells\nsurrounded by an outer annulus of proliferating cells.\nTheir model distinguished between necrosis and apoptosis\nand considered the effect of nutrients and growth\ninhibitors.\nMore detailed and sophisticated models were later\nintroduced. For example, Byrne (1997) assumed that\ngrowth rate depends on the external supply of nutrients\nand the intercellular adhesion forces which maintain\ntumour compactness. Her model equations consider the\nspatiotemporal dynamics of nutrient concentration and\npressure within the tumour. Ward and King (1997)\ndescribe a continuum of cells which, through local volume\nchanges, create movement described by a velocity field.\nThis approach results in the evolution of a three layer\ntumour structure of proliferating, quiescent and necrotic\ncells. Stott et al. (1999) simulated growth of an avascular\ntumour embedded in normal tissue by evoking energy\nminimization to effect cell sorting between normal and\ntumour cell types, also leading to the formation of a three-\nlayered tumour structure. In Byrne and Chaplain (1996a)\nit was shown how a radially symmetric avascular tumour\ncould become unstable, possibly leading to tumour\ninvasion.\nWhen a tumour reaches a critical size, it begins to\nrelease so called angiogenesis factors into surrounding\ntissue which diffuse towards the neighbouring vasculature\ncreating a chemical gradient. Capillary sprouts are formed\nas the blood vessel wall breaks down and releases\nendothelial cells. The sprouts then grow towards the\ntumour and each other, and loops are formed in a process\nknown as anastomosis, establishing a blood supply for the\ntumour.\nD.J. GAVAGHAN et al.4\nThe process of angiogenesis has been extensively\nmodelled by Chaplain and co-workers, who consider both\ncontinuous and discrete mathematical models which take\ninto account the complex interaction of chemotactic\nagents, and endothelial cell-extracellular matrix inter-\nactions via the adhesive molecule fibronectin. By\nappropriately discretizing their continuum partial differ-\nential equation model, they develop a biased random-walk\nmodel, which allows them to track the motion of\nindividual cells. This provides a model framework\nwhich can incorporate anastomosis, mitosis and branch-\ning. The two- and three-dimensional capillary networks\ngenerated by these models compare very favourably with\nthose observed in in vivo experiments (Anderson and\nChaplain, 1998). This latter approach can also be used to\naddress metastasis and it has been shown that whereas a\ncontinuum model will predict a spreading mass, the\nprobabilistic-type model does show single cells breaking\naway from the central mass, reminiscent of observations\non mammograms showing breast cancer (Anderson et al.,\n2000).\nThe above models mostly consider the medium in\nwhich tumours grow to be homogeneous. However, in\nvivo, tissues have a high degree of fine-scaled spatial\nstructure and the paper by Anderson et al. (2000)\ninvestigates the effects of spatial heterogeneity. Math-\nematical models of cancer chemotherapy have also been\ndeveloped to investigate, for example, the use of targeted\nantibody-enzyme conjugates for the selective activation of\nanti-cancer prodrugs (Jackson et al., 2000) and the effects\nof drug resistance on the optimal scheduling of drugs\n(Murray, 1997).\nSwanson (1999) and Swanson et al. (2000) considered\ntissue heterogeneity in the case of brain gliomas, which\nare generally highly diffuse. These are usually detected\nusing computerised tomography (CT) and magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI). However, even after surgical\nexcision well beyond the visible tumour boundary, a\nrecurrence near the edge of resection ultimately results.\nThis is because the presently available imaging techniques\nonly detect a small proportion of the actual, highly diffuse,\ntumour.\nExperiments in rats show that malignant glioma cells\nimplanted in rat brain disperse more quickly along white\nmatter tracts than grey matter. Swanson (1999) and\nSwanson et al. (2000) considered a reaction\u2013diffusion\nmodel for glioma cell invasion on a two-dimensional\nanatomically accurate slice of brain tissue in which they\nimposed a spatially dependent cell diffusion coefficient to\naccount for different cell motility rates in grey and white\nmatter. Using numerical simulation, they characterised\nhow the proportion of tumour detected depended on the\ncell diffusion coefficient and cell proliferation rate. They\nalso showed that the heterogeneity within the brain caused\nthe dynamics of tumour invasion to vary significantly\ndepending on the initial location of the tumour. These\nresults have important implications on how much tissue a\nsurgeon should aim to remove when a tumour is detected.\nThe aforementioned models have resulted in a novel\nperspective on the different stages of tumour growth.\nMathematically, the models all essentially amount to\nsystems of differential equations. It is known that the\nspatiotemporal dynamics of such types of models can be\ndramatically changed if the environment is allowed to be\nspatially heterogeneous. For example, in Maini et al.\n(1992) the authors considered the problem of diffusion-\ndriven instability in a system of reaction-diffusion\nequations. They found that if they chose a bifurcation\nparameter (in their case, the ratio of chemical diffusivities)\nto vary across a one-dimensional domain, the patterns\nexhibited by the system varied in amplitude and\/or\nwavelength across the domain. In particular, they found\nthat if the parameter was chosen to be above its bifurcation\nvalue only in a sub-interval of the domain, then it was\npossible for patterns to propagate into the domain where\nlinear analysis would predict stability of the uniform\nsteady state\u2014a situation they described as \u201cenvironmental\ninstability\u201d (Benson et al., 1993). A detailed weakly non-\nlinear bifurcation analysis for the two-dimensional case\nshowed how degenerate bifurcation points could be split\nusing a spatially varying parameter (Benson et al., 1998).\nThese results show that environmental inhomogeneity\ncould be an important regulator of biological pattern\nformation.\nUnderstanding how the predictions of the above models\ndepend on the (spatiotemporally) varying material\nproperties of the matrix surrounding the growing tumour\nis one of the next key steps in the modelling effort.\nBREAST CANCER DETECTION\nThe work of Swanson and co-workers illustrates the\nimportance of tissue heterogeneity in mathematical\nmodels of cancer, and suggests that by using such models\nwe might improve the efficacy of non-invasive cancer\ndetection techniques which are based on image analysis.\nOne of the most common cancers is breast cancer, which is\ndeveloped by approximately 10% of women in first world\ncountries during the course of their lives. Early detection\nof breast cancer gives the best chance of survival, and so\nbreast self-examination is encouraged throughout the\n(Western) world. However, it has been shown that most\nwomen can only reliably detect a lump when it has\nreached a size\u2014typically 0.75 cm\u2014at which it is likely\nalready to have metastasised. While breast self-examin-\nation continues to be encouraged, not least because it\nraises the awareness of women to breast cancer, additional\nmeans of early detection are necessary.\nTo this end, screening programmes based on (X-ray)\nmammograms have been established in many countries. In\nthe UK, for example, the current breast screening\nprogramme invites women between the ages of 50 and 70\nfor breast screening. The reason for restricting screening to\nwomen in this age group is that younger, pre-menopausal\nwomen have dense breasts whose milk-bearing tissues\nBREAST CANCER: MODELLING, DETECTION 5\nstrongly attenuate X-rays, so that the resulting mammo-\ngram is often entirely white, and it is extremely difficult or\nimpossible to detect small lesions. During the menopause,\nmilk bearing tissue involutes into fat, which is radio-\ntransparent, enabling high contrast images to be taken.\nThe effectiveness of mammography for younger women\nhas not yet been established. If a mammogram displays\nany suspicious signs, the woman is invited back to an\nassessment clinic where other views and imaging\nmodalities are utilised. In other countries, for example\nthe USA, France, and Germany, there is not (yet) a\nnational screening programme; however, women are\nencouraged to have a mammogram regularly. The\nincreased awareness of breast cancer has, contrary to\nalmost all other forms of cancer, led to a slight increase in\nthe detected incidence over the past 20 years.\nIt is important, at the outset of any discussion of\nmammographic image analysis, to emphasise the need for\nmathematical modelling, and the severity of the challenge.\n. In order to reduce the radiation dose, the breasts are\ntightly compressed while a mammogram is taken. The\ncompression depends qualitatively upon the operator\u2019s\nexperience and judgement of the density of the\nwoman\u2019s breasts. The compression typically varies by\nas much as 0.5 cm at successive mammograms. To\ndate, there is no realistic model of breast compression.\nWhile such a model would have immediate application\nin image analysis, the complexity of breast anatomy\nmeans that models will inevitably be coarse approxi-\nmations for the foreseeable future.\n. Screening practice in the UK increasingly recommends\nthat two different mammogram views are taken of each\nbreast, namely cranio-caudal (CC)\u2014head to toe\u2014and\nmediolateral oblique (MLO)\u2014shoulder to the opposite\nhip. The MLO view enables axillar involvement, a\nstrong indicator of metastasis, to be detected in many\ncases. It has been demonstrated clinically that two-\nview mammography has significantly better diagnostic\noutcomes than single view mammography (as is\npractised in the screening programmes in several\nother countries). However, breasts are not cylindrical in\ncross-section, and the separation between the com-\npression plates typically differs by 1 cm from CC and\nMLO. The difference in compression and the lack of a\nreasonable model of compression implies that it is\ndifficult to combine the CC and MLO views into a\nthree-dimensional representation. We have developed\nan initial computational model to combine these\nimages, and it is sketched in \u201cMatching between\nviews\u201d below.\n. It was noted about 20 years ago that small deposits of\ncalcium salts, called microcalcifications, are often the\nearliest indicators of the presence of a tumour. The\ndetection of microcalcifications has been a major goal\nof screening programmes, hence of mammographic\nimage analysis. Microcalcifications attenuate X-rays\nstrongly (about 50 times more than normal tissue,\ncancerous tissue, or fat) and, though they are some-\ntimes obscured by normal parenchymal tissue, they can\noften be detected as small regions of high contrast in\nmammograms.\nMammographic Image Processing\nMammograms are extremely complex images for a\nradiologist (or computer program) to assess. Partly, this\nreflects the intrinsic complexity of breast tissue. It also\nreflects the relatively poor signal-to-noise ratio of the\nimages, the complexity of the image formation process,\nand the subtlety of the clinically significant signs that\nappear. While increasing numbers of women are\ndemanding mammograms, there is increasing concern\nabout the level of diagnostic accuracy of the radiologists\nwho assess those mammograms. More importantly, there\nis growing concern over the low number of radiologists\nspecialising in mammography. For these reasons, coupled\nwith the tumbling costs of computing, improvements in\nsoftware systems, and the increasing bandwidth of\ncommunications there is substantial and growing interest,\nboth within the academic community and in industry, in\ndeveloping mammographic image-analysis technologies\nto support a radiologist, either by prompting locations in\nan image, or acting as a \u201csecond reader\u201d. Indeed, evidence\nhas recently been presented that shows that the\ncombination of a radiologist and a Computer-Aided\nDetection (CAD) algorithm has significantly higher\nspecificity and sensitivity than either working alone.\nInitially, mammographic image analysis consisted\nsimply of the application of standard image analysis\ntechniques to digitised mammogram films. Such tech-\nniques comprise image enhancement, region segmenta-\ntion, feature detection, texture modelling, and image\nmatching. Most current mammographic image processing\nsystems rely on techniques borrowed from other fields. For\nexample, software used for detecting stars in the sky is\nconverted to detecting small white dots in mammograms.\nAir-force technology based on neural nets and target\nrecognition is transformed to be used for breast cancer\nrecognition. Such approaches ignore the massive differ-\nences between the imaging systems and consequently lead\nto systems which work poorly, something which is\nunacceptable in this safety-critical application. In High-\nnam and Brady (1999), Chapter 1, a detailed clinical\noverview of the breast, breast cancer, and breast cancer\nscreening using mammography is given, together with an\naccount of the use of image processing in this context.\nAs noted in the previous section, an important goal of\nmammographic image analysis has been the detection of\nmicrocalcifications (Highnam and Brady, 1999, Chapter\n11). Most of the many approaches have attempted to\ndetect regions of elevated local contrast in the intrinsically\nnoisy images. This approach has been largely unsuccess-\nful and most authors have taken recourse to non-linear\nD.J. GAVAGHAN et al.6\npattern classifiers such as neural networks in a (largely\nvain) attempt to improve the performance of the detection\nalgorithm.\nAn alternative approach is to model the physics of\nimage formation, including the mammogram-specific\nnoise processes that degrade the image, and the X-ray\nscatter that blurs the image. The first successful algorithm\nof this type was by Karssemeijer (1993), an algorithm that\nhas subsequently become the basis of the first commercial\nmicrocalcification detection system to be accorded FDA\napproval (Karssemeijer et al., 1998). The most compre-\nhensive attempt to model mathematically the physics of\nmammogram image formation is the monograph Highnam\nand Brady (1999). This has led to novel mathematics and\nalgorithms across the spectrum of clinical problems in\nbreast cancer diagnosis, and has been termed physics-\nbased modelling (PBM).\nPhysics-based Modelling (PBM)\nThe Physics of Mammographic Image Processing\nWhen a mammogram is performed, a beam of low energy\nX-ray photons is directed towards a compressed breast.\nThe intensity of the beam exiting the breast is related to\nthe thickness and type of tissue, which attenuates the\nphotons. The X-ray photons leaving the breast have to pass\nthrough an anti-scatter grid before reaching a phosphorous\nintensifying screen. If the X-ray photon is absorbed in the\nscreen, light photons are emitted by the phosphor and\nthese light photons expose a film, which is processed to\nproduce a mammogram. The exposure to the breast is\nstopped once an automatic exposure control, positioned\nunder a section of the breast, has received a set exposure.\nThis highly simplified description of the mammo-\ngraphic imaging process omits mention of a number of\nfactors which significantly degrade the mammogram.\nThese factors include: scattered radiation; \u201cbeam hard-\nening\u201d (a process, which causes the contrast in bright parts\nof the image to be reduced. The process occurs because\nlow energy X-ray photons are differentially absorbed so\nthat the beam energy rises (gets harder)); intensifying\nscreen blur (the X-ray is absorbed in the intensifying\nscreen and causes the screen to emit many light photons in\nall directions, these light photons expose the film over an\narea, not a precise point, and thus produce a blurring\neffect); and sometimes poor exposure due to the automatic\nexposure control being inappropriately located. A number\nof additional factors make it difficult to analyse\nmammograms quantitatively. These include variable\nprocessing results when developing films, system\ngeometry, and the \u201canode heel effect\u201d. The latter refers\nto the considerable variation in radiation intensity\nthroughout the volume of interest. Techniques to estimate\nand correct for it are outlined in Chapter 2 of Highnam and\nBrady (1999).\nDigitisation further complicates the system. Mathemat-\nical models have been developed based on the underlying\nphysical processes which attempt to minimise all of these\nfactors, and the most important of these are summarised\nbelow.\nMammographic Model\nHighnam and Brady\u2019s (1999) fundamental observation is\nthat on the basis of the X-ray attenuation coefficients there\nconsists only fat, \u201cinteresting\u201d tissue (fibrous, glandular,\ncancerous), and calcification. Making an initial assump-\ntion that there is very little calcification present enables the\nbreast to be considered as fat or interesting tissue. This,\nalong with knowledge of certain calibration data, such as\nbreast thickness, enables a mapping from any pixel within\na mammogram to a quantitative measure of the breast\ntissue. This is termed the hint, and its generation and\nsubsequent use for many applications including cleaning\nup pictures and simulation is the basis of the PBM\napproach.\nThe hint Representation\nThe hint representation is a normalised representation of\nthe mammogram, which is computer-generated from a\ndigitised version of the mammographic image. For each\ncolumn of breast tissue (that projects to a pixel) the\nprogram calculates the percentage of \u201cinteresting\u201d tissue\nwhich leads to a novel surface representation for\nmammography, whose value at image location (x,y ) is\nhint (x,y ). The importance of the representation is twofold.\nFirst, it enables normalisation of a mammogram by\nremoving the variations due to changing imaging\nparameters and conditions such as time of exposure and\nplacement of the automatic exposure control. Second, it\nencourages analysis of mammograms using the math-\nematics of surfaces rather than of images. For example, if\na mammogram contains a cyst, then in the corresponding\nhint representation the cyst appears as a hill with a\ncharacteristic topography.\nQuality control of breast screening centres dictates that\nmost of the calibration data required to monitor the whole\nimaging process is routinely recorded. Using this data, the\nmajor challenges in generating hint are, for analogue\nmammographic systems, collecting calibration data such\nas breast thickness, time-of-exposure, and film-screen\nparameters, and modelling the various degrading factors\ndescribed above. The steps taken to generate hint are\noutlined below.\n. Given the appropriate calibration data, the first step in\ngenerating hint is to convert the digitised image to one\nrepresenting the energy imparted to the intensifying\nscreen, as illustrated in Fig. 1. This involves knowing\nthe relationship between pixel value in the image, X-\nray exposure and energy imparted which can be\ndetermined using calibration data derived from a step-\nwedge (see Highnam and Brady, 1999 for fuller\ndetails).\nBREAST CANCER: MODELLING, DETECTION 7\n. The intensifying screen blur is then modelled using\nestablished theoretical models of how a phosphor\nintensifying screen functions. This provides a point\nspread function specific to each screen, which can then\nbe used in a deconvolution to remove the blur. This is\nillustrated in Fig. 2.\n. The scatter component at a pixel is modelled as being\nclosely related to the breast tissue in the surrounding\nneighbourhood. Using this model, together with results\nfrom numerous medical physics experiments, it is\npossible to derive a weighting mask, which describes\nthe relationship between the neighbourhood and the\nscatter component in the centre of the neighbourhood.\nFig. 3 shows an original mammogram, an energy\nimparted version and the corresponding scatter\ncomponent.\n. Extra-focal radiation is known to be a problem around\nthe edge of the breast. Models of the expected curve of\nthe breast edge are derived in order to estimate extra-\nfocal radiation penetration. The models are based upon\nFIGURE 1 The original digitised image on the left is first converted to one which represents energy imparted to the screen shown on the right. See text\nfor details.\nFIGURE 2 The image on the left shows the original energy imparted image, whilst the one on the right shows the blur removed image. See text and\n(Highnam and Brady, 1999) for further details.\nD.J. GAVAGHAN et al.8\nassumed knowledge of the breast and knowledge of its\nconstituents in certain areas.\nThe end result of this processing is a floating point\nimage where the pixel values have been converted to\nvalues representing hint. These values are quantitative and\nobjective values, independent of the imaging system itself.\nThe most obvious way for an engineer to represent this is\nas a surface, as shown in Fig. 4. However, radiologists\nhave no experience of diagnosing from surfaces and thus\nin order to show the images to radiologists the hint values\nmust first be converted back to appear like an ideal\nmammogram. This improved image then becomes the\nbasis for a wide range of image enhancement techniques.\nImage Enhancement\nBecause of the number of degrading factors involved in\nthe mammographic imaging process, the final image is\nrelatively poor compared to what an ideal image should\nFIGURE 3 An original mammogram, an energy imparted version, and the corresponding scatter component.\nFIGURE 4 An example of the hint representation.\nBREAST CANCER: MODELLING, DETECTION 9\nbe. Our modelling of the degrading factors allows us to\nremove their effects and thus guarantee a cleaner, easier to\ndiagnose image. The use of models rather than\nconventional ad hoc algorithms make it less likely that\nthe processing will introduce any artifacts or remove any\nimportant signs: vitally important in a safety-critical\napplication such as mammography. A classic example is\nof a tumour blending in to the background due to some of\nthe processes outlined above. An \u201cedge enhancement\u201d\nbutton might well sharpen up the tumour\u2019s appearance to\nmake it look benign rather than malignant.\nReducing the Radiation Dose\nModelling scattered radiation, as outlined above, enables a\nsoft removal of its effects rather than using a hard solution,\nnamely an anti-scatter grid which requires a doubling of\nthe radiation dose. Fig. 5 shows on the left a section from a\nmammogram taken with a grid and on the right the same\narea but taken without a grid and then digitally enhanced.\nDetecting Microcalcifications\nIt will be recalled that the detection of microcalcifications\nhas been a major goal of mammographic screening and\nimage analysis. Microcalcifications are quite often benign,\nfor example, they may be small deposits of calcium in\nblood vessels. The detection and the characterisation of\nmicrocalcifications as benign or malignant continues to be\na major open problem, though there has lately been some\nencouraging progress. Microcalcifications rarely exist\nsingly, and it is widely considered that the position, shape,\nFIGURE 5 Image enhancement by modelling of scattered radiation. The left image shows a section from a mammogram taken with an anti-scatter grid,\nwhilst the right image shows the same area but taken without a grid and then digitally enhanced.\nFIGURE 6 Removal of shot noise: the section on the left is an original mammogram with shot noise, i.e. dust and dirt, and on the right is the detected\nnoise shown as tiny white dots.\nD.J. GAVAGHAN et al.10\nand statistics of a cluster of microcalcifications contributes\nto the characterisation of the cluster. Recall however that\nthe breast is tightly compressed to different extents in the\nCC and MLO views. This means that the statistics of a\ncluster estimated in either view confound both the\ncompression and the projection of mammography.\nThere are four stages to this work, all based on and\nderived from our model of the imaging process. The first\nstage involves suppressing radiographic noise with\nappropriate model-based image processing, the second\nstage involves removing shot-noise due to dust and dirt\nand the third stage involves the identification of individual\nmicrocalcifications. The final stage detects clusters of\nmicrocalcifications.\nThe removal of shot noise is illustrated in Fig. 6. This\nalgorithm, based directly on the physics of the imaging\nprocess, detects 97% of all shot noise and does not remove\nany microcalcifications. The algorithm works by deter-\nmining those points which cannot possibly have been\npresent throughout the imaging process since they are too\nsharp. The maximum degree of sharpness can be\ndetermined using the physics models of the blurring\nfunctions present (Highnam et al., 1999).\nThe microcalcification detection algorithm is based\nupon a quantitative assessment of the size and contrast of\nthe suspect regions. The fundamental assumption\nunderlying the generation of the hint representation is\nthat the breast consists of only fat and interesting tissue,\nwhich is reasonable since pixels corresponding to\ncalcifications make up only a fraction of a percent of the\ntotal number of pixels. The X-ray attenuation coefficient\nof a calcification is typically 26 times that of interesting or\nfatty tissue, and is therefore equivalent to the attenuation\nthrough a much thicker layer of interesting tissue.\nCalcifications can therefore be detected by considering\nthe ratio of interesting tissue volume, computed from the\nhint surface, to the total volume of a localised region of\nbreast tissue computed from its spatial dimensions and an\nappropriate three-dimensional model. This ratio will be\nhigh for calcifications. Further details of this method can\nbe found in Highnam and Brady (1999), where the\ntechnique is shown to be working at near 97% detection of\nindividual microcalcifications with small numbers of false\npositives. This process is illustrated in Fig. 7. On a small\ndataset, this algorithm is currently returning very low false\npositives and about 98% detection of true positive\nclusters.\nMatching Between Views\nIt is often very difficult for a radiologist to observe an\nobject in both cranio-caudal and medio-lateral oblique\nviews of the same breast. The key step in aiding this task is\nto model the effects of breast compression. We have\ndeveloped models which allow a marked point in one\nimage (the round circle on the left in Fig. 9) to be matched\nto a curve of likely position in the other view (the white\ncurve on the right in Fig. 9). The six stages of the\nalgorithm to combine a cranio-caudal and mediolateral\noblique image to form a representation of the 3D\nuncompressed breast are outlined in Fig. 8.\nOur method, which is based on assumptions about\ncertain reference points and tissue movement and\nelasticity, works by mapping from a point A to the\nthree-dimensional line along which that point must lie.\nThe three-dimensional line, in the compressed breast, is\nthen uncompressed using our mechanical model of the\nbreast. It is then rotated to be in the other view and\n\u201ccompressed\u201d. Projection down onto the two-dimensional\nplane gives the corresponding line for the point. Our\nmethod is typically 2 mm closer than the radiologists\u2019.\nThe straight lines indicate where trained radiologists\nexpect the mass to be. The methods that we have\ndeveloped (Yam and Brady, 1999) perform significantly\nbetter on average than experienced radiologists.\nThe use of a model allows us to map to three-dimensional,\nif an object\u2019s position in both the two-dimensions views is\nknown. This can also be applied to microcalcifications,\nwhere two views of the same cluster can be matched and\ncombined to provide a three-dimensional representation.\nFIGURE 7 Detection of microcalcifications: the left panel shows an image which has had the shot noise removed; the right panel shows the results of\nthe detection algorithm.\nBREAST CANCER: MODELLING, DETECTION 11\nStatistics computed from the three-dimensional represen-\ntation should be more robust in differentiating between\nbenign and malignant microcalcifications than their two-\ndimensional counter-parts.\nDetecting and Removing CLS\nCurvi-linear structures (CLS) in mammograms arise for a\nvariety of reasons including fibrous strands, blood vessels\nand the lymphatic system. Apart from their intrinsic\ninterest, the CLS greatly complicate the visual appearance\nof a mammogram and make the detection of masses\n(benign or malignant) more difficult.\nSeveral approaches have been pursued to detect the\nCLS in mammograms. First, conventional feature\ndetectors do not give good results, largely because the\nelevation in intensity at points perceived as belonging to a\nCLS is often slight, and the whole image region is noisy.\nInstead, we model CLS both spatially (local linear\nstructures) and in 3D as being structures of elliptic profile\nfull of interesting (non-fat) tissue (Highnam and Brady,\n1999; Cerneaz, 1994). Then, by modelling the image\nformation process, the expected visual appearance of a\nCLS is derived. The model is then used to detect such\nCLS. This algorithm, developed by Cerneaz (1994), works\nonly on a single spatial scale, whereas CLS occur at a wide\nFIGURE 8 The six stages of the algorithm to combine a cranio-caudal and mediolateral oblique image to form a representation of the 3D\nuncompressed breast.\nFIGURE 9 Tracing the movement of objects in moving from the cranio-caudal to the medio-lateral oblique views of the same breast.\nD.J. GAVAGHAN et al.12\nFIGURE 10 Removing CLS: the modelling allows the structures shown in the right image to be determined from the original mammogram shown on\nthe left.\nFIGURE 11 The image on the left was taken in 1992, whilst that on the right is from 1996.\nBREAST CANCER: MODELLING, DETECTION 13\nrange of spatial scales in mammograms. More recent\nwork (Zwiggelaar et al., 1996) attempts to detect CLS\nusing a set of \u201cmodal variations\u201d determined by principal\ncomponents analysis on a training set of idealised cases\nof CLS. Current work aims to apply recently developed\ntechniques for feature detection, based largely on the\nobserved phase congruency of features. Fig. 10\nillustrates this method and shows an original\nmammogram and the curvilinear structures determined\nby this process.\nDetecting Masses\nDetecting masses on the basis of matching temporal and\nbilateral mammograms can be done by building up a\nrepresentation of each breast which accurately reflects the\ninternal anatomy (Kok-Wiles et al., 1998). Assumptions\nabout compression and movement over time are then used\nto match those structures. An alternative approach that is\nbeing developed is to warp one outline onto the other\noutline and to use internal land-marks to aid that process.\nIn Figs. 11 and 12 this is illustrated for mammograms\ntaken 4 years apart. In this example, a mass is detected on\nthe basis of there being no corresponding match in the\nearlier mammogram: the marked region in Fig. 12 is\nindicative of a newly formed mass, in this case cancer.\nThe work in Marias et al. (2000) has resulted in a robust\nregistration framework for comparing temporal mammo-\ngrams. This non-rigid system uses a two-step approach for\nfirstly deforming the images using a curvature analysis of\nthe breast boundary and secondly, utilising internal\nlandmarks to complete the complex internal deformation\nof the breast, typically due to the slightly different\ncompression characteristics of successive mammograms.\nA good example of this process is shown in Fig. 13 where\nFIGURE 12 The results of the matching algorithm applied to the\nimages shown in Figure 11. The marked region is cancerous.\nFIGURE 13 Registration of temporal mammograms for screening, postoperative assessment and pathology comparison.\nD.J. GAVAGHAN et al.14\na patient has had 4 years of successive mammograms\nwhere in year 4, some coarse calcifications indicative of\nDCIS (ductal carcinoma in-situ ) were observed. This is a\nparticularly interesting case as the patient had previously\nundergone an upper-quadrant mastectomy to remove an\nearlier lesion and it was uncertain whether or not the\ncalcifications were due to surgical scarring or an active\nlesion.\nThis elastic matching of temporal mammograms\nextends very naturally to screening, where compensation\nfor changes in compression and geometrical normalisation\nenables much better comparison between changes in\nbreast tissue. This has been shown to be applicable to\ninterval cancers and the evaluation in local changes due to\nHRT (Marias et al., 2000). Fig. 14 shows a typical\nexample where an interval cancer has appeared in a patient\nscreening and where registration has enabled a retro-\nspective evaluation of the tumour pathology (and\nconsequentially the clinical decision making).\nCombining Information from Mammography and\nMRI\nAlthough screening mammography is critical for early\ncancer detection and has been shown to have significantly\naffected mortality statistics in women (Kok-Wiles et al.,\n1998), mammography is not particularly useful for\ndiagnosis in young women, women with dense breast\ntissue (perhaps due to HRT) and women who have already\nhad surgical intervention. In these cases, other modalities\nsuch as contrast-enhanced MRI and ultrasound have an\nimportant role in understanding the pathology and tissue\ncharacteristics.\nIn the case of DCIS, the typical indicator in\nmammography is coarse, highly localised clusters of\nmicrocalcifications. The work by Highnam et al. (1996)\nwith respect to hint normalisation makes the detection of\nthe calcifications quite robust. However in younger\nwomen, or women with dense breast tissue, it is difficult\nto differentiate the extent of the pathology from the rest of\nthe parenchyma. Contrast-enhanced MRI provides comp-\nlementary information about the tumour by enhancing the\nangiogenesis of the breast pathology. The use of a\npharmacokinetic model (Kaiser, 1990; Tofts and Ker-\nmode, 1991; Hoffman et al., 1995; Heyton et al., 1997) to\nsegment the cancer has been shown to be diagnostically\nuseful (Behrenbruch et al., 2000). Such pharmacokinetic\ntechniques are based on a model of gadolinium chelate\nuptake and exchange between blood plasma and the tissue\nextracellular space. By parameterising the contrast\nenhancement with such a model, it is possible to segment\nenhancing regions on the basis of the rate and amplitude of\ncontrast uptake. The problem with DCIS is that it typically\ndoes not enhance well with MRI (due to the lack of\nextensive blood supply other than from the ductal tissue)\nand therefore is often missed in an MRI examination.\nOur current research (Behrenbruch et al., 2000)\ninvolves using a projection of the contrast enhancement\ninformation and non-rigid registration to match the\ngeometry of the two mammogram views (CC and MLO)\nto the geometry of the MRI acquisition. This data fusion\napproach enables indicators such as calcifications to be\nresolved in the reference frame of the MRI volume. This\nenables the radiologist to detect better subtle enhancement\nthrough knowing the location of calcifications in three-\ndimensional. This three-dimensional reconstruction\napproach is complementary to the work in Yam and\nBrady (1999) although it provides additional information\nby fusion of the structural representation in the\nmammogram with the functional representation of MRI.\nAn example of this is shown in Fig. 15a where three\nclusters of calcifications are seen in the two mammogram\nviews and have been reconstructed in the geometrical\nreference frame of the MRI scan. It was then possible for\nthe clinician to look at a specific region of the MRI scan\nfor subtle enhancement (shown in Fig. 15b).\nFIGURE 14 An interval cancer compared using non-rigid registration of temporal mammograms. The interval cancer was actually present (but\nundetected) in the first mammogram.\nBREAST CANCER: MODELLING, DETECTION 15\nThe comparison of pathological indicators is not\nrestricted to DCIS, however. In terms of understanding\nthe relationship between the imaged structure of a tumour\nand the functional characteristics, X-ray\/MRI data fusion\nprovides complementary information for pathology\nassessment (Behrenbruch et al., 2000). An example is\nshown in Fig. 16, where a large, poorly differentiated\ncarcinoma appears in the mammogram as a dense,\nspeculated mass. The clinical response to such a mass\nwould typically be a localised excision as it is a large, but\nrelatively contained pathology with very little connective\nvascularity. However, analysis with the MRI \u201cfunctional\u201d\nrepresentation shows that in fact the tumour has two foci,\nindicating a more invasive grade of cancer which may\nhave a different treatment requirement.\nData fusion is likely to be an important aspect of future\nwork involving modelling of the growth characteristics of\ncancer, particularly if correspondence between dynamic\nimaging techniques and the results of drug treatment\nregimes can be understood. Current research involves\nstudying the effects of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy on the\npharmacokinetic enhancement of breast MRI (Moore\net al., 2001). By using non-rigid registration combined\nwith robust segmentation algorithms (that once again use\nphysics-based models to perform T1 correction of\ngadolinium enhancement (Armitage and Brady, 2000))\nwe have been able to quantify the change in angiogenesis\nof a tumour within the framework of oncological models\nfor tumour proliferation. In the future, this research may\nform the basis of an inverse problem that may provide a\nbetter understanding of cancer growth. Fig. 17 shows an\nexample of a visualised change in vascularity due to neo-\nadjuvant chemotherapy.\nPBM in Simulation and Teaching\nThe modelling of the imaging process provides all the\ninformation necessary to teach radiographers.

An example might be a\nsphere filled with non-fat tissue. After addition to the hint\nsurface, the X-ray process can be simulated to show how\nthat object might appear. In this way, cancers can be added\nto many previously normal mammograms and used to\nmonitor radiologists\u2019 performance and help teach, \u201cwhat\nwould it look like if there was a mass just there?\u201d. This can\nbe advanced to become a diagnostic tool: \u201cthis mass when\nadded to the breast looks like the mass which is actually\npresent, therefore I know the properties of the present\nmass and can use those parameters to help me diagnose\u201d.\nHowever, accurate simulation requires parameters relating\nto tumour growth, tumour shapes, and how tumours\ndeform under compression.\nENHANCEMENT OF IMAGE PROCESSING\nTHROUGH MATHEMATICAL MODELS\nIn the above reviews we have given a brief outline\nof recent developments in the mathematical modelling\nof cancer development, and of recent advances in\nbreast mammography using PBM. As we suggested\nin the Introduction, the information gained from this\napproach to image analysis can be incorporated into\nexisting models to give improved mathematical descrip-\ntions of the physiology, which can then in turn be used\nto help overcome some of the current challenges in\nimage processing and hence improve the detection of\ncancer.\nCurrent Challenges in Image Processing\nThe appearance of a mass in an intensity image depends\nstrongly on the compression of the breast. Benign masses\ntend to have sharper boundaries, whereas malignant\nmasses blend more gradually into their surroundings.\nSince it is not obvious how to combine a number of\nsuch features into a decision, most research involves\ntraining neural networks. The best (clinical) performance\nreported to date is about 70% correctly labelled\nmasses, that is to say it could not be relied upon for\nthree women in 10 presenting with a lump! It is therefore\nimportant to study the ways in which mathematical\nmodels might be used to suggest features that \u201ccharac-\nterise\u201d a mass and that are stable\/invariant under small\nchanges in compression.\nIncreasingly, radiologists take both a cranio-caudal\n(CC) and a medio-lateral oblique (MLO) mammogram,\ntypically angularly separated by 608. However, the\nproblem is substantially more complicated than the\nwide-angle stereovision problem because the breast is\ncompressed to a significantly different extent in the two\nviews. This problem necessitates the incorporation of\nmore realistic mathematical models into the development\nof better algorithms for matching a CC to a MLO\nmammogram. This would open the way to the solution of\ntwo important problems:\n. microcalcification clusters could be viewed as three-\ndimensional constellations. The overlapping projec-\ntions of those clusters in a mammogram could be\nseparated. Spatial (three-dimensional) statistics could\nbe derived for each cluster; statistics of projected\nclusters are misleading. The spatial structure of a\ncluster is conjectured by radiologists to be an important\nindicator of malignancy. For example, if there are many\nmicrocalcifications within a 1 cm cube then that cluster\nis more likely to be malignant.\n. There has been debate among radiologists about the\nexistence or otherwise of a \u201chalo of safety\u201d surround-\ning a mass in a mammogram, and, if it exists, whether it\nis relevant to a diagnosis of malignancy. Highnam et al.\n(1996) developed the first quantitative measure for\nsuch a halo, and presented evidence that if its size is\nconsistent between an MLO and a CC mammogram\nthen it is strongly suggestive of malignancy. If this\nconjecture turns out, after rigorous experimentation, to\nbe correct, then a CC-MLO algorithm would give\nadditional important information to characterise the\nmass.\nImproving the Mathematical Models\nDevelopment of a Model of Breast Compression\nThe above points illustrate the importance of developing a\nsequence of increasingly realistic models of breast\ndeformation under compression, and of incorporating\nthem into image analysis algorithms to improve on those\ndeveloped to date. Mathematical modelling of soft-tissue\ndeformation is an area of much current research, with\nprimary application areas being in medical simulation\n(e.g. surgical simulators), whole-heart modelling, soft\nconnective tissue and solid tumour modelling (e.g.\ncartilage and intervertebral discs) (Fung, 1993; Skalak\net al., 1996; Byrne and Chaplain, 1996b; Netti et al., 1997;\nDelingette, 1998; McCulloch et al., 1998). The math-\nematical approach taken is largely determined by the\napplication: in surgical simulation, of primary\nimportance is speed of computation, and linear elasticity\ntheory is commonly used; in whole heart, and for\nmodels of breast deformation, modelling accuracy of\ndeformation is paramount and the much more complex\nfinite deformation elasticity theory must be used. A\nmajor problem arising in modelling the deformation of the\nbreast is the number of biological structures that are\npresent, each with different elastomechanical properties,\nwith each giving varying constitutive laws throughout\nthe breast.\nThe constitutive laws required in developing such\nmodels depend crucially on the materials that are being\ndeformed. The geometry of the breast is also important,\nD.J. GAVAGHAN et al.18\nand basic breast anatomy can now be determined from\ndigitised MRI images. A three-dimensional finite element\nmodel for a particular heterogeneous breast must\nincorporate a realistic representation of the three-\ndimensional domain incorporating descriptions of the\nspatial arrangements and heterogeneous mechanical\nproperties of the different tissues. This may be developed\nfrom the results of matching the CC-MLO mammograms,\nor from contrast-enhanced MRI data. The influence of age\non tissue must also be considered.\nDevelopment of a Model of Tumour Growth in Spatially\nHeterogeneous Tissue\nA mathematical model such as that described above would\nprovide insight into the effects on anatomical structures of\nphysical compression from different directions, the way\nthat abnormal (both malignant and benign) structures\ninteract with the local tissues; and the tissue composition\nof anatomical structures. The information is now available\nto provide a detailed map of the spatial heterogeneity of\nbreast tissue within specific breasts. Using the mathemat-\nical modelling techniques outlined in \u201cPrevious math-\nematical models\u201d, it should therefore be possible to build a\nmathematical model of cancer growth from its initial\ninception right through to metastasis. Such models would\nbuild on existing work on tissue growth due to internal\ndynamics (Dillon, 2001). By \u201cgrowing\u201d a breast-specific\ncancer in a breast in this way, and by using realistic\ncompression models, one could determine where and how\nthat cancer will appear in both cranio-caudal and medio-\nlateral oblique mammograms. The model would provide\ninformation to radiologists about the 3D shapes and\ncompositions of abnormalities. Additionally, since\ntumours are rarely seen in a breast screening clinic, the\nability to summon up simulations on demand could be a\npowerful teaching tool as well as proving useful in testing\nimage analysis algorithms and allowing in-service testing\nof radiologists.\nAcknowledgements\nDJG would like to thank the Medical Research Council for\na Career Development Fellowship.\nReferences\nAdam, J.A.
