A secondary function of the package is to support microwave\nengineers by providing a library of utilities to assist their design function. All three\nprograms were written in Visual Basic and are aimed at supporting both tutor-directed\nand student-centred learning methodologies. The development team consisted of three\nfinal-year degree students.\nProgram 1 is Smith Chart. The Smith Chart is one of the most important tools for the\nmicrowave engineer, yet students find the concepts of its application difficult to grasp\nusing traditional teaching methods. Students can choose between running an animated\ntutorial or using the chart, in stand-alone mode, to solve problems.\nProgram 2 is Microwave Laboratory. This is a virtual microwave laboratory and includes\nall the waveguide components one would reasonably expect to see in such a laboratory.\nThe components can be connected in any combination, and a generator and detector can\nthen be connected to the completed circuit's remaining ports. Important parameters can\nbe varied by the student, and results in terms of power or Voltage Standing Wave Ratio\n(VSWR) can be observed.\nProgram 3 is Microwave Device Technology, and is a hypertext interpretation of lecture\ncourse notes describing a wide range of devices at three levels of complexity. Level 1\nS7\nColin White Microwave workshop for Windows\nEU Iocls jftew b\u00ablp\nRaaxtma R u t e n\n;\nDigna IRtfOafl(fi AtMnurfjen\nVSWR 103.50 I\nFUlaeL Golf 109.\u00ab \\t |0\u00ab5- I\nkj 1-0.5731\nIMPEDANCE MODE\nFigure I: Smith Chart\nreflects the requirements of a Higher Diploma unit, Level 2 corresponds to final-year\ndegree level, and the highest level supports postgraduate teaching within the institution.\nAll three programs include extensive help files which describe not only program operation\nbut also context-sensitive microwave theory and device descriptions.\nSmith Chart\nThe currently accepted form of the Smith Chart was developed by Philip H. Smith in\n1936, and is now extensively used by microwave and radio-frequency engineers to aid\ndesign work. The chart is a two-dimensional graph with real and imaginary axes (argand\ndiagram) on which can be mapped complex impedance points such as those which may\nexist along a high-frequency cable or transmission line. The chart may be used to\ncalculate the value of the impedance at the end of the line (the load impedance), or\nalternatively the length of a transmission line necessary to achieve an impedance match.\nThe chart does not provide answers which could not be derived by someone of a good\nmathematical grounding armed with a calculator; rather, it performs the function of a\nspecial-to-type slide rule to speed up such calculations.\nThe individual steps required to perform the calculations using the chart are actually\nquite trivial. The difficulty students have in grasping the operations is, I believe, due in\npart to their inability to equate real and measurable quantities, such as voltage and power\nwhich exist along a transmission line, into coordinates and lines on the somewhat abstract\nconcept of a chart. Indeed, some students successfully complete calculations on the chart\nby rote, with little knowledge of the underlying philosophy. The students' cognitive\ndifficulty is further compounded by the fact that the two axes of the chart are circles and\nsegments of circles respectively, and they are also highly non-linear. Finally, the confusion\n58\nALT-} Volume 3 Number I\nis exacerbated by virtue of one of the major attributes of the Smith Chart: each\ncoordinate point represents firstly a complex impedance value, secondly the value of the\nreflection on the transmission line (the VSWR) and finally the distance of the point on the\nline from the line's termination. It is small wonder that students have trouble when faced\nwith a real problem to solve, and given only a blank, black-and-white chart which is\nremote from any real hardware.\nIn such situations a coloured CAL animation becomes an extremely powerful learning\ntool. The Smith Chart tutorial takes the student in a step-wise manner from construction\nof the chart itself through to incremental problem solving. Students are at all times in\ncontrol of the progression of the program, and hence their pace of study. Colour is used\nto highlight relevant areas of an otherwise invariable chart, and this is mirrored with\nhighlighted points along a drawing of an actual transmission line. Movement around the\nchart corresponds to movement along the transmission line, and student-selectable\nanimations are used to good effect to illustrate these aspects.\nThe, Smith Chart utility is a fully operational chart on which all functions that would\nnormally be carried out with a paper chart, pencil, ruler and compasses (and probably\nrubber!) can be performed by keyboard and mouse-click and displayed as accurately as\nthe screen resolution will allow. A Magnify button is included for situations where screen\nresolution is a limiting factor. Results are as accurate as the computer's arithmetic\nprecision has been set, rather than governed by the thickness of the pencil lead, and it is,\nconsequently, orders of magnitude better than the traditional method. As the cursor is\nmoved around the chart by the mouse, the corresponding impedance value is updated in\nreal time. This dynamic nature, again, aids the students' understanding of the chart as\nthey acquire a better feeling for the impedance values in different areas of the chart than\nthey ever would by merely reading off the scales. Finally, although unnecessary in the\nnormal course of events, a calculator button is included for emergencies.\nAlthough this is not the only software implementation of the Smith Chart available, it is\nthe only one designed primarily for teaching purposes. It is also the most intuitive and,\nperhaps most significantly, the only implementation which runs under Windows.\nMicrowave Laboratory\nMicrowave Laboratory is an accurate visual representation of a real teaching microwave\nlaboratory. All the common components are represented. They are taken individually, as\nrequired, from the virtual component store, and drag-dropped onto the virtual test bench\nwhere they are automatically connected together if dropped adjacent to another\ncomponent. In this manner, a complete circuit may be built up, and the input\/output\nports are connected to the microwave generator and receiver respectively. These, again,\nare accurate representations of commercially available equipment.\nDevices capable of parameter variation are adjusted using a control pane launched by\ndouble-clicking the device. To aid the construction of an elegant arrangement of the\ncircuit on the workbench, any device can be reoriented in 90\u00b0 steps by pressing the Rotate\nbutton. Further, any device can be deselected by dragging it to the Mac-style dustbin.\n59\nColin White Microwave workshop for Windows\nOnce a circuit has been constructed, the generator power and frequency can be selected\nand then switched on. First, the circuit is checked for validity by confirming that the\nworkbench contains one launcher, one or two detectors, no open ports and no loops.\nEach device in the circuit defines a square array-type variable of order equal to the\nnumber of ports. This device array fully defines the device characteristics. A matrix\nmultiplication routine calculates the power at the detector and displays it on the virtual\nAmp in digital and analogue format. If a standing wave detector has been selected, power\nis also displayed graphically in a pane below the workbench, as a function of length along\nthe transmission line.\nThe usual Windows menus or short-cut keys allow any useful circuits to be saved and\nthen opened at a future date or, indeed, to be printed.\nCertain common devices are not available in the device store. There are, however, sound\npedagogic reasons for this. By way of example, consider the wavemeter. This is a device\nused to measure very accurately, but with much time and effort, the output frequency of\nthe generator. It is obvious that the frequency accuracy of the virtual generator is defined\nby the program's mathematical precision and is certainly orders of magnitude better than\nthe real wavemeter. There is, therefore, no reason to specify a wavemeter and, perhaps\nmore importantly, the measurement of accurate frequency can detract from the main aims\nof the experiment.\nThis laboratory simulation will model all the usual microwave experiments quickly,\nefficiently and accurately, but it important that students do not perceive it as the real\nworld. The program is intended to support traditional experimental procedure but not to\nreplace it. Typically, the student is given some time on the package, constructing the\ncircuit and measuring relevant parameters before doing it for real. By this means he or she\nacquires an overview of what each device does, what happens when they are connected in\na particular configuration, and the particular measurement technique to be learned by the\nexperiment. An important part of the learning strategy is in the interpretation of\nmeasurement discrepancy between the virtual and the real laboratories.\nMicrowave Device Technology\nThe third program is simply a hypertext implementation of microwave course notes. The\nnotes reside in three levels representing HND, final level degree and MSc teaching. The level\ncan be switched at any point in the device descriptions to enable a lower-level student to\nread about a particular device at a higher level, if required (or even desired!). The program\nhas been used in a traditional lecture environment using a laptop and overhead tablet as a\ncleaner alternative to chalk. Students have access to the notes on the network and they can\nprint out any or all of the levels, as required, for study remote from a terminal.\nFuture work\nFuture work will involve both improvements to the existing programs and also additions\nof new programs to the workshop suite.\n60\nALT-} Volume 3 Number I\nThe Smith Chart presently supports only calculations on one impedance point.\nOccasionally it is necessary to work with two points and, for instance, calculate the\nimpedance difference. A future version will incorporate this facility.\nThe Microwave Laboratory can support only devices specified in the device store. It is a\ntrivial addition to include a user-defined black box which may be connected on the\nworkbench. In this case, by double-clicking on the black box, the user may write directly\nto the defining array the parameters of some device not included in the store.\nHowever, a non-trivial addition to the microwave laboratory could be the inclusion of a\nswept-frequency generator and amplitude analyser. This would open up a range of more\nsophisticated experiments involving frequency response measurement techniques.\nThe Microwave Device program will soon have device diagrams reinforced by colour\nscanned images of the devices.\nAs for additional programs, a microstrip version of the laboratory simulator is planned\nwhich is thought to be of interest to commercial companies, and an antenna design CAL\npackage and design utility.\n61\n"}
