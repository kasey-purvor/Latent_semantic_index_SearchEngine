INTRODUCTION\nTHERE has been a widespread commercial interest in de-veloping vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL)\ndevices emitting near 1.3 m for optical fiber communication\nsystems. The advantages of such devices over the incumbent\nedge-emitting laser (EEL) devices include lower threshold cur-\nrents, a circular beam output that is ideal for fiber coupling,\nand the low manufacturing cost of producing two-dimensional\ndevice arrays. Until recently however, viable 1.3- m emitting\nVCSELs have been hampered by two key problems. First, the\nmaterial systems available at this wavelength are limited due\nto the lack of suitable epitaxial layers with high enough re-\nfractive index contrast to form the distributive Bragg reflec-\ntors (DBRs). For example, the widely used EEL system of In-\nGaAsP\u2013InP shows limited performance in VCSELs [1] due to\nManuscript received February 26, 2003; revised July 29, 2003.\nG. Knowles, R. Fehse, S.

Other approaches, such as fusing the InGaAsP ac-\ntive region to the AlGaAs\u2013Gas DBRs [2] lead to high electrical\nresistance at the p-junction. Second, low-cost applications re-\nquire stable uncooled operation over a wide range of tempera-\nture. This presents a specific difficulty for VCSELs as the lasing\nenergy of the cavity mode has a different temperature depen-\ndence to that of the peak of the optical gain spectrum. Strategies\nto minimize this, employed at other wavelengths, involve broad-\nening the gain spectrum by the use of several different multi-\nquantum wells [3], [4] or using the contributions of higher sub-\nbands [5]. However, this has the effect of reducing device effi-\nciency by requiring nonlasing states to be pumped.\nRecent reports of material systems, which can be lattice\nmatched to GaAs substrates and have been demonstrated\nin operational VCSELs are InGaAs quantum dots [6] and\nGaAsSb\u2013GaAs quantum wells [7]. However, the most en-\ncouraging performances so far have been shown by using the\nmaterial GaInNAs where appropriate mixtures of N and In\nin GaInNAs can be grown pseudomorphically on GaAs, for\nlow N concentration [8]\u2013[11]. Monolithically grown GaInNAs\nVCSELs have already been demonstrated, producing 1.43 mW\n(at 1.26 m) [12] and 500 W (at 1.28 m) under contin-\nuous-wave (CW) operation at room temperature [13]. There is\nalso experimental evidence that GaInNAs has an intrinsically\nbroad gain spectrum due to different bandgaps arising from\nstatistical fluctuations in N density and alternative stable lattice\nN sites [14] (originating from different ratios of Ga and In\nas nearest neighbors) enabling a wide temperature operating\nrange for VCSELs.\nIn this paper, we report the measured temperature and pressure\ndependenceof the thresholdcurrentof1.3- memittingGaInNAs\nVCSELs and also the equivalent EELs employing nominally\nidentical active regions. We have then used the experimentally\ndetermined temperature variation of the main recombination\nprocesses measured in the EELs and a theoretical model to\ncalculate the expected temperature and pressure dependence of\nthe VCSEL threshold current. The model is based on a realistic\n10-band k.P Hamiltonian developed by Tomic\u00b4 and O\u2019Reilly\n[15]. The results show a good agreement between the model and\nthe experimental data and support the validity of the recombina-\ntion rate parameters and the model.

Schematic illustration of the intracavity-contacted configuration of the\nGaInNAs VCSEL.\nVCSELs operate over a wide temperature range making them\npromising devices for communication applications.\nII. THE STRUCTURES\nThe GaInNAs VCSEL structure, which was grown and\nfabricated by Infineon Technologies is shown in Fig. 1. It is of\nthe intracavity-contacted configuration and the epistructure was\ngrown by solid source molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) using\nan RF-coupled plasma source to produce reactive monatomic\nnitrogen from nitrogen gas. The active region consists of two\nGaInNAs quantum wells (QWs) containing 2% nitrogen\nsandwiched between 28 top and 34 bottom pairs of undoped\nAl Ga As\/GaAs DBRs. An oxidisable layer of AlAs\nadjacent to the cavity was used to form a current aperture of\napproximately 9- m diameter. A more detailed description can\nbe found in [13], together with further information on growth\nissues.\nThe device was designed to emit at 1.3 m at room tem-\nperature with the QW tuned on the high-energy side and de-\nsigned to have a peak gain at 1.29 m. The EEL was a simple\n350- m-long, 4- m-wide ridge waveguide laser structure em-\nploying a similar active region to the VCSEL but with three\nQWs and also designed to emit at 1.29 m at room tempera-\nture.\nIII. PRESSURE MEASUREMENTS\nThe pressure experiments were carried out with a piston in\ncylinder system [16] using \u201cEssence F\u201d as the pressure fluid.\nLight from a mounted device was coupled into an optical fiber\nthreaded through and embedded within the piston using epoxy\nresin and magnesium oxide. The electrical contacts were sealed\ninto the piston using conical Vespel seals. In all the experiments\ndescribed, a pulsed current is used (0.5% duty cycle with a 500\nm pulsewidth) to avoid any heating effects. Previous reports\nof pressure on GaInNAs EELs have shown two particular ef-\nfects distinct from AlGaInAs and InGaAsP at this wavelength\n[17]. First, there is a sublinear increase of the lasing energy, due\nto the interaction of the conduction band edge with the N level\n(not discernable in this experiment). Second, there is a rise in\nthe threshold current with increasing pressure in contrast to In-\nGaAsP suggesting an unusual increase of Auger recombination\nFig. 2. Schematic illustration of the tuning\/detuning effect in VCSELs due to\nthe different pressure dependence of the gain peak and cavity-mode energies. In\nthis instance i) the gain peak is tuned on the low-energy side of the cavity mode at\nP = 0. ii) Increasing pressure brings about ideal gain-cavity alignment and iii)\nfurther pressure eventually causes a detuning of the gain peak on the high-energy\nside of the cavity mode.\nwith pressure [18]. Pressure applied to the VCSEL will have a\nsimilar effect on the active region as in the EEL, but there will\nbe an additional effect of a change in gain-cavity alignment as\nthe cavity resonance and the gain peak energies have different\npressure dependences [19], as illustrated in Fig. 2.\nThe measured lasing energy pressure dependences\nfor both the EEL and the VCSEL are shown in Fig. 3. At\natmospheric pressure the peak of the gain given by the of\nthe EEL ( 970 meV) is on the high energy of the cavity mode\n( 949 meV). As the pressure is applied, the for the EEL\nincreases at a rate of 73 meV (GPa) compared\nwith 17 meV (GPa) for the VCSEL, leading to\na detuning rate with pressure of 56 meV(GPa) .\nExtrapolating these rates backward beyond zero pressure,\nthere is a \u201cvirtual\u201d crossover (ideal gain-cavity alignment) at\n0.4 GPa. As thermal tuning\/detuning occurs in the oppo-\nsite sense to pressure, this indicates that atmospheric pressure\n( 0 GPa) gain-cavity alignment is found well above room\ntemperature. The way this detuning affects the pressure\ndependence of the VCSEL can be seen in Fig. 4 together with\nthe equivalent measured data for the EEL. There is a rapid\nincrease in for the VCSEL, which can partly be explained\nby the detuning on the steeper low-energy side of the gain peak\n[19], which means that the device requires a higher current\ndensity to reach threshold. Further to this, however, since\nmonomolecular and Auger recombination are both functions\nof carrier density [20] and as the threshold carrier density\nincreases with pressure due to an increase in effective mass so\nthe detuning couples to these two loss mechanisms causing the\nparticularly steep increase of with pressure seen here.

Pressure dependence of both E for the VCSEL determined by the cavity-mode pressure dependence and E for the EEL, which lases close to\nthe peak-gain energy. As the VCSEL is tuned with the gain-peak on the high-energy side of the cavity mode at room temperature and pressure (RTP), increasing\npressure results in a detuning effect shown by diverging E for EEL and VCSEL devices.\nFig. 4. Pressure dependence of I for VCSEL and EEL. For the EEL the small increase in I with pressure is close to ideal where I = E . For the VCSEL,\nhowever, the detuning effect with increasing pressure causes a rapid increase in I as detuning couples to increased Auger and monomolecular recombination.\nis also a rise in for the EEL above the ideally expected\n[21], which only appears small compared with the\nVCSEL on the scale of Fig. 4.\nIV. TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE MEASUREMENTS\nThe temperature dependence measurements were carried out\nusing a static exchange gas cryostat allowing the temperature\nto be varied between 77 and 400 K. The measured\ntemperature dependence for the EEL is shown in Fig. 5 together\nwith calculated for the VCSEL [ measured at room\ntemperature (RT)]. The rate at which the cavity mode changes\nwith temperature is calculated in two ways. First, the ratio of\nfor EEL and VCSEL is assumed\nto be the same as the ratio [22]. 0.34\nmeV K for the EEL and is calculated for the\nVCSEL as 0.079 meV K . Second, is physically deter-\nmined by the effective cavity length and this changes due to the\ntemperature dependence of the refractive index of the cavity\nand the material thermal expansion coefficient. The values for\nGaAs which constitutes a large part of the cavity have been\nassumed from the bulk values with 3 10 K [23]\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Temperature dependence of both E (calculated) for the VCSEL\ndetermined by the cavity-mode temperature dependence and E (measured)\nfor the EEL which lases close to the peak-gain energy. As the VCSEL is tuned\nwith the gain peak on the high-energy side of the cavity mode at RTP, increasing\ntemperature results in a tuning effect shown by converging E for EEL and\nVCSEL devices. Ideal gain-cavity alignment is predicted at \u0018350 K.\nFig. 6. Temperature dependence of I for VCSEL and EEL. At low\ntemperature, there is only a small increase in I for the EEL due to\nradiative and monomolecular recombination. However, above 250 K\nAuger recombination starts to become significant and above RT there is a\nsuper-exponential increase in I . For the VCSEL at low temperatures I is\nhigh as the device is detuned. Increasing temperature improves gain-cavity\nalignment leading to a minimum I at \u0018280 K. Further increase shows the\ntemperature dependence of the VCSEL becomes similar to that of the EEL\nbeing dominated by Auger even though gain-cavity alignment is improving.\nand the linear thermal expansion coefficient 5.97 10 K\n[24], resulting in a slightly higher value for the VCSEL of\n0.085 meV K . Using the latter calculated\ntuning rate and assuming that the EEL approximates to the\nof the VCSEL active region, we estimate that the VCSEL\nwill attain ideal gain cavity alignment at a temperature of 350\nK (shown in Fig. 5).\nFig. 6 shows the temperature dependence of for the\nGaInNAs EEL and VCSEL normalized (at crossover 350 K).\nFor the EEL at low temperatures is made up of monomolec-\nular and radiative recombination [20]. From 250 K and above\nAuger starts to increase leading to a super-exponential increase\nin at 350 K and above. For the VCSEL, decreases from\n180 K as the gain-cavity alignment of the device improves,\nreaching a minimum at 280 K. However, at RT and above,\nthe tuning effect becomes less significant as the gain spectrum\nbroadens and Auger recombination starts to dominate. Hence,\nFig. 7.

It should be noted that this VCSEL does show a wide\ntemperature operating range of 200 K and also that is\ncomparatively temperature insensitive in the region 250\u2013350\nK, which is the likely operating temperature range.

This accounts for the bandgap reduction due to\nan anti-crossing interaction between the conduction band edge\nand a higher lying nitrogen resonant band and the modified con-\nduction band dispersion. The parameters used reproduce ex-\ncellently the ground and excited state transition energies de-\nduced from photomodulated reflectance spectroscopy measure-\nments on GaInNAs\u2013GaAs QW structures [26]. Fig. 8 shows\ngain spectra generated by the model at room temperature and\npressure for GaInNAs (36%-In 2%-N) incorporating 2.1% com-\npressive strain and a Lorentzian broadening parameter of 17.5\nmeV which has been estimated from spontaneous emission ex-\nperiments [20].\nFig. 8 also shows the cavity mode energy 0.948 eV\nmeasured at room temperature and pressure together with the\nexperimentally determined pressure dependence. In order\nto estimate the threshold gain of the VCSEL, the initial threshold\ncurrent density and subsequently also the threshold carrier sheet\ndensity , at and room temperature is estimated\nby dividing the threshold current by the aperture area, where\nthe aperture diameter is 10 m (including 1 m added to\nthe aperture edge to account for current spreading [27]). The\nthreshold current is then converted to a threshold carrier sheet\ndensity using the equation\n(1)\nwhere is the pumped volume of the active region and is\nthe electronic charge. is the monomolecular recombination\ncoefficient (recombination through defect centres), is the\nbimolecular direct radiative recombination coefficient, and\nthe Auger three-carrier recombination coefficient.

Comparison of measured and calculated I pressure dependence.\nbarrier band offset ( 200 meV [26]): it should be noted that\nthe existence of carrier leakage processes in GaInNAs\u2013GaAs\nQWs could potentially lead to an overestimation of the Auger\nrecombination rate but based upon calculations in [28] leakage\ndoes appear to be negligible up to 400 K. The RT values used\nhere are 1 10 s , 1 10 cm s , and\n4 10 cm s taken from temperature-dependent\nspontaneous emission measurements on similar 1.29- m\nemitting EEL devices made by Fehse et al.

The\nthreshold gain has then been fixed on the gain spectrum at the\nintersection of the and the threshold carrier density\nat 825 cm .\nIn order to model the pressure dependence we have as-\nsumed that over the pressure range considered (0.3 GPa) both\nthe gain spectrum and the recombination coefficients remain\nconstant.

Comparison of measured and calculated I temperature dependence.\nA similar procedure is carried out for the modeled tem-\nperature except that the gain spectra are generated for each tem-\nperature and the calculated cavity mode lasing energy temper-\nature dependence of 0.085 meV K is used.\nThe values are calculated as before but employing the tem-\nperature-dependent recombination coefficients values from [20]\nin (1). We have assumed that the threshold gain is constant over\nthe temperature range. Fig. 11 shows a good fit of the calculated\ndata to the measured temperature dependence. The small di-\nvergence at low temperature between the modeled and measured\ndata may be explained by the fact that the gain model does not\ninclude many body effects (in contrast to [29]). At high carrier\ndensities, the charges screen the atomic attractive force leading\nto an increase in the nearest neighbor electron overlap. This has\nthe overall effect of \u201cbandgap shrinkage,\u201d which reduces the ef-\nfective gain peak rate with increasing current density\nand decreases detuning leading to a slightly higher calculated\n[30].\nVI. CONCLUSION\nWe have measured the temperature and pressure dependence\nof the threshold current of 1.3- m emitting GaInNAs VCSELs\nand of EELs employing the same active regions. We have then\nused a theoretical model based on a realistic 10-band k.P Hamil-\ntonian and the experimentally determined recombination coef-\nficients from EELs to calculate the VCSEL threshold current\npressure and temperature dependence. The results show a good\nagreement between the model and the experimental data and\nsupport the validity of both the recombination rate parameters\nand the model. It also shows that the VCSELs operate over\na wide temperature range making them promising devices for\ncommunication applications.\nREFERENCES\n[1] P. Salet, F. Gaborit, P. Pagnod-Rossiaux, A.
