INTRODUCTION\nThe Skyrme model has enjoyed a lot of interest ever\nsince it was realized that, although it is a nonlinear theory\nof pions, it is also an effective theory of low-energy nu-\ncleon interactions. In fact, it may also provide a new\napproach to nuclear physics; as the lowest states of the\nmodel, corresponding to higher baryon numbers, are ex-\npected to provide a classical description of nuclei. In the\nSkyrme model approach the baryon number is identified\nwith the soliton number.\nMulti-Skyrmions are the stationary points of the static\nenergy functional which, in natural units of the model,\n3\u00012F\u0001=e, is given by\nE \u0001 1\n12\u00012\nZ\nR3\n\u0001\n\u0002 1\n2\nTr\u0003@iUU\u00021\u00042\n\u0005 1\n16\nTr\u0006@iUU\u00021; @jUU\u00021\u00072\n\u0002\nd3 ~x; (1)\nwhere U\u0003 ~x\u0004 2 SU\u00032\u0004 and x is in units of 2=\u0003F\u0001e\u0004.\nMost of the phenomenological applications of the\nSkyrme model, especially to the study of the nucleon or\nhyperon properties, included also the pion (or kaon, or\nD-meson) mass term in the Lagrangian chosen in the\nsimplest possible form (see e.g. Adkins and Nappi [1]).\nIn particular, the kaon mass term has to be added to\ndescribe the mass splittings within the SU\u00033\u0004 multiplets\nof baryons: octet, decuplet, antidecuplet, etc. [2]. However,\nthe role of the mass terms in multi-Skyrmion configura-\ntions, especially at large baryon numbers, has not been\ninvestigated in much detail; the theoretical work performed\nso far has involved mostly the Skyrme model in which\npions are massless (i.e. given by the Lagrangian above). It\nis only very recently that some attention has been paid also\nto the effects associated with the pion mass for large B\nconfigurations [3,4]; one of the effects being the exponen-\ntial localization of multi-Skyrmions. In particular, it was\nstressed that the contribution of the mass term can change\nthe binding properties of large B classical configurations\nand, in particular, their decay properties into configurations\nwith smaller B-numbers [4].\nIn most of these approaches the pion mass term has been\nintroduced via the addition to (1) of the following term:\n1\n12\u00012\nZ\nR3\nm2 Tr\u00031\u0002U\u0004d3 ~x; (2)\nwhere m is related to physical pion mass \u0002\u0001 \u2019 138 MeV\nby the relation m \u0001 2\u0002\u0001=\u0003F\u0001e\u0004, where F\u0001 \u2019 186 MeV is\nthe pion decay constant, taken usually from the experi-\nment, and e is the Skyrme constant.1 The appearance of the\nmass term in effective field theories was discussed, e.g. in\n[6]. Although the effects associated with the pion mass are\nsmall for small values of this mass, they increase if either\nthe baryon number or the pion mass are larger. For mass-\nless pions all the known minimal energy multi-Skyrmion\nconfigurations have a shell-like structure. These field con-\nfigurations were obtained in both numerical simulations\nand in studies involving the so-called \u2018\u2018rational map an-\nsatz.\u2019\u2019 In the rational map ansatz, one approximates the full\nmulti-Skyrmion field by assuming that its angular depen-\ndence is approximately described by a rational map be-\ntween Riemann spheres. This approximation was, first of\nall, shown to be very good in a theory with massless pions\n*Electronic address: kopelio@al20.inr.troitsk.ru\n\u2020Electronic address: b.m.a.g.piette@durham.ac.uk\n\u2021Electronic address: w.j.zakrzewski@durham.ac.uk\n1In [1], the masses of the nucleon and the \u0001\u00031232\u0004 isobar were\nfitted using an SU\u00032\u0004 quantization procedure and, as a result, the\nauthors obtained F\u0001 \u0001 108 MeV, e \u0001 4:84, but these values did\nnot allow one to describe the mass splittings within SU\u00033\u0004\nmultiplets of baryons. The approach of [1] has been revised\nand another set of parameters is widely accepted now. The\nbaryon mass splittings are described with the experimental\nvalues of F\u0001, FK and e \u2019 4:1. For these parameters the absolute\nvalues of the baryon masses are not fitted because they are\ncontrolled by the loop corrections, or the so-called Casimir\nenergy which, for the baryon number 1, was estimated in [5].\nPHYSICAL REVIEW D 73, 014006 (2006)\n1550-7998=2006=73(1)=014006(15)$23.00 014006-1 \u00a9 2006 The American Physical Society\nand it was later extended also to massive pions\u2014where the\nagreement was again shown to be quite good.\nGiven these observations it is extremely important to\nhave the right (correct) mass term. The problem, however,\nis that the mass term is nonunique and the expression (2) is\nonly one of many that can be used. Indeed, the origin of the\nchiral symmetry conserving and chiral symmetry breaking,\nor the mass terms considered2 in [6], may be very different\nin nature. Possible modifications of the mass term had been\nconsidered in [7], where consequences of these modifica-\ntions were studied, for the case of baryon number B \u0001 1.\nHere we have decided to reexamine this issue further and to\nlook at mass terms other than (2), and to see what effects\nthey have on the properties of multi-Skyrmion configura-\ntions with large values of B.\nInitially introduced as a model to describe nucleons\nfrom pion fields, the Skyrme model has since then been\nshown [8] to be an effective theory for the low-energy\nregime of QCD. In that context one can view the Skyrme\nmodel as an effective theory to describe nucleons and try to\nmodify the model to better fit experimental data. The\naddition of the standard mass term complements this pic-\nture and the introduction of a generalized mass term, as we\ndo in the paper, constitutes a natural generalization of the\nSkyrme model. We would like to point out at this stage that\nthe usual mass term not only gives the pion fields a mass,\nbut it also introduces some extra interactions between the\npions. This is obvious when one describes the Skyrme\nmodel using the S4 valued pion field ~\u0003 \u0001 \u0003\u0004;\u00011; \u00012; \u00013\u0004\nwhere \u00011, \u00012 and \u00013 are the pion fields, \u0004 is an auxiliary\nfield, and j ~\u0003j2 \u0001 1. In that formulation, the standard mass\nterm reads, up to an overall constant, VM \u0001 1\u0002 \u0004 \u0001 1\u0002\n\u00031\u0002 \u000121 \u0005 \u000122 \u0005 \u000123\u00041=2, while the generalized mass term\nis given, up to an overall constant, by VMg \u0001 1\u0002 \u0004p when\np \u0001 2 or VMg \u0001 \u000121 \u0005 \u000122 \u0005 \u000123 (see next section). From a\npion point of view, this mass term thus looks definitely\nmore natural than the usual one [though the case of p \b 1\nmight be more suitable for the phenomenological descrip-\ntion of mass splittings within SU\u00033\u0004 multiplets of baryons]\nand it is certainly worth studying the differences between\nthese different models.\nAlthough we present our discussion in terms of mesons\nand baryons, the results we have obtained may be of more\ngeneral interest and can be applied not only for \u00033\u0005\n1\u0004-dimensional, but also for \u00032\u0005 1\u0004-dimensional models.\nIt is quite general and a first priority problem for any kind\nof soliton models to find configurations of lowest energy.\nSince the modified mass term discussed here can lead to a\nconsiderable decrease or increase of the classical configu-\nrations energy, depending on the type of mass term one\nchooses, especially for large topological (baryon) numbers,\nthey could find applications in different fields of physics,\nincluding condensed matter physics, astrophysics and cos-\nmology. At the same time, the Skyrme model has received\na lot of attention from a purely mathematical point of view\n[9], and our modified model has several properties that are\ndefinitely worth studying in detail.\nIn the particular case of baryons or nuclei, some restric-\ntions on the possible form of the mass term may follow\nfrom the existing and nonexisting data on multipion inter-\nactions and also from symmetry considerations of effective\nchiral Lagrangians. This point is discussed in the next\nsection where we discuss various choices of the mass\nterm, pointing out what is fixed and what can be changed.\nIn the following sections we look at some simple examples\nof such mass terms. Expressions for the static energy of\nSkyrmions and some definitions necessary for the descrip-\ntion of multi-Skyrmion within the rational map approxi-\nmation are presented in Secs. III and IV. Our numerical\nresults are presented in Sec. Vand the analytical discussion\nuseful to establish asymptotic behavior is presented in\nSec. VI. We finish with a short section discussing our\nconclusions and ideas for further work.\nII. MASS TERMS\nTo consider the mass term, we first note that the pion\nfields ~\u0001 \u0001 \u0003\u00011; \u00012; \u00013\u0004 are given by U \u0001 \u0004\u0005 i ~\u0001 \t ~\u0005,\nwhere ~\u0005 denotes the triplet of Pauli matrices and \u0004 is\ndetermined by the constraint \u00042 \u0005 ~\u0001 \t ~\u0001 \u0001 1.\nThen the square of the pion mass is the coefficient of the\nexpansion of the mass term in powers of ~\u0001 \t ~\u0001; in fact it is\nthe coefficient of the lowest term, i.e. ~\u0001 \t ~\u0001, in this expan-\nsion. In the case above we have\nm2 Tr\u00031\u0002U\u0004 \u0001 m22\u00031\u0002 \u0004\u0004 \nm2 ~\u0001 \t ~\u0001\u0005 \t \t \t ; (3)\nwhere \u0005\t \t \t stands for further powers of ~\u0001 \t ~\u0001 to be\ninterpreted as pion interaction terms shortly discussed\nbelow. So the mass of the pion field is proportional to m,\nsince the canonical mass term in the Lagrangian is\u0002\u00022\u0001 ~\u0001 \t\n~\u0001=2.\nHowever, (2) is not the only term we can use as the pion\nmass term. It is clear that we can multiply \u00031\u0002U\u0004 in (2) by\nany function of U which in the limit U ! 1 reduces to 1.\nThus we could multiply it by, say, \u0003U\u00051\u00042 .\nIn fact, a little thought shows that, instead ofU in (2), we\ncan take Z 1\n\u00021\ng\u0003p\u0004Updp (4)\nwhereZ 1\n\u00021\ng\u0003p\u0004dp \u0001 1 and\nZ 1\n\u00021\ng\u0003p\u0004p2dp \u0001 1: (5)\nThe usual choice then corresponds to\ng\u0003p\u0004 \u0001 \u0006\u0003p\u0002 1\u0004: (6)\n2We were not initially aware of this work and we thank\nMarleau for bringing [7] to our attention.\nKOPELIOVICH, PIETTE, AND ZAKRZEWSKI PHYSICAL REVIEW D 73, 014006 (2006)\n014006-2\nAs the second condition in (5) can be eliminated by\nredefining the coefficient m2 in (2), we see that a more\ngeneral mass term is given by\n1\n12\u00012\nAm2\nZ\nR3\nTr\n\u0003\n1\u0002\nZ 1\n\u00021\ng\u0003p\u0004Updp\n\u0004\nd3 ~x; (7)\nwhere\nA\u00021 \u0001\nZ 1\n\u00021\ng\u0003p\u0004p2dp: (8)\nFor a single integer value of p, A \u0001 1=p2, and the mass\nterm takes the simple form\nEM \u0001 m\n2\n12\u00012p2\nZ\nR3\nTr\u00061\u0002Up\u0007d3 ~x: (9)\nIn fact, it is the simplest and natural modification of the\nmass term which does not change the value of meson mass.\nWhen we consider applications of our model to elementary\nparticle physics, then certain restrictions on the possible\nforms of the mass term can follow from the data on multi-\npion interactions. Indeed, when the chiral field is small,\nand this corresponds to the case of large distances from the\ncenter of the soliton, then the expansion of the matrixUp in\n(9) in powers of ~\u00012 can be made leading to the Lagrangian\ndensity\nLM \u0001 \u0002 m\n2\n12\u00012\n\u0003\n~\u00012 \u0002 p\n2\n12\n~\u00014 \u0005 p\n4\n360\n~\u00016 \u0002 \t \t \t\n\u0004\n: (10)\nHere we have made the substitution f2 ! ~\u00012, introducing\nthe quantized pion field, to obtain pion contributions to\namplitudes of various physical processes (some numerical\ncoefficients still have to be inserted but their values are not\nessential for the qualitative discussion here). The second\nterm in this expansion, proportional to p2 ~\u00014, gives a con-\ntribution to the low-energy pion-pion scattering amplitude,\nusually extracted from the data on the reactions involving\nthe two-pion production on nucleons, \u0001N ! 2\u0001N [10], or\nfrom heavy meson decays to final states containing two or\nmore pions, see e.g. [11]. The next term, proportional to\np4 ~\u00016, gives a contribution to e.g. the process 2\u0001! 4\u0001,\nwhich could be studied in a similar reaction, e.g. \u0001N !\n4\u0001N, etc. The data on the pion-pion scattering are known\nnot to be in contradiction with the usual value p \u0001 1,\nalthough they have a considerable uncertainty, see e.g.\n[12] and references therein. The data on the reactions\n2\u0001! 4\u0001 or 2\u0001! 6\u0001 do not seem to be available yet.\nA phenomenological analysis of the existing data aimed at\nproviding restrictions on possible values of the power p\nwould be of interest, although it is behind the scope of the\npresent paper. Anyway, it is clear that the power p cannot\nbe arbitrarily large to fit the data on multipion interactions.\nAnother class of restrictions can follow from the invari-\nance properties imposed on the modified mass term. It is\nwell known that the Lagrangian of the model depending on\nthe chiral derivatives (1) is invariant under chiral trans-\nformations, left L or right R: U ! LURy with L 2 SU\u00032\u0004\nand R 2 SU\u00032\u0004 being arbitrary constant unitary matrices,\nsee e.g. [1,6] and references therein. The mass term, in\ngeneral, violates this invariance, but is invariant under such\na transformation when L \u0001 R.\nIn the particle physics context, the mass term of the\nunderlying QCD Lagrangian\nLM \n \u0002 RM L \u0005 \u0002 LMy R (11)\nis invariant under simultaneous transformations  L !\nL L,  R ! R R and M! LMRy, see e.g. [7].\nAccording to this, the mass term in the Lagrangian density\nof the chiral soliton model, which can be written as\nLM \n Tr\u0003MU\u0005UyMy \u0002MU0 \u0002Uy0My\u0004; (12)\nis invariant under the transformation U ! LURy, M !\nRMLy, which we may call the UM transformation; here\nthe meson mass matrix M\nM.\nThe commonly made assumption in particle physics\n[1,13] is that after such a transformation the vacuum value\nof the matrix U can be made equal to the unit matrix, U0 \u0001\n1. Simultaneously, the mass matrix M takes a diagonal\nform and is proportional to the unit matrix Mdiag \n\n\u00022 diag\u00031; 1\u0004, since, phenomenologically, we can neglect\nthe isospin violation in the mass matrix (i.e. the difference\nof masses of u and d quarks, or \u0001\u000b and \u00010 mesons).\nIn our case of the generalized mass term we also assume\nthat it can be written in an analogous way:\nLM \n Tr\u0006\u0003MpU\u0004p \u0005 \u0003UyMyp\u0004p \u0002 \u0003MpU0\u0004p \u0002 \u0003Uy0Myp\u0004p\u0007\n(13)\nand so is invariant under the transformations U ! LURy,\nMp ! RMpLy. Clearly, the terms like (13) with p \u0001\n2; 3 . . . do arise when we consider second, third,\netc. order contributions in the quark masses or meson\nmasses squared; in this caseMp \nM. For pions such terms\nare expected to be very small, but they become important\nfor heavier quarks\/mesons\u2014the case we are studying here.\nMore interesting is a possibility to have the terms (13) in\nthe lowest order in the quark\/meson masses; i.e. instead of\nthe usual mass term with p \u0001 1, as we discussed above. In\nthis case, by dimensional arguments, \u0003Mp\u0004p \nM. After an\nappropriate transformation we have U0 \u0001 1, Mdiagp \n\ndiag\u00031; 1\u0004, with the relation \u0003Mdiagp \u0004p \u0001 Mdiag, and we\nobtain\nLM \n Tr\u0003Mdiagp \u0004p\u0006Up \u0005 \u0003Uy\u0004p \u0002 2\u0007\n\u0001 2TrMdiag\u0003Up \u0002 1\u0004; (14)\nand so we see that the mass term takes the form (9).\nIt would be important to determine the form of the mass\nterm from the underlying QCD Lagrangian, or to show that\n(9) is possible, at least for some values of power p. Strictly\nspeaking, this is an unresolved problem, which deserves\nMASS TERMS IN THE SKYRME MODEL PHYSICAL REVIEW D 73, 014006 (2006)\n014006-3\nfurther study. In this context we can mention here the\nrecent work of Battye, Krusch and Sutcliffe [14], who\nmodified the model by changing its potential term, in\nanalogy to our modifications of the potential term. Of\ncourse, in concrete physical applications one should con-\nsider also the Casimir energy contribution related to loop\ncorrections, but one can look at their work as a study of a\nclassical problem.\nIn this paper we shall consider several reasonable values\nof the parameter p, and study its effects, in spite of possible\nrestrictions on its range in particle physics applications,\nbearing in mind applications in wider classes of models,\nnot only connected to QCD or to effective chiral\nLagrangians. One particular case of interest has already\nbeen studied in the so-called \u00032\u0005 1\u0004-dimensional \u2018\u2018new\nbaby Skyrme model\u2019\u2019 [15\u201317] describing anisotropic sys-\ntems, where the mass term corresponds to the value p \u0001 2,\nsee (9). As it was shown in [17], this variant of the model\ncan be especially well approximated analytically.\nIII. B \u0001 1 SKYRMION\nConsider first the case of one Skyrmion. The single\nSkyrmion has the hedgehog form\nU \u0001 exp\u0003if\u0003r\u0004 ~^r \t ~\u0005\u0004; (15)\nwhere ~^r is the unit vector in the ~r direction and f\u0003r\u0004 is the\nradial profile function which is required to satisfy the\nboundary conditions f\u00030\u0004 \u0001 \u0001 and f\u00031\u0004 \u0001 0:\nPutting (15) into the energy functional we find that the\nenergy of the field is given by\nE \u0001 1\n3\u0001\nZ 1\n0\n\u0005\nr2 _f2 \u0005 2\u0003 _f2 \u0005 1\u0004sin2f\u0005 sin\n4f\nr2\n\u0005 2Am2r2\n\u0003\n1\u0002\nZ 1\n\u00021\ng\u0003k\u0004 cos\u0003kf\u0004dk\n\u0004\u0006\ndr; (16)\nwhere A is given by (8).\nThus, for the minimal field, f\u0003r\u0004 satisfies the equation\n\u0003f\u0006r2 \u0005 2sin2f\u0007 \u0005 2r _f\u0005 2\u0003 _f2 \u0002 1\u0004 sinf cosf\n\u0002 2sin\n3f cosf\nr2\n\u0002m2r2\nR1\n\u00021 g\u0003k\u0004 sin\u0003kf\u0004kdkR1\n\u00021 g\u0003k\u0004k2dk\n\u0001 0: (17)\nWe have investigated several classes of such functions:\n(i) g\u0003k\u0004 \u0001 \u0006\u0003k\u0002 p\u0004 for several values of p.\nThe cases of even or odd integer values for p have\nalso been investigated analytically. Moreover, it is\neasy to notice that the mass term for p > 1 is\nsmaller than that for p \u0001 1, since \u00031\u0002\ncos\u0003pf\u0004\u0004=p2 \u0001 2sin2\u0003pf=2\u0004=p2 and\nsin2\u0003pf=2\u0004=p2 < sin2\u0003f=2\u0004 for p > 1.\n(ii) g given by a Gaussian centered around p \u0001 1, or\naround p \u0001 0.\nIn the latter two cases we have taken\ng\u0003p\u0004 \u0001\n\u0007\u0007\u0007\n\u0007\np\u0007\u0007\u0007\u0007\n\u0001\np exp\u0003\u0002\u0007\u0003p\u0002 1\u00042\u0004 and\ng\u0003p\u0004 \u0001\n\u0007\u0007\u0007\n\u0007\np\u0007\u0007\u0007\u0007\n\u0001\np exp\u0003\u0002\u0007p2\u0004:\n(18)\nThe corresponding expressions for the energy are\ngiven by (for the case with p \u0001 1)\nE \u0001 1\n3\u0001\nZ 1\n0\n\u0001\nr2 _f2 \u0005 2\u0003 _f2 \u0005 1\u0004sin2f\u0005 sin\n4f\nr2\n\u0005 2m2r2 12\u0007\u0007\u0007\u0007\u0007\n\u0001\u0007\np \u0005 1\u0005 12\u0007\n\f\n\u0003\n1\u0002 cosf exp\n\u0005\n\u0002 f\n2\n4\u0007\n\u0006\u0004\u0002\ndr; (19)\nwith a similarly looking expression for the other\ncase.\nIV. MULTI-SKYRMIONS\nFor multi-Skyrmion fields we use the rational map an-\nsatz of Houghton et al. [18]. The ansatz involves the\nintroduction of the spherical coordinates in R3, so that a\npoint x 2 R3 is given by a pair \u0003r; \b\u0004, where r \u0001 jxj is the\ndistance from the origin, and \b is a Riemann sphere\ncoordinate giving the point on the unit two-sphere which\nintersects the half line through the origin and the point x,\ni.e., \b \u0001 tan\u0003\t2\u0004ei\u2019, where \t and \u2019 are the usual spherical\ncoordinates on the unit sphere.\nThen one observes [19] that a general SU\u00032\u0004 matrix, U,\ncan always be written in the form\nU \u0001 exp\u0003if\u00032P\u0002 I\u0004\u0004 (20)\nwhere f is real and P is a 2\f 2 Hermitian projector i.e.,\nP \u0001 P2 \u0001 Py. The rational map ansatz assumes that the\nSkyrme field has the above form and, in addition, that f\ndepends only on the radial coordinate, i.e., f \u0001 f\u0003r\u0004, and\nthat the projector depends only on the angular coordinates,\ni.e., P\u0003\b; \u0002\b\u0004:\nThe projector is then taken in the form\nP \u0001 f \r f\ny\njfj2 (21)\nwhere f\u0003\b\u0004 is a 2-component vector, each entry of which is\na degree k polynomial in \b: Incidentally, given the projec-\ntive nature of f, one can also use the parametrization f \u0001\n\u00031; R\u0004t, where R\u0003\b\u0004 is the ratio of R \u0001 f1=f2.\nFor B \u0001 1 this ansatz reproduces the one Skyrmion field\nconfiguration discussed in the last section, while for B> 1\nthe ansatz (20) is not compatible with the equations which\ncome from (1), so the ansatz cannot produce any exact\nmulti-Skyrmion configurations. However, as was shown in\nmany papers, see e.g. [18,20], it gives approximate field\nconfigurations which turn out to be very close to the\nKOPELIOVICH, PIETTE, AND ZAKRZEWSKI PHYSICAL REVIEW D 73, 014006 (2006)\n014006-4\nnumerically computed minimal energy states. To do this,\none selects a specific map f and puts it into the Skyrme\nenergy functional (1). Performing the integration over the\nangular coordinates results in a one-dimensional energy\nfunctional for f\u0003r\u0004 which has then to be solved\nnumerically.\nHence, if we write f \u0001 \u00031; R\u0004t, then the Skyrme energy is\nE \u0001 1\n3\u0001\nZ \u0005\nr2f02 \u0005 2B\u0003f02 \u0005 1\u0004sin2f\u0005 I sin\n4f\nr2\n\u0005 2Am2r2\n\u0003\n1\u0002\nZ 1\n\u00021\ng\u0003k\u0004 cos\u0003kf\u0004dk\n\u0004\u0006\ndr; (22)\nwhere I denotes the integral\nI \u0001 1\n4\u0001\nZ \u00051\u0005 j\bj2\n1\u0005 jRj2\n\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\bdRd\b\n\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\n\u0006\n4 2id\bd \u0002\b\n\u00031\u0005 j\bj2\u00042 : (23)\nThe values of I have already been calculated; in what\nfollows we take our values from [20]. The equation for\nthe profile function f is very similar to the equation (17) of\nthe last section except that the coefficients of terms involv-\ning sinf cosf are multiplied by B in the first term and I in\nthe second.\nV. NUMERICAL RESULTS\nWe have looked at the values of various quantities for\ndifferent choices of p [taking g\u0003k\u0004 \u0001 \u0006\u0003k\u0002 p\u0004], and also at\nsome Gaussians. The Gaussian cases were not particularly\nilluminating so here we discuss only the cases of fixed\nvalues of p.\nNote that when p! 0 we have a nontrivial contribution\nof the mass term. This involves taking the limit p! 0 of\nthe expression in (22) and then its last line becomes\nm2r2f2. We can also consider the limit whenm! 0 which\ncorresponds to the massless Skyrme model.\nWe present our numerical results in Figs. 1\u20133 in which\nwe plot the normalized energy\nEn \u0001 E\u0003B\u0004\nBE\u00031\u0004 (24)\nand the shell radius, as a function of B, for several values of\nthe mass3 and for p from 0 to 5.\nThe normalized energy (24) is a dimensionless energy\nwhich describes the binding of the configuration by com-\nparing it to that of the B \u0001 1 solution. Note that when\nEn > 1 the B multi-Skyrmion configuration has an energy\nlarger than the energy of B single Skyrmions thus showing\nthat this configuration is unstable. The jagged curve near\nthe origin is caused by the value of I which varies a lot\nwhen B is small. When B> 22, we have taken I \u0001 1:28B2\n(see [20]) and so the curves are smooth.\nWe also present the radius of the solutions defined as\nfollows:\nR \u0001\nR\nrE\u0003r\u0004r2drR\nE\u0003r\u0004r2dr ; (25)\nwhere E\u0003r\u0004 is the radial energy density.\nLooking at the figures we see that, as B gets very large,\nthe normalized energy converges to a finite value when p is\neven, but that it slowly diverges when p is odd. This was\nalso observed by Battye and Sutcliffe [4] in the case of p \u0001\n1. When m \u0001 4:131 (Fig. 1) the curve for p \u0001 3 crosses\nthe value of En \u0001 1 at B \u000e 365. For a smaller value of m,\nthe curves cross this bound state threshold for much larger\nvalues of B. This is not surprising, as for odd p the mass\nterm adds a nonvanishing contribution to the energy den-\nsity from the region where f \u0001 \u0001 and so to make a large\nshell configuration one needs to put an increasing amount\nof energy inside the shell. When B is large, this becomes\nenergetically too expensive and the configuration is not a\nbound state anymore.\np = 1\np = 2\np = 3\np = 4\np = 5\np = 0\nE\nn\n0.8\n0.9\n1\n1.1\n1.2\n1.3\nB\n100 200 300 400 500\np = 1\np = 2\np = 3\np = 4\np = 5\np = 0\nR\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\nB\n100 200 300 400 500\na\nb\nFIG. 1.

On the other hand, for fixed values\nof p and B, the radius decreases when the mass m in-\ncreases. This is exactly what one expects for odd values of\np as the energy density inside the shell is nonzero, but it is\nalso true for even p, i.e. the radius of the shell decreases\nwith the increase of the mass.\nOne property worth investigating for these low-energy\nconfigurations is their ability to decay into two or more\nshells of smaller baryon charges. To do this we have\ncomputed the derivative of the energy with respect to B\nand compared the obtained values with the energy per\nbaryon of some small B configurations of low energy\n(typically B \u0001 2, B \u0001 4, B \u0001 7 and B \u0001 17). When the\nvalue of the derivative is larger than the energy per baryon\nof other configurations, it implies that the larger configu-\nration can decay into two shells.

APPROXIMATE ANALYTICAL TREATMENT\nIt was shown in [3] that many properties of multi-\nSkyrmions, including their classical mass, spatial distribu-\ntion, moments of inertia, etc., can be described with a good\naccuracy using a relatively simple power step (or \u2018\u2018in-\nclined\u2019\u2019 step) approximation of the profile function. A\nsimilar approach was also used successfully to describe\n\u2018\u2018baby\u2019\u2019-Skyrmions in the 2\u0005 1 dimensional Skyrme\nmodel [15\u201317,21]. This approximation also turns out to\nbe useful for the study of the asymptotics of our massive\nmulti-Skyrmion field configurations for large values of the\nbaryon number B.\nLet us consider first the large r asymptotics of the profile\nfunction. Clearly, this asymptotic behavior is governed by\nthe second derivative term and the mass term in the\nLagrangian. The Euler-Lagrange equation then becomes\nasymptotically\n\u0003r2f0\u00040 \u0001 \u00032B\u0005m2r2\u0004f; (26)\nand so, if m2r2 \u0010 2B, we have 2rf0 \u0005 r2f00 \u0001 m2r2f,\nwhich has the asymptotics f\n exp\u0003\u0002mr\u0004.\nFor the values of B in the region of r where m2r2 < 2B,\nthe profile f has a power behavior, and it is in this region\nthat most of the mass and most of the baryon density of the\nmulti-Skyrmion is concentrated [3], while the exponential\ntail of the profile function gives only a small correction to\nall such quantities and so can be neglected. Thus if we can\nneglect the \nm2 term on the right side of (26), we obtain\nthe power law f\n r\u0002\n\u0007\u0007\u0007\u0007\n2B\np\n. As we shall see, the dominant\nrange of r is always such that we can make this approxi-\nmation, at least for pions and kaons.\nDenoting \u0003 \u0001 cosf and taking for g\u0003k\u0004 \u0001 \u0006\u0003k\u0002 p\u0004\nwhere p is an integer, the energy of the multi-Skyrmion\ncan be written as\nM \u0001 1\n3\u0001\nZ \u0001 1\n\u00031\u0002\u00032\u0004 \u0006r\n2\u000302 \u0005 2B\u00031\u0002\u00032\u00042\u0007 \u0005\n\u0003\n2B\u000302\n\u0005 I \u00031\u0002\u0003\n2\u00042\nr2\n\u0004\n\u0005 2m2\u0004p\u0003\u0003\u0004r2\n\u0002\ndr; (27)\nwith \u0003 changing from \u00021 at r \u0001 0 to 1 at r! 1. The first\npart of (27) is the second order term contribution while the\nsecond term is due to the Skyrme term. Note that at fixed\nr \u0001 r0 the fourth order term is exactly proportional to a\none-dimensional domain wall energy widely discussed in\nthe literature, see e.g. [22]. The function \u0004p\u0003\u0003\u0004 \u0001 \u00031\u0002\ncos\u0003pf\u0004\u0004=p2 can be written explicitly for each p: \u00041 \u0001\n1\u0002\u0003, \u00043 \u0001 \u00031\u0002\u0003\u0004\u00031\u0005 2\u0003\u00042=9 \b \u00041, \u00042 \u0001\n\u00031\u0002\u00032\u0004=2 \b \u00041, \u00044 \u0001 \u00032\u00031\u0002\u00032\u0004=2 \b \u00042, etc. Also\nit can be shown that \u00043 \b \u00042, \u00044 \b \u00043, and it follows\nimmediately, for any p, that \u00044p \b \u00043p \b \u00042p \b \u0004p,\netc. The functions \u0004p and the whole mass term have\ndifferent properties for odd and even p and so, for this\nreason, these two cases will be considered separately.\nIt is possible to rewrite the second order term contribu-\ntion in (27) as\nM\u00032\u0004 \u0001 1\n3\u0001\nZ \u0001 r2\n\u00031\u0002\u00032\u0004 \u0006\u0003\n0 \u0002 \u0007\u0007\u0007\u0007\u0007\u00072Bp \u00031\u0002\u00032\u0004=r\u00072\n\u0005 2r \u0007\u0007\u0007\u0007\u0007\u00072Bp \u00030\u0002dr; (28)\nand similarly for the fourth order Skyrme term.

Both b and r0\nare arbitrary at this stage; they will be determined later by\nmeans of the mass minimization procedure. Note that the\nradii of distributions of baryon number and of the mass of\nthe multi-Skyrmion are close to r0. Let us point out that our\nparametrization (30) is very accurate as, in the Skyrme\nmodel with the usual mass term, as shown in [3], the\nmasses and other characteristics of multi-Skyrmions are\ndescribed by such a parametrization to within a few\npercent.\nA.

The second\norder term of the initial Lagrangian makes a small contri-\nbution in the large mass regime; thus the Skyrme term and\nthe mass term approximately balance each other, and the\nmass term gives \n1=4 of the total mass, by the Derrick\ntheorem.

This is in agreement with the\nnumerical results presented in the previous section.\nThe radius of the multi-Skyrmion state, to first order in\nthe mass term, can also be rewritten as\nr0 \u2019 r0;m\u00010\n\u0005\n1\u0002 \u00060 3\n\n2\u000b2b\n\u0006\n\u2019 r0;m\u00010\n\u0005\n1\u0002 3\u0001\n4\n\u00060\rB\n\u0006\n: (61)\nSince \u00060 decreases with increasing p, the radius of the\nmulti-Skyrmion increases, in good agreement with the\nnumerical results of the previous section.

Even p; \u2018\u2018the inclined step approximation\u2019\u2019\nA natural question then arises: to what extent the struc-\nture of multi-Skyrmions and their properties depend on the\nparametrization we have used. Of course, we have to\nsatisfy the boundary conditions on the profile function:\nf\u00030\u0004 \u0001 \u0001 and f\u00031\u0004 \u0001 0 and the function should minimize\nthe value of the mass (27). However, the profile f could\nhave been decreasing according to a law which is different\nfrom (30), thus giving us different mass and B-number\ndistributions. But it is just the property of the Lagrangian\n(27) that produces the above-mentioned bubble structure as\nthis structure leads to a low value of the mass. Another,\nperhaps the simplest, example of a description that we can\nmake is provided by the \u2018\u2018toy\u2018\u2018 model of \u2018\u2018the inclined\nstep\u2019\u2019 type [3]. Such an approximation is cruder than \u2018\u2018the\npower step\u2019\u2019 considered previously. However, it has the\nadvantage that the calculations can be made for arbitrary p.\nHence, we shall mention it here and compare its results\nwith what we have obtained before.\nLet W be the width of the step, and r0\u2014the radius of the\nmulti-Skyrmion state, defined by the value of r at which the\nprofile f \u0001 \u0001=2. Then we can approximate the profile\nfunction by f \u0001 \u0001=2\u0002 \u0003r\u0002 ro\u0004\u0001=W for ro \u0002W=2 \b\nr \b ro \u0005W=2.

The case of\np \u0001 1 was considered previously [3], and since the case of\nother odd p is similar, we restrict our attention here to the\ncase of even p\u2019s.\nThus for an arbitrary even p we have\n1\np2\nZ r0\u0005W=2\nr0\u0002W=2\n\u00031\u0002 cos\u0003pf\u0004\u0004r2dr \u0001 r\n2\n0\np2\nW \u0005 W\n3\n12p2\n\u0005 2W\n3\np4\u00012\n:\n(63)\nThe volume term \nr30 is absent, and since W \u0011 r0 at large\nB, we retain the term \nr20W on the right-hand side of (63)\nand omit other terms.

V, and as the\nasymptotic behavior of the solitons mass also is well\nunderstood, (43), (44), and (56), etc.\nVII. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have investigated different possible forms of the\nmass term in the SU\u00032\u0004 Skyrme model, concentrating our\nattention on a class of terms involving a parameter p. We\nhave found that the case of even p, but p \u0001 0, in the\nparametrization of the mass term, \n\u00031\u0002 cos\u0003pf\u0004\u0004=p2 is\nof special interest. In this case the contribution to the static\nmass proportional to the volume of multi-Skyrmion is\nabsent, and the multi-Skyrmion states, at any value of the\nchiral meson mass m in the Lagrangian, are the spherical\nbubbles empty inside, their energy and baryon number\nbeing concentrated on the surface of the bubble. The\nenergy per B-number decreases with increasing B and\napproaches a constant value, which is proportional to\n\u0007\u0007\u0007\u0007\nm\np\nwhen m is large. Thus as B increases the shell configura-\ntions become more bound.\nFor odd values of p and p \u0001 0, there is a volumelike\ncontribution to the static mass of multi-Skyrmions, within\nthe rational map approximation, which grows faster than B.\nThus it is responsible for the asymptotic behavior of the\nmulti-Skyrmion mass \nB9=8 \u0007\u0007\u0007\u0007mp and makes the multi-\nSkyrmions unstable with respect to the decay into\nSkyrmions of smaller values of B. These unbound configu-\nrations have recently been observed by Battye and Sutcliffe\n[4], for p \u0001 1, for relatively low values of B even for the\npion mass. We have also observed them for the other odd\nvalues of p: p \u0001 3 and p \u0001 5. When the mass m is small,\nthe configurations decay is into a B \u0001 17 or B \u0001 7 shell\nonly for very large values of B. As the mass increases, the\ndecay becomes possible for smaller values of B. When p is\neven but non-null, the configuration cannot decay into\nsmaller shells. Thus if we want our states to be bound\nstates we should consider p even, or a combination of\nterms with p even.\nNote that the fact that some rational map configurations\ndo not form classically bound states suggests that the states\nof minimal energy for those values of p and B can be of a\ndifferent form. They might correspond to embedded shells,\nor not have any shell structure at all. This needs to be\ninvestigated further but this can be done only by solving\nthe full equations of the model.\nThe configurations we obtained for p > 1 have lower\nenergy than those considered within the standard mass\nterm and, for this reason, they have a good chance to find\nrealization in nature, not only in elementary particle and\nnuclear physics, but also in astrophysics and cosmology.\nOf course, what really happens for physical nuclei is un-\nclear as our results are classical; i.e., to compare them with\nphysical nuclei we would have had to compute quantum\ncorrections, and this has not yet been done for nonzero\nmodes.\nInvestigations of multi-Skyrmions could be extended\nalso to variants of the model where the higher derivative\nterms (sixth order, eighth order, etc.) are included into the\neffective Lagrangian. The studies performed in [23] for the\ncase of the sixth order term and recently in [24] for some\ngeneralizations of the Skyrme model including an eighth\norder term in the chiral derivatives, have shown that topo-\nlogical structures of minimal energy configurations are the\nsame for these model extensions as in the original variant\nof the model, for values of baryon numbers not too large.\nTherefore, most probably, the observations of bound large\nB states made in the present paper for certain modifications\nof the mass term will be confirmed in such generalizations\nof the model, although this requires detailed studies.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe work of V.
