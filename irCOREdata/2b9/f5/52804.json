In general, it is seen that most polymer \nmaterials possess poor adhesion characteristics and, as a direct result of this, tend to be difficult to wet, \nhaving inferior bond qualities [6]. Numerous researchers have endeavored to surface modify the surface \nof polymers to improve upon the adhesion and wettability characteristics. This has especially been seen \nthroughout biomedical applications in which polymeric biomaterials have adequate bulk properties but \nlack sufficient surface properties in terms of efficient cell response [4,7]. From this, it can be seen that it \nis crucial for polymers that the surfaces are modified in order to enhance the consequent intended use. For \ninstance it was discussed by Milde et al. [8] that, owed to the inert nature of polymer surfaces, numerous \nplastics are unable to be coated with sufficient adhesion highlighting the need for these plastics to have \npretreatment prior to the application. In addition to this, Riyadh et al. [9] found that surface modification \nof polyimide could give rise to improved adhesion characteristics for a thin metal coating which, when \napplied to space applications, can reduce the adhesion for unwanted contaminants. Furthermore, in \nconsideration of wettability and bioactive cell response a number of experiments have been carried out \nwhich has identified that the both of these parameters can be enhanced and modified by means of laser \nsurface patterning [10-13].     \nA number of techniques have been implemented to achieve surface modifications such as surface coatings \n[14], plasma [15] and lithography [16,17]. These techniques offer a number of advantages but can be \ncostly, require high maintenance and also require high user involvement. An alternative method offering \nflexibility, accuracy and negligible bulk modification is that of laser surface patterning. Utilizing lasers in \nthis manner can be seen to a very attractive method for varying surface properties as they also allow for \nrelatively clean processing emphasizing the reduced need for post-processing. In terms of laser beam \ninteractions with materials, the way a material responds to the incident laser is highly dependant upon a \nnumber of parameters. Specific to polymers, IR lasers give rise to resonant coupling in the form of bond \nand lattice vibrations allowing for the processing to be thermolytical. This is due to the fact that the \nphoton is only weakly absorbed by the polymer, with the energy that has been absorbed being distributed \nto vibrational modes [18]. With most lasers it is seen that the smallest possible features that can be \nachieved are on the micron scale; however, nano-structures have been achieved using a laser emitting at a \nwavelength of 157 nm [19]. \nThe study of wettability has been a major focal point for many researchers and has been applied to a wide \nrange of applications such as biomedical [15,20,21], coating technologies [22,23] and adhesion [5,24,25]. \nAs the interface between a solid and liquid can be very complex it is necessary to account for the wetting \nregime that takes place. Two of the most common wetting regimes is that of Wenzel and Cassie-Baxter. \nThe Wenzel regime describes a liquid which, when in contact with a surface, completely wets the surface \n[26,27]; whereas the Cassie-Baxter regime is applied to those systems which give rise to the formation of \nair pockets along the liquid-solid interface [28-30]. However, in some cases it has been seen that it may \nbe possible for a hydrophilic surface to give rise to some form hybrid wetting regime owed to the \nroughness and topographical pattern on the surface [31,32]. In this instance, it is seen in some cases that \nupon increasing the surface roughness, through the patterning of a surface, the contact angle can increase. \nOn another note it has also been observed that in general, when the surface energy and it\u2019s components \nare a dominant factor, the contact angle is an inverse function of the polar component of the surface [4].  \nLeading on from this, it can be seen that it would be advantageous to devise a repeatable technique which \nwould allow material surfaces to be modified in order to optimize that surface for the required \napplication. As lasers offer an attractive means of allowing surfaces to be modified topographically and \nchemically, with negligible effect to the bulk properties, this paper details how the wettability of PMMA \nin terms of the recently advancing contact angle can be modified by implementing CO2 laser induced \npatterns.  \n3.0 \u2013 Experimental Procedure \n3.1 \u2013 Laser Irradiation Procedure \nThe PMMA was sourced in 150\u00d7150 mm sheets with a thickness of 5 mm (Goodfellow Cambridge, Ltd). \nA 1kW continuous wave (cw) CO2 laser (Everlase S48; Coherent, Ltd) was used to obtain a conveniently \nsized PMMA sample for experimentation. That is, the as-received PMMA sheet was cut into 30 mm \ndiameter discs. No discernible heat affected zone (HAZ) was observed under optical microscopic \nexamination.  \nIn order to generate the required marking pattern with the 10.6 \u03bcm Synrad cw 10W CO2 laser system \nSynrad Winmark software version 2.1.0, build 3468 was used. In addition, the software was capable of \nusing images saved as .dxf files which can be produced by using CAD programs such as, in this case, \nLicom AutoCaM. The PMMA samples where placed into the laser system onto a stage and where held in \nplace using a bracket with a 30.5 mm diameter hole cut into the centre of the bracket. The surface of the \nsample was placed at the focus of the laser system which was 250 mm away from the output facet of the \nlaser system. To achieve the required pattern the system utilized a galvanometer scanner to scan the 95 \n\u03bcm spot size beam directly across the stationary target material. It should be noted that the target material \nand laser system was held in a laser safety cabinet in which the ambient gas was air and an extraction \nsystem was used to remove any fumes produced during laser processing.  \nIn all instances, to induce the intended surface pattern the laser parameters were kept constant with the \npower set to 70% (7W) and traverse scanning speed being 600 mms\n-1\n. 4 samples were laser processed in \nwhich the four patterns induced onto the surfaces of the PMMA samples were: trenches with 50 \u03bcm \nspacing (T50), hatch with 50 \u03bcm spacing (H50), trenches with 100 \u03bcm spacing (T100) and hatch with 100 \n\u03bcm spacing (H100). In addition, an as-received control sample was used (AR). It should also be noted \nhere that the dimensions stated for the laser patterned samples are that of the laser scanning dimensions \nand not of the resulting laser-induced pattern.  \n3.2 \u2013 Topography, Wettability Characteristics and Surface Chemistry Analysis \nAfter the laser patterning, the PMMA samples were analysed using an optical microscope (Flash 200 \nSmartscope; OGP, Ltd) to obtain optical micrographs of the samples. Also, surface profiles of the \nsamples were determined using a white light interferometer (WLI) (NewView 500; Zygo, Ltd) with \nMetroPro and TalyMap Gold Software. The Zygo WLI was setup using a \u00d710 Mirau lens with a zoom of \n\u00d70.5 and working distance of 7.6 mm. This system also allowed Sa and Ra roughness parameters to be \ndetermined for each sample. \nIn accordance with the procedure detailed by Rance [33] the samples were ultrasonically cleaned in \nisoproponal (Fisher Scientific Ltd., UK) for 3 minutes at room temperature before using a sessile drop \ndevice (OCA20; Dataphysics Instruments, GmbH) to determine various wettability characteristics. This \nwas to allow for a relatively clean surface prior to any contact angle measurements being taken. To ensure \nthat the sample surfaces were dry a specimen dryer (Metaserv, UK) was utilized to blow ambient air \nacross the samples. To obtain recent advancing and receding contact angles using triply distilled water \nand the recent advancing angles using diodomethane for each sample the sessile drop device was used \nwith relevant software (SCA20; Dataphysics Intrsuments, GmbH). By utilizing the advancing contact \nangles for the two liquids with the software an Owens, Wendt, Rabel and Kaeble (OWRK) plot was \nproduced to determine the surface energy of the samples. For the two reference liquids the SCA20 \nsoftware used the Str\u00f6m et al. technique to calculate the surface energies of the samples. It should be \nnoted here that ten contact angles, using two droplets, in each instance was recorded to achieve a mean \ncontact angle for each liquid and surface.   \nAll samples were sputter coated with Au to attain adequate conductance and analysed using scanning \nelectron microscopy (SEM). In addition, prior to coating for SEM, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy \n(XPS) analysis to allow any surface modifications in terms of chemical composition due to the laser \nirradiation to be revealed.  \n4.0 \u2013 Results and Discussion \n4.1 \u2013 Effect of Laser Irradiation on Topography \nIt has been shown previously that CO2 lasers, such as the Synrad system used in this instance, possess the \nability to significantly surface modify polymers [34]. Throughout this study it has been seen\nthat laser surface modification of PMMA, through employing the Synrad cw CO2 laser, is no exception. \nFor instance, it is evident from the micrographs shown in Figure 1 that the laser induced patterns (see \nFigures 1(b) \u2013 1(e)) gave rise to considerable melting of the surface. This arises due to the fact that the \n10.6 \u03bcm laser beam interaction with the PMMA surface is a thermolytical process owed to the laser \ncoupling into the material in the form of bond and lattice vibrations. Figure 1 also highlights, \nqualitatively, the major differences between induced surface patterns as well as between the as-received \nsample. It can be seen that the trench and hatch patterns with 50 \u03bcm spacing (see Figures 1(b) and (d)) \ngave rise to considerably more melting in comparison to that of the trench and hatch patterns with 100 \u03bcm \nspacing (see Figures 1(c) and (e)). This was a result of the spot size of the laser beam at the surface of the \nmaterial was 95 \u03bcm which gave rise to the pattern overlapping on the 50 \u03bcm spaced samples, causing \nareas to re-melt and re-solidify. It is also necessary to note here that the hatch patterns (H50 and H100) \nshown in Figure 1(d) and (e) appear to have had the topographical hatch more prominent in the y-axis in \ncomparison to the x-axis. This is on account of the way in which the laser interacted with the material as \nthe laser scanned the pattern across the material surface. In order to confirm what was observed through \noptical microscopic analysis the samples were also studied by obtaining SEM images which can be seen \nin Figure 2. \nLike the optical microscopy analysis, SEM analysis of the samples (see Figure 2) showed that the surface \nof the laser patterned PMMA samples had been amply modified in comparison to that of the as-received \nsample. It was also interesting to see that SEM images of the 50 \u03bcm spaced patterns (see Figures 2 (b) and \n(d)) indicated that the intended topographical pattern had been slightly distorted due to the large amount \nof surface melting that appears to have taken place. Furthermore, from Figure 2 (d) it was suggested that \nthe 50 \u03bcm hatch pattern (H50) gave rise to a smoother surface in comparison to the other laser patterned \nsamples which can be accounted to the surface melting and re-melting. Whereas SEM images of the other \nlaser patterned samples (see Figure 2 (a) \u2013 (c) and (e)) imply that, owed to the surface melting and re-\nsolidifying, protrusions away from the surface formed resulting in a considerable increase in surface \nroughness. \nIn order to obtain the roughness parameters quantatively, WLI was employed which allowed for \ncontinuous axonometric images and surface profile extractions to be generated. This allowed a 3-D \nprofile of each of the sample surfaces to be obtained. Figure 3 shows the continuous axonometric image \nwith corresponding profile extraction for the as-received reference sample. The continuous axonometric \nand profile extraction for the as-received sample shown in Figure 3 revealed that in relation to the laser \npatterned samples the surface of the as-received sample (AR) was markedly smoother with peak heights \nof up to 0.4 \u03bcm leading to Sa and Ra values of 0.04 and 0.03 \u03bcm, respectively. This is contrasted with the \nlaser patterned samples, in which the continuous axonometric images and profile extractions for the laser \npatterned samples can be seen in Figure 4 \u2013 7. Figure 4 shows the resulting continuous axonometric and \nprofile extraction from the WLI analysis of the 50 \u03bcm trench patterned sample. From this, it can be seen  \nthat the surface topography for the 50 \u03bcm trench sample is considerably rougher in comparison to the as-\nreceived sample with peak heights of up to 10 \u03bcm and roughness values of 2.66 and 1.63 \u03bcm for Sa and \nRa, respectively. Similar values with an Sa of 2.65 \u03bcm, an Ra of 1.43 \u03bcm and peak heights ranging \nbetween 10 and 15 \u03bcm, were also observed for the sample laser patterned using 100 \u03bcm trenches (see \nFigure 5). It is evident from both Figures 4 and 5 that a significant amount of surface melting has taken \nplace as a direct result of the laser-material interaction. This melting and re-solidification can be seen to \neliminate some of the intended periodic pattern induced by the laser processing. This can also be seen in \nFigures 6 and 7 which depict the results from the WLI analysis of the 50 and 100 \u03bcm hatch patterns, \nrespectively. The elimination of the intended periodic pattern is highly demonstrated with the observed \nresults of the 50 \u03bcm hatch pattern (see Figure 6) as only one axis is well defined for the pattern. As \ndiscussed previously this is owed to the way in which the material interacts with the PMMA surface. That \nis, for the hatch patterns, the laser system scanned one axis first and then another giving rise to the pattern \ninduced on the first scan being eradicated due to the melting and re-solidification arising from the second \nscan.   \nEven though the periodic hatch pattern was somewhat eradicated during the laser processing it can be \nseen that the surface topography was also ultimately modified in comparison to the as-received sample. It \nwas found that the 50 \u03bcm hatch pattern gave rise to peak heights to a maximum of approximately 12 \u03bcm \nwith the surface roughness parameters being somewhat different to the other laser patterned samples with \nan Sa of 3.16 \u03bcm and Ra of 0.87. This difference is born from the large difference between the Sa and Ra \nvalues for this sample. However, this can be seen to be of significance due to the fact that the Ra value \ncould have been taken along a smoother section of the surface which had undergone melting and re-\nsolidification. This could have resulted in a dramatic reduction of the Ra parameter. In contrast, the Sa \nparameter takes in to account the whole area of the continuous axonometric and as such both rougher and \nsmoother sections of the surface would be taken in to account. Therefore, in this instance it can be argued \nthat the Sa parameter value is more descriptive of the sample surface. \nFigure 7 shows that, as a result of the laser induced hatch pattern, the surface appears smoother in \ncomparison to the other laser patterned samples. This is owed to melting and re-solidification as the laser \nbeam is scanned across the surface. It should also be noted that compared to Figure 6, Figure 7 shows that \nthe 100 \u03bcm hatch pattern (H100) keeps more of the natural periodicity of the pattern owed to the fact that \nthe larger dimensions allow for the scanned pattern to not over lap itself. The smoothness observed from \nthe 100 \u03bcm hatch pattern (see Figure 7) was confirmed by obtaining Sa and Ra values of 1.61 and 0.98 \n\u03bcm, respectively. Like the 50 \u03bcm hatch pattern shown in Figure 6, the Ra parameter can be seen to be \nlower due to this parameter taking into account a single line profile rather than including the whole area \nwhich is incorporated in determining the Sa parameter. It was also observed that for the 100 \u03bcm hatch \npattern peak heights of up to 15 \u03bcm were obtained. This result coincides with the peak height values \narising from the other laser patterned samples. \n4.2 \u2013 Effect of Laser Irradiation on the Wettability Characteristics \nIt has already been seen that the laser surface patterning has a large effect on the surface topography. As \nsuch it is highly probable that these variations in surface topography would have had a significant \nconsequence on the resulting wettability. Table 1 shows a summary of the topography and wettability data \nobtained for each sample studied. In terms of wettability it can be seen that the as-received PMMA \n(sample AR) was predominantly hydrophilic on account of the characteristic contact angle being less than \n90\u00b0. In comparison to the as-received sample (AR) there was a significant reduction in contact angle for \nboth the 50 \u03bcm trench and hatch pattern (samples T50 and H50, respectively) allowing these samples to \nbecome more hydrophilic. In contrast, the 100 \u03bcm trench pattern (sample T100) gave rise to a contact \nangle that is greater than that of the as-received sample (AR) and can also be seen as hydrophobic since \nthe contact angle is greater than 90\u00b0. It was also seen that the contact angle was equivalent to the as-\nreceived sample (AR) for the 100 \u03bcm hatch patterned sample (H100). \nWith regards to the 50 \u03bcm dimension patterned samples (T50 and H50) the reduction in contact angle \ncould be seen to be a result of the increase in surface roughness, apparent polar component, \u03b3P, and \nincrease in total surface energy, \u03b3T. This is concurrent with existing theory which states that for a \nhydrophilic material the contact angle should decrease upon an increase in surface roughness and \napparent \u03b3P [4,35] Conversely, for the 100 \u03bcm trench and hatch patterned samples (T100 and H100) the \ncontact angle was seen to increase even though the surface roughness and \u03b3T had increased considerably. \nHowever, for both of these samples it can be seen that \u03b3p decreased in comparison to the as-received \nsample (AR). So, it is likely, especially for sample H100, that a combination between surface roughness \nand \u03b3p was counteracting each other to obtain the observed contact angle of 84.4\u00b0, which was equivalent \nto the contact angle observed with AR. \nOne possible explanation to the observation of significant variation in contact angle for the 100 \u03bcm trench \npattern (T100) is that of the dominant wetting regime present. For those samples with contact angles less \nthan that obtained for the as-received sample (AR), it is highly likely that the Wenzel wetting regime (see \nFigure 8(a)) is dominant in which the whole surface wets. For the laser patterned samples which had \ncontact angles greater than that obtained for the as-received sample it is possible that either the Cassie-\nBaxter regime (see Figure 8(b)) is dominant or an intermediate mixed state (see Figure 8(c)) is present. \nThe Cassie-Baxter regime (see Figure 8(b)) describes a droplet of water on a surface which gives rise to \nair gaps forming along the liquid-surface boundary. Whereas the intermediate mixed state (see Figure \n8(c)), as discussed by Lee and Kwon [31], refers to a droplet of liquid on a surface in which both Wenzel \nand Cassie-Baxter regimes are present. That is the surface roughness along with the induced pattern yields \na water droplet which is held in an intermediate state such that both wetting regimes coexist. This mixed \nwetting regime arising can also account for the observed reduction in apparent \u03b3P and increase in contact \nangle owed to the laser induced topographical pattern on the hydrophilic PMMA samples. This could be \napplied to what has been observed with the 100 \u03bcm trench pattern (T100) where the induced \ntopographical pattern on the PMMA has given rise to the droplet sitting up on the surface giving rise to \nair gaps forming in the trenches of the pattern. This could then indicate that under certain circumstances \nthe topographical pattern of the PMMA surface dominates the wettability characteristics.   \nIn addition to the data given in Table 1, it was necessary to use XPS analysis to obtain surface chemistry \ndata in order to detail any changes made during the laser processing. As such the data in Table 2 gives the \nsurface composition for the as-received sample (AR), 100 \u03bcm trench sample (T100) and the 50 \u03bcm hatch \nsample (H50). The two laser patterned samples were decided upon by taking the samples with the greatest \nincrease and greatest reduction in contact angle, respectively, in comparison to the as-received sample. \nFrom Table 2, it was identified that the carbon content of each of the laser patterned samples decreased \nslightly; whereas the oxygen content had increased slightly. It should be noted here that the other \nelements present arise from the manufacturing of the polymer sheets. Owing to the data given in Table 2 \nit is possible to determine that a change in oxygen content alone, in this instance, does not give an \nexplanation to the variation in contact angles observed. As a result it is highly likely that the change in \ncontact angle is dominated by a combination of the laser induced pattern, surface roughness and \u03b3p to give \nrise to different wetting regimes.  \n5.0 \u2013 Conclusions \nThis study has demonstrated that a relatively inexpensive, low power, 10W cw CO2 laser holds the ability \nto significantly modify the surface of PMMA on the micron scale. With the laser powers constant (7W, \n600mms\n-1\n) and inducing differing patterns onto the surface it was found that the surface roughness can be \nincreased by up to an Sa of 3 \u03bcm and an Ra of 1.6 \u03bcm in comparison to the as-received sample which \nyielded an Sa and Ra of 0.04 \u03bcm and 0.03 \u03bcm, respectively. It was also observed that, as a result of the \nthermolytical interaction between the laser beam and the material, considerable melting and re-\nsolidification took place. In some instances, this melting and re-solidification gave rise to the eradication \nof the natural periodicity of the laser induced pattern. This was especially seen for the 50 \u03bcm hatch \nsample as the beam scan of the pattern overlapped owed to the laser spot size incident on to the material \nbeing 95 \u03bcm. \nIn terms of wettability it was seen that, irrespective of an increase in surface roughness and surface \noxygen content, the contact angles differed over the patterns induced using the laser system. That is, for \nthe 50 \u03bcm dimension patterned samples a reduction in the contact angle was observed in which the \nsamples become more hydrophilic. Whereas, the 100 \u03bcm dimension patterned samples gave rise to \ncontact angles equivalent or greater to that of the as-received sample. For instance, the 100 \u03bcm trench \npattern produced a contact angle of slightly above 90\u00b0 allowing the material to become inherently \nhydrophobic. \nThere does not appear to be a clear parameter which appears to be dominating in order to explain the \ndiffering contact angles observed. However, it is possible to see that a combination of a number of \nparameters such as surface pattern, surface roughness and \u03b3p could ultimately contribute to the observed \ncontact angle. Even so, in some instances it can be seen that a change in wetting regime owed to the \nsurface topography could possibly be the dominating factor giving rise to contact angles larger than \nexpected for a hydrophilic material such as nylon 6,6.  As a result, one can see that more work is required \nto determine the contributing factors which establish the contact angle taking place. \n6 \u2013 Acknowledgements \nThe authors would like to thank the Materials Department, Loughborough University for use of their XPS \nequipment.
