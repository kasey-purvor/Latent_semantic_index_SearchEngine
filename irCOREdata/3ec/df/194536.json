There has been\nsome, but limited, subsequent critical interest. Where he is known, it is most-\nly likely to be through the Bill Douglas Centre for the History of Cinema and\nPopular Culture at Exeter University, or for the three films\u2014My Childhood\n(1972), My Ain Folk (1973) and My Way Home (1978)\u2014commonly referred\nto as the Trilogy. It is common also to describe these as autobiographical:\nfollowing a discussion of the films of Terence Davies, Sarah Street noted that\n\u201cBill Douglas\u2019s major work was similarly autobiographical\u201d; the biographical\nnote accompanying the Connoisseur Video release of the films refers to the\n\u201cautobiographical Trilogy\u201d; and for the initial London release of My Child-\nhood, Douglas himself was quoted as saying that the \u201cautobiographical factor\nis the main component. The childhood of the title is literally my childhood\nand the incidents that I recount are with a few variations things that actually\nhappened to me.\u201d1\nThe films are not documentaries. The first draft of My Childhood had ini-\ntially been titled Jamie, and the name of Jamie was retained for the central\ncharacter, played in each of the three films by Stephen Archibald in a cast of\nprofessional and non-professional actors. The draft was apparently shown to\nthe film director Lindsay Anderson, who, \u201cto Douglas\u2019s great consternation,\nimmediately intuited that it was autobiographical,\u201d suggested dropping \u201cits\nevasive title and calling it simply My Childhood,\u201d and who when interviewed\non the BBC Radio 4 arts program Kaleidoscope at the time of the release of\nMy Ain Folk, described that film as having \u201cthe quality of really superb auto-\nbiographical writing.\u201d2\nHowever, queries have been raised about such descriptions. Anderson\u2019s\ninterviewer, Paul Vaughan, was apologetic when he went on ask about Dou-\nglas, \u201cDo you think, I mean can you see him stepping beyond this, oh I\n03-Barefoot  5\/10\/06  1:59 PM  Page 14\nBarefoot, Autobiography and the Autobiographical in the Bill Douglas Trilogy 15\nshouldn\u2019t say beyond it, that implies a criticism in a way, but stepping away\nfrom this kind of autobiographical picture, into something less personal?\u201d\nAdrian Noble expressed stronger reservations in his writings on the Trilogy.\nWhile Noble noted Anderson\u2019s intuition in recognizing the autobiographical\nnature of Douglas\u2019s initial script, he also argued that Douglas \u201cwas a visionary\nstoryteller, not a factualist,\u201d and wrote that \u201calthough the Trilogy is often seen\nas autobiography, this is too simplistic a response\u201d (\u201cBill Douglas\u201d 13, 24).\nNoble was here raising slightly different questions, since leaving aside the\nquestion of whether the autobiographer needs to be a \u201cfactualist,\u201d the auto-\nbiographical and autobiography are not necessarily the same. One approach\nto discussing film as autobiography has been to make a distinction between\nautobiography and autobiographical fiction\u2014hence P. Adam Sitney\u2019s argu-\nment that specific examples of avant-garde cinema, such as Stan Brakhage\u2019s\nScenes from Under Childhood (1967\u20131970), function as autobiography, but\nneed to be distinguished from the autobiographical fiction of a film such as\nFran\u00e7ois Truffaut\u2019s Les Quatres Cents Coups (1959) (60\u201361). Elizabeth Bruss\ndoes discuss the Truffaut film in her article on \u201cautobiography in film,\u201d\nidentifying it as \u201cclose to autobiography,\u201d but in her argument, film is seen\nas upsetting \u201ceach of the parameters\u2014\u2018truth-value,\u2019 \u2018act-value\u2019 and \u2018identity-\nvalue\u2019\u2014that we commonly associate with the autobiographical act to such an\nextent that even deliberate attempts to re-create the genre in cinematic terms\nare subtly subverted\u201d (301).\nIt is not argued here that Bill Douglas\u2019s Trilogy belongs to a genre of film\nautobiography. The films do have affinities with other groups of films which\nfollow a central character from boyhood to manhood: Truffaut\u2019s Antoine\nDoinel series, Satyajit Ray\u2019s Apu Trilogy, and the three Mark Donskoi films\nbased on Maxim Gorky\u2019s autobiography are probably the most obvious\nexamples. However, the gap between the director\u2019s life and the films he made\nis narrower in the case of Douglas. While Noble\u2019s insistence on Douglas as\na \u201cvisionary storyteller, not a factualist\u201d suggests that to understand the films\nsimply as autobiography is to limit them, this discussion is an attempt to\nexamine some of the complexities in the autobiographical nature of My Child-\nhood, My Ain Folk, and My Way Home, and how differences between film and\nthe written word can be illuminating. My concern is not simply the films\nthemselves, but also the production process, their reception, and the ways in\nwhich they have been framed. Using the parameters that Bruss identifies\n(truth-value, act-value, and identity-value) as a starting point, I will examine\nthe issue of the films\u2019 fidelity to Douglas\u2019s life, and the extent to which they\ncan be understood in terms of personal performance, before focusing in par-\nticular on the second film of the Trilogy: My Ain Folk. Here the relationship\n03-Barefoot  5\/10\/06  1:59 PM  Page 15\nbetween film and written language will be explored through an examination\nof the relationship between the opening sequence of My Ain Folk, the script\nwhich in its published form was described as the \u201cfinal draft which was the\nbasis of that film\u2019s production,\u201d and a brief written account that Douglas gave\nof his childhood, which has been given the title \u201cThe Palace of Dreams: The\nMaking of a Film-Maker.\u201d3 Thus the aim is to examine the relationship\nbetween literary autobiography and the autobiographical film, the particular\nway in which Bill Douglas\u2019s Trilogy is autobiographical rather than an auto-\nbiography, and the practice as well as the theory of the autobiographical film.\nFICTIONAL NARRATIVE AND TRUTH-VALUE\nThe Trilogy follows Jamie from his poverty-stricken childhood in a Scottish\nmining village during the Second World War to the relative liberation of\nNational Service in the Middle East in the 1950s. In My Childhood we are\nintroduced to Jamie and the boy who initially appears to be his older broth-\ner, Tommy, both living with their maternal grandmother. It is a life of mate-\nrial and emotional deprivation, briefly alleviated by moments of affection\nbetween Jamie and Tommy, and through Jamie\u2019s temporary friendship with\na German prisoner-of-war. In the course of the film, Jamie and the audience\ngradually discover that Jamie and Tommy have different mothers and fathers,\nand that Jamie\u2019s mother is in an asylum and that his father lives across the\nstreet. The film ends with the death of his maternal grandmother. In My Ain\nFolk, Tommy is taken away to an Edinburgh children\u2019s home, while Jamie\nmoves in with his paternal grandmother, and to an even bleaker existence,\nbefore he is also taken the children\u2019s home. In My Way Home he returns tem-\nporarily to the mining village, makes his first awkward efforts at earning a\nliving in Edinburgh, is briefly adopted by a foster parent, runs away, and then\nduring his National Service is befriended by Robert, an Englishman from a\nvery different class and educational background. Towards the end of the film\nthere is a brief exchange beneath a poster advertising the Hollywood film Nia-\ngara (1952), in which Robert, having been asked what he\u2019ll do \u201cwhen you\nget back?\u201d says, \u201cWhat about you?\u201d Jamie replies, \u201cI want to be an artist,\u201d\npauses to think, then continues, \u201cMaybe even a film director.\u201d\nThe broad narrative here conforms to a common pattern within literary\nautobiography, which is often concerned not just with incidents from the\nauthor\u2019s early life, but also with how these incidents lead up to the emergence\nof a writer, and thus to the process of literary creation itself. Where Douglas\ndeparts from this model is in part on points of detail. He admitted himself\nthat the incidents he depicted were \u201cwith a few variations things that actually\n16 Biography 29.1 (Winter 2006)\n03-Barefoot  5\/10\/06  1:59 PM  Page 16\nhappened to me.\u201d Slightly more specifically, Noble states that Douglas \u201ceither\nradically changed chronological sequence,\u201d or depicted \u201ckey elements that did\nnot happen to him at all. For example, he did not have a German prisoner-\nof-war friend\u201d (\u201cBill Douglas\u201d 24). In Bruss\u2019s definition of \u201ctruth-value\u201d as\na parameter of classical autobiography, \u201can autobiography purports to be con-\nsistent with other evidence; we are conventionally invited to compare it with\nother documents that describe the same events (to determine its veracity) and\nwith anything the author may have said or written on other occasions (to\ndetermine its sincerity)\u201d (299\u2013300). Such a definition and comparison would\nplace the Trilogy outside the parameters of autobiography. \nThe extent to which consistency with other evidence exists as a necessary\n\u2014or even possible\u2014feature of autobiography could be debated. However,\ndespite Douglas\u2019s comments about the title being literally his childhood, the\nextent to which the Trilogy even purports to factual veracity is at best uncer-\ntain. John Caughie has noted Douglas\u2019s admiration for the Soviet montage\nschool of directors, and for the films of Mark Donskoi in particular (27). It\nwas Donskoi who filmed Maxim Gorky\u2019s autobiographical trilogy, including\nthe first volume, known in translation as My Childhood, the film\u2019s translated\ntitle being The Childhood of Maxim Gorky (and on occasion, My Childhood ).\nIn adopting the title My Childhood (as opposed to Jamie), Douglas was\nacknowledging the autobiographical nature of the project, and locating the\nfilm within a tradition of autobiography, though also referencing the slight-\nly different tradition of film adaptations of literary autobiography. Another,\nagain slightly different, literary reference arises in the moment in My Way\nHome when the resentment of Jamie\u2019s grandmother thaws to the extent that\nshe gives him a present: a copy of David Copperfield (before she accuses him\nof removing her name from the book, prompting him to rip out the pages).\nIn this instance the self-conscious reference to another narrative of childhood\nsuffering invokes autobiographical fiction as opposed to autobiography.\nPRODUCTION AND ACT-VALUE\nAutobiography is a personal performance, an action that exemplifies the\ncharacter of the agent responsible for that action and how it is performed.\n\u2014Elizabeth Bruss (300)\nElizabeth Bruss argues that one of the ways in which film disrupts the \u201cact-\nvalue\u201d necessary for autobiography is in its reliance on a disparate group of\ndistinct roles and separate stages of production rather than a single source.\nOne model for understanding film has been provided by variations of the\nBarefoot, Autobiography and the Autobiographical in the Bill Douglas Trilogy 17\n03-Barefoot  5\/10\/06  1:59 PM  Page 17\nauteur theory, yet Bruss notes that \u201cAuthors must exercise their own capac-\nities where auteurs are free to delegate; authors actually possess the abilities\nthat auteurs need only oversee, and they fabricate what filmmakers may only\nneed to find\u201d (304). This might be questioned on a number of different\ngrounds. The notion of the film director as auteur that emerged in the 1950s\nand 1960s was not the same as that of the literary author, but this was in part\nbecause it was based on a Romantic notion of personal expression that was\nnot ascribed solely on the basis of exclusive responsibility for either writing or\ndirecting. Literary authors do not have to work alongside scriptwriters, cam-\neramen, set designers, and light and sound technicians, and the role of the lit-\nerary editor is rather different from that of film editor, though it does point\nto how the image of literary production as an entirely solitary occupation\nneeds some correction. Filmmakers both find and fabricate; consider not just\nTruffaut\u2019s Antoine Doinel films, but the same director\u2019s La Nuit Americain\/\nDay for Night (1973), the very title of which refers to the process by which\ndaylight footage can be manipulated to create the impression of night, and\nthus to the broader way in which, as even Andr\u00e9 Bazin understood it, \u201creal-\nism in art can only be achieved in one way\u2014through artifice\u201d (26).\nFilm production on any scale almost inevitably increases the number of\ndifferent individuals involved, and decreases the space for individual expres-\nsion. Notwithstanding Peter Wollen\u2019s claim that it remains possible for the\nvoices of individual directors working within the Hollywood studio system to\nbe heard above what he referred to as \u201cnoise,\u201d those searching for a cinema\nof autobiographical authorship have tended to look elsewhere (71). It was\nwithin the avant-garde, rather than the commercial mainstream, that Sitney\nidentified examples of film autobiography, while more recently Kathleen\nMcHugh has noted that, \u201cexperimental filmic autobiography has been and\ncontinues to be confined to nonindustry or artisanal modes of production\u201d\n(275).\nFunded as it was by the British Film Institute, the production context of\nthe Trilogy was some distance from the commercial mainstream, though the\nsituation is complicated by the fact that the films were made during a peri-\nod when there was pressure from within the BFI to support both a more rad-\nical, oppositional, and anti-realist experimentalism, and collective filmmak-\ning rather than the individual auteur.4 Relative shelter from box office\ndemands did not, anyway, make for total directorial autonomy. For Dou-\nglas, the downside of the critical success of My Childhood was that it gave his\nwork a higher profile, and thus made it more liable to interference. In his\naccount of the editing of My Ain Folk, he writes that \u201cI felt more and more\nthe film being taken out of my grasp. The good free days of My Childhood\n18 Biography 29.1 (Winter 2006)\n03-Barefoot  5\/10\/06  1:59 PM  Page 18\nBarefoot, Autobiography and the Autobiographical in the Bill Douglas Trilogy 19\nwere over. Whether I liked it or not I was going to be controlled\u201d (qtd. in\nNoble, \u201cMaking\u201d 141). Douglas\u2019s determination to resist such control led to\na particular fraught post-production, culminating in the occasion when the\ndirector was forcibly ejected from the BFI\u2019s premises and threatened with\npolice action. The result was his reluctant agreement to leave the film in the\nhands of Peter West, the project\u2019s editor, who in fact completed the film by\nreturning to the script that Douglas had written, but progressively deviated\nfrom, in his suggested changes (Noble, \u201cMaking\u201d 147\u201348).\nAsked at one point whether he would have preferred to do everything\nhimself, Douglas protested that he didn\u2019t \u201cwant to be a cameraman. I just\nwant to write the script and to make the film. . . . I like ensemble playing,\nwe are making the film\u201d (qtd. in Noble, \u201cMaking\u201d 117). Yet, according to\nMamoun Hassan, then Head of Production at the BFI, Douglas left little\nroom for collaboration. Rather than ensemble playing, Hassan described\nDouglas\u2019s working method as one of \u201ccommunicating pain,\u201d a pain that can\nbe traced back to the personal nature of the subject matter, and the fact that\nmost of the filming took place in Newcraighall, the scene of his unhappy\nchildhood (24).\nDescribing the passage from memory to script to film, Douglas talked to\nHassan and another editor, Charles Rees, in terms of both willpower and\nemotion:\nWell when, say, I\u2019m writing a scene with my grandfather sitting at a table or what-\never it is, if it\u2019s going to work for me, the scene, the writing, I\u2019m totally within the\natmosphere of the room. . . . And when I see the man there who is going to be my\ngrandfather, I will hypnotise him into being that thing. And he sits there, and I\ncome and we look through the camera and I\u2019m looking again for these sensations\nI felt when I was writing. Maybe I will it in there, I don\u2019t know, but I believe it\nwhen I\u2019m looking through the camera at that set-up. . . . So that I\u2019m just recap-\nturing what I truly felt at the time\u2014I laughed here when I was doing it, and when\nthere was crying, I cried here when I was doing it\u2014I really went through it all. I\u2019m\nall the characters, if you like, and one is really putting that back again. And if I don\u2019t\nfeel it, then I know it\u2019s a lie for me. And when we are in the editing, hopefully one\nis bringing that back. (qtd. in Noble, \u201cMaking\u201d 122\u201323)\nBut for Douglas, it was the editing that presented the most difficulties. Accord-\ning to West, Douglas\nbecame more and more obsessive about certain aspects of the film that were to do\nwith his own inability to dissociate himself from the actual life that he lived and\nthe artefact he created. This caused him to ask for scenes to be cut or dropped. For\nexample the father he had created on screen so disturbed him that he wanted the\nrole diminished. (qtd. in Noble, \u201cMaking\u201d 146)\n03-Barefoot  5\/10\/06  1:59 PM  Page 19\nWest\u2019s return to Douglas\u2019s script may have enabled the restoration of scenes\nthat the director had asked to be dropped, but the Trilogy as a whole needs\nto be understood as a work of omissions and gaps as well as remembered and\nrecreated scenes.\n\u201cTHE PALACE OF DREAMS,\u201d THE OPENING OF MY AIN FOLK, AND\nIDENTITY-VALUE\nFilms are commonly promoted with biographical, occasionally autobiograph-\nical, information about the filmmakers. Douglas took part in this reluctantly:\nthe beginning of Bill Douglas: A Lanternist\u2019s Approach features Noble\u2019s state-\nment that \u201cBill Douglas would have been less than happy at the prospect of\na biographical introduction to this book\u201d (\u201cBill Douglas\u201d 13). But as already\ndiscussed, to some extent he did talk and write about his childhood, notably\nin \u201cThe Palace of Dreams,\u201d which begins\nFor as long as I can remember I always liked the pictures. As a boy I spent so much\ntime in cinemas, a friend suggested I take my bed with me. I would have had it been\npossible. That was my real home, my happiest place when I was lucky to be there.\nOutside, whether in the village or the city, whether I was seven or seventeen, it\nalways seemed to be raining or grey and my heart would sink to despairing depths.\nI hated reality. Of course I had to go to school\u2014sometimes. And I had to go home\nand apply myself to the things one has to do. But the next picture, how to get in,\nwas the thing that occupied my mind. \nThere was never any money to buy a ticket. Still, there were ways. I could get into\nthe Pavilion, or The Flea Pit as we called it, for the price of two jam jars, washed\nor unwashed. That they were acceptable unwashed was no mean concession as I\nwould sometimes have to ferret through buckets for the sticky objects and make a\ndesperate last minute dash so as not to miss the beginning of the picture.\nDouglas goes on to describe how\nWe sat on hard wooden benches, in the \u2018cheapies\u2019. The Pavilion interior was a cob-\nwebby place: an ancient curtain hung sadly to one side of the screen, sometimes\nrefusing to be drawn, while mice nibbled at the ankles. But who cared about that\nwhen Sabu was riding his elephant? It was paradise sitting there in the cosy dark\nbeing hypnotised by the play of light. Up there was the best of all possible worlds.\nTo enter this world, that was the dream.\nOnly later did I become aware that real human beings actually worked on the films,\nthat behind the stars was a producer, director, writer, cameraman, designer and so\non. It was about this time I nourished the idea of working in the industry. . . . \n20 Biography 29.1 (Winter 2006)\n03-Barefoot  5\/10\/06  1:59 PM  Page 20\nThe experience of the cinema features also in My Way Home and My Ain\nFolk. In the latter, Jamie momentarily escapes to watch a George Formby\nfilm, while at the very beginning of the film we see Tommy watching Lassie\nCome Home (1943). The \u201cfinal draft script\u201d opens:\nA beautiful Scottish landscape full of sun and laughter and lilting music.\nBut it all happens on a screen in a drab picture house.\nYoung Tommy is crying in the darkness.\nBeyond the cinema foyer we see a heartless place. We enter into its cold deserted\nstreets and the houses and the bleak sky that falls like a sheet behind the pit wheel.\nBelow at the pit shaft gate we see a group of miners, waiting, static, like images out\nof a dream. They drift silently away inside the gate mouth.\nBeyond the shaft gate we see a square of white sky. Suddenly the lift descends,\nblack earth rushing up to shut out the light. We hear the sound of a long unbro-\nken mountainous whine.\nMY AIN FOLK\nA Scottish Mining Village. Peacetime 1946.\nBlack. The whining sound cuts abruptly.\nNow we see in the cold light of day an open stairway in the village. At the bottom\nof the steps there is Jamie\u2019s father, Mr Knox, in his pit clothes, agitated, pacing up\nand down. At the top, on the stair landing, there is a man in black waiting.\nMr Knox kicks a stone to release his anger.\nYoung Tommy peering through a hole in the foyer curtain. He is eying a cash desk\ninside which there is a snoozing cashier. Somewhere below her domain there is a\n\u2018Today\u2019 poster heralding Lassie Come Home.

(Douglas, My Ain Folk 55\u201356)\nFilm and script only diverge to a limited extent. There are slight variations in\nthe dialogue; for instance, Mr Knox tells Jamie \u201cYou know you\u2019ve made me\nlate for work\u201d rather that simply saying \u201cYou\u2019re late!\u201d More significantly,\nrather than a title announcing the time and place, following the film title we\nare given three statements:\nGranny died leaving Tommy and me to fend for ourselves\nTommy had no idea where his father was but I knew where to find mine\nAs things turned out I wasn\u2019t sure about anything\n22 Biography 29.1 (Winter 2006)\n03-Barefoot  5\/10\/06  1:59 PM  Page 22\nBarefoot, Autobiography and the Autobiographical in the Bill Douglas Trilogy 23\nStephen Archibald as Jamie in My Ain Folk (1973). (Image \u00a9 and reproduced by courtesy of the\nBritish Film Institute, BFI Stills Sales.)\nThe editing provides a montage of shots rather than the continuity of Holly-\nwood cinema. Many of the images are still, and apart from a slight movement\nto follow Tommy as he tries to get past Mr. Knox, the camera is motionless\nthroughout the sequence, and rarely moves in the film as a whole. An austeri-\nty is also conveyed through the use of black-and-white photography, which no\ndoubt contributed to the tendency to link the Trilogy to a tradition of British\nrealism, but which Douglas himself justified on the slightly different grounds\nthat \u201cthe memories of my life are all without colour.\u201d5 The only divergence\nfrom this comes in the brief Technicolor extract from Lassie Come Home.\nIn \u201cThe Palace of Dreams\u201d the film reference is slightly different: to Sabu\n(of Elephant Boy fame), and therefore to an exotic and overtly foreign world.\nIn contrast, Lassie Come Home suggests both another world (Hollywood) and\na version of a landscape that is closer to home (the extract is from the section\nof the film set in Scotland). However, \u201chome\u201d here evokes an absence rather\nthan a presence. The Hollywood film\u2019s Highland setting offers a stark contrast\nto the literally and metaphorically colorless Scotland presented in the rest of\nthe film. It is significant also that in returning home, Lassie escapes from the\nScottish Highlands to go back to Hollywood\u2019s version of an affectionate York-\nshire home, just as in the final film of the Trilogy, My Way Home, Jamie\napparently returns to England rather than Scotland, while in My Ain Folk the\n03-Barefoot  5\/10\/06  1:59 PM  Page 23\nshot of a poster advertising Lassie Come Home is almost immediately followed\nby a sequence of shots which effectively depict the destruction of the more\ndesolate, but still close, Scottish home that Tommy and Jamie had known,\nand by Tommy being taken away to a children\u2019s \u201chome,\u201d where Jamie will\nalso eventually be taken. The scene in the cinema draws upon Douglas\u2019s own\nexperiences, but is not there simply to record those experiences.\nIn spatial and temporal terms, the written account covers a wider terri-\ntory than the film sequence. There are references not just to the cinema, the\nvillage, and home, but also to school, the grocers, and wherever it is that jam\njars are to be found. The account as a whole is explanatory, and conforms to\na chronological pattern: the description of the cinema is followed by an\naccount of Douglas\u2019s attempts to translate his fascination for the cinema into\na career, his eventual entrance into the London Film School, and to the mak-\ning of the Trilogy itself. But the initial description of cinema-going is not\nlocated in a particular time or even place: Douglas refers to \u201cwhether in the\nvillage or the city, whether I was seven or seventeen.\u201d Such phrases do not\nhave an equivalent in film. We may not be given precise information as to\nwhen or where what we are shown is taking place, and we can cross-cut\nbetween different locations, and flash back or forward in time, but a shot\nshows a particular place and moment, rather than alternative points in time.\nWhere \u201cThe Palace of Dreams\u201d has a narrower focus is in its concern with\nthe cinema, the always-raining environment beyond the cinema merely pro-\nviding a background to a description of an obsession with watching films, in\nthe My Ain Folk opening, this pleasure is set against what happens outside the\ncinema, and in particular, the consequences of the death of Tommy and\nJamie\u2019s grandmother. The Trilogy as a whole is remarkable for the way in\nwhich it condenses different experiences and occurrences into a few images.\nA shot in which Tommy and Mr. Knox are shown confronting each other\nillustrates the animosity between the man and the boy, and the boy\u2019s distress\nand anger at his grandmother\u2019s death, but it also alludes to the worlds of work\n(Mr. Knox\u2019s miner\u2019s outfit, his comment about being late) and entertainment\n(the jam jars covering Tommy\u2019s hands).\nThere is some sense of chronology in the film: the words on the screen\nannouncing that \u201cGranny died\u201d precede the shot of her in the coffin, which\nis followed by the shot of the grit on the coffin, and in the following sequence\nby Jamie, now deprived of one grandmother, escaping to the house of his\npaternal grandmother. But there is little concern with providing a clear sense\nof duration or explanation. It is unclear what exactly is the temporal rela-\ntionship between the first shot of Tommy watching Lassie Come Home, the\nsubsequent shots of Tommy in the cinema foyer while Lassie Come Home is\n24 Biography 29.1 (Winter 2006)\n03-Barefoot  5\/10\/06  1:59 PM  Page 24\nBarefoot, Autobiography and the Autobiographical in the Bill Douglas Trilogy 25\nbeing screened, and the later shots of Tommy confronting Mr. Knox with the\njam jars covering his hands, since these moments seem to be in reverse order.\nTommy in the auditorium is followed by Tommy in the cinema foyer seem-\ningly wanting to get into the auditorium, which is followed by Tommy plus\njam jars, which suggests that he is about to go to the cinema. The governing\nprinciple here is one of evoking the memory of childhood experiences, rather\nthan providing narrative continuity.\nIn \u201cThe Palace of Dreams,\u201d the memory of the cinema is clearly estab-\nlished as that of the author. There is some broadening of focus in the occa-\nsional use of \u201cwe,\u201d and the description of \u201cthe jam jar system\u201d is used to refer\nto the behavior of children in general rather than the author alone. But the\nword that is most frequently used is \u201cI,\u201d which appears forty-four times in the\nessay as a whole, along with twenty uses of \u201cmy.\u201d Given that the essay was\nwritten to accompany screenings of the Trilogy, it points to how the films\nhave been understood, and presented, in autobiographical terms. However,\nwhile in \u201cPalace of Dreams\u201d Douglas wrote \u201cFor as long as I can remember\nI always liked the pictures,\u201d when he wrote the script for My Ain Folk he\nwrote \u201cYoung Tommy is crying in the darkness. . . . Young Tommy is peer-\ning through a hole in the foyer curtain. He is eyeing a cash desk inside which\nthere is a snoozing cashier,\u201d and \u201cYoung Jamie curled up inside a rocking\nchair with his face buried in his arms.\u201d In transforming the script into the\nfilm, Douglas adopted the distanced stance of the static camera and deliber-\nate framing. As Caughie has noted, \u201cAesthetic distance and intense intimacy\n. . . is the dialectical tension which marks the Trilogy\u201d (27). Or, as Douglas\nput it at the end of \u201cThe Palace of Dreams,\u201d \u201cthe making of these films . . .\ncould not be a cathartic exercise. There had to be a distance. I had to be\nobjective so that the characters could come to life, so that the work could\nhave shape.\u201d\nNoble\u2019s account notes that at one point it was suggested that the film be\nbroken up in five places, with inter-titles explaining what was happening. He\ncomments that had these been used it \u201cwould have been both a confession\nof narrative failure and wholly against the grain of Douglas\u2019s use of the image\u201d\n(\u201cMaking\u201d 141). Yet the intertitle beginning \u201cGranny died leaving Tommy\nand me to fend for ourselves\u201d does have an explanatory function that relies on\nwords rather than images. It is also, with the exception of the titles of the indi-\nvidual films, the clearest use of the first person in the whole of the Trilogy.\nYet it is complicated by the immediate visual context, in that it is Jamie who\nat this point thinks he knows where to find his father but then discovers that\nhe isn\u2019t sure about anything, and it is Jamie who shares the \u201cmy\u201d of My Child-\nhood, My Ain Folk, and My Way Home with Bill Douglas, but at this point\n03-Barefoot  5\/10\/06  1:59 PM  Page 25\n26 Biography 29.1 (Winter 2006)\nit is Tommy whom we see responding to the magic of cinema in a way which\nclearly draws upon Douglas\u2019s description of his own childhood fascination.\n\u201cThe unity of subjectivity and subject matter\u2014the implied identity of\nauthor, narrator, and protagonist on which classical autobiography depends,\u201d\nElizabeth Bruss argues, \u201cseems to be shattered by film; the autobiographical\nself decomposes, schisms, into almost mutually exclusive elements of the per-\nson filmed (entirely visible; recorded and projected) and the person filming\n(entirely hidden; behind the camera eye)\u201d (297). Ultimately, a single auto-\nbiographical self is elusive in My Ain Folk and the other films in the Trilogy.\nAside from the broad argument that Bruss makes about the absence of a\nfilmic equivalent to a speech-act where the autobiographical speaker merges\nwith the \u201cI\u201d whose character and adventures are depicted within the literary\nautobiography, in the particular example of the opening of My Ain Folk we\nare presented with one character (Tommy) who at this stage constitutes the\nprimary protagonist, and who occupies the equivalent place that the film\u2019s\ndirector has described himself as occupying in his childhood. We are only\nbriefly presented with a second character, Jamie, whom however the film\nand the Trilogy as a whole identify as the primary protagonist, and who in\nthis sequence is given the role of the narrator, but through the written word\nrather than the image. As quoted earlier, Douglas described how during the\nshooting of the film, \u201cI\u2019m all the characters, if you like.\u201d This empathy needs\nto be seen in relation to the way in which filming was also a question of dis-\nengagement. Both Tommy and Jamie are referred to in the third person in\nthe script, and also through the seemingly objective distance of the camera.\nYet this distance also marks the images as remembrances. On its own, the\nshot of isolated jam jars has little about it that is personal. We simply see five\nslightly grubby but carefully photographed jam jars, accompanied by the faint\nmusic from Lassie Come Home, which is being screened in off-screen space.\nThe shot is given meaning through a previous shot of Tommy\u2019s gaze. What\nis significant here is precisely what is hidden: in terms of the film\u2019s story-\nworld, Tommy, watching from behind the curtain, and the idealized narra-\ntive of home and homeless playing out in the auditorium; but also the auto-\nbiographical self, for whom the shot functions as a remembered image.\nTextual detail is here enmeshed with the extra-textual. The autobio-\ngraphical status of the Trilogy is signified through material outside the frame\nand outside the films\u2014indeed, the films are difficult to comprehend with-\nout such material. In addition, there is a paradoxical sense in which the very\nidentification of the films in terms of the autobiography of a particular indi-\nvidual enables the audience to understand them in a broader sense: My Child-\nhood as Childhood.\n03-Barefoot  5\/10\/06  1:59 PM  Page 26\nI want to close by quoting a further autobiographical account, taken from\nanother piece included in Bill Douglas: A Lanternist\u2019s Account. Andrew\nO\u2019Hagan begins his article with the words:\nI was already biting my nails at the age of five, chewing into them till they bled. My\nearliest memory is of me crouched below the kitchen sink watching my father, an\nAA veteran, scoop handfuls of green and yellow capsules into his mouth from a\nclear plastic tub he hid in the top cupboard. Often, panting milky breath, I\u2019d peer\nthrough a button-hole in my mother\u2019s maroon raincoat, watching her slapping\nhim over the breakfast table. Like most kids I knew, I spent my formative days\nunder coats, within dens and in among the long grass\u2014hiding from my dad. (205)\nThe \u201cI\u201d in the above quotation does not belong to any of the characters who\nfeature in the Trilogy, or to the films\u2019 director, but rather to another person\nwriting about the director and the films. O\u2019Hagan uses his own autobiogra-\nphy as a way of explaining his recognition of the pains of childhood depicted\nin the Trilogy. This recognition is not precluded by the existence of a fictional\nnarrative\u2014the sentimental fiction of Lassie Come Home provides Tommy\nwith a recognition of his own loss and homelessness in the fiercely unsen-\ntimental My Ain Folk\u2014but is particularly enabled through the space that\nthe Trilogy gives the viewer. As Hassan notes, Douglas\u2019s \u201cstyle consisted in\ncreating gaps between scenes\u201d (24). The audience is often forced to construct\na narrative from a single shot. The burial of Jamie and Tommy\u2019s grandmother\nbecomes a shot of grit falling on a coffin. This style, as well as the subject\nmatter, can provide space for the kind of\npersonal autobiographical response given\nby O\u2019Hagan, reinforcing the point that\nthough it may be problematic to see My\nAin Folk and the other films in the Trilo-\ngy as autobiography, the autobiographical\nremains central to our understanding of\nthe films.\nBarefoot, Autobiography and the Autobiographical in the Bill Douglas Trilogy 27\nBill Douglas holding a  publicity leaflet for My Way\nHome (1979).
