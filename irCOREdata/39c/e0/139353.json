Introduction \nIt has long been known that the impact resistance of rubber toughened polymers is strongly \ndependent upon the concentration, size and size distribution of the rubber particles [1]. This \nknowledge has underpinned the development of a wide range of commercially successful \nproducts over the past 50 years.  A good general rule is that small particles (weight-average \ndiameters Dw in the range 0.2\u20130.4 \u03bcm) work well when shear yielding dominates the \ntoughening mechanism, whereas larger particles (Dw between 2 and 3 \u03bcm) are more effective \nwhen multiple crazing is the principal mechanism of energy absorption. \n For any given blend composition, maximum toughness is restricted to a limited range of \nparticle sizes, which is often quite narrow. Moving beyond the preferred range in either \ndirection results in a ductile-brittle transition, as illustrated in Figure 1, where b and d \nrespectively mark the midpoints of the lower and upper transitions and thus define critical \nparticle sizes. The curve is based on results for a specific rubber-toughened nylon 6 (RTPA6) \nblend [2], but with appropriate scaling of particle size and peak height, similar curves could \nbe drawn for almost any well-made rubber-toughened polymer.  \nFor many years, interest in particle size effects came mainly from polymer \nmanufacturers, who were best placed to carry out the necessary experiments. However, the \nintroduction of \u2018supertough\u2019 nylons by DuPont [3-4] in the late 1970s attracted the attention \nof the wider scientific community, for two reasons. First, the new blends were made by the \nnovel process of reactive compounding, which is a relatively simple method for preparing \nblends with controlled particle sizes. Second, the relationships between impact behavior and \nparticle size in RTPA6.6 blends proved to be far from simple [5-6].  \nAs a result of the interest generated by the first publications in this area, there is now a \nsubstantial body of literature describing the effects of particle size on impact behavior in a \nwide range of polyamides [5-25], and in a more limited range of thermoplastic polyesters \n[26-30]. Polypropylene blends present a greater challenge because of their low chemical \nreactivity and more restricted range of average particle sizes, but have nevertheless been the \nsubjects of several investigations [31-35]. \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n1st Sep 2009 \n \n 3\nThis research was stimulated by the pioneering work of Wu, who prepared PA6.6 blends \ncontaining 10%, 15% and 25% of grafted polyolefin rubber.  He varied average particle sizes \nfrom 0.3 to 3.0 \u03bcm, and (as expected) observed DB transitions similar to the one shown in \nsection c-e of Figure 1. However, against expectation he also found that the critical average \nparticle size <D>crit increased systematically with rubber content. On this basis Wu \nconcluded that average particle size was not the primary factor governing impact resistance. \nInstead, he advocated using average inter-particle spacing <dip> as a more fundamental \nparameter, where dip is the smallest distance between the surfaces of neighboring particles.   \nTo calculate <dip> Wu made two simplifying assumptions: that all particles have the \nsame diameter D, and that the particles form a regular cubic array.  The resulting expression \nis:  \n                             )1(1\n6\n3\n1\n\u23a5\u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\n\u23a2\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1 \u2212\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b=><\np\nip Dd \u03c6\n\u03c0\n   \nwhere \u03c6p is the volume fraction of rubber particles.  His plots of Izod impact energy against \nlog<dip> showed that the upper DB transition occurred at the same estimated critical inter-\nparticle spacing in all three sets of RTPA6.6 blends.  Subsequently, Wu made provision for \nthe distribution of particle sizes in melt-compounded blends, and introduced the term \u2018matrix \nligament thickness\u2019 to describe <dip>, in order to shift the focus from the rubber particles to \nthe matrix material [36].  Margolina and Wu postulated that shear yielding occurs only in \nligaments below a critical thickness, and that general yielding takes place when <dip> is \nbelow a critical mean matrix ligament thickness <dip>crit, so that plastic deformation \npercolates across the specimen.  These ideas have been extended and elaborated over the \nyears [37-42]. \n One consequence of increasing rubber content (thereby reducing <dip>) is an increase in \nlocal stress concentrations, as the stress fields surrounding individual particles begin to \noverlap. This has led to suggestions that the inter-particle spacing effect has its origins in \nstress field overlap [7, 43].  In evaluating these suggestions, it is important to differentiate \nbetween reductions in <dip> due to increases in \u03c6p and those due to reductions in D. A higher \nvolume fraction of soft particles inevitably raises stress concentrations in the matrix, because \nthe same loads are borne by a smaller cross-sectional area.  By contrast, changing particle \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n1st Sep 2009 \n \n 4\nsize has no effect on local stress concentrations, provided that the volume fraction and degree \nof dispersion are held constant.  Put simply, there are no length scales in finite element \nanalysis; if all linear dimensions, including particle size and interparticle spacing, are \nchanged by the same ratio, the pattern of stresses across the region under analysis remains \nunchanged. Clearly the impact behavior reported by Wu cannot be explained by stress field \noverlap.  \n Following Wu\u2019s work, Gaymans, Borggreve and co-workers extended the study to \ninclude blends with very small particles, and impact tests at various temperatures [8-13, 26].  \nThey showed that RTPA6 exhibits both a lower and an upper DB transition, and that the \nupper critical particle size defined by point d in Figure 1 is temperature-dependent, varying \ncontinuously from 0.5 \u03bcm at \u221210\u00b0C to 1.5 \u03bcm at 50\u00b0C in RTPA6 blends containing 20 wt % \nof grafted EPDM rubber. Extensive subsequent work has demonstrated the existence of a \nminimum rubber particle size for toughening in other semi-crystalline polyamides [17], \namorphous nylon (a-PA) [2, 44], poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) [45], poly(vinyl \nchloride) (PVC) [46-47] and PA6 containing a variety of different elastomers [22-25]. \n Previous attempts to interpret the impact behavior of these \u2018supertough\u2019 blends have met \nwith mixed success. There is general agreement that very small particles are ineffective \nbecause they are more resistant to cavitation, but to date there has been no convincing \nexplanation for the upper DB transition. Muratoglu, Argon and Cohen have argued that \nsuper-tough behavior in RTPA6 blends is due to an oriented crystalline layer of limited \nthickness (~ 0.15 \u03bcm) which extends radially from the surface of each rubber particle [48-\n51].  However, this hypothesis is not consistent with the strong relationship observed by \nGaymans and co-workers between critical particle size and temperature, nor with recent work \nby Huang et al, which shows that the impact behavior of 80\/20 rubber-toughened blends \nbased on the amorphous nylon Zytel 330 is very similar to that of 80\/20 blends based on PA6 \n[2, 44, 52].   \n Despite this growing body of evidence, the inter-particle spacing theory still has its \nsupporters. Recent articles by Cort\u00e9 and Leibler claim that high levels of toughening are \nextremely difficult to achieve in glassy polymers, and that lamellar crystalline structure in \nsemi-crystalline polymers accounts for the dependence of impact resistance on inter-particle \nspacing [53-54]. Neither of these claims is valid. Supertough blends based on glassy \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n1st Sep 2009 \n \n 5\npolymers have been available commercially since 1958, when core-shell particles were first \nused to make rubber-toughened PVC blends [55-56] . Another very successful family of non-\ncrystalline supertough polymers comprises rubber-toughened blends based on polycarbonate \n[57-60], which were first introduced in the 1960s. There are numerous other examples of \nhigh-performance blends based on glassy polymers. The work of Huang et al on amorphous \nnylon comprehensively undermines the second claim.  Furthermore, the results published by \nCort\u00e9 and Liebler show that critical inter-particle spacings in PA6.6 and PA12 increase \nlinearly with particle diameter and vary inversely with the square of the shear yield stress \n[54].  These findings demonstrate that there is no advantage in using dip rather than D as a \nbasis for comparing impact data, especially as D is much easier to measure experimentally.   \n In light of this evidence, there are sound reasons for abandoning the concept of inter-\nparticle spacing altogether. The alternative is to base all discussions of impact behavior on \nthe size and volume fraction of rubber particles, which are known to affect fracture resistance \nin all polymer blends. From this perspective, any correlations involving spacings should be \nregarded as purely fortuitous.      \nThe aim of the present article is to introduce a new model for deformation and fracture in \npolymer blends, which explains the observed impact behavior without relying on unnecessary \nhypotheses involving dip.  \n2.  Yielding near notch tips \nTo understand the fracture resistance of polymer blends, it is first necessary to analyze \ntheir deformation behavior close to the tip of a sharp notch.  The standard method is to apply \nWestergaard\u2019s crack tip stress field equations [61], as follows: \n( )\n)2(0\n)2(\n)2(....\n2\n3cos\n2\ncos\n2\nsin\n2\n)2(....\n2\n3sin\n2\nsin1\n2\ncos\n2\n)2(....\n2\n3sin\n2\nsin1\n2\ncos\n2\n3\n213\n1\n12\n1\n2\n1\n1\nestressplanein\ndstrainplanein\nc\nr\nK\nb\nr\nK\na\nr\nK\n=\n+=\n=\n+\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2212=\n+\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b +=\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\u03c3\u03bd\u03c3\n\u03b8\u03b8\u03b8\n\u03c0\u03c3\n\u03b8\u03b8\u03b8\n\u03c0\u03c3\n\u03b8\u03b8\u03b8\n\u03c0\u03c3\n \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n1st Sep 2009 \n \n 6\nwhere r and \u03b8  are polar coordinates with their origin at the crack tip, and \u03b8  = 0 on the crack \nplane. Axis 1 is the direction of applied stress, axis 2 is along the crack plane, and axis 3 is \nparallel to the crack tip; the shear stresses \u03c312 act on planes at \u03b8 = 45\u00b0. Most fracture \nmechanics textbooks combine von Mises\u2019 yield criterion with these equations to map the \nboundaries of the resulting shear yield zone [62-65].  Using this principle, rp, the radius of the \nplastic zone on the crack plane (\u03b8 = 0) is then given by: \n)3(\n2\n1\n2\n1\n\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b=\ny\nI\np\nKr \u03c3\u03c0  \nwhere KI = stress intensity factor and \u03c31y = first principal stress at yield.  Provided the \nmaterial near the crack tip is an elastic-plastic continuum, if follows that:  \n( ) )5(21\n2\n1\n)4(\n2\n1\n2\n2\nstrainplaneinKr\nstressplaneinKr\ny\nI\np\ny\nI\np\n\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2212=\n\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b=\n\u03c3\n\u03bd\n\u03c0\n\u03c3\u03c0\n \nwhere \u03c3y = tensile yield stress and \u03bd = Poisson\u2019s ratio.  Since \u03bd = 0.4 in a typical rigid \npolymer, the calculated plastic zone radius in plane stress is higher by a factor of 25 than rp in \nplane strain. It has long been recognized that the simplified treatment outlined above leads to \nan underestimate of rp, because it makes no provision for the redistribution of stress that \ninevitably follows crack tip plasticity.  A simple method of overcoming this problem is to \napply Irwin\u2019s correction, which specifies that the rp values given by equations 3-5 should be \ndoubled [66].  \n Since blends containing high concentrations of cavitated rubber particles cannot be \ndescribed as continua, equations 4 and 5 do not apply to them.  Free from the constraints of \ncontinuum mechanics, the cavitated plastic zones formed in polymer blends are able to \nincrease substantially in radius even under plane strain conditions.  They are by no means \nunique in this respect; microvoid nucleation and growth confer the same advantages on \nductile metals [67].  Any analysis of plastic zone size must be based on yield criteria for \nporous solids. \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n1st Sep 2009 \n \n 7\nWhatever corrections and adjustments are made in calculations of the type outlined \nabove, the values of rp obtained are at best only approximate; where accurate values are \nrequired, it is necessary to use laborious numerical methods.  However, as the main emphasis \nin the present study is on understanding general trends rather than making precise predictions, \nthere are many advantages in adopting a simplified approach. With this in mind, the present \nstudy first combines equations 2a-2d with a critical stress criterion for void formation to \nproduce a series of maps of cavitation around a crack tip, for blends with a range of rubber \nparticle sizes under plane strain loading. The same procedure is then applied to dilatational \nshear yielding in the resulting cavitated zone, and to multiple crazing initiated by the larger \ncavitated particles.  By comparing maps produced in this way, it is possible to determine the \nsequence of events in each blend, and hence gain an insight into the effects of particle size on \nfracture behavior.   \n2.1  Rubber Particle Cavitation \nThe criteria for cavitation in rubber-toughened polymers have been modeled by Lazzeri \nand Bucknall [68-70], using energy-release rate principles similar to those used in fracture \nmechanics. Void formation and expansion in rubber particles are accompanied by the \nformation of new surface, stretching of the surrounding layers of rubber, and stress relaxation \nin the adjacent matrix. To calculate energy changes, the Lazzeri-Bucknall model treats blends \nas assemblies of small volume elements, each consisting of a spherical rubber particle of \nradius R surrounded by a concentric rigid elastic shell of outer radius Q, so that \u03c6p = R3\/Q3.  \nThe total energy released can then be calculated from the potential energy of the element \nbefore and after cavitation. The governing equation is: \nwhere Up(rvd,\u03b5v) = potential energy of the rubber particle; rvd = radius of void;  \u03b5v = current \nvolume strain of the particle (including the void); R = particle radius; Gr , Kr = shear and bulk \nmoduli of rubber;  \u0393r = surface energy of rubber; \u03bbf  = extension ratio of the rubber at fracture \nin biaxial tension.   \n Calculations based on this model show that \u03b5v(cav), the critical volume strain at \ncavitation, increases as the particle size is reduced, essentially because the strain energy \n( ) )6(24\n3\n2),( 32\n2\n3\n3\n3\nfrvdrvd\nvd\nvrvvdp fGrrR\nrKRrU \u03bb\u03c0\u03c0\u03b5\u03c0\u03b5 +\u0393+\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2212=\nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n1st Sep 2009 \n \n 8\nrelease rate is dependent on the size of the local volume element.  When Gr is small, the \nrelationship between log \u03b5v(cav) and log Dp is approximately linear, as shown in Figure 2 \n[71-72].  The dotted line was obtained using equation 6, with Gr = 0.1 MPa, Kr = 2 GPa,  \u0393r \n= 35 mJ m-2, and \u03b5v held constant during cavitation to simplify the calculations; the energy \nreleased by the matrix was not taken into account.     \nFigure 2 compares a line calculated in this way with data obtained by Dompas et al, who \nconfirmed that \u03b5v(cav) is a function of particle size.  Using a series of transparent PVC blends \n[46], these authors showed that a decrease in Dp caused an increase in critical strain to a \nmaximum at \u03b5v(cav) = 0.0128, where the specimens yielded before cavitation at a tensile \nstress of ~55 MPa and an elongation of 0.08. There are strong indications that similar \nrelationships between D and \u03b5v(cav) apply to rubber-toughened polyamides and other blends \ncontaining soft rubber particles (Gr \u2248 0.1 MPa), as predicted by equation 6. Apart from size, \nthe most important factors affecting cavitation (and therefore toughness) are \u0393r, the specific \nenergy required to form new surface, and Gr, the stiffness of the rubber in shear, which \ndetermines the work done in stretching the rubber shell.  \n To fit the experimental data of Dompas et al in Figure 2, it has been necessary to \nshift the original calculated curve upwards, to a level at which the critical volume strains at a \ngiven particle size are approximately double those indicated by the dotted line. Furthermore, \nan even larger upward shift would have been required if energy released by the matrix had \nbeen taken into account when calculating \u03b5v(cav). A possible explanation for this large \ndiscrepancy is that the shear moduli of the experimental rubber particles were substantially \nlarger than 1 MPa.  However, there is no reason to expect particularly high moduli in these \nexperimental rubbers. The main reason for underestimating \u03b5v(cav) is almost certainly more \nfundamental: the original calculations did not allow for the effects of an energy barrier in \nrestricting void formation. They were based on the assumption that stressed void-free \nparticles are unstable whenever there is enough energy to form a void. The alternative \npossibility is that they are metastable, and that an energy barrier controls the transition from \nthe fully-dense to the cavitated state [73].   \n Figure 3 illustrates the effects of particle size on cavitation around a crack tip, calculated \nusing equation 6 with KI = 1.0 MPa m0.5 and values of \u03b5v(cav) taken from the solid line in \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n1st Sep 2009 \n \n 9\nFigure 2. With increasing D, the cavitated zone extends boldly outwards from the crack tip, \nwhich helps to explain the lower brittle-ductile transition illustrated in Figure 1. These results \nshow that the transition can be explained without assuming that small particles are unable to \ncavitate. A more balanced view is that problems arise simply because \u03b5v(cav) is high, which \nlimits the size of the cavitated yield zone, thereby increasing the probability of brittle \nfracture.  In the limit, \u03b5v(cav) becomes so high that the void-free blend yields under plane \nstrain conditions before reaching the particle cavitation stress.  Instead, a craze will extend \nfrom the notch tip, and crack growth will initiate before a significant amount of energy has \nbeen absorbed in ductile deformation.  For a typical blend with a Young\u2019s modulus E = 2 \nGPa and \u03bd = 0.4, a KIC of 1.0 MPa m0.5 corresponds to a fracture surface energy GIC = 420 J \nm-2, which is sufficient to form and rupture a single mature craze.   \n2.2  Shear Yielding  \n The standard criterion for shear yielding in void-free rigid polymers is a pressure-\nmodified version of von Mises\u2019 criterion [74]: \n)7(00 myye P \u03c3\u03bc\u03c3\u03bc\u03c3\u03c3 \u2212\u2261+\u2265  \nwhere \u03c3y0  is the yield stress in pure shear (\u03c3m = 0), \u03bc is the pressure coefficient, P is pressure, \nthe effective stress \u03c3e is given by: \n( ) ( ) ( ) )8(\n2\n2\n13\n2\n32\n2\n21 \u03c3\u03c3\u03c3\u03c3\u03c3\u03c3\u03c3 \u2212+\u2212+\u2212\u2261e  \nand the mean stress \u03c3m is defined as follows: \n)9(\n3\n321\nvbm KP \u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03c3\u03c3 =++=\u2212=  \nwhere Kb is bulk modulus.

Owing to density differences \u03c6p = 0.26.

Blending with \n20% rubber reduces \u03c3yt to 51.5 MPa and \u03c3y0 to 57.6 MPa.

Thus pressure sensitivity helps to \nalleviate the adverse effects of notch tip constraint on shear yielding. \n The presence of voids makes polymers more pressure-sensitive.

They are useful in describing general trends, but cannot be relied on \nto give accurate predictions of yield stress as a function of void content.  One way to compare \nthese equations with predictions based on other models, or with experimental data, is to set \n\u03c3m = 0, which gives the following expression for yielding in pure shear: \n( ) )12()1()0(21)0()( 05.0200 shearpureinvdyvdvdyvdye \u03c6\u03c3\u03c6\u03c6\u03c3\u03c6\u03c3\u03c3 \u2212=+\u2212==  \nwhere \u03c3y0(0) is the yield stress in pure shear for the void-free matrix, and \u03c3y0(\u03c6vd) is the \neffective stress at yield of a porous solid with volume fraction \u03c6vd of voids. Under pure shear \nloading, a similar relationship can be used for void-free rubber-modified blends, with \u03c6p \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n1st Sep 2009 \n \n 11\nreplacing \u03c6vd.   This substitution is justified because, in comparison to the rigid matrix, rubber \nparticles offer negligible resistance to shear stresses, and therefore behave almost exactly like \nvoids in pure shear. As shown in Figure 4, the differences between voids and well-bonded \nsoft particles become apparent only when the composite is subjected to large dilatational \nstresses. It is therefore possible to generalize equation 12 so that it applies to polymer \ncomposites containing a total volume fraction \u03c6 of any type of soft inclusions, including soft \nsolid rubber particles, or voids, or any combination of the two.  The resulting expression is:     \n)13()1()0()( 00 shearpureinyy \u03c6\u03c3\u03c6\u03c3 \u2212=     \nEquations 12 and 13 are simple rule-of-mixtures expressions which provide only first-\norder approximations to the yield behavior of isotropic porous solids and particulate \ncomposites. However, they are consistent with equations 10 and 11, and the four equations \ntogether provide a convenient basis for evaluating the effects of cavitation on yield behavior.     \nFigure 4 clarifies some of the key issues concerning the contribution of void formation to \ntoughness in polymer blends. Cavitation is important in notched specimens because it enables \nthe blend to yield at moderate stresses under plane strain conditions, not because it eliminates \ngeometrical constraints and produces a state of plane stress, as some commentators have \nsuggested. For the fully-cavitated blend, the plane strain line crosses the Gurson curve at \u03c3m = \n52.1 MPa, \u03c3e = 11.1 MPa, which corresponds to a stress state (55.8, 55.8, 44.7), well below \nthe yield stress for the same blend with solid rubber particles. These two sets of data are used \nlater to illustrate the potential effects of large-scale cavitation on the radius of the shear yield \nzone.    \n The principles set out above are applied in Figure 5 to PA6 blends under tensile loading, \nwhere the lower solid curve was obtained using equation 11, on the assumption that all \nparticles have cavitated but none has expanded after cavitation.  In practice, some particles \nwill always remain void free during the early stages of a tensile or notched impact test, while \nothers in the same neighborhood cavitate and increase in volume. Figure 5 also shows \nexperimental yield stress data on a RTPA6 blend containing 26% by volume of rubber \nparticles [2], and predictions for dry PA6 blends containing solid rubber particles, which are \nbased on the assumption that the relationship between \u03c3yt and \u03c6p is a rule of mixtures similar \nto that shown in equation 13: \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n1st Sep 2009 \n \n 12\n( ) ( ) ( )140)1( ytppyt \u03c3\u03c6\u03c6\u03c3 \u2212=  \n  The dashed curve in Figure 5 indicates the effects of increasing void content on \u03b8b, the \nangle between the tensile axis and a line drawn normal to the plane of the shear band. The \nrelationship between pressure sensitivity and \u03b8b, which is determined by the gradient of the \nplastic potential function, is discussed in detail by Ward [74].  Because cavitation increases \npressure dependence, \u03b8b falls to zero when the void fraction reaches 0.53 [68].  This rotation \nof the band plane reduces resistance to crack tip opening; at \u03b8b = 0, yielding occurs entirely in \nresponse to tensile stresses applied normal to the bands, which in that respect resemble \ncrazes.  Good examples of craze-like cavitated shear bands have been reported by Sue [78]. \n  The problems arising in the absence of cavitation are illustrated in Figure 6, which \ncompares envelopes for pressure-dependent shear yielding under plane stress and plane strain \nloading, at KI = 1.0 MPa m0.5 in a void-free polymer blend with a tensile yield stress of 51.5 \nMPa. As noted earlier, with E = 2 GPa and \u03bd = 0.4, this corresponds to a strain energy release \nrate GI of 420 J m-2, which is sufficient to initiate crazing and crack growth in the plane strain \nregion. Since the calculations used to generate these yield envelopes do not allow for stress \nredistribution, real plastic zone sizes in a material of this type are about double those shown.  \nHowever, even when this adjustment is made, it is clear that the plane stress yield zone is not \nlarge enough to enable a standard notched Izod specimen to overcome its vulnerability to \nbrittle fracture. \n Cavitation enables the whole plastic zone, including the plane strain region, to respond \nto dilatational stresses by both expanding in volume and increasing in radius.  To achieve \nmaximum toughness, two conditions must be satisfied: extensive cavitation ahead of the \ncrack tip, and maximum involvement of the matrix in plastic deformation, which includes \nyielding, cold-drawing and strain hardening. Another important requirement, except in the \nmost robust matrix polymers (e.g. polyethylene), is full participation of the rubber phase in \nthe strain hardening mechanism; to achieve this, the rubber particle must be strongly bonded \nto the matrix and to any internal occlusions.  As discussed in Section 2.1, the extent of \ncavitation and hence the level of toughness achieved depend on particle size, degree of \ncrosslinking in the rubber phase, surface energy, and test conditions (especially temperature \nand strain rate).  To ensure that the matrix plays a full part in energy absorption, shear \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n1st Sep 2009 \n \n 13\nyielding should be the predominant deformation mechanism, and the chains must be long \nenough to avoid premature failure. Blends that depend entirely on multiple crazing for their \ntoughness do not exhibit supertough behavior. \n2.3 Crazing  \n Recent work has shown that craze initiation is a frustrated fracture process which falls \nwithin the scope of linear elastic fracture mechanics [79]; therefore the appropriate criterion \nis the Griffith equation, with slightly modified nomenclature: \n)15(\n)1( 22 aY\nGE craze\ncraze \u03bd\u03c0\u03c3 \u2212=  \nwhere \u03c3craze is the critical stress for craze initiation, Y is a geometrical factor, and Gcraze is the \nenergy absorbed in forming unit area of new craze.  Typically, in well-prepared tensile \nspecimens, \u03c3craze is between 20 and 50 MPa, and crack length a refers to a surface scratch or \ngroove no more than 0.25 \u03bcm deep [80].  It follows that Gcraze must also be small, i.e. \nbetween 0.1 and 1 J m\u22122.   This is realistic, because the critical notch-opening displacement \n\u03b4craze at craze initiation is in the range 10-20 nm, and in a linear elastic material Gcraze cannot \nbe larger than \u03c3y\u03b4craze.  \nLike microscopic surface scratches, rubber particles can be effective craze-initiation \nsites, as numerous experimental studies have shown [1, 71-72]. To act in this way, the rubber \nparticles must first cavitate to form rubber-reinforced spherical holes, in which the rubber \nprovides significant reinforcement only when it is highly strained. In LEFM, spherical voids \nare treated as penny-shaped or disc cracks [63] lying normal to the tensile direction; they \nhave a geometric factor Y = 2\/\u03c0 and crack length a = D\/2. Equation 15 then becomes: \n)16(\n)1(2 2 D\nGE craze\ncraze \u03bd\n\u03c0\u03c3 \u2212=  \n Figure 7 shows the results of calculations based on equation 16, with E = 2.8 GPa, \u03bd = \n0.4, and three different values of Gcraze.  They demonstrate that the critical stress for craze \nformation is strongly dependent on particle size.  It follows that with increasing diameter \n\u03c3craze must eventually fall below the shear yield stress of the fully-cavitated blend, which is \nindependent of D once the particles have fully cavitated.  Because it is controlled by an \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n1st Sep 2009 \n \n 14\nenergy barrier, void formation in an intact rubber particle is a thermally-activated rate \nprocess.  Consequently, void formation takes place over a period of time, beginning with \nprimary cavitation in a small fraction of larger particles, which then initiate crazes that \npropagate radially outwards, producing secondary cavitation and crazing in the particles they \nencounter. These predictions are supported by optical and transmission electron microscopy \nstudies of multiple crazing in high impact polystyrene (HIPS), ABS and other rubber \ntoughened thermoplastics [1].  Except for HIPS, which shows little sign of ductility under \ntensile loading, there is ample evidence that crazing in these blends is accompanied by \ndilatational shear yielding in Izod impact tests, and that increasing particle size tends to \npromote crazing at the expense of shear yielding. For this reason, manufacturers of ABS, \nRTPVC, and RTPMMA blends prefer to keep particle sizes well below 1 \u03bcm [56].      \n As noted earlier, multiple crazing does not necessarily lead to immediate fracture. Some \nwell-made HIPS specimens reach extensions as high as 60% by transferring stress to the \nfibrillated rubber particles. However, this stabilizing mechanism does not operate in all \n\u2018super-tough\u2019 blends. In many cases, the grafted rubber particles used to toughen polyamides \ndo not contain the rigid inclusions that are necessary for stable fibrillation of the rubber phase \nin large rubber particles. The benefits of these inclusions are demonstrated in a recent paper, \nwhich describes a novel method for producing supertough PA6 blends using quite small \namounts of polybutadiene to form thin elastomeric shells around a grafted LDPE core [81]. \nAt a concentration of 20% by weight, these grafted core-shell particles enable the blend to \nreach an impact energy of 800 J m-1, although particle sizes are approximately 1 \u03bcm, and \nparticles of this size introduced by conventional melt compounding almost invariably cause \npremature fracture.  This work demonstrates that ductile-brittle transitions are not determined \nsimply by particle size.  The way in which the deformation zone evolves after the rubber \nparticles have cavitated and initial yielding has taken place is also important.    \n To have a significant effect on fracture behavior, newly-formed crazes must first degrade \nto form true cracks. This can happen at any stage of loading, but the severity of the problem \nis reduced by partial load transfer to the rubber particles.  The best way to determine whether \nlarge rubber particles initiate craze-induced fracture before or after the material has yielded is \nto study tensile test data for blends with different particle sizes. Ideally, all blends included in \nthe study would have monodisperse particle size distributions, but that condition is extremely \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n1st Sep 2009 \n \n 15\ndifficult to achieve in extruder-compounded materials like super-tough nylons. In practice, \nextruder blends with quite small average particle sizes often contain a small percentage of \nmuch larger particles, which would be sufficient to induce premature fracture.   \n Figures 8-10 compare tensile data on two series of nylon\/rubber blends, based \nrespectively on a-PA and PA6.  Both nylons were compounded with 20% by weight of an \nethylene\/1-octene copolymer rubber (EOR), which was grafted to the polyamide using maleic \nanhydride (MA) [2, 52].  Particle sizes were adjusted by using pairs of rubbers with different \nlevels of MA grafting, and by varying processing conditions. In this way it was possible to \nproduce both monodisperse and bimodal size distributions. These studies showed that \ncorrelations between Izod impact behavior and particle size were improved by treating each \nbimodal blend as having a \u2018split personality\u2019, so that it behaves like two separate materials \nwith widely differing Dw. It is therefore appropriate to use two data points to specify the \nproperties of these blends. The same principle has been applied to the elongation data in \nFigure 10. \nEach point in Figures 8-10 represents the average of at least 5 tests on injection-molded \nbars. Almost all of the 69 materials in the original program reached the yield point. The one \nexception was an a-PA blend with Dw = 2.4 \u03bcm (the largest in the series) which had the very \nlow Izod impact strength of 70 J m-2.  Figure 8 shows that \u03c3y is almost independent of particle \nsize; statistical analysis reveals a modest rise of 1.6 MPa per decade with increasing Dw. \nYield stresses are only marginally higher for the a-PA series than for PA6 blends, despite the \nlarge difference between the neat matrix materials. A possible explanation is that cavitation \ntook place at a tensile stress of about 50 MPa in both sets of blends, since the particles have \nsimilar  properties, and that the observed yield stresses of the blends are determined by their \ncavitation stresses rather than the yield stress of the neat matrix.  The experimental scatter in \nFigure 8 is typical of blends made by melt-compounding, over which it is difficult to exercise \nstringent quality control.  \n The data are much more scattered in Figure 9, although each point represents the average \nof 5 measurements.  Elongations at break range from 50% to 200% in sets of blends that have \nalmost the same average particle size.  Plotting elongation against the fourth moment of the \nsize distribution does little to reduce the scatter, and the best interpretation that can be placed \non these results is that the lower elongations are due to large crack-initiating flaws of various \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n1st Sep 2009 \n \n 16\nsizes dispersed randomly in some batches of moldings. The most obvious source of these \nflaws is the compounding process. According to the crazing model, homogeneous rubber \nparticles larger than about 3 \u03bcm would be expected to initiate brittle fracture under the \nstresses required for cold drawing in PA6 blends, and it is difficult to ensure that no particles \nof this size are formed during a particular mixing operation. In that respect, tensile specimens \npose a harder challenge than Izod bars, because the probability of finding a critical random \nflaw is much greater along the 50 mm gage length of a tensile bar than in the small notch tip \nregion of an Izod specimen.  This principle is embodied in Weibull statistics [82]. Once the \naverage particle size exceeds ~1 \u03bcm, particles with 3 \u03bcm diameters constitute a substantial \ncomponent of the regular size distribution, and premature fracture cannot be avoided.  \nSignificantly, the blends with the largest average particle sizes have the lowest elongations. \n The results presented in Figure 10 display a more coherent pattern of behavior, perhaps \nbecause the rheological properties of a-PA melts offer better control over particle size \ndistribution. This pattern is very similar to the one shown in Figure 1: toughness reaches a \nmaximum at Dw = 0.2-0.3 \u03bcm, with DB transitions on both sides of the peak.  The new model \nfor particle size effects provides an explanation for this behavior. When Dw<0.1 \u03bcm, rates of \nprimary rubber particle cavitation are relatively low under a tensile stress of ~50 MPa  (\u03c3m = \n16.7 MPa) , and yielding is restricted to localized dilatation bands rather than extending along \nthe whole gage length.  On the other hand, when Dw>1 \u03bcm the larger particles cavitate and \ninitiate crazes, which then turn into propagating micro-cracks. Maximum toughness is \nachieved when the particles are large enough to support a reasonably high rate of strain at a \nmoderate yield stress, but not so large that they produce unstable crazes. \nCrazing was first observed in rubber-toughened nylons by Flexman [4], who reported \n\u2018craze cracks\u2019 in RTPA66 blends.  More recently, crazes have been observed in rubber-\ntoughened PA6 and a-PA blends [52]. They were initiated under impact, in 6.35 mm thick, \nsharply-notched, three-point bend specimens, using a hammer-stop to limit crack growth.  \nMultiple crazing preceded the highly cavitated shear yield zone by least 1 mm. These \nobservations confirm that the conditions for craze initiation are satisfied under plane strain \nconditions at stresses below the (constrained) shear yield stress of the 80\/20 nylon\/EOR \nblends. The formation of crazes and craze-like deformation bands in rubber-toughened semi-\ncrystalline polymers is discussed in a recent review by Cotterell et al  [83]. \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n1st Sep 2009 \n \n 17\n \n3. Discussion \nThe principles outlined above provide a quantitative basis for analyzing the effects of \nparticle size on the fracture behavior of rubber toughened thermoplastics in tests on notched \nspecimens, and hence explaining the ductile brittle transitions illustrated in Figure 1.  When \nrubber particles are very small, they require very large dilatational stresses and strains in \norder to form internal voids. Consequently, notched specimens are unable to develop a \nsubstantial yield zone before crack growth from the notch tip brings the test to an end. By \ncontrast, increasing the particle size causes a reduction in the critical volume strain for \ncavitation, thereby enabling the plastic zone to expand outward from the notch tip before \nfracture intervenes. In relatively ductile polymers (polyamides, polypropylene, PVC, etc) this \ncan eventually result in super-tough behavior, provided that the materials properties and test \nconditions are favorable.  Numerous experimental studies demonstrate that problems can \narise.  Most notably, raising the shear modulus of the rubber phase, by crosslinking, changing \nchemical composition, or simply reducing the test temperature, increases \u03b5v (cav) and reduces \nfracture resistance [26].  The energy balance model provides a sound theoretical basis for \ninterpreting these effects.  In combination with Gurson\u2019s equations for yielding in porous \nsolids, it explains why rubber-toughened polymer blends exhibit a lower DB transition.    \nHitherto, progress in understanding the upper DB transition has been much slower, \nbasically because the underlying factors responsible for brittle fracture in this region were \nunclear. The key to understanding this transition is the recently-developed LEFM model for \ncraze initiation, which provides a new perspective on the whole problem.  Supertough \nbehavior in polymer blends depends on the development of a substantial porous zone around \nthe notch tip, which does not contain unstable crazes.  One way to achieve this optimum \nresult is to avoid craze formation altogether, by keeping particle sizes small, while ensuring \nthat they are not so small that they are excessively resistant to cavitation.  On the other hand, \ncrazes are only precursors to true cracks, and an alternative possibility is to design blends in \nwhich easily-cavitated rubber particles of moderate size are able to stabilize existing crazes \nand therefore confer a certain level of toughness on the blend [81].  Very large particles are \nalmost always undesirable.    \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n1st Sep 2009 \n \n 18\nFigures 11 and 12 show how competition between the various deformation mechanisms \naffects yield stress and plastic zone size in a model RTPA6 blend. The solid line in Figure 11 \ndenotes \u03c31y, the critical value of \u03c31 at the onset of shear yield, whether before or after \ncavitation.  Under plane strain loading, the stresses (\u03c31, \u03c32, \u03c33) take the form (\u03c3, \u03c3, 2\u03bd\u03c3) on \nthe crack plane. This enables the critical stresses for cavitation, shear yielding and craze \ninitiation to be compared directly by means of a two-dimensional plot of \u03c31crit against log(D), \nalthough cavitation is controlled by the mean stress, shear yielding is governed by the \npressure-modified effective stress, and craze initiation is determined by the applied tensile \nstress. The cavitation stress curve in this figure is derived from the fitted line in Figure 2, and \nthe craze initiation curve is similar to those shown in Figure 7, with Gcraze = 0.2 J m-2.  \nBecause of the complexity of the interactions between competing micro-mechanisms, no \nattempt has been made to estimate the yield stress for a combination of crazing and shear \nyielding.   \nThe highest calculated value of \u03c31y is 108 MPa.  Figure 4 shows that shear yielding takes \nplace in the void-free RTPA6 model blend when the stress on the crack plane reaches (108, \n108, 87) MPa.  Since cavitation stresses are higher than this when the particles are very small, \nfull constraint is maintained all the way to the point at which a crack initiates from the notch \ntip.  Therefore in blends with D>0.03 \u03bcm brittle fracture occurs with minimum energy \ndissipation, KIC is low (~ 1 MPa m0.5) and rp is <0.03 mm. By contrast, increasing the particle \nsize above 0.03 \u03bcm enables the blend to cavitate before fracture intervenes, thereby causing a \nreduction in \u03c31y, the principal stress at yield on the crack plane, which eventually falls to 55.8 \nMPa at D = 0.078 \u03bcm.  At larger values of D, the cavitation stress falls below the shear yield \nstress of the fully-cavitated blend, and the plane-strain shear yield stress is no longer a \nfunction of particle size.  This is the super-tough region, with KI  exceeding 3.5 MPa m0.5, and \nplastic zone sizes of at least 1.0 mm. Dilatational shear yielding remains the dominating \ndeformation mechanism until the onset of the ductile-brittle transition at D = DDBo = 0.35 \u03bcm, \nwhich occurs when the craze initiation curve crosses the shear-yield line.   \nBeyond this point, craze-induced brittle fracture becomes a possibility, and the extent of \ncrack tip yielding prior to fracture is minimized.  The location of this transition can be \ncalculated by rearranging equation 16, as follows: \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n1st Sep 2009 \n \n 19\n)17(\n)1(2 22 ycav\ncraze\nDBo\nGED \u03c3\u03bd\n\u03c0\n\u2212=  \nwhere \u03c3ycav is the yield stress of the fully cavitated blend (56 MPa in Figure 11).  This \nequation explains in general terms why Wu observed a shift in the critical particle size when \nhe increased the rubber content of his PA66 blends from 10% to 25%. Adding rubber causes \nboth Young\u2019s modulus and yield stress to fall, but the yield behavior of the blend is \ndominated by the decrease in \u03c3ycav, which shifts DDBo upwards. \nFigure 12 shows the relationship between D and rp, calculated using equation 3 with data \non \u03c31y taken from Figure 11.  Irwin\u2019s correction has been applied in all cases to allow for \nstress redistribution [66].  As the data do not extend beyond D = 0.35 \u03bcm, the reduction in \ntoughness observed at larger particle sizes is represented by dotted lines which are at best \napproximations to the plastic zone sizes seen in fracture mechanics specimens.        \nIt should be noted that the calculations used in preparing the Figures 11 and 12 are based \non hypothetical blends with very narrow distributions of particle size, deforming under \nisothermal conditions.   Polydispersity introduces additional complications, which have been \ndiscussed briefly in previous sections, and adiabatic energy dissipation is an important issue \nin notched impact tests on supertough blends. For purposes of illustration, the calculations are \nbased on a particular 80\/20 PA6\/rubber blend with specific properties, measured at room \ntemperature under low rates of strain. However, charts similar to Figures 11 and 12 could be \ngenerated to represent other test conditions and materials properties; the permutations are \nendless.   \nAnother limitation of the illustrations is that they define the boundaries between linear \nelastic behavior and inelastic responses at an early stage in the fracture test.  This simplified \napproach identifies conditions for the onset of the three main deformation micro-mechanisms, \nbut is unable to determine in any detail how the deformation zone subsequently develops.  \nThe insights obtained in this way are valuable, but much remains to be done; the principles \nset out in this introductory paper open up the subject to further exploration.  Later papers in \nthis series will address other aspects of particle size dependence in rubber-toughened \nthermoplastics.  The most obvious issues are the effects of rubber content, test temperature, \nstrain rate, and materials properties. Looking a little further afield, a similar LEFM-based \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n1st Sep 2009 \n \n 20\napproach to DB transitions can be applied to blends containing mineral filler particles, which \nform voids by debonding, and to rubber toughened thermosetting resins, in which large \ncavitated particles form microcracks rather than crazes. \nAs noted earlier, another topic to be addressed is the response of notched Izod specimens \nduring the later stages of the test, well beyond the onset of dilatational yielding or crazing. \nInitial events are extremely important in determining the subsequent behavior of the \nspecimen, but in very tough blends most of the energy is absorbed during notch tip blunting \nand crack propagation, where non-isothermal deformation is known to affect energy \nabsorption [84-90].   \n  On a more fundamental level, this paper raises basic questions about the susceptibility \nof different thermoplastics to craze initiation, which can now be seen to depend on the value \nof Gcraze.  Studies by Vincent [91] and more recently by Wool [92] show that the strength of a \nthermoplastic is ultimately dependent on the cross-sectional area of its chains.  Thus the \nLEFM model for craze initiation establishes a link between chemical structure and DB \ntransitions in polymer blends, which deserves further exploration.   \n4. Conclusions \nThis paper introduces a new model for deformation, yield and fracture of polymer blends \nin the plane strain region close to a notch tip, which overcomes the deficiencies of the inter-\nparticle approach advocated by Wu [5-6].  It employs linear elastic fracture mechanics in \ncombination with earlier models for rubber particle cavitation, shear yielding and craze \ninitiation to determine the order in which these mechanisms are activated when a notched \nspecimen is loaded, and to map their spread from the notch tip. Calculations for a specific \n80\/20 nylon\/rubber blend show that when the rubber particles have very small diameters (D \n<0.03 \u03bcm) they are unable to cavitate because the critical stress for cavitation lies above the \n(constrained) shear yield stress of the blend, which is itself extremely high.  It is possible that \na minute shear yield zone is formed, but the stresses in this zone are so high that the essential \nfailure mechanism is craze initiation and brittle fracture from the notch tip. By contrast, \nincreasing D above about 0.03 \u03bcm enables the particles to cavitate before the material yields, \nand consequently reduces the shear yield stress, which at this stage is a function of the \nvolume fraction of cavitated particles. Over a size range running approximately from 0.03 \u03bcm \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n1st Sep 2009 \n \n 21\nto 0.08 \u03bcm, the shear yield stress is controlled by the cavitation stress, and increasing D \nproduces a continuous decrease in \u03c31y, which leads to a rapid increase in toughness. \nEventually, the cavitation stress falls below the shear yield stress of the fully-cavitated blend, \nand toughness reaches a maximum. \n A less desirable result of increasing particle size is that it reduces the critical stress for \ncraze initiation, because large cavitated particles act as very effective Griffith flaws.  \nFormation and subsequent failure of crazes causes fracture of the yield zone before it has \nfully developed.  If the particles are very large (e.g. D>10 \u03bcm) and \u03c3craze << \u03c31y, the extent of \nshear yielding will be minimal, and brittle fracture will ensue.  If on the other hand \u03c3craze is \nquite close to \u03c31y, a more likely outcome is extensive shear yielding with some associated \ncrazing, followed by premature fracture at reduced elongation. Under these conditions, the \ncritical notch-tip opening displacement is only slightly lower than the optimum, and there is \nonly a modest reduction in energy to break. \n For purposes of illustration, calculations presented in this paper relate to a series of \nblends with very narrow distributions of particle size, which have tensile yield stresses of \nabout 50 MPa, and other mechanical properties as listed in the text.  The properties chosen \ncorrespond roughly with those of PA6\/rubber blends with a volume ratio of 74\/26 (weight \nratio 80\/20), measured at room temperature and at a low strain rate. The ductile-brittle \ntransitions represented in Figures 11 and 12 were obtained by inserting these specific data \ninto the relevant equations of the model, and their locations will obviously shift if different \ndata are used.  It follows that DB transitions would be expected to vary with rubber content, \nas observed by Wu [5-6], with temperature, as reported by Borggreve et al [8], and with \nstrain rate. Later papers in this series will explore these and other factors affecting DB \ntransitions in polymer blends.    \nAcknowledgment \nThe authors dedicate this paper to the memory of their friend and colleague, Dr. Henno \nKeskkula, who had a long-lasting interest in the issues addressed in this study. \n \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n1st Sep 2009 \n \n 22\n \nReferences  \n1.

Dotted lines are estimates based very roughly on observed reductions in \nfracture resistance of notched specimens.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n5th September 2009 \n \nWeight Average Particle Diameter Dw (\u03bcm)\n0.01 0.1 1 10\nN\not\nch\ned\n Iz\nod\n Im\npa\nct\n E\nne\nrg\ny \n (J\n\/m\n)\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n1200\na                                                                           e     \nc\nb                           d\n \n \n \nFigure  1 \n \nParticle Size  D (\u03bcm)\n0.01 0.1 1 10\nC\nrit\nic\nal\n V\nol\num\ne \nS\ntra\nin\n  \u03b5 v\n(c\nav\n) (\n%\n)\n0.01\n0.1\n1\n10\nC\nrit\nic\nal\n M\nea\nn \nSt\nre\nss\n  \u03c3\nm\n(c\nav\n) (\nM\nP\na)\n1\n10\n100\n1000\npredicted assuming \n        negligible energy barrier\nline fitted to \n       experimental data\n \n \n \nFigure 2 \n \n \n \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n5th September 2009 \n \nx (mm)\n-0.6 -0.4 -0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\ny \n(m\nm\n)\n-0.6\n-0.4\n-0.2\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.1    0.2    0.3    0.4      0.5 \u03bcm   =  D crack\ncavitation zone\n  KI = 1.0 MPa m0.5\n \nFigure 3 \n \n \nMean Stress \u03c3m (MPa)\n0 20 40 60 80 100\nEf\nfe\nct\niv\ne \nSt\nre\nss\n a\nt Y\nie\nld\n  \u03c3\ney\n (M\nPa\n)\n0\n20\n40\n60\nvol fraction of voids \u03c6 = 0.265\npressure modified \n       von Mises: equation 7\npressure modified\n   Gurson: equation 11\nplane \nstrain\n \u03b8 = 0\nbi\nax\nia\nl te\nns\nion\nun\nia\nxi\nal\n te\nns\nio\nn\n \n \n \nFigure  4 \n \n \n \n \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n5th September 2009 \n \nVolume Fraction of Inclusions \u03c6\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8\nBa\nnd\n A\nng\nle\n \u03b8 \n(d\neg\nre\nes\n)\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\nTe\nns\nile\n Y\nie\nld\n  S\ntre\nss\n \u03c3 y\nt (\nM\nP\na)\n  \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\nBand Angle \nTensile Yield Stress \nvoids or cavitated\nparticles:\nequation 11\nsolid rubber particles:\nequation 14\nRTPA6\n      data\n\u03b8\ncrack plane\nban\nd p\nlan\ne\n \n \nFigure 5 \n \n \nx (\u03bcm)\n-100 -50 0 50 100 150\ny \n(\u03bc m\n)\n-100\n-80\n-60\n-40\n-20\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\ncrack\nplane         plane\nstrain        stress\npressure-modified\nvon Mises envelopes\nKI = 1.0 MPa\nno cavitation\n \n \nFigure 6 \n \n \n \n \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n5th September 2009 \n \n \n \nParticle Diameter D (\u03bcm)\n0.01 0.1 1 10\nC\nra\nzi\nng\n S\ntre\nss\n \u03c3 c\nra\nze\n (M\nP\na)\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n  Gcraze  =     0.1         0.3           1.0    J\/m\n2\ncraze initiation\n \nFigure 7 \n \n \nWeight Average Particle Size Dw (\u03bcm)\n0.01 0.1 1 10\nTe\nns\nile\n Y\nie\nld\n S\ntre\nss\n  \u03c3\nyt\n  (\nM\nP\na)\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\na-PA\/EOR\nPA6\/EOR\na-PA\nPA6\n \n \n Figure 8 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n5th September 2009 \n \n \nWeight Average Particle Size Dw (\u03bcm)\n0.01 0.1 1 10\nE\nlo\nng\nat\nio\nn \nat\n B\nre\nak\n (%\n)\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n80\/20 PA6\/EOR blends\nPA6\n \nFigure 9 \nWeight Average Particle Size  Dw (\u03bcm)\n0.01 0.1 1 10\nE\nlo\nng\nat\nio\nn \nat\n B\nre\nak\n (%\n)\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200 80\/20 a-PA\/EOR\na-PA\n \n \nFigure 10 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n5th September 2009 \n \n \nParticle Diameter D (\u03bcm)\n0.01 0.1 1 10\nC\nrit\nic\nal\n T\nen\nsi\nle\n S\ntre\nss\n \u03c3 I\nC\n (M\nPa\n)\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140 on crack plane in\nplane strain zone\n \nyielding\nwithout \ncavitation\nshear\n  yielding\n   with \n    cavitation\ncrazing before \ncavitation\nNO CAVITATION CRAZING\nCAVITATION\nstress\nstate \n(MPa)\n108, 108. 86\n56, 56, 45\n \n \n \nFigure 11 \nParticle Diameter D (\u03bcm)\n0.01 0.1 1 10\nP\nla\nst\nic\n Z\non\ne \nR\nad\niu\ns \nr p\n (m\nm\n)\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\n1.8\nKI (MPa m\n0.5)\n3.5\n2.5\n1.0\nzone radius \nlimited by\ncrazing\nresistance\nto \ncavitation\n \n \nFigure12 \n \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n5th September 2009 \n \nParticle Diameter (\u03bcm)\n0.01 0.1 1 10\nN\not\nch\ned\n Iz\nod\n Im\npa\nct\n E\nne\nrg\ny \n (J\n\/m\n)\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n1200\nparticles resistant \nto cavitation\ncavitation with\nshear yielding\nonset of \ncraze initiation\n \nTable of Content Graphic \n \n"}
