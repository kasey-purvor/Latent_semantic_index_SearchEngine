These are explored through examples from \nprofessional misconduct cases in social care and accounts from professional \npractitioners about their working lives. Key elements of professional integrity are \nidentified and implications for policy, practice and education are considered.  \n \n \nKey words: professional integrity, codes of conduct, professional values, virtue \nethics \n \nIntroduction \n \n\u201eProfessional integrity\u201f is becoming increasingly topical. I was first prompted to start \nthinking about this concept when analysing a series of interviews conducted in 2001 \nin England with senior practitioners in the social welfare field (social, community and \nyouth workers) about their ethical dilemmas and problems. Further details of these \ninterviews, and an analysis of the impact of aspects of new accountability regimes \nand inter-professional working on professional autonomy and ethical practice, can be \nfound in Banks (2004a). I was struck by the accounts that a few practitioners gave of \ntheir commitment to hold on to a set of deeply-held professional values in the face of \nadversity or pressure. At this time the term \u201eintegrity\u201f was not in common usage in \nthe professional literature. It did not feature in the British Association of Social \nWorkers\u201f Code of Ethics  (British Association of Social Workers, 1996), it was not \n 3 \nprominent in textbooks on social work ethics (for example, Reamer, 1999; Clark, \n2000; Banks, 2001) and none of the practitioners I interviewed actually used the \nterms \u201eintegrity\u201f or \u201eprofessional integrity\u201f.  \n \nIn an earlier paper I wrote on this theme (Banks, 2004b), I started with a quotation \nfrom an American philosopher, Robert Solomon (1997, p. 215), who had made the \nfollowing comment: \u201e\u201cIntegrity\u201d is a word like \u201chonor\u201d \u2013 its close kin \u2013 that sometimes \nseems all but archaic in the modern business world\u201f. Although Solomon was writing \nabout business, I argued that his comment could equally well apply to modern public \nservices. One significant exception in a British context, however, was the Nolan \nprinciples relating to standards in public life, which included \u201eintegrity\u201f as one of the \nseven principles (Nolan Committee, 1996). The establishing of these principles was \nstimulated by a series of scandals, particularly over the private financial interests of \nBritish Members of Parliament. This marks, perhaps, the beginning of the revival of \nthe use of the term \u201eintegrity\u201f in the context of a growing concern with misconduct, \nmalpractice and a demand for minimum standards of good practice in public and \nprofessional services. Well over a decade after Solomon made this comment about \nintegrity, far from being \u201earchaic\u201f, the term \u201eintegrity\u201f is becoming commonplace in \nprofessional codes and guidance on conduct and came to the fore again in 2009 in \nthe wake of scandals in the British Parliament about Members\u201f expenses. \n \nThe term \u201eintegrity\u201f made an appearance in the revised BASW code of ethics (British \nAssociation of Social Workers, 2002), clearly drawing on the wording of the earlier \nAustralian and USA documents (National Association of Social Workers, 1999; \nAustralian Association of Social Workers, 2000). It features in the latest version of \nthe Nursing and Midwifery code (Nursing and Midwifery Council, 2008), whilst being \nabsent from the 2002 version (Nursing and Midwifery Council, 2002). The term \n\u201eintegrity\u201f is much more frequently used in the health and scientific fields generally. \nFor example, there is now a UK Research Integrity Office that carries out work on \nbehalf of the UK Panel for Research Integrity in Health and Biomedical Sciences, set \nup in 2006 to provide guidance on dealing with research misconduct (see \nhttp:\/\/www.ukrio.org). A national Office for Research Integrity covering public health \nresearch in the USA has existed since the mid-1990s (see http:\/\/ori.dhhs.gov) and \nthe term \u201eresearch integrity\u201f is in frequent use in a university context. \n 4 \n \nConsideration of the topic of professional integrity is also highly topical in social \nwork, particularly in the context of the relatively new system of regulation of \nprofessional conduct introduced in England from 2005 overseen by the General \nSocial Care Council (GSCC), the body that registers and regulates social care \nworkers. The term \u201eintegrity\u201f does not appear in the GSCC codes of practice \n(General Social Care Council, 2002) or the report of the registration and regulation \nprocess, which includes details of the conduct hearings (General Social Care \nCouncil, 2008). However, these documents and processses are clearly concerned \nwith the same concepts, principles and behaviour that are categorised as \u201eintegrity\u201f in \nthe BASW and NMC codes. Over one third of the conduct cases heard by the GSCC \nsince its inception are reported as relating to \u201ecrossing professional boundaries and \ninappropriate relationships with people who use services\u201f (General Social Care \nCouncil, 2008, p. 8). Some of these cases involved social workers developing \nintimate relationships with service users.    \n \nThe concept of integrity embodied in these recent uses of the term in the context of \nprofessional practice and public service focuses on integrity as conduct that meets \ncommonly accepted standards. This is somewhat different from the construction of \nprofessional integrity in which I had become interested, based on the accounts given \nin interviews with social welfare practitioners. That version of professional integrity \nwas about maintaining and acting upon a deeply held set of values, often in a hostile \nclimate. This is exemplified by the narrative of a Youth Offending Team Manager, \nwho reported that he had left his job because he was unable to offer young people \nthe care and respect he felt they needed and deserved (my italics):  \n \nI couldn\u2019t be part of that you know \u2026 First hand experiences really kind of \nchallenged my own sort of position, and my own thinking\u2026 I think anybody \nwho cares about people and who sees that, and who comes up against the \nbrick walls, you know, on a daily basis, you can only take so much really, as \none person.  \n \nThis brief overview of the use of the concept suggests that professional integrity is \ncomplex and contested, with several meanings that would bear further examination. I \n 5 \nwill now explore the concept of \u201eprofessional integrity\u201f further, taking account of some \nof the relevant philosophical literature on integrity (there is little specifically on \n\u201eprofessional integrity\u201f per se), along with a more detailed analysis of professional \ncodes and reports of the social care conduct hearings. \n    \nWhat is \u2018integrity\u2019? \n \nThe term \u201eintegrity\u201f is derived from the Latin \u201eintegritas\u201f, which means having no part \ntaken away, that is, being in a state of completeness or wholeness. Integrity may be \ncreated through an act of unification of various aspects or parts, or it may be \nmaintained or preserved. We often use the term to describe a quality of a person, \naction or object, such as a \u201ewoman of integrity\u201f, \u201ean act of integrity\u201f, \u201ethe integrity of a \nroom and its furniture\u201f. In this article I am concerned with integrity in relation to \npeople and actions. In particular, I am interested in moral integrity \u2013 as distinct from \nother types of integrity that may not necessarily have a normative or moral content, \nsuch as intellectual integrity, artistic integrity or bodily integrity (de Raeve, 1997). \nFrequently when the term \u201eintegrity\u201f is used in relation to people and actions, it is \n\u201emoral integrity\u201f that is meant. In the context of public life, integrity (with its \nconnotations of wholeness) is often presented as the opposite of corruption (with its \nconnotations of distortion, decay or breakup). \n \nWhat is professional integrity? \n \nWhilst there is a small body of literature in moral philosophy on integrity, some of \nwhich considers professional integrity, there is much less on professional integrity \nper se. In exploring the nature of professional integrity, therefore, I will draw on some \nof the philosophical literature on the generic concept of integrity as well as some of \nthe professional literature and practice guidance on ethics to develop ideas about \nprofessional integrity. Within this literature, it is possible to identify and develop at \nleast three versions of \u201eprofessional integrity\u201f as:  \n \n1. Morally good\/right conduct, according to accepted professional \nguidelines\/codes of ethics. Cox, et al. (2003) call this \u201eprofessionalism\u201f.  \nEssentially this version focuses on conduct. \n 6 \n2. \u2018Standing for something\u2019 (Calhoun, 1995). Applied to professional life, this \nversion of integrity entails practitioners being committed to sets of professional \nideals\/principles, which may go beyond extant professional norms. Williams \n(1973), speaking about integrity generally, refers to \u201eidentity-conferring \ncommitments\u201f adhered to over the course of a life. Essentially this version \nfocuses on commitment. \n3. A capacity\/moral competence. This can be described as a process of \ncontinuous reflexive sense-making (Cox et al., 2003), which may even involve re-\nevaluating and giving up previously held ideals and principles (Walker, 2007).  \nThis version of integrity is can easily be applied to integrity in professional life and \nessentially focuses on capacity. \n \nI will now examine each of these versions of professional integrity in turn. \n \n1. Professional integrity as right conduct \n \nThe term \u201eprofessional integrity\u201f is often used to refer to conduct in carrying out a \nwork role that is in accordance with commonly accepted general principles of the \nprofession and the specific codes\/guidance produced by professional bodies. Cox et \nal. (2003, p. 103) have characterised this as \u201eprofessionalism\u201f rather than \n\u201eprofessional integrity\u201f in so far as it amounts to \u201epursuing the extant demands of the \nprofession\u201f. For example, this might involve sticking with the commonly accepted \nstandards of confidentiality in the social work profession in a context where a \nnewspaper is seeking details of a family where suspected child abuse has taken \nplace. \n \nThis view of professional integrity as being essentially the same as professionalism \nis not uncommon in the context of many professions. As mentioned earlier, in \nbiomedical and health research, a UK Panel for Research Integrity was set up in \n2006 to offer advice and guidance regarding misconduct in research.  Here the term \n\u201eresearch integrity\u201f is used to refer to conduct in accordance with the commonly \naccepted standards of scientific experimentation and reporting expected in the \nacademic community. In 2005 a group of research-intensive universities in the UK \nlaunched a code of practice for \u201eresearch integrity\u201f, covering matters such as \n 7 \nintellectual property rights, plagiarism and falsification of research results. This code \nwas said to be designed \u201eto prove their professionalism\u201f (Davis, 2005, p. 3).  \n \nCodes \n \n\u201eIntegrity\u201f, is a key value in many social work codes of ethics. According to the BASW \n(2002) code: \n \nIntegrity comprises honesty, reliability, openness and impartiality, and is an \nessential value in the practice of social work.  \n \nThe statement produced by the National Association of Social Workers (1999) in the \nUSA sums up integrity as follows: \n \nSocial workers are continually aware of the profession's mission, values, \nethical principles, and ethical standards and practice in a manner consistent \nwith them. Social workers act honestly and responsibly and promote ethical \npractices on the part of the organizations with which they are affiliated.  \n \nThe focus is on the actions of the social worker as a professional. This statement \nsuggests that professionals need to be aware of the totality of the aims, values and \nrules of the profession, ensuring that their actions are consistent with these norms. \nThis means seeing the profession as a coherent whole and behaving in accordance \nwith this professional framework. This particular statement implies that the \nprofessional framework is given and social workers need to be aware of it all the \ntime. It does not present social workers as actively owning, reflecting on, questioning \nor contributing to the development and revision of the profession\u201fs values. This does \nnot mean that this does not happen, that it is not valued, or that the importance of \nreflection does not appear elsewhere in the NASW code, just that this is not part of \nthe description of \u201eintegrity\u201f given in the  code. In addition to acting in accordance \nwith the specific normative content of the professional ethical framework, social \nworkers are said to act honestly and responsibly. Honesty is a quality frequently \nassociated with integrity (McFall, 1987). The British Association of Social Workers\u201f \ncode (BASW, 2002, para 3.4.2) elaborates a set of principles under the heading of \n 8 \nintegrity, which includes social workers being honest about their qualifications and \ncompetence, not using professional relationships for personal gain and not engaging \nin intimate or sexual conduct with service users.  \n \nEssentially such codes of ethics and practice outline what kinds of people good \nprofessionals should be and how they should act. If professionals contravene the \ncode of good conduct (for example, if social workers engage in sexual relationships \nwith service users, or researchers falsify research results) then this damages their \nintegrity (wholeness) as good professionals and damages the profession itself.  \nDeveloping a sexual relationship with a service user, for example, is not seen just as \na mistake, or an isolated example of bad practice that can be compensated for by \ngood practice in other areas. It is simply not what professional social workers do. \nPeople who do this damage their integrity as social workers.  Furthermore, they will \nalmost certainly be struck off the professional register, as recent cases dealt with by \nthe GSCC (2008) indicate. \n \nConduct hearings \n \nThe first report of the General Social Care Council (GSCC, 2008) outlining the \nnumber and nature of the conduct cases considered between April 2005 and 31 \nMarch 2008 was published in September 2008. Although \u201eintegrity\u201f is not mentioned \nin the GSCC codes (2002) used as the basis for the conduct hearings, section 5 of \nthe code for social care workers is in effect about professional integrity: \u201eAs a social \ncare worker you must uphold public trust and confidence in social care services\u201f. \nSpecific clauses under this heading include prohibitions on harming, neglecting, \nexploiting, abusing or discriminating against service users, carers or colleagues and \non forming inappropriate relationships with service users. Of 49 cases heard, the \ncouncil reports that 21 involved allegations of inappropriate relationships. The areas \nof the code most commonly breached related to trust and confidence of people who \nuse services and the public. Cases heard by the GSCC included a male social \nworker who was removed from the professional register for having had sexual \nrelationships with two vulnerable users of services, and a female social worker who \nwas suspended for six months for having formed a personal relationship with the \nfather of a child with whom she was working. In one of the early cases, the GSCC \n 9 \nconduct committee suspended a social worker from the register for advertising \nherself as an escort. The grounds for this included the fact that she had: \n \nbrought the profession into disrepute and damaged public confidence in social \ncare services\u2026 Social workers have a duty to act appropriately and \nprofessionally both inside and outside work\u2026it is essential that service users \ncan trust them. (General Social Care Council, 2006) \n \nIntegrity as morally good conduct is essentially about adhering to minimum \nstandards accepted in the profession. This is exemplified in a GSSC misconduct \ncase I observed in 2008. The case concerned a social worker accused of using \nexcessive force with a resident in a local authority residential home. The panel was \nconcerned to establish whether the worker knew about the commonly accepted \nstandards for physical handling in the home and in the local authority more widely.   \n  \n \n2. Professional integrity as commitment \n \nThe second version of professional integrity draws on philosophers\u201f accounts of the \nnature of integrity. Bernard Williams (1973; 1981) speaks of integrity as holding \nsteadfastly true to certain identity-conferring commitments or ground projects. He \nargues that these \u201ecommitments\u201f are projects with which people are deeply and \nextensively involved and identified. Abandoning these projects would mean losing \ntouch with what gives their lives an identity. Such commitments might include \nsupporting a cause (for example, Zionism or the abolition of chemical and biological \nwarfare) or they may be projects that flow from a more general disposition such as \nhatred of injustice, cruelty or killing (Williams, 1973, p. 111). This involves people \nacting from motives, interests and commitments that are most deeply their own.   \n \nIf we apply this in a professional context, then commitment to working for social \njustice as a social worker might be regarded as a \u201eground project\u201f. In professional \ncontexts, however, the identity-conferring commitments are broader than just \nindividual projects. According to Calhoun (1995), integrity involves \u201estanding for \nsomething\u201f that is personally endorsed by the moral agent, but this is in a social \n 10 \ncontext that provides a broader reference point for evaluating the worth of the \nprojects\/commitments.  Calhoun argues that persons of integrity do not just act \nconsistently with what they personally endorse, they stand up for their best \njudgement within a community of people trying to discover what in life is worth doing. \nIntegrity is a matter of having proper regard for one\u201fs role in a community process of \ndeliberation over what is valuable and what is worth doing. This entails not only \nstanding up, unhypocritically, for one\u201fs best judgement, but also that one has proper \nrespect for the judgement of others. Calhoun characterises integrity as a \u201esocial \nvirtue\u201f, that is, a quality of character or disposition to act well in the context of a moral \ncommunity.  \n \nThis can be illustrated by the story of Jane, the manager of a child protection team in \nan English local authority Social Services Department (now Children\u201fs Services), \nsummarised from two in-depth interviews with her about her work. Jane gives a view \nof why she came into social work and uses this as a standard against which to \nmeasure some of the current practices with which she has to engage. \n \nJane\u2019s case: \u2018It\u2019s not why I came into social work.\u2019  \n______________________________________________________________ \n \nJane started doing voluntary work in a social services setting, then took a \nprofessional qualification and started working with older people in a local authority \nsocial services department. She commented:  \n \nI\u2019d always wanted to work with older people. And those first few years, I \ncouldn\u201ft believe I was being paid for it! You know, I was driving round [name \nof city], doing bits of social history really. \n \nShe became interested in mental health during her work with older people and \nqualified as an approved mental health social worker, moving to work in the mental \nhealth field.  She explained her move into mental health in the context of how the \nchanges that were brought in as a result of the 1990 Community Care Act changed \nthe nature of her work with older people: \n \n 11 \nI was very disillusioned with the community care legislation that came in, \nwhich I felt very much changed the process of what we were doing, and got \nquite upset about that really, as did many of my colleagues. Some of them \nhad stuck with it and learned to live with it, or whatever you do. But I didn\u2019t \nfeel it gave me the capacity to do the job properly, and I didn\u201ft want to go and \nsee somebody who wanted a day centre place and ask if they could change a \nlight bulb, you know.  \n \nShe described her work with the mental health team as challenging and stimulating \u2013 \nvaluing her colleagues and commenting how much autonomy and responsibility they \nhad. After several years she moved into child care as a team manager. This move \ncame about due to staff shortages and the need for an acting team manager, a post \nthat she was persuaded to take temporarily, which then became permanent. She has \ndeveloped the team and is very committed to doing a good job. She described one of \nthe changes taking place in the social services department that she felt was \nimpacting on her work. This was a plan to provide all placements for children who \nneeded to be looked after by the local authority \u201ein house\u201f rather than buying places \nfrom providers across the country.  The in-house provision had not yet been \ndeveloped, but nevertheless all \u201eout of town\u201f placements were being stringently \nreviewed, particularly in terms of cost. Jane illustrated what this meant for her: \n \nWhat I've spent the last three weeks in, is actually bartering over a residential \nplacement with [placement provider] and saying \u201ewell, if we pay that much \nmore, will you do that much more?\u201f And it's not why I came into social work, I \ncan\u2019t believe I\u2019m doing it, and you know, these changes are so insidious \nreally, that you suddenly think, \u201ewhat am I doing, talking about a child\u201fs \nwelfare in terms of how much it\u201fs costing?\u201f \u2026 It\u201fs not about what\u201fs best for the \nchild. That\u2019s quite difficult to live with, and it\u2019s difficult for social workers to live \nwith. It\u201fs hard to put a price on kids\u201f heads really. And that\u201fs happening more \nand more.  \n______________________________________________________________ \n   \nJane\u201fs story is probably a fairly typical one in that she started doing voluntary caring \nwork and then moved into professional social work in order to do a job that she \n 12 \nenjoyed and thought worthwhile (\u201eI always wanted to work with older people\u201f). She \nhas a view of why she came into social work and uses this as a yardstick against \nwhich to measure some of the current practices with which she has to engage. Her \ntalk of \u201edisillusionment\u201f with the results of the community care legislation implies that \nshe does have a vision of what she could do as a good social worker and wants to \ncarry on being able to live up to this (hence the change of job). This is further \nexemplified when she says, in relation to the intense focus on the cost of children\u201fs \nplacements: \u201eIt\u201fs not why I came into social work\u201f.  In saying \u201eI can\u201ft believe I\u201fm doing \nit\u201f she is, in effect, standing back and reflecting on her role and her actions. She is \nimplying that this does not fit with her self-image: \u201eThat\u201fs quite difficult to live with\u201f. \nShe also adds: \u201eIt\u201fs difficult for social workers to live with\u201f, reinforcing her vision of a \ngood social worker as someone who does not put financial costs before children\u201fs \nwelfare.  \n \nJane can be seen as someone who has a vision of good social work and of herself \nas a good social worker and it is on the basis of this vision that she does the job. She \nhas taken action during her career to maintain this vision through changing work \nsettings. She shows herself in her talk to be working at maintaining her integrity \nthrough critically reflecting on her past and current roles. This begins to take us \ntowards the third version of professional integrity, which focuses not just on a \nperson\u201fs commitment or motivation, but on their character and competence, \nincluding an ability to engage in reflexive sense-making, which I will explore under \nthe heading of \u201ecapacity\u201f.   \n \n3. Professional integrity as a capacity \n \nCharacter \n \nCox et al (2003; 2005, p. 9) suggest that the concept of integrity may be better \nconceived as a \u201ecluster concept\u201f that ties together different overlapping qualities of \ncharacter. They argue that integrity is a virtue (that is a quality of character), but it is \nnot reducible to the workings of a single moral capacity (in the way courage is, for \nexample) or the wholehearted pursuit of a clear moral end (like benevolence). They \ncharacterise \u201eintegrity\u201f as a \u201ecomplex and thick virtue term\u201f. They use the Aristotelian \n 13 \ncharacterisation of virtue as a mean between two excesses (although Aristotle \nhimself does not discuss integrity as a virtue in this way). They suggest that it stands \nbetween the qualities associated with inflexibility such as arrogance, rigidity, \ndogmatism, sanctimoniousness and those associated with superficiality and \nartificiality, such as capriciousness, weakness of will, self-deception and hypocrisy.  \nThe person of integrity, they suggest, \u201elives in a fragile balance between every one of \nthese all-too-human traits\u201f (Cox et al., 2003, p. 41). They argue for an account of \nintegrity as \u201ea capacity to respond to change in one\u201fs values or circumstances, a kind \nof continual remaking of the self, as well as a capacity to balance responsibility for \none\u201fs work and thought.\u201f (Cox et al., 2003, p. 41). This is a much more dynamic \naccount, which does not require a concept of an unchanging self or rigid identity, \nwhich the version of integrity as commitment might imply.  \n \nCompetence  \n \nOn the above account, to be a person of integrity entails having a capacity to do the \nwork necessary to sustain one\u201fs fragile self. Cox et al. (2003) talk of the capacity to \nrespond to change and a continual remaking of the self. This has resonances with \nWalker\u201fs (2007) characterisation of integrity as \u201ereliable accountability\u201f, requiring a \nkind of moral competence in resolving conflicts and priorities, readjusting ideals and \ncompromising principles. This is part of Walker\u201fs \u201eexpressive-collaborative\u201f approach \nto ethics, which regards the story as the basic form of representation for moral \nproblems (Walker, 2007, p. 116). Within this, integrity can be regarded as a kind of \nreliable accountability that we construct in the stories we tell about our relationships, \nidentities and values. Stories are reworked and revised and help us to see \u201esense-\nmaking connections [that] serve to bundle up varied or repeating actions into legible \nconfigurations, such as neglecting a friendship or trying to disown a past\u201f (Walker, \n2007, p. 117). Walker argues that the point of integrity is \u201eto maintain \u2013 or reestablish \n\u2013 our reliability in matters involving important commitments and goods\u201f (Walker, \n2007, p. 113). It is based on the assumption that human lives are changing and are \ndeeply entangled with others.  We are often seeking, therefore, a local dependability \n(rather than global wholeness) and a responsiveness to the moral costs of error and \nchange rather than consistency.  \n \n 14 \nThis approach to integrity as a kind of moral competence or capacity usefully \nextends its characterisation as a thick and complex virtue and enables us more \neasily to undertake empirical explorations of integrity.   \n \nThe following example from an emergency duty social worker employed by an \nEnglish local authority depicts him reflecting on his role and making sense of it in \nrelation to an ideal of what good social work should be. \n \nJim\u2019s case:  \u2018It's not the right way to be doing it.\u2019 \n \n \nJim qualified as a social worker 15 years ago and worked in a variety of settings \nbefore taking on the post of emergency duty social worker for a local authority three \nyears ago. He works evenings and weekends and takes urgent cases covering the \nwhole of a large rural county. He is on duty on his own and deals with a large variety \nof situations \u2013 from child protection to mental health. His job is to make people and \nsituations safe until the specialist social workers come back on duty during the \nweekdays. So he may have to ensure children are in a place of safety if he judges \nthem to be at risk or arrange for people to go to hospital if they need to be there: \n\u201etidying things up as best you can until the next day\u201f. He described the work as very \nshort term and very stressful.  \n \nIn talking about his work, Jim said: \u201eI\u201fm trying to fight hard against being cynical\u201f; \u201eIt\u201fs \nnot worthwhile any more\u201f. This could be categorised as \u201eburn out\u201f due to the focus on \ncrisis in emergency social work. Indeed, Jim commented that quite often: \u201eI\u201fm just \nthere by myself and it\u201fs not very pleasant\u201f. But he also described his discomfort in \nbroader terms than simply \u201estress\u201f:  \n \nSo I'm beginning to think I really don't like it any more. Knocking on people's \ndoors and saying I need to talk to you because a report's been made that \nyou're not looking after your child. You know, it's not worthwhile any more. It's \nnot the right way to be doing it. There's other ways. And I'm just there by \nmyself and it's not very pleasant. So I'm beginning to think I'm doing it out of a \n 15 \nvery routine way. But I'm getting the sense back that it's not the right way and \nit\u201fs punishing people. And it's social work that's really cut down to the bone, \nabout as stark as it gets. I don\u201ft really like it any more. \n \nHe felt this way of doing things was \u201eunhealthy for the profession of social work\u201f, \nwhich should pay more attention to \u201ehow you regard people; how you treat people\u201f. \nHe indicated he was considering whether to stay in the job. In the meantime, he \ndoes what he can to mitigate the harmful effects of professional interventions on \npeople\u201fs lives - such as recommending good solicitors and using his discretion to \nrecommend extraordinary payments for people in crisis. \n______________________________________________________________ \n \nIn the account given above, Jim does not describe in detail what he thinks good \nsocial work is, but it is clear that he thinks it should involve treating people with \nrespect, and seeing them holistically in the context of their own lives and families. In \nthe process of giving the interview, Jim is reflecting on his role and making sense of \nit in relation to an ideal of what good social work should be. He is giving an image of \nhimself as someone who is \u201ebeginning to think\u201f and \u201egetting the sense back\u201f. He is \nbecoming aware that what he is engaged with is not \u201egood social work\u201f according to \nthe ideal standard that he holds. He presents himself as having a kind of generalised \ninternal dialogue. At the start of the quotation he says that he\u201fs \u201ebeginning to think I \nreally don\u201ft like it any more\u201f. At the end of the quotation he simply states: \u201eI don\u201ft like \nit any more\u201f. So his dislike has become more definite, although he still talks of \n\u201edislike\u201f rather than using a stronger term like not believing in what he\u201fs doing or \u201eI \ncan\u201ft be part of that any more\u201f.  Like the youth offending team manager quoted \nearlier, he is thinking of leaving his job because it does not live up to his ideal \u2013 \u201eit\u201fs \nnot the right way to be doing it\u201f. He can do small actions to try to operate according \nto his own standards of good practice, but this is not enough. \n \nThe limitations of each version of professional integrity \n \nI have outlined three versions of the concept of professional integrity, based around \nthe concepts of conduct, commitment and capacity. Each of these accounts taken on \nits own has some limitations.    \n 16 \n \n1. Conduct. This version of professional integrity has an emphasis on professional \nconduct in accordance with commonly accepted standards in the professional \ncommunity (generally as laid down by the professional body). The focus here is \non questions such as: \u201eWhat do you do?\u201f \u201eHow do you do it?\u201f If based on a \nprescriptive code of conduct or ethics, there is a danger that this approach can \nencourage unreflective rule-following and uncritical reliance on the professional \ncode. However, it is interesting to note that in the context of professional conduct \nhearings, despite the fact that the main emphasis is on conduct (what people \nhave done or failed to do), some account is taken of a person\u201fs character, \nespecially in the context of there being mitigating circumstances or testimony \nfrom witnesses as to a person\u201fs generally \u201egood character\u201f or their behaviour \nbeing \u201eout of character\u201f. For example, in a General Social Care Council conduct \ncase I observed on 9th September 2008, the GSCC legal advisor asked a witness \nhow long she had known the social worker against whom the complaint had been \nmade, and whether his action could have been out of character. \n \n2. Commitment. This version of professional integrity has an emphasis on the \npersonal commitment to a set of professional values based on an ideal of what \nthe profession might be at its best (beyond extant standards). The main \nquestions here are: \u201eWhat do you believe in?\u201f \u201eWhat are your values, motivations \nand projects?\u201f \u201eWhy are you doing this job\/work?\u201f If someone takes on a job as \npart of a personal vocation or calling (to serve humanity, or to do God\u201fs work) or \npolitical project (to promote eco-socialism), there is a danger that their \ncommitments may be too personal, self-referential and internally consistent, but \nnot sufficiently grounded in professional values and goals. They might be \nuncompromising in their commitments, which might turn into a personal crusade. \nTo guard against this, it is important to retain the concept of a community of \nprofessional practitioners (and their commonly accepted standards of conduct) as \na reference point, so that the cause being pursued is not purely personal or \nindividual. \n \n3. Capacity. This version of professional integrity has an emphasis on performance \nof the practitioner as a person who is able to engage in a process of reflexive \n 17 \nsense-making in relation to their personal and professional goals and values and \nis disposed to be reliably accountable. This capacity involves professionals \nhaving flexibility and the ability to negotiate personal and professional \ncommitments, to review and revise their values and projects as appropriate and \nto give publicly intelligible accounts of themselves and their work. The main \nquestions here are: \u201eHow do you make sense of what you do in terms of your \nvalues and ideals?\u201f \u201eHow do you make sense of your values in terms of what you \ndo?\u201f  The danger in this version of professional integrity is that the emphasis on \nperformance and public credibility could result in superficiality, ungrounded \nprojects and changeability in relation to values and ideals. The idea of capacity \ncomprising character as well as competence may help guard against this, as \ncharacter refers to a more stable set of dispositions.  \n \nThe implications of the discussion so far are that no one of the three versions of \nprofessional integrity is sufficient on its own to capture the ways in which we use the \nterm and what we might want it to mean in professional life. They represent a \nnumber of different strands that are part of the concept of professional integrity, \nwhich may overlap and are not mutually exclusive.   \n \nImplications for practice, policy and future research \n \nThis article has offered preliminary exploration of aspects of the concept of \nprofessional integrity in social welfare work. It was not the aim to produce a definitive \naccount or definition of professional integrity, but rather to undertake a conceptual \nanalysis drawing on and illustrated with accounts from the literature and interviews \nwith professional practitioners. The discussion suggests that we need to maintain a \ncritical awareness of how the concept of professional integrity is being used \u2013 \nwhether in a weaker (thinner) sense of good conduct according to externally \nprovided principles\/rules, or in a stronger (thicker) sense that also incorporates the \ninternally motivated commitments or performative capacities of practitioners. This \nanalysis is a timely reminder of the complexities of the concept of professional \nintegrity and the challenge of maintaining integrity in professional life. In this sense, \nthe analysis presented here does have practical implications.  \n \n 18 \nThe arguments developed in this article imply that if we allow the first version of \nprofessional integrity, as conduct according to minimum standards of good practice, \nto become the norm, then this is a significant weakening of the concept. There is a \nneed to reinvigorate dialogues and debates about the ideals and core purposes of \nprofessional work in the social welfare field and beyond, which rely on the second \nversion of professional integrity as about commitment(s). We need to consider how \nthe commitments and motivations of practitioners like Jane and Jim, whose accounts \nof their work were discussed earlier in this article, can not only be accommodated, \nbut also valued and maintained within the current ways of organising and practising \nin social welfare work.   \n \nThe second version of professional integrity, therefore, is very important and would \nbenefit from further examination and development in a social welfare context.  This \nversion focuses on the moral motivations and commitments of professional \npractitioners and is based on the idea of professional integrity as a moral quality or \nvirtue. While there is a large range of moral philosophical literature on virtue theories \nof ethics that we can draw upon to help with conceptual analysis and theorising \n(Swanton, 2003; Adams, 2006; Van Hooft, 2006), there is a need for further work to \ndevelop detailed virtue based approaches relevant to social welfare policy and \npractice (Banks and Gallagher, 2008 is an attempt to begin some of this more \ndetailed work). This is especially necessary in a climate where the focus of concern \nin social welfare policy and to some extent in social work ethics tends to be on the \nconduct of professional practitioners and the outcomes of their actions, (Banks, \n2008; Banks, 2009) rather than on the character and commitments of the \nprofessionals themselves. It is particularly important to undertake education, training \nand empirical research with professional practitioners that focuses both on their \ncommitment and on their capacities to perform as people of integrity, as outlined in \nthe third version of professional integrity. \n \nAccording to the third version of integrity (as a capacity or moral competence) an \nimportant element of performing as a person of professional integrity entails a \nprocess of reflexive sense-making and the giving of coherent accounts. Practitioners \nneed, therefore, to develop the capacity to be reflexive and to talk of themselves and \ntheir work in ways that are plausible and credible to themselves, colleagues, \n 19 \nemployers, other professionals and the wider public.  Hence practising the giving of \naccounts and entering into debate and dialogue as students and professionals is an \nessential set of skills to learn and rehearse. Indeed, arguably the ability to give a \ncompetent performance as \u201egood professional\u201f is part of what \u201ebeing a good \nprofessional\u201f entails (Taylor and White, 2000; White and Stancombe, 2003). \n \nFocussing on the second and third versions of professional integrity, a number of \nimportant moral qualities, attitudes and abilities that need continual emphasis in \nprofessional education can be identified (drawing on Banks and Gallagher, 2008) \nthat might offer a useful framework for further research. These elements include:  \n \n A commitment to a set of values, the content of which relates to what it means to \nbe a \u201egood person in a professional role\u201f and\/or a \u201egood professional\u201f.  \n An awareness that the values are inter-related to each other and form a coherent \nwhole and that their inter-relationship is what constitutes the overarching goals or \npurpose of the profession.  \n A capacity to make sense of professional values and their relationship to the \npractitioner\u201fs own personally-held values.  \n The ability to give a coherent account of beliefs and actions.  \n Strength of purpose and ability to implement these values. \n \nThe final point, about strength of purpose, is a crucial element of professional \nintegrity in practice. I suggested at the beginning of the article that integrity is often \nassociated with situations where practitioners\u201f values are undermined or threatened. \nThis requires practitioners to have courage. However, it is not just in particular cases \nor situations of adversity or poor practice that courage and determination to maintain \nintegrity are needed. These qualities are also needed to defend or reclaim the values \nof the welfare professions as a whole \u2013 values that are about social justice, equality \nand the transformation of people, communities and societies. A personal \ncommitment to good practice needs to be located within a set of political \ncommitments (Ferguson, 2008) to resist neo-liberal policies and practices and \npromote the social justice processes and outcomes that should be at the heart of the \nsocial welfare professions.     \n 20 \n \n \nAcknowledgements  \n \nI am grateful to the interviewees referred to in this article for allowing me to use \nmaterial from their interviews and to an anonymous referee for helpful comments. \nSome of the research on professional integrity was undertaken during a fellowship at \nthe Centre for Research in Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities at the University of \nCambridge during Autumn 2005.
