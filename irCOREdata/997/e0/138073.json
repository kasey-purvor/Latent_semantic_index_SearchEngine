Introduction\nLow cost portable systems for detecting and locating methane gas have wide use amongst\nthe gas utility companies for routine inspection of leaks from pipelines and storage\nfacilities, and for leak-report response applications. Leak detection can reduce product\nloss, minimise safety concerns, and ensure compliance with environmental regulations.\nThe conventional approach to low-level (ppm) leak detection is based upon flame\nionisation detectors (FIDs) [1] but such technology measures concentration at only a\nsingle point. Such point measurements make locating the source of a leak a difficult\nand slow process. This becomes even more problematic if the leak is associated with\nabove ground pipe-work, which is difficult to access. When trying to locate the source\nof a leak, the spatial distribution of the gas cloud is more informative than the precise\nmeasurement of concentration at a single point.\nTwo main approaches exist for gas imaging: active imaging based on optical\nabsorption of laser light, and passive imaging using ambient background radiation. For\nexample, Differential Absorption LIDAR (DIAL) instruments, which actively monitor\ngas using pulsed laser light, have been reported [2]. Such systems can detect gas over\nthe line-of-sight of the light beam using the light backscattered from the gas to give\nconcentration (from the signal size) and range (from the delay time). However, the\ndepth resolution of such systems is not suited to the short (10-20m) distance scales\nfor local leak detection. Alternatively, we use the backscattered light arising from an\nobject or surface behind the inspection region. This gives a stronger signal but at the\nexpense of losing the range information. However, we have found that operators are\nable to deduce as much range information as they need, when images are provided.\nOther examples of active imaging include backscatter absorption [3][4], and differential\nbackscatter absorption [5]. These systems can detect gas distributions by illuminating a\nscene using IR laser radiation and imaging the dark region arising from the attenuation\nof the backscattered light. Passive systems for imaging gas leaks have been demonstrated\nusing IR cameras employing outdoor thermal background radiation [6]. However, the\nsensitivity of passive systems is particularly susceptible to variations in background\ntemperature, which at certain time during the daily cycle may reduce the sensitivity of\nthe instrument to zero.\nMethane gas has its strongest absorption in the 3\u00b5m spectral region. An imaging\nsystem based on an optical parametric oscillator, operating at 3.27\u00b5m, has been reported\nby Stothard et al [7]. Such systems have the sensitivity and image framing required for\nthe resolution of plume motion. However, most of the corresponding laser sources,\nsuch as cryogenically cooled laser diodes and optical parametric oscillators, exceed the\ncost budget for a routine inspection device. In addition, the 3\u00b5m waveband is strongly\nabsorbed by vegetation meaning that the back scattered light from such cannot be relied\nupon to give an adequate light level. Methane also has an absorption band at 1.6\u00b5m\nwhich, although over one order-of-magnitude weaker, does coincide with the single-\nfrequency emission wavelength of low-cost InGaAs distributed feedback laser diodes [8],\nImaging of methane gas using a scanning, open-path laser system 3\nof the type we use here.\nOpen path, hand-held, methane detection systems which use distributed feedback\nInGaAs laser diodes at 1.65\u00b5m have previously been reported by ourselves [9] and other\ngroups [10][11]. Our system can measure methane at a range of several meters with\nsensitivity close to that required for detecting the atmospheric background of 1.6ppm,\nwith a response time of 100ms. We have now adapted this approach by incorporating\nthe sensor into a gas imaging system that scans a laser beam, and sensor field of\nview, over a region of interest and measures gas concentration using the backscattered\nlight. By combining the gas measurements with a colour camera image, the size and\norientation of the plume are evident through comparison with background objects that\nappear in the image. We have found that gas sources can be successfully located even\nwhen the gas image is over an order of magnitude lower resolution than the camera\nimage. Re-sampling and smoothing the low-resolution gas image obtained from the\nscanning IR laser beam, before superimposing onto a camera image, provides the\noperator with a clear indication of leak position and concentration. It is important\nto appreciate that unlike a point sensor, which measures concentration, an open-path\noptical system measures the integrated concentration (ppm.metre) over the line of sight.\nWithin our work, we express this as the integrated thickness of pure gas equivalent. i.e\n1000ppm.metre = 1mm gas. We find that the target user groups readily understand\nthis choice of measurement unit. It has been shown previously that a measurement of\n1mm gas is sufficient to detect a leak of 1 litre\/minute in light to moderate winds [12].\n2. Experimental configuration\nThe open path gas detector is based upon the design of the hand-held system reported\npreviously in reference [9] and is configured as an optical head containing a InGaAs\nlaser diode, temperature controller, Fresnel collection lens 150mm in diameter and\nphotodiode. This is coupled to a control box containing the laser driver, lock-in\namplifiers and data acquisition electronics. The laser diode package includes the\nthermoelectric temperature stage, a methane-filled reference photodiode, and output\nbeam collimation. The backscattered light is collected by the low-cost acrylic Fresnel\nlens and focused onto an InGaAs detector with integral amplifier. The wavelength of\nthe laser is current modulated over the methane transition enabling normal wavelength\nmodulation spectroscopy techniques. The signal from the methane-filled reference\nphotodiode is demodulated at 3f and used to give an error signal within a closed loop\ncontrol, maintaining the diode wavelength at the methane transition. The backscattered\nlight is demodulated both at 1f to give a measure of the backscattered intensity and at 2f\nto give a signal corresponding to the gas falling within the optical path. Dividing the 2f\nsignal by the 1f signal gives the gas concentration normalised with respect to reflectivity\nand range of the backscatter surface. Under favourable backscatter conditions (i.e. a\nnear normal clean surface) we obtain an instrument sensitivity of 10ppm.metre and\n10Hz bandwidth.\nImaging of methane gas using a scanning, open-path laser system 4\nFigure 1. Photograph of the system showing the optical head, scanning mirror, and\nCCD camera.\nThe whole system is mounted on a tripod. The optical head is fixed with respect\nto the tripod, the scanning is accomplished using a large scanning mirror, driven by\na pair of servomotors under the control of a ruggedised laptop computer. The gas\nconcentration is relayed as an analogue voltage to the laptop, which correlates it to\nthe scanner position. In addition, a colour image is recorded using a CCD camera and\nrelayed to the laptop which combines it with the gas image, allowing the operator to\nlocate the source of the gas leak. Figure 1 shows a photograph of the scanning system.\nClearly there is a relationship between the sensitivity of the gas detection and\nbandwidth of the measurements, having implications for the frame rate of the imaging\nsystem. If we attempted to image the gas cloud at > 0.25 million pixels, the frame rate\nof the system would be unacceptably slow. However, since gas clouds are ill defined,\nimaging at such high resolutions is unnecessary in leak detection applications. Our gas\nimages are created by performing 10 vertical line scans over the field of view, each taking\n1 second with a detection bandwidth of 10Hz. The resulting gas image, with a resolution\nequivalent to 10 \u00d7 10 pixels, is re-sampled and smoothed before being combined with\nthe red plane of the colour camera image. This results in a smooth image of the gas\nleak, shown in red, superimposed with the background image. Figure 2 shows the\nconfiguration of the scanning, open-path, laser system.\n3. Laboratory characterisation\nOur initial demonstration was to image an array of Tedlar sample bags (which are\ntransmitting at 1650nm) containing various gas mixtures, mounted to the door of the\nlaboratory and covering field of view of the detection system. Figure 3 shows an image\nImaging of methane gas using a scanning, open-path laser system 5\n10\n.0\n0\nCCD\nMirror\nOptical Head\nGas\nLeak\nIR Laser\nBackscattered\nLight\nField of view of CCD\nScan Direction\nFigure 2. Using a scanning, open-path, laser system to image natural gas leaks.\nof 5 bags, 3 containing pure methane with a depth of \u223c 5mm, 1 containing \u223c 100mm\nof 1% methane (equivalent to 1mm pure gas), and 1 containing nitrogen. It can be seen\nthat a 1mm thick cloud of methane is easily identified and represents the acceptable\nlower requirement of the leak detector. By examining areas of the gas image where\nno sample bag is present we find that the noise equivalent concentration is 0.03mm =\n30ppm.metre. It is important to note that the noise equivalent concentration increases\nwhen the light is backscattered from a surface which is not normal to the sensor, or has\npoorer reflectivity.\nSubsequently to imaging of the sealed bags a real methane gas source was introduced\nto the ventilated laboratory. This source was set with a flow rate of 1 litre\/minute and\ncoupled to the field of view of the imaging system using a 6mm pipe.\nWe created two movies from the images recorded using our system in the laboratory.\nFigure 4 shows images taken from each of the movies. The first image is of two Tedlar\nbags, one 5 litre and one 1 litre, each filled to \u223c 5mm thickness. The second image is of\na 1 litre\/minute simulated gas leak. The original images are updated every 10 seconds\nbut for ease of viewing the movies are replayed at an increased (\u00d710) frame rate.\n4. Field-testing\nMost applications for a gas imaging system are out of doors, where the local wind field\nacts to disperse the gas. As a demonstration we tested our system outside by imaging\nmethane against a background containing foliage. As before, we created movies using the\nrecorded images. Figure 5 shows images taken from each of the movies. The first image is\nof a Tedlar bag filled to 5-10mm gas. The second image is of a 1 litre\/minute simulated\ngas leak, delivered via a tube located under the foliage. We recorded a sequence of\nImaging of methane gas using a scanning, open-path laser system 6\nFigure 3. Image of sample bags containing various gas mixtures (top left).

Discussion\nFor applications requiring higher frame rates, the system could be modified to use\ngalvanometers, rather than stepper motors like the ones used in our system, to scan\nthe laser and collection optics. As discussed above, there is a relationship between the\nsensitivity of the gas concentration measurements and the measurement bandwidth.\nHigher frame rates can therefore be achieved but this is at the expense of poorer signal\nto noise.\n6. Conclusions\nWe have demonstrated that a scanning, open-path, optical system based on a distributed\nfeedback InGaAs laser diode at 1.65\u00b5m is effective for visualising methane gas leaks.\nIn order to locate a gas leak, we have found it unnecessary to image the gas at video\nresolution or frame rate. Our images have an effective resolution of 10 \u00d7 10 pixels,\nwhich are then processed and combined with a full resolution camera image. We have\ndemonstrated performance of the system by imaging a gas leak of \u223c 1 litre\/minute\noutside the laboratory and have shown that there is sufficient 1.6\u00b5m backscattered light\nto image the leak against a variety of backgrounds including foliage.\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful for funding from the European Commission under contract NNE5-1999-\n20031.\nImaging of methane gas using a scanning, open-path laser system 8\nReferences\n[1] Simpson C F and Gough T A 1981 Direct quantitative-analysis using flame ionization detection -\nthe construction and performance of the fidoh detector J.
