Because bedload transport laws are \nnonlinear, width-averaged calculations will underestimate the true bedload flux if there is any \nlocal spatial variation in either the bed or the flow. This paper analyses the effects on bedload \ntransport capacity of spatial variation in applied (\u03c4) and critical (\u03c4c) shear stress, separately \nand in combination. A simple but versatile statistical model is used to represent variability in \n\u03c4, with allowance for differences between sand- and gravel-bed rivers and for below-bankfull \nflow. Bedload flux is shown to increase greatly with the variance of \u03c4, especially in gravel-\nbed rivers. Variability in \u03c4c through bed patchiness may increase, reduce, or make little \ndifference to bedload flux depending on the correlation between \u03c4 and \u03c4c. Simple width \naveraging leads to severe underestimation of bedload transport in most conditions; some \nalternatives are considered.

Sediment imbalances are sometimes the result of \nhuman activity affecting either capacity (e.g. flow regulation or meander rectification) or \nsupply (e.g. deforestation or mine waste disposal), but can also arise naturally for such \nreasons as climate change, sea-level change, overloading from hillsides during extreme \nstorms, and reduced capacity as slope declines towards base level.   \nOne of the ways to understand the behaviour of rivers in disequilibrium, and to predict the \ncourse of transient adjustment in specific circumstances, is to use a numerical sediment \nrouting model (SRM hereafter). Such models compute at each of many time steps first the \nflow properties, then the transport capacity, at a series of nodes along the river. The channel \nlong profile is then updated using the overall sediment continuity equation. Early SRMs \n(reviewed by Dawdy and Vanoni, 1986) represented the bed by a single grain size. This may \nbe adequate for sand-bed rivers but is a severe simplification for gravel-bed rivers. In a newer \ngeneration of what may be called \u2018fractional\u2019 SRMs, designed for gravel-bed rivers, transport \ncapacity is calculated separately for each size fraction of bed material. This allows \nFerguson2003Geomorphology.doc  page 1 \nsimultaneous updating of both bed elevation and bed grain size distribution at each node, the \nlatter using a fractional continuity equation. Much of the impetus for developing fractional \nSRMs came from geomorphology and sedimentology, especially through attempts to \nunderstand the evolution of downstream-fining aggradational sequences in gravel-bed rivers \n(Parker, 1991; Hoey and Ferguson, 1994) and the rock record (Robinson and Slingerland, \n1998), but these models are now being applied to practical engineering and management \nproblems of river response to disturbance (e.g. Talbot and Lapointe, 2002). Limitations in the \naccuracy of simple and fractional SRMs are therefore of potential significance to \ngeomorphologists, sedimentologists, and engineers. \nAlmost all SRMs are one-dimensional in the sense that they treat flow and sediment transport \non a width-averaged basis. This simplifies the calculations, allows better temporal and spatial \nresolution with available computing power, and minimises input-data requirements. But it \nmay be a weakness if lateral variability in hydraulic conditions and bedload transport rates is \nimportant in the real rivers to which 1-D models are applied. Flow strength may vary across a \nriver because parts of the channel are deeper than others, through the retarding effect of bank \nfriction, or because of flow structures inherited from upstream. Bedload transport rates will \nvary accordingly, and will also be affected by any local sorting of the bed into coarser or finer \npatches. In applications to straight, narrow canals or flumes (e.g. Cui et al., 1996) it may be \nreasonable to approximate the channel as rectangular and assume that lateral variation in \nprocesses is negligibly small, but this may less realistic when modelling natural river channels \nwith bar-pool-riffle morphology (e.g. Hoey and Ferguson, 1994). For example, Wathen et al. \n(1995) and Powell et al. (1999) measured substantial lateral variation in bedload flux even in \nstraight reaches of such channels. Failure to allow for bed patchiness or local spatial \nvariability in flow strength may lead to underestimation of bedload fluxes (Paola and Seal, \n1995; Paola, 1996; Nicholas, 2000) and this could affect the results obtained by applying \nsimple or fractional SRMs. The influence of lateral variability on a river's transport capacity is \nalso an important consideration in the design of channelization and river-training projects. \nThis paper investigates how well a 1-D treatment represents bedload transport in non-uniform \nchannels. An idealised mathematical model is developed. Results obtained from it suggest \nthat the total bedload flux with given mean flow and bed conditions is highly dependent on \nthe degree of lateral variation around the mean conditions, and that 1-D computations can \ngive extremely biased estimates of flux. Preliminary consideration is also given to possible \nways to reduce this bias without moving completely away from a 1-D approach. \nProblem statement \nThe root of the lateral-variation issue is the averaging of a nonlinear process: bedload \ntransport. There are many different predictive formulae for the transport capacity q [L3L-1T-1] \nof bed material of a given diameter D under a specified fluid flow. The flow is usually \nquantified by the bed shear stress, \u03c4. Some formulae use other flow properties, for example \nshear velocity or specific stream power, but the argument is essentially the same whichever is \npreferred and for definiteness I use shear stress below. There are many different \u03c4-based \nbedload formulae, but they all predict that transport rate increases faster than linearly with \u03c4, \nand is negligibly small when \u03c4 is less than some critical, quasi-threshold value \u03c4c which \ndepends on D.  \nEven if D, and hence \u03c4c, is the same everywhere within a channel reach, if \u03c4 varies across the \nchannel the true total flux Q [L3T-1] conveyed by the river has to be obtained by integrating \nacross the width w of the channel: \nFerguson2003Geomorphology.doc  page 2 \n( )\u222b= w dxqQ\n0\n)1(\u03c4  \nwhere x is lateral distance. The mean transport rate per unit width is then qav = Q\/w. In \nconstrast, a 1-D (width-averaged) estimate of the flux makes the assumption that qav = q(\u03c4av) \nwhere \u03c4av is the mean shear stress averaged across the channel. This mean stress is generally \ncomputed as \u03c4av = \u03c1gRS where \u03c1 is water density, g the acceleration of gravity, R the \nhydraulic radius (effectively the same as the mean depth in most rivers), and S the water-\nsurface slope. The width-averaged estimate of the total flux is \nQa = w q(\u03c4av)  (2) \nIt differs from the true flux Q given by eq.1 unless either the transport function q(\u03c4) is linear, \ncontrary to a huge mass of data, or the channel has laterally constant shear stress. With a \nnonlinear law, if \u03c4 varies across the channel the additional flux in high-\u03c4 parts of the channel \noutweighs the lower flux in low-\u03c4 parts, and the total flux Q is higher than Qa.  \nBrownlie (1981) is reported as having recognised this as the likely reason why transport \nequations calibrated to flume data (laterally uniform conditions) under-predicted field \nmeasurements (laterally variable conditions). Paola (1996) analysed the problem in the \ncontext of braided rivers. By making assumptions about the spatial probability distribution of \ndepth (used as a surrogate for \u03c4) he showed the importance of confluence scour pools as \nconduits for bedload transport, and estimated that Q exceeded Qa by a factor of ~3. Nicholas \n(2000) modified Paola\u2019s theory to allow for variable water discharge and applied it to a \nbraided river in New Zealand. He showed that Qa underestimated Q by a factor of 2 to 3 at \nlow flows, but much less so in large floods. \nEssentially the same argument applies to spatial variability in \u03c4c. With \u03c4 spatially uniform, but \ncoarse and fine patches of bed material such that \u03c4c varies spatially, the nonlinearity of the \ntransport law again means that the width-integrated bedload flux will exceed what would be \ncalculated on a width-averaged basis using the mean value of \u03c4c. This was recognised by \nPaola and Seal (1995) as part of a wider discussion of the effects of bed patchiness on size \nselectivity in bedload transport. Their calculations suggested that the total flux can be several \ntimes greater than would be estimated using the grand-average grain size distribution. \nIf both \u03c4 and \u03c4c vary spatially the situation becomes more complicated, and it is clear that \ndifferent outcomes are possible depending on the sign and magnitude of the correlation \nbetween \u03c4c and \u03c4. Random patchiness in a channel with variable \u03c4 ought to give even higher \nbedload flux than variance in just \u03c4 or just \u03c4c, but how much higher is not obvious. In the \nunlikely event of a negative correlation between \u03c4 and \u03c4c the capacity would be further \nincreased. Conversely a positive correlation (which seems the likeliest scenario, since \npatchiness is usually caused by flow nonuniformity) must reduce spatial differences in \ntransport rate because high-\u03c4 parts of the channel have relatively armoured beds, and low-\u03c4 \nareas have more mobile fine sediment. But it is not clear whether the effect on total bedload \nflux of lateral variation in \u03c4c will completely cancel out that of variation in \u03c4. \nAnalytical model \nThese issues are investigated below using a mathematical model which has been designed to \nrepresent a wide range of generic circumstances, whilst being sufficiently simple that general \nanalytical solutions can be derived rather than relying on numerical calculations for just a few \nscenarios. The four components of the model are a bedload transport law; a statistical model \nFerguson2003Geomorphology.doc  page 3 \nfor lateral variability in \u03c4 which allows different means and variances; a way of allowing for \nflow stage variation; and alternative representations of bed patchiness and thus variance in \u03c4c. \nBedload transport function \nFor definiteness in what follows a particular transport function is adopted. As in Paola (1996) \nand Nicholas (2000) the choice is the Meyer-Peter and M\u00fcller (MPM) equation, which is \nwidely used as well as simple and mathematically tractable. Its performance in comparisons \nwith field measurements has been uneven (Gomez and Church, 1989; Reid et al., 1996), \nperhaps according to degree of armouring, but it is no worse than some much more \ncomplicated functions. A different transport law would be expected to give qualitatively \nsimilar results.The MPM equation can be written in the form \nq = k (\u03c4 - \u03c4c)1.5  (3) \nfor \u03c4 >\u03c4c, or q = 0 for lower stresses. The constant k depends on sediment density but not on \ngrain size, which affects transport rate only through \u03c4c.  \nIn fractional SRMs different size fractions of bed material are treated separately. To achieve \nthis a transport function like (3) is modified in two ways: the transport rate for each size \nfraction is assumed proportional to its availability in the bed, and the value of \u03c4c is varied \nbetween sizes to allow for selective transport. For simplicity the first part of the analysis \nbelow ignores the existence of a spread of sizes at each point in the river bed, but later on I \nintroduce a distribution of \u03c4c values which can represent either intra- or inter-patch variation. \nStatistical model for spatial variation in shear stress \nAlthough the spatially-averaged mean shear stress \u03c4av on the bed of a river can be calculated \nfrom the mean depth, the local shear stress \u03c4 does not depend directly on local depth d but on \nthe vertical velocity gradient near the bed. Even in straight flat-bottomed laboratory channels \nand canals there is a reduction in \u03c4 from the centreline towards the edges where velocity is \nreduced by bank friction (e.g. Knight et al., 1994). In natural channels the spatial variability \nof \u03c4 is increased by three further factors: variation in d both laterally across bars and talwegs \nand longitudinally over pools and riffles; planimetric convergence and divergence of flow, \nwith consequent acceleration and deceleration, for example in braid confluences and \ndiffluences; and secondary circulation, with \u03c4 higher where there is downwelling of relatively \nfast surface water than where there is upwelling of slow near-bed fluid. \nJust as \u03c4av depends on dav, so it seems likely that the variance of \u03c4 increases with that of d. \nPrevious investigators (Paola, 1996; Nicholas, 2000) have therefore used depth data, which \nare readily obtainable, as a surrogate for information on spatial patterns of \u03c4 which are \nextremely hard to measure. It is recognised that some areas (e.g. riffles and bar heads) may \nhave low d but high \u03c4, and other areas the reverse (e.g. in the lee of bars), partly because of \nlocal differences in water-surface slope. This was well demonstrated by Lisle et al. (2000) \nusing a quasi-3-D flow model to estimate the spatial pattern of \u03c4 in several gravel-bed reaches \nwith alternate bars. Field measurements by Bathurst et al. (1979) in gravel-bed meander \nbends also show that maximum \u03c4 need not coincide spatially with maximum d. But both \nstudies showed a positive correlation between d and \u03c4, and as Nicholas (2000) pointed out, \nlocal deviations from \u03c4 \u221d d tend to cancel out so that the frequency distributions of \u03c4 and d are \nsimilar. \nPaola (1996) and Nicholas (2000) represented the spatial variability of d by the two-parameter \ngamma distribution, which is versatile and gave good fits to the braided-river data they were \nconsidering. They found, however, that the shape parameter of the distribution varied \nFerguson2003Geomorphology.doc  page 4 \nsystematically with flow level so that the distribution ought to be re-fitted for every flow level \nof interest. I have preferred to think in terms of a probability distribution of \u03c4 itself, and have \ndeveloped a new model which makes it easier to consider the effects of change in flow level \nand is more amenable to an analytical treatment. \nThe starting point is a probability distribution for the spatial distribution of shear stress during \nbankfull flow, denoted hereafter by \u03c4b. An assumption about how the distribution alters as \nstage falls is added later. The bankfull distribution is represented by a compound rectangular \ndistribution with two parameters, one fixing the mean and the other the variance of \u03c4b. Shear \nstress is assumed to be below its mean value a in a proportion b of the total channel width \n(0 < b < 1), and to vary randomly (i.e. follow a uniform or rectangular distribution) between 0 \nand a within that part of the channel. Shear stress is above average in the remaining \nproportion 1-b of the width, and is assumed to vary randomly between a and a maximum \nwhich has to be a\/(1-b) in order that the overall mean stress is a. Thus the probability density \nfunction of \u03c4b is \n( ) ( ) )4(0 aa\na\nbp bb \u2264\u2264= \u03c4\u03c4  \n( ) )4(\n1\n1 2 b\nb\naa\nab\nb\nb \u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n\u2212\u2264\u2264\n\u2212= \u03c4  \nThe variance of \u03c4b in this model can be found to be a2b\/3(1-b), so the coefficient of variation \n(standard deviation divided by mean) in percentage form is \n)5(\n)1(3\n100\nb\nbcv \u2212=\u03c4\n \nThis increases monotonically with b, which is therefore an index of spatial variability in \nbankfull shear stress. For example, the cv is 0, 29%, 58%, or 115% for b = 0, 0.2, 0.5, or 0.8. \nFigure 1 illustrates this distribution model in two different ways. Figure 1a shows cumulative \ndistributions of \u03c4b for selected values of b. The distributions have a dog-leg shape with two \nlinear segments, except for b = 0.5 when they have the same slope and there is a single \nuniform distribution of \u03c4b between 0 and 2a. As b increases so does the maximum shear \nstress, from 25% above the mean for b = 0.2 to twice the mean for b = 0.5 and five times for b \n= 0.8. Figure 1b represents these distributions as asymmetric channel cross sections which \nwould give the same distributions if \u03c4b varied exactly as local depth. When the model is \nvisualised in this way the parameter b is an index of channel shape: progressively closer to \nrectangular as b\u21920, but progressively non-rectangular as b\u21921 and the contrast grows \nbetween extensive shallow, low-\u03c4 areas and a narrow, deep, high-\u03c4 talweg. Low values of b \ncorrespond to flume- or canal-like conditions, with a wide area in which \u03c4b slightly exceeds \nthe mean and a small area with much lower stress (e.g. near the banks). Higher values of b \nrepresent the much less uniform conditions associated with unconstrained natural planforms, \nwith extensive areas of below-average \u03c4 (e.g. bar tops and margins, backwaters) and local \nareas of much higher \u03c4 (e.g. meander pools, braid confluences, and other talwegs). \nThere appear to be no published data with which to check how representative this model is of \nnatural rivers. However, two lines of evidence suggest it is not unrealistic. First, many of the \ndepth distributions shown by Mosley (1982, 1983) and Nicholas (2000) have the dogleg \ncharacter shown in Figure 1a. Also, in ongoing research I and colleagues are analysing \nacoustic doppler profiles of velocity at near-bankfull discharge in Fraser River, Canada. \nDistributions of shear stress estimated by fitting the law of the wall to the depth-averaged \nFerguson2003Geomorphology.doc  page 5 \nmean velocity, and also distributions of water depth, are fitted at least as well on average by \nthe b-model as by a two-parameter gamma distribution. Values of b, estimated by matching \nmoments, range from ~0.4 to ~0.7.  \nAllowance for sub-bankfull flow \nThe compound-rectangular statistical model just described is for the spatial distribution of \nshear stress at bankfull discharge. As discharge falls below bankfull, \u03c4 is expected to become \nlower everywhere in the channel, and to vanish in areas which become dry. The mean shear \nstress declines in direct proportion to the mean depth, and it seems reasonable in a generic \nmodel to suppose that the entire distribution of \u03c4 can be shifted. Thus it is assumed that the \nstress distribution continues to follow (4), but with \u03c4b replaced by \n\u03c4 = \u03c4b \u2013 fa   (6) \nwhere f is the fractional reduction in mean \u03c4 (and also mean depth) below its bankfull value. \nNote that this does not represent an assumption that the distribution retains the same shape at \nlower stages. Rather, for values f <1 a fraction fb of the width is now dry so that the \ndistribution is progressively truncated from one end, becoming a single rectangular \ndistribution for f >1. This treatment would be exactly correct if local shear stress was \nproportional to local depth.  \nThe relationship between f and water discharge can be established using Manning\u2019s equation \nwith constant values of n and slope. Eq. 6 then implies that the ratio R of water discharge at \nstage f to water discharge at bankfull is \nR = (1 - fb)(1 - f + f 2b\/2)5\/3   (7) \nThis depends far more on f than on b, in a slightly nonlinear manner. Values of f = 0.4 and 0.8 \nare used for illustrative purposes below; they correspond to discharges ~60% and ~90% \nbelow bankfull respectively. \nRepresentation of threshold for transport \nThe simplest assumption about the critical shear stress \u03c4c is that it is the same everywhere in \nthe channel. This case is considered first, but is relaxed later on. To keep the model \nnondimensional the constant value is specified as a fraction c of the mean bankfull shear \nstress; that is,  \n\u03c4c = ca     (8) \nIn alternative scenarios which allow for bed patchiness the mean value of \u03c4c continues to \nfollow (8). Values of c are assumed to lie between 0 and 1 in the subsequent analysis, so that \nin bankfull conditions all areas with above-average shear stress experience some bedload \ntransport as do some areas of lower \u03c4 to the extent that c <1.  \nThe ratio 1\/c = \u03c4av\/\u03c4c is a dimensionless transport stage in bankfull conditions. In gravel-bed \nrivers it has a typical value of 1.2-1.4 (e.g. Parker, 1978; Andrews, 1984; Paola, 1996), \nimplying c \u2248 0.7-0.8. A value of 0.8 is used below as typical of gravel-bed rivers in the \nbankfull or near-bankfull conditions at which most bedload is conveyed. With increasing \namounts of sand in the bed the value of c falls, tending to zero in large sand-bed rivers.  \nAnalysing the effect of lateral variation in \u03c4c requires making assumptions about the nature of \nspatial variability in grain size, and in particular to what extent it is correlated with shear \nstress. Field evidence on this is virtually nonexistent. Limited data do exist on the correlation \nof grain size and depth (e.g. Mosley, 1982, 1983; Seal and Paola, 1995), but no clear \ngeneralisations have emerged. Two limiting scenarios are therefore considered below: purely \nFerguson2003Geomorphology.doc  page 6 \nrandom patchiness, and perfect fining upwards as in classical models of meander point bars. \nThese cases correspond to correlations of 0 and 1 between \u03c4c and \u03c4b.  \nResults \nI describe the implications of my model in stages, starting with the effect of lateral variation \nin shear stress on total bedload flux in channels with uniform beds and then moving on to the \neffect of bed patchiness.  \nThe effects are quantified using a general analytical solution for the width-integrated bedload \nflux in a channel with spatially variable \u03c4 and\/or \u03c4c. This involves integrating the MPM \nequation (eq.3) across the channel. The distribution of \u03c4-\u03c4c is given by eq. 4 with \u03c4b replaced \nby \u03c4b \u2013 (c+f)a (from eqs. 6 and 8). Then Q = w qav with the mean transport rate obtained as  \n\u222b= max0 5.1 )(yav dyypykq  \nwhere y denotes \u03c4-\u03c4c and ymax = a\/(1-b) \u2013 (c+f)a. For the case c + f <1 this integration yields \n( ) ( )( )[ ]( )\n( ) ( ) )9(11\n1\n1114.0\n5.22\n5.0\n5.2\n5.25.1\n\u23ad\u23ac\n\u23ab\n\u23a9\u23a8\n\u23a7 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\n+\u2212\u2212+\u2212\u2212=\nb\nfcb\nbb\nfcbfcbkwaQ  \nThe first term inside the curly brackets quantifies the flux in parts of the channel which have \nbelow-average \u03c4 in bankfull conditions; the other two terms relate to areas of higher \u03c4. If c+f \n>1, as can happen in gravel-bed rivers at sub-bankfull discharge, the first and third terms \ndisappear. As b \u21920 eq. 9 converges on the width-averaged estimate of bedload flux, which is \ngiven as in eq. 2 by \nQa = kw(\u03c4av - \u03c4c)1.5  =  kwa1.5(1 - c - f)1.5    (10) \nif c + f <1, or zero for higher values of c + f. \nAccording to the model, then, the total bedload flux in a river depends on the channel width w \nand mean bankfull shear stress a; the transport-rate coefficient k in the MPM equation; and \nthe dimensionless parameters which characterise stress variance or channel shape (b), critical \nshear stress (c), and flow reduction below bankfull (f). The dimensional variables w, a and \nconstant k determine the absolute levels of bedload flux, irrespective of channel character, and \ncan be fixed when investigating the effects of b, c, f. For illustrative purposes below I set \nkwa1.5 = 1, so that all results are normalised relative to the bedload conveyance of bankfull \nflow in a sand-bed canal (eq.10 with c = f = 0). \nEffect of shear stress variance on bedload flux \nThe width-integrated flux Q in a channel with no patchiness is plotted in Figure 2 as a \nfunction of the stress-variance index b. Although Q depends on both c and f as well as b, these \nparameters do not have unique effects since they occur only in the combination c+f. The full \nrange of conditions is therefore covered by plotting curves of Q for different values of c+f, \neach of which could be made up of different combinations of c and f. \nFigure 2 shows that, whatever the value of c+f, Q increases considerably with b. The bedload \nconveyance is greater under non-uniform flow because the increase in specific flux q in parts \nof the channel with above-average shear stress is bigger than the decrease in q in parts with \nbelow-average stress. For bankfull sand-bed conditions (c+f = 0) the total flux Q increases by \nonly about 40% from b = 0 to 0.8, but for bankfull gravel-bed conditions (c+f = 0.8) it \nincreases by a factor of 8. The mid-range value b = 0.5 of the channel-shape or stress-variance \nindex gives about a threefold increase in bedload conveyance compared to a uniform channel, \nwhich is about the same as Paola (1996) and Nicholas (2000) calculated for specific gravel-\nFerguson2003Geomorphology.doc  page 7 \nbed situations. The curve for c+f = 0.8 also describes a sand-bed river at low flow. When c+f  \n>1, which corresponds to a gravel-bed river at below-bankfull flow, there is no bedload \ntransport in near-uniform channels (b close to 0) because \u03c4 < \u03c4c everywhere, but in channels \nwith higher b there is transport in the parts of the channel with highest \u03c4 so that the flux \nincreases rapidly with b. The value of c+f makes rather less difference in high-b channels than \nin those which are more rectangular.  \nLateral variability in shear stress therefore makes a big difference to bedload transport \ncapacity, but one which varies according to the precise conditions. The finding that the \ndifference between Q and Qa depends on both flow stage and cross-section geometry is \nconsistent with the calculations of Nicholas (2000) for specific field sites in New Zealand. It \nis noteworthy that the flux in a highly non-uniform gravel-bed channel can attain ~80% of \nthat in a uniform sand-bed channel of the same width and mean \u03c4, despite the much greater \nvalue of \u03c4c for gravel than sand.  \nEq.9 may also be used to assess the flow level at which significant bedload transport \ncommences in channels with different degrees of lateral variation in \u03c4. Figure 2 indicates that \nQ increases with increasing b for given c+f, and with decreasing c+f for given b. This implies \nthat, for a given value of c (i.e. of  \u03c4av\/\u03c4c), as the channel becomes less uniform (higher b) a \ngiven flux can be conveyed by a lower flow (higher f). To illustrate this, let \u2018significant\u2019 \ntransport be defined as 10% of the flux conveyed at bankfull discharge in a channel with the \nsame values of \u03c4av and \u03c4c but no variability in \u03c4. For a sand-bed river (c = 0) significant \ntransport begins at f \u2248 0.7 (~15% of bankfull discharge) for b = 0, but at progressively lower \nlevels (f \u2248 0.9, 1.3, and >3) as b increases from 0.2 through 0.5 to 0.8. In a gravel-bed river (c \n= 0.8) significant transport requires near-bankfull flow (f \u2248 0.1) for b = 0, but again occurs at \nprogressively lower levels (f \u2248 0.4, 0.5, >3) for b = 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8. The same total flux Q is \nconveyed in less and less width through an increase in the intensity of transport. This accords \nwith the observation that in irregular natural channels, bedload continues to move at \ndischarges well below bankfull.     \nEffects of bed sorting and patchiness on bedload flux \nThe results in Figure 2 are for channels with constant \u03c4c, implying spatially uniform grain \nsize. For sand-bed rivers this may be a reasonable assumption if bedforms are fairly uniform, \nbut the more diverse bed material in gravel-bed rivers is often sorted spatially into coarser or \nfiner patches. There is also a size distribution at each point, with lower \u03c4c for the fine fractions \nthan the coarse ones. \nThe effects of intra-patch variation in \u03c4c, and of inter-patch variation that is spatially random, \ncan be represented in my analysis by averaging solutions to eq.9 across a distribution of \nvalues of c. For illustrative purposes I have used an approximately normal distribution of \nvalues: c-2e, c-e, c, c+e, c+2e with weights 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1 respectively. With e = 0 this \nreduces to eq.9; higher values of e, up to the limit e = c\/2, represent more poorly-sorted \nsediment at a point and\/or a greater degree of random patchiness across the channel. \nFigure 3 shows the results of this calculation for bankfull or near-bankfull flow in gravel-bed \nrivers (c = 0.8). Two curves are shown, one for e = 0.2 which implies that \u03c4c varies by +50% \naround its mean value and the other for e = 0.4 which implies the maximum possible variation \nof +100% in \u03c4c. In both cases the bedload conveyance of the channel is increased over that for \nuniform \u03c4c and the same variance in \u03c4 as indexed by b. The reduction in flux over coarser \npatches (or in the coarse tail of the size distribution at a point) is less than the increase in flux \nover finer patches (or in the fine tail of the distribution). The increase is greater for higher e, \nas expected, and is substantial in fairly uniform flow conditions (low values of b). In the \nFerguson2003Geomorphology.doc  page 8 \nlimiting case b = 0 the bedload conveyance is higher by a factor of ~1.5 for e = 0.2 and ~2.5 \nfor e = 0.4. But as b increases, the effect of bed variability becomes less and less important \ncompared to the effect of flow variability, so that by b = 0.8 the increase in conveyance is \nonly a few percent even for e = 0.4. It should be noted that 'increase' is used here relative to  \nthe true flux for the given degree of hydraulic variability (Q in Figure 3), not the width-\naveraged estimate of the flux calculated using a single grain size (Qa). Figure 3 shows that Qa \nis always considerably lower than the true flux in a channel with random patches and\/or \ngrain-size distribution. \nRandom patchiness is one end-member in the likely range of scenarios with different degrees \nof positive correlation between \u03c4 and \u03c4c. The other extreme, with a correlation of +1 instead of \n0, is perfect fining upwards of the kind predicted in the classical meander point-bar model in \nwhich both shear stress and grain size decrease systematically from the outer-bank pool to the \ntop of the inner-bank point bar. This scenario can be represented in the present model by \nassuming that \u03c4c = c\u03c4 at all points, thus increasing from 0 to a maximum of ac\/(1-b) while \nretaining the same mean value ca as in other scenarios. It follows that \u03c4 - \u03c4c = \u03c4b(1-c)\u2013fa. The \nbedload conveyance of a channel with perfect fining upwards can therefore be calculated \nusing eq.9 with the parameters a, c, f replaced by a' =a(1-c), c' =0, and f' =f\/(1-c). \nFigure 3 shows that this scenario gives a very different result from random patchiness. The \nconveyance of the channel is drastically reduced, and varies much less with stress variance \nthan in the no-patch or random-patch cases. It is therefore much closer to the width-averaged \nestimate Qa than in other scenarios. The physical explanation for this is that high-stress parts \nof the channel are armoured by coarse bed material. The reduction in flux in these areas far \noutweighs the gain in flux in low-stress areas with a fine bed. Put another way, the variance of \nthe excess stress \u03c4-\u03c4c is greatly reduced and so therefore is the bias in the width-averaged \nestimate of total conveyance.  \nThe range of possibilities between these two end-member scenarios is evidently very wide. A \nsimple or weighted average of the random and fining-upwards cases would give a higher \nbedload flux than with no patches in near-uniform flow conditions (low b in Figure 3), but \nlower than with no patches in more variable flow conditions (high b). Calculations for \nscenarios with less-than-perfect fining upwards, or with a quasi-random range of below-\naverage values of \u03c4c where \u03c4 is below average and a range of above-average values of \u03c4c \nwhere \u03c4 is above average, yield a wide variety of curves depending on the precise \nassumptions. It seems safe to say that bedload conveyance in situations where both \u03c4 and \u03c4c \nvary spatially in a partly-correlated way will be higher than a width-averaged calculation \nwould suggest; but by how much, and whether by as much as in the no-patch model, will \ndepend on the circumstances.  \nAlternatives to simple width-averaged estimation of bedload flux \nResearchers modelling downstream fining using fractional SRMs have generally treated \nchannel cross-sections as rectangular, and used a single shear stress value and bed grain-size \ndistribution (Hoey and Ferguson, 1994; Cui et al., 1996; Ferguson et al., 2001; Talbot and \nLapointe, 2002). The width-averaged calculation is then on the lines of (10) above (Qa, the \nspecial case b = 0 of the general model) except that fluxes are calculated separately for each \nsize fraction of the bed. Clearly there will be some underestimation of total flux (and also \ncompetence) if in reality the channel has above-average shear stress in some places. The bias \nis likely to be greatest in relatively wide sections where the mean stress estimated from the \ndepth-slope product is low but there is substantial transport in one or more narrow talwegs. \nFerguson et al. (2001) found that agreement between observed and simulated downstream \nfining and aggradation rate was better on the whole when the same width was used for every \nFerguson2003Geomorphology.doc  page 9 \nsection, on the argument that only part of a wide section is hydraulically effective. But the \npresent model may be helpful in checking the merits of more sophisticated alternatives to \nsimple width-averaging over the measured bankfull width.   \nNon-fractional SRM applications have often used the actual channel cross-section at each \nnode, calculated the water surface elevation and the corresponding wetted width, then applied \nthe width-averaged transport calculation only over the wetted width. This makes no difference \nin bankfull conditions, but should be a step in the right direction when estimating bedload \ntransport at lower stages. It can be treated analytically using the model of Figure 1, and yields \na flux estimator \n)11(\n2\n1\n)1(\n5.12\n5.0\n5.1\n\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b ++\u2212\u2212\u2212=\nbfbcffc\nbf\nkwaQ w  \nThis reduces to (10) when f = 0. For f >0 it is a function of c and f separately, so cannot be \nplotted as a function only of b and c+f as in Figures 2 and 3. It gives a higher estimate than \nQa, increasingly so for higher values of b. For gravel-bed conditions it always falls well short \nof the true flux as calculated using eq.9, but for sand-bed conditions it comes closer.  \nIt has been observed several times that bedload transport in braided gravel-bed rivers is \nconcentrated in confluences and other talwegs, sometimes to the extent that transport \nelsewhere is negligibly small in comparison (Mosley, 1982; Carson and Griffiths, 1987; \nPaola, 1996). Transport in meandering channels is also concentrated in high-\u03c4 areas, not \nalways in the deepest part of the pool because of the delayed crossover of flow, but at least \nnear the talweg on the margin of the point bar (e.g. Dietrich and Smith, 1984). This suggests \nthere may be merit in making use of the maximum depth, as well as the mean depth, in the \ncalculation of \u03c4av for use in a width-averaged treatment of bedload flux. Talbot and Lapointe \n(2002), in an application of Hoey and Ferguson\u2019s (1994) model, experimented with estimating \nshear stress from mean depth, maximum depth, or an average of these two, and found that the \naverage of the two gave the best results. The equivalent in the present context is to use the \nmean of \u03c4av and \u03c4max in the 1-D calculation. For c+f <1 this turns out to overestimate the true \nflux Q progressively with higher b. For c+f >1 it predicts zero flux for low b, underestimates \nQ for intermediate b, and overestimates for high b.  \nAnother possibility which turns out to work better is to ignore completely the shallow, low-\u03c4 \nparts of the channel and do a width-averaged calculation over the deeper areas only. Nicholas \n(2000) describes one such procedure that was developed by engineers in New Zealand. In the \npresent model an obvious way to do such a calculation is to consider only the proportion 1-b \nof the width in which \u03c4 > \u03c4av. This gives an estimator \n[ ] )12())(1(5.01\n)1(\n5.1\n5.0\n5.1\nfcbb\nb\nawhQd +\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212=\n \nFor b = 0 this reduces to the standard width-averaged estimator Q0, but for non-rectangular \nchannels it gives a higher estimate than Qa for all but very low values of c+f.  \nFigure 4 compares the simple (Qa, eq.10), wetted-width (Qw, eq.11), and deep-areas-only (Qd, \neq.12) width-averaged estimators of bedload flux with the exact width-integrated flux (Q, \neq.9) for different degrees of variability in \u03c4 as indexed by b. The plot shows fluxes for c = f = \n0, which represents a sand-bed river at bankfull discharge, and c+f = 0.8 which represents \neither a gravel-bed river at bankfull flow (c = 0.8, f = 0) or a sandier river at lower flow \n(c = 0.4 and f = 0.4, or c = 0 and f = 0.8). In all cases the width-averaged estimators under-\npredict the actual flux for all non-rectangular channels (b >0), but there are clear differences \nFerguson2003Geomorphology.doc  page 10 \nin the amount of bias both between methods and according to parameter values in the model. \nQw increases with b for below-bankfull flows, so is more accurate than Qa which ignores the \neffect of channel shape. The degree to which Qw underestimates the true flux is less for higher \nreductions in flow level (compare the curves for c = 0.4, f = 0.4 and c = 0, f = 0.8). However, \nin all circumstances with f >0 Qd is higher than Qw and is closer to the exact flux Q, while still \nunderestimating it. The one circumstance in which Qd is not the best of the estimators \ncompared here is c+f <0.2, i.e. a sand-bed river at or close to bankfull level. As seen in the top \npart of Figure 4, in these conditions Qd dips slightly below Qa for intermediate shape factors, \nthough neither estimator is seriously in error. \nFor all gravel-bed cases, therefore, and also for sand-bed rivers below bankfull, it appears that \nignoring the parts of the channel with low shear stress gives a more accurate indication of true \nbedload flux than does averaging over the bankfull width or the actual wetted width at the \ngiven discharge. This finding has implications for operational computations using SRMs. \nWhich width-averaged estimator of bedload flux performs best on a patchy bed depends on \nthe degree of correlation between the spatial variation in applied shear stress and that in \ncritical shear stress. For random or near-random patchiness, it is clear from a comparison of \nFigures 3 and 4 that the deeper-areas average Qd remains much less biased than the bankfull \nor wetted-width averages Qa and Qw. However, in a channel with strong fining upwards, Qd \nwill overestimate and Qw may get closer to the true flux. \nDiscussion and conclusions \nBecause bedload transport rate varies nonlinearly with excess shear stress \u03c4-\u03c4c, the total \nbedload flux in a river depends not only on the mean values of \u03c4 and \u03c4c but also on their \nspatial variances within the domain of the calculation. The existence of spatial variation in \nflux has obvious implications for the design of bedload sampling programmes, but attention is \nrestricted here to the implications for numerical calculations using bedload formulae. In some \napplications the calculation may be for a single cross section and only lateral variation \nmatters, but in sediment routing models applied to long stretches of river the effective domain \nof the bedload calculation for section i is the channel area extending from midway between \nsections i-1 and i to midway between i and i+1. Local longitudinal variability, for example \nbetween pools and riffles, may then become relevant.  \nOther things being equal, greater variability in either \u03c4 or \u03c4c leads to greater flux. But although \nthe existence of this effect is undeniable, its magnitude is uncertain. There is virtually no \nempirical evidence; to the best of my knowledge nobody has measured bedload flux in either \nnatural channels or flumes with the same mean values of \u03c4 and \u03c4c but different variances, and \nindeed there is very little data of any kind on within-channel variation in \u03c4. In the absence of \nexperimental data one has to fall back on calculations. Paola (1996) and Nicholas (2000) did \nso using general models fitted to specific flume experiments and field sites respectively, and \nusing flow depth as an imperfect surrogate for shear stress. But to arrive at a wider assessment \nof the phenomenon one must either amass more and more such case studies, covering a wide \nrange of conditions, or resort to a purely theoretical approach in which parameters indexing \nthe amount and nature of spatial variability in \u03c4 and \u03c4c are varied while other river properties \nare kept constant. The latter approach has been taken here.  \nBy devising a model with a general analytical solution I have been able to investigate how \ntotal bedload flux depends on four key aspects of channel configuration: the degree of lateral \nvariation in \u03c4, represented by the parameter b in the model; the extent to which mean \u03c4c \napproaches mean \u03c4, represented by c; the reduction in flow stage below bankfull, represented \nby f; and the nature and degree of bed patchiness, which determine the lateral variance of \u03c4c. \nFerguson2003Geomorphology.doc  page 11 \nIn turn, this allows an evaluation of the performance of width-averaged estimators of bedload \nflux as used in 1-D sediment routing models. There are three main conclusions.  \n(1) With all else equal, bedload flux increases with the variance of \u03c4. The effect is \nprogressively stronger as c+f increases, which corresponds to moving from sand-bed rivers at \nbankfull flow to lower flows in sand-bed rivers, then bankfull flows in gravel-bed rivers, and \nfinally lower flows in gravel-bed rivers. In the gravel-bed cases there can be at least a 5-fold \ndifference in flux according to the variance of \u03c4. This result is not surprising. The root of the \nphenomenon is the nonlinearity of the bedload transport law, and this is greatest when \u03c4 \u2248 \u03c4c \nso that a small increase in \u03c4 makes the difference between no transport and some, or a low rate \nand a much higher rate. In terms of geometry rather than flow, a cross-section with one or \nmore deep talwegs will have locally high transport rates per unit width, and this will have \nmost effect on the total bedload conveyance when there is little or no transport over the rest of \nthe width.      \n(2) The effect of bed patchiness depends less on the variance of \u03c4c than on the degree of \ncorrelation between \u03c4c and \u03c4. Random patchiness increases bedload flux, especially in \nchannels without much lateral variation in \u03c4 where the flux may be doubled if there is a high \ndegree of random variability; in more variable hydraulic conditions the effect is relatively \nsmall. In contrast, perfect fining upwards of bed material (and its corollary, armouring of \ntalwegs) reduces bedload flux, more so in channels where there is substantial variation in \u03c4. \nReal-world situations will fall somewhere between these end-member scenarios. In most \nsituations this probably means the river will convey less bedload than it would without \npatches, but in near-uniform hydraulic conditions the opposite might apply. The limited field \nevidence in the literature (Mosley, 1982, 1983; Seal and Paola, 1995) suggests correlations \nbetween bed grain size and flow depth are weak, but these studies were all for braided rivers \nand may not generalise to other morphologies. There is a need for further field research on \nthis issue. \n(3) Simple width-averaging over the full channel width severely underestimates bedload flux \nin channels with substantial lateral variation in \u03c4, except when it is accompanied by a \nmatching variation in \u03c4c on the lines of the classic point-bar fining-upwards model. Averaging \nonly over the wetted width helps when flow is below the bankfull level, but merely reduces \nthe degree of underestimation; estimates remain biased downwards to an appreciable extent. \nAveraging only over parts of the channel with above-average depth or \u03c4 does better than \neither of the more obvious approaches in almost all circumstances. \nConclusions 1 and 2 are consistent with the results of Paola (1996) and Nicholas (2000), but \nqualify and extend them. Paola used a different, though equally general, analytical model \nwhich did not allow for variation in flow level. Since he only fitted his model to one data set \n(the braided-stream flume experiments of Ashmore, 1985) he was unable to generalise about \nthe extent to which \u03c4 variance inflates bedload flux, though he proposed a factor of ~3 for \nAshmore\u2019s data. The present analysis is very much in the spirit of Paola\u2019s work but the results \nshow that lateral variation does not increase bedload conveyance by any fixed factor; it \ndepends on all four aspects of the channel configuration that were identified above. Nicholas \n(2000) allowed for sub-bankfull flows but this necessitated re-fitting his statistical model for \neach water discharge of interest. His main conclusions were that higher variance of \u03c4 allowed \nsignificant bedload transport to begin at a lower water discharge and gave a higher flux than \nfor a rectangular section at the same water discharge, but with progressive convergence of \nfluxes at extremely high flow levels. All three findings are supported by the present analysis, \nbut with the qualification that the effects would be less pronounced for sand-bed rivers than \nfor gravel-bed channels such as the one Nicholas was studying.         \nFerguson2003Geomorphology.doc  page 12 \nConclusion 3 has implications for developers or users of both simple and fractional sediment \nrouting models. The present analysis did not extend to fractional transport calculations, \nthough work is in progress on this using numerical simulations rather than an analytical \nmodel. Preliminary results (Louise Sime, personal communication, 2002) suggest the effects \non flux are qualitatively the same as in the single-size analysis: it increases with variability in \n\u03c4, and may either increase or decrease with bed patchiness depending on the correlation with \n\u03c4. This implies that standard 1-D calculations will tend to underestimate bedload flux. \nUnderestimation by a constant factor would not be a great problem, since it would affect only \nthe pace of aggradation or degradation and not the longitudinal pattern of change in bed \nelevation or of associated surface fining or coarsening. Moreover, in longer-term studies of \ndownstream fining (e.g. Hoey and Ferguson, 1994; Robinson and Slingerland, 1998) the \ntimescale of development may not be known precisely and the main interest is in spatial \npatterns. But the lateral variance of \u03c4 is likely to alter from section to section in most rivers, in \nwhich case patterns of aggradation\/degradation could be mis-represented by width-averaged \ncomputations. The effects of spatial variability in \u03c4 and \u03c4c on the size selectivity of bedload \ntransport also need to be investigated. Paola and Seal (1995) showed theoretically that bed \npatchiness can enhance size selectivity, but hydraulic variability could have the opposite \neffect since locally high shear stresses will maintain coarser sediment in transport than would \nbe the case in a rectangular channel.  \nThere is obvious scope for investigating how the output from 1-D SRMs is affected by using \nalternatives to simple width-averaged transport calculations, and whether the changes are \nbeneficial. In effect what is needed is a way of allowing for what in a 1-D model is sub-grid-\nscale spatial variation in \u03c4 and \u03c4c. The present, single-size, analysis suggests that a width-\naveraged transport calculation which ignores all parts of the channel that are shallower than \nthe mean bankfull depth gives a good approximation to the true width-integrated bedload flux \nin most circumstances. It remains to be discovered whether it still does when applied to a \nlocal grain size distribution, as required in a fractional SRM, and whether the bedload size \ndistribution is then simulated sufficiently well to give acceptable accuracy in predictions of \nsurface fining or coarsening. There are also operational details to consider about just how \nsuch an approach would be implemented, including how to update the bed elevations defining \nthe cross-section: is aggradation\/degradation evenly distributed, or concentrated in the \ntalweg? Likewise, how is patchiness to be updated without a fully 2-D model? Yet again \nfurther research is needed. Here as throughout, questions of whether and how to allow for \nlateral variability are seen to be central to a better understanding of the imperfections of 1-D \nsediment routing models. \nAcknowledgments \nI thank Louise Sime for numerous discussions of these issues, comments on an early draft of \nthis paper, and permission to mention results from her PhD research concerning bed-elevation \ndistributions and patchiness and their implications for fractional transport.
