Content\nanalysis of 120 episodes of children\u2019s favourite pro-\ngrammes was used to quantify safe and risky behaviours,\nactual injuries and potential injuries. The gender of the\ncharacters portraying the behaviours was also analysed.\nResults: More risky behaviour was portrayed in the boys\u2019\nfavourite programmes (mean per episode = 6.40) than in\nthe girls\u2019 favourite programmes (mean = 2.57). There\nwere almost twice as many potential injuries (n = 310) as\nactual injuries (n = 157). Potential injuries were portrayed\nmore often by male characters (mean = 1.92) than\nfemale characters (mean = 0.98), mostly in the boys\u2019\nfavourite programmes. Actual injuries occurred more\noften to male characters (mean = 1.04) than to female\ncharacters (mean = 0.27) overall.\nConclusions: Television programmes preferred by this\nsample of boys portrayed male role models engaging in\nrisky behaviours and injuries more often than the\nprogrammes preferred by the sample of girls.\nUnintentional injuries are a leading cause of death\nand disability to children between the ages 5 and\n14 years.1 2 However, unintentional injuries are not\nequally distributed among children. One of the\nmost commonly reported disparities is between\nboys and girls, with higher unintentional injury\nrates for boys than girls.3\u20136\nPossible reasons for this male predominance have\nnot yet been thoroughly explained. There is\ngrowing evidence that boys and girls differ in their\nperception of risk, with boys rating dangerous\nactivities as being less risky.7 8 Also, by the age of 6\nyears, children rate boys as having a lower risk of\ninjury than girls, even though the actual injury rate\nfor boys is higher than for girls.9\nGender differences in socialisation practices may\nbe one of several explanations for gender differ-\nences in risk perceptions and injury rates. Parents\nare usually the primary source of socialisation and\nprovide the most readily available role models for\ntheir children. Children may also learn about\nsafety, risk and injury through observing adults\nand other children indirectly. Television is a\ncommonly available source of observational learn-\ning for children, especially those in high-income\ncountries. Children may learn from televised\nportrayals of safe and risky behaviour by observing\nbehaviour modelled by actors. Television has\nexpanded the variety of models available to\nchildren and exposed them to a wide range of\nbehaviours, many of which they may not other-\nwise have had the opportunity to observe.\nSocial cognitive theory10 11 explains how children\nlearn vicariously from media sources. Children may\nlearn new behaviours and the consequences (if\nany) of behaviours through television. Learned\nbehaviours may be facilitated through observing\ntelevised behaviours, and beliefs about the con-\nsequences of behaviours may be internalised.12 13\nAlthough there have been many studies on the\nportrayal of violent behaviour on television and its\npotential effects on children,14 there are far fewer\nstudies of the portrayal of safe and dangerous\nbehaviours on television in relation to uninten-\ntional injuries. Studies of injury depiction in British\ntelevision programmes are rare and mainly as a\nsecondary consideration in studies of television\nviolence.15\u201317\nPrevious studies of portrayal of risky behaviour\non TV have shown that risk is portrayed fre-\nquently18 and inaccurately19 in programmes and in\nadvertisements.20 Glik et al19 found that risky\nbehaviour was commonly depicted by characters\nin children\u2019s television programmes. Few of these\ncharacters suffered negative physical consequences\nas a result of risky behaviours or of being in\ndangerous environments. In contrast, behaviours\nthat would normally result in injury in real life did\nnot lead to injury for the television characters, and\nbystanders did not usually react to injurious\nbehaviour. This reduced the severity or seriousness\nof danger. Glik et al also reported that safe\nbehaviours were rarely depicted.\nFrom the above studies, it is clear that television\nprogrammes viewed by children portray injury-\nproducing behaviours frequently and inaccurately.\nAlthough it has been suggested by researchers that\nboys are more exposed to televised unsafe beha-\nviours, these studies did not compare the viewing\npreferences of boys and girls. The objectives of our\nstudy were (1) to analyse the injury-related\ncontent of children\u2019s television programmes pre-\nferred by boys and by girls and (2) to determine\nwhether there are more televised models of unsafe\nbehaviour in programmes preferred by boys.\nMETHOD\nPreliminary study\nParents of 320 schoolchildren aged between 4 and\n11 years were asked about their child\u2019s TV viewing\npreferences. The UK government report for the\nschool the children attended stated that the\neconomic context of the school was broadly\naverage and the children\u2019s achievement was good.\nOriginal article\n312 Injury Prevention 2009;15:312\u2013316. doi:10.1136\/ip.2008.019539\n on 27 October 2009 injuryprevention.bmj.comDownloaded from \nThe sample was representative of British schoolchildren with\nrespect to economic factors and scholastic achievement. All\nchildren present in school at the time of data collection were\ngiven a consent letter and questionnaire to take home to their\nparents. Questions concerned their child\u2019s age, gender and five\nfavourite television programmes in rank order. Pre-paid envel-\nopes were provided for questionnaires to be posted to the\nresearcher anonymously. A total of 187 replies were received\n(58.4%). There were 116 replies from parents with boys and 71\nreplies from parents with girls. The mean (SD) age of boys for\nwhom completed questionnaires were returned was 6.79 (1.707)\nyears and that for girls was 7.56 (2.05) years. Questionnaire results\nwere used to select a sample of TV programmes for analysis.\nSample of TV programmes\nPopularity rankings obtained from the parental questionnaires\nwere used to select 120 episodes from children\u2019s live and\nanimated TV programmes. A total of 24 TV programmes were\nselected. Five episodes from each programme were sampled to\nobtain sufficient representation of behaviours within each of\nthe programmes. All programmes were shown over a 2-month\nperiod in 2007.\nThe selection of programmes for analysis was organised into\nthree groups identified from the parental questionnaires. The\nfirst and second groups comprised the eight most popular TV\nprogrammes for girls and the eight most popular TV pro-\ngrammes for boys (table 1). In addition, several programmes\nwere popular among boys and girls; this formed a third group of\neight most popular programmes for girls and boys. The\ncomplete sample consisted of 40 episodes per group. The mean\n(SD) programme length was 18.75 (7.07) min, and the total\nmedia content analysed was 37.5 h; credits and advertisements\nwere not included. Although there were clear favourites\nidentified by the older and younger children, there was also\nconsiderable overlap. Therefore it was decided not to analyse\nfavourite programmes by age range for this relatively small\nsample of programmes.\nThe majority of programmes were animated. The percentage\nof live action programmes was 33.3% for the girls\u2019 favourite\nprogrammes, 22.2% for the boys\u2019 favourite programmes, and\n33.3% for the programmes preferred by boys and girls. Imports\nfrom the USA, Canada, Japan and European countries made up\n72.8% of the programmes and 28.2% were British made.\nMaterials\nA checklist (based on Glik et al19) was used to quantify the\nnumber of times risky behaviours, injuries, potential injuries\nand safe behaviours occurred within each episode. Qualitative\ninformation about the events portrayed was also noted. For\neach behaviour and injury, the gender and age group (adult or\nchild) of the person involved was coded (appendix 1 online).\nThe \u2018\u2018safe behaviour\u2019\u2019 category included any actions that depict\nsafe behaviour, eg wearing a cycle helmet, holding hands when\ncrossing the street. \u2018\u2018Risky behaviour\u2019\u2019 was defined as any\nbehaviour that reflects consequences of a serious nature and that\ncan result in either a potential or actual injury. \u2018\u2018Actual injury\u2019\u2019\ninvolved a description of the injury occurring, eg, head injury,\nscratches, burns. \u2018\u2018Potential injury\u2019\u2019 was defined as any risky\nbehaviour that has a high potential for causing injury (eg, falling,\nbeing hit with an object, crashing, fighting) but no injury is shown.\nEthics\nThe research was approved by the faculty ethics committee.\nThe ethical code of conduct of the British Psychological Society\nwas followed. Information for parents consisted of information\nabout the nature of the research, assurances of anonymity, their\nright to withdraw from the research, and contact details of the\nresearchers.\nProcedure\nAll TV programmes were video-recorded or accessed online so\nthat coders could rewind, re-view and pause the programmes.\nTwo coders, blind to the gender-based category, independently\nviewed and coded episodes using the full checklist to establish\ncoding reliability. After pilot studies, a high inter-coder\nagreement (85.42%) was reached on the preliminary coding.\nDiscrepancies between coders were discussed until 100%\nagreement was reached. The full set of episodes was coded\nafter establishment of full coder reliability.\nThe number of safe behaviours, risky behaviours, actual\ninjuries and potential injuries per episode were compared across\nthe three favourite TV programme groups: programmes\npreferred by girls, programmes preferred by boys, programmes\npreferred by girls and boys (n = 120). Also, comparisons were\nmade between male and female characters using programmes\nthat depicted humans and omitting those that portrayed\nanimal, robot and other non-human characters (n = 85).\nAnalysis of variance was used to make quantitative comparisons\nusing SPSS V14. All post hoc analyses used Bonferroni\ncorrections to avoid type 1 errors.\nRESULTS\nSafe behaviours\nThe mean number of safe behaviours per episode was low (fig 1)\nand there was no statistically significant difference between the\nfavourite programme groups in amount of safe behaviour\nportrayed. Most of the safe behaviour was performed by adults\n(66.6%).\nRisky behaviours\nMore risky behaviour was portrayed in the boys\u2019 favourite\nprogrammes than in the other favourite programme groups\n(fig 1). Post hoc tests showed that more risky behaviour was\nportrayed in boys\u2019 favourite programmes than in girls\u2019 favourite\nprogrammes (p,0.001, CI = 99.9% 6.16 to 1.48). Also more\nrisky behaviour was portrayed in boys\u2019 favourite programmes\nthan in the girls\u2019 and boys\u2019 favourite programmes (p,0.04,\nCI = 96% 0.08 to 4.67). However, there was no significant\ndifference between girls\u2019 favourite programmes and girls\u2019 and\nboys\u2019 favourites. Most of the risky behaviour was performed by\nadults (52.70%).\nTable 1 Sample of programmes\nType Girls\u2019 favourites Boys\u2019 favourites\nGirls\u2019 and boys\u2019\nfavourites\nLive action Suite Life of Zach and\nCody\nChuckleVision\nZoey 101\nPower Rangers\nMr Bean\nTracey Beaker*\nLazy Town\nMy Parents are Aliens\nAnimation Bratz\nMeg and Mog\nPeppa Pig\nWinx Club\nInspector Gadget\nMona the Vampire*\nYu Gi Oh\nTransformers\nBikermice from Mars\nSonic Underground\nPokemon\nThe Simpsons\nFairly Odd Parents\nSpongeBob\nSquarePants\nScooby-Doo*\nTom and Jerry\n*Programmes rated in the top 10 children\u2019s programmes by the weekly Broadcast\npublication in 2007 (www.broadcastnow.co.uk).

Post hoc tests found\nmore actual injuries were portrayed in boys\u2019 favourite pro-\ngrammes than in the other two groups (p,0.001, CI = 99.9%\n0.66 to 2.58 when compared with girls\u2019 favourite programmes\nand p,0.02, CI = 98% 0.16 to 2.09 when compared with girls\u2019\nand boys\u2019 favourite programmes). There was no significant\ndifference between the girls\u2019 favourite programmes and the girls\u2019\nand boys\u2019 favourite programmes.\nThere were almost twice as many potential injuries (310 in\ntotal) as actual injuries (157) (fig 2). In contrast with the\nportrayal of actual injuries, the number of potential injuries did\nnot differ significantly across the three groups of TV pro-\ngrammes.\nComparisons by gender of character\nFor comparisons by gender of character, episodes with non-\nhuman characters were omitted from the analysis. There was\nno statistically significant difference between male and female\ncharacters in the number of safe behaviours performed per\nepisode and no interaction between gender of character and\nprogramme group (fig 3A).\nMale characters portrayed significantly more risky behaviours\nthan female characters overall (fig 3B). There was also a\nsignificant interaction between gender of performer and\nprogramme group. More risky behaviours were portrayed by\nmale characters in the favourite programmes for boys than the\nfavourite programmes for girls (p,0.001, CI = 99.9% 2.35 to\n6.40) and the favourite programmes for girls and boys (p,0.001,\nCI = 99.9% 1.38 to 3.01). There was no significant difference in\nthe amount of risky behaviour portrayed by female characters\nacross the three favourite programme groups.\nThere were significantly more actual injuries per episode to\nmale characters than to female characters (fig 4A). Post hoc\nanalyses showed that the number of actual injuries to male\ncharacters was higher in the boys\u2019 favourite programmes than in\nthe girls\u2019 favourite programmes (p,0.001, CI = 99.9% 1.07 to\n2.78) and the favourite programmes for girls and boys (p,0.001,\nCI = 99.9% 0.97 to 2.68). There was no significant difference in\nthe amount of actual injury portrayed by female characters\nacross the three favourite programme groups.\nThere were more potential injuries to male characters than\nfemale characters overall (fig 4B). Post hoc tests showed more\npotential injuries for male characters in the boys\u2019 favourite\nprogrammes than in the girls\u2019 favourites (p,0.02, CI = 98.0%\n0.18 to 3.19). There were no significant differences in the\namount of potential injury portrayed by female characters\nacross the three programme groups.\nPresence and actions of bystanders\nAlthough bystanders were often portrayed at the scene of an\nactual or potential injury event (90.10% of the time), in most\ncases (72.5%) they gave no help. There was no significant\ndifference in the amount of help given to male and female\ncharacters.\nDISCUSSION\nThe results indicate that television programmes preferred by our\nsample of boys portrayed risky behaviours more often than the\nprogrammes preferred by our sample of girls. Programmes\npreferred by boys also portrayed more injuries. The characters\nportraying more risky behaviour, actual injuries and potential\ninjuries were predominantly male. These results support\nprevious findings19 that male characters were more likely to\nportray injury than female characters in children\u2019s television\nprogrammes.\nThe results were consistent with those of previous research-\ners19 21 in that risky behaviours were often portrayed across all\nfavourite programme groups. There were more potential\ninjuries than actual injuries overall. Although bystander\ncharacters were present during the injury events, they rarely\nrendered help. Safe behaviours were less often portrayed, and\nthere were no gender differences in amount of safe behaviours\nshown. Overall, television programmes enjoyed by children\nFigure 1 Comparison between mean number of safe and risky\nbehaviours per episode for girls\u2019 favourite TV programmes, boys\u2019\nfavourite TV programmes and for girls\u2019 and boys\u2019 favourite TV\nprogrammes.

For example, live action programmes included\ncharacters slipping, falling from a height and being hit by\nobjects without being hurt. Male characters were also shown\nclimbing a building using a damaged rope or a loose drainpipe\nwith no adverse effects. With reference to social cognitive\ntheory, televised characters provide sources of learning new\nrisky behaviours for children and may reinforce such learning by\nportraying few if any negative consequences of risky behaviour.\nIn addition, most risky behaviours were performed by male\ncharacters (mostly men), providing the most appropriate role\nmodels for boys. More risky behaviour, actual injury and\npotential injury were portrayed by male characters in the\nprogrammes preferred by boys.\nSocialisation of risky behaviour involves more than watching\ntelevision programmes. It would be too simplistic to assume\nthat boys take more risks than girls because they view more\ntelevised risk. Boys may prefer programmes portraying more\nrisks because they provide more excitement. Also, not all that is\nobserved on television or elsewhere will be learned or modelled,\nand children do not necessarily absorb television messages\npassively.22\nHowever, there is convincing evidence that televised risky\nbehaviour can and does affect children\u2019s risk-taking.23 Children\nhave been reported to imitate popular stunt-riders24 and\nwrestlers.25 Also, Potts et al23 found that 6\u20139-year-old children\nwho viewed risk-taking behaviour on television showed an\nincrease in risk-taking. Potts and Swisher26 found that the\ntelevised portrayal of safety models to 5\u20138-year-old children\ndecreased their willingness to take physical risks and increased\ntheir ability to identify hazards. Although boys had higher levels\nof risk-taking overall in these two studies,23 26 boys and girls\nwere equally affected by both risky and safe television content.\nThe authors concluded that boys are not more influenced than\ngirls by televised portrayals of risk. They proposed that boys\nmay be more exposed to televised portrayals of risk than girls.\nThis increased exposure may amplify already existing gender\ndifferences in risk-taking.\nThe main limitations of this study are that the sample size of\n120 episodes is small in comparison with some previous studies.\nAlso, the comparison of boys\u2019 favourite programmes with girls\u2019\nfavourite programmes was based on reports from a small sample\nof 187 parents. As children\u2019s favourite television programmes\nFigure 3 (A) Mean number of safe\nbehaviours per episode portrayed by male\nand female characters. Error bars indicate\n\u00a11 SE.

However, our study is one of\nthe first to directly compare the television viewing choices of\nboys and girls in relation to injury portrayal. Also, it is one of\nthe few studies of unintentional injury portrayal in UK\nchildren\u2019s television programmes. The method used cannot\ndetermine the extent to which children\u2019s injury rates are\ninfluenced by modelling the unsafe behaviour of television\ncharacters. Therefore further research is needed into the\nrelationship between television viewing and child injury rates\nas well as the effect of repeatedly showing unsafe behaviour\nwith no injurious consequences.\nUnfortunately, risky behaviour on television is more effective\nin attracting young viewers27 so it is unlikely to be reduced in\nchildren\u2019s television content. However, parents could take the\nopportunity to discuss the contrasts between risk-taking on\ntelevision and in real life. This is particularly important for\nyounger children, as those aged less than 8 years often have\ndifficulties in making a distinction between fantasy and reality\nin television programmes.28\nOur findings may be helpful to parents in influencing their\nchildren\u2019s programme choices. Some programmes (eg, Power\nRangers) showed considerably more risky behaviours than\nothers. Programme ratings for risky behaviour would help\nparents to make informed decisions about their children\u2019s\ntelevision viewing. For health educators, it may be important to\ninclude information about the media depictions of injury risk in\ntheir safety education information and training. The amount of\ntelevision children watch has been found to be higher in\nhouseholds where children have a TV in their bedroom and\nwhere parents do not set specific rules for TV viewing.29 Health\nprofessionals should inform parents of the potentially higher\nrisk of unintentional injury to boys and consider encouraging\nparents to limit children\u2019s television viewing, especially un-\nsupervised viewing in children\u2019s bedrooms.\nCompeting interests: None.\nEthics approval: Obtained.\nProvenance and peer review: Not commissioned; externally peer reviewed.\nREFERENCES\n1.
