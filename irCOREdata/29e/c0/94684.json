Huntington himself explicitly refers to terrorism in the conflict between \nspecific civilizations, and particularly so in the clash between the Islamic civilization \nand the West. We confront his hypotheses with ones derived from our theory of the \nstrategic logic of international terrorism. We predict more terrorism against nationals \nfrom countries whose government supports the government of the terrorists\u2019 home \ncountry. Similar to Huntington, we also predict excessive terrorism on Western targets, \nbut because of the high strategic value of attacking Westerners, not because of inter-\ncivilizational conflict per se. Contrary to Huntington, our theory does not suggest that \ngroups from the Islamic civilization commit more terrorist acts against nationals from \nother civilizations in general. Nor do we expect a general increase in inter-civilizational \nterrorism after the end of the Cold War. Our empirical analysis \u2013 based on estimations \nin a directed dyadic country sample from 1969 to 2005 \u2013 finds broad support for our \ntheory: foreign political support generates more terrorism against nationals of the \nsupporting foreign country. Our results also suggest that the Rest-West and the Islam-\nWest dyads indeed encounter significantly more terrorism, which is in line with \nHuntington, but not necessarily inconsistent with our own theory either. However, in \ncontradiction to Huntington we do not find that there is generally more terrorism from \nthe Islamic against other civilizations. Also, we find no evidence for a general structural \nbreak in the pattern of international terrorism after the end of the Cold War. \n2 \nThis struggle has been called a clash of civilizations. In truth, it is a \nstruggle for civilization. \nGeorge W. Bush 2006 \nAl Qaeda could not be happier than in a real clash among \ncivilizations. \nGiandomenico Picco 2005: 14 \nThe current struggle against Islamist terrorism is not a clash of \ncivilizations.  \nJoseph Nye 2004: 17 \nIt is not \u2026 in the interest of the West to view this as a clash of \nWestern and Muslim civilizations. \nAhmed S. Hashim 2001: 29 \nThis is no less than a clash of civilizations \u2013 the perhaps irrational \nbut surely historic reaction of an ancient rival against our Judeo-\nChristian heritage, our secular present, and the worldwide expansion \nof both.  \nBernard Lewis 1990: 60. \n \n1.  Introduction  \nAfter the end of the Cold War, conflicts between civilizations struggling for influence \non a new world order pose the greatest danger for international stability and peace. This, \nat least, is the central tenet of Samuel Huntington\u2019s famous and best-selling book The \nClash of Civilizations (Huntington 1996) and his earlier Foreign Affairs article \n(Huntington 1993a).  \nRecently, events such as the terrorist attacks of 9\/11, and the bombings in Bali, \nMadrid and London were interpreted by many as striking evidence for Huntington\u2019s \nparadigm. Yet, the wide attention Huntington\u2019s works has attracted in public discussion \nof international terrorism (Ahmed and Forst 2005; United Nations 2006) contrasts with \nits reception in the empirical academic debate in at least two respects. First, scholarly \nwork that has tested Huntington\u2019s theoretical predictions has focused exclusively on \n3 \npatterns of militarized inter-state dispute, inter-state and civil wars. To our knowledge, \nno test exists of hypotheses derived from Huntington\u2019s work on terrorism. And second, \ntests of Huntington\u2019s arguments have typically failed to find evidence for a clash of \ncivilizations.1\nHowever, empirical tests of Huntington are hampered by the fact that the term \n\u201cclash\u201d is nowhere clearly defined in his work and that, depending on the pair of \ncivilizations looked at, it means many different things to Huntington. Given the \nambiguity of the term, tests that fail to find that inter-civilizational dyads in general are \nmore likely to experience one particular type of conflict do not establish fully \nconvincing evidence against Huntington. More importantly, existing scholarship has \nneglected that, for some civilizational dyads for which Huntington predicts a high level \nof conflict, he himself mentions terrorism, as in the clash of \u201cRest versus West\u201d, or even \nexplicitly emphasizes the use of terrorism, as in the clash of \u201cIslam versus Rest\u201d and \n\u201cIslam versus West\u201d. Our test of Huntington\u2019s predictions, then, provides additional \ninsights as to the relevance of his paradigm. \nRather than merely testing predictions derived from Huntington\u2019s work, however, \nwe also compare his paradigm to a strategic theory of international terrorism. Our the-\nory argues that the leaders of terror groups are predominantly rational and act \nstrategically to reach their goal of gaining political influence on the political system of \ntheir home country. We argue that terror group leaders from other civilizations have a \ngeneral interest in attacking Western targets due to their high strategic value, and a \nspecific interest in attacking targets from those foreign countries whose government \nlends support to the government of the terrorists\u2019 home country. We find broad support \nfor our strategic theory as well as some limited support for Huntington\u2019s predictions in a \ndirected country dyad sample over the period 1969 to 2005. \n4 \n2. Huntington and the Clash of Civilizations Hypothesis \n2.1 A new Era in World Politics? \nHuntington\u2019s clash of civilizations hypothesis has many facets (Huntington 1993a, \n1996). If there is, however, one central hypothesis in his work it is this: The dominant \nsource of conflict will shift from the clash of ideologies during the Cold War period (li-\nberal democracy vs. communism) to the clash between nations and groups of different \ncivilizations after the end of the Cold War: \u201c\u2026conflicts between groups in different \ncivilizations will be more frequent, more sustained and more violent than conflicts \nbetween groups in the same civilization\u201d (Huntington 1993a: 48). \nHe defines civilizations as \u201cthe highest cultural grouping of people and the broadest \nlevel of cultural identity people have\u201d, being \u201cdifferentiated from each other by history, \nlanguage, culture, tradition, and, most important, religion\u201d (ibid.: 25). Huntington \ndistinguishes seven, or possibly eight civilizations \u2013 Western, Sinic, Japanese, Islamic, \nHindu, Slavic-Orthodox, Latin American and, possibly, African. He posits that \ncivilizational differences \u201care the product of centuries\u201d and \u201cfar more fundamental than \ndifferences among political ideologies and political regimes\u201d and are therefore \u201cless \nmutable and hence less easily compromised and resolved than political and economic \nones\u201d (Huntington 1993a: 25 and 27). Moreover, such differences are not merely an \nabstract construction: \u201c[that] civilizations are meaningful entities accords with the way \nin which people see and experience reality\u201d (Huntington 1993b: 194). \nHe then goes on to argue that the Cold War had artificially plastered over and \ndampened inter-civilizational conflicts. The end of the Cold War allowed these conflicts \nto emerge and gain strength. They also draw strength from economic modernization, \nwhich tends to weaken the nation-state as a source of identity. This, in turn, leads to a \nrevival of religion as an alternative source of identity. As Huntington (ibid.: 191f.) puts \nit: \u201cIn the modern world, religion is a central, perhaps the central, force that motivates \nand mobilizes people.\u201d Finally, the declining power of the Western civilization and the \nrising power of other civilizations allow the latter to challenge Western hegemony.  \n5 \nThroughout his work on inter-civilizational conflicts, Huntington remains reluctant \nto formulate testable predictions arising from his paradigm. This is ironic given he also \nstates that \u201ca crucial test of a paradigm\u2019s validity and usefulness is the extent to which \nthe predictions derived from it turn out to be more accurate than those from alternative \nparadigms\u201d (Huntington 1996: 37). Consequently, critics have charged his work with \nbeing ambiguous, inconsistent and sometimes self-contradictory (Russett, Oneal and \nCox 2000; Henderson and Tucker 2001; Gartzke and Gleditsch 2006). Due to space \nconstraints, we cannot engage with these arguments in great detail. Instead, we \nconcentrate on two aspects that are central to the focus of this paper: the conflict \nintensity of pairs of civilizations and the meaning of the term \u201cclash\u201d. \n2.2  Inter-civilizational Pairs and their Conflict Intensity \nOn top of his hypothesis of a general clash of civilizations, Huntington regards certain \ncivilizations and certain pairs of civilizations as more prone to conflict than others. Yet, \nHuntington\u2019s argumentation with respect to the conflict intensity of inter-civilizational \ndyads is not fully specified. His book provides a network graphic, which distinguishes \nthree degrees of conflict intensity (Huntington 1996: 245). Given that Huntington has \nidentified eight different civilizations, this results in 28 civilization dyads. However, he \nprovides information on the expected conflict intensity for only 17 out of these 28 \ndyads. Table 1 reproduces Huntington\u2019s predictions: \n \nTable 1 about here \n \nWe indicate the 11 civilization dyads for which Huntington does not provide an answer \nby a question mark \u2013 leaving open whether he means that these dyads are not conflictual \n(for reasons he does not discuss) and should therefore be coded 0 or whether his \nparadigm does not allow him to derive a prediction with respect to this dyad. \nHuntington provides full information on conflict intensity only for dyads that include \nthe West. This seems to result from his judgment that \u2013 as non-Western civilizations \nbecome increasingly self-assertive and Western countries attempt to maintain their \n6 \neconomic, political and military dominance \u2013 there will be increasing conflict between \n\u201cthe West versus the Rest\u201d (Huntington 1993a: 39). But Islam also stands out. He \nprovides information for five out of seven relations to other civilizations, four of which \nare highly conflictual. \n2.3  What does Clash mean? \nHuntington\u2019s theoretical imprecision is not limited to the matrix of inter-civilizational \nconflicts. He also remains unclear about his second most important term: clash. While \nhe states that clashes between civilizations will become the greatest threat to world \npeace and that \u201cthe fault lines between civilizations will be the battle lines of the future\u201d \n(Huntington 1993a: 22), the term is nowhere explicitly defined or thoroughly explained. \nRather, Huntington subsumes very different things under the same umbrella, depending \non specific civilization dyads looked at. For example, the clash between the West and \nJapan is mainly described in economic terms, the conflict between the Western and the \nSinic civilization mainly in military terms.  \nFor some civilizational combinations, Huntington mentions, almost in passing, the \nuse of terrorism as one form of conflict. In the clash between the Rest against the West, \nhe identifies terrorism (together with nuclear arms) as one of the two weapons of the \n\u201cnon-Western weak\u201d (Huntington 1996: 188). He refers much more explicitly to \nterrorism in his analysis of the Islamic civilization. For the clash between Islam and \nother civilizations, Huntington (2002: 3) states that \u201cwhile groups from all religions \nhave engaged in various forms of violence and terrorism, the figures make it clear that \nin the past decade Muslims have been involved in far more of these activities than \npeople of other religions\u201d. To this he adds a cross-reference to his (in)famous phrase of \n\u201cthe bloody borders of Islam\u201d from Huntington (1993a).2 He particularly stresses the \nuse of terrorism in relation to the asymmetric clash between Islam and the West. He \n(1996: 216) argues that \u201cfollowing the 1979 Iranian Revolution, an inter-civilizational \nquasi war developed between Islam and the West. (\u2026) [I]t is a quasi war because, apart \nfrom the Gulf War of 1990-91, it has been fought with limited means: terrorism on one \nside and air power, covert action, and economic sanctions on the other.\u201d \n7 \nHuntington does not provide a systematic explanation of why terrorism is a favorite \nweapon employed in these clashes. The reason given for the use of terrorism by other \ncivilizations against the West does not go beyond the observation that \u201cterrorism \nhistorically is the weapon of the weak\u201d (Huntington 1996: 187). His explanation of the \nextraordinary conflict intensity of Islam is not based on profound theoretical reasons \neither. He (1996: 263ff) perceives Islam as a \u201creligion of the sword\u201d with an absolutist \nideology that makes co-habitation with other religions extremely difficult. However, \nmany religions, not just Islam, can be and have historically been misused for the \npurpose of justifying terrorist violence (Rapoport 1984). Huntington also argues that \ngeopolitically the Islamic civilization has no clear borders but overlaps with most other \ncivilizations and is not dominated by a core state, causing conflict with both neighbors \nand within the Islamic world. However, this begs the question of why there is not \nexcessive terrorism from other civilizations on victims of Islamic countries. Moreover, \naccording to Huntington (1996: 135), the Latin American and African civilizations \nsimilarly miss a core state. Finally, and in Huntington\u2019s view most importantly, the \nlarge number of unemployed males between the age of 15 and 30 is a natural source of \nviolence both within the Islamic civilization and between it and other civilizations. Yet, \nmany developing countries from other civilizations experience similar problems. \nAccording to Huntington, one should expect a particularly strong clash between \nIslam and the West given a fourteen centuries old legacy of conflict. This conflict \nultimately stems from similarities in the aspirations of the two civilizations, e.g. as \nuniversalistic and missionary (Huntington 1996: 211), with simultaneous fundamental \ndifferences in culture and religion. \u201cThe underlying problem for the West\u201d, writes \nHuntington (1996: 217), \u201cis not Islamic fundamentalism. It is Islam, a different civiliza-\ntion whose people are convinced of the superiority of their culture and are obsessed with \nthe inferiority of their power.\u201d The Cold War period plastered over this conflict to some \nextent, but \u201cthe collapse of communism removed a common enemy of the West and \nIslam and left each the perceived major threat to the other.\u201d (Huntington 1996: 211). \n8 \n3. The Strategic Logic of International Terrorism \nIn this section, we provide a competing account of international terrorism to \nHuntington. We follow Bueno de Mesquita\u2019s (2006: 637) suggestion of a \u201cnatural \nprogression from macro-level accounts (\u2026) to the specification of their micro-\nfoundations\u201d. On the micro-level our theory makes a crucial distinction between the \nleaders of terror groups and their followers.3 We assume that terror leaders and \nfollowers come from the same population of ideologues and believers.4 What \ndifferentiates the two is their relative position within terror groups. On the macrolevel, \nour theory specified the conditions under which terror leaders of one country have a \nstrategic interest in attacking targets from foreign nations, even though their ultimate \ngoal is to gain influence on domestic political matters (see the next section). Our theory \nbuilds on the rational approach to identifying and explaining the causes of international \nterrorism in conflict over political influence (Crenshaw 1981, 1998, 2001; Pape 2003, \n2005; Neumann and Smith 2005, Kydd and Walter 2006). \n3.1. Terror Group Leaders \nThe leaders of terror groups are distinguished by having a crucial, decisive position in \nthe terror organization. They are the leaders and therefore behave predominantly \nstrategically. From their perspective, terrorism is a rational strategy in a political \nstruggle to achieve an end, not an end in itself. In other words, terror leaders \ninstrumentalize terror because they want to make the powerful respond \u2013 preferably in a \nway that changes the situation better to suit the interests of the terrorists. Terrorism is \nnot simply violence, often against civilians, in order to create fear. Rather, terrorism \naims at creating fear, because the induced fear will in turn lead somebody else to \nrespond in a way that makes it more likely that the terrorists will achieve their goals \n(Fromkin 1975: 693). \nWhat are the goals of terror leaders? The exact answer depends on the type of terror \norganization. However, practically all terror leaders want to achieve some fundamental \nchange in policies, or even a change in the political regime of, their home country or the \nwider region.5 Terror group leaders thus strive to gain political influence and, \n9 \nultimately, control. This generic end-goal unites terror groups despite extreme \ndifferences in their ideologies. \nFollowing Rapoport (2003) and Shugart (2006), we can distinguish three over-\nlapping \u201cwaves of modern terrorism\u201d:6 After the anti-colonial\/ethno-nationalist and \nradical left waves, religious terrorism is now dominating, with Islam \u201cat the heart of the \nwave\u201d (Rapoport 2003: 61; similarly Pedahzur, Eubank and Weinberg 2002: 146). The \nanti-colonial and ethno-nationalist groups wanted national independence from colonial \noccupiers or secession for their ethnic group, and they were often successful. The \nradical left groups wanted to overthrow capitalism, which failed spectacularly. The \nIslamic terror groups want to force governments in Islamic countries to adopt policies in \nline with their own radical interpretation of Islam. Some are more ambitious still and \nwant to topple any government that prevents, often by violent means, the Islamists from \nincreasing their influence and grip on political power (Sedqwick 2004). \nIf fundamental political change is the ultimate goal of terror leaders, why do they \nresort to terror rather than other forms of political action and why does terror represent a \nsuitable instrument for achieving their goals? Terror leaders typically face one or more \nof three constraints. The first is the exclusion from the political process; the second is \ninsufficient support among the wider population; while the third is the asymmetry in \nstrength or power between the government and the terror group (Crenshaw 1981; \nHoffman 2002). \nTerrorism is also instrumental in achieving intermediate goals in the long struggle \nfor the ultimate goal of violent political change. First, terror raises the costs of political \nstability. Terror attacks create a feeling of insecurity, which provokes the targeted \ngovernment to invest more heavily in security policies. Second, terror attacks stimulate \npolitical responses that worsen the situation of the terror group\u2019s actual and potential \nsupporters (Rosendorff and Sandler 2004). As we will see in the next section, this can \nhelp in the recruitment of terrorists. And third, terror attacks generate media attention, \nwhich allows the terror leaders to gain voice and spread their ideology. Again, this will \nfacilitate the recruitment of followers. \n10 \nThus, besides hitting the targeted enemy, terrorism serves terror leaders in their \nstruggle to gather support and recruit followers. This is essential for the functioning and \nthe success of the terror group (Siqueira and Sandler 2006). Terrorists not only need \nshelter, raise the financial means to buy weaponry and to run training camps, they also \nneed individuals willing to serve as terrorists. The leaders of terror groups (while often \ntoying with weapons in front of TV cameras) rarely fight their terror campaigns \nthemselves. Rather, they usually act exclusively as terror group leaders. In other words, \nwhile they have ultimate strategic goals, perhaps the most important intermediate aim of \nterror attacks is to increase their support and recruit followers, to whom we turn now. \n3.2.  Followers \nTerror followers are individuals who are attracted to the leaders\u2019 ideology, but are not in \na decisive or crucial position within the terror organization. Rather, they are the soldiers \nof the leaders and follow specified or unspecified commands, which may include the \ncommand of self-sacrifice in a suicide terror mission (see Pape 2003). In contrast to the \ngroup leaders, terror followers need not behave predominantly strategically or \nrationally. They may be driven by several, complex and varied motivations that may \nalso depend on contextual and sometimes very personal circumstances (Post 1998; \nVictoroff 2005). We suggest, however, that three factors are essential in the successful \nrecruitment of terrorists: ideological appeal, peer acknowledgement and political \ngrievances. \nIf individuals do not share the ideology of the terror leaders, they will not support \nthe terror group to reach its strategic goals, because under such circumstances their \nutility will decline if the group reaches its ultimate goal. The more appealing the terror \nleaders\u2019 ideology and their strategic goals to parts of the population, the easier is re-\ncruitment. The radical left terror groups of the past failed not least because their \nideology and goals did not appeal to the wider population and they therefore remained \nsplinter groups.  \nSecond, joining a terror group becomes more likely if potential followers receive \nsome peer acknowledgement for doing so. While terrorists almost by definition are \n11 \noutcasts, the greater the acknowledgement they receive among the small group of direct \nsupporters and among the wider population, the more they can feel justified in \nperpetrating acts that are normally regarded as heinous (Moghadam 2003; Speckhard \nand Ahkmedova 2006). Targeting attacks against innocent civilians no matter what their \npersonal circumstances and political attitudes is difficult to justify. Peer ac-\nknowledgement means that terrorists are not exclusively regarded as ruthless and ultra-\nviolent criminals, but, by some at least, as heroic fighters for the righteous cause. The \nmore peer acknowledgement terrorists receive, the more they will be able to overcome \nthe scruples that might otherwise prevent them from joining terror groups. For these \nreasons, terror leaders invest in communication with their own peers, with the aim of \nraising their acknowledgement.7 Media attention is of utmost importance as it helps the \nterror leaders to spread their propaganda to potential new recruits (Rohner and Frey \n2007). \nFinally, political grievances again raise the ideological appeal of terror groups. \nSuch grievances spur hatred and anger and the wish to revenge oneself on those who are \nperceived as being the cause of grievance (Rosendorff and Sandler 2004; Richardson \n2006). According to Bueno de Mesquita (2005: 518) the ideological benefits that \nindividuals derive from joining terror groups increase with reprisals from a regime \n\u201cblamed for the loss of freedom, dignity and rights\u201d. Interviews with terrorists reveal \nhow grievances inflicted by counter-terrorist measures provide a powerful incentive to \njoin terror groups (Stern 2003; Khosrokhavar 2005). \n4.  Differences between Huntington\u2019s Paradigm and our Strategic Theory \nIn this section, we identify where Huntington\u2019s paradigm and our theory make different \npredictions on patterns of inter-civilizational terrorism, which can be tested against each \nother. Based on Huntington, one would expect excessive terrorism from non-Western \ncivilizations against Western targets, excessive terrorism emanating from the Islamic \ncivilization and directed against non-Islamic civilizations, as well as excessive Islamic \nterrorism against Western targets. \n12 \nAs concerns our own theory, we focus on why terrorists can be drawn toward \nattacking foreign targets. Our theory posits that terror leaders aim for political influence \nin their country or wider region. Accordingly, one would expect that the victims of ter-\nrorism come mainly from the same country as the terrorists. This is indeed the case. \nWhile there is no dataset that comprehensively covers both international and purely \ndomestic terrorism, estimates are that around 90 per cent of terrorism is in fact \ndomestic, in the sense that the terrorists and their victims share the same nationality and \nno other aspect of the terror attack is international (Enders 2007: 832). \nIf terror leaders are focused on domestic political change, the question is why do \nthey attack foreign targets as well and why do they attack victims from certain foreign \ncountries much more than from others? Based on our strategic theory, we would expect, \nfirst, more terrorism directed against Western targets. With terror leaders dependent on \nmedia and public attention, attacking Western targets provides clear strategic benefits \ngiven that most of the media corporations have headquarters and their major customer \nbase in Western countries. Attacking Western targets is certainly making it into the \nglobal news. It is also very difficult for the government of the terrorists\u2019 home country \nto ignore such attacks and, since terrorists want the government to respond to their \nterror, attacking Westerners has strategic value. \nSecond, our theory also predicts more terrorism directed against targets from \nother countries if the foreign government supports and stabilizes the government of the \nterrorists\u2019 home country. Such support can take the form of, among other things, \nmilitary alliances, military intervention in civil wars, arms transfers and economic aid. \nIndeed, some governments only survive with foreign support. In such cases, it can be \nthe strength of the foreign power rather than the strength of the domestic government \nthat prevents terror leaders from reaching their aims. The more the home government \ndepends on foreign support, the more important the foreign power becomes as an \nobstacle to the terror leaders. If the terrorist attacks on foreign powers force the foreign \npower to reduce its support for the government the terrorists seek to overthrow, then the \nterror leaders get closer to their strategic goal. \n13 \nThis prediction of our theory holds true independently of the civilizational \nbelonging of either the terrorists or their victims. For example, our theory predicts that \nRussian support to Central Asian Republics who face a domestic conflict with Islamist \nterrorists will increase terror against Russian targets. Similarly, American support to \nColombia will increase anti-American terrorism by Colombian terrorists. According to \nHuntington (1996: 245) the relationship between the Latin and the Western civilization \nshould be relatively peaceful, yet patterns of international terrorism show very \nsubstantial terrorist activity directed from Latin American terror groups against Western \ntargets (around 14 per cent of all international and around 26 per cent of all inter-\ncivilizational terrorist incidents during the period 1969 to 2005 falls into this category). \nOur strategic theory predicts such patterns given the very large extent of Western and \nparticularly US support to Latin American governments in conflict with domestic terror \ngroups, whereas Huntington\u2019s Clash of Civilizations paradigm cannot adequately \naccount for these patterns. The same goes for the relationship between the West on the \none hand and the Hindu and Sinic civilizations on the other hand, which according to \nHuntington (1996: 245) are conflictual and very conflictual, respectively. Yet, the level \nof anti-Western terrorism originating from these civilizations is minuscule (around 0.4 \nand 1 per cent of all international terrorist incidents, respectively). Our strategic theory \nwould predict such low terrorist activity given the relatively low extent of which \ngovernments of Hindu and Sinic states depend on Western foreign support. \nOur strategic theory is, however, not necessarily inconsistent with all of \nHuntington\u2019s predictions. For example, it is not inconsistent with his prediction of \nexcessive terrorist activity from non-Western terrorists against Western targets or by \nIslamic terrorists on Western targets, even though it provides very different reasons for \nsuch activity. For Huntington, such terrorism is rooted in a deep and long-running \ncivilizational conflict. For us, terrorists do not attack foreigners simply because they are \nforeign or from a different civilization. Terror leaders are not drawn to violence for \nviolence sake, even if directed against other civilizations. Inter-civilizational terrorism is \nthus not a priori distinguishable from international terrorism within one civilization. \n14 \nInstead, anti-Western terrorism is the consequence of the high strategic value of \nattacking Westerners. Islamic terror leaders may face additional incentives to attack \nWestern targets because of Western interference in countries of the Islamic civilization, \nwhose support is often crucial in preventing Islamic terror groups\u2019 bid for political \ninfluence.8 Western aid, arms, military assistance, military personnel as well as \neconomic and political support play a pivotal role in stabilizing the regimes in many \nMuslim countries like Egypt, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and, nowadays, Afghanistan and \nIraq, thus preventing Islamic terror leaders from reaching their goals. Terrorism targeted \nagainst the West as well as anyone co-operating with the West is supposed to provoke a \nmilitary Western response that fosters anti-Western sentiments amongst the broader \nMuslim population. With anti-Western sentiments evolving on a large scale, radical \nIslamists hope that the West will come under pressure and will eventually withdraw its \nsupport, which would fulfill the strategic objective of the Islamic terror group leaders. \nHuntington\u2019s paradigm also posits the existence of an important dynamic in inter-\ncivilizational clashes. He predicts that the end of the Cold War triggers off conflicts \nbetween different civilizations. Huntington sees the post-Cold War world as one in \nwhich different religions and cultures shape people\u2019s values and interests, leading to \ndominant conflicts of a new type: the clash of civilizations (Huntington 1996: 21). If he \nis right, then one would expect a structural break around the end of the Cold War, with \nincreases in inter-civilizational terrorism against Western targets, inter-civilizational \nterrorism perpetrated by Islamic groups and, particularly, Islamic terrorism against the \nWest. \nThe dynamics derived from our theory also differ from Huntington. In our theory, \nterrorist activity against victims of a specific nationality should go up if the strategic \nincentives for targeting these nationalities increase. This would be the case whenever \nthe foreign support becomes more pivotal for the home country of the terror leaders. \nWith respect to Islamic terrorism against Western targets, our theory suggests that \ndynamic changes in such terrorism do not depend on the prevalence of the Cold War as \nsuch, but on the strategic benefits Islamic terror leaders derive from targeting the West. \n15 \nThese benefits go up when the West increases its extent of interference in the Islamic \ncivilization. International events of the first half of this decade should have made the \nWest and the US in particular the single most important enemy of Islamic terror leaders. \nIn particular, the Western invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq after 9\/11 and the \nstabilization of embattled regimes in the Muslim world effectively serve as an obstacle \nto Islamic terror leaders, preventing them from reaching their goals. \nFurthermore, because political grievances help terror leaders in recruiting new \nfollowers, the continuing presence of Western troops on the soil of Muslim countries \nand the seeming ease with which the coalition troops overthrew the Taliban regime and \nthe government of Saddam Hussein are likely to have added to the feelings of power-\nlessness and humiliation among Muslim populations all around the world (Lewis 1990; \nTaarnby 2002; Fuller 2002; Richardson 2007; Riedel 2007). The US-led \u201cwar on terror\u201d \nmay or may not be successful in fighting the terror leaders; the odds are, however, that \nit renders recruiting Islamic terror followers easier still.9\n5. Research Design  \nIn the remainder of this article we will test the predictions of Huntington\u2019s paradigm as \nwell as of our strategic theory of international terrorism. Before we do so, however, we \ndiscuss the research design in some detail. \n5.1. Variables \nOur measures of terrorism are based on the \u201cInternational Terrorism: Attributes of \nTerrorist Events\u201d (Iterate) dataset (Mickolus et al. 2003). It includes as acts of terror \n\u201cthe use, or threat of use, of anxiety-inducing, extra-normal violence for political \npurposes by any individual or group, whether acting for or in opposition to established \ngovernmental authority, when such action is intended to influence the attitudes and \nbehaviour of a target group wider than the immediate victims\u201d (ibid.: 2). Terrorist \nviolence includes incidents as diverse as, among others, assassinations, bombings and \narmed attacks, arson and fire, kidnapping, and skyjacking, unless they are acts of \nordinary crime or the violence is for purposes other than political, e.g., for drug \ntrafficking. Violence committed during international and civil wars are not coded as \n16 \nterrorism. Consequently, guerrilla attacks by rebel groups are not counted either, unless \nthey are targeted against civilians or the dependents of military personnel (Mickolus, \nSandler and Murdock 1989: xii). Thus, Iterate excludes terror attacks against soldiers of \nthe coalition forces in Iraq, but includes kidnappings of foreign civil workers (Enders \nand Sandler 2006: 372). \nImportantly, Iterate excludes all terrorism that is purely domestic. To qualify as \ninternational, a terrorist act must \u201cthrough the nationality or foreign ties of its \nperpetrators, its location, the nature of its institutional or human victims, or the \nmechanics of its resolution, its ramifications transcend national boundaries\u201d (Mickolus \net al. 2003: 2). A terrorist act by groups fighting for independence (such as by the IRA) \nis counted as international if it takes place on the ruling country\u2019s own soil, but if it is \nexecuted on the territory under dispute, then it is generally regarded as domestic. The \nexclusion of purely domestic terrorism is not a problem for our analysis. Neither \nHuntington\u2019s clash of civilization\u2019s paradigm nor our own strategic theory of \ninternational terrorism make predictions about the extent of domestic terrorism. \nThe dataset compiles a wealth of information on each terrorist incident. Most \nimportantly for our purposes, it codes, where relevant, the three primary nationalities of \nterrorists and victims, as well as the number of people killed. Yet, Iterate is not without \nproblems. It does not list the exact number of fatalities belonging to each nationality. It \nis also dependent on mainly Western news reports and can therefore fail to capture \nincidents that did not make it into the news (Sandler and Enders 2004: 6). This could \nbias the results toward finding Westerners as the main victims of international terrorism \nand could thus bias our analysis toward finding evidence for excessive anti-Western \ninter-civilizational terrorism. Unfortunately, there is nothing one can do to correct this \npotential bias since there is no way of knowing how much terrorism against non-\nWesterners fails to make it into Western news media and therefore into Iterate. Despite \nthese and other shortcomings, Iterate represents by far the most detailed and complete \nexisting dataset on international terrorism. \n17 \nWe code from the dataset two dependent variables: the annual sum of terrorist \nincidents and the annual sum of the number of people killed, which serves as a measure \nof intensity. The nationality information allows us to create directed country dyadic de-\npendent variables. Thus, terrorism perpetrated by nationals of country x against \nnationals of country y are counted toward the x\u2192y dyad, whether it takes place on the \nterritory of country x, country y or some third country z. Using nationality information \nmeans that we lose terrorist acts for which Iterate does not provide information on the \nprimary nationality of terrorists or victims, but these are few in number. More \nimportantly, to be on the conservative side, we do not include the terrorism committed \nby \u201cIndeterminate Arabs, Palestine\u201d in the multivariate estimations. Our results are, \nhowever, robust to allocating each of these terror attacks to a randomly drawn Arab \ncountry. \nAn additional problem is that for the variable that measures the number of people \nkilled, in a small number of cases (less than two per cent), Iterate indicates that people \nwere killed, but states the number of people killed as unknown. Unfortunately, the 9\/11 \nterror attacks suffer from a combination of the two problems: 245 victims are stated \n(those on the planes), but for those killed on the ground, Iterate does not state a number, \nprobably because the 2992 people killed in total (including the terrorists), as listed in the \nofficial 9\/11 report (National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States \n2004: 552), is not an exact figure. Less clear is why Iterate attributes the attacks to the \ngroup of \u201cIndeterminate Arabs\u201d, when 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudi Arabian. We \ndiscuss below what effect the inclusion of the full death toll of 9\/11 and its allocation to \nSaudi Arabia as the origin country would have on the analysis of Islam versus West \nterrorism. \nTo avoid multiple counting, only the first nationality of the terrorists and the \nvictims determines the origin and the target country of a terrorist act. This has the \ndisadvantage that information on the second and third primary nationality of terrorists \nand victims is lost, but the vast majority of terrorist acts only involve one nationality of \n18 \nboth terrorists and victims.10 Our results are robust to attributing terrorist acts to all the \nfirst three main nationalities of terrorists and victims simultaneously. \nUsing nationality to determine the civilizational belonging of terrorists and victims \ncan be misleading. For example, if British-born Muslims kill primarily British citizens \n(as happened in the London attacks of July 2005), this would erroneously be coded as \nan intra-British and therefore intra-Western act of terrorism, whereas it is really an \nattack of Islamic terrorists on the West. Since this would bias the results against finding \nevidence for both Huntington\u2019s and our hypotheses, we are not too concerned about \nsuch measurement error. \nOur central explanatory variables are variables of foreign support for domestic \ngovernments, in line with our strategic theory, and inter-civilizational dummy variables \nto account for Huntington\u2019s predictions. A comprehensive test of our theory is \nhampered by the limited availability of data for a global sample on support rendered by \nthe government of one country to that of another country. For example, we know of no \ncomprehensive dataset of military aid by donors other than the United States. We \ninclude instead a measure of general economic aid, with data taken from OECD (2007). \nIn addition, we have data on arms transfers from the major weapons exporters, both \nWestern and non-Western, from SIPRI (2007), data on foreign intervention in domestic \ncivil wars from Gleditsch et al. (2002) as well as data on military alliances between \ncountries from Leeds (2005) and Sprecher and Krause (2006).11 Foreign aid is \nmeasured relative to gross domestic product of the receiving country (World Bank \n2006), whereas arms transfers are set in relation to domestic military expenditures \n(Correlates of War 2007 and World Bank 2006). In both cases, the idea is to measure \nforeign support relative to domestic capacity. For foreign intervention in civil wars, no \ndata exist on the extent of foreign intervention. Instead, the variable accounts for the 3-\nscale ordinal intensity of the armed conflict itself (below 25 annual battle deaths; above \n25, but below 1000; above 1000). Military alliance is a dummy variable that indicates \nwhether two countries had entered into a formal alliance in the form of a defense pact \nwith each other. There is the possibility that more support is rendered to countries from \n19 \nwhich more terrorism against nationals of the supporting country\u2019s government (reverse \ncausality). We mitigate this potential problem by lagging the foreign support variables \nby one year.12\nIn order to test Huntington\u2019s predictions we use three dummy variables for specific \ninter-civilizational pairs: rest v west for dyads in which the origin country is non-\nWestern whereas the target country is Western, islam v rest for dyads in which the \norigin country belongs to the Islamic civilization whereas the target country does not \nand islam v west for dyads in which the origin country belongs to the Islamic and the \ntarget country to the Western civilization. Huntington is neither perfectly clear nor \nconsistent on which country belongs to which civilization. We follow here Russett, \nOneal and Cox\u2019s (2000) classification, but we stress that our results are robust to relying \non Henderson and Tucker\u2019s (2001) interpretation of Huntington instead. We exclude \nterror attacks involving Israeli terrorists or Israeli victims from all estimations. This is \nbecause we do not want to artificially inflate our estimates of Islamic terrorism against \nthe West by including this very peculiar conflict. Results are robust to including Israel \nin the estimations, either as a Western state as in Russet, Oneal and Cox (2000) or into \nthe residual category of \u201cother\u201d states as in Henderson and Tucker (2001). \nThe inclusion of control variables is of great importance, because economic, \npolitical and geographical factors that are correlated with our foreign political support or \nwith the civilizational dummy variables could determine international terrorism. Failure \nto include them would potentially lead to biased results. For example, some economists \nsuggest that international terrorism is directed at wealthier Western countries (Abadie \n2006: 50). Autocracies supposedly produce more terrorism (Krueger and Laitin 2003: 4; \nLi 2005), whereas democracies are extremely vulnerable as terrorist targets (Pape 2003; \nEnders and Sandler 2006). Size also matters: More populous countries will, ceteris \nparibus, generate more terrorism and suffer more from terrorism. Contiguous and \ngeographically close countries should experience more terrorism. We control for all \nthese factors \u2013 see the appendix for variable definitions and data sources. Our results are \nrobust to the inclusion of additional control variables such as bilateral trade, as well as \n20 \nthe presence or intensity of armed conflict between countries or within the origin or tar-\nget country. We can also remove intra-civilizational dyads from the sample or control \nfor intra-civilizational terrorism via a dummy variable and the results still hold. \n5.2. Estimation Methods \nWe are only interested in international terrorism, not in domestic terrorism, since neither \nHuntington nor our strategic theory make predictions about domestic terrorism. In our \ndataset, there are many incidents where the main nationality of the terrorists and the \nvictims are the same. These cases do not constitute purely domestic terrorism since \nsome other aspect of the incident or its resolution might transcend national boundaries. \nOtherwise they would not be included in Iterate. However, these are cases in which the \ndistinction between international and domestic terrorism is often blurred. In other \nwords, the Iterate data are noisy and there is some measurement error in what counts as \ninternational and domestic terrorism. One can employ three strategies for dealing with \nsuch error. First, the \u201cdo nothing\u201d option simply ignores the error. Second, one can try \nto control for the measurement error. This is the strategy we have chosen in the reported \nestimates by including a dummy variable for identical dyads (i.e., where the main \nnationality of the terrorists and the victims are the same). In comparison to the first \nstrategy, the efficiency of the estimates is likely to increase and any potential bias is \nlikely to decline, but it does not necessarily disappear. Third, one can remove identical \ndyads from the analysis. This option may reduce the efficiency of the estimate, but \npossibly also the bias. While we report only the results from the second strategy, we \nhave conducted all three types of analyses and found no substantial differences in the \nparameters of interest. Our results are therefore robust and this apparent source of bias \ndoes not seem to matter much. \nOur dependent variables are count variables, which is why we use a negative \nbinomial regression model with standard errors adjusted for clustering on civilizational \ndyads. Terrorism data are over-dispersed, so that the poisson model not only suffers \nfrom heteroskedasticity but also (and more importantly) from deflated standard errors \n(see Cameron and Trivedi 2005, ch. 20). The negative binomial model we use here \n21 \naccounts for over-dispersion by augmenting the Poisson distribution by a Gamma \ndistribution. Unless the distribution is grossly mis-specified, the negative binomial \nmodel gives more reliable estimates. Our sample covers the period 1969 to 2005 and up \nto 148 countries. Depending on data availability on the explanatory variables not all \npossible country dyads are included over the entire period. \n \n6.  Testing the Clash of Civilizations Against the Strategic Logic of \nInternational Terrorism \nWe conduct three types of analyses. First, we present simple frequency tables of \ninternational terrorism within and across civilizations. In the second set of analyses we \nreport results from multivariate regressions, estimating one parameter for the variables \nof interest to test the static version of our hypotheses. However, since Huntington\u2019s \nparadigm predicts a structural break in the coefficients of the inter-civilizational dummy \nvariables, we also, thirdly, re-estimate these models allowing these coefficients to differ \nduring and after the Cold War period. \n6.1. The Static Perspective \nTables 2 and 3 present frequency tables of terrorist incidents and killings within and \nacross civilizations. Despite the simplicity of such tables, the reported frequencies \nreveal an interesting pattern. The tables indicate that Westerners are the main target of \ninternational terrorism in general as well as of Islamic terrorists in particular. They also \nlend some provisional support to the hypothesis that the Islamic civilization is the most \nviolent one in terms of international terrorism. \n \nTables 2 and 3 about here \n \nYet, frequency tables cannot control for other structural factors that may actually cause \nterrorism. We therefore now turn to multivariate analysis, for which table 4 presents \nnegative binomial regression results: \n22 \n \nTable 4 about here \n \nWe briefly discuss the results for the control variables before coming to our main \nresults. We find that population sizes of both the origin and the target countries increase \nthe number of incidents and killings. Significantly more terrorism is targeted against \nnationals of the same country than against those of other countries. Distance between \nterrorist and target country reduces terrorism. Contiguity is a weakly significantly \npositive factor for incidents, but insignificant for the number of people killed. Like \nothers before us (e.g., Cornes and Sandler 2006), we find that terrorism increases in the \nwealth of the targeted country relative to the origin country. Moreover, our results show \nthat combinations of political regime type do not differ systematically in their \npropensity to terrorism relative to the base category, the democratic origin\u2013autocratic \ntarget dyad. Autocratic dyads seem to have fewer incidents, but not killings. Altogether, \nregime type does not seem to matter all that much.13  \nAs concerns our variables of main interest, we find clear support for our strategic \ntheory of international terrorism. More terrorist incidents and killings emanate from \ncountries, which depend more on foreign economic aid and on arms imports against \ncitizens of the foreign country sending aid and arms. More terrorism also is directed \nagainst foreigners from countries that have entered into a military alliance with the \nterrorists\u2019 home country and that intervene in civil conflicts in the terrorists\u2019 home \ncountry on the side of the government. \nTurning to the inter-civilizational dummy variables, we find no significant effect \nwith respect to terrorism from the Islamic civilization against nationals of all other \ncivilizations in general. In other words, the Islamic civilization is not per se sig-\nnificantly more drawn to inter-civilizational terrorism if we control for the geographical \nand socio-political determinants of terrorist activity. However, we find significantly \npositive results for terrorism from other civilizations against the West and for Islamic \n23 \nterrorism against the West, as predicted by Huntington. As explained previously, such a \nresult is, however, not necessarily inconsistent with our theory. \n6.2. Inter-civilizational Terrorism During and After the End of the Cold War \nHuntington predicts that the end of the Cold War triggers off conflicts between different \ncivilizations. If he is right, then one would expect a structural break around the end of \nthe Cold War with an increase in anti-Western terrorism from other civilizations, \nterrorism perpetrated by Islamic groups against other civilizations, and, particularly, \nIslamic terrorism against the West. Our theory does not predict any such structural \nbreaks for general Islamic or general anti-Western terrorist activities. For Islamic \nterrorism against the West, the strategic logic of international terrorism suggests that \nthis type of terrorism is spurred by active Western military involvement for the \nstabilization of embattled regimes in the Muslim world. \nPrevious studies of Huntington\u2019s paradigm have typically been hampered by the \nfact that they could not or did not cover the post-Cold War period (Russett, Oneal and \nCox 2000; Henderson and Tucker 2001; Henderson 2004). This has allowed Huntington \n(2000: 609) to simply dismiss such studies as \u2018temporally irrelevant\u2019. Where studies \nhave covered the post-Cold War period, they have typically tested Huntington\u2019s \npredictions for variation over time by a Chow test (Chiozza 2002; Bolks and Stoll 2003; \nGartzke and Gleditsch 2006). We interact the inter-civilizational dummy variable of \ninterest with a Cold War and a post-Cold War dummy variable. Both of these interacted \nterms enter the estimations and the Chow test functions via testing the hypothesis that \nthe coefficients of the two interacted terms are equal to each other.14\nIn table 5 we report Chow-test results. Note that all the other explanatory variables \nwere of course included in the estimations, but because their coefficients are practically \nidentical to the ones shown in table 4 and to save space, we only report coefficients of \nthe interaction terms between the relevant inter-civilizational dummy variables on the \none hand and dummy variables for the Cold War and post-Cold War period on the other \nhand together with tests of coefficient equality.15\n \n24 \nTable 5 about here \n \nStarting with the clash between Islam and the remaining civilizations, the islam v rest \ndummy variables are statistically insignificant both in the Cold War and in the post-\nCold War period for terrorist incidents, whereas for terrorist killings the variable is \nnegative and significant in the Cold War period and insignificant in the post-Cold War \nperiod. The Wald tests fail to reject the hypotheses of equal coefficients for terrorist \nincidents, but not for terrorist killings. However, this is no evidence for Huntington \nbecause Islamic terrorists turn from generating below average inter-civilizational \nterrorism to merely average. \nBoth of the islam v west dummy variables are statistically significant with the \nexpected positive sign for terrorist incidents. However, the Wald test fails to reject the \nhypothesis of equal coefficients and, moreover, the dummy has a smaller coefficient \nduring the post-Cold War period than before. As regards terrorist killings, the dyad \nbetween Islam and the West turns from one that generates significantly below average \nkillings during the Cold War period to one with significantly above average killings.16 \nNot surprisingly, the test of equality of coefficients suggests much higher terrorist \nactivity in the post-Cold War period. The result for islam v west on terrorist killings, but \nnot on incidents, can thus be interpreted as evidence for Huntington. \nFinally, while the rest v west dummy variables are statistically significantly positive \nin both periods for both incidents and killings, the Wald tests fail to reject the \nhypotheses of equal coefficients. For incidents, for which the test is close to statistical \nsignificance, the rest v west dummy variable is, contrary to predictions based on \nHuntington, higher rather than lower in the Cold War period. In sum, there is no \nevidence for Huntington\u2019s dynamic predictions with the exception of the clash between \nIslam and the West and even then only for terrorist killings as the dependent variable.  \nWe now take a more detailed look at this particular case. To do so we have re-\nestimated model 6 of table 4 in \u201cfour-year moving average sub-period\u201d models: we \nbegin with a sample that covers only the years from 1969 to 1971, then include only the \n25 \nyears from 1970 to 1973, and so on and finally estimate the years from 2002 to 2005. \nThis gives 34 coefficients for each included variable. These coefficients describe the \ninfluence of a regressor on the dependent variable over time. The change in a parameter \nfrom one estimate to the next estimate captures the parameter difference between the \nfirst year from the first estimate and the last year from the next estimate.  \nIn order to explore the dynamics of Islam versus West terrorism, we regress the \nestimated islam v west coefficients from the moving average sub-period models on their \nlagged values, a general time trend and a post-Cold War dummy variable. To these we \nadd, in separate estimations, two operationalizations of the time period of the \nAfghanistan and Iraq wars: The first operationalization is a simple dummy variable \ncoded 1 for the years 2002 onwards, and the second \u2018counts\u2019 the wars so that it is coded \n1 in 2002 and 2 from 2003 onwards. Table 6 reports the results. The post-Cold War \ndummy is insignificant throughout. This would suggest that the end of the Cold War as \nsuch does not matter to Islamic terrorism targeted against the West. The invasions of \nIraq and Afghanistan and the subsequent stabilization of pro-Western regimes seem to \nspur Islamic anti-Western terrorism, however, as both the dummy war variable (column \n2) and the categorical war variable are statistically significantly positive (column 3). \n \nTable 6 about here \n \nThese dynamics of terrorism in the Islam-West dyad do not necessarily falsify \nHuntington\u2019s paradigm. After all, one can regard the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as \nconventional military Huntington-type clashes between the West and Islam, to which \nthe Islamic civilization responds with increasingly lethal terrorism (but not more \nterrorist incidents). However, the evidence fits better our strategic logic of international \nterrorism, which stresses the role that active Western military involvement in the \nIslamic civilization for the stabilization of embattled governments plays in promoting \nIslamic terrorism against Western targets. \n26 \n7. Conclusion \nThe results reported in this article provide supportive evidence for our strategic theory \nof international terrorism: if foreign countries support the government of the terrorists\u2019 \nhome country with economic aid, arms transfers, military alliances and intervention in \ncivil wars, then domestic terror leaders have a strategic incentive to attack nationals \nfrom that foreign country. This is exactly what we find in our estimations of \ninternational terrorism in a directed country dyad sample over the period 1969 to 2005. \nThese patterns of international terrorism are predicted by our strategic theory and are \nsimply incompatible with a non-strategic account of international terrorism such as \nHuntington\u2019s paradigm of a clash of civilizations. \nOur results also provide limited supportive evidence for some of the claims con-\ntained in Huntington\u2019s paradigm, however. In line with Huntington, we conclude that \nthere is excessive terrorism from non-Western and from Islamic countries on Western \ntargets. This result is not necessarily inconsistent with our theory since terror leaders \nderive strategic benefits from attacking Western targets, for which our variables of \nstrategic interest cannot fully account. More importantly, our analysis does not fully \nsupport Huntington\u2019s predictions. The Islam versus Rest dummy variable is not \nstatistically significantly different from zero. The characterization of Islam drawn in \nHuntington\u2019s work is thus exaggerated, at least with respect to international terrorism. \nThe dynamic perspective is also significantly at odds with Huntington. Most im-\nportantly, we do not find evidence for a simple structural break in the post-Cold War \nperiod. Terrorism originating from non-Western civilizations against Western targets \nand inter-civilizational terrorism originating from the Islamic civilization do not \nsystematically increase after the end of the Cold War. The dynamics of Islamic \nterrorism against the West reveal an upward trend in the 1990s, but only for terrorist \nkillings, not for incidents. Furthermore, this trend is also consistent with a strategic \nlogic of international terrorism, which would suggest that Islamic terror on Western \ntargets goes up when the West becomes more actively militarily involved in the Islamic \ncivilization as part of the US-led \u201cwar on terror\u201d. \n27 \nWhat does our analysis tell us about the likely future of international terrorism? If \nHuntington is right, then we will see more of anti-Western inter-civilizational terrorism, \nmore of Islamic terrorism against other civilizations and, particularly, a further rise in \nIslamic terrorism against Western targets. The implications from our own theory of \nterrorism do not suggest any such upward trend. With respect to Islamic terror on \nWestern targets, Western countries are in a no-win situation. If they retreat from the \nMuslim world, this will be celebrated as a victory by the terror leaders and a toppling of \npro-Western regimes dependent on Western support might follow. However, with con-\ntinuing Western military intervention in the Muslim world, Islamic terror leaders will \nmaintain and possibly increase their attacks on Western targets. Unless the \u201cwar on \nterror\u201d leads to the military defeat and destruction of terror groups, which seems \nunlikely based on what we have seen since 9\/11, then it is likely to increase, rather than \ndecrease, Islamic terrorism against the West. Not only does the \u201cwar on terror\u201d raise the \nstrategic benefits of perpetrating terrorist acts on Western targets, but, in addition, every \nMuslim hurt or killed in this war may facilitate the recruitment of new followers by \nIslamic terror leaders. \n28 \nNotes \n \n \n1  See Russett, Oneal and Cox 2000; Henderson and Tucker 2001; Chiozza 2002; Bolks and \nStoll 2003; Henderson 2004, 2005; Ellingsen, 2005; Fox 2005; Gartzke and Gleditsch \n2006. \n2  No other single statement in his 1993 article attracted more criticism than this one \n(Huntington 1996: 258). \n3  We call them terror entrepreneurs and terror agents in Neumayer and Pl\u00fcmper (2007) and \nPl\u00fcmper and Neumayer (2007). \n4  This is not to say that all members of one terrorist organization have identical \npreferences. Rather, terror groups typically consist of \u201cheterogeneous cells, factions, and \nindividuals\u201d (Bueno de Mesquita 2005b: 146).  \n5  Kydd and Walter (2006: 52) mention five goals: regime change, territorial change, policy \nchange, social control, and status quo maintenance. We summarize these goals under the \nterm political change. \n6  Four if one includes the anarchist wave dominating the period before the First World \nWar. \n7  This is consistent with Torres et al.\u2019s (2006) analysis of the propaganda from extremist \nIslamic movements. They find that almost all of it is in Arabic and addressed at Muslims. \n8  The military strength of the West also implies a power asymmetry that renders terror \ntactically opportune. This becomes nowhere clearer than in Al Qaeda\u2019s 1996 \u201cDeclaration \nof War on America\u201d: \u201c[I]t must be obvious to you that, due to the imbalance of power \nbetween our armed forces and the enemy forces, a suitable means of fighting must be \nadopted. (\u2026) And as you know, it is wise, in the present circumstances, for the armed \nmilitary forces not to be engaged in a conventional fighting with the forces of the \ncrusader enemy.\u201d (Al Qaeda 2006: 283). \n9  The 2004 Strategic Survey of the International Institute for Strategic Studies came to the \nsobering conclusion that the American presence in Iraq \u201cprovided a potent global \nrecruitment pretext for al-Qaeda, had galvanized the transnational Islamic terrorist \nmovement and probably increased terrorist activity worldwide\u201d (IISS 2004: 169). \nSimilarly, Pape (2005: 103) finds that \u2018the presence of American military forces for \ncombat operations on the homeland territory of the suicide terrorists is stronger than \n29 \n \nIslamic fundamentalism in predicting whether individuals from that country will become \nal-Qaeda suicide terrorists\u2019. \n10  About 3 and 22 per cent of terror attacks involve terrorists and victims with more than \none nationality, respectively. \n11  We extend the 2003 value of this variable to the year 2004. Military alliances are very \npersistent over time, which should minimize any bias this may introduce into the \nestimations. The results are fully robust to constraining the estimations to the period 1969 \nto 2004. \n12  It seems impossible to us to find valid instruments, which means that we cannot use this \ntheoretically superior alternative. \n13  This result seems to be at odds with the findings of Li (2005), who reports that more \nterrorist attacks occur in countries with lower levels of political participation. One has to \nkeep in mind, however, that his and our results are hardly comparable since we are \nanalyzing directed dyads and Li a monadic dataset. \n14  A Chow-test can be problematic because it can find spurious evidence for a structural \nbreak if there is a general upward-sloping trend in the dependent variable. Alternative \ntests are available from the authors on request. \n15  We let the post-Cold War period start in 1990, but results are very similar for letting it \nstart in 1989 or 1991 instead. \n16  Note that this is true despite the fact that the full death toll of 9\/11 is not included in the \ndependent variable, as pointed out in section 5.1. \n30 \nReferences \nAbadie, Alberto. 2006. \u201cPoverty, Political Freedom, and the Roots of Terrorism.\u201d \nAmerican Economic Review 96 (2): 50-56. \nAhmed, Akbar and Brian Forst (eds). 2005.
