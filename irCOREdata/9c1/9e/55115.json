A physically-based technique for interpolating ex-\nternal magnetic field disturbances across large spatial areas\ncan be achieved with the Spherical Elementary Current Sys-\ntem (SECS) method using data from ground-based magnetic\nobservatories. The SECS method represents complex elec-\ntrical current systems as a simple set of equivalent currents\nplaced at a specific height in the ionosphere. The magnetic\nfield recorded at observatories can be used to invert for the\nelectrical currents, which can subsequently be employed to\ninterpolate or extrapolate the magnetic field across a large\narea.

We investigate the application of the SECS\nmethod at mid- to high geomagnetic latitudes using a series\nof observatory networks to test the performance of the exter-\nnal field interpolation over large distances.

The primary sources include (1) the main field gen-\nerated in the outer core, (2) the crustal field and (3) fields\nproduced by solar-terrestrial interaction. Electrical currents\nCorrespondence to: C. D. Beggan\n(ciar@bgs.ac.uk)\ninduced in the subsurface are a secondary source contribu-\ntion to the measured magnetic field, but can be significant.\nAny surface measurement is a summation of these different\nfields at each instant of time. On time periods of seconds to\ndays, changes in the magnetic field are principally of exter-\nnal origin and are caused by the solar wind, magnetosphere\nand ionosphere\/upper atmosphere interaction (e.g. Campbell,\n2003).\nThe study of temporal changes in the geomagnetic field\nand the accompanying induced electric fields are of inter-\nest in Earth hazard research. There are two classes of tech-\nnology that are adversely impacted by space weather: those\ndirectly affected by variations in the geomagnetic field and\nthose affected by the electric currents induced by the chang-\ning field. Modern applications of space weather studies to\nground-based technology consider the problems of geomag-\nnetically induced currents within power grids, oil and gas\npipelines, telecommunication cables and railway equipment\n(Boteler et al., 1998; Pirjola et al., 2000; Pirjola, 2005). In-\ndirectly, geomagnetic disturbances in the ionosphere\/upper\natmosphere can disrupt the operation of technology exploit-\ning real-time satellite data, such as positioning and naviga-\ntion systems (e.g. Klobuchar, 1986). Estimates of external\nmagnetic field values are often required at locations where it\nmay not be possible or practical to make accurate measure-\nments. For example, hydrocarbon exploration and produc-\ntion often demands real-time geomagnetic reference data at\noffshore oilfields around the UK and at other high latitude re-\ngions (Reay et al., 2005). Using real-time external field data\naids accuracy in positional control of directional boreholes\nfor safer extraction of oil and gas in challenging reservoirs\n(Bowe and McCulloch, 2007).\nThe surface effects of the external magnetic field can be\nmodelled in terms of ionospheric equivalent currents. Com-\nplex 3-D currents systems may be represented as simple\nspherical sheets of current which mimic the magnetic effects\nof the ionosphere (Vanhama\u00a8ki et al., 2003). Telluric currents\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n1796 S. A. McLay and C. D. Beggan: External magnetic field interpolation using SECS\ninduced in the subsurface can also produce significant mag-\nnetic field disturbances. During sub-storm onset their contri-\nbution can be up to 40% of the total observed change (Tan-\nskanen et al., 2001). The magnetic effects of telluric currents\ncan also be modelled as equivalent currents. These can be\nconstructed to lie within the subsurface and the superposi-\ntion of their magnetic effect with the ionospheric contribu-\ntion can be used to calculate the total ground magnetic field\ndisturbance.\nSeveral techniques have been developed to calculate\nequivalent currents from ground-based measurements; two\nof the most successful thus far have been the Fourier method\n(Mersmann et al., 1979) and Spherical Cap Harmonic Anal-\nysis (SCHA) (Haines, 1985). The Fourier method assumes\nplanarity of the Earth\u2019s surface which limits its spatial ap-\nplicability, while the SCHA method employs global wave-\nlength cut-offs and consequently is prone to aliasing effects,\nparticularly with noisy data. A third approach, the Spheri-\ncal Elementary Current System (SECS) method, was estab-\nlished and developed by Amm (1997) and Amm and Vilja-\nnen (1999) respectively. The use of SECS overcomes some\nof the limitations of the other two methods and is suitable\nfor studies both on a local and global scale. Amm and Vilja-\nnen (1999) demonstrated that the SECS technique produced\na better fit than SCHA to simulated ionosphere conditions,\nwhile Pulkkinen et al. (2003b) showed it to be applicable for\nthe interpolation of ionospheric fields in a densely sampled,\nrelatively small region of northern Scandinavia.\nIn this paper we use the SECS method to interpolate exter-\nnal magnetic field disturbances over large spatial areas using\nrelatively few input observatories. We test the method with\ndata from networks of magnetometers in North America,\naround the North Sea and in Central Europe. The ability to\nmodel large and complex current variations in the ionosphere\nis investigated, as well as the adaptability to different spatial\nnetwork configurations and scales. In Sect. 2 we briefly cover\nthe theory of SECS and the computational framework for the\ninterpolation of magnetic field disturbances. In Sect. 3 we\ndescribe the data used in the study and in Sect. 4 we illus-\ntrate the resulting interpolation from the SECS method by\ncomparison to measured observatory data. We discuss the\napplications and limitations of the technique in Sect. 5.\n2 Spherical Elementary Current Systems\nIonospheric currents form a complex 3-D system, compris-\ning three distinct current flows: Hall, Pedersen and field-\naligned currents (FACs) (Ritter et al., 2004). By assum-\ning sets of uniform conductance within the ionosphere and\nby using Ampere\u2019s law, Fukushima (1976) first showed that\nmagnetic perturbations produced by Pederson currents and\nFACs cancel each other below the base of the ionosphere.\nAs the curl-free part of the current system Jcf is associated\nwith FACs it will produce no magnetic effect below the de-\nfined base of the ionosphere. (Note, this property is actu-\nally valid independently of how the currents are produced,\ni.e. it does not depend on the type of current flowing in the\nionosphere or whether the conductances are uniform or not.)\nThe curl-free system and therefore measurements at the sur-\nface of the Earth can neglect these effects. As a result of this\nsimplification, ground magnetic field disturbances can be ob-\ntained from an exclusively divergence-free system of equiva-\nlent currents at a specific height in the ionosphere. A similar\napproach can be taken in the subsurface, by placing the ele-\nmentary current systems at an appropriate depth. It is impor-\ntant to remember that ionospheric equivalent currents are not\na true representation of the 3-D current systems in the iono-\nsphere or in the subsurface, but are 2-D current sheets that\nproduce a similar magnetic effect.\n2.1 Background\nThe basic concept of SECS is to construct the equivalent cur-\nrent system using a linear superposition of divergence-free\nelementary current systems, all of which can be placed freely\nwithin the current plane. Amm (1997) defined a divergence-\nfree system of spherical elementary sheet currents, Jdf, us-\ning a spherical coordinate system (r,\u03b8,\u03c6) with unit vectors\n(er ,e\u03b8 ,e\u03c6) such that the poles of the elementary systems are\nat their centres. With this description current sheets can be\ndefined for the ionosphere and the subsurface:\nJextdf (r,\u03b8) =\nI e\n4piRS\ncot\n(\n\u03b8\n2\n)\ne\u03c6 (1)\nJintdf (r,\u03b8) =\nI i\n4piRG\ncot\n(\n\u03b8\n2\n)\ne\u03c6 (2)\nIn this description I e and I i are the scaling factors for both\nexternal and internal divergence-free current systems and RS\nand RG are the radius of the ionosphere and the depth of in-\nductance in the ground, respectively. These radii are defined\nin this study as infinitely thin layers 110 km above the Earth\u2019s\nsurface and 100 km beneath the Earth\u2019s surface. By apply-\ning Helmholtz\u2019s theorem to Eqs. (1) and (2), Amm (1997)\ndemonstrated that any ionospheric current distribution may\nbe constructed uniquely by placing the poles of elementary\nsystems within a plane.\nThe method developed in Amm and Viljanen (1999) in-\ntroduced the continuation of the magnetic field disturbance\nfrom the ground to the ionosphere using SECS placement.\nPulkkinen et al. (2003a) extended the complex image method\nof Pirjola and Viljanen (1998) to show that the field could be\ncalculated from superposition of the magnetic effect of two\nhorizontal current layers composed of divergence-free ele-\nmentary current systems. Their derivation is constructed for\na point at radius r between the current system in the ground\nand in the ionosphere, RG < r <RS for a position (\u03b8,\u03c6) on\nthe Earth. The magnetic field vector (B) at the surface of the\nEarth is then expressed by the superposition of the magnetic\nAnn. Geophys., 28, 1795\u20131805, 2010 www.ann-geophys.net\/28\/1795\/2010\/\nS. A.

L and\nM , with subscripts j and k, denote the number of current\nsystems solved for within the ground and at the radius of\nthe ionosphere, respectively. Formulation of the magnetic\nfield superposition is given in Appendix A of Pulkkinen et al.\n(2003a).\n2.2 Inversion for current system scalings\nWe assume that the magnetic field vector B has been mea-\nsured at a set of points and construct a linear system of equa-\ntions relating the measured field to the geometric parts and\nscaling factors of both the internal and external elementary\ncurrent systems. Expressing this in matrix form gives:\nB=T \u00b7I (4)\nWe look to solve the linear inverse problem to determine the\nscaling factors I of the internal and external elementary cur-\nrent systems. Due to the (generally) limited number of fixed\nground magnetic observatories, the number of observation\npoints is usually much lower than the number of elementary\ncurrent systems required to produce a good representation of\nthe actual currents. The linear inverse problem is therefore\nhighly underdetermined:\nI=T\u22121 \u00b7B (5)\nThe matrix T may be badly conditioned which produces nu-\nmerical instabilities when attempting to invert Eq. (5) di-\nrectly. Thus, we employ Singular Value Decomposition\n(SVD) for the inversion, truncating such that any eigenval-\nues with an absolute value less than 1\/100th of the largest are\nexcluded from the solution, as suggested in Pulkkinen et al.\n(2003b). The truncation stabilises the inversion and tends to\nproduce a slight smoothing effect on the solution. Other trun-\ncation levels were tested, including the truncation of eigen-\nvalues with an absolute value less than 1\/10th of the largest\nvalue and also no truncation. The results were stable and in-\ndeed quite similar; suggesting in these experiments that the\nT matrix is not actually badly conditioned.\nWe solve for the scaling factors of the currents systems\non a rectangular grid evenly-spaced in latitude and longitude\n(note, any reasonable shape and spacing could be used). The\nforward solution for the magnetic field (B) on the Earth\u2019s\nsurface at any position within the grid can be calculated by\ndetermining the T matrix for the point of interest and using\nthe scaling factors from the inversion.\nModelling was undertaken using minute mean magnetic\nfield vector values. To prepare the data for inversion, the\ninternal and crustal fields for each day were removed by sub-\ntracting the mean daily baseline values from the X, Y and Z\ncomponents, giving a 24-h set of magnetic disturbance val-\nues about the average. This deviation from the mean was\nused as the input into the B matrix and the positions of the\nobservatories were used to construct the T matrix. The scal-\ning factors (I) for the current systems across the grid of points\nwere solved for every minute of the day.\nThe accuracy of the interpolation method is quantified by\ncomparing the estimated magnetic field to data measured at\nan observatory which has not been used in the inversion. The\nroot-mean-square (RMS) error (or misfit) between the esti-\nmated magnetic field and the measured field at time t can be\ncalculated as:\nRMS=\n\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a 1\nN\nN\u2211\nt\n(\nB tobs\u2212B tSECS\n)2 (6)\nwhere the subscript \u201cobs\u201d indicates the measured field at an\nobservatory and \u201cSECS\u201d is the estimated field, for each of the\nthree components of the magnetic field vector. The power\nof the measured data is described by the root-mean-square\nof the values, giving a coarse estimate of how magnetically\ndisturbed the day was:\nPower=\n\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a 1\nN\nN\u2211\nt\n(\nB tObs\n)2\n. (7)\n3 Investigation of controlling factors\nWe wish to investigate how well the SECS method can inter-\npolate the magnetic field across a region. It is assumed that\nthe goodness of fit of the interpolation depends on several\nfactors, including region size, the number of input observa-\ntories, and the relative spacing and location of the observato-\nries. We also investigate the effect of relatively magnetically\ndisturbed versus relatively quiet days, particularly in terms\nof the magnitude of the changes due to the external field and\nwhether there are obvious differences e.g. due to the longi-\ntude offset of the observatories or perhaps induced currents.\nWe constructed five networks of magnetic observatories at\nmid- to high geomagnetic latitudes, with the number of in-\nput observatories varying from five to eight. Networks 1, 2\nand 3 use eight, five and seven observatories, respectively,\nlocated at high geomagnetic latitude within the auroral zone\nin North America (\u2248 60\u25e6\u201372\u25e6 N).

The variometer data used in\nNetwork 4 were acquired from the UK Sub-Auroral Magne-\ntometer Network (SAMNET) data repository.\nIn addition, we tested two alternative implementations of\nthe SECS equation. We solved solely for the external current\nelementary system scale value (I e), thus excluding the inter-\nnal current systems (I i). The external-only SECS (second\nterm of Eq. 3) requires a solution for only half the number\nof parameters, and produces a different set of scaling factors\ncompared to the solution using both the external and inter-\nnal elementary current systems. We also solved for the X\nand Y components of the external field to test if the solution\nimproved when the Z component was ignored.\nA further interpolation method was also used as a compar-\nison to the interpolation of the SECS method. We employed\nthe latitudinal-weighted average of measurements from two\nobservatories, one to the south and one to the north of the\ntest observatory. In some networks, the two other observa-\ntories were not sited at a similar longitude to the test obser-\nvatory, leading to interpolation errors due to differences in\nlocal time, for example. Hence, the resulting error in the in-\nterpolation is strongly dependent on the relative positions of\nthe two observatories, in both latitude and longitude.\n4 Results\nWe examined how well the SECS method performed with\ntwo separate experiments. Firstly, a magnetically disturbed\nday and a magnetically quiet day were chosen for detailed\nstudy and the estimate from SECS, SECS (External only) and\nlatitudinal weighting were compared to data from an obser-\nvatory. Secondly, three months of data were used to examine\nhow well the three methods compared on average to the as-\nsumption that the external field did not change (i.e. predicting\nzero disturbance throughout the day).\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/28\/1795\/2010\/ Ann.

Due to the\navailability of data for Networks 4 and 5, different days were\nselected: a magnetically disturbed day (11 September 2005)\nwith Kp of up to 7- and a magnetically quiet day (21 Septem-\nber 2005) with a Kp of 1+ were used instead. The results on\nthe magnetically disturbed days for Network 1 and Network\n4 are given in Figs. 2 and 3.\nFigure 2 shows the comparison of the measured data at\nthe Iqaluit (IQA) observatory (green solid, dots) and the es-\ntimate of the magnetic field from the SECS method using\ninternal and external current systems (black solid) for Net-\nwork 1. The estimate from interpolation using latitudinal\nweighting (blue dashed) of data from Qeqertarsuaq (GDH)\nand Narsarsuaq (NAQ) are also shown. Note both of these\nobservatories are approximately 1000 km east of IQA. The\nSECS (External only) estimate solving only for an external\nset of current systems (grey dot-dash) is also plotted. The es-\ntimate from inverting the SECS equation with only the X and\nY components was almost identical to the result for the SECS\nmethod using internal and external current systems and so is\nnot plotted to avoid cluttering the figures.\nDeviations of over 300 nT in each component were\nrecorded during the course of the day. The SECS estima-\ntion for the X, Y and Z components of the magnetic field\nare relatively close to the measured data and are a better fit\nthan the estimate from the latitudinal weighting in each of the\ncomponents. However, the magnitude of large disturbances\nare sometimes underestimated (e.g. between minutes 50 and\n250, in all components) and the method does not manage to\nreproduce sharp spikes seen in the ground disturbance; rather\nthe SECS estimate smoothes the variations in this part. An\noverestimation of the magnetic disturbance is also observed\nbetween minutes 425 and 650, particularly in the Z compo-\nnent. The SECS estimate manages to capture the gross fea-\ntures of the data throughout the course of the day. In the X\nand Y components, the SECS (External only) estimate com-\npares very well with the SECS estimate but is extremely poor\nin the Z component.\nAnn.

For example, the power of the data (Eq. 7)\nin the Y component is 62.8 nT, while the RMS misfit of the\nSECS and the SECS (X and Y only) estimate is 40.2 nT and\nthe SECS (External only) estimate is 44.4 nT. The misfit of\nthe latitudinal weighted estimate is 67.6 nT, indicating that\nthe variance of the latitudinal weighted estimate is worse than\nthat of the data. If one had assumed no change occurred in\nthe field due to the external field throughout the day for this\ncomponent, it would have been (slightly) better than using\nthe latitudinal weighted estimate. Thus, in the Y component\nthe SECS method shows a strong improvement on the latitu-\ndinal weighting method, though the advantage gained from\nthe SECS method is not as great in the X and Z components.\nIn Network 4 (North Sea region), external field varia-\ntions recorded at Eskdalemuir (ESK) observatory during the\nmagnetically active day exceeded 150 nT. Network 4 con-\ntains four observatories and four variometers, two of which\n(Crooktree and York) are relatively close to Eskdalemuir.\nThe latitudinal weighted estimate uses data from Lerwick\n(LER) and Hartland (HAR) observatories.\nFigure 3 compares the estimated magnetic field from the\nSECS and latitudinal weighted methods. The SECS estimate\nmost closely matches the measured data, especially in the X\nand Z components of the magnetic field where the largest\nvariations are observed. In this case, the SECS method\nslightly underestimates the largest spikes seen in the mag-\nnetic field disturbance (e.g. between minutes 75 and 400 in\nthe X component), but is otherwise a good fit. The latitu-\ndinal weighted estimate overestimates the magnitude of the\nchanges in the field, while the SECS (External only) estimate\nagain compares well in X and Y but is extremely poor in Z.\nNote, the SECS (X and Y only) estimate is very similar to\nthe SECS estimate and is not shown.\nThe misfits of the SECS estimate are consistently smaller\nthan the power of the data and provide a significant improve-\nment over the latitudinal weighted estimate for this day. The\nSECS (External only) estimate indicates that modelling of\nthe ionospheric current sheets alone cannot account for the\nobserved magnetic field changes in the Z component.\nThe results of the analysis of power and misfit for all the\nnetworks are given in Table 1, which shows the RMS errors\nof the SECS, latitudinal-weighting, SECS (External only)\nand SECS (X and Y only) estimates for both the magnetically\ndisturbed and magnetically quiet days.

At lower geomagnetic latitudes (Network 5) im-\nprovements are not as marked. In Networks 2 and 3, which\ncover very large areas and have only five and seven obser-\nvatories, respectively, the SECS estimates are not as good,\nparticularly in the Z component on disturbed days. For Net-\nworks 1\u20134, the SECS (External only) estimate is extremely\npoor on disturbed days, again, particularly in the Z compo-\nnent suggesting that reasonable estimates of ground magnetic\nfield disturbances require modelling of the induced magnetic\nfield. By comparing the SECS (External only) mifits with\nthe SECS (X and Y only) misfits, it is clear that solving for\nthe X and Y components using the external field part of the\nSECS equation (i.e. ignoring the Z component) greatly im-\nproves the estimate. However, in general, the SECS (X and\nY only solution) misfits are not consistently smaller than the\nmisfits from solving for the internal and external parts of the\nfield together.\n4.2 Evaluation over three months\nApproximately three months of observatory and variometer\ndata from the beginning of April to start of July 2005 were\nanalysed, comprising of several quiet and relatively disturbed\nperiods. A comparison of the daily power of the data and the\nRMS misfit of the SECS estimate, the latitudinal weighted\nestimate and the SECS (External only) estimate for Net-\nwork 1 are shown in Fig. 4. The SECS method provides a\nconsistent improvement to the estimate compared to the lat-\nitudinal weighting estimate. Results for Networks 2 and 3\nare similar. This longer time series analysis illustrates that\nthe SECS method is most beneficial on disturbed days, but\non quieter days the latitudinal weighting is actually a good\nproxy for the magnetic field, even at widely separated longi-\ntudes. The SECS (External only) estimate has, in general, a\nslightly larger misfit to the observed data in all components.\nThe same period of 96 days of data was analysed for Net-\nwork 4. Figure 5 shows that both the SECS and the latitudi-\nnal weighting methods perform significantly better than pre-\ndicting no external field change. The method of latitudinal\nweighting appears to perform better on days of small mag-\nnetic disturbance, while SECS is better during larger varia-\ntions.

Interestingly, the SECS (External only) esti-\nmate has a lower average misfit in the X component, though\nis markedly poorer in Z.\n5 Discussion\nThe external magnetic field and its influence on the ground\nmagnetic field are still relatively poorly understood. The\nSECS method provides a flexible approach to modelling\nionospheric equivalent currents and is potentially useful in\nspace weather applications, for example. Previous exper-\niments using the SECS method have been primarily con-\nducted with dense magnetometer arrays, such as the BEAR\nand IMAGE networks in Scandinavia (e.g. Pulkkinen et al.,\n2003a; Viljanen et al., 2004). It is certainly reasonable to\nassume that these array configurations are better suited to\nSECS. However, we have shown that the SECS method is\nsimilarly applicable in locations where magnetic measure-\nments are sparsely distributed over large regions. This is\nspecifically where other more developed methods such as the\nFourier method or SCHA have been shown to be insufficient\n(Amm and Viljanen, 1999). Recently, the SECS technique\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/28\/1795\/2010\/ Ann. Geophys., 28, 1795\u20131805, 2010\n1804 S. A. McLay and C. D. Beggan: External magnetic field interpolation using SECS\nhas also been applied in the analysis of magnetospheric and\nionospheric flow vortices with a large set of magnetome-\nter stations in northern America, from Alaska to Green-\nland, involving a number of magnetometer arrays including\nTHEMIS and CARISMA in combination with satellite-based\nobservations (Keiling et al., 2009).\nThe improved estimate of the field from the SECS inter-\npolation method is very noticeable at high geomagnetic lat-\nitudes. The SECS estimate of the field is generally better\nthan latitudinal weighting particularly during magnetically\ndisturbed conditions. In magnetically quiet conditions the\nlatitudinal weighting estimate is comparable or occasionally\nbetter. At lower geomagnetic latitudes, the SECS method\nagain produces the lowest misfit during magnetically active\nconditions but performs less well in very quiet conditions.\nModelling the magnetic field using only the external ele-\nmentary current systems produced misfits which were con-\nsistently poorer. This indicates that solving for internal cur-\nrent systems greatly improves the resulting estimate from the\nSECS method, particularly in the Z component.\nClearly, compared to latitudinal-based interpolation based\non data from two observatories, there is a greater logisti-\ncal and computational cost in acquiring data from a larger\nnumber of observatories to use with the SECS method e.g.\nfor real-time or practical purposes. However, if the data are\navailable, the benefits from the improved estimate, particu-\nlarly during noisy conditions, outweigh the slightly larger\ncomputational costs, as the inversion of the magnetic field\ndata using Singular Value Decomposition and computation\nof the T matrix are extremely fast.\nAs a more sophisticated external field interpolation ap-\nproach, we suggest it could have applications in marine and\naeromagnetic surveying, improving the ability to resolve the\nlocal crustal field, or perhaps in satellite magnetometry to re-\nmove the effects of ionospheric currents for more accurate\nmain field models. Other applications include better real-\ntime estimates of the field for directional drilling and poten-\ntial prediction of geomagnetically-induced currents in power\nsystems.\n6 Conclusions\nInterpolation of the magnetic field over large areas can be\nachieved using Spherical Elementary Current Systems. The\nmethod is derived from Maxwell\u2019s equations and represents a\nphysical rather than a mathematical approach to interpolation\nand extrapolation. We show that the method can be applied\nto produce good estimates of the magnetic field over large re-\ngions using data from a relatively small number of observa-\ntories. In addition to modelling external field variations, we\nfound that including ground induced current systems gave a\nmarked improvement in the estimate of the Z component of\nthe magnetic field.\nAt high geomagnetic latitudes, the SECS method gave the\nbest estimate of the external magnetic field, particularly dur-\ning magnetically active days. At lower latitudes, during mag-\nnetically quiet periods, the SECS method is comparable to\nthe latitudinal weighted average of two observatories, one\napproximately to the north and the other to the south of the\npoint of interest.\nWe have shown that the SECS method can be applied to\nnetworks of different sizes where various densities of ob-\nservatory data are available. In situations where direct mea-\nsurement of the external field is not possible due to logistical\nor physical constraints we suggest the SECS method can be\nused as a powerful interpolation tool.\nAcknowledgements.
