INTRODUCTION\nMOBILE cellular systems are facing new challengescreated by the demand for emerging services and\napplications. Wide range of services with diverse Quality of\nService (QoS) requirements is becoming more popular and\nwidely used. The demand of higher bandwidth and data rates\nhas been increased substantially during recent years. This has\nmade it so important for future mobile cellular systems to\nimplement an efficient resource allocation scheme.\nIn order to achieve efficient resource utilization in all sorts\nof deployment scenarios and QoS requirements in the future\nwireless cellular systems, new resource allocation methods\nmust be developed. In other words, resource allocation has\nto provide optimum or near optimum, for practical reasons,\nutilization of the available radio spectrum in the next gener-\nation of cellular wireless systems regardless of deployment\nscenarios and conditions. However, optimum point has to be\nfound before considering the implementation practicality.\nImportance of resource scheduling was appreciated with the\nsupport of high data rate services in the evolution of UMTS\nManuscript received April 12, 2006; revised December 11, 2006 and March\n20, 2008; accepted April 22, 2008. The associate editor coordinating the\nreview of this paper and approving it for publication was R. Negi. Part of this\nwork has been presented in CCSR\u2019s Research Excellence Award Competition\n2006 and received Research Excellence Award.\nThe authors are with the Mobile Communications Research Group, Centre\nfor Communication Systems Research (CCSR) at the University of Surrey,\nGU2 7XH, United Kingdom (e-mail: M.Abaii@surrey.ac.uk).\nDigital Object Identifier 10.1109\/TWC.2008.060161.\nstandard [Rel99] to High Speed Downlink Packet Access\n(HSDPA) [1] and Enhanced Uplink [2].\nA variety of resource allocation strategies and schemes,\nmainly for downlink, can be found in references [3]-[8]. In\n[3] a system with multiple traffic classes was considered and\nresource allocations were based on the specific characteristics\nof traffic flows resulting in minimization of power consump-\ntion or maximization of system capacity. Under mixed service\ntraffic including both real-time and non-real time services,\nefficient resource allocation from a shared resource pool is\na challenging task due to varied and stringent QoS require-\nments. In [4] authors proposed a fixed resource partitioning\nmethod in which total resource pool was partitioned between\ndifferent service classes and independent resource schedulers\nwere responsible for each resource partition whereas in [5],\nscheduling was more unified and partitioning was dynamic\nto enhance spectral efficiency. Another approach towards\nresource allocation, called utility based approach, tries to\nmaximize the total network utility and thereby enhancing\nresource allocation. For example, pricing is a well-known\nutility function used in [6] for resource allocation. In [7]\nauthors used user\u2019s QoS as utility function and then convert\nthe resource allocation problem into a non-cooperative game\nwhere each user tries to maximize its own utility. A downlink\nresource allocation method based on dynamic pricing was\nproposed in [8] aiming to maximize the summation of users\u2019\nutility.\nOn the link level, adaptive transmission is one of the most\nrecent technologies being investigated for enhancing the spec-\ntral efficiency in future cellular systems [9]. Fast scheduling\ntogether with adaptive modulation-coding, facilitates exploita-\ntion of channel variations resulting in multi-user diversity\ngains [10]. This approach takes advantage of instantaneous\nchannel conditions of different users where the channel fading\nare relatively independent. Adaptive transmissions are more\neffective for low mobility users compared with fast moving\nusers\u2019 channel.\nUplink resource allocation methods can be categorized\nas centralized or decentralized in terms of the network lo-\ncation\/node in which scheduling takes place. In Universal\nMobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) for example, if\nthe scheduler resides in Radio Network Controller (RNC), it\nis called centralized and if it resides in base station it is called\ndecentralized.\nIn an interference-limited system such as UMTS, the uplink\ncell capacity is basically limited by the total received uplink\npower at the base station due to the transmit power limitation\nof user terminals [18]. In decentralized scheduling, each base\n1536-1276\/08$25.00 c\u00a9 2008 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on January 27, 2010 at 11:46 from IEEE Xplore.

Recent studies in Enhanced\nUplink UTRA, also called High Speed Uplink Packet Access\n(HSUPA), show that the decentralized scheduling has better\nperformance compared with centralized one [2]. The subject of\ncentralized versus decentralized scheduling has been studied\nextensively in recent years both in 3rd Generation Project\nPartnership (3GPP) standard body for HSUPA and in the\nliterature [2][26]. In [25] the performance of centralized packet\nscheduler of the UMTS system is evaluated while in [26] the\nperformance of a decentralized scheduling is evaluated and\ncompared with the centralized one in [25].\nThe basic advantage of decentralized over centralized ap-\nproach is due to its fast response to dynamic and fast varying\nenvironment of mobile systems for resource allocation. How-\never, the decentralized scheduling algorithms have an inherent\nshortcoming, due to their vulnerability to intercell interference,\nwhich has not been addressed yet. In other words, considerable\nproportion of RoT at the base station is made up from multiple\naccess intercell interference which the base station has little\nknowledge about or control upon. This in turn may lead the\nsystem to interference outage and poor resource utilization\nparticularly when interfering cells have similar traffic load\nvariations.\nInadequate (intercell) interference management strategy par-\nticularly in highly loaded systems is an inherent problem of\ndecentralized scheduling, regardless of the algorithm being\nused. Several interference mitigation techniques such as Multi\nUser Detection (MUD) [20], Interference cancellation (IC)\n[21], antenna beamforming [22], and their combinations have\nbeen studied extensively and proved to be effective in mitigat-\ning interference to some extent and thereby increase system\ncapacity. However, in a highly loaded system, the problem of\nintercell interference remains an important issue. For instance,\nMUD with Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) detection\nMMSE-MUD is recognised as an effective interference sup-\npression technique for increasing the system capacity [23]. Yet\nit has been demonstrated in [24] that MMSE-MUD performs\napproaches that of a single user band in a fully loaded system.\nFrom the scheduling perspective, although intercell interfer-\nence problem is more severe in decentralized scheduling, it is\nalso present in centralized scheduling due to the fact that the\nintercell interference impact of a scheduled user is not known\nand therefore has not been considered by the central scheduler.\nIn this paper, we address intercell interference problem of\nscheduling process by introducing a new and efficient resource\nallocation strategy called Load Matrix (LM). In order to\nprove the concept, we have used HSUPA system as a case\nstudy. Section II describes the destructing effect of intercell\ninterference on HSUPA decentralized scheduling performance\nin terms of interference outage. In section III we will prove\nthat optimum uplink resource allocation is in fact a Non\ndeterministic Polynomial time (NP)-hard problem in both a\nsingle-cell and multi-cell cases. The Load matrix approach is\ndetailed in section IV. Extensive simulation results on inter-\nference outage, throughput and packet delay performance of\na reference decentralized scheduling [2][11] together with the\nproposed Load Matrix approach are provided and compared\nin section V and finally section VI provides conclusion for\nthis paper.\nIt should be noted that although HSUPA system is used to\ndemonstrate the performance of the Load Matrix, the concept\nis generic for single-carrier spread spectrum based systems\nwhere cell RoT is widely used as a good load indication\ndirectly linked to cell load. In multi-carrier systems however,\nthe load on subcarriers can differ significantly and therefore\nRoT (averaged) is no longer a good measure for load over\nall subcarriers. One can think of an effective RoT instead,\nencouraged by the introduction of effective SINR in multi-\ncarrier systems to provide a better and more accurate link-\nsystem mapping [27]. Finding an effective RoT, however, is\nout of the scope of this paper and Load Matrix approach in\nmulticarrier systems remains for further study. Applicability\nof Load Matrix in a system with adaptive techniques and\nmultiuser scheduling is further explained in section IV.\nII. IMPORTANCE OF INTERCELL INTERFERENCE CONTROL\nUplink cell capacity in interference-limited systems is ba-\nsically limited by the total received power at the base station.\nAs the uplink load increases, user terminals have to increase\ntheir transmit power substantially to overcome the increased\ninterference level at the base station [18]. Due to the fact that\nthe transmit power of user terminals is limited, total received\npower at the base station actually limits the uplink capacity.\nIn decentralized scheduling, each base station assigns radio\nresources (i.e. rate and time) to its users until the estimated\nRoT reaches a predefined target value, RoTtarget. We assume\nRoTtarget is a fixed target value set by the network controller\nto maintain the uplink interference level [2]. The main short-\ncoming for decentralized scheduling in general becomes more\nvisible in a multi-cell scenario where a considerable proportion\nof RoT is intercell interference and base station has little\nknowledge about and control upon. By intercell interference\nhere, we mean intercell multiple-access interference in general\ni.e. any signal received by a base station coming from those\nusers which belong to other cells. The relation between cell\nRoT and intercell interference is given in (1). The RoT of\ncell j (RoTj) is defined as the total in-band received power at\nbase station j (BSj) over thermal noise. Let be the received\nnoise power in BSj , bsj be the set of BSj users, Pi be the\ntransmission power of user i and Gi,j be the channel gain\nfrom useri to BSj . For M active users in the network, RoTj\ncan then be written as:\nRoTj =\n\u239b\n\u239d M\u2211\ni=1,i\u2208bsj\nPiGij +\nM\u2211\ni=1,i\/\u2208bsj\nPiGij +N \u2032\n\u239e\n\u23a0 \/N \u2032\n(1)\nFor simplicity, we have not considered soft hand over in this\npaper meaning the user is connected only to one base station\nat a time.\nTo highlight the importance of intercell interference prob-\nlem and show the impact of it in the overall interference outage\nperformance and resource utilization, we set up a specific\nsimulation scenario. In this scenario, all the cells have same\ntraffic distribution and interference condition (i.e. identical\nuser distribution per cell). In each cell 10 users with full buffer\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on January 27, 2010 at 11:46 from IEEE Xplore.

Same user distribution makes the\nscheduling order and therefore generated interference exactly\nthe same in all cells. We have chosen this extreme scenario\nto highlight the effect of intercell interference in its extreme\nsituation as the worst case scenario.\nWe also use wrap-around technique, which makes all the\ncells identical. Users are randomly and uniformly distributed\nover one cell and then repeated with identical pattern over\nother cells. Other simulation parameters are same as in table II.\nWe use the decentralized scheduling algorithm in [11] which\nallocates resources individually in each cell. Assumption of\nfull buffer occupancy for users helps to model and study the\nnetwork behaviour under heavy traffic load.\nFigure 1 shows the RoT fluctuation of a typical cell in this\nscenario for a period of 1 second. Transmission Time Interval\n(TTI) is considered 10ms. At TTI= 1140, RoT level is way\nbelow the RoTtarget so scheduler decides to allocate resource\nto more users unaware that all other cells will do the same\nthing. The consequence of this decision is much higher RoT\nthan expected in the next scheduling interval. At TTI= 1150,\nthe opposite happens; RoT level prior to scheduling instant is\nway above the RoT target so scheduler severely decreases the\namount of allocated resources unaware that all other cells will\ndo the same thing. This phenomenon continues and RoT takes\na pulsy shape far from RoTtarget as shown in figure 1.\nAs mentioned earlier, this is the worst case scenario in\nrespect to the intercell interference problem. Nevertheless,\nsome degree of fluctuation (less than the case shown in figure\n1) has been observed in RoT regardless of the scheduling\ntype or algorithm being used. RoT fluctuation obviously gets\nworse when the traffic load increases. We have assumed an\nextreme scenario where the load in neighbouring cells varies in\na synchronised way which is not realistic. In reality however,\nin peak hour it is expected that neighbouring cells are all\nfacing very high traffic (i.e. users with full buffers waiting\nfor transmission) at the same time. Also it is likely to have\nsimilar traffic behaviour in neighbouring cells since they are\ngeographically close and therefore may have users with similar\nsocial environments and activities.\nThis case study clearly shows that intercell interference is\na crucial factor which can not be ignored in the scheduling\nprocess for future wireless cellular systems.\nIII. RESOURCE ALLOCATION PROBLEM\nThe aim of resource allocation in wireless cellular system\nis to assign radio resources to individual users in a way to\nachieve maximum system capacity whilst meeting the required\nquality of service. In this section, we formulate the resource\nallocation problem in wireless cellular system and show that\nit is an NP-hard problem [13]. We consider a basic scenario\nwhere resource allocation is down to assigning transmission\nrate and time to individual users with the objective of through-\nput maximization. To analyze the problem, we begin with the\nsingle cell scenario and then extend the conclusion to the\nmulti-cell case. Without loss of generality, we assume that\ntransmission rates are chosen from a limited set of rates.\nLet Si,1 denote Candidate Rate Set (CRS) of user i, which\nincludes all the allowed transmission rates for the user to\nchoose from. Rate \u201d0\u201d is always included in Si,1, and will be\nchosen if the user is not scheduled to transmit in the current\nscheduling instant. We treat transmission rates in different\nCRSs as different items even if they have the same rate value:\nSi,1\n\u22c2\nSj,1 = \u03a6 \u2200i \u0003= j (2)\nLet S1 denote the union of all the CRSs from S1,1 to\nSM1,1, and M1 is the total number of users in the cell\nsharing the radio resource pool. Choosing an element t from\nset S1 is an assignment action, which means allocating a\nspecific transmission rate to a particular user. Apparently, each\nassignment action generates a certain amount of throughput\nwhile consumes some amount of the cell capacity. We use\nbinary variable xt to indicate whether element t is chosen\nor not (1 for \u2019Yes\u2019 and 0 for \u2019No\u2019). pt and ct,1 denote the\ngenerated throughput and consumed cell capacity respectively\nif element t is chosen. pt is equal to the transmission rate itself,\nwhereas ct,1 can be interpreted differently, e.g. as consumed\nBS transmit power or generated load factor [12], depending\non the system type.\nUsing above terms and definitions, the Single Cell Radio\nAllocation Problem (SCRAP) can be described as follows:\ngiven a particular system snapshot (cell capacity, user location,\npropagation and traffic status etc.), how to choose elements\nfrom set S1 in each scheduling instant so as to achieve\nmaximum system throughput, subject to the following two\nconstraints: C1 : The aggregated cell capacity consumption of\nall the chosen elements from S1 should be less than the total\navailable cell capacity Cap1. C2 : for each CRS (S1,1 , ,\nSM1,1), only one element is chosen. Mathematically, SCRAP\ncan be formulated as follows:\nmaximize : p =\n\u2211\nt\u2208S1\nptxt (3)\nsubject to: \u2211\nt\u2208S1\nct,1xt \u2264 Cap1 (4)\n\u2211\nt\u2208S1\nxt = 1 i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,M1 (5)\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

MCKP can be expressed as follows:\nGiven a knapsack, an item set, and a partition of the item\nset into a number of subsets, how we choose items so as to\nmaximize the total profit from all the chosen items, while\nthe aggregate weight of all the chosen items is less than\nthe allowed weight bearing of the knapsack. There is also a\ncondition that only one item is chosen from each item subset.\nSCRAP can be mapped to MCKP by regarding the knapsack\ncapacity as the available cell capacity, the item set as the set\nS1, and the item subsets as CRSs (S1,1 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , SM1,1). Also pt\nand ct,1 can be regarded as the profit and weight of element\nt respectively.\nIn MCKP all the components of the problem including\nknapsack capacity, items, profits, etc. are known and the\nquestion is which items to put in the knapsack. Similarly in\nthe SCRAP, the only unknown in equations (3)-(6) is xt. pt\nis known because it is equal to the transmission rate itself. In\nCDMA uplink systems, ct,1 and Cap1 can be interpreted as\nthe load factor of the given user (e.g. 10%) and the maximum\nload threshold of the cell (e.g. 70%) respectively. Then the\nfollowing way can be used to calculate ct,1 for each element\nt before the rate allocation actually takes place: 1) find out\nthe target SINR at the receiver based on the given data rate\nand BLock Error Rate (BLER). These target SINRs can be\nobtained from the BLER versus SINR performance curves in\nthe physical layer (also known as link to system mapping); 2)\nThis target SINR can then be transformed into the load factor,\ni.e. ct, with the equation: load factor = SINR\/(1+SINR) [12].\nMoreover, in this single-cell scenario considered, no intercell\ninterference exists, therefore the available cell capacity Cap1\ncan be regarded exactly the same as the given cell capacity,\nwhich is assumed to be a fixed and pre-known value in\nour work. Furthermore, CRSs (S1,1 to SM1,1) are pre-known\nsets based on the system restrictions, power headroom and\nqueue status of individual users. Therefore, SCRAP is a type\nof Multi-Choice Knapsack Problem and NP-hardness of it\nfollows by a trivial transformation from the MCKP.\nWe now consider the multi-cell case of the problem\n(MCRAP), where the interested area is covered by N cells,\nwith total number of M users (i.e.\n\u2211N\nj=1Mj = M with Mj\nrepresenting the number of users in cell j). In this case, ct,1\nand Cap1 are upgraded to ct, j and Capj where the subscript\nj represents the cell index:\u2211\nt\u2208Sj\nct,jxt \u2264 Capj \u2200j = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , N (7)\nIn which ct,j is the consumed capacity from cell j if element\nt is chosen. The expression of MCRAP is very similar to\nSCRAP except that constraint C1 should be replaced by the\nfollowing C1\u2019 in order to take all the cells into account:\nC1\u2019: For any cell j (j = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , N ), the total cell capacity\nconsumption by all the chosen elements from Sj should be\nless than the total available cell capacity Capj . In fact, SCRAP\nwas the simplest case of MCRAP where N=1. Consequently,\nif SCRAP is not solvable by a polynomial time algorithm,\nneither is MCRAP and therefore MCRAP is also NP-hard.\nIV. LOAD MATRIX CONCEPT\nOne of the main challenges in resource allocation in a\nmulticell system is the control of intercell interference. In\nuplink scheduling, the basic problem is to assign appropriate\ntransmission rate and time to all active users in such a way\nthat result in maximum radio resource utilization across the\nnetwork whilst satisfying the QoS requirements of all the\nusers. Amongst other constraints, another important factor in\nthe resource allocation is the user\u2019s transmit power. For a\nnetwork of M users and N cells the constraints to be satisfied\nare Cnst1 : For each active user i in the network, its transmit\npower Pi must be maintained in an acceptable region defined\nas\n0 \u2264 Pi \u2264 P\u2212,max i \u2208 {1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,M} (8)\nPi,max is the maximum transmission power available to\nthe user due to hardware limitation and\/or any other restric-\ntions. Cnst2 : The total received power at base station should\nbe kept below a certain threshold for all N base stations in the\nnetwork (as a load control measure in a single-carrier Spread\nSpectrum system). We use Rise over Thermal noise (RoT) as\ndefined in HSUPA [2] to represent the interference constraints.\nRoTj is the total in-band received power at the base station j\n(BSj) over thermal noise. Let N \u2032 be the receiver noise power\nin a BS, Pi be the transmission power of user i and Gi,j be\nthe channel gain from user i to BS j. For M active users in\nthe network, RoTj can be written as\nRoTj =\n(\nN \u2032 +\nM\u2211\ni=1\nPiGij\n)\n\/N \u2032 (9)\nIn this case Cnst2 can be formulated as\nRoTj \u2264 RoTtarget j \u2208 {1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , N} (10)\nwhere RoTtarget is assumed to be a fixed target value set by\nthe network operator to maintain the uplink interference level.\nCnst3 : For each user, depending on its channel type (e.g.\npedestrian, vehicular) and speed, each rate k has a minimum\nrequired SINR called SINRtarget,k. SINRtarget,k is the signal\nto noise plus interference ratio required at the serving base\nstation j if rate k is being assigned to the user in order to\nachieve a given block\/frame error rate.

Centralized LM scheduling in a 3G LTE system.\nthe 3rd Generation Long-Term Evolution (3G LTE) [17]. We\nassume the averaged channel gain (over the scheduling period)\nfrom users to base stations is known to scheduler prior to rate\nassignment. In a network of M users and N cells, LMi, j is\nthe load factor [12] contributed by user i at BS j\nLMi,j =\nPiGij\nN \u2032 +\n\u2211M\nm=1 PmGmj\n(12)\nFrom the LMi, j values stored in column j of LM database,\nRoT of cell j can be written as\nRoTj =\n1\n1\u2212\u2211Mi=1 LMi,j (13)\nNote that RoTj obtained from (13) is identical to RoTj\ndefinition given in (9). Let BS j be the serving base station\nfor user i which controls user\u2019s transmission power and Gi,j\nbe the total channel gain from user i to BS j averaged over\nscheduling period. SINRi, j can be written as\nSINRi,j =\nPiGi,j\nN \u2032RoTj \u2212 PiGi,j (14)\nLet pi,k be the required transmit power for user i should it\nbe assigned the rate . Starting with the highest applicable rate\nfrom the set (i.e. k = K), for rate k to be assigned to user\ni, (11) must be satisfied. Therefore the minimum required\nSINRi, j is SINRtarget,k . Also recall the aim of LM rate\nassignment to keep RoTj always as close as possible (ideally\nequal) to RoTtarget. By rearrangement of (14), replacing\nSINRi,j with SINRtarget,k, Pi with pi,k , and RoTj with\nRoTtarget, required transmit power for user i (should it be\nassigned rate k) can be found as\npi,k =\nN \u2032RoTTarget\nGi,j\nSINRtarget,k\n1 + SINRtarget,k\n(15)\nHowever, rate k and consequently pi,k is acceptable if and only\nif all three constraints are satisfied. First of all, pi,k obtained\nfrom (15) must satisfy Cnst1 which states the maximum\nuser\u2019s transmit power. Cnst3 constraint is already satisfied\nby considering SINRtarget,k. as SINRi, j. Additionally, pi,k\nmust satisfy the Cnst2 which takes into account the impact of\nassigning rate k to user i on the intercell interference. This\nensures the intercell interference caused by user i in other cell\ndoes not increase other cells\u2019 RoT above RoTtarget. In order\nto check this, next step is to update LMi,n for all the elements\nin row i of Load Matrix. LMi,n is the load factor imposed by\nuser i in cell n using rate k defined as\nLMi,n =\nPi,kGin\nN \u2032 +\n\u2211M\nm=1 PmGmn\n(16)\nFrom (13) one can estimate the new RoT for all other cells\nand check if the Cnst2 constraint has been satisfied. If so the\nrate k is the highest acceptable rate for user i and will be\nassigned, otherwise the same process is repeated for the rate\nk\u22121 and so on. If at the end, none of the rates k \u2208 {1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,K}\ncan satisfy the three constraints, user i will not be scheduled\nfor transmission at this scheduling instant and will be given\nhigher priority for the following scheduling instant. After the\nfirst round of rate assignment to all users, LM elements are\nupdated and new RoT is calculated for each cell using (13).\nThis is necessary because (15) and (16) are valid only if RoT\nis close to the RoTtarget. Since the rate assignment is an\nNP-complete problem (see section III), it is not possible to\nexactly achieve RoTtarget in all cells in the first round of rate\nassignment. This requires additional rounds (which we refer to\nit as iterations) of rate\/power adjustments in order to minimize\nthe difference between a cell RoT and its RoTtarget. In other\nwords, at each scheduling instant, pi,k is iteratively adjusted\nin (15) and then (16) by replacing RoTtarget with updated\nRoT from LM in (13) after each round of rate assignment.\nThis check is an important step ensuring low probability of\ninterference outage by keeping RoT below RoTtarget and at\nthe same time increasing resource utilization with highest\ncell RoT possible (i.e. RoT close to RoTtarget). Obviously\nthe number of iterations depends on the difference between\nRoT and RoTtarget at the end of each scheduling process.\nHowever, the simulation results presented in section V are\nwith no iteration and yet the difference between RoT and\nRoTtarget was found to be negligible. It should be noted\nthat if a user is not in the full buffer status, the maximum\nrate index K in (11) is limited to a rate that would result\nin emptying the buffer at the next scheduling instant. Cell or\nnetwork throughput per bandwidth (bps\/Hz\/cell) is often taken\nas resource utilization measure. However, there is a trade off\nbetween maximum cell throughput and fairness amongst users\n[15]. Priority functions are used to rank users in the scheduling\nprocess and make a balance between cell throughput and\nfairness. Commonly used priority functions are Round Robin,\nDL SINR (also called Max C\/I), Proportional Fair (see e.g.\n[1][2][16]) and also most recently introduced Score-Based\n[19]. The Round Robin tries to maximize fairness amongst\nusers regardless of a user channel condition and therefore\nresults in poor throughput performance. Max C\/I on the other\nhand, ranks users in terms of their channel quality and aiming\nfor maximizing cell throughput at the expense of fairness. Both\nProportional Fair and Score-based functions performance are\nbetter than Round Robin in terms of throughput and better\nthan Max C\/I in terms of fairness.

Load Matrix Algorithm.\nprovides a generic solution for resource scheduling that does\nnot preclude any priority function and can be combined with\nany of them. However, priority function has major impact\non overall system performance for any scheduling algorithm\nincluding the LM. Here a priority function is introduced based\non a user\u2019s load vector that includes intra and intercell impact\non the network. It is evident that giving priority to a user\nwith better channel condition increases the cell throughput\nbut in a multicell network could have severe impact on the\nthroughput of other cell\u2019s. Here it is considered by defining\nGlobal Proportional Priority function as\npriorityi =\nGi,j\u2211N\nn=1,n\u0004=j Gi,n\n\u2200i \u2208 {1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,M} (17)\nwhere Gi,j is the total channel gain from user i to BS j\naveraged over the scheduling period. The LM approach tries\nto maximize network capacity through inter and intracell inter-\nference management. Table I summarises LM algorithm used\nfor rate assignment in a multicell wireless system. The first\nstep is initialization where all the LM elements are set to zero\nand also users in each cell are sorted according to the priority\nfunction in (17). The LM allocation process simultaneously\nincreases allocated resources in each cell to avoid interference\nimbalance amongst the cells. The process consists of a number\nof assignment rounds equal to the maximum number of users\nper cell (e.g. 10 rounds for 10 users per cell as stated in\nTable II). In each round, the LM assigns rates to the highest\npriority user in each cell, updates LM elements and performs\ncapacity checking. Capacity Check (CC) function calculates\nRoT as in (13) and compares with RoTtarget making sure\n(10) is always satisfied. Passing this \u201dcheck\u201d means assigned\nrates are valid and will not cause interference outage. If CC\nfails, scheduler attempts the next available rate and continues\nuntil CC is satisfied. Then the user is considered scheduled\nand will be removed from the user priority list of its serving\ncell. The scheduling process continues until all the users are\nprocessed. In the LM scheduling process, the CC function\nis especially important and plays a major role in the overall\nsystem performance. In particular, a margin concept rather\nthan a fixed threshold for RoTtarget is introduced. The CC\noperates on this small margin around RoTtarget instead of a\nfixed RoTtarget threshold. Two independent margin variables\nFig. 3. PDF of RoT (inter-cell margin effect).\ncalled intercell margin and intracell margin are specified for\nhandling intercell and intracell interference respectively and\nassist better decision during the CC process. The intracell\nmargin is a region set around the RoTtarget where a serving\ncell\u2019s user loading should not exceed. Similarly, intercell mar-\ngin is another region specified around RoTtarget which limits\nvariations of overall RoT caused by a user from other cells.\nThe intercell and intracell margins can be equal or different\nresulting in different performances. It is shown in section V\nthat maintaining RoT in a small margin around RoTtarget\ninstead of using a single RoTtarget threshold will result gener-\nally in a much improved interference outage performance and\nhigher resource utilization. The concept of the Load Matrix\ncan be used in conjunction with other adaptive techniques and\npriority functions. In single carrier Spread Spectrum systems,\nRoTtarget defines the maximum cell capacity even though the\ninstantaneous capacity in a cell is not fixed. In other words,\nthe CC function explained above regards a cell as fully loaded\nonly when its estimated RoT reaches RoTtarget. That means\ncell capacity is not a direct function of the transmission rates\nbeing assigned. The LM concept operates on RoT, channel\ngains and the specified constraints such as user power and\navailable rates. These are common parameters in CDMA\nbased mobile cellular systems although their calculations are\ndifferent for different air interface standards, and dependant\non the network architecture. In this paper, to demonstrate\nthe performance of the Load Matrix, the HSUPA standard\nwas chosen for this purpose. HSUPA and HSDPA were the\nfirst standards which seriously address the importance of the\nscheduling problem.\nV. SIMULATION RESULTS\nTo evaluate the performance of the LM concept, extensive\nsystem level simulations have been carried out using HSUPA\n[2]. The results are compared with the scheduler in [11]\nthat is also used as a benchmark for comparison in [2].\nSimulation parameters used for both the benchmark and the\nLM algorithms are shown in Table II.

It should be emphasised that the main\nobjective in this paper is to highlight the impact of other\ncell interference existing in both centralized and decentral-\nized scheduling algorithms. Another important objective is to\nshow the performance of the scheduling algorithms compared\nwith the upper-bound limit rather than comparison between\ndifferent algorithms. Comparison with the upper-bound limit\nis a better indication of scheduling algorithm efficiency. Here\nthe upper-bound limit on the interference outage performance\nis defined as a \u201cstep function\u201d in CDF of RoT ( as represented\nby target RoT in figures 4,6 and 8). Interference outage\nperformance directly affects all other performance measures\nlike throughput and packet delay. The comparison with the\nbenchmark algorithm is provided here as an example to show\nthe effectiveness of the LM scheduling compared with a\ntypical scheduling algorithm used in [2]. General comparison\nbetween centralized and decentralized scheduling is already\navailable in literature e.g. in [26]. The system level simulator\nmodels 19 omni-directional cell structure with 10 users per cell\nrandomly and uniformly distributed.

The\nsimulation results provided here have two different objectives.\nThe first objective is to show the impact of the margin concept\n(both intercell and intracell) on the interference outage perfor-\nmance. These are shown in figures 3-6. The second objective\nis to illustrate the performance of the LM (based on the best\nmargin setup) compared with the benchmark algorithm and\nthe upper-bound limit in terms of interference outage. Figures\n7 and 8 show the performance in terms of interference outage,\nwhereas service throughput and packet delay performances are\ndepicted in figure 9 and figures 10-11 respectively. The figures\n3 and 4 where no intracell margin was considered, show the\nProbability Density Function (PDF) and Cumulative Density\nFunction (CDF) of RoT respectively for benchmark algorithm\nand three LM cases. The LM case one represents no intercell\nmargin i.e. \u201cno hysteresis\u201d while the other two cases represent\nintercell margins of +1% and +2%. These figures demonstrate\nconsiderable performance in interference outage compared\nwith the benchmark algorithm and a close performance to the\nupper-bound limit indicating the sensitivity of performance to\nintercell margin. Same behaviour can be observed in figures\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on January 27, 2010 at 11:46 from IEEE Xplore.

Average service throughput versus distance.\n5 and 6 where intracell margin is used instead of intercell. It\nshould be noted that intercell and intracell margins has positive\nand negative values with respect to RoTtarget. This is due to\nthe fact that under all the conditions, the intracell interference\nis more dominant than the intercell interference. Therefore\nthe LM capacity check has to be more strict with own cell\nusers contribution to cell loading by not permitting RoT to\nexceed the RoTtarget. However, it can show more flexibility in\naccommodating the other cell interference allowing their con-\ntribution to RoT exceed the RoTtarget but within the specified\nintercell margin. In order to find an appropriate set of intercell\nand intracell margin, we have carried out simulations for all\n25 combinations of intercell margin= [0, 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, 2%]\nand intracell margin= [0, 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, 2%]. Figures 7 and\n8 represent the interference outage performance of the best\nthree combinations. The LM approach outperforms the bench-\nmark algorithm, in all cases, with a very close performance\nto the upper-bound limit. The figure 9 shows the service\nthroughput versus distance from a base station for the LM\nand the benchmark algorithms.

Figure 11 shows that with the LM\napproach, 95% of the packets experience delay of less than 40\nTTI compared with 200 TTI experienced by the benchmark\nalgorithm. It is worth noting that all the LM results presented\nin this paper are achieved with no iteration, as described in\nsection IV, resulting in negligible interference outage as can\nbe observed when comparing with the upper-bound limit.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nA novel approach towards efficient resource allocation for\nfuture wireless cellular systems was presented. The vulnerabil-\nity of traditional resource allocation and scheduling schemes\nto intercell interference resulting in interference fluctuations\nwas demonstrated. Such interference fluctuation results in\ncapacity wastage and excessive packet delay performance.\nThe Load Matrix concept presented addresses this problem\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Simulation Parameters.\nspecifically and provides an efficient resource allocation by\njointly considering intercell and intracell interference before\nmaking decision on allocating radio resources. Extensive sim-\nulation results for the LM demonstrated its capability through\nconsiderable performance improvements over the benchmark\nscheduling algorithm in terms of both averaged packet delay\nand cell throughput. The performance was also shown to be\nvery close to the upper-bound limit of interference outage. By\nincorporating a new concept of separate margins for intercell\nand intracell interferences into the LM, it was shown that bet-\nter control over such interferences can be provided resulting in\nhigh overall network performance. As an example, in the LM\napproach interference can be always kept close to the specified\ntarget whilst average cell throughput can be increased by more\nthan 30% compared with a well known benchmark scheduling\nalgorithm. Although HSUPA system level simulator is used in\nthis paper to produce the performance results, the concept is\ngeneric for single-carrier spread spectrum based systems. In\ncase of multi-carrier systems, the load on subcarriers can differ\nsignificantly and therefore RoT (averaged) is no longer a good\nmeasure for load over all subcarriers. It will be interesting to\ninvestigate the possibility of finding an effective RoT instead,\nto provide a better and more accurate measure for cell load in\nthose systems. Effective RoT and application of Load Matrix\nin multicarrier systems remains for further study.\nREFERENCES\n[1] 3GPP TR 25.848, \u201cPhysical layer aspects of UTRA High Speed Downlink\nPacket Access V4.0.0,\u201d www.3gpp.org, Mar. 2001.\n[2] 3GPP TR 25.896, \u201cFeasibility Study of Enhanced Uplink for UTRA\nFDD V6.0.0,\u201d www.3gpp.org, Mar. 2004.\n[3] I.
