Inter-\norganizational systems (IOS) have become an established means of exchanging\ninformation and effecting transactions between partners in most industries. Although\nthere is a recognition that IOS can have an impact on IOR, the inter-relationship\nbetween these is not well understood. For example, the emergence of new internet\nenabled forms of IOS, such as electronic marketplaces (Kaplan and Sawhney, 2000; Dai\nand Kauffman, 2002) were heralded as a means of organizations finding and building\nrelationships with new trading partners easily and inexpensively. However, given the\nhigh closure rates of e-marketplaces, it would appear that such a view of the relationship\nbetween IOS and IOR was simplistic and even incorrect (Helper and McDuffie, 2003).\nGiven that companies may have a variety of reasons for entering and maintaining inter-\norganizational relationships, it has been suggested (Dwyer et al. 1987; Jap and Mohr,\n2002) that the multidimensionality of the exchange process can only be captured by\nincluding factors from both IOR and IOS perspectives and hence in this study we sought\nto combine both approaches. In particular, the study explores how, at the level of\nindividual constructs drawn from the IOR and IOS literatures, the use of IOS affects,\nand is affected by, both IOR and the perceived performance of the e-trading relationship\nand also how IOR affects the perceived performance and is affected by it. The work\nseeks to integrate and extend existing knowledge and hence uses a deductive approach\nof deriving a proposed framework from existing IOS and IOR literatures, which is\nvalidated by application to a specific context - the European paper industry. Since both\nIOS and IOR by definition impact both organisations involved in the partnership, this\nresearch adopts a dyadic approach.\nThe paper commences with a brief review of the distinct theoretical bases adopted for\nextant IOS and IOR studies and a summary of previous literature that brings together\nthese two perspectives. A research framework, developed from these literatures is then\npresented, followed by the methodology adopted for the empirical stage of this work.\nThe framework is then applied to the findings of the case studies. The framework can\nexplain the differing relationship between IOR and IOS found in the cases and it also\noffers a logical rationale for combining the theoretical bases that, to date, tended have to\nbe used in isolation when considering either IOS or IOR. The conclusions and\nimplications of the study are discussed and limitations are noted.\nTheoretical Bases of IOR and IOS\nThe theoretical bases for IOR studies include Resource Dependency Theory (Pfeffer\nand Salancik, 1978) and Social Exchange Theory (Homans, 1958; Levine and White,\n1961). The former theory proposes that firms rely on other firms for essential resources\n4and will want to minimise this dependence, whilst wishing to increase the dependence\nof other firms on them. This brings the notion of coordination, to ensure the effective\nutilisation of the resources sourced from other firms, and dependency between firms\ninto the consideration of trading relationships. Social Exchange Theory (SET), rather\nthan consider exchanges between two organisations, considers exchanges between\nspecific individual actors and characterises these as \u2018actions contingent on rewarding\nactions from others\u2019 (Blau, 1964). SET therefore suggests that the notions of\ninterpersonal trust and bonds and cooperation should also be included in a consideration\nof e-trading relationships.\nConsistent with these theories, empirical studies (Cunningham, 1980; Ford, 1980;\nH\u00e5kansson, 1980) have noted that, rather than the traditional adversarial perspective,\ncooperation between trading and exchange partners represents a more accurate view of\nreality. IOR are conceptualised as dyadic interactions at both the company and\nindividual level with interaction influenced by the atmosphere, a multidimensional\nconstruct involving power\/dependence, cooperation, expectations, closeness and the\nenvironment of the interaction (H\u00e5kansson and Wootz, 1979). Relationship marketing\n(RM) provides another stream of literature relevant to IOR. As companies form\npartnerships for the purpose of achieving goals that they could not attain individually\n(Vlosky and Wilson, 1995), these relationships are held together by normative as\nopposed to contractual methods (Weitz and Jap, 1995).\nThe IOS literature is again extensive and draws from multiple theoretical bases (Kumar\nand Crook, 1999) including Transaction Cost Economics (TCE) (Williamson, 1985) and\nAgency Theory (Ross, 1973). TCE, which is based upon the notion of rational\nbehaviour, although this is recognised to be bounded in nature (Chiles and McMackin,\n1996), proposes that firms will seek to reduce the transaction or coordination costs\nincurred in trading with other firms. Whilst in-house production or hierarchical\nstructures (Malone et al, 1987; Clemons et al, 1993) can reduce such costs, for those\nfirms that must engage in trading relationships due to resource dependency, e-trading\nappears to offer a means of reducing transaction costs (Malone et al, 1987). The cost of\neach individual transaction will be minimised if set up and ongoing costs of the e-\ntrading link are as low as possible and amortised over as a large number of transactions.\nHence TCE suggests high volumes and a breadth or diversity of transactions and\nincreased system-to-system integration will reduce ongoing transaction costs. The\nprincipal-agent problem that characterises Agency Theory, suggests that firms acting as\nprincipals will seek to align the interests of their trading partners with their own\ninterests, suggesting the notion of a priori and ongoing expectations of the trading\narrangement.\nCunningham and Tynan (1993) and Fredriksson and Vilgon (1996) represent some of\nthe earlier attempts at bridging IOR and IOS literatures. The latter authors recognise\nthat e-trading benefits do not originate solely from the use of IOS, \u201cbut arise from\ninteraction with human, organizational, industrial organization, networking and other\ncompetitive aspects\u201d (p.5). Nidumolu (1995), in a similar manner to Fredriksson and\nVilgon (1996), includes process-related aspects of IOR when considering IOS. Factors\nrelating to efficiency, goal compatibility, domain consensus and norms of exchange, are\nconsidered to account for the relationship sentiments between companies participating\nin e-trading. Bensaou (1997) found that \u201cpredictions made by a transaction cost\n5analysis\u201d were supported, however \u201crelational as well as technological factors must be\nadded to the equation\u201d (p.120).\nA Proposed Framework from Extant Literature\nFigure 1 shows the proposed framework, which consists of three dimensions: E-trading\nUse, Exchange Climate and Performance Satisfaction. E-trading Use is characterised\nby constructs drawn from IOS (e.g. Iacovou et al. 1995; Hart and Saunders, 1998;\nMasseti and Zmud, 1996). This use is affected by, and affects the IOR, characterised in\nthe model by the Exchange Climate (e.g. Wilson, 1995; Anderson and Narus, 1990;\nMorgan and Hunt, 1994). Finally, as suggested by Social Exchange Theory and\nobserved by Vijayasarathy and Robey (1997), participants must evaluate performance in\nthe relationship favourably for it to survive; hence a Performance Satisfaction\ndimension is included.\nThe meta-analysis of buyer-supplier relationships conducted by Wilson (1995) was\ntaken as a starting point of the identification of constructs to include within each\ndimension of the research framework. From this, constructs that were clearly distinct\nfrom each other and were consistent with the theoretical bases adopted were identified\nfor inclusion in the initial framework. As with the derivation of most research\nframeworks, the intention was to be as parsimonious as possible, whilst retaining the\nlevel of detail necessary to differentiate between various instances of the phenomenon\nbeing studied. The set of constructs identified was tested during the empirical stage of\nthe study and found to be robust and sufficient. Each of the constructs within the three\ndimensions of the research framework is discussed in turn below.\nThat the use of IOS will affect the IOR, and vice versa, identified in the earlier studies\nthat seek to bridge IOR and IOS (e.g. Cunningham and Tynan, 1993) and that IOS and\nIOR, both separately and in combination, will affect e-trading Performance Satisfaction\n(Fredriksson and Vilgon, 1996; Nidumolu, 1995), suggests feedback loops between the\nthree dimensions of the proposed framework. The three dimensions of the framework\nare therefore linked by double headed arrows, denoting that influence can occur in\neither or both directions. A circle is used to join the arrows, to denote the opportunity\nfor vicious and virtuous cycles observed by Gallivan and Depledge (2003) to arise\nbetween the dimensions of the framework.\nE-Trading Use Constructs\nAs discussed in the previous section, Agency Theory suggests that companies have\ncertain expectations of their e-trading with partners, which will influence their\ninvestment and involvement. This has been confirmed by empirical studies (Allen et al.\n2000; Iacovou et al. 1995). An expectations construct is therefore included in the\nframework. Masseti and Zmud (1996) use the concept of volume to refer to the\nproportion of an organisation\u2019s total document exchanges with a partner that are\nhandled electronically and diversity as the number of different types of standardised\nbusiness documents supported by the electronic exchange. Consistent with the\nefficiency of transactions notion incorporated in TCE, these authors use volume,\ndiversity and system to system integration as useful measures of the extent of e-trading\nuse between organisations.\n6Exchange Climate Constructs\nThe literature on marketing channels has commonly found trust to be an important\nfactor in trading relationships (Anderson and Narus, 1990; Cummings and Bromley,\n1996; Heide and John, 1990; Zaheer et al, 1998) and it\u2019s role as a prerequisite for EDI\nadoption and use has also been noted (e.g., Hart and Saunders, 1998). A common\nfeature of the development of IOS is the need for various departments or groups from\nthe two firms to work together that may not have previously interacted. Bonds\nrepresent this level of \u2018interconnectedness\u2019 between a buyer and seller (Kalafatis, 2000).\nIncluded in the construct are structural bonds, which are the elements that create\nimpediments to the termination of the relationship, and social bonds, which are the\ndegree of personal friendships and liking shared by the buyer and seller (Wilson, 1995).\nStructural bonds incorporate the concepts of dependence and power suggested by\nResource Dependency Theory and recognised in other studies (e.g. Fontenot and\nWilson, 1997; Lewin and Johnston, 1997). Coordination describes the alignment of\ndistinct but interdependent activities (Malone and Crowston, 1994) and consists of\nprotocols, tasks and decision mechanisms designed to achieve concerted actions\nbetween interdependent units.\nCooperation is defined by Anderson and Narus (1990) as coordinated actions\nundertaken by firms to achieve superior outcomes with expected reciprocation over\ntime. This construct therefore also incorporates the concept of commitment identified\nby others (e.g. Anderson and Weitz, 1990; Mavondo and Rodrigo, 2001; Wilson and\nVlosky, 1998; Walter et al, 2003). Finally, whilst conflict is not explicitly recognised in\nthe underlying theoretical bases of this study, it is implicit in them. Whilst it may act\nsimply reduce the extent of the above constructs, it is explicitly included as a construct\nin the research framework, since it can provide the opportunity to identify and further\nexplore the sources of conflict and their impact. Explicit recognition of conflict is\nconsistent with studies such as those by Anderson and Narus (1990) and Nakayama\n(2003).\nPerformance Satisfaction Constructs\nVijayasarathy and Robey (1997) note \u201cfor an inter-organizational relationship to\nsurvive, participants must evaluate performance in the relationship favourably and be\nsatisfied that it will achieve individual and collective goals\u201d (p.76). This notion of\nperformance satisfaction, which is consistent with SET, is captured in the two\nconstructs; benefits and barriers. Benefits represent an overall measure of the cost of\nestablishing and maintaining the e-trading relationship compared to the expected\noutcomes. Included in this construct are both operational and strategic benefits (Fearon\nand Philip, 1999; Suomi, 1988). Operational benefits include cost reduction and\nproductivity improvements (e.g. reduced re-keying of information and simplification of\norder processing tasks), whilst strategic benefits are associated with increased sales\nvolumes, the development of new products or access to new markets or new\norganisational capabilities (Reekers and Smithson, 1994; Mukhopadhyay and Kekre,\n2002).\nIn a similar approach taken to the notion of conflict, whilst barriers (Crum et al, 1996;\nSwatman and Swatman, 1992) may simply reduce the level of benefits realised, this\nconstruct is explicitly recognised within the framework in order to identify the source of\nbarriers limiting the further development of e-trading and explore their impact. Barriers\n7may be internal to the firms, arise from the interaction between them or arise from the\nexternal environment.\nFigure 1: Proposed Framework\nAs described above, earlier studies have suggested that there are influences between\nIOS, IOR and the performance of e-trading (e.g. Cunningham and Tynan, 1993;\nFredriksson and Vilgon, 1996). However, unlike this research, no previous study has\nexplored these linkages at the level of individual constructs. Therefore this research\nshould provide more specific and actionable understanding of how the performance of\ne-trading between organisations can be improved and offer a means of addressing the\ncall to combine the economic and behavioural theories of exchanges between firms\n(Barringer and Harrison 2000; Dwyer et al. 1987).\nResearch Methodology\nExploration of the constructs identified in the research framework required investigation\nat various levels: technical, individual and organizational and the interactions between\nthese levels. It has been suggested for a full understanding of such complex\ninteractions, case studies are the most appropriate research method (Galliers and Land,\n1987; Benbasat et al. 1987). Such an approach is also consistent with the further\ndevelopment of existing theory (Yin, 2003). The case studies were compiled from\nretrospective interviews with a number of employees from both partners in each dyad\n(Kumar et al, 1993; Yin, 2003). Where possible the reliability of data given by\ninformants was triangulated with other sources such as company documents, annual\nreports, web-sites and press reports.\nFew extant studies have considered how the use of electronic linkages affects\nrelationships in established manufacturing industries and most of these have focussed\non a single relationship (Fredriksson and Vilgon, 1996, Choudhury et al, 1998; El Sawy\nPerformance\nSatisfaction\nExchange Climate\nExpectations\nVolume\nDiversity\nIntegration\nTrust\nBonds\nCoordination\nCooperation\nConflict\nBenefits\nBarriers\nE-Trading Use\n8et al, 1999) or predate the emergence of electronic markets (Barret and Konsynski,\n1982; Copeland and McKenney, 1988). Such industries are often characterised by both\nvery long term inter-organisational relationships and the use of a variety of inter-\norganisational systems platforms including more established electronic linkages, such as\nEDI, and newer forms, such as e-marketplaces. In particular, the paper industry\nprovided the potential for a pan-European set of case studies, which demonstrated a\nrange of well-established IOR and different types of IOS.\nThe leading Western European paper manufacturers and merchants were approached,\nwhich represented a sample of 20 firms. Of those that agreed to participate in the study,\ntheir customers or suppliers were then contacted to identify instances where dyadic\nrelationships could be studied. Initial telephone interviews were used to ascertain the\nnature of the e-trading relationships \u2013 for example, transaction volumes and diversity,\npercentage of the business transacted electronically \u2013 to ensure that evidence regarding\nthe main constructs could be collected. The six dyads chosen were those which\nrepresented sufficient variety of relationships and systems for the study and where both\nparties were willing to provide informed staff to be interviewed.\nEach dyad comprised a paper manufacturer and one of its major customers, paper\nmerchants. Table 1 shows basic information about the companies involved in the study\n(*Seller 2 sold to both Buyer 1 and Buyer 2, resulting in six distinct dyadic case\nstudies). The case study companies represent approximately 90% of the paper sold in\nWestern Europe.\nTable 1: Case Study Companies and Interviews Undertaken\nCompany Country Number of\nEmployees**\nTurnover\n(million)**\nInterview\nSite\nNo of\nInterviewees\nSeller 1 France 1,050 \u20ac 1,862.7 UK 4\n*Seller 2 Finland 6,611 \u20ac 10,000 Germany, France and UK 2\nSeller 3 Finland 19,636 \u20ac 4,651.4 UK 1\nSeller 4 Portugal 2,300 \u20ac 1,000 Portugal and UK 2\nSeller 5 South Africa 16,000 \u20ac 3,760 Belgium and UK 2\n*Buyer 1 France 1,100 \u20ac 2,457.7 UK 2\n*Buyer 2 Portugal 700 \u20ac 506 Germany and Portugal 3\nBuyer 3 Finland 2,554 \u20ac 1,392.6 UK 1\nBuyer 4 Netherlands 950 \u20ac 450 UK and Netherlands 3\nBuyer 5 Netherlands 330 \u20ac 353 UK and Netherlands 2\n(** figures confirmed by reference to annual reports and other published information)\nConsistent with other studies of IOR (Kumar et al. 1993), data was collected by means\nof interviews lasting between 1 and 2 hours with individual key informants. While\nseventeen interviews were in person at a company, five had to be conducted by\ntelephone. Interviewees were selected based on their involvement in and knowledge of\nthe business trading activities or the e-trading systems used or both. An interview guide\nwas developed from the research framework shown in Figure 1, and provided an\nexplicit sampling frame (Miles and Huberman, 1994) which facilitated comparison\nacross cases. All interviews were semi-structured and were recorded and transcribed\n9and, where necessary, translated into English. A number of follow up telephone calls\nwere made to confirm or clarify informants\u2019 views, particularly when facts presented by\ndyad informants differed. The software package QSR NVivo was employed to analyse\nthe interview transcripts (Bazeley, 2002; Crowley at al. 2002), with the research\nframework used to develop the coding structure. In all cases apart from one (Dyad #4,\nSeller 3 to Buyer 3) at least 4 people were interviewed. The trading relationships in\nDyad #4 are somewhat different from the others, being part of the same group and\nlinked by a VMI (Vendor Managed Inventory) agreement and traded via the Paperhub\nplatform. However, only one informant from each company was available to discuss the\ncompanies\u2019 trading arrangements and hence some richness of data was lost for some of\nthe constructs. Nevertheless the case represented a significant variant from the others\nand was considered important to the study. Details of the company relationships in each\ndyad, the IT platform used and the interviewees\u2019 roles are summarised in Appendix 1\nWithin-case analysis was undertaken, using the research framework shown in Figure1.\nThis was followed by cross-case analysis, also using the research framework, where\nsimilarities and differences between the IOR and IOS in the six cases were identified.\nCase Studies\nThe following section gives a brief summary of each of the six dyadic case studies. The\ncurrent technology platform used, its date of adoption and the information exchanged is\nsummarised in Table 2 and information about the constructs in the research framework\nis given in Table 3. Additional contextual information about each case is provided in\nAppendix 2.\nTable 2: Technology Platform, Year of Adoption and Information Exchanged\nDYAD # 1 2 3 4 5 6\nTechnology EDI PH EDI\nVMI on\nPH\nPH PH\nYear of Adoption 1986 2002 1986 2002 2004 2002\nOrder entry \uf02a \uf0d6 \uf02a \uf0d6 \uf0d6\nOrder status \uf0d6 w \uf0d6 \uf0d6\nOrder acknowledgement \uf02a \uf0d6 \uf02a \uf0d6 \uf0d6\nOrder history w w\nOrder amendments \uf0d6 \uf0d6 \uf0d6\nInvoice \uf02a \uf0d6 \uf02a \uf0d6 \uf0d6\nStock levels w \uf0b7 w \uf0b7 \uf0b7 \uf0b7\nDelivery notes \uf0d6 \uf02a \uf0b7 \uf0b7 \uf0d6\nProduction plan \uf0d6 w \uf0b7 \uf0d6\nDemand forecast \uf0b7 w \uf0b7 \uf0b7 \uf0b7 w\nSales plan\/Budget sales \uf0b7 \uf0b7 \uf0b7 \uf0b7\n10\nStock consumption \uf0d6\nSTANDARD MESSAGES (\uf02a or \uf0d6 only) 3 7 4 1 5 7\nTOTAL MESSAGING FORMATS 5 10 10 4 10 11\n\uf02a standard EDI message \uf0d6 standard PaperHub message\n\uf0b7 Excel file w secure web page\nPH = PaperHub\nDyad #1 (Seller 1 and Buyer 1)\nPerhaps surprisingly given the long history of e-trading, these firms demonstrate one of\nthe lowest levels of engagement with e-trading of the dyads studied. Although they\nhave high volumes of transactions between them, which led to the development of e-\ntrading, they have implemented only a few standard messages (n=3) (low diversity) and\nresort to manual input of some data and the exchange of Excel files (low integration).\nThe trust between the companies has been damaged, particularly at Board level, due to\nthe seller having broken the exclusivity deal with the buyer:\n'The relationship is probably not what it should be. As a company we tend not to get on,\nbecause they have their own objectives. It does get in the way when you get exclusive\narrangements taken off you and given to others, it does strain relationships' [Purchasing\nManager in Buyer 1].\nThe level of commitment to e-trading is also hampered by disagreement as to which IT\nplatform to use in the future. Both companies have only achieved a limited number of\noperational benefits, mainly associated with administrative efficiency improvements\nand cost savings, and reductions in stock holdings. However Seller 1 believed they had\ngained from e-trading:\n\u2018It\u2019s allowed us to restructure and to reduce cost\u2026people have been freed up and can\nmore proactive \u2013 chasing business and looking for new business\u2019 [Customer Services\nManager in Seller 1].\nDyad #2 (Seller 2 and Buyer 1)\nThese two firms show one of the highest levels of engagement with e-trading amongst\nthe case studies, due to their large volumes of transactions, number of standard message\ntypes developed (n=7) (high diversity) and their fully integrated systems and shared\ndatabases (high integration).\nThe firms exhibit high degrees of coordination, cooperation and commitment. This is\ndemonstrated by, for example, sharing of production planning and sales forecasting and\njoint haulage planning:\n\u2018Every month we do a forecast in our own forecast system. Buyer 1 is the only company\nto have access to our forecast\u2019 [Customer Services Manager in Seller 1]\n11\nThey have also undertaken joint business development initiatives arising as a result of\nadopting e-trading;\n'What the link did was freed up people to get to know each other. The result of that was\nthat we started something called the 'Joint Process Initiative' which is where we both go\nout and try and find business for each other.' [Customer Services Manager in Seller 2]\nThis extensive use of e-trading has resulted in significant strategic as well as operational\nbenefits. In addition to cost savings in administration and inventories, lead times have\nbeen reduced and both have seen increases in trading volumes. Both organizations view\ntheir investment in PaperHub as a demonstration of the commitment to e-trading with\neach other.\nDyad #3 (Seller 2 and Buyer 2)\nTogether with dyad #1, dyad #3 shows one of the lowest levels of engagement with e-\ntrading amongst the cases studied. Whilst the volume of transactions was sufficiently\nhigh to warrant the development of e-trading, the number of message types developed is\nlow (n=4) (low diversity) and integration is low due to limitations of Buyer 2\u2019s internal\nsystems. Future options are also limited due to the implementation of a new group-wide\nERP system, which will also reduce resources available for further e-trading\ndevelopment.\nUnderstandably, irrespective of the use of e-trading, the Exchange Climate is strongly\ninfluenced by the geographic location and proximity of the firms involved. Bonds and\ntrust have been established and continue due to local market presence, knowledge and\nparticular individuals:\n\u2018Purchasing decisions are made based on trust in people. And it\u2019s not just trust, it\u2019s\neven this local link. You tend to say that you centralise everything in Hamburg and you\ntrade from there \u2013 but we don\u2019t really, because this is a local [south German] business\u2019\n[General Manager in Buyer 2]\nThe use of e-trading has produced administrative efficiencies and inventory reductions\nfor both parties, but to date no strategic benefits. The level of commitment to e-trading\nis hampered by the inability of the buyer to invest further in e-trading development.\nDyad #4 (Seller 3 and Buyer 3)\nThe volume of trading in this dyad is very high, which led to the development of e-\ntrading, but the number of message types developed is low due to the VMI arrangement\nthese firms have in place. Whilst no manual input is required for data exchange, some\ndata is passed via Excel files (medium integration). Interestingly, whilst all other dyads\nshow a positive relationship between diversity and integration, due to the reduced\nnumber of messages used in VMI, this dyad is not consistent with that pattern,\nreinforcing the need to include both diversity and integration in the E-trading Use\nconstruct.\nThe Exchange Climate is characterised by the high level of dependence of the buyer\nsince the seller\u2019s products represent a significant proportion of its sales. The vendor\nmanaged inventory (VMI) arrangement between the firms further increases such\n12\ndependence, with the seller being responsible for replenishing the buyer\u2019s stock. As\nwith other dyads, personal contact at a sales desk level has reduced, but e-trading has\ncontributed to create multiple layers of contact across departments. Although there is a\nmutual commitment to achieving efficiency improvements from e-trading, the seller\nuses its power in the relationship to relegate the buyer to the role of the company\u2019s\ndistributor. As a result the seller has realised more benefits, mainly administrative and\ninventory savings, than the buyer and although both agree that operational benefits have\naccrued and relationships have become closer, strategic benefits have not yet been\nrealised.\n\u2018It\u2019s related to e-trading - there is deeper cooperation between the companies and it\nimproved the understanding of the processes\u2019 [Supply Chain & IT Manager \u2013 in Buyer\n3]\nDyad #5 (Seller 4 and Buyer 4)\nAs with the other dyads, the high volume of transactions justified the development of e-\ntrading. However, the number of standard message types developed (n=5) is more than\ndyads #1 and #3 but less than dyads #2 and #6. The level of integration also lies\nbetween these pairs of dyads; whilst no manual input of data exchanged is required,\nmanual approval for orders is still needed.\n\u2018We do not have shared databases, we only exchange messages\u2019 [e-Trading Project\nManager in Buyer 4]\nBoth companies financial investment in the PaperHub joint-venture and a sense of\nshared objectives has contributed to a high level of partner trust as well as increased the\ndependency on one another. This increased \u2018lock-in\u2019 is recognised by the seller:\n\u2018The intention of e-trading is to lock in the customer; naturally that\u2019s the intention\u2019\n[Production Planning Manager in Seller 4].\nCoordination has increased with the use of e-trading, particularly at an operational level,\nresulting in administrative cost savings and improved service lead times. Cooperation\nhas recently also included joint work on establishing PaperHub\u2019s technical standards.\nThe companies exhibit a growing commitment towards each other but so far have\nachieved mainly operational efficiency and cost saving benefits. However, potential\nstrategic benefits have been identified by refocusing the businesses from stock ordering\nto higher margin indent business and they expect this to yield increased profits for both\nparties in the future.\nDyad #6 (Seller 5 and Buyer 5)\nE-trading Use in this dyad is similar to that of dyad #2, in terms of volume, diversity\nand level of integration. In particular, in addition to fully integrated e-trading systems,\nthe firms share some applications for activities such as demand planning and\nforecasting. The sales plan from Buyer 5 is used by Seller 5 to automatically adjust\nstock levels and production plans without any manual intervention.\n13\nParticipating in the pilot implementation of the PaperHub e-marketplace and also\nworking subsequently to develop the standards and processes for this marketplace, has\nhelped these two firms to become much closer and develop inter-personal bonds and\ntrust;\n'Because we have had to sit down and talk about each other's processes we've got closer\ntogether, both personally and from a business point of view there is a better\nunderstanding of what each other's needs are'. [IT Implementation Manager in Buyer\n5].\nIn addition to cost reductions and cash flow improvements, both companies have also\nachieved strategic benefits from their e-trading, through both systems integration and\nredeploying the staff released to improve and extend customer services, which has\nincreased business volumes.\n\u2018I actually believe we\u2019ve gained substantial benefit. Not just us but the customer as well.\nWe started this endeavour and we will streamline and integrate ourselves more in the\nfuture\u2019 [Customer Services Manager in Seller 5].\n14\nTable 3: Summary of Constructs within Case Studies\nDimension\/Construct Dyad #1 Dyad #2 Dyad #3\nE-\nTR\nAD\nIN\nG\nUS\nE\nEXPECTATIONS initial focus on costs and administrative savings ability to cooperate more closely with partners in orderto achieve mutual strategic benefits mainly cost reduction focussed\nVOLUME high volume of business between firms in same groupled to development of e-trading high volumes led to development of e-trading\nhigh volume recognised as pre-condition to e-trading\ndevelopment\nDIVERSITY low -

Dyads #1 and #3 had rather simple expectations of cost savings from\nadministrative efficiencies, whereas dyads #2 and #6 had expectations of strategic\nbenefits and relationship improvements. Consistent with extant studies (Masseti and\nZmud, 1996; Iacovou et al. 1995), the data shown in Table 3 suggests a sufficient\nvolume of transactions and level of trust between partners appeared to be a pre-\ncondition to establishing the e-trading link. Diversity and integration therefore appear\nto be important in differentiating E-trading Use within the dyads, with dyads #1 and #3\nshowing the lowest use and dyads #2 and #6 the highest. Table 3 also suggests varying\nlevels of the Performance Satisfaction dimension across the dyads, particularly\naccording to the benefits realised. Consistent with their more limited expectations,\ndyads #1 and #3 have realised the least (purely operational benefits) and dyads #2 and\n#6, the most (both operational and strategic benefits). These differences suggest three\ngroupings of the dyads, which are discussed below.\nAs noted above, dyads #1 and #3 show the lowest level of E-trading Use and benefits\nrealised. Trust is also low, but for reasons outside the use of e-trading. In neither dyad\nhave further initiatives enabled by e-trading been pursued nor can agreement be reached\non whether or not to move to a new e-trading platform. Although these are the only two\ndyads still using EDI, funded largely by the sellers, it does not appear that the platform\nalone is preventing further development. Factors, such as strained relationships between\nthe firms and the resultant lack of trust in combination with the limited benefits\nachieved so far appear more important.\nIn contrast dyads #4 and #5 have achieved more benefits from e-trading than dyads #1\nand #3. In both dyads #4 and #5 there is significant integration of transactional\nmessages creating mutual dependence, enabled by the high levels of trust between the\ntrading partners. Both dyads use PaperHub, but both have reservations about the\ntransaction costs and its future. Dyad #5 has now seen opportunities for achieving more\nstrategic benefits, although few have been realised so far. However the mutual\nsatisfaction with the operational benefits has increased the commitment to develop the\ne-trading relationship further in the future.\nFinally, dyads #2 and #6 show the highest levels of use in terms of both standard\nmessages and additional information exchanged, which is highly integrated with the\nbuyer and seller systems in each dyad. They also report the highest level of overall\nbenefits achieved, including strategic benefits that have led to increased sales volumes.\nThe resulting increased mutual dependence has led to other collaborative initiatives and\na strong commitment to further investment in developing the partnerships. In the case of\ndyad #2 this is seen as a defence against further disintermediation in the industry.\nWhile the dyads trading via EDI have achieved lower levels of benefits than those\ntrading via PaperHub, the finding that there was a variation of benefits across the dyads\ntrading over this e-marketplace suggests that the platform adopted alone does not\nexplain the benefits achieved by the partners. Similarly, dyads with similar levels of\n17\nengagement with e-trading also show differing levels of benefits realised (dyads #4 and\n#5), suggesting that the effective use of e-trading within a relationship relies on\nattributes outside those included in the E-trading Use dimension of the research\nframework. As will be discussed in the following section, examination of the detailed\nattributes in the Exchange Climate and Performance Satisfaction dimensions suggest\nthat these play a determining role in increasing the use of e-trading between partners\nand explain why some organizations remain at a fairly basic use of e-trading, while\nothers progress further.\nSynthesised Findings\nThe following section uses the research framework to consider each of the three\ndifferent levels of E-trading Use and Performance Satisfaction observed in the case\nstudies, and how these affect and are affected by the Exchange Climate. In the\nconclusions to the paper we then consider how existing theories can explain why some\norganizations develop their e-trading relationships to achieve significant strategic\nbenefits, whereas others do not.\nOperational Development Phase\nThe basic or lowest level of e-trading is demonstrated by dyads #1 and #3. Consistent\nexpectations between partners and, as identified in earlier studies (e.g. Sabherwal and\nVijayasarathy, 1994), a significant volume of transactions and trust appear to be\nimportant antecedents to establishing e-trading. At this stage inter-organisational trust,\nrather than inter-personal trust is important. Expectations, volume and inter-\norganisational trust are therefore shown as preconditions to the establishment of an\nelectronic trading link in Figure 2.\nThe use of e-trading starts with basic transactional messages and limited inter-company\nintegration. This was found to reduce the need for human intervention, particularly at\nthe sales desk functions of the sellers and the purchasing or procurement functions of\nthe buyers, which results in reduced inter-personal contact at these levels. At the same\ntime, given the increased ability to coordinate activities, a number of previously\nseparate functions such as IT, logistics and dispatch are brought into closer contact.\nWith this use of the e-trading link, companies aim to achieve internal operational\nimprovements by streamlining the transactional aspects of their existing business\nrelationship. This first level we call the \u2018Operational Development\u2019 phase and it is\ndepicted in Figure 2. In our study, this phase is associated with traditional EDI links,\nwhich were typically initiated and financially supported by sellers. In this phase, the\nelectronic link contributes to improve the coordination of activities but has no influence\non the level of cooperation.\n18\nPerformance\nSatisfaction\nExchange Climate\nExpectations\nDiversity\nIntegration\nTrust\n(inter-personal)\nBonds\nCoordination\nCooperation\nConflict\nBenefits\nBarriers\nE-Trading Use\nPre-conditions\nVolume\nTrust\n(inter-organisational)\nContinue development of e-trading if\noperational benefits are achieved.

As time passes each partner engages in a sense-making\nprocess regarding the cause of any variance from target levels, creating a feedback loop\nacross the various dimensions of the framework. When deviations are observable and\nattributed to the partners\u2019 own actions, the feedback loop will be affected (Gallivan and\nDepledge, 2003). For example, the removal of an exclusivity deal between the trading\ncompanies in the case of dyad #1 influenced the feedback loop through an effect on\nbonds (at the board level) and trust. In the case of dyad #3, the focus of one trading\npartner on developing its own internal systems and lack of interest in investing in the e-\ntrading link also affected the feedback loop through the cooperation construct.\nOperational Cooperation Phase\nThrough the continuing use of e-trading, the feedback loop can start a virtuous cycle\n(Gallivan and Depledge, 2003) that enhances the Exchange Climate. The realisation of\neach company\u2019s internal operational benefits can lead trading partners to agree on a\nnumber of shared operational expectations about the electronic relationship, and to a\ndecision to share the investment required to further enhance their trading link. A number\nof the dyads (#2, #4, #5, #6) followed this route when a decision at each company\u2019s\nboard level was made to participate in the PaperHub joint-venture. This led to\n19\ncooperation at an operational level via the working groups responsible for setting the\nstandards to be used, and an increase in the diversity of messaging formats and levels of\nintegration between the companies. We term this increased level of e-trading the\n\u2018Operational Cooperation\u2019 phase. Figure 3 shows that the level of operational\ncooperation between the company\u2019s increases and the level of transactional conflicts\nreduce, when compared with the previous phase.\nPerformance\nSatisfaction\nExchange Climate\nDiversity\nIntegration\nTrust\n(inter-personal)\nBonds\nCoordination\nCooperation\nConflict\nBenefits\nBarriers\nE-Trading Use\nContinue development of e-trading if operational\nbenefits achieved and strategic benefits can be\nForeseen.

Within the individual\nmerchant, the responsible people in IT and in Supply Chain have each put together a\nteam, and the same thing happens at the mill and these teams get to know each other as\nthey work together.' [Supply Chain and IT Manager in Buyer 3].\nE-trading also helps to increase both trading partners\u2019 sense of objective sharing\n(Chatfield and Yetton, 2000). With this more favourable Exchange Climate, a closer\nmatch between each partners\u2019 achieved and expected benefits is established. However,\nthe continuity of the virtuous feedback loop can only be sustained if the constructs\nwithin the Exchange Climate support the increased level of cooperation and objective\nsharing. For example, companies in dyads #4 and #5 have increased the coordination of\nactivities between themselves, realising benefits from e-trading that have matched their\noperational level expectations. However, the virtuous cycle appears to remain stalled at\nOperational Cooperation for companies in dyad #4 as the seller is using the PaperHub\n20\ntrading link to accentuate its hierarchical power over the buyer, while in dyad #5 the\nseller is deferring further investment in use of the e-marketplace in order to improve its\nown internal IT systems.\nStrategic Alliance Phase\nDyads #2 and #6 illustrate how the virtuous cycle in the previous phase can be\ndeveloped further by the setting of joint strategic objectives. These objectives are\nconsistent with the original expectations of these dyads, which were focussed on the\nrealisation of strategic benefits and relationship improvement. These allow trading\npartners to move from a mechanism that achieves more efficient coordination and\ncooperation at an operational level, to a platform that enables and reinforces a sense of\nobjective sharing across various departments or groups within the organizations, further\nenhancing their Exchange Climate. At this level, trading partners mutually acknowledge\ntheir inter-dependency, increasingly cooperating on previously unrelated activities. We\nhave termed this the \u2018Strategic Alliance\u2019 phase.\nPerformance\nSatisfaction\nExchange Climate\nDiversity\nIntegration\nTrust\n(inter-personal)\nBonds\nCoordination\nCooperation\nConflict\nBenefits\nBarriers\nE-Trading Use\nContinue development of e-trading if strategic\nbenefits are achieved e.g. Dyad #2: development\nof Joint Business Development programme\nand sharing of strategic resources that lead\nto volume growth.

Savings due\nto e-trading were invested back into the same relationship, rather than to other\nrelationships or to all relationships, in order to improve it further. At this level conflicts\nand barriers are minimised and companies achieve a number of strategic benefits of e-\ntrading including realising growth in volumes of transactions and increased sales of\nhigher margin indent business.\n21\nIt is interesting to note that Seller 2 is in the \u2018Operational Development\u2019 phase in its\nrelationship with Buyer 2 (dyad #3), but in the \u2018Strategic Alliance\u2019 phase in dyad #2,\ntrading with Buyer 1. First, it shows that an organisation can, and probably will, be in a\nnumber of these e-trading relationships phases at the same time with different partners.\nIn this, case Seller 2 is trading via different platforms with the two buyers, but this does\nnot fully explain the significant differences in its relationships in the two dyads. It is the\nreluctance of Buyer 2 to invest further in e-trading, due to other IT priorities, that has\nstopped any further development. As discussed above, moving beyond the \u2018Operational\nDevelopment\u2019 phase requires shared investment in the technology, based on both parties\nexpectations of the additional benefits this will bring.\nConclusions\nThe study has sought to combine the rational perspective of e-trading drawn from IOS\nstudies and the relational and behavioural perspective drawn from IOR literature, by\ndeveloping a framework that combines elements from both and exploring its use in six\ntrading dyads in the European paper industry. Differences between the IOS and IOR\nobserved across the dyads can be explained, suggesting that the structure and content of\nthe framework are appropriate. Constructs from the IOS literature appear to explain the\ncommencement of e-trading, but constructs from the IOR literature are needed to\nexplain both changes in the trading relationship and the further development of the\nelectronic link.\nThe study findings show that closer strategic alignment (Allen et al. 2000), and hence\nthe achievement of strategic benefits in addition to simple operational benefits, is\ndependent on all three dimensions of the proposed framework. In addition to sufficient\nvolume, diversity and integration, joint strategic expectations are necessary, which in\nturn influence the Exchange Climate. As trust between partners using e-trading grows\nand uncertainty about the intentions and potential for opportunistic behaviour by the\nother party decreases, \u201cfirms and their members actively cooperate over time and assess\nthe resulting benefits, cooperative norms of behaviour set in and become\ninstitutionalized\u201d (Bensaou, 1997 p. 110). Performance satisfaction will be achieved if\nthe benefits realised match expectations. Given the successful use of e-trading, a\nvirtuous cycle is initiated enhancing the companies\u2019 sense of shared objectives, which\nbrings trading partners closer together, allowing them to pursue further joint activities\nand developments.\nWhile resources that have been freed up by e-trading can be invested in any or all\nrelationships, the evidence from this research (dyads #2 and #6) shows the investment\nof resources, both people and funds, back into the same relationship can be particularly\neffective. Those dyads that have reinvested such resources within the same relationship\nhave realised more strategic benefits than the others, including growth in sales volumes.\nHowever, the reinvestment of freed resources into those same relationships may also\nrepresent a form of lock-in between partners. This study has shown that well-\nperforming e-trading arrangements are relationship-specific due to the nature and role of\nthe Exchange Climate. With increased use of standards and open technologies, exit\n22\nbarriers to trading arrangements are therefore less likely to arise from the investment in\ntechnology rather they will be derived from the relationship itself.\nThis study considered dyads trading both via traditional EDI and via an e-marketplace.\nBoth of the firms that remained at the first level of trading identified, the Operational\nDevelopment phase were using EDI. However, the evidence from the cases suggests\nthat it is not the technology used in an e-marketplace that leads to improved e-trading\nand improved IOR. It is the process of jointly working together to develop the use of the\ntechnology and new trading processes that improves the Exchange Climate between the\nfirms:\n'With PaperHub you are building a solution together and dealing with problems as they\narise.

This study provides a means of\ncombining these theories to give a more complete understanding of e-trading.\nFigure 5: Combining Theoretical Bases\nEconomic efficiency arguments are at the basis of the initial establishment and\noperation of an e-trading link, represented by the Operational Development phase.\nTransactional Cost Economics\nAgency Theory\nResource Dependency\nTheory\nSocial Exchange\nTheory\nOPERATIONAL DEVELOPMENT\nOPERATIONAL COOPERATION\nSTRATEGIC ALLIANCE\nB\neh\nav\nio\nu\nra\nl\nE\nco\nn\no\nm\nic\nT\nH\nE\nO\nR\nE\nT\nIC\nA\nL\nP\nE\nR\nS\nP\nE\nC\nT\nIV\nE\nS\nR\nel\nat\nio\nn\nal\nT\nra\nns\nac\ntio\nn\nal\nE\nX\nC\nH\nA\nN\nG\nE\nT\nY\nP\nE\nS\n+\n+\nHigh volume of transactions make\nEstablishment of e-trading economically\nworthwhile.

Given information asymmetries (Knudsen, 1995), a company will be more\nwilling to establish e-trading with a partner with whom they have at least a basic level\nof knowledge and trust.\nBehavioural themes derived from Resource Dependency Theory (Pfeffer and Salancik,\n1978), explain the Operational Cooperation phase. Companies at this phase\nacknowledged that higher internal efficiencies could be achieved by coordinating with\ntheir trading partners to perform certain tasks, such as, in the case of dyad #4,\nmanagement of the buyer\u2019s inventory by the supplier.\nTo understand the Strategic Alliance phase additional themes from Social Exchange\nTheory are needed. This phase requires commitment and reciprocity between partners\n(Cropanzano and Mitchell, 2005). This is associated with relationships in which\nexchange actions are interdependent and contingent on rewarding reactions from others\nbeing the stimulus for further reaction (Blau, 1964). This continuous cycle of action\nand positive reaction (Kern and Willcocks, 2000) is the basis of the development of\nreciprocity in which a firm reacts to the needs of its partner as it would to its own\ninternal needs.\nThe lessons for practitioners from this study are that newer e-trading technologies, such\nas e-hubs are giving rise to new and important notions about e-trading use and its\ninfluences on buyer-seller relationships. Many companies have been reluctant to join e-\nmarketplaces due to the belief that allowing many-to-many links would result in price\ncomparisons and eroded trading relationships. This research has shown that, on the\ncontrary, companies should actively participate in such e-marketplaces, since these can\ncontribute to deepen and improve existing relationships. Managers need to acknowledge\nthat e-trading can be an important tool to enable and further develop inter-firm\nrelationships with key partners but they also need to realise that exit barriers to a trading\narrangement are derived from the relationship itself, due to the level of company\ninvolvement and interdependency, and not the result of investments in technology.\nIn mature industries using e-trading to develop existing relationships and focus on\npartners with high volume, instead of using technology to explore new trading partners,\nis an important lesson to practitioners. Efficiency benefits can be achieved from e-\ntrading in the short-term, but strategic benefits are dependent on the way e-trading is\nused to influence the companies\u2019 relationship. These can only be realised if the\nrelationship is sustained over time, and all parties continue to perceive the arrangement\nto be fair and beneficial.\nLimitations and Suggestions for Further Research\nThis study has focused on the paper industry, which is mature and highly consolidated,\nwith exit barriers derived from the large capital investment requirements; relationships\n24\nare well established and cannot be changed easily. These particular industry\ncharacteristics may reduce the ability to generalise the findings of this study. Further\nresearch in other industries would therefore be beneficial, either to confirm the findings\nof this study or to identify differences between industries.\nThe research design of this study does not allow the conclusion to be drawn that the\nthree phases of e-trading shown in Figures 2, 3 and 4 represent a learning or maturity\nmodel. Further studies, particularly those of a longitudinal design, are required to\ndetermine if firms can commence their engagement with e-trading at any of the phases\nidentified and if they can move between any of these phases.\nReferences\nAllen, D.K., Colligan, D., Finnie, A. and Kern, T.

Buyer 1 is\na worldwide distributor of paper\nand office consumables.\nAlthough both Seller 1 and\nBuyer 1 are owned by the same\nparent firm, the companies have\nbeen independent units for the\nlast two decades, each being\nresponsible for its own business.\nHowever, nearly 50% of Seller\n1\u2019s business is via Buyer 1.\nThey have been trading via EDI\nsince 1986, when the electronic\nlink was initiated by Seller 1,\nwith messages geared towards\nits interests of \u2018reducing\nadministrative costs in the\nsupply chain and integrating\noperations\u2019 (Supply Chain and\nIT Director in Seller 1).\nSeller 2 is one of the largest\npaper manufacturers in the\nworld, employing nearly 36,000\nstaff and has production sites in\n17 countries and over 170 sales\nand distribution companies.\nThe firms were trading for over\n10 years via EDI before moving\nto PaperHub, of which they\nwere founding members, since\n2002.\nThis case analysis is focused on\nthe companies\u2019 operations in\nGermany. Buyer 2 is among the\nbiggest paper distributors in the\nGerman market and is owned by\na major European paper\nmerchanting group. Although e-\ntrading is not well developed\nwithin the group, Buyer 2\nmaintains EDI relationships\nwith some manufacturers, of\nwhich Seller 2 is one of the\nmost important. The firms have\nbeen trading for 20 years and\nvia EDI since 1996, when it was\ninitiated by Seller 2:\n\u2018In the paper distribution\nbusiness priority is given to\nconverting the sales force from\nstreet selling to back office by\nconnecting to customers. Less\nimportance is placed on\nconnecting to suppliers\u2019\n[Deputy CEO in Buyer 2]\nDyad #4 (Seller 3 and\nBuyer 3)\nDyad #5 (Seller 4 and\nBuyer 4)\nDyad #6 (Seller 5 and\nBuyer 5)\nSeller 3 is one of Europe\u2019s\nlargest suppliers of printing,\noffice and magazine paper and\nconsumer packaging with 25\nproduction units in 9 countries,\nemploying over 19,000 people.\nBuyer 3 is owned by Seller 3\nand is one of the top 5 paper\nmerchants in Europe. Over 30%\nof Buyer 3 sales are of Seller 3\nproducts and, after trading via\nEDI since the mid 1980s they\nhave been using PaperHub since\n2002.\nSeller 4 is one of the largest\nEuropean producers of uncoated\npaper but compared with the\nother manufacturers studied it is\nrelatively small. Buyer 4 is part\nof the largest paper distributor\nin Europe with 20% market\nshare. Both firms are founder\nmembers of PaperHub through\nwhich they have been trading\nsince 2004.\nSeller 5 is one of the world's\nlargest producers of coated fine\npaper, which represents 81% of\nthe group sales. It has\nproduction facilities on three\ncontinents and employs over\n16,000 people. Buyer 5 is a\nleading paper merchant in the\nUK and is part of the same\nmerchanting group as Buyer 4.\nThe two firms have traded via\nEDI since the early 1990s and\nmoved to PaperHub in 2002.\n32\nAppendix 3\nA number of e-marketplaces emerged in the paper industry, such as PaperHub and\nForestExpress. For example, PaperHub was developed as a joint-venture of paper\nproducers and merchants, which can be understood as a consortium marketplace.\nPaperHub was intended as an electronic platform to which every participant in the paper\nindustry could join, with the aim of supporting systematic sourcing between companies.\nPaperHub was developed as a standardised platform based on the PapiNet standard\nmessages and intended for many-to-many type relationships.\nPapiNet is a strategic alliance formed between some of Europe\u2019s major paper producers,\nthe Confederation of European Paper Industries and the American Forest & Paper\nAssociation, among other important organisations. PapiNet standards were created as\nopen standards to facilitate the trading procedures in the paper industry and overcome\nsome of the limitations associated with EDI. As in other cases (Chatfield and Yetton,\n2000), although EDIPAP standards had been developed and employed in the paper\nindustry for a number of years, when establishing an EDI link to their partners\ncompanies simply automated existing information flows and decision processes,\nmaintaining their internal processes. As a consequence, in many cases a company had to\nmanually change product codes when trading electronically with two different partners.\nThis resulted in important limitations to trading with multiple partners through e-\nmarketplaces.\nA variety of services was offered by PaperHub, from product catalogue, to product code\ntranslation and supply-chain visibility. The product translation functionality was created\nto enable the match between the unique product attribute of one company with the\nproduct attribute values of its various trading partners, finding the corresponding\nproduct based on each company\u2019s individual descriptions. Thus, the product translation\nfunctionality allows companies to trade with multiple partners without any manual\nintervention (see Figure A3.1).\n33\nFigure A3.1: Product\ntranslation\nXML\nMessage\nXML\nMessage\n"}
