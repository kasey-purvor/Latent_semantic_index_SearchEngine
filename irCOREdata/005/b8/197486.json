Introduction\nIn its classical form, the liquidity trap, a term coined by Keynes (1936), is a situation\nwhere an economy is caught up in a de\u0087ation and the nominal interest rate has been\ndriven down to zero (the so called \u0091zero lower bound\u0092). The source of a liquidity trap,\nin most circumstances, is a sharp fall in aggregate demand; see Keynes (1936), Bernanke\n(2002).\nInterest in the liquidity trap has revived in recent years due, in no small measure, to\nthe experience of Japan since 1990. Woodford (2005, p.29) discusses the near miss of the\nUS economy from a liquidity trap in the summer of 2003. The era of successful delegation\nof monetary policy to independent central banks with low in\u0087ation targets opens up the\npossibility that su\u00a2 ciently large negative demand shocks might push an economy into a\nliquidity trap with huge associated welfare consequences. Recent policy discussions on\neither side of the Atlantic have expressed concerns about the nominal interest rate hitting\nthe zero lower bound.1\nIn a liquidity trap, traditional monetary policy loses its e\u00a4ectiveness because nominal\ninterest rates can be reduced no further in order to boost the interest sensitive components\nof aggregate demand. Hence, reliance must be placed on other, possibly more expensive,\npolicies. Keynes (1936), in the \u0085rst policy prescription for a liquidity trap, suggested\nthe use of \u0085scal policy, which works through the multiplier e\u00a4ect to boost output and\nemployment.\n1.1. The modern literature on the liquidity trap\nThe recent literature has largely focussed on the role of in\u0087ation expectations in a liquidity\ntrap. To see this, note that the real interest rate, r, is given by r = i\u0000 \u0019e, where i is the\nnominal interest rate and \u0019e is expected in\u0087ation. In a liquidity trap, by de\u0085nition, i = 0,\nand due to de\u0087ationary expectations, typically \u0019e < 0, hence, r > 0. To expand economic\nactivity, the government needs to lower r.\nOne possible solution, suggested by Krugman (1998, 1999), is to generate positive\nin\u0087ationary expectations, \u0019e > 0, so that the real interest rate r < 0. This, in turn,\ncreates a need for a credible commitment to the future level of actual in\u0087ation because\n1In an article on Bloomberg.com on 6 July 2009, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President,\nJanet Yellen, is reported to have told reporters after a speech in San Francisco: \u0093We have a very serious\nrecession, we have a 9.4 percent unemployment rate... Given the recession\u0092s severity, we should want to do\nmore. If we were not at zero, we would be lowering the funds rate.\u0094The Economist wrote on November\n13, 2008 that: \u0093Remember Japan\u0092s zero interest rates? America is almost there too. Since October 29th,\n...the \u0093e\u00a4ective rate\u0094, has averaged around 0.25%...\u0094The Telegraph, a national daily in Britain reported\nin January 2009 that the interest rate has been cut to it\u0092s lowest level in the last 300 years to 1.5% and\nwent on to say that: \u0093Further cuts are expected in the next few months and the base rate may be reduced\nto zero this year.\u0094\n1\nafter the economy has escaped from the liquidity trap it is in the interest of all parties\nto reduce in\u0087ation. A forward looking private sector will anticipate this and expect low\nfuture in\u0087ation. But then the real interest rate remains high, keeping the economy in\na liquidity trap. The era of low in\u0087ation targets exacerbates the problem, because such\ntargets lead to low values of \u0019e and, so, the real interest cannot be reduced low enough to\nboost recovery in a liquidity trap.\nThe literature on the liquidity trap has considered a range of solutions, e.g., exchange\nrate policies such as currency depreciation, integral stabilization, a carry tax on currency,\nopen market operations in long term bonds, price level targets, and money growth rate\npegs. The surveys in Svensson (2003) and Blinder (2000) consider these policies in detail.\nHowever, these policies have important limitations2 ;3. Eggertsson (2006a, 2006b) recom-\nmends abandonment of an independent central bank and a return to discretionary policy\nby a unitary monetary-\u0085scal authority. A debt \u0085nanced \u0085scal expansion during a liquidity\ntrap results, via the government budget constraint, in higher expectations of future in\u0087a-\ntion. Eggertsson shows that this solution is superior to either monetary policy alone or\nuncoordinated monetary and \u0085scal policy. However, as Eggertsson shows, even optimal\ndiscretion is inferior to the fully optimal rational expectations solution with commitment.\nMoreover, abandoning delegation of monetary policy to an independent central bank with\na narrow mandate, in favor of a return to discretion, appears to be a retrograde step.4\n1.2. Some relevant questions to ask in modeling a liquidity trap\nWhat kind of questions should economists ask when they wish to model a liquidity trap?\nPerhaps it would be useful to be guided by the recent Japanese experience. Based on\n2Variants of the devaluation approach can be found in McCallum (2000) and Svensson (2003). There are\nseveral potential problems with the devaluation option. First, calibrated models show that the magnitude\nof the devaluation required to get out of the liquidity trap might be too high. Second, using the uncovered\ninterest rate parity condition, when the domestic interest rate is zero, the expected appreciation of the home\ncurrency is fully locked-in by the foreign interest rate. Third, current devaluation will generate expectations\nof future appreciation of currency when the economy moves out of the liquidity trap, generating counter\n\u0087ows that frustrate attempts to devalue. Fourth, devaluations may bring about competitive devaluations\nor retaliations in the form of other barriers to trade.\n3In a liquidity trap, zero nominal interest rates make bonds and money perfect substitutes. Hence, it\nmight be di\u00a2 cult to engineer a price level increase. Furthermore, increases in money supply, suggested,\nfor instance, in Clouse et al. (2003) and in Orphanides and Wieland (2000), for a long enough period\nthat exceeds the duration of the liquidity trap, creates problems of credibility. While short term interest\nrates might be zero, long term interest rates might be strictly positive (this has been true of Japan during\nits de\u0087ationary experience). Hence, several authors such as Bernanke (2002) and Auerbach and Obstfeld\n(2005) have suggested open market operations in long term bonds. However, moving the long run yield\ncurve on securities is confounded by the presence of the risk premium term whose behavior in a liquidity\ntrap is not well known. A carry tax on money, suggested by Buiter and Panigirtzoglu (2003), works in\ntheory but substantial practical problems of implementation are likely.\n4Central bank independence has other bene\u0085ts. For example, it shields monetary policy from political\ninterference and allows the delegation of policy to the most competent experts etc.\n2\nseveral recent works on the Japanese experience5 we cull out the following three stylized\nfacts, S1-S3, about the Japanese experience which, we believe, must be respected, at the\nminimum, by any model of a liquidity trap that makes economic policy prescriptions.6\nS1. Fiscal policy is potent in a liquidity trap: Whenever the net \u0085scal stance was ex-\npansionary, it worked well and the de\u0085cit spending multipliers were signi\u0085cant, and\nlarge. However, the net \u0085scal stance was typically contractionary or neutral.7\nS2. The response to a liquidity trap is inadequate if the Treasury or the Central Banks are\nnot given appropriate targets: There were no explicit in\u0087ation or output targets given\nto either the Treasury or to the Central Bank. So, the \u0085scal stance was typically\ncontractionary, or neutral, and the monetary policy reaction was too little, too late.\nS3. Lack of coordination between the Treasury and the Central Bank hampers policy re-\nsponse in a liquidity trap: The Treasury and the Central Bank may disagree about\nan appropriate response and also di\u00a4er about their respective spheres of responsibil-\nity, if not well de\u0085ned. They might end up taking policy actions that are counter to\neach other or cancel each other out and so, on net, are not expansionary.8\nFurthermore, models of a liquidity trap must make the following modelling choices,\nM1-M2.\nM1. Models belong to either one of two categories. In the \u0085rst category are models with\nan ex-ante perspective that recognize the possibility of a liquidity trap in the fu-\nture. The focus of such models is on the optimal design of institutions in order to\nreduce\/eliminate the consequences arising from a liquidity trap. In the second cate-\ngory are models with an ex-post perspective that propose policy solutions, conditional\non an economy having already slipped into a liquidity trap.\nM2. Economics recommends aiming for an optimal level of \u0091economic bads\u0092(e.g., exter-\nnalities), rather than their complete elimination. Clearly, the optimal policy must\nbalance the marginal cost of removal of the economic bads against the marginal ben-\ne\u0085ts. In the context of a liquidity trap, the optimal policy recommendation might,\ntherefore, turn out to be one that lets the economy fall into a liquidity trap with some\nprobability rather than completely eliminating the possibility of a liquidity trap.9\n5See, for instance, Posen (1998), Kuttner and Posen (2001), Iwamura et al. (2005) and Ball (2005).\n6See the working paper version of the paper, Dhami and al-Nowaihi (2007), for the details.\n7See, for instance, Posen (1998), Kuttner and Posen (2001) and Eggertsson (2006b).\n8See, for instance, the empirical evidence in Iwamura et al (2005) and Eggertsson (2006b).\n9A dental analogy might be appropriate here. Tooth decay can be prevented by extracting all the\nchild\u0092s teeth. But, normally, the optimal policy is not to extract; tooth decay then occurs with some\nprobability.\n3\n1.3. Our approach to modeling a liquidity trap\nOur model of a liquidity trap takes explicit account of all the three stylized facts, S1, S2,\nS3. We consider strategic interaction between monetary and \u0085scal authorities in a simple\naggregate supply - aggregate demand model similar to the one in Dixit and Lambertini\n(2003) and Lambertini and Rovelli (2003) but extended to allow for a liquidity trap and\nthe e\u00a4ect of in\u0087ationary expectations in the aggregate supply curve. Our perspective is\nex-ante, i.e., we focus on the design of institutions, namely, the appropriate incentives for\nthe Treasury and the Central Bank, prior to the occurrence of a liquidity trap (M1). In\nour model, we \u0085nd it optimal to allow the economy to fall into a liquidity trap with some\nprobability (M2).\nIssues of strategic policy interaction between monetary and \u0085scal authorities are com-\npletely ignored by the theoretical work on the liquidity trap. Typically, the only policy\nconsidered is monetary policy and so issues of strategic interaction do not arise10. On the\nother hand, when several policies are simultaneously considered, their strategic interaction\nis not allowed for.11 One strand of the literature considers policies that could mitigate\nthe e\u00a4ects of liquidity traps. The other strand prescribes policies that would prevent the\neconomy from ever falling into a liquidity trap.12 Some papers in the literature take an\nex-ante perspective, while others take an ex-post perspective.13.\n1.4. Some results and intuition\nAs pointed out above, Krugman identi\u0085ed the solution to a liquidity trap as creating high\nenough in\u0087ationary expectations. However, under discretion, promises of high in\u0087ation\nwill not be believed. This is because, outside a liquidity trap, the correct value for the real\ninterest rate can be achieved more cheaply with zero in\u0087ation. Therefore, if the economy\nturns out not to be liquidity trapped, the Treasury has an incentive to renege on its promise\n10Examples are Krugman (1998), Eggerston and Woodford (2003), Nishiyama (2003), Clouse et al.\n(2003), Buiter- Panigirtzoglou (2003), and Auerbach and Obstfeld (2005). Ball (2005) considers \u0085scal\npolicy alone.\n11Examples include (1) monetary and \u0085scal policy in Benhabib, Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2002), Iwa-\nmura et al. (2005), and (2) monetary and exchange rate policy in Orphanides and Wieland (2000),\nMcCallum (2000) and Svensson (2003). Bernanke (2002) considers both monetary and \u0085scal policy but\nthere is no theoretical analysis.\n12In the \u0085rst group are Krugman (1998), Eggertsson and Woodford (2003), Orphanides and Wieland\n(2000), McCallum (2000), and Svensson (2003). In the second group are Benhabib, Schmitt-Grohe and\nUribe (2002), Nishiyama (2003), Clouse et al. (2003), Buiter- Panigirtzoglou (2003), and Auerbach and\nObstfeld (2005).\n13In the \u0085rst group are Krugman (1998), Eggertsson and Woodford (2003), Benhabib, Schmitt-Grohe\nand Uribe (2002), Shin-Ichi (2003), Clouse et al. (2003), Buiter- Panigirtzoglou (2003). In the second\ngroup are papers by Ball (2005), Auerbach and Obstfeld (2005). Finally there are papers that touch\non both ex-ante and ex-post issues, for instance, Orphanides and Wieland (2000), McCallum (2000),\nBernanke (2002), Svensson (2003).\n4\nof high in\u0087ation. A rational forward looking private sector will anticipate this. The result\nis low in\u0087ation expectations, keeping the real interest rate too high in a liquidity trap.\nNotice that unlike the standard analysis conducted in the absence of a liquidity trap, the\ndiscretionary outcome can be suboptimal relative to the precommitment outcome because\nit creates too little in\u0087ation (Eggertsson (2006a,b) calls this the de\u0087ation bias).\nWe suggest an institutional solution, the optimal delegation regime, that achieves the\noptimal rational expectations precommitment solution for all parameter values in our\nmodel. This regime has three components. First, the Treasury acts as the Stackelberg\nleader and the Central Bank as the follower. Second, an in\u0087ation target is given to a Central\nBank who has exclusive control over monetary policy. Outside a liquidity trap, where\nmonetary policy is e\u00a4ective, the Treasury would rather not use the relatively more costly\n\u0085scal stabilization policy, leaving the Central Bank to perform the stabilization function.\nBecause the Central Bank is operationally independent and its sole objective is achieving\nmonetary stability, this type of delegation provides a commitment to the necessary in\u0087ation\nlevel when the economy is not in a liquidity trap. Our third component is to give the\nTreasury, who retains control of \u0085scal policy, something like a Taylor rule, which penalizes\ndeviations of output from an output target and in\u0087ation from an in\u0087ation target. This\ngives the Treasury the correct incentive to undertake the appropriate (but costly) \u0085scal\nstimulus in a liquidity trap where monetary policy is ine\u00a4ective. Consequently, in\u0087ation\nexpectations are at the right level to produce the correct value for the real interest rate in\na liquidity trap.\nFurthermore, the optimal delegation regime achieves the optimal mix between monetary\nand \u0085scal policy as we now explain. Theoretically, society could give a su\u00a2 ciently high\nin\u0087ation target to the Central Bank which in turn generates su\u00a2 ciently high in\u0087ation\nexpectations so that the nominal interest rate never hits its zero \u0087oor (see modelling\nchoice M2, above). While this policy would always avoid the liquidity trap, it is not\noptimal because in\u0087ation is costly. Analogously, it is not optimal to give the Treasury\ntoo high an output target because if a liquidity trap occurs, it would use the costly \u0085scal\npolicy excessively. The optimal solution then is to have a mix of both, i.e., some in\u0087ation\noutside a liquidity trap and some dependence on \u0085scal policy in a liquidity trap.\nThe \u0085rst best is achieved if one could remove the distortions that cause the liquidity\ntrap. The second best obtains with the optimal rational expectations commitment solution.\nThe third best is achieved with various institutional design features introduced into policy\nmaking. The fourth best obtains under discretion.14 It is well known that, in the absence\nof a liquidity trap, \u0091optimal institution design\u0092, such as Walsh contracts, can achieve the\nsecond best.15 Our suggested institutional design achieves the second best in the presence\n14See, for example, Rogo\u00a4 (1985).\n15See Walsh (1995) and al-Nowaihi and Levine (1996).\n5\nof a liquidity trap; see section 4, below.\n1.5. Schematic outline\nThe model is formulated in Section 2. Section 3 derives the two benchmark solutions:\nthe optimal rational expectations precommitment solution and the discretionary solution.\nSection 4 derives the optimal delegation solution. Section 5 concludes. Proofs can be found\nin the appendix.\n2. Model\nWe describe the most parsimonious version of the model in this paper. At substantial costs\nin terms of complexity, and much reduced pedagogical clarity, the model can be shown\nto be robust with respect to the following extensions.16 The full set of parameters in\nthe aggregate demand and supply curves, persistent demand shocks, a general probability\ndistribution over the two states of nature, and further considerations about the Treasury\u0092s\nobjectives.\n2.1. Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply\nWe use an aggregate demand and supply framework that is similar to recent work on\nstrategic monetary-\u0085scal policy interaction, e.g., Ball (2005), Dixit and Lambertini (2003)\nand Lambertini and Rovelli (2003). The aggregate demand and supply equations are given\nby, respectively17\nAD : y = f \u0000 (i\u0000 \u0019e) + \u000f. (2.1)\nAS : y = \u0019 \u0000 \u0019e, (2.2)\nwhere y is the deviation of output from its natural rate and f captures \u0085scal policy18. For\nexample, f > 0 could denote a \u0085scal de\u0085cit (either debt \u0085nanced or money \u0085nanced19)\nwhile f < 0, denotes a \u0085scal surplus. But f could also denote a temporary balanced\n16See the working paper version, Dhami and al-Nowaihi (2007), for a full proof of these claims. Some\nof the expressions run into more than a page and so are not convenient to print.\n17Extension to a full set of parameters for the AS and AD curves is possible at substantial increase in\ncomplexity; see Dhami and al-Nowaihi (2007).\n18To be more precise, f is the stabilization component of \u0085scal policy (which varies over the business\ncycle). Total \u0085scal policy can be represented by F = f0+f , where f0 denotes the \u0085xed \u0085scal commitments\nof the government.\n19In principal, these alternative modes of \u0085nance need not be equivalent. However, in the context of\na liquidity trap, Ball (2005) shows that there are no long run di\u00a4erences arising from these alternative\nmodes of \u0085nance.\n6\nbudget reallocation of taxes and subsidies that has a net expansionary e\u00a4ect; for instance\nDixit and Lambertini (2000). i \u0015 0 is the nominal interest rate, \u0019 is the rate of in\u0087ation,\n\u0019e is expected in\u0087ation and, in keeping with the modern literature on the liquidity trap, \u000f\nis a demand shock20. We assume rational expectations on behalf of the public. So, if x is\na random variable and E(x) is its mathematical expectation, then the expectation, xe, of\nx formed by a decision maker is\nxe = E (x) . (2.3)\nThe instruments of policy are the nominal interest rate, i, and the stabilization component\nof \u0085scal policy, f .\nFor simplicity, let the demand shock, \u000f, be independently distributed and take only\ntwo values, a;\u0000a, with equal probability, where a > 0, hence21\nE (\u000f) = 0, V ar (\u000f) = a2. (2.4)\nThe aggregate demand equation re\u0087ects the fact that demand is increasing in the \u0085scal\nimpulse, f , and decreasing in the real interest rate, r = i\u0000\u0019e. Demand is also a\u00a4ected by\ndemand shocks. The aggregate supply equation shows that deviations of output from the\nnatural rate are caused by unexpected movements in the rate of in\u0087ation.\nEquating aggregate demand and supply we get from (2.1) and (2.2), our reduced form\nequations for output and in\u0087ation.\ny = f \u0000 i+ \u0019e + \u000f. (2.5)\n\u0019 = f \u0000 i+ 2\u0019e + \u000f. (2.6)\nHence, \u0085scal policy, monetary policy and in\u0087ation expectations (in the spirit of New Key-\nnesian models) have an a\u00a4ect on output (and so also on unemployment) and in\u0087ation.22\n2.2. Notation and the rational expectations condition\nWe shall write a variable with a subscript (sometimes a superscript) \u0091H\u0092, for example, yH\nand UHT , to denote the realization of these variables in the good (or high) state of the\n20Our framework can be easily extended to incorporate supply, as well as demand, shocks.\n21The results do not depend on the demand shock taking only two possible values, although it allows\nfor a particularly clear exposition. The results hold for a general probability distribution over demand\nshocks that, furthermore, exhibit persistence, see Dhami and al-Nowaihi (2007)\n22The analogy with New Keynesian models is quite strong. There are no structural dynamics in our\nmodel. Hence, if policy rules are also stationary (as they will be in our model), then \u0019et = \u0019\ne\nt+1. The\nAS-curve (2.2) can then be written as yt = \u0019t \u0000 \u0019et+1, i.e., the expected change in the in\u0087ation rate is\nrelated to the output gap, as in the New Keynesian Phillips curve. Similarly, the AD-curve (2.1) can\nbe written in a form reminiscent of the New Keynesian IS-curve. We are grateful to Referee 2 for these\nobservations.\n7\nworld, \u000f = a. Analogously, to denote the realization of the same variables in the bad (or\nlow) state of the world, \u000f = \u0000a, we use a subscript (sometimes a superscript) \u0091L\u0092, for\nexample, yL and ULT . Since the states \u000f = a and \u000f = \u0000a occur with equal probability,\nthe average or expected value of any stochastic variable, x, is E (x) = 1\n2\nxL +\n1\n2\nxH . The\nrational expectations assumption (2.3) becomes xe = 1\n2\nxL +\n1\n2\nxH . In particular,\n\u0019e =\n1\n2\n\u0019L +\n1\n2\n\u0019H . (2.7)\nFrom (2.6) we get \u0019L = fL \u0000 iL + 2\u0019e \u0000 a and \u0019H = fH \u0000 iH + 2\u0019e + a. Substituting into\n(2.7) gives \u0019e = 1\n2\n(fH + fL)\u0000 12 (iH + iL) + 2\u0019e and, hence,\n\u0019e =\n1\n2\n(iH + iL)\u0000 1\n2\n(fH + fL) . (2.8)\n2.3. Microfoundations\nOur model is inspired by the microfounded dynamic model of monopolistic competition and\nstaggered price setting in Dixit and Lambertini (2000, 2003). Our structural model in (2.1),\n(2.2) (or its variant with the full set of parameters in Dhami and al-Nowaihi, 2007) is similar\nto the Dixit and Lambertini model.23 In the Dixit and Lambertini framework, unexpected\nmovements in in\u0087ation have real e\u00a4ects because prices are staggered. Alternatively, a\nrange of \u0091rational inattention\u0092theories currently compete as potential explanations for the\npresence of the unexpected in\u0087ation term in (2.2). For instance, see Sims (2003).24\nTo simplify the dynamic game-theoretic analysis Dixit-Lambertini follow the tradition,\nestablished in the time-inconsistency literature25, of abstracting from structural dynamic\nissues, notably, capital formation, the term structure of interest rates, exchange rate pol-\nicy and the \u0085nancing of the stabilization component of \u0085scal policy. Concentrating on\nthe aggregate demand consequences of investment expenditure, but abstracting from its\n23However, our model has the following di\u00a4erences from the Dixit-Lambertini model. (1) If the natural\nrate of output is normalized to zero, then, the additive shock \u000f (in (2.1) or in (2.5)) can also be interpreted\nas a shock to the natural rate of output. (2) Our model has the New Keynesian feature that expected\nin\u0087ation, \u0019e, also a\u00a4ects actual in\u0087ation, \u0019. (3) Our stochastic structure allows persistence (see Dhami\nand al-Nowaihi, 2007). While there is no persistence in Dixit-Lambertini, they allow all parameters to\nbe stochastic, hence, considering the possibility of non-additive shocks. (4) In our model, a \u0085scal impulse\nacts on the demand side, creating greater output and in\u0087ation. However, in the Dixit-Lambertini model,\n\u0085scal policy works on the supply side and takes the form of a subsidy to imperfectly competitive \u0085rms\nthat increases output but reduces prices.\n24Most dynamic structural models used in the analysis of a liquidity trap are forward looking New\nKeynesian models. Gertler (2003), Mankiw (2002) note dissatisfaction with this model in terms of its\ninability to explain persistence in the data. Recent work, for instance, Rudd and Whelan (2006), casts\ndoubt even on the hybrid variant proposed by Gali and Gertler (1999). Of course, similar criticisms apply\nto the version of our model microfounded along the lines of Dixit and Lambertini (2003). Thus, all current\nmacroeconomic models lack satisfactory microfoundations.\n25See, for example, Romer (2006, chapter 10) and Walsh (2003, chapter 8).\n8\ncontribution to growth, is standard in models of the business cycle, and is, as far as we\nknow, a feature of all existing models of the liquidity trap.\nEggertsson and Woodford (2003), in a structurally dynamic model of monetary policy\nwith a \u0085nancial sector and a zero lower bound on interest rates, show that the short-run\ninterest rate (which is the instrument of policy) determines all other interest rates and\nexchange rates. As they clearly explain, open market operations only work to the extent\nthat they enhance the credibility of policy. Thus, and in common with many models, we\ntake the short-run interest rate as directly a\u00a4ecting aggregate demand and we abstract\nfrom open economy aspects.\nWe o\u00a4er two arguments that mitigate not explicitly modelling the government budget\nconstraint. First, we shall assign a higher welfare loss to the use of \u0085scal policy relative to\nmonetary policy. The cost of using \u0085scal policy could include deadweight losses, costs of\nservicing debt and a risk premium for default. Second, in all equilibria of our model, \u0085scal\npolicy is not used for stabilization purposes outside a liquidity trap. In a calibrated model\nof Japan, Ball (2005) shows that the combination of higher output, higher tax revenues\nand higher in\u0087ation outside the liquidity trap is more than adequate to \u0085nance the extra\n\u0085scal spending during the liquidity trap. See subsection 4.3, below, for further discussion\nof this issue.\n2.4. Social Preferences\nSociety\u0092s preferences over output and in\u0087ation are given by the social welfare function,\nUS = \u00001\n2\n(y \u0000 y)2 \u0000 1\n2\n\u00192 \u0000 f 2. (2.9)\nThe \u0085rst term shows that departures of output from its desired level, y (note that y is\nthe di\u00a4erence between desired output and the natural rate), are costly. We assume that\ny \u0015 0. (2.10)\nThis captures the fact that the natural level of output is socially suboptimal (unless\ny = 0)26.\nThe second term in (2.9) makes the standard assumption that in\u0087ation reduces social\nwelfare. The third term captures the fact that the exercise of \u0085scal policy is more costly\n26The microfoundations for this in Dixit and Lambertini (2000, 2003) rest on the presence of monopolistic\ncompetition. Monopoly power in the product market reduces output below the e\u00a2 cient level, hence, giving\npolicy makers an incentive to raise output. There are also a large number of other well known reasons\nfor (2.10) but the ultimate cause, argue Alesina and Tabellini (1987), is the absence of non-distortionary\ntaxes. For if they were available then other market failures could be corrected.\n9\nthan that of monetary policy27. We model this as imposing a strictly positive cost of \u0085scal\npolicy, f 2, but no cost of using the monetary policy28. The cost of using \u0085scal policy could\ninclude deadweight losses, as in Dixit and Lambertini (2003), costs of servicing debt and\na risk premium for default.29\nFrom (2.9), we see that the \u0085rst best obtains when \u0019 = 0, f = 0, and y = y. However,\nfrom (2.1) and (2.2), it follows that this cannot be an outcome of a rational expectations\nequilibrium (unless y = 0). On the microfoundations of the social welfare function, in\n(2.9), see Dixit and Lambertini (2000, 2003), Rotemberg and Woodford (1999).\nSubstituting (2.5) and (2.6) into (2.9), we get\nUS = \u00001\n2\n(f \u0000 i+ \u0019e + \u000f\u0000 y)2 \u0000 1\n2\n(f \u0000 i+ 2\u0019e + \u000f)2 \u0000 f 2. (2.11)\nIn the light of subsection 2.2, and using (2.11), the expected social welfare is\nE (US) =\n1\n2\n\u0014\n\u00001\n2\n(fH \u0000 iH + \u0019e + a\u0000 y)2 \u0000 1\n2\n(fH \u0000 iH + 2\u0019e + a)2 \u0000 f 2H\n\u0015\n+\n1\n2\n\u0014\n\u00001\n2\n(fL \u0000 iL + \u0019e \u0000 a\u0000 y)2 \u0000 1\n2\n(fL \u0000 iL + 2\u0019e \u0000 a)2 \u0000 f 2L\n\u0015\n.

(2.13)\n2.5. Sequence of Moves\nIn the \u0085rst stage, the economy designs its institutions, which assign to one or two inde-\npendent policy makers (i.e., the Treasury and the Central Bank) their respective domains\nof decision making. This is followed by the formation of in\u0087ationary expectations, \u0019e, and\nthe signing of nominal wage contracts in anticipation of future in\u0087ation. Next, the demand\nshock, \u000f, is realized. Conditional on the actual realization of the shock, the relevant policy\nmakers then decide on the optimal values of the policy variables, f and i.\n27Fiscal policy is typically more cumbersome to alter, on account of the cost of changing it (balanced\nbudget requirements, lobby groups etc.). Indeed the \u0091monetary policy committee\u0092in the UK or the \u0091Fed\u0092\nin the USA meet on a regular basis to make decisions on the interest rate while changes to the tax rates\nare much less frequent.\n28Strictly speaking, for our qualitative results to hold, we only require that \u0085scal policy be relatively\nmore expensive than the (possibly strictly positive) cost of using monetary policy. Normalizing the cost\nof using monetary policy to zero, however, ensures greater tractability and transparency of the results.\n29See Eser et al. (2009) for a microfounded discussion of why \u0085scal policy is a relatively more costly\nstabilization instrument.\n10\nWe shall also derive the optimal rational expectations solution (precommitment bench-\nmark) in which the last stage is conducted up-front, i.e., the (state contingent) policy\nvariables f and i are announced to the economy prior to the resolution of demand uncer-\ntainty.\n3. The Precommitment and Discretionary Solutions\nWe \u0085rst calculate the globally optimal solution in the class of all rational expectations\nsolutions in subsection 3.130. Strictly speaking, this is a second best solution. The \u0085rst\nbest obtains if the imperfections responsible for the liquidity trap are removed. But because\nit is only second best, there is \u0091room for improvement\u0092. Speci\u0085cally, once the public has\nformed its expectations of in\u0087ation, the government has the incentive to launch a \u0091surprise\nin\u0087ation\u0092or, in the case of a liquidity trap, a \u0091surprise de\u0087ation\u0092, that is potentially welfare\nimproving. This destroys the credibility of the optimal solution in the eyes of a rational\npublic. Thus, if the government retains control over monetary policy (the discretionary\nregime), the outcome is even worse (third best). This is considered in subsection 3.2,\nbelow. However, the global optimality of the precommitment solution serves as a useful\nbenchmark.\n3.1. The Precommitment Regime (The optimal rational expectations solution)\nThe sequence of moves is described in \u0085gure 3.1, below.\nTreasury sets state\ncontingent policy\nrules, )(),( ee fi\nPublic forms\ninflationary\nexpectations, ep\nRealization of\nthe demand\nshock, e\nFigure 3.1: Sequence of moves for the precommitment regime\nThe solution method is to \u0085nd state contingent rules for the policy variables, (iL; fL),\n(iH ; fH), that maximize the expected value of the social welfare (2.13). The results are\nsummarized in Proposition 1.\n30It is variously referred to as the \u0091precommitment solution\u0092, the \u0091optimal rational expectations solution\u0092,\nthe \u0091second best solution\u0092or simply the \u0091optimal solution\u0092.\n11\nProposition 1 : Under the optimal state-contingent rational expectations precommit-\nment solution, the economy is always liquidity trapped when \u000f = \u0000a but not when \u000f = a.\nThe expected utility in the precommitment regime is given by E\n\u0010\nUOptS\u0014\n\u0011\n= \u00001\n5\na2 \u0000 1\n2\ny2.\nThe full solution is given in the Table below.\n\u000f = \u0000a < 0 \u000f = a > 0 \u000fe = \u00000:5a+ 0:5a = 0\nInterest rate iL = 0 iH = 6a=5 ie = 3a=5\nFiscal policy fL = 2a=5 fH = 0 f e = a=5\nOutput yL = \u0000a=5 yH = a=5 ye = 0\nIn\u0087ation \u0019L = a=5 \u0019H = 3a=5 \u0019e = 2a=5\nReal interest rate iL \u0000 \u0019e = \u00002a=5 iH \u0000 \u0019e = 4a=5 ie \u0000 \u0019e = a=5\nSince the economy is liquidity trapped when \u000f = \u0000a, monetary policy is ine\u00a4ective\nin this case, iL = 0. Hence, the government resorts to using the expensive \u0085scal policy,\nfL =\n2\n5\na, in order to \u0091lean against the wind\u0092. By contrast, when \u000f = a, monetary policy is\ne\u00a4ective, iH = 65a, and the government has no need for the expensive \u0085scal instrument, so\nfH = 0.31\nRecalling that y denotes deviation of output from the natural level, output is below the\nnatural rate in the liquidity trap (\u000f = \u0000a) but above it otherwise (\u000f = a). On average, it\nequals the natural rate. In\u0087ation is positive in both states of the world. The real interest\nrate is negative32 in the liquidity trap but positive otherwise and on average.\nRecall that the shocks take the two possible values, \u0000a and a and, so, V ar (\u000f) = a2.\nThus, on average, ceteris paribus, in\u0087ation, interest rates and the \u0085scal instrument of\nthe government will display greater variability in economies where demand shocks exhibit\ngreater variability and precommitment is possible. Furthermore, the magnitude of policy\ninstruments employed in the two states of the world, fL = 25a and iH =\n6\n5\na, are increasing\nin the size of the shock. This is not surprising as each of these policies ful\u0085lls a stabilization\nrole and a larger shock elicits a greater e\u00a4ort in \u0093leaning against the wind\u0094.\nThe solution is independent of y, society\u0092s desired output relative to the natural rate.\nAs in time consistency models in the absence of the liquidity trap, this occurs because even\nif society has a high y, the precommitment technology allows it to counter expectations of\nex-post surprise in\u0087ation (designed to push output towards the high target).\nThe magnitude of social welfare in this regime depends negatively on the variance of\nshocks hitting the economy, a2, and negatively on the output target of society, y.\nFinally, note that the values of the instruments, iH , iL, fH , fL, are optimal ex-ante.\nHowever, after the realization of the shock, \u000f = \u0000a or \u000f = a, the ex-post optimal values\n31Recall that f refers only to the stabilization component of \u0085scal policy, hence, fH = 0 is consistent\nwith a strictly positive level of government expenditure on other items such as redistribution etc.\n32We conjecture that the combination of rigid wages-prices and a \u0087exible nominal interest rate has the\ne\u00a4ect that the real interest rate, i\u0000 \u0019e, overshoots so as to equilibrate the economy.\n12\nof i, f will, in general, be di\u00a4erent from these. Thus, for successful implementation, this\noptimal rational expectations solution needs a precommitment technology. We discuss this\nin Section 4 below. Next, we turn to the second regime in the paper, discretion.\n3.2. Discretionary Regime\nIn the discretionary regime, the monetary instrument, i, and the \u0085scal instrument, f , are\nboth assigned to the Treasury. We calculate the time consistent discretionary policy. The\nsequence of moves is described in \u0085gure 3.2, below.\nPublic forms\ninflationary\nexpectations, ep\nRealization of the\ndemand shock, e\nTreasury sets\nfiscal, monetary\npolicy, )(),( ee fi\nFigure 3.2: Sequence of moves when Treasury controls i, f .\nTo \u0085nd the discretionary solution, we \u0085rst need to \u0085nd the values of the policy variables\niL (\u0019\ne), fL (\u0019e) and iH (\u0019e), fH (\u0019e) that maximize social welfare (2.11) conditional on\ngiven \u0019e, \u000f. This allows the computation of the state-contingent in\u0087ation rates \u0019L (\u0019e)\nand \u0019H (\u0019e). Then we \u0085nd the \u0085xed-point \u0019e by solving\n\u0019e =\n1\n2\n\u0019L (\u0019\ne) +\n1\n2\n\u0019H (\u0019\ne) . (3.1)\nFinally, substitute the value for \u0019e back into the state-contingent policy variables iL (\u0019e),\nfL (\u0019\ne) and iH (\u0019e), fH (\u0019e) to \u0085nd the solution under discretion. Depending on the para-\nmeter values, a liquidity trap may, or may not, arise. Proposition 2 below summarizes the\nresults when a liquidity trap arises, which is the focus of this paper33.\nProposition 2 : For y < a \u0014 2y, the economy is liquidity trapped for \u000f = \u0000a < 0 but\nnot liquidity trapped for \u000f = a > 0. The expected social welfare is given by E\n\u0000\nUDiscS\n\u0001\n=\n12ay \u0000 8y2 \u0000 5a2. The full solution under discretion is given in the Table below.\n33The full set of results under discretion is given in Appendix-B of Dhami and al-Nowaihi (2007).\n13\n\u000f = \u0000a < 0 \u000f = a > 0 \u000fe = \u00000:5a+ 0:5a = 0\nInterest rate iL = 0 iH = 4y \u0000 2a ie = 2y \u0000 a\nFiscal policy fL = 2(a\u0000 y) fH = 0 f e = a\u0000 y > 0\nOutput yL = y \u0000 a < 0 yH = a\u0000 y ye = 0\nIn\u0087ation \u0019L = 4y \u0000 3a \u0019H = 2y \u0000 a \u0019e = 3y \u0000 2a\nReal interest rate iL \u0000 \u0019e = 2a\u0000 3y iH \u0000 \u0019e = y ie \u0000 \u0019e = a\u0000 y\nFor stabilization purposes, the costly \u0085scal policy is used only in a liquidity trap when\nthe monetary policy looses e\u00a4ectiveness. As in the precommitment solution, deviations of\noutput from the natural rate are zero on average, i.e., ye = 0. The following proposition\ncompares expected social welfare under Precommitment with that under Discretion.\nProposition 3 : For y < a \u0014 2y, E\n\u0010\nUOptS\n\u0011\n\u0000 E \u0000UDiscS \u0001 = 310 (5y \u0000 4a)2 \u0015 0.\nAs one would expect, the presence of a liquidity trap does not alter the ranking between\nthe Precommitment and the Discretion regimes, from a social welfare point of view. In\nfact, the ranking E\n\u0000\nUDiscS\n\u0001\n< E\n\u0010\nUOptS\n\u0011\nholds for all parameter values. However, we have\nonly reported it for the most interesting case, namely, when a liquidity trap occurs.\n3.3. Alice through the looking glass\nKrugman (1998) observed that \u0091applying conventional modelling to liquidity trap con-\nditions produces unconventional conclusions and policy recommendations\u0092. To which he\nadded (1999) \u0091The whole subject of the liquidity trap has a sort of Alice-through-the-\nlooking-glass quality\u0092. And indeed, our model exhibits these features, as we will now see.\n3.3.1. Precommitment can have higher in\u0087ation than Discretionary\nIt is well known in the traditional time inconsistency literature, in the absence of a liquidity\ntrap, that the optimal level of average in\u0087ation is zero (given (2.9)) while under discretion it\nis positive (unless y = 0, in which case it is also zero). The reason is that under discretion,\nagents perceive (correctly) that the government has an ex-post incentive to create surprise\nin\u0087ation, while under precommitment, ex-post surprise in\u0087ation is institutionally ruled out.\nWhen a liquidity trap occurs with a positive probability, this result changes dramatically.\nFrom Proposition 1, we see that the optimal level of average in\u0087ation under precom-\nmitment now is positive (\u0019e = 2a=5), rather than zero. Under discretion, \u0019e depends on y.\nFor y = a=2, Proposition 2 gives a negative average expected in\u0087ation rate (\u0019e = \u0000a=2),\nrather than a positive one. Eggertsson (2006a, 2006b) calls this the de\u0087ation bias.\nThe intuitive explanation is as follows. Under precommitment, it is optimal to have\npositive in\u0087ation on average (\u0019e = 2a=5), despite its cost, to be able to deliver negative\n14\nreal interest rates (iL\u0000\u0019e = \u00002a=5) in the bad state of the world (\u000f = \u0000a). However, this\noptimal policy is time inconsistent. If ex-post, the economy is in the good state (\u000f = a)\nthen the optimal real interest rate is positive (iH\u0000\u0019e = 4a=5) which can be achieved more\ncheaply with zero in\u0087ation. Hence, the policy maker has the incentive to renege on its\ncommitment to positive in\u0087ation. The rational private sector will perceive this and expect\nlow future in\u0087ation. This destroys the credibility of the announcement of high in\u0087ation,\nunless a commitment technology is available.\n3.3.2. Higher output targets are a good thing\nIn the standard textbook model in the absence of a liquidity trap, a higher value of desired\noutput relative to the natural rate, y > 0; is bad because it leads to high in\u0087ation and\nno gain in output (ye = 0). The reverse occurs with a liquidity trap. y > 0 is now good!\nThe intuition is that a higher y increases in\u0087ationary expectations (see Proposition 2),\nwhich by reducing the real interest rate in a liquidity trap, reduces the need for using the\nexpensive \u0085scal instrument.\nIf society has a high enough output target (and the Treasury follows it) then, in the\ndiscretionary regime, ex-post, a liquidity trap will not arise. However, this outcome might\nrequire using the costly \u0085scal instrument excessively, which could be suboptimal. In section\n4, below, we show this to be precisely the case.\n4. Institutions and Delegation\nIn the delegation regime considered in this section, society gives the Central Bank the\nmandate of achieving an in\u0087ation target \u0019B. The monetary instrument, which is the\nnominal interest rate, i, is assigned to the Central Bank whose objective is to attain the\nin\u0087ation target \u0019B. We formalize this by assigning the following objective function to the\nCentral Bank,\nUB = \u00001\n2\n(\u0019 \u0000 \u0019B)2 : (4.1)\nThe \u0085scal instrument, f , is controlled by the Treasury whose objective function is\nsimilar to that of society in (2.9) but with, possibly, di\u00a4erent in\u0087ation and output targets,\nUT = \u00001\n2\n(y \u0000 yT )2 \u0000 1\n2\n(\u0019 \u0000 \u0019T )2 \u0000 f 2 . (4.2)\nThe output target of the Treasury is given by yT . It is important to bear in mind the\ndi\u00a4erence between the socially desirable output level, y, and the Treasury\u0092s output target,\nyT . In order to maximize the social objective function in (2.9), society might assign some\ntarget value, y\u0003T , of yT to the Treasury. The Treasury is assumed to comply with the target\n15\ny\u0003T even if y\n\u0003\nT 6= y. It seems reasonable, though not necessary, to assign the same in\u0087ation\ntarget to the Treasury, \u0019T = \u0019B, as assigned to the Central Bank.34\n4.1. The Optimal Delegation Regime\nUnder optimal delegation, the game has the following \u0085ve sequential stages.\n1. Society optimally assigns an in\u0087ation target, \u0019B, to the Central Bank and the output,\nin\u0087ation targets, yT ; \u0019T to the Treasury.\n2. The public observes \u0019B; yT ; \u0019T and then forms in\u0087ationary expectations, \u0019e.\n3. The demand shock, \u000f, which takes two possible values, a;\u0000a, is realised.\n4. The Treasury (Stackelberg leader) sets state contingent \u0085scal policy f (\u0019e; \u000f).\n5. The Cental Bank (Stackelberg follower) sets state contingent monetary policy i (\u0019e; \u000f).\nGiven the sequence of moves, the Central Bank sets monetary policy taking as given\nthe \u0085scal policy set by the Treasury. The Treasury sets \u0085scal policy, taking into account\nthe anticipated response of the Central Bank. We solve the game backwards. First we\nobtain the Central Bank\u0092s optimal reaction function i = i (\u0019B; \u0019e; f; \u000f) by maximizing UB.\nSecond, we \u0085nd the Treasury\u0092s optimal reaction function f = f (yT ; \u0019T;\u0019e; \u000f) by maximizing\nUT . This allows us to derive output and in\u0087ation as functions of yT , \u0019T , \u0019B, \u0019e, \u000f. Third,\nwe determine \u0019e, assuming rational expectations on the part of the private sector. Fourth,\nwe \u0085nd the expected social welfare, EUS, as a function of yT , \u0019T , \u0019B, which we maximize\nto \u0085nd the optimal values of yT , \u0019T , \u0019B, denoted by y\u0003T , \u0019\n\u0003\nT , \u0019\n\u0003\nB. We assume that the\nTreasury and Central Bank fully comply with the objectives assigned to them. We now\nstate our main result in Proposition 4, i.e., the optimal delegation regime achieves the\noptimal rational expectations solution.\nProposition 4 : Assume that monetary policy is delegated to an independent Central\nBank with in\u0087ation target \u0019\u0003B =\n3\n5\na. Fiscal policy is retained by the Treasury with output\ntarget y\u0003T =\n1\n5\na. The Treasury acts as the Stackelberg leader. Then the optimal rational\nexpectations (precommitment) solution (see Proposition 1) is achieved. Society\u0092s expected\nutility in the optimal delegation regime is given by E\n\u0000\nUODS\n\u0001\n= \u00001\n5\na2 \u0000 1\n2\ny. The economy\nis liquidity trapped only under adverse demand shocks. In\u0087ation and output targets are\nachieved in the good state but not in the bad state.35\n34Our analysis allows one to consider both the cases: \u0019T = \u0019B and \u0019T 6= \u0019B :\n35As stressed by Eggertsson and Woodford (2003), failure to meet the in\u0087ation target in the liquidity\ntrap does not signify failure of policy. A similar remark can be made with respect to the output target.\n16\nThe next proposition shows that our suggested institutional solution is very \u0087exible in\nterms of the mixture between optimal output and in\u0087ation contracts for the Treasury. We\ndiscuss this proposition in section 5 below.\nProposition 5 : Any mixture of output and in\u0087ation targets for the Treasury, yT , \u0019T ,\nthat satisfy yT +\u0019T = 45a, will achieve the optimal rational expectations (precommitment)\nsolution (see Proposition 1 and 4), provided \u0019B = \u0019\u0003B =\n3\n5\na.\n4.2. Credibility36\nThere is an in\u0085nity of pairs of output-in\u0087ation targets for the Treasury that implement\nthe optimal rational expectations (precommitment) solution. However, one particular\npair in which the Central Bank\u0092s and Treasury\u0092s optimal in\u0087ation targets coincide, i.e.,\n(y\u0003T ; \u0019\n\u0003\nT ) = (y\n\u0003\nT ; \u0019\n\u0003\nB) =\n\u0000\n1\n5\na; 3\n5\na\n\u0001\nhas special salience.\nTo see this, compare (y\u0003T ; \u0019\n\u0003\nB) with the other candidate in which output equals its\nnatural level, i.e., (y\u0003T ; \u0019\n\u0003\nT ) =\n\u0000\n0; 4\n5\na\n\u0001\n.37 Note the following features of the candidate\n\u0000\n0; 4\n5\na\n\u0001\n:\n(1)\n\u0000\n0; 4\n5\na\n\u0001\nsets the Treasury an in\u0087ation target, 4\n5\na, greater than that assigned to the Bank,\n\u0019\u0003B =\n3\n5\na. (2) The in\u0087ation target, 4\n5\na, is never achieved (in any state of the world). (3)\nThe output target, y = 0, is only achieved on average but neither when the economy is\nliquidity trapped (\u000f = \u0000a) nor when non-liquidity trapped (\u000f = a). (4) It would appear\nstrange to the public that the Treasury and Bank are assigned di\u00a4erent in\u0087ation targets.\nBy contrast, the target (y\u0003T ; \u0019\n\u0003\nB) =\n\u0000\n1\n5\na; 3\n5\na\n\u0001\nhas the following attractive features. (1)\nIt is achieved during normal times, i.e., when the economy is not liquidity trapped (recall\nProposition 1, which is implemented by these targets). (2) The Bank and the Treasury\nare assigned the same in\u0087ation target which is important for reasons of transparency and\ncredibility of policy. For these reasons, we believe that (y\u0003T ; \u0019\n\u0003\nB) =\n\u0000\n1\n5\na; 3\n5\na\n\u0001\nis the superior\nchoice from the set of all targets consistent with Proposition 5.38\nWhy does the optimal delegation regime perform so well? The in\u0087ation target given\nto the Central Bank provides a commitment to the necessary in\u0087ation level when the\neconomy is not in a liquidity trap. In the absence of such a target, there will be an\nincentive to reduce in\u0087ation outside a liquidity trap. Such a commitment a\u00a4ects the\n(ex-ante) in\u0087ation expectations ensuring the correct value for the real interest rate in a\nliquidity trap. Furthermore, in\u0087ationary expectations are also in\u0087uenced correctly by the\noutput and in\u0087ation targets given to the Treasury. The latter provide the Treasure with\nthe incentive to use the appropriate level of \u0085scal policy in a liquidity trap. Such an\ninstitutional regime achieves the optimal balance between \u0085scal and monetary policy by\n36We are grateful to both referees for raising the issues discussed here.\n37Note that both (y\u0003T ; \u0019\n\u0003\nB) =\n\u0000\n1\n5a;\n3\n5a\n\u0001\nand\n\u0000\n0; 45a\n\u0001\nsatisfy condition of Proposition 5.\n38These issues are treated formally in al-Nowaihi and Levine (1996).\n17\nneither having to rely too much on costly in\u0087ation outside the liquidity trap nor relying\ntoo much on costly \u0085scal policy in a liquidity trap.\nDhami and al-Nowaihi (2007) show that these results generalize to more general prob-\nability distributions of the shocks, persistence in shocks, full set of parameters of the\naggregate demand and aggregate supply curves and more general objectives of the Trea-\nsury. These generalizations serve to assure us that the results of this model do not arise\nbecause of the simplicity of the model. Rather, the results are more fundamental. How-\never, the extensions come at a very substantial cost in terms of complexity. The simpler\nmodel is pedagogically much superior. While we allow for the economy to fall in a liquidity\ntrap with some probability, this probability, in the more general model can be quite small.\n4.3. Debt39\nRecall, from Proposition 1, that for the optimal solution, \u0085scal policy is expansionary in a\nliquidity trap but neutral outside it. Hence, it is expansionary on average. An important\nquestion, therefore, relates to the implications for government debt. In particular, is this\nsolution compatible with a bounded debt to GDP ratio? Since the optimal delegation\nregime implements the optimal solution (Proposition 4), the same issue arises for the\noptimal solution as well.40 Our answer is three-fold.\nFirst, as remarked in subsection 2.1, above, f could be a temporary balanced budget\nreallocation of taxes and subsidies that has a net expansionary e\u00a4ect; as in Dixit and\nLambertini (2000).\nSecond, the total \u0085scal budget, F , could have two (or more) components: F = f0+f +\n:::, where f0 is a \u0085xed budget surplus (hence, in our notation, f0 < 0) and f is the variable\ncomponent that is positive in a liquidity trap but zero outside it. f0 can then be chosen so\nthat E (f0 + f) = 0 which ensures that the government budget holds in expected terms;\nsee Varian (1980).\nThird, suppose that f is \u0085nanced entirely from debt (and assume no surpluses or\nde\u0085cits are generated out of a liquidity trap). Then f is the magnitude of new nominal\ndebt. Assume that nominal GDP is normalized to one and, so, f is also the ratio of new\ndebt to GDP. Now let us look at in\u0087ation, \u0019, relative to f . From Proposition 1, f e = a=5\nbut \u0019e = 2a=5. Hence, on average, the new debt, arising from debt \u0085nancing of the \u0085scal\nexpansion in a liquidity trap, could (if desired) be \u0085nanced entirely from in\u0087ation.\nThus, the fact that \u0085scal policy is, on average, expansionary under optimal delegation\nis consistent with a bounded debt to GDP ratio.\n39We are grateful to Referee 2 for raising this issue.\n40We are grateful to Referee 2 for raising this issue.\n18\n4.4. Related literature\nThe theoretical literature has considered some aspects of our optimal delegation regime,\nthat achieves the precommitment solution. For instance, in\u0087ation targets have been sug-\ngested in Krugman (1998), Nishiyama (2003), and Iwamura et al. (2005). Other variants\nof monetary policy commitment have also been considered. Benhabib Schmitt-Grohe and\nUribe (2002) consider a commitment to switch from an interest rate rule to a money growth\nrate peg in a liquidity trap. Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) propose a commitment to\nadjust nominal interest rates to achieve a time varying price level target. Bernanke (2002)\nsuggests a commitment to a bu\u00a4er zone for the in\u0087ation rate. Svensson (2003) advocates\na price level target (as part of a larger set of policies). However, none of these models\nallow for the possibility of strategic interaction between monetary and \u0085scal authorities\nnor jointly derive the optimal set of targets and instruments of the two policy making\nauthorities.\nEggertsson (2006a, 2006b) studies the liquidity trap within a new Keynesian stochastic\ngeneral equilibrium model with a government budget constraint and explicit microfounda-\ntions. Eggertsson recommends abandonment of an independent central bank and a return\nto discretionary policy by a unitary monetary-\u0085scal authority. A debt \u0085nanced \u0085scal ex-\npansion during a liquidity trap results, via the government budget constraint, in higher\nexpectations of future in\u0087ation. Eggertsson shows that this solution is superior to either\nmonetary policy alone or uncoordinated monetary and \u0085scal policy. However, as Eggerts-\nson shows, even optimal discretion is inferior to the fully optimal rational expectations\nsolution with commitment. Moreover, abandoning delegation of monetary policy to an in-\ndependent central bank with a narrow mandate, in favor of a return to discretion, appears\nto be a retrograde step.\nDixit and Lambertini (2003) and Lambertini and Rovelli (2003) consider strategic\ninteraction between \u0085scal and monetary authorities, but in the absence of a liquidity trap.\nLambertini and Rovelli (2003) show that the equilibrium with the \u0085scal authority acting\nas leader is superior to the Nash equilibrium. Dixit and Lambertini (2003) show that this\nregime can achieve the optimal precommitment rational expectations solution.\n5. Conclusions\nIn a liquidity trap, with nominal interest rates bound below by zero, an expectation of\npositive in\u0087ation is needed to reduce the real interest rate and, so, to boost economic\nactivity. This, in turn, needs a credible commitment to a future level of positive actual\nin\u0087ation. The credibility problem comes about because after the economy has escaped from\nthe liquidity trap, it is in the interest of all parties to renegotiate and reduce in\u0087ation. A\n19\nforward looking private sector will anticipate this and expect low future in\u0087ation. With\nlow expected future in\u0087ation, the real interest rate remains positive, keeping the economy\nin the liquidity trap; see for instance Krugman (1998).\nThe \u0085rst best solution obtains when the rigidities that give rise to the liquidity trap\nare removed. But removal of these distortions is usually slow and di\u00a2 cult (witness the\nexperience of Japan). Therefore, macroeconomic policy can play an important role. Fur-\nthermore, the Japanese experience suggests that issues of strategic monetary \u0085scal policy\ninteraction and of appropriate institutional design, assume even greater importance in a\nliquidity trap.\nIn the solution considered in this paper, society delegates monetary policy to an op-\nerationally independent Central Bank with an in\u0087ation target. Fiscal policy is delegated\nto the Treasury with in\u0087ation and output targets. Furthermore, the Treasury acts as a\nleader and the Central Bank is the follower. The required institutional arrangements are\nquite natural and are able to achieve the second best solution, namely, the optimal rational\nexpectations precommitment solution. This institutional setting provides (1) the appro-\npriate level of in\u0087ation and, hence, in\u0087ation expectations, and (2) the optimal balance\nbetween monetary and \u0085scal policy.\n6. Appendix\nProof of Proposition 1 (Precommitment)\nWe seek those values of fL, fH , iL and iH that maximize E (US) (as given by (2.13))\nsubject to iH \u0015 0 and iL \u0015 0.

(6.10)\nSuppose the economy was not liquidity trapped in either state. Then (6.9) and (6.10)\nwould imply that iH = a and iL = \u0000a; which cannot be since iL \u0015 0 and a > 0. Suppose\nthe economy was liquidity trapped in the high state (\u000f = a). Then, iH = 0 and, from\n(6.9), 1\n3\niL + 2a \u0014 0; which cannot be, since iL \u0015 0 and a > 0. Hence, the only solution to\n(6.9) and (6.10) is that the economy is liquidity trapped in the low state (\u000f = \u0000a) but not\nin the high state (\u000f = a), with\niL = 0, iH =\n6\n5\na.

Using (6.37), fL + 2\u0019e \u0000 \u0019B \u0000 a < 0 implies that\niL = 0, with fL + 2\u0019e \u0000 \u0019B \u0000 a < 0. (6.38)\n23\nCase-II: The economy is not in a liquidity trap ( \u000f = a)\nIn this case @UB\n@i\n= 0 is satis\u0085ed with i \u0015 0.

(6.39)\nThe state contingent reaction function of the monetary authority is given by (6.38) and\n(6.39).\nFiscal authority\u0092s reaction function\nThe Treasury now chooses its state contingent \u0085scal policy f to maximize the objective\nfunction (4.2) after observing \u0019e and \u000f and knowing that the state contingent reaction\nfunction of the monetary authority is given by (6.38) and (6.39).\nCase-I: Liquidity trapped ( \u000f = \u0000a)\nIn this case, the subsequent monetary policy is iL = 0, hence, using (2.5), (2.6), (4.2),\nthe Treasury maximizes\nULT = \u0000\n1\n2\n(fL + \u0019\ne \u0000 a\u0000 yT )2 \u0000 1\n2\n(fL + 2\u0019\ne \u0000 a\u0000 \u0019T )2 \u0000 f 2L. (6.40)\nMaximizing ULT (unrestrictedly) with respect to fL gives\nfL =\n1\n2\na+\n1\n4\nyT +\n1\n4\n\u0019T \u0000 3\n4\n\u0019e. (6.41)\nCase-II: Not liquidity trapped ( \u000f = a)\nIn this case, the subsequent monetary policy is given by (6.39), hence, using (2.5),\n(2.6), (4.2), the government maximizes\nUHT = \u0000\n1\n2\n(\u0019B \u0000 \u0019e \u0000 yT )2 \u0000 1\n2\n(\u0019B \u0000 \u0019T )2 \u0000 f 2H . (6.42)\nMaximizing UHT with respect to fH gives\nfH = 0. (6.43)\nThe optimal state contingent reaction function of the \u0085scal authority is given by (6.41)\nand (6.43) respectively.\nSubstituting the state contingent monetary and \u0085scal policy reaction functions in (2.5)\nand (2.6) one obtains\nyL = \u00001\n2\na+\n1\n4\nyT +\n1\n4\n\u0019T +\n1\n4\n\u0019e, (6.44)\n\u0019L = \u00001\n2\na+\n1\n4\nyT +\n1\n4\n\u0019T +\n5\n4\n\u0019e, (6.45)\nyH = \u0019B \u0000 \u0019e, (6.46)\n24\n\u0019H = \u0019B. (6.47)\nCalculation of expected in\u0087ation\nSince the two states of the world are equally probable, \u0019e is simply a weighted average\nof in\u0087ation in (6.45) and (6.47) respectively\n\u0019e =\n1\n3\nyT +\n1\n3\n\u0019T +\n4\n3\n\u0019B \u0000 2\n3\na. (6.48)\nSubstituting \u0019e in (6.39), (6.41), (6.44)-(6.46), one obtains\nfL = a\u0000 \u0019B, (6.49)\nyL =\n1\n3\nyT +\n1\n3\n\u0019T +\n1\n3\n\u0019B \u0000 2\n3\na, (6.50)\n\u0019L =\n2\n3\nyT +\n2\n3\n\u0019T +\n5\n3\n\u0019B \u0000 4\n3\na, (6.51)\niH =\n2\n3\nyT +\n2\n3\n\u0019T +\n5\n3\n\u0019B \u0000 1\n3\na, (6.52)\nyH =\n2\n3\na\u0000 1\n3\nyT \u0000 1\n3\n\u0019T \u0000 1\n3\n\u0019B. (6.53)\nCalculation of the optimal in\u0087ation target\nFrom (2.9) and (6.43), we get that the expected social welfare is given by\nE\n\u0000\nUODS\n\u0001\n= \u00001\n4\n(yL \u0000 y)2 \u0000 1\n4\n\u00192L \u0000\n1\n2\nf 2L \u0000\n1\n4\n(yH \u0000 y)2 \u0000 1\n4\n\u00192H . (6.54)\nDi\u00a4erentiating (6.54) with respect to the targets yT , \u0019T and \u0019B we get, respectively,\n@EUODS\n@yT\n= \u00001\n6\n(yL \u0000 y)\u0000 1\n6\n\u0019L +\n1\n6\n(yH \u0000 y) , (6.55)\n@EUODS\n@\u0019T\n= \u00001\n6\n(yL \u0000 y)\u0000 1\n3\n\u0019L +\n1\n6\n(yH \u0000 y) , (6.56)\n@EUODS\n@\u0019B\n= \u00001\n6\n(yL \u0000 y)\u0000 5\n6\n\u0019L + fL +\n1\n6\n(yH \u0000 y)\u0000 1\n2\n\u0019H . (6.57)\nSetting @EU\nOD\nS\n@yT\n=\n@EUODS\n@\u0019T\n=\n@EUODS\n@\u0019B\n= 0 and solving simultaneously, using (6.47), (6.49),\n(6.50), (6.51) and (6.53), we get\n\u0019B =\n3\n5\na, (6.58)\nyT + \u0019T =\n4\n5\na. (6.59)\nSubstituting (6.58) and (6.59) in (6.54), using (6.47), (6.49), (6.50), (6.51) and (6.53),\ngives the \u0085nal expression for expected social welfare in the optimal delegation case\nE\n\u0000\nUODS\n\u0001\n= \u00001\n5\na2 \u0000 1\n2\ny. (6.60)\n25\nComparing (6.15) and (6.60), we see that the output targets (6.58) and (6.59) achieve\nthe same level of social welfare as the optimal solution. Moreover, substituting from (6.58)\nand (6.59) into (6.38), (6.43) and (6.47)-(6.53), then comparing with Proposition 1, we\nsee that these in\u0087ation and output targets achieve the optimal solution, with the economy\nliquidity trapped in the bad state only. Hence, the two other cases, when the economy\nis never liquidity trapped and when the economy is liquidity trapped in both states, need\nnot be considered; thus the proof is complete. \u0004\nReferences\n[1] Alesina, A. and Tabellini, G.
