It is deceptively\nsimple, and is much more interesting and varied than most linguists realize. This\nwas recognized by Jespersen: \u2018Number might appear to be one of the simplest\nnatural categories, as simple as \u201ctwo and two are four.\u201d Yet on closer inspection it\npresents a great many di\ufb03culties, both logical and linguistic\u2019 (Jespersen 1924: 188).\nLyons too pointed out its interest: \u2018The analysis of the category of number in par-\nticular languages may be a very complex matter\u2019 (Lyons 1968: 283). This book will\nillustrate the interest of number, and some \ufb01rst pointers are given in \u00a71.1. We shall\nalso see the challenges which Jespersen and Lyons allude to, one of the trickiest\nbeing the need to ensure that as we compare across languages we are really com-\nparing like with like (\u00a71.2). Hence the book is structured so as to work upwards\nfrom properties that are safe building blocks for comparison (\u00a71.3). Finally in this\nintroduction a few notes on presentation are needed (\u00a71.4).\n1.1 The special interest of number\nDespite the signi\ufb01cance of number, there are still surveys of linguistics where it\nreceives a footnote\u2019s worth of attention. This is largely because there are some rea-\nsonable but incorrect assumptions about number, which are generally based on the\nconsideration of a rather limited range of languages. In seeing where these assump-\ntions are false we shall get an initial idea of how interesting the category really is.\nFirst assumption: number is just an opposition of singular versus\nplural\nThere are indeed languages with this basic opposition. But there are also many lan-\nguages with richer systems, with a dual for two real world entities, some with a trial\nfor three, others with a paucal for a small number. There are more exotic possibil-\nities too, with the richest systems having \ufb01ve number values, as in Sursurunga.\nMoreover, some of the trickiest problems with number become much clearer when\nwe look at the evidence from larger systems, that is those with more than the basic\nsingular\u2013plural distinction.\n1\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press www.cambridge.org\nCambridge University Press\n0521640164 - Number\nGreville G. Corbett\nExcerpt\nMore information\nSecond assumption: all relevant items (nouns, for instance) will mark\nnumber\nWe might expect that, say, all nouns would show number. That clearly is not the\ncase, for instance English honesty does not mark plural. It seems natural to say that\nit is an abstract noun and that for certain abstract nouns number is not relevant.\nBut this is a parochial fact about English; there are languages where the proportion\nof items for which number is relevant in this sense is quite small, and others where\nnumber marking is practically always available. The possible ranges of number\nmarking are constrained in interesting ways.\nThird assumption: items which do mark number will behave the same\nSuppose that we carefully specify how many number values a particular language\nhas and which types of noun mark number. Having avoided our \ufb01rst two false\nassumptions, we might assume that items would either fail to mark number or\nwould show all the number values available. Once again, things are more interest-\ning than that. In Maltese, for instance, just a few nouns have singular, dual, and\nplural, while the majority of nouns and the pronouns have only singular and\nplural. Or in Bayso, pronouns have two number forms while typical nouns have\nfour.\nFourth assumption: number must be expressed\nIf number forms are available, then surely they must be used? This is an Anglo-\ncentric assumption and is quite false. We shall see instances where the marking of\nnumber is optional, and there are languages like Bayso where there are special\nforms which allow the use of a noun without any commitment to the number of\nentities involved. Linked to this assumption is the fact that number is usually\nthought of as prototypically in\ufb02ectional. The in\ufb02ection\u2013derivation distinction is\nbecoming a hot topic again in morphology and number is in fact highly proble-\nmatic in this respect. This book will provide a good deal of relevant material; the\npresentation will be as neutral as possible in order to include the relevant data for a\ncontinuing debate in which the criteria are likely to change.\nFifth assumption: number is a nominal category\nSo far our examples have involved nouns and pronouns. But there are languages\nwhere number is a verbal category, marking the number of events rather than the\nnumber of individuals. We return to this distinction in the next section.\nThe point which is emerging is that English and other familiar Indo-European lan-\nguages have quite unusual number systems; they occupy one corner of the typolog-\nical space. It is clear that to understand the category of number we need to look at\nIntroduction\n2\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press www.cambridge.org\nCambridge University Press\n0521640164 - Number\nGreville G. Corbett\nExcerpt\nMore information\na broad range of languages. Hale made a related point in a discussion of the\nproblem of language endangerment:\nwhile the category of number is accessible, in an obvious sense, its\nsurface realization across languages exhibits great diversity, and a\ngreat many individual languages fail to present the observable data\nwhich will permit us to get at the fundamental character of the\noppositions involved and, thereby, to come closer to an\nunderstanding of the universal organization and inventories of the\ncategory of number. (Hale 1997: 75)\nWe shall see several instances of interesting systems which are essential for appre-\nciating the full range of possibilities being found in languages which have few\nspeakers and are clearly endangered. And the prospects for language loss are par-\nticularly serious for number. There are perhaps 6,000 languages spoken at present,\nof which around 250 are \u2018safe\u2019: they are likely to survive another hundred years at\nleast. But these safe languages are not evenly distributed: over half of them belong\nto Indo-European or Niger-Kordofanian (Krauss 1992, 1993), while some families\nwith many languages of special interest for number are hardly represented at all. It\nis therefore important to identify and investigate the most interesting systems\nwhile there is still time. Our \u2018linguistic tour\u2019 in the book will include over 250 lan-\nguages. Several of these languages do not occur in the various typological samples\nand yet are vital for a full typology (Bayso is a good example). Hence this was a\ncase where it was appropriate to examine as many languages as possible, rather\nthan taking a de\ufb01ned sample. Many of the languages which were investigated will\nnot be mentioned since they turned out to be similar in the relevant respects to\nothers which are described here.\n1.2 Comparing like with like\nSince we shall look at a wide range of languages we must be careful to ensure that\nwe are comparing like with like. For instance, how do we know that a language has\nnumber? Languages like English have the category of number, since we \ufb01nd corre-\nspondences like the following:\nmagazine magazine-s\nhead head-s\nwoman women\nThere is a di\ufb00erence in meaning between magazine and magazines (obviously con-\ncerning the number of them), which corresponds to a di\ufb00erence in form. That\nsame di\ufb00erence in meaning is found in head\/heads and woman\/women. The \ufb01rst\nmember of each pair is said to be singular, and the second is plural. So when we say\n1.2 Comparing like with like\n3\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press www.cambridge.org\nCambridge University Press\n0521640164 - Number\nGreville G. Corbett\nExcerpt\nMore information\nthat English has singular and plural we are referring to correspondences of\nmeaning and form.\nIn many theoretical frameworks number, like comparable categories such as\ngender, case and person, is treated as a \u2018feature\u2019. This feature is said to have certain\n\u2018values\u2019 (for number, these include singular and plural, and we have already come\nacross others too).1 These values of the number feature have meanings and forms\nassociated with them. The main part of the meaning of the singular is that it refers\nto one real world entity, while the plural refers to more than one distinct real world\nentity. The formal expression of the plural in English is usually the addition of an\nending, as in magazines, heads, while the singular is usually signalled (on nouns) by\nthe absence of such a marker. But there are other ways of marking the plural too,\nas found in women and geese. It is the association of (a set of) meanings with (a set\nof) forms which allows us to talk of the singular and plural values of the feature\nnumber.\nThe plural may be realized in various di\ufb00erent ways in a given language. Rather\nthan listing all the forms on each occasion, linguists talk of \u2018plural forms\u2019.\nConversely, these plural forms may be used to express various related meanings,\nand here we may talk of \u2018plural meanings\u2019. However, as a shorthand, people often\ntalk of \u2018the plural\u2019 or \u2018the singular\u2019 when in fact just the meaning or just the form is\nintended. Normally the intention is clear but, particularly when comparing lan-\nguages, it is important to be explicit about which we intend, for the following\nreason. We do not expect the form of the plural to be the same in English as, say, in\nRussian: even if the morphological means used are similar (mainly in\ufb02ections in\nboth languages); we anticipate that there will be phonological di\ufb00erences between\nthem. Of course, we are correct (the items on the right are Russian translations of\nthe English):\nmagazine magazine-s \u0003urnal \u0003urnal-y\nhead head-s golov-a golov-y\nwoman women \u0003en\u0002\u0004in-a \u0003en\u0002\u0004in-y\nThe danger is that using the same term \u2018plural\u2019 for both forms and meanings may\nlead us to assume without question that though the forms di\ufb00er the same meanings\nare expressed. In fact there are small but not insigni\ufb01cant di\ufb00erences between the\nEnglish and Russian plural.\nAt this stage let us take an example where the di\ufb00erences are more obvious.\nEnglish and Russian have singular and plural, while Sanskrit had singular, dual\nIntroduction\n4\n1 An alternative terminology has number as a \u2018category\u2019 and singular as a \u2018property\u2019 or\n\u2018feature\u2019 (Matthews 1991: 39\u201340). We retain \u2018category of number\u2019 as a wider term, to\ninclude all manifestations of number, including number words (for which see \u00a75.1), as\nopposed to the category of gender, tense and so on.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press www.cambridge.org\nCambridge University Press\n0521640164 - Number\nGreville G. Corbett\nExcerpt\nMore information\nand plural. Sanskrit used the dual for referring to just two real world entities, and\nthe plural for more than two. Clearly the plural does not have the same meanings in\nEnglish or Russian as in Sanskrit: it covers cases where two items are referred to in\nthe former languages but not in Sanskrit (a general point made by Saussure\n1916\/1971: 161).\nHow then can we compare, say, the plural in di\ufb00erent languages? The \ufb01rst\nanswer must be \u2018with care\u2019, to ensure that we are indeed dealing with comparable\nthings. Provided \ufb01rst that we can establish that in each language under considera-\ntion there is a regular correspondence of meanings and forms which allows us to\ndemonstrate the existence of a number system, we can then compare the values in\nthe two languages. Typically the value which includes in its meaning reference to\nthe largest sets of referents will be called \u2018plural\u2019, whatever other meanings or\nrestrictions it may have. It is therefore reasonable to compare the degree of overlap\nbetween the use of the plural in the di\ufb00erent languages. (But we must be careful;\nfor instance, in descriptions of Cushitic languages \u2018plural\u2019 is used to indicate a set\nof forms whose use does not always correspond to plural in most other languages,\nas we shall see in \u00a76.1.1.) We shall \ufb01nd potentially confusing terminology for other\nnumber values too. The term \u2018collective\u2019 is used quite di\ufb00erently in di\ufb00erent tradi-\ntions. And there are subtler problems, for example where \u2018trial\u2019 is sometimes used\nof forms historically related to the numeral three but currently used for a small\nnumber (\u2018few\u2019). Thus although \u2018trial\u2019 is a possible term for the form in such lan-\nguages we shall choose our terms favouring meaning and so would call this a\n\u2018paucal\u2019.2 The important thing in such cases is to be explicit about what is\nintended. As a general rule we shall give priority to meaning in our choice of terms.\nThe last question we need to tackle at this early stage in our investigation is:\nWhat type of category is number? The obvious answer, certainly for speakers of\nIndo-European languages, is that it is a nominal category, a\ufb00ecting primarily\nnouns and pronouns. In our examples above, the di\ufb00erence between head and\nheads, golova and golovy is the number of heads involved. Of course, number may\nbe shown by verbs too in English (and Russian, and many other languages):\n(1) my dog watches television\n(2) my dogs watch television\nThough number is marked on the verb here as well as on the noun, the essential\ndi\ufb00erence between (1) and (2) is, of course, the number of dogs involved. This\npoint can be seen particularly clearly in these examples:\n1.2 Comparing like with like\n5\n2 Though we favour terms based on semantics, this does not entail any claim that particular\nnumber values are always used according to meaning. Thus we label the form cat \u2018singular\u2019\nbecause it is regularly used in expressions referring to a single cat; but there are also expres-\nsions, like more than one cat, where the singular is out of line with the semantics.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press www.cambridge.org\nCambridge University Press\n0521640164 - Number\nGreville G. Corbett\nExcerpt\nMore information\n(3) the sheep drinks from the stream\n(4) the sheep drink from the stream\nThough the form of the noun does not change, and the marker of number is on the\nverb, it still indicates the number of sheep involved. (Example (4) cannot be used in\nEnglish for the situation in which one sheep drinks several times.) In other words,\nwe have nominal number which happens to be expressed on the verb (usually, in\nEnglish, in addition to being expressed on the noun). Number in English is largely\nregular: words like dog ~ dogs greatly outnumber those like sheep ~ sheep and cri-\nterion ~ criteria. This suggests that number is an in\ufb02ectional category in English:\ndog (singular) and dogs (plural) are forms of the same lexical item DOG.\nThere are many languages which, broadly speaking, are comparable to English\nin this respect. But there are also many languages in which number is fundamen-\ntally di\ufb00erent: in particular it may be not a nominal category but a verbal one.\nMoreover it is often highly irregular and may not be an in\ufb02ectional category. Let us\nconsider brie\ufb02y what verbal number is. The following examples are from Rapanui\n(the language of Easter Island, one of the Oceanic languages within Austronesian:\ndata from Veronica Du Feu 1996: 191\u20132 and personal communication):\n(5) ruku\n\u2018dive\u2019\n(6) ruku ruku\n\u2018go diving\u2019\nThe form in (6) implies more than one dive, but not necessarily more than one\ndiver. Verbal plurality is indicated (by reduplication here) since the event is in a\nsense plural. There are other possibilities for verbal number, just as nominal\nnumber can be more complex and varied than the English data suggest, as we shall\nsee.\n1.3 Structure of the book\nWe begin with nominal number, since it is the part of number where we \ufb01nd the\ngreatest variety. In chapter 2 we look for as many meaning distinctions as we can\nidentify in the world\u2019s languages. We keep the nominal \u2018still\u2019 and see how many\ndi\ufb00erent number values it may have. Then in chapter 3 we hold the number value\nstill, and see which nominals may be involved. The possible patterns of involve-\nment in the number system are constrained by the Animacy Hierarchy, according\nto which, informally, the \u2018more animate\u2019 a nominal is the more likely it is to show\nnumber. We then allow both dimensions to vary together, that is to say, we attempt\na typology of what number values are possible for what nominals (chapter 4). This\nintegration of the two dimensions of the typology requires us to address the issues\nIntroduction\n6\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press www.cambridge.org\nCambridge University Press\n0521640164 - Number\nGreville G. Corbett\nExcerpt\nMore information\nof minor numbers, associatives and distributives, among others. In chapter 5 we go\non to the ways in which number is expressed, and in chapter 6 we discuss syntactic\nissues, mainly agreement but also including problems caused by numerals. Then we\nlook at other ways in which the means for expressing number can be used, and see\nthat there is a surprising range of uses, from honori\ufb01c to evasive use (chapter 7). In\nchapter 8 we survey verbal number, covering meaning distinctions, the items\ninvolved in the verbal number system and the ways in which verbal number is\nexpressed. In the concluding chapter we review what has been established about\nthe category of number, draw together strands of the material particularly on the\ndevelopment of number systems (their rise and decline) and on the interaction of\nnumber with other categories; and then we look forward to new ideas for research\ninto number.\n1.4 Presentation\nThe book is designed for readers of several di\ufb00erent types. For the student of lin-\nguistics, it is a guide to an area of obvious interest which has been neglected. And\nmore importantly, it attempts to give a picture of the tremendous richness and\ndiversity of the world\u2019s languages, by tackling a category where the familiar lan-\nguages of Western Europe are overshadowed by the complexities of systems found\nelsewhere in the world. It is also intended to assist those researching particular lan-\nguages or groups of languages, whether for a major research project or an under-\ngraduate essay. Seeing familiar material analysed in a typological context can give\na new perspective. This is particularly important for those areas where the termi-\nnology has become misleading, suggesting di\ufb00erences and similarities which do\nnot hold. It is hoped especially that the book will prove valuable to \ufb01eld-workers\nby giving them both helpful leads for analysis and the awareness of the types of\ndata which will enable us to understand the category of number more fully. The\ntask in this area is urgent since, as mentioned above, many of the crucial languages\nare endangered. The picture presented in the book has been built up out of many\nsmall pieces, and this should be made evident; hence there are many references in\nthe text, though where possible the detail is given in notes. There are extensive ref-\nerences for those who wish to go further. Since the work is organized thematically,\nspecial care has been taken so that those seeking data on speci\ufb01c languages can\n\ufb01nd the relevant references through the index.\nThe relevance of the book to typologists is evident: it is another example of the\napproach to typology which examines categories rather than constructions.\nFurthermore each chapter can be taken as illustrating a particular typological\npoint, and so the book may be used as a hands-on introduction to typology. For\nmorphologists, it should provide grist to the mill for those concerned with the rela-\ntions of in\ufb02ectional and derivational morphology (as noted in \u00a71.1). There is also a\n1.4 Presentation\n7\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press www.cambridge.org\nCambridge University Press\n0521640164 - Number\nGreville G. Corbett\nExcerpt\nMore information\nsubstantial amount of research in formal semantics on the nature of plurals; key\nreferences will be found in \u00a72.5. That work is starting to connect with the wide\nrange of number use in natural language: it is hoped that this book will be of use to\nsemanticists for that purpose.\nThe orthography used in examples normally follows that of the source, to enable\nthe reader to refer back easily, while for examples originally in a non-Roman script\na standard transliteration is used. Examples are followed by glosses. These are\nintended to clarify the point at issue rather than being full glosses. When items are\nsegmented in an example, this segmentation is mirrored in the gloss: smile-s\nsmile-3.SG, in which the s is glossed as \u20183.SG\u2019. Since the s cannot itself be seg-\nmented into constituent morphs representing third person and singular number\nseparately, the glosses for these, abbreviations in this case, are joined by a stop.\nAbbreviations are listed on page xix.\nIntroduction\n8\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press www.cambridge.org\nCambridge University Press\n0521640164 - Number\nGreville G. Corbett\nExcerpt\nMore information\n2\nMeaning distinctions\nIn this chapter we concentrate on the possible meaning distinctions in number\nsystems. Often the situation in languages like English is taken as normal, whereas it\nrepresents only one of the possibilities. We will \ufb01rst consider whether number needs\nto be expressed; we shall see that for some languages the expression of number is in\na sense optional, while in others it is a category which speakers cannot avoid. To\ninvestigate these systems we shall \ufb01rst consider the notion of \u2018general\u2019 number as a\nmeaning distinction and base a partial typology upon it (\u00a72.1). We then narrow our\nattention to the cases where number is expressed, and establish the main types of\ndistinction within the category (\u00a72.2). Thus \u00a72.1 is devoted to the opposition of\nnumber and \u2018non-number\u2019, while \u00a72.2 examines the possibilities within the number\ndomain. In \u00a72.3 we propose a typology, systematizing the material examined so far,\nand we go on to show that languages may simply not have a number system (\u00a72.4);\nthen we consider approaches to number within formal semantics (\u00a72.5).\nOur aim in this chapter is to \ufb01nd all the possible distinctions. At this stage we\nshall not be concerned about the type of nominal we look at, so long as we \ufb01nd\nthose which show the greatest di\ufb00erentiation. Keeping any particular nominal\n\u2018still\u2019 as it were, we shall see how many di\ufb00erent numbers it may have available, in\nthe most favourable contexts. In the next chapter we consider the possibilities\nalong the other dimension (holding a particular number distinction constant we\nshall examine which nominals can be involved in it). Then in chapter 4 we integrate\nthe account of the possible number systems with the possible patterns of involve-\nment of di\ufb00erent nominals. In these chapters we concentrate on the semantic dis-\ntinctions and we leave detailed consideration of the means used to express them for\nchapter 5. The more general typological point of this chapter is that as a \ufb01rst step\nwe must cast our nets widely; a category as familiar as number proves to be\nremarkably varied once we examine a broad range of languages.\n2.1 General number\nIn English we are usually forced to choose between singular and plural when\nwe use a noun. However, there are languages for which number is less dominant,\n9\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press www.cambridge.org\nCambridge University Press\n0521640164 - Number\nGreville G.

We shall call this \u2018general number\u2019, by which we mean that it is\noutside the number system. Various other terms have been used: Jespersen (1924:\n198) writes of the lack of \u2018a common number form (i.e. a form that disregards the\ndistinction between singular and plural)\u2019; Hayward (1979) introduced the term\n\u2018unit reference\u2019, the German tradition is to use \u2018transnumeral\u2019, as in Biermann\n(1982). We follow Andrzejewski (1960) in using the term \u2018general\u2019.\nGiven our de\ufb01nition of the meaning of general number, let us analyse its place in\nthe number systems of various languages. It is found in the Cushitic language\nBayso, which at the last count had a few hundred speakers on Gidicho Island in\nLake Abaya (southern Ethiopia) and on the western shore of the lake. Bayso\nnouns have a form which represents the general meaning, that is, it is non-commit-\ntal as to number (Corbett and Hayward 1987). L\u00faban \u2018lion\u2019 denotes a particular\ntype of animal, but the use of this form does not commit the speaker to a number\nof lions: there could be one or more than that. Other forms are available for indi-\ncating reference speci\ufb01cally to one or to more than one lion, when required.\nThe situation in which a language would have both a form outside the number\nsystem and a minimal number contrast can be diagrammed as in \ufb01gure 2.1. The\nmeaning of the noun may be expressed independently of number, as occurs with the\ngeneral meaning, or it may be expressed within the number system, which at its sim-\nplest means there will be a choice of singular or plural. In Bayso these meanings all\nhave independent forms: as we have already noted, l\u00faban \u2018lion(s)\u2019 is the general\nform. For reference to one lion, especially for reference to a speci\ufb01c lion, the singu-\nlar lub\u00e1ntiti \u2018a\/the particular lion\u2019 is used.1 Bayso actually has one more possibility\nthan the system in \ufb01gure 2.1, since for reference to a small number of lions, two to\nMeaning distinctions\n10\n11 Speci\ufb01city plays a role with the other numbers too; for instance, in phrases consisting of\nnoun plus numeral, number must be marked on the noun if there is a determiner or other\nmodifying element in the phrase, but otherwise it need not be (Dick Hayward, personal\ncommunication).

The labelling of the forms (as\nagain with hin\u00b7i \u2018these\u2019) is di\ufb03cult, since controller and target numbers do not match in\nBayso; see Corbett and Hayward (1987: 11\u201312) and \u00a76.1.1. In (ii) use of the paucal for the\nnoun is possible, but so is general number, while in (i) the paucal is required.\n\u00a9 Cambridge University Press www.cambridge.org\nCambridge University Press\n0521640164 - Number\nGreville G.
