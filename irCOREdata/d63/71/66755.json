While British colonial rhetoric consistently identified tradition as the basis of legitimate\nauthority, colonial practice actually produced far-reaching changes in the nature of government in Britain\u2019s\nAfrican possessions. New institutions, and new holders of power, emerged in African societies in response to the\nparticular needs of colonial administration. This article explores this transformation in one part of Con-\ndominium Sudan, which was effectively a British possession but which has often been excluded from historical\ndiscussions of the impact of colonialism because of its unique status. The NubaMountains have recently gained\nnotoriety as a particularly bloody theatre of Sudan\u2019s long post-colonial civil war ; while some have sought\nto explain this as the result of British policies which encouraged racial antagonism, the article suggests that\nhere, as elsewhere in Africa, the real legacy of colonial rule was the creation of new kinds of local government\nwhich sat uneasily with enduring local ideas of spiritual power and proper authority.\nI have watched an old generation give place to a new in India and I have seen how easily\nvague political unrest swept over backward peoples simply because we had allowed the\nold forms to crumble away. Yet the native states in India remain safe and secure in the hands\nof hereditary rulers.1\nEven before Lugard established \u2018Indirect Rule \u2019 as the creed of colonial admin-\nistration, officials in Britain\u2019s African possessions had tended to conservatism in\npolitical matters. The governor of British East Africa had warned in 1910 that\nabandonment of established authority would leave the tiny minority of white\nadministrators alone to face the \u2018rabble \u2019; planning the administration of Sudan, the\nman who was to become governor-general insisted in 1898 that \u2018 [i]t is a matter of\ngreat importance that the inhabitants should realize that their local traditions\nand former system of patriarchal government will be duly respected \u2019.2 Across\n* I should like to thank colleagues in the seminars at Humboldt University, the African Studies\nCentre at Cambridge University, and at the School of Oriental and African Studies for their comments;\nand also the anonymous referees of the Historical Journal.

The enthusiasm for traditional authority \u2013 and the consequent inven-\ntion of tradition \u2013 was to reach a peak after the First World War, when reliance\non a sort of effective indirect rule became commonplace even where the ideology\nof \u2018 IR\u2019 was not proclaimed.3 Even in the years of the \u2018 second colonial occu-\npation\u2019, after 1945, when empire reconstrued itself as an exercise in development\nand representative government, administrators privately (and not so privately)\ndoubted the wisdom of such innovations in \u2018nose-counting\u2019.4\nBut the innate anti-modernism of administrators (\u2018Catonism\u2019, as Berman has\ncalled it) had unintended consequences ; as Iliffe has argued, indirect rule was\n\u2018conservative in origin but radical in effect \u2019.5 Colonial administration was \u2018pre-\nfectural \u2019, functioning rather like a military chain of command and requiring\nobedience, above all else. Administrators needed \u2013 and offered power to \u2013 those\nwho were willing to defy propriety and challenge norms when the district com-\nmissioner needed labour, or tax.6 Consequently, multiple new kinds of authority\nemerged behind the occasionally frantic insistence on an authenticity derived from\ntradition. Mamdani has characterized all these as \u2018decentralized despotism\u2019, a\nspurious traditional power freed from long-established social constraints ; less\nsweepingly judgemental accounts have none the less argued that these forms\nwere innovative, and closely associated with the accumulative ambitions of local\n\u2018chiefs \u2019; and that they had profound political consequences.7\nStudies of this reshaping of African authority under the guise of colonial con-\nservatism have largely neglected Africa\u2019s largest political unit : Sudan. This is\nsymptomatic, for Sudan is an awkward child, historiographically as well as his-\ntorically. The fecundity of the Nile has drawn Sudan into straddling the desert\nboundary which elsewhere so neatly divides North Africa from the rest of the\ncontinent ; when Africa was partitioned, this was neither colony nor protectorate,\n3 The classic statement on invention is T.

The concerns, and the\nintellectual milieu, of the Britons who dominated the administration of the\nCondominium were actually strikingly similar to those of colonial officials else-\nwhere in Africa : they perceived the same problems, pursued similar policies \u2013 and\ncreated similar contradictions and ironies.10 And the question is not straight-\nforwardly that of whether the British sowed the seeds of racial strife. It is rather :\nwhy did the forms of local authority developed under the Condominium prove so\nunstable, and so ill-fitted to the demands of the post-colonial state?\nI\nIn 1934 Arthur Vicars-Miles, a veteran British administrator, set down some\nhelpful notes for officials newly posted to the Nuba Mountains of Sudan\u2019s Kor-\ndofan province.\nIt is easy for the newcomer to forget that only ten years ago many of the most enthusiastic\npro-Government Meks [chiefs] regarded the Government with the utmost suspicion, if not\nas their actual enemy. I have heard new arrivals say that they cannot understand why there\nwere constant patrols ; but I hope that this note will make them realise that the administra-\ntors of the past were for the most part as peace-loving as themselves, but they had to place\nthe problem of public security first. In any new country you must establish law and order\nbefore you can develop either culture or trade, and in doing so some eggs, as the saying\ngoes, have to be broken.11\nThe governmental omelette had been made with a particularly firm hand in\nthe Nuba Mountains : \u2018patrols \u2019 in the Nuba Mountains caused extensive death\nand destruction.12 Leaving aside this circumlocutory elision of colonial violence,\n8 The genesis and terms of the Condominium are best explained in M. Daly, Empire on the Nile : the\nAnglo-Egyptian Sudan, 1898\u20131934 (Cambridge, 1986), pp. 11\u201318.\n9 For opposing sides in this debate, see Mudaththir Abd al Rahim, Imperialism and nationalism in the\nSudan: a study in constitutional and political development, 1899\u20131956 (Oxford, 1969), pp. 7\u20139, 227; D. Wai, \u2018Pax\nBritannica and the Southern Sudan: the view from the theatre\u2019, African Affairs, 79 (1980), pp. 375\u201396.\n10 M.Daly, Imperial Sudan: the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium, 1934\u20131956 (Cambridge, 1991), p. 26, suggests\nthat the Sudan was structurally excluded from participating in many \u2018colonial \u2019 debates in the 1930s,\neven though its administrators faced many of the same policy issues as their fellows in the colonial\nservice. 11 Vicars-Miles, \u2018Notes on Nuba administration\u2019, p. 1, SAD 631\/10\/1-64.\n12 I have so far identified twenty-seven patrols in theNubaMountains which involvedmore than one\ncompany of soldiers: Tegali, 1903; Daier, 1904; Kitra, 1904; Shat-el-Safia, 1905; Nyima, 1908 and 1917 ;\nBurham, 1908; Katla, 1909, 1910, and 1925; Tagoi, 1910; Tira Lumman, 1910; Kimla, 1911 ; Krongo\nC O L ON I A L A U THOR I T Y I N NU B A 91\nVicars-Miles\u2019s comments were problematic in another way. There had been a\ndecline in large-scale violence in themountains : in 1918, a report said of one part of\ntheNubaMountains that \u2018administrative officials visiting \u2026 carry their life in their\nhands\u2019,13 while in the 1930s British administrators toured peacefully, escorted by\nonly three policemen \u2013 two of whom were needed to carry the co-domini\u2019s flags.14\nBut the decline was muchmore gradual thanVicars-Miles suggested : the real peak\nof \u2018patrol \u2019 violence had been between 1905 and 1912, with a brief resurgence in\n1917\u201319; and the last major patrol came in 1945, years after the \u2018Notes on Nuba\nAdministration\u2019 were written.15\nVicars-Miles\u2019s story of a recent rapprochement between meks and government\nwas intended as narrative of political legitimation through tradition : decades of\nfruitless reliance on deculturated upstarts improperly appointed asmeks had caused\nchronic violence, but by 1930 the government had begun co-operating with those\nwho held \u2018 traditional \u2019 authority within a distinctive \u2018Nuba culture \u2019.16 Recent\nscholarship on the Nuba Mountains has offered two contrasting interpretations of\nthis process. One sees this \u2018Nuba renaissance\u2019 as a particularly iniquitous example\nof the divisive racialization of politics and administration which characterized\nCondominiumpolicy, and undid the best efforts of the post-colonial state at nation-\nbuilding; the other suggests that this period entrenched a centralized and auth-\noritarian local form of the state which, maintained by the post-colonial state,\nprovoked the long, appalling, war which has killed and displaced tens of thousands\nof people in the Nuba Mountains in the last two decades.17 Focusing on one\nparticular area of the mountains \u2013 the Nyima hills, in the north-western corner of\nNuba \u2013 this article will argue rather that the development of colonial adminis-\ntration here fitted clearly into a wider pattern, evident elsewhere in the Sudan and\nacross British Africa. As an initial phase of large-scale violence slipped into a\nroutine of localized coercion, administrators believed that they had established an\naccommodation with tradition which would be stable and enduring. In practice,\nthey were co-operating with their chosen African agents in creating novel kinds of\nBakheit, 1911 ; Heiban, 1911; Tira el Akhdar, 1912, 1913, 1915, and 1922; Tendilla, 1913; Mandal, 1914;\nMiri, 1915; Koalib\/Lira, 1919; Tuleishi, 1926, 1945; Julud, 1926; Lafofa, 1929.

In 1908, eleven companies of infantry\nand Camel Corps attacked several of the hills, in an attempt to force the return of\ncaptives and livestock which Nyima raiders had taken from other hill communities\nor from Arabic-speaking nomads in the surrounding plains.19 Over a week, 100\ncattle and 500 sheep and goats were seized or destroyed and around fortymen from\nthe Nyima area killed ; standing crops were burned and houses destroyed.20 At\nthe end of this \u2018Nyima patrol \u2019 the governor of Kordofan confidently foresaw \u2018no\nmore serious trouble in the Western hills \u2019;21 but in 1917 an attempt to enforce the\npayment of tribute and the surrender of young men wanted for raiding ended in\nthe death of a British officer in a confused skirmish.22 An even larger patrol \u2013\n\u2018Patrol No. 32\u2019, by official designation \u2013 resulted. It involved more than 3,000\nsoldiers, with artillery and maxim guns.23 By late January 1918 more than 500 men\nfrom the hills had been killed ; the mek of Nyima and a ritual specialist allied to\nhim had surrendered and been publicly hanged for rebellion ; over 1,000 cattle\nhad been seized, crops and houses destroyed; and a further 500 young men had\nbeen conscripted into the army and marched away.24\nI I I\nIn the first two decades of the Condominium, one phrase recurred constantly in\ndiscussions of policy towards the Nuba Mountains. The populace must be \u2018 shown\nthe power of the Government \u2019; and disobedience could only be a sign that the\npeople \u2018have no idea of the power of the Government \u2019.25 Behind this phrase lay an\n18 S.

The people of the Nuba Mountains, however, were\n\u2018blacks \u2019 not Arabs, and \u2018 it is notorious that blacks place little credence in what they\nhear, but are only convinced by seeing or feeling\u2019.37\nA wild and ignorant population such as that of southern Kordofan can only be impressed\nwith a sense of their comparative insignificance by a display of power and they should be\nafforded a tangible sign of the power of the Government to enforce its administration when\nnecessary \u2026 For this reason I consider an increase in the garrison of Southern Kordofan\nnecessary, and patrols in sufficient force to overawe the native mind.38\nThis view of racial difference was an enduring one ; forty years later another\nadministrator explained in a private letter that he would never consider launching\na \u2018patrol \u2019 against Arabs, but that \u2018Nuba are quite different, dull-witted, without\nsensibility, primitive, obstinate and only half-acquainted with Arabic, you can\u2019t\nmanage them like Arabs \u2026 things can\u2019t be done without the use \u2013 or show \u2013 of\nforce. \u201939\nBritish colonial violence, like that of the French, also grew partly from individual\nambition.40 In the early years of the Condominium British officers in the Sudan\nwere technically officers of the Egyptian army, on secondment from their British\nregiments in search of adventure and decorations.41 There was a long waiting list\nfor service in the Egyptian army, which many sought to jump through personal\nappeal toWingate.42Once there, they longed for the \u2018 fun\u2019 of action: officers wrote\nprivately to Wingate, pleading that their units should be allowed to join patrols ;\na patrol to the Nuba Mountains in 1910 was \u2018 inundated with volunteers \u2019.43 Those\nwho had already secured their medals mocked their juniors, and deprecated the\nfinancial cost of violence. But despite concern that \u2018bloodthirsty medal-hunters \u2019\nlaunched unnecessary patrols, Wingate awarded Egyptian army promotions and\nmedals to those involved, and he used his personal contacts to seek British army\nrecognition of their service, to the point where complaints were raised by those\nserving elsewhere in the empire : \u2018The honors and rewards bestowed on the Army\n36 For a useful summary of this categorization, see H.

Wider\ndemands on resources limited patrols for most of the war, but the period from late\n1917 to 1919 saw a flurry of patrols, as soldiers experimented with new techniques\nof warfare. Even the governor-general could play a part, coming to visit the troops\non the front line in imitation of the visits of George V to cheer up the Tommies.45\nOverall, then, throughout the early decades of the Condominium, and when-\never coercive resources could be found, local British administrators \u2013 inspectors,\nup to 1920, and district commissioners (DCs) thereafter \u2013 sought to make their\navailability as apparent as possible. It was this which drove the lurching, unpre-\ndictable violence of the early colonial state. A touring inspector, or provincial\ngovernor, with a column of soldiers and police, would summon local meks and their\npeople to a meeting with the evident aim of intimidating them.46 Those who had\noffered direct defiance to government \u2013 and who refused to come along to these\ndisplays of government power47 \u2013 would be \u2018visited \u2019 by a patrol, and adminis-\ntrators sought to make the impact of these patrols as dramatic as possible, through\nsimple destruction: \u2018Finding no opposition we only burned the houses and killed\nall the animals \u2019 wrote Savile, the governor, in passing comment on the daily work\nof a patrol.48 Thus was the \u2018power of the Government \u2019 manifested : \u2018Only the\ncrudest actions will impress crude brains \u2019, observed one officer, in retrospective\njustification of the public display of the severed heads of the mek of Nyima and his\nprincipal ally.49\nI V\nBritish officials saw the people of the Nuba Mountains \u2013 \u2018 the Nuba\u2019 \u2013 as an em-\nbattled remnant populace, hemmed in by the Arabicized nomads of the sur-\nrounding plains.50 In the first decades of Anglo-Egyptian rule, they believed that\nthe Condominium had brought relief from such raids, and that the people of\n44 Ward, War Office to under secretary of state, Foreign Office, 3 Mar. 1902, PRO FO 78\/5239;\nAsser to Wingate, 12 Oct. 1910, SAD 298\/1\/35-9; Slatin to Wingate, 10 Dec. 1911, SAD 301\/6\/59-61.\nFor medal-seeking, see for example \u2018Special Army Order\u2019 of 20 Mar. 1909, SAD 701\/25\/317; Wingate\nto General Wynne, 28 Sept. 1908, 283\/9\/35-6; Wingate to Asser, 23 Aug. 1908, SAD 283\/5\/50-5.

Slaves and cattle were the prime objects of such raids : the slaves\nbeing kept for work; or as wives ; or being traded on to other communities in\nexchange for cattle and rifles.51 Officials were not sure whether \u2018 the Nuba\u2019 \u2013 who\nspoke a variety of languages, many of them unrelated and not intercom-\nprehensible \u2013 were a \u2018 tribe \u2019 or a \u2018race \u2019.52 But they were sure that these \u2018Negro\naborigines \u2019 were an ancient, remnant populace, where kings were helpless before\npriests : \u2018One has only to remember how Agag was slaughtered by Samuel after\nbeing spared by Saul. \u201953 In seeking to identify local rulers who could end such\nraiding \u2013 the men to whom the power of the government should be shown \u2013\nofficials decided that authority rested on the powers of \u2018Arro\u2019, or spirit, in each\nmountain and that it was the representative of this spirit (a figure for whom the\nBritish used the catch-all term \u2018kujur \u2019, widely used across the Sudan for non-\nIslamic ritual figures whom the British believed to be a dangerous threat to\nauthority) who wielded real power.54 Even where there was a secular figure of\nauthority as well, \u2018public life is ultimately in the hands of the rainmaker\u2019.55 The\nimplication for administrators was clear enough: it was the kujurs who had to\nbe shown the power of government, for all lived in fear of them.\nIn the 1920s officials began to present kujurs rather differently. From being the\n\u2018natural enemies of Government \u2019, who could only be overawed, and whose in-\nfluence must ultimately be reduced by the administration, they became potentially\ndesirable allies, and by the 1930s, Vicars-Miles could confidently insist that kujurs\nwere neither \u2018witch doctors \u2019 nor \u2018despots \u2019.56 The patrols had been the result\nnot of the deliberate resistance of these men, but of their reluctance to come\n51 J.

But by the time Vicars-Miles wrote they had been \u2018won over \u2019; and their\nauthority, based on the \u2018rigorous observance of ancient traditions \u2019, was being used\nin support of the government.57\nThis official rehabilitation of the kujurs accorded well with the enthusiasm for\n\u2018 indirect rule \u2019 and tradition which gripped British administrators in the Sudan in\nthe 1920s, as a result both of the wider colonial vogue for Lugard\u2019s theories and\nof the more local impact of the revolts and unrest in Egypt and Khartoum from\n1919 to 1924. This was, as Ranger has noted of British Africa widely, a period in\nwhich administrators had \u2018come to dislike the consequences of the changes which\nhad taken place \u2019; rueing the carelessness which had permitted political inno-\nvation, they set themselves ever more firmly against it.58 The arrival of a new\ngovernor-general in 1927, with an extravagant rhetoric of traditional authority\nas a hygienic barrier against the \u2018germs\u2019 of political discontent, gave additional\nimpetus.59 The rhetoric was taken up with enthusiasm by Angus Gillan, a long-\nserving administrator who was deputy governor and then governor of the pro-\nvince. Other changes created a need for a new policy : the Egyptian military\npresence in Sudan ended in 1924, and by 1926 the new \u2018SudanDefence Force \u2019 was\na modest 8,000 strong and the influence of the army in administration had greatly\ndeclined.60\nGillan had already concluded that the problem in theNubaMountains generally\nwas that many recognized meks were \u2018powerless \u2019 and that the real need was for the\n\u2018regeneration of tribal authority \u2019: simply showing meks the power of the govern-\nment, was not enough \u2013 they had to be made part of that power.61 This, in Gillan\u2019s\neyes, was the only alternative to endless, and ultimately unaffordable, patrols :\n\u2018Nuba wars have cost the Government much in money and something in lives.\nA prosperous and contented Nuba civilisation will not only cost less but will be a\ndirect asset to the country. \u201962\nThe new aim of policy was defined as a \u2018Nuba renaissance\u2019, and its proponents\nargued in vivid language for a cultural and racial separation between Nuba and\nArab: \u2018 I should like to lay stress on the undesirability of an Arab\u2013Nuba\nblend \u2026 The result is always an undisciplined, drunken, half-caste Arab who has\nno background and no tradition to keep him up to the mark. \u201963 The romance of\nnakedness encouraged colonial imaginings of Nuba essentialism: \u2018So wild and\nattractive \u2019, murmured one official\u2019s wife ; while an assistant district commissioner\n57 Vicars-Miles, \u2018Notes on Nuba administration\u2019, pp. 41\u20132, SAD 631\/10\/1-64.\n58 Ranger, \u2018The invention of tradition\u2019, p. 247.\n59 GGR, 1921, pp. 4\u20136; Daly, Empire on the Nile, pp. 360\u201379; \u2018Devolution in native administration\u2019,\nmemorandum with civil sec. to governor, 25 Jan. 1927, SAD 723\/5\/34-9.\n60 Daly, Empire on the Nile, p. 322.\n61 Gillan, ag. governor to civil sec., 24 May 1925, SAD 723\/5\/10; \u2018Devolution in native adminis-\ntration\u2019, 8 Mar. 1927, SAD 723\/6\/15-22. 62 Gillan, Some aspects of Nuba administration, pp. 56\u20137.\n63 Vicars-Miles, \u2018Notes on Nuba administration\u2019, p. 33, SAD 631\/10\/1-64.\n98 J U S T I N W I L L I S\n(ADC) pertly noted that \u2018our female visitors [were] delighted with the nakedness of\nthe people\u2019.64\nBut the practicalities of administration subverted the commitment to idealized\ntradition. Vehement though this rhetoric of essentialism and purity was on the\ndangers of the \u2018miserable, decadent, semi-arabicised Nuba\u2019,65 British officials\nsimply could not impose \u2018purity \u2019 and also maintain administration: the chronic\nfinancial problems of the early 1930s forced the administration to concentrate on\nrevenue and the promotion of trade, and the governor who succeeded Gillan\nannounced that \u2018we cannot deny progress to the Nuba\u2019. The mountains had\nbeen declared a \u2018closed district \u2019 in 1924, but the administration had conceded\nthat Arab residents of Kordofan could not be excluded as \u2018outsiders \u2019.66 The dis-\ntrict administration anyway lacked the means to police exclusion, and numerous\nMuslim religious specialists, petty traders and artisans entered the hills \u2013 including,\nby 1933, an estimated 1,000 West African migrants, working and trading on their\nslow journey toMecca.67 Florid pronouncements on protecting the Nuba gave way\nto concern over markets, and from 1934 a conference on trade and development\nbecame a major annual ritual of the provincial administration.68 Christian\nmissionaries, who had been encouraged to undertake educational work in the\nmountains as a counter to the influence of Muslim clerks, were appalled by the\nofficial decision to use Arabic, in Arabic script, as the basis of education.

As Baumann has suggested, the main\nthing shared by the populace of the mountains in the early twentieth century was\nthat they were all \u2013 in diverse ways \u2013 culturally very different from the Arabic-\nspeaking plains people.73 In seeking to reach behind the vision of the all-powerful\nkujur (which was presumably the result of extrapolating observations made in the\narea around the administrative centre of Dilling)74 Nadel\u2019s detailed ethnographic\nresearch in the 1930s, and the writings of Anglican missionaries (who spent much\nlonger in the area than did Nadel), offer valuable material, and suggest that\nauthority was contested, and appeared in many forms.\nWithin homesteads in Nyima, married men claimed authority over the labour\nand reproductive power of wives and daughters, and the labour of sons ; and they\nclaimed control of livestock and, to a large degree, of the crops. Women had\nsome authority over crops, and a degree of authority over the labour of their\ndaughters. Potentially challenging these claims were those of patrilineal clanship,\nwhich gave a degree of authority to more distant kin. There was a degree of\ncompetition between married men, who resented the claims of affines, or lineage\nelders, on the resources of their households ; accumulation was difficult in the face\nof a constant expectation of redistributive generosity. There also existed wider\nclaims to authority, going beyond kinship or affinal ties, in which ideas of power\nbestowed by a Divinity, or by spirits was central.75 Generational tensions played\nsome part, notably through theNyima age-grade organization for youngmen.This\nevidently changed considerably in the early decades of the twentieth century :\nconfusions in Nadel\u2019s account, and disagreements between his observations and\nthose of the missionaries presumably reflect the difficulties \u2013 for Nyimang, and for\nacademic observers \u2013 of trying to reconstruct a system which (as will be suggested)\nhad been shattered by the events of 1917\u201318.76\n72 See for example D. Johnson, \u2018Judicial regulation and administrative control : customary law and\nthe Nuer, 1898\u20131954\u2019, Journal of African History, 27 (1986), pp. 59\u201378.\n73 See for example Stevenson, The Nuba people, pp. 6\u201315; G. Baumann, National integration and local\nintegrity : the Miri of the Nuba Mountains in the Sudan (Oxford, 1987), pp. 9, 31\u201358.\n74 According to Nadel there really was a \u2018Great Kujur\u2019 in Dilling, though nowhere else : The Nuba,\npp. 420\u20131, 441.\n75 R.

This was patrilineally inherited in the case of the rain-maker (who claimed\nrain-making power for the whole of Nyima) and obtained through non-inherited\nand unpredictable possession in the case of \u2018hill-spirits \u2019 and some human spirits.77\nThe powers given by such spirits might be specific to a certain disease, but usually\nthey involved an ability to affect the health and fertility of wider groups \u2013 either a\n\u2018hill \u2019, or even a wider population across the hills. Performance of particular rituals\nfor fertility or against disease offered a public opportunity for the manifestation\nof a claim to such power. But it was the events associated with the movement of\nmen through the age-grade system which had apparently become, certainly by\nthe early twentieth century, spectacles in which spirit-priests of all kinds \u2013 who\nmay themselves in some cases have been quite young men \u2013 sought to claim\npower, and assert authority, over a constituency of young men rising through\nthe grades : circumcision itself was said to have been introduced to Nyima by a\nspirit-priest. Nadel\u2019s largely retrospective account of the age-grades emphasized\nthe role of spirit-priests and\/or the rain-maker in a series of events \u2013 the \u2018water\nholes \u2019 ceremony, circumcision, the \u2018beating of the bulls \u2019, the \u2018beer drinking\u2019. Only\nat the end of the cycle were young men released from obligation to these leaders.78\nIt was at this point that they would be expected to have married, and to establish\ntheir own home \u2013 whether through their own endeavours to accumulate, or\nthrough the assistance of their father or some other patron.\nRaiding could play a major part in such accumulation : some spirit-priests\nserved as prophets who advised young men on the conduct of raids against other\ncommunities, and had a claim on the spoils \u2013 livestock and people \u2013 from any raid\nthey organized. Retrospective accounts suggested a system which defined the\ninfluence of the various spirit-priests in a \u2018hierarchy of allegiances \u2019, but there are\nclear signs of competition, between different spirit-priests, and between these\nfigures and rain-makers. Accumulation in the mountains was, Nadel suggested,\nlimited by its own aims; the conspicuous consumption of wealth in displays of\ngenerosity was the ideal, and this constantly redistributed wealth. But these leaders\npursued more persistent trajectories of accumulation, in which generosity with\ncattle or grain attracted youngmenwhose service in raiding brought in newwealth,\nand allowed further human investment through the purchase of slaves.79\nSuch accumulation fitted easily into the combination of trading and raiding\nwhich characterized relations between the mountain communities and the people\nfor example as to whether the kwei kanyar (kokanyar, in Nadel\u2019s version) are initiates or initiands, andmore\nimportantly on the timing and role of the \u2018beating of the bulls \u2019 and the \u2018beer-drinking\u2019 events :\nStevenson, \u2018The Nyamang\u2019, pp. 13\u201317, SAD 795\/8\/161-82.\n77 Nadel, The Nuba, pp. 443\u20135; Stevenson, \u2018The Nyamang\u2019, p. 3, SAD 795\/8\/161-82; Stevenson,\nThe Nuba people, pp. 113\u201316.\n78 Hawkesworth, \u2018The Nuba proper\u2019, pp. 173\u20134; Nadel, The Nuba, pp. 406\u201312; Stevenson, The Nuba\npeople, pp. 100\u20133.\n79 Nadel, The Nuba, pp. 65\u20137, 163, 346, 393, 408, 412\u201313, 452; Stevenson, The Nuba people, p. 99;\nSagar, \u2018Notes on the history\u2019, p. 156.\nC O L O N I A L A U THOR I T Y I N NU B A 101\nof the surrounding plains. There was here much of the sort of interaction across\nethnic boundaries (and these were ethnic as much as racial boundaries \u2013 the\n\u2018Arabs \u2019 of the plains included many relatively recently Arabicized and incor-\nporated individuals) which has been so well described for the Rift Valley of East\nAfrica.80 The populace of the mountains produced grain, honey, tamarind, and\nslaves for trade ; they sought cattle \u2013 as a store of wealth, and as brideprice \u2013 and\nsalt from the plains, and they sought also to obtain firearms, for hunting\nand for raiding. There was a high degree of tension and violence across this\nboundary, which increased at certain times \u2013 from 1886 to 1887, and again from\n1896 to 1898 \u2013 but which always accompanied trade; the presence in the Nuba\nMountains of thousands of rifles, largely booty captured by the Mahdists from\nthe crumbling Turco-Egyptian state, provides evidence of that.81\nIn some cases trade may have provided a route to accumulation without\nraiding.82 But more widely, the linkage between organizing violence and organ-\nizing trade was a direct one; and here as elsewhere in Africa those who played both\nroles became \u2018gatekeepers \u2019, who marked their privileged access to the world\nbeyond the mountains through dress \u2013 \u2018until quite recent times, any stranger who\nappeared wearing a tagia [cap] was regarded as a \u2018\u2018 sultan\u2019\u2019 \u2019.83 In the 1880s a\nmissionary described a local \u2018khojur \u2019 in Dilling, neighbouring Nyima, and his\nenthusiasm for seeking external alliance:\nKakum was at that time a man of about fifty years of age of commanding appearance, and\ngreatly respected by the blacks. He used to wear wide white trousers and a gallabieh, and on\nhis head a nicely embroidered cap with a large tassel which our sisters had made for him.\nHe had passed his youth in Alexandria as a soldier, and acquitted himself admirably as the\nKhojur, not of Delen only, but also of the neighbouring hills. Numbers of people used to\ncome and seek his blessing and advice, and when our Bishop Comboni visited El Obeid\nhe was there to beg him to send missionaries to teach his people and make men of them.84\nWhen the British appeared \u2013 initially, as distributors of weapons which were to\nbe used against the remnants of the Mahdists \u2013 it was these men who offered\nthemselves as meks, seeing in this the possibility for access to new resources.85 \u2018Mek\nKujur is the chief of them all, and seems an intelligent man and loyal to\nthe government \u2019, reported one of the first British officers to visit Jebel Ghulfan\n80 T.

Maintaining the\nmarkers of their distinction, British officials gave men like \u2018Mek Kujur \u2019 cloth to\nwear.86\nOnce recognized as meks, these individuals found that the basis of their authority\nwas inadequate to the British expectations that they would pay tribute and end\nraids on other communities ; and complaints by administrators recurred constantly\nto the failure of meks to stop raiding by young men.87 The trajectory of violence in\nNyima exemplifies the dilemma of the meks. Agabna was the son of Arowga, one of\nthe hereditary line of shirra, or rain-makers, in the area. Arowga \u2013 or perhaps some\ncompeting accumulator \u2013 had already ensured that the people of Nyima had a\nreputation as raiders by 1902. In 1906 an officer leading a patrol of two companies\nhad decided not to try conclusions with the people of Nyima; and hadmet Arowga\nand decided that despite Arowga\u2019s claim to authority over the whole of Nyima, he\nhad no influence beyond his hill ; it was shortly after this that Agabna claimed\nthe same authority, and was given a gun \u2013 the symptomatic gift of recognition from\na coercive state.88 Agabna was then implicated in various raids, though reports\nreaching the British suggested that he had less influence in organizing these than a\nkujur called Dargol. Another kujur, Kilkun, captured in the 1908 patrol, offered a\ndescription of the genesis of one of these raids. It was planned by Irshin, another of\nArowga\u2019s sons ; he had invitedKilkun to take part, as Kilkun\u2019s spirit was believed to\noffer good guidance. When Kilkun joined in sixteen men from his hill, Kurmetti,\nfollowed him; this in itself was a success for Kilkun, who was in competition\nwith another kujur, Firoun, on the same hill.89 Some two dozenmen had also joined\nthe raid from other hills. Agabna initially shunned involvement, but changed his\nmind when he saw that all the \u2018fighting men\u2019 from his hill were going to take part.\nKilkun and his followers shared seven cattle captured in the raid \u2013 out of a total\nbooty of ten cattle and three people. These were particularly useful to Kilkun since\nhe had recently been taken hostage while \u2018visiting \u2019 another hill, and had had to pay\nnine cattle to secure his freedom.90 The picture that emerges here is of rival\n86 Appendix, SIR No. 83, June 1901, PRO FO 78\/5167; Wheatley, diary, 14 Feb. 1912, SAD 703\/3\/\n1-65; Savile, \u2018Travels in Kordofan and Darfur \u2019, 27 Jan. 1910, SAD 427\/7\/1-150.\n87 \u2018Draft Kordofan annual report, 1908\u2019, SAD 701\/25\/191;Wheatley, diary, 10 Feb. 1912, SAD 703\/\n3\/1-65; see also \u2018Operational order No. 2\u2019 with Smith, \u2018Report on Patrol No. 32\u2019, SAD 643\/13\/1-47.\n88 For the shirra, rain-maker, see Stevenson, The Nuba people, p. 117, and Nadel, The Nuba, pp. 452\u20133;\nextract from a report by Major O\u2019Connell, quoted in GGR, 1902, p. 50; Kordofan annual report, 1906,\nSAD 701\/25\/170-9; Lloyd, \u2018Notes on jebel Nyima\u2019, SAD 701\/25\/235-9.\n89 Lloyd to civil sec., 10 Nov. 1908, SAD 701\/25\/251-2; \u2018Statement of kujur Kilkun\u2019, 18 Nov. 1908,\nSAD 701\/25\/303-4.

Most of the many claimants to authority across the Nuba Mountains\noperated on a similarly small scale : a report in 1908 listed more than 300 meks and\nkujurs, most of whom claimed a score or two of \u2018rifles \u2019.91\nFor a little while, some meks were able to continue their role as dual organizers of\nviolence and organizers of trade. They supplied grain to British administrators, and\nthey were always ready to provide \u2018 friendlies \u2019 in support of British patrols against\nother mountain communities, for which officers were appropriately grateful (while\ndeprecating the tendency of the \u2018 friendlies \u2019 to \u2018 loot a pig and belt home at once\u2019).92\nBut to prevent petty raids by their young men, or even worse, to hand over raiders\nfor punishment outside the community, would destroy themeks\u2019 influence, and they\nreadily reported their conflicts with young men on this : \u2018young men \u2026 objected\nto the arrangement made with the Governor, to apprehend thieves and send them\nin to Government \u2019.93 Confronted with accusations of harbouring thieves and\nmurderers, meks sometimes challenged British officials to demonstrate their own\nability to assert authority against younger men who \u2018 in the most obstinate manner\npossible, refused to comply with the Government demands\u2019. \u2018They complained\nthey were unable to restrain their young men and asked me to speak to them. \u201994\nThe encounters between meks and touring administrators, which provided the\nprinciple public space for the enactment of the relationships of colonial authority\nin the period up to the mid-1920s, reflected the tensions of the relationship. When\nin 1914 British officials tried to persuade Mek Nimr of Jebel Mandal to accede to\ntheir demands, \u2018many of the young Nubas gathered round\u2019 and negotiations\nfoundered.95 At such meetings, meks and administrators each paraded their armed\nfollowings, as the back drop to a process of negotiation in which administrators\nsought to extract tribute and the surrender of fugitives, and meks sought to con-\nfirm their role as intermediaries but avoid being forced into disciplining their\nfollowings. Agabna was eventually unable to sustain this balancing act.\nAgabnawas seized in advance of the 1908 patrol and led around, bound, with the\ntroops ; the real aim of the patrol was Dargol.When it proved impossible to capture\nDargol or force his surrender, the patrol contented itself with destroying crops\nand houses. This was apparently sufficient to undermine Dargol\u2019s reputation; in\nthe wake of the raid the people of Sultan \u2013 the followers of Arowga, or Agabna, or\nhis brother Irshin \u2013 evidently expected to regain their local pre-eminence. Agabna\nwas subsequently implicated in more raids, and was arrested and briefly sent to\nOmdurman.

Agabna\u2019s final surrender followed the\nintervention of another local kujur, Nimr, who persuaded some of Agabna\u2019s\nfollowers to desert, and so convinced Agabna that resistance was futile ; his\nreward was a \u2018robe of honour\u2019 and \u00a3E100.97\nUnsurprisingly, Agabna\u2019s judicial murder, and this further demonstration of\n\u2018 the power of the Government \u2019, did not in itself make meks any more able to fulfil\nthe demands of administrators \u2013 though it revealed clearly enough the penalties\nfor failing to do so. There were no further large-scale patrols in Nyima (though\nthere were in neighbouring hills, where men wanted for raids continued to find\nrefuge) ;98 but the real transformation in authority did not come until the early\n1930s, when a process began which was to turn one of several meks recognized in\nNyima into the \u2018paramount \u2019 for the whole Nyima range, with a new focus of\nauthority.\nV I\nThe introduction of courts in the Nuba Mountains followed wider policy in the\nCondominium.99 Lesser headmen, designated sheikhs, were given minor courts\nable to issue fines ; courts of meks sitting \u2018 in council \u2019 with sheikhs and selected older\nmen had the authority to judge more important cases ; and wider courts com-\nposed of several meks sitting together could hear cases from several communities.\nThis would remove the district administration from involvement in all but the\nmost serious cases.100\nGillan, architect of the \u2018Nuba renaissance \u2019, insisted that this court system would\nrevive \u2018 tribal authority \u2019, but his courts were entirely remote from former local\npractice (or, as he would put it, \u2018authentic Nuba culture \u2019), which was as polycentric\nin the settlement of disputes as in everything else.

Across the Nuba\nMountains, a determined policy of court amalgamation and federation steadily\nreduced the number of meks during the 1930s, and further bound those who\nremained together in co-operation.103\nIn Nyima, a combined court was created in 1931, under Mek Amina Derdimma\n(whose name is also recorded as Dardimi and Dardimalla), the son of one of sev-\neral men who had formerly competed for authority as kujurs on Salara hill. He\ncombined his mekship with a steady building up of his own household resources,\nand he had eight wives in 1939, and more than fifteen in 1947. The jurisdiction of\nhis court expanded geographically with the creation of the \u2018Nyamang Confed-\neration\u2019 in 1939, so that he became in effect the \u2018Paramount \u2019 mek of Nyima. It also\ngrew socially, moving steadily into more and more aspects of domestic accumu-\nlation : inheritance, adultery, bridewealth, theft, and compensation.104 This was\npartly because of the growing demands of the state (so that Amina found him-\nself involved in disputes over which parent should decide whether a girl could go\nto school), but presumably also reflected the desire of men like himself to find\naffirmation of their claims on the property and bodies of others.105 Courts here, as\nelsewhere in Africa, provided a focus for an authority based on accommodation\nbetween male household heads and colonial administrators.106 A change in the tax\n101 Gillan, \u2018Devolution and native administration in Nuba Mountains province\u2019, 8 Mar. 1927, SAD\n723\/6\/15-22; Nadel, The Nuba, pp. 127, 246\u20137, 250, 459; Stevenson, \u2018The Nyamang of the southern\nKordofan hills \u2019, p. 21, SAD 795\/8\/161-82.\n102 Gillan, Some aspects, pp. 15\u201318; Hawkesworth, \u2018The Nuba proper\u2019, p. 195.\n103 Bell, diary, 13 July 1934, SAD698\/7\/61; Bell to \u2018Mother andDad\u2019, 14Dec. 1934 and 15Mar. 1935,\nSAD 697\/13\/8-10 and 45-6.\n104 Ibrahim, The dilemma of British rule, p. 22; Nadel, The Nuba, pp. 113, 127\u20138, 255, 315, 402, 453, 472;\nRachel Hassan, Journal, Tour B, 19 Nov. 1947, SAD G\/\/S 1121; Stevenson, \u2018The Nyamang of the\nsouthern Kordofan hills \u2019, SAD 795\/8\/161-82; Bell, diary, 18 Dec. 1934, SAD 698\/7\/131; Bell to\n\u2018Mother andDad\u2019, 14 Nov. 1934, SAD 697\/12\/69-71 ; Owen to Father, 3 Sept. 1940, SAD 414\/11\/82-4;\nOwen to Mother, 7 Dec. 1941, SAD 414\/12\/64-5 ; by 1933, the (incomplete) official statistics suggested\nthat Nuba courts handled 1,200 criminal and 500 civil cases in a year : GGR, 1933, p. 128.\n105 Rachel Hassan, Journal, Tour B, 18 July 1948, SADG\/\/S 1121; \u2018Salara local administration\u2019, 31\nJan. 1939, SAD 795\/8\/122-4 ; \u2018Native administration in Kordofan\u2019, 11 Nov. 1938, SAD 795\/8\/117-26;\nRachel Hassan, Journal, Tour C, 8 Oct. 1950 SAD G\/\/S 1121.

A poll tax replaced the former collective tribute, and now\nindividualmen could be held responsible for tax default and fined by the court, with\nthe result that their property could be seized and sold to wealthier neighbours.\nBy 1942, the court was clearly established in themountains as the locus of authority ;\nin one case, rivals for a mekship fought for physical control of the court-house\nitself.107\nThe courts \u2013 and the meks and men who sat in them \u2013 had a new coercive force\nto uphold their decision: the \u2018chiefs\u2019 police \u2019. It is not clear howmany of these there\nwere : Gillan\u2019s initial plans were for a force of only a few dozen, but he also\ninsisted that these police should be employed and paid directly by the meks and\nsheikhs, and that \u2018nor does it matter much to us, for instance, in the case of a Sheikh\nwho is allocated two police at 75 PT [piastres] if he actually appoints three at\n50 PT\u2019; in 1933 one mek was able to supply an escort of half a dozen men from his\n\u2018bodyguard\u2019.108The physical trappings of the post \u2013 a uniform in some hills, metal\nbadges in others, the key to the \u2018 lock-up\u2019 in which the mek detained the defiant \u2013\nmarked their authority as derived from association with the government.109\nAs a spectacle, the court stressed order, deference to age, and the association of a\nstratum of elder men with external forms and markers of authority. Photographs\nshow meks, sheikhs, and advisers in the white gowns and turbans of Arabicized\nriverain culture. Nadel described an \u2018 impressive court-house \u2019 elsewhere in the\nmountains, with its dais and benches and guard of police, and he wrote of\nAmina\u2019s Nyima court at greater length.110\nChiefs and elders sit around the walls of the court-house, the presiding chiefs on chairs, the\nrest on angarebs [rope and wood beds] or on mats on the floor. Litigants and witnesses are\nmade towait outside till they are summoned into the presence of the court. They are led in by\ntribal police, having left their weapons, sticks and sandals at the door \u2026 theymust stand at a\nrespectful distance from the chiefs. The discussion is calm and dignified.111\nDress and behaviour around Amina\u2019s court and office at Salara evoked not Nuba\nessentialism but the routine culture of petty authority typical of the wider colonial\nstate in northern Sudan: a European visitor in 1945 found here no \u2018picturesque\u2019\nnudity, but rather \u2018a sort of Government office, a very small room and a larger one\nwith a dais in it \u2019; those around were \u2018ordinarymen dressed in the long white cotton\nclothes that the Sudanese usually wear \u2019.

One was the widespread experience of military service among a generation\nof men; another was the availability of new paths to accumulation, which changed\nformer patterns of generational conflict and co-operation ; the third was the ef-\nfective collapse of the public events through which ritual authority had beenmade.\nIn Nyima, this last factor was of especial importance. The 1917\u201318 patrol, and\nthe removal of young men, had irreversibly changed the public spectacle of age-\ngrade events. The initiation which should have taken place in 1918 never hap-\npened; there were over the next two decades a series of delayed and disjointed\nrituals, but the very confusion in descriptions of these in the 1930s suggests how far\npractice, and memory, had become uncertain. Spirit-priests and rain-makers\nsought to revive these rituals under their control ; young men, many of whom were\nnow circumcized individually before setting off to find work outside Nyima, were\npressured to take part in such rituals on their return. But the ceremonies became\nmore and more erratic and infrequent \u2013 and were increasingly disapproved of\nby meks.113 Other ritual events in which spirit-priests were involved \u2013 cyclical\nagricultural rites, and special ceremonies for health \u2013 continued, but in these\nthe spirit-priests faced more directly the competition of lineage spirits, and of\nofferings by individual household heads.114\nThe court usurped the role of the age-grade rituals as public events in which\nauthority was made. It was the seizure of youngmen for military service which had\ndisrupted the former cycle of public age rituals ; and it was this seizure too which\nwas to produce a generation of men who were willing and able to seize on the\nroutine of the court as a new public event of authority. From the beginning,\nforcible recruitment \u2013 a policy which had evident links with previous practices\nof military slavery, under Turco-Egyptian rule \u2013 had been seen by the British as\na desirable spin-off of patrols against the Nuba Mountains. Policy was to replace\nEgyptian soldiers with Sudanese, but few were willing to volunteer, and forcible\nrecruitment could fill the gap.115 The 500 young men taken by Patrol No. 32 were\nan unusually large haul ; but there was otherwise nothing exceptional about this,\n112 Beasley, Journal, Apr. 1945, SAD 204\/10\/2-5; Beasley to \u2018Sheila\u2019, 24 June 1945, SAD 657\/6\/\n20-36; Trimingham, \u2018The Nuba and Islamic penetration\u2019, n.d. 1942, CMS Nuba Mountains, sub-files\n3\u20136; for Amina and Islam, see Nadel, The Nuba, p. 485.\n113 Stevenson, \u2018The Nyamang of the southern Kordofan hills \u2019, SAD 795\/8\/161-82, pp. 12\u201317; cf.\nNadel, The Nuba, pp. 406\u201312; Stevenson, The Nuba, pp. 100\u20131, 103.

The total population of Nyima at the time was\nprobably less than 30,000; for 500 to be taken off in a single year suggests a very\nsubstantial impact, and many of these ex-soldiers were to return to the hills after a\nfew years.116 In 1935 missionaries of the Church Missionary Society, arriving in\nNyima for the first time, were very conscious of the impact of these returning\nsoldiers : \u2018 they were our standby and friends and links with the people, they\nknew the kind of Arabic we knew \u2026 and understood something of English ways \u2019.\nWhen the governor came to visit the mission\u2019s new church, the behaviour of the\nfollowers of one sheikh revealed their training : \u2018The men were standing in two files\noutside the Church with Konia [the sheikh] in front. As the Governor approached\nhe received a sharp military and unrehearsed salute. \u2019117\nThe creation of such a group had been foreseen \u2013 indeed desired \u2013 by some of\nthe enthusiasts of forced recruitment, for whom this was one more way of dis-\nplaying the \u2018power of the Government\u2019: \u2018young men come back \u2026 smart well-\ndressed soldiers who know and have seen the power of the Government at\nKhartoum etc. and can tell their pals to behave\u2019.118 The peak of the \u2018Nuba\nrenaissance \u2019 had seen an attempt to stop any enlistment in the army (or at least to\nrestrict this to a special Nuba unit), lest service undermine traditional authority ;\nbut even at that time Amina, an Arabic-speaking ex-soldier fond of wearing white\nrobes and white plimsolls, could become principal mek of Nyima.119 By the early\n1940s some British administrators insisted that military service, not tradition,\nproduced the kind of meks that were needed: \u2018[A] bit of army or police work\nseems to put some discipline and glimmering of sense into Nuba and sends them\nback to their jebels as better citizens and possible leaders. \u2019120\nEx-soldiers thus became increasingly common as meks and sheikhs across the\nNubaMountains in the 1930s, selected in a processwhich had developed into a kind\nof semi-rigged and restricted ballot, conducted in public meetings overseen by the\ndistrict commissioner at which a crowd of men would express their preferences\nfrom a limited list drawn up the DC in consultation with favoured men.121\n116 Gillan, \u2018Report on the Tira el Akhdar patrol \u2019, 8 Nov. 1922, SAD 723\/4\/13-18; R.

It was the influence of these men which the\nmissionaries repeatedly noted in Nyima in the 1930s : \u2018We feel like royalty when we\nenter a village. The Sheikh is immediately informed and cigarettes, water, eggs\nand milk arrive and the floor is swept \u2026 Gau [ex-soldier and sheikh] and the\nNuba police look after us like their own children. \u2019123 The perception of shared\ninterests among these men allowed the courts to work, as a DC explained of\nAmina\u2019s court (in a language far removed from that of tradition) : \u2018The strength\nof Amina lies in his capacity to act as a chairman of a meeting. \u2019124\nThe possibility of migrant labour had presented a new challenge for heads of\nhouseholds : how to control the impact of a new access to wealth. Young men had\nnow a route to accumulation for themselves that lay beyond both the kujurs and\ntheir own fathers : instead of raiding, or herding cattle and cultivating, they could\ngo to work for wages far from the mountains, as voluntarily enlisted police or\nsoldiers, as cotton pickers, or in the growing urban economy. By 1950, migrancy\nrates among Nyimang young men were running from 15 to 35 per cent.125 At the\nsame time, official encouragement of cotton cultivation, and the growth of a cash\nmarket for simsim, grain, and a variety of lesser items, from chickens to onions,\nprovided new opportunities for those who could control land and the labour of\nyounger men and women.126Cotton production grew extraordinarily in the 1930s ;\nproduction of grain for the market also grew, and more consistently.127 Labour\nresources, as Nadel observed, were the key determinant which decided whether a\nhousehold could plant cotton.128 The early 1930s saw vigorous debate across the\nNubaMountains over wage labour and household labour: \u2018our sons \u2026 now think\nnot of farm work but of money\u2019, lamented older men (though they too were\nthinking of money).129 British observers regarded this debate as an attempt to\nmaintain tradition in the face of commerce ; but the repeated complaints of mar-\nried men that their sons refused to cultivate for them and preferred to work\n122 Stevenson, \u2018The Nyamang of the southern Kordofan hills \u2019, SAD 795\/8\/161-82, 2.\n123 Letter from Elfrida Whidborne, Feb. 1935, SAD 813\/8\/17.\n124 Broadbent, \u2018Salara local administration\u2019, 31 Jan. 1939, SAD 795\/8\/122-4.\n125 Nadel, The Nuba, pp. 40, 77 ; Stevenson, The Nuba people, p. 85.\n126 GGR, 1933, p. 123.

Daly, Imperial Sudan, p. 96,\nrecords the remarkable increase in cotton growing in the area during the 1930s : much of this crop\nwas produced by Arabs employing Nuba casual labour, but an increasing proportion \u2013 7 per cent in\n1936, but 19 per cent in 1938 \u2013 was by people officially identified as \u2018Nuba\u2019 (GGR, 1936, p. 113; GGR,\n1938, p. 113). 128 Nadel, The Nuba, p. 56.\n129 Noted in Governor-General Huddlestone\u2019s forward to Nadel, The Nuba, p. xiv.\n110 J U S T I N W I L L I S\nfor wages might better be seen as part of an attempt to establish wholly new\nprinciples for the control of wholly new opportunities for accumulation.130 By\nthe 1930s, the principal dynamic of authority in Nyima was no longer compe-\ntition between older men for followings of young raiders ; it was competition\nbetween old and young over the control of household resources, and the access\nthese offered to the accumulative opportunities of the money economy.\nAs the courts became more important as the public spaces in which authority\nwas manifested, administrators\u2019 tours lost their previous spectacular, and violent,\nair ; instead, as a DC elsewhere in the mountains noted, \u2018 [m]ost of our time has\nbeen spent sitting in Resthouses interviewing \u2018\u2018kings \u2019\u2019 and sheikhs, hearing com-\nplaints and inspecting native courts \u2019. In the course of these new, lower-key, tours\nofficials lent their support to meks and sheikhs by arresting \u2018young men\u2019 who defied\nthe judgement of the courts \u2013 and the occasional sheikh who tried to revert to a\nformer pattern by organizing a cattle raid.131 In the absence of any attempt to\nmobilize young men as a group for violence, such arrests required only minimal\nforce, for in each case there would only be one or twomiscreants : and so the ADC,\ntouring the courts, routinely found himself with a retinue of chained prisoners,\ngathered here and there from different hills.132\nIn place of the militarized \u2018 tour \u2019 there was an annual \u2018Gathering\u2019 in each sub-\ndistrict, to which allmeks and sheikhs would be summoned. The sameADC regarded\nthese by the 1930s as an opportunity to show off his mastery of a picturesque and\nonce-turbulent populace : \u2018we want [the governor-general] to realise how fierce\nour \u2018\u2018parishioners \u2019\u2019 are, and we shall do our best to make them well drunk\nbeforehand! \u2019 Banking, one presumes, on the thrilling effects of all that nakedness,\nhe also treated the event as the opportunity for an attempt (unsuccessful, it turned\nout) to seduce the governor-general\u2019s daughter. When an accidentally discharged\nrifle killed a participant at the gathering, the case was referred to a court for\nsettlement.133 All this was very far from the tense theatres of violence in which meks\nand officials had met only two decades earlier.\nV I I\nThe transition was gradual, and it was not total : the British did not succeed in\ncreating a \u2018decentralized despotism\u2019 in Nyima. Clearly, not all had equal access to\nthe new instruments of authority, and conflicts continued between elder men, as\nwell as between young and old. The right to control resources and to accumulate\nwas still contested; and ideas of well-being in particular still offered multiple\n130 Hawkesworth, \u2018The Nuba proper\u2019, p. 199; Nuba Mission Pamphlet No. 5, Apr. 1936, SAD 813\/\n8\/29-34.\n131 Bell to \u2018Mother andDad\u2019, 2Dec. 1933, 14 Jan., 12Mar. 1934 and 22Aug. 1934, SAD697\/11\/15-16,\nSAD 697\/11\/32-34 and 55-59; SAD 697\/12\/27-28.\n132 Bell to \u2018Mother andDad\u2019, 1Nov. 193 and27Nov. 1934, SAD697\/12\/62-65andSAD697\/12\/75-6.\n133 Bell to \u2018Mother and Dad\u2019, 2 Dec. 1934, 17 Jan., 8 Feb. and 20 Feb. 1936, SAD 697\/15\/8-9,\nSAD 697\/15\/20 and \/27-8.\nC O L O N I A L A U THOR I T Y I N NU B A 111\npotential foci for authority. Manymeks and sheikhs in the 1930s and 1940s combined\nposition within the court system with other kinds of authority, such as inter-\nmediacy with spirits : in Nyima in the late 1930s four out of five meks and five out\nof thirteen sheikhs had relationships with spirits, possessory or hereditary ; Sheikh\nKonia, who sought alliance with the mission and whose subjects saluted the\ngovernor, had also a possessory spirit.134 Clothes could mark alternative roles. A\ncoloured robe was one widely recognized mark of a relationship with a possessory\nspirit ; in the 1920s it had been common practice to give (rather ill-fitting) gowns\nto those meks insufficiently distinguished to receive a \u2018robe of honour\u2019, and by\nthe 1930s white gowns became standard attire for meks and sheikhs, when meeting\nBritish officials as well as when sitting in court.135 So it was that in 1941 a district\ncommissioner encountered a sort of ideological quick-change artist :\nI found [the mek] in a sort of night gown, and he bolted like a rabbit into its burrow and\nemerged after a little with three layers of rather heavy clothes, the outer robe of which would\nhave put Joseph to shame \u2026 on my suggestion however that it might be more salubrious to\nbe lighter clad he did another bolt into his hut and reappeared starko.136\nAmina, though all descriptions of him refer to his white robes, could be just as\neclectic in other ways. Nadel noted that he had in the late 1930s acquired a new\npossessory spirit, modestly named \u2018The Whole of the World \u2019, whose arrival had\nbeen associated with dreams of cars, telegraph poles, district commissioners, and\nother \u2018emblems ofWestern civilisation\u2019; Amina graciously concurred with Nadel\u2019s\nsuggestion that perhaps this was a British spirit.137 Events in Nyima revealed just\nhowmuch Amina \u2013 like other meks \u2013 was involved in lengthy and complex trials of\nstrength with possessors of various forms of ritualized power over well-being.138\nIn July 1952, after a prolonged dry spell, Mek Amina summoned a meeting at\nhis court-house, the focal point of his authority. A mission worker described\nthe meeting from her particular standpoint\nMek Amina stood up and harangued the people saying that it was because the people would\nnot leave their old ways of believing in kujurs and refused to walk in the new ways of\nChristianity or Islam that the rain would not come.Many old men stood up in turn and told\nhow so and so had the rain and then how someone else went and fetched it from him and\nthere was a lot of talk and the old kujur Tibri had to explain why he had failed utterly to\nbring the rain. Then Mek Amina sent them all outside to decide if they wanted to walk in\ntheir old ways or the new ways and there was a lot more talk. When they finally came back\nthey said they wanted to walk in their old ways!! So Mek Amina gave his speech all over\nagain and there was bedlam. Everyone talking and shouting at once.139\n134 Nadel,The Nuba, pp. 470\u20131; NubaMountains Prayer Fellowship Pamphlet No. 9, Feb. 1938, SAD\n813\/8\/41-6. 135 Nadel, \u2018A shaman cult \u2019 ; for gowns, see the photograph SAD 837\/7\/6.\n136 Owen to Father, 28 Oct. 1941, SAD 414\/12\/56-7. 137 Nadel, The Nuba, p. 443.\n138 Ibrahim, The dilemma of British rule, p. 22 ; for prophets, unrecognized as meks, donning rags of\narmy uniform to meet British officials, see Hawkesworth, \u2018The Nuba proper\u2019, p. 172.\n139 Rachel Hassan, Journal, Tour D, 23 July 1952, SAD G\/\/S.\n112 J U S T I N W I L L I S\nAmina\u2019s dramatic challenge can only be understood in terms of his prolonged\nstruggle with those who \u2013 like him \u2013 possessed ritual power, but had unlike him\nbeen excluded from the court. Kujur Tibri, the son of one Abishet who had\ncontended for power in the early twentieth century, was one of these ; even more\nimportant were the family of Agabna, who had continued to claim powers of rain-\nmaking, and aspired still to be the \u2018 tribal patriarchs \u2019.140 Agabna\u2019s unexpected\nreappearance in 1937 \u2013 as a possessory spirit, who seized one of his brothers \u2013\napparently prompted Amina\u2019s possession by the \u2018Whole of the World \u2019 spirit, and\nAmina had drawn on Islam, mission, and spirits as sources of authority, as well as\non his intermediacy with the state : he was always willing to turn up for public\nevents at the mission when the DC or governor visited, and hoped to learn\nEnglish from the missionaries.141 He also seems to have taken a certain delight\nin putting missionaries on the spot with difficult scriptural questions.142 In the\nwake of what was in effect a public expression of commitment to a continued\neclecticism in authority, Amina reaffirmed the multiple nature of his own claims :\n\u2018You will be interested to hear that Amina after telling his people they must\nleave their old ways ; he himself has been kujuring \u2026 Yesterday hundreds of\nwomen were working in his fields so he will bring rain. \u2019143 Amina\u2019s long balancing\nact, however, ended in failure \u2013 though not so bloodily as Agabna\u2019s had done. In\n1954, as the Condominium drew to an end, he was finally removed from office,\nthrough a combination of popular discontent and official displeasure. He was\nreplaced by the mek of Nitl, another Nyima hill \u2013 who was also a kujur.144\nV I I I\nColonial administrators produced two successive narratives of their engagement\nwith the Nuba Mountains. The first was of the importance of violence in showing\nthe authority of government and teaching \u2018 truculent mountaineers \u2019 the futility of\nresistance: \u2018 the various expeditions which have taken place there have at last\nconvinced the inhabitants that it is useless to fight against the Government\nauthority \u2019.145 The second was of the strength of tradition and cultural renaissance :\n\u2018The policy of trying to make the Nuba more self-governing helped to foster his\nancient traditions. \u2019146 But the effective administration which developed behind\n140 Stevenson, \u2018The Nyamang of the southern Kordofan hills \u2019, p. 22, SAD 795\/8\/161-82.

An awareness of the paucity of coercive\nresources which underlay the \u2018power of the Government \u2019, and an intense en-\nthusiasm for using such resources as overtly as possible when they were available\ndrove a semi-theatrical colonial violence up to 1920, and inspired occasional re-\ncourse to large-scale violence thereafter. But from 1920, a new direction to policy\nincreasingly located authority in a different kind of drama: the performance of\nthe court. In its structures, in its public displays and badges of status the admin-\nistration which developed relied upon an accommodation between elder men who\nsought to accumulate and a state which was willing to underwrite that accumu-\nlation \u2013 if necessary with violence. Two linked conclusions might be drawn from\nthe analysis of Nyima politics suggested here. The first is that CondominiumSudan\nsawmany of the same policies, and processes, as other parts of Africa under British\nrule : here as elsewhere the rhetoric of tradition concealed a reality of violence and\ninnovation. The second is that this innovation was not all-embracing, nor did it\nsimply obliterate former ideas of power and authority. The colonial institutions of\nlocal administration \u2013 in Nyima, and elsewhere \u2013 owed much of their form to\ncentralized state violence, rather than essentialism, and their culture reflected the\nforms and models of routine and discipline which characterized the wider state.\nThis culture of authority was to be carried over into the structure of the post-\ncolonial Sudan; but so too was the spiritual eclecticism of the populace of Nyima.\nThe authority of the state, and of the local leaders on whom it relied, rested on\nan accommodation which was always uncertain, and prone to collapse.\n114 J U S T I N W I L L I S\n"}
