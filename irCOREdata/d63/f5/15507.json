Using the \nliteratures of geography and sociology, it points out that the social constructionism that is \nbeing used increasingly in food studies is inadequate. Its privileging of human agency has \nled to an underestimation of the important of the materiality of foodstuffs. Three \ndimensions are proposed for a rematerialization of research on food exchange histories. \n \nKey words \nFood exchange, rematerialization, social constructionism. \n \n5,866 words \n 3 \nThe History of Food Exchanges: a New Agenda \n \nFood historians need humility. Their interpretations are necessarily based on flimsy \nevidence, usually without direct information on intentionality in cooking and eating. \nThose who would use old recipe books, for instance, cannot be sure that these are any \nmore than aspirational for the cooks concerned. The same elusive slipperiness is true of \ninventories and menu cards \u2013 what exactly do they represent for everyday lives and \nordinary consumption? How, then, should we characterise food and foodways in the light \nof the sparse and inconsistent data available to us?  \nThe answer in recent scholarship has been to emphasise social constructionism. \nBorrowed from the sociology of science and technology, this argues that objective reality \nis not self-evident and that there are traces of human intervention in even the most \n\u201cnatural\u201d of objects and environments. One example might be that even products such as \nmilk are fully in the human realm, not only as a result of husbandry practices and the \nselection of the breed of cow, but also due to methods of standardising the butterfat \ncontent and heat treatment to kill pathogens.\n1\n A second example is the so-called \u201ctypical\u201d \nfoods that are associated with particular regions, such as Parma ham or champagne. Some \nof these products are of such ancient pedigree that they have acquired an aura of the \ntaken-for-granted, especially in view of the loyalty of local consumers, but \nconstructionists would want to unpack the associated histories and examine the \nfingerprints of politics and social capital. Alessandro Stanziani has done this with French \nwines, for instance, showing that Appellation d\u201fOrigine Contr\u00f4l\u00e9e designations initially \narose out of defensive tactics in the face of cheap imports and problems of falsification, \nnot through any true reverence for the environmental specificity of terroir.\n2\n  \n                                                 \n1\n  Peter ATKINS, \u201cLaboratories, Laws and the Career of a Commodity,\u201d Environment & \nPlanning D:  Society & Space, vol. 25, 2007, pp. 967-989; Peter ATKINS, Liquid \nMaterialities, forthcoming, 2009. \n2\n  Alessandro STANZIANI, La Qualit\u00e9 des Produits en France, XVIII\ne\nXX\ne\n Si\u00e8cles, \nParis, 2003. \n 4 \nSocial constructionism has become influential in food studies, to the extent that \nwe may be losing sight of the rawness of the raw material, the food. So, the time has \ncome for a sceptical critique. The present paper seeks to do this through a call for a \ngreater consideration of material histories than has so far been evident. As such, it is not \nan anti-constructionist manifesto but, rather, an attempt to demonstrate that alternatives \nlie in the stuff of foodstuffs. First, I will look at material potentialities and resistances in \norder to foreground genes, metabolisms and compositional properties. Second, I want to \nsuggest a networked understanding of food qualities. This will help us to grasp the part-\nhuman, part-object character of food systems. Linked to this, I suggest, are the concepts \nof trust and civilization. Third, we will discover that material disorder is an under-\nappreciated component of food exchange. \nAll of this is predicated on the assumption of an indeterminate ontological \npolitics, a terminology that is derived from the ethnography of objects and their \nassociated knowledges undertaken by Annemarie Mol. She asserts that \u201contology is not \ngiven in the order of things \u2026 instead, ontologies are brought into being, sustained, or \nallowed to wither away in common, day-to-day, socio-material practices\u201d.3 In her world \nof hospitals, there are diseases and instruments and knowledges associated with their \ndiagnosis and treatment, and these knowledges are enacted through practical, material \nevents. She advocates attempts to study the multiplicity of material reality, and she \ndismisses social constructionism, which shows little interest in the fragility of object \nidentity. For her, \u201cmatter isn\u201ft as solid and durable as it sometimes appears\u201d4 and for us \nthis is equally as applicable to food studies as it is to her interest in the diagnosis of \ndiseases such as atherosclerosis.\n5\n Take wheat, tomatoes or beef, for instance. Until \n                                                 \n3\n  Annemarie MOL, The Body Multiple: Ontology in Medical Practice, Durham, NC, \n2002, p. 6. \n4\n  John LAW and Annemarie MOL, \u201cNotes on Materiality and Sociality,\u201d Sociological \nReview, vol. 43, 1995, pp. 274 294. \n5\n  Annemarie MOL, \u201cOntological Politics: a Word and Some Questions, in J. LAW and J. \nHASSARD (eds) Actor Network Theory and After, Oxford, 1999, pp. 74 89; A. MOL \nand J. MESMAN, \u201cNeonatal Food and the Politics of Theory: Some Questions of Method,\u201d \n 5 \nrelatively recently these and other food commodities were of many different varieties, \ntastes, and degrees of perishability, so that both substance and quality were to a degree \nunpredictable through time and across space. This unruly behaviour of material was at the \nroot of the difficulties in arranging inter-continental shipments of bananas or frozen meat \nuntil the second half of the nineteenth century. Knowing foods and understanding their \npotential for management has been continuously problematic. Technological \ninterventions have become substitutes for organic processes, but this has been mainly in \ndomains of simplification. Thus, uncertainty can be reduced by bringing a \u201cknown\u201d \nvariety under close scrutiny and control, in the way that McDonald\u201fs uses only a few \nvarieties of potato (Russet Burbank, Shepody) for its fries and the world banana industry \nhas invested mainly in one cultivar, the Cavendish. \nOntological politics are also to be found in the kitchen. Cooks do not always \nfollow the recipe and anyway they cannot reproduce their ingredients and methods \nexactly on every occasion. My Chicken Madras is therefore an indeterminate cluster of \npotential rather than a certainty. Anyone who has eaten it will confirm that it does not \nalways live up to its potential but this is as much due to the skills, or lack of them, innate \nin practice as it is to the ingredients and the recipe. To adapt Martin Heidegger\u201fs tool \nanalysis, the properties of food are always at least partially absent and only become \n\u201cpresent at hand\u201d in one of its commonly agreed applications. Objects such as food to \nHeidegger should not be defined in terms of their properties, but rather in their systems of \nrelations. Thus bread has no \u201cessential\u201d characteristics on its own, but when it is baked, \nsold and eaten it becomes bread in the unfolding of these practices. \n \n1. Embodied Materiality \n \nI begin with genes. This may sound strange in an article about food, but the belief is \ngrowing that our ability to metabolise certain nutrients is a function of our genetic \n                                                                                                                                                 \nSocial Studies of Science, vol. 26, 1996, pp. 419 444; H. HARBERS, A. MOL and A. \nSTOLLMEYER, \u201cFood matters: Arguments for an Ethnography of Daily Care,\u201d Theory, \nCulture and Society, vol. 19, 2002, pp. 207 226. \n 6 \ninheritance. We are in a sense therefore hard-wired with benefits and disbenefits to be \nderived from particular foods. To a certain extent, we know this ourselves and avoid \nthose foods that make us feel ill. In a discussion of food exchange this will affect the \nreception of foods and the meals made of them. \nA well-known example of metabolism affecting trade is the enzyme lactase. This \nis readily produced by infants in order to draw sustenance from mother\u201fs milk. But a high \nproportion of adults in East Asian and some African countries are lacking this chemical \nmeans of digesting the milk sugar, lactose, with the result that they may get stomach \ncramps and other unpleasant side effects. Selling raw milk in these markets is therefore \ndifficult and even processed dairy products are in low demand because of their lack of \nvalue in associated food cultures. Although there is no intention here to be racially \ndeterministic, geneticists nevertheless confirm that the ability to absorb milk after the age \nof five can be traced to herding groups about 9000 or more years ago. There was a \nconveyed evolutionary advantage in this lactose-tolerance mutation, providing a possible \nexplanation for the spread of their genes, for instance to northern Europe. The allele is \nfound in 99 per cent of people of Dutch origin but only 5 per cent of Chinese. \nAccording to Nabhan, there are other genetically-related nutritional markers. \nSome are relatively benign, such as the distaste some people have for chillies or \ncruciferous vegetables.\n6\n Others can cause social breakdown, for instance the impact of \nalcohol on those whose bodies are unable to absorb it safely. A few genetic mutations and \nadaptations seem to have had remarkable consequences for health, such as the ability of \nthe natives of Crete to assimilate large quantities of olive oil, with the result that their rate \nof heart attack is 40 times lower than the average in America. This seems to be due to a \nbodily adjustment that has taken place in a relatively isolated gene pool over several \nthousand years, and unfortunately is not something that the rest of us can realistically \naspire to. \nA final comment about the body-food nexus concerns the nutrition we receive in \nthe womb. David Barker has discovered, using archives of patient histories, that there is a \n                                                 \n6\n  Gary NABHAN, Why Some Like it Hot: Food, Genes and Cultural Diversity, \nWashington DC, 2004. \n 7 \nstrong correlation between the foetal experience and disease risk in later life.\n7\n He found \nthat low birth weight is a good predictor of ischaemic heart disease, stroke and diabetes in \nadulthood, although this can be no more than an indication of susceptibility because \nmany other factors are brought to bear during an individual\u201fs lifetime. Overall then, the \nmake-up of our bodies \u2013 either genetically or because of some nutritional advantages \nacquired before birth \u2013 represents, materially-speaking, a set of constraints on the \ncultural.  \n \n2. Foodstuffs \n \nNext we will look at material resistances of foods themselves. By this I mean the bloody-\nmindedness of certain materials with regard to exchange. For example, the perishability \nof some fruits and vegetables, of fish, and of milk, has had a profound geographical \nimpact upon economy and diet. The high prices that result from the technical difficulties \nof preservation and transport have disadvantaged certain income groups. They have also \npatterned an economic geography of production and a consumption geography that \nincludes regions of lack.  \nHistorically, similar uncertainties have been associated with attempts to move \nfood plants and animals from one region to another in order to introduce new possibilities \nof production. The new growing conditions may turn out to be transgressive for \nparticularly valued species, forcing dietary and culinary adaptations for any migrant \ngroup who may have wished to reproduce their old food habits in the new home land. A \nrelatively trivial but intriguing example of this is the broad bean enclave of Canada \ndiscussed by Daniel Gade.\n8\n This vegetable was carried by French immigrants in the \nseventeenth century but it was challenged by difficult growing conditions, along with \nother favourites, such as the grape vine. Today it survives only in the Lac Saint Jean \nregion of Quebec, where the archaic Norman name gourgane is still used for what is now \n                                                 \n7\n  David BARKER (ed.) Fetal and Infant Origins of Adult Disease, London, 1992. \n8\n  Daniel GADE, \u201cEnvironment, Culture and Diffusion: the Broad Bean in Qu\u00e9bec,\u201d  \nCahiers de G\u00e9ographie du Qu\u00e9bec, vol. 38, 1994, pp. 137-150. \n 8 \nlittle more than a curiosity. This is a tiny island of cultural enthusiasm in a sea of \nindifference. The Americas have many other beans better suited to its agro-ecologies and \nto local tastes. \nAnother example is the long-run historical difficulty of knowing milk. This highly \ncomplex liquid contains roughly 100,000 types of organic molecules, most of which have \nyet to be researched in detail. There are lipids, proteins, carbohydrates in the form of milk \nsugar (lactose), and also gases and minerals. Milk is an emulsion of fat globules, a fine \ndispersion of casein micelles, a colloidal solution of globular proteins and a colloidal \ndispersion of lipoprotein particles. Over the last 200 years there have been vigorous \ndebates about the normative compositional standards that one can reasonably expect of \nmilk in its natural state, but there is such variability according to breed, feed and other \nfactors that there was plenty of scope for adulteration by creaming or watering by \nunscrupulous farmers and retailers. In short, milk has proved to be one of the most \nproblematic of foods to bring under the control of the law and state regulation. Any study \nof the milk trade or of the exchange of ideas about the consumption of milk \u2013 for instance \nits nutritional value or its role as a carrier of disease \u2013 must take this material fragility of \nthe commodity into account. \nThis raises the material issue of quality. A number of recent papers identify the \nkey dimensions of quality as: the naturalness of ingredients; qualities conferred by the \nmethod or place of production; food safety and traceability; nutritional value; \norganoleptic qualities and functionality; food\u201fs biological quality; and quality in terms of \ncertification. Food quality is part of the more general question of how people choose \nwhat to consume.  \n The notion of material quality has been undervalued in economics, to the extent \nthat Michel Callon calls it an \u201cunder-conceptualised and fragile notion\u201d.9 He therefore \nproposes an \u201ceconomy of qualities\u201d in which any object (food in our case) has shape at a \nparticular moment in its history \u2013 a cross-section of its \u201ccareer\u201d.10 This is rather different \n                                                 \n9\n  Michel CALLON, \u201cLet\u201fs Put an End on Uncertainties,\u201d in C.

RABEHARISOA, \u201cThe Economy of Qualities,\u201d \n 9 \nfrom the insights of social constructionism. Callon privileges the material and the \nqualities of goods are seen as emergent rather than designed. Quality therefore cannot be \ntaken for granted. \n \n3. Space, Trust and Civilization \n \nOne of the strongest concepts to come out of the recent food literature is that of the \nnetwork. The suggestion here is that ideas and materials circulate, not just in well-worn \nchannels between farm and urban market, but more broadly in worlds of mutual regard \nand trust. Such food exchanges then have been researched in three dimensions. \nFirst there is the fili\u00e8re or food chain concept, which looks at multiplications and \ncomplications of international food networks. Many articles have been published on the \nconcept of \u201ccontrol at a distance\u201d in the trade of raw materials from the Global South. \nBarrett and Freidberg\u201fs work on horticultural products air freighted from Africa is an \nexample.\n11\n Other research has been conducted on the part played by retailers, whose \npower seems to be growing in reach, and on circulating capitals, knowledge, and the \ngovernance of chains.  \nSecond, food exchange has been studied in work on rules and conventions.  This \nhas been a major thrust of action-oriented French pragmatism.\n12\n Starting in the 1980s, \nconventions theorists, operating in the territories of economic sociology and institutional \neconomics, have been interested in the social relations associated with production and \nexchange. As they remind us, there is much uncertainty between actors, but this can be \n                                                                                                                                                 \nEconomy and Society, vol. 31, 2002, pp. 194 217. \n11\n  Hazel BARRETT, \u201cGlobalization and the Changing Networks of Food Supply: the \nImportation of Fresh Horticultural Produce from Kenya into the UK,\u201d Transactions of the \nInstitute of British Geographers, New Series, vol. 24, 1999, pp. 159-174; Suzanne \nFREIDBERG, S., French Beans and Food Scares: Culture and Commerce in an Anxious \nAge, New York, 2004. \n12\n  F.

Conventions emerge over time through the successful \nrepetition of particular actions and may have their roots in tacit agreements, without \nwritten rules. They are shaped by the material environment of action and in turn become \na guide for future action and a form of legitimation that can be renegotiated and \nmodified.\n13\n  Institutions may also arise in the long run, for instance to deal with disputes, \nand conventions may overlap with each other or be replaced, in time, by contractual \nobligations between parties.  \nThird, there has been influential work on admiration and emulation, especially in \nthe exchange of ideas about what to eat and the manners to adopt. Drawing upon the \nfoundational work of Elias, Stephen Mennell has argued that it is possible to trace the \ntrickle down through the social hierarchy of table manners and that these can be treated \nas a surrogate of the spread of civilised behaviour.\n14\n Social difference was increasingly \nexpressed in this way. The argument can be extended to the origins and spread of \u201cgood\u201d \nfood, as served restaurants in France in the nineteenth century. More recently, the advent \nof food advertising has continued to exploit our desire to be seen to be eating the right \nfoods, for instance outdoing each other in consuming the healthiest items or those which \ndo least damage to the planet.  \nThe modern globalization of cuisines, although having its roots in the imperial \nadventures of the nineteenth century, has recently shifted a gear with the global \nexpansion of restaurant chains such as McDonald\u201fs and the spread of \u201cethnic\u201d restaurants \nin the wake of worldwide migration. The former has generated a convergence of cooking \nstyles known as McDonaldization, and the latter has introduced metropolitan populations \nin wealthy countries to an unimagined variety of dishes.\n15\n Anneke van Otterloo has \n                                                 \n13\n  L.

Van Otterloo argues that the Dutch at one \ntime or another have embraced all four positions of Warde\u201fs model of the diffusion of \nforeign and exotic foods: rejection, indigenization, restyling, and authentication.\n17\n \nIn this section I have sutured together some rather different schools of thought. \nBut the common factor is linkage or relationship, which provides a basis for \nunderstanding food exchange. One frequently proposed means of bringing the field even \ncloser together is actor network theory. Geographers and sociologists in particular have \napplied ANT to food studies and they have argued that it stands for a new way of \nresearching relational materiality. It has certainly proved to be the most popular of the \nnon-constructionist materialisms.  \n The basis of actor network theory is socio-natural hybridity. Foodstuffs can thus \nbe seen as a blend of human and non-human agency; simultaneously naturalized and \nsocialized. They are hybrids: material objects blended with human action.\n18\n Networks, \naccording the ANT theorists such as Bruno Latour, may include humans such as farmers \nand consumers; milking machines; \u201cinscription devices\u201d such as milk yield records and \nlaboratory analysis results; cows; and materials like railway wagons and delivery carts. \nThese are joined together in alliances that vary in strength and persistence.

Actor network theory is not really about spatially discrete networks \nin the sense of a sewage or a telephone system, nor is it structural as with a social network. \nA better metaphor is said to be the rhizome, which spreads itself unseen under the soil. \nHybrids and networks are in a constant state of becoming, as a result of the process of \n\u201ctranslation\u201d. One result of translation is the creation of \u201cmixtures between entirely new \ntypes of beings, hybrids of nature and culture\u201d.19 \nA recent series of articles by Becky Mansfield illustrates the potential of a \nnetworked view of food exchange. She stressed the biophysicality of the food supply \nchains of fish and fish products (catfish and surimi). Her task is to understand how \ndefinitions of quality emerge in specific economic contexts. Rather than making a general \ndistinction between nature and society or arguing for socially constructed quality, she \nlooks at individual production networks in order \u201cto understand how specific aspects of \nwhat we call \u201cthe natural world\u201d participate in particular interactions\u201d.20 Her idea of \nquality is different because she argues that it arises from assemblages of practices within \ncommodity chains. These chains have particular histories that have established sets of \nrelations and the commodities are differentiated as a result.  \nMansfield uses the spatial metaphors of distancing and entanglement to \nunderstand the trajectories of fish products in their commodity chains. She looks in \nparticular at surimi, a Japanese fish paste which is a mixture of fish protein and starch. \nBecause of its physical characteristics, surimi has a wide range of functionality, including \nproducts such as \u201ckrab\u201d sticks (artificial crab). It can be made from a number of different \n                                                 \n19\n  Bruno LATOUR, We Have Never Been Modern, New York, 1993, p. 10. \n20\n  Becky MANSFIELD, \u201cFish, Factory Trawlers, and Imitation Crab: the Nature of \nQuality in the Seafood Industry,\u201d Journal of Rural Studies, vol. 19, 2003, pp. 9 21; \nBecky MANSFIELD, \u201cSpatializing Globalization: a \u201eGeography of Quality\u201f in the \nSeafood Industry,\u201d Economic Geography, vol. 79, 2003, pp. 1\u201316; Becky MANSFIELD \nB., \u201c\u201eImitation crab\u201f and the material culture of commodity production,\u201d Cultural \nGeographies, vol. 10, 2003, pp. 176\u2013195. \n 13 \nfish species and so can be produced in many countries. Quality is based on fish biology, \nprocessing technologies, mouthfeel (texture, chewyness), whiteness, and the nature of the \nfinal product. Such issues can be dealt with at the local level and overseen by \ntransnational food corporations, making this a food with a global reach. \n Mansfield\u201fs conclusion is interesting, that \u201ceconomic activities materialize \nmeanings\u201d.21 She insists that quality is relational. It is \u201cneither a subjective judgment \n(what different people like), nor an objective measure (the characteristics of a \ncommodity), but instead it is produced within relations of commodity production and \nconsumption\u201d. \n \n4. Order and Disorder \n \nIn this last section of the paper I will continue with my argument that material resistances \nhave significantly influenced food exchange. Here the emphasis will be upon institutional \ncontexts in which cheating, disorder and conflict play a part. The first sub-theme is that \nof falsification and adulteration. This has been an important factor affecting food choices \nin the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, to be replaced since then by concerns \nabout food additives. Accum\u201fs Treatise on Adulteration of Food and Culinary Poisons \nwas the first to catch the public imagination in Britain.\n22\n He established the idea, later \nfollowed up by Hassall in the 1850s, that many foods were either falsified to give them \nthe appearance of quality, for instance by the addition of dies that were toxic, or \nadulterated in order to stretch the supply and so increase profit levels.  \nFrench consumers were equally exposed to dishonest foods, as made clear in \nChevallier\u201fs inventory of sharp practice in his Dictionnaire des Alt\u00e9rations et \nFalsifications.\n23\n Gradually, as more and more evidence of adulteration was uncovered, \n                                                 \n21\n  Becky MANSFIELD, \u201cFrom Catfish to Organic Fish: Making Distinctions about \nNature as Cultural Economic Practice,\u201d Geoforum, vol. 34, 2003, pp. 329 342. \n22\n  Fredrick ACCUM, A Treatise on Adulteration of Food and Culinary Poisons...and the \nMethods of Detecting Them, London, 1820. \n23\n  J.-B.A. CHEVALLIER, Dictionnaire des Alt\u00e9rations et Falsifications des Substances \n 14 \nthere was a crisis of confidence among consumers and among traders purchasing from \neach other. The second half of the nineteenth century saw the establishment of local \nauthority and state laboratories and sampling regimes in most European countries, and \nalso the introduction of legislation.\n24\n This became an age of measurement and \nsurveillance, although the early phase of food science was characterised by a lack of \nepistemological consensus and by debate among numerous, conflicting interest groups. \nUnder the circumstances of widespread uncertainty, it is not surprising that reassurance \nwas sought in branded goods, with food suppliers and retailers of reputation, and with \nthose foods that were easiest to control. Where a commodity, such as milk, proved to be \nproblematic \u2013 I am including here its role in the spread of epidemic disease \u2013 demand \ncontinued to be restrained despite increased spending power and better standards of living \nbefore the First World War.  \nThe degree of material anarchy implicit in the account above suggests that social \nconstructionism, with its over-confident attribution of human agency, cannot be the full \nstory. Andrew Pickering picks this point up in his book The Mangle of Practice.\n25\n He \ndevelops a \u201cdialectics of resistance and accommodation\u201d, and so moves away from the \nstronger versions of social constructionism and their sociological fundamentalism. \nInstead he sees society\u201fs institutions muddling along and adapting to the messy situations \nthat arise. He wants to acknowledge non-human agency and to stress its performative \n                                                                                                                                                 \nAlimentaires, M\u00e9dicamenteuses et Commerciales, Paris, 2 vols, 1850-1852. \n24\n  Peter ATKINS and Alessandro STANZIANI, \u201cFrom Laboratory Expertise to \nLitigation.

The particular \u201cmangle\u201d that Pickering has studied in greatest depth \nis science and technology, for instance in the nineteenth century chemical dye industry in \nBritain.  The discovery of the new dye, mauve, in the 1850s was revolutionary but it was \nunexpected. Pickering\u201fs analysis of this early example of technoscience shows \u201cthe \nirreducibility of material performances to the social\u201d.26 Physical and chemical properties \nwere the key, and harnessing them was far from straightforward.  \nGeographers have been making similar arguments about the recent history of food \nscares. David Goodman\u201fs crie de c\u0153ur is that \u201contology matters.\u201d27 His point is that an \nappreciation of the active capacity of material is crucial to an understanding of the \npresent crisis of confidence about food safety, particularly with respect to animal foods. \nMichel Callon has called this counter-performativity of material an \u201coverflowing\u201d.28 We \nneed to look no further than \u201cmad cow disease\u201d and the many other food-borne infections \nto see that unpredicted crises occur from time to time.\n29\n So \u201clively\u201d has this and other \nzoonoses \u2013 such as E. coli O157, salmonella in eggs, and bird flu \u2013 been that Ulrich Beck \nhave suggested that they are representative of a new historical era, the Risk Society. First, \nthe scale of catastrophe is said to be beyond anything previously witnessed. Second, the \nimpact has been global, crossing borders in an way that increasingly seems to be \nuncontrollable. Third, the authority of science and of the political process is said to have \nbeen undermined, and there has been a loss of credibility in official public health \nmessages related to food. \n                                                 \n26\n  Andrew PICKERING, \u201cDecentring Sociology: Synthetic Dyes and Social Theory,\u201d \nPerspectives on Science, vol. 13, 2005, pp. 352 405. \n27\n  David GOODMAN, \u201cOntology Matters: the Relational Materiality of Nature and \nAgro-Food Studies,\u201d Sociologia Ruralis, vol. 41, 2001, pp. 182 200. \n28\n  Michel CALLON, \u201cWhat Does it Mean to Say that Economics is Performative?\u201d \nWorking Paper 5, Centre de Sociologie de l\u201fInnovation, Ecole des Mines de Paris, 2006. \n29\n  Peter ATKINS, \u201cFear of Animal Foods: a Century of Zoonotics,\u201d Appetite, vol. 51, \n2008, pp. 18-21. \n 16 \nAn example of Pickering\u201fs mangle from my own research on water quality is the \nproblem of the arsenic contamination of the groundwater in Bangladesh.\n30\n In the 1970s \nmany infants and children there were dying from diarrhoeal diseases caught from \ndrinking unclean water from ponds and rivers. This prompted an admirable response \nfrom the international community encouraging the drilling of tube wells down to aquifers \nin the sediment where the water was of a much higher quality microbially. What no-one \nanticipated was that this water carried a small but deadly load of arsenic, which over the \nsubsequent decades has been responsible for internal cancers and skin conditions, putting \ntens of millions of people at risk. Geochemists have responded to this emergency, which \nincidentally is said to be the world\u201fs largest environmental health catastrophe, by \npublishing thousands of scientific papers on the chemical processes behind the release of \narsenic, and there is also a growing social science literature of this \u201crelease\u201d of mortality \nand morbidity by human intervention. The disaster has led to advances in field \nmeasurement and in technologies of mitigation on the back of research funding that \nwould not have been justified otherwise, and here we have a mangle of scientific and \nadministrative practice that was a surprise to everyone concerned, with outcomes that are \nstill difficult to anticipate in the immediate future. The situation in Bangladesh gives the \nimpression of an underground world that cannot be dominated, and which has shaken the \nself-confidence of all of the experts involved, including those who recommend models of \ngovernance to cope with the vast scale of the hazard. \nA final manifestation of disorder is conflict. Here we could talk here about the \nhistory of bread riots and the ability of hungry people to bring about change, but I prefer \n                                                 \n30\n  Peter ATKINS, Manzurul HASSAN and Christine DUNN, \u201cToxic Torts: Arsenic \nPoisoning in Bangladesh and the Legal Geographies of Responsibility,\u201d Transactions of \nthe Institute of British Geographers, New Series, vol. 31, 2006, pp. 272 285; Peter \nATKINS, Manzurul HASSAN and Christine DUNN, \u201cEnvironmental Irony: Summoning \nDeath in Bangladesh,\u201d Environment & Planning A, vol. 39, 2007, pp. 2699 2714; Peter \nATKINS, Manzurul HASSAN and Christine DUNN, \u201cPoisons, Pragmatic Governance \nand Deliberative Democracy: the Arsenic Crisis in Bangladesh,\u201d Geoforum, vol. 38, \n2007, pp. 155 170. \n 17 \nto think about the conditions of war. In her book War is Good for Babies, Deborah \nDwork argued that the different political atmosphere of the First World War made it \npossible to introduce subsidised milk for babies who in peace time might have had to go \nwithout, to the detriment of their physical condition.\n31\n A similar analysis of the Second \nWorld War would show that welfare milk and school milk were greatly increased in \nscope and that vested interests were stilled which had held up progressive pre-war action \nwith regard to adult hunger and malnutrition. British food may have been rationed in \nwartime but evidence suggests that nutrition was adequate and that food-related health \nwas relatively good. \n \n5. Conclusion: a New Agenda \n \nIt will be obvious by now that this has not been a review article looking at previous \nattempts to understand the historical geography of food exchange. I have not, for \ninstance, touched upon the substantial theme of diffusion, which interested rural \nsociologists and cultural geographers throughout the last century.\n32\n Instead I have \nindicated three dimensions of food as material that are not adequately accounted for in \nsocial constructionism. \nFirst, our bodies are maps of potentialities and resistances. In a few instances, \nsuch as lactose tolerance, this is thought to have influenced the direction of human \nevolution. For many people it makes no conscious difference to their eating lives, other \nthan the avoidance of broccoli or milk. Perhaps more significant for most of us are the \n                                                 \n31\n  Deborah DWORK, War is Good for Babies and Other Young Children:  a History of \nthe Infant and Child Welfare Movement in England, 1898-1918, London, 1987. \n32\n  P.J.

While human ingenuity \nmakes it possible to eat curry at the South Pole and ice cream in the tropics, nevertheless \nthere is a cost attached, and distance and other geographical supply factors are therefore \nscored into the foundations of food systems. Material makes a difference. \nSecond, we looked at networked visions of food exchange. In the now extensive \nliterature networks come in many guises: fili\u00e8res, commodity systems, food regimes, \nsystems of provision, value chains, and commodity circuits. They have been theorised \nvariously, including ideas about social embedding, quality conventions, and even with \nmetaphysically radical notions of the hybridization of the social and the natural. What \nmatters most here is the recognition of the significance of linkages in the study of food \nexchange. \nFinally, Pickering\u201fs \u201cmangle of practice\u201d insists upon the unpredictability and \nmessy nature of food systems. The point here is that social constructionism takes \ninsufficient account of the sometimes uncontrollable nature of material. Its focus upon \nhuman agency is partial. My own work on the history of milk has shown it to be \nproblematic in every sense, from the definition of what is an acceptable composition, \nthrough to litigation about fraud in the courts. I have found that, in the absence of \nscientific consensus, judges were called upon to decide upon the natural limits of a \nnatural commodity.  \nOverall, we need a rematerialized history of food exchange. We have surprisingly \nlittle literature about foodstuffs. There has been a welcome surge of commodity histories \nrecently on chocolate, salt, pasta, cod, peanuts, tea, spices, beans, citrus and other \nindividual commodities.\n33\n But, with a few notable exceptions, the authors say little about \n                                                 \n33\n  M.
