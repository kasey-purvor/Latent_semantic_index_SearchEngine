Introduction\nThe classical multi-frequency higher order spectra (HOS) based on the Fourier transform has been widely\ninvestigated [1-6] for nonlinearity detection in stationary temporal processes. However, for some important\napplications (e.g. radar and sonar systems, mechanical systems with transient shaft rotation, etc.) it is necessary\nto process transient temporal processes with any (i.e. linear and nonlinear) polynomial variation of the\ninstantaneous frequency. The classical HOS is not suitable for these processes because\n\uf0b7 the stationary kernel of the Fourier transform is not matched with transient processes, including\nprocesses with frequency variation in time\n2\uf0b7 averaging of HOS for the whole process duration creates estimation errors due to signal non-\nstationarity\nThe problem is to create a new HOS based on a transform with kernel matching with any polynomial time\nvariation of the instantaneous frequency. It is important to solve this problem for transient signals from radar,\nsonar and mechanical systems. This problem has not been investigated in literature.\nThe higher order chirp-Fourier transform was recently proposed and investigated in ref. [7] for the higher order\nchirps, i.e. transient signals with any polynomial variation of the instantaneous frequency. Therefore, this\ntransform is suitable for development of a new HOS.\nThe purposes of this paper are to\n\uf0b7 propose a new multidimensional time\/multi-frequency higher order spectral technique for transient signals\nwith any (i. e linear and nonlinear) polynomial variation of instantaneous frequency: the short time higher\norder chirp spectra (HOCS) based on the higher order chirp-Fourier transform and time-domain\nwindowing technique\n\uf0b7 compare the proposed HOCS with the classical multi-frequency HOS based on the Fourier transform\nThe proposed multidimensional HOCS is suitable for the above mentioned signals because\n\uf0b7 the non-traditional transient kernel of the higher order chirp-Fourier transform is suitable\nfor transient signals with any polynomial frequency variation\n\uf0b7 the time-domain windowing technique is suitable for transient nature of signals\n2.

One can use different external and internal\nwindows: e.g. rectangular, Hamming, Chebyshev, etc. The correlation between external window length and\ninternal window length could be employed from reference [3]. If the signal has fast variations, then a shorter\nexternal window )(the is required. If, according with reference [3], we maintain the internal window length to\nbe the )1( \uf02dn th root of the external window length, then the shorter internal window length is required, which\nin turn provides poorer frequency resolution. Thus, we have better time resolution and poorer frequency\nresolution. If it is desired to represent only the long term signal evolution, then it may suffice to use a longer\nexternal window. According with reference [3], the longer internal window can be used in this case which in\nturn provides better frequency resolution. Thus, we have poorer time resolution and better frequency resolution\ndue to the longer internal window\nSo, it follows from the considered basic cases that selection of the external and the internal window lengths for\nthe short time HOCS is always a trade-off between time and frequency resolutions.\nThe amount of overlapping provided by the external and internal windows could be also different. Normally,\n50% overlapping is used in the classical HOS for internal windowing in order to increase number of averaged\nsegments and avoid redundancy. It is recommended that the same amount of overlapping be used for short-\ntime HOCS. However, if signal has fast variations, then a shorter external window )(th is required; if in this\ncase one wants to maintain the same length of the internal window (i.e. the same frequency resolution) and\nnumber M of averaging, then a higher level of overlapping (e.g. 75-80%) is required. A higher level of\noverlapping for the internal windowing leads to accuracy increment of HOCS estimation; however, the level of\noverlapping around 90-95% is redundant.\n4The amount of overlapping provided by the external window depends on the required time resolution. Higher\nlevel of overlapping for the external windowing leads to increment of time resolution of HOCS analysis.\nThe short time HOCS is an )1( \uf02b\uf02b Nn dimensional function, i. e. the real and the imaginary HOCS\ncomponents, )1( \uf02dn frequencies, time and )1( \uf02dN parameters hc . It is an n dimensional (i.e. time\/ )1( \uf02dn\nfrequency) transform and generalization of the classical multi-frequency HOS based on the Fourier transform\nfor the case of transient signals with nonlinear polynomial variation of instantaneous frequency.\nPhysical significance of the proposed technique is that it uses a transform with transient (not stationary)\npolynomial kernel which is suitable for transient signals with any polynomial variation of the instantaneous\nfrequency in time.\nSuppose that the temporal transient signal )(tx is an additive mixture of )1( \uf02dn transient components )(ts j ,\nnarrowband or sinusoidal. In the practically important non-stationary case, instantaneous frequencies of these\ncomponents vary in time; frequency variations are linear and nonlinear and could be different for different\ncomponents and different parts of the signal )(tx .\nLet\u2019s consider a generic complex non-stationary component )(ts j with amplitude )(tA j and nonlinear\npolynomial variation of the instantaneous frequency in time:\n)]([2)(),( tVtFjjj\njjetAts \uf02b\uf03d \uf070 ,\nwhere )\/(...)4\/()3\/()2\/()( 44\n3\n3\n2\n2 NtCtCtCtCtV\nN\nNjjjjj \uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf03d , )(tV j is a variation function [7], jF is\nthe initial frequency, jC2 is the constant chirp rate (i.e. the frequency speed), jC3 is the constant frequency\nacceleration, Njj CC ,...,4 are the higher order constant parameters, t is time, N is an order of nonlinear\nfrequency variation, 3\uf0b3N .\nThe nonlinear variation of the instantaneous frequency of the component )(ts j can be written as follows [7]:\n12\n32 ...)(\n\uf02d\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf03d NNjjjjji tCtCtCFtF\nLet\u2019s assume that frequency variations )(tF ji are known a priori or from independent measurement (e.g. from\nfrequency sensors of radar and sonar systems, tachometer signal of the machinery shaft, etc) for the whole\nduration of the signal.\nIf a frequency variation is known a priori, one can use it directly. If a frequency variation is known from\nindependent measurement, one can approximate it firstly by polynomial approximation and then use the\nobtained approximation for transform adaptation.\nIn the assumed case, we propose the adaptive signal processing of transient processes by the following two-\nstep adaptation:\n\uf0b7 calculate (from the known frequency variation )(tF ji ) for each m -th segment and component )(ts j the\nmean values jimF of the instantaneous frequencies and mean values hjmC\u02c6 of the instantaneous\n5parameters hjmC , i. e. mean values of the chirp rate jmC2 , mean values of the frequency acceleration\njmC3 and mean values of the higher order parameters Njmjm CC ,...,4 ; parameters hjmC characterize the\nnonlinear variations )(tF jim of the instantaneous f1requency during m th segment\n\uf0b7 estimate the higher order chirp-Fourier transforms for the m th segment at the instantaneous frequencies\njimjim Ff \uf03d ; the chirp rate jmc2 , the frequency accelerations jmc3 and the higher order parameters of the\ntransform Njmjm cc ,...,4 used for this estimations are equal to the appropriate estimates of the signal:\nhjmhjm Cc \u02c6\uf03d .\nMean values jimF and hjmC\u02c6 could be evaluated by the following equations:\ndttF\nt\nF\nm\nm\nt\nt\njijim )(\n1 2\n1\n\uf0f2\uf044\uf03d ,\n\uf0f2 \uf02d\uf044\uf03d\n2\n1\n)(\n1\u02c6 )1(\nm\nm\nt\nt\nji\nh\nhjm dttFt\nC ,\nwhere t\uf044 is the segment duration, 1mt and 2mt are time moments of the beginning and the end of the thm \uf02d\nsegment, jihF )1( \uf02d is the )1( \uf02dh derivative of the time variation )(tF ji .\nLet\u2019s calculate for each transient block )(tx\uf06e the proposed short time HOCS only for )1( \uf02dn components\n)(ts j using this adaptive approach:\n)()()...()(\n1\n)( ...lim\n1\n... \uf053\n\uf02a\n\uf03d\n\uf0e5\uf03d imnssmsmskim\nM\nm\nmsjimmssss fXfXfXfXM\nTH\nlkjlkjlkj\n, (5)\nwhere Vimf is the instantaneous frequency of the signal component )(tsV for the mth segment; lkjV ,...,,\uf03d ,\n1,1 \uf02d\uf03d nk , \u2026, 1,1 \uf02d\uf03d nl , \uf0e5\n\uf03d\n\uf0e5 \uf03d\nl\njV\nVimimn ff ; \uf0e5imnf is the accumulated instantaneous frequency for the mth\nsegment, )( Vimms fX V and )(... \uf0e5imnssms fX lkj are the higher order chirp-Fourier transforms at the appropriate\ninstantaneous frequencies for the m th segment,\ndtetxX\nNNVmVmVm\nVm\nV\nt\nN\nc\nt\nc\nt\nc\ntfi\nmms \uf0f2\n\uf0a5\n\uf0a5\uf02d\n\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02d\n\uf03d\n)...\n32\n(2 3322\n)(\n\uf070\n, (6)\ndtetxX\nNNmmm\nmn\nlkj\nt\nN\nc\nt\nc\nt\nc\ntfi\nmssms \uf0f2\n\uf0a5\n\uf0a5\uf02d\n\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02d \uf053\uf053\uf053\uf0e5\uf03d\n)...\n32\n(2\n...\n3322\n)(\n\uf070\n, (7)\n6Vmf the initial frequency of the signal component )(tsV for the mth segment; \uf0e5\n\uf03d\n\uf053 \uf03d\nl\njV\nVmmn ff ; \uf053mnf is the\naccumulated initial frequency, \uf0e5\n\uf03d\n\uf053 \uf03d\nl\njV\nhVmhm cc .\nOne can see the differences between the general expression (1) of the short time HOCS and expression (5) of\nthe short time HOCS with the proposed adaptation at each segment. The main difference is that in expression\n(5) parameters of the HOCS are different for different segments due to adaptation.\nOne can see that in the considered case the short time HOCS is the three dimensional function (i.e. real and\nimaginary HOCS components and time). This function can be plotted using the traditional \u201cwaterfall\u201d plot. It\nfollows from expression (5) that, using the proposed approach, we cannot specify the particular frequencies at\nwhich the short time HOCS is estimated; we can only state that the short time HOCS is estimated for )1( \uf02dn\ncomponents lkj sss ,...,, .\nThe proposed short time HOCS could be also employed for the linear variations of the instantaneous\nfrequencies jiF . In this case, equations (1-4) should be used with the following conditions: .0...3 \uf03d\uf03d\uf03d Ncc\n3. Signal modeling\nTo compare the proposed and the classical transforms, an input transient random sinusoidal signal with\nconstant amplitude, random initial phase and linearly changed instantaneous frequency in time (i.e. linear\nchirp) has been passed via the following nonlinear (bilinear) system [8]:\n\uf0ef\uf0ef\uf0ee\n\uf0ef\uf0ef\uf0ed\n\uf0ec\n\uf03c\uf02b\uf03d\uf02b\uf02b\n\uf0b3\uf02b\uf03d\uf02b\uf02b\n,0],)(cos[)()(2)(\n,0],)(cos[)()(2)(\n2\n2\nxttAtxtxhtx\nxttAtxtxhtx\nC\nS\n\uf06a\uf077\uf077\n\uf06a\uf077\uf077\n\uf026\uf026\uf026\n\uf026\uf026\uf026\n(8)\nwhere\nm\ntX\ntx\n)(\n)( \uf03d , )(tX is the displacement,\nm\nk\nm\nk\nm\nc\nh CC\nS\nS \uf03d\uf03d\uf03d \uf077\uf077 ,,2\n, m and c are the system\nmass and damping coefficient respectively, Sk and Ck are the stiffness for positive displacement (i. e\nstretching) and stiffness for negative displacement (i. e. compression) respectively,\nm\nA\nA 1\uf03d , 1A is the constant\namplitude of the input signal, )(t\uf077 and \uf06a are the linearly changed circular instantaneous frequency and\nrandom initial phase uniformly distributed in the range [0; 2\uf070 ].\nThe bilinear system (8) is widely used in applications, e.g. for investigation of sub-harmonic resonances of\noffshore structures: free-hanging risers, tension leg platforms and suspended loads [8-10], articulated loading\ntowers, constrained by a connection to a massive tanker or vessels moored against fenders [11], oscillating\nparts with clearances and motion limiting stops [12], etc.\nSystem nonlinearity is detected by the proposed short time HOCS of order 3 based on the higher order chirp-\nFourier transform of order 2, (i.e. 3\uf03dn , 2\uf03dN ) because the frequency variation of the input signal is linear.\n7Parameters used for modelling of the input signal and the system are as follows: the chirp rate of the input\nsignal is 10Hz\/s; sampling frequency is 20kHz; stiffness ratios\nc\nsc\nk\nkk\nk\n\uf02d\uf03d\uf02a are 0 (linear system) and 0.1\n(nonlinear system); damping h is 250, the resonance frequencies of the system are 1500 Hz and 1460.5 Hz at\nthe stiffness ratios 0 and 0.1 respectively; linear variation of the instantaneous input signal frequency is in the\nrange (1400-1560) Hz.\nSo, the instantaneous input signal frequency goes through the resonance frequencies of both the linear and the\nnonlinear systems.\nThe output signal of the system (8) at resonance consists of the fundamental harmonic of the resonance\noscillations (at the stiffness ratio 0, linear system) and of the fundamental and higher harmonics of the\nresonance oscillations (at the stiffness ratio 0.1, nonlinear system) [10].\nGaussian white noise was added to the output signal to hinder the detection of the system nonlinearity so as to\nmore closely mimic data from the early stage of nonlinearity development; the signal\/noise ratio is 40dB.\nParameters used for estimation of the proposed short time HOCS and classical HOS of the normalized output\nacceleration )(tx\uf026\uf026 are as follows: segment size is 0. 4s (i.e. the frequency resolution is 2.5 Hz); signal duration\nis 8 s, overlapping of the internal windows is 50%, the internal window is the Hamming window, the external\nwindow is rectangular. The HOCS and HOS were estimated for an external rectangular time-domain window\nin the vicinity of system resonance.\nThe higher order transform of order 3 at the fundamental and the second resonance harmonics (i. e.\n11ss\nH ) is\nnormally used for nonlinearity detection for the system (8). In practice, the normalized higher order technique,\ni. e. skewness [4], is often employed for nonlinearity detection.\nThe normalized HOCS, skewness based on the higher order chirp-Fourier transform, could be written as\nfollows:\n\uf0e5 \uf0e5 \uf0e5\n\uf03d \uf03d \uf03d\n\uf03d\nM\nm\nM\nm\nM\nm\nsmsmsms\nss\nss\nkjkj\nkj\nkj\nXXX\nM\nTH\nTS\n1 1 1\n2221\n)(\n)(\n(9)\nA total of 800 modeling tests were performed.

The gain G , the ratio of the Fisher criteria for the proposed and the classical techniques, is\n43.1\uf03dG\nIt can be seen that the proposed new time\/multi-frequency higher order spectral transform provides a higher\nvalue of the detection effectiveness criterion, Fisher criterion, in comparison with the classical multi-frequency\ntransform and is therefore more effective for nonlinearity detection in transient cases.\n3. Conclusions\n81. It is proposed a new multidimensional time\/multi-frequency higher order spectral technique for transient\nsignals with known nonlinear and linear polynomial variations of instantaneous frequency: the short time\nhigher order chirp spectra (HOCS) based on the higher order chirp-Fourier transform and time domain\nwindowing technique.\n2. The two step adaptation is proposed for the new transform:\n\uf0b7 calculate for each segment and signal from the known instantaneous frequency variations the mean values\nof parameters which characterize these variations\n\uf0b7 estimate the HOCS for each segment using parameter values of the transform which are equal to the\nappropriate mean values of parameters which characterize known variations of instantaneous frequency\nFor adaptive usage of the proposed transform one needs to know a priori or from independent measurement the\ninstantaneous frequency variation of signal.\n3. The bilinear and linear systems under transient cosine excitation with linear variation of the instantaneous\nfrequency were simulated. System nonlinearity was detected by the short time HOCS of order 3 based on the\nhigher order chirp-Fourier transform of order 2 with the proposed adaptation. It was shown that the proposed\nHOCS is more effective for nonlinearity detection than the classical H\n"}
