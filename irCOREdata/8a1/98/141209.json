This paper demonstrates the use of AE measurements to detect,9\nmonitor and locate natural defect initiation and propagation in a thrust rolling element10\nbearing. To undertake this task a special purpose test-rig was built that allowed for11\naccelerated natural degradation of a bearing race. It is concluded that sub-surface12\ninitiation and subsequent crack propagation can be detected using a range of time and13\nfrequency domain analysis techniques on AE\u2019s generated from natural degrading14\nbearings. The paper also investigates the source characterisation of AE signals15\nassociated with a defective bearing whilst in operation.16\n17\nKeywords: Acoustic Emission, condition monitoring, source location, bearing life18\nand natural crack initiation.19\n20\n21\n1. Introduction22\nAcoustic Emission (AE) is defined as the range of phenomena that results in the23\ngeneration of structure-borne and fluid-borne (liquid, gas) propagating waves due to24\nthe rapid release of the energy from localised sources within and\/or on the surface of a25\nmaterial [1]; typical frequency content of AE is between 100 kHz to 1 MHz. A recent26\nreview details the application of AR to a varied range of rotating machinery [2]. The27\nhigh sensitivity of AE in detecting the loss of mechanical integrity at early stages has28\nbecome one of the significant advantages over the well-established vibration29\nmonitoring technique. The challenges faced with using the vibration technology to30\nmonitor the mechanical integrity of slow speed bearings (less than 60rpm) were31\nsummarised by Jamaludin et al. [3]. It was concluded that the AE technology could32\n2overcome such difficulties. Sources of AE in rotating machinery can be found in1\nimpacting, cyclic fatigue, friction, turbulence, etc [2].2\n3\nThe AE has successfully been applied to monitor bearing mechanical integrity [2, 3,4\n4, 5, 6, and 7]. Most published work was conducted on artificially or \u2018seeded\u2019 damage5\nwhich are generally induced with an electrical discharge system, engraving machine6\nor by introducing debris into the lubricant [2]. However, the applicability of AE to7\nmonitor naturally generated scuffing and pitting defects in a four-ball lubricant test8\nmachine was shown by Price et al. [8]. To date the only investigation of Yoshioka [9]9\ncan be considered the first attempt that directly addressed detection of the onset of10\nnatural degradation in bearings with AE. It must be noted that the tests undertaken by11\nYoshioka were on a bearing with only three rolling elements which is not12\nrepresentative of a typical operational bearing. Further, Yoshioka [9] terminated tests13\nonce AE activity increased beyond a defined level and as such the propagation of14\nidentified sub-surface defects to surface defects was not monitored. The investigation15\npresented in this paper builds further on the work of Yoshioka by monitoring not only16\nthe initiation of cracks, but also its propagation to spalls or surface defects on a17\nconventional bearing with the complete set of rolling elements. The location of the18\nAE source was also monitored throughout the test sequence in order to validate that19\nthe AE\u2019s generated throughout the test period can be eventually attributed to the20\nsurface defect noted at the end of the test.21\n22\n23\n2. Test-rig design and layout24\nTo encourage the natural damage condition of a test bearing, an especially test rig was25\ndesigned. A combination of a thrust ball bearing and a thrust roller bearing was26\nemployed to speed up natural crack initiation. One race of thrust ball bearing (SKF27\n51210) was replaced with a flat race taken from thrust roller bearing (SKF 81210 TN)28\nof the same size. As a consequence, this arrangement caused higher contact pressure29\non a flat track relative to the grooved track due to the reduced contact area between30\nthe ball elements and the flat race.31\n32\n33\n31\nFor this investigation, bearing run to failure tests were undertaken under natural2\ndamage conditions. A special purpose designed test-rig, as shown in figure 1, was3\nemployed for this study. It consisted of a hydraulic loading device, a geared electrical4\nmotor (MOTOVARIO-Type HA52 B3-B6-B7 j20, 46-Lubricated: AGIP), a coupling5\nand a supporting structure. The test bearing was placed between the fixed thrust6\nloading shaft and the rotating disk which housed the grooved race. The flat race was7\nfitted onto the loading shaft in a specifically designed housing. This housing was8\nconstructed to allow for placement of AE sensors and thermocouples directly onto the9\nrace. The thrust shaft was driven by a hydraulic cylinder (Hi-Force HYDRAULICS-10\nMODEL No: HP110-HAND PUMP-SINGLE SPEED-WORKING PRESSURE: 70011\nBAR) which moved forward to load the bearing and backwards for periodic12\ninspections of the test bearing face. The rotating disk was driven by a shaft attached to13\na geared motor with an output speed of 72rpm. A thrust bearing (SKF 81214 TN) was14\nplaced between the coupling and the test bearing and a flexible coupling was15\nemployed between the shaft and the geared motor.16\n17\n18\nFigure 1 Test-rig layout with test bearing19\n20\n21\n3. Instrumentation22\nA schematic of the data acquisition process is detailed in figure 2. The AE acquisition23\nsystem employed commercially available piezoelectric sensors (Physical Acoustic24\nCorporation type \u201cPICO\u201d) with an operating range of 200-750 kHz at temperatures25\n4ranging from -65 to 177oC. Four AE sensors, together with two thermocouples1\n(RoHS-Type: J x 1M 455-4371) were attached to the back of the flat raceway, see2\nfigure 1. The acoustic sensors were connected to a data acquisition system through a3\npreamplifier (40 dB gain).4\n5\n6\nFigure 2 Schematic of the data acquisition systems7\n8\n9\nThe system was set to continuously acquire AE absolute energy (atto-Joules \u2013 10-1810\nJoules) over a time constant of 10 ms at a sampling rate of 100 Hz. The absolute11\nenergy is a measure of the true energy and is derived from the integral of the squared12\nvoltage signal divided by the reference resistance (10 k-ohms) over the duration of the13\nAE signal.14\n15\nUnder normal conditions of load, rotational speed and good alignment, surface16\ndamage begins with small cracks, located between the surface of the flat track and the17\nrolling elements, which gradually propagate to the surface generating detectable AE18\nsignals. Elforjani et al. [10] employed the following theories to determine the test19\nduration to the onset of surface fatigue: Hertizan theory for determining surface20\nstresses and deformations [11], Thomas and Hoersh theory for sub-surface stress [11],21\nand, the Lundberg and Palmgren theory for fatigue evaluation [12]. For the grooved22\nrace the standard procedure for determining dynamic load rating, as described by BS23\n(British Standards Documents) 5512; 1991, was employed.24\n25\n54. Experimental results observations and discussions1\n4.1. Bearing test2\nFor this particular investigation, observations of continuous monitoring of the AE3\nlevels for 11-hours of bearing operation that reflect the general observations4\nassociated with over a dozen experimental tests are presented in figure 3. An axial5\nload of 50kN was applied on the test bearing. It was noted that relatively high levels6\nof AE activity was observed during the first two hours of operation; this was7\nattributed to run-in as after this period (2-hr) all measured AE parameters and8\ntemperature stabilised.9\n10\nSpurious increases in AE energy were noted between 3- and 7-hrs of operation. It was11\nalso observed that at approximately 10-hrs into the test AE showed significant12\nincreases in AE activity until the test was terminated (11-hrs). It is worth mentioning13\nthat the bearing was lubricated during the testing with Castrol, Moly Grease (650-EL)14\nand bearing temperature was measured by two thermocouples channels attached to the15\nback of the flat raceway. The measurement of temperature was undertaken to ensure a16\nconsistent lubricant viscosity through out the test period. The significance of this is to17\nensure that friction properties between the bearing elements were relatively constant.18\nAt the end of the test, the bearing temperature recorded a maximum value of 37 oC,19\nsee figure 3. After (11-hrs) visible surface damage was observed, as shown in figure20\n4; damage had occurred in the region 30mm from ch-3 AE sensor. The relevance of21\nthis will be presented later.22\n61\nFigure 3 Test conditions run until visually observable surface damage2\n3\nFigure 4 Crack zone on flat ring4\n4.2. Time and frequency domain analysis5\nA variety of signal-processing analysis techniques were applied to the measured AE6\ndata which included the Kolmogorov-Smirmov test (K-S test), Kurtosis (KU), Crest7\nFactor (CF), Energy Index (EI), AE-Energy (AEE) values of AE signals, enveloping8\nand FFT.9\n10\nThe KS-test was successfully applied to detect early fatigue cracks in gears and11\nbearing [13, 14, 15 and 16]. The test is a time domain signal processing technique that12\n7compares two signals to indicate the likelihood that the two signals have the same1\nprobability density function. In essence, the test involves assuming a null hypotheses2\nwhich means that the cumulative density function (CDF) of two AE signals S(t)1 and3\nS(t)2 are statistically similar. Thus, a fault condition can be indicated by comparing4\nthe KS value for an AE signal with a number of signal templates of normal operating5\nconditions. This method of analysis was applied to AE waveforms sampled at 2MHz6\nand acquired at various stages during the test programme. A measure of similarity7\nbetween AE waveforms was determined by calculating the maximum absolute8\ndistance (D) between the CDF\u2019s of AE waveforms using the equation [1].9\n10\n1 2\n- t\nD = max S(t) - S(t) f\u001f !f [1]11\n12\nAE waveform in the normal operating condition was used as reference template. This13\nensured that any variation in KS values can be attributed to the changes in bearing AE14\nsignals. For this particular test, AE waveform at 2-hrs operation was taken as15\nreference template, as this AE waveform showed the lowest transient characteristics,16\nand, it was noted that the lubricant temperature had stabilised at this period during the17\ntest. The KS-test undertaken at the 2-hr period of operation had a value of zero, see18\nfigure 5. Results showed that as early as 4-hrs into the operation of the bearing test, a19\nrelative high KS value of 0.010 was noted. It is also worth mentioning that KS values20\nbegan to increase steadily as the test passed 9-hrs of operation, reinforcing the21\nprevious observations of continuous monitoring of AE activity, as shown in figure 5.22\nOn the termination of the test (11-hrs), a maximum KS value of 0.046 was recorded,23\nsee figure 5.24\n25\nThe kurtosis (KU) is the normalised fourth statistical moment of a given signal. The26\namplitude distribution of a healthy machine is generally assumed to be Gaussian or27\n\"normal\". It is known that KU is a measure of the peakness of a signal and on the28\nbasis that a signal will contain impulsive transient events during the onset of29\ndegradation. Kurtosis values for AE waveforms sampled at 2MHz during the test30\nduration were estimated using the equation [2].31\n32\n4N\ni\ni=1\nx (amplitude) - \u021d (mean)1KU=\nN (data points) \u0131 (standard deviation)\n\u00a7 \u00b7\u00a8 \u00b8\u00a9 \u00b9\u00a6 [2]33\n81\nIt was shown that the kurtosis increased as early as 4-hrs operation; as the test passed2\nwith time, a kurtosis value of 322 was observed (after running 4-hrs). It is also worth3\nnoting that at the end of the test (11-hrs), the kurtosis reached its maximum value of4\n17180.86, see figure 5.5\n6\nThe Crest Factor (CF) is defined as the ratio of the peak value divided by the root7\nmean square (r.m.s) value of the signal. It gives an indication of impulsiveness in the8\nsignal. Crest Factor (CF) is a traditional method of measuring the smoothness of a9\nsignal and therefore a faulty bearing will generate a spiky AE signal profile. As a10\nconsequence, CF increases as bearing problems become more severe. Crest Factor11\ncalculations were also applied on the recorded AE waveforms. Equation [3] was12\nemployed to calculate the CF.13\n14\nabsolute peak value in AE waveformCF=\nrms value of AE waveform\n[3]15\n16\nWhile the test passed 4-hrs operation results indicated that CF has a relatively high17\nvalue of about 58. It is worth mentioning that as the test progressed with time CF18\nvalues showed a high sensitivity to the variation in bearing signals, see figure 5. After19\nrunning 11-hrs a maximum value CF of 263 on the termination of the test (11-hrs)20\nwas noted.21\n22\nData analysis was also undertaken using the Energy Index (EI) technique. It can be23\ndescribed as the ratio of r.m.s of a defined period of an AE signal to the r.m.s of the24\nentire AE signal. As r.m.s values are typically recorded over a predefined time25\nconstant, they are therefore not sensitive to transient changes; this formed the basis for26\nthe development of the EI [17, 18 and 19]. In this particular study EI was applied to27\nthe AE waveforms using the equation [4].28\n29\n2\nSegment\nTotal\nRMS\nEnergy Index =\nRMS\n\u00a7 \u00b7\u00a8 \u00b8\u00a9 \u00b9\n[4]30\n31\n9An increase in EI level from earlier in the test run between 2- to 5-hrs was noted; an1\nEI value of 14.0 after 4-hrs operation was observed. At approximately 7-hrs operation2\na relative rise in EI value was recorded. After running for 11-hrs the EI level reached3\na maximum value of 59.5, see figure 5.4\n5\nOne of frequently used signal characteristics is energy. The AE-Energy (Signal6\nEnergy) was also calculated for AE waveforms acquired during this test. The AE-7\nEnergy (AEE) can be defined as the integral of the squared signal (x) and calculated8\nusing the equation [5].9\nT(sec)\n2 2\n0\nAE-Energy (AEE) = x (t)dt (v .sec)\u00b3 [5]10\nA relative increase in AEE value of 0.677V2.sec was observed after 4-hrs into the test.11\nDue to the high transient nature of AE, a steady increase of AEE after 7-hrs operation12\nuntil the termination of the test was noted. The maximum value of 11.1V2.sec was13\nregistered at 11-hrs, see figure 5.14\n15\n16\n17\nFigure 5 KS-test, Kurtosis, Crest Factor, EI and AEE results associated18\nwith the case in figure 319\n20\nObservations from figure 5 indicate that the KS-test is more sensitive to periods of the21\nhigh transient nature of AE waveforms, typical for natural degrading bearings, than22\nthe other time domain techniques investigated. This conclusion was reached as the KS23\nshowed the maximum increase in levels from the start position (3-hrs into the test) to24\n10\n10-hrs of operation (point of crack initiation). This change was in the order of 33% in1\ncomparison to 3.7%, 5.1%, 3.0% and 25.9% for KU, CF, EI and AEE respectively.2\nLastly, the rate of change of all of the parameters per hour was highest for the KS test.3\n4\nLastly, running AE signals through multiple processing methods also provided more5\nways to analyze the signals and more ways to measure deviations from the normal6\nconditions. In addition to time domain analysis, enveloping of AE waveforms were7\nalso undertaken to investigate the periodicity of the transient nature of the AE\u2019s from8\nthe test bearing.9\n10\nFigures 6 to 9 highlight some AE waveforms taken at various periods during the test11\nthat where enveloped and frequency analysed. On the termination of the test (11-hrs),12\nAE waveform developed a periodicity of AE transient bursts; a strong evidence of13\n9Hz associated with defect frequency of bearing was observed, see figure 9. AE14\nwaveforms recorded at 4-, 6-, 7-, 9-, 10- and 11-hours were enveloped; results of15\nwhich are representative of that shown in figures 6 to 9.16\n17\nIt was noted at 4-hours into operation there was a broad frequency spectrum of the18\nenveloped signal, see figure 6. About 9- to 10-hrs into the test, Fourier analysis of the19\nenveloped signal started to show the periodicity of AE transient bursts, presented in20\nfigures 7 and 8. Figure 9 shows a clear periodicity of AE activity at 9Hz, as high21\nperiodic transient AE events were observed at the end of the test (11-hrs). The22\nrelevance of this will be evident later in the paper.23\n24\n11\n1\nFigure 6 AE waveform, enveloping and FFT after 4-hrs2\n3\nFigure 7 AE waveform, enveloping and FFT after 9-hrs4\n12\n1\nFigure 8 AE waveform, enveloping and FFT after 10-hrs2\n3\n4\nFigure 9 AE waveform, enveloping and FFT after 11-hrs5\n6\n13\n4.3. AE source location1\nThus far the observations and analysis indicated that AE can monitor the degradation2\nof slow speed bearing test; the next phase of analysis involved source identification of3\nAE activity throughout the test duration. One of the significant advantages of AE over4\nthe other non-destructive test (NDT) technologies is the capability of AE to determine5\nsource locations of signals emanating in real time from materials under load.6\n7\nIn application, AE signals transmitting through a medium are attenuated and arrive at8\ndifferent sensors with certain time delay. The reason for this delay can be attributed to9\nthe distance between the source (defect) and AE sensors. With knowledge of the10\nsignal velocity, the location of the AE source can be identified.11\n12\nFor this particular investigation efforts were made to identify the defect location (AE13\nsource location) in real-time. This was implemented by identifying the wave velocity14\non the ring experimentally. At a threshold of 52dB and with known distances between15\nthe AE sensors, the velocity of the AE waveform under such conditions was16\nexperimentally determined at 4,000 m\/sec. Interestingly, the dominant frequency17\ncontent of AE\u2019s recorded was approximately 300kHz and the wave velocity of 4,00018\nm\/sec corresponds to the symmetric zeroth lamb wave mode (So) for steel at19\n1.8mmMHz (0.3MHz x 6mm thk). The propagation velocity (4,000 m\/sec) was used20\nfor all source location investigations and prior to the onset of testing several Hsu-21\nNielsen sources were made at various positions on the ring surface to establish the22\naccuracy at this velocity and specific threshold level. Results were within 4% of the23\nexact geometric location of the Hsu-Nielsen sources. Figure 10 shows the source24\nlocation layout used which essentially \u2018unwrapped\u2019 the bearing race for linear25\nlocation.26\n27\nThe location plots show cumulative energy over the test simulation. It is worth28\nmentioning that only AE events above a threshold of 52dB contribute to the source29\nlocation. Whenever the threshold is exceeded, the location of the source is computed30\nand identified. The AE energy is assigned to the geometric position (source); this is a31\ncumulative process and as such a fixed source will have the largest contributory32\nenergy in a cumulative plot.33\n14\n1\n2\nFigure 10 Source location layout for linear detection3\n4\nSource location estimations used in the bearing test provided another simple and rapid5\nmeans to correlate AE events measured with a specific fault event on the test bearing.6\nThe trends in source location throughout the test period are presented in figures 11 to7\n16. At the start of the test (2-hrs operation) shown geometric concentrations of AE8\nactivity were distributed across the circumferential length of the bearing and this is9\nattributed to the run-in condition, see figure 11; AE energy value of 25 x 104 atto-10\nJoules (10-18) was recorded. It particularly interesting to note that AE events were still11\nbroadly spread across the circumference of the bearing ring; after 3- to 7-hrs12\ngeometric concentrations of AE activity in the vicinity of the eventual defect region13\nwere noted, presented in figure 12. The exact reason for this was explained by14\nElforjani et al. [10]; the occurrence of the plastically deformed pathway was attributed15\nto this sharp burst of AE activity, as visually observed at this period in the test. These16\nfigures also show that the onset of crack development could have been identified as17\nearly as 10-hrs into the operation of the test bearing, see figure 15; AE activity was18\nevident within the damaged region with a maximum AE energy value of 125 x 10619\natto-Joules (10-18). The authors believe that the crack initiated at 10-hrs of operation20\non the basis that source location results from 1\u2013 to 9-hrs operation showed a board21\nscatter of AE sources, see figures 11 to 14, but at 10-hrs of operation the22\nconcentration of AE events was from the defect region which thereafter steadily23\n15\nincreased until the test was terminated. In addition, the observations of AE activity,1\nshowed relatively strong transient activity from 10-hrs of operation, see figure 3.2\nFigure 16 shows the growing concentration of AE energy from the defect location;3\nafter 11-hrs operation the concentration of the AE source was clearly located at the4\nhighlighted region, 30mm from ch-3, and the maximum energy values of 140 x 1065\natto-Joules (10-18) was noted. This location corresponded to the actual defect visually6\nobserved at the end of the test, see figure 4.7\n8\n9\nFigure 11 Source location estimates of AE events at 1-hr operation10\n11\n16\n1\n2\nFigure 12 Source location estimates of AE events at 6-hr operation3\n4\nFigure 13 Source location estimates of AE events at 8-hr operation5\n17\n1\n2\nFigure 14 Source location estimates of AE events at 9-hr operation3\n4\n5\n6\nFigure 15 Source location estimates of AE events at 10-hr operation7\n8\n18\n1\n2\nFigure 15 Source location estimates of AE events at 11-hr operation3\n4\n4.4. Attenuation analysis5\nAttenuation analysis was also undertaken to understand the attenuation properties of6\nthe test bearing. Attenuation can be described as any reduction (or loss) in the AE7\nsignal strength (in form of amplitude or intensity) and it is expressed in decibels8\n(dB\u2019s) [20]. In acoustic emission applications, attenuation is very important property9\nbecause it determines the signal strength as a function of distance; therefore, it plays a10\nsignificant role in specifying locations of AE sensors for purposes of identifying11\nsources of AE events.12\n13\nIn this particular investigation, bearing attenuation analysis was carried out during the14\noperation. The relative attenuation of AE absolute energy measured at each channel15\nwas calculated by employing equations [6] and [7].16\n17\nT(sec)\n2\n0\nSignal Energy (E) 1Signal Power(P)= = x (t)dt\nT(sec) T(sec) \u00b3 [6]18\n19\n20\nmeasured\n10\nReference\nSignal Power (P )Relative Attenuation (dB)=10\u00d7Log\nSignal Power (P )\n\u00a7 \u00b7\u00a8 \u00b8\u00a9 \u00b9\n[7]21\n22\n19\nAnalysis revealed that the AE signals on the flat ring are attenuated with increasing1\nthe distance from the emanating AE source, as expected. For instance, AE signals,2\nrecorded at approximately 11-hrs into the test, showed greatest attenuation at ch-13\n(7.80dB) which is the maximum distant from the source, see figure 17.4\n5\n6\nFigure 17 Relative attenuation levels between 10-11 hours of operation7\n8\n5. Conclusion9\nThe study has demonstrated that AE parameters such as energy are reliable, robust10\nand sensitive to the detection of incipient cracks and surface spalls in slow speed11\nbearing. It was indicated that the presence of a crack onset and its propagation is12\ndetectable with AE technology by applying standard time and frequency analysis13\ntechniques such as KS statistic, enveloping, etc. It can be concluded that this study14\nalso successfully showed the ability to determine the source of AE during operation.15\nAt the rotational speed (72rpm) on which these tests were employed, this work is the16\nfirst known attempt at correlating AE and natural defect generation and location.17\n18\n6.
