In this\nstudy we tested the hypotheses that: (i) it is possible to engineer consistent differences\nbetween microbial communities in wastewater treatment modules; (ii) there is a positive\nrelationship between structural complexity and genetic diversity; (iii) such interactions are\nmodulated by the availability of energy. We developed four treatment modules of\nincreasingly complex support material (matrix) design, and pumped a synthetic wastewater\nthrough them for 16 weeks. We then disassembled the modules and assessed the\nphylogenetic (general eubacteria and ammonium oxidizers, by DGGE profiling) and\nphenotypic (by PLFA profiling) diversity of the communities present on the support\nmaterials. We found that different genotypic and phenotypic community structures were\nreliably generated by the engineering of their physical environment in terms of structural\ncomplexity (as determined by particle size distribution and therefore pore size distribution).\nFurthermore, there was a notably consistent response of the phenotypic structure to such\ncircumstances, and also to the presence of organic matter. However, we found no significant\nrelationships between genetic diversity and structural complexity either for eubacterial or\nammonia-oxidiser microbial groups. This work demonstrates that is it possible to engineer\nmodules of differing microbial community composition by varying their physical complexity.\nThis is an essential first step in testing relationships between system diversity and treatment\nresilience at a process level.\nKeywords\nWastewater treatment, engineered diversity, microbiological diversity, complexity, physical\nheterogeneity\n1 Introduction\nThe ideal wastewater treatment process should use renewable resources in construction and\nlittle or no energy or other inputs in operation, and provide effective treatment to meet\nstandards which protect the environment at the lowest possible economic and social cost\n(Griffin and Upton 1999). This aspiration has underpinned the widespread adoption of\nextensive or natural wastewater treatment technologies such as wetlands and ponds in recent\nyears (Brissaud, 2007; Cooper, 2009). Such extensive treatment systems are subject to, and\nshould be sufficiently robust to deal with, fluctuating environmental conditions such as\nfreezing, variable hydraulic loading, and shock loads of treatable substances and toxins\n(Salvado et al, 2001; Werker et al, 2002; Molle et al, 2006). The design and maintenance\nprotocols, for such treatment methods have been largely developed in an empirical manner,\nwith no theoretical underpinning.\nTying sound engineering to good biological-ecological theory has recently been recognised\nas a way beyond a \u201ctrial and error\u201d approach to system optimisation (Curtis et al, 2003; Todd\net al, 2003; McMahon et al, 2007). The ability to engineer biologically based wastewater\ntreatment systems to produce predictable and consistent community configurations has the\npotential to deliver more effective and efficient treatment systems, and is a long term goal of\nwastewater research (Curtis and Sloan, 2006). There is a growing view that the application of\necological theory has the potential to facilitate a transition from a descriptive to a predictive\nframework (Curtis et al, 2003; McMahon et al, 2007).\nThe design of resistant and resilient wastewater treatment systems might be possible using\nthis approach and the putative relationship between biodiversity and system stability (Elton,\n1958; McCann, 2000; Briones and Raskin, 2003; Hooper et al, 2005; Balvanera et al, 2006;\nMcMahon et al, 2007; Wittebolle et al, 2009 ) is of obvious relevance. Naeem and Li (1997)\nadvanced the idea that biodiversity represents a form of biological insurance and that\nredundancy (multiple species per functional group) enables communities to maintain function\nduring environmental change. Empirical evidence in support of the diversity-stability\nrelationship has emerged from relatively recent work in terrestrial (Griffiths et al., 2001;\nAllison and Martiny 2008; Nielsen et al 2011) and aquatic ecosystems (Naeem and Li, 1997;\nvon Canstein et al., 2002;) . Other factors, most notably abundance, may also affect the\nreliability of a functional group (Pickering, 2008).\nSinger et al. (2010) in their work on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) use by streambed\nbiofilms suggest a relationship between the fine-scale physical heterogeneity of a habitat and\ncommunity diversity. In their work, more heterogeneous flow landscapes triggered greater\nbacterial biodiversity and biofilm architecture and ultimately led to the utilisation of a\nbroader range of DOC compounds than in less physically-heterogeneous systems. It has also\nbeen demonstrated that one of the bases for the extreme levels of eukaryotic diversity found\nin soils relates to the structural heterogeneity of the pore networks and the resultant spatial\nisolation of microbes that ensues (Zhou et al. 2002). This finding suggests that it is possible\nto control the community diversity of a system by engineering its physical complexity. The\ndefinition of structural complexity is a subject of great debate (e.g. Parrott, 2010). In this\npresent study we define it as the range of niches available for colonisation. We postulate that\nthe manipulation of system complexity\/heterogeneity in toto (biological and physical\ndiversity sensu Parrott, 2010) provides a potential mechanism by which wastewater treatment\nsystem stability may ultimately be engineered. A prerequisite for testing these concepts is the\nreliable production of discrete treatment units supporting differing microbial community\ncompositions in a consistent manner. In this paper we set out to test the hypotheses: (i) that\nsystems of differing microbial community composition can be generated by altering the\nphysical complexity of a model wastewater treatment module matrix (support materials); and\n(ii) that there is a positive relationship between structural complexity and genetic diversity.\nTo achieve this goal, we designed modules of differing physical complexity. We further\nhypothesised (iii) that such interactions are modulated by the availability of energy to the\nresultant microbial communities, and hence incorporated an organic-matter treatment (added\nstraw) in the design.\n2 Materials and methods\n2.1 Experimental design\nThe experimental unit (module) was a 1.1-litre polypropylene cylindrical container packed\nwith porous media as a base for biofilm development (Fig. 1). The modules were operated as\nsubmerged aerated filters treating a simple synthetic wastewater with ammoniacal-nitrogen as\nthe principal treatment process indicator. The experiment involved four levels of matrix\ncomplexity, with an additional factor of organic matter amendment (i.e. with or without\norganic matter) imposed onto all complexity levels. The complexity levels were prescribed as\nminimal, low, medium or high , (representing an increase in the diversity of pore sizes within\nthe modules), as denoted in Table 1. The organic matter amendment comprised 1g of wheat\nstraw (1.5 mm milled). In addition 2 g of air-dried sandy soil (procured from Silsoe Farm,\nBedfordshire, UK; 52\u00b0:00\u2019:29\u2019\u2019 N: 0\u00b0:26\u2019:08\u2019\u2019W; Cottenham Series) was added to all\ntreatments as a common diverse microbial inoculum. The soil and straw were added to the\nbase of each module. In the treatments based upon mixtures, aggregates were deposited into\nlayers such that Caledonian gravel (roughly spherical, solid) was at the base, followed by\nHydroleca (roughly spherical) then Glass Aggregate (spherical solid) and finally Glasscrete\n(spherical solid), where appropriate. Such sequences were repeated three times thereby giving\nthree compounded layers. Three independent replicates of each module type were\nestablished. The synthetic wastewater solution consisted of 1.43 \u00b5M ammonium sulphate (i.e.\n45 mg N l-1) and 5.9 \u00b5M sodium bicarbonate dissolved in tap water and equilibrated at 17 \u00baC\n(\u00b11 \u00baC). The solution was supplied to the base of each module at a rate of 0.5 ml min-1 using\na peristaltic pump. Air was supplied to the base of each module at 30 litres min-1. The\nexperiment was incubated at 17\u00baC (\u00b11 \u00baC) and maintained for 16 weeks.\nEffluent was sampled weekly for ammonium-N, total oxides of nitrogen (TON), pH,\nalkalinity and conductivity using standard methods (APHA, 1998). Ammonium-N\n(automated phenate method;) and TON (automated hydrazine reduction method) were\ndetermined using the Burkard SFA 2000 auto-analyser. Alkalinity was determined by\ntitration using 0.02M HCl and Bromocresol green\/Methyl red indicator. In-module dissolved\noxygen was measured daily using a Hach HQ30d Meter, LDO101 Standard Dissolved\nOxygen Probe (Hach, Loveland, CO).\nAfter 16 weeks of operation all modules were consistently producing a nitrified effluent\n(ammonium-N <1 mg l-1) and were consequently disassembled for sampling. The filter media\nwere mixed, divided into thirds (including liquid) according to weight. Biomass was\nrecovered from the residual liquid by filtration (sterile Whatman 0.2\u00b5m filter papers), and\nreturned to the respective aliquots prior to analysis. The aliquots were analysed for microbial\nbiomass, phenotypic and genotypic structure.\n2.2 Analytical methods\n2.2.1 Biomass carbon flush\nMicrobial carbon (C) was determined by modifying the BS 7755 fumigation-extraction\ntechnique (British Standards 1997). The matrix and associated filters were fumigated under\nchloroform for 24h at 20\u00b0C. Following fumigation, living biomass C was extracted by\nshaking for 1h with 0.5M potassium sulphate. Associated un-fumigated samples were also\nextracted to determine non-microbial carbon. Extracted C was determined using a Segmented\nFlow Analyser based upon UV digestion (Burkard Scientific SFA-2000 Segmented Flow\nAnalyser: Burkhard, Herts, UK). We did not apply a correction factor to estimate microbial\nbiomass since published factors relate to soil matrices.\n2.2.2 DNA analysis\nDNA was extracted from the matrices using the FastDNA SPIN Kit for soil (Qbiogene,\nCambridge, UK), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n2.2.3 Polymerase chain reaction\nThe target gene fragments were amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using\n16-S based ribosomal RNA eubacterial- or ammonia-oxidising bacterial (AOB) specific\nprimers. For eubacteria, the primers comprised (from 5\u2019end to 3\u2019 end):\nCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG; ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG; Muyzer et al., 1993), and for\nAOB primer sequences were GGAGRAAAGYAGGGGATCG;\nCTAGCYTTGTAGTTTCAAACGC; Kowalchuk et al., 1997). Forward primers contained\nthe GC- clamp \u2013 CGCCCGCCGCGCGCGGCGGGCGGGGCGGGGGCACGGGGGG. Each\nsample for PCR amplification contained 1 \uf06dl of template DNA; 1 \uf06dl of forward and reverse\nprimer (10 p-moles per \uf06dl); and 47 \uf06dl of MegaMix-Blue (Microzone, West Sussex, UK). For\neubacteria PCR conditions were 3 min, 95oC initial denaturation followed by 30 s, 95\u00b0C; 1\nmin, 65\u00b0Cb; 1 min, 72\u00b0C (24 cycles); 30 s, 95\u00b0C; 1 min, 53\u00b0C; 1 min, 72\u00b0C (15 cycles); and\nfinal extension 10 min, 72\u00b0C. For AOB, PCR conditions were 3 min, 95\u00b0C initial\ndenaturation followed by 30 s, 95\u00b0C; 1 min, 57\u00b0C; 1 min, 72\u00b0C (30 cycles); final extension\n10 min, 72\u00b0C. PCR amplification reactions were performed using a Perkin Elmer DNA\nThermal Cycler (Bucks, England).\n2.2.4 Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)\nThis technique was conducted as described by Muyzer et al. (1993), with the exception that\neither a 10% (w\/v) or a 7% (w\/v) polyacrylamide gel were used with a range of denaturants at\n30-60% (w\/v). PCR-amplified samples were directly applied onto a 10% (w\/v) or a 7% (w\/v)\npolyacrylamide gel in 0.5\u00d7TE (20 mM Tris acetate at pH 7.4, 10 mM sodium acetate, 0.5\nmM Na2-EDTA). The gradient in the gel was formed with 10% (w\/v) or a 7% (w\/v)\nacrylamide stock solution (acrylamide-N,N\u2019-methylenebisacrylamide, 37:1), which contained\n30% and 60% denaturant (7 M urea) and 40% (v\/v) formamide deionised with AG501-X8\nmixed-bed resin, using a D-Gene system (Biorad, Hemel Hempstead, UK) . Gels were run for\n4 h at 200V constant voltage and at 60\u00b0C and subsequently stained for 30 minutes in SYBR\ngreen I (Sigma, Poole, UK). The presence, relative location and intensity of the resultant\nbands were analysed using Bionumerics 4.0 (Applied Maths BVBA, Saint-Martens-Latem,\nBelgium).\n2.2.5 Phenotypic community structure\nPhospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis was used to assess the phenotypic structure of the\nmicrobial communities using the method of Frosteg\u00e5rd et al. (1993). Phospholipids were\nextracted from aliquots representing one-third of the resultant matrices using chloroform,\nmethanol and citrate buffer to the ratio of 1:2:0.8 (v\/v\/v), fractionated by solid phase\nextraction, depolymerised and then derivatised by mild alkaline methanolysis. The resultant\nfatty acid methyl esters were analysed by gas chromatography (Agilent Technologies, Santa\nClara, California, USA).\n2.3 Statistical analyses\nThe dimensionality of the multivariate DGGE and PLFA profiles was reduced using\nunconstrained principal component (PC) analysis using the correlation matrix. The Shannon-\nWiener Index was calculated for DGGE profiles (Magurran, 1988). PCs, diversity indices and\nC-flush data were analysed by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Post-hoc Fisher\nmultiple range test was applied to determine heterogeneous groups of means, using Statistica\nv 9.1.\n3 Results and discussion.\n3.1 Biomass carbon flush\nCarbon flush is a measure of the total amount of biomass in the system. Structural complexity\nand straw did influence C-flush following chloroform fumigation but no significant\ninteraction (Table 2) was observed. There was a greater C-flush from Minimal-complexity\nmodules than in the other three types, regardless of the presence of straw (Fig. 2). This is\ncounter-intuitive as it might be expected greater opportunity existed for biomass development\nin relation to surface area, which increased with module complexity. The addition of straw\nresulted in a greater C-flush (1.54 versus 2.61 \u00b5g C g-1 matrix for no-straw and plus-straw\ntreatments respectively, pooled SE 0.18), demonstrating that the additional C added in the\nform of straw resulted in a greater microbial biomass, as would be expected.\n3.2 DGGE profiles\nThere were no significant interactions between structural complexity and straw addition upon\neubacterial profiles for any of the first three PCs, which collectively accounted for 40% of the\nvariance (Table 2). PC1-3 all discriminated significantly between the different forms of\nstructural complexity (Table 2) with PC1 separating Low- from High- complexity modules,\nand PC2 Minimal-complexity modules from the others (Fig. 3A). PC3 also significantly\nseparated Low-complexity modules from the other three, which were otherwise similar (data\nnot shown). Therefore the differences in the eubacterial community would appear to be\ncontrolled by complexity of the modules.\nThe Shannon diversity index for eubacterial profiles was significantly greater in the presence\nof straw (2.27 versus 2.51 for no-straw and plus-straw treatments respectively; pooled SE\n0.063, P<0.05). Whilst statistically significant, such a difference is comparatively small in the\ncontext of this index. This suggests that there were more species when additional substrate\nwas provided, which we would expect. There was no effect of structural complexity upon the\nShannon index (Table 2). This then does not support the hypothesis that greater structural\ndiversity necessarily results in greater phylogenetic diversity, but does confirm that\ncommunity phenotypic composition is sensitive to such properties, at least in terms of the\neubacterial community.\nIn relation to ammonia-oxidiser community profiles, there was a significant interaction\nbetween structural complexity and straw addition for PC1 and a direct straw effect for PC2\n(Table 2). In the absence of straw, there were essentially two classes of genetic profile, viz.\nthose associated with Minimal- and Low-complexity, and those with Medium- and High-\ncomplexity modules (Fig. 3B). Therefore the complexity of the modules has produced\ndistinctly different AOB communities in the absence of straw amendment. However, when\nstraw was present, profiles associated with the Medium-complexity modules were distinct\nfrom the other three module types (Fig. 3B). Given that the effect was manifest only in the\nMedium-complexity modules, its basis is unclear.\nThe Shannon diversity index for AOB profiles was smaller in High-complexity modules than\nthe other three types, which were otherwise similar (1.01 for High versus 1.33, 1.35, 1.44 for\nMedium, Low and Minimal modules respectively, pooled SE 0.09). Again, this does not\napparently support the hypothesis of a positive relationship between genetic diversity per se\nand structural complexity. There was no significant effect of straw addition upon the AOB\ndiversity index (Table 2), which would be expected, as these organisms are primarily\nautotrophs and not therefore reliant upon an energy source from the added organic matter.\n3.3 Phenotypic profiles\nThere were no significant interactions between structural complexity and straw addition upon\nthe phenotypic profiles for any of the first three PCs, which collectively accounted for 60% of\nthe variance. There was a highly significant effect of the presence of straw upon the PLFA\nprofiles, which dominated PC1 (Table 2). There was however, clear separation of module\ntypes with respect to phenotype in PCs 2 and 3 (Fig. 4). There was a strikingly consistent\ntrajectory in PC2 with respect to structural complexity, with the Minimal- and High-\ncomplexity modules being at the two extremes and the other modules intermediate (Fig 4A).\nThe High-complexity modules were then distinct in relation to PC3 (Fig 4B). The addition of\norganic matter therefore had a dominant effect upon the phenotypic structure in all cases,\nwhich indicates that the microbial phenotype was strongly influenced by the presence of\nadditional substrate. There was then a consistent effect of structural complexity upon the\nphenotype, revealed by the apparent trajectory in PC2 and distinctness of the High-\ncomplexity treatment in PC3. The microbial phenotypic structure was therefore consistently\nresponsive to both the presence of organic matter in the microcosm and its structural context.\nWe suggest this is because the phenotype is essentially a manifestation of the\ngenotype:environment interaction, and therefore has a high fidelity to the environmental\ncontext in which it develops.\n3.4 General discussion\nThe effect of structural complexity upon the bacterial phylogenetic diversity is not apparently\nin accord with previous data in relation to structure:complexity relationships, despite there\nbeing significant effects upon other properties. One of the mechanisms by which such\ndiversity arises is the spatial isolation of microbes in small-scale physical niches (Zhou et al\n2002), which can be attenuated by connection via water films (Zhou et al 2002; Long and Or\n2009). Since the modules in this study were saturated, such isolation mechanisms are unlikely\nto have operated. Furthermore, in microbial communities a large proportion of the\ncommunity is commonly to be found in resting\/quiescent structures (Llorrens et al, 2010).\nThis is not analogous to the composition of communities of plants and animals in most\necosystem studies. Although plants do have substantial dormant phases (seeds), these are\nrarely measured in studies of function-diversity relationships \u2013 usually such work focuses on\nadults, and over relatively short time scales (e.g. Cardinale, et al, 2006). Therefore, we\nsuggest that direct comparisons may only be drawn between microbial community\nphenotypes and those ecological studies where complexity:diversity relationships have been\nderived. We cannot of course account for those taxa that fall below the detection threshold of\nthe methods employed. However, since those taxa will account for less than 1% of the\nbiomass (Muzer et al., 1993) they will not have a significant effect on the ammonia or carbon\nremoval in an engineered system.\n4 Conclusions\nThis study strongly supports our first hypothesis that differing microbial community\ncompositions, both in relation to the phylotype and phenotype can reliably be generated by\nengineering their physical environment in terms of structural complexity. Furthermore, there\nwas apparently a notably consistent response of the phenotypic structure to such\ncircumstances. The second hypothesis of a positive relationship between phylogenetic\ndiversity and structural complexity was not supported either for general (eubacterial) or\nspecific (AOB) microbial groups. This work demonstrates that we can engineer modules of\ndiffering microbial community composition by varying their physical complexity. This is an\nessential first step in testing relationships between system diversity and treatment resilience at\na process level.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge funding support from the Engineering and Physical\nSciences Research Council, Project Number EP\/G005788\/1, and to two anonymous reviewers\nfor their helpful comments on an earlier draft.\nRole of the funding source: The EPSRC played no role in study design; in the collection,\nanalysis, and interpretation of data; in the writing of the report; and in the decision to submit\nthe paper for publication.\nReferences\nAllison, S.D., Martiny, J.B.H., 2008.
