Introduction\n[2] The Tibetan Plateau is the most extensive region of\nhigh topography on the face of the Earth and is thus a\ncritical location for answering fundamental questions about\nthe behavior of the lithosphere and the processes that act\nupon its surface. In particular, the eastern margin of the\nplateau is a crucial location for testing and understanding\nthe applicability of a number of tectonic models that aim to\nexplain the development of the Tibetan orogen [e.g.,Molnar\nand Tapponnier, 1975; Tapponnier et al., 1982; England\nand Houseman, 1986; Royden et al., 1997; England and\nMolnar, 1990] since these models make predictions about\nthe behavior of the lower and upper crust, and by implica-\ntion, surface processes in this area.\n[3] A number of previous studies have focused on obtain-\ning data from the topographically elevated regions along the\neastern border of the Tibetan Plateau (Figure 1), with a view\nto deriving the uplift and denudation history of this geo-\nlogically enigmatic region [Kirby et al., 2000, 2002, 2003;\nClark et al., 2005; Schoenbohm et al., 2004]. The most\nstriking geological conundrum in the area concerns how a\nmajor topographic front was created and maintained along\nthe eastern plateau margin with only minor thrust faulting\nduring the Cenozoic [Burchfiel et al., 1995; Wilson et al.,\n2006]. This is problematic in the framework of traditional\ntectonic models, especially considering that GPS studies\ndemonstrate that currently only limited convergence (4 \u00b1\n2 mm per year) is taking place across the Longmen Shan\n[Chen et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2004]. These first-order\nobservations have led to inferences of lower crustal flow\nbeing the dominant tectonic mechanism in the area [Royden\net al., 1997; Clark and Royden, 2000]. This and other\nmodels have been assessed to some extent through studies\nof active faulting (including fault type, rates and magni-\ntudes) [Burchfiel et al., 1995; Kirby et al., 2000, 2003;\nDensmore et al., 2007] and thermochronology [Arne et al.,\n1997; Kirby et al., 2002].\n[4] Thermochronological studies suggest that this moun-\ntainous region, which lies to the west of the Sichuan Basin,\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 113, B04409, doi:10.1029\/2006JB004739, 2008\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Department of Earth Sciences, Institute of Geology, ETH Zu\u00a8rich,\nZu\u00a8rich, Switzerland.\n2Now at Shell UK Limited, Aberdeen, UK.\n3Now at Department of Geography, Durham University, Durham, UK.\n4School of Earth Sciences, University of Melbourne, Melbourne,\nVictoria, Australia.\n5Now at AGD Operations, Heathcote, Victoria, Australia.\n6Now at Geologisch-Pala\u00a8ontologisches Institut, Heidelberg, Germany.\n7Center for Earthquake Research and Information, University of\nMemphis, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.\n8National Key Laboratory of Oil and Gas Reservoir Geology and\nExploitation, Chengdu University of Technology, Sichuan, China.\nCopyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/08\/2006JB004739$09.00\nB04409 1 of 23\nF\nig\nu\nre\n1\n.\nG\neo\nlo\ng\nic\nal\nan\nd\nte\nct\no\nn\nic\nm\nap\no\nf\nS\nic\nh\nu\nan\nB\nas\nin\nan\nd\nsu\nrr\no\nu\nn\nd\nin\ng\nre\ng\nio\nn\ns,\nco\nm\np\nil\ned\nfr\no\nm\nM\na\net\na\nl.\n[2\n0\n0\n2\n].\nN\no\nte\nth\nat\nth\ne\no\nu\ntc\nro\np\np\nin\ng\nst\nra\nta\nw\nit\nh\nin\nth\ne\nS\nic\nh\nu\nan\nB\nas\nin\nar\ne\nd\no\nm\nin\nan\ntl\ny\no\nf\nM\nes\no\nzo\nic\nag\ne\nw\nit\nh\nth\ne\nex\nce\np\nti\no\nn\no\nf\nli\nm\nit\ned\nE\no\nce\nn\ne\nan\nd\nQ\nu\nat\ner\nn\nar\ny\nd\nep\no\nsi\nts\nw\nit\nh\nin\nth\ne\nw\nes\nte\nrn\nm\no\nst\nb\nas\nin\n.\nT\nh\ne\ng\nen\ner\nal\no\nu\ntc\nro\np\np\nat\nte\nrn\nw\nit\nh\nin\nth\ne\nb\nas\nin\nre\nfl\nec\nts\nth\ne\nex\np\no\nsu\nre\no\nf\np\nro\ng\nre\nss\niv\nel\ny\nlo\nw\ner\nst\nra\nti\ng\nra\np\nh\nic\nle\nv\nel\ns\ncl\no\nse\nr\nto\nw\nh\ner\ne\nth\ne\nY\nan\ng\ntz\ne\nR\niv\ner\nex\nit\ns\nth\ne\nS\nic\nh\nu\nan\nB\nas\nin\nn\nea\nr\nth\ne\nT\nh\nre\ne\nG\no\nrg\nes\nR\neg\nio\nn\n.\nT\nh\ne\nd\nas\nh\ned\nb\no\nx\nin\nd\nic\nat\nes\nth\ne\nlo\nca\nti\no\nn\no\nf\nth\ne\nX\nio\nn\ng\np\no\nan\nti\ncl\nin\ne\nsh\no\nw\nn\nin\nF\nig\nu\nre\n7\n.\nB04409 RICHARDSON ET AL.: SICHUAN BASIN DENUDATION\n2 of 23\nB04409\nmay have been elevated since at least the Miocene [Kirby et\nal., 2002] and since this time, rivers have incised into the\nplateau area and removed large volumes of sedimentary\nmaterial [Kirby et al., 2003]. The signal of such major rock\nuplift and\/or denudation should be contained within the\nCenozoic sediments of the Sichuan Basin, but since post-\nMesozoic strata are missing from much of the basin [Chen\net al., 1995; Burchfiel et al., 1995], we have to turn to the\noffshore sedimentary record to detect this signal, or deter-\nmine the thermal history of erosion and deposition within\nthe basin using low-temperature thermochronology on the\nremaining pre-Cenozoic strata.\n[5] In this study, we address this latter point through the\napplication of apatite fission track (AFT) and (U-Th)\/He\nthermochronology in order to place constraints on the\nmagnitude and distribution of missing section within the\nSichuan Basin, as well as the timing of Cenozoic erosion.\nWe find that the basin experienced widespread erosion of\n1\u20134 km that began sometime after 40 Ma. These results\nprovide first-order constraints on both the topographic\ndevelopment of the eastern Tibetan Plateau and on Ceno-\nzoic drainage reorganization in Southeast Asia, in particular\nthe growth and development of the Yangtze River [Clark et\nal., 2004; Clift et al., 2006].\n2. Regional Setting\n2.1. Structure and Tectonic Evolution\n[6] The present-day Sichuan Basin is a topographically\nwell-defined rhomboid-shaped basin, bounded on all sides\nby mountains and drained by the Yangtze River and a\nnumber of major tributaries (Figure 2). The basement\nunderlying the Sichuan Basin is a component part of the\nYangtze Block, which was formed through the Archean and\npartially reworked in the Proterozoic [Wang et al., 1989;\nZheng et al., 2006]. It appears to be structurally distinct\nfrom the other parts of the Yangtze Block, based on\ngeophysical evidence, including higher seismic attenuation\nat depth which corresponds in area with the current topo-\ngraphic low [Liang et al., 2004; Hearn et al., 2004, 2005;\nWang et al., 2005; S. Wang et al., S-wave amplitude\ntomography of China, submitted to Journal of Geophysical\nResearch, 2008], strong positive magnetic anomalies under\nthe central basin [Hsu\u00a8, 1989], and magmatic rocks encoun-\ntered in deep boreholes [Wang et al., 1989].\n[7] The Sichuan Basin has experienced relatively little\ninternal deformation, yet it is surrounded by four distinct\norogenic belts (Figure 1). To the west lies the Longmen\nShan fold and thrust belt, initially formed by the closure of\nthe Songpan-Ganzi ocean basin during the Late Triassic; to\nthe north lies the East Qinling and Daba Shan, a conse-\nquence of Triassic collision between the North and South\nChina Blocks; to the south, the Xichang-Yunnan fold and\nthrust belt, an active region of strike-slip faulting; and to the\neast lies the Hunan-Guangxi fold belt, a region of intra-\ncontinental compression of uncertain Triassic to Cretaceous\nage. Isopach maps of the Mesozoic strata within the Sichuan\nBasin (Figure 3) demonstrate that tectonic activity at the\nmargins of the basin shifted its location through time. High\ntopography was initially established in the Longmen Shan\nduring the latter part of the Triassic when the Longmen\nShan Foreland Basin developed [Chen and Wilson, 1996; Li\net al., 2003] (Figure 3a). The locus of deposition then\nshifted to the northeastern margin of the basin in the Middle\nJurassic, probably due to thrusting within the Daba Shan\n(Figure 1) during continued convergence between the North\nand South China Blocks (Figure 3b). By Late Jurassic, the\nmain depocenter became \"cornered\" into the region between\nthe Longmen Shan and Daba Shan margins [Meng et al.,\n2005] (Figure 3c). The less well studied eastern and\nsouthern margins of the Sichuan Basin were probably\nestablished as topographically elevated areas relative to\nthe basin by the end of the Cretaceous [Yan et al., 2003],\nand field evidence suggests that the Sichuan Basin most\nprobably had become an internally drained, or at least\nsedimentologically closed, basin by this time. The evidence\nfor the development of each of these margins is considered\nbelow.\n2.1.1. Western Margin: Longmen Shan\n[8] The Longmen Shan fold and thrust belt forms the\nwestern and most topographically impressive margin of the\nSichuan Basin. This zone was an area of significant crustal\nshortening during the Late Norian-Rhaetian Indosinian\norogeny [Harrowfield and Wilson, 2005], and the resultant\nloading of the adjacent region of the Yangtze craton led to\nits flexural subsidence and the deposition of up to 4 km of\nclastic sediment in the Longmen Shan Foreland Basin [Li et\nal., 2003]. This Late Triassic foreland basin is a direct\nconsequence of the closure of the Songpan-Ganzi ocean\nbasin that lay to the west of the Longmen Shan [Chen and\nWilson, 1996; Dirks et al., 1994; Burchfiel et al., 1995; Li et\nal., 2003; Weislogel et al., 2006].\n[9] Although the climax of accommodation generation\nwithin the Longmen Shan Foreland Basin occurred with\ndeposition of the Upper Triassic Xujiahe Group, there is\nevidence for later fold and thrust activity in the Longmen\nShan through the Jurassic and into the Early Cretaceous\n[Burchfiel et al., 1995; Arne et al., 1997]. These persistent\nmountain building episodes are reflected not only in a shift\nof the main sedimentary depocenter to the northeastern\ncorner of the basin [Meng et al., 2005] (Figure 3c), but\nalso in continued metamorphism and crustal deformation\nwithin the Longmen Shan and Songpan-Garze regions\n[Wallis et al., 2003]. The Longmen Shan margin continues\nto be tectonically active to the present day, with a number of\nprimarily dextral strike-slip faults [Chen et al., 1994; Kirby\net al., 2000; Densmore et al., 2007].\n[10] As a result of these cyclic episodes of tectonic\nactivity, the Longmen Shan has probably been a region of\nelevated topography relative to the Sichuan Basin since at\nleast the Late Triassic, as it has been a major source of\nsediment to the Sichuan Basin since this time. The fact that\nUpper Triassic marginal foreland basin deposits have yet to\nbe consumed by the eastward propagation of the thrust front\ninto the margin of the basin indicates that the western\nboundary of the basin has moved minimally since this time\n[Li et al., 2003].\n2.1.2. Northern Margin: East Qinling and Daba Shan\n[11] Collision of the North China Block (NCB) and South\nChina Block (SCB) during the Triassic led to the formation\nof the Qinling-Dabie Orogen [e.g., Meng and Zhang, 1999].\nThe collision initiated at the easternmost end of the orogen,\nand progressed from east to west, diachronously closing the\nintervening ocean [Zhao and Coe, 1987; Zhang, 1997;\nB04409 RICHARDSON ET AL.: SICHUAN BASIN DENUDATION\n3 of 23\nB04409\nF\nig\nu\nre\n2\n.\nT\no\np\no\ng\nra\np\nh\ny\no\nf\nth\ne\nS\nic\nh\nu\nan\nB\nas\nin\nre\ng\nio\nn\nd\ner\niv\ned\nfr\no\nm\nS\nR\nT\nM\nd\nig\nit\nal\nel\nev\nat\nio\nn\nm\no\nd\nel\nw\nit\nh\n3\n-a\nrc\nse\nco\nn\nd\n(\u0001\n9\n0\nm\n)\nre\nso\nlu\nti\no\nn\n.\nM\naj\no\nr\nri\nv\ner\ns\nar\ne\nsh\no\nw\nn\nas\nb\nla\nck\nli\nn\nes\n.\nB04409 RICHARDSON ET AL.: SICHUAN BASIN DENUDATION\n4 of 23\nB04409\nF\nig\nu\nre\n3\n.\nIs\no\np\nac\nh\nm\nap\ns\nfo\nr\np\nre\nse\nn\nt-\nd\nay\nth\nic\nk\nn\nes\nse\ns\no\nf\nM\nes\no\nzo\nic\nst\nra\nta\nw\nit\nh\nin\nth\ne\nS\nic\nh\nu\nan\nB\nas\nin\n;\nd\nat\na\nd\ner\niv\ned\nfr\no\nm\nP\net\nro\nle\nu\nm\nG\neo\nlo\ng\ny\no\nf\nC\nh\nin\na\n[1\n9\n8\n7\n].\nS\nh\no\nw\nn\nar\ne\n(a\n)\nU\np\np\ner\nT\nri\nas\nsi\nc\n(X\nu\nji\nah\ne\nF\no\nrm\nat\nio\nn\ns\n2\n,\n3\n,\nan\nd\n4\n);\n(b\n)\nM\nid\nd\nle\nJu\nra\nss\nic\n(S\nh\nax\nim\nia\no\nF\no\nrm\nat\nio\nn\n);\n(c\n)\nM\nid\nd\nle\n-U\np\np\ner\nJu\nra\nss\nic\n(S\nu\nin\nin\ng\nan\nd\nP\nen\ng\nla\niz\nh\nen\nF\no\nrm\nat\nio\nn\ns)\n;\n(d\n)\nC\nre\nta\nce\no\nu\ns\nan\nd\nP\nal\neo\ng\nen\ne.\nN\no\nte\nth\nat\nC\nre\nta\nce\no\nu\ns\nst\nra\nta\nar\ne\nm\nis\nsi\nn\ng\no\nv\ner\nm\nu\nch\no\nf\nth\ne\nS\nic\nh\nu\nan\nB\nas\nin\nan\nd\nar\ne\no\nn\nly\no\nb\nse\nrv\ned\nar\no\nu\nn\nd\nth\ne\nn\no\nrt\nh\nw\nes\nte\nrn\nan\nd\nso\nu\nth\nw\nes\nte\nrn\nm\nar\ng\nin\ns\no\nf\nth\ne\nb\nas\nin\n.\nH\nea\nv\ny\nb\nla\nck\nli\nn\ne\nsh\no\nw\ns\np\nre\nse\nn\nt\nto\np\no\ng\nra\np\nh\nic\nb\nas\nin\nb\no\nu\nn\nd\nar\ny.\nB04409 RICHARDSON ET AL.: SICHUAN BASIN DENUDATION\n5 of 23\nB04409\nFigure 4.

Final\nclosure of the Qinling Suture probably took place during the\nMiddle to Late Jurassic [Huang and Opdyke, 1991; Gilder\nand Courtillot, 1997], but continued postcollision conver-\ngence developed the East Qinling thrust system [Mattauer et\nal., 1985; Wang et al., 2003] (Figure 1).\n[12] In the western Qinling orogenic belt, exhumation\nwas initiated in the Middle Triassic and continued into the\nEarly Cretaceous, resulting in profound northeast-southwest\ndirected shortening within the Daba Shan [Wang et al.,\n2003]. Indentors within the SCB located in the Shennongjia\nand Hannan areas resulted in more intensive deformation in\nthese two zones and the formation of Archean-Proterozoic\ncored domes with a typical E-W trend [Cai and Liu, 1996;\nWang et al., 2003]. Through the Cretaceous and early\nTertiary, the Qinling Shan almost certainly underwent con-\ntinuous slow cooling and denudation, as supported by recent\napatite fission-track analyses and modeling [Enkelmann et\nal., 2006].\n2.1.3. Southern Margin: Xicang-Yunnan Fold and\nThrust Belt\n[13] To the south of the Sichuan Basin lies a northwest-\nsoutheast trending fold and thrust belt, which became a\nregion of significant Late Cenozoic transcurrent faulting\nalong the sinistral Xianshuihe-Xiaojiang and Red River\/\nDali Fault systems as a result of the India-Asia collision\n[Wang et al., 1998].\n[14] The Sichuan Basin was probably connected to the\nCentral Yunnan Basin via the Xichang Basin (Figure 1)\nduring the Triassic and Jurassic [Yang et al., 1986; Co-\nOperative Geological Group of Japan and China in the\nPanxi Region, 1986; Zhang et al., 1990; Huang and\nOpdyke, 1991]. Evidence for this notion comes from the\nfact that the Jurassic of the Xichang Basin area is dominated\nby fluvial and lacustrine facies which are lateral equivalents\nof those in the Sichuan Basin, suggesting that both basins\n(Figures 1 and 3c) were therefore linked at this time [Zhang\net al., 1990]. By the end of the Cretaceous, the depositional\nenvironment within the Xichang Basin became fully re-\nstricted lacustrine, with deposition of evaporitic gypsum,\nindicating that a connection to the Sichuan Basin no longer\nexisted [Zhang et al., 1990] (Figures 3d and 4). Closure\nmost probably occurred due to compression of the region,\nstarting at least as early as the Late Jurassic to Middle-Late\nCretaceous Yanshan tectonic movement, which resulted in\nUpper Cretaceous rocks of the Xiaoba Formation being\ndeposited unconformably on top of Middle-Upper Jurassic\nand Lower Cretaceous strata [Zhang et al., 1990]. It seems\nlikely therefore that higher topography was being developed\nin this area at least as early as the Middle to Late Creta-\nceous. Low-temperature thermochronological studies indi-\ncate that rapid cooling in the Xianshuihe-Xiaojian region\nwas initiated at approximately 13 Ma [Clark et al., 2005].\n2.1.4. Eastern Margin: Hunan-Guangxi Fold Belt\n[15] The eastern margin of the Sichuan Basin is formed\nby a northeast-trending fold and thrust belt with a number of\nassociated open to closed, upright, cylindrical folds that\nhave propagated into the easternmost basin [Wang et al.,\n1989; Hsu\u00a8 et al., 1990]. Determining the precise timing of\nthe folds in this region is difficult, due to the lack of young\nsediments, although it is generally assumed that folding and\nthrusting took place throughout the Mesozoic until at least\nthe Middle Cretaceous (Qianjiang deformation) [Wang et\nal., 1989] or even Late Cretaceous [Yan et al., 2003]. A\nnumber of authors have proposed the existence of an\nearlier Late Triassic foreland basin on this margin of the\nSichuan Basin [Hsu\u00a8, 1989; Kimura et al., 1990; Wan and\nZhu, 1991; Korsch et al., 1997], although this remains\npoorly substantiated.\n2.2. Stratigraphy\n[16] The Sichuan Basin was an area of marine sedimen-\ntary deposition almost throughout the Palaeozoic. The\nprimarily carbonate platform conditions of the Permian of\nthe Yangtze Block continued into the Early and Middle\nTriassic, with a platform-dominated open marine succession\nin eastern Sichuan, and shallow marine to tidal depositional\nenvironments near the western, northern, and southern\nboundaries of the basin. The Basin became the site of\nnonmarine sediment accumulation toward the end of the\nTriassic (Figure 4) [Burchfiel et al., 1995; Regional Geology\nof Sichuan Province, 1991; Liu et al., 1982; Petroleum\nGeology of China, 1987]. A transition from shallow-marine\nto nonmarine conditions occurred during deposition of the\nXujiahe Formation. Sandstone, shale, interbedded coal, and\nconglomerate (most common in the northern Sichuan Basin)\nwere deposited within the foreland basin with a maximum\nthickness of over 3000 m adjacent to the Longmen Shan [Li\net al., 2003].\n[17] Throughout the Jurassic and Cretaceous, large thick-\nnesses of continental red beds accumulated within the basin\n(Figure 4). During the Jurassic, deformation continued to the\nnorth and west of the Sichuan Basin, documented by both\nthe stratigraphic architecture within the basin (Figure 3) and\nby the presence of conglomeratic alluvial fan deposits along\nthese margins, most notably during the Middle Jurassic.\nJurassic strata crop out over much of the Sichuan Basin\n(Figure 1) and are also significant within the fold and thrust\nbelts to the east and south. These strata are dominated by\ncontinental red beds deposited in alluvial, fluvial, and\nlacustrine environments, with a total residual Jurassic sed-\nimentary thickness of 1 to 3 km.\n[18] Cretaceous rocks are only exposed near the western,\nsouthern, and northern boundaries of the Sichuan Basin\n(Figures 1 and 3d). Alluvial fan deposits are present along\nthe westernmost margin of the basin, with discernable fan\ngeometries, and clasts derived mainly from Palaeozoic\ncarbonates exposed within the eastern Longmen Shan. More\ndistal deposits, such as those around Chengdu, are typically\nlacustrine with minor interbedded evaporitic deposits. Cre-\ntaceous rocks towards the south of the basin are more\ntypically red aeolian sandstones within the Jiaguan Forma-\ntion (Figure 4), overlain by evaporate-bearing mudstones\nand siltstones of the Guankou Formation [Liu and Zeng,\n1988]. In the southeastern corner of the basin (Chongqing\nProvince), fluvial sandstones are typical, often with inter-\nbedded mudstones.\n[19] Strata typically mapped as Eocene on Chinese geo-\nlogical maps are exposed only in the southwesternmost\ncorner of the Sichuan Basin. These strata are poorly dated,\ndue to their continental red bed facies nature. Lithologies\nare mainly fine-grained red siltstones and mudstones with\nB04409 RICHARDSON ET AL.: SICHUAN BASIN DENUDATION\n7 of 23\nB04409\nthicknesses typically up to a few hundred meters. To the\nwest of Ya\u2019an city, however, there is a thick succession of\nfluvial and alluvial conglomerate, spectacularly exposed in\na gorge to the northwest of Ya\u2019an (295128 E, 3340686 N,\nUTM zone 48N) which may be up to 1 km in total\nthickness. Although they only crop out in fairly limited\nareas, their thickness and lateral facies variations imply that\nthese strata may have been deposited over a much wider\nregion [Burchfiel et al., 1995].\n[20] Upper Cenozoic strata are present only within the\nChengdu subbasin, confined on their eastern side by the\nLongquan Shan anticline (Figure 1). Although sequences\ntraditionally mapped as Neogene are thin, they are probably\nmore widespread than previously recognized, since in the\npast only the well-cemented Dayi and Ya\u2019an conglomerates\nwere mapped as Neogene. The total combined stratigraphic\nthickness for the Neogene\/Quaternary is locally as much as\n500 m.\n[21] Away from the limited Cenozoic exposures along its\nwestern margin, the Sichuan Basin is floored largely by\nMesozoic rocks and is currently the site of active erosion\nover the majority of its surface. Thus a major change from\nnet sediment deposition to net erosion has occurred during\nthe Cenozoic, yet there is little information on the timing\nand nature of this event. It is additionally important to note\nthat the Upper Cenozoic strata within the western Sichuan\nBasin lie unconformably over Eocene, Cretaceous, Jurassic,\nand in some cases Triassic strata. This major unconformity\ncan be correlated laterally with the present day basin\nsurface, at which strata from Eocene to Late Paleozoic ages\nare exposed. A significant proportion of the Mesozoic and\nCenozoic stratigraphic section over the entire extent of the\nSichuan Basin has therefore been eroded (Figures 1 and 3).\n3. Previous Low-Temperature\nThermochronology\n[22] A number of previous studies have focused on the\nthermochronology of the Longmen Shan and the Xian-\nshuihe Fault Zone, with the aim of establishing the timing\nand rates of denudation associated with growth of the\nTibetan Plateau in this region. Only limited studies have\nso far been conducted on the detrital sediments of the\nadjacent Sichuan Basin. Apatite fission track studies\n(AFT), supplemented by 40Ar\/39Ar (muscovite and biotite)\nand (U-Th)\/He (apatite and zircon) thermochronology\n(Figure 5), suggest slow regional cooling of the Longmen\nShan occurred since the Jurassic, followed by rapid cooling\nafter the Late Miocene with denudation magnitudes of\nbetween 8 and 10 km and rates of 1\u20132 mm\/a [Arne et al.,\n1997; Kirby et al., 2002]. This regional denudational event\ncan be detected at least as far south as the Xianshuihe Fault\nZone [Xu and Kamp, 2000; Clark et al., 2005], where\nexhumed zircon fission track partial annealing zones and\napatite fission track thermal models indicate that more rapid\ncooling took place after 11 Ma [Kirby et al., 2002]. This\nmiddle to late Miocene increase in cooling has been attrib-\nuted to increased erosion associated with development of\nhigh topography along the plateau margin at this time [Kirby\net al., 2002], and even though this denudation may have\nFigure 5.

RICHARDSON ET AL.: SICHUAN BASIN DENUDATION\n10 of 23\nB04409\nproduced a large quantity of sediment, correlative deposits\nwithin the adjacent Sichuan Basin actually have a minor\nvolume [Kirby et al., 2002]. Thus an important puzzle is to\ndetermine the amount and timing of sediment erosion or\nbypass through the basin during the Cenozoic using both\nonshore (this study) and offshore data sets.\n[23] The sparse low-temperature thermochronological da-\nta that are available for the Sichuan Basin indicate that at\nleast some postdepositional heating of the Mesozoic basin\nsediments has occurred. Arne et al. [1997] described a\nnumber of samples within Triassic to ?Cretaceous sediments\nalong the basin margin that have apatite fission track ages\nthat are less than the sample depositional ages. They\nattributed this to localized heating, while acknowledging\nthat such an interpretation is problematic given the low\ndensity of the sample locations. Xu [1997] also conducted a\nzircon and apatite fission track analysis of boreholes within\nthe western Sichuan Basin and concluded that between 2\nand 3 km of denudation took place during the Neogene.\nMore recently, Enkelmann et al. [2004] noted two detrital\nsamples in the northwestern Sichuan Basin that yielded\nAFT ages less than their Jurassic and Triassic stratigraphic\nages.\n4. Thermochronology\n4.1. Fission Track\n[24] Fission track dating relies upon atomic-scale damage\nto the crystal lattice as a result of 238U spontaneous fission\ndecay within the host mineral, in this case apatite. For\nfission track systems, there are no discrete \u2018\u2018closure\u2019\u2019\ntemperatures as in other radiogenic systems. A transition\ntemperature zone where tracks are essentially unstable is\nrecognized; this is termed the partial annealing zone (PAZ)\nand is defined by upper and lower temperature limits that\nare dependent on cooling rates. The PAZ for apatite lies\nbetween approximately 60\u0001 and 120\u0001C [Laslett et al., 1987;\nCorrigan, 1993] with an effective closure temperature of\n110 \u00b1 10\u0001C. Hence apatite fission track analysis is partic-\nularly useful for evaluating low-temperature thermal histo-\nries, that is, those affecting the upper 3\u20134 km of the crust.\n[25] Throughout this study, we deal with the thermal\nhistory of detrital apatite grains. The fission track method\nallows us to derive information which can reflect not only\nthe thermal history of the sediment in question but also that\nof the hinterland from which the grains have been initially\nderived. A sample that is unreset since deposition will retain\nthe thermal history of the source region and will yield a\nfission track age that is greater than its stratigraphic age\n[e.g., Ruiz et al., 2004]. A sample with partially reset\napatites has been modified by a thermal overprint, thus\nchanging the original detrital age and confined track length\ndistribution. Such partially reset samples may thus contain a\nproportion of individual grains that are less than the\nstratigraphic age, while those that retain the detrital signa-\nture yield ages that are exclusively older than the deposi-\ntional age of the host sediment. The probability of a\npopulation of single grain ages belonging to a single\npopulation is assessed by the chi-square statistic [Galbraith,\n1981]. In general, a chi-square probability of less than 5% is\na good indicator of partially reset or detrital ages. Partially\nreset samples will yield a range of single grain ages that\nmay be younger than, equal to, or older than the sample\u2019s\nstratigraphic age. Detrital samples yield ages exclusively\nolder than the depositional age of the host sediment\n(although sometimes other information may be needed to\nconfirm that these have not suffered some small degree of\nheating yet still maintain an age that is older than the\nstratigraphic age.) Samples that are fully reset have been\nheated to such a degree that no hinterland information is\nretained, the original fission tracks within the sample have\nbeen totally annealed, and the sample (and all individual\ngrains within it) will yield ages that are less than the\nstratigraphic age. Determining the depth at which total\nannealing occurs may require additional information such\nas a suite of downsection samples to establish variations in\nthe degree of downhole annealing.\n4.1.1. Analytical Procedure\n[26] Fission track sample preparation followed routine\ntechniques for separation of apatites [Seward, 1989]. Etching\nof all apatites except those from borehole JP1 was done at\nETH Zurich with 7% HNO3 at 21\u0001C for 50 s. This etch time\nyields similar track length parameters to the etch using 20 s\nin 5N HNO3 [Seward et al., 2000] used in the annealing\nstudies of Laslett et al. [1987] and for the etching of apatites\nfrom borehole JP1 at the University of Melbourne. Musco-\nvite detectors were etched in 40% HF for 45 min at room\ntemperature. All irradiations were carried out at the ANSTO\nfacility, Lucas Heights, Australia. Microscopic analysis was\nundertaken using a Zeiss Axioplan2 optical microscope with\na computer-driven stage and FTstage 4 software from\nDumitru [1995]. All ages were determined using the zeta\napproach [Hurford and Green, 1983] with a zeta value of\n334 \u00b1 9 (Richardson) and 362 \u00b1 8 (Fowler) for CN5\ndosimeters. They are reported throughout this paper as\ncentral ages [Galbraith and Laslett, 1993] with a 2s error\n(Tables 1 and 2). Where possible, at least 20 crystals of each\nsample were counted for age determination. The magnifica-\ntion used was 1250X for determining both apatite track\ndensities and horizontal confined track lengths.\n4.1.2. Modeling\n[27] Temperature-time paths were derived for each mod-\neled sample through inverse Monte Carlo modeling using\nthe HeFTy software of Ketcham [2005]. Since all of the\nsamples used in this study were clastic sediments (sand-\nstones and silty sandstones), consideration of the known\nsedimentary basin history allowed us to place some con-\nstraints on the manner in which they were modeled. As an\ninitial constraint, we allowed the sample to cool from any\ntemperature above, within, or below the PAZ to simulate\nuncertainty in the initial thermal history inherited from the\nsedimentary source. The sample was then constrained to be\nat or near the surface at the approximate time of sedimentary\ndeposition and was then unconstrained between deposition\nand the present day. The track modeling philosophy was to\nTable 2.

Between\nconstraints, paths are monotonic consistent with episodic\nrandomization and halving of the path four times to allow\nfor sufficient variability in the exhumation path.\n[28] The kinetics of fission track annealing have been\nfound in many instances to be a function of chemical\ncomposition [e.g., Gleadow and Duddy, 1981; O\u2019Sullivan\nand Parrish, 1995]. Burtner et al. [1994] have shown that\nthis amounts to a variation in total annealing temperature by\nas much as \u00b1 20\u0001C in extreme cases. The mean track pit\ndiameter of the apatites in this study (1.8\u20135.0 mm within\nsome extreme samples) suggests that the apatites possess a\nrange of chemical compositional variability. Hence we used\nthe annealing model of Ketcham et al. [1999], which takes\ninto account the chemical variability by using the diameter\nof etched tracks at the surface of the apatite (Dpar) as a\nproxy for the annealing kinetics of the grains. The Dpar\nkinetic parameter was also used to calculate initial confined\ntrack lengths. Length corrections were made to account for\nvariability in track length that reflects anisotropy of anneal-\ning and etching dependent on angle to the crystallographic\nC-axis using the method of Ketcham [2003]. The Kolmo-\ngorov-Smirnov statistical test was used to assess the good-\nness of fit between modeled and measured track length\ndistributions, with merit values of 0.5 and 0.05 for good and\nacceptable fits, respectively.\n4.2. (U-Th)\/He Dating\n[29] The (U-Th)\/He dating method is based on the accu-\nmulation of radiogenic helium as a result of a-decay from\nuranium and thorium, and to a smaller extent from samar-\nium, within mineral grains. As with fission tracks, He is\nvariably retained in the crystal within a range of temper-\natures, termed the partial retention zone, that are partly\ndependent on cooling rate. The effective He closure tem-\nperature in apatite has previously been estimated to be 68 \u00b1\n5\u0001C [Wolf et al. 1996; Farley, 2000]. Measured (U-Th)\/He\nages are a reflection of the competing effects of in situ\nradiogenic He production and diffusive loss of He. This\ntechnique is becoming increasingly important in studies of\nexhumation and erosion since it documents cooling within\nthe uppermost portion of the crust.\n4.2.1. Analytical Procedure\n[30] For reliable (U-Th)\/He analysis, sufficiently large\n(>100 mm across), inclusion-free apatite crystals could only\nbe selected from one detrital sample (0835-1), for which\nmultiple grains were analyzed (Table 2). Crystals were\nhandpicked using a binocular microscope under polarized\nlight at 200X magnification and the crystal length and width\nwas measured electronically to allow calculation of the a-\nejection correction according to Farley et al. [1996]. Crys-\ntals were wrapped in pure platinum foil to allow homoge-\nneous heating with an infrared Nd-YAG laser (1064 nm\nwavelength) to temperatures in the range of \u00011100\u0001C for 3\nmin. Gas released inside the laser chamber was expanded\ninto an ultra-high vacuum with H2O and CO2 frozen out\nusing a liquid nitrogen-cooled cold trap, argon trapped on a\ncold charcoal finger, and subsequent cleaning using Ti\/Zr\ngetters. Helium was then measured using a dedicated noble\ngas sector field mass spectrometer (\u2018\u2018Albatross,\u2019\u2019 90\u0001, 21 cm\nradius). Blank measurements were regularly run between\nsamples to allow corrections to be made. Reheating of\napatite grains was performed in order to verify complete\ndegassing. Uranium and thorium contents of the same\ncrystals were subsequently determined by Multiple Collec-\ntor Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (MC-\nICPMS). The degassed crystals were spiked with a\n233U\/229Th solution and digested at \u0001100\u0001C using 1.5N\nHNO3 with trace HF. U and Th were separated using TRU\nion exchange resin (Eichrom), treated using H2O2 and\ndissolved in \u00011 ml 0.3N HNO3-0.1N HF which was\naspirated into the plasma source of a Nu Plasma MC-\nICPMS. Measured isotopic ratios were corrected iteratively\nfor small contributions of natural isotopes present in the\nspike tracer, instrumental mass bias, and ion counter gain.\nFurther analytical details are documented by Wipf [2006].\n5. Results and Interpretation\n5.1. Apatite Fission Track Thermochronology\n[31] Apatite fission track results are shown on the map in\nFigure 6 and are reported in Table 1. All samples of\nCretaceous stratigraphic age yielded fission track central\nages that were older than their depositional age, indicative\nof no or little resetting. All Jurassic and Triassic stratigraph-\nic samples yielded fission track central ages that were less\nthan their depositional age, indicating partial to full resetting\nand a first-order tendency toward younger fission track ages\nat deeper stratigraphic levels. This indicates that there has\nbeen basin-wide thermal heating of these sediments, and the\nfact that older strata are most affected by this fission track\nresetting indicates that the most likely cause is burial by\nsedimentation. Fully reset ages are primarily found within\neroded anticline cores, since these reveal deeply buried\nTriassic rocks which are not otherwise exposed at the basin\nsurface (Figure 6). However, it is important to note that the\nthermal resetting of these samples is unrelated to folding,\nsince fully reset Triassic samples are also found at relatively\nshallow depths in borehole JP1 (Figure 6) and in other\nboreholes within undeformed parts of the basin [Xu, 1997].\n[32] We note that while we present central ages of unreset\nand partially reset samples, the central age of such samples\nmay not be representative of the entire single-grain age\npopulation, as discussed by Vermeesch [2004], and the\nmeaning of such an age is somewhat open to question.\nNevertheless, most ages presented here are partially to fully\nreset and the central apatite ages at least provide a first-order\nindicator of the amount of annealing when considered\ntogether with the stratigraphic age.\n5.1.1. Xiongpo Anticline\n[33] To better illustrate the general pattern of resetting and\nto extract information on the timing and magnitude of burial\nand denudation, we focus on the most complete preserved\nstratigraphic section, exposed in the Xiongpo Anticline in\nthe western Sichuan Basin (Figures 7 and 8). Within this\nsection, the top and base of an exhumed paleopartial\nannealing zone (paleo-PAZ) have been exposed, allowing\nus to put constraints on both the amount of missing\nstratigraphic section, and the timing of the exhumational\nevent. The Xiongpo Anticline (Figure 7) exposes a contin-\nuous section from the Upper Triassic Xujiahe Group\nthrough to the Upper Cretaceous Guankou Formation (and\nB04409 RICHARDSON ET AL.: SICHUAN BASIN DENUDATION\n12 of 23\nB04409\nalong-strike nearby the Eocene Min Shan Formation),\nwhich is unconformably overlain by the late Neogene\n(probably Plio-Pleistocene) Dayi Formation. Because of\nthe uncertainty in the stratigraphic ages of the samples,\nwe have assigned arbitrary but generous error margins of\n\u00b120 Ma to the stratigraphic ages. In the discussion below\nthis error margin is considered.\n[34] The stratigraphically youngest sample within this\nsection (X1, Upper Cretaceous) yields a population of\nsingle grain ages that are generally older than the strati-\ngraphic age (depending on the accuracy of this age) (Figures\n8 and 9). This sample, as with samples X2-X4 in the\nuppermost portion of the section, shows a wide spread in\nsingle grain ages. Samples progressively further down the\nstratigraphic section yield an increasing proportion of single\ngrain ages that are younger than their stratigraphic ages\n(Figures 8 and 9), reflecting an increased degree of resetting\nwith stratigraphic depth. The three stratigraphically oldest\nsamples at the base of the section (samples X5, X6, and X7)\nhave a narrow spread in single grain ages, all of which are\nsignificantly younger than the stratigraphic age (Figures\n8 and 9). On the basis of these observations, it is possible to\nmake an estimate of the bounding limits of the paleo-PAZ.\nThe top of this zone most likely lies between samples X1\nand X2 (approximately 400 to 500 m stratigraphically\nbelow the Cretaceous-Neogene unconformity), while the\nbase is somewhere close to samples X5 and X6 (approxi-\nmately 2500 to 2600 m below the unconformity), where all\nthe detrital ages are clearly very much younger than the\nstratigraphic ages. In addition, the central ages of the\nlowermost three samples decrease systematically with depth\nin accordance with their relative timing of exhumation (as in\nan age-altitude plot). Samples X5 and X6 lie in close\nproximity to the base of an exhumed partial annealing zone.\nWe note that the exact location of the top and base of the\nPAZ is somewhat dependant on uncertainty in the strati-\ngraphic ages of the samples as mentioned above. The\ncontinental strata from which the samples are derived have\nbeen correlated to sections that have been studied using\npaleontological [Liu et al., 1982] and paleomagnetic tech-\nniques [Enkin et al., 1991a, 1991b; Huang and Opdyke,\n1991; Yokoyama et al., 2001]. Although we have given the\nage of the strata a generous error range, we are confident the\napatite fission track ages have been correctly classified as\neither nonreset, partially reset, or fully reset. Importantly,\nthe mean track lengths of horizontal confined fission tracks\n(after correction for C-axis orientation effects) within the\nlowermost samples are relatively long, with mean track\nlengths of 14.09 \u00b1 1.83 mm for sample X6 and 14.25 \u00b1 1.49\nmm for sample X7. Such long track lengths are supportive\nevidence for full annealing of these detrital samples whose\ncentral ages thus reflect purely postdepositional cooling\nFigure 6. New thermochronological data for the Sichuan Basin region (this study). All AFT ages are\ncentral ages and are quoted in Ma with 2-sigma errors. Underlying geology from Figure 1 is shown for\nreference. Red stars indicate fully reset detrital samples (those where all grains within the sample are less\nthan the stratigraphic age), orange numbers indicate partially reset detrital samples (in which only some\nof the grains are less than the stratigraphic age), black numbers indicate slightly to unreset detrital\nsamples (in which all the grains analyzed are older than their stratigraphic age). Blue boxes show\nlocations of samples used in thermal modeling (Figure 10).\nB04409 RICHARDSON ET AL.: SICHUAN BASIN DENUDATION\n13 of 23\nB04409\nthrough the AFT closure temperature. Sample X5 (central\nage 39.8 Ma), which lies closest to the base of the exhumed\npaleo-PAZ, probably most closely reflects the timing of the\nonset of rapid postdepositional cooling.\n5.1.1.1. Magnitude of Exhumation\n[35] The stratigraphic section of the Xiongpo Anticline\nalso allows us to estimate exhumation magnitudes, as the\namount of section between the top and base of the PAZ can\nbe used to derive a geothermal gradient based upon the\ntemperature zone spanned by the PAZ. On the basis of the\nrelative depths of samples X1\/X2 and X5, the PAZ is\napproximately 2 km thick, and since the top of the PAZ\noccurs at \u0001 60\u0001C and the base at \u0001 110\u0001C (i.e., a difference\nof 50\u0001C), the calculated geothermal gradient is 25\u0001C km\u00031.\nWith these assumptions, and given an average surface\ntemperature of 15\u0001C, we would expect temperatures of\n\u000160\u0001C (top of the PAZ) at a depth of approximately 1.8\nkm below the surface and temperatures of \u0001110\u0001C (base of\nthe PAZ) to be reached at a depth of approximately 3.8 km.\nHowever, the top and base of the paleo-PAZ in the mea-\nsured section are only \u0001500 m and \u00012500 m below the\nunconformity, respectively, so there must be stratigraphic\nFigure 7. Detailed geological map of the Xiongpo Anticline. Apatite fission track sample locations are\nmarked with stars and their associated apatite fission track central ages are given in Ma, with 2-sigma\nerrors (selected sample numbers in brackets). See Figure 1 for location. Lower half shows structural cross\nsection A-A\u2019 across the Xiongpo anticline.\nB04409 RICHARDSON ET AL.: SICHUAN BASIN DENUDATION\n14 of 23\nB04409\nmaterial missing from the upper section (Figures 8 and 9).\nOn this basis, the total missing section is approximately 1.3\nkm at this location.\n[36] Although we have assumed in the above calculation\nthat the geothermal gradient is fixed through time, it is more\nlikely to have varied since the Late Triassic, with a\ngeologically conceivable range of 15 to 35\u0001C km\u00031. Taking\nthe extremes within this range, the magnitude of the eroded\nmaterial may be as low as 0.25 km (geothermal gradient of\n35\u0001C km\u00031, base of PAZ at \u00012.75 km) but as high as 4.1\nkm (geothermal gradient of 15\u0001C km\u00031, base of PAZ at\n\u00016.6 km). Present day borehole temperatures for this area\nindicate a geothermal gradient of \u000120\u0001C km\u00031 in the upper\nfew km of the basin [Xie and Yu, 1988] and low heat flow\n[Hu et al., 2000]. In addition, the geothermal gradient has\nprobably not been greatly above this value since the\nformation of the Late Triassic Longmen Shan Foreland\nBasin, when the heat flow was more likely even lower\nbased on comparisons with other foreland basins [Allen and\nAllen, 1990; Schegg and Leu, 1998], due to the lack of any\nsubsequent extensional or volcanic activity in this region.\nSince the geothermal gradient in stable crust is largely a\nfunction of erosion rate, and throughout the Mesozoic the\nbasin was depositional, it is likely therefore that the geo-\nthermal gradient would be on the low side of normal, (i.e.,\nbetween 20 and 25\u0001C km\u00031). Plate interior settings experi-\nencing relatively low erosion rates (\u00011mm\/a) typically have\ngeothermal gradients of less than \u0001 25\u0001C km\u00031 (e.g.,\nColorado Plateau). Total postdepositional denudation of\n1.3 km thus represents a conservative but realistic estimate\nof the amount of material eroded at this location.\n5.1.1.2. Timing of Exhumation\n[37] The onset of cooling can also be constrained by\nmodeling of horizontal confined tracks that were measured\nfor the samples (Figure 10). Here we present a pair of closely\nspaced, fully reset samples from the Xiongpo Anticline\n(samples X6 and X7, central ages 32.9 Ma and 27.5 Ma,\nrespectively), The thermal models for these two samples\nindicate that following deposition (Figure 10, box D), they\nare likely to have reached their maximum burial depth during\nthe Early Tertiary, consistent with the knowledge that they are\ncovered by Jurassic to Eocene sediments (Figures 7 and 8).\nBoth models indicate that following burial, the onset of\ncooling to present-day exposure took place no earlier than\n40 Ma and certainly no later than \u000125 Ma.\n[38] That this cooling event is not the result of focused\nexhumation above the fold can be demonstrated by consid-\neration of the local stratigraphy. On both the eastern and\nwestern limbs of the Xiongpo Anticline, Mesozoic strata are\ncut by an unconformity (disconformity) capped by the\nFigure 8. Single-grain apatite fission track ages for samples across the Xiongpo Anticline plotted\nagainst stratigraphic depth below the Cretaceous-Neogene unconformity. See Figure 7 for sample\nlocations. Squares show the stratigraphic age of each sample. Errors in the stratigraphic ages are assumed\nto be \u00b1 20 Ma and are shown by solid black error bars. Single-grain ages decrease downsection, reflecting\nthe increasing degree of fission track resetting with depth. The range of two-sigma errors for the single\ngrain ages are shown by thin dashed lines. The top of the partial annealing zone is most likely located\nbetween samples X1 and X2 (where the number of single grain ages younger than the stratigraphic age\nstarts to increase). Samples X5, X6, and X7 are defined as being fully reset (since all single grain ages are\nless than the stratigraphic age); therefore the base of the exhumed AFT paleopartial annealing zone lies\nsomewhere close to 2500 m stratigraphically below the unconformity. By assuming a time- and depth-\ninvariant geothermal gradient of 25\u0001C per km and a surface temperature of 15\u0001C, and taking 60\u0001C and\n110\u0001C as the top and base of the AFT partial annealing zone, we calculate that at least 1.3 km of the\nstratigraphic column must be missing.\nB04409 RICHARDSON ET AL.: SICHUAN BASIN DENUDATION\n15 of 23\nB04409\npoorly consolidated Neogene Dayi Formation. As pointed\nout by Burchfiel et al. [1995], dating these Neogene strata is\ncrucial to determining the timing of deformation on the\nXiongpo Anticline. Apatite fission track ages of individual\ndetrital grains within the Neogene strata allow us to place a\nmaximum age on the depositional age. Detrital ages from\nsandstone within the Dayi Formation (Figure 11, Location:\n364967; 393960; 615 m) indicate that these strata are no\nolder than 12 \u00b1 4 Ma, the age of the youngest grain.\nAdditionally, since these Neogene strata are overturned on\nthe western limb of the fold, the deformation must also be\nyounger than \u000112 Ma. The fact that correlative sediments\nare present on the eastern limb of the anticline, which now\nacts as a barrier to sediment supply from the Longmen\nShan, combined with the observation that the Neogene\nsediments do not contain clasts of the underlying formations\nwhich could have been shed off an emergent structure,\nindicates that there was no topographic expression of the\nXiongpo Anticline at the time of sediment deposition.\nErosion and formation of the Cretaceous-Neogene uncon-\nformity therefore predates the folding, and must have\noccurred prior to \u000112 Ma. Thus although focused denuda-\ntion has obviously occurred above the Xiongpo Anticline\nsince \u000112 Ma, formation of the Cretaceous-Neogene un-\nconformity at this location occurred in an earlier exhuma-\ntion event, which most likely initiated during the Middle to\nLate Eocene.\n[39] Samples higher up the stratigraphic section did not\nyield sufficient grains of the requisite quality and crystallo-\ngraphic orientation to allow meaningful analysis of track\nlength distributions through the entire sample suite. In any\nevent, the track length distributions for these samples would\nreflect the inherited detrital track distributions, overprinted\nwith the signature of thermal reheating, and thus the\nderivation of a meaningful thermal history for these samples\nwould be problematic.\n5.1.2. Borehole Data\n[40] An additional suite of samples was obtained from\nborehole JP1 located in the central-northern part of the\nSichuan Basin (Figure 6), geographically removed from\nboth the anticlines within the basin and the structurally\ndeformed margins. The deepest sample, JP1FT4 has a\ncentral age of 25.5 \u00b1 3.8 Ma with a high chi square value\nof 80 and 0 % variation, suggesting that it has been fully\nreset and the age approximates the timing of cooling\nthrough the closure temperature for that site. On the other\nhand, sample JP1FT5 has an apparent age of 47.5 \u00b18 Ma, a\nchi-square value of zero, and a variation of 32%. One\nsingle-grain age in JP1FT5 is older than the estimated\nstratigraphic age, and the mean track length is 12.0 \u00b1 2.6\nmm, suggesting that the sample was not quite fully reset, and\nlies close to the base of the paleo-PAZ. Thus this downhole\ntransect (Figure 12) reveals the base of a paleo-PAZ at\nFigure 9. Radial plots for apatite fission track samples in\nthe Xiongpo area (see Figures 1, 7, and 8 for sample\nlocations). The apatite fission track central age is plotted as\na solid line marked \u2018\u2018AFT,\u2019\u2019 and the stratigraphic age of\neach sample is plotted as a solid line marked \u2018\u2018STRAT.\u2019\u2019\nThis diagram clearly reveals the increasing degree of\nresetting with stratigraphic depth.\nB04409 RICHARDSON ET AL.: SICHUAN BASIN DENUDATION\n16 of 23\nB04409\npresent-day depths of between \u00011650 m and \u00012650 m and\ntemperatures of between \u000148 and \u000168\u0001C, indicating that\nthese strata have undergone significant cooling since they\nreached peak paleotemperatures of around 110\u0001C. This\ncooling is consistent with the removal of \u00012 km of\nsedimentary cover, assuming that the current geothermal\ngradient of \u000118\u0001C km\u00031 is representative of the geological\nhistory of these samples. Hence the initiation of cooling was\nmost likely between the apparent ages of samples JP1FT4\nand JP1FT5 (i.e., between 25.5 \u00b1 8 Ma and 47.5 \u00b1 8 Ma).\nBecause the borehole lies in an undeformed area of the\nSichuan Basin and yet shows broadly similar timing and\nmagnitude of denudation as the Xiongpo Anticline, we\nfurther conclude that resetting of Jurassic and Triassic\nsamples is unlikely to be due to localized erosion of folds.\n5.1.3. Central and Eastern Basin\n[41] We also analyzed an east-west transect of Jurassic\ndetrital surface samples across the center of the basin, away\nfrom the effects of any deformation (samples 1835-3, 1835-4,\nand 1835-5). These samples contain a majority of grains that\nyield AFT ages less than the stratigraphic age of the host\nstrata, with central ages of 62.1 \u00b1 11.6, 119.9 \u00b1 17.6, and\n98.2 \u00b1 20.2 Ma (Figure 6). To be reheated to a degree that\nwould allow such partial resetting, these samples would\nhave been buried to depths in excess of approximately 2 km\nsince their deposition, given assumptions about the geother-\nmal gradient similar to those used for the Xiongpo Anticline\nand for the JP1 samples. This cannot be due to localized\nexhumation, since the samples are far removed from any\nanticlines and are spaced widely across the center of the\nbasin.\n[42] Two sample transects from anticlines in the eastern\nSichuan Basin yielded five dateable samples (2495-1, 2495-2,\n2495-3, 2595-1, and 2595-2, Table 1, Figure 6) in which\nsingle grain ages are also less than the samples\u2019 depositional\nage. Although these samples have a relatively wide spread\nin single grain ages (radial plots; auxiliary material\nFigure S11), all the single grain ages are much younger\nthan the host stratigraphic age, in accordance with being\nfully to almost fully reset after deposition. The mean lengths\nof 2495-3 and 2495-1 are 13.68 and 13.47 mm, respectively,\nwith no track lengths smaller than 9 mm, also supporting the\nnotion of full resetting after deposition. These lengths and\nthe wide spread in the radial plots reflect slow cooling\nthrough the PAZ since the Cretaceous, and this is demon-\nstrated in thermal models of two of these samples (samples\n2495-1 and 2495-3, central ages 54.1 and 72.1 Ma, respec-\ntively; Figure 10). These two inverse thermal models\nexhibit a slightly different cooling history compared to\nthose in the Xiongpo Anticline, with the onset of relatively\nslow cooling through the lowermost PAZ during the Mid-\ndle-Late Cretaceous, followed by an increase in cooling rate\nsometime after 40 Ma, as indicated by the break in slope of\nthe cooling pathway. This break in slope is necessary to\nproduce a statistically acceptable model fit; constant cooling\nsince about 70 Ma is outside the bounds of what is possible\naccording to the models. This Middle to Late Eocene\nchange in cooling rate is consistent with the changes\nidentified across other parts of the basin. The slower\nthermal cooling that initiated before this time in the eastern\nSichuan Basin may reflect the initiation of compressional\ntectonics and associated erosion within the Hunan-Guangxi-\nEastern Sichuan fold belt, which is consistent with the study\nof Yan et al. [2003].\n[43] The Middle to Late Eocene change in cooling rates\nacross broad areas of the central and eastern Sichuan Basin\ndemonstrates that significant denudation extended over a\nlarge area and was of a magnitude sufficient enough to bring\npartially and fully reset rocks at the surface.\n5.2. (U-Th)\/He Dating\n[44] To extend the thermal histories derived above to\nlower temperatures, four grains from one sample locality\nwere analyzed using the (U-Th)\/He method. The samples\nwere all derived from a coarse-grained Jurassic sandstone at\nthe southern end of the Longquan Anticline (Figures 1 and 6).\nSingle-grain ages for the sample are 11.52 \u00b1 0.27, 15.66 \u00b1\n0.23, 15.83 \u00b1 0.40, and 154.24 \u00b1 4.32 Ma (Table 2). The first\nthree ages are, as expected, younger than the detrital apatite\nfission track age for the same sample (32.3 \u00b1 6 Ma),\nconsistent with full resetting of the sample and cooling\nthrough both the PAZ and the apatite He partial retention\nzone during Cenozoic denudation. The latter age is anoma-\nlously high and probably does not represent a true cooling\nage because it is much older than the apatite fission track age.\nThis may be due to a number of factors including zonation or\nimplantation with helium (see Fitzgerald et al. [2006] for a\nfull discussion).\n6. Discussion\n[45] Our results demonstrate that widespread erosion of at\nleast 1.3 km magnitude has taken place across the Sichuan\nBasin at some point after the late Middle to Late Eocene.\nThroughout the Mesozoic, the basin accumulated sediment\nderived from the enclosing mountains. The Sichuan Basin,\nhowever, is now hydrologically and sedimentologically\nopen, drained by the Yangtze River and its tributaries, with\nmuch of the basin floor characterized by nondeposition or\nerosion. Thus a major change in the drainage system of the\nSichuan Basin must have occurred since the Early Tertiary.\nBelow, we summarize evidence for widespread denudation\nin the Sichuan Basin, outline potential mechanisms by\nwhich this could have occurred and describe the effects of\nthis denudation on areas to the east and west of the basin.\n6.1. Evidence for Widespread Denudation\n[46] Our low-temperature thermochronological data al-\nlow us to constrain the magnitude, areal extent, and time of\ninitiation of Cenozoic erosion. Detrital apatite fission track\nsamples from Jurassic and Triassic strata across the basin\nrepeatedly exhibit AFT grain ages that are less than the\ndepositional age of the host strata. The degree of resetting\nalone indicates the maximum temperature (and therefore\nthe depth) to which a sample has been subjected. Samples\nwhich are partially thermally reset indicate maximum\npaleotemperatures of >60\u0001C (equivalent to burial of \u00012 km\nand possibly more), and those which are fully reset indicate\nmaximum paleotemperatures of >110\u0001C (equivalent to\nburial below \u00014.5 km depth). Since such thermally reset\nsamples are exposed at the current surface of the basin, the1Auxiliary materials are available in the HTML. doi:10.1029\/\n2006JB004739.\nB04409 RICHARDSON ET AL.: SICHUAN BASIN DENUDATION\n17 of 23\nB04409\nthickness of sedimentary material removed from much of\nthe basin must equal or exceed these values. Stratigraphic\nsections allow us to further constrain both the timing and\nmagnitude of the cooling event. Apatite fission track ages\nof reset samples and thermal models from within the basin\nindicate that exhumation was initiated at some time after\nabout 40 Ma.\n[47] Other indications that a large amount of sedimentary\nmaterial has been removed from the Sichuan Basin come\nfrom ongoing petroleum exploration studies. Although\nhigher than expected vitrinite reflectance measurements\nhave been noted by Chinese petroleum geologists for the\nlast few decades, this was previously considered to be a\nresult of much higher than present geothermal gradients [Wu\nand Wu, 1998]. We discount this on the basis that the\nwestern and northern margins of the basin have acted as\nforeland basins since the Late Triassic and must therefore\nhave had commensurately low geothermal gradients from\nthis point in time onward. The Sichuan Basin has not\nexperienced any major extensional or volcanic events for\nat least the last 250 Ma, and so the geothermal gradient\nprobably remained fairly low, and presumably close to a\nvalue of 20 to 25\u0001C km\u00031, typical for such a continental\ninterior setting. The most feasible option to explain such\nwidespread elevated paleotemperatures must therefore be\nheating during burial, followed by cooling due to erosion.\nBackstripping of borehole data [Korsch et al., 1997] sug-\ngests that maximum burial probably occurred in Late\nCretaceous to Early Tertiary time, shortly before the initi-\nation of the basin-wide erosional event constrained by our\ndata to <40 Ma.\n[48] Finally, geological evidence supports the notion of\nwidespread, post-Cretaceous to post-Eocene erosion.\nThrough the Phanerozoic, the Sichuan Basin developed as\na sedimentary depocenter enclosed on all sides by orogens.\nAreas within the basin have remained undeformed except at\nrelatively shallow crustal levels (for example in the eastern\nSichuan fold and thrust belt). In contrast, major compressive\nand transpressive deformation has occurred on all four\nboundaries of the Sichuan Basin since the Triassic. Deposits\nin the sedimentary basin have been continental since the\nlatest Triassic, and both Jurassic and Cretaceous sediments\nare of alluvial fan, fluvial, and lacustrine facies types, with a\nsignificant proportion of the material derived from the\nsurrounding topographic highs and no evidence of sediment\nbypass through the basin at this time.\nFigure 10. Monte Carlo inverse temperature-time models\nand track length histograms (corrected lengths) for confined\ntrack measurements from samples X6, X7, 2495-3, and\n2495-1 using the HeFTy software of Ketcham [2005]. See\ntext for discussion. Initiation of more rapid Cenozoic\ncooling occurs after 40 Ma. The sample is constrained to at-\nor near-surface temperatures at the time of sedimentary\ndeposition (box labeled D), and at the present day, but we\nhave allowed the model a large degree of freedom in\nchoosing the cooling and burial path between these surface\nconstraint points (large black boxes). Details of modeling\noptions used are outlined in methods section. The dark grey\nfield in each model shows the envelope of possible good fit\npaths and the light grey field shows the envelope of possible\nacceptable fit paths, defined by merit values of 0.5 and 0.05,\nrespectively. MTL is the C-axis corrected mean track length\n(error 1-sigma). Age is the central age in Ma, with 2-sigma\nerrors.\nB04409 RICHARDSON ET AL.: SICHUAN BASIN DENUDATION\n18 of 23\nB04409\n[49] Subsequently, the transition to an erosive regime led\nto the situation where Cretaceous (and Eocene) strata now\nonly crop out on the westernmost boundaries of the\nSichuan Basin, with a corresponding reduction in strati-\ngraphic thickness toward the present-day fluvial exit of the\nbasin at the Three Gorges (Figure 3d). It is clear that much\nof this younger stratigraphy has been eroded over a large\nproportion of the Sichuan Basin, such that progressively\nolder strata crop out toward the east (Figure 1), with the\ncurrent basin surface being an erosional horizon. Only to\nthe west of the Longquan Anticline is this erosional\nsurface represented as an unconformity, between Neogene\nand Quaternary strata and the subcropping Eocene, Creta-\nceous and, to a lesser extent, Jurassic and Triassic strata.\nThe Neogene and Quaternary sediments owe their pres-\nence in the Chengdu subbasin to the Longquan Anticline\n[Burchfiel et al., 1995], which acts as a sediment dam. The\nremainder of the Sichuan Basin continued to be erosional\ninto modern times, as evidenced by the lack of Quaternary\ndeposits.\n6.2. Mechanisms for Basin Erosion\n[50] The mechanism by which such a large quantity of\nsedimentary rock could have been removed from the basin\nalmost certainly involves the Yangtze River and its tributar-\nies. The present-day Yangtze River clearly has enormous\ncapacity to transport sediment, with measured mean sedi-\nment loads of 527.2 Mt a\u00031 at the eastern exit of the Three\nGorges (Yichang) between 1950 and 1986, before closure\nof the Three Gorges dam [Higgitt and Lu, 2001; Xu et al.,\n2006]. This is equivalent to removal of a 2 km thick layer\nof sedimentary rock over the \u0001225,000 km2 surface area of\nthe basin within approximately 2 Ma (assuming a bulk\nrock density of 2200 kg m\u00032). It seems equally clear that\nthe transition from sedimentologically closed basin con-\nditions in the Mesozoic to the present throughgoing Yang-\ntze River system must have involved significant drainage\nreorganization at some point in the Cenozoic. This drain-\nage reorganization was most likely accompanied by a\nlowering of base level, leading to the initiation of erosion\nof the basin fill. Whilst the triggers of, and the processes\nleading to, such continent-scale drainage changes are not\nfully understood, physiographic and geologic evidence\nallows us to consider possible theoretical mechanisms for\nthis reorganization.\nFigure 11. Radial plot for apatite grains from Neogene\nsand sample 300303-6.\nFigure 12. Single-grain apatite fission track ages (circles) for samples in Borehole JP1 (Figure 6)\nplotted against drilled depth below the present day topographic surface. Squares and thick dashed line\nshow the stratigraphic age of each sample. Single grain ages decrease downsection, reflecting the\nincreasing degree of fission track resetting with depth. Two-sigma error bars for single grain ages are\nshown by thin dashed lines. Errors in the stratigraphic ages are assumed to be \u00b120 Ma and are shown by\nsolid black error bars.\nB04409 RICHARDSON ET AL.: SICHUAN BASIN DENUDATION\n19 of 23\nB04409\n[51] The first of these mechanisms, proposed by Barbour\n[1936] and further developed by Clark et al. [2004],\ninvolves a Middle Yangtze River draining to the southwest\nthat was initially distinct from the eastward draining Lower\nYangtze River. Clark et al. [2004] postulated that the\noriginal drainage divide between the Lower and Middle\nYangtze lay at the present position of the Three Gorges. In\nthis model, all the major rivers of the eastern Tibetan\nPlateau initially drained generally southward into the South\nChina Sea. The flow of the Middle Yangtze River was\n\u2018\u2018reversed\u2019\u2019 through gradual headward erosion by the\nLower Yangtze River through the Three Gorges region,\nresulting in a major peturbation to the entire East Asian\nfluvial system. Successive river captures then occurred\nfrom east to west, progressively integrating more westerly\nrivers into the catchment of the growing Yangtze River as\nheadward erosion progressed [Clark et al., 2004]. Presum-\nably, the adjustment of the Sichuan Basin area to a new\nbase level set by the Lower Yangtze in the east would have\nbeen accompanied by an extensive change in erosion\npatterns.\n[52] An alternative but equally feasible model involves\nthe transition from internal to external drainage within\nSichuan Basin itself. Rather than initial headward erosion\nas the cause, we suggest that filling and spilling of the\nbasin\u2019s contents through the site of the Three Gorges may\nhave led to linkage with the Lower Yangtze and rapid\nincision at the basin\u2019s new outlet. If the Sichuan Basin\nwas accumulating sediment through the Mesozoic and into\nPaleogene time, it probably became topographically elevat-\ned relative to the subsiding, extensional Jianghan and\nDongting Basins to the east [Ulmishek, 1992]. Filling of\nthe basin would inevitably have progressed to a critical level\nwhere spilling of either the sedimentary fill or an associated\nlake resulted in breaching of the topographic barrier at the\neastern boundary of the basin. This would have led to a\nsudden increase in discharge at the new drainage exit of the\nbasin, resulting not only in incision through the former\nbarrier but also an increase in discharge to the east of this\npoint into the Lower Yangtze. Consequently, a knickpoint\nwould have migrated headward into the Sichuan Basin,\nresulting in erosion of the basin\u2019s sedimentary fill. This\nheadward migration would likely have caused capture and\ndiversion of drainage within the Sichuan Basin; in other\nwords, these two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive,\nand it seems probable that some combination was respon-\nsible for the large-scale redirection of the Middle Yangtze\nthrough the Three Gorges and into the Lower Yangtze.\nAlthough we cannot distinguish between the two mecha-\nnisms with our data, note that the end result in both\nscenarios is the same, integration of the Sichuan Basin into\nthe Yangtze River drainage basin and erosion within the\nbasin in response to lowered base level.\n[53] Such fill and spill processes are a well-documented\noccurrence in sedimentary basins in a variety of environ-\nmental settings and on a variety of scales [e.g., Einsele and\nHinderer, 1997; Sinclair and Tomasso, 2002; Sobel et al.,\n2003]. A notable example is the Ebro Basin of northeastern\nSpain, which was internally drained from ca. 40 Ma to\n11.5 Ma, when the Catalan Coastal Range was breached by\nthe Ebro River and the predominantly lacustrine sediments\nof the previously enclosed basin were eroded into the\nValencia Trough [Garcia-Castellanos et al., 2003]. Exam-\nples also exist of internally drained basins which may at a\nfuture stage become incorporated into an external drainage\nnetwork, particularly the Tarim and Qaidam Basins in\nNorthern Tibet. Passages from internally to externally\ndrained conditions have also been linked with changes from\ndryer to wetter climates [Sobel et al., 2003].\n6.3. Implications for the Eastern Tibetan Plateau\nand Three Gorges Regions\n[54] The contrast in erodability of the strata within the\nSichuan Basin compared to the lithologies exposed in one\nof the adjacent orogens, the Longmen Shan, would also\nhave led to a contrast in erosion across this mountain front.\nHigher erosion rates in the Sichuan Basin would have\nresulted in more rapid lowering of the basin, thereby\nincreasing the relief across this margin without any need\nfor crustal shortening or lower-crustal flow. As a conse-\nquence, focused erosion along the Longmen Shan could\nalso be expected, whether or not a high plateau margin had\nbeen established in Eastern Tibet at this time. For these\nreasons, it is dangerous to correlate geomorphic surfaces\nacross the margin. Our research suggests that there is a\ndiscrepancy in the timing of the initiation of enhanced\nexhumation in the Longmen Shan (<12 Ma) [Arne et al.\n1997, Kirby et al., 2002] and that within the Sichuan Basin\n(<40 Ma). This could possibly be explained by (1) focused\ncooling along the mountain front, which is only detectable\nthrough detailed sampling for low-temperature thermochro-\nnology, or, more probably, (2) the older event may only be\nobserved in the cooling history of higher temperature\nthermochronometers (e.g., zircon fission track), since the\nAFT paleo-PAZ for this event has probably already been\neroded along the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau [Xu\nand Kamp, 2000; Kirby et al., 2002].\n[55] An explanation as to why the Yangtze exits the\nSichuan Basin in the east may be because it represented\nthe lowest topographic point in any of the barriers around\nthe basin at the time. Although the Yangtze River exhibits\nsome characteristics typical of antecedence within the basin,\nsuch as cutting across anticlines [Simpson, 2004], in the\nmajority of locations it is controlled by tectonic structures,\nflowing parallel to strike. Certainly, the convergence of the\nmajor southwest-northeast structural trends of the Hunan-\nGuangxi fold belt and the northwest-southeast structural\ntrends of the Daba Shan fold and thrust belt to form the\nprimarily east-west trends of the Three Gorges region\n(Figure 1) must have been a first-order control and may\nhave led to the subsequent \u2018\u2018funneling\u2019\u2019 of drainage chan-\nnels along this trend.\n[56] If cooling of strata within the Sichuan Basin was\nindeed initiated by the formation of a major drainage route\nthrough the Three Gorges region, then such an event should\nalso be chronicled by the initiation of erosion and rapid\ncooling within the Gorges themselves. We would expect\nthat the age of this cooling event would be equivalent to, or\nslightly older than, the <40 Ma event that is exhibited by\nour apatite fission track data within the basin. Previous\nattempts to provide time constraints on the cutting of the\nThree Gorges have only provided dates on terrace deposits\nat the western end of the gorges using techniques that do not\nhave the range to date back to the Early-Middle Tertiary\nB04409 RICHARDSON ET AL.: SICHUAN BASIN DENUDATION\n20 of 23\nB04409\n[e.g., Li et al., 2001]. A more promising avenue of future\nresearch may be the sedimentary record of gorge incision\nand basin denudation within onshore and offshore basins\nthat lie downstream of the Three Gorges. A critical test of\nour hypothesis would involve an integrated sedimentary\nstudy (geochronology, sediment budgets, geochemical prov-\nenance, etc.) of basins downstream from the Jianghan\nBasin, immediately east of the Three Gorges, down to the\nEast China Sea. The removal of so much mass from the\nlithosphere may also mean that there are other, detectable\nfar-field tectonic implications due to unloading.\n[57] In summary, we propose that the initial establishment\nof the Yangtze River through the Three Gorges was the\nmost likely trigger of increased erosion rates within the\nSichuan Basin and its hinterland regions. The basin re-\nsponse to this reorganization involved stripping of highly\nerodable basin sediments as a result of knickpoint propaga-\ntion headward from the newly established gorge into the\npreviously sedimentologically enclosed (if not hydrologi-\ncally enclosed) basin. The lowering of base level within the\nbasin by >2 km also resulted in enhanced erosion rates in\nthe river valleys of the surrounding orogens and renewed\nheadward propagation within the corresponding drainages.\nThe perturbation to the fluvial network resulting from\nincision of the Three Gorges may have been the trigger\nfor subsequent drainage captures. The most notable capture\nevent of this type within the Yangtze drainage basin is that\nof the Upper Yangtze from the Red River by the Middle\nYangtze [Clark et al., 2004] and this is reflected in the\noffshore clastic sedimentary record [Clift, 2006]. Recent\nresults from the Yinggehai-Song Hong Basin, Gulf of\nTonkin in the Red River offshore region indicate a signif-\nicant change in the eNd values of the sediment toward the\nend of the Eocene, perhaps reflecting this capture event\n[Clift and Sun, 2006, X. Clift, personal communication,\n2004]. Thus the Middle and Lower Yangtze domains must\nhave already been integrated by this time. This is in\nagreement with the timing of cooling interpreted as ero-\nsional events from our new data set.\n7. Conclusions\n[58] The Sichuan Basin is located immediately to the east\nof the Tibetan Plateau, in a strategically important location\nfor assessing tectonic models of plateau formation and\nstudying major drainage changes that occurred on the Asian\ncontinent during the Cenozoic. Apatite fission track analysis\nof detrital sediments within the Sichuan Basin reveals that a\npaleopartial annealing zone is exposed over a large area of\nthe Sichuan Basin, indicating widespread exhumation of the\nbasin following a long period of Late Triassic to Eocene\ncontinental deposition. Apatite fission track stratigraphic-\nage profiles, combined with thermal history modeling of the\nsamples, allow us to constrain the initiation of the related\ncooling event to some time after 40 Ma. Additionally, we\ncan put bounds on the thickness of sedimentary material that\nwas removed from the basin at between 1.3 and 4 km.\n[59] The remaining Mesozoic stratigraphy within the\nSichuan Basin indicates that until at least the Late Creta-\nceous, the basin was internally drained and enclosed on all\nsides by mountains. Since the basin is now drained by the\nYangtze River and a number of major tributaries, the\ntransition from internal to external drainage must have\noccurred during the Cenozoic, and this reorganization was\nthe likely trigger for large-magnitude erosion within the\nbasin indicated by the fission track data. We hypothesize\nthat the stimulus for this event was the integration of the\nMiddle Yangtze and Lower Yangtze Rivers through the\nThree Gorges area, resulting in increased erosion rates that\npropagated headward through the Sichuan Basin and in\nsubsequent capture events to the west. The knock-on effects\nof this event may have included an increase in relief at the\nmargins of the basin, including the Longmen Shan; gorge\nincision; and major drainage reorganizations that occurred\nthroughout Southeast Asia.\n[60] Acknowledgments.
