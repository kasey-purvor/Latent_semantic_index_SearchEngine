Here, the effect of treatment with growth-\ninhibitory doses of the anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) on the incorporation of FDG\nby breast tumor cells was measured along with hexokinase (HK) and glucose transport to determine the potential of FDG-positron\nemission tomography in predicting response to these biological anti-cancer therapies and their modulatory effects on the steps involved in\nFDG incorporation.\nMethods: The sensitivity to trastuzumab of three breast tumor cell lines, SKBr3, MDA-MB-453 and MDA-MB-468, expressing human\nepidermal growth factor receptor-2 at high, medium and low levels, respectively, was determined using MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-\n2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay over a 6-day period, and a clonogenic assay was carried out after 7- and 10-day exposures. FDG\nincorporation by cells treated with growth-inhibitory doses of trastuzumab was carried out after 4 h and 2, 4 and 6 days of treatment. Glucose\ntransport (rate of uptake of the non-metabolizable analogue [3H]O-methyl-D-glucose), HK activity and lactate production were measured on\ncells treated with inhibitory doses of trastuzumab for 6 days.\nResults: The IC50 doses for SKBr3 and MDA-MB-453 and the IC20 dose for MDA-MB-468 after 6 days of treatment with trastuzumab were\n0.25, 1 and 170 \u03bcg\/ml, respectively. FDG incorporation by SKBr3 and MDA-MB-453 cells was found to be decreased using IC50 doses of\ntrastuzumab for 6 days. At the IC50 doses, FDG incorporation was also decreased at 4 days and, in the case of MDA-MB-453, even after 4 h\nof treatment. Decreased FDG incorporation corresponded with decreased HK activity in these cells. Lactate production, previously suggested\nto be a potential measure of response, was found to be significantly decreased by SKBr3 and MDA-MB-453 cells responding to trastuzumab.\nConclusion: FDG incorporation at the tumor cell level is modulated by treatment with growth-inhibitory doses of trastuzumab due to\nmodulation of HK activity. Changes in lactate production may also be a useful determinant of response to trastuzumab.\n\u00a9 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Keywords: Trastuzumab; FDG; PET; Hexokinase; Lactate1.

The\namplification of HER-2 (ErbB2\/neu), observed in several\ncancer types [1], is associated with resistance to apoptosis,\nenhanced proliferation, cell migration and invasiveness.\nAbout 25% of cases of breast cancer exhibit HER-2\noverexpression, which is strongly associated with poor\nprognosis [2]. These patients derive clinical benefit from\ntreatment with the HER-2-targeting antibody trastuzumab\n(Herceptin) [3]. However, trastuzumab is very expensive,\n340 R.W. Cheyne et al. \/ Nuclear Medicine and Biology 38 (2011) 339\u2013346and it produces cardiac complications [4] in some patients,\nespecially when administered with anthracyclines. Further-\nmore, HER-2-negative cells have been shown to exhibit little\nor no response to the drug [5].\nIt is recommended [6] that overexpression of HER-2\nshould be evaluated on every primary breast cancer to predict\nwhich patients may benefit from trastuzumab. This is\ndetermined using either fluorescent in situ hybridization or\nimmunohistochemistry on biopsy specimens taken from the\nprimary tumor. However, this approach may not provide\nglobally representative information on either the primary\ntumor or metastasis, which can exhibit an HER-2 status\ndifferent from the primary tumor [7], or the likelihood of its\nresponse to trastuzumab.\nAn alternative approach to tumor therapy response\nprediction is the use of positron emission tomography\n(PET) to monitor changes in tracer incorporation during the\ncourse of treatment. 2-[18F]-Fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose\n(FDG) is the most commonly utilized PET tracer with\navailability at all PET centers. The use of serial FDG-PET\nscans in cancer patients during the course of chemotherapy\nhas been demonstrated by many studies to be a useful tool in\ncancer management [8]. Generally, compared with pre-\ntreatment, responding tumors show decreased FDG uptake\nwithin a few days of starting chemotherapy. Two recent\nstudies of human tumor xenografts [9,10] have produced\nconflicting findings regarding the effect of response to\ntrastuzumab on FDG incorporation. McLarty et al. [9]\nshowed that treatment of MDA-MB-361 cells, which\noverexpress HER-2, exhibited a decline in FDG incor-\nporation, whereas MDA-MB-231 cells, which do not\noverexpress HER-2, showed no change in FDG incorpora-\ntion. However, in the study by Shah et al. [10], FDG\nincorporation by trastuzumab-treated MMTV\/HER-2 and\nBT474 cells was found not to accompany response.\nNeither study carried out in vitro studies to assist in under-\nstanding the effect of trastuzumab FDG incorporation at\nthe tumor cell level.\nTo understand the importance of time and dose of anti-\nHER-2 antibodies on FDG incorporation at the tumor cell\nlevel, we have measured FDG incorporation in the breast\ntumor cells SKBr3 [which overexpress HER-2 at a high\nlevel (900 ng\/mg)], MDA-MB-453 [which overexpress\nHER-2 at a medium level (100 ng\/ml)] and MDA-MB-468\n(which do not overexpress HER-2) [11] at various time\npoints during treatment with growth-inhibitory doses of\ntrastuzumab. Akt is a downstream effector of HER-2 and is\nknown to influence the activity of hexokinase (HK) [12]\nand mitochondrial membrane potential. Therefore, we\ndetermined HK activity and lactate production during\ntreatment with trastuzumab. Glucose transport was also\nmeasured due to its important role in FDG uptake. Growth\ninhibition was determined using MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthia-\nzol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assays and ver-\nified using the clonogenic assay, the gold standard for\nmeasuring therapeutic efficacy.2. Materials and methods\nAll chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Poole,\nUK) unless otherwise stated. Cell lines were obtained from\nAmerican Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA).\n2.1. Cells and treatments\nSKBr3, MDA-MB-453 and MDA-MB-468 cells were\ncultured in DMEM (with Glutamax) (Invitrogen, Paisley,\nUK) and supplemented with 50 U\/ml of penicillin, 50 \u03bcg\/ml\nof streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum. During drug\nincubation periods for the FDG uptake, glucose transport,\nHK and lactate assays, media changes were carried out on\nDay 4.\n2.2. Cell viability\n2.2.1. MTT assay\nCells were grown until confluent in 75-cm2 flasks, and\nafter trypsinization and addition of medium, the cell numbers\nwere corrected to 15,000\/ml for the SKBr3 and MDA-MB-\n453 cells and 7500\/ml for the faster-growing MDA-MB-468\ncells. One hundred microliters of cell suspension was seeded\ninto 96-well plates, and the plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C\novernight. Medium (100 \u03bcl) supplemented with varying\nconcentrations of trastuzumab to produce final concentra-\ntions within the ranges of 0.001\u20130.25 \u03bcg\/ml for SKBr3,\n0.025\u20135 \u03bcg\/ml for MDA-MB-453 and 1\u2013250 \u03bcg\/ml for\nMDA-MB-468 was then added to each well (200 \u03bcl\/well in\ntotal), and the plate was returned to the incubator. A\nbackground of 200 \u03bcl of medium and a control of 200 \u03bcl of\nmedium and cells were also set up. After 6 days, 50 \u03bcl of\nMTT was added to each of the wells and incubated for 3\u20134 h.\nThe media were then aspirated using a syringe, and 200 \u03bcl\nof dimethylsulfoxide was then added to each well. Each\nplate was then placed in a scanning multi-well spectropho-\ntometer (Dynatech MR5000, Dynatech Laboratories, Chan-\ntilly, VA, USA) and agitated for 30 s prior to measuring\nspectrophotometric absorbance at 570 nm (test filter=570\nnm, reference filter=690 nm). The plates were analyzed\nusing Biolinx 2.0 software (Biolinx 2.0, Dynatech Labora-\ntories). The absorbance at each treatment concentration\nwas calculated as a percentage of that for the control cells.\nThe MTT assay was carried out in four separate experiments,\nthe data were pooled and a curve of trastuzumab concentra-\ntion vs. relative absorbance was used to determine IC values\n(Fig. 1).\n2.2.2. Colony formation\nThe ability of SKBr3 and MDA-MB-453 cells treated\ncontinuously with trastuzumab (IC20 and IC50) and MDA-\nMB-468 cells treated with trastuzumab (IC10 and IC20) to\nproliferate was determined by seeding cells into 25-cm2\ntissue culture flasks (20,000 per flask) and determining the\nnumber of cells that form colonies of at least 25 cells after\n7 days and at least 50 cells by 10 days (results are expressed\nrelative to the number in control flasks).

The total colonies per flask were then\nexpressed as the percentage of total colonies formed in the\ncontrol flasks. Controls and all treatments were set up with\nfour replicates.\n2.2.3. FDG incorporation\nCells were seeded in 25-cm2 tissue culture flasks and\n3 days later treated with requisite doses of trastuzumab for\n4 h, 2 days, 4 days and 6 days. At the time of FDG uptake\ndetermination, medium was replaced with 1 ml of fresh\nmedium [glucose concentration=1 mg\/ml (5 mM), as this is\nabout the same glucose concentration found in serum from a\nnon-diabetic subject] containing 37 KBq of FDG and\nincubated for 20 min at 37\u00b0C. Cells were then washed five\ntimes with 5 ml of ice-cold PBS and detached by addition of\ntrypsin. After addition of medium to neutralize the trypsin,\n0.8 ml of cell suspension was transferred into microcen-\ntrifuge (Eppendorf) tubes for determination of FDG uptake\nin a well counter. The cells were then centrifuged and\nwashed with 1 ml of PBS, the pellet was dissolved in 0.1 ml\nNaOH (1 M) and protein content was determined after\nneutralizing with 0.1 ml HCl. Protein content was deter-\nmined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Sigma,\nPoole, UK). The uptake of FDG was normalized by dividing\nby protein content. Uptake by treated cells was then\nexpressed as the percentage of uptake by control cells.\n2.2.4. Glucose transport\nGlucose transport rate was determined by incubating cells\nwith [3H]O-methyl-D-glucose ([3H]OMG), and the amount\ntaken up before equilibrium occurred was considered to be a\nmeasure of glucose transport, determined.\nFlasks of cells were seeded as for FDG uptake. At the\ntime of glucose transport determination, medium was\nremoved and replaced with fresh medium (glucose concen-\ntration=1 mg\/ml) containing 37 KBq of [3H]OMG and\n0.1 mM \u201ccold\u201d OMG for 5 and 10 s. The incubation was\nended by rapid addition of 5 ml of ice-cold PBS containing\nthe glucose transport inhibitor phloretin (0.1 mM) followedby three further rapid washes. Cells were then trypsinized,\nhalf of them added to 5 ml of Optima Gold scintillation fluid\n(Perkin Elmer, UK), and [3H]OMG uptake was determined\nin a scintillation counter. The remaining cells were prepared\nfor protein assay. The uptake of [3H] during the 5- and 10-s\nperiods was normalized by dividing by total protein content\nof cells in each flask. Values for the treated cells were then\nexpressed as the percentage of uptake by control cells.\n2.2.5. HK activity\nCells were seeded in 75-cm2 flasks and after treatment\nwith trastuzumab for 6 days harvested by trypsinization.\nAfter addition of medium, they were collected into\nmicrocentrifuge (Eppendorf) tubes, washed with PBS and\ncentrifuged at 400g for 1 min, and the pellet was resuspended\nin 0.2 ml of homogenization buffer (10 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH\n7.7, 0.25 mM sucrose, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM\naminohexanoic acid and 1 mM PMSF). They were then\ntransferred to a 1-ml glass Dounce homogenizer and\nhomogenized by 10 strokes at 4\u00b0C. The homogenized cells\nwere transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged\nfor 10 min at 800g to remove cell debris. The supernatant\nwas transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube, the pellet was\nwashed with 0.2 ml of homogenization buffer and the\nsupernatant was pooled. Protein content of the homogenate\nwas determined on a 20-\u03bcl sample.\nEnzyme activity was determined by addition of 100 \u03bcl\nof homogenate to 0.9 ml of assay medium consisting of\n100 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM glucose, 0.4 mM\nNADP+, 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM ATP and 0.15 U of glucose-\n6-phosphate dehydrogenase in a cuvette at 37\u00b0C. The\nreaction was followed by monitoring the change in\nabsorbance at 340 nm due to the formation of NADPH.\nThe change in absorbance was normalized by dividing by\nprotein content of the homogenate. HK activity by treated\ncells was then expressed as the percentage of HK activity of\ncontrol cells.\n2.2.6. Lactate production\nCells were set up and treated for 6 days as for glucose\nuptake determination. The cells were then washed with PBS\n(4\u00d7) and then incubated for 30 min with DMEM medium\n(containing 1 mg\/ml of glucose). The medium was then\nremoved and stored at \u221220\u00b0C until lactate was assayed. Cells\nwere then trypsinized and prepared for protein assay as for\nFDG incorporation. Lactate was assayed in the medium\nusing a lactate assay kit (BioVision, CA, USA) following the\nmanufacturer's directions. Lactate concentration in nano-\nmoles produced during the 30-min incubation was normal-\nized by dividing by protein content of the flask. Production\nof lactate by treated cells was expressed as a percentage of\nthat by control cells.\n2.3. Statistics and replicates\nSignificant differences between means were established\nusing Student's t test.

Discussion\nThe purpose of this study was to determine how FDG\nincorporation was modulated during response of breast\ntumor cells to treatment with trastuzumab, which targets\nHER-2. Three tumor cell lines expressing HER-2 at high,\nmedium and low\/negative levels were employed in this\nstudy in common with controls utilized in studies of the\nassessment of suitability of breast tumors for treatment with\ntrastuzumab [13].\nIn the clinic, trastuzumab is administered to patients on a\nweekly basis, maintaining a steady-state serum concentration\nof 50\u201360 \u03bcg\/ml [14]. Sensitivity of cells to trastuzumab was\ndetermined using the MTT assay after drug exposure over a\n6-day period as shorter exposure times did not produce a\ndose inhibition of 50% even in the most sensitive cell line\n(SKBr3). The dose of trastuzumab causing 50% growth\ninhibition was lowest for the SKBr3 cells, which exhibit the\ngreatest overexpression of HER-2 [15]. Growth inhibition of\nMDA-MB-468 cells, which express normal levels of HER-2,\nwas observed with a 10% inhibition using a dose of 5 \u03bcg\/ml\nand 20% using 170 \u03bcg\/ml. Thus, according to the MTT\nassay, clinically relevant doses of 50\u201360 \u03bcg\/ml would result\nin some growth inhibition of tumor cells that do not\noverexpress HER-2.\nAlthough the MTT assay is effective in demonstrating\nsensitivity of cells to a drug, it is a measure of mitochondrial\noxidative potential and utilized as a measure of cell number\nbut does not reveal whether or not those cells are fully\nfunctional in terms of long-term proliferative ability.\nFurthermore, some drug treatments influence mitochondrial\noxidative potential. The colony-forming assay, on the other\nhand, measures a drug's ability to induce clonogenic cell\ndeath [16,17]. With the use of this assay, continuous\nexposure to trastuzumab for 7 and 10 days was found to\nhave produced only a marginal decrease in colony formation\nafter treatment of MDA-MB-468 cells with the apparentIC20 determined using the MTT assay, suggesting that\ntreatment with trastuzumab would not be therapeutically\neffective as expected for HER-2-negative cells. Continuous\nexposure of SKBr3 and MDA-MB-453 cells to trastuzumab\nappreciably decreased their proliferative capacity, concur-\nring with the MTT results and demonstrating the effective-\nness of trastuzumab therapy for HER-2-overexpressing\ntumor cells.\nIn terms of HER-2 expression, MDA-MB-453 cells are\nconsidered to be 2+ [18], which is the minimum expression\nby breast tumors for which trastuzumab is clinically utilized.\nCells that were sensitive to trastuzumab (SKBr3) exhibited\ndecreased FDG incorporation relative to untreated cells\nwhen treated with IC50 doses of trastuzumab for 4 and 6\ndays. However, MDA-MB-453 cells, which exhibit lower\nHER-2 expression and are less sensitive to trastuzumab,\nexhibited greater decreases in incorporation and at earlier\ntime points.\nThe response of SKBr3 cells to trastuzumab was\naccompanied at 2 days by increased FDG incorporation\nbefore declining to below control levels. This may reflect an\nearly stimulatory effect of trastuzumab on SKBr3 cells.\nMetabolic flare is more commonly associated with tamox-\nifen treatment [19]; however, two studies [20,21] have\nreported that exposure of tumor cells, including SKBr3\ncells, to trastuzumab results in an initial stimulatory\nphosphorylation of HER-2. Cell death has also been shown\nto be associated with an early increase in FDG incorpora-\ntion. Thus, Aide et al. [22] recently showed that FDG\nincorporation increased 2 days after treatment of testicular\ntumor xenografts with cisplatin before decreasing at longer\ntime points, which was attributed to events associated with\ncell death.\nChanges in FDG incorporation have been documented\nin xenografts and in patients responding to the tyrosine\nkinase inhibitors CI-1033 [23] and lapatinib [24], respec-\ntively, which inhibit the epidermal growth factor receptor\ntyrosine kinases ErbB1 and ErbB2 downstream from HER-1\nand HER-2. In a study of eight patients with various solid\ntumors, one patient who had trastuzumab-resistant Her-2 3+\ntumor exhibiting a partial response showed the greatest\ndecrease in FDG incorporation 1 month after the start of\ntreatment [24].\nThe present study found that decreases at 6 days (and at\n4 h of treatment with MDA-MB-453 cells) in FDG\nincorporation corresponded with decreased HK activity.\nHK expression is increased by activation of the EGFR\/ErbB\npathway [25], so inhibition would be expected to decrease\nincorporation as observed in the present study. These\nfindings also suggest that HK activity in these breast tumor\ncell lines may be rate-limiting for FDG incorporation,\nconcurring with studies on breast cancer patients [26].\nFDG incorporation measures the rate of glucose utiliza-\ntion via glycolysis. The product of glycolysis, pyruvate, can\neither be converted to acetyl-CoA and enter the tricarboxylic\nacid cycle or be converted to lactic acid. Lactate levels in\n345R.W. Cheyne et al. \/ Nuclear Medicine and Biology 38 (2011) 339\u2013346tumors can be monitored using 1H NMR imaging, and\nstudies have shown using this technique that response to\ntherapy can be accompanied by decreased levels of lactic\nacid [27]. Thus, Lee et al. [27] showed that response to\ntreatment of xenografts derived from WSU-DLCL2 non-\nHodgkin's lymphoma cells with a combination of rituximab,\ncyclophosphamide, hydroxydoxorubicin, vincristine and\nprednisone exhibited decreased lactate levels. On the other\nhand, the use of hyperpolarized 13C-labeled pyruvate\nutilization [28] has shown decreased flux of the hyperpolar-\nized 13C label between pyruvate and lactate, corresponding\nwith decreased FDG uptake by murine lymphoma cells after\ntreatment for 24 h with the topoisomerase II inhibitor,\netoposide. In the present study, both SKBr3 and MDA-MB-\n453 cells exhibited significant decreases in lactate produc-\ntion after treatment with trastuzumab for 6 days, suggesting\nthat following lactate production, pre- and post-treatment\nmay be useful in predicting response to anti-HER-2\nantibody treatment.\nHigh doses of trastuzumab were found to induce a\nmoderate growth-inhibitory effect on MDA-MB-468 cells\nand to significantly decrease FDG incorporation by this cell\nline, although only by about 10% and at later time points.\nThis could be attributed to an interruption of the pairing\neffect of HER-2 with other HER receptors by trastuzumab\n[29,30].\nIn conclusion, changes in FDG incorporation at the cell\nlevel by breast tumor cells correspond with response to IC50\ndoses of the anti-HER-2 antibody trastuzumab. The\nsensitivity of HK to this drug underlies the reduction in\nFDG incorporation. Decreased lactate production may be a\nuseful indicator of response to trastuzumab.Acknowledgments\nFunding by the Breast Cancer Campaign (Grant No.\n2006PhdNov02) is gratefully acknowledged.References\n[1] Meric-Bernstam F, Hung MC.
