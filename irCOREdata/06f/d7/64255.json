Both adsorption edge and isotherm experiments were conducted 14 \ncovering a wide range of soil composition, e.g. soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration 15 \nranging from 0.18% to 7.15%, and varying Cd concentrations and solution pH. The SOC 16 \nand solution pH were the most important parameters controlling Cd partition equilibrium 17 \nbetween soils and solutions in our experimental conditions. The Windermere humic 18 \naqueous model (WHAM) was used to calculate Cd adsorption on soils. The effect of 19 \nsolution chemistry (various pH and Cd concentrations) on Cd adsorption can be well 20 \naccounted for by WHAM. For different soil compositions, SOC concentration is the most 21 \nimportant parameter for Cd binding. Only a fraction of SOC, the so-called active organic 22 \ncarbon (AOC), is responsible for Cd binding. We found a linear relationship between 23 \nSOC and AOC based on the adsorption edge data. The linear relationship was validated 24 \nby the independent data sets: adsorption isotherm data, which presumably can be used to 25 \npredict Cd partition equilibrium across a wide range of soil compos itions. The modeling 26 \napproach presented in this study helps to quantitatively predict Cd behavior in the 27 \nenvironment. 28 \nKeywords: cadmium, adsorption, WHAM, active organic matter, partition, modeling 29 \n 3 \nIntroduction 30 \nAdsorption of Cd on soils is an important process controlling Cd behavior in the 31 \nenvironment. Soils consist of different components including soil organic matter (SOM), 32 \nmetal (hydro)oxides and clay minerals that are responsible for Cd binding. Different 33 \ncomponents in soils may contribute to Cd adsorption to different extents. Due to the 34 \nlimitations of experimental techniques (Zachara et al., 1992), it is very difficult to 35 \nexperimentally identify the contribution of individual adsorbents to the control of trace 36 \nmetal adsorption on soil particles. The partition coefficient Kp has been widely used to 37 \ncharacterize the equilibrium relationship  of trace metals between solution and solid 38 \nphases. Empirical relationships have been derived by relating Kp to key soil and solution 39 \nparameters (e.g. total metal concentration, SOM content, pH, etc.) through multiple 40 \nregression analysis (Janssen et al., 1997; Impellitteri et al., 2002; McBride et al., 1997; 41 \nSauv\u00e9 et al., 2000, 2003). For example, the distribution of trace metals between solid and 42 \nsolution phases could be calculated based on pH, total metal content and organic matter 43 \n(Sauv\u00e9 et al., 2000). 44 \nCompared with traditional statistical regression models, more recently mechanistic 45 \nmodels have been used to describe metal partitioning between soils and solutions (Weng 46 \net al., 2001; Gustafsson et al., 2003; Tipping et al., 2003; Lumsdon, 2004; Ponizovsky et 47 \nal., 2006), including the Windermere humic aqueous model (WHAM) (Tipping, 1994). 48 \nSOM has been reported to be the major component among soil components accounting 49 \nfor metal binding. Furthermore, it has been reported that only a fraction of SOM, which is 50 \ncalled active organic matter (AOM), is responsible for metal binding (Tipping et al., 2003; 51 \nGustafsson et al., 2003; Lumsdon, 2004). The AOM may be due to the difference 52 \n 4 \nbetween the SOM and the generic humic substance to which the equilibrium models are 53 \ncalibrated. SOM consists of non-humic substances such as amino acids, carbohydrates, 54 \nand lipids, as well as humic substance, a series of high-molecular-weight, brown to black 55 \nsubstances formed by secondary synthesis reactions (Stevenson, 1994). SOM may also 56 \ncoat on mineral phase and thus some inner part of SOM may be not accessible due to 57 \ncoating (Nachtegaal and Sparks, 2003). However, there are no well-established methods 58 \nto determine AOM. 59 \nInorganic components, such as clay minerals and metal oxides\/hydroxides, can also 60 \nbe important in controlling Cd reactions in soils (Kabata-Pendias, 2001). The role of 61 \ndifferent soil components for metal binding may be dependent on the experimental 62 \nconditions. For example, clay minerals are more important for metal adsorption at low 63 \npH, low soil organic matter content and high metal loading (Weng et al., 2004). 64 \nIn this paper, the Cd adsorption edge and adsorption isotherms data for 14 New 65 \nJersey soils were analyzed using WHAM VI (Tipping 1998), the latest version of 66 \nWHAM. In WHAM VI, a number of parameters have been recognized as being 67 \nimportant for predicting metal partitioning including organic matter, and iron and 68 \naluminum competition (Tipping, et al., 2003). In this study, we are seeking a unique set 69 \nof WHAM input parameters for Cd adsorption that are applicable for different soils at 70 \nvarious solution chemistry conditions. The competition effect of Al at different pH ranges 71 \nwas tested. 72 \nMaterials and Methods  73 \n 5 \nThe 14 New Jersey soils those were used to conduct adsorption experiments are 74 \ndescribed in Table 1. The sample of Delaware River fill material that was included in the 75 \noriginal study (Lee et al., 1996) has not been included in the present analysis as it is not a 76 \nsoil. All soils are non-calcareous soils with pH less than 7. These soils cover a variety of 77 \nsoil properties. The soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration ranging from 0.18% to 78 \n7.15%, which was measured with a Variomax CN analyzer. The ammonium oxalate 79 \nextractable soil metal (hydro)oxides were presented in Lee et al. (1996). The 80 \nexchangeable Ca and Mg were extracted with the 0.1 M BaCl2 for 24 h (Carter, 1993). 81 \nThe Al was extracted with the 0.43 M HNO3 for 24 h (Dijkstra et al., 2004). 82 \n1. Adsorption edge experiment 83 \nBatch equilibration studies were conducted with soil concentration = 1.00 \u00b1 0.01 g 84 \nper 100 mL solution and ionic strength = 0.01M with NaNO3. Cd nitrate concentrations = 85 \n1 \u00d7 10-5 and 1 \u00d7 10-4 M with pH = 3 to 9 and temperature = 25 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C. Samples were 86 \nshaken at 150 rpm for 24 hours and filtered through 25 mm diameter, 0.45 \u00b5m membrane 87 \nfilters. 88 \n2. Adsorption isotherm experiment 89 \nThe soil samples, 1.0 gram of each, were immersed in 100 mL of 0.01 M NaNO3. 90 \nThe pH was adjusted in order to approach the desired pHs, 4.0, 5.5, and 7.0 and 91 \ntemperature = 25 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C. The initial Cd concentrations ranged from 1.0 \u00d7 10-6 to 5 \u00d7 10-3 92 \nM, and the equilibration time was 24 hours. After 24 hours, the pH was readjusted to the 93 \ninitial value and the samples were filtered through 0.45 \u00b5m membrane filters. 94 \n 6 \nCadmium concentrations in the filtered solutions were determined by atomic 95 \nabsorption spectrometry as reported by Lee et al. (1996). The detailed information on 96 \nexperimental procedures can be found in Lee et al. (1996). 97 \nModeling Method 98 \nWHAM VI was used to calculate Cd adsorption equilibrium at different conditions. 99 \nWHAM is capable of calculating the  equilibrium chemical speciation in surface and 100 \nground waters, sediments, and soils, especially when the chemica l speciation is 101 \ndominated by organic matter (Tipping, 1994 ; Tipping et al., 2003). WHAM uses Model 102 \nVI, a computer model, to describe the reactions of ions with humic substances, mainly 103 \nthrough complexation which is modified by electrostatic reactions. Previous modeling 104 \nresults have demonstrated that, for most non-calcareous soils except for soils with very 105 \nlow SOM concentrations, the SOM is the major adsorbent for trace metals (Tipping et al., 106 \n2003; Ponizovsky et al., 2006). Preliminary WHAM calculations showed that metal 107 \noxides have little effect on Cd adsorption for most of our soils, so only SOM and clay 108 \nfraction were used in WHAM calculations. The WHAM input parameters include 109 \nparticulate humic acid (HA) and fulvic acid (FA) concentrations ([HA] and [FA] ), the 110 \nclay concentration, pH, the CO2 pressure (pCO2), and solution cations and anions 111 \nconcentrations or activities including [Na+], [Ca2+], {Al3+} or [Al3+], {Fe3+} and [NO3-]. 112 \nThe pCO2 was set at 10-3.5 atm. Ponizovsky et al. (2006) have demonstrated that the 113 \nvariation of pCO2 from 10-4 to 10-2 atm had little effect in their model calculations. The 114 \nMg concentrations were low which had little effect on Cd adsorption. For the solution 115 \nspecies, the concentrations were input as measured in the experiments. For the SOM, 116 \n 7 \nonly the active fraction, AOM, was used in WHAM VI calculations and the active 117 \nfraction was assumed to consist of 84% HA and 16% FA (Tipping et al., 2003). 118 \nDue to the high concentration of Cd in this study, preliminary model calculations 119 \nshowed that the competition of Fe3+ was minimal. The competition of Al on Cd 120 \nadsorption could be different at different pH. The Al activity in the soil solution can be 121 \nestimated by assuming that the solution was equilibrated with Al hydroxides (Tipping et 122 \nal., 2003), as described by equation 1. 123 \npH3log}Allog{ 0\n*3 -=+ sK  (1) 124 \nTipping (2005) has further assessed how Al3+ activity was dependent on pH and whether 125 \nAl3+ activity was controlled by Al hydroxides or not. At low pH, solubility control of Al 126 \nhydroxides may overestimate the Al3+ activity and a linear regression equation was 127 \nproposed as described by equation 2. 128 \n2.22pH59.1}Allog{ 3 +-=+  (2) 129 \nOther researchers used acid extraction to estimate the active Al accounting for Al 130 \ncompetition to metal binding (Dijkstra et al., 2004). 131 \nIn our modeling for the Al competition effect, we started with the acid extractable Al. 132 \nThe 0.43 M HNO3 extractable Al was input as the total Al concentration in the WHAM 133 \ncalculations for adsorption reactions. The model calculations showed that the Al3+ 134 \nactivity calculated by acid extractable Al was too high, as it exceeds the solubility control 135 \nof Al hydroxides. Then we used the regression equation (equation 2) to calculate Al3+ 136 \nactivity at low pH. At pH greater than 5, Al3+ activity controlled by Al(OH)3 solubility 137 \nwith a log*Ks0 value of 8.5 can consistently describe the Cd adsorption. However, at pH 138 \n<= 5, the regression equation provided too high Al3+ activity which resulted in much less 139 \n 8 \nCd adsorption on soils compared with the experimental values, as discussed later. So we 140 \ntried to estimate the active Al concentration by model fitting of experimental data at pH 141 \n<= 5, which controls the Al competition for each soil at pH <= 5. 142 \nFor all 14 soils, the adsorption edge data at two initial Cd concentrations were 143 \ntabulated in Microsoft EXCEL 2000. A version of WHAM VI that can be executed in 144 \nEXCEL with specific input parameters described previously was used to fit the 145 \nadsorption edge data. The errors of the percentage of adsorption between WHAM VI 146 \ncalculations and experimental results were calculated. Then the squares of the errors were 147 \nsummed and minimized using the EXCEL 2000 SOLVER program by optimization of 148 \nmodel parameters, active organic carbon (AOC) and active Al. The AOC and active Al 149 \nwere obtained separately. The AOC was converted to AOM by multiplying a factor of 1.8, 150 \nwhich was further calculated as HA and FA as described before. The data at pH > 5 was 151 \nused first to obtain the amount of AOC for each soil where the Al3+ activity was 152 \ncontrolled by the Al hydroxide. The amount of AOC was adjusted for each soil until the 153 \nsum of errors was minimized at pH > 5. Then the data at pH <= 5 was used to obtain the 154 \nactive Al which controls the Al competition at pH <= 5. The AOC was used as obtained 155 \nfrom model fitting at pH > 5. The total active Al concentration was adjusted until the sum 156 \nof errors was minimized at pH <= 5. The total active Al concentrations for all soils are 157 \nlow which precludes the formation of Al hydroxides. The parameters used for WHAM VI 158 \ncalculations are summarized in Table 2. 159 \nAfter obtaining the amount of AOC, we developed a linear relationship between the 160 \nAOC and SOC. The linear relationship was applied to predict the adsorption isotherms, 161 \nwhich were validated by the experimental data. 162 \n 9 \nResults and Discussion 163 \nThe Cd adsorption changes dramatically from low pH to high pH, less than 10% 164 \nadsorption at pH < 3, and more than 90% adsorption at pH > 8 for most soils. Generally, 165 \nWHAM VI is able to account for the variation of Cd partitioning as a function of solution 166 \npH and Cd concentrations for different soils, and the model fit is consistent with the  167 \nadsorption edge data. Figure 1 presents the results for three soils. The model curves show 168 \ndiscontinuities at pH 5 due to the different approaches for Al competition for pH below 169 \nor above 5. The model results support the assumption that SOM is the major sorbent for 170 \nCd for most of soils in our study. Lee et al. (1996) also reported that SOM plays the most 171 \nimportant role in controlling Cd adsorption. By analyzing literature data of more than 70 172 \nstudies, Sauv\u00e9 et al. (2000) developed a regression equation for Cd partitioning between 173 \nsoils and solutions based on pH, total Cd concentration and SOM concentration. Likewise, 174 \nthe partitioning of Cd between soils and solutions can be predicted by the NICA-Donnan 175 \nmodel when the organic matter was considered as the major sorbent controlling Cd 176 \nbinding (Benedetti et al., 1996; Lumsdon, 2004). Furthermore  by using the regression 177 \nequation for low pH by Tipping (2005), the model calculated less Cd adsorption. The 178 \nregression equation was obtained from data at 10 \u00b0C and the Al3+ activity could vary 179 \nmore than one order of magnitude for different soils (Tipping, 2005). 180 \nOverall, the amount of AOC for all 14 soils increases with the increase of SOC and 181 \nthe quantity of AOC is linearly related to SOC, with R2 = 0.827 (Figure 2). The linear 182 \nregression equation has a slope of 0.629 which results in about 63% AOC for all soils. 183 \nGustafsson et al. (2003) tried to optimize the fraction of AOM for different soils to model 184 \ntrace metals adsorption using their Stockholm humic model, but they did not find any 185 \n 10 \nclear relationship between the optimized values and SOM. Tipping et al. (2003) did not 186 \nfind a clear relationship between active humic substance and SOM in their study. In our 187 \nstudy, we focused on the mineral soils, which have much lower SOM than most of the 188 \norganic soils used by Tipping et al. (2003). The Cd concentrations used in this study are 189 \nalso higher. 190 \nDifferent methods have been applied to quantify the reactive organic matter in soils. 191 \nThe amount of AOC may vary depending on the methods used. Base extraction provides 192 \na direct way to estimate the humic substances in soils as used by some researchers 193 \n(Dijkstra et al., 2004; Lumsdon, 2004). Dijkstra et al. (2004) reported that the percentage 194 \nof the base extractable SOM ranged from 25% to 67% for a variety of soils. To obtain the 195 \nreactive organic matter, Tipping et al. (2003) adjusted the amount of active humic 196 \nsubstances of the soil so that the WHAM calculated pH was the same as the observed 197 \nvalue. Weng et al. (2001) used another approach to calculate the AOM in their NICA-198 \nDonnan model: adjusting the site density of SOM based on the cation exchange capacity 199 \nmeasurement of soils and the generic humic substance. Their results showed that the site 200 \ndensity of SOM varied between 46% and 16% of that of the generic humic substance, 201 \nwith the average value of AOM for all soils being 31%. Similarly Cances et al. (2003) 202 \nassumed that 50% organic carbon in soils was reactive in their modeling study. The linear 203 \nregression equation obtained in this study is based on parameter optimization, which 204 \nprovides a good approximation on reactive organic matter in soils for predicting Cd 205 \nadsorption on soils using WHAM VI. Whether this regression equation can be applied to 206 \nother trace metals needs to be further investigated. 207 \n 11 \nUsing the linear regression equation for AOC in Figure 2, WHAM VI was used to 208 \npredict both Cd adsorption edges and isotherms. The predictions for Cd adsorption edges 209 \nare self-calibrations for the linear regression equation since it is obtained from the 210 \nadsorption edge data (Figure 3). To further validate the linear regression equation for 211 \nAOC, WHAM VI predictions were compared with the independent data sets: Cd 212 \nadsorption isotherms. Figure 4 presents the WHAM VI predictions for the Cd adsorption 213 \nisotherms together with the experimental data at three different pHs for four typical soils. 214 \nThe model predict ions are consistent with the experimental results. The applicability of 215 \nAOC versus SOC linear relationship to independent data sets supports the validity of our 216 \nmodeling approach. 217 \nFigure 5 presents a detailed comparison between WHAM VI predicted partition 218 \ncoefficient Kp and experimental Kp in adsorption edge experiments. The results are 219 \npresented from low pH to high pH. At low pH (2 \u2013 4), WHAM VI over-predicted Kp. 220 \nWHAM predictions are close to experimental values at intermediate pH (4 \u2013 7). At high 221 \npH (7 \u2013 9), more scatter can be observed, indicating greater deviation between WHAM 222 \npredictions and experimental results. The deviations at high pH may be due to the 223 \ndissolution of SOM, which was not measured in the original experiment and thus not 224 \nconsidered in the modeling. Generally almost all deviations are within one order of 225 \nmagnitude. The root mean square error (RMSE) of log Kp equals 0.41. The comparison 226 \nbetween WHAM VI predicted Kp and experimental Kp in adsorption isotherm 227 \nexperiments are presented in Figure 6 for three pHs. The RMSEs were 0.33, 0.23 and 228 \n0.39 at pH 4.0, 5.5 and 7.0 respectively. 229 \n 12 \nThe Al competition varied at different pH ranges. It has been reported that, at low pH, 230 \nAl3+ activity may not be controlled by Al(OH)3 but by adsorption\/complexation reactions 231 \n(Tipping, 2005). Some researchers have used chemical extractions to quantify the active 232 \nAl (Gustafsson et al., 2003; Lumsdon, 2004). As pointed out by Gustafsson et al. (2003), 233 \nthe total active Al concentrations are not well quantified by available extraction 234 \nprocedures. Besides the extraction, different optimization methods have been used to 235 \nobtain the active Al. For example, Lumsdon (2004) used 0.1 M HCl extraction to 236 \nestimate the reactive Al and the fit of Cd adsorption curves was further improved by 237 \noptimizing the active Al. In our study, if the 0.43 M HNO3 extractable Al was used as the 238 \ntotal Al controlling Al competition for Cd adsorption, the model calculations resulted in 239 \nhigher Al3+ activity than that controlled by Al(OH)3. Therefore, we obtained the active Al 240 \nby optimizing the cadmium adsorption data at low pH. The Al3+ activity controlled by 241 \nthis active Al is lower than that controlled by Al(OH)3. This approach provides good 242 \nmodel predictions as demonstrated in Figures 5 and 6, together with the solubility control 243 \nof Al3+ at higher pH. Nevertheless accurate measurement of Al3+ activity and 244 \ncharacterization of Al phases controlling Al3+ activity are desired in order to more 245 \naccurately predict metal partitioning. 246 \nThe importance of mineral phases such as metal (hydro)oxides on Cd binding has 247 \nbeen reported by many studies (Tessier et al. 1985; Zachara, et al., 1992; Trivedi and Axe, 248 \n2000). In natural soils, with the competition of SOM for Cd binding, other sorbents 249 \nbesides SOM may be less important with the increase of SOM concentration. 250 \nFurthermore, the dominant importance of SOM observed in this study is based on 251 \nlaboratory adsorption experiments, which may be different from highly contaminated 252 \n 13 \nfield soils. The field contaminated soils may experience various contamination processes 253 \nand thus the metal speciation could differ significantly (Manceau et al., 1996; Roberts et 254 \nal., 2002). 255 \nConclusions 256 \nWHAM VI has been successfully applied to describe Cd adsorption on different soils 257 \nwith a wide range of soil compositions and different solution chemistry conditions. 258 \nWHAM VI is able to account for the effect of major solution and soil parameters that 259 \ncontrol the Cd adsorption on soils. For most of soils in this study, SOC appears to be the 260 \nmajor soil component controlling Cd adsorption. Only a fraction of SOC, called AOC, is 261 \nresponsible for Cd binding. The AOC concentration is linearly related to the SOC 262 \nconcentration. Al competition effect should be considered differently at different pH 263 \nranges. At low pH, the Al competition was controlled by an active fraction of soil Al 264 \nrather than the solubility of the Al hydroxides. With the model parameters presented in 265 \nthis study, we can predict Cd adsorption behavior in soils using WHAM VI when SOC is 266 \nthe dominant sorbent in soils. 267 \nAcknowledgements 268 \nThis research has been supported by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and 269 \nthe Center for the Study of Metals in the Environment (CSME), University of Delaware.270 \n 14 \nReferences 271 \nBenedetti, M.
