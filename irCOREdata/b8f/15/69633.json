INTRODUCTION\nVertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSEL) are a novel class of semiconductor lasers which are having great\nsuccess in many applications requiring high speed, precision and efficiency. VCSELs promise to revolutionize fibre\noptic communications by improving efficiency and increasing data speed. Nowadays VCSELs allow computer\nnetworks transmit reliably data at rates of up to and beyond 10Gb\/s. Other successful applications of VCSEL\nare in the realization of proximity sensors, encoders, laser range finders, laser printing, bar code scanning, optical\nstorage.\nAmong the many benefits of VCSEL compared to over edge-emitting diodes, VCSELs are cheaper to man-\nufacture in quantity, they are easier to test, and they are more efficient. Moreover, the VCSELs require less\nelectrical current to produce a given coherent energy output. VCSELs emit a narrow, more nearly circular beam\nthan traditional edge emitters; this makes it easier to get the energy from the device into an optical fiber. It is\nexpected that in the nearest future, VCSEL will be one of the most popular laser diodes for the majority of the\napplications.\nThe main feature in VCSEL design is the cylindrical symmetry of the active cavity: this allows one to\nfabricate two dimensional arrays of lasers and reduces dramatically the astigmatism of the beam. Unfortunately\nthe applicability of VCSEL is limited by the presence of different instabilities in the polarization dynamics.\nConsider for example a VCSEL emitting in the fundamental transverse mode; due to the circular design of the\nactive medium, no well defined directions for the polarization are expected. Nevertheless, there is experimental\nevidence that, for the majority of the cases, the VCSEL emission just above threshold is with a well defined\nlinear polarization.1 Increasing the pumping current, the direction of the polarization changes from the first\nmode to the orthogonal one.2 For intermediate pumping current, both linear polarized states are stable, and\nthe VCSEL is observed to perform spontaneous transitions between the two modes.3 For very high values of the\npumping current, both modes lose their stability4\u20136 and higher order transverse modes appear. We stress that\nall these features are intrinsic in the VCSEL due to the geometry of the device and that they have to be properly\nunderstood in order to move toward a generation of VCSELs that are more efficient and reliable.\nDifferent attempts to control the polarization emission have been done by breaking in a controlled way the\nsymmetry of the device, for example with non-symmetrical growth of the active medium, or using \u201clocal burn-\ning\u201d7 or \u201chot spot\u201d techniques.8 A different approach to the polarization control have been attempted using\noptical injection in a master-slave configuration9 or optical feedback.10\nFrom a theoretical point of view, a big effort has been made in order to understand how the presence of\nFurther author information: send correspondence to Stefano Beri: s.beri@lancaster.ac.uk or to Riccardo Mannella:\nmannella@df.unipi.it\nPublished in Fluctuations and Noise in Photonics and Quantum Optics II, eds.

In the\nbistability regime, the system presents two stable points corresponding to the two polarization modes whose\nbasins of attraction are separated by an unstable limit cycle. The presence of spontaneous emission allows the\nsystem to move away from the stable states and explore different states of polarization. When the noise intensity\nis small, the system spends the majority of the time in the vicinity of one of the stable states, but, occasionally,\nan exceptional noise burst can drive the system to the basin of attraction of the other polarization state and a\npolarization transition is observed.\nThe small fluctuations in the vicinity of the steady states have been carefully investigated in the linear regime.6, 13\u201315\nHowever, the investigation of the large fluctuations (involving a full nonlinear treatment) and, in particular, of\nthe polarization switches in the devices is far from being completed.\nA possible way to approach the problem comes from the study of activation problems in stochastic nonlinear sys-\ntems.16 The main result achieved is that, in the limit of zero noise intensity, the polarization switch is expected\nto take place in a ballistic manner along a most probable transition path (MPTP) that can be obtained from an\nauxiliary Hamiltonian system.17\u201324\nIn this paper we consider a VCSEL emitting in the fundamental transverse mode in the bistable polarization\nregime. The dynamics of the polarization is described using the polarization angles.6 Polarization switches are\ninvestigated in the regime of small noise intensity. The MPTP and the activation energy are found for different\nvalues of the pumping parameters.\n2. THEORY\n2.1 VCSEL emission\nIn this section we summarize the theory for the polarization dynamics of the VCSEL. The SFM model11 ap-\nproximates the band structure of the active medium as a two-level system. The upper level (conduction band)\nis populated by electrons having total angular momentum J = 1\n2\n\u2217 and projection in the axis direction Jz = \u00b1\n1\n2\n.\nThe lower level (heavy holes band) is populated by electrons having total angular momentum J = 3\n2\nand pro-\njected angular momentum Jz = \u00b1\n3\n2\n.\nIn the dipole approximation two independent electronic transitions are involved: + 3\n2\n\u2212\u2192 + 1\n2\n(and the inverse)\nand \u2212 3\n2\n\u2212\u2192 \u2212 1\n2\n(and its inverse). Due to the conservation of angular momentum, two separate classes of circular\npolarized photons are involved in the two transitions. The two families of electrons are coupled by a large num-\nber of different relaxation processes,11 for example interaction with static scatterers25 or electron-hole exchange\ninteraction.26 All these processes are summarized in the SFM model introducing a phenomenological spin-flip\nrate. The two families of photons are directly coupled by the presence of amplitude and phase anisotropies in\nthe cavity or in the mirrors.4 Including all these effects, the following rate equations11 for the emission of the\nVCSEL are obtained\nE\u02d9\u00b1 = \u2212 (\u03b3l + i\u03c9l)E\u2213 + k (1\u2212 i\u03b1) (D \u00b1 d\u2212 1)E\u00b1\nD\u02d9 = \u2212\u03b3||D + \u03b3|| (\u039b + 1)\u2212 \u03b3||\n[(\n|E+|\n2 + |E\u2212|\n2\n)\nD \u2212\n(\n|E+|\n2 \u2212 |E\u2212|\n2\n)\nd\n]\nd\u02d9 = \u2212\u03b3Jd\u2212\n[(\n|E+|\n2 \u2212 |E\u2212|\n2\n)\nD \u2212\n(\n|E+|\n2 + |E\u2212|\n2\n)\nd\n] . (1)\nHere E\u00b1 represent the slowly-varying components of the clockwise and anti-clockwise electric fields; D is the\naverage insertion population of the two families of electrons and d indicates half the difference in the inversion\npopulation. Different parameters are present in the model, describing the effect of anisotropies and dissipation\nprocesses in the active media (and in the mirrors): \u03b3l and \u03c9l are the absorptive and dispersive linear anisotropies;\n\u2217All angular momenta are given in units of h\u00af\n\u03b3|| is the decay rate of the inversion population and \u03b3J is the spin-flip rate measuring how often electrons\nspontaneously move from one family to the other. \u039b is the dimensionless pumping factor normalized at the\nthreshold, \u03b1 is the linewidth enhancement factor and \u03ba is the average lifetime of a photon in the cavity. The\ndimensionless parameter \u0393 = \u03b3J\n\u03b3||\nmeasures the relative importance of the spin-flip and the relaxation. A small\nvalue of \u0393 indicates that the electrons behave mainly as two separate families and the coupling between the two\npolarization mode take place mainly through anisotropies. On the other hand, a large value of \u0393 indicates that\nthe electrons behave as a single reservoir for the two circular polarized modes and the two modes are strongly\ncoupled even with very small anisotropies. It is an experimental result that typical values of \u0393 for a standard\nVCSEL exceed 100.\nThe stationary polarization modes of the VCSEL can be obtained from (1) introducing a trial-solution of the\nform\nE+ = \u00b1E\u2212 = A exp [\u2212i\u03c9t] (2)\nD = D0 (3)\nd = 0. (4)\nThe mode with E+ = \u00b1E\u2212 corresponds to x\u02c6-polarized light, while E+ = \u2212\u00b1E\u2212 correspond to y\u02c6-polarized light.\nSubstituting (2-4) in (1), the following relations are obtained\nA =\n\u221a\n1\n2\n\u039b \u2213 \u03b3l\n\u03ba\n1\u00b1 \u03b3l\n\u03ba\n(5)\nD0 = 1\u00b1\n\u03b3l\n\u03ba\n(6)\n\u03c9 = \u00b1\u03c9l \u00b1 \u03b1\u03b3l (7)\nIt is clear that the two linearly polarized modes have slightly different frequencies; therefore, intensities and\ngains differ slightly in the two modes. In particular, it is possible that for small pumping currents, only one of\nthe modes is steadily lasing. In what follows, we consider the pumping to be big enough to allow lasing in both\nmodes.\nOutside the linear regime, the set of equations (1) is very complicated and it requires further simplification in\norder to achieve an understanding of the polarization dynamics. It is a well known result that the polarization of\nthe radiation can be described as a flow on the unitary sphere in the space of the normalized Stokes component\nsi where \uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\ns1 = cos(2\u03c7) cos(2\u03c6) = 2\n\u211c[E\u2217+E\u2212]\nI\ns2 = cos(2\u03c7) sin(2\u03c6) = 2\n\u2111[E\u2217+E\u2212]\nI\ns3 = sin(2\u03c7) =\n|E+|\n2\u2212|E\u2212|\n2\nI\nI = |E+|\n2 + |E\u2212|\n2\n(8)\nHere I represents the intensity of the radiation, and the two angles \u03c7 and \u03c6 represent the ellipticity and the\ndirection of the polarization respectively. The two linearly polarized stable solutions of (1) corresponds to\ns1 = \u00b11, s2 = s3 = 0. The differential equations satisfied by the angles \u03c7 and \u03c6 can be obtained by substitution\nof (8) into the rate equations (1). As a result, the following system is obtained\n\u03c7\u02d9 = \u03c9l sin(2\u03c6)\u2212 2\u03ba\u03b3d sin(2\u03c7) cos(2\u03c7) + \u03b3l sin(2\u03c7) cos(2\u03c6).

(Left) The topology of the space of the angles. The sides of the square have to be identified according to the\narrows. In particular, \u03c6 = 0 and \u03c6 = pi are identified as a cylinder, whilst \u03c7 = \u2212pi\/4 and \u03c7 = pi\/4 are identified as\na Moebius Stripe. The result of this is a Klein Bottle. The states with \u03c7 = 0 are the linearly polarized states. The\npolarization angle \u03c6 defines the the direction of the linear polarization.The circles indicate the stationary solution of\nEq.(15) and (16). (Right) The \u201cEscape Energy\u201d for the escape problem as a function of the parameter \u03b8. The global\nminimum of the action corresponds to the MPTP.\nThe dynamics of the polarization couples with the dynamics of the intensity and the internal dynamics of\nthe medium through the average difference in the inversion population. Introducing some approximations, the\ndynamics of the angles can be fully decoupled from the other dynamical variables. In the limit of large values of\n\u0393, the dynamics of d can be adiabaticaally eliminated to give\nd = \u2212\nI\n\u0393\ns3 = \u2212\nI\n\u0393\nsin(2\u03c7). (14)\nMoreover, for small values of pumping and dichroism, the intensity of the radiation can be considered to be\nconstant. Introducing these approximations, the final result for the dynamics of the angles \u03c7 and \u03c6 is obtained:\n\u03c7\u02d9 = f\u03c7 (\u03c7, \u03c6) = \u03c9l sin(2\u03c6)\u2212\n2\u03ba\u039b\n\u0393\nsin(2\u03c7) cos(2\u03c7) + \u03b3l sin(2\u03c7) cos(2\u03c6); (15)\n\u03c6\u02d9 = f\u03c6 (\u03c7, \u03c6) = \u2212\u03c9l\nsin(2\u03c7)\ncos(2\u03c7)\ncos(2\u03c6) + \u03b3l\nsin(2\u03c6)\ncos(2\u03c7)\n\u2212\n2\u03b1\u03ba\u039b\n\u0393\nsin(2\u03c7). (16)\nwhere the effects of radiation intensity are included in the so-called non-linear anisotropies: \u03b3n = 2\n\u03ba\u039b\n\u0393\nand\n\u03c9n = \u03b1\u03b3n. They are the nonlinear absorptive anisotrpy and nonlinear dispersive anisotropy. It is clear that they\ndepend explicitly on the pumping parameter \u039b i.e. on the number of photons present in the active medium.\nEq. (15) and (16) completely describe the dynamics of the polarization of the VCSEL emission. Their solution\nis a smooth flow on the angle space \u2212\u03c0\/4 < \u03c7 < \u03c0\/4 and 0 < \u03c6 < \u03c0 which is diffeomorph to a Klein Bottle as\nshown in figure 1. The flows admit two stationary points \u03c7 = 0;\u03c6 = \u03c0\/2 and \u03c7 = 0;\u03c6 = 0 \u2261 \u03c0 corresponding\nto y\u02c6-polarized and x\u02c6-polarized linear modes. The stability of the two modes is obtained by linearisation of\nEq.(15) and (16) about the stable points.6 The stability of the modes depends on the interplay of linear and\nnonlinear anisotropies; for a device with small enough dicrohism, both modes are stable even for small values of\nthe pumping parameter \u039b. In this bistability regime, the basins of attractions of the two modes are separated\nby a saddle cycle. The shape of the cycle is determined by the interplay of all the anisotropies in the system.\n2.2 The fluctuations: solution of the boundary value problem\nThe system of equations (15) and (16) is purely deterministic. In order to describe a real device satisfactorily,\nthe spontaneous emission has to be taken into account. In this talk, we describe the spontaneous emission of\nphotons in the laser cavity phenomenologically: two stochastic terms \u03be\u03c7 and \u03be\u03c6 are introduced in Eq.(15) and\n(16). The full system describing the polarization dynamics including noise is\n\u03c7\u02d9 = f\u03c7(\u03c7, \u03c6) + \u03be\u03c7(t) (17)\n\u03c6\u02d9 = f\u03c6(\u03c7, \u03c6) + \u03be\u03c6(t) (18)\n\u3008\u03be\u03c7(t)\u3009 = \u3008\u03be\u03c6(t)\u3009 = 0 \u2200t (19)\n\u3008\u03be\u03c7(t)\u03be\u03c7(s)\u3009 = \u3008\u03be\u03c6(t)\u03be\u03c6(s)\u3009 = \u01eb\u03b4(t\u2212 s) \u3008\u03be\u03c6(t)\u03be\u03c7(s)\u3009 = 0 \u2200t, s (20)\nhere f\u03c7(\u03c7, \u03c6) and f\u03c6(\u03c7, \u03c6) are the drift field introduced in Eq.(15) and (16); \u03be\u03c7(t) and \u03be\u03c6(t) are two uncorrelated\nGaussian processes with intensity \u01eb describing the spontaneous emission in the system. Due to the presence of\nthe noise, the system has a certain non-zero probability of exploring regions of the angle-space (i.e. polarization\nstates) different than the stable ones.

It is well known27, 32\u201334 that there are many solutions of (24-27) that emanate from\nthe initial state and reach the limit cycle, each of them with a different value of S. According to (22), when\n\u01eb\u2192 0, only the trajectory with the least S contributes to the transition; all other trajectories are exponentially\ndisadvantaged. The trajectory that minimizes S is the MPTP.\nIt is well known22, 35 that the MPTP is an heteroclinic trajectory leaving the initial steady polarization state\nfor t \u2192 \u2212\u221e and reaching the saddle cycle asymptotically for t \u2192 \u221e. From the topological point of view, the\ntrajectories emanating from the initial state t \u2192 \u2212\u221e form its unstable Lagrangian manifold Mu; in the same\nway, the trajectories converging to the saddle cycle for t\u2192\u221e form its stable manifold M s. The MPTP lies on\nthe intersections of the two manifolds.\nThe key step to find the MPTP among all other trajectories emanating from the initial state is a proper\ncharacterization of the Lagrangian manifold in the vicinity of the initial state. In a small neighborhood of the\ninitial state, the unstable manifold is a plane in the phase space. The equations describing the shape of Mu can\nbe obtained by linearisation of the Hamiltonian equations (24-27) around the stationary point\nd\ndt\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\u03b4\u03c7\n\u03b4\u03c6\np\u03c7\np\u03c6\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\u2202f\u03c7\n\u2202\u03c7\n\u2202f\u03c7\n\u2202\u03c6\n1 0\n\u2202f\u03c6\n\u2202\u03c7\n\u2202f\u03c6\n\u2202\u03c6\n0 1\n0 0 \u2212\n\u2202f\u03c7\n\u2202\u03c7\n\u2212\n\u2202f\u03c6\n\u2202\u03c7\n0 0 \u2212\n\u2202f\u03c7\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2212\n\u2202f\u03c6\n\u2202\u03c6\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\u03b4\u03c7\n\u03b4\u03c6\np\u03c7\np\u03c6\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 . (29)\nwhere \u03b4\u03c7 and \u03b4\u03c6 represent the displacements from the stationary states and the partial derivatives are evaluated\nin the steady states. The unstable manifold is spanned by the two expanding eigenvalues ~vu1 and ~v\nu\n2 of the\nsystem. A generic point on Mu can be written as ~v = \u03b11~v\nu\n1 + \u03b12~v\nu\n2 where \u03b11,2 are complex coefficients.\nSeparating the angles and the momenta, the following relations are obtained(\n\u03b4\u03c7\n\u03b4\u03c6\n)\n=\n(\nv1\u03c7 v2\u03c7\nv1\u03c6 v2\u03c6\n)(\n\u03b11\n\u03b12\n)\n(\np\u03c7\np\u03c7\n)\n=\n(\nv1p\u03c7 v2p\u03c7\nv1p\u03c6 v2p\u03c6\n)(\n\u03b11\n\u03b12\n)\nUsing standard linear algebra techniques, the linear relation between x and p is obtained in the form p = Mx\nwhere the matrix M is defined as\nM =\n(\nv1p\u03c7 v2p\u03c7\nv1p\u03c6 v2p\u03c6\n)(\nv1\u03c7 v2\u03c7\nv1\u03c6 v2\u03c6\n)\u22121\n. (30)\nBecause the relationship between coordinates and momenta is known (the matrix M in Eq.(30)), it is enough to\nprovide a characterization of the trajectories in the coordinate space.\nFor a two-dimensional continuous system such as (15-16), the trajectories emanating from the initial stable point\nare a one-parameter family on the phase space. A possible choice for the parameterisation in the vicinity of a\nstable point can be the following: consider a small circle of given radius r around the stable point (r should be\nsmall enough for the application of Eq.(30)). The initial conditions for the trajectories are taken on this circle\nand the corresponding initial momenta are calculated using (30). In this way the unstable manifold is completely\nparameterised. From the topological point of view, the parameters space is diffeomorph to a circle S1.\nThe activation energy can now be calculated as a function of the initial conditions (i. e. of the parameter \u03b8)\nS : S1 \u2212\u2192 R.\nAccording to the discussion above, the minimum of the function S in the parameter space corresponds to the\ninitial conditions defining the MPTP.\n3. POLARIZATION TRANSITIONS\nThe activation energy as a function of the parameters can be plotted as an action plot, as in figure 1(right). The\nmain feature of the graph is the presence of many discontinuities corresponding to local minima. The presence\nof degenerate minima are a consequence of the central symmetry in the set (24-27): for every possible value of\nthe noise intensity, the polarization transition occurs with the same probability along two centrally symmetrical\npaths. The absolute minimum of the action corresponds to the MPTP.\nIn order to show the agreement of the theory, in figure 2 (left) the MPTP calculated using the minimisation\ntechnique is plotted together with a numerical solution of (17-18). Close agreement between them is evident. It\nshould be noted that, in the vicinity of the saddle cycle, the numerical trajectory diverges from the theory due\nto finite noise diffusion. This effect can be included in the theory expanding the Fokker-Planck equation (21) at\nthe next-to-the-leading order in order to include finite noise contributions.36\nWe now consider a typical VCSEL, and we vary the pumping current. According to the equations (15-16), this\ninduces a change in the nonlinear anisotropies, while the linear anisotropies are left unchanged. We consider a\nstandard device having birefringence \u03c9l as its dominant anisotropy and we calculate the activation energy for\ndifferent values of \u03b3n (i.e. different values of the pumping rate \u039b). The activation energy is plotted for different\n\u221220 \u221215 \u221210 \u22125 0\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n time\n \u03c6\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n \u03b3\nn\n S\nFigure 2. (Left) Comparison between theoretical MPTP and a realization of the transition calculated via numerical\nsimulation. The agreement between the two paths is excellent. The divergence of the experiment from the theory is due\nto finite noise diffusion.(Right) The dependence of the activation energy on the nonlinear dichrohism. The maximum\nof the activation energy corresponds to an exponentially stable polarization. The crosses are the results of numerical\nsimulations. For small values of \u03b3n there is an almost linear dependence of S on the pumping parameter.\nvalues of \u03b3n in figure 2 (right). The main feature of the activation energy is its non-monotony: for small above\nthreshold values of \u03b3n, the stability of the mode increases with pumping; but for higher pumping rates, the\ndependence inverts and the injection of more current into the system reduces the polarization stability.\nThe dashed line in figure 2 (right) represents the regime where the dynamics of the two fast-rotating Stokes\ncomponents s2 and s3 can be averaged out reducing the system to a double-well potential. The actual activation\nenergy is then smaller than that calculated using the simplified double-well model. From the physical point of\nview, the behavior of the activation energy can be justified as follow. When the system is close to the threshold\nand the nonlinear anisotropies can be neglected, an increase in the pumping current means an increase of the\nphotons in the lasing mode according to Eq.(5) To induce a polarization switch in this regime, a fluctuation\nshould suddenly damp the photons in one mode and at the same time produce photons in the other. It is clear\nthat such an event is disadvantaged by the presence of many photons in the lasing mode. On the other hand,\nwhen the pumping current is big enough, it starts affecting the stability of the lasing mode. In this regime\nan increase of the pumping reduce the stability of the modes and the fluctuation are strongly amplified. As a\nconsequence, the activation energy is reduced by an increase in the pumping because the stability of the mode\ndecreases. This particular shape of the activation energy suggests that the driving current can be used to control\nthe stability of the polarization modes and eventually favorite the stability of one of the modes on the others.\n4. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\nIn this talk, we investigated the full nonlinear polarization dynamics of a VCSEL emitting in the fundamental\ntransverse mode. The system of Maxwell-Bloch equations for the laser emission is reduced to a two-dimensional\nsystem describing the polarization state of the device. The presence of spontaneous emission in the system has\nbeen treated introducing stochastic terms into the polarization dynamics. In the limit of small noise intensity,\nthe stochastic dynamics of the polarization has been mapped to a four-dimensional Hamiltonian problem, and\nthe calculation of the activation energy for a polarization switch has been obtained by minimisation of the\ncost function along Hamiltonian trajectories. In order to perform the minimisation properly, the unstable\nLagrangian manifold of the steady polarization modes has been calculated using linear expansion, and the family\nof Hamiltonian trajectories has been conveniently parameterised with one parameter \u03b8. Taking the minimum of\nthe energy as a function of \u03b8, the most probable transition path has been located. It is in a good agreement with\nthe results of simulations for different values of the system\u2019s parameters.\nThe activation energy dependence on the nonlinear dichroism (i.e. pumping parameter) has been shown to\nbe nonmonotonic. In particular, the presence of a maximum in the activation energy suggests that the linear\npolarized modes can be made exponentially more stable choosing a proper value of the external pumping.\nREFERENCES\n1.
