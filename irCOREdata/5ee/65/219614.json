G. Pearson, In the Name of Oil : Anglo-American Relations in the Middle East,\n1950\u20131958 (Brighton : Sussex Academic Press, 2010, \u00a355.00\/$74.95). Pp. xi+263.\nISBN 978 1 84519 388 1.\nBritish and American policies in the Middle East in the decades following the\nSecond World War have drawn considerable scholarly interest in recent years.\nNo doubt one explanation is the attempt to set the Anglo-American interventions in\nthe Gulf of 1991 and 2003 in context. But the discord witnessed over the collapse\nof the Palestine mandate in 1948, the Iranian oil crisis of 1950\u201351, the Suez crisis of\n1956 and the October 1973 Arab\u2013Israeli war has also provided fertile ground for\nscholars seeking to sustain a functionalist critique of the mythology surrounding the\nAnglo-American \u2018\u2018 special relationship. \u2019\u2019\nIvan Pearson\u2019s book surveying the course of Anglo-American relations in the\nMiddle East during the pivotal decade of the 1950s is a further welcome addition to\nthe literature in the field. Pearson focusses on a series of test cases ranging from\nthe Iranian oil crisis, through Suez to the Jordanian and Syrian crises of 1957 and the\nAmerican and British interventions in Lebanon and Jordan in 1958. The essence of\nhis argument is to play down the significance of the Suez crisis itself as a watershed\nin Anglo-American relations in the region. British policy in the region did not be-\ncome subservient to that of the United States in the wake of Suez. Rather,\nthe Macmillan government continued to pursue its own interests and strategy after\nthe crisis, but attempted to coopt the Eisenhower administration in its approach.\nThere was thus a tactical change in London\u2019s handling of Anglo-American relations\nin the Middle East but no immediate fundamental strategic reappraisal.\nThis argument will come as no surprise to specialists working in the field. While\nPearson\u2019s book is strong in its use of primary sources drawn from both British and\nAmerican archives, his treatment of the historiography is considerably weaker.\nRepeatedly he refers to \u2018\u2018 traditional historiographies \u2019\u2019 which maintain that Suez was\na defining watershed in Anglo-American relations, arguing that he is in effect the\nfirst to challenge an established orthodoxy. It is true that a number of the key works\non Suez originally published at the beginning of the 1990s, including Scott Lucas\u2019s\nDivided We Stand and Keith Kyle\u2019s Suez, do emphasize the centrality of Suez as a\nwatershed in Anglo-American relations. However, Suez revisionism is more than\ntwo decades old. As long ago as 1988 both John Darwin in his Britain and\nDecolonisation and Anthony Adamthwaite in an article titled \u2018\u2018Suez Revisited \u2019\u2019 in\nInternational Affairs argued that the crisis had to be set in context and that its impact\nwas subtle and diffuse rather than immediate and clear-cut. Thereafter, almost all of\nthe work published on Anglo-American relations in the region from the mid-1990s\nthrough the 2000s attempted one way or another to set the crisis in context. Missing\nfrom Pearson\u2019s bibliography are works published during this period by Richie\nOvendale (Britain, the United States and the Transfer of Power in the Middle East), Salim\nYaqub (Containing Arab Nationalism), Robert McNamara (Britain, Nasser and the\nBalance of Power in the Middle East) and all of Stephen Blackwell\u2019s research.\nHis lack of attention to the historiography leads Pearson considerably to overstate\nthe novelty of his own work. This approach reaches its apotheosis in his claim that\nJournal of American Studies f Cambridge University Press 2011\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 03 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\n\u2018\u2018 the well-worn discourse of Suez as a precipitous turning point_ has led research\naway from more detailed examinations of Britain\u2019s role in the Middle East in the\npost-1956 era \u2019\u2019 (178). This claim is simply not true. Apart from the works cited\nabove, there has also been considerable research on Britain\u2019s changing role in the\nGulf after Suez by other historians including Simon Smith and Spencer Mawby.\nWhile Pearson does make a useful contribution to the literature in this field, it is\none of reinforcing and refining existing trends in Suez revisionism rather than of\noverturning an unchallenged, established orthodoxy.\nN IGEL A SHTONLondon School of Economics and Political Science\nReviews 2\n"}
