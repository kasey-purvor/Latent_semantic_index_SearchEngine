Stamper).\n2738 Stamper et al.\n1. Introduction\nThe association between angiogenesis and solid tumour growth has been investigated ex-\ntensively since the early 1970s (Folkman, 1971). Angiogenesis is characterised by sprout-\ning from pre-existing vessels via the migration and proliferation of endothelial cells (ECs)\nand it is now well known that tumours, often as a result of hypoxia, secrete tumour angio-\ngenic factors (TAFs) which stimulate angiogenesis (Mantzaris et al., 2004). More recently,\nvasculogenesis has been shown to contribute to the vasculature in solid tumours (Bolon-\ntrade et al., 2002; Duda et al., 2006; Li et al., 2004; Lyden et al., 2001; Peters et al., 2005;\nSpring et al., 2005). Originally vasculogenesis, or blood vessel formation de novo, was\nthought to occur only during embryogenesis when stem cells (angioblasts) differentiate\nfrom mesoderm, and aggregate, align and differentiate into ECs to form the first vas-\ncular networks (Drake, 2003; Risau and Flamme, 1995). Postnatal vasculogenesis was\nnot reported until 1997, when endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), found in the blood of\nadult individuals, were shown to induce postnatal vasculogenesis at ischemic sites (Asa-\nhara et al., 1997). During postnatal vasculogenesis, EPCs are recruited from the bone\nmarrow into the blood and incorporate into vascular structures at the site of neovascular-\nisation by proliferating and differentiating into ECs (see Fig. 1) (Hristov et al., 2003;\nHunting et al., 2005; Khakoo and Finkel, 2005; Rafii et al., 2002; Ribatti, 2004;\nTepper et al., 2005; Vajkoczy et al., 2003). One substance known to mobilise EPCs from\nthe bone marrow is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (Asahara et al., 1999;\nHattori et al., 2001). VEGF is closely correlated with tumour neovascularisation and is\nsecreted by tumour cells, for example during hypoxia (Harris, 2002). Since increased\nlevels of VEGF have been observed in the blood of patients with certain cancers\n(Hoeben et al., 2004; Kolomecki et al., 2001), it is possible that tumour-induced mo-\nbilisation of EPCs could occur. At present, there is no consensus on whether the level of\nEPCs in the blood of cancer patients is elevated (Dome et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2003;\nSussman et al., 2003).\nThe relative importance of vasculogenesis in postnatal conditions, for example tu-\nmour vascularisation, is also still heavily disputed. The fraction of vessels formed by\nvasculogenesis in experimental tumour models ranges from very high to nonexistent\n(Aghi and Chiocca, 2005). These discrepancies could be related to differences in the\ntumour strain, the tumour site or microenvironment or to the implementation and the\ntime scale of the experiments (Aghi and Chiocca, 2005). The discrepancies might also\nbe attributed to the difficulties in defining EPCs and distinguishing them from circu-\nlating ECs and from other circulating bone-marrow-derived cells (Hunting et al., 2005;\nKhakoo and Finkel, 2005). The data from human tumours are scarce. In one study of\nsix human tumour samples (obtained from patients who had received bone marrow trans-\nplants from donors of the opposite sex and later developed cancer), the contribution of\nEPCs varied from 1% to 12% (Peters et al., 2005).\nPreviously, only two mathematical models have been developed to investigate the\nimportance of vasculogenesis in solid tumour growth (Komarova and Mironov, 2005;\nStoll et al., 2003). In Stoll et al. (2003), tumour growth is assumed to depend on the total\nvascular density, i.e. both angiogenesis- and vasculogenesis-derived vessels. The vasculo-\ngenic contribution is determined by using a compartmental model of ordinary differential\nequations (ODEs) that predicts the level of EPCs and TAF in the blood and the bone\nmarrow. The ODE model is then coupled with partial differential equations (PDEs) that\nModelling the Role of Angiogenesis and Vasculogenesis 2739\nFig. 1 Illustration of tumour-induced vasculogenesis. EPCs are produced in the bone marrow. The tu-\nmour\u2019s secretion of angiogenic factors, which diffuse into the blood, may increase the production of EPCs\nin the bone marrow and mobilise EPCs into the bloodstream. EPCs travel through the bloodstream and\nhome in on the tumour vasculature, possibly influenced by high levels of angiogenic factors at the tumour\nsite. Subsequently, the EPCs progress into the tumour interstitium where they start to form clusters and\nalign themselves into new vessels.\ndescribe a radially-symmetric, expanding tumour mass. Using their model (Stoll et al.,\n2003), Stoll et al. were able to predict that EPCs can contribute appreciably to both the\nvascular density and the tumour growth rate. They also showed that combination treat-\nments which target both local and systemic parts of the vascularisation process are the\nmost effective at inhibiting tumour growth. In common with Stoll et al., Komarova and\nMironov (2005) also distinguish between three compartments (the bone marrow, the blood\nand the tumour). However, their model is simpler, being fully spatially-averaged and ne-\nglecting the concentrations of TAF. The predictions in Komarova and Mironov (2005) are\nthat for tumours which only acquire new vasculature by angiogenesis, the tumour mass\ngrows as a cubic power of time. If, however, only vasculogenesis is responsible for the\nneovasculature, tumours will grow faster than linearly initially, and linearly at large times.\nFurthermore, Komarova and Mironov predict that vasculogenesis will result in a decline\nin the level of EPCs in the bone marrow. In the blood, the number of EPCs will tend to\nzero at large times, possibly after having gone up initially.\nThe model we derive in this paper describes the development of a small solid tumour\nfrom an avascular state to an early stage of vascularisation. In order to keep the model as\n2740 Stamper et al.\nsimple as possible and amenable to analysis, we construct a compartmental ODE model,\nas was done in Komarova and Mironov (2005). However, while focusing on a minimal\nmodel, we still include some new features that were not considered in Komarova and\nMironov (2005) and Stoll et al. (2003). For example, we include TAF explicitly, indirectly\nlinking its production to hypoxia by assuming that its rate of production increases as the\nvascular density (and hence, the concentration of oxygen) decreases. While Stoll et al.\nincluded TAF explicitly, there the net angiogenic activity did not appear to be related\nto the microenvironment, e.g. hypoxia. Another new phenomenon that we incorporate is\nthe occlusion of newly formed vessels. Occlusion is believed to occur as a result of the\nincrease in mechanical pressure exerted on the immature vessels by rapidly proliferating\ntumour cells (Griffon-Etienne et al., 1999; Helmlinger et al., 1997; Padera et al., 2004).\nAs a result, we identify conditions under which the vascularised tumour evolves to a\nsteady state. This contrasts with the behaviour in Komarova and Mironov (2005) where\nvascularisation always leads to unconstrained tumour growth.\nThe remainder of this paper is organised as follows. We derive our model in Sec-\ntion 2 and devote Section 3 to analysis of two submodels, one where angiogenesis domi-\nnates vessel formation and one where vasculogenesis is dominant. In addition to allowing\nextraction of generic features of angiogenic and vasculogenic tumour growth, this ap-\nproach will enable comparisons with corresponding submodels in Komarova and Mironov\n(2005). In Section 4, we study the full model, investigating how the combined effects of\nangiogenesis and vasculogenesis affect tumour growth. We also show how our model\ncan be used to predict a tumour\u2019s response to chemotherapy and antiangiogenic ther-\napies. Finally, in Section 5, we discuss our results and compare them to experimental\ndata and predictions from existing mathematical models (Komarova and Mironov, 2005;\nStoll et al., 2003).\n2. Model development\nIn this section, we develop our model, which consists of a system of nonlinear time-\ndependent ODEs. The model has three compartments: the bone marrow, the blood and\nthe tumour, each of which are assumed to have a spatially uniform structure. We assume\nthat the tumour cells rely on a blood supply to survive and proliferate, and that the tumour\nvasculature can develop via angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. To describe vasculogene-\nsis, we introduce the dependent variables, x, y and z to denote the level of EPCs in the\nbone marrow, the blood and the tumour, respectively. Functional vessels created by EPCs\nthrough vasculogenesis are denoted by u, whereas vessels that arise from angiogenesis\nare denoted by w. Both u and w contribute to the total tumour vasculature volume, v,\nand hence to the growth rate of the tumour volume, m. We also allow for occlusion of the\nnewly formed vessels at a rate which increases with the ratio of tumour volume to vessel\nvolume. Furthermore, we assume that both vasculogenesis and angiogenesis are depen-\ndent on angiogenic factors and derive mass balance equations for the concentrations of\nTAF in the tumour, C1, in the blood, C2, and in the bone marrow, C3. A schematic di-\nagram showing how the dependent variables interact is presented in Fig. 2 while tables\nlisting the model variables and parameters are contained in the Appendix.\nModelling the Role of Angiogenesis and Vasculogenesis 2741\nFig. 2 Schematic diagram of our model showing how the dependent variables interact. The model has\nthree compartments: the tumour, the blood and the bone marrow. The tumour production of TAF stimu-\nlates neovascularisation by angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, whereas the expanding tumour mass inhibits\nvessel formation through occlusion. An increase in tumour vasculature, in turn, enhances tumour growth.\nThe model variables are: tumour volume, m; concentration of TAF in the tumour, C1, in the blood, C2,\nand in the bone marrow, C3; the level of EPCs in these compartments, x, y and z; and total vasculature,\nv, which consists of angiogenic vessel volume, w, and vasculogenic vessel volume, u. The parameter v0\nrepresents the volume of pre-existing vasculature.\n2.1. EPC dynamics\nSince vasculogenesis involves EPCs (as illustrated in Fig. 1), we model their dynamics as\nthey transit from the bone marrow to the blood and then to the tumour.\n2.1.1. EPC levels in the bone marrow, x(t)\nWe assume that the level of EPCs in the bone marrow, x(t), depends on their production\nand death (normal or due to apoptosis), as well as their delivery into the bloodstream.\nWhen no TAF is present, EPC production is assumed to occur at a constant rate, p1,\nwhereas apoptosis and delivery to the blood occur at rates d1x and k1x, respectively. In\nAsahara et al. (1999) and Moore et al. (2001), chemotaxis (in response to VEGF) is sug-\ngested to cause enhanced EPC mobilisation into the circulation; we describe this effect by\nincluding a term of the form k2(C2 \u2212 C3)x. This term models EPCs moving by chemo-\ntaxis toward regions of higher TAF concentration, across the wall of the blood vessels\ninto the bloodstream. Another factor that may play a role in EPC mobilisation is matrix\nmetalloprotease-9 (MMP-9). When MMP-9 is activated (e.g. in response to VEGF) it re-\nleases soluble Kit-ligand, which causes EPCs to move into the bone marrow vasculature\n(Heissig et al., 2002). Translocation into the vascular zone makes the EPCs more likely\nto enter the circulation, and transforms the cells from a quiescent to a proliferative state\n(Heissig et al., 2002). Accordingly, we assume that the production of EPCs increases in\n2742 Stamper et al.\nthe presence of TAF in the bone marrow and introduce an additional production term,\np2C3, to account for this. Combining the above factors, we arrive at the following equa-\ntion:\ndx\ndt\n= p1 + p2C3\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nproliferation\n\u2212k1x \u2212 k2(C2 \u2212 C3)x\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\ndelivery into blood\n\u2212 d1x\n\ufe38\ufe37\ufe37\ufe38\napoptosis\n, (1)\nwhere p1, p2, k1, k2 and d1 are positive constants.\n2.1.2. EPC levels in the blood, y(t)\nFor simplicity, we neglect EPC proliferation in the blood and assume that the level of\nEPCs in the bloodstream, y(t), increases due to delivery from the bone marrow (see Eq.\n(1)) and decreases at a rate d2y due to apoptosis and to EPC incorporation into other\ntissues. Circulating EPCs are, for instance, known to stick to vessel walls at active sites of\nneovascularisation, such as ischemic tissue (Tepper et al., 2005) and tumours (Vajkoczy\net al., 2003). The factors that govern adherence to the vasculature are not completely\nunderstood. In Vajkoczy et al. (2003), the adhesion of EPCs was shown to be dependent\non E- and P-selectin and glycoprotein ligand-1. Other factors that have been implicated\nin the homing of EPCs into the tumour vasculature are the integrin \u03b14\u03b21 (Jin et al., 2006),\nas well as the local level of VEGF at the tumour site and the activation of its receptor\nVEGFR-1 (Li et al., 2006). In accordance with the notion that VEGF upregulates EPC\nadherence, we assume that it occurs at a rate k3C1vy. Thus we have:\ndy\ndt\n= k1x + k2(C2 \u2212 C3)x\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\ndelivery from bone marrow\n\u2212 k3C1vy\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nadherence to tumour\n\u2212 d2y\n\ufe38\ufe37\ufe37\ufe38\napoptosis\/uptake by other organs\n, (2)\nwhere k3 and d2 are positive constants and v denotes the tumour vasculature.\n2.1.3. EPC levels in the tumour, z(t)\nIn both ischemic tissue (Tepper et al., 2005) and tumours (Vajkoczy et al., 2003), EPC\nincorporation into vessels follows a similar pattern. After adhering to the vascular wall, the\nEPCs egress into the interstitium where they start to form cellular clusters and gradually\nalign themselves into functional vessels. We therefore assume that the level of EPCs in the\ntumour, z(t), increases at a rate k3C1vy due to EPC adherence to the tumour vasculature\n(see Eq. (2)). We also incorporate EPC proliferation, which was observed in Tepper et\nal. (2005) (when the EPC formed clusters) and is enhanced when TAF levels are high\n(Asahara et al., 1999), by assuming that it occurs at a rate p3C1z. We assume further that\nthe level of EPCs in the tumour decreases at rate k4z when EPCs align to form functional\nvessels and at rate d3z due to apoptosis. Combining these ideas, we deduce that z(t)\nsatisfies:\ndz\ndt\n= k3C1vy\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nadherence from blood\n+ p3C1z\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nproliferation\n\u2212 k4z\n\ufe38\ufe37\ufe37\ufe38\nalignment into vessels\n\u2212 d3z\n\ufe38\ufe37\ufe37\ufe38\napoptosis\n, (3)\nwhere p3, k4 and d3 are positive constants.\nModelling the Role of Angiogenesis and Vasculogenesis 2743\n2.2. Tumour vasculature, v(t)\nThe total tumour vasculature, v(t), comprises the vasculogenic vasculature, u(t), the an-\ngiogenic vasculature, w(t), and a pre-existing constant background vasculature, v0, so\nthat\nv = w + u + v0. (4)\nWe include a constant background vasculature in (4) since the initiation of both angiogen-\nesis and vasculogenesis requires vessels to be present in the vicinity of the tumour.\n2.2.1. Vessels created by angiogenesis, w(t)\nEven though angiogenesis is a complex process, the main mechanism involves the\nsprouting of new capillaries from pre-existing vessels and can be summarised by three\nphases (Mantzaris et al., 2004): activation of ECs by TAF (such as VEGF and basic\nfibroblast growth factor (bFGF)), migration and proliferation of ECs, and vessel mat-\nuration. During activation, the ECs respond to the tumour\u2019s secretion of TAF, which,\nwhen bound to receptors on the surface of ECs, causes them to secrete enzymes, e.g.\nmetalloproteinases (MMPs), that degrade the basement membrane and the extracellu-\nlar matrix. Subsequently, new sprouts are able to form by EC migration toward the tu-\nmour, up spatial gradients of TAF, followed by EC proliferation. Finally, stabilisation\nof the vessels, through the acquisition of a pericyte and smooth muscle cell covering,\nconcludes the angiogenic process. The stabilisation phase is usually incomplete in tu-\nmours, rendering the vessels leaky with a highly irregular flow (Carmeliet and Jain, 2000;\nJain, 2003).\nWe assume that angiogenic vessel growth occurs at rate p4C1(v0 + w), i.e. it is pro-\nportional to the concentration of TAF in the tumour and to the volume of pre-existing and\nangiogenesis-derived vasculature. We also allow for vessel occlusion (Griffon-Etienne et\nal., 1999; Helmlinger et al., 1997; Padera et al., 2004), assuming that the rate of occlusion\nis low when the ratio of tumour volume to vasculature, m\/v, is low, and that it increases\nto a maximum as m\/v increases. This assumption is motivated by the increased pressure\nand compression that vessels experience as the average tumour mass per vessel increases.\nAssuming further that the vessels undergo apoptosis at a rate d4w we obtain:\ndw\ndt\n= p4C1(v0 + w)\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nproliferation\n\u2212 \u03b41mw\nm + \u03b42v\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nocclusion\n\u2212 d4w\n\ufe38\ufe37\ufe37\ufe38\napoptosis\n, (5)\nwhere p4, \u03b41, \u03b42 and d4 are positive constants. We observe here that if TAF is absent\n(C1 = 0), then \u00b7w< 0 and the vessels will regress, i.e. our vessels correspond to newly-\nformed, immature vessels that depend on TAF (VEGF) for their survival (Carmeliet, 2003;\nHoeben et al., 2004).\n2.2.2. Vessels created by vasculogenesis, u(t)\nThe rate at which vasculogenic vessels are created from EPCs is proportional to the align-\nment term in (3) with a conversion factor, \u03bc, which converts the number of EPCs that\nper unit time arrange themselves into functional vessels, into units of volume. Here we\n2744 Stamper et al.\npoint out that it is not known at what point during vasculogenesis EPCs differentiate into\nECs (Schatteman and Awad, 2004). However, we assume that once the EPCs contribute\nto functional vessels they behave as ECs, i.e. the vasculogenic vessels may become oc-\ncluded, undergo apoptosis and proliferate in response to angiogenic factors. This means\nthat the net contribution from EPCs to the tumour vasculature stems from a purely vas-\nculogenic part (involving mobilisation from the bone marrow, adherence to the tumour\nsite and incorporation into vessels), and an angiogenic part (involving subsequent TAF-\ninduced proliferation). We therefore obtain:\ndu\ndt\n= \u03bck4z\n\ufe38\ufe37\ufe37\ufe38\nEPC alignment into vessels\n+ p5C1u\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nproliferation\n\u2212 \u03b43mu\nm + \u03b44v\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nocclusion\n\u2212 d5u\n\ufe38\ufe37\ufe37\ufe38\napoptosis\n, (6)\nwhere \u03bc, p5, \u03b43, \u03b44 and d5 are positive constants. We remark that if the vasculogenic\nvessels have the same characteristics as angiogenesis-derived vessels, then p5 = p4, \u03b43 =\n\u03b41, \u03b44 = \u03b42 and d5 = d4.\n2.3. Tumour volume, m(t)\nWe assume that the tumour volume, m(t), which we consider to be a mix of tumour cells\nand interstitial material, grows at a rate proportional to both m and a saturable function\nof the ratio v\/m. In particular, we assume that when v\/m is large, the tumour cells ex-\nperience optimal conditions for growth, receiving enough oxygen and nutrients from the\nvasculature to proliferate at their maximum rate. We also assume that the tumour cells\nundergo apoptosis at rate d0m and by combining these effects we deduce that:\ndm\ndt\n= \u03b2vm\nv + \u03bbm\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nproliferation\n\u2212 d0m\n\ufe38\ufe37\ufe37\ufe38\napoptosis\n, (7)\nwhere \u03b2 , \u03bb and d0 are positive constants. In describing the tumour volume in this way, we\nassume that tumour cells that die are degraded instantly, and thereafter do not contribute\nto the tumour volume.\n2.4. Mass balance equations for TAF\nThe last step in our model derivation is to obtain mass balance equations for the concen-\ntrations of TAF in the tumour, the blood and the bone marrow. In a physiological phar-\nmacokinetic model, each tissue is considered to consist of three phases: a vascular space,\nan interstitial space and a cellular space (Amidon et al., 2000; Gerlowski and Jain, 1983;\nShargel and Yu, 1999). However, if the rate of mass transfer across the capillary wall\nand the cellular membrane is rapid compared to the tissue perfusion rate, the tissue can\nbe assumed to be well mixed. Thus if the transfer is blood-flow-limited, then the TAF\nis homogeneously distributed within the vascular, interstitial and cellular spaces, and the\nconcentration in the tissue is an average over the three phases. Furthermore, by introduc-\ning partition coefficients, \u03b3i , for each modelled tissue i, where \u03b3i = CiCblood with Ci being\nthe concentration in tissue i at equilibrium and Cblood the concentration in the plasma at\nequilibrium, the concentration in the blood leaving the tissue i can be estimated as Ci\/\u03b3i .\nModelling the Role of Angiogenesis and Vasculogenesis 2745\nWe apply the blood-flow-limited assumption both in the tumour and the bone marrow.\nWe assume that TAF is produced by tumour cells under hypoxia and that it subsequently\nenters the blood. In the blood, we assume that TAF is taken up by the bone marrow and\nthat it also decreases due to natural decay, with rate constant r . This decay term also\nincludes uptake of TAF by organs which are not explicitly included in the model, e.g.\nliver and kidneys. By applying the principle of mass balance in each compartment, we\nobtain the following ODEs for C1, C2 and C3:\nd(C1V1)\ndt\n= cmH(m \u2212 \u0393 v)\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nproduction\n\u2212q1v\n(\nC1\n\u03b31\n\u2212 C2\n)\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\ndelivery from tumour\n, (8)\nd(C2V2)\ndt\n= q1v\n(\nC1\n\u03b31\n\u2212 C2\n)\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\ndelivery from tumour\n\u2212Q3\n(\nC2 \u2212 C3\n\u03b33\n)\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\ndelivery from blood\n\u2212 rC2V2\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nnatural decay\n, (9)\nd(C3V3)\ndt\n= Q3\n(\nC2 \u2212 C3\n\u03b33\n)\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\ndelivery from blood\n, (10)\nwhere V2 and V3, the volume of blood and bone marrow, respectively, are assumed to be\nconstant and V1, due to our flow-limited assumption, is the total tumour tissue volume,\ni.e.\nV1 = m + v. (11)\nIn (9)\u2013(10), we assume that the blood flow to the bone marrow, Q3, is constant, whereas in\n(8)\u2013(9), the blood flow to the tumour is proportional, with constant of proportionality q1,\nto the tumour vasculature, v. In (8), we assume that TAF production is proportional, with\nconstant of proportionality c, to mH(m \u2212 \u0393 v), where H is the Heaviside stepfunction\n(H(x) = 0 if x < 0 and H(x) = 1 if x \u2265 0). Thus, TAF production by tumour cells occurs\nonly when the ratio m\/v exceeds a threshold value, \u0393 . Since we do not model oxygen\nexplicitly, we regard \u0393 as an indicator of hypoxic conditions within the tumour. When\nm\/v > \u0393 , we suppose that, on average, there are not enough blood vessels to support the\ntumour mass and that this creates the hypoxic conditions which stimulate the tumour cells\nto produce TAF. We remark that an alternative form for the TAF production term involves\nreplacing the Heaviside stepfunction by a smooth approximation\nH(m \u2212 \u0393 v) \u2248 1\n2\n(\n1 + tanh\n(\nm \u2212 \u0393 v\n\b\n))\n, 0 < \b \u0005 1, (12)\nwhere the Heaviside stepfunction is recovered in the limit as \b \u2192 0. However, we use\nthe Heaviside function so that we can make analytical progress. Furthermore, when we\nperformed the analysis presented in Section 3 using (12) in place of the Heaviside step-\nfunction, the qualitative behaviour was unchanged (results not presented).\nTo summarise, our model comprises 9 ODEs and 2 algebraic relations for 11 dependent\nvariables. Before analysing the model, it is convenient to nondimensionalise and simplify\n2746 Stamper et al.\nit by making a quasi-steady assumption in the TAF equations, and thereby eliminating\nthe variables Ci (i = 1,2,3). The details of these steps are contained in Appendix A. We\nmerely state the final simplified and dimensionless equations in the following subsection.\n2.5. Simplified dimensionless equations\nFrom Appendix A, we deduce that, after eliminating the asterisks and the hats in the\ndimensionless equations, for notational simplicity, the final model equations are:\ndx\ndt\n= p1 + p2mH(m \u2212 \u0393 v) \u2212 k1x \u2212 k2mxH(m \u2212 \u0393 v) \u2212 d1x, (13)\ndy\ndt\n= k1x + k2mxH(m \u2212 \u0393 v) \u2212 k3(v + r)myH(m \u2212 \u0393 v) \u2212 d2y, (14)\ndz\ndt\n= k3(v + r)myH(m \u2212 \u0393 v) + p3(v + r)mzH(m \u2212 \u0393 v)\nv\n\u2212 k4z \u2212 d3z, (15)\ndu\ndt\n= k4z + p5(v + r)muH(m \u2212 \u0393 v)\nv\n\u2212 \u03b43mu\nm + \u03b44v \u2212 d5u, (16)\ndw\ndt\n= p4(v + r)m(1 + w)H(m \u2212 \u0393 v)\nv\n\u2212 \u03b41mw\nm + \u03b42v \u2212 d4w, (17)\ndm\ndt\n=\n(\nv\nv + m \u2212 d0\n)\nm, (18)\nv = w + u + 1. (19)\n3. Angiogenesis and vasculogenesis submodels\nBefore analysing the full model, we investigate the behaviour of two submodels, in which\nvessels are formed by either angiogenesis alone or vasculogenesis alone. This will yield\ninsight into whether the two mechanisms for vessel formation lead to different tumour\ngrowth dynamics. It will also allow for comparison with the results obtained in Komarova\nand Mironov (2005).\n3.1. Angiogenesis submodel\nIn this submodel, we assume that the EPCs are not affected by the tumour and that no\nvessels are formed by vasculogenesis. Thus, we fix p2 = k2 = k3 = 0 in (13)\u2013(15) and\nz = u = 0. We assume further that the levels of EPCs in the bone marrow and in the blood\nare at steady state, and hence that x and y satisfy (see (13)\u2013(14))\nx = p1\nk1 + d1 and y =\nk1p1\nd2(k1 + d1) . (20)\nThis steady state corresponds to the background levels that would exist in the bone marrow\nand the blood if no tumour were present; it is straightforward to show that the tumour-free\nsteady state is linearly stable to small perturbations in x and y.\nModelling the Role of Angiogenesis and Vasculogenesis 2747\nUnder the above assumptions, our model reduces to (17)\u2013(18), with v = w + 1, i.e.\ndw\ndt\n\u2261 W = p4(w + 1 + r)mH\n(\nm \u2212 \u0393 (w + 1)) \u2212 \u03b41mw\nm + \u03b42(w + 1) \u2212 d4w, (21)\ndm\ndt\n\u2261 M =\n(\nw + 1\nw + 1 + m \u2212 d0\n)\nm. (22)\nIt follows that three types of steady state solutions may arise:\n(i) A trivial steady state:\nm = w = 0. (23)\n(ii) An avascular steady state: If 0 < ( 1\nd0\n\u2212 1) < \u0393 , then no TAF is produced,\nm =\n(\n1\nd0\n\u2212 1\n)\nand w = 0. (24)\n(iii) Vascular states: If ( 1\nd0\n\u2212 1) \u2265 \u0393 , then TAF production is activated,\nm =\n(\n1\nd0\n\u2212 1\n)\n(w + 1) and\nw2 +Ww + 1 + r = 0, (25)\nwhere\nW =\n(\n2 + r \u2212 \u03b41\np4(\n1\nd0\n\u2212 1 + \u03b42)\n\u2212 d4\np4(\n1\nd0\n\u2212 1)\n)\n, (26)\nwhich gives the possibility of two vascular steady states. We see that the existence of\nphysically realistic solutions of (25) requiresW \u2264 \u2212\u221a4(1 + r). This implies that if\n\u03b41 and d4 (the death terms of the angiogenic vasculature) are relatively small, or p4\nand 1\/d0 (the proliferation of angiogenic vasculature and tumour) relatively large,\nthen the likelihood of vascular steady states diminishes.\nIt is clear that the dimensionless parameter 1\/d0, which represents the ratio of the\nmaximum tumour growth rate to the rate of tumour apoptosis, is the crucial bifurcation\nparameter. By fixing r , \u03b41, p4, d4 and \u03b42, we can determine how the steady state solutions\nchange as 1\/d0 varies. Here we have chosen the fixed parameter values so that the full\nrange of steady state behaviour is realised as 1\/d0 varies and in so doing we focus on the\nqualitative behaviour of the model (the values used are stated in Appendix B together with\na discussion of realistic parameter ranges). Figure 3 summarises the resulting behaviour.\nTo determine the local stability of the steady states, we note that for any steady states\nsuch that m \n= \u0393 (w + 1), the right-hand sides of (21) and (22) are differentiable with\nrespect to w and m. Therefore, the system is eligible for linear stability analysis (see\ne.g. Jordan and Smith, 1999). By linearising about each equilibrium point and computing\nthe associated Jacobian matrices, it is straightforward to show that the trivial solution is\n2748 Stamper et al.\nFig. 3 Bifurcation diagrams showing how the steady state solutions of (21) and (22) change as 1\/d0\nvaries. The trivial solution (m,w) = (0,0) exists for all values of 1\/d0 and is linearly stable when 1\/d0 < 1\nand unstable otherwise. When 1 < 1\/d0 < \u0393 + 1, there is a stable avascular steady state (i.e. w = 0 < m).\nDue to the Heaviside term in (21), there is a jump at 1\/d0 = \u0393 + 1 from the avascular steady state to two\nvascular steady states, which exist in an interval where 1\/d0 \u2265 \u0393 + 1. In this interval, the lower vascular\nsteady states are linearly stable while the upper ones are linearly unstable. For large values of 1\/d0, the\nvascular steady states disappear and only the unstable trivial solution exists. Key: solid line: local stability;\ndashed line: local instability. Parameter values: see Appendix B.\nlinearly stable if 1\/d0 < 1 and unstable if 1\/d0 > 1; i.e., introducing a small tumour into\nthe system will result in tumour decay if 1\/d0 < 1 and tumour growth if 1\/d0 > 1. (We\nnote that when 1\/d0 = 1, the trivial solution is a degenerate critical point.) Similarly, we\nfind that, where it exists, the avascular steady state is linearly stable. For the vascular\nsteady states, the Jacobian, A = (aij ), has the following elements:\na11 \u2261 \u2202W\n\u2202w\n= p4\n(\n1\nd0\n\u2212 1\n)\n(w + 1) \u2212 \u03b41(\n1\nd0\n\u2212 1)\n( 1\nd0\n\u2212 1 + \u03b42)2\n(\n1\nd0\n\u2212 1 + \u03b42\n(w + 1)\n)\n\u2212 d4,\n(27)\na12 \u2261 \u2202W\n\u2202m\n= p4(w + 1 + r) \u2212 \u03b41\u03b42w\n(w + 1)( 1\nd0\n\u2212 1 + \u03b42)2\n, (28)\na21 \u2261 \u2202M\n\u2202w\n= d20\n(\n1\nd0\n\u2212 1\n)2\n, (29)\nModelling the Role of Angiogenesis and Vasculogenesis 2749\na22 \u2261 \u2202M\n\u2202m\n= \u2212d20\n(\n1\nd0\n\u2212 1\n)\n, (30)\nwith w specified by (25). For linear stability in this case, we require the eigenvalues \u03bb of\nA to satisfy Re(\u03bb) < 0, i.e. tr(A) = a11 + a22 < 0 < det(A) = a11a22 \u2212 a12a21 \u2261 D. By\nsetting D = 0 and solving for w, we conclude that the determinant of A only vanishes\nat w = \u2212W\/2 \u2261 w\u00af corresponding to the double root of Eq. (25). Furthermore, along the\ncurve in (w,1\/d0)-space given by Eq. (25), we have\n\u2202D\n\u2202w\n= \u2202D\n\u2202w\n+ \u2202D\n\u2202(1\/d0)\n\u2202(1\/d0)\n\u2202w\n= \u22122p4(1\/d0 \u2212 1)2d20 +\n\u2202D\n\u2202(1\/d0)\n\u2202(1\/d0)\n\u2202w\n, (31)\nwhere \u2202(1\/d0)\n\u2202w\ncan be obtained implicitly from (25) and shown to satisfy \u2202(1\/d0)\n\u2202w\n|w\u00af = 0.\nThus, it follows that\n\u2202D\n\u2202w\n\u2223\n\u2223\n\u2223\n\u2223\nw\u00af\n= \u22122p4(1\/d0 \u2212 1)2d20 < 0, (32)\nwhich, together with the fact that D = 0, if and only if w = w\u00af, indicates that D > 0 on\nthe lower branch, where w = w\u00af \u2212\u221aw\u00af2 \u2212 (1 + r), and D < 0 on the upper branch, where\nw = w\u00af+\u221aw\u00af2 \u2212 (1 + r). Thus, the lower branch is stable provided that tr(A) < 0. In fact,\nthis is always the case since a11 < 0 and a22 = \u2212d20 (1\/d0 \u22121) < 0 (see (30)). To determine\nthat a11 < 0, we investigate the qualitative behaviour of the w-nullcline (from (21)) and\nthe m-nullcline (from (22)), and deduce that the sign of W must change from positive to\nnegative, as we go along a line which is parallel to the w-axis and crosses the w-nullcline\nat the first steady state (see e.g. Murray, 1993), i.e. a11 \u2261 \u2202W\u2202w < 0. Regarding the steady\nstates on the upper branch, we note that they always correspond to saddles, because the\neigenvalues are real and of opposite signs.\nTo illustrate the range of behaviours that can occur, we compute phase planes and\nnumerical solutions to the model equations. We suppose that initially w = 0 < m, in\nwhich case the tumour must rely on the background vasculature for its initial nutrient\nsupply. This corresponds to implanting into a tissue an avascular tumour of size m > 0 at\nt = 0 or possibly to monitoring an avascular tumour that developed previously (for t < 0).\nWe integrate Eqs. (21)\u2013(22) numerically using a Runge\u2013Kutta method (MATLAB\u2019s ODE\nsolvers).\nA typical phase plane illustrating the behaviour when there are two vascular steady\nstates is presented in Fig. 4. Dependent on the initial tumour size, three qualitatively dif-\nferent types of behaviour are observed. When the initial tumour is small, it undergoes\navascular growth in response to the existing vasculature (see trajectory with initial condi-\ntion w(0) = 0, m(0) = 2). TAF production and angiogenesis switch on when the vascular\ndensity v\/m = (w + 1)\/m decreases to 1\/\u0393 . As m and w further increase, angiogenesis\nslows down due to increased occlusion and apoptosis of the vessels. This causes the vascu-\nlar density to drop (as the trajectory meets the w-nullcline) and the tumour evolves to the\nstable vascular equlibrium. If the initial tumour is intermediate-sized (e.g. m(0) = 30)\nthen the tumour produces angiogenic factors immediately (since (w + 1)\/m < 1\/\u0393 ).\nHowever, in spite of new vessel growth, the tumour volume still decreases. This is be-\ncause the angiogenic response is insufficient to sustain the tumour, i.e. the resulting vas-\ncular density is such that the tumour cell proliferation rate is smaller than the rate of\n2750 Stamper et al.\nFig. 4 (w,m)-phase plane diagram illustrating the behaviour of our angiogenesis submodel (Eqs.\n(21)\u2013(22)) when there are three steady state solutions: an unstable trivial solution, a locally stable vas-\ncularised solution and an unstable vascularised solution. Three trajectories are presented showing how\nthe initial size of the tumour affects its evolution. For small tumours (e.g. m(0) = 2), the tumour un-\ndergoes a transient period of avascular growth until it becomes large enough to stimulate an angiogenic\nresponse. Thereafter, the tumour evolves to the stable vascular state. For intermediate-sized tumours (e.g.\nm(0) = 30), the tumour is large enough to elicit an angiogenic response immediately. Its volume, m, de-\ncreases slowly compared to the vasculature until the system meets the w-nullcline and enters the basin of\nattraction of the stable vascular steady state. For larger-sized tumours (e.g. m(0) = 50), unbounded growth\nensues.

When the vasculature starts to decrease due to occlusion and apoptosis, the\ntumour evolves to the stable vascular equilibrium. In contrast, an initially large tumour\nmass (e.g. m(0) = 50) induces a stronger angiogenic response, which enables the tumour\nto undergo unbounded growth. We note here that, consistent with our model\u2019s bifurcation\nstructure, it has been shown experimentally, in Ke et al. (2000), that tumour growth de-\npends on the angiogenic phenotype. Upon implantation of different glioma cell lines, the\ntumour volume remained constant or decreased for cell lines that were less angiogenic\n(i.e. secreted low amounts of VEGF), while tumour types of higher angiogenic capacity\nincreased rapidly in size (Ke et al., 2000).\nModelling the Role of Angiogenesis and Vasculogenesis 2751\nIn Fig. 4, we see that when the tumour grows unboundedly, (w + 1)\/m \u2192 1\/\u0393 .\nThis will always be the case when growth is unbounded, because if m and w are suf-\nficiently large in the region of TAF production, then dw\/dt \u000b dm\/dt (from (21) and\n(22) we note that the growth term in (21) is dominant when m and w are large). This\nwill ultimately cause the vector field dm\/dw to become horizontal, and point toward\nthe curve m = \u0393 (w + 1), which we henceforth term the discontinuity boundary. On the\nother hand, where m < \u0393 (w + 1), the vector field always points in the opposite direc-\ntion since dw\/dt < 0 and dm\/dt > 0. As a result, any trajectory which hits the boundary\ncannot leave it. This corresponds to so-called \u201csliding\u201d on the discontinuity boundary (di\nBernardo et al., 2005; Leine et al., 2000).\nIn order to determine how solutions evolve on the discontinuity boundary, we exploit\nthe fact that (21) has a discontinuous right-hand side to write Eqs. (21) and (22) as a\nFilippov system (di Bernardo et al., 2005; Leine et al., 2000):\ndx\ndt\n=\n{\nf 1 if h > 0,\nf 2 if h < 0,\n(33)\nwhere x = (w,m),\nf 1 =\n[\np4(w + 1 + r)m \u2212 \u03b41mw\nm + \u03b42(w + 1) \u2212 d4w,\n(w + 1)m\n(w + 1) + m \u2212 d0m\n]\n, (34)\nf 2 =\n[\n\u2212 \u03b41mw\nm + \u03b42(w + 1) \u2212 d4w,\n(w + 1)m\n(w + 1) + m \u2212 d0m\n]\n(35)\nand h = m \u2212 \u0393 (w + 1), so that h = 0 is the discontinuity boundary. The vector f =\n(w\u02d9, m\u02d9))|h=0 is given by\nf = \u03b1f 1 + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)f 2, where 0 \u2264 \u03b1 =\nprojn f 2\nprojn(f 2 \u2212 f 1)\n\u2264 1 (36)\nand projn f 2 is the projection of f 2 onto the normal, n = \u2207h = (\u2212\u0393,1), to the disconti-\nnuity boundary. In our case, the time derivative on the switching boundary becomes\nf =\n(\n1\n\u0393\n[\n(w + 1)\n(w + 1) + m \u2212 d0\n]\nm,\n[\n(w + 1)\n(w + 1) + m \u2212 d0\n]\nm\n)\n=\n[\n1\n1 + \u0393 \u2212 d0\n]\n(\n(w + 1),m). (37)\nThus, on the switching manifold, m and w grow exponentially with rate 1\/(1 + \u0393 ) \u2212 d0,\nprovided that the nullcline of m lies above the switching boundary, i.e. 1\/d0 > \u0393 + 1.\n3.2. Vasculogenesis submodel\nIf we assume vasculogenesis is dominant, then p4 = w = 0 in (17) and our model re-\nduces to Eqs. (13)\u2013(16) and (18) with v = u+ 1. There may be the following steady state\nsolutions:\n2752 Stamper et al.\n(i) A trivial steady state:\nm = 0, u = 0, z = 0, y = k1p1\nd2(k1 + d1) and x =\np1\nk1 + d1 .

(39)\nAs for the trivial steady state, the levels of EPCs in the bone marrow and blood are at\nthe natural background levels.\n(iii) Vascular steady states: If ( 1\nd0\n\u2212 1) \u2265 \u0393 , then there is active TAF production and\nwe have:\nm =\n(\n1\nd0\n\u2212 1\n)\n(u + 1), x = p1 + p2m\nk1 + k2m + d1 ,\ny = [k1 + k2m]x\nk3(u + 1 + r)m + d2 , (40)\nz = k3(u + 1)(u + 1 + r)my\n(k4 + d3)(u + 1) \u2212 p3(u + 1 + r)m, (41)\nwhere u satisfies a sixth-order polynomial:\nf\u00af (u) = g(u) \u2212 f (u) = 0, (42)\nwith\ng(u) = p5p3k3k2\n(\n1\nd0\n\u2212 1\n)4\nu\n5\n\u220f\ni=1\n(u \u2212 Gi), (43)\nG1 = 1\np5(\n1\nd0\n\u2212 1)\n(\n\u03b43(\n1\nd0\n\u2212 1)\n1\nd0\n\u2212 1 + \u03b44\n+ d5\n)\n\u2212 (1 + r),\nG2 = k4 + d3\np3(\n1\nd0\n\u2212 1) \u2212 (1 + r), (44)\nG3,4 = \u2212 (2 + r)2 \u00b1\n\u221a\n(2 + r)2 \u2212 4(1 + r + d2\nk3(\n1\nd0\n\u22121) )\n2\n,\nG5 = \u2212k1 \u2212 d1\nk2(\n1\nd0\n\u2212 1) \u2212 1, (45)\nModelling the Role of Angiogenesis and Vasculogenesis 2753\nf (u) = k4k3k2p2\n(\n1\nd0\n\u2212 1\n)3 4\n\u220f\ni=1\n(u \u2212 Fi), (46)\nF1 = \u2212(1 + r), F2 = \u22121, F3 = \u2212k1\nk2(\n1\nd0\n\u2212 1) \u2212 1 and\nF4 = \u2212p1\np2(\n1\nd0\n\u2212 1) \u2212 1. (47)\nIt is possible to show that (42) has at most two physically realistic vascular solutions and\nthat their existence depends on the sign of the zeros of (43) (see Appendix C for details).\nAs for the angiogenesis submodel, linear stability analysis reveals that the trivial so-\nlution is stable if 1\/d0 < 1 (and unstable otherwise), and that the avascular solution is\nlocally stable where it exists. The stability of the vascular steady state solutions was de-\ntermined using the dynamical systems package XPPAUT (Ermentrout, 2002). Numerical\nsimulations using a wide range of parameter values suggest that the bifurcation structure\nof the vasculogenesis submodel is similar to that for the angiogenesis submodel (shown\nin Fig. 3). In particular, where they exist, vascular steady states on the upper branch are\nunstable while those on the lower branch are locally stable.\n4. Full model\nBased on the analysis of the angiogenesis and vasculogenesis submodels, we conclude\nthat similar steady states and bifurcations are exhibited by tumours in which either angio-\ngenesis or vasculogenesis dominates. To see whether the bifurcation structure is the same\nwhen both vascularisation mechanisms are active, we analysed the full model, consisting\nof Eqs. (13)\u2013(19). Our analysis shows that a trivial steady state solution always exists,\nsatisfying (38) and w = 0. As in the submodels, the tumour-free steady state solution is\nlinearly stable if 1\/d0 < 1 (and unstable otherwise). Furthermore, depending on whether\n( 1\nd0\n\u2212 1) < \u0393 , avascular or vascular steady states can occur. The avascular steady state\nsolution, which satisfies (39) and w = 0, is linearly stable. As for the vasculogenic sub-\nmodel, to characterise the vascular steady states, we explored the full model numerically\nfor a range of parameter values. We always obtained bifurcation diagrams similar in form\nto Fig. 3, which suggests that the bifurcation structure for the submodels is preserved\nwhen angiogenesis and vasculogenesis occur simultaneously.\nMotivated by the seemingly contradictory reports on both the extent of vasculogen-\nesis in tumours and its impact on tumour growth rate, in the remainder of this section,\nwe investigate its importance as the tumour either evolves to a vascular steady state or\nundergoes unbounded growth. We calculate the proportion of vasculogenic neovascula-\nture, PVN = u\/(w + u), and use it to characterise a vascular tumour as vasculogenic\nif PVN > 0.5 and angiogenic otherwise. We also examine how the combination of an-\ngiogenesis and vasculogenesis affects the tumour\u2019s overall growth rate. Furthermore, we\nestablish how the degree of vasculogenesis and its effect on tumour growth change as\ncertain selected model parameters are varied.\n2754 Stamper et al.\nIn Fig. 5, we present results for a simulation in which the tumour undergoes unbounded\ngrowth. Where possible, we have chosen realistic parameter values (see Appendix B for\na discussion); other values were chosen so that the resulting (dimensional) level of TAF\n(VEGF) in the blood, C2, and the proportion of vasculogenic neovasculature, PVN, are\nsimilar over time to those reported in Spring et al. (2005) for hepatocellular carcinoma in\nAlb-Tag mice (where tumour growth was monitored over a period of 16 weeks). We note\nthat the initial contribution from vasculogenesis is low, a result which is consistent with\nthe observations in Spring et al. (2005) where the proportion of EPC-derived vasculature\nincreased from approximately 3% at week 10 to 28% at week 16 (in Fig. 5 corresponding\nto time points 49 and 78, respectively). From Fig. 5, we note also that the level of EPCs\nin the blood, y (which was not given in Spring et al. (2005)), at first increases due to\nthe increasing level of TAF in the blood (as for example observed in burn and vascular\ntrauma patients, where the blood level of EPCs reflects the circulatory level of VEGF (Gill\net al., 2001)). However, over time, as tumour growth advances, y reaches a maximum\nvalue before dropping to low levels (here the maximum corresponds to a dimensional\nvalue of roughly 4500 cells\/ml, comparable to levels seen in cancer patients (Dome et\nal., 2006)). The decrease in y over time occurs because as the tumour and the vasculature\ngrow unboundedly, the adherence term (with coefficient k3) ultimately becomes dominant\nin the y-equation (14), corroborating theoretical predictions in Komarova and Mironov\n(2005) that the level of EPCs in the blood will decline at large times. In Komarova and\nMironov (2005), the drop in circulating EPCs was accompanied by a drop in the level of\nEPCs in the bone marrow, x, and a decrease in the contribution from vasculogenesis at\nlarge times. However, these features are not present in our model (as evident from Fig. 5)\ndue to our assumption that the EPCs may proliferate in response to TAF both within the\nbone marrow and the tumour. Thus, in our model low levels of EPCs in the blood may\nnot be an indicator of low vasculogenesis, but instead an indicator of their relatively short\ntransit time in the bloodstream, i.e. rapid adherence at the tumour site.\nIn Fig. 6, we show how, in cases for which the tumour grows unboundedly, the inclu-\nsion of vasculogenesis increases its growth rate and affects its growth dynamics compared\nto cases for which only angiogenesis is active. We do this by varying p3, the prolifera-\ntion rate of the EPCs, and k4, the rate at which EPCs form vessels. The initial conditions\nare chosen so that the tumour is avascular but large enough that it starts producing TAF\nimmediately (thus the system initially evolves on the discontinuity boundary). Due to in-\ncreased occlusion and apoptosis, over time the vascular density falls in all cases. However,\nthe inclusion of vasculogenesis leads to higher vascular densities, and therefore increased\ntumour growth. When p3 is high (p3 = 0.002), the vasculogenic response is slower when\nk4 is small (k4 = 0.001) than when it is large (k4 = 0.5); note that initially PVN is smaller.\nHowever, with k4 small, the effect of vasculogenesis on the tumour\u2019s long-term growth\nrate is stronger. This is because a small value of k4 allows EPCs to accumulate within\nthe tumour, and subsequently this population of EPCs expands due to rapid proliferation\nin response to TAF. Thus, the level of EPCs increases to high values, and vasculogenesis\noutstrips angiogenesis (PVN \u2192 1). By contrast, if p3 is small (p3 = 0.0002), then the\ntumour is less vasculogenic. In this case, the tumour\u2019s growth rate is affected more if k4\nis high (k4 = 0.5); when both k4 and p3 are small (k4 = 0.001 and p3 = 0.0002) the PVN\nis low and the tumour\u2019s growth rate does not change markedly (on this time scale) when\nvasculogenesis is included (simulation not presented).\nModelling the Role of Angiogenesis and Vasculogenesis 2755\nFig. 5 Series of curves (solutions of (13)\u2013(19)) showing how, in the case of unbounded growth, the level\nof EPCs in the bone marrow, x, the level of EPCs in the blood, y, the tumour volume, m, the level of TAF\nin the blood, C2, and the proportion of vasculogenic vasculature, PVN, evolve over time. We observe that\nthe contribution from vasculogenesis becomes more pronounced at large times. The level of EPCs in the\nblood, y, first reflects the level of TAF in the blood. With time y reaches a maximum and then drops to low\nlevels, in contrast to x which rises and remains at an elevated level. Parameter values: see Appendix B.\nIn these simulations 1\/d0 = 9. The initial conditions are: m = 4, u = 0, w = 0, z = 0, y = 3\/520 and\nx = 1\/13 at t = 0.\nWe remark that since on the discontinuity boundary the vascular density attains the\nlargest value possible for the tumour to still produce angiogenic factors, it corresponds\nto the maximum possible growth rate of a vascularised tumour. By increasing the pro-\nliferation rate and decreasing the occlusion rate of the angiogenic vessels, we obtained\ncases where the inclusion of vasculogenic vasculature did not noticeably increase the\ntumour growth rate. In these cases, angiogenesis was so strong that the tumour vasculari-\nsation took place exclusively on the discontinuity boundary, and the extra vasculogenesis-\nderived vasculature did not have an impact. We also note that this works both ways, i.e.\nif vasculogenesis is strong enough then adding angiogenesis may not have a perceivable\nimpact.\nWe end this section by showing in Fig. 7 where in (p4, p3)-space and (p4, k3)-space\nvascular steady states exist (in the shaded regions) and how the total vasculature, v, and\nthe PVN associated with the stable vascular steady state solution vary with p3 and p4\n(panels A and B, respectively) and with k3 and p4 (panels C and D, respectively). The pa-\nrameter p3 relates to EPC proliferation, k3 to the rate of EPC adhesion to the vessel wall\n2756 Stamper et al.\nFig. 6 Series of curves (solutions of (13)\u2013(19)) showing how, in the case of unbounded growth, vary-\ning the vasculogenic response by altering the rate of EPC proliferation, p3, and the rate of EPC vessel\nformation, k4, influences tumour volume, m, vascular density, v\/m, proportion vasculogenic neovascu-\nlature, PVN, and number of EPCs in the tumour, z. For comparison, a case where only angiogenesis is\nactive is also presented (solid line in each panel). We observe that when both angiogenesis and vascu-\nlogenesis contribute to the vasculature, then the tumour grows larger than in the case with angiogenesis\nonly. The increase in tumour volume occurs because the inclusion of vasculogenesis results in higher\nvascular densities. When both p3 and k4 are large (dashed-dotted line), vasculogenic vessels form more\nrapidly, resulting in the highest PVN initially. However, if p3 is large while k4 is small (dashed line),\nvasculogenesis ultimately dominates with PVN \u2192 1. In this case, the number of EPCs increases to high\nlevels. If p3 is small and k4 large (dotted line), then the level of vasculogenesis is always low and the\neffect on tumour volume is minimal. Key: solid line: angiogenesis only; dotted line: angiogenesis and\nvasculogenesis with (k4,p3) = (0.5,0.0002); dashed-dotted line: angiogenesis and vasculogenesis with\n(k4,p3) = (0.5,0.002); dashed line: angiogenesis and vasculogenesis with (k4,p3) = (0.001,0.002). Pa-\nrameter values: see Appendix B, with p2 = k2 = k3 = 0 for the angiogenesis-only case. In these simula-\ntions 1\/d0 = 9 which corresponds to unbounded growth for all cases. The initial conditions are: m = 4,\nu = 0, w = 0, z = 0, y = 3\/520 and x = 1\/13 at t = 0.\nand p4 to EC proliferation. We see that for a fixed value of p3, increasing p4 increases\nthe total vasculature, v, at the steady state (panel A). A similar increase in v is obtained\nif, for a fixed value of p4, p3 increases. Since m = ( 1d0 \u2212 1)v at the steady state, this also\nleads to an increase in tumour volume. Therefore, when vasculogenesis and angiogenesis\nact simultaneously, the tumour grows to a larger equilibrium size than when either vas-\nculogenesis or angiogenesis act in isolation. We also note that if these parameters exceed\nthreshold values, then the steady states are lost and unbounded growth ensues. This means\nModelling the Role of Angiogenesis and Vasculogenesis 2757\nFig. 7 Two sets of bifurcation diagrams showing how at the stable vascular steady state the total vascula-\nture (left panels) and the proportion vasculogenic neovasculature (right panels) vary as either p3 and p4 or\nk3 and p4 are varied. Here, white areas correspond to unbounded vascular growth; thus, if the parameters\nexceed threshold values, the vascular steady states are lost. (A, B) Panel A shows that as the rate of EPC\nproliferation, p3, and the rate of EC proliferation, p4, increase, the total vasculature, v, increases at the\nsteady state. In panel B, the proportion vasculogenic neovasculature, PVN, is largest when p3 is large and\np4 small. (C, D) An increase in the rate of EPC adhesion, k3, or the rate of EC proliferation, p4, leads to\nadditional vasculature at the stable steady state (panel C), with vasculogenesis dominating (PVN > 0.5) for\nlarge k3 and small p4 (panel D). Parameter values: as in Appendix B, with 1\/d0 = 6. In these simulations\nwe also fix p5 = p4.\nthat the addition of extra vasculature due to vasculogenesis (or angiogenesis) could cause\na previously stable vascular tumour to undergo unbounded growth.\nRegarding the proportion of vasculogenesis-derived vessels, we observe that it is\nlargest when p3 is high and p4 low (Fig. 7, panel B). Interestingly, for a fixed value of p3,\nPVN first decreases as p4 increases and then increases; thus PVN is lowest for intermedi-\nate values of p4. An increase in p4 initially affects angiogenesis more than vasculogenesis;\nthis is because the proliferation of the background vasculature produces only angiogenic\nvessels (compare the terms with coefficients p4 and p5 in (17) and (16), respectively). As\np4 is increased further, however, the relative contribution from vasculogenesis increases\nsince the increase in p4 causes an increase in v and m, which enhances the proliferation\nof z until, for p4 sufficiently large, vasculogenesis exceeds angiogenesis (see the term\nwith coefficient k4 in (16)). This is consistent with the behaviour described above for the\ncase of unbounded growth that suggests that vasculogenesis becomes more dominant as\n2758 Stamper et al.\ntumour growth accelerates. In Fig. 7, we note that trends similar to those described above\noccur when k3 is varied with p4 (see panels C and D). We remark here that in Fig. 7, we\nfix p4 = p5, however, qualitatively similar observations hold when p4 \n= p5 and only p4\nis varied.\n4.1. Therapeutic implications\nBelow we discuss general treatment strategies, focusing on qualitative behaviour rather\nthan the precise details associated with a particular therapy. In general, chemotherapy\nacts on the tumour directly by killing proliferating tumour cells, while anti-angiogenic\ntreatments act indirectly by inhibiting the growth of new vasculature.\nThe affected model parameter in the case of chemotherapy is 1\/d0, i.e. the ratio of\nthe maximum tumour proliferation rate to the tumour cell apoptosis rate. From the bifur-\ncation diagrams, presented in Fig. 3, we conclude that as 1\/d0 decreases tumour growth\nis inhibited. In particular, we note that if 1\/d0 is low enough, then the tumour will be\neradicated, or persist in an avascular state. An effective treatment strategy could therefore\ninvolve applying a drug which decreases 1\/d0 by increasing the tumour apoptosis rate. In\nFig. 8, two different chemotherapy protocols are applied to a vascularised tumour which\ninitially grows unboundedly (1\/d0 = 9). While a single dose of chemotherapy temporarily\ninhibits tumour growth, unbounded growth resumes once 1\/d0 returns to its initial value,\ncorresponding to treatment being stopped (Fig. 8, panels A and B). To maintain the tu-\nmour in an avascular state, the treatment must be continued. Alternatively, if the tumour\nis continuously infused with a weaker drug or a lower dose (corresponding to a higher\nvalue of 1\/d0), then the tumour may be managed as a small vascularised mass (see Fig. 8,\npanels C and D). If the lower strength dose is given initially, however, this has a negligible\ninhibitory effect; the tumour undergoes monotonic expansion (results not presented).\nWhen simulating therapies that target the vasculature, the way in which the anti-\nangiogenic drug acts determines which model parameters should be altered. Consider,\nfor example, a toxin such as VEGF-A121-DT385 conjugate, which inhibits EC prolifer-\nation by binding to the VEGF-receptor VEGFR-2 (Hoeben et al., 2004). In our model,\nsuch behaviour can be achieved by reducing the parameters p4 and p5. If we assume that\nthe therapy has the same effect on EPCs, which are also VEGFR-2-positive (Stoll et al.,\n2003), then the parameter p3 would also be reduced. Alternative approaches involve in-\nhibiting EC migration by targeting integrins, such as \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 (Stoll et al., 2003),\nor decreasing the tumour secretion of VEGF, which, according to Hoeben et al. (2004),\nis how the agent Rapamycin acts. In our model, the latter approach corresponds to reduc-\ning the dimensional parameter c, and therefore the dimensionless parameter groupings\nk2, k3, p2, p3, p4 and p5 (see Appendix (A.25)). Alternatively, the level of active TAF\ncould be reduced by introducing an antibody which blocks VEGF\u2019s binding to its recep-\ntors (Hoeben et al., 2004; Stoll et al., 2003). In Fig. 9, we contrast the treatment outcome\nif only EC proliferation is targeted with a case targeting only EPC proliferation as well as\na case of a combination treatment inhibiting TAF production. We model the different sit-\nuations by decreasing the relevant parameters to 10% of their initial value while treatment\nis being administered. Figure 9 (panel A) shows that if the tumour has a relatively high\nEPC proliferation rate and a low EC proliferation rate, then targeting only ECs is inef-\nfective, whereas targeting only EPCs is almost as effective as the combination treatment.\nThe opposite holds true if the tumour has a relatively low EPC proliferation rate and a\nModelling the Role of Angiogenesis and Vasculogenesis 2759\nFig. 8 Two sets of simulations (of (13)\u2013(19)) showing how the tumour volume (right panels) is affected\nby two different chemotherapy protocols (left panels).

Furthermore, if both EC and EPC prolifera-\ntion are strong (Fig. 9, panel B), then the individual treatments are ineffective compared\nto the combination treatment. These therapy outcomes are consistent with the bifurcation\ndiagram presented in Fig. 10. From Fig. 10, it is clear that for a tumour with a large value\nof p3 and a small value of p4 (point marked by a lowercase a in Fig. 10), a therapy which\nreduces only p4 will have little effect on the tumour growth rate since no steady state is\ninduced (the tumour will continue to undergo unbounded vascular growth). By contrast,\nif the tumour has a small value of p3 and a large value of p4 (point c in Fig. 10), then\nonly a treatment that decreases p4 may halt the tumour growth. Finally, if the rates of EC\nand EPC proliferation are both high (point b in Fig. 10), a steady state is only achieved\nby targeting both p3 and p4, i.e. individual treatments will not be as effective as a com-\nbination treatment. We also remark that if started too late (i.e. when the tumour is large),\nthen the therapies may be less effective since the tumour may have outgrown the basin of\n2760 Stamper et al.\nFig. 9 Series of simulations (of (13)\u2013(19)) showing how the tumour\u2019s response to different vascula-\nture-targeting therapies depends on the model parameters p3 and p4 that relate to EPC and EC prolif-\neration, respectively.

Discussion\nWe have developed an ODE model which describes how a tumour can become vascu-\nlarised by angiogenesis and vasculogenesis and, compared to earlier models (Komarova\nand Mironov, 2005; Stoll et al., 2003), includes some additional characteristics of tumour\nModelling the Role of Angiogenesis and Vasculogenesis 2761\nFig. 10 Bifurcation diagram showing where in (p4, p3)-space vascular steady states exist (in the shaded\nregions) and, where they do, how the total vasculature, v, associated with the stable vascular steady state\nsolution changes with p3 and p4. The diagram suggests that for a tumour which is growing unboundedly\nwith a relatively high EPC proliferation rate and low EC proliferation rate (point marked a), anti-vascular\ntherapy should focus mainly on decreasing EPC proliferation, since the only possible way to obtain a stable\nsteady state from this point is by decreasing p3. The opposite applies for a tumour with a high value of p4\nand a low value of p3 (point marked c); here only a lower value of p4 may introduce a steady state. If the\nrates of EPC and EC proliferation both are high (point marked b), then a steady state can only be achieved\nby lowering both parameters. Parameter values: as in Appendix B, with 1\/d0 = 9. In these simulations, we\nalso fix p5 = p4.\ngrowth. An important new feature is our assumption that the vascular density, v\/m, is\nan indicator of hypoxia within the tumour, and thus, correlates with TAF production; in\nour model TAF production is activated only if the vascular density drops below a certain\nthreshold value. As a result, we can capture the tumour\u2019s transition from an avascular to a\nvascular state. We also account for occlusion of newly formed vessels, assuming that this\nincreases when the ratio of tumour volume to vascular volume is high, this ratio being\nindicative of the pressure that is being exerted by the tumour cells on the vessels.\nFrom our analysis of the angiogenic and vasculogenic submodels, we conclude that tu-\nmours for which angiogenesis or vasculogenesis are dominant can grow in similar ways.\nIn both cases, and for the full model too, the key bifurcation parameter is the ratio of\nthe maximum tumour cell proliferation rate to the apoptosis rate, 1\/d0. As this parameter\nvaries, the tumour may evolve to an avascular or a vascular steady state or it may un-\ndergo exponential growth at a rate which is ultimately determined by the vascular density,\n2762 Stamper et al.\nv\/m = 1\/\u0393 , that corresponds to on-switch of TAF production (the discontinuity bound-\nary). Since both submodels have similar bifurcation structures and unbounded growth is\nexponential in time, we infer that it would be difficult to distinguish between tumours in\nwhich angiogenesis or vasculogenesis dominates, on the basis of their growth dynamics\nalone. By contrast, in Komarova and Mironov (2005), angiogenesis or vasculogenesis al-\nways led to unbounded growth with angiogenic tumours growing as a cubic power of time\nat large times and vasculogenic tumours ultimately growing linearly in time.\nOur analysis of the full model shows that both when the tumour evolves to a vas-\ncular equilibrium and undergoes exponential growth, the model parameters control the\nproportion of vasculogenesis-derived vasculature. Our predictions seem consistent with\nexperimental data from different tumours which show a large variation in the proportion\nof vasculogenesis-derived vasculature (Aghi and Chiocca, 2005). Factors that might de-\ntermine the proportion of vasculogenic vessels are tumour strain, microenvironment and\ntumour age (Aghi and Chiocca, 2005). While the predictions in Komarova and Mironov\n(2005) indicate that, due to depletion of EPCs in the bone marrow and the circulation,\nangiogenesis will ultimately dominate vasculogenesis, our model suggests that vasculo-\ngenesis can be the dominant mechanism at large times. We conclude that in Komarova\nand Mironov (2005), the effects of vasculogenesis are transient whereas they can persist\nin our model. The differences in the models\u2019 predictions can be explained by the different\nmodelling assumptions made. In Komarova and Mironov (2005), the growth rate of the\nvasculogenic vessels is simply proportional to the product of the tumour surface area and\nthe level of EPCs in the blood, while the growth rate of angiogenic vessels is only pro-\nportional to the tumour surface area (motivated by the fact that vessels mainly grow at the\nedge of the tumour). Furthermore, the model in Komarova and Mironov (2005) does not\ninclude TAF-induced replenishment of EPCs in the bone marrow and does not incorporate\nEPC and subsequent EC proliferation (once the EPCs have differentiated into ECs) at the\ntumour site. As a result, in Komarova and Mironov (2005) the levels of EPCs in the bone\nmarrow and the blood decrease at large times, causing angiogenesis to become dominant.\nAlthough in the case of unbounded growth, depletion of EPCs in the blood does occur in\nour model, this does not necessarily mean that the contribution from vasculogenesis de-\ncreases. In fact, in our model angiogenesis dominates initially, while vasculogenesis may\ncontribute substantially later. This is consistent with experiments in Spring et al. (2005)\nwhich suggest that vasculogenesis becomes more important in the later stages of tumour\ngrowth. Further experiments that allow the characterisation of the short- and long-term\ngrowth dynamics of angiogenic and vasculogenic tumours would help to compare our\npredictions and those of Komarova and Mironov (2005).\nAnalysis of our model shows that vasculogenesis can increase the tumour growth rate.\nIndeed, from our bifurcation analysis, it follows that when a tumour is growing toward a\nvascular steady state with new vessels forming via angiogenesis alone, the inclusion of\nvasculogenesis may push the tumour into unbounded growth. In Stoll et al. (2003), an\nincrease in tumour growth rate was predicted but only observed after a certain time, this\nbeing attributed to the time it takes EPCs to mobilise and incorporate into the tumour vas-\nculature. This is consistent with our simulations that show that angiogenesis dominates\nnew vessel formation during early vascular tumour growth. By decreasing k4, the rate\nat which EPCs align into vessels, it is possible to increase further the time required by\nthe EPCs to form functional vasculature (another modelling approach would be to intro-\nduce a time delay). A delay in the vasculogenic response was observed in both Tepper et\nModelling the Role of Angiogenesis and Vasculogenesis 2763\nal. (2005) and Vajkoczy et al. (2003), where the EPCs first arranged themselves in clus-\nters in the interstitial space and, only after 2 weeks and a few days, respectively, formed\nvascular structures. In our model, it is also possible that an increased growth rate is not\nobserved, even though part of the vasculature is vasculogenesis-derived. This happens\nif the angiogenic response can meet the demands of the growing tumour, allowing it to\ngrow with maximum vascular density on the discontinuity boundary. In Vajkoczy et al.\n(2003), a lack of vasculogenic effect was also observed experimentally; even though in-\njected (embryonic) EPCs incorporated into the tumour vasculature, their doing so did not\nsignificantly alter the vascular density or the tumour\u2019s growth rate.\nOur investigation of different treatment strategies reveals that when considering\nvasculature-targeting therapies, it may, dependent on the parameter values, be necessary\nto use a combination treatment that inhibits both angiogenesis (ECs) and vasculogenesis\n(EPCs) to obtain an effective response.\nTo focus on future work and possible model improvements in the case of unbounded\ngrowth, we note that because the proliferation rate of the vessels does not saturate with\nthe TAF concentration, high levels of TAF imply that vessel growth dominates over vessel\ndeath. Furthermore, since the tumour growth rate is a saturating function of vascular den-\nsity, the vessels will grow faster than the tumour at high levels of TAF. Because of this,\nthe vector field in the region where TAF production is active will point toward the discon-\ntinuity boundary at large times. At the same time, in the region of no TAF production, the\nvector field points toward the same boundary, causing unbounded growth to ultimately\noccur on the discontinuity boundary. By introducing saturating functions for the EC and\nEPC proliferation terms, as well as the term modelling EPC adherence to the vessel wall,\nour model could be made more realistic. This would be especially important if the prolif-\neration rates are not very TAF sensitive but saturate quickly as the concentration of TAF\nis increased. We anticipate that the introduction of saturating functions, in addition to in-\ntroducing further steady states, could alter the system so that unbounded growth would\nnot necessarily take place on the discontinuity boundary. However, we remark that such\na model would still break down at some point in time in the case of unbounded growth,\nsince exponential growth cannot occur indefinitely due to spatial constraints.\nFinally, it is also important to bear in mind that tumours are spatially heterogeneous\nwith regions of proliferation, quiescence and necrosis, which cannot always be accurately\ndescribed by spatially-averaged models; see Breward et al. (2003), Byrne et al. (2006),\nMcDougall et al. (2006) for some examples of models that include spatial effects. Fur-\nthermore, because there are many different TAFs and all of these are produced locally,\nimbalances in pro- and anti-angiogenic substances are also likely to influence the devel-\noping vasculature. By explicitly distinguishing between mature and immature vessels, as\nfor instance was done in Arakelyan et al. (2002), our model could be extended to account\nfor different stages of the angiogenic process. It is also possible to amend the model to\ninclude tumour interaction with the stroma or normal tissue, which might be important\nfor the progression of tumour growth. In addition, we remark that there has been evidence\nof a subpopulation of EPCs that release angiogenic factors (Hur et al., 2004) and that our\nmodel does not include an effect of that kind. We anticipate that the release of angiogenic\nfactors by EPCs once they have been recruited to the tumour site could further enhance\nboth angiogenesis and vasculogenesis in a paracrine and autocrine fashion.\n2764 Stamper et al.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors are grateful to the European Commission under the MCRTN and the EPSRC\nfor financial support to IJS and HMB, respectively.

Hence, we use these values for illustrative purposes.\nThe main bifurcation parameter is the dimensionless ratio 1\/d\u22170 = \u03b2\/d0. The maxi-\nmum tumour growth rate, \u03b2 , is related to a corresponding potential doubling time, Tpot\n(Tpot is defined as the time it would take for a tumour to double in size if there were no\ncell loss), by the relation Tpot = ln 2\/\u03b2 . Assuming that \u03b2 gives rise to a potential doubling\ntime of one day (22 h in Tannock, 1970), we have that \u03b2 \u2248 0.69\/day. The rate of apoptosis\nthen determines the actual doubling time associated with \u03b2 . For example, if d0 = 0.15\u03b2\nthen the doubling time is ln 2\/(\u03b2 \u2212 d0) = 1\/0.85 \u2248 1.18 days and our bifurcation para-\nmeter 1\/d\u22170 \u2248 6.7, while if d0 = 0.8\u03b2 then the doubling time is 5 days and the bifurcation\nparameter 1\/d\u22170 = 1.25.\nModelling the Role of Angiogenesis and Vasculogenesis 2767\nTable B.1 Model variables\nVariable Dimension Description\nC1 ML\u22123 Concentration of TAF in the tumour\nC2 ML\u22123 Concentration of TAF in the blood\nC3 ML\u22123 Concentration of TAF in the bone\nmarrow\nm L3 Tumour volume (cells and interstitium)\nt T Time\nu L3 Vasculogenesis-derived tumour vasculature\nv L3 Total volume of tumour vasculature\nV1 L3 Total tumour tissue volume (cells, interstitium\nvasculature)\nw L3 Angiogenesis-derived tumour vasculature\nx 1 Number of EPCs in the bone marrow\ny 1 Number of EPCs in the blood\nz 1 Number of EPCs in the tumour\nOnce 1\/d\u22170 = \u03b2\/d0 is fixed, \u0393 \u2217 = \u0393 \u03bb determines the outcome of the system (recall\nFig. 3 where there is a stable avascular steady state if 1 < 1\/d0 < \u0393 +1, while the tumour\neither evolves to a vascular steady state or grows exponentially if 1\/d0 \u2265 \u0393 +1). We have\nbeen unable to establish a value of \u0393 and \u03bb. In our simulations we take \u0393 \u2217 = 4, assuming\nthat \u03bb = 0.1 and that neovascularisation is initiated at a vascular density of 0.025 (i.e. a\nvascular space of 2.5% ) equivalent to \u0393 = 40. We note that the vascular space of tumour\ntissue varies considerably, as reviewed in Jain (1988), from 0.4% to 27.5%.\nBy taking the volume of an avascular tumour to correspond to a radius of 1 mm (as-\nsuming that avascular tumours do not grow larger than a diameter of 1\u20132 mm), and by\nassuming that neovascularisation is initiated at a vascular density of 1\/\u0393 = 0.025, we\napproximate the background vasculature, v0, to be 0.025 \u00d7 4\u03c0 \u00d7 13\/3 mm3 \u2248 0.1 mm3.\nThe potential doubling time of ECs in activated endothelium, e.g. due to mechanical in-\njury or tumour growth, is roughly 50 h (Tannock, 1970; Tannock and Hayashi, 1972). This\nvalue is in accordance with Mantzaris et al. (2004) where the EC doubling time during\nangiogenesis was said to be \u201ca few days\u201d. If we assume that a potential doubling time of\n2 days corresponds to a TAF (VEGF) level of 10 ng\/ml, and also choose this as the char-\nacteristic level in the tumour, \u02dcC1 = \u02dcC2\u03b31 = 10 ng\/ml, we have that p\u22174 = p4\u02dcC2\u03b31\u03b2 = 0.5.\nA VEGF level of 10 ng\/ml for most rapid EC proliferation is consistent with experiments\nwhich measured DNA synthesis of HUVECs proliferating in response to VEGF (Soker et\nal., 1997). Furthermore, a VEGF level of 10 ng\/ml is comparable with levels measured\nin some tumours (Kraft et al., 1999).\nIn Song et al. (2005), the percentage of endothelial cells that were apoptotic in\nthe tumour tissue was determined to 1.5%. If we assume that the duration of apopto-\nsis is 3 hours (Thompson et al., 1992), then the rate of cell loss can be estimated to\n0.015\/(3\/24)\/day = 0.12\/day. This gives d\u22174 = d4\/\u03b2 \u2248 0.17.\nThe parameter c corresponding to production of TAF per unit tumour volume per day\nis given in Stoll et al. (2003) to be 7.0 \u00d7 102 pg\/mm3\/day.\nThe decay rate of TAF in the blood, r , can be obtained from the half-life of VEGF\nin blood, T1\/2, which, from Stoll et al. (2003), is approximately 3 min. This gives r \u2248\nln 2\/T1\/2 = 330\/day.\n2768 Stamper et al.\nTable B.2 Model parameters\nParameter Dimension Parameter description\n\u03b2 T \u22121 Maximum tumour growth rate\nc MT\u22121L\u22123 Production rate of TAF per unit tumour volume\nd0 T\u22121 Per capita death rate of tumour volume\nd1 T\u22121 Per capita death rate of EPCs in the bone marrow\nd2 T\u22121 Per capita death\/uptake rate of EPCs in the blood\nd3 T\u22121 Per capita death rate of EPCs in the tumour\nd4 T\u22121 Per capita death rate of angiogenic vasculature\nd5 T\u22121 Per capita death rate of vasculogenic vasculature\n\u03b41 T\u22121 Maximum rate of angiogenic vessel occlusion\n\u03b42 1 Value of m\/v where angiogenic occlusion\nattains half-maximal value\n\u03b43 T\u22121 Maximum rate of vasculogenic vessel occlusion\n\u03b44 1 Value of m\/v where vasculogenic occlusion\nattains half-maximal value\n\u03b31 1 Tumour\/blood partition coefficient\n\u03b33 1 Bone marrow\/blood partition coefficient\n\u0393 1 Value of m\/v above which TAF production\nis active\nk1 T\u22121 Per capita delivery rate of EPCs from the bone\nmarrow to blood\nk2 L3M\u22121T\u22121 Per capita delivery rate of EPCs from the bone\nmarrow to blood per unit TAF\nk3 T\u22121M\u22121 Per capita adherence rate of EPCs per unit TAF\nand unit tumour vasculature\nk4 T\u22121 Per capita alignment rate of EPCs into\nfunctional tumour vasculature\n\u03bb 1 Value of v\/m where tumour growth rate\nattains half-maximal value\n\u03bc L3 Functional vasculature volume per EPC\np1 T\u22121 Constant production rate of EPC in the bone\nmarrow\np2 L3M\u22121T\u22121 Production rate of EPC in the bone marrow\nper unit TAF concentration\np3 L3M\u22121T\u22121 Per capita production rate of EPC at tumour site\nper unit TAF concentration\np4 L3M\u22121T\u22121 Per capita production rate of angiogenic vessels\nper unit TAF\np5 L3M\u22121T\u22121 Per capita production rate of vasculogenic vessels\nper unit TAF\nq1 T\u22121 Blood flow rate to the tumour per unit vasculature\nQ3 L3T\u22121 Blood flow to the bone marrow\nr T\u22121 Decay rate of TAF in the blood\nv0 L3 Initial background vasculature volume\nV2 L3 Volume of blood\nV3 L3 Volume of bone marrow\nThe characteristic value of the concentration of TAF in the blood, \u02dcC2, is, as given in\nStoll et al. (2003), 1 ng\/ml = 10\u221212 g\/mm3.\nModelling the Role of Angiogenesis and Vasculogenesis 2769\nWe take the volume of blood, V2, to be equal to the value of plasma volume, which in\nGerlowski and Jain (1983) is given to be 1.0 \u00d7 103 mm3.\nIn Oku et al. (1998), the blood flow for wild type human melanoma intracere-\nbral xenografts was given as 105 ml\/min\/100 g with a corresponding blood volume\nin the tumour of 1.99 ml\/100 g. From these values, we estimate q1 = 105 ml \u00d7 24 \u00d7\n60\/1.99\/day \u2248 76000\/day.\nWith the above estimates, we obtain that c\u2217 \u2248 0.09, r\u2217 \u2248 43 and p\u02c64 \u2248 0.001.\nIn Stoll et al. (2003), the number of ECs per unit vascular volume was estimated to be\n4.9 \u00d7 105\/mm3. If we assume that the same holds true for EPCs, then we have that \u03bc,\nthe vasculature volume per EPC, is 1\/(4.9 \u00d7 105) \u2248 0.2 \u00d7 10\u22125 mm3. With v0 = 0.1 we\nobtain the scaling factors X = Y = Z = U\/\u03bc = v0\/\u03bc = 0.1\/0.2\/10\u22125 = 50,000.\nIn Hristov et al. (2003), the number of EPCs in blood of healthy individuals is stated to\nbe approximately between 70 to 210 cells\/ml, while in Dome et al. (2006) the number of\nEPCs in healthy individuals was estimated to 345 cells\/ml. Assuming background levels\nof 300 cells\/ml in mice, with a blood volume as above (1.0 ml), we obtain that the (di-\nmensionless) background level of EPCs in the blood as given by (38) should correspond\nto y\/Y = 300\/50000 = 0.006. Thus, we choose k\u22171 , p\u22171 , d\u22172 and d\u22171 to obtain this level.\nWe do not know the background level of EPCs in the bone marrow, but assuming that it\nis higher than in blood, since under normal conditions EPCs reside predominantly in the\nbone marrow (Hattori et al., 2001), we choose k\u22171 < d\u22172 as this guarantees x > y.\nBased on the above estimates (where possible), unless otherwise stated, in the full\nmodel we used the following dimensionless parameter values:\nd\u22171 = 0.1, d\u22172 = 0.4, d\u22173 = 0.25, d\u22174 = 0.17, d\u22175 = 0.17,\n\u03b4\u22171 = 0.15, \u03b4\u22172 = 0.6, \u03b4\u22173 = 0.15, \u03b4\u22174 = 0.6, \u0393 \u2217 = 4,\nk\u22171 = 0.03, k\u02c62 = 0.002, k\u02c63 = 0.0002, k\u22174 = 0.5, (B.1)\np\u22171 = 0.01, p\u02c62 = 0.002, p\u02c63 = 0.002, p\u02c64 = 0.001,\np\u02c65 = 0.001 and r\u2217 = 43.\nTo generate the schematic bifurcation diagram and phase plane for the angiogenesis\nsubmodel, Figs. 3 and 4, we used the following dimensionless parameter values:\nd\u22174 = 3, \u03b4\u22171 = 5, \u03b4\u22172 = 1, \u0393 \u2217 = 4, p\u02c64 = 0.07 and r\u2217 = 4.\n(B.2)\nNote that in the angiogenesis submodel p\u02c62 = k\u02c62 = k\u02c63 = 0 while in the vasculogenesis\nsubmodel p\u02c64 = 0.\nAppendix C Analysis of Eq. (42)\nThe number of physically realistic roots of (42) can be determined as follows. From (46),\nwe notice that all zeros of f (u) are negative, f (u) > 0 if u \u2265 0 (assuming 1\/d0 \u2212 1 > 0\nfor vascular steady states) and that f (u) \u2192 \u221e as u \u2192 \u221e. From (43), it follows that\ndg\ndu\n\u2223\n\u2223\n\u2223\n\u2223\nu=0\n= p4p3k3k2\n(\n1\nd0\n\u2212 1\n)4 5\n\u220f\ni=1\n(\u2212Gi). (C.1)\n2770 Stamper et al.\nSince G3G4 > 0 and G5 < 0, we deduce that dgdu |u=0 < 0, if and only if G1 and G2 are\nof opposite signs. Therefore, if dg\ndu\n|u=0 < 0, then there exists only one positive zero of\ng(u) (G1 or G2). In addition, since g(0) = 0, f (u) > 0 for all u \u2265 0 and the fact that\ng(u) \u2192 \u221e as u \u2192 \u221e and does so faster than the fourth-order function f (u) implies that\nwhen dg\ndu\n|u=0 < 0, there will always exist one and only one positive root, say u\u02c6, of (42).\nHowever, further analysis reveals that this root corresponds to an unrealistic steady state.\nThis is because u\u02c6 > max {G1,G2} and if u > G2 then z < 0 always holds. Similarly, in the\ncase dg\ndu\n|u=0 = 0, we also conclude that only physically unrealistic steady states can exist\n(again z < 0 at the steady states). A necessary condition for physically realistic steady\nstates is therefore dg\ndu\n|u=0 > 0. As above, we conclude that if dgdu |u=0 > 0 and both G1\nand G2 are negative, only physically unrealistic equilibrium points can exist. Therefore,\nonly if G1 and G2 both are positive, so that g(u) has two positive zeros, might there\nbe one or two physically realistic steady states in addition to the physically unrealistic\nsteady state where z < 0. (This will occur whenever the parameters are such that f\u00af \u2265 0 at\nmin {u\u2217 > 0 : f\u00af \u2032|u=u\u2217 = 0}). Hence the sixth-order polynomial has at most two physically\nrealistic solutions.\nReferences\nAghi, M., Chiocca, E.A., 2005.
