INTRODUCTION\nTHE MULTISTAGE collector is a critical component ofvacuum microwave and millimeter-wave devices where\nefficiency is an important parameter, such as traveling-wave\ntube amplifiers in spaceborne and airborne applications, gy-\nrotrons in plasma applications, and klystrons and inductive out-\nput tubes in television transmissions. Therefore, optimization\nof multistage collector performance is essential to maximize\nrecovered power from spent electron beam. Since the inception\nof modern multistage collectors, different techniques have been\nadopted to achieve maximum collector and overall efficiencies\n[1]\u2013[4]. Secondary electrons play a determining role in collec-\ntor performance. Fabrication of electrodes with materials of low\nsecondary electron emission coefficient reduces the effect of\nsecondaries [5]\u2013[8]. A transverse magnetic field may be applied\nin the collector region to reduce backstreaming of reflected\nprimary and secondary electrons. Sometimes, introduction of\nasymmetry in the geometry may be useful to recapture the\nsecondary electrons [9], [10]. Another way of improving mul-\ntistage collector performance is shaping of the electric and\nmagnetic fields inside the collector in such a way that the\nelectrons land on the electrodes perpendicularly. This reduces\ntheir transverse energy and, hence, loss in the form of heat.\nHowever, little has been published on methods of choosing the\ngeometry of the collector electrodes to optimize the collector\nperformance. It is not very efficient to optimize the collector\nperformance manually as many geometrical parameters, e.g.,\nangle, inner diameter, outer diameter, and thickness of each\nManuscript received February 21, 2007; revised May 2, 2007.

Instead, a search algorithm can be used to find the\ncollector geometry for optimum performance. Different tech-\nniques such as random walk, genetic algorithm, and simulated\nannealing have been tried in the past to automate the design\nprocess. The simulated annealing technique was implemented\nin two dimensions to optimize the geometry of an axisymmetric\ncollector, but the feasibility of its fabrication was not consid-\nered [11]. Optimization of multistage collector geometry using\nrandom walk and genetic algorithm was first demonstrated by\nthe authors [12], [13]. The implementation of these techniques\nin a 3-D collector simulation code and the simulated perfor-\nmance of optimized axisymmetric and asymmetric collectors\nare presented here. Any electrostatic code with the capability\nof simulating the electron trajectories can be used as a basis for\nimplementing these techniques for automated optimization.\nII. DEVELOPMENT OF 3-D PACKAGE\nThe mainframe version of Lancaster KOBRA,1 which was\ndeveloped earlier in a European Space Research and Technol-\nogy Centre sponsored project [14], was used as a basis for the\nimplementation of both random walk and genetic algorithms.\nDue to the automated nature of the algorithm, it was necessary\nto make some changes in the package as well as in its preproces-\nsor and postprocessor [13].\nThe option to input the geometry, the mesh information, the\nelectrode potentials, and the boundary conditions through a\ndata file has been created, which helps in changing the shape\nand size of any electrode easily due to parameterization. To\ngenerate the starting conditions of the electron trajectories,\nthe parameters of the spent electron beam, i.e., position and\nvelocity components, have been generated using a large-signal\nmodel. An interface with a 2.5-D model SUNRAY-3D [15] has\nbeen introduced to convert the initial conditions of the electron\ntrajectories into a 3-D format.\nTo implement the optimization algorithms, it is necessary\nto combine the geometry generator, the Poisson solver, the\ntrajectory solver, the preprocessor, the postprocessor, and the\noptimization codes. The present version of the package runs in\nthe UNIX operating system in a batch mode, and it terminates\nonce the user-specified iteration number is reached or the\ntarget collector efficiency is achieved. For each iteration, the\nsimulation time for any collector geometry with 750 000 nodes\nwas nearly 15 min in a 2.8-GHz personal computer with a 2-GB\nrandom access memory. After each cycle, the collector geom-\netry is stored in a parameterized form along with its analysis\nreport.

The collec-\ntor geometry corresponding to the best efficiency achieved so\nfar is stored in a separate file, which can be retrieved in case of\nintentional or accidental stopping during execution.\nIII. OPTIMIZATION USING RANDOM WALK METHOD\nThe simplest random walk algorithm starts from a point,\nfollows a random path, and looks for the object function values\nat different points in a finite search space considering only one\npoint at a time. Several variations of the algorithm are possible\ndepending on the application to a specific problem [16], [17].\nThis algorithm is most effective in cases where the search space\nand the number of possibilities are small.\nA. How It Works\nA basic flowchart for the design optimization package using\nrandom walk approach is shown in Fig. 1. The preprocessor\nuses the geometry and trajectory data to generate a suitable\ninput file for the simulator. The postprocessor computes the\nefficiency of the collector, which acts as the object function\nvalue. If after any iteration the performance is better than the\nbest value achieved so far, then the search operation starts\nagain from this point; otherwise, it starts from the previous\nbest geometry. The decision to choose the point of the next\ncomputation is made by the random walk algorithm. After\nseveral iterations, if no improvement in collector performance\nis observed, the user may start the optimization process again\nfrom the initial starting point along a different path. Otherwise,\nthe whole process will continue until the number of iterations\nspecified by the user.\nA clear advantage of this technique over enumerative\nmethods is that all dimensions of the collector electrodes are\nchanged simultaneously. The detailed flowchart of the random\nwalk section is shown in Fig. 2.\nFig. 2. Detailed flowchart for the random walk section.\nFig. 3. Different dimensions of an electrode of a three-stage collector.\nB. How to Create a New Geometry\nNew collector geometries are created by randomly changing\nthe electrode dimensions (e.g., length, inner diameter, outer di-\nameter, and angle of inclination with the axis) in the intermedi-\nate parameterized data file. The maximum and minimum limits\nof the parameter to be changed (increment or decrement) are\nbased on the sensitivity of any dimension and the feasibility of\nits fabrication. However, changes should be made in very small\nsteps to ensure that the changes in the collector efficiency due\nto changes in the electrode dimensions are small. In general,\nthe most sensitive dimension is changed least. A pseudorandom\nnumber generator produces a number between 0 and 1 for each\nelectrode dimension to be decreased or increased, respectively.\nThe dimensions of the electrodes of a three-stage axisym-\nmetric collector, which are commonly changed to create a new\ngeometry, are shown in Fig. 3. These parameters may vary\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library. Downloaded on December 19, 2008 at 06:44 from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply.\nGHOSH AND CARTER: OPTIMIZATION OF MULTISTAGE DEPRESSED COLLECTORS 2033\ndepending on the shape of an electrode. The complexity of the\nproblem can be understood from the number of dimensions to\nbe changed for a four-stage or a five-stage collector.\nPrecautions are taken while changing the dimensions of the\nelectrodes.\n1) Gap between the electrodes: In multistage collectors,\nit is common to have an electrode that lies inside the\nprevious electrode (in the direction of the interaction\ncircuit). A minimum value for g2 ensures a sufficient gap\nbetween the high-voltage electrodes to avoid sparking,\nand a maximum limit on the gap prevents the electrons\nfrom hitting the high-voltage insulators.\n2) Outer radius: The maximum value of the outer radius\ndepends on the inner radius and electrode thickness.\n3) Inner radius: In the case of a cylindrical electrode, the\ninner radius (d1) should be large enough to maintain a\nreasonable gap (g1) between the electrodes.\n4) Beam hole radius: This dimension should be higher than\nthe beam radius to accommodate the expanded beam. The\nspent beam electrons must not be allowed to strike the\nfront face of the electrode (surface toward the interac-\ntion circuit). Otherwise, the secondaries and the reflected\nprimaries generated here see an accelerating field, which\ncauses them to stream back toward the interaction circuit.\n5) Thickness of the electrodes: The minimum electrode\nthickness should be fixed at a practical value.\n6) Angle of inclination: The minimum and maximum are set\nat some practical values.\nOther than the aforementioned parameters, several other\nparameters, such as the length of different parts of an electrode\nand the angles of the two end planes of the electrodes, may also\nbe changed. The change in the angles of the planes is necessary\nfor the optimization of asymmetric tilted electric field (TEF)\ncollectors. However, for symmetric collectors, these angles are\nalways kept fixed at 90\u25e6 to the axis.\nIV. RESULTS AND VALIDATION OF THE PACKAGE\nIMPLEMENTING RANDOM WALK ALGORITHM\nThe random walk algorithm has been tested by optimizing\nthe design of a four-stage axisymmetric collector and a two-\nstage asymmetric collector. After several trials, it was observed\nthat the present package was capable of achieving a significant\nimprovement in the efficiency for both the collectors.\nA. Axisymmetric Collector\nIn Table I, the efficiencies of a four-stage axisymmetric col-\nlector for different trials are shown, where the initial collector\ngeometry is the same in all cases. Only the results of the best\nfour trials are shown in the table. For the initial geometry shown\nin Fig. 4, the collector efficiency is 70%, considering only\nprimary electrons. The best collector efficiency in each case is\nshown after every 50 iterations. The amount of change in the\ndimensions of the collector electrodes is random in any trial in\neach run. For this reason, the intermediate steps are different,\nand the difference between the optimized efficiencies for all\nfour cases is evident. The best efficiency among all these trials\nTABLE I\nOPTIMIZED COLLECTOR EFFICIENCIES FOR DIFFERENT TRIALS\n(FOUR-STAGE AXISYMMETRIC COLLECTOR)\nFig. 4. Initial geometry of the four-stage collector with 70% efficiency.\nFig. 5. Final geometry of the four-stage collector with 89.2% efficiency.\nis 89.2%. The improvement in the collector efficiency is more\nthan 19 percentage points for the optimized geometry shown\nin Fig. 5. A careful look at the initial geometry shows that\nsome of the trajectories are coming out through the gap between\nthe electrodes and may therefore hit the high-voltage insulators\nand damage them. However, due to the optimization of the gap\nlength between the electrodes, this phenomenon is missing in\nthe optimized collector. If the number of trials is increased, then\nthe efficiency may be increased further by a small amount.\nB. Asymmetric Collector\nA two-stage asymmetric TEF collector has been optimized\nusing the same algorithm. The collector efficiency for the initial\ngeometry is 79%, considering only primary electrons.

Initial geometry of the two-stage TEF collector with 79% efficiency.\nFig. 7. Final geometry of the two-stage TEF collector with 82% efficiency.\nV. OPTIMIZATION USING A GENETIC ALGORITHM\nThe random walk method has major limitations, such as\nthe possibility of being trapped at a local maximum and the\nrequirement of a large number of trials to find the optimized\ngeometry. These can be overcome by a more efficient technique,\nnamely the genetic algorithm [18]\u2013[21]. This method is based\non natural phenomena and the theory of the survival of the\nfittest. It generates a new set of data through natural selection\nand genetics through random choice.\nA. Implementation of the Genetic Algorithm\nA basic flowchart for the automated optimization process\nimplementing the genetic algorithm is similar to Fig. 1 except\nthat the genetic algorithm replaces the random walk algorithm.\nHowever, this method is more complicated than the random\nwalk approach, and it is also more difficult to implement.\nThe detailed flow diagram of the genetic algorithm process is\nshown in Fig. 8. The sequence of events implementing the ge-\nnetic algorithm is described in six steps for better understanding\nof the procedure.\n1) From previous experience or by scaling an existing col-\nlector, a new geometry is created as a preliminary design.\n2) Using a nonrepetitive random number generator, a popu-\nlation of chromosomes (a string of binary digits) of equal\nlength is created in such a way that no two members in\nthe population are the same. A brief description on how\nto choose the size of the population and the length of the\nchromosome is given in the next section.\n3) A set of collectors is produced using the chromosomes\nand the basic geometry. For each collector, the simulator\nis run until a converged solution is achieved.\n4) The efficiency of each collector, which is calculated using\nthe postprocessor, is then used as the object function, or\nfitness value, for the corresponding chromosome. A new\npopulation of collectors is generated from the existing\npopulation through the three main operators: 1) reproduc-\ntion; 2) crossover; and 3) mutation. These three operators\nare discussed in detail in a later section.\n5) The function of the genetic algorithm for this generation\nis complete, and the process is repeated for the next\ngeneration of collectors. The best collector geometry,\ncorresponding to the best efficiency achieved in each\ngeneration, is used as the basic geometry for the next\ngeneration.\n6) Steps 3\u20135 are repeated until the number of generations\n(specified by the user) is reached. If in any generation the\nbest efficiency is not better than the previous best, then\nthe total population is discarded, and a new population is\ncreated from the previous population.\nB. How to Create a New Geometry\nTo introduce diversity in the optimization procedure, the\nsearch is started from a large population; i.e., a large number\nof geometries are created that covers many points in the search\nspace for a possible solution. This also provides a large number\nof alternative paths toward optimization.\nWith a chromosome length of 10, there are 210 =\n1024 points in the search space. The larger the length of the\nchromosome, the larger the number of points it covers in the\nsearch space. In the present problem, each binary bit of a chro-\nmosome corresponds to a simple electrode, which makes the\nchromosome length same as the number of simple electrodes. It\nis worth mentioning here that in the present simulation package,\nthe number of electrodes is not the same as the number of\ncollector stages as the complex electrode geometry is created by\ncombining predefined simple electrodes, as shown in Fig. 9. It is\nalso possible to associate each binary bit with a dimension of an\nelectrode. In that case, the chromosome length will be large.\nTo create a new collector from a basic geometry, the dimen-\nsions of an electrode (e.g. length, angle, inner diameter, and\nouter diameter) are increased if the bit is 1 and decreased if the\nbit is a 0. The changes in the dimensions follow the same logic\nfor the random walk algorithm. Thus, a new population of col-\nlectors corresponding to each member chromosome is formed.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Reproduction, Crossover, and Mutation\nAn example of the three basic operators (reproduction,\ncrossover, and mutation) to create a new population is pre-\nsented here. A typical randomly generated population is shown\nin the second column of Table III, where the size of the\npopulation is 4 and the length of each chromosome is 10.\nA new collector geometry corresponding to each chromo-\nsome is produced from the basic collector shape. The com-\nputed efficiency of each collector is shown in the third\ncolumn.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Restrictions apply.\n2036 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRON DEVICES, VOL. 54, NO. 8, AUGUST 2007\nTABLE III\nTYPICAL REPRODUCTION PROCESS\nTABLE IV\nAFTER REPRODUCTION\nIn the reproduction process, the number of offspring of a\ncollector is produced with a probability proportional to its\nefficiency. The number of offspring generated corresponding to\neach collector is shown in the fourth column. In the first line,\nthe number of offspring is two as the collector with the best effi-\nciency produces the most offspring, and in the second and third\nlines, the number of offspring is one each, whereas the member\nof the population with the worst efficiency dies off. Therefore,\nin Table IV, the first two chromosomes are the same as the\nfirst chromosome in Table III. Similarly, the second and third\nchromosomes in Table III remain the same before and after\nreproduction. They become the third and fourth chromosomes,\nrespectively, in Table IV. The first and second columns of this\ntable show the new string numbers and member chromosomes,\nrespectively. These members are then entered into the mating\npool where the pair of parents is chosen randomly from the\npopulation. In this case, the first and third chromosomes make a\npair, and the second and fourth chromosomes make the second\npair. The new string number and the chromosomes are shown in\nthe third and fourth columns, respectively. It is worth mention-\ning that the size of the population is made a constant even num-\nber deliberately to keep the population size constant throughout\nthe computation. In the natural world, the population size\nchanges, which is a complex phenomenon and difficult to\nimplement in an optimization using a genetic algorithm. More-\nover, an increase in the population number after each iteration\nwill create a huge population after only a few iterations. This\nwill increase the computation time for each trial many fold.\nThe next process is crossover. In this problem, we have used\na single-point crossover, and the probability of crossover is\nalways 1. A random number between \u201c1\u201d and \u201cchromosome\nlength \u2212 1\u201d is used as the point of crossover. All digits between\n\u201c1\u201d and \u201cpoint of crossover+ 1\u201d are swapped between the pair\nof parents to produce two children. The crossover process is\nshown in Table V. In the first case, the crossover point is 6.\nTherefore, the first 7 bits of \u201cParent 1\u201d chromosome are\nswapped with the corresponding bits of \u201cParent 2\u201d chromosome\nto produce \u201cChild 1\u201d and \u201cChild 2\u201d chromosomes, respectively.\nIn a similar way, other child chromosomes are generated. These\nchildren form the new population. The old and new populations\nare shown in Table VI.\nTABLE V\nCROSSOVER\nTABLE VI\nOLD AND NEW POPULATIONS (BEFORE AND AFTER CROSSOVER)\nFig. 10. Improvement in efficiency of a four-stage axisymmetric collector\nversus the number of generations (the starting geometry is the same for\nall trials).\nMutation is carried out when all the chromosomes in a\npopulation are the same. A random number is generated\nbetween \u201c1\u201d and \u201cchromosome length\u201d that determines the\nposition of the bit where mutation is to be done. This position\nis different for each chromosome.\nVI. RESULTS AND VALIDATION OF THE PACKAGE\nIMPLEMENTING GENETIC ALGORITHM\nA package has been developed using the genetic algorithm\nto automate the optimization of the designs of those collectors,\nwhich were earlier used to validate the random walk technique.\nThis package has been tested in a similar way as the random\nwalk package. For the symmetric collector, the population size,\nthe chromosome length, the probability of crossover, and the\nmaximum number of generations are taken to be 8, 12, 1, and\n50, respectively; in the case of the asymmetric collector, these\nvalues are 8, 6, 1, and 50, respectively.\nA. Axisymmetric Collector\nAfter several trials, it was observed that in almost all the tri-\nals, the present package was capable of achieving an efficiency\nof more than 90% for the four-stage axisymmetric collector. In\nFig. 10, the improvement in collector efficiency is plotted after\ndifferent numbers of generations for four different trials to show\nthe intermediate steps toward convergence. The optimization\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library. Downloaded on December 19, 2008 at 06:44 from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply.\nGHOSH AND CARTER: OPTIMIZATION OF MULTISTAGE DEPRESSED COLLECTORS 2037\nFig. 11. Optimized four-stage axisymmetric collector with primary electron\ntrajectories. Efficiency of the collector is nearly 91%.\nfor all trials started from the same collector geometry, and\nthe number of collectors simulated in each generation was the\nsame as the population number. As the initial population in the\ngenetic algorithm is created randomly and is nonrepetitive (each\ntime the package is executed, the initial population is different),\nthe intermediate steps are different, although the optimized\nresults are nearly the same. For any trial, the amount of change\nin a specific dimension in any intermediate step is different. A\nmaximum and a minimum limit have been set for the amount\nto be changed in any dimension in a single step. Any value\nbetween these limits can be chosen randomly to make a change\nin that dimension of the electrode.\nThe geometry of the four-stage collector with the primary\ntrajectories after optimization is shown in Fig. 11. Different\naspects of fabrication and practical issues of the collector, e.g.,\nelectrode thickness and gap between the electrodes, have been\ntaken care of while optimizing its geometry (see Fig. 3). In\nthe present example, the efficiency of the optimized collector\nis nearly 91%, which is an improvement by more than 20\npercentage points from the initial collector geometry. A careful\nlook at the collector geometry in Fig. 5, which is optimized via\nthe random walk algorithm, reveals that a few trajectories are\nhitting at the front face of electrode 3 and electrode 4, which\ncould have traveled a longer path before they are collected.\nThe energies of these electrons are not recovered fully, and\nthis reduces the collector efficiency and may cause excessive\nheating. On the contrary, nearly all the primaries in Fig. 11 are\ncollected on the backs of the electrodes. This will also help\nin recapturing the secondary electrons. Another comparison\nbetween the two figures shows that the length of the collector\nhas been reduced by nearly 30%, and this has reduced both its\nvolume and its weight. This is important for spaceborne and\nairborne applications.\nB. Asymmetric Collector\nTo further check the suitability of the genetic algorithm,\nthe two-stage asymmetric collector was optimized. After a\nnumber of trials, it was observed that the optimized collector\nefficiency is 84% for nearly all the trials. The best collector\nefficiency at intermediate steps for four different trials is plotted\nin Fig. 12. As in the previous example, the starting geometry\nis the same in all four cases. The geometry of the two-stage\nasymmetric collector after optimization is shown in Fig. 13.\nThe improvement in collector efficiency is about 5 percentage\npoints.\nFig. 12. Improvement in efficiency for a two-stage asymmetric collector\nversus the number of generations (the starting geometry is the same for all\ntrials).\nFig. 13. Optimized two-stage asymmetric collector with primary electron\ntrajectories. Efficiency of the collector is nearly 84%.\nFig. 14. Best collector efficiency for each trial showing the repeatability of\nthe results. The curves with dotted lines are the random walk method, and the\nsolid lines are the genetic algorithm.\nVII. COMPARISON\nThe performance of the random walk algorithm is compared\nwith the genetic algorithm on the basis of the simulated results\nof both symmetric and asymmetric collectors. The advantages\nand disadvantages in terms of consistency, computational time,\naccuracy, and implementation are discussed in detail.\nA. Consistency\nThe best collector efficiency achieved through the genetic\nalgorithm and the random walk method for four different trials\nagainst the trial number is plotted in Fig. 14. In the case of\nthe genetic algorithm, the best efficiency for both collectors\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library. Downloaded on December 19, 2008 at 06:44 from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply.\n2038 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRON DEVICES, VOL. 54, NO. 8, AUGUST 2007\nremains nearly the same across all trials, whereas the random\nwalk method is less consistent, although only the best four trials\nare considered.\nB. Computational Time\nThe total number of simulations carried out for both collec-\ntors in each trial using the genetic algorithm is 400 (50 gen-\nerations with eight collector simulations per generation). For\nthe four-stage symmetric collector, the computational time for\neach trial is about 100 h, whereas for the two-stage asymmetric\ncollector, the computational time is about 60 h. In the case of\nthe random walk method, the times for each trial are 125 and\n75 h for the four-stage symmetric and two-stage asymmetric\ncollectors, respectively. In the latter case, only the best four\ntrials are considered for comparison purposes. If, however, the\ntotal central processing unit time includes the time for all trials\n(not just the best four), then the average time for a successful\ntrial using the random walk method will be much higher.\nC. Accuracy\nIt is observed from Fig. 14 that the optimized performance of\nthe best four trials using the random walk method is sometimes\nclose to what is achieved using the genetic algorithm. More\ntrials may be able to improve the performance of the collectors;\nhowever, this will increase the computational time.\nD. Implementation\nThe advantage of the random walk method is its simplicity\nin implementation. However, there is always a possibility of the\nsearch being trapped in a local maximum due to the random\nnature of the algorithm. This can be overcome by changing both\nthe starting point and the search path at different trials. In the\nexample of the four-stage axisymmetric collector, the search\nis trapped in a local maximum after 100 iterations in trial 1\n(see Table I). A better optimization is achieved by changing\nthe path of the optimization in trial 3. Considering several\nother intermediate trials for which the method failed, it can be\nsaid that a large number of trials are necessary to achieve the\noptimized geometry.\nOn the contrary, the genetic algorithm employs a multidirec-\ntional search. It uses the geometry and performance information\nalong with the search path from the chromosomes of each\ngeneration to create the population of a new generation through\nthe natural evolution process. This makes the genetic algorithm\nmore effective than the random walk method. For complex\nproblems where both the number of variables and the search\nspace are large, the genetic algorithm is the best choice if it is\nused efficiently. Previous experience in design and simulation\nof collectors may be helpful in implementing this algorithm for\noptimization purposes. Variations of this algorithm may be tried\nto reduce the time taken to solve complex problems. Each time\nit is executed, the genetic algorithm follows a different path\ntoward the optimization, as the intermediate steps are different\nand the starting population is generated randomly, but the final\noutcome in each case is nearly the same. The repeatability\nfeature of the genetic algorithm makes it a better choice over\nthe random walk method.\nVIII. CONCLUSION\nGenetic algorithm and random walk methods have been\nimplemented using a 3-D collector simulator for the optimiza-\ntion of both axisymmetric and asymmetric collectors. These\ntechniques can be implemented using any similar suitable code.\nThe optimized performances of the best four trials using the\nrandom walk algorithm have been presented. A large number of\ntrials are required to achieve the optimized geometry using this\nalgorithm. On the other hand, repeatability of the results was\nachieved in all the trials of the genetic algorithm. To reduce\nthe total computation time, the optimization of both of these\ncollectors has been carried out without including the secondary\nelectrons. If the effect of secondaries is included, then the\nefficiency is expected to be reduced by a few percent depending\non the material used for the collector electrodes.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank Dr. W.
