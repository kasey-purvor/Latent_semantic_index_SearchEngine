Introduction\nEven with widespread access to (and improvements in) screening techniques and\nthe development of more effective treatments, cancer remains a major cause of\npremature morbidity in the Western world. While cure rates have improved dra-\nmatically for some tumours (e.g. breast and colorectal cancers),20 patient prognosis\nis not consistently good across all cancers (e.g. lung cancer). The reason for this\nremains an open question: is it due to increasing life expectancy, the cumulative\neffect of exposure to carcinogenic compounds, diet or simply more accurate diagno-\nsis resulting from better screening? What is clear, though, is that the vast resources\nbeing invested in cancer biology and drug discovery have not yet translated into\nsignificant improvements in the treatment and eradication of the disease. In order\nto make further progress, clinicians need to understand why one cancer patient\nresponds well to treatment while another, similar patient does not. A key issue\nhere is the scheduling of therapy. In particular, if combinations of drugs are to be\nused, how should they be coordinated? What level of patient-specific information\nis needed to ensure optimisation of individual-based treatment protocols?\nWe contend that mathematics provides a natural framework within which such\nquestions can be studied. Since results can be obtained on a shorter timescale\nthan the corresponding experimental analyses, a wider range of alternatives can be\nexplored.25 Even so, we do not believe that mathematical modelling and simulation\nwill ever replace experimental work. Rather, it will form part of the toolkit available\nto biologists, being used in tandem with experimental work, to suggest the most\npromising directions for future research and, given sufficiently accurate data, to\npredict those patients who are likely to respond to a particular drug or treatment\nprotocol.\nIncreasing numbers of theoreticians are now constructing mathematical models\nthat can be used to predict how the different physical mechanisms that act within\na tumour combine to produce observed phenomena and to determine the response\nof specific tumours to chemotherapy (see Refs. 8, 38, 45 and 48 for reviews). For\nexample, early models developed by Greenspan and others1,28,29,37 to describe the\ndevelopment of multicellular tumour spheroids (MTS) cultured in vitro assume that\ngrowth is regulated by a single, diffusible nutrient (typically oxygen or glucose).\nIn spite of their simplicity, such models reproduce the dynamics of MTS and their\ncharacteristic spatial structure, with fully-developed MTS comprising an outer rim\nof nutrient-rich, rapidly proliferating cells, a central core of nutrient-deficient or\nnecrotic cellular debris and an intermediate annular region containing quiescent or\nnon-proliferating cells.16,30,31 These spatially-structured models have been extended\nto predict the response of early (avascular) and mature (vascularised) tumours to\nAugust 3, 2006 15:9 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00152\nModelling the Response of Vascular Tumours to Chemotherapy 1221\nchemotherapy.33\u201335 Other authors have developed lumped-parameter models, for-\nmulated as systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to study the response\nof specific tumours growing in vivo to treatment7,15,42 and age-structured models\nto predict the response of different tumour cell lines to drugs that target specific\nphases of the cell cycle.9\nThe variety of factors involved in the development of solid tumours stems, to\na large extent, from the fact that \u201ccancer\u201d is a generic term, used to character-\nize a spectrum of disorders that share common features. At this generic level of\ndescription, cancer may be viewed as a cellular disease in which controls that usu-\nally regulate growth and maintain homeostasis are disrupted. Cancer is typically\ninitiated by genetic mutations that lead to enhanced proliferation rates (or reduced\nrates of apoptosis) and the formation of an avascular tumour. Since it receives\nnutrients by diffusion, the size of an avascular tumour is limited to several millime-\nters in diameter. Further growth relies on the tumour producing growth factors,\nincluding vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), that stimulate the ingrowth\nof a new blood supply from the host vasculature via angiogenesis.17,18 Once vascu-\nlarised, the tumour has access to a vast nutrient source and rapid growth ensues.\nFurther, clusters of tumour cells that break away from the primary tumour, on\nentering the vasculature, may be transported to other organs where they estab-\nlish secondary tumours or metastases that further compromise the host. Invasion\nis another key feature of solid tumours whereby contact with the host tissue stim-\nulates the production of enzymes that digest it, liberating space into which the\ntumour cells migrate and\/or proliferate. Thus, cancer is a complex, multiscale pro-\ncess. The spatial scales of interest range from the subcellular level, to the cellular\nand macroscopic (or tissue) levels while the timescales may vary from seconds (or\nless) for signal transduction pathways to months for tumour doubling times.\nIn an attempt to account for its multiscale nature, Alarco\u00b4n and co-workers4,5\nhave formulated a hybrid cellular automaton of vascular tumour growth that\nextends earlier work by Gatenby and co-workers43 and links submodels which\ndescribe processes operating on different spatial scales. Progress through the cell\ncycle and the production of VEGF are incorporated at the subcellular level while\ncell\u2013cell communication and competition for resources are considered at the cellular\nlevel. Finally, transport of nutrients and VEGF, blood flow and vascular adapta-\ntion are included at the macro- or tissue scale (see Fig. 1). Coupling between the\ndifferent submodels is achieved in several ways. For example, local oxygen levels\nwhich are determined at the macroscale influence both progress through the cell\ncycle and VEGF production at the subcellular level. Conversely, the intracellular\nproduction of VEGF modulates vascular adaptation at the macroscale.\nWhile the model of vascular tumour growth described above is undoubtedly\ncomplex, it has the potential to yield many predictions that could stimulate new\nexperimental investigations. One natural avenue that we explore here involves\nusing the model to compare the response of vascular tumours to standard ther-\napies that kill proliferating cells (e.g. doxorubicin and paclitaxel33,42). Equally,\nwe could investigate the response to antiangiogenic compounds (e.g. angiostatin,\nAugust 3, 2006 15:9 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00152\n1222 H. M. Byrne et al.\nFig. 1. Schematic diagram illustrating the structure of our hybrid cellular automaton model.\ncombretastain and endostatin19,40,53) that target the tumour vasculature. Our\nmodelling approach shares several common features with complementary work by\nAnderson and coworkers.36,51 Like them, we base our submodel of vascular adap-\ntation and blood flow on work by Pries et al.46 and view the vessels as distributed\nsources for blood-borne nutrients and drugs. However, Anderson and co-workers\nfocus their simulations on a relatively short timescale following a bolus injection\nand consider how the vascular network influences the predicted distribution of the\ndrug within the tissue. By contrast, we couple blood flow and the tissue dynamics\nand consider longer timescales over which effects associated with the drug\u2019s mode\nof action are discernible. In consequence, we are able to obtain detailed spatio-\ntemporal information about the level of tumour cell kill and the extent of damage\nto healthy tissue in response to different anticancer therapies. For example, when\nusing the model to predict the tumour\u2019s response to drugs that target prolifer-\nating cells, we observe three types of behaviour: the drug is ineffective and the\ntumour continues to grow; the drug is effective and the tumour is eliminated; or,\nspatio-temporal oscillations are observed in which well-oxygenated (and drug-rich)\nregions of high vascular and tumour cell density alternate over time with regions\nof widespread cell death and reduced blood flow.\nThe remainder of the paper is organised as follows. In Sec. 2 we introduce\nour hybrid model of vascular tumour growth. In Sec. 3 we extend the model to\ninvestigate the response of a vascular tumour to treatment with an antiproliferative\nchemotherapeutic agent and discuss the different outcomes that can arise. Finally,\nAugust 3, 2006 15:9 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00152\nModelling the Response of Vascular Tumours to Chemotherapy 1223\nin Sec. 4 we summarise and interpret our results and discuss possible directions\nfor future research. We also discuss the mathematical challenges raised by this\nmodelling approach.\n2. Model Development\nOur multiscale model describes the growth of a tumour located within a region\nof normal, vascularised tissue. It accounts for a variety of inter-related phenom-\nena which operate on different space and time scales. These features include cell\ndivision, the expression of angiogenic factors (e.g. VEGF), competition between\nnormal and cancer cells, blood flow, oxygen transport and vascular adaptation.\nThe model is formulated as a hybrid cellular automata, with different submodels\ndescribing behaviour at the subcellular, cellular and macroscopic (or vascular) levels\n(see Fig. 1). Since the focus of this paper is on the tumour\u2019s response to chemother-\napy, we summarise each submodel below and refer the reader to Refs. 4 and 5 for\nfurther details. We stress that the submodels we describe below simply illustrate\nhow such a multiscale model can be assembled: the framework we present is gen-\neral, with considerable scope for incorporating more realistic (and, hence, complex)\nsubmodels. This raises an important issue, namely whether the level of information\nand detail incorporated at each spatial scale influences the system\u2019s behaviour: this\nwill form the basis of future research.10\n2.1. The vascular network (macroscale)\nWe consider for simplicity a vascular structure which is composed of a regular\nhexagonal network (similar to that in liver tissue). We impose a pressure drop\nacross the vasculature, assuming that blood flows into the idealised \u201ctissue\u201d through\na single inlet vessel and drains through a single outlet vessel. To compute the\nblood flow through each vessel we use the Poiseuille approximation, and, given\nthe initial network configuration (i.e. radii and lengths) we compute the flow rates\nthrough, and pressure drops across, each vessel using Kirchhoff\u2019s laws. We assume\nthat initially all vessels have the same radius, but allow them to undergo structural\nadaptation over time. Following Pries et al.46 we assume that the radius R(t) of a\nvessel evolves over a time period \u2206t as follows:\nR(t + \u2206t)\n= R(t) + R(t)\u2206t\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\nlog\n(\n\u03c4w\n\u03c4(\u03c0)\n)\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nhaemodynamic\nstimulus\n+ km(V ) log\n(\nQ\u02d9ref\nQ\u02d9H\n+ 1\n)\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nmetabolic\nstimulus\n\u2212 ks\ufe38\ufe37\ufe37\ufe38\nshrinking\ntendency\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n.\n(2.1)\nAugust 3, 2006 15:9 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00152\n1224 H. M. Byrne et al.\nIn Eq. (2.1) Q\u02d9 is the flow rate, Q\u02d9ref , km and ks are constants, H is the haematocrit\n(red blood cell volume), \u03c4w = R\u2206\u03c0\/L is the wall shear stress acting on a vessel\nof length L and \u03c0 is the transmural pressure. The magnitude of the corresponding\n\u201cset point\u201d value of the wall shear stress, \u03c4(\u03c0), is obtained from an empirical fit\nto experimental data. Thus the second term on the right-hand side of Eq. (2.1)\nrepresents the response to haemodynamic stimuli. The third term describes the\nmetabolic stimulus which we assume increases as the haematocrit decreases. Cou-\npling to the subcellular level is achieved by assuming that km = km(V ) where\nV denotes the local, extracellular VEGF concentration (see Eq. (2.3) below). We\naccount for the pro-angiogenic impact of VEGF by assuming that km(V ) is an\nincreasing, saturating function, of the form:\nkm(V ) = k0m\n(\n1 + kVm\nV\nV0 + V\n)\n,\nfor constants k0m, k\nV\nm and V0. Finally, the constant ks represents the so-called shrink-\ning tendency and is included so that, in the absence of mechanical and metabolic\nstimuli, the vessel will atrophy. Pries et al. found that a third stimulus was required\nfor efficient structural adaptation.46 We justify omitting this phenomenon from our\nmodel on the basis that tumour vasculature adapts less efficiently than normal\nvasculature.\nOnce Eq. (2.1) has been used to update each vessel radius, the associated blood\nflow and haematocrit can be determined. When updating the blood flow, we use\na complex function of H and R which was determined empirically in Ref. 46 to\ndescribe blood viscosity. When updating the haematocrit, we assume that at branch\npoints H splits in a manner which is proportional to the flow velocity in each\ndaughter vessel.21\n2.2. The diffusible chemicals (macroscale)\nCoupling between the vascular, cellular and subcellular scales is effected by\nthe diffusive transport of oxygen and VEGF, under the assumption that oxy-\ngen is the single, growth-rate limiting nutrient. We calculate their respective\ndistributions within the tissue by solving appropriate reaction-diffusion equa-\ntions and imposing zero-flux boundary conditions. We justify adopting the\nusual quasi-steady approximation in these equations on the grounds that the\ntimescales for oxygen and VEGF diffusion are much shorter than the tumour\ndoubling time which is the timescale of interest (minutes and weeks or months,\nrespectively).\nWe denote by P the oxygen concentration and treat the cells as sinks and the\nvessels as sources of oxygen so that the relevant diffusion equation can be written:\n0 = DP\u22072P + hP (Pvess \u2212 P )\u2212 \u03bbcellP. (2.2)\nAugust 3, 2006 15:9 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00152\nModelling the Response of Vascular Tumours to Chemotherapy 1225\nIn (2.2), DP denotes the assumed constant oxygen diffusion coefficient, hP is the\nrate at which oxygen is transported across the vessel wall (hP is only nonzero where\nvessels are located), Pvess = Pvess(H) is the oxygen concentration associated with a\nhaematocrit H (this is determined from the vascular problem). Finally, \u03bbcell denotes\nthe assumed constant rate at which cells consume oxygen, with different values for\nnormal and cancerous cells.\nThe local VEGF profile is calculated in a similar manner, except that cells now\nact as sources of VEGF and vessels as sinks. If we further assume that VEGF is\nrapidly eliminated from the vasculature (so that its concentration there is zero) and\ndenote by \u03bbV its natural half-life, then V satisfies\n0 = DV\u22072V \u2212 hV V + \u03b3cell \u2212 \u03bbV V. (2.3)\nIn (2.3), DV denotes the assumed constant diffusion coefficient of VEGF and hV the\nrate at which VEGF crosses vessel walls. Finally, \u03b3cell represents the rate at which\nsites occupied by cells release their intracellular stores of VEGF to the extracellular\nenvironment (this occurs only when the internal levels of VEGF exceed a threshold\nvalue). As with \u03bbcell in Eq. (2.2), \u03b3cell differs between normal and cancerous cells.\nWe note that Eqs. (2.2) and (2.3) for P and V above differ from those used in\nRefs. 4 and 5. There the vessels were treated as boundaries and exchange with the\nvasculature was incorporated as a boundary condition rather than a distributed\nsource term. With a hexagonal network of vessels, this meant that oxygen and\nVEGF were confined to hexagonal regions of the tissue. The simulations presented\nbelow show how the modified equations resolve the physically unrealistic artefact\nof the earlier simulations and allow the diffusible chemicals to spread more widely\nthrough the tissue. As a result of our new treatment of VEGF, we observe spatio-\ntemporal oscillations in the tissue composition when the adaptation of the vascu-\nlature is regulated by VEGF (see Fig. 5).\n2.3. The cellular level\nThe dynamics of the cell colony is modelled using a two-dimensional cellular\nautomaton, with N \u00d7 N automaton elements or cells.39 Each element is charac-\nterised by a state vector, whose components correspond to features of interest.\nThese include: (i) occupation status (whether an element is occupied by a normal\ncell, a cancer cell, an empty space or a vessel), (ii) cell status (whether the cell is in\na proliferative or quiescent state), (iii) the local oxygen concentration, and (iv) the\nintracellular levels of VEGF, p53 and cell\u2013cycle proteins (see Sec. 2.4). The state\nvector evolves according to prescribed local rules that update a given element on\nthe basis of its own state and those of its neighbours at the previous time step.2\nThese rules were inspired by generic features of tumour growth, such as the ability\nof cancer cells to elude the control mechanisms which maintain stasis in normal tis-\nsues. They can also manipulate their local environment, providing themselves with\nbetter conditions for growth and, eventually, for invasion of the host organism.24\nAugust 3, 2006 15:9 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00152\n1226 H. M. Byrne et al.\nAdditionally, we endow the cancer cells with the ability to survive exposure to\nhypoxia for longer than their normal counterparts.\nOn each timestep the elements of the cellular automaton are updated sequen-\ntially. If a particular element is occupied by a cell, we update its internal dynamics\n(cell cycle proteins, VEGF and p53 levels \u2014 see Sec. 2.4). If a cell is ready to divide,\nthe daughter cell is placed in the adjacent cell with the largest oxygen concentra-\ntion. If there is no empty site, the cell fails to divide and dies. The mechanism for\ncell death or apoptosis differs between normal and cancer cells. In normal cells, if\nthe intracellular level of p53 exceeds a threshold value (which depends on the cel-\nlular composition of its nearest neighbours), then the cell dies. By contrast, under\nlow oxygen, cancer cells become quiescent, suspending most cell functions, includ-\ning proliferation. On entering this state, a clock is started. It is incremented by\nunit steps for each timestep that the cell remains quiescent. If the clock reaches a\nthreshold value then the cell dies. However, if the oxygen level increases above the\nthreshold for cancer cell quiescence then the cell recommences cycling and its clock\nis reset to zero.\n2.4. The subcellular level\nWe formulate systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to describe the\nevolution of the chemicals that control the subcellular processes of interest. These\ninclude progress through the cell cycle, VEGF and p53 expression.\nThe cell cycle is regulated by complex interactions between a large number of\nproteins, the key components being the families of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs)\nand the cyclins. The activity of cyc-CDK complexes is low during G1 and becomes\nhigh after transition. In addition, activities of anaphase protein complex (APC)\nand the protein Cdh1 are high in G1 but become low after the G1\/S transition.\nFor simplicity, we base our work on the model of Tyson and Novak,54 which cap-\ntures the essential features of the cell cycle and can be written in the following\nform:\ndx\ndt\n=\n(k\u20323 + k\u2032\u20323A)(1 \u2212 x)\nJ3 + 1\u2212 x \u2212\nk4myx\nJ4 + x\n, (2.4)\ndy\ndt\n= k1 \u2212 (k\u20322 + k\u2032\u20322x)y, (2.5)\ndm\ndt\n= \u00b5m\n(\n1\u2212 m\nm\u2217\n)\n, (2.6)\nwhere x \u2261 [Cdh1] is the concentration of active Cdh1\/APC complexes, y \u2261 [Cyc]\nis the concentration of cyclin-CDK complexes and m is the mass of the cell. The\nparameters ki (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) and Ji (i = 3, 4) are positive constants and A represents\na generic activator. In Eq. (2.6), \u00b5 is the cell growth rate and m\u2217 is the mass of an\nadult cell.\nEquations (2.4)\u2013(2.6) can exhibit mono- and bi-stability, with the cell mass m\nas a bifurcation parameter. For low values of m there is a single stable steady\nAugust 3, 2006 15:9 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00152\nModelling the Response of Vascular Tumours to Chemotherapy 1227\nstate with a high value of x and a low value of y \u2014 this corresponds to G1. As m\nincreases, the system becomes bistable and a new stable steady state characterised\nby a high value of y and a low value of x emerges. For a critical value of m the\nlatter becomes the only stable steady state and the system switches to this state,\ncorresponding to the S phase. After the cell divides, m decreases, and the system\nis re-set to the \u201cG1 phase steady state\u201d.\nGuided by experimental results presented in Ref. 22 and the hypothesis that\nunder hypoxia expression of the regulatory protein p27 increases,27 we generalise\nEqs. (2.4)\u2013(2.6) and study the (non-dimensionalised) model (see Ref. 3 for full\ndetails):\ndx\nd\u03c4\n=\n(1 + b3u)(1\u2212 x)\nJ3 + 1\u2212 x \u2212\nb4mxy\nJ4 + x\n, (2.7)\ndy\nd\u03c4\n= a4 \u2212 (a1 + a2x + a3z)y, (2.8)\ndm\nd\u03c4\n= \u03b7m\n(\n1\u2212 m\nm\u2217\n)\n, (2.9)\ndz\nd\u03c4\n= \u03c7(m)\u2212 c2 P\nB + P\nz, (2.10)\ndu\nd\u03c4\n= d1 \u2212 (d2 + d1y)u, (2.11)\nwhere now P is the oxygen tension (see Eq. (2.2)), z is the p27 concentration and\nu is the concentration of phosphorylated retinoblastoma (RB). In Eqs. (2.8)\u2013(2.11)\nwe assume that normal and cancer cells differ only in the rates at which they\nproduce p27. For normal cells, p27 expression is regulated by cell size and we fix\n\u03c7(m) = cn1 (1\u2212 mm\u2217 ). For cancerous cells, this size-regulation is lost and \u03c7(m) = ct1.\nTo account for the lower levels of p27 observed in cancer cells compared to normal\ncells44 we further assume that the maximum rate of p27 synthesis in normal cells\nexceeds that in cancer cells (i.e. cn1 > c\nt\n1).\nEquation (2.10) renders explicit how our cell cycle model is coupled to the tissue\nlevel by the oxygen concentration. As we now explain, the other intracellular pro-\ncesses of interest (i.e. VEGF production and apoptosis) are also influenced by P . In\nnormal and cancer cells hypoxia stimulates the expression of VEGF and the protein\np53. In normal cells p53 stimulates apoptosis and may inhibit VEGF production.49\nIn cancer cells mutations in p53 are common and the protein may upregulate VEGF\nproduction and\/or prevent apoptosis.\nWe denote by p and q the concentrations of p53 and VEGF within a given cell\nand assume that their evolution is modulated by P in the following manner:\ndp\ndt\n= k7 \u2212 k\n\u2032\n7P\nC + P\np, (2.12)\ndq\ndt\n= \u03be(p, q)\u2212 k\n\u2032\n8P\nD + P\nq, (2.13)\nAugust 3, 2006 15:9 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00152\n1228 H.

Thus VEGF expression increases under hypoxia.\nFurther p53 increases VEGF production in cancer cells and decreases it in normal\ncells. The intracellular levels of p and q are assigned to the automaton state vector\n(see Sec. 2.3).\n2.5. Numerical algorithm\nWhen performing simulations, the following algorithm is used on each timestep:\n(1) Update the vascular network using the structural adaptation rules;\n(2) Calculate the blood flow and haematocrit at all points within the vascular\nnetwork;\n(3) Update the oxygen and VEGF profiles by solving the relevant boundary value\nproblems;\n(4) Update the elements of the cellular automaton, and the intracellular variables\nassociated with each non-empty element according to whether it is occupied by\na normal or cancerous cell.\nFurther details and a discussion of the parameter values can be found in Ref. 5.\n2.6. Simulations\nFigures 2\u20134 show how the spatial composition of the tissue changes over time while\nFig. 5 summarises the dynamics of the tumour cells. As stated in Sec. 2.1 there\nis a single inlet (outlet) to the vasculature located in the bottom left (top right)\nhand corner of the tissue. As a result, the incoming haematocrit becomes diluted\nas it passes through the hexagonal lattice. This creates a heterogeneous oxygen\ndistribution across the domain, with oxygen levels being highest near the inlet and\noutlet. Over time, the tumour cells proliferate and spread through the tissue towards\nthe oxygen-rich regions. As the number of tumour cells increases, their demand for\noxygen outstrips that available from the vasculature, leading to the formation of\nquiescent cells. These cells produce VEGF which diffuses through the tissue (see\nEq. (2.3) and Figs. 3 and 4), stimulating vessel adaptation (see Eq. (2.1)) and\nbiasing blood flow towards low oxygen regions. If the vasculature does not adapt\nto the VEGF stimulus quickly enough then the quiescent cells die. VEGF levels\nalso decline and blood flow to the remaining tumour cells rises, enabling them\nto increase in number until their demand for oxygen exceeds that being supplied,\nand so the cycle repeats, with pronounced oscillations in the number of quiescent\ncells (see Fig. 5). In order to highlight the key role played by VEGF in creating\nthese oscillations, also presented in Fig. 5 are the results of a simulation which was\nAugust 3, 2006 15:9 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00152\nModelling the Response of Vascular Tumours to Chemotherapy 1229\nEmpty\nNormal\nCancer\nQuiescient\nVascular\nCells i=0 Oxygen\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\n0.05\n0.06\n0.07\n0.08\nVEGF\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nx 103 Radii & Haematocrit\nFig. 2.

We note that the seeded\ntumour is surrounded by a number of empty sites in which it may locate its progeny. From the\nplots on the right-hand side we observe that the oxygen is distributed nonuniformly across the\ndomain, with the highest levels occurring near the vessel inlet (bottom left corner) and the outlet\n(top right corner) and corresponding to regions where the haematocrit is largest. Since there are\nno quiescent cells, there is no VEGF present.

The profiles on\nthe right hand side show that the VEGF has caused remodelling of the vasculature, with blood\nflow and oxygen supply (haematocrit) being directed primarily towards the tumour mass.\nidentical in all aspects except that vascular adaptation was independent of VEGF\n(kVm = 0 in Eq. (2.1)). In both cases, the tumours grow to similar sizes. However,\nwhen vascular adaptation is independent of VEGF, the evolution is monotonic, the\noscillations in the cell populations disappear and the number of quiescent cells is\nconsistently much lower. These results are new and show how coupling between the\ndifferent spatial scales can effect not only the tumour\u2019s growth dynamics but also\nits spatial composition, i.e. the proportion of proliferating and quiescent cells that\nit contains.\n3. Chemotherapy\nWe now investigate how the dynamics of the normal and cancer cells change when\na chemotherapeutic drug is introduced. We assume that the drug is continuously\nadministered to the vessels and, hence, that its concentration at the inlet vessel is\nconstant. We calculate the drug concentration \u03b8vess within the vascular network in\na manner similar to that used to determine the haematocrit, H (see Sec. 2.1). In\nparticular, we assume that the drug is advected with the blood and is partitioned\nat branch points such that the amount of drug entering the daughter vessels is\nproportional to their respective flow velocities. As with the oxygen, we view the\nvessels as distributed sources of drug and assume that, once the drug leaves the\nvessels, it diffuses through the tissue and is taken up by the normal and healthy\ncells.\nAugust 3, 2006 15:9 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00152\nModelling the Response of Vascular Tumours to Chemotherapy 1231\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200\n0\n500\n1000 Proliferating tumour cells\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\nN\num\nbe\nr o\nf c\nel\nls Quiescent tumour cells\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200\n0\n500\n1000\nTime, t\nTotal tumour cells\nFig. 5. Series of curves showing how, for the simulations presented in Figs. 2\u20134, the numbers of\nproliferating (upper panel), quiescent tumour cells (middle panel) and total number of tumour\ncells (lower panel) change over time. While there is a fairly steady increase in the number of\nproliferating cells, the dynamics of the quiescent cells are more complex, initially undergoing\noscillations of increasing amplitude. For t > 80, the tumour is sufficiently large that the quiescent\ncells are never eliminated: quiescent cells that die are replaced by proliferating cells that become\nquiescent. The dot-dashed lines show the evolution of a tumour which is identical in all respects\nexcept that its vasculature is not regulated by VEGF (so that kVm = 0 in Eq. (2.1)). While in both\ncases the tumour reaches a similar equilibrium size, when vascular adaptation is independent of\nVEGF the oscillations in the cell populations disappear and the number of quiescent cells is much\nlower.\nGuided by Eq. (2.2) and denoting by \u03b8 the drug concentration in the tissue,\non each timestep we solve the following diffusion equation, with no-flux boundary\nconditions, to determine \u03b8:\n0 = D\u03b8\u22072\u03b8 + h\u03b8(\u03b8vess \u2212 \u03b8)\u2212 \u03bbdrug\u03b8. (3.1)\nIn (3.1), D\u03b8 denotes the assumed constant diffusion coefficient of the drug, h\u03b8 the\nrate at which it is transported across the vessel wall and \u03bbdrug the assumed constant\nrate at which cells absorb the drug (we assume that \u03bbdrug is the same for normal\nand cancerous cells). We remark that natural decay of the drug has been assumed\nto be dominated by its uptake by the normal and cancer cells (for simplicity, only):\nit would be straightforward to extend the model to account for drug decay also.\nHaving determined \u03b8vess and \u03b8, it remains to specify the drug\u2019s mode of action.\nUltimately, we hope to tailor our model to specific drugs according to the stage(s)\nof the cell cycle at which they act. However, for simplicity, here we assume that the\ndrug works in the following manner. When a cell attempts to divide, if the local\ndrug concentration exceeds a threshold value, then the cell fails to divide and is\nitself killed.\nAugust 3, 2006 15:9 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00152\n1232 H. M.

Series of plots showing how the tissue presented in Fig. 2 responds when an anti-\nproliferative drug is continuously administered through the vasculature. For comparison with\nFig. 3, the profiles are plotted at time t = 30 (dimensionless time units), with the drug distri-\nbution replacing the VEGF profile. The drug levels are highest near the inlet and outlet to the\nvasculature and this causes extensive killing of normal cells, leaving the tumour relatively free of\ndamage.\nWith these changes we are able to use our model to test the response of our vir-\ntual tumour to different drugs. Repeated simulations suggest that, when the drug is\nused, three qualitatively different types of behaviour emerge: the drug is ineffective\nand the tumour continues to colonise the tissue (since the dynamics here are similar\nto those without the drug, no results are presented), the tumour is reduced in size,\nbut not completely eliminated (see Figs. 6\u20138), or the drug successfully eliminates\nthe tumour (Figs. 9\u201311).\nThe simulation presented in Figs. 6\u20138 corresponds to a case for which the drug\nfails to eliminate completely the tumour. It reduces the mean size of the tumour\nat long times and alters its composition so that it comprises predominantly pro-\nliferating cells. Further the spatio-temporal oscillations observed in the absence of\ntreatment (h\u03b8 = 0) become more pronounced (see Fig. 12, h\u03b8 = 90) as a result of\nadditional cell death. In more detail, the quiescent tumour cells produce VEGF,\nstimulating enhanced blood flow and, hence, increased drug delivery. The drug\ncauses the tumour to shrink but, as oxygen consumption is reduced, the number of\nquiescent cells falls and, in consequence, blood flow and drug delivery decline. The\ntumour then proliferates into empty regions where the normal cells have been killed\nby the drug and where oxygen levels are high. The formation of quiescent regions\nwithin the tumour mass then stimulates vascular remodelling, redirecting oxygen\nand drug to these regions (compare Figs. 6\u20138). The simulation also provides some\nindication of the degree of damage sustained by the healthy cells. We note that\ncells located near the inlet and outlet are killed since drug levels are highest there.\nAugust 3, 2006 15:9 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00152\nModelling the Response of Vascular Tumours to Chemotherapy 1233\nEmpty\nNormal\nCancer\nQuiescient\nVascular\nCells i=112 Oxygen\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n0.1\nDrug\n0.2\n0.25\n0.3\n0.35\n0.4\n0.45\n0.5\n0.55\n0.6\nRadii & Haematocrit\nFig. 7.

In addition to causing more widespread damage to\nthe normal cells, at early times the increased drug levels also reduce the number\nof tumour cells (compare Figs. 6 and 9). At later times, drug levels remain high,\nAugust 3, 2006 15:9 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00152\n1236 H. M. Byrne et al.\npreventing the tumour from spreading through the tissue (compare Figs. 7 and 10)\nand eventually eliminating it (compare Figs. 8 and 11). We remark that fluctuations\nin VEGF cause vessel remodelling, fluctuations in the local blood flow and, hence,\nchanges in the oxygen and drug levels. These allow the tumour to enjoy periods of\nrecovery before it is eliminated (see Fig. 12). We also note that while some normal\ncells are killed by the drug, they are not completely destroyed by the drug when\nthe tumour is eliminated (the drug elicits a stronger response in the tumour cells\nsince they proliferate more rapidly than the normal cells). Thus if treatment were\nhalted at t = 90 then the healthy cells would eventually repopulate the tissue.\nFigure 12 summarises the tumour\u2019s dynamics for the three simulations presented\nin Figs. 2\u20134 (h\u03b8 = 0), 6\u20138 (h\u03b8 = 90) and 9\u201311 (h\u03b8 = 100). As h\u03b8 increases, and\nmore drug is delivered, oscillations in the number of proliferating cells become more\nmarked. For sufficiently large values of h\u03b8 (here h\u03b8 \u2265 100) the drug eventually\neliminates the tumour.\n4. Conclusions\nWe have shown how a multiscale model can be used to study the response of a\nvascular tumour to continuous infusion with chemotherapy.We have used a modified\nversion of a hybrid cellular automaton model that was originally developed by\nAlarco\u00b4n et al.4,5 and which incorporates coupling between phenomena occurring on\ndifferent spatial scales. By treating the vessels as continuous sources (or sinks) of\noxygen and drug (or VEGF), physically unrealistic artefacts of the earlier models\nhave now been removed and the diffusible species are able to spread across the\nentire tissue region. As a result, we observe spatio-temporal oscillations in the tissue\ncomposition when vascular adaptation is regulated by VEGF (see Fig. 5), a feature\nthat, to our knowledge, has not been reported previously in similar mathematical\nmodels of vascular tumour growth.\nMcDougall et al.36 used a similar model of vascular adaptation and blood flow to\nstudy the distribution of blood-borne chemotherapy. However, they did not consider\nthe cytotoxic effect of the drug on the underlying tissue. By contrast, we predict\nthe cell kill that results when a particular drug is used. Further, since in our model\nthere is coupling between the subcellular, cellular and macro- or vascular scales, we\nare also able to determine the (indirect) impact that changes in the cellular com-\nposition of the tissue have on the vasculature (this being relevant when a standard\nchemotherapeutic drug is administered) and vice versa (this being relevant when\nan antiangiogenic drug is used).\nOur simulations show that when a drug that targets proliferating cells (tumour\nand normal) is continuously administered via the vasculature, the outcome depends\non the choice of parameter values and takes three possible forms: the tumour is\nsuccessfully eliminated by the drug; the tumour\u2019s invasion of the healthy tissue\ncontinues; or, the tumour grows to a finite size, with more pronounced spatio-\ntemporal oscillations in its composition.\nAugust 3, 2006 15:9 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00152\nModelling the Response of Vascular Tumours to Chemotherapy 1237\nWhile the results we obtain are qualitatively realistic, there are many avenues\nfor further investigation. These stem, to a large extent, from the fact that the sub-\nmodels we have employed are rather simplistic. Since the framework we present\nis general (see Fig. 1), there is considerable scope for incorporating more realistic\nsubmodels and establishing conditions under which the more complex models yield\ndifferent qualitative behaviour. This is a key issue facing researchers developing\nmultiscale models.10 For example, we could implement a more detailed cell cycle\nmodel and use it to study the impact of drugs that act at one or more of the phases\nof the cell cycle or those which target the tumour\u2019s vasculature. Conversely, we\ncould introduce a simpler model in which decisions about cell division are based\nsolely on a cell\u2019s local environment. While these investigations may appear rather\ntheoretical in nature, comparing the results that they generate should provide use-\nful insight into the level of detail that is needed to model accurately the system\u2019s\nresponse to therapy. In particular, we anticipate that the degree of detail needed\nwill depend on a particular drug\u2019s mode of action (e.g. whether it is cell-cycle spe-\ncific). Equally, following Gatenby et al.,23,24,50 we could include a more detailed\ndescription of cellular metabolism and investigate the role of pH on tumour inva-\nsion. Other important mechanisms that are the subject of ongoing work include a\nmore detailed description of angiogenesis (with explicit treatment of capillary tip\nformation and tip-to-tip anastomosis), the impact of mechanical effects (e.g. con-\ntact inhibition of cell proliferation13,32 and the collapse of immature vessels under\npressure12) and cell movement.6\nWe could also adapt the model to compare the tumour\/tissue response to differ-\nent drug delivery protocols, including combination treatments and possibly involv-\ning novel types of gene therapy that target hypoxic regions41 and allowing for\ntumour cell heterogeneity, with some subclonal populations being resistant to ther-\napy. The simulations we presented focused on the tumour\u2019s response to continuous\ninfusion with a chemotherapeutic drug but also highlighted the extensive damage\nto normal cells that is an inevitable consequence of such highly toxic compounds.\nIn practice these side-effects mean that the drugs are administered as a series of\nboluses, rather than by continuous infusion. Our model could easily be adapted to\nstudy this more realistic situation. Other interesting directions for future research\ninvolve using kinetic theory and statistical mechanics in place of cellular automata\nto simulate cell dynamics11 and incorporating concepts from evolutionary game the-\nory to study carcinogenesis.26 In the latter case random genetic mutations introduce\nheterogeneity into the cell population, the fitness of the different subpopulations\nbeing influenced by intra- and extra-cellular factors. As a result, we could inves-\ntigate how tumours are initiated and whether environmental conditions select for\nparticular genetic mutations.\nOne weakness of our multiscale model that stems from its complexity is the\nreliance on numerical simulations to obtain solutions. This may limit the applica-\nbility of the model. For example, it may be infeasible to run large numbers of simu-\nlations on large spatial domains. However, by validating the model against detailed\nAugust 3, 2006 15:9 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00152\n1238 H. M. Byrne et al.\nspatio-temporal data from, for example, mouse chamber assays,14 it should be pos-\nsible to extract from the simulations averaged time activity curves, similar to those\npresented in Figs. 5 and 12, showing how the numbers of tumour cells (proliferating\nand quiescent) and normal cells, together with the mean vascular density, evolve\nover time. These curves could then be fit to lumped parameter models, similar to\nthose being developed by Arakelyan et al.,7 before the (indirectly validated) ODE\nmodels are used to study less detailed data from large scale clinical trials. In doing\nthis, it will of course be necessary to specialise the model to describe specific tumour\ntypes47,52 and particular drugs.15,33,42 This is the subject of ongoing work.\nOne of the major challenges facing researchers in the Life Sciences is understand-\ning how processes interact on different length and time scales. Verbal reasoning is\nnot sufficient to compute the outcome of such complex interactions and we must\ntherefore use computational modelling. However, if we were to express every known\nreaction computationally, we would arrive at a model that was computationally\nintractable and impossible to parametrise. Therefore we must use coarse-graining\nand herein lies the mathematical challenge. For example, in the modelling described\nin this paper we used for the cell cycle a very simple model that captured the essence\nof certain aspects of the cell cycle (which has been modelled using up to 60 equa-\ntions). Can we make similar simplifications for other biochemical networks? Can\nwe be certain that we have not lost key information by making this simplification?\nThat is, how robust are the subsequent models? Is it possible that we could describe\nthe framework we presented at a continuum level which would capture the key fea-\ntures of this model yet allow us more easily to scale up to three spatial dimensions\nand to larger, more realistic, sizes of tissue? It may well be that we need a suite of\nmodels depending on what question that we can answer.\nAlthough there have been some attempts to tackle aspects of the issues men-\ntioned above, such as using Boolean switches to understand complex biochemical\nnetworks (instead of the more complicated modelling approach of using coupled\nordinary differential equations), there has been no systematic approach and these\nare all open questions that will stimulate theoreticians and experimentalists for\nmany years to come.\nAcknowledgments\nT.A. thanks the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council for financial\nsupport under grant GR\/509067.
