Sports Technology, 3(1): 43-51. DOI:10.1080\/19346190.2010.504273 \n \n1 Introduction \nSynthetic turf surfaces comprise tufted or knitted cut-pile carpets or woven or needle-\npunched (loop) carpets of synthetic fibres of various polymers (commonly polypropylene and \npolyethylene but historically polyamide) overlying a constructed base designed to provide a \nstable, level, free-draining, load supporting sub-base for the carpet.  The majority of surfaces \nhave a sand or rubber (or both) infill of the carpet to optimise mechanical behaviour for \nspecified ball-surface and player-surface interactions.  Further optimisation is achieved with \nsub-carpet \u2018shock-pads\u2019 \u2013 layers of elastic rubber beneath the carpet.  The most common \nsynthetic turf surface in the UK remains the \u2018Second Generation\u2019 (2G) sand-filled, short (ca. \n25 mm) polypropylene fibre carpet, over a stone, tar-macadam, rubber shock-pad sub-base \n(Figure 1).  2G surfaces are a compromise surface for field hockey, bowls, football (soccer), \ntennis and multi-use games areas.  A \u2018Third Generation\u2019 of longer-pile surfaces, in-filled with \nsand and rubber are becoming increasingly popular as they are more suited to football and \nrugby.  There is increasing variation in surface design specification, with a range of fibre \nmaterials, fibre lengths, sub-base construction profiles, shock pads and infill materials as \nmanufacturers and installers aim to reduce costs, increase durability and improve surface \nperformance against international sports governing body criteria such as those of FIFA \n(2009), FIH (2008) and the IRB (2009). \nSynthetic turf surfaces are more durable over a fixed time period than natural turf and can \ntherefore increase the intensity of sport use per unit area.  Maintenance requirements for \nsynthetic turf are different from natural turf but synthetic turf surfaces should not be \nconsidered maintenance-free.  Abraded particles from equipment such as footwear and \nhockey sticks, litter, air-borne contamination and soil and plant matter will accumulate in the \nsurface and over time will be washed into the infill material reducing infiltration rate, causing \nthe pitch to flood and creating the ideal environment for moss infestation (McLeod and \nJames, 2007).  McLeod and James (2008) reported a survey of 11, well maintained UK 2G \nsand-filled surfaces, used for 22 to 68 hours per week, in which a combined measure of these \ninfill contamination types ranged from 2.1 to 9.1% by mass, increasing to 20% in problem \nareas (McLeod and James, 2007).  They demonstrated in a laboratory study that infiltration \nrate of a 2G carpet reduced from 150 mm\/h to 50 mm\/h at 10% contamination of the infill.  \nThat study did not consider the effect of contamination on the playing performance of the \nsurface, however.  Maintenance aims to minimise contamination accumulation with frequent \nbrushing using powered rotary brushes and drag brushes pulled behind a small tractor.  \nRemedial techniques remove and clean or replace the infill (James and McLeod, 2008).   \nThe depth of infill relative to the pile height is important.  If infill depth is insufficient, there \nis not enough support for the fibre and the fibre will be subject to the phenomenon of capping \n(Figure 2), where the ends of the fibre fibrillate and fold over the infill permanently, reducing \ninfiltration rate.  An excess if infill will bury the fibre and play will effectively take place on \nfibre-reinforced sand.  Play tends to redistribute sand through actions such as sliding, foot fall \nand stick strikes, resulting in a spatially uneven distribution of sand due to an uneven \ndistribution of play and wear.  This can be addressed by regular drag brushing.  Routine \nFinal draft of James and McLeod (2010). Sports Technology, 3(1): 43-51. DOI:10.1080\/19346190.2010.504273 \n \ntopping-up of sand quantities is required because infill tends to be removed on clothing, \nequipment and machinery. \nThere are no published data on the relationships among infill quantity, infill contamination \nand pitch performance.  We present a laboratory study that aimed to establish the relationship \nbetween infill depth, contamination and surface performance parameters (ball rebound, ball \nroll, traction and hardness) for sand filled, second generation synthetic turf surfaces.  We test \nthe hypothesis that there is an optimum infill quantity (for a specific fibre length) and that \ninfill contamination is detrimental to surface performance, thus justifying maintenance of \nsynthetic turf. \n2 Materials and Methodology \n2.1 Test surface construction and preparation \nFor surface hardness, traction, ball rebound and infiltration testing, three, 1 m x 1 m x 150 \nmm deep test surfaces, were constructed in steel trays. 100 mm of MOT Type 1X stone \n(graded on site at Cranfield University, UK) was compacted and overlaid with 25 mm of tar-\nmacadam with 90% 6 mm crushed stone (Leisuretex Plus, Aggregate Industries, Coalville, \nUK).  Over this was laid a 15 mm prefabricated SBR shock pad and a 24 mm pile height \n(BSW, Bad Berleburg, Germany), 44100 tufts\/m\n2\n, polypropylene synthetic turf carpet (Tiger \nTurf Multi Turf MP24, Tiger Turf UK Ltd, Hartlebury, UK). \nA well sorted 0.71-0.25 mm diameter silica sand infill was used (2EW, Garside Sands, \nLeighton Buzzard, UK) at rates of 0, 10, 20, 25, 30 and 35 kg\/m\n2\n.  Infill was applied in 5 kg \nsteps and brushed into the surface with light compaction from a tamping device.  For \ncontamination testing, the sand infill was pre-mixed with a sandy loam soil (<0.5 mm) to \nsimulate field contamination and then applied in the same way; infill was added at 25 kg\/m\n2\n.  \nGrading curves for both these materials are shown in Figure 3. \nFor all ball roll testing, three longer (5 m) lengths of surface were laid on the level concrete \nlaboratory floor and infill and contamination applied in the same manner.  In this \nenvironment, vertical components of force are limited to gravitational effects and ball roll is a \npredominantly horizontal process and assuming that shock-pad stiffness is sufficient to resist \ndeflection by the ball, the sub-carpet construction (sub-base) has a limited effect on ball roll \nand this adaptation is appropriate to facilitate measurement of ball deceleration over a 1 m \ndistance without edge effects.  Ball roll testing also investigated the effect of fibre-\norientation.  In these experiments, the synthetic turf surface was brushed using a \npolypropylene drag brush typically used in synthetic turf maintenance (Sweepfast, Sutton \nColdfield, UK) with 150 mm long fibres of 2 mm diameter.  For the napped surface (single \nfibre orientation) the surface was brushed 50 times in a single direction.  The control \ntreatment was brushed in four directions alternately for 50 cycles. \n2.2 Determination of ball roll deceleration \nA 160 g, 73 mm diameter, field hockey ball (Kookaburra, Corby, UK) was released from a \nheight of 1 m (\u00b1 5 mm) down a 45\uf0b0 ramp conforming to EN 12234:2002.  Two infra-red \nFinal draft of James and McLeod (2010). Sports Technology, 3(1): 43-51. DOI:10.1080\/19346190.2010.504273 \n \ntiming gates were placed to measure ball velocity over 100 mm at 2 m (v1, m\/s) and 3 m (v2, \nm\/s) from the base of the ramp.  Mean ball deceleration (a, m\/s\n2\n) over 1 m (x, m) was \ndetermined using Equation 1.   \n \n   \n  \n    \n \n  \n      (1) \n2.3 Determination of ball rebound \nThe same hockey ball was dropped vertically without spin or impulse on to the test surface \nfrom 1.5 m as per the original FIH Handbook of Performance Requirements for synthetic turf \nsurfaces, which required the ball to rebound between 100 and 300 mm for a surface of this \ntype (\u2018standard\u2019 approval level; FIH, 1999).  Rebound height (\u00b1 20 mm) was measured from \nthe surface to the underside of the ball using an array of infra-red gates mounted at 20 mm \nspacing on a guide tube (1.5 m x 110 mm internal diameter). Each gate comprised an infra-\nred emitting diode and matched phototransistor.  A simple logic circuit was used to determine \nthe furthest gate triggered twice after ball impact.  This device has advantages over visual \nobservation methods in that it can be operated by a single user or remove the time spent in \nvideo post-processing but is limited by the measurement resolution.  A greater resolution can \nbe achieved by a more closely spaced array.  Since the development of the testing device, a \nsecond handbook has been published with an increased drop height of 2 m and a rebound \ncriterion of between 100 and 400 mm (\u2018national\u2019 approval level; FIH, 2008).  Therefore, ball \nrebound data are normalised to drop height using the coefficient of restitution, as per \nEquation 2.   \n   \n  \n  \n      (2) \nWhere, e is the coefficient of restitution, hr is the ball rebound height (m) and hi is the ball \nrelease height (m).  The FIH (1999) criterion is 0.258 < e < 0.447; the FIH (2008) criterion is \n0.224 < e < 0.447. \n2.4 Determination of surface hardness \nSurface rebound hardness was determined using a 0.5 kg Clegg Impact Hammer (CIH) \ndropped from 0.55 m height above the surface.  The device comprises an accelerometer \nmounted in a 0.5 kg cylindrical aluminium missile (55 mm diameter) which is dropped down \na guide tube (60 mm diameter) and the maximum deceleration on impact is recorded in the \nrange of 0-444 \u00b1 1.8 g (where g is multiples of the acceleration due to gravity).  The CIH was \ndropped three times and the deceleration of the third drop was recorded.  The initial potential \nenergy for this device is 2.70 J.  Dixon et al. (2008) observed that this is a 73% reduction \ncompared to the 2.25 kg (0.45 m drop height) CIH normally used in human-surface \ninteraction studies, however, it is similar to that of the hockey ball in the ball rebound \napparatus (2.35 J). \nFinal draft of James and McLeod (2010). Sports Technology, 3(1): 43-51. DOI:10.1080\/19346190.2010.504273 \n \n2.5 Determination of rotational resistance \nRotational resistance, as a measure of shoe-surface traction, was determined using a torque \nwrench at the peak torque (\u00b1 1 Nm) when rotating from rest a disc with a dimpled rubber sole \n(150 mm diameter), loaded axially with 46 kg as per EN 15301-1:2007. \n2.6 Statistical analysis \nAll methods were completed in triplicate for each replicate (3) of each test condition.  Linear \nregression analysis was used to model performance behaviour where p<0.05.  Analysis of \nVariance was used to separate treatment effects (p<0.05) and means compared using the \nLeast Significant Difference (p<0.05).  All statistical analysis was performed with GenStat \nv10 (Lawes Agricultural Trust, Harpenden, UK). \n3 Results \n3.1 Effect of infill quantity \nThe hardness of the surface increased linearly with increasing quantity of infill (p<0.001; \nFigure 4a). This is because as the quantity of infill increases, less fibre length is exposed \n(Figure 5) and less deformation of the fibre is possible, increasing deceleration on impact of \nthe CIH.  The hardness of the surface was inversely correlated with ball bounce (r = -0.8966; \np<0.01), which decreased linearly with increasing infill quantity (p<0.001; Figure 4b).  \nLathrop et al. (2001) determined that the rebound height of a soccer ball decreased with \nincreased infill quantity.  They also observed that Clegg hammer impact was influenced more \nby shockpad than infill quantity but that was for a 2.25 kg missile, rather than the 0.5 kg used \nin this study.  Studies of vertical cricket ball rebound on clay soil turf cricket pitches (Baker \net al. 2001) and football (soccer-ball) rebound on sand-based natural turf (Spring and Baker \n2006, Spring et al. 2007) have shown a positive correlation between hardness and ball \nrebound, although other authors (Adams et al. 2001) working on cricket ball bounce have \nreported no correlation between these parameters.  Both the cricket and football surfaces \nstudied are tightly bound by compaction and the grass plant and the stiffness of footballs and \ncricket balls is lower than hockey balls (Fuss, 2008; Ranga et al. 2009).  In our study, closer \ninspection of ball bounce behaviour showed that there was horizontal radial redistribution of \nthe unbound sand, reducing the energy returned to the ball on impact with the surface.  \nHorizontal displacement was not observed on impact of the cylindrical Clegg Impact \nHammer. \nIncreasing infill quantity decreased rotational resistance linearly in the range of 0-35 kg\/m\n2\n \napplied (r\n2\n=0.853, p<0.05; Figure 4c).  At low infill quantities turf fibres and to an extent the \ninfill were interlocked with the rotating dimpled rubber sole.  At greater infill quantities, fibre \n\u2013 sole contact area was reduced and the infill had a low internal shearing resistance as \nrounded sand particles were able to mobilise with the shear stress of the traction device.  Ball \nroll deceleration was non-linear (p>0.05 for linear regression).  Analysis of variance \ndetermined that ball roll deceleration is best described by a linear increase in deceleration \nfrom 0-10 kg\/m\n2\n followed by a plateau of non-significant change in deceleration between 10 \nFinal draft of James and McLeod (2010). Sports Technology, 3(1): 43-51. DOI:10.1080\/19346190.2010.504273 \n \nand 35 kg\/m\n2\n (p<0.001; Figure 4d).  The initial increase in deceleration is due to the \nadditional ball \u2013 surface friction caused by the additional infill material. \n3.2 Effect of infill contamination \nThe effect of infill contamination was less marked than that of infill quantity.  Contamination \nhad an unexpected effect on hardness with a significant reduction at 20% contamination \n(p<0.001; Figure 6a).  It was hypothesised that hardness would increase with contamination \ndue to greater packing of the infill material due to contamination reducing the uniformity of \ngrading of the infill and that this would cause an increase in coefficient of restitution.  There \nis no significant effect of contamination on coefficient of restitution for ball rebound, \nhowever (p>0.05; Figure 6b). Likewise there is no significant effect on rotational resistance \n(p>0.05; Figure 6c) but there is a significant linear increase in ball deceleration with \ncontamination (r\n2\n>0.999; p<0.01; Figure 6d). \nInfill contamination reduced infiltration rate significantly (p<0.001, Figure 7a).  This is \nbecause the contamination reduces pore size within the infill matrix, reducing the \nconductivity of water into and through the infill.  An effect of packing on reducing pore size \nis also observed (p<0.001; Figure 7a).  Decreasing the pore size also increases water retention \ndue to capillarity and consequently increasing infill contamination causes the surface to \nremain wetter for longer (p<0.001; Figure 7b).  Reduced surface drying promotes an \nenvironment for moss and algae growth which can lead to slippery, unsightly surfaces with \npoor ball roll characteristics (McLeod and James, 2007) and it is hypothesised that the \ncontamination provides a substrate for such biological growth. \n3.3 Effect of brushing direction \nOrienting fibres away from the ball roll apparatus reduced ball deceleration significantly \ncompared to the upright fibres (p<0.001; Figure 8).  When fibres were oriented towards the \nball roll apparatus deceleration increased significantly compared to the upright fibre \ncondition.  When the ball is rolling against the fibre tips, there is greater resistance from the \nfibre and the ball is slowed and vice-versa.  Brushing of the surface in one direction only \nwould literally create a game of two halves, with a nap slowing the ball in one direction more \nthan the other.  It is essential to keep fibres vertical \u2013 a \u2018striped\u2019 surface achieved by creating \nan alternating nap would result in significant deviation of the ball in directions non-parallel to \nthe nap. \n4 Discussion \nThis study illustrates the importance of regular maintenance of synthetic turf surfaces.  The \nquantity of infill has a significant effect on the playability of the surface.  Determining \noptimum infill quantities is an optimisation of playability parameters and providing sufficient \ninfill to support the turf fibre and prevent capping (Figure 2).  To achieve the FIH:2008 \ncriterion for ball rebound (0.224 < e < 0.447), infill quantity should be in the range 20-35 \nkg\/m\n2\n (Figure 4b).  In this range of infill quantity, the 95% confidence intervals for rotational \nresistance decreased from 32 to 15 Nm which is below the minimum threshold of FIFA \n(2009), although that particular standard is for studded footwear in longer grass in soccer.  \nFinal draft of James and McLeod (2010). Sports Technology, 3(1): 43-51. DOI:10.1080\/19346190.2010.504273 \n \nMean values of 0.33 for coefficient of restitution, 126 g for hardness (CIH 0.5kg) and 28 Nm \nfor rotational resistance were reported in a survey of similar sand-filled surfaces (McLeod \nand James, 2008).  Severn et al. (2007) reported a range of 25-33 Nm for rotational resistance \nof a similar test device on water-based synthetic field hockey surfaces.   \nThere is no significant change in ball deceleration between 20 and 35 kg\/m\n2\n (Figure 4d) but \ninfill quantity in excess of 32 kg\/m\n2\n would mean that the fibre would be buried under the \ninfill (Figure 5) and less than 25 kg\/m\n2\n would leave >5 mm of fibre above the infill, \nincreasing the risk of capping. Therefore an optimum range of infill for this particular \nsurface, compacted in this manner is 25-30 kg\/m\n2\n.  Furthermore, the data highlight the \nimportance of maintaining infill quantities which reduce over time and are spatially \ninconsistent due to wear patterns of different sports.  Regular drag brushing to ensure even \ndistribution of infill is important and topping-up of infill quantities may be required, but the \ndirection of brushing must be rotated to prevent the formation of nap which can affect ball \nroll significantly (Figure 8). \nThe effect of infill contamination on playing performance parameters is less marked apart \nfrom for ball deceleration where there is a significant increase in ball deceleration with \nincreasing infill contamination meaning that ball roll will be reduced significantly.  This \neffect was observed on a dry surface.  Increasing infill contamination reduces infiltration rate \nsignificantly.  The FIH (2008) \u2018National\u2019 minimum infiltration rate is 150 mm\/h.  At 10% \ncontamination the infiltration rate of the compacted infill (most similar to field condition) is \nbelow this criterion.  Even in maintained surfaces, contamination can approach this number \nand is regularly exceeded where maintenance is not used (McLeod and James, 2008).  \nRegular brushing of the surface with contra-rotating power brushes and prevention of \ncontamination by maintaining clean footwear is essential to preventing degradation of \ninfiltration rate.  Synthetic turf facilities should be designed such that the ingress of \ncontamination from footwear is minimised by providing clean pathways for both users and \nmaintenance equipment to approach the surface, preventing contamination from surrounding \nsoil and turf areas. \nThe laboratory analysis reported here was conducted on new synthetic turf with newly \nsupplied infill over a relatively short period of time.  The effect of exposure to the natural and \nplaying environment is not considered in these experiments and they do not reflect a typical \n15 year life cycle.  Processes such as capping, infill contamination and moss growth occur \nover a longer time period than that tested here.  Furthermore the effect of packing density has \nnot been considered, except for infiltration rate testing and this should be explored further.  \nThe contamination added was soil, whilst representative of material brought in on footwear, it \ndoes not contain worn fragments of turf fibre or playing equipment which could affect the \ncontamination experiments, but any differences are likely to be minimal.  Of perhaps greater \neffect is the addition of contamination to the infill prior to application of the infill \u2013 thus \ndistributing the contamination evenly through the infill profile.  In the field, contamination \naccumulates at the surface of the infill profile and is then washed, brushed or driven into the \ninfill from the top.  Because the infill acts as a filter, this means that there is a gradient of \ncontamination through the profile from the surface to the base of the carpet.  This has a \nFinal draft of James and McLeod (2010). Sports Technology, 3(1): 43-51. DOI:10.1080\/19346190.2010.504273 \n \nparticular effect when comparing field contamination measurements to those in this \nlaboratory study.  The 10% of contamination measured in the field by McLeod and James \n(2008) was concentrated in the top of the profile, whereas it is evenly distributed in this \nstudy, such that contamination effects in the laboratory study are less severe than for the same \nconcentration in the field.  Once saturated, the infiltration of water into the infill is a function \nof infill pore matrix size and connectivity \u2013 a greater concentration of infill in the profile \nwould reduce infiltration rate further than the data shown in Figure 7, which present a \u2018best \ncase scenario\u2019.  So despite the limitations of the approach taken, the need for, and costs of, \nmaintenance of synthetic turf remain justified and the mechanisms of surface performance \nbreakdown remain the same. \nOur study focuses on relatively short-pile (20-25 mm) sand filled surfaces.  New installations \ntend to be longer pile (40-65 mm) and filled with both sand and rubber.  The optimum infill \nquantities for \u2018third generation\u2019 surfaces of this type will be dependent on pile length and the \npurpose for which the surface is to be used due to varying force reduction requirements.  \nHowever the need for ensuring even distribution of this optimum infill quantity\/mix remains.  \nThere is an increased risk of infill contamination from abraded rubber infill and the \ninfiltration and drainage mechanism is the same as the sand-filled system described above \nand therefore infill contamination must be minimised.  In that sense the findings of this study \nare transferrable to the new generation of longer pile, sand and rubber filled synthetic turf \nsurfaces. \n5 Conclusion \nThe playability of a second generation sand-filled synthetic turf surface, in terms of ball \nrebound, ball roll and rotational resistance is significantly (p<0.01) affected by the quantity of \ninfill, with an optimum 25-30 kg\/m\n2\n of infill required for the 24 mm carpet tested.  Adding \ncontamination to the infill decreases infiltration rate and reduces ball roll speed significantly \n(p<0.001).  There is no direct effect of contamination on rotational resistance or ball rebound \n(p>0.05).  Having established the mechanism for surface performance degradation, the use \nand cost of maintenance that ensures even distribution of the correct infill quantity and \nminimises the accumulation of contamination, is therefore justified.  An in-filled synthetic \nturf surface should not be considered as maintenance free and the minimisation of infill \ncontamination should be considered from design stage through to operation. \nFurther work is required to determine the effect of both time and environment on the findings \npresented here, but they provide initial characterisation of the mechanisms of synthetic turf \nsurface degradation. \n \nFinal draft of James and McLeod (2010).
