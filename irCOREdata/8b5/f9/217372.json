This project \nargued that metaphysics \u2013 our account of what causal laws are or what general causal \nclaims say \u2013 should march hand-in-hand with our ways of establishing them. It should be \napparent, given the kind of thing we think causality is, why our methods are good for finding \nit. If our metaphysics does not mesh with and underwrite the methods we are willing to trust, \nwe should be wary of both. \n \nMany philosophers nowadays look for a single informative feature that characterizes causal \nlaws. HC&UT argues instead for causal pluralism, for a large variety of kinds of causal laws \nas well as purposes for which we call scientific claims causal. Correlatively different methods \nfor testing causal claims are suited to different kinds of causal laws. No one analysis is \nprivileged and no methods are universally applicable. Much of the argument for pluralism is \nprovided by authors of different accounts of causality, who provide intuitively plausible \ncounterexamples to each other. Still, most of these accounts seem adequate for the kinds of \nexamples the authors focus on. From the point of view of HC&UT these examples involve \ndifferent kinds of causal laws or set causality to different jobs, and the concomitant \ncharacterizing feature marks out this one kind of causal law.  \n \nImportantly for the argument, often we can specify what characteristics a system of laws \nshould have in order for an account\/method pair to be applicable. An example is James \nWoodward\u2019s level invariance, which I see as a test but which he offers as a characterizing \ncriterion.2  Woodward argues by example: He shows that many noncausal associations are \nnot level invariant. HC&UT goes further. It proves that for a system of causal laws that \nsatisfy a number of familiar conditions, level invariance is sufficient for causality. The \nconditions include the requirements that causal laws be expressible as linear equations with \ndependent variable as effect and independent variables as causes (hence causality in this \nsense is deterministic and the effects of separate causes add); that causality be asymmetric \nand irreflexive; and that any true association among the quantities in the system can be \nderived from the causal laws. So level invariance is a provably good criterion for a special \nkind of system of causal laws and it can further underwrite a closely associated test. But \nneither the analysis nor the test are appropriate where causes act indeterministically, where \ntrue lawlike associations can hold without a causal base (perhaps conservation laws are like \nthis), where causation is cyclical or where linearity fails. \n \nAnother case are \u2018causal Bayes-nets\u2019, which are characterized by three axioms. Algorithms \nderived from these axioms can produce every causal graph consistent with given \nprobabilistic information, hence providing powerful methods for hunting causes. Given the \naxioms it is also possible to predict how changes in probability will propagate across the \n                                                          \n1 Sadly it thus short-changes other important scientifically relevant accounts, most notably process and activity \ntheories, in favour of those I have more expertise with.  \n2 Roughly, a linear equation is level invariant if it holds under surgical substitution (that is, changes made in \nmuch the way required in Lewis\u2019s counterfactual account of causality) of different values for right-hand-side \nvariables. Cf. Woodward (2003). \nsystem if the probability of one quantity is changed surgically.3 This can be extremely useful \nif ever we envisage making these kinds of changes.  But the methods both for testing and for \nprediction are only appropriate where the axioms hold.  \n \nHC&UT looks at cases where these axioms might fail. For example, the \u2018faithfulness\u2019 axiom \nsays that causes and effects are probabilistically dependent. But systems are often designed \nso that a cause\u2019s ineliminable positive contribution to an unwanted outcome is cancelled by \nits negative contribution. The \u2018causal Markov condition\u2019 says that two factors not related as \ncause and effect must be probabilistically independent once the causal parents of one are \nconditioned on. This can fail when probabilistic causes produce their effects in tandem, in \npopulations with so-called \u2018selection bias\u2019, when two unrelated quantities each change \nmonotonically in time, etc.  \n \nBayes-nets experts are naturally working hard to extend the methods to deal with cases like \nthese. But the point here is the lesson about pluralism and about the match of methods to \nkinds of causal laws. There is no reason to suppose that it is in the nature of causality that a \nprobabilistic cause produce its effects independently of each other (rather than in tandem) \nnor that properly caused quantities not share time trends nor that positive and negative \ncontributions to the same outcome from the same cause not cancel. The three axioms \nprovide criteria not for something to be a causal law but for one kind of causal law, with \nmatched methods for finding causal laws and using them. In the same vein my axioms pick \nout laws for which Woodward\u2019s level invariance is an appropriate criterion for causality and a \nsound basis for testing. \n \nA third example is manipulationist accounts. Woodward and Daniel Hausman take \ninvariance under (surgical) manipulation to be the key criterion for causal laws4. In a series \nof heroic efforts to establish unity among causal notions they tried to show that the causal \nMarkov condition so important for Bayes nets can be derived from this. Two chapters of \nHC&UT show that these efforts fail.  \n \nAt any rate, surgical interventions have little application. HC&UT looks at two further \nmanipulationist accounts that can do real predictive work. Econometrician David Hendry \ntakes causal laws to tell what happens under a proposed set of interventions.5 These laws \nlicense what chapter III.6 calls \u2018implementation-specific counterfactuals\u2019. The second \naccount, which I attribute to economic methodologist Kevin Hoover,6 takes causal laws to tell \nwhat happens under all intervention possible for us, which license \u2018implementation-neutral \ncounterfactuals\u2019.  \n \nThese geared-to-usage manipulationist accounts show how deeply causal pluralism cuts. \nHC&UT describes a machine where mechanical and manipulationist criteria dictate back-to-\nfront results: A causes B on the mechanical account; the reverse on a manipulationist. Yet \nmechanism and manipulation are both central to our thinking about causality.7  \n \n                                                          \n3 This involves leaving all causal laws intact except those producing the changed quantity plus supposing that \nwhat I have elsewhere called \u2018the strength of a cause\u2019s capacity\u2019 (measured by a particular partial conditional \nprobability) stays the same for all causes. See Cartwright (1989). \n4 See Hausman (1992). \n5 Hendry (2001). \n6 I take my interpretation from what I think is a literal reading of Hoover\u2019s definitions and it produces what I \nthink to be an excellent and exciting account of causation. Hoover however sometimes seems to want his \naccount instead to capture what I call \u2018mechanical\u2019 causation. See Hoover (2001). \n7 Some people feel that the manipulationist causal laws hold only \u2018on account of\u2019 the mechanical ones. I am not \nat all sure we can make sense of this \u2018on account of\u2019; but even if we can, I don\u2019t see how it privileges one over \nthe other as an account of what a causal law is. (Of course on my view it should make sense to say that they all \nhold on account of thick causal relations.) \nThe last chapter of HC&UT, from research done jointly with Julian Reiss, focuses on action-\nguiding counterfactuals, especially as treated in economics, which is different in interesting \nways from work familiar in our own field. I echo the standard advice to evaluate \ncounterfactuals from a \u2018causal model\u2019, but a model that represents the causes and causal \nlaws that obtain post-intervention since interventions typically change causes other than the \ntargeted one and not unusually change the causal laws at work as well.8 This advice is all to \nthe good. EXCEPT: Our methods for hunting causal laws, as well as concomitant accounts \nof what causal laws are, are almost all suited for establishing pre-intervention models, not for \nconstructing models of what causes and causal laws obtain post-intervention, which is a \nmore creative, less rule-governed enterprise.  \n \nWhen this problem became clearly visible, near the end of the project that spawned HC&UT, \nI realized that it is not enough to match metaphysics and method. Use must mesh with these \ntwo as well. Knowledge of causal laws should gain us something; it should empower us to \ndo things, make new inferences and make new outcomes. But how do we know that what \nhas been warranted by our tests for causal laws will in turn warrant the inferences we want \nto draw from them? Normally it should be metaphysics that does this job: We can see from \nour account of what causal laws are both why our methods are good for testing them and \nwhy our inference from them are justified. Available accounts of causal laws, even when \nrestricted to specific kinds of causal laws or specific purposes, are too close to either hunting \nor using to do this job. They are almost read off from either a favoured method for testing \ncausal claims or a favoured use to which they might be put. So HC&UT ends on a despairing \nnote. Despite all the hard work already done, we still need richer, more detailed theories of \ncausal laws if we are to justify using the causal knowledge we pay so dearly to gain. \n \n \nReferences \n \nAlexandrova, Anna (2006), \u2018Connecting Economic Models to the Real World\u2019, Philosophy of \nthe Social Sciences, 36: 173-192.  \n---- (2007) \u2018Making Models Count\u2019, Philosophy of Science 75: 383-404.  \n \nCartwright, Nancy (1989).
