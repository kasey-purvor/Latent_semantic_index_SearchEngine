While the goal of complete debt \ncancellation remained elusive, the anti-debt network could be credited with raising \npublic awareness around the issue and placing it on the agenda of creditor \ngovernments and international financial institutions (Donnelly 2002; Fogarty 2003).ii  \nYet the overall success of the debt cancellation campaign masked significant \nnational differences, even between neighboring countries: while 2,960,262 persons \nsigned the Jubilee 2000 petition in the UK, only 1,200,381 did so in Germany, and \n521,319 in France (respectively 4.97, 1.45 and 0.87 percent of the national \npopulation). The organization and timing of the campaigns also differed: two years \nafter its London creation in October 1997, the Jubilee 2000 Coalition had sprouted \nsimilar organizations in five of the G7 members; Germany was an early joiner,  \nFrance among the two exceptions.iii Why did debt cancellation achieve such \n \n \nprominence in the UK and, albeit to a lesser extent, Germany, while remaining a \nmarginal issue in French associational and political circles? This is what this paper \ninvestigates, in the process drawing a picture of transnational activism in which the \nnational is given pride of place. \n \nFROM TRANSNATIONAL ACTIVISM TO DOMESTIC POLITICAL \nOPPORTUNITIES \n \nIn recent years, a rapidly expanding literature has focused on the emergence of cross-\nborder activism, seen as a direct or indirect response to globalization (e.g. Keck and \nSikkink 1998; O'Brien, Goetz, Scholte and Williams 2000; Fiorini 2000; Khagram \n2002; Anheier, Glasius and Kaldor 2005; della Porta and Tarrow 2005). However it is \nonly recently that attention has turned to the mechanisms whereby macro structures \nand changes might translate into actual mobilization (see notably Ancelovici 2002; \nGiugni 2002; Tarrow 2002; Johnson and McCarthy 2005; Kolb 2005). These \nmechanisms matter: while growing transnational linkages may create the objective \nreasons for and conditions of a rise in transnational activism, they cannot on their own \nexplain why cross-border mobilization actually takes place. As social movement \ntheorists remind us, three obstacles must be contended with: 'the weakness or absence \nof social networks outside people's neighborhoods, towns, cities, social groups, and \npolitical allegiances; the weakness or absence of transnational collective identities; \nand the absence of mechanisms to compete with the political opportunities of national \npolities' (Tarrow 2001, 14). Focusing on global civil society or transnational advocacy \nnetworks can further obscure the fact that oftentimes the message and tactics being \n2 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nspread across borders developed within a particular domestic setting, and might not \nthrive on foreign soil. To better grasp the extent and dynamics of cross-national \nactivism, one must therefore take a closer look at the micro sociological mechanisms \naffecting the behavior of societal and political actors at the domestic level. A \ncomparative approach can yield valuable insights. \nFollowing a triptych well established among students of societal mobilization, \nwork on the cross-national diffusion of protest has typically underlined three types of \nconditions: the existence of mobilizing structures; cultural proximity or similarity; and \nfavorable political opportunities (Kriesi, Koopmans, Duyvendak and Giugni 1995, \n188-91; Smith, Chatfield and Pagnucco 1997; Tarrow 1998). It is the latter that is \nprivileged here. The notion of 'political opportunity structure' (POS) can be defined as \nthose 'dimensions of the political environment that provide incentives for people to \nundertake collective action by affecting their expectations for success and failure' \n(Tarrow 1998: 85). In their more static form, political opportunity structures generally \nrefer to different levels of institutional access to policy makers, which alter the \nlikelihood of protest (e.g. Kitschelt 1986). However political opportunity structures \ncan also be determined by changing political environments, in which elected officials \nand political oppositions can both mediate the impact of transnational activism. In \nsome cases, new political opportunities can even be seized upon by challengers and \nused to pry open institutional barriers. Unstable political alignments, divided elites, \ninfluential allies and support groups all become critical aspects of political \nopportunity (Tarrow 1998: 78-80).  Last, political opportunity structures possess a \ncultural dimension since political opportunity may depend less on objective facts than \non actors' perceptions that chances of success are opening up (Gamson and Meyer \n3 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1996; McAdam, Tarrow and Tilly 2001). \n While acknowledging that institutional access and shifting political \nenvironments may exert a significant impact on domestic mobilizations, it is this latter \ndimension that we wish to explore here from two different angles, both comparatively \nunderstudied in the context of global activism. The first concerns the effects of \nemulation and competition between different groups of domestic activists, as these \ncan both expand and limit perceived political opportunities. On the one hand, past or \nconcomitant social movement activity may exert a 'structural' impact on existing \npolitical opportunity structures by encouraging mobilization through a demonstration \neffect (Kitschelt 1986: 62). In the case of past movements, there may even be \norganizational remnants in the domestic political environment, \u2018holdovers\u2019 that will \nprovide the necessary social underpinning for future action (Almeida 2003: 350). On \nthe other hand, scholars working at the border between POS and cultural approaches \nto mobilization have argued that the success of a particular movement will depend on \nthe congruence of its mobilizing message with that of the \u2018master frame\u2019 shaping the \nwhole cycle of protest within a given polity (Snow and Benford 1992; Diani 1996). \nBy helping to define which issues and repertoires have the greatest mobilization \npotential in the national context, past or concomitant movements may thus enhance or \nreduce activists\u2019 ability to take advantage of perceived changes in the political \nopportunity structure, such as greater institutional access, divided elites or \ninternational openness. Not only can \u2018objective\u2019 opportunities be missed; the scope \nfor constructing, by rhetorical means, new political opportunities may also be \nreduced. \nIn the case of transnational protests, perceived political opportunities are also \n4 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbound to be affected by multilevel decision-making and activism. In one of few \nattempts to factor in the interactions between international and domestic governance, \nKathryn Sikkink looks at international opportunity structures, i.e. \u2018the degree of \nopenness of international institutions to the participation of transnational NGOS, \nnetworks and coalitions\u2019 (Sikkink 2005: 156). Combining international openness with \nnational openness helps account for differentiated patterns of activism around \ntransnational issues. For instance, closure in both political arenas is likely to \ndiscourage mobilization; however a combination of international closure and \ndomestic openness should result in \u2018defensive transnationalization\u2019. This time, \nactivists will engage in a broad repertoire of political activities at the domestic level, \nand try through their impact on domestic governments to gain more access to \ninternational institutions. By the same token, David Meyer suggests looking at how \ndomestic political opportunity structures are 'nested' within their larger international \nenvironment, and how changes in the international context, or perceptions thereof, can \nalter the opportunities for activists within domestic settings (Meyer 2003). \nInternational institutions and regimes provide not only targets but, most significantly, \narenas for social movement activity. Heads of state may successfully take advantage \nof international gatherings to press a new agenda, giving a previously remote policy \narea increased visibility and opening up new opportunities (or perceptions thereof) at \nthe domestic level. Cross-border protests may provide focal points for activists, \nofficials and the media, fostering new interorganizational ties and giving added \npublicity, even legitimacy to national actors (Kolb 2005). The way domestic political \nopportunities interact with international access and transnational events cannot be \noverlooked. \n5 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n In the end, four aspects of domestic political opportunity structures are \ntherefore explored here: domestic institutional access; changing political environment; \nimpact of past or concomitant movement activity; interactions with international \nopportunities. By establishing how well these account for differences in the scope, \ntiming and dynamics of the 1990s campaign for the cancellation of poor country debt \nin our three countries, we hope to better assess their relative contribution to our \nunderstanding of cross-border protests. The next section takes a closer look at the \nthree domestic campaigns. In a fourth section, explanations relating to the specific \npolitical settings in which the campaigns took place are suggested. A fifth section \nconcludes. \n \nTHE DEBT CANCELLATION CAMPAIGN: NATIONAL INSIGHTS \n \nBefore presenting the three domestic campaigns, a few words on the transnational \ndimension of the anti-debt protest are in order. As mentioned in the introduction, the \nJubilee 2000 campaign rapidly established itself as the epitome of successful cross-\nborder campaigns in the area of international finance. The coalitions that were \nfostered in well over fifty countries encompassed churches, anti-poverty groups, trade \nunions and a myriad of other organizations, many of which had not worked on debt \nissues before. Campaigners targeted a network of creditor countries and international \nfinancial institutions previously thought to be largely impervious to external \ninfluence, yet managed to extract commitments and actual (if sometimes limited) \npolicy changes. In accounting for this overall success, \u2018global\u2019 elements have often \nbeen emphasized: the role of the internet in enabling collaboration within and across \n6 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncountries; that of the news media in spreading awareness and achieving maximum \nleverage from celebrity involvement; the focus on G7 Summits and IMF\/World Bank \nannual meetings. Yet another, equally striking ingredient of the campaign was the \nautonomy left to national coalitions, each of which created its own decision-making \nstructure, and to member organizations within. Tensions were rife: between South and \nNorth, reformists and radicals, even at times between the UK coalition and others \n(notably the US) over perceived efforts to assert global leadership around the \ncampaign (see in particular Donnelly 2000). But crucially (perhaps inevitably) the \ntransnational network underpinning the protest remained highly decentralized, \nfunctioning as a coalition of autonomous campaigns. It is this national dimension that \nwe want to capture here, by looking at patterns of mobilization in three creditor \ncountries: Britain, Germany and France. \n \nBritain: the irrepressible Jubilee 2000 Coalition \n \nThe Jubilee 2000 Coalition grew out of an alliance of aid agencies, the Debt Crisis \nNetwork (DCN), led by the New Economics Foundation, Christian Aid and the World \nDevelopment Movement, which had been working on the debt issue since the \nMexican debt crisis of 1982 (Pettifor 1998; Dent 1999). While many secular \norganizations eventually joined the movement, including trade unions, much of the \ninitial impetus and financial backing behind the initiative came from Christian \nagencies: Christian Aid, CAFOD and Tearfund, all members of Eurodad.iv The very \nname of the campaign linked the Biblical concept of Jubilee with the approaching \nMillennium. A small office was set up in 1996, and in October 1997, the Jubilee 2000 \n7 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCoalition, counting around 70 members, was launched in the Grand Committee room \nof the House of Commons.  \nThe coalition soon proved its reach, with the organization of a 70,000 strong \n\u2018human chain\u2019 during the May 1998 Birmingham Summit, following which Prime \nMinister Tony Blair paid \u2018tribute to the Jubilee 2000 Campaign and its dignified \nbreaking-the-chain demonstration' in a speech to the House of Commons. In February \n1999, the intervention of U2 singer Bono and boxing champion Muhammad Ali at the \nBrit Awards gave the campaign a new publicity boost: not only did all major British \npapers give the event extensive coverage, the Express officially endorsed the \ncampaign. In June, as the Cologne Summit was being convened, more initiatives \nfollowed with the screening on prime time television of Comic Relief's anti-debt show \nand the organization of a new human chain of over 30,000 people along the banks of \nthe Thames, which once again received significant media coverage. \nThroughout, Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown's ringing \nendorsements of the anti-debt campaign provided further visibility. In February 1999, \nan article co-written with International Development Secretary Clare Short pressed for \nurgent action and announced Britain had proposed to the G7 finance ministers 'new \nand more challenging targets for wiping out more debt' (The Guardian, 22 February \n1999). On 7 March 1999, addressing a Jubilee 2000 public meeting in St Paul\u2019s \nCathedral, the Chancellor described poor country debt as \u2018the greatest single cause of \npoverty and injustice across the earth and potentially one of the greatest threats to \npeace\u2018, as well as \u2018the great moral issue of this day and this decade\u2018, adding \u2018we must \ncut the debt and do so now\u2019, and \u2018I say to the churches and to all who support Jubilee \n2000 - as I do - we thank you\u2019. In December, the Chancellor announced that Britain \n8 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwould cancel 100 percent of debts owed to it by 26 countries by the end of 2000. By \nthen, a thriving Jubilee 2000 Group had also developed among MPs of all political \npersuasions (Dent 1999: 35). \nWith member organizations now numbering over 160, campaigners\u2019 efforts \ncontinued throughout the year 2000, with events such as \u2018Red letter day on Third \nWorld Debt\u2018, which saw 8000 letters being delivered to 10 Downing Street and G7 \nembassies on 3 June; the launch of a widespread e-mail action by stars and \ncampaigners at the end of June; and demonstrations by Christian Aid activists wearing \nTony Blair masks at the end of July. The extensive media coverage paid off: in June \n2000, a CAFOD survey by MORI showed that 50 percent of respondents recognized \nthe name \u2018Jubilee 2000\u2019. By the end of the year, the British public had contributed \n2,960,262 signatures to the Jubilee 2000 Petition.  \nAll the while the British government reaffirmed its commitment: in July, \nGordon Brown proposed a \u2018debt relief for peace\u2019 initiative. In September a meeting \nwas organized between campaigners, IMF Managing Director Horst K\u00f6hler and the \nBritish government. On 2 December, the Chancellor announced that Britain would \nstop taking debt repayments from the 41 poorest countries.  \nAs the Jubilee 2000 UK coalition reached its Millennium deadline, on 2 \nDecember 2000, new initiatives were announced. Director Ann Pettifor would head \nJubilee+, a support unit for campaigns on international debt and finance based at the \nNew Economics Foundation. Deputy Director Adrian Lovett would lead the Drop the \nDebt campaign to target the 2001 Genoa Summit. UK-based organizations including \nCAFOD, Christian Aid and Tearfund would continue to coordinate policy and activity \non debt cancellation as part of a Debt Network. In March 2001, Jubilee Debt \n9 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCampaign (JDC) became the successor to Jubilee 2000 UK and Drop the Debt. \nComprising a similarly broad range of  around 130 partner organizations, it has \nfocused strongly on the UK government and parliament.  \nYet to some extent Jubilee 2000 UK was victim of its own success. By 2003, \nthe organization of a World Debt Day to commemorate the 1998 Birmingham Summit \nonly attracted some 2000 campaigners, with media coverage only by the Guardian; \nand while Sir Bob Geldof was happy to attend, Gordon Brown addressed the \ngathering by pre-recorded video. The political impetus was not altogether lost \nhowever, as showed by the Chancellor\u2019s announcement in September 2004 that \nBritain would pay off 10 per cent of the money owed by 32 of the world\u2019s poorest \ncountries to the World Bank and the African Development Bank (The Guardian, 24 \nSeptember 2004). \n \nGermany: up and down \n \nThe German arm of the Jubilee 2000 campaign, Erlassjahr 2000, was set up in \nSeptember 1997. During the year 1998, membership increased very sharply, from the \noriginal 47 organizations to over 700. These were mostly church-related grassroots \nbodies, though a growing number of nationwide organizations, both religious and \nsecular, joined the campaign. Especially significant was the backing of Misereor, the \nGerman Catholic bishops\u2019 organization for development cooperation and main \nfinancial support of the campaign, and of WEED (World economy, Ecology and \nDevelopment), whose annual debt report (published since 1994) proved a central \ninstrument for raising awareness among the German public. February 1998 saw the \n10 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfirst of several postcard campaigns, with thousands of postcards sent to Bonn on the \n45th anniversary of the cancellation of Germany\u2019s wartime debts. In May, German \nactivists took part in the British human chain (Pettifor 1998: 116).  \nSoon after his election in October 1998, SPD Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der \ndeclared in the Bundestag that the German government would present an initiative on \ndebt at the Cologne Summit, thus breaking with a longstanding German opposition to \ndebt cancellation. New Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development \nHeidemarie Wieczoreck-Zeul (also known as \u2018Rote Heidi\u2019 for her left wing positions \nwithin the SPD) further emphasized that debt cancellation had become a high priority \nissue for the German government (Frankfurter Rundschau, 4 December 1998). On 27 \nJanuary 1999, in a personal article written in the Financial Times, Chancellor \nSchr\u00f6der declared that \u2018it is clear that without a radical debt reduction in many of the \npoorest countries there is no hope of bringing about a fresh start\u2019, and proposed new \ninitiatives in that direction, including the complete cancellation of debts from ODA \nfor Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs).  The initiative was hailed by Jubilee \n2000 supporters as \u2018a fantastic success [\u2026] Germany are no longer the bad guys \u2013 and \nno other country can use them as an excuse for inaction\u2019 (Adrian Lovett of Jubilee \n2000, The Guardian, 22 January 1999). Erlassjahr 2000 announced it would organize \nit own human chain on the occasion of the forthcoming Cologne Summit \nBy May 1999, Erlassjahr 2000\u2019s membership had climbed to 1600 \norganizations. On 12 June 1999, an information vigil was organized in Frankfurt, and \non 19 June, the promised human chain was formed in Cologne, with 35,000 \nparticipants. That same day, also the occasion of the protestant church day, a 15,000 \nstrong demonstration took place in Stuttgart. The Jubilee 2000 petition was handed \n11 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nover to Chancellor Schr\u00f6der, in the presence of the Honduran Bishop Oscar \nRodriguez (patron of Erlassjahr 2000) and the ubiquitous Bono. In June, Ms \nWieczoreck-Zeul expressed the federal government\u2019s gratefulness for Erlassjahr \n2000\u2019s support around the debt initiative (Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 11 June \n1999). A few months later, Uschi Eid, parliamentarian State Secretary at the Federal \nMinistry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), insisted once again \nthat the campaign had been instrumental to the launch of the Chancellor\u2019s debt \ninitiative (Die Tageszeitung, 27 November 1999). \nIn December 1999, Erlassjahr 2000\u2019s membership peaked at almost 2000 \norganizations. Yet disappointment with the federal government was becoming \nmanifest, J\u00fcrgen Kaiser, the political coordinator of the campaign (and a member of \nEurodad\u2019s executive board) deploring the lack of commitment demonstrated by the \ngovernment after the promising January start (press release, 31 December 1999). Still \nintent on keeping the issue alive, in the run-up to the Okinawa Summit Erlassjahr \n2000 began an information campaign on the debt issue. In May 2000, on the occasion \nof the visit of the Japanese Prime Minister, another information vigil was organized in \nfront of the Bunzelkanzleramt; a couple of months later the initiative was repeated, \nthis time in front of the Kaiser-Wilhelm Ged\u00e4chtniskirche in Berlin. Yet at Okinawa it \nbecame clear that Chancellor Schr\u00f6der was reluctant to support more debt \ncancellation, declaring \u2018It does not make sense to support those who do not know \nwhat to do with our help\u2019 (Handelsblatt, 24 July 2000). This hardening of the German \nofficial position was confirmed in later years.v This the activists soon criticized \nvigorously, as they did Germany\u2019s slow compliance with the Cologne resolutions \n(Actionaid, Eurodad and Oxfam 2005). Still, the campaign continued: during the \n12 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOctober 2000 IMF-World Bank meeting in Prague, Erlassjahr 2000 co-organized the \ndemonstration and representatives handed several thousand postcards to Mr Diller, \nState Secretary of the German Finance Ministry.  \nIn July 2001, Erlassjahr 2000 became Erlassjahr.de. Tellingly, only 400 of \nErlassjahr 2000\u2019 organizations initially extended their membership to the new \nalliance. By March 2002 the figure had risen to 700, still a far cry from the Erlassjahr \n2000\u2019s peak membership of December 1999. As for media coverage, a survey of the \nnumber of articles published on different German social movement organizations in \nthe Tageszeitung between January 2000 and December 2002 concluded that reporting \non Erlassjahr 2000 had been so infrequent it had to be grouped with that on radical \nactivists in the category \u2018others\u2019 (Kolb 2005: 113). Efforts continued however, with a \nnew postcard campaign targeted at Finance Minister Hans Eichel and Chair of the \nBundestag\u2019s Finance Committee Christine Scheel in June 2002. Over 20,000 \nsignatures were also collected on a petition in favor of a new, more transparent debt \nrelief process. In May 2003, on the occasion of the ecumenical church day in Berlin, \nErlassjahr.de joined forces with the Aktionb\u00fcndnis gegen AIDS (action alliance \nagainst aid) to organize a 5,000 strong demonstration on the debt issue. By \nSeptember, membership had risen again to 1000. The petition for a fairer debt process \ncontinued to circulate into 2004, notably through a two weeks \u2018Fairness Tour\u2019 across \nGermany, collecting 150,000 signatures, and was finally handed to Heidemarie \nWieczoreck-Zeul in May 2004. \n \nFrance: a belated and limited mobilization  \n \n13 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHaving failed to show up at Birmingham in May 1998, one observer pointing to their \nconspicuous under-representation (Pettifor 1998: 116), French activists began \ncirculating the Jubilee 2000 Petition in November 1998, via the campaign 'Pour l'an \n2000: annulons la dette' organised by the Comit\u00e9 d'action catholique contre la faim et \npour le d\u00e9veloppement (CCFD). Between February and June 1999, Agir Ici, AITEC \nand the CRID further made the campaign the first one of their newly created network, \n\u2018Pour une r\u00e9forme des institutions financi\u00e8res\u2018 (IFI). By mid-1999, around 60 NGOs \nhad been mobilized, many of them religious, leading a British observer to conclude \n'Even in Camdessus's France, the new Jubilee 2000 organization appears to be getting \noff the ground' (Peters 1999: 188). Falling in line with fellow British and German \nleaders, Socialist Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn declared the time had \ncome \u2018to abandon the politics of small steps\u2019 in the creditor response to the debt crisis \nand suggested countries eligible under the HIPC initiative should pay no interest on \ntheir aid debts for a generation. When on 14 June 1999, a few days before the \nCologne Summit, Dominique Strauss-Kahn and Cooperation Minister Charles \nJosselin received representatives from the associations involved, around 520,000 \nsignatures had been collected. Campaign organizers further claimed to be engaged in \na dialogue with the French government over the issue, and notably over the use of the \nfunds to be freed by debt alleviation (Les Nouvelles de la Dette, 7 September 1999).  \nHowever the aftermath of the Cologne Summit marked a low point for anti-\ndebt campaigners. The rise of a new campaign on reforming international financial \ninstitutions on the agenda of the IFI network meant the issue became less prominent. \nFew signatures were added to the still circulating Jubilee 2000 petition - the final \ncount in 2000 would show 521,319 French signatures. Significantly, French officials \n14 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrefused to set up follow up meetings despite written solicitations (Les Nouvelles de la \nDette, 19 December 1999).  \nThe coalition then found a new impetus. Having first declared its interest in \nthe Jubilee 2000 campaign during its June 1999 Journ\u00e9es Mondiales, high-profile \nmovement ATTAC began mentioning debt cancellation among its rapidly multiplying \nobjectives. From January 2000 trade unions CFDT, CFTC and CGT also became \ninvolved in the campaign. New events followed. On 12 April 2000, the organization \nof the first anti-debt demonstration took place in Paris, targeting the Finance Ministry-\nhosted Paris Club.vi Coordinated by the CCFD, but with the active involvement of \nATTAC, it reportedly gathered \u2018hundreds\u2018 of protesters, admittedly a meager result \ncompared with the scale of similar initiatives across the Channel but for some \nobservers a \u2018symbolic first\u2018, and one that saw a delegation of campaigners being \nreceived by Paris Club Vice-President Philippe de Fontaine-Vive. That same month, \nFrance agreed to cancel 100 percent of the public debt owed by the 12 countries of the \nzone franc eligible under the HIPC initiative. In June, to celebrate the first anniversary \nof the Cologne Summit, prefectures throughout France were targeted by campaigners \n(the initiative was repeated in 2001 and 2002). \nEmulating similar developments abroad, a new 'platform', Dette & \nD\u00e9veloppement, was set up in March 2001. Still coordinated by the CCFD, it counted \namong its 26 members religious organizations and trade unions, alongside NGOs and \nactivist movements. Also involved in the platform was the emerging CADTM-France, \nsignaling that twelve years after the creation of the radical, Brussels-based anti-debt \nnetwork, France was finally \u2018ripe\u2019 for action.vii  \nIn July and August 2001, in a series of open letters, President of ATTAC \n15 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBernard Cassen challenged presidential candidates Lionel Jospin and Jacques Chirac \nto take position on the Tobin tax and debt cancellation. In October, a BVA poll \ncommissioned by the CCFD suggested that 59 percent of the French public believed \ndeveloped countries did not make enough efforts in the area of debt relief, with \nsupport for additional measures especially strong among the Left, the Greens and the \ncenter-right UDF. By January 2002, party leaders expressing support for the \ncancellation of third world debt ranged from Front National Jean-Marie Le Pen to \nLutte Ouvri\u00e8re\u2019s Arlette Laguiller through to UDF Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou and PS Fran\u00e7ois \nHollande.  \nEfforts to promote debt relief continued beyond the 2002 elections and the \narrival of a right-wing majority. In June 2002, ATTAC joined others within Dette & \nD\u00e9velopment to ask the government once again to support debt cancellation within \nthe G8; on 19 June, another protest was organized in Paris. In the run up to the June \n2003 Evian-Les-Bains Summit, ATTAC launched a new campaign around the sale of \nrap CD 'ATTAC ta dette', in a clear effort to mobilize young publics. So did Dette & \nD\u00e9veloppement with the release, in late January 2003, of world music CD \u2018Drop the \nDebt\u2019. As the Summit itself was taking place, a European march against debt was \norganized. Debt cancellation thus continued to 'surf' the altermondialiste wave, never \nthe key issue but a significant background leitmotiv nonetheless. \n \n \nEXPLAINING THE DIFFERENCES \n \nWhen comparing the British, German and French campaigns in favor of debt \n16 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncancellation, several things stand out. First, the relatively modest scope of French \nefforts compared to British and German ones in terms of both public and media \nendorsement. The Jubilee 2000 Petition attracted slightly over half a million \nsignatures in France, versus nearly one and half million in Germany and three \nmillions in the UK;  the few demonstrations organized by Dette & D\u00e9veloppement \ninvolved a few hundreds of protesters at best, and generated limited media interest, as \ndid the rest of the campaign. In stark contrast, the British campaign was actively \nendorsed by rock stars and sporting legends, broadcast on prime time TV and well \ncovered in the press. And while the German campaign lacked the scope and glamour \nof the British one, it got extensive media coverage both before and after the Cologne \nSummit. \nA second difference lies in the timing of the mobilization of both societal and \npolitical actors around the issue. Whereas the Jubilee UK coalition was already in full \nswing by 1998, most visibly around the Birmingham Summit, with Erlassjahr 2000 \nfollowing closely behind, the French campaign remained relatively low key until \n1999;  the first protest only took place in April 2000, a few months from the \nannounced Millennium deadline. By the same token, the Jubilee 2000 campaign was \nwidely endorsed by the British political establishment almost from its inception. \nGerman politicians also signaled an early U-turn in the run-up to Cologne, when the \nSPD leadership came up in favor of the campaign. By contrast, few French political \nfigures mentioned the debt issue before 2001. \n Finally, the dynamics of the three campaigns differ: in Britain, mobilization \nappeared sustained from the Birmingham Summit of May 1998 right on to the \nMillennium deadline. It is only after 2001 that interest in the issue began to wane, and \n17 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \neven then the successor movement to Jubilee 2000 UK retained a broad membership. \nIn Germany, decline set in earlier, in 2000; by the time Erlassjahr 2000 became \nErlassjahr.de in July 2001, membership had already dropped, along with public \ninterest. In France, mobilization is best described as intermittent, with feeble \u2018peaks\u2019 \nin the run up to Cologne, the Spring of 2000, the Autumn of 2001 and the run-up to \nthe 2003 Evian-Les-Bains Summit. In trying to account for these features of the three \nanti-debt campaigns, one can return to the four dimensions of domestic political \nopportunity structures already underlined.  \n \nInstitutional access \n \nAmong the differences often pointed out in the comparative politics literature on the \nthree countries, those relating to institutional access, and especially the way \nauthorities have traditionally dealt with challengers, figure quite prominently. In \nBritain, inclusive strategies have generally prevailed, albeit of an informal nature. In \nGermany, despite an overall exclusive strategy challengers could count on some \nformal access, an important element behind the success of the new social movements. \nIn France however, 'selective exclusion' has been the rule, the state only settling for \nsubstantive concessions if the social movement's demands happened to correspond to \nthe political goals of the governing coalition. This, according to social movement \ntheorists, generally discouraged broad mobilization (Kriesi et al. 1995: 36).  \nResponses to anti-debt coalitions seemed to fit these general patterns. Contacts \nbetween British debt campaigners and institutional\/political actors were sustained \nfrom an early stage. As the campaign unfolded, co-founder of Jubilee 2000 Martin \n18 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDent wrote that 'A great deal of dialogue is taking place with MPs and MEPs, with the \nTreasury, with the Department for International Development (DFID)', adding: 'It is \nimpressive to see how MPs of different parties who disagree on many other issues \ncombine in this great cause' (Dent 1999: 35). Christian Aid and CAFOD concurred, \nlater claiming regular contact with DFID on the issue. Contacts were further \nformalized when, following the White Paper on International Development of \nNovember 1997, the 1998 Development Policy Forum was set up to promote more \neffective consultation on development issues. As could be expected, the biggest single \ngroup of participants came from development NGOs and debt relief was one of the \nmain issues debated. \n Contacts also existed between the federal government and the members of \nErlassjahr 2000, thanks in no small part to the major and long-standing role played by \ncivil society groups in development assistance. In the late 1990s, German \ndevelopment NGOs received 6 percent of Official Development Assistance (ODA), \ncompared with  3 percent in Britain and under one percent in France. Christian \norganizations Kindernothilfe, World Vision Germany and Misereor were key \nbeneficiaries.viii  Informal ties were also established: in February 1998, Dr Erhard \nEppler, former Minister for Economic Cooperation, became a patron of the campaign; \nand in the run up to the 1998 Birmingham Summit, Erlassjahr representatives met \nwith Dr J\u00fcrgen Stark, a senior official in the Ministry of Finance.  \n By contrast, until the early 2000s, institutional access for French debt \ncampaigners remained limited. The two lead actors on debt relief were the Elys\u00e9e (for \ngeneral impetus) and the Direction du Tr\u00e9sor of the Finance Ministry, host to the Paris \nClub and responsible for the bulk of debt treatment operations through the special \n19 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTreasury accounts. Neither seemed particularly keen to consult with civil society \nrepresentatives on the issue, despite a few encouraging signs in the run up to the \nCologne Summit. Things then appeared to change. In April 2000, even as the first \nprotest was being organized in the streets of Paris, a working group on debt relief and \ndevelopment involving debt relief campaigners alongside the Tr\u00e9sor was established \nwithin the Commission Coop\u00e9ration D\u00e9veloppement of the Foreign Affairs Ministry. \nIn January 2002, an Observatoire de la participation de la France au processus \nd\u2019all\u00e8gement de la dette des pays pauvres was set up by the Haut Conseil de la \nCoop\u00e9ration Internationale (HCCI) and Dette & D\u00e9veloppement to monitor the \nimplementation of bilateral and multilateral debt relief initiatives. The initiative was \nshort-lived however, the Observatoire disappearing a mere few months after its \ncreation under the new Raffarin government.   \n \nChanging political environment  \n \nAsked to comment on the (comparatively) poor success of the campaign on French \nsoil, Jubilee ambassador extraordinaire Bono simply concluded that \u2018in France the \ndebt issue receives limited media coverage because France has much to lose.\u2019 \n(Lib\u00e9ration, 9 October 2000). By 1999, the 41 HIPC candidates owed France $11.5bn \nat face value, versus $4.9bn for Germany and $2.4bn for Britain.ix Even more \nsignificantly \u2013 after all, France had nonetheless championed debt alleviation in the \nrecent past (Roberge 1988),  French policy-makers faced the necessity to meet the \nstringent budget criterion set up in the Maastricht Treaty and restated in the Growth \nand Stability Pact. One could therefore expect French officials to show greater \n20 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreluctance to endorse the campaign\u2019s goals than either their British or German \ncounterparts. \nHowever the pressure was also strong on Germany: upon coming to power, \nthe new government had pledged to balance the Federal Budget by 2006. With \neconomic slowdown and East-West discrepancies weighting heavily on domestic \nbudgetary items, the relative cost of deeper debt relief was by no means negligible. \nMoreover, the German government had a longstanding position on debt relief and its \nproposed financing to defend, the Bundesbank having consistently opposed the sale of \nIMF gold for that purpose. Yet in Germany, like in Britain, the arrival of leftwing \ngovernments gave the campaign a major impetus.  \nIn the UK, the support of Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown proved \nespecially critical. In September 1997, shortly before the creation of the Jubilee 2000 \nCoalition and, according to activists, partly in response to representations made to \nhim, Chancellor Brown launched the Commonwealth Debt Initiative.x He later proved \npassionate in his support for Jubilee 2000, famously paying tribute to his father, a \nChurch of Scotland minister, as he described third world debt relief as a moral issue \n(The Guardian, 11 May 1999), and repeatedly endorsing the movement's goals. He \nrelentlessly pressed his G7 colleagues on the matter, tabling key proposals in advance \nof most summits. The Jubilee 2000 campaign thus provides a striking illustration of \nthe role played by state actors as institutional allies in cross-border campaigns, an \naspect often overlooked in empirical work (Tarrow 2002: 22).  \nIn its early years, the German 'Red-Green' coalition also showed \u2018a clear and \nunprecedented commitment to the issue of development cooperation and poverty \nreduction\u2019 (DAC 2001: 20). The impact of this policy shift was keenly felt by anti-\n21 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndebt activists, as reported by left-leaning Erlassjahr member WEED: \u2018The change of \nnational government in 1998 provided a new context for WEED\u2019s work\u2019 (Eurodad \n1999: 27). As the new government of Social Democrats and Greens \u2013 the latter \nlongstanding supporters of poor country debt relief \u2013 took a more proactive stance in \nthe discussion on debt reduction, Erlassjahr representatives repeatedly emphasized \ntheir contribution to shaping the German position, leading to the German debt \ninitiative of January 1999. Conversely, German officials were happy to acknowledge \nthe role played by the coalition in bringing about progress on the debt issue, none \nmore so than SPD BMZ Minister Heidemarie Wieczoreck-Zeul.  \n By contrast, in France, where a leftwing coalition had come to power in May \n1997, political support remained sparse. Socialist Finance Minister Dominique \nStrauss-Kahn rarely referred to the debt issue. When, in March 1999, he finally \ndeclared the time had come \u2018to abandon the politics of small steps\u2019, his opinions were \nsaid not to have full governmental backing (Lib\u00e9ration, 12 March 2000). Happy to \ndwell on what was left of his domaine r\u00e9serv\u00e9 under cohabitation, President Chirac \nwas one of few to affirm his support for debt cancellation - in Okinawa in July 2000, \nin Genoa the following year, both times claiming credit for launching the HIPC \ninitiative at Lyon. But debt relief (or development assistance writ large) was not seen \nas a priority by a Socialist government intent on reigning in budget deficits in the run \nup to Economic and Monetary Union (Josselin 2004).  \nIt is only in the months preceding the 2002 elections (parliamentary and \npresidential) that debt cancellation seemed to surface on the mainstream agenda. On 5 \nOctober 2001, PS Secretary Fran\u00e7ois Hollande called for the cancellation of the \nbilateral and multilateral debt of the poorest countries, and of part of that of emerging \n22 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmarket countries, a move widely seen as designed to occupy Jacques Chirac's territory \nand to offset Lionel Jospin's apparent lack of interest for debt relief and development \nassistance (Losson and Quinio 2002: 283). By January 2002, candidates of all \npolitical hues were claiming support for the cancellation of third world debt.  \n \nPast and concomitant movement activity \n \nAs explained above, any explanation of British, German and French participation in \nthe global debt campaign must also consider the effect of emulation and competition \namong social movements. Both actors' perception of political opportunity structures \nand their ability to frame their message to maximum effect can change as a result of \npast or parallel protests. Here the British case clearly stands out. UK activism on the \ndebt issue was by no means a novelty: in 1986, an Oxfam UK media campaign had \nexposed the fact that African debt repayments to Britain exceeded aid monies. The \ncampaign, and subsequent efforts by the Debt Crisis Network, partly accounted for \nthe April 1987 Declaration by Chancellor Lawson that the British government favored \nthe cancellation of two-thirds of the principal of bilateral debt owed by the poorest \ncountries and longer terms at lower interest rates to repay the remaining debts \u2212 so-\ncalled Trinidad Terms (Donnelly 2002: 173). Significantly, the initiative was 'popular \nat home, giving Nigel Lawson a rare rave review in The Guardian, as well as \napproval by The Financial Times' (Evans 1999: 277). According to OXFAM \norganizer John Clark, the Debt Crisis Network succeeded in bringing \u2018the debt crisis \ninto popular culture\u2019 (Clark 1987: 26). This might explain why, in the 1990s, the debt \nissue seemed to resonate especially strongly in the UK: in a 1996 MORI survey, third \n23 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nworld debt already came 7th in the list of Britons' top ten global concerns, versus 9th \nfor Europe as a whole.xi  \n No such levels of awareness and support existed across the Channel. While no \ndata could be found on French public opinion regarding debt relief prior to the Jubilee \n2000 campaign, later figures suggest that support among the French public was far \nfrom unambiguous: in a BVA survey dated March 2001, asked if they would support \nfull, large, limited or no debt cancellation, 49 percent of respondents responded \nlimited or no cancellation, and only 44 percent full or large cancellation. Aid fatigue \nmay well have contributed to the low response of French publics and politicians: by \nthe end of 2001, France could claim to be carrying the heaviest burden by far among \nG7 countries, with the planned cancellation of $10.3bn under HIPC. Data on aid \npolicy (no separate indicators could be found for debt relief), suggest public support \nmay have been even weaker in Germany. In a poll dated July 1999, 68 percent of \nrespondents agreed with the statement: \u2018Instead of continuously supporting other \ncountries with credits and economic aid, we should invest the money in Germany\u2019 \n(Noelle-Neumann, 2002).   \nIn both Germany and France, attempts were made to 'adapt' the British-\ninspired frame to the domestic environment, with varying degrees of success. Like \ntheir British counterparts, who saw the adoption of the biblical name Jubilee 2000 as a \nkey ingredient in the campaign's rapid success,xii German campaigners \u2013 many of \nthem grassroots Christian organizations \u2212 were happy to emphasize the religious \novertones of the campaign, thus appropriating  ready-made symbols and solidarities \n(Smith 1996). However, using what could be qualified as a 'rhetoric of guilt', German \nanti-debt campaigners also drew repeated parallels between the plight of poor \n24 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncountries and that of post-war Germany, a country whose debts had been cancelled in \n1953. These efforts may well have contributed to shaking public apathy, ensuring a \nbroad and swift mobilization in the early years. However, in a context of budgetary \nausterity, and with the costs of reunification still painfully apparent, public support \nproved difficult to sustain. Significantly, the emergence of ATTAC Germany and its \nshrewd use of the news media in the aftermath of the 2001 Genoa Summit may also \nhave contributed to marginalizing the Erlassjahr campaign (Kolb 2005).  \nIn France, where the cleavage between Church and secularized state has \nretained unique political salience (Kriesi et al. 1995: 12), activists groups \u2212 many of \nthem confessional \u2212 avoided references to the term 'Jubilee', opting instead for more \nneutral formulas such as  \u2018Pour l'an 2000, annulons la dette\u2019 and Dette & \nD\u00e9veloppement. Once ATTAC had joined the campaign, in early 2000, efforts were \nalso made to align its values with those of the master frame developed in the \naftermath of the 1995 strikes, in which issues of citizen control and market regulation \nresonated more strongly than questions of equity and redistribution (Ancelovici 2002: \n432-6). Debt cancellation was largely framed as a necessary precondition for Southern \ncitizens and governments to reject the diktats of the IMF-G7-commercial banks nexus \n(ATTAC 2002: 122-8), rather than as a matter of social justice or even growth and \ndevelopment per se. However, debt relief struggled to emerge as a mobilizing cause, \nand from 2000 on remained best seen as one element of a broadening altermondialiste \nagenda.   \n \nInternational opportunities \n \n25 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFinally, the coincidence between explicit political support, mobilization surges and \nG7 Summits cannot be ignored. Initially taken aback by the sheer scope of the \nBirmingham mobilization (Pettifor 1998), Labour leaders soon saw an opportunity to \ndemonstrate (at relatively limited budgetary cost) both commitment to the Third \nWorld and international leadership. As a result, the British campaign turned into one \nof 'offensive transnationalization': operating in an open domestic political opportunity \nstructure, and no doubt further encouraged by the rapid internationalization of the \ncampaign, British activists used a wide range of protest and political pressure \nactivities directed at the home government and, partly through it, at other international \nactors. Conversely, as stated by a key member of the coalition: 'At crucial moments \nCAFOD has mobilized sister agencies in the US, Japan, Germany and France in \nfurtherance of the DFID debt position which CAFOD has shared' (DFID 2002: 3; see \nalso Evans 1999: 276). British activists thus utilized their relatively congenial \ndomestic environment to open up new international political opportunities, with \nsignificant consequences for other campaigns, not least the German one.   \n Indeed, the 1999 'U-turn' of the German government provides another, \npossibly even more striking example of intertwining domestic and international \nopportunities. Eager to establish his credentials on the world stage after the \nimpressive performance of fellow left winger Tony Blair, aware of the transnational \nscope and impetus of advocacy efforts, the incoming Chancellor broke with years of \ngovernmental opposition to debt cancellation when he declared his intention to \npresent an initiative at his first G7 Summit, and his administration provided critical \nbacking to the adoption of the enhanced HIPC initiative and associated commitments \non bilateral debt reduction, including the sale of IMF gold. In explaining Germany's \n26 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnew stance, the arrival of a 'Red-Green' coalition must therefore be considered in \nconjunction with an impending international event (the Cologne Summit) as well as a \ntransnational protest wave (that initiated around the Birmingham Summit). Domestic \nand international political opportunity structures were altered, favoring rapid German \nmobilization and policy innovation. The window of opportunity thus opened was \nshort lived however: with G7 leadership passing to another (even more debt relief-\naverse) country, and budgetary constraints reasserting themselves, by the time of the \n2000 Okinawa Summit, Chancellor Schr\u00f6der had reverted to a much cooler posture \nand Erlassjahr 2000 had begun its decline.  \nThe French campaign also offers interesting insights. In the absence of \nfavorable domestic political opportunities, mobilization surged only modestly and \nepisodically. The run up to Cologne saw some progress, as the Birmingham-born \nwave of protest and G7 peer pressure interacted to produce new opportunities. \nThereafter however, organizers CCFD and (from January 2000) ATTAC struggled to \nkeep the campaign alive. As was showed above, it is only in the months preceding the \n2002 elections that debt cancellation seemed to finally surface on the mainstream \npolitical agenda. There is little doubt that the impeding elections did affect the \ndomestic political opportunity structure: competition between the Socialist Prime \nMinister and the Gaullist President, both presidential candidates, became acute, and as \nLionel Jospin tried to enter the domaine r\u00e9serv\u00e9 of international development, debt \nrelief gained in political salience. Yet we would argue that the 2001 Genoa Summit \nand World Social Forum, both of which received considerable political endorsement \nand media coverage in France, provide another piece of the jigsaw. After Genoa, no \nFrench political leader could ignore the 'movement for global justice', in which \n27 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nATTAC France was a key participant (Fougier 2002). Once again, a shifting political \nenvironment at home and major protests abroad interacted, enabling debt relief to \ngarner political support, and debt activists to gain new institutional access. However \nneither election-induced domestic shifts nor somewhat distant (and, post 9\/11, \nreceding) transnational activism sufficed to affect enduringly the structure of domestic \npolitical opportunities, as showed by post-2002 developments.  \n \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n \nOverall, this survey of the British, German and French anti-debt campaigns supports \nearlier calls for a better understanding of the domestic embeddedness of transnational \nactivism (Tarrow 1998; Risse 2002; Ancelovici 2002; Tilly 2004). By comparing \nnational campaigns, we can gain a greater feel for domestic political settings and how \ncongenial these are to the birth or spread of transnational protest. Of course, other \nfactors may have played a role in the mobilization processes recounted here. \nOrganizational resources in particular differed, sometimes significantly.xiii Yet we \nwould argue that resources alone cannot explain either the scope or the dynamics of \nthe mobilizations: to take but one illustration, the yearly income of Misereor, the \nGerman branch of CIDSE and a key member of Erlassjahr 2000, far surpassed that of \nits British counterpart CAFOD. Still, despite humble beginnings (Pettifor 1998), the \nBritish coalition proved more adept at generating dedicated resources, seizing the \npolitical initiative and maintaining interest in the debt issue. \nMoreover, this work showed how a greater focus on the interplay between \n28 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndomestic and international opportunities could add to our understanding of the \nsuccess and limits of cross-border campaigns. Institutional access seemed \nsignificantly reduced in the French case compared to the other two, with likely \nconsequences for the ability of French activists to mobilize public and politicians. Yet \nthis relative lack of access could not adequately explain differences in either timing or \ndynamics. These, shifts in the domestic political environment (new coalitions in the \nBritish and German cases, forthcoming elections in the French one) went a long way \ntowards accounting for. At the same time, their impact was best evaluated in the light \nof changing international opportunities. Not only did G7 Summits provide focal \npoints and meeting places for transnational activists; they also affected domestic \npolitical opportunity structures and perceptions thereof, creating short-lived, but in the \ncase of Germany critical, windows of opportunity.  \nFinally, the importance of past or parallel social movement activity was \napparent. Not only did it explain the different rhetoric used in the three countries; it \nwas also essential in accounting for the scope, and even more the sustainability, of \nmobilization efforts. In the UK past movement activity appeared to have considerably \nbroadened the appeal of (and opportunities open to) the Jubilee 2000 coalition. The \nsuccessful Oxfam UK campaign established a precedent for both state and non-state \nactors; it left an institutional imprint in the form of the Debt Crisis Network; and, \nperhaps most importantly, it enshrined the debt issue in popular culture, defining a \n\u2018master frame\u2019 Jubilee 2000 would later draw on. More generally, the 1986 campaign \nand its follow ups opened up new opportunities for debt activists by enhancing \nexpectations of success. In the absence of such legacy the German and the French \ncampaigns struggled to impose their frame onto largely apathetic publics and \n29 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nofficials; they also suffered from the competition of newcomer ATTAC, the message \nof which either blurred or marginalized their own. \n More work is now needed on these two dimensions of political opportunity \nstructures, both to better articulate the mechanisms at play and to test their relevance \nto other cross-national and cross-campaign comparisons. However, focusing on the \narticulation between domestic and international political opportunities and on the way \npre-existing (or concomitant) movements and frames may interfere with cross-border \ndiffusion should help shed more light on a phenomenon still under-studied from a \ncomparative perspective: the rise of transnational activism. \n \n30 \n \n \n \n                                                          \ni The author would like to thank Miriam Allam for her efficient research assistance on \nthe German case, and the two anonymous referees for Social Movement Studies for \ntheir helpful comments. \n \nii       Work has since continued, notably with the establishment in April 2001 of \nfollow up movement Jubilee Movement International.  \n \niii       The other being Japan, which later established its own Jubilee coalitions. \n \niv   Eurodad (European Network on Debt and Development) is a network of 48 \ndevelopment non-governmental organizations from 15 European countries. \nThroughout the campaign, Eurodad\u2019s secretariat provided advice and support and \ncirculated relevant information to member organizations. \n  \n \n \n \n \n31 \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                      \nv    After siding with the French refusal to cancel Iraq\u2019s debts, Finance Minister Eichel \ndeclined to support Gordon Brown\u2019s October 2004 initiative, on the grounds that it \nwould not be acceptable to cancel the debts of African states even as the German \npeople were asked to shoulder harsh social cuts (Tagesspiegel, 5 October 2004). \n \nvi  The March 2001 creation of a Paris Club web site, coupled with pledges of greater \ntransparency by President Jean-Pierre Jouyet, would later be hailed as a significant \nbreakthrough by campaign coordinators. \n \nvii       The demands of the Comit\u00e9 pour l'Annulation de la Dette du Tiers Monde \n(CADTM) range from the cancellation of Third World external debt to the conversion \nof military spending into social and cultural expenditures.  \n \nviii  In 2003, the Evangelical and Catholic churches received euros 160mn from the \nfederal government.  \n \nix  Data from national Finance Ministries, accessible at: \n\"http:\/\/www.jubileeplus.org\/databank\/debttables\/bilateral.htm\"   \n \nx      Within the CDI the government would cancel the remaining aid debts, worth \n\u00a3132 million of those poorer (lower-middle income) Commonwealth countries that \nwould meet certain economic performance and good governance criteria.

Jubilee 2000 had more than twenty full-time staff in London, whereas we are only \ntwo, part-time. Jubilee 2000 used the media to the full, attracted stars like Bono, even \nproduced its own TV ads\u2019 (Lib\u00e9ration, 19 June 2002).
