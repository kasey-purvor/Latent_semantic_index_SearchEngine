A wealth of data has been obtained which may be used to predict the\nresidual gas density inside a cold vacuum system exposed to synchrotron radiation. In this\nstudy the effect of cracking of cryosorbed molecules by synchrotron radiation photons has\nbeen included.\nCracking of the molecular species CO2 and CH4 has been observed in recent studies\nand these findings have been incorporated in a more detailed dynamic gas density model for the\nLHC. In this paper, we describe the relevant physical processes and the parameters required\nfor a full evaluation.\nIt is shown that the dominant gas species in the LHC vacuum system with its beam\nscreen are H2 and CO. The important result of this study is that while the surface coverage of\ncryosorbed CH4 and CO2 molecules is limited due to cracking, the coverage of H2 and CO\nmolecules may increase steadily during the long term operation of the machine.\nIntroduction\nOver most of its circumference, the LHC vacuum system consists of a cold bore tube\ninside the 1.9 K cryomagnets combined with a perforated beam screen which is inserted in the\ncold bore to intercept beam induced heat loads from synchrotron radiation (SR), from image\ncurrents of the circulating beam and from photoelectrons. The experimental work on photon\nstimulated desorption in a vacuum system with cryosorbing walls started in 1993 at the Budker\nInstitute of Nuclear Physics (Novosibirsk, Russia) and at the Brookhaven National Laboratory\n(Upton, NY, USA) in the context of the SSC project. During these early studies it was\ndemonstrated that three physically distinct effects may occur: photon stimulated desorption of\n2chemically bound molecules, photon stimulated desorption of condensed, and thus only weakly\nbound molecules and finally the thermal vapour pressure of the condensed gas molecules.\nRecent studies, both at BINP and at CERN have highlighted in addition to these effects the\nimportance for the LHC of cracking of cryosorbed molecules by SR. This effect, which had not\nbeen taken into account in earlier studies, will be addressed in this paper.\nPhoton induced desorption in a vacuum system with cryosorbing walls\nIn contrast to a room temperature vacuum system, where the gas molecules are readily\nremoved by external pumps, in a cryogenic system molecules have generally a high probability\nto stick to the wall after only a few wall collisions. External pumping from the ends of a long\nvacuum vessel is rather inefficient and in most cases for the LHC, pumping from the ends of a\nvacuum vessel can be neglected entirely. As a consequence a steadily growing layer of\ncondensed gas may accumulate on the wall during machine operation. A complete description\nof the processes, which determine the gas density during an extended period of operation, must\ninclude the following processes:\nDesorption of strongly bound, chemisorbed molecules from the surface and from near-\nsurface layers of the vacuum chamber, described by a primary desorption coefficient.\nDesorption of weakly bound, physisorbed molecules from a surface layer of condensed\nmolecules, described by a recycling coefficient. Infact, a molecule which has been desorbed\nfrom its strongly bound state, as described by the primary desorption coefficient, may readily\nre-condense in a weakly bound state where it has a considerably higher desoption probability.\nThis \u2018recycling effect\u2019 of physisorbed molecules in a closed vacuum system depends strongly\non the surface density of cryosorbed molecules and may lead to a large increase of the volume\ndensity in the system.\nThe thermal equilibrium pressure between surface and volume gas densities which can be\ndescribed by an adsorption isotherm for the respective gas species. The sticking probability of\nmolecules depends on the surface coverage, on the characteristics of the surface and on\ntemperature.\nA further process included in this study is the cracking of condensed gas molecules\ntransforming one molecular species into one or more other species. For instance, CO2\nmolecules have been found to produce CO and O2. Due to this effect, the amount of condensed\nCO2 in the system will be reduced while, at the same time, the cracking of this species\nconstitutes an additional source of CO and O2.\n3Incorporating these physical processes into the previous model for the cryogenic vacuum\nsystem [1], the balance for each individual gas species, i, can be written as:\n\u000b \f iiieiiiiii\ni nCnnS\ndt\ndnV \u0010\u0010\u0010*\u000ec\u000e DFKK \u0006)(\n                                (1)\n\u000b \f *\u000ec\u0010\u0010 \n\u000eo\n\u0006)( mkiieiiii innSdt\ndsA NKD\n                                (2)\nwith:  n  the volume molecular density; s the surface molecular density; V the vacuum chamber\nvolume and A the vacuum chamber wall area. *\u0006  is the photon intensity; K  the primary photo-\ndesorption yield and  K ' is the recycling coefficient, Si  Av i \/ 4 gives the ideal wall pumping\nspeed, v i  is mean molecular speed for the gas i; and D  is the molecular sticking probability. ne\nis the thermal equilibrium gas density of the condensed gas. Furthermore, C represents the\ndistributed pumping speed, in the LHC provided by the pumping slots in the beam screen [2].\nThe effect of cracking of molecules is described by the parameters N iok\u000em (si )  is the\ncracking efficiency of type i molecules into type k and type m and Fi (s j )  describes the inverse\nprocess, the efficiency of producing type i molecules by cracking of the type j parent\nmolecules.  The two quantities F and N are connected through the relation:\nFi(sj )  ai, jN joi\u000en (s j) ,\ninvolving the coefficients ai,j .\nThe behaviour of the vacuum system of the LHC depends on many parameters of which\nnot all are known with sufficiently precision. It should be noted that most parameters in this\nmodel depend implicitly on the surface coverage. The limited amount of available experimental\ndata and the choices made for this study will be reviewed in Section 3.\nThe system equations (1) and (2) describe the two cases which are particularly relevant\nfor the LHC vacuum system: a bare cold bore tube, i.e. a beam pipe without a beam screen,\nand a cold bore which contains a beam screen with pumping holes. These two cases are\ncharacterised by the conditions C = 0 and C > 0 respectively. Since in this study one is not\nconcerned with the fast transient behaviour but rather in the slow evolution over many hours\nand even months of photon irradiation, the following approximations for a \u2018quasi-static\u2019\nvacuum system have been made:\ndni\ndt\n| 0\n  and  \ndsi\ndt\nz 0\n                                                     (3)\n4LHC cold bore without a beam screen\nThe gas density inside a long, cold vacuum system can be obtained by neglecting the gas\nflow towards both ends of the system. This approach approximates a \u2018closed system\u2019 which\nbecomes independent of boundary conditions and gives a uniform longitudinal density\ndistribution. With the assumption of a quasi-static system the gas density for each gas species\nis given by:\ne\nii\njiiii\ni nS\nss\nn \u000e\n*\u000e\u000e\n|\nD\nFKK \u0006)()(( '\nDue to the dependence of most of the parameters on the surface coverage, the gas\ndensity will slowly evolve during the exposure to SR. Furthermore, due to the cracking\nprocess, the different cryosorbed species are transformed from one type into another and their\npartial pressures become mutually interdependent.\nThe slowly changing surface density s(t) of the cryosorbed molecules can be computed\nstepwise starting from the initial status of the system:\n\u000b \f\u00b3\n \n*\u0010\u000e\u000e \nt\nt\niijiiii dtssA\nsts\n0\n)()(1)0()( \u0006NFK .\nA very general estimate of the maximum gas density in the system can be obtained by\nassuming that the recycling coefficient as well as the cracking yield of all gas species increase\nwith surface coverage until they reach their respective maximum values Kmax, Nmax and Fmax\n[3,4,5,6]. Then the density would have an upper bound:\nie\nii\nij\njiii\ni nS\ns\nn \u000e\n*\u00b8\n\u00b8\n\u00b9\n\u00b7\n\u00a8\n\u00a8\n\u00a9\n\u00a7\n\u000ec\u000e\nd\n\u00a6\nz\nD\nFKK \u0006)(maxmax\nIn the more specific case when there is no pre-condensed gas at the beginning of the SR\nirradiation one arrives at a slightly different estimate since in this case the rate of cracking of\nmolecules can never exceed the primary production rate and therefore\nN joi\u000e k  ai, jFi (sj ) d K j .

Defining the parameter ri, as the\nratio of the maximum of both, the recycling coefficient and of the cracking coefficient,\nri  cKi max \/N i max , one obtains the condition iiiiii rr KNKK   c\u001fc maxmax . With this\napproximation the gas density has the upper bound:\n\u000b \f\ne\nii\nii\ni nS\nr\n\u000e\n*\u000e\nd\nD\nK \u00061\nn .\nLHC cold bore with a beam screen\nThe configuration with a beam screen and pumping holes is characterised by C > 0,\nhence by a non-vanishing distributed pumping speed in addition to any wall pumping effect.\nThe quasi-static gas density in this system is given by:\n\u000b \f\niii\neiiiii\ni CS\nnS\nn\n\u000e\n\u000e*\u000ec\u000e\n \nD\nVFKK \u0006\nContrary to the situation with a bare cold bore, the gas density and the surface density on\nthe beam screen will always be limited by the distributed pumping C of the holes in the screen.\nThe surface density can be computed with the expression:\n\u000b \f> @\u00b3\n \n\u0010*\u0010\u000e\u000e \nt\nt\niijiiiiii dtnCssA\nsts\n0\n)()(1)0()( \u0006NFK\nUnder conditions where the thermal equilibrium density ne can be neglected, the slowly varying\ngas density can be expressed as:\n\u000b \f\ndt\nds\nC\nA\nC\ntn i\nii\niii\ni \u0010\n*\u0010\u000e\n \n\u0006NFK)( .\nDuring a long SR exposure the gas density will increase and when the surface coverage\nhas reached a constant value such that ds\ndt\n 0, which in turn implies a constant gas density\nindependent of the wall pumping speed, one obtains:\ni\niii\ni C\nn\n*\u0010\u000e\n \n\u0006)( NFK\n.\n6Since at this equilibrium N joi\u000e k  ai, jF i d K j , it has an upper limit\ni\nij ji\nj\ni\ni C\na\nn\n*\n\u00b8\n\u00b8\n\u00b9\n\u00b7\n\u00a8\n\u00a8\n\u00a9\n\u00a7\n\u000e\nd\n\u00a6\nz\n\u0006\n,\nK\nK\n and  for Kj = 0, it reduces to\ni\ni\ni C\nn\n*\nd\n\u0006K\nExperimental parameters\nPrimary desorption yield\nThe primary desorption yield, K\u000f and its variation with the accumulated photon dose, D,\nhas been studied at low temperature extensively by different experiments [1,2]. For a SR\nspectrum with a critical photon energy of about 50 eV a satisfactory parameterisation of the\ndesorption yield for a OFHC copper vacuum chamber and for grazing photon incidence, is\ngiven by\nK  Ko (Do D)0.33\nwhere K\u0013 is the photodesorption yield at the given photon dose Do . The temperature of the test\nchamber for these measurements was 78 K. Since experimental data only exist for a photon\ndose between 1019 to 1022 photons\/m, an extrapolation to a larger photon dose, e.g. for the\nLHC with a typical linear photon flux of 1017 photons\/(m\u0098s), has been obtained using the\nparameters in Table 1.\nTable 1. Primary photodesorption yield at 78 K and 10 K\nK\u000b\u001a\u001b .\f K\u000b\u0014\u0013 .\f K\u000b\u0014\u0013 .\t\u001a\u001b .\f\nGas\nspecies\nD=1019\nphotons\/m\nD=1019\nphotons\/m\nD=1024\nphotons\/m\nH2 2\u009810-3 4\u009810-4 5\u009810-5\nCH4 2\u009810-5 \u2014 9\u009810-7\nCO 2\u009810-4 \u2014 5\u009810-6\nCO2 3\u009810-5 \u2014 5\u009810-7\nIt should be noted that in the LHC a dose of 1024 photons\/m corresponds to\napproximately 4 months of continuous operation. Comparing the data for H2 at 78 K with\nmeasurements between 5 to 10 K, the initial desorption yield at 5 K is less by about a factor\nof 5, however, at a high accumulated photon dose the desorption yield seems to be less\ndependent on temperature [2].\n7Recycling and cracking of molecules\nMolecules condensed on a cryogenic surface may be desorbed by SR either as the\noriginal molecule, or may be cracked and subsequently form new species. In experiments,\nwhich reproduce the closed geometry of the LHC vacuum system, it has been possible to\nobserve only the compound quantity (K +Kc +F)\/D rather than the individual contributions,\nsince the wall pumping can not be neglected. From such a measurement the ratio Kc\/D for H2\nwas obtained and was found to increase with surface coverage and to saturate at a value of\nabout 0.5 H2 molecules\/photon for a coverage larger than 3\u00981015 molecules\/cm2 [3,4]. For\nCH4, CO and CO2 only an upper limit could be deduced [4]:\n(K+Kc)\/D | 10-3 molecules\/photon.\nMore recent experiments, which were performed in an \u2018open geometry\u2019 set-up [5,6],\ncircumvent the problem of re-condensation of molecules and hence do not require the\nknowledge of the sticking probability D. With this experiment the \u2018removal coefficient\u2019 cKr , i.e.\nthe number of pre-condensed molecules desorbed per incident photon, was measured for H2,\nCH4, CO and CO2 in a temperature range from ~3 K for H2 up to 68 K for CO2. The removal\ncoefficient was found to increase with surface coverage and to reach a saturation value of 0.55\nmolecules\/photon for H2 at 3\u00981015 molecules\/cm2. The saturation values for CH4, CO and CO2\nwere found to be 0.45, 0.4 and 0.04 molecules\/photon at a surface coverage of ~1019\nmolecules\/cm2. Since the removal coefficient includes both, desorption and cracking of\nmolecules, it corresponds to cKr  cK \u000e N . Nevertheless, since the pre-condensed gas species is\nknown in this experiment, it is possible to deduce the ratio cK \/N  from the partial pressures of\na newly appearing species. The main findings of this experiment have been that the desorption\nof a thick  layer of condensed CO2 and CH4, equivalent to many hundred monolayers, involves\npredominantly cracking of these molecules, e.g.:\ncKr(CO2 ) \u009f cK(CO2 ) \u000eN CO2 oCO\u000eO   and  cKr(CH4 ) \u009f cK(CH4 ) \u000eNCH 4o2H 2 \u000eC .\nThe cracking process has been found to exceed the desorption (recycling) rate of these\nmolecules by a factor of 10. No dependence on temperature could be observed in the range\nfrom 3 K to 20 K for H2 and up to 68 K for CO2. To estimate the parameters for these two gas\nspecies one may assume that, e.g. cracking of CO2 generates one molecule of CO and one\natom of O, hence\nFCO (sCO2 )  NCO2 oCO\u000eO   and FO2 (sCO2 )  0.5N CO2 oCO\u000eO .\nSimilarly, cracking of CH4 would produce two H2 molecules and one C, hence\n8FH 2 (sCH4 )  2N CH4 o 2H 2 \u000eC  and FC (sCH 4 )  N CH4 o 2H 2 \u000eC .\nFinally, it may be necessary to include the process:\nCH 4 \u000e CO2 \u009f 2H2 \u000e 2CO ,\nwhich would imply :\nFCO (sCO2 \u000e sCH4 )  N CO2 oCO\u000eO \u000eNCH 4o2H 2 \u000eC .\nIn a cryogenic vacuum system H2, CH4, CO and CO2 represent the main species which\nare desorbed by SR and two of them may be cracked by photons to form new molecules, e.g. :\nCH4 \u009fC\u000e 2H2   and  2CO2 \u009f 2CO \u000eO2 .\nAs a consequence, an additional source of H2, CO and O2 appears in the vacuum\nsystem. Since in practice KCO2 |KCH 4  one may assume that a sufficient amount of these\nmolecules are produced such that the overall process\nk1CH4 \u000ek2CO2 \u009f2k1H2 \u000e (k1 \u000ek2 )CO\u000e\nk2\n2\n\u0010k1\n\u00a7\n\u00a9\n\u00a8\n\u00b7\n\u00b9\n\u00b8O2\nis well balanced.

The sticking probability for H2 on a beam screen with a\nstainless steel or a copper coated surface in the temperature range from 4.2 to 11 K was found\nto lay between 0.01 to 0.6 [1,2]. The sticking probability for CO under similar conditions is not\nknown but may be expected to fall in the same range. Measurements of the sticking probability\nfor CO2 [4] indicate a sticking probability of 10-4 on a bare copper surface at ~77 K. However,\nwith an increasing amount of pre-condensed CO2 the sticking probability was found to increase\nand to approach unity as observed for hydrogen.\nDynamic gas density in the LHC\nVacuum system with a beam screen\nFor the LHC vacuum system with a beam screen there is a minimum net pumping speed\nby the pumping slots independent of the sticking probability of molecules on the surface of the\nbeam screen. Assuming that the thermal vapour pressure of the gas species concerned always\nremains sufficiently low that it can be neglected with respect to the SR induced dynamic\npressure, the upper limits of the gas densities for H2 , CO and O2 can be estimated from the\nexpressions :\n2\n42\n2\n)2(\nH\nCHH\nH C\nn\n*\u000e\nd\n\u0006KK\nCO\nCHCOCO\nCO C\nn\n*\u000e\u000e\nd\n\u0006)(\n42\nKKK\n2\n2\n2\n5.0\nO\nCO\nO C\nn\n*\nd\n\u0006K\n.\nSimilarly the gas density for CH4 and CO2 may be derived from the expressions:\n\u000b \f\n444\n44\n4\n1\nCHCH\nCHCH\nCH CS\nr\nn\nCH\n\u000e\n*\u000e\nd\nV\nK \u0006\n\u000b \f\n244\n22\n2\n1\nCOCH\nCOCO\nCO CS\nr\nn\nCH\n\u000e\n*\u000e\nd\nV\nK \u0006\n .\nwhere by r is the ratio ri  cKi max \/N i max  .

At 1.9 K the\nsaturated vapour pressure of all gases including hydrogen can be neglected, while at the\ntemperature of the beam screen the saturated vapour pressure of hydrogen is very large, which\nimplies that only a negligible amount of H2 can be cryosorbed at this temperature. The assumed\nphoton flux is 1017 photons\/(sec\u0098m) corresponding to \u2018nominal' operating conditions of the\nLHC. The evolution of the gas density of the surface coverage and of the recycling coefficient\nas a function of the accumulated photon dose are shown in Figures 1, 2 and 3. Here it has been\nassumed that the sticking probabilities are 0.5 for H2 and ~1 for all other gases. It can be seen\nthat the dynamic vacuum is rather sensitive to the effect of cracking of CH4 and of CO2.\nFurthermore, the surface coverage for these gases is limited by the cracking.\nFigure 1 illustrates that at the relatively low temperature of 5 K, the H2 density\nincreases to a maximum value after about 15-20 minutes of irradiation and decreases for\nfurther irradiation. The initial increase is due to the finite pumping capacity of the beam screen\nand the maximum is reached when the secondary desorption yield is compensated by the wall\npumping speed and the surface coverage reaches its maximum, see Figure 3.\nThe evolution of the gas density for CH4 and CO2 is maximum at the start of irradiation and\ndecreases as a function of accumulated dose due to photon scrubbing. The surface coverage is\nlimited by cracking and the secondary desorption of these gases is negligible.\nIt is interesting to observe in Figure 1 that the density of CO initially decreases due to\nthe photon scrubbing of the surface. However, from a photon dose of about 1022 photons\/m\nonwards it increases again because of the additional contribution from cracking which in turn\n11\nincreases the surface coverage and results in a higher recycling rate.  Nevertheless, since the\nrecycling coefficient for CO remains relatively low up to a rather high surface coverage of\nmany 1000 monolayers the gas density does not reach a saturation level even at an\naccumulated photon dose of 1024 photons\/m. This dose corresponds to approximately four\nmonths of LHC operation.\nFigure 1.

This criterion\ndefines a \u2018lifetime limit\u2019 and a minimum beam lifetime in the LHC [4]. The tolerable losses\nbudget of 0.1 W\/m correspond to an average hydrogen density of 1015 molecules\/m3. For\nheavier molecules this density has to be divided by a factor 5.4 for CH4, 7.8 for CO and 12.2\nfor CO2.  Figure 4 shows the total equivalent H2 density as a function of the photon exposure.\nIt can be seen that the lifetime limit of will not be reached even after many months of LHC\noperation.\nFigure 4. Hydrogen equivalent gas density with respect to the lifetime limit\nConclusions\nIn this study the dominant vacuum processes in a vacuum chamber with cryosorbing walls and\nexposed to synchrotron radiation have been studied based on the most reliable experimental\nparameters available. With respect to the cryogenic vacuum system of the LHC with its beam\nscreen, it can be shown that the dominant gas species are H2 and CO. Due to the pumping slots\nni\nDi\n1 1018 1 1019 1 1020 1 1021 1 1022 1 1023 1 1024\n1 1013\n1 1014\n1 1015\nAccumulated photon dose, [photons\/m]\nG\nas\n d\nen\nsit\ny,\n [m\nole\ncu\nles\n\/m\n3]\n.\n14\nin the beam screen, there is a continuous transfer of molecules from the inside of the beam\nscreen to the outer cold bore surface where all molecules can be cryosorbed permanently and\nwith a negligible vapour pressure.\nThe amount of cryosorbed molecules of CH4, O2 and CO2 is limited due to the combined\neffects of recycling and cracking of these molecules by SR. The surface coverage of CO will\nincrease steadily during the LHC operation since its recycling coefficient is rather small. CO\nwill therefore accumulate until the system is warmed up and this gas can be removed by\nexternal pumps. During warm up after a long period of operation the main gases to be pumped\nwill be H2, CO and perhaps O2.\nThis study also confirms that the total gas density inside that vacuum system will remain below\nthe beam lifetime limit also when considering the effect of cracking, except in the unrealistic\ncase of a very thick pre-condensed layer of CO or CO2.\nReferences:\n                                                       \n1.
