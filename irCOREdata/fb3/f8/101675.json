A number \nof developed countries have demonstrated clear leadership in eCommerce, as \ndemonstrated by the level of ICT penetration in organisations and households. However, \ntraditional economies have experienced a much slower uptake of eCommerce. This is \nattributed to difficulties in enhancing the usage of personal computers and in increasing \nthe utilisation of the Internet and Information Communications Technologies (ICTs) \nthroughout their production mechanisms. This paper concentrates on Greece and \ndemonstrates a number of indicators that synthesise the level of eCommerce \npenetration. The Greek economy is going through a major transformation and ICTs may \nbe instrumental in its international competitiveness. The paper provides a \ncomprehensive overview from both the production\/supply (macro and micro) and \nconsumption\/demand sides. It focuses on the level of ICT penetration in Small and \nMedium-Sized Enterprises and concludes that eCommerce in Greece is still in its infancy. \nThe paper provides essential background information for enterprises and policy makers \ninterested in eCommerce in Greece and the competitiveness of the country in general. \n \nKeywords: Internet, eCommerce, Greece, Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises, SMEs \n \n1. Introduction \n \nThe origins of e-commerce can be traced back to  electronic funds transfer in the 1970s \nand EDI in the 1980s. However, electronic commerce (eCommerce) emerged following \nthe proliferation of the Internet in the late 1990s. The networked economy enabled \ntransactions around the world and empowered organisations to collaborate virtually \n(Kalakota and Whinston, 1997; Timmers, 1999; Kalakota and Robinson, 2001; Turban et \nal, 2002). Gradually eCommerce diminishes national boundaries and internationalises \ntrade off of products and services (Leontiades, 2001). Although the potential is there for \nall to explore, it is the more developed  countries and the larger organisations that have \nthe expertise and resources to invest and harness Internet benefits. Indeed, the vast \nmajority of the world\u2019s population does not have access to the Internet and lacks \ntechnological skills and knowledge. Several countries struggle to increase Internet and \nelectronic commerce utilisation, generating a digital divide (Seyal, Rahim and Rahman, \n2000; Cawkell, 2001; Bucy, 2000).  \n \nHowever, a number of innovative small organisations, led by determined entrepreneurs, \nhave demonstrated that with a minimal investment they can compete on an equal \nfooting with larger organisations. Less wealthy regions and nations, such as India and \nMalaysia, gradually use the Internet to educate the young and to gain access to learning \nresources only available to economically privileged societies (Leontiades, 2001). This can \ncontribute to their competitiveness and support their economic development, especially \nwhen innovation is driving these processes (Porter, 1990). \n \nThis paper examines the Internet usage and eCommerce penetration in Greece within a \nglobal perspective. It illustrates that the Greek economy is going through major \ntransformation and that this is reflected on the use of ICTs and eCommerce for both the \nproduction\/supply (macro and micro) and consumption\/demand sides by synthesising \npublished research. The paper focuses on the Small and Medium-sized Enterprises \n2(SMEs), as they dominate the local economy (Anonymous, 2002) whilst it explores the \nICT and eCommerce policies in Greece. Although the paper does not present results \ngenerated by primary research, it brings together reliable information from a wide range \nof resources. It clearly demonstrates that eCommerce is gradually spreading in most \ndeveloped countries, expanding the established opportunities evident in the USA and \nScandinavian countries.  \n \nThe paper examines the generic level of Internet and eCommerce penetration. The \nresults are useful for policymakers at the National and European Union level, as well as \nfor private organisations planning to expand their operations in Greece or to develop \neCommerce applications. The results are also useful for researchers investigating ICT \npenetration and eCommerce progress in developed European countries, as similar \npatterns can be observed in many countries of Southern Europe. The paper initially \nprovides a contextual and theoretical background, demonstrating eCommerce \ndevelopments within the context of the Greek economy. It then provides a brief \nmethodology before demonstrating the Internet penetration from the \nconsumption\/demand side. Suitable comparisons are made with other European and \nInternational markets. The supply\/demand side focuses on the adoption of the Internet \nin SMEs. This paper concludes by examining policies and practices in Greece and the \nEuropean Union that Internet penetration and eCommerce can enhance the local \neconomy. \n \n2 Research Methodology  \n \nThis paper aims to bring together research results published on the area of eCommerce \nin Greece, from both the production\/supply and consumption\/demand sides. It provides \na contextual and theoretical background and it synthesises secondary data in order to \nprovide a comprehensive overview. This enables an understanding of the current \nsituation and provides a solid base for future research. Churchill (1991) explains that \nsecondary data \u2018not only helps the researcher to formulate and understand the research \nproblem better, but also broadens the basis for which specific conclusions can be drawn\u2019.  \n \nThe research used a range of resources both on-line and off-line. A number of libraries \nwere used both in the UK and Greece. The areas researched included eCommerce and \neBusiness as well as issues related to the policy, economy and development of Greece. \nThe Internet proved valuable source for gathering  secondary data on ICT and \neCommerce penetration on a global basis.  \n \nIn essence the contribution of this paper is to bring together a number of indicators and \nstatistics that clearly demonstrate where eCommerce in Greece is currently, and to \nexplore the key factors that will determine its future. This would enable policymakers \nand investors to make informed decisions for the level of eCommerce in Greece and to \ndecide suitable actions for achieving their objectives.  \n \n3. eCommerce and Greece: contextualising the industrial and market \nenvironment \n \nThe Internet has revolutionised the way businesses operate and propelled eCommerce \non a global basis. eBusiness impacts all areas of daily business routine and strategy. \nOnly organisations that use innovative ICT tools will be able to enhance their competitive \nadvantage. Gloor (2000) demonstrates that businesses that embrace eBusiness and \neCommerce properly can: \n3\u2022 Increase revenue through opening new and cost effective sales channels and \nmarkets \n\u2022 Reduce costs by designing efficient processes and production mechanisms, as well as \nby optimising their logistics and sales \n\u2022 Enhance customer retention, through user profiling and product personalisation by \nusing sophisticated Customer Relationship Management techniques and software \n\u2022 Improve image and brand awareness, through accessing consumers directly and \ndemonstrating a competitive and dynamic profile \n\u2022 Keep up with competition and maximise return on investment \n \nA number of new entities have emerged to facilitate electronic intermediation. Although \nearly research suggested that eCommerce can decrease costs for buyers and sellers, \nthrough the elimination of intermediaries from electronic value chains (Jin et al, 1999; \nPalvia et al, 1999) this has not materialised. Giaglis et al (2002) suggest that \nintermediaries provide value-adding functions that cannot be easily substituted through \ndirect supplier-buyer dealings, and hence mediating parties continue to play a significant \nrole in the eCommerce world. \n \n3.1 eCommerce and eBusiness Developments: Global Perspectives \n \nDespite the burst in the dot.com bubble that took place in early 2000s, as a result of \nunrealistic expectations and unproven business models, eCommerce is growing fast. In \nmost developed economies there is a shift from off-line expenditure, banking and \nshopping to online, especially for goods and services, where information is critical and \nwhere the actual delivery of products is manageable. Consumer electronics, PCs and \nentertainment products (books, videos and DVDs and music) are the largest retail \ncategories, whilst travel products and airline tickets grow at a fast pace. Jupiter forecasts \nthat online retail spending in the USA will grow by 28% in 2003 to USD52 billion. By \n2007, online retail spending will reach USD105 billion and account for 5% of all US retail \nspending, whilst the Internet will influence 34% of all US retail spending. Jupiter \nestimates that online retail will increase at an average annual growth rate of 21% \nbetween 2002 and 2007. In Europe, although the growth of the Internet population has \nreached its plateau level, online shoppers have rapidly increased from 36 million in 2001 \nto 52 million by the end of 2002. The eCommerce investments that innovative retailers \nhave made are beginning to pay\u2013off, as Internet users gain the confidence to start \nshopping online. The United Kingdom is the more mature market in terms of shopping \nonline, followed by Germany (Jupiter, 2003). \n \nThe Internet provides unprecedented opportunities for innovative SMEs as it provides \nadequate tools to communicate and interact globally. In particular, SMEs that \nconcentrate on services, such as consultants, editors, graphics designers, accountants, \nprogrammers etc are liberated to access the global marketplace regardless of their \nlocation. This has driven many companies to use the Internet to establish business-to-\nbusiness transactions. However, the Internet also brings challenges for SMEs. Research \ndemonstrates that initial investment, operational costs, communication standards, \nconnectivity, and accessibility have a positive influence on the adoption decision. \nHowever, data-security concerns, network reliability, and bandwidth have a negative \ninfluence (Soliman, 2003). Saban (2001) proposes that strategically prepared companies \nand regions are in a better position to maximise their eCommerce investments than \ncompanies who are just tactically prepared. \n \n43.2 Greek economy transformation and modernisation  \n \nThe post second-world-war decline of the Greek economy is attributed to a systematic \nfall in investment, deterioration and inadequacy of infrastructure, low productivity and \nlack of technological adoption, which was generated by the lack of skills and training \n(Konsolas, 2002). The seven years of the dictatorship (1967-1974), which ended with \nthe Turkish invasion to Cyprus, in combination with the international energy crisis and \nthe increasing openness of the European and world competition in the 1980s, challenged \nthe Greek economy\u2019s competitiveness and raised inflation, unemployment and low \ngrowth rates (Christodoulakis and Kalyvitis, 2001). However, since the early 1990s \nGreece has been going through a major transformation that affected its economy, \npolitics and government due to several reasons, including: European Union membership \nand investment, political stability, internationalisation and gradual rationalisation of both \nthe public and private sectors contributed towards this development (Economist, 2002; \nPapademos, 2002). Regional development and Community Support Framework funds by \nthe European Union enabled the Greek government to invest in major infrastructure. In \naddition, a number of major public works were initiated for the Athens 2004 Olympic \nGames.  These major investments, in combination with joining the European Economic \nand Monetary Union (EMU) in January 2001 and adopting the \u20acuro forced the Greek \neconomy, Government and politics, to converge with other European countries (Business \nIntelligence Report 2001; Dalamagas, 2000). The GDP rate of growth exceeded 4% in \nboth 2000 and 2001, well above the European average.  \n \nThe growth rates of the Greek economy owe their rapid increase to falling interest rates \nand increases in private sector financing (Ministry of Economics,2002). Greece is a \ncountry without heavy industry. Hence, it concentrates its efforts to the production and \nexport of special products of industry, agriculture, tourism and services. The industry \ncontinues its modernisation, especially in some sectors such as cement, aluminium \nproducts, textile, food-beverages, construction as well as tourism and hospitality. A \nnumber of sources of competitive advantage can be identified and exploited further for \nthe development of the economy (Konsolas, 2002). Until recently the Greek private \nsector has almost exclusively been characterised by SMEs and mainly micro enterprises. \nThe opening up of the borders with the European Union however has introduced larger \norganisations investing in Greek enterprises or going through mergers and acquisitions \n(Spanos et al, 2001; Makridakis, et al, 1997). Nevertheless the vast majority of the local \nenterprises are small and family owned. Voudouris et al, (2000) have identified that \nsuccessful Greek SMEs take advantage of a number of success factors, including: intense \nspecialisation in narrowly defined market segments; commitment to customer service; \ninnovative culture and adaptation to new technologies; strong leadership and a healthy \norganisational climate.  \n \n3.3 Greece, eBusiness, eCommerce and the Information Society \n \nTechnology adoption in Greece has always been problematic in both private and public \norganisations (Cohen, 2001; Vlahos et al 1995; Tatsiopoulos, et al, 2002). The Internet \nutilisation in Greece is limited, particularly by micro and smaller enterprises. Medium and \nlarger organisations inevitably use more technological solutions for their operations and \nhave adopted the Internet widely. A number of Greek portals have also emerged \nrecently, including: in.gr, yahoo.gr otenet.gr and flash.gr focusing on news and \ntelecommunication products.  \n \n5Many large Greek businesses (more than 500 employees) have already adopted \neCommerce and demonstrated that:  \n\u0001 An average of 38% of large companies use electronic commerce practices; 12.5% \nintegrated to their business and the rest 25.5% are opportunistic. \n\u0001 47% of the companies are planning to adopt electronic commerce, while 33% of \nthose are planning to do so within the next year. \n\u0001 Some sectors in the Greek market are more advanced than others. Naturally the IT \nsector uses integrated eCommerce practices by 22% (against 12.5% of the average) \nand 58% in total (integrated and opportunistic use). \n\u0001 Retailing, financial, mass media, mobile telephony are preparing for integrating their \nservices fully and maximising their electronic commerce adoption. \n(Papazafeiropoulou et al, 2001) \n \nThe public sector utilisation of the Internet is in its infancy though. Apart from the TAXIS \nsystems, which gives taxpayers the possibility to submit their VAT declarations and to \npay their debts electronically, there are little other established eGovernment initiatives. A \nnumber of emerging projects are supported by the European Union. Gradually all the \nofficial organisations will develop a web site, including the Prime Minister \n(www.primeminister.gr) with links to all ministries and public organisations. \n \nIn 2002, the government published an Information Society White Paper and developed a \ncomprehensive programme to penetrate all levels of government. This programme aims \nto use ICTs as a tool for an open and effective government and for supporting \ncompetitiveness (Papazafeiropoulou et al, 2002). It also aims to use ICTs to improve \nquality of life for citizens, to enhance health, transport and environmental services, and \nto promote the Greek cultural heritage language. The government also follows the \neEurope initiatives and participates in European Union projects for the digitisation of the \npublic sector (Information Society, 2002).  \n \nThe theoretical context of diffusion of innovation, as introduced by Rogers (1995, 1976) \ncan also be observed at the macro\/national level in Greece. The vast majority of the \nplayers are either at the Laggard or Late Majority adoption stages. Only few innovative \nplayers are on early adoption stage. Greece as a whole therefore is a late adopter and \nideally should learn from mistakes by other nations and take advantage to advance \nfaster. Failure to do will have major implications for its collective competitiveness. \n \n4. Internet penetration and eCommerce: consumption\/demand side  \n \nThe dynamic nature of the Internet prevents research organisations from illustrating \naccurate statistics. It is more important therefore to observe trends and relationships in \nthese figures, rather than absolute numbers. The Internet revolutionises consumer choice \nand service-delivery processes. Increasingly customers have become more sophisticated \nand discerning, experiencing high levels of service. Consumers in developed countries \nincreasingly rely heavily on electronic media to obtain information about products and \nservices, and to communicate their needs and wishes to suppliers rapidly. They become \ndemanding, requesting high quality products as well as value for money and time. The \nlevel of online penetration in Greece and globally determine the level of eCommerce, as \nit is consumer demand that motivates organisations to develop their online presence and \nto instigate online transactions. Global indicators illustrate the level of potential \ninternational demand for exports and the key markets. Greek indicators can demonstrate \nthe diffusion of ICTs in society and therefore the ability of consumers, employees and \norganisations to appreciate the potential of technology.  \n64.1 Worldwide Internet penetration \n \nThere has been a plethora of statistics estimating how many people are online \nthroughout the world. However, most of these statistics are rough estimates at best. \nNua.com is an authoritative online source for information on Internet demographics and \ntrends. On September 2002 they estimated that the total number of people online was \n605 million people. According to a survey conducted by the Meta Group, the highest \nInternet \u2018maturity\u2019 level and the highest eCommerce development potential is found in \nthe countries with mature economies, such as United-States, Canada, the Netherlands, \nFinland, Iceland, Sweden, Denmark, Ireland, New Zealand and Australia (Carlton, 2001). \nThe Meta group based its different criteria on the number of online financial transactions \nthat were generated, the education level of the populations concerned and also the \ntechnological sophistication of said countries. The survey made a clear distinction \nbetween northern and southern European countries, indicating that counties such as \nGreat Britain, Ireland and Germany have an Internet potential that proves much higher \nthan countries such as Spain, Portugal or Greece (Carlton, 2001). This is due to their \nhigher levels of technological sophistication as well as to computer ownership and \nInternet connections. The percentage of Internet users in European countries is \npresented in Figure 1.  \n \nFigure 1  Internet Users in European Countries (percentage) \nSource: Oertel, Liong Thio and Feil, 2001:237 \n \n4.2 Internet and PC usage growth by the Greek population  \n \nThe Greek population has been much slower in Internet adoption, in comparison to \nNorthern European countries. However, Greece has demonstrated a fast and steady \ngrowth (Papazafeiropoulou, Pouloudi and Doukidis, 2001). The most recent pan-hellenic \n7research into the use of computers, the Internet and mobile telephone usage was \nrecently presented by the Ministry of Development. The research was based on the \nlargest sample ever collected in Greece (6,095 individuals aged over 15 years) (Karounos \nand Goussiou, 2001). The main conclusions emerged from the research are outlined and \nexplained in the following paragraphs. \n \nDuring 2001, 50% of all Greeks used mobile phones, 20% used a personal computer \n(PC) and 10% used the Internet. Internet penetration for the first time passed 10% of \nthe population (over 15 years of age) at the end of the first half of 2001 and it was \nexpected to exceed 12% by the end of 2001 (CORDIS, 2002). Results from the \nEuropean Union Eurobarometer 2001 Survey conducted during the last weeks of \nFebruary 2001 confirmed that 12.9% of the population were online in Greece \n(eMarketer, 2001). Authoritative specialist international firms had forecasted that Greece \nwould reach this level by 2004 (McMahon, 2002). This growth can be attributed primarily \nto the dramatic increase of computers used in schools and throughout the education \nsystem. The number of computers per student ratio has been increased dramatically and \npupils in secondary schools are trained on computers and then acquire them for home to \nfacilitate their homework.  \n \nGradually ICTs have penetrated all businesses, as SMEs are subsidised to purchase \ncomputers, to train their staff and develop their web presence. As a result, a large \nproportion of new Internet users has recently emerged, with 75% starting to use the \nInternet during the last two years. These programmes are partly financed by the \nEuropean Commission Information Society, through an 2.8 billion Euro investment and \ndevelopment project that was approved in March 2001 (Ministry of Education, 2002). \n \nResults concerning Internet usage patterns reveal that 35% of the Greek users access \nthe network on a daily basis, 27% one or two times a week, while a further 13% on an \noccasional basis. Their main incentive of using the Internet is to access information \n(53%); use of email (23%) and for entertainment (12%). About 30% of those who have \nnot personally subscribed to the Internet have access at work or in school, while 20% \nclaimed it is too expensive and 13% do not own a PC. Greek users are accessing the \nInternet less for education (5%), purchasing (2%) and banking (1%) (CORDIS, 2002; \nBraliev and Yatromalakis, 2002). \n \n4.3 Internet and PC usage by groups and segments of the Greek population \n \nPenetration rates show significant differences amongst population segments. PC and \nInternet penetration is significantly higher for people between 15 and24 years of age \n(Figure 2). One in two (50%) young people use a PC and one in four (25%) use the \nInternet. At the beginning of the school period 1999-2000, the proportion of secondary \nschools that were connected to Internet was 18%, while the proportion of the connected \nelementary schools was negligible (1%). By the end of 2001, more than 81% of the \nsecondary schools were connected to the Internet, as well as 16% of the elementary \nschools. It is expected that all schools will be connected by the end of 2002. A strong \npredisposition has been found both for the purchase of personal computers, as well as \nfor connecting to the Internet. Young people would like to do their homework online, as \nwell as to download music and communicate through email (Braliev and Yatromalakis, \n2002). This trend is encouraging as younger people will soon be entering the labour \nmarket and will be forcing ICT adoption for both personal and professional use. \n \n8Figure 2  Greek PC and Internet usage by age group \n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n15-17 18-24 25-34 35-44 45-54 55-64 >65\nPC use Internet use\nSource: Karounos and Goussiou, 2001:11 \n \nThe level of education, therefore, is a basic determining factor for the adoption of \npersonal computers and the Internet. About 34% of individuals with higher education \nlevel use the Internet, while the corresponding ratio for those with elementary education \nis only 1% (Figure 3). The large percentage of the population  with lower education \n(37%), of which 86% belong in age groups of over 45 years old, indicates that at \npresent there is a structural restraining factor on Internet growth. Hence, an \nimprovement of the educational level is expected to reduce the digital divide (CORDIS, \n2002).  \n \nFigure 3  PC and Internet use by education group \n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\nEle\nme\nnta\nry\n< g\nrad\ne h\nigh\nsch\nool\n3 g\nrad\ne h\nigh\nsch\nool\n6 g\nrad\ne h\nigh\nsch\nool\nTec\nhni\ncal\nsch\nool\nTec\nhno\nlog\nical\ninst\nitut\ne\nUni\nver\nsity\nStu\nden\nts\nPC use Internet use\nSource: Karounos and Goussiou, 2001:11 \n \nFigure 4 illustrates the difference amongst Greece and the European Union in terms of \nInternet penetration. Greece is still noticeably behind the European Union mean in \nrespect of personal computer and Internet use (Braliev and Yatromalakis, 2002). \nHowever, if the same rate of growth is maintained, then it is estimated that by the end \nof 2004 Internet penetration in Greece will reach between 50% and 68%, against the \nEuropean Union mean of 66% achieving convergence in this area. These estimates have \nbeen based on two different scenarios relative to the mode of Internet growth. The first \nscenario assumes that a constant growth rate will be maintained, where the second is \nbased on exponential rates, equivalent to those experienced by the mobile market in \nGreece during its launch years.  \n \n9Figure 4  Internet use in Greece and the European Union  \n20%\n25.70%\n34.30%\n66%\n49.40%\n67.50%\n5.50% 7.30% 10.10%\n1999 2000 2001 2004\nEU Average\nGreece\nGreece,\nEstimate 1\nGreece,\nEstimate 2\nSource: Karounos and Goussiou, 2001:10 \n4.4 Mobile Phone Adoption by the Greek Population  \n \nThe penetration of mobile telephony in Greece is comparably high and close to the \nEuropean average. EETR (2001) illustrates that the Greek telecommunications market is \none of the most dynamic and profitable in Europe. The market capitalisation of the \nGreek telecommunication industry is valued at EURO 4.3 billion, with the mobile market \nbeing valued at EURO 1.5 billion. There are currently three mobile telecom operators: \nPanafon-Vodafone, CosmOTE, and STET Hellas. The mobile penetration ratio in Greece \nwas 56% at the end of 2000, with a forecast to exceed 80% by 2004. Greek subscribers \nchange their cellular handsets three times more often than their European counterparts \nand half of the mobile users change their handsets yearly. Greece has significant SMS \npenetration rates, whilst roaming contributes to a significant percentage of the mobile \noperators\u2019 revenue stream. \n \nGreeks use mobile phones habitually and a high degree of penetration can be attributed \nto several factors. Firstly, access to fixed line telephony was limited, until the early \n1990s. Consumers and organisations were on waiting lists for years before a fixed line \nwas installed. The private mobile networks revolutionised the telecommunications \nindustry and provided phones instantly. Secondly, Greeks spend a lot of time away from \nhome and socialise outdoors intensively, making the mobile phone an invaluable tool for \ncommunications. Thirdly as most transactions are based on social interactions, through \npersonal and family networks, mobile phones have supported commercial activities. \nFourthly the innovation factor of mobile technology made phones fashion items, often \nwith customised and personalised ring tones. Finally, the introduction of the mobile \nphones enabled younger members of the family to have a personal and confidential \ncommunication line, in contrast to often family-controlled fixed line phones. As wireless \nand 3G technology are emerging fast, there are predictions that the Greek population \nmay reach Northern European levels (Karounos, Goussiou, 2001). This is because of the \nability of all age and education-level groups to use mobile phones and services.   \n \nHowever, the prospect of mobile Internet in Greece is distant, as Greeks primarily use \ntheir mobiles for voice communication, rather than data exchange. Similarly to other \ncountries, the Greek public was not very keen on using mobile Internet services or WAP, \nas data access via mobile telephones still confronts technical difficulties, delays and high \ncosts. Therefore, the growth of Internet usage should not be necessarily connected with \nthe fast penetration of mobile telephony. \n10 \n \n4.4 eCommerce and online purchasing developments in Greece: \nconsumption\/demand side \n \nDespite the rapid growth of Internet usage in the last few years, eCommerce in Greece \nis still in its infancy and presents a delay of five years in relation to main European \nmarkets. Consumer eCommerce remains largely embryonic and only 12% of Internet \nusers or 3.5% of the Greek population buy products online. This is one of the lowest \nrankings in Europe, as the number of European Internet users that buy online exceeds \n50%. In Greece, eCommerce as a ratio to the total volume of sales is only 0.024%, in \ncomparison with 0.1% in more technological advanced countries, such as France and \nGermany, and 0.4% in the USA (Stat Bank, 2002). A number of factors were identified \nas the main barriers for eCommerce transactions for Greek consumers, namely:  \n\u0001 25% Lack of access to credit card  \n\u0001 23% Lack of Internet transactions trust  \n\u0001 21% Lack of knowledge\/skills  \n\u0001 19% Prefer talking to salesmen prior to purchase  \n\u0001 12% are undecided \n \nSeveral socio-cultural issues also explain the low level of eCommerce in Greece. \nConsumers in Mediterranean countries tend to approach their purchasing process as a \nform of social exchange and interaction (Jin and Robey, 1999). Purchasing and going to \nthe market is a social event. People often have a network of regular suppliers for goods \nand services and transactions are often extended to or supported by social interactions \nor family relationships. Products and services are frequently customised to individual \npreferences, whilst pricing is often adjusted at the point of sales according to the type of \nrelationship. The language barrier and the possession of credit cards or chequebooks \nmake online purchases difficult. Suppliers on the Internet are often regarded as rigid, \ndistant and lifeless, whilst lack of trust, flexibility and personalisation are major \ndisadvantages.  \n \nHowever, increasingly Greeks use the Internet for data collection and for some particular \nproducts which consumers may be embarrassed to purchase offline and prefer a certain \ndegree of anonymity. In addition, educated users are using the Internet to research \nfacts or technical information for products. Although it is very likely that purchasing will \nbe completed over the phone or by visiting a retailer, both manufacturers and retailers \ncan gain significant benefits by influencing the research phase. Despite the low \npenetration of electronic trade in Greece, it is worth noting that a number of companies \nundertake important investments in ICTs and eCommerce (Stat Bank, 2002). \n \n5. Patterns of Internet usage by Greek enterprises: supply\/production side \n \nAs the consumption\/demand side seems unprepared to move towards eCommerce, the \nproduction\/supply side is also moving at a relatively slow pace. The third pan-hellenic \nresearch for the patterns of Internet used by enterprises concluded that the majority of \nGreek enterprises (60%) use the network on a daily basis, as indicated in Figure 5. The \nmain reasons for accessing the Internet by Greek enterprises is for information (94.6%) \nand communication (91.6%) (Technowatch, 2002). Only a very small percentage \n(27.7%) make purchases via the Web (Epitidios, 2002). The most frequent services \noffered in the web pages of Greek businesses include: \n \n11 \n \no Enterprise information 96%  \no Contact information 92% and \no Lists of products or services 88% \n \nFigure 5  Frequency of Internet Services by Greek enterprises \n60%18%\n14%\n4% 4%\nOn a daily base\nQuite frequently\nSometimes\nInfrequently\nHardly ever\nSource: Technowatch, 2002 \n \nMore than half of the Greek online enterprises (53%) offer a choice of language, usually \nGreek and English, aiming to attract international audiences and clientele. Whilst 30% of \nenterprises offer the possibility to place orders online, only 9.5% accept online \npayments, completing transactions off-line. Greece remains relatively unequipped for \nonline transactions, as shown in Figure 6. Only 6.5% of the host servers are secure, \nallowing users to encrypt information, such as credit card data (eMarketer, 2001). This is \ncompared with almost 30% of the European Union servers.  \n \nFigure 6: Secure servers in Greece and the EU 2000  \n6.50%\n29.10%\nGreece\nEuropean Union\nSource: eMarketer, 2001; Cohen, 2001 \n \n5.1 ICT use by Greek SMEs \n \nSMEs are very important for the Greek and European economies, as they represent more \nthan 99% of total enterprises. However their importance in the economy is not always \nsupported by their use of e-business tools. When it comes to Internet access by SMEs, \nas illustrated in Figure 7, percentages range from as high as 91% in Finland to a low of \n54% in Greece and Luxembourg. OECD (2000) shows notably lower levels at that time, \nwith Internet access for Greek SMEs being only 39%. Encouragingly, access to the \nInternet has increased considerably during the past two years for all surveyed countries, \nincluding Greece. Hence, the picture will further improve in the next few years.  \n12 \n \nFigure 7 European Internet access for SMEs \n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\n90%\n100%\nFi\nnd\nlan\nd\nSw\ned\nen\nDe\nnm\nar\nk\nAu\nstr\nia\nGe\nrm\nan\ny\nNo\nrw\nay\nIta\nly\nSp\nain UK\nNe\nth\ner\nlan\nds\nLu\nxu\nm\nbo\nur\ng\nGr\nee\nce\nSource: EC, 2001:7 \nThe most important barrier for Greek SMEs are the security aspect of Internet access, \nand in particular hacking and viruses, as illustrated in Figure 8 (EU, 2001). Secondly, \nspeed and reliability of communications are problematic. A third barrier is lack of interest \nin eCommerce opportunities, mainly due to the low demand from Greek consumers and \nscepticism about the potential benefits of eCommerce. Insufficient ICT and eCommerce \nskills as well as initial and continuing costs of the Internet are also featured as key \ninhibitors. Finally telecommunication costs, real or perceived, are also considered \nproblematic due to the lack of a flat rate for Internet (EU, 2002).  \n \nFigure 8 Main inhibitors to Greek Internet access \n0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25%\nLack of security\nData communication too slow\/unstable\nLack of skills\nLack of perceived benefits\nSet up cost too high\nAccess cost too high\nSource: EC, 2001:37 \n \nFigure 9 illustrates the Web presence of SMEs, through websites established, operated \nand maintained wholly or partially by SMEs themselves or by third party application \nproviders. However, the two sets of data are not mutually exclusive as SMEs may use \nthird party application service providers for some aspects of their web site and they may \nalso host their own sites. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the overall web \npresence by aggregating the responses to both questions. Yet, it is evident that there is \na low level of outsourcing for these functions. A much higher level of outsourcing might \nbe expected in future to enable busy entrepreneurs to access complete eCommerce \nsolutions and to compete internationally (EU, 2002).  \n13 \n \nFigure 9 SMEs Development of Internet Presence  \n28%\n8%\n0%\n5%\n10%\n15%\n20%\n25%\n30%\nSMEs Internet access\nvia own website\nSMEs Internet access\nvia third party website\nSource: EC, 2002:9 \n \nAccording to a benchmarking project by the European Commission, Greece currently has \nthe lowest levels of eCommerce, as demonstrated in Table 1 (EU, 2002). However, this \nresearch only included enterprises of between 10 and 249 employees and excluded \nmicro-enterprises of less than 10 employees. The real picture is less optimistic and \npolicies are required for boosting the Internet adoption in SMEs. \n \nTable 1  SME e-business adoption rates in 2001 \n% of SMEs Using \nICT \nHaving \nweb \naccess \nHaving a \npresence \non web via \nown web \nsite \nHaving a \npresence \non web via \nthird party \nweb site \nMaking \neCommer\nce \npurchases\nMaking \neCommerce \nsales \nAustria   92 83 53 26 14 11\nDenmark 95 86 62 N\/A 36 27\nSpain 91 66 6 28 9 6\nFinland 98 91 58 N\/A 34 13\nGreece 84 54 28 8 5 6\nSweden 96 90 67 N\/A 31 11\nUK 92 62 49 11 32 16\nGermany 96 82 65 21 35 29\nLuxembourg 90 54 39 13 18 9\nNetherlands 87 62 31 N\/A 23 22\nItaly 86 71 9 26 10 3\nNorway 93 73 47 N\/A 43 10\nSource: EC, 2002 \nGreek SMEs are at the lower levels of adoption of eCommerce for \npurchases\/procurement and sales (McMahon, 2002). Only 5% procure online and only \n6% make eCommerce sales. However, Greece is the only exception of all surveyed \ncountries in which SMEs use eCommerce more for sales, than for purchases. This might \nbe attributable to the fact that purchasing is based on networks of interpersonal \nrelationships, whilst SMEs primarily use the Internet to promote their products as a \nshopping window for the world. Figure 10 also illustrates that the majority of SMEs \ndeclare that they are using ICTs, mainly for accounting and operations management. \nHowever, just over 50% are currently on the Internet and less than 30% have their own \n14 \n \nweb site. eCommerce is weak in both sales and procurement and SMEs have yet to \nexplore the full potential of the Internet.  \n \nFigure 10 Usage of ICT and Internet adoption by Greek SMEs \n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90%\nUsing ICT\nHaving web access\nPresence via own web site\nPresence via third party web site\ne-commerce purchases\ne-commerce sales\nSource: EC, 2002 \nA fair percentage of SMEs have recently developed web sites as a mechanism to provide \ninformation about their products. Most of these developments were propelled by \nsalesmen who convinced entrepreneurs that their businesses should be on the Internet. \nOften a simple web site, with few HTML pages providing static and frequently out of \ndate information, were produced to \u2018test the water\u2019.  The vast majority of SMEs still lack \nthe skills and more importantly the appetite for an eCommerce strategy.   \n \n5.2 Internet and e-Commerce use by micro Enterprises \n \nMicro enterprises employ less than 10 employees and are usually family businesses. \nThese are often located in peripheral regions and are critical for regional development \nand for creating local employment. Whereas SMEs are somehow in convergence with the \nEU mean, the Greek micro enterprises have much lower levels of ICT take up, as \nillustrated in Table 2.  \nTable 2 ICT use by Greek micro enterprises \nNumber of employees PC use Internet Access \nSole proprietors 24% 10%\n2-5 32% 14%\n6-10 71% 35%\nSource: GSRT, 2002 \n \nGreek micro enterprises differ with SMEs on the degree of Internet presence. Almost \n40% of larger size SMEs already have a website, against 2.6% of micro enterprises. The \nreal estate sector of micro enterprises has the highest rate of PC usage (81%) and \nInternet presence (43%), whilst hotels and restaurant enterprises have the lowest \npercentages (8% and 4% respectively). The manufacturing and transportation \u2013 \ncommunications sectors also have a high ICT usage (GSRT, 2002). \n \nThe main inhibitors for the exploitation of new technologies are lack of knowledge, poor \nmanagement skills and qualifications for both entrepreneurs and employees. Ignorance \nand a lack of interest are also critical factors as a large percentage (45%) of enterprises \nsurveyed declared that they have no difficulty in ICT use, but they just do not want to \nemploy it. This is combined with the companies that did not answer at all (19%) and can \n15 \n \nreach a total of 64%. Hence the overwhelming majority of micro SMEs have failed to \nidentify additional benefits gained by using ICTs.  \n \n6 Information Society, eBusiness and eCommerce policies in Greece \n \nThe EC (2002) recognises that the fact that SMEs lag behind larger enterprises with \nrespect to the take up of ICT and e-business, this is a matter of political concern and \ncalls for remedial action. However, they appreciate that policy actions in support of e-\nbusiness and ICT adoption for SMEs should be based on sound knowledge of the \nproblems to be solved. As explained in section 2, the Greek economy, policies and \ngovernment have been going through a strategic transformation in the last decade. The \nInformation Society (1999) provided a comprehensive strategy for Greece and identifies \nthat ICTs rapidly change the way we work, play and communicate. They also transform \nthe basis of economic competition and formulate new conditions and opportunities for \ngrowth, prosperity and quality of life. The aim of the Greek government is to reduce \ninequalities on-line and to diminish the digital divide. Its overall strategy is based on \nsome basic principles: equal opportunities and access for all. These can be achieved \nthrough the creation of an environment that is conducive to entrepreneurship and \ninnovation whilst safeguarding personal freedoms and supporting the operation of \ndemocratic institutions. A number of goals were set to implement this strategy, namely:  \n \n\u2022 Offering better services to citizens and firms, through the modernisation of the state \noperation, and greater access and transparency. \n\u2022 Achieving a better quality of life, through the application of ICTs in health & welfare, \nthe environment and transport. \n\u2022 Creating an educational system adapted to the digital age, by developing the use of \nnew technologies in education and networking of schools and universities.  \n\u2022 Realising faster economic growth, through fostering the creation of new firms, new \nsectors, and increasing productivity and competitiveness. \n\u2022 Increasing employment, by supporting the creation of new jobs, upgrading skills, and \ndeveloping new forms of work. \n\u2022 Promoting Greek culture and civilisation, through the documentation of cultural \nheritage, protection of the Greek language, and contact with Greeks abroad. \n\u2022 Encouraging the use of new technologies in mass media, by creating an appropriate \nregulatory framework and safeguarding pluralism and free expression. \n\u2022 Achieving equal participation of all regions of Greece in the Information Society, \nthrough decentralisation and the encouragement of regional and local initiatives. \n\u2022 Developing a national communication infrastructure, through new investments, \nregulatory reforms in telecommunications and universal service requirements. \n\u2022 Protecting the rights of citizens and of consumers and upholding democratic \ninstitutions and participation in the digital age. \n \nThese policies and goals are constantly updated and reformulated to address the emerging \nchallenges and opportunities (Information Society, 2003). In addition, a number of National and \nEuropean specific programmes are currently implemented to support these policies and goals, to \nstimulate usage of the Internet and eCommerce by SMEs and to facilitate their transition \ntowards the eEconomy, as presented in Table 3. However, the main responsibility for the \ntransition towards the e-Economy remains with the enterprises themselves (McMahon, 2002). It \nis therefore encouraging that these programmes have already attracted an interest of more that \n13000 Greek SMEs organisations. \n \n16 \n \n7. Discussion and stakeholders analysis  \n \nThe analysis clearly demonstrates that both demand\/consumption and supply\/production in \nGreece are in their early stages of their ICT and eCommerce adoption circle. There is, \nhowever, evidence that demonstrates that the growth of the ICT and eCommerce usage is \ngreater than in mature European markets and hence the digital divide gap is being reduced. \nTo the degree that ICT adoption determines national competitiveness, the Greek economy \nneeds to move faster to explore the entire benefits of the ICT and eCommerce \nopportunities.  \n \nStakeholders are organisations, groups, or individuals that have a major interest on the \nprocess and also include both those who affect and those who are affected by the \ndevelopments (Wheeler, 1997). Some of the stakeholders have more influence, depending \non their resources and administrative power (Vincent, 1990). Stakeholder analysis illustrates \nthe different groups of people who can influence the development of eCommerce and ICTs \nin Greece. This allows a better understanding of the key participants in the process, their \ncontribution and potential influence. Four principle stakeholders have been identified in the \npaper, namely the Greek public\/consumers, suppliers\/investors, governmental \nagencies\/policy makers and international organisations. \n \nThe Greek public\/consumers effectively determine the level of demand for eCommerce \nservices. Hitherto, eCommerce in Greece is limited in comparison to northern European \ncountries due to a number of reasons, including:  \n\u2022 low level of ICT usage; \n\u2022 lack of credit cards;  \n\u2022 domination of English as the web and ICT languages;  \n\u2022 and purchasing culture based on personal relationships and networks.  \n \nCurrently therefore, within the innovation diffusion theory framework, innovators and early \nadopters (counting for less than 15% of the population) use the Internet and only \ninnovators for eCommerce. However, gradually Greek consumers are moving on. As more \nschool and University graduates come to the marketplace, with computer skills as part of \ntheir education, the country will experience much higher levels of ICT penetration and \neCommerce in the very near future. This is particularly the case for younger generations as \nwell as for young executives that work with international companies and use the Internet \nextensively. With expectations that by the end of 2003, 20% of the Greek population will \nhave Internet access a number of online services are emerging to propel eCommerce. This \nis evident by the gradual transformation of banking, where most of the banks are now fully \noperational online and aim to facilitate transactions and to reduce waiting times at their \nbranches (GBN, 2003).  \n \nThe further development of Greek portals and the establishment of online marketplaces, \nsuch as in.gr, will be critical for eCommerce in Greece, as they will point people to relevant \ncontent in their proximity. In addition, to the degree that special offers and good\/secure \nservice is available, online users will be willing to migrate distribution channels to online \nplayers. This is evident with airlines such as Easyjet, which sells the majority of its tickets \nonline even for the Athens routes. There are clear similarities to the patterns of eCommerce \nadoption in major markets few years ago.  \n \nAgainst this background, enterprises need to make some difficult decisions with regards to \ntheir ICT investments and their Internet adoption. Unless a significant proportion of their \ncustomers are willing and able to purchase their products online enterprises are \n17 \n \nunderstandably reluctant to invest heavily on eCommerce. It is therefore proposed that \nenterprises in Greece initially need to focus their ICT investments to support their Business \nto Business (B2B) transactions, where a number of benefits can be clearly identified through \nthe reengineering of their interactions with their suppliers and institutional customers. By \nenhancing their value chain they can make significant cost savings and expand their \ncatchment area. Depending on their sector, Business to Consumer (B2C) web presence can \nalso facilitate their interaction with consumers through information provision and gradually \nfully transactional eCommerce sites. A number of enterprises have emerged in the last few \nyears, selling ICT equipment, books, music, food and wine, flowers and travel products \nonline. They address primarily the younger and technologically advanced markets. In \nadditional, several enterprises provide Greek products internationally, often targeting Greek \nimmigrants living abroad. As organisations that register a dot.gr domain must be legal and \nVAT-registered entities, there is a certain degree of security with transactions made with \nthese entities.  \n \nHowever, as the consumer behaviour of the Greek public is primarily influences by personal \nrelationships and face to face to contacts, enterprises need to develop multi-channel \nstrategies where they support sales consistently across all their online and off-line channels. \nAchieving consistency between all channels, adding value for money and time, and \nsupporting personal relationships with prospective customers will be critical for their success. \n \nState\/government intervention is also important for the adoption of eCommerce in \nGreece and the public sector will have to undertake a number of tasks, including:  \n\u2022 Educate and train people on ICTs and eCommerce through schooling, \nprofessional training and adult education \n\u2022 Develop a regulatory framework for the emerging electronic marketplace  \n\u2022 Provide incentives for SMEs and micro-enterprises to adopt emerging ICTs and to \ntake advantage of eCommerce applications  \n\u2022 Reengineer the public sector services and enhance its communications with both \nconsumers and businesses \n\u2022 Provide the infrastructure to reduce the digital divide between different age \ngroups, social classes and regions  \n \nInternational organisations including the European Union and OECD also play a critical \nrole by introducing policies and measures that enable governments and public sector agencies \nto implement them at the local level. A wide range of funding opportunities are also available \nthrough international organisations which often provide incentives for other stakeholders to \ninvest on ICTs and eCommerce. The European Commission in particular has provided \nsignificant budgets for peripheral regions and Small and Medium Enterprises to implement \ninnovative technologies. \n \nICT adoption and education should be identified as a significant factor for the future \ncompetitiveness of the Greek economy. Investment on both areas should be of high priority \nand should bring dividends in the form of economic growth, regional development and \nimprovement in quality of life.  \n \n18 \n \nTable 3 National ICT programmes in specific focus areas \nPolicy Area E-business Awareness and Training Programme Title Network Yourself \nGreece is targeting 50,000 SMEs under the \u2018Network Yourself\u2019 programme which is part of their wider \n\u2018Go Digital\u2019 campaign.

Conclusions \n \nThis paper examined the generic level of ICT penetration and the level of eCommerce both for \nthe production\/supply and consumption\/demand sides. The results are critical for decision-\nmakers in both the private and public sectors as they determine both public policy and \ninvestment decisions. Greece presents some of the lowest levels of ICT and Internet adoption \nin the European Union for both consumers and enterprises. It is apparent that the use of \neCommerce is in embryonic stage. The adoption of new technologies in SMEs is generally \nlower than other European countries, mainly due to lack of awareness and IT skills. Moreover, \nlow eCommerce transactions confirm that Mediterranean consumers are in the habit of buying \nthrough interpersonal networks. \n \nFrom the production point of view, this situation threatens the future competitiveness and the \nability of Greek SMEs to develop and commercialise their products. Ultimately this can \njeopardise regional development and economic growth. From the consumption point of view, \nconsumers and citizens seems less able than other European nations to access information, \ninteract and purchase products on-line. However, there is real potential for growth propelled \nby the education system, which encourages both school and university students to use the \nInternet. The evidence demonstrates that younger people in Greece are almost as prolific \ncomputer users as in northern Europe.  \n \nThe European Commission and the Greek government are developing initiatives and policies \nwhich aim to encourage the widespread adoption and adaptation of ICTs. Initiatives, such as \nthe Go-Digital, have already made an impact. There are some concrete results in terms of \nInternet and eCommerce use, while prospects for future adoption and use seem to be \noptimistic. Statistics in this fast moving and fluid area are notoriously unreliable. Nevertheless \nthe picture emerging is one of an electronic market that is developing fairly quickly. This is a \nprimarily a result of three key factors, namely: the new generations emerging through the \neducation system with ICT skills embedded in their knowledge base; the expansion of \ninternational investment in Greece and the subsequent transfer of know-how and \ntechnologies; and finally public sector and European Union policies and incentives that allow \nsmaller organisations to invest in ICTs and eCommerce. However, return on ICT investment is \nstill limited in comparison with other more advance regions and hence entrepreneurs are \ncautious in their approaches.
