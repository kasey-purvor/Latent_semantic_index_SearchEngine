INTRODUCTION\nIt has long been realized that the small-angle scattering of\nX-rays by dust grains can result in a detectable X-ray \u201chalo\u201d\naround a distant X-ray source (Overbeck 1965), with a radial\nintensity distribution that depends on the dust properties and\nlocation. This phenomenon was first detected by Rolf (1983)\nusing data from Einstein and confirmed by later observations\n(e.g., Mauche & Gorenstein 1986; Predehl et al. 1991).\nIn the case of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), the transient nature\nof the burst combined with the large initial X-ray flux means\nthat X-ray scattering may be visible for a short period of time\nwith a relatively high surface brightness. As the transient flux\npasses through a dust slab between the observer and the GRB,\nthe scattering process introduces a time delay in which the X-\nrays at larger angles to the line of sight arrive increasingly\ndelayed with respect to the nonscattered X-rays. Thus, the dust\nallows us to view the GRB X-ray flux at earlier times. The\ntime-dependent X-ray halo around the GRB can, in principle,\nbe used to provide detailed information on the location, spatial\ndistribution, and properties of the dust and the distance to and\nbrightness of the GRB (e.g., Tru\u00a8mper & Scho\u00a8felder 1973; Klose\n1994; Miralda-Escude\u00b4 1999; Draine 2003). Images of transient\nX-ray sources seen in scattered light are analogous to \u201clight\nechos\u201d seen around some supernovae (e.g., SN 1987A; Xu,\nCrotts, & Kunkel 1995).\nScattered X-rays observed at an angle v from the line of\n1 Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester, University\nRoad, Leicester LE1 7RH, UK; sav2@star.le.ac.uk, rw@star.le.ac.uk, pto@star\n.le.ac.uk, julo@star.le.ac.uk, anl@star.le.ac.uk, mgw@star.le.ac.uk, jat@star.le\n.ac.uk.\n2 Laboratory for High Energy Astrophysics, Code 662, NASA Goddard\nSpace Flight Center, Greenbelt Road, Greenbelt, MD 20771; jnr@milkyway\n.gsfc.nasa.gov.\n3 Universities Space Research Association.\n4 Niels Bohr Institute for Astronomy, Physics and Geophysics, University\nof Copenhagen, Julian-Maries Vej 30, DK-2100 Copenhagen \u00d8, Denmark;\ndarach@astro.ku.dk.\n5 XMM-Newton SOC, Villafranca, Apartado 50727, E-28080 Madrid, Spain;\nmsantos@xmm.vilspa.esa.es, prodrigu@xmm.vilspa.esa.es, norbert.schartel@esa\n.int.\nsight to a GRB arrive after the direct emission with a time\ndelay given byts\n2(1\u0001 z )D D vs s g\nt p , (1)s 2cDg, s\nwhere and are the redshift and angular diameter distancez Ds s\nof the scattering dust, is the angular diameter distance ofDg\nthe GRB, and is the angular diameter distance from theDg, s\ndust to the GRB (Miralda-Escude\u00b4 1999).\nHere we discuss the case of GRB 031203 observed by XMM-\nNewton on two occasions shortly after the burst. The first ob-\nservation revealed the first dust-scattered X-ray halo detected\naround a GRB.\n2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA ANALYSIS\nGRB 031203 was detected by the Imager on Board the\nINTEGRAL Satellite on 2003 December 3 at 22:01:28 UT as\na single peaked burst with a duration of 30 s and peak flux of\nergs s\u00021 cm\u00022 in the 20\u2013200 keV band (Gotz et al.\u000271.3# 10\n2003; Mereghetti & Gotz 2003). A 58 ks XMM-Newton ob-\nservation of the field began at 2003 December 4, 04:09:29 UT.\nSeveral X-ray sources were detected within the 2\u0001.5 radius\nINTEGRAL error circle (Santos-Lleo\u00b4 & Caldero\u00b4n 2003), the\nbrightest of which (S1) appeared to fade through the obser-\nvation (Rodr\u0131\u00b4guez-Pascual et al. 2003) and was interpreted as\nthe X-ray afterglow of GRB 031203. We refined the astrometric\nposition of the afterglow by performing a cross-correlation with\nthe USNO-A2.0 catalog; the improved S1 position was\nR.A.p 08h02m30s.19, decl. 51\u000104\u0002.0 (J2000.0; 1 j errorp \u000239\u0002\n0\u0002.7; Tedds et al. 2003).\nThe position in the Galactic plane ( )lp 255\u0002, bp \u00024.6\u0002\nresults in high optical extinction [ ; Schlegel,E(B\u0002V )p 1.0\nFinkbeiner, & Davis 1998]. Optical\/IR observations failed to\nlocate an afterglow. Radio observations did locate a transient\nsource location consistent with the X-ray afterglow (Soderberg,\nKulkarni, & Frail 2003), and optical imaging and spectroscopy\nrevealed a candidate host galaxy at that shows star-zp 0.105\nforming features typical of GRB hosts (Prochaska et al. 2003a,\n2003b). Our refined location for the X-ray afterglow is within\n0\u0002.5 of the optical galaxy and consistent with the position of\nthe radio source.\nL6 VAUGHAN ET AL. Vol. 603\nFig. 1.\u2014Combined MOS images of GRB 031203 covering the 0.7\u20132.5 keV range, spanning 10\u0001 on a side. The data were divided into 10 contiguous time\nintervals lasting 5780 s. The images obtained from the first six time slices are shown (smoothed using a 6\u0002 Gaussian kernel). The three brightest point sources\n(S1, S2, and S3) are marked. [See the electronic edition of the Journal for a color version of this figure.]\nFig. 2.\u2014Radial profile of counts about the GRB 031203 afterglow from 10\ncontiguous time intervals (derived from the combined MOS 0.7\u20132.5 keV im-\nages). The afterglow itself (S1) and the next two brightest point sources (S2\nand S3) were removed prior to calculating the profiles. The two peaks cor-\nresponding to the two expanding rings are obvious. The dotted lines denote\nthe best-fitting functions (see Fig. 3).1\/2v \u221d (t\u0002 t )0\nDuring the first XMM-Newton observation the GRB was\nobserved on axis with all European Photon Imaging Camera\n(EPIC) instruments in full-frame modes (Stru\u00a8der et al. 2001;\nTurner et al. 2001). A second 54 ks XMM-Newton observation\nwas obtained on 2003 December 6 in which the GRB was \u22486\u0001\noff axis. The observational details and the GRB spectrum and\nlight curve are discussed in detail in Watson et al. (2004).\nThe extraction of science products followed standard pro-\ncedures using the XMM-Newton Science Analysis System (SAS\nver. 5.4.1 ). The EPIC data were processed using the SAS chains\nto produce calibrated event lists and remove background flares.\nGRB afterglow source counts were extracted from circular\nregions (radius 34\u0002), and background counts were estimated\nfrom a large off-axis region free from obvious point sources\nand the halo. The GRB afterglow fades as , where\u00020.4(t\u0002 t )0\nis the time of the GRB, which is unusually slow for GRBt0\nX-ray afterglows.\n3. THE X-RAY HALO\nThe X-ray image from the first XMM-Newton observation\nreveals an extended circular halo concentric with the GRB\n031203 afterglow (see Fig. 1). This halo was seen in all three\ncameras of the EPIC instrument, is unique to this observation,\nand is not due to scattered optical or X-ray light within the\ninstrument. Summing the entire observation, the halo had the\nform of a virtually complete ring (Vaughan et al. 2003), but\nsplitting the observation into contiguous time intervals revealed\ndistinct rings that increased in radius through the observation.\nIn order to better quantify this expansion, EPIC MOS images\nwere produced for 10 contiguous time intervals of 5780 s du-\nration, spanning the entire first observation and binned to\n4\u0002 pixels. We concentrate on the MOS data as the halo lies over\nseveral chip gaps in the EPIC pn images, but the same halo was\nseen in both. The radial profiles of the images about the afterglow\nwere calculated removing the three brightest point sources within\nthe region of interest (S1, S2, and S3 in Fig. 1) by ignoring all\ncounts within 40\u0002 from the centroid of each source. The radial\nprofiles were then background subtracted using the mean level\nfrom the 350\u0002\u2013400\u0002 annulus, which is well outside the detected\nhalo. The resulting count profiles as a function of radius are\nshown in Figure 2. The strongest peak moved outward from\n\u223c120\u0002 to \u223c220\u0002 during the observation, while a second peak\nmoved from \u223c160\u0002 to \u223c270\u0002.\nThe radial positions of the two rings were measured from\nNo. 1, 2004 X-RAY HALO AROUND GRB 031203 L7\nFig. 3.\u2014Expansion of the two rings around GRB 031203 with time. The\nradius of each ring was measured from the local maxima of the radial profiles\n(Fig. 2). In both cases the expansion was well fitted with a functional form\n. The errors were assumed to be the width of the bin size used1\/2v \u221d (t\u0002 t )0\nfor the radial profile measurement.\nFig. 4.\u2014Absorbed power-law model fits to the EPIC pn spectra of the GRB\n031203 afterglow (circles, thick line) integrated over the entire observation\nand the dust halo (squares, thin line) integrated over the first half (27895 s)\nof the observation (during which the surface brightness was high enough for\na reasonable spectral extraction). This clearly demonstrates that the spectrum\nof the halo is significantly steeper than the afterglow.

At these distances, the\nring diameters probe size scales of 2\u20133 pc in the dust-scattering\nmedium.\nThe halo spectrum was extracted from an annulus with radii\n110\u0002\u2013220\u0002 using only the first half of the observation; the de-\ncreased surface brightness of the halo at later times makes spec-\ntral extraction unreliable. A background spectrum was extracted\nfrom a large off-axis region (avoiding the halo and other point\nsources). Figure 4 shows the halo spectrum compared to the\nafterglow spectrum. The spectrum of the halo is much steeper\nthan that of the afterglow. Fitting with a simple absorbed power\nlaw yielded photon indices of andGp 1.98\u0003 0.05 3.03\u0003\nfor the afterglow and halo, respectively. The best-fitting0.14\nabsorbing column was cm\u00022 when fixed21N p 8.8\u0003 0.5# 10H\nto be the same for both afterglow and halo spectra. This is larger\nthan the Galactic value of cm\u00022 (Dickey &21N p 6.1# 10H\nLockman 1990).

This is a valid\napproximation if the grain radius in units of mm is much less\nthan the X-ray photon energy in units of keV (Smith & Dwek\n1998). We assume that the dust is confined to two slabs at dis-\ntances and with thickness . The halo seen is createdD D DD1 2\nby the combination of the soft X-ray pulse from the GRB and\nthe subsequent afterglow. The observed angular width of the\nrings results from a combination of the duration of the soft X-\nray pulse, , , and the point-spread function (PSF) of theDt DD\ntelescope. The width of the PSF corresponds to s orDt \u223c 1000\npc. Given that the GRB is very short, \u223c30 s (Mer-DD \u223c 100\neghetti & Gotz 2003), we assume that s, and hence,Dt K 1000\nallowing for the PSF, the observed broadening of the rings, 20\u0002,\ngives us an estimate of the slab thickness, pc.DDp 130\u0003 50\nThe angular and temporal distribution was well fitted using\ngrains with radii in the range mm.

Using this range of grain sizes, we require the\ninitial GRB pulse and afterglow to have a photon index of\n(as observed for the afterglow from 6 hr) to match theG \u223c 2.0\nobserved photon index of the halo ( ).Gp 3.0\nThe brightness of the halo depends on the product of the\ndifferential scattering cross sections of the grains, the column\ndensities of the grains in the slabs, and the integrated flux of\nthe X-ray pulse and afterglow. Interstellar extinction maps show\nstructure in the GRB direction, with a considerable increase to\nmag at a distance of \u223c1.3 kpc (Neckel & Klare 1980).A \u2248 2V\nThis distance is consistent with the location of the more distant\ndust slab that we detect. Adopting a mean grain size of ap\nmm, an mag corresponds to a grain column density0.2 A p 2V\nof cm\u00022 (Mauche & Gorenstein 1986).

Given the assumptions (e.g.,2.4\u0003 1.2\nspectral shape), this is in reasonable agreement with the value\nreported for GRB 031203 (peak of \u223c1.2 photons cm\u00022 s\u00021;\nGotz et al. 2003; Mereghetti & Gotz 2003). The X-ray burst\nis very bright compared to the afterglow (see Watson et al.\n2004). Extrapolating the decay of the afterglow (\u00a7 2) to the\ntime of the GRB accounts for only \u223c2% of the halo emission.\nThe line of sight to GRB 031203 passes close to the center\nof the Gum Nebula that appears as a 28\u0002 diameter sphere in Ha\ncentered at (Chanot & Sivan 1983). Thelp 258\u0002, bp \u00022\u0002\nGum Nebula is likely to be a supershell created by repeated\nsupernovae explosions within it.
