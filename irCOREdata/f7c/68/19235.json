Introduction\nCondensed matter physics is a subject continually in-\nspired by the fabrication of new materials. With each\nnew generation of materials synthesized comes a new\nset of challenges for the condensed matter physics com-\nmunity to understand and exploit. To the observer this\nmay seem surprising since the basic interactions gov-\nerning the motion of the electrons and atomic nuclei in\na solid have long been known. While this is true, with\neach new compound we see these basic forces at work\nin a di\u000berent local environment and the result is rarely\na trivial extrapolation of the physics we knew before.\nInstead, with each level of complexity we see new types\nof phenomena arising - every bit as fundamental as the\nbare interactions with which we began (see Anderson\n1972). Examples of such radically new behaviour in-\nclude the appearance of fractionally charged objects in\nthe fractional quantum Hall e\u000bect, the observation of\nsuper-massive electrons in so-called heavy fermion ma-\nterials and the possibility of the electron decaying into\nnew types of particle in certain one-dimensional mate-\nrials. One of the current areas of excitement in the \feld\nhas been motivated by the discovery of certain metallic\ncompounds which seem to fall outside of the framework\nof our current theory of metals.\nIt is hard to imagine describing the physics of metals\nwithout beginning with the electron yet, remarkably,\nover the past decade there is a growing \feld of con-\ndensed matter physics devoted to understanding metals\nwhere the electron seems to be precisely the wrong place\nto start. Of course we are well aware that the basic in-\ngredients of solids are atoms with their valence and core\nelectrons and nuclei but, as often happens in condensed\nmatter, in bringing such atoms together what emerges\ncan be very di\u000berent from the constituent parts, with\nthe possibility of completely new types of \u2018particles\u2019.\n(Two more familiar examples of new particles appearing\nin condensed matter systems are phonons{quantized\nlattice vibrations{and magnons{waves of spin in a mag-\nnet.) Yet for the understanding of the metallic state the\nelectron has remained the unrivaled basis since Drude\u2019s\ninitial work at the beginning of this century (Drude\n1900). The success of the single electron picture of met-\nals rests on Landau\u2019s seminal work in the 1950\u2019s devel-\noping Fermi-liquid theory (Landau 1956, 1957, 1958).\nYet as this century closes we are seeing the discovery of\nmaterials, including the cuprate superconductors and\nother oxides, which seem to lie outside this framework.\nIn this review I will attempt to give a flavour of our\nattempts to understand such \u2018non-Fermi liquid\u2019 metals.\nMany of the theoretical ideas have been developed using\nrather complex mathematical machinery which I make\nno apology for omitting in favour of a more descriptive\napproach. There are however a number of results which\n1\nNon-Fermi liquids A. J. Scho\feld 2\ncan be obtained relatively simply using Fermi\u2019s golden\nrule (together with Maxwell\u2019s equations) and I have in-\ncluded these for readers who would like to see where\nsome of the properties are coming from.\nThe outline of this review is as follows. I begin with\na description of Fermi-liquid theory itself. This the-\nory tells us why one gets a very good description of a\nmetal by treating it as a gas of Fermi particles (i.e. that\nobey Pauli\u2019s exclusion principle) where the interactions\nare weak and relatively unimportant. The reason is\nthat the particles one is really describing are not the\noriginal electrons but electron-like quasiparticles that\nemerge from the interacting gas of electrons. Despite its\nrecent failures which motivate the subject of non-Fermi\nliquids, it is a remarkably successful theory at describ-\ning many metals including some, like UPt3, where the\ninteractions between the original electrons are very im-\nportant. However, it is seen to fail in other materials\nand these are not just exceptions to a general rule but\nare some of the most interesting materials known. As\nan example I discuss its failure in the metallic state of\nthe high temperature superconductors.\nI then present four examples which, from a theo-\nretical perspective, generate non-Fermi liquid metals.\nThese all show physical properties which can not be\nunderstood in terms of weakly interacting electron-like\nobjects:\n\u000f Metals close to a quantum critical point. When a\nphase transition happens at temperatures close to\nabsolute zero, the quasiparticles scatter so strongly\nthat they cease to behave in the way that Fermi-\nliquid theory would predict.\n\u000f Metals in one dimension{the Luttinger liquid. In\none dimensional metals, electrons are unstable and\ndecay into two separate particles (spinons and\nholons) that carry the electron\u2019s spin and charge\nrespectively.\n\u000f Two-channel Kondo models. When two indepen-\ndent electrons can scatter from a magnetic impu-\nrity it leaves behind \\half an electron\".\n\u000f Disordered Kondo models. Here the scattering\nfrom disordered magnetic impurities is too strong\nto allow the Fermi quasiparticles to form.\nWhile some of these ideas have been used to try and un-\nderstand the high temperature superconductors, I will\nshow that in many cases one can see the physics illus-\ntrated by these examples in other materials. I believe\nthat we are just seeing the tip of an iceberg of new types\nof metal which will require a rather di\u000berent starting\npoint from the simple electron picture to understand\ntheir physical properties.\nFigure 1: The ground state of the free Fermi gas in mo-\nmentum space. All the states below the Fermi surface\nare \flled with both a spin-up and a spin-down elec-\ntron. A particle-hole excitation is made by promoting\nan electron from a state below the Fermi surface to an\nempty one above it.\n2. Fermi-Liquid Theory: the electron quasi-\nparticle\nThe need for a Fermi-liquid theory dates from the\n\frst applications of quantum mechanics to the metallic\nstate. There were two key problems. Classically each\nelectron should contribute 3kB=2 to the speci\fc heat\ncapacity of a metal|far more than is actually seen ex-\nperimentally. In addition, as soon as it was realized\nthat the electron had a magnetic moment, there was\nthe puzzle of the magnetic susceptibility which did not\nshow the expected Curie temperature dependence for\nfree moments: \u001f \u0018 1=T .\nThese puzzles were unraveled at a stroke when\nPauli (Pauli 1927, Sommerfeld 1928) (apparently\nreluctantly|see Hermann et al. 1979) adopted Fermi\nstatistics for the electron and in particular enforced the\nexclusion principle which now carries his name: No two\nelectrons can occupy the same quantum state. In the\nabsence of interactions one \fnds the lowest energy state\nof a gas of free electrons by minimizing the kinetic en-\nergy subject to Pauli\u2019s constraint. The resulting ground\nstate consists of a \flled Fermi sea of occupied states\nin momentum space with a sharp demarcation at the\nFermi energy \u000fF and momentum pF = \u0016hkF (the Fermi\nsurface) between these states and the higher energy un-\noccupied states above. The low energy excited states\nare obtained simply by promoting electrons from just\nbelow the Fermi surface to just above it (see Fig. 1).\nThey are uniquely labelled by the momentum and spin\nquantum numbers of the now empty state below the\nFermi energy (a hole) and the newly \flled state above\nit. These are known as particle-hole excitations.\nThis resolves these early puzzles since only a small\nfraction of the total number of electrons can take part\nNon-Fermi liquids A. J. Scho\feld 3\nin the processes contributing to the speci\fc heat and\nmagnetic susceptibility. The majority lie so far below\nthe Fermi surface that they are energetically unable to\n\fnd the unoccupied quantum state required to mag-\nnetize them or carry excess heat. Only the electrons\nwithin kBT of the Fermi surface can contribute kB to\nthe speci\fc heat so the speci\fc heat grows linearly with\ntemperature and is small. Only electrons within \u0016BB of\nthe Fermi surface can magnetize with a moment \u0018 \u0016B\nleading to a temperature independent (Pauli) suscepti-\nbility. Both quantities are proportional to the density\nof electron states at the Fermi surface.\nThese new temperature dependencies exactly\nmatched the experiments both on metals and then\nlater on the fermionic isotope of Helium - 3He (see, for\nexample, Wheatley 1970). But this in turn raised ques-\ntions. Why should a theory based on a non-interacting\npicture work so well in these systems where interactions\nare undoubtably important? Once interactions are\npresent the problem of \fnding the low energy states\nof the electrons becomes much harder. In addition to\nthe kinetic term which favours a low momentum, the\nenergy now contains a potential term which depends on\nthe relative position of all of the electrons. The energy\nscales of the kinetic energy and Coulomb interaction\nare comparable at metallic electron densities and,\nif that were not enough, Heisenberg\u2019s uncertainty\nprinciple prevents the simultaneously de\fnition of the\nmomentum and the position. How can one proceed and\nstill hope to retain the physics of the non-interacting\nelectron gas which experiment demands?\nThe answer provided by Landau rests on the concept\nof \\adiabatic continuity\" (Anderson 1981): labels as-\nsociated with eigenstates are more robust against per-\nturbations than the eigenstates themselves. Consider\nas an example the problem of a particle in a box with\nimpenetrable walls illustrated in Fig. 2. In elementary\nquantum mechanics one learns that the eigenstates of\nthis problem consist of standing sine waves with nodes\nat the well walls. The eigenstates of the system can be\nlabelled by the number of additional nodes in the wave-\nfunction with the energy increasing with the number of\nnodes. Now switch on an additional weak quadratic\npotential. The new eigenstates of the problem are no\nlonger simple sine waves but involve a mixing of all the\neigenstates of the original unperturbed problem. How-\never the number of nodes still remains a good way of\nlabelling the eigenstates of the more complicated prob-\nlem. This is the essence of adiabatic continuity.\nLandau applied this idea to the interacting gas of\nelectrons. He imagined turning on the interactions be-\ntween electrons slowly, and observing how the eigen-\nstates of the system evolved. He postulated that there\nwould be a one-to-one mapping of the low energy eigen-\nN=4\nN=3\nN=2\nN=1\nN=0\nN=4\nN=3\nN=2\nN=1\nN=0\n0 1\nl\nEnergy\n\u0000\n1\n2\nd\n2\n \ndx\n2\n+ V (x) = E V (x) =\n(\n1\n2\n\u0015x\n2\njxj < \u0019;\n1 jxj \u0015 \u0019:\nFigure 2: Adiabatic continuity is illustrated in a non-\ninteracting problem by turning on a quadratic potential\nto a particle con\fned in box.

He supposed that the good\nquantum numbers associated with the excitations of the\nnon-interacting system would remain good even after\nthe interactions were fully applied. Just as Pauli\u2019s ex-\nclusion principle determined the allowed labels with-\nout the interactions through the presence of a Fermi\nsurface, this feature would remain even with the in-\nteractions. We therefore retain the picture of Fermi\nparticles and holes excitations carrying the same quan-\ntum numbers as their electron counter-parts in the free\nFermi gas. These labels are not to be associated with\nelectrons but to \u2018quasiparticles\u2019 to remind us that the\nwavefunctions and energies are di\u000berent from the cor-\nresponding electron in the non-interacting problem. It\nis the concept of the fermion quasiparticle that lies at\nthe heart of Fermi-liquid theory. It accounts of the mea-\nsured temperature dependences of the speci\fc heat and\nPauli susceptibility since these properties only require\nthe presence of a well de\fned Fermi surface, and are\nnot sensitive to whether it is electrons or quasiparticles\nthat form it.\nRetaining the labels of the non-interacting state\nmeans that the con\fgurational entropy is unchanged\nin the interacting metal. [This also means that quasi-\nparticle distribution function is unchanged from the\nfree particle result (see Fig. 3a).] Each quasiparticle\nNon-Fermi liquids A. J.

In an interact-\ning system we must take into account that, unlike the\nfree Fermi gas, the energy of individual excitations will\nnot generally add to yield the total system energy. In\nLandau\u2019s theory, he accounted for the modi\fed energy\nthrough two terms. First, when a quasiparticle moves\nthere will now be a back-flow in the \flled Fermi sea as\nthe quasiparticle \u2018pushes\u2019 the ground state out of the\nway. This modi\fes the inertial mass of the quasiparticle\nm! m\u0003. (Note that this is in addition to the e\u000bect of\nthe crystal lattice|which produces a band mass which\ncan be included in the free electron picture|and also\nthe change induced by interactions with phonons.) Sec-\nond, a quasiparticle\u2019s energy also depends on the dis-\ntribution of other quasiparticles which Landau included\nvia his \u2018f function\u2019. The total energy of the interacting\nsystem is now expanded as a functional of the quasi-\nparticle distribution \u000en~k\u001b:\nE =\nX\n~k;\u001b\npF\nm\u0003\n(\u0016hk\u2212pF )\u000en~k\u001b+\n1\n2\nX\n~k~k\u2032;\u001b\u001b\u2032\nf~k\u001b;~k\u2032\u001b\u2032\u000en~k\u001b\u000en~k\u2032\u001b\u2032 ;\n(1)\nfor an isotropic system.

In writing Eq. 1 we have ne-\nglected the possibility that measuring the energy with\nthe Hamiltonian could change the quasiparticle distri-\nbution (\u000en~k;\u001b) itself. (That is to say that there remain\nmatrix elements in the Hamiltonian which, when acting\non a quasiparticle state, \u2018scatter\u2019 it into another state.)\nRecall that acting the Hamiltonian on a true eigenstate\nleaves the wave function unchanged up to a multiplica-\ntive constant (the eigenvalue). We can estimate the\nlifetime of these approximate eigenstates by consider-\ning the decay rate of a quasiparticle with energy \u000f above\nthe Fermi surface at absolute zero.

We\nwill assume, for the time being, that the scattering ma-\ntrix elements jVif j are constant and we will just enforce\nenergy conservation and, crucially, the Pauli principle\nfor quasiparticles. At absolute zero the only scattering\nallowed by the Pauli principle lowers the energy of the\noriginal quasiparticle by an amount ! by making an\nelectron-hole pair in the \flled Fermi sea. This process\nis illustrated in Fig. 4. The condition that the quasi-\nparticle must scatter into an unoccupied state requires\n! < \u000f. In addition only occupied states within ! of\nthe Fermi surface can absorb this energy by making a\nparticle state above the Fermi surface.

J. Scho\feld 5\nBox 1. The Kondo Model\nThe Kondo model gives us a paradigm for under-\nstanding how a Fermi liquid arises in a number of the\nheavy-fermion metals. At its simplest, it describes the\nbehaviour of a single spin-one-half (S = 1=2) magnetic\nion in an otherwise non-interacting sea of electrons.\nThe model is essentially zero dimensional since all the\naction occurs around the location of the ion. Typically\nthis magnetic ion prefers to align its magnetic moment\nanti-parallel to that of any nearby electron (i.e. anti-\nferromagnetically). Passing electrons scatter from the\nimpurity and both can exchange their spin directions\nin the process. Kondo (Kondo 1964) showed that, in\ncontrast to most forms of scattering in a metal which\nnormally reduce as the temperature is lowered, this\nspin-flip scattering grows logarithmically with decreas-\ning temperature. Higher order perturbation treatments\n(Abrikosov 1965) predicted that the scattering would\ndiverge at a \fnite \u2018Kondo\u2019 temperature (TK) |an im-\npossibility since the most scattering a single impurity\ncan do is the unitarity limit when it behaves as an im-\npenetrable sphere.\nUnderstanding what really happens for T <\u0018 TK re-\nquired ideas of scaling (Anderson and Yuval 1971) and\nthe renormalization group (Wilson 1975). It revealed\nthat the proper way to think of Kondo\u2019s logarithm was\nto view the strength of the antiferromagnetic interac-\ntion between the ion and the electrons as e\u000bectively\ngrowing with decreasing temperature. At \frst this just\nenhances the scattering but, as the temperature is low-\nered further, the coupling becomes so strong the that\nmagnetic ion prefers to bind tightly to a single elec-\ntron and form an inert singlet state. The susceptibility\nassociated with the impurity shows free-spin Curie be-\nhaviour at high temperatures but, as the singlet forms,\nthe susceptibility saturates. The impurity speci\fc heat\npeaks near TK but then falls linearly to zero as the en-\ntropy associated with the impurity spin [kB ln(2S + 1)]\nbecomes quenched in forming the S = 0 singlet. The\nscattering at T = 0 saturates at the unitarity limit\nand falls as T 2 for very small temperatures. The strik-\ning emergence of the Fermi liquid forms for these low\ntemperature properties is due to the low energy ex-\ncited states having a one-to-one correspondence with\na weakly interacting Fermi gas (Nozi\u0012eres 1974). The\nKondo temperature sets the e\u000bective Fermi energy of\nthis local Fermi liquid.\nFigure B1: At high temperatures the Kondo impurity\nscatters conduction electrons but as the temperature\nis lowered the e\u000bective interaction between impurity\nand conduction electrons grows. Eventually a singlet\nbound-state is formed which acts as an inert potential\nscatterer.\nThe physics of the Kondo model exactly parallels\nasymptotic freedom and quark con\fnement in QCD.\nAt high energies we see free spins (analogous to asymp-\ntotically free quarks with colour) but, as the energy is\nlowered, the spins become bound into singlets (analo-\ngous to the baryon colour singlets more familiar to us\nat terrestrial energies). The observation of Kondo type\nbehaviour in UPt3 and other heavy-fermion systems has\nbeen coined \u2018asymptotic freedom in a cryostat\u2019 (Cole-\nman 1993).\nTK TK TK\nT\nconst\nlog T\n-4\n1-aT2\nT\n-1\nlog T\n-1\nC\n\/k\nB\nc\nr\/r(0\n)\n(a) (b) (c)\nFigure B2: Impurity contributions to the (a) speci\fc heat, (b) susceptibility and (c) resistivity in the Kondo model\nas a function of temperature.

Adiabatic continuity tells us that\nin the quasiparticle wavefunction, there must remain\na fraction of the original non-interacting excited state\nwavefunction\nj qp(~k\u001b)i =\np\nzj\u001eel(~k\u001b)i+particle\u2212 hole excitations etc :\n(7)\nThat fraction, z, is known as the quasiparticle weight\nand, in a sense, plays the role of the order parameter of\nthe zero temperature Fermi liquid state. A simple con-\nsequence of the step in the quasiparticle distribution at\nT = 0 is that, if one could analyze the electron distribu-\ntion function, it too would show a discontinuous jump of\nsize z at the Fermi momentum (see Fig. 3). A theoreti-\ncal tool for following the fate of the original electrons in\nthe interacting Fermi liquid is called the spectral func-\ntion A(!;~k) (see, for example, Mahan 1990). It mea-\nsures the probability that an electron with momentum\n~k can be found with energy !. In the non-interacting\nsystem single electrons are eigenstates of the system so\nthe spectral function is a delta function \u000e(! \u2212 \u000f~k). In\nthe interacting system a given electron may take part\nin many eigenstates of the system and so the spectral\nfunction is spread out in energy. Nevertheless for mo-\nmenta near kF there is probability z that the electron\nmay be found in the quasiparticle eigenstate with mo-\nmentum ~k. So at T = 0 the electron spectral function\nin a Fermi liquid has a sharp peak at the new quasi-\nparticle energy with width proportional to (k \u2212 kF )2,\nreflecting the \fnite lifetime, and an integrated weight\nunder the peak of z (see Fig. 5).\nLet us pause now to summarize the main features of\nFermi-liquid theory. The success of the non-interacting\npicture of electrons is understood in terms of the exis-\ntence of Fermi quasiparticles as approximate low energy\neigenstates of the interacting system. We \fnd that:\n\u000f Equilibrium properties have the free electron form\nbut with modi\fed parameters.\n\u000f The low energy eigenstates are fermion quasiparti-\ncles with a scattering rate 1=\u001c \u0018 max(\u000f2; T 2).\n\u000f z is the \u2018order parameter\u2019 of the Fermi liquid:\nthe overlap of an electron and quasiparticle at the\nFermi surface.\n\u000f New collective modes can also appear.\nHow well does this theory perform when tested against\nexperiment?\nThus far it looks as though a new free parameter\nhas been introduced for each experiment. To test the\ntheory we should demonstrate that experiments over-\ndetermine these free parameters. This is most straight-\nforwardly done in 3He which is isotropic. There it turns\nout that four experimental quantities (speci\fc heat,\ncompressibility, susceptibility and zero sound velocity)\nspecify three of the Landau parameters and there is\ngood internal agreement (see Wheatley 1970). In the\nmetallic state the presence of a crystal lattice makes this\ntest harder since the reduced symmetry allows many\nmore Landau parameters. However, remarkably, recent\nexperiments have con\frmed the picture in one of the\nmost strongly interacting metals known: UPt3. The\nkey feature of this material is the presence of Uranium\nf electrons which are tightly bound to the atomic nu-\ncleus and are surrounded by a sea of conduction elec-\ntrons. At high temperatures the f electrons behave\nas free magnetic moments with the classical Curie sus-\nceptibility (Frings et al. 1983). As the temperature is\nlowered the free spins start to become bound to con-\nduction electrons to make up extremely heavy Landau\nquasiparticles (see Fig. 6). [The Kondo model (see\nBox. 1) provides our theoretical picture for how this\nNon-Fermi liquids A. J.

The coe\u000ecient of the T -linear term in the spe-\nci\fc heat (the intercept of the graph in Fig. 7 after\nStewart et al. 1984), though, is 450 mJ\/mol K2|two\norders of magnitude larger than that of a free electron\ngas. The e\u000bective mass of the quasiparticles has been\nvastly enhanced. This is adiabatic continuity pushed\nto the limits. To \u2018close\u2019 the theory one would like an\nindependent check on the quasiparticle mass. This can\nbe done from high magnetic \feld and low temperature\nmeasurements of the \\de Haas van Alphen e\u000bect\". At\nsu\u000eciently high magnetic \felds, quasiparticles can be\ndriven around their Fermi surface by the Lorentz force.\nThe quantization of these orbits leads to oscillations of\nthe magnetization as a function of applied \feld: a kind\nof spectroscopy of the Fermi surface. Using this (Taille-\nfer and Lonzarich 1988, Julian and McMullan 1998) one\ncan map out the shape of the quasiparticle Fermi sur-\nface and, from the temperature dependence, deduce the\nquasiparticle e\u000bective mass. These masses and Fermi\nsurfaces are shown in Fig. 7. Two key observations\nemerge even in this most interacting of environments:\n1. The volume of the Fermi surface includes the f\nelectrons.\n2. The measured quasiparticle mass accounts for the\nenhanced speci\fc heat.\nBoth these observations con\frm the success of Fermi-\nliquid theory.\n3. The Mystery of the Cuprate Superconduc-\ntors\nIf Fermi-liquid theory gives such a good account of the\nmetallic state, why look for alternatives? The reason is\nthe discovery of metals where the fermion quasiparticle\ndoes not seem to reflect the character of the measured\nlow energy eigenstates. In this sense, the electron (or\nelectron-like quasiparticle) may no longer be the appro-\npriate way to think of the low-lying excitations. The\nprime example is the metallic state of the copper oxide\nsuperconductors and so it seems \ftting to motivate the\nsearch for alternative theories of metals by summarizing\nthe puzzles presented by these materials.\nThe superconducting cuprates encompass almost\nthirty distinct crystalline structures (Shaked et al.\n1994) and contain upwards of three di\u000berent elements.\nThey are united by the common feature of a layer struc-\nture of CuO2 planes. In their pristine state these com-\npounds are typically not metals|they are insulators\nwith antiferromagnetic order. (The magnetic moment\non the copper site alternates in direction as you move\nfrom one site to its neighbour.) This in itself is a signa-\nture that the strength of the interaction between elec-\ntrons is important since simple electron counting in the\nabsence of interactions would suggest that these mate-\nrials should have a half \flled band and hence metallic\nproperties (see Box 2). In order to make these ma-\nterials metallic (and superconducting at low tempera-\ntures) one removes some electrons from each copper-\noxide layer by doping with another element which typ-\nically resides between the copper oxide planes. The\nantiferromagnetism then disappears and the material\nbecomes a metallic conductor.\nThe metallic behaviour that arises is characterized by\nsigni\fcant anisotropy. The electrical resistance perpen-\ndicular to the CuO2 plane direction can be up to one\nthousand times greater than that for currents carried in\nthe planes (Ito et al. 1991, Hussey 1998). Many peo-\nple have stressed the importance of the e\u000bectively two\ndimensional nature of the metallic cuprates and this is\nin part what has prompted the search for unusual met-\nals in low dimensions. As I have already hinted, the\nmetallic state itself is unusual. Space precludes a de-\ntailed analysis of all of the anomalous properties so I\nwill concentrate on just a few observations.\nNon-Fermi liquids A. J.

Optical measurements con\frm that this is due\nto a scattering rate which is proportional to tempera-\nture (Forro et al. 1990). While this is clearly di\u000berent\nfrom the T 2 scattering that Landau\u2019s theory might pre-\ndict, we should remember that the usual quasiparticle\nscattering only becomes apparent at very low temper-\natures which, in this case, is obscured from view by\nthe transition into the superconducting state. Electron-\nphonon scattering usually gives a linear resistivity from\nmoderate temperatures upwards (which is why we often\nuse the resistance of a platinum wire as thermometer).\nHowever in the case of the cuprates it seems that this\nscattering is purely electronic in origin since microwave\nmeasurements show the scattering rate plummeting on\nentering the superconducting state (Bonn et al. 1993).\nSo the measured resistivity presents us with two puz-\nzles: what causes the linear T scattering and how to\nexplain the absence of the phonon scattering?\nWe have discussed the scattering of electric currents\nbut one can also measure the scattering of currents gen-\nerated in a Hall e\u000bect experiment. Typically both elec-\ntric currents and Hall currents should measure the same\nscattering rate. In Fig. 9 we see that the scattering rate\nfrom Hall currents rises quadratically with the temper-\nature in absolute contradiction to the resistivity exper-\nNon-Fermi liquids A. J. Scho\feld 9\nBox 2. The tJ model\nIn the tJ model we imagine a highly simpli\fed view\nof a CuO2 plane. It starts from a picture of the parent\ninsulating compounds with a square lattice of single\natomic orbitals each with exactly one electron. The\nsystems is said to be half-\flled since the Pauli principle\nwould allow a maximum of two electrons in an orbital.\nNormally at half-\flling we would expect a metallic\nstate since any electron can move through the system\nto carry current by hopping onto a neighbouring site.\nNow we imagine turning on the inter-electron repulsion\nso that it becomes energetically unfavourable for more\nthan a single electron to occupy a given atomic site.\nNow the half-\flled case is an insulator because any\nelectron moving to a neighbouring site already \fnds\nan electron there and pays the price of the repulsive\ninteraction. There is an energy gap to make a current\ncarrying state and we have a \\Mott insulator\". This\nexplains the insulating nature of the parent cuprates.\nIn fact no electron really likes to be \fxed on a single\nsite|it\u2019s like being held in a small box and its kinetic\nenergy is high. This can be lowered if the electron\nmade \u2018virtual\u2019 tunnelling hops onto the neighbouring\noccupied sites and back. This the electron can only do\nif the neighbouring site has the opposite spin (the Pauli\nprinciple remains absolute). So we see that the inter-\nactions also favour the antiferromagnetic arrangement\nof spins seen in the parent compounds.\nThe tJ model describes what happens on\ndoping. We now remove some electrons so\nthat there are empty sites in the lattice:\nFigure B3: The tJ model describes the competition be-\ntween hole motion and antiferromagnetism in a doped\nMott insulator.\nThe system becomes a metal since electrons near empty\nsites can move without restraint (and lower their ki-\nnetic energy by an amount t. The neighbouring elec-\ntrons would still like to remain antiferromagnetically\naligned with strength J and at no time must any site\ncontain more than one electron. The presence of this\nconstraint means that there is no small parameter in\nthe theory with which one can perform perturbation\ntheory. This is the basic physics of the tJ model and,\nbecause the moving electrons disorder the magnetism,\nwe see that the t and the J represent competing inter-\nactions. While there are many fascinating proposals\nfor understanding the physics of this model, there are\nfew de\fnitive results.\niments (Chien, Wang and Ong 1991). How can a single\nquasiparticle have two relaxation rates?\nFurthermore there is the puzzle of how many charge\ncarriers there are in these metals. Some experiments,\nlike penetration depth in the superconducting state\n(Uemura et al. 1991), suggest a number proportional\nto the (small) number of holes made by doping the in-\nsulating state. Yet other experiments such as angle-\nresolved photo-emission see a Fermi surface containing\nthe large total number of conduction electrons in the\nsystem (Campuzano et al. 1990).\nThe proposed solutions to these questions remain\nhighly controversial and have led to some very exciting\nand far reaching ideas which, even if they don\u2019t ulti-\nmately \fnd ful\fllment in the physics of the cuprates,\nwill certainly resurface in the physics of other com-\npounds. What makes the subject exciting and at the\nsame time di\u000ecult is the absence so far of any solv-\nable model describing how interactions give rise to the\nmetallic state of the cuprates. The simplest model we\nhave is the so called tJ model (see Box 2) for which no\nsolution exists outside one dimension (see later).\nOne might be surprised that I have underplayed the\nrelatively large values of the superconducting transition\ntemperature for which the high temperature supercon-\nductors received that epithet. This is not because the\nsuperconductivity is not important or unusual. [These\nare the \frst materials where the superconducting order\nparameter has been established to have a symmetry\ndi\u000berent from the usual s wave form (see Annett et al.\n1996).] It is because the understanding of superconduc-\ntivity usually requires an understanding of the metallic\nstate from which it forms. We should note that our un-\nderstanding of conventional superconductivity relies on\na Fermi-liquid starting point. The pairing instability is\na consequence of the sharp discontinuity in occupation\nat the Fermi surface which the fermion quasiparticle\npicture provides (Bardeen, Cooper and Schrie\u000ber 1957).\nThe cuprates are not alone in exhibiting superconduc-\ntivity from an unusual metallic state.

This measures the scattering\nrate for Hall currents and shows it to be proportional\nto T 2. This is in marked contrast to the scattering of\nelectric currents which is proportional to T . The puz-\nzle is how can a single quasiparticle have two distinct\nscattering rates?\nuranium alloy, UBe13, which shows superconductivity\n(Ott et al. 1983, Bucher et al. 1973) but with little\nevidence of a well formed metallic Fermi-liquid state.\nIt is clear that the properties of new superconductors\nand their unusual metallic states are intimately linked.\nIf the task is to \fnd new descriptions of the metallic\nstate, where should we begin? There have been many\nspeculative suggestions, but in this article I want to\nfocus on examples of non-Fermi liquids which we be-\nlieve we do understand at least from a theoretical view\npoint. In fact all four of the examples I will discuss have\nbeen applied (loosely in some cases) to account for the\nphysics of the cuprates or uranium alloys. These exam-\nples show a great richness in behaviour although they\nmay appear at \frst sight to be rather arti\fcial \u2018toy\u2019\nmodels. This is a consequence of our lack of the math-\nematical tools with which to treat problems where the\ninteraction between electrons is strong and the tools\nthat we do have are often only applicable to systems in\nreduced dimensions. However, the ingenuity of mate-\nrial scientists means that these toy systems can often\nbe realized in nature by the clever tailoring of mate-\nrials. Whereas in the past the theoretical physicist\u2019s\njob has often involved \fnding the simple model that\nbest describes the physics of a complex material, now\nwe have the exciting possibility of the material scien-\ntist developing materials to demonstrate the theorist\u2019s\nmodel.\nSince we are here concerned with the failure of Fermi-\nliquid theory, it is as well to mention one clear example\nwhere adiabatic continuity breaks down. Once level\ncrossings occur in the spectrum then it is no longer\npossible to follow the labels through from the non-\ninteracting case. Typically this happens when there is\na phase transition in the system such as the formation\nof a superconducting state when electron bound states\nare favoured. In this review we will be primarily inter-\nested in how the Fermi liquid can fail within the normal\nmetallic state so we will not be considering such phase\ntransitions. However, our \frst example of a non-Fermi\nliquid will be one where the approach to a phase tran-\nsition can disrupt the Fermi-liquid state by destroying\nthe Landau quasiparticle.\n4. Metals near a quantum critical point: de-\nstroying the Landau quasiparticle\nIn our discussion of Landau\u2019s approach we showed that\na quasiparticle close to the Fermi surface was a long\nlived eigenstates by determining the decay rate. In do-\ning this we assumed that the matrix elements for scat-\ntering were independent of the momentum and energy\ntransfered. The Pauli principle con\fnes all scattering\nparticles to the vicinity of the Fermi surface so there is\nlittle scope for large transfers of energy in scattering. In\nthe limit of small energy transfer our assumption is of-\nten valid. However, when a system approaches a second\norder phase transition we know that fluctuations of the\norder parameter slow down and occur over increasingly\nlong wavelengths. A moving quasiparticle can then eas-\nily generate a large disturbance in the medium which\ncan, in turn, a\u000bect other quasiparticles in the vicin-\nity dramatically enhancing the scattering cross-section.\nThis e\u000bect is limited by the ordering temperature which\nlocks the fluctuations into a long range ordered state.\nBelow this temperature again our initial assumptions\nremain valid and the Landau quasiparticle is saved. Re-\ncently much work (both theoretical and, as we will see,\nexperimental) has explored phase transitions occurring\nat T = 0K (Hertz 1976, Moriya 1985, Millis 1993).\nWhile the types of phase transition will be familiar (for\nexample from a paramagnetic to a magnetic state) they\nare unusual in that Nernst\u2019s theorem tells us that the\nentropy should always be zero at zero temperature. A\nzero temperature phase transition must therefore be a\ntransition between two ordered states. For our pur-\nposes the most important feature will be that the quasi-\nparticle scattering-cross section can now grow without\nlimit ultimately destroying the consistency of Landau\u2019s\nFermi liquid picture.\nNon-Fermi liquids A. J. Scho\feld 11\nA zero temperature phase transitions occurs at a\nquantum critical point|so called because quantum me-\nchanics determines the fluctuations of the order param-\neter. It turns out that some of the physical properties\nnear a zero temperature phase transition can be de-\ntermined simply by using Fermi\u2019s golden rule, together\nwith the appropriate matrix elements. The matrix el-\nement encapsulates the scattering mechanism (in this\ncase the long range fluctuations of the order parameter\nwhich is trying to develop at the phase transition). In\nfact I use the example of the magnetic interaction be-\ntween moving charges because the matrix elements can\nbe computed from Maxwell\u2019s equations. (It turns out\nthat the matrix elements are the same as those near a\nzero temperature transition to a ferromagnetic state.)\nThe following section is meant for those readers who\nwould like to see where some of the non-Fermi liquid\nproperties come from. However, it may be omitted if\nyou just want to know the \fnal results.\nProperties near a quantum critical point\nTo see in some detail how Landau\u2019s original argument\nis spoiled near a quantum critical point we must revisit\nour Fermi golden rule expression for the decay rate. I\nwill now do a change of variable and express the same\nquantity as Eq. 6 in terms of the momentum and energy\ntransferred in any scattering process.

The appearance\nof ! in the lower limit of the momentum integral, q,\nappears because a minimum momentum must be trans-\nfered to give a change in energy of !. The integration\nover the direction of the momentum has already been\nperformed and gives the factor of (\u0016hvF q)2 in the denom-\ninator reflecting the increased time available for small\ndeflections. Finally D(q; !) is the matrix element for\nthe scattering process. If this is independent of q and\n! then the q integral is not sensitive to the value of the\nlower limit and is independent of !. The subsequent\nintegration over ! recovers the usual \u001c\u22121\u000f \u0018 gF \u000f2 result\nwe had before.\nAlready at this point we can see that something inter-\nesting happens in one dimension (d = 1). The singular\nnature of the q integral, even when the matrix element\nD(q; !) is constant, leads to a decay proportional to\n\u000f to this order. This is a signal of the breakdown in\nadiabatic continuity since there is no limit when the\nquasiparticle energy is well de\fned: There are no one\ndimensional Fermi liquids! We will discuss the nature\nof metals that do arise in d = 1 later. In higher dimen-\nsions we need to make D(q; !) more singular at low q\nin order to destabilize the Fermi liquid by this route.\nSingular interactions are a consequence of long\nrange force laws (large distances correspond to small\nwavenumbers in reciprocal space). The usual Coulomb\nforce itself adds to the Hamiltonian a term:\n\u001ae(~r)\u001ae(~r0)\n4\u0019\u000f0j~r \u2212 ~r0j \u2212!

This has\nexactly the sort of singularity at small q one might ex-\npect to destabilize the Fermi liquid. In fact the Fermi\nliquid remains stable because the collective behaviour of\nthe other electrons screens the long range Coulomb re-\npulsion. Any local build up of charge causes the nearby\nelectrons move away revealing more of the background\nlattice of positive ions. This neutralizes the charge\nbuild up beyond the Debye-Hu\u00a8ckel screening length\n\u0018 \u0018 p\u000f0=2\u0019e2gF (Debye and Hu\u00a8ckel 1923). Thus our\nonce long-ranged interaction is actually a short dis-\ntance Yukawa-type potential and is perfectly innocuous\nas far as the quasiparticle is concerned.

These forces\nturn out to be much weaker than the Coulomb law and\ntheir danger is only apparent at extremely low energies\nand hence at inaccessibly low temperatures. However\nan almost identical form of matrix element arises near a\nferromagnetic quantum critical point and this is exper-\nimentally realizable. Since deriving the matrix element\nat a quantum critical point is beyond the scope of this\narticle, I will use the Amperean interaction as my exam-\nple of a singular interaction. In this case seeing why the\nforce law is singular is a straight-forward application of\nMaxwell\u2019s equations.\nThe interaction between moving charges is due to the\nlocal magnetization which they set up. In the case of\nthe Coulomb interaction the potential energy term in\nthe Hamiltonian is just \u001e(~r)\u001ae(~r): the charge density\ntimes the electrostatic potential. The term we need\nfor the Amperean force law is the product of the local\nNon-Fermi liquids A. J. Scho\feld 12\ncurrent density and the vector potential: ~A(~r)\u0001~j(~r).

For the Amperean\ninteraction, the quasiparticle scattering cross section\ngrows without the limit and this destroys the Fermi liq-\nuid. Since this type of interaction is always present in\na metal, why is Fermi-liquid theory a good description\nof any metal? The answer lies in the overall scale of the\ninteraction.

In a clean metal with\nno impurities the conductivity is limited, not by the\nmean-free-path, but by the wavevector: \u001b \u0018 1=q. The\nskin depth enters the so-called anomalous regime and\nbehaves like\np\n!=q and this is the case we will con-\nsider. Doing the integral of Eq. 8 may look tricky but\nthe singular nature makes everything simple. We are\nonly trying to extract the energy dependence of the de-\ncay rate so we will neglect the prefactors. We note that\nas q decreases then DAmp grows as 1=q2 until q be-\ncomes smaller than the inverse skin depth when DAmp\nsaturates. This happens when q2 \u0018 !=q (i.e. when\nq \u0018 !1=3). Since !1=3 is always greater than the lower\nlimit of the integral (!) as ! ! 0 we can use it as the\nlower limit. We can then \fnd the energy dependence\nof the scattering rate by considering\n1\n\u001c\u000f\n\u0018\nZ \u000f\n0\n!d!\nZ\n!1=3\nqd\u22121dq\nq2\n\u0012\n1\nq2\n\u00132\n; (15)\n\u0018 \u000f \u0018 T for d = 3 at temperature T :(16)\nThere is now no regime where the Landau quasipar-\nticle is su\u000eciently long-lived to count as an approxi-\nmate eigenstate. In the language of adiabatic conti-\nnuity, switching on the interaction adiabatically takes\nlonger than the lifetime of the eigenstate itself and so\none can never continue from the non-interacting state\nto the interacting one. When the scattering rate goes\nlinearly to zero with the energy as in this case, we have\na \u2018marginal Fermi liquid\u2019 (Varma et al. 1989).\nSurprisingly, despite the absence of quasiparticles, we\ncan still use this calculation to determine some prop-\nerties of this non-Fermi liquid metal: the temperature\ndependence of the resistivities and heat capacity. The\ndecay rate (which is related to the resistivity) and the\ne\u000bective mass (which gives the heat capacity) are in-\nextricably linked in this example. This is because the\nscattering of quasiparticles can not help but produce\nsome back-flow which contributes to the e\u000bective mass\nand the quasiparticle energy. The decay rate may be\nviewed as an imaginary component of the energy in\nthe time evolution of the wavefunction \u0018 exp(\u2212i\u000ft=\u0016h).\nWhen the decay rate is non-analytic as \u000f ! 0 then\none can obtain the real part from the imaginary part\nthrough the Kramers-Kronig relation. The essence of\nthis is that if the quasiparticle scattering rate is T\u000b\n(with \u000b some fractional power), the heat capacity also\nhas a T\u000b dependence. In the case we have just consid-\nered \u000b = 1. This is non-analytic at the origin since,\nas a decay rate is always positive, it should really be\n\u001c\u22121\u000f \u0018 j\u000fj. In that case the heat capacity become T lnT .\nSo we have a logarithmic correction to the usual linear\nin T speci\fc heat capacity.\nThe other quantity which we can compute is the\nresistivity. One might be tempted to conclude that,\nsince the scattering rate is linear in temperature, then\nthe resistivity should also proportional to temperature.\nHowever this fails to account for the e\u000bectiveness of\nthe scattering at destroying electrical current. Small q\nNon-Fermi liquids A. J. Scho\feld 13\nscattering may destroy the quasiparticle but it is not\ne\u000bective at removing momentum from the net flow of\ncurrent. For that to happen large angle scattering must\noccur. The transport lifetime takes this into account\nand is obtained from the same expression as Eq. 8 with\nan additional factor of (1 \u2212 cos \u0012) \u0018 q2=k2F where \u0012\nis the scattering angle. Doing this above gives a re-\nsistivity of T 5=3 - a stronger temperature dependence\nthan the usual T 2 in a Fermi liquid. The other quan-\ntity we have discussed, the Pauli susceptibility, can not\nbe obtained from our Fermi golden rule expression and\nrequires more analysis to obtain.\nExamples of quantum critical points\nSummarizing these results, we have shown how the in-\nteractions between currents will ultimately destroy the\nFermi-liquid state in any metal at very low tempera-\ntures. The new behaviour that we expect to see in-\ncludes\n\u000f a marginal quasiparticle scattering rate: \u001c\u22121\u000f \u0018 \u000f \u0018\nT ,\n\u000f CV \u0018 T lnT ,\n\u000f \u001f \u0018 lnT (not proved here),\n\u000f \u001a(T ) \u0018 T 5=3.\nIt is a curious paradox that, while Landau\u2019s arguments\nwould suggest that the Fermi-liquid description is valid\nin the low temperature limit, interactions like this actu-\nally provide a low temperature bound on its stability.\nThe Kohn-Luttinger instability (Kohn and Luttinger\n1965) to a superconducting state similarly acts in a gen-\neral way to prevent one ever obtaining a T = 0 Fermi\nliquid. In most metals these e\u000bects are unobservable,\nbut there are a growing number of cases where new\ntypes of singular interactions can lead to a non-Fermi\nliquid state which is observed. I\u2019ve already indicated\nthat metals near a quantum critical point provide us\nwith such examples and so too do electrons in a half-\n\flled Landau level and I will now discuss what can be\nseen in experiment.\nWhen a metal is on the verge of a ferromagnetic insta-\nbility then one \fnds that the e\u000bective interactions be-\ntween quasiparticles have exactly the same form as they\ndo in the Amperean case we\u2019ve just considered. One ex-\nample of this is in the compound MnSi (Pfleiderer et al.\n1997). It becomes an almost ferromagnetic helical mag-\nnet at 30K but under pressure this Curie temperature\nis lowered, until at 14800 atmospheres the magnetism\nhas been completely \u2018squeezed\u2019 out of the system. It\nhas not yet been possible to measure the heat capacity\nunder such extreme conditions but resistivity measure-\nments can be done.

When this phase transition is\npushed to absolute zero we have a true quantum crit-\nical point and this divergence proceeds without limit.\nThe resistivity takes on the new T 5=3 form we proved\nearlier. Similar behaviour has also been seen in high\npressure experiments on ZrZn2|another ferromagnet\nwith a low Curie temperature (Grosche et al. 1995).\nThere are a number of other known non-Fermi liquids\nwhich arise from singular interactions. A very simi-\nlar form of interaction occurs when a two dimensional\nelectron gas is subjected to high magnetic \felds, but it\ncomes from quite a di\u000berent source. This perhaps is the\nmost unusual Fermi liquid we know, although again the\nsingular interactions imply that it is not truly a Fermi\nliquid at the lowest temperatures.\nAt high magnetic \felds we see the fractional quantum\nHall e\u000bect (Tsui, Sto\u00a8rmer and Gossard 1982). Electrons\nin a magnetic \feld and con\fned to two dimensions de-\nvelop a discrete quantized energy spectrum where each\nlevel can hold a macroscopic number of particles| a\nnumber which depends on the strength of the magnetic\n\feld. When the lowest energy level is partially \flled by\na fraction with an an odd denominator (like 1\/3 full),\nthe ground state shows unusual stability. The Hall ef-\nfect develops a a plateau and becomes independent of\na \feld for a small range of nearby \felds as the elec-\ntron fluid is reluctant to move away from this stable\npoint. The excitations of this insulating state carry\nfractions of the electronic charge (Laughlin 1983) and\nare a fascinating area of active research which I won\u2019t\nNon-Fermi liquids A. J.

Not only do we see non-Fermi liquid behaviour\nhere but also there is a superconducting transition (af-\nter Julian et al. 1996, Mathur et al. 1998)\ndetail here as I am concentrating on metallic states.\nThe ground state can be thought of as being formed\nfrom bound states of electrons with quanta of flux (Jain\n1989 and 1992) making \u2018composite fermions\u2019. What-\never magnetic \feld is left unbound after the compos-\nite fermions form, is the e\u000bective \feld experienced by\nthe composite fermions. They then undergo a conven-\ntional integer quantum Hall e\u000bect. Between the quan-\ntum Hall plateaux the electron gas passes through a\nmetallic phase. When the lowest energy level is ex-\nactly half \flled the composite fermions try to form a\nmetallic state where there is no e\u000bective \feld remain-\ning. We then have a Fermi liquid of composite fermions\n(Halperin, Lee and Read 1993). The residual interac-\ntions in this metal can also have a singular form and so\na\u000bect its properties. These come from an interaction\nbetween currents and charge density which is left over\nfrom approximations of binding magnetic flux to the\nunderlying electrons. This type of interaction (coupling\na vector to a scalar) is not usually allowed in a metal\nbut occurs here in the presence of a magnetic \feld. It\nis the absence of a long range interaction (which would\notherwise suppress the fluctuations of density) that can\ncauses the e\u000bective coupling to be singular. Neverthe-\nless one sees strong evidence for a well formed Fermi\nliquid in the experiments (Willett 1997).\nPerhaps the most puzzling of the systems with a sin-\ngular interaction are antiferromagnetic quantum criti-\n0 20 40 60 80\n0\n20\n40\n60\n0 8\n0\n15\nR\nes\nis\nti\nv\nit\ny\n\/\n[\ncm\n]\nmW\nT \/K1.21.2\nT \/K1.21.2\nr \n\/ [\nmW\ncm\n]\nFigure 12: The resistivity of CePd2Si2 at the critical\npressure (28 kbar).

There exist a growing family of metals with\nvery low Ne\u0013el temperatures below which antiferromag-\nnetic order develops. An example is CePd2Si2 where\nthe Ne\u0013el temperature can be squeezed to zero in pres-\nsures of 28000 atmospheres (see Fig. 11). Similar argu-\nments to those presented above can be used to compute\nthe expected temperature dependence of the resistiv-\nity: it turns out to be T 3=2. However, unlike the fer-\nromagnetic case, the power law that is observed is T 1:2\n(Grosche et al. 1996) (see Fig. 12). Why this should be\nis presently not understood but is potentially a question\nof fundamental importance. The cuprate superconduc-\ntors are also systems close to antiferromagnetism as we\nhave seen, and it has been argued that these two puz-\nzling phenomenon are linked. Tantalizingly, this system\nand others close to antiferromagnetism (Mathur et al.\n1998) also show superconductivity at the quantum crit-\nical point lending weight to a connection between this\ntype of quantum critical point and the cuprates. How-\never the superconducting transition is at 0.4 K which\nleaves this scenario needing to explain why Tc is so high\nin the cuprates.\nIn our discussion thus far we have used only the resis-\ntivity as the signature of non-Fermi liquid physics. Pri-\nmarily, this is because all of the above materials require\npressures so high to reach the critical point that ther-\nmodynamic measurements (e.g. speci\fc heat or Pauli\nsusceptibility) are rather di\u000ecult. This can be over-\ncome by using doping rather than pressure to tune the\nmetal to a quantum critical point. One such exam-\nple is CeCu6\u2212xAux (see von Lo\u00a8hneysen 1996) which\nis paramagnetic with x = 0 but on adding a small\nmount (x = 0:1) of gold, the metal develops antifer-\nromagnetism (see Fig. 13).

The danger with doping\nas a tuning mechanism is that the metals are now o\u000b\nstoichiometry and, as such, one must wonder about the\nrole of disorder near the critical point. This is theoreti-\ncally an open problem. Nevertheless, the experimental\nsituation is clear: we have a well tried route to the\nnon-Fermi liquid at a quantum critical point.\nIf all that was known about non-Fermi liquids was\nhow the quasiparticle could be destroyed by singular\ninteractions, we would seem to have found only the\nexception to prove the general rule. However in one\ndimension we see a radical new type of metallic be-\nhaviour where completely new types of particle emerge\nto replace Landau\u2019s Fermi quasiparticle.\n5. Luttinger Liquid: the Bose Quasiparticle\nWe have already seen that our general scattering rate\nargument would predict an absence of Fermi liquids in\none dimension even with a constant matrix element.\nConsidering higher order terms only makes matters\nworse. All is not lost however, for a new type of adi-\nabatic continuity has been proposed by Haldane (Hal-\ndane 1981) which gives us the possibility of quantify-\ning the new metallic state that emerges in its place:\n1\n2\n0.04 0.1 1 4\nT\/K\nC\n\/T\n\/(\nJ\/\nm\no\nl\nK\n)\n2\nFigure 14: The speci\fc heat of CeCu5:9Au0:1 at the\nquantum critical point.

In fact many systems, from the \\blue\nbronze\" molybdenum alloys to some organic Bechgaard\nsalts have properties which are highly anisotropic. Elec-\ntron motion is essentially con\fned to one dimension by\nthe very low probability of the electron hopping in the\ntwo remaining directions. It is in this type of system\nthat we have the possibility of seeing a Luttinger liquid\nstate develop.\nIf the essence of the Fermi liquid was the Landau\nquasiparticle, then the essence of the Luttinger liquid\nis spin-charge separation and the appearance of spinon\nand holon quasiparticles. Their existence relies on a\nvery special property of one dimensional systems: near\nthe Fermi surface all particle-hole excitations at \fxed\nmomentum have the same kinetic energy. This is illus-\ntrated in Fig. 15 where we see that in two (and higher\ndimensions) the energy depends both on the magni-\ntude of q and on its direction relative to the local Fermi\nsurface. In one dimension there is only one direction\nand so \fxing q determines the energy completely. This\nNon-Fermi liquids A. J.

This leads to density waves be-\ning the proper description of physics in one dimension.\nis important because adding together the all possible\nparticle-hole excitations with a speci\fc excitation mo-\nmentum ~q gives the wavefunction for a density wave: a\ncompression and rarefraction of electron density with a\nwavelength 2\u0019=j~qj. The special property of one dimen-\nsion means that here a density wave has a well-de\fned\nkinetic energy. Now the potential energy is also usu-\nally determined by the density of particles with a given\nwavelength (see for example the Coulomb interaction of\nEq. 10) and so the density wave also has a well de\fned\npotential energy. This is enough to tell us that density\nwaves form the new eigenstates of the one dimensional\nmetal. More generally the potential energy can depend\non both the density of spin and the density of charge,\nso spin density waves may have a di\u000berent energy from\ncharge density waves. Thus the good quantum num-\nbers of the system are those of spin and charge density.\nSo we can completely by-pass the problem of how the\nelectrons behave by working only with the densities.\nThis leads to the remarkable phenomenon of spin-\ncharge separation. The electron carries with it both\nspin (its magnetic moment) and its electrical charge.\nIn one dimension these can, and generally do, become\ntwo separate entities which move independently as they\nform the spin and charge density eigenstates. The elec-\ntron dissolves into its spin part (a spinon) and its charge\npart (a holon). Its clearly not a Fermi liquid any more\nbecause the good quantum numbers look nothing like\nthe old fermion quasiparticle labels. If we ask where the\noriginal electron has gone by determining the spectral\nfunction, we no longer see the single sharp quasiparti-\ncle peak of the Fermi liquid. Instead we see two sharp\nfeatures characterizing the spin and charge parts of the\nv k v k\nFigure 16: The spectral function of a one dimensional\nLuttinger liquid. Notice how, in contrast to the Fermi\nliquid (Fig. 5), there are now two singular features cor-\nresponding to the spinon and holon and they generally\ndisperse with di\u000berent velocities, v\u001b and v\u001a (after Voit\n1993 and Dias 1996).\nelectron moving with di\u000bering velocities (see Fig. 16).\nOne can make a very simple picture of how this hap-\npens by considering a single electron in a Mott insu-\nlating state. This is illustrated in Fig. 17 where we\nconsider the physics of the tJ model (Box 2) but now\nin one dimension. Starting with the insulating state we\nhave an antiferromagnetic arrangement of spins. Now\nwe remove an electron which of course removes both a\nspin and leaves behind a charged state. As the hole now\nmoves we note that the place where the disruption in\nthe spin arrangement and the position of the hole have\nnow moved apart. The spin and charge of the original\nelectron have separated and formed independent enti-\nties.\nThis type of picture has, for many years, seemed\nno more than a na\u00a8\u0010ve picture of a phenomenon whose\nproper description requires the powerful mathematical\nmachinery of bosonization. (This is the technique which\nformally expresses the problem in terms of spin and\ncharge densities.) However, very recently exactly the\nexperiment described above has been done on the an-\ntiferromagnetic chain compound SrCuO2 (Kim et al.\n1996). A single electron is removed from the chain by\na photo-emission process whereby an incident photon\nkicks out an electron. The probability for doing so\ndepends on the underlying dynamics of the spin and\ncharge degrees of freedom we excite. Since this starts\nas an insulating system the dynamics of the hole are\nthe dynamics of an almost empty band. The allowed\nmomentum of the spinon is restricted by the magnetic\norder. The spectrum that is seen is shown in Fig. 18d.\nFor some momenta of the photo-electron, only the holon\nis allowed to carry the momentum away and one sees\nNon-Fermi liquids A. J.

In reality scattering from near one\nFermi surface point to the other side (Fig. 19a) or dis-\npersion curvature as one moves away from the Fermi\npoints (Fig. 19b) means that the momentum of the\nparticle-hole excitation no longer uniquely determines\nthe energy.

Part of the supporting\nexperimental evidence which he appeals to is the two\nseparate scattering rates measured in the decay of elec-\ntrical and Hall currents. These he attributes to the\ndecay of holons and spinons respectively. While this\nproposal remains controversial, the idea of spin-charge\nseparation in more than one dimension is a very active\nresearch area at present.\n6. Two-channel Kondo model: novel quasipar-\nticles\nThus far we have had Fermi quasiparticles (in the Fermi\nliquid), Bose quasiparticles (in the Luttinger liquid)\nand no quasiparticles at all near a quantum critical\npoint. That might be expected to exhaust the possi-\nbilities! In fact in low dimensional systems there can\nexist excitations which fall outside these classes. I have\nalready mentioned the possibility of particles carrying\nfractional charge in the fractional quantum Hall e\u000bect.\nThe excitations of these systems in two dimensions have\nquantum statistics that can lie in between fermions and\nbosons. Under particle exchange these particles acquire\na more general phase factor (ei\u0012) in contrast to the usual\n\u00061 for bosons\/fermions and are known as \\anyons\"|\nfor \u2018any statistics\u2019 (Leinaas and Myrheim 1977)!\nInteractions then can lead to completely new types\nof state appearing at low energies. Rather than use\nanyons as an example, I will discuss the appearance of\na new type of excitation in a metal in the \\two channel\nKondo\" problem. The strange particle in this problem\nis essentially \\half of a spin-half\" degree of freedom.\nKondo models have for many years been a favourite\nof condensed matter theorists and the single channel\nKondo model is described in Box 1.\nIf the physics of the single-channel Kondo model is\nthat of a local Fermi liquid, then the two-channel case\nis the physics of the local non-Fermi liquid. In the two-\nchannel case, one imagines a single spin one-half im-\npurity which interacts antiferromagnetically with two\nconduction seas of electrons (hence the two channels)\nwhich do not otherwise interact (Nozi\u0012eres and Blandin\n1980). The conduction electrons are totally oblivious of\nthe other sea of electrons and do not even experience a\nPauli exclusion principle from them. Only the impurity\nsees that there are two channels. Experimentally this is\nhard to realize as described above, but there are claims\nthat tunneling experiments through certain two level\nsystems can be modeled in a very similar way (Ralph\net al. 1994).\nThe extra complication of two conduction channels\ndoes little to a\u000bect the physics at high temperatures.\nFor weak coupling one has a free spin one-half object\nwhich scatters both channels of electrons and results\nin the same logarithmically growing scattering as the\ntemperature is lowered. However, as the coupling con-\nstant grows, the impurity spin has a problem. It would\nlike to form a singlet but the symmetry of the problem\nforbids it from favouring any one of the channels for\nNon-Fermi liquids A. J. Scho\feld 19\nFigure 20: In the two-channel Kondo problem, a single\nmagnetic impurity interacts with two orthogonal elec-\ntron wavefunctions. The magnetic ion can no longer\nmake the usual non-magnetic singlet state at low tem-\nperatures because the symmetry of the problem makes\nfavouring one electron over the other impossible. A\nmagnetic state can still undergo further Kondo scatter-\ning. The resulting ground state bears no resemblance\nto a non-interacting gas of electrons and is a local non-\nFermi liquid.\nmaking that singlet. The other possibility is to make a\nlinear superposition of a singlet with each channel, but\nthis leaves the unbound spin of the spectator channel\ncarrying a two-fold spin degeneracy. It turns out that\nthis then would behave like a new spin-half impurity\nwhich in turn wants to undergo another Kondo e\u000bect\n(see Fig. 20). There is no simple solution to the impu-\nrity spin\u2019s dilemma. Solving the problem requires the\napplication of conformal \feld theory techniques (Af-\nfleck and Ludwig 1991) and the \u2018Bethe Ansatz\u2019(Andrei\nand Destri 1984, Tsvelik and Wiegmann 1985)|a class\nof wave functions which solve a number of interacting\nlow dimensional problems. The mathematical complex-\nity of these solutions forbids detailed discussion of them\nhere. There do exist a number of \u2018simpli\fed\u2019 treatments\n(Emery and Kivelson 1992, Sengupata and Georges\n1994, Coleman Io\u000be and Tsvelik 1995) which reformu-\nlate the two-channel Kondo model (see Scho\feld 1997)\nand make the physical properties obtainable from per-\nturbation theory. What emerges can be seen from\nthe calculated temperature dependence of the impu-\nrity spin\u2019s entropy. In the single-channel Kondo model\nthis falls smoothly from ln 2 reflecting the two degrees\nof freedom of the free spin, to 0 at very low temper-\natures. In the two-channel case the entropy also falls\nfrom ln 2. However it saturates at 12 ln 2 at low temper-\natures as if a\np\n2 degree of freedom is left. It transpires\nthat this object can be represented rather simply as the\nreal part of the normally complex electron|a so-called\nMajorana fermion named after Majorana\u2019s purely real\nrepresentation of the Dirac equation (Majorana 1937).\nIt remains free at low temperatures and disrupts the\nlocal Fermi liquid one had in the single-channel case.\nNew power laws emerge for the impurity spin contri-\nbution to the low temperature properties: heat capacity\n\u0018 T lnT , Pauli susceptibility \u0018 lnT and the resistiv-\nity has a\np\nT correction. While it is hard to make a\nstraightforward application of this model to a physical\nsystem, there have been a number of proposals suggest-\ning that this physics can be realized in certain uranium\nalloys (Cox 1987) as well as in the various tunnelling\nproblems mentioned before. In fact strange power laws\nare seen in a number of uranium alloys (see , for exam-\nple, Maple at al. 1996), but the two-channel Kondo\ninterpretation remains controversial. Nevertheless it\nprovides us theoretically with the intriguing possibil-\nity that the physics of non-Fermi liquids may lead to\ncompletely new kinds of low energy particle controlling\nthe behaviour of exotic metals.\n7. The disordered Kondo scenario\nIn our survey of non-Fermi liquids I have deliberately\ntried to choose examples which are stoichiometric - that\nis where a pure crystal exhibits an unusual metallic\nstate. The reason for doing this has been to isolate the\nrole of disorder which further complicates our picture\nof non-Fermi liquid alloyed materials. Although there\nexist many powerful techniques for dealing with dis-\norder in condensed matter physics, they unfortunately\nare not easily extended to include the e\u000bect of interac-\ntions. Having said that, there are in fact many more\nexamples of non-Fermi liquid metals which one might\nclaim to be disordered. Almost all of the cuprates are\nmade by partially substituting one atom for another in\nthe process of doping the Mott insulating state. (The\nreason that we believe that these are in fact clean ma-\nterials is because the copper oxide planes|where the\naction is taking place|are left unscathed by the dop-\ning except for a change in carrier density.) There exist\nalso a growing number of diluted alloys of uranium and\ncerium which also exhibit non-Fermi liquid behaviour.\nSome have been interpreted in terms of the two-channel\nKondo scenario mentioned above. There is, however, at\nleast one other possibility, namely that the non-Fermi\nliquid behaviour is coming from single channel Kondo\nNon-Fermi liquids A. J. Scho\feld 20\nimpurities but the disorder creates a distribution of\nKondo temperatures (Bernal et al. 1995, Miranda, Do-\nbrosavljevi\u0013c and Kotliar 1997). One such example is\nUCu5\u2212xPdx (Bernal et al. 1995) where one imagines\nthe magnetic uranium ions sitting in a random envi-\nronment of a Cu\/Pd alloy.\nI have argued that one such impurity favours a Fermi\nliquid (see Box 1) so why is it that a distribution of\nsuch impurities can lead to anything di\u000berent? The\nanswer lies in the fact that even relatively weak dis-\norder yields a fraction of the impurity spins with ex-\ntremely low Kondo temperatures and these magnetic\nmoments remain unquenched and strongly scatter the\nconduction electrons even at low temperatures. This\nis a consequence of the exponential dependence of the\nKondo temperature on the local properties of the im-\npurity spin:\nTK = D exp(\u2212\u0015) ; (17)\nwhere D is the bandwidth of the conduction electrons\nand \u0015 is a measure of the local density of conduction\nelectronic states at the magnetic site and of the coupling\nbetween the moment and the conduction electrons.\nWe can perform a crude calculation of the non-Fermi\nliquid properties by assuming that the Kondo temper-\natures in the alloy are uniformly distributed between 0\nand an arbitrary scale, To. By using approximate forms\nfor the speci\fc heat, the resistivity and the suscepti-\nbility of a single Kondo impurity, we can then simply\naverage over the distribution of Kondo temperatures to\nobtain the bulk response. Our approximate forms will\nbe\nCimp \u0018 kB TKT\nT 2 + T 2K\n; (18)\n\u001fimp \u0018 \u0016\n2\nB\nT + TK\n; (19)\n\u001aimp \u0018\n\u001a\n0 T > TK ;\n\u001ao T \u0014 TK ; (20)\nThese have been chosen to capture the essence of\nthe results for the Kondo model shown graphically\nin Box 1 while obeying certain important constraints\n(such as the total impurity entropy\nR1\n0 Cimp=TdT be-\ning independent of TK .) Using a uniform distribu-\ntion of Kondo temperatures (P (TK)dTK = 1=To) we\ncan straight forwardly calculate the expected proper-\nties by averaging over the impurity distribution (eg.\nC(T ) \u0018 Nimp=To\nR To\n0\nCimpdTK). One \fnds that\nC(T ) \u0018 NimpkB T2To ln\n\u0012\n1 +\nT 2o\nT 2\n\u0013\n; (21)\n\u001f(T ) \u0018 Nimp\u0016\n2\nB\nTo\nln (1 + To=T ) ; (22)\n\u001a(T ) \u0018 \u001ao (1\u2212 T=To) for T < To : (23)\nWe see at once that the speci\fc heat and the suscepti-\nbility immediately adopt non-Fermi liquid forms at low\ntemperatures with C=T \u0018 \u001f \u0018 \u2212 lnT instead of T in-\ndependent. The rising resistivity as the temperature is\nlowered suggests disorder in the system as well as a low\nenergy scattering mechanism. Of course these results\ndepend to some extent on the distribution of Kondo\ntemperatures but, provided this distribution tends to a\n\fnite number (not zero) at low temperatures, the low\ntemperature forms are robust. In fact this type of be-\nhaviour has been seen in many alloyed materials (see\nMiranda, Dobrosavljevi\u0013c and Kotliar 1996 for a table).\nTo be sure that disorder is driving the non-Fermi\nliquid physics we would like some independent signa-\nture of it. This can come from nuclear magnetic res-\nonance (NMR) and muon spin rotation (\u0016SR) studies\n(MacLauglin, Bernal and Lukefahr 1996). These mea-\nsurements probe very precisely the local environment\nat particular atomic sites. What is found is that in\nUCu5\u2212xPdx the copper atoms appear to sit in a variety\nof local environments strongly suggesting the presence\nof disorder. These authors are even able to extract the\ndistribution of Kondo temperatures and show that it\ndoes satisfy the requirement of being \fnite at low tem-\nperatures, and is consistent with the measured heat ca-\npacity and susceptibilities. While this interpretation is\nnot universally accepted in this particular material (see,\nfor example, Aronson et al. 1996) it does serve as the\nsimplest example for a new route to non-Fermi liquid\nphysics when interactions and disorder combine.\n8. Conclusions\nThe discovery of the cuprate superconductors has\nsparked a widespread interest in materials which do not\nseem to lie with in the traditional Fermi-liquid frame-\nwork which we have relied on for understanding the\ne\u000bect of interactions in metals. What is emerging from\nthis is a striking richness in the types of metallic be-\nhaviour that can appear. We see metals where the\nelectron dissolves into its magnetic and electric com-\nponents and systems when no quasiparticle excitation\nis left. We also see the possibility of unusual states\nappearing which have no simple analogue outside in-\nteracting systems.\nIn this article I have attempted to give a flavour of\nsome of the ideas which are currently being explored\nboth to understand the cuprates but, often more fruit-\nfully, in understanding equally fascinating problems in\nother metallic compounds. It may well be that the so-\nlution to the mystery of the cuprate metals also lies in\nsome of the physics discussed here. However my suspi-\ncion is that nature is playing stranger tricks and that\nthere is a new theory of interacting metals just as pro-\nfound as Landau\u2019s picture of the metallic state that will\nNon-Fermi liquids A.
