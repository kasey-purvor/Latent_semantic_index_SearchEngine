The Experience of \nPolice-led Restorative Cautioning Pilots in Northern \nIreland. \n \nAbstract \nIn recent years there has been a considerable growth in the use of restorative justice \nschemes, particularly for young offenders. This article describes how two police-led \nrestorative cautioning pilots for juveniles operated in Northern Ireland. The pilots \nwere found to offer a number of distinct advantages over the traditional cautioning \npractice and helped secure some of the values of restorative justice. However, they \nwere not without fault and the research found evidence of \u2018net-widening\u2019, whereby \nsome offenders appeared to have been drawn into the schemes unnecessarily. It was \nalso evident that the schemes required significant resources in order to involve \nparticipants (particularly victims) and to operate effectively. In light of the \ngovernment\u2019s intention to greatly expand restorative practice in Northern Ireland \ngenerally, this article argues for the need to do so with care, if the quality of \nrestorative justice is not to be compromised. \n \nIntroduction \nIn recent years, restorative justice has been catapulted onto the international platform, \nwith many criminal justice schemes adopting various restorative processes in order to \naddress some of the traditional concerns voiced over the effectiveness of orthodox \ncriminal procedure.1 Most of these practices are based around John Braithwaite\u2019s \ntheory of reintegrative shaming (Braithwaite, 1989) which involves encouraging \noffenders to experience shame for their actions whilst allowing them to maintain their \ndignity. It endeavours to repair the relationship through a healing process designed to \nmeet the needs of victims, whilst also reintegrating the offender into society.  \n                                                 \n1 Such concerns often focus on the fact that victims tend to feel excluded from the process (Shapland, \nWillmore and Duff 1985; Elias, 1986); that the offender does not seriously participate (Dignan and \nLowey, 2000); and that outcomes are frequently unsatisfactory for both victims and offenders alike \n(McCold, 1996). \n 1\n Proponents of restorative schemes have argued that the conventional criminal justice \nsystem has been overly focused on \u201cpublic interest\u201d, which effectively amounted to \nthe state subsuming the interests of the other stakeholders. Restorative processes, on \nthe other hand, which aim to address the victim\u2019s material, emotional and \npsychological needs, seem to be perceived as procedurally fairer, with victims in \nparticular emerging from the process with more respect for the police and criminal \njustice system than those whose cases were processed by the formal courts (Sherman \nand Barnes, 1997).  \n \nOne model of restorative justice which is growing in popularity is that of police-based \nconferencing. Common in Australia, New Zealand, and parts of the USA and UK, \npolice-based conferences are designed as an alternative to formal prosecution. They \nprovide a forum for the police to bring together young offenders and their victims, \nwith their respective families and supporters. The conferences are generally \norganised, managed and facilitated by a police officer, and examine ways of providing \nredress to the victim and reintegrating the offender, although solutions are never \nimposed by the facilitator. The goals of police-conferencing are to encourage young \noffenders to achieve empathy towards their victim and assume responsibility for their \nactions, to allow victims to move towards forgiveness and healing, and to empower \ncitizens to address their own problems (McCold 1996; Moore and O\u2019Connell 1994; \nYoung and Goold 1999).  \n \n \nThis article gives an insight into the effectiveness of police-led juvenile conferencing \npilots in Northern Ireland.2 Following a major review of criminal justice and the \n                                                 \n2 The police in Northern Ireland have operated specialist Juvenile Liaison Schemes to deal with \njuveniles since 1975.  These were aimed at diverting young offenders away from prosecution through \nan extension of the system of cautioning, and specialist officers are used to review cases and decide \nhow they are best dealt with. The liaison schemes have largely been successful, in that the majority \n(over 90%) of juveniles referred to them are usually dealt with by means short of prosecution, such as \nby \u2018advice and warning\u2019, \u2018no further action\u2019 or by caution (O\u2019Mahony and Deazley 2000).   \n 2\npublication of the Criminal Justice Review in March 2000,3 the police instigated two \npilot schemes: one was based in Ballymena, County Antrim and the other in \nMountpottinger, Belfast. Both schemes adopted a restorative approach for dealing \nwith juveniles (under 17 years of age) who committed an offence, but were diverted \naway from prosecution by way of a formal caution, delivered using a restorative \nframework.  \n \nThis research is of interest for two main reasons. Firstly, it adds to the body of \nempirical studies evaluating various restorative justice schemes. Secondly, the \nresearch could inform the growth of emerging restorative practices for juveniles; in \nparticular the growth of such practices in Northern Ireland that form part of the \npackage of measures which the Government implemented in response to the Criminal \nJustice Review.4  These measures will lead to a considerable growth in restorative \nwork with juvenile offenders, beyond police led conferencing. It will be asked, in \nlight of the present findings which highlight a number of implications, both positive \nand negative, whether in the context of restorative justice \u2018more\u2019 is always better.  \n \n                                                 \n3 The Review Group was established as a result of  the Belfast Agreement of April 1998, as part of the \nattempts to ensure widespread participation in and acceptance of criminal justice institutions and \nprocesses in the province. \n4 In particular Part 4 of the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002 greatly expands the use of restorative \npractices throughout the criminal justice system for juveniles by way of \u2018youth conferencing\u2019, see \nconclusions below for more details.  \n 3\nThe Research \nThe fieldwork for this research study covered a period from September 2000 to April \n2001 in which all case files dealt with by the Juvenile Liaison Officers in two areas \nover the duration of the pilots were reviewed. The review explored the types of cases \nthat came to the attention of the Juvenile Liaison Officers and how cases were \ndisposed of, using, \u2018no further police action\u2019, \u2018advice and warning\u2019, \u2018caution\u2019 or \n\u2018prosecution\u2019.  \nThe researchers examined a total of 1,861 Juvenile Liaison referrals made between \nMay 1999 to September 2000, including 969 cases from Mountpottinger and 892 \nfrom Ballymena. Information gathered included the nature of the incident and the \noutcome of the case. The team also collected more detailed information about the \nbackgrounds of individuals and any previous contacts they had with the police from a \nrandom sample of 265 case files, including all cases dealt with by way of restorative \ncaution or conference (n = 70).5 The researchers observed a total of 29 restorative \nsessions during the period of the fieldwork, and conducted telephone interviews or \nsent out questionnaires to all past participants, to shed further light on the process \nfrom a \u2018consumer\u2019 viewpoint.  \n \n1. File Review: Profile and Outcome of Cases Referred to Juvenile Liaison \nOf the 1,861 police case files opened, it emerged that the majority of young people \nreferred to the Juvenile Liaison officers were boys (77%), mostly between 13 and 15 \nyears of age (see Table 1). Typically the cases referred involved relatively minor \ncriminal incidents, such as shoplifting or criminal damage and 95% of the cases \nrelated to a single incident or offence. However, just under a third (29%) were \nreferred for non-criminal incidents, such as a missing persons report, or \u2018general \nmisbehaviour\u2019(see Table 2).6     \n \n \n                                                 \n5 Restorative cautions did not directly involve a victim, while restorative conferences generally \ninvolved input from a victim. \n6 \u2018General misbehaviour\u2019 was used as a catch-all for any non-criminal act construed as a nuisance and \nincluded things like hanging about making noise, breaking bottles, causing a disturbance etc.  \n 4\n Table 1  \nAge and sex of Juvenile Liaison referrals - May1999 to September 2000 \n Mountpottinger Ballymena \nAge:  \n5-9 years \n \n6% \n \n5% \n10-13 36% 36% \n14-16 58% 59% \nSex: \nMale \n \n78% \n \n77% \nFemale 22% 23% \n   \nNumber 969 892 \n  \n 5\nTable 2 \nGrounds for referral to Juvenile Liaison - May1999 to September 2000 \n Mountpottinger Ballymena \nViolence  12% 12% \nSexual Offences 1% 2% \nBurglary 3% 4% \nRobbery * 0% \nTheft 19% 15% \nFraud\/Forgery 1% * \nCriminal Damage 13% 15% \nDrugs * 2% \nMotoring Offences 4% 3% \nDisorderly Behaviour 6% 7% \nTaking and Driving Away 2% 3% \nHarassment 1% * \nUnder Age Drinking 2% 6% \nOther Criminal 4% 5% \nMissing Person** 5% 6% \nGeneral Misbehaviour**  27% 20% \nNumber 969 892 \n* less than 1% \n**i.e. non-criminal matters - see footnote 6. \n \nOver half of the young people had not come to the attention of the police previously. \nOf those who had, most had been dealt with by \u2018advice and warning\u2019 or by \u2018no further \npolice action\u2019 (60%). Only 15% had a criminal record. The most common outcome \nfor a referral was \u2018advice and warning\u2019 or \u2018no further police action\u2019 (79%).

Disposals \nsuch as \u2018no further police action\u2019 and \u2018informal advice and warning\u2019 were used for \nvery minor offences, and many could not even be classed as criminal (such as a report \nof a missing person or for \u2018general misbehaviour\u2019). These cases tended to involve \nvery young juveniles (10-14 years), few of whom had been previously cautioned or \nprosecuted.  By contrast, those given traditional cautions were generally older, with \nthe majority (70%) being between 14 and 16 years of age. They were all dealt with for \ncriminal matters and unlike those above, two-thirds had been dealt with by the police \npreviously.  \n \nThose prosecuted generally had committed more serious offences, such as burglary, \nviolent offences, theft and criminal damage. Most of these juveniles had been \npreviously cautioned (66%) or prosecuted (67%) and 89% had been dealt with by the \npolice previously. Overall therefore, it was evident that disposal decisions were made \nappropriately, taking into account factors such as the seriousness of the incident, age \nof the young person and the number and nature of previous contacts with the police. \n \n \n 7\nRestorative Cases: General Profile \nOn examination of cases that were dealt with using a restorative model it was found \nthat there were clear differences in practice between the two pilot areas. In \nMountpottinger where the restorative scheme evolved from traditional cautioning \npractice,8 the sessions appeared to be used as an alternative to the traditional caution. \nHere, 39 of the 42 restorative cases were dealt with by way of a restorative caution \n(without the presence of the victim), and only three were dealt with by a restorative \nconference (including a victim). In Ballymena, however, the scheme had been \ndeveloped from a local \u2018retail theft initiative\u2019, and generally only dealt with \nshoplifting cases. Here, 25 of the 28 cases resulted in a restorative conference, though \nthese mostly used a surrogate victim who was drawn from a volunteer panel of local \nretailers and only three cases were dealt with by way of a restorative caution.9  \n  \nIt was evident from the cases we examined that the majority of conferences were not \nbeing used as an alternative to prosecution. Instead, they were used mostly for less \nserious cases involving young juveniles (12-14 years) that previously would not have \nresulted in formal action. For instance, over 90% of the restorative conference cases \nwere for minor thefts, and 80% of these involved goods with values under \u00a315. In \nover half the cases, goods were worth less than \u00a35. Indeed, the profile of those given \nrestorative cautions and conferences was more similar to those given \u2018advice and \nwarning\u2019 than those cautioned previously and they were not at all similar to those \nreferred for prosecution. This suggests a degree of net-widening was taking place \nwhich will be discussed in more depth below. \n \n \n                                                 \n8 The \u2018traditional\u2019 caution was usually administered by a senior police office at the station with the \nyoung person and their parents. It usually involved the young person being given a stern warning about \nthe consequences of any further offending. See Hoyle et al (2002) for a good description of traditional \ncautioning practice.  \n9 The distinction between restorative caution - not involving a victim, and restorative conference - \ninvolving a victim, was later removed by the police, with all restorative work being referred to as \nrestorative conferencing. \n 8\nRestorative Cases: Process and Delivery \nThe restorative sessions were usually facilitated by a trained police officer. While the \nmajority of the restorative cautions took place in a police station, most of the \nconferences (primarily in Ballymena) took place elsewhere.10 Levels of victim \nparticipation were low. The actual victim attended only 20% of the conferences and in \nthe Ballymena area (where most conferences took place), they invariably used a \nsurrogate victim. The young person and their parent(s) usually attended, and \noccasionally a social worker or a teacher was also in attendance. The majority (over \n90%) of the restorative sessions resulted in a written or verbal apology to the victim \nand in only 8% of the cases did the young person refuse to apologise. Few of the \nsessions resulted in any compensation or reparation, though the majority of cases in \nboth locations involved retail theft, where goods were normally recovered \nimmediately. \n \nThe restorative sessions were found to be resource-intensive. Though the restorative \ncautions generally took about a quarter of an hour to administer and the conferences \nusually lasted between half an hour to an hour, they took considerable time to set up \nand arrange. The research team concluded that a relatively conservative estimate of \nthe time commitment for the police was on average about 4 hours for a restorative \ncaution and about 4\u00bd to 5 hours for a conference.  \n \nThese findings raise important issues that have implications with regard to \u2018best \npractice\u2019. They show a number of particularly poignant problems including: the lack \nof meaningful involvement of the victim; the choice of a \u2018neutral\u2019 venue; possible \n\u2018net-widening\u2019, that is drawing petty, first time offenders into the criminal justice \nsystem; and the use of a very resource intensive process to deal with relatively low \nlevel offending. Before exploring these issues it is worth looking beyond the files to \nhow the restorative sessions were handled in practice and what participants thought of \nthe process. \n \n                                                 \n10 Usually at a private room in a local shopping centre. \n 9\n2. Observational Research \nThe researchers observed 29 restorative sessions, 10 of which were restorative \ncautions and 19 were restorative conferences. What follows is a description of how \nthe restorative work was carried out in practice and the reactions and interplay \nbetween the participants.  \n \nRestorative Cautions \nAll of the restorative cautions that were observed were held in a police station. The \noffences varied considerably, and included five cases of criminal damage, motoring \noffences, arson and theft. The offences had taken place from one month to nine \nmonths prior to the caution. Most of the cautions took between 10 and 15 minutes to \nadminister. The police officers wore plain clothes and were friendly, informal and \nwell prepared. The facilities were comfortable and proceedings ran on time. The \nofficers made clear opening statements, introducing everyone and explaining that they \nwere not there to judge whether the young person was \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019 and respect was \nshown for all parties involved. The officers did not always clarify the voluntary nature \nof the process, however, and its legal implications. At the end of the process several \nparents and young people were still unclear about whether they would have to go to \ncourt and whether they would have a criminal record. \n  \nAfter introducing everyone the police officer would invite the young person to say in \ntheir own words what they had done. This was usually followed up by a question \nabout what the young person was thinking when they committed the offence. The \nfacilitator would then inquire about the actual and potential consequences of the act. \nIn some cases the young person said very little and in such cases the facilitator \nsometimes seemed at a loss as to how to enable the young person to take \nresponsibility for their behaviour and to acknowledge the harm it had caused, \nparticularly to the victim. The effect on the victim (not present) and the young \nperson\u2019s family would then be probed. In one case of stone throwing, the victim was \nactually an off-duty police officer. While in this case it did not seem to damage the \nprocess, the representation of the victim\u2019s views by the facilitator would risk placing \nin jeopardy the perceived neutrality of the process, given that the facilitator was \nhimself a police officer. \n \n 10\nFacilitators often found it difficult to engage the young person in the process. \nDialogue worked best where officers moved proceedings along at a relatively easy \npace and tried to maintain a natural conversational style. Some officers had the \n\u201cscript\u201d with them but left it on their lap only to be used if they got stuck. This \nenabled a more personal style to emerge and this generally encouraged the young \nperson to speak up more. Some officers did not feel comfortable with some of the \nlanguage in the script and changed it to suit the language, maturity and culture of the \nyoung people. One officer had created a shortened script that only included the key \nquestions and issues, which seemed a positive compromise between following the \nscript rigidly and developing one\u2019s own personal style. On occasions however, the \nreluctance of juveniles to communicate seemed to exacerbate officers\u2019 own anxiety \nand lack of experience, which only contributed to making the atmosphere even more \nuncomfortable. For example, some officers tended to go through the process too \nquickly, often filling silences or prompting the young person with appropriate \nresponses, and sometimes providing the young person with virtually all the answers. \nFurthermore, once the officers lost confidence they tended to lead rather than \nfacilitate, thus effectively ceasing to be neutral facilitators.  \n \nSince the restorative cautions that were observed did not involve a victim (even in a \nsurrogate capacity), the facilitator would often try to inject a \u2018victim perspective\u2019 into \nproceedings, through perhaps reading a letter or recounting a conversation with the \nvictim. This approach had an impact in that the young person and parent had to \nrespond to another perspective. However, since the victim\u2019s view was not informed \nby an encounter with the offender, the value of this process was obviously limited by \nlack of interaction and exchange.  \n \nThe restorative cautioning agreements that were observed included: \n \n\u2022 Simple cautions, such as in road traffic cases in which there was no actual \nvictim \n\u2022 Expressions of remorse without any gesture towards the victim \n\u2022 Agreements to pay for damage; sometimes coupled with written or verbal \napologies \n 11\n\u2022 Agreements such as: to avoid certain people who use drugs; to clean the \nhouse; or to make up for the distress caused to the offender\u2019s parents. \n \nThe formalities of the cautioning process were conducted with clarity, brevity and \nrespect. After the relevant forms were completed, the facilitator summed up usually \nalong the lines of how the young person had made a bad choice, but now, through \nagreeing to apologise, had made a good choice. This is regarded as an important \nelement of the re-integration process (Braithwaite, 1989; Umbreit, 2000), although at \ntimes it did appear to get lost in the confusion of filling in forms.  \n \nRestorative Conferences \nThe seventeen restorative conferences that we observed were all held in Ballymena. \nThe offences were all theft (shoplifting) except for one of criminal damage. Most of \nthe conferences lasted between 35 and 45 minutes.  \n \nIn contrast to Mountpottinger, the conferences usually took place in a private room at \nthe local shopping centre. This helped to emphasise the victims\u2019 stake in the process \nand avoided the stigma of them having to enter a police station. Only two cases in \nBallymena were not held at the shopping centre,11 but the organisation of these \nparticular sessions gave rise to a number of serious concerns.  \n \nThe facilitator was about ten minutes late for both the sessions, which led to some \nconfusion. At the police station, the surrogate victim and the young person and his \nfather had to wait in the same room for the facilitator to arrive. In one case, the parties \ndid their best to have a friendly chat while waiting, but in the other the atmosphere \nwas somewhat tense. Obviously this situation could have become even more difficult \nif the \u201creal victim\u201d had been present.  \n \nAs with the restorative cautions in Mountpottinger, the young people in the \nconferences held at Ballymena were also generally reluctant to communicate. In some \ncases the facilitator or parent had to prompt the young person to respond to the \n                                                 \n11 One of these conferences was held in a police station, and the other at the local office of a \ncommunity organisation. \n 12\nquestions, and would often suggest answers in the process. On a few occasions, this \nwas done even before the young person had the opportunity to speak.  \n \nIn another case a 15 year old girl spent most of the conference crying. This meant that \nit was difficult to see whether she was taking any responsibility for her actions and \ntheir consequences. Significantly, when the facilitator and mother suggested that she \nshould go to the shop and apologise, she became animated and said that she would not \ndo that because the shopkeeper was \u201cignorant\u201d. She then lapsed back into silence only \nto communicate as the apology was being negotiated, but without entering into any \nfurther dialogue. This suggests that young people\u2019s silence may not just be due to \nimmaturity, shame or shyness but may sometimes be used as a tactic when feeling \nthreatened by a process led by adults. \n \nThe presence of a surrogate victim at the Ballymena conferences appeared to have \nmore impact on the offender and family than a letter or a report from the facilitator of \nthe victim\u2019s experience (as used at Mountpottinger). The surrogate tended to describe \nthe typical effects of theft for a retailer. Although this did enable the young person to \nappreciate the consequences of their behaviour, it nevertheless lacked emotional \nimpact. Some retailers merely made their views known while others attempted to \nengage in a dialogue. This seemed to arouse more interest in the young person and \npresumably had a greater impact, although in two cases the victim representative \ntended to dominate the process.  \n \nMost conferences ended in an agreement to apologise to the victim either through a \nletter or face to face. Occasionally it seemed that the facilitator was only aiming for an \napology, which meant that the offender was not asked to consider any other way of \nmaking amends. This may have been because of low expectations of the young \nperson\u2019s motivation, or because the young people were generally petty offenders and \nan apology was considered sufficient. Once an agreement had been made the \nfacilitator asked the young person and parent to sign the relevant forms. These needed \nto be explained and this was generally accomplished effectively.  \n \n \n \n 13\n3. Interviews with participants \nDuring the period of the fieldwork, the team conducted separate face-to-face \ninterviews with the participants immediately after the 29 sessions which were \nobserved. In addition, we also interviewed thirty families over the telephone who had \nparticipated in restorative sessions prior to the beginning of the fieldwork.12 \n  \nAttitudes of the Parents \nAlmost all of the parents felt they had been kept informed about the arrangements of \nthe conference, and around half praised the police for their flexibility in relation to \norganisation, and the timing of the conference. Satisfaction with the police was \ngenerally high. The parents were positive in relation to the way in which facilitators \nhandled their role at the conference, over 90% of respondents using positive phrases \nsuch as \u201chelpful\u201d, \u201csupportive\u201d, \u201cunderstanding\u201d, \u201cfair\u201d and \u201csympathetic\u201d.  \n \nMost parents described the conference as \u201cinformal\u201d, \u201crelaxed\u201d or \u201cfriendly\u201d: three \nquarters of interviewees described this as the \u201cbest part\u201d of the process, although most \nof those who were interviewed in person immediately after the sessions just seemed \nrelieved that it was over. Only three respondents described it negatively \u2013 one saying \nthat he felt \u201ctense and uneasy, and just wanted to get it over with\u201d. Just under half said \nthat they had felt tense and nervous to begin with, but that the facilitator had made an \neffort to make everyone feel at ease. Just over half of the parents identified the \nreintegrative shaming aspect of the process as its best feature (Braithwaite 1989). One \nparent stated in relation to her daughter that it had \u201cshamed her into admitting that \nshe\u2019d done wrong\u201d. Notably, none of the respondents felt that their son or daughter \nwas stigmatised as a \u201cbad\u201d person, although there were mixed impressions as to \nwhether the process was worthwhile. Two parents mentioned that they felt that the \nlevel of shame experienced during the conference was unjustified, but another parent \ninterviewed in person said that he felt an \u201cold fashioned telling off\u201d would have been \nbetter. Indeed, in more than one case the parents actually expressed a preference for \nthe imposition of more punitive measures. \n \n                                                 \n12 Unfortunately only four juveniles were willing to speak on the telephone, and they were generally \nunresponsive, especially to some of the open-ended questions. \n 14\nThe team asked the telephone interviewees about the effect of the conference on the \nyoung person. About two-thirds of the parents agreed that the session helped the \noffender to understand the impact of the offence upon the victim. A clear majority \nwere particularly impressed by the degree of regret shown by their son \/ daughter after \nthe conference. One parent said: \n \n\u201c[My son] was really reflective afterwards and I think he felt really ashamed \nof himself for a while. From a parent\u2019s point of view, it was a bit \nuncomfortable to know that he was feeling bad, but from the conference, I \nknew that this was part of the process and was very necessary\u201d \n \nNonetheless, it was evident that while parents were, on the whole, supportive of the \ninitiative, many also had reservations. One criticism of the Mountpottinger cases was \nthat conferences were held at a neighbouring police station, Willowfield. While most \nrespondents felt happy enough about this venue, three people from Belfast mentioned \nthat they were unhappy with the stigma of going to a police station, and four \nrespondents expressed relief that their conferences were held in a neutral venue.  \n \nOne of the most important concerns of three parents, all from the Ballymena sub-\ndivision, was that their children had been unfairly dragged into the criminal justice \nsystem for committing very petty offences. One concerned father complained: \n  \n\u201c[T]he theft was  relatively minor as far as the value of the goods was \nconcerned. He was very humiliated when he was brought in and fingerprinted \nand when they took a DNA sample and stuff\u2026\u201d \n \nThe mother of one girl, who was apprehended for shoplifting, commented: \n \n\u201cI think overall she was treated fairly, but I was just a bit surprised they told \nme she would have to go through all this for lifting sweets.\u201d \n \nAnother notable reservation raised by three interviewees was the fear that the \nsympathetic attitudes displayed by the facilitator in the conference would not be \nmatched by police attitudes on the ground. One parent felt that the police were out to \n 15\n\u201cbully children and will lift them for anything\u201d and one said \u201cthey\u2019re out to get \neveryone on our estate, no matter what age they are.\u201d One juvenile\u2019s father expressly \nmentioned the fact that police harassment of young people could \u201c...undermine the \ngood work he [the facilitator] did in the conference.\u201d \n \nAttitudes of Offenders \nThe four offenders to whom we spoke on the telephone were reluctant to respond \nsubstantially to open-ended questions. All agreed that the process has been handled \nfairly and most spoke highly of the facilitator. They all agreed that the conference had \nhelped them to understand the impact of their actions, and two said it would make \nthem less likely to get into trouble again. The juveniles we interviewed in person were \nslightly more forthcoming. Most were positive about the way the conference had been \nhandled and felt they had been treated fairly, and were adamant that they would not \nre-offend. \n \nAttitudes of Victims \nThe surrogate victims who attended conferences expressed a high degree of \nsatisfaction and seemed to appreciate the remorse shown. However, the one \u2018true\u2019 \nvictim who was interviewed was very dissatisfied with the conference, as the \nindividual offender was not prepared to apologise or admit responsibility. This \nillustrates the importance of the facilitator making a home visit prior to the \nconference, in order to assess the young person\u2019s level of remorse and whether he or \nshe demonstrates a willingness to apologise. There is a clear onus on the facilitator to \nensure that the victim is given a clear understanding of the risks as well as the \npotential benefits in attending a conference (Hoyle 2002). As this one case has shown, \na conference with an offender who is not prepared to admit liability can result in a \nform of secondary victimisation. \n \nPolice Officers \nThe police officers we interviewed who facilitated the process were convinced of its \nvalue in comparison with the former cautioning practice, expressing a belief that it \navoids the tendency to write young people off. They believed it was a fairer and more \nhuman and emotional process. The officers felt they had received adequate training \nand that the programme was being properly supported and resourced. There was no \n 16\nevidence that the legitimacy deficit traditionally suffered by the police in certain areas \nof Northern Ireland had hindered their work. Indeed, there was a strong belief among \nofficers that the schemes had the potential to assist community policing and build \nbetter relationships with families living in socially deprived areas. \n \n \nDiscussion \nIt is often argued that, to avoid being marginalised, restorative justice practices must \nbe placed firmly within the formal criminal justice system (Shapland 2003, Dignan \n2003). It was clear that this was the case in the pilots as the police retained close \ncontrol over the management of the schemes and were keen to see them develop \nsuccessfully. All stakeholders valued the philosophy behind the schemes and thought \nhighly of the way they had been managed. There were, nonetheless, a number of \nmajor concerns arising from the research. It was found that, on a number of fronts, the \npractices of the police service did not reflect internationally accepted standards of best \npractice.13 These standards reach beyond superficial perceptions and act as \nbenchmarks against which schemes can be evaluated. If the rights and interests of all \nparties involved in the process are to be respected, and if broken relationships are to \nbe mended, those responsible for managing and implementing restorative programmes \nare under an onus to take active steps to ensure that principles of best practice are \nalways observed. \n \nThere were two major areas which gave the research team cause for concern. These \nwere the apparently high risk of net-widening and the lack of real victim participation \nin the schemes. A number of other issues were also identified as falling short of best \npractice. While these are perhaps less serious, action is nonetheless needed if the \nNorthern Ireland system is to operate effectively and take advantage of the potential \nof restorative practices. \n \n1. Net-Widening \nThere has always been a danger that when informal alternatives are introduced into \nthe criminal justice system they may serve to supplement rather than substitute for \n                                                 \n13 See generally Umbreit 2000, Marshall 1999, Braithwaite 1994 and Dignan 1992. \n 17\nexisting procedures (Davis et al., 1989; Dignan, 1992; O\u2019Mahony and Deazley 2000). \nSince one of the aims behind most restorative programmes is to divert young people \nfrom court, prosecution, and the criminal process generally, it is crucial that new \nrestorative schemes do not extend beyond the bounds of the previous system by \ndrawing new cases into the system. \n \nOne of the greatest concerns arising from the pilots was that they appeared to draw in \nsome very young and petty offenders who consequently experienced a very \ndemanding process of accountability that, in our opinion, was disproportionate to the \nharm caused. Some 80% of cases that we examined were for offences concerning \nproperty worth less than \u00a315. It was not uncommon to come across cases where a \nconsiderable amount of police time had been invested in arranging a full conference \nfor the theft of a chocolate bar or a can of soft drink. \n \nThese findings all pertain to the question of whether it is appropriate to use restorative \nconferences, which are obviously costly and time-consuming, for mainly first-time \noffenders involved in very petty offences. It could be argued that a better course of \naction might be to deal with such cases by way of \u2018advice and warning\u2019, particularly \nwhere the value of goods involved is under \u00a315-\u00a320; the young person has had no \nprevious contact with the police; and he or she shows remorse. \n \nWhile the use of restorative conferences for such minor incidents may have a \nbeneficial effect, in that it may help a young person realise the harm they cause and \nthe impact on victims, such decisions place the young person higher up the criminal \njustice tariff. This is because they result in a formal caution, which is a police record \nthat can be cited in court as part of a criminal record.14 This thereby raises the \nprospect of prosecution, should the juvenile come to the attention of the police in the \nfuture. As such, there is a real risk that these practices may lead to net-widening by \ndrawing less serious offenders further into the criminal justice system.  \n \n                                                 \n14 Whilst not strictly a \u2018criminal record\u2019 under the Rehabilitation of Offenders (NI) Order 1978, such \npolice cautions can, and often are, cited in court as part of an individual\u2019s criminal record. Previous \n 18\nIt is possible that this could merely be a teething problem with these schemes. The \npolice may have been overly enthusiastic to appear successful in implementing the \nnew scheme widely across the board. There was, however, an assumption among \nstakeholders that a conference is less punitive than a prosecution and thus should \ngenerally be reserved for first or second time offenders. As the scheme develops and \nofficers become more familiar with principles of good practice, the danger of net-\nwidening may well address itself over time through effective gate-keeping.  \n \nConsidering that the restorative sessions were very labour intensive, it might be better \nif they were targeted towards more \u2018at risk\u2019 and \u2018in need\u2019 offenders. Indeed, Maxwell \nand Morris (2001) has argued that because effective restorative work is so resource \nintensive, it should be directed towards more serious offenders and not at first time \noffenders who have committed minor offences. Such a change would result in a full \nrestorative conference being put on a more equal footing with a prosecution, rather \nthan being seen as the equivalent of (at most) a caution.15 In this way the restorative \njustice philosophy would be seen as a real alternative to prosecution, rather than as a \nless serious response to offending. There are strong arguments in favour of making \nthe restorative process at least as taxing as whatever sentence a court would impose, \nparticularly on a first conviction, but it should never be more onerous in terms of what \nis demanded from the offender (Braithwaite, 1994; Davis et al, 1989; Dignan, 1992). \n \n2. Victim Participation \n \nThe low level of victim participation highlighted by our findings suggests a greater \neffort needs to be made to encourage victim participation. Though the lack of direct \nvictim participation in the schemes was disappointing, it perhaps was unsurprising \ngiven that other evaluations of similar schemes in the UK have produced similar \nfindings. Crawford and Newburn (2003) noted that victims attended youth offender \npanel meetings in only 13% of cases. Similarly Hoyle et al. (2002) found that just \n                                                                                                                                            \ncautions are also taken into account by the police when deciding how to respond to any subsequent \noffending. \n15 Some police officers suggested that Magistrates should be given the power and encouraged to \nadjourn more serious cases for restorative conferences, thus avoiding convictions even when the police \nfelt a prosecution was necessary. \n 19\n16% participated in their evaluation of the Thames Valley scheme. In contrast, \nextremely high rates of victim participation have been reported from some Australian \nprojects, notably the Canberra RISE experiment, and also the Wagga Wagga \nconferencing evaluation where recorded rates of victim participation were as high as \n90 per cent  (Moore and O\u2019Connell, 1994). \n \nIt is difficult to pinpoint the precise reasons for this difference, although the fact that \nthe UK schemes are comparatively new may indicate that they are still experiencing \nteething problems. Non-participation is unlikely to be attributable to the lack of effort \non the part of the Juvenile Liaison Officers in Northern Ireland, who seemed \nextremely enthusiastic about the schemes. Hill (2002) has suggested that while any \nsort of coercion to attend would obviously be undesirable, there was a risk in Thames \nValley that the police had become so over-sensitised to the need not to apply pressure, \nthat they did not take the opportunity to explain fully the potential benefits of the \nprocess to victims. Similarly, Hoyle (2002) noted that many of the Thames Valley \nfacilitators gave victims a misleading idea of restorative justice: for example, in many \ncases victims were not told that they could bring along a supporter. As such, victims \nmay have been inadvertently dissuaded from attending. It is not possible to gauge \nwhether this may also have been the case in these two projects since interviews were \nnot conducted with non-participating victims.  It should be stressed, however, that \ngiven the fact that non-participation is a major problem for more police-led schemes, \nit is probable that there are deeper issues at play, including a lack of understanding of \nthe nature of restorative processes (Hill 2002; Daly 2003);  fear of retaliation (Hoyle \net al, 2002; Crawford and Newburn 2003); and\/or simply not being able to attend \n(Hoyle et al, 2002).  \n \nGiven that the UK schemes are still in comparative infancy in comparison to their \nAustralasian counterparts, it could be that increased rates of victim participation will \nfollow if current practices are fine-tuned and further developed. For example, greater \nemphasis could be placed on taking time to explain the various options to the victim, \nthe different processes, their advantages and disadvantages as well as developing their \ncapacity to participate. Capacity building may include transport and child-care \narrangements, as well as arranging suitable dates, times and venues for conferences. \nAnother clear issue of concern to many of the parents we interviewed was their \n 20\nunhappiness about police stations being used as venues for the conferences. As a basic \npoint of good practice, the venue should be a neutral, comfortable setting for all \nparties involved. Obviously the use of the police station as a venue could make both \nvictims and offenders feel uncomfortable, particularly if they have had previous \ninvolvement with the police (Zehr, 1990). This also raises questions as to whether \nvictims should be better prepared for the conferences so that they have a good idea of \nwhat to expect. There might be, for example, a further role for volunteers from Victim \nSupport in effecting this end. \n \nIf implemented, such measures could undoubtedly go some way to addressing the \nproblems which may discourage both victims and offenders from participating in \nconferences. While it would be entirely contrary to good practice to suggest that any \nsort of pressure be applied to either victims or offenders (Hill 2002), taking active \nsteps designed to encourage and facilitate participation would add a great deal to the \nprovisions already in place.  \n \nAnother interesting issue in relation to victim participation was the use of surrogate \nvictims. In Ballymena the practice of using surrogate victims was developed from an \nearlier retail theft initiative which used a panel of volunteer shopkeepers to impress \nupon young shoplifters the impact of their actions on local businesses, the livelihoods \nof shopkeepers and their staff. The panel was incorporated into the new restorative \nconferencing scheme, and panel members were used to represent the views of the \nvictim, if the actual shopkeeper declined to participate. Since the vast majority of \ncases that were dealt with by conferencing in Ballymena involved shoplifting, the \nscheme appeared to work well. It addressed a problem whereby it was difficult to get \nshopkeepers to attend conferences, especially when the value of the goods was \ngenerally low and these had usually been recovered immediately when the young \nperson was apprehended. So the surrogate victims offered the advantage of at least \nbeing able to get someone from a victims perspective to participate in the conference.  \n \nIt was clear there were a number of advantages of involving surrogate victims in the \nconference process. The surrogates brought in a strong victim\u2019s perspective into the \nprocess and appeared to have had more of an impact on the young people than the \nfacilitator simply reading a letter from a victim or recounting something the victim \n 21\nhad said about the offence. But using surrogate victims also had a number of distinct \ndisadvantages, especially over using the real victim. For instance, it was probable that \nthe impact of the restorative process on the offender was diminished by them not \nbeing confronted and having to explain their actions to the real victim at the \nconference. Using a surrogate also obviously detracted from the restorative goals of \nconferencing, where there should be a process of empowerment, dialogue, negotiation \nand agreement between all the parties. And from the victim\u2019s perspective there were \nobvious disadvantages as the victim does not get the opportunity to confront the \noffender, to have the offender explain their actions, and importantly to understand \ncircumstances and reasons behind the offence (as well as negotiate compensation or \nrestitution) - all of which are central to the conferencing process. Furthermore, there \nmay be a danger of routinely using surrogates when they are easily available, rather \nthan embarking on the difficult process of trying to get the real victims involved in the \nprocess. Though we found no evidence of this practice in the pilots, this would \nobviously be counterproductive towards achieving the restorative goals of \nconferencing. However, having said this, given the reality of low levels of victim \nparticipation in many police led conferencing schemes, surrogates offer another useful \nway of injecting the victim\u2019s perspective into conferencing proceedings and other \nprogrammes may wish to consider this approach in suitable situations. \n \nMore fundamental questions arise, as it is questionable whether a justice system in \nwhich victims rarely participate can be said to be truly \u2018restorative\u2019 (Daly 2003). \nSchemes can still be \u2018restorative\u2019 without the participation of the victim, although \nmost commentators are in agreement that best outcomes are achieved when victims \nand offenders are brought together in a face-to-face meeting (Hoyle, 2002). In theory, \nvictims should be able to \u2018enjoy the benefits of the restorative process even if they \nchoose not to attend a meeting with the offender\u2019 (Hoyle, 2002 p102). However, as in \nHoyle et al\u2019s evaluation of the Thames Valley scheme, there were very few occasions \nwhere an immediate, direct apology could be given and accepted. Financial restitution \nwas very rare, and it is not clear how often offenders followed through with their \npromises to apologise to the victim. It is therefore doubtful whether the pilots can be \ndescribed as de facto \u2018restorative\u2019, both in terms of process and outcome. However, as \nRoach (2000) argues, popular ideas in criminal justice will, by definition, mean \ndifferent things to different people. Therefore labelling a scheme as \u2018restorative\u2019 or \n 22\n\u2018unrestorative\u2019 is perhaps unhelpful, given the policy objective behind the pilots was \nto deliver cautions using a restorative \u2018framework\u2019. \n \n3. Other Concerns \nOther important aspects of these pilots also fell short of good practice. These included \nthe lack of a holistic approach, problems regarding effective facilitation, and the \nabsence of any follow-up process or monitoring of the agreements. \n \nThe Lack of a Holistic Approach \nAn effective working partnership is also required to realise the full potential of \nrestorative solutions. There are limits on the ability of the police to organise and \nfacilitate conferences without effective links with the statutory, voluntary and private \nsectors. Without such partnerships, there is little chance of a holistic picture being \ndrawn up of the offender and his background circumstances, and underlying reasons \nas to why he may have committed the offence may remain hidden. The uncovering of \nsuch information can be effective in producing increasingly satisfying results at \nconference stage (Umbreit, 2000), although effective partnership is largely dependent \nupon skilled management, commitment and the investment of resources (Marshall, \n1999). As far as possible, other statutory and community bodies should be involved in \nthe process. (Pavlich 2001, Van Ness 2003).  \n \nUnfortunately, in the two pilot areas there were very few outside the police who were \ntrained as facilitators: during the course of our observations we observed only one \nsuch case. There is nothing to suggest that the police discouraged outsiders to \ncontribute, but the problem would instead seem to stem from the reluctance of other \nagencies to provide facilitators due to staffing or resourcing issues.16 Undoubtedly \nincreased participation by other agencies and community workers should nevertheless \nbe encouraged, as it could enhance the reintegrative potential of the process. \n \n                                                 \n16 Representatives of agencies we spoke to, such as Social Services, were very supportive of the \napproach but were over-committed with other work.  \n 23\nProblems regarding Effective Facilitation \nIt is worth noting that the suitability of a police officer to effectively undertake the \nrole of a conference facilitator has been questioned by a number of commentators \n(Braithwaite 1994; Umbreit and Zehr, 1996; Dignan, 1999). Concerns have included \nsuggestions that the police may be more prone to coercion and less sensitive to the \nneeds of the parties than lay persons; that young offenders may be intimidated in front \nof police-officers; and that there remains a risk of authoritarian behaviour. However, \nempirical evidence discussed by McCold (1998) refutes many of these concerns, and \nhe also outlines a number of potential advantages to police-based models. These \ninclude the arguments that conferencing led by the police is perceived as being more \n\u201cserious\u201d and part of the mainstream criminal process; that the police are more likely \nto be successful in ensuring that undertakings are carried out; that victims feel safer \nwith the police as facilitators; and that many of the skills required for facilitation are \nalready developed in many officers who are involved in community policing. \nBraithwaite (1994) seems to share this view and argues that police can be trained to \nbe \u201ccompetent, empowering, facilitators.\u201d Indeed, data from previous evaluations \nwould seem to suggest that both victims and offenders trust police to organise a fair \nand non-authoritarian conference (McCold and Wachtel 1998, Hoyle et al 2002), and \nwith a lack of empirical evidence to the contrary, it would appear that police-\nfacilitation is consistent with restorative justice principles. \n \nOur research found that each of the facilitators in the pilot areas seemed to be \nenthusiastic and sincerely committed to the restorative process. They had been well \ntrained in the use of the script. In most cases they created safe and comfortable \nsettings and atmospheres, sometimes in spite of the facilities. From time to time \nhowever, poor practice did seem to creep in: for example, there was generally too \nmuch use of suggestion, and most facilitators encountered difficulties in engaging the \nyoung person in the dialogue. \n \nOne of the main problems in relation to the facilitation was the apparent reluctance of \nmany facilitators to encourage reparation. In one case, the juvenile\u2019s offer to \ncompensate the victim was actually turned down. In cases where the young person is \nstruggling or is reluctant to offer a means of repairing the harm, consideration should \nbe given to allowing private planning time for the family and young person to draw \n 24\nup an action plan. This would reduce the anxiety and tension among all the parties, \nwhich may be inhibiting creative problem solving. This action plan may include a \nrequest for services for both the young person and the family.  \n \nThe Absence of Follow-up \nA follow-up process is essential to encourage all parties to keep agreements which are \nnot enforceable at law and to keep everyone informed (Claassen 1996, Umbreit 2000). \nCrawford and Newburn (2003) and Hoyle et al (2002) also noted that follow-up was \ndeficient in terms of the quality of feedback delivered to victims. The facilitator \nshould obtain regular updates from the offender, keep the victim informed and \nschedule additional sessions if required.17 The conference agreements observed were \nadequately geared towards problem-solving, and sought to provide a pathway for the \noffender to reintegrate into the community. However, it was regrettable that in many \nof the cases in this study, follow-up work was not undertaken to ensure that \nundertakings given by the young person in the agreement were being met. Indeed, \nseven of the parents whom we interviewed cited this as the worst aspect of the \nprocess. Whilst infractions in individual cases may appear to be minor, a failure to \naddress these would undoubtedly set a poor precedent and could potentially lead to \nfuture problems in receiving co-operation from individuals and local businesses. A \nsystem of monitoring should be put in place that assesses satisfaction with the process \nfollowing all restorative sessions, and post-session monitoring needs to be completed \nto see whether agreements have been carried out to the satisfaction of all parties.18  \n \n                                                 \n17 For example, Umbreit (2000) points out that brief phone calls can reinforce the facilitator\u2019s role as a \ncontinuing source of information and referral for a period of up to six months after the conference. \n18 Even if this monitoring process is not enforceable. \n 25\n  \nConclusions \nThis study of two restorative justice pilot projects provides a useful insight into the \npractical, procedural and operational aspects of delivering a police-led restorative \ncautioning process for juveniles. The schemes were successful to some extent in \nsecuring the traditional aims of restorative programmes in that reintegration was \nachieved through avoidance of prosecution and through a process which emphasised \nthat the young person was not \u2018bad\u2019. It highlighted the impact of their offending on \nthe victim and may even have helped foster better police community relations. In \nthese respects the pilot projects represented a substantive improvement in quality on \nprevious cautioning practice.  \n \nHowever, as noted in the discussion above there were drawbacks, not least of which \nwas the fact that the process led to a degree of net-widening. This was evidenced by \nthe fact that some of the people dealt with under the scheme were very young, had no \nprevious police contact, committed trivial offences and previously would have been \ndealt with through informal means (such as \u2018No Further Police Action\u2019 or informal \n\u2018Advice and Warning\u2019). There also appeared to be a tendency to include some \noffenders because it was seen as new, effective and a \u2018good thing\u2019 - something young \npeople could learn from. Though intentions may have been admirable, the restorative \nsessions were part of the cautioning scheme, which meant that these young people \nended up with a formal caution at the end of the process. Since cautions are recorded \nby the police and cited in court, they could have negative impacts in any subsequent \nproceedings. The restorative sessions were also shown to be very resource \ndemanding. They took a lot of time and effort to organise and run, in order to be done \nproperly. Despite this there was relatively little actual victim participation. This \nobviously limited their restorative potential in terms of reparation, reconciliation and \ngetting young people to understand the real impact of their actions on their victims, or \nfor victims to benefit by being involved in the process.  \n \nEven in spite of the low level of victim participation, however, the schemes have the \npotential to contribute to the spirit of transition in a \u2018post-conflict\u2019 society such as \n 26\nNorthern Ireland. McEvoy and Mika (2002) have illustrated the significant potential \nthat community-led schemes hold in this regard. In Northern Ireland where criminal \njustice processes and institutions have suffered traditionally from a legitimacy \ndeficit,19 restorative practices hold tremendous potential to introduce new values into \nthe criminal justice system (Dignan and Lowey 2000). Indeed, they also hold the \npotential to transform not only criminal justice systems, but also legal systems and \neven culture and politics (Bayley 2001, Braithwaite 2002). It could be said that \npolice-led restorative justice could also aid the transitional process in Northern Ireland \nby helping foster improvements in strained police \/ community relations in many \nareas, even since the end of the conflict. Pollard (2001) has suggested that a shift has \nalready taken place in policing in the Thamas Valley towards a more problem-\norientated, community-based paradigm. It was clear from the interviews we \nconducted that the parents of the young people involved placed a high degree of trust \nin juvenile liaison officers and there was no evidence that either the parents or the \nyoung people felt that they were being \u2018picked on\u2019 because of their religious beliefs or \npolitical opinions. If the police are perceived as upholding restorative values, this may \nwell help strengthen police \/ community relations which in turn may contribute to the \nbroader social transitional process as we move towards a truly \u2018post conflict\u2019 society. \n \nSince our evaluation the police have changed and improved their practice and \nformalised their cautioning policy so that all juvenile cautions in Northern Ireland are \nnow delivered using a restorative framework. The Government is also greatly \nextending the use of restorative practices for juveniles throughout the criminal justice \nsystem in Northern Ireland under the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002, which came \ninto effect in the Winter of 2003. In Part 4 of the legislation, sections 53 to 57 allow \nfor \u201cyouth conferencing\u201d \u2013 which can either be of a diversionary nature, in which case \nthe Director of Public Prosecutions will decide whether or not to refer the juvenile to \nyouth conferencing, or they can be ordered by a court as a means of disposal subject \nto the conditions laid down in section 56 of the Act. Such changes will have profound \nimplications for the operation of youth justice in Northern Ireland, as the vast majority \n                                                 \n19 O\u2019Mahony et al 2000 note from their findings of Northern Ireland Communities Crime Survey, that \ncriminal justice agencies such as the police have experienced a significant legitimacy deficit especially \nin communities which are either strongly republican or loyalist.   \n 27\nof juvenile criminal cases brought for prosecution will now be dealt with through \nconferences.  \n \nA \u201cconference plan\u201d will seek to facilitate reparation to the victim, as well as \nproviding a process by which reintegration of the young person back into society can \noccur.  While such plans are subject to the agreement of all parties involved, and \nthereafter to the approval of the DPP, the Northern Ireland Human Rights \nCommission has recently expressed some concerns. These have included the \npossibility of the proportionality of conference plans being undermined, in that there \nis no linkage between the diversionary plan and the severity of the offence, and that \nsome children may run the risk of being pressurised into agreeing to overly \nburdensome reparative tasks. Furthermore, the Human Rights Commission have \nexpressed concerns that conference plans are not subject to any independent \nscrutiny.20  \n \nIt is a matter of some concern that these types of issues have not been fully addressed \nin the legislation and this remains an issue that the Government may have to return to \nin future years. As such, it has become even more important that principles of best \npractice are given due regard by the criminal justice agencies when formulating \ninternal protocols, policies and practices surrounding the use of youth conferences.  \n \nOur research has shown that if conferences are to be effective they will need to be \nmindful of avoiding net-widening, so that less serious offenders are not needlessly \ndrawn into the criminal justice system simply because it is seen as a \u2018better\u2019 approach. \nThey will need to ensure that requirements imposed on young people are not \ndisproportionate to the seriousness of their offence. Youth conferences will require \nsignificant resources, as this study has shown that facilitation takes considerable time \nand effort to arrange and run. If they are to be effective the organisers will have to \ninvest considerable effort in ensuring that victims actually participate in the process. \nThe process should allow for meaningful victim \/offender dialogue and reparation to \n                                                 \n20 Submission by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission to members of the House of \nCommons, 27th February 2002, available on-line at \nhttp:\/\/www.nihrc.org\/files\/justice_ni_bill_27_feb_2002.htm \n 28\noccur if they are to achieve their restorative potential. Therefore, while it may be \nappealing to expand the use of restorative cautioning in principle, given the heavy \nresource demands of doing it properly, the obvious limited financial resources \navailable and the dangers of net-widening, \u2018more\u2019 in this context does not necessarily \nmean better. Rather, we would suggest, based on the findings of this research, that it \nmay be advisable to concentrate on delivering a higher quality restorative process \nwith fewer, more serious cases.     \n \n \nREFERENCES \n \nBAYLEY, D (2001), \u201cSecurity and Justice for All\u201d in H Strang and J Braithwaite \n(eds), Restorative Justice and Civil Society.
