Introduction\nSalmonella serotypes are among the most common bacteria responsible for foodborne \ngastroenteritis and can be classified as a potential microorganism for bioterrorism (Khan \net al., 2001). Approximately 76 million food-borne illnesses resulting in 5000 deaths \nhave been reported in the United States alone (Mead et al., 1999). The World Health \nOrganization (WHO) reported that salmonellosis caused by Salmonella sp. is the most \nfrequently reported food-borne disease worldwide (Schlundt, 2002). Therefore, the ability \nto rapidly detect and identify this pathogen is extremely important to maintain public \nhealth safety and security. The two most commonly found types of Salmonella are \nSalmonella typhimurium and Salmonella enteritidis (Schlundt, 2002). As well as the \nproblem of food-borne illness, losses due to microbial spoilage and contamination in \nfoods usually have a significant economical impact on the country producing it. At \npresent many of the currently used methods of Salmonella detection are time consuming\nand labor intensive. In order to avoid the sale of contaminated products, expensive \ninventories are held at the production site while samples are tested for microbial \ncontamination, which often takes more than 3 days. Since food products have short shelf \nlife, they are released before microbial results are available. Rapid detection of pathogens\nand spoilage microorganisms is critical to ensure food safety and quality (Tothill and \nMagan, 2003; Lazcka et al., 2007). \nVarious methods have been developed and are used for the detection of Salmonella spp. \nConventional culture methods involve blending of the food product in a pre-enrichment \nmedia to increase the population of the target organism, followed by plating onto \nselective or differential agar plates to isolate pure cultures. These are then examined by \nphenotypic analysis or metabolic markers. A major drawback is that these methods are \nlabour-intensive and also take 2\u20133 days for the results to be known and up to 7\u201310 days \nfor confirmation (June et al., 1996, Tothill, 2006). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays\n(ELISA), although faster than the conventional culture methods, still require sample \nenrichments before analysis (3 h to conduct the assay) (Schneid et al., 2006). Recently \nmethods based on nucleic acid probes and polymerase chain reactions (PCR) have been \nused. Although, the total time frame of the analysis is still several hours and requires \nPage 4 of 28\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n4\ntrained personnel to conduct the assays (Mozola, 2006). The development of biosensors \nfor microbial detection and identification resulted in the availability of methods which are \nrapid, sensitive and simple to perform (Alocilja and Radke, 2003). These technologies \ncome with unique capabilities for real-time and on site analysis (Tothill and Turner, \n2003). Real-time detection of pathogenic contaminants is important since it provides \nimmediate interactive information regarding the sample being tested and enables food \nfacilities to take corrective measures before the product is released for consumption. \nThis paper focuses on the development of an electrochemical immunosensor for\nSalmonella typhimurium analysis as a rapid and sensitive method for future deployment \nfor on site diagnosis. Electrochemical immunosensors present the advantages of high \nsensitivity of an electrochemical transducer and selectivity inherent to the use of \nimmunochemical interactions (Tothill, 2003). In this work a sandwich ELISA format was \ndeveloped where the capture antibody (mouse monoclonal antibody raised against \nSalmonella typhimurium) was immobilized on the gold electrode surface. A second \nantibody (rabbit polyclonal antibody against Salmonella) conjugated to an enzyme label,\nhorseradish peroxidise (HRP) was used as the detection antibody which will recognise \nthe captured cells. The detection of the enzyme label is then conducted using an \nelectrochemical system comprise an electron transfer mediator, 3,3\u2019,5,5\u2019-\ntetramethylbenzidine dihydrochloride (TMB) with H2O2 as the substrate system. TMB \nhas been reported to be a good mediator for the electrochemical detection of low levels of \nHRP when TMB-H2O2 is used as the substrate system (Volpe et al., 1998). \n2.

The solvent (thinner) \nfor the ink 242SB was type 402, Agmet ESL, Reading, UK.\n2.2 Buffers and solutions\nPhosphate buffered saline (PBS), comprising of 0.13mM  NaH2PO4, 0.5mM Na2HPO4\nand 0.51mM NaCl, pH 7.4 was prepared by dissolving five buffer tablet in 1l distilled-\ndeionised water. Citrate-phosphate buffer 0.05M, pH 5.5 was prepared by dissolving one \nbuffer tablet in 100 ml of distilled- deionised water. TMB substrate solution was prepared \nby dissolving 1mg of TMB in 150\u00b5l of distilled- deionised water. \n2.3 Bacterial cultures and food samples\nSalmonella typhimurium (Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica, ATCC\u00ae 53648) was \nobtained from LGC Promochem, Middlesex, UK. Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterobacteria \nspp, Pseudomonas sp, Staphylococuss aureaus were donated by Bedford Hospital \n(Bedford, UK). The strains were maintained in 50% glycerol in nutrient broth at -20oC. \nThe pure culture of bacterial strains was grown on nutrient agar plates at 37 oC for 24 h\nand then stored at 4 oC until used. Salmonella chromogenic agar (SCA) was prepared by \nmixing 25 g of Salmonella agar with 1 vial of Salmonella chromogenic supplement in \nPage 6 of 28\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n6\n500 ml of sterile water and heat until boil. The agar was then poured into a sterile \ndisposable plastic Petri dish at 40 oC under a laminar flow.   XLT-4 was prepared by \nmixing 59 g of XLT-4 agar with 4.6 ml of XLT-4 selective supplement in 1liter of sterile \nwater and heat until boil. Nutrient broth medium and buffered peptone water were\nprepared by mixing 13 g and 28 g respectively in 1 liter of water and autoclaved for 15 \nminute at 121oC. \nChicken meat samples (12 samples) were purchased from a local retailer outlet in Milton \nKeynes, UK.  The meat samples were immediately place in sterile buffered peptone water \nfor pre-enrichment before use. Full procedure is listed in Section 2.9.\n2.4   Preparation of Salmonella cells\nSalmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium was used as a standard \nreference for Salmonella detection. The Salmonella typhimurium inoculum was prepared \nby sub-culturing from an overnight culture plate into nutrient broth (10 ml) in a 25 ml \nuniversal bottle and incubated in an incubator shaker (100 rpm, 37 oC, 24h). A 10 ml was \nthen used to inoculate a second Duran bottle containing 100 ml nutrient broth and \nincubated for 24 h at 37oC. Cell harvesting was then carried out using centrifugation \n(Hettich Rotina 38, Germany) at 3,000 rpm, 30 min. at room temperature. The cells were \nwashed three times with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and than resuspended in PBS to \nthe required dilution. Optical density of the harvested cells was measured at 600 nm \n(UV\/VIS spectrophotometer, Perkin-Elmer Lambda 20, GenTech Scientific, Inc. USA)\nand appropriate 10 fold serial dilutions (10-2, 10-3, 10-4, 10-5, 10-6, 10-7, 10-8, 10-9 and 10-\n10) of the Salmonella suspension were prepared in saline (0.85%). A 0.1ml of each \ndilution was spread plated on to Chromogenic Agar plate and the plates were incubated \novernight at 37 oC for 24 h. Colony forming unites (CFU) on the agar plates were then \ncounted as CFU ml-1.\nPage 7 of 28\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n7\n2.5. Fabrication of screen - printed gold electrode\nScreen-printed gold electrodes (SPGE) consisting of gold working electrode, carbon \ncounter electrode and silver-silver chloride pseudo - reference electrode were fabricated \nin-house according to the procedure described in details by Noh and Tothill (2006). The \nscreen-printed gold electrodes (SPGE) used in this work, consisting of a gold working \nelectrode (1.3 mm2 planar area), printed on a graphite ink layer (dried at 120 oC, 30 min.).\nAll electrodes were then tested using a multimeter before use. The sensors adge \nconnector was purchased from Maplin Electronics Ltd. (Milton Keynes, UK).\n2.6. Electrochemical measurements\nElectrochemical measurements were carried out by placing a 100 \u03bcl solution onto the \nelectrode, covering the three electrodes area. Each measurement was carried out in \ntriplicates using a new strip in a non-deaerated and unstirred solution.  Measurements \nwere performed using the Autolab Type II (Eco Chemie, The Netherlands) with General \nPurpose Electrochemical System (GPES) 4.7 software. Cyclic voltammetric \nmeasurements were carried out by scanning at 50 mV s-1 between -0.3V to+ 0.8 V \nrelative to on board Ag-AgCl reference electrode. Stock solutions of 50 mM potassium \nferrocyanide were prepared in 0.1 M KCl. For the selection of optimal potential for \nTMB-H2O2-HRP system, chronoamperometry was conducted with bare screen-printed \ngold electrodes with buffer solution (0.05M Citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 5.5, in 0.1M \nKCl), substrate (4 mM TMB in Citrate-phosphate buffer in 0.1M KCL), substrate and \nmediator (4 mM TMB and 0.06% H2O2 in Citrate-phosphate buffer in 0.1M KCl) and \nsubstrate-mediator-enzyme system (4 mM TMB, 0.06% H2O2 and IgG conjugate \nperoxidase in Citrate-phosphate buffer in 0.1M KCl).  Step amperometry was conducted \nat a range of potential from + 600 mV to -600 mV within 600s.  \n2.7. Optimisation of the immunosensor response\nA 10 \uf06dl of (10 \uf06dg ml-1, 25 \uf06dg ml-1, 50 \uf06dg ml-1 and 100 \uf06dg ml-1) monoclonal antibody \nsolutions (in 0.05 M carbonate-bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6) was dropped on the electrode \nsurface for 2 h at 37oC in a humid conditions. The electrodes were then washed with \nPage 8 of 28\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n8\nphosphate buffer saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and with distilled water.\nThe electrodes were then blocked for 30 min., 37 oC using milk solution (1:10 dilution in \nPBS). Salmonella cell at 107 CFU ml-1 were used as the sample and placed on the gold \nworking electrodes and incubated 2 h at 37 oC. Polyclonal antibody - HRP (100 \uf06dg ml-1) \nin PBS with milk at 1:40 dilution was added to the electrode after washing with PBS-T \nand incubated for 30 minute at 37 oC. All measurements were performed by adding 100\n\uf06dl of 4 mM TMB and 0.06% H2O2 in 0.05 M citrate phosphate buffer prepared in 0.1M \nKCl using chronoamperometry at -200mV for 200s - 300s. Same procedure was used to \noptimise rabbit polyclonal antibody \u2013HRP conjugate. A fixed concentration of \nmonoclonal antibody (10 \uf06dl of  25 \uf06dg ml-1) and vary concentration of the conjugate \nconcentration (50\uf06dg ml-1, 100 \uf06dg ml-1, 250 \uf06dg ml-1, 500 \uf06dg ml-1) was used.\nTwo immobilisation procedures were examined for monoclonal antibody coating on the \nelectrode surface, passive adsorption and covalent immobilisation. Passive adsorption\nwas conducted by coating the working electrode with an aliquot of 10 \uf06dl (25 \uf06dg ml-1) of\nmonoclonal antibody solution and allowed to incubate for 2 h at 37oC under controlled \nhumidity. Electrodes were then washed and blocked as above. Various dilutions of \nSalmonella cells (101 \u2013 107 CFU ml-1) were added onto the electrodes surface and \nincubated (2 h, 4 oC). The assay was then completed as described above using rabbit \npolyclonal antibody- HRP conjugate (10 \uf06dl, 250 \uf06dg mL-1) in PBS with milk at 1:40 \ndilution.\nFor covalent immobilisation the gold working electrode was covered with 10 \uf06dl of 50 mg\nml-1 carboxymethyldextran in deionised water (overnight at room temperature), then \nwashed with deionised water and dried using gentle N2 flow. A 10 \uf06dl of an equal volume \nof EDC-NHS (0.4 M EDC and 0.1M NHS prepared in deionised distilled water) was then \nplaced on the electrode surface (10 min. at room temperature), washed with deionised \ndistilled water and gently dried using N2 flow. A 10 \uf06dl of the antibody solution (25 \uf06dg ml-\n1 of mouse monoclonal antibody against Salmonella typhimurium dissolved in 0.05M \nacetate buffer pH 4.5) was then pipetted over the surface. Excess ester groups were then\nPage 9 of 28\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n9\nblock with 10 \uf06dl of 1M ethanolamine-HCl. The surface was then blocked with 10 \uf06dl of \nmilk solution (1:10 dilution in PBS) and incubated for another 30 min. at 37oC. Various \ndilutions of Salmonella cells (0 \u2013 107 CFU mL-1) were added to the electrodes and \nincubated for 2 h at 37 oC. The assay was then performed as described above. Calibration \ncurve was fitted with a non-linear regression using the following four parameter logistic \nequation (Tijssen, 1985).\n              a \u2013 d \ny   =                         +  d\n            1  + (x\/c)k   \nWhere, (y) is response (current) obtained, (a) and (d) the maximum and minimum values \nof calibration curve, respectively, (x) is the concentration at the EC50 value, (c) the \nSalmonella concentration and (k) is the hillslope.\nDetection limit (LOD) was calculated based on the following equation (Tijssen, 1985).\n                                                  -1\/k\n                     a \u2013 d                     \nLOD =  x                        -  1   \n                    (a \u2013 d) -3s\nWhere, s is for standard deviation of the zero value. \n2.8. Cross reactivity studies\nGram negative (Enterobacteria spp, Klebsiela pneumonia and Pseudomonas spp) and \ngram\u2019s positive (Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria were used to examine the specificity of \nthe immunosensor. A 10 \uf06dl of 25 \uf06dg ml-1 monoclonal antibody against Salmonella \ntyphimurium was immobilized on the gold surface following the procedure described in \nsection 2.7. A 10 \uf06dl of each bacterial solution (1.0x 109 CFU ml-1) was used as the \nsample and incubated for 2 hrs at 37 oC. Salmonella cells were used at (5\u00d7107 cells ml\u22121) \nsince this gives the highest signal using the immunosensor and was reported as the 100% \nsignal. Polyclonal antibody- HRP (250 \uf06dg ml-1) in PBS with milk at 1:40 dilution was \nused as the detection antibody. The procedure was also repeated on a microtiter plate for \nPage 10 of 28\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n10\ncomparison using the same reagents listed above (100 \uf06dl of 25 \uf06dg ml-1 monoclonal \nantibody,  100 \uf06dl  of bacterial suspension, 100 \uf06dl Polyclonal antibody- HRP of 250 \uf06dg \nml-1 in PBS with milk at 1:40 dilution) and a 100 \uf06dl of TMB substrate solution. The \nabsorbance was measured at 450 nm.  \n2.9 Comparative study \nA fresh chicken breast sample (25 g) was directly incubated in sterile buffer peptone \nwater (225 ml) in 500 ml conical flask for 18-24 h using shaking incubator (300 rpm, 37\noC). This treatment with enrichment buffer peptone is used to recover injured Salmonella \ncells during meat processing. Aliquots from the liquid was then removed and used for \ntesting as listed below.\nChromogenic Agar method\nA 10 \uf06dl of the liquid sample prepared as above was inoculated on the Salmonella \nChromogenic Agar plate using inoculation loop and incubated for 24 h at 37oC. Purple \ncolonies grown on the agar plates are then counted (CFUs), indicate the presence of \nSalmonella in the samples.  \nELISA kit\nLOCATE\u00ae SALMONELLA R-Biopharm ELISA kit (R-Biopharm Rhone LTD, UK)\nprocedure was used in this comparative studies. The preparation of the chicken samples \nwas as reported above. The liquid samples were then heat killed at 80 oC for 30 minute in\na water bath as recommended by the procedure supplied with the kit. A 100 \uf06dl of each \nsample were then pipetted into the ELISA microtitre well and incubated for 30 minutes at \nroom temperature. Salmonella typhimurium pure culture was prepared by serial dilution \n(0 to 1010 CFU ml-1 in PBS) and used as standards following the ELISA procedure\nPage 11 of 28\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n11\nsupplied by the manufacturer. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm using BMG \nFlurostar galaxy ELISA plate reader (Aylesbury, UK). \nSPGE Immunosensor\nThe preparation of the chicken samples was as reported for the ELISA kit (heat killed at \n80 oC for 30 minute). A 10 \uf06dl of sample was placed on the gold working electrode\nsurface which has been covalently modified with the antibody on carboxymethyldextran \ncoated gold. The pure culture of Salmonella typhimurium prepared by serial dilution (0 to \n107 CFU ml-1 in PBS) was also incubated using the same procedure as the sample. The \nprocedure was as describe in section 2.7. Colonies of 24 h growth (1-2) of Salmonella \ntyphimurium in nutrient agar were used as a positive control and blank buffered peptone \nwater was used as a negative control. \n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\n3.1 Characterisation and Optimisation of the sensor signal\nThe electrochemical immunosensor system developed in this work for Salmonella\ndetection was based on a direct sandwich ELISA format with horseradish peroxidise \n(HRP) used as the enzyme label and TMB\/H2O2 as the substrate\/mediator system (See \nSchematic Diagram below).\nSchematic Diagram\nCyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis was used to characterize the working gold electrode \nsurface using potassium ferrocyanide. The electrochemical behaviour of potassium \nferrocyanide (0.5 mM) on the SPGE was studied by varying the scan rate, 10mVs-1, \n20mVs-1, 40mVs-1, 60mVs-1 and 80mVs-1. Figure 1, show that the gold working electrode \nperforms well with peak to peak separation (\u0394Ep = Epa - Epc) at 20 mV s-1 was found to be \nPage 12 of 28\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n12\n110 mV, which indicate that the electrochemical reaction is quasi-reversible. The \noxidation\/reduction peaks were more defined when lower scan rates were used. \nCoefficient of variation (%CV) value for reduction current obtain from cyclic voltametry \nanalysis using potassium ferocyanide with five replicate electrode = 4% .\nFigure 1\nIn order to study the optimal potential for the detection system, the current signals \ngenerated from TMB\/H2O2 with HRP-antibody conjugate was analyzed using \nchronoamperometry. The ratio of the signal current to background current using step \namperometry (-600 mV to +600 mV) of 5 mM TMB, 1mM H2O2 with and without the \naddition of IgG-HRP in pH 5.2 citrate buffer, 0.1 M KCl was calculated using an average \nof 5 electrodes.  The results showed that the best potential in this system is -200mV, and \ntherefore this was selected for future immunosensor developments (data not shown).\n3.2 Immunoreagents optimisation\nThe gold working electrode was then used to immobilize the monoclonal antibody using \npassive adsorption and covalent immobilization as reported in the methods section. Both \nprocedures were found to be stable during the duration of the detection assay. The \nimmobilization conditions were optimized as a function of various parameters, including \nthe concentration of capture antibody and secondary antibody- HRP conjugate. While \nkeeping the concentration of carboxymethyldextran constant at 50 mg ml-1 (Biacore \nSensor Surface Handbook), the primary (capture) antibody concentration was varied from \n10 \uf06dg ml-1 \u2013 100 \uf06dg ml-1 to react with reactive succinimide esters to each carboxyl \nterminal at carboxymethyldextran with primary amine groups. As expected, increasing \nthe concentration of the capture antibody resulted in a more sensitive response, indicating\nthe increased availability of antibody recognition sites on the electrode surface until\nsaturation is reached (Figure 2a). This occurred for both types of antibody immobilization \non the gold surface. The primary monoclonal anti-salmonella antibody concentration was, \nPage 13 of 28\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n13\ntherefore chosen at 25 \uf06dg ml-1. This was also chosen for economical reasons and ensures\nthat the test cost will be competitive.  The concentration of polyclonal antibody \u2013 HRP \nconjugated was also optimized as a function of the overall sensitivity of the\nimmunosensor systems (Figure 2b). \nFigure 2\nLinear current signal for covalent antibody immobilization was obtained by coating the \ncaptured antibody at 25 \uf06dg ml-1 and increase the concentration of antibody- HRP \nconjugate from 50 \uf06dg ml-1 to 500 \uf06dg ml-1. A concentration of 250 \uf06dg ml-1 of antibody \nconjugate was chosen as a compromise between sensitivity and overall background signal \ngenerated and also device cost. Passive adsorption gave lower sensitivity than covalent \nimmobilisation using CM-dextran.\n3.3 Salmonella calibration curve using passive antibody adsorption.\nUtilizing the derived optimal concentration of captured antibody and antibody -HRP \nconjugate in the immunosensor system, a calibration curve for Salmonella assay was then \ndetermined (Figure 3).\nFigure 3\nThe sensor LOD was found to be 5.0 x 103 CFU ml-1. Passive adsorption of antibody on \nthe gold electrode surface is simple and rapid but suffers form random attachment of the \nantibody on the gold surface. \n3.4 Salmonella calibration curve using covalent antibody immobilization with\n   Carboxymethyl- dextran \nTo enhance the sensitivity of the immunosensor device, covalent antibody immobilisation \nusing amine-coupling via carboxymethyl-dextran was constructed. The main aim for this \napproach is to increase antibody loading and orientation of the antibody binding sites. \nPage 14 of 28\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n14\nFigure 4, show the standard curve for Salmonella detection ranged from 101 CFU ml-1 to \n107 CFU ml-1 and display the dynamic range and the limit of detection (LOD) which was \ndetermined at ~20 CFU ml-1. \nFigure 4\nThe most frequently applied protein immobilisation method on carboxymethylated \ndextran is using amino coupling with the activation of the carboxyl groups taking place \nby N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) and N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N-ethylcarbodiimide\n(EDC) via carbodiimide chemistry. This will then form NHS esters which will react with \nnucleophilic groups of the ligand under elimination of NHS and formation of a covalent\nbond (O\u2019Shannessy et al., 1992; Johnsson et al., 1995). This method has the advantage of \ntaking place under relatively mild conditions and allowing an easy and rapid \nimmobilization (Barie and Rapp, 2001). This immobilization method gave a very high \nsensitivity for Salmonella cells detection.\n3.5 Cross reactivity of the immunosensor with others bacteria \nThe developed screen-printed immunosensor based on covalent immobilization showed a \nhigh sensitivity for Salmonella typhimurium cells detection in buffer solutions. The \nspecificity of the sensor was investigated in relation to other bacteria such as gram\u2019s \nnegative (Enterobacteria spp, Klebsiela pneumonia and Pseudomonas spp) and gram\u2019s \npositive (Staphylococcus aureus) as the most common bacterial contaminate in food \nsamples (Blackburn et al., 1994). The bacteria were prepared in solutions of 1.0\u00d7109\ncells ml\u22121, and used to test the immunosensor system with CM-dextran modified gold \nsurface. Salmonella cells were used at (5\u00d7107 cells ml\u22121) since this gives the highest \nsignal on the immunosensor and was reported as the 100% signal. The experiment was \nalso repeated using microtiter plate in order to compare the performance of the sensor to \nthe ELISA assay. Table 1, showed that both methods demonstrated similar cross \nreactivity but with much lower readings achieved when the assay was conducted using \nthe microtiter plate format.  Entrobacteria spp gave 20% cross reactivity signal with the \nPage 15 of 28\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n15\nsensor but only 6% with the ELISA plate. The other bacteria showing negligible \ninterference on both methods. Since the assay use monoclonal antibody specific for \nSalmonella as the capture molecule, further investigations need to be conducted to verify \nthe cross-reactivity results with Entrobacteria spp. However, Entrobacteria spp and \nSalmonella spp both belong to the Enterobacteriaceae genera and therefore antigenic \nsimilarity exist between the two bacterial species. Further studies also need to be \nconducted to reduce non-specific binding using the immunosensor since it showed higher \nreadings than the ELISA format. The use of a better negative control such as microbial \ncells with zero cross reactivity with the monoclonal antibody will aid in reducing errors \nin future testing. The specificity of the system using other Salmonella species has not \nbeen conducted due to problems acquiring infectious microorganisms.\nTable 1\n3.6 Comparatives studies for Salmonella determination in chicken meat \nThe presence of pathogenic bacteria in foods needs to be detected at low level (Leonard \net al., 2003) and pre-cooked chicken is an important meat to be examined to test the \nSalmonella immunosensor performance. Fresh chicken samples (6 samples) were used to \ndemonstrate the performance of the immunosensor in comparison with LOCATE\u00ae R-\nBiopharm ELISA Kit and Chromogenic Culture method. Standard curves were conducted \nusing Salmonella typhimurium for the Biopharm ELISA (y =713.60 x -214.00, R2 =0.90) \nand for the immunosensor (y = 5 E-07 x -3E-06, R2 = 0.93) was conducted at the same \ntime and used to calculate cells numbers using the linear slope formula equation. In all \nthree methods sample one and two showed a positive readings (including the \nChromogenic culture method, ~ 4 -5 colonies).  However, the immunosensor showed \nmuch higher cell counts for sample 1 and 2 than the ELISA kit and Chromogenic agar \nmethods with sample 6 also showing positive reading. This could be due to the combined \neffect of non specific binding and cross reactivity of the antibody with other bacterial \nspecies such as Enterobacteria spp.\nPage 16 of 28\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n16\nFigure 5\nFurther optimization of the sensor and the assay procedure using meat samples is \nrequired in order to achieve accurate results and minimize false positive readings. The \noverall results achieved from the immunosensor developed in this work were very \nencouraging. Delibato et al (2006) and Croci et al (2002), obtain 2\u00d7106 CFUml\u22121   and \n5x103 CFUml\u22121 limit of detection (LOD) respectively for Salmonella in meat samples \nusing a sandwich based electrochemical immunosensor on a carbon screen printed \nelectrode. Yang (2008), reported the use of a labeless interdigitated microelectrode\nimmunosensor format using electrical impedance spectroscopy achieving an LOD of 3.45 \nx 106 CFU ml-1  for Salmonella cell suspension in PBS buffer. There are no previously \nreported literatures using an immunosensor format similar to that reported in our work.\nCONCLUSION\nA new approach for the development of an electrochemical immunosensor for salmonella \ndetection has been reported in this study.  This approach uses carboxymethyldextran \nmodified gold electrode surface for covalent antibody immobilization. This is the first \nreport demonstrating the use of this type of sensor for Salmonella detection achieving a\nlow detection limit ~ 21 CFU ml-1 . This is highly beneficial which can enable sample \nanalysis without the pre-enrichment step. The sensor selectivity for Salmonella was good\nin the presence of other bacteria in the samples with higher cross reactivity reported for \nEntrobacteria spp. This needs to be further investigated to eliminate the interfering effect \nof this type of bacteria and also to minimize non specific binding. This can be achieved \nby using different capture antibody and blocking procedure. With further optimisations \nthe immunosensor detection system will be useful in the development of devices for on-\nsite analysis. \nPage 17 of 28\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n17\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors thank the Malaysian Agricultural Research & Development Institute \n(MARDI) for funding this research project.  \nREFERENCES\nAlocilja, E., Radke, S.M., 2003.
