INTRODUCTION\nFor many years, b-decay experiments have proved to be a\npowerful tool to study nuclear systems. Today, they continue\nto provide a wealth of information about fundamental as-\npects of the nuclear medium and the weak interaction. Such\nexperiments are often also the first to provide information\nabout the nuclear structure of new isotopes. The b decay in\nallowed processes is governed by a very simple and well\nunderstood operator, namely, s \u00b7t in the case of a Gamow-\nTeller decay and t for a Fermi decay. Thus, a good and\ncomplete description of the ground state of the parent\nnucleus and of the states populated in the daughter nucleus\nshould provide, in principle, a good value for the total\nstrength and of the strength distribution over the full Qb\nwindow. Hence, the measurements of these quantities offer a\ngood probe to test our theoretical models.\nThe N=Z, A.75 region of the nuclear chart is of particu-\nlar interest in terms of nuclear structure because of the wide\nvariety of nuclear shapes displayed in the region. Competing\nprolate and oblate deformations are predicted due to several\ndifferent energy gaps in the shell model potential at Z ,N\n=34\u201340, the signature of such effects being rapid changes in\nnuclear shape when adding or removing only a few nucleons\n[1,2]. Furthermore, shape coexistence can occur when neu-\ntron and proton shell gaps drive the nucleus towards opposite\ndeformations [3,4]. A typical candidate for such behavior is\nthe neutron-deficient 74Kr isotope which has recently been\nthe subject of several in-beam investigations [5,6]. From\nthese studies, possible shape coexistence in this nucleus was\ninferred from the measurement of the electric-monopole (E0)\ntransition linking the 01\n+ ground state to a second 02\n+ isomeric\nstate.\nThe decay of 74Kr was last studied by Schmeing et al. [7].\nThey established the decay scheme up to 978 keV based on\nhigh resolution g-g and b-g coincidence measurements. The\ntotal b+ and electron capture feeding was determined from\nthe difference between the g feeding and g decay of each\nobserved level. Yet, no direct experimental evidence of de-\nformation or shape coexistence for this nucleus, nor for other\nnuclei in this mass region, has so far been obtained through\nb-decay measurements.\nFor nuclei close to the proton drip line, theoretical calcu-\nlations predict that the Gamow-Teller strength will be con-\ncentrated at high excitation energy in the daughter nucleus\nbut will still be accessible through b-decay studies with ap-\nproximately half of the total strength appearing within the\nb+-decay window [8,9]. Furthermore, the Gamow-Teller\nstrength distribution calculated as a function of the excitation\nenergy in the daughter nucleus depends sensitively on the\nground state deformation of the parent nucleus [9,10].\nAlthough the Gamow-Teller strength distribution BsGTd\ncarries fundamental information about nuclear structure, its\ndetermination is not straightforward and meets difficulties on\nthe experimental side. When germanium detectors are used,\ntheir limited high energy detection efficiency, combined with\nthe b-strength fragmentation at high excitation energy, leads\nto systematic errors in both the total BsGTd and the BsGTd\ndistribution. An alternative method is to use the total absorp-\ntion technique to extract the complete strength distribution.\nThis method is based on measuring the total energy released\nin the g decay of each level populated in the b decay of the\nparent nucleus, and therefore is sensitive to the b population\nof the nuclear levels rather than to the individual g rays. This\ntechnique, which dates back to the work of Duke et al. [11],\n*On leave from Insitute of Nuclear Research, Debrecen, Hungary.\n\u2020On leave from Dpto.

The advantage of\napplying the total absorption technique to N,Z nuclei was\nalready mentioned in Ref. [18].\nWe have revisited the b decay of neutron-deficient kryp-\nton and strontium isotopes using the total absorption spec-\ntrometry technique with the aim of determining the total GT\nstrength and the GT distribution over the whole QEC energy\nwindow. Here we present the results obtained for the 74Kr\nisotope sQEC=3140\u00b162 keVd. The experiment was per-\nformed using a new total absorption spectrometer specifi-\ncally designed for the study of very short-lived nuclei, and\npresently installed at the CERN\/ISOLDE mass separator.\nData were collected and the Gamow-Teller strength extracted\nover most of the QEC window. A comparison of the experi-\nmental strength distribution with self-consistent deformed\nHartree-Fock (HF) plus quasiparticle-random-phase-\napproximation (QRPA) calculations is presented.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section II is devoted to\nthe experimental procedure used in the 74Kr experiment and\nSec. III to the extraction of the strength distribution from the\nraw data. The results are presented in Sec. IV and the ground\nstate deformation of the neutron-deficient 74Kr isotope is dis-\ncussed. Our findings are summarized and conclusions are\ndrawn in Sec. V.\nII. EXPERIMENT\nA new total absorption gamma spectrometer sTAgSd [19]\nhas been designed by a Madrid-Strasbourg-Surrey-Valencia\ncollaboration to study very short-lived nuclei at the CERN\/\nISOLDE mass separator. The spectrometer consists of a\nlarge, cylindrical NaIsTld monocrystal (38 cm diameter,\n38 cm length) with a 7.5 cm hole drilled perpendicular to the\nsymmetry axis. The detector, called Lucrecia and manufac-\ntured by Saint-Gobain Crystals and Detectors, is viewed by\neight 5 in. photomultiplier tubes, type Electron Tubes\n9792B. The crystal is encased in a 13 mm thick aluminum\ncylinder whose thickness is reduced to 11 mm inside the\nradial hole in order to limit the g-ray absorption. Good light\nreflection is provided by a 2 mm thick Al2O3 coating on the\ninner side of the aluminum case. The crystal response stabil-\nity is monitored by a light emitting diode (LED) triggered by\na pulse generator.\nExcellent energy resolution is achieved. The resolution of\nthe NaI crystal was as good as 7.1% and 5.4% at 662 keV\nand 1332 keV, respectively. Experimental total and photo-\npeak efficiencies of 95s8d% and 83s7d%, respectively, were\nmeasured at 662 keV with a calibrated 137Cs source. Finally,\nthese overall good detection efficiencies and energy resolu-\ntions, combined with a solid angle of 97% of 4p, make the\nnew TAgS spectrometer one of the most powerful total ab-\nsorption spectrometers.\nRadioactive isotopes are implanted in a 55 mm thick alu-\nminized mylar tape that can be moved in order to limit the\nbuildup of daughter activity. The tape transport system [20],\nfunctioning under vacuum, routinely operates at a speed of\n1.3 m\/s and possibly at a higher speed of up to 2.0 m\/s. A\nset of three collimators, placed 950 mm, 975 mm, and\n992 mm upstream from the collection point, was used to\nsuppress the beam halo and to define a 638 mm2 beam spot\non the mylar tape. In these experimental conditions, a trans-\nmission of 30% was achieved for a 40Ar stable beam over the\n36 m flight path that separates the high resolution separator\n(HRS) separator from the end of the new RC3 beamline\nwhere the spectrometer is installed. The beamline ends with\na telescopic aluminum tube (1.2 mm thick, 68 mm diameter)\nsealed by a 80 mm kapton window.\nIn order to disentangle the b+ and electron capture (EC)\ncomponents of the decay process, x and g ray as well as\nb-particle detectors located close to the collection point are\nused. A germanium telescope consisting of a 1 cm planar\ndetector backed by a 5 cm thick coaxial crystal is used to\ndetect low energy s8 keV,Eg,500 keVd g rays as well as\nmore energetic g rays. The telescope covers ,14% of the 4p\nsolid angle. The energy resolution obtained with the planar\ndetector is 0.49 keV at 59.5 keV and 2.1 keV at 1332 keV\nwith the coaxial detector. In order to limit the x-ray absorp-\ntion, the end cap of the telescope cryostat is made of a thin\ns0.3 mmd beryllium window. A 2 mm thick plastic (NE102)\ndetector located in front of the germanium telescope and\ncovering 13% of 4p completes the setup and is used to de-\ntect the b particles. This setup allows direct g-ray studies as\nwell as g\u2013g and b\u2013g coincidences to be performed. A sche-\nmatic diagram of the experimental setup is presented in\nFig. 1.\nTo reduce the contribution of the background due to the\nactivity (neutrons and gammas) in the experimental hall, the\nspectrometer and its ancillary detectors are placed inside an\n11 ton shield made of a boron polyethylene s10 cmd, lead\ns5.1 cmd, copper s1.5 cmd, and aluminum s2 cmd sandwich.\nShielding efficiencies of 1.0 and 0.9 were calculated for slow\nsEn,1 eVd and fast sEn,1 MeVd neutrons, respectively,\nusing the MCNPX 2.2.3 code [21]. All the experimental evi-\ndence seems consistent with this shielding efficiency esti-\nmate. The counting rate in the TAgS due to the g back-\nground activity is reduced by a factor of 3.5 down to about\n1.0 kHz with the shielding closed. The residual activity\nmainly comes from the decay of 40K present inside the crys-\ntal. The temperature inside the closed shielding is regulated\nto \u00b10.5 \u00b0C with an industrial air conditioning system.\nThe experiment was carried out at the ISOLDE online\nisotope separator at CERN [22]. The 74Kr ion beam was\nproduced by spallation of a thick s43 g\/cm2d Nb target in-\nduced by an intense 1.4 GeV proton beam delivered by the\nCERN-PSB accelerator. A cooled transfer line connects the\ntarget and the plasma ion source from which the ions are\nextracted in their 1+ charge state and electrostatically accel-\nerated to 60 keV. The cold transmission line strongly sup-\npresses the contamination of noble gas beams by less volatile\nisobars (e.g., directly produced bromine). The isobaric con-\ntamination was found to be negligible, corresponding to a\nE. POIRIER et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 69, 034307 (2004)\n034307-2\nsuppression factor of more than 104, in agreement with pre-\nvious data collected at A=72 and 73 in similar conditions\n[18,23]. The spallation products were analyzed using the\nHRS mass separator, and the average production yield for\n74Kr was 1.53106 atoms\/mC. The mass-separated 74Kr iso-\ntopes were collected in the center of the TAgS spectrometer.\nA total of 190 measurement cycles, each with a duration\nof 170 s, was devoted to the experiment on 74Kr, correspond-\ning to a total counting time of 538 min. Due to the high\nproduction yield, the target only received one of the 14 pro-\nton pulses produced per supercycle, and the ions were col-\nlected on the tape for 1.5 s at the beginning of each cycle. At\nthe end of the experiment, another 358 min were devoted to\nthe measurement of the 74Br daughter activity, and a total of\n65 min was used to measure the room background.\nData were recorded in two separate modes (direct and\ncoincidence) using conventional electronics in NIM and\nFERA-based CAMAC standards. Energy signals from the\nTAgS photomultipliers (eight dynodes) as well as from the\nplastic detector (two dynodes) and the germanium telescope\nwere recorded using peak-sensing converters. Timing signals\nbetween the TAgS and the ancillary detectors were also re-\ncorded on tape in the coincidence mode only.\nIII. ANALYSIS\nThe quantity we are interested in is the Gamow-Teller\nstrength BsGTd as a function of the excitation energy in the\ndaughter nucleus\nBsGTd =\nKIb\nfsQEC \u2212 ExdT1\/2\n, s1d\nwhere Ib is the b branching to a level with Ex excitation\nenergy, fsQEC\u2212Exd is the integral of the Fermi function, T1\/2\nis the b-decay half-life in seconds, and K=3833\u00b124 s\nf24,25g. Extracting the strength over the full energy range\nsimply relies on the accurate determination of the b\nbranchings to all the states to which the decay can pro-\nceed. Although a total absorption spectrometer is sensitive\nto the b population of the nuclear levels rather than to the\nindividual g rays, the task is not trivial. The raw experi-\nmental spectra must be corrected for the effects of various\ndistortions, one of them being electronic pulse pileup.\nThis effect occurs when two pulses overlap and are inter-\npreted by the analyzing system as corresponding to one\nreal event. Analytic solutions exist to calculate the pileup\ncontribution for quadratic or Gaussian pulse shapes. How-\never, because such solutions remain approximate, we use\na numerical pulse pileup correction that requires a knowl-\nedge of the true pulse shape. Details of the correction\nalgorithm and method can be found in Ref. f26g. The cal-\nculated pileup contribution is then normalized to the ex-\nperimental spectrum in the energy region beyond the QEC\nvalue. Second and higher order pileup contributions are\nnegligible s,0.25%d if one limits the counting rate to\n10 kHz or below.\nTo obtain the b-decay strength distribution of the parent\nnucleus from the raw spectra, free of distortion, one must\ngenerally also consider and subtract the background and\ndaughter activity contributions. The corrected energy spectra,\nd (counts\/channel), can then be related to the level feeding\ndistribution f (;N Ib, N=total number of decays) using the\nequation [27]\nd = Rsbd \u00b7 f , s2d\nwhere Rsbd is the response function matrix of the spectrom-\neter which depends on its characteristics. Each column j of\nthis matrix, called the level j response distribution, also de-\npends on the quanta emitted in the decay, positron for b+\ndecay or x ray for EC decay and all the subsequent electro-\nmagnetic contributions sg-ray and\/or conversion electron\ncascadesd. If one considers that the response to a particle\nwith a given energy does not depend on the response to other\nparticles, then the matrix R can be constructed from the in-\ndividual response distributions through successive convolu-\ntions of the adequate single quantum responses f27g. The\nresponse function R depends also on the g-branching ratios b\nin the daughter nucleus, and therefore its computation re-\nquires a knowledge of the level scheme in this nucleus. The\nlow energy part of the level scheme is obtained from high-\nresolution spectroscopy with germanium detectors whereas\nthe unknown upper part is obtained from a decay model of\nthe nucleus. With these assumptions, the TAgS response\nfunction was obtained by means of Monte Carlo simula-\ntions using the GEANT4 package [28]. The experimental\nsetup geometry was carefully modeled and the light produc-\ntion process in the NaI crystal was included as described in\nRef. [27]. Results were compared to experimental data ob-\nFIG. 1. Schematic diagram of the experimental setup. Heavy\nions sHId are implanted into an aluminized mylar tape in the center\nof the NaI crystal. All sensitive detectors are placed inside a four\nlayer shielding that reduces the counting rate due to neutron and\ng-background activities. Collimators, placed upstream from the col-\nlection point, limit the beam spot size on the tape.\nBsGTd STRENGTH FROM b-DECAY MEASUREMENTS AND\u0085 PHYSICAL REVIEW C 69, 034307 (2004)\n034307-3\ntained for different radioactive calibration sources (22,24Na,\n60Co, and 88Y). The photon response matrix was then com-\nputed for radiations with energies ranging from 20 keV to\n8 MeV. The b-response matrix was computed for particles\nwith energies ranging from (Qb=20 keV to Qb=2118 keV\n(i.e., QEC=3140 keV). Finally, in order to obtain the feeding\ndistribution f, Eq. (2) is inverted using the expectation maxi-\nmization method [29].\nBy requiring coincidences of TAgS signals with the bro-\nmine x rays detected in the germanium planar detector, or\nwith positrons detected in the plastic scintillator, we distin-\nguish between events corresponding to EC or b+ decay of\n74Kr, if one disregards the internal conversion process. How-\never, in the case of b+ decay, we do not have the detailed\nknowledge of the plastic detector (e.g., response function to\nlow energy b particles) needed to compute the b efficiencies\nwith high enough accuracy to obtain reliable feedings. More-\nover, the strength at high excitation energy in 74Br is not seen\ndue to the 1022 keV energy fraction always missed in b+\ndecay and to the relatively high b detection threshold sEcut\n,300 keVd cutting off the contribution of low energy b par-\nticles. In addition, the existence of a 4s\u2212d isomeric state in\n74Br with a 41.5 min half-life [30] and an excitation energy\nof 13.8 keV [31], complicates any subtraction of the daugh-\nter activity as the collection-measurement cycles used in the\nkrypton and bromine measurements are different. Therefore,\nwe have limited our analysis to the EC component of the\ndecay by requiring coincidences between the TAgS spec-\ntrometer and the x-ray detector.\nIV. RESULTS\nThe x-ray spectrum from the germanium planar detector\nis shown in Fig. 2. The EC component of the 74Kr decay was\nselected by putting gates on the Ka and Kb transitions in Br\nlocated at 11.9 keV and 13.4 keV, as shown in the figure.\nThe resulting spectrum is displayed in Fig. 3(b) and can be\ncompared to the direct TAgS spectrum shown in Fig. 3(a).\nThe coincidence requirement between the TAgS spec-\ntrometer and the x-ray detector reduces the 74Br daughter\nactivity contribution. Nevertheless, undesired coincidences\nwith background signals underneath the x rays, mainly due\nto the Compton effect or due to the penetration of the b\nparticles into the planar detector, are still possible and must\nbe taken into account. This can be done by subtracting the\nTAgS contribution in coincidence with the background in the\nplanar detector (shaded areas in Fig. 2) from the spectrum\ndisplayed in Fig. 3(b). The final background subtracted EC\nspectrum is displayed in Fig. 3(c). The contents of the spec-\ntrum are combined in 20 keV bins in order to match properly\nthe binning of the calculated response function for further\nanalysis (see Sec. III). The very low statistics beyond the\nQECs74Brd value s6907\u00b115 keVd in Fig. 3(b) suggest that the\nelectronic pulse pileup contribution was negligible and there-\nfore was not taken into account in the analysis.\nThe observed statistics in the final spectrum [Fig. 3(c)]\nbetween the two QEC values (74Kr and 74Br) is only due to\nFIG. 2. X-ray spectrum obtained with the germanium planar\ndetector and showing the Ka and Kb transitions in 74Br. The ex-\npected positions of the Ka and Kb transitions in 74Se are also\nshown.

Because the\ndecay of the 4s\u2212d isomeric state in 74Br sT1\/2=41.5 mind is\nnot favored by our collection-measurement cycle (see Sec.\nII), and according to the decay scheme of 74Br [7], one ex-\npects most of the daughter activity s,80%d to be located\nabove 3 MeV, the EC spectrum is more than 99% free of\nbackground contribution up to QEC s74Krd.\nOne should note that the x-ray\u2013TAgS coincidence is not\nexclusively EC as events corresponding to the b+ decay of\n74Kr can also be selected when the decay is followed by the\nelectron conversion of low energy transitions deexciting lev-\nels in 74Br. From the 74Br level scheme [7], and assuming\ndifferent multipolarities (M1 and E2) for the most intense\nlow energy transitions (62.8 and 89.7 keV), one can estimate\nthe intensity of the internal conversion process following ei-\nther a EC or b+ decay. We found that it amounts to 1.3 and\n4.8% of the total decay intensity, yielding an upper limit of\n8% for the contribution of the b+ process to the x-ray-gated\nTAgS spectrum [Fig. 3(c)]. This contamination, spread over\nthe whole QEC energy window, was not taken into account in\nthe analysis but was included as a systematic error in the\nfinal BsGTd values.\nTo determine the b feedings (see Sec. III), we have con-\nsidered the level scheme of 74Br established by Schmeing\net al. [7] for energies up to 978 keV. We have also taken into\naccount the two 1013.8 and 1060.9 keV g transitions that\nwere identified in Ref. [7] but not placed in the level scheme.\nIn the present work, it was considered that these two transi-\ntions were deexciting levels located at these energies. The\nupper part of the level scheme sEx\u00f81 MeVd was derived\nfrom the statistical nuclear model. The back-shifted Fermi\ngas formula [32,33] was used to generate positive and nega-\ntive parity states with spins J=0, 1, and 2, yielding possible\nE1, M1, E2, and M2 g transitions in the daughter nucleus.\nFor each transition, the g width was calculated using the\ncorrected Weisskopf formula [34]. Only allowed GT transi-\ntions to 1+ states in 74Br (DJ=1, and no parity change) were\nconsidered for the b decay. Based on results obtained for\nneutron-deficient isotopes in the A=75 mass region [35,36],\nthe density parameter a was initially chosen to be 10 MeV\u22121.\nIt was then increased to 11 MeV\u22121 to reproduce the data after\nbetter use of the direct relationship given by Eq. (2). Higher\nvalues for a do not significantly improve the results as, in\nthat case, the mean energy level spacing becomes smaller\nthan the 20 keV binning of the data. The back-shifted ground\nstate position D was fixed at \u22121.36 MeV [33].\nThe resulting b feedings are presented in Table I for en-\nergies up to 978 keV. Despite the relatively poor energy\nresolution of NaI crystals, the analysis method allows us to\nextract the feedings with enough accuracy for a comparison\nwith the values originally obtained by Schmeing et al. [7].\nAlthough both results are similar, discrepancies occur due to\nthe different methods. Our feedings are normalized to one\nover the whole QEC window, not including the 74Br ground\nstate, whereas feedings from Ref. [7] are normalized over the\nfirst 978 keV. Feedings to levels above 1 MeV, not listed in\nthe table, vary from 0.01 to 2% up to 3140 keV. Our experi-\nmental method does not allow us to determine the feeding to\nthe ground level of 74Br as no information is available in the\nspectra. However, because this level has spin and parity 0\u2212 or\n1\u2212, such feeding would primarily come from a first-\nTABLE I. b-branching ratios and BsGTd values in units of gA\n2 \/4p for the 74Br levels as determined in this\nwork and compared to previous values from Ref.

Therefore, this feeding has not been\ntaken into account and we have restricted our analysis to\nallowed Gamow-Teller transitions.\nFrom the b feedings and using the Fermi functions f0 in\nEq. (1), the BsGTd strength was calculated for each transition\nconnecting the ground state of 74Kr to levels in 74Br. Figure\n4 presents the experimental BsGTd strength. Mostly due to\nthe uncertainty in the QEC value s3140\u00b162 keVd, we present\nour results only up to 3 MeV. The total Gamow-Teller\nstrength to states within this energy window is measured to\nbe 0.69s3dgA\n2 \/4p (see Table I). The error bars on Fig. 4 in-\nclude the error in the QEC value that enters into the calcula-\ntion of the f0 Fermi function in Eq. (1). The uncertainty in\nthe 74Kr half-life in the BsGTd calculation, as well as the\nerrors on the feedings coming from the covariance matrices\nobtained as a result of the analysis method [37] are also\ntaken into account. The resulting BsGTd values to levels with\nexcitation energies up to 978 keV are given in Table I and\ncompared to the values from Ref. [7].\nThe experimental results in Fig. 4 are compared to calcu-\nlations based on a deformed HF mean field obtained with the\ndensity-dependent SG2 Skyrme force including pairing cor-\nrelations in the BCS approximation. A residual spin-isospin\nforce is introduced consistently and treated in the QRPA.\nDetails of the calculations can be found in Refs. [38,39]. The\ncalculated GT strength distributions presented in Fig. 4 have\nbeen obtained for the two nuclear shapes, oblate sb0\n=\u22120.15d and prolate sb0=0.39d, that minimize the HF en-\nergy. The strengths are given in units of gA\n2 \/4p and are\nscaled by a factor 0.6 to account for the quenching of the\nstrength [40] as deduced for this mass region from charge\nexchange reactions and b-decay measurements. The theoret-\nical results have been folded with Gaussian functions whose\nwidths are given by the experimental resolution of the spec-\ntrometer. The resulting strength was then accumulated in\n40 keV bins, the same as for the data.\nFigure 4 shows that neither of the two calculated GT\nstrength distributions, from pure oblate or prolate shape, can\nreproduce the experimental BsGTd values over the full range\nof excitation energy. While the oblate calculation [Fig. 4(a)]\nreproduces the strength distribution below 2.0 MeV of exci-\ntation energy, the prolate calculation [Fig. 4(b)] agrees better\nwith the concentration found at higher energies. In that sense\nthe two pictures complement each other. The same conclu-\nsion is obtained from Fig. 5 where we show the experimental\naccumulated GT strength compared to the results of the HF\ncalculations [39,41]. Again, the experimental data lie system-\natically in between the two calculations indicating a possible\nshape mixing in the ground state of 74Kr. Results obtained\nwith other Skyrme forces like Sk3 are qualitatively similar\n[38].\nThis result corroborates the most recent Hartree-Fock-\nBogoliubov calculations predicting a strong mixture of pro-\nlate and oblate shapes in the ground state of 74Kr [42]. It is\nalso consistent with the recent work by Becker et al. [6] that\nconcludes that there is 50:50 mixing between coexisting ob-\nlate and prolate shapes in this nucleus. Thus, the present\nwork brings an additional and independent experimental con-\nfirmation of the ground state shape mixing in 74Kr following\nnumerous in-beam experiments (see Refs. [5,6] and refer-\nences therein).\nFIG. 4.

The calcu-\nlations were performed using the SG2 Skyrme interaction.\nFIG. 5. Accumulated GT strength in 74Kr as a function of the\nexcitation energy of the daughter nucleus.

PHYSICAL REVIEW C 69, 034307 (2004)\n034307-6\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nA new TAgS spectrometer has recently been successfully\nused to study the neutron-deficient Kr and Sr isotopes at\nISOLDE\/CERN. The experimental Gamow-Teller BsGTd\nstrength of 74Kr has been measured for the first time over\nmost of the QEC window. A total strength of 0.69s3d gA2 \/4p\nhas been measured for states with excitation energy up to\n3 MeV. Comparisons of the data with HF-BCS-QRPA calcu-\nlations from 0 to 3 MeV indicate a possible shape mixing in\nthe ground state of 74Kr which is found to be neither oblate\nnor prolate.\nFor the first time, information on the nuclear shape of\nunstable nuclei in the A=75 mass region has been inferred\nfrom b-decay studies. Although this method is model depen-\ndent, it opens new possibilities for probing the nuclear struc-\nture of other nuclei provided that one undertakes the neces-\nsary theoretical developments to extract unambiguous results\nfrom our strength distribution measurements in the case of\nshape mixing.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors would like to thank their colleagues, engi-\nneers, and technicians, from the IReS-Strasbourg and CLRC-\nDaresbury, whose collaboration has been so valuable during\nthe development of the TAgS project and during the first\nexperiment.
