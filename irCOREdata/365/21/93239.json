However, local government can often prove \nto be an ambiguous arena for state society relations. It is that part of the state closest \nto people and as such has the potential to engage more effectively with women and to \naddress their interests. Nevertheless, however circumscribed, competing interests \nremain clustered around power and resources at local government level in ways that \nexclude women. Informal systems and relationships cut across local governance, \nlimiting the space for women\u2019s participation and for taking up issues important to \nthem. When the impulse for decentralisation is efficiency rather than equity, gender \ninterests are less likely to be addressed. These conclusions are drawn from a study of \nlocal government reform and decentralisation in South Africa following the first \nnational non-racial democratic elections in 1994. \n \nSince South Africa\u2019s transition to a liberal democracy, government efforts to advance \ngender equity have been held up as a beacon of good practice across the world. \nHowever, experience of democratic reform has demonstrated that local government \nposes particular challenges for advancing gender equity in policy and increasing \nwomen\u2019s representation in politics. It was at local level that women in civil society \norganised most vigorously and effectively during certain moments of opportunity \nduring the anti-apartheid struggle. However, this has been difficult to sustain in the \n 4\npost-apartheid era and the article seeks to explain why. Two sets of issues are \nparticularly highlighted. The first relates to the entrenchment of local relationships \nand power structures, particularly traditional authorities and their role in the conduct \nof local governance. The second relates to the nature of decentralisation in South \nAfrica and the fact that policies addressing women\u2019s gender interests, developed in \nthe early 1990s on the assumption of a strongly egalitarian and interventionist state, \nare at odds with the neo-liberal framework that has characterised decentralisation \npolicy in South Africa since the late 1990s. Both sets of issues are closely related to a \ndevelopment agenda that is being pursued largely at the expense of an engendered \nlocal democracy. Given the careful attention paid to women\u2019s representation in terms \nof national structures and policy, this article considers why the egalitarian and \nparticipatory model adopted at national level has not taken root in local governance.   \nOn the contrary, local government seems to be more responsive to the interests of \nconservative groups. Second, it is characterised by the model of a contracting state \nthat is more likely to pursue partnership with private firms and developers than with \ncitizens, and this at the expense of a thoroughly democratic form of decentralisation. \n \nProblems of engendering local governance lie not only with the state. Women\u2019s \nparticipation and representation in organisations within society is by no means \nguaranteed. While women in community and local level organisations mobilised \nvigorously and effectively at certain opportune moments during the anti-apartheid \nstruggle, this has been difficult to sustain in the post-apartheid era. This is despite the \nfact that women are galvanised by the delivery of local services important to them and \nother issues falling within the remit of local government. Here problems of joining up \nand scaling up diverse activities at community level pertain, as does the tendency of \n 5\nbroad-scale social movements to capitalise on women\u2019s organisation without \naddressing their gender interests. Critically drawing on the South African experience, \nthe analysis points to some of the paradoxes for women of decentralisation policies \nand how contrary to conventional thinking, women face greater obstacles to political \nengagement at the local than the national level.  \n \nDecentralisation and Engendering Democracy  \nFrom the mid-1980s countries throughout the world began experimenting with some \nform of decentralisation, early examples in sub-Saharan Africa being Ghana, Nigeria, \nTanzania and Zambia.1 By the mid-1990s, 80 per cent of countries, all with very \ndifferent political dispensations, were engaged in some form of decentralisation2 \nWhether understood in an administrative sense,3 as a policy framework \u2018in which \npublic goods and services are provided primarily through the revealed preferences of \nindividuals by market mechanisms\u20194 or in relation to an explicit democratising \nfunction5 decentralisation has become one of the core components of political \nconditionality in international development cooperation.6 While the decentralisation \nagenda has been heavily donor-driven, disenchantment with bloated central \nbureaucracies and kleptocratic national states has not been confined to international \ndevelopment agencies. Democrats have also turned to decentralisation as a favoured \nas a mechanism for improving accountability and transparency and state society \nrelations.7 In other words, strengthening local government has been justified both as a \nmeans of making government more efficient and effective (weak decentralisation) and \nas a way of increasing democratic participation (strong decentralisation).  \n 6\nDecentralisation nevertheless has its sceptics. Heller points out that there are no a \npriori reasons why more localized forms of governance are necessarily democratic \nand suggests that under some contexts decentralised authority can be quite \npernicious.8 The most obvious example of this is indirect rule under colonialism, \nwhen local despots in the service of an imperial power exercised decentralized \nauthority. This is pertinent to the contemporary South African situation where it can \nbe argued that traditional authorities are providing local government on the cheap on \nbehalf of central government in a system that shares some parallels with indirect rule. \nLocalised forms of governance have the potential for elite capture, can tend towards \npork-barrel politics and offer no improvement on central government when \nbureaucratic control is unreasonable. More immediately, when decentralisation is \naccompanied by policies promoting the marketization of public services this leads to \nproblems of affordability for low-income people and in turn local government is often \ndeprived of the human or financial resources to cope with the demands made upon it \nby decentralisation.9 In the event, it has been argued that there is little empirical \nevidence to support or refute the efficacy of decentralisation.10  \n \nAs with decentralisation, the term governance can be used in either a technical or \npolitical sense. At its simplest it refers to the relationship between government and \ncitizen but there are two ways in which the concept is used to describe this \nrelationship. The first understands governance as sound administration and \nmanagement of public resources, weak governance if you will. The second and \nbroader definition sees governance not so much as a set of functions as an expression \nof power between state and civil society, understood as two sides of the same coin, \n 7\nimplying a much stronger form of governance. Stoker11 argues that the \u2018essence of \ngovernance is the interactive relationship between and within government and non-\ngovernmental forces\u2019. Both perspectives inform the arguments of those who see local \ngovernance as important arena for advancing women\u2019s participation and \nrepresentation. For example, the International Union of Local Authorities12 has \nargued in their position paper on women in local government that: \nFrom a gender perspective local government is the closest and is the most \naccessible level of government to women. Local governments traditionally \nprovide services utilized by individual households such as electricity, waste \ndisposal, public transport, water, schools, health clinics and other social \nservices. The decisions of local governments therefore have a direct impact on \nthe private lives of women, because they are traditionally responsible for \nproviding for and caring for the family and the home in many countries. \nWomen also have important and unique contributions to make to the \ndevelopment and appropriate management of these services. They must be \nfully part of the local democratic system and have full access to the decision \nmaking structure. Until the interests of women have been represented at the \nlocal level, the system is not fully democratic. \nThe reasons why local politics are thought to be easier for women are well rehearsed. \nEvertzen sites then as follows:13  \n \n\u2026 because eligibility criteria for the local level are less stringent, and local \ngovernment is the closest to the women\u2019s sphere of life, and easier to combine \nwith rearing children. It can be the first level that women can break into and as \n 8\nsuch it may serve as a springboard to national politics, by developing \ncapacities and gaining experiences. Likewise local politics can be more \ninteresting to women as they are well acquainted with their community, being \nthe major users of space and services in the local community (water, \nelectricity, waste disposal, health clinics, and other social services). They also \nparticipate actively in organisations in their neighbourhood, and it\u2019s easier to \ninvolve these organisations in formal political decision making at the local \nlevel.  \nThese same factors have been marshalled in support of decentralisation as a route \ntowards enhancing gender equity. For example, there are expectations that \ndecentralisation will make service delivery more gender sensitive through the \nproximity of locally elected representatives to their constituents. The latter in turn is \nthought to ensure better understanding of the gender dimensions of service \nrequirements and community needs. Efficiency arguments also point to the efficacy of \nwomen\u2019s community level engagement, where their contribution is seen as an asset in \nensuring effective local planning and management.  \n \nWhile the ideal of democratic decentralisation does hold out promise to women, ideal \nconditions rarely prevail. Manor has pointed out that the limited evidence available on \nthe impact of democratic decentralisation on women \u2018offers only modest \nencouragement\u2019 as prejudices against women are often more strongly held at local \nthan at higher levels.14  One of the reasons for the disappointment of local \ngovernment for women is that it is particularly responsive to informal institutions, \nsystems and relations of power, rather than formal rules and procedures. This serves \n 9\nto advantage men because women\u2019s historical exclusion from local government \nmeans that they do not have access to the same kinds of networks and are less \nexperienced and adept than men at developing them. Thus one of the reasons \nadvanced as to why local government is less productive for advancing women\u2019s rights \nthan is often expected is because the informal institutions in which local governments \nare often embedded are hostile to women. This is demonstrated and confirmed by the \nexperience of South Africa particularly in relation to traditional authority systems, \nwhich remain deeply antithetical towards women and yet are centrally implicated in \nthe exercise of local governance.   \n \nLocal Government Reform in South Africa \nThe end of apartheid changed the face of South African local government irrevocably. \nHowever, democratising sub-national tiers of government was bound to be awkward \ngiven South Africa\u2019s history as a country divided spatially along racial and ethnic \nlines and the fact that these divisions were most obviously and keenly felt at local \nlevel.  At the time of the negotiated settlement in South Africa the attention of all \nparties was firmly focused on control of the central state and the nature of provincial \ngovernment so that local government was at first neglected. Chapter 10 of the Interim \nConstitution dealt with local government and as Spitz (2000:183) has observed, \u2018[I]ts \nmost striking characteristic was its sparseness\u2019, doing little more than creating a loose \nframework for how it was to operate. At the central level a fierce battle ensued \nbetween the forces of reaction that hoped for a federalist or consociational solution \nand the African Nation Congress, which wanted majority rule in a strong central state, \nconcentrating on securing national jurisdiction and rationalising the multiple \n 10\nprovincial and Bantustan administrations into a single South African system of sub-\nnational government.15 Local government thus became a residual category in relation \nto which the African National Congress made a number of initial concessions. For \nexample, elements of consociational government, having been denied nationally, were \nensured at local level, meaning that significant decisions could not be taken without \nthe consensus of minority residents.16 Although this was later overturned, as \nRobinson has observed, local government became the site on which existing privilege \nwas most robustly defended.17\n \nThe Local Government Transition Act (Act 209 of 1993) defined a three-stage \nprocess for the restructuring of local government. First, elections were held for \ntransitional local councils in 1995\/6,18 allowing for some continuity of delivery until \nthe second phase of local government reform was in place. Second, the establishment \nof the Municipal Demarcation Board followed in 1998 in order to redraw municipal \nboundaries across the country.19 Although presented as a technical exercise, the \ndemarcation process was also an intensely political one. Concerned in part with \novercoming the legacies of apartheid planning and racially skewed resource \ndistribution, it brought the ruling party into contestation with traditional leaders who \nsaw the process as disregarding the boundaries of traditional authority areas in a \nprocess that reduced the number of municipalities from 843 to 284.20 The third stage \nof fully-fledged democratic local government followed the local elections in 2000. By \nthe time of the second local government elections in 2000 the autonomy of local \ngovernment was ensured and could only be withdrawn at the risk of infuriating the \nthousands of ANC local councillors who had vested interests in protecting the powers \nof local government, a good proportion of whom were women. \n 11\n Nevertheless, the setting up of structures and procedures proved to be complicated, \ngiven the absence of any effective local government in South Africa outside of the \nformer white areas during the apartheid era.  In urban areas the Black Local \nAuthorities set up in the late 1970s were not sustainable, having lost legitimacy and \nvirtually collapsed. In rural areas local government functions remained largely in the \nhands of traditional leaders who worked within and alongside apartheid structures, in \na system not dissimilar to indirect rule inherited from the colonial era. Through this \ntraditional authorities had amassed considerable local level power and they were keen \nnot to see this dissipate under a new dispensation. The Local Government Transition \nAct provided little guidance on how local government councils in rural areas should \nbe constituted and it was left to provincial government to decide on the form rural \nlocal government should take. The result was that traditional leaders were able to \nentrench their powers over a relatively lengthy period of transition and this was to \nbode ill for women\u2019s representation and influence over the longer term.21  \n  \nWomen and Local Government in South Africa \nShortly after coming to power in 1994 the ruling African National Congress adopted a \nnon-sexist constitution and a strategy for setting in place South Africa\u2019s celebrated \nnational machinery for advancing gender equality. 22  This placed South Africa at the \ncutting edge of experience in state initiated gender policies and structures.23 As a \nresult South Africa is heralded internationally as having one of the most progressive \npolicy frameworks for improving the condition and representation of women.24 \nNevertheless, South Africa\u2019s structures and processes for achieving gender equity still \n 12\nmerit critical scrutiny particularly when viewed from the bottom up.25 During the \nearly transitional period government strategies in relation to women\u2019s representation \nin politics were sorely neglectful of the local level.26 One factor inhibiting women \nfrom taking their rightful place in a process of democratic consolidation has been a \npreoccupation with technocratic structures and procedures for engendering \ngovernance. According to Manicom this has served to depoliticise the goal of a non-\nsexist democracy: \nThere is no question that this \u2018gender offensive\u2019 has resulted in a profound \nshift in the norms, structures, and practices of national and supranational \ninstitutions of governance. But there are questions about the application of \n\u2018gender\u2019 in governance \u2026. Systematic \u2018engendering\u2019 risks standing in for \nfeminist\/gender activism.27  \nMoreover, as transition loomed activists turned to electoral strategies to advance the \nposition of women and inevitably began focusing at the national level.28  \n \nAlong with others involved in the negotiation process, women also woke up late to \nthe strategic importance of the local level for advancing gender equity because the \nbroader effort during the negotiated transition was at the national and provincial \nlevels. The movement of women towards securing the national project also left local \nleadership depleted. Indeed, it was only the repeated lobbying on the part of one small \nCape Town based advocacy organisation, the Gender Advocacy Programme, which \nled the Commission on Gender Equality to eventually take up the importance of \nwomen\u2019s representation in local government. Following the poor showing of women \n 13\nin the 1995\/6 elections the Gender Advocacy Programme began to organise around \nlocal government representation.29  In the run up to the 2000 local government \nelections the Commission for Gender Equality also embarked on a campaign to \nincrease the representation of women in local government and to ensure that \ngovernment became more responsive to women\u2019s interests and demands.  \n \nIn the former goal at least they were successful. Following the 1995\/96 local \ngovernment elections only 19 per cent of councillors were women, resulting in \nheavily male dominated local councils. However, after the local government elections \nin 2000 elections women constituted 28.2 per cent of all local government \ncouncillors.30 One crucial explanatory factor was that by the time of the second local \ngovernment elections proportional representation was matched by a ward system on a \nfifty-fifty basis at local level,31 changing the gender balance of local councillors.32 \nThe Municipal Structures Act of 1998, which included guidelines stating that \u2018every \nparty must seek to ensure that 50 per cent of the candidates on the party list are \nwomen and that women and men candidates are evenly distributed through the list\u2019, \nlargely promoted this.33 Legislation also provided that there should be equal \nrepresentation between women and men on the Ward Committees, something fought \nfor by the Gender Advocacy Programme among others and rightly considered to be a \nsignificant victory at the time. While these were guidelines rather than statutory \nrequirement the African National Congress nevertheless increased its quota of women \nto 46 per cent at local level.34 Significantly, a number of the increased proportion of \nwomen local councillors were elected as ward candidates and did not only enter local \ngovernment through the proportional representation system, showing that women \n 14\npolitical representatives are coming to be accepted at local level in South Africa \nalthough performance across the country was patchy.  \n \nThe deficiencies of the ward system for women were particularly apparent in the \nstatistics for KwaZulu-Natal where traditional authorities remain strong. Here, while \n34.3 per cent of seats for women were achieved through the party list women \noccupied only 12 per cent of ward seats.35 Although the proportional representation \nsystem works in favour of women, a mature democracy should be able to field elected \nwomen candidates at ward level as well. After all, being accountable to a generic \nconstituency of women \u2018out there\u2019 is different from being directly accountable to \nactual women constituents on the ground. In this the local level is in advance of other \ntiers of government in terms of ensuring women\u2019s real political presence. The ward \ncommittees are also proving to be a key route for civil society participation, alongside \nconsiderable increases in women\u2019s representation. A critical question is the extent to \nwhich this translates into a system of engendered democratic decentralisation in \nwhich gender interests are addressed. \n \nWeak and Strong Decentralisation in South Africa \n \nIn 1998 the Local Government White Paper advanced the concept of \u2018developmental \nlocal government\u2019 and determined that municipalities pursue integrated development \nplanning in a context of inter-sectoral partnerships that required the active \ninvolvement of communities, alongside other vested interest groups, through both \n 15\npublic and private investment.36 1 From the outset the African National Congress saw \ndevelopmental local government as a vehicle for national development. Local \ngovernment was given constitutional protection alongside a constitutional claim to the \npowers necessary to provide services for its residents, including fiscal capability. \nWhile provincial government is financed mainly through transfers from the centre, \nlocal government is responsible for raising over 90 per cent of its own revenue.  \n \nLocal governments have a number of sources of revenue, the main ones being rates on \nproperty and surcharges on fees for services provided by or on behalf of the \nmunicipality. Other sources of revenue are allowed but explicitly exclude income tax, \nvalue-added tax, general sales tax and customs duties. 37  Although decentralisation \nhas meant that local government is responsible for some basic service delivery, this is \nalso the responsibility of both provincial and local governments, with local \ngovernment as the junior partner in the intergovernmental fiscal system.38  However, \nthere is considerable variation between at one end of the spectrum the large \nmetropolitan municipalities that achieve a level of financial autonomy and at the \nother, small rural councils with scant fiscal capacity and a heavy dependence on \nnational government transfers through a system known as the \u2018equitable share\u2019. This \nhas to temper the view that the relative financial autonomy of local government is an \nindicator of strong decentralisation. National government became enchanted with the \nmanagerial potential of decentralisation, giving rise to a plethora of technocratic \nprocedures that were institutionalised without sufficiently sustained attention being \npaid to local level representation and participation. Moreover, as McDonald and Pape \nhave argued, decentralisation was accompanied by cutbacks in central government \n                                                 \n1 Policy frameworks predicated upon the constitutional principles of inter-governmental cooperation \ninclude infrastructural support programmes, planning guidelines, service partnerships and a range of \nlocal economic development initiatives. \n 16\nallocation to local authorities, rendering the market logic more pressing.39 If \ndevelopmental local government simply means central government shifting \nresponsibility for service delivery to the local level through a series of unfunded \nmandates, decentralisation in South Africa can be characterised as weak.  \n \nFollowing the April 2004 national elections the government signalled a shift towards \nincreased pro-poor spending given that the macro-economy had now been stabilised. \nHowever, limited resources and expanded responsibilities of local government for \nservice delivery have made cost recovery almost inevitable. The impact on many poor \nurban residents has been devastating. Cut-offs have been employed both in respect of \nindividual households that cannot afford services and as a more widespread strategy \nto punish whole communities for non-payment. In some cases this has even extended \nto service providers ripping out infrastructure.40 Under such circumstances not only \nare decentralisation strategies potentially dangerous for local governments, with their \nconstitutional responsibility for the social and economic development of communities, \nbut also for communities and citizens.  \n \nThere is another side to developmental local government that points towards \ndemocratic decentralisation, that being constitutional commitment to popular \nparticipation in local government, including women as a distinct constituency. Local \nauthorities are required to undertake medium-term Integrated Development Plans that \nare linked to municipal responsibilities and budgets and that should reflect priorities \nidentified by communities. There have been problems related to implementation. For \nexample, those who have been around longer often exclude newcomers to an area and \ndespite initial energy during the first round both officials and community \n 17\nrepresentatives subsequently tired in what is a time-consuming exercise. 41 Even in an \nassessment of the first Integrated Development Plans, the city of Johannesburg stated \nthat \u2018incorporating residents\u2019 contributions to policy, programmes and projects is far \nfrom satisfactory\u2019. 42 Another problem with integrated development planning is that \nmunicipalities find it difficult to incorporate the multiple and often contradictory \nviews that citizens express. \n \nEarly experiences show that gender issues tended to get lost as multiple local \npriorities were aggregated upwards into a plan. For this not to happen requires \nsomething of a \u2018technical fix\u2019 in that capacity within local authorities needs to be \nraised so that officials understand the gender dimensions of local government \nresponsibilities and services and are encouraged by incentive structures that \nencourage good practice on their part. However, while the imperative of participatory \nplanning is now legally inscribed in the legislative code of local development in South \nAfrica, 43 in a country where strong central control is retained, for the technical \ndimensions of decentralisation to feed democratic decentralisation requires not only \nresponsive government but strong commitment on the part of organised civil society \nto women\u2019s involvement and impact on local development processes and outcomes.44 \nThis is difficult when civil society organisations are increasingly perceived as partners \nin the development process and consequently as responsible for sharing in the cost of \nservice delivery. Research conducted in Cato Manor in Durban45 and Greater Soweto, \nJohannesburg suggests that this cost is largely born by women in households and \ncommunities. 46\n \n \n 18\nDemocratising and Engendering Decentralisation  \nSouth Africa has two of the key ingredients for successful democratic \ndecentralisation. First, decentralisation within the context of a weak state is unlikely \nto succeed and South Africa has a strong national state and robust inter-governmental \ncoordination. Second, decentralisation works best when it encounters a vibrant and \nwell-organised civil society that can identify and engage effectively with policy \nmakers, which South Africa can also boast. Despite this, national government in \nSouth Africa is not unusual in tending to see political control as a zero-sum game, \nwith more power to the local level being equated with less for the centre. This has \nbeen exacerbated more recently by a tendency towards centralised control within the \nruling African National Congress and increasingly vociferous social movements that \nin the wake of transition have regrouped and found their confidence, voice and \nconstituencies. Trade unions such as the South African Municipal Workers Union and \nthe Anti-privatisation Forum have challenged the government\u2019s managerial and \ntechnocratic approach to decentralisation that falls short of genuine democratisation \nand stretches to the limit the resources of those who cannot afford service charges or \nwho survive without services only with difficulty.  \n \nWomen\u2019s advocacy in relation to local government in South Africa has been very \ninfluenced by debates on the politics of collective consumption.47 This has manifested \nitself in a preference for organised struggles around housing and living conditions, \ninfrastructure and services, hardly surprising given that this approach influenced \nmuch of the early gender and development literature focused on local and urban \ndevelopment more generally and reflected the real concerns of many disadvantaged \n 19\nwomen.48 This influence can be seen in early49 and more recent thinking50 about \ngender and local development in South Africa. Here, given the obviously superior \ninvestment in infrastructure and services in former white middle class areas and the \nequally obvious need to extend delivery by investing in former black townships and \ninformal settlements, it was to be expected that infrastructure and services would be a \ncritical focus in the post-apartheid era. By continuing to press for affordable housing, \nsanitation, waste collection and water and electricity connections, contemporary civic \norganisations explicitly inserted a distributive agenda into local politics, to some \neffect.51  \n \nAccording to official government statistics the proportion of households that have \naccess to clean water has increased from 60 per cent in 1996 to 85 per cent in 2001.52 \nElectricity connections over the same have period increased from 32 per cent to 70 \nper cent. Between 1994 and 2003 nearly two million housing subsidies were approved \nand almost half a million houses built in the apartheid era were transferred to their \noccupants through a discount benefit scheme. Almost half of all subsidies approved \nwere granted to women.53 Nevertheless, some local authorities have met the \nchallenges of poverty reduction and service delivery better than others and there are \nsignificant differences between rural and urban areas, as well as across different \nservices and different levels of service. Moreover, although the number of serviced \nhouseholds has increased across the board, access to some services and levels of \nservices has declined in absolute terms. This is usually in cities with the fastest \ngrowth in population and in the number of households, where municipalities have \nfound it difficult to keep pace with need.54  \n 20\n In terms of the impact on women, in its review of the first ten years of democracy the \nSouth African Government had to admit that \u2018Housing, land redistribution and other \nservices \u2026 show significant improvements in gender bias, although the majority still \ngo to male-headed households\u2019.55 Moreover, managerial decentralisation has put local \ngovernment in the unique position of what Samson calls \u2018dumping on women\u2019.56  \n \nThe implications of inadequate services for women are considerable. When a \nhousehold\u2019s services are cut off because of non-payment it is women of the household \nwho have to cope with the consequences. When services are shared in common, for \nexample communal taps or toilets, it is usually women who take responsibility for \ntheir maintenance and cleaning. Indeed, in Johannesburg it was found that struggles \nover shared services proved to be the single most important factor in propelling \npeople out of accommodation in backyard shacks in formal township houses and into \nthe more difficult physical conditions of informal settlements.57 Moreover, research in \na Durban informal settlement suggests that the importance of formal housing in well-\nserviced areas as a means towards alleviating the burden of domestic chores cannot be \nover-estimated.58  \n \nAmong the strategies for engaging local government on services have been the \ncampaigns of the Anti-Privatization Forum such as Operation Khanyisa whereby \nelectricity once disconnected is then illegally reconnected; and Operation Vulamanzi, \nwhich involved the breaking of prepaid water meters, allowing water to flow freely. \nThe Forum does not advocate illegal activities or non-payment for services but \n 21\nrecognizes them as an inevitable consequence of their members simply being unable \nto afford them. Moreover, non-payment of services is a hardy perennial within the \nrepertoire of South African collective action, dating back to the heady days of anti-\napartheid opposition in the 1980s and early 1990s. However, cut-offs of water and \nelectricity constitutes a draconian response for a democracy that prides itself on its \nhuman rights record and one that is particularly hard on women, inevitably impacting \non their role in social reproduction. A debate is ensuing currently in South Africa \nabout the extent to which cut-offs have actually been employed. However, what is \nabundantly clear is that women constitute the bulk of the membership of the Anti-\nPrivatization Forum.  \n \nFrom late 2002 the Anti-Privatization Forum saw its women members beginning to \nmeet as women and they ran a number of workshops on gender issues. However, \nalthough the commitment remains among the female membership the momentum has \nbeen difficult to sustain. According to one Forum activist interviewed in relation to \nactivities in Johannesburg, this is because \u2018we have been caught up in other things as \nan organization, and as activists have been spread very thinly\u2019. Others are less \noptimistic, arguing that the post-1994 social movements in South Africa tend to use \nwomen and have \u2018very often relied on the mobilization of women on the basis of their \npractical needs \u2013 for example, for electricity, land and housing \u2013 but have rarely \nlinked these to issues of the pernicious gender division of labour.\u201959  The major \ndifference between local organization during the apartheid era and transition and the \nsituation since is that in the earlier period there was the hope and expectation that \nwomen\u2019s involvement and organization could be scaled up and that it would amount \nto something for women. This is no longer the case as Hassim has pointed out:60\n 22\n One of the most notable changes in the landscape of the women\u2019s movement \nin the post-1994 period was the fragmentation and stratification of women\u2019s \norganizations in civil society. The political centre of the Women\u2019s National \nCoalition did not survive as the layer of the top leadership of women\u2019s \norganizations shifted into positions in the state and bureaucracy. The new \nstratifications which emerged reflected a disaggregation of the movement into \na diversity of arenas, some of which - such as those closely tied to policy \nmaking processes - were strengthened by new approaches to civil society \nwithin the state, whereas other levels reverted to the more familiar \ncommunity-based forms of organisations.  \n \nThus under apartheid women were successfully organised at the community level \naround issues important to them such as high rents and service charges but this has \nbeen less the case in what has become known as South Africa\u2019s \u2018first decade of \nfreedom\u2019. \n \nMoesoetsa confirms that women continue to be organised at community level and that \nthey are animated by issues related to service delivery. 61 She paints a bleak picture of \npoverty and unemployment driving people into the confines of the home where they \nrely only on family support and reciprocity within the confines of small and trusted \nsocial networks. However, she points to important sites of collective action, such as \nchurch groups, savings clubs and burial societies62 and argues that they have helped \nin the face of what she characterises as a crisis of representation spanning both the \npolitical sphere, for example mistrust of political parties, as well as civil society, for \n 23\nexample disappointment in trade unions that are perceived to have let people down in \nthe face of factory closures, unemployment and poverty. Under these conditions and \narising out of mutual support activities Mosoetsa observes a stirring among women in \nresponse to inadequate service delivery or affordability issues related to water supply \nand electricity. For example, a new alliance was formed in 2000 in response to the \ninstallation of water metres in the township, leading to community marches and the \ndisconnection of water metres when the metropolitan council refused their offer to \npay \u00a310 a month,63 which is what they said each household could afford. For \nMosoetsa, this engagement with metropolitan government, largely on the part of \nwomen, points to a revitalised site of organisation and emerging citizenship. \nNevertheless, women have a long way to go, not least in scaling up and asserting their \nagendas in broader organisations of civil society. \n \nOne of the arenas through which women have sought to hold government to account \nand that offered a degree of promise was through a \u2018watchdog\u2019 role in relation to \nrevenue and expenditure. Inspired by the experience of women in Australia, South \nAfrica was one of the first countries to take gender budgeting seriously and during the \n1990s the Women\u2019s Budget Initiative was established during the 1990s.64 Gender \nResponsive Budgets are mechanisms by which governments, in dialogue with other \nsectors, can integrate gender analysis into public expenditure policies and budgets. \nThis does not imply a separate budget for women but rather the political will to \ndisaggregate expenditure according to its differential impact on women and men.65 In \nSouth Africa as elsewhere, gender analysis of local government budgets is not as \nadvanced as efforts at the national level. However, in the halcyon days of gender \nbudgeting, women organising around local government issues in South Africa teamed \n 24\nup with the Women\u2019s Budget Initiative in their watchdog role.66  As Hassim has \npointed out: \n \nThe project had real possibilities to raise fundamental questions about \nspending priorities and to highlight the ways in which women were benefiting \n(or not) from particular policy approaches. However, within a few years the \nMinistry of Finance, which had initially embraced the Women\u2019s Budget \nInitiative, downgraded the project and it is now virtually moribund at the \nnational level.67\n \nShe is swift to point out that this conclusion should not be read as meaning that \nengaging the state is misguided but rather to consider how the state should be engaged \nand how to build a grassroots women\u2019s movement that is sufficiently mobilised to \nsupport a critical engagement with the state. In the meantime she stresses the \nimportance of consolidating the political gains made for women at the national level.  \n \nIf this strategy is to be paralleled at the local level then the issue of taxation is one that \nneeds to be persistently pursued, not least on the grounds that as payers of rates and \nservice charges, women have a right to make demands on local governments and to \nhold them accountable. Some progress has been made in South Africa towards raising \nawareness about the impact of local government revenue and expenditure on women. \nThis has involved informing women about local government expenditures and \nrevenues and advocating on resource allocations that promote gender equality.68 The \n 25\nfocus on local government budgets has had an interesting impact on gender budgeting \nitself, shifting the bias on expenditure towards greater concentration on how revenue \nis raised. Budlender has argued that not only are the revenue sources of local \ngovernment more diverse than for national or provincial government - including \nalongside inter-governmental transfers, property taxes, licence fees, tariffs for services \nand user charges for basic services - but also they can have a particularly adverse \naffect on women. 69  This is the case, for example with user charges, which often \nbecome women\u2019s responsibility within households. Coopoo notes in the case of South \nAfrican local government that user charges account for over half of operating budget \nincome, although as with all sources of revenue there are enormous differences \nbetween municipalities.70 If local authorities are primarily dependent on cost recovery \nas a revenue source then problems are likely to get worse rather than better for low-\nincome women.  \n \nThere are also more informal areas of local revenue collection that particularly affect \nlow-income women. In urban areas there are licences and site fees for street traders, \nwhich Skinner notes in respect of women street traders in Durban, constitute a \nsignificant proportion of most traders\u2019 incomes even if they seem low in absolute \nterms.71 Coopoo highlights the range of local taxes that poor women and men have to \npay in rural areas, including in some parts of KwaZulu-Natal where a compulsory \nlevy is paid to the king, often without understanding why or ever seeing any benefit. \nIn urban areas in South Africa, women are more likely to be seen as taxpayers and to \nsee themselves as such and here the role of civil society organisations such as the \nGender Advocacy Programme and women\u2019s initiatives such as the Women\u2019s Budget \n 26\nInitiative have been important. In rural areas the challenge is greater. Customary law \nand traditional practice has not seen women as taxpayers in their own right and efforts \non behalf of or by women to ensure that revenue streams are collected and spent \nefficiently, equitably and in gender sensitive ways proves to be that much more \ndifficult.  \n \nIn evaluating whether localisation and decentralisation are good for women, the \nevidence is mixed. Clearly, the key route for civil society participation is through the \nward committees and interestingly this is the forum that has seen considerably \nincreases in women\u2019s representation, particularly in urban areas. For example, a \nrecent study of women\u2019s involvement in local governance and development in an area \nbased development project in Cato Manor, an informal settlement in Durban, \ndemonstrates not only the importance of women in civil society organisation but also \ntheir exercise of voice on their own account: \nWomen leaders were particularly adept at negotiating this organisational \nterrain [competition for development resources within a political volatile area] \nand gained enhanced credence with the CMDA [Cato Manor Development \nAssociation responsible for development and delivery at the time]. Their \nlegitimacy among supporters derived from a long history of involvement in \nland invasions, community organisation and progressive politics. Not averse to \ncarrying weapons themselves, they were as strident as any male leader in the \narea. In the rank and file of organisational life, women were at the heart of the \ninformal networks that characterised the squatter invasions in the late 1980s \nand 1990s.72\n 27\nMoreover, through the ward committees, the integrated planning process and in \nnegotiations with the Cato Manor Development Association, women undoubtedly \ninfluenced planning outcomes in ways that spoke to their gender interests \u2013 for \nexample in the nature of public space and amenities such as the situating of parks and \nstreet lighting. This is not to say that patronage and clientalism were absent or that the \nfemale leadership represented all women. Nevertheless, women at the community \nlevel did have an impact on issues that affected their lives.  \n \nImportantly, however, the success that women had in Cato Manor would not have \nbeen possible without enabling legislation and policies at national level, which \ninfluenced and were implemented by the Cato Manor Development Association. This \nconfirms that local politics and decentralisation policies are most likely to work in the \ncontext of a strong central state and robust inter-governmental coordination and the \nsame can be said of women\u2019s politics and engendering policy and practice at the local \nlevel. That said the reach of central government in South Africa is limited. Cato \nManor is a vibrant urban settlement in a metropolitan centre that is relatively well \nresourced both financially and in human resource terms and that is closely linked to \nAfrican National Congress state and party structures. The same cannot be said of \nremote and even not so remote rural areas. It is important, therefore, to consider in \nmore detail the experience of rural local governance and decentralisation for women \nand here it is impossible to escape the role and impact of traditional authorities. \n \n \n 28\nWomen, Rural Local Governance and the Long Shadow of Tradition \nImportant in understanding rural local government is that the institutional reach of the \npost-apartheid state was limited by the legacy of apartheid policies. In its recent \npublication Towards a Ten Year Review, the South African Government stated that \n\u2018the needs of local government are most critical, with the majority of municipalities \nnot having the capacity \u2026 to perform their delivery functions\u2019.73 This points to the \nimportance of traditional authorities at the local level. Administratively they are seen \nas indispensable to developmental local government in the rural areas because under \napartheid rural local government functions in African areas lay largely in the hands of \ntraditional leaders and few alternatives are yet in place. As such they provide local \ngovernment on the cheap. Politically their perceived importance for delivering rural \nconstituencies to the African National Congress makes them difficult to alienate. \nContinuing with the status quo has meant that central government has not had to take \non traditional leaders who having amassed for themselves considerable local power \nand who have been resilient in their opposition to any local government reform that \nstood to undermine their influence. As hereditary rather than democratically elected \nleaders, government legislation insists that traditional authorities work together with \ndemocratically elected bodies within the principles of the Constitution, while \ntransforming themselves to become more democratic.  \n \nHowever, representatives of chieftaincy have shown themselves prepared to stop at \nnothing short of constitutional protection of their customary rights and \nresponsibilities.74 Between the first and second local government elections, in 1995\/6 \nand 2000 respectively, they succeeded in delaying the announcement of the election \ndate three times until they extracted an undertaking from President Thabo Mbeki to \n 29\nact on proposals to preserve their powers and functions in the new local government \nstructures.75 Mbeki did not give into their demand for 50 per cent representation on \nelected local councils because this would have irked those within the African National \nCongress and opposition parties such as the Democratic Alliance, who believed that \nhereditary leaders should not be allowed to hold a democratically elected government \nto ransom. Nevertheless, he did increase their participation in local councils from ten \nto 20 per cent, despite the implications for local democracy, as well as the tensions \nthis created between constitutional commitments towards gender equity and \ndiscrimination against women on the part of traditional structures and patterns of \ngovernance.  \n \nRepresentatives of women and traditional leaders first came into conflict during the \nconstitution-making period when some traditional leaders opposed the principle of \ngender equity. In the event the constitution validated both gender equality and cultural \nautonomy, \u2018while placing equality as the \u2018trump\u2019 criterion in cases where both came \ninto conflict\u2019.76  However, while women\u2019s organisations have continued to challenge \nchieftaincy they are often urban based and such opposition is more difficult for rural \nwomen who are customarily denied participation in traditional male-dominated \ndecision-making structures and processes. Their well-being also rests with traditional \nleaders in very material ways. Customary law, which was upheld under apartheid, \ndiscriminates against women who could not own land or property in their own right \nand who lost any such rights on the death of their husbands. This was on a principle of \nmale primogeniture that required that property be passed on to the nearest male \nrelative. The Supreme Court of Appeal upheld this principle as recently as 200077 \neven though under the new Constitution principles of gender equity are supposed to \n 30\nprevail over the exercise of customary law. Traditional authorities also control access \nto communal land, to which women have restricted access, with most traditional \nleaders continuing to refuse to allocate land to women.78\n \nThe influence of traditional leaders has most recently been seen in the passing of the \nTraditional Leadership and Governance Framework Act (TLGFA) in 2004. This Act \nvalidates the role of chieftaincy in local government and clarifies the position of \ntraditional councils that must now operate within and alongside other local \ngovernment structures. Section Three of the Act states that \u2018traditional communities\u2019 \nmust establish these councils, which in turn must comprise \u2018traditional leaders and \nmembers of the traditional community selected by the principal traditional leader \nconcerned in terms of custom\u2019. Where the old tribal authorities exist, established in \nterms of the Bantu Authorities Act of 1951, they will simply be converted into \ntraditional councils. This significantly entrenches the authority of traditional leaders \nand means in effect that legislation introduced in the 21st Century will give perpetual \nlife to a system of \u2018indirect rule\u2019 dating back to the colonial era.79  \n \nThe involvement of traditional authorities in developmental local government \nconstitutes an administrative approach to decentralisation, albeit one that has the \nadded advantage of no alienating potential political opponents. For example, being \nadded to existing traditional councils and tribal courts are new government sponsored \ntraditional development centres, dubbed \u2018traditional\u2019 because they are set up under the \naegis of local chieftaincies and in coordination with traditional structures of \ngovernance. Some of these are already underway and are functioning as one-stop \nshops, serving as pension payout points, satellite offices for the Department of Home \n 31\nAffairs, sites for mobile clinics, providers of HIV\/AIDS awareness services and small \nbusiness development advice. At the launch of the Mpumuza Traditional \nDevelopment Centre, in KwaZulu-Natal the Provincial Traditional Affairs Member of \nthe Executive Committee Inkosi Nyanga Ngubane said that the traditional \ndevelopment centres represented a shift in the way traditional communities related to \nlocal government and a transformation of local governance structures so that they \nwere \u2018more accessible to a greater number of people in the traditional authority \nareas\u2019.80  \n \nWhile taking information, communication and services to people in deep rural areas is \nundoubtedly a good thing and of potential benefit to women, it is ironic that primarily \nmale non-elected appointees dominate the level of government closest to the people. \nIndeed, the elevation of hereditary chieftainship to a privileged and protected position \nwithin local governance seriously compromises rural women\u2019s access to and influence \non local government. In the name of modernising if not democratising traditional \nstructures, the Traditional Leadership Act insists that one third of the \u2018traditional \ncommunity\u2019 must be women and that of this one third, 25 per cent have to be elected \nby the community. However, this is in a context where 40 per cent of council \nmembers are elected, the remaining 60 per cent comprising traditional leaders and \nmembers of the traditional community selected by elders in terms of custom.81 The \nAct states that all traditional councils must adhere to this within the space of four \nyears but there are no clear provisions or safeguards as to how women should be \nelected and no sanctions if there is a failure to comply.  \n \n 32\nNowhere has government failed women more than in relation to land and women\u2019s \nrights over its allocation and use. Initially it was proposed that land remain a national \ngovernment competence and did not devolve to local government, although \nlegislation would cater for a variety of different forms of land and property rights. \nTraditional leaders ferociously opposed this and the proposed legislation was shelved \nuntil after the 1999 elections when in April 2001 the new Minister of Land Affairs, \nThoko Didiza, announced the introduction of a land rights bill. The bill emphasised \ncommunities rather than individuals and reinforced the power of traditional leaders.  \nThe Communal Land Rights Act was finally passed in late 2003, stating that land \nadministration functions and powers \u2013 including the power to own, administer \nallocate and register land rights \u2013 must be performed by \u2018traditional councils\u2019 where \nthey exist (Section 22(2)). The Communal Land Rights Act needs to be viewed in \nconjunction with the Traditional Leadership and Governance Framework Act, which \nwent through parliament at the same time, immediately preceding the April 2004 \nnational elections. Clearly winning over traditional leaders was perceived as a greater \npolitical imperative than upholding the liberal democratic principles of the \nConstitution. \n \nThis legislation was dogged by controversy and was opposed, not least by women\u2019s \norganisations. Given the inevitable negative impact on women of these two Acts in \ncombination, there may be some weight to the argument that the joint effect of the \nbills is anti-constitutional. Despite speculation that women\u2019s organisations may take \nthe government to the Constitutional Court on this issue, this has not yet materialised. \nRural women were consulted by organisations involved in land issues such as the \n 33\nProgramme for Land and Agricultural Studies and their views and position \nrepresented and the Commission on Gender Equality also highlighted women\u2019s \nconcerns. However, they are not been well organised beyond the community level. In \nterms of civil society organisations, historically the Rural Women\u2019s Movement helped \nensure that distributive issues such as access to and control over land have been kept \nat the forefront of rural women\u2019s political agenda, for example in relation to the \nconstitution-making process. However, as Hassim has argued, \u2018by the time the \nTraditional Leadership and Governance Framework and Communal Land Rights bills \nwere introduced, the Rural Women\u2019s Movement was a virtually defunct \norganisation\u2019.82 Ultimately women\u2019s influence in this arena has been scant and the \nissue of women\u2019s land rights remains unresolved.83  \n \nThe situation of rural women stands in stark contrast to the scenario of local \ngovernment envisaged by the Gender Advocacy Programme in its commentary on the \nWhite Paper on Local Government:  \nLocal Government is the level of government closest to the people. It has \nparticular importance for women, because of its responsibility for the delivery \nof goods and services that impact directly on the necessities of social \nreproduction, a sphere in which women have disproportionate responsibility. \nIts direct interface with the community puts Local Government in a unique \nposition to understand the contextual dynamics that shape and regulate \nwomen\u2019s lives. Through its location Local Government has the potential to \ncontribute to greater gender equity.84\n 34\nOn the contrary, to the insult of a desultory performance in ensuring rural women\u2019s \nrepresentation in local government has been added the injury of reducing their \ninfluence on the institutions that stand between them and access to critical resources \nsuch as land. Women\u2019s access to resources remains elusive and is prevented above all \nby that level of government that is \u2018closest to the people\u2019. \n \nConclusions \n \nLocal government is the tier of government closest to civil society and as such really \ndoes hold opportunities for locally organised women. However, the co-location of \ngovernment and civil society organisations at the local level can lead to ambiguous \noutcomes, with access to resources and decision-making being retained by existing \npower holders at the expense of the advancement of women\u2019s participation. In South \nAfrica, the intersection of the formal organisations of local government with socially \nembedded institutions, such as patterns of male dominance in collective action and \ncustomary practices by traditional authorities, have a negative impact on women\u2019s \nprospects for democracy. Worse, these informal institutions appear to becoming \nincreasingly entrenched in the formal organisation of local government and in law. \nThis stands to undermine the hard-won rights of citizens and especially women who \nare prejudiced by practices and procedures of local governance in all quarters and \nnow additionally by legislation. The extent to which local government and \ndecentralisation are embedded in asymmetrical social relations and informal \ninstitutional practice, helps explain why local governance rarely proves to be a magic \nbullet for increasing women\u2019s access to and presence in government as well as their \n 35\ninfluence over it. Efforts towards the institutionalisation of gender in South Africa \nwere made at the same time as the impact of neo-liberal policies was deepening in \nSouth Africa. The extension of services to historically disadvantaged populations \ncame with a price tag in the form of cost recovery and women especially have acutely \nfelt its social impact. It is at local level that the carbuncles of any political system are \nmost apparent and in South Africa it is women who feel them most painfully.  \n \nSouth African women so far do not have as secure a footing in local government \nstructures as in other tiers of government. It could be argued that the vacuum left by \nthe movement of a substantial number of women\u2019s leaders into national and \nprovincial government since 1994 has been necessary and indeed, there have been \nconsiderable pay-offs from this participation in terms of enabling legislation and \npolicies. However, this now needs to mature into greater congruence between higher \nand lower spheres of government. Moreover, it is also at the local level that women \ncan often organise most effectively. Their involvement in movements opposed to \nprivatisation and cost recovery in service delivery is testimony to this. What appears \nto be missing is the space, ability or leadership for women to organise against \ndecentralisation policies where they adversely affect their gender interests. Structures \nand processes do exist and can be taken advantage of by women\u2019s and gendered \norganisations wishing to work alongside or with local government and these are \nconstitutionally protected. Women taking effective advantage of these opportunities \nappear a long way off.  \n \n 36\nIn sum, engendering democratic decentralisation on a number of factors, not least the \nnature of macro-economic policy in South Africa and how this articulates with issues \nof access and affordability, which affect all low-income people but particularly \nwomen and notably rural women. In part it depends on whether central government \nand the African National Congress with its resounding majority following the 2004 \nnational elections, remains open and responsive to challenge from civil society and \nwhether civil society in turn is able to represent women and promote gender justice. \nAt present, Manor\u2019s assessment in relation to India that decentralisation \u2018offers only \nmodest encouragement\u2019 to women appears as much the case for South Africa.85 As \nsuch, decentralisation and local government remain a real litmus test of South \nAfrica\u2019s ability to engender its new democracy.  \n 37\n  \n \n                                                 \n1 Diana Conyers, \u201cDecentralization: The Latest Fashion in Development \nAdministration?\u201d Public Administration and Development 3, (1983): 97-109.  \n \n2 Richard Crook and James Manor, \u201cDemocratic Decentralization,\u201d Operations \nEvaluation Department Working Paper (Washington D.C.: World Bank, June 2000). \n \n3 Dennis Rondinelli, Shabir  Cheema and John R.
