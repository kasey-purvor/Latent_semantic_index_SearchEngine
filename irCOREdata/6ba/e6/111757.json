Von Braun (2007) highlighted the\ntransforming role of the interacting driving forces of popula-\ntion increase, income growth, urbanization, and globalization\non food production, markets, and consumption. To these\nforces can be added the twin elements of climate variability\nand climate change which have direct effects on both food\nproduction and food security (Parry et al., 2004). It is well\nknown that the sensitivity of agricultural systems to climate\ndiffers between systems depending on whether they are\ntemperature- or water-limited, and whether they are operating\nnear their optimum or not. Fuhrer (2006) concluded that there\nwas ample evidence to demonstrate the sensitivity of agricul-\ntural systems to climate change, and that the range of effects\non potential productivity was from extremely negative in areas\nthat were already water-limited to positive in areas that were\ntemperature-limited. Similarly, the effects of climate variability\nand change on food security are also location-specific and,\nmore importantly, societally-specific with countries and groups\nwith low income and limited adaptive capacity facing\nsignificant threats to food security (von Braun, 2007). In\nparticular, food insecurity in Sub-Saharan Africa will be\nincreased by climate change although the size of the effect is\naffected more by socio-economic factors than by climate\nchange per se (Easterling et al., 2007).\n* To whom correspondence should be addressed: E-mail: peter.gregory@scri.ac.uk\n\u00aa The Author [2009].

(2005) demonstrated that climate variation\nis only one of several interacting factors that affect food\nsecurity. In studies of household food security in southern\nAfrica, Misselhorn (2005) found that climate\/environment\nwas only one of some 33 drivers mentioned in surveys as\nimportant by householders, so that in all communities many\ninteracting factors resulted in vulnerability to food shortages.\nHowever, climate\/environment was one of the seven most\nfrequently cited factors influencing food security, because of\nits role both as an ongoing issue (57% of cases where it was\nmentioned) and as a \u2018shock\u2019 (43%; Scholes and Biggs, 2004).\nThe effects of sudden shocks such as drought are felt, then,\non top of other ongoing, long-term stresses. The result is that\nthe long-term stresses deplete household resilience so that the\nemployment of coping strategies that might be available to\nother better-prepared communities to deal with sudden\nshocks, is at too high a cost or, simply, unavailable. For\nexample, reliance on purchased food typically increases in\ndrought years due to losses in food production leading to an\nincrease in poverty due to the synergistic action of other\ndrivers such as rising food prices and unemployment. Scholes\nand Biggs (2004) noted that the food security crisis in\nsouthern Africa in 2002\u20132003 was not simply a result of\ndrought alone and, indeed, climatic stress was not as severe\nas in many previous years. Maize production during the\npreceding growing season was only 5.5% less than\nthe previous 5-year average so food stocks at the start of the\nclimatic shock were not unusually low. However, a range of\nregional and global political and economic factors including\nhigh food prices, legacies of structural adjustment, govern-\nment policies, conflict, and war, policies on genetically-\nmodified foods, and poor responses to the HIV\/AIDS\npandemic (Vogel and Smith, 2002) reduced the resilience of\nthe communities to cope with the shock of drought. The\nmoderate climatic shock intensified food insecurity and the\nlong-term vulnerability of the region.\nWhile many agricultural systems are a mix of crop,\npasture, tree, and animal production, this paper focuses on\ncrops. Ingram et al. (2008) outlined three major challenges\nfor agronomic research in the climate\/food security debate:\n(i) to understand better how climate change will affect\ncropping systems (as opposed to crop productivity); (ii) to\nassess technical and policy options for reducing the\ndeleterious impacts of climate change on cropping systems\nwhile minimizing further environmental degradation; and\n(iii) to understand how best to address the information\nneeds of policy-makers and report and communicate\nagronomic research results in a manner that will assist the\ndevelopment of food systems adapted to climate change. In\naddition, to contribute effectively to the food security\/\nclimate change debate, the agricultural research community\nshould think more about the issues of scale and how to\ntranslate findings at plot-scale over a few seasons to larger\nspatial and temporal scales and to the issues of food\nsecurity.\nMany assessments of climate change effects on crops have\nfocused on potential yields, but factors such as pests and\npathogens have major effects in determining actual yields\n(Gregory et al., 1999). This paper reviews the direct effects\nof climate on crop growth and yield and the evidence that\nexisting change or variation has affected production. The\neffects of climate on plant pests and pathogens and the\ninteractions that may occur between crops, pests, and\npathogens under changed climate are also reviewed. Finally,\nthe contribution that better understanding of the roles of\npests and diseases in crop production systems might make\nto enhanced food security in changed climates is considered.\nClimate, crop growth, and yield\nCurrent research suggests that while many crops may\nrespond positively to increased atmospheric CO2 concen-\ntrations in the absence of climate changes (Long et al.,\n2004), the associated effects of higher temperatures and\naltered patterns of precipitation will probably combine to\nreduce yields (Easterling et al., 2007). Estimates of the CO2\nfertilization effect vary depending on which experimental\napproach is used (Long et al., 2006; Tubiello et al., 2007a;\nZiska and Bunce, 2007; Ainsworth et al., 2008), but current\nestimates for increases in crop yield are 10\u201320% for C3\ncrops and 0\u201310% for C4 crops (Ainsworth and Long, 2005).\nHowever, it is widely recognized that these figures are likely\nto represent an overestimate in actual field and farm level\nresponses because they are derived from experiments and\ncrop models that do not necessarily take limiting factors\nsuch as pests and pathogens, competition, nutrient compe-\ntition, and soil water fully into account (Gregory et al.,\n1999; Tubiello et al., 2007b).\nBecause of the fundamental effects of radiation, temper-\nature, and water on the growth of plants (Hay and Porter,\n2006), it is unsurprising that there has been considerable\nresearch to understand the effects of climate and climate\nchange on crop production. Gregory et al. (1999) summa-\nrized experimental findings on wheat and rice crops that\nindicated decreased crop duration (and hence yield) of\nwheat as a consequence of warming, and reductions in\nyields of rice of about 5% per \u0001C rise above 32 \u0001C.\nSimilarly, simulations of maize production in Africa and\nLatin America using climate data from the Hadley Climate\nModel 2 to generate characteristic daily weather data for\n2055 predicted an overall reduction of 10%, although there\n2828 | Gregory et al.\n at O\nxford Journals on February 3, 2012\nhttp:\/\/jxb.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nwas considerable variability within and between countries\nwith some areas benefitting from changed climate (Jones and\nThornton, 2003). The likelihood of some regions benefitting\nfrom changed climate while others suffer has been high-\nlighted by a number of modelling exercises that combine\nbiophysically based crop models with global simulations of\nclimate. For example, Fischer et al. (2001) modelled the\nglobal variation in effects of climate change anticipated in\n2050 on potential yields of rainfed cereal crops and\ndemonstrated that cereal-producing regions of Canada, and\nnorthern Europe and Russia might be expected to increase\nproduction, while many parts of the world would suffer\nlosses, including the western edge of the USA prairies,\neastern Brazil, Western Australia, and many, though not all,\nparts of Africa. Overall, the results of this and subsequent\nwork demonstrated that climate change would benefit the\ncereal production of developed countries more than the\ndeveloping countries, even if cropping practices evolved to\nallow more than one rainfed crop per year (Fischer et al.,\n2002, 2005). They concluded that production losses in some\n40 poor, developing countries (mainly in Sub-Saharan\nAfrica) with a combined population of 2 billion, including\n450 million undernourished people, may drastically increase\nthe number of those undernourished.\nWhile model predictions of crop responses to projected\nclimate changes are numerous, relatively few assessments\nhave been made of the effects of the measured changes in\nclimate that have already occurred in the last 50 years or so,\na period in which the global mean air temperature has\nincreased by 0.13 \u0001C per decade (IPCC, 2007). Gregory and\nIngram (2008) show that the majority of such assessments\nhave been made on temperate cereals grown in northern\nmid-latitudes with very little information available for crops\nin the tropics. Although the results were variable, there were\nsome common features including (i) a measured increase in\nmean temperature at many locations across the globe of\nabout 1.0\u20131.4 \u0001C over the last 30\u201340 years often with\na larger change in minimum than maximum temperatures\nbut with no detected trend in precipitation; (ii) warmer\ntemperatures have resulted in phenological change and\nthere is some evidence for changes to disease incidence and\nto farming practices; (iii) the effects of changed temper-\natures (not all were warmer) on crops is complex because\ndifferent species have different base and optimum temper-\natures for development, some processes are daytime only\n(e.g. photosynthesis) while others occur throughout the day\n(e.g. respiration), and many processes are non-linearly\nrelated to temperature; (iv) typically, the climate effects\nwere small relative to the increased yields resulting from\ntechnological improvements, but they can be regionally\nsignificant; and (v) use of crop models combined with\nclimatic data suggests that, for vegetative crops grown in\nareas where higher temperatures permit earlier sowing and\nhence increased duration of green leaf area, crop yields may\nhave increased. No such effects were found for crops such\nas wheat which forms a distinct reproductive structure\nbecause while warming may advance flowering, it reduces\nthe period of grain filling and thereby does not benefit yield.\nClimate and crop pests\nCO2 effects\nFew studies addressing the impacts of climate change on crop\nyield have incorporated the effects of crop pests. For example,\nwhen reviewing how elevated [CO2] might affect crop yields,\nZiska and Bunce (2007) listed only two papers that\nconsidered how insect pests might modify the predictions.\nThis is despite the wealth of studies that address the impacts\nof climate change variables on insect pests using growth\nchambers, open-top chambers and free air carbon dioxide\nenrichment (FACE) approaches (see reviews by Bezemer and\nJones, 1998; Bale et al., 2002). Most studies continue to\naddress the responses of crop pests to separate variables\n(usually elevated [CO2] or temperature), but some studies\nhave illustrated the importance of combining climatic\nvariables for more realistic climate change scenarios (Zvereva\nand Kozlov, 2006). For example, Newman (2004) presented\na model for cereal aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi) dynamics\nunder elevated CO2 concentrations and warmer temper-\natures, and demonstrated that, while under optimal condi-\ntions elevated CO2 was likely to promote aphid populations,\nthis effect was negated by predicted increases in temperature.\nHowever, even though R. padi did not become more\nprevalent under simultaneously elevated CO2 and tempera-\nture, Newman (2004) pointed out that the 10% earlier timing\nof population peaks and the 10% increase in winged forms\ncould result in greater spread and incidence of barley yellow\ndwarf virus for which this aphid is a vector.\nWhile crop biomass is predicted to increase in response to\nelevated CO2 concentrations under many circumstances, it\nis also recognized that crops and soils may subsequently\nbecome nutrient limited, especially in terms of nitrogen\navailability (Diaz et al., 1993). The increased use of legumes\nwithin arable rotations has therefore been of considerable\ninterest (Tubiello et al., 2007b) since legumes can increase\nN2 fixation in response to elevated CO2 (Soussana and\nHartwig, 1996). However, soil-dwelling Sitona spp. weevil\nlarvae are known to target legume root nodules (which\nhouse the N2-fixing bacteria) which potentially reduces N2\nfixation in the plant (Murray et al., 1996). Recent findings\nsuggest that elevated CO2 promotes Sitona spp. larvae\n(Staley and Johnson, 2008). In this example, root nodules\nof white clover (Trifolium repens) became both more\nnumerous and larger in size, which was accompanied by\nlarger populations of Sitona lepidus larvae that developed at\na much faster rate (Table 1). More root nodules were\ndamaged as a consequence and nitrogen concentrations in\nthe roots declined (Table 1). Any accompanying increase in\nsuch pests could therefore compromise the perceived\nbenefits of legumes in arable rotations under future climate\nscenarios.\nTemperature effects\nIn addition to empirical studies and models of effects of\nclimate change variables on crop pests, extrapolations based\non responses of crop pests to recent changes in climate\nClimate change, pests and pathogens | 2829\n at O\nxford Journals on February 3, 2012\nhttp:\/\/jxb.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n(referred to as climate change fingerprinting) have also been\nattempted (Scherm, 2004). One of the most detailed examples\nof this approach is the use of historical flight phenology\nrecords of aphids in the UK (Fleming and Tatchell, 1995).\nThese have shown reduced overwintering mortality of some\naphids due to increasing temperatures, resulting in flight\nphenologies occurring as much as a month earlier (Zhou\net al., 1995). Like the models presented by Newman (2004),\nthese fingerprint studies suggest that climate change is likely\nto increase the spread of plant pathogens spread by aphid\nvectors in a number of crops (Harrington et al., 2007) which\ncould ultimately reduce yields. Again in the UK, warmer\nwinters have already resulted in aphids being detected in\nsuction traps in Scotland several weeks earlier than pre-\nviously, and the aphid populations themselves, previously of\na few clonal genotypes, are becoming much more variable\n(Malloch et al., 2006). The current Scottish Seed Potato\nindustry is dependent on the virus-free status of its crops\nwhich has historically been sustained through the absence of\nthe aphid vectors early in the season; this status is increasingly\nunder threat.\nRainfall\nRainfall can have substantial effects on insect populations. For\nexample, Staley et al. (2007) investigated the impacts of\nenhanced summer rainfall and drought conditions on soil-\ndwelling Agriotes lineatus (wireworms) in grassland plots.\nWireworms are damaging pests of crops such as potatoes,\nespecially when planted on land taken out of grass (Johnson\net al., 2008) and there is speculation that they are likely to\nbecome more of a problem as a result of climate change\n(Parker and Howard, 2001). Staley et al. (2007) found that\nthere was a rapid increase in the population of wireworms in\nthe upper soil as a consequence of enhanced summer rainfall\nevents compared to ambient and drought conditions (Fig. 1).\nIn Sub-Saharan Africa, there is already increasing evidence\nthat changes in rainfall patterns are driving migratory\npatterns of the desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria), which\ndevastates crops in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia (Cheke\nand Tratalos, 2007). Hulme et al. (2001) suggest that pre-\ncipitation patterns in Southern Africa are likely to decrease in\nDecember\u2013February, but increase in June\u2013August when this\nwill most benefit S. gregaria and lead to further problems.\nCrop\u2013pest interactions\nWhile many observations of insect responses to elevated CO2\nand temperature have been made in natural ecosystems,\na feature of insect herbivores in agro-ecosystems is that crops\nTable 1.

This may involve traits that directly deter or\ninhibit herbivory, or traits that result in the production of\ncompounds that recruit antagonists of the pest. There are\nnow several examples of climate change compromising such\ncrop resistance to pests. In soyabean, elevated CO2 caused\na down-regulation of genes that produce cysteine proteinase\ninhibitors, which are specific deterrents to coleopteran\nherbivores (Zavala et al., 2008). This resulted in increased\ncrop susceptibility to western corn rootworm (Diabrotica\nvirgifera virgifera) and Japanese beetle (Popilla japonica),\nboth of which have significant impacts on yields. Indirect\nresistance (e.g. recruitment of pest antagonists) can also be\naffected by climate change. For example, elevated CO2\naltered the production of volatile defence compounds in\nwhite cabbage (Brassica oleracea) responsible for recruiting\nnatural enemies (Cotesia plutellae) of the diamond back\nmoth (Plutella xylostella), resulting in lower searching\nefficacy of C. plutellae (Vuorinen et al., 2004).\nElevated CO2 and temperature can affect the production\nof plant secondary compounds with pharmacological im-\npacts on crop\u2013pest interactions. For example, Ziska et al.\n(2008a) found that elevated CO2 increased concentrations\nof nicotine in tobacco and scopolamine in jimson weed\n(Datura stramonium L.), but had no effect on atropine\nconcentration in tobacco. Because growth was enhanced in\nboth plant species, the amount of all three secondary\ncompounds was increased on a per plant basis. Likewise\nelevated CO2 increased production per plant of morphine,\ncodeine, papaverine, and noscapine in wild poppy (Papaver\nsetigerum; Ziska et al., 2008b). The consequences for\nherbivory were not determined.\nClimate and crop pathogens\nThere are several reports of changes in disease incidence or\nseverity in response to components of climate change,\nalthough their usefulness is limited because the experiments\nnormally involved only single parameters and thus do not\nfully capture the possible change scenarios. Furthermore,\nmost environmental variables will affect both host and\npathogen, and affect them in different ways through different\nmechanisms. Also, in crop stands, there are further complex\ninteractions that are not captured in controlled environment\nchambers. Consequently, most studies to date only provide\nsome indicative trends which mainly serve to highlight where\nmore resilience needs to be built into the system. Nevertheless,\nthere are reports of some diseases occurring earlier in the\ngrowing season as a consequence of warming. For example,\nthe number of days after planting when the first outbreak of\nlate blight occurs in Finland, decreased progressively over\na decade in the 1990s (Hannukkala et al., 2007; Fig. 2).\nCO2 effects\nWhile elevated CO2 has direct effects on plant growth, it\ncan also result in indirect effects such as reduced expression\nof induced resistance (Pangga et al., 2004). Elevated levels\nof both ozone and CO2 can also affect expression of\nresistance more directly (Plazek et al., 2001; Plessl et al.,\n2005). There can also be direct effects on pathogen growth,\nfor example, the enhanced growth of Colletotrichum\ngloeosporioides infecting Stylosanthes scabra at high CO2\n(Chakraborty and Datta, 2003). Pathogen-specific effects\nare common, and different stages of infection can be\naffected differentially with the cumulative effects resulting\nin the observed disease (Hibberd et al., 1996). However,\nperhaps as important as both the direct and indirect effects\nof CO2 on pathogen growth and subsequent disease is the\neffect on pathogen fecundity, which has been shown to\nincrease under elevated CO2 levels leading to enhanced rates\nof pathogen evolution (Chakraborty and Datta, 2003).\nElevated ozone can have a similar range of effects (such as\na 3\u20135-fold increase in rust infection on poplar), but this\nresponse is reduced by elevated CO2 (Karnosky et al., 2002).\nOverall, the effects of elevated CO2 concentration on\nplant disease can be positive or negative, although in\na majority of the examples reviewed by Chakraborty et al.\n(2000), disease severity increased. Similarly, the effects of\nozone and other abiotic stresses can be in either direction\nand the effects of many stresses are interactive, so it is not\npossible to generalize.\nTemperature and drought effects\nDisease resistance can be differentially affected by temper-\nature. For example, cultivars of wheat on the UK Recom-\nmended List (HGCA, 2003, www.hgca.com) were routinely\ntested against isolates of brown rust (leaf rust) (Puccinia\nFig. 2.

Generally about\nhalf showed differential resistance expression, either effec-\ntive at 10 \u0001C and not at 25 \u0001C or vice versa (Jones, 2003).\nBrowder and Eversmeyer (1986) also reported similar\ndifferential temperature responses in the same host\u2013patho-\ngen system, and both groups also demonstrated that the\neffect was not necessarily attributable simply to resistance\ngene expression as isolates showed differential responses\ntoo. Similar temperature sensitivities have been reported\npreviously to the same rust (Dyck and Johnson, 1983), to\nPuccinia striiformis (Gerechter-Amitai et al., 1984), and to\nPuccinia tritici in oats (Martens et al., 1967). Expression of\nresistance to broomrape in sunflower (Eizenberg et al.,\n2003), black shank resistance in tobacco (Sanden and\nMoore, 1978) and rice resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae\npv. oryzae (Webb et al. in Garrett et al., 2006) provide other\nexamples of temperature sensitivity.\nUnder drought stress, pathogens can have reduced im-\npact or symptoms (Huber and Gillespie, 1992; Pennypacker\net al., 1991), but resistance expression can also be reduced\n(Christiansen and Lewis, 1982). Resistance genes can also\nshow temporary loss of expression due to stress or stress\nrelief. For example, the sudden relief of drought stress\nresulted in a loss of effectiveness of the mlo resistance gene\nagainst powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f.sp. hordei) in\nbarley (Newton and Young, 1996). This was probably not\nspecific to the mlo gene but rather to the speed of resistance\ngene response which is critical for the efficacy of mlo gene\nexpression. A possible mechanism for the changed levels of\nresistance is that enhanced levels of free radicals were found\nunder drought-stressed conditions in the barley genotype\nwhich expressed most loss of resistance, whereas other\ngenotypes did not differ significantly (Goodman and Newton,\n2005). Stress-related and defence-related gene expression\nwere shown to be compromised in stress-relieved barley\nplants compared with non-stressed plants (Barker, 1998) with\nthe differences in accumulation of defence gene transcripts\ncorrelated with levels of resistance breakdown in different\nbarley genotypes (Stewart, 2002). The same breakdown\nproblem occurred in response to sudden relief of cold stress\nbut not salt stress (Stewart, 2002). Together, these findings\nsuggest that the efficacy of current resistance genes may be\ncompromised under more extreme and variable climatic\nconditions.\nCrop\u2013pathogen interactions\nMany pathogens exhibit so much capacity for generating,\nrecombining, and selecting fit combinations of variants in\nkey pathogenicity, fitness, and aggressiveness traits that\nthere is little doubt that any new opportunities which result\nfrom crop responses to climate change will be exploited by\nthem. However, there is also evidence that, under stressed\nconditions, some organisms enhance their ability to gener-\nate variants. For example, stress can stimulate the activity\nof retrotransposons thereby enhancing the generation of\nvariability in pathogens such as Fusarium oxysporum\n(Anaya and Roncero, 1996). Similarly, in the Dutch elm\ndisease fungi, Ophiostoma ulmi and Ophiostoma nono-ulmi,\nthe mobility of its transposons is activated by stress (Bouvet\net al., 2008). Organisms have genes which regulate such\ntransposon activity in response to particular stress factors\n(Twiss et al., 2005).\nThere is evidence for adaptive mutation and amplification\nas routes for inducible genetic instability which allow more\nrapid evolution under stress and an escape from growth\ninhibition (Hastings et al., 2000). Enhanced mutation rate is\nspecifically related to an increased background of reactive\noxygen species characteristically produced in stress re-\nsponses (Blanco et al., 1995). Fungal pathogens such as\nPhaeosphera nodorum and Phytophthora infestans have been\nobserved to generate very high levels of variability and\nNewton (1988) suggested that the mechanisms described\nfacilitated mutant instability as a means of generating\nenhanced levels of variation for adaptation without disad-\nvantageous mutation load (Newton, 1988). In higher plants,\nalternate splicing of mRNA is another mechanism which\ncan give different gene products in response to stress,\nand stresses such as pathogen infection can induce this\n(Halterman et al., 2003). Alternative intron processing has\nalso been reported in the pathogens themselves, such as in\nthe Oomycetes Phytophthora species (Costanzo et al., 2007)\nand true fungi such as Ustilago maydis (Ho et al., 2007).\nClearly these and other post-translational regulatory mech-\nanisms may contribute to adaptive response to climate. In\nthese ways enhanced genome plasticity can be achieved for\nresponse to environmental changes affecting gene expres-\nsion levels and achieving ectopic recombination\u2014changes\nwhich can later become fixed through conventional muta-\ntion and recombination.\nMost models used to investigate the probable changes in\npathogen prevalence are relatively simple and frequently\nemploy climate-matching approaches. Others improve pre-\ndictions by combining climate change models with other\nmodels such as a weather-based disease forecasting models.\nThis approach, used to simulate the effects of climate\nchange on Phoma stem canker on oilseed rape, has been\nmodelled with respect to both its severity and spread over\nthe next 10\u201320 years. The results clearly indicate not only\nincreased severity across its existing range, but also rapid\nprogress into more northern areas where the crop is largely\ndisease-free at present (Evans et al., 2008). Another example\nof this type of model is the increased range of stem rust,\nand, in particular, the race known as Ug99 which has\nvirulence towards the Sr31 resistance gene (1B\/1R trans-\nlocation) which is used extensively in wheat varieties across\nthe world (Admassu et al., 2009). Barley is generally\nsusceptible to Ug99 but hitherto not generally exposed to\nsuitable climatic conditions. About 30 wild barley acces-\nsions have already been identified in a screen for effective\nresistance (B Steffenson, personal communication). There\nare several other examples where the distribution ranges of\npathogens have been shown to change in response to\nclimatic variables such as, for example, Puccinia striiformis\nf.sp. tritici in response to rainfall patterns in South Africa\n2832 | Gregory et al.\n at O\nxford Journals on February 3, 2012\nhttp:\/\/jxb.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n(Boshoff et al., 2002). Similarly, the northward extension of\nthe range of needle blight (Dothistroma septosporum) is\nattributed to climate warming (Woods et al., 2005).\nWhile such models are useful indicators of potential new\ndiseases in hitherto disease-free areas, the effects of\ncovariates and the details of complex interactions at other\ntrophic levels are usually absent. For example, although\npopulations of aphids may increase on cotton, the response\nof predators, such as wasps, is unknown (Zamani et al.,\n2006). Similarly, while a combination of heat and drought\nmay reduce the population of cereal aphids in southern\nBritain, if aphid predators are affected to an even greater\ndegree, then the predicted reduction in aphids may be\nnegated (Newman, 2005). Changes in crop rotations in\nresponse to climate change may also influence the future\nimportance of specific pathogens. For example, if warming\nof northern latitudes enables forage maize to be grown in\nthe rotation then this will leave residues in which pathogens\nsuch as Fusarium Head Blight (FHB) could build up high\nlevels of inoculum for subsequent wheat and barley crops\n(Maiorano et al., 2008). Changes in land use will have many\nsuch implications for climate change (Dale, 1997). Effective\ndeployment of crop diversity across all scales, from in-\ndividual plant interactions to regions, results in the reduced\nprogress of crop epidemics, improved resource utilization,\nand the enhanced stability of yield and quality. These, in\nturn, combine to enhance crop resilience to the effects of\nclimatic stress, and stresses in general, thereby improving\ncrop performance (Newton et al., 2009).\nExtreme events and crop pests and\npathogens\nExtreme events may become more frequent in the future,\nincreasing the risks to crop yields. However, this is not\nalways so and the consequence for yield is often dependent\non the particular scenario that is considered (Porter and\nSemenov, 2005). Two main types of extreme events can be\ncharacterized either as (i) exceeding normal maxima or\nminima parameter ranges by a rare magnitude, or (ii)\nmaintaining a normal maxima or minima for an unusually\nlong duration. Events which do not normally occur in\na region such as violent storms or floods can be included in\nthese categories. Extreme parameters can include tempera-\nture (including lack of, or occurrence of, unseasonal\nfrosts), precipitation (including snow, hail or extreme in-\ntensity), wind, light (e.g. lack of intensity due to cloud or\ndust), humidity, or any unusual sequences of such extremes\nor even unusual combinations, none of which is extreme on\nits own. The effect of extremes is illustrated by events in the\nsummer of 2003 in parts of Europe, where temperatures\nwere 6 \u0001C warmer than long-term means and precipitation\ndeficits of up to 300 mm were recorded (Tubiello et al.,\n2007b). As a consequence, parts of the EU such as the Po\nvalley in Italy, reported record reductions in maize yield of\n36% (Ciais et al., 2005). For the EU as a whole, uninsured\nlosses were estimated at 13 billion Euros for 2003 (Se\u00b4nat,\n2004; Tubiello et al., 2007b). In many respects, rapid\nchanges in the climate caused by extreme events are likely\nto be more devastating for crop production if they lead to\nsudden pest outbreaks and disease epidemics because\ncontrol measures are difficult to apply quickly enough or\non a sufficiently large scale to contain the problem.\nWhen addressing how climate change will affect pests,\nexperimentalists have conventionally focused on long-term\nclimate changes such as elevated global CO2 concentration\nand air temperatures (reviewed above) but there are several\nexamples of extreme events having impacts on pest incidence\nin the shorter term (see Collier et al., 2008). Historically,\nthere are also many examples of invertebrate food webs\nresponding to short-term changes in climatic conditions. For\nexample, conditions in the UK in 1975 and 1976 were\nparticularly beneficial for aphids in terms of early develop-\nment and reduced overwintering mortality, leading to large\nincreases in aphid populations, including the cereal aphids\nSitobion avenae and Metopolophium dirhodum (Jones, 1979).\nThis caused an explosion in populations of predatory\nladybirds (Adalia spp.) which fed on the abundant prey in\nearly spring and developed to adult stage rapidly (Majerus\nand Kearns, 1989). Indeed, populations became so abundant\nthat there were widespread reports of ladybirds biting\nhumans when they had exhausted supplies of their aphid\nprey (Majerus and Kearns, 1989).\nExtreme events can also have indirect or secondary\nconsequences as illustrated by outbreaks of potato late-\nblight in Canada. The epidemics in 1994 to 1996 were due\nto genotypes of Phytophthora infestans from distant regions\nwhich were associated with the unusual tropical storm\ntracks moving up the eastern seaboard of the USA (Peters\net al., 1999). In the UK, the unusually wet season of 2007,\ncoinciding with the prevalence of epidemiologically-fit new\npathotypes of P. infestans, resulted in an unprecedented\nnumber of outbreaks of late-blight (www.eucablight.org).\nThis was also reflected in the number of isolates and their\ngenotypes (Fig. 3).\nCrops, pests and diseases in the context of\nfood security\nThe impacts of pests and diseases on yield in current\nconditions are well known, but the consequences of climate\nchange on pests and diseases are complex and, as the\npreceding descriptions attest, are still only imperfectly\nunderstood. Scherm et al. (2000) highlighted the importance\nof pests and diseases both as important yield-reducing\ncomponents and as early indicators of environmental\nchanges because of their short generation times, high\nreproductive rates, and efficient dispersal mechanisms.\nAttempts have been made to model the effects of changing\nclimate on the distribution of pests and pathogens particu-\nlarly using climatic mapping to delineate potential distribu-\ntions based on the concept of the fundamental niche (Baker\net al., 2000). While such approaches are open to criticism\nbecause climate alone does not determine distribution and\nClimate change, pests and pathogens | 2833\n at O\nxford Journals on February 3, 2012\nhttp:\/\/jxb.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nspecies interactions are ignored (Davis et al., 1998), climatic\nmapping provides a pragmatic means of investigating the\npotential for exotic pests and pathogens to establish in new\nareas (Baker et al., 2000) and a basis for implementing\nphytosanitary controls to restrict the entry, for example, of\nkarnal bunt (Tilletia indica) into Europe (Sansford et al.,\n2008). Changing climate has already affected the geograph-\nical distribution of some crop pests and pathogens [e.g.\nPuccinia graminis f.sp. tritici (stem rust) and Dickea\ndianthicola; Woods et al., 2005; Admassu et al., 2009;\nFig. 3.

Some pests which are\nalready present, but only occur in small areas or at low\ndensities, may be able to exploit the changing conditions by\nspreading more widely and reaching damaging population\ndensities. Aphids, for instance, key pests of agriculture,\nhorticulture, and forestry throughout the world, are\nexpected to be particularly responsive to climate change\nbecause of their low developmental threshold temperature,\nshort generation time, and considerable dispersal abilities\n(Sutherst et al., 2007). Together, the effects of changing\nclimate and more variable weather suggest that pest and\npathogen attacks are likely to be more unpredictable and\nthe amplitude larger. The consequences for other elements\nof agro-ecosystems and crop yields are still uncertain and\ngreater effort is required to integrate this science into\nestimates of actual crop productivity (Ingram et al., 2008).\nThe ability to include realistic impacts of pests and\ndiseases in future climates has a direct link to considerations\nof food security (Fig. 4). Ingram et al. (2008) point out that\nmore mechanistic inclusion of pests and disease effects on\ncrops would lead to more realistic predictions of crop\nproduction on a regional scale and thereby assist in the\ndevelopment of more robust regional food security policies.\nAs described in the introduction, economic and social issues\nare often dominant determinants of household food secu-\nrity, but changed pest and disease incidence under climate\nchange is an essential influence on future food security. The\ncurrently limited ability to model crop and pest and\npathogen interactions, coupled with increased unpredict-\nability of future pest and pathogen attacks means that\nsystematic monitoring, increased research on the biology of\nthe organisms, breeding of durable resistance in crops, and\nimproved modelling of the many interacting processes,\nwould be an essential underpinning investment for future\nfood security.\nAcknowledgements\nSCRI receives programme funds from the Scottish Govern-\nment and the GECAFS Project Office is supported by NERC.\nWe are grateful to Professor D Hopkins and Dr P Ianetta for\ncritical comments on an earlier draft and to I Pitkethly for\nassistance with the figures.\nReferences\nAdmassu B, Lind V, Freidt W, Ordon F. 2009.
