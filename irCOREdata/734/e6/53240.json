Introduction \nBuilding and civil engineers alike employ concrete in a broad area of applications. Over time, \nhowever, and as a direct consequence of the operating environment the concrete becomes corroded \nand\/or contaminated. This ultimately necessitates the arduous and costly undertaking of repairing or \nreplacing the affected concrete either by physical or mechanical means. Clearly, any means by which \nthe life of the concrete can extended would be of great interest to engineers. \nAs has been demonstrated in Part I of this paper, both the CO2 laser and the high power diode laser \n(HPDL) are feasible tools to produce a glaze on the hardened ordinary Portland cement (OPC) \nsurface of concrete. However, marked differences in the characteristics of the glazes generated on the \nOPC surface of concrete when treated with CO2 laser and HPDL radiation were clearly apparent. This \npart of the paper reports on the comparative testing of the CO2 and HPDL generated glazes in terms \nof their mechanical, chemical and physical properties, as well as a comparison with the untreated \nOPC surface properties. Mechanical tests were conducted to determine such properties as pull-off \n(bond) strength, rupture strength, wear resistance and absorptivity to water. Additionally, chemical \ntests were carried out to examine the corrosion resistance of the laser glazed and untreated OPC with \nregard to acid (nitric acid) alkali (sodium hydroxide) and common industrial detergent. Life \nassessment testing of the laser glazed and untreated OPC was also carried out. \n2. Experimental procedures and results \nCurrent British and international standards in relation to concrete and coated concrete are concerned \nonly with water sorptivity and compressive strength. No British or international standards exist \nregarding the testing of glazed concrete. It was therefore generally not possible to test the CO2 and \nHPDL generated glazes in strict accordance with established tests. As such, wherever possible tests \nbased on current standards or the work of others were developed to investigate specific aspects of \nparticular relevance to the laser generated glazes. These aspects were: the pull-off strength; the \nsurface roughness; the rupture strength; the wear resistance and the corrosion resistance.  \n \n2.1. Pull-off strength \n 4 \nTo determine the strength of the bond between the CO2 and HPDL generated glazes on the OPC \nsurface and the concrete substrate itself, pull-off tests were conducted based on the work of Bungey \net al. [1] and Carino [2]. For experimental convenience the concrete was prepared as relatively small \narea samples (25 mm x 25 mm). High tensile aluminium test dollies were then attached onto both the \nglazed surface, and to the axially opposite concrete substrate surface, using Araldite epoxy and left to \ncure for 24 hours. The diameter of the test dollies was 12 mm. In order to ensure axial accuracy \n(essential for true results) the test dollies were set in position using identical V-blocks. The samples \nwere placed into an Instron 4507 tensile\/compressive test rig by mounting the test dollies into the \njaws of the rig. A tensile force was then applied until sample failure, with the force being \nsimultaneously recorded. \nAs Fig. 1 shows, the results obtained varied markedly with both changes in the laser operating \nparameters and, perhaps more importantly, with the laser used. A post-test analysis of both the CO2 \nand HPDL generated surface glazes on the OPC surface revealed that the material failed well below \nthe laser treated surface, within the heat affected zone (HAZ). As is evident from Fig. 1, when using \nlaser operating parameters that produced good quality glazes with both lasers (1.5 kW cm-2 power \ndensity, 480 mm min-1 traverse speed), the average maximum pull-off force required for the CO2 laser \ngenerated glaze was recorded as 40.3 N, whilst the for the HPDL generated glaze the force required \nwas 235.6 N. This compares with 636.8 N for the untreated OPC surface of concrete.  \n2.2. Rupture strength \nIn order to determine the rupture strength of the CO2 and HPDL generated OPC glazes test samples \nwere prepared as described above. The samples were placed onto the sample stage of the Instron \n4507 tensile\/compressive test rig and then subjected to a compressive rupture force until the OPC \nglazes failed (cracked), with the energy being simultaneously recorded. The rupture force was applied \nby means of a high tensile steel indentor with a 1 mm radius point. The results of the tests revealed \nthat the average rupture strength of the CO2 and HPDL generated OPC glazes were very similar, only \n0.82 and 0.8 J respectively. In contrast, the rupture strength of the untreated OPC surface was some \n4.3 J. This is perhaps to be expected as the OPC surface has been partially (CO2 laser) and fully \n(HPDL) vitrified, effectively generating a glass. \n2.3. Water absorptivity testing \n 5 \nIn order to test the absorptivity of the CO2 and HPDL generated OPC glazes, a series of comparative \nexperiments with the untreated OPC surface were conducted in terms of water absorptivity. The tests \nwere conducted in accordance with the standard procedure employed by Hall et al. [3] and Wilson et \nal [4]. For the experiments the laser treated and untreated OPC samples were cut into smaller pieces \n(25 mm x 25 mm). The samples were then dried to a constant weight in an air oven at 650C to ensure \nall the pores were free of water. The OPC laser glazes and the untreated OPC surfaces were then \nimmersed in water and weighed at regular intervals. The side faces of the three samples were shielded \nfrom the water by means of an Araldite coating. In order to determine the absorptivity of the OPC \nlaser glazes and the untreated OPC surface, i was plotted against the square root of time so as to give \na straight line, as shown in Fig. 2. i is defined as \n   i\nm\nA\n=\n1000\u2206\n (1) \nwhere \u2206m is the cumulative change in mass with time and A is the immersed surface area. The \nsorptivity, s, of the laser generated OPC glazes and the untreated OPC surface is simply the gradient \nof this line.  \nAs one can see from Fig. 2, the sorptivity of the untreated OPC surface was a typical                             \n0.096 mm min-1\/2, compared with 0.047 mm min-1\/2 and 0.043 mm min-1\/2 for the CO2 and the HPDL \nglazed OPC surfaces respectively. It is therefore reasonable to conclude from this that both the laser \ngenerated glazes provided approximately twice as much resistance to water absorption than the \nuntreated OPC surface. In addition, it is a distinct possibility that the HAZ, which was identified as \nbeing composed of CaO resulting from the dehydration of the Ca(OH)2, may, once re-hydrated, act as \na barrier towards liquids such as water. In this way the HAZ may therefore augment the resistance of \nthe laser glazed OPC surface to water absorption. \n2.4. Wear life characteristics \nGenerally, the wear resistance of a material is primarily determined by the hardness of the material in \ncomparison with that of other materials with which it subsequently comes into contact with [5]. \nHowever, wear resistance does not always increase with hardness [6]. Tests were therefore conducted \nin accordance with the procedure detailed by Petitbon et al. [7] and Lawrence et al. [8] to determine \nthe exact difference in the wear resistance characteristics between the CO2 and HPDL generated OPC \nglazes, as well as those of the untreated OPC surface. For experimental purposes the OPC was cut \n 6 \ninto smaller pieces (25 mm x 25 mm), with half of the samples then being laser treated. All the \nsamples were then weighed and subjected to a friction force for a total of 8 h, being removed from \nthe machine and weighed at two hourly intervals. \nFig. 3 shows the relationship between weight loss and the friction time for the laser generated OPC \nglazes and the untreated OPC. As one can see, the wear resistance of the HPDL generated OPC glaze \nis fractionally greater than that of the CO2 laser generated OPC glaze. However, both the OPC laser \nglazes displayed a significant increase in wear resistance over the untreated OPC surface, with the \nweight loss being approximately 2 times lower after 4 h, and 3 times lower after 8 h. \n2.5. Corrosion resistance \nConcrete surfaces are often subjected to corrosive substances, either as part of the normal service \nenvironment and\/or as a result of routine cleaning. Therefore, corrosion resistance tests based upon \nBS 6431 [9] were conducted using nitric acid, sodium hydroxide and Premier Products MP9 \ndetergent cleaner. The experiments were carried out by dropping small amounts of the corrosive \nagents on to the surface of the CO2 and HPDL glazed OPC surfaces, as well as the untreated OPC \nsurface of the concrete, at hourly intervals for four hours. The reagents were applied in the \nconcentration ratios of 80%, 60%, 40%, 20% and 10%. The samples were then examined optically, as \nwell as being mechanically tested in terms of compressive strength and wear. High concentrations of \nthe various corrosive agents were used principally to accelerate the tests. However, in practice 60% \nnitric acid is used within the nuclear processing industry as a solvent for nuclear fuels [10].  \nAll three substances in the concentrations 80%, 60% and 40% were seen to immediately attack the \nuntreated OPC surface, with the nitric acid and sodium hydroxide attacking with greater severity than \nthe detergent. On the other hand, both the CO2 and HPDL glazed surfaces displayed no discernible \nmicrostructural changes or signs of devitrification due to corrosion.  \nTests conducted according to ASTM C579-91 [11] revealed that exposure of the untreated OPC \nsurface to the reagents had a significant effect on the compressive strength and the wear resistance of \nthe OPC. Exposure of the OPC to nitric acid and sodium hydroxide in the concentrations 40-80% \nresulted in an average loss of compressive strength of approximately 19-37%. In the case of the \ndetergent a discernible loss in compressive strength only occurred with concentrations above 40%. \nHere the average loss in compressive strength for concentrations in the range 60-80% was \napproximately 17%. This compares with no discernible difference in either the wear resistance or the \n 7 \ncompressive strength of the laser glazed OPC surfaces. Similarly, the wear resistance of the untreated \nOPC surface when exposed to the reagents with an 80% concentration was significantly affected, \nparticularly through interaction with the nitric acid and the sodium hydroxide. Here the weight loss \nwas approximately 5 times higher than for the unexposed OPC after 4 h, and approximately 11 times \nhigher after 8 h for the nitric acid. In the case of the detergent the weight loss was marginal after both \n4 and 8 h. \n3. Discussion \nAs the results of the mechanical and chemical tests show, the CO2 and HPDL generated OPC glazes \nout performed the untreated OPC surface in many of the test areas. This was especially true in the \ncase of chemical resistance, where both of the OPC laser glazes proved to be resistant to both in the \ntime of the experiments. This marked variation in corrosion resistance can be ascribed to the \ndifference in structure of the laser generated OPC glazes and the untreated OPC. Whereas the HPDL \ngenerated OPC glaze is of a fully amorphous nature, and the CO2 laser OPC glaze is of a semi-\namorphous nature, the untreated OPC is comprised of a porous polycrystalline structure. Thus the \nuntreated OPC is readily attacked by acids, whilst the amorphous structure of both OPC laser glazes \nensures an increase in acid resistance [12].  \nThe superior mechanical and chemical performance of the laser generated OPC glazes over the \nuntreated OPC suggests that the life characteristics of the glazes may also be superior to those of \nuntreated OPC. Yet in any practical analysis of the wear life of materials, the in-situ relative \nthicknesses of the materials must be considered. Consequently the laser generated OPC glazes and \nthe untreated OPC layer on concrete must be taken into consideration in any calculations in order to \ngive a true interpretation of the actual life characteristics. Thus the increase in wear life can be given \nby \n Increase in wear life =  \nLaser glaze wear life\nUntreated OPC wear life\n (2) \nwhere, Wear life =  \nDensity .  Thickness (mg.cm .cm)\nWear rate (mg.cm .h )\n-3\n-2 -1\n (2a) \nTable 1 summarises the wear rate details and the nominal life increase of both the CO2 and HPDL \ngenerated OPC glazes over the untreated OPC surface. As Table 1 shows, the laser generated OPC \n 8 \nglazes gave an increase in actual life over the untreated OPC surface regardless of the environment. \nNonetheless, as one can see from Table 1 the increase in actual life of the laser generated OPC glazes \nover the untreated OPC surface varies considerably depending upon the working environment. \nHowever, arguably the most common working environment for an OPC surface would involve some \ncontact with at least detergent acids, therefore significant economic savings may be yielded since a \nOPC surface glazed with either laser lasts around 2.5-times longer than one which is unglazed. \nFurthermore, as Fig. 3 and Table 1 both show clearly, the wear rate and the wear life of the HPDL \ngenerated glaze was, although similar in value, consistently higher than that of the CO2 laser \ngenerated glaze. This is believed to be due to the effects of the greater occurrence of porosities, in \nparticular the \u2018knife edge\u2019 porosities discussed in Part I of this paper, which are prone to excessive \nwear. Consequently, the wear rate of the CO2 laser glaze will therefore be somewhat higher than that \nof the HPDL glaze. \nOf great importance is the resistance to water absorption afforded the concrete as a result of laser \nglazing with both the CO2 and the HPDL. As Fig. 2 suggests, the CO2 laser glaze offered slightly less \nresistance to water absorption than the HPDL glaze. Again, this is likely to be due to the greater \nprevalence of not only porosities, but cracks, in the CO2 laser glaze which will inherently allow more \nwater to permeate through the glaze and be absorbed by the concrete.  \nAs is evident from Fig. 1, surface glazing of the OPC with either laser effected a considerable \ndecrease in the pull-off strength in comparison with the untreated OPC surface of the concrete. \nHowever, a significant difference between the required pull-off force of the CO2 and the HPDL \nglazed surfaces was apparent, 40.3 N compared with 235.6 N respectively. This marked difference \ncan perhaps be attributed to the fact that the HAZ generated on the OPC after CO2 laser glazing was \nmuch larger than that generated as a result of HPDL glazing (see Part I of this paper). Thus, a larger \ndehydrated and CaO rich area is generated which is therefore inherently weaker. \n4. Conclusion \nA comparative study of the mechanical, chemical and physical properties of the surface glaze \ngenerated on hardened ordinary Portland cement (OPC) paste by means of CO2 and a high power \ndiode laser (HPDL) radiation has been conducted. Furthermore, the performance of both laser \ngenerated glazes has been compared with that of the untreated OPC surface. It was found that: (i) The \n 9 \nrequired pull-off force after laser glazing was reduced from 636.8 N to 235.6 N after HPDL glazing \nand 40.3 N after CO2 laser glazing. The general reduction in required pull-off force after laser glazing \nis believed to be due to the inherent generation of a heat affected zone (HAZ) comprising mainly of \nweaker CaO. Similarly, the marked difference between the pull-off strength of the CO2 and HPDL \nglaze can be attributed to the fact that the HAZ after HPDL glazing was much smaller than that of the \nCO2 laser glaze. (ii) The average rupture strength of the CO2 and HPDL generated OPC glazes were \nvery similar, 0.82 and 0.8 J respectively, whilst the rupture strength of the untreated OPC surface was \nsome 4.3 J. This is because laser glazing of the OPC surface has resulted in partial (CO2 laser) and \nfull (HPDL) vitrification, effectively generating a glass. (iii) Laser glazing of the OPC surface \nafforded the concrete approximately twice as much resistance to water absorptivity than the untreated \nsurface, 0.096 mm min-1\/2 compared with 0.047 mm min-1\/2 and 0.043 mm min-1\/2 for the CO2 and the \nHPDL glazes respectively. The slightly higher water absorptivity of the CO2 laser glaze is likely to be \ndue to the greater prevalence of porosities and cracks in the CO2 laser glaze; which will inherently \nallow more water to permeate through the glaze and be absorbed by the concrete. (iv) Life assessment \ntesting revealed that surface glazing of the OPC with both the CO2 and the HPDL effected an increase \nin wear life of 1.3 to 17.7 times over an untreated OPC surface, depending upon the corrosive \nenvironment. The wear life and the wear rate of the HPDL glaze was consistently higher than that of \nthe CO2 laser glaze. (v) Both the CO2 and HPDL glazed OPC surfaces displayed no discernible \nmicrostructural changes or signs of devitrification resulting from exposure to corrosive agents. In \ncontrast, the corrosive agents were seen to immediately attack the untreated OPC surface. Clearly, the \neconomic and material benefits to be gained from the deployment of such an effective and efficient \ncoating on OPC could be significant. \n \n \n 10 \nReferences \n1. J.H. Bungey, R.
