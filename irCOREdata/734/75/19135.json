These methods presump-\ntively identify variants but cannot positively identify\nany variant. Precise variant identification requires pro-\ntein sequencing or DNA analysis. The majority of Hb\nvariants listed in the Globin Gene Server [1] database\nresult from a single point mutation in either the \u0001- or \u0002\nglobin gene that leads to the production of a single\namino acid substitution in either the \u0001- or \u0002-chain of the\nHb protein. Although many of these variants may be\ninnocuous, once detected in a first-line hospital screen,\nit is sensible to precisely identify the mutation.\nA procedure for identifying Hb variants by electro-\nspray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) has been\ndescribed previously [2, 3]. There are three steps in this\nprocedure. The first step involves analyzing blood\ndiluted in a denaturing solvent to determine the molec-\nular weight of the variant chain and assign the variant\nto the \u0001- or \u0002-chain. In the second step, diluted blood is\ndigested with trypsin and the resulting mixture of\npeptides analyzed directly by ESI-MS. The third step\ninvolves sequencing the variant tryptic peptide by\ntandem mass spectrometry if required.

Using this procedure\nand applying the \u0001-chain mass for internal calibration,\nthe normal \u0002-chain mass can be determined with a\nprecision of \u00030.03 Da standard deviation [4]. Important\nminor Hb fractions, such as HbA1C (assessment of\nlong-term glycemic control in diabetics) [5\u20137] and HbA2\n(biomarker for \u00020-thalassemia trait) [8], are also de-\ntected and quantified using these procedures following\ncalibration with standards.\nThe above procedure involves sequencing peptides\nvia low-energy collision-induced dissociation (CID) in a\ntriple quadrupole instrument, and\u000195% of the variants\nencountered in practice can be identified. However,\nthere are a number of variants that involve amino acid\nexchanges governed by single mutations in the nucleo-\ntide codon to either leucine (Leu) or isoleucine (Ile),\nwhich cannot be differentiated using this procedure.\nLeu and Ile are isomeric species. Therefore, low-energy\nCID of variant peptide precursor ions, which contain\neither Leu or Ile, generates sequence ions [9] of the same\nm\/z and renders unequivocal assignment of these spe-\ncies impossible.\nHere, we describe a mass spectrometric approach,\nwhich allows distinction between Leu and Ile when char-\nacterizing human hemoglobinopathies. This approach uti-\nlizes hot electron capture dissociation (HECD) [10] on a\nFourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR)\nmass spectrometer. In conventional (low-energy) ECD\n[11, 12], peptide backbone cleavage occurs at the N-C\u0001\nbond to produce c= and z\u2022 ions. These fragments also\nresult from HECD but are accompanied by extensive\nsecondary fragmentation due to the excess energy.\nSecondary fragmentation of amino acid side chains of\nz\u2022 ions result in the formation of w ions. The loss of\n\u2022CH(CH3)2 (\u000243 Da) or \u2022CH2CH3 (\u000229 Da) from z\u2022\nions containing N-terminal Leu or Ile, respectively,\nScheme 1. Secondary fragmentation of a z\u2022 io\na leucine residue and (b) an isoleucine residue.enables the two amino acids to be distinguished, see\nScheme 1. This method has been demonstrated on\nsynthetic peptides [10] and the bovine milk protein PP3\n[13]. In the present example, a blood sample was found\nto contain three variants, one of which involved a\nmutation to either Leu or Ile. Here we show how HECD\nwas used to resolve the ambiguity and identify a novel\n\u0002-chain variant. To confirm the assignment, HECD of\nLeu- and Ile-containing synthetic analogues of the tryp-\ntic peptide containing the variant was also performed.\nThis work demonstrates the significant potential role of\nHECD in the characterization of these types of Hb\nmutation, and also constitutes the first true clinical\napplication of the HECD technique.\nMethods\nCation-Exchange HPLC\nCation-exchange HPLC with UV detection was per-\nformed on a VARIANT HPLC system using the Variant\n\u0002-thalassemia Short program (Bio-Rad Laboratories\nLtd., Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, UK).\nSample Preparation\nThe procedures for identifying variants in blood sam-\nples by mass spectrometry have been previously de-\nscribed in detail elsewhere [2, 3].

Initial\nexperiments were undertaken on a triple quadrupole\nmass spectrometer (Quattro Ultima; Waters MS Tech-\nnologies, Manchester, UK) equipped with the standard\nZ-spray electrospray ion source and operated at a\nsource and desolvation temperature of 110 \u00b0C. Sample\nsolutions were introduced into the source region of the\ninstrument at a rate of 5 \u0004L\/min. The instrument was\noperated in positive mode of ionization, with a capillary\nvoltage of 3 kV, a cone voltage of 80 V, and hexapole 1\nion guide set to 60 V. Tandem mass spectrometry\n(MS\/MS) was carried out using argon collision gas at a\npressure of 2.5 \u0003 10\u00023 mbar within the RF-only hexa-\npole collision cell. Fragmentation of the precursor tryp-\ntic peptide ions was achieved with a collision energy of\n30 eV.\nFT-ICR analysis was performed on a Thermo Finni-\ngan LTQ FT mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scien-\ntific, Bremen, Germany). Samples were injected by use\nof an Advion Biosciences Triversa electrospray source\n(Advion Biosciences, Ithaca, NY, USA) at a flow rate of\n\u0004200 nL\/min. For all experiments, scans were acquired\nin the ICR cell with a resolution of 100,000 at m\/z 400.\nECD and HECD of tryptic peptide: precursor ions were\nisolated in the linear ion trap and transferred to the ICR\ncell for (H)ECD.

The current across the electrode was\n\u00041.1 A.

Mass spectra\nshown comprise one scan.Results\nA blood sample was submitted for investigation by mass\nspectrometry because abnormalities had been detected\nduring a routine antenatal screen in a hospital hematology\nlaboratory using ce-HPLC. The ce-HPLC chromatogram\n(Figure 1) showed two abnormal peaks, which eluted after\nthe time for normal adult Hb (A0, 2.44 min). The elution\ntime of the earlier peak (4.50 min) corresponds to that of\nthe clinically significant Sickle variant, but the peak itself is\natypical in that there appear to be shoulders on both its\nleading and trailing edges. A sickle cell solubility test was\npositive. Apart from the unusual ce-HPLC chromato-\ngram, no other hematological abnormalities were ob-\nserved. To clarify these anomalies, the sample was sub-\nmitted for analysis by ESI-MS.\nInitially, mass spectrometric analysis was performed\non a triple quadrupole instrument. Analysis of the intact\nHb chains revealed the presence of one \u0001-chain variant\nand, surprisingly, two \u0002-chain variants (Figure 2). The\n\u0001-chain variant was 14 Da heavier than normal and its\nproportion of total \u0001-chains was 28.3%. It was identified\nfrom a 30-min tryptic digest as Hb Stanleyville II\n(\u000178{EF7}Asn\u00a1Lys). The lighter \u0002-chain variant (normal\n\u0002\u000230Da and 42.2% of total \u0002-chains) was confirmed from\nthe same digest as Hb Sickle (\u00026{A3}Glu\u00a1Val). The un-\nexpected third variant was 14 Da heavier than the normal\n\u0002-chain and its mutant amino acid was shown from the\nspectrum of the tryptic digest to occur in the \u0002T5 peptide\n(Figure 3). There are nine potential mutations in this\npeptide that could give a 14 Da mass increase by a single\nbase change in the nucleotide codon. To distinguish these\npossibilities, the normal and variant \u0002T52\u0005 ions were\nsequenced by tandem mass spectrometry using low-energy\nCID (Figure 4). The 14 Damass increase at y\u00066 between the\nspectra from (a) the normal peptide and (b) the variant\npeptide placed the mutation at \u000254, but did not allow\n\u000254Val\u00a1Leu to be distinguished from \u000254Val\u00a1Ile.\nTo precisely characterize the mutation and resolve\nthe ambiguity between these two isomeric amino acids,\nthe variant \u0002T52\u0005 ion was subjected to hot ECD.

The assignment was con-\nfirmed by performing HECD on the synthetic analogues\nof these peptides. The codon for the \u000254Val is GTT. The\ncodons for Ile are ATT, ATC, and ATA, and those for\nLeu are TTA, TTG, CTT, CTC, CTA, and CTG. Thus we\nconclude that the Askew variant is the result of a single\nbase change in the nucleotide codon, GTT\u00a1 ATT.\nAcknowledgments\nJPW thanks the Warwick University Research Development Fund\nfor a grant and Professor Peter J.
