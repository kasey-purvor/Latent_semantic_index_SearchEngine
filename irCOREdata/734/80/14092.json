While \nestablishing best practice benchmarks for the provision of quality online distance \neducation, the report does not fully address important policy issues in relation to the role \nof technology in the selection of appropriate teaching and learning strategies. \nFurthermore, it does not address the important question of the management of \norganizational change in today's higher education environment. This paper explores the \nnexus between organizational culture and organizational c imate in the management of\nchange process by presenting a case study of an Australian regional university currently \nundertaking the development of online courses. \nChange \nTheobold (1997) suggests, in his last book Reworking Success, that we are continually \nbeing confronted with major challenges which require profound changes in every aspect of \nour lives. Organizational leaders talk about 'turbulent imes' and 'discontinuous times', \nwhere we face a future that is essentially unknowable (Stacey, 1992). No longer do linear \nmodels of cause-effect apply, if they ever did. Management cannot afford the luxury of \nadopting a reactive stance in the face of forces of change that are emanating from within \nor, alternatively, looming over the horizon. \nThe management of change is perhaps the most daunting challenge facing senior managers \nin organizations today. During times of change there are at least wo camps, those wanting to \nimplement the change and those who feel they will suffer under the change. The latter group \nviews managers as 'inflictors of change'. Both groups are motivated ifferently, one by the \ndesire to move forward and the other by the understandable d sire to remain within the safe \nand comfortable status quo. Many simply throw up their hands in despair complaining of \nsymptoms of 'change fatigue'. There are times, however, when organizational members are \ngenuinely excited by the challenge of confronting the unknown. Hence, the dynamic \ninteraction between the desire for security and change is always with us. \nTechnology and change management \nOrganizations need to scan the environment continuously in an attempt to detect he winds \nof change and move quickly and proactively to position themselves in anticipation of those \nchange forces. Of all the drivers, technology has brought about he most radical change. A \nthird industrial revolution has occurred within the manufacturing industry with the advent \nof computer-integrated systems. Here robotics have all but replaced the assembly-line \nworker as the pace of automation is stepped up. It is argued below that the same fate \npotentially awaits academics as they are thrust increasingly into the role of knowledge \nworkers. Elsewhere, microelectronics and fibre optics have turned the information and \ncommunication i dustries upside down. Nowhere is this more true than in universities \nwhere technological determinism is rife today. The availability of this new technology \ntogether with the force of economic pressures, owing to changes in national and \ninternational markets, makes it imperative for organizations to anticipate and manage the \n74 \nAIt-] Volume 9 Number I \nforces of change if they wish to survive. Yet the manner in which they are taking up the \nchallenge is threatening the very foundations of the traditional university (Coady, 2000). \nThe role of culture and climate in managing change \nIt was commonplace in the 1980s and 1990s for change agents to focus their efforts on \nreshaping the existing culture as a mechanism for accommodating change. Organizational \nchange came to be seen as synonymous with cultural change (Bate, 1995; Deal and \nKennedy, 1982; Legge, 1994). What follows is a brief discussion of culture and its \nrelationship with itstwin concept climate. \n\u2022 Organizational culture embraces shared assumptions, including beliefs and values, that \ndetermine what needs doing and how it can be done. Key values and beliefs of an \norganization most often are embodied in the language of memos, reports or policy \nstatements and reflect a number of recurring elements including widely shared values \n(e.g. the customer comes first) which are often implicit and almost taken for granted \n(Kabanoff, 1993). Because change is occurring in an increasingly complex and rapid \nmanner the strategy of reshaping the existing culture is no longer workable. Culture \nchanges lowly in spite of the efforts of management to accelerate the process for, as \nFullan so aptly put it, you cannot mandate what matters (Fullan, 1993). Instead, \nleaders of change-focused cultures have turned their attention to the management of\norganizational climate. Ashforth (1985) claims that organizational climate is an \nempiricist substitute for the richer term culture, which \n\u2022 embodies members' collective perceptions about their organization with respect o \nsuch dimensions as autonomy, trust, cohesiveness, support, recognition, innovation \nand fairness; \n\u2022 is produced by member interaction; \n\u2022 serves as a basis for interpreting the situation; and \n\u2022 reflects the prevalent norms, values and attitudes of the organization's culture. \n(Moran and Volkwein, 1992: 20) \nSimply put, organizational climate is a by-product of naturally occurring interactions \nbetween people and is reflected in all of the following: \n\u2022 levels of stress; \n\u2022 the extent o which people are treated fairly; \n\u2022 the ways in which decisions are made; \n\u2022 the sharing of power; \n\u2022 the management of information; \n\u2022 mechanisms for recognizing individual excellence; and \n\u2022 empowerment processes that enable people to do their jobs autonomously. \nThus it can be seen that these twin organizational variables hare a number of overlapping \nattributes and while it is conceded that the concepts of culture and climate are not co- \n75 \nDonald W McMurray A case study in the development of online learning \nextensive, some authors (Turnipseed, 1988) claim it is not a large conceptual step from \nshared assumptions (culture) to shared perceptions (climate). There needs to be a recogni- \ntion that climate, as well as being influenced by culture, is simultaneously capable of \nshaping culture. Where there is non-alignment of culture and climate the likelihood of \nsuccessful organizational change is diminished. \nTo summarize, organizational members develop shared perceptions of their workplace (i.e. \nclimate) in large part against a common frame of reference (i.e. culture) that is continually \ncreated and re-created. It is strongly contended in this paper that the climate of the organiza- \ntion, if properly managed, will contribute to an enduring organizational culture which in \nturn will be better able to deal with the inevitability of change. Where elements of climate are \npoorly managed or not managed at all, organizational members will resist change openly. \nThe culture of the new university in Australia \nCoady (2000) has documented the impact of some of the change forces operating on \nAustralian universities today. Innovation, flexibility, responsiveness and the creative \nredefinition of markets have become the new sources of competitive advantage in an \nincreasingly interconnected global economy (Dess and Picken, 2000). Amongst higher \neducation managers the quest is under way to find ways of attracting and maintaining \nenrolments from a dwindling pool of students. The drive for increased efficiency has been \nunderway for a number of years now as government funding continues to shrink and \nuniversities redirect heir energies towards a new constituency, that of the full fee-paying \nstudent. In the last eight years money from full fee-paying students has trebled from $500 \nmillion to $1.5 billion (Way, 2000). In this new corporate nvironment, however, the \npayment of fees redefines the student as customer and in the interests of customer \nsatisfaction there has been a subtle shift for the responsibility for learning from the student \nto the academic (Kenway and Langmead, 1998). \nThe application of business management principles to the running of the university has \nbeen accompanied by stricter controls, greater work pressures, more clearly defined jobs, \ntighter supervision and the introduction of performance appraisals. It is clear that these \nregressive measures have just about run their course in terms of their ability to provide \ntertiary education institutions with efficiency gains. Now, out of a sense of urgency; \nmanagement is turning to other initiatives as a way of securing new markets. Prominent \namongst hese is online learning and the accompanying claim that technology-driven \neducation is the key to vastly improved learning. A more cynical view is that online \neducation serves the aggregated interests of rationalization, corporatization and \nmarketization (Kenway and Langmead, 1998). A careful reading of the Review of Higher \nEducation Financing Policy (West, 1998) points to a hyper-rationalist view that the \nintroduction of new technology will bring about a cost reduction in higher education. \nThe online experience at a small regional university \nIn 1998 the executive of a small regional university in the north-east of New South Wales, \nfunded two significant projects in two schools. The joint venture involved the application \nof project management methodology tothe development a d delivery of a suite of online \nunits within these schools (Phelps, Ledgerwood, and Bartlett, 2000). \n76 \nAIt-j Volume 9 Number I \nIt is not the intention of this paper to detail these initiatives as these projects have been \ndiscussed in several articles to date (Ellis, forthcoming; Ellis and Phelps, 2000; Klich, \nFitzgerald and Wallace, 1999; McMurray and Dunlop, 2000). This paper addresses the \nbroader issues arising out of the project in one of the schools and specifically is concerned \nwith technological, administrative, instructional and academic matters surrounding the \nonline delivery of education. An attempt will be made to assess the impact of these issues \non the twin organizational variables of culture and climate in a university in the process of \nlarge-scale change. \nThe allocation of funding to these two projects was made contingent upon the \nestablishment of two project management boards which assumed control of all planning, \norganizing and reporting functions. As noted by Phelps et al. (2000) academic ourse \ndevelopment in universities has not often occurred within a project management \nframework. Formal structures for responsibility and accountability do not sit well with \nacademics, who are accustomed to operating autonomously or as part of a small collegial \nteam. For both projects online delive\/y was to involve more than simply 'Web mounting' \nthe content of print-based off-campus units. They specifically set out to explore whether \nWeb-based units could be seen as a tool to enhance student learning outcomes and not just \na medium for delivery. The focus was to be on putting students in contact with other \nstudents and not simply connecting them to a vast database where interactivity is reduced \nto a series of mouse clicks and the teacher is all but non-existent (Green, 1999). \nThe employment of project management methodology to develop the online initiative \ncreated tensions from the beginning that were to affect both the climate and culture of the \norganization. Academics clashed openly with senior managers on the project management \nboard over what one side viewed as i sues relating to academic freedom, and the other side \nsaw as issues concerning the shift towards managerialism within the university. \nClearly management was preoccupied with the online project as a product o be marketed \nto a range of clients, including overseas tudents, whereas the academic developers were \nmore process-orientated as they set about enhancing teaching and learning in a new and \nexciting medium (Phelps et al., 2000). Academics were strongly of the view that learning \nexperiences need to be structured on sound pedagogy and not simply be a showcase for the \nlatest platform used to promote online learning. Management, on the other hand, seemed \nto have adopted the belief that future educational outcomes are guaranteed by \ntechnological progress and that this in turn will lead to the best of all possible worlds \n(social progress). What in fact happened is that the interests of the powerful were being \nenacted under the guise of social progress. Academics were relegated to the role of \n'knowledge workers' whose primary task, it seemed, was to connect clients with \ninformation (Heron, 1996), while at the same time power flowed increasingly to the upper \nechelons of the university to those who managed and marketed that knowledge. It is \ncontended strongly that knowledge cannot be managed separately from those people who \nhave formulated the intellectual basis to that knowledge. \nIt was one thing for academics to hand over the responsibility for the 'look and feel' of the \nunits to the Information Technology Directorate, but another thing entirely when \nimportant decisions about the choice of delivery shell and supporting software were made \nwithout consultation, involvement or debate. A decision was made to adopt an off-the- \n77 \nDonald W McMurray A case study in the development of online learning \nshelf commercial product rather than custom write course software. Accordingly, the \nUniversity entered into an agreement with a large computer corporation to acquire the use \nof one of its platforms as a delivery shell. The software could also be used in conjunction \nwith a browser. The decision to proceed with the shell was made despite the growing \nconviction from the majority of the academic staff developers that it would prove to be \ninordinately difficult for students to cope with. As the initial evaluation (Hayden, Saenger \nand Parry, 1999) showed, staff concerns were justified. While many staff had found the \nshell relatively easy to develop their online materials within, it became problematic n the \nhands of students in remote areas without he level of technological support he staff had \nenjoyed uring the development phase. Ultimately for online education to succeed it must \nmeet he needs of the end-user independently of any advantages that might accrue to the \nacademic developer along the way (Griffiths, 2000). \nMany academics, accustomed to exercising autonomy with respect to developing and \ndelivering learning materials, openly resisted the role the Information Technology \nDirectorate of the University assumed in making decisions that often were seen as having \npedagogical overtones (McMurray and Dunlop, 2000). For example, changes were made to \nthe content of units without prior consultation with or notification to the academic \nresponsible for the development of the online unit. On another occasion an academic was \nadvised that a unit he had developed and delivered to distance ducation students in \nAustralia was to be offered in its existing format offshore. When reservations were expressed \nregarding the cultural relevance of some of the content the academic was informed that if he \ndid not agree to teach the course they (the Information Technology Directorate) would find \nsomeone who would. As Passmore (2000) notes these kinds of decisions raise serious \nquestions about the topic of intellectual property in terms of who owns and controls the \nproducts and the processes of online initiatives. Green (1999) questions whether educational \ntechnologists are there to support and assist knowledge workers in the tertiary sector or is the \nultimate goal to replace them? Are our leaders dreaming of teacherless education? And what \nthen are the pedagogical implications of a technology-orientated knowledge base? \nThere is little doubt that the most precious relationship n a university is the one between \nthe academic teachers and their students (Manne, 2000). It is understandable, therefore, \nthat online deliverers within the school, when asked to provide management with \nunrestricted access to the online units, reacted strongly in defence of what they saw as an \ninvasion of students' privacy. For their troubles they were castigated for presuming to\ninstitute policy that would have institution-wide ramifications. Academics held fast to the \nnotion that opening up the units to scrutiny from above would constitute an unwarranted \nintrusion into the communication relationships the students had established with their \ninstructor and with each other. \nThe manner in which these decisions were taken was interpreted by some staff as signalling \na shift in university governmentality from one of supporting a culture of teaching, learning \nand research to one which is setting off down a path of hyper-competitiveness where \ncorporatization and globalization become the driving forces (Kenway and Langmead, \n1998) and where academic autonomy isthreatened. \nOn another level the tensions between the academics and the project management board \ncan be better understood as being the product of the lack of alignment between the \n78 \nAIt-] Volume 9 Number I \norganizational culture and climate of sections of the university. As mentioned earlier, these \ntwo concepts are inextricably intertwined and it is clear that university policy as reflected in \nmanagement decisions served to undermine an otherwise healthy school climate. \nSuperimposing a project management structure over online development was tantamount- \nto overwriting a stable subclimate of the organization with an organizational cu ture that \nwas attempting to shift oo far, too quickly and in an unwelcome direction (Hayden et al., \n1999). \nThere had been consultation atthe university over the development of the online initiative \nbut it had for the most part involved communicating information about decisions which \nhad already been made by senior management within the university. A case in point \ninvolved the adoption of Learning Space as the delivery shell. At a special meeting called \nin good faith by the Head of School towards the end of the developmental phase, and \nprior to the initial delivery of the online units, concerned academics spent two hours \nvoicing their concerns over what they saw as problematic with this delivery shell. Later, it \nwas learned that a contract binding the university to the supplier for a period of three years \nhad already been signed at higher management levels. The suppression of open dialogue \ncaused unnecessary staff angst. \nWhile the literature is replete with examples of how this top-down 'command and control' \nstyle of management can inhibit organizational learning, somehow management ploughed \nahead. As it turned out the worst fears of the academics were realized. In their initial \nevaluation, Hayden et al. (1999) reported that the successful rate of completion for the \nschool's online units was just 58 per cent compared with almost 90 per cent for both \nconventional distance ducation and face-to-face enrolments. Further, the chief reason \ncited for the large attrition rate was the frustration associated with installing and \nnavigating within the chosen platform. The learning curve at the front end was simply too \nsteep for many students who gave up in despair and reverted to the traditional external \nmode of study. \nThe above examples underline the fact that we have witnessed the demise of one of the \nmost time-honoured structures of the university - that of the collective decision-making \nstructure known as collegiality. Collegiality and academic freedom count for little in the \neyes of the managers of the business enterprise as they compete openly with other \nuniversities for limited government funding and market. True collegiality does not involve \ntalking about hings in general, nor entering into mere dialogue but involves open-minded \nconsideration of all the issues involved and reaching a consensus, through an increase in \nsynergy, not by accepting the lowest common denominator (Coady, 2000). \nAre universities learning organizations? \nUpon reflection, given that our masters were determined to take the university down this \nhyper-competitive road, surely it was incumbent upon them to do so by utilizing the best \navailable knowledge on how best to proceed. The literature surrounding the emergence of \nthe learning organization would have been a good place to begin (Argyris and Schon, 1996; \nGrieves, 2000; Hase, 1998; and Senge, 1990). There they would have discovered the folly of \nattempting tomandate change in a top-down fashion by re-engineering the existing culture \n(Legge, 1994). \n79 \nDonald W McMurray A case study in the development of online learning \nMost universities are still hierarchically structured with clearly defined lines of authority, \nresponsibility and control. Yet in these rapidly changing times universities, like any \nlearning organization, need to be flexible and adaptable to survive and grow. Interactive \nconsultation is a common thread that runs through all the disciplines of the learning \norganization. This is a process of sharing thoughts and feelings through talking things out \nwith others in an atmosphere of co-operation and openness with a commitment to \naccomplishing some definite, common purpose. It seems obvious that senior management \nat the university believe control and responsibility would be lost if employees are involved \nin this process. \nWhat has resulted is a lack of 'goodness of fit' between the culture and climate of the \nuniversity. The new operating systems imposed by management are at odds with the \ntraditional worthwhile values of the university. What is called for is a basic reassessment of \nthe value of the academic's worth to the university. Here, it is important o distinguish \nbetween 'system' and 'value' changes within the university. A system change simply \nencompasses changed processes or procedures. Value changes, on the other hand, run \ndeeper. In the end, value changes arising out of new workplace relations will be the driver \nof organizational change. Open dialogue is needed around worthwhile change as opposed \nto imposed change. \nThere are a number of factors contributing to a lack of 'goodness of fit' between culture \nand climate in the university including: \n\u2022 management's u e of power and authority to stifle debate; \n\u2022 lack of vision and poorly communicated plans for change; \n\u2022 lack of adequate resources; \n\u2022 differential treatment of staff, some of whom feel isolated; \n\u2022 communication barriers between staff and management; and \n\u2022 conflicting personalities fuelled by differing values and ethics. \nIt can be seen that these elements are features of organizational c imate which need to be \nmanaged carefully when people are being asked to change. Change has to be perceived by \npeople as something happening through them and not to them. No one copes well with the \nfeeling of 'not having been consulted'. What emerges during this phase is a new \norganizational culture. But this is not something that can be manipulated by a leader \nindependently of the experiences of the followers for they are equally the carriers of the \nnew culture and are in a position to unite or sabotage the change process. \nChange of the kind associated with moving to an online environment is not a one-step \nprocess for academics, but one that sees them in transition as they let go of the old and \nprepare to embrace the new. A key question that needs to be asked is: 'How much of the \npast do they need to let go in order to embrace the future?' \nIn fact, this is the time for senior management to be asking questions but not he kind that \ngive rise to a strategic plan such as the following might: \n\u2022 What makes our organization unique? \n80 \nAIt-] Volume 9 Number I \n\u2022 What are the change-forces impacting on our business? \n\u2022 What are the threats and what are the opportunities? \n\u2022 What is it that our customers eally want? \nImportant though these questions may be, they are premature. The following kinds of \nquestions need to be asked: \n\u2022 Why do you work here? \n\u2022 What was it hat originally attracted you to this organization? \n\u2022 Have things changed in this regard? \n\u2022 What things do you really value that you find missing in your workplace? \nOf course what will be revealed are people's needs, values and beliefs. Aggregated together \nthey represent members' perceptions about he climate of the organization and the way in \nwhich it operates. Once defined, these values and beliefs will serve asa series of powerful \nrudders that will assist in navigating the turbulent waters of change. In the final analysis \nthe message isquite simple: manage the climate and the culture will look after itself. In the \nend a new culture will emerge but it will be one that is congruent with, and a reflection of, \nthe prevailing organizational climate. \nReferences \nArgyris, C. and Schon, D. A.
