Introduction\nThe X-ray background is the echo of the growth of the Black\nHoles, which we see in the center of most galaxies today. A\nlarge fraction of the background has been resolved into dis-\ncrete sources, being almost 100% below 2 keV and about 50%\nat 10 keV (Worsley et al. 2004). Since the peak of the back-\nground is at 30 keV, much still has to be resolved and we need\ndetailed population synthesis models to understand the total\nbackground. A significant uncertainty still exists in the total\nflux of the XRB (Revnivtsev et al. 2003).\nThe observed background spectrum can be reproduced well\nby models folding the observed X-ray luminosity function and\nits evolution over cosmic time with AGN spectra observed\nthrough different amounts of neutral hydrogen column den-\nsity following unified AGN models (Comastri et al. 1995; Gilli\net al. 2001).\nAn important ingredient to the background synthesis mod-\nels is the average X-ray spectrum of AGN, which at the mo-\nment has been largely taken from local samples of Seyfert-1\nand Seyfert-2 galaxies. The typical model includes at least\ntwo parameters: the slope of the AGN spectrum and absorb-\ning column (Mainieri et al. 2002). Here we explore the role\n\u0001 Based on observations obtained with XMM-Newton, an ESA sci-\nence mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by\nESA Member States and the USA (NASA).\nof the fluorescent Fe line. A possibility to detect a feature in\nthe cosmic spectrum arising from the Fe line has been first\nstudied by Schwartz (1988), where narrow Fe lines were as-\nsumed. However, a diversity in line shapes have been recently\nreported, as relativistic iron lines have been discovered in some\nobjects with ASCA (Tanaka et al. 1995) and confirmed with\nXMM-Newton (Wilms et al. 2001; Fabian et al. 2002a). The\nmost recent evidence is controversial. Only a small fraction\nof Seyfert galaxies seems to emit relativistic iron lines (Boller\net al., in preparation; Balestra et al. 2004) and the line shapes\nobserved with XMM-Newton and Chandra are more compli-\ncated. Frequently a narrow component is observed in the Fe\nline and the analysis of the broad, relativistic component is\noften hampered by systematic uncertainties in modelling the\ncontinuum.\nIn this paper we have used the longest and most sensi-\ntive observation of the X-ray background by XMM-Newton,\na 770 ks observation in the Lockman Hole (Hasinger 2004).\nThe fraction of optically identified sources with redshifts and a\nsufficient number of X-ray photons is quite high in this field, so\nthat for the first time we are able to analyse the mean rest-frame\nspectra for a representative sample of type-1 and type-2 AGN\nat considerable redshifts. We find significant features in the av-\nerage rest frame spectra: a broad line, with a peak at \u223c6.4 keV\nfor the mean spectrum of type-1 AGN and a broad line, possi-\nble with a superposed narrow line with a peak at 6.4 keV for\nArticle published by EDP Sciences and available at http:\/\/www.aanda.org or http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1051\/0004-6361:20041977\n396 A. Streblyanska et al.: Fe line in type-1\/2 AGNs\nthe mean type-2 spectrum. We model the broad component as\na relativistically broadened fluorescent Fe line from the accre-\ntion disk around the Kerr (rotating) black hole (Laor 1991) with\nan equivalent width of \u223c560 eV and \u223c460 eV for the average\nspectrum of type 1 and 2 AGN, respectively.\nThe paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 describes the\nobservations, Sect. 3 the results of spectral analysis, with a dis-\ncussion of the results presented in Sect. 4. We summarize in\nSect. 5.\n2. XMM-Newton observations and data reduction\nThe X-ray results reported in this paper are obtained from\nXMM-Newton observations of the Lockman Hole field, a spe-\ncial region in the sky with a extremely low Galactic hydrogen\ncolumn density, NH = 5.7 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22122 (Lockman et al. 1986).\nThe field was centered on the sky position RA 10:52:43\nand Dec +57:28:48 (J2000) and observed during the three pe-\nriods in 2000, 2001 and 2002 (PV, AO-1 and AO-2 phases).\nThe remaining exposure time after cleaning from high back-\nground periods is approximately 770 ks. The PN and MOS data\nwere preprocessed by the XMM Survey Science Centre with the\nXMM standard Science Analysis System (SAS, version 5.3.3)\nroutines, using the latest calibration data. We have derived the\nevent files from the 16 individual observations of the Lockman\nHole in the standard way (see Worsley et al. 2004).\nSource and background spectra and the response matrices,\narf and rmf, have been extracted for each source and each in-\ndividual observation. The evselect tool is used to extract the\nspectrum and background region, which is defined as an annu-\nlus around the source, after masking out nearby sources. MOS1\nplus MOS2 and independently pn source and background spec-\ntra and response matrices were combined for each source.\nBefore spectral fitting, all spectra are binned with a minimum\nof 30 counts per bin in order to be able to apply the \u03c72 mini-\nmization technique. In this process, the background count rate\nis rescaled with the ratio of the source and background areas.\n2.1. X-ray sample\nImages, background maps and exposure maps were gener-\nated for each observation and detector individually in the\nstandard 5 energy bands: 0.2\u20130.5, 0.5\u20132, 2\u20134.5, 4.5\u20137.5 and\n7.5\u201312 keV. We ran the SAS source detection algorithm\neboxdetect-emldetect on each instrument independently, using\nthe five energy bands simultaneously. Afterwards we cross-\ncorrelated the pn source list with the lists obtained for MOS1\nand MOS2 to build a complete unique catalogue of sources. As\na last step we also cross-check our catalogue with the source\ncatalogue by Mainieri et al. (2002) from the PV observation.\nWe selected a sample of 104 X-ray sources spectroscop-\nically identified by Lehmann et al. (2001) and some addi-\ntional spectroscopic redshifts for new XMM-Newton sources\nobtained at the Keck telescope in 2003 (Lehmann et al. 2005)\nwith counts larger than 200 in the 0.2\u201310 keV band. The bulk\nof the source identification comes from the flux limited ROSAT\n0.5\u20132 keV sample. Most of these sources have been analysed\nindividually by Mainieri et al. (2002). Mateos et al. (2005)\nFig. 1. Redshift distribution of the LH X-ray sources in our selected\nsample. The black and grey lines correspond to type-1 and type-2\nAGN, respectively. Among type-2 AGNs, the objects at low redshifts\n(z < 1) constitute 57%.\npresent a detailed individual spectral analysis of the brightest\nsources, using the same data utilized in this paper.\nIn the following we will refer to type-1 and type-2 objects\nusing the optical spectroscopic classification (see Schmidt et al.\n1998; Lehmann et al. 2001). Our final sample includes 53 type-\n1 AGN, 41 type-2 AGN and 10 galaxies. Throughout the paper,\nerrors correspond to the 90% confidence level for one interest-\ning parameter (\u2206\u03c72 = 2.706).\n3. Results\n3.1. Spectral analysis\nThe redshift distribution of the sources in our sample in shown\nin Fig. 1 and peaks at redshifts below 1 for type-2 AGN and\nclose to 2 for type-1 AGN.\nWe used XSPEC (v11.2) for the spectral fitting analysis.\nAll spectra have been extracted in the 0.2\u201310 keV band, MOS1\nand MOS2 spectra have been merged. For every source we use\na separate response matrix and ancillary response files, where\na change in the filter between the observations is propagated as\ndescribed in Mateos et al. (2005).\nFor every object in our sample we fit the spectrum with a\nsingle power law model modified by an intrinsic absorption,\nhaving the slope of the power law, its normalization and the\nabsorbing column as free parameters. We save the ratio of the\ndata to the model as well as a reconstructed unfolded spectrum.\nThe next step consists of shifting the spectrum to the rest frame.\nFor the ratio we simply increase the energies by the factor of\n(1 + z), while for the unfolded spectra, we use the 2\u201310 keV\nrest frame energy band to renormalize the spectra to the same\nvalue for further averaging.\nAs the redshifts of the sources vary, their rest frame spec-\ntra have different energy boundaries. To provide an average\nA. Streblyanska et al.: Fe line in type-1\/2 AGNs 397\nFig. 2. The resulting ratio plots from mean unfolded spectra type-\n1 AGN spectra obtained by using averaging methods. The unfolded\nspectra are fit with a simple power-law model in the ranges 0.2\u20133 and\n8\u201320 keV (excluding the portion of the spectrum where the emission\nassociated with the relativistic Fe line is present). The EPIC-pn (grey)\nand MOS (black) spectral data show a clear broad excess at 4\u20138 keV\nin the rest-frame.\nspectrum, we select a common energy grid. We used a bin\nwidth of 0.25 keV for energies lower than 8 keV and a bin\nwidth 2 keV above. Such a choice is determined by the avail-\nable counts. In a separate analysis, to study the Fe line profile\nin more detail, we rebinned the data using a binsize of 0.23 keV\nbetween 4 and 7 keV for the type-1 AGN spectra.\nAs the input spectra often have energy bins spread over two\nor more energy bins of the output spectrum, in such instance\nwe use the Monte-Carlo method to choose the bin into which\nto add the data. As a final operation, we normalize the flux in\neach energy bin of the output spectrum by the number of points\nthat were added to it. We propagate the errors accordingly.\nSuch an averaging is similar between the ratio and the un-\nfolded spectra and both methods yield comparable results. As\nlong as the redshifts of the objects in our sample are of order 1,\nit is possible to observe the rest frame averaged spectrum above\n12 keV.\nThe averaged spectra for both type-1 and type-2 AGN show\na prominent spectral feature at 6.4 keV. We observed an excess\nin the data\/model ratio between 4\u20137 keV for the both type-1\nand type-2 AGN (Figs. 2 and 3).\nSuch a feature can be due either to a broad emission line\nor to complex absorption. For the latter we have modelled the\nspectrum in terms of a partially-covered source (e.g. Boller\net al. 2003) and obtain a good fit for the following parame-\nters: \u0393 = 2+0.06\u22120.05, NH = 14\n+2\n\u22122 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 and covering fraction\n= 0.4+0.05\u22120.05. Such a strong partial-covering is usually not seen in\nnearby sources and to observe it in the average spectrum would\nrequire the individual sources to be very similar to each other.\nA variability analysis of the individual source components may\nbe a useful test. In the remainder of this paper we explore the\nbroad emission line interpretation.\nFig. 3. The 0.2\u20133 and 8\u201320 keV power-law model fits for the PN\n(grey), MOS (black) spectral data, showing a broad excess similar to\ntype-1 AGN but in conjunction with a narrow component near 6.4 keV.\n3.2. Origin of the broad line feature in the type-1 AGN\nspectrum\nThe energy of this broad line indicates that Fe atoms respon-\nsible for the line are in a low ionization state, with mean en-\nergy near 6.4 keV (in the rest-frame). Most probably such a\nbroad and intense Fe K\u03b1 line is due to low (moderate) ion-\nization states of iron (i.e., <Fe XVI). The line shape appears\nto be as predicted from disk theory and skewed toward ener-\ngies lower than the rest energy of the emission line. The sim-\nplest interpretation of the skewed shape of the line is that it is\ndue to Doppler and gravitational redshifts from the deep grav-\nitational potential (the inner parts of a disc around a massive\nblack hole). A strong red wing is indicative of gravitational red-\nshifts close to a central black hole, and accretion disk models\nprovide an excellent description of the data. Such line profile\ncan be fitted with a relativistic profile from an accretion disc\naround either a Schwarzschild (non-rotating) or a Kerr (rotat-\ning) black hole (XSPEC models diskline and laor, respec-\ntively; Fabian et al. 1989; Laor 1991).\nIn both models we fixed the line energy to 6.4 keV and the\nemissivity index (\u22122 for diskline and 3 for laor) and fitted\nthe rest of parameters: inner Rin and outer Rout radii and incli-\nnation angle of the disc i (see Table 1). The results for the incli-\nnation angle are close to the standard value of 30 deg observed\nfor a wide sample of AGN, consistent with the sharp drop near\n7 keV and observed peak around the rest energy (6.4 keV).\nThe laor and diskline model yield similar reduced \u03c72\u03bd ,\nbut the disk line model, at least for type-1 AGN spectra prefers\nan inner disk radius at the last stable orbit and an unreasonably\nsmall outer radius.\nIn order to estimate the errors for the equivalent widths, we\nassumed the relative errors to be the same as that of the line\nflux, because the errors in the continuum at the position of the\nFe line are negligible compared to this. It was found to have an\naverage equivalent width of 560+90\u2212110 eV (laor model).\n398 A. Streblyanska et al.: Fe line in type-1\/2 AGNs\nFig. 4.

From our model fits, we computed\nthe slope of a power law spectrum (photon index \u0393), a intrinsic column density NH and the line parameters.\nModel Parameter\nType-1 AGN\n\u0393 NH Energy EW \u03c3 Rin Rout \u03b2 i \u03c72\u03bd \/d.o.f.\ncm\u22122 keV eV keV Rg Rg deg\nGaussian 1.75+0.02\u22120.02 7.9+0.9\u22120.6 \u00d7 1020 5.9+0.2\u22120.1 420+35\u221230 0.69+0.05\u22120.05 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 1.35\/68\ndiskline 1.73+0.02\u22120.01 7.5+1\u22121 \u00d7 1020 6.40\u2217 480+60\u221260 \u2212 6.4+1.8\u22120.4 22+6\u22123 2\u2217 29.1+3.2\u22120.9 0.70\/67\nlaor 1.74+0.01\u22120.02 7.5+1.0\u22120.9 \u00d7 1020 6.40\u2217 560+90\u2212110 \u2212 3.1+1.2\u22120.8 400\u2212120 3\u2217 29.6+1.8\u22121.7 0.73\/67\nType-2 AGN\n\u0393 NH Energy EW \u03c3 Rin Rout \u03b2 i \u03c72\u03bd \/d.o.f.\ncm\u22122 keV eV keV Rg Rg deg\nGaussian 1.59+0.02\u22120.01 5.1+0.9\u22120.8 \u00d7 1020 6.34+0.03\u22120.03 280+25\u221215 0.27+0.04\u22120.02 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 0.83\/64\ndiskline 1.59+0.01\u22120.01 5.0+0.8\u22120.9 \u00d7 1020 6.40\u2217 320+25\u221230 \u2212 6.0+0.1 800+400\u2212360 2\u2217 33.2+1.4\u22122.2 0.80\/63\nlaor 1.61+0.02\u22120.01 5.3+0.9\u22120.8 \u00d7 1020 6.40\u2217 455+45\u221230 \u2212 6.2+1.5\u22120.2 400\u2212100 3\u2217 30.1+0.6\u22121.8 0.66\/63\n\u2217 Fixed\n3.3. Type-2 AGN\nOur initial fit for the unfolded spectrum was an absorbed power\nlaw with a Gaussian component to represent the iron line.\nMoreover we used, as for type-1 AGN spectra, disk line mod-\nels to fit our asymmetric line profiles. Disk line models pro-\nvide a good fit to the red wing of the data. Results are shown\nin Table. 1. As an additional test, we use an additional zero-\nwidth Gaussian to fit a possible narrow line component in the\nFe emission separately, which could come from reflection in\nmaterial much further away from the accretion disk, e.g. in the\ntorus, but this does not improve our \u03c72\u03bd significantly and there-\nfore we neglect this Gaussian.\nThe unfolded spectrum for the type-2 AGN with skewed\nline wings looks similar to that of the type-1 AGN, except\nthat an additional narrow iron line component at a rest energy\n\u223c6.4 keV seems to be present in the type-2 AGN.\nAgain, we assumed the relative error of the equivalent\nwidth to be that of the line flux. It was found to have an av-\nerage equivalent width of 455+45\u221230 eV (laor model).\n4. Discussion\nA Doppler-broadened line with a full width at half-maximum,\nFWHM \u223c 150 000 km s\u22121 can only be produced in the inner\nregion of a relativistic accretion flow by fluorescence (Fabian\net al. 2002a). The observed FWHM and EW is larger than the\naverage value found in Seyfert 1 galaxies (\u223c500 eV, e.g. Nandra\net al. 1997), but similar to the FWHM of some of the bright-\nest nearby active galaxies (for example, to MCG-6-30-15 with\nz = 0.007749).\nOne of the explanations for the large EWs for these ob-\njects can be given by a model including ionized disc reflection\nwith lines and edges from different ionization stages of iron\nA. Streblyanska et al.: Fe line in type-1\/2 AGNs 399\nblurred together by relativistic effects (Ross & Fabian 1993;\nFabian et al. 2002b). In this model, the value of the Fe abun-\ndance determines the relative importance of the line complex in\nrespect to the comptonization bump, seen at energies exceed-\ning 10 keV. Since the observed equivalent width of the broad Fe\nline is high, while the amplitude of a possible reflection com-\nponent observed above 10 keV is small, this model yields a\nhigh Fe abundance as an explanation of the observation. This\nis in fact a novel method of measuring Fe abundance in QSO\nat X-rays, which in addition to the determination of redshifts\nwill allow future X-ray surveys to give insight in the chemi-\ncal evolution of the host environment of QSO. This model has\nbeen applied for several nearby objects and can account for all\nthe observed spectral features, but yields a large iron overabun-\ndance of 3\u20137 \u00d7 solar (Tanaka et al. 2004; Boller et al. 2003). In\nour sample we also most likely obtain the large EW as the re-\nsult of a high metallicity. To test this idea, we used the blurred\nionised reflection models (Ross & Fabian 1993) with an iron\nabundance of 3\u00d7 solar (as needed for MCG-6-30-15) in order\nto obtain a high EW. The results describe our data very well.\nAn additional reason why our large equivalent width may\nbe connected with a large metallicity is that most of our ob-\njects are quite distant and rather luminous AGNs. As shown\nby Shemmer et al. (2004), the metallicity is correlated with the\naccretion rate, which is in turn related to the luminosity. It is\npossible that the large equivalent widths are representative of a\nhigh metallicity, since these objects are both distant and lumi-\nnous.\nOur results are most consistent with a Laor model with\ninner disk radius well inside the maximum stable orbit for\na Schwarzschild black hole, implying that the average X-ray\nbright AGN should contain rotating Kerr BH at their centres1.\nIf this is the case, it implies that the spin will affect demo-\ngraphic arguments relating the AGN luminosity function to the\nmass function of remnant black holes in nearby glaxies (So\u0142tan\n1982) since the radiative efficiency of accretion will increase.\nIndeed, this is postulated by recent work updating the So\u0142tan\nargument with modern galaxy \u2013 black hole correlation func-\ntions and AGN energetics based on hard X-ray surveys (Yu\n& Tremaine 2002; Elvis et al. 2002; Marconi et al. 2004).\nAccretion is expected to build massive black holes with signif-\nicant spin (Hughes & Blandford 2003; Volonteri et al. 2004).\nThe intensity of the relativistic line in our mean spec-\ntra implies that this line must be present in the majority of\nAGN in our sample. Using a similar technique we followed\nthe same procedure with a source list and spectra from the\nXMM-Newton observation of the Chandra Deep Field South\n(Streblyanska et al. 2004). The results are consistent with our\nanalysis of the LH and also with an independent analysis of\nthe Chandra deep field data by Brusa et al. (2005). We also\n1 The Laor (1991) model which is appropriate for spin a\/m = 0.998\ngives a best fit Rin = 3. Dovc\u02c7iak et al. (2003) plot the maximum red-\nshift as a function of radius and spin (their Fig. 2).

For this pur-\npose we applied a \u03c3-clipping before averaging our spectral\nbins, but the resulting spectra do not differ significantly.\nIn future work we plan to investigate the dependence of the\nline on other parameters, such as redshift or luminosity. We will\nalso consider a composite model with a range of inclinations.\n5. Conclusions\nThis work includes analysis of EPIC-pn and MOS1\/2 data. We\npresent results of the X-ray spectral analysis of the 770 ks\ndeep survey observations obtained with XMM-Newton on the\nLockman Hole. We have derived the average X-ray spectral\nproperties of sources spectroscopically identified with the Keck\ntelescopes. With data from the EPIC-pn and MOS detectors,\nwe used a sample of 104 sources with redshift identification\nand photon counts >200. We used an averaging technique to\ndetermine average spectra of the different AGN populations.\nWe parameterize the spectrum with a simple power law model.\nThe continuum at 4\u20137 keV shows residuals above the power-\nlaw model, suggesting the presence of a strong broad feature,\nmost likely a relativistic iron disk line. In the mean spectra of\ntype-1 and type-2 AGN we find evidence for a broad line at\nrest-frame energy \u223c 6.4 keV with EW \u223c 560 eV and \u223c460 eV\n(laor model), respectively. We interpret this line as the fluores-\ncent Fe K\u03b1 line commonly observed in Seyfert galaxies. Our\nmean spectrum for the type-2 AGN indicates in addition to the\nbroad line a narrow component.\nThe most interesting conclusions which follow from our\nanalysis are:\nThe average rest-frame spectrum of the XRB sources shows\na strong, relativistic iron line, possibly due to a high metallic-\nity in the average population. The strong red wing of the line\nfeature indicates some component of spin in the average black\nhole.\nA very broad line feature is expected in the average X-ray\nbackground spectra (Fabian et al. 2000; Gilli et al. 2001), which\nshould be included in future population synthesis models for\nthe X-ray background.\nIn spite of the variety and complexity of Fe features at low z\nbright objects (both type-1 and type-2 Seyfert), the average line\nshape at higher redshift is consistent with a relativistic disk line\nfor type-1 and type-2 AGN with some evidence of an additional\nnarrow component for type-2 AGN.\nThese findings strongly reinforce the science case of the\nXEUS\/Constellation-X mission; with the very large collecting\narea we can expect to measure the relativistic Fe line parame-\nters of individual objects out to very high redshifts (z \u2248 10) and\nexplore the evolution of black hole spin.\nAcknowledgements.
