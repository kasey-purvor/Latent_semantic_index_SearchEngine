It was prompted \nby reflections that arose over the years as I listened to papers at academic conferences and \nread books and articles.  I was struck not only by how temporal lacunae seem to permeate \nwhat passes for warranted scholarly knowledge, but also by how successive generations of \nthinkers have for no apparent reason been anathematized.  Redolent of a process described \nby Sorokin as the workings of \u2018amnesia and discoverer\u2019s complex\u2019, a process that contrib-\nuted to \u2018an extreme scarcity of references to the basic works of . . . predecessors\u2019 in sociol-\nogy at large, including, he noted, himself (Sorokin 1956: 7,18), many authors who pub-\nlished their work in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s seem simply to have disappeared \nfrom contemporary intellectual consciousness, sometimes to be displaced by others, more \nrecent and not always of equal merit, who have been credited with originating their ideas.  \nCriminology has proceeded in a series of fits, being marked by radical discontinuities; a \nrecurrence of new beginnings; and a quest for the seemingly distinctive, influenced, per-\nhaps, by what the himself now-neglected Jack Douglas once called \u2018simplificationism\u2019:  \n\u2018the modern scientists\u2019 self-imposed professional myopia, the insistence of each specialist \n 2 \non seeing everything as caused by the few particular variables he happens to \u2018own\u2019 profes-\nsionally . . . . \u2018  (Douglas, Rasmussen and Flan 1977:  51).   Sorokin\u2019s and Douglas\u2019 claim \nthat disciplines tend to forget their past was later to be given a title by Saul Morson \u2013 \nchronocentrism \u2013 the unsubstantiated, often uninspected, almost certainly untenable but \npowerful doctrine that what is current must somehow be superior to what went before, that \nideas, scholars and scholarship inevitably become stale and discredited over time, and that, \nby implication, those who invoke older work must themselves become contaminated by the \ntaint of staleness (Morson 1996:  278-82).  \u2018Chronocentrism\u2019, he wrote, comes \u2018most readi-\nly to groups that imagine they possess wisdom . . . superior to that of their own predeces-\nsors\u2019 (Morson 1995: 9).   \n \nMorson did not expand his concept at all fully, and this paper should be read as an attempt \nto develop it empirically.  I shall employ it to describe the state of criminology in Britain - \nand sociological criminology in particular, the branch of the discipline with which I am \nmost familiar - although what follows may well be true of other disciplines elsewhere.  The \npaper proceeds by citation research and by interview and email correspondence with prac-\ntising criminologists in England and Wales, all of whom agreed to be quoted either by \nname or anonymously, and I shall make use of those interviews and emails as the argument \nunfolds.1   \n \nChronocentric criminology \nIn an email, Adam Crawford observed of chronocentrism that there is \u2018a (rather sloppy) \ntheoretical assumption that underpins some criminological and social science research that \nwe live in \u201cnew times\u201d (be it post-modernity, post-Fordism or whatever) that demand new \nconcepts, ideas, understandings. This tends to suggest a rupture with the past and hence ef-\n 3 \nfaces historic continuities.\u2019   Durkheim, Merton and the Matza of \u2018Techniques of Neutrali-\nzation\u2019 and Delinquency and Drift (but not the Matza of Becoming Deviant) may have sur-\nvived as ancestral figures, but few now seem to talk of Harold Garfinkel2 or Joseph Gus-\nfield.3  Alfred Lindesmith, Hermann Mannheim, Walter Reckless, Thomas Scheff, Robert \nScott, James Short, Paul Tappan and others have been obscured.  Work on the social pro-\nduction of official crime statistics now returns to Michel Foucault and blots out what might \nwell have been defined as the earlier and more pivotal work of Aaron Cicourel, John \nKitsuse, David Sudnow and Jack Douglas.4  The ethnomethodology and phenomenology of \ncrime, deviance and control have apparently been expunged.  Symbolic interactionism has \nbeen over-shadowed, but an odd entity called \u2018social constructionism\u2019 has appeared in its \nstead.5  Many of those identified by Hermann Mannheim (1960b), Piers Beirne (1993, \n1994) and David Garland (2002) as the \u2018founding fathers\u2019 of the discipline have been dis-\nowned (no doubt, it must be said, perfectly justly in many cases) and they include Andr\u00e9-\nMichel Guerry, Adolphe Quetelet and Gabriel Tarde. \n \nTo be sure, there is not much of a case to be made for sociological criminology becoming \nakin to the Royal College of Heralds, ceaselessly poring over its pedigrees.  Neither is it \nfeasible or necessary always to give full acknowledgement to every precedent and ancestor.  \nLike Funes (Borges 1998: 96), any discipline that retained too perfect a memory of its past \nwould become mired in a chronicling of the particular, working in an eternal present, never \nable to rise to a plane of useful reflection, abstraction and synthesis   David Downes ob-\nserved of that tension in referencing between the incomplete and the too-complete that \u2018it\u2019s \na very difficult balance to achieve between neglecting what\u2019s important in previous work . . \n. and going in for a kind of monumental attempt to recall, total recall, citing everything \n 4 \nthat\u2019s ever been written about a particular subject and . . . having some kind of encyclopae-\ndic set of references.\u2019  \n \nThe literature of criminology has now grown so elephantine that there may have been an \nincreasing and necessary resort to the lexical short cut or bibliographic shorthand, to what \nDeclan Roche, also in interview, called \u2018finding a good, recent article in a good journal\u2019.  \nSome pieces of writing may indeed be so original or novel in their ideas or empirical con-\ntent that they really do have few precursors.  Ideas shift.  Data lose relevance.6  Technical \nmethods are superseded.  Writers may wish to engage with policy issues of the moment.  \nLines of argument fork or become sterile (Nigel Fielding remarked, for instance, that it is \nno bad thing that the search for a monocausal explanation of crime has been abandoned, \nunlikely ever to be resuscitated7).  Bibliographic data bases have their temporal limitations \n(the electronic catalogues of the library of the Cambridge Institute of Criminology and the \nBritish Library of Political and Economic Science do not extend back beyond 1973,8 for \ninstance, although the patterns I describe were apparent before they came into use).  And \nworks may be credited with their date of re-publication or translation rather than their orig-\ninal date of issue (Durkheim, for example, appeared five times in the citation survey pre-\npared for this paper, and only once was the original publication dates of his books in France \ngiven).   \n \nBut that is not elucidation enough.  Amnesia does seem to be such a real force, leading as it \ndoes to the methodical extinction of many ideas and authors beyond a certain age, that I \nwas moved to explore the matter empirically, and what I offer now is an attempt as much to \nexpose questions as to resolve them.   \n 5 \nA Citation Survey \nThe obvious area to begin the exploration of such matters was citation practices, \u2018criminol-\nogy in general lives on journal articles\u2019 (Katz and Jackson-Jacobs 2004:  114), and the ob-\nvious journal to explore for a criminologist working in the UK is The British Journal of \nCriminology,9 an international journal with what has been called a \u2018strong UK compo-\nnent.\u201910  Citation research has in the past been geared conventionally to ranking scholars \nand journals in hierarchies of esteem and influence for purposes of comparison and assess-\nment.11  One early piece of research (that did not touch on criminology) noted without \ncomment the tendency for the age-distribution of citations to be arrayed in a pattern that \nconforms to a J-shaped curve (Nicholas, Ritchie and Ritchie 1978: 46-7).  However I know \nof no extended link that has yet been made between that pattern and the shaping of what is \naccepted as memorable scholarship in criminology or any other discipline.   \n \nThe dates of all citations were plotted for the first volume of The British Journal of Crimi-\nnology, issued in 1960, and for subsequent volumes at ten-yearly intervals thereafter until \n2000.12  Citations were also charted for the inaugural 1951 volume of the journal\u2019s fore-\nrunner, The British Journal of Delinquency.  And the ensuing patterns are revealing.  They \nsuggest that, although there may have been an ever-growing universe of works published in \ncriminology, and although the number of citations may have increased and the content of \npapers may have changed over time, the formal character of the age distribution of publica-\ntions cited was remarkably stable.  It too followed a pronounced J-shaped curve.  There is a \nrelatively invariant pattern:  the J-shaped insignia was quite as strong in the 1951 volume \nwith its mere 195 references as in the 2000 volume with its 1873 references.  Criminologi-\ncal citation practices are not new and they cannot be explained, say, merely by the expan-\n 6 \nsion of the discipline.  They seem instead to reflect a fixed form, habit or cast of the aca-\ndemic mind.  \n \n \n \n \n \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n18\n36\n18\n46\n18\n56\n18\n66\n18\n76\n18\n86\n18\n96\n19\n06\n19\n16\n19\n26\n19\n36\n19\n46\n19\n55\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure I:  Citations in The British Journal of Delinquency 1951 (n-195) \n \n \n \n \n 7 \n \n \nFigure II:  Citations in The British Journal of Criminology 1960 (n-131) \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n18\n36\n18\n46\n18\n56\n18\n66\n18\n76\n18\n86\n18\n96\n19\n06\n19\n16\n19\n26\n19\n36\n19\n46\n19\n55\n \n \n \n \nFigure III:  Citations in The British Journal of Criminology 1970 (n-320) \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n             \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n18\n90\n19\n00\n19\n10\n19\n20\n19\n30\n19\n40\n19\n50\n19\n60\n19\n70\n 8 \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure IV:  Citations in The British Journal of Criminology 1980 (n-619) \n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n18\n90\n19\n00\n19\n10\n19\n20\n19\n30\n19\n40\n19\n50\n19\n60\n19\n70\n19\n80\n \nFigure V:  Citations in The British Journal of Criminology 1990 (n-\n892) \n \n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\n400\n18\n90\n19\n00\n19\n10\n19\n20\n19\n30\n19\n40\n19\n50\n19\n60\n19\n70\n19\n80\n19\n90\n \n \n \n \n \n 9 \n \n \nFigure VI:  Citations in The British Journal of Criminology 2000 (n-1873) \n*1605-1760 is not grouped by 5 years-only one frequency \n \n \n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n16\n05\n17\n75\n17\n95\n18\n15\n18\n35\n18\n55\n18\n75\n18\n95\n19\n15\n19\n35\n19\n55\n19\n75\n19\n95\n20\n20\n \n \n \n \nAn examination of who and what were most commonly cited over the decades prompts an \nobvious explanation of part of that configuration:  the paradigmatic revolutions to which \ncriminology is so prone induce rapid jumps and discontinuities in referencing patterns.  \nHans Eysenck was one of the two equally most frequently cited authors of all across the \nentire period, attracting 28 references, but the citations referring to his work were clumped \ntogether in the 1960 (6) and 1970 (22) volumes and none appeared in the volumes sampled \nthereafter.  The other most frequently cited author, David Garland, accumulated 6 refer-\nences in 1990 and 22 in 2000, but none before (and his first published book, a co-edited \nvolume, appeared in 1983 (Garland and Young 1983)).  The next most often cited author, \n \n \n \n \n 10 \nJohn Braithwaite, received 1 reference in 1980, 9 in 1990 and 17 in 2000, and the work that \nwon him the widest criminological acclaim was published in 1989 (Braithwaite 1989).  Au-\nthors and their books will have their day, and the former stars of citation reviews can wane:  \nJohn Bowlby (esp. 1946 and  1951), cited seven times, but not later than 1970; Cyril Burt \n(esp. 1944) cited six times, twice in 1951, thrice in 1970, and once in 1980, but not thereaf-\nter; W.N. East (for example, 1939), cited three times but not later than 1960; and Trevor \nGibbens (e.g. 1963), cited four times but not after 1980, are clear instances.  They once \nhelped to define the field in England and Wales and are now no more.  Although a few de-\nfied that trend,13 the age distribution of citations inevitably reflects the timing of when ide-\nas entered the stream of thought, influenced writing and were then abandoned in tandem \nwith the discipline\u2019s changing preoccupations.   \n \nNo doubt, too, older books and journals may have become less accessible over time,14 and \nthere will be a tendency for authors to turn to what is at hand.  Yet fluctuations in research \nfoci, theoretical trend, empirical relevance and the accessibility of materials do not wholly \nexplain the pronounced emphasis on the new.  Neither does the sheer expansion of crimi-\nnology, because the curves are invariant over time, irrespective of the mass of writings in \nthe field at any one moment.  If the raw shape of those curves does not speak for itself, I \nconcluded that it would be profitable first to turn to indicative interviews with a sample of \ncriminological colleagues (three women and four men, four of whom were relatively jun-\nior, three relatively senior) in the LSE to establish what personal gloss they would them-\nselves place upon their own and others\u2019 citation practices, and then to consult more broadly \nby email with ten criminologists at different universities across the UK.15   Their replies \nrevealed that citation practices could be complex, personal and idiosyncratic, partly be-\ncause the practices do not seem always to be reflexive; partly because there is an unre-\n 11 \nsolved ambivalence about how evidence should best be deployed; partly because, as a re-\nsult, citation appears to be an ad hoc procedure; and partly because there appears to be no \nformal schooling in the art and etiquette of referencing procedure other than, say, in the use \nof the Harvard system or its competitors.  One of those former colleagues, Declan Roche, \nsaid \u2018it\u2019s made me think about something that I\u2019ve done probably quite subconsciously, \nunconsciously, in that you just gravitate towards the recent stuff\u2019.  Stephanie Hayman, ex-\nperienced in the field but only recently awarded a doctorate, observed that amongst her fel-\nlow research students citation procedure \u2018was never discussed.  . . . I think there\u2019s a very \ngood case [that] could be made for making students much more aware of how they use cita-\ntions, good practice, etc. etc.\u2019  And Coretta Phillips said \u2018I\u2018ve never talked to anybody \nabout it . . .  explicitly.\u2019 \n \nColleagues tended to maintain that they themselves were not prey to neophilia and that the \npractice lay elsewhere.   One younger criminologist said \u2018I tend to . . . read too much per-\nhaps and try and select too much when I\u2019m referring to something, to show that . . . I\u2019ve \ncovered all of the bases. . . . I still feel like I\u2019m learning in a sense and I think probably \nwhat I\u2019ve tended to do is . . . assume that I need to try almost every source, basic, historical \nand contemporary, and really to . . .  over-reference probably.\u2019   And another claimed that \nshe wished to show in her citations that \u2018I\u2019m not guilty of plagiarism\u2019, that others concurred \nwith her arguments, and that, \u2018aware of the historic literature\u2019, she had returned to the old-\nest original sources and the more important writings that peppered the development of an \nidea .  She was in a \u2018small [research] pond\u2019 and was \u2018in a much stronger position to make \njudgments about utility than if you\u2019re swimming in a much larger volume of water and you \nmay choose more superficial criteria.\u2019 \u2018Recency,\u2019 she said, did not imply \u2018anything to me.  \nRecency implies that I\u2019m trying to keep abreast of what is being said but it doesn\u2019t mean \n 12 \nthat it\u2019s any more important than what has gone before.\u2019  Robert Reiner too talked of his \nhaving been steeped in the Talmudic tradition in which one should never \u2018fail to attribute \nideas to where you first came across them and, since in fact there is virtually nothing, prob-\nably nothing new under the sun, the truth is that all of us are constantly repackaging . . . and \nthinking again . . . ideas that we actually came across in a different context.  I\u2019m driven \nmore by the fear that I won\u2019t attribute, that I\u2019ll appear to be plagiarising, stealing ideas and \nso on . . .\u201916   \n \nIf their professed practice had been widespread, one might have expected the spread of ci-\ntations over time to be relatively flat; gradually declining with age; or bi-polar, with a dis-\nproportion of references to foundational works, on the one hand, and to recent works, on \nthe other (leading to what might crudely be represented as \u2018\u2014\u2018, \u2018\/\u2019, \u2018V\u2019, \u2018W\u2019 or \u2018U\u2019-shaped \ncurves over time), but it was not, and their scholarly procedures, whilst admirable, do not \nseem to have been commonly emulated in the discipline (a criminologist at another univer-\nsity did conjecture that \u2018I can\u2019t help thinking that some of what some of your interviewees \narticulate is what we \u2018should do\u2019, not what we \u2018actually do!\u2019\u2019)  Rather, there was a perva-\nsive ambivalence that was a contradictory meld of a respect for scholarly tradition (and, \nwith it, a sense of the defining articles that give an agreed structure, sometimes almost irre-\nspective of content, to the history of ideas17) and an apprehension that the new has its own \nself-conferring legitimacy.  A colleague said for instance: \n\u2018Would I be worried if I didn\u2019t [cite] anything over the last decade?  I\u2019d only be wor-\nried about it if I felt that there was literature that I\u2019d ignored that was important.    . . .  \nI mean I don\u2019t . . .  look at material on the basis of when it was published.    It has to \nbe on . . .  the merit . . .  of the material.   However, I think it\u2019s also true to say that if I \n 13 \ncan find up-to-date and contemporary things, . . .  I would always . . .  go to what\u2019s \nrecently been written . . . \u2018   \nAlthough the criminologists interviewed claimed always to search the past of an academic \nproblem quite extensively - and wished to be seen to have searched the past - there was also \na concern about not appearing to have neglected what was current and relevant.  The new \nwas deemed generally to supersede the old, and especially where work was embedded in \nthe empirical, as so much criminology tends to be.  The repeated phrase was \u2018not missing \nout\u2019.  One said \u2018I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that the more recent is the superior. . . . .  but . . .  \nyou always feel that you\u2019ve missed something or that you\u2019re not as well read as you should \nbe\u2019 if you do not allude to it.  Another said \u2018I don\u2019t preference things on the basis of the \ntiming when they\u2019re published but I would seek to make sure that I was up to speed with \nwhat was out there at this moment in time.\u2019    And yet another remarked:  \n\u2018I think as a young, or younger [scholar], you worry that you\u2019ll leave something out \nor get something wrong. Reading the latest stuff helps reassure yourself that you\u2019re \ngetting the up-to-date view of the world that you\u2019re writing about.  And also the se-\ncond . . . reason why you might use references that if you\u2019re trying to show that you \nare writing something that\u2019s credible and authoritative, . . . including new references \nsuggests to the reader you\u2019re keeping on top of your field. So I suppose it\u2019s partly \nabout reassuring yourself and partly about reassuring your reader.\u2019   \nTim Newburn reflected that the new: \n\u2018supersedes  some of the things that will have gone before. There may be some sort of \nfoundational pieces which one would refer back to but in relation to empirical re-\nsearch, one would hope, it isn\u2019t always borne out, but that the newer pieces will su-\npersede the earlier ones in a number of ways, bigger samples, better research or simp-\nly more recent research that\u2019s the qualitative equivalent of its predecessor that hap-\n 14 \npens to be of or in a generation that is current, and is indeed what one is talking about \ngenerally.\u2019   \nAnd David Downes said:  \n\u2018I suppose recency is the attempt to show that you\u2019re being up to date, you know, you \nhaven\u2019t missed anything. . . .  I suppose it means that you are aware of the latest \nthinking, as far as you can be, about this particular question.\u2019   \nIt was quite conceivable that there may actually be no recent work in a particular area but, \nwithout current citation, there was the possible risk that \u2018you had missed something signifi-\ncant . . . you always want to be seen as at the cutting edge.\u2019  He acknowledged the assump-\ntion held by some that the new envelops the old, that the \u2018new has the edge on the old be-\ncause it\u2019s got all the advantages of the old incorporated in it.\u2019  And, he continued, extraor-\ndinary reasons may have to be tendered to defend a use of old sources:  \u2018the other day, I \nsaid to a student, you ought to go back to [a book published in 1938] . . . and I felt I had to \ngive a great justification for that, you know, why should he want to go back that far?  Well, \nit seems to me, what [the author] has to say there still has enormous relevance to where we \nare today.\u2019   \n \nStudents, officers regulating what is called \u2018teaching quality assurance\u2019 (or TQA),18 exter-\nnal examiners19 and others were sensed as policing research and teaching and placing some \npressure on criminologists to \u2018keep up to date\u2019.  Nigel Fielding said: \n\u2018Most students still just pester me to tell them which single book to buy so they \ncould pass the course.. . . .  I would suggest that students have an important and \ngenerally negative influence in making lecturers feel guilty about citing \u2018old\u2019 \ncontributions. Behind them stand external examiners and TQA hacks, for whom \nthe most facile piece of \u2018advice\u2019 they can impose is to \u2018bring your reading lists \n 15 \nup to date\u2019. This will be exacerbated by the new pressure to put most of one\u2019s \ncourse materials \u2018on the web\u2019. One has to be quite senior, or seriously stubborn, \nto resist the steady drip of such external impositions.\u2019 \nIt is also perhaps conceivable that such a preoccupation with the recent marks the relative \nabsence of a single, collective scholarly tradition in criminology which all novices are \nobliged to master.  There is no formal accrediting body which controls who can call him-\nself or herself a criminologist.  Criminologists tend to stem from an abundance of scholarly \ndisciplines, occupy what Alison Liebling called ever more \u2018differentiated\/dispersed net-\nworks\u2019, are less and less frequently members of distinct, and well-defined intellectual line-\nages \u2018taught\/supervised by chiefs in the field\u2019, and use different methods to pursue diverse \nproblems.20  And the outcome, Simon Holdaway said, is that \u2018They do not identify their \nresearch as standing within a disciplinary, theoretical tradition that seeks to refine its ideas, \nhas a historical legacy of direct relevance to present work, and understand ideas as part of a \nbody of scholarly knowledge.  The phenomenon of the \u2018jobbing criminologist\u2019, moving \nfrom project to project, with no understanding that their research is rooted in fertile theoret-\nical ground, is not new.\u2019  The more empiricist strands of an empiricist discipline are not \nnecessarily held to need justification in social theory but in \u2018positivist research methods\u2019.21  \n \nIn an occupational setting increasingly governed by performance indicators, the exigencies \nof funding deadlines, and what Alison Liebling called the growing \u2018influence of moderni-\nzation, and the infiltration of business thinking\/management styles into academic life\u2019, \nmany criminologists claim to find it hard to be as leisurely, contemplative or conventional-\nly scholarly as they imagined their precursors to have been in some golden age before the \nimperatives of research contracts and the Research Assessment Exercise.22  Theirs is a \n 16 \nworld of tight timetables, pressing demands and continual haste.  Alison Liebling contin-\nued: \n\u2018 . . .  the mid-career turn to my elders is also happening now because I am \u2018getting \nround to it\u2019 after decades of full-on empirical work with less time for reading than some \nof my older colleagues may have had in the utopian academic past I never experienced. \nI feel it is a luxury to be reading e.g. Bowlby or Ericson in the original because their \nideas are relevant to a report I might be writing (but that is already overdue). I manage \na little more of this these days, but it has taken a long time to reach this point. We seem \nto have made academic life so strenuous (in the name of efficiency and \u2018bringing in \nmoney\u2019) that everything is done against the clock. This may be an important structural \nreason for the general tendency to concentrate on \u2018the apparently essential\u2019.\u2019 \nMore graphic still was Dick Hobbs.  In common with some others of his generation, he \nheld to a Platonic history of ideas in which a prelapsarian age of British criminology ap-\npears to have been rudely abandoned by scholars who are less than scholarly: \n\u2018The sudden growth in British criminology seems to have caught sociology \nunawares...  it seems to have given up [the] sociology of deviance,  \nsociology of crime and control etc. Consequently what has replaced it is  \na bastardized concept of indeterminate lineage based upon populism, pragmatism, and \na commodified notion of knowledge production increasingly driven by an unholy \nalliance of policy makers, publishers and entrepreneurial university administrators.  \nBritish criminological forebears stressed the sociological underpinnings of the study \nof crime and control e.g. positivism, interactionism, phenomenology, ethnomethodol-\nogy etc. Crime\/deviance\/control\/ was part of a wider intellectual project. Increasingly \ncriminology is taught as a discrete discipline bereft of epistemological considerations. \nIf it is the second week in February it must be left realism. A hangover and the funer-\n 17 \nal of a cherished grandparent and both Lombroso and the Chicago School disappear \nup the Swanee. 1973 becomes year zero. Given that criminology degrees are increas-\ningly influenced by policy considerations e.g. \"what works\", forensics, criminal psy-\nchology etc., it is little wonder that what were once thought of as the foundations are \nincreasingly ignored in citations.   This is reinforced by the availability of expertly \nproduced handbooks and textbooks. It is no longer necessary or indeed practical to go \ntrawling through a library to dissect a 1938 text, a one liner in the reference book will \nsuffice before confronting the more immediate concerns of crime surveys, or \nadministrative evaluations. This can lead to an easily learnt citation shorthand. So \nstigma (Goffman), moral panic (Cohen). Criminology is no longer a \nbranch of sociology, it\u2019s karaoke.\u2018 \n \n The phenomenology of citation practices \nStrongly supporting these workings of chronocentrism, it might be supposed, is a more or \nless tacit phenomenology of time, fashion and the half-life of ideas.  Those who write now \nor in the very recent past may well be seen by the criminologist to have an affinity, acces-\nsibility, immediacy, vivacity and openness of thought which cannot be so readily attached \nto the relatively closed life-world of his or her predecessors (Schutz and Luckmann 1974: \n88).  At a distance or immediately, they may be biographically, intellectually and socially \nengaged with the author, and what he or she writes and reads may be read by them and vice \nversa.  They are in that sense part of an assumed and living community of the mind, a cur-\nrent intellectual generation or a working counterpart of a generation, a school or a politics, \nsharing a Weltanschauung or collective experience (Mannheim 1960a: 242), and having \u2018in \ncommon a sector of time which makes it possible for me to act upon them as they may act \nupon me within a communicative environment . . . \u2019  (Schutz 1967: 318).  Reference to \n 18 \nthem can signal that one is an informed and knowing associate of that which is fresh, time-\nly and pressing, not at all lagging behind the movement of ideas, a privileged participant in \na social process in which, as Tarde put it, \u2018the march of imitation from top to bottom . . . \ngoes on\u2019 (Tarde 1969: 190).   \n \nRobert Reiner reflected that \u2018academic life is riddled [by] . . . a love of the new and a wish \nto show that you\u2019re new. . . . there is this constant wish to show that you\u2019re [at] the frontiers \nof knowledge, you\u2019re absolutely up to date with current thinking and so on\u2019.  To be in or \nnear a top or a centre where intellectual innovation is still taking place confers a sense of a \ncloseness to events, of being an insider, of experiencing the still fermenting and the person-\nal before it becomes fusty, formalized, alien, unremarkable, commonplace (see Simmel \n1971: 363), scholastic or even, perhaps, antiquarian.  David Downes remarked that \u2018I have \na great fear of antiquarianism and I think maybe that our generation [of the] 1960s, we \nwere frightened of being just antiquarians . . . . \u2018  And Tim Newburn agreed:  \n\u2018References have a symbolic function as well, which is to say that they indicate that \none is, in theory, up to date, reading broadly, aware of the latest theoretical ideas and \nso on and so forth.  So I think there\u2019s a, without wanting to make it sound overly cyn-\nical, there is obviously a game being played as well with readers and I certainly have \nan eye to what I think is going to be considered to be, others will see as relevant, im-\nportant, necessary in some way. . . . . I would always include more recent citations [to \nshow that I\u2019m] up to speed, aware of current debates in the same way as we, using . . . \nthe Goffmanesque dramaturgical analogy of acting on the stage and so forth, that, as \nin other areas of our life, we\u2019re aware of expectations and the need to try and meet \nthose. And one of the ways we meet the expectations of scholarship apparently, is, I \n 19 \nthink is to show . . . that we\u2019re not just dinosaurs who happen [have] to read things in \nthe [19]80s or the [19]70s or whatever and haven\u2019t kept abreast of developments.\u2019  \nBy extension, and as the editor of a journal himself and a reader of submissions for other \njournals, he would scrutinise the impressions constructed by others in their deployment of \nreferences:23 \n\u2018[I] always look at the citations to get a quick sense of who I think\u2019s written this or in \nwhat style it is and where it sits in relation to other things.  So that citations would af-\nfect my . . . first reaction to a piece quite strongly.  So that if they were all . . . reason-\nably ancient, then I would wonder where this person had been and what they were do-\ning and why it was that there was apparently nothing relevant in the last 10 or 20 \nyears, whatever the period may be.\u2019 \nCitations may not in that sense simply be technical or utilitarian devices but signifiers that \nbear a substantial iconic, existential and social load, signalling something about one\u2019s com-\npetence; who one is; whom one admires; what intellectual groups one claims as one\u2019s own, \nand how one defines their membership and boundaries.24  They are attempts, in other \nwords, symbolically to affirm the importance of people,25 ideas and social worlds.  They \nconvey how one aspires publicly to be defined and placed as an alert and wide-awake per-\nson at the core of the academy.  They create a self and its future trajectory, flagging what, \nas one colleague said, \u2018your life project is . . . it\u2019s a way of signifying that\u2019.   Adam Craw-\nford remarked:  \u2018References are signifiers of identity and belonging, they suggest who we \nreflect who we are and the reference group to which we consider ourselves to belong in our \nintellectual endeavours. These are more likely to be (but not always) the living and our \ncontemporaries.\u2019 \n \n 20 \nIt is perhaps but a step for citations to become features of a social engineering process in \nwhich criminologists individually or in combination more or less deliberately exercise pat-\nronage26 or promote one another in what Nikolas Rose informally called \u2018citation rings or \ncitation cabals.\u201927 Very much to the point, Frances Heidensohn remembered a conversation \nat one of the meetings of the National Deviancy Symposium at the University of York in \nthe early 1970s - the meetings which were to shape so many criminological life-chances.  \nIn that conversation, one sociologist of deviancy was overheard promising another \u2018I\u2019ll \nquote you if you quote me\u2019.28   Scholars may even refer heavily to themselves as they \nclamber up the ranks of citation indices.29  Nikolas Rose remembered: \n\u2018I recall some years ago - when I was at a conference on the history of \nthe human sciences - being amused by a Spanish psychologist and \nhistorian of psychology who used citation indices to study the relative \nimportance of different Spanish psychologists.  He cited his own work \ncopiously in his published pieces, and was surrounded by a strangely \nlarge group of acolytes all of whom also cited him and one another \nprofusely and exclusively - which of course meant that pretty soon he \nwas far up the citation list of the most influential Spanish \npsychologists.\u2019 \nConclusion \nChronocentrism and its allied beliefs must account in part for the pronounced custom in \ncriminology and other disciplines to cite what is recent and neglect what is old.  The matter \nis important because what is named and what overlooked mould what passes for authorita-\ntive learning; the phrasing of problems and the identification of answers; the selection and \nmarshalling of evidence and argument; literary etiquette; the approved history of ideas; \nand, most central to the scholarly project of criminology, the accumulation of knowledge \n 21 \nover time.30  If Max Steuer was right when he said that \u2018science is a structure that is \nworked on for many, many generations\u2019;31 if Nigel Fielding was right when he said that \n\u2018the most damaging thing is that this works against cumulative knowledge, which latter is \nthe mark of a mature science;\u201832 there may be grounds for concern about the enterprise of \ncriminology.   \n \n \nNotes \n* I am grateful to Adam Crawford, David Downes, Nigel Fielding, Janet Foster, \nStephanie Hayman, Dick Hobbs, Simon Holdaway, Jenny Law, Alison Liebling, \nJoyce Lorinstein, Tim Newburn, Coretta Phillips, Michael Prachar, Robert Reiner, \nDeclan Roche, Nikolas Rose, Lucia Zedner and the anonymous reviewers of The Brit-\nish Journal of Sociology for their help in preparing this article.  I am also grateful for \nthe comments of the PhD students of the Cambridge Institute of Criminology to \nwhom I gave this article as a paper in October 2004. \n                                                 \n1 All quotations lacking reference to textual sources should be assumed to stem from \nthose interviews or that correspondence. \n2 Garfinkel baptized ethnomethodology and used it to effect in developing a method-\nology to explore or create marginal situations in which commonplace meanings be-\ncame anthropologically strange. \n3 Gusfield analysed deviance, and particularly drinking, as a cultural construction fab-\nricated in the status politics of America.  It would be possible to catalogue the equally \nvaluable contributions made by the other anathematised authors to criminology and \nthe sociology of deviance, but I wished only to provide illustrations of what has been \nlost. \n 22 \n                                                                                                                                            \n4 In a survey conducted of all citations in the 1951, 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990 and 2000 \nvolumes of The British Journal of Delinquency and The British Journal of Criminolo-\ngy, a survey which we describe at greater length below and which yielded  a total \nsample of 4030 references, there was one reference to Matza\u2019s Becoming Deviant; 1 \nto Aaron Cicourel in 1970; none to Jack Douglas or Harold Garfinkel; 2 (one in 1980 \nand one in 1990) to the works of Joseph Gusfield; 1 to John Kitsuse in 1970; none to \nAlfred Lindesmith; 9 to the works of Hermann Mannheim, but none more recent than \n1980; three to Walter Reckless, but none more recent than 1960; none to Robert Scott; \nnone to Thomas Scheff; 2 to James Short, both in the 1970 volume; and four to Paul \nTappan, none later than 1970. \n5 Nigel Fielding remarked that \u2018The new label is about careers and the need to look \nlike one\u2019s found something new. The new term lacks the virtue of precision, too. \n\u201cConstructionism\u201d is latched onto by students because they have heard the word \u201cde-\nconstruct\u201d, and find the approach appealing because it seems to involve playing with \nwords in the kind of non-validate-able \u201canalysis\u201d that marks cultural and media stud-\nies. Students do not like to be told to look instead at SI, because there they find sys-\ntematic procedures, formal validation criteria, and in some branches, quantification.\u2019 \n6 Adam Crawford observed that \u2018There is a presumed \u201cshelf-life\u201d to empirical re-\nsearch, which suggests that \u201cthings change\u201d, people\u2019s attitudes and behaviour as well \nas professional practice. In some circumstances this may be true. But I also think there \nis an element of self-selection. If in doubt the more recent (so long as it is methodo-\nlogically robust) may be the more empirically relevant, and therefore defendable.\u2019 \n7  Although he may have been a little too sanguine.  Some do still search for the single \nvariable that will explain crime.  See Gottfredson and Hirschi 1990. \n 23 \n                                                                                                                                            \n8 But the electronic data base of the new Social Science Library of the University of \nOxford does reach back to the 1920s. \n9 It is, of course, possible that citation practices in journal articles are sui generis, and \nthat books would disclose different patterns, but I can think of no good reason why \nthis should be so. \n10 Anonymous referee of an earlier draft of this article. \n11 See, for example, the journals that are devoted in metaphysical fashion to citation \nresearch itself, including criminological citation:  Journal Citation Reports and Jour-\nnal Performance Indicators.  Criminologists have themselves explored how often and \nwhere they and their colleagues have been cited (for instance,  Cohn and Farrington \n1998).   And The British Journal of Criminology\u2019s own web-site contains information \nabout how it is ranked in citation studies.       \n12 The tabulations were done by Michael Prachar to whom I am grateful. \n13 Edwin Sutherland was cited in the 1951 volume and in all other volumes except that \nof 1960, and Howard Becker began to make his mark in the 1960 volume and has \nbeen steadily cited thereafter.   \n14 Nicky Rafter, for example, found it difficult to come across a copy of the first edition of \nthe English translation of Lombroso\u2019s Donna Delinquante, published by T. Fisher Unwin \nin London in 1895 as The Female Offender.  See her introduction to the new version of the \nwork which she herself edited (Lombroso 2004).   \n15 I was struck not only by the feeling that permeated many of their answers \u2013 it is \nclear that colleagues sense that all is not right with the discipline\u2019s management of its \npast \u2013 but also by their candour.  People expressed themselves with admirable frank-\nness.  All quotations unaccompanied by documentary citation should be assumed to \nstem from interview or email correspondence. \n 24 \n                                                                                                                                            \n16 But he added, and in illustration of the ambivalence we all tend to share in selecting \nauthorities, that \u2018I also feel that you have to deal with arguments in terms of their \nstrongest possible presentation and therefore if I know there\u2019s a kind of new book or \narticle to be written on a particular line, then I\u2019d probably want to tackle that rather \nthan an earlier version of the same argument.\u2019    \n17 Lucia Zedner observed \u2018for all the reasons your respondents set out, it is not so sur-\nprising that there is a strong tendency to quote the latest author.  What intrigues me is \nwhy and how the \u2018classic\u2019 works, still cited decades hence, achieve this status.  Pre-\nsumably it is largely a result of their outstanding calibre, but I suspect it is not only \nthat.  Take the example example of Herbert Packer\u2019s The Limits of the Criminal Sanc-\ntion [1969], a work still widely cited thirty years on but judging from the references \nprobably scarcely ever read, it might be that some works gain a citation history that is \nalmost independent of the original work.\u2019 \n18 \u2018Teaching quality assurance\u2019 is part of the new battery of regulatory mechanisms \nimposed internally and externally on British universities under the new managerialism \nintroduced in the 1980s and 1990s. \n19  External examiners in the UK are recruited as a matter of course from other univer-\nsities to inspect assessed work, advise on procedures and otherwise ensure that the \nstandards applied in examinations in one university are comparable in quality with \nthose maintained elsewhere. \n20 Adam Crawford said \u2018Criminology as many people have noted is a \u2018rendez-vous\u2019 \ndiscipline, and not everyone comes to the discipline with the same background rooted \nin traditional social\/criminological texts. . . . [Some] have their backgrounds in phi-\nlosophy, law, policy studies, politics etc. We should not expect all those that engage \nwith criminology to be aficionados in the discipline.\u2019 \n 25 \n                                                                                                                                            \n21 Yet I am still not sure that the fragmentation of an eclectic and pragmatic discipline \nwholly explains why the past should be so decisively obliterated within each of its \nstrands. \n22 The Research Assessment Exercise is a periodic review of the quantity, quality and \nenvironment of research in all university departments that is conducted for the pur-\npose of apportioning State funds. \n23 Another colleague remarked that, when reviewing articles for journals, she might in \nappropriate cases \u2018ask . . .  why doesn\u2019t it have references beyond 1985?  . . .     I \nwould certainly in referee\u2019s comments say \u2018why hasn\u2019t this person referred to a \nbroader and more up-to-date literature?\u2019\u2019 \n24 Tim Newburn said:  \u2018I think in any of the fields we might work within, I suspect \nlots of people will have in their minds some sort of picture of who are the people who \n. . . for whatever reason, are closest to the centre of things, intellectually, scholarly, \nempirically or otherwise.  And there becomes a kind of informal league table I sus-\npect, one which we might not necessarily agree upon, but we probably all guess we \nmight share to some extent. And I suspect . . . network analysis would find . . . first \ndivision folk citing first division folk more than . . .  citing people they consider to be \nthird division folk.\u2019  Robert Reiner said more simply, \u2018citing people you know is not \njust a question of being friendly, it\u2019s just that they are the first names that come to \nmind as it were.\u2019  Curiously enough, only one of the criminologists interviewed said \nthat he circulated or received off-prints as a matter of course (\u2018I realize now that even \nif [an article is] in a good journal, there\u2019s absolutely no guarantee [that people would \nsee it].  And if you want someone to rate it, you probably need to send it to them.  \nAnd so I\u2019ve now started . . . \u2019)  It might have been supposed not only that off-prints \n 26 \n                                                                                                                                            \nwould also act as boundary-markers but would contribute to the propensity to cite the \ncurrent work of those regarded as fellow insiders. \n25 Declan Roche said \u2018I think you probably do look to find opportunities to cite your friends \nif you can.  I mean if it\u2019s a choice between two books and one was by a friend, you\u2019d cer-\ntainly put the one in by a friend or at least put it in as well.\u2019   \n26 David Downes observed \u2018I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything too wrong with that because \nthere\u2019s a great danger that, in the huge wealth of work that\u2019s done, that people get \noverlooked and neglected even though their work is invaluable.\u2019   Coretta Phillips re-\nmarked \u2018I suppose what I\u2019ve done sometimes is . . . cite Masters\u2019 dissertations or . . .  \nthings where somebody\u2019s done what I think is some really interesting work, and I . . . \nsee that as a way of promoting them . . . [where] perhaps they\u2019re not exposed or well \nknown about.\u2019  And Robert Reiner said very much the same. \n27 In a rather different sense, Nigel Fielding commented that \u2018Catching these citation \ncircles is a major objection of citation analysis. It involves some complex program-\nming and is an established sub-field of science policy studies. A contemporary appli-\ncation is coming under the aegis of e-Science (Grid and High Performance computing \nfor scientific applications), where citation analysis is used in fields like biology to \ndeal with the overload in numbers of scientific papers; cross-citation is used to estab-\nlish promising lines of research and the technique is of particular importance in hu-\nman medicine. The key point about citation analysis is not to focus on individuals but \non aggregates such as research groups connected with other research groups.\u2019 \n28 That practice seems to have been rife in criminological folk-lore.  Robert Reiner \ncould also remember how \u2018I was once at a National Deviancy Group symposium in \nthe early \u2018[19]70s and I was on the disco floor when one famous new criminologist \nkind of danced by, and there\u2019s another one, and they tapped each other on the shoul-\n 27 \n                                                                                                                                            \nder and said, \u201cright, it\u2019s agreed then, I\u2019ll cite you on page 7 if you cite me on page \n14.\u201d\u2019  It is not clear whether Frances Heidensohn was on that disco floor at the same \ntime or whether it was another conversation she heard. \n29 Nigel Fielding again remarked that \u2018The current equivalent of this includes practic-\nes that manipulate online search engines. There are several practices. One anony-\nmously \u2018reviews\u2019 one\u2019s own book for Amazon, asks everyone with whom one is \nfriendly to cite your review in an online message, and the compiler devices that look \nfor \u2018hits\u2019 to identify publications about which \u2018everyone is talking\u2019 will elevate your \nitem. . . . I am aware that there are several Masters programmes that have engaged in \nthese practices so that if one types in a search for \u2018criminology and criminal justice\u2019 \ngiven courses come up receiving more mentions. It strikes me as pretty shoddy.\u2019 \n30 I am grateful to Nigel Dodd for this point. \n31 M.
