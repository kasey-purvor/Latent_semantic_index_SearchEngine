Neither play had significant box-office\nsuccess,1 and The Break of Day received poor\nand hostile reviews from (male) critics, many\nof whom, like Paul Taylor for The Independ-\nent, commented on the play as a dramatization\nof 'how the maternal drive can cause women to\nbetray orthodox feminism'.2 My counter argu-\nment is that by addressing infertility as a\nfeminist issue for the 1990s, both plays index\nthe need to re-conceive a politics of mother-\nhood in an international arena, highlighting the\nways in which the biological contours of\nwomen's lives are globally mapped with the\nspecificities of social, material and cultural\ngeographies.\nThe Break of Day\nWertenbaker's The Break of Day was performed\nin tandem with Chekhov's Three Sisters by Max\nStafford-Clark's Out of Joint company. Werten-\nbaker's three 'sisters', at the close of this cen-\ntury, are three 'successful' women\u2014Tess, Nina\nand April\u2014whose lives were influenced by the\nWomen's Liberation Movement in the 1970s.3\nAct One has a Chekhovian feel: a house in the\ncountry where the women, accompanied by\nhusbands or lovers, gather together for Tess's\nfortieth birthday party, talk about their lives,\nand in particular examine their middle-class\nfeminist aspirations of the post-liberation\nyears. Tess, now a high-flying editor of a glossy\nwomen's magazine, Nina, a singer-song writer,\nand April, a university lecturer, are dissatisfied\nwith professional and personal 'achievements'.\nNone has children: April is childless by choice;\nTess and Nina both desire but cannot have\nchildren. The play explores the different ways\nin which Nina and Tess struggle to bring chil-\ndren into their lives.\nThe emotional intensity with which Tess and\nNina talk about their infertility and the desire to\nhave children, coupled with their discussion of\nfeminism\u2014in particular the loss of empower-\nment which the feminist climate of the 1970s\ngave them\u2014may suggest, on the surface, a back-\nlash play. But in staging this moment of non-\nreproductive realization for a particular genera-\ntion of white, middle-class, economically privi-\nleged, Western women, Wertenbaker does not\nembark on a 'betrayal of orthodox feminism',\nbut rather opens up a complex, materialist-\nfeminist debate on mothering, the family and\nnationalism.\nWertenbaker explains her concern in The\nBreak of Day to write about 'the fatigue at the\nend of the century, the breakdown of a lot of\nideals, particularly for women'.4 In her play,\nEngland in the 1990s is characterized as a\ncountry in which feminism is eroded and\nsocial systems\u2014health, education and wel-\nfare\u2014are in a state of collapse. The possibility\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 27 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\n248 Theatre Research International\nof a more 'democratic opening',5 of moving\nbeyond the millennium moment of 'fatigue'\nand 'breakdown', requires thinking beyond an\nEnglish, nationalist, isolationist, 'island mental-\nity'.6 A Brechtian-inflected montage of short\nquick-changing scenes is used to relocate from\nthe opening, country house realist setting in\nEngland, to the chaos of a post-Communist\nsociety opening up to capitalism somewhere\n(precisely where is never specified) in Eastern\nEurope, as Nina and her record-producing hus-\nband, Hugh, struggle to adopt an abandoned\nbaby. The geographical and locational shifts\nbetween Acts One and Two are central to\nWertenbaker's vision, or rather glimpse, of a\nnew, more democratically organized society,\nconceived of globally, rather than nationally,\nand offering a more hopeful political solution\nto women's personal, maternal lives.\nHope for the future is represented in the figure\nof the cross-border child, explained in what is\narguably the play's most important and most\nmemorable speech, delivered as a monologue by\nthe East European Mihail, who refuses to\n'recant' his Communism:\nNow it [history] will be in the hands of the chil-\ndren, possibly most of all, these cross-border chil-\ndren I have helped to get out. Born in one country,\nloved and raised in another, I hope they will not\ndescend into narrow ethnic identification, but that\nthey will be wilfully international, part of a great\nEuropean community . . . We must not go into the\nnext century with no ideal but selfishness.7\nThe cross-border child represents a concept of the\nfamily based not on nation, but on 'community',\none which crosses borders and involves the col-\nlaboration between two sets of beliefs: Western\nfeminism and Eastern Communism, both strug-\ngling to find a way to exist in allegedly 'demo-\ncratic', 'post-feminist' and 'post-Communist'\ncommunities; struggling to find a selfless way\nforward in a world which, as Mihail describes, has\n'no ideal but selfishness', and where 'people talk\nfreely, but only about money' (pp. 82-3). In work-\ning together to secure a future for the child, Hugh\nand Nina from the West, Mihail and his wife, Eva,\nfrom the East, find ways to circumvent, manip-\nulate and resist the local, social and legal systems\nwhich stand in their way, in whatever ways they\ncan, including, for example, the Western, bour-\ngeois appeal to the heart.8 The collaboration and\nresistance of this small group of people point to\nthe need for a large-scale, cross-border collabora-\ntion to achieve social and cultural transforma-\ntion.9\nThe gender of the cross-border child (a girl) is\nhighly significant. In the moment of A Break of\nDay's production, the issue of overseas adop-\ntion\u2014or transracial adoption, as Wertenbaker's\nsocial worker in Act Three terms it,10\u2014was\nheadline news, as couples in the UK and US\nadopted baby girls from China.11 The issue of\nunwanted female children in China received\nwidespread publicity in the UK following the\ntelevision documentary The Dying Rooms (June\n1995) which alleged that in a country which\nrestricts families to one child, making boys the\npriority, the girls are abandoned and left to die in\norphanages. The plight of the children tugged\nat the heart strings in a way which, although\nunderstandable, threatened to overshadow the\nspecificity of the social, political and economic\nconditions which had given rise to this terrible\nsituation. Similarly, there is a danger in Werten-\nbaker's play, as the spectator is hooked into and\ncarried away by the suspense of whether or not\nNina will succeed in her mission to save the\nchild, of sentimentalizing what in other ways\nshe seeks to establish as a materialist-feminist\ncritique of capitalism 'birthing' an unequal and\nexploitative future.\nThat it is Mihail, the unreformed Commu-\nnist, who is largely responsible for Nina and\nHugh finally acquiring their baby girl is signific-\nant. Mihail's anti-capitalist attitude signals that\nhis motive for helping the childless British\ncouple is selfless rather than selfish; that he is\nnot one of the businessmen profiting from the\ntrading in babies.13 Wertenbaker underlines this\npoint by intercutting the East-West post-femin-\nist, post-Communist struggle for a 'future', with\nTess who tries a different route for a baby. She\nseeks infertility treatment from the ironically\nnamed Dr Glad. Her struggle to conceive high-\nlights the financial, physical and emotional cost\nto women who pursue fertility treatment\nthrough reproductive technology, owned and\noperated by men. Tess loses control over her\nown body, is disempowered by the intervention\nof technology, and after all her physical and\nemotional pain, has no baby to show for it.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 27 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nGeographies of Oppression 249\nNina's adoption quest reveals that there are\nother options. This is not to suggest clear-cut\n'right' and 'wrong' solutions. While, on the one\nhand, Wertenbaker implies a criticism of Tess's\nwhite, middle-class, materially advantaged,\nbourgeois feminist position, on the other hand,\nshe is resistant to the idea that the audience sit\nin judgement. Tess, in a self-defensive moment\nin Act Three, cries: 'Don't judge me! [More\nquietly.) I see myself.' (p. 91)14\nWhat is clear, however, is that it is necessary\nto move out of the isolated, English country\nhouse and a colonial past which continues to\n'birth' an unequal future; which may choose\nwhether to give shelter to, but cannot provide\na 'home' for, the displaced 'other'.15 The biolo-\ngical mother who haunts the figure of the cross-\nborder child, an absent\/present, colonized\n'other', might come differently into view in a\ncross-border community where families re-form\nacross geographies landscaped through greater\ngender and racial equality.\nA Yearning\nLike The Break of Day, Ruth Carter's A Yearn-\ning, performed by the Asian theatre company\nTamasha, revisits and revisions a 'canonical'\ntext as it engages with the debate on mother-\nhood and the issue of infertility. A Yearning\ntransposes Lorca's Andalusian landscape and\nspeech of Yerma to a multicultural, Punjabi\ncommunity in Birmingham. Amar (Yerma) is\nnow married to Jas (Juan), a Glaswegian Asian\nwho struggles not on the land but with a taxi\nfirm. As in Yerma, A Yearning focuses on\nAmar's desire for a child, which unfolds as a\nnarrative of increasing desperation and despair,\nand finally drives her to kill her husband.\nMy initial response to the performance of A\nYearning was a highly charged emotional reac-\ntion to Amar's desperation for a child, coloured\nby my own white feminism and fertility. The\nanguish of infertility played out in the perform-\nance was what touched me first and foremost. For\ninstance, I was deeply affected by the moment\nwhen Amar, surrounded by child-bearing women\nfrom her community, cries out:\nYou women with children you can't imagine what\nit's like for us without. You 'wish I wouldn't talk\nlike this'. It shows you're ignorant of the pain\ninside me, like a fish swimming in water that has\nno idea what thirst is. Because what you don't\nunderstand is that it doesn't get better. I want it\nmore and more and the longer it goes on the less\nhope there is.16\nSubsequently, however, I found I needed to\ncontest this response and to re-frame my initial\nreactions to Amar's childless body through the\nconcerns of black British feminism.17 Looked\nat in this way, then, it is a black feminist\ncritique of the social, cultural and religious\norganization of an Asian community and its\nfamilial structures which come more firmly\ninto focus through the infertility motif. This\nmay be examined through the triangular posi-\ntioning of Amar, Jas and the community of\nAsian women.\nAmar is representative of another kind of\ncross-border figure: a young woman who\ncrosses from her Punjabi birthplace in India\nto live in a Punjabi community in Britain,\nwhich, as Kristine Landon-Smith, Tamasha's\ndirector, explains, can be more conservative\nthan in India: 'The Punjabi community in\nBritain does not seem to have lost connection\nwith its rural roots. It is almost as though the\ncommunity, in an effort to retain its culture\nagainst a foreign landscape, is even more tradi-\ntional than the Punjabi community in Indian\nsociety today.'18 The crossing between commu-\nnities, or worlds, is encoded in Amar's speech\nand songs. When Amar sings at her sewing\nmachine (a recurrent motif to signal her\ndomestic entrapment) her songs switch\nbetween Punjabi and English. To the Western\near, her speech patterns sound lyrical or poetic,\nbut Kristine Landon-Smith explains that in\nPunjabi (as in Lorca's Andalusian peasant com-\nmunity) 'metaphorical speech is natural and\ntherefore when written down it is meant to\nbe an authentic representation of that speech\nand not poetic text'.19\nAs Amar is forced into the traditional ways\ndictated by her cultural, religious and social\nbackground, she effectively becomes a prisoner\nin her own home. She tries to escape from the\nhouse into the city streets, but each time she\n'escapes', she is brought home by her husband\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 27 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\n250 Theatre Research International\n(and his sisters who are sent to keep an eye on\nher) and chastised for her 'improper' behaviour,\nand for 'spoiling' his reputation. As Pragna Patel\nexplains in her discussion of Asian women and\nthird wave feminism, 'women's minds and\nbodies are the battleground for the preservation\nof religious and communal identities. So the role\nof women as signifiers and transmitters of iden-\ntity within the family become crucial.'20\nA Yearning shows, and is critical of, the\nextent to which the identity of the young\nAsian wife is bound up in a maternal identity.\nAmar's lack of self-worth is rooted in her 'fail-\nure' to conceive, to become a mother: 'A Punjabi\ngirl who doesn't produce sons\u2014she is as useless\nas a handful of husks. Empty and useless.' (p. 41)\nThe pressure on young Asian women to con-\nceive early in marriage was researched for the\nplay through women's organizations. One Asian\nreviewer explained that:\nAccording to Neeru Desai, chairman of the Harrow\nWomen's Association, a community group in\nNorth London, there is pressure on the young\nwife to produce the first child fairly quickly. 'If\nafter a year or two of marriage, there isn't a child,\npeople start asking questions. It's usually the\nwomen's fault, even if in medical terms it isn't.'21\nRather than face the fact that it is his fault that\nthey cannot have children, Jas irrationally\naccuses Amar of promiscuity, madness and\nevil. Amar protests that she is 'blameless', but\nJas does not listen. He is obsessed with the way\nin which her 'infertility' alters his standing in\nthe community: 'I enter the office everybody\ngoes quiet. I order a drink I get a funny look.\nMy regular customers, they're not friendly like\nthey used to be with me. They're not easy.\nThere's a look in their eye. Why? You tell me\nwhy?' (p. 51)\nAmar is oppressed not just by her Indian past\nin the Punjab, but also by the multicultural\nvalues of the Punjabi community in Britain. In\nBritain, multiculturalism appears to suggest the\nredefinition of culture along the lines of ethnic\ndiversity and difference, but in reality, diversity\nand difference exist only in relation to, or\ndefined by the hegemony of white, dominant\nculture.22 Moreover, as Patel argues, this inequi-\ntable arrangement between dominant and min-\nority cultures creates the opportunity for\nThe logo of Tamasha Theatre Company\n'community leaders' to act as 'power-brokers\nand middle-men' between state and minority\ncommunities. Such male 'leaders', however,\nwill not be seeking to promote the rights of\nwomen.23 Jas, who internalizes the white con-\nservative values of his multicultural Punjabi\ncommunity, is driven by the need to be finan-\ncially successful in his taxi business. He can\ncope with the absence of a child providing that\nAmar keeps out of sight in the home. Secluded\nin her domestic prison, she is the slave, the\ncolonized 'other', who endorses his position as\ncolonizer\/master. Her refusal, however, threa-\ntens to undo the binarism of the master\/slave\narrangement, to expose the impotence of his\npatriarchal 'mastery' through which the image\nof the British-Asian family is constructed and\nupheld. In brief, A Yearning deconstructs what\nPatel describes as 'the construction of the homo-\ngenous Asian family' which 'hides other real-\nities, power relations and power struggles\nbetween different caste, class and ethnic\ngroups, and especially between men and\nwomen' (my emphasis, p. 261). Ultimately, as\nher Punjabi honour will not allow her to con-\nsider taking a lover, Amar takes the life of the\noppressor who would not let her live: give her\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 27 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nGeographies of Oppression 251\nArchie Panjabi and Sudha Bhuchar (left to right) in A Yearning, 1995 (PHOTO: Sue Mayes)\nlife. This violent rebellion of the colonized\n'other' is presented as the only alternative to a\nlife of domestic subjugation.24\nOther women from the community who figure\nin A Yearning function as a kind of chorus\u2014\ngossiping, criticizing, blaming. There are occa-\nsional notes of discontent as the Asian wives and\nmothers express a desire for an existence other\nthan that of their stay-at-home routines of cook-\ning samosas and watching Punjabi videos, but\nthey have no choice. The strongest objection to\nthe social construction of the Asian wife\/mother\nfrom within the female community comes from\nthe voice of the old woman, played in the pro-\nduction by the Indian actress Zohra Segal, now in\nher eighties. Against the expectation that the\nmost senior representative of the female com-\nmunity will reflect the most traditional values,\nSegal's role sounded the most critical, feminist\nnote. In her first encounter with Amar, the\nelderly Asian is critical of the system of arranged\nmarriages which does not allow women to choose\nfor themselves; and in their last meeting she\nproposes that Amar find another man to give\nher the child she desires, arguing that 'these are\nmodern times' (p. 57). That both the role of the old\nwoman and that of Amar were played by actresses\nfamiliar to theatregoers through their film and\ntelevision work in the field of popular culture, is\nan important factor in trying to persuade audi-\nences that these are 'modern times' and that the\norganization of the Asian family which ties\nwomen to a biological, maternal 'destiny' is in\nneed of radical, social transformation.26\nIn her conclusion, Patel argues for the need to\nmove beyond identity politics, in search of 'new\nways of resisting and new ways of truly demo-\ncratic thinking', most importantly arguing that\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 27 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\n252 Theatre Research International\n'our alliances must cross our different identities,\nand help us to reconceptualize notions of demo-\ncracy, human rights and citizenship'.27 Werten-\nbaker's plea for a collaborative, cross-border,\ndemocratic re-modelling of national, social and\nfamilial structures, is not dissimilar. The dia-\nspora of Amar's dispossessed and displaced body\nin the 'home' of British-Asian multiculturalism\nsuggests the urgency with which feminists\nacross borders need to find new meeting grounds\nto pursue and to develop these 'new ways of\nresisting and new ways of truly democratic\nthinking'.\nNotes\nI should like to thank Alison Altaian (free-lance theatre\npractitioner and tutor), Tamasha Theatre Company and the\nHaymarket Theatre, Leicester for their help with research for\nthis article.\n1.

For instance, in order to win over Dr Romanova at the\nMinistry of Health, Eva, a self-confessed 'ideologist of the\nheart', 'performs' in the style of a Western domestic melo-\ndrama, calling on her to have 'pity for the mother and child\nin this world full of pain' (p. 81).\n9. There is a parallel to be drawn, I think, between the\nsmall group of people involved in the cross-border adoption\nand the small-scale touring company which Robert, Tess's\nhusband, joins to play Vershinin in Chekhov's Three Sisters.\n(Act Three is set backstage in a northern provincial theatre\non Robert's last night of the production, p. 89.) Both situ-\nations involve small groups of people committed to social\nand cultural 'causes', based on selfless rather than selfish\nprinciples. In respect of the Chekhov production, for ex-\nample, it is made clear that this is a non-profit-making\nenterprise that very few people will go to see.\n10. Overseas adoption is generally referred to in the UK as\neither transracial or intercultural. Explained to me by Alison\nAltman, telephone interview, 9 February 1998.\n11. Earlier, in 1994, overseas adoption received media\nattention through the case of a British couple, Adrian and\nBernadette Mooney, who were given a jail sentence (later\nsuspended) for trying to smuggle a child out of Romania.\n12. It was this programme which prompted Alison\nAltman to embark on the overseas adoption of her daughter,\nRosa, a cross-border child who arrived in the UK in 1997. As\na feminist, Altman was particularly distressed by the way in\nwhich it was the baby girls who, in China, are left to die.\nAltman, telephone interview, 9 February 1998.\n13. While it would be wrong to assume that this is a\nphenomenon of all overseas adoption, contributors to Nan-\nette Funk & Magda Mueller, eds., Gender Politics and Post-\nCommunism (London: Routledge, 1993) note that this is a\nproblem specific to certain post-Communist countries. For\nexample, writing on women in Romania in the volume,\nMariana Hausleitner notes how the lifting of restrictions\non the adoption of Romanian babies gave rise to a 'booming\nbusiness' (p. 57), and Alena Heitlinger detailing post-Com-\nmunist changes for Czech and Slovak women cites instances\nof international 'commercial exploitation of women's sexual\nand childbearing capacity' in cases of international surrogacy\nand adoption (p. 104).\n14. It is difficult to dramatize the trauma of infertility\ntreatment without either falling into the trap of presenting\nthe bourgeois, individualist, personal struggle of one would-\nbe mother, or, appearing to argue a backlash return to\nmotherhood as women's biological, essentialist destiny. It\nis important to note, therefore, the way in which Tess's\nstruggle is staged through a Brechtian dramaturgy and\nwithin the motif of the cross-border adoption.\n15. In Act One, for example, Wertenbaker introduces the\nfigure of Natasha who is possibly a Bosnian refugee and is\nemployed by Tess as a domestic. It becomes clear, however,\nthat nobody really knows where she is from or who she is,\nand not until the end of the act is it considered important to\nfind out.\n16.

I am grateful to Alicia Arrizon for the proposal she\nmade in our IFTR\/FIRT feminist working group that I\n'contest' in order to open up other ways of feminist 'seeing'.\n18. Quoted in the programme notes to A Yearning.\n19. Ibid. This point is reinforced in moments when Amar\ncannot follow figurative speech. She is confused for example\nby the old woman who gossips with her asking 'when you\nstep out doesn't the mangiest dog in the street start sniffing',\nand Amar, totally puzzled, asks 'Dog? What Dog?'
