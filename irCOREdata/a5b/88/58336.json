Introduction \n \nPolybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), the synthetic compounds used as flame \nretardants in plastics, polyurethane foams and high impact polystyrene, are found in a \nmultitude of  products including televisions, computers, textiles and furniture \nupholstery (Rahman et al. 2001). PBDEs effectively reduce fire hazards in polymeric \nmaterials by releasing bromine atoms which capture OH and H radicals formed during \ncombustion at a temperature approximately 50 \u00baC below ignition temperature of the \npolymer matrix (Rahman et al. 2001). However, additive flame retardants including \nPBDEs are not chemically bound to the host polymer and are thus susceptible to \nleaching into the environment. The presence of PBDEs in sediments is of concern \nsince they can potentially bioaccumulate, transfer up the food web and once ingested \nby humans may cause thyroid hormone disruption, alter neurodevelopment and \ninterfere with reproductive systems (Talsness 2008). \n \n The three commercial formulations are penta-BDE (DE-71, Bromokal 70-\n50E), octa-BDE (DE-79 and Bromokal 79) and deca-BDE (Saytex 102E, Bromokal \n82-E) (Talsness 2008). The penta- technical formulation is most commonly used in \npolyurethane foams for furniture and is comprised of 24-38 % tetra- and 40-60 % \npenta-congeners (BDE-47 and 99) and 4-8% hexa-. The octa-mixture is mainly used \nin polyamide and polystyrene and is composed of 10-12% hexa-, 44 % hepta-, 31-35 \n% octa-, 10-11 % nona- and 1 % deca-BDEs with the main congeners BDE-153 and \nBDE-183 (Alaee et al. 2003). In contrast the deca-mixture (Bromokal 82-E, Great \nLakes Chemical Corp. DE-83) is used in commercial textiles and plastics including \ncomputer housings and is comprised of ~97% BDE-209 with 3% nona- and octa-\nBDEs. Severe restrictions on the use (<0.1% of mass for all goods) and marketing of \n 3\nocta-BDE and penta-BDE mixtures in Europe became effective under European law \nin 2004 and 2006 due to the high bioaccumulation potential (Law et al. 2006). \nFurthermore the European court of Justice annulled the exemption of deca-BDE in \nelectrical and electronic goods placed on the European union market after June 30th \n2008.  \n \nBrominated compounds can enter the coastal environment directly from \npolymer production, through leaching during usage, from waste streams such as \nincinerators, landfill sites and \/ or automotive scrap yards as well as from sewage \nsludge dumping. The accumulation of PBDEs in sediments is not entirely unexpected \ngiven their range of physiochemical properties such as low water solubility, low \nvapour pressures and elevated  log KOW values of 5-10 as well as relatively high \nresistance to biodegradation (Alcock et al. 1993). From a bioacumulative and \ntoxicological standpoint the lower molecular tetra-, penta- and hexa-homologues are \nmore important than the octa- nona-and deca-brominated counterparts (Hale et al. \n2001).  \n \nThe aim of this study was to determine the individual concentration of 16 \nPBDEs and identify changing congener and homologue group distributions in six \nshort sediment cores from the Clyde Estuary, UK. The focus being to ascertain \nwhether sedimentary hosted PBDE concentrations are on the decline or are increasing. \n \nMaterials and Methods \n \nSample collection  \nSediment gravity cores were collected between November 2002 and February 2003 \n(Fig. 1). Sampling sites in the estuary were accessed using the SEPA vessel \u2018Endrick \nII\u2019, using pre-determined GPS co-ordinates to locate accurately each position. (Table \n1). Each sediment core was refrigerated on the day of collection in order to minimise \nmicrobial decay (Rost et al. 2002). Upon return to the laboratory each core was cut in \nhalf and sampled at ~10 cm intervals using a stainless steel spatula.  \n \nSample preparation \n 4\nSediments were freeze-dried, sieved to pass a brass mesh of aperture 2 mm, the <2 \nmm ground in an agate Tema mill to <200 \u00b5m then ground further in an agate ball \nmill to <40 \u00b5m. Sediments (5-15 g) were spiked with CDE-99, PCB209 and 13C-PCB \n141 and extracted with a mixture of acetone and hexane (1:1) for 48 h with a Soxhlet \nextractor. Activated copper granules were added to the soxhlet flasks during \nextraction to remove elemental sulfur. Concentrated extracts were cleaned and \nfractionated on a 10-mm i.d. silica\/alumina column packed, from the bottom to top, \nwith neutral alumina (6 cm, 3% deactivated), neutral silica gel (2 cm, 3% \ndeactivated), 25% sodium hydroxide silica (5 cm), neutral silica gel (2 cm, 3% \ndeactivated), 50% sulfuric acid silica (8 cm), and anhydrous sodium sulfate (1 cm). \nThe PBDE mixture was eluted with 30 mL of hexane and 60 mL of hexane:methylene \nchloride (1:1), and the final extract volume was reduced to 500 \u03bcL under a gentle N2 \nstream. A known amount of internal standard (13C-PCB 208, BDE-118 and BDE128) \nwas added to all extracts prior to instrumental analysis. \n \nGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry \n \nSample analysis was performed with a Shimadzu Model 2010 gas chromatograph \n(GC) coupled with a Model QP2010 mass spectrometer (MS) (Shimadzu, Japan) \nusing negative chemical ionization (NCI) in the selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. \nA DB-XLB (30 m \u00d7 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 \u03bcm film thickness) capillary column (J&W) \nwas used for the determination of PBDE congeners except for BDE-209. The column \ntemperature was initiated at 110 \u00b0C (held for 1 min) and increased to 180 \u00b0C at 8 \n\u00b0C\/min (held for 1 min), 240 \u00b0C at 2 \u00b0C\/min (held for 5 min), 280 \u00b0C at 2 \u00b0C\/min \n(held for 25 min), and 290 \u00b0Cat 5 \u00b0C\/min (held for 13 min). Manual injection of the 1-\n\u03bcL samples was conducted in the splitless mode and the split mode was turned on \nafter 1 min. Methane was used as a chemical ionization moderating gas at an ion \nsource pressure of 2.4 \u00d710-3 Pa and helium as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 \nmL\/min. The ion source and interface temperatures were set to 200 and 280\uf0b0C, \nrespectively. For BDE-209, a CP-Sil 13 CB (12.5m \u00d7 0.25 mm i.d., 0.2 \u03bcm film \nthickness) capillary column (Chrom pack) was used. The oven temperature was \nprogrammed from 110 to 300 \u00b0C at a rate of 8 \u00b0C\/min (held for 20 min) and the high-\npressure splitless injection mode was used with a split time of 1 min. \n 5\n \nIon fragments m\/z 79 and 81 ([Br]-) were monitored for tri- to hepta-BDEs, and \nm\/z 79, 81, 486.7, and 488.7 for BDE-209. For surrogate standards, m\/z 342 and 344 \nwere monitored for CDE-99, m\/z 372 and 374 for 13C-PCB 141 and m\/z 498, and 500 \nfor PCB 209. In addition, m\/z 476, and 478 were used for the internal standard (13C-\nPCB 208) and m\/z 79, 81 for BDE-118 and -128. Quantification of tri- to hepta-BDEs \nwas carried out with the internal calibration procedure, whereas BDE-209 was \nquantified with the external standard method. Peaks were quantified only if the \nsignal\/noise > 3 and the ratio between two monitored ions was within 15% of the \nstandard value. BDE-85 was not quantified due to chromatographic interference in \nsome of the samples. The limit of detection (LOD), defined as a signal of 3 times the \nnoise level, ranged from 0.01 to 0.04 ng\/g for all congeners except for BDE-209, \nwhen 10 g of dry sediment was extracted. The LOD for BDE-209 was 1 ng\/g. \n \nFor each batch of 20 field samples, a procedural blank (solvent with a filter paper \nidentical to that used to wrap the sediment), a spiked blank (11 PBDE congeners \nspiked into solvent with the filter paper), and a sample duplicate were processed. Only \nsmall concentrations of BDE-47 and -99 were found in procedural blanks, and they \nwere appropriately subtracted from those in the sample extracts. Recoveries of 11 \nPBDEs congeners (BDE-28, -47, -66, -100, -99, -85, -154, -153, -138, -183, and -209) \nranged from 86.4 \u00b113.2% in five spiked blank samples. Reported concentrations were \nnot surrogate recovery corrected.  \u03a3PBDEs values were determined from the sum of \nthe peak areas of BDE-28, -47, -66, -100, -99, -85, -154, -153, -138, -183, -197,-203,-\n196,-208, -207 and 209; homologue group concentrations were determined from  the \nappropriate congener(s). \n \nResults and Discussion \n \nConcentrations and distribution \n \nThe \u03a3PBDEs and \u03a3PBDEs (except BDE-209) from six sediment cores are \npresented in Fig. 2 and the concentration of nona- to penta-BDE shown in Fig. 3. \nTotal PBDE concentrations ranged from 1 to 2645 \u03bcg\/kg dry weight and the \u03a3PBDEs \nexcept BDE-209 ranged from 1 to 307 \u03bcg\/kg (Fig. 2).  The concentration of BDE-209 \n 6\nvaried from 1 to 2337 \u03bcg\/kg and comprised on average 80 % of all BDEs measured. \nThe concentration of BDE-209 was higher than that of the summed concentrations of \ntri-, tetra-, penta-, hexa- and hepta-homologue groups in all the sediments as \nexemplified by the typical PBDE homologue group concentrations presented in Fig. 4. \nRecent studies of four sediment cores from the Garroch Head sewage disposal site in \nthe Firth of Clyde (located approximately 32 Km downstream of site 6) reported \nhigher values of <LOD to 23.4 \u03bcg\/kg (\u03a317PBDEs except BDE-209) and 2.3 to 98125 \n\u03bcg\/kg (BDE-209) (Webster et al. 2008). However, substantially lower values of \n<LOD (\u03a317PBDEs except BDE-209) and 3.5 to 5.5 \u03bcg\/kg (BDE-209) for a sediment \ngrab (Pladda)  located  on the southern tip of the Isle of Arran were also documented \n(Webster et al. 2008). Similarly highly polluted river and coastal sites in the UK such \nas the river Tees <0.3-368 (BDE-47) and <0.6-898 (BDE-99) have higher \nconcentrations of individual PBDE congeners than those observed in this current \nstudy of the inner Clyde (Allchin et al. 1999; Law et al. 2006). In this current study \nthe \u03a3PBDEs (except BDE-209) concentrations 1 to 307 \u03bcg\/kg from sediment cores \nare greater than those reported for the Garroch Head sewage dump sites but contain \nfar lower concentrations of BDE-209. One plausible explanation for this difference is \nthat the six sites reported in this work have not been impacted by direct dumping of \nsewage sludge (Law et al. 2006; Wang et al. 2007). Also, it is probable that PBDE \nconcentrations encountered in these inner estuarine sediment cores are derived in the \nmain from landfill sites, heavy and light industry and discharge from municipal \nsewage works with a minor aeolian sourced background.   \n \n On a world wide basis the PBDE concentrations reported in this study are \nbroadly comparable to those of surface sediments of the Pearl River Delta \n(\u03a317PBDEs except BDE-209) 0.04 to 94.7 \u03bcg\/kg and BDE-209 of 0.4 to 7340 \u03bcg\/kg \nbut are considerably higher than the Scheldt estuary and North Sea coastal sediments \n(\u03a3PBDEs except BDE-209) 0.4-0.6 and BDE-209 1-32 \u03bcg\/kg (Klamer et al. 2005; \nMai et al. 2005). No systematic change in PBDE concentrations were observed from \nPrinces Dock (1) to Greenock (6) suggesting that the PBDE pollution was derived \nfrom multiple sources as compared to a single point source (Fig. 2). \n \nDown profile variation in PBDE concentrations \n \n 7\nThe highest concentration of \u03a3PBDE 307 \u03bcg\/kg and BDE-209 2337 \u03bcg\/kg was \nobserved at the confluence of the river Cart and the Clyde, opposite Clydebank \nshipyard at Station 4 at a depth 5-10 cm and the lowest PBDE concentrations were \nobserved at station 2 near Partick. A recent study of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons \n(PAH) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in surface sediments from the Clyde \nestuary also showed higher levels of contamination associated with sediments close to \ndockyards as compared to the main channel (Vane et al. 2007a). Inspection of the \ndown core BDE-209 profiles revealed low concentrations at the base of all six \nsediment cores, however for stations 1, 3, 4 and 6 these concentrations gradually \nincreased to a maximum of 726, 419, 2337 and 795 \u03bcg\/kg at or close to the surface (0-\n10cm)  (Fig. 2).  For example, BDE-209 values at Station 1 ranged from 5 \u03bcg\/kg at 67 \ncm to 59 \u03bcg\/kg at 28 cm then increased fairly smoothly to 137 \u03bcg\/kg at 18 cm after \nwhich a rapid rise to 718 \u03bcg\/kg at 8 cm was observed before reaching maximum \nvalues 727 \u03bcg\/kg and levelling off at the surface (Fig. 2). In general, stations 3, 4 and \n6 showed similar changes in BDE-209 concentrations whereas the BDE-209 \nconcentrations at station 2 varied in a non-systematic manner yielding a narrow range \nof lower values from 2 \u03bcg\/kg at 22 cm to 116 \u03bcg\/kg at 32 cm (Fig. 2). In contrast, a \nthird type of BDE-209 profile at station 5 showed maximal BDE-209 values of 998 \n\u03bcg\/kg as well as slightly elevated \u03a3PBDE concentrations at ~35 cm (Fig. 2). \n \nNo uniform change of PBDE concentrations with depth was observed at station \n2. This could be due to vertical sedimentary mixing such as that reported in short \nsediment cores from North of Ellesmere port on the Mersey estuary, UK, (Vane et al. \n2007b). Although other processes such as diffusion cannot be entirely discounted they \nare unlikely given the low aqueous solubility and hydrophobic nature of PBDEs as \ndefined by their log Kow values. Similarly, for Station 5 the subsurface BDE-209 \nmaximum centred at 35 cm could be attributable to overturn of sediments during \ndredging of the main channel, sediment movement during storm events and \/ or \npossibly by a single discharge event (Figs. 2 and 3).  With the exception of station 5 \ncomparison of the \u03a3PBDE (excluding BDE-209) to BDE-209 profiles revealed a \nsubtle mirroring of the concentration patterns up core confirming the notion that \nPBDE concentrations were highest at or just below the sediment surface and \nindicating that the PBDEs were derived from similar sources (Fig. 2 & Fig 3). \n  \n 8\nPBDE congener and homologue group patterns \n \nOverall, four of the six BDE-209 concentration depth profiles suggested that \nPBDEs and particularly the deca-BDE mixture which is mainly comprised of ~97% \nBDE-209 are accumulating in the uppermost 0-10 cm of the inner Clyde estuary. An \nincreasing trend in environmental concentrations of PBDE and BDE-209 from 1970 \nto the mid-1990s has been reported in sediment cores from the Wadden Sea \n(Netherlands), Drammenfjord (Norway), Lake Woserin (Germany) and Pearl River \nDelta (China) and was attributed to increasing PBDE production and in the latter case, \nthe recent growth of the electronics industry in Southern China (Mai et al. 2005; \nZegers et al. 2003). In the present study the predominance and accumulation of BDE-\n209 close to the surface in Clyde sediments are commensurate with the greater \nhistorical production of Deca-mix PBDE formulation and the European ban of Octa- \nand Penta-mix formulations in 2004 (Law et al. 2006).  Although the deca-BDE are \nnow banned in electrical goods sold in Europe it is unlikely that sedimentary \nconcentrations will rapidly decline given the environmental persistence of PBDEs and \nwidespread usage in industrial and consumer products. This idea is supported in part \nby the fact that structurally similar PCB compounds are still found in estuarine \nsediments despite manufacture being prohibited in UK 1977 and total cessation of \nusage in closed low volume equipment in 2000.  \n \n The predominance of BDE-209 over other congeners in Clyde sediments is \nentirely consistent with recent environmental health studies of UK domestic indoor \ndusts which contained BDE-209 at concentrations as high as 45,000 \u03bcg\/kg (Harrad et \nal. 2008). Although the deca-BDE was clearly dominant, the presence of BDE-47 and \nBDE-99 at all depths also suggested input from sources containing the commercial \npenta-product and similarly the presence of BDE-183 and BDE-153 in the majority of \nthe sediments confirmed a contribution from the commercial octa-BDE product.   \n \n Nona-brominated congeners (BDE-206,-207,-208) were the second most \nabundant homologue group after deca-BDE and comprised on average 11% by weight \nof the total BDE inventory (Fig. 5). Previous characterisation by GC\/MS of technical \ndeca mixtures have shown that these are comprised of 0.3 to 8 % by weight depending \non the specific formulation, therefore the relative amount of nona-BDE observed here \n 9\nwas greater than would be expected from the original technical formulations (Alaee et \nal. 2003; Hoh & Hites 2005). One explanation could be that BDE-209 had undergone \ndebromination to yield a relative increase in nona-BDE. Laboratory photodegradation \nstudies have demonstrated stepwise debromination of deca-BDE to nona-, octa-, \nhepta- and hexa- homologues (Soderstrom et al. 2004). Alternatively, the higher \nproportion of nona-BDE than expected from deca formulations alone could be due to \nan octa-BDE source such as DE-79 (Great Lakes Chemical Corp.) which was \ncomprised of 25 % by weight nona-BDE, however other octa-BDE formulations have \nmuch lower proportions of nona-BDE (Alaee et al. 2003).  \n \nComparison of the downcore BDE-99 and BDE-47 concentration revealed that \nthe proportion of BDE-99 to BDE-47 was greater than or equal to unity for 49 of the \n71 sediment intervals (Fig. 5). The majority of the 22 sediments with higher \nconcentrations of BDE-47 as compared to BDE-99 were observed toward the base of \nthe sediment cores at stations 1, 2, and 6. In contrast cores at stations 3, 4 and 5 \ncontained more BDE-99 to BDE-49 at most depths. Commercial penta-BDE mixtures \nsuch as BromoKal 70-5DE and Great Lakes Chemicals DE-71 are comprised of  \napproximately equal amounts of BDE-99 and BDE-47 to give a BDE-99:BDE-47 \nratios of  ~1 and 0.7 respectively (Hale et al. 2001; Hassanin et al. 2004; Hoh & Hites \n2005; Mai et al. 2005).  However, a number of PBDE studies have reported the \npreferential decrease in BDE-47 compared to that of other congeners in soils and \nsediments which have received the penta-BDE mix including BDE-99 (Allchin et al. \n1999; Hassanin et al. 2004; Mai et al. 2005). This change was postulated to be due \neither to the slightly higher octanol\/water partition coefficient of BDE-99 as compared \nto BDE-47 or to greater degradation of BDE-47 and \/ or aeolian transport effects \n(Hale et al. 2001; Hassanin et al. 2004). In the current study the higher concentration \nof BDE-99 to BDE-47 in the upper most 10 cm of all the cores may also be due to the \npreferential degradation of BDE-47, in contrast the greater proportion of BDE-47 to \nBDE-99 observed at stations 1, 2, and 6 may be due to changes in local source input. \n \nAcknowledgements \nSincere appreciation is expressed to Staff at the Scottish Environment Protection \nAgency (SEPA) and particularly captain Hugh Anderson and technicians John \nDerrick and James Glendinning of the SEPA vessel \u2018Endrick II\u2019.
