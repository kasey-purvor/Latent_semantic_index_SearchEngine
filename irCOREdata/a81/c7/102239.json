This \nfuel cell uses an activated carbon cloth + carbon fibre veil composite anode, air-breathing \ndual cathodes and the sulfate-reducing species Desulfovibrio desulfuricans. 1.16 g dm-3 \nsulfite and 0.97 g dm-3 thiosulfate were removed from the wastewater at 22oC, \nrepresenting sulfite and thiosulfate removal conversions of 91% and 86%, respectively. \nThe anode potential was controlled by the concentration of sulfide in the compartment.  \nThe performance of the cathode assembly was affected by the concentration of protons in \nthe cation-exchanging ionomer with which the electrocatalyst is co-bound at the three-\nphase (air, catalyst, support) boundary.  \n \n \n \nKeywords: Microbial fuel cell; Anode; Cathode; Sulfur pollutants; bacteria   \n \n 3\n1. Introduction \nWaste treatment and electricity generation are both key issues for sustainable modern \nsocieties. Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are attracting increased attention, driven by the \ndemands for clean and renewable energy resources, and especially for their potential to \ndirectly recover electricity from various wastewaters.  \nSulfite and thiosulfate pollutants are commonly found in wastewaters, which are \ngenerated by processes such as dye and detergent manufacture, bleach and photographic \nindustries etc.; these pollutants cause numerous adverse effects e.g. generating corrosive \nacid rain and toxic acidic gas, destroying aquatic ecosystems (Lens et al., 2000). Sulfate-\nreducing bacteria (SRB), which use sulfur compounds as energy source, are a diverse \ngroup of bacteria widely distributed in anaerobic marine and terrestrial environments \n(Widdel et al., 1984). SRBs play a key role in the global sulfur cycle e.g. removing much \nof the approximately 1011 kg of oceanic sulfate that is discharged each year from river run-\noff (Battersby et al., 1988). MFCs researching use of SRB have been reported (Habermann \net al 1991; Cooney et al 1996). Recently, we have clarified the anode reaction mechanism: \nthe generation of electricity is mainly from the oxidation of biologically produced sulfide \nto elemental sulfur (soluble polysulfides) (Zhao et al., 2008). An enhanced power output \nand a high removal efficiency of sulfate were achieved with the use of activated carbon \ncloth (ACC) as anode. There has been no wider report of MFCs including investigation of \nthe removal of sulfite and thiosulfate, major environmental pollutants and ubiquitous in \nwastewaters.  \nIn comparison to other abiotic cathode reactions, the reduction of molecular oxygen is \nthe best choice both for chemical fuel cells and for MFCs, because the reduction product is \nclean, non-polluting H2O. However, MFC operation differs from that of chemical fuel \ncells; MFCs needlow ion concentrations and neutral pH,  the normally optimal conditions \n 4\nfor metabolic activity of microbes. The potential of a cathode immersed in air-purged \nsolution has been reported (Zhao et al., 2005, 2006), and the performance for oxygen \nreduction reaction is strongly influenced by proton and phosphate ion concentrations. \nOxygen reduction potentials can be calculated via the Nernst equation. When T = 22 oC \nand the partial pressure of oxygen p = 0.21 atm, that potential is given by: \npHVEORR 058.022.1\/ \u2212=                                           equation (1) \nThe \u201cideal\u201d cathode potential is 0.81 V when the pH of solution is 7.0, but in practice it \nlies in the range 0.5 \u2013 0.6 V; the values are always lower than the theoretical value due to \nmixed potential effects and to the presence of contaminating species. Two types of air-\nbreathing cathodes have been reported recently with either a membrane-less cathode or a \nmembrane cathode assembly (Liu et al., 2004; Cheng et al., 2006). In related studies, air-\nbreathing cathodes, where atmospheric oxygen serves as oxidant, sometimes showed \ndifferent performance with immersed cathodes: lower potentials e.g. 0.027 V (Fan et al., \n2007; Liu et al., 2004). Hence there is an issue. Why did these air-breathing cathodes \nshow very different performance with same operational conditions? The factors affecting \nair-breathing cathode potentials need to be further investigated.  \nIn this study, Desulfovibrio desulfuricans was used for sulfite and thiosulfate reduction \nin artificial wastewater; the metabolism of SRBs is not restricted to sulfate reduction and \nmany species can produce sulfide by reduction of sulfite and thiosulfate (Dannenberg et \nal., 1992). A one chamber, air-breathing dual cathode MFC configuration was designed \nfor obtaining high power outputs and achieving efficient sulfite and thiosulfate removal. \nThe factors affecting the potentials of the anode and the cathode assembly were studied, \nwhich are very important for MFC\u2019s performance.  \n \n \n 5\n2. Experimental section \n2.1 Microbial culture and artificial wastewater.  \nDesulfovibrio desulfuricans was purchased from the German Collection of \nMicroorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany. D. desulfuricans cultures \nwere elaborated as described previously (Zhao et al., 2008).  \nThe artificial wastewater used in the MFC experiments was composed of (per dm3): \nsodium lactate (8.0 g), yeast extract (1.0 g), Na2SO3 (2.0 g), Na2S2O3.5H2O (2.5 g), \nFeSO4.7H2O (0.004 g), MgSO4.7H2O (0.06 g), KH2PO4 (0.5 g), NH4Cl (1 g), CaCl2.6H2O \n(0.06 g), sodium citrate (0.3 g), sodium thioglycolate (0.1 g) and ascorbic acid (0.1 g). The \nwastewater pH was adjusted to 7.5 with NaOH (aq, 2 mol dm-3) prior to autoclaving at \n121oC for 15 min.  \n \n2.2 Ion chromatography for sulfur compounds concentrations.  \nA Dionex DX-100 ion chromatograph with an ED 40 electrochemical detector was used to \ndetermine the concentration of sulfate, sulfite and thiosulfate anions in the wastewater \nafter 22 h of MFC operation. Samples from the chamber were collected and filtered using \na syringe filter of pore size 0.45 \u00b5m prior to the test. The eluent was Na2CO3 (3.5 mmol \ndm-3) + NaHCO3 (1.0 mmol dm-3), a buffer solution.  \n \n2.3 Anode surface area and pore size measurements. \nActivated carbon cloth (CTEX-20) was obtained from MAST Carbon Advanced Products \nLtd. UK. Carbon fibre veil (CFV) was supplied by Technical Fibre Products Limited, UK. \nACC and CFV samples for nitrogen sorption analysis at 77 K were first out-gassed at \n60oC for 48 hours using a Micromeritics Flowprep 060 before transferring to a \nMicromeritics Gemini V Surface Area and Pore Size Analyser. Isotherms were used to \n 6\ncalculate the specific surface areas through application of the BET model (Brunauer et al., \n1938), a widely adopted data reduction technique linking the amount of physically \nadsorbed gas and specific surface area of a material; the total pore volume and the pore \nsize distributions were calculated using the BJH method (Barrett et al., 1951). \n \n2.4 Scanning Electron Microscopy.  \nA Hitachi S2300 SEM was used to characterize the anode (pre-test and post-test) with an \nacceleration voltage of 10 kV. For pre-test, ACC was cut into pieces of 0.5-1.0 cm2 in \nsize. For post-test, the anode was removed from the anaerobic chamber after MFC \noperation, and stored overnight at 30oC in air. \n \n2.5 Electrochemical measurements.  \nELAT cathode material (E-TEK division of BASF) was coated with Nafion ionomer (5% \ndispersion) and dried in air to a constant Nafion loading of 0.5 mg cm-2. The air-breathing \ncathode assembly was fabricated by pressing the ELAT to a Nafion-115 membrane with \n120 kg cm-2 force at 135\u00b0C for 3 min as described previously (Zhao et al., 2008). \nGalvanodynamic polarization experiments of the cathode assembly were performed as \nbefore (Zhao et al., 2006). Open circuit potentials (OCP) of the anodes and the cathode \nassembly as a function of time were individually recorded (all versus a Ag\/AgCl electrode \nas reference) using a digital multi-meter (Integra 2700 series with 7700 multiplexer, \nKeithley Instruments, Inc., U.S.A.) interfaced to a personal computer for data collection. \nFor OCP studies of cathode: the cathode assembly was placed at one end of MFC chamber \nwith the electrode in contact with the air supply (this constituting an air-breathing cathode \nsystem) and the membrane in contact with bacteria-free phosphate buffer (pH 7.0, 50 \nmmol dm-3) in the compartment; a Ag\/AgCl reference electrode was immersed in the \n 7\nbuffer. For OCP tests of anodes, ACC and CFV anodes and a Ag\/AgCl reference electrode \nwere immersed in artificial wastewater.  \nThe ohmic internal resistance (mixture of electronic\/ionic and contact resistances) \n(Varcoe et al., 2006) of the MFC and the electronic conductivity of the ACC and the CFV \nwere determined using electrochemical impedance spectrometry using a Solartron \nAnalytical 1260 frequency response analyser in conjunction with a Solartron Analytical \n1287 potentiostat\/galvanostat in the frequency range 1 MHz \u2013 10 Hz and with a \nperturbation signal of 10 mV rms. The electronic conductivity of the ACC and the CFV \nanode materials were measured with two parallel probes (Zhao et al., 2004a, 2004b) (two \ncopper electrodes of diameter 7.0 mm) in a \u201csandwich\u201d configuration (Cu\/ACC\/Cu or \nCu\/CFV\/Cu) held together by a spring in a test cell to ensure constant and reproducible \ncontact pressure.  \n \n2.6 Microbial fuel cell construction and operation.  \nA single chamber, air-breathing dual cathode assembly, and continuous flow type MFC \nwas constructed in Perspex as shown in Fig. 1. The ACC (60 cm2) and CFV (80 cm2) were \nfolded together as the composite anode, and a long titanium wire was knitted into the \nanode to provide a connection terminal. Taking into account the anode surface area, two \nair-breathing cathode assemblies (each with geometric area of 9 cm2) were used. A \nAg\/AgCl reference electrode was used to record the individual electrode potential. Rubber \ngaskets were used to prevent leakage. The chamber was 2 cm deep, 3 cm wide and 3 cm \nhigh (volume 18 cm3), and the total liquid volume was 9 cm3 after the anode was placed in \nthe chamber. \nFor fuel cell operation, the MFC was operated in a recycled flow batch mode: 1 cm3 of \nD. desulfuricans culture was inoculated into 100 cm3 artificial wastewater in a serum \n 8\nbottle for 3 days at 22oC. The wastewater was then continuously pumped from the bottle \nto the chamber. The MFC potential and current were recorded with an external load of 20 \nohm. \nAll electrochemical experiments and MFC operations reported in this paper were \ncarried out at 22.0 \u00b1 0.5oC, and all potentials of three-electrode systems were converted to \nthe standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) reference scale unless otherwise stated. Fuel cell \nvoltage and current were tested in 2-electrode mode by connection of anode and cathode \nacross the load.  \n \n3. Results and Discussions \n3.1 Characterization of ACC and CFV anode materials. \nSurface area and morphology of anodes are important for MFC performance, especially \nwhen elemental sulfur is to be deposited on the anode. The SEM images show that ACC is \nsimilar in form to industrial textiles on a macroscopic scale (Fig. 2a) and is composed of \nmulti-fibre threads (Fig. 2b). The inset shows the morphological structure of the individual \nfibres, with diameters in the range of 10 \u2013 15 \u00b5m; ridges were observed in the axial \ndirection and a slit cylindrical structure. BET analysis (Table 1, supporting data) yields \nSBET = 1038 m2 g-1 for the ACC material and SBET < 0.3 m2 g-1 for CFV, which indicates \nthat ACC has massively larger micro-porosity and specific surface area compared to CFV \nof the same geometric area. A high surface area is important for anode performance (to \nslow performance losses with time) for this system where solid sulfur, one of the products \nof sulfide oxidation, is deposited on the anode surface. \nThe electrical conductivity of the electrode material has an effect on the internal \nresistance of the MFC. S-Table 1 (supporting data) show the electrical conductivity of \ncompressed ACC was higher than that of CFV. However, it should be noted that the ACC \n 9\nconductivity was highly dependent on the pressure applied by the copper electrodes, ACC \nbeing composed of loosely packed multi-fibres in a textile form. When the ACC was \nunder light pressure, the conductivity (~ 0.01 S cm-1) was lower than that reported; this \nresults from the then poorer contact between individual fibres and would be the case in a \nsimple MFC anode. The conductivity of both materials is less than for metals, but taking \ninto account the material thickness (0.55 mm for ACC and 0.10 mm for CFT), the \nresistances along the thickness direction are quite low. For application as the anode in the \nMFC tests, the ACC was therefore folded around a single CFV sheet and held folded by a \nlong titanium wire (CFV + Ti then contribute to current collection feeding into the eternal \ncircuit). The ohmic internal resistance of the MFC was 9.5 ohm, a low value in MFC \nstudies. \n \n3.2 Cathode potential measurements in a half-cell.  \nFig. 3 shows the OCP of the cathode assembly measured as a function of time; the \nsolution in the chamber in contact with the membrane was pH 7.0 buffer. At the beginning \nof the test, a potential of 0.9 V was obtained, higher than results in previous studies (0.027 \nV and 0.31 V; Fan et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2004). This is because ELAT electrode used was \ncoated with a film of Nafion ionomer when the cathode assembly was prepared. This is a \nstandard procedure for chemical H2\/air PEM fuel cells to ensure enhanced catalyst-\nmembrane contact and to decrease ohmic drop at cathodes. The Nafion ionomer has \nperfluorinated pendant side-chains terminating in strongly acidic sulfonic groups (\u2013SO3H). \nThese hydrated proton exchange sites are in contact with the Pt catalyst and are extremely \nacidic, hence the cathode potential of 0.9 V was observed. In this case, the membrane \ncathode assembly shows better performance than that of membrane-less cathodes. \n 10\nCations (e.g. Na+, K+) in the neutral buffer are present in far higher concentration (0.05 \nmol dm-3) than protons (10-7 mol dm-3) and will slowly diffuse through the membrane by \nion exchange to the negatively charged sulfonic groups of ionomer, yielding \u2013SO3-M+. \nThe environment surrounding the cathode catalyst moves to higher pH (neutral), \nexplaining the cathode potential decreased to 0.63 V at t = 500 h. The inset of Fig. 3 \nshows the galvanodynamic polarizations of the cathode assembly at 0 h and 500 h, \nrespectively; the current at 0.2 V decreased from 1.96 to 0.53 mA, due to the decrease \nboth of OCP and of the concentration of protons surrounding the catalyst. The potential \nrecovered to 0.9 V after immersing the cathode assembly in H2SO4(aq), as expected.  \nThe cathode assembly in Fig. 3 was studied in OCP mode (zero current), where the drop \nin the potential was only driven by the exchange between cations and proton surrounding \nthe catalysts. When a cathode assembly is used in a MFC, the cathode potential would \ndecrease at a more rapid rate due to the additional H+ loss\/consumption caused by the \noxygen reduction reaction (ORR). After 3 repeated recordings of power vs. current \npolarisation using external resistances as controlled loads, the cathodic OCP recovered to \n0.50 \u2013 0.66 V, in line with the expected cathode potential in neutral solution. The results \nshow that the acid-form Nafion ionomer initially at the catalyst allows the cathode \nassembly to achieve a high performance, but for MFC long-term operation a continuous \nsupply of protons would be better. \nTo obtain high coulombic efficiency and to avoid bio-fouling of cathodes, different \nmembrane types proton (Zhao et al., 2006) or cation exchange membranes (Rabaey et al., \n2005), anion exchange membranes (Kim et al., 2007), bipolar membranes (Heijne et al., \n2006), glass wool (Mohan et al., 2008) and nano-porous filters (Biffinger et al., 2007) have \nbeen used as separator in MFCs, but none of those membranes can prevent the cathode pH \nrising during fuel cell operation (Harnisch et al., 2008). Keeping the desired pH conditions \n 11\naround cathode catalysts for the ORR represents a significant research challenge, not only \nfor cathodes immersed in air purged solutions but also for air-breathing cathodes. A \ncomparison of the different membrane types, not considering the cost of materials, leads to \nthe following conclusions:  \n\u2022 proton and other cation exchange membranes are the best choice for treatment of \npollutant anions (i.e. NO3-, HS-), both provide proton and cation transport from \nanode chamber to cathode part;  \n\u2022 anion exchange membranes are unsuitable for anionic pollutants treatment as \nanions easily transfer through the membrane and cross-over can happen, especially \nas platinum poisoning reaction will result. Moreover, OH- ions easily pass through \nthe membrane and might lead to pH rise in the environment surrounding the \ncathode catalyst;  \n\u2022 extra energy is required for water splitting reaction to obtain transport of H+ and \nOH- ions when bipolar membranes are used in MFCs; higher MFCs current is \nachieved and more extra energy will be required;  \n\u2022 membrane-less air cathodes are unsuitable for the sulfur pollutants systems \nbecause leakage of sulfide can easily occur. \nA periodic cleaning of the cathode assembly may be necessary, as salt crystal formation \nis observed on the catalyst side of the cathode. The accumulation of salt crystals would \nresult in blocking both oxygen diffusion and proton transport, such that the cathode \nperformance decreases. In this study, the cathode assembly was regenerated in H2SO4(aq) \nduring the removal of the anode for recovery of elemental sulfur.  \n \n3.3 Anode potential measurements in a half-cell.  \n 12\nBacterial cells can attach to surface of electrodes and form a continuous biofilm, which \nhas an important effect on anode potential of MFCs (Aelterman et al., 2008). The OCPs \nfor ACC and CFV versus reference electrode were recorded as a function of time in a half \ncell as shown in Fig. 4. Upon inoculation with 1 cm3 D. desulfuricans culture, the \nequilibrium potentials of the ACC and the CFV were 0.09 V and -0.01 V, respectively. \nBoth potentials shifted to negative values with time despite the differing natures of the \ncarbon based materials (0 \u2013 56 h in Fig. 5). After 60 h, the potential dropped slowly for the \nACC but stabilized at approximately -0.25 V in the case of CFV. As with the cathode \nassembly, the change of electrode potentials can also be explained by Nernstian behaviour. \npK1 for sulfide is 6.9 and the predominant species in neutral solution are therefore HS- and \nH2S. It should be noted that the pH of the solution is an important parameter for \ndetermining the sulfide oxidation potential because a proton concentration term is required \nfor Nernstian thermodynamics. The following oxidation potentials apply at pH 7.0: \nH2S = S + 2H+ + 2e-                  SH\no aVE\n2\nlog029.0271.0\/ \u2212\u2212=           (2) \nHS- = S + H+ + 2e-                   \u2212\u2212\u2212= HSo aVE log029.0266.0\/           (3) \nwhere a is the activity concentration of sulfide. After inoculation into the sealed chamber, \nD. desulfuricans cells produce sulfide by reducing the sulfite and thiosulfate in the \nwastewater. The accumulation of sulfide (increase in concentration) led to the shift of the \nequilibrium electrode potential of both ACC and CFV towards more negative values \naccording to the equations (2) and (3). However, bio-reduction pathways for the sulfur \ncompounds are inhibited by high sulfide concentration (Reis et al., 1992). When the \naccumulation of sulfide reached a \u201cbreakout point\u201d, at which biological reduction of \nsulfate almost ceased and sulfide producing process stopped, hence the potential of the \nCFV electrode remained at -0.25 V after 60 h. The potential of the ACC electrode, \nhowever, slowly shifted from -0.25 V at 60 h to -0.27 V at 140 h, the sulfide in the \n 13\nwastewater being strongly adsorbed in the ACC micropores. The higher sulfide \nconcentration on the ACC active surface resulted in the observed potential difference of -\n0.02 V compared to that of the CFV; the more negative anode potential leads to a higher \ntheoretical electrical energy release from the MFCs. These results indicate that ACC, with \nmicro-porous structure (high surface area) for sulfide adsorption, is a superior material as \nan anode for sulfide removal with simultaneous electricity generation in a MFC.  \nIn order to investigate if the anodic potential was affected by biofilm, D. desulfuricans \nwas inoculated in artificial wastewater in a sealed serum bottle. After 3 days, this \nwastewater was pumped to the MFC; a change of anodic potential was immediately \nobserved, and stabilized at ~ -0.25 V after a few minutes. These results include little \npossibility for biofilm formation, because the residence time of the bacteria in the MFC \nwas too short for the cells to attach to the anode surface. Moreover, the same change of \npotential can be reproduced by adding sulfide to a bacteria-free buffer. Hence, it can be \nconcluded that the anode potential was controlled by the sulfide concentration in \nwastewater and not by a biofilm. \nFor MFCs studies, there have been no detailed mechanism studies concerning the \ninfluence of metabolites on anode potential when only inert materials (e.g. carbon cloth or \ngraphite etc.) are used as anode. Our results indicate that redox active metabolites in \nsolution can affect anode potential. In future studies, considerable attention will be \nrequired regarding the factors that affect electrode potential, because not only the biofilm \non the electrode surface but also the metabolites in solution affect the anode potential. \n \n3.4 MFC performance tests.  \nThe biological sulfide-generating process will almost stop when the accumulation of \nsulfide reaches a \u201cbreakout point\u201d, but the power output of the MFC is dependent on \n 14\nsulfide concentration: the higher the concentration, the higher the power output (Zhao et \nal., 2008; Ieropoulos et al., 2005). It is very important to determine the \u201cbalance point\u201d \n(beyond which a higher level of sulfide production will inhibit the biological reduction of \nsulfate), which gives the maximum power. In this study, the concentration of sulfide from \nmetabolism was observed by anode OCP change. When the OCP reached -0.24 V it \nindicated the concentration had nearly reached maximum (~ -0.26 V); the wastewater was \nthen pumped into the MFC chamber and a high power output was obtained. The sulfide \nwas rapidly oxidized at the anode, causing a sharp decrease in its concentration, allowing \nsulfite and thiosulfate to be continuously biologically reduced and to be finally removed \nfrom the wastewater. \nBased on the polarization tests with different external loads, the power output achieved \na maximum value at the external load of 20 ohm; hence, this load was used to investigate \nthe MFC performance as a function of time. Fig. 5 shows the current vs. time performance \nof the MFC operated in a batch mode. A maximum current of 16.1 mA was obtained at \n500 s, when the operation of MFC was switched from open circuit to an external load of \n20 ohm. In the switching process, the cathode showed a higher potential change when \ncompared to that for the anode, the potential change of the cathode was 0.55 V and for the \nanode potential was 0.08 V, increasing cathode surface area could enhance power output. \nThe current quickly dropped from 16 mA to 10 mA in the following 200 s, then decreased \nmore slowly as the cell voltage decreased slowly. The anode potential shift was faster than \nthat of the cathode, resulting in a decreasing MFC voltage. A power output of 2.68 mW \nwas obtained at 9.8 mA, where the electrons at the anode were from electrochemical \noxidation of sulfide. The cathode and the sulfide concentration was the major limiting \nfactor in this process; using an anaerobic reservoir for sulfide accumulation combined with \nMFC technology could lead to an enhanced power output. \n 15\nWhen the current of MFC had decreased to 0.6 mA, the concentration of sulfur \ncompounds in the wastewater was detected. Table 1 shows the concentration change and \nthe removal efficiency before and after 22 h of MFC operation. No sulfate was detected in \nthe sample solution. 1.16 g dm-3 sulfite and 0.97 g dm-3 thiosulfate were removed from the \nwastewater, corresponding to conversions of 91% for sulfite and 86% for thiosulfate, \nrespectively.  \n \n4. Conclusions  \nIn this system, most sulfide was electrochemically oxidized to sulfur (polysulfides) by the \nanode. A small amount of sulfide was oxidized to forms with higher sulfur oxidation states \n(oxoanions) that could be reduced again by bacteria to sulfide, only in this case sulfide can \nbe considered as mediator of electron transfer reaction. Elemental sulfur on anode surface \nmight also be reduced by bacteria; sulfate and sulfite etc. may be produced by bacterial \noxidation and\/or disproportionation reactions. In this complex multivariate system, the \nresults indicate the limiting factor is the slowly biological reactions. \nThe factors that affect the cathode and anode potentials were investigated. Compared \nwith other membrane types, proton (cation) exchange membrane and Nafion ionomer at \nthe catalyst enable the cathode assembly to achieve high performance. The anode \nperformance is controlled by the sulfide concentration; this system might be useful in \napplications of MFC type biosensor for sulfide determination in wastewater (Gil et al., \n2003). \nSulfur species were nearly completely removed from the wastewater during MFC \noperation. This approach represents a potential solution for simultaneous electricity \nproduction and removal of sulfur-based pollutants (including organic sulfur compounds if \n 16\nthey are reducible to sulfide by bacteria), and offers a technological tool both for \nsustainable energy generation and for economic and efficient removal of sulfur pollutants.  \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis research was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research \nCouncil (UK) as part of the Supergen5 Biological Fuel Cells Consortium (EPSRC \ncontract: EP\/D047943\/1).
