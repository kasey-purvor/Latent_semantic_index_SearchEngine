Shape\nisomers arise when a metastable state decays to a state with\na different shape and it is difficult to rearrange the nuclear\nconfiguration [2]. Spin traps occur due to the spin selec-\ntion rules. The decay path to lower energy states requires\na large change of the nuclear spin, and therefore the emis-\nsion of g rays with a high multipolarity which is strongly\nhindered [3]. The third type of isomer, known as a \u201cK\ntrap,\u201d is caused by the necessity to change the nuclear spin\norientation relative to an axis of symmetry. K is a quantum\nnumber that represents the projection of the total nuclear\nspin along the symmetry axis of the nucleus. This type\nof isomer arises only in axially symmetric, well-deformed\nprolate nuclei, which means thatK is a good quantum num-\nber. A number of such states have been established in the\nHf-W-Os nuclei in the mass A \u0004 180 region.\nThe Z \u0001 74 W nuclei are known to exhibit substantial\nprolate deformations \u0002b2 \u0004 0.25\u0003 in their ground states\n[4]. These were deduced from Coulomb excitation ex-\nperiments, in which the reduced transition probabilities\n(the transition quadrupole moments) of the first excited 21\nstates in even-even 180 186W isotopes were measured. The\npresent experiments provide for the first time a direct mea-\nsurement of a static quadrupole moment in the 74W nuclei.\nThis paper addresses the following question: Is there\na difference between the deformation of the nuclei in\ntheir ground states and in their high-seniority multi-\nquasiparticle excitations. The importance of this question\nis related to the question of the quenching of the pairing\ncorrelations in atomic nuclei. The usual approach is by\nstudying the rotational bands, which are built on the K604 0031-9007\u000101\u000186(4)\u0001604(4)$15.00isomer, to deduce the moment of inertia and compare it to\nthat of the ground-state (fully paired) rotational band [5].\nYet, the moment of inertia depends on both the deforma-\ntion and the pairing, which requires that the deformation\nbe determined experimentally. Prior to our experiments,\nonly the quadrupole moments of the high-K isomers in\n182Os \u0002Kp \u0001 251\u0003 [6], 178Hf \u0002Kp \u0001 161\u0003 [7,8], and\n177Lu \u0002Kp \u0001 232 2\u0003 [9] were known, with deformations\nwhich where deduced to be similar to the ground-state val-\nues. However, in the case of 182Os, if we use r0 \u0001 1.2 fm\nto deduce the nuclear radius (r0 \u0001 1.1 fm was used in\nRef. [6]), we find a considerable difference between\nthe ground-state and isomeric deformations, which is\nconsistent with recent theoretical calculations [10].\nThe 170Er\u000213C, 4n\u0003179W reaction at a beam energy of\n63 MeV has been used to populate the K \u0001 352 isomer\nin 179W. A thin self-supporting, 98% enriched, 170Er\n500 mg\u0001cm2 target was used in the experiment. The tar-\nget thickness was chosen to allow 90% of the 179W nuclei\nto recoil out of the target. They were in-beam implanted\ninto a thick Tl polycrystalline foil, which served as a level-\nmixing spectroscopy (LEMS) host and as a beam stopper.\nThe experiments were performed at the CYCLONE cy-\nclotron at Louvain-la-Neuve, using the LEMS technique\n[11\u201313]. The experimental setup consists of a split-coil\n4.4 T superconducting magnet, a target holder, allowing\nprecise temperature control at the target position in the in-\nterval 4\u2013600 K, and 4 Ge detectors, which monitor the\ntarget through the holes of the magnet. They are posi-\ntioned at 0\u00b1 and 90\u00b1 with respect to the beam axis [11].\nThe magnetic field was oriented parallel to the beam axis.\nEarlier stages of this work were reported in Ref. [14].\u00a9 2001 The American Physical Society\nVOLUME 86, NUMBER 4 P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S 22 JANUARY 2001The theory of the LEMS method was described in detail\nin Refs. [11\u201313]. It has been shown that the method gives\nresults that are compatible with other techniques and in\nmany cases more appropriate to apply [15,16]. In this Let-\nter we report the first application of this method to study\na deformed nucleus. The method can be understood as\nfollows: in a fusion-evaporation reaction, an oriented en-\nsemble of nuclei of interest is produced in their isomeric\nstates. The spins of these nuclei lie in a plain, which is\nperpendicular to the beam axis. The recoiling nuclei are\nimplanted in a suitable host, where they are submitted to\na combined electric quadrupole and magnetic dipole in-\nteraction. The anisotropy of the g radiation is measured\nas a function of the magnetic field strength. At zero field\nonly the electric quadrupole interaction is present, which is\ncaused by the interaction between the nuclear quadrupole\nmoment and the lattice electric field gradient (EFG). The\ninitial orientation of the nuclear spin ensemble is disturbed\nbecause the direction of the EFG is misaligned with respect\nto the orientation plane. Because of this perturbation, the\nanisotropy of the emitted g radiation changes. At high\nmagnetic fields (several tesla), the electric quadrupole in-\nteraction becomes negligible compared with the magnetic\ndipole interaction. The latter causes a Larmor precession\nof the nuclear spins around the magnetic field vector \u0002B. As\nthe precession axis coincides with the beam axis, this re-\nsults in preservation of the initial orientation of the nuclear\nspin ensemble. As a result, the initial anisotropy of the g\nradiation is measured. In the intermediate regime, both in-\nteractions compete, and a smooth change takes place at a\nfield that depends on the ratio of the quadrupole interaction\nfrequency to the magnetic moment of the isomer. Parallel\nto our experiments, a TDPAD measurement was performed\nat the Australian National University (Canberra) in which\nthe magnetic moment of this isomer was derived, yielding\na value m \u0001 8.31\u00028\u0003mN [17].\nThe choice of a suitable host material is crucial for\nthe LEMS experiments, since the measured quadrupole\nfrequency depends on both the nuclear quadrupole mo-\nment and the EFG of the material as nQ \u0001\ne\nhQsVzz . For\nthe LEMS experiments, which are described here, a 81Tl\nhost was chosen. Tl has a hexagonal structure (hcp)\nfor temperatures below 503 K, and a cubic (bcc) lattice\nfor temperatures above it. The lattice of 81Tl is close\nto the ideal crystal and the EFGs of different atoms\nsitting at substitutional sites are known to be small [18].\nIt is also well known that, in the hpc phase, the EFG\nof Tl is strongly temperature dependent and decreases\nwith temperature [19]. Quantitatively, the temperature\ndependence of noncubic metals follows the T3\u00012 law:\nVzz\u0002T \u0003 \u0001 Vzz\u00020\u0003 ? \u00021 2 bT3\u00012\u0003 [20,21]. The LEMS\nexperiment was carried out at T \u0001 473\u00021\u0003 K. The host\nwas heated, which aimed at two goals: to reduce the EFG\nof WTl, and to anneal defects in the Tl host, possibly\ncreated during the in-beam implantation. We performed\ntheoretical band-structure calculations based on den-\nsity-functional theory using the full-potential linearizedaugmented plane wave (LAPW) method as implemented\nin the WIEN97 package [22]. In order to test the accuracy\nof the calculations, the EFG of TlTl was derived first.\nAn experimental value Vzz\u0002TlTl\u0003 \u0001 1.7\u00023\u0003 3 1021 V\u0001m2\nat 293 K was measured for this system and the EFG\nwas shown to follow the T3\u00012 law [19]. The temperature\ndependence factor b \u0001 7.0\u000211\u0003 3 1025 K23\u00012 was also\nmeasured. These yield an extrapolated value Vzz\u0002TlTl\u0003 \u0001\n2.3\u00024\u0003 3 1021 V\u0001m2 at 0 K, which was nicely reproduced\nby the LAPW calculations. Next, the 74W impurity in hcp\nTl was simulated by a 54 atom \u00023 3 3 3 3\u0003 supercell\napproach, allowing full structural relaxation of three shells\nof neighboring atoms. Spin-orbit interaction was included\nin the calculation because of the heavy nuclei involved.\nThe EFG was derived from the self-consistent charge\ndensity without further approximations [23], and a value\nof Vzz\u0002WTl\u0003 \u0001 2.54 3 1021 V\u0001m2 at 0 K was obtained.\nA dedicated experiment was performed to measure the\ntemperature dependence factor b. This study of the EFG\nof WTl is described in more detail in Ref. [24]. A value of\nb \u0001 7.6\u000210.220.4\u0003 3 1025 K23\u00012 was derived, resulting in a\nvalue Vzz\u0002WTl\u0003 \u0001 0.55\u000210.1220.08\u0003 3 1021 V\u0001m2 for the EFG\nat 473 K, accepting the T3\u00012 temperature dependence of\nthe EFG. The large statistical uncertainty on this value is\ndue to the parabolic behavior of the error bar, caused by\nthe T3\u00012 functional dependence. In addition, a theoretical\nuncertainty of 10% for the LAPW calculation is taken into\nconsideration. This is based on our previous experience\n[25,26], where the quadrupole moments of 57Fe, 77Se, and\n100Rh were determined by using a combination of theo-\nretical EFG calculations and measurements of quadrupole\nfrequencies.\nSince a time-integrated curve is measured in a LEMS\nexperiment, single g-ray spectra were recorded. The 179W\nK \u0001 352 isomer is a suitable case to study, because about\n50% of the g decay of the high-spin states, which are\nexcited in heavy-ion fusion-evaporation reactions, goes\nthrough the isomer which appears to decay predominantly\nto the n\u0005514\u0006 722 ground-state band [27]. The prompt\nbackground radiation was reduced with the help of the\nbeam-pulsing system which was tuned to provide a beam\npulse every 500 ns. A 400 ns time gate was set 100 ns\nafter the beam burst. By accumulating ten spectra per\nmagnetic field, the statistical uncertainties of the intensi-\nties of the g rays of interest could be reduced below 3%.\nDead-time corrections were made for the individual de-\ntectors. A sample spectrum which displays the delayed g\nrays in 179W is shown in Fig. 1.\nThe LEMS curve, which is presented in Fig. 2, was ob-\ntained in this experiment. The anisotropy for the 609,\n565, and 358 keV E2 transitions, which follow the de-\ncay of the K \u0001 352 isomer, was determined at different\nmagnetic fields. The data were analyzed in several ways:\nby fitting the LEMS curves with and without averaging\nthe data-points obtained in different spectra. All fits con-\nverge within the statistical accuracy. A quadrupole fre-\nquency nQ \u0001 53\u00028\u0003 MHz was deduced.

It results in a more\ncomplete analysis of the experimental data in which the\nsystematic errors which are due to, for example, beam fluc-\ntuations were taken into account. The Tl host was heated to\na temperature above 503 K during the experiments which\nallows the full anisotropy of the g rays to be measured di-\nrectly. In that case no EFG is present, because the crystal\nlattice is symmetric and the initial orientation of the nu-\nclear spin ensemble is kept over the full field range. This\nallows one to conclude that decoupling was reached in the\nexperiment.\nThus, the spectroscopic quadrupole moment of the K \u0001\n35\n2 isomer in 179W is found to be Qs \u0001 4.00\u0002\n10.83\n21.06\u0003e b.\nAccepting that K is a good quantum number, the measured\nspectroscopic quadrupole moment is related to the intrinsic\nquadrupole moment, Q0, through the relation\nQs \u0001 Q0\n3K2 2 I\u0002I 1 1\u0003\n\u00022I 1 3\u0003 \u0002I 1 1\u0003\n.

Assuming\nthat gR \u0001 0.30\u00025\u0003, consistent with the systematics of the\nregion [28], and taking into consideration the measured\nmagnetic moment of m \u0001 8.31\u00028\u0003mN for this state [17], a\nvalue Q0 \u0001 3.9\u00021.5\u0003e b was found. These results demon-\nstrate that the measured values for the quadrupole moments\nof the high-K isomers in 179W and 182Os do not fit the sys-\ntematic trends, which were observed for the ground-state\nmoments in the region [4].\nIn the lower part of Fig. 3 the systematic theoretical pre-\ndictions for the ground-state deformations of the 74W nu-\nclei [29] are compared to the values obtained from B\u0002E2\u0003\nmeasurements, and to the deduced deformation of the\nK \u0001\n35\n2 isomer in 179W. Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov cal-\nculations within the framework of the tilted axis cranking\n(TAC) theory [33] permit us to take into account possible\nconsequences of the mixing between bands with differ-\nent K values. Such effects were found to be small. TAC\nyields a value for the quadrupole moment of this isomer\nQs \u0001 5.73e b if pairing is treated with the particle number\nprojection (PNP) technique [34] and Qs \u0001 5.84e b with-\nout it (the neutron pairing is zero in this case). These values\nof the quadrupole moment correspond to an axially sym-\nmetric nucleus with deformations e2 \u0001 0.228 and e4 \u0001\n0.038, which coincide with the calculated ground-state de-\nformations for 179W: e2 \u0001 0.226 and e4 \u0001 0.039 and con-\ntradict the measured quadrupole moment for the isomer.\nIndependent calculations of the total Routhian surfaces\n[10] also give very similar deformations for the ground\nstate and high-K bands. The experimental values, which\nare reported here, are about 2s off the theoretical esti-\nmates. In the case of the six-quasiparticle isomer in 182Os\nthe low value of the spectroscopic quadrupole moment\ncould be understood as being due to triaxiality of the nu-\nclear mean field [10], while in the case of the 352 five-\nquasiparticle isomer in 179W a consistent explanation is\nstill missing. A possible explanation might be related to\nthe fact that, in order to create a high-seniority state, a\nfew particles need to be excited to high-V orbits, which\nare localized close to the equatorial plane of the nucleus.\nThis changes the nuclear mass distribution and influences\nthe symmetries of the mean field. A configuration depen-\ndence in this case cannot be excluded. Similar effects have\nbeen discussed for the nuclei in the Mg region [35].\nIn conclusion, we have measured the quadrupole mo-\nment of the K \u0001 352 , Ei \u0001 3349 keV isomer in 179W. The\ndeduced deformation of this state is smaller compared to\nthe systematic trend of the ground-state deformations of\nthe nuclei in the region, and smaller than the theoretically\npredicted values. Further improvement of the experimen-tal accuracy is probably needed. At the same time the\nexploration of other theoretical aspects is necessary, since\nit seems impossible to explain these differences within the\nwell-established schemes to calculate nuclear deformations\nin this mass region.\nThe authors thank the operation staff of the CYCLONE\naccelerator facility at Louvain-la-Neuve.
