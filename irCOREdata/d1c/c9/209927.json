Welfare services and basic human\nneeds, as well as social protection in the form of safety nets and social\nsafeguards, together form the mainstay of what is generally regarded\nwithin the organization as constituting social policy. Social\ndevelopment reflects a broader if more fragmented view of social\npolicy. Bank specialists have recently sought to widen the definition of\nsocial policy beyond welfare and protection, building upon long-\nstanding academic discourse in this field. However, in attempting to\npursue a more holistic and over-arching vision of social policy for\ndevelopment, they are likely to encounter major internal obstacles.\nMeeting this challenge will not be facilitated by the Bank\nreorganization announced in June 2006, which may serve to restrict\nthe independence and remit of environmental and social specialists.\nkeywords social development, social policy, social protection, social welfare,\nWorld Bank\nA RT I C L E 151\nGlobal Social Policy Copyright \u00a9 2007 1468-0181 vol. 7(2): 151\u2013175; 078160\nSAGE Publications (Los Angeles, London, New Delhi, and Singapore)\nDOI: 10.1177\/1468018107078160 http:\/\/gsp.sagepub.com \ngsp\nIntroduction\nDespite its pioneering role in promoting international development, the World\nBank has not generally been considered a leading overt proponent of social pol-\nicy. The word \u2018overt\u2019 is deliberately employed here because, to a greater or\nlesser extent and in a variety of ways, the institution has clearly exercised a sig-\nnificant influence on the design and execution of social policies in the South\n(Deacon et al., 1997; Yeates, 2001). Yet it is only relatively recently that the term\n at London School of Economics & Political Sciences on September 25, 2012gsp.sagepub.comDownloaded from \n\u2018social policy\u2019 has entered the Bank lexicon. This delay should perhaps come as\nno surprise considering the institution\u2019s traditional mainstream emphasis on\ninfrastructural investment and macro-economic growth. Yet if \u2018social policy\u2019 is\nconceptualized in broader terms than the conventional Organisation for\nEconomic Co-operation and Development (OECD) definition of providing\nstatutory social services, it is evident that a diverse policy-relevant social agenda\nhas emerged within Bank operations over the past three decades. This has taken\nthe shape, for example, of (1) investments in key social sectors such as health,\neducation and pensions, (2) targeted anti-poverty programmes such as safety\nnets, (3) the use of operational tools such as social assessments, poverty and\nsocial impact analysis and poverty reduction strategy papers, and (4) social safe-\nguards designed to mitigate the potentially harmful consequences of infrastruc-\nture projects. Whether applied via budget support through sector-wide loans\n(SWAPs) or through specific projects and programmes, social instruments with\npolicy relevance may thus take various forms.\nIn this context, the article has three aims: (1) to disaggregate strands of\n\u2018social policy\u2019 (in broad terms) thinking and practice within the current work\nof the World Bank, (2) to consider what conceptual, operational and organi-\nzational factors underpin these divisions, and (3) to assess potential implica-\ntions for the future of social policy within the Bank.\nIn World Bank operations, \u2018social development\u2019 has become common cur-\nrency and now has its own Board-approved strategy, Empowering People by\nTransforming Institutions (World Bank, 2005a). At the same time, as noted ear-\nlier, social analysis at micro, sector and macro levels has become an integral\npart of Bank work. Yet the specific term \u2018social policy\u2019 has been employed\ninfrequently. Related terms such as \u2018human development\u2019, \u2018social protection\u2019\nand \u2018social safeguards\u2019 are employed instead. These labels reflect the histori-\ncal accumulation of a diverse social agenda within the Bank during its lifetime,\nreflecting critical junctures in policy making. They refer to a range of social\nactivities that have been developed in different (often competing) segments of\nthe organization, each performing distinctive functions in response to specific\noperational needs and as the result of organizational restructuring.\nSocial Policies in the World Bank: Evolving Agendas\nThree basic strands of social policy are observable in the work of the World\nBank (illustrated in Figure 1). Two of these are well established (social welfare\nand social protection) while the putative third element (social development) is\nof more recent origin. They may be summarized thus:\n\u2022 Social welfare. Following mainstream development traditions, social policy\nin the Bank is often equated with the provision of social welfare services\nin the areas of education, health, nutrition, population and social security\n152 Global Social Policy 7(2)\n at London School of Economics & Political Sciences on September 25, 2012gsp.sagepub.comDownloaded from \nincluding pensions. The underlying rationale is enhancing human capital\nto boost macro-economic growth, which has its intellectual origins in\nmodernization theory. It also reflects the Basic Human Needs approach\nto poverty alleviation established in the 1980s (Stewart, 1985).\n\u2022 Social protection. In the wake of structural adjustment and the move\ntowards the construction of social safety nets targeted at the poorest\ngroups, social policy in the Bank is increasingly seen as being synonymous\nwith social protection. Although social safety nets have long formed part\nof social policy in OECD and other countries, they are becoming popu-\nlar with the Bank and its clients as a tool for tackling absolute poverty.\nThey include measures such as social funds and conditional cash transfer\n(CCT) programmes. This second broad category also embraces the\nBank\u2019s safeguards policies (for example on environmental impacts, invol-\nuntary resettlement and protection of indigenous groups). Designed to\nminimize the potentially negative impacts of Bank-funded projects upon\nlocal populations, these safeguards are sometimes referred to internally as\n\u2018do-no-harm\u2019 social policies. For most Bank staff, therefore, social policy\nis reduced either to welfare and basic needs provision or the protection of\nvulnerable groups through safety nets and safeguards.\n\u2022 Social development. There is, however, a third category of Bank activity that\naccounts for a major portion of Bank funding and which has major social\nramifications. It includes substantial work programmes or clusters of proj-\nects around themes such as community-driven development, social account-\nability, conflict prevention, and participation and civic engagement, among\nothers. This is a loosely grouped social agenda which has evolved incre-\nmentally in an ad hoc fashion as a result of internal restructuring and com-\npetition for resources rather than following any clear rational. The Social\nDevelopment Strategy (World Bank, 2005a) represents an attempt to pro-\nvide some coherence to this agenda. These three facets of Bank social pol-\nicy will now be discussed in more detail.\nSocial Policy as Welfare\nArguably one of the major twin pillars of what many regard as the Bank\u2019s con-\ntribution to social policy is investment in education, health, population and\nnutrition, which falls under the Human Development network (Figure 1).\nEducation and health investments commenced in the 1960s as part of the eco-\nnomic modernization framework, intellectually underpinned by human capi-\ntal theory (Becker, 1964). During the presidency of Robert MacNamara\n(1968\u201381), a third of the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio by value was dedicated to anti-\npoverty initiatives in rural development, health, education and population\nprojects. However, these were still consistent with the Bank\u2019s mainstream\nfocus on economic growth (Ayres, 1984).\nHall: Social Policies in the World Bank 153\n at London School of Economics & Political Sciences on September 25, 2012gsp.sagepub.comDownloaded from \nUnder Tom Clausen (1981\u20136), influenced by the conservatism of Reagan\nand Thatcher as well as disillusionment within the Bank over the apparent\nfailure of MacNamara\u2019s anti-poverty programme to produce visible results,\nthe emphasis on direct poverty reduction through social investments tem-\nporarily diminished as the role of the private sector was heightened and eco-\nnomic growth was once again prioritized (Ayres, 1984). However, the\nmomentum of support continued for pursuing short-term welfare objectives\nand investment in human resources with a poverty focus (for example through\nprimary and basic education, primary health care and nutrition projects),\nwhich were seen as essential for supporting growth and productivity. Building\nupon the human capital concept of the 1950s and 1960s, it was argued that\n154 Global Social Policy 7(2)\n1. SOCIAL\nWELFARE\n2. SOCIAL\nPROTECTION\n3.

Meeting Basic Human Needs was thus a corollary to economic\ngrowth strategies as doubts over the validity of \u2018trickle down\u2019 assumptions\nwere constantly raised (Stewart, 1985). These goals were reflected in the third\nWorld Development Report, which identified \u2018human development\u2019 as a\nprocess that could reconcile welfare and growth as complimentary rather than\ncontradictory agendas (World Bank, 1980).1\nClausen\u2019s successor, Barber Conable (1986\u201391), oversaw a Bank \u2018rededica-\ntion\u2019 to pro-welfare and anti-poverty measures in Bank policy (Kapur et al.,\n1997). Flying in the face of opposition from the US administration, the Bank\ndrew up a new Core Poverty Program (CPP) to tackle hunger in Africa and to\ndeal with the social costs of adjustment. Buttressed by support from UNICEF\nand the call for \u2018adjustment with a human face\u2019 (Cornia et al., 1987), the Bank\nfocused on constructing \u2018safety nets\u2019 using social emergency programmes and\nsocial action funds. At the same time, the message was reinforced that invest-\nment in human resources through health, education and population pro-\ngrammes was good for growth. The Bank\u2019s 13th World Development Report\n(WDR) on the theme of Poverty focused on promoting the productivity of the\npoor while providing them with basic social services, especially education,\ncomplemented by programmes of targeted transfers and safety nets (World\nBank, 1990). A decade later, the WDR on Attacking Poverty preached empow-\nerment of the poor through decentralization in the implementation of social\nservices such as health and education. This would, it was argued, make State\nand social institutions more responsive to the needs of the poor, while build-\ning assets and introducing insurance mechanisms and targeted transfers to\noffer protection against risks and shocks (World Bank, 2001).\nSome middle-income countries such as Chile, Costa Rica, Taiwan and\nSouth Korea, have been comparatively successful in advancing the principle\nof more universal welfare service provision. Most nations in the South, how-\never, are still characterized by limited access to poor quality services and selec-\ntive benefits. This comprises a mixture of residual provision, focusing on\nsocial pathologies, together with incremental service expansion driven by the\npolitical demands of urban middle and organized working classes rather than\nbroader social needs. In Brazil, for example, the social budget strongly subsi-\ndizes wealthier elite and middle-class groups through State funding for higher\neducation and civil service pensions (Hall, 2003, 2006).\nThe welfare ethos of State provision was challenged in the 1980s by the New\nRight, which induced an ideological mistrust of government (Friedman and\nFriedman, 1980; Murray, 1984). The State was now portrayed as paternalist\nand repressive, its direct control to be reduced in favour of greater freedom of\nchoice for individuals. Furthermore, it was seen as necessary to contain public\nspending and shift a larger share of the cost burden onto service consumers. To\nmeet these two goals, economic liberalization and deregulation meant the\ngrowing privatization of public services along with reliance on the creation of\nHall: Social Policies in the World Bank 155\n at London School of Economics & Political Sciences on September 25, 2012gsp.sagepub.comDownloaded from \nmarkets and internal quasi-markets to boost efficiency in the allocation and\nspending of resources. The Bank played a leading role during the 1990s in\npushing forward the \u2018Washington Consensus\u2019 package of privatization and\nstate deregulation of welfare service provision (Williamson, 1990).\nYet market solutions in social provision have proved highly contentious.\nThe charging of user fees in health and education, advocated by the Bank and\nother international organizations during the 1990s, has often been counter-\nproductive and acted as a rationing mechanism that limits access by the poor.\nIn the primary education sector, disquiet over the effects of privatization on\naccess and the subsequent withdrawal of school fees on equity grounds has\nhelped fuel a massive expansion in enrolments in Uganda and Malawi, for\nexample, although improvements in education quality have lagged behind\n(World Bank, 2006a). Due to public resource constraints and fiscal reforms,\nprivate, out-of-pocket payments comprise a major source of revenue for\nhealth financing, 80% in the case of India, for example. However, user fee\npolicies in the health sector are judged to have been a failure generally speak-\ning as they are regressive and discriminate against the poor (Bhatia and\nMossialos, 2004).\nThe privatization of pensions in developing countries, encouraged by the\nBank from the 1980s, demonstrates a similar record. From 1984\u20132004, the\nBank assisted 68 countries with pension reform through over 200 loan oper-\nations. A multi-pillar strategy was promoted based on a combination of pub-\nlicly and, in particular, privately funded mandatory and voluntary plans\n(World Bank, 1994, 2000). Yet in the face of high costs, low returns and lim-\nited coverage, the experiment is now considered by even the Bank itself to\nhave been a failure (Gill et al., 2005). A recent Bank evaluation admitted that\nover-preoccupation with fiscal sustainability had obscured poverty reduction\nand protection goals, and that this approach had not considered policies to\nprotect those vulnerable elderly not covered by public pension schemes\n(World Bank, 2006b).\nOf the three social policy related themes identified in this article, those wel-\nfare inputs provided through the Human Development (HD) network form\nthe most prominent within the Bank\u2019s operations. In fiscal year 2005, it\naccounted for 13% of total Bank lending (US$2.95bn), compared with 8%\n(US$1.19bn) in 2000. Table 1 illustrates the steep rise in HD investments,\nannual spending having increased by 148% in the space of 5 years to 2005.\nBudgetary constraints have led to a slight decrease in annual HD expenditure\nsince the peak year of 2003 (US$3.37bn). Of total \u2018social policy\u2019 spending\nwithin the Bank, HD accounts for 44% (Table 1 and Figure 3). HD is respon-\nsible for 14% of the Bank\u2019s US$95.4bn in net loan commitments, the second\nlargest after Financial and Private Sector Development (Figure 4). In addition\nto its financial significance, the Human Development network commands a\nstrong political position within the Bank. It is home to a large proportion of\nstaff economists and enjoys a reputation for technical strength.\n156 Global Social Policy 7(2)\n at London School of Economics & Political Sciences on September 25, 2012gsp.sagepub.comDownloaded from \nSocial Policy as Protection\nThe second distinctive category of \u2018social policy\u2019 within Bank operations\nincludes measures to protect the weak and vulnerable. This is accomplished\neither through (1) social investments carefully targeted at the poor or (2)\nenvironmental and social safeguard policies designed to mitigate the poten-\ntially harmful impacts of Bank-funded infrastructure projects. The first group\nof social investments falls largely under the Social Protection Unit, set up in\n2001 within the Human Development network (Figure 1). This includes\nlabour market interventions, natural disaster management, social risk mitiga-\ntion, safety nets, vulnerability assessment and monitoring as well as social\ninsurance and pensions.\nHaving emerged in the context of structural adjustment during the 1980s\nand 1990s, safety nets have become an increasingly popular policy instrument\nin the Bank. They now account for almost a quarter of the Bank\u2019s active social\nprotection projects and total commitments of almost US$6bn.2 They include\ncash and conditional income transfers, food programmes, price subsides and\nmicro-credit as well as school vouchers and fee waivers for health care serv-\nices. The Bank claims to have gone beyond mere social protection in its Social\nRisk Management framework, aiming to build livelihood capacity over the\nlonger term. This involves three strategies to deal with risk and vulnerability\n(prevention, mitigation and coping) within a multi-institutional approach\n(World Bank, 2000).\nThe strength of the Social Protection (SP) portfolio within the Bank is\nillustrated by the fact that in 2005 it accounted for 36% of \u2018social policy\u2019\nspending, having more than doubled in size since 2002 (Table 1 and Figure 2).\nHowever, this proportion has dropped slightly since 2000, when SP\naccounted for almost half of the total, and as HD has expanded in relative\nterms over the same period (Figure 3). In 2005, SP was responsible for 7% of\nHall: Social Policies in the World Bank 157\ntable 1 World Bank lending by social policy-related major themes, 2000\u20135 (US$millions)\nTheme 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005\nHuman 1190 1134 1756 3374 3079 2951\ndevelopment\nSocial protection 1895 1651 1086 2324 1577 2437\nSocial 800 1469 1385 1003 1557 1285\ndevelopment\nTotal social policy 3885 4254 4227 6701 6213 6673\nspending\nTotal World 15,276 17,250 19,519 18,513 20,079 22,307\nBank lending\nSource: World Bank (2005e: 57).\n at London School of Economics & Political Sciences on September 25, 2012gsp.sagepub.comDownloaded from \nthe Bank\u2019s active project portfolio of US$95.4bn (Figure 4). In 2005 HD and\nSP together accounted for 21% of Bank lending.\nSocial protection has acquired its prominent place in the Bank\u2019s work pro-\ngramme largely as a result of having to deal with the consequences of eco-\nnomic stabilization and structural adjustment. Far from being self-rectifying\nunder adjustment, as had originally been predicted, poverty and vulnerability\nwere exacerbated in many countries and for many groups. Welfare provision\nwas heavily compromised, with politically \u2018soft\u2019 targets such as health and pri-\nmary education often bearing the brunt of spending cutbacks (Graham-\nBrown, 1991; Kanji and Manji, 1991). In policy making, emphasis was placed\non the creation of safety nets using social funds to target scarce resources at\npoorer, more vulnerable groups (Narayan and Ebbe, 1997; Subbarao, 1997).\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union and comprehensive social security schemes\nin the former communist countries, the East Asia crisis and economic prob-\nlems in Russia and Brazil during 1997\u20138 led to the introduction of large-scale,\ntargeted social protection measures with Bank assistance. Yet, as already\nnoted, attempts to privatize social services and introduce user fees has met\nwith very limited success.\nNowadays, CCT programmes have become increasingly popular with both\nthe Bank and its client governments as a form of social protection. As far as\nthe Bank is concerned, CCTs have several advantages. They allow the poor to\n158 Global Social Policy 7(2)\n0\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\n5000\n6000\n7000\n8000\n2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005\nHuman Development Social Protection\nSocial Development Total social policy\nfigure 2 Trends in World Bank lending for social policy-related themes, 2000\u20135 (US$ millions)\nSource: World Bank (2005e: 57).\n at London School of Economics & Political Sciences on September 25, 2012gsp.sagepub.comDownloaded from \nbe targeted quite effectively and comparatively quickly, with benefits being\ndirectly channelled to vulnerable groups such as women and children, while\ngenerating additional benefits through education and health conditionalities\n(Coady et al., 2004; Rawlings, 2004). Evaluations of Mexico\u2019s Oportunidades\nprogramme (formerly known as PROGRESA), show that education, health\nand nutrition components have had a significant positive impact on welfare\nand human capital (Skoufias, 2005). CCT programmes are also attractive to\nportfolio managers due to the frequently large size of loans involved, since\nprofessional success is judged at least in part by financial turnover. Brazil\u2019s\nBolsa Familia programme, for example, has been allocated total funding of\nUS$2.6bn by the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.\nCCTs are also popular with borrowers, not only because they boost govern-\nment revenues, but also because they enable ruling parties to strengthen their\npolitical support at the ballot box, as illustrated quite clearly in the case of Brazil\nduring the presidential elections of October 2006 (Coady et al., 2004; Hall,\n2006; Pritchett, 2005). In many Latin American countries, CCTs are becoming\na cornerstone of social policy, popular across the ideological spectrum due to\ntheir wide political appeal.3 Bank and borrowers thus have a mutual interest in\nadopting these social protection policies.

Safeguards form one of the main business areas of\ncross-sector support to other departments for Bank anthropologists and sim-\nilar social development specialists. No specific funding figures are available\nfor safeguards policies but their application is strategically vital in project\nimplementation and they enjoy a high profile, being subjected to considerable\nscrutiny from outside the Bank.\nOne unfortunate consequence of introducing such preventive measures is\nthat safeguards-based social policy has, as noted earlier, become equated with\na \u2018do-no-harm\u2019 approach to development. Social experts in this field are often\ninformally likened within Bank circles to an internal police force employed to\nkeep their colleagues under surveillance and minimize any potential damage\nthat projects such as large-scale infrastructure development might cause. The\nperception that social scientists are a thorn in the side of those striving to\nimplement mainstream Bank business in a timely fashion has been difficult to\nshake off and still persists quite strongly within the bureaucracy, as a recent\nevaluation demonstrated (World Bank, 2005b).\nSocial Policy as Social Development\nThe third pillar of social action within the Bank comprises a loosely articulated\nset of activities that falls mainly under the aegis of the Social Development\n(SDV) department, formerly housed within the Environmentally and Socially\nSustainable Development (ESSD) network and, since June 2006, part of the\nSustainable Development Network (SDN). However, the Poverty Reduction\nand Economic Management (PREM) network, which deals with mainstream\nmacro-economic policy, has also acquired partial responsibility for several\n\u2018social\u2019 components that would under normal circumstances be the responsi-\nbility of SDV; for example, empowerment, social capital and gender (Figure 1). \nSocial aspects of Bank operations were first explicitly addressed in the early\n1970s and the first rural sociologists were hired in 1974 with a view to improv-\ning project effectiveness. Early work focused on anthropology and project\noperations (Cochrane and Naronha, 1973), sociological variables in develop-\nment (Cernea, 1985), participant observation (Salmen, 1987), involuntary\nresettlement (Cernea, 1988), indigenous peoples, women and institutions, nat-\nural resource management and social assessment (Perrett and Lethem, 1980).\nThe 1987 Bank reorganization involved setting up Environment Units in each\nof the four regions, which incorporated social scientists as well as environmen-\ntalists. While this reflected growing general concern over the environment\nwithin the Bank, the restructuring was mainly in response to widespread\nadverse publicity received by the Bank within the USA and globally at the\nhands of a vigorous non-governmental organization (NGO) and media cam-\npaign following the catastrophic impacts of major projects, in particular the\nHall: Social Policies in the World Bank 161\n at London School of Economics & Political Sciences on September 25, 2012gsp.sagepub.comDownloaded from \nNorthwest Amazon settlement project (Polonoroeste) in Brazil, among others,\nduring the early 1980s (Redwood, 1993; Rich, 1994; Wade, 1997). The US\nCongress and US Treasury Department also played prominent roles in bring-\ning about these changes.5 In 1993, a Social Policy and Resettlement Division\nwas set up in the then Environmentally Sustainable Development (ESD)\ndepartment with six staff and an anthropologist as division chief. Key Bank fig-\nures such as Michael Cernea, Scott Guggenheim, Gloria Davis and Robert\nGoodland drove forward the introduction of environmental and social safe-\nguard policies while strengthening the use of social analysis in project design\nand appraisal (Davis, 2002).\nA major watershed was reached in 1996 when newly appointed Bank\nPresident James Wolfensohn set up a Social Development Task Force to con-\nsider the role of social assessment in Bank operations. The Strategic Compact\nof 1997 involved management reorganization, decentralization of operations\nto country offices and the introduction of new communications technologies\nand staff training (Mallaby, 2004). A new Environmentally and Socially\nSustainable Development (ESSD) network with its own vice-president was\nset up, including a central Social Development (SDV) department, and\nexpertise also allocated to regional departments. As in 1987, reorganization a\ndecade later was sparked in large measure by conflicts between the Bank and\ncivil society organizations, partly as a consequence of the general \u2018Fifty Years\nis Enough\u2019 campaign and partly as a response to specific complaints at the\nsubordination of environmental and social considerations in lending opera-\ntions on a number of high-profile projects.6 The Bank\u2019s social development\nagenda also received a boost in 1999 from Wolfensohn\u2019s personal commit-\nment to a \u2018Comprehensive Development Framework\u2019. This stressed the\nimportance of local participation, empowerment and an enhanced role for\ncivil society, providing an appropriate context for the adoption of Poverty\nReduction Strategy Papers in debt negotiations (Mallaby, 2004). Multi-mil-\nlion dollar trust funds to support social development projects were established\nby Japanese and European donors that provided additional funds to support\nthe social development portfolio.\nThese changes helped to strengthen the role of \u2018social\u2019 expertise within the\norganization. From just a handful of social scientists employed in the early\n1990s, a decade later the picture had changed considerably. By 2002, some\n200 social development professionals were employed by the Bank either as\nstaff or short-term consultants with another 250 or so Bank staff holding post-\ngraduate degrees in non-economic social sciences (World Bank, 2005b).\nHowever, although this expansion in social expertise mirrors the growth in\nBank lending, social experts are still relatively few in number compared with\nstaff economists, especially in country offices.\nThis steady expansion is highly significant in operational terms, but there is\nstill no single, commonly accepted definition in the Bank of what constitutes\n\u2018social development\u2019. The social development portfolio has grown in a largely\n162 Global Social Policy 7(2)\n at London School of Economics & Political Sciences on September 25, 2012gsp.sagepub.comDownloaded from \nincremental manner, and perhaps this was inevitable given the eclectic nature\nof the subject and the historical context within which it evolved. According to\nthe Bank\u2019s own evaluation, the organization\u2019s social development work \u2018is\noften characterized by what it does, rather than what it is\u2019, and it remains a\n\u2018fuzzy concept\u2019 (World Bank, 2005b: xiv, 2). Surveys have revealed that many\nSDV staff themselves do not consider the group\u2019s goals to be well defined.\nThe SDV work programme falls into several major and evolving \u2018business\nlines\u2019, comprising clusters of projects around social themes that have been\nnurtured since the 1990s. This very mixed group includes community-driven\ndevelopment (CDD), participation and civic engagement, culture, indigenous\npeoples, conflict prevention and reconstruction, youth, and social accounta-\nbility. In addition, as already noted, SDV provides social analysis inputs\nthrough a range of tools applied at project, sector and (more recently) at coun-\ntry levels, delivered largely as cross-sector support to other country and the-\nmatic departments (Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Poverty and Social\nImpact Analysis,7 Country Social Analysis,8 etc.). At the same time, however,\nSDV itself has only a very small free-standing project portfolio of its own\n(World Bank, 2005b). This limited \u2018ownership\u2019 has, according to some inter-\nnal observers, contributed to the political vulnerability of SDV within the\nBank\u2019s hierarchy.\nYet this social \u2018pillar\u2019 has collectively become involved in an increasingly\nlarge proportion of the Bank\u2019s lending portfolio. In the 1980s, investments\nwith some support for social development were responsible for just 5% of\nlending, rising to 15% by 1994 (World Bank, 2005b). From 2000 to 2005,\nSocial Development saw its lending increase by 38%, from US$800m to\nUS$1285m (Table 1). As shown in Figure 3, its share of the current \u2018social pol-\nicy\u2019 agenda in the Bank (21%) remains significantly lower than either Human\nDevelopment (44%) or Social Protection (36%). However, as demonstrated in\nFigure 4, within the Bank\u2019s total active project portfolio, Social Development\nfares relatively well at 9%, compared with HD (14%) and SP (7%).\nYet despite this expansion of budgets and personnel, the \u2018social\u2019 presently\nseems to be in a similar position to that occupied by the \u2018environmental\u2019 in the\nearly 1980s within the Bank. Although social issues are highlighted as critical\nand much progress has been made in carving out a social agenda, the \u2018social\u2019 has\nnot yet entered the mainstream of Bank operations. Social assessment of proj-\nects, for example, unlike environmental assessment, is not mandatory unless\nsafeguard policies such as those for resettlement and indigenous peoples are\ntriggered.9 In all other projects, decisions whether to include social analysis are\ntaken largely at the discretion of team leaders, as had been the case with envi-\nronmental screening before 1987. Decisions whether to adopt non-mandatory\nprocedures are conditioned by factors such as the task manager\u2019s appreciation of\ntheir importance, budgetary and personnel constraints as well as the assessment\nof risk in terms of potential internal repercussions. This is despite the\nnow widely accepted positive association between the incorporation of social\nHall: Social Policies in the World Bank 163\n at London School of Economics & Political Sciences on September 25, 2012gsp.sagepub.comDownloaded from \ndimensions and subsequent project performance (Cernea, 1985; World Bank,\n2005b).\nThere are many reasons for this state of affairs. In addition to the dominance\nof macro-economists within the Bank there is, as already noted, a widespread\nperception that non-economic social scientists (especially anthropologists and\nsociologists) perform essentially policing or remedial roles. They are often still\nseen as something of a hindrance to the institution\u2019s \u2018real\u2019 business of develop-\nment, with objections on social grounds only serving to slow down the process\nof loan approval and disbursement. There is thus a clear tension in Bank oper-\nations between the desire for quantity (i.e. project turnover, the imperative to\nspend allocated funds speedily and present projects for Board approval in a\ntimely fashion) on the one hand and, on the other, the need to improve quality\n(i.e. minimizing negative social impacts and improving project fit). While Bank\nmanagers tend to prioritize project disbursements and financial turnover,\nsocial development specialists have to counterbalance this with the considera-\ntions of quality assurance and safeguards. In the process, however, this often\ncreates a negative internal backlash.\nFurthermore, the Bank\u2019s internal labour market mechanism does not\nencourage technical staff to be outspoken, quite the contrary. Apart from\ndepartmental and sector managers who are wholly or partially paid for through\nguaranteed \u2018core\u2019 funding, technical specialists are obliged to sell their 42 staff\nweeks a year against specific projects (each with its own budget code), whether\noperational or research. Task managers are reluctant to purchase the services\nof those with a reputation for being \u2018awkward\u2019 or \u2018difficult\u2019. This is especially\ntrue once a project has passed the concept phase and is under preparation. A\ntask manager\u2019s kudos is measured via the efficiency with which he or she can\nget projects approved by the Board, not necessarily in terms of project quality.\nObjections on social grounds can increase operational costs and cause delays in\nimplementation. Professional survival in the Bank depends on maintaining\none\u2019s marketability. With no guaranteed funding, a social specialist who can-\nnot pay his or her way enjoys extremely poor job prospects in the Bank. This\nvulnerability has been reinforced by the growing tendency to hire social spe-\ncialists on short-term, temporary contracts, which offer even less stability and\nmake staff even more cautious, inducing much self-censorship.\nThere are other reasons for the sometimes indifferent impact of social\nexperts in the Bank. In spite of the increased numbers of social scientists\namong Bank staff, there are still far too few to do justice to the potential work-\nload. The services of social specialists either from SDV (at the \u2018centre\u2019) or the\ncountry departments (in the \u2018regions\u2019) are in constant demand to provide\ncross-support to projects in all divisions. This skills shortage is especially\nmarked in Bank field offices in country and task teams. Here, there tends to\nbe a strong reliance on short-term consultants to provide necessary social\ninputs but it is debatable whether these have the same clout as internal con-\ntributions that can be followed through by permanent staff.\n164 Global Social Policy 7(2)\n at London School of Economics & Political Sciences on September 25, 2012gsp.sagepub.comDownloaded from \nA major contributory factor that works against social mainstreaming,\nhowever, has its origins in the 1997 organizational restructuring of the Bank,\nmentioned earlier. This introduced a cross-cutting matrix system involving\nthematic and regional networks. Operations staff are generally \u2018mapped\u2019 to\nboth a thematic group (such as HD, PREM or SDV) as well as to a region\n(Latin America, Africa, etc.). This has resulted in the institutional separation\nof social concerns among three vice-presidencies; namely, HD, PREM and\nESSD (now merged into the SDN). With the transfer in 2006 of responsibil-\nity for social safeguards from SDV to yet another vice-presidency for\nOperations Policy and Country Services (OPCS), the social agenda now cuts\nacross four separate Bank networks (Figure 1).\nThe bureaucratic separation of social policy concerns is reinforced by both\nconceptual and operational divisions. Conceptually, social investment is seen\nwithin HD both in terms of supporting macro-economic growth and provid-\ning social protection to the poor and vulnerable. To a large extent, this is also\nthe view within PREM with its overriding concern for macro-economic\ngrowth and poverty alleviation. In principle, the Bank\u2019s social protection poli-\ncies have evolved considerably and now go well beyond the construction of\ntemporary safety nets to incorporate risk prevention and mitigation strategies\nthat strengthen people\u2019s longer-term capacities to ward off poverty and\nexpand their opportunities (World Bank, 2000, 2005c). Yet in practice social\nprotection policies, which account for about a third of the \u2018social\u2019 agenda\nBank budget, are still heavily characterized by measures to safeguard incomes\nand consumption through measures such as conditional cash transfers rather\nthan being instruments for encouraging longer term social investment\n(Britto, 2005; Hall, 2006). SDV, in contrast, tends to view social investments\nas vehicles for advancing not just material but also non-material progress\nmeasured in terms of indicators such as participation and empowerment, cul-\ntural integrity, social integration, social accountability and citizenship rights.\nHowever, the sheer breadth, diversity and somewhat eclectic nature of the\nSDV social agenda makes it difficult to encompass all aspects within a clear,\nsingle definition, despite the attempt to formulate a Social Development\nStrategy (World Bank, 2005a).\nThus, in the eyes of most Bank professionals, welfare and protection com-\nprise the organization\u2019s contribution to what is considered mainstream \u2018social\npolicy\u2019 within the organization. In this view, the \u2018social\u2019 components of devel-\nopment are reduced in the main to deliverable goods and services such as wel-\nfare sector investments or risk-mitigating and targeted interventions. This\ndominant perception is clearly demonstrated for example in the Bank\u2019s\nCountry Assistance Strategy (CAS) documents, which regularly map out\nstrategic priorities and plans for Bank operations in client countries. Here,\nsocial policy is invariably perceived as being synonymous with the provision\nof social services and safety nets, with a growing enthusiasm for conditional\ncash transfer schemes. There is little attempt to systematically harmonize and\nHall: Social Policies in the World Bank 165\n at London School of Economics & Political Sciences on September 25, 2012gsp.sagepub.comDownloaded from \nintegrate wider social development actions alongside and as an integral part\nof the process of macro-economic development (Midgely, 1995). The third\nbranch of \u2018social development\u2019 remains highly fragmented, lacking in concep-\ntual coherence and politically vulnerable within the Bank.\nGiven the organizational separation among networks, matched in some\nmeasure by different intellectual understandings of what constitutes \u2018social\npolicy\u2019 in the Bank, it is inevitable that significant constraints on operational\ncooperation should appear. Competition over access to financial and staff\nresources will flourish (the infamous \u2018turf wars\u2019), especially where there are\nfew if any incentives that encourage cross-departmental collaboration. For\nexample, SDV and PREM have been known to compete vigorously over the\n\u2018ownership\u2019 of social business lines, including the right to lead in the imple-\nmentation of anti-poverty instruments such as Poverty Reduction Strategy\nPapers (PRSPs) and Poverty and Social Impact Analyses (PSIAs), gender\nanalysis and civil society policy. The fact that a department\u2019s kudos is judged\nby the size of its own-managed portfolio rather than by its participation in\ncross-sector collaboration, even when the latter can be measured, leads to\nopen competition over project ownership. Social development specialists\nresent the fact that their cross-sector inputs to projects are often \u2018hidden\u2019 in\nproject budgets \u2018owned\u2019 by another (lead) department and are not given due\nacknowledgement. Such internal progress indicators as portfolio project size\nand financial turnover strongly influence staff promotion prospects, serving\nto reinforce interdepartmental competition further still.\nFUTURE CHALLENGES\nThe social dimensions of development have been addressed by the Bank in a\nvariety of ways and in response to many stimuli, both internal and external to\nthe institution. This diversity is reflected in the range of social policies pur-\nsued and their spread across the organization, leading to a high degree of staff\nfrustration at the lack of cross-sector collaboration and frequent competition,\neven outright conflict, over access to financial and human resources. This\nfragmentation of social agendas has provoked a rethink among social scien-\ntists concerned with reaching a new understanding of what should be\nregarded as \u2018social policy\u2019 in the 21st century. Such preoccupations generated\na major Bank conference in December 2005 to explore \u2018New Frontiers of\nSocial Policy\u2019, which brought together a wide range of development profes-\nsionals and academics. Its concluding statement declared that, \u2018 \u2026 social pol-\nicy should not fall into the trap of one-size-fits-all prescriptions \u2026 [and that\nwe must] \u2026 augment existing social policies by greater attention to employ-\nment (livelihoods), social integration and institutions\u2019 (World Bank, 2005d: 1).\nIndeed, this message rather belatedly reflects long-standing concerns outside\nthe Bank in academia on the limited relevance of the OECD social policy\nmodel for developing countries and of the need for a more holistic view of\nhuman welfare needs.\n166 Global Social Policy 7(2)\n at London School of Economics & Political Sciences on September 25, 2012gsp.sagepub.comDownloaded from \nState welfare programmes in Latin America, for example, have been heavily\ncriticized for reinforcing existing economic and social inequalities and doing\nlittle to promote redistribution or growth (Abel and Lewis, 2002). It is increas-\ningly recognized in policy circles that social provision can be met through a\nvariety of statutory and non-statutory means and via a range of institutions and\nactors at all levels of society from the household and community through to\nlocal, regional, domestic and international arenas. Academic social policy spe-\ncialists have for some time been delivering this message (De Haan, 2000;\nDevereau and Cook, 2000; Hall and Midgley, 2004; Kabeer, 2004; Kennett,\n2004; Institute of Development Studies [IDS], 2006). At the same time, the\nUN has also underscored the need for a wider approach through its research\nprogramme on \u2018Social Policy in a Development Context\u2019 (Mkandawire, 2004).\nThe notion of \u2018welfare regimes\u2019 attempts to capture diverse paradigms through\nwhich needs in developing and transition countries are met by combinations of\nsupport through the State, market and community (Gough and Wood, 2004).\nIn academic and practitioner circles, and more recently within the Bank\nitself, initiatives are thus underway to extend the boundaries of social policy. In\na developing country context, for example, it is argued that social policy should\nbe more clearly linked to promoting economic development. Welfare develop-\nmentalism was strong in Germany, Sweden and Finland, where social insur-\nance and investment schemes were designed to stimulate economic growth.\nThe experiences of South Korea and Taiwan as well as Singapore and Hong\nKong, which successfully developed and applied broad-based social policies,\nshow that such a paradigm is valid and feasible to apply, albeit under special cir-\ncumstances that may not be easily replicable elsewhere (Kwon, 2004).\nOne attempt to link social policy with economic development in the South has\nrevolved around the concept of livelihoods. The Department for International\nDevelopment (DFID)-funded \u2018Social Policy Research Programme\u2019 at the IDS,\nfor example, has adapted the Sustainable Livelihoods approach to focus on\npeople\u2019s livelihood strategies at different levels, analysing the \u2018broader institu-\ntional configuration of social provisioning which prevailed in different contexts\nand \u2026 the extent to which it addressed the needs of the poor\u2019 (Kabeer, 2004: 3).\nIt distinguishes between three \u2018social\u2019 domains; reproduction of life, reproduc-\ntion of labour and reproduction of society. The biological and social reproduc-\ntion of human beings embraces social policy as the provision of care services.\nLabour reproduction involves boosting economic productivity through health\nand education investments. This wider vision implies moving away from seeing\nsocial protection as simply a short-term welfare measure and towards a longer-\nterm security perspective, involving livelihoods strengthening and the adoption\nof a rights-based approach (IDS, 2006). In a similarly broad fashion, Moser\n(2006) has developed an assets-based approach that aims to place social policy in\nthe mainstream of poverty reduction debates.\nThe third dimension outlined in the IDS schema expands the remit of social\npolicy to the macro and global levels. Reproduction of societal relations relate\nHall: Social Policies in the World Bank 167\n at London School of Economics & Political Sciences on September 25, 2012gsp.sagepub.comDownloaded from \nto the ideological and material conditions that form the basis of society,\nembracing \u2018the full range of institutional structures within a society [and\nimplying a] broad understanding of \u201cthe social\u201d as an aspect of development\npolicy\u2019. This approach to social policy \u2018detaches it from its moorings in par-\nticular sectors, programmes and projects and widens it to encompass the pur-\nposive efforts made by a range of public actors in a society, guided by some\nvision of \u201cthe social\u201d, to influence the processes by which life, labour and\nsocial relationships are reproduced within that society\u2019 (Kabeer, 2004: 10\u201311).\nConsonant with this broader vision, the Bank\u2019s concept note for Arusha\ndeclared that: \u2018A more holistic approach to social policy in development con-\ntexts, where markets are grossly imperfect and labor markets often incom-\nplete, would seek to promote policies, institutions and programs that balance\na concern for equity and social justice with the concern for economic growth.\u2019\nSocial policy is defined as, \u2018public policies aimed at three levels: promoting\nequality of opportunity to benefit individuals (micro-level), equality of agency\nand institutional reform to benefit groups (meso-level), and horizontal and\nvertical social integration to benefit society (macro-level)\u2019, which would seek\nto \u2018offset inequities in asset endowment with equitable opportunities for asset\ncreation and livelihoods\u2019 (Dani, 2005: 2\u20133).\nIt remains to be seen whether macro social policy that incorporates and\nbuilds upon broader notions of social development will take hold in the World\nBank. However, in pushing forward this agenda, if indeed it does go forward,\nthe Bank faces a number of challenges; these are conceptual, operational and\npolitical in nature. The first challenge is to overcome the narrow conceptual-\nization of social policy as being limited to welfare services and social protec-\ntion. This would entail close collaboration between the Bank and the\nacademic community to define a framework capable of embracing these par-\nadigms within a wider view that links social policy to livelihoods, well-being\nand economic development more generally. Many staff would resist the inter-\nnalization of such ideas on the grounds that it is not within the Bank\u2019s remit\nand that the institution should limit itself to its conventional project portfolio.\nFurthermore, with the recent emphasis on infrastructure investments in\nofficial declarations under the new presidency, such \u2018soft\u2019 social concerns\nseem even less likely to command either political legitimacy or budgetary\nallocations.\nYet the conceptual challenge, while formidable, is in some respects the least\ndifficult obstacle to overcome. Even if a mutually acceptable definition of social\npolicy is indeed eventually reached, it will amount to little unless it is able to\ninform Bank operations. Welfare service provision and social protection are rel-\natively easy to define and implement within the Bank\u2019s present organizational\nset-up and both enjoy strong internal political support. The institutional sepa-\nration of responsibilities for these areas sets out a fairly clear division of labour\nand delineation of turf boundaries, despite some encroachment. However, this\nalso leads to internecine conflicts and a lack of active collaboration among\n168 Global Social Policy 7(2)\n at London School of Economics & Political Sciences on September 25, 2012gsp.sagepub.comDownloaded from \ndepartments with different social agendas as they compete internally for scarce\nhuman and financial resources in the struggle for kudos and internal authority.\nThe challenge, therefore, would be to find ways of facilitating cross-sector\ncollaboration within an overarching social policy framework. This would nec-\nessarily involve a degree of institutional restructuring together with a re-\nexamination of incentives relating to allocation of funding, to staff promotion\nprospects and employment security, and to other matters that could help to\nfoster a more collaborative work environment. Paradoxically, however, recent\nsurveys show that the majority of Bank staff working with social issues remain\nfirmly opposed to the suggestion that groups should be merged to facilitate\nintegration of social policy agendas. This negative attitude is attributed vari-\nously to \u2018change fatigue\u2019, to a general lack of credibility in Bank capacity to\nget the structure right, and to the popular perception that economists will\nalways predominate in Bank business no matter what organizational changes\nare made (World Bank, 2005b).\nConclusion\nEven if a greater measure of conceptual and operational integration and\ncollaboration were possible in theory among the diverse arms of social policy\nwithin the Bank, there remains a major practical obstacle to social policy\nmainstreaming in the organization. Assuming that a more appropriate social\npolicy framework was defined, its effective implementation through Bank\noperations would be contingent not just upon appropriate changes in organi-\nzational and incentive structures, although these alone would require a radi-\ncal rethink. Progress would, even more critically, be contingent on there\nbeing clear political backing for strengthening and integrating the Bank\u2019s\nsocial agenda more systematically into mainstream operations.\nHowever, the Bank reorganization announced in June 2006 does not augur\nwell for such change. To recap, the ESSD vice-presidency was abolished and\nthe network merged with Infastructure (INF) to form a new SDN. At the\nsame time, the environmental and social safeguards teams (in ENV and SDV)\nwere transferred from the former ESSD to a separate vice-presidency, OPCS.\nThe then bank president Paul Wolfowitz declared that, \u2018The purpose of con-\nsolidating these two networks is to mainstream environmental issues, improve\nsynergies, better integrate core operations, and ensure that we strengthen our\nfocus on sustainability as we increase our investment in infrastructure\u2019 (World\nBank, 2006c: 1).\nThe brief but pointed reference to infrastructure in this statement is signif-\nicant. It reflects a feeling among some Bank staff that the institution should\nreturn to its \u2018core\u2019 values of promoting economic modernization above all\nelse. Many argue that such a new emphasis would more accurately reflect\nclient country demands for heavy investment as a precursor for growth. It is\nHall: Social Policies in the World Bank 169\n at London School of Economics & Political Sciences on September 25, 2012gsp.sagepub.comDownloaded from \nalso the product of disillusionment in some quarters with the record of \u2018softer\u2019\nsocial investments in supporting the development process. Indeed, this dis-\ncourse is reminiscent of that heard during the early 1980s when MacNamara\u2019s\npoverty agenda was eclipsed under Clausen by the return to a focus on\neconomic growth.\nIt is a moot point whether this most recent reorganization and emphasis\non infrastructure has been influenced by US foreign policy objectives, with\na possible desire to redirect Bank investments into eventual post-war recon-\nstruction efforts (in Iraq or Afghanistan, for example). The infamous debacle\ninvolving Bank chief economist Joe Stiglitz, and Ravi Kanbur, director of the\nWDR 2000, who both resigned in protest at alleged external \u2018interference\u2019\nby the US Treasury, suggests that such a geo-political link is not outside the\nrealms of possibility.10 Indeed, as noted earlier, it is well known that pressure\nfrom the US Treasury was a major factor in persuading the Bank to introduce\nreforms in its environmental procedures and organizational structure from\n1987.\nYet, while the full implications of these organizational changes will take\ntime to fully reveal themselves, outside observers have expressed serious con-\ncerns that they might weaken environmental and social considerations,\nincluding safeguards, and subsume them to the interests of infrastructure\ninvestments (Bretton Woods, 2006). Under such circumstances, it is difficult\nto imagine how a social policy agenda could grow within the organization, at\nleast for the foreseeable future. Indeed, it seems even less likely now than it\ndid a few years ago that preconditions exist for the expansion and consolida-\ntion of social development and social policy within the World Bank.\nacknowledgements\nThanks are due to Professor James Midgley and to three anonymous reviewers for\ntheir valuable comments on an earlier version of this article.

During the 1980s under adjustment, welfare spending was doubly rewarding.\n\u2018Killing two birds with one stone, social service projects were discovered to be a\npowerful tool for the occasion: they served the adjustment, and thus the produc-\ntivity and growth objective; and they served the equity and poverty objectives.\u2019\n(Kapur et al., 1997: Vol. 1, 349).\n2.

The 10 safeguard policies now include environmental assessment, natural habi-\ntats, pest management, involuntary resettlement, indigenous peoples, forests,\nsafety of dams, cultural property, projects in international waterways and projects\nin disputed areas.\n170 Global Social Policy 7(2)\n at London School of Economics & Political Sciences on September 25, 2012gsp.sagepub.comDownloaded from \n5. Approved in 1981, Polonoroeste demonstrated such a catalogue of errors and\ngenerated such protest that in 1985 the mid-term review recommended suspen-\nsion of loan disbursements. These criticisms were made in the context of a much\nwider, global wave of concern during the late 1980s over issues of environmental\nmanagement and sustainable development. Advocacy NGOs in the USA were\ninstrumental in placing evidence of the Bank\u2019s poor record on environmental and\nindigenous affairs before key congressional committees in 1983, culminating in a\nlist of recommendations calling upon the Bank and counterpart organizations to\nstrengthen their environmental (including social) procedures. In addition, there\nwas strong criticism from the powerful Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on\nForeign Operations. Most crucially, however, the US Treasury under James Baker\ninsisted that the Bank should \u2018clean up its act\u2019 as a precondition for approval of an\nInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) capital increase\nand IDA replenishment (Wade, 1997).\n6. These included the Sardar Sarovar dam project in India, the Chonoy dam in\nGuatemala and the Bulyanhulu gold mine in Tanzania. Another case in point was\nthe Itaparica hydropower scheme in Northeast Brazil, which was reformulated to\nallow for comprehensive resettlement provision following massive local and\ninternational protests (Hall, 1994; Wade, 1997).\n7. Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) analyses the distributional impact of\npolicy reforms on the well-being or welfare of different stakeholder groups, with\nparticular focus on the poor and vulnerable. It plays a growing role in the elabo-\nration and implementation of poverty reduction strategies in developing coun-\ntries. The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) is designed to outline\npoverty reduction goals as a condition of debt relief provided under the enhanced\nHighly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative.\n8. The Country Social Analysis (CSA) takes a broader view of the social, economic\nand political context of development within specific countries in order to inform\ncountry operations and provide guidance on investment priorities.\n9. Environmental review and clearance procedures became mandatory for all Bank\nprojects in 1987, and a portfolio of \u2018environmental\u2019 projects was established.\n10. Chief economist Joe Stiglitz and Ravi Kanbur, director of the World Development\nReport 2000, resigned (in 1999 and 2000 respectively) in protest at alleged interven-\ntion by the US Treasury to influence the content of the WDR as well as other Bank\npolicy statements concerning the relative weight of civil society\/anti-poverty vs eco-\nnomic development\/free market messages and priorities (Wade, 2001, 2002).\nreferences\nAbel, C. and Lewis, C.

Les services de l\u2019assistance sociale et les besoins fondamentaux,\nainsi que la protection sociale en tant que filets et garanties sociales, forment l\u2019ensemble\nde ce qui est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement consid\u00e9r\u00e9 dans l\u2019organisation comme \u00e9tant la composante de\nla politique sociale. Le d\u00e9veloppement social refl\u00e8te une vue plus large et plus fragmen-\nt\u00e9e de la politique sociale. R\u00e9cemment, les sp\u00e9cialistes bancaires ont tent\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9largir la\nd\u00e9finition de la politique sociale au-del\u00e0 du bien-\u00eatre et de la protection, en se basant sur\nun discours acad\u00e9mique de longue date dans ce dossier.
