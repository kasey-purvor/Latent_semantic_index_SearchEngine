Here we are concerned with their effect on the prediction of the anomalous magnetic\nmoment of the muon, a\u00b5 \u2261 (g\u00b5\u22122)\/2, and on the running of the QED coupling to the Z boson\nmass. We explain below why it is crucial to predict these two quantities as precisely as possible\nin order to test the Standard Model and to probe New Physics.\nFirst, we recall that the anomalous magnetic moments of the electron and muon are two\nof the most accurately measured quantities in particle physics. Indeed the anomalous moment\nof the electron has been measured to a few parts per billion and is found to be completely\ndescribed by quantum electrodynamics. This is the most precisely tested agreement between\nexperiment and quantum field theory. On the other hand, since the muon is some 200 times\nheavier than the electron, its moment is sensitive to small-distance strong and weak interaction\neffects, and therefore depends on all aspects of the Standard Model. The world average of the\nexisting measurements of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon is\naexp\u00b5 = 11659203(8)\u00d7 10\u221210, (1)\nwhich is dominated by the recent value obtained by the Muon g\u22122 collaboration at Brookhaven\nNational Laboratory [1]. Again, the extremely accurate measurement offers a stringent test of\ntheory, but this time of the whole Standard Model. If a statistically significant deviation,\nno matter how tiny, can be definitively established between the measured value aexp\u00b5 and the\nStandard Model prediction, then it will herald the existence of new physics beyond the Standard\nModel. In particular the comparison offers valuable constraints on possible contributions from\nSUSY particles.\nThe other quantity, the QED coupling at the Z boson mass, MZ , is equally important.\nIt is the least well known of the three parameters (the Fermi constant G\u00b5, MZ and \u03b1(M\n2\nZ)),\nwhich are usually taken to define the electroweak part of the Standard Model. Its uncertainty\nis therefore one of the major limiting factors for precision electroweak physics. It limits, for\nexample, the accuracy of the indirect estimate of the Higgs mass in the Standard Model.\n3\nThe hadronic contributions to g\u22122 of the muon and to the running of \u03b1(s) can be calculated\nfrom perturbative QCD (pQCD) only for energies well above the heavy flavour thresholds1. To\ncalculate the important non-perturbative contributions from the low energy hadronic vacuum\npolarization insertions in the photon propagator we use the measured total cross section2\n\u03c30had(s) \u2261 \u03c30tot(e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u2217 \u2192 hadrons), (2)\nwhere the 0 superscript is to indicate that we take the bare cross section with no initial state\nradiative or vacuum polarization corrections, but with final state radiative corrections. Alter-\nnatively we may use\nR(s) =\n\u03c30had(s)\n\u03c3pt(s)\n, (3)\nwhere \u03c3pt \u2261 4\u03c0\u03b12\/3s with \u03b1 = \u03b1(0). Analyticity and the optical theorem then yield the\ndispersion relations\nahad,LO\u00b5 =\n(\n\u03b1m\u00b5\n3\u03c0\n)2 \u222b \u221e\nsth\nds\nR(s)K(s)\ns2\n, (4)\n\u2206\u03b1had(s) = \u2212\u03b1s\n3\u03c0\nP\n\u222b \u221e\nsth\nds\u2032\nR(s\u2032)\ns\u2032(s\u2032 \u2212 s) , (5)\nfor the hadronic contributions to a\u00b5 \u2261 (g\u00b5 \u2212 2)\/2 and \u2206\u03b1(s) = 1 \u2212 \u03b1\/\u03b1(s), respectively. The\nsuperscript LO on a\u00b5 denotes the leading-order hadronic contribution. There are also sizeable\nnext-to-leading order (NLO) vacuum polarization and so-called \u201clight-by-light\u201d hadronic con-\ntributions to a\u00b5, which we will introduce later. The kernel K(s) in (4) is a known function (see\n(45)), which increases monotonically from 0.40 at m2pi0 (the \u03c0\n0\u03b3 threshold) to 0.63 at s = 4m2pi\n(the \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 threshold), and then to 1 as s \u2192 \u221e. As compared to (5) evaluated at s = M2Z ,\nwe see that the integral in (4) is much more dominated by contributions from the low energy\ndomain.\nAt present, the accuracy to which these hadronic corrections can be calculated is the limiting\nfactor in the precision to which g\u2212 2 of the muon and \u03b1(M2Z) can be calculated. The hadronic\ncorrections in turn rely on the accuracy to which R(s) can be determined from the experimental\ndata, particularly in the low energy domain. For a precision analysis, the reliance on the\nexperimental values of R(s) or \u03c30had(s) poses several problems:\n\u2022 First, we must study how the data have been corrected for radiative effects. For example,\nto express R(s) in (4) and (5) in terms of the observed hadron production cross section,\n\u03c3had(s), we have\nR(s) \u2261 \u03c3\n0\nhad(s)\n4\u03c0\u03b12\/3s\n\u2243\n(\n\u03b1\n\u03b1(s)\n)2\n\u03c3had(s)\n4\u03c0\u03b12\/3s\n, (6)\nif the data have not been corrected for vacuum polarization effects. The radiative correc-\ntion factors, such as (\u03b1\/\u03b1(s))2 in (6), depend on each experiment, and we discuss them\nin detail in Section 2.\n1In some previous analyses pQCD has been used in certain regions between the flavour thresholds. With\nthe recent data, we find that the pQCD and data driven numbers are in agreement and not much more can be\ngained by using pQCD in a wider range.\n2Strictly speaking we are dealing with a fully inclusive cross section which includes final state radiation,\ne+e\u2212 \u2192 hadrons(+\u03b3).\n4\n\u2022 Second, below about \u221as \u223c 1.5 GeV, inclusive measurements of \u03c30had(s) are not available,\nand instead a sum of the measurements of exclusive processes (e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212, \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212\u03c00,\nK+K\u2212, . . .) is used.\n\u2022 To obtain the most reliable \u2018experimental\u2019 values for R(s) or \u03c30had(s) we have to combine\ncarefully, in a consistent way, data from a variety of experiments of differing precision and\ncovering different energy intervals. In Section 2 we show how this is accomplished using\na clustering method which minimizes a non-linear \u03c72 function.\n\u2022 In the region 1.5 <\u223c\n\u221a\ns <\u223c 2 GeV where both inclusive and exclusive experimental deter-\nminations of \u03c30had(s) have been made, there appears to be some difference in the values.\nIn Section 4 we introduce QCD sum rules explicitly designed to resolve this discrepancy.\n\u2022 Finally, we have to decide whether to use the indirect information on e+e\u2212 \u2192 hadrons ob-\ntained for\n\u221a\ns < m\u03c4 , via the Conserved-Vector-Current (CVC) hypothesis, from precision\ndata for the hadronic decays of \u03c4 leptons. However, recent experiments at Novosibirsk\nhave significantly improved the accuracy of the measurements of the e+e\u2212 \u2192 hadronic\nchannels, and reveal a sizeable discrepancy with the CVC prediction from the \u03c4 data;\nsee the careful study of [2]. Even with the re-analysed CMD-2 data the discrepancy\nstill remains [3]. This suggests that the understanding of the CVC hypothesis may be\ninadequate at the desired level of precision. It is also possible that the discrepancy is com-\ning from the e+e\u2212 or \u03c4 spectral function data itself, e.g. from some not yet understood\nsystematic effect.3\nThe experimental discrepancy may be clarified by measurements of the radiative return4\nevents, that is e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212\u03b3, at DA\u03a6NE [6] and BaBar [8]. Indeed the preliminary\nmeasurements of the pion form factor by the KLOE Collaboration [9] compare well with\nthe recent precise CMD-2 \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 data [10, 11] in the energy region above 0.7 GeV, and\nare significantly below the values obtained, via CVC, from \u03c4 decays [2]. We therefore do\nnot include the \u03c4 data in our analysis.\nWe have previously published [12] a short summary of our evaluation of (4), which gave\nahad,LO\u00b5 = (683.1\u00b1 5.9exp \u00b1 2.0rad)\u00d7 10\u221210. (7)\nWhen this was combined with the other contributions to g \u2212 2 we found that\naSM\u00b5 \u2261 (g \u2212 2)\/2 = (11659166.9\u00b1 7.4)\u00d7 10\u221210, (8)\nin the Standard Model, which is about three standard deviations below the measured value\ngiven in (1). The purpose of this paper is threefold. First, to describe our method of analysis in\ndetail, and to make a careful comparison with the contemporary evaluation of Ref. [3]. Second,\n3The energy dependence of the discrepancy between e+e\u2212 and \u03c4 data is displayed in Fig. 2 of [3]. One\npossible origin would be an unexpectedly large mass difference between charged and neutral \u03c1 mesons, see, for\nexample, [4].\n4See [5] for a theoretical discussion of the application of \u201cradiative return\u201d to measure the cross sections for\ne+e\u2212 \u2192 pipi,KK\u00af, . . . at \u03c6 and B factories [6, 7].\n5\nthe recent CMD-2 data for the e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212, \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212\u03c00 and K0SK0L channels [11, 13, 14] has just\nbeen re-analysed, and the measured values re-adjusted [10]. We therefore recompute ahad,LO\u00b5 to\nsee how the values given in (7) and (8) are changed. Third, we use our knowledge of the data\nfor R(s) to give an updated determination of \u2206\u03b1had(s), and hence of the QED coupling \u03b1(M\n2\nZ).\nThe outline of the paper is as follows. As mentioned above, Section 2 describes how to\nprocess and combine the data, from a wide variety of different experiments, so as to give the\noptimum form of R(s), defined in (3). In Section 3 we describe how we evaluate dispersion\nrelations (4) and (5), for ahad,LO\u00b5 and \u2206\u03b1had respectively, and, in particular, give Tables and plots\nto show which energy intervals give the dominant contributions and dominant uncertainties.\nSection 4 shows how QCD sum rules may be used to resolve discrepancies between the inclusive\nand exclusive measurements of R(s). Section 5 contains a comparison with other predictions of\ng\u22122, and in particular a contribution-by-contribution comparison with the very recent DEHZ 03\ndetermination [3]. In Section 6 we calculate the internal5 hadronic light-by-light contributions\nto a\u00b5. Section 7 describes an updated calculation of the NLO hadronic contribution, a\nhad,NLO\n\u00b5 .\nIn this Section we give our prediction for g \u2212 2 of the muon. Section 8 is devoted to the\ncomputation of the value of the QED coupling at the Z boson mass, \u03b1(M2Z); comparison is\nmade with earlier determinations. We also give the implications of the updated value for\nthe estimate of the Standard Model Higgs boson mass. Finally in Section 9 we present our\nconclusions.\n2 Processing the data for e+e\u2212 \u2192hadrons\nThe data that are used in this analysis for R(s), in order to evaluate dispersion relations\n(4) and (5), are summarized in Table 1, for both the individual exclusive channels (e+e\u2212 \u2192\n\u03c0+\u03c0\u2212, \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212\u03c00, K+K\u2212, . . .) and the inclusive process (e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u2217 \u2192 hadrons)6. In Sections 2.1\u2013\n2.3 we discuss the radiative corrections to the individual data sets, and then in Section 2.4 we\naddress the problem of combining different data sets for a given channel.\nIncidentally, we need to assume that initial state radiative corrections (which are described\nby pure QED) have been properly accounted for in all experiments. We note that the interfer-\nence between initial and final state radiation cancels out in the total cross section.\n2.1 Vacuum polarization corrections\nThe observed cross sections in e+e\u2212 annihilation contain effects from the s-channel photon\nvacuum polarization (VP) corrections. Their net effect can be expressed by replacing the QED\ncoupling constant by the running effective coupling as follows:\n\u03b12 \u2192 \u03b1(s)2. (9)\nOn the other hand, the hadronic cross section which enters the dispersion integral representa-\ntions of the vacuum polarization contribution in (4) and (5) should be the bare cross section.\n5In this notation, the familiar light-by-light contributions are called external; see Section 6.\n6A complete compilation of these data can be found in [15].\n6\nWe therefore need to multiply the experimental data by the factor\nCvp = C\nA\nvp =\n(\n\u03b1\n\u03b1(s)\n)2\n, (10)\nif no VP corrections have been applied to the data and if the luminosity is measured correctly by\ntaking into account all the VP corrections to the processes used for the luminosity measurement.\nThese two conditions are met only for some recent data.\nIn some early experiments (DM2, NA7), the muon-pair production process is used as the\nnormalization cross section, \u03c3norm. For these measurements, all the corrections to the photon\npropagator cancel out exactly, and the correction factor is unity:\nCvp = C\nB\nvp = 1. (11)\nHowever, most experiments use Bhabha scattering as the normalization (or luminosity-defining)\nprocess. If no VP correction has been applied to this normalization cross section, the correction\nis dominated by the contribution to the t channel photon exchange amplitudes at tmin, since\nthe Bhabha scattering cross section behaves as d\u03c3\/dt \u221d \u03b12\/t2 at small |t|. Thus we may\napproximate the correction factor for the Bhabha scattering cross section by\n\u03b12 \u2192 (\u03b1(tmin))2. (12)\nIn this case, the cross section should be multiplied by the factor\nCvp = C\nC\nvp =\n(\u03b1\/\u03b1(s))2\n(\u03b1\/\u03b1(tmin))2\n=\n(\n\u03b1(tmin)\n\u03b1(s)\n)2\n, (13)\nwhere\ntmin = \u2212s(1\u2212 cos \u03b8cut)\/2. (14)\nIf, for example, | cos \u03b8cut| \u2243 1, then \u03b1(tmin) \u2243 \u03b1, and the correction factor (13) would be nearer\nto (10). On the other hand, if | cos \u03b8cut| <\u223c 0.5, then \u03b1(tmin) \u223c \u03b1(s), and the correction (13)\nwould be near to (11).\nIn most of the old data, the leptonic (electron and muon) contribution to the photon vacuum\npolarization function has been accounted for in the analysis. [This does not affect data which\nuse \u03c3(\u00b5+\u00b5\u2212) as the normalization cross section, since the correction cancels out, and so (11)\nstill applies.] However, for those experiments which use Bhabha scattering to normalize the\ndata, the correction factor (13) should be modified to\nCvp = C\nD\nvp =\n(\u03b1l(s)\/\u03b1(s))\n2\n(\u03b1l(tmin)\/\u03b1(tmin))2\n, (15)\nwhere \u03b1l(s) is the running QED coupling with only the electron and muon contributions to the\nphoton vacuum polarization function included. In the case of the older inclusive R data, only\nthe electron contribution has been taken into account, and we take only l = e in (15):\nCvp = C\nE\nvp =\n(\u03b1e(s)\/\u03b1(s))\n2\n(\u03b1e(tmin)\/\u03b1(tmin))2\n. (16)\n7\nWe summarize the information we use for the vacuum polarization corrections in Table 2\nwhere we partly use information given in Table III of [99] and in addition give corrections for\nfurther data sets and recent experiments not covered there. It is important to note that the\nmost recent data from CMD-2 for \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212, \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212\u03c00 and K0SK\n0\nL, as re-analysed in [10], and the\nK0SK\n0\nL data above the \u03c6 [49], are already presented as undressed cross sections, and hence are\nnot further corrected by us. The same applies to the inclusive R measurements from BES,\nCLEO, LENA and Crystal Ball. In the last column of Table 2 we present the ranges of vacuum\npolarization correction factors Cvp, if we approximate \u2013 as done in many analyses \u2013 the required\ntime-like \u03b1(s) by the smooth space-like \u03b1(\u2212s). The numbers result from applying formulae (10),\n(11), (15), (16) as specified in the second to last column, over the energy ranges relevant for the\nrespective data sets7. The correction factors obtained in this way are very close to, but below,\n\u221as  (GeV)\nC v\npD\nwith \u03b1(s) for \u03c3had\nwith \u03b1(-s) for \u03c3had\nsolid and dashed:  cos(\u03b8\ncut) = 0.5\ndotted: cos(\u03b8\ncut) = 0.8\n0.9\n0.925\n0.95\n0.975\n1\n1.025\n1.05\n1.075\n1.1\n0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3\nFigure 1: Vacuum polarization correction factor CDvp in the low energy regime. The continuous\nline is the full result as applied in our analysis, whereas the dashed line is obtained when using\n\u03b1(\u2212s) as an approximation for \u03b1(s). Both curves are for cos \u03b8cut = 0.5 whereas the dotted lines\nare obtained for cos \u03b8cut = 0.8.\n7To obtain these numbers we have used the parametrization of Burkhardt and Pietrzyk [100] for \u03b1(q2) in\nthe space-like region, q2 < 0.\n8\none, decrease with increasing energy, and are very similar to the corrections factors as given in\nTable III of [99]. However, for our actual analysis we make use of a recent parametrization of\n\u03b1, which is also available in the time-like regime [101]. For the low energies around the \u03c9 and\n\u03c6 resonances relevant here, the running of \u03b1 exhibits a striking energy dependence, and so do\nour correction factors Cvp. We therefore do not include them in Table 2 but display the energy\ndependent factor CDvp in Fig. 1. For comparison, the correction using space-like \u03b1, \u03b1(\u2212s), is\ndisplayed as dashed and dotted lines for cos \u03b8cut = 0.5 and 0.8 respectively.\nFor all exclusive data sets not mentioned in Table 2 no corrections are applied. In most\nof these cases the possible effect is very small compared to the large systematic errors or even\nincluded already in the error estimates of the experiments. For all inclusive data sets not cited\nin Table 2 (but used in our analysis as indicated in Table 1) we assume, in line with earlier\nanalyses, that only electronic VP corrections have been applied to the quoted hadronic cross\nsection values. We therefore do correct for missing leptonic (\u00b5, \u03c4) and hadronic contributions,\nusing a variant of (10) without the electronic corrections:\nCvp = C\nF\nvp =\n(\u03b1\/\u03b1(s))2\n(\u03b1\/\u03b1e(s))2\n=\n(\n\u03b1e(s)\n\u03b1(s)\n)2\n. (17)\nThis may, as is clear from the discussion above, lead to an overcorrection due to a possible\ncancellation between corrections to the luminosity defining and hadronic cross sections, in\nwhich case either CBvp (if \u03c3norm = \u03c3\u00b5\u00b5) or C\nE\nvp (if \u03c3norm = \u03c3ee) should be used. However, those\ncorrections turn out to be small compared to the error in the corresponding energy regimes. In\naddition, we conservatively include these uncertainties in the estimate of an extra error \u03b4avp\u00b5 ,\nas discussed below.\nThe application of the strongly energy dependent VP corrections leads to shifts \u2206avp\u00b5 of\nthe contributions to a\u00b5 as displayed in Table 3. Note that these VP corrections are significant\nand of the order of the experimental error in these channels. In view of this, the large positive\nshift for the leading \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 channel \u2014 expected from the correction factor as displayed in Fig. 1\n\u2014 is still comparably small. This is due to the dominant role of the CMD-2 data which do\nnot require correction, as discussed above. Similarly, for the inclusive data (above 2 GeV), the\nresulting VP corrections would be larger without the important recent data from BES which\nare more accurate than earlier measurements and have been corrected appropriately already.\nTo estimate the uncertainties in the treatment of VP corrections, we take half of the shifts\nfor all channels summed in quadrature8. The total error due to VP is then given by\n\u03b4avp,excl+incl\u00b5 =\n1\n2\n(\nall channels i\u2211 (\n\u2206avp,i\u00b5\n)2)1\/2\n= 1.20\u00d7 10\u221210 . (18)\nAlternatively, we may assume these systematic uncertainties are highly correlated and prefer\nto add the shifts linearly. For a\u00b5 this results in a much smaller error due to cancellations of\n8For data sets with no correction applied, the shifts \u2206avp\u00b5 are obviously zero. To be consistent and conser-\nvative for these sets (CLEO, LENA and Crystal Ball) we assign vacuum polarization corrections, but just for\nthe error estimate. This results in a total shift of the inclusive data of \u2206avp,incl.\u00b5 = \u22120.94\u00d7 10\u221210, rather than\nthe \u2212(0.54 + 0.07)\u00d7 10\u221210 implied by Table 3.\n9\nthe VP corrections, and we prefer to take the more conservative result (18) as our estimate of\nthe additional uncertainty. However, for \u2206\u03b1had, no significant cancellations are found to take\nplace between channels, so adding the shifts linearly gives the bigger effect. Hence for \u2206\u03b1had\nwe estimate the error from VP as\n\u03b4\u2206\u03b1vp,excl+inclhad =\n1\n2\nall channels i\u2211\n\u2206(\u2206\u03b1had)\nvp,i = 1.07\u00d7 10\u22124 . (19)\n2.2 Final state radiative corrections\nFor all the e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 data (except CMD-2 [11], whose values for \u03c30pipi(\u03b3) already contain\nfinal state photons) and e+e\u2212 \u2192 K+K\u2212 data, we correct for the final state radiation effects by\nusing the theoretical formula\nCfsr = 1 + \u03b7(s)\u03b1\/\u03c0 , (20)\nwhere \u03b7(s) is given e.g. in [102]9. In the expression for \u03b7(s), we take m = mpi for \u03c0\n+\u03c0\u2212,\nand m = mK for K\n+K\u2212 production. Although the formula assumes point-like charged scalar\nbosons, the effects of \u03c0 and K structure are expected to be small at energies not too far\naway from the threshold, where the cross section is significant. The above factor corrects the\nexperimental data for the photon radiation effects, including both real emissions and virtual\nphoton effects. Because there is not sufficient information available as to how the various sets\nof experimental data are corrected for final state photon radiative effects, we include 50% of\nthe correction factor with a 50% error. That is, we take\nCfsr =\n(\n1 + 0.5 \u03b7(s)\n\u03b1\n\u03c0\n)\n\u00b1 0.5 \u03b7(s) \u03b1\n\u03c0\n, (21)\nso that the entire range, from omitting to including the correction, is spanned. The esti-\nmated additional uncertainties from final state photon radiation in these two channels are\nthen numerically \u03b4afsr,pi\n+pi\u2212\n\u00b5 = 0.68 \u00d7 10\u221210 and \u03b4afsr,K+K\u2212\u00b5 = 0.42 \u00d7 10\u221210, and for \u2206\u03b1had,\n\u03b4\u2206\u03b1fsr,pi\n+pi\u2212\nhad = 0.04 \u00d7 10\u22124 and \u03b4\u2206\u03b1fsr,K\n+K\u2212\nhad = 0.06 \u00d7 10\u22124. For all other exclusive modes we\ndo not apply final state radiative corrections, but assign an additional 1% error to the contri-\nbutions of these channels in our estimate of the uncertainty from radiative corrections. This\nmeans that we effectively take\nCfsr = 1\u00b1 0.01 (22)\nfor the other exclusive modes such as 3\u03c0, \u03c00\u03b3, \u03b7\u03b3, 4\u03c0, 5\u03c0,KK\u00afn\u03c0, etc., which gives\n\u03b4afsr, other\u00b5 = 0.81\u00d7 10\u221210, (23)\n\u03b4\u2206\u03b1fsr, otherhad = 0.10\u00d7 10\u22124. (24)\n9For the pi+pi\u2212 contribution very close to threshold, which is computed in chiral perturbation theory, we\napply the exponentiated correction formula (47) of [102]. For a detailed discussion of FSR related uncertainties\nin pi+pi\u2212 production see also [103].\n10\n2.3 Radiative corrections for the narrow (J\/\u03c8, \u03c8\u2032,\u03a5) resonances\nThe narrow resonance contributions to the dispersion integral are proportional to the leptonic\nwidths \u0393(V \u2192 e+e\u2212). The leptonic widths tabulated in [104] contain photon vacuum polariza-\ntion corrections, as well as final state photon emission corrections. We remove those corrections\nto obtain the bare leptonic width\n\u03930ee = Cres\u0393(V \u2192 e+e\u2212) (25)\nwhere\nCres =\n(\u03b1\/\u03b1(m2V ))\n2\n1 + (3\/4)\u03b1\/\u03c0\n. (26)\nSince a reliable evaluation of \u03b1(m2V ) for the very narrow J\/\u03c8, \u03c8\n\u2032 and \u03a5 resonances is not\navailable, we use \u03b1(\u2212m2V ) in the place of \u03b1(m2V ) in (26). The correction factors obtained in\nthis way are small, namely Cres = 0.95 for J\/\u03c8 and \u03c8\n\u2032, and 0.93 for \u03a5 resonances, in agreement\nwith the estimate given in [105]. A more precise evaluation of the correction factor (26) will be\ndiscussed elsewhere [106].\nTo estimate the uncertainty in the treatment of VP corrections, we take half of the errors\nsummed linearly over all the narrow resonances. In this way we found\n\u03b4avp,res\u00b5 =\n1\n2\n\u2211\nV=J\/\u03c8,\u03c8\u2032,\u03a5\n\u03b4avp,V\u00b5\n= (0.15 + 0.04 + 0.00)\u00d7 10\u221210 (27)\n= 0.19\u00d7 10\u221210, (28)\n\u03b4\u2206\u03b1vp,reshad =\n1\n2\n\u2211\nV=J\/\u03c8,\u03c8\u2032,\u03a5\n\u03b4\u2206\u03b1vp,Vhad\n= (0.17 + 0.06 + 0.02 + 0.00)\u00d7 10\u22124 (29)\n= 0.25\u00d7 10\u22124, (30)\nwhere the three numbers in (27) mean the contributions from J\/\u03c8, \u03c8\u2032 and \u03a5(1S \u2212 6S), re-\nspectively. Similarly, the four numbers in (29) are the contributions from J\/\u03c8, \u03c8\u2032,\u03a5(1S) and\n\u03a5(2S \u2212 6S).\n2.4 Combining data sets\nTo evaluate dispersion integrals (4) and (5) and their uncertainties, we need to input the\nfunction R(s) and its error. It is clearly desirable to make as few theoretical assumptions as\npossible on the shape and the normalization of R(s). Two typical such assumptions are the use\nof Breit\u2013Wigner shapes for resonance contributions and the use of perturbative QCD predictions\nin certain domains of s. If we adopt these theoretical parameterizations of R(s), then it becomes\ndifficult to estimate the error of the integral. Therefore, we do not make any assumptions on the\nshape of R(s), and use the trapezoidal rule for performing the integral up to\n\u221a\ns = 11.09 GeV,\nbeyond which we use the most recent perturbative QCD estimates, including the complete quark\n11\nmass corrections up to order \u03b12S, see e.g. [107]. This approach has been made possible because\nof the recent, much more precise, data on 2\u03c0, 3\u03c0,KK\u00af, \u03c00\u03b3, \u03b7\u03b3 channels in the \u03c9 and \u03c6 resonant\nregions10. Although this procedure is free from theoretical prejudice, we still have to address\nthe problem of combining data from different experiments (for the same hadronic channel),\neach with their individual uncertainties. If we would perform the dispersion integrals (4), (5)\nfor each data set from each experiment separately and then average the resulting contributions\nto a\u00b5 (or \u2206\u03b1had), this, in general, would lead to a loss of information resulting in unrealistic\nerror estimates (as discussed e.g. in [108]), and is, in addition, impracticable in the case of data\nsets with very few points. On the other hand, a strict point-to-point integration over all data\npoints from different experiments in a given channel would clearly lead to an overestimate of the\nuncertainty because the weighting of precise data would be heavily suppressed by nearby data\npoints of lower quality. The asymmetry of fluctuations in poorly measured multi-particle final\nstates and in energy regions close to the thresholds could in addition lead to an overestimate\nof the mean values of a\u00b5 and \u2206\u03b1had.\nFor these reasons, data should be combined before the integration is performed. As different\nexperiments give data points in different energy bins, obviously some kind of \u2018re-binning\u2019 has\nto be applied11. The bin-size of the combined data will depend, of course, on the available\ndata and has to be much smaller in resonance as compared to continuum regimes (see below).\nFor the determination of the mean R value, within a bin, the R measurements from different\nexperiments should contribute according to their weight.\nThe problem that the weight of accurate, but sparse, data may become lower than inaccu-\nrate, but densely-populated, data is well illustrated by the toy example shown in Fig. 2. The\nplots show two hypothetical sets of R data. The set shown by circles has many data points\nwith large statistical and a 30% systematic error. The second set has only two data points,\nshown by squares, but has small statistical and only a 1% systematic error. (The length of the\nerror bars of each point is given by the statistical and systematic error added in quadrature,\nwhereas the little horizontal line inside the bar indicates the size of the statistical error alone.)\nTwo alternative ways of treating the data are shown in Fig. 2, together with the respective\ncontribution to a\u00b5, which follows from the trapezoidal integration. In the first plot, the impact\nof the two accurate data points is local (with a 5 MeV cluster size no combination with the the\nother set takes place and only two of the less accurate points around 1.7 GeV are combined),\nand we see that the integral has a 30% error. In the second plot, we have assumed that R(s)\ndoes not change much in a 50 MeV interval, and hence have combined data points which lie in\n50 MeV \u2018clusters\u2019. In this clustering process, the overall normalization factors of the two data\nsets are allowed to vary within their uncertainties. In the toy example, this means that in the\nupper plot no renormalization adjustment takes place, as there is no cluster with points from\nboth data sets. In the lower plot, however, the points of the more accurate set 2 are binned\ntogether in the clusters with mean energies 1.51 and 1.83 GeV and lead to a renormalization of\n10The J\/\u03c8, \u03c8\u2032 and the \u03a5 resonances are still treated in the zero-width approximation.\n11Another possibility to \u2018combine\u2019 data, is to fit them simultaneously to a function with enough free param-\neters, typically polynomials and Breit\u2013Wigner shapes for continuum and resonance contributions, see e.g. [99].\nWe decided to avoid any such prejudices about the shape of R and possible problems of separating continuum\nand resonance contributions.\n12\nall the points of the less accurate set by a factor 1\/1.35. (Vice versa the adjustment of set 2 is\nmarginal, only (1\/0.9995), due to its small errors.) It is through this renormalization procedure\nthat the sparse, but very accurate, data can affect the integral. As a result, in the example\nshown, the value of the integral is reduced by about 30% and the error is reduced from 30%\nto 15%. The goodness of the fit can be judged by the \u03c72min per degree of freedom, which is\n0.61 in this toy example. We find that by increasing the cluster size, that is by strengthening\nour theoretical assumption about the piecewise constant nature of R, the error of the integral\ndecreases (and the \u03c72min per degree of freedom rises). Note that the \u2018pull down\u2019 of the mean\nR values observed in our toy example is not an artefact of the statistical treatment (see the\nremark below) but a property of the data.\nMore precisely, to combine all data points for the same channel which fall in suitably chosen\n(narrow) energy bins, we determine the mean R values and their errors for all clusters by\nminimising the non-linear \u03c72 function\n\u03c72(Rm, fk) =\nNexp\u2211\nk=1\n[(1\u2212 fk) \/dfk]2 +\nNclust\u2211\nm=1\nN{k,m}\u2211\ni=1\n[(\nR\n{k,m}\ni \u2212 fkRm\n)\n\/dR\n{k,m}\ni\n]2\n. (31)\nHere Rm and fk are the fit parameters for the mean R value of the m\nth cluster and the overall\nnormalization factor of the kth experiment, respectively. R\n{k,m}\ni and dR\n{k,m}\ni are the R values\nand errors from experiment k contributing to clusterm. For dR\n{k,m}\ni the statistical and, if given,\npoint-to-point systematic errors are added in quadrature, whereas dfk is the overall systematic\nerror of the kth experiment. Minimization of (31) with respect to the (Nexp+Nclust) parameters,\nfk and Rm, gives our best estimates for these parameters together with their error correlations.\nIn order to parameterize R(s) in terms of Rm, we need a prescription to determine the\nlocation of the cluster,\n\u221a\ns = Em. We proceed as follows. When the original data points, which\ncontribute to the cluster m, give\nR(\n\u221a\ns = E\n{k,m}\ni ) = R\n{k,m}\ni \u00b1\n\u221a(\ndR\n{k,m}\ni\n)2\n+ (dfk)\n2 (32)\nfrom the kth experiment, we calculate the cluster energy Em by\nEm =\n\uf8ee\uf8ef\uf8f0\u2211\nk\nN{k,m}\u2211\ni=1\n1(\ndR\n{k,m}\ni\n)2\n+ (dfk)\n2\nE\n{k,m}\ni\n\uf8f9\uf8fa\uf8fb\/\n\uf8ee\uf8ef\uf8f0\u2211\nk\nN{k,m}\u2211\ni=1\n1(\ndR\n{k,m}\ni\n)2\n+ (dfk)\n2\n\uf8f9\uf8fa\uf8fb , (33)\nwhere the sum over k is for those experiments whose data points contribute to the cluster m.\nHere we use the point-to-point errors, dR\n{k,m}\ni , added in quadrature with the systematic error,\ndfk, to weight the contribution of each data point to the cluster energy Em. Alternatively, we\ncould use just the statistical errors to determine the cluster energies Em. We have checked that\nthe results are only affected very slightly by this change for our chosen values for the cluster\nsizes.\nThe minimization of the non-linear \u03c72 function with respect to the free parameters Rm and\nfk is performed numerically in an iterative procedure\n12 and we obtain the following parameter-\nization of R(s):\nR(s = E2m) \u2261 Rm = Rm \u00b1 dRm, (34)\n12Our non-linear definition (31) of the \u03c72 function avoids the pitfalls of simpler definitions without rescaling\nof the errors which would allow for a linearized solution of the minimization problem, see e.g. [109, 110].\n13\n\u2206 = 5 MeV, 16 clusters\n\u03c72 \nmin\/d.o.f. = 0.02\na\u00b5 = (0.90 \u00b1 0.27) \u22c5 10 -10\n\u221as (GeV)\n\u03c3\n \n(nb\n)\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n3.5\n1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9\n\u2206 = 50 MeV, 9 clusters\n\u03c72 \nmin\/d.o.f. = 0.61\na\u00b5 = (0.65 \u00b1 0.10) \u22c5 10 -10\n\u221as (GeV)\n\u03c3\n \n(nb\n)\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n3.5\n1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9\nFigure 2: Two toy data sets chosen to illustrate the problems of combining precise with less\nprecise data. The upper plot shows the result obtained with a very small \u2018cluster\u2019 size. The\nlower shows the data clustered in 50 MeV bins, which allows renormalization of the data within\ntheir systematic errors. Here the (much less precise) points of set 1 are renormalized by 1\/1.35\nwhereas the two precise points of set two are nearly unchanged (1\/0.9995). The length of the\nerror bars give the statistical plus systematic errors added in quadrature for each data point.\nThe small horizontal lines in the bars indicate the size of the statistical errors. The error band\nof the clustered data is defined through the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix.\n14\nwhere the correlation between the errors dRm and dRn,\n\u03c1corr(m,n) = V (m,n)\/(dRm)(dRn), (35)\nwith V (m,m) = (dRm)\n2, is obtained from the covariance matrix V (m,n) of the fit, that is\n\u03c72 = \u03c72min +\nNclust\u2211\nm=1\nNclust\u2211\nn=1\n(Rm \u2212Rm)V \u22121(m,n)(Rn \u2212 Rn). (36)\nHere the normalization uncertainties are integrated out. We keep the fitted values of the\nnormalization factors fk\nfk = f\u00afk. (37)\nThe \u03c72 function takes its minimum value \u03c72min when Rm = Rm and fk = f\u00afk. The goodness of\nthe fit can be judged from\n\u03c72min\nd.o.f.\n=\n\u03c72min\u2211\nk(Nk \u2212 1)\u2212Ncluster\n, (38)\nwhere\n\u2211\nkNk stands for the total number of data points and\n\u2211\nk(\u22121) stands for the overall\nnormalization uncertainty per experiment. Once a good fit to the function R(s) is obtained,\nwe may estimate any integral and its error as follows. Consider the definite integral\nI(a, b) =\n\u222b b2\na2\ndsR(s)K(s) = 2\n\u222b b\na\ndE ER(E2)K(E2) = I\u00af \u00b1\u2206I. (39)\nWhen a = Em < En = b, the integral I is estimated by the trapezoidal rule to be\nI\u00af = 2\n\uf8eb\uf8edEm+1 \u2212Em\n2\nEmRmKm +\nEn \u2212En\u22121\n2\nEnRnKn +\nn\u22121\u2211\nk=m+1\nEk+1 \u2212 Ek\u22121\n2\nEkRkKk\n\uf8f6\uf8f8 , (40)\nwhere Kk = K(E\n2\nk), and its error \u2206I is determined, via the covariance matrix V , to be\n(\u2206I)2 =\nn\u2211\nk=m\nn\u2211\nl=m\n\u2202I\u00af\n\u2202Rk\nV (k, l)\n\u2202I\u00af\n\u2202Rl\n(41)\n=\nn\u2211\nk,l=m\n((Ek+1 \u2212 Ek\u22121)Ek Kk )V (k, l) ((El+1 \u2212El\u22121)ElKl) , (42)\nwhere Em\u22121 = Em and En+1 = En at the edges, according to (40). When the integration\nboundaries do not match a cluster energy, we use the trapezoidal rule to interpolate between\nthe adjacent clusters.\nWe have checked that for all hadronic channels we find a stable value and error for ahad,LO\u00b5 ,\ntogether with a good13 \u03c72 fit if we vary the minimal cluster size around our chosen default\nvalues (which are typically about 0.2 MeV for a narrow resonance and about 10 MeV or larger\nfor the continuum). For the most important \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 channel we show in Fig. 3 the behaviour of\n13However, there are three channels for which \u03c72min\/d.o.f. > 1.2, indicating that the data sets are mu-\ntually incompatible. These are the e+e\u2212 \u2192 pi+pi\u2212pi+pi\u2212, pi+pi\u2212pi0, pi+pi\u2212pi0pi0 channels with \u03c72min\/d.o.f. =\n2.00, 1.44, 1.28 respectively. For these cases the error is enlarged by a factor of\n\u221a\n\u03c72min\/d.o.f.. Note that for\nthe four pion channel a re-analysis from CMD-2 is under way which is expected to bring CMD-2 and SND data\nin much better agreement [111]. If we were to use the same procedure, but now enlarging the errors of the data\nsets with \u03c72min\/d.o.f. > 1, then we find that the experimental error on our determination of a\nhad,LO\n\u00b5 is increased\nby less than 3% from the values given in (125) and (126) below.\n15\n495\n497.5\n500\n502.5\n505\n507.5\n510\n512.5\n515\n517.5\n0 2 4 6 8 10\n\u03b4  (MeV)\na \u00b5\n \npi\n+\npi\n-\n \n \n(10\n-\n10\n)\n\u03b4  (MeV)\n\u03c72 \nm\nin\n\/d\n.o\n.f.\n,  \n \u2206\na \u00b5\n \npi\n+\npi\n-\n \n \n(%\n)\n1\n1.25\n1.5\n1.75\n2\n2.25\n2.5\n2.75\n3\n0 2 4 6 8 10\nFigure 3: Dependence of the fit on the cluster size parameter \u03b4 in the case of the \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 channel:\nthe band in the upper plot shows the contribution to a\u00b5 and its errors for different choices of\nthe cluster size. The three lines show a\u00af\u00b5 (solid), a\u00af\u00b5+\u2206a\u00b5 and a\u00af\u00b5\u2212\u2206a\u00b5 (dotted), respectively.\nThe lower plot displays the \u03c72min\/d.o.f.

It is clear that very large values of \u03b4, even if they lead to\na satisfactory \u03c72min, should be discarded as the fit would impose too much theoretical prejudice\non the shape of R(s). Thus, in practice, we also have to check how the curve of the clustered\ndata, and its errors, describe the data. One would, in general, try to avoid combining together\ntoo many data points in a single cluster.\nIn Table 4 we give the details of the clustering and non-linear fit for the most relevant\nchannels. The fits take into account data as cited in Table 1 with energy ranges as indicated\nin the second column of Table 4. We use clustering sizes \u03b4 as displayed in the third column.\nIn the \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212\u03c00, K+K\u2212 and K0SK\n0\nL channels the binning has to be very fine in the \u03c9 and \u03c6\nresonance regimes; the respective values of the clustering sizes in the continuum, (\u03c9 and) \u03c6\nregions are given in the Table. The \u03c72min\/d.o.f. displayed in the fourth column is always good,\napart from the three channels \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212\u03c0+\u03c0\u2212, \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212\u03c00 and \u03c0+\u03c0\u22122\u03c00, in which we inflate the error\nas mentioned above. In most cases the fit quality and result is amazingly stable with respect to\nthe choice of the cluster size, indicating that no information is lost through the clustering. Table\n4 also gives information about the contribution of the leading channels to a\u00b5 within the given\nranges. For comparison, the last column shows the contributions to a\u00b5 obtained by combining\ndata without allowing for renormalization of individual data sets through the fit parameters fk.\nIn this case, we use the same binning as in the full clustering, but calculate the mean values\nRm just as the weighted average of the R data within a cluster:\nRm \u2261 R\u02dcm =\n\uf8ee\uf8ef\uf8f0\u2211\nk\nN{k,m}\u2211\ni=1\n1(\ndR\n{k,m}\ni\n)2\n+ (dfk)\n2\nR\n{k,m}\ni\n\uf8f9\uf8fa\uf8fb\/\n\uf8ee\uf8ef\uf8f0\u2211\nk\nN{k,m}\u2211\ni=1\n1(\ndR\n{k,m}\ni\n)2\n+ (dfk)\n2\n\uf8f9\uf8fa\uf8fb . (43)\n(These R\u02dcm values are actually used as starting values for our iterative fit procedure.) The point-\nto-point trapezoidal integration (40) with these R\u02dcm values from (43) without the fit neglects\ncorrelations between different energies. As is clear from the comparison of columns six and\neight of Table 4, such a procedure leads to wrong results, especially in the most important\n\u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 channel.\nAs explained above, the dispersion integrals (4) and (5) are evaluated by integrating (us-\ning the trapezoidal rule (40) for the mean value and (42) for the error and thus including\ncorrelations) over the clustered data directly for all hadronic channels, including the \u03c9 and \u03c6\nresonances. Thus we avoid possible problems due to missing or double-counting of non-resonant\nbackgrounds. Moreover interference effects are taken into account automatically. As an exam-\nple we display in Fig. 7 the most important \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 channel, together with an enlargement of\nthe region of \u03c1\u2013\u03c9 interference. As in Fig. 2, the error band is given by the diagonal elements\nof the covariance matrix of our fit, indicating the uncertainty of the mean values. Data points\nare displayed (here and in the following) after application of radiative corrections. The error\nbars show the statistical and systematic errors added in quadrature and the horizontal markers\ninside the error bars indicate the size of the statistical error alone.\nIn the region between 1.43 and \u223c 2 GeV we have the choice between summing up the exclu-\nsive channels or relying on the inclusive measurements from the \u03b3\u03b32, MEA, M3N and ADONE\nexperiments [84]\u2013[87]. Two-body final states were not included in these analyses.

Note the suppressed zero of the\nvertical scale.\ncorrect the R data from \u03b3\u03b32, MEA and ADONE for missing contributions from \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212, K+K\u2212\nand K0SK\n0\nL, estimating them from our exclusive data compilation.\n14 The corrections are small\ncompared to the large statistical and systematic errors and energy dependent, ranging from\nup to 7% at 1.4 GeV down to about 3% at 2 GeV. In addition, we add some purely neutral\nmodes to the inclusive data, see below. Surprisingly, even after having applied these correc-\ntions, the sum of exclusive channels overshoots the inclusive data. The discrepancy is shown\nin Fig. 4, where we display the results of our clustering algorithm for the inclusive and the\nsum of exclusive data including error bars defined by the diagonal elements of the covariance\nmatrices (errors added in quadrature for the exclusive channels). We study the problem of this\nexclusive\/inclusive discrepancy in detail in Section 4.\n3 Evaluation of the dispersion relations for ahad,LO\u00b5 and\n\u2206\u03b1had\nHere we use dispersion relations (4) and (5) to determine ahad,LO\u00b5 and \u2206\u03b1had(M\n2\nZ) respectively\n15,\nwhich in turn we will use to predict g \u2212 2 of the muon (in Section 7) and the QED coupling\n14We do not correct the data from M3N as they quote an extra error of 15% for the missing channels which\nis taken into account in the analysis.\n15It is conventional to compute \u2206\u03b1had for 5 quark flavours, and to denote it by \u2206\u03b1\n(5)\nhad. For simplicity of\npresentation we often omit the superscript (5), but make the notation explicit when we add the contribution of\nthe top quark in Section 8.\n18\n\u03b1(M2Z) (in Section 8). The dispersion relation (4) has the form\nahad,LO\u00b5 =\n1\n4\u03c03\n\u222b \u221e\nsth\nds \u03c30had(s)\n(\nm2\u00b5\n3s\nK(s)\n)\n, (44)\nwhere \u03c30had(s) is the total cross section for e\n+e\u2212 \u2192 hadrons (+\u03b3) at centre-of-mass energy \u221as,\nas defined in (2). For s > 4m2\u00b5 the kernel function K(s) is given by [112]\nK(s > 4m2\u00b5) =\n3s\nm2\u00b5\n{\nx2\n2\n(2\u2212 x2) + (1 + x\n2)(1 + x)2\nx2\n(\nln(1 + x)\u2212 x+ x\n2\n2\n)\n+\n1 + x\n1\u2212 xx\n2 ln x\n}\n,(45)\nwith x \u2261 (1\u2212 \u03b2\u00b5)\/(1 + \u03b2\u00b5) where \u03b2\u00b5 \u2261\n\u221a\n1\u2212 4m2\u00b5\/s; while for s < 4m2\u00b5 the form of the kernel\ncan be found in [113], and is used to evaluate the small \u03c00\u03b3 contribution to ahad,LO\u00b5 . Dispersion\nrelation (5), evaluated at s =M2Z , may be written in the form\n\u2206\u03b1had(M\n2\nZ) = \u2212\nM2Z\n4\u03c02\u03b1\nP\n\u222b \u221e\nsth\nds\n\u03c30had(s)\ns\u2212M2Z\n. (46)\nTo evaluate (44) and (46) we need to input the function \u03c30had(s) and its error. Up to\n\u221a\ns \u223c\n2 GeV we can calculate \u03c30had from the sum of the cross sections for all the exclusive channels\ne+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212, \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212\u03c00, etc. On the other hand for \u221as >\u223c 1.4 GeV the value of \u03c30had can be\nobtained from inclusive measurements of e+e\u2212 \u2192 hadrons. Thus, as mentioned above, there is\nan \u2018exclusive, inclusive overlap\u2019 in the interval 1.4 <\u223c\n\u221a\ns <\u223c 2 GeV, which allows a comparison of\nthe two methods of determining \u03c30had from the data. As we have seen, the two determinations\ndo not agree, see Fig. 4. It is worth noting that the data in this interval come from older\nexperiments. The new, higher precision, Novosibirsk data on the exclusive channels terminate\nat\n\u221a\ns \u223c 1.4 GeV, and the recent inclusive BES data [88, 89] start only at \u221as \u223c 2 GeV. Thus\nin Table 5 we show the contributions of the individual channels to ahad,LO\u00b5 and \u2206\u03b1had(M\n2\nZ) using\nfirst inclusive data in the interval 1.43 <\n\u221a\ns < 2 GeV, and then replacing them by the sum of\nthe exclusive channels.\nBelow we describe, in turn, how the contributions of each channel have been evaluated.\nFirst we note that narrow \u03c9 and \u03c6 contributions to the appropriate channels are obtained by\nintegrating over the (clustered) data using the trapezoidal rule. We investigated the use of\nparametric Breit\u2013Wigner forms by fitting to the data over various mass ranges. We found no\nsignificant change in the contributions if the resonant parameterization was used in the region\nof the \u03c9 and \u03c6 peaks, but that the contributions of the resonance tails depend a little on the\nparametric form used. The problem did not originate from a bias due to the use of the linear\ntrapezoidal rule in a region where the resonant form was concave, but rather was due to the\nfact that different resonant forms fitted better to different points in the tails. For this reason\nwe believe that it is more reliable to rely entirely on the data, which are now quite precise in\nthe resonance regions.\n3.1 \u03c00\u03b3 channel\nThe contribution of the e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c00\u03b3 channel defines the lower limit, \u221asth = mpi, of the\ndispersion integrals. There exist two data sets [31, 32] for this channel, which cover the interval\n19\n0.60 <\n\u221a\ns < 1.03 GeV (see Fig. 5). After clustering, a trapezoidal rule integration over this\n\u03c00\u03b3 energy interval gives a contribution\na\u00b5(\u03c0\n0\u03b3, 0.6 <\n\u221a\ns < 1.03 GeV) = (4.50\u00b1 0.15)\u00d7 10\u221210 (47)\nand\n\u2206\u03b1had(\u03c0\n0\u03b3, 0.6 <\n\u221a\ns < 1.03 GeV) = (0.36\u00b1 0.01)\u00d7 10\u22124. (48)\nIn Fig. 5 we show an overall picture of the e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c00\u03b3 data and a blow up around the \u03c1-\u03c9\nregion.\nThe use of the trapezoidal rule for the interval mpi <\n\u221a\ns < 0.6 GeV would overestimate\nthe contribution, since the cross section is not linear in\n\u221a\ns. In this region we use chiral\nperturbation theory (ChPT), based on the Wess\u2013Zumino\u2013Witten (WZW) local interaction for\nthe \u03c00\u03b3\u03b3 vertex,\nLWZW = \u2212 \u03b1\n8\u03c0fpi\n\u03c00\u01eb\u00b5\u03bd\u03bb\u03c3F\u00b5\u03bdF\u03bb\u03c3, (49)\nwith fpi \u2243 93 MeV, which yields\n\u03c3(e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c00\u03b3) = \u03c3pt \u2261 8\u03b1\u03c0\u0393(\u03c0\n0 \u2192 2\u03b3)\n3m3pi\n(\n1\u2212 m\n2\npi\ns\n)3\n. (50)\nSince the electromagnetic current couples to \u03c00\u03b3 via \u03c9 meson exchange, the low-energy cross\nsection can be improved by assuming the \u03c9-meson dominance [113], which gives\n\u03c3VMD(e\n+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c00\u03b3) = \u03c3pt(e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c00\u03b3)\n(\nm2\u03c9\nm2\u03c9 \u2212 s\n)2\n. (51)\nWe find\na\u00b5(\u03c0\n0\u03b3,\n\u221a\ns < 0.6 GeV) = (0.13\u00b1 0.01)\u00d7 10\u221210, (52)\nwhile the contribution to \u2206\u03b1had is less than 10\n\u22126. The agreement of the prediction of (51) for\nthe \u03c00\u03b3 cross section with the SND data just above 0.6 GeV is shown in Fig. 6.\n3.2 \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 channel\nWe use 16 data sets for e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 [10], [16]\u2013[30] which cover the energy range 0.32 < \u221as <\n3.0 GeV. Some older data with very large errors are omitted.

The second plot is an enlargement of the \u03c1-\u03c9 interference region.\n23\nover the data up to 1.43 GeV, we obtain\na\u00b5(\u03c0\n+\u03c0\u2212, 0.32 <\n\u221a\ns < 1.43 GeV) = (502.78\u00b1 5.02)\u00d7 10\u221210, (53)\n\u2206\u03b1had(\u03c0\n+\u03c0\u2212, 0.32 <\n\u221a\ns < 1.43 GeV) = (34.39\u00b1 0.29)\u00d7 10\u22124. (54)\nIf we integrate up to 2 GeV, instead of 1.43 GeV, we obtain\na\u00b5(\u03c0\n+\u03c0\u2212, 0.32 <\n\u221a\ns < 2 GeV) = (503.38\u00b1 5.02)\u00d7 10\u221210, (55)\n\u2206\u03b1had(\u03c0\n+\u03c0\u2212, 0.32 <\n\u221a\ns < 2 GeV) = (34.59\u00b1 0.29)\u00d7 10\u22124. (56)\nThe contribution of the \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 channel is dominated by the \u03c1-meson, and hence the differences\nbetween Eqs. (53) and (55) is small. If we use the CMD-2 data before the recent re-analysis [10],\nwe have\na\u00b5(\u03c0\n+\u03c0\u2212, 0.32 <\n\u221a\ns < 1.43 GeV, old CMD-2 data) = (492.66\u00b1 4.93)\u00d7 10\u221210, (57)\n\u2206\u03b1had(\u03c0\n+\u03c0\u2212, 0.32 <\n\u221a\ns < 1.43 GeV, old CMD-2 data) = (33.65\u00b1 0.28)\u00d7 10\u22124. (58)\nThe comparison of (53) and (57) shows the effect of the re-analysis of the recent CMD-2 data,\nwhich is an upward shift of the central value by roughly 2% in this interval.\nIt is interesting to quantify the prominent role of these most precise CMD-2 e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212\ndata, which have a systematic error of only 0.6%. If we were to omit these CMD-2 data in the\ncentral \u03c1 regime altogether, the contribution of this channel to a\u00b5 would decrease by roughly\n12.1 \u00d7 10\u221210, i.e., by \u223c 2.4%, whereas the error would increase by about 3.4 \u00d7 10\u221210, i.e., by\n\u223c 68% in the interval 0.32 < \u221as < 1.43 GeV.\nIn the threshold region, below 0.32 GeV, we use chiral perturbation theory, due to the lack\nof \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 experimental data. The pion form factor Fpi(s) is written as\nFpi(s) = 1 +\n1\n6\n\u3008r2\u3009pis + cpis2 +O(s3), (59)\nwith coefficients determined to be [114]\n\u3008r2\u3009pi = 0.431\u00b1 0.026 (fm2), cpi = 3.2\u00b1 1.0 (GeV\u22124), (60)\nby fitting to space-like pion scattering data [115]. Fig. 8 compares the prediction with the\n(time-like) experimental data which exist for\n\u221a\ns \u2265 0.32 GeV. The contributions from the\nthreshold region are\na\u00b5(\u03c0\n+\u03c0\u2212,\n\u221a\ns < 0.32 GeV) = (2.36\u00b1 0.05)\u00d7 10\u221210, (61)\n\u2206\u03b1had(\u03c0\n+\u03c0\u2212,\n\u221a\ns < 0.32 GeV) = (0.04\u00b1 0.00)\u00d7 10\u22124, (62)\nand are also listed in the last row of Table 6. Though these contributions are small, for a\u00b5 it is\nnon-negligible.\nIn the calculation of the contribution from the threshold region, we have included the effect\nfrom final state (FS) radiative corrections.

In the figure we have multiplied\nm2\u00b5\/(3s)K(s) by the cross section so that the area below the data is proportional to the con-\ntribution to a\u00b5. The theoretical curve obtained from chiral perturbation theory is also shown,\nand is used up to\n\u221a\ns = 0.32 GeV (s = 0.10 GeV2).\nexponentiated formula for the FS corrections are given. If we do not apply the FS correction,\nwe would obtain\na\u00b5(\u03c0\n+\u03c0\u2212,\n\u221a\ns < 0.32 GeV) = (2.30\u00b1 0.05)\u00d7 10\u221210. (63)\nHowever, if we include the FS corrections, we have\na\u00b5(\u03c0\n+\u03c0\u2212,\n\u221a\ns < 0.32 GeV,O(\u03b1) FS corr.) = (2.36\u00b1 0.05)\u00d7 10\u221210. (64)\nWe obtain the same contribution if we use the exponentiated formula, which we have used in\nall the tables in the paper. The effect of final state radiation is to increase the contribution by\nabout 3 %, whether the O(\u03b1) or the exponentiated form is used. Similarly, the contribution\nfrom this region to \u2206\u03b1had(M\n2\nZ) is given by\n\u2206\u03b1had(\u03c0\n+\u03c0\u2212,\n\u221a\ns < 0.32 GeV, exponentiated FS corr.) = (0.04\u00b1 0.00)\u00d7 10\u22124, (65)\nso here the contribution from the threshold region is totally negligible.\n3.3 \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212\u03c00 channel\nWe use ten experimental data sets for the \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212\u03c00 channel [10, 13, 22, 34], [37]\u2013[42], which\nextend up to 2.4 GeV, although the earlier experiments have large errors, see Fig. 9. Since\n25\nthe data for this channel are not very good, we inflate the error by a factor of\n\u221a\n\u03c72min\/d.o.f.,\nwhich is 1.20 for this channel. (We inflate the error by a factor of\n\u221a\n\u03c72min\/d.o.f. whenever\n\u03c72min\/d.o.f. > 1.2, as discussed in Section 2.4, see Table 4.) We discard the data points below\n0.66 GeV, in favour of the predictions of chiral perturbation theory [116, 117], see Fig. 10. The\ncontributions to ahad,LO\u00b5 and \u2206\u03b1had(M\n2\nZ) are\na\u00b5(\u03c0\n+\u03c0\u2212\u03c00, 0.66 GeV <\n\u221a\ns < 1.43 GeV, data) = (46.43\u00b1 0.90)\u00d7 10\u221210, (66)\n\u2206\u03b1had(\u03c0\n+\u03c0\u2212\u03c00, 0.66 GeV <\n\u221a\ns < 1.43 GeV, data) = (4.33\u00b1 0.08)\u00d7 10\u22124, (67)\nrespectively.\nIn the threshold region, below 0.66 GeV, we use chiral perturbation theory [116, 117], due\nto the lack of good \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212\u03c00 experimental data, see Figs. 9 and 10. The contributions to ahad,LO\u00b5\nand \u2206\u03b1had(M\n2\nZ) from the threshold region are\na\u00b5(\u03c0\n+\u03c0\u2212\u03c00,\n\u221a\ns < 0.66 GeV, ChPT) = (0.01\u00b1 0.00)\u00d7 10\u221210, (68)\n\u2206\u03b1had(\u03c0\n+\u03c0\u2212\u03c00,\n\u221a\ns < 0.66 GeV, ChPT) = (0.00\u00b1 0.00)\u00d7 10\u22124. (69)\nThere is a tendency that the ChPT prediction with the \u03c9-dominance undershoots the lowest-\nenergy data points. Because of the smallness of the threshold contribution, we do not attempt\nfurther improvement of the analysis.\n3.4 \u03b7\u03b3 channel\nWe use five data sets from SND [32, 33] and CMD-2 [34, 35, 36]. We divide the data set given\nin Ref. [36] into two parts at 0.95 GeV since it has different systematic errors below and above\nthis energy.\nSince the lowest data point starts only at 690 MeV, we use ChPT at the threshold region up\nto the lowest-energy data point. We summarize our method in Appendix A, according to which\nthe contribution from the region to ahad,LO\u00b5 is less than 10\n\u221212, which can be safely neglected.\nThe contribution to \u2206\u03b1had is also small, and less than 10\n\u22127. In Fig. 11 we show the threshold\nregion of the \u03b7\u03b3 production cross section and our prediction from ChPT.\nAbove the lowest-energy data point we integrate over the data. In Fig. 12 we show the overall\npicture of the \u03b7\u03b3 production cross section and our result of the clustering. After integrating\nover 0.69 <\n\u221a\ns < 1.43 GeV we obtain\na\u00b5(\u03b7\u03b3, 0.69 <\n\u221a\ns < 1.43 GeV) = (0.73\u00b1 0.03)\u00d7 10\u221210, (70)\n\u2206\u03b1had(\u03b7\u03b3, 0.69 <\n\u221a\ns < 1.43 GeV) = (0.09\u00b1 0.00)\u00d7 10\u22124.

We use five data\nsets for the 2\u03c0+2\u03c0\u2212\u03c00 channel [22, 50, 56, 57, 62], and one data set for the \u03c0+\u03c0\u22123\u03c00 channel [50].\nWe integrate over the clustered data, which gives\na\u00b5(2\u03c0\n+2\u03c0\u2212\u03c00,\n\u221a\ns < 1.43 GeV, data) = (0.26\u00b1 0.04)\u00d7 10\u221210, (76)\n\u2206\u03b1had(2\u03c0\n+2\u03c0\u2212\u03c00,\n\u221a\ns < 1.43 GeV, data) = (0.06\u00b1 0.01)\u00d7 10\u22124, (77)\nand\na\u00b5(\u03c0\n+\u03c0\u22123\u03c00,\n\u221a\ns < 1.43 GeV, data) = (0.09\u00b1 0.09)\u00d7 10\u221210, (78)\n\u2206\u03b1had(\u03c0\n+\u03c0\u22123\u03c00,\n\u221a\ns < 1.43 GeV, data) = (0.02\u00b1 0.02)\u00d7 10\u22124, (79)\n30\nrespectively. For the 5\u03c0 channels we do not inflate the error since the \u03c72min\/d.o.f. values are\n\u03c72min\/d.o.f.(2\u03c0\n+2\u03c0\u2212\u03c00) = 0.90, (80)\n\u03c72min\/d.o.f.(\u03c0\n+\u03c0\u22123\u03c00) = 1.07. (81)\nFor the 6\u03c0 channel, there are data for the 3\u03c0+3\u03c0\u2212 and the 2\u03c0+2\u03c0\u22122\u03c00 final states, but not\nfor the \u03c0+\u03c0\u22124\u03c00 final state. For the \u03c0+\u03c0\u22124\u03c00 channel we estimate the contribution to a\u00b5 and\n\u2206\u03b1had by using an isospin relation. The reaction e\n+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u2217 \u2192 6\u03c00 is forbidden from charge\nconjugation.\nWe use four data sets for the 3\u03c0+3\u03c0\u2212 channel [50, 62, 71, 72]. M3N [50] provides the lowest\ndata point which is at 1.35 GeV, which we do not use since it has unnaturally large cross\nsection with a large error, (1.56\u00b1 1.11) nb, compared with the next data point from the same\nexperiment, (0.10\u00b1 0.31) nb at 1.45 GeV. The first data points from CMD [62] and DM1 [71]\ncontain data with vanishing cross section with a finite error, which result in points with zero\ncross section even after clustering. We do not use such points when integrating over the data.\nThus the first data point after clustering is at 1.45 GeV. Our evaluation of the contribution\nfrom the 3\u03c0+3\u03c0\u2212 channel from the region\n\u221a\ns < 1.43 GeV is zero for both a\u00b5 and \u2206\u03b1had.\nFor the 2\u03c0+2\u03c0\u22122\u03c00 channel we use five data sets [50, 56, 57, 62, 72], which cover the energy\ninterval from 1.32 GeV to 2.24 GeV. The trapezoidal integration gives us\na\u00b5(2\u03c0\n+2\u03c0\u22122\u03c00,\n\u221a\ns < 1.43 GeV, data) = (0.12\u00b1 0.03)\u00d7 10\u221210, (82)\n\u2206\u03b1had(2\u03c0\n+2\u03c0\u22122\u03c00,\n\u221a\ns < 1.43 GeV, data) = (0.03\u00b1 0.01)\u00d7 10\u22124. (83)\nFor the \u03c0+\u03c0\u22124\u03c00 channel we use the multipion isospin decompositions [118, 119] of both\nthe e+e\u2212 \u2192 6\u03c0 channel and the \u03c4 \u2192 6\u03c0\u03bd\u03c4 decays, which are summarised in the Appendix of\nRef. [120]. Then using the measured ratio [121] of \u03c4\u2212 \u2192 2\u03c0\u2212\u03c0+3\u03c00\u03bd\u03c4 and \u03c4\u2212 \u2192 3\u03c0\u22122\u03c0+\u03c00\u03bd\u03c4\ndecays, and the observed \u03c9 dominance of final states of \u03c4 \u2192 6\u03c0\u03bd\u03c4 decays [120], we find\n\u03c3(\u03c0+\u03c0\u22124\u03c00) = 0.031 \u03c3(2\u03c0+2\u03c0\u22122\u03c00) + 0.093 \u03c3(3\u03c0+3\u03c0\u2212). (84)\nHence we obtain the small \u03c0+\u03c0\u22124\u03c00 contribution17 shown in Table 5. We assign a 100 % error\nto the cross section computed in this way. For ahad,LO\u00b5 and \u2206\u03b1had they are less than 10\n\u221212 and\n10\u22126, respectively, when integrated up to 1.43 GeV.\nFor the \u03b7\u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 channel, we use two data sets [69, 73]. The entry for the \u03b7\u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 channel in\nTable 5 shows the contribution of \u03c3(e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0+\u03c0\u2212) multiplied by (1\u2212 B(\u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c00)\u2212B(\u03b7 \u2192\n\u03c0+\u03c0\u2212\u03c00)) \u2243 0.448, since these \u03b7 decay modes are already included in the contribution of the\n5\u03c0 channels. The contributions to the muon g \u2212 2 and \u2206\u03b1had are\na\u00b5(\u03b7(\u2192 \u03c00\u03b3)\u03c0+\u03c0\u2212,\n\u221a\ns < 1.43 GeV) = (0.07\u00b1 0.01)\u00d7 10\u221210, (85)\n\u2206\u03b1had(\u03b7(\u2192 \u03c00\u03b3)\u03c0+\u03c0\u2212,\n\u221a\ns < 1.43 GeV) = (0.02\u00b1 0.00)\u00d7 10\u22124. (86)\n17Relation (84) was not used in our previous analysis [12]. As a consequence, the (weaker) isospin bound\nthen gave a larger contribution for the pi+pi\u22124pi0 channel. However DEHZ [2] did use the observed information\nof \u03c4 \u2192 6pi\u03bd\u03c4 decays to tighten the isospin bound.\n31\n3.6 K+K\u2212 and KSKL contributions\nFor the K+K\u2212 channel, we use ten data sets [22, 26, 27, 34], [43]\u2013[47], which extend from 1.0\nGeV to 2.1 GeV, see Fig. 14. When integrated, this channel contributes to the muon g\u2212 2 and\n\u2206\u03b1had an amount\na\u00b5(K\n+K\u2212,\n\u221a\ns < 1.43 GeV, data) = (21.62\u00b1 0.76)\u00d7 10\u221210, (87)\n\u2206\u03b1had(K\n+K\u2212,\n\u221a\ns < 1.43 GeV, data) = (3.01\u00b1 0.11)\u00d7 10\u22124. (88)\nFor the K0SK\n0\nL channel, we use ten data sets [10, 14, 47, 48, 49], which also extend from\n1.0 GeV to 2.1 GeV, see Fig. 15. Using the trapezoidal rule, the channel gives a contribution\nto the muon g \u2212 2 and \u2206\u03b1had of\na\u00b5(K\n0\nSK\n0\nL,\n\u221a\ns < 1.43 GeV, data) = (13.16\u00b1 0.31)\u00d7 10\u221210, (89)\n\u2206\u03b1had(K\n0\nSK\n0\nL,\n\u221a\ns < 1.43 GeV, data) = (1.76\u00b1 0.04)\u00d7 10\u22124. (90)\nThis channel is the one case where the use of the trapezoidal rule may overestimate the resonance\ncontribution, due to the lack of data in certain regions of the \u03c6 resonance tails, see Fig. 15.\nWe find that the use of a smooth resonance form in the tails decreases the contributions to a\u00b5\nand \u2206\u03b1had by about 0.15\u00d710\u221210 and 0.02\u00d710\u22124 respectively. We have therefore increased the\nerror in (89) and (90) to include this additional uncertainty.\n3.7 KK\u00af + n\u03c0 contributions\nWe take into account the KK\u00af + n\u03c0 final states for n = 1 and 2.\nFor the KK\u00af\u03c0, in addition to the data for the K0S\u03c0\n\u00b1K\u2213 [74, 75, 76] and K+K\u2212\u03c00 [74, 75]\nchannels, we use the equalities \u03c3(K0L\u03c0K) = \u03c3(K\n0\nS\u03c0K) and \u03c3(K\n0\nSK\n0\nL\u03c0\n0) = \u03c3(K+K\u2212\u03c00), which\nfollow directly from isospin. The contribution from the K0S\u03c0\n\u00b1K\u2213 +K0L\u03c0\n\u00b1K\u2213 channel is\na\u00b5(K\n0\nS\u03c0\n\u00b1K\u2213 +K0L\u03c0\n\u00b1K\u2213,\n\u221a\ns < 1.43 GeV, data and isospin) = (0.10\u00b1 0.04)\u00d7 10\u221210, (91)\n\u2206\u03b1had(K\n0\nS\u03c0\n\u00b1K\u2213 +K0L\u03c0\n\u00b1K\u2213,\n\u221a\ns < 1.43 GeV, data and isospin) = (0.02\u00b1 0.00)\u00d7 10\u22124. (92)\nFor the K+K\u2212\u03c00+K0SK\n0\nL\u03c0\n0 channel, the contribution from the region\n\u221a\ns < 1.43 GeV is taken\nto be zero since the first data point is at 1.44 GeV.\nTo evaluate the KK\u00af\u03c0\u03c0 contribution we use the inclusive data for KSX [77], together with\nthe cross section relation\n2KSX = KSX +KLX\n= 2KSKL + 2(KSKL +KSKS +KLKL)(\u03c0 + \u03c0\u03c0)\n+(KS +KL)(K\u03c0 +K\u03c0\u03c0), (93)\nwhere 2KSX stands for 2\u03c3\n0(e+e\u2212 \u2192 KSX) and similarly for the other abbreviations. On the\nright-hand-side \u03c0\u03c0 stands for \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 or \u03c00\u03c00, K\u03c0 for K+\u03c0\u2212 or K\u2212\u03c0+, and K\u03c0\u03c0 for K+\u03c0\u2212\u03c00 or\n32\n05\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2 2.2\nMEA\nBCF\nDM1\nDM2 (88)\nDM2 (83)\nOLYA\nCMD\nCMD-2\nSND (Scan PHI9801)\nSND (Scan PHI9802)\n\u221as (GeV)\n\u03c3\n0 (K\n+\nK\n-\n)  (\nnb\n)\n\u221as (GeV)\n\u03c3\n0 (K\n+\nK\n-\n)  (\nnb\n)\n0\n250\n500\n750\n1000\n1250\n1500\n1750\n2000\n2250\n2500\n1.01 1.02 1.03\nFigure 14: The data for \u03c30(e+e\u2212 \u2192 K+K\u2212) together with an enlargement of the region of the\n\u03c6 resonance.

The shaded band shows the result of our fit after clustering; however, the errors\non the contribution of this channel to a\u00b5 and \u2206\u03b1had are increased to allow for the lack of data\nin certain regions of the \u03c6 resonance tails, see the discussion in the text.\n34\nK\u2212\u03c0+\u03c00. On the other hand, the KK\u00af\u03c0\u03c0 cross section is given by\nKK\u00af\u03c0\u03c0 = (KSKL +KSKS +KLKL)(\u03c0\u03c0) + (KS +KL)(K\u03c0\u03c0) + (K\n+K\u2212)(\u03c0\u03c0)\n= 2KSX \u2212 2KSKL \u2212 (KSKL +KSKS +KLKL)(2\u03c0 + \u03c0\u03c0)\n\u22122KS(K\u03c0) + (K+K\u2212)(\u03c0\u03c0)\n= 2(KSX \u2212KSKL \u2212K+K\u2212\u03c0 \u2212KS(K\u03c0)), (94)\nwhere to obtain the second equality we have used (93). In other words, the total KK\u00af\u03c0\u03c0 contri-\nbution is obtained from twice the inclusive KSX cross section by subtracting the appropriate\nKK\u00af and KK\u00af\u03c0 contributions. For this channel, the contribution from the region\n\u221a\ns < 1.43\nGeV is also taken to be zero since the data of the K0SX final state start from 1.44 GeV.\n3.8 Unaccounted modes\nWe still have to take into account contributions from the reactions e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c00 and e+e\u2212 \u2192\n\u03c9\u03c0+\u03c0\u2212, in which the \u03c9 decays radiatively into \u03c00\u03b3. We used seven data sets for the e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c00\nchannel [22, 51, 53], [58]\u2013[61], and three data sets [38, 69, 70] for the e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 channel.\nNote that the contributions from the \u03c9(\u2192 \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212\u03c00)\u03c00 and \u03c9(\u2192 \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212)\u03c00 channels are already\nincluded as a part of the multi-pion channels. We therefore need simply to multiply the original\ncross section \u03c3(e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c00) by the branching ratio B(\u03c9 \u2192 \u03c00\u03b3) = 0.087 [104]. The same\ncomments apply for the \u03c9\u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 channel. The two channels give contributions\na\u00b5(\u03c9(\u2192 \u03c00\u03b3)\u03c00,\n\u221a\ns < 1.43 GeV) = (0.64\u00b1 0.02)\u00d7 10\u221210, (95)\n\u2206\u03b1had(\u03c9(\u2192 \u03c00\u03b3)\u03c00,\n\u221a\ns < 1.43 GeV) = (0.12\u00b1 0.00)\u00d7 10\u22124, (96)\nand\na\u00b5(\u03c9(\u2192 \u03c00\u03b3)\u03c0+\u03c0\u2212,\n\u221a\ns < 1.43 GeV) = (0.01\u00b1 0.00)\u00d7 10\u221210, (97)\n\u2206\u03b1had(\u03c9(\u2192 \u03c00\u03b3)\u03c0+\u03c0\u2212,\n\u221a\ns < 1.43 GeV) = (0.00\u00b1 0.00)\u00d7 10\u22124, (98)\nrespectively.\nPurely neutral contributions from the direct decays of \u03c1 and \u03c9 to \u03c00\u03c00\u03b3 can be safely\nneglected, as the branching fractions are of the order 5\u00d7 10\u22125 and 7\u00d7 10\u22125 respectively [104,\n122, 123], and are suppressed compared to the decays into \u03c00\u03b3.\nFor the \u03c6 resonance we have so far accounted for the \u03c6 \u2192 K+K\u2212, K0SK0L, 3\u03c0, \u03b7\u03b3 and\n\u03c00\u03b3 channels. Since the branching fractions of these final states add up to 99.8% [104], we\nmust allow for the 0.2% from the remaining final states. To do this, we first note that the\ncontribution to ahad,LO\u00b5 from the K\n+K\u2212 channel in the \u03c6 region is\na\u00b5(\u03c6\u2192 K+K\u2212; 2mK+ <\n\u221a\ns < 1.03 GeV) = 16.15\u00d7 10\u221210. (99)\nUsing this, we estimate that the total contribution from the \u03c6 to be\na\u00b5(\u03c6) = a\u00b5(\u03c6\u2192 K+K\u2212)\/B(\u03c6\u2192 K+K\u2212) = 32\u00d7 10\u221210.\n35\nHence we include the small residual contribution\na\u00b5(\u03c6\u2192 remaining channels) = a\u00b5(\u03c6)\u00d7 0.002 = 0.06\u00d7 10\u221210, (100)\nand assign to it a 100% error. In a similar way the contribution \u2206\u03b1had(\u03c6 \u2192 K+K\u2212) =\n2.12\u00d7 10\u22124 is used to estimate\n\u2206\u03b1had(\u03c6\u2192 remaining channels) = 0.01\u00d7 10\u22124, (101)\nto which we again assign a 100% error.\n3.9 Baryon-pair contribution\nIf we are to integrate up to high enough energy to pair-produce baryons, we have to take into\naccount the pp\u00af and nn\u00af final states. The data come from the FENICE [78, 79], DM1 [82] and\nDM2 [80, 81] collaborations for the pp\u00af channel, and from the FENICE collaboration [78, 83]\nfor the nn\u00af channel.

(105)\n3.10 Narrow resonance (J\/\u03c8, \u03c8\u2032,\u03a5) contributions\nWe add the contributions from the narrow resonances, J\/\u03c8, \u03c8\u2032 and \u03a5(1S\u22126S). We treat them\nin the zero-width approximation, in which the total production cross section of a vector meson\nV (V = J\/\u03c8, \u03c8\u2032,\u03a5) is\n\u03c3(e+e\u2212 \u2192 V ) = 12\u03c02 \u0393\n0\nee\nMV\n\u03b4(s\u2212M2V ).

We use the\nvalues compiled in RPP for the leptonic widths, \u0393(V \u2192 e+e\u2212), and obtain the contributions\na\u00b5(J\/\u03c8) = (5.89\u00b1 0.41)\u00d7 10\u221210, (109)\na\u00b5(\u03c8\n\u2032) = (1.41\u00b1 0.12)\u00d7 10\u221210, (110)\na\u00b5(\u03a5(1S)) = (0.05\u00b1 0.00)\u00d7 10\u221210, (111)\na\u00b5(\u03a5(2S \u2212 6S)) = (0.05\u00b1 0.00)\u00d7 10\u221210, (112)\n36\n\u03b3\u03b32\nMEA\nM3N\nBBbar\n\u221as (GeV)\nR\n(s)\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n3.5\n1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2\nBES (01)\nCB (86)\nCB (90)\nCB (90)\nCB (88)\nLENA\nMD-1\nDASP\nCLEO\nCUSB\nDHHM\nBES (99)\n\u221as (GeV)\nR\n(s)\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n3.5\n4\n4.5\n5\n5.5\n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11\nFigure 16: Data for the measurement of the inclusive hadronic cross section below 2 GeV (left)\nand above 2 GeV (right).

(116)\n3.11 Inclusive hadronic data contribution (\n\u221a\ns < 11.09 GeV)\nWe use four data sets below 2 GeV [84]\u2013[87], and twelve data sets above 2 GeV [88]\u2013[98] (see\nFig. 16). Below 2 GeV, we correct for the unaccounted modes. Namely, we add the contributions\nfrom the \u03c9(\u2192 \u03c00\u03b3)\u03c00 and K0S(\u2192 2\u03c00)K0L\u03c00 channels to the experimentally observed R-ratio,\nsince the final states of these channels consist only of electrically neutral particles, which are\nhard to see experimentally. They shift the R values by roughly 1%, depending on\n\u221a\ns. In\naddition we correct some experiments for the contributions from missing two-body final states,\nas discussed at the end of Section 2. We have also checked that corrections for \u03b3\u2212Z interference\neffects are completely negligible in the energy range below 11.09 GeV where we use data.\nThe contributions to the muon g \u2212 2 and \u2206\u03b1had are, from 1.43 <\n\u221a\ns < 2 GeV,\na\u00b5(inclusive,\n\u221a\ns < 2 GeV) = (31.91\u00b1 2.42)\u00d7 10\u221210, (117)\n\u2206\u03b1had(inclusive,\n\u221a\ns < 2 GeV) = (10.78\u00b1 0.81)\u00d7 10\u22124, (118)\nand from 2 <\n\u221a\ns < 11.09 GeV,\na\u00b5(inclusive, 2 <\n\u221a\ns < 11.09 GeV) = (42.05\u00b1 1.14)\u00d7 10\u221210, (119)\n\u2206\u03b1had(inclusive, 2 <\n\u221a\ns < 11.09 GeV) = (81.97\u00b1 1.53)\u00d7 10\u22124, (120)\n37\nrespectively.\n3.12 Inclusive pQCD contribution (\n\u221a\ns > 11.09 GeV)\nAbove 11 GeV we use perturbative QCD to evaluate the contributions to ahad,LO\u00b5 and \u2206\u03b1(M\n2\nZ).\nWe incorporate O(\u03b13S) massless quark contributions, and the O(\u03b12S) massive quark contribu-\ntions [107, 124, 125, 126, 127]. We have checked that our code agrees very well with the code\nrhad written by Harlander and Steinhauser [128]. As input parameters, we use\n\u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) = 0.1172\u00b1 0.002, mt = 174.3\u00b1 5.1 GeV, mb = 4.85\u00b1 0.25 GeV, (121)\nand allow for an uncertainty in the renormalization scale of\n\u221a\ns\/2 < \u00b5 < 2\n\u221a\ns. Here mt and mb\nare the pole masses of the top and bottom quark. We obtain\na\u00b5(pQCD,\n\u221a\ns > 11.09 GeV) = (2.11\u00b1 0.00)\u00d7 10\u221210, (122)\nwhere the uncertainty from \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) is dominant, which is less than 1 \u00d7 10\u221212. Similarly, for\n\u2206\u03b1had we find\n\u2206\u03b1had(pQCD,\n\u221a\ns > 11.09 GeV) = (125.32\u00b1 0.14\u00b1 0.02\u00b1 0.01)\u00d7 10\u22124 (123)\n= (125.32\u00b1 0.15)\u00d7 10\u22124, (124)\nwhere the first error comes from the uncertainty in \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ), the second from the renormalization\nscale \u00b5, and the third from that on the mass of the bottom quark.\n3.13 Total contribution to the dispersion integrals\nTo summarize, Table 5 shows the values obtained for ahad,LO\u00b5 and \u2206\u03b1had, as well as showing the\ncontributions of the individual channels. Summing all the contributions we obtain\nahad,LO\u00b5 (incl.) = (692.38\u00b1 5.88exp)\u00d7 10\u221210, (125)\nahad,LO\u00b5 (excl.) = (696.15\u00b1 5.68exp)\u00d7 10\u221210, (126)\nwhere \u201cincl.\u201d means that we have used the inclusive data sets for 1.43 <\n\u221a\ns < 2 GeV, while\n\u201cexcl.\u201d means that we used the exclusive data at the same interval. \u201cexp.\u201d means that the\nerrors are from the experimental uncertainty. The corresponding results for \u2206\u03b1had are\n\u2206\u03b1had(incl.) = (275.52\u00b1 1.85exp)\u00d7 10\u22124, (127)\n\u2206\u03b1had(excl.) = (276.90\u00b1 1.77exp)\u00d7 10\u22124. (128)\nWe see that using the sum of the data for exclusive channels to determine R(s), in the in-\ntermediate energy interval 1.43 <\n\u221a\ns < 2 GeV, yields values for ahad,LO\u00b5 and \u2206\u03b1had which\nsignificantly exceed the values obtained using the inclusive data for R(s). The mean values\ndiffer by about 2\/3 of the total experimental error. In Fig. 17 we show the hadronic R ratio as\na function of\n\u221a\ns. A careful inspection of the figure shows the discrepancy between the inclusive\n38\nand exclusive data sets in the interval 1.43 <\n\u221a\ns < 2 GeV, see Fig. 4. The contribution from\nthis region alone is\nahad,LO\u00b5 (1.43 <\n\u221a\ns < 2 GeV, incl.) = (31.91\u00b1 2.42exp)\u00d7 10\u221210, (129)\nahad,LO\u00b5 (1.43 <\n\u221a\ns < 2 GeV, excl.) = (35.68\u00b1 1.71exp)\u00d7 10\u221210, (130)\nand for \u2206\u03b1had,\n\u2206\u03b1had(1.43 <\n\u221a\ns < 2 GeV, incl.) = (10.78\u00b1 0.81exp)\u00d7 10\u22124, (131)\n\u2206\u03b1had(1.43 <\n\u221a\ns < 2 GeV, excl.) = (12.17\u00b1 0.59exp)\u00d7 10\u22124. (132)\nIn the next Section we introduce QCD sum rules that are able to determine which choice of\nR(s) is consistent. We find that the sum rules strongly favour the use of the inclusive data in\nthe above intermediate energy interval.\nTable 7 shows the breakdown of the contributions versus energy. It is also useful to show\nthe breakdown visually in terms of \u2018pie\u2019 diagrams. The \u2018pie\u2019 diagrams on the left-hand\nside of Fig. 18 show the fraction of the total contributions to ahad,LO\u00b5 and \u2206\u03b1had coming from\nvarious energy intervals of the dispersion integrals (4) and (5). The plots on the right-hand-side\nindicate the fractional contributions to the square of the total error, including the error due to\nthe treatment of radiative corrections. The values shown for ahad,LO\u00b5 in these plots correspond\nto using the inclusive data in the intermediate energy interval.\nIn Section 7 we use the value of ahad,LO\u00b5 , along with the QED, weak and other hadronic\ncontributions, to predict the value of g \u2212 2 of the muon. In Section 8 we use the value of\n\u2206\u03b1had(M\n2\nZ) to predict the value of the QED coupling on the Z pole, \u03b1(M\n2\nZ).\n4 Resolution of the ambiguity: QCD sum rules\nTo decide between the exclusive and inclusive data in the energy range 1.43 <\n\u221a\ns < 2 GeV\n(see Fig. 4), we make use of QCD sum rules [129], see also the review [130]. The sum rules are\nbased on the analyticity of the vacuum polarization function \u03a0(q2), from which it follows that\na relation of the form \u222b s0\nsth\nds R(s)f(s) =\n\u222b\nC\nds D(s)g(s) (133)\nmust be satisfied for a non-singular function f(s). C is a circular contour of radius s0 and g(s)\nis a known function once f(s) is given. The lower limit of integration, sth, is 4m\n2\npi, except for a\nsmall e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c00\u03b3 contribution. D(s) is the Adler D function,\nD(s) \u2261 \u221212\u03c02s d\nds\n(\n\u03a0(s)\ns\n)\n, where R(s) =\n12\u03c0\ns\nIm\u03a0(s). (134)\nProvided that s0 is chosen sufficiently large for D(s) to be evaluated from QCD, the sum rules\nallow consistency checks of the behaviour of the data for R(s) for s < s0. Indeed, by choosing\nan appropriate form of the function f(s) we can highlight the average behaviour of R(s) over\n39\n00.5 1\n1.5 2\n2.5 3\n3.5 4\n4.5 5\n1\n10\nJ\/\u03c8\n\u03c8(2S)\n\u03d2\n\u221a\ns (GeV)\nR(s)\nFigure 17: The hadronic R ratio as a function of\n\u221a\ns.

The pie diagrams for the LO hadronic contribution to\ng \u2212 2, shown in the first row, correspond to sub-contributions with energy boundaries at\nmpi, 0.6, 0.9, 1.4, 2 GeV and \u221e, whereas for the hadronic contribution to the QED coupling,\nshown in the second row, the boundaries are at mpi, 0.6, 0.9, 1.4, 2, 4, 11.09 GeV and \u221e. In the\n(error)2 pie diagrams we also included the (error)2 arising from the treatment of the radiative\ncorrections to the data.\n41\na particular energy domain. To be specific, we take s0 just below the open charm threshold\n(say\n\u221a\ns0 = 3.7 GeV) and choose forms for f(s) which emphasize the most ambiguous range\n(1.5 <\u223c\n\u221a\ns <\u223c 2 GeV) of R(s), so that the discriminating power of the sum rules is maximized.\nWe therefore use the three flavour (nf = 3) QCD expressions for D(s), and omit the J\/\u03c8 and\n\u03c8(2S) cc\u00af resonance contributions to R(s).\nTo evaluate the function D(s) from QCD, it is convenient to express it as the sum of three\ncontributions,\nD(s) = D0(s) +Dm(s) +Dnp(s), (135)\nwhere D0 is the O(\u03b1\n3\nS) massless, three-flavour QCD prediction, Dm is the (small) quark mass\ncorrection and Dnp is a (very small) contribution estimated using knowledge of the condensates.\nD0 is given by [124]\nD0(\u2212s) = 3\n\u2211\nf\nQ2f\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\uf8f31 + \u03b1S(s)\u03c0 + d1\n(\n\u03b1S(s)\n\u03c0\n)2\n+ d\u02dc2\n(\n\u03b1S(s)\n\u03c0\n)3\n+O\n(\n\u03b14S(s)\n)\uf8fc\uf8fd\uf8fe , (136)\nwith\nd1 = 1.9857\u2212 0.1153nf , (137)\nd\u02dc2 = d2 +\n\u03b220\u03c0\n2\n48\n(\nwith \u03b20 = 11\u2212 2nf\n3\n)\n, (138)\nd2 = \u22126.6368\u2212 1.2001nf \u2212 0.0052n2f \u2212 1.2395\n(\n\u2211\nf Qf )\n2\n3\n\u2211\nf Q\n2\nf\n, (139)\nwhere the sum f runs over u, d and s flavours. Qf is the electric charge of quark f , which takes\nthe values 2\/3, \u22121\/3, and \u22121\/3 for u, d and s, respectively.

(140)\nWe take the MS s-quark mass at 2 GeV ms(4 GeV\n2) to be 120\u00b1 40 MeV, and we neglect the\nu and d quark masses. The contribution from condensates, Dnp, is given by\nDnp(\u2212s) = 3\n\u2211\nf\nQ2f\n{\n2\u03c02\n3\n(\n1\u2212 11\n18\n\u03b1S(s)\n\u03c0\n) \u3008(\u03b1S\/\u03c0)GG\u3009\ns2\n+ 8\u03c02\n(\n1\u2212 \u03b1S(s)\n\u03c0\n) \u3008mfqfqf \u3009\ns2\n+\n32\u03c02\n27\n\u03b1S(s)\n\u03c0\n\u2211\nk\n\u3008mkqkqk\u3009\ns2\n+ 12\u03c02\n\u3008O6\u3009\ns3\n+ 16\u03c02\n\u3008O8\u3009\ns4\n\uf8fc\uf8fd\uf8fe , (141)\nwhere, following [132], we take\u2329\n\u03b1S\n\u03c0\nGG\n\u232a\n= 0.037\u00b1 0.019 (GeV4),\n\u3008mss\u00afs\u3009 = \u2212f 2pim2K . (142)\n42\nHere fpi \u2243 92 MeV is the pion decay constant, and mK is the kaon mass. As we will see\nlater, the quark mass corrections and the condensate contributions are very tiny\u2014typically at\nmost a few percent of the whole QCD contribution. Hence we neglect the higher dimensional\ncondensates, \u3008O6\u3009 and \u3008O8\u3009.\nAs for the weight function f(s), we take it to be of the form (1 \u2212 s\/s0)m(s\/s0)n with\nn +m = 0, 1 or 2. For these six choices of f(s), the function g(s) may be readily evaluated,\nand the sum rules, (133), become\u222b s0\nsth\ndsR(s) =\ni\n2\u03c0\n\u222b\nC\nds\n{\n1\u2212 s0\ns\n}\nD(s), (143)\u222b s0\nsth\ndsR(s)\ns\ns0\n=\ni\n2\u03c0\n\u222b\nC\nds\n1\n2\n{\ns\ns0\n\u2212 s0\ns\n}\nD(s), (144)\u222b s0\nsth\ndsR(s)\n(\n1\u2212 s\ns0\n)\n=\ni\n2\u03c0\n\u222b\nC\nds\n{\n\u22121\n2\ns\ns0\n+ 1\u2212 1\n2\ns0\ns\n}\nD(s), (145)\u222b s0\nsth\ndsR(s)\n(\ns\ns0\n)2\n=\ni\n2\u03c0\n\u222b\nC\nds\n1\n3\n{(\ns\ns0\n)2\n\u2212 s0\ns\n}\nD(s), (146)\n\u222b s0\nsth\ndsR(s)\n(\n1\u2212 s\ns0\n)\ns\ns0\n=\ni\n2\u03c0\n\u222b\nC\nds\n{\n\u22121\n3\n(\ns\ns0\n)2\n+\n1\n2\ns\ns0\n\u2212 1\n6\ns0\ns\n}\nD(s), (147)\n\u222b s0\nsth\ndsR(s)\n(\n1\u2212 s\ns0\n)2\n=\ni\n2\u03c0\n\u222b\nC\nds\n{\n1\n3\n(\ns\ns0\n)2\n\u2212 s\ns0\n+ 1\u2212 1\n3\ns0\ns\n}\nD(s). (148)\nWe evaluate each of these sum rules for\n\u221a\ns0 = 3.7 GeV using the clustered data values\nof R(s) of Section 2 on the l.h.s., and QCD for D(s) (with \u03b1S = 0.1172 \u00b1 0.0020 [104]) on\nthe r.h.s. We find, as anticipated, that the sum rules with m = 0 and n = 1 or 2 have very\nsmall contributions from the disputed 1.43\u20142 GeV region. Indeed, this region contributes only\nabout 5% and 2%, respectively, of the total contribution to the l.h.s. of (144) and (146). They\nemphasize the region s <\u223c s0 and so essentially test data against perturbative QCD in this small\ndomain. They are not useful for our purpose. The results for the remaining four sum rules are\nshown by the numbers in brackets in Fig. 19. For this choice of s0, the sum rules with m = 1\nor 2 and n = 0 are found to maximize the fractional contribution to the sum rule coming from\nthe 1.43 <\n\u221a\ns < 2 GeV interval. These two sum rules clearly favour the inclusive over the\nexclusive data.\nThe comparison between the data and QCD can be translated into another form. We can\ntreat \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) as a free parameter, and calculate the value which makes the r.h.s. of a sum rule\nexactly balance the l.h.s. The results are shown in Fig. 19. We can see that in this comparison\nthe determination from the inclusive data is more consistent with the world-average value,\n\u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) = 0.1172\u00b1 0.0020 [104].\nFor illustration, we show in Table 8 a detailed breakdown of the contributions to both\nsides of the sum rule for the cases of m = 2, n = 0 and m = n = 0. If we compare the\nbreakdown of the contribution from the data in both cases, we can see that the weight function\nf(s) = (1\u2212 s\/s0)2 highlights the most ambiguous region of R(s) very well. When we look into\nthe breakdown in the QCD part, we can see that the QCD contribution is dominated by the\nmassless part.\nWe repeated the sum rule analysis for\n\u221a\ns0 = 3.0 GeV, see Fig. 19. The lower value of\n43\ns0 means that more weight is given to the disputed 1.43\u20142 GeV region. Taken together, we\nsee that the sum rules strongly favour the behaviour of R(s) from the inclusive measurements.\nIndeed, the overall consistency in this case is remarkable. This result can also be clearly seen\nfrom Fig. 19, which compares the world average value of \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) with the predictions of the\nindividual sum rules for, first\n\u221a\ns0 = 3.7 GeV and then for\n\u221a\ns0 = 3 GeV. Again the consistency\nwith the inclusive measurements of R(s) is apparent.\n0.1 0.12 0.14\n\u03b1S(M 2Z)\ninclusive\ninclusive\ninclusive\ninclusive\ninclusive\ninclusive\ninclusive\ninclusive\nexclusive\nexclusive\nexclusive\nexclusive\nexclusive\nexclusive\nexclusive\nexclusive\n(m,n,\u221as\u20130) data (fraction (%))\n(0,0,3.7) (13.0)\n(1,0,3.7) (20.3)\n(1,1,3.7) (12.9)\n(2,0,3.7) (24.0)\n(0,0,3) (19.9)\n(1,0,3) (26.9)\n(1,1,3) (26.3)\n(2,0,3) (27.2)\n(0,0,3.7) (15.4)\n(1,0,3.7) (23.7)\n(1,1,3.7) (15.5)\n(2,0,3.7) (27.8)\n(0,0,3) (23.3)\n(1,0,3) (30.8)\n(1,1,3) (30.3)\n(2,0,3) (31.0)\nFigure 19: The QCD sum rule predictions for \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) compared with the world average\nvalue [104]. The results for the four sum rules for two values of\n\u221a\ns0 are shown. In each\ncase we show results for the inclusive and the exclusive measurement of R(s) in the intermedi-\nate energy region. We also give in brackets the fractional contribution to the sum rule coming\nfrom the 1.43 <\n\u221a\ns < 2 GeV interval.\nThe same conclusion with regard to the resolution of the inclusive\/exclusive ambiguity in\nthe 1.43 <\n\u221a\ns < 2 GeV interval was reached in an independent analysis [133].\nIn an attempt to understand the origin of the discrepancy, we have studied the effect of\npossibly missing (purely neutral) modes in the inclusive data, but found that these cannot\nexplain the difference. One should, however, keep in mind that the precision of both the (old)\ninclusive and the exclusive data in this energy regime is quite poor. We expect that future\n44\nmeasurements at B-factories (via radiative return) and at the upgraded machine VEPP-2000\nin Novosibirsk will improve the situation in the future.\n5 Comparison with other predictions of g \u2212 2\nFig. 20 shows other determinations of ahad,LO\u00b5 , together with the values (HMNT(03)) obtained\nin this work. The values listed below the first dashed line incorporate the new more precise\ndata on e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 [11] into the analysis. These data play a dominant role, and, as can\nbe seen from the Figure, significantly decrease the value of ahad\u00b5 . However, very recently, the\nCMD-2 Collaboration have re-analysed their data and found that they should be increased by\napproximately 2%, depending on\n\u221a\ns. The new data [10] are included in our analysis. Inspection\nof Fig. 20 shows that the re-analysis of the CMD-2 data has led to an increase of ahad,LO\u00b5 \u00d7 1010\nby about 10.\n680 690 700 710 720\na\u00b5\nhad,LO\u00d7 1010\nEidelman & Jegerlehner (95)\nAdel & Yndurain (95)\nBrown & Worstell (96)\nAlemany et al.

The entries\nbelow the first dashed line include the new CMD-2 \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 data [11], and the values below the\nsecond dashed line include the re-analysed CMD-2 \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 data [10].\nThe entries denoted by \u201cDEHZ (\u03c4)\u201d also used information from hadronic \u03c4 decays [2, 3],\n45\nwhich through CVC give independent information on the e+e\u2212 \u2192 2\u03c0 and 4\u03c0 channels for\u221a\ns <\u223c m\u03c4 . The apparent discrepancy between the prediction from this analysis and the pure\ne+e\u2212 analyses is not yet totally understood, however see the remarks in the Introduction.\n5.1 Comparison with the DEHZ evaluation\nIt is particularly informative to compare the individual contributions to ahad,LO\u00b5 obtained in the\npresent analysis with those listed in the recent study of Davier et al. (DEHZ03) [3], which used\nessentially the same e+e\u2212 \u2192 hadrons data. Such a comparison highlights regions of uncertainty,\nand indicates areas where further data and study could significantly improve the theoretical\ndetermination of g\u2212 2. DEHZ provided a detailed breakdown of their contributions to ahad,LO\u00b5 ,\nand so, to facilitate the comparison, we have broken down our contributions into the energy\nintervals that they use. Table 9 shows the two sets of contributions of the individual e+e\u2212\nchannels to dispersion relation (44) in the crucial low energy region with\n\u221a\ns < 1.8 GeV.\nThe last column of Table 9 shows the discrepancy between the two analyses. The biggest\ndifference occurs in the \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 channel, which gives the main contribution to ahad,LO\u00b5 , and the\nimprovement in the SM prediction essentially comes from the recent higher precision CMD-\n2 data in the region 0.6 <\n\u221a\ns < 0.9 GeV (see the remarks in Chapter 3.2). We find that\nthis difference, 2.6 \u00d7 10\u221210, appears to come from the region just above the \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 threshold,\nespecially in the region\n\u221a\ns \u223c 0.4 GeV, see Fig. 21. The figure shows the \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 contribution\nplotted in such a way that the area under the curves (or data band) gives the contribution to\ndispersion relation (44) for ahad,LO\u00b5 . To determine the low energy \u03c0\n+\u03c0\u2212 contribution, DEHZ [2]\nfirst perform a three-parameter fit to \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 data for\n\u221a\ns < 0.6 GeV, and obtain the dashed\ncurve in Fig. 21. This is then used to compute the \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 contribution of (58.04\u00b1 2.06)\u00d7 10\u221210\nfor\n\u221a\ns < 0.5 GeV. They do not use either the NA718 [20] or the preliminary CMD-2 data. On\nthe other hand we use the chiral description [136], shown by the continuous curve, only as far\nas\n\u221a\ns = 0.32 GeV; and then use the band obtained from our clustered data, which include\ndata from OLYA [16], TOF [19], NA7 [20], CMD [21] and DM1 [23] in this energy region. In\nthis way we obtain a \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 contribution for\n\u221a\ns < 0.5 GeV of (55.7 \u00b1 1.9) \u00d7 10\u221210. We also\nshow on Fig. 21 the preliminary CMD-2 data, obtained from Fig. 3 of Ref. [134]. These data\nwere used in neither analysis, but do seem to favour the lower \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 contribution. It is also\ninteresting to note that DEHZ [2, 3] obtain the low value of (56.0\u00b1 1.6)\u00d7 10\u221210 if \u03c4 decay and\nCVC are used in this region.\nOther significant, with respect to the errors, discrepancies arise in the \u03c00\u03b3 + \u03b7\u03b3 and the\nK0SK\n0\nL channels, where the treatment is different: DEHZ integrate over Breit\u2013Wigner resonance\nparametrizations (assuming that the KK channels are saturated by the \u03c6 decay), while we are\nintegrating the available data in these channels directly. In our method there is no danger to\nomit or double-count interference effects and resonance contributions from tails still present at\ncontinuum energies, and the error estimate is straight forward. As a check, we made fits to\nBreit\u2013Wigner-type resonance forms and studied the possibility that trapezoidal integration of\nconcave structures overestimate the resonance contributions. We found the possible effects are\n18However, recently it has turned out that earlier worries about a systematic bias in the NA7 data as mentioned\nin [2] are not justified and that there is no reason to neglect these important data [135].\n46\nNA7 (84)\nCMD (85)\nTOF (81)\nOLYA (79)\nDM1 (78)\nCMD-2 preliminary\ns (GeV2)\nm\n\u00b52\n \n\/(3\ns) \n\u03c3\n0 (pi\n+\npi\n\u2013\n) K\n(s)\n (n\nb)\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n0.08 0.1 0.12 0.14 0.16 0.18 0.2 0.22 0.24\nFigure 21: The \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 data just above threshold, plotted so that the area gives the contribution\nto dispersion relation (44) for ahad,LO\u00b5 .

The one exception is the \u03c6\u2192 K0SK0L contribution. Here the lack of data in\ncertain regions of the resonance tails (see Fig. 15) has caused us to increase the uncertainty on\nthis contribution to a\u00b5, see Section 3.6.\nApart from these channels, it is only the two four-pion channels which show uncomfortably\nlarge and relevant discrepancies. Here, the data input is different between DEHZ and our\nanalysis. We use, in addition to DEHZ, also data from \u03b3\u03b32 [56, 66] and ORSAY-ACO [55] for\nboth 4\u03c0 channels, and data from M3N [50] and two more data sets from CMD-2 [67, 68] for\nthe \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212\u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 channel. However, it should be noted, that the available data are not entirely\nconsistent, a fact reflected in the poor \u03c72min\/d.o.f. of our fits resulting in the need of error\ninflation19. Clearly, in these channels, new and better data is required. As mentioned already\nin Section 3.5, the situation is expected to improve as soon as the announced re-analysis from\nCMD-2 will become available.\nThere are no data available for some of the exclusive channels. Their contribution to the\ndispersion relation is computed using isospin relations. The corresponding entries in Table 9\nhave been marked by the word \u201cisospin\u201d.\n5.2 Possible contribution of the \u03c3(600) resonance to g \u2212 2\nThis subsection is motivated by the claim [137] that the isosinglet scalar boson20 \u03c3(600) can\nhave a non-negligible contribution to the muon g \u2212 2. Here, we evaluate its contribution and\nfind that it is at most of order 0.1\u00d7 10\u221210. This is negligible as compared to the uncertainty of\nthe hadronic vacuum polarization contribution of 6\u00d7 10\u221210, and hence we can safely neglect it.\nThe argument presented in Ref. [137] is twofold. First \u03c3 may contribute to the muon g \u2212 2\nthrough unaccounted decay modes of the narrow spin 1 resonances into the \u03c3\u03b3 channel. The\nsecond possibility, considered in [137], is that \u03c3 may contribute directly to the muon g \u2212 2\nthrough its coupling to the muon pair. We estimate the two contributions below.\nIn the zero-width limit, narrow spin 1 resonances, V , contribute to the muon g \u2212 2 as\naV\u00b5 = (3\/\u03c0)K(m\n2\nV )\u0393(V \u2192 ee)\/mV , (149)\nwhere K(m2V ) is the kernel function (45) at s = m\n2\nV . We find, for example\n21,\na\u03c9\u00b5 = 391\u00d7 10\u221210, (150)\na\u03c6\u00b5 = 39\u00d7 10\u221210, (151)\na\u03c6(1.68)\u00b5 = 3.4\u00d7 10\u221210, (152)\nwhere, in (152), we have used \u0393(\u03c6(1.68) \u2192 ee) = 0.48 keV [104] to give a rough estimate.\nIf the decays V \u2192 \u03c3\u03b3 of the above vector bosons escape detection, a fraction of the above\n19If for a given channel \u03c72min\/d.o.f. > 1.2, then we enlarge the error by\n\u221a\n\u03c72min\/d.o.f.. This was necessary for\nthree channels, see Section 2.4.\n20\u03c3(600) is denoted by f0(600) in the Review of Particle Physics [104].\n21We take vector mesons, V , which, according to [137], may have significant contributions.\n48\ncontributions up to B(V \u2192 \u03c3\u03b3) may have been missed. On the other hand we find that 99.8%\nof \u03c6 decays has been accounted for in the five decay channels explicitly included in our analysis\nhence B(\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c3\u03b3) < 0.002. This severely constrains the \u03c3\u03b3\u03b3 coupling. Hence we can use the\nVector Meson Dominance (VMD) approximation to show that the other branching fractions\nsatisfy B(\u03c9 \u2192 \u03c3\u03b3) < 7.2 \u00d7 10\u22125 and B(\u03c6(1.68) \u2192 \u03c3\u03b3) < 3.5 \u00d7 10\u22125, see Appendix B. By\ninserting these constraints into the estimates (150)\u2013(152), we find that the unaccounted V \u2192 \u03c3\u03b3\ncontributions to g \u2212 2 of the muon are less than (2.8, 7.8, 0.01)\u00d7 10\u221212 for V = \u03c9, \u03c6, \u03c6(1.68)\nrespectively, assuming m\u03c3 = 600 MeV. These estimates are much smaller than those presented\nin [137]. It is clear that the total contribution of unaccounted \u03c3\u03b3 modes through narrow\nresonance decays is negligibly small. It is also worth pointing out here that the unaccounted\nfraction 0.2% of the \u03c6 contribution (7.8 \u00d7 10\u221212 above) has been taken into account in our\nanalysis, whether it is \u03c6\u2192 \u03c3\u03b3 or not.\nWe now turn to the \u03c3 contribution to the muon g\u22122 through its direct coupling to a muon-\npair. To evaluate this, it is essential to estimate the magnitude of the \u03c3\u00b5\u00b5 coupling. Since the\ncoupling through the \u03c3-Higgs boson mixing is negligibly small, the leading contribution should\ncome from two-photon exchange. In this regard, the effective coupling strength should be of\nthe same order as that of the \u03b7 isoscalar pseudoscalar meson, which should also be dominated\nby the two-photon exchange. By using the observed width \u0393(\u03b7 \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5), and by neglecting the\nform factor suppression, we find that the point-like \u03b7 contribution to the muon g \u2212 2 is\na\u03b7\u00b5 = \u22123\u00d7 10\u221213, (153)\nwhich is negligibly small. It follows that this implies that a\u03c3\u00b5 is also negligibly small, see (164)\nbelow. However, the discussion can be made far more general. It is presented in the next\nSection.\n6 Internal light-by-light contributions\nIn this section we present a very primitive discussion of the hadronic contribution to the internal\nlight-by-light amplitudes, motivated by the study of the direct \u03c3 and \u03b7 contributions to the\nmuon g \u2212 2.\nThe meaning of \u2018internal\u2019 can be seen from Fig. 22. We call the diagram on the right\n\u2018internal\u2019 to distinguish it from the left diagram, that is the familiar light-by-light contribution\nwhich, here, we call \u2018external\u2019. We should note that the external light-by-light diagram is of\nO(\u03b13) and the internal light-by-light diagram is an O(\u03b14) contribution.\n6.1 Internal meson contributions\nJust like the external light-by-light amplitude is dominated by a single pseudoscalar meson\ncontribution [138]\u2013[141], it is likely that the hadronic contribution to the internal light-by-light\namplitudes is dominated by a single meson exchange contribution.\nIn general, we can estimate the internal contribution to a\u00b5 from arbitrary scalar and pseu-\n49\n..\n.\n.\nhad.\n\u00b5\nexternal\nhad.\n\u00b5\ninternal\nFigure 22: External and internal light-by-light contributions to g \u2212 2. The former is an O(\u03b13)\nand the latter is an O(\u03b14) contribution. In this paper we compute the contribution of the\ninternal diagram. In Section 6.1 we take the shaded blob to be scalar (\u03c3) or pseudoscalar\n(\u03c00, \u03b7) mesons, whereas in Section 6.2 we take it to be a light (u, d, s) quark loop, using the\nresult for lepton (e, \u00b5) loops as a guide.\ndoscalar mesons. Using the effective coupling\nL = \u03c8\u00af\u00b5(gSS + igP\u03b35P )\u03c8\u00b5, (154)\nwe find [142]\naS\u00b5 =\ng2S\n48\u03c02\nr\n(1\u2212 r)4\n[\n6(1\u2212 2r) ln 1\nr\n\u2212 7 + 24r \u2212 21r2 + 4r3\n]\n, (155)\naP\u00b5 =\ng2P\n48\u03c02\nr\n(1\u2212 r)4\n[\n\u22126 ln 1\nr\n+ 11\u2212 18r + 9r2 \u2212 2r3\n]\n, (156)\nwhere r \u2261 m2\u00b5\/m2h, with h = S and P in (155) and (156) respectively. The scalar contribution\nis positive definite and the pseudoscalar contribution is negative definite. In the large mass\nlimit (r \u226a 1) we have\naS\u00b5 =\ng2S\n8\u03c02\nr\n[\nln\n1\nr\n\u2212 7\n6\n+O(r)\n]\n, (157)\naP\u00b5 =\ng2P\n8\u03c02\nr\n[\n\u2212 ln 1\nr\n+\n11\n6\n+O(r)\n]\n. (158)\nFurther, in the parity-doublet limit of gS = gP and mS = mP , the leading terms cancel [143]\nand only a tiny positive contribution remains. The effective couplings in (154) can be extracted\nfrom the leptonic widths\n\u0393(h\u2192 \u00b5+\u00b5\u2212) = g\n2\nh\n8\u03c0\nmh\n(\n1\u2212 4m\n2\n\u00b5\nm2h\n)n\/2\n, (159)\nwhere n = 3, 1 for h = S, P respectively.\nLet us estimate the pseudoscalar \u03c00 contribution. We use\n\u0393(\u03c00 \u2192 e+e\u2212) \u2243 5\u00d7 10\u22127 eV. (160)\nAfter we allow for the helicity suppression factor of me\/m\u00b5 for the \u03c0\n0ee coupling, this gives a\n\u03c00\u00b5\u00b5 coupling\ng2pi\n8\u03c0\n\u2243\n(\nm\u00b5\nme\n)2 \u0393(\u03c00 \u2192 e+e\u2212)\nmpi\n\u2243 1.6\u00d7 10\u221210 (161)\n50\nand hence, from (156), a contribution\napi\n0\n\u00b5 \u2243 \u22126\u00d7 10\u221211. (162)\nAlthough this contribution is not completely negligible, we expect a form factor suppression\nof the effective couplings and so the pion structure effects should suppress the magnitude\nsignificantly.\nIn the scalar sector, we do not find a particle with significant leptonic width. Although the\n\u03c3 leptonic width is unknown, we find no reason to expect that its coupling is bigger than the\n\u03b7\u00b5\u00b5 coupling. If we use\ng2\u03c3\n8\u03c0\n\u2243 g\n2\n\u03b7\n8\u03c0\n=\n\u0393(\u03b7 \u2192 \u00b5+\u00b5\u2212)\nm\u03b7\n\u221a\n1\u2212 4m2\u00b5\/m2\u03b7\n\u2243 1.4\u00d7 10\u221211 (163)\nwe find that \u0393(\u03c3 \u2192 \u00b5+\u00b5\u2212) \u2243 7\u00d7 10\u22123eV, and hence\na\u03c3\u00b5 = 7\u00d7 10\u221213 (164)\nfor m\u03c3 = 600 MeV. Again we should expect form-factor suppressions. Because pseudoscalar\nmesons are lighter than the scalars, there is a tendency that the total contribution is negative\nrather than positive.\n6.2 Internal lepton or quark contributions\nThe internal light-by-light scattering contributions in the 4-loop order have been evaluated in\nQED.

(166)\nThe \u00b5-loop contributions to the electron anomalous moment has also been estimated [145]\naint. l-b-le (\u00b5-loop) = \u22120.000184(14)\n(\n\u03b1\n\u03c0\n)4\n. (167)\nIf we interpolate between (166) and (167) by assuming the form (m2\u00b5\/m\n2\nl )[A ln(m\n2\nl \/m\n2\n\u00b5) + B],\nwe obtain the estimate\naint. l-b-l\u00b5 (l-loop) \u2243 \u2212\n[\n0.65 ln\nm2l\nm2\u00b5\n+ 1\n]\nm2\u00b5\nm2l\n(\n\u03b1\n\u03c0\n)4\n, (168)\nwhich may be valid for an arbitrary lepton mass in the range m\u00b5 < ml < m\n2\n\u00b5\/me \u223c 20 GeV.\nFor a \u03c4 -loop internal light-by-light contribution to a\u00b5, the relation (168) gives\naint. l-b-l\u00b5 (\u03c4 -loop) = \u22120.0165\n(\n\u03b1\n\u03c0\n)4\n, (169)\n51\nwhich agrees with the actual numerical result\naint. l-b-l\u00b5 (\u03c4 -loop) = \u22120.01570(49)\n(\n\u03b1\n\u03c0\n)4\n(170)\nwithin 10%.

For mq = 300 MeV, (171) gives\naint. l-b-l\u00b5 (u, d, s-loop) \u2243 \u22126\u00d7 10\u221212. (172)\n6.3 Quark loop estimates of the hadronic light-by-light contribu-\ntions\nIf the same massive quark loop estimate is made for the 3-loop (external) hadronic light-by-light\nscattering contribution, it is found that [146]\naext. l-b-l\u00b5 (u, d, s-loop) \u2243\n2\n3\n\u00d7 0.615\n(\nm\u00b5\nmq\n)2 (\n\u03b1\n\u03c0\n)3\n\u2243 6\u00d7 10\u221210. (173)\nAs we shall see later, this estimate is in reasonably good agreement with the present estimate\nof the total contribution of (8\u00b1 4)\u00d7 10\u221210 of (192), and of its sign.\nThe above well-known result has been regarded as an accident, because in the small quark\nmass limit the quark-loop contribution to the external light-by-light amplitude diverges. The\nlight-meson contributions could only be estimated by adopting the effective light-meson de-\nscription of low-energy QCD. Although the same may well apply for the internal light-by-light\namplitudes, we note here that the quark-loop contributions to the internal light-by-light ampli-\ntudes remain finite in the massless quark limit because of the cancellation of mass singularities\n[147, 148]. We find no strong reason to discredit the order of magnitude estimate based on\n(172) against the successful one of (173) for the external light-by-light amplitudes. Although\nthe point-like \u03c0 contribution of (162) is a factor of ten larger than the estimate (172), the cor-\nresponding point-like \u03c0 contribution to the external light-by-light amplitudes diverges. We can\nexpect that the form factor suppression of the effective vertices should significantly reduce its\ncontribution. Also, since these mesons are lighter than the scalar mesons, we expect the sign of\nthe total meson contribution to be negative, in agreement with the quark loop estimate of (172).\nIn conclusion, we use (172) to estimate that the hadronic internal light-by-light contribution is\ngiven by\naint. l-b-l\u00b5 (hadrons) = \u2212(0.6\u00b1 0.6)\u00d7 10\u221211, (174)\nwhich is totally negligible. We do not take this contribution into account in our final results.\n52\n7 Calculation of ahad\u00b5 and g \u2212 2 of the muon\n7.1 Results on ahad,LO\u00b5\nWe calculated the LO hadronic contribution ahad,LO\u00b5 in Section 3. We found\nahad,LO\u00b5 = (692.4\u00b1 5.9exp \u00b1 1.4rad,VP \u00b1 1.9rad,FSR)\u00d7 10\u221210 (175)\n= (692.4\u00b1 5.9exp \u00b1 2.4rad)\u00d7 10\u221210, (176)\nwhere the first error comes from the systematic and statistic errors in the hadronic data which\nwe included in the clustering algorithm, and the second error is from the uncertainties in the\nradiative correction in the experimental data. Below we explain this in more detail.\nWe add the VP error from the experiments and the narrow resonances linearly. Out of\n1.4 \u00d7 10\u221210, 1.2\u00d7 10\u221210 is from the data, and 0.2\u00d7 10\u221210 is from the narrow resonances. For\nthe errors from the final state radiation we assign 1.9\u00d7 10\u221210, which is the sum of the errors,\n\u03b4afsr,pi\n+pi\u2212\n\u00b5 = 0.68 \u00d7 10\u221210, \u03b4afsr,K+K\u2212\u00b5 = 0.42 \u00d7 10\u221210 and \u03b4afsr, other excl.\u00b5 = 0.81 \u00d7 10\u221210. We\nadded the errors from the VP and the FSR in quadrature, which is the second error in (176).\n7.2 Calculation of the NLO hadronic contributions to g \u2212 2 of the\nmuon\nIn this subsection we update the computation of the NLO hadronic contribution to g\u22122 of the\nmuon. It proceeds in a similar way to that for the LO contribution, but now the kernel of the\ndispersion relation is a little more complicated. There are three types of NLO contributions,\nwhich were denoted (2a), (2b) and (2c) by Krause [149]: (2a) consists of the diagrams which\ncontain one hadronic bubble and which do not involve leptons other than the muon, (2b) is\nthe diagram which has one hadronic bubble and one electron (or tau) loop, and, finally, (2c) is\nthe diagram which has two hadronic bubbles. The three different classes of NLO contributions\ncorrespond to the diagrams which are denoted (a,b,c) respectively in Fig. 23.\nThe contributions from (2a), (2b), and (2c) can be written as\nahad,NLO(2a)\u00b5 =\n\u03b1\n4\u03c04\n\u222b \u221e\nsth\nds \u03c30had(s)K\n(2a)(s), (177)\nahad,NLO(2b)\u00b5 =\n\u03b1\n4\u03c04\n\u222b \u221e\nsth\nds \u03c30had(s)K\n(2b)(s), (178)\nahad,NLO(2c)\u00b5 =\n1\n16\u03c05\u03b1\n\u222b \u221e\nsth\nds\n\u222b \u221e\nsth\nds\u2032 \u03c30had(s)\u03c3\n0\nhad(s\n\u2032)K(2c)(s, s\u2032), (179)\nwhere the analytic expressions for K(2a), K(2b) and K(2c) are given in Ref. [149]. We use the\nclustered data for the cross section for e+e\u2212 \u2192 hadrons, \u03c30had of (2), with the choice of inclusive\ndata in the regime above 1.43 GeV to compute the contributions of the three different classes\nof NLO diagrams. We find\nahad,NLO(2a)\u00b5 = (\u221220.73\u00b1 0.18exp \u00b1 0.07rad)\u00d7 10\u221210, (180)\nahad,NLO(2b)\u00b5 = (10.60\u00b1 0.09exp \u00b1 0.04rad)\u00d7 10\u221210, (181)\nahad,NLO(2c)\u00b5 = (0.34\u00b1 0.01exp \u00b1 0.00rad)\u00d7 10\u221210, (182)\n53\nhad.\n(a)\n\u00b5\n\u00b5 had.\u00b5\n\u03b3\nhad.\n\u00b5\nhad.\u00b5\n\u03b3\n\u00b5\n\u03b3had.\nhad.f\n(b)\n\u00b5\nhad.had.\n(c)\n\u00b5\nFigure 23: The three classes of diagrams (a,b,c) which contribute to ahad,NLO\u00b5 . Class (a) contains\nthe first five diagrams. In the class (b) diagram, f = e or \u03c4 , but not \u00b5. Mirror counterparts\nand diagrams with an interchange between the massless photon and the \u201cmassive photon\u201d\npropagators should be understood.\nwhere we have assigned the uncertainty from the radiative correction similarly to the LO\nhadronic contribution. When summed,\nahad,NLO\u00b5 = (\u22129.79\u00b1 0.09exp \u00b1 0.03rad)\u00d7 10\u221210, (183)\nwhich may be compared to the original calculation of Krause [149],\nahad,NLO\u00b5 = (\u221221.1(0.5) + 10.7(0.2) + 0.27(0.01))\u00d7 10\u221210 = \u221210.1(0.6)\u00d7 10\u221210.\nIn (183) we added the error linearly with an opposite relative sign since the errors in (2a)\nand (2b) are nearly 100% correlated in the opposite directions. Hence the total error is the\ndifference of the two. In combining the errors we neglected the errors from (2c) since it is\nnegligibly small compared to the other errors.\nNote that the contribution of diagram (2c) does not agree with the result given by Krause,\nwhen account is taken of the small error on this contribution. We have therefore performed two\nchecks of our numerical programme. First we replaced the two hadronic blobs of the diagram\n(2c) with two muon loops, since the contribution from such a diagram is known analytically\n[150] as a part of the QED contribution. It is\na\u00b5(two muon loops along one photon propagator)\n=\n(\n\u03b1\n\u03c0\n)3 (\n\u2212943\n324\n\u2212 8\n45\n\u03b6(2) +\n8\n3\n\u03b6(3)\n)\n(184)\n54\n=\n(\n\u03b1\n\u03c0\n)3\n\u00d7 0.002558 . . . (185)\n= 0.3206 . . .\u00d7 10\u221210. (186)\nOur programme reproduced 0.321\u00d710\u221210, which agrees with (186) within an accuracy of 10\u221212,\nwhich is the accuracy of the calculation throughout this paper.\nAs a second check, we have taken R(s) to be a step function. In the first line of Eq. (13)\nof the paper by Krause, the contribution from the diagram (2c) is written as a triple integral\nover s, s\u2032 and x, where s and s\u2032 are \u201dmass-squared\u201d of the hadronic blobs, and x is a Feynman\nparameter. By explicitly integrating over x, Krause obtained the second line of Eq. (13), which\nis a double integral over s and s\u2032. We are using this expression to integrate over the hadronic\ndata. If R(s) is a constant, we can explicitly integrate over s and s\u2032, instead of x. Then we\nare left with one dimensional integral over x, which is much more tractable than the double\nintegral over s and s\u2032. We compared the result obtained from this integral over x with the\ndouble integral over s and s\u2032. Below are the numerical results.\nWhen R(s) is a constant (more rigorously, when R(s) is a step function with R(s) = 1 for\ns > 4m2pi, otherwise R(s) = 0), the result from the double integral is\na\u00b5 = 0.21\u00d7 10\u221210, (187)\n(which has only two significant digits) and the result from the integral over x is\na\u00b5 = 0.2109 . . .\u00d7 10\u221210. (188)\nThe agreement is very good. From the above two checks we believe our result for diagram (2c)\nis correct.\n7.3 Hadronic contribution to g \u2212 2 of the muon\nThe hadronic contribution ahad\u00b5 has been divided into three pieces,\nahad\u00b5 = a\nhad,LO\n\u00b5 + a\nhad,NLO\n\u00b5 + a\nhad,l-b-l\n\u00b5 . (189)\nThe lowest-order (vacuum polarisation) hadronic contribution, ahad,LO\u00b5 , was calculated in Sec-\ntion 3. There we found\nahad,LO\u00b5 = (692.4\u00b1 5.9exp \u00b1 2.4rad)\u00d7 10\u221210, (190)\nwhere we have used the QCD sum rule analysis to resolve the discrepancy in favour of the\ninclusive e+e\u2212 \u2192 hadrons data in the region 1.4 <\u223c\n\u221a\ns <\u223c 2 GeV. The value of the next-to-\nleading order hadronic contribution, ahad,NLO\u00b5 , was updated by the calculation described in the\nprevious subsection. We obtained\nahad,NLO\u00b5 = (\u22129.79\u00b1 0.09exp \u00b1 0.03rad)\u00d7 10\u221210. (191)\n55\nFinally, we must include the hadronic light-by-light scattering contribution ahad,l-b-l\u00b5 . It has\nattracted much study. Recent re-evaluations can be found, for example, in Refs. [151]\u2013[156].\nHere we take the representative value22\nahad,l-b-l\u00b5 = (8.0\u00b1 4.0)\u00d7 10\u221210, (192)\nas given in Ref. [157]. From Eqs. (176), (191) and (192), we can see that ahad,LO\u00b5 has the largest\nuncertainty, although the uncertainty in the light-by-light contribution ahad,l-b-l\u00b5 is also large.\nWhen we combine all the three contributions to the hadronic contribution, we find\nahad\u00b5 = (690.6\u00b1 7.4)\u00d7 10\u221210. (193)\nTo calculate the number above, we first added the uncertainties associated with the LO and\nNLO diagrams linearly, and then added the uncertainty in the light-by-light contribution\nquadratically. We did so since the errors in the LO and the NLO contributions are nearly\n100% correlated.\n7.4 SM prediction of g \u2212 2 of the muon\nThe SM value of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, a\u00b5, may be written as the sum\nof three terms,\naSM\u00b5 = a\nQED\n\u00b5 + a\nEW\n\u00b5 + a\nhad\n\u00b5 . (194)\nThe QED contribution, aQED\u00b5 , has been calculated up to and including estimates of the 5-loop\ncontribution, see reviews [144, 158, 159, 160],\naQED\u00b5 = 116 584 703.5(2.8)\u00d7 10\u221211. (195)\nThis value [160] includes the recent update from [144]. In comparison with the experimental\nerror in Eq. (1), and the error of the hadronic contribution, the uncertainty in aQED\u00b5 is much\nless important than the other sources of uncertainty. The electroweak contribution aEW\u00b5 is\ncalculated through second order to be [161]\u2013[164]\naEW\u00b5 = 154(2)\u00d7 10\u221211. (196)\nHere we quote the result of [164]. Although some discrepancies on conceptual questions remain,\nthis result agrees numerically with the one of [163], and here again the error is negligibly small.\nSumming up the SM contributions to aSM\u00b5 , as given in (193), (195) and (196), we conclude\nthat\naSM\u00b5 = (11659176.3\u00b1 7.4)\u00d7 10\u221210, (197)\nwhich is 26.7 \u00d7 10\u221210 (2.4\u03c3) below the world average experimental measurement. If, on the\nother hand, we were to take, instead of (190), the value of ahad,LO\u00b5 obtained using the sum of\nthe exclusive data in the interval 1.43 <\n\u221a\ns < 2 GeV, then we would find aSM\u00b5 = (11659180.1\u00b1\n7.4) \u00d7 10\u221210, which is 22.9 \u00d7 10\u221210 (2.1\u03c3) below aexp\u00b5 . The above values of aSM\u00b5 is compared\nwith other determinations in Fig. 24.\n22However, see the note added in proof.\n56\n160 170 180 190 200 210\na\u00b5\nSM\n \u00d7 1010 \u2013 11659000\nDEHZ (03) (\u03c4)\nDEHZ (02) (e+e\u2013)\nHMNT (02) (excl.)\nHMNT (02) (incl.)\nJegerlehner (02)\nNew CMD-2 pi+pi\u2013 re-analysed data\nJegerlehner (03)\nDEHZ (03) (\u03c4)\nDEHZ (03) (e+e\u2013)\nHMNT (03) (incl.)\nFigure 24: Recent evaluations of aSM\u00b5 and the current world-average of the measured value\n(shown as a band).

The final values, HMNT(03), are\nthe predictions of this work, and include the recently re-analysed CMD-2 \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 data [10] in our\nanalyses.\n8 Determination of \u03b1QED(M\n2\nZ)\nAs mentioned in the Introduction, the value of the QED coupling at the Z boson mass is\nthe least well known of the three input parameters (G\u00b5, MZ and \u03b1(M\n2\nZ)) which are the three\nmost fundamental inputs of the standard electroweak model. Its uncertainty is therefore the\nlimiting factor for precision electroweak physics. It is clearly important to determine \u03b1(M2Z) as\naccurately as possible.\nThe value of \u03b1(M2Z) is obtained from [104]\n\u03b1\u22121 \u2261 \u03b1(0)\u22121 = 137.03599976(50) (198)\nusing the relation\n\u03b1(s)\u22121 =\n(\n1\u2212\u2206\u03b1lep(s)\u2212\u2206\u03b1(5)had(s)\u2212\u2206\u03b1top(s)\n)\n\u03b1\u22121, (199)\nwhere the leptonic contribution to the running of \u03b1 is known to three loops [169],\n\u2206\u03b1lep(M\n2\nZ) = 0.03149769. (200)\nThe evaluation of the hadronic contribution, \u2206\u03b1\n(5)\nhad(M\n2\nZ), is described below.\n57\n8.1 The hadronic contribution to the running of \u03b1 up to s =M2Z\nIt is conventional to determine the contribution from 5 quark flavours, \u2206\u03b1\n(5)\nhad, and to include\nthe contribution of the sixth flavour [170],\n\u2206\u03b1top(M2Z) = \u22120.000070(05), (201)\nat the end. The quark contribution cannot be calculated just from perturbative QCD because\nof low energy strong interaction effects. Rather we determined the contribution, \u2206\u03b1\n(5)\nhad(M\n2\nZ),\nby evaluating the dispersion relation (46). The results were shown in Table 7. We found\n\u2206\u03b1\n(5)\nhad(M\n2\nZ) = 0.02755\u00b1 0.00019exp \u00b1 0.00013rad,VP \u00b1 0.000019rad,FSR (202)\n= 0.02755\u00b1 0.00019exp \u00b1 0.00013rad (203)\n= 0.02755\u00b1 0.00023, (204)\nif we use the inclusive measurements of R(s) in the interval 1.43 <\n\u221a\ns < 2 GeV. The corre-\nsponding value of the QED coupling is given by\n\u03b1(M2Z)\n\u22121 = 128.954\u00b1 0.031. (205)\nIf, on the other hand, we were to use the sum of the exclusive data for the various e+e\u2212 \u2192 hadron\nchannels, then the result would become 0.02769 \u00b1 0.00018exp \u00b1 0.00013rad and \u03b1(M2Z)\u22121 =\n128.935 \u00b1 0.030. Table 7 shows the contributions to \u2206\u03b1(5)had(M2Z) from the different energy\nintervals of the dispersion integral, (46), together with the sum. An alternative view may be\nobtained from the (lower) pie diagrams of Fig. 18. They display the fractions of the total\ncontribution and error coming from various energy intervals in the dispersion integral. As\nanticipated, both Table 7 and the pie diagrams, show that the hadronic contributions to \u03b1(M2Z)\nare more weighted to higher s values in the dispersion integral for \u2206\u03b1\n(5)\nhad(M\n2\nZ), than those in\nthe integral for ahad\u00b5 needed to predict g \u2212 2 of the muon.\nThe above values of \u2206\u03b1\n(5)\nhad(M\n2\nZ), and the corresponding values of \u03b1\n\u22121 at s = M2Z , are\ncompared with other determinations in Fig. 25. The BES data [89] became available for the\nanalyses from [133] onwards. In Table 10 we compare contributions to the dispersion relation (5)\nfor \u2206\u03b1\n(5)\nhad(M\n2\nZ) obtained in this work with those found by Burkhardt and Pietrzyk [100]. Since\nnew e+e\u2212 data became available for the former analysis, the comparison is only meaningful in\nthe higher energy intervals. Nevertheless, although the agreement in the size of the contributions\nis good, we see that the latter analysis has considerably larger uncertainties in some energy\nintervals, which explains, in part, the difference in the size of the overall error shown in Fig. 25.\n8.2 Implications for the global fit to electroweak data\nThe value of the QED coupling on the Z pole is an important ingredient in the global fit of all\nthe precise electroweak data. The continuous curve in Fig. 26 shows the \u03c72 profile as a function\nof lnmH obtained in the global analysis if our value of \u2206\u03b1had is used.

We thank Martin Gru\u00a8newald for\nmaking this plot.\nThe measured value of mt has been included in the analysis. When our new determination is\ntaken, the fit predicts that a Standard Model Higgs has a mass\nmH = 102\n+58\n\u221238 GeV (206)\nor mH < 221 GeV at the 95% confidence level.\n9 Conclusions\nThe anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, (g \u2212 2)\/2, and the QED coupling at the Z\nboson mass, \u03b1(M2Z), are two important quantities in particle physics. At present, the accuracy\nof the theoretical predictions is limited by the uncertainty of the hadronic vacuum polarization\ncontributions. Here we use all the available data on e+e\u2212 \u2192 hadrons to achieve the best\npresently possible data-driven determination of these contributions. In this way, we obtain a\nStandard Model prediction of the muon anomalous magnetic moment of\naSM\u00b5 = 0.00116591763(74), (207)\nto be compared with the present experimental value of\naexp\u00b5 = 0.0011659203(8), (208)\nwhich shows a 2.4\u03c3 difference. As this comparison of the measurement and prediction becomes\nmore and more precise, we will obtain an increasingly powerful constraint on physics beyond\nthe Standard Model.\n60\nWe have also used our optimal compilation of the available e+e\u2212 \u2192 hadrons data to predict\n\u03b1(M2Z)\n\u22121 = 128.954\u00b1 0.031. (209)\nThe accuracy is now 24 \u00d7 10\u22125. This again is an important quantity. It is the most poorly-\ndetermined of the three parameters which specify the electroweak model. Although significantly\nimproved from the error of Burkhardt and Pietrzyk\u2019s preliminary result [172], it is still the\nleast accurately determined of the three fundamental parameters of the electroweak theory;\n\u2206G\u00b5\/G\u00b5 = 1\u00d7 10\u22125 and \u2206MZ\/MZ = 2\u00d7 10\u22125.\n9.1 Future prospects for reducing the error on g \u2212 2\nWe have stressed that the comparison of the measurement and the Standard Model prediction\nof the muon anomalous magnetic moment, a\u00b5 \u2261 (g\u00b5 \u2212 2)\/2, is very important. It provides a\nvaluable constraint on, or an indicator of, new physics beyond the Standard Model. From the\nabove discussion, we see that the present uncertainties on the measurement and the prediction\nare 8 and 7 \u00d710\u221210 respectively. How realistic is it to improve the accuracy in the future? On\nthe experimental side, the accuracy is dominated at present by the BNL measurement. We\ncan expect a further improvement in the BNL measurement of (g \u2212 2), since the collaboration\nare at present analysing 3.7 billion \u00b5\u2212 events which should give a total relative error of about\n0.8 ppm. As a consequence, the \u00b18\u00d710\u221210 uncertainty in (208) should be improved23 to about\n\u00b16 \u00d7 10\u221210. If the error on the theory prediction can be improved beyond this value then the\ncase for another dedicated experiment with even more precision is considerably enhanced.\nThe error attributed to the theoretical prediction of a\u00b5 is dominated by the uncertainties in\nthe computation of the hadronic contribution, ahad\u00b5 ; in particular on the calculation of a\nhad,LO\n\u00b5\nand ahad,l-b-l\u00b5 , which at present have uncertainties of about 6 and 4 \u00d710\u221210 respectively. The\nlatter error, on the light-by-light contribution, is generally believed to be able to be improved\nto 2 \u00d710\u221210 (25% error); and, optimistically, it is perhaps not hopeless to envisage an even-\ntual accuracy of about 1 \u00d710\u221210 (10% error), but this would require a breakthrough in the\nunderstanding of this contribution. We are left to consider how much the error on ahad,LO\u00b5 could\nbe improved. Already we are claiming a 1% accuracy. To reduce the error from the present\n6 \u00d710\u221210 to 1 \u00d710\u221210 is not realistic. However we should note (see, for example, Ref. [173])\nthere will be progress from all experiments that are measuring R. Indeed, with the improve-\nments, already in progress or planned, of the BES, CMD-3 + SND at VEPP-2000, BaBar,\nBelle, CLEO-C and KLOE experiments, we may anticipate an eventual accuracy of 0.5% in the\ncrucial \u03c1 domain and 1-2% in the region above 1 GeV. It will be challenging, but not impossible.\nThis statement also applies to improving the accuracy of the radiative corrections.\nIn this connection, note that the measurements of the radiative return experiments are\njust becoming available. From these experiments we may anticipate low energy data for a\nvariety of e+e\u2212 channels, produced via initial state radiation, at the \u03c6-factory DA\u03a6NE [6, 9]\nand at the B-factories, BaBar and Belle, see, for example, [174]. For instance, by detecting\nthe \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212\u03b3 channel, it may be possible to measure the vital e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 cross section in\n23See the note added in proof.\n61\nthe threshold region. For the radiative return experiments there is no problem with statistics,\nand the accuracy is at present due to systematics, which come mainly from theory. These new\nexperiments are motivating much theoretical work to improve their accuracy. Already, today,\nit is claimed to be 2% in the \u03c1 region.\nIn summary, we may hope for an improvement in accuracy down to about 3 \u00d710\u221210 in the\ntheoretical prediction of a\u00b5 in the foreseeable future, which in turn emphasizes the need for an\nexperimental measurement with improved precision.\nNote added in proof\nThe BNL muon g \u2212 2 collaboration have just published [178] the results of their analysis\nof the \u00b5\u2212 data which updates their experimental determination of a\u00b5. As a result they now\nobtain a new world average\naexp\u00b5 = 0.0011659208(6) . (210)\nComparing this value with our SM prediction of Eq. (207) we find a 3.3\u03c3 discrepancy, as\nshown by the HMNT (03) (incl.) error bar in Fig. 27. That is the discrepancy is \u03b4a\u00b5 =\n(31.7\u00b1 9.5)\u00d7 10\u221210.\nAlso, very recently, the hadronic light-by-light contribution has been recalculated, paying\nparticular attention to the matching between the short- and long-distance behaviour [179]. The\ncontribution is found to be ahad,l-b-l\u00b5 = (13.6\u00b1 2.5)\u00d7 10\u221210. In addition Kinoshita and Nio have\nupdated the calculation of the \u03b14 QED contribution and find [180]\naQED\u00b5 = 116584719.35(1.43)\u00d7 10\u221211, (211)\nwhich should be compared with the value (195) we have used. If we use these new ahad,l\u2212b\u2212l\u00b5\nand aQED\u00b5 values, then our prediction is given by the HMNT (03b) (incl.) error bar in Fig. 27,\nand corresponds to\naSM\u00b5 = (11659183.53\u00b1 6.73)\u00d7 10\u221210 (212)\nin the place of Eq. (207). If this prediction is compared with the new BNL result above, then\nthere is a discrepancy of 2.7\u03c3, that is \u03b4a\u00b5 = (24.5\u00b1 9.0)\u00d7 10\u221210.\n62\n180 190 200 210\na\u00b5\nSM\n \u00d7 1010 \u2013 11659000\nSM prediction\nHMNT (03) (incl.)\nHMNT (03b) (incl.)\nExperiment\nprev. world avg.

The cP coefficients are cpi0 = 1 and c\u03b78 = 1\/\n\u221a\n3. We may extend the\nmultiplet to include the SU(3) singlet, \u03b71, for which the coefficient is c\u03b71 = 2\n\u221a\n2\/\n\u221a\n3. As usual,\nF\u00b5\u03bd is the QED field strength tensor, and F\u02dc\u00b5\u03bd is its dual,\nF\u02dc\u00b5\u03bd \u2261 \u01eb\u00b5\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3F \u03c1\u03c3, (214)\nwhere \u01eb\u00b5\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 is a totally antisymmetric tensor with \u01eb0123 = 1.\n63\nA.1: \u03c00 \u2192 2\u03b3 decay and e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c00\u03b3\nThe WZW interaction, (213), is responsible for the \u03c00 \u2192 2\u03b3 decay. The lowest-order amplitude\nM is\nM = \u03b1\n\u03c0fpi\n\u01eb\u00b5\u03bd\u03bb\u03c3 p1\u00b5 p2\u03bb \u01eb\n\u2217\n\u03bd(p1) \u01eb\n\u2217\n\u03c3(p2), (215)\nwhich results in the partial decay width\n\u0393(\u03c00 \u2192 2\u03b3) = \u03b1\n2m3pi0\n64\u03c03f 2pi\n, (216)\nwhen summed over the polarization of the final state photons. If we take fpi = (130 \u00b1 5)\/\n\u221a\n2\nMeV and mpi0 = 134.9766\u00b1 0.0006 MeV [104], then this gives\n\u0393(\u03c00 \u2192 2\u03b3) = 7.81\u00b1 0.60 eV, (217)\nwhich is in good agreement with the experimental value [104],\n\u0393(\u03c00 \u2192 2\u03b3)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\nexp.\n= 7.7\u00b1 0.6 eV. (218)\nThe cross section of e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c00\u03b3 can be written in terms of the \u03c00 \u2192 2\u03b3 width as\n\u03c3(e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c00\u03b3) = \u03c3pt(e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c00\u03b3) \u2261 8\u03b1\u03c0\u0393(\u03c0\n0 \u2192 2\u03b3)\n3m3pi\n(\n1\u2212 m\n2\npi\ns\n)3\n. (219)\nWe can further improve the behaviour of the cross section by assuming vector meson dominance:\n\u03c3VMD(e\n+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c00\u03b3) = \u03c3pt(e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c00\u03b3)\n(\nm2\u03c9\nm2\u03c9 \u2212 s\n)2\n. (220)\nWe use the equation above in calculating the \u03c00\u03b3 contribution from the threshold region in\nSection 3.1.\nA.2: \u03b7 \u2192 2\u03b3 decay and e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03b7\u03b3\nIf we neglect \u03b78-\u03b71 mixing and identify \u03b78 as \u03b7, then the \u03b7 \u2192 2\u03b3 decay is dictated by the WZW\ninteraction,\nLWZW = \u2212 \u03b1\n8\n\u221a\n3\u03c0fpi\n\u03b78 F\u00b5\u03bdF\u02dc\n\u00b5\u03bd , (221)\nwhich contains an extra factor of 1\/\n\u221a\n3 as compared with the \u03c00\u03b3\u03b3 coupling term. The calcu-\nlation of the decay rate is exactly analogous to that of \u03c00 decay. The result is\n\u0393(\u03b7 \u2192 2\u03b3) = \u03b1\n2m3\u03b7\n192\u03c03f 2pi\n(LO ChPT without \u03b71-\u03b78 mixing). (222)\nTaking fpi = (130\u00b1 5)\/\n\u221a\n2 MeV and m\u03b7 = 547.30\u00b1 0.12 MeV [104], we obtain\n\u0393(\u03b7 \u2192 2\u03b3) = 0.174\u00b1 0.013 keV (LO ChPT without \u03b71-\u03b78 mixing), (223)\n64\nwhich differs from the observed value [104] by about a factor of 3,\n\u0393(\u03b7 \u2192 2\u03b3)|exp. = 0.46\u00b1 0.04 keV. (224)\nThe agreement becomes better when we allow for the mixing between the \u03b7 and \u03b7\u2032 states.\nFollowing Ref. [175], we define the mixing angle \u03b8P by(\n\u03b7\n\u03b7\u2032\n)\n=\n(\ncos \u03b8P \u2212 sin \u03b8P\nsin \u03b8P cos \u03b8P\n)(\n\u03b78\n\u03b71\n)\n.

(226)\nIf we take \u03b8P \u2248 \u221220\u25e6 [175], then the coefficient of the \u03b7F F\u02dc term is\nc\u03b78 cos \u03b8P \u2212 c\u03b71 sin \u03b8P = 1.91\u00d7 c\u03b78 = 1.10, (227)\nand the predicted decay width is\n\u0393(\u03b7 \u2192 2\u03b3) = \u03b1\n2m3\u03b7\n64\u03c03f 2pi\n(c\u03b78 cos \u03b8P \u2212 c\u03b71 sin \u03b8P )2\n\u2243 0.63 keV (LO ChPT with \u03b71-\u03b78 mixing). (228)\nWe find the residual discrepancy with the observed rate is removed when we introduce the\nhigher-order effect, f1 6= f8 6= fpi.

From the amplitude of (236) we can readily calculate the\nrequired partial decay width\n\u0393(V \u2192 \u03b3\u03c3) = m\n3\nV\n6\u03c0\n(\neg\u03c3\u03b3\u03b3\ngV\n)2 (\n1\u2212 m\n2\n\u03c3\nm2V\n)3\n. (238)\nIf we use the parameters [104]\nm\u03c6 = 1019 MeV, \u0393\u03c6 = 4.26 MeV,\ng2\u03c6\/\u03c0 = 14.4, B(\u03c6\u2192 \u03b3\u03c3) < 0.002, (239)\nand assume m\u03c3 = 600 MeV, then the coupling constant g\u03c3\u03b3\u03b3 is constrained to be\ng\u03c3\u03b3\u03b3 < 5.2\u00d7 10\u22124(MeV\u22121). (240)\n66\nThis bound gives constraints on B(\u03c9 \u2192 \u03c3\u03b3) and B(\u03c6(1.68)\u2192 \u03c3\u03b3). From (238), the branching\nratio B(V \u2192 \u03c3\u03b3) is\nB(V \u2192 \u03c3\u03b3) = 2\u03b1m\n3\nV\n3\u0393V\n(\n1\u2212 m\n2\n\u03c3\nm2V\n)3 g2\u03c3\u03b3\u03b3\ng2V\n. (241)\nFor the \u03c9 decay, we use the parameters\nm\u03c9 = 783 MeV, \u0393\u03c9 = 8.44 MeV, g\n2\n\u03c9\/\u03c0 = 23.2, m\u03c3 = 600 MeV, (242)\nto obtain the constraint\nB(\u03c9 \u2192 \u03c3\u03b3) < 7.2\u00d7 10\u22125. (243)\nSimilarly, for the \u03c6(1.68)\u2192 \u03c3\u03b3 decay, we have\nB(\u03c6(1.68)\u2192 \u03c3\u03b3) < 3.5\u00d7 10\u22125, (244)\nusing the parameters\nm\u03c6(1.68) = 1680 MeV, \u0393\u03c6(1.68) = 150 MeV, g\n2\n\u03c6(1.68)\/\u03c0 = 249, m\u03c3 = 600 MeV. (245)\nThese constraints are used in Section 5.2.\n67\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Simon Eidelman for numerous helpful discussions concerning the data. We also\nthank M. Fukugita, M.
