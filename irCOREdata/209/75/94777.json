ABSTRACT In the new South Africa, the promise of land restitution raised millennial-style expectations amongst dispossessed and dispersed former landholders. PartlyMarch 2, 2009 Time: 02:30pm afr070.tex CONTESTING LAND CLAIMS IN MPUMALANGA 251 prompted by emerging policy discourses, iconic tropes of localized cultural experience such as grave sites, initiation lodges and cattle byres acquired new signi\ufb01cance. Because they proved what the Land Claims Commission calls \u2018informal rights\u2019 to land, they became veri\ufb01able evidence of effective possession, and thus grounds on which to claim the restoration of such land. The meaning of land, the nature of ownership and the legitimacy of its restoration were all matters contested between claimants, policy makers and human rights lawyers. They were also contested by those at different levels in the hierarchical social order of the new South Africa. Members of the African nationalist political elite, in dialogue with lawyers, cherished one set of understandings, while ordinary migrant\/country-dwellers tended to hold to another. Both, however, were mediated through the new discourse on informal rights. It is neither purely through the activities of cosmopolitan elites with their \u2018political demand for land\u2019 nor through the unmediated localist experience of less sophisticated country-dwellers with more practical orientations that the signi\ufb01cance of land becomes evident, but in the interaction between the two. Based on local understandings, transformed in the course of thirty years of \u2018land back\u2019 struggles, and \ufb01nally negotiated over the course of the last ten years, a new diasporic consensus on what \u2018the land\u2019 signi\ufb01es has been established. R\u00c9SUM\u00c9 Dans la nouvelle Afrique du Sud, la promesse d\u2019une restitution des terres a suscit\u00e9 des attentes de style mill\u00e9naire parmi les d\u00e9poss\u00e9d\u00e9s et les anciens propri\u00e9taires terriens dispers\u00e9s. Pouss\u00e9s en partie par des discours de politique \u00e9mergents, des tropes iconiques d\u2019exp\u00e9rience culturelle localis\u00e9e comme les lieux d\u2019inhumation, loges d\u2019initiation et \u00e9tables ont acquis une nouvelle signi\ufb01cation. Parce qu\u2019ils ont prouv\u00e9 ce que la commission charg\u00e9e d\u2019examiner les demandes de restitution de terres appelle des \u00abdroits informels\u00bb, ils sont devenus des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve v\u00e9ri\ufb01ables de possession effective, et par cons\u00e9quent des motifs de revendication de restitution de ces terres. Parmi les sujets de contestation soulev\u00e9s par les demandeurs, d\u00e9cideurs et avocats sp\u00e9-cialistes des droits de l\u2019homme \ufb01guraient la signi\ufb01cation de la terre, la nature de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et la l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 de sa restitution. Autant de sujets \u00e9galement contest\u00e9s \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents niveaux de l\u2019ordre social hi\u00e9rarchique de la nouvelle Afrique du Sud. Les membres de l\u2019\u00e9lite politique nationaliste africaine, en dialogue avec des juristes, affectionnaient un corps d\u2019interpr\u00e9tations, tandis que les migrants\/ruraux ordinaires avaient tendance \u00e0 se r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 un autre. Tous deux, cependant, passaient par le nouveau discours sur les droits informels. Ce n\u2019est ni dans les activit\u00e9s des \u00e9lites cosmopolitaines et leur \u00abrevendication fonci\u00e8re politique\u00bb, ni dans l\u2019exp\u00e9rience localiste sans m\u00e9diation des ruraux moins sophistiqu\u00e9s et leurs orientations plus pratiques, que l\u2019importance de la terre devient manifeste, mais dans l\u2019interaction entre les deux. Fond\u00e9 sur des interpr\u00e9tations locales qui se sont transform\u00e9es au \ufb01l de trente ann\u00e9es de luttes pour le \u00abretour des terres\u00bb, puis n\u00e9goci\u00e9 au cours des dix derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, un nouveau consensus diasporique a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli sur ce que signi\ufb01e \u00abla terre\u00bb.","cites":null},{"id":17278416,"title":"Banking on Change.","authors":[],"date":"2001","doi":null,"raw":"Dolny, H.

Such changes were forward-\nlooking but were premised on the restoration of past property regimes.\nThey prompted millennial expectations which were nurtured by an\nintense interest in the past and a promise of former lives to be regained.\nIn South Africa, politicians standing for office in the first democratic\nelections of 1994 pledged the return of the land from which many\ncountry-dwellers had been alienated during the Apartheid period and\nunder earlier colonial regimes. Getting \u2018land back\u2019 was one of the\nthings \u2018we voted for\u2019. What was at stake in the public imagination was\nnothing less than the complete redrawing of the map of South Africa.\nSome people, who had once owned farms but had them confiscated,\nnow imagined their lands reinstated; others had once lived on white-\nowned farms as tenants and now imagined themselves moving back to\nsupplant the farmers who had long ago evicted them.More ambitiously,\nmembers of new regional elites with links to hereditary chiefs imagined\nthemselves reclaiming entire lost empires. Some spoke with enthusiasm\nof the abundant herds they planned to keep and the gardens and fields\nthey would cultivate on apparently barren ground. Others described the\nshopping centres and casinos they envisaged as springing up on rocky\nhillsides.\nBut this simple image of restorative justice, premised on ideas of\nracialized dispossession, was misleading. The mechanisms of land\naccess, the precise way in which property ought to be held, and most\nimportantly the overarching question \u2018whose land?\u2019 (Murray 1992)\nhave been matters of intense dispute. This is hardly surprising given\nthe complexities and social divisions \u2013 besides those of race \u2013which\ncharacterize South African society. Where the highest-profile episodes\nof land dispossession were the \u2018black spot\u2019 evictions in which former\ntitle holders were violently relocated at a single, relatively recent,\nmoment in time, those episodes least visible to the media involved\ntenants (so-called \u2018squatters\u2019) losing their rights over the course of many\ndecades. The promise of restored property, raising expectations in both\nthese sectors, generated tension and division.\nDEBORAH JAMES is Reader in Anthropology at the London School of Economics.

The former were mostly deployed\nby members of the emergent political elite (many from the former title-\nholder class) and the latter by poorer migrant\/country-dwellers (many\nfrom the tenantry). But to presume a simple equivalence between style\nand class\/social group would be to overlook the processes through\nwhich political expectations come to be enunciated and to take root\nand flourish, even within settings where they did not originate. It would\nalso be to ignore how far political elites\u2019 search for legitimacy leads them\nto phrase cosmopolitan aspirations in localist terms.\nSome among the emerging political elite \u2013 such as politicians in the\nprocess of electioneering \u2013 have generated an intense interest in localist\nrepertoires relating to the land and to \u2018getting the land back\u2019. But such\ndiscourses have spread through the ranks of the civil service and are\nparticularly prevalent amongst those who were appointed to positions\nin the new Land Claims Commission.1 There are two routes through\nwhich these office holders have acquired their own interest in localist\ndiscourses on land. First, they have been entrusted with the duty\nto ascertain precisely who is entitled to acquire land under the new\ndispensation and, in the process, to \u2018verify\u2019 the rights of such people\nthrough a series of procedures which combine evocative explorations of\noriginary cultural landscapes with stifling bureaucratese. Second, many\nof them are drawn from the ranks of those who aspire, themselves,\nto get land back. They thus operate from the standpoint both of\nmediators between the state and other beneficiaries of the process, and\nof direct beneficiaries of the process themselves. The intersection here\nbetween cosmopolitan and localist discourses is thus not simply an\nencounter between opposed cultural styles associated with divergent\nclass backgrounds (Ferguson 1999). It is a set of interpretations\nconverging on the key trope \u2013 or texts \u2013 of land.\nThe article focuses on that aspect of South Africa\u2019s restitution\nprogramme which aims to include claims based on \u2018informal rights\u2019\nalongside those based on the holding of formal title. It uses case\nstudies of a number of claims in Mpumalanga Province, detailing the\ninteraction of Land Claims Commission officers with the intended\nbeneficiaries whose claims for restitution they are responsible for\nfollowing through. Elites, in their intense and not entirely disinterested\ninteractions with ordinary claimants, have engendered a new awareness\nof land restoration amongst such claimants.\nLAND REFORM IN SOUTH AFRICA: A THUMBNAIL SKETCH\nLand reform is seen as being of crucial importance in South Africa.\nAwareness of its implications has been highlighted by the Zimbabwean\nland invasions and the escalation, in South Africa, of savage attacks\n1Also known as the Commission on Restitution of Land Rights.\nMarch 2, 2009 Time: 02:30pm afr070.tex\n230 CONTESTING LAND CLAIMS IN MPUMALANGA\non and murders of white farmers, the vigilantism practised by white\nfarmers against African farm-dwellers, and the recent rise of the\nLandless People\u2019s Movement (LPM) with its links to organizations\nsuch as Brazil\u2019s MST.2 The ANC is aware that the outcomes of\nland reform could have a significant impact on the party\u2019s credibility,\neffectiveness and future support; that it could either exacerbate racial\ntensions, or, handled carefully, defuse these to establish new and fruitful\npartnerships.\nWhat gave land its significance as a symbol of citizenship over\nthe course of the twentieth century was the gradual, but ultimately\nsystematic, exclusion of Africans from the right to own it. Mamdani\u2019s\ninfluential account, according to which a system of customary land\ntenure in separate \u2018ethnic\u2019 territories made rural Africans politically\ndependent upon chiefs (1996: 21\u20132; see also Ashforth 1990: 158),\nfails to acknowledge the uneven and disputed character of African land\noccupation over the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries\n(Delius and Cope 2007; Mulaudzi and Schirmer 2007: 353\u20134), and\nthus overemphasizes the monolithic character of Apartheid\u2019s project.\nBut it is nonetheless accurate to say that, overall, the Apartheid state\nboth created an inexorably divided sense of territory and in the process\ndenied citizenship or assigned it on a second-class basis. Undoing\nApartheid thus required that a unity of territory and government be\ncreated where previously there had been division.\nSince space and territory had been of key importance in Apartheid\u2019s\nplans, resistance to the implementation of these plans was likewise\nspatial and territorial in character (Bozzoli 2004). Land and rights\nbecame indissolubly connected in the public mind, partly because of\nclashes \u2013 increasingly fierce towards the end of the 1980s \u2013 between the\nstate and the people whose property, land and citizenship rights it\nwas undermining (Delius 1996; Seekings 2000; van Kessel 2000). The\ndrafters of South Africa\u2019s new constitution, seeing land as central in\ndefining the rights that had formerly been denied, proposed to restore\nland rights \u2013 and with them the sovereignty and full citizenship of the\nAfrican population (Ramutsindela 1998).\nWhile LPM members and some politicians signalled support for the\n\u2018fast-track\u2019 approach of Zimbabwe, the South African government was\ndetermined to structure and organize land transfer, carefully designing\npolicies and laws to achieve the ambitious target of transferring\n30 per cent of farm land across the racial frontier.3 Rather than\nexpropriation, the \u2018market\u2019 was proposed as a means to acquire such\nland, which \u2013with the mediation of state officials \u2013would be bought\n2Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais sem Terra. Although the LPM has been extremely\nvociferous, the size of its membership base and the nature of its links to this base have been\ncalled into question (James 2007).\n3Similar strategies had, in fact, been pursued in Zimbabwe in the 1980s (Hoogeveen and\nKinsey 2001; Kinsey 1999). Their lack of success was due not only to matters of livelihood\nbut also to the emergence of a political context which lent itself to land-based patronage rather\nthan to other more democratic alternatives.\nMarch 2, 2009 Time: 02:30pm afr070.tex\nCONTESTING LAND CLAIMS IN MPUMALANGA 231\nfrom \u2018willing sellers\u2019 by \u2018willing buyers\u2019. This approach generated\nmuch criticism (Hall and Williams 2003).\nSeveral branches of the programme were designed: restitution,\nredistribution and tenure reform. The ANC\u2019s \u2018political demand for\nland\u2019 (Dolny 2001: 100) arose from the experience of titled landowners,\nthe group from which much of the emerging African political elite was\ndrawn and which had lost much of its property in \u2018black spot\u2019 forced\nremovals. Restitution based primarily on past entitlement and rights\nwas thus bound to be the guiding principle of South African land\nreform, and the Restitution Act of 1994 was controversially phrased\nso as to render more far-reaching (or more vaguely defined) claims,\nor those which dated from before 1913, illegitimate. The inclusion\nof \u2018informal rights\u2019 as a basis for restitution was, however, intended\nto enable at least some of these claims dating from an earlier period\nto be included. But those Africans who had never had secure \u2013 or\nany \u2013 claims on landed property would not be excluded. The policy\narm known as redistribution would enable them to group together and\npurchase farms with the aid of a government grant. Finally, the rights\nof those residing on land but depending on others for their occupation\nof it \u2013 those continuing to live on white farms, or under chiefs in the\nhomelands \u2013would be assured through tenure reform.\nThis subdivision of the programme acknowledged the differentiated\nnature of \u2018the landless\u2019. Some intended beneficiaries were former\ntitle holders while others \u2013 including the holders of so-called informal\nrights \u2013 belonged to the tenantry (often termed \u2018squatters\u2019). Both were\nleft landless in the Apartheid era, but the latter, who had never\nenjoyed property rights even before it, have gradually come to be seen\nin the advocacy literature as more deserving of the benefits of land\nreform than the former. But the neat subdivisions of the programme\nneither forestalled ideological conflicts between those charged with, or\nbenefiting from, different subdivisions of the programme, nor prevented\nslippage between these two categories. Their blurring was to the\nadvantage both of aspirant farmers with no former land rights who\nattempted to prove spurious connections to it through restitution, and\nof people with a genuine sense of entitlement who, recognizing the\ndifficulties of proof, attempted to benefit from redistribution instead.\nAttempted differentiations \u2013 and blurrings \u2013 have been in evidence\namongst policy makers too. The initial importance of a language\nof rights owed much to human rights lawyers (Abel 1995). But an\nincreasingly predominant line of argument, adopted by the government\nafter the second democratic elections in 1999, foregrounded the\neconomic benefits from securely owning property and using it\nproductively. The two approaches were merged in the early years of\nthe land reform programme, which employed many lawyers and NGO\nofficers. The subsequent shift towards more explicitly liberal economic\npolicies has decoupled the rights-based approach from the property-\nbased\/economic one, favouring the latter. Attempts to promote a\nland-owning, entrepreneurial African farming constituency have thus\neclipsed the previous emphasis on the rights and welfare of the rural\nMarch 2, 2009 Time: 02:30pm afr070.tex\n232 CONTESTING LAND CLAIMS IN MPUMALANGA\nFIGURE 1 South African land reform legislation (Source: \u3008www.info.\ngov.za\/gazette\/acts\u3009; Adams 2000)\npoor (Cousins 2000; Hall and Williams 2003). With this altered\ndirection many former land activists left state employment to rejoin the\nNGO sector, attempting thus to pursue the more egalitarian vision of\nthe programme\u2019s priorities.\nThroughout all these changes, it remains the case that landed\nproperty and citizenship in South Africa are integrally linked. And\nnotwithstanding these shifts of national policy, in regional settings\nthe striving to regain land remains key. Although land is increasingly\nunlikely to form a substantial basis for any kind of economic livelihood\n(James 2007), it continues to symbolize citizenship as well as being seen\nas a material outcome, intended if not yet achieved, of citizens\u2019 exercise\nof their democratic rights. But the exact mechanism of land access, and\nhence the precise way in which property is held, is disputed.\nFROM PAST TO PRESENT: LAND OCCUPANCY AND DISPOSSESSION\nDuring the Christmas vacation of 2001\/2, the South African\nnewspapers reported a shocking event, which brought a formerly\nunknown family to prominence and led to their almost daily mention\nMarch 2, 2009 Time: 02:30pm afr070.tex\nCONTESTING LAND CLAIMS IN MPUMALANGA 233\non the radio. The reports highlighted both how restitution based on\ninformal rights had sharpened expectations of land reform and also how\nthe accompanying expectations were being thwarted by bureaucratic\ndelays. An open truck carrying about fifty members of the Chego\nand related families had been on its way from their present place of\nresidence \u2013 in the former Lebowa homeland (now Limpopo Province)\nat Magukubyane (Figure 2: 9) \u2013 back to gravesites at their original\nhome around Tigerhoek (Figure 2: C) to undertake an ancestral ritual.\nThe truck overturned on a steep mountain pass, causing forty-three\nfatalities. In the furore which followed, the claimants\u2019 misfortunes came\nto symbolize broader problems. The accident became the focus of\na radio advertisement promoting road safety, but it also pushed the\nfamily\u2019s ever-sharpening dissatisfaction about its unresolved land claim\ninto the public gaze, making theirs an emblem of similar frustrations\nnationwide. One of the provincial Land Claims Commissioners,\nspeaking at the funeral, rashly asserted that the Chegos\u2019 claim would\nbe \u2018fast-tracked\u2019 and implied that other, similar claims would likewise\nbe speedily settled.\nThe processes of land dispossession underpinning claims such as\nthese (in the area of Mpumalanga Province, shown in the enlarged\nsquare in Figure 2) had been under way for more than half a century.\nThese, although gradual and almost inexorable for many families, had\nallowed some choice and flexibility for others. It was because of the\nuneven character of this land dispossession that families like the Chegos\ncontinued to have some members living on farms in so-called \u2018white\u2019\nSouth Africa while others had left to live in the former homelands.\nHence the long journeys undertaken to visit burial sites \u2013 and hence the\naccident.\nThe grandparents and great-grandparents of the present Chego\nclaimants had lived a semi-nomadic existence, cultivating and herding\ncattle, on the lands on either side of the river they called Tubatse\nin the area known by the same name. In the wake of Boer and\nBritish conquests in the nineteenth century, lands to the south of the\nriver, termed Steelpoort by the Boer settlers, were surveyed, fenced,\nnamed \u2013Buffelskloof, Luiperdshoek, Standdrift, Tigerhoek, Groothoek\n(around C in Figure 2) \u2013 and allocated to white settler\/farmers (Delius\nand Cope 2007: 142). Despite considerable interruptions to the process\nof land alienation and the development of settler agriculture during\nthe South African War (1899\u20131902), definitively racialized patterns of\nland use were established when government commissions proceeded\nto designate the river as the boundary between white South Africa\nand the \u2018native reserve\u2019 (Schirmer 2007: 295; Mulaudzi and Schirmer\n2007: 356). The African occupants of the land were pressed into\nvarious forms of labour tenancy or, if they paid rent, inaccurately\ntermed \u2018squatters\u2019. These occupants, coming to rely increasingly on\nmigratory wages alongside cultivation, strove to balance the labour\nrequirements of farm owners against those of their employers in the\ncities (ibid.: 361\u20132). Some families, unable to reconcile these demands,\nexperienced increasing displacement as the twentieth century wore on.\nMarch 2, 2009 Time: 02:30pm afr070.tex\n234 CONTESTING LAND CLAIMS IN MPUMALANGA\nFIGURE 2 Map of Mpumalanga, showing relocation and restitution sites\nBy the time the older Chego claimants had grown to adulthood \u2013 in\nthe 1940s and 1950s \u2013 certain white farmers were beginning to insist\nthat tenants reduce the size of their substantial cattle herds, and were\ncomplaining that many of the young men residing on their farms, who\nspent up to six months of the year as migrant workers in Johannesburg,\nwere unavailable to do farm labour. Evicted from these farms under\nthe notorious trek pas system as farmers demanded a greater proportion\nof their time, or as white farming became more capital-intensive and\nMarch 2, 2009 Time: 02:30pm afr070.tex\nCONTESTING LAND CLAIMS IN MPUMALANGA 235\nstarted relying on contract labour, some families had begun to move\naway, resettling on other white-owned farms from which they were then\nevicted in turn, and\/or eventually taking up residence within the African\nreserves (later \u2018homelands\u2019): places of greater residential concentration\nwhere they could gain access to schooling, shops and services. Others,\nhowever, continued to make a living while residing on white-owned\nfarms: often those leased or owned by poorer farmers who had few\nsources of labour for their farming enterprise other than African tenants\n(James 1987; Schirmer 1994,1995).\nThis form of relocation was more gradual than the infamous \u2018black\nspot\u2019 variety. It left members of extended families strung out across\nthe countryside rather than resettling them all at once. Kinsmen from\nneighbouring farms, evicted or hearing about the prospects for a\ndifferent life, moved to new homes in close proximity to one another:\nthus were the Chegos and other families, with long-standing ties of\nmarriage, able to continue these marriage alliances once they had\nmoved. Resettlement was also uneven. Each relocating cluster left\nother branches of the family on the white farms. At the time of\nfieldwork in 2003 there were seven Chego households still living at\ntheir original home, on and around the farm Tigerhoek (Figure 2: C).\nThese remaining families had been included, alongside their diasporic\nrelatives, in the land claim.\nThe continued presence of Chego family members on these white\nfarms made for some continuity in the relationship which their relatives\nin the homeland diaspora had managed to sustain with their lands.\nThe Chegos north of the river had regularly visited their former home\nfor weddings, funerals and ancestral propitiation. The ritual traffic had\nintensified as the promise of restitution began to seem fulfillable. It was\nin the course of such a visit that the terrible accident occurred.\nAbout a year later, during a 2003 meeting of the Chego land claim\ncommittee, my field assistant Mmapaseka Mohale and I were asked to\nhelp in bringing their delayed claim to the attention of the authorities.\nWe talked of the sheer weight of claims in Mpumalanga Province which\nthe Commission, we\u2019d heard, was having to process, especially since\nthe recognition of informal rights had been secured in the wake of a\ndefinitive Land Claims Court judgement in 1999. The Commission\nwas finding it difficult to confirm who had held such rights, and to\nwhich pieces of land.4\nInformal rights, we said, might have presented particular problems in\nthe Chegos\u2019 case. There were counter-claimants to the same farm, and\nproof of absolute ownership was virtually impossible. A member of the\nMadihlaba family \u2013 connected in marriage to the Chegos over several\ngenerations (James 1987) \u2013 had also named Tigerhoek in his claim. The\nCommission\u2019s project officers would be sending out fieldworkers to\naccompany claimants on exploratory walks on the farm, in order to\nconfirm whether families could identify the sites of their cattle kraals\n4Kranspoort 48LS, LCC26\/98, 10 December 1999 (LCC); \u3008http:\/\/wwwserver.law.wits.\nac.za\/lcc\/summary.php?case_id=2468\u3009, consulted 22 September 2004.\nMarch 2, 2009 Time: 02:30pm afr070.tex\n236 CONTESTING LAND CLAIMS IN MPUMALANGA\nand graves. If two rival claimant families were found to have knowledge\nof these key cultural sites, it might be concluded that both had enjoyed\nrights on the same farm: some way would have to be found of sharing\nthe land between them.5 A proposed solution to the problem of rival\nclaims, and of the lack of skilled manpower within the Commission,\nwas to appoint a consultant to attend to claimant verification. But this\nhad not yet been done.\nWe drew the Chegos\u2019 attention to an alternative strategy followed by\na group \u2013 the Masha clan \u2013whose informal rights land claim, centred\non the farm Kalkfontein (Figure 2: E), had been settled two years\npreviously in 2000. Would it not be better to incorporate and unite\nwith rival claimants, as the Mashas had done? Our advice here, while\nhelpful in its intentions, was unintentionally disingenuous, since it\nfailed to acknowledge a number of differences between the Chego and\nthe Masha claims. The Mashas, although never holding title to their\nland, had been forcibly removed. The resolution of the case was thus\nfacilitated by the claimants\u2019 longstanding involvement \u2013 as with many\ntitle-holder claims \u2013with human rights lawyers and land NGOs, whose\ninvolvement had been sparked not only by the evident injustice of the\nremoval, but also by the fact that the claimants had links \u2013 initiated\nat the moment of the removal itself \u2013 to political organizations and\nlabour unions. Since the case had received extensive media attention\nat the moment of removal some fifty years earlier, these links later\nfacilitated easier verification, since they had left a clear trail of evidence\nof rights \u2013 albeit \u2018informal\u2019 ones.\nThe forebears of Kalkfontein\u2019s claimants, according to oral tradition,\nhad lived there since the mid-nineteenth century. After their land\nhad been surveyed and sold to a land company, they continued to\nreside there as rent-paying tenants. Living under their chief, they\nhad retained some autonomy rather than being transformed into a\nresident farm labour force like the Chegos. Their freer participation\nin labour migration had led to complaints from neighbouring farmers\nkeen to secure a labour force; they were continually harassed by\nthe soldiers and police of the segregationist regime even before the\n1948 coming-to-power of Malan\u2019s Afrikaner Nationalist government.\nMany of the farm\u2019s residents, having worked as migrants on the Reef\nand having cultivated urban-based political connections, called upon\ntheir colleagues to help them stave off the eviction. There were well-\ndocumented visits to the farm by prominent anti-Apartheid activist\nand Communist Party member Ruth First, among others. Members\nof the Industrial and Commercial Workers Union (ICU) also played\na part. These interventions did not, however, succeed in preventing\nthe eviction, which was carried out by the army only after the 1948\nelection.6\n5 I later discovered from a Commission officer that this was indeed a factor stalling the\nChego claim and many like it.\n6This account is based on Schirmer (1994); Mulaudzi and Schirmer (2007: 364); and\ninterviews with Chief Masha, Strydkraal, 26 November 2002; 11 February 2003.\nMarch 2, 2009 Time: 02:30pm afr070.tex\nCONTESTING LAND CLAIMS IN MPUMALANGA 237\nEvicted members of the Masha chiefdom then settled, north of the\nSteelpoort River, in various parts of the reserve which later became the\nLebowa homeland, each of which was termed \u2018GaMasha\u2019 (the place\nof the Mashas), after the name of the chiefly family. Some settled\nwith their chief \u2013 and later his successor, the present incumbent of\nthe chiefship \u2013 on the farm Strydkraal deep in the heart of Lebowa\n(Figure 2: 1); some moved to the formerly white-owned farm\nGoedehoop which was later incorporated into Lebowa (Figure 2: 4);\nand others settled in a part of Lebowa that was closer to their original\nhome at Apiesboom just across the Steelpoort River (Figure 2: 8).\nThere were, then, differences between the Mashas and the Chegos\nin terms of the forcible nature of the removal, the levels of political\ninvolvement and influence, and the media profile and the availability\nof evidence that they had been unjustly dispossessed of their land.\nFollowing the Mashas\u2019 strategy of consolidating claims would nonethe-\nless have been a wise move for the Chegos. Led by their charismatic\nand influential chief, the Mashas had incorporated rather than excluding\ntheir rivals by claiming nine farms on behalf of a range of interrelated\nfamilies: families whose members would otherwise have lacked the\nknow-how to jump through the bureaucratic hoops in order to make\ntheir claims in time for the deadline. Chief Masha had stated his inten-\ntion to relinquish particular pieces of land by dropping them from the\nclaim if specific families subsequently insisted on individuating their\nown claims. Based on this and other examples, we suggested that cases\nuncomplicated by the demands of competing groups might receive\npreferential treatment by the Commission, and that the Chegos try to\nsettle their differences with rival claimants rather than relying on the\nCommission, at much cost in time and resources, to do so.\nThe story of the Chegos\u2019 hopes and anxieties was emblematic,\nechoing the concerns of many other claimants. Their interest in\nancestral graves \u2013 and their newly kindled awareness of associated\nartefacts of African \u2018customary practice\u2019 such as initiation lodges and\ncattle byres \u2013 had intensified with the promise of impending restitution.\nWhen the Commissioner or the hired consultant finally arrived, it was\nanticipated that these customary sites would serve as the markers of\ntheir former entitlements and hence as proof of their claim\u2019s validity.\nTheir suspicion of rival claimants was an index of the heightened\nexpectations, and resulting frustrations, aroused by the chimerical\npromise of land restitution based on informal rights.7 Although in at\nleast one local case, that of the Mashas, the promise had been realized,\nothers were being endlessly delayed.\n7This account is based on a meeting with the Chegos on 15 December 2002, as well as\nseveral other interviews in December 2002 at Magukubyana with members of the claimant\ngroup: Samuel Rampedi, Miriam Rampedi, Johanna Chego, Petrus Chego, Podile Chego\nand his wife, and Daniel Chego; and the following interviews at Sephaku: Selina Chego, 10\nDecember and Elizabeth Chego, 11 December.\nMarch 2, 2009 Time: 02:30pm afr070.tex\n238 CONTESTING LAND CLAIMS IN MPUMALANGA\nINTERSECTING INTERPRETATIONS\nPrior to 1994, many claimants had not entertained the possibility\nof returning to their previous homes. The undertakings of ANC\npoliticians and the activities of the Land Claims Commission served\nto draw attention to land and the past life it symbolized. This\nawareness was progressively sharpened, and memories reawakened,\nby the technical demands of the claiming process itself, as groups of\nclaimants \u2013 sometimes in secret \u2013 accompanied officers on strolls across\nthe familiar contours of their former homes and pointed out the sites of\ncattle byres and ancestral graves.\nThis process of remembrance signals a more general re-engagement\nwith the glorious African past and has, as discussed below, found\nexpression in a self-conscious reworking of history by the new political\nelite and by recently appointed public servants holding important\noffice. Its effects among ordinary claimants seem less grandiose,\nmore immediate. But both are underpinned by a spirit of localist\ncultural revivalism, making land into a key text, a set of symbols.\nIn cosmopolitan\/elite and localist\/popular consciousness alike, and as\na result of intense interactions between the two in the course of\nrestitution processes, there is evidence of renewed commitment to the\ntraditional values of cattle keeping and ploughing, interest in the rituals\nof initiation and circumcision, and dedication to ancestral propitiation\nand to maintaining the graves where this is pursued.\nLocated ambiguously between the two are officers in the Land\nClaims Commission. Working with claimants and becoming conversant\nwith the contents of the State Archives on behalf of these claimants and\nof themselves, they are newly fascinated with their own and their clients\u2019\nintertwined pasts. Their rediscovery of roots is not merely a means to\nregain land on their own or on claimants\u2019 behalf. Regaining land is\ntied up with bids for material resources and power in the contemporary\npolitical world, but also signifies a more general, more disinterested,\nrestitution of history.8\nThe need for recognizable proof of \u2018beneficial occupation\u2019, amongst\nCommissioners and claimants alike, has led to a sharpening of memory\nand to a rethinking of the past. In the process, aspirant chiefs\nhave tried to reconstitute empires; subjects have rejected chiefs and\naffiliated themselves to other leaders; and anthropologists, restyled\nas consultants, have collected genealogies and traced the location of\ncattle byres and initiation lodges in an attempt to find \u2018fixed proof\u2019\nof land occupancy.

Such promises by politicians\nhelped to generate new awareness of restitution, in Mpumalanga\nas elsewhere in South Africa, but leaders and followers did not\nnecessarily share precisely the same expectations.

Where the former, motivated by politicized ideas\nabout going \u2018back to the land\u2019, had a restitutive vision with sights set\non particular farms, the latter have been more interested in the general\npracticalities of land access and land use, wanting a place where they\ncould hold ceremonies, trade from home, farm, retreat at weekends,\nretire to, and die.

Kingwill, personal communication).\nThe aspirations of African nationalist leaders \u2013whether Mandela or\nthese lesser figures \u2013 have thus been key in shaping the \u2018political demand\nfor land\u2019 (Dolny 2001: 100). But more than the pronouncements of\nnational political figures, however popular, it is claimants\u2019 interactions\nwith the officers of the Land Claims Commission that have sustained\nand directed this awareness. Reciprocally, these officers\u2019 relationships\nwith claimants have sharpened their recognition of the historical details\nand complex procedures required in proof of former ownership or\noccupation. In this way, cosmopolitan and localist discourses have\nconverged to create a relatively uniform interpretation of land as text.\nThe recognition of informal rights alongside formal property ones\nas a basis for restitution, and Commission officers\u2019 attention to\nestablishing and verifying such rights, thus sparked a wider interest in\ngetting land back. The brown folders in the office of the Mpumalanga\nLand Claims Commission reveal that the terms of the 1994 Restitution\nAct would be satisfied by proof that they had been removed from their\nlands by \u2018racially discriminatory legislation\u2019 (see Figure 1) even if this\nhad not involved forced removal per se. The legislation in question was\nProclamation 177 of 1956, issued in terms of Chapter 4 of the Natives\nTrust and Land Act 1936 (18 of 1936): a law which had converted\nthese occupiers into illegal squatters and made their presence unlawful,\nthus effectively denying their land rights (Figure 3; see Mulaudzi and\nSchirmer, 2007: 362; Schirmer 1994). Evidencing the denial of these\nrights required a recognition of the peculiar way in which dispossession\nhad occurred: as mentioned earlier it had been a slow and gradual\nprocess, in which families had moved from farm to farm and eventually\ninto the homeland (Schirmer 1994, 1995: 522\u20133). Proof of racial\ndispossession did not seem difficult: the Commission\u2019s brown folders\nreveal that it simply necessitated the re-use of roughly the same form of\nwords in each of a succession of bureaucratic documents.\nActually finalizing their claims on the basis of informal rights,\nhowever, proved to be much more difficult. Given the lack of visible\nproof such as a title deed, there were greater possibilities for multiple\nclaimants on any given piece of land. This placed more stringent\ndemands on the officers charged with the bureaucratic process known\nMarch 2, 2009 Time: 02:30pm afr070.tex\n240 CONTESTING LAND CLAIMS IN MPUMALANGA\nFIGURE 3 Selected quotes, taken from files in office of the Land Claims\nCommission, Mpumalanga, documenting racial discrimination as a basis of\nloss of informal land rights.

Members\nof the Mashego clan resolved to lay claim to a huge area south of the\nOlifants River, stretching from the Vaal River and along the Kwazulu-\nNatal\/Free State border to Swaziland. They did this under the umbrella\nof the broader Mapulana polity which was alleged to have occupied the\narea before the arrival of the Swazis.\nSuch claims were later dismissed by Commission officers as\n\u2018frivolous\u2019 on the grounds that they dated back to the dawn of the\ncolonial period, to a time when major disputes over territory were\ntaking place between the chiefs and subjects of competing African\npolities rather than between white farmers and black tenants. The\nMarch 2, 2009 Time: 02:30pm afr070.tex\nCONTESTING LAND CLAIMS IN MPUMALANGA 241\ndismissal was also prompted by the claim\u2019s basis in, and attempt to\nreinstate, the jurisdiction of chiefly polities rather than reflecting the\nland rights (based on actual use) of particular families. Although the\nMashegos were then persuaded by the officer to make a more realistic\nand verifiable claim to the farms where their members had actually\nlived \u2013 around eight in number and centred on the \u2018anchor farm\u2019 of\nRoodewaal (Figure 2: G) \u2013 it was clear that the restitution process had\ninitially stirred imperial, and ethnically divisive, visions of the African\npast.\nThese were not only oriented to history, but also connected to the\nrealities of contemporary status. The chairman elected to represent the\ncommunity was a person of local political standing. Formerly active\nin South Africa\u2019s dissident civic associations and in the trade union\nmovement during the Apartheid era, he had then been appointed to\na position in the Mpumalanga Government. Having grown up with a\nmore \u2018coloured-sounding\u2019 surname (in part to disguise himself from\nhis pursuers in the South African police), his current role as lead\nland claimant echoed his involvement with a more Africanist identity\npolitics in which his descent from the original chief Mashego was key.\nMixed with urbanity and sophistication, there was perhaps a taste of\nopportunism alongside a genuine search for identity in his rediscovery\nof African roots.\nMotivated by equally intense if chimerical visions of lost imperial\nsplendour were chiefly attempts to regain land across international\nborders of more than a century\u2019s standing. Chief Mlambo Mahlalela\ntried to lodge a claim to a vast swathe of land crossing both the Swazi\nand Mozambican borders:\n[H]e is supposed to be a chief of the Swazi. He is claiming land in\nSwaziland, saying that his forefathers were never aware, when they put up\nthe international boundary, that it was anything more than just a cattle fence.\nHe also claims he lost land, jurisdiction, and tribute, in respect of some land\nwhich was demarcated as part of Mozambique.9\nSuch aspirations were not merely founded upon memories of the\nhistorically distant European conquest. They drew on, and seemed\nset to reignite, strongly felt emotions concerning a long-standing\nborder dispute between South Africa and Swaziland (see Griffiths and\nFunnell 1991; Makhura 2007: 113). But they were also prompted by\npresent and immediate events. Mahlalela felt his authority was under\nthreat from restitution claims by other groups who, for a time, had\nacknowledged him as chief. These claims, in turn, had been laid in\norder to reverse the effects of other, earlier, Apartheid resettlements.\nOverall, the joint power of land and history may thus buttress,\nor undermine, the authority of new, or aspirational, political elites.\nAnother case shows how members of the emergent elite have coat-\ntailed on the re-engagement with the past undertaken by land claims\n9Philip Mbiba, Nelspruit, 26 January 2001.\nMarch 2, 2009 Time: 02:30pm afr070.tex\n242 CONTESTING LAND CLAIMS IN MPUMALANGA\ncommittees.

Ngomane, although professing not to\n\u2018know anything about the claim . . . it is my elders who are organizing\nit\u2019, has nonetheless developed an intense interest in the history of his\nforebears which closely parallels the progress of restitution.

From early on, the African\nresearchers and fieldworkers appointed by the land NGOs to act as their\ntranslators, researchers or mediators had, themselves, been recruited\nfrom dispossessed and resettled communities. Many of these, after\n1994, were then employed by the Commission and have continued to\nhold office there. African land claimants occupy positions right up\nto the highest levels of office in the Commission: they include both\nthe original Chief Land Claims Commissioner, Joe Seremane, and his\nsuccessor, Wallace Mgoqi. But in addition to these elevated personages\nwho are drawn from the ranks of former title holders, others at lower\nlevels in the Land Claims Commission hierarchy have laid claims to\nancestral land on the basis of informal rights rather than of former\ntitle. They have correspondingly acquired a strategic knowledge of the\nkinds of historical evidence and forms of localist cultural knowledge\nwhich might be adduced in support of their \u2013 and simultaneously of\ntheir clients\u2019 \u2013 claims.\nOne such person, who has worked on a variety of cases in the\nLowveld region and has himself laid a claim to Makobolwane, the\nland where his forebears lived, is Land Claims Commission officer\nPhilip Mbiba. In the process of investigating claims he has gained\ndetailed knowledge about the history of the area, and of his own family.\nA history graduate, his work on the Ten Bosch claim has involved\nintensive work in the National Archives. He provides a version of\nthe Ngomanes\u2019 history which focuses upon more recent events, and\nwhich shows the inextricable connection between different episodes of\nApartheid resettlement.\nThe Ngomane people, who\u2019d been living at Ten Bosch and had formerly\nlived in the present-day Kruger Park, and had at one stage lived in\nMozambique as well, were resettled, in order to accommodate returning\nwhite soldiers after the war. They were settled at Nkomazi, one of the former\nhomelands. . . . The resettlement happened in 1954, and the Mahlalela were\ndisplaced in order to make room for these incomers.\nThe land, formerly owned by one of these mining exploration companies\nto whom the occupiers had paid rent, was finally sold to Griffiths\nEngineering Company in 1944, and Griffiths decided to develop Ten Bosch:\nit began to put plots of land under irrigation. There is a whole file full of\nletters written to Jan Smuts and to the Commissioner: they were the ones\nwho decided to remove the people. This was in the days before Apartheid\nbecame official policy.\nHe had read archived correspondence between Jan Smuts and the\nlocal Native Commissioner demonstrating how the state with its then\nsegregationist policy had envisaged population resettlement well before\nthe advent of the Afrikaner Nationalist government. After Malan\nformed his new government in 1948, experimentation with one removal\nby the local state served as a stepping-stone which would later lead\nto another, as Mbiba discovered from an account of the Mashas\u2019\nMarch 2, 2009 Time: 02:30pm afr070.tex\n244 CONTESTING LAND CLAIMS IN MPUMALANGA\nremoval from Kalkfontein.11 His archival research was furnishing a\ncomprehensive picture of the state\u2019s policy of forced relocation in the\nregion as a whole, and providing insight into the interwoven stories of\na number of resettled groups:\nBefore this [Ten Bosch\/Ngomane] removal, the Masha people liv-\ning at Kalkfontein had been removed. The Chief Native Commis-\nsioner . . . removed the Mashas . . . as a kind of experiment to see whether\nthe Ten Bosch case could then be pursued.\nAfter the Masha removal, he served an eviction notice on Ten Bosch\u2019s\nChief Mpothi Ngomane, a Tsonga-speaker. The chief was deported to\nVryburg, and they told him, \u2018if you [and your people] refuse to be relocated\nto Nkomazi we\u2019ll bring you here to this dry land\u2019. They showed him the\nNative Administration Act, saying they would depose him if he didn\u2019t\nagree . . . . By this time the community \u2013 or those who agreed \u2013 had already\nbeen removed. Others were scattered all over, some women and children\nabandoned their kraals and were never heard of again. There was a huge\ndispersal \u2013 some went to Witbank and some to Pretoria.\nThey\u2019d been rent tenants in 1920. Some were migrants, but others were\nseasonal labourers on Lowveld farms. There\u2019d actually been a recruitment\ncamp there, for recruiting seasonal labour. They seem to have had a\ntraditional lifestyle, with cattle as a mainstay. In 1939 there was a cattle\nculling, because of foot and mouth disease, and the community started to\nhate the agricultural extension officers because of this.\nThere are very evocative stories of how the troopers came in to shoot\nthe cattle. The Ngomane used dogs to scare the troopers, and the troopers\nshot the dogs and even some people. There are stories of people running\nhelter-skelter, of the rivers running red with blood. They called this event\nEsitsotsongwane.12\nSuch insights caused him to observe, laughingly, that \u2018a new Oxford\nHistory of South Africa will have to be written\u2019: something he may sadly\nbe prevented from accomplishing by the sheer weight of effort involved\nin processing land claims.\nAlthough neither the Ngomanes of Ten Bosch nor the Mashas\nof Kalkfontein had held formal title, these were two linked cases\nin which \u2018racially discriminatory legislation\u2019 and its enforcement had\nincontrovertibly resulted in communities\u2019 dispossession of land, and\nwhere archival evidence was available to prove this. Mbiba had tracked\ndown this evidence in the archive, but his building of the Ten Bosch\ncase required further validation. He arranged to hire an anthropologist-\nturned-consultant, At Visser, who spent months interviewing old\nhouseholders, compiling genealogies and drawing up maps based on\naerial photos from the 1930s as evidence of former land usage.13\nThis process of claimant verification on the basis of informal rights\nclarified the kinds of proof which might be needed in support of Philip\n11This was the group whose strategies of consolidation we had brought to the Chegos\u2019\nattention.\n12Philip Mbiba, Nelspruit, 26 January 2001.\n13Philip Mbiba, Nelspruit, 30\u201331 October 2003.\nMarch 2, 2009 Time: 02:30pm afr070.tex\nCONTESTING LAND CLAIMS IN MPUMALANGA 245\nMbiba\u2019s own land claim. Being too low-profile to have left a record\nin the archives, his family\u2019s occupancy of the farm where they lived as\ntenants required other kinds of proof. The catalogue of evidence he\nwas slowly amassing includes things like graves, initiation lodges and\ncattle byres as well as the ruins of a school which some of his cousins\nattended.\nRedirecting our attention from politicians attempting to reconstitute\nentire pre-colonial empires to the views of more low-level claimants,\ninteraction with Commission officers has likewise led to a re-envisaging\nof history. Mr Mthethwa, who currently owns a small taxi business,\nhas a specific claim to the farm Heidelberg nested within the broader\nMashego claim discussed earlier. His visions of the past, although less\ngrandiose and politicized, and more localized and concrete, than those\nof his leaders, are equally intense.\nA former occupant of the farm who once worked as a cook for its\nowner, his memories of a life lived on the land contain the promise of\na future there. He recounted conditions similar to those of the Chegos:\nbeing paid only in kind, restricted from working for migrant wages,\nhaving his quota of cattle gradually restricted and later confiscated,\neventually being prohibited from conducting traditional rituals on the\nfarm, and finally being evicted with his family. His lament was tempered\nby a sense that life on the farm had been preferable to his subsequent\nexistence in a relocation village in the homeland and later an urban\ntownship: \u2018where we live now . . . we are packed together like chickens\u2019.\nHis motivation for lodging a claim was that\nwe want to go back because we lived there, farming and having livestock.\nI was born and bred there, I grew up farming, and I want to go back, to feed\nmy children and the future generations.14\nCombining distress at past ill-treatment with a promise of better\ntimes ahead, his account is reminiscent of much of the \u2018golden age\u2019\ntestimony of resettled people (Harries 1987). It could be viewed with\nscepticism, given that his subsequent life experiences \u2013 a period of wage\nlabour followed by starting a minibus taxi business \u2013 had resulted in\ngreater material well-being than he could have achieved as a farm-\ndweller. If he eventually uses his reclaimed farm as a means to \u2018feed the\nfuture generations\u2019, the success of his farming enterprise will probably\ndepend as much upon its funding by his entrepreneurial achievements\nas upon access to the land itself.\nAncestral graves: sentimental ties and evidence\nThe importance of ancestral graves in Mr Mthethwa\u2019s claim has been\ncentral. Being forbidden to visit these graves during the intervening\nyears was a source of grievance:\n14Mr Mthethwa, Nelspruit, 13 November 2002.\nMarch 2, 2009 Time: 02:30pm afr070.tex\n246 CONTESTING LAND CLAIMS IN MPUMALANGA\n[W]e visited, but the new owner did not want us to go there. He said\n\u2018just take the people away from the graves and rebury them where you are\nstaying\u2019. I contacted the funeral parlour and the police, and they negotiated\non my behalf. We negotiated with the farmer that I would always arrange to\ncall him in advance, not just come along unannounced for what he called\n\u2018a party\u2019.15\nSimilarly restrictive has been the experience of other former farm-\ndwellers:\nPresently we cannot visit our graves as the whites refuse us permission \u2013 or\nthey put conditions and rules if they do allow us. It is difficult to follow our\nculture.16\nKnowledge of the existence and whereabouts of such graves has\nbecome a means to prove informal rights. Mthethwa, like other\nclaimants seeking \u2018verification\u2019, has accompanied the project officer\nonto the farm to show him \u2018where we used to live, where the graveyards\nof our grandparents are\u2019, as did those lodging the overarching Mashego\nclaim of which Mthethwa\u2019s is a subdivision:\n[W]e still have some elders who know the places exactly. We have gone to\nthe farms to identify the gravesites and so on . . . . They were able to say,\n\u2018this site here was a burial place for the Mthethwas, together with Mzawe,\nMashego\u2019, and so on.17\nAs in other cases, members of the Mashego claiming committee had\nto do this clandestinely, given that the farms in question are still in the\npossession of their white owners; white farmers, increasingly anxious\nabout the claiming process, are aware that graves are fast becoming the\nmost powerful proof of former residence.\nThis we did underground \u2013 illegally. We still have access to the farm and\nsome of our people are still staying there, so we do visit them. But it was\nrather difficult. We do still go from time to time go to clean the graves.\nInitially the farmers did not mind but now they are resisting.\nThus informants\u2019 commitment to the specific sites of their forebears\u2019\ngraves, like the importance of the past more generally, has intensified\nduring the claiming process itself. For the Chegos, the ANC\u2019s election\npromises had sparked an awareness, resulting in more frequent visits to\ndiscuss the claim with those still living on the farms and to perform\nancestral rituals at the grave sites. This ritually inspired traffic flow\nbetween the former Lebowa homeland and the white farms at Tubatse\nled to the traffic accident, which in turn deepened the sense of\ncommunity solidarity within the group, its commitment to the now\n15Mr Mthethwa, Nelspruit, 13 November 2002.\n16Commission claimant file KRP 2427, Buffelshoek and others, Phadzimane Community,\nMr Madala Lawrence Maphanga.\n17David Mashego, Nelspruit, 30 January 2003.\nMarch 2, 2009 Time: 02:30pm afr070.tex\nCONTESTING LAND CLAIMS IN MPUMALANGA 247\ntragically restocked community graves, its determination to regain its\nland, and its frustration at the delays:\nI think this [claiming] was brought up by the accident the Chego people\nhad, even though the idea was there before the accident . . . .

Traditionally,\nthese were in any case not marked out for special attention, being\nsimply contained within the cattle byre.20 The current importance of\nburial sites in South Africa appears to be motivated as much by the\nwishes of disrupted people to secure their own future burial, and\nhence their place in the genealogical line of shades, as by the need to\nlive close to a long lineage of already-buried ancestors (James 2000).\nThe emphasis on graves, then, has grown in inverse proportion to\nresettled people\u2019s distance from them; it reflects a sense that graveyard\naccess has been unjustly denied. Such an observation does not suggest\na lack of authenticity in claimants\u2019 insistence on access to graves, but it\ndemonstrates the intensifying significance of these in the cultural revival\nwhich has accompanied the land claims process.\nCONCLUSION\nThe symbolic and economic claims on land can be hard to reconcile.\nArousing millennial expectations and exaggerated fears, land policies\nhave been charged with conflicting tasks. On a practical level, land\nreform has been counted upon to ameliorate unemployment and\nrural poverty, and to create a new and prosperous class of African\nfarmers. On a symbolic level, the aim is to restore lost citizenship and\nnationhood and to provide restitutive justice. At the same time, land\nreform is expected to resolve racial tensions which it has itself partly\ncreated.\nThis article has tried to show how these contradictory expectations\nplay out in just one aspect of the programme: that in which \u2018informal\nrights\u2019 form the basis for claims. It demonstrates how land in South\n18Miriam Rampedi, Magukubyana, 17 December 2002.\n19 Johanna Chego, Magukubyana, 17 December 2002.\n20My own earlier research among Sotho- and Pedi-speaking migrant women indicated that\nsuch rituals could as effectively be performed by scattering snuff or pouring libations on the\nground in the corner of a house \u2013 even in a servant\u2019s domestic living quarters in town \u2013 as at\nthe site of ancestral graves (James 1999).\nMarch 2, 2009 Time: 02:30pm afr070.tex\n248 CONTESTING LAND CLAIMS IN MPUMALANGA\nAfrica is like a \u2018text\u2019 which has rich symbolic meanings, and how its\nrestoration has become a fulcrum both for contestations and for some\nconvergent interpretations between cosmopolitan and localist ideas\nabout the nature of citizenship.\nLocally, there is an insistence that land restitution was intended to\nbenefit all Africans rather than just former title holders or members\nof the new elite. Policy makers defined restitution with sufficient\nbreadth to accommodate at least some such egalitarian visions of land\nentitlement. But restitution has nonetheless served to reaffirm old\nhierarchies (James 2007: 105\u201329; Murray 1996, 2000) and to create\nnew ones. For elite leaders of high-profile claims, such as Mashego\nor those among the Ngomane group who are heading the Ten Bosch\napplication, the successful conclusion of their cases would certainly\nbuttress, though their failure would not necessarily undermine, their\nnew-found importance as political figures in the region. For the\nMashas, a high-profile group with an influential chief and a recognized\nplace in the history of Apartheid struggle, the \u2018political demand for\nland\u2019 was answered at the moment when the Minister of Land Affairs\nceremonially \u2018handed over\u2019 the farm to its claimants, though its future\nin practical, economic terms was still being negotiated at the time of\nwriting. But other, humbler claimants like the Chegos, despite their\nsad accident, were still waiting.\nLand alone would in any case make little difference to the livelihood\nof claimants who lack other sources of income and influence. It is in fact\nwidely recognized that land, if delivered without accompanying support\nand protection, is disconnected from the social dependencies which\nmight enable claimants to use it: that is, from the various paternalist\nframeworks which \u2013 at least in idealized, remembered terms \u2013 once\noperated to stabilize their forebears\u2019 lives on the land. Although\npaternalism and political patronage run counter to state policy, the\ncircumstances are such as to encourage the intervention of brokers:\nmediators between the state and land reform\u2019s beneficiaries. Some, like\nthe Land Claims Commission officers discussed in this article, have\nbeen appointed to do so, in recognition of the fact that migrant\/country-\ndwellers with little education would have difficulty accessing state\nresources or participating in state programmes without help. On a less\nofficial level, others include chiefs, entrepreneurs and the members\nof new elites who are consolidating their positions along ethnic lines.\nLand, rewritten histories, and cultural revival have become part of the\nprocess \u2013 but they have significance beyond a mere crude consolidation\nof resources or power.\nA further meaning of the \u2018text\u2019 of land, in this context, is that of resti-\ntutive justice. Restitution has been seen, in part, as furnishing a Truth\nand Reconciliation Commission of the South African countryside.\nSome claimants feel that they deserve to have the land back \u2018so we can\nfarm it as the whites once did\u2019. For others the need to affix their names\nto land claims is driven mainly by a sense of wanting public acknowl-\nedgement for past wrongs suffered at the hands of farmers, or \u2013 in the\ncase of the Mashas or Ngomanes \u2013 at the hands of the police or army\nMarch 2, 2009 Time: 02:30pm afr070.tex\nCONTESTING LAND CLAIMS IN MPUMALANGA 249\npersonnel who forcefully evicted them from the farms where they once\nlived. Despite much decrying of state inadequacy, a number of targets\nhave indeed been met in pursuit of the goal of transferring land across\nthe racial frontier. But such successes nonetheless pose the question:\nwhere farming no longer receives state subsidy and where farmers are\nexpected to \u2018go it alone\u2019 in an era where market principles predominate,\ncan land be farmed any more successfully by blacks than by whites?\nThis question, like others raised by the land reform process, is only\njust beginning to be answered.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis research was funded by a grant from the Economic and Social Research\nCouncil of the UK (award R000239795), which I gratefully acknowledge.

Partly\nMarch 2, 2009 Time: 02:30pm afr070.tex\nCONTESTING LAND CLAIMS IN MPUMALANGA 251\nprompted by emerging policy discourses, iconic tropes of localized cultural\nexperience such as grave sites, initiation lodges and cattle byres acquired\nnew significance. Because they proved what the Land Claims Commission\ncalls \u2018informal rights\u2019 to land, they became verifiable evidence of effective\npossession, and thus grounds on which to claim the restoration of such land.\nThe meaning of land, the nature of ownership and the legitimacy of its\nrestoration were all matters contested between claimants, policy makers and\nhuman rights lawyers. They were also contested by those at different levels\nin the hierarchical social order of the new South Africa. Members of the\nAfrican nationalist political elite, in dialogue with lawyers, cherished one set\nof understandings, while ordinary migrant\/country-dwellers tended to hold to\nanother. Both, however, were mediated through the new discourse on informal\nrights. It is neither purely through the activities of cosmopolitan elites with their\n\u2018political demand for land\u2019 nor through the unmediated localist experience of\nless sophisticated country-dwellers with more practical orientations that the\nsignificance of land becomes evident, but in the interaction between the two.\nBased on local understandings, transformed in the course of thirty years of\n\u2018land back\u2019 struggles, and finally negotiated over the course of the last ten years,\na new diasporic consensus on what \u2018the land\u2019 signifies has been established.\nR\u00c9SUM\u00c9\nDans la nouvelle Afrique du Sud, la promesse d\u2019une restitution des terres\na suscit\u00e9 des attentes de style mill\u00e9naire parmi les d\u00e9poss\u00e9d\u00e9s et les anciens\npropri\u00e9taires terriens dispers\u00e9s. Pouss\u00e9s en partie par des discours de politique\n\u00e9mergents, des tropes iconiques d\u2019exp\u00e9rience culturelle localis\u00e9e comme\nles lieux d\u2019inhumation, loges d\u2019initiation et \u00e9tables ont acquis une nouvelle\nsignification. Parce qu\u2019ils ont prouv\u00e9 ce que la commission charg\u00e9e d\u2019examiner\nles demandes de restitution de terres appelle des \u00abdroits informels\u00bb, ils sont\ndevenus des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve v\u00e9rifiables de possession effective, et par\ncons\u00e9quent des motifs de revendication de restitution de ces terres. Parmi les\nsujets de contestation soulev\u00e9s par les demandeurs, d\u00e9cideurs et avocats sp\u00e9-\ncialistes des droits de l\u2019homme figuraient la signification de la terre, la nature\nde la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et la l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 de sa restitution. Autant de sujets \u00e9galement\ncontest\u00e9s \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents niveaux de l\u2019ordre social hi\u00e9rarchique de la nouvelle\nAfrique du Sud. Les membres de l\u2019\u00e9lite politique nationaliste africaine, en di-\nalogue avec des juristes, affectionnaient un corps d\u2019interpr\u00e9tations, tandis que\nles migrants\/ruraux ordinaires avaient tendance \u00e0 se r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 un autre. Tous\ndeux, cependant, passaient par le nouveau discours sur les droits informels.\nCe n\u2019est ni dans les activit\u00e9s des \u00e9lites cosmopolitaines et leur \u00abrevendication\nfonci\u00e8re politique\u00bb, ni dans l\u2019exp\u00e9rience localiste sans m\u00e9diation des ruraux\nmoins sophistiqu\u00e9s et leurs orientations plus pratiques, que l\u2019importance de la\nterre devient manifeste, mais dans l\u2019interaction entre les deux. Fond\u00e9 sur des\ninterpr\u00e9tations locales qui se sont transform\u00e9es au fil de trente ann\u00e9es de luttes\npour le \u00abretour des terres\u00bb, puis n\u00e9goci\u00e9 au cours des dix derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, un\nnouveau consensus diasporique a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli sur ce que signifie \u00abla terre\u00bb.\n"}
