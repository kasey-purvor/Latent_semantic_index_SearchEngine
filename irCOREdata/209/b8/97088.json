Colorectal cancer (CRC) is responsible for nearly half a million deaths annually world-\nwide [11]. We present a series of mathematical models describing the dynamics of the intestinal \nepithelium and the kinetics of the molecular pathway most commonly mutated in CRC, the Wnt \nsignalling network. We also discuss how we are coupling such models to build a multiscale model \nof normal and aberrant guts.

The renewal of the intestinal epithelium is initiated at the bottom of these \ncrypts, where a small number of stem cells provide a continuous supply of transit cells \nthat divide rapidly a few times before undergoing terminal differentiation. Near the top \nof the crypt, mature cells initiate apoptosis and detach from the surface. Under normal \nconditions, proliferation, differentiation, death and migration take place in a tightly \ncoordinated manner CRC occurs as a consequence of genetic and epigenetic alterations \nleading to dysfunction of these cellular processes and causing loss of homeostasis. \nFurther mutations are needed for progression to a mahgnant carcinoma. \nCRC is an extensively studied mahgnancy and both the quantity and variety of avail-\nable data on this disease are inexorably increasing. We beheve that mathematical mod-\nelling represents an ideal tool for integrating this highly disparate information (for a \nreview of previous modelling approaches to CRC, see [7]). The advances in the devel-\nopment of supercomputers and Grid technology make it now possible to build, analyse \nand simulate detailed multiscale models of complex biological systems [3].

Furthermore, Alarcon et al \n[1] have recently formulated a hybrid cellular automaton model which intimately cou-\nples tumour growth with nutrient delivery via the vascular system, which remodels and \nadapts to nutrient demands. It is now timely to develop speciahsed mathematical models \nof this type to describe CRC. \nMODELLING WNT SIGNALLING \nRegulation and control of the biochemical pathways within the intestinal epithelium are \nhighly complex involving numerous players. To date, models have tended to simplify \nthe system and focus on a few processes in order to gain insights which eventually \nmay help in understanding the more realistic, complex situation. For example, the \nWingless\/lnt (Wnt) pathway is thought to play an important role in the renewal of the \nintestinal epithelium by, for instance, helping to maintain stem-ceU niches and control \ncell migration. Wnt signaUing acts by controUing the activity of the APC-complex, \nwhich is responsible for regulating cytoplasmic levels of \/3-catenin (Fig 1). In the \npresence of extracellular Wnt factors, stimulation of specific receptors on the ceU surface \ntriggers a cascade of protein interactions and modifications, leading to inhibition of the \nAPC-complex, subsequent accumulation of \/3-catenin in the nucleus and, eventually, \nexpression of Wnt target genes. Importantly, over 90% of CRCs bear genetic alterations \nthat impede APC-mediated degradation of \/3-catenin, thereby mimicking a continuous \nWnt signal [4]. \nextracellular \nWnt signal \nWnt \n^ target gene \nexpression \nP \u2014catenin \ndegradation \nPROLIFERATION \nDIFFERENTIATION \n\u00bb .

In the Wnt 'off' state, the APC-complex phospho-\nrylates j3-catenin at specific residues, which marks it for rapid degradation. Most j3-catenin is then located \nat the cell membrane, as part of cell-cell adhesion complexes, and the Wnt target genes are not expressed. \nIn the Wnt 'on' state, stimulation of the Wnt receptors causes loss of activity of the APC-complex. \nConsequently, j3-catenin accumulates and travels to the nucleus, where it binds to the transcription factor \nTCF\/LEF and induces the expression of Wnt targets, including genes coding for proteins involved in \nthe regulation of fundamental cellular processes, such as cell-cycle control and active migration. It is \nimportant to point out that, in reality, this schematic is only part of a more complex scheme, and the role \nof modelling here is to try to gain insights into the workings of component parts of the larger network \nstructure. \nDownloaded 23 Apr 2008 to 163.1.149.69. Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/proceedings.aip.org\/proceedings\/cpcr.jsp\nVan Leeuwen et al [8] have recently formulated a model of the Wnt pathway, con-\nsisting of 11 coupled ordinary differential equations. Unlike Lee et al's [6] approach, \nthis model accounts for the dual role of \/3 -catenin in signal transduction and cell-cell \nadhesion (Fig 1). It has been proposed that the adhesion molecule E-cadherin and the \ntranscription factor TCF\/LEF simply compete for \/3-catenin binding {M'.l). Alterna-\ntively, it has been hypothesised that Wnt induces a conformational change in \/3-catenin \nthat favours TCF\/LEF binding {M'.l). Analysis of the model equations revealed that \nboth M'. 1 and M'.l give rise to the same level of target-gene expression after long-term \nWnt exposure, independently of the model parameter values. However, under M'.l, Wnt \nstimulation always results in an increase in cell-cell adhesion whereas, under M'.l, cell-\ncell adhesion can decrease in response to Wnt if the rate of change in conformation is \nsufficiently high. The model was also exploited to evaluate the consequences of mu-\ntations in APC and \/3-catenin. A particularly interesting result is that the proportion \nof functional APC required to maintain a normal phenotype increases with increasing \nstrength of the Wnt signal. This illustrates that the envirormient can substantially influ-\nence both tumour initiation and phenotype. \nMODELLING CRYPT DYNAMICS \nIn a normal, healthy colonic crypt, the total number of cells remains approximately \nconstant, with cell production balancing ceU removal. Tomhnson and Bodmer [12] used \nmathematical modeUing to identify key events that can lead to loss of homeostasis and \ntumour formation. They considered three pools of ceUs (stem, transit and differentiated) \nthat divide synchronously (Fig 2). In the stem cell pool, after division, each newly \nproduced daughter cell can die, become a transit cell or remain a stem cell. Transit \ncells are assumed to behave similarly, whereas differentiated cells are only subject \nto a constant removal probabflity. The model predicted that failure of apoptosis or \ndifferentiation, in addition to increased proliferation, can eventually cause exponential \ngrowth of the cell population through a series of steps, so that one can account for the \nexistence of benign tumours and the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. \nk death k death \ndifferentiation \newal \ntransit \ncells \n\/ \\ ren \ndifferentiation \newal \ndifferentiated \ncells \nremoval \nstem cells \nFIGURE 2. Schematic of the models by Tomlinson and Bodmer [12] and Johnston et al [5], which \nprovide equations characterising the numbers of stem, transit and differentiated cells. \nJohnston et al [5] have recently relaxed the assumption of cell-cycle synchronicity \nused by Tomlinson and Bodmer [12] by developing complementary age-structured and \ncontinuum models. They also extended the original model to incorporate a putative \nfeedback-loop regulating crypt homeostasis: they assumed that the proportions of stem \nand transit cells undergoing differentiation are increasing functions of the corresponding \nDownloaded 23 Apr 2008 to 163.1.149.69.

When these relationships are hnear, only genetic alterations which dis-\nrupt the feedback mechanism can stimulate uncontrolled growth. In contrast, when the \nrelations are characterised by saturating functions, unbounded growth can occur when-\never the net per-capita growth rates are sufficiently large. Notably, this prediction pro-\nvides new insight into the multistep nature of tumour development. According to the \nmodel, early mutations in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence are responsible for a step-\nwise increase in the net per-capita growth rates, which allows the cell population to pro-\ngressively reach new, larger equilibrium sizes. Uncontrolled growth will, however, not \noccur until further mutations raise the per-capita growth rates beyond critical thresholds. \nTOWARDS A MULTISCALE MODEL \nIn the previous section, the general dynamics of a colonic crypt were modelled without \nconsidering the spatial location of individual cells within the crypt or the effect of ex-\ntracellular conditions on the behaviour of the system. Cell-cycle time and proliferation, \ndifferentiation and death rates are intrinsic properties of the cells. Experimental evidence \nsuggests, however, that a gradient of Wnt factors along the crypt axis may play a role in \ndictating when epithelial cells should, for instance, undergo terminal differentiation or \ncommence apoptosis [2]. Using the lattice-free model developed by Meineke et al [9] as \na framework, we are building a multiscale model of a colonic crypt, in which parameters \ncontrolhng cellular process may depend on biochemical and biomechanical signals and, \nthus, on cell position. This approach enables us to evaluate the effect of specific genetic \naberrations within the Wnt pathway on crypt dynamics, morphology and homeostasis. \nCrucial for the success of this type of approach is the development of realistic models at \neach spatial level and their integration into a computationally tractable multiscale model. \nThe computational aspects of the project are being tackled using a novel agile pro-\ngramming technology, involving a multidisciphnary team of software engineers, math-\nematical modellers and scientific programmers. A crucial feature of this technology is \nthe extensive, rigorous use of tests: before any new piece of code is incorporated into the \nmain program, the main code must pass a specific test, relating to the new code, without \ncausing failure of any previous tests. This work opens the door to a new dimension of \nscience, in which knowledge from different disciplines may be integrated by exploiting \nfully the latest computational advances. \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the support provided by the EPSRC (GR\/S72023\/0I). \nPKM was partially supported by a Royal Society-Wolfson Research Merit Award. \nREFERENCES \n1.
