The process of suburbanization occurred more rapidly in London than in any other British city, 83 but even in the metropolis the distances over which most people travelled to work remained relatively short. 84 Evidence from the family history database of lifetime residential histories suggests that the journey to work changed only slowly in the nineteenth century, and that it was not until after the First World War that the ties between home and workplace were broken, and improved urban transport systems linked to rising real incomes allowed longer-distance commuting for large numbers of people.","cites":null},{"id":16710822,"title":"95 Although much has changed in the century 90 Lash and Urry, The End of Organized Capitalism; Jessop, Fordism and Post-Fordism;","authors":[],"date":"1995","doi":null,"raw":"95 Although much has changed in the century 90 Lash and Urry, The End of Organized Capitalism; Jessop, Fordism and Post-Fordism; Gilbert et al., Fordism and Flexibility; D.

He was ill for about a month, during which time his pregnant wife nursed him and ran the shop singlehanded. He then travelled to his aunt's at Doncaster to convalesce for two weeks before returning to work. Inevitably the business had been neglected during his illness, but thereafter takings began to rise and the Jaques sublet part of their house to increase their income. However, by the summer of 1866 the couple were in serious financial difficulties: Many a time when the day came to take up a bill I found myself several pounds short and more than once had to seek the aid of the Pawnbroker for the time being. 50 Mr Isaac offered to help by providing more capital to cover the debts and Henry Jaques entered into a financial arrangement which was eventually to lead to his downfall. Isaac would take responsibility for all outgoings, but all receipts would also be banked in his name and he charged 5 per cent for all money imported into the business. Writing retrospectively Jaques says: it seems a marvel that anyone in his senses would agree to such terms, which virtually amounted to 5% per week for the use of the money. It would not be possible to have me thus now - but I was in a tight corner and very inexperienced in finance, and the desperate position was such that I did not probe into the future effects of this arrangement. 51 The high interest being paid to Mr Isaac for his additional loans, together with a continuing lack of capital, meant that the business was doomed.","cites":null},{"id":16710828,"title":"Housing and Labour Markets: Building the Connections (London,","authors":[],"date":"1991","doi":null,"raw":"95 J.

Such working practices were clearly linked into an advanced capitalist economy as home workers were supplying large wholesale merchants who distributed goods throughout Britain and overseas. However, such production systems were a far cry from the organized 'Fordist' systems of large-scale factory production which had already emerged in some industrial sectors by the mid-nineteenth century, and which dominated British and European manufacturing industry in the first half of the twentieth century. 88 The advantages of such production practices were that they lowered overhead costs for merchants and manufacturers who did not have to invest capital in their own workshops, and the flexible working arrangements meant that workers could change jobs easily and maximize their income in an uncertain labour market. The downsides of this system were the low wages and harsh working conditions experienced by many, and the uncertainty of employment with home workers not knowing from day to day whether their services would be needed by large City wholesalers. 89 Henry Jaques was better off than many London workers, but clearly saw his home-based shirtmaking as an essential supplement to his income in the City. He clung to this work even when he was reasonably prosperous and living in a suburban location. It can be suggested that for people like Henry Jaques, home working also became a way of life.","cites":null},{"id":906976,"title":"The precariousness of employment in the London clothing trade is illustrated by the fact that later in 1868 Henry Jaques was once more forced to seek new employment: I found it a stupendous task to solicit orders for a small unknown house","authors":[],"date":null,"doi":null,"raw":null,"cites":null},{"id":906742,"title":"The Shopkeepers' World (Manchester,","authors":[],"date":"1983","doi":null,"raw":"55 M.

The life history of Henry\nJaques demonstrates the way in which decisions about employment and resi-\ndence were related both to each other and to stages of the family life course. The\nuncertainty of work, lack of income to support a growing family, rising aspira-\ntions, the constant threat of illness, the ease of moving between rented property,\nclose ties between home and workplace, the stresses produced by home working,\nand the attractions of suburbanization all interacted to shape the residential and\nemployment history of Jaques and his family.

A small number of\nstudies of intra-urban residential mobility have demonstrated the extent\nto which many people moved frequently between similar properties\nwithin quite a small area,1 but the relationship of such movement to\nemployment change has rarely been explored, and there are few detailed\nstudies of the changing journey to work in the nineteenth century.2\n* We are indebted to A.M.

Most places were 'walking cities',3 and even in late nineteenth-\ncentury London it was estimated that over three-quarters of trade union-\nists in South London used no public transport for their journey to and from\nwork.4 A short journey to work was required both because many trades\nwere casual, and there was thus a strong imperative to be part of a\ncommunity which knew when work was available,5 especially on the\ndocks,6 and because of the inability of most working people to afford\npublic transport.7 In the twentieth century rising real incomes and rela-\ntively cheap public transport have meant that the journey to work has\nlengthened,8 that a change in workplace is less likely to lead to a change in\nresidence, and that moves for housing and family reasons can occur\nwithout the constraint of needing to be close to employment.9\nThe link between home and workplace was also closely related to the\nlife course,10 with different demands made on both employment and\nstructure', Economic Geography, 42 (1966), 294-325; idem, Housing the worker determi-\nnative and contingent ties in nineteentiVcentury Birmingham', Economic Geography, 43\n(1967), 95-127; R.

In the nineteenth century\nmany single men and women would have lived and worked in the same\nplace, apprenticed to a master or as a farm or domestic servant.11\nMarriage and family commitments would have meant the need for\ngreater independence, a higher disposable income and an independent\nhome.12 Thus decisions about the location of home and workplace, and\nthe relationship between them, changed over the life course and cannot\nbe seen as independent of broader changes within society - for instance\nthe decline in farm and domestic servants - which affected patterns of\nwork and living.\nThis paper focuses primarily on the life history of one man, Henry\nJaques, to explore some aspects of the relationship between home and\nworkplace in Victorian London. Analysis examines the reasons why\nresidential and occupational change occurred, the links between them\nand the life course of individual actors, and the impact of such changes\non the Jaques household. Following a brief assessment of the source on\nwhich the paper is based, and an introductory resume of Jaques's life,\nanalysis is focused on three reasonably distinct life-cycle phases: his\nexperiences as a young single adult, his early married life, and his more\nmature married life moving into old age. It is not suggested that the\nevidence presented in this paper is necessarily typical of a larger\npopulation, but detailed analysis of one life history does raise many\ngeneral issues of much wider applicability. These points are returned to\nin a concluding discussion where the experiences of Henry Jaques are\nrelated to other evidence about changes in home and workplace in\nVictorian London.\nThe context\nIn the second half of the nineteenth century London was a sprawling\nmetropolis, with the County of London covering an area of some 74,672\nacres within its administrative boundaries, and with a population of\nover 4.2 million in 1891.13 It can be suggested that, more than most\nVictorian cities, London was not a single settlement, but rather that it\nconsisted of an agglomeration of separate communities each with their\nown identity.14 During the nineteenth century there was increasing\n11\n On the nineteenth<entury labour market see: P.

These perceptions inevitably influenced decisions about where\npeople worked and lived.\nThe areas in which Jaques lived were mainly to the north and east of\nthe City, focusing on Islington, Mile End, and the expanding suburban\ndistrict of Forest Gate (West Ham). The population of a borough like\nIslington grew rapidly in the nineteenth century from 10,212 in 1801 to\n95329 in 1851, and 319,143 in 1891. It was thus comparable in population\nto the major provincial cities of England (for instance, Sheffield had a\npopulation of 324,000 in 1891 and at this date only five English provincial {\ncities exceeded the population of Islington).16 Throughout much of this\narea housing densities were high, with most families living in closely\npacked terraces, often in rooms in a large house occupied by several\nfamilies.17 The worst districts included zones in which Charles Booth\nestimated that over 60 per cent of the population lived in poverty, and\ncontained neighbourhoods with some of the worst reputations in the\ncity,18 though in the northern part of Islington only 20 per cent were in\npoverty according to Booth's criteria.19\nThe expanding residential suburb of West Ham (which included\nForest Gate) grew even faster than Islington in the second half of the\nnineteenth century. In 1851 it was only a little over a third of the size of\nIslington, with a population of 34,395, but by 1891 it had mushroomed to\n365,134, exceeding the population of Islington and all but four of\nEngland's provincial towns, and larger than the Scottish capital Edin-\nburgh.20 Most housing in Forest Gate was thus relatively new and\ninitially consisted of better quality terraces and low density villas; but\nStedman-Jones, Outcast London; D.J.

This paper is based mainly\nHenry Jaques, shirtmaker in Victorian London 153\ntypescript version covering ninety-eight pages - and his motives for\nwriting the account seem straightforward. In his introduction he writes:\nFor very many years it had occurred to me that some such record as this should\nbe written to be handed down to my dear dear children, and perused by them\nwhen the hand which writes it is still in the tomb.28\nInevitably some parts of the manuscript are fuller than others, and\nmore detail is given for earlier periods of his life when he kept a detailed\ndaily diary:\nA diary was kept for many years, and full use thereof will be made for the\nfollowing pages. But life's duties becoming more onerous as the years fled by, the\ndaily Diary had to go, not without many regrets.. .29\nLater stages of his life are dealt with more briefly, but he still records key\nevents in considerable detail, together with more reflective comments on\nhis life. The accuracy of the diary can be checked by cross-referencing\nkey life events with information in the records of the Registrar General,\ncensus enumerators' books, and other contemporary sources. Where this\nhas been done the life history has been shown to provide a detailed and\naccurate record.30\nThere are many general problems associated with the use of sources\nsuch as this. First, it can be suggested that any individual who kept a\nregular diary and compiled a life history for the consumption of his\nfamily was atypical of the majority of ordinary Victorian men and\nwomen. We should question the motives as to why he should want to\nrecord his life, whether there were particular aspects that he was keen to\nstress at the expense of other evidence, and the extent to which the\nliteracy and leisure time which made it possible for him to record his life\nhistory separated him from his contemporaries. It should also be stressed\nthat, even assuming the intention of the author was to write an accurate\nand genuine account of his life (as did seem to be the case with Henry\nJaques), the record that is provided will have been filtered through the\neyes of time, and some detail will have been lost or distorted by selective\nmemories. This problem is no greater than dealing with most other\nmanuscript sources, or with oral evidence, but it should be borne in\nmind when interpreting the written record. Furthermore, the interpreta-\ntion placed on the life history will be further filtered through the\nperceptions of the researchers. This paper is inevitably a selective\ninterpretation of evidence available in the life history.

His\nfather, Auguste Jaques, was a Swiss watchmaker who emigrated to\nLondon in 1828. Here he married Eliza Barber who came from Sandwich\nin Kent. His wife died following the birth of her first child, and Auguste\nthen married Eliza's elder sister. The Jaques were living in the Islington\narea of London where Auguste was working as a watchmaker when\nHenry was born into the family in 1842, the second of seven children to\nbe born to his mother between 1840 and 1852. Henry attended a Dame\nSchool and, for two years (1853-54), Barnsbury National British School.\nHe records that he enjoyed school and regretted leaving at the age of 12\nto begin work as an errand boy. Details of Henry's career and residential\nmoves as an adult are examined in detail below. In total he had some 21\ndifferent occupations and moved 31 times during his lifetime, 26 of these\nmoves occurring after he left home in 1858 (at the age of 16) to be\napprenticed to a draper. Henry Jaques married Lizzie Bidwell in 1864\nand they had a total of fourteen children between 1865 and 1888. The life\nhistory ends in 1900, but Henry lived until 1907 when he died at his\nhome in Forest Gate at the age of 65.\nHome and workplace for a young single man in East London\nMigration decisions are closely related to age and life-cycle stage. For the\nfirst twelve years of his life Henry Jaques was a dependent member of\nhis household and moved five times with his family to houses in and\naround Islington in north London (Table 1, Figures 1 and 2). Although it\nwas not unusual for a 12-year-old boy to leave home to be apprenticed to\na trade in the 1850s, the intention of the Jaques family was eventually to\napprentice Henry to the watchmaking business of his father. Henry thus\nremained at home, largely dependent on his parents, when he left school\nin 1854. He was not immediately apprenticed to the watchmaking trade\ndue to financial problems at home, and instead he took a position as an\nerrand boy to an hourglass maker. This was a financial decision by the\n31\n J. Marshall (ed.), The Autobiography of William Stout of Lancaster (Manchester, 1967);\nJ. Burnett, Useful Toil (London, 1974); R. Lawton and CG.

His initial wage as an errand boy was 5s (25p) per week of\nwhich he was allowed to keep 3d (1.2p). He was well received in his first\njob, his wage was soon increased to 6s (30p) per week, and in addition he\nearned a further l\/6d (7.5p) per week helping a cheesemonger on a\nSaturday evening. After six months Henry moved to a better position\nrunning errands for a chronometer maker, and making 7s (35p) per week\n(of which he kept 4d (1.7p)). It seems likely that both these positions\nwere secured through contacts which his father had as a watchmaker.\nThroughout this period Henry lived at home and his journey to work\nwas short and on foot, as his work was close to his home in Islington.\nHowever, his errands regularly took him into the City and other parts of\nLondon.\nAs a 13-year-old child Henry had quite a protected life in that he still\nlived at home and his needs were provided for (albeit substantially from\nmoney he contributed to the household). His immaturity is emphasized\nby the events which led to his discharge from the chronometer makers in\n1855. In his own words:\nI rather disgraced myself here by loitering about when sent home with goods\nand it was really too bad. I was often gone 3 hours to a city journey when one\nshould suffice and at last I mended my ways and went to the other extreme. I\ntook to running all the way there and back, climbing on the backs of cabs and\nomnibuses, until in my anxiety to hasten and through running I lost an important\nand expensive piece of work, which led to my discharge.32\nHe was then apprenticed to his father to learn the watchmaking trade,\nand thus worked at home under close parental control, although he\nadmits to continuing to loiter, stopping to play marbles with friends, and\nto losing some packages when sent on errands by his father to the City.\nWhat comes through most clearly is that, although in full-time employ-\nment and given some responsibility, he was still very much a child in the\nprocess of growing up.\nHenry continued with his father for three years, but with decreasing\ninterest in the work\nI loyally stuck to the work but through it all I felt it was not to be my line of\nbusiness, I did not like the confinement and application. I was very fond of the\ndetail of the work, but continually felt I should like to jump up and rush about at\nsomething. I wanted to be more active.33\nIn May 1858, Henry's father recognised that his son, by now aged 16,\nwas not cut out to be watchmaker, and he was apprenticed to a draper in\nCrosby Row, Southwark. This was the same firm that Henry's elder\nJ'life star\/, 14.\n33\n Ibid., 16.\nTa\nble\n \n1: \nSu\nmm\nar\ny o\nf ch\nan\nge\ns o\nf ho\nme\n \nan\nd w\nor\nk fo\nr H\nen\nry\n \nJa\nqu\nes,\n

Very many boys in East London would\nhave begun their careers in similar ways, working in some branch of the\nclothing trade based on home working, small workshops and retail\nbusinesses.34As an apprentice he lived with his employers (sleeping in a\nsmall bed in the corner of his master's bedroom) and returned home to\nsee his parents every Sunday. Although less than four kilometres from\nhis parental home, the move took him south of the Thames and his\nmother was not entirely happy about him leaving home:\nI cannot say that parting from those at home caused me any great sorrow. I felt\nmost for my mother - and she felt my going away acutely. As for me I was full of\nanticipation.35\nAfter a trial of one month he was indentured for three years without\nsalary, but with pocket money of 2s per week 'if I was a good boy'.36\nWorking hours were long and, as a 16 year old, Henry had very little\nfreedom or spare time to pursue his own interests.\nHenry Jaques served almost half his apprenticeship, and 'took to the\ntrade',37 before he was abruptly dismissed on suspicion of stealing stock.\nAccording to his account he was innocent of all intent to steal, the\nincident was simply a misunderstanding, but he had left himself open to\nsuspicion and, despite protestations, he was dismissed and 'left upon\nmy beam ends without a character'.38 He then returned to his parents'\nhome for some three months. His father tried to persuade him to return\nto the watch trade, but Henry would not do this. He helped his father by\nrunning messages, earned some money doing odd jobs for various\npeople he knew, and taught himself carpentry. Eventually, through the\ngood offices of his half-brother, he secured a position as an 'improver' at\na small outfitters at a salary of \u00a312 per annum.\nHe now changed employers frequently through a combination of his\ndissatisfaction with the work, his employers' dissatisfaction with him,\nand the effects of poor trade. At times he was quite fussy about where he\nwent, leaving one employer after only a week in 1863 because 'It was a\nmiserable home, bad food, an hypocritical master, morning prayers and\nnothing in the life to back it up . . ,'39 and forming clear views on the\nrelative desirability of the retail trade in different localities,40 most\nclearly articulated in 1860: 'This was the second of the two offers I had\npreviously had, but \"pride\" said don't go to the Boro, that low locality -\n34\n Morris, Women Workers; Schmiechen, Sweated Industries; Mudie-Smith, Sweated Industries.\n35\n 'Life s t a r \/ , 21.\n36\n Ibid.\n37\n Ibid., 24\n38\n Ibid., 25.\n39\n Ibid., 40\nSee Schmeichen, Siveated Industries, ch. 1. Also Hall, Industries of London; Stedman Jones,\nOutcast London.\n40\nHenry Jaques, shirtmaker in Victorian London 161\nthe \"West of London\" sounds better\/41 Between February 1860 and April\n1864 he had no fewer than seven different positions in the retail and\nwholesale drapery trade, progressing from an 'improver' through\n'third', 'second' and 'first' hand to the post of assistant. Each time he\nchanged posts he had a few weeks of unemployment, which he spent at\nhis parents' home (they moved house several times but remained in the\nsame area of Islington) and nearness to his parental home was an\nimportant consideration when he was seeking employment. For instance\nin 1861 he writes: 'I was out of a berth over a month, chiefly because I\nwas waiting to secure one near home again'42 and although in each post\nhe lived with his employer, his ability to maintain close contact with his\nparents was clearly important: This shop was near home. I was able in\n10 minutes to reach my home, which I often did after closing, for I loved\nmy home, poor as it was.'43 Although on three occasions he did move\noutside the East End (to Pimlico, Marylebone and Brompton), he quickly\nreturned to a more familiar area.\nWorking conditions in the retail and wholesale drapery trade were\nlong and, as an assistant earning \u00a350 per annum with an employer in\nBrompton Road in 1863, Henry Jaques was regularly working from 8 in\nthe morning until 10 at night. Although now 21 years old, his life\nremained severely restricted by his employers and living conditions\nwere spartan. For instance, whilst at Brompton Road he shared a bed\nwith a more junior hand with whom, fortunately, he got on well. He\nnotes that there was little time for activities outside work, though he\ncontinued to visit his parental home every Sunday. During this period he\nalso met his future wife whilst delivering magazines for the local chapel\n(he had a fluctuating relationship with religion). They were married in\n1864 and this forced a reappraisal of both his living and working\narrangements.\nFor some ten years, between the ages of 12 and 22, Henry had been in\nemployment, talcing at least twelve different posts and living in as many\nplaces. However, although he moved frequently it was clearly important\nthat he remained in contact with his home area of London. Throughout\nthis period he lived with his employers, thus his journey to work was\nnon-existent, but proximity to his parents' home remained important. He\nvisited his parents almost every Sunday and on some evenings, and\nlived with them for several weeks when he was between posts. The\nfrequent changes in work were partly precipitated by bad luck and a\npoor choice of employer, but they also reflected Henry's character. He\nseemed unwilling to settle to any one task for a long period and was\nconstantly trying to improve himself without ever quite taking the right\ndecision. Thus in one sense he was quite adventurous, he often initiated\n41\n ' l i fe story*, 41.\n42\n JWd.,28.\n43\n Ibid.,27.\n1\n162 Urban History\nchange, and from time to time sought to improve himself both through\neducation and religion. However, despite these characteristics his\nteenage years were in many ways highly constrained. He was closely\ncontrolled by a series of employers and by his parents, he had little free\ntime, limited money and, by late twentieth-century standards, few\nopportunities.\nThe impact of marriage on choice of home and workplace\nAlthough Henry Jaques had been making decisions about his employ-\nment and the location of his workplace for the previous ten years, his\naccommodation had followed automatically from whatever work he\nhad. Impending marriage meant that he now had to assume a greater\ndegree of responsibility and independence to ensure both a regular\nincome and a home for his wife and the family that could be expected to\nfollow. In fact, his decisions when to marry, where to live and what\nemployment to take were all very closely interrelated. Henry clearly\nwished to marry reasonably quickly, but could not envisage how he\nmight provide for a wife:\nI was now formally 'engaged' to lizzie, and . . . I began to look to the future. I\nhad certainly saved some money, and felt joy in so doing, if only in view of\nmaking a home for the one I loved, but the total amount was so small that the\nconsummation of this desire seemed very remote.44\nHenry sought advice from a Mr Isaac who had been manager of the\nshirt department at one of the wholesalers for whom Henry had worked.\nEventually, this friend offered to contribute sufficient capital to enable\nHenry Jaques to set up on his own account as a retail draper and hosier.\nThis was the solution that Jaques had been hoping for, but without the\nsupport of Mr Isaac he would have been unable to achieve it. As Henry\nputs it in his diary:\none day I called upon him [Mr Isaac] and he asked me how much money I had\nsaved and whether I should like to go into business for myself in the retail. I told\nhim I had saved nearly \u00a340 and should indeed like to start on my own account,\nbut my capital would not suffice. I had for long been thinking how little a\nbusiness could be started upon and thought that to do this was the only way by\nwhich I could make a home for my Lizzie. This was my object when I left the\nBoro. and which I planned and worked for.45\nMr Isaac offered up to \u00a3150 at 5 per cent interest to add to Henry's own\nmoney to provide sufficient capital to start a business, but it was not\nwithout some trepidation that Henry Jaques accepted the offer\n\u00ab* Jfeii.,43.\n*5 Jfc\/i.,45.\nHenry Jaques, shirtmaker in Victorian London 163\nI did not rush at this proposal, but took two full weeks to consider i t . . .\nWhile writing this I feel amazed at my self confidence at that time - barely 22\nyears of age - and agreeing to go into business.46\nHenry was clearly prepared to move almost anywhere in London to\nachieve his aim of a home and retail business:\nI cast about to find a spot suitable for operations and compatible with my capital.\nI perambulated all over and around London until at last 275 Mile End Road was\ndecided upon. The rent was \u00a355 per annum upon lease for 21 years.47\nHis choice was in fact less than five kilometres from his home area in\nIslington and he consulted his step-brother (who was in the same trade)\nand another former employer about the suitability of the position. Mile\nEnd was to become the Jaques' home area for the next 13 years (see Table\n1, Figures 1 and 3). The shop was in course of construction and he used\nhis self-taught carpentry skills to equip it with fixtures and fittings. It is\nalso dear that the timing of his marriage was fixed to enable the couple\nto run the business together and thus avoid employing an assistant:\nThen it was thought that a more trustworthy assistant than a stranger would be\nfound in a wife, also that the added cost of the one would not be more, or much\nmore, than the other (?). **\nThey married on 27 April 1864 and spent a ten-day honeymoon\nstaying with his aunt at her home in Shorne (Kent). During this period\nHenry made several trips to London to complete the fitting out of the\nshop and purchase stock, and the shop opened for business on 6 May.\nMoney was very tight and Henry worried about his ability both to\nprovide for his wife and succeed in business. He writes:\nWe returned to our new 'home' a few days before the opening day. The furniture\ndid not take us long to arrange. We made a poor show, just the very barest of\nnecessities. My poor dear Lizzie was - I could see - disappointed, but she said\nbut little. All the money available had to go into the business leaving little to\nfurnish with. We had all the large furniture on hire, and it took us 15 months to\nclear off.\nI have since thought that, though it was a happy time to us, in one sense, still the\nterrible worry and anxiety, and foreboding of the future, tended to take the keen\nedge off our pleasure. After I had started upon the new task I was not happy in it\nand often wished myself in a situation again.49\nHenry's forebodings about entering the retail trade on his own\naccount were borne out by later events. Five months after his marriage\n46\n Ibid.\n47\n ibid.\n48\n Ibid., 46.\n49\n Ibid., 47.\n164 Urban History\n27\n24\nLIMEHOUSE\n#21 Home (and workplace)\n21 \u00ab-^-\u00bb22 Residential move\n(see Table 1 for key)\nB\nN\n1 km\nN\nFOREST\nGATE\n1 km\n\u202228 Home (and workplace)\n28 *\u2022\u2022*\"\u2022 29 Residential move\n(see Table 1 for key )\nFigure 3: Details of residential moves undertaken by Henry Jaques in\nMile End and Limehouse (1864-77) and in Forest Gate (1877-1907)\nSource: l ife story of Henry Jaques'\nHenry Jaques, shirtmaker in Victorian London 165\nhe was taken ill with rheumatic fever, the effects of which he felt\nthroughout the rest of his life. He was ill for about a month, during\nwhich time his pregnant wife nursed him and ran the shop single-\nhanded. He then travelled to his aunt's at Doncaster to convalesce for\ntwo weeks before returning to work. Inevitably the business had been\nneglected during his illness, but thereafter takings began to rise and the\nJaques sublet part of their house to increase their income. However, by\nthe summer of 1866 the couple were in serious financial difficulties:\nMany a time when the day came to take up a bill I found myself several pounds\nshort and more than once had to seek the aid of the Pawnbroker for the time\nbeing.50\nMr Isaac offered to help by providing more capital to cover the debts\nand Henry Jaques entered into a financial arrangement which was\neventually to lead to his downfall. Isaac would take responsibility for all\noutgoings, but all receipts would also be banked in his name and he\ncharged 5 per cent for all money imported into the business. Writing\nretrospectively Jaques says:\nit seems a marvel that anyone in his senses would agree to such terms, which\nvirtually amounted to 5% per week for the use of the money. It would not be\npossible to have me thus now - but I was in a tight corner and very inexperienced\nin finance, and the desperate position was such that I did not probe into the\nfuture effects of this arrangement.51\nThe high interest being paid to Mr Isaac for his additional loans, together\nwith a continuing lack of capital, meant that the business was doomed.\nHenry was effectively bankrupt, Mr Isaac took over the shop and paid\noff the creditors and Jaques was allowed to continue to live in the\npremises and manage the shop. This Henry agreed to do despite his loss\nof pride and the fact that he considered that Isaac had unlawfully\nextracted \u00a360 from him during the business dealings. His main motive in\nstaying in Mile End Road was the desire to provide a secure home for his\nwife and two young children. In fact, this was short-lived as, without\ninforming Henry, Mr Isaac put the business up for sale. Everything\nexcept personal furniture was sold and, in July 1867, the Jaques moved\nto two rooms in Rectory Square, close to where the shop had been.\nFor several months thereafter, out of necessity, Henry continued to\nwork for Isaac as a stock keeper in a City wholesale drapers some four\nkilometres from his home, but during his period in business he had also\nlearned another skill which was to stand him in good stead in future\nyears, and which also had an influence on future choices of employment\nand residence. In slack periods at the shop he taught himself the skill of\nshirtmaking, by taking apart a shirt in stock, cutting patterns, working\n50\n Ibid., 50.\n51\n Ibid.\n166 Urban History\nout adjustments for different sizes and experimenting with sewing them.\nBy 1866 he was able to write:\nI . . . was eventually... fully competant to cut out any kind of shirt and fit the\nmost awkward customer. I advertised for work-hands and got together a small\nband, sufficient for my special orders, and had a ticket written for the window\n'Shirts made to order and cut on the premises'.52\nBy 1867 he had quite a thriving business, including making large\nquantities of shirts for wholesale as well as special orders for specific\ncustomers, with Mr Isaac putting substantial wholesale business his way.\nThe expansion of this new business also had a substantial effect on his\nhome life, and the demands made upon housing space:\nSewing machines were bought and a room set apart for the work room, dear\nLizzie taking an active and prominant part in all the details, both of us working\nearly and late to help on this work which supplemented the profits in the shop.\nAnd thus I was launched as a 'Shirt Manufacturer'.53\nThis additional income was too little and too late to save the Jaques\nfrom bankruptcy in the shop, but it did mean that they had an alternative\nsource of income when they fell on hard times. Thus whilst living at\nRectory Square, immediately after being evicted from the shop but still\nin the employ of Mr Isaac, Henry combined his work as stock keeper in a\nwholesale drapers with shirtmaking, leading to long hours but a reason-\nable income:\nMy duties were to keep stock, execute orders from all parts of the country, and\nafter 6 o\/c take home to the London customers orders which had accumulated.\nSometimes there were too many to carry and I had to hire a wagonette and drive\nround. And then after reaching home, sometimes as late as 8 or 9 o\/c, would\nbegin 'cutting out' until 12 o\/c in the morning. My home business had increased\nsomewhat, and, with care, my salary in the City (25\/-) was supplemented by\n10\/-to 12\/-per week.54\nIn his early married life Henry Jaques's home and workplace con-\ntinued to be closely entwined. From living on the premises as an\nemployee, he became proprietor of a small retail business, which meant\nthat the security of his home was tied up with the fortunes of his\nbusiness, a common experience in the retail trade.55 Even after his\nbusiness collapsed, and he was forced to take work in the City (a journey\nto work of only some four kilometres), he continued also to work from\nhome at the self-taught trade of shirtmaking He was thus part of the East\nEnd sweated clothing trade, though as a small employer rather than a\n52\n Jbid.,52.\n* Ibid.\n55\n M.

Shaw, The role of retailing\nin the urban economy', in Johnson and Pooley, Structure of Nineteenth Century Cities,\n171-94.\nHenry Jaques, shirtmaker in Victorian London 167\nsweated worker.56 This pattern of activity was to dominate the rest of his\nlife as decisions about where to live were closely tied into the relative\nsuccess and demands of work both within and outside the home.\nChanging home and workplace with a growing family\nThe economic demands of supporting a growing family, and the space\nneeds associated with more children, are usually key factors in decisions\nabout employment and residence during the family-building phase of\nthe life cycle.57 Henry and Lizzie Jaques had a total of fourteen children\nbetween 1865 and 1888, with a maximum of ten living at home at any\none time. In addition his parents joined the household for a period in the\n1880s (when most of the children were still at home), and the home-\nbased shirtmaking business - an essential supplement to his salary - also\ntook up considerable space. Residential choice thus required a trade-off\nbetween relatively low cost, proximity to work in the retail or wholesale\nclothing trade, and sufficient space to accommodate a large family and\nhome-based shirtmaking. Between 1867 and 1907 Henry and Lizzie lived\nin a further eleven houses and Henry worked for four different\nemployers in a variety of capacities (Table 1, Figures 1 and 3). The\nadjustments in both employment and housing that were a feature of his\nearly life continued to be important as his family grew and circum-\nstances changed.\nAfter only six weeks in the two rooms at Rectory Square, the Jaques\nmoved round the corner to White Horse Lane in September 1867 where\nthey rented more rooms specifically to provide additional space for\nshirtmaking. Henry saw this as a period not of absolute poverty, but of\nconsiderable deprivation:\nOur bread was sure, but beyond this there were deprivations which we cannot\nenumerate. It was a fight, and a hard one.58\nNot surprisingly, Henry Jaques severed his association with Isaac as\nsoon as he could find alternative employment, and early in 1868 he\nentered into an engagement with a shirt manufacturer whom he knew\nfrom previous employment:\nMy duties were to cut out and make the shirts (at home). This was done in the\nearly morning and after 4 o\/c p.m., the intervening hours being occupied in\ntravelling, soliciting orders for the goods we were making.59\nHe thus continued the pattern of combining the apparent security of\n56\n Morris, Women Workers, ch. 6; Schmiechen, Sweated Industries; Mudie-Smith, Sweated\nIndustries.\n57\n Rossi, Why Families Move; Champion and Fielding, Migration Processes and Patterns,\n165-87.\n58\n ' l ife story*, 54.\n59\n Ibid., 55.\n168 Urban History\nemployment by a wholesale firm with home working. His salary at this\ntime was 30s per week which, given that he would now have less\nopportunity to make shirts on his own account, was probably a little less\nthan his previous total income. This level of income would have placed\nHenry Jaques just above the largest category of workers that Charles\nBooth identified in East London: those in Class E with regular earnings\nof 27s to 30s per week. Of these workers Booth commented that with\nlarge families they were not lifted far above the poverty level, but that\nfew were 'very poor'.60 This fits quite closely with Henry Jaques's own\nappraisal of his struggle to make ends meet.\nThe precariousness of employment in the London clothing trade is\nillustrated by the fact that later in 1868 Henry Jaques was once more\nforced to seek new employment:\nI found it a stupendous task to solicit orders for a small unknown house . . . so\nthat it was finally decided to close it This was not so serious a matter to Mr.\nPhillips as to me. He was the case of a wealthy sponge merchant, while I was\nagain upon my beam ends.61\nHaving been let down by employers on several occasions, Henry Jaques\nnow decided to concentrate on his home-based shirtmaking, and to\nsolicit business from the City on his own account. He gained a number of\nsubstantial accounts, and rapidly required more space to carry out this\nbusiness: 'Lodgings were of no use for this, so we took a house No. 5\nHenry St. Rhodeswell Rd. Limehouse, where we had more room\/62\nHowever, despite moving, he remained in the same part of London,\nclose to family and friends and able to exploit a familiar business and\nsocial community. Given that he was now manufacturing entirely on his\nown account, access to business contacts was particularly vital. In the\nsame year he moved to another house in the same locality, again to\nprovide more space for the increasing family (three children) and home\nwork.\nDuring this period Henry built up particularly good contacts with the\nwholesale merchants, Brown Davis & Co. in the City, who took a large\nproportion of Jaques's output of shirts. Early in 1870 Jaques learned with\nsome dismay that Brown Davis were to commence manufacture of all\ntheir own goods, and the buyer with whom he dealt asked Henry if he\ncould recommend someone to be chief shirt cutter in their new depart-\nment. With some hesitation Henry Jaques suggested himself for the\nposition and was eventually taken on in May 1870 at a salary of \u00a3115 per\nyear (plus dinner and tea), and with the possibility of also continuing his\nown home working if he wished.

Henry was himself initially nervous about his new position, as\nhe had not cut special orders for some years, but he made a good\nimpression and satisfied his employers. This chance opening was to\nprovide the most stable period of employment in Henry Jaques's life, as\nhe remained with the same firm for fourteen years.\nEarly in 1871 the Jaques (now with four children) moved to Blomfield\nRoad, Bow, remaining in the same part of London, but beginning to\nestablish a pattern of moving slightly further from the city centre.\nHowever, Henry's employment in the City, to which he almost certainly\nalways walked, kept the family well within the densely populated urban\narea. The combination of working as a shirt cutter in the City and at\nhome meant that Henry was working long hours, leaving home at 6.30\na.m. and returning home by 7.00 p.m. He would then have his own\noutworkers to deal with, and spent most of the evening and often late\ninto the night at his own cutting board. His wife took responsibility for\ntaking orders and forwarding goods connected with the home working.\nWork left little time for other activities and the 'monotony of our daily\nlife was broken only by illness and births'.63 There were substantial\nnumbers of both.\nThe Jaques' family income must now have been substantial by the\nstandards of many of London's poorer residents: in 1873 he earned at\nleast \u00a3155 per annum from his main employment,64 plus income from a\ngrowing home-based shirtmaking business which included outworkers\nand a small machine room. In contrast, a survey of average wages in St\nGeorge's-in-the-East in 1887 showed that even skilled workers such as\ncarpenters and wheelwrights rarely earned more than 30s per week and\nmany unskilled workers earned less than 20s.65 In 1889 Charles Booth\nfixed his basic poverty level for a small family at 21s per week and in the\nearly twentieth century a woman employed in the sweated shirtmaking\ntrade of East London could expect to earn little more than 5s per week as\na home worker.66 This was the sort of person that Henry Jaques\nemployed to sew the shirts that he had cut out at home. However,\ndespite this relatively high income Jaques complained both of poverty\nand, less surprisingly, overwork. In 1872 they moved a short distance\nagain and he states:\nWith our five children we were compelled to have a larger house than my\nincome warranted and the fight became very hard indeed - money would go out\n63\n Ibid., 60.\n64\n Though skilled cutters in a West End bespoke tailors could earn considerably more.

The work people had to be paid every week, but sometimes\nI had to wait weeks for the payment of my City accounts.67\nAlthough his home working was succeeding\/ he was suffering the cash\nflow problems of many small businesses. He also acknowledges that life\nwas hard for his wife:\nBut if it was hard for me, it was harder for the dear one. She had her home duties\nto perform, the machine room to superintend, besides doing some of the work.\nMy heart often ached to see her dear wan face when she came in to see me at the\nboard to wish me good night.68\nIn 1873 Henry gained unexpected promotion at Brown Davis, being\noffered the position of chief buyer and manager for the section of the\ndepartment concerned with shirts, collars, shirtings and all linen goods\nwith his salary increased to \u00a3205 per annum. In 1875 he was given\ncontrol of the whole department with a further increase in salary. He\nnow had a very responsible position, he travelled widely on business to\nplaces such as Manchester, Glasgow and Belfast, but worried about the\nfinances of his department, continued with his home working and still\ncomplained of relative poverty in relation to his growing family:\nWe had no annual holidays then - 1 always had my two weeks at B.D. & Co. but\nwe seldom did more than go for daily trips. The children were all too young, and\nmy purse too scanty to take them all away, so the holiday was more often, then,\noccupied in work at home.69\nHowever, despite these protestations the Jaques family was clearly\nprospering and in 1877 considered a rather longer residential move than\nthey had previously attempted. The immediate reason for moving to the\nsuburbs was for the health of the family, but such a move must also have\nbeen a reflection of the growing affluence and status of Henry Jaques. He\nexplains the move in some detail, and leaving the area in which he had\nlived for so many years must have been something of a wrench:\nThe health of my dear one and of the children was such that it was put into my\nheart to try and arrange to remove to a suburb of London.\nThe doctor was always in the house to one or another and, after mature thought\nand prayer, it was ultimately resolved that we should look out for a house away\nfrom these dense districts.\nVery many families were leaving the district for the more salubrious air of\nLeytonstone and Forest Gate. These two Hamlets then were little more than\nvillages. We were led to seek a house in the latter locality. It seemed a very\ngigantic business, but when once we were resolved the matter was followed up,\nand eventually we decided upon a small house at 28 Bignold Rd. at a rent of \u00a328\n67\/lifestor\/,60.\n68\n Ibid., 61.\n69\n Ibid., 67.\nHenry Jaques, shirtmaker in Victorian London 171\nper annum, where we removed in July 1877 and thus began our connexion with\nForest Gate which was destined to be both happy and lasting.70\nThe move took Henry almost ten kilometres from his workplace in the\nCity, presumably necessitating commuting by public transport (a tram\nline running directly from the edge of the City to Stratford, close to his\nhome, had opened in 1870,71 though its use is not explicitly mentioned),\nbut he was less than six kilometres from his previous residences around\nthe Mile End Road and could easily maintain contact with family and\nfriends whilst enjoying the advantages of a more suburban environment.\nContact with the area of London in which he had previously lived\ncontinued for some time as in 1880 he notes that:\nWe kept our membership at the East London Tab, for some years, attending at\nleast monthly on the first Sunday for communion. Between times we attended\nthe Forest Lane Congregational Chapel.. T2\nThe household at the time of the move included seven children and both\nof Henry's parents who had joined them due to ill health in 1876.\nHenry's feelings towards this extension of his household were ambiva-\nlent:\nFor many years the tax upon us was great, and we felt the loss of the room with\nour still increasing family, but I was brought to see that what I was doing was my\nduty.. P\nDespite moving to a more suburban location, the Jaques continued to\nmove home frequently, adjusting their housing to both demands for\nspace and their income. In total the family undertook a further five\nmoves in the suburbs (see Table 1 and Figure 3), typified by the\nexperience of 1879 when they rented 5 Macdonald Villas, Forest Gate:\n' . . . a quaint house, but roomy, and cheap, this latter qualification being\nthe chief reason for our removing from Bignold Road'.74 Despite\nincreasing prosperity and a more suburban lifestyle, Henry Jaques\ncontinued with his home-based shirtmaking. The income provided was\ndeemed essential, though clearly he had increasing aspirations which\nnecessitated expenditure, especially on his children's education:\nMy home work assumed important proportions while here and supplemented\nmy City salary considerably. Were it not for this it would have been impossible\nfor us to have met all demands, nor to bring up the dear young ones in such a\nmanner as to be fitted for the battle of life.75\nHe also made good use of the additional space at Macdonald Villas,\nn\n Ibid., 69-70.\n71\n Barker and Robbins, London Transport, 183-190.\n72\n T i fe story', 73\n73\n Ibid.,71.\n74\n Ibid.,72.\n75\n Ibid.\n172 Urban History\nkeeping poultry in the garden - which he found to be 'a profitable\ninvestment'76 - and building a separate outhouse (chiefly using dis-\ncarded material from an old warehouse which was demolished by the\nCity firm for whom he worked) to use as a cutting room.\nIn 1884\/ at the age of 42, the job insecurity which had dominated\nHenry's earlier life returned to him at a time when he would be likely to\nfind it increasingly difficult to compete in the labour market, and he also\nhad considerable outgoings associated with a suburban home and a\nhousehold consisting of ten children and two dependent parents living\nat home. Brown Davis, the City firm for whom he had worked for\nfourteen years, were clearly in decline and Henry wisely decided to\nleave before it collapsed. He took the position of sales representative\nwith a small shirt manufacturer in Wood Street, a post secured through\nexisting contacts in the shirt trade, and negotiated a profit-sharing\ncontract which should have secured at least the income which he had\npreviously enjoyed. Feeling secure in his employment the Jaques again\nmoved house in Forest Gate:\nto 28 Sebert Rd., a more comfortable house. The rent was more, but our prospects\nseemed then so good that we felt we were justified in making the change.77\nHowever, once again things did not turn out as Henry had anticipated.\nDespite his considerable efforts as a travelling salesman the company\ndid not succeed and he clearly had a serious personality clash with\nanother employee of the firm. In 1886, and with some trepidation, Henry\nJaques decided to cut his losses and leave despite having a relatively\nuncompetitive position in the labour market:\nSo, at the age of 44,1 had to cast about and begin life afresh. But where, or\nhow??78\nSometimes I was well nigh miserable, I pictured a season of poverty and misery\nfor the dear ones. The market was inundated with 'young men'. Old ones were at\na discount. It was then, as now, experience counted for little. Cheapness of labour\nwas the great ideal of employers.79\nIn the event Henry was unnecessarily despondent. His experience,\nand especially his business contacts did count for something, and he was\nvery quickly offered a position as commercial traveller for a good\nwholesale hosiery firm (Dent Allcroft, 97 Wood Street), with the specific\ntask of securing new business in the suburbs of London. Henry's initial\nsalary was \u00a325 less per annum than he had previously been earning, and\nhe began his new job with considerable foreboding relating both to the\ndifficulty of acquainting himself with a much wider range of stock than\n76\n ibid., 63.\n77\n Ibid.,78.\n78\n Ibid., BO.\n79\n Ibid.,81.\nHenry Jaques, shirtmaker in Victorian London 173\nhe had previously been used to, and the task of securing business in\nunknown suburbs of the metropolis. Henry Jaques was successful in his\nwork: in his first seven months employment he secured 179 new\naccounts for the company, but at considerable cost. He travelled long\ndistances with a heavy bag of samples and his health, which had not\nbeen good since his attack of rheumatic fever, suffered considerably. He\nalso continued to supplement his income with home working which\nplaced a further strain upon him:\nno one will ever know what the next seven months meant to me physically. The\ndaily effort, involving long tedious walks between the many short drives by bus\nand train, the heavy weight of the bag, sometimes supplemented by a parcel in\naddition, the long and earnest talking to would-be customers, tiring in itself, and,\nwhen I arrived home, often and often at 8,9 and sometimes 10 o\/c tired out, but\nonly to have a snatch of a supper and then go to the cutting board for an hour or\ntwo.80\nAfter several short periods of sickness, in January 1887 he was taken\nseverely ill with bronchitis and pleurisy for four weeks, followed by two\nweeks convalescence in Bournemouth. Fortunately his employers\nwished to retain his services and recognized that the work was too\nstrenuous. They increased his salary and arranged for him to have a\nbrougham in which to travel around London with his samples. Henry\ncontinued to be a successful commercial traveller and stayed with the\nsame firm until his death in 1907. His relative prosperity and job security\nwas also reflected in a move to 'a larger and more comfortable house'81\nat Hamfrith Road in the same locality of London, where he was still\nliving when the life history was compiled in 1901. The family moved\ntwice more in the Forest Gate area in 1902 and 1905.\nThe final years of the life history generate few entries of interest. The\nfamily seemed settled to a suburban life of relative prosperity, but it was\nstill interlaced with illness (Lizzie had a serious attack of tuberculosis in\n1891) and with other family crises, mostly relating to their children. In\nsummary, Henry's married life consisted of a constant adjustment of his\nemployment and home situations. Although relatively successful and\nprosperous, life was not without its hardships, and his choice of house\nwas determined not only by his income and job prospects, but also by\nproximity to City wholesalers and the availability of sufficient space for\na growing family and home-based shirtmaking. Other influences on his\nlife included the church, his family, and a desire for self-improvement,\nthough at times it is clear that he had little time for anything other than\nwork.\n80\n Ibid.,S4.\n81\n Ibid., 86.\n174 Urban History\nThe wider context\nThere is little point in trying to assess the typicality of a life history such\nas this. Its value lies in the detailed insight which it gives into the way in\nwhich one family adjusted their work and residences to suit changing\ncircumstances. However, many of the processes affecting the Jaques\nwould have influenced other families living in London at the time. The\nuncertainty of work, even for someone with reasonable skills and\neducation, the difficulty of generating enough income to support a\ngrowing family and rising aspirations, the constant threat of illness, the\nease with which families moved between similar rented property, the\nclose ties between home and workplace, the stresses produced by home\nworking, and the attractions of suburbanization for those who could\nafford it were all themes that were common to many families. The case\nstudy of Henry Jaques exemplifies many of these themes particularly\neffectively.\nVery frequent short-distance residential mobility within one locality\nwas a common feature of the migration pattern of many people in the\npast. Using data collected from family historians throughout Britain to\nconstruct a database of 16,091 lifetime residential histories for indivi-\nduals born between 1750 and 1930,82 it has been found that over 38 per\ncent of all moves undertaken had an origin and destination in the same\nsettlement. For moves with an origin in the County of London in the\nperiod 1840-1919 no fewer than 72.3 per cent had a destination in the\nmetropolis. The pattern of intra-urban mobility within the County of\nLondon in the period 1840 to 1899 formed a complex web of moves,\npicking out the structure of separate neighbourhoods within London.\nJaques's moves were typical of this wider pattern, but his removal to the\nresidential suburb of Forest Gate eventually took him outside the County\nof London and into Essex.\nAs was the case with Henry Jaques, most intra-urban moves in the\ndatabase collected from family historians were for a combination of\nemployment, family and housing reasons. For all moves undertaken\nbetween 1840 and 1919 with an origin and destination in the same\nsettlement, 31.5 per cent were undertaken for housing reasons, 25.0 per\ncent on marriage, 23.5 per cent for work-related reasons and 10.4 per\ncent for other family reasons or in response to personal crises. However,\nas the example of Henry Jaques has shown, such a simple classification\nof migration reasons is misleading, because employment, housing and\nfamily stimuli for movement were often closely linked together.\n82\n Collected as part of a research project on the longitudinal analysis of individual\nresidential histories, supported by ESRC research grant R000234638. For further details\nof the data set, methodology and selected results see CG. Pooley and J. Tumbull,\n'Migration and urbanization in North-West England: a reassessment of the role of towns\nin the migration process', in D. Siddle (ed.), Migration, Mobility and Modernization in\nEurope (Liverpool, forthcoming 1997).\nHenry Jaques, shirtmaker in Victorian London 175\nAlthough Jaques moved more frequently than most people (the average\nnumber of lifetime moves undertaken by individuals in the family\nhistory database born between 1840 and 1899 was 5.3), in other respects\nthe experience of Henry Jaques seems typical of wider experience and\nstresses the complex interrelationships of employment and life-course\nfactors in stimulating migration.\nThe process of suburbanization occurred more rapidly in London than\nin any other British city,83 but even in the metropolis the distances over\nwhich most people travelled to work remained relatively short.84 Evi-\ndence from the family history database of lifetime residential histories\nsuggests that the journey to work changed only slowly in the nineteenth\ncentury, and that it was not until after the First World War that the ties\nbetween home and workplace were broken, and improved urban trans-\nport systems linked to rising real incomes allowed longer-distance\ncommuting for large numbers of people.85 Thus, although longer than in\nother parts of the country, the mean journey to work for those employed\nin London was only around five kilometres in the nineteenth century,\nwhereas it doubled in the first thirty years of the twentieth century\n(Table 2). Professional workers on higher incomes had the longest\njourneys to work, but in the period 1850 to 1899 professional workers in\nLondon still only travelled on average 6.9 km. from their home to their\nworkplace. In contrast, skilled manual and craft workers travelled just\n3.1 km. Those living within the County of London had especially short\njourneys to work, for instance residents of East London (where Henry\nJaques lived) on average travelled only 2.2 km. from their home to their\nworkplace in the period 1850-99. In contrast, those that lived outside\nLondon but worked in the metropolis had a mean journey to work of\n33.5 km. in the same period. The relatively restricted world in which the\nJaques lived and worked was thus common to many London families in\nthe second half of the nineteenth century. In the later, more affluent,\nstages of his life Jaques's journey to work was well above the average for\nall workers in London, but considerably lower than the mean for all\nthose who lived outside the County of London but worked in the\nmetropolis.\nLondon was notable for the persistence of home working, especially in\nthe East End clothing trade in which Jaques worked. It is estimated that\nthere were over 100,000 home workers in London in 1900,86 often living\nand working in cramped and potentially dangerous conditions and\nearning as little as 4s to 8s per week.87 These were the workers that\nJaques employed in his home-based shirtmaking, and who provided\n83\n Jackson, Semi-Detached London; Thompson, Rise of Suburbia; Dyos Victorian Suburb.\n84\n Dyos, 'Workmen's fares'; Green, 'Distance to work in Victorian London'.\n85\n Lawton, 7oumey to work in England and Wales'; Wames, lourney to work distances'.\n86\n Schmiechen, Sweated Industries; Morris, Women Workers.\n87\n Mudie-Smith, Sweated Industries.\n176 Urban History\nTable 2: Changes in the journey to work in Britain\n1750-1799\n1800-1849\n1850-1899\n1900-1929\n1930-1959\n1960+\nTotal sample size\n2.6\n5.1\n4.4\n10.8\n21.0\n37.2\n4,957\nMean journey to work (km)\nDate Workplace in London All workplaces\n1.7\n1.9\n2.5\n4.3\n7.2\n14.5\n18,891\nSource: Data collected from family historians (see note 82)\nmany of the products which he sold in his other activities. Such working\npractices were clearly linked into an advanced capitalist economy as\nhome workers were supplying large wholesale merchants who distrib-\nuted goods throughout Britain and overseas. However, such production\nsystems were a far cry from the organized 'Fordist' systems of large-scale\nfactory production which had already emerged in some industrial\nsectors by the mid-nineteenth century, and which dominated British and\nEuropean manufacturing industry in the first half of the twentieth\ncentury.88\nThe advantages of such production practices were that they lowered\noverhead costs for merchants and manufacturers who did not have to\ninvest capital in their own workshops, and the flexible working arrange-\nments meant that workers could change jobs easily and maximize their\nincome in an uncertain labour market. The downsides of this system\nwere the low wages and harsh working conditions experienced by many,\nand the uncertainty of employment with home workers not knowing\nfrom day to day whether their services would be needed by large City\nwholesalers.89\nHenry Jaques was better off than many London workers, but clearly\nsaw his home-based shirtmaking as an essential supplement to his\nincome in the City. He clung to this work even when he was reasonably\nprosperous and living in a suburban location. It can be suggested that\nfor people like Henry Jaques, home working also became a way of life.\n88\n D.
