M. Howe1 and C. J. Maxwell2\nCentre for Particle Theory, University of Durham\nSouth Road, Durham, DH1 3LE, England\nAbstract\nWe suggest that for Minkowskian QCD observables such as the Re+e\u2212 ra-\ntio, all-orders perturbation theory, and the resummed all-orders non-perturbative\nOperator Product Expansion (OPE), can remain separately well-defined for\nall values of energy\n\u221a\ns, with the perturbative contribution dominating as\ns \u2192 \u221e and as s \u2192 0. In the infrared s \u2192 0 limit the perturbative cor-\nrection to the parton model result for Re+e\u2212 smoothly freezes to the value\nR(0) = 2\/b, where b = (33 \u2212 2Nf)\/6 is the first QCD beta-function coeffi-\ncient, with Nf flavours of massless quark. For freezing one requires Nf < 9.\nThe freezing behaviour is manifested by the \u201cContour-improved\u201d or \u201cAna-\nlytic Perturbation Theory\u201d(APT), in which an infinite subset of analytical\ncontinuation terms are resummed to all-orders. For Euclidean quantities a\nwell-defined version of all-orders perturbation theory can only be obtained\nby augmenting perturbation theory with an all-orders resummation of OPE\nterms. We perform phenomenological comparisons of suitably smeared low-\nenergy data for the Re+e\u2212 ratio, with the perturbative freezing predictions,\nand find good agreement.\n1email:d.m.howe@durham.ac.uk\n2email:c.j.maxwell@durham.ac.uk\n1\n1 Introduction\nIn this paper we wish to address the question of whether QCD perturbation\ntheory can be used to make predictions in the low-energy infrared regime\nwhere one expects non-perturbative effects to dominate. Such an extension\nof the applicability of perturbation theory beyond the ultraviolet regime of\nAsymptotic Freedom, would obviously enable one to test QCD in new ways.\nWe will focus our discussion on the Re+e\u2212(s) ratio, at c.m. energy\n\u221a\ns. This\nis a Minkowskian quantity derived by analytical continuation from the Eu-\nclidean QCD vacuum polarization function. The corrections to the parton\nmodel result for Re+e\u2212(s) will consist of a perturbative part, which can be\ndeveloped as a power series in the renormalized QCD coupling a(s)\u2261\u03b1s(s)\/\u03c0,\nand a non-perturbative part which can be developed as an Operator Product\nExpansion (OPE) in powers of \u039b2\/s, the first term corresponding to the low-\nest dimension relevant operator, the gluon condensate, being proportional to\n(\u039b2\/s)\n2\n. The key point is that the combination of the all-orders perturba-\ntion series and OPE must be well-defined at all values of s, since Re+e\u2212(s)\nis a physical quantity. Each part by itself, however, exhibits pathologies.\nSpecifically, the perturbation series exhibits n! growth in the perturbative\ncoefficients, at large-orders n. Attempts to define the all-orders sum of the\nperturbation series using a Borel integral run into the difficulty that there\nare singularities on the integration contour termed infrared renormalons [1].\nIt turns out, however, that the resulting ambiguity in defining the Borel in-\ntegral is of the same form as ambiguities in the coefficient functions involved\nin the OPE, and so choosing a particular regulation of the Borel integral\n(such as principal value) induces a corresponding definition of the coeffi-\ncient functions, and the sum of the two components is well-defined [1, 2].\nThere is a further crucial pathology of the Borel integral, which we shall\nrefer to as the \u201cLandau divergence\u201d. This means that at a critical energy\ns = sL, the Borel integral diverges. It should be stressed that the value of\nsL should not be confused with the \u201cLandau pole\u201d or \u201cLandau ghost\u201d in\nthe QCD coupling a(s). The \u201cLandau ghost\u201d is completely unphysical and\nscheme-dependent, whereas the divergence of the Borel integral is completely\nscheme-independent [1]. For Minkowskian quantities such as Re+e\u2212 there is\nan oscillatory factor in the Borel transform in the integrand, arising from the\nanalytical continuation from Euclidean to Minkowskian, which means that\nthe Borel integral is finite at s = sL, and diverges for s < sL. To go to lower\nenergies than sL we shall show that one needs to modify the form of the Borel\n2\nintegral, the modified form now having singularities on the integration con-\ntour corresponding to ultraviolet renormalons, correspondingly to go below\ns = sL one needs to resum the OPE to all-orders and recast it as a modified\nexpansion in powers of s\/\u039b2. One then finds that the ambiguities in regulat-\ning this modified Borel integral, are of the same form as ones in the modified\nOPE, and for s < sL the sum of the two components is again well-defined.\nIn the infrared s\u2192 0 limit the modified OPE contribution involving powers\nof s, necessarily vanishes. The oscillatory factor in the Borel integral means\nthat it freezes smoothly to 2\/b in the infrared, where b = (33\u22122Nf)\/6 is the\nfirst QCD beta-function coefficient, with Nf quark flavours.\nThe arguments sketched above suggest that the all-orders perturbative\nand non-perturbative components for Minkowskian quantities such asRe+e\u2212(s)\ncan separately remain defined at all energies, with the perturbative part being\ndominant in both the ultraviolet and infrared limits. One can then compare\nall-orders perturbative predictions with data, having suitably smeared to av-\nerage over resonances [3] , and approximately included quark mass effects.\nIn practice, of course, we do not have exact all-orders perturbative infor-\nmation. We know exactly the perturbative coefficients of the corrections to\nthe parton model result for Re+e\u2212 to next-next-leading order (NNLO), i.e.\nincluding terms of order \u03b13s [4]. Clearly, conventional fixed-order perturba-\ntion theory for Re+e\u2212 will not exhibit the freezing behaviour in the infra-red\nto be expected for the all-orders perturbation theory. What is required is\na rearrangement of fixed-order perturbation theory which has freezing be-\nhaviour in the infrared. As we have discussed in a recent paper [5] the\nresummation to all-orders of the convergent subset of analytical continua-\ntion terms (\u201clarge-\u03c02\u201d terms) , arising when the perturbative corrections to\nthe Euclidean Adler-D(\u2212s) function at a given order are continued to the\nMinkowskian Re+e\u2212(s), recasts the perturbation series as an expansion in a\nset of functions An(s) which are well-defined for all values of s, vanishing as\ns\u2192\u221e in accord with Asymptotic Freedom, and with all but A1(s) vanishing\nin the infrared limit, with A1(s) approaching 2\/b to provide infrared freez-\ning behaviour to all-orders in perturbation theory. This \u201ccontour-improved\u201d\nperturbation theory (CIPT) approach is equivalent to the Analytic Perturba-\ntion Theory (APT) approach of Shirkov and collaborators for Minkowskian\nquantities [6]. We gave explicit expressions for the functions An(s). At the\ntwo-loop level these can be expressed in terms of the Lambert W-function\n[7, 8]. To make contact with the all-orders perturbative result represented as\n3\na Borel integral, we note that the CIPT\/APT reorganisation of perturbation\ntheory corresponds to leaving the oscillatory factor in the Borel transform\nintact whilst expanding the remaining factor as a power series. Integrating\nterm-by-term then yields the functions An(s). The presence of the oscillatory\nfactor in these integrals guarantees that the An(s) are well-defined at all ener-\ngies. The CIPT\/APT series should thus be asymptotic to the Borel integral\nat both ultraviolet and infrared energies. Whilst a reorganised fixed-order\nperturbation series exhibiting stable infrared freezing behaviour is possible\nfor Minkowskian quantities, we shall show that it is not possible for Eu-\nclidean observables. In the Euclidean case the Borel integral is divergent at\ns = sL, the oscillatory factor now being absent. Since the combination of\nthe Borel integral and the resummed OPE must be finite at s = sL, there\nmust exist an infinite subset of terms in the OPE which when resummed\ncancel the Landau divergence of the Borel integral. Reshuffling these terms\nbetween perturbation theory and the OPE then gives modified perturbative\nand OPE components which are separately finite at s = sL.\nThe plan of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we shall describe the\nCIPT\/APT reorganisation of fixed-order perturbation theory for Re+e\u2212, re-\nviewing the results of Ref.[5]. In Section 3 we consider how for Minkowskian\nobservables one can define all-orders perturbation theory, and the all-orders\nnon-perturbative OPE in such a way that each component remains well-\ndefined at all energies. The link between the all-orders perturbative result\nand the reorganised CIPT\/APT fixed-order perturbation theory is empha-\nsised. We then briefly consider the corresponding problem for Euclidean ob-\nservables. In Section 4 we perform some phenomenological studies in which\nwe compare low energy experimental data for Re+e\u2212(s) with the CIPT\/APT\nperturbative predictions. Section 5 contains a Discussion and Conclusions.\n2 Infra-red freezing of Re+e\u2212- CIPT\/APT\nWe begin by defining the Re+e\u2212 ratio at c.m. energy\n\u221a\ns,\nRe+e\u2212(s)\u2261\u03c3tot(e\n+e\u2212 \u2192 hadrons)\n\u03c3(e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u00b5+\u00b5\u2212) = 3\n\u2211\nf\nQ2f(1 +R(s)) . (1)\n4\nHere the Qf denote the electric charges of the different flavours of quarks,\nand R(s) denotes the perturbative corrections to the parton model result,\nand has a perturbation series of the form,\nR(s) = a+\n\u2211\nn>0\nrna\nn+1 . (2)\nHere a\u2261\u03b1s(\u00b52)\/\u03c0 is the renormalized coupling, and the coefficients r1 and r2\nhave been computed in the MS scheme with renormalization scale \u00b52 = s\n[4]. We can consider the s-dependence of R(s) at NNLO,\ns\ndR(s)\nds\n= \u2212 b\n2\n\u03c1(R)\u2261\u2212 b\n2\nR2(1 + cR+ \u03c12R2) . (3)\nHere c = (153\u2212 19Nf)\/12b is the second universal QCD beta-function coef-\nficient, and \u03c12 is the NNLO effective charge beta-function coefficient [9], an\nRS-invariant combination of r1, r2 and beta-function coefficients. The condi-\ntion for R(s) to approach the infrared limit R\u2217 as s\u2192 0 is for the Effective\nCharge beta-function to have a non-trivial zero, \u03c1(R\u2217) = 0. At NNLO the\ncondition for such a zero is \u03c12 < 0. Putting Nf = 2 active flavours we find\nfor the NNLO RS invariant \u03c12 = \u22129.72, so that R(s) apparently freezes in\nthe infrared to R\u2217 = 0.43. The freezing behaviour was first investigated in\na pioneering paper by Mattingly and Stevenson [10] in the context of the\nPrinciple of Minimal Sensitivity (PMS) approach. However, it is not obvi-\nous that we should believe this apparent NNLO freezing result [11]. In fact\n\u03c12 is dominated by a large b\n2\u03c02 term arising from analytical continuation\n(AC) of the Euclidean Adler D(\u2212s) function to the Minkowskian R(s), with\n\u03c12 = 9.40\u2212 \u03c02b2\/12. Similarly the N3LO invariant \u03c13 will contain the large\nAC term \u22125c\u03c02b2\/12. This suggests that in order to check freezing we need\nto resum the AC terms to all-orders.\nRe+e\u2212 is directly related to the transverse part of the correlator of two\nvector currents in the Euclidean region,\n(q\u00b5q\u03bd \u2212 g\u00b5\u03bdq2)\u03a0(s) = 4\u03c02i\n\u222b\nd4xeiq.x < 0|T [j\u00b5(x)j\u03bd(0)]|0 > , (4)\nwhere s = \u2212q2 > 0. To avoid an unspecified constant it is convenient to take\na logarithmic derivative with respect to s and define the Adler D-function,\nD(s) = \u2212s d\nds\n\u03a0(s) . (5)\n5\nThis can be represented by Eq.(1) with the perturbative corrections R(s)\nreplaced by\nD(s) = a+\n\u2211\nn>0\ndna\nn+1 . (6)\nThe Minkowskian observable R(s) is related to D(\u2212s) by analytical con-\ntinuation from Euclidean to Minkowskian. One may write the dispersion\nrelation,\nR(s) = 1\n2\u03c0i\n\u222b \u2212s+i\u01eb\n\u2212s\u2212i\u01eb\ndt\nD(t)\nt\n. (7)\nWritten in this form it is clear that the \u201cLandau pole\u201d in the coupling a(s),\nwhich lies on the positive real s-axis, is not a problem, and R(s) will be\ndefined for all s. The dispersion relation can be reformulated as an integration\naround a circular contour in the complex energy-squared s-plane [12, 13],\nR(s) = 1\n2\u03c0\n\u222b \u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0\nd\u03b8D(sei\u03b8) . (8)\nOne should note, however, that this is only equivalent to the dispersion rela-\ntion of Eq.(7) for values of s above the \u201cLandau pole\u201d. Expanding D(sei\u03b8) as\na power series in a\u00af\u2261a(sei\u03b8), and performing the \u03b8 integration term-by-term,\nleads to a \u201ccontour-improved\u201d perturbation series, in which at each order an\ninfinite subset of analytical continuation terms present in the conventional\nperturbation series of Eq.(2) are resummed. It is this complete analytical\ncontinuation that builds the freezing of R(s). We shall begin by considering\nthe \u201ccontour-improved\u201d series for the simplified case of a one-loop coupling.\nThe one-loop coupling will be given by\na(s) =\n2\nbln(s\/\u039b\u02dc2\nMS\n)\n. (9)\nAs described above one can then obtain the \u201ccontour-improved\u201d perturbation\nseries for R(s),\nR(s) = A1(s) +\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\ndnAn+1(s) , (10)\nwhere the functions An(s) are defined by,\nAn(s) \u2261 1\n2\u03c0\n\u222b \u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0\nd\u03b8a\u00afn =\n1\n2\u03c0\n\u222b \u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0\nd\u03b8\nan(s)\n[1 + ib\u03b8a(s)\/2]n\n. (11)\n6\nThis is an elementary integral which can be evaluated in closed-form as [5]\nA1(s) =\n2\n\u03c0b\narctan\n(\n\u03c0ba(s)\n2\n)\nAn(s) =\n2an\u22121(s)\nb\u03c0(1\u2212 n)Im\n[(\n1 +\nib\u03c0a(s)\n2\n)1\u2212n]\n(n > 1) . (12)\nWe then obtain the one-loop \u201ccontour-improved\u201d series for R(s),\nR(s) = 2\n\u03c0b\narctan\n(\n\u03c0ba(s)\n2\n)\n+d1\n[\na2(s)\n(1 + b2\u03c02a2(s)\/4)\n]\n+d2\n[\na3(s)\n(1 + b2\u03c02a2(s)\/4)2\n]\n+. . . .\n(13)\nThe first arctan term is well-known, and corresponds to resumming the\ninfinite subset of analytical continuation terms in the standard perturbation\nseries of Eq.(2) which are independent of the dn coefficients. Subsequent\nterms corrrespond to resumming to all-orders the infinite subset of terms in\nEq.(2) proportional to d1, d2, . . ., etc. In each case the resummation is conver-\ngent, provided that |a(s)| < 2\/\u03c0b. In the ultra-violet s\u2192\u221e limit the An(s)\nvanish as required by asymptotic freedom. In the infra-red s \u2192 0 limit, the\none-loop coupling a(s) has a \u201cLandau\u201d singularity at s = \u039b\u02dc2\nMS\n. However,\nthe functions An(s) resulting from resummation, if analytically continued,\nare well-defined for all real values of s. A1(s) smoothly approaches from be-\nlow the asymptotic infra-red value 2\/b, whilst for n > 1 the An(s) vanish.\nThus, as claimed, R(s) is asymptotic to 2\/b to all-orders in perturbation\ntheory. We postpone the crucial question of how to define all-orders per-\nturbation theory in the infra-red region until the next Section. We should\nalso note that the functions An(s) in Eq.(12) can also be obtained by simple\nmanipulation of the dispersion relation in Eq.(7), which is defined for all real\ns. This avoids the possible objection that the contour integral in Eq.(8) is\nonly defined for s above the \u201cLandau pole\u201d.\nBeyond the simple one-loop approximation the freezing is most easily\nanalysed by choosing a renormalization scheme in which the beta-function\nequation has its two-loop form,\n\u2202a(\u00b52)\n\u2202ln\u00b52\n= \u2212 b\n2\na2(\u00b52)(1 + ca(\u00b52)) . (14)\nThis corresponds to a so-called \u2019t Hooft scheme [14] in which the non-\nuniversal beta-function coefficients are all zero. Here c = (153\u2212 19Nf)\/12b\n7\nis the second universal beta-function coefficient. For our purposes the key\nfeature of these schemes is that the coupling can be expressed analytically\nin closed-form in terms of the Lambert W function , defined implicitly by\nW (z)exp(W (z)) = z [15, 16]. One has\na(\u00b52) = \u2212 1\nc[1 +W\u22121(z(\u00b5))]\nz(\u00b5) \u2261 \u22121\ne\n(\n\u00b5\n\u039b\u02dcMS\n)\u2212b\/c\n, (15)\nwhere \u039b\u02dcMS is defined according to the convention of [17] , and is related to\nthe standard definition [18] by \u039b\u02dcMS = (2c\/b)\n\u2212c\/b\u039bMS. The \u201c\u22121\u201d subscript on\nW denotes the branch of the Lambert W function required for Asymptotic\nFreedom, the nomenclature being that of Ref.[16]. Assuming a choice of\nrenormalization scale \u00b52 = xs , where x is a dimensionless constant, for the\nperturbation series of D(s) in Eq.(5), one can then expand the integrand in\nEq.(6) for R(s) in powers of a\u00af \u2261 a(xsei\u03b8) , which can be expressed in terms\nof the Lambert W function using Eq.(14),\na\u00af =\n\u22121\nc[1 +W (A(s)eiK\u03b8)]\n(16)\nwhere\nA(s) =\n\u22121\ne\n(\u221a\nxs\n\u039b\u02dcMS\n)\u2212b\/c\n, K =\n\u2212b\n2c\n. (17)\nThe functions An(s) in the \u201ccontour-improved\u201d series are then given, using\nEqs(15,16), by\nAn(s) \u2261 1\n2\u03c0\n\u222b \u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0\nd\u03b8a\u00afn =\n1\n2\u03c0\n\u222b 0\n\u2212\u03c0\nd\u03b8\n(\u22121)n\ncn\n[1 +W1(A(s)e\niK\u03b8)]\n\u2212n\n+\n1\n2\u03c0\n\u222b \u03c0\n0\nd\u03b8\n(\u22121)n\ncn\n[1 +W\u22121(A(s)e\niK\u03b8)]\n\u2212n\n. (18)\nHere the appropriate branches of the W function are used in the two regions\nof integration. As discussed in Refs.[7, 8], by making the change of variable\nw =W (A(s)eiK\u03b8) we can then obtain\nAn(s) =\n(\u22121)n\n2iKcn\u03c0\n\u222b W\n\u22121(A(s)eiKpi)\nW1(A(s)e\u2212iKpi)\ndw\nw(1 + w)n\u22121\n. (19)\n8\nNoting that W1(A(s)e\n\u2212iK\u03c0) = [W\u22121(A(s)e\niK\u03c0)]\n\u2217\n, we can evaluate the ele-\nmentary integral to obtain for n = 1,\nA1(s) =\n2\nb\n\u2212 1\n\u03c0Kc\nIm[ln(W\u22121(A(s)e\niK\u03c0))] , (20)\nwhere the 2\/b term is the residue of the pole at w = 0. For n > 1 we obtain\nAn(s) =\n(\u22121)n\ncnK\u03c0\nIm\n[\nln\n(\nW\u22121(A(s)e\niK\u03c0)\n1 +W\u22121(A(s)eiK\u03c0)\n)\n+\nn\u22122\u2211\nk=1\n1\nk(1 +W\u22121(A(s)eiK\u03c0))\nk\n]\n.\n(21)\nCrucially the contribution from the poles at w = 0 and w = \u22121 cancel\nexactly. Equivalent expressions have been obtained in the APT approach\n[8]. Provided that b\/c > 0, which will be true for Nf < 9, we find the same\nbehaviour as in the one-loop case with the An(s) vanishing in the ultraviolet\nlimit consistent with Asymptotic Freedom, and with An(s) vanishing in the\ninfrared limit for n > 1, and A1(s) freezing to 2\/b. To the extent that the\nfreezing holds to all-orders in perturbation theory it should hold irrespective\nof the choice of renormalization scheme (RS), The use of the \u2019t Hooft scheme\nsimply serves to make the freezing manifest. In Figures 1-3 we plot the\nfunctions A1(s), A2(s) and A3(s), respectively, as functions of (sx\/\u039b\u02dc\n2\nMS\n).\n9\n0 2 4 6 8 10\nsx\/\u039b2~ MS_\n0.1\n0.15\n0.2\n0.25\nA1(s)\nFigure 1: The function A1(s) of Eq.(20) versus sx\/\u039b\u02dc\n2\nMS\n.

(22)\nThe PT component is formally just the resummed perturbation series of\nEq.(6),\nDPT (Q2) = a(Q2) +\n\u2211\nn>0\ndna\nn+1(Q2) . (23)\nIn addition one has the non-perturbative OPE contribution,\nDNP (Q2) =\n\u2211\nn\nCn(Q\n2, \u00b52) < On(\u00b52) >\nQ2n\n, (24)\nwhere the sum is over the relevant operators On of dimension 2n. \u00b5 denotes\nthe factorization scale, and Cn is the coefficient function. For the Adler D\nfunction the lowest dimension relevant operator is the dimension four gluon\ncondensate,\n< 0|Ga\u00b5\u03bdG\u00b5\u03bda |0 > . (25)\nIt will be convenient to scale out the dimensionful factor \u039b\u02dc2n from the opera-\ntor expectation value, and combine it with the coefficient function to obtain\nthe overall coefficient Cn(Q2, \u00b52). We can then write the DNP (Q2) component\nin the form,\nDNP (Q2) =\n\u2211\nn\nCn\n(\n\u039b\u02dc2\nQ2\n)n\n. (26)\nWe have suppressed the \u00b52 and Q2 dependence of the coefficient Cn. The\ncoefficients are themselves series expansions in a.\nCn = Ka\u03b4n(\u00b52)[1 +O(a)] . (27)\nHere K is an undetermined non-perturbative normalisation, and \u03b4n is the\nanomalous dimension of the operator concerned.\nThe definition of the all-orders perturbative component in Eq.(23) needs\ncare. The series has zero radius of convergence in the coupling a. A direct\nway of seeing this is to consider the large-Nf expansion of the perturbative\ncoefficient dn,\ndn = d\n[n]\nn N\nn\nf + d\n[n\u22121]\nn N\nn\u22121\nf + . . .+ d\n[0]\nn . (28)\n13\nThe leading large-Nf coefficient, d\n[n]\nn , can be computed exactly to all-orders\nsince it derives from a restricted set of diagrams in which a chain of n fermion\nbubbles (renormalon chain) is inserted in the initiating quark loop. Working\nin the so-called V -scheme , which corresponds to MS subtraction with scale\n\u00b52 = e\u22125\/3Q2, one finds the exact large-Nf result [19, 20, 21],\nd[n]n (V ) =\n\u22122\n3\n(n+ 1)\n(\u22121\n6\n)n [\n\u22122n\u2212 n + 6\n2n+2\n+\n16\nn+ 1\n\u2211\nn\n2\n+1>m>0\nm(1\u2212 2\u22122m)(1\u2212 22m\u2212n\u22122)\u03b62m+1\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fbn! . (29)\nThe n! growth of coefficients means that the perturbation series is at best\nan asymptotic one. To arrive at a function to which it is asymptotic one can\nuse a Borel integral representation, writing\nDPT (Q2) =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ndze\u2212z\/a(Q\n2)B[D](z) . (30)\nHere B[D](z) is the Borel transform, defined by,\nB[D(z)] =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\nzndn\nn!\n. (31)\nOn performing the Borel integral term-by-term one reconstructs the divergent\nformal perturbation series for DPT . If the series for the Borel transform has\nfinite radius of convergence, by analytical continuation to the whole region\nof integration one can then define the Borel Sum, provided that the Borel in-\ntegral exists. On general grounds [22, 23] one expects that in renormalisable\nfield theories the Borel Transform will contain branch point singularities on\nthe real axis in the complex z plane, at positions z = zk\u22612kb corresponding\nto infrared renormalons, IRk, k = 1, 2, 3, . . ., and at z = \u2212zk corresponding\nto so-called ultraviolet renormalons, UV k. Here b is the first beta-function\ncoefficient, so that for QED with Nf fermion species, b = \u221223Nf , whilst for\nSU(3) QCD with Nf active quark flavours, b = (33\u2212 2Nf)\/6. Thus in QED\nthere are ultraviolet renormalon singularities on the positive real axis, and\nhence the Borel integral will be ambiguous. In QCD with Nf < 33\/2 flavours,\nso that the theory is asymptotically free, and b > 0, there are infrared renor-\nmalon singularities on the positive real axis making the Borel integral again\n14\nambiguous. For both field theories all-orders perturbation theory by itself\nis not sufficient. The presence of singularities on the integration contour\nmeans that there is a routing ambiguity depending on whether the contour\nis taken above or below each singularity. It is easy to check that, taking\nD in the Borel integral of Eq.(30) to be a generic QED or QCD observable\nwith branch point singularities (1\u2212 z\/|zk|)\u2212\u03b3k in the Borel plane, the routing\nambiguity for the singularity at z = |zk| is of the form\n\u2206DPT \u223c Ke\u2212|zk|\/a(Q2)a1\u2212\u03b3k , (32)\nwhere K is complex. Using the one-loop form for the coupling, a(Q2) =\n2\/bln(Q2\/\u039b\u02dc2), one finds that in the QCD case,\n\u2206DPT\u2248Ka1\u2212\u03b3k\n(\n\u039b\u02dc2\nQ2\n)k\n. (33)\nThis has exactly the same structure as a term in the OPE expansion, Eq.(26),\nand one sees that the branch point exponent \u03b3 of the IR renormalon is re-\nlated to the anomalous dimension of the operator, with \u03b4k = 1\u2212\u03b3k. The idea\nis that the coefficient, Ck, in particular the constant K, is ambiguous in the\nOPE because of non-logarithmic UV divergences [24, 25]. This ambiguity can\nbe compensated by the IR renormalon ambiguity in the PT Borel integral,\nand so regulating the Borel integral, using for instance a principal value (PV)\nprescription, induces a particular definition of the coefficient functions in the\nOPE, and the PT and OPE components are then separately well-defined.\nThat this scenario works in detail can be confirmed in toy models such as\nthe non-linear O(N) \u03c3-model [24, 26]. For the QED case the ambiguity cor-\nresponds to a Q2\/\u039b\u02dc2 effect. So that all-orders QED perturbation theory is\nonly defined if there are in addition power corrections in Q2. Such effects are\nonly important if Q2\u223c\u039b\u02dc2, here \u039b\u02dc corresponds to the Landau ghost in QED,\n\u039b\u02dc2 \u223c 10560m2, with m the fermion mass. Thus in QED such power cor-\nrections can have no phenomenological consequences and can be completely\nignored.\nOur exact information about the Borel transform, B[D](z), for the QCD\nAdler D function is restricted to the large-Nf result of Eq.(29). In QCD we\nexpect large-order behaviour in perturbation theory of the form dn\u2248Kn\u03b3(b\/2)nn!,\ninvolving the QCD beta-function coefficient b = (33\u22122Nf )\/6. Motivated by\n15\nthe structure of renormalon singularities in QCD one can then convert the\nNf expansion into the so-called b-expansion [27, 28, 29, 30], by substituting\nNf = (33\/2\u2212 3b) to obtain,\ndn = d\n(n)\nn b\nn + d(n\u22121)n b\nn\u22121 + . . .+ d(0)n . (34)\nThe leading-b term d\n(L)\nn \u2261d(n)n bn is then used to approximate dn. Since d(L)n =\n(\u22123)nd[n]n bn, it is known to all-orders from the large-Nf result. This approach\nis sometimes also referred to as \u201cNaive Nonabelianization\u201d [27]. It can be\nmotivated by considering a QCD skeleton expansion [31], and corresponds\nto simply taking the first \u201cone-chain\u201d term in the expansion. It does not\ninclude the multiple exchanges of renormalon chains needed to build the full\nasymptotic behaviour of the perturbative coefficients, and there are no firm\nguarantees as to its accuracy. The leading-b result for the Borel transform of\nthe Adler-D function in the V -scheme can then be obtained from Eq.(29).\nB[D(L)](z) =\n\u221e\u2211\nj=1\nA0(j) + zA1(j)\n(1 + z\nzj\n)2\n+\nB0(2)\n(1\u2212 z\nz2\n)\n+\n\u221e\u2211\nj=3\nB0(j) + zB1(j)\n(1\u2212 z\nzj\n)2\n, (35)\nso that one sees in the leading-b limit a set of single and double pole renor-\nmalon singularities at the expected positions. The residues of the UV j poles,\nA0(j) and A1(j), are given by [28]\nA0(j) =\n8\n3\n(\u22121)j+1(3j2 + 6j + 2)\nj2(j + 1)2(j + 2)2\nA1(j) =\n4\n3\nb(\u22121)j+1(2j + 3)\nj2(j + 1)2(j + 2)2\n. (36)\nBecause of the conformal symmetry of the vector correlator [32] the IRj\nresidues, B0(j) and B1(j), are directly related to the UV j ones, with B0(j) =\n\u2212A0(\u2212j) and B1(j) = \u2212A1(\u2212j) for j > 2. B0(1) = B1(1) = B1(2) = 0, and\nB0(2) = 1. Notice the absence of an IR1 renormalon singularity. This is\nconsistent with the correspondence between OPE terms and IR renormalon\nambiguities noted above, since there is no relevant operator of dimension 2\nin the OPE. The singularity nearest the origin is then the UV 1 singularity\nat z = \u22122\/b, which generates the leading asymptotic behaviour,\nd(L)n \u2248\n(12n+ 22)\n27\nn!\n(\u2212b\n2\n)n\n. (37)\nWe shall now consider the correction, R(s), to the parton model result\nfor Re+e\u2212. This may be split into a perturbative component RPT (s), and\n16\nan OPE component RNP (s), analogous to Eqs.(23),(24). Inserting the Borel\nrepresentation for DPT of Eq.(30) into the dispersion relation of Eq.(7) one\nfinds the representation\nRPT (s) = 1\n2\u03c0i\n\u222b \u2212s+i\u01eb\n\u2212s\u2212i\u01eb\ndt\nt\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ndze\u2212z\/a(t)B[D](z) . (38)\nIt will be convenient to consider the all-orders perturbative result in leading-\nb approximation to start with, in which case the coupling a(t) will have its\none-loop form, a(t) = 2\/bln(t\/\u039b\u02dc2V ), where we assume the V -scheme. In this\ncase the t integration is trivial and one finds,\nR(L)PT (s) =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ndze\u2212z\/a(s)\nsin(\u03c0bz\/2)\n\u03c0bz\/2\nB[D(L)](z) , (39)\nwhere B[D(L)](z) (in the V -scheme) is given by Eq.(35). It is now possible\nto explicitly evaluate R(L)PT (s) in terms of generalised exponential integral\nfunctions Ei(n, w), defined for Rew > 0 by\nEi(n, w) =\n\u222b \u221e\n1\ndt\ne\u2212wt\ntn\n. (40)\nOne also needs the integral\u222b \u221e\n0\ndze\u2212z\/a\nsin(\u03c0bz\/2)\nz\n= arctan\n(\n\u03c0ba\n2\n)\n. (41)\nWriting the \u2018sin\u2019 as a sum of complex exponentials and using partial frac-\ntions one can then evaluate the contribution to R(L)PT (s) coming from the UV\nrenormalon singularities, i.e. from the terms involving A0(j) and A1(j) in\nEq.(35) [28]\nR(L)PT (s)|UV =\n2\n\u03c0b\n(\n8\u03b62\n3\n\u2212 11\n3\n)\narctan\n(\n\u03c0ba(s)\n2\n)\n+\n2\n\u03c0b\nj=\u221e\u2211\nj=1\n(A0(j)\u03c6+(1, j) + (A0(j)\u2212 A1(j)zj)\u03c6+(2, j)) ,(42)\nwhere \u03b62 = \u03c0\n2\/6 is the Riemann zeta-function, and we have defined\n\u03c6+(p, q)\u2261ezq\/a(s)(\u22121)qIm[Ei(p, (1\/a(s)) + i\u03c0bzq\/2)] . (43)\n17\nTo evaluate the remaining contribution involving the IR renormalon singu-\nlarities we need to regulate the integral to deal with the singularities on\nthe integration contour. For simplicity we could choose to take a principal\nvalue prescription. We need to continue the Ei(n, w) defined for Rew > 0\nby Eq.(40), to Rew < 0. With the standard continuation one arrives at a\nfunction analytic everywhere in the cut complex w-plane, except at w = 0;\nwith a branch cut running along the negative real axis. Explicitly [33]\nEi(n, w) =\n(\u2212w)n\u22121\n(n\u2212 1)!\n[\n\u2212lnw \u2212 \u03b3E +\nn\u22121\u2211\nm=1\n1\nm\n]\n\u2212\n\u2211\nm=0\nm6=n\u22121\n(\u2212w)m\n(m\u2212 n+ 1)m! , (44)\nwith \u03b3E = 0.5722. . . Euler\u2019s constant. The lnw contributes the branch cut\nalong the negative real w-axis. To obtain the principal value of the Borel\nintegral one needs to compensate for the discontinuity across the branch cut,\nand make the replacement Ei(n, w)\u2192 Ei(n, w) + i\u03c0sign(Imw). This leads\none to introduce, analogous to Eq.(43),\n\u03c6\u2212(p, q) \u2261 e\u2212zq\/a(s)(\u22121)qIm[Ei(p, (\u22121\/a(s))\u2212 i\u03c0bzq\/2)]\n\u2212 e\n\u2212zq\/a(s)(\u22121)qzp\u22121q\n(p\u2212 1)! \u03c0Re[((1\/a(s)) + i\u03c0b\/2)\np\u22121] . (45)\nThe principal value of the IR renormalon contribution is then given by [28]\nR(L)PT (s)|IR =\n2\n\u03c0b\n(\n14\n3\n\u2212 8\u03b62\n3\n)\narctan\n(\n\u03c0ba(s)\n2\n)\n+\n2B0(2)\n\u03c0b\n\u03c6\u2212(1, 2)\n+\n2\n\u03c0b\n\u221e\u2211\nj=3\n(B0(j)\u03c6\u2212(1, j) + (B0(j) +B1(j)zj)\u03c6\u2212(2, j)) .(46)\nThe perturbative component is then the sum of the UV and (regulated) IR\ncontributions,\nR(L)PT (s) = R(L)PT (s)|UV +R(L)PT (s)|IR\n=\n2\n\u03c0b\narctan\n(\n\u03c0ba(s)\n2\n)\n+\n2\n\u03c0b\n\u221e\u2211\nj=1\n(A0(j)\u03c6+(1, j) + (A0(j)\u2212 A1(j)zj)\u03c6+(2, j))\n+\n2B0(2)\n\u03c0b\n\u03c6\u2212(1, 2) +\n2\n\u03c0b\n\u221e\u2211\nj=3\n(B0(j)\u03c6\u2212(1, j) + (B0(j) +B1(j)zj)\u03c6\u2212(2, j)) .(47)\n18\nNote that the \u03b62 contributions cancel, and one obtains the arctan term, which\nis the leading contribution, A1(s), in the CIPT\/APT reformulation of fixed-\norder perturbation theory. The connection between the Borel representation\nand the An(s) will be further clarified later.\nWe now turn to the infrared behaviour of the regulated Borel integral.\nIn the one-loop (leading-b) case the V -scheme coupling a(s) becomes infinite\nat s = sL\u2261\u039b\u02dc2V . The e\u2212z\/a(s) term in the Borel integrand approaches unity\nat s = sL, but the trigonometric factor sin(\u03c0bz\/2)\/(\u03c0bz\/2) ensures that the\nintegral is defined at s = sL. For s < sL, however, a(s) becomes negative,\nand the e\u2212z\/a(s) factor diverges at z = \u221e, the Borel transform in the V -\nscheme does not contain any exponential z-dependence to compensate, so\nthe Borel integral is not defined. We shall refer to this pathology of the\nBorel integral at s = sL as the \u201cLandau divergence\u201d. It is important to\nstress that the Landau divergence is to be carefully distinguished from the\nLandau pole in the coupling. The Landau pole in the coupling depends on\nthe chosen renormalization scale. At one-loop choosing anMS scale \u00b52 = xs,\nthe coupling a(xs) has a Landau pole at s = \u039b\u02dc2\nMS\n\/x, the Borel integral of\nEq.(39) can then be written in terms of this coupling as,\nR(L)PT (s) =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ndze\u2212z\/a(xs)\nsin(\u03c0bz\/2)\n\u03c0bz\/2\n[xe5\/3]\nbz\/2\nB[D(L)](z) . (48)\nIn a general scheme the Borel transform picks up the extra factor [xe5\/3]\nbz\/2\nmultiplying the V -scheme result. The Borel integrand is scheme (x) invariant.\nThe extra factor has to be taken into account when identifying where the\nintegral breaks down, and one of course finds the Landau divergence to be\nat the same x-independent energy, s = sL = e\n5\/3\u039b\u02dc2\nMS\n= \u039b\u02dc2V . Thus the Borel\nrepresentation of Eq.(38) for R(L)PT (s) only applies for s\u2265sL. For s < sL the\none-loop (V -scheme) coupling a(s) becomes negative. We can rewrite the\nperturbative expansion of RPT (s) as an expansion in (\u2212a(s)),\nRPT (s) = a(s) + r1a2(s) + r2a3(s) + . . .+ rnan+1(s) + . . .\n= \u2212[(\u2212a(s))\u2212 r1(\u2212a(s))2 + r2(\u2212a(s))3 + . . .+ (\u22121)nrn(\u2212a(s))n+1 + . . .] .(49)\nThe expansion in (\u2212a(s)) follows from the modified Borel representation\nRPT (s) = \u2212\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ndze\u2212z\/(\u2212a(s))B[R](\u2212z)\n19\n=\u222b \u2212\u221e\n0\ndzez\/(\u2212a(s))B[R](z) . (50)\nThis modified form of Borel representation will be valid when Re(a(s)) <\n0, and involves an integration contour along the negative real axis. Thus,\nit is now the ultraviolet renormalons UV k which render the Borel integral\nambiguous. The ambiguity in routing around these singularities (analogous\nto Eq.(33)) now involves (s\/\u039b\u02dc2)\nk\n. Of course it is now unclear how these\nambiguities can cancel against the corresponding OPE ambiguities. The key\npoint is that since only the sum of the PT and OPE components is well-\ndefined, the Landau divergence of the Borel integral at s = sL, must be\naccompanied by a corresponding breakdown in the validity of the OPE as an\nexpansion in powers of (\u039b\u02dc2\/s), at the same energy. The idea is illustrated\nby the following toy example, where the OPE is an alternating geometric\nprogression,\nRNP (s) =\n(\n\u039b\u02dc2\ns\n)\n\u2212\n(\n\u039b\u02dc2\ns\n)3\n+\n(\n\u039b\u02dc2\ns\n)5\n\u2212 . . .\n=\n\u039b\u02dc2\ns\n1 + \u039b\u02dc\n4\ns2\n=\ns\n\u039b\u02dc2\n1 + s\n2\n\u039b\u02dc4\n=\n(\ns\n\u039b\u02dc2\n)\n\u2212\n(\ns\n\u039b\u02dc2\n)3\n+\n(\ns\n\u039b\u02dc2\n)5\n\u2212 . . . . (51)\nAt any value of s, RNP (s) is given by the equivalent functions in the middle\nline. For s > \u039b\u02dc2 these have a valid expansion in powers of \u039b\u02dc2\/s, the standard\nOPE, given in the top line. For s < \u039b\u02dc2 the standard OPE breaks down, but\nthere is a valid expansion in powers of s\/\u039b\u02dc2 given in the bottom line. Thus\nfor s < sL, the OPE should be resummed and recast in the form,\nRNP (s) =\n\u2211\nn\nC\u02dcn\n(\ns\n\u039b\u02dc2\n)n\n. (52)\nThe terms present in this modified OPE should then be in one-to-one corre-\nspondence with the UV n renormalon singularities in the Borel transform of\nthe PT component, and the PT renormalon ambiguities can cancel against\ncorresponding OPE ones, and again each component separately be well-\ndefined. The modified coefficients C\u02dcn will have a form analogous to Eq.(27),\nC\u02dcn = Ka\u03b4\u02dcn(\u00b52)[1 +O(a)] . (53)\n20\nThe anomalous dimension is that of an operator which can be identified using\nthe technique of Parisi [22]. The anomalous dimension corresponding to C\u02dc1\nfor the Adler D function has been computed [34]. The routing ambiguity\nfor the modified Borel representation of Eq.(50), taking UV k to be a branch\npoint singularity (1\u2212 z\/zk)\u03b3\u02dck , is\n\u2206RPT\u2248Ka1\u2212\u03b3\u02dck\n(\ns\n\u039b\u02dc2\n)k\n. (54)\nComparing with Eq.(53) one finds \u03b4\u02dck = 1\u2212 \u03b3\u02dck. The modified Borel represen-\ntation for R(L)PT valid for s < sL will be,\nR(L)PT (s) = \u2212\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ndze\u2212z\/(\u2212a(s))B[R(L)](\u2212z) . (55)\nThis may again be written explicitly in terms of Ei(n, w) functions. One\nsimply needs to change a(s) \u2192 \u2212a(s), zj \u2192 \u2212zj , and A1(j) \u2192 \u2212A1(j),\nB1(j)\u2192 \u2212B1(j) in Eq.(47). One finds that the result of Eq.(47) is invariant\nunder these changes, apart from the additional terms which we added to the\nEi(n, w) in continuing from Rew > 0 to Rew < 0, in order to obtain the\nprincipal value. In fact the PV Borel integral is not continuous at s = sL.\nContinuity is obtained if rather than the principal value we use the standard\ncontinuation of the Ei(n, w) defined by Eq.(44). That is we redefine\n\u03c6\u2212(p, q)\u2261e\u2212zq\/a(s)(\u22121)qIm[Ei(p, (\u22121\/a(s))\u2212 i\u03c0bzq\/2)] . (56)\nThis simply corresponds to a different regulation of singularities. We then\nsee that Eq.(47) for R(L)PT (s) is a function of a(s) which is well-defined at\nall-energies, and freezes to 2\/b in the infra-red. We note that the branch of\nthe arctan changes at s = sL, so that its value smoothly changes from zero\nat s = \u221e to \u03c0 at s = 0. The reformulated OPE of Eq.(52) means that\nthe R(L)NP (s) component vanishes as s\u21920, and so the perturbative component\ndominates in the infrared and in the ultraviolet. The key message is that\nboth components can be described by functions of s which are well-defined at\nall energies. The apparent Landau divergence is a pathology of the particular\nrepresentations, Borel integral and OPE series, which are used to describe\nthem, which have a limited range of validity in s. The connection with the\nCIPT\/APT rearrangement of fixed-order perturbation theory is now clear.\nIt is obtained by keeping the sin(\u03c0bz\/2)\/(\u03c0bz\/2) term in the Borel transform,\n21\nand expanding the remainder in powers of z. Ordinary fixed-order perturba-\ntion theory, of course, corresponds to expanding the whole Borel transform\nin powers of z. The retention of the oscillatory sin factor in the Borel trans-\nform ensures that the reformulated perturbation theory remains defined at\nall energies. One then finds that for s\u2265sL,\nAn(s) =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ndze\u2212z\/a(s)\nsin(\u03c0bz\/2)\n\u03c0bz\/2\nzn\u22121\n(n\u2212 1)! , (57)\nwhere the one-loop An(s) are given by Eqs.(12). Similarly for s\u2264sL one finds\nAn(s) =\n\u222b \u2212\u221e\n0\ndzez\/(\u2212a(s))\nsin(\u03c0bz\/2)\n\u03c0bz\/2\nzn\u22121\n(n\u2212 1)! . (58)\nThus the CIPT\/APT fixed-order result should be an asymptotic approxima-\ntion to the Borel integral at both large and small values of s. In Fig.4 we\ncompare the all-orders leading-b result for R(L)PT (s) given by Eq.(47), with the\nNNLO CIPT\/APT prediction,\nR(L)APT (s) = A1(s) + d(L)1 A2(s) + d(L)2 A3(s) . (59)\nThe one-loop An(s) are given by Eqs.(12) and as in Eq.(47) the V -scheme\nis assumed. We assume Nf = 2 quark flavours. One sees that there is good\nagreement at all values of s\/\u039b\u02dc2V .\nWe now turn to the full QCD result beyond the one-loop approximation,\nand as in Section 2, it will be sufficient to consider the two-loop result since\none can always use an \u2019t Hooft scheme. Consider the Borel representation\nfor RPT (s) of Eq.(38). We shall assume that, as in the leading-b approxi-\nmation, the Borel transform B[D](z) in the V -scheme does not contain any\nexponential dependence on z, but is simply a combination of branch point\nsingularities. It is then clear that the Landau divergence occurs when the fac-\ntor e\u2212z\/a(\u2212s) becomes a diverging exponential, that is when Re(1\/a(\u2212s)) < 0.\nThus the critical energy sL is given by the condition Re(1\/a(\u2212s)) = 0. At\none-loop level one has\n1\na(\u2212s) =\nb\n2\nln\n(\ns\n\u039b\u02dc2V\n)\n+\ni\u03c0b\n2\n, (60)\nand so the condition yields s = sL = \u039b\u02dc\n2\nV , as we found before. At the two-loop\nlevel the situation is slightly different. Integrating the two-loop beta-function\n22\nin Eq.(14) now gives,\n1\na(\u2212s) + cln\n[\nca(\u2212s)\n1 + ca(\u2212s)\n]\n=\nb\n2\nln\n(\ns\n\u039b\u02dc2V\n)\n+\ni\u03c0b\n2\n. (61)\nThe vanishing of Re(1\/a(\u2212s)) then corresponds to the solution of the tran-\nscendental equation\nRe\n{\ncln\n[\nca(\u2212s)\n1 + ca(\u2212s)\n]}\n=\nb\n2\nln\n(\ns\n\u039b\u02dc2V\n)\n. (62)\nAssuming Nf = 2 flavours one finds s = sL = 0.4574\u039b\u02dc\n2\nV . Since the Borel\nintegral is scheme-invariant so must the value of sL be, in particular the\nbreakdown of the Borel representation would occur in any scheme, not just\nan \u2019t Hooft one. We can perform the t-integration in Eq.(38) in closed form,\nand arrive at the two-loop Borel representation\nRPT (s) = \u22122\n\u03c0b\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ndzIm\n[\ne\u2212z\/a(\u2212s+i\u01eb)\nz\n\u2212 cezcEi\n(\n1, zc +\nz\na(\u2212s+ i\u01eb)\n)]\nB[D](z) .\n(63)\nThe factor in the square bracket plays the role of the e\u2212z\/a(s)sin(\u03c0bz\/2)\/(\u03c0bz\/2)\nfactor in the one-loop case. It provides an oscillatory factor so that at s = sL\nthe Borel representation remains defined. For s < sL one must switch to a\nmodified Borel representation as in Eq.(50), writing\nRPT (s) = \u2212 1\n2\u03c0i\n\u222b \u2212s+i\u01eb\n\u2212s\u2212i\u01eb\ndt\nt\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ndze\u2212z\/(\u2212a(t))B[D](\u2212z) . (64)\nWhich, performing the t-integration gives\nRPT (s) = 2\n\u03c0b\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ndzIm\n[\n\u2212e\n\u2212z\/(\u2212a(\u2212s+i\u01eb))\nz\n\u2212 ce\u2212zcEi\n(\n1,\u2212zc + z\n(\u2212a(\u2212s + i\u01eb))\n)]\nB[D](\u2212z) . (65)\nUnfortunately we cannot write down a function analogous to Eq.(47) which\ngives RPT (s) at all energies, because we do not know B[D](z) exactly. The\ntwo-loop situation, however, is the same as that at one-loop. The regulated\nrepresentation of Eq.(63) applies for s\u2265sL , with the corresponding standard\n23\nOPE. Below s = sL one needs the modified representation of Eq.(65) together\nwith the resummed OPE recast in the form of Eq.(52). The perturbative\ncomponent RPT (s) then freezes to 2\/b in the infra-red, we can see this if\nwe split B[D](\u2212z) into (1 + (B[D](\u2212z) \u2212 1)). The part of the integrand\nproportional to B[D](\u2212z) \u2212 1 vanishes for all z from 0 \u2192 \u221e in the infra-\nred limit. The remaining term integrates to give us A1(s) which freezes\nto 2\/b as s \u2192 0. The non-perturbative component RNP (s) given by the\nreformulated OPE vanishes in the infrared. There is again a direct connection\nwith the CIPT\/APT reformulation of fixed-order perturbation theory. Using\nintegration by parts one can show that that for s\u2265sL\nAn(s) =\n\u22122\n\u03c0b\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ndzIm\n[\ne\u2212z\/a(\u2212s+i\u01eb)\nz\n\u2212 cezcEi\n(\n1, zc +\nz\na(\u2212s + i\u01eb)\n)]\nzn\u22121\n(n\u2212 1)! ,\n(66)\nwhere the An(s) correspond to the two-loop results in Eqs.(20,21). Once\nagain CIPT\/APT corresponds to keeping the oscillatory function in the Borel\ntransform, and expanding the remainder in powers of z. Similarly for s\u2264sL\none has,\nAn(s) =\n2\n\u03c0b\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ndzIm\n[\n\u2212e\n\u2212z\/(\u2212a(\u2212s+i\u01eb))\nz\n\u2212 ce\u2212zcEi\n(\n1,\u2212zc + z\n(\u2212a(\u2212s + i\u01eb))\n)]\n(\u2212z)n\u22121\n(n\u2212 1)! . (67)\nThus, as in the one-loop case, the CIPT\/APT reformulation of fixed-order\nperturbation theory will be asymptotic to the Borel representations at small\nand large energies. We would like, as in Fig.4 for the one-loop case, to com-\npare how well the fixed-order CIPT\/APT perturbation theory corresponds\nwith the all-orders Borel representation. We are necessarily restricted to us-\ning the leading-b approximation since this is the extent of the exact all-orders\ninformation at our disposal. One possibility is to simply use the leading-b re-\nsult for the Borel transform, B[D(L)](z), in the two-loop Borel representation\nof Eq.(63). The difficulty though is that with a(\u2212s) the two-loop coupling,\nthe Borel integral is now scheme-dependent, since B[D(L)](z) has a scale de-\npendence which exactly compensates that of the one-loop coupling. Using\na renormalization scale \u00b52 = xs our result for RPT (s) has an unphysical\nx-dependence. This difficulty is exacerbated if we attempt to match the re-\nsult to the exactly known perturbative coefficients d1 and d2, which we could\n24\n0.0001 0.001 0.01 0.1 1 10 100 1000 10000\n-0.005\n0\n0.005\n0.01\n0.015\ns\/\u039b\u02dc2V\n\u03b4R(s)\nFigure 4: \u03b4R(s) = R(L)PT (s)\u2212R(L)APT (s), at the one loop level for 2 flavours of\nquark.\ndo by adding an additional contribution (d1 \u2212 d(L)1 )z + (d2 \u2212 d(L)2 )(z2\/2) to\nthe Borel transform. Thus, as has been argued elsewhere, such matching of\nleading-b results to exact NLO results, yields completely ad hoc predictions,\nwhich may be varied at will by changing the renormalisation scale [35, 36].\nThe resolution of this difficulty follows if one accepts that the standard RG-\nimprovement of fixed-order perturbation theory is incomplete, in that only\na subset of RG-predictable UV logarithms involving the energy scale s are\nresummed. Performing a complete resummation of these logs together with\nthe accompanying logs involving the renormalisation scale, yields a scale-\nindependent result. This Complete Renormalisation Group Improvement\n(CORGI) approach [37] applied to D(s) corresponds to use of a renormalisa-\ntion scale \u00b52 = e\u22122d\/bs, where d denotes the NLO perturbative correction d1\nin Eq.(23), in the MS scheme with \u00b52 = s. In the CORGI scheme we have\nthe perturbation series,\nD(t) = a0(t) +X2a30(t) +X3a40(t) + . . .+Xnan+10 + . . . , (68)\nwhere a0(t) is given by Eq.(15) with z = (\u22121\/e)(\n\u221a\nt\/\u039bD)\n\u2212b\/c\nwith \u039bD\u2261ed\/b\u039b\u02dcMS,\nand Xn are the CORGI invariants, and only X2 is known. We can then at-\n25\ntempt to perform the leading-b CORGI resummation,\nD(L)CORGI(t) = a0(t) +X2a30(t) +\n\u2211\nn>2\nX(L)n a\nn+1\n0 (t) + . . . , (69)\nso that the exactly known NNLO X2 coefficient is included, with the remain-\ning unknown coefficients approximated by X\n(L)\n3 , X\n(L)\n4 , . . ., the leading-b ap-\nproximations. We stress that a0(t) denotes the full CORGI coupling defined\nin Eq.(15). One can define this formal sum using the Borel representation\nof D in Eq.(30), with the result for B[D(L)] in Eq.(35). The integral can\nbe expressed in closed form in terms of the Exponential Integral functions\nEi(n, w) of Eq.(40), with the result [7]\nD(L)(1\/a(t)) =\n\u221e\u2211\nj=1\nzj{ \u2212 ezj\/a(t)Ei(1, zj\/a(t))[(zj\/a(t))(A0(j)\u2212 zjA1(j))\u2212 zjA1(j)]\n+ (A0(j)\u2212 zjA1(j))} \u2212 e\u2212zj\/a(t)B0(2)Ei(1,\u2212zj\/a(t))\n+\n\u221e\u2211\nj=3\n{ \u2212 e\u2212zj\/a(t)Ei(1,\u2212zj\/a(t))[(zj\/a(t))(B0(j) + zjB1(j))]\n\u2212 (B0(j) + zjB1(j))} . (70)\nTo define the infra-red renormalon contribution we have assumed the stan-\ndard continuation of Ei(n, w) from Rew > 0 to Rew < 0, defined by\nEq.(44). In [7] a principal value was assumed, which corresponds to adding\n\u2212i\u03c0sign(Im(zj\/a(t)) to the Ei(1,\u2212zj\/a(t)) term. As we found for R(L)PT (s)\nthe principal value is not continuous at s = sL, whereas the standard con-\ntinuation is. The formal resummation in Eq.(69) then corresponds to [7],\nD(L)CORGI(t) = D(L)\n(\n1\na0(t)\n+ d\n(L)\n1 (V )\n)\n+ (X2 \u2212X(L)2 )a30(t) , (71)\nonce again a0(t) is the full CORGI coupling, and d\n(L)\n1 (V ) denotes the NLO\nleading-b correction in the V -scheme. Inserting DCORGI(t) inside the disper-\nsion relation of Eq.(7) one can then define,\nR(L)CORGI(s) =\n1\n2\u03c0i\n\u222b \u2212s+i\u01eb\n\u2212s\u2212i\u01eb\ndt\nD(L)CORGI(t)\nt\n. (72)\n26\nThis can be evaluated numerically, if we have R(L)CORGI(s1) then we can obtain\nR(L)CORGI(s2) = R(L)CORGI(s1)+\n1\n2\u03c0i\n(\u222b \u2212s1\u2212i\u01eb\n\u2212s2\u2212i\u01eb\ndt\nD(L)CORGI(t)\nt\n+\n\u222b \u2212s2+i\u01eb\n\u2212s1+i\u01eb\ndt\nD(L)CORGI(t)\nt\n)\n.\n(73)\nIf we set s1 to be large enough we can evaluate R(L)CORGI(s1) using the circular\ncontour in the s- plane, as in Eq.(8). Combining this circular integral with\nthe integrals above and below the real negative axis we arrive at R(L)CORGI(s2)\nwhere s2 can be as far into the infrared as we want. The all-orders CORGI\nresult can be compared with the NNLO CIPT\/APT CORGI result,\nRAPT (s) = A1(s) +X2A3(s) . (74)\nHere theAn(s) are the two-loop results of Eqs.(20,21), with A(s) = (\u22121\/e)(\n\u221a\ns\/\u039bD)\n\u2212b\/c\nin the CORGI scheme. Analogous to Fig.4 we plot in Fig.5 the comparison\nof the all-orders and NNLO APT CORGI results, Nf = 2 quark flavours are\nassumed. As in the one-loop case there is extremely close agreement at all\nvalues of s. For the fits to low-energy Re+e\u2212(s) data to be presented in the\nnext section, therefore, we shall use the NNLO CORGI APT result.\nBefore turning to phenomenological analysis in Section 4, we conclude\nthis section with a brief discussion of the situation for Euclidean observables.\nWe can define the Adler D function in the Euclidean region by inverting the\nintegral transform corresponding to the dispersion relation of Eq.(7). That\nis we can write,\nD(Q2) = Q2\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nds\n(s+Q2)2\nR(s) . (75)\nHowever, it is important to note that this inverse transform only determines\nD(Q2) up to an additive undetermined function F (Q2), satisfying\n1\n2\u03c0i\n\u222b \u2212s+i\u01eb\n\u2212s\u2212i\u01eb\ndt\nF (t)\nt\n= 0, (76)\nwhich makes no contribution to R(s). We know that the vacuum polar-\nization function \u03a0(Q2) (Eq.(4)) is analytic everywhere in the complex Q2\nplane cut along the negative real Q2 axis. Whilst any singularities away\nfrom the cut would be tachyonic and violate causality there will certainly be\nisolated infrared singularities which build the binding of quarks and gluons\n27\n0.0001 0.001 0.01 0.1 1 10 100 1000 10000\n-0.002\n-0.001\n0\n0.001\n0.002\ns\/\u039b\u02dc2V\n\u03b4R(s)\nFigure 5: \u03b4R(s) = R(L)CORGI(s)\u2212RAPT (s), at the two loop level for 2 flavours\nof quark.\nand which lie on the cut. Taking the example of a simple pole contribution\nF (Q2) = \u039b\u02dc2\/(Q2 +M2), we see that it satisfies Eq.(76) and hence makes no\ncontribution to R(s). F (Q2) is entirely non-perturbative and the ambiguity\nonly resides in theDNP (Q2) component. One can certainly define a Euclidean\nversion of APT by inserting the Minkowskian An(s) in the right-hand side\nof Eq.(75), and defining\nA(E)n (Q\n2) = Q2\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nds\n(s+Q2)2\nAn(s) . (77)\nThe one-loop result would be [6]\nA\n(E)\n1 (Q\n2) =\n2\nb\n[\n1\nln(Q2\/\u039b\u02dc2)\n+\n\u039b\u02dc2\n\u039b\u02dc2 \u2212Q2\n]\n. (78)\nThis Euclidean APT coupling freezes in the infrared to 2\/b, but this be-\nhaviour is induced by the second non-perturbative contribution, which can-\ncels the forbidden tachyonic Landau pole singularity present in the first per-\nturbative term. It can be modified at will by adding a suitable F (Q2) to\n28\nA\n(E)\n1 (Q\n2). For instance choosing F (Q2) to be a multiple of the simple pole\nabove, F (Q2) = \u03ba\u039b\u02dc2\/(Q2 +M2) one can obtain a modified APT coupling\nA\u02c6(E)(Q2) =\n2\nb\n[\n1\nln(Q2\/\u039b\u02dc2)\n+\n\u039b\u02dc2\n\u039b\u02dc2 \u2212Q2\n]\n+\n\u03ba\u039b\u02dc2\nQ2 +M2\n. (79)\nThe coupling has no Landau pole singularity and freezes to the infrared limit\n(2\/b) + \u03ba\u039b\u02dc2\/M2, which may be adjusted as required by changing the pa-\nrameters. A similar criticism of arbitrariness also applies to the modified\nAPT approach of [38], which has been applied to the quark-antiquark po-\ntential, supposedly demonstrating confinement. The possibility of modifying\nthe freezing behaviour by the addition of isolated singularities has also been\nnoted in [39] which modified the APT coupling of Eq.(78) by the addition\nof an infrared enhancement 1\/Q2 and a pole term of the kind we assumed\nabove, where in their interpretation the mass M corresponds to an excited\nstate of the gluon. In their case the modification was motivated by the fact\nthat freezing to 2\/b is inconsistent with the infrared behaviour of the gluon\npropagator implied by the Schwinger-Dyson equations. For the case of the\nAdler D function the freezing to 2\/b is inconsistent with arguments of spon-\ntaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the limit of a large number of colours\n[32] which imply that D(0) = 0, or equivalently D(0) = \u22121. This result\nis in apparent contradiction with our freezing result of R(0) = 2\/b, since\naccording to Ref.[40] R and D should have the same infrared freezing limit.\nThis argument follows directly from Eq.(8) if the circular contour is shrunk\nto zero. However, if there are indeed isolated singularities along the cut as\nin the case of the modified coupling of Eq.(79), the discontinuity across the\ncut in Eq.(7) is no longer equivalent to Eq.(8), and nothing can be inferred\nabout the freezing behaviour of D, which is entirely dependent on these\ninfrared singularities. Thus the freezing behaviour of R is perturbatively\ndeterminable, whereas the freezing behaviour of D is entirely determined by\nnon-perturbative effects. That this must be the case is easily seen as follows.\nIn the Minkowskian case of R the sin(\u03c0bz\/2)\/(\u03c0bz\/2) factor in the Borel\nintegrand ensured that the Borel integral remained defined at the Landau\ndivergence s = sL. In the Euclidean case of D there is no such factor and the\nBorel integral for a branch point contribution (1\u2212 z)\u2212\u03b3 in the Borel trans-\nform behaves as a(s)1\u2212\u03b3 as s \u2192 sL, and so may diverge if \u03b3\u22641. One would\nthen need to regulate this divergence by resumming a similarly diverging in-\nfinite subset of OPE terms, and removing this divergent piece from the DNP\n29\n0.1 1 10 100\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\nFreezing included\nNo freezing\nParton model\ns\/GeV2\nRe+e\u2212(s)\nFigure 6: Comparison of CORGI APT and the standard NNLO CORGI\ncalculations of Re+e\u2212(s) at low energies.\ncomponent, adding it to DPT . This would require detailed knowledge of the\nbranch point exponents and residues of B[D](z), and correspondingly of the\nall-orders OPE, which is unfortunately lacking.\n4 Comparison of NNLO APT with low energy\nRe+e\u2212 data\nIn this section we wish to compare the NNLO CORGI APT perturbative\npredictions with low energy experimental data for Re+e\u2212. The discussion\nso far has assumed massless quarks. To include quark masses we use the\napproximate result [3, 41]\nRe+e\u2212(s) = 3\n\u2211\nf\nQ2fT (vf)[1 + g(vf)R(s)] , (80)\nwith the sum over all active quark flavours, i.e. those with masses mf <\u221a\ns\/2, and where\nvf = (1\u2212 4m2f\/s)\n1\n2 ,\n30\nT (v) = v(3\u2212 v2)\/2 ,\ng(v) =\n4\u03c0\n3\n[\n\u03c0\n2v\n\u2212 3 + v\n4\n(\n\u03c0\n2\n\u2212 3\n4\u03c0\n)]\n. (81)\nFor the theoretical predictions we shall takeR(s) to be the NNLO CIPT\/APT\nCORGI result of Eq.(74). Starting with \u039b\u02dc\n(5)\nMS\n= 216MeV for Nf = 5 , cor-\nresponding to the world average value \u03b1s(MZ) = 0.1172 [42], we demand\nthat R(s) remains continuous as we cross quark mass thresholds. This\nthen determines \u039b\u02dc\n(Nf )\nMS\nfor Nf = 4, 3, 2. We take standard values for cur-\nrent quark masses for the light quarks [42] : mu = 3.0MeV, md = 6.75MeV,\nms = 117.5MeV, and also from [42] we take the values for pole masses of the\nheavy quarks mc = 1.65GeV, and mb = 4.85GeV. The approximate result\n[3] uses pole masses in Eq.(81), so we use pole masses where we can. Using\nthese values for the quark masses and \u03b1s(MZ), we plot the resulting Re+e\u2212(s)\nin Fig.6. The solid line corresponds to the CORGI APT result for R(s) in\nEq.(74). The dashed curve corresponds to the standard NLO fixed-order\nCORGI result,\nRCORGI(s) = a0(s) +\n(\nX2 \u2212 \u03c0\n2b2\n12\n)\na30(s) . (82)\nThe standard fixed-order result breaks down at s = \u039b2D = 0.4114GeV\n2,\nwhere there is a Landau pole. The APT result smoothly freezes in the infra-\nred. The dashed-dot curve shows the parton model result (i.e. assuming\nR(s) = 0).\nThe experimental data we have used comes from a variety of sources.\nFrom the two pion threshold up to\n\u221a\ns = 1.43GeV we use references [51], the\ndata from these references is given as individual exclusive channels which\nmust be combined to obtain the full hadronic cross section. In the region\nbetween 1.43GeV and 2.0GeV we use data from [44], [45], references [46],\n[47] are used in the region between 2.0GeV and 5.0GeV. From 5.0GeV\nto 7.25GeV we use [48], and from 7.25GeV to 10.52GeV we use [49], [50].\nThese sets of data all give the inclusive total hadronic cross section. Above\n10.52GeV we insert the NNLO CORGI APT prediction for Re+e\u2212, this is\nrepresented by the continuous line in Fig.7.\nIn order to simplify the analysis of the data we did not use overlapping\ndatasets, instead where one dataset overlapped another we simply took the\n31\n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nJ\/\u03a8 \u03a8(2S) \u03a5(1S)\n\u03a5(2S)\n\u03a5(3S)\n\u221a\ns\/GeV\nRe+e\u2212(s)\nFigure 7: Data used to compare with model, statistical errors shown only.\nbetter, smaller error, dataset in the region of the overlap in\n\u221a\ns. Errors were\ndealt with by taking each data point and calculating the effect of its statis-\ntical and its systematic error. The effect of its statistical error was added in\nquadrature with the other statistical errors. The contribution from the sys-\ntematic error was added to the other systematic errors from the same dataset,\nthen the contribution from the systematic errors of each dataset were added\nin quadrature with each other and the contribution from the statistical errors.\nAlso we have to consider the effect of narrow resonances not included in\nthe data, we employ the same approach as used in [10]. We assume that the\nnarrow resonances have a relativistic Breit-Wigner form\nRres(s) =\n9\n\u03b12\nBllBh\nM2\u03932\n(s\u2212M2)2 +M2\u03932 , (83)\nwhere \u03b1 is the QED coupling, and M,\u0393, Bll, Bh are the mass, width, lepton\nbranching ratio, and hadron branching ratio respectively. We are assuming\na narrow resonance i.e. \u0393 is small, so we approximate the resonance with a\n32\ndelta function\nRres(s) =\n9\n\u03b12\nBllBhM\u0393\u03c0\nM\u0393\/\u03c0\n(s\u2212M2)2 +M2\u03932 \u2248\n9\n\u03b12\nBllBhM\u0393\u03c0\u03b4(s\u2212M2).\n(84)\nThe compilation of data for Re+e\u2212 is shown in Fig.7. Narrow resonances\nare indicated by the vertical lines. Unfortunately it is not possible to directly\ncompare the experimental data with the theoretical predictions. This is be-\ncause there is not a direct correspondence between the quark mass thresh-\nolds in perturbation theory and the hadronic resonances. This difficulty can\nbe overcome if one employs a \u201csmearing procedure\u201d. We shall employ the\nmethod proposed by Poggio, Quinn and Weinberg [3], defining the smeared\nquantity\nR\u00afe+e\u2212(s; \u2206) =\n\u2206\n\u03c0\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ndt\nRe+e\u2212(t)\n(t\u2212 s)2 +\u22062 . (85)\nRe+e\u2212(s) itself is related to the vacuum-polarization function \u03a0(s) of Eq.(4)\nby,\n2iRe+e\u2212(s) = \u03a0(s + i\u01eb)\u2212 \u03a0(s\u2212 i\u01eb) , (86)\nthat is it is the discontinuity across the cut. The smeared R\u00afe+e\u2212(s; \u2206) can\nbe written as\n2iR\u00afe+e\u2212(s; \u2206) = \u03a0(s + i\u2206)\u2212 \u03a0(s\u2212 i\u2206) . (87)\nIf \u2206 is sufficiently large one is kept away from the cut, and is insensitive\nto the infrared singularities which occur there. If both data and theory are\nsmeared they can then be compared. One needs to choose \u2206 sufficiently\nlarge that resonances are averaged out. For the charm region it turns out\nthat \u2206 = 3GeV2 is a good choice, whilst for lower energies \u2206 = 1GeV2\nis adequate. In Fig.8(a) we choose \u2206 = 1GeV2. R\u00afe+e\u2212(s; \u2206) obtained\nfrom the data is represented by the solid line. The dashed-dot line is the\nsmeared NNLO CORGI APT prediction, assuming the quark mass thresh-\nolds as above with the exception of the charm quark whose mass is taken to\nbe mc = 1.35GeV for reasons which we shall shortly discuss. The dashed\nline is the parton model prediction. The shaded region denotes the error in\nthe data. It is clear that in the charm region the averaging is insufficient,\nalthough for lower energies the agreement is extremely good. In Fig.8(b) we\nshow the corresponding plot with \u2206 = 3GeV2.

Whilst we have indicated an error band associated with the\ndata, we have not indicated an error band for the theory prediction. There\nare several potential sources of error to consider. The first is the choice of\nrenormalisation scale. Our viewpoint would be that the use of the CORGI\nscale corresponds to a complete resummation of ultraviolet logarithms, as\nwe have argued elsewhere [37] attempts to estimate a theoretical error on\nthe perturbative predictions by making ad hoc changes in the renormaliza-\ntion scale, are simply misleading, and give no information on the importance\nof uncalculated higher-order corrections. For instance using scales \u00b52 = xs\nwhere x is varied between x = 1\n2\nand x = 2, with x = 1 providing a central\nvalue. We should note, however, that were we to have used such a procedure\nit would not have led to a noticeable difference in the theory curves, since\nthe APT has greatly reduced scale-dependence, as has been noted elsewhere\n[6]. A more important uncertainty is the precise value of the quark masses\nassumed, and in particular the choice of the charm quark mass mc. To il-\nlustrate how this effects the results we show in Fig.8(c) the curves obtained\nif we assume mc = 1.65GeV. As can be seen the theory curve is now incon-\nsistent with the data in the charm region, although for lower energies where\nthe charm quark has decoupled, the agreement is again good.\nThe uncertainty in the mass of the charm quark is exceptionally large.\nLooking at the different references used in [42] a value mc = 1.35GeV for\nthe pole mass is reasonable, and agrees well with [43] which is referenced in\n[42]. Part of the problem is the relationship between the pole mass and the\nMS mass for the charm quark, where the \u03b13s contribution is larger than the\n\u03b12s contribution. Obtaining the pole mass through MS mass calculations,\nwhich is done in [42], is not very satisfactory. Reference [43], which also fits\nlow-energy Re+e\u2212 data, gives a pole mass of mc = 1.33\u2212 1.4GeV, and so the\nchoice of 1.35GeV is reasonable.\nIt is possible to extend the smearing to spacelike values of s. We give the\ncorresponding curves for R\u00afe+e\u2212(s; \u2206), with mc = 1.35GeV, over the range\n\u22123 < s < 1 GeV2 in Figs.9(a),9(b), for \u2206 = 1GeV2, and \u2206 = 3GeV2,\nrespectively. The agreement between theory and experiment is extremely\ngood in both cases.\nIn Fig.10 we show R\u00afe+e\u2212(s; \u2206) in the upsilon region. The choice \u2206 =\n10GeV2 works quite well, we show the theory predictions for different mb\nvalues. A direct comparison between theory and data which does not involve\nsmearing is possible if one evaluates the area under the Re+e\u2212(s) data, that\n35\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n1\n2\n3\n4\nTheory, m\nc\n = 1.65 GeV\nParton, m\nc\n = 1.65 GeV\nData\n\u221a\ns\/GeV\nR(s; \u2206)\nFigure 8: (c): R(s; \u2206) in the charm region, with \u2206 = 3GeV2 here mc =\n1.65GeV.\n-3 -2 -1 0 1\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\nTheory, m\nc\n = 1.35 GeV\nData\nParton, m\nc\n = 1.35 GeV\ns\/GeV2\nR(s; \u2206)\nFigure 9: (a): R(s; \u2206) in the spacelike region, with \u2206 = 1GeV2.\n36\n-3 -2 -1 0 1\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\n1.8\nTheory, m\nc\n = 1.35 GeV\nData\nParton, m\nc\n = 1.35 GeV\ns\/GeV2\nR(s; \u2206)\nFigure 9: (b): R(s; \u2206) in the spacelike region, with \u2206 = 3GeV2.\n6 8 10 12 14 16\n3\n3.2\n3.4\n3.6\n3.8\nTheory, mb = 4.6 GeV\nTheory, mb = 5.1 GeV\nTheory, mb = 4.85 GeV\nParton, mb = 4.6 GeV\nData\n\u221a\ns\/GeV\nR(s; \u2206)\nFigure 10: R(s; \u2206) in the upsilon region, with \u2206 = 10GeV2.\n37\n5 5.5 6 6.5 7 7.5 8 8.5 9\n100\n200\n300\nTheory, m\nc\n = 1.35 GeV\nData\nParton m\nc\n = 1.35 GeV\nTheory, m\nc\n = 1.65 GeV\n\u221a\ns\/GeV\nI(s)\nFigure 11: Area under Re+e\u2212(s)\nis evaluates the integral,\nI(s) \u2261\n\u222b s\n4m2pi\nRe+e\u2212(t)dt , (88)\nwhere s lies well above the low-energy resonances in the continuum.

The functions in the Euclidean and Minkowski regions are interre-\nlated by the integral transforms of Eq.(7) (D \u2192 R) and Eq.(75) (R \u2192 D).\nIn a previous paper we pointed out the Minkowskian formulation of APT for\nthe quantity Re+e\u2212 was equivalent to the all-orders resummation of a con-\nvergent subset of analytical continuation terms [5]. This reorganisation of\nfixed-order perturbation theory gives apparent infrared freezing to the limit\n2\/b to all-orders in perturbation theory, and the functions An(s) at two-loop\nlevel could be written in closed form in terms of the Lambert W function.\nHowever, one might question whether this all-orders perturbative freezing\nhas any physical relevance. It is well-known that all-orders perturbation\ntheory by itself is insufficient, and that it must be complemented by the\nnon-perturbative Operator Product Expansion (OPE) [1, 2]. It is clear that\nthe OPE breaks down as s \u2192 0, since it is an expansion in powers of \u039b\u02dc2\/s.\nIn this paper we have shown how both the PT and the OPE components\ncan remain defined in the infrared limit. Writing a Borel representation for\nthe PT component one finds that it is ambiguous because of the presence\nof singularities on the integration contour, termed infrared renormalons [1].\nThese ambiguities, however, are of precisely the same form as OPE terms,\nand a regulation of the singularities in the Borel integrand induces a defi-\nnition of the OPE coefficients, allowing the two components to be defined.\nWe showed that the Borel integral representation inevitably breaks down at\na critical energy sL which we referred to as the \u201cLandau divergence\u201d. For\nMinkowskian quantities the Borel Transform contains an oscillatory factor\nwhich means that the Borel integral remains defined at s = sL. For s < sL\none needs to switch to an alternative Borel representation, which has ambi-\nguities due to ultraviolet renormalon singularities on the integration contour.\nCorrespondingly the OPE should be resummed and recast in the form of an\nexpansion in powers of s\/\u039b\u02dc2. The UV renormalon ambiguities in the Borel\nintegral are then of the same form as the terms in the modified OPE, and\nregulating the modified Borel integral induces a definition of the coefficients\nin the modified OPE, allowing both components to be defined. The modified\nBorel integral freezes to 2\/b in the infrared thanks to the presence of the\n40\noscillatory factor, whilst the modified OPE component necessarily vanishes,\nso that the perturbative component dominates in the infrared and ultravio-\nlet. We explicitly constructed the all-orders Borel representations using the\nall-orders leading-b approximation for R(s) [28], and a one-loop coupling.\nWe could express the Borel integral in closed form in terms of exponential\nintegral functions (Eq.(47)). With the standard continuation of the Ei(n, w)\nfunctions defined by Eq.(44) the result for R(L)PT (s) of Eq.(47) is a function\nof s which is well-defined at all energies, freezing to 2\/b in the infrared, and\ncontinuous at s = sL. The two-loop Borel representation was also discussed.\nThe details are similar to the one-loop case, with a modified oscillatory fac-\ntor and a shifted value of sL, the modified Borel representation again freezes\nto 2\/b in the infrared. At both one-loop and two-loops the APT modifica-\ntion of fixed-order perturbation theory corresponds to keeping the oscillatory\nfactor in the Borel integrand intact, and expanding the remainder. As a re-\nsult the APT results should be asymptotic to the Borel representations at\nall energies, underwriting the validity of the all-orders perturbative freezing\nbehaviour. It should be noted that we have somewhat oversimplified our\ndiscussion of the OPE contribution. The OPE coefficients are not constant,\nas in the toy example of Eq.(51), but are functions of a, Cn(a). Each co-\nefficient will involve a perturbation series in a which is divergent with n!\ngrowth of coefficients, and can be defined using a Borel representation. As\ndefined by analytic continuation from the OPE for DNP to that for RNP ,\nthe corresponding Borel integrands will contain the same oscillatory factors,\nenabling Cn(a) to remain defined at s = sL, and for s < sL one switches\nto the modified Borel representation. We should note that the difficulty of\nuniquely extending the Borel representation for Minkowskian quantities into\nthe infrared has also been discussed in Ref.[54], but with differing conclu-\nsions to us. A more closely related discussion concerning the significance and\ninterpretation of the Landau Pole is given in Ref.[30]. The modified Borel\nrepresentation of Eq.(50) and the promotion of UV renormalon singularities\nto the positive axis in the Borel z-plane has also been discussed in Ref.[32].\nWhilst the Minkowskian version of APT is underwritten by a Borel rep-\nresentation valid at all energies, this is not the case for the Euclidean version.\nThere is no oscillatory factor in the integrand in the Euclidean case, and the\nBorel integral will typically diverge as one approaches sL. To regulate this di-\nvergence one would need to identify and resum an infinite subset of similarly\ndivergent OPE terms. Unfortunately, however, the nature of the divergence\n41\nis only known if one has detailed information on the branch point exponents\nand residues of the Borel transform, and correspondingly information about\nthe all-orders OPE. At present we only have restricted information at the\nleading-b level. At a more fundamental level the Euclidean APT is ambigu-\nous, since it involves the integral transformation from R \u2192 D of Eq.(75),\nbut this only determines D up to an unspecified unknown function involving\ninfrared singularities lying on the cut on the negative Q2 axis which make no\ncontribution to R. Such singularities are involved in building confinement of\nquarks and gluons. Whilst the freezing behaviour of R is perturbatively de-\ntermined, that of D is determined by non-perturbative effects. The presence\nof singularities lying on the cut invalidates arguments in the literature that\nR and D have to freeze to the same infrared limit, if any [40].\nIn the final Section we performed fits of NNLO APT results to low energy\nRe+e\u2212 data. We needed to introduce quark masses approximately, and in or-\nder to avoid ambiguities due to the precise location of quark mass thresholds,\nwe used a smearing procedure. Extremely good agreement between theory\nand data was found.\nAn obvious further application would be to use the APT approach in\nthe analysis of the tau decay ratio R\u03c4 , and in particular the estimation of\nthe uncertainty in \u03b1s(MZ) which such measurements imply. In Ref.[7] this\nwas estimated by comparing NNLO APT in the CORGI approach, with an\nall-orders resummation based on the leading-b result. This all-orders resum-\nmation , however, was based on taking a principal value of the Borel integral,\nbut as we have shown in this paper one then has a sizeable discontinuity at\ns = sL. One should rather use a regulation of singularities corresponding\nto the standard continuation of Ei(n, w) functions implied by Eq.(44), and\nthen the all-orders result is continuous. As shown in Fig.5 the agreement\nbetween the NNLO and all-orders results for R is extremely good at all ener-\ngies. One may expect that the use of the discontinuous PV all-orders result\nfor R\u03c4 exaggerated the difference between it and the NNLO fixed-order APT\nresult, and hence that the uncertainty in \u03b1s(MZ) may in fact be considerably\nsmaller than that reported in Ref.[7]. We hope to investigate this in a future\npublication.\n42\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Andrei Kataev and Paul Stevenson for entertaining discussions\non infrared freezing in perturbative QCD.
