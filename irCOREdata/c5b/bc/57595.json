Introduction \n \nIn the 26\u00ba-33\u00ba S flat-slab segment of the Nazca plate in the Southern Andes, present-\nday landforms result from basement uplift on Miocene-to-Recent reverse faults located up to \n900 km away from the trench. These basement exposures of the Sierras Pampeanas give a \nunique opportunity to test models of lateral accretion of the continent, from the 2.0\u20132.2 Ga \nPaleoproterozoic sequences of the R\u00edo de la Plata craton in the east, to the modern Andes in \nthe west (Fig.1). Based on lithological differences, Caminos (1979) was the first to recognize \nan eastern group of sierras dominated by abundant Paleozoic granites and metasedimentary \nrocks (the Eastern Sierras Pampeanas), and a western group characterized by abundant meta-\nbasic, ultrabasic and calc-silicate rocks (the Western Sierras Pampeanas). Modern \ngeochronological studies have demonstrated that the Western Sierras Pampeanas (WSP) \npreserve a completely different geological history, involving an exposed Mesoproterozoic \ncrystalline basement (e.g., McDonough et al., 1993; Pankhurst & Rapela, 1998; Varela et al., \n 3\n2003; Casquet et al., 2001, 2004; Vujovich et al., 2004). From north to south, the main sierras \nof the WSP are Toro Negro, Umango, Espinal, Maz, Pie de Palo and El Gigante (Fig. 1). \nMesoproterozoic ages have been also reported to the south of the WSP, in low-relief outcrops \nof the San Rafael block at 35\u00baS (Astini et al., 1996; Cingolani & Varela, 1999) and scattered \noutcrops of tonalite-trondhjemites in the Las Matras block at 36\u00ba 46\u2019S (Sato et al., 2000, \n2004) (Fig. 1). To the west of the WSP, the basement of the Early Paleozoic sequences of the \nPrecordillera is inferred to be Mesoproterozoic in age, based on studies of xenoliths in \nTertiary volcanic rocks (Abruzzi et al., 1993; Kay et al., 1996), while geochronological data \nobtained from scattered outcrops of the basement in the Late Paleozoic Frontal Cordillera \nshow that the Grenville\u2013age basement extends further west (Ramos & Basei, 1997; Basei et \nal., 1998) (Fig. 1). Therefore a large sector of the Southern Andes basement and foreland, at \nleast 1100 km long, is formed by Grenville\u2013age blocks whose relationships to each other are \nlargely unknown.  \n The aim of this paper is to start unravelling the early history of this collage of \ncontinental blocks by means of a comparative study of the chemistry, isotopic composition, \nand magmatic-metamorphic history of Sierra de Maz and Sierra de Pie de Palo, two of the \nlargest and best exposed units of the WSP. As in any geological study of the WSP, ours is \nhampered by a number of uncertainties derived from the numerous rifting and orogenic events \noverprinted on the Grenville-age basement. Some of the detected overprinting events include: \n(a) rifting episodes recorded by intrusion of A-type granites at 840 Ma and 770 Ma (Baldo et \nal., 2006, 2008), and carbonatites and nepheline syenites at 570 Ma (Casquet et al., 2008), (b) \nEarly Paleozoic metamorphism associated with the docking\/collision\/strike-slip displacement \nof the WSP and the Precordillera terrane during their final attachment to Gondwana (this has \nbeen the topic of much debate in recent years, and reviews have been reported in a special \nsymposium of the 33rd IGC (Casquet et al., 2008; Finney et al., 2008; Thomas & Astini, \n 4\n2008), and (c) deformation related to the Late Paleozoic (Gondwanan) and Andean orogenies. \nThe effect of the important Late Paleozoic deformation on the basement is poorly known, \nwhereas the Tertiary\u2013Recent block uplift on reverse faults and imbrication have been better \nstudied. As a result of the Early Paleozoic and Andean tectonics, Grenville-age blocks are \nimbricated with post-Grenvillian terranes (Casquet et al., 2008), and very detailed studies are \nneeded to establish connections between even adjacent lithological domains.  \n \n2. Geological setting \n \n2.1 Sierra de Maz \n \nIn the basement of the sierras of Maz and Espinal three domains, separated by first-\norder shear zones and younger faults (Fig. 2), can be distinguished on the basis of field, \ngeochronology and isotope composition evidence (Casquet et al., 2006, 2008 and references \ntherein). The Eastern Domain consists for the most part of high-grade rocks younger than 1.0 \nGa (garnet-sillimanite migmatites and paragneisses with subordinate marbles and \namphibolites). Metamorphism took place during the Famatinian orogeny at ca. 440 Ma (see \nalso Lucassen and Becchio, 2003). The Central Domain (also known as the Maz Domain) \nconsists of medium-grade metasediments (kyanite-sillimanite-garnet-staurolite schists, \nquartzites, amphibolites and marbles) and high-grade ultramafic to intermediate meta-igneous \nand metasedimentary rocks that underwent a Grenville-age orogeny starting at ca. 1.2 Ga \n(Porcher et al., 2004; Casquet et al., 2006). Deposition of the sedimentary protolith sequences \noccurred during the Paleoproterozoic (between 1.7 and 1.9 Ga, U\u2013Pb SHRIMP age of detrital \nzircon, Casquet et al., 2006). Massif-type meta-anorthosites and associated meta-jotunite \ndykes of 1070 \u00b1 41 Ma are restricted to the eastern side of the Central Domain and show \nevidence for Famatinian metamorphic rejuvenation at 431 \u00b1 40 Ma (observed throughout the \ndomain, Casquet et al., 2004). Moreover, metamorphic and geochronological discontinuities \n 5\nwithin the Maz Domain suggest that it is in fact composed of a number of slivers separated by \nshear zones. All the samples analysed in this study are from the Maz Central Domain (Fig. 2). \nThe Western Domain consists again of metasedimentary rocks younger than 1.0 Ga that \nunderwent Famatinian metamorphism. One sequence of rocks composed of thick marble beds, \ncalcic pelitic schists and quartzites is probably equivalent to the Neoproterozoic Difunta \nCorrea metasedimentary sequence of Sierra de Pie de Palo, and to isotopically-similar rocks \nof Sierra de Umango (Varela et al. 2001; Galindo et al. 2004). Most rocks within this domain \nare low- to medium-grade, but high-grade rocks are found locally. \nMylonitic A-type orthogneisses of 840 Ma have been recently reported in the Maz \nCentral Domain and Sierra de Espinal (Baldo et al., 2008), while ca. 570 Ma carbonatites and \nassociated Ne-syenites probably represent the latest rifting event of the Grenville-age block \nbefore amalgamation to Gondwana (Casquet et al., 2008).  \n \n2.2 Sierra de Pie de Palo \n \n  Sierra de Pie de Palo exposes a meta-igneous and metasedimentary complex of \nstacked nappes thrust towards the west during the Early Paleozoic (Fig. 3). The nappes rest \nupon the almost unmetamorphosed Precordillera passive-margin sequence of early Cambrian \nage (Caucete Group), below the Pirquitas basal thrust (Galindo et al., 2004; Ramos et al., \n1996; Mulcahy et al., 2007) (Fig. 3). \n   Grenvillian ages from Sierra de Pie de Palo first reported by Varela & Dalla Salda \n(1993), McDonough et al. (1994) and Pankhurst & Rapela (1998) were later confirmed in \nother studies (e.g., Casquet et al., 2001; Vujovich et al., 2004). Two domains with well-\nconstrained Mesoproterozoic lithologies are recognized. A structurally lower unit of mostly \nmeta-mafic and meta-ultramafic rocks composed of serpentinite and metapyroxenite bodies, \nmassive metagabbros, metadiorites, mafic schists, amphibolites and garnet-amphibolites \n(Vujovich & Kay, 1998 and references therein). This unit is referred to in the geological map \n 6\n(Fig. 3) as the Grenvillian \u201coceanic arc back-arc complex\u201d (see below). It overlies the \nsiliciclastic and carbonate platform sequences of the Early Paleozoic Caucete Group along the \nPirquitas Thrust (Vujovich & Kay, 1998) (Fig. 3). An upper imbricate thrust sequence of \nmarbles, calc-silicate rocks, schists, gneisses, quartzites, subordinate amphibolites and \nabundant acidic orthogneisses, including meta-trondhjemites and meta-tonalites, dominate the \ncentral and eastern part of the sierra (Fig. 3). Isotope studies and detrital zircon ages obtained \nfrom marbles, calc-silicate schists, quarztites and amphibole-garnet schists in the southern \npart of the sierra, previously considered Mesoproterozoic, indicate that these rocks in fact \nconstitute a distinct Neoproterozoic platform sequence, the Difunta Correa sequence (580\u2013\n620 Ma, Galindo et al., 2004; Rapela et al., 2005), which overlies Mesoproterozoic basement. \nA-type granitic orthogneisses dated at 870 Ma (Baldo et al., 2006), the Difunta Correa \nmetasedimentary sequence and the Mesoproterozoic basement are thoroughly imbricated in \nthe central and eastern part of the sierra. Although a detailed knowledge of the \nMesoproterozoic basement in the upper imbricate thrust sequence is still missing, but the \nassembled lithological  includes different types of amphibolites, orthogneisses and \nmetasedimentary rocks. Determination of stratigraphical relationships is however hampered \nby the strong deformation and difficult access. Intrusion of Early Ordovician granites (470\u2013\n481 Ma, Pankhurst & Rapela, 1968; Baldo et al., 2005) and Middle Ordovician amphibolite \nfacies metamorphism (455\u2013460 Ma, Casquet et al., 2001; Vujovich et al., 2004) are among \nthe later events registered in Pie de Palo.  \n  Based on geochemical data, Vujovich & Kay (1968) interpreted the overall Grenville-\nage rocks of Pie de Palo as formed in an oceanic arc\/back-arc complex similar to those in the \nwestern Pacific region. A U\u2013Pb age of 1204 \u00b1 5 Ma obtained in a gabbroic pegmatite of the \nlower unit constrains the timing of the assumed arc rifting and back-arc spreading stage \n(Vujovich et al., 2004). U\u2013Pb ages of 1169 \u00b1 8 Ma and 1174 \u00b1 43 Ma obtained from tonalitic-\n 7\ngranodioritic sills and dykes that intrude both Mesoproterozoic domains were interpreted as \nrepresenting either arc activity during and after back-arc spreading or a tectonically-unrelated \narc (Vujovich et al., 2004).    \n2.3 The basement of the Precordillera: the Ull\u00fan xenoliths \n \n  The Cambrian and Early Ordovician sedimentary sequence of the Precordillera, \nlocated adjacent to the west of Sierra de Pie de Palo (Fig. 1), has no exposed underlying \nbasement. Only indirect evidence of the age and composition of this basement comes from \nxenoliths included in Miocene dacitic to andesitic rocks that penetrated the Cambro-\nOrdovician strata. The best studied localities are the Ull\u00fan and Cerro Blanco volcanic centres \ndescribed by Leveratto (1968) and Abruzzi et al. (1993), subsequently studied in more detail \nby Kay et al. (1996).  \n  Metamorphic xenoliths, ranging in size from <3 cm up to 25 cm across, were \nconsidered by Abruzzi et al. (1993) and Kay et al. (1996) to have been mostly derived from \nmafic (SiO2 = 48\u201354%) and felsic (SiO2 = 69\u201371%) igneous protoliths. Three distinct xenolith \nsuites were recognized:  \ni) mafic pyroxene granulite and pyroxene\u2013garnet granulite gneiss interpreted as \nderived from basaltic to basaltic-andesitic magmas formed in an oceanic back-arc \nor juvenile continental crustal back-arc setting.  \nii) deformed mafic amphibolitic schists interpreted as representing unfractionated \nmantle-derived arc magmas. A U\u2013Pb zircon age for one sample from this suite \nyielded an upper intercept age of 1102 \u00b1 6 Ma, which was considered a \ncrystallization age. Two zircon fractions from the same sample, but with lower U \nand Pb concentrations, defined a ~ 1083 Ma 207Pb\/206Pb age, interpreted as a \nmetamorphic event.  \n 8\niii) biotite-bearing acid gneisses of dacitic composition interpreted as crustal melts. \nZircon data from two samples of this group are highly discordant: three fractions \nfrom one sample yield an upper intercept age of 1096 \u00b1 50 Ma, while if the all six \nfractions from the samples are regressed together, the resulting upper intercept age \nis 1118 \u00b1 54 Ma.  \n \n4. Geochemistry and Nd isotope data: tectonomagmatic affinities \n \n4.1 Sierra de Maz \n  \nThe database for Sierra de Maz consists of 26 new whole-rock chemical analyses and \n12 Nd isotope determinations on selected samples of the main meta-igneous units of the \nCentral Domain (see Tables 1 and 2 (Data Repository), and Fig. 2 for sample location). \nAmphibolites and orthogneisses of the Central Domain exhibit a silica range from 45 to 74% \nSiO2 and can be subdivided in two main groups (Fig. 4). A first group of subalkaline samples \n(calcic to calc-alkaline fields, Fig. 4a and b), is composed of medium-K amphibolites (46\u2013\n48% SiO2), separated by a silica gap of 62\u201374% SiO2 from mostly medium-K orthogneisses \n(Fig. 4c). This subalkaline group, as well as metasedimentary schists and gneisses, are the \ncountry rock of the anorthosite massif in the northeastern side of Sierra de Maz (Fig. 2).  \nA second group includes meta-anorthosites, meta-jotunites and an alkali-calcic series \ndefined by high-K orthogneisses that plot in the monzonite and quartz-monzonite fields of the \nplutonic TAS diagram (Fig. 4a, b). High-K amphibolites with shoshonite composition are \ntentatively linked to this group (Fig. 4c). Note that the massif-type meta-anorthosites of Sierra \nde Maz plot in the monzodiorite and monzogabbro fields (Fig. 4a). The trace element \ngeochemistry and Nd isotope signature of both groups are described in more detail below \n(Figs. 5, 6 and 10).  \n \n \n 9\n4.1.1 Subalkaline series: Andean type, cordilleran granites and subduction-related basic rocks.  \n \nThe first group of subalkaline orthogneisses consists of metamorphosed diorites, \ntonalites, granodiorites and monzoganites, with SiO2 62\u201374%, Na2O+K2O 5.2\u20136.7%, \nFeOt+MgO 3\u20137%, REE patterns with [La\/Yb]N = 10\u201345 and a weak positive Eu anomaly \n(Eu\/Eu* = 1.1\u20131.4) (Table 1, Fig. 5a). The overall subalkaline geochemistry of these meta-\ngranitic rocks is coupled with Ga\/Al (1000*Ga\/Al = 2.0\u20132.5), FeOt \/MgO (2\u20138), Zr\/Nb (>17) \nand Ba\/La (15\u201350) ratios that are characteristic of metaluminous magmas emplaced in \nconvergent margins rather than intraplate settings (Pearce et al., 1984; Whalen et al., 1987; \nEby 1990). Normalized to Ocean Ridge Granites (ORG) the subalkaline orthogneisses are \nenriched in K, Rb and Ba and depleted in Ta, Nb, Hf , Zr Y and Yb, which is also typical of \narc-related magmas (Fig. 5b), in particular the cordilleran tonalitic to granitic suites (e.g., \nHerv\u00e9 et al., 2007). The \u03b5Ndt values range from +4.1 for the tonalite\/diorite to -0.8 in the \ngranodiorite and -7.2 in the granite (Fig. 6, Table 1). This indicates a significant amount of \nmature continental crust contamination of the acidic units, whereas the tonalite\/diorite \npreserves the typical mantle signature of cordilleran tonalites.  \nThe medium-K subalkaline amphibolites show some arc geochemical affinities, such \nas LILE- and Th enrichment and compatible element depletion when normalized against N-\nMORB, but they do not show other characteristics such as LREE enrichment and Nb \ndepletion (Fig. 5c). \u03b5Ndt varies from +3 to -1.5, with the typical range of Zr content for \nsubalkaline rocks (30\u201360 ppm, Fig. 6). As in the case of the subalkaline orthogneisses, this \nvariation in \u03b5Ndt correlates with an increase of silica content, from 45.8 to 48.5% (Fig. 4, \nTable 1), again suggesting crustal contamination of the original basic magmas. These \nsubalkaline meta-basic rocks, and the meta-granitic suite, have the typical igneous lithology \nformed in convergent margins such as the southern Andes, where basalt and basaltic-andesite \n 10\nstratovolcanoes and cordilleran batholiths largely constitute the edge of the continent (Herv\u00e9 \net al., 2007).  \n \n4.1.2 Alkali-calcic orthogneisses and massif-type anorthosites: an AMCG complex \n \nThe high-K alkali-calcic orthogneisses and amphibolites of the Central Domain show \nall the geochemical characteristic of a magmatic series that is transitional to the alkaline field. \nThe orthogneisses are meta-monzonite and meta-quartz monzonites with SiO2 57.1 \u2013 68.4%, \nNa2O+K2O 6.8\u20138.6%, FeOt+MgO 3.8\u20139.2%, REE patterns with [La\/Yb]N = 3\u201315 and a \npositive Eu anomaly (Eu\/Eu* = 1.1\u20131.7) (Table 1, Fig. 5a). This mild alkaline signature is \nalso observed in the relatively high contents of incompatible elements, both LILE and HFSE \n(Fig. 5b), and the high ratios of Ga\/Al (1000*Ga\/Al = 2.5\u20133.5) and FeOt \/MgO (7\u201325) are \ndiagnostic of A-type granites and, generally, of acidic within-plate magmatism (Pearce et al., \n1984; Leat et al., 1986; Whalen et al., 1987; Eby, 1990). The Zr content has been considered \nuseful for the recognition of alkaline signatures in rhyolitic rocks, and low-Zr (< 300 ppm) \nrocks are termed \u201csubalkaline\u201d, while high-Zr (> 350 ppm) are classed as \u201cperalkaline\u201d (Leat \net al., 1986). The Zr content of the high-K orthogneisses is very high (450\u20131150 ppm), and \nthey also have \u03b5Ndt values of +0.3 and -4.5 (Fig.6), the latter indicating participation of the \ncrust in the granitic source. Hypersthene-bearing monzonite and granitic rocks with intraplate \nsignatures are often associated with massif-type anorthosites, producing the so-called AMCG \ncomplex (Anorthosites-Mangerites-Charnockites-Granites) (Emslie, 1978), which are \ncommon in the Grenville province of Canada (Corrigan and Hanmer, 1997; Rivers, 1997) and \nin the Appalachian Grenvillian basement. The original anorthosites, monzonites and quartz \nmonzonites of Sierra de Maz underwent a Lower Paleozoic medium to high-grade event that \ntransformed the original fabric and mineralogy during the docking of the Western Sierras \nPampeanas against Gondwana (Casquet et al., 2008a). It is considered here that the high-K \n 11\nalkali-calcic orthogneisses and adjacent anorthositic massif of Sierra de Maz (Fig. 2) formed \nan intraplate AMCG complex, emplaced during a single broad magmatic episode (see \ngeochronological section).  \n \n4.1.3 The Maz massif anorthosite \n \n The anorthositic massif of Sierra de Maz (Fig. 2) was first described by Casquet et al. \n(2004). Although this body has been also affected by Lower Paleozoic medium to high-grade \nmetamorphism and deformation, it is one of the best preserved Grenville-age magmatic units \nof the Western Sierras Pampeanas. Original relationships between the different anorthositic \nfacies and the related mafic jotunites are still recognized, so that mathematical modelling of \nigneous geochemical trends can be used to constrain the fractional crystallization history. A \nrefinement of the data and model presented by Casquet et al. (2004) is based on 12 new \nchemical analyses reported in Table 2 (Data Repository).  \n The main facies of the anorthosites is dominated by intermediate plagioclase showing \nsparse small pockets of mafic minerals. Occasionally, the proportion of mafic minerals \nincreases, forming a jotunite groundmass with plagioclase phenocrysts or synplutonic dykes \nwithin the main facies. The bulk leucocratic anorthosites have high Al2O3 (23.5\u201327.5%) and \nSr (720\u2013930 ppm), and low to moderate K2O (0.4\u20131.5%). They display moderately LREE-\nenriched chondrite-normalized patterns (La\/YbN = 32 to 5) and positive Eu anomalies \n(Eu\/Eu* = 13.5 to 2.5) (Fig. 7a). The SiO2-poor jotunites (SiO2 38.9 \u2013 48.1%) are enriched in \nFeO, TiO2, MgO, P2O5, Zr, Hf and Ta, and depleted in Al2O3, Na2O and Sr; their REE \npatterns are enriched in total REE with a slight negative to positive Eu anomaly (Eu\/Eu* = \n0.85\u20131.1) (Figs. 4 and 7a). The Nd isotope compositions of the anorthosites and jotunites are \nvariable: \uf065Nd t = +3.4 to -1.2 indicating a probable mantle source with moderate \ncontamination by old continental crust (Casquet et al., 2004). A refined model of trace \n 12\nelement fractional crystallization in which a sample of the main facies (MAZ12052, Table 2) \nand the jotunites are late stage residual liquids, is presented in Fig. 7b. The modelled daughter \nmelts after 80, 90 and 95 % crystallization predict an increase in REEt and Zr, a decrease in \nthe initial positive Eu anomaly, which becomes slightly negative at 95% crystallization, and a \ndecrease in the positive Sr anomaly, which becomes negative for the residual melts at 90\u201395% \ncrystallization (Fig. 7b). Patterns displayed by the SiO2-poor jotunites (SiO2 39\u201342%, Fig. 7a) \nare very similar to the modelled residual melts, in the production of which Zr behaves as an \nincompatible element.  \n \n4.1.4 Alkali-calcic amphibolites \n \n Alkali-calcic amphibolites with SiO2 45.1 \u2013 54.1%, K2O 1.3\u20132.7 and Na2O-2.0 \u2264 K2O \n(Table 1, Fig. 1c) show affinities with the shoshonitic series (Ewart, 1982; Le Maitre, 1989). \nSamples with SiO2 45\u201347% have REE patterns with [La\/Yb]N = 2\u20132.5 and weak positive Eu \nanomalies (Eu\/Eu* = 1.1\u20131.3), while a sample with 54% SiO2 shows an enriched pattern with \n[La\/Yb]N = 7 and a negative Eu anomaly (Eu\/Eu* = 0.75) (Table 1, Fig. 5a). Normalized \nagainst N-MORB these rocks are enriched in LILE and LREE (Fig. 5c) and have high \nabundances of HFSE elements, particularly the most acidic sample (MAZ12017, SiO2 = 54%, \nNb=65 ppm, and Ta=3.9 ppm, Table 1).  \n \n4.2 Sierra de Pie de Palo \n \n The geochemistry and Nd isotope composition of the orthogneisses and mafic units \nfrom Sierra de Pie de Palo (Fig. 3) are based on of 12 new analyses (Table 3, Data \nRepositary) and previous results reported by Vujovich & Kay (1998) and Vujovich et al. \n(2004).  \n4.2.1 The oceanic arc\/back-arc complex  \n \n 13\nIn the lower mafic-ultramafic unit of Sierra de Pie de Palo (Fig. 3), amphibolites with \nN-MORB, back-arc like, geochemical signatures are common (pattern field, Fig. 9a, 9b) \n(Vujovich & Kay, 1998). However, both in the lower unit and in the overlaying imbricate \nthrust domain, there are also abundant subalkaline amphibolites and meta-gabbros that do not \ndisplay the same geochemical characteristics (calcic field, Fig. 8). These latter rocks, \nincluding the SHRIMP-analysed gabbro sample SPP2067, show SiO2 = 44.5. \u2013 53.3%, K2O = \n0.2\u20131.1%, Al2O3 11.4\u201317.1% and REE patterns with [La\/Yb]N = 0.6\u20132.7 and Eu\/Eu* = 0.75\u2013\n1.06) (Table 3, Fig. 9a). Normalized against N-MORB they are enriched in LILE, Th and \nLREE elements, which is taken as evidence that they formed in a supra-subduction zone \nenvironment, although they do not show the Nb depletion of many arc basalts (Fig. 9b). The \npattern of the 1204 \u00b1 5 Ma VL38 metagabbro dated by Vujovich et al. (2004) is also shown \nfor comparison. A depleted mantle source is inferred for the calcic arc-related amphibolites \nand metagabbros (\uf065Nd t = +4.5 \u2013 +8, Fig. 6). This suggests that the lower mafic-ultramafic \nunit is probably built on complex stacking of arc and back-arc rocks (Vujovich and Kay, \n1998).  \n \n4.2.2 Arc-related calc-alkaline orthogneisses \n \n Subordinate and sparse outcrops of a calc-alkaline orthogneiss series can be \ndistinguished in Sierra de Pie de Palo. The dated sample SPP6076 is a calc-alkaline \northogneiss (Fig. 8) that shows a moderately steep REE pattern ([La\/Yb]N = 12.5) with well-\ndeveloped middle REE depletion and a weak negative Eu anomaly, suggesting amphibole and \nfeldspar fractionation (Fig. 10a). It is enriched in LREE and Ba, and shows negative Nb and \nSr anomalies when normalized against N-MORB (Fig. 10b). The 1108 \u00b1 13 Ma calc-alkaline \northogneisses from Sierra de Umango studied by Varela et al. (2003) show similar but even \nsteeper REE patterns (Fig. 10b), suggesting equilibration with a garnet-bearing residue. \nSubduction under more mature crust is the preferred tectonic environment for this \n 14\nmagmatism, which shows the least juvenile Nd isotope signature in this sierra (\uf065Nd t = -0.2, \nFig. 6b).  \n \n4.2.3 The Mogote-Corralito TTG suite \n \nAt the top of Sierra de Pie de Palo, within the imbricate thrust domain, a distinct \nsequence of metaluminous meta-trondhjemites and meta-tonalites forms the dominant \nlithology (Quebrada Mogote-Corralito, Fig. 3), with SiO2 73.6 \u2013 77.1%, Na2O, 4.9\u20135.1%, \nFeOt+MgO 2.5\u20133.3%, REE patterns with [La\/Yb]N = 2.3\u20133.0 and a negative Eu anomaly \n(Eu\/Eu* = 0.56\u20130.72) (Table 3, Fig. 10c). Associated leucocratic granitic veins that plot on \nthe same Rb\u2013Sr isochron (Pankhurst & Rapela, 1998), show a negative slope of the REE \npatterns (Fig. 10c), suggesting fractionation of a LREE-rich accessory mineral such as allanite \nduring the late crystallization stages. Allanite is an accessory mineral in the host \ntrondhjemites. A mantle signature is indicated by the low 87Sr\/86Sr initial ratio (0.7045, \nPankhurst & Rapela, 1998), which is confirmed by a juvenile \u03b5Ndt of +3.8 for the meta-\ntrondhjemite sample dated by U\u2013Pb SHRIMP in this study (SPP414a, Fig. 6). Generation of \nthis TTG suite in an arc environment is consistent with the low abundances of HFSE such as \nNb and Ta, low Ga\/Al ratio (1000*Ga\/Al = 0.7\u20132.2) and low Sr\/Y (3.7\u20134.0) (Table 3), while \nthe low [La\/Yb]N ratios suggest a source outside the garnet stability field. Note that the 1244 \n\u00b1 42 Ma metaluminous tonalites and trondhjemites from Las Matras block (Fig. 1, Sato et al., \n2000, 2004) show similar but slightly steeper REE patterns [La\/Yb]N = 3.7\u20135.5 (Sato et al., \n2000) (Fig. 10c).  \n \n4.3 Precordillera basement: the Ull\u00fan xenoliths \n \n The chemical analysis of a SHRIMP-dated foliated mafic xenolith enclosed in a \nMiocene dacite intruded in the Precordillera (sample ULLU2100, Fig. 3) is shown in Table 3 \n(Data Repository) and Figs. 6b, 8c and 9c. Relative to the compositions of the xenolith groups \n 15\nrecognized in the same outcrops by Kay et al. (1996), the major and trace element abundances \nof sample ULLU2100 are very similar to the least siliceous samples of the mafic amphibolite \ngroup (SiO2 = 47.7\u201350.9%, Figs. 8c and 9c), while the \uf065Nd t (+4.5) is slightly less primitive \nthan those of the most mafic amphibolites (+3.2 to +3.5, Table 4 of Kay et al., 1996). \nAltogether these characteristics point to relatively unfractionated mantle-derived arc \nmagmatic rocks for the protoliths of the amphibolites, as was first inferred by Abruzzi et al. \n(1993).  \nIt is worth pointing out that a more siliceous mafic amphibolite xenolith sample \ndescribed by Kay et al. (1996) (UZ93B, SiO2 = 53.4, %, \uf065Nd t = +2.1, 1102 \u00b1 6 Ma) (Fig. 8c), \nshows a distinct, steeper, REE pattern (Fig. 9c) that resembles that of the roughly coeval calc-\nalkalic orthogneiss of Sierra de Pie de Palo (SPP6076, SiO2 = 68.2%, \uf065Nd t = -0.2 Ma, 1110 \u00b1 \n10 Ma) (Fig. 10a,b), which is however more siliceous and does not show the typical high Cr \nand Ni contents of the mafic amphibolite xenolith group.  \n \n5. U\u2013Pb zircon geochronology \n5.1 Samples and method  \nSampling for SHRIMP U\u2013Pb zircon dating was designed to provide information on \ncrystallization ages of the main magmatic series recognized in the sierras of Maz and Pie de \nPalo (Figs. 8\u201310), and of a xenolith interpreted as derived from the basement of the \nPrecordillera (Figs 8c and 10c). Under CL imaging the sectioned zircon grains were seen to \nhave metamorphic overgrowths, so an additional aim was to constrain the timing of \nmetamorphism. Sample localities are shown in the maps (Figs. 2, 3); precise coordinates and \na short description of the mineralogy and fabric for each sample are provided in the following \nsection. Mineral abbreviations follow Kretz (1983). \n 16\nThe separated zircons were mounted in epoxy together with reference zircons, sectioned \nand polished. U-Th-Pb analyses were made using SHRIMP II or SHRIMP RG at the Research \nSchool of Earth Sciences, The Australian National University, Canberra, following methods \ngiven in Williams (1998) and references therein. Cathodo-luminescence (CL) images were \nprepared for all zircon grains and were used to target specific areas for analysis. The data \nwere processed using the SQUID Excel macro (Ludwig 2001). U-Pb data are given in Table 4 \n(Data Repository); details of the reference zircons used to calibrate the U\/Pb ratios and the \ncalibration uncertainties are also given in data repository tabulations. Uncertainties in Table 4 \nfor individual analyses (ratios and ages) are at the one-sigma level.  \nWetherill concordia plots, probability density plots with stacked histograms, and \nweighted mean and Concordia age calculations were carried out using Isoplot\/Ex (Ludwig, \n2003); age uncertainties are reported as 95% confidence limits. In some cases, the \u201cmixture \nmodelling\u201d algorithm of Sambridge and Compston (1994) was used (via Isoplot\/Ex) to \nstatistically separate age populations or groupings. Due to the difficulty in determining \nprecise, common-Pb corrected, radiogenic 207Pb\/206Pb ratios for ca. 1 Ga zircons by SHRIMP, \na range of techniques was employed to calculate individual best age estimates. The choice of \ntechnique was based on factors such as the U content of the zircon area analysed (which flows \nonto the amount of radiogenic 207Pb), the ability to detect 204Pb, the strength of the primary \nion beam used for the analysis, and whether the area analysed is considered to have lost \nradiogenic Pb, etc. This is discussed below on a sample-by-sample basis. \n \n5.2 Analytical Results \nMAZ-7099, Sierra de Maz (29\u02da16' 06.4'', 68\u02da21' 09.1''). This sample is a subalkaline, medium-\nK, metadioritic orthogneiss (Fig. 4); its main mineralogy is Pl-Qtz-Hbl-Cpx-Bt-Ttn-Ep, with \naccessory Op, Ap and Zrn. The original granular igneous fabric is still preserved, but an \n 17\namphibolite-facies coronitic texture with Cpx, Anf, Pl and myrmekitic Ep is also well \ndeveloped. Zircons are large (~200 \uf06dm across) and sub-round to somewhat elongated, often \nwith faceted forms. A summary of the initial results was presented by Casquet et al. (2005) \nbut a re-interpretation is presented here, taking into account a larger database.  \nThe zircons from this sample show complex internal structure under CL (Fig.11). In \ngeneral the grains have an igneous component that shows weak oscillatory zoning (as \ncore\/centres), which in places is overgrown by a sector-zoned zircon component reflecting a \nhigh-grade metamorphic paragenesis. Some grains are dominated by the metamorphic zircon \ncomponent. A few grains have thin bright luminescent rims that are significantly less than 10 \nmicrons in width and so difficult to analyse. \nThe analyses cluster close to or within uncertainty of concordia (Wetherill plot) and \nhave 207Pb\/206Pb ages ranging from ca. 980 to ca. 1290 Ma. The U content is variable, ranging \nup to 300 ppm, but many areas analysed have less than 44 ppm U. The Th content is covariant \nand, whilst the CL images indicate a metamorphic paragenesis, the Th\/U ratios are in the \nrange of normal igneous zircon (ca. 0.4 \u2013 0.8). This suggests that the high-grade metamorphic \nzircon growth has occurred without significant Th depletion, a feature that has been \ndocumented previously (see Goodge et al., 2001). The low U contents make it difficult to \ndetermine precise 207Pb\/206Pb ratios and ages. Given the general concordance of the analyses, \nour preferred treatment of this low U data-set is based on the radiogenic 206Pb\/238U ages, as \nshown in the probability density plot (inset Fig.11). There is a poorly defined older grouping \nof dates, with one peak at about 1260 Ma and a subordinate one at about 1330 Ma. These \ngenerally correspond to the core analyses and are taken reflecting the time of igneous \ncrystallization of the orthogneiss protolith.  Two younger groupings are better defined as \ndiscrete events, one at ca. 1175 Ma and a younger at ca.1095 Ma. These younger ages are \n 18\ninterpreted as representing metamorphic events, the older of which was probably at rather \nhigh grade on the basis of the metamorphic zircon morphology.  \n \nMAZ12020, Sierra de Maz (29\u02da15' 37.3'', 68\u02da22' 19.6''). This is an alkali-calcic, high-K meta-\nmonzonitic (meta-mangerite) orthogneiss (Fig. 4b, c). Its main mineralogy is Pl \u2013 Hbl \u2013 Grt \u2013 \nQtz (< 20%) \u2013 Bt, with accessory Ttn, Czo, Ilm, Zrn and Ap. The metamorphic assemblage \nGrt + Bt + Pl + Hbl indicates garnet amphibolite facies conditions. \nThe zircons from this sample are notably elongate, subhedral grains, up to 400 \u00b5m in \nlength, most with sub-round terminations. Many grains have colourless inclusions of ?apatite. \nThe CL images show either simple oscillatory zoning or areas with broad zones, sometimes \nrimmed by oscillatory zonation. These features are interpreted as reflecting a single igneous \nzircon crystallisation event. The 19 grains analysed, including cores and rims to 3 structured \ngrains, yield concordant to near-concordant data (Fig. 12a, Table 4). Eighteen of the 21 areas \nanalysed form a single concordant grouping to within analytical uncertainty, giving a \nConcordia age of 1092 \u00b1 6 Ma (MSWD = 0.23), which constrains the time of igneous zircon \ncrystallisation.  There is no evidence within these zircon grains for metamorphic growth. \nHowever the subhedral grain shape and sub-round nature of terminations suggests that the \nigneous intrusion occurred close to peak metamorphic conditions as observed elsewhere.  \n \nMAZ12072, Sierra de Maz (29\u02da18' 15.9'', 68\u02da21' 37.7''). This rock is an alkali-calcic, high-K, \nmeta-quartz monzonitic orthogneiss (Fig. 4). The main mineralogy is Kfs \u2013 Pl \u2013 Qtz \u2013 Bt \u2013 \nGrt, with accessory Ap, Zr, Ttn, Op and All. The rock shows a mylonitic fabric, with Kfs \nporphyroclasts surrounded by a mantle of recrystallized feldspar, polycrystalline quartz \nribbons and lepidoblastic biotite aggregates. The fabric suggests a medium-grade \n 19\nmetamorphism (Grt-Bt) developed during ductile deformation in a shear zone, affecting a \nprotolith of porphyritic granite or subvolcanic porphyries.  \nThe zircons from this sample range from relatively small, equant anhedral grains to \nelongate subhedral forms with sub-round terminations, ranging up to 500\u00b5m in length. The \nlarger grains tend to have irregular grain boundaries and rare grains have central cavities \nconsistent with the entrapment of vapour phases during rapid crystallisation in a volcanic \nsetting. The CL images show either a dominant simple oscillatory zoning or a mixture of this \nand broad more homogeneous internal structure, the latter common in volcanic zircon grains. \nSome grains have thin metamorphic overgrowths, and this gives rise to the irregular grains \nshapes noted above. \nThe areas analysed do not yield a simple well-grouped cluster on the Wetherill plot, \nsuch as that seen in sample MAZ12020. Rather, there is some dispersion in both 207Pb\/206Pb \nand 206Pb\/238U ages (Fig. 12b). The U contents range from ca. 60 to ca. 525 ppm, most being \nbetween 60 and 130 ppm; Th\/U ratios are in the normal range for igneous zircon. Despite the \nlow U content, the radiogenic 207Pb\/206Pb ratios and ages are moderately well defined, but the \nprobability density plot highlights some dispersion and tailing on the younger age side of the \ndominant age group. This is probably a consequence of the high-grade metamorphic \noverprint, leading to modification of the original igneous zircon and giving rise to some \nradiogenic Pb loss and thin newly-formed metamorphic zircon. Notwithstanding this \ndispersion, a weighted mean for 21 of the 23 analyses reported in the Table gives 1086 \u00b1 10 \nMa (MSWD = 1.2) and this provides an estimate for the time of zoned igneous zircon \ncrystallisation. \n \nSPP2067, Sierra de Pie de Palo (31\u02da29' 12.0'', 68\u02da10' 51.0''). This is a subalkaline, calcic, \nmetagabbro-diorite (Fig. 8). The main mineralogy is Hbl \u2013 Pl \u2013 Bt \u00b1 Kfs \u00b1 Qtz \u2013 Czo, Ttn - \n 20\nZrn, with accessory Ttn and Zrn. The fabric is dominated by porphyroblasts of pale green \nclino-amphiboles and brown-orange biotites set in a fine granoblastic fabric of Pl, Qtz and \nCzo. The separated zircons are tabular prismatic grains, mostly with broken terminations and \nfragments of grains commonly seen in zircons from gabbroic rocks. The grains are usually \ndark in colour and some have central cavities consistent with trapping of vapour phases \nduring rapid crystallisation. The CL images show a fairly simple internal structure of \ndominantly length-parallel zonation consistent with a simple igneous origin. U contents are \nquite high (mostly >300 ppm) giving rise to well-defined radiogenic 207Pb\/206Pb ratios and \nages in the SHRIMP analyses at ca. 1 Ga; Th\/U ratios are relatively uniform around 0.20\u2013\n0.25.  All 10 grains analysed yield coincident and concordant U-Pb data (Fig.12c) and a \nConcordia age of 1196 \u00b1 8 Ma (MSWD =1.6). This is significantly older than the two \northogneiss samples from Sierra de Maz and indicates an older period of gabbroic zircon \ncrystallisation. \n \nSPP6076, Sierra de Pie de Palo (31\u00ba 14\u2019 06\u2019\u2019, 68\u00ba 05\u2019 18\u2019\u2019). This is a calc-alkaline mylonitic \northogneiss of granodioritic composition (Fig. 8); its main mineralogy is Kfs \u2013 Qtz \u2013 Pl \u2013 Bt \u2013 \nMs, with accessory Ep, Zrn, Ap and Op. The rock displays a conspicuous mylonitic fabric \nwith \uf073-type Kfs porphyroclasts, fish-type muscovite and euhedral epidote, surrounded by a \nrecrystallized matrix of biotite and quartz. \nThe zircons from this sample are equant to elongate grains, subhedral to euhedral, most \nwith sub-round terminations, or are fragments of such grains. They are notably smaller than \ngrains in the other samples, being generally \u2264100 \u00b5m in length. The CL images show a range \nof internal structures. Most have oscillatory zoning, or length-parallel zones consistent with \nan igneous paragenesis. However, many have a two-part internal structure with either bright \nCL zoned centres and darker CL zoned outer or rim components. Some grains have an \n 21\noutermost rim or zone with dark, more homogeneous CL. The areas analysed have relatively \nhigh U contents, ranging from ca. 215 to ca. 1280 ppm, mostly more than 500 ppm U. Th\/U \nratios are generally in the range ca. 0.1\u20130.45 with several grains having ratios \u22640.07; grains 5 \nand 19 being the lowest at 0.04 and 0.05 respectively. On a standard Wetherill concordia plot \n(Fig. 12d) the data range from concordant within uncertainty to ca. 65% discordant. Note that \nthe analysis of grain 16 is very imprecise and is not considered in this discussion, nor plotted \non Fig. 12d. Nineteen of the remaining 22 analyses define a simple Pb-loss discordia line with \nan upper intercept at 1110 \u00b1 10 Ma (MSWD 1.4). The lower concordia intercept for this line \nat ca. 77 Ma, albeit with a very large uncertainty, could reflect Andean reactivation but is not \nrelevant to the Grenville-age history. Three analyses plot to the younger-age side of the \ndominant discordia regression line and it is notable that two of these have the lowest Th\/U \nratios (grains 5 and 19). The third analysis (grain 23) also has a low Th\/U ratio of 0.11, but \nthere are no distinguishing morphological or CL features to indicate that these 3 analysed \nareas are otherwise different from those within uncertainty of the dominant Pb loss discordia \nline. The three analyses scatter about a line that has an upper intercept at about 1055 Ma \n(MSWD  6.7, not shown on Fig.12d). The upper concordia intercept for zoned igneous zircon \nat 1110 \u00b1 10 Ma is considered to be the best estimate of the protolith age, with indications that \na younger metamorphic overprint has given rise to non-zero age radiogenic Pb loss. \n \nSPP414a, Sierra de Pie de Palo (31\u02da18' 40.0'', 69\u02da55' 45.0''). This subalkaline, aluminous \nmeta-trondhjemite (Fig.8) from the imbricate thrust domain belongs to an orthogneiss suite \nthat yielded a Rb\u2013Sr whole-rock isochron age of 1021 \u00b1 12 Ma (Pankhurst & Rapela, 1998); \nit was analysed on SHRIMP as a further control and comparison with the other more recent \nsamples. The main mineralogy is Pl - Qtz - Kfs - Bt - Anf - Grt1- Grt2; accessories are All, \nEp, Ap, and Zrn and the metamorphic assemblage is Grt2 - Bt -Anf. The granular texture is \n 22\ndominated relict crystals of plagioclase and granular quartz. Two different types of garnet are \nrecognized: Grt1 (igneous?) which is larger, subhedral and devoid of inclusions, and Grt2 \n(metamorphic), smaller, poikilitic and euhedral, and associated with Bt and Anf.  \nThe zircons from this sample are dominantly metamict elongate, subhedral grains. They \nare mostly are dark and clouded with alteration products, but a few grains are clear, or there \nare clear areas on the tips to otherwise metamict zircon. The CL images reinforce the \nmetamict nature of most of the zircon; the few clear areas have weak zoning, but most are \ndark and featureless. U contents are high, ranging from ca. 500 to 1440 ppm, mostly greater \nthan 900 ppm U. Th contents vary widely, with the Th\/U ratio ranging from ca. 0.004 to 0.65; \nmost are < 0.07 suggesting that the zircon areas analysed are of a metamorphic origin. As may \nbe expected from the analyses of such metamict and U-rich zircons, most of the analyses are \ndiscordant (up to ca. 35%), although 13 are only 10 % discordant or less. A regression line \nfitted to all 19 areas analysed has excess scatter (MSWD =3.2) with an upper concordia \nintercept at 1027 \u00b1 17 Ma (Fig. 12e).  The lower concordia intercept of 166 \u00b1 94 Ma is of \ndoubtful geological significance. A weighted mean of 207Pb\/206Pb ages for the least discordant \ngroup gives 1025 \u00b1 10 Ma (MSWD =1.7). This is in agreement with the published Rb\u2013Sr age, \nbut is significantly younger than any other Grenville-age event so far determined from the \nWestern Sierras Pampeanas (see Fig. 13). On the basis of the CL images and Th\/U ratios it is \nlikely that this reflects a period of metamorphic zircon growth, although it must be noted that \nthe metamict nature of the grains indicates that even the more concordant of analyses may \nhave lost radiogenic Pb during a late Grenville-age fluid movement or thermal episode. \n \nULLU2100, Precordillera (37\u00ba 28\u2019 34.01\u2019\u2019; 68\u00ba 49\u2019 27.07\u2019\u2019). This sample is of a metamorphic \nxenolith within a Miocene diorite intruded through the Precordillera sequence and cropping \nout at Ull\u00fan, as described by Abruzzi et al. (1993) and Kay et al. (1996). The sample is a calc-\n 23\nalkaline metagabbro (Fig. 8c), and geochemically it corresponds to the mafic amphibolite \ngroup described by those authors. Its main mineralogy consists of Pl \u2013 Hbl \u2013 Cum\/Tr \u2013 Bt \u2013 \nQtz , with accessories Ep, Zrn, Op and quite common alteration to Chl, Ilm and sericite. The \nfabric is formed by a coarse-grained equigranular aggregate of Hb, Pl and clusters of fibrous \nCum\/Tr clino-amphiboles, probably replacing primary Fe-Mg pyroxene.  \nThe zircons from this sample are quite unusual. Under transmitted light there are two \ndistinct types: a relatively clear anhedral component that forms discrete, larger elongate to \nsub-equant grains, and a component that is inclusion-rich, in places metamict. The inclusion-\nrich zircon occurs as elongate to sub-equant, smaller grains that have round to sub-round grain \nshapes. In places, the clear component can be seen to rim the other. The CL images highlight \nthese markedly different zircon types. The clear zircon is seen as very bright luminescent rims \nand whole grains. The inclusion-rich component has mottled and very irregular darker CL \ncharacteristics, often rimmed by the bright CL component. In some large grains (grains 6 & 7) \nboth rims and cores have bright CL.  \nThe analyses of these complex zircon grains concentrated on the bright CL areas, the \ndark mottled CL areas being considered metamict and so unlikely to yield consistent or \nmeaningful U-Pb data. Nevertheless, for completeness, some dark mottled CL areas were \nanalysed (see Table 4). Overall there appears to be little correlation between age (207Pb\/206Pb \nor 206Pb\/238U) and spot location, though in general terms the whole clear grains tend to give \nolder ages, greater than 1130 Ma. On the other hand, two clear grains (2 and 4) give Cambro-\nOrdovician dates that undoubtedly reflect the late history of the Precordillera terrane. There is \nalso little correlation between grain type or CL characteristics and U content; some light CL \nrims have >500 ppm U, others <200 ppm U; overall the Th\/U ratios are in the range ca. 0.2 \u2013 \n0.45, which is normal for igneous zircon. The enlarged Wetherill concordia plot shown as Fig. \n12f excludes the two Palaeozoic grains (2 and 4), the normally discordant analysis of grain 3 \n 24\nand the reversely discordant, dark CL core to grain 10 (metamict). The data on this plot form \ntwo distinct groupings that are concordant to within analytical uncertainty and distinguished \nin the relative probability plot of 206Pb\/238U ages (shown inset). One group is concordant at \nabout 1165 Ma and the other at about 1060 Ma, with a further subgroup of two discordant \nanalyses (Fig.12f) that have similar 206Pb\/238U ratios to the ca. 1165 Ma group, but with older \n207Pb\/206Pb ratios and ages (the inner light CL cores, analyses 6.2 and 7.3). Whilst it is \nrecognised that these are complex zircons that exhibit atypical CL characteristics and \nstructure and ensuing U-Pb systematics, we suggest that the older grouping at ca. 1165 Ma \nprovides an estimate for zircon crystallisation in the gabbroic protolith of this metamorphic \nxenolith, whereas the ca. 1060 Ma group reflects a period of zircon growth during \nmetamorphism. \n \n6. Discussion: the geodynamic history of the Western Sierras Pampeanas  \n \n A summary of the main lithotectonic elements recognized in the Sierra de Maz and \nSierra de Pie de Palo-Ull\u00fan sectors of the WSP is shown in Figure 13, based on U\u2013Pb \nSHRIMP dating of igneous and metamorphic events obtained in representative samples of the \ndifferent magmatic series identified in each sector (Figs. 4-12). Due to the very complex \nstructural imbrication and the several overprinted events recorded in the WSP, the scenario \ndepicted in Fig. 13 must be tested in future detailed studies of the WSP. \n The oldest igneous event registered in the WSP is represented by suites of dioritic to \ngranitic subalkaline orthogneisses of Sierra de Maz (ca. 1330-1260 Ma, Figs. 4a and 11). \nThese rocks are characteristic of Andean-style I-type granites intruded in a continental crust \n(see section 4.1.1). Metasedimentary rocks in the SE sector of the Maz Domain that are likely \nthe country rocks of this series contain 1.7\u20131.9 Ga detrital zircons, indicating a Late \nPaleoproterozoic source for the metasedimentary envelope, and early Paleoproterozoic Nd \n 25\nmodel ages (Casquet et al., 2006, 2008). There is no evidence to constrain the length of time \ntaken by this event. Taking into account that the granitic suite is relatively abundant and that \nzircon metamorphic overgrowths in the country rocks range from 1180 to 1230 Ma (Casquet \net al., 2006), the duration of this first stage of continental-edge magmatism has been \ntentatively extended to approximately 1230 Ma (Fig. 13). \n No similar continental edge environment has been identified in Sierra de Pie de Palo \nwhere, in contrast, the oldest rocks (gabbro SPP2067, 1196 \u00b1 8 Ma, Fig. 12c; Vujovich et al. \n2004 reported an age of 1204 \u00b1 8 Ma in similar rocks) show clear geochemical evidence of \nhaving formed in an oceanic arc\/back-arc environment (Vujovich & Kay, 1998, Vujovich et \nal., 2004) (see Fig. 9a & 9b). Fig. 13 shows the arc\/back-arc oceanic system of Pie Palo \nevolving separately from the Andino-type margin inferred for Sierra de Maz. The different \ncomposition between the juvenile oceanic Sierra de Pie de Palo and the continental, mature \nenvironment of Sierra de Maz, is well depicted by their contrasting Nd isotopic signatures \n(Fig. 6). The juvenile tonalite-trondhjemites of the Las Matras block, further south (Fig. 1), \nsuggest an oceanic arc at ca. 1244 Ma (Sato et al., 2004), either as an earlier stage of the Pie \nde Palo system, or as an independent arc (Fig. 13).  \nAn important amphibolite facies metamorphic event affected the metadiorite \nMAZ7099, and produced an age peak ca. 1175 Ma defined by concordant spots in well-\ndeveloped metamorphic zircon rims (Fig. 11). Metamorphic rims defining a coeval peak at ca. \n1180 Ma and an older one at ca. 1230 Ma were reported in garnet schists and basic granulites \nwithin a different sliver of the Maz Central Domain (Casquet et al., 2006). Granulite facies \n(780\u02daC, 780 MPa) and a crustal depth of ca. 29 km were calculated for this Grenville-age \nmetamorphism (Casquet et al., 2006), which is here ascribed to an arc-continent collision in \nthe Sierra de Maz sector (Fig. 13). After the collision, the early continental edge of Sierra de \nMaz became a deformed foreland environment and the site of intraplate continental \n 26\nmagmatism. The inferred suture between the continent and the accreted oceanic arc is not \nexposed, but was probably a weakly sheared zone, reactivated by major transcurrent faults \nduring the Cambrian? docking of the WSP against the R\u00edo de la Plata Craton (Rapela et al., \n2007, Casquet et al., 2008c).  \nNo equivalent overprinted coeval metamorphic rims have been so far found in the \nanalysed rocks of the Sierra de Pie de Palo\u2013Ull\u00fan sector and the Las Matras block (Sato et al., \n2000), suggesting that these arc and arc\/back-arc systems were not directly involved in the \nMaz arc-continent collision. What is so far found at ca. 1170 Ma in this sector is the evidence \nof a new convergent event given by (i) 1169 \u00b1 8 Ma tonalite\/granodiorite sills and dykes \nintruded into the basic arc\/back-arc sequence of Sierra de Pie de Palo (Vujovich et al., 2004) \nand (ii) basic arc magmatism in the Precordillera (ULLU2100, ca. 1165 Ma, Fig. 12f, 13). \nOceanic-arc subduction was operating at the time an arc-continent collision occurred in the \nMaz sector, suggesting either they were two independent arc systems or that the Pie de Palo-\nUll\u00fan sector is a southern (present coordinates) remnant branch of the same arc system, not \naffected by the collision. The Ull\u00fan sector has been considered as an oceanic arc\/back-arc \nenvironment near a continental margin (Kay et al. 1996).  \n A new episode of convergence in the Pie de Palo\u2013Ull\u00fan sector is represented by 1110 \n\u00b1 10 Ma calc-alkaline orthogneisses (SPP6076, Figs. 8b, 12d, 13) and mafic amphibolite \nxenoliths (1102 \u00b1 6 Ma, Kay et al., 1996). These ages overlap within errors, and suggest that \nthe Pie de Palo outcrops and the Ull\u00fan xenoliths belonged to the same basement at that time. \nCompared with the previous (ca. 1200 Ma) subduction event of Pie de Palo, the calc-alkaline \ngneisses show a relatively high La\/Yb ratio (Fig. 10), suggesting a plagioclase-poor mineral \nresidue formed in a thicker crust. This event probably affected large sectors of the WSP, taken \ninto account that a suite of 1108 \u00b1 13 Ma calc-alkaline orthogneisses with similar \ngeochemical characteristics (Fig. 10a,b), has been also reported in Sierra de Umango (Varela \n 27\net al. 2003) (Fig. 10a, b). Altogether the widespread ca.1100 episode suggests that the Pie de \nPalo\u2013Ull\u00fan sector was accreted or adjacent to the continent at that age.  \nA final Mesoproterozoic subduction event is represented by the 1027 \u00b1 17 Ma Mogote \nCorralito tonalite-trondhjemite gneisses (Figs. 12e, 13), which show low [La\/Yb]N between \n2.4\u20132.9 (Fig. 9c), indicating a source located above the garnet stability field and therefore \nwithin thin crust. An important tectonic event must have taken place between these two \nyounger convergent episodes, to explain their contrasting geochemical signature. Such a \nsignificant magmatic event is represented in Sierra de Maz by the 1070\u20131090 intraplate \nintrusion of AMCG complexes (Fig. 13). The age of the 1070 \u00b1 41 Ma massif anorthosite of \nSierra de Maz (Casquet et al., 2004) overlaps within errors both the 1092 \u00b1 6 Ma meta-\nmangerite (MAZ12020, Fig. 12a) and the ca.1088 Ma meta-granite (MAZ12072, Fig. 12b) \nreported here, and interpreted collectively as an AMCG complex. The large uncertainty in the \nanorthosite age does not allow to confirmation they are truly coeval, but if this interpretation \nis correct the age of the whole complex would be ca. 1090 Ma, i.e., the age of the more \nprecisely dated meta-mangerite. Intrusion of these slightly contaminated mantle-derived \nmagmas during a widespread extensional episode would have produced an important thermal \noverprint in surrounding rocks. The 1330-1260 Ma metagranitic suite located close to the \nAMCG complex (see Fig. 2) shows a peak age of zircon mantle overgrowths at 1095 Ma (Fig. \n11). The mafic granulite xenoliths of the Precordillera show zircon metamorphic overgrowths \nat ca. 1060 Ma (Fig. 12f), and the 1102 \u00b1 6 Ma mafic amphibolite xenolith contains two \nzircon fractions with significantly lower U and Pb concentration, interpreted as a \nmetamorphic event at ~ 1083 Ma (Kay et al., 1996). This evidence points to a regional \nthermal event that we here relate to the ponding of mantle magmas at the base of the crust and \nthe intrusion of AMCG complexes during an extensional episode (Fig. 13). Intramontane \nbasins most probably formed during this episode, and should therefore contain only pre-1060 \n 28\nMa detrital zircons, as is the case of the Morteritos schists in Sierra de El Gigante (Rapela et \nal., 2007).  \n Despite the structurally complex imbrication produced by the Paleozoic and Mesozoic \n(Andean) orogenies, the inferred major Mesoproterozoic geological events and their timing \nseem to define a protracted but coherent geodynamic history for the Western Sierras \nPampeanas. This started at ca. 1330 Ma and ended at ca. 1030 Ma with convergent events at a \ncontinental margin, and included between these limits the formation of oceanic arc\/back arc \ncomplexes, arc-continent collisions, renewed subduction and an intraplate extensional episode \nwith intrusion of AMCG complexes. This is the history of a complex, composite arc system \ndeveloped facing a long-lived ocean..  \n Although the issues of provenance of the Western Sierras Pampeanas and their \noriginal links with other Grenville-age orogens of the terrane collage are beyond the scope of \nthis work, it is necessary to mention that several of the stages described above have been \ninterpreted as evidence for Laurentian provenance, e.g., the basement of the Precordillera \n(Kay et al., 1996), the arc\/back-arc sequence of Sierra de Pie de Palo (Vujovich & Kay, 1998) \nand the massif-type anorthosites of the Sierra de Maz Central Domain (Casquet et al., 2004), \namong others. There is no doubt that several of the geodynamic entities identified in the \nWestern Sierras Pampeanas (Fig.13) have also been described in the Laurentian Grenville \nbelt, such as Andean calc-alkaline magmatic arcs and coeval back-arc deposits, as well as \nepisodes of extension and intrusion of AMCG complexes, the youngest of which was \nemplaced at ca. 1090\u20131050 Ma (Rivers, 1997; Corrigan and Hanmer, 1997) and was thus \nbroadly coeval with the Maz AMCG complex (Fig. 13). Nevertheless, as Rodinia \nreconstruction is still a matter of speculative debate, these comparisons should be taken with \ncaution. For example, an arc-continent collision at ca. 1170 Ma and an important \nmetamorphism bracketed at ca. 1090\u20131050 Ma have been identified in the Natal-Namaqua \n 29\nbelt of southern Africa (Jacobs et al., 2003 and references therein), which in some \nreconstruction is placed facing the Grenville orogen. Both of these events are conspicuous \nfeatures now identified in the Western Sierras Pampeanas.  \n7. Conclusions \n \n The study of Mesoproterozoic rocks of the sierras of Maz and Pie de Palo reveals a \nprotracted (300-Ma long) geological history. As these terrains represent contrasting crustal \nenvironments that sometimes experienced coeval events, it is possible to reconstruct and \ninterpret their episodic evolution. Sierra de Maz seems to have been part of a continental crust \nthroughout this period, starting as a Paleoproterozoic continental margin during Andean type-\nsubduction at least 1330 Ma ago. This margin became a foreland intraplate site after an arc-\ncontinent collision, developing high-grade metamorphism at 1230-1170 Ma. During an \nextensional event defining the culmination of the Mesoproterozoic history in the Maz region, \nthe intrusion of ca. 1050\u20131090, mantle-derived, intraplate AMCG complexes produced a \nstrong thermal overprint on previous continental-arc suites. On the other hand, the \nMesoproterozoic sequences of the Sierra de Pie de Palo\u2013Ull\u00fan sector are dominated by \noceanic arc and back-arc rocks, which were products of a fully developed and active arc \nsystem ca. 1200 Ma ago. A new subduction event at ~1170 Ma overprinted the old arc\/back-\narc, while a 1110 Ma episode seems to have been emplaced into crust that had become more \nmature. Now located at the continental margin, the juvenile accreted terranes underwent later \nemplacement of subduction-related plutons at 1027 Ma. As in other Grenville-age terrains, the \ngeodynamic history of the Mesoproterozoic WSP is dominated by convergent tectonics, either \nat continental margins or intra-oceanic arcs, with episodes of arc-continent collisions and \nemplacement of AMCG complexes during extensional events.  \n  \nAcknowledgements \n \n 30\nFinancial support for this paper was provided by Spanish MEC grants BTE2001-1486 \nand CGL2005-02065\/BTE, Universidad Complutense grant PR1\/05-13291 and Argentine \ngrants PIP-CONICET 5719 and FONCYT PICT 2006-1009.
