It is variously defined in exist-\ning literature (SCONUL, 1999; Big Blue Project, 2002) and responsibility for it\nranges from its traditional roots in bibliographic instruction from library professionals\nto dedicated academic courses provided by information science academics (Webber\n& Johnston, 2000). As more students engage with online learning, however, there is\na need to ensure all students benefit from information literacy education, not just\nthose who have access to academic or library-run courses that frequently remain\nvoluntary.\nTo make the case for the need for information literacy, at a recent conference\n(Oxford University Learning Technologies Group, 2004) the first theme in the call\n*Corresponding author. Department of Electronic & Electrical Engineering, Torrington Place,\nLondon, WC1E 6JE, UK. Email: jsmith@ee.ucl.ac.uk\n50 J. Smith and M. Oliver\nfor proposals asked whether we understood student behaviour relating to online\nresources. As Jones et al. (2004) say, little work has been done in this regard, despite\na great deal of activity in the broader area of online learning. A number of studies have\nfocused on the needs of library and information professionals or the systems develop-\nment communities (Rowley, 2003), and increasingly academic\u2013librarian partnerships\nare reported (McGuinness, 2003) that can sometimes be problematic (Godwin,\n2003). What is currently missing from the literature, however, is any kind of educa-\ntional development perspective. To begin to explore student behaviour from an\neducational perspective, this paper reports the results of a small-scale study that aimed\nto investigate an example of current information literacy provision by observing\nstudent behaviour in the online environment with a view to future enhancement. An\nexisting taught course focusing on effective use of the Internet was analysed in relation\nto Bruce\u2019s (1997) \u2018seven faces of information literacy\u2019 framework to see whether such\ncourses are useful in developing students\u2019 conceptions of information literacy.\nThis paper is structured around an introduction to information literacy and the\nanalytic framework used, a description of the course, summaries of pre-course and\npost-course questionnaires, and case studies of student behaviour. The case studies\nand student post-course self-report lead into a discussion of what can be achieved by\nstand-alone courses and the benefits of contextualising information literacy educa-\ntion in relation to two major factors: students\u2019 home disciplines and their academic\nmaturity.\nThe need for information literacy\nThe popularity of the Internet, and particularly the recent explosive growth in Virtual\nLearning Environment usage, has led to unparallelled numbers of staff using online\nresources in learning and teaching situations (Armitage & O\u2019Leary, 2003). This\nchange in activity means both staff and students need to develop information-seeking\nbehaviours not needed in the past, particularly in relation to quality, reliability and\nrepresentativeness, given the potentially unmediated nature of online information\n(Walton & Archer, 2004). The effort now going in to producing, finding and\n(re)using such resources has an impact on the practices of both academic staff and\nstudents. Most studies investigating information behaviour, however, stem from\nlibrary and information professionals (Martin & Rader, 2003) rather than educational\nresearchers (Virkus, 2003). It is timely, therefore, to investigate information literacy\nfrom an educative rather than informational perspective.\nFor students, the world of online information in relation to their studies is a\ncomplex one (Macdonald et al., 2001). As will be seen from this study, they arrive in\nhigher education with limited awareness of the tools and resources available to them\n(Rowley, 2000). Many will suffer from their lecturers\u2019 unjustified assumptions that\nfinding and using online resources is a simple issue. A second common misconcep-\ntion, conceptualised as the \u2018Nintendo generation\u2019 (Morice, 2000, cited in Conole,\n2002a) is that students\u2019 facility with technology in other domains\u2014notably game\nplaying\u2014equips them with enough awareness for the rather more limited technology\nStudent perceptions of information literacy 51\nuse expected in higher education. This appears to manifest itself in the abandonment\nof introductory computing courses (Stephens & Creaser, 2002).\nCurrently, however, there are few studies that investigate the role of online\nresources in the learning process, although there are many that focus on access and,\noften, equate this to usage. While access statistics are critical from an information\nprofessional perspective (Rowley, 2003)\u2014in terms of renewing or terminating\nsubscriptions, or tailoring services to user needs\u2014in terms of learning, they tell us\nlittle. The area of information studies has also undertaken work reflecting how indi-\nviduals find and use information (Wilson et al., 1999). However, such studies focus\non specific needs\u2014for instance, in relation to health information\u2014and start from an\nassumption that the individual has a specific information need, and this will be closely\nrelated to a particular cause, circumstance or interest, for which more is needed to be\nknown. There is little in the area that characterises information search or use behav-\niour in relation to educational theory, pedagogic design or learning processes. As\nMcDowell (2002) suggests, staff are reluctant, even in this new \u2018information econ-\nomy\u2019, to require or value student initiative in this complex area. With pressure on\nacademic staff to use and produce digital material (Oliver, 2003), there is, as yet, little\nevidence that students will persevere to find and use online resources in support of\ntheir studies.\nThe move to more student-centred forms of learning (Thorpe, 2002), including\ncollaborative working in online environments, has led to a focus on situated theo-\nries of learning (Lave & Wenger, 1991; Wenger, 1998). Work done by Becher and\nTrowler (2001) highlights how norms and practices vary across disciplines. Lave\nand Wenger (1991) describe \u2018legitimate peripheral participation\u2019 as a way of assimi-\nlating such practices, which suggests that they do not cross disciplinary boundaries\neasily. This may raise issues for information literacy education if it is conceptual-\nised as a learning process, a form of enculturation, rather than as a set of generic\nskills.\nTo date, traditional educational theorists have not focused on the role of external\nresources, online or otherwise, in the learning process. Wenger, in proposing his\ntheory of communities of practice (1998), explicitly considers artefacts, be they\nobjects, documents or practices and shows how they become reified\u2014representations\nof practice specific to particular communities. This suggests that information literacy\nneeds to be embedded in a disciplinary context and thus is unlikely to be equally\ndefinable and applicable across a range of disciplines.\nHowever, current approaches to the use of external resources in learning\nprocesses\u2014loosely termed information literacy\u2014take two forms: the checklist\napproach, or the stand-alone subject approach. For example, the Association of\nCollege and Research Libraries (2000) has developed a set of competency standards\ncovering five standards and 22 performance indicators. This model implies a checklist\napproach through which students will demonstrate observable skills rather than\nknowledge or understanding, possibly just once throughout their undergraduate\nstudies. To illustrate the second form, Webber and Johnston (2000) suggest informa-\ntion literacy be taught as a stand-alone subject that should be led by information\n52 J. Smith and M. Oliver\nscientists. While this approach allows students to investigate their own conceptions of\ninformation literacy, it locates the topic in the domain of information science rather\nthan within the students\u2019 chosen discipline with, as yet, little evidence of the transfer\nof skills or understanding from one domain to another (Barnett, 1994).\nThe seven faces of information literacy model\nChristine Bruce\u2019s seven faces of information literacy was a phenomenographic\nstudy with staff to understand practices in information behaviour (Bruce,\n1997). She interviewed staff across a range of disciplines in Australian universi-\nties to capture their understandings of the role of information sources and\nproduced a seven-stage model that gives a useful taxonomy whereby we can\nconceptualise how online resources are experienced. Her hierarchical model,\nranging from technologically-orientated to wisdom-orientated positions, is repro-\nduced in Table 1.\nLittle is said, however, about movement through or across the categories; nor does\nBruce investigate how, when or whether staff make value judgements about the\nfitness for purpose of any resources they encounter. It is potentially the case that\nstudents may fit these categories too, and that their experiences of, and success in,\ntheir studies could be enhanced by a better understanding of what role and use they\nmake of information sources\u2014how they develop their information literacy\u2014along-\nside their disciplinary knowledge.\nThe study described in this paper was undertaken to explore these issues in a generic,\nuniversity-wide course. Specifically, the primary aim of the study was to investigate\nTable 1.

A range of tools and electronic resources is introduced in the taught compo-\nnent: whether and how these are applied in practice and students\u2019 post-course\nconceptions of the role of electronic resources were explored through the data collec-\ntion methods detailed below.\nMethodology\nThe focus for this study was a taught elective, the \u2018Information Sources and How\nto Use Them\u2019 course available to a multidisciplinary intake across all years of study\nwithin a metropolitan, research-led institution in the United Kingdom. The course\nis structured around the process of finding information, using it to create a bibliog-\nraphy and then presenting this both on paper and via the Web. Among other\nthings, the curriculum introduces a variety of information sources including search\nengines, managed hubs, gateways, bibliographic databases and image libraries. It is\ntaught by Library and Information Studies academics and assessment is by anno-\ntated bibliography on a topic of the student\u2019s own choice, presented in paper and\nWeb-based form and accompanied by a reflection on the efficacy\u2014or otherwise\u2014\nof the information-seeking and evaluation processes. Initially, 45 students regis-\ntered for the course and 37 attended. The majority of them were first-year Infor-\nmation Management (IM) students (from the home department) but there was\nalso a substantial minority from Chemistry, Biology, Linguistics and Literature,\nCommunication Science and affiliate (Erasmus) students. All of the students from\noutside the home department were in years two, three or four of their programmes.\n(This had implications for the inferences that could be drawn, as will be discussed\nlater.)\nAs a taught course requiring attendance, it appeared that access to a stable group\nof students, together with multiple sampling opportunities, had been negotiated.\nHowever, variable attendance was the norm as students were split into two laboratory\ngroups and the timing of the course (in term two) meant that planned post-course\ninterviews were not possible as students went on study leave. The small numbers\ninvolved and limited previous work in this area means the study is thus necessarily\nexploratory in nature.\nMethods\nTo compliment the work done with staff (Bruce, 1997; Johnston & Webber, 2003;\nMcDowell, 2002), students were asked to complete pre-course and post-course ques-\ntionnaires, and laboratory session observations were undertaken. The pre-course\nquestionnaire aimed to elicit students\u2019 existing views regarding online resources while\nthe post-course questionnaire was designed to explore whether these had changed by\nthe end of the course. The laboratory observations were intended to supplement\nquestionnaire data, to gain information about student activities and to be aware of any\ncritical incidents.\n54 J. Smith and M. Oliver\nFindings and discussion\nThe results from the study are reported in chronological order, and have been analy-\nsed in relation to the Bruce (1997) framework to explore whether her phenomeno-\ngraphic categories are relevant to students. The hypothesis underlying this study is\nthat information literacy may vary according to context; that is, a student\u2019s home\ndiscipline or year of study. This point is returned to in the case studies. Initially,\nhowever, we report on responses to a questionnaire that was developed for use before\nthe course began.\nStudents\u2019 preconceptions of information literacy\nThe pre-course questionnaire sought some limited demographic data, relating to\nhome discipline and year of study. As the course is an elective, three questions were\nincluded asking whether students had read the aims and objectives of the course and\nwhich of these they considered most and least important. The questionnaire was\nemailed to students who had registered for the course before the Christmas break\nand, even with two reminders, achieved only a 25% response rate. Two question-\nnaires were returned on paper rather than emailed\u2014this may point to a skills deficit\nfor some students. Worryingly, despite this course being an elective, only three\nstudents admitted to having read the aims and objectives. Two open-ended questions\nallowed students to explain in their own words how they would go about tackling the\nmodule\u2019s assessment task (the production of an annotated bibliography), with a focus\non the resources they would use, and further to explain why they thought this would\nbe a good way to tackle the assignment. In response to the \u2018how\u2019 question, the\nresponses showed a limited awareness of electronic resources. One source of elec-\ntronic information was cited three times: the library, followed by two mentions for\nGoogle. Two students were less specific, mentioning the Internet in general or else\ncompany websites. Only two students cited specific academic tools\u2014SciFinder,\nScience Direct and Athens. Both were from Chemistry.\nClearly, not only was respondents\u2019 awareness of resources limited, there was also\nevidence of confusion as to what constitutes an electronic information source.\nNeither Google (a search engine) nor Athens (an access\/authentication system)\u2014\ntechnically\u2014fit this category, but the students seemed unable to discriminate\nbetween the access method and the information itself. One student mentioned\n\u2018company websites\u2019, indicating that not only is there confusion over sources of infor-\nmation, but distinctions between types of material (promotional versus academic) are\nnot necessarily well understood either.\nThe \u2018why\u2019 question, addressing the students\u2019 information behaviour, again elicited\nlimited and simplistic responses. The most popular explanations were awareness and\nease of use: \u2018they\u2019re the ones I know of\u2019, which was given in relation to Google and\nthe library. Illustrative of the difficulties the students faced, which became apparent\nin the observations, Figure 1 shows how unhelpful a standard interface is in support-\ning students as they develop their information literacy. All the feedback focused on\nStudent perceptions of information literacy 55\none issue\u2014they do not know what ERIC, MLA or ICONDA are\u2014and all any of the\nstudents could say is, \u2018where do I start?\u2019.\nFigure 1. A screenshot from library pages showing database subscriptionsWhen we consider issues surrounding ease of use, the immediate contrast between\nFigures 2 and 3 give us a powerful indication of the charm of basic Web searching\nversus the conceptual difficulties facing students accessing more sophisticated tools.\nFigure 2. The Google basic search interface\u2014simple and elegant3 JSTOR more challenging for novices than GoogleThe JSTOR interface is instructive in terms of supporting learners. For those new\nto independent information searching, it is illuminating to look at the assumptions\nmade: a familiarity with Boolean searches, with the concept of database fields, and of\nthe journals in specific subject areas. Without this grounding it is easy to see why\nstudents revert to simple and familiar tools. These issues are returned to in the case\nstudies.\nIn the pre-course questionnaire, it was interesting to note that only three students\nmade a value judgement about the resources they had cited: one from IM who noted\nthe accuracy of the library, and the two Chemistry students who appreciated the qual-\nity of the scientific databases noted earlier. \nSciFinder is better than other science programs because it has a larger and more complete\ndatabase.\nSummary of pre-course questionnaires\nResponses to this question were, on the whole, very simplistic. Given the traditional\nage of entry of most students for this course, many of whom have a computing-related\nqualification (often at \u2018A\u2019-level), it is useful to see what the National Curriculum\nFigure 1. A screenshot from library pages showing database subscriptions\n56 J. Smith and M. Oliver\nFigure 2. The Google basic search interface\u2014simple and elegant\nFigure 3. The JSTOR basic search interface\u2014more challenging for novices than Google\nStudent perceptions of information literacy 57\nrequires. The syllabus is clear about developing skills and attitudes in relation to\ninformation finding and expects pupils to experience and evaluate information from\na range of sources. From the pre-course questionnaires, it is clear that either they do\nnot have this experience, or they forget it before they reach university. It is reassuring,\nhowever, that some students were making value judgements of the information they\naccessed, even if these were in the minority before the course.\nCase studies\nFive observations of laboratory sessions were made across the 12-week term when the\nfocus was on information finding. These case studies arise from observations of\nstudent behaviour and concerns as they experienced the course. The aim was to see\nwhether the students displayed behaviour and\/or attitudes that fitted the Bruce\nframework. Analysis of field notes shows that, of the behaviours observed, several\ncases emerged that illustrate the Bruce categories. The observations also uncovered\nimportant issues for consideration in developing information literacy.\nCase study 1: lecturers\u2019 unjustified assumptions\nTwo fourth-year Chemistry students were amazed by the nature and quality of infor-\nmation available to them by using the refined search techniques demonstrated in the\ncourse, both on the Web and through specialist library\/e-journal services. In their\nthird year, Chemistry students undertake a project that is essentially a literature\nreview of a topic of interest to lead them into their wet chemistry project in their final\nyear. The range and quality of resources available were a real revelation to these\nstudents and they were quite outraged that they had not been shown how to search\neffectively in earlier years. Given that only the top 20\u201325% of students continue to a\nfourth-year M.Sci degree, it is instructive to note that they both remarked that they\nhad found their literature projects challenging and time-consuming. They wished\nthey had known about some of the techniques that were made explicit through this\ncourse earlier in their academic careers. Students in this area could be seen as holding\nboth \u2018information process\u2019 and \u2018knowledge construction\u2019 orientations: \nThis course helped me to find all the information I needed for my projects and not only\nfor my degree but for all other information I need in my life\u2014I know where to look.\nI am going to use all I have learned for my graduating thesis research and for my future\nemployment.\nCase study 2: the reversion to Google\nDespite being introduced to a wide range of useful tools and sources\u2014which they\nappeared to enjoy and spent some time exploring\u2014many of the students were\nobserved reverting to Google as their primary search tool. These students seemed to\nlack any perseverance with the less familiar interfaces or techniques demonstrated.\nInterestingly, they were all in years one and two of study. Persevering with the\n58 J. Smith and M. Oliver\nspecifically academic sources used in this course appears to be related to their\nacademic (rather than chronological) maturity. When asked about their behaviour,\nthe students responded that they preferred Google or found it easier to use. As seen\nin Figures 2 and 3, the more academic tools and resources make certain assump-\ntions that do not appear to have been dealt with by this stage of the students\u2019\neducation.\nBeing earlier in their undergraduate careers, they had yet to meet the issues that the\nchemistry students (in case one) had confronted. The students reverting to Google\nmay be characterised as being at the \u2018information sources\u2019 end of Bruce\u2019s spectrum.\nThis behaviour was observed many times during the in-class observation, but from\nthe post-course questionnaires it seems all students who responded were familiar with\nGoogle before the course and now recognised that they needed to look beyond this tool: \nThe most important thing I have learned is that when I plan to research\u2014I should look\nbeyond Google and the main commerical search engines.\nCase study 3: the quality\/quantity dichotomy\nA fourth-year Chemistry student articulated his dissatisfaction with Google search\nresults. Typing in the general topic of his project was giving him hundreds of hits, and\nhe was rightly dubious about the quality and provenance of some of the information\nhe was finding. When introduced to PSIgate (the physical sciences hub funded\nthrough JISC and accessed through the RDN) he tried the same search\u2014and was\ndisappointed to turn up only two hits. Initially, a large information base can be reas-\nsuring to students. However, the difficulties of managing and evaluating large quan-\ntities of new information can encourage students to focus on a much smaller, but\nquality-controlled, literature base. This student had not contemplated this dichotomy\nand was not familiar with the process of follow-up techniques such as using citation\nindexes. He took some persuading that sometimes less is more. The idea of refining\nhis search criteria to specific and more credible domains was immediately of interest\nbut also challenging as there seemed to be a lot less information available. This\nstudent could be categorised as an \u2018information control\u2019 student, trying hard to\nmaster the information landscape for his discipline. Others\u2014in the post-course ques-\ntionnaire\u2014commented along similar lines: \nI have learned the structure of journals \u2026 I have learnt to broaden my horizon \u2026 I have\nlearned how to control the area I am searching in.\nI was pretty much used to using internet search engines \u2026 electronic journal databases\nwere quite a new thing to me and they helped me to find better quality references for all\nthe courses I\u2019m doing.\nCase study 4: the persistence of the information technology conception\nFrom observations and post-course questionnaires, it seems this course has influenced\ninformation-seeking and use behaviour. Most responses and observed behaviour show\nthat students were actively using techniques and tools that had been demonstrated to\nStudent perceptions of information literacy 59\nthem, and post-course most students reported positive experiences that they felt would\ntransfer to other subjects or tasks. Given the focus of the course on information sources,\na small minority, however, seemed to display what Biggs\u2019 (2002) theory of constructive\nalignment calls pre-structural knowledge: the students had missed the point. \nNothing on this course was new to me as I have studied html and site design for many\nyears. (First year, IM)\nIt would be great if talk more about computer language. (Third year, Human Sciences)\nThese comments show that some students remain focused on driving the technology\neven when much more qualitative, complex and potentially judgemental issues are\nbeing stressed. Interestingly, the Human Sciences student also asserted that the course\nhad taught him to surf the Internet and to find books in the library. This may point\nto issues in his home discipline but may also illustrate how long it may take (i.e. beyond\na one-term course) for some students to shift attitude and behaviour in this domain.\nCase study 5: the tacit nature of information literacy\nOne student, a first-year IM student, stood out from the group. In terms of search\ntechnique, the course probably taught her nothing. From day one she was adept and\nfocused. Interestingly, she had never taken a GCSE or A-level in any IT or comput-\ning-related discipline. In Kolbian terms, however, she was a convergent thinker, with\nan innate curiosity about \u2018information\u2019. (Kolb\u2019s [1984] application of his action lean-\ning cycle to disciplinary epistemologies identifies convergent and divergent thinkers\nwho will succeed or fail\u2014relatively speaking\u2014depending on the relationship between\ntheir learning style and their disciplinary choice.) This student, having mastered the\nskills and with an appreciation of the information landscape, uses the course in a way\nthat fits well with Bruce\u2019s \u2018knowledge extension\u2019 category: \nDatabases \u2026 Learnt where to search for specialist subject areas. I found the actual location\n(i.e. URLs) and identification of information sources \u2026 very useful. However, the tech-\nniques for using them I found obvious and self-explanatory.\nHowever, she was utterly unable to articulate how and why this area interested her,\nor how she had learned such sophisticated search techniques. We can view this\nstudent as having been \u2018enculturated\u2019\u2014as described by Wenger (1998) where,\nthrough participation in communities of practice, learning takes place through assim-\nilating the tools and practices of that community. Clearly she had not learnt formally\nthrough the national curriculum. This case may show the value of informal, situated\nlearning that has been devalued by the move to specific and measurable outcomes in\nschool-based IT, which now may be limited to the functional at the expense of any\nform of enculturation.\nCase study summary\nThese five case studies illustrate that students hold multiple perspectives on the Bruce\nspectrum: from information technology to sources, process, control, knowledge\n60 J. Smith and M. Oliver\nconstruction and extension categories. Limited responses to the pre-course question-\nnaire make direct comparisons difficult but it is clear from observations that the\nstudents were, mostly, confronting issues in the information sources domain leading\nto more sophisticated and\/or critical uses of information.\nAttitudes to developing information literacy\nThe post-course questionnaire achieved a 79% rate of return as it was administered\nin class time. Again, apart from some limited demographic data (to align with pre-\ncourse questionnaires and observations), the students were asked open-ended ques-\ntions to allow them to focus on what was taught through the course that had been\nmost useful or valuable to them. The questionnaire followed the same format as the\npre-course instrument and asked students the following: \n\u25cf Please describe what you have learned on this course. Please focus on which\nsources were new to you and how (or whether) you have found these sources\nuseful.\n\u25cf Please describe how you might use what you have learned during this course in the\nremainder of your degree studies, and why this might be so.\n\u25cf Any other comments about electronic resources in general?\nThese data are summarised in Table 2. The comments made have been categor-\nised, rather than the students, reflecting how each individual can belong to more\nthan one of the Bruce phenomenographic categories. This shows that the experi-\nence of online resources is a complex issue, rather than being a one-to-one corre-\nspondence between observed behaviour and an expressed view of resources.\nClearly the course has influenced behaviour if these results are compared with the\non-entry questionnaire, with students offering insights from a wider range of\nexperiences and perspectives. The results in Table 2 are split between students in\ntheir first\/second years and third\/fourth years of study as, from observational data,\nthis appeared to be the key difference between how these groups of students\nTable 2. Student post-course perceptions of information literacy\nPhenomenographic category\nFirst-year and second-year \nstudents\nThird-year and fourth-year \nstudents\nInformation technology 18% 36%\nInformation sources 87% 63%\nInformation process 62% 82%\nInformation control 6% 18%\nKnowledge construction 31% 54%\nKnowledge extension 6% 0%\nWisdom conception 0% 0%\nValue judgements 31% 9%\nStudent perceptions of information literacy 61\nexperienced the course. The results are given in percentages to ameliorate the\nproblems of differential numbers of students from each year or course of study.\nWhat these results show is that, when explaining in their own words, the students\nreveal that they hold multiple perspectives. Consequently, while their responses and\nbehaviour fit into the Bruce framework, it is not possible to categorise them in relation\nto just one conception. In other words, this study has demonstrated that Bruce\u2019s cate-\ngories cannot be used to delineate \u2018types\u2019 of students.\nIt is surprising to find that academically more mature students are more IT-focused\nthan their younger counterparts, but it may be that they have viewed this area in a\nparticularly IT-driven way for longer and thus, for students in later years, more\nsophisticated information literacy attitudes may take longer to develop. Some of the\ndifferential between the two groups in the \u2018control\u2019 and \u2018construction\u2019 categories may\nbe explained by the fact that the younger students are predominantly experiencing\nthis course in the context of an information management environment, whereas non-\nIM students clearly focus more on process and control. Third-year and fourth-year\nstudents will, by necessity, be more concerned with managing information than\nacademically less mature students and\u2014from comments categorised as \u2018knowledge\nconstruction\u2019\u2014focus far more on applying information in their own disciplinary\ncontext. From observations, these students were more focused on information\nsearching for topics very closely related to the object of their disciplinary studies,\nwhereas the first and second years appeared to be investigating a wider range of\nsubjects.\nGiven the small numbers involved, the appearance of one student in the \u2018knowl-\nedge extension\u2019 category gives a 6% return. This end of the Bruce spectrum can easily\nbe seen to be beyond the expectations of an undergraduate curriculum but clearly this\nstudent stood out from her peer group. What may deserve more attention is the\nstudents reporting any kind of value judgement after undergoing the course. The\nattention given to \u2018information overload\u2019 (Conole, 2002b) suggests that an ability to\nevaluate the quality of online resources is key to enhancing student performance in\nthis area. Prior to the course, few students made reference to this aspect of informa-\ntion behaviour, and the proportion commenting on this issue in the post-course ques-\ntionnaire remains low. The Bruce (1997) study does not deal with this issue, although\nit may be implied by her \u2018wisdom\u2019 conception. However, an evaluation of fitness for\npurpose (i.e. a value judgement) is qualitatively different from the notion of using\ninformation wisely. This accords well with Macdonald et al.\u2019s (2001) findings on the\ndifferent experiences of undergraduate and postgraduate students. If an aim of any\nkind of information literacy education is to ensure that students become critical\nconsumers of information, the proportions reported in Table 2 may be interpreted as\nbeing quite low. Consequently, this area may benefit from reinforcement in the\ncourse.\nThe primary objective of the course is to teach students to search the Internet\nefficiently and effectively. Clear majorities of both groups of students comment that\nthe course achieved its aims, as can be seen in the striking increases in awareness\nacross the \u2018sources\u2019 and \u2018process\u2019 categories post-course, presented in Table 3.\n62 J. Smith and M. Oliver\nThe results in Table 3 are encouraging in so far as this existing course is clearly\nmeeting its aims and objectives. However, it does show the difficulties of analysing\nan existing course in relation to a framework that did not guide its development, as\ncan clearly be seen by the results reported in Table 2. Activities were not necessar-\nily provided within the course to demonstrate all the Bruce categories, but the\nsources and processes that were the focus of the course illustrate their success in\nTable 3. Nonetheless, the results also indicate that the Bruce framework may have\nvalue for those charged with designing and developing courses in information liter-\nacy education, to ensure that possibilities for development are provided in all of the\ncategories.\nSummary of post-course questionnaire\nWhat has become clear through this study is that the Bruce framework is a useful\nanalytical model in terms of its relation to theories of learning and as a guide to peda-\ngogic design for courses of this nature. However, the open-ended nature of the ques-\ntionnaire and the student responses to it have shown a weakness in relation to the\nmodel: the defining boundaries between the categories are very fine, potentially very\nblurred. For instance, occurrences of the term \u2018database\u2019 have been problematic as\nsometimes this appears to refer to databases as a tool or technology, while in other\ncases its use appears to refer to sources.\nThere does appear to be a qualitative difference between the disciplinary context of\nstudents and the way they experience the course. Two things suggest themselves here.\nFirst, that information literacy is an iterative process closely related to the object of\nstudy where a just-in-time approach may be useful to students from other disciplines.\nSecond, that information management students may need the value judgement aspect\nof information searching and use reinforced through other aspects of their studies.\nAlthough the numbers involved are quite small, there appears to be a qualitative\ndifference between the academically less and more mature students. This may be\nexplicable by the wider framework of the students\u2014the IM degree (of which most of\nthe first-year and second-year students were part) considers these issues from a broad\nperspective. Students from other disciplines, however, may be subsuming what is\nlearned on this course directly into their disciplinary studies where the enculturation\nTable 3.

Physical science students\naccessed and used a range of discipline-related resources, whereas information\nmanagement students used resources related to a wider range of topics. The course\ndid not seek to define information literacy, choosing instead to focus on an applica-\ntion of a well-respected framework (Bruce, 1997). The course uses a constructivist\napproach to learning and teaching whereby students negotiate a topic of their own\nchoosing on which to be assessed. This allows for a broad view of information sources\nand processes to be developed. What is interesting, however, is that the desire to\ndevelop their information literacy was, in this instance, related to the academic matu-\nrity of the students.\nThere is little doubt that students arrive on this course with a very limited aware-\nness of the high-quality, specialised resources that are available on the Internet. They\nhave poor search techniques and display poor use of bookmarks for organising infor-\nmation. By the end of the course, however, students were using a wider range of\nsources and techniques to access and organise their information sources. Many could\nalso see the applicability of what they had learned to their wider studies, and several\nconcurred with the notion that: \nI am able to find relevant information much more quickly.\nEven given the students\u2019 favourable view of information literacy, there are clearly\nissues of interest to online resource and human\u2013computer interaction designers from\nthis study. The students do not approach the assessment task from a library and infor-\nmation professional view of categorising resources, and some common tools and\ninterfaces make too many assumptions about students\u2019 existing skill levels. Further-\nmore, it would be interesting to follow-up the academically less mature students to\nsee if the course proves beneficial in their later years of study, in the ways remarked\nby the chemistry students who clearly felt they would have benefited from this knowl-\nedge earlier. This investigation of existing information literacy education provision\nhas, therefore, highlighted issues of disciplinary difference in what is thought to be a\ngeneric course. These issues give clear goals to enhancing future provision by rede-\nsigning the teaching of information literacy to include a more situated aspect.\nBruce\u2019s (1997) phenomenographic categories do seem to be a useful way to inter-\npret students\u2019 information literacy levels but clearly have their limitations. Not only\ncan the boundaries between categories become blurred as students relate their expe-\nrience, but the students also demonstrate multiple perspectives. Those charged with\nthe design of information skills\/information literacy courses may find this framework\nuseful, as it suggests pedagogic designs and learning and teaching strategies most\nlikely to support students in developing their information literacy.\n64 J. Smith and M. Oliver\nThe emphasis in this course was on finding and using information. The evaluative\nelement of information literacy does not appear to be as well developed, although it\nis implied through the use of certain tools and techniques, but may benefit from being\nmore explicit. However, the findings from this study also suggest that such decontex-\ntualised courses may focus on specific aspects of the Bruce framework such as sources\nand process, while not catering for the higher-level understanding we may wish to\nencourage.\nAcknowledgements\nThanks go to Susan Hockey and Vanda Broughton from the School of Library,\nArchive and Information Studies at UCL, who facilitated this study.\nReferences\nArmitage, S. & O\u2019Leary, R.
