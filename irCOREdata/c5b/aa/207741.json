Introduction \nThe UK Higher Education (HE) System has expanded massively in recent decades, with \nstudent numbers rising from 400,000 in the 1960s to 2,000,000 at the turn of the new \ncentury (Greenaway and Haynes, 2003). One in three now participate in higher education \nas compared to one in sixteen at the start of the 1960s. Many commentators believe this \nexpansion to be a good thing since increased HE raises skill levels thereby contributing \npositively to national productivity. Moreover, it is sometimes argued that increased \neducational opportunities are associated with greater equality of opportunity as more \nuniversity places offer greater potential for the advancement of students from poorer \nbackgrounds.   \n In this paper we study the distributional consequences of HE expansion. We ask \nwhether one does indeed see the expansion providing more opportunities for low income \nchildren to get into HE or whether it acted to reinforce already existent inequalities in \naccess to higher education. We report strong evidence in the direction of the latter.  That \nis to say, the HE expansion has not been equally distributed across people from richer and \npoorer backgrounds. Rather, it has disproportionately benefited children from relatively \nrich families.  Despite the fact that many more children from richer backgrounds \nparticipated in HE before the recent expansion of the system, the expansion has actually \nacted to significantly widen participation gaps between rich and poor children. \n These findings have implications for the Government\u2019s continuing policy of \nincreasing the number of students in higher education to 50 percent by 2010. Recently \ndiscussion about the distribution of HE expansion has moved forward in the public \ndebate. Indeed, the current Secretary of State for Education, Charles Clarke, stated on \n 2 \nBBC news that if he had to choose between fulfilling the 50 percent target for \nparticipation and getting \u201ca much better class basis\u201d amongst those currently enrolling, \u201cI \nwould choose the latter\u201d (BBC News, 18 December 2002).  Moreover, the previous \nMinister, Estelle Morris, recognized the importance of this, saying the following in \nOctober 2001: \nOur pledge to increase participation is one of this Government\u2019s highest \npriorities\u2026.Universities are not a birthright of the middle classes. None of us can \ndefend the position where five times as many young people from professional \nbackgrounds enter higher education compared with those from unskilled and \nmanual backgrounds - 73-74% compared with 13-14% - and when that gap has \nnot narrowed in recent time. (Department for Education and Skills, 2001) \n \nIt is therefore crucial to understand as much as possible about increased inequality \nin higher education participation. It is also important to check the robustness of our \nfindings to different measures and specifications. In this paper we concentrate on a \nnumber of aspects of the inequality of educational expansion using three data sources: the \nNational Child Development Study; the British Cohort Study; and the British Household \nPanel Survey.  These enable us to present evidence on young people who attended \nuniversity in the late 1970s, the late 1980s\/early 1990s and the mid-to-late 1990s.  \nWe first outline results demonstrating that family income displays a closer \nassociation with degree attainment in more recent time periods. In doing so, we explore \nissues on how to best specify the HE-income relation, finding that increases in higher \neducation inequality are robust to different ways of using the available income \ninformation. We also report results from non-parametric specifications to enhance our \nunderstanding of how associations between income and the probability of degree \nattainment have changed throughout the income distribution. The next issue we explore is \n 3 \nthe robustness of the findings to a different measure of educational attainment, whether \npeople are in full-time education by age 19. Finally we present results from econometric \nmodels allowing for different income associations at different levels of the education \nsequence and explore how these associations may have altered as HE expansion \noccurred.  \n The structure of the remainder of the paper is therefore as follows. Section 2 \npresents information about the growth in student participation and describes associated \npolicy changes.  In addition, this Section gives details of the relevant existing literature.  \nSection 3 describes the data we use, whilst Section 4 presents our substantive results, \nincluding a number of robustness checks and a discussion of the implications of our main \nfindings. Section 5 ends with conclusions.  \n \n2. Background \n2.1 The Expansion of Higher Education in the UK \nStudent numbers in HE have quadrupled in the UK since the 1960s. Figure 1 shows the \nDepartment for Education and Skills (DfES) higher education age participation index, \nwhich measures the proportion of young people in HE, between 1960 and 2001. It \ncontrasts the pattern of change in this index with the growth in staying on beyond the \ncompulsory school leaving age. The Figure shows sharp increases in both from 1960 \nonwards. The staying on series appears to have been on a fairly steadily increasing path \n(although is subject to cyclical variations) from the start of the series through to the mid-\n1980s.  From the late 1980s there appears to be a step-change as staying on rates rise \nmuch faster, from 51 percent in 1988 to a new plateau of around 70 percent in the late \n1990s and early 2000s. It appears likely that this rise was a consequence of the \n 4 \nintroduction of the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) in 1988 and the \nconsequent improvement in exam results. This issue is considered more fully in Blanden \net al. (2003).  \n The increase in university participation is also very rapid. There was a sharp \nexpansion in the 1960s, where the age participation index doubled from 6 to 14 percent. \nIt then rose marginally from this level through until the late 1980s, after which it grew \neven more rapidly than the 1960s change. By 2001 it had reached 33 percent, rising up \nfrom under 20 percent at the start of the 1990s.  \n The factors that lie behind the growth of higher education participation in the UK \nare complex. A discussion is given in Kogan and Hanney (2000, Chapter 3).  In part, the \nrise in participation was demand-led as students responded to the changes in the economy \nand the shift towards service industry jobs. Widening wage differentials between \ngraduates and non-graduates, especially in the 1980s (Machin 1996, 1999, 2003) likely \nplayed a role here and it seems likely that HE participation may have been linked to \nperceived changes in economic incentives, at least amongst some groups. \nThe speed of growth was substantially accelerated by the policy decisions made \nby successive Conservative administrations. The then Education Secretary, Kenneth \nBaker, established the principle of university financing following the student: \u201cThis \nwould encourage universities to increase their income by attracting more students and \nproviding them with an incentive to expand at lower cost\u201d (Baker 1993: 234). The most \nfundamental change, however, was the end of the binary divide in the early 1990s which \nput the former polytechnics under the same funding arrangements as the universities and \ncreated the flexibility for the sector to respond to rising demand.  \n 5 \nThe cost of the recent rapid growth in participation has in part been met by a \nreduction in the generosity of student support arrangements. A summary of the total \neffects of these changes is given in Figure 2, which is taken from Goodman and Kaplan \n(2003). From 1977 to 1984 UK university students experienced the highest levels of state \nsupport ever. Many students received a means-tested maintenance grant to cover living \ncosts and fees were paid by their local education authority. In addition, students could \nalso make use of the social security system, receiving housing benefit to help with the \ncost of living off campus and unemployment benefit during vacations. Through the 1980s \nthese privileges were eroded. The real value of maintenance grants was slowly reduced \n(as is shown clearly in Figure 2) and in 1987 student eligibility for unemployment and \nhousing benefit was lost.  \nHowever, the most significant changes in higher education support came in 1990, \njust as the rise in participation accelerated. The Conservative Government had to find a \nway of balancing the rising costs of increased student numbers and in 1990 maintenance \ngrants were frozen. These began to be phased out in favour of subsidised loans that would \nbe available to all students. As Callender (2003) points out this shifted the public subsidy \nof student living costs purely from a large subsidy benefiting lower income students to a \nless generous subsidy benefiting all students (the majority of which are from affluent \nfamilies).  \n However, this change failed to stem the increasing cash crisis in the sector and the \n1997 Dearing Report led to further changes. Students were expected to contribute \u00a31000 \na year to help with the cost of their fees, the maximum loan was increased and a new \nincome-contingent loan repayment system was put in place. At the time of writing the \n 6 \nGovernment is once again on the verge of further reforms to student financing with a \nsubstantial rise in fees of up to \u00a33000 proposed. Concerns about the impact of this change \non the participation of students from poorer backgrounds have been countered by the \nGovernment with an Access Regulator and the reintroduction of maintenance grants for \nsome students.  Whilst the intention is laudable, current estimates of a maximum grant of \naround \u00a31000 a year seem modest at best.   \n2.2 Related Literature \nOur focus will be on the changing relationship between income and higher education \nparticipation and attainment in the UK. Once one scrutinizes the literature it becomes \nclear that there is really very little work on the question of temporal change, despite there \nbeing a huge literature on education and income at a point in time. A lot of this cross-\nsectional work concerns itself heavily with modeling and conceptual difficulties in \neducation regressions that include income as an independent variable (for example, \nMayer 1997). We do not consider this here, but instead we just review the limited number \nof pieces of work with more relevance for studying changes over time. \n Kane (1999) has looked at college attendance and family income in the US, taking \ncare to control for different levels of college preparedness as students leave high school. \nHe finds significant effects of income on enrolment, with students in the lowest family \nincome quartile being 12 percentage points less likely to be enrolled in college two years \nafter 12\nth\n grade than those in the top income quartile, even controlling for test scores in \n8\nth\n grade and parental education level. Comparing this group, drawn from the class of \n1992, with a sample from the class of 1982 from the High School and Beyond Survey, \nKane finds that the increase in enrolment for those from high and middle income families \n 7 \nwas not matched by students from further down the income distribution. This is \nconfirmed by descriptive analysis shown in Acemoglu and Pischke (2001), where \nattendance at a four year college rose by 15 percentage points between 1972 and 1992 \namongst individuals in the richest quartile compared with 8 percentage points for the \npoorest quartile. \nThe only UK analysis over time we know of looks at associations between \neducation and parental social class. Glennerster (2001) reports Social Trends data on \nhigher education participation and parental social class for the UK in the 1990s, showing \na sharp relative increase in participation by those from higher social classes. For example, \nbetween 1991\/2 and 1998\/9 the percentage of children from professional parents going on \nto higher education rose from 55 to 72 percent. On the other hand comparable \npercentages for children from unskilled parents went from 6 to 13 percent over the same \ntime period. \n In this paper it is important to note that we are concerned with the interface \nbetween parental income and individual economic and educational outcomes. In a \nrelated, and very sizable, sociology literature on cross-generation correlations between \nindividual and parent outcomes (e.g. Erikson and Goldthorpe, 1992) it is very common to \nconsider links between social class and education (or to consider the persistence of social \nclass across generations). We believe it more important to concentrate on income as this \nmakes the metric much clearer, particularly as over decades the composition of social \nclass groupings has significantly changed with coincident shifts in occupational structure.  \n \n \n 8 \n3. Data Sources \nThe principal data issue that emerges for our study is the requirement to match up data on \nchildren\u2019s education with the income of their parents. There are two main sources that \none can draw upon, household level data that contain information on all household \nmembers and longitudinal data that enables one to match up children with parents over \ndifferent time periods. To study HE the household level surveys are, unfortunately, of \nlittle use as the majority of HE students do not live in the family home. Thus we use only \nlongitudinal data in this paper. \nWe make extensive use of the two main British cohort studies, the National Child \nDevelopment Study (NCDS) and the British Cohort Study (BCS), and create a third \n\u2018cohort\u2019 using the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS).  The NCDS and BCS cohort \nstudies both follow birth populations of a single week (from March 1958 for the NCDS, \nfrom April 1970 for the BCS), obtaining rich information about their lives and \nachievements at several points through childhood and into adulthood. The NCDS has \nsurvey information available at ages 7 (in 1965), 11 (1969), 16 (1974), 23 (1981), 33 \n(1991) and 42 (2000).  The BCS is very similar and has data at cohort ages 5 (in 1975), \n10 (1980), 16 (1986), 26 (1996) and 30 (2000).  Family income information is obtained \nfrom the two samples when the cohort members are 16 and we also use information on \nfamily structure (number of siblings and whether there is a father figure in the household) \nfrom the age 16 sweeps of the data.   \n Whilst the NCDS and BCS are similar in many respects, the education variables \nwe use are obtained in different ways for the two cohorts. The NCDS is better placed \nthan the BCS to provide data on intermediate outcomes. In 1978 all the cohort members\u2019 \n 9 \nprevious educational institutions were contacted to provide information about their exam \nresults. This gives us very good information about A level (or Higher grade for Scotland) \nachievement. The NCDS cohort is also surveyed at age 23 from which we are able to \ndiscover their history of post-school full-time education and whether they have obtained a \ndegree or not. We are interested in degree attainment at this age to enable comparison \nwith data from the British Household Panel Survey. In contrast to the NCDS, the BCS \nhad a rather unsatisfactory postal survey at age 26 and then was fully surveyed at age 30.  \nIt is from the age 30 data that we take the education data.  As well as asking individuals \nabout their current education level and labour market status this survey also obtains a full \nlabour market history since age 16 and records the dates that all qualifications were \nobtained.  This enables us to learn about age left school, A levels obtained and degree \nachievement by age 23. \n The longitudinal cohort data is very useful for considering the transition into \nhigher education. However, the cohorts are regrettably a little out of date, giving us \ninformation only on young people attending university in the early 1980s and early \n1990s. This does not allow us to examine the implications of funding changes over the \n1990s or explore the consequences of rises in exam attainment and staying on that \nfollowed the introduction of the GCSE in 1988.  In fact, it is a great pity that a further \nstudy was not started around 1980. To attempt to fill this gap we supplement the cohorts \nwith information from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS).  \n The BHPS began in 1991 with a sample of 5500 households.  All individuals over \n15 years old were asked to provide extensive information including details of income and \neducation. Individuals were then contacted in subsequent years and followed through the \n 10 \npanel (adding new respondents from the household as they reached 16); we have data so \nfar for eleven waves up to 2002.  The structure of this data is not as good for observing \neducational transitions as the cohorts. To be comparable with the cohort data we wish to \nobserve family income at age 16. However to observe individuals from age 16 to 23, they \nmust be present for 8 years of the panel, which, given the number of waves of data \ncurrently available, limits us to looking at only four waves worth of 16 year-olds.  We \ntherefore try to maximise our sample via a number of methods.  In case of missing \nincome measures at age 16 we also allow family income to be observed at 15 or 17, and \nallow the graduation outcome to be observed at 22 if the individual is not retained \nthrough the sample until 23.\n1\n  One advantage of the BHPS is that the annual data enables \nus to be confident about the intermediate educational outcomes.\n2\n For example, we can \nfind out about the A level (and equivalent) achievement by looking at information from \nthe wave after individuals turn 18. \n4. Results \n4.1 Descriptive Analysis \nTable 1 presents some descriptive analysis of patterns of higher education inequality and \nhow it has altered over time. The Table shows the proportion of young people who \nacquire a degree by age 23 broken down by parental income groups (the top quintile, the \nmiddle 60 percent and the bottom quintile) from the three cohorts, in 1981, 1993 and \n1999 respectively. \n                                                 \n1\n 23 is a better age to observe whether individuals have obtained a degree as many individuals who do not \nbegin their studies at 18 and have taken longer courses will be missed if the data is taken any earlier.   \n2\n Due to its relatively small sample size and the longitudinal matching to income data at earlier ages, the \nrepresentativeness of the BHPS sample is an issue.  We have compared with a sample of 23 year olds from \nthe Labour Force Survey and with the full sample of 23 year olds from the BHPS.  In terms of gender mix \nthe samples are very similar.  In terms of education it seems that the estimation sample has slightly higher \neducation levels than the full population. \n 11 \nThe numbers in the Table very clearly demonstrate wide gaps in degree \nacquisition by income group. In 1981, for example, 20 percent of children from the top \nincome quintile had a degree by age 23, whereas the comparable number was only 6 \npercent in the bottom quintile. One natural metric of gauging the extent of educational \ninequality is the gap between the top and bottom quintiles. In 1981 this was 14 \npercentage points which (as the standard errors in parentheses show) was strongly \nsignificant in statistical terms. Of course, this is not the only measure of educational \ninequality one can use and below we consider a number of others, and also study changes \nthroughout the income distribution. \nThe main focus of this paper is on changes through time and the numbers in Table \n1 show a very sharp increase in higher education inequality between 1981 and 1999. The \ntop-bottom quintile measure of inequality rises considerably through time, from 14 \npercent in 1981, through to 30 percent by 1993 and up to a huge 37 percentage points by \n1999. The magnitude of these changes is large and demonstrates a considerable widening \nof the gap between the university attainment of the richest and poorest in the two decades \nour data spans. The standard errors for these changes show that the rise in educational \ninequality was strongly significant between 1981 and 1993, a little less precisely \ndetermined between 1993 and 1999 (largely due to relatively small sample sizes in the \nBHPS), and strongly significant over the full eighteen years between 1981 to 1999. The \ndescriptive analysis therefore uncovers a very big, statistically significant, change in the \nassociation between income and degree attainment between the early 1980s and late \n1990s.  \n 12 \nThis is the key finding of this paper. In the era of higher education expansion \nchildren from richer families raised their HE participation by more than those from \npoorer families.  Despite the fact that many more children from higher income \nbackgrounds participated in HE before the recent expansion of the system, the expansion \nhas acted to widen participation gaps between rich and poor children. Given the \nsignificance of this finding, and its potential policy relevance, we need to subject it to \nmore rigorous testing and probing. This is what we now turn to. \n4.2 Specification of the Higher Education \u2013 Income Relationship \nWe next move to estimates based upon statistical models that relate degree acquisition to \nparental income.  The starting point is a probit model relating the probability of having a \ndegree by age 23, the 0-1 variable D, for person i in cohort c to their parent\u2019s log income, \nY, and a set of control variables Z:  \nDic  = \u03b1c + \u03b2cf(Yic)+ \u03b3cZic + \u03b5ic \nwhere f(.) denotes the functional form for parental income, which is the independent \nvariable of interest and \u03b5 is an error term.  \n The main modeling issue that arises concerns the specification of f(.). One \npossibility, as in the descriptive analysis of Table 1, is to consider income quintiles.  Thus \nthe estimating equation becomes: \nDic = \u03b11c + \uf0e5\n\uf03d\n5\n2j\njic1jc\nQ\u03b2  + \u03b31cZic + \u03b51ic \nwhere the Qj variables are dummy variables for quantiles of the log income distribution, \nin this case quintile dummies (leaving out the lowest quintile, j = 1, as the reference \ngroup). \n 13 \n Due to the discrete nature of the dependent variable, the marginal impact of Q5, \nthe top quintile dummy, from a probit model is \u03c8c = Pr[Dic=1| Q5ic =1, Q4ic = 0, Q3ic = 0, \nQ2ic = 0] - Pr[Dic=1| Q5ic =0, Q4ic = 0, Q3ic = 0, Q2ic = 0] = \u03a6(\u03b11c + \u03b215c + \u03b31cZic) - \u03a6(\u03b11c + \n\u03b31cZic), where \u03a6(.) is the standard normal cumulative distribution function. Of course, for \na model with no Z controls this will simply be the measure of educational inequality \ndefined as the gap between the top and bottom income quintile that we considered in \nTable 1. In terms of changes over time, say across cohorts c and c\u2019, then a measure of \nchanging educational inequality over time is \uf044\u03c8c\u2019c = \u03c8c\u2019 - \u03c8c (for which we also calculate \nappropriately bootstrapped standard errors). \n Table 2 thus reports estimates of educational inequality, and its changes over \ntime, from statistical probit models where the functional form for f(.) is taken to be the set \nof quintile dummy variables. Panel A of the Table includes no control variables and \ntherefore reproduces the descriptive numbers from Table 1, with \uf044\u03c8c\u2019c rising by a \nstrongly significant .23 between 1981 and 1999. Panel B then includes a basic set of \nfamily characteristics (sex of child, family composition and parental age).  These \nadditions change the magnitude of the estimates very little and serve to slightly enhance, \nthough very moderately, the patterns found in the unconditional models. \n The specification in Panel C of the Table adds test score quintiles for reading and \nmaths at age 11 (NCDS) and age 10 (BCS). Unfortunately this data on test scores is only \navailable for the first two cohorts, but is one of the big advantages of these data sources. \nThis is because the transmission of ability across generations is seen by many as an \nobvious route leading to higher attainment amongst children of better off parents. \nAccording to this line of thinking, the addition of controls for ability should substantially \n 14 \nreduce the remaining educational inequality. This is certainly the case, with the estimate \nof \u03c8c falling from .14 to .06 in the NCDS and from .30 to .18 in the BCS. But it is really \nvery interesting that the fall is of similar magnitude across cohorts.\n3\n   \nTherefore the pattern of rising degree-income relations is not damaged by the \ninclusion of test scores, as the rise in educational inequality \uf044\u03c8c\u2019c is estimated as a \nstrongly significant .12, or 12 percentage points. Thus conditional upon family \ncharacteristics and test scores, the probability of getting a degree at age 23 was 12 \npercentage points higher for young people in 1993 as compared to 1981. It is obviously a \npity that this exercise cannot be repeated for the BHPS, however we can assert that it \nwould take a very large shift in the relationships between degree, ability and family \nincome for the addition of the ability controls to account for the change in the association \nbetween income and degree up to the late 1990s. \n In Table 3 we consider the robustness of these findings to specifying f(.) in \ndifferent ways. We consider three further possibilities: \ni) log income (Y), so the equation becomes: Dic  = \u03b12c + \u03b22cYic+ \u03b32cZic + \u03b52ic; \nii) decile dummies, so the equation becomes: Dic  = \u03b13c + \uf0e5\n\uf03d\n10\n2j\nj ic3jc\nQ\u03b2 + \u03b33cZic + \u03b53ic; \niii) quartile dummies, so the equation becomes: Dic  = \u03b14c + \uf0e5\n\uf03d\n4\n2j\njic4jc\nQ\u03b2 + \u03b34cZic + \u03b54ic. \n                                                 \n3\n Blanden et al (2003) supplement the controls used here for the first two datasets with additional controls \nfor parental education and interest in the child\u2019s education. The purpose of this is to study intergenerational \ntransmissions in more detail and to complement the test scores by providing measures of the child\u2019s home \nenvironment that will be correlated to both educational outcomes and family income, thereby moving the \nassociation between income and attainment closer to what would be observed if all other characteristics of \nthe family were held constant.  The temporal changes in educational inequality are robust to the \nintroduction of these controls.  \n \n 15 \nNotice for the decile and quartile cases, as with the earlier quintile estimates, the omitted \nreference group is the lowest dummy variable (j = 1).  So the comparison of interest will \nconcern measuring educational inequality as top-bottom decile and top-bottom quartile of \nthe income distribution. \n Table 3 shows the results using the same specification as in Panel B of Table 2. \nFor all measures one detects a rise in educational inequality over time. The log(income) \nspecification reveals a rising sensitivity of degree acquisition to log(income) over time \nand the cross-cohort rise is sizable at .14. Regarding the finer gradation of the quantile \ndummies (i.e. using decile dummies), the rise in educational inequality is larger when one \ngoes to a finer gradation. It is smaller, and still statistically significant, for the broader \nquartile definition.  Thus, under different functional form assumptions we show there to \nhave been a sizable, and significant, increase in educational inequality at the HE level \nover time.   \n For all the results reported to date a natural question to ask, which is one very \nfrequently considered in the cross-sectional literature on education-income relations, is \nwhether income coefficients (for whatever functional form) are contaminated by \nmeasurement error.  Our key result is the rising income sensitivity through time and to \nnegate this, then it must be the case that measurement error is greater in the NCDS than it \nis in the later data. In other words, there would need to be a greater attenuation bias in \nNCDS, meaning no rise in the income coefficients across the cohorts. We have carried \nout various calibration exercises to look at this and have concluded that one would need \nan implausibly large additional amount of measurement error in NCDS as compared to \n 16 \nthe other two data sources to offset the rise.\n4\n  As such this gives us considerable \nconfidence that the pattern of temporal changes observed in the relationship between \neducation and income are genuine. \n4.3 Non-Parametric Analysis \nA natural extension of what we have reported to date is to consider non-parametric \nestimates of the association between income and the probability of obtaining a degree. \nThis is estimated using the Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression as described in Blundell \nand Duncan (1998). The relationship of interest is between the probability of obtaining a \ndegree and log family income (dropping subscripts for convenience): \neg(Y)Pr(D) \uf02b\uf03d  \nThe aim of the estimator is to replace g(Y) with a local estimator of the conditional mean. \nThis can be done by a function (Y)g\u02c6h  as follows: \n\uf0e5\n\uf0e5\n\uf03d\n\uf03d\n\uf02d\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\nn\n1i\ni\nn\n1i\nii\nh\nY)\/h)K((Y\nY)\/h)K((YD\n(Y)g\u02c6  \nwhere h is the bandwidth (measuring the size of the interval to be averaged over) and K is \nthe chosen kernel function.\n5\n  \n                                                 \n4\n For example, under  the assumption that the income data in the BHPS and BCS were completely accurate \nthen the measurement error in the NCDS would need to be very high at 38 percent and 36 percent \nrespectively to close the gap to the margins of statistical significance (i.e. a p-value of .05 on the temporal \nchange). This rises to 47 and 55 percent to drive the cross-cohort increase to zero. More detailed \ncalibrations, making various assumptions about differential measurement error across cohorts, are available \nfrom the authors on request. \n5\n Our reported results use the Gaussian kernel \/2)2u(exp21\/K(u) \uf02d\uf03d \uf070 . The precise form of kernel \nshould not matter much in practice as long as it gives high weight to observations close to Y and low \nweight to those far away. One advantage of the Nadaraya-Watson estimator in our case is that no particular \ndistributional assumptions (except for mean of zero) need to be imposed on the errors making the estimator \nappropriate for discrete dependent variables like degree attainment. \n 17 \n Figure 3 shows the kernel regressions across the three cohorts. The first panel \ncompares the NCDS and BCS. The relationship between income and degree attainment is \nclearly steeper for the BCS, with very little increase in the probabilities of gaining a \ndegree between the two cohorts for those with low incomes but a substantial increase at \nhigher income levels.  The second panel shows the overall change between the NCDS in \n1981 and the BHPS in the late 1990s. This panel shows a steeper income gradient at \nlower levels of income in the BHPS than in the NCDS, whilst income mattered more for \ndegree attainment for high levels of income in the NCDS.  We can explain this pattern \nintuitively by saying that, as the vast majority of individuals from well off families now \ngo to university, higher income beyond a certain threshold level now makes less \ndifference than it did in the past. \n4.4 Different HE Outcome Measure \nThe results presented so far show strongly that degree attainment has become more \nclosely linked to family income as participation in higher education has expanded. Table \n4 explores changes in education-income associations for an alternative measure of higher \neducation: being in full time education at age 19. An advantage of using this measure is \nthat it is available for more individuals in the BHPS as they are measured at younger \nages. This enables us to use a larger sample to check on the patterns found so far.  \nTable 4 shows the marginal effect of being in the top income quintile relative to \nthe bottom quintile on the probability of remaining in full-time education at 19, with the \nsame three specifications as were given for degree attainment in Table 2.  The age 19 \nmeasure corresponds to the second year after A levels are usually taken, so for \nindividuals who have taken the academic route this should be synonymous with \n 18 \nuniversity participation, even in a case when they have taken a gap year or retaken some \nexams.  Results for this outcome are similar to those we found for degree attainment, \nalthough the increase in educational inequality is a little muted. For example, in the Panel \nB specification with basic controls, the rise in \u03c8c is .176 (with associated standard error of \n.052) as compared with .221 (.059) for the degree by 23 outcome. The reader may \nwonder about the extent to which this difference is a consequence of the different \nmeasure and how much of this is due to the different sample. For the same samples the \nestimate of the rise in \u03c8c for the full-time education at age 19 variable (again for the Panel \nB specification) is estimated to be .202 (.062).  This slight fall is unsurprising when one \nrealises that the full-time education at 19 variable not only measures higher education \nparticipation, but also full-time participation in lower level courses. It would be ideal if \nwe could check these patterns for the outcome of whether young people are in university \nat age 19, but unfortunately this information is not available for the BCS. \n4.5 Education Sequences \nThe final approach we adopt explicitly acknowledges the sequential nature of education.  \nThis approach has some common ground with the US modelling of education sequences \nin Cameron and Heckman (1998, 2001) who set out to investigate the importance of \ncurrent (short-term) family income on an individual\u2019s decision to pursue two or four year \ncollege because of credit constraints. They set up a sequential model of educational \ndevelopment through adolescence as a series of choices to pursue continued education. \nEach decision is influenced by prior decisions and attainment, so allowing family income \nand background factors to have distinct influences at each stage. Cameron and Heckman \nalso introduce observed prior ability from IQ type test scores as a control for ability. They \n 19 \nconclude that family income is important in terms of attainment by age 17 and the \ndecision whether or not to complete high school, but not on the decision to attend college \nconditional on attainment and high school completion. This confirms the earlier US \nfindings of Mare (1980) who finds that the association between grade transition and \nsocio-economic background declines sharply as individuals move through the education \nsystem. \nTable 5 shows cross-cohort results from models where education is modeled as a \nsequence of outcomes to the next stage by estimating the association between income and \neach outcome just for those who have passed the previous hurdle. We consider three \nsequential (and conditional) education outcomes: staying on after the compulsory school \nleaving age for everyone; achieving two or more A levels (or equivalent qualifications) \nconditional upon staying on; and degree acquisition conditional upon achieving two or \nmore A levels and staying on.   \nThe upper panel of the Table reports log(income) coefficients (and associated \nstandard errors) at these different points of the education sequence. There are several \npoints of interest. First, in the NCDS and BCS cohorts the income associations tend to \nbecome smaller at later stages of the education sequence.  This is in line with the US \nevidence reported in Cameron and Heckman (1998, 2001). However, there remains a \nsignificant income association at degree level, even once one conditions on A level \nachievement.  This says that income matters at HE level even after sorting at A level has \ntaken place.  \nSecond, and probably most important, this declining relationship is not seen in the \nBHPS and one sees numerically larger marginal effects at the A level and degree stage \n 20 \nfor people attending university in the late 1990s.  Again the degree conditional upon A \nlevel income coefficient remains statistically significant.  This reinforces the earlier \nfindings of increased inequality in education arising from the HE expansion from much \nmore stringent econometric models that condition upon earlier educational achievement \n(and therefore net out inequalities at those earlier stages).   \nThe lower panel of the Table reports models from the NCDS and BCS that \nadditionally control for test scores.  The inclusion of these amounts to a very stringent \ntest of the finding that there are income effects at each education level.  Nevertheless the \nresults reported show that at all stages significant income effects at degree level remain \neven when we condition on whether individuals have passed the previous stage and their \nearlier ability.  As such it is reassuring that the significant income association at degree \nlevel remains when one does condition on test scores.  It is unfortunate that we are not \nable to extend this method to the BHPS due to not having test score data. However, it is \nclear that substantial changes must have occurred in the relationships for our findings for \nthe BHPS to be changed substantially when the results for the other two cohorts remain \nsignificant.  \n4.6 Implications \nIncreased inequality in HE participation and attainment has implications for other aspects \nof inequality, both for the generation experiencing the extra inequality and, if education-\nincome relations continue through time, for future generations. On the former it is well \ndocumented that graduates earn more than non-graduates and that this wage differential \nhas widened in the recent past, especially in the 1980s (Machin, 1996, 1999, 2003). The \nexperience of the 1980s and 1990s pointed to an important increase in employer demand \n 21 \nfor graduates, even though there were more of them, and this tended to raise wage \ninequality (Schmitt, 1995; Machin and Van Reenen, 1998). This generates a concern that \nwage returns to university qualifications becoming more concentrated amongst people \nfrom richer families can act to bolster and reinforce inequality. \n This means that the strengthening of education-income relations through time has \nimportant implications for intergenerational inequality. Solon (2003) demonstrates that an \nincreased relationship between parental income and education will lead to an increase in \nintergenerational immobility. In a simple version of his model there are two generations, t \nand t-1. In generation t labour market earnings W are a function of human capital H so \nthat Wt = \uf066tHt + ut, where ut is a random error term. If children\u2019s human capital \naccumulation then relates to parental income we can write Ht = \uf079tWt-1 + vt  (vt being an \nerror term). One can combine the wage and human capital equations to generate an \nintergenerational mobility function, Wt = \uf062tWt-1 + \uf077t where \uf077t = \uf066tvt + ut and the \nparameter \u03b2t = \uf066t\uf079t. measures the extent of intergenerational mobility, with a higher \u03b2t \ndepicting greater persistence in earnings across generations, or less intergenerational \nmobility. \n The extent of intergenerational immobility, \u03b2t , will be higher if there are higher \nreturns to human capital for children (\uf066t is higher), or if children\u2019s human capital \nbecomes more sensitive to parental earnings (\uf079t is higher).  Evidence in Blanden et al \n(2002) from the NCDS and BCS cohorts shows that the increased link between education \nand family income that occurred across these two birth cohorts did in fact lead to a fall in \nintergenerational mobility. If the intergenerational relation is measured in a given period \nby a statistical regression Wt = \u03b4 + \u03b8Yt-1 + \u03bet where Wt is log(labour market earnings) in \n 22 \ngeneration t, Yt-1 is log(parental income) in generation t-1 and \u03bet is an error term in the \nregression function, the intergenerational mobility parameter \u03b8 for sons from that study is \nestimated to be .095 (standard error = .031) higher for 1970 birth cohort as compared to \nthe 1958 birth cohort.\n6\n For daughter-father comparisons there is a rise of .059 (.031).\n7\n  \n Therefore strengthening HE-income relations have implications for the within and \nbetween generation inequality of economic outcomes. It is, of course, too early to study \nthese relations for our third BHPS cohort, but this will be an important future research \nquestion. \n \n5. Conclusions \nIn the UK the higher education sector massively expanded in terms of student numbers in \nthe last quarter of a century. In this paper we explore the distributional consequences of \nthis expansion focusing on how educational inequality \u2013 defined as higher education \nparticipation and attainment across different family income groups \u2013 has moved through \ntime.  The results are clear and show that, over this period, HE expansion has not been \nequally distributed across people from richer and poorer backgrounds. Rather, it has \ndisproportionately benefited children from relatively rich families.  Despite the fact that \nmany more children from higher income backgrounds participated in HE before the \nrecent expansion of the system, the expansion acted to widen participation gaps between \nrich and poor children. \nThis finding emerges from the analysis of longitudinal data from three time \nperiods that enables us to study temporal shifts in HE by parental income for children \n                                                 \n6\n The NCDS estimate is .166 (.020) and this rises to .260 (.024) for the BCS. \n7\n The cross-cohort rise is from .168 (.022) to .227 (.022). \n 23 \ngoing to university in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. The increase in HE inequality is \nrobust to the consideration of alternative measures of education participation and \ninequality definitions. The same result also emerges from non-parametric estimations and \nfrom a more detailed econometric model allowing for the sequential nature of education \nattainment with potentially different income associations at different stages of the \neducation sequence. \n 24 \nReferences \nAcemoglu, D. and S.
