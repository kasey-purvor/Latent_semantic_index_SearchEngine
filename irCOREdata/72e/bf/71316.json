Using closed-form equations that map the geometry to the wire parasitics and empirical switch factor based delay models that show how repeaters can be optimized to compensate for dynamic effects, we devise a method of analysis for optimizing throughput over a given metal area. This analysis is used to show that there is a clear optimum configuration for the wires which maximizes the total bandwidth. Additionally, closed form equations are derived, the roots of which give close to optimal solutions. It is shown that for wide buses, the optimal wire width and spacing are independent of the total width of the bus, allowing easy optimization of on-chip buses.

INTRODUCTION\nMOORE\u2019S LAW has held remarkably true over the yearsand challenges at the device level have been and are\nbeing met with solutions of great ingenuity. It seems reason-\nable to assume that Moore\u2019s law will continue to hold true over\nthe next eight to ten years. The ability to put hundreds of mil-\nlions of transistors on a single chip has, however, created new\nchallenges for the systems engineer in dealing with the com-\nplexity in such a way that potential bottlenecks such as timing\nclosure, power distribution, and input\u2013output requirements are\nnot allowed to dictate the ultimate size, and hence, the func-\ntionality of the chip. A potential solution is an on-chip packet\nswitched network, which has been proposed by a number of au-\nthors [1]\u2013[3]. Whether of a regular tiled nature or otherwise, the\ninterblock communication link in all of these schemes will con-\nsist of a large number of parallel wires with uniform coupling\nover most of the wire length in all probability.\nThis article examines signaling techniques and conventions\nover such relatively long coupled lossy lines, with emphasis\non minimizing delay and maximizing bandwidth over multinet\nstructures. A key question that we pose and attempt to answer\nin this paper is, given a fixed area in which to distribute the in-\nterconnect, what is the best arrangement of the wires to obtain\nManuscript received February 5, 2002; revised June 19, 2002.

Is it to have a few fat wires and a high\nsignaling frequency, or a large number of small wires with a\nlower signaling frequency, or anything in between? How does\nthe wire spacing affect overall bandwidth? What effect does re-\npeater insertion have? How many repeaters should there be and\nhow should they be sized?\nInterconnects in deep submicron technologies are typically\nvery lossy so that the delay dominates. In order to keep the\nresistance to a minimum, the aspect ratio (height\/width) of wires\nis increased, which gives rise to increased interwire capacitance.\nThis interwire capacitance results in crosstalk which has an ef-\nfect on the delay, depending on how the aggressor lines switch.\nCrosstalk is of special significance in uniformly coupled par-\nallel wires, causing unpredictable delays. A crucial point here\nis that when the geometry of the wire arrangement changes,\nthe parasitics of the wires change in a highly nonlinear fashion.\nIn particular, the exact manner in which the total capacitance\nis distributed into a ground component, and a component con-\nsisting of the capacitance to the adjacent wires is important, as\nthis dictates the charging\/discharging time. In the following sec-\ntions, we carry out a novel analysis for optimizing bandwidth\nwhich maps the wire geometry to the parasitics, and uses modi-\nfied switch factor based delay models that consider the effect of\ncrosstalk on delay with good accuracy. Equations for optimizing\nthe repeater size and number to compensate for the effects of\nswitching aggressors are developed to aid in this analysis. We\nshow that for a given metal resource in terms of a fixed total\nwidth, there is a clear global optimum consisting of a particular\nnumber of wires having a particular wire width and spacing.\nThis optimum configuration does not necessarily translate to the\nmaximum parallelism allowed by the technology, and in fact de-\nviates considerably from it when the resources available for re-\npeater insertion are limited. For wide buses, this optimal wire\nwidth and spacing is mostly independent of the total area.\nThe main contribution of this paper is in providing an anal-\nysis of delay and bandwidth issues over multiple, long, capac-\nitively coupled lossy nets, and deriving analytic guidelines for\noptimizing the wire width and pitch for maximizing total band-\nwidth.\nII. OVERVIEW\nAn accurate analysis of interconnects requires solving\nMaxwell\u2019s equations in three-dimensions (3-D), which is\nprohibitively expensive in terms of computation time. However,\nit is possible to use simplified models in most cases to capture\nthe important effects in the regime of interest [4].

Parasitic Modeling\nThe skin depth at the highest frequency of interest is usually\nhigh enough so that the DC resistance is quite accurate [5]\n(1)\nIf second-order effects are ignored, and the capacitance\nof a wire is modeled solely by its parallel plate capacitance,\nchanging the width does not affect the RC delay, as a decrease\n(increase) in resistance by a certain factor is accompanied by\nan increase (decrease) in capacitance by the reciprocal of the\nsame factor leaving the RC product unchanged, However, it is\nwell known that for interconnects in sub-micron technologies,\nthe higher aspect ratio results in the fringing component of the\ncapacitance being of similar or often greater magnitude than the\nparallel plate component [6]. Hence, the RC delay does change\nwith the wire width, and does so in a highly nonlinear fashion.\nFurther, most of the fringing capacitance is to an adjacent\nconductor, which results in capacitive crosstalk. Hence, the\naccurate distribution of the total capacitance into self and\nmutual terms is very important. The parasitic capacitance is a\nvery strong function of the geometry, and 3-D field solvers are\nrequired to obtain accurate values. However, over the years,\nempirical equations have been developed which have reason-\nable accuracy, and are very important in gaining an intuitive\nunderstanding at a system level. The models can be broadly\nclassified into those that consider an isolated rectangular\nconductor, and those that consider a multiwire structure. The\ngeometrical parameters mentioned below can be identified by\nreferring to Fig. 1.\nThe models in the first category describe the self capacitance\nof the wire and an overview can be found in [7]. One of the early\napproaches detailed in [8] gives an empirical formula which\ndecomposes the capacitance of a single rectangular wire over\na ground plane into a parallel plate component and a compo-\nnent proportional to a circular wire over a ground plane, and\nhence, has a straightforward physical motivation. The accuracy\nof this equation however drops rapidly when the ratio falls\nbelow values of about 2\u20133. The trend in modern technologies\nis to have increasing numbers of metal layers, thus increasing\n, and shrinking wire sizes, decreasing , making the regime\nbelow this ratio the most interesting, and hence, rendering it un-\nsuitable for on-chip wires. In [9], Sakurai reports (2) which was\ndeveloped from curve fitting techniques, and is more accurate\nin the regime of interest\n(2)\nFinally, in [10], another slightly more complex equation is\npresented for the configuration of a single wire, which is re-\nported to be the most accurate in [7] for the values of dielectric\nthickness ( m) and conductor thickness ( m)\nthat were used in the study.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

The total capacitance given by\nthis equation is in very good agreement with that predicted by\na field solver for the total capacitance of the middle wire, but\nthe individual components are not intended to provide decom-\nposition of the total into ground and coupled components. Since\nthe presence of the adjacent conductors significantly affects the\nelectric field around the central conductor, accurate decompo-\nsition requires that the proximity of the neighboring conduc-\ntors, or in a mathematical sense the quantity , has to be mod-\neled in the expression for the self capacitance. It then follows\nthat the expressions for mutual capacitance are also unusable\non their own.1 Hence, although these equations are quite useful\nfor certain applications, they not suitable for a bandwidth anal-\nysis which requires that the distribution of the capacitance into\nself and mutual components be accurate.\nSince then, formulae which attempt to partition the total ca-\npacitance into two components accurately have been proposed,\nin [12] and [13] and more recently in [14] and [15]. The equa-\ntions in [12] have been widely used in the past, but drop in\naccuracy when the aspect ratio of the wires increase to DSM\nproportions. The methodology proposed in [14] uses numerous\ntechnology dependent constants, which render the models rather\ndifficult to use without familiarity with their derivation. The for-\nmulae proposed in [13] and [15] can be conveniently used for\nparasitic extraction of DSM geometries. The models in [15] use\na single technology dependent constant, derived by generating\na database of values with a field solver for different geometries\nin a particular technology, and then using curve fitting tech-\nniques. They are in effect a modification of Sakurai\u2019s equations\nto render the partitioning more accurate. In this paper, these\nlatter models will be used for mapping the wire geometry to the\ncapacitive parasitics. They are reproduced in Section III-A.\nExtraction of inductive parasitics poses problems of a dif-\nferent nature altogether [5], and in fact there is a certain du-\nality when compared with capacitance extraction. Capacitance\nis very localized in that the electric field lines from a given\nconductor tend to terminate on the nearest neighbor conduc-\ntors. This makes the capacitance matrix sparse (since only the\nterms related to the coupling between close wires need be in-\ncluded, the others being insignificant), so that analytic formulae\nneed only model the geometry of the wire in question and the\nadjacent wires. However, the nonzero interaction terms have a\nvery strong geometry dependence. This makes the accuracy of\nanalytic formulae somewhat limited, and an error contained to\nwithin roughly 10% is about the best that can be hoped for in the\nprediction of different capacitive components of complex struc-\ntures. By contrast, strong geometry dependence does not exist\nfor inductance and local calculation is rather easy, rendering an-\n1An excellent discussion including independent verification of this can be\nfound in [11].\nalytic formulae for partial inductances quite accurate. But again,\ncontrary to the situation with capacitance, the locality problem\nis much harder. Current loops defining flux linkages can, and\noften do, extend far beyond the conductor in question, making\nthe inductance matrix very dense. Hence, sparsifying the induc-\ntance matrix is a difficult problem. Because of the relative insen-\nsitivity of signal waveforms to variations in the parasitic induc-\ntance though, expensive extraction techniques can be avoided\nto a fair extent for most circuits, with some approaches even\nadopting a constant precharacterized inductance [16].\nB. Delay Modeling\n1) Interconnect Modeling: From now on, whenever delay is\nmentioned without further qualification, we are talking about\nthe 50% point of the step response, which is the delay to the\nswitching threshold of an inverter. The most ubiquitous circuit\nmodel in MOS circuits is a lumped capacitance (representing the\nload) driven through a series resistance (representing the driver\nimpedance), which has a single pole response and a delay as\nshown in (4)\n(4)\nOne of the most prevalent methods of estimating the delay of\nmore complex networks is to model the output by a single pole\nresponse, where the pole is the reciprocal of the first moment\nof the impulse response. This is often referred to as the Elmore\ndelay, after the person who first proposed it as an upper bound\nto the delay in an analysis of timing in valve circuits [17]. Now,\nthin on-chip wires have a high resistance and are most often\nmodeled by distributed RC lines. Signal propagation along such\nlines is governed by the diffusion equation which does not lend\nitself readily to closed-form solutions for the delay at a given\nthreshold. However, it turns out that a first-order approxima-\ntion results in very good predictions [18], [19]. One way of ex-\nplaining this is to recognize that a distributed line (which com-\nprises cascaded RC sections in the limit where the number of\nsections tends to infinity) is a degenerate version of an RC tree,\nwith the step response in consequence having a dominant time\nconstant. This time constant can be well approximated by the\nElmore delay, or RC, which leads to (5) as the model for the\ndelay of a distributed RC line [18]\n(5)\nThis is a very good approximation and is reported to be ac-\ncurate to within 4% for a very wide range of R and C. Sakurai\nin [20] reports a heuristic delay formulae based on a single pole\nresponse which predicts values which are very close to the el-\nmore delay.\nA distributed RLC model is the most accurate depiction of a\nwire, but it is not possible to get exact analytic solutions for the\ndelay. Numeric techniques based on convolution methods [21],\n[22] and moment matching techniques [23]\u2013[25] have been pro-\nposed, where it is possible to calculate the delay to arbitrary\naccuracy, depending on the number of matrix manipulations.\nFor timing driven layout optimization, however, simpler models\nare necessary. In [26], Kahng and Muddu present closed form\nequations for the delay of a distributed RLC line by consid-\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Particularly elegant\nin their model is the fact that setting the inductance term to zero\nmakes it consistent with the RC tree delay. Now there are an\nincreasing number of works that address the issue of when the\neffect of inductance is important enough to be modeled in the\ndelay [28]\u2013[32]. These expressions, though formulated in dif-\nferent ways, are for the most part equivalent. Reproduced here\nare the expressions from [29], because they neatly quantify a\nwindow where inductance is important, and have a straightfor-\nward physical motivation\n(6)\nA lossy transmission line has series resistive and inductive\nsegments and parallel capacitive segments (the conductive loss\nto ground can be safely ignored for the vast majority of very\nlarge scale integration (VLSI) circuit applications). The sym-\nbols and in (6) refer to the per-unit length quantities while\nrefers to the length of the wire. Now, in a qualitative\nsense, if the combined capacitive and inductive reactance at the\nhighest frequency of operation (defined by the rise time at the\noutput of the driver) is comparable with the series resistance, in-\nductance cannot be ignored. This condition defines the second\ninequality of (6); if the line is longer, the loss is high enough to\nmask out the inductive effect. However, the line also has to be\nlong enough for the delay at the speed of light in the medium\nto be comparable to the rise time; if not, the gating signal is too\nslow for the reactance to compete with the resistance. This de-\nfines the first inequality. Additionally, this window may never\nexist, if the combination of the rise time and loss is such that\nshort lines have a time of flight delay that is much less than the\nrise time, and long lines have far too much loss for inductance\nto be important. This condition is defined in (7)\n(7)\nThe inequalities (6) and (7) can be used to show that for the\nmajority of nets in VLSI circuits, inductance can be safely ig-\nnored.\nIn closely coupled lines the phenomenon of crosstalk can be\nobserved. Crosstalk may be both inductive and capacitive. In\ncoupled microstrip lines, for example, the mutual capacitance\ncouples the time derivative of voltage while the mutual induc-\ntance couples the spatial derivative of voltage, so that a signal\ntransition on one line may induce traveling waves on another\nline [33], [34]. For DSM circuits, capacitively coupled lossy\nlines are the most relevant when the phenomenon of crosstalk\ncauses signal integrity and delay problems. Crosstalk couples\na noise pulse onto the victim net which can have two effects: it\ncan result in a functional failure by causing the voltage at a node\nto switch above or below a threshold, and it affects the propa-\ngation velocity of signal pulses on the victim line. In this paper,\nwe are only concerned with the influence on delay.\nThe effect of crosstalk on the delay depends on the switching\nof the aggressor lines, and can truly be captured only by dy-\nnamic simulators which takes into account arrival times of dif-\nferent signals and carries out a full transient analysis. It is pos-\nsible, however, to limit the aggressor alignment to a few specific\ncases and develop timing models for static analyses. One such\nwork is [35], where moment-matching techniques are used to\nobtain single pole responses for coupled lines. Most often static\ntiming models, which take crosstalk into account are based on\na switch factor. The capacitance for a line is modeled as the\nsum of two components, one of which represents the capaci-\ntance to ground, while the other represents the capacitance to\nadjacent nets. This second component is multiplied by a factor\nwhich takes the value of 0 and 2 for the best and worst cases, re-\nspectively. Kahng et al. in [36] show that 2 does not necessarily\nconstitute an upper limit on the delay in general, where the in-\nputs are finite ramps, and have different slew rates, and that 3\nis a better factor for worst-case estimations in such situations.\nThere have been works which have derived closed form equa-\ntions for the delay where the capacitance has been distributed\ninto two components. Examples are [37], which uses a lumped\nmodel, and [38], which uses a single section model and de-\nrives two pole delay models for arbitrary ramp inputs. However,\nwhen the wire length increases, the lumped model can result in\nlarge deviations from the actual delay. For example, for an iso-\nlated distributed line of 500 resistance and 100 fF capacitance\nwith a 10 fF gate load driven with a driver having a Thevenin\nresistance of 1 k , the difference between the delay predicted\nby a single section model and a five section model is 41%.\n2) Repeater Insertion: The most common method of\nreducing delay over long interconnects is to insert repeaters\nat appropriate points. Bakoglu and Meindl in [39] presented\nan analysis based on characterizing the repeater with an input\ncapacitance and an output resistance which was one of the\npioneering works in this area. Subsequently, researchers have\nimproved on both the repeater model and the wire-load model.\nWu and Shiau in [40] use a linearized form of the Schich-\nmann\u2013Hodges equations while Adler and Friedman in [41] use\nSakurai\u2019s alpha power model to include the effect of velocity\nsaturation in short channel devices. In [42], Dhar and Franklin\npresent an elegant mathematical treatment of area constrained\noptimization. Ismail and Friedman in [27] use the interconnect\nmodel mentioned above to carry out an analysis for repeater\ninsertion which models inductance for the first time.\nAs we mentioned at the beginning of this section, a clear dis-\ntinction is made between crosstalk noise and crosstalk on delay\neffects. There have been a lot of articles published which pro-\npose efficient methodologies to insert repeaters to combat both\neffects [43], [44]. They basically iteratively check for noise and\ndelay constraint violations, and insert repeaters where neces-\nsary, optimizing the placement in the process. The delay calcu-\nlations in these methodologies are made with the switch factor\nbased models, or higher order numeric models such as AWE de-\nscribed in [24]. There have been relatively few works which ad-\ndress the issue of driver modeling and optimizing the repeater\nsize and number to combat the crosstalk on delay effect. One\nsuch work is [45], where the authors model the driver with a\n\u201ctransient\u201d resistance which is calculated numerically.\n3) Our Approach: Since our objective in this paper is to de-\nvelop closed form equations for bandwidth optimization in par-\nallel wires, we use analytic delay models that are very simple,\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

The lines\nare modeled as coupled uniformly distributed RC lines, and a\nslightly modified switch factor based analysis of delay in long\nuniformly coupled nets is presented, where the capacitance is\ndistributed over two components and two empirical constants\nare used to appropriately modify the dominant time constant.\nThis is shown to be more accurate than using a factor of 2 to\nmodel the worst case, although, the complexity is the same. We\nfurther use this model to show that both the number and size\nof repeaters can be optimized to compensate for dynamic ef-\nfects. The Ismail metrics given above are utilized to verify the\nboundary conditions where these models are valid. These equa-\ntions for repeater insertion give a very simple means of mod-\neling the effect of crosstalk on delay and provide an insight at\nthe system level into timing issues in long buses, allowing easy\nanalysis of bandwidth optimization.\nIII. INTERCONNECT MODELING AND DELAY ANALYSIS\nThe electrical model for investigating delay is shown in\nFig. 1(b). Each line, except the two peripheral lines, are coupled\non both sides to aggressors. The reason is that this is closest to\nthe actual situation for an interconnect in a bus. This is a lossy\ncapacitive model which does not include inductance, and is\nvalid for the thin wires which are typical of DSM technologies.\nA. Parasitic Modeling\nTo calculate the capacitance terms shown in Fig. 1 we use the\nmodels proposed in [15]. They use a technology dependent con-\nstant which is calculated from a database of values generated\nby a field solver, and are defined in (8)\u2013(13)\n(8)\n(9)\n(10)\n(11)\n(12)\n(13)\nTypical values of range from 1.50 to 1.75, and 1.65 may\nbe used for most DSM technologies. The equations are reported\nto be accurate to over 85% when the following inequalities are\nsatisfied\n(14)\n(15)\n(16)\nTABLE I\nCOEFFICIENTS OF THE HEURISTIC DELAY MODEL FOR DISTRIBUTED LINE\nWITH DIFFERENT SWITCHING PATTERNS\nFor DSM circuits, typical geometries are well within this\nrange. Additionally, the DC resistance is given by\n(17)\nB. Line Delay and Repeater Insertion\nIn the delay analysis, the victim line is assumed to switch\nfrom zero to one, without loss of generality. When a line\nswitches up(down) from zero(one) it is assumed to have been\nzero(one) for a long time. For simultaneously switching lines\nin the configuration of Fig. 1, six distinct switching patterns\ncan be identified.\n1) Both aggressors switch from one to zero.\n2) One switches from one to zero, the other is quiet.\n3) Both are quiet.\n4) One switches from one to zero, the other switches from\nzero to one.\n5) One switches from zero to one, the other is quiet.\n6) Both switch from zero to one.\nConsider 3) above as the reference delay, where the driver\nof the victim line charges the entire capacitance. Cases 1) and\n2) slow down the victim line, 4) is equivalent to 3), and 5) and\n6) speed up the victim. In all cases except 5), the response of\nthe distributed line for step inputs has a dominant pole nature.2\nSince the time constants in question are linear combinations of\nand , changing coefficients are sufficient to distinguish\nbetween the different cases. The delay is as given in (18) where\ntake the values in Table I\n(18)\nThese constants were obtained by running sweeps with the\ncircuit analyzer SPECTRE. Now the total delay of the line is\naffected by the driver strength, and the load at the end of the\nline. The simplest characterization of the driver is to consider it\nas a voltage source in series with an output resistance , with\na capacitive load of at the input. The linear approximation\n2The reason is that distributed, uniformly coupled RC nets resemble charge\nsharing networks, which often have a dominant pole on the signal path.

Model Verification\n1) Aggressor Alignment: The effect of aggressor alignment\n(the times at which the aggressors switch relative to the victim\nnet) on delay is a much researched topic [48]. For a three net\narrangement such as was considered in this paper, it has been\nshown that when the slew rates are unequal, the worst-case delay\nis caused by aggressors which switch at different times [36].\nSince our models are built up by considering simultaneously\nswitching nets, and we present case 1) as being very near worst-\ncase, it is interesting to check the inaccuracy introduced by our\nassumptions.\nSince we are analyzing uniformly coupled data lines, it is rea-\nsonable to make the simplifying assumption that the rise times\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Eye diagram at the output of the victim net showing the effect of\naggressor alignment on delay.\nof the input signals are the same. Even for this simplified case,\nit is not simultaneous switching, but both aggressors switching\nslightly after the victim that causes the worst delay. This is, how-\never, a very small difference and is really negligible. The ef-\nfect of different aggressor alignment on delay can be seen by\ninspection of the eye diagram at the output of the victim net,\nbuilt up over hundreds of cycles, with different pseudo-random\nbit streams (PRBS) being fed to the three lines. Consider a net\nwith , fF, and fF, where\nand fF.4 The worst case delay pre-\ndicted by (6) is 277.5 ps. Now shown in Fig. 6, is the eye dia-\ngram built up with 1000 bits of 1ns period having 100 ps rise\nand fall times where PRBSs with different seeds have been fed\nto the three lines. The worst-case delay is indicated by the inter-\nsection of the markers, and is 274.9 ps, which is very close to\nthat predicted by the model. The exact error depends very much\non the rise times used. Obviously, the smaller the rise time, the\nmore accurate is the model.\n2) Testing With Real Repeaters: We investigated the accu-\nracy of our models with an actual 0.35 m technology. The input\ncapacitance of a minimum sized inverter in that technology is\napproximately 9.5 fF, while its output impedance is 7.7 k . We\nused signal rise and fall times of 100 ps. In the same technology,\na 1 cm long wire in metal 3 has a total capacitance to substrate\nof 720 fF, a coupling capacitance of 850 fF to an adjacent wire\nwith minimum spacing, and a resistance of 800 . Hence, the\nloads in Table III are chosen to represent global or semi-global\nlength wires. The repeater insertion strategy we have opted to\nshow here is and , and the accuracy is tested for\ncase a).\nThe drop in accuracy seen here is due more to the effect of\nresistive shielding, i.e., poor driver modeling than a weakness\nin the delay models. The practice of treating the inverter as a\nvoltage source-resistor-capacitor combination where the para-\nsitics scale linearly with size, and all second-order effects are\nignored, though poor, are often the only option available for\ntiming driven layout optimization.\n4These figures are the Thevenin resistance and input capacitance of an appro-\npriately sized MOS driver.\nTABLE III\nCOMPARISON OF MODEL FOR BUFFERED NET WITH WORST-CASE CROSSTALK\nAGAINST ACTUAL DELAY WITH REAL INVERTERS\nAs seen in Table III, the accuracy of the total delay predicted\nby (6) is accurate within 82% and 92%. The fidelity of (7) and\n(8) appear, however, to be much greater. By fidelity we mean\nthe closeness of the solutions predicted by (7) and (8) to the\noptimal solutions. This is evident from Fig. 7, where the results\nof simulations for a range of situated either side of the value\npredicted by (6) are shown. It can also be seen that the delay\ncurves are quite flat, and and can be relaxed with little\nloss in performance.\nIV. OPTIMAL SIGNALING OVER PARALLEL WIRES\nFor the wire arrangement show in Fig. 1, the worst-case delay\nof a line is defined as .5 Since in general it has to be as-\nsumed that the worst case aggressor-victim switching pattern\nwill occur on a given line, any calculation of bandwidth has to\nconsider the worst-case delay as the minimum delay over a line.\nThis minimum delay, as we shall show depends on the resources\navailable for repeater insertion, but it shall always correspond\nto the switching pattern in case 1)6 (this statement needs fur-\nther proof, which we provide in Section IV-A1). Hence, for all\ndelay calculations, (22) with is used. The line delay is\nmatched to the minimum pulse width , by allowing a suffi-\ncient margin of safety. The exact mapping depends on the type\nof line [49], but it is generally accepted that three propagation\ndelays are sufficient to let the signal cross the 90% threshold for\nRC lines [50]. Since we already consider the worst-case delay\nwith good accuracy, a factor of 1.5 is deemed to be sufficient,7\nresulting in (26)\n(26)\n5The delays of the two corner conductors differ as they are coupled to only\none line, and the distribution of the capacitance changes slightly. Considering\nthis difference would be an unnecessary refinement for most applications.\n6This is neglecting the very slight difference introduced by simultaneously\nswitching aggressors.\n7The constant used to match the 50% delay to the pulse width depends on the\napplication and is irrelevant in the context of the methodology. We are using the\nvalue given here merely to be able to talk in terms of numbers.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Since each repeater will\nrefresh the signal and sharpen its rise or decay, the mapping be-\ntween the propagation delay and the pulse width needs to be\ncarried out for each section. Theoretically, it is possible to gain\nan increase in bandwidth by introducing repeaters up to the limit\nwhere the bit width is determined by considerations other than\nthe delay of a single stage, or where the delay of the composite\nnet is greater than its constraint. In practice, one rarely sees re-\npeaters introduced merely for the sake of pipelining, when the\ntotal delay of the net and power consumption increases as a re-\nsult. If pipelining is carried out, it is a simple matter to multiply\n(27) by the appropriate factor.\nThe number of signal wires , that can be fitted into a given\narea depends on whether shielding is carried out or not. In gen-\neral, shielding individual lines is only useful against capacitive\ncrosstalk. The magnetic field will in all probability permeate the\nentire breadth and length of the bus, and can only be contained\nby very fat wires. Hence, for the shielded case it is assumed\nthat the shielding wires are the thinnest permitted by the tech-\nnology, regardless of the size of the signal wires, as this serves\nthe intended purpose while minimizing area for nonsignal wires.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Depending on whether or not the designer\nhas freedom over wire sizing, the analysis is different. These\ntwo cases are covered in Sections IV-A and IV-B.\nA. Fixed Wire Width and Pitch\nWhen the wire width and pitch is fixed, optimizing bandwidth\nreduces to the simple task of designing the repeaters to mini-\nmize delay over each individual line. The issue of optimizing\nthe repeaters for the worst-case is examined in Section IV-A1\nwhile resource constrained repeater insertion is covered in Sec-\ntion IV-A2.\n1) Minimum Delay: Equations (24) and (25) give the K and\nH values for minimizing delay for different switching patterns.\nThe obvious question is, how will a repeater insertion strategy\noptimized for a particular switching pattern work for other pat-\nterns? Given in Fig. 8 are the delays for different patterns, when\nthe repeater insertion strategies are optimized for cases 1\u20136, ex-\ncepting 5. The net considered here has a resistance of 1 k and\ncapacitances of 100 fF to ground and to each of the adjacent\nwires. and are set to 7.7 k and 9.5 fF to match\nthe 0.35 m technology we use for testing.

Shows how the delay varies with H and K for a net havingR = 600 \n,\nC = 550 fF and C = 100 fF. The plane at 1.3 ns describes the delay\nconstraint for that net, while the third surface is an appropriately scaled plot\nof HK. Any of the H, K coordinates corresponding to the points on the curved\nconvex surface below the plane are acceptable to meet the delay constraint, and\nthe particular point among all these points that gives the minimum HK product\nis the most desirable solution.\nfor any one of these patterns is greater than the delay corre-\nsponding to case 1. Hence, when a repeater insertion strategy\nis referred to as optimal, it means that H and K take the values\nand , respectively.\n2) Area and Power Constrained Repeater Insertion: The\narea of a minimum sized inverter can be modeled as the sum of\ntwo components, one of which is dependent on the ratio\nof the transistors, and one which is independent of it. Now since\nthe repeaters are H times a minimum sized inverter and are K\nin number, minimizing the area is equivalent to minimizing the\nproduct HK. The dynamic power consumption of an inverter\nis 0.5 (where refers to frequency), and hence,\nfor a given frequency power consumption is minimized by\nminimizing . Since the output capacitance of an inverter\nis proportional to H, minimizing power consumption is also\nequivalent to minimizing HK.\nThe problem of repeater optimization for uniform, coupled\nnets can take two forms. Either the maximum acceptable delay\nfor the net is specified, and the objective is to minimize area sub-\nject to the constraint , or the maximum acceptable area\nis specified and the objective is to minimize the delay subject to\nthe constraint . Consider Fig. 9 which shows the vari-\nation of delay with H and K where the line parasitics correspond\nto row 1 of Table III. The plane shows a delay constraint of 1.3\nns for that net, and any of the K and H combinations which lie\nbelow this and on the curved surface showing the delay is ac-\nceptable to meet the delay constraint. Also shown is an appro-\npriately scaled plot of HK.\nBecause HK is quasi concave in the quadrant of positive H\nand K, it is not possible to find an analytical solution to the\nfirst optimization problem, which has to be solved numerically.\nHowever, it is possible to analytically solve the second opti-\nmization problem because its objective function as given\nin (6), is concave as seen in the figure. The optimum solution\ncan be found by solving the Karush\u2013Kuhn\u2013Tucker conditions\n[51], [52] given by (30)\u2013(34) where refer to the Lagrangian\nconstants\n(30)\n(31)\n(32)\n(33)\n(34)\nB. Variable Wire Width and Pitch\nIn this section, we consider additionally that the wire size and\nspacing can also change. Typically in a process the wires in a\ncertain layer are limited to tracks determined by the minimum\nfeature size of the technology. Within this frame, the designer\nhas freedom to vary the spacing and the width of the wires. Now\nthe problem definition can be stated as follows: for a constant\nwidth , what are the N (number of conductors), (spacing\nbetween conductors), and (width of an conductor) values that\ngive the optimum bandwidth? The variables are discrete as and\nare dictated by the process as well, and there are geometrical\nlimits which cannot be exceeded. The optimal arrangement de-\npends very much on the resources allocated for repeaters, and\nis investigated by simulations first. Then approximate analytic\nequations are developed that give close to optimal solutions, and\ncan be used as guidelines to quickly obtain the true solution.\n1) Simulations: The simulations are carried out for a future\ntechnology with parameters estimated from guidelines laid out\nin [53]. The minimum feature size is 50 nm, and copper wires\nare assumed with the technology dependent constant being\n1.65, height above substrate being 0.2 m, and wire thickness\nbeing 0.21 m. The minimum wire width and spacing are each\nassumed to be 0.1 m and the output impedance of a minimum\nsized inverter estimated to be 7 k and its input capacitance\n1 fF. In all cases the constraint for the wires is set to a total\nwidth of 15 m. Of the three variables and , only two\nare linearly independent, as the third is defined by (28) or (29)\nfor any values that the other two may take. We choose to vary\nand , and assume that and are variable in multiples of the\nminimum pitch. In the subsequent sections different constraints\non the repeaters are considered.\n2) Ideally Driven Line: Although ideal sources are never\npresent in practice, the wire arrangement for the maximum\nbandwidth is interesting as it serves as a point of comparison for\nlater results. Given in Fig. 10 is the plot of how the bandwidth\nvaries with and . It can be seen that there is a clear optimum\nof 16 conductors which is far from the maximum number of\n150 conductors allowed by the technology constraints.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Variation of bandwidth for unshielded lines with number of conductors (N ), and spacing between conductors (s) over a fixed metal resource with a fixed\nsize and number of buffers for each line.\nas is the case with optimal buffering in general whether the load\nis lumped or distributed, the delay curve is quite flat, and the\nsizes can be reduced with little increase in delay.

If (28) describes\ntheir area constraint on the buffers, the optimum configuration\nis the solution to the constrained optimization problem of max-\nimizing (27) subject to (35)\n(35)\nThis adds a third independent variable to the objective func-\ntion (21), of either K or H since is a constant. It is a simple\nmatter to incorporate all the relevant equations presented here\ninto an iterative algorithm that can be used to obtain a computer\ngenerated solution. As an example, assume that is set to\n500 for the same boundary conditions. It turns out that the op-\ntimal configuration is when , and shown in Fig. 13 is a\nplot of the bandwidth where and H changes according to\n. The optimal wire arrangement turns out to be m,\nm and .\n6) Shielded Lines With Optimal Buffering: In general,\nshielding each signal wire results in a drop in the overall band-\nwidth. The reason is that although shielding reduces the delay\nover each individual line, the reduction in the number of signal\nlines more than negates this effect. Shown in Fig. 14 is a plot\nof the bandwidth where every other wire is a minimum sized\nshielding wire, and the signal wires are buffered optimally. The\ntotal bandwidth of 261.3 Gb\/s is less than in the unshielded\ncase. This reduction is however accompanied with a saving in\nrepeater size, and shielding can be considered as an option to\nreduce area and power consumption for repeaters.\n7) Shielded Lines With Constrained Buffering: This plot\n(Fig. 15) also offers a straight comparison with the unshielded\ncase. There is a drop in the bandwidth as can be seen, from 163\nGb\/s to 160 Gb\/s. With constrained buffering, the repeater area\nand power consumption are the same in the two cases, as the\nmaximum available resources are utilized.\n8) Validity of Analysis: Since inductance is not considered\nin the timing model, the question arises of how close the pre-\ndiction is to the true optimum for real wires which always have\nnonzero inductance. Inductance as mentioned before, depends\non the signal return path, and hence, is relatively insensitive to\nthe wire width. Typical values range from 2\u20134 nH\/cm [16]. If the\nmetrics defined in (6) and (7) are applied with a signal rise time\nof 50 ps and the very conservative inductance value of 5 nH\/cm,\nit can be seen that the inductive effects are not important even\nfor the fattest wires in the plots, which are in an unimportant\nregion, and far away from the optimal point.\n9) Analytic Guidelines: An analysis for the optimum band-\nwidth with the exact capacitance equations proves to be in-\ntractable rather quickly. However, an approximate solution can\nbe derived by recognizing certain characteristics in the fringe ca-\npacitance terms.

In the experiments carried out by\nthe authors, it was evident that inductive effects could be safely\nignored for the wire widths that were close to the optimal point,\nand indeed even for those wires much fatter than the wires in\nthis region.\nV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have discussed signaling issues over lossy\ncapacitive lines that are representative of global and semi-global\nlength interconnect in DSM circuits. The accurate extraction of\ncapacitive parasitics in multinet structures by means of closed\nform equations was examined. Then a modified switch factor\nbased delay model with empirical coefficients was used to de-\nrive equations that describe the manner in which the repeater\nsize and number can be optimized to compensate for the effect\nof switching aggressors in long nets. All equations were checked\nagainst a dynamic circuit simulator Spectre, and the accuracy of\nthe repeater models were checked using real transistor models\nfrom an actual 0.35 m process.\nThese expressions were then used to investigate the optimum\narrangement of wires to yield the maximum throughput for a\ngiven metal resource. For a parallel wire configuration, several\nfactors combine to affect the delay in various ways. Increased\nparallelism is desirable in general, but when the total area that is\nallowed for the wires is constrained, this results in smaller, more\ntightly coupled wires, increasing crosstalk, and causing greater\nline delay. Repeater insertion and especially area constrained\nrepeater insertion further complicates the issue. However, we\nhave demonstrated a method of analysis that takes into account\nall these factors, and shown that there is a clear optimum config-\nuration. Because of the closed form nature of the expressions we\nhave presented, this optimum can be predicted easily by means\nof an iterative algorithm. Additionally, we have used simplified\nversions of the equations to produce a single variabled func-\ntion of interwire spacing , and a companion function for wire\nwidth , the roots of which give a solution that is quite close\nto the true optimum. This approximate solution can be used as\na starting point for simulations with the exact equations to pro-\nvide the correct solution with one or two iterations. It was also\nshown that for wide buses, the optimal wire width and spacing\ndepends on the repeater constraints and length, but is indepen-\ndent of the total width. The results we have presented in this\narticle can conveniently be used to optimize on-chip buses.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D. Sylvester and K.
