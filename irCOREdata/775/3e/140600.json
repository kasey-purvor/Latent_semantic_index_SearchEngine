Wing\nmanufacture occurs in several phases, and this project was concerned with Stage 00 in\nwhich the top and bottom skins of a wing box are stiffened by the assembly of stringers\nto the inside face of large machined panels. The Stage 00 process is largely automated\nand features advanced CNC technology of the type described by Hogan (2005). The\nparticular machine featured in this project is used to locate the parts to be assembled\nand position and drill thousands of holes for each wing panel before riveting or bolting\nthe stringers to the wing skins. Although the assembly process itself is automated, it is\nsupported by several manual processes related to machine setup, operation,\nmaintenance and quality control. The personnel responsible for the manual processes\nare supported by a wide range of documents originating from various functions within\nthe organisation. Traditionally these documents have been supplied to users in paper\nform, although some of them are now available on the organisation\u2019s intranet.\nCompared to paper, electronic documentation offers many advantages which have been\nunderstood since the 1 980s. Ventura (1988) links the problems of paper\ndocumentation to the rapidly increasing complexity of the systems the documents are\nintended to support. Such problems include the sheer volume and weight of paper\nsupport documents, the growing problem of inaccurate, incomplete and outdated\ninformation, the disorienting effect of large amounts of information on paper and a lack\nof access. The latter is related to poor portability and the cost of reproduction which\ncreate a tendency to store documents in large centralised stores and encourages users to\nhold onto uncontrolled copies. These problems tend to cause maintenance technicians\nto rely on wrong information that is poorly presented, leading to ineffective\nmaintenance activities. Although Ventura\u2019s (1988) views are based on a study of\nsupport documents for weapons systems, the problems she describes are similar in\nnature, if not in scale, to those experienced by users and maintainers of complex\nmanufacturing technology. She argues that electronic documentation\n3provides a solution, and this paper describes a pilot study to evaluate a particularly\ncost-effective type of electronic document - called an interactive electronic technical\nmanual (IETM) - in a factory environment. Studies of the use of IETMs in the US\nmilitary have shown significant benefits such as 50% reductions in mean time to repair\nand 40% increase in maintenance accuracy (replacing the correct components during\nfault diagnosis), while other benefits include the familiar paperless documentation\nbenefits of reduced weight of documentation and reduced distribution costs (Litman,\n1996). There have been few applications of IETMs in the factory, but Setchi and White\n(2003) describe a similar system that they call a hypermedia maintenance manual\n(HMM). This was designed to support the maintenance of advanced winding\nmachinery. Managers in the factory who evaluated this system believed it would\ndecrease fault isolation time, increase the effectiveness of inexperienced staff and\nimprove safety. Greenough et al. (2001) have also shown how a hypermedia\nmaintenance information system can be used to reduce troubleshooting time on an\nautomated assembly machine.\nConfiguration management and IT\nAs an airframe manufacturer, the case study company has strictly audited processes for\nconfiguration management (CM) to ensure compliance with internationally agreed\naerospace standards such as AS9 100. CM ensures that documents in use are current\nand that those documents which have been superseded are removed from the factory\nfloor. Although this activity represents an expensive administrative overhead, it is\nessential. Aircraft manufacturers can expect to be audited by the FAA or EASA to\nensure compliance, and there are severe financial penalties for non-compliance; as\nBoeing found in 2004 when it was fined $824,000 by the FAA (Seattle Post-\nIntelligencer, 2004). One solution to the high cost of CM is to use specialist software in\nthe form of a manufacturing execution system such as HMS-CAPP\n(www.hmssoftware.com) or Solumina (www.ibaset.com). The latter is claimed to have\nincreased productivity and throughput on the Lockheed C- 17 programme and is\nexpected to save the programme $ 100M in cost avoidance (iBASEt, 2005). Despite\nthese claims, a study of CM within European aerospace manufacturers found that the\nmajority of current information systems did not adequately cover the requirements for\nCM, and that for this reason a combination of paper and IT was necessary. This study\n4found that companies seemed to regard CM as a compliance issue rather than a\nbusiness one (Burgess et al. 2005). This finding is echoed in the opinion of a senior\nquality manager at the case study company who expressed a desire for the company\u2019s\ndocumentation system to go beyond quality management and be integrated more\nclosely into its business systems.\nElectronic documentation is therefore claimed to improve maintenance and support\noperations as well as reducing the cost of CM. Despite these claimed benefits, any\ninvestment in electronic documentation technology is unlikely to be cost effective if\nusers are not satisfied. The aim of this research, therefore, was to evaluate the\nusability and the likely impact on quality and training of a bespoke electronic\ndocumentation system to support an aerospace assembly process.\nResearch Design\nThe approach taken was to create a pilot information system comprising a suitable\npresentation device and the content to be presented. An evaluation of the pilot system\nwould be used to indicate the likely benefits of any similar full-scale information\nsystem. Development of the pilot system took place with the full involvement of all\nstakeholders, including future users, to improve the likelihood that the any future\nsystem would fulfil their requirements. The pilot system was deployed on the shop\nfloor for three months while usage was monitored and a formal set of evaluation trials\nwas carried out. The design of these trials was based on existing theories of\ninformation system usability, as far as these could be applied to the industrial context\nof the application.\nKiosk presentation device\nAs remarked by Setchi and White (2003), web technologies have been shown to be\neffective means of deploying technical information. Due to the ubiquity and\nconsequent low cost of web technologies, and it was decided early in the project to use\na web browser to access electronic content. Two consequences of this decision were\nthe need to convert some existing electronic content (such as spreadsheets) to a more\nsuitable format and the possibility of using an Internet kiosk as the hardware for\npresentation. Internet kiosks have become commonplace in public spaces such as\nbanks, hospitals and airports but they are still very unusual in factories. The two big\n5advantages of kiosks over a conventional desktop PC and web browser are security and\nusability. Environment and purpose dictate which components are used and the\nspecification of those components. The kiosk used in this research, which is shown in\nFigure 1, comprised a conventional desktop PC within a rugged lockable steel cabinet\nequipped with a touch monitor. The keyboard and mouse remained connected but\nlocked in the cabinet, for administrator use only. Users interacted with the information\ncontent via the touch monitor, accessing web pages via specialist kiosk software called\na Public Browser Interface (PBI). The PBI used in this research was SiteKiosk by\nProvisio, which also requires Microsoft\u2122 Internet Explorer and Windows XP to allow\nusers to interact with web pages. PBI software has many functions that are not present\nin desktop computers, in order to provide the additional security and usability that are\nessential for 24\/7 operation in public spaces, where technicians may not be on-hand for\nsystem support.\nUsability features\nSiteKiosk contains many features to enhance usability, including:\n\uf0b7 Object oriented design tools that allow developers to customise the user\ninterface via \u2018skins\u2019 to suit different types of user. The user interface is shown in\nFigure 2.\n\uf0b7 A customisable icon to show users that the device is busy\/working.\n\uf0b7 A configurable \u2018attract mode\u2019 to display images when the kiosk is not being\nused, such as a sequence of web pages or video clips.\n\uf0b7 Banner areas for static or cycled graphics.\n\uf0b7 Support for touch monitors if required, instead of mouse and keyboard.\n\uf0b7 An optional pop-up visual keyboard for touch text entry.\nSecurity features\nSiteKiosk contains many features to enhance security, including:\n\uf0b7 An application called \u2018System Security Manager\u2019 to create a secure operating\nenvironment via a locked down user account. The range of functions available to\nusers can be configured.\n\uf0b7 Blocking of certain key-stroke combinations such as ctrl-alt-delete. This is\nparticularly useful if a hardware keyboard is used.\n6\uf0b7 Logging of all events (pages browsed, actions done, applications run etc.) as\nthey happen, in the client.\n\uf0b7 Control of browser pop-up windows. These can compromise security and\nreduce ease of use, so they can be recognised and closed safely.\n\uf0b7 A software watchdog that restarts the PC following a crash or system freeze.\n\uf0b7 Compatibility with hardware watchdog cards for the PC that allow automatic\nrecovery from serious system errors such as \u2018blue screen\u2019 crashes.\n\uf0b7 Protocol and file type blocking that can prevent invasive protocols and files\nfrom being downloaded onto the system.\n\uf0b7 URL filtering that allows the system to control pages that a user can access\nand what can be printed.\n\uf0b7 Prevention of users from accessing system files through \u2018back door\u2019 prompts\nfrom the Internet, or from running malicious applications.\n\uf0b7 Remote monitoring of kiosk usage and remote support over the Internet.\nFigure 1: Internet kiosk and pilot information system\n7Figure 2: User interface of kiosk-based information system\nKiosk information content\nThe information accessible via the kiosk was divided into two sections, core and\nexternal. Core information concerned the function of the kiosk as an interactive\nelectronic technical manual, and this section contained information about operation\nand maintenance of the automated assembly machine. The core section is structured\ninto five sub-sections accessed by five menus. These are Operations, Maintenance,\nTooling & Spares, Documentation, and Reference. The external section contained\ninformation that is not directly relevant to the technical manual, for example\ninformation on people, the local organisation and the company in general. The\nexternal section is also structured into five sub-sections, which are Organisation,\nTraining, Administration, Contacts and a link to the intranet. Each sub-section\ncontains further levels of information accessible via menu trees. Both core and\nexternal sections contained content that was stored locally on the kiosk client as well as\nproviding access to information stored on the corporate intranet.\nCore in formation\nThe first menu in the core section is the operations menu that contains procedural\ninformation in hypermedia form. This information describes the machine alignment\n8procedures, changeover guides, machine recovery procedures, test piece failure\nprocedures and procedures for defective or missing tooling.\nThe machine alignment procedures were extracted from the existing operator manual,\nwhich is in PDF format, and recompiled into HTML with hyperlinks to relevant\nobjects, such as pictures. The main features of the machine alignment procedures are\nthe step-by-step instructions on how to re-align the machine following a collision.\nUnlike the PDF version of the manual each step is accompanied by a video clip\ndescribing how that step should be carried out.\nThe tool changeover guide was specially created to support one of the most important of\nmanual tasks on this automated machine and this guide is described in a separate\nsection below.\nMachine recovery procedures were extracted from the existing maintenance manual,\nwhich is in PDF format and recompiled into HTML tables using active server pages.\nMachine error messages are displayed along with possible causes for that error and its\nsolution. To use a machine recovery procedure in response to a control error, a user\nenters the error code displayed at the machine controller and the kiosk retrieves the\nappropriate recovery procedure from a database. The full solution is given when a user\nselects a \u2018View\u2019 button. Although most of the information is taken from the\nmaintenance manual, it is presented in a more usable form and enhanced by the use of\nvideo clips.\nThe test piece failure procedure is a flowchart-based set of instructions. Each of these\nflowcharts is linked to information on failure modes, causes of failure and corrective\nactions necessary. There are three different flowcharts for bolts, rivets and cold work.\nThe second menu in the core section is the maintenance menu that contains sets of\ndocuments in PDF form that have been extracted from the supplier\u2019s maintenance\nmanuals. Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) documents are also available here. The\nthird menu in the core section is the tooling and spares menu that allows users to\nretrieve information from a tooling database via a search facility. This database\ncontains data from the machine supplier, for example machine perishables, machine\nnon-perishables and machine fixture spares. In addition, the organisation\u2019s own cutting\ntool database is also accessible from this section. Users can search the database using\nvarious parameters such as tool number, assembly number or drill number and the\nsearch result is presented along with the details of the tools.\n9The fourth and fifth menus allow access to a wide range of procedures documents\nsuch as engineering drawings, manufacturing instructions, working instructions,\nmachine voltage tables, PLC ladder logic diagrams, tooling maps etc. Many of these\ndocuments are retrieved from the intranet.\nTool changeover guide\nThe automated riveting machine is very complex and it requires significant manual\nintervention for tool changing in between runs of dissimilar fasteners. After each tool\nchange the machine must be checked to ensure it remains in calibration, and test\ncoupons must be produced to ensure the process remains capable before the next\nfastening run is allowed to proceed. The machine is used with a range of fasteners of\ndifferent types and sizes, in a range of different processes. To ensure that operators set up\nthe machine correctly for each combination of process, fastener and wing panel, they\nare required to follow a log sheet that describes the task and gives information\nconcerning the tooling and test coupon required. Operators must also enter related\ninformation into the machine controller, as described in the documentation. To carry\nout a tool change, operators must identify the tooling numbers, the fastener size and\ntype and the numbers of relevant CNC programs. This information is held in 57 pages of\npaper documentation of which the format and information structure is inconsistent,\nambiguous and difficult to understand. The use of such paper documents makes it\nexpensive for the organisation to maintain the quality of the riveting process, the\nchangeovers take longer than they need to and some documents are not fully used by all\noperators. Although the automated process is under CNC control, the manual\ninterventions are controlled by paperwork, which the hypermedia tool changeover\nguide was designed to replace.\nAs well as consolidating existing information in a more usable form, the changeover\nguide was intended to be a training application for inexperienced operators, since\nexperienced operators were being transferred to a new manufacturing facility.\nHypermedia technology is very commonly used for computer-based training (Setchi\nand White, 2003) and in this context, the media chosen were movies, full colour still\nimages, engineering drawings (in PDF format) as well as text.\nA formal method known as hierarchical task analysis (Kirwan and Ainsworth, 1992)\nwas used to structure the information in a suitable manner to support changeover\n10\noperations. Hierarchical task analysis (HTA) allows the analyst to identify when\noperators must do things, how quickly they should do them and what kind of\ndifficulties they may have. Despite the differences between operations for different\ntypes of fastener, it was possible to standardise the operations to a large extent and to\npresent a consistent order of operations to the user. By working with the operators, it\nwas possible to agree the \u2018one best way\u2019 of changing tooling and to present this in the\nhypermedia guide.\nThe full set of around thirty changeover tasks was drawn up and these were grouped\ninto six main headings which are consistent for each fastener:\n1. Jog machine\n2. Tool change\n3. Calibration\n4. Test piece production\n5. Test piece check\n6. Panel production\nThe layout of the main page of the changeover guide was decided in discussion with\nusers and as part of the HTA process. A consistent information layout was chosen for\neach task, although this meant that some content was not applicable for certain tasks.\nThe standard screen layout is shown in Figure 3.\nFigure 3: Screen layout for hypermedia changeover guide\nBy selecting any of the main task headings displayed to the left of the screen, the user\nmay select sub-tasks that differ according to the particular fastener being installed.\n11\nThe decision to present a consistent menu structure at task level, with different content\nat sub-task level according to the fastener, means that before viewing the main screen, the\nuser must select the type of fastener for which the machine is being set up. This is done\nvia a set of nested drop down menus with which users select the particular machine,\npanel, type of operation, fastener and fastener size. Having made a selection, the user\nmust validate it before the tooling information screen is presented.\nTheoretical basis for evaluation\nAccording to Bawden (1990), the evaluation of an information system can be carried\nout at any one of six levels. In order of increasing complexity, these are:\n1. Cost - a measure in financial terms of the resources expended on a service.\n2. Effectiveness - a measure of the extent to which users\u2019 needs are satisfied.\n3. Benefit - a measure of the value of the information supplied. This is very difficult\nto quantify so most studies use some surrogate measure, such as \u2018perceived user\nsatisfaction\u2019, or some observable aspect of user behaviour.\n4. Cost-effectiveness - a comparison between the cost of a system and some level of\neffectiveness.\n5. Cost-benefit - a comparison between cost and overall benefits.\n6. Cost-performance-benefit - a view of the entire set of interrelationships between\ninformation system cost, performance, and benefits.\nIn this case, although the cost of the pilot system could be measured, at best it would\nonly provide an insight into the typical cost of a full-scale rollout. Nevertheless,\nestimates were made of both the costs and the benefits of the information system, and\nthese are described later. It was also recognised that whatever the benefits of the\ninformation system, they would not actually be realised if users did not choose to use\nthe system. Since the pilot system was a research instrument and not an officially\nsanctioned information system, its level of use could not be assumed to indicate the\nlikely use or effectiveness of a full-scale system. It was therefore necessary to estimate\nthe likely effectiveness of a full-scale information system by using theories that relate\nuser performance to information system features and by carrying out a structured\nsystem evaluation.\n12\nThe Technology-to-Performance Chain (TPC) model of Goodhue and Thompson\n(1995) relates the features of an information system to operational performance. The\nmodel incorporates insights from two complementary streams of research; utilisation\nfocused research and Task-Technology-Fit (TTF) focused research. In the former, user\nattitudes are predictors of utilisation, whereas in the latter TTF is a predictor of\nperformance. TPC theory claims that for an information technology to have a positive\nimpact on individual performance, the technology must be both utilised and be a good fit\nwith the tasks it supports. The questionnaire-based method of Goodhue and Thompson\n(1995) was used to evaluate TTF, whilst methods based on the Technology Acceptance\nModel (TAM) of Davis (1989) were used to evaluate likely utilisation. According to\nTAM, the user\u2019s cognitive response to the features of an information system can be\nrepresented simply by the perceived usefulness (U) of the system and its perceived ease\nof use (EOU). Both can be measured using questionnaires and both affect positively the\nuser\u2019s attitude towards use of the system, and therefore the actual system use.\nTTF can be represented by eight theoretical constructs which can also be measured by\nquestionnaires. These are data quality, locatability of data, authorisation to access data,\ndata compatibility (between systems), training and ease of use, production timeliness,\nsystems reliability and IS relationship with users.\nFor this research, it was decided to design a questionnaire to evaluate perceived\nusefulness, perceived ease of use and the one factor from TTF theory that was\nconsidered key to success of the application, namely data quality. According to\nGoodhue and Thompson (1995), data quality depends on data currency, the right data\nand the right level of detail. Since it was known that some of the data in the pilot\nsystem was uncontrolled, users were asked only whether the data presented were\ncorrect and at the right level of detail. The emphasis on data quality was because the\nmain purpose of the system was to reduce the burden of configuration management,\nwhich would only be possible if the quality of the data was considered good and if the\nsystem was actually used. The secondary aim of the system was to improve training, so\nadditional questions were designed to evaluate the impact of the system on training.\n13\nTask scenarios and questionnaires\nSeven task scenarios were developed based on analyses of users and tasks. Scenarios 1\nto 3 are related to tool changeover, scenario 4 is related to test coupon inspection,\nscenario 5 is a search for tooling information, scenario 6 is a search for M and G codes\nfor the machine and scenario 7 is a search within the documentation related to machine\noperations. Following the completion of each task scenario, a questionnaire with four\nsemantic differential scale questions was used to gauge users\u2019 feelings about their\nexperience of using the information system. In each case, the scale used was from 1 to\n7, where 1 meant difficult, confusing, non-intuitive or frustrating, and 7 meant easy,\nclear, intuitive or satisfying. After completion of the task scenarios, users were given a\nsecond questionnaire to evaluate their perceptions of ease of use, usability, data quality\nand impact on training. Questions were in the form of sets of statements with which\nusers had to record the extent to which they agreed or disagreed. Again, the users\u2019\nresponses were on a scale of 1 to 7 where 1 meant \u2018strongly disagree with the\nstatement\u2019 and 7 meant \u2018strongly agree with the statement\u2019. Questions are based on a\nselection of the initial scale items described by Davis (1989) that were designed to\nmeasure \u2018ease of use\u2019 and \u2018usefulness\u2019 and a selection of items described by Goodhue\nand Thompson (1995) to measure \u2018right data\u2019 and \u2018right level of data\u2019. In both cases\nquestions were selected according to their relevance to the tasks that the information\nsystem was designed to support, with the wording modified slightly to suit. A typical\nmodification was to replace all references to \u2018electronic mail\u2019 with \u2018the program\u2019. The\nthree questions on training were designed by the author to evaluate the information\nsystem as a training aid since this was considered important by the case study\norganisation. The complete usability questionnaire is shown in Table 1. Note that the\npurpose of this questionnaire is to evaluate an information system in a factory\nenvironment using techniques based on those that have been rigorously tested by\ninformation systems researchers. It was not intended to demonstrate the statistical\nreliability and validity of the questions themselves since the sample size would be far\nsmaller than that used by Davis (for example) and test environment was difficult to\ncontrol, due to production pressures. Instead, the questionnaire was intended to indicate\nwhether an IS similar to the pilot system would actually be used, whether it would\nsupport the activities carried out by users and whether it would enhance training.\n14\nIndex Evaluation Statement\nEOU1 I find the program cumbersome to use\nEOU2 Learning to use the program is easy for me\nEOU3 Interacting with the program is frustrating for me\nEOU4 I find it takes a lot of effort to become skilful at using the program\nEOU5 My interaction with the program is clear and understandable\nEOU6 I found it easy to get the program to do what I want it to do\nEOU7 Overall, I find the program easy to use\nU1 The program will make it easier for me to do my job\nU2 Using this program will save me time\nU3 The program enables me to accomplish tasks more quickly\nU4 The program supports critical aspects of my job\nU5 Using the program would improve the quality of the task I do.\nU6 Using the program would enhance my effectiveness on the job\nU7 Overall, I find the program is useful in my job\nDQ1 The data in the program is pretty much what I need to carry out my work.\nDQ2 The program is missing critical data that would be very useful to me in my job.\nDQ3 The program data is at an appropriate level of detail and sufficient for my tasks.\nDQ4 The structured task procedure could prevent human error significantly.\nT1 The program provides useful and sufficient information for new operators to\nperform their tasks.\nT2 The program allows new operators to learn themselves, easily and without any\nadditional training\nT3 The program with pictures & videos provides better communication to achieve\nthe task goal.\nTable 1: Questionnaire used to evaluate pilot information system\n15\nPilot testing the questionnaires\nPilot testing an evaluation questionnaire is important because it can identify problems\nwith both the information system and\/or the experimental method. According to Rubin\n(1994) the pilot test can be used to refine a questionnaire and provide ideas for further\nquestions, an identification of any questions that are superfluous and a sense of how long\nit takes to fill out the questionnaire.\nThe first pilot test was held at Cranfield University, using two students. The results\nwere disappointing, with each evaluation taking about three hours. Both students\ncommented that most of the subjects in the questionnaire were not familiar to them\nand that the task scenarios were too difficult. It was decided not to change the\nevaluation method on the basis of this pilot study because the students did not\nadequately represent the potential end users of the system. However, some system\ndeficiencies were identified and rectified.\nThe second pilot test was held at the factory, involving one participant from the factory\nsupport team and one participant from the manufacturing system engineering function.\nBoth participants have three year\u2019s work experience on the machine and they were\nfamiliar with the contents and operation of the information system. It was felt that the\nfamiliarity of the participants with the system and their stake in its success might affect\nthe results of the test, so the results were used mainly as a reference, as a check of the\nquestionnaire and to estimate the duration of the test. Each test took approximately one\nhour to complete. As a result of this pilot, some of the wording used in the\nquestionnaires was modified. Table 1 shows the final version of the questionnaire.\nResults\nThe trials took place over three days in August 2004 and involved ten users from three\nof the five shifts that worked with the assembly machine. All were either machinists or\nteam leaders and all were potential users of a future information system. The sample size\nwas chosen to be as large as possible given that relatively few employees had used the\nsystem regularly and there was limited time available to demonstrate the system to\nthose who were unfamiliar with it. As such it the results are unlikely to be statistically\nvalid and average scores are considered adequate to judge the information system. A\nlarger sample size and a controlled test environment would\n16\nhave allowed meaningful statistical analysis of the test data but that was not possible\nin the factory. Users\u2019 feelings about the use of the information system following each\ntask scenario are shown in Figure 4.\nFigure 4: Users\u2019 feelings following each task scenario\nFigure 5: Average measures of perceived ease of use\nOverall, I find the program is useful in my job\nUsing the program would enhance my effectiveness on the job\nUsing the program would improve the quality of the task I do.\nThe program supports critical aspects of my job\nThe program enables me to accomplish tasks more quickly\nUsing this program will save me time\nThe program will make it easier for me to do my job\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nFigure 6: Average measures of perceived usefulness\nDifficult \/ Easy\nConfusing \/ Clear Non-\nIntutive \/ Intuitive\nFrustrating \/ Satisfying\nOverall, I find the program easy to use\nI found it easy to get the program to do what I want it to do\nMy interaction with the program is clear and understandable\nI find it takes a lot of effort to become skilful at using the program\nInteracting with the program is frustrating for me\nLearning to use the program is easy for me\nI find the program cumbersome to use\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n17\nFigure 7: Average measures of perceived data quality\nThe program with pictures &\nvideos provides better\ncommunications to achieve the\ntask goal.\nThe program allows the new\noperators to learn themselves\neasily without any additional\ntraining\nThe program provides useful\nand sufficient information for\nnew operators to perform their\ntasks.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nFigure 8: Average measures of perceived impact on training\nThe average perceptions of the ease of use and usefulness of the system are shown in\nFigures 5 and 6 respectively. The average perceptions of the quality of information in\nand its impact upon training are shown in Figure 7 and 8 respectively.\nComments and feedback were collected from users during the usability trials. These\nare felt to be important sources of qualitative information, and a typical selection of\nthese is given below:\n\u201cAfter practice, very beneficial to me. Everything at finger tips\u201d.\n\u201cGood information. When support teams are not available, it is on the system\u201d. \u201cWell\npresented and very informative, after practice it will become second nature\u201d. \u201cIt\nseems a very helpful system; it will help\/benefit new and old operators. Overall, very\nuseful\u201d.\n\u201cOnce I have found my way around it, I feel it will become very useful\u201d.\n\u201cDoing the job faster does not enter into this exercise, doing the job correctly and to\nprocedure is paramount\u201d.\nThe structured task procedure\ncould prevent human error\nsignificantly.\nThe program data is at an\nappropriate level of detail and\nsufficient for my tasks.\nThe program is missing critical\ndata that would be very useful\nto me in my job.\nThe data in the program is\npretty much what I need to carry\nout my work.\n18\n\u201cThe system is useful provided the programs are put on each LVER machine\u201d.\nTypical of the more negative comments are:\n\u201cThe tooling information table could be shaded to make data separate and clear\u201d.\n\u201cCould do with bigger buttons, fat fingers!\u201d\n\u201cThe cleaning sub-task should be in Tool Change task, not in Jog Machine task\u201d. \u201cI\nfound the system quite slow at first but it became easier with more experience\u201d.\nDiscussion\nThe results for both perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness are generally very\nencouraging. According to TAM theory, the results suggest that if a system like the\npilot system were deployed, it would actually be used by factory workers. The two\nlowest scores for perceived usefulness related to quality and task time. These questions\nwere discussed with test subjects in a debriefing that followed the trials. The reasons for\nthe low scores are:\n\uf0b7 Some operators felt that the system could not improve the quality of their\nwork because this depends on the machine. One operator gave this question a\nlow score as he felt that his quality level was already at 100%.\n\uf0b7 Some operators feel that the system cannot enable them to carry out their tasks\nmore quickly because it is only a prototype system in which the information is\nnot certified or controlled.\nThe results for data quality are positive. Users feel that the data provided in the system\nare at the right level of detail and are sufficient for the related tasks. There was a strong\nbelief that the structured task procedure could reduce human error significantly.\nRegarding training, the participants felt that the system was useful and sufficient for\nnew operators to perform their tasks. They also felt that it could reduce the training\nrequirement for them. One comment that explained the low score for question 2 was\n\u201cNew labour would struggle with information, it is easier to be shown than it is to read.\nIt would be useful as a training aid and to jog the memory of new labour\u201d. This\ncomment may also explain why the pilot tests at Cranfield University were\ndisappointing.\n19\nCost benefits\nThe fixed costs of the information system are dominated by the cost of content creation,\nas recognised by Crowder et al. (1999). In this case the fixed cost of the kiosk hardware\nand software (\u00a32613) was dwarfed by the fixed cost of content creation and\nconfiguration, estimated to be up to \u00a362,000. The variable cost of content maintenance\nwas estimated as the cost of maintenance of the content that was created specifically for\nthe kiosk system, excluding that which exists on the intranet. Annual variable costs\nwere estimated to be up to \u00a38,000. Annual benefits are estimated from literature and\nexperience in terms of best case, worst case and expected savings. Benefits might be\nexpected in the following areas:\n\uf0b7 Training time (a reduction of at least 10%)\n\uf0b7 Paper distribution time (a reduction of at least 75%)\n\uf0b7 Printing requirements (a reduction of at least 40% since some printing is\nexpected due to the need for portable information)\n\uf0b7 Information search time (a reduction of at least 50%)\n\uf0b7 Increased quality (a reduction of at least 10% fewer bad setups, etc.)\n\uf0b7 Reduced mean time to repair (a reduction of at least 10%)\n\uf0b7 Reduced setup time (a reduction of at least 5%)\nBased on figures supplied by the airframe manufacturing organisation, total annual\nbenefits are estimated to be at least \u00a3110,000. The majority of these savings were due to\nthe reduction in mean time to repair, which supports the view that maintenance is\nindeed the most suitable application for this type of information system (Greenough et al.\n2001). This gives a worst case return on investment of 11 months. The best case was 2\nmonths. Full details of cost benefits will be reported in a future paper.\nConclusions\nThe development of a web-based information system to support the users of a complex\nautomated machine tool has demonstrated the benefits that such a system can make\npossible. Furthermore, this use of kiosk technology in this research has shown how the\nuse of conventional information technology from the service sector can have benefits in\nmanufacturing. Crucially, this research supports the view that users will accept such\ntechnology and will use it in preference to other sources of information,\n20\nwhich is essential for control of documentation. Although the aim of the developers was\nto ease the burden of configuration management, the main financial benefit of the\nsystem may in fact be the likely reduction in mean time to repair the machine tool in the\ncase of breakdown. It is felt that system success depends on user involvement during\nthe authoring process, a structured design methodology such as hierarchical task\nanalysis (HTA) and the availability of documents in a form suitable for access via a\nbrowser. It is recommended that in future, organisations that wish to make\nmanufacturing process information available electronically do so using web\ntechnologies. This will require the creation of teams of technical writers that combine\nthe traditional skills of manufacturing engineering with those of the web creation and\ncontent management.\nThere are many improvements that could be made to the information system described\nhere. It could be linked more closely to the machine tool so that error messages from\nthe machine controller might automatically trigger the display of a relevant content at\nthe kiosk. The information system might be integrated with devices for mobile data\npresentation and collection, which would be particularly useful on a very large machine\nlike the wing assembly machine used here. The system might also be enhanced with\nsome kind of expert fault diagnosis system, or linked to systems supporting similar\nmachines to allow users to collaborate in troubleshooting. The evaluation methods used\nare felt to be particularly useful for future developers of industrial hypermedia\ninformation systems.\nAcknowledgements.
