INTRODUCTION \nIn 2007 and 2008, the African Union (AU) adopted two protocols that are significant for \neconomic integration in Africa. These are the Protocol on the Relations between the African \nUnion and the Regional Economic Communities [Protocol on Relations]\n1\n and the Protocol on \nthe Statute of the African Court of Justice and Human Rights [Protocol on the African Court \nof Justice].\n2\n The former aims at addressing a difficult problem with Africa\u2019s economic \nintegration, which is, the existence of multiple regional economic integration organisations \nwith overlapping memberships, and no clear principles of co-ordination among them. The \nlatter establishes a court with jurisdiction over issues that potentially encompass those arising \nunder the Treaty establishing the African Economic Community [AEC Treaty].\n3\n The AEC \nTreaty is the foundation of an attempt to create an economic community covering the whole \nof Africa - a continent with 53 sovereign states. If successful, the African Economic \nCommunity will be the largest economic integration organisation (in terms of membership) in \nthe world. \nThe adoption of the Protocol on Relations and the Protocol on the African Court of \nJustice provides an auspicious moment to examine a fundamental question: what is the \nrelationship between the AU, Africa\u2019s regional economic communities (RECs) and the \nAfrican Economic Community (AEC)? This is a complex question, which has so far not \nreceived any systematic examination in the discourse on Africa\u2019s economic integration.4 \nFinding answers to the question and clarifying the relationship are important for the success \nof economic integration in Africa. This paper aims to put up this issue for serious discussion \nand research. \nII. THE AEC AND AFRICA\u2019S RECs \nIn 1994, the AEC Treaty entered into force. The treaty envisages the creation of an African \nEconomic Community over a period of thirty four years using six defined stages of \n                                                     \n\uf02a\n Lecturer in Law, Lancaster University Law School. LL.B., BL (Ghana) LL.M (Cantab) LL.M (Harvard). \n1\n 17 African Journal of International and Comparative Law (2009): 000. When it enters into force, this protocol \nwill replace the Protocol on Relations between the African Economic Community and the Regional Economic \nCommunities, 25 February 1998, reprinted in 10 African Journal of International and Comparative Law Afr. J. \nInt\u2019l & Comp. L. (1998) 157 [Protocol on the Relations between the AEC and RECs]. \n2\n 17 African Journal of International and Comparative Law (2009) 000. When it enters into force, this protocol \nwill replace the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights on the establishment of an \nAfrican Court on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, 9 June 1998 and the Protocol of the Court of Justice of the \nAfrican Union, 11 July 2003, 13 African Journal of International and Comparative Law (2005): 115.  \n3\n See Treaty establishing the African Economic Community, 3 June 1991, 30 International Legal Materials 1241 \n[AEC Treaty]. \n4\n Senghor\u2019s commentary on the processes leading to the formation of the AEC suggests that there were some \ndiscussions on this question. Indeed, he suggests that the relationship between the OAU and the AEC was a \ntheme of special study by experts. Arguably, the existing legal framework does not suggest that the question was \nthoroughly addressed. See J. Senghor, \u2018The Treaty establishing the African Economic Community: An \nIntroductory Essay\u2019, 1 African Yearbook of International Law (1993): 183. \n2 \n \nevolution.\n5\n Rather than start from scratch, the AEC uses existing RECs as the building blocks \nof the African Economic Community.\n6\n In other words, progress by the RECs is progress for \nthe AEC and a step closer to the African Economic Community. In the words of article 88(1) \nof the AEC Treaty, the African Economic Community \u2018shall be established mainly through \nthe co-ordination, harmonization and progressive integration of the activities of [RECs]\u2019.7 \nThe RECs are ultimately to merge or be absorbed\n8\n to form the African Economic \nCommunity. This is a unique and quite complicated approach to economic integration. \nUsually, countries form economic communities \u2013 free trade areas, customs union, economic \nunions, or complete economic integration. Indeed, to date, it appears the only known case of \na successful \u2018merger\u2019 of RECs was the merger of the European Community with the \nEuropean Free Trade Area to form the European Economic Area.\n9\n A more recent attempt is \nthe Union of South American Nations\n10\n which is a free trade zone that unites the Common \nMarket of the Southern Cone and the Andean Community. \nRemarkably, although the REC\u2019s are the building blocks of the African Economic \nCommunity, they are not members of AEC or parties to the AEC Treaty. It is the individual \nAfrican states which are parties to the AEC Treaty and the treaties creating the RECs. Indeed, \nstates are often parties to more than one REC. These raise complex questions. To what extent \nare the RECs bound by decisions of the AEC? Since the RECs, which have their own legal \npersonality, are not parties to the AEC Treaty, what is the legal basis for assuming that they \nwill merge and form the African Economic Community? Indeed, it is difficult to predict \nwhether the RECs would willingly merge with the AEC.  One may also query whether the \nAEC has the will or legitimacy to impose its vision of an African Economic Community on \nthe RECs.\n11\n If they were to merge and form the African Economic Community, what will be \n                                                     \n5\n In a sense, the African Economic Community both is and is to be! Understandably, this may sound confusing \nto a reader. In this note the \u2018AEC\u2019 is used to refer to the current organization irrespective of the stage in its \ndevelopment, and reference to the ultimate stage of the AEC is written in full as \u2018the African Economic \nCommunity\u2019. \n6\n In 2006, the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the African Union suspended, until further notice, \nthe recognition of new RECs with the exception of the following eight: Economic Community of West African \nStates (ECOWAS); Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA); East African Community \n(EAC); Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS); Southern African Development Community \n(SADC); Inter-Governmental Authority for Development (IGAD); Arab Maghreb Union (AMU) and; Economic \nCommunity of Sahelo-Saharian States (CENSAD). See African Union, Decision on the Moratorium on the \nRecognition of Regional Economic Communities, Assembly\/AU\/ Dec.112 (VII), 2006. [RECs Moratorium \nDecision]. \n7\n Article 3 of the Constitutive Act of the African Union, 11 July 2000, 13 African Journal of International and \nComparative Law (2005): 25, also underscores the need to \u2018coordinate and harmonize the policies between \nexisting and future Regional Economic Communities for the gradual attainment of the objectives of the \n[African] Union\u2019. Indeed, this is described as an \u2018objective\u2019 of the Union. It is worth noting that under article \n88(2) of the AEC Treaty, it was the AEC (not the Organization of African Unity [now African Union] that was \nentrusted with the co-ordination, harmonisation and evaluation of the activities of existing and future regional \neconomic communities. \n8\n Protocol on Relations, supra note 1 art. 5(1)(d). \n9\n See K. Riechenberg, \u2018The Merger of Trading Blocks and the Creation of the European Economic Area: Legal \nand Judicial Issues\u2019, 4 Tulane Journal of International and Comparative Law (1995): 63. \n10\n It consists of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, \nUruguay and Venezuela. The treaty establishing the Union was signed on 23 May 2008. \n11\n Equally important will be the AEC\u2019s ability to finance the cost of the merger. \n3 \n \nthe legal status of the REC\u2019s after the merger?12  None of these questions is effectively \naddressed in the Protocol on Relations. \nNor do the founding treaties of the RECs shed any brighter light on these issues. For \nexample, the Treaty establishing the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa\n13\n \nenvisages the conversion of COMESA into an organic entity of the African Economic \nCommunity.\n14\n This appears to suggest that COMESA does not envision the formation of the \nAfrican Economic Community as its demise. However, the treaty provides that the Authority \nof Heads of State and Government may, on the recommendation of the Council of Ministers, \nterminate the operations of the COMESA.\n15\n This suggests that a legal mandate exists for \nbringing COMESA to an end, if that is what will be needed after the formation of the African \nEconomic Community. Neither the Revised Treaty establishing the Economic Community of \nWest African State\n16\n  nor the Treaty establishing the East African Community\n17\n contains any \nprovision directly relevant to their status after the formation of the African Economic \nCommunity.  \nThe RECs\u2019 treaties were drafted after the AEC Treaty. Therefore, one would have \nexpected that they will address the issues of their relations with the AEC and of their status \nafter the formation of the African Economic Community more comprehensively and, \nperhaps, uniformly. As organizations created by treaties, the state parties retain an inherent \nright to terminate the treaty\n18\n if that is what will be needed for them to form the African \nEconomic Community. As the RECs are progressing further on the stages of integration, the \nmerger issue should engage the AEC\u2019s attention.  \nIndeed, I would suggest that negotiating a merger protocol should start now given the \ncomplexity and size of the undertaking. It should address inter alia issues relating to: the \npost-merger legal status of the RECs; their assets and liabilities after the merger; whether the \nmerger is compulsory or voluntary and, if compulsory, how that is going to be enforced; \nwhen the merger is to occur (simultaneously for all the RECs or incrementally after each \nreaches the needed stage of integration); the status of their personnel; and the status of active \n                                                     \n12\n The United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) conceives the future relationship between \nthe AEC and the RECs in this way: After the [RECs] have achieved a customs union and a common market, \nthey will merge to form the African Common Market, and the full-fledged African Economic Community \nintervention will follow. The African Economic Community will take the lead on dealing with member \ncountries, and the functions and structures of the [RECs] will be revised to serve as its implementation arms. \nSee UNECA, Assessing Regional Integration in Africa II: Rationalizing Regional Economic Communities, \n(2004), p. 94.  \n13\n Treaty establishing the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, 5 November 1993, 33 International \nLegal Materials 1067 [COMESA Treaty]. \n14\n Ibid. art. 178(1)(c). \n15\n Ibid. art. 192(1). \n16\n See Revised Treaty establishing the Economic Community of West African States, 24 July, 1993, 35 \nInternational Legal Materials 660, (1996) 8 African Journal of International and Comparative Law 187 \n[ECOWAS Treaty].

Some, like the EAC, are at an \nadvanced stage of development. It is difficult to predict whether they would willingly merge \nwith their less progressive counterparts such as the Inter-Governmental Authority on \nDevelopment. It is also arguable whether a merger of the RECs will be supported by interest \ngroups within the RECs. Public choice theorists characterise international organisations as \nbureaucracies that are more responsive to the demands of organised interest groups, including \ntheir staff.  As Vaubel notes, \u2018like all bureaucracies, international organizations fight for their \nsurvival and for more powers and resources. Thus, it is more difficult to abolish an \ninternational organization than to establish it, or to reduce its powers and resources than to \nincrease them\u2019.19 Indeed, already, an appreciable number of staff cases have appeared before \nthe courts set up by the various RECs, an evidence of people trying to protect their \u2018turf\u2019.20 \nThe number of staff cases, and the tenacity with which they appear to have been pursued, \nlend some credence to Rasul\u2019s thesis that economic integration has become a job generating \nventure for Africa\u2019s educated elite,21 and raise the prospect of obstructionist litigation before \nand during the merger. \nAdditionally, the RECs are legal systems in their own right. Unlike the AEC, they are \nexpressly endowed with separate legal personality.\n22\n Accordingly, even before the merger, \nthere is the need to structure and manage the relations between the AEC and the RECs\u2019 legal \nsystems as well as among the RECs. The Protocol on Relations does not go far in addressing \nthese complicated relational issues   \nEffectively and boldly addressing the problems resulting from multiple memberships and \nthe troubling relational issues between the AEC and the RECs, and among the RECs, will \nrequire legal imagination, economic thought, and strong institutional and political will. There \nis the urgent need for the AEC to actively rationalise the relations among the RECs and \nbetween the RECs and itself.\n23\n This is important for the development of the African \nEconomic Community.

I suggest that another \nimportant step will be for the AEC to adopt a protocol founded on a \u2018one country-one \ncommunity membership\u2019 of the eight AU recognised RECs principle. With the help of \nnational institutions and commissioned experts, countries should be guided to decide based \non predominately economic criteria, which RECs best suits their needs taking into account \nthe fact that the ultimate realization of the vision of an African Economic Community may \nhelp address some of their needs. This should not be viewed as an inappropriate infringement \non state sovereignty, but as a measure needed for effectively pooling state sovereignty for a \ncommon good. \nIndeed, the legal foundation for such as protocol can be sought in article 5(1) of the AEC \nTreaty. In it, member states undertook to \u2018create favourable conditions for the development \nof the Community and the attainment of its objectives, particularly by harmonising their \nstrategies and policies\u2019, and to \u2018refrain from any unilateral action that may hinder the \nattainment of the said objectives\u2019. I argue that the unilateral decision of AEC member states \nto be members of multiple RECs creates unfavourable conditions for the development of the \nAEC.  \nAdmittedly, getting support for and enforcing this protocol will be difficult. It will be the \nultimate test not only of the enforcement powers of the AEC, but also of member states\u2019 \ncommitment to the realisation of its vision beyond their political rhetoric of support. Non-\ncomplying states should be threatened with expulsion and ultimately expelled from the AEC \nand all but one of the RECs to which they are members.\n25\n I dare say that the vision of an \nAfrican Economic Community should not be founded on the ideal of all African countries as \nmembers. The European Community does not consist of all states in Europe. The North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement covers less than all countries on the North American \ncontinent. And the World Trade Organization comprises less than all the countries of the \nworld. There is no legitimate reason why an African Economic Community cannot consist of \nsomething less than all of Africa! For a continent consisting of 53 state, a few of them \ndysfunctional, collapsed or collapsing, and many with different levels of socio-economic, \nlegal and political development, the pursuit of this ideal will delay, indeed, thwart the timely \nrealization of a noble economic vision.  \nWriting in the context of the collapse of the OAU, Professor Kufuor perceptively \nobserved that \u2018unrestricted access in the form of virtually no entry requirements led to the \ntragedy of the regional commons, the degrading of the OAU as an organization of any \nvalue\u2019.26 Won\u2019t the stature, integrity and effectiveness of the OAU\/AU have been enhanced if \nit consisted of say twenty democratic, human rights respecting, socially and economically \ndeveloped states which extend the benefits of the organisation to non-members on defined \nconditions? Like Professor Kufuor, I argued here that Africa\u2019s economic integration is being \ndevalued, delayed and diluted due to the fact that countries are able to sign up at will without \nstrict prior defined and continuous commitments to implementation. An African Economic \nCommunity which consists of a few African states can extend through conditioned \nagreements the benefits of integration to other countries that need not necessary be its \n                                                     \n24\n See RECs Moratorium Decision, supra note 6. \n25\n These countries can still be members AU, the \u2018political\u2019 organization. \n26\n K.

Currently, the AEC Treaty does not have a membership provision or \ncriterion, but it appears to assume all African state as potential members.\n29\n By becoming fully \nsigned up members of the AEC, the RECs will be bound by all AEC laws, including laws \nwhich aim at rationalizing and co-ordinating their activities. They will become subject to \nAEC enforcement processes and active and interested participants in its decision making \nprocess. This will help in the elimination or at least minimise of potential conflict of laws, \npolicies and jurisdiction. \nIII. THE AU AND THE AEC \nAs if the above was not complex enough, another leg must be added to this bizarre web of \nlegal relations on the path to Africa\u2019s economic integration. This is the OAU (now AU) leg. \nAfricans have long aspired to be politically united. The OAU was a first step towards this \ngoal. However, economic integration and political unification are two distinct ideas. These \ntwo ideas should not be convoluted. They need not be pursued together. Indeed, the former is \ndefinitely achievable without the latter. In my opinion, a principal problem with economic \nintegration in Africa is the non-realisation of this truth.\n30\n In Africa, there has been a \nconvolution of these two ideas. This convolution of ideas has led to an inappropriate \nstructuring and fusion of institutions, which ultimately ill-serve the objectives of economic \nintegration.  \nFor the AEC, the problem of mixing the economic with the political began when its \nfounding treaty declared in article 98(1) that \u2018the Community shall form an integral part of \nthe [Organisation of African Unity]\u2019.31 Article 99 went on to declare that the treaty and \nprotocols adopted under it shall form an integral part of the OAU Charter. With these \nprovisions, it appears the drafters thought it unnecessary to expressly give the AEC a separate \nlegal personality; accordingly, the treaty is silent on this issue.\n32\n What was meant by \u2018an \n                                                     \n27\n An example of this may be the relationship between the European Community and Turkey. \n28\n Both instruments are signed by the RECs, but this does not make them members of the AEC. \n29\n Compare article 3 of the EAC Treaty, supra note 17, which sets out matters to be taking into account in \nconsidering a membership application from \u2018a foreign country\u2019. \n30\n It appears reality dawned on Africa leaders when they declared as one of the steps towards the creation of the \nUnion Government of Africa the following: To rationalize and strengthen the [RECs], and harmonize their \nactivities, \u2026 so as to lead to the creation of an African Common Market, through the stages set in the Treaty \nEstablishing the African Economic Community (Abuja Treaty), with a reviewed and shorter timeframe to be \nagreed upon in order to accelerate the economic and, where possible, political integration. See African Union, \nAccra Declaration, 3 July 2007, para. 2(a) [emphasis added]. \n31\n AEC Treaty, supra note 3. \n32\n However, in his capacity as the legal representative of the Community, the Secretary-General is given power \nto, on behalf of the Community, enter into contracts and be a party to judicial and other legal proceedings. See \nAEC Treaty, ibid. art. 98(2). \n7 \n \nintegral part\u2019 was not defined. But the immediate effect of these provisions was that the \ninstitutions or organs of the OAU were co-opted to perform the functions of the institutions \nestablished by the AEC Treaty. There appears to have been no careful thought as to whether, \nas then structured, the OAU institutions suited the needs of economic integration. The \nConstitutive Act of the African Union\n33\n did not address this problem. After passing \nreferences to the African Economic Community in the preamble, it simply provided that the \n\u2018Act shall take precedence over and supersede any inconsistent or contrary provisions of the \n[AEC Treaty]\u2019.  \nHistorically and comparatively, it is worth recalling that the Treaty for East African Co-\noperation\n34\n which established the East African Community had \u2018as an integral part of the \nCommunity\u201935 the East African Common Market. However, unlike the situation with the \nAEC, the Treaty for East African Co-operation established at least two institutions devoted \nspecifically to the common market, namely the Common Market Council and Common \nMarket Tribunal.\n36\n More recently, Professor Asante has decried the use of the organs of the \nOAU (now AU) as the basic organs of the AEC.\n37\n These organs are ill-equipped to meet the \nchallenges of integration. The effect of this fusion of institutions has been the loss of identity \nof the AEC. Indeed, as he graphically puts it, the AEC has no \u2018letterhead of its own\u2019, it \u2018has, \nin fact become just a division, albeit an important one, of a continental political institution\u2019.38 \nIn his view, which I endorse, \u2018the AEC surely requires distinct and separate institutional \narrangements\u2019.39 The African Court of Justice is, perhaps, the best example of the \ninappropriateness of the convolution of institutional roles. \nThe Court of Justice of the AEC\n40\n was to be an important institution for the enforcement \nof AEC law.  It was to be independent of all the other community institutions. Its mandate \nwas to \u2018ensure the adherence to law in the interpretation and application of [the AEC Treaty] \nand shall decide on disputes submitted thereto pursuant to [the AEC Treaty]\u2019.41  The detailed \nlaw regulating the court was to be set out in a protocol. But, it appears that this distinct court \ndevoted to economic integration issues will never be established. Its functions will now be \nperformed by the African Court of Justice and Human Rights [African Court of Justice].\n42\n \n                                                     \n33\n Constitutive Act of the African Union, supra note 7. \n34\n 6 June 1967, 6 International Legal Materials 932. \n35\n Ibid. art. 1(1). \n36\n Ibid. arts. 3, 30-31, 32-42. \n37\n S.K.B.

Annexed to the protocol is the Statute of the African Court of Justice and Human Rights [Statute of \nthe African Court of Justice]. The protocol is not yet in force. As at July 2009, only Libya had deposited its \ninstrument of ratification. \n8 \n \nThe African Court of Justice consists of sixteen judges who must all be nationals of states \nthat are parties to the Protocol on the African Court of Justice.\n43\n   \nThe subject matter jurisdiction of the African Court of Justice is broad. In theory, it \ncovers potentially any international dispute arising between states which are parties to the \nProtocol of the African Court of Justice. The jurisdiction of the African Court of Justice, as \noutlined in article 28 of the Statute on the African Court of Justice, is wide enough to cover \nthe AEC Treaty and any laws adopted by the AEC.  \nThe strength of a court depends not only on its independence and subject matter but also \nit personal jurisdiction. Under article 29 of the Statute of the African Court of Justice, the \nfollowing entities are entitled to submit cases to the court on \u2018any issue or dispute\u201944 provided \nfor in article 28:  states that are parties to the Protocol of the African Court of Justice; the \nAssembly; the Parliament and other organs of the AU authorised by the Assembly; and a staff \nmember of the AU.  A state that is not party to the protocol may not submit a case to the \nAfrican Court of Justice;\n45\n the court has no jurisdiction to hear a dispute involving such a \nparty. Equally, it does not appear that the RECs, the building blocks of the AEC, have \nstanding before the court. \nThe fact that the court has no jurisdiction over states that are not parties to the protocol, \neven though they may be parties to the AEC Treaty, poses a challenge to judicial enforcement \nof the treaty. Surely, under traditional international law, states, as an attribute of their \nsovereignty cannot be dragged to an international tribunal without their consent. But, in the \ncontext of regional economic integration,\n46\n this jurisdictional gap will not aid the uniform \napplication and enforcement of community law within member states.  In my opinion, this \njurisdictional gap is a reflection of inattention to the importance of legal issues in integration. \nA foundation for instability is laid where uneven obligations, in terms of the enforcement and \nenforceability of community law, are imposed on member states.  It is difficult to conceive of \na stable and effective economic community where community law is not uniformly \napplicable within and enforceable against member states.  Indeed, the very essence of \nintegration is defeated; \u2018uniformity in the meaning of law is part of the constitutional glue \nthat holds the Community together\u2019.47 \nIndividuals also have an important role to play in economic integration, not least in \nensuring the implementation of community laws. For example, the COMESA, EAC, \nECOWAS and SADC treaties provide fairly liberal rules on individuals\u2019 participation in the \n                                                     \n43\n Statute of the African Court of Justice, ibid. art. 3(1). \n44\n On human rights related disputes, the list of entities that can bring actions before the African Court of Justice \nto include: the African Commission on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights; the African Committee of Experts on the \nRights and Welfare of the Child; African Intergovernmental Organizations accredited to the Union or its organs; \nAfrican National Human Rights Institutions; and, for states that specifically agree to this, individuals or relevant \nNon-Governmental Organizations accredited to the African Union or to its organs. See Statute of the African \nCourt of Justice, supra note 42 art. 30. \n45\n Statute of the African Court of Justice, supra note 42 art. 18. \n46\n Such a jurisdictional gap might work in a purely political context. For example, except with its express \nconsent, the International Court of Justice has no jurisdiction over a states even if it is a member of members of \nthe United Nations and, ipso facto, party to the Statute of the International Court of Justice. The case of the \nAfrican Court of Justice represents an inappropriate extension to economic integration of an approach developed \nfor and workable in a purely political context. \n47\n S. Weatherill, Law and Integration in the European Union, Clarendon Press (1995), p. 135. \n9 \n \ncommunities\u2019 judicial processes. Indeed, to date, individuals have been responsible for almost \nthe entire disputes settled by their respective courts.\n48\n The Statute of the African Court of \nJustice adopts a radically different approach. Except for human rights claims, individuals \nhave no standing before the African Court of Justice. On matters relating to the interpretation, \nenforcement and validity of AEC laws, individuals cannot bring an action in the African \nCourt of Justice. A provision in the earlier Protocol on the Court of Justice of the African \nUnion,\n49\n which allowed individuals to access the court under conditions determined by the \nAssembly and with the consent of the state concerned, has been omitted from the Statute on \nthe African Court of Justice. Accordingly, the African Court of Justice resembles the \ninternational adjudication regime category in Schneider\u2019s typology of dispute settlement \nsystems.\n50\n Such a regime is ill-suited for the level of integration envisaged under the AEC \nTreaty, although it may adequately serve the needs of the AU \u2013 the political organisation.51 \nThe absence of locus standi for individuals restricts the number of potential disputes that \nmay be brought to the African Court of Justice.  It makes the dispute settlement process \nunavailable to some of the most important players in the integration process, including \nconsumers, traders, corporate bodies, and investors. It fails to utilise a principal medium \nthrough which community-state relationship is strengthened in economic integration. A \nplausible solution, which is still more restricting compared to the standing rules of COMESA, \nEAC and ECOWAS courts, will be to allow individuals to litigate before the African Court of \nJustice with the special leave of the court,\n52\n or after exhausting local remedies. Another \noption is to create a reference procedure between national courts and the African Court of \nJustice. This alternative will provide individuals with an indirect access to the court. \nIn general, governments are reluctant to submit to binding interstate dispute resolution \nprocesses. Indeed, of all the cases so far brought before the COMESA, EAC, ECOWAS and \nSADC courts only one involved inter-state parties.\n53\n In the absence of individual standing, \nthe African Court of Justice might be underused and may be consigned to \u2018abject inactivity \n                                                     \n48\n See e.g. Mike Campbell Ltd. v.

This \nprovision has been interpreted and applied by the Caribbean Court of Justice in Trinidad Cement Ltd. v. The \nState of the Co-operative Republic of Guyana [2009] C.C.J. 1 (OJ); Trinidad Cement Ltd. v. The Caribbean \nCommunity [2009] C.C.J. 2 (OJ). In both cases, the court granted the applicant leave to bring an action. \n53\n See Eritrea v. Ethiopia [1999] LawAfrica L. R. 6. \n10 \n \nand irrelevance\u2019,54as far as economic integration issues are concerned. One can only imagine \nwhat would have happened to the COMESA, ECOWAS and EAC courts if individuals did \nnot have standing before them. Granting private right of action will ensure the use of the \nAfrican Court of Justice, and prevent its descent into inactivity and irrelevance.   \nArguably, the absence of individual rights of action reflects a desire of states to dominate \nthe African Court of Justice, even if only indirectly, and cut off the court from any relations \nwith those most affected by economic integration.  The absence of individual standing is \ninconsistent with the position in other African regional economic treaties.  It is recommended \nthat any revisions of the Statute of the African Court of Justice should provide for individual \nstanding either directly, with special leave of the court or after exhausting local remedies, or \nindirectly through reference from national courts.\n55\n \nPerhaps, if the distinct identity of the AEC had been maintained and its economic \nintegration agenda and the concomitant needs of the agenda held in focus, these shortfalls \nmight have been avoided. As a court for the political organization, the AU, it is \nunproblematic; its structure and jurisdiction closely resemble the International Court of \nJustice of the United Nations. But, as a court which also has jurisdiction over economic \nintegration issues, its structure and jurisdiction are highly inadequate. To my knowledge, it is \nthe only court with jurisdiction over an economic integration agreement whose jurisdiction is \nnot compulsory. A party to the AEC Treaty which has not ratified the Protocol of the African \nCourt of Justice is not subject to the jurisdiction of the court.\n56\n As has been argued above, this \nwill seriously affect the application and enforcement of AEC law. Individuals and national \ncourts, key players in the success of any economic integration agenda have no direct or \nindirect relations with the courts. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nThe relationship between the AU, AEC and Africa\u2019s RECs is complex. I attribute this to two \nfactors. Firstly, there appears to be a lackadaisical approach to the legal aspects of the \neconomic integration being undertaking under the aegis of the AEC. It does not appear that \ntreaties and protocols are adopted with much careful thought on the complex legal issues \ninvolved in economic integration. It is the hope of this writer that the newly established \nAfrican Union Commission on International Law\n57\n will devote considerable space on its \nagenda to the legal aspects of economic integration on the continent. Secondly, there has been \na convolution of the two distinct ideas namely economic integration and political unification. \nThis has led to approaches to issues, including the establishment of institutions, that ill-serve \n                                                     \n54\n Tiyanjana Maluwa, \u2018The Peaceful Settlement of Disputes among African States, 1963-1983:  Some \nConceptual Issues and Practical Trends\u2019, 38 International and Comparative Law Quarterly (1989): 299 at 307. \n55\n Initially, the ECOWAS Court of Justice did not have jurisdiction to hear cases from individuals. It was \ngranted that jurisdiction through an amendment to its protocol. See Protocol A\/P.1\/1\/91 on the Economic \nCommunity of West African States Court of Justice (as amended Supplementary Protocol A\/SP.1\/11\/04).

African lawyers and legal academics are culpable in this state of \naffairs. The extent to which both groups have taken interest the economic integration agenda \nis doubtful.\n58\n This fact is reflected in the small number of books, journal and articles dealing \nwith the legal aspects of economic integration in Africa.\n59\n If Africa\u2019s economic integration is \nto succeed, its legal aspects has to be taken more seriously and it should be clearly divorced \nfrom the political unification agenda. Admittedly, the socio-economic and political \nchallenges that bedevil Africa\u2019s economic integration are enormous and real. However, in my \nopinion even if all these challenges were to disappear, there are so much in the realm of law \nwhich, if unaddressed, will still hinder the success and effectiveness of economic integration \nin Africa. \n \n                                                     \n58\n See generally Simon E.
