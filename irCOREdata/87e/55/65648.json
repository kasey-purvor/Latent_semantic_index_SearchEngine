WELLS'S CURRICULUM FOR THE FUTURE \n \n The Labour party must and does realize that a proper system of \nEducation is the nearest thing to a panacea for all ills that could be \ndevised, and also that their own future depends on a first-class and \nup-to-date method of education being placed within the reach of \nevery child in the country.  The present time is propitious because, \nnot only is the existing form of education admittedly poor, but also \nbecause new and better systems have been tried and proved. (\u2026) \n What is wanted is a book of practical detail but also a vision for \nthe future. \nH.G. Wells, 1923 proposal for an unwritten textbook in pedagogy.1 \n Few literary writers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries \nwere more closely or directly involved in the theory and practice of education \nthan H.G. Wells.  Wells grew up critical of the education he had received \nhimself, and as a writer his attention turned from an examination of his own \neducational circumstances to those of the whole world.  Wells became a \nprovocative critic of, and innovator within, the existing educational system.  'I \nhave always as a matter of conscience insulted schoolmasters,' he wrote to \nGeorge Gissing in 1898, also claiming in 1903's Mankind in the Making that \n'scolding the schoolmaster (\u2026) is an amusement so entirely congenial to my \ntemperament that I do not for one moment propose to abandon it.'2  Wells \nhad been a schoolmaster himself, training as a science teacher before making \na living as a writer.  His enormous subsequent output is dominated by a \ndesire to instruct, from the didacticism of his social novels to the schemes for \nsocial reconstruction in his later utopian writings, to the epitaph he famously \nclaimed for himself in 1941: 'I told you so.  You damned fools'.   \n Wells had never seen his art as necessarily existing in a separate realm \nfrom the desire to instruct.  In 1911, he gave a talk to the Times Book Club on \n'The Scope of the Novel', subsequently rewritten for An Englishman Looks at \nthe World (1914).  In the address, Wells makes bold claims for the required \nparticipation of art, and of the novel in particular, in the coming necessary \n                                                 \n1The Correspondence of H.G. Wells, 4 vols (London: Pickering and Chatto, 1998), ed. by David \nC. Smith, III, p. 135.   \n2George Gissing and H.G. Wells: Their Friendship and Correspondence, ed. by Royal A. Gettmann \n(London: Hart-Davis, 1961), p. 94; Mankind in the Making (London: Chapman and Hall, \n1903), p. 222.    \n 2\nreorganisation of the social and intellectual world.  The novel as an art form is \ninherently, he argues, a 'powerful instrument of suggestion', and no \nestablished idea should be exempt from being addressed and criticised by it.3  \nRather, novelists should engage more directly in writing about 'that \ncomplicated system of uneasy adjustments and readjustments which is \nmodern civilisation'.4  Henry James reproved Wells for the loose \n'inclusiveness' of this vision, and their famous falling-out resulted in part \n1from Wells's rejection of James's requirement of a measured aesthetic \ndistance from the wider world.5  Such a stance, for Wells, threatened to \nnegate the value of Art altogether.   \n Wells saw himself as writing in the tradition of the public intellectual, \nsharing with his predecessors Adam Smith, Robert Owen, John Stuart Mill, \nJohn Ruskin, and Matthew Arnold a lively interest in education as social \npolicy.  To this end, along with his University biology teacher T.H. Huxley, \nWells advocated compulsory scientific teaching in schools.6  An emerging \ntheme in such nineteenth-century writing about education was that it might \nbe made more exact a practice by the applicat7ion of scientific methods.8 \n9Theories of education might for Wells come to have the status of scientific \ntruth.   \n A competing strand in Victorian rhetoric about education, however, \nespecially later in the nineteenth century, was a sense of impending disaster.  \nEconomic anxiety had played a large part in initiating of the period's \neducational reforms. Britain was beginning to fear that her economic rivals \nwere outstripping her in technological advancement, a development \nhighlighted by the poor showing of British manufactures in the International \nExhibition staged in Paris in 1867.10  Reforms such as the founding in 1853 of \n                                                 \n3'The Contemporary Novel', An Englishman Looks at the World (London: Cassell, 1914), pp. \n148-69 (p. 159). \n4 The Contemporary Novel', p. 148. \n5See Henry James and H.G Wells: A Record of their Friendship, their Debate on the Art of Fiction and \ntheir Quarrel, ed. by Leon Edel and Gordon N. Ray (London: Hart-Davis, 1958). \n6On nineteenth-century education as a means of social control, see Anne Digby and Peter \nSearby, Children, School and Society in Nineteenth-Century England (London and \nBasingstoke: Macmillan, 1981), pp. 23-28. \n7  \n8See for instance, Alexander Bain, Education as a Science (London: Kegan Paul, 1879); John \nLawson and Harold Silver, A Social History of Education in England (London: Methuen, \n1973), p. 353.   \n9  \n10Harold Silver, Education as History: Interpreting Nineteenth- and Twentieth-Century \nEducation (London: Methuen, 1983), pp81-99; Brian Simon, 'Systematisation and \nSegmentation: The case of England', in The Rise of the Modern Educational Systerm: \n 3\nthe Science and Art Department, or Forster's 1870 Education Act tended to be \ninstituted not as progressive per se, but in order to prevent a perceived \nnational crisis.11  The Royal Commission on Scientific Instruction and the \nAdvancement of Science of 1871-75, led by the Duke of Devonshire William \nCavendish (whom Wells credited with 'unexpected breadth of sympathy') \nreported Britain's shortage of science teachers as 'a national misfortune'.12  \nWells inherited and amplified this strain of argument.  A recurrent theme in \nhis social vision is the competition between order and waste, at its most \nemphatic in Wells's diagnoses of national decay Tono-Bungay (1909) and The \nNew Machiavelli (1911).13  As a utopianist,  Wells had a natural tendency to \nthink in terms of organisation, of order, of local competence.  Like Oswald in \nWells's 1918 educational novel Joan and Peter, Wells 'belonged to that minority \nof Englishmen who think systematically, whose ideas join on'.14  Education in \nparticular has a duty to prevent waste in both demonstrating to and instilling \nin its recipients the virtues of system and organisation: \n(Oswald's) intelligence told him that all the inefficiency, the \nconfusion, the cheap and bad government by press and intrigue, \nwere the necessary and inevitable consequences of a neglect of \nhigher education for the past fifty years.15      \n In his rise from unpropitious lower middle-class beginnings, Wells had \nhad to fight off successive apprenticeships that would have curtailed his own \neducational progress.  After achieving international literary and political \ncelebrity, Wells remained always aware of how easily his own considerable \npotential might have been wasted.  With characteristic 'joined-on thinking', \nwhen reviewing his own development in 1934's Experiment in Autobiography, \n                                                                                                                                           \nStructural Change and Social Reproduction 1870-1920, ed. by Detlef K.

Wells will be to the Atlantic \nEdition.   \n15Joan and Peter, Works, XXIV, p. 326.   \n 4\nWells sees it in terms of broader social change.  He correctly identifies the \nreforms that brought him a scientific education as the result of economic \nanxiety about other better-educated countries, particularly Germany.  He also \ninterprets the role of the new educational reforms of the late nineteenth \ncentury not as instituting a meritocratic ladder that would surmount social \ndivisions, but as negotiating a compromise that would perpetuate them:16 \nThe new order of things that was appearing in the world when I \nwas born, was already arousing a consciousness of the need for \nuniversal elementary education.  It was being realized by the ruling \nclasses that a nation with a lower stratum of illiterates would \ncompete at a disadvantage against the foreigner.  A condition of \nthings in which everyone would read and write and do sums, \ndawned on the startled imagination of mankind.  The British and \nthe National Schools, which had existed in order to make little \nNonconformists and little Churchmen, were organized into a state \nsystem under the Elementary Education Act of 1871 and \nsupplemented by Board Schools (designed to make little \nUnsectarian Christians.) (\u2026) Few people realize the immense \nchanges that the organization and mechanism of popular teaching \nhave undergone in the last century.17  \nWells's schooling began at a small private school, Morley's Commercial \nAcademy, where he learnt mostly arithmetic and double-entry book-keeping.  \n'The Education Act of 1871 was not an Act for a common universal education, \nit was an Act to educate the lower classes for employment on lower-class \nlines' (I, p. 93).  Morley was the only teacher, 'so the primary impression left \nupon my brain by that Academy are not impressions of competent \nelucidation and guidance, of a universe being made plain to me or of skills \nbeing acquired and elaborated, but of the moods of Mr. Thomas Morley and \ntheir consequences' (I, pp. 88-89).  Wells gives his schoolmaster credit for \nability in teaching mathematics, but accuses the language teaching of doing \nmore harm than good: 'He crippled my French for life.  He made me vowel-\nshy in every language' (I, p. 91).   Throughout the first volume of the  \nAutobiography, Wells emphasises the faults of the education that he received \nhimself to outline the elements a modern curriculum ought to contain: \n                                                 \n16See Brian Simon, 'Education and Citizenship in England', in The State and Educational \nChange: Essays in the History of Education and Pedagogy (London: Lawrence and Wishart, \n1994), pp. 75-83 (p. 76).   \n17Experiment in Autobiography, 2 vols (London: Gollancz: 1934), I, p. 84, p. 87.  Compare Peter \nSearby, 'The Schooling of Kipps: The Education of Lower Middle-Class Boys in England', \nin Educating the Victorian Middle Class, ed. by Peter Searby (Leicester: History of \nEducation Society, 1982), pp. 113-31.   \n 5\nscience, languages, world history and the development of a spirit of \nimaginative, critical curiosity.18   \n At fourteen, Wells felt that he was being removed from his schooling \nfar too early; later, he would argue that this age was too young for anyone to \ncease receiving organised learning (I, p. 132).  Apprenticed to a draper, Wells \nrebelled against the restraints that were imposed by labour on the \ndevelopment of his imagination, reading books beneath his desk, and, he \nclaims, completing algebra exercises in his spare time.  Wells was found \ninsufficiently refined to pursue the career of a draper, and after a proposal for \nhim to become a pupil-teacher at a school run by a relative fell through, Wells \nwas again apprenticed, to a chemist in Midhurst.  As part of his training, \nWells was required to learn Latin, and was tutored by the headmaster of \nMidhurst Grammar School, Horace Byatt.  It was Byatt to whom Wells wrote \nfor help before running away from his third and final apprenticeship (with \nanother draper), insisting to his mother that he should return to school.  \nWells, as D.H. Lawrence later would, became a pupil-teacher, taking \nexaminations to improve his own and the school's standing: by performing \nwell, he would earn extra grants for the school.  His results were so good, \nhowever, that he won a scholarship to the Normal School of Science in \nKensington.   \n This was Wells's first direct encounter with a science more practical \nthan that learnt at the remove of cramming and textbooks, and he credits this \nexperience with instilling in him the habit of thinking in systems, and \nconnections:  \nHere were microscopes, dissections, models, diagrams close to the \nobjects they elucidated, specimens, museums, ready answers to \nquestions, explanations, discussions (\u2026) an extraordinary mental \nenlargement as my mind passed from the printed sciences within \nbook covers to these intimate real things and then radiated outward \nto a realization that the synthesis of the sciences composed a vital \ninterpretation of the world. (I, pp. 199-200).19   \n The excitement of studying biology under Huxley in his first year \nsubsided, however, when he became bored by the dull rigours of studying \nphysics and geology, choosing to develop his imagination by reading Carlyle \nand Blake in the library.  (He had objected in particular to the waste of time in \n                                                 \n18'Schooling', Mankind in the Making, pp. 198-237. \n19For Wells's ideas at the time as to how science should be taught, see Correspondence, I, p. \n161, pp. 169-74, pp. 180-81, pp. 251-53, Preface to A Textbook of Biology, rev edn., 2 vols \n(London: University Correspondence College Press, [1894]), I, pp. vii-x.   \n 6\nto being required to make his own apparatus; later, as a science teacher, Wells \nwould circumvent the risks to the dignity of the teacher that practical \ndemonstration threatened by drawing the results of experiments in coloured \nchalks on the black board instead.)  In the Autobiography, Wells is severe on \nthe truculence of his younger self, but equally critical of the impractical and \nprimitive teaching methods used to instruct him.  He finds it: \nmore and more remarkable that the old Normal School and Royal \nSchool of Mines, the present Imperial College of Science and \nTechnology, although an important part of its work still consists in \npreparing teachers of science, had never had, had not now and \nnever seems likely to have, any chair, lecturer or course in \neducational science and method.  Much less is there any study of \nsocial, economic and political science, any enquiry as to objectives, \nor any attempt to point, control and co-ordinate the teaching in the \nvarious departments.  (\u2026) The Imperial College,  I realize in the \nretrospect, was and still is in fact not a college but a sprawl of \nlaboratories and class rooms.  Whatever ideas of purpose wrestled \ntogether in its beginnings are now forgotten.  It has no firm idea of \nwhat it is and what it is supposed to do.  That is to say it has no \nphilosophy.  It has no philosophical organization, no social idea, no \nrationalized goal, to hold it together .... I do not see how we can \nhope to arrest and control the disastrous sprawling of the world's \naffairs, until we have first pulled the philosophical and educational \nsprawl together. (I, pp. 231-32)20 \nBy the time he left the Normal School, Wells's interests had become not only \nscientific but socialist and literary; a scientific education was no longer \nsufficient alone to occupy his reawakened and curious speculative \nintelligence.  Wells's ideal of 'a liberal education' was to involve the \napplication of the truth-seeking habits he had learnt from science to the world \noutside the laboratory.   \n After graduating in 1887, Wells worked as a teacher, an experience \nreworked in the 1900 novel Love and Mr Lewisham.  As he is of all of the \neducational institutions through which he passed, Wells is critical of the \ncurriculum at Henley House.  His censure of this school's teaching again \nprovides an insight into what Wells believed the chief end of education to be: \nWe were teaching some \"subjects,\" as the times went, fairly well, we \nwere getting more than average results in outside examinations.  \nBut collectively, comprehensively we were teaching nothing at all.  \n                                                 \n20The first University chair in Education had only been established in 1876 (at Edinburgh and \nSt Andrews) as a result of a bequest, and such teacher-training as such that there was in \nthe late nineteenth century tended to be exclusively for women: H.C. Barnard, A History \nof English Education from 1760, 2nd edn. (London: University of London Press, 1961), p. \n190.   In Joan and Peter, Mackinder, the headmaster of the preparatory school White Court, \nmakes the same complaint: Works, XXIII, p. 385. \n 7\nWe were completely ignoring the primary function of the school in \nsociety, which is to correlate the intelligence, will and conscience of \nthe individual to the social process.  (\u2026) We taught no history of \nhuman origins, nothing about the structure of civilization, nothing \nof social or political life.  We did not make, we did not even attempt \nto make participating citizens. (I, p. 325) \n An injury from a foul in a football match during an earlier teaching \npost in Wrexham resulted in a lengthy illness, curtailing Wells's career as a \nschoolteacher.  He became a correspondence tutor, standardising and \nsystematising exam preparation in biology by analysing past papers.  During \nthis period, Wells's first books were written, Honours Physiography, (with the \nbiologist Richard Gregory), and A Textbook of Biology (both 1893).  He was also \nco-founder and editor of the Science Schools Journal, and a reviewer for the \nEducational Times, in the course of which 'educational theory was forced upon \nme' (Autobiography, I, p. 350).  In time, however, Wells earned more from \njournalism than he could from tutoring, thus beginning his career as an \nimaginative writer and self-appointed teacher to the world.  Insisting on 'the \nimperative necessity of scientific method in public affairs', Wells went on to \noutline a series of utopias in which education would play a crucial part.21  \n Wells's most frequent educational cause in this period is the \npopularising of scientific ideas, the subject of much of his early journalism.22  \nThe corresponding target in his polemic was the teaching of Latin and Greek.  \nWells had found the learning of Latin stimulating for its systematic and \nregular properties, but favoured a creative synthesis of sciences and \nhumanities rather than an training in one exclusive of the other.  He argued \nthat to encourage cleverer students to favour classics, and the less able to \nspecialise in science, as was often the case, was hopelessly backward-looking, \nand even potentially threatened disaster.23 Wells's writing frequently \nportrayed apocalypse as the only possible future alternative to his planned \nutopia, and sometimes even welcomed catastrophe as providing opportunity \nfor wholesale reconstruction from fundamentals upwards, as in 1908's The \nWar in the Air and 1913's The World Set Free.  'Human history becomes more \nand more a race between education and catastrophe,' he famously wrote in \n                                                 \n21What is Coming: A Forecast of Things After the War (London: Cassell, 1916), p. 101. \n22See H.G. Wells, Early Writings in Science and Science Fiction, ed. by Robert M. Philmus and \nDavid Y. Hughes (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1975). \n23Mankind in the Making, pp. 201-10.  For Wells's view of the correct relationship between \nscience and the classics, see his 'The Case against the Classical Languages' in Sir Ray \nLankester, ed., Natural Science and the Classical System in Education (London: Heinemann, \n1918), pp. 183-95, and the report on the eleventh annual meeting of the British Science \nGuild in Nature, 99 (1917), 186-87.   \n 8\n1920's The Outline of History.24  Education should provide a necessary outlet \nfor youthful imagination and creativity, making sure that no potential for \nindividual development is wasted, while fashioning pupils into responsible \nfuture citizens who will co-operate in the future commonwealth, or World \nState, described in detail as early as 1905's A Modern Utopia.  'Men's loyalties , \nthe sides they take in political things, are not innate, they are educational \nresults,' Wells wrote in the Outline.25  Perhaps surprisingly, this utopian but, \nWells believed, fully possible, international polity will be created at first not \nby Science, but by the correct teaching of History, a history that will instruct \npupils with the need for the creation of a World State.  \n This need became, for Wells, more urgent with the threat and \nsubsequent outbreak of the Great War.  The World Set Free foresees not only a \nclash between European powers resulting from Balkan struggles for self-\ndetermination, but also an atomic war later in the century.  In this version of \nfuture history, national populations and world leaders alike are inspired by \nthe idealist King Egbert to renounce their nationhood in order to put an end \nto war.  In real life, Wells believed, such a political transformation could not \ntake place unless the world's populations were made to question the concept \nof nations, and that this could only be achieved by teaching a form of history \nthat would emphasise the community between nations, and the common \norigin of mankind, rather than only the history of one's own country.26   \n Recent developments in Germany provided a negative analogue for \nsuch a project.  A state established as recently as 1871, Germany's new rulers \nhad needed to create an new national identity to bind its previously separate \nstates together, and had reorganised its educational system accordingly.27 \nWells deplored the ends to which German Kultur had been directed, writing \nin 1916, 'Their minds have been systematically corrupted by base historical \nteaching, and the inculcation of a rancid patriotism.  They are a people under \nthe sway of organised suggestion.'28  He was impressed, however, by the \neffectiveness of a Herbartian exercise that could,  in the space of a single \ngeneration, rewrite the received ideas of a whole country for an ideological \npurpose.  As with the superiority of Germany's technical advancement, the \n                                                 \n24The Outline of History, Being a Plain History of Life and Mankind (London: Newnes, 1920), 2 \nvols, II, p. 758.  \n25Ibid., p. 557.   \n26Compare Autobiography, I, p. 99. \n27See Detlef K. M\u00fcller, 'The Process of Systematisation: The Case of German Secondary \nEducation', in M\u00fcller et al., eds., pp. 15-52.   \n28What is Coming, p. 272; see also p. 229, Outline, p. 693. \n 9\nefficiency of the her Gymnasien highlighted the chaotic nature of how the \nprocess was carried out elsewhere: \nGermany was different; Germany was teaching and teaching in \nschools, colleges, press, everywhere, this new Imperialism of hers, a \nsort of patriotic melodrama, with Britain as Carthage and Berlin \ninstead of Rome.  They pointed the whole population to that end.  \nThey taught this war.  All over the world a thousand other \neducational systems pointed in a thousand other directions.29   \n The First World War proved that education misapplied could indeed \nlead to catastrophe: 'all this vast disaster to the world was no more and no \nless than an educational failure' (Joan and Peter, XXIV, p. 243).  The content and \nmethod of future education must occupy a vital part in the period of \nreconstruction following the War:  \nThis and no other is the hour for educational reconstruction.  And it \nis in the decisions and readjustments of schools and lectures and \ncourses, far more than anywhere else, that the real future of Great \nBritain will be decided.30 \n Wells's post-Great War novel The Undying Fire (1919) is 'Dedicated to \nAll Schoolmasters and Schoolmistresses and every Teacher in the World', and \nsets out the author's intended educational program in only barely \nfictionalised form.  The book is intended as a present-day rewriting of the \nBook of Job from Wells's own peculiar theological standpoint.31  Its central \ncharacter, Job Huss, is headmaster of a progressive school, whose faith is \ntested when, after a wager between God and Satan, he loses his son in the \nwar, his savings in a financial disaster, four pupils and a schoolmaster in a \nseries of accidents, and his position at the school.  Job's marriage \nconsequently suffers, and, while staying at a seaside result, he discovers he \nhas cancer.  The novel is written mostly in dialogue on matters curricular and \ntheological between the headmaster and the school governors and colleagues \nwho visit him.  On principles of which the author evidently approves, Job has \nmodernised the school's teaching of science, added Spanish and Russian to its \nlanguage options, and vigorously promoted the teaching of history.32  As \n                                                 \n29Joan and Peter, Works, XXIV, p. 258. \n30What is Coming, p. 152.   \n31During the 1910s, Wells flirted with a kind of deist religious belief, dramatised in novels \nsuch as Mr Britling Sees It Through (1916) and The Soul of a Bishop, and the non-fictional \nGod the Invisible King (1917).  These views were explicity repudiated later in the semi-\nautobiographical The World of William Clissold (1926) and Wells's later autobiography.    \n32See Mankind in the Making, pp. 208-09 on Wells's view of the poor quality of language-\nteaching in 1903, and What is Coming, pp. 124-25. \n 10\nWells argued that ideology and politics cannot, and must not be excluded \nfrom art, so Job argues that education is also of necessity polemical.  His \ndoctor sides with Job: \n\"It's one of the things I can never understand about schoolmasters \nand politicians and suchlike, the way they seem to take it for \ngranted you can educate and not bring in religion and socialism and \nall your beliefs.  What is education?  Teaching young people to talk \nand read and write and calculate in order that they may be told how \nthey stand in the world and what we think we and the world are \ngenerally up to, and the part we expect them to play in the game.  \nWell, how can we do that and at the same time leave it all out?  \nWhat is the game?  That is what every youngster wants to know.  \nAnswering him, is education.\"33   \nHistory is promoted even over science in this ideal curriculum, since, Job \nargues, ignorance of history results in the poor social organisation which \nprevents the effective application of science.   \nThey solve the problems of material science in vain until they have \nsolved their social and political problems. (\u2026) It is no occult secret; \nit is a plain and demonstrable thing to-day that the world could \ngive ample food and ample leisure to every human being, if only by \na world-wide teaching the spirit of unity could be made to prevail \nover the impulse to dissension.34  \nThe teaching of the origins of Man is crucial as the starting-point of \nthis collective history.  Just as the wider teaching of a greater number of \nlanguages will further mutual understanding, so knowledge of mankind's \nshared origin will deconstruct the myths of English or German racial \nsupremacy.35  In The Undying Fire, the foundation of the World State is loosely \nidentified with God's purpose for Man, and thus a Wellsian education \nbecomes a kind of sacred duty.  Job's faith in God (or Wells) is finally \nrewarded.  A distant relative dies, leaving him a fortune; the tumour proves \nto be benign; ex-pupils rally round to protect Huss's job and reforms, and a \ntelegram brings the news that his son is not dead, but a prisoner of war.   \n Wells's conclusions were not always so resolute, however, reflecting \nhis anxiety that although the right sort of educational ideas now exist, they \nmay never be put into practice.  The 1924 Preface to Joan and Peter, a novel \n                                                 \n33 The Undying Fire, Works, XI, pp. 108-09. \n34 The Undying Fire, Works, XI, p. 140.  \n35Wells ruefully noted that even while he was teaching in the final decade of the nineteenth \ncentury, evolution was still too controversial a topic to be included on the syllabus; Man \ndoes not even enter the Outline of History until page 39; compare The Undying Fire, XI, pp. \n112-13, Outline, I, p. 86. \n 11\npublished a year before The Undying Fire, claims this novel was 'designed to \nreview the possibilities of a liberal education in contemporary England' (XXIII, \np. ix).  Joan and Peter is less formally structured around a single issue that The \nUndying Fire.  Like most of Wells's middle-period fiction, it is highly \ndiscursive and very loosely structured; like the War whose effects the novel \ndramatises, poor organisation renders it unnecessarily long.  Joan and Peter's \nlarger scope, however, allows a much fuller dramatisation of the effects of the \ndifferent kinds of education its eponymous hero and heroine receive, and its \nstructure attempts to mirror the process of growing-up and being educated: \nthe novel's penultimate chapter is entitled 'Joan and Peter Graduate'.   \n In early childhood, foster-siblings Joan and Peter Stubland are \norphaned by a boating accident.  Although their parents Arthur and Dolly \nhad agreed on their uncle Oswald as a suitable guardian, Arthur, secretly \njealous, alters his will to make Oswald only one of four joint guardians.  The \nchildren's care thus passes first to two aunts Phyllis and Phoebe, New \nWomen aesthetes, who become more parodically out-of-date as the novel \nprogresses, and who force on the children the wrong kind of 'progressive' \neducation.  Their physician 'had the usual general practitioners' view that any \neducation whatever is a terrible strain on the young, and he was quite on the \nside of Rousseau in that matter' (XXIII, p. 34).  The narrator mocks the idea that \nchildren will develop naturally if left to their own devices; the haphazard and \nunsystematised nature of Wells's own education had convinced him of the \ndangers of too much freedom.  (In 1931, Wells admitted to a 'pretty hard \ndislike' of A.S. Neill, the founder of Summerhill, thinking his method 'only \nsuited (like the Montessori system) for badly disorganized children & \nadolescents', since it disregards 'the natural anti-social instinct'.)36  Wells's \neducationalism was anti-Rousseau: unsupervised development leads to chaos \nand, consequently, disorder and waste.   \n The headmistress of the undisciplined and artistic school to which \ntheir aunts send the children has a training that is well-intentioned but \nunsystematic: \nShe had already done the Theory and Practice of Education part of \nthe diploma.  For that she had read parts of \"Leonard and Gertrude\" \nand she had attended five lectures on Froebel.  These were days \n                                                 \n36Correspondence, III, p. 405.  Compare an entirely opposite utopian view of education in \nWilliam Morris, News from Nowhere: Or An Epoch of Rest: Being Some Chapters from a \nUtopian Romance by William Morris, ed. by Krishan Kumar (Cambridge: Cambridge \nUniversity Press, 1995), pp. 31-34, pp. 66-67, in which spontaneous development as \nteaching supplants schooling altogether, and history barely read at all.   \n 12\nlong before the Montessori system which is now so popular with \nour Miss Millses; the prevalent educational vogues of the nineties \nwere kindergarten and Swedish drill. (XXIII, pp. 160-61) \nThe School of St. George and the Venerable Bede is not all bad, but modish \nand disorganised, so fails to reward the curiosity of its pupils.  Wells's young \nprotagonists are constantly eager for the stimulation of the new, whether \nsupplied by play or by systematised instruction.  Children grow 'as children \ndo grow under favourable circumstances, after the manner of Nature in her \nbetter moods, that is to say that is to say after the manner of Nature ploughed \nand weeded and given light and air' (XXIII, p. 156).  The metaphor of \nagriculture is a fertile one for Wells here, and perhaps an intended correction \nof Froebel's image of the kindergarten.  The process of education may be one of \nnatural growth, but a growth that requires careful cultivation; schooling must \nbe practical, with a definite end in view, like farming, not aesthetic, like \ngardening.37  Uncultivated, the mind might easily fall into harmful habits, \nsuch as the belief of the children's maths mistress that seven sevens might \nsometimes equal fifty-six.   \n Aunt Phoebe is content for Peter to play 'like a happy little animal' \n(XXIII, p. 106); this is exactly what Wells's biological imagination fears if he is \nleft to develop naturally.38  Job warns in The Undying Fire: that 'an untaught \nman is but himself alone, as lonely in his ends and destiny as any beast; a \nman instructed is a man enlarged from that narrow prison of self' (XI, p. 47).  \nOswald agrees: \nReligion, loyalty, patriotism, those strange and wonderfully \ninterwoven nets of superstition, fear, flattery, high reason and love, \nhave subjugated this struggling egotistical ape into larger and larger \nmasses of co-operation, achieved enormous temporary securities.  \nBut the ape is still there, struggling subtly. (XXIV, p. 34) \nFor Oswald as for Wells, 'Education is socialisation.  Education is the process \nof making the unsocial individual a citizen' (XXIII, p. 361).39    \n As the example of Germany shows, education can be self-conscious \nabout its duty to instil values, yet still teach the wrong values: religious \neducation may do similar harm.  While Wells was not at this stage anti-\nreligious, he felt strongly that religion should not be allowed a monopoly on \nwhat is taught by education.  (He cites within this novel the seminary in \n                                                 \n37Barnard, p. 173.  Compare The Story of a Great Schoolmaster, Works, XXIV, p. 359. \n38For Wells's anxiety over Man as an animal, see Peter Kemp, H.G. Wells and the Culminating \nApe: Biological Themes and Imaginative Obsessions (London: Macmillan, 1982). \n39Compare The World Set Free, Works, XXI, p. 208). \n 13\nPortrait of the Artist as a Young Man as an example of the worst kind of \neducation subordinated to religion).  The children's other aunt, the tyrannical \nLady Charlotte Sydenham, typifies the misapplication of politics and religion \nto the question of education (see XXIII, pp. 274-75).  As appalled by the \nsecularism of Joan and Peter's upbringing, as she is by the centralising \ntendency of 'Mr Balfour's Education Act' (which attempted to bring more \nschools into municipal control), Lady Charlotte has the children kidnapped \nand privately educated according to her own misguided beliefs.  Lady \nCharlotte is the first of the children's guardians to discriminate against Joan \nfor her illegitimacy (she is in fact the love-child of Dolly's brother), and Joan is \nfarmed out to the careless servant Mrs Pybus, under whose care she falls \ndangerously ill.  Peter is sent to a private school very like Mr Creakle's \nAcademy in David Copperfield.  High Cross Preparatory School is little better \nthan a violent examination-factory, and after one punishment too many, Peter \nruns away, and both children pass into the care of their uncle, the well-\nintentioned Empire-builder Oswald. \n Returning from Africa, Oswald learns of a witness who had seen Dolly \ntrying to swim towards the shore after her husband had already drowned: \nher will thus takes priority and Oswald becomes the children's sole guardian.  \nOswald's agonies over the best education for his wards occupy the whole of \nthe chapter 'A Searching of Schoolmasters' (which owes much to Wells's own \nattempts to find a suitable school for his own two sons, born in 1902 and \n1903).  Oswald, unlike the boy's previous guardians, asks Peter what he \nwould like to learn: \n \"There's a lot you don't know yet.\" said Oswald. \n \"Can't I read it out of books?\" asked Peter. \n \"You can't read everything out of books,\" said Oswald.  \"There's \nthings you ought to see and handle.  And things you can only learn \nby doing.\" \n Oswald wanted Peter to plan his own school. \n Peter considered.  \"I'd like lessons about the insides of animals \nand about the people in foreign countries \u2013 and how engines work \u2013\n and all that sort of thing.\" \n \"Then we must find a school for you where they teach all that \nsort of thing,\" said Oswald, as though it was merely a question of \nordering goods from the Civil Service Stores\u2026 \n He had much to learn yet about education. (XXIII, pp. 341-42) \nOswald is frustrated by the lack of any centralised source of information on \nschools and, naturally, he fails to find one that reaches all his stringent \nrequirements of teaching world history, economics and science.  When \nOswald does meets a headmaster who shares his own progressive views, he \n 14\nlearns that even mildly progressive public schools must be run on profitable \nlines and still appeal to more conservative parents, this also a symptom of the \nworld's economic disorganisation.   \n Oswald is no more impressed by Oxford and Cambridge, even Ruskin \nCollege, which dispiritingly 'reminded him of Jude the Obscure' (XXIII, p. 370).40  \nHe concludes that 'the real work of higher education, the discussion of God, \nof the state and sex, of all the great issues in life' (XXIII, p. 373) is being evaded \nby the universities and carried out by politically-minded writers such as G.K. \nChesterton, Hilaire Belloc, and Wells.  Oswald objects especially to Wells for \nhis commercial background; this is a self-conscious joke at the author's \nexpense, but the genuine objection on the part of both author and character is \nthat extra-curricular reading as the provider of true higher education is too \nunsystematic.  In the kind of educational order that Wells envisions, there \nwould ideally be no need for him to write such polemic.  Oswald also comes \nto consider the unsatisfactory nature of women's education available for Joan, \nwho goes to Newnham College, Cambridge.  Ultimately, however, his \ninvestigations are rendered moot by the First World War, which enforces the \ncontinuation of Joan and Peter's education in a wholly different sphere.  The \nnovel ends with a 'valediction' on education delivered by Oswald to the by-\nnow married Joan and Peter, but the world still unchanged and anxiously \nfacing reconstruction after the devastation of the war. \n After the speculative experiments in education within his fiction, in \n1918 Wells seriously began trying to educate the world himself.  A major \nobstacle to the kind of teaching he wished to promulgate was the lack of \ntextbooks that shared his own political world-view.41  Though by his own \nadmission not a specialist historian, Wells took it upon himself to write for \nthe world the history its political future needed, cribbing from the \nEncyclopaedia Britannica and asking historians for expert advice.42  Joan and \nPeter had been deeply engaged with 'history' both as a subject taught in \nschool and as the dialectical process being enacted in the real world.43  Wells \n                                                 \n40Compare What is Coming, pp. 149-50. \n41For the intended aims of the Outline, see the 1918 essay 'History is One', reprinted in Works, \nXVII, pp. 1-16.   \n42A.B. McKillop argues in The Spinster and the Prophet (London: Aurum, 2001) that Wells \nplagiarized parts of the Outline from an unpublished manuscript by Florence Deeks.  For \na hostile account of Wells's omissions see William T. Ross, H.G. Wells's World Reborn: The \nOutline of History and its Companions (Selinsgrove: Susquehanna University Press; \nLondon: Associated University Presses, 2002).   \n43 Cf. 'History, for her, has ceased to be a fabric of picturesque incidents; it is the study of a \ntragic struggle that still goes on.' The Secret Places of the Heart, Works, XXV, p. 464.   \n 15\nclearly perceived the latter as the determined consequence of the former.  The \nworld's politics and social organisation were a causal product of the history \nits leaders had been taught at school: 'the Outline of History is going to \nchange History,' Wells boasted to Rebecca West.44  In his rejection of \nuniversity curricula, Oswald had 'considered any history fragmentary that \ndid not begin with the geological record and end with a clear tracing of every \ntraceable consequence of the \"period\" in current affairs' (XXIII, p. 444).  This is \nexactly the scope of the textbook Wells went on to write.  'The book will rouse \nanybody in the history textbook & history teaching line to blind fury,' he \nproclaimed in a letter.  It is a serious raid into various departments of special \nknowledge (\u2026). It is a necessary counter to nationalism & imperialism.  There \nwill be a sustained attempt to [represent?] me as an ignorant interloper & \ndispose of me in that way.'45 \nThe Outline of History  was published in twenty-four monthly parts \nfrom November 1919 with footnotes by six collaborators, who also helped \nWells re-draft the work in its numerous successive editions.46  In 1927, he \nclaimed that it had brought him over \u00a360,000: David C. Smith has argued that \nthe commercial success of the Outline and its spin-offs is the pivotal moment \nin Wells's campaign to educate the world, allowing him to be more \nexperimental as a teacher and a prophet in his subsequent fiction.47  The \nOutline made the Wellsian view of the world more prominent than even he \ncould ever have hoped, selling two million copies in Britain and the US alone, \nand being widely adopted in schools.  A version for the general reader, A \nShort History of the World, followed in 1922, and two companion volumes were \nwritten (although the process of collaboration on these was more \nproblematic): The Science of Life (1930), with Wells's son Gyp and T.H. \nHuxley's son Julian, on biology and physical science, and The Work, Wealth \nand Happiness of Mankind (1931), covering economics and politics.  All were \nrepublished and revised, the Short History especially enjoying an extensive \nafterlife: it reappeared in a schools version abridged by E.H. Carter in 1925, a \nrevised version in 1946, and again in 1951, revised by Raymond Postgate and \nG.P. Wells.  Penguin reissued the volume once more in 2005.   \n                                                 \n44 H.G. Wells and Rebecca West, ed. Gordon  N.

See Smith, pp. 249-59 for \nthe enormous popular response to the Outline, including Hilaire Belloc's objections to the \nwork's hostile account of Catholicism.   \n 16\n Wells's interest in education continued beyond the numerous revisions \nof the Outline of History and throughout his life: in 1937, for instance, a month \nbefore his seventy-first birthday Wells delivered a lengthy address to Section \nL of the British Advancement of Science on life education.48  He became \ninvolved in the actual practice of education in his collaboration on the \ncurriculum of Oundle School, where he sent his own sons.49  Oundle's \nheadmaster F.W. Sanderson was the acknowledged model for Westinghouse, \n(named Henderson in the first edition of the novel), the forward-thinking \nheadmaster of Caxton School in Joan and Peter.  Sanderson died suddenly in \n1922 in front of Wells and an audience of the Union of Scientific Workers, \nshortly after delivering an address on 'The Duty and Service of Science in the \nNew Era'.  As a tribute, Wells began to compile an official volume Sanderson \nof Oundle, whose proceeds were devoted to the school, but Sanderson's \nwidow objected to Wells's portrayal, so he wrote his own account instead.50  \nThe Story of a Great Schoolmaster was published in 1923 in The New Leader and \nThe New Republic (which had also serialised Joan and Peter), in book form a \nyear later, and included in volume 24 of the Atlantic edition, following the \nsecond part of Joan and Peter.  The scale of the tribute Wells pays indicates the \nstore he set by the kind of education undertaken at Oundle: \nOf all the men I have met (\u2026) only one has stirred me to a \nbiographical effort.  This one exception is F.W. Sanderson, for many \nyears the headmaster of Oundle School.  I think him beyond \nquestion the greatest man I have ever known with any degree of \nintimacy. (\u2026) To tell his story is to reflect upon all the main \neducational ideas of the last half-century, and to revise our \nconception of the process and purpose of the modern community in \nrelation to education.51   \nSanderson and Wells influenced each others' ideas about education, \nespecially in its relationship to scientific methodology.  The curriculum \nSanderson put into practice at Oundle and advocated elsewhere was \n                                                 \n48Correspondence, IV, pp. 164-66.    \n49See the Outline, p. 664.   \n50'Difficulties arose as the work advanced, and in the end Mr Wells left the task to the staff \nand published his own book.  The composite volume, as was natural, erred on the side of \nhero-worship, whereas Mr Wells's showed, as some think, characteristic lapses from \ngood taste.  Somehow, between them, the real man has got overlaid and Sanderson is on \nhis way to becoming a legendary figure.'

He shared with Wells an ideal of the liberal education as \nfostering a productive synthesis between arts and sciences, permitting \nindividual pupils to specialise in the areas which would best fulfil their \nindividual potential.   \nScience is essentially creative and co-operative, its outlook is \nonwards towards change, it means searching for the truth, it \ndemands research and experiment, and does not rest on authority.  \nUnder this new spirit all history, literature and art and even \nlanguages should be rewritten. (Sanderson's final lecture, reprinted \nin Schoolmaster, Works, XXIV, p. 424) \nUnusually, Sanderson saw his charges as future leaders in the worlds of \nscience, engineering and industry as well as the more traditional routes for \npublic-school-educated boys.  He encouraged them to work collaboratively \non vocational projects that interested them outside of the classroom, seeing \nthis as a microcosm of the collective effort necessary to improve the world in \nthe future.  For Sanderson, as for Wells, the purpose of education was as the \n'propaganda of reconstruction' (XXIV, p. 382), aimed towards the creation of a \nbetter world; in Wells's account: \nHe saw the modern teacher in university and school plainly for \nwhat he has to be, the anticipator, the planner and the foundation-\nmaker of the new and greater order of human life that arises now \nvividly amidst the decaying substructures of the old. (XXIV, p. 316) \nWells ruefully notes, however, that Sanderson's successor as headmaster is \nonly barely aware of the spirit motivating his predecessor's reforms, and that \nmuch valuable work might be lost.53  Until such projects can be made \nuniversal and collective, Wells's desired utopian future will never come into \nbeing.   \n                                                 \n52F.W.

Watson Bain, ed., The Modern Teacher: \nEssays on Educational Aims and Methods (London: Methuen, 1921), pp. 139-72; Sanderson of \nOundle (London: Chatto, 1923). \n53Wells may have been unduly pessimistic about the consolidation of Sanderson's work \nundertaken by Dr Kenneth Fisher, who had been a science master at Eton and Clifton \nCollege, and the manager of a munitions factory.  On Sanderson's legacy, see Walker, pp. \n476-580 and Raymond Flower, Oundle and the English Public School (London: Stacey, 1989), \npp. 89-108.    \n 18\n H.G. Wells, as in so many areas, anticipated his time in the theory and \nmethods of education.  Seeing that a well-organised educational system is \ninseparably a part of the ideological apparatus of the State, he seized this on \neducation reform as an opportunity to found a better State.54 Though Wells's \nplanned future was essentially anti-democratic, envisioning the rulers of the \nfuture state as a meritocratic elite, this process was to be collaborative and \nconsensual: 'education is the state explaining itself to and incorporating the \nwill of the individual' (Joan and Peter, XXIV, p. 262).  Wells was at his most \nemphatic about what should be taught to the most promising students, \narguing that since the World State must have a ruling elite, it is imperative \nthat the elite should be well-educated.   \n In her not wholly unfavourable review of Joan and Peter in The Times \nLiterary Supplement, Virginia Woolf reproved Wells for blurring the \nboundaries between fiction and educational polemic: 'He throws off the \ntrammels of fiction as lightly as he would throw off a coat in running a race.'55  \nWells might have riposted that he has to if the 'race' is not to be won by \n'catastrophe' instead.  'Human history is one history and human welfare is \none whole,' Wells had written in the same year as Joan and Peter.  'And a saner \nteaching of history means a better understanding of international problems, a \nsaner national policy, and a happier world.'56  The aims of education, science \nand literary production are also one for Wells: the construction of a better \nfuture.  In his work from The Time Machine to 1945's Mind at the End of Its \nTether, Wells repeatedly presented an artistic vision of the future;57 the future, \nbiologically, is literally embodied in children, who must be educated.  Wells \nhoped that the correct forms of education, and the best possible teaching of \nHistory and Science in particular, would establish the foundations of a \nreformed government of the world in which poverty and war could be \neradicated along with national boundaries.58  'There's really nothing more to \n                                                 \n54Louis Althusser, 'Ideology and the State', in Lenin and Philosophy and Other Essays, trans. by \nBen Brewster (London: NLB, 1971), pp. 123-73 (127). \n55Unsigned review of Joan and Peter in The Times Literary Supplement, in H.G.

In spite of Wells's efforts, the world \nseemed determined to enact George Santayana's proverb that 'those who \ncannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.'60  \n \n \n \n \n1  \n                                                                                                                                           \nBucknell University Press; London and Toronto: Associated University Presses, 1990), \npp. 218-32. \n59Quoted in Norman and Jeanne Mackenzie, The Time Traveller: The Life of H.G.
