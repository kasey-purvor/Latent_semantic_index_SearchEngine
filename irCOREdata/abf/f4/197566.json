When he fell seriously ill, it returned him to the Andamans, its initial concern \nthat he would prove a conduit for knowledge of colonial superiority superseded by the \nhope that he would survive.5 Later on, Mallitte\u2019s photographs of him were copied, and \nwidely published as lithographic engravings. These images are already quite well \nknown, but the insertion of the original photographs into the visual frame now allows \nus for the first time to interrogate some of the slippages that were implied during the \ntransformation of the limited edition photographs into mass-circulated engravings. \nThis paper will show that the photographs are of significance in this respect in three \nways. First, they enable us to examine the underlying violence of colonization. \nSecond, they demonstrate some of the ambiguities around the use of forced convict \nlabour as a means of colonial expansion. Third, they reveal some of the ways in which \nthe pre-colonial Islands and its peoples were constructed and represented both \ndiscursively and visually through the trope of colonial \u2018tropicality\u2019. As such, the \nphotographs and engravings \u2013 together with their associated written texts - constitute \na significant part of the imagined geography of the Andamans as a conceptual space, \nculturally and environmentally distant, different, and distinct from the British \nmetropole, and ready to receive the supposedly civilizing benefits of colonization.6\n \n  \n* \n \nBy the middle of the nineteenth century, having abandoned a disastrous earlier \nattempt at occupation during the 1790s, the government of India began to develop \nplans to colonize the Andaman Islands. Dating from Marco Polo\u2019s travel writing in \n                                                 \n5 Mouat to Beadon, 15 Jan. 1858, cited in \u2018The Andaman Islands: with notes on Barren Island\u2019, \nSelections from the Records of the Government of India (Home Department), no. 25 (Calcutta, Baptist \nMission Press, 1859) (henceforth Selections from the Records), 28-9. Mouat drew on his experience as \nInspector-General of Prisons, comparing \u2018Jack\u2019s bronchitis with that afflicting \u2018Sonthals and all other \nwild tribes \u2026 in the Jails of the Lower Provinces\u2019.  \n6 On tropical visuality, see: David Arnold, The Problem of Nature: environment, culture and European \nexpansion (Oxford, Blackwell, 1996); David Arnold, The Tropics and the Travelling Gaze: India, \nLandscape, and Science, 1800-1856 (Seattle, University of Washington Press, 2006); Felix Driver and \nLuciana Martins, eds, Tropical Visions in an Age of Empire (Chicago, University of Chicago Press, \n2005); Nancy Leys Stepan, Picturing Tropical Nature (London, Reaktion, 2006).  \n 3 \nthe thirteenth century, there was a widespread belief that the inhabitants of the \nAndamans were at best savages and at worse cannibals. From the end of the \neighteenth century, the significance of eastward sea routes through the Bay of Bengal \ngrew. Correspondingly, so did the frequency of Andamanese attacks on distressed \nseamen and passengers. In 1855, commissioner of neighbouring Arakan, Henry \nHopkinson, wrote of his astonishment that the Islands \u2018should be left in the possession \nof a handful of degenerate negroes, degraded in habits and intelligence to a level little \nabove the beasts of the forest with which they dwell.\u20197 Though Governor-General \nCanning had his doubts about the viability and expense of colonization, the \ngovernment of India and the East India Company\u2019s court of directors were broadly in \nfavour of it.8 Their view was strengthened when in 1856 a group of Andamanese \nkilled eight Chinese traders after they went on shore in search of water.9 Magistrate of \nTenasserim J.C. Haughton wrote: \u2018[I]t appears highly discreditable in a civilised \nGovernment to allow such a state of things to exist within a sea, one may say, \nbounded by its own territories and on the high road to many of its chief emporia.\u201910\n \n  \nIn this broader Bay of Bengal context, the north Indian mainland erupted in \nrebellion in 1857. During widespread military and civilian unrest, rebels damaged or \ndestroyed dozens of prisons, and set free thousands of prisoners, leaving a severe \nshortage of secure jail accommodation. Simultaneously, India\u2019s established penal \nsettlements in the Straits (Singapore, Penang, Malacca) and Burma (Arakan and \nTenasserim Provinces) refused to receive mutineers and rebels amongst the usual \nconvicts sentenced to transportation, considering them to be treacherous. At the \nbeginning of 1857, despite concerns about sea routes, the government had been \nsomewhat reticent about re-colonizing the Andamans, fearing a long-term drain on \nfinances. But with few options for the imprisonment or transportation of rebels and \nmutineers, at the end of the year it appointed Indian medical service surgeon and \n                                                 \n7 Henry Hopkinson, Commissioner of Arakan, to Grey, 8 Feb. 1856, cited in M.V.

Mouat to head a committee charged with \nchoosing the best location for a penal colony on the Islands.11\n \n Mouat was \naccompanied to the Andamans by two assistants, Bengal army surgeon G.F. Playfair, \nand a lieutenant of the Indian navy, J.A. Heathcote. The men returned to India with a \nfavourable report for settlement in the spectacular natural harbour of Port Blair on an \nisland now called South Andaman. \nThe colonization of the Andaman Islands was effected in the wake of the \ndevelopment of photography on the Indian mainland, a radically new visual form \nwhich held out the promise of value-free representation. In Camera Indica, visual \nanthropologist Christopher Pinney describes its development in colonial India in \nterms of its \u2018indexicality\u2019. It offered, he claims, superiority over more equivocal signs \nin a place of apparent visual allusion and wonder.12 At the time, contemporaries \nbelieved that photographs provided objective records free from interpretation. Thus, \nthey were an epistemological medium through which \u2018visual facts\u2019 became scientific \nknowledge. The famous photographer Henry Fox Talbot entitled his first book on the \nmedium The Pencil of Nature, suggesting something of his belief that objects \nrepresented themselves through photographs.13 Mallitte, it seems, agreed, entitling his \ncollection of Andamans images \u2018photographic drawings\u2019.14 Photography seemed to \ncreate new boundaries of \u2018visual truth\u2019 and to challenge artistic interpretations of \nobjects and subjects, through a process Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison have \nconceptualized as \u2018mechanical objectivity\u2019.15\n \n \nThough photographers like Fox Talbot and his contemporaries made claims \nabout its \u2018objectivity\u2019 and \u2018scientific neutrality\u2019, photography does not transcend the \nsocial context in which it is produced, circulated, and read. Cultural, economic, and \npolitical forces all determine both the content of photographs and the ways in which \n                                                 \n11 Clare Anderson, The Indian Uprising of 1857-8: prisons, prisoners and rebellion (London, Anthem, \n2007), 107-15.

For another general account of the development of photography in nineteenth-century India, see \nalso John Falconer, \u2018Photography in Nineteenth-Century India\u2019, in C.A.

Such texts include the descriptions \nassociated with individual images, as well as photographic labels, titles, inventories, \nand albums. Photography also existed alongside other visual forms, most notably \nengraved images. Skilled craftspeople copied photographs by making detailed \nincisions on metal or more usually on cheap wooden plates, thus intervening in the \ncontent or representation of photographic objects or subjects. Their engravings were \nthen printed on paper, and used in newspapers, books, and periodicals. The interplay \nbetween photograph, text, and engraving is especially important vis-\u00e0-vis the \nreproduction of mid nineteenth-century photographs, in the years before the \ndevelopment of technologies of mass circulation.  \nThe head of the Andamans Committee, F.J. Mouat, had served previously as \nfirst president of the Photographic Society of Bengal (1856-7).18 It seems that he \nknew Oscar Mallitte, who like Mouat was a surgeon, perhaps from an earlier meeting \nin Paris. Though Mallitte had only recently arrived in Calcutta, Mouat personally \ninvited him to accompany the expedition as a volunteer, thus reflecting his own \ninterest in photography rather than any official desire to record the trip visually. That \nsaid, on the party\u2019s return to Calcutta, the government of India was keen to acquire \nMallitte\u2019s photographs.19\n                                                 \n16 Elizabeth Edwards, Raw Histories: Photographs, Anthropology and Museums (Oxford, Berg, 2001); \nDavid Green, \u2018Veins of Resemblance: Photography and Eugenics\u2019, Oxford Art Journal, 7, 2 (1985), 15; \nJames Ryan, Picturing Empire: Photography and the Visualization of the British Empire (London, \nReaktion, 1997), 19-20.  \n In his subsequent written account of the survey, Adventures \nand Researches Among the Andaman Islanders (1863), Mouat presented a remarkably \ndetailed account of Mallitte\u2019s work. He described Mallitte as a photographer of \n\u2018considerable experience\u2019. \u2018We considered ourselves truly fortunate,\u2019 he wrote, \u2018in \nhaving secured the services of one who was not only an artist of undoubted ability, \nbut whom, during the long hours at sea that might have passed tediously without his \nsociety, we found to be at all times a most pleasant and entertaining companion.\u2019 He \nwent on to note how during a stop in the Burmese port of Moulmein the survey party \n17 Daston and Galison, \u2018The Image\u2019, 111-12, 120 (quote 111).  \n18 See: Journal of the Photographic Society of Bengal, 2 (21 Jan. 1857). \n19 IOR P.188.52 Home (Judicial) 23 Apr. 1858: Beadon to Mouat, 17 Apr. 1858. \n 6 \ntook the opportunity to test its photographic equipment and materials. Mouat wrote \nthat he was reassured that images could be \u2018reproduced with the nicest fidelity and \naccuracy.\u2019 The committee reached the Andamans on 11 December1857 and, \naccording to Mouat, Mallitte proved a \u2018trusty and faithful comrade\u2019, applying himself \n\u2018diligently\u2019 to his photographic work. Mouat noted: \u2018through his unwearied \napplication we were enabled to carry back an invaluable collection of photographic \npictures of the country and people \u2013 the rich and varied scenes of nature, and\u2019 \u2013 he \nadded somewhat exaggeratedly for he was referring to just five images \u2013 \u2018striking \ngroups illustrative of the life and customs of the natives of the Andaman Islands.\u201920 In \n1858, the Andaman Committee was asked to print 50 sets of Mallitte\u2019s images, to \nmount ten of them, and after reserving five sets \u2018for its own use\u2019, to submit the \nremainder to the government of India. Mouat and Mallitte co-ordinated the printing, \nrunning into difficulties with just one of the images, \u2018John Andaman (dressed)\u2019, for its \nnegative plate sustained damage to the collodiun (wet plate).21\n \n  \nOne of the photographs Mouat first described, Mallitte\u2019s image of Saddle Hill \non North Andaman, did not survive the transition from camera to paper, for there is \nno record of it in the archives, despite the \u2018favourable\u2019 atmosphere in which it was \nproduced.22 But other pictures were more successful. Of the photographing of Barren \nIsland, Mouat noted: \u2018We had no sooner landed, than Monsieur Mallitte, struck by the \nremarkable appearance of the great smoking cone in the centre, made preparations to \ntake a photograph of it; and the skill and correctness with which the appearance of \nthat wonderful natural object was rendered, showing exactly the fine dark silvery \nsurface, was rewarded with the warmest appreciation by all who witnessed the perfect \npicture his superior photographic manipulation produced.\u201923\n \n \n                                                 \n20 Frederic J.

In 1793, the East India Company had \nmade an ill-fated attempt to settle the Islands as a penal colony. Just three years later, \nafter disease decimated the convicts and their associated administration, the Company \nabandoned it. At the turn of 1857-8, Mallitte oversaw the careful rearrangement of the \nruins of the former penal site to produce an aesthetically pleasing image, albeit one \nthat revealed also the limitations of his appareil. Mouat wrote: \n \nThe preparations for this took up a great deal of time, the masses of old masonry \nbeing held so tenaciously in the grasp of the strong creepers, and so profusely covered \nwith vegetation, that before we could expose to view these interesting ruins \u2013 for so \nthey appeared to us \u2013 the labour and delay were such as to call into requisition all the \npatience we possessed \u2026 Monsieur Mallitte included as much in his picture as the \naperture of his lens permitted.24\n \n \n(NB remains of old settlement image \u2013 posed figures). \n\u2018Remains of the Old Settlement, Port Cornwallis\u2019. \nMouat, Adventures and Researches, facing p. 100. \n \nI want to focus on Mallitte\u2019s three photographs of an Andamanese man. We do \nnot know his name, though he was photographed as \u2018Andamans John\u2019, and Mouat \ndescribed him as \u2018Andamans Jack\u2019.25 \u2018Jack\u2019s story is quite remarkable, for the \nsurveyors kidnapped him and took him back to Calcutta where they introduced him to \nGovernor-General (later Viceroy) and Lady Canning. In a letter to Queen Victoria, \nLady Canning wrote that he was \u2018gentle and tractable and imitates everything and is \namused at everything from a glass of water upwards\u2019.26 When he fell ill, he was \nreturned to the Andamans to an uncertain fate.27\n\u2018Jack\u2019 was not the first Andamanese to be removed from the Islands, for \nduring the first half of the nineteenth century a few Islanders were picked up adrift at \nsea and taken to mainland Southeast Asia where they were employed as servants. \n \n                                                 \n24 Mouat, Adventures, 111; Selections from the Records (engraving facing p. 6).  \n25 Note that \u2018Jack\u2019 is a common derivative of \u2018John\u2019.  \n26 Queen\u2019s Collection, Windsor Castle RA VIC\/Z 502\/30: letter from Lady Canning, 9 Jan. 1858. \n27 Selections from the Records, 28-9. \n 8 \nApparently, one man even ended up working as a tobacconist in London.28 However, \nhe is by far the best known, and post-colonial historians and anthropologists have \ndiscussed his kidnap in some depth. Their interest in him rather than earlier abductees \ncan be explained in part by Mouat\u2019s detailed and lengthy description of the event, \nwhich as was common at the time was either summarized or reviewed in a range of \nother publications.29 However, also significant was the circulation of a series of \nengravings of \u2018Jack\u2019, which brought a certain representational immediacy to the story. \nPerhaps the best modern account of the kidnap is by David Tomas, who discusses his \nexperiences through a cultural frame. \u2018Jack\u2019 was, Tomas concludes, \u2018raw cultural \nmaterial to be translated into more easily accessible visual and verbal forms.\u2019 There \nwere six sites used to produce this transformation, including: dressing \u2018Jack\u2019 in \nEuropean clothing; allowing him to look at himself in a mirror; fabricating a \nventriloquist\u2019s dummy to render \u2018Jack\u2019 fearsome and so disperse a gathering Bengali \ncrowd; and, taking his anthropometric measurements.30\n \n I want to unpick further \nTomas\u2019 sixth site of cultural transformation: photography. \nMouat described the photographing of \u2018Jack\u2019 twice. In Adventures and \nResearches, he wrote that he had wanted to photograph him naked in order to \nrepresent him as he had been at the moment of his capture (as \u2018a fac simile\u2019), but after \nhis exposure to the modernity of the survey party this was an impossibility and \u2018Jack\u2019 \nhad refused: \u2018[S]o great was the change already produced in him by his new ideas and \nassociations,\u2019 Mouat wrote, \u2018that he seemed utterly shocked at the very thought of \nappearing naked, even before individuals of his own sex.\u2019 Mouat recalled how he had \neventually persuaded him to comply, but it was no \u2018easy matter\u2019, and \u2018not without \nmany earnest remonstrances [sic] against such a display of himself in his natural \nstate.\u2019 The apparent transformation of \u2018Jack\u2019 from savagery to civilization through the \nprocess of photography was also represented through Mouat\u2019s description of his \n                                                 \n28 IOR P.188.67 India (Public) 18 May 1863, no. 25: Mouat to A.

This is probably because as a result of the broken \nnegative described by Mouat it was produced in only limited numbers and so never \ncirculated widely. But the image is also quite different to the others; for in aligning \n\u2018Jack\u2019 with \u2013 literally dressing him in - \u2018civilization\u2019 it situates him directly beyond \nAndamans landscape and culture, and so perhaps opens up fewer representational \npossibilities.  \n \n(NB: One photograph, standing, dressed).  \n\u2018John Andaman\u2019. \nThe Royal Collection \u00a9 2005, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. \n \nApart from his somewhat vague allusion to \u2018Jack\u2019s compliance with and \nrestraint during the photographic process, what is absent from Mouat\u2019s written \naccount is a sense of the underlying violence of the encounter. This emerged more \nclearly when Mouat addressed a meeting of the Ethnological Society of London after \nhis return to Britain, four years later in January 1862. His presentation followed a \n                                                 \n31 Selections from the Records, frontispiece and xi.  \n32 Mouat, Adventures, 284.  \n 10 \ndiscussion of the skeleton of an Andamanese man killed by the survey party, and \npresented by Mouat to the British Museum.33 Mouat talked against the background of \na table top display of stolen objects, in all probability the same set of \u2018implements\u2019 \nand \u2018weapons\u2019 photographed by Mallitte and incorporated into contemporary \nengravings. The Andamans Committee\u2019s destruction of life and appropriation of both \nhuman remains and community property reveal something of the ambiguity of the \nsupposed distinction between \u2018savagery\u2019 and \u2018civilization\u2019. Moreover, in his verbal \naccount of the survey Mouat transformed his earlier textual representation of \u2018Jack\u2019s \n\u2018shock\u2019 at being stripped of clothing for the photograph (as also his \u2018restlessness\u2019)34 \ninto the language of \u2018distress\u2019 and \u2018disruption\u2019. \u2018Jack\u2019s relationship to both the camera \nand to his captors also emerged as deeply coercive. Mouat spoke of how he had \ninterrupted the sitting by running behind the camera \u2018to see what was going on\u2019. \n\u2018[W]e had to keep him at his post by the menace of a stick,\u2019 he said, \u2018he understood \nthat\u2019.35 Mouat alluded also to \u2018Jack\u2019s relationship to his own image, noting that while \nIndians unfamiliar with the medium tried to read photographs by turning them upside \ndown, \u2018Jack\u2019 flipped his picture over to see if his image was also on the back. 36So \ndescribed, the photographing of \u2018Jack\u2019 might be understood as part of what Felix \nDriver and Luciana Martins have described as the \u2018living space of encounter and \nexchange\u2019 \u2013 and contestation - that characterised the production of visual \nknowledge.37\n \n \nMallitte\u2019s \u2018capture\u2019 of \u2018Jack\u2019s photographic likeness represented visually his \nliteral confinement as an interstitial cultural site. The survey party contained him as a \nmeans both of gathering information about the Andamans and of spreading the \nsupposed benefits of civilization to other Islanders. His physical (and photographic) \ncapture began a pattern of kidnapping (and photographing) Andaman Islanders that \n                                                 \n33 Professor Owen, \u2018On the Osteology and Dentition of the Aborigines of the Andaman Islands, and the \nRelations thereby indicated to other Races of Mankind\u2019, Transactions of the Ethnological Society of \nLondon, 2 (1863), 34-43.

Perhaps the first thing to note with respect to the visual representation of \n\u2018Jack\u2019 is the shifting background to two of the photographs. In the first, near-naked \n\u2018Jack\u2019 stands in front of Andamanese cultural objects. In the second, he is dressed in a \nnaval brigade uniform, and leans against what looks like the side of a house: \npresumably Mouat\u2019s Calcutta residence, where we know he stayed.39 This tied his \nbody to the \u2018natural\u2019 and \u2018urban\u2019 environments respectively in particular ways that \nimplied the mutual incompatibility of both his pre-colonial subjectivity and his entry \ninto colonial modernity. Or as Chamber\u2019s Journal noted when Jack\u2019s clothes were \nremoved and he was returned to the Islands after his forced detention in Calcutta: \n\u2018Barbarism and civilization seemed alike to have deserted him.\u201940\n \n  \nBut the reproduction and circulation of engravings of \u2018Jack\u2019 are also hugely \nsignificant in drawing out the significance of early representations of the Andamans \nas what Driver and Martins have called an extended transaction rather than a linear \nvisual projection.41 At the time of Mouat\u2019s survey, though it was possible to make \ncopies of photographs, it was expensive to mass reproduce them in books, newspapers \nor magazines. A few engravings copied from selected photographs were, however, \nprinted shortly after the committee returned to Calcutta. Four images appeared in each \nof the government of India\u2019s printed account of the expedition, Selections from the \nRecords (1859),42 and Mouat\u2019s Adventures and Researches (1863).43\n                                                 \n38 Clare Anderson, \u2018Early Colonial Contact in the Andaman Islands, 1858-64\u2019, paper presented at \nCrime, Governance and the Colonial: forces, continuities and contemporary strategies conference, \nUniversity of London, 4 July 2008.  \n If the \nphotographing of \u2018Jack\u2019 was deeply coercive, underlying the process that transformed \nthe photographs into a range of engravings was an associated visual intervention that \nwas open to colonial discipline of another kind, for engravings were \u2018quasi-\nphotographic\u2019 sources through which craftsmen intervened in the interpretation and \n39 Mouat, Adventures, 284-6. \n40 \u2018A Savage Archipelago\u2019, 290 (my emphasis).  \n41 Driver and Martins, \u2018Views and Visions\u2019.  \n42 Selections from the Records: frontispiece, no title (\u2018John Andaman\u2019); facing p. 6, \u2018Remains of the \nOld Settlement Chatham Island\u2019; facing p. 9, no title (Barren Island); facing p. 22, \u2018Andaman Islanders \nand Implements\u2019.

Within this triage of photograph, engraving, and description lay the \npossibility of visual and textual disruption of various kinds, rendering each potentially \nunstable in content and meaning both as individual images and in relation to each \nother. \nMallitte\u2019s photograph of the Labyrinth Islands and its associated engraving \npresents a fascinating slippage in these respects. When the Andamans Committee \nstopped in Moulmein, the local authorities assigned twelve convicts to their charge; as \nMouat put it \u2018men who, from their previous habits, were accustomed to find their way \nin the dense and tangled forests of these regions\u2019.45 In most of Mallitte\u2019s photographs, \nthe accompanying text is a simple description of the English name given to particular \ngeographical spaces \u2013 \u2018Port Blair\u2019, \u2018Barren Island\u2019, \u2018Port Cornwallis\u2019, and so on - and \nhis image of the convicts \u2013 \u2018One of the Labyrinth Islands, Burmese Convicts\u2019 - is no \nexception. In the engraving of the photograph, however, the convicts underwent a \ntextual transformation, becoming a party of Burmese pioneers. This transformation \ndid not go unnoticed in contemporary reports of the survey. As Chamber\u2019s Journal \nreported, the \u2018convicts\u2019 were placed in Mouat\u2019s service as \u2018pioneers\u2019.46\n \n \n(NB Photograph: Burmese convicts) \n\u2018One of the Labyrinth Islands, Burmese Convicts\u2019. \nThe Royal Collection \u00a9 2005, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. \n \n(NB facing p. 147, \u2018Burmese Pioneers\u2019.) \n\u2018Burmese Pioneers\u2019.  \nMouat, Adventures and Researches, facing p. 147. \n \n                                                 \n44 Paul Jenkins, \u2018The Earliest Generation of Missionary Photographers in West Africa: The Portrayal of \nIndigenous People and Culture\u2019, Visual Anthropology, 7 (1984), 120.  \n45 Mouat, Adventures, 70.  \n46 \u2018A Savage Archipelago\u2019, The Eclectic Magazine (Nov. 1862), 286 (reproduced from Chamber's \nJournal).  \n 13 \nI find this textual shift immensely significant in drawing out some of the \nambivalences of the relationship between penal transportation and colonization, and \nin turn and in a broader sense in bringing out some of the recurrent tensions within the \ncolonial association between the spatial dynamics of confinement and expansion. As \nsuch, this semiotic occlusion is an interesting expression of colonial uncertainties \naround convicts as colonizers, and is part of a broader argument about the \ncontemporary silences that surround the use of convicts in processes of colonization \naround the Bay of Bengal during the first half of the nineteenth century. In turn, this \nsilence expresses the recurrent tension between visibility and invisibility that in the \nwidespread use of both high-walled prisons and outdoor labour to incarcerate \nprisoners and to put them to work gave specificity to colonial penal regimes.47 It \nspeaks perhaps to a certain colonial discomfort about its reliance on forced penal \nlabour, with convict workers rendered invisible within what we might term the liberal \ncolonial fantasy of the \u2018abolition\u2019 of \u2018slavery\u2019 and its replacement with other forms of \nlabour, whether apprenticed, indentured or \u2018free\u2019.48\n \n \nAnd what of the engraved images of \u2018Jack\u2019 that were copied from Mallitte\u2019s \nphotographs? It is clear that he underwent further representational shifts during the \nprocess of transformation from photograph to engraving. As a \u2018specimen\u2019 of an entire \ncommunity, photographed in Calcutta \u2018Jack\u2019 stands before a spread of social anchors, \nincluding bows, nets, and other \u2018implements and weapons\u2019 stolen by the survey party. \nWhen this print was line-drawn \u2013 it was the frontispiece to the government of India\u2019s \nSelections from the Records - these cultural artefacts were replaced with a more \nnaturalistic backdrop of palm trees and \u2018exotic\u2019 foliage. Of interest in this respect too \nis the frontispiece to Mouat\u2019s Adventures and Researches \u2013 \u2018A Group of Andaman \nIslanders\u2019 - in which a man clearly drawn from photographs of \u2018Jack\u2019 appears in front \nof other Islanders, a campfire, a man firing a bow, and a canoe out at sea in the \ndistance. Another such incorporative engraving by the well known contemporary \nartist Colesworthy Grant portrays two men drawing arrows in a canoe surrounded by \n                                                 \n47 Clare Anderson and David Arnold, \u2018Envisioning the Colonial Prison\u2019 in Frank Dik\u00f6tter and Ian \nBrown, eds, Cultures of Confinement: a history of the prison in Africa, Asia and Latin America \n(London, Christopher Hurst, 2007), 304-31.  \n48 Cf Indrani Chatterjee and Richard M.

I assume that this is the \nportrait Mouat claimed been drawn by Colesworthy Grant, who had drawn the \nincorporative image of \u2018Islanders and implements\u2019. Mouat claimed Grant\u2019s portrait of \n\u2018Jack\u2019 as a faithful and accurate rendering of his \u2018mild, gentle, and benevolent\u2019 \nexpression, and chose it to illustrate the title page of his Adventures and Researches.50 \nIt also appeared in popular periodicals like Harper\u2019s Weekly and the Illustrated \nLondon News during 1858.51\n \n Perhaps the appeal of Grant\u2019s portrait lay in its \nexpression of a passivity that contrasted with the common trope of cannibal savagery, \nbut it also revealed a three-fold juxtaposition disavowed by each of Mallitte\u2019s \nphotographs: of pre-modernity (\u2018Jack\u2019), civilization (his naval uniform), and \ncolonialism (the large and high-backed wicker chair found commonly in the \n\u2018tropics\u2019). Thus the image constituted visually a tropicality that positioned \u2018Jack\u2019 \u2013 \nand by implication all Andamanese \u2013 as children of nature anticipating colonization. \n(NB Book\u2019s Title page). \n\u2018Adventures and Researches Among the Andaman Islanders\u2019. \nMouat, Adventures and Researches. \n \nOnly one of the photographic images of \u2018Jack\u2019 has no backdrop, and this was \nthe case for its copy too.

His head is \nturned slightly to one side to reveal the shape of his nose and head, as also an \nexpression of discomfort if not deep unease. With no cultural anchors or other visual \ninterventions of any kind, this image rendered \u2018Jack\u2019 a specimen whose cranial and \nupper bodily form could be generalized to the social and cultural classification of the \ndiverse populations of the archipelago. As such, this image might be seen as a \nprecursor to the later anthropometric work of colonial officers E.H. Man and M.V. \nPortman. These were investigations of the \u2018racial\u2019 origins of an isolated community \nthat were of enormous interest to a range of scientists later on during the nineteenth \ncentury.53 Indeed, Mouat sent the photographs of \u2018John Andaman\u2019 to German \nscientist Baron Alexander von Humboldt together with his anthropometric \nmeasurements.54 Mouat reported that Humboldt had used the images to confirm his \n\u2018racial type\u2019.55\n \n \n(one photograph, sitting, torso\/ head shot, wearing trousers). \n\u2018John Andaman\u2019. \nThe Royal Collection \u00a9 2005, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. \n \n* \n \n                                                 \n52 I bought the engraving drawn from this photograph - \u2018A native of the Andaman Islands\u2019 - on e-Bay \nin 2007. Though it is clearly taken from a newspaper or periodical and is a direct copy from Mallitte\u2019s \nphotograph of \u2018Jack\u2019s head and torso, I am unsure of its provenance and I have been unable to trace its \npublication.  \n53 Most famous during the early years of settlement is Owen, \u2018On the Osteology and Dentition of the \nAborigines\u2019. A small selection of later nineteenth-century literature includes: G.E. Dobson, \u2018On the \nAndamans and Andamanese\u2019, Journal of the Anthropological Institute, 4 (1875), 457-67; W.H.

After his trip to the Andamans, Mallitte \nfound employment as photographer to Viceroy Lord Canning\u2019s official tour of the \nNorthwest Provinces during 1859. Later, he taught at the School of Industrial Arts in \nCalcutta, setting up his own studio in the city. During the 1870s, Mallitte\u2019s attention \nturned back to the Andamans, and he became involved in the experimental \nphotography of convicts transported from the Bengal Presidency to the Islands in \n1874. The photographs were supposed to be read alongside descriptive records to \nfacilitate identification in case of escape. The photographic trial failed, however, for it \ndid not prove possible to individuate convicts from communities that were most \nusually regarded through the collective lens of \u2018caste\u2019.56\n \n But Mallitte\u2019s images of \n\u2018Jack\u2019 proved successful for the same reason his convict images did not: their \npresentation of an individual as a collective representation of an imagined community.  \nMallitte\u2019s images of the Andaman Islands failed to produce what Joseph \nMullins referred to at the Photographic Society of Bengal as \u2018stern fidelity\u2019,57\n                                                 \n56 National Archives of India Home (Port Blair) A proceedings, Feb. 1876, 5-13: Photographing \nConvicts. See also Anderson, Legible Bodies, 145-59.  \n but they \ndid offer the possibility of significant innovations with respect to associated forms of \nvisual and textual representation. In the years before the mass production of \nphotographs, engravings copied from Mallitte\u2019s prints made sense of unsettling \naspects of colonial settlement and expansion as also the social and cultural meaning of \nindigeneity. In association with a range of descriptive text, the images produced \nmeaning around the violence of colonization, the ambiguities of civilization through \nthe savagery of forced labour, and the management of the natural and cultural \nenvironment with the construction of what we might term \u2018the tropical gaze\u2019. \nMallitte\u2019s photographs and their visual and textual associations thus reveal \ncolonization as a sphere of coercion enveloping multiple representational overlaps. \n57 Reverend Joseph Mullins, cited in Pinney, Camera Indica, 20.  \n"}
