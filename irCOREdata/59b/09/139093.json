We extend the predominantly US based literature in a number of\nimportant ways. Firstly, a comparative analysis of the UK and US legal and institutional settings\nleads us to hypothesize that UK boards will play a weaker monitoring role and hence board\nstructures will not be determined by monitoring related factors. Our evidence supports this\nconjecture, showing that board structure determinants differ in predictable ways across different\ninstitutional settings. Secondly, in contrast to recent US mandatory reforms, UK reforms have\nbeen voluntary. As such they provide an interesting comparison, being arguably more effective\nthan a mandatory approach by allowing firms to choose board structures most appropriate for\ntheir own needs. Our results support this point of view. Although the UK reforms do have a\nsignificant impact on board structures, a large number of firms choose not to comply, and those\nthat do appear to do so for strong economic reasons. The reforms also appear to reduce the\nability of well performing CEOs to influence board structures.\nJEL classification: G32, G34\nKeywords: Board size; Board composition; UK; US; Corporate governance; Cadbury; Hampel\n11. Introduction\nBoards of directors play a central and fundamentally important role in the corporate\ngovernance of publicly listed companies, and therefore understanding the determinants of board\nstructure is an important research question. Recently, our understanding has increased following\ntheoretical (e.g., Raheja, 2005; Adams and Ferreira, 2007; Harris and Raviv, 2006) and\nempirical work (e.g., Coles et al., 2006; Boone et al., 2007; Lehn et al., 2003; Linck et al.,\n2007a; Linck et al., 2007b). The latter (reviewed in Section 2 below) has examined board\nstructure in terms of long term trends, firm specific determinants, and regulatory impacts.\nDespite these recent advances, theoretical papers have mostly been grounded in a US setting\n(for an exception, see Adams and Ferreira (2007)) and empirical studies have focused mainly on\nUS firms. The few non-US empirical studies employ either relatively small or cross-sectional\nsamples. We consequently have little knowledge of how trends and determinants of board\nstructure differ in countries with different legal, institutional and regulatory systems. However,\nboard functions and their effectiveness may differ according to these characteristics, and so\nconsequently may the trends and determinants of board structure. Examination of other countries\nis therefore useful in developing a broader view of what determines board structure. This paper\ncontributes to the US based literature by examining the trends and determinants of board\nstructure for a large sample of UK firms over a long time period (1981-2002).\nThe UK provides a particularly interesting setting for this purpose. The US and UK\ngovernance systems share many similarities, such as a common law system and high protection\nof minority rights (La Porta et al., 1998), and the international comparative governance literature\nhas tended to combine their features into a single \u2018Anglo-American\u2019 market-based system.\nHowever, there are also important differences, including the enforcement of directors\u2019 legal\nduties, board structure, the role of institutional investors, and the nature of corporate governance\nreforms, which lead us to hypothesize that UK boards will play a much weaker monitoring role.\nHence board structure will not be determined by the costs or benefits of monitoring, and\ntherefore board structure determinants will differ in a predictable way from US firms. Our\n2evidence supports this prediction. Although we find, consistent with US studies, that board size\nand the proportion of outsiders is positively impacted by greater advising needs, and negatively\nimpacted by CEO influence, we find no evidence that the proportion of outsiders is negatively\nrelated to monitoring costs or positively related to monitoring benefits.\nThe UK trends in board structure over the sample period provide an interesting comparison\nwith US trends, allowing us to distinguish between country specific and more general trends,\nand thus contribute to the convergence debate regarding whether corporate governance models\n(even within the Anglo-American model) are converging (e.g., Gilson, 2001). We find a steady\nincrease in the number and proportion of outsiders over the sample period, and evidence of a\ndecline in the number of insiders and overall board size since the late 1980s. Overall, this is\nbroadly consistent with US trends, and suggests that similar forces are at work in both countries.\nAlthough carried out for similar reasons, UK and US corporate governance regulations differ\nmarkedly. In contrast to the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOA) which is mandatory, UK reforms\nhave been voluntary and operate on a comply-or-explain basis. Such \u2018soft\u2019 regulation is arguably\nmore effective than a mandated \u2018one size fits all\u2019 approach, allowing firms to choose the board\nstructure most appropriate for their own needs without weakening underlying economic\ndeterminants. Recent calls in the US have argued for a scaling back of SOA towards a less\nmandated approach (Romano, 2005). Hence, examination of UK reform permits an interesting\ncomparison with the impact of SOA. We examine the impact of the key board structure reforms\nover the sample period, the Cadbury Report (1992) (which recommended that boards include at\nleast three outside directors) and the Hampel Report (1998) (which recommended that boards\ninclude at least one third outside directors).1 The Cadbury Report is associated with an increase\nin the number and proportion of outsiders, whilst the Hampel Report has no significant impact\non either. The flexibility offered by such regulation appears to be valued by companies, since a\nlarge number of firms do not comply, and many more comply irregularly. Furthermore,\ncompliance is associated with the normal determinants of board structure. The reforms do not\n3fundamentally change the underlying determinants of board structure, except for the negative\nrelation between firm performance and outsider proportion which subsequently no longer holds,\npossibly reflecting a reduced ability of well performing CEOs to influence board structures.\nThe paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 reviews the US empirical literature on determinants\nand trends in board structure. Section 3 compares the functions of boards of directors in the UK\nand US. Section 4 describes the data. Section 5 presents long run board structure trends.\nSections 6 and 7 present the empirical results on the determinants of board structure and the\nimpact of the corporate governance reforms, respectively. Section 8 concludes.\n2. The determinants of board structure: The US evidence\nThe main findings of the extant US empirical literature on board structure determinants are\nreported in Table 1 below. The explanatory variables are related to explanations based on either\nefficiency or power. To consider efficiency explanations, studies consider the two main\nfunctions of the board, advising and monitoring (Raheja, 2005; Adams and Ferreira, 2007), and\nwhich firm specific characteristics will result in these functions creating value.\nINSERT TABLE 1 HERE\nThe board\u2019s advisory role is to provide the CEO with advice and access to information and\nresources, and is more efficiently carried out by outside directors who can provide important\nconnections and expertise (Fama and Jensen, 1983). A larger board and proportion of outsiders\ncan provide greater information and hence both should increase as the requirement for advice\nincreases. This should occur as firm scale and complexity increases (Lehn et al., 2003). Most\nempirical studies find that board size and outsider proportion are positively related to firm size\nand complexity, the latter measured by age, leverage, or industrial diversification.\nThe monitoring role involves ensuring that senior management pursues shareholder interests.\nOutsider directors are more likely to be independent and objective in this task than insider\ndirectors, since they wish to signal their competence to other potential employers and frequently\nalready have monitoring experience (Fama and Jensen, 1983). In contrast, insiders\u2019 are less\n1 The Higgs Report (2003), which lies beyond our sample period, subsequently recommended that boards should\n4independent because their careers within the firm are dependent on the CEO (Zajac and\nWestphal, 1994). Monitoring is more efficient with a larger board and proportion of outsiders\nbecause of greater shared information (Lehn et al., 2003), although there are eventually\ncoordination and free rider problems with larger boards (Jensen, 1993; Yermack, 1996). It is\nargued that as the benefits (costs) of monitoring increase, boards will do more (less) monitoring\nleading to more (less) outsiders and larger (smaller) boards (Raheja, 2005). Monitoring benefits\nare high when management can benefit at shareholders expense and monitoring costs are high\nwhen outside directors face high information asymmetry. Table 1 shows that evidence is mixed\non whether board size and outsider proportion are positively related to proxies (cash flow and\nindustry concentration) for monitoring benefits. Proxies employed for monitoring costs (stock\nvolatility and firm growth (proxied by high Tobin's Q and R&D)) all have a negative impact on\nboard size, although only Tobin's Q has a consistently negative impact on outsider proportion.\nAn alternative theory of board structure is that it is determined by CEO power, whereby more\npowerful CEOs bargain with outside directors for a smaller board with fewer outsiders\n(Hermalin and Weisbach, 1998). The evidence in Table 1 supports this theory, since the proxies\nfor CEO influence, past profitability and CEO ownership, both have a negative impact on board\nsize and the proportion of outsiders.\nRecent US empirical studies document notable long term trends in board structure. 1985-\n2000 witnessed a decline in board size for large firms and an increase in outsider proportion for\nlarge and median firms (Lehn et al., 2003; Linck et al., 2007a). However, from 2000 onwards,\nthe period preceding and following SOA, board size and outsider proportion increase for all firm\nsizes (Linck et al., 2007a; Linck et al., 2007b). Linck et al., (2007a) find that the link between\nCEO ownership and both board size and outsider proportion is no longer negative following\nSOA, implying that CEO influence on board structure is diminished by SOA.2\ncomprise at least one half outside directors.\n2 It is not clear however that this represents more efficient boards since CEO influence could be a reward for\nsuperior ability and lead to a value maximising outcome (Hermalin and Weisbach, 1988).\n53. Will the same factors determine US and UK board structures? A comparison of board\nfunctions and their effectiveness in the US and UK\nThe prescribed function of boards and outside directors in the UK is very similar to that in the\nUS. UK boards are of a unitary structure, and, \u201cthe responsibilities of the board include setting\nthe company\u2019s strategic aims, providing the leadership to put them into effect, supervising the\nmanagement of the business and reporting to shareholders on their stewardship.\u201d (Cadbury,\n1992, p. 14). The role of outside directors is to \u201csupport executives in their leadership of the\nbusiness and to monitor and supervise their conduct\u201d (Higgs, 2003, p. 28). Specific areas for\nmonitoring include integrity of financial information, risk management, executive remuneration,\nand the appointment and removal of executive directors (Financial Reporting Council, 2006).\nHowever, despite these similarities, there are several reasons why the monitoring function\nwill be carried out less effectively in the UK. Firstly, whilst under UK company law, directors\nhave a duty of care and of loyalty (Financial Reporting Council, 2006) as they do in the US,\nlegal procedural differences mean that whilst law suits against outside directors are frequent in\nthe US, they are very rare in the UK (Franks et al., 2001; Black et al., 2005).3 Since UK outside\ndirectors are rarely held legally accountable for failing to fulfill their duties, they regard their\nrole as being primarily that of advising rather than monitoring (e.g., Franks et al., 2001; Ozkan,\n2007). Secondly, UK boards have historically consisted of a lower proportion of outside\ndirectors who are less independent from management (e.g., Cosh and Hughes, 1987). Although\nthe Cadbury (1992) and Hampel (1998) Reports encouraged an increase in the number of\noutside independent directors, it is still relatively low and outside director independence is still\nweak due to an overly informal appointment process (Higgs, 2003). Further, the UK corporate\ngovernance culture could arguably be perceived as having a lower predisposition to monitoring,\nillustrated by substantial resistance to the reforms and the Hampel Committee\u2019s claim that past\ngovernance debates had \u2018overemphasized\u2019 monitoring (Davies, 2001). Thirdly, the financial\nincentives for outside directors to fulfill their functions effectively are relatively lower in the\n6UK. Outside directors own a relatively low number of shares (Cosh and Hughes, 1987) and\noutside director pay is also relatively low with insufficient pay being cited as a barrier to non-\nexecutive effectiveness (Higgs, 2003).4 One board characteristic which may offset to some\nextent the weaker monitoring of UK boards is the division of the CEO and Chairman roles.\nAlthough the roles were historically combined (as in the US) (Cosh and Hughes, 1997), the\nCadbury Report (1992) recommended their division and this now occurs in 90% of UK firms in\ncontrast to only 19% of US firms (Higgs, 2003). Other board characteristics such as board size\nand outsider director personal characteristics (age, years with company, number of other\ndirectorships) are similar between the US and UK (Cosh and Hughes, 1987).\nThe monitoring role played by outside directors will depend on the relative strength of other\nsubstitute governance mechanisms (Agrawal and Knoeber, 1996). Firstly, although both\ncountries have active markets for corporate control with a relatively high proportion of hostile\ntakeovers, UK companies have many less takeover defences available to them and consequently\nthis mechanism should perform a relatively stronger function in the UK (Short and Keasey,\n1999). Secondly, whilst dispersed share ownership is the norm in both countries, ownership\nconcentration is higher in the UK (Short and Keasey, 1999) and is predominated by pension\nfunds and insurance companies, who arguably exhibit a longer time-frame in their investment\nstrategies than mutual funds which predominate in the US. British institutional investors have\nbeen encouraged to monitor by both the Cadbury (1992) and Myners (2001) Reports, and appear\nto do so by acting collectively (Crespi-Cladera and Renneboog, 2003) and exerting a \u2018quiet\ndiplomacy\u2019 on issues such as strategy, succession, and executive remuneration (Black and\nCoffee, 1994; Holland, 1998). In contrast, such behaviour is discouraged by US securities laws,\n3 Although the out-of-pocket liability of US outside directors is low, law suits still impose considerable costs\n(Black et al., 2005).\n4 Regarding insiders, US CEOs are paid more and have a slightly higher proportion of shares than UK CEOs\n(Conyon and Murphy, 2000). For the board as a whole, Short and Keasey (1999) report a UK mean board\nownership of 12% which is lower than the 21% owned by officers and outside directors reported for the US by\nLinck et al. (2007a).\n7and US investors do not tend to communicate directly with the CEO. The stronger monitoring\nby these other mechanisms in the UK will likely result in lower monitoring by outside directors.5\nIn summary, UK boards are expected to play a weaker monitoring role than US boards. This\nview is supported by UK evidence on the impact of outside directors, with no positive impact on\neither general firm performance (see e.g., Vafeas and Theodorou, 1998) or specific monitoring\ntasks (Cosh and Hughes, 1997; Franks et al., 2001).6 In contrast, the US empirical literature\n(reviewed by Hermalin and Weisbach, 2003) shows outsider proportion to have a positive\nimpact on specific tasks (although no effect on overall performance). Consequently, in contrast\nto US findings, we do not expect board structure to be linked to the costs and benefits of\nmonitoring. However, we do expect variables associated with advisory needs and CEO influence\nto have similar impacts to those for US studies. The small number of existing UK studies, the\nkey findings of which are reported in Table 1, provide support for this argument.\n4. Data\n4.1. Sample\nThe data source for our sample of UK publicly quoted firms is Datastream, from which all\nvariables are derived. Datastream reports the total number of directors and the number of non-\nexecutive directors. In the UK, non-executive directors are part-time directors, whilst executive\ndirectors are employed full time and are involved in the day to day running of the company in\naddition to their director\u2019s duties. Henceforth, we refer to non-executive directors as outside\ndirectors, and to executive directors as inside directors. We focus on two board measures; the\ntotal number of directors (Board size), and the proportion of outsiders (%Outsiders). The latter is\nestimated by the number of outside directors divided by the total number of directors. There is\nno electronic data source to classify UK directors more finely in terms of independence, or other\nboard structure variables such as whether the CEO is also chairman.\n5 This is illustrated by the events following the Carlton\u2013Granada merger, where institutions removed CEO Michael\nGreen and criticized the inaction of outside directors, threatening them with removal (Kirkbride and Letza, 2005).\n6 However, increasing outside directors post-Cadbury did result in more effective CEO turnover (Dahya et al.,\n2002), CEO appointments (Dahya and McConnell, 2005), and firm performance (Dahya and McConnell, 2007).\n8Firm reporting on board size and composition is very low until the late 1970s. Coverage then\nincreases over time, but significantly more slowly for the number of outside directors (and hence\n%Outsiders) than board size. Board size observations are available for less than 10% of\nDatastream firms in 1978 and 1979, roughly 50% in 1980, and 84% in 1981. In contrast,\nobservations on the number of outside directors (and hence %Outsiders) increases only\ngradually from 7% in 1980 to 86% in 1992.7 We base our empirical analysis on 1981 onwards\nsince this year marks the start of high Datastream coverage on board size. Table 2 below reports\nthe number of Datastream firms along with the availability of board size and the number of\noutside directors, from 1981 onwards. Over the first ten years of our sample period, there is\nconsequently incomplete coverage on board composition and a larger sample available to\nexamine board size. The incomplete coverage on board composition causes potential problems\nfor the analysis of both trends and determinants, and we address these in subsequent tests below.\nINSERT TABLE 2 HERE\nFor the analysis of board structure trends (Section 5), the samples employed include all the\nfirm year observations available on each board structure measure, as reported in Columns (2)\nand (5) of Table 2. For the analysis of board structure determinants (Section 6), the samples\nemployed also depend on the availability of other explanatory variables, which we now describe.\n4.2. Variable specification\nThe explanatory variables we use to test the hypotheses about firm size, firm complexity,\nprivate benefits, monitoring costs, and CEO influence described in Section 2 are as follows. Our\nmeasure of firm size, Size, is the logarithm of the market value of equity adjusted for inflation\n(deflated using the UK Retail Price Index and expressed in 2002 sterling). To proxy for firm\ncomplexity, we include firm age and financial leverage. Age is the logarithm of the number of\nyears since the firm is first listed on Datastream. Debt is the sum of long term debt, short term\ndebt and preference capital, divided by the sum of shareholder funds, long term debt, short term\ndebt and preference capital. To proxy for monitoring costs we use three variables. Our two\n7 Using a logit analysis we find that, prior to 1988, firms which report the number of outsiders are larger, younger,\n9growth measures are Tobin\u2019s Q, which is book value of total assets plus market value of equity\nminus book value of equity divided by book value of total assets, and R&D, which is research\nand development expenditure (if missing set to zero) divided by sales. Our information\nasymmetry measure is STDDEV, which is the standard deviation of monthly stock returns over\nthe 12 months preceding the financial year end. To proxy for managers\u2019 potential private\nbenefits we include measures for free cash flow and industry concentration. Free cash flow,\nFCF, is cash holdings divided by total assets. Industry concentration, Concentration, is\ncalculated as the sum of all the squared market shares, where market share for each firm is firm\nsales divided by total sales for the industry, and industry is defined using Datastream Level 4\nindustry groupings. We proxy for CEO influence (based on perceived ability) using operating\nperformance, ROA, measured as the ratio of operating profit before depreciation and provisions\ndivided by total assets.8 All variables are winsorized at the 1st and 99th percentiles to remove\ninfluential outliers.\nFor our main analysis we require the availability of all the above variables. We exclude\nfinancial and real estate firms (Datastream Level 4 Industries 80-89), due to the specific\ncharacteristics of financial ratios in these industries. Firm year observations for which these\nvariables are available along with board size or board composition are reported in Columns (5)\nand (8) of Table 2, respectively. Our final samples consist of unbalanced panel datasets of 2,746\nunique firms with 25,668 firm year observations for board size tests and 2,515 unique firms with\n19,307 firm year observations for board composition tests.\nTable 3 below presents summary statistics for the variables employed. The average (median)\nboard size is 7.18 (7), whilst the average (median) proportion of outside directors is 0.41 (0.40).\nBoard size is thus similar to that reported for US studies, whilst the proportion of outsiders is\nmuch smaller. For example, Linck et al. (2007a) report an average of 7.5 for board size and an\naverage of 0.66 for the proportion of outsiders.\nhave lower Tobin's Q and cash holdings, and higher return variance and profitability, than non-reporting firms.\n8 Industrial diversification and board ownership are also potentially important board structure determinants.\nBecause they are only partly available for our sample period, we test for their impacts in additional tests below.\n10\nINSERT TABLE 3 HERE\n5. Long term trends in board structure\nIn this section we examine long run trends in UK board structure from 1981-2002. For both\nboard size and composition trends, we use all available firm year observations from Columns (3)\nand (6) of Table 2, respectively. Figures 1A, 1B, 1C, and 1D below exhibit the trends in board\nsize, outsider proportion, number of outsiders, and number of insiders, respectively. Since\nDatastream reporting on the number of outsiders (and hence outsider proportion and number of\ninsiders) expands considerably up to 1988, aggregating all observations into a time series prior\nto then is problematic. The sample composition changes are large and firms for which this\nmeasure is reported for the first time have a lower proportion of outsiders, number of outsiders,\nand number of insiders than firms for which it is already reported. Therefore to examine trends\nprior to 1988, in each year prior to 1988 we sample the firms with the number of outsiders\navailable, and report their subsequent trend without including any new firms. The faint lines in\nFigures 1B, 1C and 1D exhibit trends for such firms sampled in 1981 and 1985.9 In contrast, the\nbold lines exhibit trends from 1988 onwards, using all observations.\nINSERT FIGURE 1 HERE\nFigure 1A shows that average board size increases in the 1980s and then declines in the\n1990s, especially after 2000. The negative change in board size over the entire period is\nstatistically significant, and consistent with the decline in the US, suggesting common factors\nmay be at work. However, there are differences. Firstly, US board sizes decreased from 1980\nonwards. Secondly, the decline in the US is only applicable to large firms (Linck et al., 2007a),\nwhilst we find a decline for small, medium and large firms.10 Finally, whilst US boards increase\nin size immediately preceding and following SOA, there is no evidence of an increase\nsurrounding either the Cadbury (1992) or Hampel (1998) Reports.\nFigure 1B shows that the proportion of outside directors increases steadily over the entire\nsample period. The increase is statistically significant, and consistent with US trends (Lehn et\n9 Identical results are found when we repeat the analysis using 1982, 1983, 1984, 1986, 1987 and 1988 instead.\n11\nal., 2003; Linck et al., 2007a). We find a similar increase in outsider proportion for small,\nmedium and large firms. Outside director representation is clearly increasing many years prior to\nthe Cadbury (1992) and Hampel (1998) Reports.\nFigures 1C and 1D show the average number of outsiders and insiders on the board,\nrespectively. The number of outsiders increases significantly from 1981 onwards. For firms with\n1981 data, there is an increase from 3.10 in 1981 to 4.69 in 2002. Consequently, the proportion\nof firms that meet the Cadbury requirement of having at least three outside directors\nsignificantly increases over the period, both prior to 1988 for the smaller samples and from 1988\nonwards for all firms (from 44% in 1988 to 70% in 2002). The average number of inside\ndirectors is constant until 1988, then falls from 5 to 3.5 in 2002. These trends help us to\nunderstand board size trends. From 1981-88, the number of outsiders increases whilst insiders\nare constant, hence board size increases. From 1988 onwards, the increase in the number of\noutsiders is offset by a larger decline in the number of insiders, hence board size declines.\nThe trends we have documented are based on much longer term and broader sample evidence\nthan previous UK studies, which have not examined trends prior to the 1990s. Our evidence is\nhowever consistent with the questionnaire evidence of the Bank of England (1983; 1985; 1988),\nwhich shows that outsiders grew in importance in the 1970s and 1980s. These earlier trends can\nbe traced to pressure from various institutions which emphasized the monitoring role of outside\ndirectors (Bullock, 1977; Department of Trade and Industry, 1977; Institute of Directors, 1982;\nAssociation of British Insurers, 1990). Their recommendations can be seen as forerunners to the\nCadbury and Hampel Reports (Kirkbride and Letza, 2005) and in considering the impact of\nthese reforms it is clearly important to examine the extent to which any changes are simply\ncontinuations of these previous trends. We return to this issue in Section 7 below.\n6. The determinants of board structure: Econometric analysis\nIn this section we report the results of multivariate regressions which test the determinants of\nboard structure. Such tests present several econometric problems such as independence of\n10 Small, medium, and large firms are those in the lowest, middle three, and highest quintiles of Datastream firms\n12\nobservations, measurement error in the proxy variables and endogeneity (Boone et al., 2007;\nLinck et al., 2007a) which our econometric approach and robustness tests attempt to address.\n6.1. Econometric approach\nOur primary approach is to employ the entire panel dataset described in Table 2, which\nallows us to exploit both the cross-section and time series nature of the data. Although panel\ndata analysis has several significant advantages over cross-sectional analysis, the independence\nof the year-to-year firm-level observations is a concern because board structure is relatively\npersistent (Hermalin and Weisbach, 1988). To illustrate this, the sample correlation between\nboard size (%Outsiders) and its one year lag is 0.8839 (0.7696). To control for this serial\ncorrelation, we estimate robust Huber-White standard errors in which observations are clustered\nat the firm level. Potential measurement error in the proxy variables can lead to attenuation bias\nwhere reported results are understated, and we therefore follow Boone et al. (2007) and Linck et\nal. (2007a) and use multiple proxies for single hypotheses (complexity, monitoring costs and\nmonitoring benefits), as described in Section 4.2. Endogeneity problems can occur if board\nstructure and firm specific measures are jointly determined by unobservable factors (unobserved\nheterogeneity), or if board structure impacts firm specific measures rather than vice versa. In\norder to reduce endogeneity problems we use industry dummy variables (defined with\nDatastream Level 4 industry groupings) to control for industry effects (Mulherin, 2005), and\nyear dummy variables to control for board structure trends. We return to these issues in more\ndetail below. Our initial regression specifications for board size and composition are as follows:\nBoardsize = \u03b1 + \u03b21 Size + \u03b22 Debt + \u03b23 Age + \u03b24 Tobin\u2019s Q + \u03b25 R&D + \u03b26 STDDEV + \u03b27 FCF\n+ \u03b28 Concentration + \u03b29 ROA + IndustryDummies + YearDummies + \u03b5 (1)\n%Outsiders = \u03b1 + \u03b21 Size + \u03b22 Debt + \u03b23 Age + \u03b24 Tobin\u2019s Q + \u03b25 R&D + \u03b26 STDDEV + \u03b27\nFCF + \u03b28 Concentration + \u03b29 ROA + IndustryDummies + YearDummies + \u03b5 (2)\n6.2. Key results\nranked annually on market values.\n13\nThe results for Equations (1)-(2) are reported in Columns (1) and (3) of Table 4 below. Firm\nsize is significantly positive in both regressions, providing strong support for the hypothesis that\nlarger firms have larger boards and a higher proportion of outside directors. In the board size\nregression, firm age is insignificant and debt is significantly positive, whilst in the %Outsiders\nregression, both variables are significantly positive. Thus there is strong evidence that more\ncomplex firms have a higher outsider proportion but only mixed evidence that they have larger\nboards. Evidence on whether board size is determined by the costs and benefits of monitoring is\nmixed. Although Tobin\u2019s Q and STDDEV are significantly negative, R&D is significantly\npositive. Similarly, whilst concentration is significantly positive, FCF has a negative impact. As\nfor outsider proportion, there is no evidence it is related to monitoring costs and benefits.\nTobin\u2019s Q and R&D are insignificant, whilst STDDEV is significantly positive. Similarly, FCF\nand concentration are insignificant. Finally, ROA is significantly negative in both regressions,\nconsistent with the hypothesis that well performing CEOs are able to negotiate a small board\nwith a low outsider proportion. Overall these results support the hypothesis developed in Section\n3 that UK board structures will be determined by advisory needs and CEO influence, but not by\nthe costs and benefits of monitoring. We now check the robustness of this conclusion.\nINSERT TABLE 4 HERE\n6.3. Robustness tests\nIn Equations (1)-(2) we include all proxy variables simultaneously. This is potentially\nproblematic if the variables are correlated with one another, biasing the estimated coefficients\ntowards zero. To control for this, we firstly enter the variables for each hypothesis individually\n(Boone et al., 2007). This changes the sign and significance of some of the coefficients but our\nconclusions remain the same.11 Secondly, we use principal components to transform the proxy\nvariables for each hypothesis into a single linear combination that accounts for the highest\nproportion of their variance, hence capturing their commonality and being better proxies for the\n11 In the board size regression; the R&D coefficient is insignificantly negative when included without Tobin\u2019s Q\nand STDDEV. In the %Outsiders regression; the Age coefficient is insignificant when included without Debt; the\n14\nunderlying information (see e.g., Boone et al., 2007; Linck et al., 2007a). We create three new\nproxy variables; Complex is the principal factor for the information contained in Age and Debt,\nMonitoring costs for Tobin\u2019s Q, R&D, and STDDEV, and Private benefits for FCF and\nConcentration.12 Columns (2) and (4) of Table 4 report the results using these principal\ncomponents. Size and complexity are consistently significantly positive. Monitoring costs are\nsignificantly negative for board size but insignificant for outsider proportion. Private benefits are\ninsignificantly negatively related to board size and outsider proportion. These results are\nconsistent with and reinforce those in Columns (1) and (3).\nTo check the robustness of our findings to extreme observations, we employ robust\nregression, median regression, and iteratively reweighted least squares regression techniques. In\norder to further address concerns about independence of observations we follow Linck et al.,\n(2007a) and analyze three sub samples of observations based on every three years (1981,\n1984,\u20262002; 1982,1985,..2000; 1983,1986,..2001). Our results may be biased towards zero\nbecause of a lack of cross-sectional variation prior to 1988 due to low board composition\nreporting prior to then, and we therefore recalculate results from 1988 onwards only. The results\nusing these alternative methods are similar to those in Table 4, and our conclusions unchanged.\nDespite controlling for industry and time fixed effects, endogeneity caused by unobserved\nheterogeneity at the firm specific level could still be a problem, and we therefore employ a firm\nfixed effects model. The results are reported in Table 5 below. The results for board size\n(Columns (1)-(2)) are very similar to those in Table 4. The results for %Outsiders (Columns (3)-\n(4)), show that the results for monitoring costs, benefits, and ROA are very similar. However,\nthe results for firm size, age and debt are now of a negative sign and statistically insignificant,\nindicating that outsider proportion is not determined by advising requirements. However, it has\nbeen argued (Coles et al., 2006) that a fixed-effects approach will reduce statistical power\nbecause most of the variation in board size and composition arises in the cross section rather\nTobin\u2019s Q coefficient is significantly negative when included without R&D and STDDEV; and the Concentration\ncoefficient is insignificantly positive when included without FCF.\n15\nthan the time series. Hence, it is not possible to categorically conclude that the strong cross\nsectional relation between outsider proportion and advising requirements is a spurious one.\nINSERT TABLE 5 HERE\nAnother endogeneity problem is that of reverse causality, whereby firm specific explanatory\nvariables are determined by board structure rather than vice versa. In particular, Yermack (1996)\nfinds that board size and %Outsiders have negative impacts on Tobin\u2019s Q and ROA, whilst\nCheng (2007) finds that board size has a negative impact on STDDEV. In order to address this,\nwe follow Yermack (1996) and firstly re-estimate Equations (1)-(2) in an instrumental variables\nframework, using lagged values of Tobin\u2019s Q, STDDEV and ROA as instruments for current\nvalues. Secondly, we use up to three year lagged values of Tobin\u2019s Q, STDDEV and ROA\ninstead of current values. For Equation (1) we employ instruments and lags for Tobin\u2019s Q,\nSTDDEV and ROA, whilst for Equation (2) we only do so for ROA. The new estimates (not\ntabulated) are very similar to the original estimates in Table 4. We conclude that the evidence\nsupports the argument that past firm specific measures do influence board structure.\nA further potential source of bias is that of omitted variables. In particular, previous studies\nshow that CEO\/board ownership and industrial diversification are important board structure\ndeterminants. We test the impact of these variables on sub-samples for which such data is\navailable. Aggregate board ownership is available on Datastream for the two most recent years.\nFor the board size (%Outsiders) sample, board ownership is available for 5,034 (4,412) firm\nyear observations with an average of 15.37% (14.45%) and median of 6.2% (5.2%). From 1988\nonwards, Datastream reports the breakdown of firm sales by 3-digit SIC codes. Consistent with\nprior studies (e.g., Linck et al., 2007a), we employ the number of reported segments as a proxy\nfor diversification. For the board size (%Outsiders) sample, the number of segments is available\nfor 14,894 (13,580) firm year observations, whilst for both samples, the average (median)\nnumber of segments is 1.73 (1). In Table 6 below we report the results of running Models (1)\nand (3) from Table 4, including separately board ownership and the number of segments.\n12 The Eigen values for each principal component exceed one and therefore have more power than any one of the\n16\nINSERT TABLE 6 HERE\nThe coefficient for board ownership is positive and marginally significant in the board size\nregression (Column (1)) and significantly negative in the %Outsiders regression (Column (2)).\nThe former finding is inconsistent with previous findings which find a negative impact, whilst\nthe latter finding is consistent with previous studies. The impact of the other explanatory\nvariables on board size are similar to those in Table 4 and hence not affected by the inclusion of\nboard ownership. However, for the %Outsiders regression, the coefficients for age and debt are\nno longer significant. In the case of age, this difference is not driven by the smaller sample\nemployed because when board ownership is excluded, the coefficient for age is still significantly\npositive (although this is not the case for debt). There is therefore evidence that complexity does\nnot have a positive impact on outsider proportion when board ownership is included.13\nColumns (3)-(4) of Table 6 show that the number of segments coefficient is insignificantly\npositive in the board size regression, and significantly positive in the %Outsiders regression. The\ninclusion of this variable does not change the impact of other explanatory variables, which are\nconsistent with the regression run on the same sub-sample of firms with number of segments\nexcluded. We saw above that proxies for complexity are not significant in explaining\n%Outsiders with a fixed effects framework or when board ownership is controlled for, and the\ninclusion of the number of business segments does not change this conclusion.14\n6.4. Summary\nIn summary, the results in this section strongly support the hypothesis that board size is\ndetermined by advisory needs and CEO influence whilst outsider proportion is determined by\nCEO influence. This conclusion is robust to a range of econometric methods. There is also a\nstrong cross-sectional positive relation between outsider proportion and advisory needs.\nHowever, this is not robust to controlling for unobserved firm specific effects and board\noriginal proxies by itself. The second components have Eigen values of less than one and are therefore excluded.\n13 A principal components analysis results in the same conclusion. For the %Outsiders regression, the complex\nfactor is insignificant when board ownership is included, yet significantly positive when ownership is excluded.\n14 The number of segments is not significant in the %Outsiders regression when firm fixed effects are included.\nSimilarly, it is not significant using OLS when both number of segments and board ownership are included.\n17\nownership. Our findings support the hypothesis that UK boards, in contrast to US boards, will\nnot be determined by monitoring costs and benefits. Our evidence however shows that UK\nboards are not randomly structured since the regression models explain up to 45% of their\nvariation. As such, our results undermine the view that UK boards can be improved by\ngovernance reforms based on uniform rules. We now turn to study the impact of such reforms.\n7. The impact of soft regulation on board structure\nIn the UK since the early 1990s a number of reports (Cadbury, 1992; Greenbury, 1995;\nHampel, 1998; Turnbull, 1999; Myners, 2001; Higgs, 2003) have made recommendations for\nbest practice in different aspects of corporate governance, which now form part of the Combined\nCode on Corporate Governance (Financial Reporting Council, 2006). Listed firms must explain\nany non-compliance in their annual reports. The Cadbury (1992) and Hampel (1998) reports are\nthose over our sample period most relevant for board structure.15 A key recommendation of\nCadbury (published in December 2002, implemented on 30\/06\/1993) was that boards should\ninclude at least three outsiders. A key recommendation of Hampel (published in January 1998,\nimplemented on 31\/12\/1998) was that boards should comprise at least one third outsiders.\nThe UK voluntary approach allows boards to be structured according to their own specific\nrequirements, an approach supported by the evidence presented thus far. However, comply-or-\nexplain will only achieve greater flexibility when investors are capable of evaluating non-\ncompliance explanations (Filatochev et al., 2007). For example, Tafara (2007) argues that the\nmandatory approach is more appropriate for the US because of its relatively less sophisticated\nshareholder base consisting of a high proportion of retail investors. Given the prescriptive nature\nof the Combined Code, and the fact that it provides very limited guidelines for investors to\ninterpret non-compliance, it remains to be seen whether companies will diverge from its\nrecommendations and whether underlying board structure determinants will change.\n7.1. Compliance levels before and after the reforms\n15 Greenbury (1995) focused on executive pay, Turnbull (1999) on internal control, and Myners (2001) on\ninstitutional investors.\n18\nTable 7 below reports compliance levels before and after the Cadbury and Hampel reforms.\nPanel A categorizes firms according to whether in the financial year prior to Cadbury\nimplementation (30\/06\/1993), they have three outsiders, and by whether, following this date for\nall remaining firm observations, the firm always has, never has, or irregularly has, three\noutsiders. In Panel B, firms are categorized according to whether in the financial year prior to\nHampel implementation (31\/12\/1998), they have at least one third outsiders, and by whether,\nfollowing this date for all remaining firm observations, the firm always has, never has, or\nirregularly has, at least one third outsiders. In both panels and subsequent analysis, only firms\nwith observations available both before and after the implementation dates are included to\nmaintain sample composition pre- and post-reform (1,063 for Cadbury, 1,155 for Hampel).\nINSERT TABLE 7 HERE\nA number of important points can be discerned from Table 7. Firstly, 46% of firms are not in\ncompliance with Cadbury beforehand, whilst only 18% of firms are not in compliance with\nHampel beforehand. Therefore the Cadbury recommendation has more potential to impact board\nstructures.16 Although a number of these non-complying firms have complied at some point\npreviously (132 prior to Cadbury, 88 prior to Hampel) the majority has not (359 prior to\nCadbury, 118 prior to Hampel). Secondly, following the reforms, a large proportion of firms\neither never comply (15% following Cadbury, 6% following Hampel) or comply irregularly\n(44% following Cadbury, 16% following Hampel).17 Therefore many firms do not appear overly\nconcerned about compliance, and make use of the flexibility that the regulation offers.\nAlthough there is significant non-compliance, the proportion of firms in compliance, either\non a continual or irregular basis, is higher following both reforms. For example, of the 359 (118)\nfirms never in compliance prior to Cadbury (Hampel), only 140 (58) are never in compliance\nafterwards. The increase in the proportion of firms complying is statistically significant. Sign\ntests for differences in the proportion of firms in compliance in the year before and after the\n16 This clearly follows from the average sample board size of seven, since one third of seven is less than three, and\ntherefore compliance with Cadbury implies automatic compliance with Hampel for an average firm.\n19\nreforms (54% to 59% for Cadbury; 82% to 85% for Hampel) are significant at the one percent\nlevel. However these tests do not take account of the long term trends (reported in Figure 1\nabove) or other determinants of board structure that may be changing over time.\n7.2. The impact of the reforms on board structure\nTo examine the impact of the reforms more rigorously, we employ a change model where the\nannual change in board structure (board size, percentage of outsiders, number of outsiders, and\nnumber of insiders) is the dependent variable. By modelling changes in board structure rather\nthan levels, we control for the long term trends shown in Figure 1. Our explanatory variables\ninclude dummy variables for the year prior to and the five years following the Cadbury and\nHampel implementation dates. Firms are included if data is available both before and after the\nspecific reform, and a maximum of five years data either side of the reforms is employed.18\nYears -5 to -2 prior to the reforms act as the base years against which to compare the dummy\nvariables. Control variables are industry dummy variables and changes in all the firm specific\nvariables employed above (coefficients not reported). The results are shown in Table 8 below.19\nINSERT TABLE 8 HERE\nPanel A reveals a significantly large increase in board size, and the number and proportion of\noutside directors in the year prior to Cadbury. Although the impact occurs before Cadbury we\nare confident in attributing it to Cadbury because the recommendations were made public and\nreceived widespread support one year prior to implementation (Cadbury, 1992). We find no\nsignificant impact of Cadbury on the number of insiders, and hence no evidence that Cadbury\nresulted in firms removing executives to make way for non-executives. Panel B shows that\nHampel has only an insignificantly positive impact on the number of outsiders (year +1). There\nis also evidence of a marginally significant (10 percent level) increase in the number of insiders,\n17 Those complying irregularly do not appear to be simply complying with a lag. For example, for 368 of the 644\nfirms that comply irregularly following both reforms, we observe compliance followed by non-compliance.\n18 The first year included is hence 1988, for which board composition data is widely available (see discussion in\nSection 4.1), ensuring that changing sample composition does not bias the results.\n19 R-square is low for all regressions in Table 8. Hence our explanatory variables explain much less of the variation\nin board structure changes than they do the variation in board structure levels. Previous studies examining board\nstructure changes also report comparable low r-squares (see e.g., Yermack, 1996, Table 3, Column 4).\n20\nfor which there does not appear any obvious explanation.20 The increase in the number of both\noutsiders and insiders results in a significant increase in board size in the year following\nHampel. The impact on outsider proportion is insignificantly positive.21, 22\n7.3. The determinants of compliance\nThe evidence presented so far suggests that different board structures are optimal for different\nfirms, and that the reforms had a significant impact on board structure. If firms treat the\ncompliance decision as a \u2018box ticking\u2019 exercise to avoid the costs of non-compliance (i.e., the\ntime spent justifying non-compliance), then comply or explain may cause inefficient boards and\nworsen corporate performance. We therefore examine whether the compliance decision is due to\nthe normal economic determinants, or whether it is arbitrary. We compare those firms that go\nfrom not being in compliance to always being in compliance (Column (4) in Table 7), with those\nfirms that are not in compliance beforehand and are never in compliance afterwards (Column (5)\nin Table 7). The former appear the most likely to have complied because of non-economic\ndeterminants, and hence provide the cleanest test. We employ a logit model, in which the\ndependent variable is set equal to one for the former group and equal to zero for the latter group.\nWe restrict the analysis to post-reform years. The results are shown in Table 9 below.\nINSERT TABLE 9 HERE\nCompared to non-adopting firms, complying firms are significantly larger, more leveraged,\nand have lower profitability (although the latter is not significant for Hampel). The impact of\nmonitoring costs is not consistent, having a significantly negative impact on Cadbury\ncompliance but a significantly positive impact on Hampel compliance. This is consistent with\nour general finding that total number of directors (outsiders or insiders) is negatively related to\n20 The positive impact of Hampel on the number of insiders is not inconsistent with the negative trend in Figure 1.\nThe dependent variable is the change in the number of insiders, and hence estimates whether the change (which\ncould be positive or negative) is greater or less than the change prior to the reforms. For example, in the case of the\nnumber of insiders, this could decline significantly in each year, but the change could be significantly less negative\nin the year following Hampel and in which case the explanatory variable for year+1 would be significantly positive.\n21 Although Hampel has a greater impact on the number of insiders compared to outsiders, it does not follow that\nboard independence will be reduced. This is because the number of outsiders is lower than the number of insiders.\nFor example, if both outsiders and insiders increase by an equal number, there will be a positive (not neutral) impact\non the proportion of outsiders.\n21\nmonitoring costs whilst outsider proportion is not. Monitoring benefits are not significantly\nrelated to compliance with either reform. Overall, this evidence suggests that compliance is not\narbitrary but instead related to the same economic determinants that determine outside director\nrepresentation in general.23 Our findings are consistent with previous findings (Young, 2000;\nPeasnell et al., 2003; Hillier and McColgan, 2006; Lasfer, 2006; Dahya and McConnell, 2007)\nthat Cadbury complying firms are larger, have lower board ownership, and lower profitability.\n7.4. The impact of the reforms on board structure determinants\nWe now examine whether the reforms alter the fundamental economic determinants of board\nstructures, by interacting each explanatory variable with a dummy variable set equal to one for\nall years post-Cadbury, zero for all years prior. The results are displayed in Table 10 below.24\nINSERT TABLE 10 HERE\nIn the board size regressions (Columns (1)-(2)), the coefficient for the interactive Size*post-\nCadbury variable is significantly negative, indicating that the relationship between firm size and\nboard size is significantly weaker following Cadbury. An F-test shows that the underlying\npositive relation is weakened but not fundamentally changed (by rejecting the hypothesis that\nthe sum of the coefficients on firm size and its interaction term with the post-Cadbury dummy\nequal zero). Similarly, the significantly negative relation between Tobin\u2019s Q and board size is\nweakened after Cadbury, but an F-test shows that the negative relation still holds post-Cadbury.\nFurthermore, the principal component analysis in Column (2) shows no evidence that the\nrelation between monitoring costs and board size significantly changes following Cadbury.\nIn the %Outsiders regressions (Columns (3)-(4)), there is some evidence that the positive\nrelation between outsider proportion and firm size is strengthened post Cadbury (Column (3)),\nbut this does not hold in the principal components regression (Column (4)). The positive relation\n22 We run the same models using changes in whether the firm is in compliance or not with the particular reform.\nWe find a significant increase in the number of firms in compliance with Cadbury (in the year prior), but no\nsignificant increase in the number of firms in compliance with Hampel.\n23 We investigate the difference between firms always complying (Column (4), Table 7) with those complying\nirregularly (Column (6), Table 7). They are generally of the same sign as in Table 9, but of lower magnitude and\nsignificance, suggesting that the extent of within-firm compliance is also determined by efficiency considerations.\n24 As in Section 7.2, only data from 1988 onwards is included here to ensure that changing sample composition\n(due to increasing board composition coverage prior to this date) does not bias the results.\n22\nbetween outsider proportion and complexity is also strengthened, suggesting that complex firms\nare more likely to use outside directors than was the case prior to Cadbury. Despite the emphasis\nplaced on monitoring by the reforms, the relation between outsider proportion and monitoring\ncosts (or benefits) does not change. However, the relation between %Outsiders and profitability\nis significantly less negative following Cadbury, and an F-test does not reject the hypothesis that\nthe sum of the coefficients on profitability and its interaction term with the post-Cadbury\ndummy equal zero. Therefore in the post-Cadbury period there is no longer a significant relation\nbetween profitability and board composition, suggesting that well performing CEOs have less\ninfluence to structure boards. This is consistent with a key objective of Cadbury to reduce the\ncontrol of powerful CEOs and with US findings which show that following SOA, CEO\nownership no longer has a negative impact on outsider proportion (Linck et al., 2007a).\n8. Summary and conclusions\nUsing a large sample of UK firms from 1981 to 2002, we examine the trends and\ndeterminants of board size and composition. The sample employed is the largest and most\ncomprehensive employed for the UK, giving us confidence in the generalization of our findings,\nwhilst the long time series allows us to document for the first time the long term trends in UK\nboard structures.\nWe argue that the determinants of board structure will depend on the specific function of\nboards within a particular country, and analyze UK board structures in the context of the legal\nand institutional background. Due to factors such as the weak enforcement of directors\u2019 legal\nduties and the strong role of institutional investors, we hypothesize that UK boards will play a\nweak monitoring role and hence will not be structured according to the costs or benefits of\nmonitoring. Our evidence supports this. Although we find, consistent with US studies, that board\nsize and outsider proportion are positively impacted by greater advising needs and negatively\nimpacted by CEO influence, outsider proportion is not related to monitoring costs or benefits.\nTherefore board structure determinants for UK firms differ in a predictable way from US firms.\n23\nConsistent with US studies however, we conclude that UK boards are not randomly structured\nsince the regression models explain a significant amount of their variation.\nOver the sample period we document a steady increase in the number and proportion of\noutside directors, and a decline in the number of inside directors and board size. These trends are\nbroadly similar to those in the US and can be traced to pressure from various UK institutions and\ngovernance reforms. Recommendations for greater outside director representation have been\ndriven by the view that such directors can play an important monitoring role, although the lack\nof relation between UK board structures and monitoring costs and benefits provides no support\nfor this view. The key governance reforms over the period recommended, but did not mandate,\nthat firms should have at least three outside directors (Cadbury), and one third of outside\ndirectors (Hampel). Both reforms increased board size, whilst Cadbury also increased the\nnumber and proportion of non-executive directors. A significant number of firms either do not\ncomply or comply irregularly, suggesting that firms value the flexibility offered by soft\nregulation. Compliance is not arbitrary, but instead driven by the same economic considerations\nthat determine board structure in general. The negative relation between performance and\noutsider proportion is no longer evident following the reforms, possibly reflecting less\nopportunity for well performing CEOs to influence board structures.\nIn the context of the UK, soft regulation does not therefore appear to interfere with the\nefficient structuring of boards, and hence appears strongly preferred to a mandated approach. It\nis important to note though that the success of a comply or explain approach depends on investor\nsophistication. In its absence, the pressure to comply can be substantial, and force firms with\nidiosyncratic board structures into adopting suboptimal ones. Codes of best practice should,\ntherefore, pay very careful and explicit attention to mitigating factors, many of which have been\nclearly documented by the recent research in this area.\n24\nReferences\nAssociation of British Insurers (ABI), 1990.
