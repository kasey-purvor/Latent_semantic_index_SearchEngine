A quadratic relationship between the pump power\nand second-harmonic intensity was observed. \uf8e9 1999 Optical Society of America\nOCIS codes: 060.2310, 190.4710, 190.4370, 240.0310, 230.7370.Organic materials have larger hyperpolarizabilities\nthan their inorganic counterparts, and therefore vari-\nous donor\u2013 \u0001p-bridge\u0002\u2013acceptor materials have been\ninvestigated for nonlinear optical processes, in par-\nticular, for second-harmonic generation (SHG).1 The\nmolecules tend to adopt an antiparallel arrangement\nbut, by use of Langmuir\u2013Blodgett (LB) deposition tech-\nniques, the required noncentrosymmetric alignment\ncan be achieved to thicknesses suitable for waveguid-\ning.2 \u2013 4 Efficient SHG requires the phases of the in-\nteracting beams to be matched and, among the various\nmethods available for LB waveguides, C\u02c7erenkov-type\nphase matching requires the least stringent control\nof the parameters for frequency conversion.4 \u2013 7 Thus,\neven though most donor\u2013(p-bridge)\u2013acceptor materi-\nals are not transparent at visible wavelengths, this is\nnot a problem because the second harmonic propagates\nin the substrate and not in the film. In this regime\nthe fundamental beam is guided in the LB film and the\ngenerated second harmonic is radiated into the sub-\nstrate, as shown in Fig. 1\nGrating and prism couplings have been used with\nLB waveguides, but the former can suffer from low\ncoupling eff iciency and the latter can easily damage\nthe fragile organic overlay. Fiber-optic coupling\nmay be preferable, but, in a previous study, Sel-\nfridge et al.8 reported a low conversion efficiency\nfor hemicyanine LB films deposited cylindrically\nabout a 600-mm-diameter core of a multimode op-\ntical fiber. This may be attributed, in part, to\nthe fact that only a small proportion of the pump\npower is guided in propagating fiber modes phase\nmatched to the film and, in part, to the film\u2019s being\nstructurally disordered. The film is predominantly\nnoncentrosymmetric (Z type) but, as deposition on\nthe upstroke was accompanied by deposition, al-\nbeit slight, on each subsequent downstroke, regions\nof the film must have a centrosymmetric Y -type\ncharacter.\nWe report a configuration in which the light guided\nby a single-mode optical fiber is evanescently coupled\ninto a LB overlay waveguide and the second harmonic0146-9592\/99\/171194-03$15.00\/0is generated in the form of C\u02c7erenkov radiation. A re-\nfined deposition technique ensures noncentrosymmet-\nric Z-type alignment of molecules.\nThe device is based on an in-line fiber-optic channel-\ndropping filter and consists of a planar LB waveguide\nupon a side-polished single-mode optical fiber,9 \u2013 11 the\ntwo being evanescently coupled (see Fig. 2). Optical\npower is coupled from the optical fiber into the LB\nfilm at a particular wavelength lm when the phase-\nmatching condition between the fiber and the overlay\nmode is satisfied, i.e., when the effective refractive\nindices of the waveguides are equal. Insertion of a\nphase-matching condition into the eigenvalue equation\nfor the zero-order mode of the three-layer, asymmetric,\nuniaxial waveguide12 describes the dependence of lm\non the thickness and the refractive index of the planar\nwaveguide:\n2pd\nlm\nq\nno2 2 neff 2 \u0001 Fa 1 Fcl , (1)\nwhere neff is the effective refractive index of the fiber\nmode (neff \u0001 bm2p\u0003l, where bm is the mode propaga-\ntion constant); d and no are the thickness and the\nrefractive index of the overlay and Fa and Fcl are\npolarization-dependent phase-change terms at the\noverlay\u2013superstrate and overlay\u2013fiber cladding\nboundaries, respectively. TE and TM polarized light\nwould be expected to couple to the overlay at different\nwavelengths. Furthermore, lm depends on the over-\nlay thickness, and the LB technique permits control\nto within one molecular length \u0001\u00043 nm\u0002, thus per-\nmitting the overlay waveguide characteristics to be\ndefined such that phase matching occurs at the de-\nsired pump wavelength. This, coupled with the fact\nFig. 1.

Schematic diagram of the fiber-optic device.\nthat some materials, albeit very few, deposit in a\nnoncentrosymmetric Z-type manner, makes the LB\ndeposition technique ideal for the fabrication of such\ndevices. Although it is not apparent from Eq. (1), lm\nalso depends on temperature by virtue of the large\ndn\u0003dT characteristics of the overlay and can be ther-\nmally tuned. For the LB film-forming material used,\nlm\u0003DT \u0001 20.6 nm\u0003\u00b1C.\nThe device was fabricated by removal of a portion of\ncladding from a 30-mm section of fiber by an annular\npolishing process.13 The cladding was removed to\nwithin approximately 2 mm of the core, monitored\nby an oil drop test,14 with a polishing technique\npreviously reported.9 The optically nonlinear dye,\nE-N -octadecyl-4-[2-(4-dibutylaminophenyl)ethenyl]-\nquinolinium octadecylsulfate (Fig. 3), was spread from\na dilute chloroform\u2013methanol solution onto the pure\nwater subphase of a Nima Technology LB trough,\nleft for 5 min, and then compressed at 0.5 cm2 s21\n(equivalent to 0.1% s21 of total area). The LB film\nwas transferred to the polished region of the fiber\n(Spectran SMC-AO1060B; cutoff wavelength 987 nm,\ncore diameter 6.4 mm, cladding diameter 125 mm)\nby the modified deposition technique previously\ndescribed, which prevents deposition on the down-\nstroke.15 Assuming complete deposition, a 184-layer\nfilm was obtained at a surface pressure of 35 mN m21.\nLight from a quartz halogen lamp and a monochro-\nmator was coupled via a polarizer and a 203 mi-\ncroscope objective lens into the fiber. A fiber-optic\nstate-of-polarization controller was used to define the\npolarization in the polished region, and a photodi-\node and a lock-in amplifier detected the output. This\narrangement permitted continuous on-line monitoring\nof the optical fiber\u2013LB overlay waveguide structure\nduring deposition such that the operating wavelength\nlm could be accurately set. The resultant channel-\ndropping response shows lm centered on 1064 nm with\na drop in transmission of \u000413 dB (Fig. 4).\nC\u02c7erenkov-radiation-type phase matching requires\nthat the effective refractive index of the fundamental\nwave propagating in the LB waveguide be greater\nthan the substrate\u2019s fundamental refractive index and\nless than its second-harmonic index; i.e., ns \u00012v\u0002 .\nNeff \u0001v\u0002 . ns\u0001v\u0002. The refractive indices of the cladding\nare ns\u0001v\u0002 \u0001 1.4497 and ns\u00012v\u0002 \u0001 1.460, and, using an\nequivalent slab waveguide model of optical fibers,16\nwe calculated an effective refractive index of 1.452\nfor the fundamental in the LB film. Light from a\nQ-switched Nd:YAG laser, operating at 1064 nm with\na pulse duration of 10 ns and a repetition rate of\n2 Hz, was coupled into the optical fiber, as shown in\nFig. 5. The region of fiber coated with the LB film\nwas mounted upon a Peltier thermoelectric element\nto permit thermal control of the resonant wavelength\nlm and hence the amount of light coupled into theoverlay. The second-harmonic intensity relative to\nthe signal from a Y -cut quartz reference was moni-\ntored by photomultiplier tubes, and the power of the\nguided fundamental exiting the fiber was continu-\nally measured by a powermeter.\nThe second-harmonic intensity from the LB overlay\nis plotted as a function of fiber transmission. We\nobtained the data shown in Fig. 6 by thermally varying\nlm and consequently the pump power coupled into\nFig. 3. Molecular structure of the quinolinium dye.\nFig. 4.

In this case the increased transmission\nis indicative of reduced coupling into the overlay,\nand the second-harmonic intensity decreases as the\nsquare of the transmitted fundamental intensity. In\ncontrast, we obtained the data shown in Fig. 7 by\nvarying the light coupled into the fiber, and therefore\ninto the overlay, at a constant temperature of 21.4 6\n0.1 \u00b1C. The slope is positive, and, as expected from\ntheory, the second-harmonic intensity increases as the\nsquare of the fundamental intensity.\nSHG from a LB waveguide overlay, coated onto\na side-polished single-mode optical fiber, has been\ndemonstrated for the first time to our knowledge. The\nsecond harmonic is generated as C\u02c7erenkov radiation.\nIt is emitted into the area surrounding the LB overlay\nand is not guided by the LB film or fiber core. Prelimi-\nnary results have shown the expected quadratic SHG\ndependence on pump power. Furthermore, as deposit-\ning the layers either on the upstroke, as described\nherein, or on the downstroke alters the orientation of\nthe molecular dipole within the LB overlay, optimiza-\ntion of conversion efficiency can be realized by fabri-\ncation of susceptibility-inverted waveguide structures.\nThese have been described for LB waveguides by use of\nconventional coupling techniques.3,7\nWe are grateful to the Engineering and Physi-\ncal Sciences Research Council, UK, for support of\nthis research and for providing a studentship to S.
