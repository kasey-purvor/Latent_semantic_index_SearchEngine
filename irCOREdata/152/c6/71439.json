Likewise in the focus groups there was little direct appeal to religion but the main \nthemes were \u2018interfering with nature\u2019 and the \u2018status of the embryo\u2019, with the latter being \nused more effectively to try to close down further discussion. In general there was a close \ncorrespondence between the media analysis and focus group responses, possibly \ndemonstrating that much of the information and discourse in this area is drawn from media \ncoverage or that the media reflect public discourse accurately.  \n \nAbstract word count: 291 \n \nKeywords: UK, human cloning, attitude, focus groups, media analysis, survey \n \nFull word count: 8425 \n 3\nIntroduction \n \nIn the post-genomic era, the growing capability of scientists to apply cloning technology to \nhuman embryos has prompted widespread media reporting and discussion \u2013 most \ncontroversially over claims that a human clone had been born (e.g. Guardian, 2003). \nAlthough these claims were widely discredited, it is true that today the cloning of human \ngenetic material can no longer be seen as the domain of science fiction. Unlike many other \ncountries including the USA, the cloning of human cells has been legally sanctioned in the \nUK for the purposes of medical research (\u2018therapeutic cloning\u2019). However, at the same time, \nspecific legislation has been developed to outlaw reproductive cloning, where a cloned \nhuman embryo is implanted and allowed to develop to full term (HMSO, 2001). \n \nCloning is the technique of creating an identical copy of an organism from its genetic \nmaterial using the technique of cell nuclear replacement (MRC, 2002). A distinction is made \n- at least in law - between therapeutic or research cloning and reproductive cloning. The \nformer harvests special cells called stem cells which, at the early embryonic stage of \ndevelopment, have a unique ability to divide and differentiate into a range of body tissues. As \nstem cells from a cloned embryo will be genetically compatible with their donor, their \npotential benefits lie in medical therapy for a range of diseases and degenerative conditions. \nIn reproductive cloning, the same technique is used to create a human embryo that is then \nallowed to develop into a baby that is an identical genetic match to the donor. \n \nMuch of the controversy and debate surrounding human cloning for both therapeutic and \nreproductive purposes centres on moral and ethical issues around the creation of a human \nembryo. A key issue is under what circumstances, if any, can it be considered acceptable to \nend one life \u2013 that of the embryo - with the objective of saving another (Reiss, 2002). Exactly \nwhen in its development should a human embryo be accorded human rights and protection? \nThis issue is hotly debated within ethical and religious contexts (for example, see McCarthy, \n2003) and is unlikely ever to be resolved, although advisory bodies generally acknowledge \nthat there are specific circumstances where using stem cells from human embryos can be \njustified by the potential health benefits arising from the research. \n \nA subsidiary set of arguments around human cloning arises from the connections between \ntherapeutic and reproductive cloning (Bowring, 2004). The reasoning behind what may be \ntermed the \u2018slippery slope\u2019 argument is that advances on therapeutic applications of cloning \nwill inevitably lead to reproductive cloning, regardless of its legal status. \n \nA number of large scale surveys report positive attitudes among the public towards science \nand new scientific developments (Gaskell, Allum & Stares, 2003b; MORI, 2005) but the \nsame sources typically reveal considerable public scepticism about the motivations of \nscientists, and about the science the application of new technologies. Certainly for genetic \nscience there are particular public concerns about privacy, ethics and tampering with nature \n(Calnan, Montaner & Horne, 2005). There has been little research in the UK specifically \nconsidering the ways in which the public makes sense of cloning.  \n  \nCalnan et al. (2005) surveyed members of the public in England and Wales about their \nattitudes to new health care technologies, science and trust in health care practitioners. A \nscenario on reproductive human cloning was used based on an infertile couple participating \nin a clinical trial to have a baby. Only 12 percent accepted that the couple should participate \nin the trial compared with 68 percent who rejected it. Other scenarios based on non-\n 4\nembryonic stem cell therapy and genetic screening were received much more favourably, \nleading the authors to conclude that support for genetic technologies is heavily dependent on \nits stated purpose.  \n \nIn 2005, an online survey by YouGov questioned over 2000 adults about cloning and embryo \nresearch (YouGov, 2005). A total of 66 percent agreed that \u2018the rights of the patient are more \nimportant than the embryo\u2019, with only 15 percent disagreeing with this statement. A majority \nof 58 percent endorsed the view that embryos are not really human beings from the moment \nof conception but believe that their use should be governed by law. Just over one quarter \nfound therapeutic cloning acceptable using embryonic stem cells to treat disease, but a much \nlower proportion found it acceptable for cosmetic purposes. Approximately 6 in 10 people \nthought that scientists give too little thought to the moral issues involved.  \n \nA qualitative study using reconvened focus groups by the Wellcome Trust (1998) concluded \nthat participants were overwhelmingly against cloning and that the provision of information \nabout cloning did little to modify reactions of shock, concern and fear around the technology. \nWhile most of the participants were familiar with the idea of reproductive cloning they lacked \nany prior knowledge of therapeutic cloning.  \n \nPrevious analyses of media coverage in this area have also highlighted the distinction made \nbetween therapeutic cloning as \u2018good\u2019 and reproductive cloning as \u2018bad\u2019 (Petersen, 2001) and \nalso examined the types of rhetorical devices used in the debate surrounding the use of stem \ncells and contrasting views of future developments (Kitzinger and Williams, 2005).  \n \nWhile provoking strong opinions among many, public surveys and consultation exercises \nabout human cloning show that attitudes vary according to its stated purpose, perceived \nutility and morality (e.g. Bates, Lynch, Bevan, & Condit, 2005; Gaskell, Allum, Bauer, \nJackson, Howard & Lindsey, 2003a; Gaskell et al., 2003b; HFEA, 1998). It is often \nuncertain, however, to what extent public opinion is influenced by the media environment at \nany given time or the manner and context in which questions about human cloning are asked. \nHow the potential harms and benefits of cloning are presented arguably has a direct impact \non the level of public support found in opinion polls (Genetics and Public Policy Center, \n2005). Public responses to human cloning must also be seen in the context of the current \nsocio-political climate; for example, recent research indicates that although some types of \nscientist continue to be considered as valuable sources of scientific information and advice \nabout science, there are growing public concerns that the independence of scientists may be \ncompromised by the interests of their funders and the commercialisation of such funding \n(MORI, 2005). These concerns may well have been further intensified by the recent highly \nvisible controversy around falsification of scientific data in this area (Wohn, 2006). \n \nThis brief overview of research exploring public perceptions and understandings of cloning \ndepicts a somewhat fragmented set of findings largely derived from studies using single \nmethods and ranging over a period of years over which there has been considerable \ndevelopments both in the science and in the accompanying media coverage.  \n \nThis paper reports multi-method research on public attitudes towards new genetic \ntechnologies in the UK. Drawing on both quantitative and qualitative data affords us a unique \nopportunity to investigate the nature, spread and strength of opinion among the British \npopulation and the resources and reasoning used by people to make judgements about this \ngenetic technology. We are able to locate our empirical findings in the context of media \n 5\nreporting of human cloning over the same time period, helping to provide a rounded and \ncurrent picture of human cloning as a public issue.  \n \nMethod \n \nThe data reported here were collected as part of a large study on attitudes to genomics which \ncomprised several separate elements. Data are reported from two quantitative pieces of work, \na national survey and an experimental vignette study, and two qualitative elements, a focus \ngroup study and media analyses. Each of these pieces of work was conducted separately and \nthere was no overlap in participants between the different pieces of work. The methods for \neach strand of work are described briefly below.  \n \nSurvey \n \nQuestions on human cloning were administered as self-completion items on the British Social \nAttitudes Survey, an annual survey of social and political attitudes in the UK that was \nconducted between June and September 2003. This yielded a nationally representative sample \nof approximately 2 500 adults aged 18 and above. The key questions in the survey for the \npurposes of this paper are four questions on attitudes to cloning for different purposes. The \nfirst three were on therapeutic cloning for different purposes and were preceded by a short \npreamble: \n \nYou might have heard of something called human cloning. One type of cloning would be \nif a person\u2019s genes were copied exactly and used to make an embryo. Cells from the \nembryo could be used to supply the person with tissues or organs that would be a \nperfect match for them, meaning their body would not reject them. Do you think this \nshould be allowed or not allowed for if a person \u2026?  \n1. .. needs an organ transplant \n2. .. needs treatment for Parkinson\u2019s Disease \n3. .. is generally in good health and wants to live longer \n \nWe also asked one question on reproductive human cloning:  \n \nAnother type of human cloning might be used to treat a young couple who are infertile \nand cannot have a child. Suppose that the genes from one of them were copied exactly \nand used to make an embryo with exactly the same genetic make up as that parent. Do \nyou think this should be allowed or not allowed \u2026?  \n \nFor further details about the design of this survey and the questions used see Park, Curtice, \nThomson, Bromley & Phillips (2004) and in particular Sturgis, Cooper, Fife-Schaw & \nShepherd (2004). \n \nVignette study \n \nParticipants in the vignette study comprised 368 adult members of the British general public \nwho were categorised as having either high or low trust in science. The study was carried out \nbetween May and September 2004. The groups were selected on the basis of agreement or \ndisagreement with the item \u201cThose in charge of new developments in genetic science cannot \nbe trusted to act in society\u2019s interests\u201d. Participants completed a baseline questionnaire \nassessing demographic and attitudinal variables and were then randomly assigned to receive \n 6\none of four vignettes. The vignettes described either therapeutic or reproductive cloning and \ncontained either arguments in favour of banning the technology outright or allowing it under \nregulated conditions. Thus the study had a two (therapeutic versus reproductive cloning) by \ntwo (arguments for banning or arguments for controlling the technology) between-subjects \nfactorial design. Participants then completed follow-up questions on their attitudes towards \nthe situation described in the vignette and cloning in general. For the present analysis the four \nitems of interest are: \n \n1. Cloning, as described, should be banned \n2. Cloning, as described, should be allowed under certain circumstances \n3. Cloning technology threatens the natural order of things \n4. Cloning technology poses no threat to future generations \n \nResponse options ranged from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The vignettes and \nthe questionnaire are available from the authors on request.  \n \nFocus groups \n \nThe focus group study was carried out between July 2004 and April 2005 and involved ten \ngroups which (potentially) addressed the issue of cloning. Eight were conducted at six \nlocations in England, Scotland and Wales with members of the general public who had no \nparticular involvement or investment in genomics-related issues. Four addressed health-\nrelated technologies; four did not focus on specific applications. Group members were \nrecruited by a fieldwork agency to reflect the demographic profile of the populations in the \nvarious group locations. Two additional focus group interviews were conducted with people \naffected by genetic disease, who were recruited through the Clinical Genetics Department of \na London hospital. The eight general public groups consisted of 80 individuals and the two \ngroups of people affected by genetic disease consisted of 12 individuals. Participants were \npaid an incentive of \u00a335 to take part.  \n \nEach focus group was facilitated by two moderators, using an interview schedule which, \namong other issues, invited participants to identify the developments in (health-related) \ngenetic technologies that they had heard about or encountered and to describe what they had \nheard, what their reactions have been and how they evaluate the acceptability of these \ntechnologies. In relation to cloning, if participants did not distinguish between reproductive \nand therapeutic cloning, the interviewers provided definitions of these technologies in line \nwith the definitions outlined previously and then asked participants about their responses.  \n \nInterviews were transcribed, coded in terms of content using N-Vivo and then subjected to an \nintegrative form of discourse analysis that attended to both relatively micro-level and macro-\nsocial features of talk (Wetherell, 1998) in order to identify the ways in which and the basis \non which \u2018attitudes\u2019 and \u2018knowledges\u2019 relevant to cloning are constructed and worked with. \nHowever, space constraints mean that, in this paper, findings from the focus group studies are \npresented more as the outcome of a social constructionist version of thematic analysis (Joff\u00e9 \n& Yardley, 2004) rather than in the level of detail normally expected in discourse analysis. \n \nMedia analyses \n \nA qualitative analysis of genomics-related texts was conducted on data drawn from \nnewspaper articles from six UK newspapers (the Times, the Guardian, the Daily Telegraph, \n 7\nthe Daily Mail, the Sun, and the Daily Mirror) during a 3-month monitoring period (12 \nJanuary \u2013 11 April 2004, inclusive). Using the method of discourse analysis (broadly defined) \nthis qualitative dataset was systematically analysed to identify central and recurring themes, \nconstructions and understandings of genomics.  \n \nResults \n \nThe following results are presented under two themes which emerged from the analysis of the \ndifferent types of data: the distinction between cloning for therapeutic or reproductive ends \nand values and beliefs underlying attitudes to cloning. In each case, results are presented from \ndifferent pieces of research in order to illustrate the contribution of each method to addressing \nthese general issues; given space constraints, it is not possible to present all of the relevant \nfindings from any one of the methods.  \n \nTherapeutic versus reproductive cloning \n \nEach of the data sets provides some insights into the nature of the distinction between \ntherapeutic and reproductive cloning. The survey and experimental data show that the \ninformation provided around the purpose of cloning were clearly related to judgements of \nvarious applications. Interestingly the focus group discussions indicated that when people are \nleft to their own devices they do not spontaneously differentiate these two facets. Both the \nfocus group discussions and the media analysis show the use of the \u2018slippery slope\u2019 metaphor \n(Bowring, 2004) affords a way of framing considerations of therapeutic and reproductive \ncloning. \n \nAnalysis of the survey data suggests that obvious benefit is important for the attitudes the \ngeneral public express towards therapeutic cloning.  The purpose of such cloning research \nclearly had an impact on the attitudes people expressed. Survey respondents were strongly in \nfavour of cloning where the benefits were clear (for an organ transplant or for Parkinson\u2019s \ndisease) but not where cloning was simply to prolong the life of a healthy individual (see \nTable 1). Although responses were more mixed when the application was reproductive, \nnonetheless a substantial number of people (38%) felt that it should definitely or probably be \nallowed (Table 1).  \n \nAs in the survey, the respondents in the vignette study were more positive towards \ntherapeutic cloning than they were towards reproductive cloning (Table 2). This was \nparticularly true for the questions directly related to the form of cloning \u2018as described\u2019 in the \nvignette but was also apparent for the questions which asked about cloning without \nspecifically referring to the vignette.  \n \nIn contrast, explicit distinctions between reproductive and therapeutic cloning did not \ntypically occur spontaneously within the focus group discussions, in line with analysis of \nearlier focus groups (Wellcome Trust, 1998). Often the initial discursive object was the \ngeneric concept of cloning, interpretable as reproductive cloning. The frequent references \nmade to \u2018Dolly the sheep\u2019 suggest that reproductive cloning currently operates as the \n\u2018default\u2019 reference point for the generic concept. Participant discussion of therapeutic and \nreproductive cloning as separate technologies often only occurred when one of the focus \ngroup facilitators made the differentiation. Aside from early invocations of the discursive \nresources of \u2018the status of the embryo\u2019 and \u2018interfering with nature\u2019, discussions of the \npermissibility of cloning as both a generic and differentiated technology followed a utilitarian \n 8\nethical framework: their permissibility was negotiated in terms of their constructed costs and \nbenefits.  \n \nAcross the focus group discussions, reproductive cloning was routinely constructed as failing \nto provide widespread appreciable benefits or as yielding only the most obscure benefits for a \nvery small number of individuals. The cloning of animals or humans was constructed as \nlikely only to benefit individuals with morally questionable motives and\/or with the financial \nmeans to secure the services of unscrupulous scientists. In conjunction with constructions of \nreproductive cloning as \u2018interfering with nature\u2019 and therefore as representing a potential \ncost, the constructed lack of general benefits of reproductive cloning warranted construction \nof it as an impermissible technology. The social undesirability of reproductive cloning was \nfurther evidenced by its invocation as a discursive resource in terms of being the implied end \npoint in \u2018slippery slope\u2019 arguments against the permissibility of therapeutic cloning. Some of \nthese features can be seen in the following extracts: \n \nArchie  Well, I think the trouble is once the science exists, you will never stop \nscientists pushing the envelope. They are\u2026they are going to take it further and \nfurther. I mean, you talk about this idea of what Gabi said about, you know, \nthere\u2019s allegedly been a child cloned in Italy. I\u2019m quite sure there\u2019s been \nchildren cloned, quite certain of it, but you won\u2019t hear about it, you know.  \nJocelyn You\u2019ll see a film about it. \nArchie You\u2019ll probably find Michael Jackson\u2019s got several at Neverland. \n(Focus Group 7) \n \nMegan The government have already said \u2018yes\u2019 to the therapeutic cloning. We\u2019re \nalready allowed to do that. The government decided for us that that\u2019s okay, \nwhich is a bit worrying, I think. I think we\u2019re the only European country that \napproved therapeutic cloning, I believe. It\u2019s one thing experimenting on \nembryos but also, it\u2019s a bit of a slippery slope into reproductive cloning, isn\u2019t \nit? That\u2019s the logical next step. Okay, they said \u2018Yes, that\u2019s wrong, everyone \nagrees, we\u2019re not going to clone a baby\u2019 but of course they will. \n(Focus group 1) \n \nIn contrast to reproductive cloning, where the differentiation between the two technologies \nwas made and where the link between therapeutic cloning and embryonic stem cell research \nwas also made, therapeutic cloning was constructed as a permissible technology on the basis \nof its potential benefits to human health. The construction of therapeutic cloning as \npotentially contributing to the development of treatments for debilitating conditions, such as \nAlzheimer\u2019s disease and Parkinson\u2019s disease, warranted arguments in support of its \npermissibility. However, the construction of such treatments as unquestionable benefits was \noccasionally contested through the re-invocation of discourses of \u2018naturality\u2019 and \u2018natural \nselection\u2019. While the development of such treatments was constructed as desirable and \nbeneficial on an individual level, they were occasionally constructed as not desirable and not \nbeneficial on a collective level where they might result in increasing and increasingly aged \npopulations. The potential benefits of therapeutic cloning and embryonic stem cell research \nwere recast as potential costs in the context of global economic and environmental \nsustainability. The acceptance of therapeutic cloning on the basis of health benefits and \nresistance to acceptance on the grounds of interference with a natural process are evident in \nthe extracts below: \n \n 9\nSophie So, then they\u2019re growing the stem cells\u2026Is that the\u2026? Which\u2026which one is \nthat? \nDiana Therapeutic cloning. \nSophie Therapeutic. So, that\u2019s grown just for that. So, if you think about it, you\u2019re not \nreproducing. You\u2019re not messing about with another life. What you\u2019re doing is \nsustaining one that\u2019s here already. So, when you see how people suffer with it \n[Alzheimer\u2019s or Parkinson\u2019s] and what\u2026 Sorry. They don\u2019t suffer because, \nobviously, they don\u2019t know. It\u2019s the family and the grandchildren. I mean, you \nlook at it like that and you think, \u2018Well, yes, if this was just to help them a \nlittle bit\u2019 \n(Focus group 5) \n \nCharlie Therapeutic [cloning], I can maybe understand it. If you get to that\u2026 and \nyou\u2026you do arrest it and it has to be at that stem cell stage\u2026If you arrest the \ndevelopment, I can see the\u2026Yes, I can see that. \nKerry But the population is just going to\u2026if\u2026if\u2026if it is successful, what is going to \nhappen to everybody that is actually on the planet and the planet? I mean, it\u2019s  \njust going to\u2026 \nCharlie I think if we go back 100 years\u2026 \nKerry  There has to be a natural selection of people or animals. \n(Focus group 5) \n \nHuman cloning also featured in the media data. The first major news story in the relevant \ntime period of the data collection was the claim by the US fertility expert Dr Panos Zavos to \nhave transferred a cloned human embryo into a woman. The second was the report in the \njournal Science (Hwang, Ryu, Park, Park, Lee, Koo et al., 2004) on the work of a Korean \nteam led by Dr Woo Suk Hwang, which claimed to have extracted stem cells from cloned \nhuman blastocysts. While the coverage of the claim by Dr Zavos portrayed him as a maverick \nscientist, this latter story was much more scientifically credible. (Note that subsequently there \nhas been controversy surrounding the work of Dr Hwang, who has been accused of scientific \nfraud, which led to his resignation in December 2005 (Wohn, 2006). However, at the time of \nthe media analysis reported here, there was no suggestion that there might be problems with \nthis stem cell research and hence this was not reflected in the media analysis.)  \n \nAnalysis1 of the reporting of research on human cloning revealed that the perceived agenda, \nmotivations and credibility of individual scientists were key for the overall stance taken in \nmedia reports of human cloning work. At the same time questions of the purpose of cloning, \nthe status of the embryo and the risks of such interventions in \u2018natural processes\u2019 were also \nsignificant framings for the media discourse. There was considerable ambivalence in the \nmedia reports with some articles containing both pro- and anti- representations. However, a \nmoral contrast emerged across the articles between reproductive cloning being positioned as \ngenerally a bad thing and therapeutic cloning being generally good, although not without its \nrisks for the future, as also found by Petersen (2001) in analysis of Australian media \ncoverage. Both pro- and anti- positions were shored up by use of \u2018science\u2019 claims, and the \ncontested status of the stem cell (as human life or as merely blastocyst) persisted as an \nimportant pivot point for the articulation of different discourses.  \n \nMedia coverage of the Korean stem cell research generally emphasised the differences \nbetween therapeutic and reproductive cloning, partly portraying the difference in terms of \ncurrent scientific ability to produce an embryo from a stem cell line. This locates the \n 10 \ndifference as one of technique but a careful move is made in the quotation below to use the \ndiscourse of scientific precision which avoids the moral rhetoric of embryos as human. \nIndeed the \u2018big step\u2019 from stem cell line (and early blastocyst) closes down the possibility of \nsuch a moral challenge.  \n \n\"Nobody has cloned a human here,\" said Donald Kennedy, a biologist and editor in \nchief of Science, which published the study today\u2026\"All they have done is create a stem \ncell line from an early blastocyst\u2026To get from that to an embryo is a big step.\" \n(Guardian, Feb 13) \n \nMedia reports on claims of cloning drew clear and consistent distinctions between using \ncloning technology for reproductive purposes, exemplified by the Panos Zavos case and \ncriticised by scientists and others as immoral, and for therapeutic purposes, exemplified by \nthe Korean team which was presented as morally justified and offering significant benefits:  \n \nCloning for reproductive purposes would\u2026be wholly reprehensible\u2026What good \nreason could anyone ever have for wishing to clone him or herself?...In fact the South \nKoreans have cloned an embryo with quite other reasons in mind. They wish to do \nfurther stem-cell research, which (it is hoped) will one day allow us to grow human \ncells that can be artificially stimulated into becoming special tissues\u2026to replace those \ndamaged in a disease process. (Daily Telegraph, Feb 13) \n \nHowever, critics of cloning argued that this distinction was artificial and that, once \ntherapeutic cloning is accepted, reproductive cloning would inevitably follow. The recurrent \nmetaphor here, as in the focus groups, was the \u2018slippery slope\u2019 as implied in the Daily \nTelegraph headline on February 13th \u2013 \u2018Human cells cloned: babies next?\u2019 However, \nadvocates for therapeutic cloning also invoked this metaphor more directly as a rhetorical \nresource that counters potential criticism:  \n \nThe moral distinction between therapeutic and reproductive cloning boils down to the \npurpose for which the embryo is used\u2026The distinction between therapeutic and \nreproductive cloning breaks down, because it is artificial. Once human cloning becomes \naccepted, it is perfectly conceivable that foetus farming and eugenics will follow. (Daily \nTelegraph, Feb 13) \n \nThere is, of course, the slippery slope argument, and it is certainly true that there have \nbeen many such slopes down which we have slipped, or joyously skied, in the past few \ndecades. But unless we believe that we are not masters of our fate\u2026this is not a slope \nwe need slip down, at least with proper regulation. (Daily Telegraph , Feb 13) \n \nUnderlying values and beliefs \n \nAnalysis of all the data sets indicated that attitudes towards cloning were underpinned by a \nvariety of values and beliefs. Using the survey data, it is possible to examine the strength of \nrelationship between these values and public attitudes in the context of other known \ninfluential variables such as age, gender and education. The focus group data reveal the \nsignificance at a micro-level of certain orientations towards \u2018the embryo\u2019 and \u2018interference \nwith nature\u2019, themes that also emerge from the media analysis.  \n \n 11 \nIn order to examine the impact of underlying values on attitudes to cloning in the survey data, \na single cloning attitude scale was calculated by summing the four cloning items, three \ntherapeutic and one reproductive (Cronbach\u2019s alpha = .81). As part of the survey, there was \nalso a series of six questions on values in relation to science. Factor analysis of these items \nyielded three factors: the first comprised three items concerning the effects of human \nintervention on nature and justification of the means to an end (alpha = .53); the second factor \ncomprised two items associated with the risks and benefits of scientific intervention (alpha = \n.62) and the final factor was a single item focusing on public perceptions of the fragility of \nnature. In each case, responses were coded so that a positive value represented a pro-science \nstance.  \n \nA multiple regression was carried out predicting people\u2019s overall attitude towards human \ncloning using dummy variables for religious affiliation and entering the three science and \nnature values as continuous scores. Respondent gender, age and highest educational \nqualification were also included. The results of this regression are shown in Table 3. On the \nfirst step, gender, age, education and religion were entered. The results show that a positive \nattitude to human cloning is associated with younger age and men, whilst those with a higher \nlevel of education are least likely to have a favourable view of this technology. None of the \nvariables for religious affiliation were statistically significant in the model. This contrasts \nwith the finding that two of the three values items were significant in predicting attitude to \nhuman cloning; both were consistent with a more favourable attitude among those with \nvalues that can be characterised as pro-scientific intervention and human progress in the \nnatural world. \n \nValues as resources  \n \nWhilst the survey data allowed for an examination of the relationship between specified value \nvariables and people\u2019s attitudes, the \u2018open\u2019 approach of the focus groups allowed a range of \nvalues and beliefs to emerge in discussion. Participants used what we termed \u2018front-line\u2019 \nresources early in the discussion to frame their views. On the other hand, some formulations \nof views served as \u2018bottom-line\u2019 resources in that they closed down the possibility of further \ndiscussion on the issue for that individual and at times for the other participants interacting \nwith that individual.  \n \nThe issue of interference with nature and the status of the embryo \u2013 the two most frequently \ndrawn upon \u2018values\u2019 or \u2018beliefs\u2019 \u2013 are discursive resources commonly invoked in arguments \nagainst the permissibility of cloning technologies per se. Typically, they are drawn upon \nearly in such discussions and may be interpreted as means by which further discussions of the \npermissibility of cloning technologies may be closed down. Thus they may be interpreted as \nboth \u2018front-line\u2019 and, potentially, \u2018bottom-line\u2019 rhetorical resources. An example of \n\u2018interfering with nature\u2019 talk is provided below: \n \nArchie Is that not really what you\u2019re\u2026what we\u2019re all talking about the fundamental \nproblem of interfering with nature. There\u2019s always been that argument with \nscience. \nGabi  Yes, but they could spend the money on better things. \nArchie Just leave things alone. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. You know, the \nFrankenstein thing. What\u2026? You\u2019re interfering with nature. You\u2019re playing \nGod. \n(Focus group 7) \n 12 \n \nAlthough both of these positions could operate as \u2018bottom lines\u2019, \u2018interfering with nature\u2019 \nwas not as robust in curtailing further discussion as invocations of the status of the embryo. \nWhilst an individual might indicate they were opposed to (or very cautious about) cloning on \nthe basis that it was interfering with nature or that the embryo was actually a human life, the \nformer was more frequently challenged by other participants. Typically, these contestations \nof cautions against \u2018interfering with nature\u2019 were based on the questioning of the historical \nand cultural stability of the concept of nature; nature itself was made a contested resource. \nAlthough the \u2018interfering with nature\u2019 trope did not prove to be an effective bottom-line \nresource, it was nonetheless highly resilient, recurring in reworked ways within and across \nthe focus group discussions.  \n \nAlthough the more effective bottom line resource involving the invocation of the status of the \nembryo could be interpreted as part of broader religious beliefs, this resource was typically \nlocated within a framework of the sanctity of human life (rather than within explicitly \nreligious frameworks), where the concept of human life extended as far back as the moment \nof conception. Examples of conversational turns in which the status of the embryo was \ninvoked are provided below: \n \nPaige I think the major issue with stem cell research is where the stem cells come \nfrom, whether it\u2019s taken from a fetus. They have banks of embryos which \naren\u2019t used from IVF treatment. That\u2019s where they take them from and \nwhether that\u2019s morally right or wrong. That\u2019s really the issue. \n(Focus group 2) \n \nMegan That\u2019s absolutely fine if they take your own stem cells but taking embryonic \nstem cells I don\u2019t think is right. \n[ ] \nWell, they\u2019re experimenting on embryos at the moment to extract their stem \ncells and then the thing dies, basically. \nAmy  Not fully-grown embryos. \nMegan  It\u2019s still human life, isn\u2019t it? \n(Focus group 1) \n \nGrace I mean, if they could create something that is far removed from a human \nbeing, nothing to do with the sperm fertilising the egg or whatever, and it\u2019s  \nfine by me but that\u2019s my issue that really. \n(Focus group 3) \n \nInvocations of the status of the embryo and the sanctity of human life functioned to exempt \nspeakers from further more complex discussions of the permissibility of cloning technologies \nand other embryological research.  \n \nThe media analysis also indicated the centrality of values relating to the status of the embryo \n(Williams et al., 2003). In the media reports of the Korean stem cell research, critics of \ncloning argued that embryos were human beings and hence should be accorded the rights \nappropriate to human beings. Advocates of the technology, on the other hand, argued that \nembryos cannot be equated with human life as it is usually understood. For example: \n \n 13 \nOnce the clones are created, they are dismembered and their cells used to grow (we \nhope) spare parts for treating patients. Clearly that is anything but \u201ctherapeutic\u201d for the \nclone embryo. So the question should be: can we treat some people if the process \ninvolves killing others? [ ] But are embryos really human beings? Scientists admit \nhuman life begins at the embryo stage. The embryo has rights. Are all human beings \nequal, or are some more equal than others? (Sun, Feb 13) \n \nHowever, for myself, I cannot truly consider an embryo a full member of the human \nrace. I cannot mourn for its loss as for say, the death of a six year-old child, nor can I \nfeel the same outrage at its deliberately induced demise as for an old lady brutally done \nto death in her own home [ ] Indeed, if anyone claimed to be able to do so, I should \nthink him either a humbug or madman. (Opinion, Daily Telegraph, Feb 13) \n \nIn some cases, the distinction was made between embryos and blastocysts in order to try to \novercome this problem:  \n \nTo say that scientists have cloned human embryos is in itself misleading. We are talking \nabout bundles of cells known as blastocysts which are far from being actual embryos. \n(Daily Mail, Feb 15)  \n \nThe status of the embryo as \u2018human\u2019 is thus a powerful construction invoked both by focus \ngroup participants and by newspaper journalists and opinion writers when discussing research \ninto cloning. In both cases, the construction of the embryo as a human being shuts off any \nacceptance of cloning. Moves to resist this foreclosure on acceptability generally involved \nrepositioning embryos as something not human (as blastocysts). \n \nThe media accounts also drew on wider socio-political contexts. This served to discursively \nposition cloning as an issue with nation-state dimensions. It also drew on familiar discourses \nof the role of the \u2018moral right\u2019 in preventing the advance of science in the USA and parallel \nreligious movements in the UK which aim to have the same impact. The position in the UK \non therapeutic cloning was contrasted with that in the USA, especially President Bush\u2019s \nopposition on moral grounds. Advocates of the technology used the rhetorical strategy of \nlinking opposition to the \u2018moral right\u2019 and to a wide ranging \u2018anti-science\u2019 position:  \n \nI am dismayed that any discussion of cloning inevitably becomes dominated by the \ndoommongers, often, conservative Christians who are anti-abortion, anti-IVF and anti-\ncontraception. Those who accuse scientists of playing God invariably believe God \nbelongs to them alone. They would deny the rest of us any choice over these matters. \nThe Bush administration, for instance, has outlawed federal funding for stem-cell \nresearch. America, in its current incarnation, is a fundamentalist culture which also \nrefuses to teach the theory of evolution in some of its schools. We are not such a \nculture. (Daily Mail, Feb 15) \n \nThe linking of this alliance between \u2018conservative Christians\u2019 and those who are \u2018anti-\nscience\u2019 to characteristics of nation-state politics served to position the UK as forward \nthinking but as not immune to the risks that this constructed alliance was said to pose. \n \nReligion  \n \n 14 \nWhile religion might be expected to be a major issue in determining people\u2019s responses to \nhuman cloning (Evans, 2002), religious affiliation it did not emerge from the various analyses \nas playing a major role. For example, as described earlier, religious affiliation did not play a \nsignificant role in the prediction of attitudes to cloning as assessed in the survey (Table 3).  \n \nCloser inspection of the survey data did, however, reveal some religious differences in the \nstrength of responses to each of the four cloning items (Table 4). Roman Catholic \nrespondents in particular were more negative about cloning for any of the purposes specified. \nOne third held strongly negative views about human cloning for reproductive purposes and \npeople of this denomination were approximately twice as likely as those with no religion to \nobject to human cloning for medical purposes. \n \nIn the vignette study, there were no differences in attitude to cloning between participants \nwho attended religious services on a regular basis and those who did not. Participants who \nregarded themselves as belonging to a particular religion were more likely to agree that \ncloning threatens the natural order of things (Mean=3.85, sd=1.08) than participants who did \nnot (Mean=3.56, sd=1.19; t(344.22)=2.39, p<.05). However, these two groups did not differ \non the other three attitudes to cloning items.  \n \nReligion was not specifically identified by participants in the focus groups to explain why \nthey held certain views or offered particular opinions in the discussion about cloning. \nHowever, references to concerns about \u2018interfering with nature\u2019 or to the status of the \nembryo\/the \u2018sanctity of life\u2019 were occasionally positioned in terms of a generic \u2018God\u2019 or \ncould be understood as drawing on discourses and resources associated with religion and \nreligious belief.  \n \nDiscussion and conclusion \n \nOverall the research presents a complex picture of attitudes to and constructions of human \ncloning among the British public. It certainly does not present a uniform rejection of cloning \nin any form but rather presents a nuanced picture of variations across types of applications \nand differences in conclusions depending on the methods used.  \n \nThe quantitative data from both the survey and vignette study are in line with previous \nsurveys, which have shown more positive attitudes towards therapeutic than reproductive \ncloning (Calnan et al., 2005). The approval of reproductive cloning in the present study is \nrather higher than that found by Calnan et al. (2005), although differences in the questions \nasked and the way they were framed do not allow a direct comparison.  \n \nThese results contrast with those from the focus groups where the participants were much \nmore negative about cloning overall. This might partly be explained by the initial assumption \nwithin the groups that cloning referred to reproductive cloning and that they could see no real \nbenefits from this type of procedure, while seeing many objections. However, even when the \nconcept of therapeutic cloning was introduced, although this was accepted to a greater extent, \nreservations were still expressed. There are a number of possible reasons for these apparent \ndiscrepancies. One possibility is that the wording of the question in the survey \u2018\u2026 to treat a \nyoung couple\u2026\u2019, along with the positioning of this question following the three questions on \ntherapeutic cloning, may have served to situate this question as one of medical treatment \nrather than emphasising the creation of a human being from cloning. Against this \ninterpretation, the results from the vignette study, using a different question and context, also \n 15 \nyielded rather stronger approval for reproductive cloning than might be inferred from the \nfocus groups.  \n \nIt is noteworthy that the results of these focus groups in some respects chime well with those \nobtained in the Wellcome Trust groups some six years earlier (Wellcome Trust, 1998). \nParticipants were generally negative about cloning, assumed that cloning meant reproductive \ncloning and also, whilst initially being more positive about therapeutic cloning, went on to \nexpress a range of reservations.  \n \nThere are of course issues of how representative the samples are in the different studies \nreported. We can be confident of the sample from the British Social Attitudes survey being \nreasonably representative of the British public. However, as with all smaller scale qualitative \nresearch, the focus groups cannot be said to be truly representative but care was taken to \nensure that group participants reflected the demographic profile of the group location and to \navoid recruiting individuals who might have an explicit, identifiable agenda to pursue. The \nprovision of financial incentives was also designed to draw a wide range of participants to the \ngroups.  \n \nIt is not necessarily surprising that the quantitative research and focus groups yielded \ndifferent results in this case and it is of course not possible to say that one data source was \n\u2018correct\u2019. The survey and the vignette study asked people to respond to relatively simple \nquestions without the need to interact with other people who might have opposing views or \nthe need to defend one\u2019s own views in public. Participants are sensitive to the presence or \nabsence of cues provided by the research environment itself (Schwartz and Sudman, 1992; \nHoutkoop-Steenstra, 2000) and the predetermined and constrained response options in the \nquantitative research provides quite a different sense making context from the wide ranging \ndiscussion in focus groups. While the focus groups are useful for capturing the type of \ndiscourse in this context, the quantitative research yields both more representative data and \nmay also reveal what people believe themselves but might find difficult to articulate in a \npublic discussion. Using a variety of methods allows the examination of areas where there is \ngood agreement between methods but also allows insights into areas of disagreement.  \n \nBoth in relation to the comparison of therapeutic and reproductive cloning and other aspects \nof the analysis, there is a marked similarity between the types of discourse in the focus \ngroups and the media analysis. This includes the use of similar phrases and rhetorical devices, \ne.g. \u2018the slippery slope\u2019 from therapeutic to reproductive cloning. This is not surprising since \nmost of the information on cloning that members of the public will have encountered will \nhave been obtained from the media (Miller & Riechert, 2000) and it supports the assertion by \nPetersen (2001) that the media coverage in this area is likely \u2018to exert a powerful influence on \npublic responses\u2019. Alternatively it can be interpreted as the media being well attuned to the \nnature of public beliefs\/feelings in this area and reflecting these in the coverage.  \n \nAttitudes were shown to be related to underlying values related to scientific progress to a \ngreater extent than to age, gender, education or religion. There were some differences in the \nquantitative data based on religious affiliation but overall religion was not closely related to \nthe expressed attitudes. Likewise in the focus groups there was little direct appeal to religion, \nalthough the major rhetorical resources employed to object to cloning could be understood as \ndrawing upon discourses associated with religion and religious belief.  \n \n 16 \nThe morality of cloning was very prominent across the different methods and this differs \nfrom other technological science developments which may simply be seen as amazing or \nunnecessary. Cloning, however, evokes consideration of what it is to be human, human \nidentity, scientists losing their moral compass in pursuit of the fascinating. In discussion it \nwas clear that certain claims or statements relating to the sanctity of nature and the status of \nthe embryo were used to foreclose further discussion.  \n \nOverall the findings demonstrate the complexity of public views in this area. In many cases \nthe findings from the different methods are complementary, offering either confirmation of a \nfinding or providing more insight than would be possible if using a single method and, in \nthose cases where there is less agreement, giving an insight into the complexity of the views \nheld in this area.  \n \n \n  \n 17 \nReferences \n \nBates, B.

The present paper reports on a series of studies examining \npublic attitudes to human cloning, bringing together a range of quantitative and qualitative \nmethods to address this question. These included a nationally representative survey, an \nexperimental vignette study, focus groups and analyses of media coverage. In all of the \nanalyses therapeutic cloning was viewed more favourably than was reproductive cloning. \nHowever, while participants in the focus groups were generally negative about both forms of \ncloning, and this was also reflected in the media analyses, quantitative results showed more \npositive responses. In the quantitative research, therapeutic cloning was generally accepted \nwhen the benefits of such procedures were clear and although reproductive cloning was less \naccepted there was still substantial support. Participants in the focus groups only \ndifferentiated between therapeutic and reproductive cloning after the issue of therapeutic \ncloning was explicitly raised; initially they saw cloning as being reproductive cloning and \nsaw no real benefits. Attitudes were shown to be related to underlying values related to \nscientific progress rather than to age, gender or education, and although there were a few \ndifferences in the quantitative data based on religious affiliation, these tended to be small \neffects. Likewise in the focus groups there was little direct appeal to religion but the main \nthemes were \u2018interfering with nature\u2019 and the \u2018status of the embryo\u2019, with the latter being \nused more effectively to try to close down further discussion. In general there was a close \ncorrespondence between the media analysis and focus group responses, possibly \ndemonstrating the importance of media as a resource or that the media reflect public \ndiscourse accurately. However, focus group responses did not simply reflect media coverage. \n \nAbstract word count: 293 \n \nKeywords: UK, human cloning, attitude, focus groups, media analysis, survey \n \nFull word count: 10961 \n 3\nIntroduction \n \nIn the post-genomic era, the growing capability of scientists to apply cloning technology to \nhuman embryos has prompted widespread media reporting and discussion \u2013 most \ncontroversially over claims that a human clone had been born (e.g. Guardian, 2003). \nAlthough these claims were widely discredited, it is true that today the cloning of human \ngenetic material can no longer be seen as the domain of science fiction. Unlike many other \ncountries including the USA, the cloning of human cells has been legally sanctioned in the \nUK for the purposes of medical research (\u2018therapeutic cloning\u2019). However, at the same time, \nspecific legislation has been developed to outlaw reproductive cloning, where a cloned \nhuman embryo is implanted and allowed to develop to full term (HMSO, 2001). \n \nCloning is the technique of creating an identical copy of an organism from its genetic \nmaterial using the technique of cell nuclear replacement (MRC, 2002). A distinction is made \n- at least in law - between therapeutic or research cloning and reproductive cloning. The \nformer harvests special cells called stem cells which, at the early embryonic stage of \ndevelopment, have a unique ability to divide and differentiate into a range of body tissues. As \nstem cells from a cloned embryo will be genetically compatible with their donor, their \npotential benefits lie in medical therapy for a range of diseases and degenerative conditions. \nIn reproductive cloning, the same technique is used to create a human embryo that is then \nallowed to develop into a baby that is an identical genetic match to the donor. \n \nThe debate around human cloning has a long history (e.g. Warnock, 1984) but much of the \nmore recent discussions have followed the cloning of Dolly the sheep (Wilmut et al., 1997), \ne.g. UK House of Commons Science and Technology Committee report (1997) and the \nconsultation on Cloning Issues in Reproduction, Science and Medicine launched in 1998 by \nthe Human Genetics Advisory Commission (HGAC) and the Human Fertilisation and \nEmbryology Authority (HFEA) in the UK. This has been mirrored by international debates \non this topic and in 2005 the vote by the United Nations for a non-binding ban on all forms of \ncloning, although this has not prevented research on therapeutic cloning in some countries, \ne.g. the UK.  \n \nMuch of the controversy and debate surrounding human cloning for both therapeutic and \nreproductive purposes centres on moral and ethical issues around the creation of a human \nembryo. A key issue in the debate surrounding therapeutic cloning is under what \ncircumstances, if any, can it be considered acceptable to end one life \u2013 that of the embryo - \nwith the objective of saving another (Reiss, 2002). Clearly there are many different ways of \nconceptualising the value of human life at different stages and hence resolving such questions \nis far from straightforward. Exactly when in its development should a human embryo be \naccorded human rights and protection? This issue is hotly debated within ethical and religious \ncontexts (for example, see McCarthy, 2003) and is unlikely ever to be resolved, although \nadvisory bodies generally acknowledge that there are specific circumstances where using \nstem cells from human embryos can be justified by the potential health benefits arising from \nthe research. \n \nA subsidiary set of arguments around human cloning arises from the connections between \ntherapeutic and reproductive cloning (Bowring, 2004). The reasoning behind what may be \ntermed the \u2018slippery slope\u2019 argument is that advances on therapeutic applications of cloning \nwill inevitably lead to reproductive cloning, regardless of its legal status. \n \n 4\nA number of large scale surveys report positive attitudes among the public towards science \nand new scientific developments (Gaskell, Allum & Stares, 2003b; MORI, 2005) but the \nsame sources typically reveal considerable public scepticism about the motivations of \nscientists, and about the science and the application of new technologies. Certainly for \ngenetic science there are particular public concerns about privacy, ethics and tampering with \nnature (Calnan, Montaner & Horne, 2005).  \n  \nCalnan et al. (2005) surveyed members of the public in England and Wales about their \nattitudes to new health care technologies, science and trust in health care practitioners. A \nscenario on reproductive human cloning was used based on an infertile couple participating \nin a clinical trial to have a baby. Only 12 percent accepted that the couple should participate \nin the trial compared with 68 percent who rejected it. Other scenarios based on non-\nembryonic stem cell therapy and genetic screening were received much more favourably, \nleading the authors to conclude that support for genetic technologies is heavily dependent on \nits stated purpose.  \n \nBates et al. (2005) report that polls in the USA from 1998 to 2002 show that 66% to 90% of \nthe American public indicated that embryonic, animal and human cloning were unacceptable. \nLikewise, Gaskell, Allum, Bauer, Jackson, Howard & Lindsey (2003a) found the usefulness \nof cloning human cells to be rated around the \u2018tend to agree\u2019 mark. Nisbet (2004) reviewed a \nnumber of public opinion polls in the USA and while cloning was generally not accepted the \nresults were highly dependent upon the application; in a 1998 survey approval was highest \nfor the application of \u2018infertility\u2019 with 33% approving and there was a 20% approval in a \n2002 survey for the application \u2018infertile couples\u2019 (Nisbet, 2004). Other US surveys between \n1997 and 2002 gave between 9 and 11% agreeing that the cloning of humans should be \nallowed, where the application was reproductive (Nisbet, 2004). Likewise, a 2001 survey \ngave 11% of people agreeing that reproductive cloning should be legal whereas 33% felt that \nit should be legal to clone humans for medical treatments (Nisbet, 2004). Surveys where it \nwas explicit that the cloning would not result in the birth of a human being (but rather were \nfor research or medical treatments) gave between 34% and 59% approving the application \n(Nisbet, 2004). Simpson and Edwards (2002) likewise comment on a Harris poll conducted in \n2001, where 76% rejected reproductive cloning, as showing less objection than might be \npredicted from the positions taken by official organizations and investigators.  \n \nIn 2005, an online survey in the UK by YouGov questioned over 2000 adults about cloning \nand embryo research (YouGov, 2005). A total of 66 percent agreed that \u2018the rights of the \npatient are more important than the embryo\u2019, with only 15 percent disagreeing with this \nstatement. A majority of 58 percent endorsed the view that embryos are not really human \nbeings from the moment of conception but believe that their use should be governed by law. \nJust over one quarter found therapeutic cloning acceptable using embryonic stem cells to treat \ndisease, but a much lower proportion found it acceptable for cosmetic purposes. \nApproximately 6 in 10 people thought that scientists give too little thought to the moral issues \ninvolved.  \n \nA UK qualitative study using reconvened focus groups by the Wellcome Trust (1998) \nconcluded that participants were overwhelmingly against cloning and that the provision of \ninformation about cloning did little to modify reactions of shock, concern and fear around the \ntechnology. While most of the participants were familiar with the idea of reproductive \ncloning they lacked any prior knowledge of therapeutic cloning.  \n \n 5\nPrevious analyses of media coverage in this area have also highlighted the distinction made \nbetween therapeutic cloning as \u2018good\u2019 and reproductive cloning as \u2018bad\u2019 (Petersen, 2001) and \nalso examined the types of rhetorical devices used in the debate surrounding the use of stem \ncells and contrasting views of future developments (Kitzinger and Williams, 2005). Media \nanalysis on other genetic issues has shown differences in the construction of the \u2018gay gene\u2019 \nbetween the US media, where this was presented as good science and treated with caution \noptimism, and the UK media which presented the research as the \u2018perils of the gay gene\u2019 \n(Conrad and Markens, 2001). The media is expected to be a major source of public \nunderstanding of genetics and a strong influence on public discourse (Conrad, 2001), \nalthough neither Conrad (2001) nor Conrad and Markens (2001) empirically examined the \nrelationship between media coverage and public understanding or attitude. Some have argued \nthat the public receive an overly deterministic view of genetic science from the media (e.g. \nNelkin and Lindee, 1995) but others have questioned the extent to which this impacts on the \npublic (Condit, 1999; Bates, 2005). The interpretation of information in the media is far from \na linear acceptance of the views expressed but rather the target audience interpret the \ninformation in complex ways and are active rather than passive in the ways in which they use \nmedia information (Condit, 1999). In addition to print and broadcast media, there are other \nsources in popular culture which may have an impact on public views, e.g. science fiction and \nmovies (Biotechnology Australia, 2006). The present paper examines media coverage over \nthe same period as the reported empirical studies of public attitudes but does not directly \naddress the impact of media reporting on attitude but rather it seeks to present the media \ncoverage as one form of resource upon which the public can draw in arriving at views on \nhuman cloning.  \n \nWhile provoking strong opinions among many, public surveys and consultation exercises \nabout human cloning show that attitudes vary according to its stated purpose, perceived \nutility and morality (e.g. Bates, Lynch, Bevan, & Condit, 2005; Gaskell, Allum, Bauer, \nJackson, Howard & Lindsey, 2003a; Gaskell et al., 2003b; HFEA, 1998). It is often \nuncertain, however, to what extent public opinion is influenced by the media environment at \nany given time or the manner and context in which questions about human cloning are asked. \nHow the potential harms and benefits of cloning are presented arguably has a direct impact \non the level of public support found in opinion polls (Genetics and Public Policy Center, \n2005; Nisbet, 2004). Public responses to human cloning must also be seen in the context of \nthe current socio-political climate; for example, recent research indicates that although some \ntypes of scientist continue to be considered as valuable sources of scientific information and \nadvice about science, there are growing public concerns that the independence of scientists \nmay be compromised by the interests of their funders and the commercialisation of such \nfunding (MORI, 2005). Commercialisation has also been identified as one of the possible \nreasons for the \u2018hyping\u2019 of genetic science in the media (Caulfield, 2004). These concerns \nmay well have been further intensified by the recent highly visible controversy around \nfalsification of scientific data in this area (Wohn, 2006). \n \nThis brief overview of research exploring public perceptions and understandings of cloning \ndepicts a somewhat fragmented set of findings largely derived from studies using single \nmethods and ranging over a period of years over which there has been considerable \ndevelopments both in the science and in the accompanying media coverage.  \n \nThis paper reports multi-method research on public attitudes towards new genetic \ntechnologies in the UK. Drawing on both quantitative and qualitative data affords us a unique \nopportunity to investigate the nature, spread and strength of opinion among the British \n 6\npopulation and the resources and reasoning used by people to make judgements about this \ngenetic technology. We are able to locate our empirical findings in the context of media \nreporting of human cloning over the same time period, helping to provide a rounded and \ncurrent picture of human cloning as a public issue.  \n \nMethod \n \nThe data reported here were collected as part of a large study on attitudes to genomics which \ncomprised several separate elements. Data are reported from two quantitative pieces of work, \na national survey and an experimental vignette study, and two qualitative elements, a focus \ngroup study and media analyses. Each of these pieces of work was conducted separately and \nthere was no overlap in participants between the different pieces of work. The methods for \neach strand of work are described briefly below.  \n \nSurvey \n \nQuestions on human cloning were administered as self-completion items on the British Social \nAttitudes Survey, an annual survey of social and political attitudes in the UK that was \nconducted between June and September 2003. This yielded a nationally representative sample \nof approximately 2500 adults aged 18 and above. The key questions in the survey for the \npurposes of this paper are four questions on attitudes to cloning for different purposes. The \nfirst three were on therapeutic cloning for different purposes and were preceded by a short \npreamble: \n \nYou might have heard of something called human cloning. One type of cloning would be \nif a person\u2019s genes were copied exactly and used to make an embryo. Cells from the \nembryo could be used to supply the person with tissues or organs that would be a \nperfect match for them, meaning their body would not reject them. Do you think this \nshould be allowed or not allowed for if a person \u2026?  \n1. .. needs an organ transplant \n2. .. needs treatment for Parkinson\u2019s Disease \n3. .. is generally in good health and wants to live longer \n \nWe also asked one question on reproductive human cloning:  \n \nAnother type of human cloning might be used to treat a young couple who are infertile \nand cannot have a child. Suppose that the genes from one of them were copied exactly \nand used to make an embryo with exactly the same genetic make up as that parent. Do \nyou think this should be allowed or not allowed \u2026?  \n \nFor further details about the design of this survey and the questions used see Park, Curtice, \nThomson, Bromley & Phillips (2004) and in particular Sturgis, Cooper, Fife-Schaw & \nShepherd (2004). \n \nVignette study \n \nParticipants in the vignette study comprised 368 adult members of the British general public \nwho were categorised as having either high or low trust in science. The study was carried out \nbetween May and September 2004. The groups were selected on the basis of agreement or \ndisagreement with the item \u201cThose in charge of new developments in genetic science cannot \n 7\nbe trusted to act in society\u2019s interests\u201d. Participants completed a baseline questionnaire \nassessing demographic and attitudinal variables and were then randomly assigned to receive \none of four vignettes. Therapeutic cloning was described in the vignettes in the following \nway: \u2018One use of cloning involves taking special cells, called stem-cells, from cloned \nembryos. These cells could then be used to help treat disease in the person who donated their \ngenetic material, for example, to grow replacement body tissues or organs.\u2019 Reproductive \ncloning was described as follows: \u2018One use of cloning involves placing the cloned embryo \ninto a woman\u2019s womb so that it grows into a new human being.\u2019 \nThe vignettes described either therapeutic or reproductive cloning and contained either \narguments in favour of banning the technology outright or allowing it under regulated \nconditions. Thus the study had a two (therapeutic versus reproductive cloning) by two \n(arguments for banning or arguments for controlling the technology) between-subjects \nfactorial design. Participants then completed follow-up questions on their attitudes towards \nthe situation described in the vignette and cloning in general. For the present analysis the four \nitems of interest are: \n \n1. Cloning, as described, should be banned \n2. Cloning, as described, should be allowed under certain circumstances \n3. Cloning technology threatens the natural order of things \n4. Cloning technology poses no threat to future generations \n \nResponse options ranged from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The vignettes and \nthe questionnaire are available from the authors on request.  \n \nFocus groups \n \nThe focus group study was carried out between July 2004 and April 2005 and involved ten \ngroups which (potentially) addressed the issue of cloning. Eight were conducted at six \nlocations in England, Scotland and Wales with members of the general public who had no \nparticular involvement or investment in genomics-related issues. Four addressed health-\nrelated technologies; four did not focus on specific applications. Group members were \nrecruited by a fieldwork agency to reflect the demographic profile of the populations in the \nvarious group locations. Two additional focus group interviews were conducted with people \naffected by genetic disease, who were recruited through the Clinical Genetics Department of \na London hospital. The eight general public groups consisted of 80 individuals and the two \ngroups of people affected by genetic disease consisted of 12 individuals. Participants were \npaid an incentive of \u00a335 to take part.  \n \nEach focus group was facilitated by two moderators, using an interview schedule which, \namong other issues, invited participants to identify the developments in (health-related) \ngenetic technologies that they had heard about or encountered and to describe what they had \nheard, what their reactions have been and how they evaluate the acceptability of these \ntechnologies. In relation to cloning, if participants did not distinguish between reproductive \nand therapeutic cloning, the interviewers provided definitions of these technologies in line \nwith the definitions outlined previously and then asked participants about their responses.  \n \nInterviews were transcribed, coded in terms of content using N-Vivo and then subjected to an \nintegrative form of discourse analysis that attended to both relatively micro-level and macro-\nsocial features of talk (Wetherell, 1998) in order to identify the ways in which and the basis \non which \u2018attitudes\u2019 and \u2018knowledges\u2019 relevant to cloning are constructed and worked with. \n 8\nHowever, space constraints mean that, in this paper, findings from the focus group studies are \npresented more as the outcome of a social constructionist version of thematic analysis (Joff\u00e9 \n& Yardley, 2004) rather than in the level of detail normally expected in discourse analysis. \n \nMedia analyses \n \nA qualitative analysis of genomics-related texts was conducted on data drawn from \nnewspaper articles from six UK newspapers (the Times, the Guardian, the Daily Telegraph, \nthe Daily Mail, the Sun, and the Daily Mirror) during a 3-month monitoring period (12 \nJanuary \u2013 11 April 2004, inclusive). A total of 1340 articles were included in the analysis \nwith the following split between the newspapers: Times 450, Guardian 447, Daily Telegraph \n159, Daily Mail 108, Sun 94 and Daily Mirror 82. The analysis followed the same type of \nprocess as for the focus groups above and the results are presented in the same form as the \noutcome of a social constructionist version of thematic analysis (Joff\u00e9 & Yardley, 2004) \nrather than in the level of detail normally expected in discourse analysis. \n \nResults \n \nThe following results are presented under two themes which emerged from the analysis of the \ndifferent types of data: the distinction between cloning for therapeutic or reproductive ends \nand values and beliefs underlying attitudes to cloning. In each case, results are presented from \ndifferent pieces of research in order to illustrate the contribution of each method to addressing \nthese general issues; given space constraints, it is not possible to present all of the relevant \nfindings from any one of the methods.  \n \nTherapeutic versus reproductive cloning \n \nEach of the data sets provides some insights into the nature of the distinction between \ntherapeutic and reproductive cloning. The survey and experimental data show that the \ninformation provided around the purpose of cloning were clearly related to judgements of \nvarious applications. Interestingly the focus group discussions indicated that when people are \nleft to their own devices they do not spontaneously differentiate these two facets. Both the \nfocus group discussions and the media analysis show the use of the \u2018slippery slope\u2019 metaphor \n(Bowring, 2004) affords a way of framing considerations of therapeutic and reproductive \ncloning. \n \nAnalysis of the survey data suggests that obvious benefit is important for the attitudes the \ngeneral public express towards therapeutic cloning.  The purpose of such cloning research \nclearly had an impact on the attitudes people expressed. Survey respondents were strongly in \nfavour of cloning where the benefits were clear (for an organ transplant or for Parkinson\u2019s \ndisease) but not where cloning was simply to prolong the life of a healthy individual (see \nTable 1). Although responses were more mixed when the application was reproductive, \nnonetheless a substantial number of people (38%) felt that it should definitely or probably be \nallowed (Table 1).  \n \nAs in the survey, the respondents in the vignette study were more positive towards \ntherapeutic cloning than they were towards reproductive cloning (Table 2). This was \nparticularly true for the questions directly related to the form of cloning \u2018as described\u2019 in the \nvignette but was also apparent for the questions which asked about cloning without \nspecifically referring to the vignette.  \n 9\n \nIn contrast, explicit distinctions between reproductive and therapeutic cloning did not \ntypically occur spontaneously within the focus group discussions, in line with analysis of \nearlier focus groups (Wellcome Trust, 1998). Often the initial discursive object was the \ngeneric concept of cloning, interpretable as reproductive cloning. The frequent references \nmade to \u2018Dolly the sheep\u2019 suggest that reproductive cloning currently operates as the \n\u2018default\u2019 reference point for the generic concept. Participant discussion of therapeutic and \nreproductive cloning as separate technologies often only occurred when one of the focus \ngroup facilitators made the differentiation. Aside from early invocations of the discursive \nresources of \u2018the status of the embryo\u2019 and \u2018interfering with nature\u2019, discussions of the \npermissibility of cloning as both a generic and differentiated technology followed a utilitarian \nethical framework: their permissibility was negotiated in terms of their constructed costs and \nbenefits.  \n \nAcross the focus group discussions, reproductive cloning was routinely constructed as failing \nto provide widespread appreciable benefits or as yielding only the most obscure benefits for a \nvery small number of individuals. The cloning of animals or humans was constructed as \nlikely only to benefit individuals with morally questionable motives and\/or with the financial \nmeans to secure the services of unscrupulous scientists. In conjunction with constructions of \nreproductive cloning as \u2018interfering with nature\u2019 and therefore as representing a potential \ncost, the constructed lack of general benefits of reproductive cloning warranted construction \nof it as an impermissible technology. The social undesirability of reproductive cloning was \nfurther evidenced by its invocation as a discursive resource in terms of being the implied end \npoint in \u2018slippery slope\u2019 arguments against the permissibility of therapeutic cloning. Some of \nthese features can be seen in the following extracts: \n \nArchie  Well, I think the trouble is once the science exists, you will never stop \nscientists pushing the envelope. They are\u2026they are going to take it further and \nfurther. I mean, you talk about this idea of what Gabi said about, you know, \nthere\u2019s allegedly been a child cloned in Italy. I\u2019m quite sure there\u2019s been \nchildren cloned, quite certain of it, but you won\u2019t hear about it, you know.  \nJocelyn You\u2019ll see a film about it. \nArchie You\u2019ll probably find Michael Jackson\u2019s got several at Neverland. \n(Focus Group 7) \n \nMegan The government have already said \u2018yes\u2019 to the therapeutic cloning. We\u2019re \nalready allowed to do that. The government decided for us that that\u2019s okay, \nwhich is a bit worrying, I think. I think we\u2019re the only European country that \napproved therapeutic cloning, I believe. It\u2019s one thing experimenting on \nembryos but also, it\u2019s a bit of a slippery slope into reproductive cloning, isn\u2019t \nit? That\u2019s the logical next step. Okay, they said \u2018Yes, that\u2019s wrong, everyone \nagrees, we\u2019re not going to clone a baby\u2019 but of course they will. \n(Focus group 1) \n \nIn contrast to reproductive cloning, where the differentiation between the two technologies \nwas made and where the link between therapeutic cloning and embryonic stem cell research \nwas also made, therapeutic cloning was constructed as a permissible technology on the basis \nof its potential benefits to human health. The construction of therapeutic cloning as \npotentially contributing to the development of treatments for debilitating conditions, such as \nAlzheimer\u2019s disease and Parkinson\u2019s disease, warranted arguments in support of its \n 10 \npermissibility. However, the construction of such treatments as unquestionable benefits was \noccasionally contested through the re-invocation of discourses of \u2018naturality\u2019 and \u2018natural \nselection\u2019. While the development of such treatments was constructed as desirable and \nbeneficial on an individual level, they were occasionally constructed as not desirable and not \nbeneficial on a collective level where they might result in increasing and increasingly aged \npopulations. The potential benefits of therapeutic cloning and embryonic stem cell research \nwere recast as potential costs in the context of global economic and environmental \nsustainability. The acceptance of therapeutic cloning on the basis of health benefits and \nresistance to acceptance on the grounds of interference with a natural process are evident in \nthe extracts below: \n \nSophie So, then they\u2019re growing the stem cells\u2026Is that the\u2026? Which\u2026which one is \nthat? \nDiana Therapeutic cloning. \nSophie Therapeutic. So, that\u2019s grown just for that. So, if you think about it, you\u2019re not \nreproducing. You\u2019re not messing about with another life. What you\u2019re doing is \nsustaining one that\u2019s here already. So, when you see how people suffer with it \n[Alzheimer\u2019s or Parkinson\u2019s] and what\u2026 Sorry. They don\u2019t suffer because, \nobviously, they don\u2019t know. It\u2019s the family and the grandchildren. I mean, you \nlook at it like that and you think, \u2018Well, yes, if this was just to help them a \nlittle bit\u2019 \n(Focus group 5) \n \nCharlie Therapeutic [cloning], I can maybe understand it. If you get to that\u2026 and \nyou\u2026you do arrest it and it has to be at that stem cell stage\u2026If you arrest the \ndevelopment, I can see the\u2026Yes, I can see that. \nKerry But the population is just going to\u2026if\u2026if\u2026if it is successful, what is going to \nhappen to everybody that is actually on the planet and the planet? I mean, it\u2019s  \njust going to\u2026 \nCharlie I think if we go back 100 years\u2026 \nKerry  There has to be a natural selection of people or animals. \n(Focus group 5) \n \nHuman cloning also featured in the media data. The first major news story in the relevant \ntime period of the data collection was the claim by the US fertility expert Dr Panos Zavos to \nhave transferred a cloned human embryo into a woman. The second was the report in the \njournal Science (Hwang, Ryu, Park, Park, Lee, Koo et al., 2004) on the work of a Korean \nteam led by Dr Woo Suk Hwang, which claimed to have extracted stem cells from cloned \nhuman blastocysts. While the coverage of the claim by Dr Zavos portrayed him as a maverick \nscientist, this latter story was much more scientifically credible. (Note that subsequently there \nhas been controversy surrounding the work of Dr Hwang, who has been accused of scientific \nfraud, which led to his resignation in December 2005 (Wohn, 2006). However, at the time of \nthe media analysis reported here, there was no suggestion that there might be problems with \nthis stem cell research and hence this was not reflected in the media analysis.)  \n \nAnalysis1 of the reporting of research on human cloning revealed that the perceived agenda, \nmotivations and credibility of individual scientists were key for the overall stance taken in \nmedia reports of human cloning work. At the same time questions of the purpose of cloning, \nthe status of the embryo and the risks of such interventions in \u2018natural processes\u2019 were also \nsignificant framings for the media discourse. A number of articles contained both pro- and \n 11 \nanti- representations. However, a moral contrast emerged across the articles between \nreproductive cloning being positioned as generally a bad thing and therapeutic cloning being \ngenerally good, although not without its risks for the future, as also found by Petersen (2001) \nin analysis of Australian media coverage. Both pro- and anti- positions were shored up by use \nof \u2018science\u2019 claims, and the contested status of the stem cell (as human life or as merely \nblastocyst) persisted as an important pivot point for the articulation of different discourses.  \n \nMedia coverage of the Korean stem cell research generally emphasised the differences \nbetween therapeutic and reproductive cloning, partly portraying the difference in terms of \ncurrent scientific ability to produce an embryo from a stem cell line. This locates the \ndifference as one of technique but a careful move is made in the quotation below to use the \ndiscourse of scientific precision which avoids the moral rhetoric of embryos as human. \nIndeed the \u2018big step\u2019 from stem cell line (and early blastocyst) closes down the possibility of \nsuch a moral challenge.  \n \n\"Nobody has cloned a human here,\" said Donald Kennedy, a biologist and editor in \nchief of Science, which published the study today\u2026\"All they have done is create a stem \ncell line from an early blastocyst\u2026To get from that to an embryo is a big step.\" \n(Guardian, Feb 13) \n \nMedia reports on claims of cloning drew clear and consistent distinctions between using \ncloning technology for reproductive purposes, exemplified by the Panos Zavos case and \ncriticised by scientists and others as immoral, and for therapeutic purposes, exemplified by \nthe Korean team which was presented as morally justified and offering significant benefits:  \n \nCloning for reproductive purposes would\u2026be wholly reprehensible\u2026What good \nreason could anyone ever have for wishing to clone him or herself?...In fact the South \nKoreans have cloned an embryo with quite other reasons in mind. They wish to do \nfurther stem-cell research, which (it is hoped) will one day allow us to grow human \ncells that can be artificially stimulated into becoming special tissues\u2026to replace those \ndamaged in a disease process. (Daily Telegraph, Feb 13) \n \nHowever, critics of cloning argued that this distinction was artificial and that, once \ntherapeutic cloning is accepted, reproductive cloning would inevitably follow. The recurrent \nmetaphor here, as in the focus groups, was the \u2018slippery slope\u2019 as implied in the Daily \nTelegraph headline on February 13th \u2013 \u2018Human cells cloned: babies next?\u2019 However, \nadvocates for therapeutic cloning also invoked this metaphor more directly as a rhetorical \nresource that counters potential criticism:  \n \nThe moral distinction between therapeutic and reproductive cloning boils down to the \npurpose for which the embryo is used\u2026The distinction between therapeutic and \nreproductive cloning breaks down, because it is artificial. Once human cloning becomes \naccepted, it is perfectly conceivable that foetus farming and eugenics will follow. (Daily \nTelegraph, Feb 13) \n \nThere is, of course, the slippery slope argument, and it is certainly true that there have \nbeen many such slopes down which we have slipped, or joyously skied, in the past few \ndecades. But unless we believe that we are not masters of our fate\u2026this is not a slope \nwe need slip down, at least with proper regulation. (Daily Telegraph , Feb 13) \n \n 12 \nUnderlying values and beliefs \n \nAnalysis of all the data sets indicated that attitudes towards cloning were underpinned by a \nvariety of values and beliefs. Using the survey data, it is possible to examine the strength of \nrelationship between these values and public attitudes in the context of other known \ninfluential variables such as age, gender and education. The focus group data reveal the \nsignificance at a micro-level of certain orientations towards \u2018the embryo\u2019 and \u2018interference \nwith nature\u2019, themes that also emerge from the media analysis.  \n \nIn order to examine the impact of underlying values on attitudes to cloning in the survey data, \na single cloning attitude scale was calculated by summing the four cloning items, three \ntherapeutic and one reproductive (Cronbach\u2019s alpha = .81). As part of the survey, there was \nalso a series of six questions on values in relation to science. Factor analysis of these items \nyielded three factors: the first comprised three items concerning the effects of human \nintervention on nature and justification of the means to an end (alpha = .53); the second factor \ncomprised two items associated with the risks and benefits of scientific intervention (alpha = \n.62) and the final factor was a single item focusing on public perceptions of the fragility of \nnature. In each case, responses were coded so that a positive value represented a pro-science \nstance.  \n \nA multiple regression was carried out predicting people\u2019s overall attitude towards human \ncloning using dummy variables for religious affiliation and entering the three science and \nnature values as continuous scores. Respondent gender, age and highest educational \nqualification were also included. The results of this regression are shown in Table 3. On the \nfirst step, gender, age, education and religion were entered. The results show that a positive \nattitude to human cloning is associated with younger age and men, whilst those with a higher \nlevel of education are least likely to have a favourable view of this technology. None of the \nvariables for religious affiliation were statistically significant in the model. This contrasts \nwith the finding that two of the three values items were significant in predicting attitude to \nhuman cloning; both were consistent with a more favourable attitude among those with \nvalues that can be characterised as pro-scientific intervention and human progress in the \nnatural world. \n \nValues as resources  \n \nWhilst the survey data allowed for an examination of the relationship between specified value \nvariables and people\u2019s attitudes, the \u2018open\u2019 approach of the focus groups allowed a range of \nvalues and beliefs to emerge in discussion. Participants used what we termed \u2018front-line\u2019 \nresources early in the discussion to frame their views. On the other hand, some formulations \nof views served as \u2018bottom-line\u2019 resources in that they closed down the possibility of further \ndiscussion on the issue for that individual and at times for the other participants interacting \nwith that individual.  \n \nThe issue of interference with nature and the status of the embryo \u2013 the two most frequently \ndrawn upon \u2018values\u2019 or \u2018beliefs\u2019 \u2013 are discursive resources commonly invoked in arguments \nagainst the permissibility of cloning technologies per se. Typically, they are drawn upon \nearly in such discussions and may be interpreted as means by which further discussions of the \npermissibility of cloning technologies may be closed down. Thus they may be interpreted as \nboth \u2018front-line\u2019 and, potentially, \u2018bottom-line\u2019 rhetorical resources. An example of \n\u2018interfering with nature\u2019 talk is provided below: \n 13 \n \nGabi: Well on that same line I would say \u2018Why are we cloning people when we can\u2019t \nlook after the people we\u2019ve got on this earth?\u2019, you know. Why\u2026why are we \nbringing more children onto this earth when we\u2019ve got, you know, thousands \nof twelve-year-old mothers in Britain and thousands starving across the world \nso I guess there\u2019s lots of different things. \nArchie Is that not really what you\u2019re\u2026what we\u2019re all talking about the fundamental \nproblem of interfering with nature. There\u2019s always been that argument with \nscience. \n \nGabi  Yes, but they could spend the money on better things. \nArchie Just leave things alone. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. You know, the \nFrankenstein thing. What\u2026? You\u2019re interfering with nature. You\u2019re playing \nGod. \n(Focus group 7) \n \nThis reveals that Archie does invoke the \u2018interfering with nature\u2019 line himself. Gabi\u2019s \npreceding turn shows how \u2018cloning\u2019 was routinely understood as reproductive cloning. Her \nlocation of cloning within a framework of problems of over-population provides the context \nfor Archie\u2019s comment as his \u2018interfering with nature\u2019 line is a reframing of Gabi\u2019s question \n\u2018Why are we cloning people when we can\u2019t look after the people we\u2019ve got on this earth?\u2019.  \n \nAlthough both of these positions could operate as \u2018bottom lines\u2019, \u2018interfering with nature\u2019 \nwas not as robust in curtailing further discussion as invocations of the status of the embryo. \nWhilst an individual might indicate they were opposed to (or very cautious about) cloning on \nthe basis that it was interfering with nature or that the embryo was actually a human life, the \nformer was more frequently challenged by other participants. Typically, these contestations \nof cautions against \u2018interfering with nature\u2019 were based on the questioning of the historical \nand cultural stability of the concept of nature; nature itself was made a contested resource. \nAlthough the \u2018interfering with nature\u2019 trope did not prove to be an effective bottom-line \nresource, it was nonetheless highly resilient, recurring in reworked ways within and across \nthe focus group discussions.  \n \nAlthough the more effective bottom line resource involving the invocation of the status of the \nembryo could be interpreted as part of broader religious beliefs, this resource was typically \nlocated within a framework of the sanctity of human life (rather than within explicitly \nreligious frameworks), where the concept of human life extended as far back as the moment \nof conception. Examples of conversational turns in which the status of the embryo was \ninvoked are provided below: \n \nPaige I think the major issue with stem cell research is where the stem cells come \nfrom, whether it\u2019s taken from a fetus. They have banks of embryos which \naren\u2019t used from IVF treatment. That\u2019s where they take them from and \nwhether that\u2019s morally right or wrong. That\u2019s really the issue. \n(Focus group 2) \n \nMegan That\u2019s absolutely fine if they take your own stem cells but taking embryonic \nstem cells I don\u2019t think is right. \n[ ] \n 14 \nWell, they\u2019re experimenting on embryos at the moment to extract their stem \ncells and then the thing dies, basically. \nAmy  Not fully-grown embryos. \nMegan  It\u2019s still human life, isn\u2019t it? \n(Focus group 1) \n \nGrace This is what I\u2019m saying. I do, so that\u2019s an issue with me. That\u2019s my worry. So, \nthe minute the sperm and the egg meets and it\u2019s producing a\u2026It\u2019s a life.  \n(Focus group 3) \n \nInvocations of the status of the embryo and the sanctity of human life functioned to exempt \nspeakers from further more complex discussions of the permissibility of cloning technologies \nand other embryological research.  \n \nThe media analysis also indicated the centrality of values relating to the status of the embryo \n(Williams et al., 2003). In the media reports of the Korean stem cell research, critics of \ncloning argued that embryos were human beings and hence should be accorded the rights \nappropriate to human beings. Advocates of the technology, on the other hand, argued that \nembryos cannot be equated with human life as it is usually understood. For example: \n \nOnce the clones are created, they are dismembered and their cells used to grow (we \nhope) spare parts for treating patients. Clearly that is anything but \u201ctherapeutic\u201d for the \nclone embryo. So the question should be: can we treat some people if the process \ninvolves killing others? [ ] But are embryos really human beings? Scientists admit \nhuman life begins at the embryo stage. The embryo has rights. Are all human beings \nequal, or are some more equal than others? (Sun, Feb 13) \n \nHowever, for myself, I cannot truly consider an embryo a full member of the human \nrace. I cannot mourn for its loss as for say, the death of a six year-old child, nor can I \nfeel the same outrage at its deliberately induced demise as for an old lady brutally done \nto death in her own home [ ] Indeed, if anyone claimed to be able to do so, I should \nthink him either a humbug or madman. (Opinion, Daily Telegraph, Feb 13) \n \nIn some cases, the distinction was made between embryos and blastocysts in order to try to \novercome this problem:  \n \nTo say that scientists have cloned human embryos is in itself misleading. We are talking \nabout bundles of cells known as blastocysts which are far from being actual embryos. \n(Daily Mail, Feb 15)  \n \nThe status of the embryo as \u2018human\u2019 is thus a powerful construction invoked both by focus \ngroup participants and by newspaper journalists and opinion writers when discussing research \ninto cloning. In both cases, the construction of the embryo as a human being shuts off any \nacceptance of cloning. Moves to resist this foreclosure on acceptability generally involved \nrepositioning embryos as something not human (as blastocysts). \n \nThe media accounts also drew on wider socio-political contexts. This served to discursively \nposition cloning as an issue with nation-state dimensions. It also drew on familiar discourses \nof the role of the \u2018moral right\u2019 in preventing the advance of science in the USA and parallel \nreligious movements in the UK which aim to have the same impact. The position in the UK \n 15 \non therapeutic cloning was contrasted with that in the USA, especially President Bush\u2019s \nopposition on moral grounds. Advocates of the technology used the rhetorical strategy of \nlinking opposition to the \u2018moral right\u2019 and to a wide ranging \u2018anti-science\u2019 position:  \n \nI am dismayed that any discussion of cloning inevitably becomes dominated by the \ndoommongers, often, conservative Christians who are anti-abortion, anti-IVF and anti-\ncontraception. Those who accuse scientists of playing God invariably believe God \nbelongs to them alone. They would deny the rest of us any choice over these matters. \nThe Bush administration, for instance, has outlawed federal funding for stem-cell \nresearch. America, in its current incarnation, is a fundamentalist culture which also \nrefuses to teach the theory of evolution in some of its schools. We are not such a \nculture. (Daily Mail, Feb 15) \n \nThe linking of this alliance between \u2018conservative Christians\u2019 and those who are \u2018anti-\nscience\u2019 to characteristics of nation-state politics served to position the UK as forward \nthinking but as not immune to the risks that this constructed alliance was said to pose. \n \nReligion  \n \nWhile religion might be expected to be a major issue in determining people\u2019s responses to \nhuman cloning (Evans, 2002), religious affiliation it did not emerge from the various analyses \nas playing a major role. For example, as described earlier, religious affiliation did not play a \nsignificant role in the prediction of attitudes to cloning as assessed in the survey (Table 3).  \n \nCloser inspection of the survey data did, however, reveal some religious differences in the \nstrength of responses to each of the four cloning items (Table 4). Roman Catholic \nrespondents in particular were more negative about cloning for any of the purposes specified. \nOne third held strongly negative views about human cloning for reproductive purposes and \npeople of this denomination were approximately twice as likely as those with no religion to \nobject to human cloning for medical purposes. \n \nIn the vignette study, there were no differences in attitude to cloning between participants \nwho attended religious services on a regular basis and those who did not. Participants who \nregarded themselves as belonging to a particular religion were more likely to agree that \ncloning threatens the natural order of things (Mean=3.85, sd=1.08) than participants who did \nnot (Mean=3.56, sd=1.19; t(344.22)=2.39, p<.05). However, these two groups did not differ \non the other three attitudes to cloning items.  \n \nReligion was not specifically identified by participants in the focus groups to explain why \nthey held certain views or offered particular opinions in the discussion about cloning. \nHowever, references to concerns about \u2018interfering with nature\u2019 or to the status of the \nembryo\/the \u2018sanctity of life\u2019 were occasionally positioned in terms of a generic \u2018God\u2019 or \ncould be understood as drawing on discourses and resources associated with religion and \nreligious belief.  \n \nReligious positioning tended to be done quite subtly in the focus groups. For example, one of \nthe more explicit positionings occurred in response to the quotation from Grace above. In this \nquotation, three times she claimed ownership of the view that life begins at conception (\u2018This \nis what I\u2019m saying\u2026that\u2019s an issue with me. That\u2019s my worry\u2019). In the turn that followed \nthis, another participant responded by saying \u2018Sure. And I respect that as a\u2026a \n 16 \nfundamental\u2026I think it\u2019s a fundamental religious position\u2019. In the subsequent turns, Grace \ndid not resist this construction of her viewpoint as religiously-based and the implicit \npositioning of herself in religious terms.  \n \nDiscussion and conclusion \n \nOverall the research presents a complex picture of attitudes to and constructions of human \ncloning among the British public. It certainly does not present a uniform rejection of cloning \nin any form but rather presents a nuanced picture of variations across types of applications \nand differences in conclusions depending on the methods used.  \n \nThe quantitative data from both the survey and vignette study are in line with previous \nsurveys, which have shown more positive attitudes towards therapeutic than reproductive \ncloning (Calnan et al., 2005). We find that respondents do discriminate across all the cloning \nitems according to the stated purpose and in the survey perceive most negatively the option of \ncloning to prolong a healthy life and reproductive cloning was seen as more positive than \nthis. It should be noted that the terms \u2018therapeutic\u2019 and \u2018reproductive\u2019 were not used in the \nsurvey items but rather the purpose of the cloning was explained.  \n \nThe responses to reproductive cloning in the survey and vignette study may be interpreted as \nmore positive than both the responses in the literature and more positive than the responses in \nthe focus groups. The approval of reproductive cloning in the present study is certainly rather \nhigher than that found in a UK sample by Calnan et al. (2005), although the acceptance of the \nreproductive application by Calnan et al. (2005) may have been reduced by the inclusion of \nthe phrase \u2018the procedure entails genetically modifying one of the woman\u2019s eggs\u2019 in their \nshort scenario. In the present survey, the reproductive cloning question came last after being \npreceded by three items on therapeutic cloning. The question wording, including as it does \nthe term \u2018young infertile couple\u2019 probably helps elicit a more sympathetic response and we \ncan interpret a certain amount of \u2018therapeutic drift\u2019 from earlier items on therapeutic cloning. \nAgainst this interpretation, the results from the vignette study, using a different question and \ncontext, also yielded what can be interpreted as a reasonably strong approval for reproductive \ncloning. The review of US surveys by Nisbet (2004) makes clear the variability of findings \nacross different surveys, which will partly depend on wording of items and although the \nresponses in the current survey tend to be more positive they are not entirely different from \nthe range of values in the literature (Nisbet, 2004; Simpson and Edwards, 2002).  \n \nIn the focus groups, the participants were much more negative about cloning overall than in \nthe quantitative studies, replicating the findings from the focus groups reported by Wellcome \nTrust, 1998). This might partly be explained by the initial assumption within the groups that \ncloning referred to reproductive cloning and that they could see no real benefits from this \ntype of procedure, while seeing many objections.  \n \nWhen therapeutic cloning was introduced in the focus groups this was accepted to a greater \nextent than was reproductive cloning, but reservations were still expressed. The focus group \nresponses on therapeutic cloning would appear to be more negative than the survey\/vignette \nstudy responses on therapeutic cloning. This could be because in the focus groups the \ndiscussions started with a negative conceptualisation of cloning as meaning reproductive \ncloning and then when therapeutic cloning was introduced it was interpreted against this \ninitial negative position.  \n \n 17 \nIt is noteworthy that the results of these focus groups in some respects chime well with those \nobtained in the Wellcome Trust groups some six years earlier (Wellcome Trust, 1998). \nParticipants were generally negative about cloning, assumed that cloning meant reproductive \ncloning and also, whilst initially being more positive about therapeutic cloning, went on to \nexpress a range of reservations.  \n \nThere are of course issues of how representative the samples are in the different studies \nreported. We can be confident of the sample from the British Social Attitudes survey being \nreasonably representative of the British public. However, as with all smaller scale qualitative \nresearch, the focus groups cannot be said to be truly representative but care was taken to \nensure that group participants reflected the demographic profile of the group location and to \navoid recruiting individuals who might have an explicit, identifiable agenda to pursue. The \nprovision of financial incentives was also designed to draw a wide range of participants to the \ngroups.  \n \nIt is not necessarily surprising that the quantitative research and focus groups yielded \ndifferent results in this case and it is of course not possible to say that one data source was \n\u2018correct\u2019. The survey and the vignette study asked people to respond to relatively simple \nquestions without the need to interact with other people who might have opposing views or \nthe need to defend one\u2019s own views in public. Participants are sensitive to the presence or \nabsence of cues provided by the research environment itself (Schwartz and Sudman, 1992; \nHoutkoop-Steenstra, 2000) and the predetermined and constrained response options in the \nquantitative research provides quite a different sense making context from the wide ranging \ndiscussion in focus groups. While the focus groups are useful for capturing the type of \ndiscourse in this context, the quantitative research yields both more representative data and \nmay also reveal what people believe themselves but might find difficult to articulate in a \npublic discussion. Using a variety of methods allows the examination of areas where there is \ngood agreement between methods but also allows insights into areas of disagreement.  \n \nThe present results demonstrate the challenges of integrating qualitative and quantitative \nmethods (for example, Brannen, 1992; Schreier & Fielding, 2001; Todd et al., 2004). We \naccept that, to some extent, the findings from the various studies could sometimes be \nregarded as juxtaposed rather than truly integrated, although integration can take a number of \nforms (Moran-Ellis, Alexander, Cronin, Dickinson, Fielding, Sleney and Thomas, 2006). \nHowever, achieving meaningful integration of data from studies with different \nepistemological positions is a considerable challenge and inevitably involves some tensions \nand narrative \u2018jaggedness\u2019. It was not our intention to try to \u2018resolve\u2019 these partly because the \nfocus of the paper is not methodological and partly because we believe that combining \ndiverse approaches involves learning to live with these tensions for the sake of the more \ntextured picture of the substantive topic that can be produced by a multi-method approach. \nWe hope that this paper will act as a focus for continued discussion about the optimal ways of \nintegrating qualitative and quantitative work and of responding to the epistemological and \nother tensions that can result from this process.  \n \nBoth in relation to the comparison of therapeutic and reproductive cloning and other aspects \nof the analysis, there is a similarity between the types of discourse in the focus groups and the \nmedia analysis. This includes the use of similar phrases and rhetorical devices, e.g. \u2018the \nslippery slope\u2019 from therapeutic to reproductive cloning. This is not surprising since most of \nthe information on cloning that members of the public will have encountered will have been \nobtained from the media (Miller & Riechert, 2000). Early in the focus groups, we asked what \n 18 \nthey had learned and where they had learned this (and the media was by far the most \nfrequently cited source) before going on to explore their responses to this information. \nSubsequent discussions may have oriented to media sources but these sources were identified \nby participants rather than by the researchers. The similarity of responses lends support to the \nassertion by Petersen (2001) that the media coverage in this area is likely \u2018to exert a powerful \ninfluence on public responses\u2019. However, previous focus group research (Bates, 2005) and \nthe research reported here present a more complex picture of the use by members of the \npublic of the resources provided through the media (Condit, 1999). Commonalties may \nreflect the media being well attuned to the nature of public beliefs\/feelings in this area and \nreflecting these in the coverage or of both the media and the public drawing on common \nsources of public discourse in this field. It should be noted that the focus group responses did \nnot in all cases reflect the media coverage. For example, while there was substantial coverage \nof therapeutic cloning in the media this was not picked up in the focus groups until the topic \nwas expressly introduced by the researchers. Also the examination of the media showed a \nrange of views presented often within the same newspaper, and so a simple transmission of \nviews from the media to the public is not really viable (cf Bates, 2005; Condit, 1999). Rather \nmembers of the public appear to draw upon the media and other public discourse but their \nviews will be influenced by other factors such as more general attitudes and also by \ninteractions with others.  \n \nWhen we are asking people to respond to therapeutic and reproductive cloning we are \nimporting a scientific distinction and imposing that framing on people by asking their \nreaction to reproductive and therapeutic cloning (in the survey and vignettes). We clearly see \nthat when we do this, people assess them differently. However, it may be that this distinction \nis much less relevant to people when left to their own devices. Here, the focus group work \nsuggests people think of cloning as a fairly undifferentiated venture which largely coincides \nwith the expert category of reproductive cloning. This may not be surprising and cannot be \nsolely attributable to the coverage of these issues in the media. The term \u2018cloning\u2019 is \ngenerally used to mean producing a second organism identical to the first. For example the \nCompact Oxford English Dictionary of Current English (2005) defines the verb to clone as to \n\u2018make an identical copy of\u2019 and the noun clone as \u2018an organism produced asexually from one \nancestor to which it is genetically identical\u2019. Likewise popular culture has generally portrayed \ncloning as reproductive cloning (Biotechnology Australia, 2006). The concept of therapeutic \ncloning is a scientific construct which has not generally found its way into popular \nconsciousness in the same way (reproductive) cloning has, despite a reasonable amount of \nmedia coverage as observed here.  \n \nAttitudes were shown to be related to underlying values related to scientific progress to a \ngreater extent than to age, gender, education or religion. There were some differences in the \nquantitative data based on religious affiliation but overall religion was not closely related to \nthe expressed attitudes. One possible reason for small explained variance attributable to \nreligion is that people of all levels of religious commitment have values \u2013 around naturalness \nfor example \u2013 that actually make religious belief peripheral. It also should be noted that the \nUK debate on cloning is not polarised by religion to the extent it is in the USA. \n \nLikewise in the focus groups there was little direct appeal to religion, although the major \nrhetorical resources employed to object to cloning could be understood as drawing upon \ndiscourses associated with religion and religious belief. The lack of explicit invocation of \nreligious factors in the focus groups as underlying expressed attitudes may well be related to \nparticipant wariness about explicitly positioning themselves as religious. To have done so \n 19 \nmay have risked being positioned by others as judgemental, narrow-minded, fundamentalist \nor in terms of any of the other negative constructions of what it means to be (constructed as) \nreligious within a largely secular cultural context in which religion is increasingly granted \npositive access to public discourse only in the garb of subjective \u2018spirituality\u2019 (Heelas et al., \n2005). However, taken together with the survey\/vignettes results it would appear that people \nare simply hiding their religious beliefs. The morality of cloning was very prominent across \nthe different methods and this differs from other technological science developments which \nmay simply be seen as amazing or unnecessary. Cloning, however, evokes consideration of \nwhat it is to be human, human identity, scientists losing their moral compass in pursuit of the \nfascinating. In discussion it was clear that certain claims or statements relating to the sanctity \nof nature and the status of the embryo were used in an attempt to foreclose further discussion \nand to position speakers as incontestable on the issue.   \n \nOverall the findings demonstrate that of public views in this area are far from simple. In \nmany cases the findings from the different methods are complementary, offering either \nconfirmation of a finding or providing more insight than would be possible if using a single \nmethod and, in those cases where there is less agreement, giving an insight into the \ncomplexity of the views held in this area.  \n \n \n \n 20 \nReferences \n \nBates, B.

Report on media \nanalysis.  \n \n 1\nTowards an understanding British public attitudes towards human cloning \nResponses to reviewers\u2019 comments \n \n \nThe response to the each comment from the two reviewers is shown in bold after the \nreviewer\u2019s comment. The page numbers refer in all cases to the revised manuscript. \nWe would like to thank the reviewers for their thoughtful and helpful comments and \nfeel that the resulting revisions have produced a stronger paper.   \n \nReviewer #1 \n \nBy bringing together results of four different studies (two quantitative: a national \nsurvey, and a vignette study; and two qualitative: one focus group and one media \nanalysis project), this paper aims at filling a gap in research on public attitudes to \nhuman cloning in the UK. As the authors state on p 3, not much has been published \non the way in which way the public makes sense of human cloning.  \n \nIt is exactly this latter promise - granting insights into HOW the UK public makes \nsense of human cloning - that the current version of the paper does not keep. Whereas \nthe authors obviously were concerned about establishing a balance between \nquantitative and qualitative methods (in a laudable attempt to shed light on public \nattitudes to human cloning from as many angles as possible), the main findings are \nnot very helpful for understanding HOW the British public makes sense of human \ncloning.  \n \nThe implied promise in paragraph 5 of the Introduction has been removed. In \nfact our aims are explicitly stated in the last lines of the Introduction and they \nare to investigate (a) the nature, spread and strength of opinion among the \nBritish population and (b) the resources and reasoning used by people.  \n \nFor example, in the abstract the authors summarize that \"quantitative results showed \nmore positive responses\" (than results of qualitative studies), and that respondents\u00b4 \nwillingness to accept a form of cloning depended on the motives of those who \nperformed it, as well as on potential benefits for human health. On p. 7 they amend \nthat \"although responses were more mixed when the application was reproductive (as \nopposed to therapeutic cloning), nonetheless a substantial number of people (38%) \nfelt that it should definitely or probably be allowed\". The discussion of what could \naccount for this relatively permissive approach to reproductive cloning from the side \nof the respondents of the national survey (as the authors accurately note, the approval \nof human reproductive cloning here is higher than in previous studies) remains \nunsatisfactory.  \n \nThere is now more literature included on survey findings in the Introduction (p 4 \nparagraph 3) which shows that the level in the present study is not so out of line \nwith other studies (Discussion, p 16 paragraph 4). \n  \nIn addition, why did respondents in the focus groups, as opposed to the respondents in \nboth quantitative studies, usually not distinguish between reproductive and therapeutic \ncloning? Could we infer from this that the difference between reproductive and \ntherapeutic cloning does not really mean much to the respondents in the quantitative \n* Response to Review*\n 2\nstudies (in the sense that the meaning did not go beyond different superficial labels \nand images)? If we came to this conclusion, how would this then affect the value of \nthe data?  \n \nThe lack of distinction in the focus groups is now discussed in a new paragraph \nin the Discussion (p 18 paragraph 2). The issue of whether the quantitative \nresponses were an artefact is now addressed in the Discussion (p 16 paragraph \n2).  \n  \nThe second paragraph on p 15 (\"\u2026Participants (in the focus groups) were generally \nnegative about cloning, assumed that cloning meant reproductive cloning and also, \nwhilst initially being more positive about therapeutic cloning, went on to express a \nrange of reservations\" could be read as a telling example of a discussion which is \ninformed almost exclusively by media coverage of cloning (which was to a large \nextent driven by the birth of Dolly, and subsequent Frankenstein fears) and does not \nget to the deeper issue of what and how people think of the technique of cloning and \nits potential impacts (ethical, social, etc). I am not saying that this is the case - but it is \ncertainly an issue worthy of discussion (even if only briefly) in the paper. \n \nTo go further than we have done in our analysis of the qualitative data would \nrequire a paper that was exclusively focused on those data. While this may be \nsomething that we will pursue in the future, the present paper had broader aims \nwhich did not permit more detailed analysis within the confines imposed by the \nword limit. Having said this, we believe that the paper does address these issues. \nAlthough the reviewer refers to the summary in the Discussion there is more \ndetail in the Results section.  \n \nIn addition, whereas it is highly interesting that religious affiliation - and degree of \nreligiosity (p 14) - obviously does not account for much - if any - of the variance in \nattitudes towards human cloning, the authors did not discuss possible explanations for \nthis phenomenon.  \n \nThe discussion on this has now been expanded (p 18 final paragraph ).  \n  \nThe virtual absence of contextualization of the studies  \u00b4 findings in the larger field of \ndebates on the topic of human cloning, as well as the absence of (attempts for) \nexplanations of their findings probably points at a methodological problem. As the \nauthors note in many places, both in the quantitative and in the qualitative studies, \nrespondents  \u00b4views on cloning were very similar to how the issue was portrayed in the \nmedia. The authors note in the abstract that \"much of the information and discourse in \nthis area is drawn from media coverage or that the media reflect public discourse \naccurately\". This is very plausible. However, in addition to that, the striking \nsimilarities between citizens  \u00b4views and media coverage of human cloning might have \nto do with the way in which questions were asked in surveys and focus groups. The \nauthors address this problem briefly on p 4, but then they do not continue this path.  \n \nExtra material has been added on the wider debates on human cloning (e.g. p 3 \nparagraph 3) and extra information has been added on the ways in which the \nquestions were asked in the vignettes (p 7 paragraph 1), survey (p 16 paragraph \n3 and 4) and focus groups (p 18 final paragraph).  \n 3\n \nIn their revisions the authors should include a brief section on what could be seen as \nparticularly British in all four studies\u00b4 results, in a European (see Eurobaromenter etc) \nand global comparison.  \n \nMore information has now been added on the results from surveys in other \ncountries (p 4 paragraph 3). \n \nMost of the data presented in the paper is both original and highly relevant for the \nreadership of Social Science & Medicine. What is missing at this point is a \nmeaningful convergence of the data, as well as a stronger contextualization of it in the \ndebate on human cloning. A more substantial problematization of methodological \nissues would be desirable. \n \nThere is now some extra consideration of this in the revised paper (p 17 final \nparagraph), along with the extra material in response to the previous point.  \n \n3rd paragraph of introduction: The authors write that \"A key issue is under what \ncircumstances, if any, it can be considered acceptable to end one life - that of the \nembryo - with the objective of saving another\". This sentence is confusing. First, this \nstatement does not apply to reproductive cloning (here, no embryo would be \ndestroyed); second, the sentence suggests that those two kinds of life (the one of the \nembryo and the one of the patient) are of the same value. Whereas some people would \nargue that this is the case and their viewpoint is perfectly legitimate, the authors \nshould at least acknowledge that this is only one among several ways of conceiving of \nthe value of different stages of human life. Furthermore, it is crucial that the authors \nnote that the sentence does not apply to reproductive cloning. \n \nIt is now made clear that this refers only to therapeutic cloning and the different \nviews on this are now acknowledged (p 3 paragraph 4) \n \nP 5-6, description of vignette study: authors should inform the readers how \n\"reproductive cloning\" and \"therapeutic cloning\" were defined in this study  \n \nThis has been added into the Method section (p 7 paragraph 1). \n \nP7, last paragraph above headline \"Results\": the description of how media analysis \nwas carried out is too rudimentary. The authors note that they used \"the method of \ndiscourse analysis (broadly defined)\"; however, there are may ways of doing \ndiscourse analysis. Did the authors employ a post-structuralist approach, or a \nstructuralist one? Did their analysis entail word counts? According to which \ncategories did they code the data? Etc (two or three additional sentences might be \nsufficient).  \n \nThe has now been modified to make the analysis clearer (p 8 paragraph 2).  \n \nP9, penultimate paragraph: The authors note that \"there was considerable ambivalence \nin the media reports with some articles containing both pro-and anti-representations.\" \nI suggest to explain what the authors mean with \"ambivalence\" here. Was it that those \nmedia reports tried to present both arguments against and in favor of therapeutic \n 4\ncloning, or was it any other characteristic that made it \"ambivalent\" in the eyes of the \nauthors? \n \nThe word ambivalent has been removed since this was not clear.  \n \nP11, quote at the end of the page: It would be interesting to know whether Archie \ntalked about the \"interfering with nature\" argument upon his own initiative, and, more \ngenerally, in what particular context this argument came up. I suggest to simply add a \nbit more text in the beginning of the quote, or to summarize the discussion among \nfocus group members preceding the quote presented in the paper.  \n \nThe extra quote has been included (p 13 top).  \n \nP12, Grace s\u00b4 quote: It does not come out clearly what point Grace wants to make \nhere, and why the authors selected this quote for the paper. \n \nThis has been replaced by a different quote (p 14 top).  \n \nP14, last paragraph (third below headline \"discussion and conclusion\"): The statement \nthat \"these results contrast with those from the focus groups where the participants \nwere much more negative about cloning overall\" is a bit confusing: I suggest to treat \nrespondents  \u00b4 reactions to therapeutic and reproductive cloning separately here. In \nplaces where there was no differentiation made between the two (neither by the \nmoderators, nor by the respondents), the authors should mention it explicitly.  \n \nThis has now been edited and the discussion of reproductive and therapeutic \ncloning presented separately (p 16 paragraph s 5 and 6).  \n \nLastly, the word \"complexity\" in the paper s\u00b4 title (\"Attitudes to cloning: \nUnderstanding the complexity of British public attitudes towards human cloning\") is \nmisleading insofar as the authors rather demonstrate the complicatedness of the issue, \nnot its complexity in the strict sense of the word. An attempt to understand the \ncomplexities of the matter would have entailed a more thorough discussion of the \ndifferent findings of the various studies, as well as a more substantial discussion of \npossible reasons for differences in outcomes. Most importantly, it would have \nrequired a discussion of how different parameters that account for respondents\u00b4 \nfeelings and opinions do interact. However, this \"problem\" could be solved by \nchoosing a different title. \n \nThe title has been changed to remove the word complexity.  \n \n 5\nReviewer #2 \n \nThis paper represents an attempt to move beyond single methodologies for evaluating \npublic attitudes and an attempt to expand the grounding for how individuals come to \ntheir understandings of human cloning. The authors should be applauded for this \nexpansive scope. Nevertheless, before I can offer a fully positive recommendation, \nthere are a number of topics that should be addressed. \n \n1) The manuscript's aims are somewhat fuzzy. The last sentence of the abstract, the \ngap in the literature identified on page 4 (i.e. It is often uncertain, however, to what \nextent public opinion is influenced by the media environment at any given time or the \nmanner and context in which questions about human cloning are asked.) \n, and much of the conclusion indicate that the authors are concerned with the \nrelationship among the media environment, public discussion, and public attitudes \ntoward human cloning. Then again, the authors suggest on page 4 and in the first and \nlast paragraphs of the conclusion that they are interested in the nature\/spread\/strength \nof public opinion and the resources and reasoning used by members of the public. \nGiven that the authors spend more time developing media as a potential resource, the \nauthors may wish to clarify their aims and provide greater focus for the reader. \n \nThe role of the media analysis within the paper is now made clearer at a number \nof points in the revised manuscript but explicit ly so on p 5 paragraph 1. It is not \nthe intention in this paper to assess directly the impact of media on attitudes but \nrather to examine media coverage as one of the resources the public can draw \nupon.  \n \n2) Regardless of the whether the revision chooses to focus on media itself or media \nand other resources for public reasoning, the authors will want to expand their \nliterature base to account for previous research into public resources for discussing \ngenetic technologies (including cloning). In particular, the authors may find Benjamin \nBates's article in Public Understanding of Science helpful as well as work by Tim \nCaulfield on public attitudes to commercialization and Peter Conrad on genetic \noptimism as each addresses media and public culture's influence on public attitudes \nand beliefs. \n \nThe sections on the media in the Introduction (p 5 paragraph 1) and Discussion \n(p 17 final paragraph) have been expanded.  \n \n3) Methodologically, the authors likely have all of the information to address the \nfollowing queries. The next few items are about reporting the methodology more \ncompletely. \n \na. Since the authors are exploring possible contributors to attitude formation, \nparticularly media, in the survey section, it would be helpful to know if the British \nSocial Attitudes Survey asked questions about media consumption\/use. As a possible \ndeterminate or contributing factor, it seems necessary to ask the public about their \nmedia use to arrive at the conclusions offered at the end of the paper about this \n(potential) causality. \n \n 6\nSince the main point of the paper is not to assess the impact of media coverage \non attitudes, the suggested analysis has not been included. The focus group \nmembers were asked about media use and this is included (p 17 final \nparagraph).  \n \nb. As noted in the conclusion, it is possible that the different vignettes offered, \nespecially the changes in language and value structure in the vignettes, contributed to \ndifferent perceptions. As such, it would be helpful to know if the authors piloted these \nvignettes before the study to control for these. The authors may also want to include \nthe vignettes as an appendix to the mss to demonstrate the cues given to the \nparticipants. \n \nThe full vignettes have not been included because they are rather long but the \nrelevant wording has now been included (p 7 paragraph 1).  \n \nc. When describing the focus group methodology, the authors should include some \nsample questions\/probes. The conclusion states that environmental and contextual \ncues are important to public discussion, making it necessary to know what these cues, \nprovided by the researchers, were. \n \nOn p 7, we described clearly the relevant areas addressed by the questions posed \nin the focus group discussions. The actual questions reflected these descriptions \nvery closely. Standard probes were used (such as \u2018What makes you say that?\u2019 \nand \u2018Could you say something more about that?\u2019) and so we do not feel that \nreaders would gain anything from having the probes specified and we would be \nreluctant to devote precious space to this. \n \nd. In the media analysis methods, it would be helpful to know more about the \nnewspaper articles. What was the total N? Was the coverage balanced? (For instance, \nalthough six newspapers were read, there are no selections reported from the Times or \nthe Daily Mirror, making it possible that they did not discuss cloning at all). And, \nmost important, when the authors state that they used \"the method of discourse \nanalysis (Broadly defined),\" what, exactly did they do? Did they use N-Vivo to \nparallel the focus group analysis? or hand-code? or was it a more impressionist form \nof discourse analysis. The authors should provide a little more detail here, including a \ncitation or two to the proponent of whichever method of discourse analysis that they \nchoose. \n \nThe numbers of articles in each of the papers is now included, along with some \nmore details of the analysis (p 8 paragraph 2).  \n \n4) In the reporting, the authors tend to let the data \"speak for itself\" when talking \nabout focus group and media items. The authors may be trusting the reader to find the \ntropes, metaphors, and the like without spoon-feeding, but the authors should provide \na little more explanation to unpack what each item is saying. As currently written, \nthere is a telling and then a showing of the theme, but less integration to make for an \nexplanation of how the theme is deployed in the talk turn or media clip.  \n \nThe reviewer raises a very important point about the way in which the focus \ngroup data and media are presented to illustrate the analytic points. When the \n 7\npaper was being prepared, we recognised that the format used in the paper is not \nat all the standard one in discourse analytic work; there, the usual approach is to \ndo what the reviewer asks for \u2013 that is to elaborate where exactly in the excerpt \nthe work identified in the analysis is being carried out and how this is being \ndone. However, to do this would take the paper well over the word limit and \nwould make it appear unbalanced: it would read as a discourse analytic paper \nwith some quantitative data almost as an aside. It should be noted that on p 8 \n(paragraph 1) we attempted to address any concern about the way the analysis of \nthe focus group data is presented by stating that \u2018space constraints mean that, in \nthis paper, findings from the focus group studies are presented more as the \noutcome of a social constructionist version of thematic analysis (Joff\u00e9 and \nYardley, 2004) rather than in the level of detail normally expected in discourse \nanalysis\u2019. We believe that the paper has managed the challenges of presenting \nthe discourse analyses in as practical a manner as possible. \n \n5) The word \"Religion\" on page 13 should be underlined and moved to the next page \nas a section heading. \n \nThis has been changed.  \n \n6) The authors' conclusions may be accurate, but need additional support in the main \ntext. There are two zones where this need becomes apparent. \na. The authors claim that there is a \"marked similarity\" between the types of discourse \nin the media and the focus groups. This is not currently demonstrated by the selected \ntalk turn and clips. Different talk turns and clips could be counterpoised to make clear \nthe marked similarities. Alternatively, the authors could code their data more \nquantitatively to show that the \"slippery slope\" metaphor (and the like) pop up \nfrequently in both data sets. \n \nThis has not been done and the emphasis on the similarity has been reduced in \nthe revised a paper.  \n \nb. The authors claim that moral arguments\/arguments over human nature foreclose \ndebate. The selections from the transcripts, however, do not show this. This could be \neasily resolved in the main text by noting what happened in the transcripts after one of \nthese arguments was raised. If in the vast majority of cases the topic of discussion \nchanged or a long silence occurred, the authors' claim would be justified, but the \nevidence needs to be made clear to the reader on this point. \n \nThe reviewer highlights what we think is a lack of specificity in the analysis of \ninvocations of the status of the embryo and interference with nature. We clearly \nstate on p 12 (paragraph 4) that when \u2018bottom-line resources\u2019 were used in an \nindividual\u2019s talk about a certain issue, these \u2018closed down the possibility of \nfurther discussion on the issue for that individual and at times for the other \nparticipants interacting with that individual\u2019. This is the correct rendering of the \nfunction performed by bottom-line resources. They did not foreclose further \ndiscussion per se but rather they provided a resource by which individuals could \nexempt themselves from further discussion on a particular issue at an individual \nlevel. In functional terms, these resources served to position speakers as \nuncontestable on that issue, although the discussion on that issue often continued \n 8\namong other speakers (as is acknowledged on p 14 paragraph following the \nquiets). We cannot really illustrate this because it would involve providing a long \nextract in which the person who used the bottom-line resource was not \nchallenged and no longer took part in the continuing discussion. Reviewer 2\u2019s \nstatement that we have claimed that invocations of the status of the embryo and \ninterference with nature \u2018foreclose debate\u2019 may be based on the overly-concise \nsummary sentence at the end of p 19 paragraph 1. This has now been need to be \nelaborated.  \n \n 1\n \n \nPrepared for submission to: Social Science and Medicine  \n \nRunning head: Attitudes to cloning \n \n \nTowards an understanding of British public attitudes concerning human cloning \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nManuscript\n 2\nAbstract \n \nThe ability of scientists to apply cloning technology to humans has provoked public \ndiscussion and media coverage. The present paper reports on a series of studies examining \npublic attitudes to human cloning, bringing together a range of quantitative and qualitative \nmethods to address this question. These included a nationally representative survey, an \nexperimental vignette study, focus groups and analyses of media coverage. In all of the \nanalyses therapeutic cloning was viewed more favourably than was reproductive cloning. \nHowever, while participants in the focus groups were generally negative about both forms of \ncloning, and this was also reflected in the media analyses, quantitative results showed more \npositive responses. In the quantitative research, therapeutic cloning was generally accepted \nwhen the benefits of such procedures were clear and although reproductive cloning was less \naccepted there was still substantial support. Participants in the focus groups only \ndifferentiated between therapeutic and reproductive cloning after the issue of therapeutic \ncloning was explicitly raised; initially they saw cloning as being reproductive cloning and \nsaw no real benefits. Attitudes were shown to be related to underlying values related to \nscientific progress rather than to age, gender or education, and although there were a few \ndifferences in the quantitative data based on religious affiliation, these tended to be small \neffects. Likewise in the focus groups there was little direct appeal to religion but the main \nthemes were \u2018interfering with nature\u2019 and the \u2018status of the embryo\u2019, with the latter being \nused more effectively to try to close down further discussion. In general there was a close \ncorrespondence between the media analysis and focus group responses, possibly \ndemonstrating the importance of media as a resource or that the media reflect public \ndiscourse accurately. However, focus group responses did not simply reflect media coverage. \n \nAbstract word count: 293 \n \nKeywords: UK, human cloning, attitude, focus groups, media analysis, survey \n \nFull word count: 11102 \n 3\nIntroduction \n \nIn the post-genomic era, the growing capability of scientists to apply cloning technology to \nhuman embryos has prompted widespread media reporting and discussion \u2013 most \ncontroversially over claims that a human clone had been born (e.g. Guardian, 2003). \nAlthough these claims were widely discredited, it is true that today the cloning of human \ngenetic material can no longer be seen as the domain of science fiction. Unlike many other \ncountries, including the USA, the cloning of human cells has been legally sanctioned in the \nUK for the purposes of medical research (\u2018therapeutic cloning\u2019). However, at the same time, \nspecific legislation has been developed to outlaw reproductive cloning, where a cloned \nhuman embryo is implanted and allowed to develop to full term (HMSO, 2001). \n \nCloning is the technique of creating an identical copy of an organism from its genetic \nmaterial using the technique of cell nuclear replacement (MRC, 2002). A distinction is made \n- at least in law - between therapeutic or research cloning and reproductive cloning. The \nformer harvests special cells called stem cells which, at the early embryonic stage of \ndevelopment, have a unique ability to divide and differentiate into a range of body tissues. As \nstem cells from a cloned embryo will be genetically compatible with their donor, their \npotential benefits lie in medical therapy for a range of diseases and degenerative conditions. \nIn reproductive cloning, the same technique is used to create a human embryo that is then \nallowed to develop into a baby that is an identical genetic match to the donor. \n \nThe debate around human cloning has a long history (e.g. Warnock, 1984) but much of the \nmore recent discussions have followed the cloning of Dolly the sheep (Wilmut et al., 1997), \ne.g. UK House of Commons Science and Technology Committee report (1997) and the \nconsultation on Cloning Issues in Reproduction, Science and Medicine launched in 1998 by \nthe Human Genetics Advisory Commission (HGAC) and the Human Fertilisation and \nEmbryology Authority (HFEA) in the UK. This has been mirrored by international debates \non this topic and in 2005 the vote by the United Nations for a non-binding ban on all forms of \ncloning, although this has not prevented research on therapeutic cloning in some countries, \ne.g. the UK.  \n \nMuch of the controversy and debate surrounding human cloning for both therapeutic and \nreproductive purposes centres on moral and ethical issues around the creation of a human \nembryo. A key issue in the debate surrounding therapeutic cloning is under what \ncircumstances, if any, can it be considered acceptable to end one life \u2013 that of the embryo - \nwith the objective of saving another (Reiss, 2002)? Clearly there are many different ways of \nconceptualising the value of human life at different stages and hence resolving such questions \nis far from straightforward. Exactly when in its development should a human embryo be \naccorded human rights and protection? This issue is hotly debated within ethical and religious \ncontexts (for example, see McCarthy, 2003) and is unlikely ever to be resolved, although \nadvisory bodies generally acknowledge that there are specific circumstances where using \nstem cells from human embryos can be justified by the potential health benefits arising from \nthe research. \n \nA subsidiary set of arguments around human cloning arises from the potentially arbitrary \nnature of the distinction between therapeutic and reproductive cloning (Bowring, 2004). The \nreasoning behind what may be termed the \u2018slippery slope\u2019 argument is that advances on \ntherapeutic applications of cloning will inevitably lead to reproductive cloning, regardless of \nits legal status. \n 4\n \nA number of large scale surveys report positive attitudes among the public towards science \nand new scientific developments (Gaskell, Allum & Stares, 2003b; MORI, 2005) but the \nsame sources typically reveal considerable public scepticism about the motivations of \nscientists, and about the science and the application of new technologies. Certainly for \ngenetic science there are particular public concerns about privacy, ethics and tampering with \nnature (Calnan, Montaner & Horne, 2005).  \n  \nCalnan et al. (2005) surveyed members of the public in England and Wales about their \nattitudes to new health care technologies, science and trust in health care practitioners. A \nscenario on reproductive human cloning was used based on an infertile couple participating \nin a clinical trial to have a baby. Only 12 percent accepted that the couple should participate \nin the trial compared with 68 percent who rejected it. Other scenarios based on non-\nembryonic stem cell therapy and genetic screening were received much more favourably, \nleading the authors to conclude that support for genetic technologies is heavily dependent on \nits stated purpose.  \n \nBates et al. (2005) report that polls in the USA from 1998 to 2002 show that 66% to 90% of \nthe American public indicated that embryonic, animal and human cloning were unacceptable. \nLikewise, Gaskell, Allum, Bauer, Jackson, Howard & Lindsey (2003a) found the usefulness \nof cloning human cells to be rated around the \u2018tend to agree\u2019 mark. Nisbet (2004) reviewed a \nnumber of public opinion polls in the USA and while cloning was generally not accepted the \nresults were highly dependent upon the application; in a 1998 survey approval was highest \nfor the application of \u2018infertility\u2019 with 33% approving and there was a 20% approval in a \n2002 survey for the application \u2018infertile couples\u2019 (Nisbet, 2004). Other US surveys between \n1997 and 2002 gave between 9 and 11% agreeing that the cloning of humans should be \nallowed, where the application was reproductive (Nisbet, 2004). Likewise, a 2001 survey \ngave 11% of people agreeing that reproductive cloning should be legal whereas 33% felt that \nit should be legal to clone humans for medical treatments (Nisbet, 2004). Surveys where it \nwas explicit that the cloning would not result in the birth of a human being (but rather were \nfor research or medical treatments) gave between 34% and 59% approving the application \n(Nisbet, 2004). Simpson and Edwards (2002) likewise comment on a Harris poll conducted in \n2001, where 76% rejected reproductive cloning, as showing less objection than might be \npredicted from the positions taken by official organizations and investigators.  \n \nIn 2005, an online survey in the UK by YouGov questioned over 2000 adults about cloning \nand embryo research (YouGov, 2005). A total of 66 percent agreed that \u2018the rights of the \npatient are more important than the embryo\u2019, with only 15 percent disagreeing with this \nstatement. A majority of 58 percent endorsed the view that embryos are not really human \nbeings from the moment of conception but believe that their use should be governed by law. \nJust over one quarter found therapeutic cloning acceptable using embryonic stem cells to treat \ndisease, but a much lower proportion found it acceptable for cosmetic purposes. \nApproximately 6 in 10 people thought that scientists give too little thought to the moral issues \ninvolved.  \n \nA UK qualitative study by the Wellcome Trust (1998), using reconvened focus groups, \nconcluded that participants were overwhelmingly against cloning and that the provision of \ninformation about cloning did little to modify reactions of shock, concern and fear around the \ntechnology. While most of the participants were familiar with the idea of reproductive \ncloning they lacked any prior knowledge of therapeutic cloning.  \n 5\n \nPrevious analyses of media coverage in this area have also highlighted the distinction made \nbetween therapeutic cloning as \u2018good\u2019 and reproductive cloning as \u2018bad\u2019 (Petersen, 2001) and \nalso examined the types of rhetorical devices used in the debate surrounding the use of stem \ncells and contrasting views of future developments (Kitzinger and Williams, 2005). Media \nanalysis on other genetic issues has shown differences in the construction of the \u2018gay gene\u2019 \nbetween the US media, where this was presented as good science and treated with cautious \noptimism, and the UK media which presented the research as the \u2018perils of the gay gene\u2019 \n(Conrad and Markens, 2001). The media is expected to be a major source of public \nunderstanding of genetics and a strong influence on public discourse (Conrad, 2001), \nalthough neither Conrad (2001) nor Conrad and Markens (2001) empirically examined the \nrelationship between media coverage and public understanding or attitude. Some have argued \nthat the public receive an overly deterministic view of genetic science from the media (e.g. \nNelkin and Lindee, 1995) but others have questioned the extent to which this impacts on the \npublic (Condit, 1999; Bates, 2005). The interpretation of information in the media is far from \na linear acceptance of the views expressed but rather the target audience interpret the \ninformation in complex ways and are active rather than passive in the ways in which they use \nmedia information (Condit, 1999). In addition to print and broadcast media, there are other \nsources in popular culture which may have an impact on public views, e.g. science fiction and \nmovies (Biotechnology Australia, 2006).  \n \nWhile provoking strong opinions among many, public surveys and consultation exercises \nabout human cloning show that attitudes vary according to its stated purpose, perceived \nutility and morality (e.g. Bates, Lynch, Bevan, & Condit, 2005; Gaskell, Allum, Bauer, \nJackson, Howard & Lindsey, 2003a; Gaskell et al., 2003b; HFEA, 1998). It is often \nuncertain, however, to what extent public opinion is influenced by the media environment at \nany given time or the manner and context in which questions about human cloning are asked. \nHow the potential harms and benefits of cloning are presented arguably has a direct impact \non the level of public support found in opinion polls (Genetics and Public Policy Center, \n2005; Nisbet, 2004). Public responses to human cloning must also be seen in the context of \nthe current socio-political climate; for example, recent research indicates that although some \ntypes of scientist continue to be considered as valuable sources of scientific information and \nadvice about science, there are growing public concerns that the independence of scientists \nmay be compromised by the interests of their funders and the commercialisation of such \nfunding (MORI, 2005). Commercialisation has also been identified as one of the possible \nreasons for the \u2018hyping\u2019 of genetic science in the media (Caulfield, 2004). These concerns \nmay well have been further intensified by the recent highly visible controversy around \nfalsification of scientific data in this area (Wohn, 2006). \n \nThis brief overview of research exploring public perceptions and understandings of cloning \ndepicts a somewhat fragmented set of findings largely derived from studies using single \nmethods and ranging over a period of years over which there have been considerable \ndevelopments both in the science and in the accompanying media coverage.  \n \nThis paper reports multi-method research on public attitudes towards new genetic \ntechnologies in the UK. Drawing on both quantitative and qualitative data affords us a unique \nopportunity to investigate the nature, spread and strength of opinion among the British \npopulation. In addition, the inclusion of an analysis of the media coverage of genetic \ntechnologies and cloning during the same period as the reported empirical studies of public \nattitudes enables us to juxtapose the media framings of cloning and related issues with the \n 6\nviews expressed by the participants in our study through the different methods. We consider \nthe media coverage as one form of resource which the public may utilise in presenting their \nviews on human cloning. In this respect we do not seek to draw a causal link rather, in line \nwith Hansen (2006), we view the media as reflecting prevailing attitudes and discourses in \ncirculation as well as constituting a set of resources upon which people may draw.  \n \nMethod \n \nThe data reported here were collected as part of a large study on attitudes to genomics which \ncomprised several separate elements. Data are reported from two quantitative pieces of work, \na national survey and an experimental vignette study, and two qualitative elements, a focus \ngroup study and media analyses. Each of these pieces of work was conducted separately and \nthere was no overlap in participants between the different pieces of work. The methods for \neach strand of work are described briefly below.  \n \nSurvey \n \nQuestions on human cloning were administered as self-completion items on the British Social \nAttitudes Survey, an annual survey of social and political attitudes in the UK that was \nconducted between June and September 2003. This yielded a nationally representative sample \nof approximately 2500 adults aged 18 and above. The key questions in the survey for the \npurposes of this paper are four questions on attitudes to cloning for different purposes. The \nfirst three were on therapeutic cloning for different purposes and were preceded by a short \npreamble: \n \nYou might have heard of something called human cloning. One type of cloning would be \nif a person\u2019s genes were copied exactly and used to make an embryo. Cells from the \nembryo could be used to supply the person with tissues or organs that would be a \nperfect match for them, meaning their body would not reject them. Do you think this \nshould be allowed or not allowed for if a person \u2026?  \n1. .. needs an organ transplant \n2. .. needs treatment for Parkinson\u2019s Disease \n3. .. is generally in good health and wants to live longer \n \nWe also asked one question on reproductive human cloning:  \n \nAnother type of human cloning might be used to treat a young couple who are infertile \nand cannot have a child. Suppose that the genes from one of them were copied exactly \nand used to make an embryo with exactly the same genetic make up as that parent. Do \nyou think this should be allowed or not allowed \u2026?  \n \nFor further details about the design of this survey and the questions used see Park, Curtice, \nThomson, Bromley & Phillips (2004) and in particular Sturgis, Cooper, Fife-Schaw & \nShepherd (2004). \n \nVignette study \n \nParticipants in the vignette study comprised 368 adult members of the British general public \nwho were categorised as having either high or low trust in science. The study was carried out \nbetween May and September 2004. The groups were selected on the basis of agreement or \n 7\ndisagreement with the item \u201cThose in charge of new developments in genetic science cannot \nbe trusted to act in society\u2019s interests\u201d. Participants completed a baseline questionnaire \nassessing demographic and attitudinal variables and were then randomly assigned to receive \none of four vignettes. Therapeutic cloning was described in the vignettes in the following \nway: \u2018One use of cloning involves taking special cells, called stem-cells, from cloned \nembryos. These cells could then be used to help treat disease in the person who donated their \ngenetic material, for example, to grow replacement body tissues or organs.\u2019 Reproductive \ncloning was described as follows: \u2018One use of cloning involves placing the cloned embryo \ninto a woman\u2019s womb so that it grows into a new human being.\u2019 \nThe vignettes described either therapeutic or reproductive cloning and contained either \narguments in favour of banning the technology outright or allowing it under regulated \nconditions. Thus the study had a two (therapeutic versus reproductive cloning) by two \n(arguments for banning or arguments for controlling the technology) between-subjects \nfactorial design. Participants then completed follow-up questions on their attitudes towards \nthe situation described in the vignette and cloning in general. For the present analysis the four \nitems of interest are: \n \n1. Cloning, as described, should be banned \n2. Cloning, as described, should be allowed under certain circumstances \n3. Cloning technology threatens the natural order of things \n4. Cloning technology poses no threat to future generations \n \nResponse options ranged from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The vignettes and \nthe questionnaire are available from the authors on request. As a manipulation check the \ninformation in the vignettes was not found to differ in terms of its believability, the extent to \nwhich it was new information, and the extent to which it was in conflict with what had \npreviously been heard. \n \nFocus groups \n \nThe focus group study was carried out between July 2004 and April 2005 and involved ten \ngroups which (potentially) addressed the issue of cloning. Eight were conducted at six \nlocations in England, Scotland and Wales with members of the general public who had no \nparticular involvement or investment in genomics-related issues. Four addressed health-\nrelated technologies; four did not focus on specific applications. Group members were \nrecruited by a fieldwork agency to reflect the demographic profile of the populations in the \nvarious group locations. This resulted in focus groups that were consistently diverse in terms \nof gender, age and occupation; the ethnic diversity of the focus groups varied according to the \ngroup locations. Two additional focus group interviews were conducted with people affected \nby genetic disease, who were recruited through the Clinical Genetics Department of a London \nhospital; these were less diverse and in this case most participants were female. The eight \ngeneral public groups consisted of 80 individuals and the two groups of people affected by \ngenetic disease consisted of 12 individuals. Participants were paid an incentive of \u00a335 to take \npart.  \n \nEach focus group was facilitated by two moderators, using an interview schedule which, \namong other issues, invited participants to identify the developments in (health-related) \ngenetic technologies that they had heard about or encountered and to describe what they had \nheard, what their reactions have been and how they evaluate the acceptability of these \ntechnologies. In relation to cloning, if participants did not distinguish between reproductive \n 8\nand therapeutic cloning, the interviewers provided definitions of these technologies in line \nwith the definitions outlined previously and then asked participants about their responses.  \n \nInterviews were transcribed, coded in terms of content using N-Vivo and then subjected to an \nintegrative form of discourse analysis that attended to both relatively micro-level and macro-\nsocial features of talk (Wetherell, 1998) in order to identify the ways in which and the basis \non which \u2018attitudes\u2019 and \u2018knowledges\u2019 relevant to cloning are constructed and worked with. \nHowever, space constraints mean that, in this paper, findings from the focus group studies are \npresented more as the outcome of a social constructionist version of thematic analysis (Joff\u00e9 \n& Yardley, 2004) rather than in the level of detail normally expected in discourse analysis. \n \nMedia analyses \n \nA qualitative analysis of genomics-related texts was conducted on data drawn from \nnewspaper articles from six UK newspapers (the Times, the Guardian, the Daily Telegraph, \nthe Daily Mail, the Sun, and the Daily Mirror) during a 3-month monitoring period (12 \nJanuary \u2013 11 April 2004, inclusive). A total of 1340 articles were included in the analysis \nwith the following split between the newspapers: Times 450, Guardian 447, Daily Telegraph \n159, Daily Mail 108, Sun 94 and Daily Mirror 82. The analysis followed the same type of \nprocess as for the focus groups above and the results are presented in the same form as the \noutcome of a social constructionist version of thematic analysis (Joff\u00e9 & Yardley, 2004) \nrather than in the level of detail normally expected in discourse analysis. \n \nResults \n \nThe following results are presented under two themes which emerged from the analysis of the \ndifferent types of data: the distinction between cloning for therapeutic or reproductive ends \nand values and beliefs underlying attitudes to cloning. In each case, results are presented from \ndifferent pieces of research in order to illustrate the contribution of each method to addressing \nthese general issues; given space constraints, it is not possible to present all of the relevant \nfindings from any one of the methods.  \n \nTherapeutic versus reproductive cloning \n \nEach of the data sets provides some insights into the nature of the distinction between \ntherapeutic and reproductive cloning. The survey and experimental data show that the \ninformation provided around the purpose of cloning were clearly related to judgements of \nvarious applications. Interestingly the focus group discussions indicated that when people are \nleft to their own devices they do not spontaneously differentiate these two facets. Both the \nfocus group discussions and the media analysis show the use of the \u2018slippery slope\u2019 metaphor \n(Bowring, 2004) affords a way of framing considerations of therapeutic and reproductive \ncloning. \n \nAnalysis of the survey data suggests that obvious benefit is important for the attitudes the \ngeneral public express towards therapeutic cloning.  The purpose of such cloning research \nclearly had an impact on the attitudes people expressed. Survey respondents were strongly in \nfavour of cloning where the benefits were clear (for an organ transplant or for Parkinson\u2019s \ndisease) but not where cloning was simply to prolong the life of a healthy individual (see \nTable 1). Although responses were more mixed when the application was reproductive, \n 9\nnonetheless a substantial number of people (38%) felt that it should definitely or probably be \nallowed (Table 1).  \n \nAs in the survey, the respondents in the vignette study were more positive towards \ntherapeutic cloning than they were towards reproductive cloning (Table 2). This was \nparticularly true for the questions directly related to the form of cloning \u2018as described\u2019 in the \nvignette but was also apparent for the questions which asked about cloning without \nspecifically referring to the vignette.  \n \nIn contrast, explicit distinctions between reproductive and therapeutic cloning did not \ntypically occur spontaneously within the focus group discussions, in line with analysis of \nearlier focus groups (Wellcome Trust, 1998). Often the initial discursive object was the \ngeneric concept of cloning, interpretable as reproductive cloning. The frequent references \nmade to \u2018Dolly the sheep\u2019 suggest that reproductive cloning currently operates as the \n\u2018default\u2019 reference point for the generic concept. Participant discussion of therapeutic and \nreproductive cloning as separate technologies often only occurred when one of the focus \ngroup facilitators made the differentiation. Aside from early invocations of the discursive \nresources of \u2018the status of the embryo\u2019 and \u2018interfering with nature\u2019, discussions of the \npermissibility of cloning as both a generic and differentiated technology followed a utilitarian \nethical framework: their permissibility was negotiated in terms of their constructed costs and \nbenefits.  \n \nAcross the focus group discussions, reproductive cloning was routinely constructed as failing \nto provide widespread appreciable benefits or as yielding only the most obscure benefits for a \nvery small number of individuals. The cloning of animals or humans was constructed as \nlikely only to benefit individuals with morally questionable motives and\/or with the financial \nmeans to secure the services of unscrupulous scientists. In conjunction with constructions of \nreproductive cloning as \u2018interfering with nature\u2019 and therefore as representing a potential \ncost, the constructed lack of general benefits of reproductive cloning warranted construction \nof it as an impermissible technology. The social undesirability of reproductive cloning was \nfurther evidenced by its invocation as a discursive resource in terms of being the implied end \npoint in \u2018slippery slope\u2019 arguments against the permissibility of therapeutic cloning. Some of \nthese features can be seen in the following extracts: \n \nArchie  Well, I think the trouble is once the science exists, you will never stop \nscientists pushing the envelope. They are\u2026they are going to take it further and \nfurther. I mean, you talk about this idea of what Gabi said about, you know, \nthere\u2019s allegedly been a child cloned in Italy. I\u2019m quite sure there\u2019s been \nchildren cloned, quite certain of it, but you won\u2019t hear about it, you know.  \nJocelyn You\u2019ll see a film about it. \nArchie You\u2019ll probably find Michael Jackson\u2019s got several at Neverland. \n(Focus Group 7) \n \nMegan The government have already said \u2018yes\u2019 to the therapeutic cloning. We\u2019re \nalready allowed to do that. The government decided for us that that\u2019s okay, \nwhich is a bit worrying, I think. I think we\u2019re the only European country that \napproved therapeutic cloning, I believe. It\u2019s one thing experimenting on \nembryos but also, it\u2019s a bit of a slippery slope into reproductive cloning, isn\u2019t \nit? That\u2019s the logical next step. Okay, they said \u2018Yes, that\u2019s wrong, everyone \nagrees, we\u2019re not going to clone a baby\u2019 but of course they will. \n 10 \n(Focus group 1) \n \nIn contrast to reproductive cloning, where the differentiation between the two technologies \nwas made and where the link between therapeutic cloning and embryonic stem cell research \nwas also made, therapeutic cloning was constructed as a permissible technology on the basis \nof its potential benefits to human health. The construction of therapeutic cloning as \npotentially contributing to the development of treatments for debilitating conditions, such as \nAlzheimer\u2019s disease and Parkinson\u2019s disease, warranted arguments in support of its \npermissibility. However, the construction of such treatments as unquestionable benefits was \noccasionally contested through the re-invocation of discourses of \u2018naturality\u2019 and \u2018natural \nselection\u2019. While the development of such treatments was constructed as desirable and \nbeneficial on an individual level, they were occasionally constructed as not desirable and not \nbeneficial on a collective level where they might result in increasing and increasingly aged \npopulations. The potential benefits of therapeutic cloning and embryonic stem cell research \nwere recast as potential costs in the context of global economic and environmental \nsustainability. The acceptance of therapeutic cloning on the basis of health benefits and \nresistance to acceptance on the grounds of interference with a natural process are evident in \nthe extracts below: \n \nSophie So, then they\u2019re growing the stem cells\u2026Is that the\u2026? Which\u2026which one is \nthat? \nDiana Therapeutic cloning. \nSophie Therapeutic. So, that\u2019s grown just for that. So, if you think about it, you\u2019re not \nreproducing. You\u2019re not messing about with another life. What you\u2019re doing is \nsustaining one that\u2019s here already. So, when you see how people suffer with it \n[Alzheimer\u2019s or Parkinson\u2019s] and what\u2026 Sorry. They don\u2019t suffer because, \nobviously, they don\u2019t know. It\u2019s the family and the grandchildren. I mean, you \nlook at it like that and you think, \u2018Well, yes, if this was just to help them a \nlittle bit\u2019 \n(Focus group 5) \n \nCharlie Therapeutic [cloning], I can maybe understand it. If you get to that\u2026 and \nyou\u2026you do arrest it and it has to be at that stem cell stage\u2026If you arrest the \ndevelopment, I can see the\u2026Yes, I can see that. \nKerry But the population is just going to\u2026if\u2026if\u2026if it is successful, what is going to \nhappen to everybody that is actually on the planet and the planet? I mean, it\u2019s  \njust going to\u2026 \nCharlie I think if we go back 100 years\u2026 \nKerry  There has to be a natural selection of people or animals. \n(Focus group 5) \n \nHuman cloning also featured in the media data. The first major news story in the relevant \ntime period of the data collection was the claim by the US fertility expert Dr Panos Zavos to \nhave transferred a cloned human embryo into a woman. The second was the report in the \njournal Science (Hwang, Ryu, Park, Park, Lee, Koo et al., 2004) on the work of a Korean \nteam led by Dr Woo Suk Hwang, which claimed to have extracted stem cells from cloned \nhuman blastocysts. While the coverage of the claim by Dr Zavos portrayed him as a maverick \nscientist, this latter story was much more scientifically credible. (Note that subsequently there \nhas been controversy surrounding the work of Dr Hwang, who has been accused of scientific \nfraud, which led to his resignation in December 2005 (Wohn, 2006). However, at the time of \n 11 \nthe media analysis reported here, there was no suggestion that there might be problems with \nthis stem cell research and hence this was not reflected in the media analysis.)  \n \nAnalysis1 of the reporting of research on human cloning revealed that the perceived agenda, \nmotivations and credibility of individual scientists were key for the overall stance taken in \nmedia reports of human cloning work. At the same time questions of the purpose of cloning, \nthe status of the embryo and the risks of such interventions in \u2018natural processes\u2019 were also \nsignificant framings for the media discourse. A number of articles contained both pro- and \nanti- representations. However, a moral contrast emerged across the articles between \nreproductive cloning being positioned as generally a bad thing and therapeutic cloning being \ngenerally good, although not without its risks for the future, as also found by Petersen (2001) \nin analysis of Australian media coverage. Both pro- and anti- positions were shored up by use \nof \u2018science\u2019 claims, and the contested status of the stem cell (as human life or as merely \nblastocyst) persisted as an important pivot point for the articulation of different discourses.  \n \nMedia coverage of the Korean stem cell research generally emphasised the differences \nbetween therapeutic and reproductive cloning, partly portraying the difference in terms of \ncurrent scientific ability to produce an embryo from a stem cell line. This locates the \ndifference as one of technique but a careful move is made in the quotation below to use the \ndiscourse of scientific precision which avoids the moral rhetoric of embryos as human beings. \nIndeed the \u2018big step\u2019 from stem cell line (and early blastocyst) closes down the possibility of \nsuch a moral challenge.  \n \n\"Nobody has cloned a human here,\" said Donald Kennedy, a biologist and editor in \nchief of Science, which published the study today\u2026\"All they have done is create a stem \ncell line from an early blastocyst\u2026To get from that to an embryo is a big step.\" \n(Guardian, Feb 13) \n \nMedia reports on claims of cloning drew clear and consistent distinctions between using \ncloning technology for reproductive purposes, exemplified by the Panos Zavos case and \ncriticised by scientists and others as immoral, and for therapeutic purposes, exemplified by \nthe Korean team which was presented as morally justified and offering significant benefits:  \n \nCloning for reproductive purposes would\u2026be wholly reprehensible\u2026What good \nreason could anyone ever have for wishing to clone him or herself?...In fact the South \nKoreans have cloned an embryo with quite other reasons in mind. They wish to do \nfurther stem-cell research, which (it is hoped) will one day allow us to grow human \ncells that can be artificially stimulated into becoming special tissues\u2026to replace those \ndamaged in a disease process. (Daily Telegraph, Feb 13) \n \nHowever, critics of cloning argued that this distinction was artificial and that, once \ntherapeutic cloning is accepted, reproductive cloning would inevitably follow. The recurrent \nmetaphor here, as in the focus groups, was the \u2018slippery slope\u2019 as implied in the Daily \nTelegraph headline on February 13th \u2013 \u2018Human cells cloned: babies next?\u2019 However, \nadvocates for therapeutic cloning also invoked this metaphor more directly as a rhetorical \nresource that counters potential criticism:  \n \nThe moral distinction between therapeutic and reproductive cloning boils down to the \npurpose for which the embryo is used\u2026The distinction between therapeutic and \nreproductive cloning breaks down, because it is artificial. Once human cloning becomes \n 12 \naccepted, it is perfectly conceivable that foetus farming and eugenics will follow. (Daily \nTelegraph, Feb 13) \n \nThere is, of course, the slippery slope argument, and it is certainly true that there have \nbeen many such slopes down which we have slipped, or joyously skied, in the past few \ndecades. But unless we believe that we are not masters of our fate\u2026this is not a slope \nwe need slip down, at least with proper regulation. (Daily Telegraph , Feb 13) \n \nUnderlying values and beliefs \n \nAnalysis of all the data sets indicated that attitudes towards cloning were underpinned by a \nvariety of values and beliefs. Using the survey data, it is possible to examine the strength of \nrelationship between these values and public attitudes in the context of other known \ninfluential variables such as age, gender and education. The focus group data reveal the \nsignificance at a micro-level of certain orientations towards \u2018the embryo\u2019 and \u2018interference \nwith nature\u2019, themes that also emerge from the media analysis.  \n \nIn order to examine the impact of underlying values on attitudes to cloning in the survey data, \na single cloning attitude scale was calculated by summing the four cloning items, three \ntherapeutic and one reproductive (Cronbach\u2019s alpha = .81). As part of the survey, there was \nalso a series of six questions on values in relation to science. Factor analysis of these items \nyielded three factors: the first comprised three items concerning the effects of human \nintervention on nature and justification of the means to an end (alpha = .53); the second factor \ncomprised two items associated with the risks and benefits of scientific intervention (alpha = \n.62) and the final factor was a single item focusing on public perceptions of the fragility of \nnature. In each case, responses were coded so that a positive value represented a pro-science \nstance.  \n \nA multiple regression was carried out predicting people\u2019s overall attitude towards human \ncloning using dummy variables for religious affiliation and entering the three science and \nnature values as continuous scores. Respondent gender, age and highest educational \nqualification were also included. The results of this regression are shown in Table 3. On the \nfirst step, gender, age, education and religion were entered. The results show that a positive \nattitude to human cloning is associated with younger age and men, whilst those with a higher \nlevel of education are least likely to have a favourable view of this technology. None of the \nvariables for religious affiliation were statistically significant in the model. This contrasts \nwith the finding that two of the three values items were significant in predicting attitude to \nhuman cloning; both were consistent with a more favourable attitude among those with \nvalues that can be characterised as pro-scientific intervention and human progress in the \nnatural world. \n \nValues as resources  \n \nWhilst the survey data allowed for an examination of the relationship between specified value \nvariables and people\u2019s attitudes, the \u2018open\u2019 approach of the focus groups allowed a range of \nvalues and beliefs to emerge in discussion. Participants used what we termed \u2018front-line\u2019 \nresources early in the discussion to frame their views. On the other hand, some formulations \nof views served as \u2018bottom-line\u2019 resources in that they closed down the possibility of further \ndiscussion on the issue for that individual and at times for the other participants interacting \nwith that individual.  \n 13 \n \nThe issue of interference with nature and the status of the embryo \u2013 the two most frequently \ndrawn upon \u2018values\u2019 or \u2018beliefs\u2019 \u2013 are discursive resources commonly invoked in arguments \nagainst the permissibility of cloning technologies per se. Typically, they are drawn upon \nearly in such discussions and may be interpreted as means by which further discussions of the \npermissibility of cloning technologies may be closed down. Thus they may be interpreted as \nboth \u2018front-line\u2019 and, potentially, \u2018bottom-line\u2019 rhetorical resources. An example of \n\u2018interfering with nature\u2019 talk is provided below: \n \nGabi: Well on that same line I would say \u2018Why are we cloning people when we can\u2019t \nlook after the people we\u2019ve got on this earth?\u2019, you know. Why\u2026why are we \nbringing more children onto this earth when we\u2019ve got, you know, thousands \nof twelve-year-old mothers in Britain and thousands starving across the world \nso I guess there\u2019s lots of different things. \nArchie Is that not really what you\u2019re\u2026what we\u2019re all talking about the fundamental \nproblem of interfering with nature. There\u2019s always been that argument with \nscience. \n \nGabi  Yes, but they could spend the money on better things. \nArchie Just leave things alone. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. You know, the \nFrankenstein thing. What\u2026? You\u2019re interfering with nature. You\u2019re playing \nGod. \n(Focus group 7) \n \nThis reveals that Archie does invoke the \u2018interfering with nature\u2019 line himself. Gabi\u2019s \npreceding turn shows how \u2018cloning\u2019 was routinely understood as reproductive cloning. Her \nlocation of cloning within a framework of problems of over-population provides the context \nfor Archie\u2019s comment as his \u2018interfering with nature\u2019 line is a reframing of Gabi\u2019s question \n\u2018Why are we cloning people when we can\u2019t look after the people we\u2019ve got on this earth?\u2019.  \n \nAlthough both of these positions could operate as \u2018bottom lines\u2019, \u2018interfering with nature\u2019 \nwas not as robust in curtailing further discussion as invocations of the status of the embryo. \nWhilst an individual might indicate they were opposed to (or very cautious about) cloning on \nthe basis that it was interfering with nature or that the embryo was actually a human life, the \nformer was more frequently challenged by other participants. Typically, these contestations \nof cautions against \u2018interfering with nature\u2019 were based on the questioning of the historical \nand cultural stability of the concept of nature; nature itself was made a contested resource. \nAlthough the \u2018interfering with nature\u2019 trope did not prove to be an effective bottom-line \nresource, it was nonetheless highly resilient, recurring in reworked ways within and across \nthe focus group discussions.  \n \nAlthough the more effective bottom line resource involving the invocation of the status of the \nembryo could be interpreted as part of broader religious beliefs, this resource was typically \nlocated within a framework of the sanctity of human life (rather than within explicitly \nreligious frameworks), where the concept of human life extended as far back as the moment \nof conception. Examples of conversational turns in which the status of the embryo was \ninvoked are provided below: \n \nPaige I think the major issue with stem cell research is where the stem cells come \nfrom, whether it\u2019s taken from a fetus. They have banks of embryos which \n 14 \naren\u2019t used from IVF treatment. That\u2019s where they take them from and \nwhether that\u2019s morally right or wrong. That\u2019s really the issue. \n(Focus group 2) \n \nMegan That\u2019s absolutely fine if they take your own stem cells but taking embryonic \nstem cells I don\u2019t think is right. \n[ ] \nWell, they\u2019re experimenting on embryos at the moment to extract their stem \ncells and then the thing dies, basically. \nAmy  Not fully-grown embryos. \nMegan  It\u2019s still human life, isn\u2019t it? \n(Focus group 1) \n \nGrace This is what I\u2019m saying. I do, so that\u2019s an issue with me. That\u2019s my worry. So, \nthe minute the sperm and the egg meets and it\u2019s producing a\u2026It\u2019s a life.  \n(Focus group 3) \n \nInvocations of the status of the embryo and the sanctity of human life functioned to exempt \nspeakers from further more complex discussions of the permissibility of cloning technologies \nand other embryological research.  \n \nThe media analysis also indicated the centrality of values relating to the status of the embryo \n(Williams et al., 2003). In the media reports of the Korean stem cell research, critics of \ncloning argued that embryos were human beings and hence should be accorded the rights \nappropriate to human beings. Advocates of the technology, on the other hand, argued that \nembryos cannot be equated with human life as it is usually understood. For example: \n \nOnce the clones are created, they are dismembered and their cells used to grow (we \nhope) spare parts for treating patients. Clearly that is anything but \u201ctherapeutic\u201d for the \nclone embryo. So the question should be: can we treat some people if the process \ninvolves killing others? [ ] But are embryos really human beings? Scientists admit \nhuman life begins at the embryo stage. The embryo has rights. Are all human beings \nequal, or are some more equal than others? (Sun, Feb 13) \n \nHowever, for myself, I cannot truly consider an embryo a full member of the human \nrace. I cannot mourn for its loss as for say, the death of a six year-old child, nor can I \nfeel the same outrage at its deliberately induced demise as for an old lady brutally done \nto death in her own home [ ] Indeed, if anyone claimed to be able to do so, I should \nthink him either a humbug or madman. (Opinion, Daily Telegraph, Feb 13) \n \nIn some cases, the distinction was made between embryos and blastocysts in order to try to \novercome this problem:  \n \nTo say that scientists have cloned human embryos is in itself misleading. We are talking \nabout bundles of cells known as blastocysts which are far from being actual embryos. \n(Daily Mail, Feb 15)  \n \nThe status of the embryo as \u2018human\u2019 is thus a powerful construction invoked both by focus \ngroup participants and by newspaper journalists and opinion writers when discussing research \ninto cloning. In both cases, the construction of the embryo as a human being shuts off any \n 15 \nacceptance of cloning. Moves to resist this foreclosure on acceptability generally involved \nrepositioning embryos as something not human (as blastocysts). \n \nThe media accounts also drew on wider socio-political contexts. This served to discursively \nposition cloning as an issue with nation-state dimensions. It also drew on familiar discourses \nof the role of the \u2018moral right\u2019 in preventing the advance of science in the USA and parallel \nreligious movements in the UK which aim to have the same impact. The position in the UK \non therapeutic cloning was contrasted with that in the USA, especially President Bush\u2019s \nopposition on moral grounds. Advocates of the technology used the rhetorical strategy of \nlinking opposition to the \u2018moral right\u2019 and to a wide ranging \u2018anti-science\u2019 position:  \n \nI am dismayed that any discussion of cloning inevitably becomes dominated by the \ndoommongers, often, conservative Christians who are anti-abortion, anti-IVF and anti-\ncontraception. Those who accuse scientists of playing God invariably believe God \nbelongs to them alone. They would deny the rest of us any choice over these matters. \nThe Bush administration, for instance, has outlawed federal funding for stem-cell \nresearch. America, in its current incarnation, is a fundamentalist culture which also \nrefuses to teach the theory of evolution in some of its schools. We are not such a \nculture. (Daily Mail, Feb 15) \n \nThe linking of this alliance between \u2018conservative Christians\u2019 and those who are \u2018anti-\nscience\u2019 to characteristics of nation-state politics served to position the UK as forward \nthinking but as not immune to the risks that this constructed alliance was said to pose. \n \nReligion  \n \nWhile religion might be expected to be a major issue in determining people\u2019s responses to \nhuman cloning (Evans, 2002), religious affiliation it did not emerge from the various analyses \nas playing a major role. For example, as described earlier, religious affiliation did not play a \nsignificant role in the prediction of attitudes to cloning as assessed in the survey (Table 3).  \n \nCloser inspection of the survey data did, however, reveal some religious differences in the \nstrength of responses to each of the four cloning items (Table 4). Roman Catholic \nrespondents in particular were more negative about cloning for any of the purposes specified. \nOne third held strongly negative views about human cloning for reproductive purposes and \npeople of this denomination were approximately twice as likely as those with no religion to \nobject to human cloning for medical purposes. \n \nIn the vignette study, there were no differences in attitude to cloning between participants \nwho attended religious services on a regular basis and those who did not. Participants who \nregarded themselves as belonging to a particular religion were more likely to agree that \ncloning threatens the natural order of things (Mean=3.85, sd=1.08) than participants who did \nnot (Mean=3.56, sd=1.19; t(344.22)=2.39, p<.05). However, these two groups did not differ \non the other three attitudes to cloning items.  \n \nReligion was not specifically identified by participants in the focus groups to explain why \nthey held certain views or offered particular opinions in the discussion about cloning. \nHowever, references to concerns about \u2018interfering with nature\u2019 or to the status of the \nembryo\/the \u2018sanctity of life\u2019 were occasionally positioned in terms of a generic \u2018God\u2019 or \n 16 \ncould be understood as drawing on discourses and resources associated with religion and \nreligious belief.  \n \nReligious positioning tended to be done quite subtly in the focus groups. For example, one of \nthe more explicit positionings occurred in response to the quotation from Grace above. In this \nquotation, three times she claimed ownership of the view that life begins at conception (\u2018This \nis what I\u2019m saying\u2026that\u2019s an issue with me. That\u2019s my worry\u2019). In the turn that followed \nthis, another participant responded by saying \u2018Sure. And I respect that as a\u2026a \nfundamental\u2026I think it\u2019s a fundamental religious position\u2019. In the subsequent turns, Grace \ndid not resist this construction of her viewpoint as religiously-based and the implicit \npositioning of herself in religious terms.  \n \nDiscussion and conclusion \n \nOverall the research presents a complex picture of attitudes to and constructions of human \ncloning among the British public. It certainly does not present a uniform rejection of cloning \nin any form but rather presents a nuanced picture of variations across types of applications \nand differences in conclusions depending on the methods used.  \n \nThe quantitative data from both the survey and vignette study are in line with previous \nsurveys, which have shown more positive attitudes towards therapeutic than reproductive \ncloning (Calnan et al., 2005). We find that respondents do discriminate across all the cloning \nitems according to the stated purpose and in the survey perceive most negatively the option of \ncloning to prolong a healthy life and reproductive cloning was seen as more positive than \nthis. It should be noted that the terms \u2018therapeutic\u2019 and \u2018reproductive\u2019 were not used in the \nsurvey items but rather the purpose of the cloning was explained.  \n \nThe responses to reproductive cloning in the survey and vignette study may be interpreted as \nmore positive than both the responses in the literature and more positive than the responses in \nthe focus groups. The approval of reproductive cloning in the present study is certainly rather \nhigher than that found in a UK sample by Calnan et al. (2005), although the acceptance of the \nreproductive application by Calnan et al. (2005) may have been reduced by the inclusion of \nthe phrase \u2018the procedure entails genetically modifying one of the woman\u2019s eggs\u2019 in their \nshort scenario. In the present survey, the reproductive cloning question came last after being \npreceded by three items on therapeutic cloning. The question wording, including as it does \nthe term \u2018young infertile couple\u2019 probably helps elicit a more sympathetic response and we \ncan interpret a certain amount of \u2018therapeutic drift\u2019 from earlier items on therapeutic cloning. \nAgainst this interpretation, the results from the vignette study, using a different question and \ncontext, also yielded what can be interpreted as a reasonably strong approval for reproductive \ncloning. The review of US surveys by Nisbet (2004) makes clear the variability of findings \nacross different surveys, which will partly depend on wording of items and although the \nresponses in the current survey tend to be more positive they are not entirely different from \nthe range of values in the literature (Nisbet, 2004; Simpson and Edwards, 2002).  \n \nIn the focus groups, the participants were much more negative about cloning overall than in \nthe quantitative studies, replicating the findings from the focus groups reported by Wellcome \nTrust, 1998). This might partly be explained by the initial assumption within the groups that \ncloning referred to reproductive cloning and that they could see no real benefits from this \ntype of procedure, while seeing many objections.  \n \n 17 \nWhen therapeutic cloning was introduced in the focus groups this was accepted to a greater \nextent than was reproductive cloning, but reservations were still expressed. The focus group \nresponses on therapeutic cloning would appear to be more negative than the survey\/vignette \nstudy responses on therapeutic cloning. This could be because in the focus groups the \ndiscussions started with a negative conceptualisation of cloning as meaning reproductive \ncloning and then when therapeutic cloning was introduced it was interpreted against this \ninitial negative position.  \n \nIt is noteworthy that the results of these focus groups in some respects chime well with those \nobtained in the Wellcome Trust groups some six years earlier (Wellcome Trust, 1998). \nParticipants were generally negative about cloning, assumed that cloning meant reproductive \ncloning and also, whilst initially being more positive about therapeutic cloning, went on to \nexpress a range of reservations.  \n \nThere are of course issues of how representative the samples are in the different studies \nreported. We can be confident of the sample from the British Social Attitudes survey being \nreasonably representative of the British public. However, as with all smaller scale qualitative \nresearch, the focus groups cannot be said to be truly representative but care was taken to \nensure that group participants reflected the demographic profile of the group location and to \navoid recruiting individuals who might have an explicit, identifiable agenda to pursue. The \nprovision of financial incentives was also designed to draw a wide range of participants to the \ngroups.  \n \nIt is not necessarily surprising that the quantitative research and focus groups yielded \ndifferent results in this case and it is of course not possible to say that one data source was \n\u2018correct\u2019. The survey and the vignette study asked people to respond to relatively simple \nquestions without the need to interact with other people who might have opposing views or \nthe need to defend one\u2019s own views in public. Participants are sensitive to the presence or \nabsence of cues provided by the research environment itself (Schwartz and Sudman, 1992; \nHoutkoop-Steenstra, 2000) and the predetermined and constrained response options in the \nquantitative research provides quite a different sense making context from the wide ranging \ndiscussion in focus groups. While the focus groups are useful for capturing the type of \ndiscourse in this context, the quantitative research yields both more representative data and \nmay also reveal what people believe themselves but might find difficult to articulate in a \npublic discussion. Using a variety of methods allows the examination of areas where there is \ngood agreement between methods but also allows insights into areas of disagreement.  \n \nThe present results demonstrate the challenges of integrating qualitative and quantitative \nmethods (for example, Brannen, 1992; Schreier & Fielding, 2001; Todd et al., 2004). We \naccept that, to some extent, the findings from the various studies could sometimes be \nregarded as juxtaposed rather than truly integrated, although integration can take a number of \nforms (Moran-Ellis, Alexander, Cronin, Dickinson, Fielding, Sleney and Thomas, 2006). \nHowever, achieving meaningful integration of data from studies with different \nepistemological positions is a considerable challenge and inevitably involves some tensions \nand narrative \u2018jaggedness\u2019. It was not our intention to try to \u2018resolve\u2019 these partly because the \nfocus of the paper is not methodological and partly because we believe that combining \ndiverse approaches involves learning to live with these tensions for the sake of the more \ntextured picture of the substantive topic that can be produced by a multi-method approach. \nWe hope that this paper will act as a focus for continued discussion about the optimal ways of \n 18 \nintegrating qualitative and quantitative work and of responding to the epistemological and \nother tensions that can result from this process.  \n \nBoth in relation to the comparison of therapeutic and reproductive cloning and other aspects \nof the analysis, there is a similarity between the types of discourse in the focus groups and the \nmedia analysis. This includes the use of similar phrases and rhetorical devices, e.g. \u2018the \nslippery slope\u2019 from therapeutic to reproductive cloning. This is not surprising since most of \nthe information on cloning that members of the public will have encountered will have been \nobtained from the media (Miller & Riechert, 2000). Early in the focus groups, we asked what \nthey had learned and where they had learned this (and the media was by far the most \nfrequently cited source) before going on to explore their responses to this information. \nSubsequent discussions may have oriented to media sources but these sources were identified \nby participants rather than by the researchers. The similarity of responses lends support to the \nassertion by Petersen (2001) that the media coverage in this area is likely \u2018to exert a powerful \ninfluence on public responses\u2019. However, previous focus group research (Bates, 2005) and \nthe research reported here present a more complex picture of the use by members of the \npublic of the resources provided through the media (Condit, 1999). Commonalties may \nreflect the media being well attuned to the nature of public beliefs\/feelings in this area and \nreflecting these in the coverage or of both the media and the public drawing on common \nsources of public discourse in this field. It should be noted that the focus group responses did \nnot in all cases reflect the media coverage. For example, while there was substantial coverage \nof therapeutic cloning in the media this was not picked up in the focus groups until the topic \nwas expressly introduced by the researchers. Also the examination of the media showed a \nrange of views presented often within the same newspaper, and so a simple transmission of \nviews from the media to the public is not really viable (cf Bates, 2005; Condit, 1999). Rather \nmembers of the public appear to draw upon the media and other public discourse but their \nviews will be influenced by other factors such as more general attitudes and also by \ninteractions with others.  \n \nWhen we are asking people to respond to therapeutic and reproductive cloning we are \nimporting a scientific distinction and imposing that framing on people by asking their \nreaction to reproductive and therapeutic cloning (in the survey and vignettes). We clearly see \nthat when we do this, people assess them differently. However, it may be that this distinction \nis much less relevant to people when left to their own devices. Here, the focus group work \nsuggests people think of cloning as a fairly undifferentiated venture which largely coincides \nwith the expert category of reproductive cloning. This may not be surprising and cannot be \nsolely attributable to the coverage of these issues in the media. The term \u2018cloning\u2019 is \ngenerally used to mean producing a second organism identical to the first. For example the \nCompact Oxford English Dictionary of Current English (2005) defines the verb to clone as to \n\u2018make an identical copy of\u2019 and the noun clone as \u2018an organism produced asexually from one \nancestor to which it is genetically identical\u2019. Likewise popular culture has generally portrayed \ncloning as reproductive cloning (Biotechnology Australia, 2006). The concept of therapeutic \ncloning is a scientific construct which has not generally found its way into popular \nconsciousness in the same way (reproductive) cloning has, despite a reasonable amount of \nmedia coverage as observed here.  \n \nAttitudes were shown to be related to underlying values related to scientific progress to a \ngreater extent than to age, gender, education or religion. There were some differences in the \nquantitative data based on religious affiliation but overall religion was not closely related to \nthe expressed attitudes. One possible reason for small explained variance attributable to \n 19 \nreligion is that people of all levels of religious commitment have values \u2013 around naturalness \nfor example \u2013 that actually make religious belief peripheral. It also should be noted that the \nUK debate on cloning is not polarised by religion to the extent it is in the USA. \n \nLikewise in the focus groups there was little direct appeal to religion, although the major \nrhetorical resources employed to object to cloning could be understood as drawing upon \ndiscourses associated with religion and religious belief. The lack of explicit invocation of \nreligious factors in the focus groups as underlying expressed attitudes may well be related to \nparticipant wariness about explicitly positioning themselves as religious. To have done so \nmay have risked being positioned by others as judgemental, narrow-minded, fundamentalist \nor in terms of any of the other negative constructions of what it means to be (constructed as) \nreligious within a largely secular cultural context in which religion is increasingly granted \npositive access to public discourse only in the garb of subjective \u2018spirituality\u2019 (Heelas et al., \n2005). However, taken together with the survey\/vignettes results it would appear that people \nare simply hiding their religious beliefs. The question of the morality of cloning was very \nprominent across the different methods and this differs from other technological science \ndevelopments which may simply be seen as amazing or unnecessary. Cloning, however, \nevokes consideration of what it is to be human, human identity, scientists losing their moral \ncompass in pursuit of the fascinating. In discussion it was clear that certain claims or \nstatements relating to the sanctity of nature and the status of the embryo were used in an \nattempt to foreclose further discussion and to position speakers as incontestable on the issue. \nThis is not to say that they foreclosed further discussion per se but rather they provided a \nresource by which individuals could exempt themselves from further discussion on a \nparticular issue at an individual level. In functional terms, these resources served to position \nspeakers as incontestable on that issue, although the discussion on that issue often continued \namong other speakers.  \n \nOverall the findings demonstrate that of public views in this area are far from simple. In \nmany cases the findings from the different methods are complementary, offering either \nconfirmation of a finding or providing more insight than would be possible if using a single \nmethod and, in those cases where there is less agreement, giving an insight into the \ncomplexity of the views held in this area.  \n \n \n \n 20 \nReferences \n \nBates, B.

Martha Augoustinos, Shona Crabb, and Amanda LeCouteur (2005). Representations of \ngenomics in the UK: Media, interest groups, and Government texts. Report on media \nanalysis.  \n \nTowards an understanding of British public attitudes concerning human cloning \nResponses to reviewers\u2019 comments \n \n \nThe response to each comment from the two reviewers is shown in bold after the \nreviewer\u2019s comment. The page numbers refer in all cases to the second revision of the \nmanuscript.  \n \nEditor \n \nSome more detail on the focus group sessions would also be helpful - we presumed \nthat each group had a mix of participants in terms of age, gender etc but this is not \nexplicit. \n \nSome further detail on the composition of the focus groups has now been added \n(p. 7, first paragraph after subheading \u2018Focus groups\u2019).  \n \nReviewer #1 \n \nP 3, first sentence in last para: \u201eA subsidiary set of arguments around human cloning \narises from the connections between therapeutic and reproductive cloning\": the word \n\u201econnections\" is not very precise here. If I remember correctly, Bowring (to whom the \nauthors refer here) argued that the distinction between the two is somewhat arbitrary \nand will not be able to be policed effectively (the authors rightly refer to the slippery \nslope argument in the next sentence; all I suggest here is to find a better way to \nrepresent this approach than speaking of \"connections\" - it s\u00b4 too vague). \n \n\u2018Connections\u2019 has now been changed to \u2018potentially arbitrary nature of the \ndistinction\u2019 in line with the referee\u2019s suggestion (p. 3, last paragraph). \n \nP 11, 2nd para: \"moral rhetoric of embryos as human\". Maybe say \"human beings\", or \n\"potential persons\" instead of \"human\" here... \"Human\" does not mean much in this \nparticular context. When you cut off a finger it is also human, but an embryo has an \nadditional quality to it \n \n\u2018Beings\u2019 has now been added (p. 11, paragraph 3).  \n \nP19, 6th line from top: What do the authors mean with their statement that \"the \nmorality of cloning was very prominent across the different methods...\"? Do they \nmean \"the question of morality\"? But even if that is the case, I suggest to be more \nspecific. \n \n\u2018Question of\u2019 has now been added into this phrase (p. 19, paragraph 2).  \n \nA purely aesthetic remark at the end: I am happy that the authors decided to delete the \nword \u201ecomplexity\" in the title; however, they might also consider working around \nusing the word \"towards\" twice. \n \nThe title has been changed with the second \u2018towards\u2019 now \u2018concerning\u2019. \n \n* Response to Review*\nReviewer #2  \n \nIn re Concern 1: Although the authors have added considerable verbiage, their \nretention of all of the problematic passages retains original fuzziness between media \nas causal influence and media as resource.  In fact, the additional verbiage actually \nmakes the main intention fuzzier.  If the intention of the manuscript is indeed the last \nsentence of the first paragraph on page five, the authors may want to revise this \nsection to dele the problematic passages and move this sentence to the end of the \nsection, thus giving it prominence and allowing the reader to see clearly that this is the \npoint. \n \nAs suggested, the sentence has been moved to the end of the Introduction to form \npart of the aims of the paper and therefore giving it more prominence (p. 5, final \nparagraph). It has also been expanded to make the point more clearly.  \n \nIn re Concern 3b: The authors' statement that readers can request the full vignettes \naddresses part of the concern.  However, there still is no address to whether the \nvignettes were piloted to control for different perceptions that could be encoded in the \nmessages because of their language and\/or value structure.  This is a simple question \nof a manipulation check to determine no undue influence because of structure rather \nthan content.  If the authors have this evidence, a simple statement that a manipulation \ncheck was performed and that the vignette's language\/structure was not the cause of \ndifference but that the content was the cause is sufficient.  If they do not, this is a \nlimitation that should be noted. This limitation could be addressed in one or two \nsentences in the discussion and conclusion section. \n \nThe method section now includes a sentence on the checks made on the \ncomparability of the vignettes (p. 7, end of paragraph following bullet points).  \n \nIn re Concern 4: This is an editor's call.  My preference would be to give a little extra \nspace to this paper so that the authors could present some analysis (a sentence or two \nper selection for a total of 14 to 28 sentences) to explain their qualitative data rather \nthan relying on the interested reader to figure it out.  Perhaps some space could be \nsaved elsewhere by trimming back the overly long conclusion.  Or the editor may \nprefer to allow the \"social constructionist version of thematic analysis\" even though \nthe construction is less clear than it could be were traditional methods to be used. \n \nThis has not been changed. \n \nIn re Concern 6b: The wording in the reply to the reviewer is much more clear than \nthe wording presented in the paper.  Perhaps this wording could be used instead of the \nthat which appears in the revision.  In addition, the authors appear to recognize the \ndifficulty in the main text.  Nevertheless, they retain their self-described \"overly \nconcise summary sentence\" on page 19.  This overly concise statement still needs to \nbe elaborated, and has not yet been. \n \nPart of the wording from the original reply to the referee has now been added to \nthe paper as suggested (p. 9, end of paragraph 2).  \n \n \n"}
