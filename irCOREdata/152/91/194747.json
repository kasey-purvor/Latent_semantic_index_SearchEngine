Introduction\n[2] Momentum and energy are exchanged between the\nionospheres and magnetospheres of magnetized planets via\nthe magnetic field that links them, thus setting up large-\nscale current systems that flow between these regions. For\nthe giant planets Jupiter and Saturn, the current systems\nassociated with two main processes are important. The first\nis associated with the middle magnetosphere, where plane-\ntary angular momentum is transferred to the radially diffus-\ning magnetospheric plasma produced from internal sources\nsuch as moon surfaces and atmospheres, to maintain partial\ncorotation of the plasma with the planet [Hill, 1979; Hill et\nal., 1983a; Vasyliunas, 1983; Pontius, 1997; Saur et al.,\n2004]. The second is associated with the magnetospheric\ninteraction with the solar wind at the magnetopause bound-\nary [Hill et al., 1983b; Isbell et al., 1984], which is\ndominant at Earth (see, e.g., the review by Cowley [2000],\nand references therein).\n[3] For the Jovian system, which is the topic of the\npresent paper, the main focus of recent research has been\non middle magnetosphere currents, following the sugges-\ntion by a number of authors that Jupiter\u2019s \u2018\u2018main oval\u2019\u2019\nauroras are associated with the region of upward directed\nfield-aligned currents in the inner part of the system, carried\nby downward precipitating magnetospheric electrons\n[Bunce and Cowley, 2001; Hill, 2001; Khurana, 2001;\nSouthwood and Kivelson, 2001]. The main oval at Jupiter\nis observed to form a bright continuous ring of emission\n\u00011\u0001 latitude wide at \u000115\u0001 magnetic colatitude, which is\nrelatively steady in time [Satoh et al., 1996; Clarke et al.,\n1998, 2004; Prange\u00b4 et al., 1998; Vasavada et al., 1999;\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 110, A11209, doi:10.1029\/2005JA011237, 2005\n1Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester,\nLeicester, UK.\n2Institute of Nuclear Physics, Moscow State University, Moscow,\nRussia.\n3Observatoire de Paris, Meudon, France.\nCopyright 2005 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/05\/2005JA011237\nA11209 1 of 18\nPallier and Prange\u00b4, 2001; Grodent et al., 2003a]. Accord-\ning to magnetic models, this ring maps in the equatorial\nplane to the inner part of the middle magnetosphere, at\nradial distances of \u000120\u201330 RJ. (RJ is Jupiter\u2019s equatorial\nradius of \u000171,400 km.) Spectral analysis of the emission at\nultraviolet (UV) wavelengths shows that the emission is due\nto precipitation of electrons with energies \u000150\u2013150 keV,\nwhose number flux at the ionosphere is equivalent to field-\naligned current densities of \u00010.1\u20130.4 mA m\u00022 [Gustin et\nal., 2004].\n[4] With regard to theoretical modeling, although the\ncurrent system is implicit in the earlier calculations of Hill\n[1979] and Pontius [1997], the form of the middle magne-\ntosphere currents associated with radial outward transport\nfrom the Io plasma torus at Jupiter was first calculated\nexplicitly by Hill [2001] and Cowley and Bunce [2001]. Hill\n[2001] determined the currents in an idealized model in\nwhich a steady plasma outflow from the torus takes place in\na dipole planetary magnetic field, this representing the\noriginal model of Hill [1979]. For typical plasma parameters\nit was found that a ring of upward field-aligned current is\ncentered at \u000110\u0001 magnetic colatitude in the ionosphere, the\ncurrent then reversing to downward in a region surrounding\nthe magnetic pole if the model is taken to extend to infinity\nin the equatorial plane. The upward and downward currents\nthen close via radially outward current flow across the field\nlines in the equatorial plasma, and equatorward directed\nPedersen currents in the ionosphere. The torques associated\nwith the cross-field currents self-consistently transfer plan-\netary angular momentum from the atmosphere and coupled\nionosphere, to the outwardly diffusing equatorial plasma.\nCowley and Bunce [2001], on the other hand, employed a\nrealistic current sheet model of the middle magnetosphere\nfield, together with an empirical model of the plasma\nangular velocity based on experimental data and the results\nof Pontius [1997]. They found that use of a more realistic\npoloidal field results in upward field-aligned current densi-\nties at the ionosphere that are an order of magnitude larger\nthan for a dipole field, comparable to the observed values\nquoted above, which map to a narrow latitudinal band\naround \u000115\u0001 colatitude where the main oval auroras are\nfound. Using the kinetic theory of Knight [1973], they also\nshowed that the currents require the field-aligned accelera-\ntion of magnetospheric electrons to energies of \u0001100 keV,\nthereby producing precipitating electron energy fluxes of\nappropriate magnitude to explain the main oval UV emis-\nsions. Cowley et al. [2002, 2003a] subsequently showed\nthat similar results are obtained if self-consistently computed\nplasma angular velocity profiles are employed rather than\nempirical models, while Nichols and Cowley [2003] con-\nfirmed the general validity of the conclusions over wide but\nrealistic ranges of the system parameters. Recent develop-\nments have included the effect of feedback of the electron\nprecipitation on ionospheric conductance [Nichols and\nCowley, 2004], and the self-consistent inclusion of the\naccelerating field-aligned voltages in the dynamical prob-\nlem where it is shown that these produce only small\neffects in the Jovian context [Nichols and Cowley, 2005].\nA ubiquitous feature of these realistic middle magneto-\nsphere models, however, is that the field-aligned current\nis found to be directed upward from the ionosphere to the\nmagnetosphere throughout the region, being concentrated\ninto the inner part, mapping to \u000120\u201340 RJ in the\nequatorial plane, when conductance feedback effects are\nincluded. The question of current closure in the poleward\nregion, mapping to the outer magnetosphere and tail, is not\ndescribed in these models and is thus left as an open issue.\n[5] Flows and currents in the higher-latitude regions of\nJupiter\u2019s ionosphere, poleward of the main oval, have by\ncomparison been relatively little studied, though observa-\ntions show that intermittent UV emissions do occur in this\nregion [e.g., Prange\u00b4 et al., 1998; Grodent et al., 2003b].\nIndeed, Pallier and Prange\u00b4 [2001] have discussed the\npresence of faint and partial \u2018\u2018inner ovals\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018arcs,\u2019\u2019\nthe most poleward of which border an aurorally dark\nregion suggested to be the polar cap region of open field\nlines. A bright auroral \u2018\u2018spot\u2019\u2019 is also often observed near\nthe equatorward edge of this most poleward emission\nregion near magnetic noon, which has been suggested to\nbe associated with the dayside cusp [Pallier and Prange\u00b4,\n2001, 2004]. On occasion the emission from this region\nhas been observed to \u2018\u2018flare\u2019\u2019 to great intensity in the UV\n[Waite et al., 2001], and X rays can also be emitted from\nan adjacent region [Elsner et al., 2005]. Bunce et al.\n[2004] have suggested that the \u2018\u2018cusp spot\u2019\u2019 effects are\nproduced by the localized field-aligned current system\nassociated with pulsed magnetopause reconnection, in\nwhich electrons and ions are accelerated along the field\nlines in adjacent regions of upward and downward directed\nfield-aligned current.\n[6] A qualitative overall picture of the plasma flow and\ncurrents in the Jovian polar ionosphere incorporating these\nfeatures has recently been presented by Cowley et al.\n[2003b]. In this picture the plasma rigidly corotates with\nthe planet at lower latitudes mapping to the inner magne-\ntosphere, the plasma angular velocity then falling with\nincreasing latitude across the region mapping to the middle\nmagnetosphere to some fraction of rigid corotation in the\nouter magnetosphere, as indicated bymagnetospheric plasma\nobservations, and then to almost stagnant conditions (in the\ninertial frame) on open field lines mapping to the tail lobes, in\nconformity with the infrared (IR) Doppler observations of\nStallard et al. [2003]. In this paper we present a quantitative\ndevelopment of this picture, simplified to conditions of\naxisymmetry for ease of theoretical development. Although\nsimplistic, this model should nevertheless represent the\nzeroth-order variations of the flow and current with latitude,\nthus allowing us for the first time to address the issue of\noverall current closure (other than in the idealized dipole field\nmodel of Hill [2001]). It also allows us to make estimates of\nthe planetary rotational energy transferred via these current\nsystems to themagnetosphere and to atmospheric heating, the\nlatter potentially contributing to an understanding of the\noutstanding issue of the elevated temperatures observed in\nthe Jovian thermosphere [Miller et al., 2000; Yelle andMiller,\n2004]. Furthermore, the model also allows an assessment of\nthe relative significance of the currents and discrete auroral\nprecipitation associated with middle magnetosphere pro-\ncesses and the solar wind interaction, though in the\naxisymmetric approximation the local time-dependent fea-\ntures associated with the cusp or \u2018\u2018substorm\u2019\u2019 currents\n(associated with time-dependent reconnection at the day-\nside magnetopause and in the tail, respectively) cannot be\nrepresented. A model of this nature was recently pre-\nA11209 COWLEY ET AL.: JOVIAN COUPLING CURRENTS\n2 of 18\nA11209\nsented by Cowley et al. [2004b] for Saturn\u2019s magneto-\nsphere-ionosphere coupling currents, based on an initial\nqualitative discussion by Cowley et al. [2004a]. In this\ncase the results indicate that auroral processes at Saturn\nare dominated by the solar wind interaction rather than by\nmiddle magnetosphere effects, thus confirming the earlier\nresults of Cowley and Bunce [2003b]. Here we will\npresent a related model for Jupiter, where the opposite\nappears to be the case.\n2. Theoretical Background\n2.1. Basic Assumptions\n[7] The object of the work presented here is to develop\nthe simplest overall model that represents the zeroth-order\nflows and currents in Jupiter\u2019s polar ionosphere. The\nprincipal simplification made is that the system is axisym-\nmetric about the magnetic axis as indicated above, such that\nthe flows considered are wholly azimuthal, and can thus be\ndiscussed in terms of the degree of departure from rigid\ncorotation with the planet. While axisymmetry seems ap-\npropriate to a description of the largely rotational flows in\nthe middle magnetosphere, as assumed in all the theoretical\nstudies cited above, it is perhaps less obviously appropriate\nin the region of open field lines where only strongly\nsubcorotational flow is included in the description, and no\nrepresentation is made of the local time-dependent flows\nassociated with the Dungey cycle. However, while descrip-\ntion of some significant phenomena is thereby excluded,\nsuch as the effect of localized cusp and substorm currents as\nmentioned above, the axisymmetric approximation still\nrepresents a useful lowest-order description in this region,\nas will be discussed further below.\n[8] Four theoretical ingredients are required to develop\nthe model. The first is a model of the plasma angular\nvelocity w, defined in the ionosphere as a function of\ncolatitude qi. The functional form of w(qi) is specified at\nthe outset, based on observations, previous modeling, and\ntheory, and is used to calculated the ionospheric electric\nfield and currents. Details will be given in the following\nsection. The second is a model of Jupiter\u2019s magnetic field in\nthe current-carrying layer of the ionosphere. This layer is\ntaken to lie \u0001500 km above the 1 bar pressure level\naccording to the results of Millward et al. [2002], which\nitself lies at a polar radius of 66,854 km. We thus take a\nfixed polar ionospheric radius Ri equal to 67,350 km. In\nprinciple the polar-flattened spheroidal figure of the planet\ncould be included in the calculation, as was incorporated in\nthe Saturn model by Cowley and Bunce [2003b] and Cowley\net al. [2004b]. Here, however, we focus solely on the region\npoleward of \u000120\u0001 colatitude where corotation breaks down,\nsuch that this is a minor effect. According to the VIP4\nmagnetic model of Connerney et al. [1998], based on space-\ncraft and auroral data, the polar ionospheric magnetic field\nvaries significantly with latitude, longitude, and between\nhemispheres. Since longitude effects clearly cannot be incor-\nporated into an axisymmetric model, and since these are\ncomparable in magnitude to the latitude and hemispheric\nvariations, we have chosen instead to take the simplest\npossible model, that is, a radial field of fixed representative\nmagnitude Bi. On the basis of the VIP4 model, we have\nchosen Bi to be 1.1 \u0003 10\u00023 T. The third ingredient is a\nmodel for the ionospheric Pedersen conductance, from\nwhich the Pedersen currents can be calculated for a given\nplasma flow model. Account also has to be taken of the\neffect of thermospheric winds excited by ion-neutral\ncollisions in the Pedersen layer, as will be discussed\nfurther below. In the next section we present results for\na fixed representative value of the Pedersen conductance,\nwhile in section 4 we consider the effect of precipitation-\ninduced enhancements in the conductance in regions of\nupward field-aligned current, based on the modeling\nresults of Millward et al. [2002]. Hall currents are also\ndriven eastward for subcorotational plasma flow, but in an\naxisymmetric model these close wholly in the ionosphere\nand do not contribute to the magnetosphere-ionosphere\ncoupling considered here. The fourth and final ingredient\nis a model which relates field-aligned currents to auroral\nelectron precipitation, allowing field-aligned acceleration\nvoltages and precipitating electron energy fluxes to be\nestimated. Here, in common with previous analyses, we\nemploy the kinetic theory of Knight [1973], combined\nwith observed typical properties of the \u2018\u2018source\u2019\u2019 electrons\nin the magnetosphere.\n[9] With this introduction, we now present the basic\ntheory governing the model, specifically concerning the\nrelation of the flow and current systems, energy transfer,\nand auroral acceleration. Other items will be dealt with in\nsubsequent sections, as indicated above. Since the basic\ntheory has been discussed in several recent related papers\n[e.g., Cowley et al., 2004b], only a brief development is\nprovided here, sufficient to serve the needs of self-\ncontainment.\n2.2. Ionospheric and Field-Aligned Current Systems\n[10] Three angular velocities are introduced in the calcu-\nlation of the ionospheric currents. These are the angular\nvelocity of the planet WJ (equal to 1.76 \u0003 10\u00024 rad s\u00021), the\nangular velocity of the subcorotating plasma w, and the\nangular velocity of the neutral atmosphere in the Pedersen\nlayer, W*J, which we expect to lie intermediate between w\nand WJ due to the frictional drag of ion-neutral collisions\n[Huang and Hill, 1989]. In this case we can write for some\n0 < k < 1\nWJ \u0002 WJ*\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc k WJ \u0002 w\u00f0 \u00de; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere modeling studies presented by Millward et al. [2005]\nindicate values k \u0007 0.5 under Jovian auroral conditions. For\nsubcorotating plasma the height-integrated Pedersen current\nintensity iP is then directed equatorward in both hemi-\nspheres, given by\niP qi\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc SPEi qi\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc SPri WJ*\u0002 w\u00f0 \u00deBi; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere SP is the ionospheric Pedersen conductance (the\nPedersen conductivity integrated in height through the\nionosphere), Ei is the electric field in the neutral atmosphere\nrest frame, and ri = Ri sin qi is the perpendicular distance to\nthe axis of symmetry. Substitution of W*J from equation (1)\ninto equation (2) then yields\niP qi\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc SP*ri WJ \u0002 w\u00f0 \u00deBi; \u00f03\u00de\nA11209 COWLEY ET AL.: JOVIAN COUPLING CURRENTS\n3 of 18\nA11209\nwhere SP* is the \u2018\u2018effective\u2019\u2019 value of the ionospheric\nPedersen conductance\nSP* \u00bc 1\u0002 k\u00f0 \u00deSP; \u00f04\u00de\nreduced from the true value by the \u2018\u2018slippage\u2019\u2019 of the neutral\natmosphere from rigid corotation. Integrating in azimuth\nyields the \u2018\u2018total\u2019\u2019 ionospheric Pedersen current flowing at\ncolatitude qi\nIP qi\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 2priiP qi\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 2pSP*r2i WJ \u0002 w\u00f0 \u00deBi: \u00f05\u00de\nCurrent continuity then requires that latitudinal variations in\nIP(qi) be accompanied by field-aligned currents flowing\nbetween the ionosphere and magnetosphere. The field-\naligned current density flowing just above the ionosphere is\ngiven by\njki \u00bc \u0002 1\n2pR2i sin qi\ndIP\ndqi\n; \u00f06\u00de\nwhere the sign is applicable to the northern hemisphere\nwhere the ionospheric field points outward from the planet.\n2.3. Energy Transfer\n[11] As indicated above, one of the concerns of this study\nis to obtain overall estimates of the energy extracted from\nplanetary rotation and either transferred to the magneto-\nsphere or dissipated as heat in the upper atmosphere. The\ntotal power per unit area of ionosphere extracted from\nplanetary rotation by the above current system [e.g., Hill\net al., 1983b; Isbell et al., 1984; Hill, 2001] is given by\np \u00bc WJt \u00bc WJ riiPBi; \u00f07\u00de\nwhere t is the torque per unit area of ionosphere about the\naxis of symmetry. The torque is associated with the height-\nintegrated j \u0003 B force, which in the ionosphere is directed\n(for subcorotation) opposite to planetary rotation. Of this\ntotal, the amount transferred to the magnetosphere via the\nmagnetic field is\npM \u00bc wt \u00bc wriiPBi; \u00f08\u00de\nwhich maintains partial corotation of radially diffusing\nplasma of internal origin on closed field lines and twists the\ntail field on open field lines. The remainder\npA \u00bc WJ \u0002 w\u00f0 \u00det \u00bc WJ \u0002 w\u00f0 \u00deriiPBi; \u00f09\u00de\nis dissipated as heat in the upper atmosphere. As pointed out\nby Smith et al. [2005], the latter power consists of two\ncomponents. The first is the direct \u2018\u2018Joule heating\u2019\u2019 in the\nPedersen layer at the rate\npJ \u00bc iP \t Ei \u00bc WJ*\u0002 w\u00f0 \u00deriiPBi; \u00f010\u00de\nwhile the second is the \u2018\u2018ion drag\u2019\u2019 power associated with\nsubcorotation of the neutral atmosphere due to the torque\npD \u00bc WJ \u0002 WJ*\u00f0 \u00det \u00bc WJ \u0002 WJ*\u00f0 \u00deriiPBi; \u00f011\u00de\nwhich is viscously dissipated to heat at some level in the\natmosphere. Adding equations (10) and (11) then yields the\ntotal power per unit area dissipated to heat in the atmosphere\ngiven by equation (9).Wenote that this total power, which can\nalso be expressed as\npA \u00bc i\n2\nP\nSP*\n\u00f012\u00de\nthrough equation (3), is the quantity written as p*J by Cowley\net al. [2004b] and discussed as an upper limit to the\natmospheric Joule heating rate (at Saturn) in the limit of a\nrigidly corotating neutral atmosphere. When the \u2018\u2018ion drag\u2019\u2019\npower is added, however, this quantity also becomes the true\ntotal power per unit area dissipated to heat in the upper\natmosphere, as noted by Smith et al. [2005]. Total powers are\nthen obtained by integration of the above quantities over\nappropriate areas of the ionosphere.\n2.4. Auroral Acceleration and Energy Flux\n[12] Another concern of the study is to examine the\nmodel regions of upward field-aligned current with regard\nto acceleration of downward precipitating electrons and the\nformation of discrete auroras. The maximum current density\nthat can be carried by downward precipitating electrons\nwithout field-aligned acceleration is\njki0 \u00bc eN Wth\n2pme\n\u0001 \u00021=2\n; \u00f013\u00de\nwith a corresponding precipitating energy flux (energy per\nunit area per unit time) of\nEf 0 \u00bc 2NWth Wth\n2pme\n\u0001 \u00021=2\n: \u00f014\u00de\nIn these expressions the magnetospheric source electron\npopulation (charge e and mass me) has been assumed to be\nan isotropic Maxwellian of density N and thermal energy\nWth (equal to kBT where T is the temperature and kB is\nBoltzmann\u2019s constant) and that the precipitating population\nhas a full downward going loss cone and an empty upward\ngoing loss cone. If the upward current required by\nequation (6) is larger than jki0 given by equation (13),\nthen a field-aligned voltage must be present which\naccelerates the electrons into the ionosphere. According\nto Knight\u2019s [1973] kinetic theory, the minimum field-\naligned voltage required is\nFkmin \u00bc Wth\ne\njki\njki0\n\u0001 \u0002\n\u0002 1\n\u0001 \u0002\n; \u00f015\u00de\nthis value being appropriate if the \u2018\u2018top\u2019\u2019 of the voltage drop is\nlocated well above the minimum radial distance given by\nrmin\nRi\n\u0001 \u0002\n\u0007 jki\njki0\n\u0001 \u00021=3\n; \u00f016\u00de\nwhere we have assumed as a sufficient approximation that the\nfield strength drops as the inverse cube of the distance along\nA11209 COWLEY ET AL.: JOVIAN COUPLING CURRENTS\n4 of 18\nA11209\nthe polar field lines. Equation (15) also assumes that the\nvoltage drop is sufficiently compact along the field lines that\nelectrons do not mirror before experiencing the full voltage.\nThe enhanced precipitating electron energy flux correspond-\ning to equation (15) is then\nEf \u00bc Ef 0\n2\njki\njki0\n\u0001 \u00022\n\u00fe1\n !\n; \u00f017\u00de\nfollowing Lundin and Sandahl [1978]. Here we will thus\nemploy equations (15)\u2013(17) to estimate the electron\nacceleration conditions and precipitating energy fluxes in\nregions of upward field-aligned current, using typical\nobserved values of the magnetospheric electron source\nparameters.\n[13] We also wish to estimate the UV auroral output from\nthe precipitating electron input, both with regard to auroral\nbrightness (photon flux) and total energy. The auroras are\nexcited by primary and secondary electron impact on\natmospheric atomic andmolecular hydrogen, which produces\n\u000110 eV UV photons, corresponding to the atomic hydrogen\nLyman alpha line and the molecular hydrogen Lyman and\nWerner bands. The overall energy efficiency of these pro-\ncesses is \u000115% [Waite et al., 1983; Rego et al., 1994], such\nthat 1 mWm\u00022 of precipitating electron input yields\u000110 kR\nof UV photon production in the auroral atmosphere.\nHowever, part of this photon flux is absorbed by hydro-\ncarbons overlying the auroral source, such that the\nemergent UV flux will generally be less than this,\ndepending on the altitude of production and hence on\nthe energy of the primary auroral electrons. For 1 mWm\u00022 of\ninput power, such absorption reduces the UVoutput to\u00018 kR\nin the case of 10 keV electron primaries and to \u00013 kR\nfor 100 keV primaries.\n3. Jupiter Model With Constant Ionospheric\nConductance\n3.1. Plasma Angular Velocity Model\n[14] The most significant input to our calculation is the\nchoice of plasma angular velocity model, which is specified\nat the outset on the basis of observations, previous model-\ning, and theory. In keeping with the overall objectives\noutlined in section 2.1 above, our aim has been to develop\nthe simplest model that reasonably describes the large-scale\nplasma flow. As in the corresponding Saturn model [Cowley\net al., 2004b], we consider the flow in four regions. With\nincreasing latitude in the ionosphere, these correspond to the\ninner, middle, and outer magnetosphere on closed field\nlines, and the open field region mapping to the tail. In this\ncontext, the \u2018\u2018inner\u2019\u2019 magnetosphere is taken to be the\nregion where the plasma near-rigidly corotates with the\nplanet, extending in the equatorial plane to radial distances\nof \u000120 RJ [Belcher, 1983; Sands and McNutt, 1988;\nNichols and Cowley, 2004]. According to empirical mag-\nnetic models, this equatorial distance maps in the iono-\nsphere to a colatitude of \u000116\u0001 [e.g., Connerney et al., 1981;\nNichols and Cowley, 2004]. We thereby do not include in\nthe model the minor departures from rigid corotation in the\nIo plasma torus itself at larger colatitudes (\u000123\u0001), which are\ndue to local plasma production and pickup [e.g., Pontius\nand Hill, 1982; Brown, 1994]. Nor do we include the larger\nbut more localized effects associated with the direct moon-\nplasma interactions [e.g., Hill and Vasyliunas, 2002]. Be-\nyond \u000120 RJ in the equatorial plane the plasma angular\nvelocity then falls continuously with increasing radial\ndistance across the middle magnetosphere (the region con-\ntaining the azimuthal equatorial current sheet), reaching\nsome fraction of rigid corotation at its outer edge at radial\ndistances of several tens of RJ, depending on solar wind\nconditions and the state of extension of the magnetosphere.\nFor the relatively compressed magnetosphere observed by\nVoyager 2, Kane et al. [1995] found plasma angular\nvelocities of around half of rigid corotation at the outer\nedge of the middle magnetosphere on the dayside inbound\npass (at \u000145 RJ), while at a similar local time Laxton et al.\n[1997] found lower angular velocities of around a quarter of\nrigid corotation for the more extended magnetosphere\nobserved by Ulysses (at \u000170 RJ). Realistic middle magne-\ntosphere models typically provide values within the same\nrange at these distances [e.g., Nichols and Cowley, 2004], as\ndo more recent experimental estimates based on Galileo\ndata [Krupp et al., 2001]. The latter data also suggest a\ndawn-dusk local time asymmetry with higher flow speeds at\ndawn compared with dusk, though this cannot be repre-\nsented within the axisymmetric framework adopted here.\nWe will, however, consider two representative models in\nwhich the flow falls either to a half or to a quarter of rigid\ncorotation at the outer edge of the middle magnetosphere.\nWe may then consider these models to represent either a\ncompressed or an expanded system, respectively, since\ngenerally we would expect higher angular velocities to\nprevail in a more compressed system [Southwood and\nKivelson, 2001; Cowley and Bunce, 2003a]. Empirical\nmagnetic models then indicate that the outer edge of the\nmiddle magnetosphere maps in the ionosphere to a colati-\ntude of \u000115\u0001, that is, the fall in angular velocity across the\nmiddle magnetosphere takes place over \u00011\u0001 of colatitude in\nthe ionosphere between \u000115\u0001 and \u000116\u0001, in conformity with\nprevious studies [Cowley et al., 2002; Nichols and Cowley,\n2003, 2004]. The amount of magnetic flux threading the\ncurrent sheet between \u000120 RJ and its outer edge at several\ntens of RJ is thus \u0001150 GWb.\n[15] The outer magnetosphere in this model then corre-\nsponds to the layer of magnetic flux adjacent to the\nmagnetopause where no azimuthal current sheet is evident,\nwhich Cowley et al. [2003b] have proposed is formed by the\nreturn flow of closed flux tubes from the tail to the dayside\nmagnetopause, principally via dawn, in the Dungey cycle.\nThe nature of this layer will thus depend on local time,\nthough this also cannot be represented directly. Instead we\nrepresent the outer magnetosphere as a layer of approxi-\nmately uniform angular velocity located poleward of the\nmain oval. In the corresponding Saturn model [Cowley et\nal., 2004b], evidence from Voyager data suggested that the\nangular velocities in this layer somewhat exceeded that of\nthe outer middle magnetosphere. However, available evi-\ndence at Jupiter suggests instead that angular velocities in\nthe two regions are comparable with each other [e.g., Kane\net al., 1995]. For simplicity therefore we take the flow in the\nouter magnetosphere to plateau at the value in the outer\nmiddle magnetosphere, at a half and a quarter of rigid\ncorotation in our two models, respectively, and to extend\nA11209 COWLEY ET AL.: JOVIAN COUPLING CURRENTS\n5 of 18\nA11209\nat these values to the open-closed field line boundary (i.e.,\nthe magnetopause). The colatitude of the latter boundary\nrelates to the amount of open flux in the tail, which is\nprobably a somewhat variable quantity depending on inter-\nplanetary conditions and the solar wind interaction. Here we\ntake the open flux in the system to be 500 GWb, compa-\nrable with but somewhat larger than the \u0001320 GWb\nemployed in the magnetic models presented by Alexeev\nand Belenkaya [2005] and Belenkaya et al. [2005]. With the\nvalue of 500 GWb, the (axisymmetric) open-closed field\nline boundary then lies at a colatitude of \u000110.25\u0001 in the\nionosphere. The flux in the outer magnetosphere, between\nthe open-closed boundary and the outer limit of the middle\nmagnetosphere at \u000115\u0001, is then a further \u0001500 GWb. The\nopen flux corresponds, for example, to a tail field of\u00011.5 nT\nin a lobe of radius \u0001200 RJ, while the outer magnetosphere\nflux corresponds to a field of \u000110 nT in a layer which is\n\u000115 RJ wide adjacent to the magnetopause. Such values\ndo not seem unreasonable in terms of observations [e.g.,\nAcun\u02dca et al., 1983].\n[16] Within the region of open field lines the flow has two\ncomponents, rotation driven by ion-neutral collisions in the\nionosphere which twists the open tail field lines, and the\nflow associated with the Dungey cycle. The degree to which\nthe open field lines rotate within the tail is a matter of some\nuncertainty at present and has been discussed, for example,\nby Belenkaya [2004]. Here, however, we follow the de-\nscription of Isbell et al. [1984], whose analysis using a\nsimplified geometry suggests that the rotation takes place at\na uniform angular velocity in the inertial frame given by\nw\nWJ\n\u0001 \u0002\n\u00bc m0SP*VSW\n1\u00fe m0SP*VSW\n; \u00f018\u00de\nwhere m0 is the permeability of free space and VSW is the\nvelocity of the solar wind. The fixed value of SP* that will be\nemployed in this section is 0.2 mho, as will be discussed\nfurther below. With this value we have m0SP* VSW \u0007 0.1 for a\nsolar wind speed of 400 km s\u00021 so that (w\/WJ) \u0007 0.09 in the\nopen field region. That is, the flow within this region is\nstrongly subcorotational, in conformity with the almost\n\u2018\u2018stagnant\u2019\u2019 plasma conditions observed in IR Doppler data\nin the high-latitude \u2018\u2018dark polar region\u2019\u2019 [Stallard et al.,\n2003]. With this value for the angular velocity, the plasma\nflow at the outer boundary of the open field region, for\nexample, is\u0001200 m s\u00021, compared with\u00012 km s\u00021 for rigid\ncorotation. We cannot include the local time-dependent\nDungey cycle flow within our axisymmetric model but note\nthat Cowley et al. [2003b] have estimated the antisunward\nflow to be only \u000150\u2013100 m s\u00021 on open field lines under\ntypical conditions. These flows are therefore at most\ncomparable with the subcorotational flow in the inertial\nframe and do not affect the conclusion of near-stagnant\nplasma conditions in this region. The ionospheric current,\nhowever, is determined by the plasma flow in the neutral\natmosphere rest frame, such that the most significant effect is\nthe strongly subcorotational nature of the flow as described by\nthe model. The Dungey cycle flow, which is not included,\nthen represents only a small correction.\n[17] With increasing colatitude from the pole therefore\nthe angular velocity in our model increases monotonically\nfrom \u000110% of rigid corotation on open field lines to full\nrigid corotation equatorward of \u000116\u0001, in two steps. The\nfirst increase corresponds to the open-closed field line\nboundary and the second to the middle magnetosphere\n(outside \u000120 RJ). The convenient functional form chosen\nto represent this behavior is\nw qi\u00f0 \u00de\nWJ\n\u0001 \u0002\n\u00bc w\nWJ\n\u0001 \u0002\nOpen\n\u00fe 1\n2\nw\nWJ\n\u0001 \u0002\nOM\n\u0005\n\u0002 w\nWJ\n\u0001 \u0002\nOpen\n#\n1\u00fe tanh qi \u0002 qiOC\nDqiOC\n\u0001 \u0002\u0005 \u0007\n\u00fe 1\n2\n1\u0002 w\nWJ\n\u0001 \u0002\nOM\n\u0005 \u0007\n1\u00fe tanh qi \u0002 qiMM\nDqiMM\n\u0001 \u0002\u0005 \u0007\n; \u00f019\u00de\nwhere (w\/WJ)Open is the angular velocity on open field lines,\ntaken to be the Isbell et al. [1984] value given by equation (18)\nfor the chosen value of the conductance SP* = 0.2 mho and\nVSW = 400 km s\n\u00021 (giving (w\/WJ)Open\u0007 0.091), and (w\/WJ)OM\nis the angular velocity in the outer magnetosphere to which\nthe angular velocity in the middle magnetosphere falls at its\nouter edge, taken to be 0.25 and 0.5 in our two models as\ndiscussed above. The position and width of the change in\nangular velocity across the middle magnetosphere are\ngoverned by parameters qiMM and DqiMM, respectively. We\ntake these to have the values of 15.5\u0001 and 0.4\u0001, respectively, so\nthat the principal change in angular velocity takes place over\n\u00011\u0001 of colatitude, between \u000115\u0001 and \u000116\u0001, also in\nconformity with the above discussion. Similarly, the change\nin angular velocity between (w\/WJ)Open and (w\/WJ)OM across\nthe boundary of open field lines is governed by qiOC and\nDqiOC. The position of the open-closed field line boundary,\nqiOC, is chosen such that the amount of open flux enclosed is\n500 GWb as above, giving qiOC \u0007 10.25\u0001. With regard to\nDqiOC, the open-closed field line boundary itself has zero\nwidth, of course, since field lines are either open or closed.\nHowever, DqiOC actually determines the finite width of the\nfield-aligned current region flowing at the boundary, which,\nin conformity with our related Saturn model [Cowley et al.,\n2004a, 2004b] we may reasonably take to be a few hundred\nkilometers in latitudinal extent. Here therefore we take\nDqiOC = 0.125\u0001, such that the width of the boundary region,\nroughly \u00013DqiOC, is \u0001450 km at ionospheric heights. With\nthese parameters, the angular velocity models obtained from\nequation (19) are shown in Figure 1a, plotted from the pole to\n20\u0001 colatitude. The solid and dashed lines show the models\nwith (w\/WJ)OM equal to 0.25 and 0.5, respectively. These will\nbe referred to as the \u2018\u2018low\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018high\u2019\u2019 angular velocity\nmodels, respectively, in the discussion below, possibly\nreflecting expanded or compressed magnetospheric condi-\ntions as previously mentioned.\n[18] In Figure 1b we also show the corresponding profiles\nof the electrostatic potential Fi(qi) in the inertial frame,\nobtained by integrating\ndFi\ndqi\n\u00bc BiR2i sin qi w qi\u00f0 \u00de; \u00f020\u00de\nwhere we have taken the arbitrary zero of potential to lie at\nthe pole, qi = 0\u0001. The solid and dashed lines again show the\npotentials for the \u2018\u2018low\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018high\u2019\u2019 angular velocity\nmodels, respectively, while the dotted line corresponds to\nrigid corotation at all colatitudes, for purposes of compar-\nison. Owing to the essentially common angular velocity in\nA11209 COWLEY ET AL.: JOVIAN COUPLING CURRENTS\n6 of 18\nA11209\nthe open field region in our two models (Figure 1a), the\ndashed and solid lines are distinguishable only beyond the\nopen-closed field line boundary at \u000110.25\u0001. The voltage\nthus rises from zero at the pole to \u00011.3 MV at the open-\nclosed boundary in both cases, and then to \u00016 and \u000110 MV\nin the middle magnetosphere regions of the \u2018\u2018low\u2019\u2019 and\n\u2018\u2018high\u2019\u2019 angular velocity models, respectively, before\nincreasing to \u000127 and \u000131 MV, respectively, at the 20\u0001\ncolatitude boundary of the plot. These results for the field-\nperpendicular voltage will be compared with the field-\naligned voltages required by auroral acceleration in section\n3.4 below.\n3.2. Pedersen Current and Energy Transfer\n[19] Given the plasma angular velocity model, we can\nnow use equation (3) to determine the height-integrated\nPedersen current intensity, once a value of the effective\nPedersen conductance has been chosen. This is not a well-\ndetermined parameter, but has been chosen to have the\nvalue SP* = 0.2 mho for a number of reasons. First, the value\nis reasonably in line with estimates based on ionospheric\nmodels [e.g., Strobel and Atreya, 1983]. Second, when\nemployed in self-consistent middle magnetosphere models\nwith realistic Io plasma mass outflow rates, it results in\nreasonably realistic angular velocity profiles [e.g., Hill,\n2001; Cowley and Bunce, 2002]. Third, when employed\nin the Isbell et al. [1984] formula (equation (18)), it yields\n\u2018\u2018stagnant\u2019\u2019 flow conditions on open field lines in confor-\nmity with the results of Stallard et al. [2003]. Fourth, and\nmost definitively with regard to the present model, when\ncombined with the angular velocity models given by equa-\ntion (19), it yields total Pedersen currents at the poleward\nboundary of the middle magnetosphere region of \u000150 MA\nper hemisphere, thus implying that the total radial current\nflowing in the equatorial plane in the outer region of the\nmiddle magnetosphere current sheet is \u0001100 MA. This is in\nline with Galileo magnetic observations [Khurana, 2001;\nNichols and Cowley, 2004], and ensures that the overall\ncurrents flowing in the model are realistic.\n[20] Using this value therefore, in Figure 2a we show the\nheight-integrated Pedersen current intensity versus colatitude\nfor the \u2018\u2018low\u2019\u2019 (solid line) and \u2018\u2018high\u2019\u2019 (dashed line) angular\nvelocity models. It can be seen that the current intensity\nincreases near-linearly within the region of open field lines to\nreach a peak value of\u00010.4Am\u00021 at the boundary. This is due\nto the near-constant angular velocity of the plasma in this\nregion, such that the actual velocity of the plasma (in the\nneutral atmosphere rest frame), and hence the electric field\nand current, increase linearly with distance from themagnetic\naxis (see equation (3)). Across the open field line boundary\nthe current then drops as the angular velocity increases\nsomewhat toward rigid corotation, more so for the \u2018\u2018high\u2019\u2019\nangular velocity model than for the \u2018\u2018low\u2019\u2019 angular velocity\nmodel, following which the current rises again due to a\ncorresponding effect in the outer magnetosphere region.\nFinally, the current intensity falls precipitously to zero across\nthe middle magnetosphere region as the angular velocity of\nthe plasma increases to approach rigid corotation.\n[21] Using equations (8) and (9), we can also compute the\nplanetary power per unit area that is transferred by the current\nsystem to atmospheric heating and to the magnetosphere.\nThese are shown in Figures 2b and 2c, respectively, plotted\nversus colatitude on the same vertical scales, so that they may\nreadily be compared. It can be seen that on open field lines\nthe power is fed mainly into atmospheric heating. Integration\nover the whole open field region yields a total power input to\nthe atmosphere (per hemisphere) of\u0001200 TW, with\u000120 TW\nbeing expended in twisting the field in the tail lobe. On\nclosed field lines the distribution is somewhat more even,\nwith \u0001540 and \u0001240 TW being dissipated (per hemisphere)\nin the atmosphere, and\u0001230 and\u0001270 TW being transferred\nto the magnetospheric plasma, in the \u2018\u2018low\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018high\u2019\u2019\nangular velocity models, respectively. These relative values\ndirectly reflect the angular velocity models, since it is readily\nseen from equations (8) and (9) that\npM\npA\n\u00bc w\nWJ \u0002 w\u00f0 \u00de ; \u00f021\u00de\nFigure 1.

Overall, in the \u2018\u2018low\u2019\u2019 angular velocity\nmodel \u0001740 TW is input to the upper atmosphere and\n\u0001250 TW to the magnetosphere (per hemisphere), while\nin the \u2018\u2018high\u2019\u2019 angular velocity model \u0001440 TW is input\nto the upper atmosphere and \u0001290 TW to the magneto-\nsphere. These results are collected and summarized in\nTable 1. It will be noted that the powers are more than\ntwo orders of magnitude higher than the globally\naveraged input of solar EUV energy into Jupiter\u2019s\nthermosphere (\u00011 TW) [e.g., Yelle and Miller, 2004]. It\nthus seems reasonable to suppose that atmospheric heating\ndue to magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling may make a\nsignificant contribution to a resolution of the issue of why\nJupiter\u2019s thermosphere is over five times hotter than expected\nfor solar EUV input alone (\u0001940 K observed compared with\n\u0001160 K expected [e.g., Yelle and Miller, 2004]).\n3.3. Total Pedersen Current and Field-Aligned Current\n[22] We now consider the variations of the total Pedersen\ncurrent given by equation (5) and the field-aligned current\nthat is required by its divergence given by equation (6). The\ntotal Pedersen current for the two angular velocity models is\nshown versus colatitude in Figure 3a. It can be seen that the\nequatorward current grows approximately as the square of\nthe distance from the axis within the open field region, due\nto the approximately linear growth of the height-integrated\ncurrent intensity in this region seen in Figure 2a, reaching\n\u000130 MA at the open field line boundary. This requires an\napproximately uniform downward field-aligned current\nthroughout this region. The total Pedersen current then falls\nacross the open field boundary as the angular velocity rises\nin the outer magnetosphere, by \u00013 MA for the \u2018\u2018low\u2019\u2019\nangular velocity model, for which the angular velocity\nincrease is least, and by \u000112 MA for the \u2018\u2018high\u2019\u2019 angular\nvelocity model, for which the increase is larger. Field-\naligned currents of these magnitudes must therefore flow\nup the field lines in the boundary region. The Pedersen\ncurrent then grows again across the outer magnetosphere,\nrequiring downward field-aligned current in this region,\nbefore peaking at \u000150 and \u000135 MA for the \u2018\u2018low\u2019\u2019 and\n\u2018\u2018high\u2019\u2019 angular velocity models, respectively, at the outer\nboundary of the middle magnetosphere. The current then\nfalls rapidly to zero as the near-rigid corotation condition is\napproached across the middle magnetosphere, thus requir-\ning the above peak currents to exit the ionosphere along the\nfield lines across this region.\n[23] The field-aligned current profiles derived from equa-\ntion (6) are then shown in Figure 3b, where positive values\nrepresent currents directed upward out of the ionosphere. As\nanticipated in the above discussion, the currents are directed\ndownward into the ionosphere throughout the open field\nregion and in the outer magnetosphere, with almost constant\nvalues of \u00010.07 mA m\u00022 in the open field region, and \u00010.06\nTable 1.

Relatively\nnarrow rings of upward field-aligned current then flow at the\nopen field boundary and in the middle magnetosphere\nregion. With the model parameters chosen, for the \u2018\u2018low\u2019\u2019\nangular velocity model the upward current density peaks at\n\u00010.2 mAm\u00022 at the open field boundary and at\u00010.5 mAm\u00022\nin the middle magnetosphere, while for the \u2018\u2018high\u2019\u2019\nangular velocity model the balance is reversed, with the\nupward current density peaking at \u00010.6 mA m\u00022 at the\nopen field boundary and at \u00010.4 mA m\u00022 in the middle\nmagnetosphere. The overall latitudinal width of these\nupward current regions are \u00010.4\u0001 and \u00011.5\u0001, respectively,\ncorresponding to distances of \u0001450 and \u00011800 km at\nionospheric heights.\n3.4. Auroral Electron Acceleration and Precipitated\nEnergy Flux\n[24] We now employ the theoretical results given in\nsection 2.4 above, based on Knight [1973], to consider the\nauroral emissions that are expected to be associated with the\nregions of upward field-aligned current. These depend not\nonly on the current density values themselves but also on\nthe properties of the magnetospheric electron population\nthat provides the source of the downward precipitating\nparticles. The source parameters employed, and quantities\nderived from them, are collected together in Table 2. We\nhave used three different source populations, corresponding\nto the middle magnetosphere, the outer magnetosphere, and\nthe magnetosheath. The latter two are both applied to the\nupward current flowing at the open field boundary, it being\nrecognized that this current may flow partially on open\n(magnetosheath) and partially on closed (outer magneto-\nsphere) field lines. For the middle magnetosphere, the\nelectron density N and the thermal energy Wth are taken\nto be 0.01 cm\u00023 and 2.5 keV, respectively, in conformity\nwith the Voyager observations of Scudder et al. [1981] and\nprevious modeling studies [e.g., Cowley et al., 2001;\nNichols and Cowley, 2004]. From equation (13) this gives\na limiting current density in the absence of field-aligned\nacceleration jki0 of \u00010.013 mA m\u00022 (Table 2), which we\nnote is much less than the model upward current densities\nthroughout essentially the whole of the middle magneto-\nsphere region, thus implying a general requirement for\ndownward electron acceleration in this region. The\nunaccelerated precipitating electron energy flux Ef0 from\nequation (14) is then \u00010.067 mW m\u00022 (Table 2), which\ncorresponds to a sub-kR UV auroral emission (below the\n\u00011 kR sensitivity of existing observational techniques).\nThe corresponding values employed for the outer\nmagnetosphere are 0.02 cm\u00023 and 250 eV, giving a\nlimiting current density and energy flux of \u00010.0085 mA m\u00022\nand \u00010.0042 mW m\u00022, while for the magnetosheath we\nemploy 0.5 cm\u00023 and 50 eV, giving a limiting current density\nand energy flux of \u00010.095 mA m\u00022 and \u00010.0095 mW m\u00022.\nThese values are based on the Ulysses thermal electron data\npresented by Phillips et al. [1993a, 1993b], as employed in\nprevious modeling studies of the Jovian cusp by Bunce et al.\n[2004]. We note that the limiting currents of both plasma\ncomponents are less than the peak upward currents at the open\nfield boundary for both models, thus also implying electron\nacceleration in all cases, though only marginally so for\nmagnetosheath electrons in the \u2018\u2018low\u2019\u2019 angular velocity\nmodel. We also note that the unaccelerated energy fluxes in\nboth cases are less than those deduced for the middle\nmagnetosphere source and hence would also not give rise to\ndetectable UVemissions.\n[25] Results are shown in Figure 4, where the upper,\nmiddle, and lower panels show the minimum accelerating\nvoltages obtained from equation (15), the minimum radial\ndistances of the acceleration region from equation (16), and\nthe precipitating energy fluxes of accelerated particles, re-\nspectively. In each case we focus on a restricted range of\nFigure 3.

As in Figure 1, the\nsolid line shows values for the \u2018\u2018low\u2019\u2019 angular velocity\nmodel, while the dashed line shows values for the \u2018\u2018high\u2019\u2019\nangular velocity model.\nTable 2.

The format of the plots follows\nthat employed previously, where solid and dashed lines\nshow values for the \u2018\u2018low\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018high\u2019\u2019 angular velocity\nmodels, respectively, specifically for the outer magneto-\nsphere source plasma at the open-closed field boundary.\nCorresponding results for the magnetosheath source plasma\nare shown by the dot-dashed line for the \u2018\u2018low\u2019\u2019 angular\nvelocity model and by the dotted line for the \u2018\u2018high\u2019\u2019 angular\nvelocity model.\n[26] If we examine the middle magnetosphere region first,\nit can be seen from Figure 4a that minimum accelerating\nvoltages peak at \u0001100 and \u000160 kV for the \u2018\u2018low\u2019\u2019 and\n\u2018\u2018high\u2019\u2019 angular velocity models, respectively, thus implying\nprecipitating energetic primary electron beams at essentially\nthese energies. Such auroral electron energies are entirely\ncomparable with those deduced from main oval UV spectra\nby Gustin et al. [2004]. We note from Figure 1b that such\nfield-aligned voltages correspond to values which are only\n\u00011% of the field-perpendicular voltage between the pole\nand the middle magnetosphere, thus implying only small\npoleward displacements of the electric equipotentials across\nthe field lines in the auroral acceleration region [see also\nCowley and Bunce, 2001; Nichols and Cowley, 2005]. The\ncorresponding energy fluxes in Figure 4c peak at \u000150 and\n\u000120 mW m\u00022, respectively, associated with unabsorbed UV\nauroral emissions of \u0001500 and \u0001200 kR. According to the\ndiscussion in section 2.4, hydrocarbon absorption will then\nreduce these values by factors of 2\u20133, to\u0001200 and\u0001100 kR,\nrespectively, at the primary electron energies involved. The\nobserved brightness of themain oval typically varies between\n\u000150 and \u0001300 kR [e.g., Grodent et al., 2003a; Gustin et al.,\n2004], these values thus being vary comparable with those\ndeduced here. The total power input to the Jovian atmosphere\nassociated with this precipitation can also be derived by\nintegrating the energy flux over the whole middle mag-\nnetosphere region. The powers obtained are \u00013.6 and\n\u00011.6 TW per hemisphere for the \u2018\u2018low\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018high\u2019\u2019\nangular velocity models, respectively, thus again being\ncomparable to typical values deduced from auroral obser-\nvations [e.g., Grodent et al., 2003a, 2003b; Clarke et al.,\n2004]. Overall therefore it seems reasonable to conclude\nthat the precipitation characteristics in the middle magne-\ntosphere region in the model are compatible with obser-\nvations of the Jovian main oval emissions, in conformity\nwith previous conclusions [e.g., Cowley and Bunce, 2001;\nCowley et al., 2002, 2003a; Nichols and Cowley, 2004].\nFigure 4b also shows that the minimum radial distance of\nthe acceleration region is \u00013\u20133.5 RJ in both models,\nsuch that the accelerated primary electron beams may\nform the source of cyclotron emissions underneath the\nacceleration region at frequencies \u00011 \u2013 30 MHz,\ncorresponding mainly to \u2018\u2018non-Io-DAM\u2019\u2019 radio emissions\n(see, e.g., the review by Clarke et al. [2004]).\n[27] Our model shows, however, that Jovian auroral\nemissions may also occur at smaller colatitudes, associated\nwith the open-closed field line boundary. Using the outer\nmagnetosphere electron source, the minimum accelerating\nvoltages peak at \u00015 and \u000115 kV for the \u2018\u2018low\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018high\u2019\u2019\nangular velocity models, with peak energy fluxes of \u00011 and\n\u000110 mW m\u00022, respectively. These field-aligned voltages\nagain correspond to \u00011% of the voltage drop between the\nFigure 4. Auroral parameters for the constant conductance\nJupiter models, based on the field-aligned current density\nprofiles shown in Figure 3 (specifically in regions of\nupward field-aligned current), and the magnetospheric\nsource electron parameters given in Table 2. The panels\nshow (a) the minimum value of the field-aligned accelerat-\ning voltage given by equation (15), (b) the minimum radial\ndistance of the acceleration region, normalized to the\nionospheric radial distance Ri, given by equation (16), and\n(c) the precipitating electron energy flux given by\nequation (17). The plot shows the colatitude range\ncontaining the regions of upward directed field-aligned\ncurrent, between 7.5\u0001 and 17.5\u0001. As in previous figures,\nthe solid line shows values for the \u2018\u2018low\u2019\u2019 angular\nvelocity model, while the dashed line shows values for\nthe \u2018\u2018high\u2019\u2019 angular velocity model, specifically assuming\nthe outer magnetosphere source parameters in the vicinity\nof the open-closed field line boundary near \u000110.25\u0001.\nValues for the magnetosheath source parameters are\nshown by the dot-dashed and dotted lines for the\n\u2018\u2018low\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018high\u2019\u2019 angular velocity models, respectively.\nA11209 COWLEY ET AL.: JOVIAN COUPLING CURRENTS\n10 of 18\nA11209\npole and the open-closed field line boundary (Figure 1b),\nthus again implying only very small cross-field displace-\nments of the electric equipotentials. The energy fluxes\ncorrespond to UV auroral intensities of \u000110 and \u0001100 kR,\nrespectively, and hence to auroras which, while being clearly\nobservable, are generally less bright than those of the main\noval (the effect of hydrocarbon absorption at \u000110 keV\nprimary electron energies being small according to the dis-\ncussion in section 2.4). Although the currents flowing in the\nopen field boundary are comparable to those of the middle\nmagnetosphere region in our model, and hence so are the\nprecipitating electron number fluxes, the mean energy of the\naccelerated electrons, \u000110 keV, is significantly less than for\nthe middle magnetosphere, \u0001100 keV, due to the lower\ntemperature of the magnetospheric electron source popula-\ntion (Table 2). Thus the total precipitating electron power\nintegrated over the whole boundary region is also signif-\nicantly less, being \u000110 and \u0001140 GW (per hemisphere)\nfor the \u2018\u2018low\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018high\u2019\u2019 angular velocity models,\nrespectively, assuming that the whole of the current is\ncarried by outer magnetosphere electrons. The values are\neven smaller assuming the cool dense magnetosheath\nsource, with accelerating voltages from a few tens to a\nfew hundred volts, and energy fluxes from a few tenths\nto a few hundredths of a mW m\u00022. The total precipitating\nelectron powers in this case are \u00010.3 and \u00013 GW (per\nhemisphere) for the \u2018\u2018low\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018high\u2019\u2019 angular velocity\nmodels, again assuming that the whole of the current is\ncarried by magnetosheath electrons. These total precipi-\ntating electron power values are also collected together in\nTable 3. In general, however, we may suppose that part\nof the boundary current will be carried by outer magne-\ntosphere electrons (some lower-latitude portion), and part\nby magnetosheath electrons (some higher-latitude por-\ntion). In this case, the emission at the boundary will\ngenerally be dominated by that fraction at lower latitudes\nwhich is carried by outer magnetosphere electrons.\n[28] Overall, the results show that while our model is\ncertainly consistent with the appearance of discrete auro-\nral emissions associated with the open-closed field line\nboundary at high latitudes, the Jovian auroral emissions\nwill be dominated by those associated with the middle\nmagnetosphere. The difference between the auroral\npowers in the two regions is the most marked for our\n\u2018\u2018low\u2019\u2019 angular velocity model, possibly representing an\nexpanded magnetosphere, in which the increase in plasma\nangular velocity at the open field line boundary is much\nless than that across the middle magnetosphere (Figure 1a).\nHowever, for our \u2018\u2018high\u2019\u2019 angular velocity model, possibly\nrepresenting a more compressed magnetosphere, the change\nin angular velocity across the open field boundary is in-\ncreased, while that across themiddle magnetosphere region is\nreduced, such that the changes across the two regions become\ncomparable. This has the effect of reducing the accelerating\nvoltages and auroral emissions in the middle magnetosphere\nregion, in conformity with the general conclusions of Cowley\nand Bunce [2003a], while increasing them in the open field\nboundary region. With regard to observations, the power of\nthe Jovian auroras observed poleward of the main oval is\nindeed found to be much smaller than that of the main oval, in\nconformity with the above general conclusions. Quantita-\ntively, however, the polar UV power is found to corre-\nspond to an electron energy input per hemisphere of\n\u0001500 GW, \u000120% of the main oval energy input [e.g.,\nGrodent et al., 2003b], which is considerably larger than\nthe model estimates made above (\u000110 and \u0001140 GW).\nPerhaps not surprisingly therefore our simple axisymmet-\nric model appears to provide only a partial explanation of\nthe auroral precipitation observed poleward of the main\noval. The most likely component which may correspond\nto our currents at the open field boundary are the most\npoleward emissions that border the aurorally dark region\non their poleward side [Pallier and Prange\u00b4, 2001, 2004].\nPreliminary analyses of these emissions indeed indicate\nthat they are due to precipitating electrons of \u000110 keV\nenergy, with typical intensities of order tens of kR, very\ncomparable to the theoretical estimates made above.\nHowever, these observations also show that in addition\nto localized features such as the \u2018\u2018cusp spot\u2019\u2019 which clearly\ncannot be described by our simple axisymmetric model,\nsignificant structured emissions are also often present in the\nregion between these most poleward emissions and the main\noval. These have no direct counterpart in the present model,\nthus suggesting the possible presence of additional flow\nstructures that are not represented in our \u2018\u2018outer magneto-\nsphere\u2019\u2019 region and whose physical origins are at present\nunclear. We also note that the precipitating electron powers\nestimated here apply only to the accelerated electron compo-\nnent in discrete auroras associated with regions of upward\nfield-aligned current. In addition to this, widespread\n\u2018\u2018diffuse\u2019\u2019 electron precipitation will also generally be present\nin the closed field region, due to pitch-angle scattering of the\nhot trapped magnetospheric particle populations. Judging\nfrom the unaccelerated energy fluxes of the electron popula-\ntions in Table 1, however, only low-level energy fluxes and\nUVemissions are expected from this source.\n4. Jupiter Model With Variable Conductance\n[29] Ionospheric modeling results presented by Millward\net al. [2002] have shown that energetic electron precipita-\ntion into the Jovian ionosphere at the currents (electron\nnumber fluxes) envisaged here can significantly enhance the\nionospheric Pedersen conductance above the \u2018\u2018background\u2019\u2019\nTable 3.

The latter values assume that the whole of the current at the\nboundary is carried either by outer magnetosphere electrons or magnetosheath electrons in each case.\nA11209 COWLEY ET AL.: JOVIAN COUPLING CURRENTS\n11 of 18\nA11209\nlevels considered in section 2. Electronswith energy\u000160 keV\nwere found to be particularly effective, since they deposit\ntheir energy and create ionization directly within the Pedersen\nlayer. A beam of such electrons with a number flux equivalent\nto a field-aligned current of 1 mA m\u00022 was found to increase\nthe Pedersen conductance to \u00017.5 mho, a value much larger\nthan the value of 0.2mho employed in section 2. Conductance\n(or effective conductance) values are reduced, however, for\nlesser currents (as is generally the case in our solutions),\nhigher or lower electron energies, and by neutral atmosphere\ndrag. Nichols and Cowley [2004] self-consistently incorpo-\nrated precipitation feedback on conductance in their model of\nJupiter\u2019s middle magnetosphere, using a simple relation\nbetween field-aligned current and conductance based on\nMillward et al.\u2019s [2002] results. They found that signif-\nicant quantitative effects were produced relative to con-\nstant conductance models, with the upward field-aligned\ncurrent becoming concentrated in the inner part of the\nmiddle magnetosphere, mapping in the equatorial plane to\nradial distances \u000120 RJ. Such a concentration is in\nagreement with the experimental results of Khurana\n[2001] derived from Galileo magnetic field data. It is\ntherefore of interest to examine the effects of precipitation-\ninduced conductance variations in the present model. The\ncalculation is not fully self-consistent like that ofNichols and\nCowley [2004], however, since the plasma angular velocity\nprofile will be prescribed in the same way as in section 3\nabove, but the calculation can be applied to the whole polar\nionosphere rather than just to the middle magnetosphere\nregion. Insight can thus be gained on how the overall field-\naligned current structures will be modified when the\nconductance is locally enhanced within regions of upward\nfield-aligned current.\n[30] As indicated above, the conductance enhancements\nproduced by precipitation depend not only on the electron\ncurrent (number flux) but also on the electron energy. The\nelectron energy in turn depends on the magnetospheric\nsource population, which determines the acceleration volt-\nage through equation (15). Here we employ the same three\nsource populations as given in Table 2, corresponding to the\nmagnetosheath (open field lines), the outer magnetosphere,\nand the middle magnetosphere, and have determined how\nthe conductance depends on the field-aligned current for\neach of these sources using the same approach as that of\nNichols and Cowley [2004]. Briefly, for a given magneto-\nspheric source, the accelerating voltage and precipitating\nenergy flux are determined for a given current density by\nequations (15) and (17). As the accelerated electrons travel\ndown the field lines to the ionosphere, the distribution is\nassumed to be spread in energy about the characteristic\nenergy determined by the accelerating voltage, both to\nhigher and lower energies, though preserving the number\nflux and the energy flux. Using simple power-law assump-\ntions about the form of the distribution, the precipitating\nnumber flux in various electron energy bands are then\ncalculated and used to determine the contributions to the\nPedersen conductance from the results presented byMillward\net al. [2002] (see Nichols and Cowley [2004] for further\ndetails). These contributions are then summed to determine\nthe total enhancement of the Pedersen conductance from the\nfull precipitating accelerated (but spread) electron distribu-\ntion. This procedure is repeated for various precipitating\ncurrent densities to determine how the conductance en-\nhancement depends on the current for that magnetospheric\nsource population. The enhancement of the effective\nconductance is then taken to be just half this value,\nassuming k \u0007 0.5 in equation (4) on the basis of the\nresults of Millward et al. [2005]. Finally, we represent\nthese numerically generated models by a simple function\nof the current density which has the same form (but\ndiffering coefficients) for each source population. Specif-\nically, conductance dependence on the current has been\ntaken to have the form\nSP* jki\n\b \t \u00bc SP0* \u00fe DSP* 12 1\u00fe tanh jki \u0002 jki\n*\nDjki*\n ! !\" #\n\u000b 1\n2\n1\u00fe tanh\njki \u0002 j0ki\nDj0ki\n ! !\" #\n; \u00f022\u00de\nwhere SP0* = 0.2 mho is the constant background\nconductance, as employed in sections 2 and 3, and the\nsecond term describes the electron source-dependent\nenhancement due to precipitation. For the middle magneto-\nsphere we employ DSP* = 1.25 mho, j*ki = 0.24 mAm\n\u00022,\nand Dj*ki = 0.17 mAm\n\u00022, for the outer magnetosphere DSP* =\n0.6 mho, j*ki = 0.4 mAm\n\u00022, and Dj*ki = 0.25 mAm\n\u00022, while\nfor the magnetosheath we take DSP* = 0.0275 mho, j*ki =\n0.4 mAm\u00022, and Dj*ki = 0.45 mAm\n\u00022. We also take jki\n0 = Djki\n0 =\n0.05 mAm\u00022 in the final term in equation (22), which is used\nto ensure that the model conductance enhancement reduces\nrapidly to small values for downward (negative) field-\naligned currents. With these values, the variation of the\neffective Pedersen conductance with field-aligned current\nfor each of the three source populations is shown in Figure 5,\nfor currents up to 0.6 mA m\u00022 (the approximate limit of\nvalidity of the above formulas). The solid line shows the\nFigure 5. Model variations of the effective height-\nintegrated ionospheric Pedersen conductance on field-\naligned current density for the three magnetospheric source\npopulations employed, whose parameters are given in\nTable 2. These are based on equation (22), with parameter\nvalues given in the text. The solid line is for the middle\nmagnetosphere, the dot-dashed line for the outer magneto-\nsphere, and the dashed line for the magnetosheath source on\nopen field lines. The lowest dotted line shows the constant\nbackground conductance of 0.2mho towhich these curves are\nasymptotic for negative (downward) currents.\nA11209 COWLEY ET AL.: JOVIAN COUPLING CURRENTS\n12 of 18\nA11209\nvariation for the middle magnetosphere source, the dot-\ndashed line for the outer magnetosphere source, and the\ndashed line for the magnetosheath source. The lowest dotted\nline shows the background conductance of 0.2 mho to which\nthese models are asymptotic for negative field-aligned\ncurrent. It can be seen that for the current densities of\ninterest here, up to several tenths of a mA m\u00022, the increases\nin the conductance for the low-density relatively energetic\nmiddle magnetosphere source are very high (more than a\nfactor of \u00015), are more modest for the cooler outer\nmagnetosphere source (factors of \u00012\u20133), and are essentially\nnegligible for the cold dense magnetosheath source.\n[31] For purposes of numerical calculation, equation (22)\nhas been applied with coefficients DSP*, j*ki, and Dj*ki varying\ncontinuously with latitude between the values quoted above.\nThat is, using a hyperbolic tangent function of colatitude,\nwe have switched continuously from magnetosheath\ncoefficients to outer magnetosphere coefficients in a narrow\nregion about the open-closed field line boundary, and from\nouter magnetosphere to middle magnetosphere coefficients\nin the interface between the latter regions. Specifically, the\nwidth of the transition region at the open-closed field line\nboundary in the results to be presented below is taken to be\n\u00010.05\u0001, small compared with the width of the current sheet\nat that boundary of \u00010.25\u0001, while the transition between the\nouter and middle magnetosphere is centered at 14\u0001, and is\ntaken to be \u00011\u0001 wide. With these transitions in coefficients,\nthen, the effective Pedersen conductance becomes an\nexplicit continuous function of jki and qi. Substitution of\nequations (3) and (5) into (6), and retaining the conductance\nwithin the differential, then yields the following nonlinear\nfirst-order equation for jki\nBiWJ\nd\ndqi\nsin2 qi 1\u0002 w qi\u00f0 \u00deWJ\n\u0001 \u0002\nSP* jki; qi\n\b \t\u0005 \u0007\n\u00fe sin qi jki \u00bc 0; \u00f023\u00de\nwhere (w(qi)\/WJ) is given by equation (21). This equation is\nsolved numerically with the use of one boundary condition.\nHere we have started the solution close to the pole qi = 0\u0001\nwith a (negative) current density equal to that of the\nconstant conductance solution, though the solutions else-\nwhere are not sensitive to this choice. Having found the\nfield-aligned current from the solution of equation (23), and\nhence the conductance profile, the ionospheric currents\nfollow from equations (3) and (5), the energy transfers from\nequations (8) and (9), and the auroral parameters from\nequations (15)\u2013(17). In Figures 6\u20138 we show results\nspecifically for the Jovian \u2018\u2018high\u2019\u2019 angular velocity model of\nsection 3 (see Figure 1a), where the solid lines show results\nfor the variable conductance calculation, while the dashed\nlines show the constant conductance (0.2 mho) solution\nof section 3 for easy comparison. The plots follow the\nformat of Figures 2\u20134, except that in Figure 7 we also\ninclude a plot of the variation of the ionospheric Pedersen\nconductance with latitude. In the auroral parameter plots\nin Figure 8 we also only show values derived using\nmagnetosheath source parameters poleward of the bound-\nary of open field lines, and only values derived using outer\nmagnetosphere source parameters equatorward of the\nboundary, in conformity with the assumptions made above\nconcerning the behavior of the conductance model. Results\nfor the \u2018\u2018low\u2019\u2019 angular velocity model show related\nfeatures and will not be shown here.\n[32] First, it can be seen that the overall nature of the\nsolutions is similar to that of the constant conductance\nsolution, being significantly modified only in the layers of\nupward field-aligned current at the boundary of open field\nlines and in the middle magnetosphere region. If we first\nconsider the boundary of open field lines near qi \u0001 10\u0001, it\ncan be seen in Figure 7c that the ionospheric conductance\nbecomes modestly enhanced by precipitation on the equa-\ntorward side of the boundary where outer magnetospheric\nelectrons are assumed to carry the current, and that this has\nthe effect of enhancing and maintaining the Pedersen\ncurrent as the angular velocity increases nearer to rigid\ncorotation. Consequently, the Pedersen current falls less\nFigure 6.

The total current flowing up\nthe field lines in the boundary region is also modestly\nreduced by this effect (Figure 7a), from \u000112 to \u00019 MA.\nA further consequence for the auroral parameters is that the\naccelerating voltages are also reduced due to the reduced\ncurrent densities, though they are spread over a wider\nregion. However, since the energy flux goes as the square\nof the current density (equation (17)), the total precipitating\nelectron power is overall reduced. It can be seen in Figure 8a\nthat the peak accelerating voltage on the equatorward\nside of the boundary is reduced from \u000115 to \u00014 kV, such\nthat the peak energy flux is strongly reduced from \u000110 to\n\u00010.75 mW m\u00022 (Figure 8c). The latter corresponds to a\nrelatively weak UV auroral emission of \u00017.5 kR, compared\nwith a \u0001100 kR peak for the constant conductance model.\nOverall, integrating over only closed field lines equatorward\nof the boundary, the total power of precipitating accelerated\nouter magnetospheric electrons in the vicinity of the bound-\nary is found to be \u000124 GW (per hemisphere), compared\nwith \u000174 GW for the constant conductance model (this\nvalue being about half that given in Table 3 where the\nFigure 7.

The dashed lines show the\nconstant conductance (0.2 mho) solutions, as in Figure 4.\nUnlike Figure 4, however, values using magnetosheath\nsource parameters are shown (by solid and dashed lines)\nonly on the poleward side of the open field boundary, while\nvalues using outer magnetosphere parameters are shown\n(also by solid and dashed lines) only on the equatorward\nside of the open field boundary, in conformity with the\nassumptions made in constructing the conductance variation\nmodel.\nA11209 COWLEY ET AL.: JOVIAN COUPLING CURRENTS\n14 of 18\nA11209\nintegral was applied to the whole of the upward current\nregion). The effect of the conductance enhancement at the\nopen field boundary is thus to spread (and somewhat\nreduce) the upward current and hence to reduce both the\nenergy flux and total power of the precipitating accelerated\nouter magnetosphere electrons. The power of the precipi-\ntating accelerated magnetosheath electrons poleward of the\nboundary is also sharply reduced from \u00011.3 to \u00010.2 GW,\nbut this is relatively small in either case.\n[33] Turning now to the middle magnetosphere region at\nthe equatorward boundary of the subcorotating plasma, the\neffect of the conductance enhancement in the region of\nupward field-aligned current is basically similar to that at\nthe open field boundary, but its consequences for auroral\neffects are different. That is, as the angular velocity starts to\nincrease toward rigid corotation in the poleward region of\nthe layer, the conductance starts to rise rapidly (Figure 7c),\nthus tending to maintain the Pedersen current in the layer\n(Figures 6a and 7a). However, in this case, the rise of\nthe plasma angular velocity continues inexorably, such\nthat the Pedersen current does then fall as the angular\nvelocity approaches rigid corotation. The overall effect is\nthus to concentrate the upward field-aligned current in a\nlayer on the equatorward side of the middle magneto-\nsphere region, where the field-aligned current densities\nare enhanced compared with the constant conductance\nsolution (Figure 7b). The auroral parameters are also conse-\nquently concentrated and enhanced on the equatorward side\nof the middle magnetosphere region (Figure 8), with peak\nenergy fluxes doubling from \u000120 to \u000140 mW m\u00022. The\noverall power per hemisphere of precipitating accelerated\nelectrons is also somewhat increased, from \u00011.6 TW\n(as given in Table 3) to \u00011.9 TW.\n[34] Overall, the effect of the conductance enhancements\nin regions of upward field-aligned current is to spread the\ncurrent on the equatorward side of the open field line\nboundary, thus spreading and reducing the auroral precip-\nitation, while concentrating the current in the equatorward\npart of the middle magnetosphere region, thus concentrating\nand enhancing the auroral precipitation in this region. The\nlatter effect therefore mirrors the current concentration\neffect into the inner part of the middle magnetosphere in\nthe self-consistent calculations presented by Nichols and\nCowley [2004]. The effect on the planetary rotation powers\ntransferred to atmospheric heating and the magnetosphere\nare shown in Figures 6b and 6c, respectively. The enhance-\nments of the Pedersen current in regions of upward field-\naligned current on closed field lines marginally increases\nthe atmospheric heating effect (Figure 6b), while more\nstrongly enhancing the energy transfer to the magnetosphere\n(Figure 6c) in those regions. Integrating over the whole\npolar ionosphere, the power dissipated per hemisphere to\natmospheric heating is marginally increased from \u0001440 TW\nin the constant conductance solution (see Table 1) to\n\u0001460 TW in the variable conductance model. The power\ntransferred to the magnetosphere, however, is more signif-\nicantly increased from \u0001290 to \u0001350 TW per hemisphere.\n5. Summary\n[35] In this paper we have developed a simple axisym-\nmetric model of the flow and currents in Jupiter\u2019s polar\nionosphere. This is of a similar nature to the Saturn model\npresented previously by Cowley et al. [2004b], in which the\nplasma angular velocity is specified at the outset using a\ncombination of observations, previous modeling, and theory,\nfrom which the currents and related auroral parameters are\nthen calculated. The plasma angular velocity model incor-\nporates a simple description of four regions mapping to the\ninner, middle, and outer magnetosphere regions on closed\nfield lines, and the open field region mapping to the tail. In\nthis context the inner magnetosphere is the region where the\nplasma near-rigidly corotates with the planet, extending to\n\u000120 RJ in the equatorial plane. The plasma angular velocity\nthen falls to some fraction of rigid corotation across the\nmiddle magnetosphere, before plateauing at that value in\nthe outer magnetosphere. The fraction concerned is taken to\nbe either a quarter or a half of rigid corotation in the results\ndisplayed, the former value corresponding possibly to a\nmore expanded magnetosphere with lower angular veloci-\nties on closed field lines and the latter corresponding to a\nmore compressed magnetosphere with higher angular ve-\nlocities. The open field region is similarly taken to be a\nregion where the flow is strongly subcorotational (\u000110%\nof rigid corotation). We have then computed the field-\nperpendicular and field-aligned current systems implied by\nthe angular velocity model, first assuming a constant value\nof the effective height-integrated ionospheric Pedersen\nconductance of 0.2 mho, this value being found to provide\noverall currents in agreement with observations. From\nthese results we have then been able to discuss three\nprincipal issues, concerning overall closure of the current\nsystem, the power dissipated to heat in the upper atmosphere\nand transferred to the magnetosphere, and expectations on\nauroral emissions associated with electron acceleration\nabove regions of upward field-aligned current.\n[36] On the first of these topics, we find in common with\nprevious analyses that the field-aligned current is directed\nuniformly upward out of the ionosphere in the middle\nmagnetosphere region where the angular velocity falls with\nincreasing latitude. These currents total \u000135 and \u000150 MA\nper hemisphere in the two plasma angular velocity models\nevaluated here. As shown by the dashed lines in Figure 9,\nthese currents then flow radially outward across the field in\nthe equatorial middle magnetosphere, imparting planetary\nrotational energy and angular momentum to the outwardly\ndiffusing plasma. Part of the current (roughly half in these\nmodels) then flows down the field lines again in the outer\nmagnetosphere (certainly on the dayside), while part also\nflows out to the magnetopause. There it is joined by the\nsmaller upward current (several MA) from the open field\nboundary region and then flows along the magnetopause to\nthe tail. These tailward directed currents then close through\nthe central region of the twisted tail lobe back to the polar\nionosphere to complete the current circuit.\n[37] With regard to energy transfers, we find that the total\npower dissipated from planetary rotation to upper atmo-\nspheric heating via the current system is several hundred\nTW per hemisphere (\u0001400 and \u0001700 TW per hemisphere\nin our two models). This compares with a globally averaged\nsolar EUV input to the upper atmosphere of \u00011 TW. It thus\nseems reasonable to suppose that these powers provide an\nimportant contribution to resolving the issue of the unex-\npectedly high temperatures found in the Jovian thermo-\nA11209 COWLEY ET AL.: JOVIAN COUPLING CURRENTS\n15 of 18\nA11209\nsphere, though the issue remains open of how this power\ncan be globally redistributed from the polar region where it\nis deposited. The power transferred to the magnetosphere by\nthe current system is found to be \u0001300 TW in the two\nmodels, most of which occurs on closed field lines.\n[38] On the topic of discrete auroras produced by field-\naligned accelerated electrons, we noted above that the\nmodel contains two rings of upward field-aligned current,\none occurring at the boundary of open field lines, the other\nat the equatorward boundary of the region of subcorotating\nflow mapping to the middle magnetosphere. The field-\naligned current densities in the model are comparable in\nthese two regions, peaking at a few tenths of a mA m\u00022\n(compared with \u00010.05 mA m\u00022 in the downward current\nregions in the outer magnetosphere and open field region),\nresulting from the fact that though the total current carried in\nthe middle magnetosphere is significantly larger than at the\nopen field boundary, it is also significantly wider in latitude.\nThese upward current densities require field-aligned accel-\neration of magnetospheric electrons in all cases, whether\ncarried by magnetosheath or outer magnetosphere electrons\nat the open field boundary or by hot tenuous electrons in the\nmiddle magnetosphere. Discrete auroras are thus expected\nin both regions, though being dominated in terms of total\nprecipitating electron power by the middle magnetosphere.\nThe total power deposited by precipitating accelerated\n\u000150\u2013100 keV electrons in the middle magnetosphere\nregion is found to be \u00012\u20134 TW per hemisphere, the higher\nvalue corresponding to the lower angular velocity model\npossibly representing a more expanded magnetosphere.\nThese values are comparable to the electron input powers\ndeduced from auroral observations, and are at least two\norders of magnitude less than the \u2018\u2018Joule heating\u2019\u2019 values\nquoted above. The total power deposited by \u00015\u201310 keV\nelectrons in the open field boundary region (\u000110\u2013150 GW)\nis then estimated to be one to two orders of magnitude less\nthan for the middle magnetosphere, with the higher value\nnow corresponding to the higher angular velocity model\npossibly representing a more compressed magnetosphere.\nThese values are somewhat smaller than the \u0001500 GW\ndeduced from auroral observations poleward of the main\noval, such that our model provides only a partial explana-\ntion of these emissions. These precipitating discrete auroral\nelectron powers do not include, of course, the possibility of\nfurther significant electron energy input to the atmosphere\nfrom broadly distributed \u2018\u2018diffuse\u2019\u2019 electron precipitation,\ndue to electron pitch-angle scattering from the trapped hot\npopulations on closed field lines.\n[39] It is of interest briefly to compare these results with\nthose obtained from the related Saturn model described\npreviously by Cowley et al. [2004b]. In this case the radial\ndistance of the ionosphere is similar to Jupiter, as are the\nplanetary and plasma angular velocities. However, the iono-\nspheric magnetic field strength is a factor of \u000120 smaller at\nSaturn, while the estimated effective Pedersen conductivity\nis \u00015 times larger. These factors then combine to produce\nionospheric currents which are overall a factor of \u00015 times\nsmaller at Saturn than at Jupiter, while the powers trans-\nferred to upper atmospheric heating and to the magneto-\nsphere are around two orders of magnitude less (\u00014 and\n\u00018 TW, respectively). The Saturn model also produces two\nrings of upward field-aligned current, one associated with\nthe open-closed field line boundary and the other with the\nmiddle magnetosphere, as in the Jupiter model presented\nhere. In the Saturn model, however, the current densities are\nvery asymmetrical, with the current density in the ring at the\nopen field boundary being comparable to that in our Jupiter\nmodel, a few tenths of a mA m\u00022, while that mapping to the\nmiddle magnetosphere is much less, \u000110 nA m\u00022, due to\nthe broad region of the ionosphere to which it maps.\nConsequently, field-aligned acceleration of magnetospheric\nelectrons is required only at the open field boundary in this\ncase, and not in the middle magnetosphere, such that\ndiscrete auroras will be dominated by the solar wind\ninteraction. Again, this does not preclude the possibility\nof additional broadly distributed diffuse electron precipita-\ntion from hot trapped magnetospheric electrons on closed\nfield lines.\n[40] Finally, we have also presented a development of the\nJupiter model in which precipitation-induced modification\nof the ionospheric conductance is included in the current\ncontinuity description, based on the modeling results of\nMillward et al. [2002]. We have shown that this has the\neffect of spreading the upward field-aligned current on\nclosed field lines at the open field boundary, thereby\nreducing both the energy flux and the total power of\nprecipitating accelerated outer magnetosphere electrons. In\nthe middle magnetosphere, however, it has the effect of\nconcentrating the upward field-aligned current in the equa-\ntorward region of the middle magnetosphere (in agreement\nwith the effect found previously by Nichols and Cowley\n[2004]), thus somewhat increasing both the electron energy\nflux in this region and the total precipitating electron power.\n[41] Acknowledgments.
