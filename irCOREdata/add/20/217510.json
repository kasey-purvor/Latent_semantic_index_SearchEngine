We evaluate \nopportunities and challenges facing the development of a more interactive research \nenvironment by developing an interdisciplinary synthesis of research on a single \ngeographic region. We focus on the Amazon as a region of global environmental \nimportance, and one that faces a highly uncertain future. To take stock of existing \nknowledge and provide a framework for analysis we present a set of mini reviews \nfrom twelve different areas of research, encompassing taxonomy, biodiversity, \nbiogeography, vegetation dynamics, landscape ecology, earth-atmosphere \ninteractions, ecosystem processes, fire, deforestation dynamics, hydrology, hunting, \nconservation planning, livelihoods and payments for ecosystem services. Each review \nhighlights the current state of our knowledge and identifies research priorities, \nincluding major challenges and opportunities. We show that while substantial \nprogress is being made across many areas of scientific research, our understanding of \nspecific issues is often dependent on knowledge from other disciplines. Accelerating \nthe acquisition of reliable and contextualized knowledge about the fate of complex \nhuman-modified ecosystems depends partly on our ability to exploit economies of \nscale in shared resources and technical expertise, recognise and make explicit \ninterconnections and feedbacks among sub-disciplines, increase the temporal and \nspatial scale of existing studies, and improve the dissemination of scientific findings \nto policy makers and society at large. There is enormous scope for improved \ninteraction within the wider research community. Enhanced communication provides \nan essential foundation for more in-depth coordination of research effort and \ncollaboration between researchers. Enhancing interaction between research efforts is \nvital if we are to make the most of limited funds and overcome the challenges posed \nby addressing large-scale interdisciplinary questions that underpin the future of our \n 3 \nplanet. Bringing together a diverse scientific community with a single geographic \nfocus can help increase awareness of research questions both within and among \ndisciplines, and reveal the opportunities that may exist for advancing acquisition of \nreliable knowledge. This approach can be useful for a variety of globally important \nscientific questions. \n \nKeywords: learning networks, interdisciplinary research, Brazil, Venezuela, Peru, \nColombia, Bolivia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Surinam  \n \n \n 4 \nIntroduction \n \nThe global research community is incredibly prolific, but the enormous and \nexpanding volume of information that has been accumulated presents a significant \nchallenge to scientists attempting to keep up with the latest developments, and to \nthose responsible for developing science-based policy recommendations. In many \ncases researchers are simply unaware of the research that is being conducted in either \ntheir own or parallel disciplines, or are too focused or busy to make the connections. \nMoreover, traditional reward systems in academia can favour practices that result in a \nnarrow and more assured set of outcomes (e.g. low-risk, single-disciplinary research \nproducts) that limit the range and scale of scientific pursuits and the scope of \ninterdisciplinary collaboration (Uriarte et al. 2007). This isolation and fragmentation \nprocess can drive a positive feedback: the more fragmented academic research \nbecomes, the more challenging it is to synthesise for newcomers to a field, and the \ngreater the risk that it becomes increasingly inaccessible or inappropriate for potential \nend-users.  This can lead to parallel research initiatives being conducted within the \nsame geographic region, and a lack of clear incentives for researchers to interact or \nlearn from one another (Salafsky and Margoluis, 1999). \n \nA more interactive research environment may be stimulated through the development \nof learning or research networks (Salafsky & Margoluis 1999; Brown & Salafsky \n2004), which could prevent the fragmentation of science and increase the \neffectiveness of research. A learning network (also termed portfolio) is a varyingly \nformalized structure for facilitating collaborative learning and action (Brown & \nSalafsky 2004), and ensures that the latest ideas, practical and technical experience \nand research findings can be readily exchanged and benefited from. Within a \nscientific context, the delivery of robust and socially-relevant knowledge would be \nenhanced if research communities with diverse skills and interests are: (1) able to \nshare new information and knowledge efficiently and rapidly, (2) aware of the major \nscientific challenges that characterize both their own and other disciplines, and (3) \nable to draw on this knowledge and awareness to exploit economies of scale in \n 5 \nresources and expertise, as well as contribute towards interdisciplinary research \nchallenges. \n \nHere, we present findings from a symposium held in London in 2008 which forms an \ninitial stage in the development of a learning network for a group of researchers based \nwithin one nation (the United Kingdom) who have a common interest in a single \ngeographic region (the Amazon). We chose this focus because the Amazon: (1) is of \nenormous global importance, (2) faces a highly uncertain future, threatened by both \ndevelopment pressures and climate change (Lenton et al., 2008; Malhi et al., 2008, \nPhillips et al. 2009), and (3) is large and complex, so that effective and sustainable \nmanagement depends upon the success of efficient and collaborative research efforts.  \nMoreover, by focusing on a relatively small research community such as that based in \nthe UK, it was comparatively easy to bring together representatives from disparate \ndisciplines. An obvious next step would be to expand this by including the many \nAmazon researchers based outside the UK. However, the UK-based research \ncommunity provides an excellent test-case for this exercise as they target similar \nfunding sources, are likely to share similar challenges, and there are few logistical \nbarriers to prevent interaction and communication among participants. \n \nThe 14 mini-reviews presented in this paper cover a variety of scientific disciplines, \nranging from climatology and ecology to economics and social science. Each review \nhighlights the current state of our knowledge, and then briefly identifies key gaps in \nunderstanding and major research challenges. While our coverage of individual \ndisciplines is necessarily concise, the value of this exercise lies in the juxtaposition of \ninformation from a diverse array of scientific disciplines within a single forum, \nallowing an up-to-date appraisal of current understanding and inter-connections \nwithin and among disciplines. In the discussion we draw on the groundwork provided \nby these syntheses to examine potentially rewarding opportunities and mechanisms to \nfacilitate collaborative investigation. This paper and analysis is a first and important \nstep in the development of a more sustainable and interactive research and learning \nenvironment.  \n \nState of existing knowledge and research challenges in Amazonian research \n 6 \n1) Climate and Earth-Atmosphere interactions   \nTemperature has increased by ~0.25\u00baC per decade over the Amazon basin over the \nlast 30 years, CO2 has risen by approximately 35% compared to pre-industrial times \nand surface solar radiation has varied (Leuenberger et al., 1992, Wild et al., 2005).  In \ncontrast there is no significant trend in precipitation (Malhi and Wright, 2004), \nalthough there were widespread droughts in 1998 and 2005. \n \nCorrelative evidence suggests soil water balance and its seasonality to be a main \ncontrol of vegetation type (Woodward, 1987, Malhi et al., in press). Vegetation \ndistribution and extent may also potentially be affected by temperature induced \nchanges in plant functioning as well as by changes in atmospheric CO2 (Lloyd and \nFarquhar, 2008) and radiation.  \n \nThere are important vegetation-climate feedbacks, with water isotope data revealing \nthat approximately 50 % of water is recirculated to the atmosphere through Amazon \nforest canopies (Salati and Vose, 1984; Shukla et al., 1990). In 2000 Cox et al. (2000) \npublished results from the first fully coupled climate land vegetation model and \npredicted Amazonian rainforests to convert to savanna. However the Hadley Centre \nmodel underlying these results heavily underestimates today\u2019s Amazon precipitation. \nMalhi et al. (in press) used a heuristic approach to correct for the model precipitation \nbiases, and came to much more modest conclusions with some of the rainforests being \nreplaced by seasonal forests in their analysis but not savannah-type climate \nconditions. The Hadley model results are also not entirely consistent with basin-wide \nmulti-decadal trends of aboveground biomass increase across a dense forest plot \ncensus network (Phillips et al., 1998). \n \nThe current main limitations on future Amazon vegetation predictions include a \nsimplistic representation of vegetation dynamics, insufficient model resolution (Malhi \net al. in press), poor cloud physics representation (Parker personal communication) \nand uncertainties in the prediction of large-scale warming patterns of tropical Pacific \nand Atlantic (Held et al. 2005).  \n2) Deforestation dynamics & land use change      \nComment [j1]: Liana Anderson: What \nabout: Li, W., R.

I \nthink it is just a wording issue. \nComment [j3]: check \nComment [j4]: check \n 7 \nThe Amazon Basin is the most active frontier of land cover change in the world.  \nHistorically, government-sponsored colonisation schemes initiated widespread \ndeforestation in the Amazon as nations rushed to secure ownership of their territory \n(Rudel, 2005).  Although there is significant intra-regional variability in the drivers of \nland-use change, the majority of deforestation is currently driven by: (1) the \nexpansion of extensive cattle ranching and industrial-scale agriculture for an \nincreasingly global food market, and the associated development of infrastructure \n(Pan et al., 2004; Armenteras et al., 2006; Morton et al., 2006); (2) the small clearings \nof subsistence farmers migrating to new forest frontiers (Etter et al., 2006); and (3) \nlogging which can act as a precursor to outright deforestation (e.g. Asner et al., 2006).  \nThe location of most deforestation is determined by the construction of new and \npaving of existing roads, combined with a lack of strong governance (Soares-Filho et \nal., 2004; Fearnside and de Alencastro, 2006).  Protected areas, sustainable use \nreserves and indigenous lands set spatial limits to deforestation and perform an \neffective job at slowing the spread of deforestation across the Basin (Nepstad et al., \n2006; Oliveira et al., 2007). \n \nDeveloping better predictive models of deforestation will require: (1) understanding \nthe drivers of deforestation and subsequent land cover change at appropriate spatial \nscales, and (2) predicting the patterns of future road networks based on social and \neconomic drivers.  Detecting deforestation and the drivers for deforestation in such a \ndiverse region is challenging, although some methodologies have been successfully \ntested for areas with large scale deforestation patterns (Anderson et al., 2005, Morton \net al., 2006). Attempts to predict road expansion have improved in recent years \n(Arima et al., 2008) although these are yet to be validated and have suffered from a \nlack of data on unofficial road networks (Brand\u00e3o Jr and Souza Jr, 2006).   \n3) Amazonian wildfires      \nForest degradation (logging, fragmentation) and severe droughts combine to increase \nthe frequency of fire in Amazonian forests, which acts as a powerful agent of tropical \nforest degradation. Low-intensity fires often lead to very high levels of tree mortality \n(up to 50% of trees \u226510cm diameter) and a significant loss of faunal diversity \n(including disturbance sensitive forest vertebrates) (Barlow and Peres, 2004). Fires \n 8 \ncan also lead to ecosystem instability and destabilising feedback cycles, as forests that \nhave burned once are more likely to burn again, with much greater effects on \nvegetation and biodiversity (Cochrane et al., 1999; but see Balch et al., 2008 from \nexperimental burns). Recent research has demonstrated the critical role of rare \ndrought events led by ENSO events and Atlantic SST changes, which increase fire \noccurrence when combined with fire-dependent human activities (Arag\u00e3o et al., 2007; \n2008). Fire is considered to be one of the key processes through which a climate-\nmediated forest dieback could occur (Barlow and Peres, 2008; Malhi et al., 2009).  \n \nWe still have a relatively poor understanding of the spatial and temporal variation in \nthe causes and consequences of fire, and how fires interact with other forms of forest \ndegradation and across different spatial scales. This information is vital to be able to \nbetter predict the local and global implications of fires, identify vulnerability, and \ndefine and highlight potential tipping points where humid tropical forests may no \nlonger recover. Although some attempts have been made to quantify fire-mediated \nchanges in vegetation cover (e.g. Thonicke et al., 2001; Bond et al., 2005) and carbon \nemissions (DeFries et al., 2008), we are still unable to accurately predict long-term \nchanges in vegetation and carbon dynamics in fire-disturbed forests. Key areas of \nuncertainty include tree mortality, biodiversity loss, forest regeneration, the above- \nand below-ground carbon budget, feedback cycles, and the socio-economic context of \nfire use and management. Remote sensing plays a critical role in any scaling up \nexercises, and accuracy would be vastly improved through a multi-temporal analysis \nof fire scars that takes into account fire intensity, land-cover, and the type of fire. \n \n4) Water resources and hydrology  \nRecent modelling estimates the discharge of the Amazon as 280,000 m3 per second,, \nwhile other estimates are lower at 200,000 to 220,000 m3 per second (Korzun, 1978; \nRichey et al., 1989), representing some 15-16% of all freshwater delivered to the \noceans globally.  The river carries less sediment than other comparable rivers, most of \nwhich (80-90%) derives from the Andean parts of the basin (Goulding et al., 2003). \nAt least five large dams exist within the basin with a further nine proposed. \n 9 \nForest cover is widely assumed to facilitate the maintenance of high rainfall, flood \ncontrol, dry season and environmental flows and water quality (Kaimowitz, 2004).  \nLoss of forest cover over large spatial scales is considered by many to decrease \nrainfall, though studies have shown rainfall to decrease in some areas and increase in \nothers and the impacts to be rather small (Kaimowitz, 2004; ESPA-AA, 2008).  \nForests are also expected to reduce flooding frequency though most detailed studies \nfind no such relationship and for the largest and most destructive events forests are \nlikely to have little impact (Bradshaw et al. 2007).  The picture is less clear for the \nmaintenance of dry season flows, where the outcome depends on the balance between \nevaporation-induced flow loss under forests and enhanced baseflows through \nincreased infiltration.  There is also an important distinction to be made between \nlowland and tropical montane cloud forests in this regard (Bruijnzeel, 2004). \nThough a wealth of hydrological and hydro-climatic studies have been carried out at \nthe plot scale in the Amazon (e.g. the Large-scale Biosphere Atmosphere programme \nLBA), much less effort has been given to sub-basin and basin scale hydrological \nremote sensing and modelling.  This is critical to understand the basin-wide response \nto land use and climate change.  Early basin-wide studies indicate that the \nhydrological impact of climate change may be much greater than that of land use \nchange (ESPA-AA, 2008).  Similarly there is a dearth of long term monitoring \nsufficient to capture important variability, including droughts and extreme events.  \nStudies so far have tended to focus on how hydrological processes respond to large \nscale clear-cut whereas much land use change is less dramatic and the hydrological \nresponse is likely to be conditioned by the nature and growth dynamics of the \nreplacement cover.   \n5) Ecosystem processes         \nYadvinder Malhi \n6) Vegetation dynamics          \nRecent comparative studies have revealed that patterns of carbon storage and \ndynamics vary strongly between different upland forests in Amazonia, overturning \nprevious ideas that different tropical forests function in broadly similar ways. Western \nComment [T5]: TAG: Check ref: \nBradshaw et al\u2019s main conclusion is that \ndeforestation leads to more flooding  \n 10 \nAmazon upland forests have much higher rates of aboveground productivity (Malhi et \nal., 2004), and tree turnover (Phillips et al., 2004) but lower aboveground biomass \n(Baker et al., 2004b) than forests in central and eastern Amazonia. Edaphic factors, \nrather than climate, determine these patterns and both soil chemical properties, \nparticularly phosphorous concentrations, and physical properties, such as soil depth, \nhave important roles (Quesada et al., 2009 ). In addition, variation in species \ncomposition modifies how variation in soil conditions affects certain ecosystem \nproperties such as stand-level biomass estimates (Baker et al., 2004b) and mortality \nrates (Chao et al., 2008). \n \nThe rate of tree recruitment, mortality and biomass has increased widely in \nAmazonian forests in recent decades (Baker et al., 2004a; Lewis et al., 2004; Phillips \net al., 2004) probably as a result of global environmental change (Phillips et al., \n2008). Understanding the underlying spatial variation in forest dynamics has been \nimportant for interpreting these changes: increases in tree turnover and biomass have \nbeen largest where tree turnover rates and productivity were already high, in western \nAmazonia (Baker et al., 2004a; Lewis et al., 2004). \n \nUnderstanding the context of individual sites and regions will remain important for \ninterpreting change in Amazonian forests. Such shifts may be driven by the observed \nincrease in tree turnover rates or increased drought frequency, predicted by some \nmodels of future climate. For example, a change to a system where patterns of forest \ndynamics are more strongly constrained by water availability would cause abrupt \nincreases in drought-related tree mortality (Nepstad et al., 2007; Phillips et al., 2009), \ndecreased tree growth rates (Baker et al., 2003) and could alter the distribution of \ndifferent forest types over longer timescales (Malhi et al., in press). However, the \nmany drivers of change and significant heterogeneity of the Amazonian forest make \nthe exact nature of ecological responses difficult to predict. Long-term monitoring in \nmultiple sites, studies of the short- and long-term impacts of disturbance and drought, \nand close coupling of field data and modelling efforts are the key priorities for \nunderstanding the future vegetation dynamics of intact Amazonian forests. \n7) Landscape ecology  \nComment [T6]: Check potential \ncontradiction with section 1. \nComment [RME7]: Check \n \n 11 \nLandscape ecology in the Amazon has been dominated by the long-running \nBiological Dynamics of Forest Fragmentation Project (BDFFP; Laurance et al., \n2002).  The long-term study of a single site has allowed the detection of many \ntemporal effects of forest fragmentation that have rarely been described, such as the \nprogression from crowding effects in birds immediately post-fragmentation (Stouffer \nand Bierregaard, 1995) to local extinction events in small remnants (Ferraz et al., \n2003). Time series data from the BDFFP has also allowed the quantification of \nfragmentation-induced changes to ecological processes such as tree mortality and \nrecruitment rates (Laurance et al., 2006), leading to a better understanding of the \ntemporal development of edge effects and the drivers of spatio-temporal variability in \nfragmented landscapes (Laurance et al., 2007). \n \nThe uneven spatial distribution of landscape ecology research and the strong focus on \nthe BDFFP landscape necessarily means that our understanding of the context-\ndependence of landscape patterns and species dynamics is very limited (Gardner et \nal., 2009).  Consequently, there is only a limited understanding of the cumulative and \nsynergistic effects of multiple disturbances that are known to exacerbate \nfragmentation impacts in heavily settled parts of the Amazon (Peres, 2001; Peres and \nMichalski, 2006). \n \nLandscape ecology in the Amazon suffers shortcomings that are common to \nlandscape ecology in general. Although the biological integrity of forest fragments is \nheavily dependent on the structural characteristics of the habitat matrix surrounding \nthose fragments (Nascimento et al., 2006; Stouffer et al., 2009), there is a persistent \nreluctance to collect biological data in that matrix despite the overwhelming \nimportance of understanding species\u2019 abilities to tolerate, disperse through, or survive \nin the modified habitats that replace old growth forest.  Recent studies have begun to \naddress these questions by sampling multiple taxa in multiple habitat types (e.g. \nBarlow et al., 2007). A second and related issue is that carefully designed studies with \nmultiple landscapes are completely absent, yet the biophysical, socio-economic and \nhistorical context of landscapes can exert a strong influence on biodiversity \npersistence (Gardner et al., 2009). \n8) Sampling biodiversity \n 12 \nThe Amazon basin is one of the world\u2019s most species-rich biomes and contains some \nof the highest known levels of biological diversity including >50,000 terrestrial \nvascular plant species (e.g. Hubbell et al. 2008) and with some single localities of SW \nAmazonia sustaining the highest levels of alpha-diversity ever documented on Earth, \nincluding woody plans (Gentry 1998), butterflies (Emmel and Austin 1990), lizards \n(Dixon and Soini 1986) and nonvolant mammals (Peres 1999). Yet the distribution of \nAmazonian forest biodiversity is highly heterogeneous (Pitman et al, 2008), \nparticularly when comparing between seasonally flooded and unflooded forests (e.g. \nsmall mammals; Malcolm et al. 2005, and large forest vertebrates; Haugaasen & Peres \n2005). \nBecause of its vast size, poor infrastructure and lack of research investment, our \nunderstanding of Amazonian biodiversity remains very poor with most species lists \nrepresenting gross underestimates. For example, individual fish-collecting expeditions \nin the last two decades have consistently yielded 5 % new species, while an average \nof 2.3 new bird species have been described each  year since 1996 (Peres, 2005). \nAdditionally, the distribution of biodiversity sampling across Amazonia is highly \npatchy and often limited to areas immediately around research stations (e.g. Schulman \net al., 2007). \nImprovements in the cost-effectiveness of biodiversity research in Amazonia are \nurgently needed to overcome these challenges (Higgins and Ruokolainen, 2004; \nGardner et al., 2008; Magnusson et al., 2008), and could be achieved through a \nnumber of complementary approaches, including (1) better use of existing, \nunpublished datasets, (2) use of eco-regional analyses to help identify areas that are \nmost likely to contain new species, (3) development of standardised sampling \nmethods for species groups that rely on passive trapping techniques (e.g. many \ninvertebrates), or which require a high level of field expertise (e.g. birds), (4) \nexploitation of economies of scale in field and laboratory research when conducting \nmult-taxa surveys, and (5) increased investment in training and education \u2013 not only \nof expert taxonomists and dissemination of guides and keys (including web-based ID \ntools), but also local field teams and laboratory technicians who are an essential part \nof any research program. Recent large-scale sampling programs such as the Brazilian \n 13 \nPPBIO project (http:\/\/ppbio.inpa.gov.br\/Eng) have made good progress in these areas \nand it is vital that the momentum is maintained. \n9) Plant taxonomy and biodiversity databases    \nTaxonomic understanding of Amazonian biodiversity is very limited. For example, \n20-40% of tree species described in recent taxonomic monographs were new (e.g. \nPennington, 1997). Our knowledge of the diversity of invertebrates, fungi and micro-\norganisms is particularly rudimentary. The only published reference for more than \nhalf of all known Amazonian insects is restricted to a type locality and species \ndescription (W.L. Overal, personal communication). \n \nIntegrating reliable species identifications into non-taxonomic studies can make a \nmajor contribution towards a better data set, but this is challenging in a diverse, \npoorly documented flora. Botanical organisations are helping by developing user-\nfriendly identification tools (e.g., Neotropikey; \nhttp:\/\/www.kew.org\/science\/tropamerica\/neotropikey.htm), databases integrating \ndistribution data (e.g., Global Biodiversity Information Facility, GBIF), and checklists \nto unravel complex synonymy (e.g. Govaerts et al., 2001). Comparable work on web-\nbased resources is underway on faunal groups, such as web archives of birdsong \n(www.xeno-canto.org) and butterfly images (www.neotropicalbutterflies.com)  \n \nVoucher specimens are needed to verify identifications and as a taxonomic resource, \nbut specimens from ecological studies \u2013 particularly sterile ones in the case of plants \u2013 \nmay never be incorporated into collections and herbaria, and their identifications \nremain unverifiable. To capitalise on data from ecological studies, there is scope for a \nstandard mechanism for sharing and annotating location records and specimen images \nonline.  The Atrium system used by many herbaria (http:\/\/www.atrium-\nbiodiversity.org\/index.html) may provide an appropriate model.  \n \nDNA sequences will have an important future role in facilitating identification and \ntaxonomy. DNA \u201cbarcodes\u201d, short sequences from a standardized genome position, \nare promising for identification, particularly of non-reproductive specimens (e.g., \njuvenile insects and seedlings). If the same barcodes were sequenced for sampling \n 14 \nlocations across the Amazon, the data accumulated would be of enormous use in \ntaxonomy, biogeography and conservation. The cost of DNA sequencing is \ndecreasing, and the limiting factor to implementing such \u201cbiodiversity genomics\u201d will \nbe in collecting leaf samples for DNA extraction and voucher specimens. We urge \nfield workers to make the effort and resource allocation required to collect voucher \nspecimens, digital images and sound recordings. Such effort allied to emerging tools \npromises to deliver a huge improvement of biodiversity knowledge in the world\u2019s \nmost species-rich forest. \n10) Speciation and biogeography \nBiodiversity can be viewed as existing patterns or underlying processes, and both \nperspectives should play a role in conservation strategies (Moritz 2002). This is \nparticularly true in Amazonia, where terrestrial biodiversity reaches its peak for \nreasons that remain poorly understood (Bush, 1994; Haffer, 1997; Colinvaux et al., \n2000). Most explanations rely on populations being historically isolated (Haffer, \n1969; Lovejoy et al., 1998), yet various hypotheses based on forest refugia, riverine \nbarriers and marine incursions receive mixed support at best (e.g. Gascon et al., 2000; \nAleixo, 2004; Hall and Harvey, 2002; Funk et al., 2007). On one hand, recent genetic \nstudies reveal that Amazonian taxa tend to be derived from older lineages in \nneighbouring upland regions, which may have acted as \u2018species pumps\u2019 (Aleixo and \nRossetti, 2007; Santos et al., 2009). On the other hand, they show that dispersal from \nAmazonia may also generate species through divergence in peripheral populations \n(Brumfield and Edwards, 2007, Seddon and Tobias, 2007).  \n \nModern molecular techniques are opening up new challenges and opportunities. \nRecent research shows that Amazonian species tend to have complex \nphylogeographic structure and highly variable divergence times (e.g. Marks et al., \n2002; Whinnett et al., 2005). Moreover, high levels of cryptic diversity have been \nuncovered in Amazonian lineages, suggesting that we may have underestimated the \nregion\u2019s biodiversity and its propensity to generate new species. Further work is \nrequired to explore this issue, as well as the influence of geography and ecology on \nrange limits and speciation. In particular, more phylogeographic studies are needed to \ndisentangle the roles of landscape, history and evolutionary process in structuring \n 15 \nbiological communities across the basin. It seems likely that a combination of \ndisparate factors is involved, and that genes hold the key to unraveling their \ninteraction. The answers will not only help us to understand Amazonian biodiversity, \nbut to predict its response to environmental change, and the best strategies for its \nprotection.   \n. \n11) Amazonian hunting research  \nHunting of forest mammals and birds for food is widespread across Amazonia (Peres \nand Lake, 2003) and the larger species preferred by hunters are often over-exploited \n(Peres, 2000). This is exacerbated by habitat loss in deforested areas (Peres 2001) and \npossibly when colonisation and forest clearance centre on roads and away from \nproductive rivers. Away from the deforestation frontier, the decline of extractive \nindustries and process of rapid urbanization in recent decades (Browder and Godfrey, \n1997) may have alleviated hunting pressure on some animal populations. However, \nmany of these regions are already degraded, and although secondary regrowth on \ncleared lands can support some large vertebrates and provide food to rural people  \n(Smith, 2005), supply is unlikely to sustainably support demand (Parry et al., 2009).  \nHunting research needs to address two major areas of uncertainty. First, the scale of \nurban consumption of hunted wildlife is poorly understood yet is likely to be \nincreasing due to urbanization and increases in urban wealth. There has been only \nlimited use of economics and social science in Amazonian hunting research, unlike in \nAfrica where inter-disciplinary approaches to understanding demand have been \nadopted (e.g. Wilkie et al., 2005). Second, although the extent of sustainable use \nreserves has increased exponentially in recent years it is unclear how hunting in \ninhabited reserves will affect exploited populations and ecosystem functioning \nthrough cascading effects. Encouraging the extraction of non-timber forest products \nmay exacerbate hunting, as the collection of plant products may reduce the \nopportunity costs of hunting wildlife (Parry et al., in press-a). The widespread \nadoption of community management of hunting through no-take areas and catch-per-\nunit-effort monitoring (Puertas and Bodmer, 2004) remains a distant promise. We also \nneed to better understand the interactions between hunting and other forms of forest \n 16 \ndisturbance (Peres, 2001), fishing, and the importance of keystone resources for some \ngame species (Fragoso, 1998).  \n12) Conservation planning      \nThere are ample opportunities for expanding the existing network of forest reserves in \nlowland Amazonia, but capitalizing on this opportunity has so far been a largely ad \nhoc process, A practical approach to designing and siting reserves cannot rely on \ndetailed biodiversity distribution data, which are unavailable for all Amazonian \ncountries (Peres 2002, 2005). Instead, design criteria including the size, habitat \ncomposition, denomination and level of protection of Amazonian reserves have also \nbeen decided haphazardly depending on the local expediency of sociopolitical \ncircumstances, with little attention heeded to lessons learned from policy debates on \nthese topics (Nepstad et al., 2006; Peres & Zimmerman, 2001) or the science of \nreserve allocation and implementation (Peres & Terborgh, 1995; Fearnside & Ferraz, \n1995; Ferreira et al., 1999).  \n \nGiven our current disconcerting level of ignorance of the patterns of biodiversity \ndistribution across Amazonia, vegetation types probably offers the best available \ncoarse-filter surrogate of species turnover for plant and animal assemblages (Scott et \nal., 1993). Natural vegetation types in tropical forest regions reflect baseline \nenvironmental gradients that affect species distributions. In lowland Amazonia, large \nrivers also form important geographic barriers (e.g. Ayres & Clutton-Brock, 1992). A \nset of biogeographic units defined by the overlay of major river barriers and \nvegetation types could therefore be used as a basis for evaluating the representation of \nexisting conservation areas (Peres, 2002).  \n \nThe untested assumption is that a relatively simple gap analysis would capture most \nof the region\u2019s biodiversity without the need to carry out detailed basin-wide species \ninventories. In the short-term, this coarse-grained approach probably offers the best \nhope of achieving a geographically balanced and robust pan-Amazonian nature \nreserve network irrespective of ecoregional differences in species richness, occurrence \nof rare and endemic species, ecosystem vulnerability, and urgency to counteract \nthreats. A limitation of this approach, however, is that it provides little guidance on \nComment [RME8]: My impression was \nthat the ad hoc approach to reserve design \ndescribed here is being superseeded by \nmore coherent attempts to generate mega-\ncorridors (two running N-S and two running \nE-W to form a noughts-and-crosses grid).  \nBut I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever read anything \ndescribing that\u2026 \n 17 \nthe specifics of reserve design, including the size, shape, connectivity, geographic \nposition within watersheds, level of protection of conservation units, and land use in \nthe intervening habitat matrix. \n13) Livelihoods and governance  \nAmazonia smallholder livelihoods are diverse and in flux, influenced by a range of \nfactors (Steward, 2007; de Sherbinin et al., 2008; Pacheco, 2009). Traditional \nlivelihoods can be threatened when forest areas become more accessible to markets \nand cattle ranching becomes preferable to the extensive harvest of non-timber forest \nproducts. For example, rubber tappers in Acre are increasingly expanding their \nlivelihood strategies into small-scale cattle operations, which function as insurance \nand savings strategies (Salisbury and Schmink, 2007).  \n \nLivelihood diversification is an important coping strategy for communities (Pacheco, \n2009) and steady access to capital of some form is needed to ensure household \nresilience (Salisbury and Schmink, 2007). The potential impacts of conditional cash \ntransfer mechanisms on livelihoods (e.g. recent Brazilian government direct-grant \nprograms such as Bolsa Familia, Bolsa Floresta) have increased dramatically (see \nSection 14), as well as increased interactions with urban centers where payments are \nnormally collected and spent. Urban markets and urban opportunities may increase \nrural-urban linkages. Migrants to urban centres in Amazonia often form part of \n\u2018multi-sited households\u2019 partaking in networks across rural-urban areas and in rural \nland-use decisions and helping determine urban markets for food and construction \nmaterials (Padoch et al., 2008).  \n \nMigration across Amazonia is an increasingly important demographic factor (Barbieri \net al., 2009). The declining capacity of farms to maintain families, coupled with soil \ndegradation and reduced agricultural yields, stimulates the next generation to move to \nnew settlements, with consequences for forest conservation (Barbieri et al., 2009). \nThe influence of demographics is particularly important in indigenous communities, \nwhere patterns of settlement expansion are cyclical according to household age (de \nSherbinin et al., 2008).  \n \n 18 \nThe effects of future social, economic and environmental change are likely to vary \nalong gradients of physical accessibility and increasing remoteness from urban centres \nand \u201cthe frontier\u201d. How climate change impacts local decision-making processes and \nrisk management strategies in land-use change are beginning to gain attention (e.g. \nBrondizio and Moran, 2008), but little is known about the way these interplay with \nwider governance strategies that are emerging in Amazonia (e.g. Boyd, 2008). \n \n14) Market-based conservation strategies  \nIt is now well established that the success of conservation policies for inhabited \ntropical forests depends on the inclusion of local populations and recognition of their \nneeds.  Government regulation and the imposition of environmental laws (\u2018fences-\nand-fines\u2019) must be combined with positive incentives which encourage users to \nprotect terrestrial and aquatic resources while strengthening their livelihoods (Fisher \net al., 2008).  The use of market-based strategies as part of a more rounded sustainable \ndevelopment approach has thus become increasingly attractive.  This could find \nexpression through individual private and commercial initiatives or as part of wider \nintegrated conservation and development projects (ICDPs) using a community-based \napproach. \nFor example, although uncontrolled logging continues to be a major source of \nenvironmental destruction in Amazonia, sustainable timber harvesting has expanded \nslowly but steadily to supply niche markets (Ozinga, 2004).  Non-timber forest \nproducts (NTFPs) such as latex, nuts, fruits, oils, resins and medicinal plants have for \ncenturies been exploited by indigenous and traditional populations to meet their own \nneeds.  Nowadays, domestic and international markets for such products have grown \nconsiderably in various sectors including food, cosmetics, medicines, clothing and \nconstruction and ecotourism (Plotkin and Famolare, 2004).  Under the UNFCCC and \nits proposed REDD or \u2018avoided deforestation\u2019 mechanism, carbon trading could \ngenerate significant income for forest peoples (Hall, 2008c). \n \nAlthough such solutions are often portrayed as \u2018win-win\u2019, NTFP and other market-\nbased initiatives face many challenges which result in unduly high transaction costs \n(the \u2018Amazon factor\u2019).  These include: (1) large distances from urban markets; (2) low \nlevels of management, organisational and commercial expertise; (3) inadequate local \n 19 \nproduction, transport, financial and communications infrastructure; (4) vulnerability \nto fluctuations in market prices and consumer demand; (5) growing competition from \nother regions and countries; and (6) assymetrical power relations which may \nmarginalise local groups (Ros-Tonen et al., 2007).  Furthermore, REDD policies will \nface problems of monitoring additionality in carbon sequestration and ecosystem \nservice provision, of balancing social justice with efficiency in the distribution of \nfinanciancial rewards, and of potential threats to the rights of forest dwellers, amongst \nothers (Griffiths, 2007; FOE, 2008). \n \nDiscussion \n \nThese 14 mini-reviews demonstrate the strength and depth of ongoing research efforts \nin the Amazon, but also highlight factors limiting a more complete understanding of \nthe complex web of ecological, economic and social patterns and processes. Many of \nthe barriers to improved research performance (i.e. the efficient production and \ndissemination of reliable knowledge concerning key research priorities) are common \nacross disciplines, and stem partly from a lack of interaction within and between \nnatural and social sciences. Here, we examine how efforts to develop a more \ninteractive research environment could help overcome these barriers and drive \nresearch progress, linking these observations to some of the key research challenges \nidentified by this learning network exercise. We first discuss how improved \ninteraction amongst scientists can enhance research within traditional disciplines, and \nthen examine how interdisciplinary research programs can help scientists engage with \nthe full complexity of the problems facing the Amazon. Finally, we draw upon the \nexperience of our research network exercise to propose ways to build a more \ninteractive research environment.    \n \nImproving research performance by enhancing interaction within scientific \ndisciplines \n \nDeveloping interactive research and learning networks provides substantial benefits \nfor the progress of individual scientific disciplines.  We draw upon our review to \nillustrate how interaction amongst researchers and the development of learning \n 20 \nnetworks can be valuable, if not essential, for confronting five key challenges facing \nscience in Amazonia and elsewhere.  \n \n1. Problem formulation, research design and analysis \nThere is an almost unlimited number of research questions that could be asked \nregarding the environmental and social patterns and processes occurring within the \nAmazon. Many research design choices are at least partially ad hoc and reflect short-\nterm funding opportunities, and time-constraints experienced by relatively isolated \nindividual researchers or research groups. However, the immediacy of most social and \nenvironmental problems means scientists need to adopt a more strategic approach to \nformulating research priorities and attempt to maximise the return on investment from \nlimited resources (Bottrill et al., 2008, Gardner, 2010).  More careful a priori \nconsultation within a wider research network would help establish priorities for new \nresearch, including: the questions and geographic regions that are likely to return the \nmost novel and complementary findings; the extent and quality of prior research \n(published and unpublished); and the practical feasibility (logistics, availability of \nappropriate methods etc.) of implementing fieldwork.   \n \n2. Sharing data, research protocols and research infrastructure \nEnhanced knowledge exchange could improve use of existing data, which are often \nonly known to a few individuals but could help re-direct priorities and the demand for \nnew information following summary assessments and meta-analyses. The \ndevelopment and use of shared research protocols and standardised sampling \ntechniques can significantly increase the efficiency and integrity of research projects \nworking in new areas \u2013 as demonstrated in Amazonia by the RAINFOR network (see \nSection 6). The widespread adoption of standardised methods is also essential in \nallowing such approaches to be constantly validated and improved for different \ncontexts. Recent developments in this area show promise, and include the online \nAmazon spatial mapping tool provided by IMAZON (www.imazongeo.org.br) and \nthe Forest Plots Database, designed to provide a permanent repository for forest \ninventory data (http:\/\/www.forestplots.net\/). Furthermore, there is great potential in \nonline biodiversity information systems to help bridge the gap between the ecological \nand taxonomic sciences (see Sections 8-10 and below).  \n 21 \nSharing research infrastructure among scientists will also facilitate more cost-efficient \nresearch and therefore generate greater scientific returns from limited funds. For \nexample, it takes considerable time and money to train field staff to do specific tasks, \nso making those staff trained in one project available to groups running new projects \nwill steadily increase the efficiency of data collection. Similarly, a centralised \ndatabase of field sites would allow research teams to rapidly identify locations that \nhave prior knowledge of particular aspects of the social-ecological system, thereby \nencouraging access to new sites and greatly facilitating the effectiveness of research \nefforts across the basin. The marginal cost of collecting new information as part of an \nongoing project is negligible compared to the cost of establishing a new project from \nscratch, but for researchers to take advantage of such economies requires a much \nwider sharing of research infrastructure than is currently the case.  \n \n3. Achieving an understanding of scale  \nPerhaps the greatest challenge facing researchers working in the Amazon is its sheer \nsize. Almost all the mini-reviews highlight how our understanding of patterns and \nprocesses across the Amazon basin is limited by insufficient spatial and temporal \nscale and resolution in sampling. Most research is strongly aggregated spatially, and \nin some disciplines such as landscape ecology the majority of existing information is \nderived from an extremely small number of well-studied sites (Gardner et al. 2009, \nand Section 7). This constrained sampling would matter less if Amazonian forests, \nrivers and peoples were homogeneous, but evidence demonstrates otherwise. Many \nresearch questions in Amazonia can only be addressed by integrating datasets from \nacross multiple locations and contexts as it is becoming increasingly clear that \ndifferent forest types function in very different ways (Section 6, 10), while human-\nenvironment interactions vary greatly depending on historical and regional context \n(Fearnside, 2008, Section 13).  \n \nTemporal data is also critical for unravelling many complex problems. For example, \nwe currently have a poor understanding of the longer-term ecological consequences of \nland-use change, as few research projects last more than a few years. However, the \nfew ecological studies that explicitly considered disturbance history as an explanatory \nvariable have shown it to have a dominant effect on extant biodiversity patterns (e.g. \nchanges in biodiversity following forest disturbance or fragmentation; Sections 3 and \n 22 \n7). Many human-environment interactions are also highly dynamic over time, \nconfounding attempts by short-term studies to identify reliable drivers of change (e.g. \nEwers et al. 2008).  \n \nImproved communication and collaboration among research groups is likely to be the \nmost effective way to achieve improved spatial and temporal sample replication. The \nRAINFOR network provides an effective template for how integrated research \nnetworks can work, and what they can achieve. By linking more than 90 researchers \nfrom multiple South American and international institutions, RAINFOR has \nharmonized the data collection methods of scientists working in 130 permanent plots \nlocated at 41 geographically distinct sites across Amazonia, producing important \ninsights into how forests change over time and space and how they may respond to \nfuture environmental change (Sections 5, 6). It would be impossible for a single \nresearch group to develop a project with such a wide geographical and temporal base. \nThe RAINFOR network is made up of a consortium of research groups who maintain \nindependent lines of investigation, yet share an interest in a common set of large-scale \nprocesses influencing vegetation dynamics in Amazonia. This shared interest justifies \nthe marginal cost of adjusting or complementing existing sampling methodologies and \nalleviates the need for top-down labour- and cost-intensive project management.   \n \n4. Keeping up with the cutting edge  \nProgress in science is not linear. New insights, theory and technological developments \ncan emerge very rapidly, making it difficult for individual researchers \u2013 especially \nthose working in isolated and poorly funded institutions \u2013 to keep their science up-to-\ndate and cost-effective. New developments frequently spawn sub-disciplines and\/or \ncentres of excellence associated with particular research groups, further dividing the \nlearning process. Examples of this are easy to find in high-technology fields such as \nremote-sensing, where new indices of land-cover change and degradation from \nincreasingly high resolution imagery are constantly out-dating previous techniques \n(e.g. Chambers et al. 2007, and see Sections 2, 7). In a similar way, the use of DNA \ntechnology and emerging techniques such as bar-coding has led to the field of \nsystematics being divided amongst those who have access to genetic laboratories and \nthose that do not, generating considerable controversy and confusion regarding the \nvalidity and utility of new developments (e.g. Kress & Erikson 2008).  \n 23 \n \nPromoting an effective dialogue within a research community can provide a means to \nallow busy or under-resourced scientist\u2019s access to the state of the art science in \nrelated disciplines, as well as help prevent the excessive fragmentation of scientific \ndisciplines. This is critically important in the applied sciences, as many new policy \nand market-based conservation initiatives are developing so fast that there is a serious \nrisk that science will lag behind, and will fail to inform the development of these \ninitiatives. A clear example of this is provided by the many Reduced Emissions from \nDeforestation and Degradation (REDD) projects, incentivised by the UNFCCC \nconference in Copenhagen in December of 2009, which would benefit from a \ncoordinated approach underpinned by robust science (see Fig. 1). \n \n5. Enhancing scientific impact and dissemination \nMost researchers disseminate their science in peer-reviewed journals, and there is \noften a lag-period of years before even the most important results are incorporated \ninto the design and interpretation of subsequent work. These delays can be greatly \nreduced through research networks, which can exploit multi-media communication \nchannels (e.g. email list-serves, online discussion forums, web-based scientific \nmeetings etc) to disseminate key findings, helping the research community to avoid \npast mistakes and maximising the return on investment from new research initiatives. \nMoreover, a more interactive scientific community can increase the policy impact and \nsocietal awareness of research by working to achieve consensus findings, making \njoint press releases, and pooling resources to develop novel communication tools. \n \nImproving research performance by increasing interaction across disciplines \n \nCalls for interdisciplinary research in environmental conservation are not new (Kinzig \n2001) but have been increasing, reflected by the rapid development of conservation \nscience as an inherently interdisciplinary field concerned with understanding complex \nhuman-environment relationships in the search for sustainability (Robinson 2008; \nLowe et al. 2009; Cooke et al. 2009).  Interdisciplinarity is particularly relevant for \nunderstanding processes in human-modified tropical forests, which are both \necologically and socially complex, as well as highly dynamic. Successful inter-\ndisciplinary research will benefit from research networks in the same way as intra-\n 24 \ndisciplinary research (points 1-5 above), although there are obvious and substantial \nadditional benefits that can be gained from the establishment of an interactive \nresearch environment.  \n \nAt the simplest level our research network exercise highlighted several pairwise \ninteractions between disciplines that could generate significant reciprocal benefits. \nFor example, the link between the taxonomic and ecological sciences could be greatly \nstrengthened. At present many of the biodiversity specimens collected during \necological research fail to make it into museum collections or herbariums, while \necologists frequently rely upon outdated guide books when making identifications \n(Section 9). Given that taxonomists (and biogeographers) require specimens from as \nwide a range of localities as possible and ecologists and conservation biologists \nrequire accurate species data, there is a clear benefit for these two groups to work \nmore closely together. Once again, the increasing number of online resources plays an \nimportant role in facilitating this interaction.  \n \nAnother mutually beneficial pairwise interaction exists between field ecologists and \nthe remote sensing community. Remote sensing scientists approximate real patterns of \necological change, while fieldworkers are often interested in extrapolating direct \nmeasurements of ecological phenomena from small sampling localities to landscapes \nand regions. Given this apparent inter-dependence it is unclear why only a very small \nnumber of studies have attempted to link newly developed indices of canopy \ndegradation (e.g. Normalised Vegetation Fraction Index, Souza et al. 2005) with field \nbiodiversity data (e.g. Aguilar-Amuchastegui & Henebry 2007), despite the fact that \nsevere forest degradation currently threatens a much larger area of forest in the \nAmazon than deforestation (Asner et al. 2005; Peres et al. 2006).  \n \nInterdisciplinary approaches are also critical when confronting environmental \nproblems whose characteristics do not allow a clean separation of social, ecological \nand biogeophysical phenomena (Kinzig 2001; Liu et al. 2007). One of the strongest \nconclusions to emerge from our learning network exercise was the high level of \ninterdependency that underpins many observed phenomena, both within and between \nthe social and ecological sciences. One example is the process of road building. \nDespite being a critical factor in the development of deforestation models (e.g. \n 25 \nSoares-Filho et al. 2006) there have been very few successful validations of road-\nbuilding models against actual field data (see Section 2). Moreover, roads are only \nproximate drivers of deforestation and their construction is underpinned by a complex \narray of biophysical and socioeconomic drivers (Perz et al. 2007). It is likely that \ndeforestation models could be greatly improved by more effectively harnessing this \nsocioeconomic information, allowing the evaluation of the impact of more nuanced \ndevelopment scenarios on patterns of deforestation and changing land-use (Section 2).   \n \nInterdisciplinary studies are also essential to understand the potential for cascades and \nfeedback effects in human-modified forest ecosystems (Gardner et al. 2009). For \nexample it is well known that the perturbation of ecological systems can precipitate \ncascading effects, such as those caused by over-hunting of large vertebrates on the \ncomposition of plant communities (e.g. Terborgh et al. 2008), though changes to the \necological system can also have important feedbacks on the coupled social system. In \nanother example increased fires can reduce the value of the forest for non-timber \nforest products (NTFPs) (Sinha & Brault 2005), encouraging a shift in livelihoods \ntowards farming and increasing the risk of fires occurring in neighbouring areas of \nforest in the future. The possibility of severe climate change in the Amazon could lead \nto an increasing number of feedbacks between climate, ecological and social systems \n(Malhi et al. 2008).  \n \nLike many areas of the world, the Amazon is experiencing rapid and unpredictable \nchanges in its underlying governance structure, with shifts from centralised \ncommand-control systems to de-centralised governance and the emergence of public-\nprivate, voluntary and market-based conservation strategies (Boyd 2008). A major \ndriver of these changes is the promise offered by novel forest conservation finance \nthrough ecosystem services markets, and in particular Reduced Emissions from \nDeforestation and Degradation (REDD; http:\/\/www.undp.org\/mdtf\/un-\nredd\/overview.shtml). Understanding the opportunities and challenges posed by \nREDD is a quintessentially interdisciplinary problem that requires a variety of \nmethodological approaches as well as disciplinary expertise from nearly all the areas \nof research analysed in this paper, including questions of ecological and social \nviability, forest management and monitoring, livelihoods and market dynamics (Fig. \n1). Researchers must actively embrace this interdisciplinary approach from the outset \n 26 \nif science is to make a genuine contribution to a more sustainable future for \nAmazonia: integration is essential to ensuring that the right variables are collected at \nappropriate spatial and temporal scales, and that researchers from individual \ndisciplines are aware from an early stage of the assumptions and pervasive uncertainty \nconfronting any interdisciplinary analysis (Kinzig 2001; Cooke et al. 2009). Research \nand learning networks provide a vital first step in this process of integration. \n \nEffective communication provides the basis of an interactive research \nenvironment  \n \nWhile successful collaborations between scientists from the same or different \ndisciplines can bring many advantages, they can be deceptively difficult to establish. \nFrequently, they are driven by chance encounters and differences in personal interest \nand trust amongst individuals as much as by scientific priorities. Fortunately, one \nbasic yet important lesson from our learning and research network exercise is that \nthere are many ways of benefiting from increased interaction without entering into \nfull collaboration, and research performance can also be improved through enhancing \ncommunication and coordination among scientists engaged in independent yet related \nresearch activities (Fig. 2).  \n \nDespite being the least ambitious form of interaction, effective communication both \nwithin and among disciplines provides an essential basis for identifying high-priority \nresearch questions and helps ensure the best use of limited resources by avoiding \nrepetitive or unfeasible work (Fig. 2). Communication of published work is often \nhindered by an excess of subject-specific jargon (Ewers and Rodrigues, 2006) as well \nas by linguistic and financial constraints, which means that scientists working in \ndeveloping and developed countries use very different sources of information (Pitman \net al., 2007). Research development could be strengthened and accelerated through \nmulti-disciplinary reviews, such as the one developed here, which encourage simpler \nterminology, as well as the communication of a wide range of other types of \ninformation, including unpublished findings, proven field methods and analytical \napproaches, untested research hypotheses and ideas, published and unpublished \nliterature, ongoing independent research projects, funding opportunities and \nrecommendations on field logistics. Unfortunately the exchange of many of these \n 27 \nforms of information is frequently limited by a lack of time as well as concern that \nsharing privileged information will compromise individual research performance and \nintellectual property.   \n \nBarriers preventing interactive and interdisciplinary research \nThere are many potential barriers that could prevent a more interactive and \ninterdisciplinary research environment from developing. Many of these are structural, \nrelating to the scarcity (or inequality) of funding, disciplinary institutional traditions \nand organizational structures, inadequate interdisciplinary training and insufficient \nrewards for integrative research (Kinzig 2001; Fisher et al. 2009). However, there is \ngrowing evidence that these structural barriers are being weakened by new \ninterdisciplinary funding programs, and a focus towards assessing the actual impact of \nresearch programs (see the proposed arrangements for the assessment and funding of \nresearch in UK higher education institutions; \n(http:\/\/www.hefce.ac.uk\/pubs\/hefce\/2009\/09_38\/).  \n \nPerhaps a more serious barrier to interdisciplinary research is behavioural, and relates \nto the values and attitudes held by researchers working in different disciplines (Kinzig \n2001; Lele & Norgaard 2005). Whether intended or not, the values held by individual \nscientists manifest themselves during collaborative research exercises in the form of \nimplicit assumptions regarding the relative utility of other disciplines and \nmethodological approaches in tackling a given problem. The personal experience of a \nnumber of authors of this paper indicates that achieving an atmosphere of mutual \nrespect within an interdisciplinary project can be frustratingly difficult and requires \nconsiderable patience, acceptance of uncertainty as part of the research process, and a \nwillingness to be constructive and withhold subjective judgement when confronted \nwith alternative world-views. Participants in interdisciplinary projects need to be self-\nreflective about their own value judgements and should work to achieve a common \nlanguage for discussing fundamental issues and seek to identify a core set of shared \nvalues as a motivation for integration (Lele & Norgaard 2005). We believe that the \ncollaborative development of multidisciplinary research syntheses such as that \npresented in this paper is an important first step towards achieving these aims. \n \nConclusions and recommendations \n 28 \n \nProactive efforts to build a more interactive research environment are necessary to \nimprove the performance and efficiency of scientific research and help answer \nglobally important scientific questions. Our experience of writing this manuscript \nindicates there is an impressive willingness from researchers across different \ndisciplines to work together to achieve this. The production of portfolios of short and \ncritical syntheses on the status and direction of individual disciplines, such as that \npresented here, can provide a very useful and accessible briefing on potential \ninterdisciplinary research opportunities, as well as an entry point for dialogue among \nscientists who may otherwise have little understanding of eachothers\u2019 work. To \nencourage this, journals should provide space for and actively encourage such \nsyntheses which are complementary to the more traditional single-discipline reviews \nand more subjective inter-disciplinary perspective-type pieces that are often led by a \nsmall and potentially biased group of researchers. Learning networks can then form \nthe basis for developing a more collaborative research environment that reaches \nbeyond more traditional means of knowledge exchange, and provides a basis for \nimproved research performance within and among disciplines.  \n \nReferences \nAguilar-Amuchastegui, N. & Henebry, G.M.
