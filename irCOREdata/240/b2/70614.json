Methods: Skin LDF was performed on all extremities in 58 patients 4 - 9 days after AMI (Killip class I), and in 71 healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Wavelet analysis was applied to evaluate oscillatory components within the interval 0.005-2 Hz. Results: AMI patients had reduced mean flow (p < 0.01) and oscillatory components (p < 0.04) in all extremities. Reperfused (n = 40), compared to nonreperfused ( n = 18), patients had higher mean flow and total spectral amplitude at all recording points. The difference was statistically significant only in legs ( group median LDF in the left leg was 9.68 AU for reperfused and 5.71 AU for nonreperfused patients, p < 0.04, and 11.47 and 4.24 AU in the right leg, p < 0.01).
