The optimization is carried out by applying an ant colony algorithm (ACA) \nwith the ply contiguous constraint taken into account. The finite strip method is employed in \nthe buckling analysis of the stiffened panels. The results shows that the buckling load increases \ndramatically with the number of stiffeners at first, and then has only a small improvement after \nthe number of stiffeners reaches a certain value. An optimal layup of the skin and stiffener \nlaminate has also been obtained by using the ACA.

Introduction \nComposite materials are becoming increasingly employed in aerospace structures because of \ntheir high specific stiffness and specific strength. Since laminated composite stiffened panels \nare much more efficient in load carrying ability than unstiffened plates, they are widely adapted \nin aircraft wing and fuselage structural configuration. When a thin composite panel is subjected \nto compressive load, it could result in global or local buckling as the critical structural failure \nmode. The stiffeners can enhance the structural stiffness, and therefore the buckling resistance \nof the structure effectively. To further improve the structural efficiency, optimization of \ncomposite stiffened panels to maximize the buckling loads has drawn considerable attention in \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 2\nrecent years. Usually, a composite stiffened panel in aerospace structure comprises of a skin \nand stiffeners made of different laminate layup. The geometric parameters and stacking \nsequences of the skin and stiffeners affect the buckling load of the stiffened panel, and hence \nthe optimization of both parameters should be performed simultaneously.  \nRecently, the optimum buckling design of composite stiffened plate with various stiffeners, \nloading conditions and aspect ratios has been studied by some researchers using different \nmethods. S.Nagendra [1] proposed an improved genetic algorithm (GA) to find the best \nstacking sequence of the skin and stiffeners laminate, and the stiffener height for minimum \nweight of a composite stiffened panel under buckling constraint. In this study, an optimized \ndesign with weight saving by about 4% was obtained. In Ref.[2], Ji-Ho Kang, Chun-Gon Kim \npresented a minimum weight design of composite plates under compressive load and composite \nstiffened panels under post buckling strength constraint. In this study, the size and location of \nthe stiffeners were considered as the design variables. In Ref.[3], Akira Todoroki presented a \nstacking sequence optimization to maximize the buckling load of blade-stiffened panels with \nstrength constraint using the iterative fractal branch and bound method. In this procedure, the \nstrength constraint was implemented by means of a response surface. The results show that an \noptimal stacking sequence of the stiffened panel can be obtained by this method at a low \ncomputational cost. In Ref.[4], M.M.Alinia investigated the optimization of plate stiffeners \nsubjected to shear load. The study has shown that the optimum geometric properties of the \nstiffeners are related to the point when the plate buckling shape changes from a global mode to \nlocal mode. M.Walker [5] studied the effect of the stiffener arrangement and boundary \nconditions on the optimal ply angles and the buckling load. In Ref.[6], Bedair studied the \ninfluence of stiffener location on the stability of stiffened plates in compression and plane \nbending. The results have shown that the optimum location for the stiffener depends on the \nrelative proportions of the plate and the stiffener, and is not always at one fifth of the plate \nwidth as recommended by several design specifications. All these previous studies have \ncontributed to useful guidelines, which help the design of stiffened panels under some loading \nconditions. However, there is no publication focused on the optimum number of stiffeners for \nthe maximum buckling load of composite stiffened panels under weight constraint. \nThe Ant Colony Algorithm (ACA) is one of the latest heuristic optimization methods. \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 3\nInspired by the behavior of ant colonies in foraging food, the method was developed and \nintroduced in early 1990s by Dorigo et al [7]. The search mechanism of ACA is based on the \nants\u2019 capability of finding the shortest path from a food source to their nest. The ants leave a \npheromone trail on their way and each ant chooses its path with respect to the probability \ndepending on the pheromone trails laid by the previous ants. These pheromone trails \nprogressively decrease by evaporation. Each ant probabilistically prefers to choose a path of \nrich pheromone. The ACA was first applied to the TSP in 1982, and from then its application \nhas been widely extended to other fields of combinational optimization problems such as \nquadratic assignment, vehicle routing and graph coloring. Since then the method has been \nsuccessfully applied to several Non-deterministic Polynomial (NP) Solvable-difficult \ncombinatorial optimization problems, such as traveling salesman problem (TSP)[8]. ACA was \nalso used to solve some engineering problems such as the feeder bus network design problem \n[9] and process engineering problems [10]. In Ref.[11], F.Aymerich and M.Serra studied the \napplication of ACA to the layup optimization of laminated panels for maximum buckling load. \nThe results show that the average performance and the robustness of ACA search strategy are \ncomparable or better than that of optimization procedure based on GA or Tabu Search (TS). \nAs one of the most popular combinatorial optimization problems [12], the traveling \nsalesman problem (TSP) can be described as finding the best order of N cities for a salesman or \ntraveler to visit in the shortest total length of the travel route. Each city must be visited once \nonly. At the end, the traveler must return to the starting city to make a closed loop route. The \nTSP is a simple combinatorial problem and used as a benchmark method to compare new \napproaches in combinatorial optimization. Many literatures have been published to study the \nTSP, many practical problems such as machine scheduling, cellular manufacturing can be easily \nformulated as a TSP. apart from the basic TSP, some variations TSP such as GTSP (the \ngeneralized TSP)[13], TSPP (TSP with Profits)[14] has been introduced to simulate the real \nword problems.   \nIn this current paper, a modified TSP and ACA is introduced and used for optimum \nbuckling design of laminated composite skin panels with different number of stiffeners without \nweight penalty. The design variables include ply thickness of the skin and stiffener laminates \nand the stiffener height. The contiguous ply number no more than four is imposed as constraint. \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 4\nESDU a0301[15] program based on finite strip method was used to calculate the buckling load \nof the composite stiffened panels. The ACA was used to optimize the skin and stiffener ply \nthickness and the stiffened height. \n \n2. Problem definition \nA composite outer wing designed for a multi role large aircraft is taken as the example to \ndemonstrate the analysis and optimization process. As illustrated in Fig.1a, the wing box \nstructure made of composite laminate was divided into 21 thin walled box sections by 22 ribs. \nT-shape stiffeners were chosen for the upper skin reinforcement. The rib and stiffener pitch \nwere selected based on the design guideline of a conventional wing box configuration in the \ninitial design. In this paper, the upper skin panel of the No. 10 wing box section as illustrated in \nFig.1b is taken as an example in the optimization analysis. \nThe geometric details of the original upper skin panel are shown in Fig.2. The stiffened \npanel is 2.10m in length and 1.05m in width and comprise of 8 equally spaced T-shape \nstiffeners. The detailed configuration of the stiffeners is shown in Fig.3. The height of the blade \nis H=0.0675m, and the width of the flange b2=0.07m. The skin and stiffener laminate layup is \nsymmetric and balanced and made of 02, \u00b145 and 902 degree plies considering manufacture \nconstraint. In order to prevent excessive interlamina stress, a ply contiguous constraint was \ntaken to restrict the number of adjacent plies of the same fiber orientation up to four or less. The \nstiffener blade and flange were constrained to have the same laminate layup.  \nThe stiffened panel is simply supported along the four edges and subjected to compressive \nload. A reference compressive load of Nx =1 N\/m is applied in the x-axis direction. The \nbuckling load of the composite stiffened panels is calculated by using the code in ESDU03001 \nbased on finite strip method [15]. Previous study has shown that the result by using ESDU \n03001 agrees with the finite element method very well [16].  \nThe objective of the optimization in the current paper is to find the optimum thickness of \nthe skin and stiffener and the optimum height of the blade to maximize the buckling load of the \nstiffened panel without weight penalty. The objective function of the optimization is the critical \nbuckling load bcrF  of the stiffened panel. The design variables are thickness of the skin panel \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 5\nsT , the stiffener blade bT  and flange fT  and the blade height H . In the optimization process, \nthe stiffened panel weight totalW  or the cross section area of the stiffened plate S, which is \nproportional to totalW  is kept constant. To satisfy the weight constraint, the blade height H is \ntaken as a function of the other design variables as expressed below rather than an independent \nvariable. \n    \n2 fs\nb b\nb TS b TH\nN T T\n\u22c5\n\u2212 \u22c5\n= \u2212\n\u22c5\n                               (1) \nwhere N is the number of stiffeners, b is the panel width and b2 is the stiffener flange width. In \norder to ensure the laminate is balanced and symmetric and reduce the number of the design \nvariables in the same time, only half of the laminate plies was optimized and the layup was \nrestricted to two ply building stacks in an option of 02, \u00b145 and 902. The number of contiguous \nplies of the same fibre orientation is limited to no more than four in the optimization process. \nThe optimization problem can be formulated as to maximize the critical load Fcr of the stiffened \npanel by finding the optimum thickness and laminate stacking sequence of the skin panel and \nstiffeners and the blade height. \n                    Minimize 1( , , )obj cr s b f\nF\nF T T T\n=                        (2) \n                   Subject to totalW = constant    and ( ) 4g \u03b8 \u2264  \nwhere Fobj is the objective function, Fcr is the critical load of the stiffened panel depending upon \nthe design variables, which is the critical buckling load; ( )g \u03b8  is the number of contiguous \nplies of the same orientation.  \n \n3. Implement of the ACA \n \n3.1 ACA coding \nAs described above, the design variables of the optimization problem in this paper include \nthe thicknesses and laminate stacking sequence of skin and the stiffeners blade and flange. An \noptimum thickness can be obtained by adjusting the number of plies of the laminate. In the \nACA, the three optional ply stacks 02, \u00b145 and 902 were represented by three codes 1, 2 and 3 \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 6\nin a string respectively. Although the laminate thickness of the skin and stiffeners is varied \nduring the optimization process, the length of the string representing the laminate layup and \ncorresponding to the upper bound of the laminate thicknesses is fixed in the process. To \nrepresent laminate layup with a thickness smaller than the upper bound, an empty ply stack \nrepresented by E in the string was introduced to change the laminate thickness without altering \nthe string length. Thus, there are four optional stacks 02, \u00b145, 902 and an empty stack \nrepresented by code 1, 2, 3 and E in the string. Since the empty stack E bit is only used to keep \nthe string in a predefined length, it should be removed first when we encode the string. For \nexample, a string of length 12 {2 2 E 2 1 2 1 1 3 1 1 2} representing a laminate made of up to \n48 plies could be encoded for a 44-ply symmetric laminate of [\u00b1453\/02\/\u00b145\/04\/902\/04\/\u00b145]s. In \nthe string, the first code 2 corresponds to the outermost ply stack and the last 2 corresponds to \nthe one closest to the plane of symmetry of the laminate. In this manner, the laminate thickness \nand layup optimization may be formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem of the four \noptions of the ply stacks 02, 902, \u00b145 and E. \nFor the case of more than one laminate to be optimized, each laminate can be coded as one \nsub-string and all sub-strings can be put together in a single string to represent all the laminates. \nFor the panel made of two different laminate with the maximum number of ply stacks 7 and 5 \nfor the skin and stiffeners respectively, a single string of 12 bit was created, in which the first 7 \nbits represents the skin laminate and the second part 5 bits represents the stiffener laminate as \nillustrated in Fig.4.  \n \n3.2 multi city-layer TSP \nIn this paper, a new version of traveling salesman problem (TSP) called Multi city-layer \nTSP (MCLTSP) is introduced and a corresponding ACA called MCLACA is developed. The \noptimization problem of the composite stiffened panel presented in section 2 is modeled as a \nMCLTSP. \nIn the MCLTSP, the N cities representing the laminate plies form a city-matrix of \ncity-layers. A 48-ply laminate can be described a 48-city MCLTSP and modeled as a ??12 \ncity-matrix in 4 lines and 12 columns as shown in Fig.5. The four cites in one column is called \na city-layer; the city matrix is called a multi city-layer system. For example, the matrix shown \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 7\nin Fig.5 is a 12 city-layer system. The traveler must start the tour from one of the cities in the \nfirst city-layer and visit each city-layer only once until the last one. The traveler can visit \nneither the city again in the same city-layer nor any city in a city-layer, which has been visited. \nIn such an open loop route, there is one and only one city being visited in each city-layer. \nComparing with the basic TSP, it is noted that not all cities but all the city-layers are visited in \nMCLTSP. When the traveler reached the last city-layer, the tour was completed and the path can \nbe represented by the city number being visited. Each completed route produces a solution by \nthe MCLTSP. For example, the path shown in Fig.5 can be expressed by {2 1 3 E 1 2 1 E 1 2 E \n1} to represent a laminate layup [\u00b145\/02\/902\/02\/\u00b145\/02\/02\/\u00b145\/02]. \nTo achieve the objective of finding a shortest route corresponding to an optimum laminate \nstacking sequence, it is necessary to map the laminate optimization process to a MCLTSP. In \nthe laminate optimization, each ply stack has four options {E 1 2 3}, which can be modeled as a \ncity-layer. Take Fig.5 as example, the 12 city-layer represents the maximum number of ply \nstacks in the laminate. A complete route containing 12 cities represents one solution for the \nlaminates layup. The length of the path is corresponding to an objective function value in terms \nof the buckling load of the stiffened panel. In this manner, the composite optimal design \nproblem can be modeled as a MCLTSP. The laminate optimal design problem for the maximum \ncritical buckling load can be transferred to searching for the shortest route in the MCLTSP.  \n \n3.3 Multi City Layer Ant Colony Algorithm (MCLACA) \nIn the current paper, an ACA based algorithm called multi city layer ACA (MCLACA) is \npresented to apply the ACA to the laminate stacking sequence optimization problem. Similar to \nthe MCLTSP, the cities are grouped into N city layers. Similarly to the basic ACA for TSP, an \nintensity of trail information is used to simulate the pheromone of ants. We denote the intensity \nof trail information between city i  in the ( 1)thN \u2212  city-layer and city j in the thN  layer as \n( , , 1)i j N\u03c4 \u2212 , where , 1, 2,i j n= \u0001 , n is the number of cities in a city-layer. Since a priori trail \ninformation is not available, we first initiate the intensity matrix of trail information as a fixed \nnumber 0\u03c4 . Suppose m  is the total number of ants, the ants was initially distributed to the \ncities in the first city layer randomly in the first step and then all ants move to the city in the \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 8\nsecond city layer. For an ant in city i of the (k-1)th city-layer, the probability for the ant to visit \nthe city j in the kth city layer can be written in a formula as follows \n \n                 \n0arg max {[ ( , , )] } ,\notherwise,\nkj allowed\ni j k q q\nj\nS\n\u03b1\u03c4\n\u2208\n\uf8f1 <\uf8f4\n= \uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f3\n i f  \n              (3) \nWhere \u03b1  represents the degree of relative importance of the trail information; q is a \nvalue chosen randomly with uniform probability in [0, 1]; 0q is a given parameter and S is a \nrandom variable selected according to the following probability distribution, which has a higher \nlevel of pheromone trail: \n                     \n( , , )( , ) ( , , )\nku allowed\ni j kP i j\ni j k\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\n\u2208\n= \u2211                          (4) \n   The pheromone trail is updated by two kinds of updating: local updating and global \nupdating. When all ants have completed its tours, if the edge is chosen by an ant m , its amount \nof pheromone will be changed through the following local trail updating formula: \n     ( , , ) (1 ) ( , , ) ( )i j k i j k L m\u03c4 \u03be \u03c4 \u03be\u2190\uf8e7 \u2212 \u22c5 + \u22c5               (5) \nwhere \u03be  is a parameter, ( )L m  is the path length of ant m .  \nLocal trail updating is motivated by the trail evaporation of real ants to avoid a high \nfrequency selection of the same route by all the ants that could cause premature solutions and \nlocal convergence. When all the ants have completed their tours in an iteration, each ant has a \ncomplete path which represents a layup configuration of laminate. Subsequently the objective \nfunction in terms of buckling load factor was calculated by using the ESDU 03001 with the \nresult counted as the route length of the corresponding ant in the ACA. The best ant deposits \npheromone on the visited edges in its tour while the other edges remain unchanged. The amount \nof pheromone \u03c4\u2206  deposited on each visited edge by the best ant is proportional to the length \nof the tour. Global trail updating is similar to a reinforcement learning scheme in which a better \nsolution will obtain a higher reinforcement. The global trail updating formula is expressed by \nEq.(6): \n    \u03c4\u03c4\u03c1\u03c4 \u2206+\u22c5\u2212\uf8e7\uf8e7\u2190 ),,()1(),,( kjikji                     (6) \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 9\n      )1,0(\u2208\u03c1  \n     \n\/ ( , ) the shortest path\n( , ) the longest path\n0 others\ngb\nworst\nbest\nL if i j\nL if i j\nL\n\u03c1\n\u03c4 \u03b5\n\uf8f1 \u2208\uf8f4\uf8f4\u2206 = \u2212 \u22c5 \u2208\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\n \n    The laminate layup symmetry as a constraint is realized by optimizing only half of the \nlaminate with the other half following it. The balanced layup constraint is satisfied by \nrestricting the optional ply stacks to 02, \u00b145 and 902. The ply contiguity constraint is satisfied in \nthe selection of the city to visit in the search route. Before visiting a new city, the ant or traveler \nchecks and compares the current city with the previous two cities just visited to avoid selecting \nthe same city as being visited twice continuously. When applied to the laminate optimisation, \nthis process limits the contiguous ply stacks up to two or the number of contiguous plies of the \nsame fibre orientation up to four except for \u00b145 plies. For example, a route path [3 2 2 2 1 1] \ntaken by an ant after visiting six city-layers can be encoded as [902\/\u00b145\/\u00b145\/\u00b145\/02\/02]. Since \nthere are four contiguous 0 plies in the current laminate, the next city for the ant to visit can \nonly be selected from {2, 3}. While the city \u20181\u2019 representing \u201c02\u201d ply stack should be excluded.  \nThe procedure of the MCLACA can be described as follows with its implementation to the \nlaminate stacking sequence optimization problem as illustrated in Fig.6. \n \n   Step 1:  Set up parameters and initialize pheromone trails \n   Step 2:  Allocate the ants to the cities of the first city-layer randomly. \n   Step 3:  Every ant must walk to a city in the next city-layer depending on the probability  \ndistribution given in Eq.(3) or (4) \n   Step 4:  Perform a local update of pheromone according to Eq.(5) \n   Step 5:  Calculate the length of all ant paths in terms of laminate buckling load by using  \nthe ESDU program; identify the best and the worst ant and perform a global  \nupdate of pheromone according to Eq.(6) \n   Step 6:  If the iteration reaches the maximum number, stop the process; otherwise repeat  \nsteps 2-5. \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 10\n4 Results and Discussion \n \nIn this paper, a laminate plate was taken as a benchmark case study to validate the \nproposed MCLACA before applying the method to the optimization of a composite stiffened \npanel. The study shows the effect of panel laminate stacking sequence, the number and \ngeometry of the stiffeners on the buckling load and optimization of a composite panel.  \n \n4.1 Validation of the MCLACA \n \nTo validate the proposed MCLACA, a benchmark case study was conducted to maximize \nthe load carrying capability of a simply supported rectangular composite plate. In this case, the \ncritical load for the objective function was either the critical buckling or strain failure load \nwhichever is lower. The carbon\/epoxy laminate plate of length a=508 mm and width b=127 mm \nis made of N=48 plies with ply thickness t=0.127mm and the building ply stacks limited to 02, \n\u00b145 and 902. The laminate material properties are E1=127.57GPa, E2=13.03GPa, G12=6.41GPa, \nv12=0.3 and the ultimate strains are \u03b51ua=0.008, \u03b52ua=0.029, \u03b312=0.3. A safety factor of 1.5 is \nconsidered in the strength constraint.  \nThe plate is subjected to an in-plane biaxial compressive load xN\u03bb  and yN\u03bb , where \n\u03bb is a load factor. The critical buckling load factor cb\u03bb and the strain failure load factor cf\u03bb  is \ndefined as the ratio of the laminate buckling load and strain failure load against the applied load \nrespectively. In this particular stacking sequence optimization, the bcrF  in the objective \nfunction expressed in Eq.(2) is replaced by the smaller c\u03bb  between the factor cb\u03bb and cf\u03bb  \ncorresponding to the maximum buckling load and strain value of the laminate. Three load cases \nwith load ratios of \/ 0.125,0.25,y xN N\u03bb \u03bb = and 0.5 were considered. The symmetric and \nbalanced layup ad ply contiguous constrains as described earlier were considered.  \nThe optimal results of the MCLACA in comparison with the results obtained by the GA in \nRef.[17] and the B&BL (Branch and bound and linearization) in Ref.[3] are shown in Table 1. \nThe results show that when the load ratio reached Ny\/Nx=0.5, the failure mode changed from \nstrain failure to buckling failure. The results also indicate that the proposed MCLACA is \ncapable of identifying both failure modes and finding an equivalent or better solution than the \nGA and B&BL. \n \n \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 11\nTable 1.

The study was started for the skin laminate \nwithout stiffeners and then with stiffeners. The dimension of the panel is a=2.1m in length and \nb=1.05m in width. The laminate is made of 72 plies of ply thickness 0.184mm in a symmetric \nand balanced layup. The plate is simply supported along its four edges and subjected to biaxial \ncompressive forces. The carbon\/epoxy IM7 Hexply8552-7 material properties are shown in \nTable 2. In this case, only the critical buckling load was taken for the objective function without \nconsidering the critical strain. \n \n Table 2.

The optimization is \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 12\nsubject to the symmetric and balanced layup and ply contiguous constraints as described earlier. \nTable 3 shows the optimal results of the plate compared with the initial design. \n \nTable 3. Optimal results of the unstiffened laminated composite plate \nDesign cases Stacking sequence Buckling load (105N) \nInitial design [(\u00b145\/02\/902)6]s 3.29 \nOptimal design [((902)2\/\u00b145)6]s 5.02 \n \nTable 3 shows that the stacking sequence of the laminated plate has a large effect on the \nbuckling load. The 902 ply stacks were increased; the 02 ply stacks removed; the \u00b145 plies \nremained to satisfy the ply contiguous constraints. As the result, the buckling load of the \noptimized plate has been increased by 52.6%. \nTo study the effect of laminate stacking sequence on the buckling load of a stiffened plate, \na composite skin panel stiffened by five T-shape stiffeners was investigated. In this case, the \nmaterials of the plate remain the same as the above unstiffened plate. In the initial design, the \nlaminate of the skin panel is made of 52 plies and the stiffeners made of 60 plies. The height of \nthe stiffener blade is 78 mm. In the optimization, only the stacking sequence of the skin \nlaminate was selected as design variables within the optional ply stacks. While the geometry of \nthe stiffened panel remains the same as the initial design. The optimization results of the \nstiffened skin panel were listed in Table 4 to compare with the initial design. \n \nTable 4. Optimization result of the stiffened skin panel \nDesign cases Stacking sequence Buckling load (105N) \nInitial skin design [(\u00b145\/02\/902)4\/\u00b145]s 37.52 \nOptimal skin design [(902)2\/(02)2\/902\/(02)2\/(\u00b145)6]s     37.65 \n \nCompared with Table 3, the results shown in Table 4 indicate that the stacking sequence \noptimization of a stiffened skin panel is much less effective for improving buckling load than \nan unstiffened plate. In this case, an improvement of buckling load by only 0.35% has been \nachieved for the stiffened skin panel. \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 13\n4.3 Geometry optimization of the stiffeners of the stiffened panel \n \nAs studied in the last section, it is noted that the stacking sequence optimization may \nsignificantly improve the buckling capability of a laminate plate. For a stiffened laminate panel \nhowever, little improvement of buckling capability was obtained by optimizing the skin \nlaminate stacking sequence. In this current section, the geometry of stiffeners is included in the \ndesign variables. Two optimization cases are considered under the constant weight condition. In \nthe first case, only the height and thickness of the stiffeners blade were varied without altering \nthe skin panel and the stiffener flange. In the second case, the skin panel thickness was also \nincluded in the design variables. Table 5 shows the results of the two optimization cases in \ncomparison with the original design. \n \nTable 5.

The buckling load has \nbeen increased by 60.56% in case 1 with the height of blade increased from the original design \n(104.91 vs 78). In the second case, the buckling load has a greater increase by 170.56% from \nthe original design. In this case, the ply number of the skin is reduced from 52 to 48 as the \nheight of the blade increased from 78 to 117.04. It means 7.62% of the mass of the stiffened \nplate was moved from the skin to the stiffeners without weight penalty. \nFrom the discussion above, we can draw a conclusion that the optimization of stiffeners is \nmuch effective to improve the stiffened panel against buckling. From structural point of view, \nthe materials in the stiffeners are much more efficient than the skin in terms of the buckling \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 14\nstability of the stiffened panel. Therefore in the design of a stiffened panel against buckling, \nmain attention should be paid to the stiffeners design.  \n \n4.4 Optimization of the panel with different number of stiffeners \n \nIn addition to the optimization of the skin layup and stiffeners geometry, the effect of \nnumber of stiffeners on the buckling of the stiffened panel was also investigated. A Matlab \nprogram based on the MCLACA was developed and used. This program also employs the \nESDU03001 code as a subroutine for buckling analysis and the MCLACA for optimizing the \nstiffener and skin laminate thickness. The laminate layup of the stiffeners flange and blade was \nkept identical. While the geometry and number of stiffeners was varied in the optimization \nwithout changing the total weight of the stiffened panel. Ten different numbers of stiffeners \nwere considered. The cases with and without the ply contiguous constraint were studied and \ncompared. Since the total length of the string is 40, the total number of city-layer in MCLACA \nis set to be 40. According to the literature [18], the other parameters chosen in the MCLACA \nare shown in Table 6. \nTable 6. Parameters chosen in the optimization using MCLACA \nParameter  \u03b1\n 0q\n \n\u03be\n \n\u03b5\n \n\u03c1\n \n0\u03c4\n \nN\n \nValue 0.5 0.8 0.8 0.4 0.6 0.1 40 \n    \nTable 7 shows the results of the optimum laminate thickness of the skin and stiffeners with \ndifferent number of stiffeners. It is obvious that as the number of stiffeners increases, the \nthickness of the skin and stiffeners decreases to maintain the total weight of the panel. As \nshown in Fig.7, the mass ratio of the skin to the stiffened panel reduces from 65.63% to 43.75% \nas the number of stiffeners increases from 4 to 13. It indicates that the material used in \nstiffeners is more efficient than used in skin for improving buckling. \n \nTable 7.

The results show that the maximum buckling load of the panel without the \nply contiguous constraint is greater than that with the ply contiguous constraint. It is also noted \nthat the influence of ply contiguous on the buckling load becomes smaller as the number of \nstiffeners increases. This is because the thickness, hence the laminate layup variation of the skin \nand stiffeners becomes smaller.  \nAs shown in Fig.8, when the number of stiffeners is increased from 4 to 13, the buckling \nload increases from 80.52 to 205.78 with the ply contiguous constraint and from 107.71 to \n207.59 without the ply contiguous constraint. It is shown that the maximum buckling load of a \ncomposite stiffened panel can be increased significantly with an optimum number of stiffeners \nwithout weight penalty. As shown in Fig.8, when the number of stiffeners was increased from 4 \nto 5, the skin thickness remained the same, but the maximum buckling load was increased \nsignificantly, especially for the case with the ply contiguous constraint. When the number of \nstiffeners increased up to 9, the maximum buckling load of the stiffened panel kept increasing \nat a high rate. However the increase slowed down and converged to a value when the number is \nbeyond 9. In this particular case, it seems that 9 stiffeners provide an optimum solution. In \npractice, the number of the stiffeners is limited by the overall structure configuration, assembly \nand manufacture consideration. \nInstead of optimizing the geometry and laminate layup of the skin and stiffeners separately, \nstudy was also carried out by optimizing all the design variables simultaneously by using the \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 16\nMCLACA.

The design variables \ninclude the geometry and laminate layup of the skin and stiffeners with the ply contiguous \nconstraint. A modified ant colony algorithm called MCLACA was presented and applied to \noptimize the plate and stiffened panel. It is proved that this optimization method combined with \nthe ESDU-a0301 program for buckling calculation is a very efficient design tool in the \napplication. From the study results, the following conclusions can be drawn. For a composite \nplate, the maximum buckling load can be increased significantly by optimizing the laminate \nstacking sequence without weight penalty. For a stiffened panel, the effect of skin and stiffener \nlaminate layup on the overall buckling is much smaller than the stiffeners geometry, especially \nthe blade height. In addition, the number of stiffeners of the panel has the largest influence on \nthe buckling load of the panel. The maximum buckling load of the stiffened panel increases \nwith the number of stiffeners without weight penalty and converge to a value. Without the ply \ncontiguous constraint, the maximum buckling load of the optimized panel is normally greater \nthan that with the ply contiguous constraint. The proposed MCLACA can also be applied to the \ncase of optimizing the geometry and laminate layup of the skin and stiffeners of a stiffened \npanel simultaneously for the maximum buckling load under a weight constraint. \n \nReference  \n[1] Nagendra S, Jestin D, Guradal Z, Haftka RT, Watson LT.
