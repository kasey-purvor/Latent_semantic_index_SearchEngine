Introduction \nFor many different types of materials, excimer laser radiation has been shown to be a viable means \nfor transforming the surface properties of materials so as to bring about improvements to their \nwettability characteristics. Such materials include aluminium (Zhou & DeHosson 1993; 1994) and \nother metals (Heitz et al. 1992; Henari & Blau 1995; Olfert et al. 1996) coated with various ceramics, \npolymer materials like polyethylene terephthalate (PET) (Andrew et al. 1983; Watanabe et al. 1993), \npolyparaphenylene terephthalamide (PPTA) (Watanabe & Takata 1994) and polyether-etherketon \n(PEEK) (Laurens et al. 1998; 2000) and even textile fibres (Bahners 1993; Bahners et al. 1993). \nComprehensive and detailed investigations by Song & Netravali (1998; 1998\n1\n; 1999) into the effects \nof excimer laser radiation on the interfacial characteristics of UHSPE fibres and epoxy resin revealed \na considerable increase in the interfacial shear strength resulted after laser treatment. The \nconsiderable amount work conducted by Lawrence and Li is meaningful insofar as it demonstrates \nthe practicability of employing different types of lasers to effect changes in the wettability \ncharacteristics of ceramics (1998; 1999; 1999\n1\n) metals (1999\n2\n; 2000) and polymers (2001) for \nimproved adhesion and bonding. Moreover, Lawrence recently identified the reasons for the changes \nin the wetting characteristics after laser surface treatment with regard to changes in the material\u2019s \nsurface topography, surface composition and surface energy for ceramics (2002) and metals (2002\n1\n). \nThis paper examines the interfacial bonding and adhesion characteristics of a number of liquid-metals \non the untreated and high power diode laser (HPDL) treated surface of a alumina bioceramic in \nelectronic terms. Furthermore, this investigation will provide valuable insight and permit a fuller \nunderstanding of the adhesion and bonding mechanisms active in the alumina bioceramic, especially \nthe alterations to these mechanisms after HPDL treatment. \nSome time ago McDonald & Eberhart (1965) proposed that there were two different surface sites for \nbonding metal atoms of liquid transition metals with Al2O3. The first type took the form of van der \nWaals interactions between the metal atoms and the O\n2-\n anions present on the Al2O3 surface. The \nsecond type involves the metal\/O2 chemical bonds whose energy was assumed to be proportional to \nthe free energy of the metal oxide formation. Consequently the work of adhesion can be expressed as \nthe sum of these two bonding energies. Work by Chatain et al. (1986) elaborated further and found \nthat it was necessary to take into account the metal\/Al chemical interactions along with the metal\/O2 \nreactions. Indeed, this approach yielded good agreement with an empirical equation comprising bulk \n 4 \nthermodynamic quantities of both metal\/O2 and metal\/Al2O3 bonds. Although these approaches are \nundoubtedly useful, Stoneham & Tasker (1985) maintain that many phenomena associated with \nmetal\/non-metal interfaces with large dielectric constant mismatch can be explained in terms of the \nimage interactions. More particularly, it was stated that the chief contributor to adhesion between \nnon-reactive metals and oxides is the electrostatic interaction between ionic charges in the oxide and \nthe induced image charges in the metal. This notion was substantiated theoretically by Johnson & \nPepper (1982) who showed that, for transition metals in contact with sapphire, the primary interaction \noccurred between the metal atoms and the O\n2-\n anions present on the sapphire surface and was \nessentially covalent. Further, Hicter et al. (1988) suggested that the adhesion between a non-reactive \nmetal and Al2O3 was brought about through electron transfer from the metal into the Al2O3 \nconduction band which was assumed be initially empty. Using an electronic approach, an \nencompassing and comprehensive study by Li (1992) found that the work of adhesion of non-reactive \nliquid-metals with transition metal carbides was a simultaneous function of the valence electron \nconcentrations of both metal and carbide. In the same way, the work of adhesion of different metals \non TiC was found to increase linearly with increasing electron density at the boundary of the Wigner-\nSeitz cell of the corresponding metals. At the same time, the work of adhesion of Cu on a number of \ntransition metal carbides was seen to increase with decreasing thermodynamic stability of the \ncarbides. From this work it was concluded that the interactions between a metal and a carbide are \nbasically metallic in nature, resulting from the overlapping of the valence electrons at the \nmetal\/carbide interface. What is more, Li (1992\n1\n) extended this approach to reveal that this \ndependency of the work of adhesion on the electron density of the liquid-metal and the \nthermodynamic stability of the solid compound was the case for various liquid-metal\/solid-\nionocovalent oxides. \n2. Experimental procedures \n2.1. Alumina bioceramic specifications \nThe alumina bioceramic studied in this work was alpha-alumina which is typically used for hip ball & \ncup replacements. For the purpose of experimental convenience the alpha-alumina was fabricated \ninto blocks (25 x 25 x 5 mm\n3\n) prior to laser treatment. The alpha-alumina used was 99.4% pure Al2O3 \nwith impurities of CaO, Fe2O3, K2O, MgO, Na2O, SiO2 and TiO2 constituting the remaining 0.6%. In \norder to carry out analytical analyses of the untreated and HPDL treated specimens, they were \n 5 \nsectioned with a cutting machine (Struers, Ltd.) using a diamond rimmed cutting blade and examined \nusing optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy disperse X-ray analysis \n(EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. \n2.2. High power diode laser processing procedures \nThe HPDL (Rofin-Sinar GmbH DL 020 S) used in this work emitted a high order mode beam at 808 \n\u00b110 nm and was operated in the CW mode with optical powers ranging from 40-120 W. A schematic \nillustration of the laser processing experimental arrangement is given in Figure 1. The HPDL beam \nwas delivered to the work area by means of an optical fibre 10 m long and of 1500 \u00b5m core diameter. \nThe end of the fibre was connected to a focusing lens assembly with a focal length of 42 mm and was \nmounted on the z-axis of a 3-axis CNC gantry table. This arrangement produced a defocused HPDL \nbeam with a spot diameter of 2.5 mm. The alumina bioceramic was irradiated with the HPDL beam \nby traversing the samples beneath the beam using the x- and y-axis of the CNC gantry table at a speed \nof 360 - 480 mm\/min with an O2 process gas being coaxially blown at a rate of 3 l\/min. \n2.3. Wettability and bonding characteristics analysis procedures \nTo examine the wetting and surface energy characteristics of the alumina bioceramic, and hence \nquantify any surface energy changes in the material resulting from HPDL interaction, a series of \ncontrol experiments were carried out using the sessile drop technique with a variety of liquids with \nknown surface energy properties. The control test liquids were: human blood; human blood plasma; \nglycerol and 4-octanol. This particular test liquid series was selected as it has been shown in previous \nstudies (Agathopoulos & Nikolopoulos 1995; Lawrence & Li 1999; 2001) to be most suitable for \nceramic materials. The experiments were conducted in normal atmospheric conditions at a \ntemperature of 20\n0\nC \u00b120C with the temperature of the liquids themselves throughout the experiments \nalso being maintained at around 20\n0\nC. The droplets were released onto the surface of the test alumina \nbioceramic (HPDL treated and untreated) from the tip of a micropipette, with the resultant volume of \nthe drops being approximately 6 x 10\n-3\n cm\n3\n. Each experiment lasted for three minutes with profile \nphotographs of the sessile drops being obtained every minute and the contact angle, \u03b8, subsequently \nbeing measured. The standard deviation due to experimental error was calculated as being \u00b10.20. \nTo obtain a fuller appreciation of the adhesion and bonding mechanisms active in the alumina \nbioceramic, before and after HPDL treatment, wettability experiments were conducted using selected \n 6 \nliquid-metals. In this way it was possible to examine the adhesion and bonding characteristics from \nan electronic stand point. The metals chosen were: Al; Cu; Fe; Mn; Pb and Sn and were supplied in \ncubes of 3 x 3 x 3 mm\n3\n. The metals were selected on account of the fact that full details of their \nsurface energy characteristics. The experiments were completed by placing a cube of each metal on \nthe untreated and HPDL treated surface of the alumina bioceramic samples. The samples were then \nplaced in turn inside a vacuum furnace whereupon each sample was heated to the various melting \ntemperatures of the metals at a rate of 75\n0\nC\/min in a vacuum of 2 x 10\n-5\n torr. At the appropriate time \nthe liquid-metal sessile drops were photographed through the glass window of the furnace every \nminute for three minutes. The sessile drop photographs were subsequently analysed to obtain a value \nfor \u03b8. The standard deviation due to experimental error was calculated as being \u00b10.40. \n3. Wetting and the work of adhesion at the liquid-metal\/ceramic interface \nIn practice, for wetting to occur, \u03b8, must be less than 900, otherwise if \u03b8 is greater than 900 then the \nliquid does not wet the solid and no adhesion occurs (Fowkes 1964). When a drop of liquid is \nbrought into contact with a flat solid surface, the final shape taken by the drop, and thus whether it \nwill wet the surface or not, depends upon the relative magnitudes of the molecular forces that exist \nwithin the liquid (cohesive) and between the liquid and the solid (adhesive) (Fowkes 1964). The \nindex of this effect is \u03b8 and it is related to the solid and liquid surface energies, \u03b3sv and \u03b3lv, and the \nsolid-liquid interfacial energy \u03b3sl, through the principle of virtual work expressed by the rearranged \nYoung\u2019s equation: \n   cos\u03b8\n\u03b3 \u03b3\n\u03b3\n=\n\u2212sv sl\nlv\n (1) \nClearly, to achieve wetting \u03b3sv should be large, while \u03b3sl and \u03b3lv should be small. Hence liquids of a \nlower surface tension will always spread over a solid surface of higher surface tension in order to \nreduce the total free-energy of the system (Zisman 1964). This is on account of the fact that the \nmolecular adhesion between solid and liquid is greater than the cohesion between the molecules of \nthe liquid (Fowkes 1964). \nIn fundamental terms, the driving force for the formation of a liquid-metal\/ceramic interface is the \nenergy relinquished when the intimate contact between the metal and the ceramic is formed. This \n 7 \ndriving force is usually characterised by the adhesion energy. The adhesion energy, or work of \nadhesion, Wad, is defined as the work per unit area which needs to be provided to separate reversibly a \nsolid\/liquid interface so as to create distinct solid\/vapour and liquid\/vapour interfaces. Thus \n   sllvsvadW \u03b3\u03b3\u03b3 \u2212+=  (2) \nIf one takes into account Young\u2019s equation then Equation (1) can be rearranged to form the Young-\nDupre equation. Thus the Wad can be expressed as \n   ( )Wad lv= +\u03b3 \u03b81 cos  (3) \nIn this way experimental values of Wad can be determined from the \u03b3lv value of the liquid and the \nvalue of \u03b8 produced when the liquid is in contact with the solid.  \nGenerally the value of Wad in metal\/ceramic systems can be expressed as the sum of the different \ncontributions of the interfacial interactions between two phases: \n   equilnonequilad WWW \u2212+=  (4) \nwhere Wnon-equil denotes the non-equilibrium contribution to the work of adhesion when a chemical \nreaction takes place at the metal\/ceramic interface, while Wequil represents the equilibrium \ncontribution which corresponds to non-reactive systems. This contribution can be further divided into \ntwo separate terms: Wchem-equil, which is the cohesive energy between the two contacting phases that \nresults from the establishment of chemical equilibrium bonds achieved by the mutual saturation of \nthe free valences of the contacting surfaces and WVDW, which signifies the van der Waals interaction \nor dispersion forces. As such, Equation (4) becomes \n   equilnonVDWequilchemad WWWW \u2212\u2212 ++=  (4a) \n4. Analysis of the wetting and bonding characteristics  \n4.1. High power diode laser interaction with the alumina bioceramic and the effects thereof on \nwettability characteristics \nIn order to investigate accurately the bonding characteristics of the alumina bioceramic, both before \nand after HPDL surface treatment, it is essential that consideration is given to the wettability \ncharacteristics changes that are effected by HPDL interaction. Using a selected control test liquid \n 8 \nseries it can be seen from Table 1 that interaction of the alumina bioceramic with the HPDL beam \nresulted in the \u03b8 between the alumina bioceramic and the control test liquids reducing appreciably, \nimplying that marked changes in the wettability characteristics have been realised. Previous studies \nhave shown that such laser-induced changes in the wettability characteristics of ceramics are due to \nchanges in three factors: the surface roughness; the surface O2 content and the surface energy \n(Lawrence 2002). \n4.1.1. Surface roughness \nIrregularities on the surface of a material that cause roughness generally take the form of grooves. \nRough grooves on a surface can be categorised as either radial or circular grooves. In practical terms, \nany rough surface can be represented by a combination of these two cases (Zhou &DeHosson 1995), \nwith two roughness parameters being defined as the Wenzel type, DR (Wenzel 1936) and the \nCassie\/Baxter type, FR (Cassie & Baxter 1944). In the case that wetting spreads radially, as is the \nlikely case with the alumina bioceramic, then the resulting radial contact angle, \u03b8rad, is related to the \ntheoretical contact angle, \u03b8th, by \n ( )cos cos\u03b8 \u03b8rad R R th RD F F= \u2212 \u22121  (14) \nAccording to Neumann (1974), only if FR is equal to zero, then a model similar to that for \nheterogeneous solid surfaces can be developed in order to account for surface irregularities, being \ngiven by a rearrangement of Wenzel\u2019s equation: \n     \u03b3 \u03b3\n\u03b3 \u03b8\nsl sv\nlv w\nr\n= \u2212\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f7\ncos\n (15) \nwhere, r is the roughness factor defined as the ratio of the real and apparent surface areas and \u03b8w is \nthe contact angle for the wetting of a rough surface. It is important to note that Wenzel\u2019s treatment is \nonly effective at the position of wetting triple line (Zhou & DeHosson 1995). Nonetheless, it is \nevident from Equation (15) that if the roughness factor, r, is large, that is the solid surface is smooth, \nthen \u03b3sl will become small, thus, a reduction in the contact angle will be inherently realised by the \nliquid if \u03b8w<900. Conversely, if \u03b8w>900 then the opposite will be observed. Although other, more \nsophisticated approaches may be taken to examine the effects of surface roughness on wetting \n(Palasantzas & DeHosson 2001), for this present study the use of Equation (15) is quite sufficient. \n 9 \nReductions in the surface roughness of the alumina bioceramic were observed (using a Taylor-\nHobson Surtronic 3+ profileometer) after interaction with the HPDL beam (see Table 1). Similar \nresults were obtained by Nicolas et al. (1997), who observed that excimer laser treatment of a ZrO2 \nceramic resulted in a smoother surface and Feng et al. (1998), who noted that \u03b8 was inversely \nproportional to surface roughness.  \n4.1.2. Surface O2 contact \nThe O2 content of a material\u2019s surface is an influential factor governing the wetting performance of \nthe material; where an increase will inherently produce a reduction in \u03b8 , and vice versa (Ueki et al. \n1986; Li 1993). Now, wetting is governed by the first atomic layers of the surface of a material, so to \ndetermine the element content of O2 at the surface of the alumina bioceramic, it was necessary to \nexamine the surface using XPS. The results of the XPS analysis of the alumina bioceramic in terms \nof the surface O2 content are given in Table 1.  \n4.1.3. Surface energy \nSurface energy, \u03b3, arises from a variety of intermolecular forces whose contribution to the total \nsurface energy is additive (Fowkes 1964). The majority of these forces are functions of the particular \nchemical nature of a certain material, and as such the total surface energy comprises of \u03b3p (polar or \nnon-dispersive interaction) and \u03b3d (dispersive component; since van der Waals forces are present in \nall systems regardless of their chemical nature). Therefore, the surface energy of any system can be \ndescribed by (Fowkes 1964) \n \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3= +d p  (16) \nLikewise, Wad can be expressed as the sum of the different intermolecular forces that act at the \ninterface (Fowkes 1964): \n ( ) ( )W W Wad add adp svd lvd svp lvp= + = +2 2\n1 2 1 2\n\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3\n\/ \/\n (17) \nBy equating Equation (17) with Equation (2), \u03b8 for solid\/liquid systems can be related to the surface \nenergies of the respective liquid and solid by \n \n( ) ( )\ncos\n\/ \/\n\u03b8\n\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3\n\u03b3\n=\n+\n\u2212\n2 2\n1\n1 2 1 2\nsv\nd\nlv\nd\nsv\np\nlv\np\nlv\n (18) \n 10 \nFowkes (1964) has stated that \u03b3 sv\nd\n can be estimated by using Equation (18) and plotting the graph of \ncos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)\n1\/2\n\/\u03b3lv (see Figure 2). Hence the value of \u03b3 sv\nd\n is estimated by the gradient \n(=2(\u03b3 sv\nd\n)\n1\/2\n) of the line which connects the origin (cos \u03b8 = -1) with the intercept point of the straight \nline (cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)\n1\/2\n\/\u03b3lv) correlating the data point with the abscissa at cos \u03b8 = 1.  \nIt is not possible to determine the value of the polar component of the alumina bioceramic surface \nenergy directly from Figure 2 since the intercept of the straight line (cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)\n1\/2\n\/\u03b3lv) being \nat ( )2 1 2\u03b3 \u03b3svp lvp\n\/\n\/\u03b3lv and as such, only referring to individual control liquids and not the control liquid \nsystem as a whole. Having said that, it has been established that the entire amount of the surface \nenergies owing to dispersion forces of either the solids or the liquids are active in the wettability \nperformance (Fowkes 1964; Good & Girifalco 1960). Therefore it is possible to calculate the \ndispersive component of the work of adhesion from Equation (17). The results reveal that for each \nparticular control liquid in contact with both the untreated and HPDL treated alumina bioceramic \nsurfaces, Wad  can be correlated with Wad\nd\n by the relationship \n W aW bad ad\nd= +  (19) \nAlso, for the control test liquids used, a linear relationship between the dispersive and polar \ncomponents of the control test liquids surface energies has been deduced which satisfies the equation \n  ( ) ( ) 15.145.0 2\/12\/1 += dlvplv \u03b3\u03b3  (20) \nBy introducing Equation (19) into Equation (17) and rearranging, then \n       ( )W a W badp add= \u2212 +1  (21) \nor \n              ( ) ( ) ( )( ) ( )\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3svp lvp svd lvda\nb1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2\n1\n2\n\/ \/ \/ \/\n= \u2212 +  (22) \nWhat is more, by introducing Equation (20) into Equation (22) and differentiating with respect to \n( )\u03b3 lvd\n1 2\/\n, considering that ( )\u03b3 svd\n1 2\/\n and ( )\u03b3 svp\n1 2\/\nare constant, then the following is valid: \n 11 \n                         ( ) ( )\n( )\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\nsv\np sv\nd a1 2\n1 2\n1\n0 45\n\/\n\/\n.\n=\n\u2212\n (23) \nNow, the value of a for the untreated and HPDL treated alumina bioceramic can be determined from \na plot of Equation (19) (0.74 and 1.26 respectively) and \u03b3 sv\nd\n has already been determined for the \nuntreated and HPDL treated alumina bioceramic from Figure 2. As such it is possible to calculate \n\u03b3 sv\np\n for untreated and HPDL treated alumina bioceramic by simply using Equation (23). \nIt is evident from Table 1 that the HPDL melting of the surface of the alumina bioceramic leads to a \nreduction in the total surface energy whilst increasing \u03b3 sv\np\n, thereby improving the action of wetting \nand adhesion. Such changes in the surface energy of the alumina bioceramic after HPDL melting are \ndue to the fact partial vitrification of the surface is occasioned, a transition that is known to bring \nabout an increase in \u03b3 sv\np\n (Lawrence et al. 1998).  \nIt is important to realise at this point that owing to the long range ionic interactions in the alumina \nbioceramic and the composite nature of the interfaces between the alumina bioceramic and the \ncontrol test liquids, it is probable that the thermodynamically defined total solid surface energy, as \ndefined in Equation (16), will be higher than the sum of the \u03b3d and \u03b3p components of the surface \nenergy. Indeed, the derivations that lead to Equation (18) can only be done under the specific \nassumption that the ionisation potentials are all equal and that dipole-dipole random orientation \ninteractions dominate over dipole-induced dipole random interactions. Still, the increase in (excess) \nsurface free energy will doubtless be less then the increase in the total lattice energy. On the other \nhand, an absorbed liquid layer may shield the ionic fields substantially. Consequently, all the data \nderived from Equations (16) - (23) should be considered as being semi-empirical. Nevertheless, as the \nstudies by Agathopoulos & Nikolopoulos (1995) and Lawrence (1999; 2001; 2002) found, it is \nreasonable to conclude from the data obtained from Equations (16) - (23) that HPDL treatment of the \nalumina bioceramic has caused an increase \u03b3p . \n4.2. The bonding characteristics between the high power diode laser treated alumina \nbioceramic and the selected liquid-metals \nWhen two dissimilar materials are brought into contact, complex combinations of a range of bonding \nmechanisms actually occur, varying according to the types of materials used (Greenhut 1991). For \n 12 \nmost materials in intimate contact with the alumina bioceramic, the mechanisms active will \nprincipally involve physical bonding (van der Waals forces), chemical bonding and electronic \nreactions (Greenhut 1991). In the particular case of the alumina bioceramic, the primary bonding \nmechanism active will be physical. This is because adhesion between many materials is assured by \nelectron transfer and is therefore related to bandgap energy (Li 1995). Thus, for non-conducting \nmaterials with large bandgaps such as the alumina bioceramic, there will be very few free charges \ninside the ceramic crystals, even at elevated temperatures. In this case the electron transfer at the \ninterface will be minimal as the electron transfer depends exclusively on the concentration of free \ncharges in the ceramic crystal (Li 1995). As a result, WVDW will be the major contributor to Wad in \nEquation (4(a)). Even so, evidence of the action of bonding mechanisms other than van der Waals \nforces has been observed in previous studies.  \nA direct indication of the energetical interactions that take place between the solid and liquid phases \nof such materials when in contact can be gleaned from Wad; with increases denoting stronger \ninteractions. As Table 2 shows, from measurements of \u03b8 for selected liquid-metals in contact with the \nsurface of the alumina bioceramic, it was possible to calculate the corresponding value of Wad using \nEquation (3). These Wad values are plotted as a function of the electron density, nw-s, at the boundary \nof the Wigner-Seitz cell of the corresponding metals in Figure 3. As can be seen from Figure 3, a \ngeneral increase in Wad between the alumina bioceramic and the selected liquid-metals has been \noccasioned after HPDL treatment. Since metal-oxide interactions are assured by electron transfer at \nthe metal\/oxide interface, then it would appear from Figure 3 that such an increase has resulted from \nHPDL interaction. The intensity of the electron transfer at the interface depends on the electron \ndensity of the metal on the one hand, and on the concentration of the holes in the valence band of the \noxide on the other. So if the oxide type is set and the liquid-metals in contact with it are changed, \nthen the intensity of the electron transfer at the interface would exclusively be a function of the \nelectron density of the liquid-metals and would increase accordingly with the electron density of the \nmetals. This occurrence is borne out somewhat by the linear relationship seen between Wad for the \nselected liquid-metals with the alumina bioceramic (untreated and HPDL treated) on the electron \ndensity at the boundary of the Wigner-Seitz cell of the corresponding metals. Similarly, if one \nconsiders Equation (24), which shows the relationship between the concentration of holes in the \nvalence band (which is equal to the number of electrons in the conduction band) for an ideal pure \noxide crystal, C, and the bandgap energy, Eg \n 13 \n   \uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb \u2212\n=\nKT\nE\nCC\ng\no\n2\nexp    (24) \nwhere and Co is a constant, K is Boltzmann\u2019s constant and T is temperature, then it can be seen that \nthe concentration of holes in the valence band increases with a decrease in the bandgap energy. \nAccordingly, the intensity of electron transfer at the liquid-metal\/oxide interface increases with \ndecreasing bandgap energy of the oxide. Thus it is possible to say that Wad of any given liquid-metal \non an oxide will increase, with \u03b8 decreasing accordingly due to Equation (3), with a decrease in the \nbandgap energy of the oxide. This being the case, it is reasonable to maintain that Figure 3 implies \nthat HPDL interaction with the alumina bioceramic has brought into being a surface with a reduced \nbandgap energy since Wad has evidently increased after HPDL treatment, whilst at the same time a \nreduction in \u03b8 has been realised (see Table 2).  \nFindings by Vijh (1970) revealed a linear correlation between the bandgap energy of a number of \ndifferent oxides and the ratio ri\/rm of the ionic radius, ri, to the metallic radius, rm, of certain oxide \nmetals. Based on the above discussions it is likely that a correlation between the wetting properties of \nthe oxide metals and the ratio ri\/rm exists. Indeed, the ionicity of a binary solid has been defined in \nterms of the electronegativity of the two components making up the solid, with the values of these \nelectronegativities being derived from the excess bond energy above the purely covalent component \n(Vijh 1970; Li 1992\n1\n). Clearly, if there is a correlation between bandgaps and bond energies, and if \nthe electronegativities are derived from bond energies, then it follows that there is a correlation \nbetween bandgaps and electronegativities. With this rationale a correlation between wettability and \nionicity is quite conceivable. Thus it can be assumed that as the ionicity of a ceramic increases, the \nmaterial\u2019s propensity to wet will decease and vice versa. The observed increase in Wad in Figure 3 \nand the corresponding decrease in \u03b8 recorded in Table 2 after HPDL of the alumina bioceramic \nappear to support this assumption. It is, therefore, highly probable that the surface of the alumina \nbioceramic produced by HPDL interaction will be less ionic in nature than the untreated surface and \nwill in turn have increased wettability characteristics. \n5. Conclusions \nHigh power diode laser (HPDL)-induced changes in the wettability characteristics of an alumina \nbioceramic are effected as a result of: (i) an ideal level of melting and resolidification being induced \n 14 \nwhich in turn causes a reduction in the surface roughness, thereby directly reducing the contact angle, \n\u03b8, (ii) an increase in the surface O2 content of the alumina bioceramic after HPDL treatment which \nintrinsically brings about a decrease in \u03b8 and (iii) the increase in the polar component of the surface \nenergy, \u03b3 sv\np\n, of the alumina bioceramic resulting from the HPDL induced surface melting and \nresolidification which consequently creates a more polar partially vitrified microstructure.  \nFrom an electronic perspective, the bonding characteristics of the alumina bioceramic before and \nafter HPDL treatment were determined from wettability experiments carried out with selected liquid-\nmetals. It was found that HPDL surface treatment yielded an overall increase in the work of adhesion, \nWad, and a corresponding reduction in \u03b8, between the alumina bioceramic and the selected liquid-\nmetals. It is believed that this observed increase in Wad and the matching reduction in \u03b8 resulted from \nthe HPDL induced changes to the alumina bioceramic creating a surface with a reduced bandgap \nenergy, which is significant, for metal-oxide interactions are assured by electron transfer at the \nmetal\/oxide interface. In addition, correlations between bandgaps and bond energies, and in turn \nbandgaps and electronegativities mean that a correlation between the wettability and ionicity of the \nalumina bioceramic is certainly possible, with increases in the ionicity of the alumina bioceramic \nleading to a decreased disposition to wet. Based on this notion it is asserted that the observed increase \nin Wad and the corresponding decrease in \u03b8 of the alumina bioceramic after HPDL is due to the \nsurface being less ionic in nature than the untreated surface, thereby inherently increasing the \nwettability characteristics. \n 15 \nReferences \nAgathopoulos, S. & Nikolopoulos, P. 1995 J. of Biomed.
