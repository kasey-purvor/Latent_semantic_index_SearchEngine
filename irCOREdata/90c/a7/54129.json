INTRODUCTION \nIGMA delta modulation technique has been proposed and \napplied in analog-to-digital (A\/D) and digital-to-analog \n(D\/A) conversion for many years [1]. It is particularly popular \nin the past few years because of the advance in electronic \ntechnology that makes the devices practical with low \nimplementation cost [2]. Since SDMs can achieve very high \nSNRs, it is widely applied in many systems required A\/D and \nD\/A conversions, such as in the consumer and professional \naudio processing systems [2], communication systems [3], and \nprecision measurement devices [4]. \n In order to improve the SNR, high order SDMs are \npreferred. However, high order SDMs suffer from instability \nproblems. Although there are many existing linear control \nManuscript received February 12, 2005; revised June 16, 2005.

Since the loop filter is usually \ndesigned to have a very high SNR, it is not guaranteed that the \nSNR of the controlled SDMs is still maintained or even \nimproved if the effective poles of the loop filter are changed. \nMoreover, the parameters in the controller depend on the loop \nfilter parameters, so it is not guaranteed that a particular class \nof controllers can stabilize all types of interpolative SDMs. \nFurthermore, the controlled SDMs may still be unstable when \nthe magnitude of the input signal is increased. In addition, it \ncannot be guaranteed that the controlled SDMs are stable for \nall initial conditions in the state space. \nIn order to control the SDMs without changing the effective \npoles of the loop filter, nonlinear control strategy, such as the \nclipping control strategy, was employed [2]. For the clipping \ncontrol strategy, as the state variables are always reset to the \nsame values, periodic output sequences may result and this \nperiodic behavior is known as limit cycle behavior. This \nsituation is found very frequently when the input signal is very \nslow time varying or the clipped level is set at very low value. \nFor audio applications [2], the occurrence of limit cycle \nbehaviors results to the annoying audio tones, which should \nbe avoided. Besides, there may be a large jump between the \nunclipped and clipped state levels. As a result, audio clicks \nmay be observed, which should also be avoided. Furthermore, \nas the set of the state vectors under the clipping control \nstrategy is usually not the same as the invariant set, the \nclipping force may be applied very frequently. \nIn order to solve these problems, an impulsive control \nstrategy is proposed in this paper, in which it is to reset the \nstate vectors to different positions in the state space whenever \nthe control force is applied. Hence, the occurrence of limit \ncycle behaviors and the effect of audio clicks can be \nminimized with the guarantee of the bounded state variables. \nMoreover, if the invariant set exists, then we only need to \nreset the state variables of the loop filter once and the state \nvectors of the SDMs are guaranteed to be within the invariant \nset forever if the effects of limit cycle behaviors and audio \nclicks do not consider. However, there are usually an infinite \nnumber of state vectors in the invariant set, this paper is to \ndetermine the state vectors that the impulsive controller resets \nto. Since the SDMs consist of a quantizer, nonlinear \nFuzzy Impulsive Control of High Order \nInterpolative Lowpass Sigma Delta Modulators \nCharlotte Yuk-Fan Ho P1 P, Student Member, IEEE, Bingo Wing-Kuen LingP2 P and Joshua D.

In Section II, we \nintroduce the notations which appear throughout this paper. In \nSection III, the conditions for the occurrence of limit cycle \nbehaviors and the local stability criterion of the SDMs are \nderived, which are used for the formulation of fuzzy \nmembership functions and fuzzy impulsive control law. In \nSection IV, a fuzzy impulsive control strategy is proposed. In \nSection V, some simulation results are presented to illustrate \nthe effectiveness of the fuzzy impulsive control strategy. \nFinally, a conclusion is summarized in Section VI. \nII. NOTATIONS \nThe block diagram of an interpolative SDM is shown in \nFigure 1. The input to the SDM and the output of the loop \nfilter are denoted as, respectively, ( )ku  and ( )ky . We assume \nthat the loop filter is a single input single output real system \nand the input is also real, that is, ( ) \u211c\u2208ku , so ( ) \u211c\u2208ky . The \ntransfer function of the loop filter is denoted as ( )zF . ( )zF  is \nassumed to be causal, rational and proper with the order of the \npolynomial of 1\u2212z  in the numerator being equal to that in the \ndenominator and there is a delay in the numerator. We make \nthose assumptions because this type of SDMs is commonly \nused in the industry [2]. Denote the coefficients in the \ndenominator and numerator of ( )zF  as, respectively, ia  for \nNi ,,1,0 L=  and jb  for Nj ,,1 L= , where N  is the order of \nthe loop filter. Then \n( )\n\u2211\n\u2211\n=\n\u2212\n=\n\u2212\n= N\ni\ni\ni\nN\nj\nj\nj\nza\nzb\nzF\n0\n1 . (1) \nSince this paper is based on the feedforward structure of the \nSDMs, without loss of generality, we assume that the loop \nfilter is realized via the direct form because the expressions \nwill be much simplified. For other minimal realizations, they \ncan be converted to the direct form realization using simple \ntransformations. Hence, the SDMs can be described by the \nfollowing state space equation: \n( ) ( ) ( ) ( )( )kkkk suBAxx \u2212+=+1  (2) \nfor 0\u2265k , where \n( ) ( ) ( )[ ] ( ) ( )[ ]TTN kyNkykxkxk 1,,,,1 \u2212\u2212\u2261\u2261 LLx  (3) \nis the state vector of the SDMs, \n( ) ( ) ( )[ ]TkuNkuk 1,, \u2212\u2212\u2261 Lu , (4) \n( ) ( ) ( )[ ] ( )( ) ( )( )[ ]TTN kyQNkyQksksk 1,,,,1 \u2212\u2212\u2261\u2261 LLs ,(5) \n \n\u23a5\u23a5\n\u23a5\u23a5\n\u23a5\u23a5\n\u23a5\n\u23a6\n\u23a4\n\u23a2\u23a2\n\u23a2\u23a2\n\u23a2\u23a2\n\u23a2\n\u23a3\n\u23a1\n\u2212\u2212\n\u2261\n0\n1\n0\n100\n0\n0010\na\na\na\naN LLL\nLL\nOOM\nMOOOM\nL\nA\n and \n\u23a5\u23a5\n\u23a5\u23a5\n\u23a5\u23a5\n\u23a5\n\u23a6\n\u23a4\n\u23a2\u23a2\n\u23a2\u23a2\n\u23a2\u23a2\n\u23a2\n\u23a3\n\u23a1\n\u2261\n0\n1\n0\n00\n00\na\nb\na\nbN LLL\nLLL\nMM\nMM\nLLL\nB\n,(6) \nin which Q  is a one bit quantizer defined as follows: \n( )\n\u23a9\u23a8\n\u23a7\n\u2212\n\u2265\u2261\notherwise\ny\nyQ\n1\n01 . (7) \nSince the oversampling ratio of the SDM is usually very \nhigh, the input can be approximated as a step signal. Hence, \nwe further assume that ( ) uu =k  for 0\u2265k . \nIn many practical situations, the magnitude of the state \nvariables of the SDM should not be larger than certain values. \nFor the direct form realization, since all the state variables are \nthe delay versions of the output of the loop filter, we denote \nthe desired bound on the state variables as ccV . That is, \n( ) ccVkxi <  for Ni ,,2,1 L=  and 0\u2265k . Otherwise, the SDM is \nguaranteed to yield an unwanted behavior. Denote oB  as the \nset of the desired state vectors. That is, { }NiVxB io ,,2,1for: cc L=<\u2261 x . \nIII. CONDITIONS FOR OCCURRENCE OF LIMIT CYCLE \nBEHAVIORS AND LOCAL STABILITY CRITERION \nAs discussed in Section I, limit cycle behaviors should be \navoided. Hence, before we propose the fuzzy impulsive \ncontrol strategy, the conditions for exhibiting limit cycle \nbehavior are discussed below. This is essential for formulating \na fuzzy membership function for avoiding the occurrence of \nlimit cycle behavior. \nSuppose the eigen decomposition of matrix A  exists. That \nis, there exists a full rank matrix T  and a diagonal matrix D  \nwhich consist of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of matrix \nA , respectively, such that 1\u2212= TDTA .

Hence, there will not exist any fixed point or \nperiodic state sequence, and this completes the proof. \u0084 \nThe importance of this Lemma is to characterize the set of \ninitial condition that corresponds to the limit cycle behaviors \nwith period P  for 0kk \u2265 . This set of initial condition will be \nused for the formulation of fuzzy rules shown in Section IV. \nThis result is a generalization of [2]. In [2], it mainly \nconsiders the DC pole cases, that is 0=ik  for dni ,,2,1 L= . \nHowever, we reveal that even though there is not DC pole, but \nif there exist some poles on the unit circle with their phases \nare nonzero integer multiple of \nP\n\u03c02 , then the matrix Q  will \nalso drop rank. Besides, when there are more than one DC \npoles in the loop filter transfer function, if the degeneracy is \nequal to the multiplicity of the eigenvalues of matrix A , then \nthe eigen decomposition of matrix A  exists and Lemma 1 is \nstill applied. \nAs discussed in Section I and II, stability is an important \nissue. Hence, the stability analysis is performed before the \nfuzzy impulsive control strategy is proposed. Although the \nglobal stability of the SDMs is usually preferred because \nglobal stability implies local stability, sometimes global \nstability cannot be achieved. Only local stability can be \nachieved and local stability may be enough for some \napplications, such as for audio applications [2]. \nThe local stability is discussed as follows. Define the \nforward and backward dynamics of the system as \nNN \u211c\u2192\u211c\u2135 :f  and NN \u211c\u2192\u211c\u2135 :b , respectively.

However, the conditions \non the existence of the invariant map are not explored and this \nrelationship is explored in Lemma 2. \nIt is worth noting that if Zk \u2208\u2203 0  such that ( ) \u2118\u211c\u2208 \\0 Nkx , \nthen ( ) \u2118\u211c\u2208 \\Nkx  Zk\u2208\u2200 , and ( )kx  may diverge. Hence, it is \nnot sufficient to conclude the global stability of the SDMs. \nThe importance of Lemma 2 is that it provides information \nfor formulating a fuzzy membership function to achieve local \nstability. \nIV. FUZZY IMPULSIVE CONTROL STRATEGY \nA. Fuzzy impulsive control strategy \nFigure 2 shows the block diagram of how the fuzzy \nimpulsive controller influenced the SDMs. As discussed in \nSection I, the fuzzy impulsive controller determines the \ncontrolled state vectors and reset the state variables of the loop \nfilter to the controlled state variables via a reset circuit. To \ndetermine the controlled state vectors, two step procedures are \nemployed. The first step of the procedure is the training phase \nin which the invariant set and the set of state vectors that \nexhibits limit cycle behaviors are learnt through training. By \ngenerating a set of DC signals inputted to the system with \ndifferent initial condition, the state vectors are tested if they \nform an invariant set and exhibit limit cycle behaviors or not. \nThe second step of the procedure is the control phase in which \nthe controlled state vectors are determined and the state \nvariables are reset to the corresponding values. The details are \ndiscussed in below. \nAs discussed in Section I, we want to minimize the effect of \naudio clicks. To achieve this goal, we want to minimize the \ndistance between the original state vectors ( )10 +kx  and the \ncontrolled state vectors ( )10 +kcx . However, ( )10 +kx  may be \noutside the desired bounded region \n0B , so we define a vector \n0B\nr \u2208x  such that ( )\n20\n1 rk xx \u2212+  is minimum and our goal is \nto minimize the distance between ( )10 +kcx  and rx  via a \ntriangular fuzzy membership function as follows: \n( )( ) ( )( ) NN\ni\nrc\ni\nc kfk\n1\n1\n00continuous ,11 \u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b +\u2261+ \u220f\n=\nxxx\u03bc , (29) \nwhere \n( )( )\n( ) ( )\n( ) ( )\n\u23aa\u23aa\n\u23aa\n\u23a9\n\u23aa\u23aa\n\u23aa\n\u23a8\n\u23a7\n\u2264+\u2264\u2212+\n++\n\u2264+\u2264\u2212\n\u2212+\n\u2261+\notherwise0\n11\n11\n,1 0cc0\ncc0\n0\n0\nr\ni\nc\ni\ncc\nr\ni\ncc\nc\ni\nc\ni\nr\ni\ncc\nr\ni\ncc\nc\ni\nrc\ni xkxVVx\nVkx\nVkxx\nVx\nVkx\nkf xx\n. (30) \nSince a triangular fuzzy membership function is employed and \n0B\nr \u2208x , ( )( ) 110continuous =+kcx\u03bc  when ( ) rc k xx =+10 , \n( )( ) 010continuous =+kcx\u03bc  when ( ) 00 \\1 Bk Nc \u211c\u2208+x , and \n( )( ) 110 0continuous \u2264+\u2264 kcx\u03bc  ( ) Nc k \u211c\u2208+\u2200 10x . Hence, \n( )( )10continuous +kcx\u03bc  force the new state vectors ( )10 +kcx  to be \nwithin 0B . Note that if ( ) 00 1 Bk \u2208+x , then ( )10 += kr xx  and \nthere will be no audio click effect by setting ( ) rc k xx =+10 . \nSince ( )( )10continuous +kcx\u03bc  captures the knowledge on the \ncloseness between ( )10 +kcx  and rx , and the effect of audio \nclicks is minimized if ( )10 +kcx  is closed to rx , this fuzzy \nmembership function can minimize the effect of audio clicks. \nAs discussed in Section I and II, the local stability criterion \nis an important issue. According to Lemma 2, if ( ) Nbkx >\u2032  or \n( ) Nbkx <\u2032  and ( ) 1\u2212=NNbaQ , then ( ) \u2118\u2208kx  Zk\u2208\u2200  if \nZk \u2208\u2203 0  such that ( ) \u2118\u22080kx . However, the trajectory may not \nbe inside 0B  because \u2118 is usually not equal to 0B . In order to \nguarantee that the trajectory is bounded within 0B , we want \nthe controlled state vectors to be inside 0BI\u2118 , that is, \n( ) 00 1 Bkc I\u2118\u2208+x . Supposing that \u2260\u2118 0BI \u00d8. This implies \nthat there exist state vectors that achieve local stability within \nthe set of the desired bounded state variables. Denote \n0B\np I\u2118\u2208x  such that ( )\n20\n1 pk xx \u2212+  is minimum. If \n\u2260\u2118 0BI \u00d8, ( ) Nbkx >\u2032  or ( ) Nbkx <\u2032  and ( ) 1\u2212=NNbaQ , then \nwe define the following triangular fuzzy membership \nfunction: \n( )( ) ( )( ) NN\ni\npc\ni\nc kfk\n1\n1\n00stable ,11 \u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b +\u2261+ \u220f\n=\nxxx\u03bc . (31) \nThis article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue. \n \n \n5\n5\nSince a triangular fuzzy membership function is employed and \n0B\np \u2208x , ( )( ) 010stable =+kcx\u03bc  when ( ) 00 \\1 Bk Nc \u211c\u2208+x , \n( )( ) 110stable =+kcx\u03bc  when ( ) pc k xx =+10  and \n( )( ) 110 0stable \u2264+\u2264 kcx\u03bc  ( ) Nc k \u211c\u2208+\u2200 10x . Hence, \n( )( )10stable +kcx\u03bc  force the new state vectors ( )10 +kcx  to be \nwithin 0B . If ( ) 00 1 Bk I\u2118\u2208+x , then ( )10 += kp xx . By setting \n( ) pc k xx =+10 , the local stability criterion is satisfied. Since \n( )( )10stable +kcx\u03bc  captures the knowledge on the closeness \nbetween ( )10 +kcx  and px , which also reflects the closeness \nbetween ( )10 +kcx  and the set of state vectors that achieved \nlocal stability within the desired bounded region, this fuzzy \nmembership function can capture the local stability criterion \ninto the system. \nHowever, if =\u2118 0BI \u00d8, then px  does not exist. Or if \nZk \u2208\u2032\u2203  such that ( ) Nbkx <\u2032  and ( ) 1=NNbaQ , then the local \nstability criterion is not guaranteed. In this case, the SDM may \nsuffer from an instability problem. In order to avoid this case \nto be happened, if =\u2118 0BI \u00d8, or if Zk \u2208\u2032\u2203  such that \n( ) Nbkx <\u2032  and ( ) 1=NNbaQ , then we define \n( )( ) ( )( )\u23a9\u23a8\n\u23a7\n\u211c\u2208+\n\u2208+\u2261+\n00\n00stable\n0stable \\10\n1\n1\nBk\nBk\nk Nc\nc\nc\nx\nx\nx\n\u03b4\u03bc , (32) \nwhere 01 stable >\u2265 \u03b4  and stable\u03b4  is very closed to zero. The \nreasons why small value of stable\u03b4  can avoid the instability \nproblem are discussed in Section IVB. Since the fuzzy \nmembership value of the state vectors outside 0B  is exactly \nequal to zero, this fuzzy membership function will force the \nnew state vectors ( )10 +kcx  to be within 0B . \nAs discussing in Section I, the occurrence of limit cycle \nbehaviors should be avoided. Since U\n0>\u2200\n\u03a8\nP\nP\n is the set of state \nvectors that exhibiting limit cycle behavior, we do not want to \nmove the new state vectors ( )10 +kcx  into U\n0>\u2200\n\u03a8\nP\nP\n. Moreover, \nwe do not want to move ( )10 +kcx  into ( ){ }U\n0kk\nk\n\u2264\u2200\nx  too. This is \nbecause after a certain number of iterations, the state vectors \nmay go to the same points in the state space and cause limit \ncycle behaviors to occur. Define \n( ) ( ){ }\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u03a8\u2261\n\u2264\u2200>\u2200\nUU U\n00\n0\nkkP\nP kkPER x . (33) \nIf ( ) 000 BBkPER =I , then all the state vectors in 0B  may \nresult limit cycle behaviors and this situation should be \navoided. On the other hand, if ( ) =00 BkPER I \u00d8, then we \ncannot find a state vector ( )00 kPERBq I\u2208x  such that \n( )\n20\n1 qk xx \u2212+  is minimum. Hence, if ( ) 000 BBkPER =I  or \n( ) =00 BkPER I \u00d8, we define the fuzzy membership function as \n( )( ) ( )( )\u23a9\u23a8\n\u23a7\n\u211c\u2208+\n\u2208+\u2261+\n00\n00aperiodic\n0aperiodic \\10\n1\n1\nBk\nBk\nk Nc\nc\nc\nx\nx\nx\n\u03b4\u03bc , (34) \nwhere 01 aperiodic >\u2265 \u03b4  and aperiodic\u03b4  is also very closed to zero. \nSimilarly, the reason why small value of \naperiodic\u03b4  can avoid the \noccurrence of limit cycle behaviors is discussed in Section \nIVB. Otherwise, we define the fuzzy membership function as \n( )( ) ( )( ) ( )\n( )\u23aa\u23a9\n\u23aa\u23a8\n\u23a7\n\u211c\u2208+\n\u2208+\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b +\u2212\u2261+ \u220f\n=\n00\n00\n1\n1\n00aperiodic\n\\10\n1,111\nBk\nBkkfk\nNc\nc\nNN\ni\nqc\nic\nx\nxxxx\u03bc .(35) \nSince if  is a triangular fuzzy membership function and \n0B\nq \u2208x , ( )( ) 010aperiodic =+kcx\u03bc  when ( ) ( )000 1 kPERBk I\u2208+x  \nbecause ( )10 += kq xx  when ( ) ( )000 1 kPERBk I\u2208+x , \n( )( ) 010aperiodic =+kcx\u03bc  when ( ) 00 \\1 Bk Nc \u211c\u2208+x  and \n( )( ) 110 0aperiodic \u2264+\u2264 kcx\u03bc  ( ) Nc k \u211c\u2208+\u2200 10x . Hence, \n( )( )10aperiodic +kcx\u03bc  force the new state vectors ( )10 +kcx  to be \nwithin 0B . Since ( )( )10aperiodic +kcx\u03bc  captures the knowledge on \nthe separation between ( )10 +kcx  and ( )00 kPERB I , which \nalso reflects the separation between ( )10 +kcx  and the set of \nstate vectors within the desired bounded region that exhibits \nlimit cycle behaviors, ( )( )10aperiodic +kcx\u03bc  can be used to avoid \nthe occurrence of limit cycle behaviors. \nOnce the fuzzy membership functions are defined, we can \ndefine the fuzzy impulsive control law as follows: \nIf ( ) ( )( )( ) 000 \\ BkQk N\u211c\u2208\u2212+ xuBAx , then the fuzzy \nimpulsive controller will reset the state variables of the loop \nfilter to ( )10 +kcx  where ( )10 +kcx  is the state vector such that \nthe following function is maximized, \n( ) ( )( )\n( ) ( )( ) ( )( ) ( )( )( ) 310continuous0aperiodic0stable1\n01\n111max\n1\n0\n0\n+++\n\u2261+\n\u211c\u2208+\n+\nkkk\nk\nccc\nk\nc\nk\nNc\nc\nxxx\nx\nx\nx\n\u03bc\u03bc\u03bc\n\u03bc\n.(36) \nOtherwise, no control force is applied to the SDMs. \nLemma 3 \n\u211c\u2208\u2200u , ( ) N\u211c\u2208\u2200 0x , \u211c\u2208\u2200 ia  for Ni ,,1,0 L=  and \n\u211c\u2208\u2200 jb  for Nj ,,1 L= , ( ) 0Bkc \u2208x  for 0>k . \nProof: \nIt can be seen that \u211c\u2208\u2200u , ( ) N\u211c\u2208\u2200 0x , \u211c\u2208\u2200 ia  for \nNi ,,1,0 L= , \u211c\u2208\u2200 jb  for Nj ,,1 L= , 00 \u2265\u2200k  and \n( ) 00 1 Bkc \u2208+\u2200x , ( )( ) 010continuous >+kcx\u03bc  and \n( )( ) 010stable >+kcx\u03bc .

However, Lemma 3 is still applied even \nthough =\u2118 \u00d8 or 0B=\u2118 , and =\u03a8\n>\u2200\nU\n0P\nP\n\u00d8 or \n0\n0\nB\nP\nP =\u03a8\n>\u2200\nU . \nHence, Lemma 3 guarantees that the controlled trajectory is \nbounded within 0B  no matter what the input step size, the \ninitial condition and the filter parameters are. This is very \nimportant because we do not want the trajectory of the SDM \nto be unbounded if the input step size is increased, or the \ninitial condition or the loop filter of the SDMs are changed. \nAnother advantage of this fuzzy impulsive control strategy is \nthat we can alter the maximum bound of the state variables \neasily by setting the value of ccV  appropriately, which is \nindependent of the input step size, the initial condition and the \nfilter parameters. \nLemma 4 \n\u211c\u2208\u2200u , ( ) N\u211c\u2208\u2200 0x , \u211c\u2208\u2200 ia  for Ni ,,1,0 L=  and \n\u211c\u2208\u2200 jb  for Nj ,,1 L= , ( ) NVk rc cc2 21 \u2264\u2212+ xx  for 0>k . \nProof: \nSince \u211c\u2208\u2200u , ( ) N\u211c\u2208\u2200 0x , \u211c\u2208\u2200 ia  for Ni ,,1,0 L=  and \n\u211c\u2208\u2200 jb  for Nj ,,1 L= , ( ) 0Bkc \u2208x  for 0>k , the result \nfollows directly. \u0084 \nThe importance of this Lemma is that it guarantees the \nnorm of the difference between rx  and ( )1+kcx  being \nbounded by NVcc2 , no matter what the input step size, the \ninitial condition and the filter parameters are. As discussed in \nabove, we do not want the norm of the difference between rx  \nand ( )1+kcx  to be too large because the effect of audio clicks \nmay be too large for these situations. \nLemma 5 \nIf Zk \u2208\u2203 0  such that ( ) 00 BBkPER \u2260I  for 0kk \u2265 , and \n( ) ( )( )( ) 000 \\ BkQk N\u211c\u2208\u2212+ xuBAx , then 0>\u2203\/M  such that \n( ) ( )Mkk cc += xx  for 0kk > . \nProof: \nThe proof follows directly from Lemma 3. \u0084 \nThe importance of this Lemma is that it states the condition \nthat limit cycle behaviors do not occur when the fuzzy \nimpulsive control strategy is applied at once. We will show \nthe contrast in Section V that the clipping control strategy \nusually results in the limit cycle behaviors, while our approach \nwill minimize the occurrence of limit cycle behaviors. \nB. Parameters in the fuzzy impulsive controller \nThere are only three parameters in the fuzzy impulsive \ncontrol strategy. They are ccV , aperiodic\u03b4  and stable\u03b4 . ccV  is the \nmaximum allowable bound on each state variable and this \nvalue is determined based on the real situations, such as the \nhardware constraints and the safety specifications, etc. For \nexample, if the hardware operates normally in a safe condition \nonly when the state variables are bounded by V20 , then ccV  \nmay be set accordingly. For the parameters \naperiodic\u03b4  and stable\u03b4 , \nthe fuzzy impulsive controller works properly ( ]1,0aperiodic \u2208\u2200\u03b4  \nand ( ]1,0stable \u2208\u2200\u03b4 . However, since aperiodic\u03b4  represents the \nfuzzy membership value of how to avoid the occurrence of \nlimit cycle at ( )10 +kcx  when ( ) 000 BBkPER =I  or \n( ) =00 BkPER I \u00d8, and all the state vectors in 0B  may cause the \ntrajectory to exhibit limit cycle behaviors if ( ) 000 BBkPER =I , \nwe suggest the SDM control designers to set this value as a \nsmall number closed to zero, such as 310\u2212 . For stable\u03b4 , since it \nrepresents the fuzzy membership value of the local stability of \nthe SDM at ( )10 +kcx  when =\u2118 0BI \u00d8, or if Zk \u2208\u2032\u2203  such that \n( ) Nbkx <\u2032  and ( ) 1=NNbaQ , and in this case, the SDM may \nexhibit divergent behavior if the fuzzy impulsive control \nstrategy is not applied, we recommend the SDM control \ndesigners to set this value as a small number closed to zero \ntoo, for example, 310\u2212 . \nC. Complexity issue \nAlthough more fuzzy rules and sophisticated fuzzy engine \nwill improve the performance of the SDMs, this will increase \nthe complexity of the system and may cause real time \nprocessing problems, particular for audio applications [2]. The \nNyquist rate for audio signal is 44.1kHz [2], since the input \nsignals are typically oversampled at 64 or 128 [2], the number \nof samples inputted to the SDM per second is 2.8224M or \n5.6448M. Because several megasamples are needed to process \nper second, only three basic fuzzy rules are captured and only \na simple fuzzy engine is used to reduce the complexity for \nprocessing. According to the simulation results shown in \nSection V, these three basic rules and a simple fuzzy engine is \nenough for achieving the objectives. \nD. Implementation of the fuzzy impulsive controller \nAs discussed in the above, the fuzzy impulsive controller \nresets the state variables of the loop filter to the controlled \nstate variables of ( )10 +kcx  if \n( ) ( )( )( ) 000 \\ BkQk N\u211c\u2208\u2212+ xuBAx , and ( )10 +kcx  is calculated \nbased on equation (36). Numerical solvers, such as MATLAB \nor MATCAD, can be employed for solving equation (36). To \nreset the state variables of the loop filter, many existing reset \ncircuits can be employed [8]. \nV. SIMULATION RESULTS \nTo illustrate our results, a fifth order SDM with loop filter \ntransfer function \nThis article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue. \n \n \n7\n7\n54321\n54321\n0025.10075.50075.100025.1051\n9584.140015.640497.1037420\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\n\u2212+\u2212+\u2212\n+\u2212+\u2212\nzzzzz\nzzzzz  (37) \nis illustrated. This fifth order SDM is commonly employed in \nthe industry [2]. The SDM can be implemented via the Jordan \nform [2] and can be realized as the following state space \nequation \n( ) ( ) ( ) ( )( )kykukk \u2212+=+ BxAx ~~~1~  (38) \nfor 0\u2265k , where \n( ) ( )( )kQky xC~~= , (39) \n\u23a5\u23a5\n\u23a5\u23a5\n\u23a5\u23a5\n\u23a6\n\u23a4\n\u23a2\u23a2\n\u23a2\u23a2\n\u23a2\u23a2\n\u23a3\n\u23a1\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2261\n11000\n000685.01100\n00110\n000018.011\n00001\n~A\n, \n\u23a5\u23a5\n\u23a5\u23a5\n\u23a5\u23a5\n\u23a6\n\u23a4\n\u23a2\u23a2\n\u23a2\u23a2\n\u23a2\u23a2\n\u23a3\n\u23a1\n\u2261\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n~B\n and \nT\n\u23a5\u23a5\n\u23a5\u23a5\n\u23a5\u23a5\n\u23a6\n\u23a4\n\u23a2\u23a2\n\u23a2\u23a2\n\u23a2\u23a2\n\u23a3\n\u23a1\n\u2261\n00589.0\n09375.0\n1\n6\n20\n~C\n.(40) \nAssume that the initial condition of this SDM is zero, that is, \n( ) [ ]T0,0,0,0,00~ =x . By using a simple transformation, \nthis SDM can be realized by the direct form and the \ncorresponding initial condition is \n( ) [ ]T9793.35,25.32,5.28,5,00 \u2212=x  when 75.0=u . We \ncan check that the trajectory of this SDM is bounded for this \ninitial condition ( ( ) [ ]T0,0,0,0,00~ =x ) if the input step \nsize is approximately between 71.0\u2212  and 75.0 , and may \ndiverge if the input step size is outside this range. The \nrelationship between the maximum absolute value of the state \nvariables (realized in the direct form) and the input step size is \nplotted in Figure 3. From the simulation result, we can see that \neven though the trajectory is bounded for this range of input \nstep size, the maximum absolute value of the state variables is \nbetween 0523.20  and 4633.59 , which may be too large for \nsome practical applications [2]. Figure 3 also shows the plot \nof the maximum absolute value of the state variables (also \nrealized in the direct form) for 0>k  versus the input step size \nwhen the fuzzy impulsive control strategy is applied at \n20=ccV . According to Lemma 3, the maximum absolute \nvalue of the state variables of the controlled SDM is bounded \nby ccV  for 0>k  and \u211c\u2208\u2200u , even though ccVu \u2265 . Hence, we \ncan guarantee that the state variables are bounded by 20. \nThis SDM is not globally stable. That means, ( ) N\u211c\u2208\u2203 0~x  \nsuch that the trajectory is unbounded. For example, when \n75.0=u , Figure 4a and Figure 4b show the responses of ( )kx1  \nwith ( ) [ ]T0,0,0,0,00~ =x  and \n( ) [ ]T0,0,0,0,001.00~ =x , respectively. It can be seen \nfrom Figure 4a and Figure 4b that even though the SDM \nexhibits acceptable behavior when ( ) [ ]T0,0,0,0,00~ =x  \nand the difference between these two initial conditions is very \nsmall, the SDM exhibits divergent behavior when \n( ) [ ]T0,0,0,0,001.00~ =x  and the behaviors of the SDM \nfor these two different initial conditions are very different. On \nthe other hand, according to Lemma 3, the maximum absolute \nvalue of the state variables is always bounded by ccV  for 0>k  \nand ( ) N\u211c\u2208\u2200 0x  if the fuzzy impulsive control strategy is \napplied. Figure 4c and 4d show the corresponding state \nresponses when the fuzzy impulsive control strategy is applied \nat 40=ccV . From the simulation result, we see that the SDM \nexhibits acceptable behavior with the state variables bounded \nby ccV  for both of these two initial conditions. \nFor comparison with other control strategies, consider the \ntime delay feedback control strategy proposed in [6], in which \nthe controller is in the form of ( )1c 1 \u2212\u2212\u2212 zK . Denote i\u03bb  for \n6,,2,1 L=i  be the poles of the effective loop filter. Since i\u03bb  \nfor 6,,2,1 L=i  depends on the value of cK , it can be shown \nthat 1max\n6,,2,1\n>\n= ii\n\u03bb\nL\n \u211c\u2208\u2200 cK  and the minimum value of \nii\n\u03bb\n6,,2,1\nmax\nL=\n occurs at 0c =K . When 0c =K , it reduces to the \nuncontrolled case. By selecting a value of cK  which is very \nclosed to zero, for example 5c 102\n\u2212\u00d7=K , and setting the initial \ncondition and the input step size as the previous values, that \nis, ( ) [ ]T5612.39,9793.35,25.32,5.28,5,00 \u2212=x  and \n75.0=u  (the initial condition is determined based on zero \ninitial condition of the Jordan form), it is found that the \ntrajectory diverges as shown in Figure 5. Hence, the time \ndelay feedback control strategy fails to stabilize this SDM. \nTo compare the fuzzy impulsive control strategy to the \nclipping control strategy, that is, set ( ) ( )( )kxQVkx ii cc=  if \n( ) ccVkxi \u2265  for Ni ,,2,1 L= , it is found that limit cycle \nbehaviors may occur if the clipping control strategy is applied. \nFigure 6 shows the magnitude response of ( )ks  when \n75.0=u , ( ) [ ]T0,0,0,0,00~ =x  and the clipped level is \nset at 40. It can be seen from Figure 6 that there is an impulse \nlocated at \n2\n\u03c0  if the clipping control strategy is applied, which \ndemonstrates that the SDM exhibits a limit cycle with period \n2. On the other hand, the spectrum is quite flat for the SDM \nwhen the fuzzy impulsive control strategy is applied with \n40=ccV , which demonstrates that the SDM exhibits \nacceptable behavior and the limit cycle behavior is avoided. \nFigure 7 shows the SNR of SDMs under the clipping \ncontrol strategy with the clipped level set at 28. SNR is \ncalculated using [9], where the frequency of the input \nsinusoidal signals is \n3\n2  of the passband bandwidth. The \noversampling ratio is 64, and initial conditions are given by \n( ) [ ]T0,0,0,0,00~ =x . It can be seen from Figure 7 that \nthe SNR of both the clipping and fuzzy impulsive control \nstrategies with the state variables bounded by 28 are the same \nwhen the input magnitude is less than 52.0 . This is because \nboth the maximum absolute value of the state variables \n(realized in the direct form) do not exceed 28 in this input \nmagnitude range. However, if the input magnitude exceeds \nthis range, the SNR corresponding to the clipping control \nThis article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue. \n \n \n8\n8\n+  )(ky\n_ \n+  \n_ \nstrategy may drop to less than 1.2562dB because of the \noccurrence of limit cycle behaviors. On the other hand, the \nSDM performs normally under the fuzzy impulsive control \nstrategy. Hence, the SNR of the SDM under the fuzzy \nimpulsive control strategy has an average of 41.8281dB \nimprovement compared to the clipping control strategy for \noutside this input magnitude range. \nIt can be seen from Figure 8 that the probability of the \ncontrol force to be applied by the fuzzy impulsive control \nstrategy is 0.0135 for the input magnitude range greater than \nor equal to 0.52, as opposed to a probability of 0.6926 for the \nclipping control strategy. Hence, the number of reset action on \nthe state variables of the loop filter is much reduced when \napplying fuzzy impulsive control strategy. This is because the \nfuzzy impulsive control strategy tends to reset the state vectors \ninside the invariant set if it exists and the state vectors will \ntend to stay inside the invariant set without applying control \nforce again soon afterwards. This demonstrates that the fuzzy \nimpulsive control strategy is more efficient than the clipping \ncontrol strategy. \nTo verify the independence of the filter parameters on the \nfuzzy impulsive control strategy, consider another fifth order \nSDM with the following transfer function [2] \n54321\n54321\n0023.10069.50069.100023.1051\n5498.03873.29094.38630.27919.0\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\n\u2212+\u2212+\u2212\n+\u2212+\u2212\nzzzzz\nzzzzz .(41) \nThis SDM is also widely used in the industry [2]. The \ntrajectory of this SDM with 59.0=u  and \n( ) [ ]T0,0,0,0,00~ =x  is shown in Figure 9a, and it can be \nseen from Figure 9a that the trajectory diverges. On the other \nhand, when the fuzzy impulsive control strategy is applied \nwith 2=ccV , according to Lemma 3, the maximum absolute \nvalue of the state variables (realized in the direct form) is \nalways bounded by ccV  for 0>k , \u211c\u2208\u2200 ia  for Ni ,,1,0 L=  \nand \u211c\u2208\u2200 jb  for Nj ,,1 L= , as shown in Figure 9b. \nVI. CONCLUSION \nIn this paper, we have proposed the fuzzy impulsive control \nstrategy for the stabilization of high order interpolative SDMs \nin which the occurrence of limit cycle behaviors and the effect \nof audio clicks are minimized. Since the effective poles of the \nloop filter are not affected by the control strategy, the SNR \nperformance of the SDMs is maintained or improved after \ncontrol. Moreover, the controlled trajectory is guaranteed to \nbe bounded no matter what the input step size, the initial \ncondition and the filter parameters are. Comparisons between \nthe fuzzy impulsive control strategy and some existing control \nstrategies show that the fuzzy impulsive control strategy is \nmuch effective in terms of producing much higher SNR and \nefficient in terms of requiring less control force applied to the \nsystem. \nREFERENCES \n[1] James C.
