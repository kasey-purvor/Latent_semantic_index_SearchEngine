There is increasing\nconcern over the likely clinical and public health\nimplications of the epidemic.4 5 However, child-\nhood obesity is difficult to treat and there remains\na great deal of uncertainty surrounding its preva-\nlence, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. The\nuncertainty and confusion has led to wide varia-\ntion in clinical practice. The present review aims\nto provide evidence based answers to five fre-\nquently asked questions: How should obesity be\ndiagnosed? What is its prevalence in the UK? Is it\npreventable? Is it treatable? How should it be\nmanaged?\nMETHODS\nLiterature searching\nWe searched for systematic reviews and meta-\nanalyses using Medline, Embase, Cinahl, Health-\nstar, the Cochrane Library, and the internet from\nJanuary 1991 to April 2000. Searching for other\nstudy designs used the same databases from\nJanuary 1981 to June 2000 and was supple-\nmented by manual searching of reference lists of\nall identified papers, and by manual searching of\nreference lists of key specialist journals from\nJanuary 1997 to June 2000. We identified a\nCochrane review on interventions for prevention\nof obesity in children,6 a protocol for a Cochrane\nreview on interventions for treatment of obesity\nin children,7 and a systematic review which\nincluded children but focused largely on adults.8\nWe compared search results from the present\nreview as a check on the quality of literature\nsearching.\nEvidence appraisal\nEvidence appraisal used methodology described\nelsewhere.9 In summary, evidence from the\nsearches was identified using inclusion criteria\nspecific to each question. Two reviewers then\nappraised each paper independently and agreed\non an evidence level and methodological quality\nrating using the hierarchy of study types pub-\nlished elsewhere.9 In brief, this hierarchy con-\nsisted of the following.\n\u2022 Evidence level 1, systematic reviews and meta-\nanalyses of randomised controlled trials\n(RCTs); RCTs\n\u2022 Evidence level 2, non-randomised intervention\nstudies, observational\/cohort studies\n\u2022 Evidence level 3, non-experimental studies, sur-\nveys\n\u2022 Evidence level 4, expert opinion.\nFollowing published criteria,9 studies were rated\nas : ++ (all or most methodological criteria met,\nlow risk of bias); + (some criteria not fulfilled or\nstudy inadequately described, but low risk of\nbias); \u2212 (few or no criteria fulfilled, high risk of\nbias). Grades of recommendations (A\u2013D) are\nbased on the strength of the supporting evidence,\ntaking into account its overall level and the\nconsidered judgement of the authors.9\nRESULTS\nQuestion 1: How should obesity be\ndiagnosed and assessed?\nInclusion criteria\nStudies were included: if they assessed the ability\nof the body mass index (BMI) to identify children\nwith high body fat percentage; if they assessed\nrelations between BMI centile and obesity associ-\nated morbidity (for example, cardiovascular risk\nfactors); or if they compared subjective and\nobjective assessment of obesity. Expert committee\nrecommendations were also included .\nUse of the BMI\nCross and colleagues10 (table 1) found that\n(subjective) clinical judgements were inadequate,\neven when made by experienced observers\n(evidence level 3). Expert committees have consist-\nently recommended an objective approach (grade\nD), based on the bodymass index centile (grade B)\n(table 1). Many other authors (in editorials, for\nexample) have also recommended the BMI, but\nthese forms of evidence were not formally\nappraised. The main advantages of BMI are that it\nis practical, objective, provides a degree of\nconsistency with adult practice, and is biologi-\ncally meaningful.\nThe BMI is lower in children\/adolescents than\nin adults, so adult obesity definitions (such as\nBMI >30.0) should not be applied.

For the\nUK, national reference data for BMI are available.11 These data\nrepresent the BMI of British children in 1990 and are widely\navailable in the form of centile charts.11 12\nOne important consideration with BMI is its ability to suc-\ncessfully classify overweight\/obese children and adolescents\u2014\nthat is, its sensitivity and specificity in identification of the\nfattest children. Nine studies (evidence levels 2+ to 3) addressed\nthis question (table 1) by making direct measurements of\nbody fatness and testing the ability of cut offs applied to the\nupper end of the BMI distribution to correctly classify the fat-\ntest children. These concluded that a BMI cut off in the upper\nend of the BMI range (for example, above the 85th centile)\nwas specific for obesity (low false positive rate). Expert\ncommittees have viewed this as the main consideration when\ndiagnosing obesity as it avoids problems associated with stig-\nmatising children or providing unnecessary treatment.13 How-\never, the magnitude of the false negative problem depends on\nthe cut off which is used. When using BMI >91st centile on\nthe UK 1990 charts for British children, sensitivity is\nmoderately high and specificity high.14 In practice, clinical\nassessment of obesity in British children using British BMI\ncentile charts will be robust provided that an appropriate cut\noff (for example, BMI >98th centile) is used. Serial measures\nof BMI, plotted on the chart, can assess changes over time. In\nepidemiological use, other cut offs (for example, 85th centile\nfor overweight and 95th centile for obesity) will remain\ncommon.2 13 BMI cut offs above the 85th centile are also clini-\ncally meaningful. A good deal of evidence shows that children\nwith high BMI are at greatest risk from the morbidity associ-\nated with childhood obesity. This includes studies showing\nassociations of BMI with morbidity in childhood,15 with\npersistence of obesity into adulthood,16 and with presence and\nclustering of cardiovascular risk factors (evidence level 2++ to\n2+).17\u201319\n\u201cInternational\u201d BMI reference data have been proposed\nrecently for global comparisons of childhood obesity\nprevalence.20 One British study reported improved screening\nability (higher sensitivity; high specificity) when national\n(UK) reference data were used, compared to use of the inter-\nnational reference data.14 Sensitivity of the definition of obes-\nity using the international reference data differed significantly\nbetween the sexes, with low sensitivity in girls and extremely\nlow sensitivity in boys.14 International BMI cut offs for BMI in\nchildren have not been related to obesity related morbidity in\nchildhood. They require further testing, with evidence of\nexternal validity, before they are adopted. A more extensive\ndiscussion of the use of international reference data has been\npublished elsewhere.21\nQuestion 2: What is the prevalence of paediatric\nobesity in the UK?\nInclusion criteria\nStudies were included if they used a definition of obesity\nbased on BMI, in British children. This included nationally\nrepresentative surveys, regional\/local surveys, and cohort\nstudies (table 1).\nPrevalence estimates\nAll three studies identified by the original search indicated a\nhigher prevalence of obesity than expected (evidence level 2+ to\n3) (table 1). Only one study was based on a nationally\nrepresentative sample : obesity prevalence ranged from 11% in\n6 year olds to 17% in 15 year olds in England in 1996.1 This\nevidence shows a notable increase in overweight and obesity\nprevalence from the early 1990s in the UK. All studies\nconcluded that risk increases with age during childhood and\nadolescence (evidence level 2+ to 3). One study found that obes-\nity prevalence increased with increasing social deprivation22\n(evidence level 3). Obesity prevalence was generally not notably\ndifferent between boys and girls (evidence level 2+ to 3).\nTable 1 Summary of evidence appraised, questions 1\u20134\nStudy: first author, year Reference\nEvidence\nlevel\nQuestion 1: How should obesity be diagnosed and assessed?\nSE Barlow, 1998 13 4\nJH Himes, 1994 Am J Clin Nutr 59:307\u201316 4\nEME Poskitt, 1995 Acta Paediatr 84:961\u20133 4\nC Power, 1997 Int J Obes 21:507\u201326 2++\nMC Bellizzi, 1999 Am J Clin Nutr 70:173\u2013177s 4\nM de Onis, 1996 Am J Clin Nutr 64:650\u20138 4\nJH Cross, 1995 10 3\nJJ Reilly, 1999 Int J Obes 23:217\u201319 3\nJT Warner, 1997 Ann Hum Biol 24:209\u201315 3\nJJ Reilly, 2000 14 2+\nLB Sardinha, 1999 Am J Clin Nutr 70:1090\u20135 3\nJH Himes, 1999 Int J Obes 23:s18\u2013s21s 3\nJD Marshall, 1991 Hum Biol 63:137\u201353 3\nR Malina, 1999 Am J Clin Nutr 70: s131\u2013s136 3\nF Schaefer, 1998 Int J Obes 22:461\u20139 3\nR Lazarus, 1996 Am J Clin Nutr 63:500\u20136 2\nQuestion 2: What is the prevalence of obesity in the UK?\nJJ Reilly, 1999 1 3\nJJ Reilly, 1999 BMJ 319:1039 2+\nSJ Kinra, 1999 22 2+\nQuestion 3: Is childhood obesity preventable?\nRV Luepker, 1996 JAMA 275:768\u201376 1+\nSL Gortmaker, 1999 Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med 153:409\u201318 1+\nQuestion 4: Is childhood obesity treatable?\nLM Mellin, 1987 J Am Diet Assoc 87:333\u20138 1+\nLH Epstein, 1995 Health Psychol 14:109\u201315 1+\nLH Epstein, 2000 Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med 154:220\u20136 1+\nObesity: diagnosis, prevention, and treatment 393\nwww.archdischild.com\n on 5 November 2009 adc.bmj.comDownloaded from \nQuestion 3: Is childhood obesity preventable?\nInclusion criteria\nFor inclusion, papers had to report a randomised controlled\ntrial (RCT) study design, in a study population drawn from\nnon-clinical samples (that is, subjects from community,\nschool, or nursery), and had to include an objective weight\nrelated outcome measure such as BMI or weight change.\nStudies of both obesity prevention and treatment (question 4)\nwere only included if outcomemeasures were obtained at least\n12 months after the start of the intervention, on the grounds\nthat short term lifestyle change might not be sustainable in\nthe longer term, so short term studies carried a high risk of\nbias. For questions 3 and 4, RCTs with a negative quality rat-\ning were not used as the basis of recommendations and\nexcluded from this review, though reference details and\nevidence tables are available from the authors.\nEvidence appraisal and summary\nThree RCTs were identified, but only two studies met our\ninclusion criteria (Gortmaker et al, 1999; Luepker et al, 1996;\ntable 1). Both studied large samples of schoolchildren, and\nwere of high methodological quality. In both, interventions\nwere complex, with focus on: diet; physical inactivity (target-\ning reduced TV viewing); physical activity; involvement of\nschools with changes to curricula; involvement of family. Both\ninterventions were resource intensive, and from the USA. This\nprobably limits the generalisability of their conclusions. Luep-\nker et al (1996) found no significant differences in weight\nrelated outcome indices at three year follow up. Gortmaker et\nal (1999) reported that obesity risk was significantly reduced\nin girls, but not in boys. In summary, there is some doubt as to\nwhether obesity is preventable in school age children, using\ncurrently available intervention strategies (evidence level 1+).\nFurther research is indicated, though more recent evidence,\npublished after the present literature review had been\ncompleted, is not promising.23\nQuestion 4: Is childhood obesity treatable?\nInclusion criteria\nWe included only RCTs , with a study population of children\nwho were defined as obese, and who were followed for at least\n12 months post-intervention, for the reasons given above.\nEvidence appraisal and summary\nWe identified 16 studies which met our inclusion criteria. Of\nthese, 12 were from the USA and six were from the same\nresearch group. No evidence on drug treatment or residential\ntreatment (\u201cfat camps\u201d) met our criteria. Only three of the 13\ntrials did not have major methodological flaws, and these were\nrated as evidence level 1+ (summarised in table 1). Most of\nthe other trials were older studies carried out before the recent\ndevelopment of guidelines for conduct and reporting of RCTs.\nAll were graded as 1\u2212 (high risk of bias).\nThe three high quality studies all delivered complex\ninterventions aimed at achieving long term behavioural\nchange, were resource intensive, and were conducted in\nspecialist clinics (two from the same research group). The\nstudies are therefore difficult to summarise, and there are\ndoubts about their generalisability. In each case diet was com-\nbined with lifestyle interventions intended to increase physi-\ncal activity levels, and families were involved. Increases in\nphysical activity were targeted by a focus on reduction in sed-\nentary behaviour (particularly TV viewing), and\/or lifestyle\nphysical activity (for example, walking). In all three studies,\ntreatment significantly reduced indices of overweight\/obesity\n(evidence level 1+). In the absence of clearly generalisable\nevidence on treatment strategies, further research is indicated.\nExpert committee recommendations therefore remain useful.\nThese recommend focus on diet and control of sedentary\nbehaviour, with family involvement.13\nQuestion 5: What do I do with the obese child or\nadolescent?\nThis question has three components: Who should be treated?\nWhat should treatment aims be? Who should be referred?\nRecommendations from expert committees\/consensus state-\nments were the only evidence which was identifiable to\nanswer these questions (evidence level 4). These are summarised\nin box 1 and are widely available via the internet.13 Evidence\nbased guidelines from the UK (Scottish Intercollegiate Guide-\nlines Network), based in part on this systematic review, should\nbe available in 2002.\nCONCLUSIONS\n(1) Paediatric obesity is now common in the UK, as in other\ndeveloped countries.\n(2) Obesity should be diagnosed using the BMI centile on the\nUK 1990 reference charts (Child Growth Foundation,\nLondon, UK; printed by Harlow Printing, South Shields,\nUK), and this should also be used to monitor changes in\nweight status (grade of recommendation B).\n(3) There is no conclusive evidence that childhood obesity is\npreventable at present, but more research is required. A\nnumber of approaches to treatment are promising,\nnotably the control of sedentary behaviour such as TV\nviewing. These merit further evaluation.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank Francesca Chappell for her assistance with literature\nsearching.

However, a proportion (estimated tobe between 5% to 30%1) present beyond the neonatal period.\nWe report a case of an 18 month old child who presented with acute tension pneumothorax.\nThe previously healthy 18 month old boy, who had had an uneventful neonatal period, was\nadmitted with a two day history of cough and vomiting. He was febrile, poorly perfused, tach-\nypnoeic, and unresponsive. He was resuscitated and intubated. Chest x ray (fig 1) showed a large\nleft pneumothorax, with mediastinal shift and gastric or intestinal air bubble above the\ndiaphragm. A chest drain was inserted, releasing air and dark brown fluid. Microscopy revealed\na mixture of Gram positive and negative cocci and bacilli, implying gastrointestinal perforation.\nHe was transferred to the paediatric intensive care unit with a provisional diagnosis of strangu-\nlated congenital diaphragmatic hernia. This was confirmed at laparotomy with perforation sec-\nondary to ischaemia. Stomach, colon, and spleen were reduced from the left hemithorax and a\ngastric perforation repaired. The child made a satisfactory postoperative recovery.\nWith an incidence of 1 in 3000 live births, congenital diaphragmatic hernia is relatively com-\nmon. However, this diagnosis is often not considered after the neonatal period. CDH should be\nconsidered in any infant or child presenting with respiratory symptoms, particularly where the\nchest x ray shows a poorly defined diaphragm and cystic lesion on their chest x ray film.2\nC P O\u2019Neill\nR Mabrouk\nW A McCallion\nPaediatric Intensive Care Unit, Royal Belfast Hospital For Sick Children, Falls Road, Belfast BT12 6BE, UK;\nconoroneill@doctorsnet.org.uk\nReferences\n1 Gleeson F, Spitz L.
