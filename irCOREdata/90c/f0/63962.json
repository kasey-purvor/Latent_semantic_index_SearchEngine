In many cases, EAF will \nalso require models that predict the effects of human activities in terms of these \nobjectives. Unfortunately, marine ecosystems are structurally complex, spatially and \ntemporally variable, and difficult and costly to observe, all of which lead to \nconsiderable uncertainty in model predictions. Fisheries scientists have been at the \nforefront of attempts to account for uncertainty in the management of living resources \n(Patterson et al. 2001; Harwood and Stokes 2003). However, effort has largely \nfocused on uncertainty in parameter values and the process uncertainty that arises \nfrom natural variation, whereas uncertainties about model structure have received less \nattention. For example, Halpern et al.\u2019s (2006) review of methods to evaluate rules for \nspacing marine reserves given different levels of uncertainty did not consider \nuncertainties in model structure. \nNeglecting model uncertainty can lead to under-representation of uncertainty in \nmodel predictions, with important implications for management. For example, \nmanagement that aims to minimise the risk of particular outcomes or to be robust to \nuncertainty might require very different management actions as the perceived level of \nuncertainty changes. Fishery modellers and managers must therefore be well-\nequipped to deal with the various uncertainties that can influence model predictions. \nOur aim is to review approaches to model uncertainty and suggest practical ways to \ndeal with it in developing the EAF. In the next section we define model uncertainty \nand highlight its importance in ecosystem dynamics models. In the following sections, \nwe review approaches for addressing model uncertainty, including approaches \n 5\nadopted in other disciplines attempting to make predictions about complex systems. \nFinally we discuss the presentation of results that incorporate uncertainty, pragmatic \napproaches to dealing with model uncertainty in the short term, and strategies for \nreducing model uncertainty over the longer term. \n \nModel uncertainty in ecosystem dynamics models. \nThere are many sources of uncertainty in resource dynamics models, and these \nhave been classified in various ways by Francis and Shotton (1997), Charles (1998), \nReagan et al. (2002), Harwood and Stokes (2003) and Mangel (2006). Our focus is on \n\u201cmodel uncertainty\u201d which arises because any single, apparently satisfactory, model \ncan be misleading. For example, Fig. 1 shows a linear model relating recruitment of a \ncommercially exploited fish species to sea-surface temperature.  The model predicts \nnegative recruitment at temperatures below 2\u02daC (Hill et al. 2005) and is clearly \nunsuitable for predicting the response to temperatures beyond a limited range. \nAlthough model uncertainty largely concerns model structure, it can also include \nuncertainties about the values of parameters that determine a model\u2019s behaviour, but \nare not easily estimated. For example, the parameter M in Virtual Population Analysis \n(VPA) attempts to summarise all the sources of natural mortality. In contrast, \nmultispecies VPA estimates predation mortality due to other modelled species and \ntherefore relaxes the assumptions inherent in the value of this parameter (see \nMagn\u00fasson 1995). Other models are formulated so that their behaviour can be \nchanged by altering a key parameter (such as a shape parameter in a functional \nrelationship; Yodzis 1994). Model uncertainty also overlaps with process uncertainty \nas it can also concern the shape of the error distribution (e.g. normal versus \nlognormal; Halley and Inchausti 2002).  \n 6\nModels are mathematical abstractions of non-mathematical processes and there \nwill be uncertainty about whether a given model structure is an appropriate \nrepresentation of a real system. According to Patterson et al. (2001), fisheries \nscientists must give \u201cmore attention \u2026 to examining the sensitivity to alternative \nassumptions and model structures.\u201d Predictive models, especially in ecology, are \nrarely intended to provide an all encompassing description of how a system actually \nworks, but they are intended to forecast how certain characteristics of the system \nrespond to specific sets of conditions. It is therefore less important that a model is \nexactly \u201cright\u201d about how a system functions than that it captures the responses of \ninterest.  Importantly, it must do this for the range of plausible input values.  \nThere are numerous models that aim to predict the dynamics of exploited marine \necosystems. Plag\u00e1nyi (in press) reviews twenty such models that, in order of \ndecreasing complexity, are broadly categorized as 1) \u201cwhole ecosystem models\u201d that \nattempt to account for all trophic levels, e.g., Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE: Christensen \nand Walters 2004); 2) \u201cdynamic system models\u201d that represent both bottom-up and \ntop-down processes, e.g., \u201cBay Model 2\u201d (Fulton et al. 2004); 3) \u201cdynamic multi-\nspecies models\u201d (also known as \u201cminimally realistic models\u201d) that represent a limited \nnumber of species with important interactions, e.g., GADGET \n(http:\/\/www.hafro.is\/gadget, accessed 19th March 2007); and 4) \u201cextended single-\nspecies assessment models\u201d that take a few interactions into account, for example by \ntreating predators as additional fisheries (e.g. Hollowed et al. 2000).   \nUltimately, all ecosystem dynamics models simplify the structure of the food-web, \nthe nature of ecological interactions, and the demographic structure of populations. \nPredictions arising from such models are likely to be particularly uncertain. The \ncomplexity of the systems leads to complexity in models and a plethora of potential \n 7\nassumptions, but there are often insufficient data to evaluate models of high \ncomplexity. However, as Plag\u00e1nyi (in press) notes, the treatment of uncertainty in \nsuch models \u201chas lagged unsatisfactorily behind other aspects of model development\u201d \nA number of applications using EwE exemplify the consequences of model \nuncertainty in ecosystem modeling. Mackinson et al. (2003) showed how six \nalternative hypotheses about the functional response of cetaceans to variations in the \navailability of their main prey led to different outcomes under simulated harvest \nregimes for both the cetaceans and the prey.  Watters et al. (2003) explored how a \npelagic ecosystem might respond to climate forcing under two different hypotheses of \nhow physical and ecological processes in the system are linked.  Both studies \nidentified results that were robust to the alternative hypotheses and others that were \nsensitive. For example, Mackinson et al. (2003) found that intense fishing on the prey \nalways had a longer lasting, negative impact on cetaceans than direct removals of \ncetaceans themselves, while depleted cetacean populations recovered more slowly as \nlimitations to foraging were increased. Watters et al. (2003) found that climate trends \nalways caused trends in the biomasses of animals at middle and upper trophic levels \nbut that the direction of trends was sensitive to the alternative hypotheses.  Pinnegar et \nal. (2005) used EwE to explore the implications of nine alternative models of the \nsame food-web that differed in the number of functional groups included and which \nweak predator-prey links were considered in the model. They showed that Ecosim \npredictions about food-web responses to, and recoveries from, intense pulses of \nfishing mortality are very sensitive to model complexity and \u201ctaxonomic bias\u201d (where \nfunctional groups are aggregated or disaggregated on the basis of particular interest in \nmammals, fishes, or invertebrates).   \n 8\nThe developers of widely distributed software packages for ecosystem modelling \nhave included functionality that allows some uncertainties to be addressed. For \nexample, EwE includes the Ecoranger routine to find alternative parameter \ncombinations that satisfy Ecopath\u2019s mass-balance assumptions, and the sensitivity of \nEcosim models to initial biomass estimates can be assessed using Monte Carlo \nsimulation (Christensen and Walters 2004). GADGET allows the analyst to select and \ncompare different forms of key functions (Begley 2005).  Despite the availability of \nsuch tools, the practice of considering model uncertainty in implemented ecosystem \nmodels appears to be relatively rare. \n \nApproaches to Uncertainty I: Adaptive management \nAdaptive or experimental management seeks to reduce uncertainty through \nexperimentation. This approach identifies candidate management actions, which are \nthen implemented as experimental treatments in the exploited system (Walters and \nHilborn 1976). The role of alternative structural models in this approach is to identify \nappropriate management actions and to represent the alterative hypotheses about the \nsystem. It is not necessary to fully characterize uncertainty in model predictions, just \nto determine whether a candidate management action could credibly achieve the \ndesired management objectives given plausible hypotheses about the operation of the \nsystem. The credibility of alternative hypotheses is determined through the analysis of \nexperimental results. Examples of experimental management suggest that it will not \ncompletely eliminate model uncertainty, and Walters and Martell (2004), who discuss \nthe use of adaptive management in EAF in detail, conclude that the risks and \ninvestment involved make it economically or socially unacceptable in many cases. \nFurthermore, adaptive management cannot easily consider the full range of uncertain \n 9\nprocesses (e.g. climate change and regime shift). Nevertheless, in some cases, \nadaptive approaches can help to weight hypotheses, thus improving the \ncharacterization of uncertainty. We provide two examples of this (Sainsbury 1988; \nSainsbury et al. 1997; McAllister and Kirchner 2002) in a later section.  \nApproaches to Uncertainty II: Robust Management \nA pragmatic approach to uncertainty in general, that is particularly relevant to \nmodel uncertainty, is to identify management actions that perform adequately \n(robustly) across the plausible range of ecosystem structures and parameter values \n(e.g. Ludwig et al. 1993; Charles 1998). The shift in focus from identifying \u201coptimal\u201d \nmanagement actions, as implied by concepts such as maximum sustainable yield \n(MSY), to \u201cadequate\u201d management actions acknowledges both the trade-offs and the \nuncertainties that are inherent in managing complex systems. It is unlikely that all \npossible management objectives (e.g. profitability, social benefits and the potentially \nconflicting requirements of different natural components of the ecosystem) can be \noptimised simultaneously or that all model structures would suggest the same \noptimum.  \nThe concept of robust management is embodied in Operational Management \nProcedures (OMPs: Kell et al. 2006). This approach, as defined by Punt and Donovan \n(in press), has seven distinct steps:   \n1. Identify and prioritize the management objectives (usually specified in \nnational and international laws, standards and agreements) in qualitative \nterms.  \n2. Translate these qualitative objectives into quantitative performance measures. \nThe number of performance measures should be kept small. Miller (1956) \n 10\nsuggested that the human mind might be able to simultaneously compare no \nmore than about seven pieces of information. Our own experience is that when \ndecision makers are confronted with a large number of performance measures \nthey tend to focus on a small number of \u201cimportant\u201d ones anyway. Therefore \nseven seems to be a reasonable upper limit for the number of performance \nmeasures that we can expect to be given equal consideration. \n3. Develop and parameterize \u2018operating\u2019 models representing plausible dynamics \nof the resource or system. Model uncertainty is dealt with by including \nalternative structural assumptions in the set of operating models. \n4. Identify candidate management procedures (rules for analyzing data and \ndetermining management actions) and monitoring strategies. \n5. Simulate the future performance of each management procedure by applying it \nto the resources or systems represented in the operating models.  \n6. Summarize the performance of each management procedure in terms of the \nperformance measures identified in step 2. \n7. Identify the management procedure most likely to meet the management \nobjectives. \nThe OMP approach is exemplified by the development of the International Whaling \nCommission\u2019s (IWC\u2019s) management procedures for whale stocks. These management \nprocedures are based on single-species population dynamics models, but they were \ntested using operating models that considered some of the effects of ecosystem \nvariability. More recently, the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine \nLiving Resource (CCAMLR) has begun a programme of work to identify \nmanagement procedures for aspects of the management of krill that are robust to \n 11\nuncertainties about the current status of the krill stock and its interactions with \npredators and the fishery. This section explores these two cases in more detail. \nThe CCAMLR approach \nThe CCAMLR is responsible for managing fisheries in the Southern Ocean. Its \nobjectives include facilitating the \u201crational use\u201d of marine resources; the maintenance \nof harvested populations at levels that ensure stable recruitment; the restoration of \ndepleted species to these levels; the maintenance of ecological relationships between \nharvested, dependent and related species; and the prevention of changes to the \necosystem that are not potentially reversible within two to three decades (Constable et \nal. 2000). The last two objectives are the basis for an EAF.  \nThe CCAMLR\u2019s implementation of an EAF in its main fishery for Antarctic krill \n(Euphausia superba, Euphausiidae) includes setting precautionary catch limits \nintended to account for the needs of predators, and the development of a monitoring \nprogramme that uses krill predators to detect the effects of the fishery (Constable \n2004).  Precautionary catch limits are determined for, and applied to, large areas \ndesigned for reporting catch statistics (e.g., FAO Statistical Subareas). In addition, the \nCCAMLR recognises the need to subdivide the precautionary krill catch limit for the \nScotia Sea-Antarctic Peninsula region among small-scale management units (SSMUs) \nto minimise possible local effects on krill predators (Hewitt et al. 2004a). At present \nthe effects of krill harvesting on krill predators cannot be quantified since current \ncatches are relatively small compared to the precautionary limit, with no observed \neffects. It is therefore particularly important to account for model uncertainty when \nevaluating ways to subdivide the full krill catch limit. The CCAMLR has adopted \nvarious principles of the OMP approach in its ongoing work to address this problem. \nA number of operating models have been developed and demonstrated, but the \n 12\nquantification of management objectives is incomplete. Furthermore, the candidate \nmanagement actions being considered at present are not management procedures as \ngenerally understood (i.e., regular stock assessments that are used to revise catch or \neffort limits according to a harvest control rule). Rather, they are options for \nsubdividing a catch limit estimated from a separate stock assessment (e.g., Hewitt et \nal. 2004b). However regular reassessments of the data used to provide the basis for \nsuch subdivisions are being actively considered.   \nAt a recent CCAMLR workshop, two ecosystem dynamics models (with \nacronyms KPFM and SMOM) were used to evaluate six candidate options (see Hewitt \net al. 2004a) for subdividing the precautionary krill catch limit in the Scotia Sea-\nAntarctic Peninsula region (SC-CAMLR 2006; Plag\u00e1nyi in press). The evaluations \nconsidered potential effects on the krill stock, predator populations breeding within \nSSMUs, and fishery performance. Both models represented the krill population and \nseveral predator populations in each SSMU, as well as the movement of krill among \nSSMUs. There were, however, important differences between the KPFM and SMOM, \nincluding the number of predator populations explicitly modelled in each SSMU, the \nmain source of stochasticity in the system, the mechanism by which krill availability \naffects predator dynamics, and the nature of competition among predator species.  The \nworkshop explored three key sources of uncertainty: the functional relationship \nbetween krill availability and predator breeding success; the relative influence, on \nkrill dynamics, of advection (both among SSMUs and from outside them) versus local \nproduction; and the juvenile and adult survival rates of predators.  In all three cases, \nthe workshop agreed on plausible bounds to these uncertainties. \nThe two models addressed the three sources of uncertainty between them, \nalthough neither model was formulated to deal with all three simultaneously at the \n 13\ntime of the workshop.  With SMOM, the focus was on the 1st and 3rd sources of \nuncertainty, and a \u201creference set\u201d of parameters consisting of 3 (lowest plausible \nvalue, average value, highest plausible value) * N (number of predator taxa) * P \n(number of uncertain parameters) parameter combinations was used. With KPFM, the \nfocus was on the 1st and 2nd sources of uncertainty, and four parameter combinations, \nrepresenting each combination of high versus low transport rates (Hill et al. in press) \nand high versus low sensitivity to krill availability in all predator populations, were \nused. Multiple stochastic simulations (e.g., to include recruitment variability) using \neach parameter combination were performed with both models. The output included \ntrajectories of abundance for each modelled population in each SSMU for each model \nrun. These were plotted either as individual trajectories (Fig. 2) or as 95% probability \nenvelopes. These plots indicate the range of plausible outcomes, but not the \nprobability of any particular outcome.  It is possible that more extreme results would \nhave arisen from combinations of high and low settings not considered in these \nsimulations. The use of \u201creference sets\u201d allows a comprehensive evaluation of \nmultiple parameter combinations, but could easily generate high numbers of \nparameter combinations (for example, in this case the values for the these parameters \nfor up to 47 predator populations could be allowed to vary independently). Ultimately, \nthe workshop made compromises between a comprehensive evaluation and \npracticality. \nModel output was also presented in terms of trade-off plots showing fisheries \nperformance versus ecosystem performance for each SSMU (e.g., Fig. 3). These plots \nwere generated for a range of performance measures including the mean catch, the \nspatial distribution of the catch relative to its historical distribution, and the species-\nspecific probability of depletion below or recovery to above predefined thresholds.  \n 14\nAlthough no attempt has been made to date to quantify the probabilities of alternative \nmodels, the approach taken nevertheless allows decision makers to evaluate the trade-\noffs among potential outcomes.   \nCCAMLR has not yet completed this work programme and no management \ndecisions have been made on the basis of ecosystem dynamics models. Indeed, the \nfinal set of performance measures is yet to be agreed, and there are likely to be other \nplausible models of the system and other important sources of uncertainty. However, \nthis workshop demonstrated some important principles for dealing with model \nuncertainty, namely: \n1. the formulation of models so that different assumptions about ecosystem \nstructure can be represented through different parameterisations of the same \nmodel;  \n2. the parsimonious attempt to bracket major uncertainties with parameters \nrepresenting the extreme cases;  \n3. the use of stochastic simulations to capture other sources of uncertainty (e.g., \nrecruitment variability); and  \n4. the use of more than one basic operating model. \n \n \nThe IWC approach \nThe IWC is responsible for the management of commercial and subsistence \nwhaling worldwide. Its objectives for commercial whaling are to ensure that the risks \nof extinction to individual stocks are not seriously increased by exploitation, and to \nmaintain the status of stocks to allow the highest continuing yield as long as the \nenvironment permits (IWC, 1981). The IWC\u2019s current approach for commercial \n 15\nwhaling, known as the \u2018Revised Management Procedure\u2019 (RMP), was developed \nfollowing the \u2018moratorium\u2019 on commercial whaling that took effect in 1986. The full \nmanagement system (the \u2018Revised Management System\u2019, RMS) consists of three \ncomponents: (a) a generic management procedure that could be applied to any baleen \nwhale population with known stock structure (referred to as the \u2018Catch Limit \nAlgorithm\u2019, CLA), (b) the rules used to handle situations in which stock structure is \nuncertain (which constitute the RMP), and (c) other non-scientific issues such as \nenforcement. The CLA is conservative in the face of uncertainty because it prohibits \nthe harvesting of stocks below 54% of the estimated pre-exploitation level, and \nbecause it determines the catch limit as the lower 40.2th percentile of a posterior \ndistribution. Increased uncertainty therefore leads to lower catch limits. \nBoth generic and case-specific simulation trials have been used by the IWC\u2019s \nScientific Committee. During the development of the RMP, simulations based on a \n\u201cgeneric\u201d baleen whale stock examined a range of uncertainties. The aim of these \nsimulations was to ensure that the performance of the RMP would be \u2018adequate\u2019 (in \nterms of the trade-off between extinction risk and long-term catch) irrespective of the \ntrue dynamics of the population being managed. Although the CLA and RMP are \ngeneric and can, in principle, be applied to any stock of baleen whales harvested on \ntheir feeding grounds application of the RMP requires that case-specific \n(implementation) simulation trials be developed to ensure that performance is \nadequate for the uncertainties most relevant to each case. The process developed by \nIWC (2005a) to interpret the results of case-specific trials assigns \u201cplausibility \nweights\u201d to each of these trials (see next section). A management action (a variant of \nthe RMP related to how catches are allocated spatially) is then selected so that \n 16\nconservation performance is adequate on all simulation trials considered to have \n\u2018high\u2019 plausibility. \nOperating models have been developed to consider a wide range of uncertainties \n(e.g. IWC 1992; Punt and Donovan in press), arguably more so than for any other \nmarine renewable resource; examples are provided in the following list. \n1. Bias in the assessment model on which the CLA is based. Bias arises because the \nassessment model is structurally different from the operating models (the model \nunderlying the CLA is age- and sex-aggregated, while the operating models are \nage-, sex- and occasionally spatially-structured). Furthermore, the estimates of \nabundance used by the CLA, usually from scientific surveys, are sometimes made \nto be biased in simulations, and this bias may change over time. \n2. Changes over time in biological parameters. Simulation trials have been used to \nexamine the implications of carrying capacity and productivity increasing and \ndecreasing over time, in part to mimic the implications of climate change and \necosystem shifts. The CLA assumes that carrying capacity and productivity are \ntime-invariant.  \n3. Episodic events. Simulation trials have been used to examine the implications of \nlarge-scale increases in natural mortality that occur, on average, once every 50 \nyears. Half of the population is assumed to die when such an event occurs. \nPerhaps the major source of model uncertainty considered during the development \nof the RMP relates to the case-specific \u2018implementation\u2019 trials constructed to ensure \nthat performance is adequate for a given species in a region (generally a part of an \nocean basin such as the western North Pacific). To date, implementation trials have \nbeen developed for southern minke whales (Balaenoptera bonaerensis, \nBalaenopteridae), northern minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata, \n 17\nBalaenopteridae) in the western North Pacific and the North Atlantic, and Bryde\u2019s \nwhales (Balaenoptera brydei, Balaenopteridae) in the western North Pacific. In \ncontrast to the generic simulation trials used when developing the RMP, most of the \nparameters of the operating models used in \u2018implementation\u2019 trials are estimated by \nfitting the operating models to the actual data for the species and region concerned, \nand the models are spatially-structured.  \nThe approach outlined above was also applied to develop \u2018Strike Limit \nAlgorithms\u2019 (SLAs) for aboriginal subsistence whaling. To date SLAs, have been \ndeveloped for the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas stock of bowhead whales (Balaena \nmysticetus, Balaenidae) and the Eastern North Pacific stock of grey whales \n(Eschrichtius robustus, Eschrichtiidae) (IWC 2003, 2005b). Although, technically, the \nway SLAs were selected for these two cases was the same as for commercial whaling, \nthere were some notable conceptual differences. For example, only case-specific trials \nwere used for the aboriginal whaling case. This is because there are only a small \nnumber of aboriginal subsistence operations identified by the IWC, and it is unlikely \nthat more will be \u2018accepted\u2019 (Punt and Donovan in press), and because the objectives \nfor aboriginal subsistence whaling (\u2018need satisfaction\u2019) differ from those for \ncommercial whaling (\u2018catch maximization\u2019). \nThe approach developed by the IWC Scientific Committee has been applied \nelsewhere. In South Africa, the approach has been adopted in totality and \nmanagement procedures have been developed for the hake, anchovy, pilchard and \nrock lobster resources (e.g. Geromont et al. 1999). These management procedures \nprescribe how the data on which scientific management advice is to be based must be \ncollected and analysed, and how Total Allowable Catches are to be determined from \nthose analyses. In contrast to the situation in South Africa, the process of simulating \n 18\nthe performance of management procedures has been used in other countries, such as \nAustralia, to guide the selection of the assessment methods that are most likely to \nprovide robust, accurate and precise estimates of the quantities of interest to \nmanagement (Punt 2006; Punt et al. 2002). \nSimilarities and differences \nFor both the IWC and CCAMLR cases, the key outputs from the analyses are \nbased on different models related to trade-offs between conservation- and use-related \nobjectives.  The IWC used an initial set of simulations to identify a generic RMP that \nis robust to a range of uncertainties, followed by more specific simulations to \nestablish the trade-offs associated with uncertainties about stock structure and \ntherefore to identify variants of the generic RMP that perform adequately for specific \nregions and species. The CCAMLR sets regional krill catch limits with a \nprecautionary single species model and is using ecosystem dynamics models to \nidentify robust ways of subdividing this limit. However, while the IWC has attempted \nto assign weights to alternative structural assumptions when selecting among RMP \nvariants, the CCAMLR\u2019s approach has been to bracket uncertainty. The former \napproach allows a quasi-quantitative assessment of risk whereas the latter is less \ninformative and perhaps better suited to eliminating management actions that are \nlikely to perform poorly than to choosing between better performing candidates. \nApproaches to Uncertainty III: Model Weighting \nIt is difficult, but useful and arguably necessary, to quantify the plausibility of a \nmodel relative to others, particularly if those models have markedly different \nimplications. Butterworth et al. (1996) proposed the following four-level scheme to \nassign \u201cplausibility ranks\u201d to the hypotheses underlying alternative models: \n 19\n1. how strong is the basis for the hypothesis in the data for the species or region \nunder consideration; \n2. how strong is the basis for the hypothesis in the data for a similar species or \nanother region; \n3. how strong is the basis for the hypothesis for any species; and \n4. how strong or appropriate is the theoretical basis for the hypothesis? \nThis scheme was presented to the IWC Scientific Committee.  Although the scheme \nprovides a formal structure within which to assign weights to models, it has not been \nused, largely because of concerns regarding the validity of the likelihood functions \nthat are needed to apply the first level of the scheme.  Instead, the Committee has used \na less rigorous approach, involving a \u201cDelphi method\u201d (e.g., Linstone and Turoff \n1975), in which the Committee assigns a plausibility ranking of \u201chigh\u201d, \u201cmedium\u201d, \n\u201clow\u201d, or \u201cno agreement\u201d (\u201cno agreement\u201d being treated as \u201cmedium\u201d, IWC 2005a) to \nmodels.   \nIf a valid likelihood function can be constructed (i.e., level one of the above \nscheme), the Bayesian approach is well suited to assigning weights to alternative \nmodels that use the same data. In Bayesian statistics, unobservable quantities are \ntreated as random variables, and Bayes\u2019 theorem or rule (see below) is used to define \nprobability density functions for the model parameters. These probability density \nfunctions convey the plausibility or degree of support for particular parameter values. \nUnobservable, discrete items such as alternative scientific hypotheses can also be \ntreated as random variables. Bayesian probabilities can therefore be calculated for \nalternative scientific hypotheses whereby the probability reflects the plausibility of a \nhypothesis relative to one or more alternatives (Patterson 1999; McAllister and \nKirchner 2002; Parma 2002).   \n 20\nThe posterior probability specified by Bayes theorem or rule is directly \nproportional to the product of the prior probability for the hypothesis, and the \nprobability of obtaining the observed data presuming that the hypothesis is true, i.e.:   \n \n( ) ( ) ( )  trueis  assuming Prob  ProbPrior   ProbPosterior HHH D\u00d7\u221d , \n \nwhere H is a hypothesis and D is a set of observed data. The prior probability reflects \nthe credibility of H relative to its alternatives before evaluating the probability of the \ndata given the hypothesis. Prior probabilities may be formulated on the basis of expert \njudgment or the analysis of other relevant datasets that are not included in the term \nwhich indicates the probability of observing D (Punt and Hilborn 1997). The \nprobability of observing D given H typically has the same mathematical form as the \nlikelihood function. The Bayes factor (Kass and Raftery 1995): \n \n( )\n( )  trueis  assuming Prob\n trueis  assuming Prob factor  Bayes\n2\n1\nH\nH\nD\nD=  \nis one way of evaluating the credibility of hypothesis H1 relative to that of alternative \nhypothesis H2 (e.g. Brodziak and Legault, 2005). \nThe probabilistic weighting of hypotheses provided by Bayes\u2019 rule provides a \nframework that has been applied to decision problems in fisheries management, \nparticularly in attempts to deal with model uncertainty (Walters and Hilborn 1978; \nSainsbury 1988; McAllister et al. 1994; McAllister and Kirchner 2002).  The steps \nneeded to apply this framework to decision analytic problems parallel those of the \nOMP approach and are as follows (see McAllister et al. 1999 for further details). \n1.  Identify the management objectives. \n 21\n2.  Formulate a set of decision options. \n3. Formulate a small number of quantitative performance measures to evaluate \nthe extent to which the objectives are met  \n4.  Formulate alternative hypotheses for system behaviour (see next section for \nexamples). \n5.  Use Bayes\u2019 rule to compute probabilities for each alternative hypothesis \nformulated in Step 4 and for their (uncertain) parameters. \n6. Evaluate the potential consequences of implementing each decision option in \nterms of the performance measures. This evaluation is done using the \nalternative models and posterior probability density functions for parameters \nin these alternatives. Thus, for each decision option evaluated, a posterior \nprobability distribution of outcomes should be computed for each of the \nperformance measures. \n7.  Summarize the results obtained in Step 6 for the purpose of conveying them to \ndecision makers (e.g., in decision tables, Hilborn et al. 1993; McAllister and \nKirchner 2002). Typically, this would show the potential outcomes of each \ndecision option under each alternative hypothesis and the probability assigned \nto each hypothesis, thus providing an objective method to weight the results \nobtained under each hypothesis.  \nThere are other approaches for weighting models including information-theoretic \ncriteria such as Akaike weights.  Also, pattern oriented modelling (POM) has been \npromoted as a way of developing plausible models of complex systems (Grimm and \nBerger 2004; Grimm et al. 2005; Grimm and Railsback 2005). Most applications of \nPOM make use of agent-based models, which are not widely used for modelling \nexploited marine ecosystems (but see Shin and Cury 2001; Shin et al. 2004). \n 22\nHowever, the principles of POM can be applied more generally. POM seeks to \nreplicate the characteristic patterns of observed systems at a range of scales and \nhierarchical levels. The plausibility of models is judged against their ability to capture \nthe full set of \u201cessential\u201d patterns of a system in the most parsimonious way, and their \nability to predict secondary characteristics of the system that were not explicitly \nconsidered in model formulation (Grimm and Railsback 2005). This approach is data \nintensive, requiring sufficient observations to establish the characteristic patterns at a \nrange of scales. While it has not been used to weight models, the principles imply that \nmodels could be weighted on a combination of model simplicity, the degree of pattern \nreplication, and the extent to which replicated patterns are considered characteristic of \nthe observed system. \nWeighting alternative models leads to consideration of model averaging, where \nthe weights determine how much each alternative model contributes to the overall \nexpectation. Burnham and Anderson (1998) recommend model averaging when the \ngoal of an analysis is to \u201cget the best set of parameters in common to all models\u201d but \nthey caution against such averaging if the competing models lead to \u201cdefinite, and \ndiffering, interpretations.\u201d Such caution is particularly important if the competing \nmodels imply different strategies and tactics for achieving a set of management \nobjectives.  \nApplications of the Bayesian approach to weight alternative models \nThere are a number of examples in which Bayesian methods have been used to \nassign plausibility weights to alternative models in fishery management problems. \nThese mainly concern single-species stock dynamics. However, one of the earliest \nexamples (Sainsbury 1988; Sainsbury et al. 1997) attempted to distinguish among \ncompeting models of the interactions between harvesting and fish community \n 23\nstructure. Following intensive pair trawl fishing on the northwest shelf of Australia \nsince the 1960s, the abundance of the two most commercially valuable species had \ndeclined considerably by the mid 1980s while that of two low value species had \nincreased. The Bayesian approach was applied to evaluate the probability of four \nalternative models which explained the changes in terms of: (a) fishing and no species \ninteractions, (b) fishing and the less valuable species negatively impacting the more \nvaluable species, (c) fishing and the more valuable species negatively impacting the \nless valuable species, or (d) fishing causing reductions in habitat for the more valuable \nspecies and increases in habitat for the less valuable species. The two best-supported \nmodels were approximately equally probable given the available data in the mid-\n1980s (Sainsbury 1988), and an experimental fisheries management regime was \nimplemented in the late 1980s based on the results of a decision analysis that \nconsidered yield of information and economic value as performance measures.  The \nexperimental regime was not strictly implemented, but, by 1990, it appeared that the \nhabitat modification hypothesis was most probable (Sainsbury et al. 1997; Table 1). \nData collected in the 1990s provided further support for this hypothesis (Sainsbury, \npers. comm.). The results suggested that trap fishing should replace trawling to \nachieve a recovery in fish community structure and the fishery for the more valuable \nspecies.  \nMichielsens and McAllister (2004) used Bayesian hierarchical modelling to \njointly analyse stock-recruitment datasets for several Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar, \nSalmonidae) populations and extrapolate the results to Baltic stocks for which such \ndata were unavailable. These analyses evaluated the central tendency and cross-stock \nvariance in the steepness parameter of the stock-recruitment relationship, and \nconsidered Beverton-Holt and Ricker models as alternative stock-recruit functions. In \n 24\nsubsequent population dynamic modelling of Baltic salmon stocks, the posterior \nprobabilities for the two alternative stock-recruit models have been used as priors.  \nBecause the posterior for the Beverton-Holt model was much higher (i.e., 0.999) only \nthis model has been applied to provide management advice (ICES 2004; 2006).  The \nposterior median for steepness in the Beverton-Holt model was considerably less than \nthat in the Ricker model (i.e., 0.72 vs. 1.15) (Michielsens and McAllister 2004). The \napplication of these model weightings supported lower exploitation rates than might \nhave been the case if the analysis had not been performed and both models were \nassumed to be equally likely by default. \nBrodziak and Legault (2005) considered twelve alternative stock-recruitment \nmodels for each of three overfished groundfish stocks. These models differed in terms \nof functional form (Beverton-Holt versus Ricker), error structure, and the nature of \nprior information. An approximation to the Bayes\u2019 factor (Kass and Raftery 1995) \nwas used to compute weights for each model. Finally, weighted averages for each \nstock were calculated using only those models that provided identifiable parameters. \nThis restriction excluded most of the Ricker models and all Beverton-Holt models \nwithout prior information on unfished recruitment levels. The models that were \nincluded in the average for each stock generally provided similar estimates of the \nspawning biomass and fishing mortality rates that produce MSY, and, therefore, the \naveraged estimates appeared to usefully account for model uncertainty (Table 2).  \nNevertheless, Brodziak and Legault (2005) acknowledged that the results, in terms of \nfishing mortalities, were sensitive to the prior mean assumed for the steepness \nparameter, which was not varied in the study. It is not clear whether model averaging \nwould have been appropriate had the prior mean been varied. \n 25\nBrandon and Wade (2006) also used Bayes\u2019 factors to assign plausibility weights \nto: (a) a model of the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas bowhead whale stock that \ninitiates projections from an equilibrium in 1848 and assumes that carrying capacity \nand the parameters of the density-dependence function have not changed over time, \nand that the historical catches are known without error (e.g. Punt and Butterworth, \n1999), (b) a density-dependent model that started the population projection in 1978, \nand (c) a density-independent model that started the population projection in 1978. \nAlthough the density-independent model was assigned the highest posterior \nprobability, none of the three models could be considered implausible (e.g., using \ncriteria developed by Jefferys 1961 and Kass and Raftery 1995). Brandon and Wade \n(2006) used the results of their analyses to construct model-averaged posterior \ndistributions for key model outputs. As expected, the posterior distributions calculated \nusing model-averaging indicated greater uncertainty than the posterior distributions \nbased on the model that had the highest posterior probability. \nMcAllister and Kirchner (2002) computed posterior probabilities for four models \nattributing a decline in orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus, Trachichthyidae) \ncatches off Namibia to (a) fishery removals (b) temporary events unrelated to the \nfishery, (c) temporary dispersal triggered by fishing, and (d) long-term dispersal. \nRather than providing relatively precise unimodal distributions for stock biomass, the \ninitially equally probable alternative models resulted in bimodal marginal posterior \ndistributions indicating that, overall, the stock was either heavily depleted or lightly \nfished (McAllister and Kirchner 2002). The posterior probabilities for the four \nalternative models were used in a Bayesian decision analysis to evaluate the potential \nconsequences of various fisheries management options (Table 3). When considered \nacross the four hypotheses, the chance of recovery without a major reduction in \n 26\nfishing effort was found to be very low, and the Namibian Minister of Fisheries \nconsequently lowered the catch quotas on all fishing grounds considerably. A few \nyears after one fishing ground was closed altogether, monitoring detected a major re-\naggregation of fish on the closed ground only (C. Kirchner pers. comm.), indicating \nthat the apparent decline may have been, at least partly, due to temporary dispersal of \nthe fish stocks in response to intensive fishing.   \nPatterson (1999) presented a method for integrating VPA-based stock assessment, \nreference point estimation, and management simulation using Bayesian methods to \ncompute posterior distributions for parameters, and posterior probabilities for \nalternative model structures. The model structures considered were the stock-\nrecruitment function (Beverton-Holt versus Ricker) and the shape of the observation \nerror distribution for surveys (normal, lognormal or gamma). For Norwegian spring-\nspawning herring (Clupea harengus, Clupeidae), this process indicated high posterior \nsupport for the normal error distribution model, but was unable to distinguish between \nthe stock-recruitment functions. Nonetheless, all alternative models were included in \nthe assessment and management simulation processes weighted by their posterior \nprobabilities. Patterson (1999) found that the uncertainty resulting from the inclusion \nof three error models (Fig. 4) was greater than that suggested by an ad-hoc \ncomparison of the results from individual parametric bootstraps using each error \ndistribution. \nApproaches to model uncertainty IV: Examples from related disciplines \nIn this section we consider approaches used to address model uncertainty in \nweather forecasting, climate prediction and ocean biogeochemistry. These disciplines \nalso use models to make predictions about complex systems and must account for \nuncertainties arising from simplifications about processes and scale, as well as from \n 27\nlimited knowledge about the interactions between processes.  Numerical weather \nprediction (NWP) models represent atmospheric processes and are used to forecast \nthe weather over a period of hours to days ahead (Davies et al. 2005). For predictions \nmore than 10 days ahead, including climate forecasts, it is necessary to use coupled \natmosphere-ocean-sea ice global climate models (GCMs). Ocean biogeochemistry \n(OBGC) models are used primarily to estimate the air-sea fluxes of gases like CO2, \nN2O, or CH4, and biological processes like primary production on time scales from \none to millions of years (e.g. Maier-Reimer 1993; Suntharalingam and Sarmiento \n2000; Carr et al. 2005). OBGC models are based on the conservation of elements in \nthe ocean (e.g. carbon, oxygen, nutrients), which are subject to changes driven by \nphysical, chemical, and biological processes. The elements are also affected by input \nfrom the atmosphere and rivers, and output from sedimentation. \nBoth NWP and OBGC models represent physical processes through the \napplication of the laws of physics to fundamental variables such as temperature, \npressure and density. Uncertainty arises because these fine scale processes are \nmodelled at relatively coarse spatial and temporal scales. For example, atmospheric \nprocesses, such as cumulus clouds, rain showers, and flow over small hills, occur on \nscales well below those of state-of-the-art global NWP models. In OBGC models, \nassumptions about parameters such as vertical diffusivity strongly influence the \nmodelled response of the ocean to changes in the atmospheric concentration of gases \nsuch as anthropogenic CO2. The range of vertical transport rates in different models \nled to a 40% difference in estimated oceanic CO2 uptake in the 1990s (Orr et al. 2001; \nDoney et al. 2004). Further uncertainty arises when the models incorporate processes \nthat are less firmly rooted in fundamental laws of nature. This includes the \nrepresentation of cloud structure and movement in NWP models and biological \n 28\nprocesses in OBGC models. The simplest OBGC models represent only the biological \nprocesses that lead to the export of organic matter to the deep ocean based on the \nsurface nutrient, light, and temperature conditions (e.g. Maier-Reimer 1993). The \nmost complex models cover the range of size and functionality of plankton and \nbacteria in the ocean (e.g. Gregg et al. 2003; Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al. 2005).  \nIt is common practice in weather forecasting and climate prediction to estimate \nuncertainty by considering multiple runs of single models (Bourke et al. 2005) or of \nseveral models that vary in formulation. When these models begin from the same \ninitial state, this is known as the ensemble approach. NWP models differ in a number \nof ways. Some solve the equations of atmospheric motion on a regular grid covering \nthe globe. Others solve them in a \u2018spectral\u2019 form, where the atmospheric variables are \nheld as a number of waves around the Earth. The models also differ in terms of how \nthey handle processes such as clouds, flow over orography, and long and short wave \nradiation in the atmosphere. Ensemble runs of GCMs can provide broad, regional \nguidance on temperature and precipitation for several months ahead (Vialard et al. \n2005). Multi-model ensemble analysis is now a standard feature of climate research, \nand was a key element of the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \n(IPCC) fourth Assessment Report (www.ipcc.ch, accessed 19th March 2007). All \nmembers of the ensemble are subject to the same forcing scenario, such as the set of \ngreenhouse gas emission scenarios used within IPCC. Members of the ensemble may \ndiffer in their formulation, or random noise applied to the initial state, or both. \nDifferent formulations can include or exclude processes such as interactive vegetation \n(Cox et al. 2000). Thus, the ensemble can be used to consider different levels of \nmodel complexity. \n 29\nMeteorologists and climatologists are only just starting to consider how to deal \nwith the output of an ensemble of models. The IPCC has used twenty models to \ninvestigate past climate change and how the climate may evolve in the future. These \nmodels differ in many ways including horizontal resolution and the representation of \nclouds, sea ice, oceans and the inclusion of vegetation. Current estimates of future \nconditions are based on the averaged output of all twenty models with the standard \ndeviation of this estimate used to represent uncertainty (IPCC 2007; Fig. 5). However, \nmore sophisticated means are being considered to deal with the output of so many \nmodels (Mueller et al. 2005). For example, the models can be weighted according to \nhow they represent various elements of the present climate, such as pressure at mean \nsea level or temperature. Alternatively, the models can be weighted according to how \nwell they reproduce aspects of the climate of recent decades. Of course, the ability of \na model to replicate the past may not be a good indicator of how it will deal with \nchanges in the future as a result of different forcing factors, but methods for assessing \nconfidence in climate predictions will be a major focus in future research. \nOcean biogeochemistry models that focus on carbon have been evaluated during \nfour phases of the international Ocean Carbon-cycle Model Intercomparison Project \n(OCMIP). In the earlier phases, models were primarily compared with each other and \nthe first representation of uncertainty was the range of model results (Orr et al. 2001). \nIt was acknowledged at the time that this under-represented uncertainty because the \nprotocols for model comparison restricted the diversity of models considered, and the \nmodels shared common elements that could all have bias in the same direction (e.g. \nthe low resolution of their grids). In later phases, models were compared with a whole \nsuite of observations (Dutay et al. 2002; Doney et al. 2004).  In this case, much of the \ndata collection was triggered by the publication of results from the initial phases of \n 30\nthe model intercomparison. Extreme models were developed to bracket the full \nuncertainty suggested by the observations. For example, the uptake of observed CFCs \nand bomb 14C was clearly overestimated in a model with excessive mixing, and \nunderestimated in one with low mixing (Matsumoto et al. 2004), but these estimates \nusefully define bounds for the uptake of anthropogenic CO2 (Fig. 6). On the other \nhand, it is suspected that uncertainty is greatly under-represented by the existing \nmodels of biological processes (Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al. 2005). The development of biological \nmodels is a very active field of research, with a corresponding focus on producing \nvalidation datasets to define constraints on the biological components (e.g. Rivkin and \nLegendre 2001; Buitenhuis et al. 2006). \nThe OCMIP has demonstrated a community approach to model development and \nevaluation. Model comparison identifies where uncertainties have the greatest effects \non results and coordination ensures that data collection addresses these uncertainties \nand their implications. However, the OCMIP has concentrated on bracketing \nuncertainty because there are limited data with which to assign weights to alternative \nhypotheses (Doney et al. 2004). \nThis summary suggests that other disciplines are at a similar stage as fisheries \nscience in dealing with model uncertainty; it is recognised as an issue and various \napproaches have been developed, although none provides a truly quantitative \ndescription of uncertainty in models of complex systems. The ensemble approach in \nparticular has been recognised as potentially useful in modelling marine ecosystems \n(DeYoung et al. 2004). This approach currently allows the comparison of predictions \narising from a suite of different models which can include differing levels of \ncomplexity. Thus, if output variables are standardized to facilitate comparisons, whole \necosystem models (e.g. Shannon et al. 2004) could be run alongside minimally \n 31\nrealistic models (e.g. Punt and Butterworth 1995). However, more progress is needed \nto ensure that the output is not biased by the choice of ensemble members. \nPresenting results \nWhipple et al. (2000) identified the uncertainty associated with complex \necosystem models as a limitation to their usefulness in management. Yet the \necosystem approach to fisheries implies a willingness to attempt management despite \nthis uncertainty. The communication of model results, and their associated \nuncertainties, to decision makers is a critical step in this process. \nThe OMP and Bayesian decision analytic approaches make it clear that model \npredictions should be presented in terms of performance measures that assess whether \nmanagement objectives have been achieved. Models of complex systems can forecast \nthe dynamics of a plethora of metrics (e.g. Fulton et al. 2005) and produce \noverwhelming amounts of information, especially when the basic outputs are \naccompanied by estimates of uncertainty. Therefore, the performance measures must \nbe limited in number, to around seven. Ideally, these measures should also include \nquantities that can be monitored in the real system so that model results could, in \nprinciple at least, be validated. More detailed results should be made available as \nrequired, but the initial summary, which is all that might be used for decision-making, \nmust be accessible to decision makers.  \nIt is tempting to assume that uncertainty can always be expressed in quantitative \nterms (such as risk, posterior distributions, probability intervals, and critical \npercentiles) and approaches to model uncertainty that include explicit weighting of \nalternative models make this more likely. However, the probabilities suggested by \nthese approaches are not absolute, but relative to the alternatives included in the \nanalysis. Furthermore, different models might favour different management options \n 32\nand presenting results in the form of summary statistics such as averages might be \nmisleading. \nFurther complexities are added when it is not possible to weight models. An \nunweighted set of models gives equal prominence to extreme models, but it could be \ninappropriate to make decisions on the basis of \u2018worst case scenarios\u2019 as this can lead \nto the selection of management actions based on a highly implausible model.  \nButterworth et al. (1996) liken this to refusing to cross the road because of the small, \nbut plausible, risk of being run over. \nGiven these issues, it is imperative that analysts are realistic about the limitations \nof their approaches and present their results as the best use of available knowledge \nrather than as being definitive. Ultimately, making decisions about the management of \ncomplex systems involves risks and trade-offs. The role of models is to facilitate these \nhard decisions by making predictions that emphasise the risks and uncertainties \ninvolved.  \nDiscussion \nLimitations and pragmatic approaches  \nModel uncertainty should be taken into account when predicting the response of \nmarine ecosystems to harvesting. Examples from single species population models \nshow that relying on a single \u2018best model\u2019 under-represents overall uncertainty (e.g. \nPatterson 1999, Brandon and Wade 2006), and recent studies have also demonstrated \nhow predictions from ecosystem models are sensitive to underlying structural \nassumptions (e.g., Mackinson et al. 2003; Watters et al. 2003; Pinnegar et al. 2005). \nIndeed, May (1988) suggests that model construction itself may tell us more about the \npsychology of scientists than about ecology. The ideal is, therefore, to replace implicit \n 33\nand opaque \u201cpsychological\u201d choices about model structures with an explicit and \ntransparent evaluation of the various ways in which the system could behave.  \nPromising approaches to dealing with model uncertainty establish sets of \nalternative models and assign probabilities to each member of the set. These \nprobabilities reflect the credibility or plausibility of one model relative to alternatives \nin the set. Several examples already exist where this has been accomplished using the \nBayesian approach, but even in these cases the initial set of models and assumptions \nabout prior distributions rely on subjective judgement to some extent. Furthermore, \nthe model with the highest posterior support might still be a poor representation of the \nactual system dynamics, and models that were not included could potentially make \nbetter predictions. Other limitations to the Bayesian approach arise because of data \nconstraints and model complexity, and because Bayes\u2019 rule cannot be used to assign \nposterior weights to models that use different data sources.  However, models can be \nweighted by prior probabilities even when the models require different datasets for \nparameter estimation. A relatively simple implementation is to treat alternative \nmodels as random variables in Monte Carlo simulations with the probability of \ninclusion determined by some quantitative or qualitative assessment of apriori \nplausibility (Hill et al. 2006).  \nExisting quantitative approaches to model weighting depend on a model\u2019s ability \nto mimic historical data, which is not necessarily a good indicator of its ability to \npredict the behaviour of the system under potentially different future conditions. For \nexample, if historical stock sizes have been reasonably high, a comparison of models \nwith and without depensation is likely to place greater weight on the simpler model \nthat ignores depensation. However, this may be inappropriate if the analysis considers \nmanagement actions that lead to stock sizes lower than historically observed. Finally, \n 34\ndata limitations are severe for complex ecosystem models. It might never be possible \nto properly weight hypotheses about fishery-ecosystem interactions without data \ncollection in an adaptive management context. \nThe ideal of a completely objective approach and even the use of weighted models \nis constrained by practical difficulties. However, the requirement to implement EAFs \nin the near future, as called for by the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable \nDevelopment, suggests that attention must be given to using current approaches and \nknowledge in pragmatic ways. In our opinion, this requires the use of management \napproaches that can be shown to be robust to uncertainty as well as practical ways of \nassessing uncertainty. Approaches that identify robust management actions are well \nestablished and have been applied in single-species contexts. Implementing such \napproaches in ecosystem contexts will require \u201coperating models\u201d of ecosystem \ndynamics to test the robustness of proposed management actions. To the best of our \nknowledge, the recent CCAMLR workshop represents the only attempt to use \necosystem dynamics models to identify robust management actions. This workshop \ndid not attempt to weight alternative models. However, this is not the same as \nassigning equal weight to all models.  \nWhile the current state-of-the-art is far from the ideal, we cannot ignore model \nuncertainty in developing EAFs. Based on our consideration of fisheries and related \ndisciplines, we believe that the following represents current best practice in \nrepresenting uncertainty in the structural form of models of ecosystem dynamics: \n1. Identify the purpose of the modelling exercise in terms of management \nobjectives, and the performance measures by which the attainment of these \nobjectives will be assessed (including the period of time over which the \nperformance measures are to be calculated). \n 35\n2. Identify the key uncertainties about the system. This should occur during the \nprocess of assembling information and formulating models; it is necessary to \nidentify and highlight uncertainties rather than to make assumptions that \nconstrain the models to a single view of any important process. \n2. Develop models or parameterisations that represent plausible limits to each \nkey uncertainty. Consider more than one basic model structure. \n3. Always include models, assumptions and parameterisations that are not on the \nbounds (and hence may be more plausible), and ensure that the choice of \nmodels, parameter values, and assumptions is balanced given the purpose of \nthe modelling.  For example, McAllister and Kirchner (2002) ensured that two \nmodels implying low current stock abundance of orange roughy were balanced \nby two that implied high current stock abundance but low availability.   \n4. Establish the full range of model behaviours by considering different \ncombinations of models and parameters.  Sensitivity analysis is useful at this \nstage to determine the importance of each source of uncertainty \n5. Consider the interaction between models and data. Specifically, do the models \ncapture the full range of potential conditions, or just the conditions represented \nby the data? If the latter is the case, it may be advisable to consider adopting \nplausible future scenarios that extend outside of the range of historic data, as \nmay occur, for example, under current predictions for climate change. \n6. Ensure that each model is logically consistent. For example, assumptions or \nfixed values for key parameters in an ecosystem model will also need to be \nmade in models used to derive prior density functions for the ecosystem \nmodel\u2019s input parameters. \n 36\n7. Weight models by plausibility if information exists to do this. Ideally this \nweighting would be on the basis of posterior probability, but a more subjective \nweighting by prior probability might be necessary. \n8. Run each model multiple times to incorporate the effects of parameter \nuncertainty and natural variability.  \n9. Avoid averaging model results unless the distribution of results suggested by \nall models is unimodal.  \n10. If it is possible to weight models, present the results in terms of the risk that \neach management objective will not be met. If it is not possible to weight \nmodels, present the results in terms of the trade-offs associated with each \nmanagement action for each alternative model.  \n11. Make sure the assumptions and limitations of the approach are presented along \nwith the results. \nImproving models and establishing protocols \nModels are formalised statements of scientific hypotheses and part of the ongoing \nprocess of improving understanding which, in itself, should eventually reduce \nuncertainty. As the OCMIP demonstrates, model comparisons can help to focus data \ncollection by identifying the areas where model uncertainty has the greatest effect on \npredictions. Sainsbury\u2019s (1988) analysis sparked an experimental fishing regime with \nspatial and temporal replication and contrasting fishing \u201ctreatments.\u201d  Ultimately, this \nexperiment yielded informative data that provided preferential support to one of the \nhypotheses considered in the original study, and implied a management strategy that \nmight achieve the objectives of restoring the fish community structure and recovering \nthe fishery for valuable species.  \n 37\nObservation networks on the scale of those set up to study the Earth system will \nbe of limited use in reducing model uncertainty in resource dynamics models because \nthe spatial and temporal scales of ecosystem dynamics are smaller than whole-Earth \nmodels. Thus observation is best concentrated on local monitoring systems that, over \ntime, can provide feedback with which to refine models and reduce uncertainty. \nHowever, large-scale international coordination within the fisheries science \ncommunity might be useful in defining and refining the general types of models that \nshould be included in a set of alternative models. Specific details of such models will \nrequire expertise about the local system, but global-scale coordination can help to \nensure that the set of models considered when implementing an EAF are balanced and \nnot simply a reflection of localised conventional wisdom. As with the OCMIP, global-\nscale coordination could allow the testing and refinement of general models through \nconfrontation with comparative data collected from multiple systems. This would \nbuild on recent meta-analyses of fisheries data that have produced valuable insights at \nlarge spatial scales (e.g. Liermann and Hilborn 1997; Myers et al. 2001) and could \npotentially facilitate the rapid evaluation of process models such as foraging arena \ntheory (Walters and Martell 2004). \nFinally, we note that model uncertainty is common to most modelling disciplines. \nThere is therefore a need for continued dialogue amongst practitioners in different \nfields. An example of such collaboration is the Ecosystem Modelling Committee \nestablished by the North Pacific Research Board (NPRB). This Committee consists of \nmodellers from a wide range of disciplines and has developed a set of criteria for \nevaluating ecosystem models (http:\/\/doc.nprb.org\/web\/BSIERP\/BSIERP_2007RFP-\nFull-proposals.PDF) based on evaluation techniques from a range of modelling sub-\n 38\ndisciplines. Concordance with these criteria will be used as part of the basis for \nselecting an Integrated Bering Sea Ecosystem Project by the NPRB. \nAcknowledgements \nThis paper is a contribution to the Ocean Ecosystems and Management project in the \nBritish Antarctic Survey\u2019s DISCOVERY 2010 programme.
