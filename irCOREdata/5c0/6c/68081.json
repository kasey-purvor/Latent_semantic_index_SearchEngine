Let p be an odd prime number and G a finite p-group. We prove\nthat if the rank of G is greater than p, then G has no maximal elementary abelian\nsubgroup of rank 2. It follows that if G has rank greater than p, then the poset\nE(G) of elementary abelian subgroups of G of rank at least 2 is connected and the\ntorsion-free rank of the group of endotrivial kG-modules is one, for any field k of\ncharacteristic p. We also verify the class-breadth conjecture for the p-groups G\nwhose poset E(G) has more than one component.\n1. Introduction\nIn this article, we prove the following result, which answers a question raised by\nthe second author in [21, \u00a7 2]:\nTheorem A. Let p be a prime and G be a finite p-group that possesses a maximal\nelementary abelian subgroup E of order p2. Then G has rank at most p if p is odd.\nIn other words, if a finite p-group G for an odd prime p has a maximal elementary\nabelian subgroup of rank 2, then G has no elementary abelian subgroup of rank\np + 1. (Recall that the rank of an elementary abelian group of order pn is n, and\nthat the rank of G is the maximum of the ranks of the elementary abelian subgroups\nof G.)\nSurprisingly, groups satisfying the rather narrow hypothesis of Theorem A appear\nin several different areas of finite group theory. For example, they require a great deal\nof attention as possible \u201csmall\u201d Sylow subgroups in the proof of the Feit-Thompson\nOdd Order Theorem ([9, pp. 453-454]; [8, pp. 845, 903]) and of many subsequent\ntheorems on classifying simple groups ([10, pp. 67-69]). More recently, they have\nbeen important in the study of endotrivial modules in representation theory, as we\nexplain below. Furthermore, in the special case that CG(E) = E, they form part\nof the family of p-groups of maximal class, by a theorem of M. Suzuki ([15, Satz\nIII.14.23]; [2, Proposition 1.8]).\nN. Blackburn studied these groups extensively in [3]. In particular, he noted that\nfor p odd, the centralizer of E in G is a soft subgroup of G, as defined by He\u00b4thelyi\nin [13] (and in Section 2 below). These groups were studied further in [14] and [21].\nThe condition on E in Theorem A suggests that G must be \u201csmall\u201d. Indeed, it is\neasy to show that G cannot possess a normal elementary abelian subgroup of rank\nDate: October 20, 2009.\n1\n2 GEORGE GLAUBERMAN AND NADIA MAZZA\np + 1 (this is a special case of Lemma 2.4(b) below). But what about non-normal\nsubgroups?\nBy considering subgroups of the wreath product Cp o Cp, we see that the rank,\nr, of a group G satisfying the hypothesis of Theorem A can have any of the values\n2, 3, . . . , p. One may show (Remark 3.3) that for p = 2, the values may also be 3 or\n4, but not larger. In contrast, Theorem A shows that if p is odd, the only possible\nvalues are 2, 3, . . . , p.\nFrom Theorem A, we obtain an application to representation theory of arbitrary\nfinite groups. The concepts used in the following statement are explained in Sec-\ntion 3.\nCorollary B. Let p be an odd prime and G\u2217 a finite group having p-rank greater\nthan p. For any field k of characteristic p, the group T (G\u2217) of endotrivial kG\u2217-\nmodules has torsion-free rank one. More precisely, any endotrivial kG\u2217-module is\nisomorphic to a direct summand of a module of the form \u2126n(k)\u2297M , for some integer\nn and some torsion endotrivial module M .\nAs an independent result on p-groups with maximal elementary abelian subgroups\nof rank 2, we end with the proof of the class-breadth conjecture for them ([7]). We\ndefine the poset E(G) in Section 2.\nProposition C. Let p be an odd prime and G a finite p-group. Assume that the\nposet E(G) has more than one component. Then the class-breadth conjecture holds\nfor G.\nThe paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we set the notation and definitions.\nWe also review the necessary background, and show that if a finite p-group G has\na non-normal maximal elementary abelian subgroup of order p2, then G possesses a\nunique normal elementary abelian subgroup of order p2, which is hence characteristic\nin G. In Section 3, we prove Theorem A and Corollary B. We prove Proposition C\nin Section 4.\n2. Generalities: Results old and new\nHenceforth in this paper, p denotes a prime number and G a finite p-group, that\nis, a finite group of order a power of p.\nDefinition 2.1.\n(1) An elementary abelian subgroup of G is an abelian subgroup E of G of expo-\nnent at most p. If |E| = pn, the rank of E is the integer n. Hence, the rank\nof G is the maximum of the ranks of the elementary abelian subgroups of G.\n(2) An elementary abelian subgroup E of G is maximal if E is not properly\ncontained in any larger elementary abelian subgroup of G.\n(3) The elementary abelian subgroups of G of rank at least 2 form a poset E(G)\nfor the order relation given by inclusion.\nNow assume that G has rank at least 2. The groups in Theorem A are important\nbecause the study of simple groups and of endotrivial modules for a finite group is\np-GROUPS WITH MAXIMAL ELEMENTARY ABELIAN SUBGROUPS OF RANK 2 3\nusually much easier when E(G) is connected for a Sylow p-subgroup G. In fact, one\neasily deduces from [10, Lemma 10.21] that E(G) is connected if and only if G has\na unique elementary abelian subgroup of rank 2 or G has no maximal elementary\nabelian subgroups of rank 2.\nAssume p is odd. We refer the reader to [10, \u00a7 10], and especially [10, Lem-\nmas 10.11 and 10.21], for a detailed description of the structure of the poset E(G).\nIn particular, G possesses a normal elementary abelian subgroup E0 of rank 2 and\nif G has rank at least 3, then all the elementary abelian subgroups of G of rank\n3 or more lie in a common connected component of E(G), which contains also a\nnormal elementary abelian subgroup of G of rank 2; the other possible connected\ncomponents are hence isolated vertices, i.e. maximal elementary abelian subgroups\nof rank 2. By Lemma 10.21 and Corollary 10.22 of [10], E(G) is connected if the\nnormal rank of G is greater than p, or if the center of G is not cyclic.\nWe now quote some useful results from [3], [13], [14] and [21]. Let |G| = pn. If\nG has a non-normal maximal elementary abelian subgroup E of rank 2, then E\ndetermines a strictly increasing chain\nE \u2264 N0 < N1 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < Nr\u22121 < Nr = G with |Ni : Ni\u22121| = |G\/Nr\u22121| = p .\nHere, N0 = CG(E) is a soft subgroup of G (as defined in [13], i.e., CG(N0) = N0 and\n|NG(N0)\/N0| = p) of the form Cpn\u2212r \u00d7 Cp, and Ni = NG(Ni\u22121), for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r.\nMoreover, |G : N0| = pr, and Ni has nilpotence class i + 1, for all 0 \u2264 i \u2264 r. A\nstriking fact is that the size of N0 does not depend on the choice of the non-normal\nmaximal elementary subgroup E. Finally, the centralizer CG(E0) of E0 is a maximal\nsubgroup of G, and its intersection H = CG(E0) \u2229 Nr\u22121 is also independent of E\nand thus is a characteristic subgroup of index p2 in G.\nFor the remainder of this paper, we refer the reader to one of the books [2], [11],\nor [15] for the background material and the statements about regular p-groups that\nwe use.\nRemark 2.2. For convenience, we single out the mechanics of the Lazard corre-\nspondence, as we will repeatedly use them. We refer the reader to [18, Chap. 10],\nand in particular to the results stated in 10.11, 10.13 and on p. 124.\nA celebrated theorem of M. Lazard shows that we may define operations + and\n[ , ] on any finite p-group H of nilpotence class less than p, in order to make H into a\nLie ring HL such that every automorphism of the group H induces an automorphism\nof the Lie ring HL, and each element of H in HL has the same order under + as its\norder in the group H. Moreover, each subgroup of the group H is a Lie subring of\nHL.\nThe case of interest to us is when H is a subgroup of exponent p of a finite p-group\nG, say |H| = pn, and x \u2208 G has order p and normalizes H. Then conjugation by\nx induces an automorphism cx of order p of the additive group of HL, which is an\nelementary abelian group of rank n, and thus a vector space of dimension n over the\nprime field Fp. By considering the Jordan form of this automorphism, we get the\nrank of CH(x) as the number of Jordan blocks of cx, which is greater than or equal\nto n\/p.\n4 GEORGE GLAUBERMAN AND NADIA MAZZA\nThe following result is a consequence of P. Hall\u2019s Enumeration Principle (see [22,\nTheorem IV.4.19 (i)] or [12, Theorem 1.4]). Note that Lemma 2.3 generalizes to finite\nnilpotent groups, because they are the direct product of their Sylow p-subgroups.\nLemma 2.3. Let P be a finite p-group and Q a normal subgroup of order pn of P .\nFor each integer k with 0 \u2264 k < n, Q contains a subgroup Qk of order pk that is\nnormal in P .\nProof. We proceed by induction on k. If k = 0, the claim trivially holds. Assume\nk \u2265 1 and pick a subgroup Q1 \u2264 Q \u2229 Z(P ) with |Q1| = p. (Recall that any non-\ntrivial normal subgroup of P intersects Z(P ) non-trivially.) Then, Q1 \/ P . Set\npi : P \u2192 P\/Q1 for the natural projection map and write K = pi(K) for the image of\na subgroup K of P under pi. In P , we have by induction hypothesis that Q contains\na normal subgroup Qk of P of order p\nk\u22121. Therefore, Qk = pi\u22121(Qk) is a normal\nsubgroup of P contained in Q and |Qk| = pk. \u0003\nLemma 2.4. Suppose that E is a non-normal maximal elementary abelian subgroup\nof G of rank 2, and H is a subgroup of exponent p in G that is normalized by E.\nLet |H| = pn. Then:\n(a) for each positive integer k less than n, H contains a subgroup Hk of order\npk that is normalized by E;\n(b) n \u2264 p; and\n(c) if E is not contained in H, then the subgroup Hk in part (a) is unique, for\neach k.\nProof. Let E = \u3008z, x\u3009, with z \u2208 Z(G). Note that H is normal in HE.\nEach part of the lemma is vacuous or obvious if |H| \u2264 p or if H = E. So we\nassume that |H| \u2265 p2 and that H 6= E. Then CE(H) = \u3008z\u3009 and\n(A) CH(x) = CH(E) = H \u2229 E .\nPart (a) is Lemma 2.3 applied to P = HE and Q = H. Thus, for each 0 \u2264 k < n,\nthe group H contains a subgroup Hk of order p\nk that is normalized by E (see also\nrelated results in [17, Proposition 0.1]).\nFor part (b), assume that n \u2265 p+ 1. We aim for a contradiction. By (a), we may\nassume that n = p+ 1.\nSince H has exponent p, it is a regular p-group. Therefore, by a theorem of N.\nBlackburn ([15, Satz III.14.21]; [2, Theorem 9.5]), H is not a p-group of maximal\nclass.\nSuppose first that x \u2208 H. Since |H| > p2, we see that\n\u3008x\u3009 < CH(x) = CH(E) = H \u2229 E .\nHence\n|CH(x)| = |E| = p2 , and |H : CH(x)| = |H|\/p2 .\nBy Suzuki\u2019s Theorem mentioned in Section 1, H is a p-group of maximal class, a\ncontradiction. Thus, x lies outside H, and\n(B) |CH(x)| = |H \u2229 E| \u2264 p .\np-GROUPS WITH MAXIMAL ELEMENTARY ABELIAN SUBGROUPS OF RANK 2 5\nSince |H| = pp+1 and H does not have maximal class, H has class at most p\u2212 1.\nWe appeal to Remark 2.2. Explicitly, conjugation by x induces an automorphism\nof order p of the additive group of the Lie ring HL, which is an elementary abelian\ngroup of rank p+ 1, and thus a vector space of dimension p+ 1 over the prime field\nFp. By considering the Jordan form of this automorphism, we see that it has at\nleast two Jordan blocks. Therefore, |CH(x)| \u2265 p2. But |CH(x)| \u2264 p by (B), a\ncontradiction.\nFor part (c), we assume that E is not contained in H. By (A), we have |CH(x)| =\n|H\u2229E| \u2264 p . By part (b), |H| \u2264 pp. Hence, H has nilpotence class at most p\u22121. As\nin (b), we apply Lazard\u2019s theorem and consider the Jordan form of the automorphism\nof HL induced by conjugation by x. As |CH(x)| \u2264 p, this is a single Jordan block\nof degree n. Therefore, x preserves a unique k-dimensional subspace of HL over Fp,\nwhich proves (c). \u0003\nFrom these technicalities, we draw the following conclusion.\nProposition 2.5. Assume that p is odd and that G has rank greater than 2. If G\nhas some non-normal maximal elementary abelian subgroup of rank 2, then G has a\nunique normal elementary abelian subgroup of rank 2, which is hence a characteristic\nsubgroup of G.\nProof. Suppose that G contains a normal elementary abelian subgroup F of rank 2\nother than the chosen subgroup E0 which we introduced after Definition 2.1. Let\nH = E0F . Then F contains Z, and E0\/Z and F\/Z are contained in the center of\nG\/Z. Therefore, H has order p3 and nilpotence class at most 2, and possesses more\nthan one elementary abelian subgroup of order p2. A review of the groups of order\np3 for odd p (or an application of [11, Theorem 12.4.3], since H is a regular p-group)\nshows that H has exponent p.\nAs E\/Z is not normal in G\/Z and since H\/Z is central in G\/Z, we see that E is\nnot contained in H. By Lemma 2.4, E normalizes only one subgroup of order p2 in\nH. But E normalizes E0 and F , a contradiction. \u0003\nRemark 2.6. We refer the reader to [21, Corollary 2.3] for the case when G has\nonly normal elementary abelian subgroups of rank 2.\n3. Proof of the main result\nFor convenience, we appeal to some additional standard notation. For any finite\np-group G of nilpotence class c, we write\n1 = Z0(G) \u2264 Z1(G) \u2264 Z2(G) \u2264 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2264 Zc(G) = G ,\nwith Z1(G) = Z(G) , and Zi(G)\/Zi\u22121(G) = Z\n(\nG\/Zi\u22121(G)\n)\n, \u2200 1 \u2264 i \u2264 c ,\nfor the subgroups in the upper central series of G. Recall that the least positive\ninteger c with Zc(G) = G is the nilpotence class of G. For subgroups H,K of G, the\nsubgroup \u3008HK\u3009 of G is generated by the K-conjugates of H. In particular, \u3008HG\u3009 is\nthe normal closure of H in G. Also, \u2126d(H) is the subgroup \u3008x \u2208 H | xpd = 1\u3009 of G\ngenerated by the elements of order at most pd, for any integer d \u2265 1.\nThe following lemma is equivalent to [12, Theorem 2.49, (i)].\n6 GEORGE GLAUBERMAN AND NADIA MAZZA\nLemma 3.1. Suppose that N is a normal subgroup of G and k is an integer, k \u2265 0.\n(a) If N \u2229 Zk(G) = N \u2229 Zk+1(G), then N \u2264 Zk(G).\n(b) If |N | = pk, then N \u2264 Zk(G).\nProof. For part (a), let M = N \u2229 Zk(G) and G = G\/M , and let X = XM\/M for\nevery subgroup X of G. Then, N \/ G, and since M \u2264 Zk(G), the definition of the\nupper central series gives\nZ(G) \u2264 Zk+1(G)\/M and so N \u2229 Z(G) \u2264 (N \u2229 Zk+1(G))\/M = 1 .\nHence, N = 1.\nPart (b) follows from (a). Indeed, let N \/ G. Assume that N \u0002 Zk(G). Then\n1 = N \u2229 Z0(G) < N \u2229 Z1(G) < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < N \u2229 Zk+1(G) ,\nis a strictly increasing chain of subgroups of G. Thus, we must have |N | > pk. \u0003\nIn view of [10, Proposition 10.17] (or [17, Theorem]), if p = 3 and G has rank\nat least 4, then G has normal rank 4. Consequently, Theorem A holds for p = 3,\nas also observed in [21]. So, we may in addition suppose that p \u2265 5 from now on.\nThus, Theorem A follows from our next result.\nTheorem 3.2. Let p be a prime greater than 3, and assume that G has order pn.\nIf G has a non-normal maximal elementary abelian subgroup of rank 2, then G has\nrank at most p.\nProof. We assume that G has rank greater than p and work toward a contradiction.\nLet E be a non-normal maximal elementary abelian subgroup of rank 2 in G. By\nhypothesis, p \u2265 5 and G contains an elementary abelian subgroup A of rank p+ 1.\nBy [1, Theorem D], we may choose A to be normal in its normal closure, \u3008AG\u3009,\nin G. Let N = \u3008AG\u3009.\nSince A \/ N , Lemma 2.3 says that A contains a normal subgroup B of N having\norder pp\u22121.\nLet M = \u21261(Zp\u22121(N)). Then M \/ G and B \u2264 M by Lemma 3.1. Since Zp\u22121(N)\nhas class at most p\u22121, it is a regular p-group. Therefore, M has exponent p because\nit is a regular p-group generated by elements of order p. Since M \/ G, Lemma 2.4\nyields that |M | \u2264 pp. Hence, |M : B| \u2264 p.\nLet Y = \u21261(Z2(N)) and W = \u21261(Z(N)). Then\nW \u2264 Y \u2264M and W,Y \/ G .\nAssume first that Y \u2264 A. Then CG(Y )\/G and A \u2264 CG(Y ). Therefore, N = \u3008AG\u3009 \u2264\nCG(Y ), and Y \u2264 Z(N). More generally, observe similarly that any normal abelian\nsubgroup of G that is contained in any conjugate of A is necessarily contained in\nZ(N). Then\nA \u2229 Z2(N) = A \u2229 Y = A \u2229 Z(N) ,\nand A \u2264 Z(N), by Lemma 3.1. But then,\nA \u2264 \u21261(Zp\u22121(N)) = M and pp+1 = |A| \u2264 |M | \u2264 pp ,\na contradiction. Thus, Y is not contained in A. Therefore, B < BY \u2264M .\np-GROUPS WITH MAXIMAL ELEMENTARY ABELIAN SUBGROUPS OF RANK 2 7\nSince |M : B| \u2264 p, we have M = BY . Moreover, Y\/W \u2264 Z(N\/W ). Therefore,\nM\/W is centralized by AW\/W . As M \/ G, it follows that M\/W is centralized by\n\u3008AG\u3009W\/W , i.e., by N\/W . Therefore, M \u2264 Z2(N). But now,\nA \u2229 Z3(N) \u2264 A \u2229 Zp\u22121(N) = A \u2229M = A \u2229 Z2(N) .\nSo A \u2229 Z3(N) = A \u2229 Z2(N). By Lemma 3.1, A \u2264 Z2(N). Hence, A \u2264 M , and we\nobtain a contradiction as in the previous paragraph. \u0003\nNow we obtain our main result.\nTheorem A. Let p be an odd prime and let G be a finite p-group. If G has rank\nat least p+ 1, then G has no maximal elementary abelian subgroup of order p2.\nTheorem A contrasts sharply with the situation for p = 2.\nRemark 3.3. Suppose G is a 2-group possessing a maximal elementary abelian\nsubgroup of rank 2. By Lemma 2.4, G has no normal elementary abelian subgroup\nof rank 3. Therefore, by a theorem of Anne MacWilliams Patterson [20], every\nsubgroup of G is generated by 4 or fewer elements. Hence, G has rank at most 4.\nExamples in [10, p. 68] show that G may have rank 3. Here, we give an example\nof rank 4.\nLet F be the finite field of order 4. For each a, b, c in F, let M(a, b, c) be the 3\u00d7 3\nmatrix over F given by\nM(a, b, c) =\n\uf8eb\uf8ed1 a c0 1 b\n0 0 1\n\uf8f6\uf8f8\nLet U be the set of all matrices M(a, b, c). Then U is a group under multiplication\nand is a Sylow 2-subgroup of GL3(4).\nFor each a in F, let a\u00af = a2; thus, we obtain the unique non-trivial field automor-\nphism of F. Let t be the mapping on U given by\nM(a, b, c)t = M(b\u00af, a\u00af, a\u00afb\u00af+ c\u00af) .\nThen t is an automorphism of order two of U (and comes from a unitary automor-\nphism of order two of GL3(4)). Let G be the semi-direct product of U by \u3008t\u3009.\nNote that CU(t) is the group of all matrices of the form M(a, a\u00af, c) such that\nc + c\u00af = aa\u00af. This group is a quaternion group of order 8, and CG(t) = CU(t) \u00d7 \u3008t\u3009.\nThis shows that G possesses a maximal elementary abelian subgroup of rank 2,\nnamely, Z(CU(t))\u00d7 \u3008t\u3009. However, it is easy to see that U , and hence G, possess an\nelementary abelian subgroup of rank 4. Therefore, G has rank 4.\nWe end this section with a consequence of Theorem A concerning some important\nfinitely generated representations of an arbitrary finite group G\u2217 over a field k of\ncharacteristic p. (Hence, for the remainder of this section, we let G\u2217 denote an\narbitrary finite group.) The relationship between the group of endotrivial kG\u2217-\nmodules T (G\u2217) and the result stated in Theorem A is that the torsion-free rank of\nthe group T (G\u2217) equals the number of conjugacy classes of connected components\n8 GEORGE GLAUBERMAN AND NADIA MAZZA\nof the poset E(G\u2217) ([5, \u00a7 3]). By [4] and [21], this number is at most 5 if p = 2 and\nat most p+ 1 if p is odd. In the particular case that T (G\u2217) has torsion-free rank 1,\nthe description of T (G\u2217) is much easier, according to the results and notation of [5]\n(explained below). Indeed, in this case, any endotrivial kG\u2217-module is isomorphic\nto a direct summand of a module of the form\n\u2126n(k)\u2297M\nfor some integer n and some torsion endotrivial kG\u2217-module M . Hence, Theorem A\nprovides a criterion for this to happen which only depends on the p-rank of G\u2217.\nFor completeness, we explain the above concepts. We let k denote both a chosen\nfield of characteristic p and the 1-dimensional trivial kG\u2217-module. The modules\n\u2126n(k) are the syzygies of k. These are defined inductively as follows: Let P\u2217 \u0010 k\nbe a minimal projective resolution of k. Then, \u21260(k) = k and for n > 0,\n\u2126n(k) = ker\n(\nPn\u22121 \u0010 \u2126n\u22121(k)\n)\n.\nFor n < 0, we set \u2126n(k) = \u2126\u2212n(k)\u2217, the k-linear dual of \u2126\u2212n(k). Also, M is a torsion\nendotrivial module if there is a positive integer m and a projective kG\u2217-module F\nsuch that M\u2297m \u223c= k\u2295F . For additional background material on endotrivial modules,\nwe refer the reader to [6] and [5].\nNow, to obtain Corollary B, we also recall that for an arbitrary finite group G\u2217\nand prime number p, the p-rank of G\u2217 is the rank of a Sylow p-subgroup Sp of G\u2217.\nNote that the poset E(G\u2217) has at most as many conjugacy classes of components as\nthe poset E(Sp), and E(G\u2217) is non-empty whenever E(Sp) is non-empty. Therefore,\nif E(Sp) is connected, then the components of E(G\u2217) form a single conjugacy class.\nThis proves:\nCorollary B. Let p be an odd prime and G\u2217 a finite group having p-rank greater\nthan p. For any field k of characteristic p, the group T (G\u2217) of endotrivial kG\u2217-\nmodules has torsion-free rank one. More precisely, any endotrivial kG\u2217-module is\nisomorphic to a direct summand of a module of the form \u2126n(k)\u2297M , for some integer\nn and some torsion endotrivial module M .\n4. The class-breadth conjecture\nWe end this note with the class-breadth conjecture for the finite p-groups G whose\nposet E(G) has more than one component.\nLet G be a finite p-group. For x in G, the breadth b(x) of x is given by pb(x) =\n|G : CG(x)|. In particular, b(x) = 0 if and only if x lies in Z(G). The breadth b(G)\nof G is the maximum of b(x) as x ranges over G.\nLet c(G) denote the nilpotence class of G. The class-breadth conjecture (also\nknown as the Breadth Conjecture) states that the inequality\nc(G) \u2264 b(G) + 1\nalways holds. Although counterexamples have been found for p = 2, none is known\nfor p odd. For background and recent results about the class-breadth conjecture,\nwe refer the reader to [19] and [7]. In particular, several cases are known to be true,\np-GROUPS WITH MAXIMAL ELEMENTARY ABELIAN SUBGROUPS OF RANK 2 9\nand moreover, the bound is optimal, in the sense that there are groups for which the\nequality c(G) = b(G) + 1 holds. The finite abelian p-groups and those of maximal\nnilpotence class are such instances, and [19] presents further cases.\nProposition C. Let p be an odd prime and G a finite p-group. Assume that the\nposet E(G) has more than one component. Then the class-breadth conjecture holds\nfor G.\nProof. Write c = c(G) for the nilpotence class of G. Let E = \u3008x, z\u3009 be a maximal\nelementary abelian subgroup of G, with z \u2208 Z(G). By [3, Theorem], we obtain the\nequalities CG(E) = \u3008x\u3009 \u00d7 Z(NG(E)), with Z(NG(E)) cyclic, and\n|G : CG(E)| = |G : CG(x)| = pc\u22121.\nHence c = b(x) + 1. Since b(G) \u2265 b(x), the class-breadth conjecture c \u2264 b(G) + 1\nholds for G. \u0003\nRemark 4.1. Observe that a similar proof shows that the class-breadth conjecture\nholds for any finite p-group G having some soft subgroup A such that, for every\nproper subgroup H of G containing A, the nilpotence class of NG(H) is one more\nthan the nilpotence class of H.\nAcknowledgments.
