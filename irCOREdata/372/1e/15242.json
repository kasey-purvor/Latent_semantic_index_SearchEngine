INTRODUCTION \nThe terahertz region of the electromagnetic spectrum (300 GHz to 10 THz) has attracted considerable attention in recent \nliterature. However, when compared to the optical and microwave regions, it is still relatively unexplored. The so-called \n\u2018terahertz\u2019 gap has now been bridged through the development of efficient generation and detection systems [1]. \nApplications are rapidly emerging in the fields of imaging and spectroscopy for biomedical, security and manufacturing \ncontrol. However, the continued development of THz based systems is reliant upon the implementation of new \ntechniques to effectively guide, focus and filter the radiation. Artificial materials have engineered properties which may \nbe difficult to obtain or even unavailable in nature, such as negative refractive indices [2]. This paper reports on the \ndevelopment and testing of artificial material based filters. \nMicromachining is the fabrication of three dimensional surfaces and structures at scales from submicron to millimetre \nand is therefore well suited to the fabrication of terahertz artificial materials (where 1 THz = 300 \u00b5m). Both surface and \nbulk techniques are well established for the fabrication of three dimensional topologies at micron resolution. These \nprocesses are adapted from those used in the integrated circuit industry and therefore can be readily implemented in \nproduction environments. \nIn 2003, Wu et al [3] demonstrated a high pass pillar array filter using a direct write microstereolithography based \nfabrication process. Subsequently, Shew et al [4] have used x-ray exposure of SU8 and Torosyan et al [5] manually \npositioned wires into machined grooves to form the devices.  \nIn this paper we investigate the terahertz response of arrays of high aspect ratio gold coated SU8 polymer pillars \nfabricated with the readily available UV exposure technique. We have shown previously that single period square grid \nbased arrays exhibit a clear pass and stop bands in the THz region (fig. 1) [6]. Here we build upon this work by \ndemonstrating more complex arrays which can isolate and even sharpen specific pass bands. This provides a new type of \nfiltering technology in a region where traditional electrical techniques are difficult to implement.  \n \n*a.j.gallant@durham.ac.uk. phone +44 191 334 2525 fax +44 191 334 2407 \n \nTerahertz and Gigahertz Electronics and Photonics VI, edited by Kurt J.

PILLAR ARRAY FILTERS \nFig. 2 shows the principle of operation of the pillar array based filter. It is important to ensure that the incident beam is \npolarised such that the E field is parallel to the pillars and also well focused. All of the arrays presented in this paper are \nat least 20 pillars wide with a square based grid arrangement. \nThe pillar array acts as a diluted metal with an artificially lowered plasma frequency [7]. W have shown previously that, \nin the region of the artificial plasma frequency, clear pass and stop bands exist. In the pass bands a relative transmission \nof up to 97% has been achieved [6] which is sufficiently high to enable individual arrays to be combined. This introduces \nthe potential for a multiple filtering approach without significantly impairing the transmission.  \nBroadband\nTHz in\nMetal pillar\narray\nE\nFiltered\nTHz out\n \nFig. 2 The filter is placed in a focused THz beam with the E field orientated parallel to the direction of the pillars. \n \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 6472  647206-2\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 08 Mar 2011 to 129.234.252.65.

This has a usable \nbandwidth of approximately 3 THz. A Ti:sapphire laser produces a 600 mW pulse of 20 fs duration with a repetition rate \nof 76 MHz. This is separated into a THz generating and a gating beam with a 70:30 beam splitter. The generating beam \nis focused onto an LT-GaAs photoconductive strip-line emitter which is dc biased to 250V. Parabolic mirrors are used to \nfocus the THz signal onto the pillar array sample.  \nThe beam diameter is approximately 1 mm and is comparable to the height of the pillars. At lower frequencies (hundreds \nof GHz) the beam is more divergent and can therefore pass over the top of the pillars leading to some unfiltered leakage. \nOptical delay line\nChopper\nPhotoconductive\nTHz emitter\nDry N2 purge box\nZnTe EOS crystal\n\u03bb\/4 plate\nWollaston prism\nBalanced detection\nSample\nCoherent Mira Seed\n600mW, 76MHz, ~20fs\n \nFig. 3 A schematic of the broadband THz \u2013 Time Domain Spectroscopy system \n \nThe gating and the THz beam are focused onto a 1 mm thick ZnTe electrooptic crystal. This, in conjunction with a \nbalanced detector, is used to detect the transmitted THz. A delay line on the generation signal allows the electric field of \nthe THz pulse to be scanned in the time domain. A Fast Fourier Transform is then used to obtain a frequency spectrum. \nThis system provides a usable bandwidth of approximately 3 THz.  \nFor relative transmission measurements, the sample scan is divided by a free space scan in the frequency domain. This \neffectively deconvolves any reflected signals associated with the measurement setup.  \nThe pillar arrays have to be treated as another element in the THz time domain system and therefore, as with a more \nconventional part of an optical\/THz system, require careful optimisation in terms of position. This optimisation is easily \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 6472  647206-3\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 08 Mar 2011 to 129.234.252.65.

Fig. 4 shows the clear difference between a free space THz \ntime domain signal and one that has been filtered by the pillar array.

A measured time domain signal in free space (left) and after pillar array filtering (right) \n4. FABRICATION \nThe fabrication of high aspect ratio pillar arrays is achieved via an SU8 fabrication process. First, an optically opaque \nmetal such as gold is evaporated onto a glass wafer. This metal is then patterned with holes where the SU8 should remain \nto form the pillars. Then, a layer of SU8-50 is drop dispensed onto the glass wafer and confined by an o-ring during its \nsoft bake stage. This bake is performed for 5 hours at 120 \u00b0C.  \nAfter cooling, the wafer is flipped over and exposed with broadband UV in order to partially cross link the SU8. Full \ncross linking is achieved after a post exposure bake of 1 hour at 120 \u00b0C. The wafer is then developed in EC solvent and \nair dried to release the micropillar arrays. Using this technique pillars can readily be fabricated with diameters as small as \n40 \u00b5m and heights in excess of 1 mm. SU8 layers of several mm can be effectively cured using this technique. However, \nsmaller pillar diameters (i.e. smaller apertures in the gold layer) restrict the incident UV and act to limit the final pillar \nheight. \nThe SU8 is fairly transparent to the incident THz radiation, and therefore it is necessary to sputter coat the pillars with \ngold (approximately 0.3 \u00b5m). The pillars can, since this is thicker than the skin depth, be treated as metal rods [4]. This \nfabrication technique is very adaptable since complex pillar arrays can be created by simply changing the \nphotolithographic mask which defines the metal pattern on the glass substrate. \n \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 6472  647206-4\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 08 Mar 2011 to 129.234.252.65. Terms of Use:  http:\/\/spiedl.org\/terms\n  \n5 TESTING \n5.1 Varying the periodicity \nThe pillar height is fixed by the fabrication process and primarily acts to effectively confine the beam. Therefore the \npillar periodicity and diameter represent the two main variable parameters available for the filter design. We have \nreported previously the response of individual grid based pillar arrays with various pillar diameters but at a constant \nperiod of 200 \u00b5m.  \nFig. 5 shows the measured relative transmission for pillar arrays with a range of periods. A clear band structure is evident \nin the results. The effect of decreasing the period is to increase the fill factor of the structures. Hence the gold becomes \nless diluted and therefore the band features shift to higher frequencies, closer to the plasma frequency of bulk gold. \nHowever, the presence of these multiple bands is undesirable if, for example, it is necessary to excite a sample at a \nspecific single frequency from a broadband source. This is unachievable through the single period or diameter type \narrays. \n0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 2.2 2.4 2.6\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6R\nel\na\ntiv\ne\n \nT\nra\nn\nsm\nis\nsi\no\nn\nf, THz\nPeriod 200\u00b5m\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n \nPeriod 210\u00b5m\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6 Period 220\u00b5m\n \nFig. 5 Relative transmission for pillar arrays with pillar diameter of 50 \u00b5m, 4 layers deep and various periods as indicated \n \n5. 2 Compound filters: periodicity \nAs discussed in section 2 it is possible to use the existing fabrication process to produce a compound filter which \ncombines two pillar arrays with, for example, different periodicities. However, as more layers are added it becomes more \ndifficult to fully confine the beam in all of the layers. Fig.  6 shows the relative transmission for three different \ncompound filters. In the 200 \u00b5m \/210 \u00b5m and 200 \u00b5m \/220 \u00b5m period filters only one pass clear pass band is evident. \nThis can be sharpened by increasing the difference between the periods. However, if the period difference between the \ntwo filters is increased too much then the main pass band can be fully extinguished as demonstrated for the 200 \u00b5m \n\/250 \u00b5m period filter shown in fig 6. \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 6472  647206-5\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 08 Mar 2011 to 129.234.252.65.

Fig. 8 \nshows the effect of varying the gap between the 60 \u00b5m\/70 \u00b5m pillar arrays.

In this situation, if low frequency \nleakage is to be avoided, then the beam has to be confined by focusing it closer to the substrate.

CONCLUSIONS \nThe use of micromachining for the fabrication of high aspect ratio pillar array based filters enables a wide variety of \nfilter characteristics to be demonstrated. By combining individual arrays with different periodicities or pillar diameters \nthen single narrow pass bands can be isolated and sharpened. Furthermore, the time domain signal has been shown to be \nan effective method of optimising the filter elements in the time domain spectrometry system. \nThe ability to create specific filter characteristics and, in particular, to isolate particular pass bands through the \ntechniques presented in this paper open up a wide variety of filtering possibilities for the THz region. Furthermore, since \nall of the filters presented in this paper can be fabricated on a single substrate, using a single mask, then tuning can be \nachieved by simply moving the filter in the THz beam onto another filter type. \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThis project has been funded by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC).
