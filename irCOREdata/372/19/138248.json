Market pressures combined with this\nmean that a new or modified coating needs to be tested and proven as rapidly as possible\nbefore it can be marketed with the guarantees expected of today\u2019s high performance\nproducts. Traditionally accelerated cabinet tests have been used such as ISO 11997\n(cyclic \u2013 prohesion) which determines resistance to cyclic wet \/ dry \/ humidity and ultra-\nviolet light conditions. Other cabinet tests use only salt spray or alternate wet dry cycles\n[1,2], but the aim of the tests is essentially the same in that they attempt to accelerate the\nageing mechanism of the coating under test. The assessment of coated panels from these\ntests is usually by eye, assessed against a standard or measured in the case of coating\nunder-cut at a scribe and it is here that electrochemical techniques can be of great\nassistance. Not only is a numerical value obtained which can be directly related to\nexpected corrosion protection, but also by monitoring the performance of the coating\nwith time, different coatings \/ formulations can be compared. Some workers claim to be\nable to predict life times by extrapolation of electrochemical data [3], and good\ncorrelation has been seen between immersion testing (using ENM to monitor) and Cyclic\nProhesion testing with the less aggressive Harrison\u2019s Solution [4].\nThere are numerous electrochemical techniques in use for measurement of corrosion\nactivity and some of these have been adapted to coatings applications with great success.\nEach has its advantages and disadvantages and as such in isolation one method can be\nviewed as part of a toolbox of available techniques. The choice of which \u201ctool\u201d depends\nmuch on the particular requirements at the time. Some common electrochemical\ntechniques used for coating assessment are D.C resistance, impedance measurement,\nimpedance spectroscopy (EIS), electrochemical noise monitoring (ENM) [5,6,7] and the\nDC transient (current interruptor) method [8]. This paper concentrates on electrochemical\nnoise monitoring (ENM), which at one level can be used as a fast indicator of coating\ncondition and used by a low skilled operator, but by contrast has many complex\nmathematical treatments available that can satisfy the most ardent theoretical\nelectrochemist [9].\nIn particular this work concentrates on how the ENM technique has been adapted to\nenable a more practical application both as an assessment \/ screening tool in the\nlaboratory. In this it builds on previous work conducted by two of the authors [10,11] and\nultimately as a technique than can be applied in the field for condition monitoring. Some\nprevious attempts have been made using ENM or EIS looking at coatings on ships [12],\non bridges [13], and on transmission leg towers [14], Electrochemical Noise has also\nbeen applied to monitoring uncoated Chemical plant [15] and the adaptions described in\nthis paper could have application to that type of situation as well.\nELECTROCHEMICAL NOISE MONITORING BACKGROUND\nENM requires three electrodes to establish a parameter known as the noise resistance\n(Rn). Two of these are working electrodes and current is measured between them at\nregular intervals. Fluctuations in the current (typically in the \uf06dA or nA range) are called\ncurrent noise and this is calculated as the standard deviation of the data set.\nSimultaneously, as the current data is obtained, the potential difference is measured\nbetween the working electrode couple and a third electrode (the reference). The\nfluctuations in potential are also calculated as the standard deviation and by using the two\nstandard deviation values in an Ohm\u2019s law relationship (Equation 1.) the parameter Rn is\nobtained:\nRn = \uf073v\uf020\uf02f\uf020\uf073i Equation 1.\nRn is a useful parameter which has been shown to be proportional to polarisation\nresistance in certain circumstances where corrosion rate is relatively slow [16]. More\nuseful with regards to coated substrates is that a good correlation has been shown\nbetween Rn and D.C. resistance when measured through the coating. Bacon, Smith and\nRugg [17], did extensive D.C. measurements with organic coatings on steel in simulated\nsea water and found a relationship between the resistance value and the corrosion\nprotection afforded to the substrate. Less than 1 Mohm-cm2 indicated poor corrosion\nprotection, higher than 100 Mohm-cm2 indicated good corrosion protection, and a value\nin between these two limits demonstrated an intermediate level of corrosion protection.\nThe advantage of Rn over D.C. resistance measurement methods is that ENM only uses\nthe small naturally occurring fluctuations in potential (and hence current) between the\nelectrodes whereas D.C. and other electrochemical techniques impose sometimes quite\nhigh voltages across the coating to obtain a reading. This is potentially damaging to the\ncoating physically and can disrupt the dynamics of a delicate corrosion cell. However,\ndespite this considerable advantage, ENM has suffered from one considerable\ndisadvantage in that the technique in its traditional form requires three electrically\nisolated electrodes to perform the measurement. These three electrodes consist of two\nnominally identical substrate elements which act as working electrodes and a standard\nlaboratory electrode, such as saturated calomel or silver \/ silver chloride, as a reference\nelectrode. It can be appreciated that to carry out this technique in the field it is very\ndifficult to obtain two electrically isolated substrate elements in a structure and even then\nto make hard-wire connections to them.\nThe traditional method of obtaining electrochemical noise data is shown in Figure 1. In\naddition to the three electrodes a salt bridge is required as a path of ionic conduction\nbetween the electrolyte cells. The data logger and zero resistance ammeter (ZRA) are\ncontrolled by a standard personal computer. The ZRA is a specialist instrument which\nallows very small current measurements to be obtained without disturbing the corrosion\ncell circuit.\nADVANCES IN THE ENM TECHNIQUE\nIn an attempt to make ENM more applicable to field applications and for faster laboratory\nuse a development of the technique by one of the authors was devised as part of his PhD\nresearch. The new set-up was called the Single Substrate (SS) technique and involved a\nre-configuration of the electrical connections and use of different electrodes. As shown in\nFigure 2, the substrate is one complete unit carrying the two electrolyte cells attached to\nthe coating. The reference electrode lead from the ZRA is attached to the substrate, and\nas such even in a field application an electrical connection would be required. The\nsubstrate in this configuration acts as a reference and replaces the salt bridge. In the two\nseparate cells of electrolyte, standard laboratory electrodes act as working electrode 1 and\nworking electrode 2 and as such are connected to the ZRA. Much work has been done\nusing this technique on a range of coating resistances and even bare metal [18] and good\nagreement has been seen with both the standard (bridge method) of obtaining noise data\nand the D.C. resistance method.\nThe work presented here demonstrates a further development of the experimental set-up\nwhich has been called the No Connection to the Substrate (NOCS) technique. As the\nname implies this set-up does not require any electrical connection to the substrate and\nhence the advantage to field application becomes immediately obvious.\nEXPERIMENTAL\nSpecimen Preparation\nCoatings were applied to standard low carbon steel Q panels. Sets of samples were\nprepared, one for ENM to rank the coatings and other sets for cyclic cabinet test and\nexternal exposure. The Q panels were degreased in solvent and the coatings were then\napplied using a 150\u00b5m K-bar. This produced a dry film thickness (DFT) of 75\u00b5m which\nwas attained for each system. The samples were then air dried for 7 days before exposure.\nCoatings and Electrolyte\nThe coatings used in this work were waterborne and solvent based, comprising of:\n\uf077 Acrylic\n\uf077 Modified water thinneable alkyd\n\uf077 Modified short oil alkyd\n\uf077 vinyl-chloride acetate co-polymer\nThese were the same group of coatings which had been investigated earlier \u2013 other results\ncan be found [10,11].\nImmersion experiments were used for monitoring using ENM with samples exposed to\n0.5% Ammonium sulphate solution. The test area was 11cm2 with the samples exposed\nfor various time periods. Measurements were made in triplicate using three cells on each\npanel.\nExperimental set-up \u2013 ENM\nResults in this work were obtained using all three ENM techniques. The standard or\nBridge Method illustrated in Figure 1, the Single Substrate method Figure 2 and the most\nrecent development; the NOCS technique illustrated in Figure 3.\nThe NOCS technique is an extension of the Single Substrate in that it uses standard\nlaboratory electrodes in isolated cells as the working electrodes. However, in the NOCS\ntechnique the reference connection from the ZRA is also made to a laboratory electrode\nwhich is contained in a 3rd isolated cell of electrolyte attached to the coating. Hence, no\nelectrical connection is required to the substrate material. Apart from the experimental\nconfiguration, all other parameters and hardware remained constant throughout the work.\nDifferent electrode types were tried with the new configurations to address questions over\nthe influence of electrode type on the noise data. The data was gathered typically at 2 Hz\nfor 300 seconds. The dedicated software calculated the noise values automatically.\nFurther analysis of the data was done in Excel.\nData analysis\nTo address the question about the nature of the noise due to using different electrodes two\napproaches were adopted. First the absolute Rn values for each of the different\nconfigurations (Bridge, SS and NOCS) were compared and second the nature of the noise\ndistributions and also the relative contributions of the potential noise and current noise\nvalues to the Rn value were checked. Note that as statistical analysis is used to calculate\nthe Rn value, it is important that the noise data approximates a normal (Gaussian)\ndistribution to be a valid measurement.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nResults from previous work\nThe data in figures 4 and 5, show an overview of results from previous work [10, 11]\nobtained using the standard (fig 1) configuration. Figure 4, shows the Rn values of a range\nof compliant short oil alkyd paints versus time. This figure demonstrates how Rn can be\nused to rank a series of coatings performance in a relatively short time and it can be seen\nclearly that paints H and J which were low solvent developments out perform the other\nthree from early on in the test These tests were done in immersion, using 0.5%\nammonium sulphate solution. Figure 5, is a good comparison of the single substrate\ntechnique and traditional bridge method for an acrylic paint. In addition the D.C.\nresistance values are included of the two separate cells which made up the\nelectrochemical noise cell of two working electrodes and reference. If the D.C resistance\nvalues are taken to indicate that the coating is of a reasonable anti-corrosion performance,\nthe Rn values from both the bridge and the single substrate method correlate nicely.\nResults from the NOCS technique\nSamples from the paints used in previous work [10] were separated at the end of the main\ntests into groups which had high (>5.107 \uf057m.cm\u00b2), medium (106 \u2013 5.107 \uf057m.cm\u00b2) and\nlow (<106 \uf057m.cm\u00b2) resistances i.e. they would be expected to give high, medium and low\nlevel anti-corrosion performance. These groups were then used to investigate the NOCS\nmethod and particularly to see whether it worked over the full range of resistance.\nThe histogram in Figure 6, contains information from the three coating groups. Also\nincluded are readings from un-coated electrodes to demonstrate very low resistances\nwhich could be seen in the case of delaminated coating or studies of inhibitor\nperformance on bare metal. For each of the systems all three ENM configurations\n(Bridge, SS and NOCS) have been used to obtain an Rn value and for comparison the\nD.C. resistance value is included. D.C. measurements were done after ENM\nmeasurements were made so as not to disrupt the system. Although there is scatter on\nsome of the results, the trend in the values for each measurement method is generally\nvery good. Within each resistance range there is general grouping of the values which\nimprove towards the lower resistance end of the scale. Variations in value at the high end\nof the scale can probably be attributed to instrument limitations.\nThere are obviously more sources of noise with three laboratory electrodes and although\nthis was considered when the single substrate technique was first used it was never\ninvestigated fully. To investigate the question of electrode noise on the overall noise of\nthe system, the NOCS technique was employed using different types of electrode. The\nsets of electrodes chosen for this investigation were saturated calomel (SCE) , silver \/\nsilver chloride (Ag\/AgCl) and three pieces of platinum foil (Pt). This work was done\nagain using samples from coating systems which gave results within the Bacon, Smith\nand Rugg ranges. The data in Figure 7 shows the results of this investigation. There was\nno visible ranking between electrode type, and again although there is the usual scatter\nwithin the data, the trend through the coating resistance ranges is clear.\nResults from data analysis\nAs stated previously, for the Rn values and statistical operations to be valid, the data sets\nmust approximate a normal or Gaussian distribution. In previous work, analysis of both\nthe potential and current data, from the bridge method and single substrate method have\nshown this to hold good with intact coatings. Hence data distribution type was checked\nfor sets of data from the NOCS method. This showed Gaussian distribution for both\ncurrent and potential plots and a typical example is given in Figure 8.\nAdditional analysis of the data from the NOCS system involved examining the relative\ncontribution of the potential noise and the current noise to the final Rn value. Figures 9\nand 10 show the contributions using the three different electrodes on a high resistance\ncoating. This was repeated on medium and low resistance coating systems with the same\nresult (not presented here). It can be seen that the relative contributions of the potential\nnoise, Figure 9, and the current noise shown in Figure 10, are very similar despite the\ndifferent electrode types used.\nThe final analysis of the data involved comparing the relative contributions of current and\npotential noise to Rn, with the same coating system, but this time using all three\nexperimental three set-ups. Figures 11 and 12 show potential contribution and current\ncontribution respectively, for the NOCS technique, the bridge method and the single\nsubstrate method. Again there is good correlation between the Rn values obtained and\nmore importantly the relative contributions are very close regardless of the experimental\nconfiguration. This analysis was also carried out on medium and low resistance coating\ndata. These also gave consistent results although they are not presented here.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis work has shown that the Rn value obtained is independent of the experimental\nconfiguration, e.g. Single Substrate, NOCS, or traditional Bridge method.\nFurther, when NOCS is being used the distribution and contribution of the noise data is\nindependent of the type of electrode.\nAs such, it would appear that ENM might compete with AC Impedance as an effective\nmonitoring method in the field?\nThis work has helped buttress the technique and has greatly increased confidence in the\nRn value obtained by the less conventional experimental configurations. However, there\nis a need to look at other practical considerations of making the ENM measurements.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nPronto Industrial Paints Ltd.\nUniversity of Northampton (Dean of Applied Sciences :Dr Nick Boutle)\nMembers of staff at both UCN and Pronto: particularly Susan Maloney\nProfessor Bierwagen for support of work at NDSU on Naval coatings\nREFERENCES\n1.
