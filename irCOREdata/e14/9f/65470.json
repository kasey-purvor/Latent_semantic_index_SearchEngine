Madelaine and Iain A. Stewart\nDepartment of Computer Science, Durham University,\nScience Labs, South Road, Durham DH1 3LE, U.K.\nAbstract\nWe improve upon the best known upper and lower bounds on the sizes of minimal feedback\nvertex sets in butterflies. Also, we construct new feedback vertex sets in grids so that for a\nlarge number of pairs (n, m), the size of our feedback vertex set in the grid Mn,m matches\nthe best known lower bound, and for all other pairs it differs from this lower bound by at\nmost 2.\nKeywords: feedback vertex sets; grids; butterflies.\n1 Introduction\nA feedback vertex set in an undirected graph is a subset of vertices the removal of\nwhich (along with their incident edges) results in an acyclic graph. The feedback\nvertex set problem is to find a feedback vertex set of minimum cardinality in a graph\nG, with the size of such a set known as the feedback vertex number \u03c4(G). Whilst the\nfeedback vertex set problem is NP-hard in general, it has been extensively studied in a\nwide variety of restricted classes of graphs and shown to be polynomial-time solvable\nin many of these classes. Furthermore, a number of lower and upper bounds on\nthe feedback vertex number of graphs from these classes have been established. The\nreader is referred to [4] for an extensive survey of feedback vertex set problems which\nranges over polynomially solvable cases, approximation algorithms, exact algorithms,\npractical heuristics and applications.\nIn this paper, we are concerned with the classes of graphs known as grids and\nbutterflies. Such graphs are common in the study of interconnection networks for\nparallel processing as they have particularly attractive properties in this regard (see,\nfor example, [3]). The study of feedback vertex sets in grids and butterflies has\ntraditionally gone hand-in-hand. In [5], Luccio proved upper and lower bounds on\nthe sizes of minimal feedback vertex sets in both grids and butterflies. It was shown\nin [5] that the feedback vertex number of the grid Mn,m is at most\u230a\nmn\n3\n+\nm+ n\n6\n+ o(m,n)\n\u230b\n1\nand at least \u2308\n(m\u2212 1)(n\u2212 1) + 1\n3\n\u2309\n,\nand that the feedback vertex number of the butterfly Bd is at most\u230a\n(d+ 13 )2\nd + 13\n3\n\u230b\n(see the analysis in [2]) and at least\n2d\u22121\n\u230a\nd+ 1\n2\n\u230b\n(definitions of Mn,m and Bd follow). Subsequently, in [1], Caragiannis, Kaklamanis\nand Kanellopoulos improved the state of affairs by establishing a general lower bound\ntechnique by which they showed that the feedback vertex number of the butterfly Bd\nis at least \u2308\n(d\u2212 1)2d + 1\n3\n\u2309\n.\nThey also showed that the feedback vertex number of the grid Mn,m is at most\u230a\nmn\n3\n\u2212\nm+ n\u2212 5\n6\n\u230b\nand that the feedback vertex number of the butterfly Bd is at most\u230a\n(d+ 12 )2\nd\n3\n\u230b\n.\nFinally, more recently, Chang, Lin and Lee [2] both improved Luccio\u2019s analysis of\nthe sizes of feedback vertex sets in butterflies and exhibited an algorithm which con-\nstructed a feedback vertex set in Bd of size\u230a\n(d\u2212 23 )2\nd + 23\n3\n\u230b\n, if d is even,\nand of size \u230a\n(d\u2212 23 )2\nd\n3\n\u230b\n+\n2\u2308\nd\n2 \u2309 + 2\u230a\nd\n2 \u230b\n3\n, if d is odd.\nIn this paper, we improve upon Chang, Lin and Lee\u2019s algorithm and obtain a\nsmaller upper bound on the feedback vertex number of a butterfly Bd, when d \u2265 5.\nOur algorithm is very similar to that of Chang, Lin and Lee except that our \u2018starting\npoint\u2019 in the recursive algorithm is improved feedback vertex sets for B5 and B6. We\nfind that we can use Chang, Lin and Lee\u2019s analysis to prove our algorithm correct and\nalso to establish our improved bounds. We also improve upon Luccio\u2019s lower bound\non the feedback vertex numbers of butterflies. As regards grids, we make dramatic\nprogress. We construct new feedback vertex sets in grids so that for a large number\n2\nof pairs (n,m), the size of our feedback vertex set in the grid Mn,m matches the best\nknown lower bound (from [5]), and for all other pairs the size of our feedback vertex\nset is at most this lower bound plus 2.\nThis paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we provide the basic definitions,\nbefore dealing with feedback vertex sets in grids in Section 3 and in butterflies in\nSection 4. Our conclusions are given in Section 5.\n2 Basic definitions\nLet n,m \u2265 2. The rectangular grid with n rows and m columns (or n \u00d7 m mesh),\ndenoted by Mn,m, is the graph with vertex set V (Mn,m) defined as {vi,j : 0 \u2264 i <\nn, 0 \u2264 j < m} and edge set E(Mn,m) defined as\n{(vi,j , vi+1,j) : 0 \u2264 i < n\u2212 1, 0 \u2264 j < m}\n\u222a{(vi,j , vi,j+1) : 0 \u2264 i < n, 0 \u2264 j < m\u2212 1}.\nLet d \u2265 1. The d-dimensional butterfly Bd has vertex set V (Bd) partitioned into\n(d + 1) rows, whereupon each row contains 2d vertices. Every vertex of V (Bd) is\nindexed by the pair (i, j) where i indicates its row and j its column in that row: as\nsuch, we refer to the vertices of V (Bd) as {vi,j : 0 \u2264 i \u2264 d, 0 \u2264 j \u2264 2\nd \u2212 1}. The edge\nset E(Bd) of Bd consists of the following edges.\n\u2022 For every pair of adjacent rows, there is an edge joining corresponding vertices,\nvi,j and vi+1,j , on these two rows; that is, there are edges\n{(vi,j , vi+1,j) : 0 \u2264 i < d, 0 \u2264 j \u2264 2\nd \u2212 1}.\n\u2022 For every pair of adjacent rows, there is an edge joining a vertex vi,j on the\nlower-indexed row to the vertex vi+1,ji on the higher-indexed row so that the\nbinary representation of the integer ji differs from that of the integer j only in\nthe ith position (where the right-most bit is bit 0); that is, there are edges\n{(vi,j , vi+1,ji) : 0 \u2264 i < d, 0 \u2264 j \u2264 2\nd \u2212 1}.\nGrids and butterflies can be visualized as in Figs. 1 and 13, respectively.\nWe adopt the following notation (in line with that of Chang, Lin and Lee in [2]).\nIf G is a graph with vertex set V (G) and V \u2032 is a subset of vertices of V (G) then the\nsubgraph of G induced by the vertices of V \u2032 is denoted G[V \u2032] and the subgraph of G\ninduced by the vertices of V (G) \\ V \u2032 is denoted G \\ V \u2032.\n3 New upper bounds for grids\nIn this section, we derive new upper bounds on the sizes of minimal feedback vertex\nsets in two-dimensional grids. For a large number of pairs (n,m), our upper bound on\nthe size of a minimal feedback vertex set of Mn,m matches the lower bound from [5],\nand on the other pairs it differs from this lower bound by at most 2.\n3\n3.1 The bulk of the cases\nCase (i) Let n \u2265 4 be such that n \u2261 1 (mod 3), and let m \u2265 4 be even.\nDefine the set of vertices Xn,m of V (Mn,m) as An,m\u222aBn,m\u222aCn,m\u222aDn,m\u222aEn,m\u222aFn,m\nwhere:\nAn,m = {vi,j : 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n\u2212 1, i \u2261 1 (mod 6), 2 \u2264 j \u2264 m\u2212 2, j even};\nBn,m = {vi,j : 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n\u2212 1, i \u2261 2 (mod 6), 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m\u2212 3, j odd};\nCn,m = {vi,j : 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n\u2212 1, i \u2261 4 (mod 6), 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m\u2212 3, j odd};\nDn,m = {vi,j : 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n\u2212 1, i \u2261 5 (mod 6), 2 \u2264 j \u2264 m\u2212 2, j even};\nEn,m = {vi,1 : 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n\u2212 1, i \u2261 0 (mod 6)};\nFn,m = {vi,m\u22122 : 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n\u2212 1, i \u2261 3 (mod 6)}.\nThe set X10,8 is shown in Fig. 1, where the vertices of X10,8 have been annotated\naccording to their subsets in the above definition.\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n2 30 1 6 74 5\nrow\ncolumn\nA\nAAA\nAA\nB\nBBB\nBB\nCCC\nDDD\nE\nE\nF\nF\nFigure 1. The set of vertices X10,8.\nWe claim that Xn,m is a feedback vertex set. Observe that if there is a cycle in\nMn,m \\Xn,m then the inclusion of the vertices of An,m\u222aBn,m\u222aCn,m\u222aDn,m in Xn,m\nmeans that the cycle must use only the perimeter vertices of Mn,m or the vertices on\nrow i, for each i \u2261 0 (mod 3). However, the vertices of En,m and Fn,m preclude any\nsuch cycle, and so Xn,m is a feedback vertex set of Mn,m. The size of Xn,m is\n(n\u2212 1)\n3\n(m\u2212 2) +\n(n\u2212 1)\n3\n+ 1 =\n(n\u2212 1)(m\u2212 1)\n3\n+ 1,\nwhile Luccio\u2019s lower bound, which we denote lbn,m, is\nlbn,m =\n\u2308\n(m\u2212 1)(n\u2212 1) + 1\n3\n\u2309\n,\nwhich, for n \u2261 1 (mod 3) and m even, is identical to the size of Xn,m. Hence, Xn,m\nis a feedback vertex set of minimal size.\n4\nBefore continuing, let us look at the feedback vertex set Xn,m and why it is of\nminimal size from a different perspective (this perspective underpins Luccio\u2019s lower\nbound construction in [5] but will be of use to us later in alternative contexts). Con-\nsider the perimeter-cycle of Mn,m; this cycle must contain at least one vertex from\nany feedback vertex set, so choose such a vertex to be v0,1. After removing v0,1 and\nany incident edges from Mn,m, to get M\n1\nn,m, there is a natural perimeter-cycle which\nis as before except that the sub-path navigating around v0,1 is\n. . . , v2,0, v1,0, v1,1, v1,2, v0,2, v0,3, . . .\nAlso note that the sub-graph of the original Mn,m induced by the vertices strictly\noutside the perimeter-cycle but not vertices of our partial feedback vertex set (at\npresent, just the vertex v0,0) is acyclic.\nSimilarly, the perimeter-cycle ofM1n,m contains at least one vertex of any resulting\nfeedback vertex set; so choose the vertex v1,2 to be such a vertex. In M\n2\nn,m, obtained\nfromM1n,m by removing v1,2 and any incident edges, there is a natural perimeter cycle\nand the sub-graph of the original Mn,m induced by the vertices strictly outside the\nperimeter-cycle but not vertices of our partial feedback vertex set (at present, just\nthe vertices v0,0 and v0,2) is acyclic.\nSimilarly, the perimeter-cycle ofM2n,m contains at least one vertex of any resulting\nfeedback vertex set; so choose the vertex v2,3 to be such a vertex. In M\n3\nn,m, obtained\nfromM2n,m by removing v2,3 and any incident edges, there is a natural perimeter cycle\nand the sub-graph of the original Mn,m induced by the vertices strictly outside the\nperimeter-cycle but not vertices of our partial feedback vertex set (at present, just\nthe vertices v0,0 and v0,2) is acyclic.\nContinuing in this fashion ultimately results in a perimeter-cycle the \u2018breaking\u2019\nof which results in an empty perimeter-cycle, so that the sub-graph of Mn,m induced\nby those vertices not in the resulting feedback vertex set is indeed acyclic. This\nconstructive approach to the formation of Xn,m can be visualized as in Fig. 2, where\nthe order in which perimeter-cycle vertices are chosen is given and where at each stage,\nthe edges incident with the chosen vertex and outside the resulting perimeter-cycle\nare omitted. Yet another alternative way of viewing the construction of Xn,m is via\na tessellation of the grid, in a natural way. Note that given any feedback vertex set\nX, a feedback vertex set Y \u2286 X can be constructed by adopting the above procedure\nand making appropriate choices.\nApart from the first and last choices of the vertices ofXn,m in the above procedure,\nthe choices are optimal in the sense that at any stage, no other choice could decrease\nthe number of cells inside the perimeter-cycle more than the number resulting from\nthe vertex chosen (the most the number of cells can decrease by is 3, as is the case\nwith our choices). Indeed, the first choice of vertex is optimal in this sense too (with\na decrease of 2 cells). Initially, there are (n \u2212 1)(m \u2212 1) cells, and any first choice\ndecreases this number to at least (n\u22121)(m\u22121)\u22122. Subsequent choices decrease this\nnumber by at most 3 cells per choice, and so as n \u2261 1 (mod 3), after\n(n\u2212 1)(m\u2212 1)\n3\nchoices, there is at least 1 cell inside the perimeter-cycle. Thus, the size of any\n5\nfeedback vertex set is at least\n(n\u2212 1)(m\u2212 1)\n3\n+ 1.\n1011\n12\n13\n14\n16\n1817\n8\n9\n2\n3\n15\n1\n6\n7\n4\n5\n19\n22\n21\n20\nFigure 2. The set of vertices X10,8 formed by perimeter-breaking.\nCase (ii) Let n \u2265 4 be such that n \u2261 1 (mod 3), and let m \u2265 7 be odd.\nPartition Mn,m into two sub-grids, one, call it M\n\u2032\nn,m, induced by the vertices in\ncolumns 0, 1 and 2, and one, call it M \u2032\u2032n,m, induced by the vertices in the remaining\ncolumns. Note that M \u2032\u2032n,m is such that it has an even number of columns. There are\ntwo cases, depending upon whether n \u2261 1 (mod 6) or not.\nSub-case (ii.a) n \u2261 4 (mod 6).\nWe can build a set of vertices X \u2032\u2032n,m in M\n\u2032\u2032\nn,m, as above, except starting from the\nright-hand side as opposed to the left.

However, we have another construction which enables us to construct a minimal\nfeedback vertex set in some of these cases. Moreover, our construction also allows\nus to use feedback vertex sets in smaller grids to build feedback vertex sets in larger\ngrids where the size of the constructed feedback vertex set is \u2018controlled\u2019 in terms of\nthe size of the original feedback vertex set.\nWe can expand the grid Mn,m by: \u2018placing\u2019 a new edge-vertex in the \u2018middle\u2019 of\neach edge of Mn,m; \u2018placing\u2019 a new cell-vertex in the \u2018middle\u2019 of each cell of Mn,m;\nand joining each new cell-vertex to the new edge-vertices on the \u2018perimeter\u2019 of its\ncell. Note that the expanded grid, which we denote E(Mn,m), is actually a copy of\nM2n\u22121,2m\u22121.\nLetX be a feedback vertex set ofMn,m. We expandMn,m into E(Mn,m) and define\nthe set of vertices E(X) to consist of the vertices corresponding to the vertices of X\nin union with the set of cell-vertices of E(Mn,m). It is immediate that the set E(X)\nis a feedback vertex set of E(Mn,m) (essentially, if we remove the cell-vertices from\nE(Mn,m) then cycles correspond to cycles inMn,m, and vice versa). The construction\ncan be visualized as in Fig. 7, where the white vertices in M9,9, on the right, are\nvertices of its feedback vertex set corresponding to the vertices of the feedback vertex\nset inM5,5, on the left, and the grey, square vertices inM9,9 are the added cell-vertices.\nThe size of the feedback vertex set E(X) of E(Mn,m) is equal to the size of the\nfeedback vertex set X of Mn,m plus (n\u2212 1)(m\u2212 1). That is,\n|E(X)| = |X|+ (n\u2212 1)(m\u2212 1).\nLuccio\u2019s lower bounds lbn,m and lb2n\u22121,2m\u22121 on the sizes of minimal feedback vertex\nsets of Mn,m and M2n\u22121,2m\u22121 are\u2308\nnm\u2212 n\u2212m+ 2\n3\n\u2309\nand\n\u2308\n4nm\u2212 4n\u2212 4m+ 5\n3\n\u2309\n,\n12\nrespectively. Hence,\n|E(X)| \u2212 lb2n\u22121,2m\u22121 = |X| \u2212 lbn,m.\nThus, the \u2018distance\u2019 a feedback vertex set is away from the lower bound lbn,m inMn,m\nis preserved by the construction in M2n\u22121,2m\u22121. In particular, if X is a minimal\nfeedback vertex set of Mn,m of size lbn,m then E(X) is a minimal feedback vertex\nset of M2n\u22121,2m\u22121 of size lb2n\u22121,2m\u22121. The feedback vertex set of M5,5 shown in\nFig. 7 is minimal (and has size lb5,5), thus we have effectively constructed minimal\nfeedback vertex sets in all grids M2r+1,2r+1, for r \u2265 2. Our construction generalizes,\nyet simplifies, the construction of Luccio in [5].\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n2 30 1 6 74 5 8\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n2 30 1 4\nFigure 7. Expanding a grid with a feedback vertex set.\nLet us now return to M3,2r\u22121, where r \u2265 2. As M3,2r\u22121 = E(M2,r), we immedi-\nately obtain an upper bound of \u2308\n3(r \u2212 1)\n2\n\u2309\nfor \u03c4(M3,2r\u22121).\nConsider the grid M3,5 and how many of the vertices in columns 0, 1, 2 and 3\nmust necessarily lie in a minimal feedback vertex set of M3,5: a simple case-by-case\nanalysis yields that at least 3 such vertices must do so. Divide M3,2r\u22121, where r \u2265 3,\ninto copies of M3,5, the first copy consisting of the vertices in columns 0, 1, 2, 3 and\n4, the second copy of vertices in columns 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, the third copy of vertices\nin columns 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12, and so on. By above, at least 3 of the vertices of any\nfeedback vertex set of M3,2r\u22121 must lie in columns 0, 1, 2 and 3, at least 3 must lie\nin columns 4, 5, 6 and 7, at least 3 must lie in columns 8, 9, 10 and 11, and so on.\nHence, if r \u2265 3 is odd then\n\u03c4(M3,2r\u22121) \u2265\n3(2r \u2212 2)\n4\n=\n3(r \u2212 1)\n2\n,\nand if r \u2265 4 is even then\n\u03c4(M3,2r\u22121) \u2265\n3(2r \u2212 4)\n4\n+ 2 =\n\u2308\n3(r \u2212 1)\n2\n\u2309\n13\n(in the latter case, we divide M3,2r\u22121 into copies of M3,5 and we need at least 2\nvertices to break cycles involving vertices in the \u2018left-over\u2019 columns indexed by 2r\u22124,\n2r \u2212 3 and 2r \u2212 2). Thus, when r \u2265 3,\n\u03c4(M3,2r\u22121) =\n\u2308\n3(r \u2212 1)\n2\n\u2309\n.\nTrivially, when r \u2265 3,\u2308\n3(r \u2212 1)\n2\n\u2309\n\u2264 \u03c4(M3,2r) \u2264\n\u2308\n3(r \u2212 1)\n2\n\u2309\n+ 1\n(simply consider the copy of M3,2r\u22121 induced by the vertices of M3,2r in columns\n0, 1, . . . , 2r \u2212 2).\n3.3 Grids with 5 rows\nFinally, we are left with the grids {M5,n : n \u2265 5}. The methods above do not suffice\nto deal with this case and we need to examine the situation in more detail.\nWe can decompose a grid M5,n in two ways. First, we consider M5,n to be the\nconcatenation of the grid M5,p and the grid M5,q, where n = p + q (the two smaller\ngrids have no vertices in common and vertices in the rightmost column of M5,p are\njoined to their corresponding vertices in the leftmost column of M5,q). In this case,\nwe write M5,n =M5,p+M5,q, and clearly we have that \u03c4(M5,n) \u2265 \u03c4(M5,p)+ \u03c4(M5,q).\nSecond, we shall considerM5,n to be the fusion ofM5,p andM5,q, where n = p+q\u22121,\nby identifying the vertices in the rightmost column of M5,p with their corresponding\nvertices in the leftmost column of M5,q. In this case, we write M5,n =M5,p \u2295M5,q.\nSuppose that we have a decomposition of M5,n (as a concatenation or a fusion)\ninto M5,p and M5,q, and partial feedback vertex sets in both M5,p and M5,q (that is,\ndesignated sets of vertices). We call a grid together with a partial feedback vertex\nset a tile. If M5,n is the concatenation of M5,p and M5,q, and these two grids have\npartial feedback vertex sets X and Y , respectively, so that we denote these tiles as\nMX5,p and M\nY\n5,q, then we obtain, in the natural way, a partial feedback vertex set of\nM5,n. If M5,n is the fusion of M\nX\n5,p and M\nY\n5,q then we obtain a partial feedback vertex\nset of M5,n, again in the natural way, except that we include any vertex of the fused\ncolumn of M5,n in our partial feedback vertex set if its image in M5,p is in X or its\nimage in M5,q is in Y (and ignore duplications). We call our fusion compatible if the\nvertices of X in the fused column of M5,p correspond exactly to the vertices of Y in\nthe fused column of M5,q.\nWe shall prove the following result by induction on n.\nProposition 2 When n \u2265 2, \u03c4(M5,n) = 11\n\u230a\nn\n8\n\u230b\n+\n\u230a\n3\n2 (n mod 8)\n\u230b\n\u2212 1.\n3.3.1 The base cases of the induction\nCase (i) The grids M5,2 and M5,3.\nIt is not difficult to see that \u03c4(M5,2) = 2 and \u03c4(M5,3) = 3. All minimal feedback\nvertex sets are depicted in Fig. 8, up to isomorphism.\n14\nFigure 8. The minimal feedback vertex sets of M5,2 and M5,3.\nCase (ii) The grid M5,4.\nWe have that lb5,4 = 5, and it is not difficult to show that \u03c4(M5,4) = 5; all minimal\nfeedback vertex sets are depicted in Fig. 9, up to isomorphism (these feedback vertex\nsets have been generated by hand and checked by computer, and will be required\nlater).\nCase (iii) The grid M5,5.\nWe have that lb5,5 = 6, and it is not difficult to show that \u03c4(M5,5) = 6 (see Fig. 12\nwhere we show some minimal feedback vertex sets ofM5,5, which we shall need later).\nCase (iv) The grid M5,6.\nWe have that lb5,6 = 7. Let Z be a minimal feedback vertex set of M5,6 and suppose\nthat |Z| = 7. Decompose M5,6 as M5,2 +M5,4. From above, there must be 2 vertices\nof Z in the first two columns and 5 vertices of Z in the final 4 columns. In particular,\nthe minimal feedback vertex set induced onM5,2 must be isomorphic to one in Fig. 8,\nand the minimal feedback vertex set induced on M5,4 must be isomorphic to one in\nFig. 9. By going through the possibilities of juxtaposing minimal feedback vertex sets\nfrom Figs. 8 and 9, it is easy to see that we obtain a contradiction. Hence, \u03c4(M5,6) = 8\nwith a typical minimal feedback vertex set given in Fig. 10.\nCase (v) The grid M5,7.\nWe have that lb5,7 = 8. Let Z be a minimal feedback vertex set of M5,7 and suppose\nthat |Z| = 8. Decompose M5,7 as M5,3 +M5,4. Proceeding as in the previous case\nbut juxtaposing the minimal feedback vertex sets of M5,3 instead of M5,2 yields a\ncontradiction. Hence, \u03c4(M5,7) = 9 with a typical minimal feedback vertex set given\nin Fig. 10.\nCase (vi) The grid M5,8.\nWe have lb5,8 = 10 and a feedback vertex set realizing this bound is shown in Fig. 11.\nLet us go further. DecomposeM5,8 asM5,4+M5,4 and let Z be any minimal feedback\nvertex set of M5,8. By above, there must be 5 vertices of Z in the first 4 columns of\nM5,8 and 5 in the last 4 columns. Also, decompose M5,8 as M5,2 +M5,6. By above,\nthere must be 2 vertices of Z in the first 2 columns of M5,8 and (symmetrically) 2\nin the last 2 columns. Taking this into consideration and trying all possible pairs of\nminimal feedback vertex sets of M5,4 from Fig. 9 yields that there are no vertices of\nZ in the leftmost or rightmost column of M5,8. We shall require this fact later.\nHaving dealt with the base cases, we will require later one more result regarding\nM5,9.\n15\nFigure 9. The minimal feedback vertex sets of M5,4.\nFigure 10. Minimal feedback vertex sets of M5,6 and M5,7.\n16\nFigure 11. Minimal feedback vertex sets of M5,8 and M5,9.\nLemma 3 Up to isomorphism, there is exactly one minimal feedback vertex set of\nM5,9, namely that shown in Fig. 11.\nProof Let Z be a minimal feedback vertex set of M5,9. By above, the number of\nvertices, a, of Z in the first 4 columns is at least 5, the number of vertices, b, of Z in\nthe last 4 columns is at least 5 and the number of vertices of Z in the first 5 columns\nis at least 6 (with |Z| = 11). The only solution is that a = b = 5 and that there\nis 1 vertex of Z in the 5th column. Given that \u03c4(M5,5) = 6 and \u03c4(M5,9) = 11, we\nmust have that MZ5,9 = M\nX\n5,5 \u2295M\nY\n5,5, where this fusion is compatible. The different\nsituations where we have a minimal feedback vertex set of M5,5 with exactly 1 vertex\nof the feedback set in the rightmost column are given in Fig. 12 (to see that this is\nthe case, use the classification given in Fig. 9). It is immediate that the only possible\nminimal feedback vertex set of M5,9 is that shown in Fig. 11 (up to isomorphism).\nFigure 12. The minimal feedback vertex sets of M5,5\nwith 1 vertex in the rightmost column.\n3.3.2 The inductive step\nHaving dealt with the base cases, we now prove the following result by induction.\nProposition 2 is an immediate corollary of the bounds just established and Proposi-\ntion 4.\nProposition 4 For all p \u2265 0 and so long as the grid has at least 2 columns, we have\nthat :\n17\n\u03c4(M5,8p) = 11p\u2212 1; \u03c4(M5,8p+1) = 11p; \u03c4(M5,8p+2) = 11p+ 2\n\u03c4(M5,8p+3) = 11p+ 3; \u03c4(M5,8p+4) = 11p+ 5; \u03c4(M5,8p+5) = 11p+ 6\n\u03c4(M5,8p+6) = 11p+ 8; \u03c4(M5,8p+7) = 11p+ 9.\nMoreover, any minimal feedback vertex set Z of M5,8p or M5,8p+1, for p \u2265 1, is such\nthat neither the rightmost nor leftmost column contains a vertex of Z.\nProof The base cases tell us that the result is true when p = 0, and also that\nM5,8 and M5,9 are such that neither the rightmost nor leftmost column of these grids\ncontains a vertex of any minimal feedback vertex set. Suppose, as our induction\nhypothesis, that the result holds for some p \u2265 0. Denote the bound given for \u03c4(M5,j)\nin the statement of the proposition by the function f(j), for all j \u2265 2.\nFix i \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , 7}. Let X be a minimal feedback vertex set of M5,8p+i. The\nfusion of the tile MX5,8p+i and the tile M\nY\n5,9 depicted in Fig. 11 results in a feedback\nvertex set Z of M5,8(p+1)+i of size |X|+ 11 (note that the fusion results in no cycles\nas there are no paths in MY5,9 from a vertex in the leftmost column to another vertex\nin the leftmost column which include vertices not in the leftmost column). By the\ninduction hypothesis, \u03c4(M5,8(p+1)+i) \u2264 f(8p+ i) + 11 = f(8(p+ 1) + i).\nConsider M5,8(p+1). As M5,8(p+1) =M5,8p+2 +M5,6, we have that \u03c4(M5,8(p+1)) \u2265\n\u03c4(M5,8p+2) + \u03c4(M5,6); consequently, by the induction hypothesis, \u03c4(M5,8(p+1)) \u2265\n(11p+ 2) + 8 = 11(p+ 1)\u2212 1, as required.\nLet Z be some minimal feedback vertex set of M5,8(p+1) (and so Z has size 11p+\n10). Suppose that column 8p has a vertex of Z in it. By the induction hypothesis\napplied to the first 8p+ 1 columns, these columns contain at least 11p vertices of Z.\nHowever, if they contain exactly 11p vertices of Z then, by the induction hypothesis,\nwe obtain a contradiction (as at least one vertex of Z lies in the rightmost of these\n8p+ 1 columns). Hence, the first 8p+ 1 columns contain at least 11p+ 1 vertices of\nZ, with the last 7 columns of M5,8(p+1) containing at most 9 vertices of Z. By the\ninduction hypothesis, the last 7 columns of M5,8(p+1) must contain exactly 9 vertices\nof Z, with the first 8p+1 columns of M5,8(p+1) containing exactly 11p+1 vertices of\nZ.\nIf columns 8p, 8p+1, . . . , 8p+7 of M5,8(p+1) contain 10 vertices of Z then we have\na minimal feedback vertex set of M5,8 with a vertex of the feedback vertex set in the\nleftmost column, which yields a contradiction. Hence, columns 8p, 8p+ 1, . . . , 8p+ 7\ncontain at least 11 vertices of Z, with column 8p containing at least 2 vertices of Z\nand with the first 8p columns of M5,8(p+1) containing at most 11p \u2212 1 vertices of Z.\nBy the induction hypothesis, the first 8p columns of M5,8(p+1) contain exactly 11p\u22121\nvertices of Z and there is no vertex of Z in column 8p \u2212 1. By Lemma 3 applied to\nthe last 9 columns of M5,8(p+1), there is no vertex of Z in the rightmost column of\nM5,8(p+1).\nAlternatively, suppose that column 8p contains no vertex of Z. By the induction\nhypothesis, the first 8p + 1 columns of M5,8(p+1) contain at least 11p vertices of Z\nand the last 8 columns of M5,8(p+1) contain at least 10 vertices of Z. Thus, the first\n8p columns of M5,8(p+1) contain exactly 11p vertices of Z and the last 8 columns\ncontain exactly 10 vertices of Z. By the induction hypothesis (applied to the last 8\ncolumns of M5,8(p+1)), there is no vertex of Z in the rightmost column of M5,8(p+1).\nA symmetric argument holds for the leftmost column of M5,8(p+1).\n18\nConsider M5,8(p+1)+1. As M5,8(p+1)+1 = M5,8p+2 +M5,7, just as above we have\n\u03c4(M5,8(p+1)+1) \u2265 \u03c4(M5,8p+2) + \u03c4(M5,7); consequently, by the induction hypothesis,\n\u03c4(M5,8(p+1)+1) \u2265 (11p+ 2) + 9 = 11(p+ 1), as required.\nLet Z be a minimal feedback vertex set of M5,8(p+1)+1. Suppose that there is at\nleast 1 vertex of Z in column 8p. An identical argument to that above shows that:\ncolumn 8p \u2212 1 contains no vertices of Z; column 8p contains 2 vertices of Z; and\ncolumns 8p+1, 8p+2, . . . , 8p+8 contain 10 vertices of Z. If the rightmost column of\nM5,8(p+1)+1 contains no vertex of Z then we are done; so, assume that the rightmost\ncolumn of M5,8(p+1)+1 contains at least 1 vertex of Z. By the induction hypothesis,\ncolumns 8p\u2212 1, 8p, . . . , 8p+7 contain 11 vertices of Z and column 8p+7 contains no\nvertices of Z. This yields a contradiction as column 8p+8 ofM5,8(p+1)+1 must contain\nexactly 1 vertex of Z and Z is supposed to be a feedback vertex set of M5,8(p+1)+1.\nAlternatively, suppose that there are no vertices of Z in column 8p. An identical\nargument to that above shows that there is no vertex of Z in the rightmost column\nof M5,8(p+1)+1. A symmetric argument holds for the leftmost column of M5,8(p+1)+1.\nConsider M5,8(p+1)+2. As M5,8(p+1)+2 = M5,8p+6 +M5,4, just as above we have\n\u03c4(M5,8(p+1)+2) \u2265 \u03c4(M5,8p+6) + \u03c4(M5,4); consequently, by the induction hypothesis,\n\u03c4(M5,8(p+1)+2) \u2265 (11p+ 8) + 5 = 11(p+ 1) + 2, as required.\nConsider M5,8(p+1)+3. As M5,8(p+1)+3 = M5,8p+6 +M5,5, just as above we have\n\u03c4(M5,8(p+1)+3) \u2265 \u03c4(M5,8p+6) + \u03c4(M5,5); consequently, by the induction hypothesis,\n\u03c4(M5,8(p+1)+3) \u2265 (11p+ 8) + 6 = 11(p+ 1) + 3, as required.\nConsider M5,8(p+1)+4. As M5,8(p+1)+4 = M5,8p+6 +M5,6, just as above we have\n\u03c4(M5,8(p+1)+4) \u2265 \u03c4(M5,8p+6) + \u03c4(M5,6); consequently, by the induction hypothesis,\n\u03c4(M5,8(p+1)+4) \u2265 (11p+ 8) + 8 = 11(p+ 1) + 5, as required.\nConsider M5,8(p+1)+5. As M5,8(p+1)+5 = M5,8p+6 +M5,7, just as above we have\n\u03c4(M5,8(p+1)+5) \u2265 \u03c4(M5,8p+6) + \u03c4(M5,7); consequently, by the induction hypothesis,\n\u03c4(M5,8(p+1)+5) \u2265 (11p+ 8) + 9 = 11(p+ 1) + 6, as required.\nConsider M5,8(p+1)+6. As M5,8(p+1)+6 = M5,8(p+1) +M5,6, just as above we have\n\u03c4(M5,8(p+1)+6) \u2265 \u03c4(M5,8(p+1)) + \u03c4(M5,6); consequently, by above, \u03c4(M5,8(p+1)+6) \u2265\n(11(p+1)\u2212 1) + 8 = 11(p+1)+ 7. Suppose that \u03c4(M5,8(p+1)+6) = 11(p+1)+ 7 and\nlet Z be a minimal feedback vertex set of M5,8(p+1)+6. The first 8(p + 1) columns\nof the tile MZ5,8(p+1)+6 yield a minimal feedback vertex set X of M5,8(p+1) and the\nlast 6 columns a minimal feedback vertex set Y of M5,6. By above, column 8(p+ 1)\ncontains no vertices of X; hence, column 8(p + 1) + 1 contains at least 2 vertices\nof Y . As \u03c4(M5,5) = 6, column 8(p + 1) + 1 must contain exactly 2 vertices of Y .\nColumn 8(p + 1) + 2 contains at least 1 vertex of Y , as otherwise there would be a\ncycle involving vertices on columns 8(p + 1), 8(p + 1) + 1 and 8(p + 1) + 2. Also, as\n\u03c4(M5,4) = 5, column 8(p + 1) + 2 must contain exactly 1 vertex of Y . Hence, the\nrightmost 5 columns ofMZ5,8(p+1)+6 induce a minimal feedback vertex set ofM5,5 with\n1 vertex in column 8(p + 1) + 2. Such minimal feedback vertex sets are classified in\nFig. 12 and it is easy to see that no matter which of the minimal feedback vertex sets\nwe try, we obtain a contradiction (this is even more apparent given that there is only\none configuration for the vertices in columns 8(p + 1) + 1 and 8(p + 1) + 2). Hence,\n\u03c4(M5,8(p+1)+6) = 11(p+ 1) + 8 as required.\nConsider M5,8(p+1)+7. As M5,8(p+1)+7 = M5,8(p+1)+1 + M5,6, just as above we\nhave \u03c4(M5,8(p+1)+7) \u2265 \u03c4(M5,8(p+1)+1) + \u03c4(M5,6); consequently, by the induction hy-\npothesis, \u03c4(M5,8(p+1)+7) \u2265 11(p+1)+8. Suppose that \u03c4(M5,8(p+1)+7) = 11(p+1)+8.\n19\nReasoning almost identically to as in the previous case yields a contradiction. Hence,\n\u03c4(M5,8(p+1)+7) = 11(p+ 1) + 9, as required. The result follows by induction.\nConsequently, we can draw all our results together in the following theorem.\nTheorem 5 There exists a computable function f(n,m) such that the size of a min-\nimal feedback vertex set of the grid Mn,m, where (n,m) \u2208 {(n,m) : n \u2265 2,m \u2265 2}, is\none of f(n,m), f(n,m) + 1 or f(n,m) + 2.\nOf course, the word \u2018computable\u2019, whilst strictly correct, is somewhat inappropri-\nate as the function f can be described very concisely according to the different cases\narising in this section. Also, \u03c4(Mn,m) is known exactly for a lot of different cases.\n4 Feedback vertex sets in butterflies\nIn this section, we improve known bounds on the size of minimal feedback vertex sets\nin butterflies. We begin with some basic structural decompositions.\nIf 0 \u2264 j \u2264 2d \u2212 1 then denote by bit(d, j) the bit-string of length d that is the\nbinary representation of j. Also, for any bit-string b of length d, denote by bin(b)\nthe integer whose binary representation as a bit string of length d is b. For any two\nbit-strings b and b\u2032, denote the concatenation of b and b\u2032 as bb\u2032.\nFix some d \u2265 2. Let b be a bit-string whose length, |b|, is at least 1 and at most\nd \u2212 1. Define the subgraph Bbd of Bd as the subgraph of Bd induced by the vertices\nof the set\n{vi,j : |b| \u2264 i \u2264 d, 0 \u2264 j \u2264 2\nd \u2212 1, j \u2261 bin(b) mod 2|b|};\nthat is, the vertices on rows |b|, |b| + 1, . . . , d whose column names (when written in\nbinary) end in b. The sub-graphs B14 (with edges in bold) and B\n10\n4 (with dashed\nedges) are illustrated in Fig. 13.\nLemma 6 Let d \u2265 2 and let b be a bit-string whose length is at least 1 and at\nmost d \u2212 1. The subgraph Bbd of Bd is isomorphic to Bd\u2212|b| via the isomorphism\n\u03b2b : Bd\u2212|b| \u2192 B\nb\nd given by \u03b2b(vi,j) = vi\u2032,j\u2032 , with i\n\u2032 = i+ |b| and j\u2032 = bit(d\u2212 |b|, j)b.\nProof For B0d and B\n1\nd (that is, for the bit-strings b = 0 and b = 1), the definition\nof Bd yields the result. For other bit-strings, the result then follows by a simple\ninduction.\nLemma 7 Let d \u2265 2 and let the set of vertices U of Bd be defined as {vi,j : 0 \u2264 i \u2264\nd \u2212 1, 0 \u2264 j \u2264 2d \u2212 1}. The subgraph Bd[U ] of Bd consists of two disjoint copies B\nl\nd\nand Brd of Bd\u22121 where the isomorphisms \u03b2l : Bd\u22121 \u2192 B\nl\nd and \u03b2r : Bd\u22121 \u2192 B\nr\nd are\ngiven by \u03b2l(vi,j) = vi,j and \u03b2r(vi,j) = vi,j+2d\u22121 .\nProof Immediate from the definition of Bd.\nWe are now in a position to improve the lower bound on the size of a minimal\nfeedback vertex set of Bd as established in [1], namely\nlbCKKd =\n(d\u2212 1)2d + 1\n3\n.\n20\n0000\n0001\n0\n1\n2\n4\n3\n0010\n0011\n0100\n0101\n0110\n0111\n1000\n1001\n1010\n1001\n1100\n1101\n1110\n1111\nFigure 13. Butterflies contained within butterflies.\nOur improvement is obtained by refining the general theorem used in [1] to obtain\nthis lower bound.\nProposition 8 Let G = (V,E) be a graph of maximal degree \u03b4 and let F be a feedback\nvertex set of G, with H the subgraph G\\F . Let Fi be the set of vertices in F of degree\ni in G, let P be the set of edges of G induced by the vertices of F and let c be the\nnumber of connected components of H. Then\n|E| \u2212 (\u03a3\u03b4i=1i|Fi|) + |P | = |V | \u2212 |F | \u2212 c.\nProof The number of edges of E incident with a vertex of F is\n(\u03a3\u03b4i=1i|Fi|)\u2212 |P |.\nAs F is a feedback vertex set, H is a forest and so the number of edges of H is equal\nto the number of vertices of H minus c; that is,\n|E| \u2212 (\u03a3\u03b4i=1i|Fi|) + |P | = |V | \u2212 |F | \u2212 c\nand the result follows.\nBy applying Proposition 8 to Bd, we obtain that (with the definitions as in the\nstatement of Proposition 8),\n3|F | \u2212 2|F2| = (d\u2212 1)2\nd + |P |+ c.\nNote that as |P | and |F2| are at least 0 and c is at least 1, we obtain the lower bound\nlbCKKd on the size of a feedback vertex set of Bd, as was done in [1].\nHowever, we can use Proposition 8 to obtain an improved lower bound on the size\nof a feedback vertex set of Bd.\nProposition 9 Let d \u2265 4. Any feedback vertex set of Bd has size at least\n(d\u2212 1)2d + 4\n3\n.\n21\nProof Consider Bd, for d \u2265 4, and let F be a minimal feedback vertex set of Bd.\nLet H be the subgraph Bd \\F of Bd. We may assume that there are no vertices of F\non row 0 nor on row d (as if, for example, the vertex v0,0 is in F then we can replace\nv0,0 in F with the vertex v1,0 and still obtain a minimal feedback vertex set).\nBy Lemma 7, the subgraphs Bld and B\nr\nd of Bd are isomorphic to Bd\u22121. Also, as\nevery cycle (of length 4) in Bd involving only vertices on rows d\u22121 and d must contain\nat least one vertex of F (with such a vertex of F being on row d\u22121), there is no path\nin Bd \\ F from a vertex of B\nl\nd \\ F to a vertex of B\nr\nd \\ F (also, note that B\nl\nd \\ F and\nBrd \\ F are both non-empty, as no vertex on row 0 is in F ).\nConsider Bld. By Lemma 6, B\nl\nd\u2229B\n0\nd andB\nl\nd\u2229B\n1\nd are isomorphic to Bd\u22122. Moreover,\nas every cycle (of length 4) in Bd involving only vertices on rows 0 and 1 must contain\nat least one vertex of F (with such a vertex of F being on row 1), there is no path\nin Bd \\ F from a vertex of B\nl\nd \u2229 B\n0\nd to a vertex of B\nl\nd \u2229 B\n1\nd. Furthermore, as d \u2265 4,\nboth (Bld \u2229 B\n0\nd) \\ F and (B\nl\nd \u2229 B\n1\nd) \\ F are non-empty. Similar reasoning applies to\n(Brd \u2229 B\n0\nd) \\ F and (B\nr\nd \u2229 B\n1\nd) \\ F . Thus, Bd \\ F consists of at least 4 connected\ncomponents. Putting c \u2265 4 into the equation in Proposition 8 (with G taken as Bd)\nyields the result.\nSo, if we denote our new lower bound from Proposition 9 as lbd then we have that\nlbd = lb\nCKK\nd + 1. Whilst our lower bound improvement is somewhat slight, we can\nmake a more significant improvement on the best known upper bound on the size of\na minimal feedback vertex set of Bd.\nDefinition 10 Define\nVl = V (B\nl\nd) = {vi,j : 0 \u2264 i \u2264 d\u2212 1, 0 \u2264 j \u2264 2\nd\u22121 \u2212 1},\nVr = V (B\nr\nd) = {vi,j : 0 \u2264 i \u2264 d\u2212 1, 2\nd\u22121 \u2264 j \u2264 2d \u2212 1}\nand\nVd = {vd,j : 0 \u2264 j \u2264 2\nd \u2212 1},\nfor all d \u2265 1.\nNote that V (Bd) = Vd \u222a Vl \u222a Vr.\nDefinition 11 Define\nV 1d\u22121 = {vd\u22121,j : 0 \u2264 j \u2264 2\nd\u22122 \u2212 1},\nV 2d\u22121 = {vd\u22121,j : 2\nd\u22122 \u2264 j \u2264 2d\u22121 \u2212 1},\nV 3d\u22121 = {vd\u22121,j : 2\nd\u22121 \u2264 j \u2264 3 \u00b7 2d\u22122 \u2212 1},\nV 4d\u22121 = {vd\u22121,j : 3 \u00b7 2\nd\u22122 \u2264 j \u2264 2d \u2212 1},\nfor all d > 1.\nDefinition 12 Define\nVl,0 = {vi,j : 0 \u2264 i \u2264 d\u2212 2, 0 \u2264 j \u2264 2\nd\u22122 \u2212 1},\nVl,1 = {vi,j : 0 \u2264 i \u2264 d\u2212 2, 2\nd\u22122 \u2264 j \u2264 2d\u22121 \u2212 1},\nVr,0 = {vi,j : 0 \u2264 i \u2264 d\u2212 2, 2\nd\u22121 \u2264 j \u2264 3 \u00b7 2d\u22122 \u2212 1},\nVr,1 = {vi,j : 0 \u2264 i \u2264 d\u2212 2, 3 \u00b7 2\nd\u22122 \u2264 j \u2264 2d \u2212 1},\nfor all d > 1.\n22\nNote that Bd[Vl,0], Bd[Vl,1], Bd[Vr,0] and Bd[Vr,1] are (d\u2212 2)-dimensional butter-\nflies.\nWe illustrate the above definitions in Figs. 14 and 15, where as well as showing the\ndecomposition of the butterflies B5 and B6 into their constituent parts, we also detail\ntwo particular feedback vertex sets. We shall use these feedback vertex sets presently\nand consequently we name them as FB(B5) and FB(B6), respectively.

(Readers might find it in-\nstructive to first of all convince themselves that there are no cycles involving only\nvertices on two subsequent levels, and then to rule out potential cycles involving ver-\ntices on the bottom two levels, then cycles involving vertices on the penultimate and\nantepenultimate levels, and so on.)\nWe are now in a position to detail our algorithm. Our algorithm outputs a feedback\nvertex set for Bd which we denote FB(Bd), and we denote the feedback vertex sets of\nBd resulting from Algorithms A and L, in [2], by FA(Bd) and FL(Bd), respectively\n(recall, Algorithm A is Chang, Lin and Lee\u2019s algorithm and Algorithm L is Luccio\u2019s\nalgorithm, first derived in [5]).\nAlgorithm B\nInput: The d-dimensional butterfly Bd, where d \u2265 0.\nOutput: The feedback vertex set FB(Bd) of Bd.\nIf d \u2208 {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} then return FB(Bd) = FA(Bd)\nelse if d = 5 then return FB(B5)\nelse if d = 6 then return FB(B6)\n23\nelse return FB(Bd) = (V\n2\nd\u22121 \u222a FB(Bd[Vl,0]) \u222a FL(Bd[Vl,1]))\n\u222a(V 3d\u22121 \u222a FL(Bd[Vr,0]) \u222a FB(Bd[Vr,1])).\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nrow\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nrow\nleft-hand side of 6-dimensional butterfly\nright-hand side of 6-dimensional butterfly\nedges joining \nvertices on \nrows 5 and 6 \nomitted from \nfigure\nedges joining \nvertices on \nrows 5 and 6 \nomitted from \nfigure\nB [V   ]6 l,0\nB [V   ]6 l,1\nB [V   ]6 r,0 B [V   ]6 r,1\nV 6\n1 V 6\n2\nV 6\n3\nV6\n4\nFigure 15. The butterfly B6 with the feedback vertex set FB(B6).\nThat is, we proceed just as Chang, Lin and Lee did except the base cases of our\nrecursive algorithm are different. The fact that our algorithm produces a feedback\nvertex set follows from the following lemmas from [2].\nLemma 13 [2] For d > 1, suppose that Fl,0 is a feedback vertex set of Bd[Vl,0] and\nthat Fl,1 = FL(Bd[Vl,1]). Then Fl,0 \u222a Fl,1 \u222a V\n2\nd\u22121 is a feedback vertex set of Bd[Vl].\n24\nLemma 14 [2] For d > 1, suppose that Fr,0 = FL(Bd[Vr,0]) and that Fr,1 is a\nfeedback vertex set of Bd[Vr,1]. Then Fr,0 \u222a Fr,1 \u222a V\n3\nd\u22121 is a feedback vertex set of\nBd[Vr].\nLemma 15 [2] For d > 1, suppose that Fl \u2287 V\n2\nd\u22121 and that Fr \u2287 V\n3\nd\u22121 are feedback\nvertex sets of Bd[Vl] and Bd[Vr], respectively. Then Fl \u222aFr is a feedback vertex set of\nBd.\nTheorem 16 The set FB(Bd) is a feedback vertex set of Bd.\nProof The proof follows from an elementary induction using the above lemmas.\nNot only can we use Chang, Lin and Lee\u2019s tools to prove that our algorithm is\ncorrect, we can also use their analysis to obtain the size of the feedback vertex set\nFB(Bd), for each d \u2265 5.\nFrom [2], the size fA(d) of the feedback vertex set FA(Bd) is\u230a\n(3d+ 1)2d + 1\n9\n\u230b\n\u2212\n2d \u2212 1\n3\n, if d is even,\nand \u230a\n(3d+ 1)2d + 1\n9\n\u230b\n\u2212\n2d \u2212 2\u2308\nd\n2 \u2309 \u2212 2\u230a\nd\n2 \u230b + 1\n3\n, if d is odd.\nConsequently, fA(5) = 50 and fA(6) = 114; whereas, with fB(d) denoting the size of\nthe feedback vertex set FB(Bd) produced by Algorithm B, fB(5) = 48 and fB(6) =\n110.\nA simple observation yields that\nfA(7)\u2212 fB(7) = 4;\nfA(8)\u2212 fB(8) = 8;\nfA(9)\u2212 fB(9) = 2(fA(7)\u2212 fB(7)) = 8;\nfA(10)\u2212 fB(10) = 2(fA(8)\u2212 fB(8)) = 16;\nfA(11)\u2212 fB(11) = 2(fA(9)\u2212 fB(9)) = 16;\nfA(12)\u2212 fB(12) = 2(fA(10)\u2212 fB(10)) = 32;\n. . .\nand a simple induction yields that fB(d) is equal to\u230a\n(3d+ 1)2d + 1\n9\n\u230b\n\u2212\n2d \u2212 1\n3\n\u2212 2\nd\u22122\n2 , if d \u2265 6 is even,\nand \u230a\n(3d+ 1)2d + 1\n9\n\u230b\n\u2212\n2d \u2212 2\u2308\nd\n2 \u2309 \u2212 2\u230a\nd\n2 \u230b + 1\n3\n\u2212 2\nd\u22123\n2 , if d \u2265 5 is odd.\nHence, the above are upper bounds on \u03c4(Bd).\n25\n5 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we have improved the known upper and lower bounds on the sizes of\nminimal feedback vertex sets in grids and butterflies. We feel that the closeness of the\nresulting upper and lower bounds in grids should essentially close the investigation.\nThe situation for butterflies is not so clear cut. Whilst we have managed to improve\nboth upper and lower bonds, there is still some distance between the two bounds.\nWe conjecture that the feedback vertex number for butterflies lies closer to our upper\nbound than our lower bound. Intuitively, we feel that our lower bound technique,\nwhich has only been applied at the \u2018extremities\u2019 of the butterfly, should be applicable\n\u2018within\u2019 the butterfly. Of course, we have so far been unable to do this.\nReferences\n[1] I. Caragiannis, C. Kaklamanis and P.
