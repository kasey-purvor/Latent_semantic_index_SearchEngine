The first,\nwhich we may call \u201ctop-down,\u201d is perhaps the more frequently encountered, and\nis the mainstay of Skinner\u2019s (1953) interpretations of economic, political and\nreligious life\u2014among other areas of application. It consists in suggesting\nsurrogates of the elements of the three- or four-term contingency that might\ncomprise responses of the kind controlled in the laboratory and the stimuli that\nwould control them in such a closed setting. The behavior under interpretation,\nwhich typically occurs in a much more open setting, is then described as though it\nwas predictable and controllable from a knowledge of the elements of the\nsituation that have been labeled establishing operations, discriminative stimuli,\nreinforcers and punishers.\nThis broad-brush mode of interpretation lacks the detailed knowledge of the\nworld that is to be interpreted, which is shown in the second kind of interpretive\napproach, \u201cbottom-up.\u201d This is the mode of interpretation more likely be devised\nby persons whose initial training and expertise lies not in behavior analysis but in\nanother sphere to which the concepts and, to some degree, the methods of\nbehavioral science are subsequently applied. Economists, political scientists,\nphilosophers and\u2014for the purposes of this paper\u2014marketing scientists might all\nlook to behavior analysis to provide a plausible interpretation of their subject\nmatter after they have mastered it, perhaps in terms of a theory quite distinct from\nthat of radical behaviorism. We do not know for sure how common this mode is\ncompared with top-down interpretation, but it is the method that brought\nconsumer behavior analysis into being and that which we describe in this paper.\nThe aim must often be, through sensitivity to the realities of the subject\nmatter, to introduce complexities of interpretation which could not have been\nanticipated by an experimentally-based analysis of behavior. The categories and\ndefinitions of variables used in experimental research may be insufficient to\naccount for the complexities of real-world behavior; this is a world the\npractitioners of the disciplines who study it centrally know better than the\nexperimentalists whose focus is entirely to be found within the lab. The extension\nof behavioral science concepts in this way is neither a deviation from nor a\ncorruption of behavior analysis; it is a means of enhancing both it and its\nrelevance to the world of social issues.\nIn this paper, we show a conceptual framework that can be used to interpret\nconsumer behavior that harms the environment and discuss its empirical\nconfirmation in the sphere of consumer behavior generally. We will also indicate\nCONSUMER BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS AND SOCIAL MARKETING\n103\nhow it may be applied to and actively employed in social marketing programs\naimed at the conservation of natural resources.\nCONSUMER BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS AND THE BPM\nConsumer behavior analysis has the agenda of applying basic behavioral laws\nand principles to real life consumer behavior. In doing this consumer behavior\nanalysis models should be more able to accurately describe, predict and affect\nconsumers. However, adding in the real life effects of consumer behavior will\ncertainly make the resulting models more complicated.\n One peculiar characteristic of consumer behavior is the fact it is usually\nsimultaneously \u201creinforced\u201d and \u201cpunished.\u201d It can be reinforced by the benefits\nobtained from products and services or by social approval, but it is simultaneously\npunished because the consumer has to surrender generalized conditioned\nreinforcers, such as money and rights, and to spend time and effort in the\npurchasing process (cf. Alhadeff, 1982). The Behavioral Perspective Model\n(BPM) is an operant framework for the interpretation of consumer behavior that\ntakes into account this peculiarity by describing consumer behavior as a function\nof its consequences. The model proposes that consumer behavior is jointly\ndetermined by the consumer-behavior setting and an individual\u2019s learning history\nof consumption. The setting contains events in the consumption environment that\nsignal the different consequences for different consumer responses. These events\nin the setting may be physical (e.g., alternative brands, point-of-sale\nadvertisement), social (e.g., other shoppers, store staff members), temporal (e.g.,\nstore opening hours, short-term promotions), and regulatory (e.g., rules\nconcerning shopping). They function as stimuli that signal to the consumer, based\non his or her past learning history, the kind of consequences that are likely to\nfollow each type of response, such as buying, postponing the purchase,\naccelerating the purchase, searching, and saving. One of the important dimensions\nof a consumer behavior setting is its scope, which can vary from relatively closed,\npresenting few alternatives to the consumer, to relatively open, presenting the\nconsumer with many alternatives.\nThe model proposes that consumer behavior produces both utilitarian and\ninformational consequences, both of which can be reinforcing or punishing.\nUtilitarian consequences are functional results of buying and using products and\nservices: they derive from the practical application of the product itself in some\nconsumption situation. They therefore reflect the value-in-use of a product or\nservice, the economic, pragmatic or material consequences derived from\nacquiring, owning, and using it. For instance, the utilitarian reinforcers of an\nextended holiday in an exotic location may be related to the rest, relaxation and\nFOXALL, OLIVEIRA-CASTRO ET AL.\n104\nrecuperation it provides. This type of holiday may also generate some punishing\nutilitarian consequences, such as having to face a long and tiring trip and spending\na lot of money.2 As another example, one of the main utilitarian reinforcing\nconsequences of owning a car is to be able to get door-to-door transportation,\nwhich any car can offer. Owning a car can also produce some punishing utilitarian\nconsequences such as having to deal with its eventual breakdowns.\nInformational consequences, however, are socially-derived and symbolic,\ndepending above all on the actions and reactions of other people. They may\nconsist of feedback on the performance of the individual as a consumer. They are\nverbal (or social) in the sense of being mediated by other persons (Skinner, 1957)\nand involve communication in the sense that behavior of one organism generates\na stimulus that affects the behavior of another organism (Baum, 2005). Thus,\nwhile utilitarian consequences are related to the technical functions of products or\nservices, informational consequences are related to social functions of acquiring\nand using products or services, such as social status and prestige associated to\ncertain consumer behavior patterns.\n An extended holiday on an exotic location may generate informational\nreinforcers such as the prestige and sense of accomplishment conferred by\nknowing that one can afford this kind of recreation and communicating the fact to\none\u2019s friends, who might make admiring comments over the fact. This type of\nconsumption may also produce informational punishers such as derisive\ncomments from others that consider it to be excessively expensive, snobbish or\nculturally meaningless. Owning a car may also generate reinforcing informational\nconsequences, such as the prestige associated to premium brands (e.g., buying a\nBentley), or punishers, such as ecological reprimands for having bought a high-\nconsumption sport utility vehicle.\n The model proposes that every consumer behavior produces both\ninformational and utilitarian consequences in variable levels. Keeping to the car\nexample, driving a Bentley or a Mercedes may offer its owner prestige and social\nstatus, in addition to door-to-door transportation. Owning a car itself,\nindependently of its make, might give its owner some social status, the degree of\nwhich will depend, primarily, upon the cultural and economic context in which\nthe individual lives. But, in that same context, owning a Bentley will probably\ngive its owner more social status than simply owing a common car. By the same\n                                                           \n2 Although the distinction between positive and negative reinforcement (and punishment) can be\nfound in the literature to refer to presentation or removal of reinforcers (and punishers),\nrespectively, the identification of such differences is not always easy and indisputable (cf. Catania,\n1998). Moreover, considering that the present paper deals primarily with behavior occurring in\nnatural, as opposed to experimental, settings, this distinction is not emphasized here.\nCONSUMER BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS AND SOCIAL MARKETING\n105\nFigure 1. Schematic representation of the Behavioral Perspective Model (BPM).\ntoken, a Bentley and a Mercedes will probably offer more utilitarian benefits (e.g.,\nsecurity items, longer warranty) than less prestigious makes, but even a Mercedes\nmay be acquired with more or fewer utilitarian reinforcers (e.g., air-conditioning,\nleather seats).\nThe contact with behavioral consequences forms the consumer\u2019s learning\nhistory of reinforcement and punishment in a given situation, which interacts with\nthe consumer behavior setting influencing the likelihood of a behavior taking\nplace in the same or similar situations in future occasions. Figure 1 shows a basic\nschematic representation of the BPM and will be returned to later.\nTHE USEFULNESS OF THE BPM IN INTERPRETING CONSUMER BEHAVIOR\nIn all the examples of informational and utilitarian reinforcers and punishers\ngiven so far, we referred to events that usually have reinforcing and punishing\nfunctions for most people. This does not imply these functions should not be\nempirically tested for \u201cthe only way to tell whether or not a given event is\nreinforcing to a given organism under given conditions is to make a direct test.\nWe observe the frequency of a selected response, then make an event contingent\nupon it and observe any change in frequency. If there is a change, we classify the\nevent as reinforcing to the organism under the existing conditions\u201d (Skinner,\n1953, p. 72-73).\n When dealing with consumer behavior, however, research and managerial\ninterests frequently lie in identifying what functions as reinforcement to large\ngroups of people and, in the large majority of cases, this has to be done on the\nbasis of observational, rather than experimental data. This may increase some\nFOXALL, OLIVEIRA-CASTRO ET AL.\n106\nalready existing ambiguities in defining different types of reinforcement. As there\ncan be ambiguity in analyzing reinforcement as positive and negative (e.g.,\nCatania, 1998) or as primary and secondary (e.g., Baum, 2005), there can also be\nambiguity in evaluating with precision the utilitarian and informational effects on\nconsumer behavior and their possible interactions. As applies to the terms of\npositive\/negative and primary\/secondary, the differentiation of utilitarian and\ninformational consequences should be used as long as it gives the researcher or\npractitioner economical and comprehensible descriptions of consumer behavior\n(cf. Baum, 2005). In what follows, we describe some research projects on\nconsumer behavior analysis that may illustrate the usefulness of distinguishing\nbetween utilitarian and informational consequences and of analyzing the scope of\nconsumer behavior setting.\nConsumer Brand Choice\nThe marketing literature suggests that, when purchasing fast moving\nconsumer goods (fmcgs), consumers have a repertoire of two to four brands in\neach product category from which they select, as if randomly, on each shopping\noccasion (cf. Ehrenberg, Uncles & Goodhardt, 2004). Early consumer behavior\nanalysis work studied the issue of repertoire buying through the development of\nmethodologies based on behavioral economics, specifically matching,\nmaximization and demand processes (see for example Foxall & James, 2001;\nFoxall & Schrezenmaier, 2003). In summary, the results suggested that consumers\nwill buy the cheapest brand within their repertoire although this is not always the\ncheapest of all the brands available. This indicates that brands within a given\nproduct category are not all functionally substitutable. One possible source of\nnon-substitutability among brand may be based on the level of utilitarian and\ninformational reinforcement (as discussed previously) they offer to consumers\n(Foxall, 1999).\nBrand Choice: Informational and Utilitarian Reinforcement\nBased on this distinction between utilitarian and informational reinforcement,\nwhich suggests different types of reinforcers influence consumer choices, Foxall,\nOliveira-Castro and Schrezenmaier (2004) examined whether consumers\u2019 brand\nrepertoires (patterns of repertoire buying as discussed above) are related to the\nlevels of utilitarian and informational reinforcement offered by the brands. The\nauthors based their analyses on purchase data from a sample of 80 consumers\nbuying nine products (i.e., baked beans, cookies, breakfast cereals, butter, cheese,\nfruit juice, instant coffee, margarine, and tea) during a period of 16 weeks. This\nCONSUMER BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS AND SOCIAL MARKETING\n107\n80-consumer sample was randomly selected from a national (UK) consumer panel\n(TNS Superpanel).3\n In order to investigate possible effects of informational and utilitarian\nreinforcement values on brand choice, the brands bought by the sample during the\n16-week period in each product category were classified according to the level of\ninformational and utilitarian reinforcement they offered. Brands and product\ncharacteristics found within supermarket product categories were interpreted as\nsets of programmed contingencies of reinforcement, which specify what\nresponses (e.g., how much one has to pay) are followed by what consequences\n(e.g., product characteristics). Most marketing activities, according to this\ninterpretation, are related to planning and programming reinforcement\ncontingencies for the behavior of consumers. Considering programmed\ncontingencies may not work as planned, empirical research is usually conducted\nto evaluate the actual effects of planned contingencies.\nAs there are no general units to measure utilitarian and informational\nreinforcement levels, a forced ranking system was adopted in which three\ninformational and two utilitarian levels were ascribed to each product category.\nUtilitarian levels were identified based on additional attributes (e.g., plain baked\nbeans vs. baked beans with sausage) and\/or differentiated types of products (e.g.,\ndigestive cookies4 vs. chocolate chip cookies). In the case of differentiated\nproduct types, several general brands usually offer the different product\nformulations, charging different prices for them (e.g., digestive cookies are\ncheaper than chocolate chip cookies for all brands examined).\nThe ranking of informational reinforcement level was based on the idea that\nthis is closely associated to brand differentiation, which in turn is usually also\nrelated to price differentiation. If one compares the level of brand differentiation\nof, for instance, Asda (Wal-Mart) Smart Price\u00a9 and Kellogg\u2019s\u00a9, as brands\nproducing breakfast cereals, Kellogg\u2019s\u00a9 is clearly a better known, more\ndifferentiated cereal brand. It also offers a more expensive product. This kind of\ndifference among brands was interpreted as differences in informational\nreinforcement level.\n                                                           \n3 Consumer panels consist of groups of volunteers that record their purchases and consumption of\ncertain product categories (e.g., supermarket products) and report such information to market\nresearch firms, who sell the data to retailers, producers and researchers. These panels are usually\nmaintained for several years and include representative samples of the target population (e.g., UK\nconsumers). Most current panels use automated recording systems (e.g., home scanner devices\nattached to a computer).\n4 Digestive cookies are semi-sweet biscuits made of wholemeal flour common in the UK.\nFOXALL, OLIVEIRA-CASTRO ET AL.\n108\nThe ranking of informational reinforcement level was based on the following\ngeneral criteria: 1) increases in prices across brands for the same product type\n(e.g., plain baked beans or plain cornflakes) were considered to be indicative of\ndifferences in informational levels; 2) the cheapest own brands5 (e.g., Asda Smart\nPrice\u00a9, Tesco Value\u00a9, Sainsbury Economy\u00a9) were considered to represent the\nlowest informational level (Level 1); 3) own brands that do not mention good\nvalue for money or economy (e.g., Asda\u00a9, Tesco\u00a9, Sainsbury\u00a9) and cheapest\nspecialized brands were usually considered to represent the medium informational\nlevel (Level 2); and 4) specialized brands, with higher prices (e.g., Heinz\u00a9,\nNescafe\u00a9), were considered to represent the highest informational level (Level 3).\nThe authors classified all brands according to these criteria and asked two\nindependent judges to do the same. The level of reliability of this classification\nwas satisfactory (more than 70% of brands across all products and the two judges\nwere classified under the same utilitarian\/informational level) (cf. Oliveira-Castro,\nFoxall & Schrezenmaier, 2005). Based on this classification, Foxall et al. (2004)\nobserved the majority of consumers made 70% or more of their purchases in each\nproduct category within brands belonging to the same informational level. The\nauthors reported similar findings for utilitarian level of reinforcement, where, for\nmost consumers (with the exception of cookies), 70% or more of purchases were\nconcentrated within brands at the same level of utilitarian reinforcement. These\nresults suggest that consumers\u2019 brand repertoires are chosen, at least in part, on\nthe basis of the level of informational and utilitarian reinforcement programmed\nby the brands.\nWhen consumers were classified in six different groups according to the\nutilitarian and informational level of the brands they bought mostly (Group 1:\nInformational Level 1 and Utilitarian Level 1 to Group 6: Informational Level 3\nand Utilitarian Level 2), Foxall et al. (2004) discovered that consumer groups\ndiffered with respect to their price demand elasticity.  That is, they differed with\nrespect to how much they changed the quantity they bought as a function of\nchanges in brand price. The group of consumers that bought mostly brands\nbelonging to the lowest level of utilitarian and informational reinforcement\n(Group 1) and the group that bought mostly brands belonging to the highest level\nof utilitarian and informational reinforcement (Group 6) showed the lowest\ndemand elasticities, that is, they showed the smallest decreases in quantity bought\nas a function of increases in brand price. Group 2 (Informational Level 1 and\n                                                           \n5 An own brand is a product manufactured specially for a retailer and bearing the retailer\u2019s name.\nThey are not available in any competing retail outlet unlike large brands, for example Heinz,\nwhich is available in most retailers. The equivalent in the US is a private brand (rather than a\nnational brand).\nCONSUMER BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS AND SOCIAL MARKETING\n109\nUtilitarian Level 2) showed the highest demand elasticity, which decreased\nsystematically as the group number increased (from 2 to 6).\nThe authors also decomposed overall group elasticities into intra-brand\nelasticity (buying larger quantities of Brand A when Brand A is cheaper), inter-\nbrand-utilitarian elasticity (buying smaller quantities of Brand B, which is more\nexpensive than Brand A and offers more utilitarian reinforcement), and inter-\nbrand-informational elasticity (buying smaller quantities of Brand C, which is\nmore expensive than Brand A and offers more informational reinforcement).\nTaken together, the results suggested the occurrence of at least three different\npatterns of brand choice across groups: 1) minimizing costs by choosing\npredominantly the cheapest brands independently of informational and utilitarian\nlevels (Group 1), 2) maximizing utilitarian reinforcement within each level of\ninformational reinforcement (Groups 2, 4 and 6), and 3) maximizing\ninformational reinforcement (Groups 2 to 6, increasingly) (cf. Foxall et al., 2004).\nFurther analyses of decomposed demand elasticity of all consumers also showed\nthat, for the nine supermarket food products investigated, intra-brand elasticity\nwas higher than utilitarian elasticity, which, in turn, was higher than informational\nelasticity (Oliveira-Castro et al., 2005). These results suggest that, for fast-moving\nconsumer goods of the type investigated here, consumers\u2019 brand choices are\ninfluenced by price, utilitarian reinforcement and informational reinforcement, in\nthat order of importance. Knowledge of the events that function as reinforcers for\nconsumers allows researchers and managers to make predictions about their\nbehavior.\nAnother method of measuring informational reinforcement level of brands\nwas developed by Oliveira-Castro, Pohl and Dias (2006). The authors elaborated\na simple questionnaire which asked consumers to rate, based on a four-point\nscale, the levels of popularity and quality of each brand within product categories.\nBy averaging the scores for popularity and quality, obtained across samples of\nmore than 120 consumers, the method ascribed a single score, ranging from 0 to\n3, to each brand. This final score has been interpreted as a measure of\ninformational reinforcement level of each brand, as perceived by consumers.\nAfter this, the authors examined the possible relations among brand market share,\nprice, and informational level for nine different supermarket products (i.e., fabric\nsoftener, laundry powder, coffee, margarine, canned corn, soy bean oil, chocolate\nmilk, black beans, and washing-up liquid).\nFor seven products, results showed significant, positively accelerated\nincreases in market share as a function of increases in informational level, and\nnon-significant decreases in market share with increases in prices (brand with\nhigher informational levels tended to have higher prices). Thus, for these seven\nFOXALL, OLIVEIRA-CASTRO ET AL.\n110\nproducts, increases in informational level were associated with positively\naccelerated increases in total brand revenue. For two other products (black beans\nand canned corn), neither market share nor prices were significantly related to\ninformational level. In other words, these two products behaved as primary\ncommodities, whose reinforcing value for the consumer does not increase with\nincreases in informational level (or brand differentiation). These results illustrate,\nonce more, the usefulness of the distinction between utilitarian and informational\nreinforcement proposed by the BPM, a model that provides a consistent\nconceptual framework for the interpretation of consumer behavior in general and\nthe identification of events that function as reinforcers for different groups of\npeople under different conditions.\nThe Scope of the Consumer Behavior Setting\nAlongside informational and utilitarian reinforcement, the scope of the\nbehavior setting is an important variable in the BPM. According to the BPM,\nbehavior is a function of the consumer situation. From the work of Schwartz and\nLacey (1988) it has been proposed that purchase and consumption activities occur\nin a continuum which ranges between relatively open to relatively closed\nconsumer behavior settings.\nA relatively closed setting is such as the post office in which the purchase of\ngovernment-issued postage stamps is the only means available to the consumer\nfor sending a written communication. On the other hand, a department store is\nmore characteristic of a relatively open setting where the consumer has a great\nrange of products to choose from. In the relatively closed setting, persons other\nthan the consumer arrange the discriminative stimuli that compose the setting in a\nway that compels conformity to the desired behavior, and this is achieved by\nmaking reinforcement contingent on such conformity. In this case, the consumer\nis acting according to the rules or instructions devised and presented by others in\norder to avoid or escape the aversive consequences she might face otherwise.\nConversely, the relatively open setting does not constrain the consumer, who,\nthus, has greater choices. Therefore, in this case, the consumer is acting on self-\ninstructions, under the control of positive reinforcement (feeling of freedom, a\nsense of being in personal control of his behavior) and in which his approach\nbehavior is difficult to predict (Skinner 1971). Also difficult in this environment\nis to isolate the positive reinforcers that might be the exact causes of the\nconsumer\u2019s current behavior.\nStudies testing the importance of scope in behavior settings (as well as levels\nof utilitarian and informational reinforcement) have employed Mehrabian and\nRussell\u2019s (1974) pleasure, arousal and dominance (PAD) scales. The dominance\nCONSUMER BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS AND SOCIAL MARKETING\n111\n(dominance-submissiveness) dimension ranges from extreme feelings of lack of\ncontrol or influence upon one\u2019s surroundings to feelings of being influential and\npowerful, or in control. Empirical studies have shown the significantly high\npower of the dominance dimension in discriminating between open\/closed\nconsumer behavior settings (Foxall & Greenley, 1998, 1999, 2000; Foxall &\nYani-de-Soriano, 2005; Soriano, Foxall & Pearson, 2002).\n In addition, the notion that in a relatively open consumer behavior setting,\nthe individual is relatively free to determine his own choices finds support in\nrecent consumer research. In their study of control and empowerment, Wathieu et\nal. (2002) challenged the traditional economic view which assumes that \u201ca larger\nchoice set would constitute an improvement of a consumer\u2019s situation\u201d and their\nfindings showed that certain kinds of choice set expansions may cause aversive\nbehavior in consumers, which is explained by self-control, regret and overload\nmechanisms.  Finally, in a relatively open consumer behavior setting the\nconsumer feels more autonomous and his subjective perception of control has a\npositive impact on his long-term well-being (Langer and Rodin, 1976; Langer,\n1983).\nA BEHAVIORAL CLASSIFICATION OF CONSUMER CHOICE\nWorking with the proposed bifurcation of utilitarian and informational\nreinforcement already described, the BPM suggests that four operant classes of\nconsumer behavior can be described according to the pattern of reinforcement\n(i.e., high\/low utilitarian and high\/low informational) which maintains it. These\nare shown in Table 1. Behaviors classed as accomplishment are maintained by\nhigh levels of both utilitarian and informational reinforcement and may include\nconspicuous consumption behaviors such as buying status cars.\nBehaviors classed as hedonism are characterized by high levels of utilitarian\nreinforcement and are usually reinforced by entertainment\u2014for example,\nwatching popular TV programs might be placed in this category. Behaviors\nreinforced negatively by the removal of a utilitarian aversive stimulus, such as\ntaking an aspirin for a headache may be included here.\nBehaviors classed as accumulat ion  are principally reinforced by\ninformational reinforcement and may include collecting trading stamps or points\nin a loyalty program (for a supermarket) or being involved in a token economy\n(where the environment is more closed).\nBehaviors classed as maintenance are routine behaviors necessary to sustain\none\u2019s physiological being (eating, sleeping) and to function as a member of a\nsocial group, or a citizen in society (paying taxes for inescapable consumption or\ngetting a passport). In maintenance, levels of utilitarian and informational rein-\nFOXALL, OLIVEIRA-CASTRO ET AL.\n112\nTABLE 1. OPERANT CLASSES BASED ON THE LEVELS OF UTILITARIAN AND\nINFORMATIONAL REINFORCEMENT.\nHigh Utilitarian\nReinforcement\nLow Utilitarian\nReinforcement\nHigh Informational\nReinforcement\nACCOMPLISHMENT ACCUMULATION\nLow Informational\nReinforcement\nHEDONISM MAINTENANCE\nforcement are substantially lower than for the other classes of behavior, but are far\nfrom unimportant and may be controlled negatively by the removal of a threat. A\nmore detailed discussion and interpretation of the four operant classes can be\nfound in Foxall (1990, 1993, 1994).\nThese operant classes can be operationalized alongside the scope of the\nsetting to produce eight separate contingency categories to analyze a broad range\nof behaviors. These categories are summarized in Table 2.\nBEHAVIOR ANALYTIC RELEVANCE TO ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION\nSo far this paper has presented a behavioral analytic approach to complex\nbehavior and how this has been utilized in consumer choice situations. A\nbifurcation of reinforcement has been described, taking into account the more\ncomplex nature of human reinforcement; and this approach has been applied to\ncurrent behavioral research in consumer choice environments. The importance of\nthe scope of the behavior setting has also been explored.\nEnvironmental problems and detrimental consumer choices resulting from\npatterns of consumerism, encouraged by mass advertising, such as atmospheric\npollution, waste disposal and resource depletion have multiple causes and require\ncomposite responses (van Raaij, 1988). Because of this, solutions lie beyond the\nscope of any single discipline. Modern marketing thought fully supports the\nCONSUMER BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS AND SOCIAL MARKETING\n113\nTABLE 2.

When marketing is directly responsible for abuses of the environment,\nsocial marketing or de-marketing may provide ways of reversing their effects.\nHowever any marketing\/de-marketing strategy undertaken to affect environmental\nbehavior must link with both the micro level aspects of consumer choice and the\nactivities of marketing firms with the macro level of public policy and regulation.\nSocial marketing issues in isolation are unlikely to provide the required\nintegrative framework for understanding the ways in which consumer behavior\nimpacts deleteriously on the environment and for suggesting remedial action. This\nis firstly because commercial marketing is generally a short-term activity unlike\nenvironmental problems which have a long-term duration and effect. Largely\nthere has been an over reliance on textbook marketing principles which have in\nthe main been developed with fast moving consumer goods and are therefore not\nappropriate in this context. For example the behavior change needed to buy a\ndifferent brand of soap is not huge whereas the modification of environment-\nimpacting consumer behavior imposes major costs and must overcome\nconsiderable obstacles to change.\nSocial-marketing programs have also been critiqued on the grounds they do\nnot generally use the fully integrated marketing mix but rely to a disproportionate\nextent on social advertising. Secondly, there has been an over reliance on\ncognitive theoretical perspectives, which have generally failed because of a lack\nof attitudinal-behavioral consistency. For example, although consumers know in\ndetail about the ecologically deleterious effect of much of modern consumption\nand are generally relatively knowledgeable, they do not, on the whole, bring this\nbehavior in line with the more rational patterns advocated by conservationists\n(Constanzo, Archer, Aronson, & Pettigrew, 1986). Lehman and Geller (2004)\nnote that although there has been continued interest in the behavior basis of\nenvironmental conservation, the peak of this type of research was in the 1970s,\nwhen the first Earth Day served as an activator. Consequently environmental\nattitudes research at this time flourished. The behavior analytical models\ndiscussed above are likely to provide a better basis from which environmental\nbehavior can be promoted and maintained.\n                                                           \n6 Jobber (2004, 912) defines the marketing mix as \u201ca framework for the tactical management of\nthe customer relationship, including product [attributes, packaging etc], place [distribution, for\nexample through retail stores or the internet], price and promotion [advertising, public relations\netc] (the 4-Ps)\u201d. He also suggests that in the case of service marketing three other elements should\nbe included: process, people and physical evidence.\nCONSUMER BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS AND SOCIAL MARKETING\n115\nAPPLIED BEHAVIOR RESEARCH AND ENVIRONMENTAL BEHAVIOR\nA behavior analytic approach would suggest that demand for products or\nservices which have adverse effects on the physical environment is controlled by\nthe consequences of consumer behavior. Previous reinforcing consequences will\nmake the behavior more likely to be repeated and similar behavior will be more\nprobable now and in the future. Punishers reduce the frequency of the behavior\nthat produced them. Antecedent factors also affect the rate at which behavior\noccurs, for they signal the reinforcing (or punishing) consequences likely to\nfollow the performance of a particular act. At its simplest, a consumer behavior\ncan be stated as A:B:C, where A=Antecedents, B=Behavior and\nC=Consequences. The colons imply that the variables are related probabilistically;\nthe existence of an antecedent does not automatically lead to the specified\nbehavior; nor does the reward of that behavior on previous occasions make its\nrepetition inevitable now (Blackman, 1980).\nHowever, as mentioned previously, consumer behavior is frequently more\ncomplicated than this as it is simultaneously reinforced and punished. For\nexample, buying a brand can be reinforced by gaining the attributes of the product\nand by consumption, but punished by the surrender of money. The loss of which\ndeprives the buyer of other opportunities (Alhadeff, 1982). In environment-\nimpacting behavior, the reinforcers of purchase are usually immediate and private\nwhile the punishments are delayed and public. The unrestricted acquisition of\nshort-term reinforcers by a limited number of individuals can result in substantial\nlong-term aversive consequences for all users. Hardin (1968) suggests that, in the\nshort term, positive components of the situation will outweigh the negative\ncomponents for each individual, leading to each of us damaging the environment.\nIn the long term, the build up of each individual\u2019s actions will result in\ndevastating environmental damage that affects the whole population.\nPrevious applied behavior research in environmental behavior has\nconcentrated on and incorporated three broad types of antecedent and consequent\nstimuli. Antecedents have consisted of prompts, such as warnings, reasoned\nargument and facts, threats, relating to the deleterious effects of actions that\nexploit or pollute the environment which are an attractive intervention due to their\nlow cost (Lehman & Geller, 2004). These antecedents are designed to act as\ndiscriminative stimuli, signaling the aversive consequences of specific behaviors\nthat impact on the environment for all.\nConsequential stimuli have consisted of feedback, such as specific\/personal\ninformation on the actual effects of individuals\u2019 actions (e.g. levels of reduction of\nhis\/her electricity consumption or private car mileage), and incentives, such as\nFOXALL, OLIVEIRA-CASTRO ET AL.\n116\nfinancial bonuses, praise and encouragement (e.g., reward with additional\nconsumption goods or the capacity to acquire them for pro-social behaviors).\nGenerally strong links have been found between conservation behavior and\nits consequences, and incentives have commonly the strongest immediate\ninfluence on the behavior, at least in the short term. Incentives used alone have\nmore effect than feedback used alone. Feedback in the form of education and\ninformation is expected to be more successful as a strategy when it is tailored to\nfit a specific situation (Lehman & Geller 2004). In turn, feedback has a more far\nreaching effect than does prompting (antecedents). Also it has been found that\nprompts have an extremely limited effect if incentives are not presented closely\ntied in to the performance of specific conservation behaviors.\nSome of the most effective interventions involve the use of incentives and\nfeedback in combination, supported where feasible by prompts that use rules to\nlink definite conservation responses to the rewards they will produce for the\nindividual consumer. For reviews of applied behavior research on consumers\u2019\nconservation choices and behavior see Cone and Hayes (1980), Dwyer, Leeming,\nCobern, Porter, and Jackson (1996), and Everett and Watson (1987).\nIn summary, previous applied behavior analyses have revealed and supported\ntwo types of consequences: incentives and performance feedback. These two\ntypes align well with the two forms of reinforcement discussed earlier: Utilitarian\nand Informational Reinforcement. Both utilitarian reinforcement and incentives\nare based around more tangible reinforcers and are personal in nature, in the sense\nof not depending on other persons. Some authors have argued their capacity to\nreinforce behavior lies in the feelings of pleasure, fun, fantasy, amusement,\narousal, sensory gratification, imaginative, appreciation and enjoyment which\nthey engender directly or indirectly in their recipients (Hirschman & Holbrook,\n1982; Holbrook & Hirschman, 1982). Although these terms would not be used in\na typical behavior-analytic interpretation, they seem to stress that utilitarian\nreinforcers are mediated by the product or service itself. That is, they depend\nupon the relation between the consumer and the product or service rather than on\nthe behavior of other persons. Both incentives and utilitarian reinforcement are, in\nthis sense, intrinsically motivating, personal and private.\nPerformance feedback and informational reinforcement also align well. These\nnon-utilitarian reinforcers function informationally as feedback on the quality and\nquantity of reinforcement; and in the case of consumer behavior, informational\nreinforcement may consist of recognition of one\u2019s progress as a consumer and\nreflect in the acquisition of symbols of social and economic achievement. Both\nfeedback and informational reinforcement are a measure of how well the person is\ndoing and are largely extrinsic. It is generally expected that environmental\nCONSUMER BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS AND SOCIAL MARKETING\n117\nconservation behavior would be influenced primarily by informational\nconsequences (\u201cdoing the right thing,\u201d \u201cbeing ecologically correct\u201d) without clear\nutilitarian gain for consumers and, what makes things worse, they usually involve\nsome utilitarian loss for them. For example, products that are ecologically correct\n(e.g., organic products) are usually more expensive (at least for supermarket\nproducts or fast moving consumer goods) than traditional products resulting in\nmore financial losses. Considering the results discussed earlier which suggest\nconsumers\u2019 choices for supermarket products are influenced by price, utilitarian\nreinforcers and informational reinforcers in that order, it is not surprising that\ninformational consequences alone do not always have a substantial effect on\npreservation behavior.\nFoxall (1994) suggests informational reinforcers may derive their power\nultimately from their association with the utilitarian consequences of behavior,\nwhich may account for the successful synergistic effect of incentives and\nfeedback in combination. Moreover, the symbolic, verbal reinforcers in\ninformational feedback are related to the tendency for human behavior to be rule-\ngoverned as well as shaped by direct consequences (Hayes, 1989; Skinner, 1969).\nThis would account for the ability of specific prompts, acting as instructions for\npro-social behavior, to increase the motivational effect of utilitarian\/incentives\nand informational\/feedback consequences.\nREFINING THE PROBLEM\nEach operant class of behavior within the BPM framework has so far been\ndescribed positively, but each does have a down side. Especially in affluent,\nmarketing-oriented societies, consumers seek ever-greater accomplishments based\non both intrinsic utilitarian benefits and extrinsic proof of their social status often\nresulting in the consumption of scarce and irreplaceable resources. For example,\nprivate-car ownership and use results in depletion of fuel and damage to the\nenvironment. Pleasure seeking (hedonism) may affect the environment through\nindulgent energy consumption, and accumulation brings with it the need to\ndispose of packaging and surplus materials. Finally, maintenance, consumption of\nthe basic commodities themselves such as water and fossil fuels, now threatens\nfurther consumption by depleting stocks. These behaviors and their typical\nreinforcers and aversive environmental consequences are summarized in Table 3.\nIn developing strategies and de-marketing to reduce the negative outputs of\nthese behaviors, marketers must first have an understanding of how the current\nbehavior is maintained by a combination of utilitarian and informational\nconsequences (the pattern of reinforcement outlined in Table 4), and how this\naffects consumers\u2019 behaviors. Secondly, marketing-mix strategies need to provide\nFOXALL, OLIVEIRA-CASTRO ET AL.\n118\nTABLE 3.

For example, if\nspecific classes of consumer behavior are maintained by defined patterns of high\nversus low utilitarian and informational reinforcement, intervention should be\nexpected to succeed when it maintains current levels of reinforcement or increases\nthe level of one source of reinforcement without reducing that of the other.\nSpecific demarketing strategies and marketing-mix strategies can be\ndeveloped for each of the classes of operant behavior, each using one example of\na type of problem environmental behavior. These are summarized in Table 4 and\nare now discussed further.\nAccomplishment: A Problem of Private Transport\nApplied behavior analysts have often been concerned with the\nenvironmentally-impacting behavior of the use of private transportation.

With this knowledge, a\nnumber of demarketing strategies can be developed. With both high levels of\nutilitarian and informational reinforcement, any demarketing strategy should\nattempt to replace or maintain these.\nEffective competition to driving must be made available, for example, by\nmaking buses and other forms of public transportation more popular, comfortable,\nsocially acceptable and quicker, if possible. General prompts are unlikely to work\nalone but rules which link specific behaviors and their outcomes may be effective.\nFOXALL, OLIVEIRA-CASTRO ET AL.\n120\nSuch rules should stress the reinforcers for bus riders in terms of the personal\ngratification this provides rather than vague predictions of a remote better\nenvironment for all. Any attempt at punishing motorists through taxes and tolls is\nlikely to be counterproductive, since the high levels of both utilitarian and\ninformational reinforcement available from driving will compensate for attempts\nat punishment.\nAn appropriate marketing-mix strategy would concentrate on the product\navailable and the strengthening of the utilitarian and informational reinforcement\navailable from it. It may be the case that a brand new product is a necessity to\nfulfill this. The price of a new product would be important as car purchases are\noften driven by conspicuous consumption. Once a new product is established, the\nprice of the old product could be increased to punish its usage. Until this point is\nreached however, such a price rise would have little overall effect on demand for\nthe product, given the abundant utilitarian and informational reinforcers.\nPrompts in the form of promotion are unlikely to have a large effect, although\nif coupled with effective consequential stimuli, they may provide a necessary\ninformative and persuasive role. The factor of place could be used by opening the\nbehavior settings and making it more open to competition and making any new\nproduct widely and easily available.\nProducts are already being developed which may help the problem. Hybrid\ntechnology cars are now available which do not harm the environment as much as\ncars with traditional engines. These cars provide the normal utilitarian benefits,\nsuch as the fun of driving and control of ones journey, but this may be reduced\nslightly due to the often higher initial cost of these vehicles. Informational\nreinforcement would also be about the same. However, as these types of vehicles\ndo still cause damage to the environment, albeit to a much lesser extent, they are\nby no means a final solution.\nHedonism: A Problem of Domestic Energy Consumption\nThe use of domestic energy is based on consequences which include\nconvenience and comfort, and so are generally maintained by high levels of\nutilitarian reinforcement. While informational reinforcement (or feedback) is less\nobvious, it may be important in social situations where visitors are also affected\nby usage. In previous research, both incentives and feedback have been used\nalone and in combination to reduce domestic energy consumption with an\nindication that incentives have the largest effect (cf. Hayes & Cone, 1977; Winett,\nNeal & Grier, 1979).\nPunishment, as in the case of accomplishment, for example by raising prices,\nis unlikely to work because the high utilitarian reinforcement will compensate for\nCONSUMER BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS AND SOCIAL MARKETING\n121\nthe rise in price. Any strategy needs to maintain the high levels of utilitarian\nreinforcement. It has been suggested, and supported through success in some\nstudies, that any social demarketing in this area should concentrate on making the\nbehavior more involving by helping people avoid high bills and encounter self-\ngratification behavior at saving energy and reducing pollution.\nIn terms of a marketing-mix strategy, the principal element would be\npromotion entailing effective and informative communication with the consumer.\nThe required modification of consumer behavior is most likely to be achieved\nthrough the provision of increased, relatively rapid and regular information on\nconsumption. This should be included as part of the product provided by the\nenergy companies. In terms of place, consumers should be encouraged to make\npersonal and domestic arrangements which promote thermal savings (e.g. better\ninsulation and the elimination of useless energy consumption such as the\nillumination of unused rooms).\nAccumulation: A Problem of Waste Disposal\nWaste disposal is classed as accumulation but the problem is actually\nmanifested in the opposite of accumulation: disposal. Indiscriminate waste\ndisposal has relatively few utilitarian reinforcers other than convenience, but its\ninformational outcomes are extensive if subtle. It confers status through the\nassumption that someone else will clear up, and it may also imply conspicuous\nconsumption. Intervention may take the form of increasing informational\nreinforcement by linking the individual\u2019s attempts at recycling or saving resources\nand feeding this information back to them.\nShowing the pro-social consequences of conformity has also been put\nforward as a possible intervention as it increases the personal element. The most\nappropriate marketing-mix strategy would concentrate on place. This is because\nlitter itself is a discriminative stimulus for further littering (Tuso, Witmer &\nGeller, 1975) and the provision of bags, bins and other containers that encourage\ncorrect disposal is likely to have a cumulative effect on behavior. Prompts in the\nform of promotion can be used to show what to put, where to put and when to put\nof disposal (Geller, 1973). Utilitarian reinforcers can be maintained by making\ndisposal methods convenient, and punishment can be reduced through financial\nrecompense or lower costs for returning bottles or other recyclable materials.\nMaintenance: A Problem of Domestic Water Consumption\nIn the case of domestic water consumption (classed as maintenance) both\nutilitarian and informational reinforcers are low, compared to the other class of\nFOXALL, OLIVEIRA-CASTRO ET AL.\n122\nconsumer behavior but are not absent. They are related to the consumer\u2019s state of\ndeprivation, as domestic water consumption allows us to drink, clean and wash\nwhich are basic human needs. Due to the low levels of both reinforcers it may be\nthe case that the most successful intervention strategy might be punishment. The\nutilitarian and informational positive consequences are not strongly motivational,\nso an increase in price would be particularly effective.\nA strategy affecting informational consequences in terms of feedback may\nalso be effective. For example, water metering technology could be installed\nproviding regular feedback on consumption. In line with these two interventions,\nprice would be the most effective marketing-mix element, especially as water is\nrelatively inelastic. This should however be used alongside recommendations of\nwater conservation methods such as smaller cisterns, use of rainwater and less\npurified water.\nCONCLUSION\nIn order to develop efficient strategies of environmental conservation, we\nneed to identify the variables that influence consumer behaviors that produce\nunwanted environmental impact. Within an operant framework this implies,\namong other things, examining the consequences that maintain such behaviors.\nOnly after identifying what events are reinforcing and punishing for individuals\nunder given conditions, can one, based on an operant framework, make specific\npredictions and plan well-grounded interventions concerning the behavior of\nindividuals. The distinction between informational and utilitarian consequences\nproposed by the BPM is a step in the direction of identifying what functions as\nreinforcers and punishers for consumers in general. This distinction has been\nuseful in analyzing consumers\u2019 brand choice and verbal responses to different\nconsumer settings.\nThe present paper applied such distinctions to analyses of some relevant\nclasses of behavior related to environmental conservation, namely, use of private\ntransportation, consumption of domestic energy, waste disposal, and domestic\nconsumption of water. Each of these operant classes appears to be maintained by\ndifferent levels of informational and utilitarian consequences, which suggests\nintervention plans should adopt differentiated and specific marketing strategies to\nmodify each behavior class.\nREFERENCES\nAlhadeff, D.
