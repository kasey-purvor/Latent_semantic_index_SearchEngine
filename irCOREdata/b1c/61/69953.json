INTRODUCTION\nTwo-dimensional dielectric microresonators attract\nconsiderable attention because of their prospective appli-\ncation as microlasers and single-photon cavities, as well\nas sensors in chemical and biological systems [1\u20136]. These\nsystems also allow the study of generic properties of par-\ntially confined waves in a clean setting, and hence provide\na route to acquire knowledge which can be transferred,\ne.g., to mesoscopic electronic devices [7]. The analogy\nis most complete when comparing non-interacting elec-\ntrons in cooled, patterned two-dimensional semiconduc-\ntor devices (which usually leak through quantum-point\ncontacts) with passive optical (or micro-wave) resonators\nequipped with small openings. For such geometries,\nsemiclassical methods and random-matrix theory have\nprovided a deep theoretical understanding of the spec-\ntral and transport properties, which have been found to\nagree with numerous experiments and numerical compu-\ntations [8\u201313]. In particular, it is now well established\nthat the predictions of random-matrix theory, designed\nfor wave-chaotic systems with strong mode-mixing, are\nof universal applicability when the width of the open-\nings W is much less than the linear system size L, im-\nplying a long mean lifetime in the system. For two-\ndimensional ballistic geometries, this requirement can be\nquantified by comparing the numbersN \u221dWk of outcou-\npled channels at wavenumber k to the number of chan-\nnels M \u221d Lk which are mixed by the scattering at the\nboundaries. Standard random-matrix universality then\nrequires M \u00c0 N .\nDielectric microresonators, however, leak everywhere\naround the interface and are far more open than the res-\nonators considered in standard random-matrix theory.\nThe photonic confinement relies on internal reflection,\nwhich only becomes perfect for angles of incidence above\na critical value. As a consequence, the effective \u2018open-\nness\u2019 increases with the system size, resulting in N \u221dM .\nUniversality is no longer guaranteed, and a more detailed\nmodelling is required. This modelling also has to account\nfor the possible presence of an active medium, essential\nfor microlasers, which have been manufactured in many\nforms and materials [4, 14\u201327].\nIn this paper we develop a quantum-dynamical descrip-\ntion of two-dimensional dielectric microresonators which\ncombines wave-chaotic propagation of photons inside the\nresonator with the Fresnel laws for reflection and refrac-\ntion at the interface. The general construction is based on\na variant of the quantum surface-of-section method [28\u2013\n33]. The propagation inside the resonator is expressed\nin terms of an internal scattering matrix, which we spec-\nify by either using random-matrix theory [10, 34] or a\nquantum-dynamical paradigm of chaotic wave propaga-\ntion, the quantum kicked rotator [35]. Similar models\nhave recently been developed for mesoscopic electronic\nand hybrid-superconducting devices [36\u201340], which re-\nquire different boundary conditions to open up the sys-\ntem and do not allow for amplification.\nThe random-matrix and quantum kicked rotator vari-\nants of the model are explored to investigate the thresh-\nold and the quantum-limited line width of wave-chaotic\ndielectric microlasers. The laser threshold is related to\nthe decay rate \u0393 of the longest living resonances, and\ncan be read off from the imaginary part of the frequency\n(which is complex for the non-hermitian operator describ-\ning an open system). For a good, conventional laser res-\nonator (with almost-perfect mirrors), the line width (full\nwidth at half maximum of the Lorentzian line shape) is\ngiven by the Shawlow-Townes formula [41]\n\u2206\u03c9ST =\n1\n2\n\u03932\nI\n, (1)\nwhere I is the total output intensity. In an open res-\nonator, the line width is enhanced with respect to this\n2prediction by the so-called Petermann factor K,\n\u2206\u03c9 = K\u2206\u03c9ST , (2)\nwhich can be related to the mutual non-orthogonality of\nthe resonance modes obtained from the non-hermitian\noperator [42\u201347], and has been studied extensively in a\nwide range of quantum-optical frameworks [48\u201359]. We\ninvestigate how \u0393 and K depend on the refractive index\nn and the size of the resonator (quantified by N andM),\nand also discriminate between the two possible polariza-\ntions TE and TM (where the electric or magnetic field\nlies inside the resonator plane, respectively). The results\nare contrasted with predictions of random-matrix theory\nfor resonators with small openings [12, 44\u201346, 60, 61].\nWe start this paper in Section II with a brief summary\nof the basic concepts involved in the description of two-\ndimensional dielectric microresonators. The quantum-\ndynamical models are formulated in Section III. In Sec-\ntion IV we present the statistics of decay rates \u0393 (de-\ntermining the laser threshold) and Petermann factors K\n(determining the line width). These results are obtained\nby numerical sampling of the random-matrix ensemble\nand the parameter space of the quantum-kicked rotator.\nA summary of the results and conclusions is presented in\nSection V.\nII. TWO-DIMENSIONAL DIELECTRIC\nRESONATORS\nWe consider planar dielectric microresonators of a\nsmall width \u2206z whose material properties are character-\nized by a refractive index n(\u03c9), which may depend on the\nangular frequency \u03c9. Amplification is modelled within an\neffective medium approach, so that the refractive index\nis complex, with \u2212 Imn > 0 proportional to the ampli-\nfication rate. The refractive index is taken as homoge-\nneous within the resonator and unity in the surrounding\nmedium. The geometry of the resonator is specified by a\nregion D in the (x, y) plane.\nWe assume that only the lowest-lying transverse mode\nis excited, which provides the best confinement at the\nplanar interfaces and hence results in the longest-living\nresonances. For small wavelengths (\u03bb = c\/\u03c9 \u00bf L,\nwhere c is the velocity of light and L is the linear dimen-\nsion of the resonator in the plane), the radiation outside\nthe resonator is mostly confined to the resonator plane.\nThroughout this plane, the electromagnetic field can then\nbe described by a scalar wavefunction \u03c8(r), r = (x, y),\nwhich represents the electric or magnetic field component\nparallel to the z axis (TM or TE polarization, respec-\ntively).\nThe wavefunction \u03c8(x, y) obeys the Helmholtz equa-\ntion\n[c2\u22072 + n2(r)\u03c92]\u03c8(r) = 0. (3)\nAt the interfaces the wavefunction \u03c8 and its normal\nderivative \u2202\u22a5\u03c8 are continuous for TM polarization, while\nfor TE polarization these continuity requirements are ful-\nfilled by \u03c8 and n\u22122\u2202\u22a5\u03c8.\nFor interfaces with no curvature, these boundary con-\nditions result in Snell\u2019s law\nsin \u03b7 = n sin\u03c7, (4)\nwhich relates the angle of incidence \u03b7 from a wave ap-\nproaching the interface to the angle of refraction \u03c7 of the\nwave within the refractive medium. The reflection prob-\nabilities for both polarizations are given by the Fresnel\nlaws [62, 63]\nRTM =\nsin2(\u03c7\u2212 \u03b7)\nsin2(\u03c7+ \u03b7)\n, RTE =\ntan2(\u03c7\u2212 \u03b7)\ntan2(\u03c7+ \u03b7)\n. (5)\nFrom within the medium, total reflection occurs for an-\ngles of incidence \u03c7 > \u03c7c larger than the critical angle,\nwhich is determined by the condition sin\u03c7c = 1\/n.\nFor the more complicated interface geometry of a mi-\ncroresonator, the radiative properties are encoded in the\nscattering matrix S(\u03c9), which relates the incoming and\noutgoing amplitudes \u03c8(out)i =\n\u2211\nj Sij\u03c8\n(in)\nj in a suitably\nchosen, flux-normalized basis of scattering states. The\npoles of the scattering matrix are defined by the condi-\ntion S(\u03c9m) = \u221e. For \u03c9 = \u03c9m, the Helmholtz equation\n(3) permits solutions \u03c8m(r) with purely outgoing bound-\nary conditions, \u03c8(in)j = 0. For a real refractive index,\nthese poles lie in the lower part of the complex plane\nIm\u03c9m \u2261 \u2212\u0393m\/2 < 0, where \u0393m is the cold-cavity decay\nrate of the mode. Amplification shifts the poles towards\nthe real axis. Within this effective-medium approach, the\nlaser threshold is reached when the first pole crosses the\nreal axis, so that the purely outgoing wave field of the\nlaser can be realized at physical, real frequencies \u03c9 = \u03c9m\n[64, 65].\nThe active medium within the resonator emits radia-\ntion due to the spontaneous emission of photons and their\nsubsequent amplification. Assuming total population in-\nversion of the active transition within the medium, the\nfrequency-resolved output intensity is given by [66, 67]\nI(\u03c9) =\n1\n2pi\ntr [S\u2020(\u03c9)S(\u03c9)\u2212 1]. (6)\nThis expression vanishes for a passive medium (with a\nreal refractive index), for which the scattering matrix is\nunitary.\nClose to the laser threshold, the radiation is dominated\nby a Lorentzian peak around \u03c9 = Re\u03c9m. The width\nof the peak can be associated to the spontaneous emis-\nsion processes, which perturb the amplitude and phase\nof the emitted radiation. The Shawlow-Townes formula\n(1) arises when the resonance in the intensity (6) is cal-\nculated within Breit-Wigner perturbation theory, which\nis based on the mutually orthogonal modes of the closed\nresonator. Equation (2) including the Petermann factor\naccounts for the non-orthogonality of the modes in the\nopen resonator. For \u03c9L \u00c0 c, the Petermann factor can\n3be expressed in terms of the resonance wave function as\n[43, 68],\nKm =\n\u2223\u2223\u222b\nD\ndr |\u03c8m(r)|2\n\u2223\u22232\u2223\u2223\u222b\nD\ndr\u03c8m(r)2\n\u2223\u22232 . (7)\nAbove the laser threshold, the resonator becomes un-\nstable, since the gain in the medium outweighs the losses\nthrough the interfaces. The steady-state intensity is lim-\nited by pumping and saturation of the medium, which\nrequires study of the non-linear regime as done, e.g., in\nRefs. [51, 56, 69]. The feedback with the medium stabi-\nlizes the amplitude of the laser, but not the phase, whose\ndynamics gives rise to a finite laser line width. The result-\ning width is half the width obtained from the cold-cavity\ncalculation, which also includes the amplitude fluctua-\ntions [48]. Equations (1) and (2) include this reduction\nfactor of one-half.\nIII. QUANTUM-DYNAMICAL MODEL\nA. Construction\nIn order to set up the quantum-dynamical model of a\ndielectric microresonator we separate the motion within\nthe cavity, which is assumed to be wave-chaotic, from\nthe reflection and refraction processes at the resonator\ninterfaces, which is assumed to be governed by the Snell\nand Fresnel laws (4) and (5), respectively.\nThe construction follows a variant of the quantum\nsurface-of-section method [28\u201332] which we adapt to the\nspecifics of wave propagation in a microresonator, and\nbares similarities to the methods used in an efficient nu-\nmerical scheme for specific cavities [33]. For motiva-\ntion let us first consider the classical ray dynamics in\nthe system. The successive internal reflections of these\nrays at the interfaces are conveniently represented in\nterms of Birkhoff\u2019s canonical coordinates, given by the\nlength along the boundary, q, and the sine of the an-\ngle of incidence, p = sin\u03c7. The internal ray dynamics\nis then reduced to a sequence of points (qn, pn), which\nare generated by an area-preserving mapM : (qn, pn)\u2192\n(qn+1, pn+1). At each encounter with the interface, a\nray is split into a refracted part, which escapes to the\nexterior, and a reflected part which remains inside the\nresonator. The relative amount of reflection is measured\nby the reflection coefficients (5), which in Birkhoff coor-\ndinates are written\nRTM (p) =\n(\u221a\n1\u2212 p2 \u2212\n\u221a\nn\u22122 \u2212 p2\u221a\n1\u2212 p2 +\n\u221a\nn\u22122 \u2212 p2\n)2\n, (8a)\nRTE(p) =\n(\u221a\n1\u2212 p2 \u2212 n\n\u221a\n1\u2212 n2p2\u221a\n1\u2212 p2 + n\n\u221a\n1\u2212 n2p2\n)2\n(8b)\nfor |p| < 1\/n, while R = 1 for |p| > 1\/n.\nIn wave optics, a similar separation of the internal dy-\nnamics and the encounters with the interface can be car-\nried out for kL \u00c0 1. In this limit, the internal wave\nfunction \u03c8(int) = \u03c8(int,in) + \u03c8(int,out) can be separated\ninto the component \u03c8(int,in) which propagates away from\nthe interfaces, towards the interior of the resonator, and\nthe component \u03c8(int,out) which propagates towards the\ninterfaces. Because the separation relies on the propaga-\ntion direction it is best carried out in momentum space,\ncorresponding to states with a well defined canonical co-\nordinate p. The geometry of the collision with the inter-\nface is encoded in the internal scattering matrix F (\u03c9),\nwhich relates the components of the internal wave func-\ntion,\n\u03c8(int,out) = F (\u03c9)\u03c8(int,in). (9)\nThis is equivalent to Bogomolny\u2019s transfer operator [29],\noriginally introduced for closed systems. The matrix\nF (\u03c9) is unitary and symmetric, the latter property\narising from the time-reversal symmetry in a dielectric\nmedium. The dimension M \u223c Int[Cn\u03c9\/pic] of F (\u03c9) de-\npends on the perimeter C of the interface, which is pro-\nportional to the system size, C \u221d L.\nIn the classical limit \u03c9L\/c \u221d M \u2192 \u221e, F (\u03c9) corre-\nsponds to the mapM. When \u03c9L\/c\u00c0 1, the momentum\np is quasi-continuous,\npl \u223c 2l \u2212M \u2212 12M , l = 1, . . . ,M. (10)\nAt the interfaces the internal wave function is cou-\npled to the external wave field, which can be decomposed\nin the conventional scattering states \u03c8(ext) = \u03c8(ext,in) +\n\u03c8(ext,out). The coupling is of the general form\n\u03c8(int,in) = R\u03c8(int,out) + T \u03c8(ext,in), (11a)\n\u03c8(ext,out) = \u2212R\u03c8(ext,in) + T \u03c8(int,out), (11b)\nwhereR is the reflection matrix and T is the transmission\nmatrix, constrained by R\u2020R+T \u2020T = 1. The linear Eqs.\n(9) and (11) can be solved to arrive at the scattering\nmatrix\nS(\u03c9) = \u2212R+ T F (\u03c9) 1\n1\u2212RF (\u03c9)T . (12)\nThis general form of the scattering matrix has also been\nencountered in recent investigations of electronic trans-\nport and superconducting hybrid structures with small\nballistic openings [36\u201340].\nOur construction of the quantum-dynamical model is\ncompleted by concrete specifications of the matrices R\nand F (\u03c9). For kL \u00c0 1, Snell\u2019s law dictates that the\nmatrices R and T in Eq. (11) become diagonal between\nstates which conserve np, while the Fresnel laws (8) de-\nliver the values of the diagonal elements,\nRlm = \u03b4lm\n\u221a\nR(pl), Tlm = \u03b4lm\n\u221a\n1\u2212R(pl), (13)\nwith pl given by Eq. (10).\n4Concerning the internal dynamics encoded in F (\u03c9),\nwe now follow two routes \u2014 we either employ random-\nmatrix theory or a generic wave-chaotic quantum map,\nthe quantum kicked rotator.\n1. Random-matrix model\nIt is commonly accepted that statistical properties of\nwave systems with chaotic ray dynamics are well de-\nscribed by random-matrix theory. In the present case of a\ndielectric system, which preserves time-reversal symme-\ntry, this approach amounts to assuming that F at fixed,\nreal \u03c9 can be represented by a unitary symmetric matrix\nrandomly drawn from the Circular Orthogonal Ensemble\n(COE) [34]. This substitution should best capture the\nstatistical features of the longest-living resonances, since\nin a realistic resonator ray chaos is only established after\na few internal reflections.\nIn general, the frequency dependence of F (\u03c9) is com-\nplicated. In the subsequent analysis we will only require\nthe local dependence around the poles of the scattering\nmatrix, and employ as a simple approximation\nF (\u03c9) = exp(in\u03c9L\u00af\/c)U, U from COE(M), fixed, (14)\nwhere L\u00af is the mean propagation distance between two\nreflections. Sabine\u2019s law of room acoustics delivers the\nuniversal expression L\u00af = piA\/C, where A is the area of\nthe resonator and C is its perimeter. Our approxima-\ntion entails (2pi)\u22121 Im trF \u2020 dFd\u03c9 =MnL\u00af\/2cpi \u223c An\u03c9\/2pic.\nThis reproduces the correct expression for the mean den-\nsity of states, while a more elaborate modelling of the \u03c9\ndependence would also describe fluctuations around this\nvalue.\nThe random-matrix model of two-dimensional wave-\nchaotic microresonators is obtained by combining Eqs.\n(12), (13), and (14). In order to simplify the notation we\nintroduce the quasi-energy\n\u03b8 = n\u03c9L\u00af\/c. (15)\nThis delivers the scattering matrix\nS = \u2212R+ T U 1\nexp(\u2212i\u03b8)\u2212RU T , (16)\nwhere U is an M \u00d7M matrix from the COE, while the\ndiagonal matrix R is given in Eq. (13).\n2. Quantum kicked rotator model\nThe quantum kicked rotator [35] is a quantized version\nof the classical standard map on the torus (q, p) \u2208 [0, 1)2,\nwhich consists of a combination of torsions p\u2192 p+q and\nnonlinear \u2018kicks\u2019 q \u2192 q + f(p), where f(p) = f(p+ 1) =\n\u2212dv\/dp is periodic and can be represented as the deriva-\ntive of a potential v(p). In order to break all symmetries\napart from time-reversal symmetry we employ a quan-\ntum kicked rotator corresponding to a torsion followed\nby a kick with\nf(p) = K1 sin(2pip) +K2 sin(4pip+ \u03b1), (17)\nv(p) =\nK1\n2pi\ncos(2pip) +\nK2\n4pi\ncos(4pip+ \u03b1), (18)\nwhere the kicking strengths K1, K2 and the shift \u03b1 are\nfree parameters. The classical dynamics is known to be\nchaotic for K1, K2 & 8.\nThe propagator, or Floquet matrix, takes the form\nUnm =\n1\u221a\niM\ne\nipi\nM (m\u2212n)2\u2212 iM2 [v( nM )+v(mM )]. (19)\nThe quantum kicked rotator model of a wave-chaotic mi-\ncroresonator follows when this matrix is introduced into\nthe scattering matrix (16).\nB. Resonances and the Petermann factor\nWe now explore the general structure of the scatter-\ning matrix in the quantum-dynamical model and derive\ngeneral relations for the resonances and the Petermann\nfactor.\nThe scattering matrix (12) diverges when the resonant\ndenominator 1\u2212RF (\u03c9) has a vanishing eigenvalue. The\nmatrix RF (\u03c9) describes one round trip of a wave which\npropagates through the cavity, and then is internally re-\nflected at the interface. This quantization condition is\nanalogous to the scattering-matrix quantization condi-\ntion in a closed systems [70, 71], which is recovered for\nR = 1.\nFor the specific form (16) of the scattering matrix, the\nquantization condition takes the form\nRU\u03a8m = exp(\u2212i\u03b8m)\u03a8m, (20)\nwhich is of the form of an eigenvalue equation with eigen-\nvalue exp(\u2212i\u03b8m). The matrix RU can be interpreted as\na reduced round-trip operator. Since RU is subunitary,\nRU(RU)\u2020 = RR\u2020 < 1, all eigenvalues are submodular,\n| exp(\u2212i\u03b8m)| < 1; therefore the quasienergies \u03b8m have a\nnegative imaginary part, \u03b3m \u2261 \u22122 Im \u03b8m > 0.\nThe subunitarity of RU furthermore implies that the\nright eigenvectors \u03a8m defined by Eq. (20) are not mutu-\nally orthogonal. However, they form a bi-orthogonal set\nwith the left eigenvectors,\n\u3008\u03a6l|\u03a8m\u3009 = \u03b4lm, (21)\nwhere the latter are defined by the adjoint eigenvalue\nproblem\n\u03a6\u2020mRU = \u03a6\u2020m exp(\u2212i\u03b8m). (22)\nIn the original variables, the eigenphases \u03b8m can be\ninterpreted in two different ways: (1) They are poles\n5\u03b8m = n\u03c9mL\u00af\/c of the scattering matrix for fixed (possi-\nbly complex) refractive index n but variable, generally\ncomplex \u03c9m, (2) they deliver the threshold condition\n\u03b8m = nm\u03c9\u2032mL\u00af\/c of a given resonant state for real \u03c9\u2032m\nand a refractive index nm = n\u2032 + in\u2032\u2032m for which only the\nreal part is fixed. For the scattering matrix (16), both\nproblems are intimately related since only the product\nn\u03c9 enters the expressions. The cold-cavity poles \u03c9(cold)m\nare obtained for a real refractive index n = n\u2032. The\nthreshold amplification is then given by\nn\u2032\u2032m = n\n\u2032 Im\u03c9(cold)m \/Re\u03c9\n(cold)\nm . (23)\nFor realistic dielectric microresonators, this relation is\nindeed well established in the semiclassical limit L\u00c0 \u03bb =\nRe\u03c9\/c [72]. In such systems, it is moreover reasonable\nto assume that the width of the amplification window of\nthe active medium is much less than the center of this\nwindow, Re\u03c9m. Within the amplification window, the\nthreshold values n\u2032\u2032m then mainly depend on the imag-\ninary part Im\u03c9(cold)m \u2261 \u2212\u0393m\/2, where \u0393m is the cold-\ncavity decay rate. The laser threshold is hence deter-\nmined by the longest-living resonances of the cold cavity,\nwhich are characterized by a small value of \u0393m.\nWe now turn to the radiation emitted close to reso-\nnance, brought about by steering the amplification close\nto the threshold value (23), n\u2032\u2032 = n\u2032\u2032m+ \u03b4n, while keeping\n\u03c9 = Re\u03c9(cold)m + \u03b4\u03c9 real. We combine both deviations\ninto the quasienergy deviation \u03b8 \u2248 \u03b8m+ \u03b4\u03b8. The scatter-\ning matrix (16) can then be evaluated by only keeping\nthe resonant term in the denominator,\nS \u2248 T U\u03a8m e\ni\u03b8m\ne\u2212i\u03b4\u03b8 \u2212 1\u03a6\n\u2020\nmT (24)\nThe frequency-resolved output intensity Eq. (6) takes\nthe form\nI(\u03b8) \u2248 1\n2pic\nK\n4 sinh2( Im \u03b8m)\n| exp(iRe \u03b4\u03b8)\u2212 exp( Im \u03b4\u03b8)|2 , (25)\nwhere\nK = (\u03a8\u2020m\u03a8m)(\u03a6\n\u2020\nm\u03a6m). (26)\nWe now can linearize in \u03b4\u03b8, which produces the\nLorentzian lineshape\nI(\u03b8) \u2248 1\n2pi\nK\n4 sinh2( Im \u03b8m)\nRe \u03b4\u03b82 + Im \u03b4\u03b82\n. (27)\nSince we are mainly concerned with long living reso-\nnances in a large cavity, \u2212 Im\u03c9m = \u0393m\/2 \u00bf Re\u03c9, we\nfurther linearize the numerator and obtain in the fre-\nquency domain\nI(\u03c9) \u2248 1\n2pi\nK\n\u03932m\n(\u03c9 \u2212 Re\u03c9(cold)m )2 +\u2206\u03c92\/4\n, (28)\nwhere the full width at half maximum is \u2206\u03c9 =\n2\u03b4nRe\u03c9(cold)m \/n\u2032. The total intensity is given by\nI =\n\u222b\nd\u03c9I(\u03c9) = K\n\u03932m\n\u2206\u03c9\n. (29)\nThis recovers relation (2) [excluding the factor of 1\/2 due\nto the suppression of amplitude fluctuations by the non-\nlinear feedback in the lasing regime]. Consequently, K\ndefined in Eq. (26) has to be identified with the Peter-\nmann factor.\nExpression (26) assumes that the left and right eigen-\nvectors are normalized according to the bi-orthogonality\ncondition (21). When this condition is dropped, the Pe-\ntermann factor takes the more general form\nK =\n(\u03a8\u2020m\u03a8m)(\u03a6\n\u2020\nm\u03a6m)\n|\u03a6\u2020m\u03a8m|2\n. (30)\nIn the present, time-reversal-symmetric situation\nwhere U = UT , the right and left eigenvectors defined\nby Eqs. (20) and (22) can be chosen (via a suitable nor-\nmalization) such that \u03a6 = U\u2217\u03a8\u2217. This relation can be\nfurther exploited by decomposing U = V V T in terms\nof a unitary matrix V , which is fixed up to transforma-\ntions V \u2192 V O with an arbitrary orthogonal matrix O.\nThis decomposition allows us to pass to the symmetrized\neigenvalue problem\nV TRV \u03a8\u02dcm = exp(\u2212i\u03b8m)\u03a8\u02dcm, (31a)\n\u03a6\u02dc\u2020mV\nTRV = exp(\u2212i\u03b8m)\u03a6\u02dc\u2020m, (31b)\nwhich is solved by the right and left eigenvectors \u03a8\u02dc =\nV T\u03a8 and \u03a6\u02dc = V T\u03a6 = \u03a8\u02dc\u2217, respectively. In terms of\nthe symmetrized eigenvectors, the Petermann factor (30)\ntakes the form\nK =\n|\u03a8\u02dc\u2020m\u03a8\u02dcm|2\n|\u03a8\u02dcTm\u03a8\u02dcm|2\n. (32)\nThis expression is formally analogous to expression (7)\nfor the Petermann factor in terms of the resonance wave\nfunction inside the cavity, but involves the eigenvec-\ntors \u03a8\u02dcm of the symmetrized reduced round-trip operator\nV TRV . Furthermore, Eq. (32) is formally equivalent to\nthe expression used in earlier random-matrix theories for\ncavities with small openings [44\u201346, 61, 73\u201376].\nIV. NUMERICAL RESULTS\nWe now employ the quantum-dynamical model with\nscattering matrix (16) in order to investigate the statisti-\ncal properties of wave-chaotic dielectric microlasers. For\nfixed values of the refractive index n and polarization\n(TE or TM), the matrix U is either chosen as a ran-\ndom representative from the COE or as the quantum\nkicked rotator (19). The laser threshold follows from\nEq. (23), while the Petermann factor follows from Eq.\n6 0\n 0.2\n 0.4\n 0.6\n 0.8\n 1\n 0  2  4  6\nP(\n\u03b3)\n\u03b3\nTM\nTE\nn=1.5, RMT\n\u039c=200\n\u039c=100\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n 0  2  4  6\n \n\u03b3\nTM\nTE\nn=1.5, kicked rotator\n   0\n   1\n   2\n   3\n   4\n   5\n   6\n 0  0.5  1  1.5\nP(\n\u03b3)\n\u03b3\nTM\nTE\nn=3.6, RMT\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n 0  0.5  1  1.5\n \n\u03b3\nTM\nTE\nn=3.6, kicked rotator\nFIG. 1: Probability distribution P (\u03b3) of the scaled decay rate\n\u03b3m = \u22122 Im \u03b8m, obtained from the eigenvalue equation (20).\nIn the upper panels the refractive index is n = 1.5 while in\nthe lower panels n = 3.6. The left panels are computed in\nrandom-matrix theory, while the right panels are computed\nin the quantum kicked rotator model. The matrix dimension\nis M = 200 (solid curves) and M = 100 (dashed curves). The\nlabels TM and TE discriminate the different polarizations.\nEach curve is based on 105 realizations of U .\n(32). In order to present the results for the life times\nand laser threshold we use the scaled imaginary part\n\u03b3m = \u22122 Im \u03b8m = \u0393mL\u00af\/c.\nIn the following we contrast the case of a relatively\nopen resonator with refractive index n = 1.5 (close to\nthe value of glass) to a relatively closed resonator with\nn = 3.6 (close to the value of Ga(Al)As). In the random-\nmatrix model, the computations are based on 105 re-\nalizations of U from the COE with matrix dimension\nM = 100 or M = 200 [77]. In the kicked-rotator model,\nthe same number of matrices with identical dimensions\nare obtained by varying the parameters \u03b1, K1 and K2.\nWe also present n-dependent averages, which are based\non 104 realizations of U in each of the models.\nFigure 1 shows the probability distribution function\nP (\u03b3) of scaled decay rates for both polarizations and the\ntwo representative values of the refraction index. The\nresults obtained for matrices of dimension M = 100 and\n200 are very close, suggesting a mild dependence of P (\u03b3)\non the wavelength when the resonator size increases. For\nthe relatively closed resonator, n = 3.6, the distributions\nfound in both models are almost identical. For the rel-\natively open resonator with n = 1.5, however, the limit-\ning distribution in the random-matrix model is distinctly\ndifferent from the result in the quantum kicked rota-\ntor model. This demonstrates that universality starts to\nbreak down as the system becomes more open, due to the\ngreater influence of short-time dynamics (this breakdown\nhas been studied in more detail for the spectrum and res-\n 0\n 2\n 4\n 6\n 8\n 10\n 0  0.5  1  1.5\nP(\n\u03b3 0\n)\n\u03b30\nTM\nTE\nn=1.5, RMT\u039c=200\n\u039c=100\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n 0  0.5  1  1.5\n \n\u03b30\nTM\nTE\nn=1.5, kicked rotator\n 0\n 10\n 20\n 30\n 40\n 0  0.1  0.2\nP(\n\u03b3 0\n)\n\u03b30\nTM\nTE\nn=3.6, RMT\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n 0  0.1  0.2\n \n\u03b3\nTM\nTE\nn=3.6, kicked rotator\nFIG. 2: Probability distribution P (\u03b30) of the extremal (small-\nest) scaled decay rate \u03b30. The symbols and parameters are\nthe same as in Fig. 1.\nonance wave functions of ballistic systems in [40, 78, 79],\nusing semiclassical arguments). On the other hand, the\ncharacteristic qualitative features of the distributions dis-\nplay a robust parameter dependence. For both values of\nthe refractive index n and in both models, the TE po-\nlarization leads to larger decay rates compared to TM.\nFor a given polarization, the decay rates decrease with\nincreasing n. Both trends are consistent with the gen-\neral features of the Fresnel laws (5), which provide better\nconfinement for TM polarization, and for large refractive\nindices.\nFor each realization, the laser threshold is determined\nby the extremal resonance with the smallest rescaled de-\ncay rate, which we denote by \u03b30. Figure 2 shows the dis-\ntribution P (\u03b30) of the extremal decay rate for the same\nparameters as used in Fig. 1. Again the results from\nboth models coincide for the relatively closed resonator,\nwhile for the relatively open resonator the random-matrix\nmodel has a distinctively more narrow distribution than\nthe quantum kicked rotator model. In all cases, TM po-\nlarization yields smaller decay rates than TE polariza-\ntion, which is inherited from the behavior of P (\u03b3) in Fig.\n1. The results also show a trend to larger decay rates\nas the dimension M is increased. This trend can be ex-\nplained by the (hardly visible) sharpening of the small-\u03b3\nflank in the distribution function P (\u03b3) [Fig. 1] whenM is\nincreased, which suppresses the tail with very small de-\ncay rates. Such a sharpening has also been demonstrated\nin the random-matrix theory of cavities with small ballis-\ntic openings, where the distribution function eventually\nbecomes discontinuous [12, 60, 80, 81].\nFigure 3 shows the average value \u3008\u03b30\u3009 of the extremal\ndecay rate as a function of the refractive index n.

Solid symbols\nare obtained in random-matrix theory, while open symbols are\nobtained in the quantum kicked rotator model. Each data\npoint is based on 104 realizations of U with matrix dimension\nM = 200.\nkicked-rotator models agree very well. As expected from\nthe increasing confinement, \u3008\u03b30\u3009 decreases with increas-\ning refractive index n, and is smaller for TM polarization\nthan for TE polarization.\nWe now turn to the statistics of the Petermann fac-\ntor. Following the results from other variants of random-\nmatrix theory [44\u201346, 61, 73\u201376] it has to be expected\nthat the Petermann factor increases with increasing de-\ncay rate of a resonance, and moreover increases with in-\ncreasing number of outcoupling channels. In the present\nclass of systems this number is simply proportional toM .\nAnticipating these trends, we show in Fig. 4 the dis-\ntribution P (\u03ba) of rescaled Petermann factors \u03ba = K\/M .\nThe distribution represents the Petermann factor of all\nresonances, without discriminating them by width; pa-\nrameters are the same as in Fig. 1. The collapse of the\ncurves demonstrates clearly the linear scaling with M .\nSmaller Petermann factors are observed for TM polar-\nization and\/or increasing refractive index, which is con-\nsistent with the reduction of decay rates [see Fig. 1]. In\ncontrast to the distribution of decay rates, the results\nfrom the random-matrix and kicked-rotator model agree\nwell for both refractive indices, indicating that the Pe-\ntermann factor has a more universal statistics.\nFigure 5 shows the conditional probability distribution\nP (\u03ba|\u03b3), of Petermann factors with a given value of the\nrescaled decay rate. We again find an approximate lin-\near scaling withM . The dependence on polarization and\nrefractive index follows the same trends as in Fig. 4. Uni-\nversality is also present, since the results for both models\nare very similar.\nThe line width of the microlaser is determined by the\nPetermann factor of the longest-living resonance, which\nwe denote by K0 and refer to as the extremal Petermann\n 0\n 2\n 4\n 6\n 8\n 10\n 0  0.2  0.4  0.6  0.8  1\nP(\n\u03ba\n)\n\u03ba\nTM\nTE\nn=1.5, RMT\n\u039c=200\n\u039c=100\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n 0  0.2  0.4  0.6  0.8  1\n \n\u03ba\nTM\nTE\nn=1.5, kicked rotator\n 0\n 20\n 40\n 60\n 80\n 0  0.05  0.1  0.15\nP(\n\u03ba\n)\n\u03ba\nTM\nTE\nn=3.6, RMT\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n 0  0.05  0.1  0.15\n \n\u03ba\nTM\nTE\nn=3.6, kicked rotator\nFIG. 4: Probability distribution P (\u03ba) of the scaled Petermann\nfactor \u03ba = K\/M .

Results are shown for both polarizations\nand two matrix dimensions. The refractive index is n = 1.5.\nfactor. (For a given realization, this is not necessarily the\nsmallest Petermann factor among all the resonances.) As\nshown in Fig. 6, K0 does not scale linearly with M , but\nscales instead with\n\u221a\nM . This different parametric de-\npendence can be traced to the fact that the decay rate\nof the extremal resonance is not fixed [Fig. 2]. The same\nparametric dependence, but as a function of N , is also\nobtained in the random-matrix theory of cavities with\nsmall ballistic openings, where N \u00bfM [45, 46]. Accord-\ning to Fig. 6, the details of the statistics for the extremal\nPetermann factor are again non-universal for the rela-\ntively open resonator with n = 1.5 \u2014 the distribution in\nthe random-matrix model is more narrowly peaked than\nin the kicked-rotator model.\nSimilarly to what is observed in Fig. 4, the extremal\nPetermann factor in Fig. 6 is reduced when increasing\nrefractive index n. However, K0 displays a weaker po-\nlarization dependence. These trends are further under-\nlined in Fig. 7, which shows the ensemble average \u3008\u03ba\u02dc0\u3009\nof the scaled extremal Petermann factor \u03ba\u02dc0 = K0\/\n\u221a\nM .\n8 0\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 0  0.5  1  1.5\nP(\n\u03ba\u02dc\n0)\n\u03ba\u02dc0\nTM\nTE\nn=1.5, RMT\n\u039c=200\n\u039c=100\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n 0  0.5  1  1.5\n \n\u03ba\u02dc0\nTM\nTE\nn=1.5, kicked rotator\n 0\n 5\n 10\n 15\n 20\n 25\n 0  0.1  0.2  0.3\nP(\n\u03ba\u02dc\n0)\n\u03ba\u02dc0\nTM\nTE\nn=3.6, RMT\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n 0  0.1  0.2  0.3\n \n\u03b3\nTM\nTE\nn=3.6, kicked rotator\nFIG. 6: (color online) Probability distribution P (\u03ba\u02dc0) of the\nscaled extremal Petermann factor \u03ba\u02dc0 = K0\/\n\u221a\nM of the\nlongest-living resonance. The symbols and parameters are\nthe same as in Fig. 1.\nThis average is significantly larger than the modal value,\nwhich is due to the long tail in the distribution function.\nThe average decreases with increasing refractive index,\nsimilarly to the averaged extremal decay rate in Fig. 3.\nThe results from the random-matrix and kicked-rotator\nmodels converge for large refractive index.\nIn summary, Figs. 1\u20133 demonstrate that the laser\nthreshold of a wave-chaotic dielectric microresonator de-\ncreases for increasing refractive index n and is smaller for\nTM polarization than for TE polarization. The thresh-\nold increases slowly for increasing number of out-coupling\nmodes. Figures 6 and 7 show that the Petermann fac-\ntor of a wave-chaotic dielectric microresonator decreases\nfor increasing refractive index n and scales as the square-\nroot of the number of out-coupling modes, but is less\nsensitive to polarization. Figure 4 shows that this be-\nhavior critically depends on the requirement to determine\nthe longest-living resonance, which first reaches the laser\nthreshold.\nFor all quantities, details of the statistics are model-\ndependent for relatively open resonators, but become\nuniversal for relatively closed resonators with a large\nrefractive index (for very closed resonators the results\neventually converge to the predictions of conventional\nrandom-matrix theory [12, 44\u201346, 60, 61]).\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nThe quantum-dynamical model of dielectric microres-\nonators presented in this work addresses geometries\nwhich facilitate well-established wave chaos in the semi-\nclassical limit \u03bb \u00bf L, where L is the typical resonator\n 0\n 0.5\n 1\n 1  2  3  4\n\u2329\u03ba\u02dc 0\n\u232a\nn\nRMT TM\nRMT TE\nkicked rotator TM\nkicked rotator TE\nFIG. 7: Ensemble average \u3008\u03ba\u02dc0\u3009 of the scaled extremal Peter-\nmann factor \u03ba\u02dc0 = K0\/\n\u221a\nM as a function of refractive index\nn. The symbols and parameters are the same as in Fig. 3.\ndimension and \u03bb is the wave length. We developed two\nvariants of the model, one being based on random matrix\ntheory while the other is based on the quantum-kicked\nrotator. In general, we found that relatively closed res-\nonators (with a large refractive index) display universal\nstatistics while model-dependence sets in for relatively\nopen resonators (with a small refractive index). In the\nlatter case the non-universal features even affect long-\nliving resonances, which classically correspond to rays\nwhich enjoy many internal reflections at the dielectric\ninterfaces.\nThe longest-living resonances determine the laser ac-\ntion of the resonator. We concentrated most of our ef-\nforts on the laser threshold and the quantum-limited line\nwidth, which should be directly accessible in a suitable\nexperiment. We found that among the two competing\npolarizations, TM will usually win the mode competition\nfor the most stable resonance. The threshold decreases\nwith increasing refractive index. The Petermann factor\nin the line width also decreases with increasing refractive\nindex, and furthermore scales \u221d\u221aL\/\u03bb.\nExperimentally, Petermann factors of the laser mode\nhave been determined for various geometries in Ref. [57\u2013\n59]. Recent experimental progress [82] now makes it pos-\nsible to address the life time and Petermann factors of\nindividual resonances via direct means. These methods\nare not restricted to the longest living resonance, and do\nnot require an active medium (they, hence, also apply\nto passive or absorbing resonators). Such an experiment\ncould serve to validate the different scaling \u221d L\/\u03bb of Pe-\ntermann factors for resonances of a fixed decay rate.\nMany microresonators of interest have a geometry\nwhich facilitates ray chaos only in parts of the classi-\ncal phase space [4, 14\u201323]. While random-matrix the-\nory is not applicable to these systems, the kicked-rotator\nmodel can readily account for such situations when the\nkicking strengths are suitably reduced. In general, Eq.\n9(12) for the scattering matrix provides a vehicle to study\na wide range of situations, including integrable or dis-\nordered systems, by a suitable round-trip operator RU .\nEquation (23) for the laser threshold and Eq. (32) for the\nPetermann factor do not depend on the specific choice of\nthe round-trip operator and can serve as a starting point\nfor further analytical considerations.\nThis work was supported by the EPSRC and by the\nEuropean Commission, Marie Curie Excellence Grant\nMEXT-CT-2005-023778.\n[1] Focus issue Single photons on demand, edited by P.\nGrangier, B.
