Indeed, such ligands have found \nprominence in both early and late transition metal catalysis. In \nparticular, diamido-donor ligands derived from aryl-substituted \ndien ligands (A, Fig. 1) have proved compatible ligands for \npreparing early transition metal catalysts (e.g., Zr and Hf).1 On \nthe other hand, the more rigid neutral bis(arylimino)pyridine \nligands have led the way for generating catalysts based on \niron,2,3 cobalt2,3 and vanadium centres.4 In common to both the \ndianionic and neutral N,N,N-ligands, is the presence of N-aryl \nsubstituents which can be readily modified with regard to both \ntheir steric and electronic properties. Moreover, the nature of the \naryl substitution pattern may play a key role in influencing the \nperformance of the catalyst.\nWe have recently been attracted by the use of more flexible \nnitrogen donor ligands as potential supports for late transition \nmetal catalysts. One candidate for the role is the dipicolylamine \nligand (dpa, Fig. 1) which possess a saturated backbone but lacks \nsteric bulk and, as a result, has a propensity for formation of cata-\nlytically undesirable complexes of the type [M(dpa)2]2+ (M = Fe, \nCo).5 Herein, we report our efforts at modifying the dpa ligand ar-\nchitecture by replacing one of the picolyl groups with a sterically \nvariable N-aryl-substituted ethylamine to furnish a new family \nof ligands termed N-picolyen (B, Fig. 1). Cobalt(II) and iron(II) \nchloride complexes containing B, and also A, are described as are \ntheir application as precatalysts in olefin oligomerisation.\n2 Results and discussion\n(a) Synthesis of the ligands\nThe ligands [(ArNHCH2CH2){(2-C5H4N)CH2}NH] (Ar = 2,6-\nMe2C6H3, 2,4,6-Me3C6H2) were synthesised in high yield by \na palladium catalysed N\u2013C(aryl) coupling reaction of N-\npicolyethylenediamine [prepared by treating 2-chloroethylamine \nwith excess 2-(aminomethyl)pyridine)] with one equivalent of \nthe corresponding aryl bromide (Scheme 1) using experimental \nprotocols established by Buchwald and Hartwig.6 A similar pal-\nladium catalysed coupling reaction was employed for the synthesis \nof [(ArNHCH2CH2)2NH] (Ar = 2,6-Me2C6H3, 2,4,6-Me3C6H21b) \nby treating diethylenetriamine with either two equivalents of 2-\nbromo-m-xylene or 2-bromomesitylene, respectively. All the new \nligands have been characterised by IR, 1H and 13C NMR spectros-\ncopy, mass spectrometry (FAB or ES) (see Experimental section).\n(b) Synthesis of the complexes\n(i) Reaction of MCl2 with (ArNHCH2CH2){(2-\nC5H4N)CH2}NH.

The N,N,N-chelate adopts a fac \nconfiguration with N(1) located 1.871(1) \u00c5 out of the plane \ndefined by N(3)\u2013N(2)\u2013Co(1). The aryl group is oriented such \nthat the ortho-methyl groups [C(15), C(16)] are positioned above \nand the below the plane defined by N(3)\u2013N(2)\u2013Co(1) [torsion \nangle: C(10)\u2013C(9)\u2013N(3)\u2013Co(1) 46.4(1)\u00b0] with one ortho-methyl \n[C(15)] pointing in a similar direction to the equatorial chloride \natom [Cl(1)]. The Co\u2013N distances are far from equivalent \nwith the longest involving the aryl-substituted amine nitrogen \n[Co(1)\u2013N(3) 2.209(1) \u00c5] and the shortest involving the pyridyl \nnitrogen [Co(1)\u2013N(1) 2.089(2) \u00c5]; the shortness of the latter \ncan presumably be attributed to some dp\u2013pp overlap between \nmetals and pyridyl nitrogen atoms. There is also a difference \nobserved for the Co\u2013Cl distances with the equatorial chloride \nbeing longer than the axial chloride [Co(1)\u2013Cl(1) 2.360(1) \u00c5 vs. \nCo(1)\u2013Cl(2) 2.283(1) \u00c5]. The Cl\u2013Co\u2013Cl angle at 103.09(2)\u00b0 falls \nbelow the range found in bis(imino)pyridine-containing cobalt \ndichloride complexes7 but compares well with less rigid N,N,N-\nchelated five-coordinate cobalt dichloride complexes.8 Due to \nthe centric nature of the space group, both R\/R and S\/S forms \nare present for the two chiral centres at N(1) and N(2) in the \ncrystal of 1b (also 1a).\nIn the FAB mass spectrum of 1a and 1b molecular ion peaks \nare observed along with fragmentation peaks corresponding \nto the loss of chloride ligands; very minor peaks relating to \ndimeric species are also evident.

The N,N,N-chelate \nadopts a mer-configuration with the N(1)\u2013Fe(1)\u2013N(3) angle \nbeing 153.28(6)\u00b0 and the deviation from planarity displayed by \nthe N(1)\u2013N(2)\u2013N(3)\u2013Fe(1) plane minimal [max. deviation: Fe(1) \n0.018 \u00c5]. The secondary amine terminus of the ligand possesses \nthe aryl substituent which is inclined at an angle of 69.2(1)\u00b0 \nto the N(1)\u2013N(2)\u2013N(3)\u2013Fe(1) plane with its ipso-carbon atom \n[C(9)] sitting 0.733(1) \u00c5 out of the plane and on the same side \nas Cl(2). The ortho-methyl groups of the aryl group sit above \nand below the N(1)\u2013N(2)\u2013N(3)\u2013Fe(1) plane [deviation from \nplane: C(16) 2.923(1), C(15) 1.478(1) \u00c5], with C(16) pointing \nin a similar direction to Cl(1). There is a difference in the Fe\u2013N \nbond lengths with the distance to the pyridyl donor being the \nshortest [Fe(1)\u2013N(1) 2.178(1) \u00c5] and to the arylamine the \nlongest [Fe(1)\u2013N(3) 2.296(1) \u00c5]. Similarly, the Fe\u2013Cl distances \nare asymmetric with the distance to the apical chloride the \nlongest [Fe(1)\u2013Cl(1) 2.398(1) \u00c5 vs. Fe(1)\u2013Cl(2) 2.285(1) \u00c5]. The \nCl\u2013Fe\u2013Cl angle at 109.24(2)\u00b0 falls in the lower end of the range \nfor the corresponding angle in related complexes.9 As with 1a \nand 1b, both R\/R and S\/S forms of the complex are present \nwithin the crystal of 2a.\nThe molecular structure of 2b is shown in Fig. 4; selected \nbond distances and angles are listed in Table 3. The struc-\nture consists of  a dimeric unit generated through a crystallo-\ngraphically imposed inversion centre. The iron centres are \nbridged by two chloride ligands and bound terminally by a \nchloride and a mesityl-substituted N-picolylen ligand to give \na pseudo-octahedral geometry at each metal centre. The two \nN-picolylen ligands adopt facial bonding modes such that the \npyridyl and the aryl-substituted amine moieties are trans to the \nbridging chlorides and the central amine trans to a terminal \nchloride. At each metal centre the pyridyl nitrogen\u2013iron \ndistance [Fe(1)\u2013N(1) 2.168(2) \u00c5] is the shortest of  the three \nFe\u2013N distances while the aryl-substituted amine\u2013iron distance \nthe longest [Fe(1)\u2013N(3) 2.334(2) \u00c5]. The Fe\u2013l-Cl distances are \nsimilar [Fe(1)\u2013Cl(1) 2.509(1), Fe(1)\u2013Cl(1A) 2.546(1) \u00c5] and \nDespite the molecular structures of 2a and 2b being \nmonomeric and dimeric respectively, their FAB mass spectra are \nsimilar. Both show peaks consistent with the loss of a chloride \nligands from a monomeric species, [(N-picolylen)FeCl2], along \nwith minor peaks attributable to chloride loss from dimeric \nspecies, [(N-picolylen)FeCl2]2. In the IR spectrum the m(N\u2013H) \nabsorption bands are seen at ca. 3150 cm\u22121 and shifted to a lower \nwavenumber than that in the corresponding free ligands. The \nmagnetic susceptibility measurement for 2a gives a magnetic \nmoment of 4.9 lB (Evans balance at ambient temperature) \nwhich is consistent with a high spin configuration possessing \nfour unpaired electrons. In dimeric 2b, a magnetic moment of \n7.4 lB is observed which is consistent with two non-interacting \nhigh spin metal centres. Indeed, cooling of 2b down to 50 K \nshows little variation in the magnetic moment.11\nAlthough the complexes are paramagnetic, 1H NMR \nspectroscopy can be informative.

Some degree of assignment can be made \non comparison of the chemical shifts and relaxation times in \n2a and 2b with the related iron(II) complexes [(fac-dpa)FeCl(l-\nCl)2ClFe(fac-dpa)] and [(tpa)FeCl2] (tpa = tripicolylamine) in \nwhich the pyridyl (Ha, Hb and Hc) and methylene protons of the \npicolyl group have characteristic chemical shifts.5,12 Typically, \nHa is observed most downfield (115\u2013130 ppm) while Hc most \nupfield (6\u201320 ppm). In between these signals are located the Hb \nand CH2 signals. The aromatic signals have been assigned on the \nbasis of integration and by direct comparison between the two \nspectra (mesityl vs. 2,6-dimethyphenyl). In particular, the para-\nsubstituent of the aryl group can be informative with the Mep \nin 2b appearing at d 15.7 while in 2a this is signal is absent but \nreplaced by Hp at d \u22125.4.\nWhat is clear from the two spectra, despite the difference \nin the solid-state structures, both behave similarly in solution \nat room temperature. Scheme 3 shows a series of equilibria \nthat can explain the apparent dynamic behaviour of 2a and \n2b. Dissociation of the arylamine arm of the ligand in mer-2a \ncould generate a four-coordinate iron complex containing a \npendant amine group. Inversion of the stereochemistry of the \npendant amine, some reorganisation of the ethyl unit, followed \nby recoordination would generate the fac-coordinated species A. \nAs the bulky aryl group is now remote from the chloride ligands, \ndimerisation can occur to give a fac-coordinated dimer (isolated \nfor 2b). On the other hand, recoordination following inversion \nwould generate the mer-species B, while recoordination without \ninversion would generate fac-C. Notably C, although not \nisolated with iron as the metal centre, has been structurally \ncharacterised for cobalt (1a and 1b). Some support for the \npostulated lability of the aryl-substituted arylamino arm is \ngiven on inspection of the M\u2013N distances in 2a and 2b, in which \nthe corresponding Fe\u2013N distances are ca. 0.1 \u00c5 longer than \nthe other M\u2013N distances. A related dissociation of an amino \ngroup in a N,N,N-chelate has previously been observed in a five-\ncoordinate group 4 system.13\nTable 3 Selected bond distances (\u00c5) and angles (\u00b0) for 2b\nFe(1)\u2013N(1) 2.168(2) Fe(1)\u2013Cl(2) 2.310(1)\nFe(1)\u2013N(2) 2.218(2) Fe(1)\u2013Cl(1A) 2.546(1)\nFe(1)\u2013N(3) 2.334(2) Fe(1)\ue04cFe(1A) 3.600(1)\nFe(1)\u2013Cl(1) 2.509(1)\nCl(1)\u2013Fe(1)\u2013N(3) 81.06(6) Cl(2)\u2013Fe(1)\u2013Cl(1A) 96.56(3)\nCl(1)\u2013Fe(1)\u2013Cl(2) 94.41(2) N(3)\u2013Fe(1)\u2013N(1) 103.43(7)\nCl(1)\u2013Fe(1)\u2013N(1) 162.93(6) N(3)\u2013Fe(1)\u2013N(2) 77.24(7)\nCl(1)\u2013Fe(1)\u2013Cl(1A) 89.19(2) N(3)\u2013Fe(1)\u2013Cl(1A) 162.33(5)\nCl(1)\u2013Fe(1)\u2013N(2) 87.88(5) N(1)\u2013Fe(1)\u2013N(2) 77.27(7)\nCl(2)\u2013Fe(1)\u2013N(1) 101.05(6) N(1)\u2013Fe(1)\u2013Cl(1A) 81.94(5)\nCl(2)\u2013Fe(1)\u2013N(3) 98.84(5) N(2)\u2013Fe(1)\u2013Cl(1A) 87.76(6)\nCl(2)\u2013Fe(1)\u2013N(2) 175.13(6)\nThe atoms labelled with a suffix are generated by symmetry \n(\u2212x, 1 \u2212 y, \u2212z).\nFig. 5 Paramagnetically shifted 1H NMR spectra for complexes 2a and 2b in acetonitrile-d3.\nIn order to probe the relative stabilities of  the mer and fac \nisomers for the cobalt and iron chloride complexes containing \naryl-substituted N-picolylen ligands, DFT (B3LYP) calculations \nwere undertaken. Geometry optimisations were carried out on \n[{((2,6-Me2C6H3)NHCH2CH2)((2-C5H4N)CH2)NH}MCl2] \n[M = Co (1a) or Fe (2a)] for both mer-RR and fac-RR \nconformations taking into account the high spin state of all \nspecies. All unpaired electrons are located on the metal centre: \nfour and three for the Fe and Co complexes, respectively. \nDifferent electronic repartitions of the metals d orbitals have \nbeen considered for both 1a and 2a and the lowest energetic ones \nwere selected for geometry optimisation.\nOptimised structures of the fac and mer complexes for 1a and \n2a are depicted in Fig. 6; geometrical parameters are listed in \nTable 4. Overall, experimental and theoretical structures for fac-\n1a and mer-2a complexes are in good agreement. In particular, \nthe optimised values for the internal bond lengths and angles \nof the tridentate ligand compare well with the experimental \nScheme 3 Aryl\u2013amino nitrogen dissociation in 2a and recoordination \npossibilities.\nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n o\nn \n27\n A\nug\nus\nt 2\n00\n4.\n D\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n U\nni\nve\nrs\nity\n o\nf L\nei\nce\nste\nr o\nn \n20\n\/0\n8\/\n20\n13\n 1\n6:\n56\n:1\n3.\n \nView Article Online\n3 2 3 4 D a l t o n  T r a n s . ,  2 0 0 4 ,  3 2 3 1 \u2013 3 2 4 0 D a l t o n  T r a n s . ,  2 0 0 4 ,  3 2 3 1 \u2013 3 2 4 0 3 2 3 5\nones (values not reported). The most important discussion \nfocused on the coordination sphere of the metal centre. The \noptimised M\u2013ligand bond lengths (especially the M\u2013N ones) \nare slightly longer that the experimental ones for both the fac-1a \nand mer-2a, with discrepancies less than 0.1 \u00c5; discrepancies of \nthis magnitude are sometimes observed with high spin systems \nstudied by B3LYP.14 Further comparison of the first coordina-\ntion sphere of the metal atoms reveals that some reorganisation \nof the ligands occurs between experimental and theoretical \nstructures. The most noticeable is the Cl(1)\u2013M(1)\u2013Cl(2) angle \nwith discrepancies of 14\u00b0 in 1a (computed 118.3\u00b0 vs. experimental \n104.3\u00b0) to 20.9\u00b0 in 2a (computed 130.2\u00b0 vs. experimental \n109.3\u00b0). Interestingly, the values of the Cl(1)\u2013M(1)\u2013Cl(2) \noptimised angles are significantly closer to those observed in the \nmolecular structures of 3a and 3b (see later, 114.4 and 113.3\u00b0, \nrespectively). To further investigate the relevance of these struc-\ntural differences, geometry optimisations of fac-1a and mer-\n2a were carried out by fixing the Cl(1)\u2013M(1)\u2013Cl(2) angle to \ntheir experimental values (104.3 and 109.3\u00b0 respectively), and \noptimising all the other geometrical variables. Comparison \nbetween experimental, fully optimised and partially optimised \nstructures shows that the increase of the Cl(1)\u2013M(1)\u2013Cl(2) angle \nis related to the rotation of the aryl group and the pyridine (to \na lesser extent) around their N\u2013C bond. Analysis of the whole \nunit cell of  both crystals shows that significant p-stacking and \nother \u2018long distance\u2019 contacts exist between monomers in the \ncrystals. The observed rearrangements in the optimised struc-\ntures are therefore associated with the vacuum condition of the \ncalculations as compared to the packing environment of the \nexperimental system. This observation associated with the low \ndifference in potential energy between the partially optimised \nand fully optimised structures of fac-1a and mer-2a (fully \noptimised structures in both cases are 1.7 kcal mol\u22121 more stable \nthan the partially optimised ones) show that the discrepancies of \nthe Cl(1)\u2013M(1)\u2013Cl(2) angle are not physically significant.\nGeometry optimisations of the non-experimentally \ncharacterised structures fac-2a and mer-1a have been carried out \nusing B3LYP and lead to two stable structures. The optimised \nfac-2a and mer-1a structures (Fig. 6) are in good agreement with \nthe data presented for fac-1a and mer-2a. In particular, the bond \nlengths do not change significantly between the computed fac- \nand mer-isomers (Table 4). With regard to the Cl(1)\u2013M(1)\u2013Cl(2) \nangle, these optimised structures show the same tendency for \na more accentuated angle (121.8 and 119.2\u00b0 for fac-2a and \nmer-1a respectively) than the experimental fac-2a and mer-1a \nconformers. Therefore, theoretical calculations lead to two \nstable fac- and mer-conformers for both 1a and 2a.\nThe difference in free Gibbs energy between fac- and mer-\nconformers for both 1a and 2a has been calculated with the \nequation DG0 = G0fac \u2212 G0mer. The differences of enthalpy are \nalso provided as indicative values. For the cobalt compound 1a, \nDG0 = \u22121.04 kcal mol\u22121 (DH 0 = \u22120.84 kcal mol\u22121), and for the iron \ncompound 2a, DG0 = 2.41 kcal mol\u22121 (DH 0 = 2.41 kcal mol\u22121). \nSeveral points emerge; firstly, these results show that for \nboth cobalt and iron species, fac- and mer-conformations are \nvery close in energy. Secondly, for 1a, the fac-conformer is \napproximately 1 kcal mol\u22121 more stable than the mer one, while \nfor 2a, the mer-conformer is approximately 2.5 kcal mol\u22121 \nmore stable than the fac one. These results concur with the \nexperimental observations with fac-1a and mer-2a being the \nmost stable conformers.\nIn summary, the computed energetics in the gas phase for the \ntwo isomers reproduce properly the nature of the most stable \nisomer for both cobalt and iron in the crystalline state. Indeed, \nthe low energy difference between fac- and mer-structures for \nboth iron and cobalt would suggest an equilibrium to be likely \nin solution which is confirmed by the 1H NMR studies of 2 (vide \nsupra). However, these calculations do not take into account \nthe possible mechanism involved in the transition from one \nconformer to the other.\n(ii) Reaction of CoCl2 with (ArNHCH2CH2)2NH. \nThe reaction of (ArNHCH2CH2)2NH with CoCl2 \nin n-BuOH at elevated temperature gave complexes \n[{(ArNHCH2CH2)2NH}CoCl2] (Ar = 2,6-Me2C6H3 3a, 2,4,6-\nMe3C6H2 3b) in high yield (Scheme 4).

The magnetic susceptibility \nmeasurements for 3a and 3b reveal magnetic moments of ca. 3.95 \nlB (Evans balance at ambient temperature) which are indicative \nof high spin configurations possessing three unpaired electrons. \nThe 1H NMR spectra of 3a and 3b exhibit characteristic broad \nand paramagnetically shifted peaks but afforded no informative \ninformation with respect to peak assignment.\nNo DFT calculations were performed on the relative stability \nof the mer- and possible fac-isomers for 3, but it is likely that the \nobserved mer isomer is preferred on steric grounds. Similarly, \na mer structure is observed in the related diamido complex \n[{(ArNCH2CH2)2NMe}ZrMe2] (Ar = 2,4,6-Me3C6H2); forma-\ntion of the alkyl cation notably leads to a facially coordinated \nspecies.1\n(c) Ethylene oligomerisation\nAll the complexes were tested for oligomerisation \/ polymerisation \nactivity by treating them with 400 equivalents of MAO in toluene \nunder an ethylene pressure (1 bar) and ambient temperature. In \nall cases oligomeric material was afforded; the results of  the \ntests are shown in Table 6. The most active systems contain \ncobalt as the metal centre (1 and 3) with entry 1 the highest at \n59 g mmol\u22121 h\u22121 bar\u22121. The iron systems (entries 2 and 3) display \nmuch lower activities when compared to the corresponding \ncobalt complexes and are ca. 5000 times less active than most \nproductive bis(imino)pyridine iron oligomerisation catalysts \n(under similar conditions).2,3\nThe nature of the oligomeric material does show some \ndifferences from that obtained using bis(imino)pyridine \ncatalysts. While the iron-based systems behave similarly giving \ngreater than 95% linear a-olefins (C6\u2013C26), the cobalt systems \ngive mixtures of linear and branched products (C6\u2013C26). Indeed, \nextensive isomerisation is evident with terminal and internal \nolefins present along with vinylidenes, R1R2C\ue0adCH2, and small \namounts of trisubstituted alkenes, R1R2C\ue0adCHR3 (Fig. 8). \nFor both the iron and cobalt systems a coordinative-insertion \nmechanism seems likely followed by a b-H elimination. To \nexplain the branched components of the oligomers, insertion \nof a terminal olefin into a Co\u2013R bond seems likely, followed \nby b-H elimination. For both the iron systems the oligomeric \ndistribution is found to follow a Schulz\u2013Flory distribution for \nboth 2a and 2b with the Schulz\u2013Flory parameter a in both cases \nbeing around 0.8.15\nThe observation that 1 and 2 result in oligomeric materials is \nconsistent with a rapid chain transfer process as a consequence \nof there being insufficient steric bulk to prevent associative \ndisplacement of the growing oligomeric chain. Indeed iron \ncomplexes containing sterically bulky 2-iminobipyridine \nligands afford only short-chain oligomeric products.16 However, \nfor 3 which possess 2,6-substituted groups on both sides of the \nScheme 4 Reagents and conditions: (i) n-BuOH, 90 \u00b0C; (ii) (ArNH-\nCH2CH2)2NH (Ar = 2,6-Me2C6H3, 2,4,6-Me3C6H2), n-BuOH, 90 \u00b0C.\nFig. 7 Molecular structure of 3a including the atom numbering \nscheme.

The structures of 3a \nand 3b are essentially the same and only 3a will be discussed in \ndetail. A view of 3a is shown in Fig. 7; selected bond distances \nand angles are listed for both 3a and 3b in Table 5. The structure \nof 3a consists of a cobalt atom surrounded by a single chelating \ntridentate 2,6-dimethylphenyl-substituted dien ligand and two \nmonodentate chloride ligands. The five-coordinate geometry \ncan be best described as distorted trigonal bipyramidal with \nN(3) and N(1) forming the axial sites and N(1), Cl(1) and \nCl(2) the equatorial sites. The dien ligand adopts, unlike in 1a \nand 1b, a mer configuration with the N(1)\u2013Co(1)\u2013N(3) angle \nbeing 160.08(7)\u00b0 and the deviation from planarity displayed \nby the N(1)\u2013N(2)\u2013N(3)\u2013Co(1) plane minimal [max. deviation: \nCo(1) 0.063 \u00c5]. Each terminal nitrogen atom of the dien ligand \npossesses an aryl substituent which are positioned mutually \ncis with both ipso-carbon atoms [C(11) and C(1)] ca. 0.68 \u00c5 \nbelow the N(1)\u2013N(2)\u2013N(3)\u2013Co(1) plane and on the same \nside as Cl(1). The ortho-methyl groups of each aryl group sit \nabove and below the N(1)\u2013N(2)\u2013N(3)\u2013Co(1) plane [deviation \nof o-Me groups from plane: C(6A) 1.341(1), C(16A) 1.799(1), \nC(2A) 2.885(1), C(12A) 2.919(1) \u00c5] with the two located above \n[C(6A) and C(16A)] pointing in a similar direction to Cl(2). \nThere is a difference in the Co\u2013N bond lengths with the central \nN\u2013Co distance being noticeably shorter than the terminal N\u2013Co \nbond lengths [Co(1)\u2013N(2) 2.082(2) \u00c5 vs. Co(1)\u2013N(1) 2.219(3), \nCo(1)\u2013N(3) 2.243(2) \u00c5]. There is also a difference observed for \nthe Co\u2013Cl distances with that involving Cl(2) being longer than \nthat to Cl(1) [Co(1)\u2013Cl(2) 2.350(1) \u00c5 vs. Co(1)\u2013Cl(1) 2.269(1) \u00c5]. \nThe Cl\u2013Co\u2013Cl angle at 114.91(4)\u00b0 falls in the same range as those \nobserved for the bis(imino)pyridine-containing cobalt dichloride \ncomplexes.7 As with the N-picolylen-systems (1 and 2), 3 also \nhas two chiral centres, in this case located on the termini of the \nN,N,N-chelate at N(1) and N(3). Both 3a and 3b crystallise with \nthe relative configurations of the chiral centres being distinct.\nThe FAB mass spectrum of 3a and 3b both display molecular \nion peaks and peaks corresponding to the loss of chloride \nligands; no evidence for dimerised products is observed. \nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n o\nn \n27\n A\nug\nus\nt 2\n00\n4.\n D\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n U\nni\nve\nrs\nity\n o\nf L\nei\nce\nste\nr o\nn \n20\n\/0\n8\/\n20\n13\n 1\n6:\n56\n:1\n3.\n \nView Article Online\n3 2 3 6 D a l t o n  T r a n s . ,  2 0 0 4 ,  3 2 3 1 \u2013 3 2 4 0 D a l t o n  T r a n s . ,  2 0 0 4 ,  3 2 3 1 \u2013 3 2 4 0 3 2 3 7\nThe reagents, 2-(aminomethyl)pyridine, diethylenetriamine, \nsodium tert-butoxide, the aryl halides, MAO (10% wt solution \nin toluene) and the metal dichlorides were purchased from \nAldrich Chemical Co. and used without further purification. \nrac-BINAP was purchased from Strem Chemical Co.

This was repeated and the contents of  the two \nflasks (0.206 mol) combined. The free 2-chloroethylamine \nwas then added dropwise to a rapidly stirred solution of  2-\n(aminomethyl)pyridine (44.0 g, 0.407 mol) in absolute ethanol \n(50 cm3) and refluxed for 2 h.

Both the experimental results and \ncalculations indicate that fac- and mer-structures are possible \nfor this ligand type with the energy difference between each \nminimal. Moreover, interconversion between structures in \nsolution has been shown to be a facile process. Application \nof  1 and 2 along with the aryl-substituted dien cobalt comp-\nlexes (3) as catalysts for the oligomerisation of  ethylene has \nbeen demonstrated. While only modest activities result, both \nlinear and branched oligomeric materials are accessible. The \nconformation of  the tridentate nitrogen donor ligands in the \ncatalytically active species is uncertain and will be the subject \nof  further studies.\n3  Experimental\n3.1 General\nAll reactions were carried out under an atmosphere of dry, \noxygen-free nitrogen, using standard Schlenk techniques or \nin a nitrogen purged glove box.
