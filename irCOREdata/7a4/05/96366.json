The paper studies the ongoing construction of the UK\u2019s computing grid for particle physics \n(GridPP), a grid that is itself part of the world\u2019s largest grid, the Large Hadron Collider Computing \nGrid (LHC). We observe in this project a collective, agile and distributed performance through which \nthe Grid is constructed. We express this through the concept of \u201ccollective agility\u201d which captures a \nlarge distributed performance rather than the more conventional sense of agility as small-group and \ndeliberate systems development practices. The collective agility of GridPP is analysed as a process of \n\u201cenacted emergence\u201d expressed through the dynamics of six improvisation-paradoxes.  \nKey words: collective agility, improvisation, paradox, grid computing, particle physics  \n \n \n  2 \n \n1. Introduction \nMuch recent innovation in systems development has sought to legitimise a more fluid, exploratory and \nresponsive style (Baskerville and Pries-Heje, 2004; Baskerville et al., 2006; Baskerville et al., 1992; \nFowler and Highsmith, 2001; Truex et al., 2000). These moves away from traditional formalism in \nsystems development methodologies (e.g. Boehm 1988; DeMarco 1978) echo the long-standing \nobservation from the field that traditional methodologies are neither effectively nor extensively used \n(Avgerou and Cornford, 1993, Bansler and Bodker, 1993), but often \u201cfaked\u201d (Parnas and Clements, \n1986) and used as a \u201cfiction\u201d to help create a sense of coherence in day-to-day activities \n(Nandhakumar and Avison, 1999). Such observations have caused some to rethink the status of \nmethod and methodology in systems development. Ciborra (2002), for example, asks us to \u201csuspend \nthe belief that behind the messy everyday reality there is a geometric universe\u201d. Similarly, Truex and \nassociates argue that \u201camethodical\u201d development (Truex et al., 2000) can better appreciate and support \ninnovation and organisational change, adaptation and experimentation, as well as exploiting new \nopportunities and accidents. If we understand organisational landscapes to be emergent or enacted \n(Weick, 2001, Weick, 1993b), and that technology is created \u2018in-practice\u2019 (Orlikowski, 2000), it \nmakes sense to argue that the way we develop information systems should support a strong contextual \ncontingency and allow for improvisational action and bricolage (Bansler and Havn, 2004).  \nAgile Systems Development \nMany contemporary systems development practices are oriented towards speed, responsiveness and \nflexibility. These practices have been given names such as \u201chigh speed software development\u201d \n(Baskerville et al., 2006), \u201cshort-cycle time systems development\u201d (Baskerville and Pries-Heje, 2004), \n\u201cweb-based system development\u201d (Kautz et al., 2007), and most influentially, agile systems \ndevelopment (Conboy and Fitzgerald, 2004; Fowler and Highsmith, 2001; Highsmith, 2002). Agile \ndevelopment has established a large research literature in the past few years, and an extensive \nfollowing within the practitioner community, based on principles characterised by quickness, lightness \nand nimbleness (Highsmith, 2002) and on values such as collaboration, communication, simplicity and \ncourage (Beck and Andres, 2005). The practitioner literature includes many versions such as rapid \nprototyping or quick releases, placing emphasis from predefined procedures, specification and \nsystematic methods (Beck and Andres, 2005; Highsmith, 2002; Williams and Cockburn, 2003). But \nmost studies of agile development still focus on micro behaviour and related processes in designing \nand delivering software, and less attention is paid to organisational cultures, institutional conditions \nand environmental constraints (Abrahamsson et al., 2009). This is surprising since, from the days of \nBrooks\u2019 classic \u2018The Mythical Man Month\u2019 (1979) and DeRamer and Kron\u2019s (1975) concept of \n\u2018programming in the large\u2019, it has been acknowledged that systems are developed within an \n  3 \norganisational environment, which is as significant in shaping the character of the project and its \noutcomes as any particular practices. There is thus a need to develop a better understanding of the \nimplementation of agility at the organisational level (Abrahamsson et al., 2009) acknowledging \nexplicit linkages to institutional and cultural settings. \nLarge-scale systems development projects in particular are known to face many challenges as they \nspan institutional and cultural settings. Curtis et al. (1988) suggest that the three most salient and \ninterrelated problems they face are: thin spread of application domain knowledge; fluctuating and \nconflicting requirements and; communication and coordination breakdowns. To adopt a style of agile \nsystems development in such settings entails particular difficulties (Reifer et al., 2003), including \ncommunication, lack of control and lack of trust (Ramesh et al., 2006). The strategies proposed to \n\u2018scale-up\u2019 agile development include developing collaboration tools (Flor, 2006), aligning IT \ncomponents (Lee et al., 2006), and managing carefully the balance between flexibility and rigour (Lee, \nDeLone and Espinosa, 2006). Yet few attempts have been made to directly theorise agility and \ndistributed organisational dynamics.  \nThe LCG Project \nIn this paper we study an emergent form of agile practice within a specific and distinctive large scale \nand distributed organisational context \u2013 the Large Hadron Collider Computing Grid (LCG) - one of \nthe world\u2019s largest computing grids. This started development in 2001 and was formally put into use \nin 2010. The organisational context of the LCG, reflecting that of particle physics (Knorr-Cetina, \n1999; Traweek, 1988), is highly distributed with 170 computing centres in 34 countries. Mobilising to \nbuild this Grid was a grand systems development challenge in technical, organisational, political and \nhuman terms; an example of large scale system development on a global basis and one which, as we \nwill argue, seemed to exhibit a quality of agility. Thus we observed fluid practices that serve as a \ncontinuous response to external and internal changes, and continual acts of trial and error matched \nwith pragmatic problem-solving approaches. Bricolage and ad hoc activities dominate the day-to-day \nand there is minimal, though vital, use of formal methodologies and centralised control. The people \ninvolved, mostly physicists or physicist-programmers, take pride not in methodological rigour but in \ntheir pragmatic approach to \u201cmake it work\u201d. As a large distributed project, LCG has faced challenges \nas mentioned above, and yet their response has not been to employ rationalistic approaches or \nconstraining tool-sets as most of the authors above propose, but rather to respond by maintaining their \ncommitment to a flexible and fluid approach \u2013 to agility.  \nThe Concept of Agility \nThe literature on agility reflects two common approaches. The first sees agility as empirically \nvalidated small group methods and practices. The second sees agility as an organisational capability \n  4 \n(Sambamurthy et al. 2003; Lee et al., 2006; Mathiassen and Pries-Heje, 2006), for example, a firms\u2019 \nsense-and-respond capabilities, or dynamic capabilities (Williams and Cockburn 2003), or the \norganisational capability to learn, to explore and to exploit knowledge (Mathiassen and Vainio, 2007; \nOverby et al., 2006). We develop a third and distinct perspective, what we call collective agility seen \nas a \u201cstructuring property\u201d (Giddens, 1984) of a collective, instantiated in improvisational behaviour \nof individuals and groups and in their social interactions. In other words, collective agility is an \nattribute emergent from the day-to-day practices of social actors. We thus explore agility as a \nperformance (Ciborra, 1999; Dyba, 2000). \nIt is important to make clear the ontological distinction implied by a focus on capability or \nperformance: capability refers to the potential for achievement that an organisation has as it draws \nupon its resources, human, institutional and material, a concept linked to the resource based view of \nthe firm and core competencies (Wade and Hulland, 2004). In contrast, a performance is an enactment \nwithin a context that can create, apply and sustain capabilities. Put another way, capabilities are not \nunderstood here as something held prior to a performance, rather they are the medium and outcome of \nit. The performative ontology (Pickering, 1995) adopted here sees agility as what social actors do \nwhen engaging with uncertainty and complexity, and as sustained by collective agency over time and \nspace. Our focus is not a description of agile behaviour or its precursors but on the performance of \ncollective agility that embodies the LCG project. The emphasis is on agility\u2019s emergence from \ndisparate practices embedded in the organisational and cultural context. In simpler terms, it is not just \nthat agile system development can be sustained in particular supportive organisational or cultural \ncontexts, but that a context or culture may itself demand (at times) and create a certain type of agile \nperformance.  \nOrganisational Improvisation and Paradoxes \nTo unpack the complexities of collective agility as an organisational performance, we draw upon the \nliterature of organisational improvisation (Cunha et al., 1999; Weick, 1998) with a focus on collective, \ncollaborative and coordinated improvisational activity. Improvisation is essentially an individual or \nsmall group practice, immediate and situated, whereas the agility we study is that which emerges from \na collective performance - an organisational improvisation. This literature is reviewed and organised \nfrom the perspective of paradox (Mirvis 1998). It has been frequently noted that innovations such as \nshort cycle time development or agile methods involve tensions and paradoxical elements, for \nexample, learning to \u201cplan not to plan\u201d (Baskerville, 2006) or to achieve a \u201cdisciplined messiness\u201d \n(Highsmith, 2002) and Baskerville\u2019s (2006) calls for a rejection of polar distinctions between concepts \nlike planning and serendipity, or discipline and creativity. The concept of paradox is not intended to \nsuggest logical impossibility or irresolvable conflict; rather paradox provides a means of presenting \nand analysing productive tensions, dynamics, and motivating challenges of systems development. In \nconstructing a set of improvisation-paradoxes and applying them in the analysis, we reveal the \n  5 \nembracing and balancing of such paradoxical elements as a key to understanding agility within \ndistributed collaborative system development.  \nIn summary, this paper introduces collective agility, a concept developed from a paradoxical \nperspective, to describe a particular genre of organisational performance. The rest of the paper is \norganised as follows. Section 2 further develops the conceptual constructs, i.e. the improvisation-\nparadoxes, from the literature of organisational improvisation. Research methodology and case \ndescription can be found in Sections 3 and 4. Section 5 presents an in-depth analysis of the case using \nthe improvisation-paradoxes, extended to discussions and implications in Section 6. Section 7 \nconcludes the article. \n2. Improvisation Paradoxes and Enacted Emergence \nExisting research on organisational improvisation mostly considers it as a creative group performance \nwith little formal planning and minimal central control, like a jazz performance (Barrett, 1998, Hatch, \n1999) or improvisational theatre (Crossan, 1998). Cunha et al (1999) define improvisation as \u201cthe \nconception of action as it unfolds, by an organisation and\/or its members, drawing on available \nmaterial, cognitive, affective and social resources\u201d. This definition emphasises two aspects. First, the \nconvergence in time of conception and execution (Moorman and Miner, 1998), or \u201creal-time \nplanning\u201d (Miner et al., 2001). This resonates strongly with the basic notion of agility as quickness, \nlightness, and nimbleness (Highsmith, 2002). Second, bricolage \u2013 the aspect of finding solutions from \navailable rather than optimal resources \u2013 which is often implied or used interchangeably with \nimprovisation (Weick 1993a, 1993b, Ciborra, 2002).  \nWithin the field of information systems, ideas of improvisation and bricolage have often been used to \ncritique the dominant ontology of planning and control and the pervasive normative tendencies that \nfollow (Ciborra, 1999, 2002, Lanzara, 1999, Orlikowski, 1996). Organisational improvisation \nliterature does not deny or negate the value of such concepts, but suggests that it is in the tension and \ninteraction between these and their opposites: structure and change, order and chaos, control and \nfreedom, that creative attitudes, innovative outcomes, and productive practices may be found. The \nperformative view of agility adopted here reveals the \u201ctensions and oppositions between well-founded, \nwell-reasoned, and well-supported alternative explanations of the same phenomenon\u201d (Poole and Van \nde Ven, 1989). Thus we draw on the established tradition of paradox as a dialectical device to examine \ncomplex situations and to build theory (Lewis, 2000; Poole and Van-de-Ven, 1989; Smith and \nTushman, 2005). Lewis (2000) describes three categories of paradoxes prevalent in organisational \nstudies \u2013 learning (old\/new), organising (control\/flexibility), and belonging (self\/other). We use these \nthree categories to synthesise the literature on organisational improvisation and propose a set of \nimprovisation-paradoxes. Table 1 presents the six constructed improvisation-paradoxes with examples \nof the concepts they are based on. These concepts are highlighted in italic in the following elaboration \n  6 \nof the improvisation-paradoxes. \n[Insert Table 1 about here] \nParadoxes of Learning \nParadoxes of learning arise from the tension between old and new, \u201cthe struggle between the comfort \nof the past and the uncertainty of the future\u201d, which are fundamental to processes of innovation, \ntransformation and sensemaking (Lewis, 2000). On this basis, we identify two pairs of paradoxes of \nlearning: Learned Improvisation, i.e. improvisation drawing on past experience and situated within \nenvironmental constraints; and Reflective Spontaneity, making sense by ex-post interpretation and \nrationalisation.  \n- Learned Improvisation: This paradox is related to the tension between the immediate (the here-\nand-now environment and context) and the historic (the understood, interpreted, documented and \nremembered past). \u201cLearning requires using, critiquing, and often destroying past understandings and \npractices to construct new and more complicated frames of references\u201d (Lewis, 2000). For example, \njazz musicians recall music that has been performed and learn from it (Berliner, 1994). Improvisation \nis often a response to task uncertainty, and environmental turbulence (Moorman and Miner, 1998). \nUnexpected and \u201cunplanned-for\u201d (Miner et al., 2001) occurrences or tasks can arise inside the \ncollective too (Cunha et al., 1999), for example, when task complexity seems to be beyond the scope \nof rational planning, accumulated knowledge or predetermined method (Hutchins, 1995). \nOrganisational improvisation can also be linked to deliberate innovation \u2013 for example, visions which \narticulate a gap between reality and possibility can induce actions which are partly planned yet \nsignificantly emergent (Mintzberg and McHugh, 1985) and improvised (Crossan et al., 1996).  \nTo cope with uncertainties and complexities of the environment, context or task, people need to draw \nupon a repertoire of organisational memories, \u201clearned ways of thinking and behaving\u201d (Moorman \nand Miner, 1998). The paradox of Learned Improvisation thus also reflects the tension between the \nreliance on \u201chabits of thought\u201d and routines (Hutchins, 1995, Weick and Roberts, 1993) and a will to \ndepart from organisational traditions and norms (Cunha et al., 1999) \u2013 to drop your tools (Weick, \n1993a). This balance is intricate, as successful improvisations are often based on accumulated \nknowledge and experience from extensive practicing in the past (Moorman and Miner, 1998). The \nconstruct of \u201chistory\u201d here is also related to collective understanding and organisational culture, e.g. in \nour case, the experimental culture of particle physics. \n- Reflective Spontaneity: \u201cReflective spontaneity\u201d is a paradox expressing ad hoc experimentation \n(spontaneity) and post hoc recovering of rationalisation by the collective, Weick\u2019s retrospective \nsensemaking (Weick, 1993a). Improvisers often have no choice but to engage with the situation with \nno time for thorough reflection, and the significance of the action is often only (re)discovered after the \n  7 \nevent. As Weick (1998) suggests, \u201cto improve memory is to gain retrospective access to a greater \nrange of resources\u201d. Retrospective sensemaking (Weick, 1993a) can thus provide order, purpose, and \ncoherence (Barrett, 1998) to practices of trial-and-error or bricolage (Lanzara, 1999). Meaning can \narise from ex-post interpretation and sensemaking by a number of dispersed agents, rather than from \nex ante planning and implementation by a central designer (ibid.). Such sensemaking can be facilitated \nby transient constructs (ibid), such as \u201cmakeshift artefacts, recombinant routines \u2026 ephemeral \norganisations, disposable symbols, fugitive meanings\u201d than can sustain some continuity and stability. \nMilestones and deadlines, for example, may serve these purposes. Thus, at the macro-level, an \nunfolding improvisational performance and the reflections on it, give rise to an emergent order (Miner \net al., 2001) which in turn can be drawn upon by others (Orlikowski, 2000).  \nParadoxes of Organising \nParadoxes of organising reflect tensions between control and flexibility (Lewis, 2000), formal and \ninformal, integration and differentiation (Chae and Bloodgood, 2006), denoting \u201can ongoing process \nof equilibrating opposing forces that encourage commitment, trust, and creativity while maintaining \nefficiency, discipline, and order\u201d (Lewis, 2000). Two paradoxes from the literature are summarised \nhere as Planned Agility and Structured Chaos. The former underlines the tension between the \ndeliberate action of planning and the uncontrolled processes of drifting and unfolding; the latter refers \nto the tension between chaotic day-to-day practices and minimal structures. \n- Planned Agility: As Weick (1998) puts it, \u201cimprovisation is a mixture of the pre-composed and the \nspontaneous\u201d. Miner et al. (2001) suggests that organisations can plan to improvise and routinise \nprocesses to stimulate improvisation, without the actual content of the improvisation being planned in \nadvance. This is related to what Baskerville (2006) refers to as artful planning. Degrees of planning \nfor improvisation encompasses two aspects; clearly articulated goals (Barrett, 1998; Crossan et al., \n1996; Orlikowski, 1996), and milestones and action deadlines (Cunha et al., 1999). Clearly articulated \ngoals can provide a sense of direction and shared vision, often operating via culture or ideology \n(Mintzberg, 1995; Weick, 1993b), and serve as a \u2018magnetic field\u2019 which, without prescribing \nindividual action, is strongly normative in shaping such action (Cunha et al., 1999). Short-term \nmilestones and deadlines build a sense of momentum and urgency (e.g. Crossan, 1998; Hutchins, \n1991; Mirvis, 1998) and sustain a \u201cstate of flow\u201d (Hatch, 1999). They provide opportunities to keep \ntrack of the variations between dispersed innovative actions and priorities within the collective goal. In \nother words, even though day-to-day practices may be unplanned, ad hoc, and drifting (Ciborra et al., \n2000), minimal strategic planning and management can ensure that this is oriented towards the goal.  \n- Structured Chaos: Organisational improvisation might be seen as a form of \u201corganised anarchy\u201d \ncharacterised by problematic preferences, unclear technology, and fractured participation (Hutchins, \n1991, Cohen et al., 1972). Cunha et al (1999) suggest \u201cminimal structure\u201d to express the controls \n  8 \ndesired to achieve improvisations that progress (Crossan, 1998; Orlikowski, 1996; Weick, 1998). \nMinimal structure refers to a shared sense of rules, norms and identity among members of a \ncommunity of practice (Brown and Duguid, 1991), and which can be drawn upon by members to \nmediate their knowing-in-practice (Orlikowski, 2000), yet allow them to depart from canonical \npractices and initiate changes. A collateral structure provides non-intrusive support to learning \ncommunities allowing space for fluid and interpretative practices to take place across boundaries of \ngroups (Cunha et al., 1999).  \nMinimal and collateral structures allow the cultivation of an experimental culture (Cunha et al., 1999) \nor pro-innovation culture (Miner et al., 2001; Mirvis, 1998; Weick, 1998), which nurture individuality \nthrough features such as tolerance to error (Barrett, 1998; Crossan, 1998; Hatch, 1999). Weick \nproposes an \u201caesthetic of imperfection\u201d as an important condition for improvisation, based on an \n\u201cestimate of the degree of organisation and form that could have been extracted retrospectively from \nthe materials at hand, given that they were generated by a fallible human being acting publicly under \ntime pressure, with fallible tools\u201d (1999). Lanzara (1999) similarly talks of fractures, discontinuities, \ninconsistencies, deviations from current routines and puzzling or random behaviours in innovative \nprocesses. Yet imperfection and murkiness can embody evolutionary opportunities for novel practices \nand forms, and lead to further productive combinations and transformations.  \nParadoxes of Belonging \nParadoxes of belonging emerge \u201cbecause actors strive for both self-expression and collective \naffiliation\u201d (Lewis, 2000). This tension is particularly distinctive in improvisational activity, because \nby nature members of an improvisational collective tend to be self-driven, intelligent and creative \npeople, yet they also have an acute appreciation that success relies on collaborative effort. It is through \ntrust and mutual support that they acquire confidence and strength in face of pressure and challenges. \nWe adopt under this category Mirvis\u2019 (1998) Collective Individuality and Anxious Confidence, \nenriching them by linking them to organisational improvisation literature and theory. \n- Collective individuality: Creativity and individual skills (Barrett, 1998; Hatch, 1999; Kamoche et \nal., 2003) may be encouraged and supported, but individual freedom is inevitably bound by a level of \ngroup cohesion in order to achieve a collective goal, especially when task complexity is beyond the \ncognitive capacity of any individual (Hutchins, 1995; Weick and Roberts, 1993). As Weick (1998) \nputs it, \u201cdiscussions of improvisation in groups are built on images of call and response, give and take, \ntransitions, exchange, complementing, negotiating a shared sense of the beat, offering harmonic \npossibilities to someone else, preserving continuity of mood, and cross-fertilisation\u201d. Facilitative \nleadership (Barrett, 1998; Crossan, 1998), trust (Crossan, 1998; Weick, 1993a), and fluid \ncommunication (Miner et al., 2001; Orlikowski, 1996) nurture group performance. Such emotional ties \ndo not have to stem from self-disclosed intimacy but from shared actions, \u201changing out\u201d and a sense of \n  9 \nmembership in the collective (Barrett, 1998).  \n- Anxious confidence: Emotional ties also serve to provide a \u201csafety-net\u201d for members of a collective \nto cope with anxiety, or to deal with the affective element in their performance (Cunha et al., 1999). \nCiborra (2001) considers improvisation itself as a mood and contrasts it with conventional moods of \nthe systems development context such as panic or boredom, both of which fog vision and conceal \npossibilities for action. Mirvis (1998) suggests \u201canxious confidence\u201d as the means to live with the \nambiguity, complexity, and challenges of working in an improvisational collective. Similarly, LaPorte \n(1996) (cited by Weick et al., 1999) speaks of \u2018prideful wariness\u2019 when discussing air traffic \ncontrollers. While Mirvis focuses mostly on individual capability and confidence, confidence is not \nonly experienced through individual knowledge and skills (Hutchins, 1991; Moorman and Miner, \n1998; Orlikowski, 1996) but also in aspects of organisational cultures, such as a history of innovation \nand \u201caesthetics of imperfection\u201d (Weick, 1999), which can be drawn upon as \u201clearned ways of \nthinking and behaving\u201d (Moorman and Miner, 1998). \nParadoxes and Enacted Emergence \nThe improvisation paradoxes explored above embody a sense of tensions found in an agile \nperformance, particularly in a distributed context. To capture the dynamic duality we adopt two of \nPoole and Van de Ven\u2019s (1989) four modes of working with paradoxes \u2013 to first accept the paradox \nand use them constructively, and then introduce a new term or concept to resolve the paradox. In this \nspirit we propose the term \u201cenacted emergence\u201d to portray a paradoxical and agile performance that is \nboth constructive and emergent.  \nIndeed, it is often pointed out that information systems development is an emergent socio-technical \nactivity (Baskerville and Pries-Heje, 2004; Chae and Poole, 2005; Orlikowski, 1996; Truex and \nBaskerville, 1998). The improvisation-paradoxes developed here juxtapose and reveal the seemingly \nopposite elements of such improvisation, and can reveal the tension between environment and history, \nspontaneity and reflexivity, unfolding and planning, practices and structure, individual and collective, \nand anxiety and confidence. These elements are bound together in a constant mutual constitution. \nEnacting elements on one side of Table 1 give rise to elements on the other side, for example, high \nlevel planning, direction, and minimal structure provides the support, freedom and safety-net for \npeople to explore through trial-and-error, improvise, and innovate. Seen the other way, seemingly \ndisorderly and chaotic day-to-day practices can produce order, direction and meaning through \nretrospective sensemaking. Individuals encouraged to embrace their individuality and thinking free \ncultivate a culture of democratic meritocracy, while a high level of creativity and competence, as well \nas common goals can inspire trust, commitment and voluntarism.  \nCollective agility is then a phenomenon of enacted emergence in the sense that, while rooted in \ncreative human agency, i.e. the improvisational practices (including the dimensions of planning, \n  10 \norganising and structuring) of knowledgeable and reflective social actors (individuals and teams), \nagility is an attribute of the distributed collective that emerges from the paradoxes and exists as a \ncombination of intended and unintended consequences of these activity. In the following sections, we \nexamine in detail how the particle physics community enact these improvisation-paradoxes and sustain \na level of collective agility. \n3. Research Methodology \nThe Large Hadron Collider Computing Grid (LCG) provides a distinctive case of distributed systems \ndevelopment (Venters and Cornford, 2006). This work focuses on the UK\u2019s component of the project \n\u2013 GridPP. Core data collection took place from 2006 to 2008 and included participant observations of \nweekly meetings, various UK and international GridPP workshops and meetings, and relevant \nconferences. We had full access to the GridPP main documentation, and subscribed to its main mailing \nlists. \nForty eight semi-structured qualitative interviews of between one and one and a half hours were \nundertaken at universities across the UK and at CERN in Geneva. Table 2 provides details of the \nresearch activities undertaken while Table 3 shows a summary of the principal interviewees. Sampling \nwas based on functional groups of GridPP, starting from the Project Management Board (PMB) for an \noverview, then proceeding to representatives from the three main activity areas: applications, \nmiddleware and infrastructure. Another group of interviewees were users from the LHC experiments, \nmany of whom were involved in some development activities. We interviewed managers and technical \nexperts of the LCG at CERN to contextualise our observations. This showed that the practices of \nGridPP were not unique to the UK but have roots in an international Particle Physicist culture. When \nnecessary, interviewees were revisited. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and coded for \nanalysis using the Atlas.Ti software, though not rigidly so as to avoid being restricted by the software. \nData analysis was closely integrated with theoretical development in an iterative process, one feeding \ninto the other.  \n[Insert Table 2 about here] \n[Insert Table 3 about here] \nWe identify three stages of data analysis. The first was open coding of the data, labelling aspects of the \nproject, practices, and emerging ideas (Table 4 shows an example). This exercise, combined with the \nembedded understanding acquired by the researchers from secondary material and during participant \nobservation, provided an appreciation of the complexity of the project and gave a sense of the tensions \ninherent in such work. For example, experimental physicists were not always keen to follow \nprocedures. Similarly, while there might seem to be prevalent adhocracy and frequent fire-fighting, the \nproject was unified in their confidence that the system would work. With these broad ideas in mind, \n  11 \nour theoretical exploration led us to the literature of organisational improvisation, which has a strong \nresonance with the data, and already entails a paradoxical dimension (Weick, 1998). This process \ngives rise to a draft analytical framework of improvisation-paradoxes. \n[Insert Table 4 about here] \nIn the second round of data analysis, we used the conceptual constructs of the improvisation-\nparadoxes as categories to set up and iteratively refine code families in a way similar to axial coding in \ngrounded theory (Corbin and Strauss, 2008). These codes were presented in a network view, and \nrelationships between the codes were identified. But relationships were not understood as indicating \ncausality. These \u201cnetworks\u201d were verified and modified against further observations and interviews. \nThis was an iterative process until the key conceptual constructs were sufficiently refined and \nsaturated. We verified our findings with a survey, not reported here, which largely confirmed the \nthemes.  \nIn summary, the analysis reported here is the result of iterative reflections and ongoing discussions \nwithin the research team and with GridPP members, rather than a narrow machine-derived account \u2013 \nour own engagement with organisational improvisation and sensemaking. While all the quotes given \nhere are taken from interview transcripts, the ideas have also been significantly reinforced by informal \nconversations and participant observations. \nThis is not to say that the GridPP community is unified in their opinions. Tensions, conflicts and \ndifferent views are inevitable in any undertaking of this scale. Nevertheless, the research attempts to \ncapture the distinctive features of GridPP, and this account has been broadly supported by three \nGridPP PMB members who were presented with the key findings of this paper.  \n4. The Particle Physics Grid  \nIn April 2010 the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) particle accelerator at CERN, the European \nLaboratory for Particle Physics, started again after a problematic public launch in 2009. The LHC \ncollides Hadron particles at energies close to those of the Big Bang in a search for the elusive \u2018Higgs-\nBoson\u2019 particle believed to be responsible for matter having mass. These collisions will produce data \nfor the four LHC experiments. Since the Higgs-Boson is conjectured to be extremely difficult to find -\nlikened to searching for a \u201cneedle in twenty million haystacks\u201d, the number of collisions, and the \nsubsequent data produced, is vast. The LHC envisages producing 15 million gigabytes of data a year - \nequivalent to a DVD every 15 seconds or 1% of 2006 global information production (Lee et al., 2006). \nTo store and analyse this data the LHC requires the equivalent of 100,000 PCs spread across the globe \nand working as a Grid (Britton et al., 2004).  \nA grid from a technical perspective is a computing platform for coordinated resource sharing and \n  12 \nproblem solving suitable in data-intensive and compute-intensive applications (Foster et al., 2001). A \ngrid connects and coordinates diverse distributed and heterogeneous computing resources, presenting \nitself to users as though it was a single resource.  \n[Insert Figure 1 about here] \nThe GridPP project started in 2001 and has two main activities: developing software to allow users to \nsubmit computing jobs to the LCG, and developing and operating the UK\u2019s component of LCG. \nGridPP is involved in developing applications and middleware (the grid's \u2018operating system\u2019) as well \nas providing technical infrastructure including storage and processing units. As shown in Figure 1, the \nLCG has a hierarchically tiered structure, with Tier 0 at CERN, Tier 1s consisting of the national IT \ncentres in each of the major countries involved in the project, and Tier 2s being the regional centres in \neach country. GridPP consists of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) as the Tier 1 centre, and \nfour Tier 2 centres, each coordinating a number of institutes in their region. \n[Insert Figure 2 about here] \nGridPP is managed, as with the wider LCG, by what one interviewee described as a \u201cdemocratic \nmeritocracy\u201d. Figure 2 shows GridPP\u2019s management structure which is best described as a network \nthan any sort of hierarchy. The PMB is the heart of the network coordinating the project. It provides \nquarterly reports to the Collaboration Board which consists of representatives from the 19 institutes. \nThe participating institutes enter the collaboration not under any legal obligation, but bound by a \nMemorandum of Understanding which specifies the amount of resources and the level of service that \neach site is expected to provide, and the funding and support they will receive from GridPP in return. \nThis document serves as a \u201cgentlemen\u2019s agreement\u201d and there are no formal lines of authority between \nGridPP and the member institutes other than this collaborative relationship. Decisions are made on a \ndemocratic or consensual basis and implemented by influence and persuasion.  \nDeveloping LCG has been seen from the start as a highly distributed, complex and poorly defined \nsystems development challenge. Cutting edge hardware and software is used, new software standards \nhave to be negotiated, and middleware along with a wide range of supporting software, developed in a \nrange of countries and programming languages. LCG is developed with close involvement of members \nof the user community who exerts strong influence and pressure for the completion of a working \nsystem, which has to be achieved with limited time and resources.  \nThe system development practices used within GridPP broadly coincide with the general principles of \nagile methods; \u201cindividuals and interactions over processes and tools; working software over \ncomprehensive documentation; customer collaboration over contract negotiation; and responding to \nchange over following a plan\u201d (Fowler and Highsmith, 2001). A technical expert with experience of \nGridPP described it as a \u201cbottom-up approach\u201d.  \n  13 \nThe systems development practices observed in this case are similar to those described by Baskerville \nand Pries-Heje (2004) as \u201cshort cycle time systems development\u201d. Table 5 compares similarities and \ndifferences between the practices observed in the two studies. The final column of the table indicates \nunderlying organisational implications related to the identified practices. Beyond these similarities \nwith other agile or short-cycle development projects, some challenges and characteristics of LCG and \nGridPP are distinctive, in particular, the scale of the system and the distributed nature of its own \nenvironment raises demands for scalability and interoperability. For example, LCG draws on several \nregional grids in Europe, North America and Scandinavia each using different middleware stacks. \nWithin the European project, the middleware is modularised and its components developed in a \nvariety of programming languages. Middleware releases are tested in small-scale pre-production \nsystems but they tend to be problematic when implemented across the whole system. The Grid \ntherefore evolves as advanced users actively engage in using, testing and reporting problems. System \ndevelopment cycles are not only simultaneous or overlapping activities of development, testing and \nuse, but also include complete parallel solutions which compete with each other. Finally, there are \ntensions around whether the Grid should be generic enough for other communities of users (which it is \nin part funded to be), or whether it should be tailored to particle physics (the main users and \ndevelopers); and tensions between the powers of system administrators of local sites, who might wish \nto prioritise the needs of their local institute, and the requirements of the LHC experiments. \n[Insert Table 5 about here] \n5. Enacting Paradoxes \nThe enactment perspective proposed by Weick (1977) suggests that organisations \u201cconstruct\u201d their \nenvironment before they \u201crespond\u201d to it or try to control it, and this can be understood as a process of \ninteracting and sensemaking. Enactment embodies this sense of action and of creation. In this case, the \nparticle physicists \u201creconstruct\u201d the task of building a new distributed technology as one that they are \nlargely familiar with \u2013 a distributed experimental collaboration \u2013 and it is seen as just another task that \nthey have to complete in order to achieve the shared goal \u2013 doing new physics.  \nAs introduced above, we frame the systems development activity in GridPP as an organisational \nimprovisation that is animated by various tensions. We present our analysis, drawing on \nimprovisation-paradoxes but in a slightly different sequence to Lewis. In this case we see the nature of \nthe grid development as being fundamentally driven by a sense of belonging and start with this \nconcept. We then move to paradoxes of organising and conclude with learning. \n5.1 Belonging to GridPP \nThere is a sense of a strong community bond among GridPP members, which we express in the \nconcept of collective individuality (Table 1 & 6). Most members of GridPP are particle physicists or \n  14 \nhave a physics background. One consequence is that members are motivated by both a shared history \nand a shared goal. This goal is not to build a grid, but to discover new physics. They work for the same \nvision despite strong competition between similar experiments. As commented by one interviewee,  \n\u201cI said I was proud of being a particle physicist, this is because particle physicists always get \nthe job done; by and large because they are driven by one fundamental thing. They want their \nexperiment to work when the beam gets into the accelerator, okay? And that transcends \neverything else they do. \u201d  \nCoupled with the shared goal is a high level of trust as shown very clearly from the interviews:  \n\u201cEveryone trusts each other to be doing the best they can\u2026 That fundamental trust drives our \nparticle physics group. \u201d  \n\u201cYou have to trust that people will step up\u2026 and do the dirty work as well as doing the \nglamorous work.\u201d \nParticle physicists have been encultured above all to respect intellectual capacity (Traweek, 1988). \nWith a high level of trust, people generally enjoy a high level of autonomy at work, usually without \nclear instructions or strict supervision. Individuals will try to solve a problem, develop software, write \na document, not because their line manager told them to, but because they felt that it was something \nuseful to do. Individuals are driven by individual motivations \u2013 but they also desire that their \ncontribution be recognised as valuable. Key technologies in particle physics have emerged in this \nmanner \u2013 with the main analysis system for storing particle physics events (called \u201cRoot\u201d) began with \none developer trying to solve a problem in a new way without institutional support, similar to their \ndevelopment of the Web. As one senior CERN employee who shared an office with Tim Berners-Lee \nrecounted:  \n\u201cTim had the freedom from this hierarchy, to spend a bit of time investigating something \nwhich was of interest to him and nobody else here said \u2013 \u2018oh it\u2019s a waste of time, never mind\u2019. \nHe was working on remote procedure calls, and out of it popped the web\u201d. \nWith members based in disparate institutes, it is important to develop social and emotional bonds \namong individual members. The deployment team provides a good example.  \n\u201cWe have to work very well together as a team, in order for GridPP to be successful. And \u2026 \nit's quite a complicated structure - there are multiple channels of communication, some of \nwhich are duplicated some of which are contradictory, and there are all sorts of ways in \nwhich information flows. And anything that you can do to oil the cogs of the machine is going \nto help. ... And I think for us to socialise together is a very important thing.\u201d  \n\u201cGoing to the pub\u201d when and wherever they meet is one aspect of this since it \u201cfosters a bond\u201d \nbetween people and allows them to discuss their frustrations caused by the size and complexity of the \nproject. During such social occasions work is invariably discussed, people \u201clet off steam\u201d and \n  15 \nnegotiations are made. These social meetings are sporadic and between them the constant \ncommunication through video conferencing, email, messaging lists, blogs and instant messaging \ncontinue. Relationships develop between parties who have never met. Many attend the regular video-\nconference meetings simply to get a feel for the \u201cmood\u201d and a sense of connection \u2013 often having the \nmeeting running on their computer while undertaking other tasks. \nCommunication supports a mood of anxious confidence (Tables 1 & 6), that mediates the pressure of \nthe LHC switch-on and of showing the UK in a good light among the worldwide particle physics \ncommunity. Along the way GridPP has to face many unplanned-for occurrences and environmental \nturbulence in funding, human resources, external and internal technological changes, hardware and \nsoftware configurations, technical requirements from the experiments, computer market conditions, \nand other institutional and political factors. Indeed, the project is \u201ccommitted to something that it isn\u2019t \nquite funded\u201d (PMB member) and in March 2007 were allocated only 70% of the anticipated funding \nfor Phase 3 (2007 to 2011), which resulted in support posts being cut. Nevertheless, the collaboration \nremains committed, engaged, and always \u201cjust about\u201d on top of things. They may appear to be \nconstantly fire-fighting, discovering problems, managing crises, and negotiating solutions. But almost \neverybody in the collaboration who we interviewed held a firm belief that the Grid will work; maybe \nnot perfectly, but it will work.  \nA significant source of their confidence thus resides in a belief in the individual skill, competence and \npragmatic creativity of physicists, as well as high energy physics\u2019 formative context of collaboration. \nWhile GridPP employs people from other fields, the majority come from this \u201celite science\u201d (Traweek, \n1988) which is highly competitive to enter. When asked about the likely success of LCG, a technical \ncoordinator boils it down to cleverness:  \n\u201c\u2026because we are very clever people, we have a very clear and determined goal, we will \nmake it work\u201d.  \nAnother source of confidence resides in the community\u2019s long history of success in computing. CERN \nfor example accepted the problems of working with pre-production supercomputers from the days of \nthe CDC 6600 through to the CRAY X-MP (Jones, 2004). Later they pioneered work on the Web \n(Berners-Lee and Fischetti, 1997), shifted early to use Open-source (Linux) server-farms, all driven by \nthe need to do physics. Grid computing, it seems, is just another minor computing waypoint on the \nroute to the truth about the universe. Equally importantly, the particle physics community enjoys an \norganisational culture which appreciates \u201cthe aesthetic of imperfection\u201d (Weick, 1999) and accepts \nfailed attempts as part of a bigger process, fostering the confidence of individual innovators.  \n5.2 Organising GridPP \nPlanned agility (Table 1 & 7) refers to planning to improvise and preparing for change. In GridPP it is \nrecognised that ad hoc practices have to be supported by some financial planning, risk management, \nproject milestones and resource allocation mechanisms. For this reason extensive Gantt charts and \nschedules are produced, often in a preparation for research funding council reviews, but also serving \nas a minimal structure for the project. While a project manager was only appointed on the insistence of \nan IT industry representative sitting on the Oversight Committee, and the PMB finally settled on \nappointing a particle physicist (and \u201cfriend\u201d of GridPP) to the post, this role is now accepted as crucial \n  16 \nto keeping the project on track. This is not however to say that the PM role focuses on traditional \nproject management. Considering GridPP as in its essence \u201cexperimental\u201d and undertaking \u201cgreen-\nfield research\u201d, the PMB focuses on supporting and justifying change as at the core of their minimal \nplanning process.  \n\u201cWe wanted to establish the fact that we had the right to change our deliverables. So we set \nup this project map and we set up the formality of change forms. So this was to formalise our \nfreedom to change the project \u2026 yes, we had a set of milestones but you know, we had a \nmechanism to change them because we have to be responsive. \u201d  \nAlthough schedules are constantly in flux, the project seeks never to lose sight of where they are and \nwhere they are heading.  \n\u201c\u2026people are looking at the overall targets of where people are trying to get to, rather than \nmonitoring people on a daily or weekly basis. So we're looking for overall trends more than \nvery small time-based ones.\u201d  \nThe project maps and schedules, change forms, and quarterly reports are tools designed to achieve \nvarious paradoxical goals; to display rationalised order, to acquire legitimacy, to cope with changes \nand to support or legitimise spontaneity. They also provide impetus to carry the project forward, even \nif the plan is tentative and has to be made real through day-to-day sense-making and actions. This \nproactive mode of management is combined with a reactive mode of daily trouble-shooting: \n\u201cWe do everything we can in terms of advanced planning, so we have a staggered \nprogramme of sites in migrating, things like this. But ultimately what dominates is when we \nhave done something that has gone wrong, or something has broken, or something doesn\u2019t \nwork in experiments, or something like this, and we have to try and solve that.\u201d \nIn other words, there is a plan to improvise, routinised processes to stimulate improvisation and \nobservation of their own improvisational activities (Miner et al., 2001). As one of the technical \ncoordinators described, with an extended metaphor, \n\u201cYou need your head in the clouds to see the big picture, but you very much need your feet on \nthe ground because you have to put one foot in front of the other, and day to day we keep \nputting one foot in front of the other\u2026.\u201d  \nStructured chaos (Tables 1 & 7) means providing a minimal structure to support improvisation. \nGridPP is a collaboration of institutes who work together under a Memorandum of Understanding. \nManagement in GridPP does not rely on vertical lines of command, and while there is an extensive \nstructure of management boards, committees, and technical groups, they serve more as communication \nchannels than hierarchies of authority. Managerial roles in the collaboration serve most of the time as \nrepresentatives, spokesperson, or coordinating facilitators, and when decisions (e.g. financial \nplanning) have to be made centrally at the PMB, such decisions are open to scrutiny by the full \ncollaboration. Most importantly, there is enormous respect to the technical knowledge at the grass-root \nlevel. As one previous group leader stated:  \n\u201cThere\u2019s no strict hierarchy [\u2026] the group leader doesn\u2019t get to say what to do.\u2026 We \n  17 \nrecognise it\u2019s the younger people that are much smarter and they\u2019re going to be making the \npapers \u2026 So it\u2019s kind of a federation, club\u2026 of smart academics who all want to do it and \neveryone trusts each other to be doing the best they can for the experiment. And that \nfundamental trust drives our particle physics group.\u201d  \nDifferent solutions often compete with each other within the collaboration for a while until one of \nthem wins by forming more alliances or others die in a natural course e.g. due to technical failures, \nlow up-take, lack of funding or other circumstances. The technical systems then emerge from \n\u201ccontests of unfolding\u201d (Knorr-Cetina, 1999): \n\u201cThe cream comes to the top. Things that work win out and that\u2019s how we worked it. (\u2026) \nNobody knew what the right approach was so you try several approaches and some win, some \nlose.\u201d   \nThe \u201cnatural selection\u201d of technical solutions, as described by members of GridPP, allows elements of \nthe Grid to emerge from dispersed and localised practices without an arbitrary or centrally imposed \ndecision-making process. Although the middleware is developed by a European Grid development \nproject (EGEE) centrally coordinated at CERN, it is modularised and each of the components is \nprototyped, released, deployed, tested, and improved in an evolutionary manner. Beyond this core \nsoftware there are often parallel technical solutions found in the project, such as some components of \nthe middleware, or other software packages developed locally to help deploy, monitor, or manage \naspects of the Grid. The Grid environment thus consists of a mixture of \u201cecosystems\u201d, in which \nmultiple technical solutions co-exist and even compete. Political influence and vested interests are \nreflected in such competition, but do not dictate outcomes. This is not to say that politics does not \nexist, but it is dispersed and mediated, and the influence of powerful actors is often dissipated, or \ncontingent on sound technical judgment. As an interviewee commented  \n\u201cNobody, no matter, even if they were the most politically powerful person in EGEE, can \nforce a broken piece of software to be deployed, because they will lose their political influence \nif they do that.\u201d \n5.3 Learning to perform \nLearned improvisation (Tables 1 & 8) refers to drawing upon past experience to cope with \nuncertainties and complexity of the present. The need to improvise in LCG stems from the innovative \nand exploratory nature of the task: the process has to be trial-and-error since nobody knows what \nexactly the end product will look like or what issues will emerge along the way. Moreover, the \ncomplexity, scale and distribution of the project means no one person can have a clear idea of the \nwhole system (Hutchins, 1991); requirements cannot be pre-specified in detail; architectures are \nconjectures, and even the one centrally designed piece of technology, the middleware, has to be \nmodularised and released gradually rather than in a big-bang manner.  \nReliance on externally produced hardware and software also creates challenges by, exposing external \ntechnological perturbations. Relying on the EGEE to provide the middleware, GridPP face an ongoing \nprocess of learning and adapting to immature software, and making it work at each individual site. For \n  18 \nexample an undocumented change in the firmware of a set of hard-disks included an error that had \nsignificant repercussions for GridPP as they struggled to isolate this irregular error among terabytes of \ndistributed storage. Similarly the release of a new version of the Scientific Linux operating system (on \nwhich LCG runs) created demands from some computer centres to upgrade GridPP to this new version \nparticularly where computing resources were shared with other disciplines. Yet EGEE\u2019s software only \nran on an even earlier version. Further issues occurred when some centres purchased 64bit rather than \n32bit systems, requiring two different distributions of the software.  \nThe response to this of those involved is not to control, predict or formalise, but rather to respond \npragmatically and creatively at the time, drawing on the down-to-earth and creative approaches \nembedded in particle physics tradition (Lewis, 2000). As Dahlbom and Mathiassen (1993) describe, \ndevelopers \u201chave to interact with the environment, accept the openness of the problem and the system \nto be developed, take into account the preferences and beliefs of problem owners and users, deal with \nthe economical and political climate of the project, and keep in step with the changes in the kind of \ntechnologies on which the project is dependent\u201d. Developers should be \u201cscientific investigators\u201d rather \nthan \u201ceconomic agents\u201d (ibid.). Indeed, particle physicists clearly bring their identity as \u201cscientific \ninvestigators\u201d into computing.  \n\u201cI think the people who come from a physics background are ultimately more pragmatic in \ncomputing. They see the computing as a tool to get a job done. And if it requires you to wrap \nsellotape around it to get it to work, then they will wrap sellotape around it\u2026 the physicists \nare happier with an ad hoc solution just to get the job done and push them through.\u201d  \nOne of the resources that GridPP draws upon is their identity as physicists, and as noted the \ncollaboration is designed as a physics experiment. The tradition of large scale globally distributed \ncollaborations (the ATLAS experiment, one of four at the LHC, has over two thousand members) and \nworking on a distributed basis is well established and provides a solid basis for improvisation in the \nGrid development project. Such collaborations include students, technicians, engineers and physicists. \nYet they have learnt at project management level how to organise collaborations to be pragmatic and \ndrive towards solutions. In other words, the ability to improvise is the result of years of experience and \nlearning. Such improvisation itself constitutes a further process of exploration and reflection which \nfeeds into the organisational capability to improvise.  \nReflexive spontaneity (Tables 1 & 8) indicates recovering meaning from improvisation retrospectively. \nThe seemingly spontaneous practices at the low level are balanced by a level of reflexivity maintained \nby continuous and extensive communication flows. Particle physics collaborations are managed by \nwhat Knorr-Cetina (1999) refers to as \u201ca fine grid of discourse\u201d, channelling individual knowledge \ninto the collaboration and providing it with a sort of \u201cdistributed cognition\u201d. This web of \ncommunication includes a complex structure of boards, committees, and working groups which \nregularly hold meetings including online virtual meeting. For example, the PMB meeting takes place \n  19 \nonline every Monday where they discuss the status of the project and make action plans. The \nDeployment Team meets online on Tuesdays where they discuss technical issues. There are many \nother meetings taking place virtually or face-to-face during the week. Wikis, web pages and blogs are \nconsultation points during the meetings. More importantly, members of GridPP subscribe to various \nmailing lists that carry constant exchanges of up-to-date information on problems and emerging \nsolutions.  \nSuch extensive communications embody both mutual monitoring and proactive sensemaking. It lies \nwithin the monitoring, accounting, and making sense of the behaviour and performance of the system. \nTargets of service levels and regular data transfer exercises test the reliability and robustness of the \nsystems hardware and software. Much GridPP discussions in meetings revolve around the results of \nsuch tests and monitoring statistics. Interpreting the statistics is not straightforward or free of \ncontroversy. One often hears remarks like \u201cwe have to understand what is causing this phenomenon\u201d \nor \u201cfind out what is behind the data\u201d. In other words, retrospective sensemaking is an inherent and \nnatural component in their process of system development. There is a \u201chumming\u201d of the collaboration, \ntalking \u201cwith itself, about itself\u201d (Knorr-Cetina, 1999), which maintains a constant collective \nreflexivity, as \u201cthe monitored character of the ongoing flow of social life\u201d (Giddens, 1984).  \n6. Discussions and Implications \nWe examine above the characteristics of the collaborative performance of GridPP that enable them to \nachieve distributed and scaled agility. Improvisation-paradoxes have been used to make sense of the \nway that the Grid is developed. In this section we reflect on the case material, draw implications for \nthe wider discourse of agile systems development and provide some suggestions for those engaged in \nother distributed systems developments. \nWith multiple objectives and system development rationales in the community, the construction of \nGrid technology is a constant engagement and negotiation between a structured process and \namethodical practices (Truex et al., 2000). Long term goals, shared aims, preset deliverables, regular \nmonitoring and proactive political legitimisation are entangled with an \u201cunfolding ontology\u201d (Knorr-\nCetina, 1999), elements of which include: pragmatic outlook, fragmented and ad hoc practices, \nbricolage and improvised solutions, post hoc rationalisation, as well as contested interests, internal \ncompetitions, and democratic decision making - \u201ca dialectic of resistance and accommodation\u201d \n(Benson, 1977, Pickering, 1995).  \nThe particle physicists, while not strictly following any pre-defined agile methods are aware of the \nchallenges they face and have made deliberate and substantial effort to achieve a suitable development \nprocess. In other words, the agility seen here is not just an unintended consequence of loose coupling, \na culture of improvisation and bricolage, intelligence, trust and pragmatism. Rather it is a performance \nby knowledgeable actors who draw upon and enact certain properties of the distributed collaboration, \n  20 \nsuch as minimal structure, flexible planning, extensive communication and social bonding, all serving \nto generate coherence, facilitate mutual understanding, promote sensemaking, and to coordinate \ndistributed work. The agency and knowledgeability of members of the project are central in this \nprocess. While no one serves as the mastermind of the project, the interaction and coordination among \nthem give rise to a \u201ccollective mindfulness\u201d (Carlo et al., 2004) with \u201ca rich awareness of \ndiscriminatory detail and a capacity for action\u201d (Weick et al., 1999). It takes real effort to maintain this \ncollective mindfulness, without which distributed agility would not be possible or sustainable. \nTherefore, while agility can be described as an emergent property of the distributed collaboration, such \nemergence is very much enacted, involving degrees of deliberation and reflection, and instantiated in \nday-to-day practices.  \nWhat implications should we draw from our analysis of this case of \u201ccollective agility\u201d? What is \npresented may not be an ideal form of distributed agile systems development \u2013 after all it is not in a \ncommercial environment or facing immediate safety critical concerns such as in health care or air \ntraffic control. Yet there is a lot we can learn. From the perspective of organisational performance, \ncollective agility is about accepting what is unpredictable and uncontrollable, while actively enacting \nthose organisational dimensions that generate capabilities to perform under such circumstances. Table \n9 presents examples of organisational practices from the case that could be useful to practitioners who \nshare the interest in what it takes to \u201cbe agile\u201d. In the sections below, we explore further by asking the \nquestions of when, what, who, where and how is such case-specific collective agility performed. Our \nimplications should be taken in the round \u2013 we see each as part of a cumulative recommendation for \nthose engaged in similar practices rather than an isolated concept.  \nWhen is collective agility performed? \nAgility is indicated when faced with environmental turbulences, uncertainties, and an innovative or \nexploratory task, as is the case with GridPP. Yet organisational improvisations come with risks and, \nfor example, may not be the most efficient or effective way to tackle certain problems, despite being \npreferred by a community drawing on their past success. The particle physics community\u2019s tradition of \nexperimental scientific investigation and pragmatic problem-solving means an agile approach is \n\u201cnatural\u201d rather than contrived, yet this may also means it is \u201cassumed\u201d rather than \u201cconsidered\u201d. \nOver-reliance on improvisation can also lead to an amplification of unexpected events and crises, self-\ngenerating a negative spiral of uncertainties and complexities (Cunha et al., 1999). Communities \nengaging in large scale and distributed systems development are thus faced with the challenge of \ngetting the appropriate mixture of improvisation and structure. As expressed by the concept of learned \nimprovisation, we argue agility can (to degrees) be learnt. Communities accustomed to more formal \nmanagement approaches are not incapable of achieving agile performance. On the contrary, our \nresearch suggests, organisations with established routines and strong cultures to draw upon might be \nbetter equipped to improvise than those without. But this needs cultivation of the space and motivation \n  21 \nto diverge from or reinterpret established routines. Collective agility is performed when some \u201ctools \nare dropped\u201d (Weick, 1993a), and surprise, risk and wonder are accepted in the community. \nWhat is (the spirit of) collective agility? \nWe argue here that collective agility is supported by a sustained mood of anxious confidence. Anxiety \nstems from the nature of innovative tasks, and in the sense of urgency, pressure and demand for speed \nin problem solving. A successful innovative community needs a countervailing level of confidence \nwhich can stem from strong individual skills and experience under demanding conditions, as well as a \nhistory of technical success as well as appropriate social settings. This confidence can arise in part \nfrom an appreciation for the \u201caesthetics of imperfection\u201d. An atmosphere of experimentation, trust, \nshared goal, and emotional bonds provides individuals and groups with confidence to make mistakes, \nin the knowledge that failures are legitimate and can contribute to the cause of the community. \nWho undertakes collective agility?  \nThe competence of the people, the level of determination and motivation, and how well the group gets \non, were identified by GridPP members as the most positive aspects of the project. Performing \ncollective agility poses a high demand on individual skills and mental attitudes. Like most professional \ndomains, recruits are expected to be self-motivated, good communicators and able to work in a \ncollaborative environment. Distinctively though, GridPP prefers people who are familiar with the \ninstitutional culture of the particle physics community, and who are thus motivated to step up and do \nthe dirty work when necessary without explicit instruction or reward. The level of commitment, \ndevotion and voluntarism appear higher than one might observe in some commercial contexts. While \nindividuals certainly have personal career interests at stake, many express a sense of pride in working \nfor a higher cause, perhaps explaining their willingness to undertake unpopular tasks when needed.  \nWhere does collective agility happen? \nThe literature suggests that both improvisation and agility are more easily performed in small groups, \nsuch as a jazz ensemble or small development teams. Our case shows agility is possible in a large and \ndistributed group, when the \u201cambience\u201d is right, although achieving this is itself a major challenge \n(see also Ramesh et al., 2006). Community bonds can alleviate many difficulties but require effort to \nmaintain. Even though GridPP members are accustomed to virtual meetings and a large number of \nemails, they still emphasise the importance of face-to-face communication, and travel extensively to \nmeet up. Being reliant on delivery from many remote partners without the authority over them is often \na source of frustration, thus the ability to exert gentle pressure, to persuade and to negotiate are \nimportant elements in coordinating a collective performance. Meanwhile, barriers of communication \nor an overload of information can also create inefficiencies in a non-hierarchical community. \n  22 \nHow is collective agility performed? \nAs has been repeated throughout the paper, agility requires a mental attitude to, in the words of one \ninterviewee, \u201clet go of control\u201d, yet this does not mean anarchy. High level planning and a minimal \nstructure are required. For GridPP this consists of alignment with goals of doing new physics, a clear \norientation towards the LHC objectives, a shared culture among participants, and a carefully crafted \nminimal structure of project management, and communication channels to allow local \u201cclusters of \nexpertise\u201d to interact. Improvisation at the local level is complimented by structuring at the distributed \nlevel to maintain cohesiveness across the project and to create a sense of community among the \nindependent-thinking actors. Finally organisational improvisation comes with risks. The lack of formal \nplanning and reflexivity may mean that exploitation of novel ideas and knowledge is limited despite a \ngreat deal of exploration, thus creating \u201copportunity traps\u201d. \n7. Conclusions \nThis paper considers agile system development practice from the perspective of organisational \nperformance, reflecting an understanding that systems development processes and activities cannot be \ndiscussed in a vacuum but must be considered in terms of how, in given contexts, they become \nembodied within a set of roles, attitudes and working practices adopted by people \u2013 as a performance. \nFrom this case study we observe that the LHC-Grid unfolds in a constant negotiation and mediation \nbetween design and bricolage (\u2018working things out\u2019), between planning and improvisation, and \nbetween enough success and tolerable and instructive failure. Drawing on previous work on paradox \nwe use a set of improvisation-paradoxes as a framework to examine system development practices \nwithin this distributed development context. This framework, and the attention to collective \nperformance, enables us to elaborate and explore elements often pushed to the background in \ndiscussions of system development, such as environmental conditions, individual skills, professional \ncultures, organisational structures, communication patterns, and interpersonal relationships. The case \nstudy demonstrates in this community of science known to be most rationalistic and analytical, \nsystems development is actually more like an \u201cart\u201d \u2013 visionary, experiential, passionate, agile and \nemergent.  \nThis study has limitations and thus suggests some future research directions. First the context of \nGridPP is clearly distinctive. Experimental physics offers an environment that in many ways embraces \nan agile approach. Studies in other contexts that explore similar themes would be useful, for example \nin the various projects around the world that are developing national health care information \ninfrastructures (Coiera, 2009), or those developing systems for the cloud (Buyya et al, 2009). This \nwork might also suggest some comparison with the ways in which the Internet and its core systems \nand services have developed using a \u2018community centric\u2019 development model, as well as some aspects \nof the open source model (Tuomi, 2002, 2005). While the context and outcomes in such domains are \nrather different, the performative analysis seems to have strong resonance. We also acknowledge that \n  23 \nthe period of this study was one of development and testing rather than of operations and the phase \nchange may have significant consequence on the approach to system development. Indeed, towards \nthe end of the study reported here, there were signs that could indicate a greater emphasis on a more \nstructured approach within the LCG.  \nDespite the limitations discussed above, the contributions from this research are, we believe, \nsignificant.  \nFirst we provide a conceptualisation of agility (collective agility) that differs substantially from the \nmore common concerns with agile methods and behaviour, or with an organisation\u2019s agile potential or \ncapabilities. In contrast, we adopt a performative ontology and develop an understanding of agility \nthrough the concept of enacted emergence. Agility for us is an expression of what people do or \nachieve, rather than what they might do or capabilities they hold. We argue that collective agility, as \nan organisational performance, emerges from collective enactment of certain qualities and processes in \nthe distributed community.  \nSecond, we derive six improvisation-paradoxes from the literature and use them to give a stronger \nconceptualisation to the work of GridPP members as they negotiate the contradictory pressures for \norder and innovation. These paradoxes are used to underline the dynamics of the agile performance; as \nan expression of, and (to a degree) the resolution of, fundamental tensions. It is the mutual constitution \nof elements in tension that allow agility to emerge. \nThird, we offer a contribution to practice by drawing implications from the case, presented as the \nwhen, what, who, where and how of collective agility, and covering both useful practices identified \nand risks to be aware of. These recommendations highlight the means by which collective agility \nmight be achieved and maintained, and offer insights for other domains attempting to construct large-\nscaled distributed infrastructure in an agile fashion. For example, Ramesh et al. (2006) assert that \ndistributed agility faces the challenge of communication, lack of control and lack of trust. Our study \nsuggests that these may not be causes but symptoms of a broader failing to understand the nature of \nagility within such a context. Thus to managers who want to achieve some of the attributes of a \ncollective agile performance, we suggest that communication, control and trust cannot be isolated \nfrom more complex and comprehensive efforts to support and cultivate an innovative culture within \nthe distributed community, and require reflection on questions of balance among the various \nparadoxical tensions embedded.  \nFinally the \u2018enacted emergence\u2019 of collective agility highlights the need for ongoing performances - \nagility is not a \u201cper project\u201d or even less, \u201cper phase\u201d activity and cannot be achieved by a top-down \n\u201cchange programme\u201d. Rather it is a performance that is reflective of multiple collective organisational \npractices. Hence, achieving it must be a long-term aspiration requiring attention and adjustments over \ntime, and like other institutional practices, collective agility may be fragile and easily broken. For \nLCG it might be that the future would be different, and that contractual relationships and a reliance on \n  24 \ntechnical and managerial rationality would prevail once the LHC data begins to flow in bulk. What is \nclear is that many domains where large scale distributed systems are under development can learn \nfrom this case and the paradoxical nature of collective agility.  \nReferences \nAbrahamsson, P., K.

Details of interviews. \n  \n  31 \nQuotations Interviewee Codes \n \nI\u2019m trying not to use the word senior to imply there\u2019s a real hierarchy. I \nmean people get promoted to be professor or whatever but it really hasn\u2019t \nnothing to do with the way it works, okay? That\u2019s internal to the university. \nSo um, those people that you know, formally might seem more senior, this is \nrelevant, their peers with people like [XXXX] and you know, really rely on \npeople like that to make it work technically. So they\u2019re fully trusted to just \nget on with it in the deployment board. Okay? So it\u2019s a fairly flat structure \nreally. There\u2019s no, there\u2019s no company-like structure of management board \nsets policy and another group sets something else and then you know, down \nthe bottom, people do what they\u2019re told. It\u2019s nothing like that at all.  \n \nSo I was going to come at it from the physicists' point of view to start with \nbecause it's very important for the physicists because there's so many things \nthat they have to do in order to be able to interpret something that's been true \nin the data, that they have to trust what other people have done. And this is \neven more so when you have such big detectors as the LHC ones. \n \nAnd if you go into these big bang mode where it takes you two years to put \nthis into production, particularly in a community which is as unstable as this \nis, as uncertain as this is, where changing the beam, which is something \ntotally out of our control, can have implications everywhere, this is not the \nright policy. And you have to be much more agile in the trends in software \nengineering and agile in programming, and I am sure you know all about \nthat. And here you do have to do that. \n \nMember of \nProject \nManagement \nBoard  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGridPP \ntechnical \nexpert (based \nin the UK) \n \n \nLCG \ntechnical \nexpert (based \nat CERN) \n \n[collaboration] \n[democratic \nmeritocracy] \n[flat structure] \n[mutual respect]  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n[trust] \n[PP history and \nculture] \n \n \n \n[agility] \n[pragmatism] \nTable 4.
