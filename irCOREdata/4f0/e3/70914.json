In the last few \ndecades airline networks have become the most conspicuous example of this transport\/urban \neconomy-nexus. The main reason for the rapidly growing importance of airline networks is \nthat they have dramatically decreased geographic and temporal constraints of moving people \nand their knowledge, which are increasingly crucial inputs in the global knowledge economy. \nAs a result, cities have become ever more concerned with the quantity and quality of airline \nconnections, and the purpose of this special issue is to examine some important issues \nassociated with the relation between the geographical development of airline networks and the \nevolution of urban systems. \n \nIn particular, all of the papers in this special issue explore how air transportation networks, \nand the fundamental national and international connectivity they provide cities, lie behind \nprocesses of economic development. ConsequentlyI it is no surprise that in recent years a \nnumber of studies have used the geography of these networks to explore spatiality of the so-\ncalled \u2018world city network\u2019 (WCN) (Taylor, 2004). The papers presented here develop this \narea of research and offer critical interventions into existing debates.  \n \nDerudder et al. open the special issue by examining how information on air passenger flows is \nindeed potentially a prime data source for assessing spatial patterns in this transnational urban \nnetwork. They also argue, however, that previous analyses have been hampered by inadequate \nand\/or partial datasets. They, therefore, present a systematic overview of the most notable \ndata deficiencies, and examine how some of these deficiencies may be rectified. It is argued \nthat future airline-based analyses of urban systems should address these data deficiencies in \norder to enhance the conceptual relevance of the results. Three other papers in this special \nissue present such analyses of urban systems at a variety of scales. These articles are therefore \njoined in their assessment of urban networks from the perspective air transport flows, but \ndiverge in their methodological approach and their geographical focus: Timberlake and Ma \npresent a longitudinal network analysis of the position of the major Chinese cities in airline \nnetworks; Burns et al. apply multidimensional scaling in order to interpret and visualise the \nspatial configuration and positioning of the different metropolitan centres within European air \ntransport flows; and Grubesic et al. draw upon basic graph theoretical techniques to map out \nthe increasingly complex web of second and third tier cities emerging in Europe, Asia and \nNorth America. Taken together, these three studies give a good overview of the variety of \napproaches that has been devised for analysing urban systems through the lens of airline \nflows. \n \nThe starting point of the paper by Timberlake and Ma is the commonplace observation that \nbecause one finds important nodes in the WCN in all major economic regions, one can expect \nthat dynamic regions such as China will have cities that become increasingly important in \nairline networks. Their longitudinal focus therefore analyses the development of airline \nconnections to\/from major Chinese cities, and they thereby specifically focus on two related \nquestions, i.e. (i) the question of the evolution of Chinese cities in the \u2018national urban system\u2019 \nin the light of the gradual opening to global market forces and (ii) the question of the airline \nconnectivity of major Chinese cities in the context of the emerging WCN. The authors\u2019 formal \nnetwork analysis of air passenger flows at different points in time shows that over the last \ndecade Shanghai has become increasingly central to both China\u2019s national urban system and \nthe WCN thus challenging Beijing\u2019s position as leading city in China. Both cities, however, \nhave gradually come to assume more central positions in global airline networks, albeit that \nunder conditions of contemporary globalization Beijing is trailing Shanghai in importance. \nTimberlake and Ma use these results to discuss the merits of the WCN literature in general. \nThey note, for instance, that the changing status of the Chinese capital corresponds to the \ncountry\u2019s increasing involvement with the capitalist world economy, whereas Shanghai\u2019s \nascendancy as the leading world city in China may indicate that global forces have come to \nplay an increasingly important role relative to that of the developmental state. \n \nBurns et al. focus on the spatial implications of the functional proximity between European \nmetropolitan urban regions in terms of air passenger flows. They rightly note that until \nrecently the traditional spatial configuration of the European economic geography was based \non the core-periphery model, with the pentagon extension of Brunet\u2019s famous \u2018Blue Banana\u2019 \nas core area and the remainder of Europe as its periphery (albeit to varying degrees). The \nterritorial cohesion-mantra imposed by the European Spatial Development Perspective \n(ESDP) challenged this core\u2013periphery model, and posited the development of a more \nbalanced, polycentric urban system. The paper by Burns et al. assesses this polycentricism \nfrom the perspective of airline flows, and the authors do so by examining the air transport \nrelations between 28 so-called Metropolitan European Growth Areas (MEGAs). The \nunderlying idea is that a systematic evaluation of these flows will contribute to an enhanced \ncomprehension of the spatial dynamics of the European metropolitan territory that is able to \ngo beyond a standard mapping based on the individual components of the European urban \nsystem. Grubesic et al., in turn, take a global rather than regional perspective in their analysis \nof the air transport\/urban system-nexus. By examining the emerging global hierarchy of cities \nand major metropolitan regions in the context of airline network connectivity, they provide a \nunique insight in the emergence of international urban systems that country-specific and even \nregion-specific analyses are simply unable to capture. Using a proprietary database of nearly \n900 airline carrier schedules for the year 2006, the authors examine regional connectivity \nbetween 4,650 worldwide origins and destinations. Through the application of a Nystuen-\nDacey method for assessing nodal hierarchies, they are able to reveal an increasingly complex \nweb of nodal hierarchies in North America, Europe and Asia.  \n \nThe last paper in this special issue focuses on a somewhat different dimension of the \nconsequences of mounting importance of airline networks. Button and Vega propose to \nexamine the longer-term effects of the modern air transportation system on labour markets \nand labour migration. In addition to the deepening of mobility in production and in capital \nmovement, labour has also become more mobile: the extensiveness of air transportation \nfacilitates easier migration, while the development of low cost carriers makes short-term \nmigration possible. Based on these observations, Button and Vega present an empirical \nanalysis that makes use of aggregate data to look at tends in international labour movements, \nparticularly concerning the European situation, and, to a lesser extent, at recent developments \nwithin the United States. Apart from an analysis of what is going on in terms of the use being \nmade of air transportation by migrants, the paper also reflects on the light this may shed on \nmigration theory in more general terms. \n \nTogether, then, the papers presented in this special issue draw our attention the three \nimportant and inter-related issues in research about the WCN, the airline industry and \ngeographies of the economy more broadly. First, the papers reinforce the need for caution in \nall work that takes airline date and uses it as a proxy for WCN processes. The papers \npresented take us further towards a position where some of the problems that Derudder and \nWitlox (2005) highlight can be resolved but they also highlight the need for much more work \non this topic in the future. In particular, further refining of the way we use patchy and often \nproprietary data that has questionable or block-boxed methodologies requires further \ninnovations in analytical techniques. \n \nSecond, the papers make an important contribution to ongoing discussions about the temporal \ndynamics of the WCN (see Taylor and Aranya, 2008). The various examinations of the \nchanging geographies of airlines and air travel show the constantly dynamic nature of the \nWCN, particularly in Asia. This is important at multiple levels but is particularly significant \nin relation to the third contribution of the papers in this special issue. All of the papers in \ndifferent ways highlight the role of airline networks in the formation of, often unevem, \ngeographies of economic activity and development. The papers further reveal how the \npositionality of particular places in airline networks can be advantageous or detrimental in \nattamepts at regional or city-level economic development (see also Zook and Brunn, 2006).  \n \nIt would seem, therefore, that the three major insights offered by the papers in this special \nissue open up future avenues for research in which airline networks and their role in the \neconomy receive further attention from geographers as part of attempts to contribute to \nbroader debates across the social sciences that further refine our understanding of the WCN \nand geographies of economic activity and uneven development.     \n"}
