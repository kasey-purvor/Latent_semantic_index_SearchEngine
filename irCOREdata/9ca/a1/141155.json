Whilst the reasons behind project failure are\nmany, one recognised factor is the \u2018planning fallacy\u2019 \u2013 over-optimism in the\nplanning phase of a project. Whilst the planning phase of a project may be a\nbattle for acceptance and resource allocation, the execution phase is a battle for\ndelivery. Based on both qualitative and quantitative data gathered from a project\nmanagement simulation, this study set out to establish whether optimism bias\npersists beyond the planning phase and into the execution phase, and, if so, to\nexplore the reasons why. The results confirm the extent and impact of optimism\nbias in initial project planning. More importantly, the contribution of this study is\nto demonstrate on-going or sustained false optimism.\nKeywords: Project, Optimism, Psychological bias, Experiment\n3INTRODUCTION\nWidespread project failure is an organisational and individual problem that\nwarrants examination. At its most simple, in a failed project, targets are set for\nkey parameters \u2013 classically cost, time and benefits \u2013 and then these are\nmissed. Logically, there are two reasons for missing a target \u2013 either it was not\nattainable in the first place, or the implementation suffered failure of some kind.\nThe first of these causes \u2013 how targets are set through planning and approval\nprocesses \u2013 has been well explored. Of particular interest to this paper is that\nbehavioural interventions have been shown to be present in the project planning\nand approval processes. These include \u2018delusional optimism\u2019 on the part of\nstakeholder groups \u2013 planners, managers and assessors. The effect of this is to\nmake planning and approval processes far less effective than expected.\nThe second of the causes \u2013 the process of implementing projects \u2013 is also less\neffective than expected. Our contention is that understanding implementation\nfailures is just as important as the planning and approval process, and that there\nare behavioural interventions that contribute to this. This paper considers the\nrole of delusional optimism in the project implementation.\nThe literature shows that the source of this optimism is made up of three\ncomponents: technical error, political or strategic misrepresentation, and\npsychological bias. This paper reports on a study in which we take an\nunprecedented opportunity to eliminate two of these sources and focus on the\npsychological bias component of this error, to investigate whether it persists\nover the life-cycle of a project. We report the results of a quasi-experiment using\nboth quantitative and qualitative data gathered from 28 teams performing a\nprofit-maximising project simulation. All teams were fully familiarised with the\n4prescribed techniques to plan and control the simulated project. Each team\nreceived the same (near perfect) information, was given time to prepare their\nplans, and was required to make profit predictions both initially and after each\nround of the simulation.\nOnly seven teams achieved a result consistent with or better than their initial\nforecasts \u2013 these were the \u2018performers\u2019. The remaining 75% of teams had over-\nestimated their performance by more than 20% \u2013 in most cases, substantially\nmore. They had exhibited optimism bias. This was to be expected. The interest\nfor this study was in the pattern of how this optimism changed during project\nimplementation. The differences in the behaviours of these teams were notable.\nA second cluster recognised from a fairly early stage that they wouldn\u2019t make\ntheir profit forecasts and revised their forecasts downwards accordingly. They\nwere still overly optimistic about their performance, but did make profit\nadjustments in the right direction. These were the \u2018trackers\u2019. A third cluster,\ndespite getting feedback both from the performance data and the tutors\nindicating that the group was going to under-perform, did not represent this in\ntheir ongoing predictions. Indeed all of these teams came to a point late in the\nsimulation where their profit predictions were seen to \u2018fall off a cliff.\u2019 This cluster\nwe termed the \u2018lemmings\u2019. A fourth cluster, once they realised they were not\ngoing to hit their target, abandoned the reporting process altogether. These\nwere the \u2018lost\u2019.\nQualitative data collected during the study, demonstrate that expertise in the\n\u2018know-how\u2019 to apply planning tools and the \u2018know-what\u2019 about the parameters of\nthe project reinforces sustained false optimism. Paradoxically, instead of\nproviding realism and planning accuracy, the perceived ease of use and\nusefulness of planning tools reinforced a false sense of certainty on the part of\n5these teams. The implications of such behaviours for managers are discussed.\nMost significantly, whilst there are now corrective factors applied to estimates\nfor large capital projects relating to initial estimation bias, there is potential\nbenefit to correct for sustained false optimism, either through identifying and\npreventing its causes, or accepting and compensating for its effects.\nThe intention of the paper is to explore sustained false optimism in projects. The\nreview of current literature is followed by an evaluation of the method of a\nquasi-experiment. The results section offers a fourfold classification of sustained\nfalse optimism and its interpretation. The implications and contributions are\ndiscussed; the contribution of this paper is in confirming the presence of what\nwe have termed, sustained false optimism during project implementation, and\nsome indications of the contributors to this. We describe the challenges that this\nprovides for organisations and conclude with directions for further research.\nPROJECT PERFORMANCE\nA project is a \u201cvehicle of change\u201d, which needs to be delivered in a defined time\nat an agreed cost (Buttrick, 1997, p. 20). Key features characterising a project\nare: a project is unique; each one will differ from every other in some respect;\nprojects have specific objectives (or goals) to achieve; they require resources\nand have budgets; they have schedules and require the effort of people; and,\nmeasures of quality apply (Field and Keller, 1998). However, these common\nelements of a project are also included in routine operations except for one \u2013\nuniqueness (Turner, 1993). In contrast to a \u201cpure\u201d operation, a project includes\na certain degree of uniqueness and dissimilarity as Cicmil (1997, p. 392) notes:\n6\u201cIn any project situation, there is always someone (the client, customer)\nwho has a unique need (an idea) for something new, and some, often\nvague, expectations about tangible outcomes (the creation) of it\u2026\u201d\nThis level of uniqueness, potentially poorly defined expectations, combined with\nfundamental uncertainties about the future mean that estimations of outcomes\nare needed to determine whether a project business case is viable. If accepted,\nthese estimates typically become the measure for success against which the\nproject will be assessed. The compilation and treatment of forecasts then has a\ndirect impact on whether a project goes ahead and whether it is perceived as a\nsuccess or a failure when complete. The volume of projects that are perceived as\nfailures means that the generation and treatment of estimates is worth studying.\nINACCURACIES IN FORECASTS\nAn inaccurate forecast is one where the project actual outturn deviates from the\nplanned or expected outcome. It has been recognised for some time that\ninaccuracies in forecasts are problematic (e.g. Flyvbjerg et al., 2006, Kemerer,\n1991). Road, rail, building and IT projects alike suffer under inaccurate forecasts\n(H. M. Treasury, 2003, MacDonald, 2002): \u201cThere is a demonstrated,\nsystematic, tendency for project appraisers to be overly optimistic\u201d. (H. M.\nTreasury, 2003, p. 2). Project appraisers \u2013 planners, managers, sponsors and\nothers \u2013 are over-optimistic in their forecasts as to when projects will be\ncompleted, within what budget and of what quality (Flyvbjerg et al., 2002,\nSchnaars, 1989). Flyvbjerg et al. (2002, p. 286) suggest the following about the\npersistent trend towards underestimation in transportation infrastructure\nprojects:\n7\u201cNo learning seems to take place in this important and highly costly sector\nof private decision making. This seems strange and invites speculation\nthat the persistent existence over time, location, and project type of\nsignificant and widespread cost under-estimation is a sign that an\nequilibrium has been reached: Strong incentives and weak dis-incentives\nfor under-estimation may have taught project promoters what there is to\nlearn, namely that cost under-estimation pays off.\u201d\nOptimism may have both beneficial (Armor and Zanna, 1998) and harmful\nconsequences (Baumeister et al., 1993). The overestimation of estimates such\nas project costs may reduce the pressure on project members to be productive\n(Abdel-Hamid, 1986). Underestimated project cost estimates may enable\norganisations to competitively bid for business, even though the winning bidder\nmay be the one with the worst prospect of profit (Mumpower, 1991, Thaler,\n1988). Current research literature provides a number of explanations for\noptimism bias (Buehler and Griffin, 2003, Connolly and Dean, 1997) as being\neither technical, political or psychological in nature. Understanding these in\nisolation is a first step and one to which we are contributing in this paper.\nUnderstanding how these effects combine will be an interesting field for further\nstudy.\nTechnical\nForecasting inaccuracies are suggested by some studies (e.g. Morris and Hough,\n1987) to be caused by technical errors. \u2018Technical error\u2019 refers to unreliable or\ninaccurate data, the absence of data or the use of imperfect forecasting\ntechniques.\n8The lack of reliable or accurate data (e.g. from previous projects) may be due to\nthe context in which forecasting is applied. Meyer et al. (2002) compare new\nproduct development projects in four industries in terms of four dimensions \u2013\nthe level of chaos (unpredictability in the initial and underlying conditions),\nunforeseen uncertainty (the level of unpredictable emergence during the\nproject), foreseen uncertainty (the level of predictable emergence during the\nproject) and the level of variation (the difference between this and previous\nprojects). Their study demonstrated a problem for forecasting in the internet\nindustry in particular \u2013 where there was a high level of chaos which would\nprevent accurate forecasting (see Figure 1).\nFigure 1: Uncertainty profiles (Meyer, Loch, & Pich, 2002, p. 96)\nUncertainty Profiles\nPC Notebooks Pharmaceuticals\nChaos\nUnforeseen\nuncertainty\nForeseen\nuncertainty\nVariation\nEarth Moving Internet\nHigh levels of chaos mean that project planners rely on the validity of\nprobabilistic conclusions of future events which are based on historical data\n(Frosdick, 1997). In this respect Shakle (1952, p. 5) states:\n\u201cThe theory of probability, in the form which has been given to it by\nmathematicians and actuaries, is adapted to discovering the tendencies of\na given system under indefinitely repeated trials or experiments. In any\nset of such trials, each trial is, for the purpose of discovering such a\n9tendency, given equal weight with all the others. No individual trial is\nconsidered to have any importance in itself for its own sake, and any\ntendency which may be inductively discovered or predicted as a priority\nfor the system, tells us nothing about any single individual trial which we\nmay propose to make in the future.\u201d\nThe degree of chaos, particularly in internet projects, implies that forecasts\nremain inaccurate. Although perfect knowledge about the future state of an\nenvironment is not possible, technical errors and consequently over and\nunderestimation of project forecasts will occur despite attempts at correction\nthrough clarification and exactitude. However, based on empirical testing of\ndata, technical explanations for optimism bias may be less important than they\nappear. Firstly, if technical error is the reason for inaccuracy, one would expect\nan equal spread of optimism and pessimism over time. However, empirical\nfindings show a significant tendency towards optimistic forecasts. There are\nclearly other contributors here \u2013 political and\/or psychological biases (Flyvbjerg\net al., 2006, Flyvbjerg, 2006).\nDuring project implementation, there are a number of techniques which attempt\nto correct future predictions of project outcome based on current performance.\nFor example, Earned Value management integrates cost, schedule and technical\nperformance and has been widely used for forecasting project durations. The\nEarned Value method provides early indications of project performance to\nhighlight the need for corrective action (Fleming and Koppelman, 1996).\nHowever, employing Earned Value has had limited success in improving the\naccuracy of on-going project estimates (Boehm and DeMarco, 1997, DeMarco,\n1982).\n10\nPolitical\nSome researchers have stated that there are systemic problems in providing\nproject forecasts, even to the point where purposeful underestimation of costs\nand overestimation of scope and time are common to gain project approval and\nfunding (Wachs, 1989). Frequently, pre-sales teams and\/or project managers,\neager to get projects funded, resort to a form of deception (Cliffe et al., 2000),\nover-promising what their project will do, understating how much it will cost,\nand when it will be completed. Many projects start off with budgets that are too\nsmall (Flyvbjerg et al., 2003). In the planning phase, project proposals are not\nfully explored because of the nature of the bidding process to over-promise in\norder to win funding and the frequent need for a rapid response. With the\nbenefit of hindsight, project managers often believe that they have taken on an\noverly ambitious project, committed to by, for instance, a pre-sales team\n(Taylor, 2006).\nHow this bias plays out during project implementation is not clear, though there\nare clearly issues with the \u2018acceptability\u2019 of reports by different stakeholders.\nThis will be an area for further research.\nPsychological\nPolitical \u2018deception\u2019 of project forecasts is an intentional behavioural strategy;\nconscious bias is introduced to increase the probability of gaining project\nacceptance. In contrast, psychological bias subconsciously introduces optimism\ninto initial forecasts. Our purpose here is to determine whether there is any\nevidence that psychological bias should end once initial planning is complete,\nand to understand some of the factors that may drive this bias to be evident in\nproject execution.\n11\nYates (1990) confirmed the presence of two factors that are relevant here: over-\noptimism in estimates, and overconfidence in the reliability of those estimates.\nThe causes behind these two factors have been studied extensively. For\ninstance, when considering future events, people generally have an overly\npositive view of themselves, seeing their outcomes as being more positive than\nthose of other people. They see themselves as less likely to experience negative\nevents and more likely to experience positive events. Known as the \u2018planning\nfallacy\u2019, Tversky and Kahneman (1974) analysed everyday planning practices\nand determined that people generate overly confident and optimistic predictions\nbecause they accentuate their talents and the degree of control they have over\nthe environment (inside view) and neglect or avoid evidence about past\nprediction failure in similar tasks (outside view) (Ying et al., 2006).\nThe dissociation of the past from the present and the strong focus on future\nplan-based outcomes is magnified by the need of the decision-makers to act.\nDoubts about decisions are downgraded and suppressed through wishful thinking\nand the illusion of control (Slovic, 1987, Slovic et al., 1980). The bias towards\npositive stimuli relates to the temptation to give people the answers they want\nto hear, and those answers to have apparent certainty or a perception of a safe\nand predictable world (Beierle, 2004).\nIn addition, individuals tend to fall prey to a host of self-deceptions which lead to\npervasive optimism bias (Sitkin and Weingart, 1995). For example, when\nconsidering future life-events, such as divorce or serious illness, people generally\nhave an overly positive view of themselves, seeing their outcomes as being more\npositive than those of other people. They see themselves as less likely to\nexperience negative events and more likely to experience positive events. This\n12\nphenomenon has been described as unrealistic optimism (Royer, 2000) or\ncomparative optimism (Weinstein, 1980).\nFor the purpose of this study, we have identified from the literature five key\ncontributors to delusional optimism that would be present in the context of\nproject delivery. First, people\u2019s predictions tend to mirror hopes and ambitions\nfor desired outcomes. Rather than considering past outcomes, wishful thinking is\napplied and current intentions are projected into desirable outcomes of future\nevents. This cognitive process of motivated reasoning has been described in\ndetail by Waerneryd (1996) and others (e.g. Pidgeon et al., 1983). A recent\nstudy by Sitkin and Weingart (1995) has shown that when developing mental\nmodels of scenarios in which positive future events occur, certain parts of the\nbrain are more active then when imagining negative future events or past\nevents.\nSecond, based on attribution theory, individuals tend to ascribe successes and\nfailures related to past events to different factors. Frequently, successes are\nattributed to internal causes such as personal ability and resilience, while failures\nare attributed to external forces, such as unfortunate circumstances or a\nparticularly difficult task (Pablo, 1999). Individuals\u2019 explanations of why\nsuccesses or failures occurred have an important effect on whether information\nabout a past event will be considered important for the prediction of an outcome\nof a future event. In particular, past events will be considered of little\nimportance when their failure is attributed to external factors and\/or when\nimplications of the past project could challenge optimistic future plans (Jaafari,\n2001). We term this factor outcome attribution.\n13\nThird, individuals tend to overestimate their personal role in positive outcomes\nrelated to events of the past. They perceive their contributions to be bigger than\nwarranted. This misperception leads them to believe that their locus of control to\nsteer a scenario toward a desired outcome is greater than warranted by\nobjective judgement (Jaafari, 2001). This individual bias is also called the\negocentricity bias (Livingstone Smith, 2004).\nFourth, the expectancy-value model suggests that individuals who are high in\ndispositional optimism versus dispositional pessimism are better at identifying\nsuitable goals. They have great confidence in achieving that goal and are\nresilient in pursuing it. However, when they are not able to identify an attainable\ngoal, these individuals tend to stay committed to the unattainable goal or\ndisengage from goal attainment (give up on the project) (Jemison, 1987). This is\nthe paradox of dispositional optimism.\nFifth, offering a general model for the generation of expectations, Krizan and\nWindschitl (2007) suggest nine mediators influencing individuals\u2019 likely\njudgements for expected outcomes (outcome desirability). Based on this model,\npeople go through three basic cognitive mechanisms in order to form\nexpectations. During the first stage a search for evidence is undertaken. This\nsearch will favour knowledge which is consistent with the desired outcome and\ntherefore it promotes optimism bias, just as repeated simulation of the scenario\nand focusing on a particular entity tend to do. In phase two of expectation\nformation, selected evidence will be evaluated. At this point in the process,\ninformation will then enter the third phase and either undergo differential\nscrutiny or enhanced accuracy, once again leading to bias.\n14\nIn summary, optimism bias is clearly commonly observed and well understood in\nmany fields of human activity. None of the factors identified here as leading to\ndelusional optimism (motivated reasoning, outcome attribution, egocentricity\nbias, the paradox of dispositional optimism, outcome desirability) could be said\nto end with the end of the planning stage of a project. Previous studies (e.g.\nFlyvbjerg, 2006, Kemerer, 1991, MacDonald, 2002, H. M. Treasury, 2003) have\nfocused on biases inherent in the act of planning. Little attention has been paid\nto project execution where project managers take evidence about the progress\nof the project into account. Project execution is usually the longest phase in the\nproject life cycle and it typically consumes the most energy and the most\nresources. However, recent studies have failed to illustrate to what extent\noptimism continues into this phase and if it does, the nature of the psychological\nbias that accompanies it.\nHence, our research question is \u2018Does on-going optimism occur during project\nexecution and if it does, what is the nature of the psychological bias in this\nsustained optimism?\u2019 The author team have seen that sustained false optimism\nwas often present in practice, but such anecdotal evidence was not amenable to\nfurther analysis. The opportunity presented itself for an attempt to isolate the\nphenomenon, and explore it a little further in a controlled environment.\nMETHODS\nThe data for this study were gathered from a project management simulation. In\nthis competitive exercise 28 teams of six students planned and executed the\nsimulated construction of a warehouse under a fixed price contract. The profile\nof the students who participated is as follows:\nTable 1: Profile of sample\n15\nAverage Age Work experience Job function\n25-28 years 24% 0-2 years\n3-5 years\n0%\n30%\nGeneral Management 27%\n29-32 years 37% 6-10 years 44% Project Management 7%\n33-36 years 27% 11+ years 26% HR 2%\n37+ years 12% Sales\/Marketing 12%\nResearch and Development 4%\nIT 10%\nBusiness Development 5%\nConsulting\/Management Services 12%\nFinance\/Banking 10%\nScientific Engineering 11%\nThe participants have a minimum of three years\u2019 work experience with over 90%\nhaving worked in an environment that included some form of project planning\nand control. Our first task in the design of the experiment was that in order to\nisolate psychological reasons for sustained optimism, political and technical\ninfluences had to be avoided. Purposeful over-promising can be excluded\nbecause external stakeholders were not part of the simulation and although it\nwas a competition, there was neither motivation nor any indication that the\nparticipants deliberately inflated their targets. Experiential and technical\nreasons, however, such as the issue of knowing-what (e.g. knowledge) and\nknowing-how (e.g. skill), needed to be addressed in order to avoid any distortion\nof results. In particular during the planning stage but also during the execution\nphase, coaching on technical matters of planning was provided by the tutors.\nSpecifically, in order to plan the entire project, the students were introduced to a\nscheduling technique, cash-flow analysis and Earned Value management as a\ncontrol tool. The planning stage of the simulation included extensive practice of\nthe prescribed tools and techniques. The students carried out \u2018dry-runs\u2019 and\nenquiries about how to apply a technique were fully addressed. Teams were\n16\nrequired to demonstrate use of the tools and this was checked by the tutors. All\nteams were provided with detailed information on the project such as financial\nconstraints, the sequence of work and labour requirements for each package of\nwork several days in advance of the exercise to allow time for planning. During\nthe simulation, the cost of workers, price of materials and lead-times was fixed.\nThe only type of variability was the non-linear progress of work packages.\nThe execution phase of the simulation was run over one day, with teams going\nthrough approximately 20 15-minute decision cycles, depending on how they\nplanned and executed the project. Each cycle required the teams to take\ndecisions about finance arrangements, the acquisition deployment and disposal\nof project resources (e.g. labour, construction equipment, consumables)\ntogether with a profit forecast. Each team recorded their decisions on a form\nwhich was handed to the course tutors, who processed the data and provided a\nprogress report at the end of each cycle. The form also requested the students\nto indicate whether and how their final profit will change. This allowed us to\ntrack the on-going pattern of any optimism in their forecasts. In addition to this\nquantitative data on performance, we also collected qualitative data. The\nqualitative data took the form of short interviews with consenting teams\nbetween the submission of a decision form and the return of a progress report\nfrom the course tutors. The interviews used the following protocol:-\n\uf0b7 \u2018Please explain your current profit forecast?\u2019 OR\n\uf0b7 \u2018Please explain why you have changed your profit forecast?\u2019\nFollow-up questions were sought to provide further clarification of the reasons\nbehind their statements, for example \u2018Why is that?\u2019 and \u2018What do you mean by\nthat?\u2019 Our intent was to avoid any disruption in the flow of the simulation, so\n17\neach interview was limited to a maximum of five minutes. The interviews were\nrecorded for subsequent transcription and analysis. Further data were collected\nin the form of the teams\u2019 reflections on their performance at the end of the\nsimulation \u2013 a compulsory activity.\nRESULTS\nQuantitative analysis\nOf the 28 teams, only seven were above or less than 20% below their original\nprofit forecasts. With a mean forecast of \u00a397k profit, but a mean achievement of\nless than \u00a325k, all the rest of the teams exhibited optimism bias in their initial\nestimating. Overall, this level of performance is slightly better than historical\naverages for the simulation (25% achieve their forecasts, average profit \u00a310k).\nConsidering the dataset as a whole, there was no statistically significant\ncorrelation established between the initial estimates and the final profit figures\nachieved \u2013 the more optimistic groups were not the better performers.\nThe most successful of the teams \u2013 the seven who delivered above or less than\n20% below their initial estimates \u2013 are the performers. In contrast to the rest of\nthe teams, six from this cluster underestimated their final performance. Whilst\nthis is of interest, and will be taken up in \u2018areas for further research\u2019, it is not the\nfocus of this analysis. In particular, the comparison between the routines,\npractices and behaviours of this cluster with other less successful teams, would\nbe most interesting. The performers\u2019 forecasts compared to their achievements\nare shown in Figure 2 and for the purposes of this study this cluster is of no\nfurther interest.\nFigure 2: Forecast and performance data for performers cluster\nThat 75% of the teams exhibited significant optimism bias in their initial\nestimates in itself is of interest, but to answer the research question of whether\noptimism bias was evident throughout the execution phase, the patterns of\nprediction and achieveme\nremaining teams. This analysis indicated three demonstrably different\nbehaviours over time between the remaining teams.\nA second cluster of 7 teams was immediately identifiable from the period by\nperiod data. They took the feedback they received, and used it to adjust their\nprofit forecasts downwards as they went along. For this reason we have termed\nthese, the trackers. Whilst they clearly und\nestimates, their optimism was maintained throughout, albeit reducing as time\nprogressed. Their performance is shown in Figure 3, as for the performers.\nHowever, in order to illustrate this behaviour, the patterns in indivi\nperformance were found to be far more revealing than aggregated patterns, and\nan illustrative example from one of the teams is shown in Figure 4. Their level of\noptimism is represented in the figure by the difference between their period by\nnt were analysed on a period by period basis for these\nerperformed compared to initial\n18\ndual groups\u2019\nperiod forecast, and their final performance. The chart shows the decline in their\noptimism, but even at the end, they were still expecting their results to be better\nthan they actually achieved.\nFigure 3: Forecast and performance\nFigure 4: Time-series for optimism\nThe third cluster of 11 teams, demonstrated a similarly interesting behaviour\npattern. Despite there being no value in maintaining their initial estimates,\nadjustments to initial profit forecasts were relatively minor and it was only late\nin the simulation that significant adjustments downwards were made. In two of\nthese cases, despite evidence that performance was not as they had expected,\ndata for trackers cluster\n- tracker\n19\ntheir\nprofit forecasts were inexplicably increased, before then being revised\ndownwards. This behaviour was demonstrated by\ntermed the lemmings due to their profit forecasts suddenly \u2018falling off a cliff.\u2019\nTheir overall performance is shown in Figure\nlemming-type pattern from the data is shown in Figure 6. This includes an\nunexpected rise in this group\u2019s forecast occurring in period 14, and \u2018the cliff\u2019\nhappening at period 22,\nInterestingly here, and different to\nappears to have disappeared almost entirely at the point where their estimates\nare reduced.\nFigure 5: Forecast and performance data for lemmings\n1\nWe are aware that this is a mythical property of lemmings.\n11 teams, who we have\n5 and an illustrative example of a\ntwo periods before their project was comp\nthat of the trackers, the optimism bias\ncluster\n20\n1\nleted.\nFigure 6: Time-series for optimism\nLastly there were three teams who gave up reporting altogether once it became\nclear that they were not going to achieve anything like their initial profit targets.\nThis was despite the reports being value\nthat of the previous clusters, but with the difference that the disappearance of\ntheir optimism led to a withdrawal from the reporting process. All of these teams\nmade significant losses. The pattern of optimism in the forecasts from one of the\nteams is shown in Figure 7. They maintain behaviour as for the lemmings group\nuntil period 15.

Of these four clusters, three\nexhibited the phenomenon that was the subject of this study\ntermed sustained false optimism\nclusters; for the trackers, it pervaded throughout the project, though reducing\nwith time; for the lemmings it ended very abruptly; for the lost it ended and\nthen switched to overt pessimism. We are not suggesting these are the only\ncategories of behaviour, or that o\nbehaviour. Indeed, Figure 7 shows a clear example of lemming behaviour up\nuntil period 15. Their lapsing into pessimism differentiated their behaviour at the\nend of the project.\nThe second part of our research q\nQualitative analysis\nThe data so far have shown the two aspects of optimism bias (optimistic\nforecasts and overconfidence in their robustness) among the non\n- lost.\n-experiment, we identified four\non-going\n.

From the\nliterature we also identified five psychological biases that would be relevant to\nour phenomenon of sustained false optimism \u2013 motivated reasoning, outcome\nattribution, egocentricity bias, paradox of dispositional optimism, and outcome\ndesirability. The data are framed using these categories.\nThe students took the simulation very seriously, with many groups working late\ninto the night to prepare and hone their plans. Every aspect of the simulation\nwas examined and pored over, often in great detail. As one (typical) student\ncommented:\n\u201cWe think we considered every detail, so we have all the accommodation\nissues, we pay recruitment fees, we have in the equipment not only the\nequipment costs but also the issue insurance till the end of the task when\nthe equipment is needed, all the consumables with the respective stock\nholding costs, cranes. We used supporting tables to help manage all the\ncomplicated stuff like consumables, cranes and the details with the\nworkers. Then we have the fixed overheads and then in the end we have\ninformation relating to the loans \u2013 interest payable, interest receivable.\nWe have a formula \u2026, so it automatically calculates everything.\u201d\nMost teams noted that the prescribed planning tools were easy to use and their\neffectiveness was rarely questioned. When asked about their confidence in their\nplanning, most did not raise any doubts about the suitability of the applied\nplanning tools. Teams found the tools \u2018useful\u2019 because it enabled them to\nvisualise a previously invisible entity.\nIn terms of optimism bias, we noted that the planning tools, in most cases, did\nnot prevent optimistic forecasts from being produced. More importantly, the\n24\napplication of the tools themselves contributed to an artificially high level of\nconfidence in the forecasts. As will be shown, there are a number of reasons for\nthis, with project management tools supporting the psychological biases that\nhave been identified.\nMotivated reasoning\nThis bias is the result of a cerebral process that favours individuals considering\npositive rather than negative outcomes. A number of the teams exhibited this.\nWhen asked about their confidence in the outcome of their planning activities,\nthe majority of teams argued that what they planned would actually occur.\nTypical responses during the early stages of the project execution included:\n\u201cThere are no big surprises that are coming our way.\u201d\nand\n\u201cWe know what will be happening.\u201d\nThe bias and the accompanying rhetoric showed that the positive outcome\npossibility had prevented the consideration in any detail of potential problems.\nOutcome attribution\nThis bias is where a positive outcome is attributed to the actions of the team,\nwhilst any negative outcome is blamed on external factors. For instance, when\nquestioned about the predictive validity of their forecasts, one team member\nnoted that:\n\u201cI think it is down mainly to our teamwork, to our pre-planning and\nbasically working to make sure that all processes are working efficiently\u201d.\n25\nIn addition, although teams revised their plans in order to cope with changes\nthat emerged, they still did not recognise the possibility of further unforeseen\nevents:\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019re going to have more changes of course, but I think we have a\ngood model here.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026which is a little bit disappointing but again we\u2019d planned for this sort of\nthing to be happening. So in a way, that\u2019s what it\u2019s there for, but at the\nsame time, you\u2019re kind of regretful that we should have done \u2013 we should\nhave made the tool totally foolproof and obviously there was a hole in it.\nIt looked foolproof to start with and obviously something slipped through\nthe net. So, hopefully we\u2019ve redesigned it, so hopefully it won\u2019t happen\nagain.\u201d\nTwo things are shown here \u2013 despite the fact that the models were clearly not\nworking, the belief in \u2018we have a good model\u2019 seemed hard to shake.\nFurthermore, the failure of the model was not attributed to students\u2019 actions,\nand the redesign re-established its validity.\nThe belief in the predictive value of their initial planning was reinforced by initial\nperiods of contentment and self-satisfaction. Contingencies were not used and\nprogress was achieved according to plan. Plans were not adjusted and a\ncontinuous need for reflection on planning was eroded. Some teams recognised\nthat they had grown complacent because the project had appeared to be\nproceeding according to plan:\n\u201cThat was the one thing we did, and up until then we had got a bit\ncomplacent because everything was really smooth and then all of a\nsudden\u2026 We couldn\u2019t work out for two cycles why the performance was so\n26\nslow. So probably with hindsight we would have just integrated something\nlike better check-listing I suppose. But we just got lulled into a false\nsense of security I think because it was ticking over very nicely.\u201d\nThe language of the teams, justifying their confidence in their planning despite\ncontradicting data, underlines that they were preoccupied with success rather\nthan failure. The sensitivity of their models to unexpected events was\ndownplayed and an illusion of control over uncertainty exercised. Threats were\nnot considered. It appears that any unexpected events were not given credence\nbecause it contradicted their established routine; a routine to rigidly follow their\nplan. Countermeasures to break out of this routine were not observed or only\nhad a little impact on isolated problems for the non-performing teams.\nEgocentricity bias\nThis is the bias that overstates the influence of the individual on the outcome. It\nwas expressed as a notion of being \u2018in control\u2019 by the participating teams and\ntheir confidence that their actions through their initial planning were sufficiently\nrobust to absorb any unexpected events. However, as the quantitative analysis\nshows, not only were the forecasts highly optimistic, despite the inclusion of\nbuffers and contingencies, but teams also tended to under-adjust their\npredictions. Weak signals such as\n\u201cYeah, we had a slight delay in the progress of the procurement, and the\nroadwork\u201d\nwere in many cases ignored; no questions were asked about whether this\nproblem would have a knock-on effect. Indeed, this \u2018slight delay\u2019 would be very\nlikely to completely throw out the plans for the rest of the project. Problems\nwere looked at in isolation, their impacts downplayed:\n27\n\u201cIt could have been a lot worse\u201d\nand further unexpected events were not taken into consideration. Hence, despite\nthe occurrence of surprises in their projects, teams stubbornly argued that they\nwould be able to recover from any future event \u2013 overstating their influence on\nthe outcome:\n\u201cIt\u2019s based on our own value up to this point, which is where we said it\nwas going to be. So we\u2019re on track for our expected profit at the end.\u201d\n\u201cAll our delays that are happening, we already have a buffer in place for\nthat.\u201d\n\u201cWe have just revisited the spread sheet now and the finances are a little\nbit off what we predicted, and certainly our forecast is a little bit off what\nwe predicted from the last session.\u201d\nParadox of dispositional optimism\nThis was noted from the literature to be present in groups with high dispositional\noptimism. Their response to feedback indicating impending failure would then be\nto continue to hang on to their initial targets until they either finished the project\nor abandoned their optimism and withdrew from the process. The lemmings\ngroup undoubtedly illustrated the former behaviour, whilst the latter was\nprobably best illustrated by the lost groups. They withdrew from the reporting\nprocess and were reluctant to offer subsequent comments or to discuss their\nperformance.\nOutcome desirability\nThis is the bias where the wish to be seen as a high-performing team would\nnaturally lead to bias in the reporting of progress. Whilst we have ample\n28\nevidence of the competitiveness of the teams, there is little to indicate this as\ndirectly having an impact in this study.\nDISCUSSION\nOur research question is: \u2018Does on-going optimism occur in project execution\nand if it does, what is the nature of the psychological bias in this sustained\noptimism?\u2019 This paper establishes the phenomenon of sustained false optimism\n\u2013 the existence of delusional optimism beyond the planning phase of a project.\nIt also provides qualitative evidence as to \u2018why\u2019, based on the presence of five\ncauses of optimism bias: motivated reasoning, outcome attribution, egocentricity\nbias, paradox of dispositional optimism and, possibly, outcome desirability.\nIn the context of this study, optimism bias was observed at a group level. At an\nindividual level, behaviours resulting from optimism bias have been explained by\nbehavioural and social psychology. We propose that throughout the execution of\nthe project simulation students felt prey to a number of cognitive self-deceptions\nleading to biases similar to those described in the planning fallacy (Kahneman\nand Tversky, 1979).\nThe initial profit forecast served as a first reference point and acted as a mental\nanchor for students. For 75% of the teams, this reference point was highly\noptimistic. Lovallo and Kahneman (2003, p. 60) report anchoring as \u201c\u2026one of\nthe strongest and most prevalent of cognitive biases\u201d in the context of project\nplanning. Anchoring leads individuals and teams to hold on to forecasts which\nhave been skewed toward optimism in the first place. Subsequently, contingency\nbudgets for possible expansions or problems occurring throughout the project\nare kept small and frequently prove to be insufficient. The results of this study\n29\nsuggest anchoring occurs throughout all phases of project execution for a\nsignificant proportion of project teams (nearly a third in this study).\nFurther, our findings suggest that in the non-performing teams, optimism in\nforecasts was not reduced through the craft of applying forecasting techniques\n(know-how) and nearly perfect knowledge about the simulated project and its\ndegree of variation (know-what). In contrast, it seems plausible that a high\nperceived ease of use and perceived usefulness in combination with a high\nperceived sense of certainty reinforced the sustainment of optimism. Expert-like\nepistemic and technical arrogance may hence be a factor to critically evaluate.\nHowever, simply accepting that such epistemic and technical arrogance exists,\nand will persist for a percentage of projects (what this is outside this simulation\nneeds to be established), is a first step to finding approaches to work with this\nbehavioural complexity. Key to this may be the external view \u2013 being able to\nbring people into a team who have not been party to earlier optimism or who\nhave not yet developed presumptions towards knowledge and in particular to\ntools. An expert as such will have the skill to question knowledge and tools alike\nthat are often advocated as \u2018self-evidently correct\u2019 (Williams, 2005).\nIt may be possible to develop more sophisticated tools that are able to identify\nbehaviours associated with sustained false optimism, and provide incentives for\ntheir reduction. Most research suggests that optimism in projects and\nprogrammes can be overcome by reducing the behavioural element of bias or by\ncompensating for bias through the inclusion of uplifts. Yet, alongside individual\nand group-related behavioural issues, this research also provides indications that\nthe applied processes and procedures themselves facilitate the creation of\noptimistic planning. Prior to anchoring their projections, individuals have to form\n30\nexpectations in relation to projected outcomes (Krizan and Windschitl, 2007). In\nthe context of this study, the search for evidence may have been influenced by a\nfalse sense of security relating to the planning tools and knowledge available\nthroughout the project simulation. After all, the tools were taught as part of a\nproject planning course. Therefore, students have felt throughout the execution\nphase that the use of these tools would surely lead to success not only in\nplanning, but also during execution of the project simulation. Hence, the taught\n\u2018usefulness\u2019 by the instructors and the resulting perceived \u2018usefulness\u2019 of\nprocesses and procedures to manage uncertainty has partially led to delusional\nsense increased planning quality and certainty. The self-evident correctness of\nthe applied methods may have reinforced the ignorance of uncertainty. Whether\ndeliberate or accidental, such ignorance needs to be counteracted:\n\u201cAs with quality assurance, it is beneficial to have one person whose job\nis to play devil\u2019s advocate \u2013 to look for the reason that a project might fail\nand keep managers and developers from ignoring risks in the planning\nand execution.\u201d (Nelson, 2007, p. 75)\nInstead of unilaterally applying uplifts to compensate for optimism bias, the\nrecommended step is to \u201cConsider whether the optimism bias factor can be\nreduced according to the extent to which the contributory factors have been\nmanaged and mitigated.\u201d (H. M. Treasury, 2003). Similarly, adding more\nprocesses is unlikely to be helpful. Recognising and working with behaviours is\nmore likely to improve results.\nThe implications of these behavioural interventions for project implementation\nare significant. Having a non-performing project is undesirable, but the\nbehaviours shown here indicate that traditional control systems may be unable\nto prevent impending failure. A tracker would exhibit significant optimism\n31\nthroughout the project, as would a lemming. The only difference for the\norganisation is the timing of the realisation that there is a problem. A lost\nproject, similarly, would be problematic, with optimism preceding withdrawal\nfrom the reporting process potentially providing a warning, but again, may be\ntoo late for remedial action to be taken. Any of these, both personally for PM\nprofessionals and organisationally, are damaging.\nLimitations\nThis study is not without its limitations. As we have already alluded to, carrying\nout a quasi-experiment as part of an MBA project simulation offered us the\nunique opportunity to largely exclude the aspects of technical error and strategic\nmisrepresentation in a predominantly linear and predictive environment.\nHowever, the environment in which we carried out the experiment will have had\nan influence on the extent and nature of sustained optimism. For example, the\nstudents were prescribed to adhere to a range of planning tools. Such\nenforcement, although not untypical in real-life projects, may have distorted the\nparticipants\u2019 perception about their degree of realism.\nConclusions\nThe contribution of this paper is to show that the previously observed\nphenomenon of optimism bias is not restricted to the planning phase of projects.\nInstead, it has been observed, throughout the execution of a project, to be\npresent in a significant group of projects that failed to meet their initial\nperformance forecasts. This we have termed, sustained false optimism. The\ncontribution of psychological bias to this sustained false optimism has been\nexplored.\n32\nWhilst tools and techniques \u2013 earned value in particular \u2013 attempt to predict\nproject out-turn, they do rely on good data. Behavioural interventions, such as\nthose seen in 75% of the teams in this simulation, give an indication of\ninterventions that prevent such \u2018good data\u2019 being presented or used by a team.\nGaining an understanding of the cognitive mechanisms that led to such\nbehaviours may help to identify possible remedies in order to better predict\nproject out-turn in the future, or simply stop projects that may otherwise end up\nas non-performing.\nFUTURE RESEARCH\nIn this study, we have investigated one aspect of sustained false optimism \u2013 the\ncontribution of psychological bias. The findings of such a study are clearly\nindicative rather than comprehensive, and their application in practice is an\nimmediate avenue for further work. Further simulation will also provide\nadditional insights for testing in practice. For instance, future research may\ninclude the introduction of external cues \u2013 the mean performance in this\nsimulation over hundreds of groups is nearer to a \u00a310k profit. Half the groups in\na future study may be given this information, and the response to it studied to\nsee at what point it impacts on their decision-making.\nThe other contributors to sustaining false optimism \u2013 political and technical bias\n\u2013 also need to be considered. Whilst they are well understood for project\nplanning and appraisal, there are important differences in the roles played by\nkey stakeholders in implementation that makes further exploration worthwhile.\nFollowing from this, the interaction and combination of these contributors should\nbe examined.\n33\nOf the seven teams in the performers cluster, six had underestimated their\nperformance. This group is of interest and further work could be conducted to\ncompare their behaviours with those of the other clusters.\nFinally, further studies which, like this one, offer opportunities of gathering data\nfrom a range of teams performing the planning and execution of similar tasks\nunder similar epistemic conditions are needed to better understand the wider\nrange of \u2018behavioural interventions\u2019 that are evident in projects. Such studies\nmay be carried out in an industrial but controllable setting, with the impact of\nvariables such as task complexity and different tools and techniques of planning,\nmonitoring and controlling, on behaviours evaluated. It does appear that \u2018self-\nevident correct processes\u2019 are not at all robust with regard to behavioural\ninterventions and this is a rich vein for research in the future.\n34\nREFERENCES\nABDEL-HAMID, T.
