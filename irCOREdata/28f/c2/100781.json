INTRODUCTION\nOPTIMIZATION of the charge transport properties ofsemi-insulating CdTe crystals is crucial to the successful\ndevelopment of large volume radiation detectors. Many ef-\nforts have been reported over several decades concerning the\ngrowth of high resistivity CdTe, using techniques such as the\nTravelling Heater Method (THM) or Vertical Gradient Freeze\n(VGF), summarized in [1]. In order to produce large volume\nradiation detectors with the highest energy resolution, it is\ncritical to combine high material resistivity ( cm) with\nhigh electron and hole mobility-lifetime products .\nIn this paper we present a study of electron and hole charge\ntransport in chlorine doped CdTe (CdTe:Cl) grown by THM at\nEurorad (France). By independent measurement of both mo-\nbility and for electrons and holes, the influence of these\nparameters on electron and hole drift length is investigated. In\naddition, the spatial uniformity of drift mobility in CdTe was\nmeasured using an ion beam implementation of the Time of\nFlight (TOF) method. This technique of time-resolved ion beam\ninduced charge (IBIC) imaging has recently been developed at\nthe University of Surrey\u2019s nuclear microbeam [2].\nTOF drift mobility measurements on semi insulating mate-\nrials have been reported by many workers, with some of the\nfirst data obtained from high resistivity CdTe reported by Zanio\net al. [3] using alpha-particle induced pulses. Eisen et al. [4]\nperformed a comparison of alpha-particle induced mobility\nManuscript received December 1, 2004; revised July 1, 2005. A. W. Davies,\nA.

Laser-induced TOF mobility mea-\nsurements have also been performed in VGF CdTe [5], THM\nCdTe [6], and HPB CdZnTe [7]\u2013[9]. Overall these studies\nshow broadly similar electron mobilities in CdTe and CdZnTe,\nreaching 1100 cm \/Vs in the best material, whereas the hole\nmobility in CdZnTe is generally smaller than in CdTe (typically\n90 cm \/Vs). In contrast however the mobility-lifetime products,\nwhich are the primary measure of detector performance, are\ngenerally larger in HPB CdZnTe than for THM CdTe:Cl. This\nis particularly noticeable for electrons, where the mobility-life-\ntime product for high quality CdZnTe is typically\ncm \/V [10].\nDirect measurements of the spatial uniformity of drift mo-\nbility and mobility-lifetime product have not previously been\nreported; however there has been considerable speculation\nabout the role of tellurium inclusions and other extended de-\nfects in degrading the signal amplitude response in both CdTe\nand CdZnTe.\nII. THEORY\nThe measurement of carrier drift mobility in semi insulating\nCdTe and other high resistivity semiconductor materials re-\nquires a dynamic method, such as the TOF technique. In the\nTOF technique free carriers are produced in the material using\na suitable form of irradiation, such as a pulsed electron beam,\nan alpha-particle source, or a fast laser pulse. The carrier drift\ntime is measured directly either from the induced current\npulse, or from the charge pulse. For carriers drifting across a\nthickness the drift mobility is given by\n(1)\nwhere is the applied voltage across the material thickness.\nIn this study TOF measurements were carried out on single\ncrystal bulk CdTe material, with devices fabricated using planar\nohmic contacts in a \u201csandwich\u201d configuration. An alpha-particle\nsource is conveniently used to generate electron hole pairs at\na depth of approximately 20 m below the incident contact.\nConsequently the induced signal is predominantly due to single\ncarrier transport, corresponding to electron transport when the\nalpha particles are incident on the cathode, and hole transport\nwhen incident on the anode.\nIn the thick CdTe samples used for this study typical electron\nand hole drift times are 1\u20135 s, compared to the mean electron\nand hole lifetimes in this material of 1 s. Consequently a\nsignificant proportion of the initially-generated charge carriers\ndrift across the entire thickness of the device, and the measured\n0018-9499\/$20.00 \u00a9 2005 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

EXPERIMENTAL METHOD\nThe drift mobility and mobility-lifetime product for electrons\nand holes was measured in THM-grown CdTe:Cl as a function\nof temperature using alpha-particle induced TOF. Two CdTe de-\nvices were used in these measurements: device 1 consisted of\na 9 mm thick detector with an active surface area of approxi-\nmately 50 mm , and device 2 was a 1.2 mm thick device with\nan active surface area of 150 mm . The samples were mounted\nin a temperature-controlled cryostat. An automatic temperature\ncontroller was used to vary the sample temperature in the range\n190\u2013300 K.\nAlpha-particle induced pulses were recorded using a dig-\nital oscilloscope, connected to the sample via two alternative\nschemes. In the first method current pulses were recorded using\na high gain (1 MV\/A) current amplifier directly connected to\nthe CdTe detector. The current amplifier bandwidth was 1.8\nMHz. The typical pulse amplitude at the amplifier output was\n30\u201350 mV, depending on bias voltage. Signal averaging was\napplied to the current pulses using the digital oscilloscope in\norder to improve the signal\/noise ratio. A typical current pulse\nshape is shown in Fig. 1(a), where the fast initial transient is\ndue to the limited time response of the measuring system.\nIn the second method the detector was connected to a charge\nsensitive integrating preamplifier (eV Products model 550).\nThe preamplifier risetime was approximately 100 ns, and the\nsensitivity was 3.6 mV\/fC which produced a typical pulse\namplitude of 200\u2013500 mV. The signal\/noise of single charge\npulses was considerably higher than for current pulses, and in-\ndividual charge pulses were digitized without signal averaging\n(Fig. 1(b)).\nFig. 1. Alpha-particle induced pulses used in the TOF method: (a) current\npulse averaged over 32 pulses, (b) single charge pulse with no averaging.\nFor both methods, pulses were acquired from the oscilloscope\nusing LabView software in an event-by-event mode. Various\npulse analysis algorithms were applied to each pulse to extract\nand histogram the required parameter. For measurements the\ncarrier drift time was calculated from the pulse width (current\npulses) or pulse rise time (charge pulses). For measurements\nthe induced charge was calculated from the amplitude of the\ncharge pulses.\nThe incident deposited energy is only approximately 0.9 pJ\nper 5.49 MeV alpha particle, with a flux of 1 kHz of alpha\nparticles onto the sample. Consequently no space charge effects\nwere observed in the device, which was maintained at a steady\nbias voltage. The measured alpha-particle pulse shapes show no\nevidence of polarization effects due to the high local density of\nelectron hole pairs created by each alpha-particle interaction.\nIBIC imaging was performed to investigate the uniformity of\nand in the CdTe devices. In this method a focused proton\nbeam with a beam diameter 3 m was raster-scanned across\nthe sample to produce high resolution maps of signal amplitude\nand carrier drift time. The sample was connected to a charge\nintegrating preamplifier, and individual pulses were acquired\nusing a dedicated data acquisition system. The beam current was\nseverely reduced using collimation slits, so that the proton rate\nonto the sample was 1 kHz.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

The spectroscopy amplifier (shaping time 2 s) was\nused to record the pulse amplitude. By recording a sequence of\namplitude maps at different bias voltage, and by application of\nthe single carrier Hecht equation, a map of was produced\n[11].\nThe waveform digitizer simultaneously recorded the full\npulse shape and hence the rise time of each pulse. This time-re-\nsolved IBIC data was used to extract the mean carrier drift time\nfor each pixel, and hence produce a map of mobility. A more\ncomplete description of this implementation of time-resolved\ndigital IBIC can be found in [2].\nIV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nTypical examples of an alpha-particle induced current and\ncharge pulse from device 1 are shown in Fig. 1, acquired at a\nbias voltage of 100 V. In both cases the pulses were produced\nby cathode irradiation of the device, and are due to electron\ntransport. The current pulse has a duration of 3 s, with a\nsteady-state amplitude of 35 mV, corresponding to a current\ninduced at the device electrode of 35 nA. The sharp spike at the\nbeginning of the pulse is caused by poor impedance matching,\nand has a time structure determined by the bandwidth of the\ncurrent amplifier.\nThe charge pulses were used for the analysis of drift times and\nsignal amplitudes in this work, due to the superior signal\/noise\ncompared to current pulses.\nRoom temperature electron and hole drift mobilities for de-\nvice 2 are shown in Fig. 2, calculated from plots of 1\/T versus\napplied voltage. For electrons, the measured drift time across\nthe device thickness (1.2 mm) varied from 3.2 s at 7 V\nto 0.35 s at 41 V, and showed good linearity with no sat-\nuration. The drift times measured for holes varied from 6.9 s\nFig. 3. Electron and hole drift mobility, as a function of temperature. The\ndashed lines are to aid the eye.\nat 15 V to 3.8 s at 42 V. The amplitude of the hole\npulses was considerably less than that of electrons, due to the\nshorter hole mean drift length.\nThe room temperature mobilities obtained from this data\nwere 880 50 cm \/Vs and 90 25 cm \/Vs. These\nroom temperature mobility values are similar to those reported\nby Suzuki et al. [6] for THM-CdTe grown by Acrorad, which\nwere measured using laser-induced TOF (1100 cm \/Vs for\nelectrons and 88 cm \/Vs for holes at room temperature).\nThe temperature variation of the electron and hole drift mo-\nbility in device 2 was measured from K to K,\nas shown in Fig. 3. Reduction of the temperature from 300 K to\n190 K caused an increase in electron mobility to 1150 cm \/Vs,\ndue principally to an increase in scattering mobility at low tem-\nperature. In contrast for holes, reduction in temperature over the\nsame range causes the hole mobility to fall to 20 cm \/Vs.\nThese mobility data follow the same trend at low temperature\nas that reported by Suzuki et al. [6] for THM-grown CdTe pro-\nduced by Acrorad. In general, a temperature dependent mobility\ncan be described by a trap-controlled mobility where\n(5)\nand where is a theoretically-determined temperature de-\npendent mobility due to ionized impurity and optical phonon\nscattering. Suzuki et al. deduced a shallow donor level with an\nenergy of 28 meV below the conduction band which influences\nthe electron transport, and an acceptor level 140 meV above the\nvalance band which limits the hole transport. These states have\nbeen ascribed to chlorine vacancy complexes, and the A-Centre,\nrespectively. In our data further experimental measurements are\nrequired in the temperature range 100\u2013190 K to confirm the trap\nenergies in the Eurorad material.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Variation of electron and hole \u0016\u001c from device 2, as a function of\ntemperature. The dashed lines are to guide the eye.\nAnalysis of the charge pulse amplitudes as a function of bias\nvoltage for electron and hole induced pulses was used to calcu-\nlate and for device 2. At 300 K the mobility-life-\ntime products for electrons and holes were\ncm \/V and cm \/V. These values are compa-\nrable to those reported for other THM-grown CdTe [4].\nThe temperature dependence of and is shown in\nFig. 4. Reducing the temperature from 300 K to\n240 K produces no significant change in ; however at\n190 K increases to cm \/V reflecting the increase\nin mobility. The electron mean lifetime remains approximately\nconstant over this temperature range, with a value of approxi-\nmately 0.7\u20130.8 us. Similarly, the dependence of with tem-\nperature shows a decrease to cm \/V at 190 K,\ncorresponding to the underlying decrease in hole mobility.\nIBIC was used in both regular and time-resolved modes to\nstudy the spatial uniformity of the electron signal amplitude,\ndrift time and mobility, All the IBIC measurements were car-\nried out on device 1 (thickness 9 mm) using a 2 MeV scanning\nproton beam. The device measured was at room temperature,\nand the proton beam was scanned over the cathode electrode.\nA bias of 150 V was applied to the cathode, with the anode\nconnected to ground. The resulting charge pulses were due to\nelectron transport through the device.\nFig. 5 shows an IBIC map of signal amplitude. The total size\nof the image is 2 mm by 2 mm. The data shows one corner of\nthe device electrode, with regions to the left and bottom of the\nimage corresponding to exposed CdTe where no metal contact\nis present and no charge transport is observed. The data show\ngood signal amplitude uniformity, which confirms the high uni-\nformity of the electron drift length in this sample. The absence\nof any regions of reduced signal amplitude on length scales of\n1 m confirms the lack of extended trapping centers in this\nmaterial, for example due to tellurium inclusions.\nFig. 5. IBIC map of room temperature signal amplitude in device 2, acquired\nwith a bias of 150 V.\nFig. 6. (a) Time-resolved IBIC map of room temperature electron drift\nmobility in device 1 (thickness 9 mm), acquired with a bias of 150 V, (b)\nhorizontal cross section at pixel Y = 35.\nFrom analysis of the risetime of individual pulses a map of\nelectron drift time was obtained at room temperature. The min-\nimum measurable drift time for the IBIC system is determined\nby the preamplifier rise time, which is approximately 30 ns. In\nthis device, at a bias of 150 V, the typical electron drift time is 5\ns. Within the electrode region, good uniformity was observed\nin the electron drift time. The measured drift time increased sig-\nnificantly at the edge of the electrode, due to a decrease in elec-\ntric field strength in this region.\nUsing (1) the drift time data was rescaled to produce a map of\nelectron drift mobility, shown in Fig. 6(a). The data show a good\nuniformity in , with a typical value of 900 cm \/Vs, as shown\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on May 26, 2009 at 11:25 from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply.\n3078 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE, VOL. 52, NO. 6, DECEMBER 2005\nin Fig. 6(b). The apparent reduction in mobility at the electrode\nedges is nonphysical, and reflects the longer drift times in this\nregion due to reduced field strength. Away from the electrode\nedges, the mobility map shows no regions of reduced electron\nmobility, which is consistent with the uniform signal amplitude\nshown in Fig. 5.\nThe IBIC images demonstrate the excellent uniformity of\ncharge transport in this THM-grown CdTe material. No evidence\nwas observed for extended trapping sites in this sample. Such\ntrapping sites have been observed in CdZnTe, caused by the\npresence of tellurium inclusions with diameters in the range 1\u201310\nm [12]. Using infrared microscopy, tellurium inclusions have\nalso been observed around the wafer edges of THM-grown CdTe\n[13], [14], and further measurements are required to identify the\nnature and extent of charge trapping around such inclusions.\nV. CONCLUSION\nWe have investigated the temperature dependence of drift mo-\nbility and mobility-lifetime product for electrons and holes in\ntwo samples of THM CdTe:Cl material grown by Eurorad. At\nroom temperature the measured electron and hole mobility is\n880 cm \/Vs and 90 cm \/Vs. The trend in mobility as the tem-\nperature is reduced from 300 K to 190 K is very similar to that\nreported in Acrorad grown THM CdTe:Cl, and is consistent with\na transition from an impurity-limited mobility at room temper-\nature to a trap-controlled mobility at lower temperatures.\nMobility-lifetime products were also measured, with values\nat room temperature for electrons and holes of cm \/V\nand cm \/V respectively. The spatial uniformity of elec-\ntron mobility and mobility-lifetime product was investigated\nusing time-resolved IBIC, and demonstrated the excellent uni-\nformity of charge transport in this material.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors are grateful to Professor P.
