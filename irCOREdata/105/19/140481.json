Examples include designs by White[1],\nHerriott[2] and Chernin[3]. Essentially in each case a collimated beam of light is reflected a number of times\nbetween two mirrors to give a total pathlength that can be a considerable multiplier of the physical length\nof the cell. For example, a commercial Herriott cell design folds a 30m beam into a physical length of\n40.5cm[4].\nA second approach to multi-pass cells is to allow overlap of consecutive passes of the light beam across\nthe cell and either integrate the total output (in the case of integrated cavity output spectroscopy, ICOS, or\ncavity enhanced absorption spectroscopy[5]) or to work in the time domain and measure the decay time of\npulses in the cavity (in the case of cavity ringdown spectroscopy, CRDS[6]). Equivalent pathlengths for\nthese systems are the longest currently available (eg 10 km path in a cavity of physical length 1 m[6]),\nresulting from the use of high quality dielectric mirrors. Confocal designs ease the alignment problem,\nsuch that these very long pathlengths may be aligned with care, but again this is a time-consuming\nprocess.\nEach design has its advantages, and systems may be optimised for improved pathlengths, greater tolerance\nto cell bending during use, overlap between adjacent reflected beams and so on[7]. However, all suffer\nfrom the problem of difficult alignment, which is exacerbated by the need to also misalign potential\noptical paths through etalons and sources of feedback to the laser diode, in order to minimise interference\nfringes in the system. Such fringes are often the performance - limiting source of uncertainty in multi-pass\ncells (as indeed they can be in single pass cells) [8]. Multi-pass cells can be time-consuming to align, and\nmechanical tolerances for field use are tight.\nIt is for these reasons that interest has grown in the use of integrating spheres as gas cells. The internal\nwalls of the sphere have very high levels of reflectance (up to 99%), but this is diffuse \u2013 the light is\nscattered in all directions. Good quality commercial spheres aim to use perfectly Lambertian reflectors,\nsuch that the radiance L (in W m-2 sr-1) from a given point is a constant in any direction. For a cavity with\nspherical geometry, it follows that the irradiance E (in W m-2) received from that point is then constant\nover the entire sphere[9,10]. In the ideal case, after a single pass the irradiance at the sphere walls is\nperfectly uniform over the surface.\n3The advantages are as follows. Alignment tolerances are relaxed and absorption measurements may be\nmade on turbid or irregular samples. Commercial integrating spheres are available as accessories for use\nwith FTIR spectrometers[11]. For measurements using broadband emitters such as LEDs and filtered\nincandescent or discharge lamps, Elterman[10] has demonstrated measurement of the absorption of glass\nsamples, Fry et al.[12] have measured visible absorption in aqueous solutions, Fecht and Johnson[13] have\nadapted a sphere for measurements on falling aqueous sample streams, and Hodgkinson et al.[14] have\nadapted a closed photothermal cell by inserting an integrating cavity. Work at the University of Limerick\nhas resulted in broadband spectroscopic sensors for CO2 (at 1.57\u03bcm and 2\u03bcm)[15] and NO2 and SO2 (in the\nUV\/visible)[16].\nThe use of integrating spheres in TDLS has long been of interest. To our knowledge, Venkatesh et al.[17]\nwere first to use an integrating sphere, monitoring carbon monoxide around 5 \u00b5m. Abdullin and\nLebedev[18] have used a copper sphere with a CO2 laser to measure ammonia, and Tranchart et al.[19] have\nused a 10 cm diameter sphere at 830nm and 1.2\u03bcm to detect water vapour and butane respectively. These\nstudies confirmed that integrating spheres offer increased pathlengths within a relatively small volume\nwithout the need for precise alignment. However, the performance limitations of these systems have not\nbeen established. In Part 1 of this paper, we applied our methodology for the study of diffuse reflections in\nTDLS[20] to the use of optical diffusers in simple, single and dual pass cells. In part 2, we now apply this\nunderstanding to the use of integrating spheres as multipass cells, with particular attention to the\nbehaviour of random laser speckle and self-mixing interference.\n2 Theory\nA complete description of the speckle theory used here is given in Part 1 of this paper. Here, we\nconcentrate on the specifics of the use of integrating spheres. Figure 1 shows a simplified model of the\nintegrating sphere used in our experiments.\nTranchart et al.[19] have shown that for an integrating sphere of internal radius R and high values of mean\nsurface reflectivity \u03c1, the radiant flux (in Watts) \u03a6 for low \u03b1z (\u03b1z \u00ab 1) and high \u03c1 ((1-\u03c1) \u00ab 1) is\napproximated by;\n\uf028 \uf029\uf072\n\uf061\n\uf02d\n\uf0bb\n\uf046\n\uf044\uf046\n1\n0\n0\nz\n(1)\n4where \u03a60 is the radiant flux in the absence of gas, \u0394\u03a6 is the change in radiant flux (\u03a6-\u03a60) and the mean\npathlength for a single pass is z0= 3\n4 R. They then derive the effective total pathlength for low or zero\nabsorbance \u03b1 within the sphere, Zeff;\n\uf028 \uf029\u03c1\nRZ eff\n\uf02d\n\uf0bb\n13\n4 (2)\nWe have shown that in the general case of higher values of \u03b1 and lower \u03c1, the following expression \napplies[21]:\n0ln\nln\nz0 \uf061\uf072\n\uf072\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\n\uf046\n\uf046 (3)\nThe throughput of the sphere is defined as the ratio of light collected at the detector to that entering the\nsphere, and is given by[19]\n1 (1 )\nexit exit\nin total\nf\nf\n\uf072\n\uf072\n\uf046\n\uf03d\n\uf046 \uf02d \uf02d\n(4)\nwhere \u03a6exit is total flux exiting a given port (Watts); \u03a6in is total incident flux (Watts), fexit is exit port\nfraction (area of exit port \/surface area of sphere), ftotal is total port fraction (sum of all port areas\/surface\narea of sphere), and \u03c1 is the sphere wall reflectance (0 \u2264 \u03c1 \u2264 1).\nFigure 1. Simplified model of an integrating sphere, showing a collimated beam making a first pass across\nthe cell to the first strike spot. Two examples are shown of light beams making subsequent random\nmultiple passes across the cell.\nNote that both the equivalent pathlength and the throughput are sensitive functions of the mean surface\nfirst strike\nspot\nphotodetector\nincident\nbeam\nentrance\naperture\nsidewalls with\naverage\nreflectivity \u03c1\nR\n5reflectivity, \u03c1. This parameter is governed by the material reflectivity at the wavelength of operation and\nby the proportion of non-reflective area taken up by, for example, the entrance aperture, photodetector and\nhousing, plus gas inlet and outlet ports. It is not usually sufficient to calculate \u03c1 by using manufacturer\u2019s\nreflectivity data and knowledge of the cell geometry; instead, cell calibration is required using equations\n(1) or (3). This calibration needs to be completed whenever there is a change to the optical set-up inside\nthe sphere, or if in field use, it would need to be completed with sufficient frequency to prevent any build-\nup of dirt inside the sphere from causing the pathlength to drop by enough to render the instrument\nspecification invalid.\n2.1 Random laser speckle\nUsing equations (4)-(6) of Part 1, we can evaluate the uncertainty resulting from random laser speckle as\n\u0394\u03a6\/\u03a60 for both objective and subjective speckle, by making some assumptions about the cell geometry.\nFor our integrating sphere, the lensless detector has a limited field of view (\u00b130\u00b0) that defines the\nillumination geometry of equation (4), Part 1. If we were to use a high NA lens in front of the detector, we\nwould evaluate equation (5), Part 1 assuming L\/a ~ 1. Note that, for each type of speckle, the results are\nindependent of the diameter of the sphere. The results are shown in Table 1, and in this case show the\nsame expected level of uncertainty in the measurement of \u0394\u03a6\/\u03a60.\nTable 1. Estimated uncertainties in detected signals for random laser speckle\nType of speckle Estimated\nuncertainty in \u0394\u03a6\/\u03a60\nEstimated change in \u0394\u03a6\/\u03a60\nunder wavelength modulation c\nObjective speckle (no lens) a 2\uf0b410\u20143 2\uf0b410-3 - 2\uf0b410-7\nSubjective speckle (with lens) b 2\uf0b410-3 2\uf0b410-3 \u2013 2\uf0b410-7\na \u00b130\u00b0 field of view, \u03bb = 1651 nm, D = 1 mm\nb L\/a ~ 1, \u03bb = 1651 nm, D = 1 mm\nc \u0394\u03bb = 0.025 nm, h \u2522 \u03bb \nNow consider the effect of wavelength modulation using equation (9) of Part 1. For h~\u03bb and \u03b4\u03bb~0.025nm, \nthe uncertainty is reduced by a factor of 104, and for higher values of h the improvement is between this\nvalue and unity (no improvement). The resulting expected uncertainty is also given in Table 1.\n6Integrating spheres developed for the mid IR use roughened surfaces coated with gold. For single\nscattering from this surface, the value of h would be equal to twice the RMS deviation of the roughened\nsurface. However, spheres designed for use in the visible and near IR typically use proprietary sintered\npoly [tetrafluoroethylene] (PFTE) materials known as SpectralonTM or ZenithTM. These are multiple\nscatterers, in which light penetrates some distance into the bulk (up to 10mm) before re-emerging in the\nbackscattered direction. These materials produce well-developed, high contrast speckle fields, but the\neffective value of h is unknown. Therefore we cannot predict the expected speckle-related uncertainty\nwith any precision; the range of expectation in Table 1 is very broad, namely 4 orders of magnitude.\nIt should also be noted that the theory above has not taken into account the effects of depolarisation of the\nlight. Multiply scattered light from an integrating sphere is expected to be fully depolarised, and light\nbackscattered from a bulk scattering material such as Spectralon or Zenith may be partially depolarised,\ndepending on the material thickness. Full depolarisation is expected to result in the creation of two\nindependent speckle fields at orthogonal polarisation states[22], which would further reduce the speckle\nuncertainty by a factor of \u221a2.\n2.2 Other interferometric effects\nInterferometric speckle is described in Part 1, section 2.3. However, for an integrating sphere geometry as\nshown in Figure 1 we have disrupted any possible return path of a reference beam. As long as there is no\ndirect line of sight from the entrance aperture window to detector, we do not expect to encounter\ninterferometric speckle effects when using integrating spheres.\nSelf-mixing or feedback interference fringes can arise when low levels of light are backscattered to the\nlaser diode, as described in Part 1, section 2.4. The first strike spot is the main source of feedback to the\nlaser diode. Our experiments (see below) have been designed to minimise this feedback, which is\nparticularly troublesome when using backscattering materials.\n3 Experimental details\nThe details of our experiments are similar to those described in Part 1, with the exception of the\nintegrating sphere itself. Figure 2 shows a schematic diagram.\n7Figure 2. Schematic experimental configuration for 2f wavelength modulation spectroscopy, using a 3f\nline lock.\nTwo integrating spheres were used, both incorporating ZenithTM as the reflective material. The first\n(Thorlabs IS200-4, manufactured by Sphere Optics) had an internal diameter of 50.8 mm; for simplicity\nwe term this the \u201c50 mm sphere\u201d. Light from the laser diode entered the integrating sphere via a 6.35 mm\ndiameter entry port covered by an angled and antireflection coated window (Thorlabs PS812-C). The\ndetector (12.5 mm diameter port, Thorlabs PDA400) was recessed to prevent a direct line of sight light\nfrom the first strike spot, therefore no baffle was necessary. The detector\u2019s field of view was restricted to\n\u00b132\u00b0. Two additional ports (1.5 mm diameter) allowed entry and exit of test gas mixtures. The second\nintegrating sphere (Sphere Optics SPH-4Z-4) had an internal diameter of 101.6 mm (termed the \u201c100 mm\nsphere\u201d) and a similar port arrangement, except that in this case the detector was not recessed and an\ninternal baffle was present. We employed 6mm diameter ports for the inlet aperture and detector, and\n1.5mm diameter ports for the gas inlet and outlet. In a previous publication, we have shown that the\nequivalent pathlength of the 50mm and 100mm spheres, in the absence of gas, was 1.2m and 3.4m\nrespectively[21].\n4 Results\n4.1 Speckle behaviour\nTo confirm the behaviour of random laser speckle inside the 50mm diameter sphere, we took images\nDFB laser\nlaser\ncontroller\nsine\ngenerator\n3f lock-in\namp\ngas reference\nphotodiode\nPID\ncircuit\n\u03a3\n2f lock-\nin amp\nDMM\ngas inlet\n(outlet at 90\u00b0\nto page)\nfirst strike\nspot\nrecessed\ndetector\namp\namp\n8through an open sphere detector port using a silicon CCD camera (Pearpoint P176) and illumination via an\nentrance port at 90\u00b0 from a HeNe laser. As shown in Figure 3, images were taken using a lens placed at\nthe exit port, with the CCD chip at a further distance of 50mm; this geometry decreased the NA and\nshould therefore exaggerate the speckle size.\nFigure 3. Experiment to image subjective speckle in an integrating sphere.\nFigure 4 shows the resulting speckle images taken with different sized lens apertures. Also shown in\nFigure 4 are the speckle sizes predicted using equation (5), Part 1 for L=50mm and \u03bb=633nm. Limited \nresolution of the images means that only the speckles in Figure 4 (d) are fully resolved, therefore images\n(a) \u2013 (c) suffer some loss of contrast to differing degrees.

Images of subjective speckle taken through an open port in a 50mm diameter integrating sphere\nusing a 633nm HeNe laser and a CCD camera. A construction feature (the join between two hemispheres)\nis visible.\nTo understand how the speckle uncertainty could affect gas measurements, we replaced the camera with a\nphotodetector (Thorlabs PD400) at a distance of 50 mm from the lens and illuminated the integrating\nsphere using our 1651 nm DFB laser. 2f-demodulated signals were recorded while the laser injection\ncurrent was ramped in the range 40-70mA, corresponding to a sweep of approximately 21 GHz or 0.2 nm.\nSpectra were recorded for a 10mm and 1mm lens aperture. The results in Figure 5 have been normalised\nto account for differences in the mean recorded light intensity for each aperture. The standard deviation in\nthe baseline was recorded as 0.13\u00d710-3 and 0.68\u00d710-3 respectively, showing a reduction in speckle noise\nby a factor of 5 when the aperture was increased by a factor of 10. This is smaller than the 10-fold\nimprovement that we would have expected from equation (5) of Part 1, but nevertheless shows a\nconsiderable reduction.\n(a) a=12.7mm, \u03b5s = 3\u00b5m (b) a = 7mm, \u03b5s = 5\u00b5m\n(c) a = 0.6mm, \u03b5s = 63\u00b5m (d) a = 0.2mm, \u03b5s = 190\u00b5m\n10mm\n10\nFigure 5. 2f-demodulated signals, normalised for mean recorded intensity, showing a reduction in\nsubjective speckle noise following the use of a larger lens aperture.\n4.2 Self-mixing interference\nThe laser diode was configured with a monitor photodiode at the rear facet in order to record the total laser\ndiode output; we have previously found that this is a robust diagnostic test for self-mixing interference\nfringes as opposed to etalon-generated fringes[23]. Using the 50mm diameter sphere, the exit aperture of\nthe laser diode package was located 100 mm from the sphere first strike spot and for simplicity the\nwindow at the entrance aperture was removed, as shown in Figure 6.\nFigure 6. Experiment to measure the effects of feedback from the first strike spot to the laser diode.\n2f-demodulated signals from the monitor diode were recorded while the DC laser diode current was\nramped from 35 to 70mA. The results in Figure 7 show the generation of a significant, detectable\ninterference fringe whose free spectral range is consistent with the round-trip cavity length from laser to\npackaged DFB\nlaser diode\nmonitor\ndiode\ngas inlet\nport plug\ninserted\n50mm\n-2\u00d710-3\n-1\u00d710-3\n0\n1\u00d710-3\n2\u00d710-3\nlaser current \/ mA\nno\nrm\nal\nis\ned\n2f\nsi\ngn\nal\n\/V\n.V\n-1\n10mm aperture\n1mm aperture\n40 45 50 55 60 65 70\n11\nsphere surface. In a control test, a port plug at the first strike spot was removed to allow the light to pass\nthrough the sphere. The results of this test, also shown in Figure 7, show a broader background fringe\ncaused by the reference monitor photodiode itself; we have previously observed such fringes in more\nextensive self-mixing tests[23]. All our other experiments were conducted without the use of a monitor\nphotodiode at the rear facet, in order to reduce this background fringe.\nOur DFB laser diode is particularly susceptible to self-mixing interference because of its use of a large\ncollimating lens, which acts to collect a greater proportion of backscattered light from the diffusely\nreflecting surface and deliver it to the laser diode. It is therefore possible that a reduced fringe amplitude\nwould result from a better laser design, and from the use of balanced detection. With our apparatus, for the\npurpose of establishing limits of detection in the absence of self-mixing, we chose to simply place the\nlaser diode a considerable distance from the sphere (1 m) in subsequent experiments. This reduces the\nfringes to a negligible level because of two effects: (i) a decrease in the intensity of backscattered light\nreaching the laser diode, and (ii) a reduction in the free spectral range of the fringes, which in a WMS\nexperiment reduces their apparent magnitude [23].\n12\nFigure 7.

Because of reduced signal to noise ratios with the direct scan, a higher concentration of 5770 ppm\nwas used in this experiment. Figure 8 shows the resulting background scan and gas line scan. A baseline\nanalysis yields a deviation from a flat baseline (1\u03c3) at any single point in the scan of 70 ppm or an\nuncertainty in \u0394\u03a6\/\u03a60 of around 3\uf0b410-3, which is close to our predicted value of 2\uf0b410-3 in Table 1.

(a) Raw data, (b) calculated transmission.\nSecondly, we implemented WMS and repeated the spectral scan. Using the 50mm diameter sphere, 2f-\ndemodulated signals were recorded while the dc current was ramped from 40 to 75mA, giving a scan\nacross the methane line of width 22 GHz or 0.2 nm. The lock-in amplifier time constant was set to 1s to\nenable comparison with later results, and data points were recorded every 2s. This resulted in some slight\nloss of spectral resolution, but enabled scans to be completed within a few minutes. The results are shown\nin Figure 9. Analysis of the baseline yields an RMS deviation (1\u03c3) noise equivalent absorbance (NEA) of\naround 10-4 (1.6 ppm for methane). For a WMS dither of 0.025nm, we would expect the intensity\nuncertainty \u0394\u03a6\/\u03a60 to be between 2\uf0b410-3 and 2\uf0b410-7, with a corresponding NEA (via equation (3) in Part\n1) of between 3\uf0b410-3 and 3\uf0b410-7.\n6\n6.5\n7\n8\n8.5\n9\n9.5\nph\not\nod\net\nec\nto\nrs\nig\nna\nl\/\nm\nV\n5770 ppm\nmethane\nHC free air\n(a)\n70 75 80 85 90\ncurrent \/ mA\ntra\nns\nm\nis\nsi\non\n\/%\n(b)\n70\n75\n80\n85\n90\n95\n100\n14\nFigure 9. 2f-demodulated signals taken using a 50mm diameter sphere containing 50 ppm methane and\nhydrocarbon free air.\nIn a final experiment the laser emission was locked to the peak of the absorption line.

The results are shown for both the 50mm and 100mm spheres in Figure 10.\nTheir effective pathlengths at low levels of absorption were established to be 1.2 m and 3.4 m\nrespectively. This calibration followed the methodology established in reference [21], using equation (3)\nto establish the value of \u03c1 with high precision, then applying equation (2) which is valid at low absorption.\nNormalised 2f signals from the 100 mm sphere were approximately 3\u00d7 those from the 50 mm sphere, in\nline with the pathlength ratio of 2.8.\n40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75\ncurrent \/ mA\nno\nrm\nal\nis\ned\n2f\nsi\ngn\nal\n\/V\n.V\n-1\n50ppm methane\nHC free air\n80\n-5\u00d710-4\n0\n5\u00d710-4\n1.0\u00d710-3\n1.5\u00d710-3\n15\nFigure 10. Normalised 2f-demodulated signals taken for different methane concentrations measurements\nin a 50mm diameter and a 100mm diameter sphere. The dashed lines show linear responses.\nLimits of detection were established by taking the RMS deviation of a baseline measurement (1\u03c3) over\nseveral periods of 1min, and normalising to a standard gas measurement. This yielded limits of detection\n(1\u03c3) of 1 ppm for the 50 mm sphere and 0.4 ppm for the 100 mm sphere, translating to NEAs of around\n5 \u00d7 10-5 for both cases. We also measured an optical throughput of 0.3% for the 50 mm sphere\n(corresponding to the ratio of detected power to input power). Despite this low figure, the loss of light was\nnot performance limiting.\n4.4 Assessment of drift\nThe apparatus in Figure 2 was adapted along the lines of Figure 6 in Part 1, so as to include a second\nbeamsplitter taking a proportion (approximately 45%) of the light to a reference detector. This reference\nchannel employed the same model of detector as the main signal channel and the same lock-in amplifier,\nwith an identical set-up. The level of system drift was assessed by continuously recording data (with no gas\nin the cell) over a 21 hour period, for both the signal channel and the reference channel. Allan variance\nplots (\u03c32 as defined by Werle et al.[24]) were calculated for the recorded 2f measurements for each channel,\nusing data normalised by division by the DC signals. These plots are shown in Figure 11 and, as in Part 1,\ndescribe a system dominated by drift.\n10-4\n10-3\n10-2\n10 100\n100 mm sphere\n50 mm sphere\n1000\nno\nrm\nal\nis\ned\n2f\nsi\ngn\nal\n\/V\n.V\n-1\nconcentration \/ ppm\n16\nFigure 11. Allan variance plot for normalised 2f time series data taken over a 21 hour period with an\nempty cell.\nThe system drift appears to reach a maximum level of \u0148(\u03c32) corresponding to an NEA of 4\u00d710-4 for the\nintegrating sphere and 1\u00d710-3 for the reference channel. As we found in Part 1, the reference channel\nconsistently drifts by more than the signal channel (this effect has been found to be repeatable). It may be\nthat our signal channel has a larger and more representative sample of the laser diode output, and that the\nadditional drift in the reference channel is cause by it sampling only a small portion of the beam. Or, our\npellicle beamsplitter may be unstable over long timescales, with small movements affecting the reflected\nreference beam more than the transmitted signal beam.\n5 Discussion and conclusions\nWe expect that random laser speckle is the fundamental performance limiting effect for integrating\nspheres. For direct spectral scans, our results have deviations from a flat baseline of \u0394\u03a6\/\u03a60 = 3\uf0b410-3,\nwhich is of a similar magnitude to the level predicted by our theory (2\uf0b410-3). For WMS, our results yield\nshort-term limits of detection (1\u03c3) of 1 ppm for the 50 mm sphere and 0.4 ppm for the 100 mm sphere, or\nNEAs of around 5 \u00d7 10-5 in both cases. Longer-term drift was found to be at an NEA of 4\u00d710-4 for the\n50mm sphere. These figures fall within our expected range, however that range is too broad to act as\nconfirmation of the theory laid out in Part 1. We expected that speckle-related uncertainty in \u0394\u03a6\/\u03a60 would\nbe identical for spheres of different diameter.\n1 10 100 103 104 105\n10-13\n10-12\n10-11\n10-10\n10-9\n10-8\n10-7\naveraging period \/ sec\nA\nlla\nn\nva\nria\nnc\ne\n\u03c3\n2\n\/(\nV\n.V\n-1\n)2\nsignal channel\nreference channel\n17\nThe main uncertainty in the theory lies in the value of h, the mean optical path deviation for the surface,\nwhich is determined by characteristics of the surface material and not quantified for the Spectralon or\nZenith PTFE scatterers used in our integrating spheres. Assuming our longer-term drift figure of 4\u00d710-4 is\nat or above the level set by equation (9) in Part 1, we can set an upper limit for h at around 10mm. This is\nrather large compared to the figure used for the diffuse optic in Part 1 (6\u03bcm), but is on a scale\ncommensurate with the penetration depth of light into the reflective material. Further work is needed to\ninvestigate this parameter and to test the theory rigorously in this application, as well as to determine\nwhether there are other sources of drift in our system that could be dominating the results.\nThe question then arises, whether there is scope to improve on the limits of detection achieved here.\nFirstly, for the purpose of our experiments we required integrating spheres that could be flexibly\nreconfigured, and used apertures large enough to permit capture of the subjective speckle field. The\nequivalent port area was therefore larger than could be achieved through careful design, and in particular\nthe detector port area and the entrance aperture could be reduced in size. It may be possible to reduce the\ndetector port to 2mm diameter and the entrance aperture to 3mm diameter. This would have the effect of\nincreasing the mean reflectivity of the inner surface of the sphere, by reducing the non-reflective area (ftotal\nin equation (4)), and thereby increasing the pathlength. Using equation (2), we anticipate that mean\npathlengths could then be improved from 1.2 and 3.4 m to approximately 2.8 m and 6.5m respectively for\nthe 50mm and 10mm diameter spheres, improving limits of detection by a factor of approximately 2 in\nboth cases. These pathlength multipliers do not compete with the best alternative multipass cells, but\nnevertheless offer a considerable improvement over single pass cell.\nSecondly, we believe that residual drift effects may persist in our laser diode package, even after removal\nof the internal reference diode used in section 4.2. Previous work has shown that the use of a simple\nbalanced detection scheme can improve the resulting uncertainties by a factor of 10 or more[23]. It is not\ncertain whether this would yield the same improvement to the overall limit of detection, or reveal\nunderlying random speckle noise that we expect to act as the fundamental limit. For an integrating sphere\ngeometry, the noise levels for objective and subjective speckle are both expected to be similar. In contrast\nwith the simple transmission cells of Part 1, the detection aperture for objective speckle is very large,\nreducing the associated speckle noise to a level comparable with subjective speckle recorded using a high\nNA lens.\nThirdly, we know that commercial integrating spheres are designed to give perfectly even irradiance over\nthe surface of the sphere, by using materials that exhibit near ideal Lambertian scattering. For gas\n18\ndetection, our need for simple alignment translates to even irradiance at the surface local to the detector,\nand constant scattering behaviour at the first strike spot. This may offer the potential for designs better\nsuited to gas detection. There may also be scope to better understand the value and role of the parameter h\nborrowed from speckle theory, and to reduce h while maintaining high levels of diffuse scatter.\nWe have confirmed the findings of other workers in this field, namely that integrating spheres are very\nsimple to align, and that etalons are disrupted within the cell as long as there is no direct line of sight from\nthe entrance aperture to the detector. We have also found it straightforward to avoid etalons between the\nentrance aperture window and other \u201cupstream\u201d optics. However, we have discovered that self-mixing or\nfeedback interference can be performance limiting for lasers placed close to the integrating sphere, and\noptical feedback must therefore be reduced to realise low gas detection limits. Finally, although\nintegrating spheres have very low levels of optical throughput (~ 0.3% for the 50 mm sphere), this has not\nlimited performance for the near-infrared InGaAs detectors that we used.\nWe can compare the performance of single pass cells and integrating spheres. In Part 1, using a single pass\ncell with a diffuse transmitter, we demonstrated a short-term NEA (1\u03c3) of 2\u00d710-5, and longer-term drift of\nup to 3\u00d710-4 over 22 hours. Here, our short-term NEA was around 5 \u00d7 10-5 and our long-term drift around\n4\u00d710-4. For the singly scattering diffuser used in Part 1, the value of h was easier to estimate, and indeed\nit would be possible to confirm this by direct measurement, whereas for the multiply scattering material\nused in the integrating sphere its value is unknown. For subjective speckle with the same detection\naperture and the same material properties, we would expect the level of speckle uncertainty to be similar\nfor (i) a single pass cell of length L, and (ii) an integrating sphere of diameter L, with the latter simply\nhaving a further \u221a2 improvement as a result of depolarisation. For objective speckle, the latter has a wider\nfield of view, reducing the expected speckle uncertainty compared to the single pass cell. For both\nobjective and subjective speckle, the limit of detection for the integrating sphere then benefits from its\nlonger pathlength, by a factor of between 20 and 50 depending on how the sphere has been configured (24\nand 34 in our experiments, for the 50mm and 100mm spheres respectively).\nTo conclude, we have studied the effects of random laser speckle and self-mixing interference on TDLS\nbased gas measurements made using integrating spheres. Experiments were conducted at 1651 nm for\ndetection of methane, but the results can be translated to other wavelengths in the near-infrared. For a\ndirect scan using a 50mm diameter commercial integrating sphere, the estimated short-term NEA (1\u03c3) was\n3\uf0b410-3 or 75 ppm methane. Using wavelength modulation spectroscopy reduced the short-term NEA to\naround 5 \u00d7 10-5, corresponding to 1.2 ppm and 0.4 ppm respectively for sphere diameters of 50 mm and\n19\n100 mm. Long-term drift was estimated to be at an NEA of 4\u00d710-4 for the 50mm sphere, using WMS. We\nbelieve there may be scope to improve on these limits in future work.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was carried out under an EPSRC research grant (GR\/T04601\/01).
