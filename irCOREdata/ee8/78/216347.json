INTRODUCTION \nThe empowerment of women, understood as ensuring that women can fully enjoy the \nsame rights as men and are not discriminated against, is normatively desirable. It is \nalso instrumentally valuable because it promotes economic development if women \ncan flourish and freely develop their full potential as talented and productive workers, \nmothers, care givers, and often more responsible managers of households than men in \nmany countries (King and Mason, 2001; Sen, 1999; UNIFEM, 2008). Radical sceptics \nof globalization, among them many feminist writers and non-governmental \norganizations (NGOs), warn of the \u2018masculinity\u2019 of \u2018corporate globalization\u2019 leading \nto subjugation of women across the world (Chafetz, 1984; Ward, 1984; Shiva, 2005; \nEnloe, 2007; Klein, 2007). Christa Wichterich (2000: 167), for example, argues that \nthe \u2018globalized woman is burnt up as a natural fuel: she is the piece-rate worker in \nexport industries (\u2026) the voluntary worker who helps to absorb the shocks of social \ncutbacks and structural adjustment.\u2019 According to this view, globalization may have a \nparticularly pernicious effect on the economic, social, and political life of women as \nprofit-hungry corporations break down communitarian values and interests and breed \nhardships for the weak, particularly women (Parpart, Shirin & Staudt, 2002; \nWichterich, 2000). Of course, there are other voices, equally critical of globalization, \nbut providing a more nuanced view and more rigorous analysis, in which the critique \nis about how the gender inequalities entrenched and promoted by the exploitative \nnature of the trans-national capitalist system and the asymmetric bargaining power \nbetween (foreign) corporations on the one hand and governments, workers and civil \nsociety groups on the other (see, for example, Van Staveren, Elson, Grown & \u00c7a\u011fatay \n(2007) and the many references cited in this edited volume). \n 4 \nContrarily, there are others who argue that globalization liberates women by \nproviding opportunities through trade and investment, precisely because profit-hungry \ncorporations hire the best workers without adhering to traditional social mores that \ntypically privilege men. They argue that higher standards and better rights will spill-\nover to laggard countries, not least because of increased opportunities for employment \nand sensitivity of markets to wishes of the consumers in developed countries \n(Bhagwati, 2004; Spar, 1998; Spar and Yoffie, 1999). The level of globalization \nmight also determine a country\u2019s vulnerability to international pressure for political \nchange. Because of the recent proliferation of global agreements and advocacy \nnetworks, governments desiring \u2018legitimacy and financial capital will want to \ndemonstrate their human rights and democratic credentials\u2019 (Htun and Weldon, 2010, \np. 212).  \nThis study will systematically address the question of whether trade and \ninvestment linkages can diffuse the empowerment of women from high-standard \ncountries to laggards. We also study the effect of general openness to trade and \nforeign direct investment (FDI), understood as the extent of a country\u2019s integration \ninto the global economy, even if this is not the central focus of our argument and \nanalysis. Equally important is clarity about what we do not analyze, namely the \neffects of certain policies such as capital account liberalization, trade liberalization, \ninvestment incentives etc. often associated with globalization. In other words, we \nanalyze the effect of factual globalization and not policies often associated with being \nopen to global processes. Similarly, while trade and FDI are two central aspects of \nglobalization, we acknowledge that globalization has many other features (such as \nmigration and the illegal trafficking of people, for example) not addressed in our \nanalysis. \n 5 \nExisting studies have typically analyzed the effect of general trade openness \nand foreign direct investment (FDI) on women\u2019s empowerment, but they do not \ndistinguish with whom a country transacts. Moreover, while some studies address a \nbroad array of measures of women\u2019s rights, women\u2019s status and material outcomes \n(see, for example, Elson, 1999, Bener\u00eda, 2003; Seguino, 2006, Van Staveren, Elson, \nGrown & \u00c7a\u011fatay, 2007), many studies only cover the employment ratio of women \nand the gender wage gap (Fontana, Joekes & Masika, 1998; Tzannatos, 1999; \nArtecona & Cunningham, 2002; Denis, 2003; Black & Brainerd, 2004; Berik et al. \n2004; Braunstein & Brenner, 2007; Oostendoorp, 2009; Villarreal & Yu, 2007). As \nsome argue, increased employment and higher wages do not amount to empowerment \nif exploitation and abuse accompany these positives (\u00c7a\u011fatay & Ert\u00fcrk, 2004; Elson, \n1999; Fontana & Wood, 2000; Morrisson & J\u00fctting, 2005; Standing, 1999) and while \nglobalization may increase female employment and earnings in some countries, it may \nwell reduce them in others (Kucera & Milberg, 2000). \nOur research therefore departs from previous studies in two important ways. \nFirst, we employ broader measures of women\u2019s rights that include both economic and \nsocial rights, such as marriage and divorce rights, the right of movement, the right to \nproperty, the right to participate in social activities, the right to education, the right to \ninherit etc. Together, women\u2019s economic and social rights are a better gauge of \nfemale empowerment than simple measures of the wage-gap and employment ratios \n(Moghadam, 2007). We use data from Cingranelli and Richards (2009) covering the \nperiod 1981 to 2007 that largely measure the fulfilment of these rights in practice \nrather than their mere existence in legal documents alone. Secondly, we examine \nwhether it matters with whom one trades and receives FDI from, whereas existing \nstudies have examined general openness to trade and FDI. For example, if a country \n 6 \nmainly trades with and receives FDI from countries that violate rights, we would not \nexpect domestic rights to flourish, an argument often made about African trade with \nChina (Taylor, 2006). Given the many arguments around the issue of globalization \nthat focus on spill-over via transnational linkages, such effects should be explicitly \nmodelled to test these arguments (see, similarly, Greenhill, Mosley & Prakash (2009) \non trade-based diffusion of general labour rights). \n \n2. SPATIAL DEPENDENCE IN WOMEN\u2019S ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RIGHTS \nMuch of the literature on globalization and gender rights is critical of globalization\u2019s \neffects on women. This is generally consistent with many of the views expressed by \nNGOs and other parts of civil society that similarly see globalization as something to \nbe resisted because, amongst other things, it dis-empowers women at the hands of the \npatriarchy and authority of male-dominated global capital. Sceptics of globalization \nsee the trade and FDI links as exploitative, leading to the lowering of standards due to \nthe profit motives of globalized capital via a race to the bottom, or at least leading to a \nreluctance of the laggards to raise standards (the \u2018regulatory chill\u2019 thesis) (see the \ndiscussion and references cited in Mosley & Uno, 2007). Underlying such predictions \nis the oft-made assumption that enhanced women\u2019s economic and social rights would \nadd to production costs and thus decrease a country\u2019s competitiveness in globalized \nmarkets, providing an economic incentive for lagging countries to oppose tightening \n(see, for example, Wichterich, 2000; Elias, 2004; Shiva, 2005; Enloe, 2007; Klein, \n2007). \nYet, this literature has recently come under criticism for missing the \nmultifaceted ways in which women are affected by globalization; interestingly, some \nof this criticism is raised by scholars and writers very sympathetic to women\u2019s causes \n 7 \n(Davids & Van Driel, 2005; Lenz, Ullrich & Fersch 2007; Young, 2001). As some \nhave written, \u2018globalization cannot be viewed only as a nightmare scenario (\u2026) one \nhas to recall that the reconfiguration of the Fordist gender order also offers an \nopportunity for women to develop new strategies to achieve gender equality on a \nglobal scale\u2019 (Young, 2001, p. 46\u201347). These arguments critical of the globalization \ncritics are based on the observation that women are not mere passive receivers of \nhardship but are active agents that navigate social, economic and political life and to \nwhom globalization offers new opportunities for challenging existing injustices. Such \narguments are reminiscent of earlier arguments about the spread of modernization that \nallows women a greater part in the social, political and economic lives of societies. \nModernization theorists would argue that greater contact between backward countries \nand more modern economies are likely to raise women\u2019s rights in the backward \ncountries since forces of modernization threaten patriarchy and the discrimination \nagainst women (Donno and Russett, 2004). \nGlobalization optimists thus submit that openness to trade and FDI promote \nwomen\u2019s rights by increasing the opportunities for women to challenge traditional \nways, partly due to the advance of modernization. Yet, what should matter more than \nopenness per se is the fact that trade and FDI link countries with high standards to \nthose that have lower standards, which could trigger processes of diffusion from the \nhigh-standard to the low-standard countries. The phenomenon where policies, \nstandards or similar choices of one unit of analysis depend on the choices of other \nunits of analysis is commonly known as spatial dependence and the hypothesis tested \nin this article is of spatial dependence in women\u2019s economic and social rights working \nvia trade and FDI effects. Specifically, it is suggested that the incentive to raise \n 8 \nwomen\u2019s rights is stronger where, firstly, major trading partners and, secondly, the \nmajor source countries for FDI themselves provide strong rights. \nFrom a theoretical perspective, spatial dependence can result from coercion, \ncompetition, externalities, learning or emulation (Simmons & Elkins, 2004). In other \nwords, units of analysis, call them agents, change their behavior because others \npressurize them to (Levi-Faur, 2005), because they need to find a competitive \nadvantage (Basinger & Hallerberg, 2004), because the strategies carried out by other \nagents affect the payoffs they generate from their own behavior (Genschel & \nPl\u00fcmper, 1997), because agents learn that other strategies proved to be more \nsuccessful (Mooney, 2001; Meseguer, 2005), or because they want to mimic the \nbehavior of others (Weyland, 2005). \nFor the case of spatial dependence in women\u2019s economic and social rights \nworking via trade and FDI links, strict coercion is unlikely to be a prominent channel \nof diffusion, even though the US and the European Union (EU) seem to have become \nmore inclined recently to make improvements in general labor rights, which could \nhave indirect advantages for women, a precondition for granting increased access to \ntheir domestic markets. Persuasion and pressure are more likely candidates than strict \ncoercion, however. In an increasingly mobile world, advocacy networks provide \ntransparency and information to consumers, creating greater awareness, not least \nbecause Western advocacy networks act as watchdogs who tie up with similar \nnetworks across the globe (Keck & Sikkink, 1998; Slaughter, 2004). The global \nwomen\u2019s movement plays an important role as it connects groups from different \ncountries, allowing them to learn from and draw strength from each other as well as to \nmonitor the state of women worldwide and exert pressure for improvements (Naples \n& Desai, 2002). Since globalized companies are likely to value their brand names \n 9 \nmore than local enterprises, these companies will be more sensitive to image (Fung, \nO\u2019Rourke & Sabel, 2001). Multinational corporations are increasingly pressured by \nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR) codes into conforming to norms and values of \nconsumers. Hence, investors and sub-contractors from foreign source countries in \nwhich women\u2019s rights are protected might be prone to employ and push for similar \nrights for women in the countries in which they invest or sub-contract, such that \ncountries which receive most of their FDI from foreign countries in which women\u2019s \nrights are high or export most of their goods and services to these countries should \nexperience upward pressure on their domestic standards. \nCompetition and externalities are also likely reasons for spatial dependence in \naddition to persuasion and pressure. Thus, countries, which export most of their goods \nand services to foreign markets, in which women\u2019s rights are high, or receive most of \ntheir FDI from these countries, might find it more difficult to treat women badly as \nthis creates negative externalities on consumers and possibly also investors abroad \nwho react adversely to such behavior. Vulnerability to global pressure is an important \naspect of trying to understand why the application of women\u2019s rights has occurred \namong diverse countries (democracies and autocracies, rich and poor etc.). More \nglobalized countries naturally are likely to be more, not less vulnerable to such \npressure, particularly from global advocacy networks that name and shame \ngovernments and multinational corporations (Htun & Weldon, 2010; Spar, 1998). Yet, \nit is also likely that suppressing women\u2019s rights will lead to lower bargaining power \nof female employees and thus to lower labor costs, which all other things equal will \nbe attractive to foreign investors and can spur exports, as Seguino (2000a, 2000b) \nargues. Therefore, with two opposing effects operating simultaneously, whether \n 10 \nimproved women\u2019s rights can provide countries with a competitive advantage rather \nthan a disadvantage is essentially an empirical question.  \nFinally, globalization optimists also believe that emulation and learning effects \ncan lead to the transfer of best practices in women\u2019s rights to other countries. Links \ncreated by globalization can spur the spread of norms, rights and values associated \nwith a modern and liberal economy and society from private actors in high-standard \nto private actors in low-standard countries (Held & McGrew, 2002). In addition, we \nshould see the diffusion of public policies adopted in developed countries, where \nwomen\u2019s rights are typically higher, to developing countries where such rights are \ntypically lower or missing (Simmons & Elkins, 2004). While emulation and learning \neffects will not exclusively stem from one\u2019s trading and foreign investment partners, \nof course, such effects depend on cues for normatively desirable behavior. Such cues \nare likely to come, at least in part, from foreign trading partners and foreign investors, \nwhich provide direct personal contact and thus afford a direct contrast to and \ncomparison with domestic standards. There is a large amount of harmonization of \nstandards in the legal sphere and globalized markets could encourage the upward \nharmonization of institutional and regulatory arrangements (Sachs & Warner, 1995). \nThe elimination of discrimination against women is the explicit objective of ILO\u2019s \n\u2018Equal Renumeration Convention\u2019 (No. 100) from 1951 and is covered in other \nagreements with more general remits such as the \u2018Discrimination (Employment and \nOccupation) Convention\u2019 (No. 111) from 1958. While these treaties are old and \nprecede the recent wave of globalization, the ILO\u2019s \u2018Tripartite Declaration of \nPrinciples concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy\u2019 from 1977 \n(revised in 1991 and 2001), and the United Nations\u2019 \u2018Global Compact\u2019 corporate \nsocial responsibility standard from 2001 (see Lozano & Boni, 2002) fall into this \n 11 \nperiod and also cover women\u2019s rights. In sum, why globalization matters can be \nunderstood as the combination of self-interest of economic actors, incentives for \nharmonization, the diffusion of best practices, the harmonization of legal standards, \nand the active mobilization for improved rights by civil society actors and women \ngroups in particular (both local and foreign and linked via the global women\u2019s \nmovement), all converging to pressure change. \n Globalization is likely to have a more direct effect on female empowerment \nthrough economic rights than social rights. This is not least because men have more to \ngain from women achieving higher economic rights compared to women gaining \nhigher social rights. While discrimination against women will always benefit at least \nsome men and thus create entrenched interests in perpetuating such discrimination as \na form of rent-seeking (Braunstein, 2008), gender discrimination is also inefficient \nand costly on the macro-level because productive capacity is not maximized. \nRestricting women\u2019s economic rights is likely to be more costly in economic terms to \nmen than restricting women\u2019s social rights. \nHowever, there are good reasons why social rights are also affected by \nglobalization. First, the fulfilment of some social rights is a prerequisite for achieving \neconomic rights. For example, the economic rights of free choice of profession and \nequality in hiring and promotion practices requires women\u2019s right to an education, the \nfreedom to choose a residence\/domicile and even the freedom to travel, marry whom \nthey want, obtain a passport, and inherit property. Second, economic and social rights \ntend to be strongly correlated (at r = .72 in our sample) because women\u2019s rights can \nonly be comprehensively achieved if both economic and social rights are fulfilled.1 \nAccess to equal social rights in turn allows women greater voice and participation in \neconomic and political realms. Another reason for the positive correlation between the \n 12 \ntwo types of rights is that improved women\u2019s economic rights is likely to lead to \ngreater bargaining power and thus greater economic power of women, which enables \nthem to press for improved social rights. Women are active agents of social change, \nnot merely passive recipients of governmental policies and they will not be content \nwith improved economic rights without concurrent improvements in social rights. The \nsame forces that promote women\u2019s economic rights are therefore likely to have a \npositive impact on social rights as well. \n \n3. EMPIRICAL RESEARCH DESIGN \n(a) Dependent variables \nThe measures of women\u2019s economic and social rights are taken from Cingranelli and \nRichards\u2019 (2009) Human Rights Database. These data are also utilized by specialized \nagencies monitoring the progress of women (UNIFEM, 2008). While it is impossible \nto assess the validity of the codings given there is no equally comprehensive \ncompeting dataset and it is impossible to know the true state of women\u2019s rights across \nthe world, it is encouraging to note that Cingranelli and Richards (2009) provide their \ncoders with very detailed information on how to code the rights, on where to find \ndefinitions on potentially unfamiliar terms, and on how to code with limited \ninformation available. They also provide coders with detailed narratives in \njustification for how selected country year examples should be coded. Moreover, each \ndata point is coded by two trained coders for purposes of quality control and the inter-\ncoder reliability statistics is very high, as described in Cingranelli and Richards \n(2010). Table 1 lists the economic and social rights covered in the database.  \n< Table 1 around here > \n 13 \nNote that the economic rights almost exlusively refer to employee rights, while \nsocial rights include two rights (the right to equal inheritance and the right to own, \nacquire, manage, and retain property brought into marriage) that might be considered \nan economic rather than a social right. Cingranelli and Richards (2009) code women\u2019s \nrights on an ordinal scale from 0 to 3 in the following manner: \n \n(0) There are no economic (social) rights for women under law and systematic \ndiscrimination based on sex may be built into the law. The government tolerates a \nhigh level of discrimination against women. \n(1) There are some economic (social) rights for women under law. However, in \npractice, the government DOES NOT enforce the laws effectively or enforcement \nof laws is weak. The government tolerates a moderate level of discrimination \nagainst women. \n(2) There are some economic (social) rights for women under law. In practice, the \ngovernment DOES enforce these laws effectively. However, the government still \ntolerates a low level of discrimination against women. \n(3) All or nearly all of women's economic (social) rights are guaranteed by law. In \npractice, the government fully and vigorously enforces these laws. The \ngovernment tolerates none or almost no discrimination against women \n \nThe data are coded on the basis of the United States State Department\u2019s Country \nReports on Human Rights Practices, which contain information on how women are \ntreated in every country. They do not merely rely on rights in formal laws since rights \non the books may not match rights in practice. However, UNIFEM (2008) reports that \na measure of gender empowerment (GEM) index constructed with the Cingranelli and \n 14 \nRichards data corresponds quite closely to a measure of an enabling legal \nenvironment for gender empowerment (GEEE). For a detailed description of coding \nrules and for how ambiguous cases are treated, see Cingranelli and Richards (2008). \n \n(b) Explanatory variables \nThe main explanatory variables are what is known as spatial lag variables. They \ncapture the dependent variable (i.e. women\u2019s rights) in foreign countries, weighted by \nsome link function connecting each country to its trading partners and the sending \ncountries of FDI. For the purpose of the analysis here, the weighting matrix measures \nbilateral trade between foreign countries k and domestic country i as well as, in \nseparate spatial lag variables, FDI stocks of countries k in country i. The weighting-\nmatrix is row-standardized.2 This is regarded as common practice (Pl\u00fcmper and \nNeumayer, 2010), but it is also justified here since we are interested merely in the \nidentity of foreign trade and investment partners, while the extent of general trade and \nFDI openness are measured by separate variables. With row-standardization, the \nspatial lag variables represent the weighted average of the dependent variable in \nforeign countries, where the weights are the share that foreign countries have in the \ntrade and inward FDI stock of the country under observation. Formally, the spatial lag \nvariables are defined as 1 1\ntrade\nikt kt\nk\nw y\n\u2212 \u2212\u2211  and 1 1\nFDI\nikt kt\nk\nw y\n\u2212 \u2212\u2211  with bilateral trade and \ninward FDI stocks as the respective connectivity variables between country i and \nforeign countries k. Having defined these formally, we will label these variables as \ntrade- and FDI-weighted spatial lag variables, respectively, in the tables. \nSpatial patterns in women\u2019s rights do not need to be caused by spatial \ndependence. Instead, these patterns might be caused by spatial correlation in other \nfactors influencing or stimulating the dependent variable. Observable as well as \n 15 \nunobservable phenomena such as cultures and customs, preferences and perceptions, \nconstitutions and institutions, and so on are typically spatially clustered, which leads \nto spatial patterns in the dependent variable, even in the absence of spatial \ndependence. Morrisson and J\u00fctting (2005) show that there are important regional \ndifferences with respect to social institutions reflecting long-standing norms, customs \nand traditions, such as genital mutilation and dress codes, marriage, parenting, \ninheritance, ownership and movement rights. Even within regions, there can be \nimportant differences across countries. Ross (2008) argues that women in oil-rich \ncountries are systematically disadvantaged because of a lack of industrialization and \nmodernization. \nDistinguishing such spatial clustering or unobserved spatial heterogeneity from \nspatial dependence is a problem commonly known as Galton\u2019s (1889) problem. If \nspatial clustering is not adequately modeled, then a spatial analysis will spuriously \nsuggest spatial dependence. In other words, the challenge is to identify the true spatial \neffect. Identification rests on the assumption that all the spatial pattern of the \ndependent variable that has nothing to do with spatial dependence itself is fully \nexplained by the independent variables other than the spatial lag. This is a strong \nassumption, and if it does not hold, then the estimated coefficients for the spatial \neffects are likely to be biased. \nA popular method for mitigating the problem created by spatial clustering is the \ninclusion of country fixed effects. Such models take out all of the between variation in \nthe data and are estimated based on the within variation of the data in each \nobservational unit only. This reduces bias because any spatial clustering or \nunobserved spatial heterogeneity in levels of women\u2019s rights is fully captured by the \nfixed effects. However, the inclusion of fixed effects not only makes the estimates \n 16 \nless efficient, but in our specific research context, where we use ordered logit for \nestimating models with a categorical dependent variable, there is no fixed-effects \nestimator (more on this below). \nAnother problem of spatial analysis in cross-sectional time-series analysis is the \nproblem of common shocks and common trends, such as a general increase in \nawareness of women\u2019s rights over time, possibly following from the UN decade for \nwomen (1976-1985) or the World Conferences on Women. We control for this by \nincluding year-specific time fixed effects, i.e. separate intercepts for each year of the \nperiod of study, as well as the temporally lagged dependent variable. Note, however, \nthat the sample means of women\u2019s economic and social rights are almost constant \nover the study period. In other words, while rights have improved in some countries, \nthey have deteriorated in others and on average they have not changed much over \ntime. \nAs control variables, we include general trade openness measured as the ratio of \nthe sum of exports and imports to GDP (trade\/GDP) taken from the World Bank \n(2009), general openness to FDI measured as the value of the total stock of inward \nFDI relative to GDP (FDI\/GDP) taken from UNCTAD (2009),3 the natural log of per \ncapita income (lnGDPpc) in constant US$ of 2000 at market exchange rates taken \nfrom World Bank (2009), and the polity2 variable from the Polity IV data as a \nmeasure of democracy (democracy), which is taken from Marshall, Jaggers & Gurr. \n(2006).4 It would have been preferable to use GDP data in purchasing-power-parity \nrather than at market exchange rates, but the former has more missing data compared \nto the latter and we wish to have as large a sample size as possible. The Polity IV \nproject offers the broadest coverage of all democracy indicators. Codings on a 21-\npoint scale from -10 (most autocratic) to 10 (fully democratic) are based on expert \n 17 \nevaluations of the political regime in countries, relying on a fairly comprehensive \ndefinition of democracy, which includes electoral rules and various measures of the \nopenness of political institutions and aspects of institutionalized democracy and \nautocracy. \nThe inclusion of general trade and FDI openness is important to separate the effect \nof general openness from the spatial lags. Per capita income is included since more \neconomically developed countries are likely to have higher women\u2019s rights (Forsythe, \nKorzeniewicz and Durrant, 2000; Ross, 2008).5 Also, in more democratic societies \nwomen have a voice as voters, which is likely to translate into better rights for \nwomen. \nIn sum, variants of the following model are estimated: \n \n1 1 2 3 4 5ln \/ \/it i it it it it ity y GDPpc democracy trade GDP FDI GDP\u03b1 \u03b2 \u03b2 \u03b2 \u03b2 \u03b2\u2212= + + + + +  \n 6 1 1 7 1 1\ntrade FDI\nikt kt ikt kt t it\nk k\nw y w y u\u03b2 \u03b2 \u03b4\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212\n+ + + +\u2211 \u2211    (1) \n \nWhere i ( )k\u2260  stands for the country under observation, t for time, the control \nvariables are defined as described above and 1 1\ntrade\nikt kt\nk\nw y\n\u2212 \u2212\u2211  and 1 1\nFDI\nikt kt\nk\nw y\n\u2212 \u2212\u2211  are \nthe, respectively, trade- and FDI-weighted spatial lag variables as defined above, i\u03b1  \nrepresent country fixed effects (replaced by regional fixed effects in some \nestimations), t\u03b4  time fixed effects. Note that the spatial lag variables are temporally \nlagged by one year since it is very unlikely that they could exert a contemporaneous \neffect. Table 2 provides summary descriptive variable information and table 3 a \ncorrelation matrix. Other than women\u2019s economic and social rights and their \nrespective trade- or FDI-weighted spatial lag variables, which are highly correlated \n 18 \nwith each other, correlations are not particularly high. In particular, the correlation \nbetween the trade- and the FDI-weighted spatial lag variables for either set of rights is \nfairly modest at .26, which suggests that they measure different types of \nconnectivities. In other words, a typical country\u2019s trading partner is not simply \nidentical to or close to identical to a typical country\u2019s foreign investors and the two \nspatial lag variables thus truly tap into distinct aspects of globalization. \n< Tables 2 and 3 around here > \n \n(c) Estimation Technique \nWomen\u2019s economic and social rights, the dependent variables, are measured as \nordered categorical variables, which take on values of zero, one, two or three. Thus, \nordered logit or probit are appropriate estimation techniques. Unfortunately, these \nmodels cannot estimate country fixed effects.6 As a compromise, we include regional \nrather than country fixed effects in ordered logit estimations, with dummy variables \nfollowing the World Bank\u2019s (2009) classification of countries into regions. We start \nwith a model that contains these regional dummy variables and time-specific fixed \neffects. We then add the lagged dependent variable. Finally, we use a different \nestimator to include country-specific fixed effects, namely Arrelano and Bover\u2019s \n(1995) system-GMM estimator. This estimator is preferable to a standard fixed effects \nestimator since it can treat both the lagged dependent variable and the spatial lag \nvariables as endogenous. The inclusion of the temporally lagged dependent variable in \na fixed effects model leads to so-called Nickell (1981) bias because the lagged \ndependent variable will be correlated with the error term. The endogeneity of the \nspatial lag variable follows from the fact that if foreign countries k have an effect on \ncountry i, then country i also has a (small) effect on foreign countries k. This is not to \n 19 \nbe confused with potential reverse causality, which would occur if domestic women\u2019s \nrights influence the identity of foreign trade and investment partners, thus \nrepresenting another reason for potential endogeneity.7 Kukenova and Monteiro \n(2009) show in Monte Carlo simulations that the system-GMM estimator outperforms \nother estimators for spatial dynamic panel data models with one or more endogenous \nvariables, which is why we use this estimator. Using too many instruments can bias \nthe GMM estimation results (Roodman, 2007). We have therefore restricted the \nmaximum lag of instruments to eight. For both ordered logit and GMM estimations, \nstandard errors are adjusted for clustering of observations on countries. \n \n4. EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS \n(a) Some descriptive case examples \nBefore reporting results from multivariate regression analysis, we briefly discuss a \nfew descriptive cases. Good examples for the potential positive effect that women\u2019s \neconomic rights in a country\u2019s major trading and investment partners can have on \ndomestic rights are Brazil, Mexico and Singapore. The average trade-weighted spatial \nlag variable increased between the first three years and the last three years of our \nstudy period in these countries from 1.42 to 1.89, from 1.80 to 2.67 and from 0.97 to \n1.51, respectively. Similarly, the values of the FDI-weighted spatial lag variable \nincreased in these countries from 1.79 to 2.20, from 2.04 to 2.49 and from 1.47 to \n2.24, respectively. What this means is that women\u2019s rights in these countries\u2019 trading \nand FDI partners have increased and\/or that these countries switched to trading and \nFDI partners with higher women\u2019s rights in the sense of trading and receiving FDI \nmore from high-standards relative to low-standards countries. At the same time, \nwomen\u2019s economic rights improved in these countries. In Brazil, women\u2019s economic \n 20 \nrights moved from 1 to 2.33, in Mexico they moved from 1 to 2 and in Singapore \nfrom 1.33 to 2 on our measure. That is, in all of these countries, the situation for \nwomen improved over the study period because governments started to enforce \nwomen\u2019s economic rights and only tolerated a low level of discrimination against \nwomen\u2019s economic rights rather than a moderate level of discrimination, as at the start \nof the period,. \nSingapore is also telling as an example, as it goes to show that improvements \nin women\u2019s economic rights need not go hand in hand with women\u2019s social rights, \nwhich essentially stayed at a low level in this country. In contrast, Brazil and Mexico \nachieved higher women\u2019s social rights in tandem with improved women\u2019s economic \nrights. All three countries experienced increasing values in the trade- and FDI-\nweighted spatial lag variables for women\u2019s social rights as well, similar to the \nincreasing values of these variables for women\u2019s economic rights.8 \nThe Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Myanmar are good examples \nwhere lower values of the spatial lag variables over time, which means lower values \nof women\u2019s rights in a country\u2019s major trading and FDI partner and\/or a switch of \npartners toward countries with lower rights, went hand in hand with deteriorating \ndomestic women\u2019s economic and social rights. In the DRC, the situation went from 1 \nto 0 for both rights, while in Myanmar it went from 2 to 0.33 (economic rights) and \nfrom 2 to 0 (social rights), that is, basically no rights in either country at the end of the \nstudy period. In the case of Myanmar, one may wonder whether the deterioration in \nwomen\u2019s rights is simply down to the political regime in this country. However, \nMyanmar was as autocratic at the beginning of the 1980s as it was during the end of \nour study period. Still, clearly the examples presented in this brief descriptive analysis \n 21 \nare deficient in the sense that they neither control for other, confounding factors nor \ntest for a general trend, which is why we turn to multivariate regression analysis now. \n \n(b) Multivariate regression analysis \nTable 4 reports estimation results for women\u2019s economic rights for up to 152 \ncountries over the period 1981 to 2007. Models 1 to 3 refer to a sample of all \ncountries, models 4 to 6 to a sample of developing countries. Results from model 1 \nsuggest that women\u2019s rights are higher in richer and more democratic as well as in \ncountries more open to trade. Higher rights abroad seem to spill-over both via trade \nand FDI links into higher domestic rights. However, this result needs to be treated \nwith great care as neither the lagged dependent variable nor country fixed effects are \nyet included.  \n< Table 4 around here > \nIn model 2, we add the temporally lagged dependent variable. The results \nremain consistent with the ones in model 1. In model 3, country fixed effects are \nincluded and the estimator switches from ordered logit to system-GMM. Results are \nsimilar to the ordered logit results in terms of the sign of coefficients and their \nstatistical significance, but the spatial lag variable working via FDI links now \nbecomes statistically insignificant. The degree of spatial dependence indicates by \n\u2018how much\u2019 domestic rights increase for a one unit increase in the spatial lag variable, \nwhich due to row-standardization of the weighting matrix is in the same unit as the \ndependent variable itself. It is roughly .17 in the short run and .35 in the long run. In \nother words, if women\u2019s economic rights in a country\u2019s main trade partners were to \nrise by one point, then this is predicted to raise domestic rights by 0.17 points in the \nshort run and by a bit more than one third of a point in the long run.9 The latter is \n 22 \nequivalent to about one half of a standard deviation of observed values in women\u2019s \neconomic rights, implying that the effect of spatial dependence is not only statistically \nsignificantly different from zero, but also substantively important. \nModels 4 to 6 repeat the same set of estimations for a sample of developing \ncountries only. Results on the control variables are largely compatible with the ones \nreported for the full sample. However, the FDI-weighted spatial lag variable is no \nlonger statistically significant. The trade-weighted spatial lag variable remains \nstatistically significant in models 4 and 5, but becomes (marginally) statistically \ninsignificant in the system-GMM estimations. Note that Arellano-Bond tests of \nautocorrelation in the system-GMM estimations of models 3 and 6 violate the \nassumption of no second-order autocorrelation required for system-GMM to produce \nvalid results. We therefore re-estimated these models with an assumed first-order \nmoving average error process and including two further temporal lags of the \ndependent and one further lag of the endogenous spatial lag variables. The (non-\nreported) results suggest that the first temporal lag of the trade-weighted spatial lag \nvariable has a statistically significant positive effect on women\u2019s economic rights in \nboth the full and the developing country only sample. This further corroborates the \nfinding of positive spatial dependence working via trade links. \nTable 5 reports results for women\u2019s social rights, following the same set of \nestimations as in table 4. Results vary a bit more depending on the sample and the \nestimation model chosen, compared with the results on women\u2019s economic rights. \nHigher women\u2019s social rights seem to be associated with higher per capita income, \nbut only in the full sample. The same is true for democracy (with only one exception, \ndemocracy is insignificant in the developing countries sample). On the whole, \ncountries that are more open to trade in general have higher women\u2019s social rights. \n 23 \nCountries that are more open to FDI in general have higher social rights, but with one \nexception the coefficients of this variable are statistically insignificant for the sample \nthat only contains developing countries. The FDI-weighted spatial lags are \nstatistically significant only in two out of the six models. This suggests that there is no \nconsistent evidence for higher women\u2019s social rights abroad spreading via FDI links. \nIn contrast, there is consistent evidence across all model specifications for spill-over \neffects on social rights via trade links. Comparing models 3 and 6, the degree of \nspatial dependence is somewhat lower in the sample of developing countries in \ncomparison with the full sample, both in the short-run (.18 compared to .32) and in \nthe long run (.32 compared to .58). What this implies is that developing countries are \nless affected by spill-over effects in women\u2019s social rights than developed countries. \nA possible explanation is that women\u2019s social rights might be more culturally \nentrenched and thus less amenable to change from the outside in developing \ncountries. For women\u2019s social rights, Arellano and Bond tests of autocorrelation did \nnot reject the hypothesis of no second-order autocorrelation required for the system-\nGMM estimator to produce valid results. \n< Table 5 around here > \nIn table 6, we split up the developing country sample into low- and middle-\nincome countries. Whilst we cannot account for the gender structure of employment \nin the tradeables sector or in the production processes operated or controlled by \nforeign investors directly, it is plausible that female employment in these sectors is \nmore relevant in middle-income countries than in low-income countries. If so, \nspillover effects should be more relevant in middle-income compared to low-income \ncountries.10 Results reported in table 5 corroborate this hypothesis: there is evidence \nof spatial dependence in middle-income countries, consistent with the results found \n 24 \nfor all countries or for the developing country sample, but no evidence of spatial \ndependence in low-income countries. Note that for women\u2019s economic rights, there is \neven evidence for spillover effect working via FDI links, suggesting that higher \nwomen\u2019s economic rights in a country\u2019s main foreign investment partners leads to \nhigher domestic rights in middle-income countries. \n< Table 6 around here > \n \n5. CONCLUSION \nWomen\u2019s empowerment plays a central role in the development debate. How does \nglobalization affect women\u2019s rights? In contrast to others, this article has analyzed \nthis question in two distinct ways. First, we focused on spatial dependence, addressing \nwhether higher women\u2019s rights abroad spill-over into higher domestic rights via \ntransnational trade and FDI linkages. Secondly, we employed broad measures of \nwomen\u2019s rights that included both economic and social rights. The question of \nwhether higher women\u2019s economic and social rights among a country\u2019s major trade \npartners and investment sources spill-over into higher domestic levels of such rights is \na crucial aspect of the globalization debate. \nWe found consistent evidence for spill-over effects working via trade links for \nboth sets of rights in all samples but the one restricted to low-income countries only. \nWith one exception, this result was independent of the model specification. We found \nonly weak and limited evidence of spill-over effects via FDI links for women\u2019s \neconomic or social rights. Only in middle-income countries do we find consistent \nevidence for such an effect on women\u2019s economic rights, independently of the model \nspecification. Going beyond spatial dependence, we found evidence suggesting that \ngeneral trade openness is conducive to higher women\u2019s economic rights whereas \n 25 \ngeneral FDI openness does not matter, two results which corroborate with updated \ndata and a different estimation strategy results previously reported in Neumayer and \nde Soysa (2007). General trade openness also seems to promote women\u2019s social \nrights, while general FDI openness appears conducive to such rights, but not in \ndeveloping countries. \nIn conclusion, general trade openness as well as spill-over effects working via \ntrade links appear to be aspects of globalization that have a beneficial impact on \nwomen\u2019s rights.11 Whether better women\u2019s rights in absolute terms translate into \nhigher gender equality in rights is difficult to say given we have no measure of men\u2019s \neconomic and social rights. We would, however, point out that, firstly, women\u2019s \nrights are coded in a way as to partly refer to gender equality (e.g., \u201cequal pay for \nequal work\u201d, \u201cequality in hiring and promotion practices\u201d, \u201cthe right to equal \ninheritance\u201d) and, secondly, because men will invariably enjoy many of the relevant \nrights already, any absolute improvements for women will typically translate into \nhigher gender equality as well. More questionable is whether improved rights will \nlead to improved material outcomes for women, which should be a prime objective of \nfuture research. The two measures of women\u2019s rights are only modestly correlated \n(below 0.4) with the ratio of female to male earnings and the gender-related human \ndevelopment index (HDI) as a percentage of the overall HDI (data taken from UNDP \n2009). Moreover, globalization takes many forms beyond the ones looked at here and \nit will have many different effects and will affect some people positively whilst others \nnegatively. However, when it comes to fundamental economic and social rights for \nwomen, on average the specific forms of globalization looked at here are beneficial \nrather than harmful to the empowerment of women. \n 26 \nREFERENCES \nArellano, M. & Bover, O.

In terms of actual \nrepresentation in national parliaments, most countries have only a small share of female \nparliamentarians, however. \n2\n Note that because of row-standardization, it makes no difference whether for the purpose of creating \nthe spatial lag variables, FDI and trade are measured in absolute terms or relative to country i\u2019s GDP or \ngross fixed capital formation. \n3\n FDI stocks relative to GDP has better data availability than FDI stocks relative to gross capital \nformation, which is why we prefer the former. Note, however, that results are robust to using FDI \nstocks relative to gross capital formation instead. \n4\n Other variables, such as women\u2019s mobilization used in Huber, Stephen, Bradly, Moller & Nielsen. \n(2009) are more the consequence of women\u2019s rights than a determinant. \n5\n Boserup (1970) suggests that the relationship might be non-linear with economic development first \nproviding men with preferential access to economic resources, only benefiting women after a threshold \nlevel of economic development has been reached and women start entering the paid workforce. Some \nfeminists even suggest that economic development might increase economic discrimination against \nwomen (Charlton, 1997). In pre-tests we included a squared income term to account for Boserup\u2019s \nhypothesis of non-linear relationship, but did not find it to be statistically significant. For this reason, \nincome enters the estimations reported below only linearly. \n6\n The statistic for computing a fixed-effects ordered logit or probit model is extremely complex, and \nthere does not exist a routine in STATA currently, or to our knowledge at least, any other standard \neconometrics package to estimate such a model. Adding \u201cby hand\u201d country fixed effects to the ordered \nprobit or logit estimator leads to biased coefficients and standard errors (Stata, 2003). \n7\n Is reverse causality likely to represent a problem? Busse and Spielmann (2005) report evidence that a \nhigher gender wage gap promotes the export of labor-intensive goods, whereas the opposite is the case \nfor gender inequality in labor force activity and educational attainment rates. In a country study of \nSouth Korea, Seguino (1997) finds that the gender wage gap can explain some of the country\u2019s growth \nin exports. As concerns FDI, both Kucera (2002) and Busse and Spielmann (2003) find no evidence \nthat greater gender inequality attracts foreign investors. While the existing evidence is thus mixed, we \n 36 \n                                                                                                                                            \ncannot exclude the possibility that higher women\u2019s rights leads to more inward FDI or more trade. \nNote, however, that contrary to our general trade and FDI openness variables, our row-standardized \nspatial lag variables are not affected by this reverse causality if inward FDI from all source countries \nand trade with all partner countries go up similarly in response to higher women\u2019s rights. For the \nspatial lag variables, reverse causality is only an issue if higher domestic women\u2019s rights also affect the \nidentity of foreign trade and investment partners, which we cannot exclude as a possibility. \n8\n In order to provide some concrete examples of how women\u2019s rights have improved in one of the \ncountries mentioned in this section, take Brazil. The 1988 Brazilian Constitution contains \u201csome of the \nmost advanced legislation and innovative mechanisms to advance women\u2019s rights\u201d (Htun, 2002, p. \n736) and while there are many enforcement issues, this progressive legislation was followed by a 1999 \nlaw designed to create incentives to hire more female employees, a change to the civil code in 2001 \nthat grants men and women equality in marriage and a 2002 law that grants adoptive mothers the right \nto maternity leave and benefits (Htun, 2002). In the judgment of Lovell (2006, p. 80), despite many \npersistent problems Brazilian women \u201chave made remarkable progress over the past four decades in \nsecuring hard-won legal rights and in gaining access to the highest levels of schooling, entrance into \nhigher paying occupations, and narrowing the intraethnic gender wage gap\u201d. \n9\n The asymptotic long-term effect \u2013 computed according to Pl\u00fcmper, Troeger & Manow (2005, p. 336) \n\u2013 is ( )6 1\n11 1\nT\nT tit\ntrade\ntikt kt\nk t T\ny\nw y\n\u03b2 \u03b2 \u2212\n=\n\u2212 \u2212\n\u2192\n\u2202\n=\n\u2202 \u2211\u2211\n, where T is sufficiently large (typically fifteen or \nmore). \n10\n We thank an anonymous referee for drawing our attention to this. \n11\n The same holds for general FDI openness, but only for women\u2019s social rights and only in the global \nsample. \n 37 \nTable 1.
