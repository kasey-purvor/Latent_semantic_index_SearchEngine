[DOI: 10.1063\/1.1832748]\nINTRODUCTION\nMemory switching is said to occur when a solid-state\ndevice [metal\u2013semiconductor\u2013metal (MSM) in this case]\nchanges from a highly nonconducting (OFF) state to a highly\nconducting (ON) state accompanied by a change in the de-\nvice resistance over several orders of magnitude. This\nchange remains stable even in the absence of any bias, mak-\ning these devices nonvolatile (memory) switching\ndevices\u2014as opposed to threshold switching devices in which\nthe ON state is maintained only in the presence of a bias. The\ninitial stage when as-deposited devices are switched to the\nON state for the first time is referred to as forming. Though\nthe actual mechanisms of forming (and subsequent switch-\ning) are still unknown, it is thought that a highly conducting\nsemimetallic filament is created through the device during\nforming,1 creating a link between the two metal contacts\nwhich produces the large reduction in the device resistance\nin the ON state. Subsequent switching then occurs by the\nbreaking and recreating of this filament with pulses of lower\nmagnitude than those required for the initial forming process.\nHajto et al.2 give a detailed review of most of the character-\nistics associated with both threshold and memory switching,\nincluding forming. Work on reversible switching has been\ncarried out on a number of materials, starting originally with\nthe chalcogenide glasses,3 to nickel oxides,4 amorphous\nsilicon,5 hydrogenated amorphous silicon,6 and more re-\ncently in hydrogenated amorphous (silicon-rich) silicon\ncarbide.7,8 The forming step is a rather difficult process to\ncontrol but it has been observed that slightly doping the\nsemiconductor film significantly lowers the forming voltage.\nThis is thought to be related to the presence of defect states\nintroduced into the semiconductor film by the doping\nprocess.9 In this work, silicon dangling-bond defect states\nhave been introduced into the semiconductor material by\nbombarding the film with Si+ ions. Ion bombardment has\ndistinct advantages in that the distribution profile and the\ndensity of the induced defects can be controlled with much\nmore ease compared with the previous methods of doping9\nand current stressing.10 This control is achieved by selecting\nappropriate implantation parameters such as dose and energy,\nand it has been observed that ion bombardment of the MSM\nstructures results in more uniform electrical and forming\ncharacteristics.8,11 We use Si+ ions in order to ensure that\nmainly silicon dangling-bond states are introduced without\ndoping the material. The Si dangling-bond defect states will\ntend to pin the Schottky barriers at both MS junctions at a\nwell-defined level, as well as control the minority-carrier\nlifetime and Poole\u2013Frenkel conduction,12 all of which are\ninstrumental in determining how the current flows and the\nenergy is dissipated in the MSM structure during forming\nand switching.\nEXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nIon bombarded hydrogenated amorphous silicon\nsa-Si:Hd MSM devices were fabricated with chromium (Cr)\ntop and bottom contacts. First, a chromium nitride (CrN)\nback contact was deposited onto a glass substrate and the a\n-Si:H semiconductor layer was deposited onto it by the rf-\nglow discharge decomposition of silane sSiH4d in a plasma-\nenhanced chemical-vapor deposition (PECVD) system at\n300 \u00b0C. The thickness of the layer was 50, 70, and 100 nm.\nIon bombardments were made using Si+ ions at energies of\n10, 20, and 40 keV for the 50-, 70-, and 100-nm-thick\nsamples, respectively. The energies were chosen so that the\ninduced defect states were located at approximately the cen-\nters of each of the semiconductor films. Following bombard-\nment, Cr metal contacts were sputtered onto the semiconduc-\ntor film through a mask to give rectangular devices 4.23\n310\u22124 cm2 in area. Forming was achieved by manually\nstressing the MSM devices at the top contact with unipolar\nsingle-shot pulses of mainly 4 ms in length.

These were taken between \u00b10.6 V in increments\nof 0.025 V at a dwell time of 0.001 s. High-voltage I\u2013V\ncharacteristics were obtained by recording current levels at\neach forming voltage on a digital oscilloscope and correcting\nfor the voltage dropped across a 1-kV resistor connected in\nseries with the device to avoid current overshoot.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nFigure 1 shows the I\u2013V characteristics of the unbom-\nbarded a-Si:H devices of varying thicknesses. The charac-\nteristics show a large asymmetry between the positive and\nnegative bias characteristics. This can be seen from the dif-\nference in the current levels at V=0 obtained by extrapola-\ntion of the characteristics. This asymmetry between the posi-\ntive and negative polarities represents an asymmetry in the\nbarrier heights at the two contacts. When a positive voltage\nis applied to the top contact, electrons are ejected from the\nbottom contact while in the case of a negative voltage on the\ntop contact, electrons are ejected from the top contact of the\nMSM structure. The barrier heights sfBd at the two contacts\ncan be estimated from the values of the intercept at V=0.\nFrom Fig. 1, fBT=0.94 eV and fBB=0.79 eV for the top and\nbottom contacts, respectively. This asymmetry in the barrier\nheight is typical of MSM structures grown using PECVD\nwhere it is found that a-Si:H grown on metal gives a differ-\nent barrier height than when depositing a metal on a-Si:H.13\nAfter ion bombardment, the I\u2013V characteristics at low\nfields change markedly (Fig. 2). The magnitude of the cur-\nrent increases and the characteristics are symmetrical at\nabout V=0. This is consistent with current transport through\nthe bulk of the material becoming more dominant compared\nwith current transport over the barriers at each end of the\ndevices, which is the case in the unbombarded devices. It is\nfound that the voltage required for a given current increases\nwith the thickness of the a-Si:H layer. The symmetry of the\ncurves is consistent with the conduction through the bulk of\nthe material via the Poole\u2013Frenkel effect.\nIt is known that ion bombardment at room temperature\nintroduces damage into a-Si:H, which increases the width of\nthe band tails due to an increase in the variation of bond\nangles and bond lengths.14 The increase in the strength of the\nband tails leads to a change in the mobility edge and a re-\nduction in the band gap. There is also a large increase in the\nconcentration of silicon dangling-bond states distributed\nacross the band gap. On annealing above the equilibration\ntemperature s,240 \u00b0Cd, most of these dangling-bond states\nanneal out but there is always some residual damage remain-\ning that depends on the total amount of energy dissipated\nduring the implant and, therefore, on the dose and atomic\nmass of the ion.15 The effect of ion bombardment, therefore,\nis to reduce the Schottky barrier height and provide charged\ndefect states that enable current to flow through the surface\nbarriers via the Poole\u2013Frenkel effect in parallel with the cur-\nrent passing over the barriers via the thermionic-field emis-\nsion. Since ln J is proportional to the square root of the elec-\ntric field sEd for the Poole\u2013Frenkel conduction and to ,E for\nthe thermionic-field emission,16 we expect to see the Poole\u2013\nFrenkel behavior at low fields and thermionic-field emission\nat high fields. Indeed it is possible to see the transition from\none dominant transport mechanism to the other by measuring\nthe activation energy as a function of bias.17\nFigure 3 shows high-field current\u2013voltage sI\u2013Vd charac-\nteristics for both the reference (unbombarded) and bom-\nbarded MSM devices of thickness 50, 70, and 100 nm for\nboth the positive and negative pulses. It can be seen that the\ncurrent for the bombarded devices is higher than that for the\nunbombarded devices\u2014presumably due to the effect of ion\nbombardment in lowering the Schottky barrier height. The\ncurrent for a given field, however, is still lower in the nega-\nFIG. 1. Low-voltage I\u2013V characteristics for unbombarded Cr\/a-Si:H\/Cr\nMSM devices.\nFIG. 2.

We also note that the E1\/2 dependence between\nthe logarithm of the current and electric field seen in Fig. 2 is\nno longer apparent. Since E is proportional to V, Fig. 3\nshows a more linear dependence between log I and E, indica-\ntive of thermionic-field emission. Another significant obser-\nvation from Fig. 3 is that as the voltage pulses of higher\nmagnitudes are applied to the top contact in the positive\ndirection, there seems to be an abrupt rise in the current at\n,6 mA and the current rises almost vertically towards the\ncurrent limit of the stressing kit s,13 mAd. This abrupt rise\nin the current could be indicative of an increase in the device\ntemperature when the current flowing through the device ex-\nceeds ,6 mA, irrespective of the device thickness. This phe-\nnomenon is not seen in the negative direction.\nFigure 4 shows the magnitude of the electric field sEFd\nrequired to form devices of different thicknesses. Devices\nlocated in close proximity to each other on the same 2-in.\nsquare sample were formed using the positive and negative\npulses. For the positive pulses, we see that the average value\nof EF for the bombarded devices is approximately constant at\n1.23108 V m\u22121, independent of thickness. Since current is\ndetermined by thermionic-field emission through the reverse\nbiased Schottky barrier contact and is a function only of the\nelectric field, we assume that a similar amount of current is\nflowing through the devices just prior to forming. In this\ncase, we can assume that the forming process in the positive\ndirection is a function only of current and not power. Inter-\nestingly, the high-field I\u2013V plots shown in Fig. 3 indicate an\nabrupt increase in current at the same point s,6 mAd, in-\ndicative of a rise in device temperature.\nFor pulses with negative bias on the top contact, Fig. 4\nshows that the average field required to form devices\nstrongly depends on thickness of the a-Si:H layer, with\nhigher fields being required for thicker layers. This seems to\nsuggest that in the negative direction, it is power that counts,\nimplying that higher power is required to form the thicker\nsamples and hence the need for the higher voltages in the 70-\nand 100-nm devices. EF is much higher in the thicker\nsamples compared to the EF of the same samples in the posi-\ntive direction.\nThe difference in the forming characteristics observed\nwhen the devices are stressed with the positive or negative\npolarities can be explained by the asymmetry in the structure\nand the differences between the energy deposition mecha-\nnisms at the negative and positive contacts. Since the top\nmetal contact is a defined region while the bottom contact is\ncontinuous (see Fig. 1 inset), it is always easier to heat the\ntop contact because it has better thermal isolation. At the\nbottom contact any heat dissipated during energy deposition\nis lost much more rapidly. We have seen that under the posi-\ntive bias on the top contact, the electric field needed to form\nthe device is independent of the thickness of the a-Si:H,\nsuggesting that the magnitude of the electron current is all\nthat matters. Under high electric fields, this current flows\nthrough the conduction band of the a-Si:H and into the top\nmetal contact [Fig. 5(a)]. Every electron that passes into the\ntop contact will deposit fBT of energy at the metal\u2013\nsemiconductor interface. We assume that when this energy\nreaches a critical level, filament formation begins. Further-\nmore, a high barrier to electrons at the top contact implies a\nlow barrier to holes since their sum equals the band gap. We,\ntherefore, expect holes to be injected at the top contact and\nelectron\u2013hole recombination to occur, further increasing the\nFIG. 3.

This mecha-\nnism explains why the electric field at forming is indepen-\ndent of the thickness of the a-Si:H.\nThe situation when a negative voltage is applied to the\ntop contact is very different [Fig. 5(b)]. This is because only\nelectrons in the metal with energy greater than that of fBT\nflow over the barrier into the a-Si:H thereby cooling the top\ncontact. Energy deposition occurs throughout the a-Si:H and\nparticularly at the bottom contact. We see from Fig. 4 that the\nfield required to form the thinnest devices is comparable un-\nder the positive or negative bias. This can be explained if\nheat generated at the bottom contact during the forming\npulse is transmitted through the semiconductor to the top\ncontact. This heat combined with that generated by dissipa-\ntion in the a-Si:H increases above the critical amount\nneeded for forming via the top contact under the negative\nbias. As the thickness of the a-Si:H increases, transmission\nof heat from the bottom to the top contact becomes less\neffective and an increase in electric field and electron current\nis required to increase the power dissipation in the a-Si:H\nbefore forming occurs. We see, therefore, that the polarity-\ndependent forming can be explained by the asymmetry in the\nheat sinking of the two contacts combined with a difference\nin the energy deposition mechanism between the positively\nand negatively biased contacts.\nCONCLUSIONS\nMeasurements on bombarded MSM devices with differ-\nent thicknesses have shown that forming using positive\npulses is different from forming using negative pulses in\nterms of their field dependence. In the positive direction, the\nelectric field needed to form a MSM device is independent of\nthe thickness of a-Si:H. This indicates that the forming\nmechanism depends only on the magnitude of the current. In\nthe negative direction, EF was observed to be strongly de-\npendent on thickness with thicker samples requiring higher\nfields. This suggests that power, rather than the current flow-\ning through the devices, is more important for forming with\nnegative pulses. A model that explains these polarity differ-\nences is proposed that takes into account the asymmetry of\nthe thermal properties of the two contacts combined with the\nchange in energy deposition at the contacts between negative\nand positive biases. This asymmetry leads to pronounced en-\nergy deposition near the top interface under a positive bias,\nwhich depends only on the magnitude of the current. Under a\nnegative bias, however, the energy deposition is much less\npronounced at the top contact. These differences, combined\nwith the differences in the heat sinking at both contacts, ex-\nplain why it is generally easier to form devices with a posi-\ntive voltage on the top contact when compared with a nega-\ntive voltage.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nWe wish to thank Philips Research Laboratories (UK)\nfor providing funding and the samples used in this work.\n1A.
