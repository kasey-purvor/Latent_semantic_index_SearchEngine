Introduction. This paper is concerned with the small-time behavior of inter-\nfaces of zero contact angle solutions to the \u201cthin-film\u201d equation\n\u2202h\n\u2202t\n= \u2212 \u2202\n\u2202x\n(\nhn\n\u22023h\n\u2202x3\n)\n,(1.1a)\nwith h = h0(x) at t = 0 and(1.1b)\nh =\n\u2202h\n\u2202x\n= hn\n\u22023h\n\u2202x3\n= 0 at x = s(t),(1.1c)\nwhere h \u2265 0 represents the thickness of a fluid film and x = s(t) denotes the right-hand\ninterface (with h \u2261 0 for x > s(t)); since we are concerned with the local behavior at\nsuch an interface we need not specify conditions at any left-hand moving boundary.\nThe first boundary condition of (1.1c) defines the moving boundary (as the point at\nwhich the film thickness reaches zero), the second ensures a zero contact angle, and\nthe third represents conservation of mass.\nIn the last few years the range 0 < n \u2264 3 has been considered in the literature from\na modeling point of view. With n = 3, (1.1a\u2013c) models the lubrication approximation\nof a surface tension-driven thin viscous film spreading on a solid horizontal surface,\nwith a no-slip condition at the solid\/liquid\/air interface [5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 14, 34].\nHowever, the no-slip condition implies an infinite force at the interface [19, 27]. To\navoid this, more realistic models allowing slip have been proposed (see, e.g., [4, 22, 26])\nfor which it has been shown that the qualitative behavior of solutions in the vicinity\nof the interface corresponds to that of the solution of (1.1a\u2013c) with n \u2208 (0, 3); this\napplies to questions of spreading or nonspreading as well as to questions of locally\npreserved positivity and local film rupture [17].

With\nn \u2208 (0, 3) it is also well known (see, e.g., [7, 8]) that (1.1a\u2013c) admits solutions with a\nfinite speed of propagation property; i.e., s(t) represents a moving boundary, which\nmoves at finite speed.\nIn this paper we thus consider only values of n in the moving front regime 0 < n <\n3, and we assume further that the film is thick enough that Van der Waals forces play\nno part. When considering solutions to (1.1a\u2013c), the primary physical question is often\nto do with the movement of the free boundary. Where h = 0 there is no diffusion\nin (1.1a), and this can lead to waiting-time behavior, where the interface remains\nstationary for a period before moving; alternatively the interface may either advance\nor retreat immediately. A determination of the regimes in which such behavior can\noccur has considerable implications regarding the possibility of film rupture in the\npresence of a very thin prewetting layer; see, e.g., [31].\nThere has been much recent effort in the literature to answer outstanding ques-\ntions about the initial movement of the interface. Theoretical results in [4, 5] have\nshown that the interface cannot retreat if n \u2265 3\/2, but that film rupture may occur\nfor n < 1\/2 (see also [13, 14]). Moreover, numerical evidence [4, 10, 12] suggests that\nfor small values of n solutions which are initially strictly positive may vanish at some\npoint x0 after a finite time t0, with the solution becoming zero on a set of positive\nmeasure shortly after the finite time singularity, a phenomenon called \u201cdead core\u201d in\nother fields. The existence of a critical exponent (a value of n\u2217 > 0 for which solutions\nstay positive for n > n\u2217 and where finite-time singularities are possible for n \u2264 n\u2217)\nhas been conjectured in [11], where it is remarked that numerical simulations suggest\n1 < n\u2217 < 3.5. Our results below support and clarify these conjectures; in particular,\nhere we provide the first concrete solutions to (1.1a\u2013c) displaying retreat.\nAs explained in [31], subsequent to any waiting time the local behavior of solutions\nto (1.1a\u2013c) takes the form\nh \u223c\n(\nn3s\u02d9\n3(3\u2212 n)(2n\u2212 3)(s\u2212 x)\n3\n) 1\nn\nas x\u2192 s\u2212 for 3\n2\n< n < 3,(1.2)\nh \u223c\n(\n3\n4\ns\u02d9(s\u2212 x)3 ln\n[\n1\n(s\u2212 x)\n]) 2\n3\nas x\u2192 s\u2212 for n = 3\n2\n,(1.3)\nh \u223c B(t)(s\u2212 x)2 as x\u2192 s\u2212 for n < 3\n2\n.(1.4)\nWith 0 < n < 3, in (1.2) we require that s\u02d9 > 0, whereas in (1.4) the interface velocity\ns\u02d9 may take either sign, with B(t) determined as part of the solution. One of the key\nmotivations for the current analysis is to provide criteria under which s\u02d9 < 0 holds\nfor sufficiently small time; since s\u02d9 > 0 typically holds for large times, for example for\nthe Cauchy problem with initial data of finite mass, a large-time analysis provides no\ninsight into such matters.\nFor definiteness, we shall consider the case\n(1.5) h0(x) \u223c A0(x0 \u2212 x)\u03b1 + C0(x0 \u2212 x)\u03b2 as x\u2192 x\u22120 ,\nwhere A0, \u03b1, and \u03b2 are positive constants with \u03b2 > \u03b1; C0 is a constant; and x0 = s(0).\nExtensive studies of the small-time behavior have already been done for the cor-\nresponding second-order problem, the porous-medium equation:\n(1.6)\n\u2202h\n\u2202t\n=\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n(\nhn\n\u2202h\n\u2202x\n)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCopyright \u00a9 by SIAM.

A summary of the possible small-time behaviors with respect to n and \u03b1. By \u201cshock\u201d\nwe mean that a steep front suddenly overruns the interface. In the region max(2, 3\/n) < \u03b1 < 4\/n\na diverse range of waiting-time scenarios are seen: specifically (see sections 4.4.1 and 4.6.1) the\ninterface waits, but the local profile changes instantaneously from that of the initial data and can\nexhibit monotonic (if \u03b15 < \u03b1 < 4\/n) or oscillatory (if \u03b12 < \u03b1 < \u03b15) decay to the local solution, or\nlimit-cycle behavior (if max(2, 3\/n) < \u03b1 < \u03b12).\nwith n > 0. We present our results in this context. The variety of possible small-\ntime behaviors for (1.1a\u2013c) is summarized in Figure 1.1, and can be characterized as\nfollows:\n(i) For \u03b1 greater than some critical value, the interface \u201cwaits\u201d for some finite\ntime tw, whereby\ns(t) = x0 for 0 \u2264 t \u2264 tw,\nafter which time it moves. (See also [18, 21, 23] for rigorous studies of such\nwaiting-time phenomena for (1.1a).) For \u03b1 = 4\/n an upper bound on tw\ncan be deduced from the local behavior of the solution (cf. [33] for the corre-\nsponding case (1.6)); more generally, information about tw can be obtained\nfrom the full (global) solution (cf. [32] for (1.6)).\n(ii) For \u03b1 below the critical value, the interface will move at once, with (in view\nof (1.2)\u2013(1.3))\ns(t) > x0 for t > 0\nfor 3\/2 \u2264 n < 3 (cf. [25] for (1.6)). For n < 3\/2, however, s\u02d9 < 0 is also\npossible, so a further classification is required according to whether s\u02d9 > 0 or\ns\u02d9 < 0 for small t > 0. This does not arise in the corresponding analysis of\n(1.6), since s\u02d9 \u2265 0 necessarily holds.\nIn addition, the higher order of (1.1a) leads, as we shall see, to a much more diverse\nrange of waiting-time scenarios than that which occurs for (1.6), as shown in Figure 1.1.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCopyright \u00a9 by SIAM.

The cur-\nrent phenomena are associated with perfectly wetting (zero-contact-angle) boundary\nconditions and should not be confused with those associated with finite static contact\nangles. In the latter (i.e., partially wetting) case, for viscous fluids with an initial\ncondition characterized by a contact angle sufficiently greater (respectively, less) than\nequilibrium, the droplet tends to spread (contract) with no waiting. For intermedi-\nate contact angles, waiting-time behavior associated with contact-angle hysteresis can\noccur. Although such behavior has some similarities with that described below (in\nparticular, retreating contact lines are associated with initial data that are \u201csmaller\u201d\nthan advancing ones), there are also important differences, notably that waiting-time\nbehavior is in general associated with the \u201csmallest\u201d initial data.\nWe are not aware of any experimental evidence to support our conjectures, but in\nlight of our results such experiments might be timely. For a discussion of the physical\nlength scales pertinent to the slip-dominated (n = 2) model, see, for example, [20],\nand also references therein regarding such strong slip conditions. (We note that this\npaper also includes an additional term, not present in the thin-film equation, that\nis relevant for slip lengths even longer than those for which (1.1a\u2013c) applies with\nn = 2.) Instead, we support our asymptotic conjectures with numerical results.\nWithout loss of generality we assume that s(0) > 0 and, for numerical purposes, we\nfirst approximate (1.1a\u2013c) by replacing (1.1c) by\n(1.7c)\n\u2202h\n\u2202x\n= hn\n\u22023h\n\u2202x3\n= 0 for x = 0, l,\nwhere l \b s(0), and restrict (1.1a) to hold on (0, l). Existence of solution concepts\nfor (1.1a,b), (1.7c) may be found in [5, 9, 14] and the references cited therein.\nAs described in [2], we discretize (1.1a,b), (1.7c) using finite elements in space and\nfinite differences in time, using uniform spatial and temporal discretization parameters\n\u03b4x and \u03b4t, respectively; see section 2 for details. We expect that this method will be\nable to compute the zero contact angle solution for the following reasons:\n1. In [5], the existence of solutions to (1.1a,b), (1.7c) is proved for 0 < n < 3,\nwhere h(\u00b7, t) may be C1([0, l]) for almost every t > 0 (the zero contact angle\nsolution), or alternatively h(\u00b7, t) may have nonexpansive support.\n2. In [2] it was proved that the numerical solution converges, as \u03b4x, \u03b4t \u2192 0,\nto a weak solution of (1.1a,b), (1.7c) (in the sense of [5, 9, 14]). The only\nremaining question is whether this is the zero contact angle solution or a\nsolution with nonexpansive support.\n3. In a sequence of experiments, taking \u03b4t = O(\u03b4x\n1\n2 ), the numerical method\ncomputes a solution with nonexpansive support.\n4. In a sequence of experiments, taking \u03b4t = O(\u03b4x2), the numerical method can\ncompute solutions where |s\u02d9(0)| =\u221e (zero contact angle solutions).\n5. In [2] a self-similar source type solution was successfully computed with\n\u03b4t = O(\u03b4x2). Moreover, taking a nonsmooth stationary solution as ini-\ntial data, i.e., h0(x) = \u03b1max{\u03b32 \u2212 x2, 0} and 0 < \u03b3 < l, the numerical\nmethod computed a smooth solution for 0 < n < 3, and it was concluded\nthat h(x, t) \u2261 h0(x) for n > 3.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCopyright \u00a9 by SIAM.

KING, AND STEPHEN LANGDON\nHence in our experiments, in order to be sure that we are approximating the zero\ncontact angle solution we always choose \u03b4t = O(\u03b4x2). We report that the numerical\nsolution always appears to be smooth.\nAn outline of the paper is as follows. We begin in section 2 by describing\nour numerical scheme in more detail. We then proceed in sections 3 and 4 with a\nformal asymptotic analysis, supported by numerical experiments, for the two cases\n\u03b1 \u2265 4\/n and \u03b1 < 4\/n, respectively.

Finally,\nin section 5 we present some conclusions.\n2. Numerical approximation. Following the approach of [2], and as described\nin section 1, we restrict (1.1a) to a finite space interval (0, l), introduce a potential w,\nand rewrite it as the system of equations\n\u2202h\n\u2202t\n=\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n(\nhn\n\u2202w\n\u2202x\n)\nin (0, l)\u00d7 (0, T ),(2.1a)\n\u2212 \u2202\n2h\n\u2202x2\n= w in (0, l)\u00d7 (0, T ).(2.1b)\nA nonnegativity constraint is imposed on (2.1b) via a variational inequality in the\nweak form, and then we discretize (2.1a,b) using the finite element method. Now,\ngiven positive integers N and M , denote by \u03b4t := T\/M and \u03b4x := l\/N the tempo-\nral and spatial discretization parameters, tk := k\u03b4t, k = 1, . . . ,M , and xj = j\u03b4x,\nj = 0, . . . , N ; then the discretization may be written in the following way.\nFor k = 1, . . . ,M and j = 1, . . . , N \u2212 1 find {Hk+1j ,W k+1j } such that\nHk+1j \u2212Hkj\n\u03b4t\n+\n1\n\u03b4x2\n[\u222b xj\nxj\u22121\n(\n(x\u2212 xj\u22121)\n\u03b4x\nHkj +\n(xj \u2212 x)\n\u03b4x\nHkj\u22121\n)n\ndx\n](\nW k+1j \u2212W k+1j\u22121\n\u03b4x\n)\n+\n1\n\u03b4x2\n[\u222b xj+1\nxj\n(\n(x\u2212 xj)\n\u03b4x\nHkj+1 +\n(xj+1 \u2212 x)\n\u03b4x\nHkj\n)n\ndx\n](\nW k+1j \u2212W k+1j+1\n\u03b4x\n)\n= 0,(2.2a)\n[\n\u2212Hk+1j+1 + 2Hk+1j \u2212Hk+1j\u22121\n\u03b4x2\n\u2212W k+1j\n]\nHk+1j = 0,(2.2b)\n\u2212Hk+1j+1 + 2Hk+1j \u2212Hk+1j\u22121\n\u03b4x2\n\u2212W k+1j \u2265 0,(2.2c)\nHk+1j \u2265 0,(2.2d)\nwhere Hkj \u2248 h(xj , tk), W kj \u2248 w(xj , tk), H0j = h0(xj); similar equations\/inequalities\nappropriate for boundary data (1.7c) hold for j = 0, N when k = 1, . . . ,M . This non-\nlinear system is solved using a Gauss\u2013Seidel algorithm in multigrid mode; for details\nwe refer to [3]. We found this approach to have several advantages over some other\nalgorithms previously proposed in the literature, such as the Uzawa-type algorithm\n[2, (3.7a\u2013c)], [24]. Specifically, we find the following:\n1. If Hkj\u22121 = H\nk\nj = H\nk\nj+1 = 0, then it follows from (2.2a) that H\nk+1\nj = H\nk\nj = 0,\nso that the free boundary advances at most one mesh point from time level k\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCopyright \u00a9 by SIAM.

The advantage of using the nonsymmetric Gauss\u2013Seidel\nsmoother is that this constraint is easier to impose on the numerical method\nthan with a symmetric smoother.\n2. Working within a multigrid framework significantly increases the rate of con-\nvergence. This allows us to reduce the tolerance for the stopping criterion of\nthe iterative scheme (the maximum absolute difference in successive iterates\nis smaller than tol) to tol = 10\u221212, as compared with tol = 10\u22128 in [2], and\ntherefore to solve the nonlinear system more accurately, thereby helping to\navoid spurious behavior.\n3. Nonnegativity of the computed numerical solution is guaranteed, and so defin-\ning the position xkc of the numerical free boundary at time tk to be\nxkc := {xj > 0 : Hkm \u2264 \u0007 for all m \u2265 j, Hkj\u22121 > \u0007},\nwe take \u0007 = 0, which tracks the free boundary more accurately than with\n\u0007 > 0; this compares with \u0007 = 10\u22126 in [2]. We remark that because the\nnumerical free boundary is defined on a discrete set of points, its movement\nappears to \u201cstutter\u201d in the figures below. Although the interface always\nadvances or retreats with a stepping motion, oscillations are seen only in\ncertain cases. Moreover, it is sometimes the case that the oscillations in Hkj\nbegin and grow before the contact line moves; hence they do not appear to\nbe caused by this \u201cstuttering.\u201d\nIn the numerical experiments of sections 3 and 4 we solve (1.1a,b), (1.7c) with\nl = 1 and\n(2.3) h0(x) = 5max\n{(\n9\n16 \u2212 x2\n)\u03b1\n, 0\n}\n;\nthe key properties are that the maximum value of h0 is O(1) and the thin film is\nsymmetrically distributed about 0 with x0 = 3\/4. These experiments were performed\nfor a sequence of space steps \u03b4x, where \u03b4t = C\u03b1,n\u03b4x\n2 and convergence of (2.2a)\u2013(2.2d)\nto a weak solution of (1.1a,b), (1.7c), (2.3) was assured (see [2]). For reasons of space\nwe refer to [15] for further figures and numerical results, including results from many\nmore experiments with values of n and \u03b1 closer to the edges of the parameter regimes.\n3. Formal asymptotic analysis and numerical results for \u03b1 \u2265 4\/n. For\n\u03b1 \u2265 4\/n, the formal asymptotic analysis of this section suggests that we might expect\nwaiting-time behavior. In particular, for \u03b1 > 4\/n (section 3.1) we anticipate \u201cglobal\u201d\nwaiting-time behavior, by which we mean that the asymptotic expansion tells us\nto expect a waiting time but gives no clue as to the local behavior; in this case\nthe interface starts to move due to shock formation, with the gradient becoming\nunbounded near the free boundary. For \u03b1 = 4\/n (section 3.2) this global breakdown\ncan occur for the full range 0 < n < 3, but for 2 < n < 3 \u201clocal\u201d waiting-time\nbehavior is also possible; by this we mean that the dominant term in the asymptotic\nexpansion switches at the end of the waiting time.\n3.1. \u03b1 > 4\/n: Global waiting-time behavior.

The numerical free boundary remains stationary for a period\nbefore advancing. We also plot profiles of Hkj in the vicinity of the interface at times\njust before and just after xkc begins to move (lower left panel). Shock-type behavior\nat the end of the waiting time can be observed (cf. [32] for the second-order case).\nSimilar waiting-time behavior, with shock type behavior at the end of the waiting\ntime, was observed for all n, \u03b1 combinations tested in this range. Approximate waiting\ntimes are plotted against \u03b1 in the right half of Figure 3.1, for n = 0.75, 1.0, 1.75, 2.5\nand for various \u03b1 > 4\/n.

Thus for 2 < n < 3 local waiting-time behavior (tw =\ntc) is possible, analogous to that for the porous-medium equation [33], while global\nbreakdown (tw < tc for 2 < n < 3) can occur for the full range 0 < n < 3 (cf. [32]).\n4. Formal asymptotic analysis and numerical results for \u03b1 < 4\/n. We\nbegin in section 4.1 by deriving some local similarity solutions. Based on these and\nthe local behavior indicated in (1.2)\u2013(1.4), we conjecture in sections 4.2\u20134.6 some\nparameter regimes for the small-time behavior when \u03b1 < 4\/n, in which case (3.3)\nfails for any t > 0. This does not mean that for \u03b1 < 4\/n there is no waiting-time\nbehavior; on the contrary, unlike for the corresponding second-order problem (1.6),\na diverse range of waiting-time scenarios can occur in this case. In addition to these\nwaiting-time scenarios, the front may also advance or retreat instantaneously. Many\nof our conjectures are supported by extensive numerical verifications, detailed below;\nwe leave open their rigorous confirmation.\n4.1. Local similarity solutions. In view of (1.5), a natural conjecture for the\nsmall-time behavior for \u03b1 < 4\/n (balancing the terms in the expansion so that they\nare of the same size) is the self-similar form\n(4.1) h \u223c t \u03b14\u2212n\u03b1 f\n(\n(x\u2212 x0)\/t 14\u2212n\u03b1\n)\n, s(t) \u223c x0 + \u03b70t 14\u2212n\u03b1 ,\nwhere with \u03b7 := (x\u2212 x0)\/t1\/(4\u2212n\u03b1), f(\u03b7) satisfies the boundary-value problem\n(4.2)\n1\n4\u2212 n\u03b1\n(\n\u03b1f \u2212 \u03b7df\nd\u03b7\n)\n= \u2212 d\nd\u03b7\n(\nfn\nd3f\nd\u03b73\n)\n,\nas \u03b7 \u2192 \u2212\u221e, f \u223c A0(\u2212\u03b7)\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b1(\u03b1\u2212 1)(\u03b1\u2212 2)((n+ 1)\u03b1\u2212 3)An+10 (\u2212\u03b7)(n+1)\u03b1\u22124,(4.3a)\nat \u03b7 = \u03b70, f =\ndf\nd\u03b7\n= fn\nd3f\nd\u03b73\n= 0.(4.3b)\nHere s(t) is the position of the interface at time t, and \u03b70 is a free constant determined\nby the boundary-value problem.\nThe behavior as \u03b7 \u2192 \u2212\u221e in (4.3a) thereby matches via (3.1) with the leading\nterms in (1.5) and (3.2).

Nevertheless, the\ncomplexities of the resulting four-dimensional phase space mean that a global analysis\nof (4.2) (akin to that in [33] for the second-order problem) is not practicable here.\nInstead we base our conjectures in large part on a number of closed-form solutions\nto (4.2), which we now note.

Note the different time scales on the two plots.\nIn the lower half of Figure 4.1 we test the hypothesis that for small times\n(4.11) xkc = x\n0\nc +At\n\u03b3\nk ,\nfor some constants A > 0 and \u03b3, by plotting log(xkc \u2212 x0c) against log tk (as a discrete\nset of points\u2014these appear to \u201cstutter\u201d since the numerical free boundary advances\nby one discrete mesh point at a time). If the hypothesis is correct, we expect a\nstraight line with slope \u03b3. To estimate the value of \u03b3 we take a least squares fit. For\npresentational purposes we plot the best fitting least squares line as a solid line, and\nfor comparison we also plot a dotted line with slope (4 \u2212 n\u03b1)\u22121, the expected value\nof \u03b3 (recall (4.1)).\nFor \u03b1 = 0.5 the log-log plot is fairly straight, and the estimated value of \u03b3 = 0.31\nis close to the expected value of 0.36. For \u03b1 = 1.4 the best fitting least squares line\ngives an estimate of \u03b3 = 1.27, which is not close to the expected value of 2.00 and is a\npoor fit to the data. In this case the immediate yet slow advance of the free boundary\nmeans that, for tk small, x\nk\nc overestimates the exact position of the free boundary.\nThis is demonstrated by the fact that the lowest horizontal line of dots on the log-log\nplot, corresponding to the first step in the advance of xkc , matches very poorly with\nthe rest of the data. In the lower right plot of Figure 4.1 we thus also show as a\ndashed line the best fitting least squares approximation to the data with the first step\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCopyright \u00a9 by SIAM.

This dashed line, with a slope of 1.69, matches the slope of the\ndata and the expected value of \u03b3 much more closely than our original estimate.\nThe expected and estimated values of \u03b3 for each value of \u03b1 tested are shown in\nTable 4.1. For \u03b1 \u2264 1.3 we estimate \u03b3 using all of the data, but for \u03b1 = 1.4 and\n\u03b1 = 1.5 we exclude the first step in the advance of xkc , as discussed above. The\nnumerical results give a value of \u03b3 slightly lower than the expected value, but the\ndifference is small, and the trend of \u03b3 increasing with \u03b1 is clear. Our estimate for \u03b3\nis more accurate for values of \u03b1 away from the edges of the parameter regime.\n4.3. Small-time behavior for n = 2. The behavior for \u03b1 < 2 is as described\nin section 4.2. However, for \u03b1 = 2 the solution (4.1) is not applicable and, partly\nbecause \u03b1 = 2 will also play an important role in what follows, additional comments\nregarding the resulting waiting-time scenario are instructive. The small-time solution\n(4.5) suggests that there is initially no change in local behavior, while (3.2) becomes\n(4.12)\nd\ndx\n(\nhn0\nd3h0\ndx3\n)\n\u223c (\u03b2 + 1)\u03b2(\u03b2 \u2212 1)(\u03b2 \u2212 2)A20C0(x0 \u2212 x)\u03b2t;\nboth suggest seeking a local solution of the form\n(4.13) h \u223c A0(x0 \u2212 x)2 +H(x, t) as x\u2192 x\u22120 ;\nwe note that H need not be positive on x < x0 because it represents a correction term\nto the (quadratic) leading order behavior. Linearizing in H yields\n\u2202H\n\u2202t\n= \u2212A20\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n(\n(x0 \u2212 x)4 \u2202\n3H\n\u2202x3\n)\n,\nand so, given (1.5) in which \u03b2 > 2 is required, the correction term takes the separable\nform\nH = C0(x0 \u2212 x)\u03b2 exp\n(\u2212(\u03b2 + 1)\u03b2(\u03b2 \u2212 1)(\u03b2 \u2212 2)A20t) ,\nconsistent with (3.1), (4.12). The perturbation to the quadratic term thus decays\nexponentially, and we expect (4.13) to persist up to some finite waiting time, after\nwhich the interface will start to move due to shock formation (as in other global\nwaiting-time cases described here; see [32] for the second-order analogue).\n4.4. Small-time behavior for 3\/2 < n < 2. In this case (4.6) again has\nthe expected interface behavior (1.2), while (4.5) is nongeneric in the sense that it\nis smoother than (1.2) at the interface; the solution of (4.2)\u2013(4.3a,b) for \u03b1 = 2 is\ntherefore an exceptional connection in phase space and can be expected to play a role\nin separating distinct regimes, as we now suggest. The other noteworthy change to\noccur as n drops below two is that the local behavior (4.4) can come into play.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCopyright \u00a9 by SIAM.

Moreover, for \u03b15 < \u03b1 < 4\/n we expect\nnonoscillatory decay, whereas for \u03b12 < \u03b1 < \u03b15 we expect damped oscillations to\noccur. See Appendix A for details. For 2 < \u03b1 < \u03b12 the behavior is slightly more\nsubtle, with a limit cycle (see (A.5) of Appendix A) arising in the local description\nfor 0 < t < tw; the limiting behavior as \u03b1\u2192 2 is addressed in Appendix B, providing\nadditional support for conjectures about the (rather subtle) asymptotic behavior.\nWe present numerical results for n = 1.75 (giving 3\/n = 1.7143, \u03b12(n) = 2.0768,\n\u03b15(n) = 2.2, 4\/n = 2.2857), and for \u03b1 = 2.24, 2.10 and 2.04, thus covering each of the\nthree parameter regimes described above. In the upper left plots of Figures 4.2, 4.3,\nand 4.4, we plot xkc against tk for n = 1.75 and \u03b1 = 2.24, 2.10, and 2.04, respectively.\nIn each case xkc remains stationary for a period before advancing, with the length of\nthe waiting period appearing to decrease as \u03b1 decreases. We also plot in each figure\nprofiles of Hkj near the interface at various times while the free boundary is stationary\n(upper right plot) and just as the free boundary is beginning to advance (lower left\nplot). In each case as x \u2192 x\u22120 the profile of Hkj appears to remain unchanged for\na short waiting period. In the lower right plot of each figure we plot logHkj against\nlog(0.75 \u2212 xj) in the vicinity of the free boundary at the same times and using the\nsame legend as in the upper right plot of each figure, plotting also a dotted line with\nslope 4\/n for comparison.\nFor \u03b1 = 2.24 (Figure 4.2) the (nearly) straight lines with slopes 2.26 for tk =\n2.5\u00d7 10\u22124 and 2.29 for tk = 5.0\u00d7 10\u22124 (estimated as before) compare well with the\nvalue of 4\/n = 2.29 proposed in the conjecture.

Such behavior represents\na novel waiting-time phenomenon for degenerate parabolic equations (there being no\ncorresponding scenario for the porous-medium equation), but there are similarities\nwith, for example, Hele\u2013Shaw flows with suction, whereby the free surface profile can\ninstantly change to a new configuration (cf. (4.27)), which then persists (see [29]).\nAnalysis of cases with \u03ba = 0 requires specification of an additional term in the\nlocal (1.5), and remarkably fine structure arises in consequence.

Because it is overspecified, the local\nexpansion of (4.29) pertains only when the local form of the initial data is consistent\nwith the powers of x0 \u2212 x therein and, as already implied, it represents a borderline\nbetween solutions of the form (1.2) and (4.14).\n4.4.3. \u03b1 < 2. Here the interface advances immediately, with f(\u03b7) having local\nbehavior (4.10) and with unbounded initial velocity for \u03b1 < 3\/n, finite for \u03b1 = 3\/n,\nand tending to zero for 3\/n < \u03b1 < 2. The last of these ranges disappears as n drops\nbelow 3\/2, providing one indication of the need to address this regime separately.\nTo test this we ran numerical experiments for n = 1.75 (giving 3\/n = 1.7143,\n4\/n = 2.2857), with \u03b1 \u2208 [0.5, 1.9]. Our results again support the conjecture. In each\ncase xkc advances, with the speed of the advance decreasing as \u03b1 increases. This is\nshown in Figure 4.5, in which xkc is plotted against tk for n = 1.75 with \u03b1 = 0.5, 0.6,\n0.7, and 0.8 (upper left plot) and \u03b1 = 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, and 1.9 (lower left plot). Note the\ndifferent time scales on the two axes.\nIn the upper right plot of Figure 4.5 we show the numerical free boundary\nadvancing for n = 1.75 and \u03b1 = 1.0 < 3\/n. As before, we test the hypothesis (4.11) by\nplotting log tk against log(x\nk\nc \u2212x0c) (in the lower right plot), and we estimate \u03b3 = 0.43.\nFor comparative purposes we plot a dotted line with slope (4\u2212 n\u03b1)\u22121 = 0.44 on the\nsame graph. The expected and estimated values of \u03b3 are shown in Table 4.2. For\n\u03b1 = 1.9 we exclude the first step in the advance of xkc , as discussed in section 4.2.\nThe estimates for \u03b3 are very close to the expected values, with this being especially\ntrue for values of \u03b1 away from the edges of the parameter regime.\n4.5.

KING, AND STEPHEN LANGDON\nwhere \u03c6\u221e is again to be determined as part of the solution and we have matched with\n(4.31). The preexponential factor \u03c1(t) is expected to be algebraic in t; its calculation\nwould require correction terms in the various expansions to be evaluated and we shall\nnot pursue such matters further. Applying arguments similar to those in section 4.4.2,\nwe obtain from (4.32) that\n(4.33) lnh \u223c \u22122\u03bec|\u03b60|\n\u03b2\u22122\n\u03b2\u22121 \/(x0 \u2212 x)\n\u03b2\u22122\n\u03b2\u22121 for \u03c3 < x < x0,\nso the height of the film left behind by the retreating interior layer at x = \u03c3 is\nexponentially small (and thus in particular implies waiting-time behavior at x = x0).\nThis reflects the status of n = 3\/2 as a critical case; as we shall shortly see, for n < 3\/2\nthe interface x = s itself retreats in the corresponding regime (in other words, the film\nthickness left behind x = \u03c3 drops from being algebraically small for 3\/2 < n < 2, as\nin (4.27), through exponentially small for n = 3\/2 (see (4.33)) to zero for n < 3\/2).\n4.6. Small-time behavior for n < 3\/2. We have already alluded to the\nqualitatively new feature, implicit in the local behavior (1.4), which can occur in\nthis regime, namely that the interface can retreat. Such behavior is most simply\ndemonstrated by the case \u03b1 = 3\/n in which the small-time similarity solution is given\nby (4.6), with the interface retreating at a finite rate; in this regime (4.6) is nongeneric,\nbeing smoother than the expected local behavior (1.4). For \u03b1 > 3\/n, we anticipate\nwaiting-time behavior, as in section 4.4.1; see also Appendix A. (In addition, an\nanalysis similar to that of Appendix B can be performed in the limit \u03b1 \u2192 (3\/n)+.)\nThe result for \u03b1 = 3\/n and \u03b1 = 2 suggests that for \u03b1 < 2 the interface expands at an\nunbounded rate, with\n(4.34) f(\u03b7) \u223c \u03b2(\u03b70 \u2212 \u03b7)2 as \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b7\u22120\nfor some constant \u03b70, while for 2 < \u03b1 < 3\/n contraction occurs at an unbounded\nrate, with \u03b70 < 0 in (4.34). The critical case \u03b1 = 2 is again of particular interest,\nin particular since waiting-time behavior can in principle occur in this case also (but\nonly for extremely special initial data; cf. (4.29)). The analysis for \u03b1 = 2 is more\nstraightforward than that above, since (4.22)\u2013(4.24a\u2013c) now apply right up to the\ninterface for C0\u03ba < 0 (retreat) as well as for C0\u03ba > 0 (advance). Such behavior\ncan be illustrated by the explicit solution (4.7)\u2013(4.9) for n = 1, wherein \u03b2 = 3 and\n\u03ba = \u221215.\nFor \u03b1 = 2 we have that\ns(t) \u223c x0 + \u03b60t\n\u03b2\u22121\n4\u22122n as t\u2192 0+,\nwhich exhibits the same interface time-dependence as (4.1) with \u03b1 = (4(\u03b2 \u2212 2) +\n2n)\/((\u03b2 \u2212 1)n); since \u03b2 > 2, it follows that this \u03b1 lies in the range 2 < \u03b1 < 4\/n,\nand it implies that the same s(t) can result from quite different initial data (in this\ncase for 2 < \u03b1 < 3\/n, for which the interface retreats). This reflects the high order\nof (1.1a), whereby the local behavior at the interface contains a further degree of\nfreedom in addition to s(t) and contrasts with the situation for the second-order case\n(1.6) (cf.

In Figures 4.10 and 4.12, the\nlog-log plots are not very straight, and the best fitting least squares lines have slopes\nsignificantly lower than 4\/n.\nIn the lower right corners of Figures 4.6, 4.8, 4.10 and 4.12 we plot logHkj against\nlog(xkc\u2212xj) over the whole range xj \u2208 [0, xkc ) at various times before the free boundary\nhas begun to advance, plotting again a dotted line with slope 4\/n for comparison. In\nFigure 4.6, as tk increases, the log-log plot becomes less and less straight, and for\ntk = 3.0\u00d7 10\u22123 the periodic behavior of the solution near the interface can clearly be\nseen. The log-log plots for tk = 4.0\u00d710\u22123 and tk = 5.0\u00d710\u22123 are very similar to that\nfor tk = 3.0 \u00d7 10\u22123 but are not shown here. In Figure 4.8, the formation of humps\nfurther and further from the free boundary becomes apparent. For tk = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22124,\nthe slope of the log-log plot away from the free boundary is close to 4\/n. For each of\nFigures 4.10 and 4.12, as tk increases, the formation of extra humps in the vicinity of\nthe free boundary becomes apparent.\n4.6.2. 2 < \u03b1 < 3\/n. To test the conjecture that the free boundary retreats\ninstantaneously with unbounded velocity, we ran experiments with n = 1.0 and \u03b1 \u2208\n[2.1, 2.9]. We plot xkc against tk in the left panel of Figure 4.14 for \u03b1 = 2.2, 2.4, 2.6,\nand 2.8. The results support the conjecture. In each case the free boundary retreats,\nwaits, and then advances, although the subsequent advance can only be seen in the\nfigure for \u03b1 = 2.2. The initial velocity of xkc appears to decrease as \u03b1 increases,\nalthough as \u03b1 increases, the length of the period for which the free boundary retreats\nalso increases, so that the maximum distance retreated occurs for \u03b1 = 2.9.\nAs before we test the hypothesis xkc = x\n0\nc \u2212 At\u03b3k for some constants A > 0 and \u03b3\nby plotting log(x0c\u2212xkc ) against log tk.

Conclusions. As we have seen, the thin-film equation (1.1a) exhibits a much\nbroader range of small-time phenomena than its second-order analogue, (1.6). Thus,\nwhile the behavior of the former with 2 < n < 3 corresponds very closely to that\nof the latter with any n > 0, for n < 2 equation (1.1a) exhibits a range of \u03b1 in\nwhich the interface waits but the local profile changes instantaneously from that of\nthe initial data (this combination does not occur for (1.6)) and can exhibit monotonic\nor oscillatory decay to the local solution (4.14) or limit-cycle behavior of the form\n(A.5). Moreover, for n < 3\/2 fronts can either advance or retreat, and our small-time\nclassification gives rather precise criteria on the initial data in this regard. The very\ndelicate interlacing of initial profiles leading to immediate expansion or to a finite\nwaiting time, as outlined in section 4.4.2, for example, also deserves highlighting.\nIn Table 5.1 we demonstrate how these results apply to the cases n = 1 (which de-\nscribes thin films in a Hele\u2013Shaw cell [16] and the strong-slip limit of the Greenspan [22]\nslip regularization) and n = 2 (which corresponds to the strong-slip limit of the usual\n(Navier) slip-regularization; see [26], for example). See also [34] for further relevant\nbackground. It is noteworthy that the case n = 2 is a critical one in a number of\nrespects (some of which are implicit in Figure 1.1).\nThe high-order problem (1.1) is a demanding one from the numerical point of\nview; this wealth of distinct behaviors occurring over short length and time scales\nnecessitates particularly refined, careful, and detailed computational studies if the\nrelevant phenomena are to be captured adequately, and we have sought to implement\nthe required program of extensive numerical investigations. Taking into account the\ndelicacy of some of the asymptotic results and the limitations of the numerical scheme,\nnumerical results are shown only for those parameter regimes wide enough that suit-\nable \u201cintermediate\u201d values of n and \u03b1 can be used.\nA number of generalizations immediately suggest themselves. In higher dimen-\nsions, the small-time behavior of an initially smooth interface will be locally one-\ndimensional, so most of the conclusions carry over. For n \u2265 3, the smoothest solutions\nhave fixed interfaces, and here waiting-time phenomena relate (for 3 \u2264 n < 4) to a\ndelay in the contact angle becoming finite; we shall not elaborate on such matters\nTable 5.1\nSmall- and waiting-time behavior for n = 1 and n = 2.\nn Range of \u03b1 Behavior\n1 4\/n = 4 < \u03b1 Global waiting-time, ended by shock.\n\u03b15 \u2248 3.7 < \u03b1 < 4 Interface waits but local profile changes\ninstantaneously from that of initial data and can\nexhibit monotonic decay to local solution.\n\u03b12 \u2248 3.2 < \u03b1 < 3.7 As above, but with oscillatory decay.\n3\/n = 3 < \u03b1 < 3.2 As above, but with limit cycle behavior.\n2 < \u03b1 < 3 Interface retreats instantaneously.\n\u03b1 > 2 Interface advances instantaneously.\n2 4\/n = 2 \u2264 \u03b1 Global waiting time, ended by shock.\n\u03b1 < 2 Free boundary advances instantaneously.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCopyright \u00a9 by SIAM.

However, for \u0007 > 0 the expression (B.4) is\nreplaced by\n(B.5) g0 = A0(\u2212\u03be0 \u2212 \u03be)2, \u03be0 = 1\n2\n\u03bcA\nn\n2(2\u2212n)\n0 ,\nand (recalling that the interface cannot contract for n > 3\/2) the inner-inner scalings\nread \u03be = \u2212\u03bec(\u0007) + \u00072(2\u2212n)\/(2n\u22123)\u03b6, g = \u00074(2\u2212n)\/(2n\u22123)h(\u03b6), where \u03bec(0) = \u03be0 and\n\u2212 1\n2(2\u2212 n)\u03be0(h0 \u2212H\u221e) = h\nn\n0\nd3h0\nd\u03b63\n,(B.6a)\nas \u03b6 \u2192 \u2212\u221e, h0 \u223c A0(\u2212\u03b6)2,(B.6b)\nas \u03b6 \u2192\u221e, h0 \u2192 H\u221e,(B.6c)\nwhich determines both h0 (up to translations in \u03b6) and H\u221e, the decay of h0 to H\u221e\nbeing nonoscillatory.

The scaling properties of (B.6a\u2013c) show that\nh0 and H\u221e scale with A\n2\/(2\u2212n)\n0 and \u03b6 with A\nn\/(2(2\u2212n))\n0 , so we may rewrite (B.7) as\n(B.8) h \u223c \u03bd(n)A0(\u2212\u03be)2.\nNow setting\n(B.9) f = \u03bd\n2\n2\u2212n \u0007\n8\n2n\u22123 f\u0302 , \u03b7 = \u03bd\nn\n2(2\u2212n) \u0007\n2n\n2n\u22123 \u03b7\u0302,\nwe have that\nf\u0302 \u223c A0(\u2212\u03b7\u0302)2 + \u0007f1(\u03b7\u0302),\nwhere f1 satisfies (B.2a\u2013c) with \u03b7 replaced by \u03b7\u0302, implying that the above structure\nrepeats itself on a sequence of finer and finer scales, consistent with the limit cycle\nbehavior referred to in Appendix A. Thus if we denote the variables in the mth\nmember of the sequence by f (m), \u03b7(m) with f (0) = f and \u03b7(0) = \u03b7, we have from (B.9)\nthat\nf (m) \u223c \u03bd 22\u2212n \u0007 82n\u22123 f (m\u22121), \u03b7(m) \u223c \u03bd n2(2\u2212n) \u0007 2n2n\u22123 \u03b7(m\u22121),\nimplying that\nf (m)(\u03b7) \u223c \u03bd 2m2\u2212n \u0007 8m2n\u22123 f\n(\n\u03b7\n\u03bd\nmn\n2(2\u2212n) \u0007\n2mn\n2n\u22123\n)\n,\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCopyright \u00a9 by SIAM.
