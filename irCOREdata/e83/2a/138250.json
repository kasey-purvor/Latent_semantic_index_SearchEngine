In consequence, the role of hierarchy has come under close\nscrutiny. How can organisations balance the need for congruence, provided through\nhierarchy, with the need for greater organisational democracy? As yet, the potential\nfor management education and learning to impact on this debate at either an\norganisational or societal level, has been largely unfulfilled. In this paper we argue\nthat the aspirational values of liberal adult educationalists have a significant\ncontribution to make to the management of contemporary organisations. We position\nthese values alongside the business requisites that shape organisations and\nexamine the motivations of senior managers to apply these ideas in practice. The\nconcept of voluntarism, derived from the field of political philosophy, is proposed as\nan alternative organisational binding mechanism that alters the rationale for the role\nof hierarchy. The implications for senior executives and management educationalists\nare considered.\nKey words: adult education, hierarchy, organisational democracy, voluntarism.\n3Reconciling hierarchy and democracy: The Value of Management\nLearning\nThe economic and technological transformations of the past twenty years are\nbelieved to have had a profound effect on organisational form (Sparrow and Cooper,\n1998, Cohen 1999). It is frequently argued that there has been a movement of power\naway from the possessors of tangible assets towards power derived from the\nownership of knowledge and information (see, for example, Stewart 1997; Child and\nMcGrath 2002). Whether or not these \u2018new\u2019 organisational stakeholders really only\nserve shareholder interests, as ever, or are \u2018owners\u2019 in their own right, is a secondary\nquestion for most practical purposes. The redistribution of power has established\npluralistic organisations, where stakeholders hold a diversity of conceptions about\norganisational purpose, organising and intended outcomes (Huzzard and \u04e6stergren\n2002), as an indisputable reality for senior managers (Cludts 1999). In these\ncircumstances, the central role of hierarchy in organisations has come under close\nscrutiny.\nThis dispersal of power, and the attendant move towards greater organisational\ndemocratisation, has required management to reconsider the problem of securing\nemployee commitment (Sparrow and Cooper 1998). Attention has focused in\nparticular on the grand design of organisational vision, values, and culture\nmechanisms that supposedly operate as binding agents in lieu of hierarchical control.\nOn the face of it, these design features allow empowerment to coexist with unity of\norganisational purpose. However, the success of such effort to liberalise the work\nplace has been limited in practice (Heller, 1998, Argyris 1998). Some argue that this\nis because managers are still working from a perspective that values unity and\n4control over plurality (see for example, Cloke and Goldsmith 2002). But more\nfundamentally still, initiatives both to liberate and secure commitment through the\ndesign of organisational culture appear more like coercion if an individual\u2019s ability to\n\u2018live the values\u2019 is then subject to appraisal and enforcement (Willmott 1993, 2003,\nRobertson and Swan 2003, Gabriel 1999).\nHow, then, can organisations balance the need for congruence, in terms of shared\nwork processes and purposes, with the need for greater organisational democracy in\nwhich there is \u2018voice\u2019 and the opportunity to act autonomously? For without the latter\nas prerequisites, the ability to innovate, challenge and respond rapidly are greatly\nreduced (Ashmos et al 2002). As Child and McGrath point out, reconsidering the\ncentrality of bureaucracy, and hence hierarchy, to organisational form is a\nfundamental question:\n\u2018How can we improve upon, even replace such a painstakingly well developed\nconcept of how human beings collectively best accomplish their objectives?\u2019\n(2002:1136).\nSince organisational design solutions have already received so much attention, as\nyet with limited outcomes for greater democratisation (Manville and Ober 2003), it is\nour intention, in this paper, to look elsewhere in addressing the problem of\ncongruence in organisational forms. One alternative starting point is the\ntransformation of attitudes to hierarchical control through management education.\nYet the potential for management education and learning1 to impact on this debate at\neither an organisational or societal level, has been largely unfulfilled. For Burgoyne\nand Jackson, leading commentators in the field of management learning (ML), its\n5effectiveness has been curtailed by a preoccupation with unitary values (1997:54).\nThis has the effect of oversimplifying ML processes by excluding the cognitive,\nsymbolic and political elements of management development activity. In turn, that\nhas led to a situation where many management development initiatives have failed to\nmake an impact on organisation effectiveness because they focus on an idealized\nnotion of what should be happening, rather than factoring in inherent organisational\nand interpersonal complexities (ibid).\nAt a societal level, the way in which ML has been moulded has also come under\ncriticism. Despite the aspirations of liberal adult educationalists to foster values of\nchallenge, critique and reform, commentators have pointed to the increasing\nmanagerialism (Holman 2000:205), vocationalism (Tight 1998:117) and instrumental\nrationality (Torres 1996:200) evident in much Western government policy on adult\neducation. These influences have served to limit the scope of management learning\nby emphasizing a vision of management that denies its social, political and moral\naspects. In doing so it reinforces the values of standardisation and formalisation\n(Holman 2000:207) that lie at the heart of the bureaucratic model of organisation.\nIn contrast, we will maintain in this paper that such lack of progress may be\nsurmounted, and that ML does indeed have significant potential to reframe the nature\nof hierarchy in contemporary organisational forms and in doing so enable individuals\nto exercise greater control over their own work lives (Alvesson and Willmott 1996).\nOur goals are thus emancipatory in design, which as Connell and Nord (1996)\nobserve, is consistent with an increasing acceptance within organisation science of\ncontributions informed by such interests. These writers also note that scholars in this\n6field are increasingly willing to discuss their values, and we acknowledge our own in\nthis spirit.\nWe argue that the particular aspirational values of liberal adult educationalists, above\nall, enlightenment, personal autonomy and emancipation, provide a basis for\nestablishing the kind of organisational mechanisms that can enable senior executives\nto synthesise the tension between diversity of interests and organisational\ncoherence. However, these values are in themselves but one subset of the very\nbroad educational church (Tight 1996), and at present remain primarily of interest to\nadult educators and some management learning practitioners alone. The purpose of\nthis paper, therefore, is to provide further voice for these ideas. We intend to\narticulate a broad agenda that positions the aspirational values of liberal adult\neducation (AE) as having a significant contribution to make to contemporary\norganisational forms in terms of democratisation and effectiveness. The paper is\nintended to stimulate debate (Driver 2002) about the values of AE by examining\nthese as the basis for organisational voluntarism. We define organisational\nvoluntarism as a stage of organisational evolution\/a marker of organisational form in\nwhich managers recognise the need to engage in debate and action in order to\npursue matters of individual and organisation concern irrespective of formal position\nor explicit authority. The original concept is drawn from the field of political\nphilosophy, and explored here as a nascent alternative unifying mechanism to\nhierarchy. Our intention is to illuminate how the greater adoption of voluntarism as an\norganizing principle may be facilitated by the application of AE values.\nIn sympathy with several other authors (see for example, Fox and Grey 2000, Tight\n2000), we see considerable gain to be had by greater cross disciplinary discussion in\n7the area of AE, and as such, we have deliberately tried to provide a broad ranging\nargument to encourage debate from different constituencies. We begin by briefly\nsummarising the dominant values evident in the liberal subset of AE, positioning\nthem alongside the field of ML and the business requisites that are considered to\nshape contemporary organisations. Following this, motivations of senior managers to\napply these ideas in practice are examined, addressing in particular the self-fulfilling\nlimitations that a hierarchical mindset imposes. The concept of voluntarism is then\nexplored as an alternative binding mechanism to hierarchy in the context of pluralist\norganisation and the underpinning association with AE values discussed. The paper\nwill conclude with an examination of the implications for senior executives and\nmanagement educationalists themselves.\nAdult Education and Management Learning\nAE encompasses many different disciplines, including political science, economics,\npsychology, history, and sociology, each of which serves to create a rich, yet diverse\nset of epistemological starting points. A full analysis of the values that inform such a\nvaried field is consequently not possible here, and we summarise only key themes\npertinent to the ML agenda. We follow a reformist approach (Thomas 1982) to AE\nderived from a conflict model of society, where, building on the work of Paulo Freire\n(1972) and others, the focus for AE is to emancipate individuals by causing them to\nquestion the power relationships embedded in socio-economic structures, value\nsystems and cultural norms by which knowledge comes to be taken as granted. From\nthis perspective power is viewed, not simply as a commodity possessed by one\ngroup over another, but as a relational characteristic implicit in all social practices.\nWe pursue a reformist position because this perspective has been particularly\n8influential in the management learning debate (Burgoyne and Reynolds 1997) and\nbecause the reformist school of thinking most closely allies with the agenda for\nrevising the role of hierarchy as the primary mechanism of integration, and our aim in\nthis paper is to provide greater voice for this agenda.\nFrom this liberal reformist perspective, AE, in the western world is a tradition that\ndepends on faith in informed free choice, self awareness, emancipation through self\nunderstanding, and a capacity for self reflection through rational discourse (Mezirow\n2000). Over time much ML activity has come to embody many of these tenets of\nreformist AE philosophy. For example, key to this tradition in both AE and ML is the\nbelief that learning is constrained by the historical power networks in which it is\nembedded (Chia 1997, Reynolds 1999, Brookfield 2001). These need to be surfaced\nif rational discourse is to take place free from domination. Thus in both AE (Mezirow\n2000) and ML (Burgoyne and Jackson 1997), commentators are keen to create\nprotected learning environments in which the conditions for fostering greater personal\nautonomy and self-authorship are possible. For example, Burgoyne and Jackson\n(1997) put forward a thesis of ML as a pluralist arena where spaces need to be\ncreated and protected to encourage debate about organisation purpose and values.\nThe enhanced personal autonomy that this dialogue can provide is considered\ncentral to democratic processes at both an organisational (Coopey and Burgoyne\n2000, Cunningham and Dawes 1997) and societal level (Warren 1992). For if\nindividuals are more empowered, their experiences will enable them to be more\nsocially responsible, voluntaristic more tolerant, more knowledgeable, and more\nattentive to their own and others\u2019 interests (Warren 1992, Mezirow 2000).\n9Yet, both also suffer from limited practical impact. AE values are generally accepted\nin practice, as aspirational and the product of democratic habits of the heart (Bellah\n1992). In an ML context Reynolds (2000) and Burgoyne and Reynolds (1997)\ndescribe them as utopian but see them as influencing such ML concepts as self-\ndevelopment, self managed learning and teamwork. They point out (ibid), however,\nthat if management is intrinsically associated with the exercise of power, values such\nas openness and trust may only serve to render people accessible to even greater\ndegrees of control. In contrast, Mezirow, sees these same values as \u2018a credible\nresponse to the post modernist threat that society\u2019s power inevitably corrupts critical\ndiscourse and rationality\u2019 (1997:13). Nevertheless, it is clear that their application in\npractice remains relatively limited, especially in an organisational setting.\nIf, therefore, these values have hitherto largely represented an unfulfilled agenda of\nboth adult and ML educationalists, why should they still be considered of relevance to\ntoday\u2019s organisational members? Our interest in particular lies with senior managers\nas a social group, because it is this group, who, like it or not, are best placed to\ninstitute such organisational reform from their hierarchical vantage point.\nChanges in organisational form\nThere has been much consideration of how the broader shifts in the nature of social\ninstitutions are impacting organisational forms (Sparrow and Cooper 1998, Cohen\n2003). Gratton and Ghoshal (2003) describe this \u2018revolution\u2019 in terms of a desire for\nindividuals to express their potential, the need for protection from the arbitrary use of\npower, and involvement in people determining the conditions of their association\n(2003:1). These types of change are consequently seen to be transforming individual\n10\nrelationships with institutions and, in consequence, at both social and organisational\nlevels, there are increased pressures for greater democratisation (Patten 2000,\nVigoda and Golembiewsky 2001, Vigoda 2002). In this context we define\norganisational democratisation in terms of the need for enhanced individual\nautonomy and the legitimisation of processes that enable such individuals to be self\nreflective - to deliberate, judge, choose and act upon courses of action (Held 1987)\nas free as possible from unequal power relationships.\nAt the same time as demands for these democratised organisation forms increase,\nthe competitive business environment forces organisations to be more efficient and\nresponsive, in turn creating loosely coupled and structurally diverse organisations\n(see for example, Malnight 2001, Schilling and Steensma 2001, Ravasi and Verona\n2000) with varied and competing interests (Butcher and Clarke 2002). In such\npluralistic settings \u2018leadership roles are shared, objectives divergent and power\ndiffuse\u2019 (Denis et al 2001:809) and sustainable competitive advantage is seen to lie in\n\u2018micro assets that are hard to discern and awkward to trade\u2019 (Johnson et al 2003:4).\nThese assets are most likely to lie at the edges of organisations in the hands of line\nmanagers, such that more people, more often, need to be involved in strategy than\never before (ibid).\nFaced with these institutional shifts and competitive pressures, business leaders are\ntherefore being forced to reappraise basic assumptions about the nature of jobs and\nthe design of organisations (Cloke and Goldsmith, 2002, Gratton 2003, Sparrow and\nCooper 1998). In particular, they are required to consider the costs and benefits of\nhigh trust systems in securing the commitment of such autonomous knowledge\nassets. To what extent can employers trust employee capabilities to exercise\n11\nresponsible self direction and self control and to what extent should this self direction\nbe guided by a dominant philosophy of shared values (Sparrow and Cooper 1998)?\nWhilst there are divergent views as to the impact of these challenges on\norganisational form, there appear to be certain common themes emerging: firstly,\ndevolved power and responsibility for many more organisational decisions, leading to\nsmaller, self-organising units (see, for example, Miles et al 1997, Child and McGrath\n2002, Ashmos et al 2002); secondly, acceptance of diverse internal and external\ninterests based on power derived from successful relationships rather than\nhierarchical position (see, for example, Denis et al 2001, Buchanan and Badham\n1999, Butcher and Clarke 2002). Lastly, high levels of psychological ownership of\norganisational activities that depend on individual contribution, knowledge and\nleadership (Handy 1997, Miles et al 1997, Kim 2002).\nThompson and Davidson (1996) suggest that these themes are merely the product of\nan anti bureaucratic rhetoric and bear little resemblance to the reality of\norganisational life. We have some sympathy with this view, for these alleged changes\nreflect a strongly pluralist\/democratic model of organisation to which values of AE\nhave a natural affinity, and in principle should have a profound effect on hierarchy as\nthe central means of maintaining organisational congruence. However, despite the\npressure on executives to reconsider the conventions of organisational structure,\nthese emerging operating principles have been argued to create deep organisational\ntension because they appear so at odds with the bureaucratic mindset (Adler 1999,\nChild and McGrath 2002). Ghoshal describes this problem as the implementation of\nthird generation strategies, through second generation organisations by first\ngeneration managers \u2013 \u2018whose personal sense of their roles and value added, and\n12\nwhose personal skills and competencies have all been shaped by an earlier out\ndated model\u2019 (1997:626)\nWe contend that this \u2018outdated model\u2019 exemplifies how the wider institutions of\norganisational and social life act as deep influences of action (Giddens 1984). Since\nhierarchy, is arguably implicit in all forms of organising (Leavitt 2003), it has come to\nbe seen as a process for facilitating dominant bureaucratic values, whereby power\nfocussed at the corporate centre and top down decision making become the \u2018natural\u2019\nmechanism of unitary working (Butcher and Atkinson 2001, Cludts 1999, Adler 1999).\nSuch is the influence of this way of viewing organisations that attempts to empower\nemployees and to create less authoritarian organisation cultures only tend to\nreinforce unitary approaches to managing (Cludts 1999, Willmott 1993, Weick 1998).\nThis has the effect of creating a gap between the rhetoric of employee participation\nand the reality of organisational control (Legge 1995, Thompson and Davidson\n1996). In turn, this encourages cynicism (Dean et al 1998) and a calculative\napproach to participation (Cludts 1999). The pre-eminence of this schema also has\nthe effect of diminishing the legitimacy of alternative models of organising, and thus\nthe opportunity for radically reframing the role of participation and its juxtaposition\nwith hierarchy remains under-explored by senior managers (Cludts 1999). It is\nprecisely to redress this bias that AE\/ML values can have an impact, and we offer\nthree reasons why, in theory at least, they are worthy of serious consideration by\nmanagers.\nChallenge and Critique\n13\nA key product of AE is the value of critique, especially of power relationships and\ntheir impact on how individuals frame and resolve issues (Brookfield 2001). In an\norganisational setting, encouraging emancipation through heightened awareness of\nthe impact of institutionalised power provides the possibility for revealing how a\nunitary frame of reference constrains thinking (Alvesson and Willmott 1996). In\ntheory, for those managers already alive to the prospect of greater individual\nautonomy, this insight might serve to champion organisational pluralism and to\nchallenge the dominance of the hierarchy as a means of ensuring congruence. An\nability to appraise the role of hierarchy would be especially important for those\nexecutives with responsibility for organisation design, as it would for managers\nfrustrated by institutionalised routines that reflect the centrality of power in\norganisations (Hales 1999, Alvesson and Willmott 1996).\nWorking with Plurality of Motives\nAs organisations fragment into smaller, devolved operating units, effective\norganisational governance becomes more dependent on satisfying the resultant\ndiversity of interests and claims to (partial) independence. Reconciling these is key to\ncollective organisational endeavour being sustained (Cludts 1999), yet attempting to\ndo so primarily through top down decision-making is not feasible (Ashkenas 1999).\nConsequently, in recent years management has sought ways to take greater account\nof local needs and opinions so as to retain corporate-wide commitment to strategic\ngoals. However, there is now substantial evidence that the alternatives of controlled\ndecentralisation or culture management are far from effective, and in the case of the\nlatter, of questionable ethical rigour (see, for example, Willmott 1993, Hope and\nHendry 1995, Ackers and Preston 1997, Whinstanley et al 1996).\n14\nNotwithstanding these problems, the requirement to address diverse interests\ninevitably accelerates organisational democratisation. Yet for democratisation to\nstand as a complimentary unifying mechanism to hierarchy, sectional interests need\nto have a \u2018voice\u2019, the autonomy and the independence of mind to participate in\ndebate about contested views (Cludts 1999). The presence of AE values of challenge\nand critique, open discourse, and a willingness to seek voluntary agreement, would\nstrengthen the political processes required for reconciling competing interests\ninherent in devolved organisation forms.\nProtected Environments\nImplicit in the notion of reformative AE is its subversive and irreverent nature, such\nthat \u2018when AE has a purpose to change society in either radical or reformative\nrespects, authority is likely to curb it\u2019 (Thomas 1982:57). Consequently, as Mezirow\npoints out, adult educators often create \u2018protected environments\u2019 in which to foster\nlearning insights, as free as possible from the influence of unequal power\nrelationships (2000:31). Whilst Mezirow\u2019s point is predominantly made to highlight the\nimportance of collaborative learning relationships in AE, the idea is picked up by\nother authors. For example, Yorks and Marsick (2000) recognise that the questioning\nand voluntary nature of AE may well be considered threatening by senior\nmanagement. They argue that organisations need to create space for learning to\ntake place, but point out that because of the unpredictable outcomes from such\nactivities, senior management may be apprehensive about doing so. The possibility\nof creating protected environments to foster emancipation from hierarchical thinking\ntherefore provides a further application of AE values for organisations. Importantly, it\n15\nembodies the reflexivity inherent in liberal AE practice in that it explicitly\nacknowledges AE\u2019s subversive tendencies.\nThe AE Agenda in ML Practice\nThese reasons for giving managerial consideration to AE reformist values and\npractices do not, in themselves, provide the mechanism for resolving the problem of\ncongruence, precisely because they fundamentally recast the relevance of\norganisational unity and are thus likely to be viewed with suspicion. In practice, the\nproducts and consequences of AE will hold varying degrees of legitimacy in\nmanagerial eyes. How, then, could ML professionals persuade managers to see\nthese as useful in evolving organisational forms more commensurate with the\nrequirements of the contemporary business environment? We argue there are three\npossible points of departure for increasing the adoption of AE values.\nTop Down\nIn as much as it is argued there is increasing acceptance of organisational pluralism\n(Cloke and Goldsmith 2002), top managers may be receptive to an AE agenda. Their\nefforts to balance local autonomy with corporate imperatives appears to imply as\nmuch, as does their recognition that continuous innovation does not come from\ncorporate policies and processes (Sutton 2001), so much as from those who are able\nto operate outside existing frames of reference. ML activity designed to enhance top\nmanagement appreciation of the utility of AE values is thus one possible starting\npoint. Its great attraction lies in the organisational redesign that would flow as a\n16\nconsequence, that is to say, in hierarchical power being harnessed to transform the\nrole of hierarchy.\nHowever, there are two evident limitations to this approach. Firstly, the search for an\norganisational unifying mechanism more fitting to the contemporary business\nenvironment cannot be taken as strong evidence that top management is willing to\nrenounce hierarchical principles. This can be seen in the application of ideas about\nthe Learning Organisation (Senge 1990, Pedlar et al 1991) in which lifelong learning,\nself critique, emancipation and collaborative learning are all considered key\n(Easterby Smith 1997). Applied top down as an OD solution to organisation renewal\nhowever, this approach has been criticised as an altruistic and unrealisable fad (Tight\n1996), as well as functionalist and normative (Easterby-Smith 1997). In effect, values\nof economic efficiency tend to rationalise attempts to adopt more pluralistic\napproaches. Secondly, the motivation of ML practitioners to engage top management\nin the AE values debate is open to question. These professionals may themselves\nstruggle to accept the pluralism that they operate within; moreover, they may lack\nsufficient hierarchical position to capture top management attention (Butcher et al\n2002). In other words, the self-fulfilling quality of a unification based on the\nmechanism of hierarchy may assert itself despite its increasingly improbable efficacy.\nWhilst there may be some purchase through a top down approach, it cannot\ntherefore be the central platform of ML activity.\nBottom Up\nIntroducing AE values from the bottom up is, on face value, a more promising\nproposition. However, a bottom up approach mandated by top management is\n17\ninevitably susceptible to the same censorship tendency noted above. We therefore\nconfine our analysis hereto the notion of bottom up processes existing beyond the\nreach of top management. Typically these will arise when groups at lower\nhierarchical levels seek of their own volition to develop voice, independence and\nautonomy in their activities.\nIn recent years there has been a greater exploration of bottom up processes of\nchange that reflect efforts to circumvent the concentration of hierarchical power.\nMuch of this stems from communities of practice theory (Brown and Duguid, 1991,\n2001, Lave and Wenger 1991) and in particular the work of critical theorists in this\narea (notably Reynolds 1998, Willmott 1997, Fox 2000). In these communities,\nlearning, innovation and its dissemination take place in both canonical (formal)\ngroups and non-canonical (informal) groups (Brown and Duguid 1991). From a\ncritical perspective, power and knowledge are indivisible from each other and\ninstitutional power distributions are a substantial mediating variable in the way\nlearning and change are constrained or exploited (Fox 2000). Because such\ncommunities work on voluntary innovations that threaten existing power distributions,\nthey can be perceived as unconventional, and to avoid hierarchical repression, may\nneed to take care to protect themselves (Clarke and Meldrum 1999). This can be\nachieved through lobbying and securing sponsors at senior organisational levels, and\ncareful boundary management of information (Swan et al 2002).\nUnofficial organisational entities of this kind appear naturally to embrace many AE\nvalues (Reedy 2003). Community members determine their own agenda, and the\nvoluntary nature of their action implies a level of autonomy and independence of\nthinking. In generating support they have to take account of alternative points of view,\n18\nand seek some level of agreement for their actions if they are to establish\norganisational legitimacy. Most importantly, because these groups are not formally\nsanctioned initially and act against the status quo, they implicitly include a critical\nassessment of existing power relationships, and in consequence, individuals acquire\nan ability to influence organisational working (Clarke and Meldrum 1999). A\ncommunity of practice may therefore represent \u2018space\u2019 in which conflicting\norganisational purposes can be debated, and a process through which a degree of\npersonal emancipation can be achieved (Burgoyne and Jackson 1997).\nHowever, whilst the value of voluntaristic community in learning is now well\nestablished as a major precept in both AE and ML canons (Courtney 1992, Reedy\n2003, Taylor 2000), there is little evidence to suggest that ML practitioners have\nembraced this in practice (Burgoyne and Jackson 1997). ML strategy has yet to\nevolve towards the active search for unsanctioned organisational activity which, once\nfound, is then supported and protected on its own terms. Rather, it would appear that\nML practitioners have sought to graft pluralist AE methodologies onto hierarchical\nvalue systems that has resulted in the alignment and structuring of communities as a\ntop down managed process (Swan et al 2002, Fox 2000, Reynolds 2000).\nVoluntarism as a means of achieving congruence\nWe therefore argue that neither top down nor bottom up processes provide the senior\nexecutive with a vehicle or rationale for adopting AE values in re-conceptualising the\nproblem of congruence. Neither starting point engenders the consideration of AE\nvalues as integral to meeting the challenges of managing multiple stakeholders whilst\n19\nmaintaining essential levels of organisational coherence. For to do so amounts to re\nexamining our understanding of organisation purpose.\nAccording to agency theory, hierarchy is intended to produce a level of control to\nensure economic efficiency in the pursuit of shareholder returns. Because\nshareholders have a super-ordinate proprietary claim, organisational purpose is\nassociated with one constituent above all others. However, aside from objections on\nthe grounds of political bias, this solution to the problem of ownership is evidently\nunsustainable in a society where multiple stakeholders are able to assert themselves\n(Etzioni 1998). If hierarchy now needs to function in a way that reflects the claims of\nmany different constituents, it is because organisational purpose cannot be cast in\nunitary terms. Instead, purpose is determined either as an outcome of undesired\nconflict or through the mediation of desired conflict, that is to say, democracy.\nReframing the problem of congruence in contemporary organisational forms is thus\none of reconciling hierarchy with democracy, of going beyond the notion that more of\none necessitates less of the other.\nIn attempting to address this central organisational issue we have found in the arena\nof political philosophy a parallel debate that we consider to be instructive, a\nprecedence for which was set by Graham (1991) in conceptualising organisational\ncitizenship with reference to modern political theory. In the political discourse\nsurrounding the basis for a good democratic society, the same polarised tension\nbetween top down control and autonomy can be identified. Should society rely on the\nstate to shape good citizens, as social conservatives would have it, or should good\ncitizens be the product of a liberal moral pluralism? Thinkers such as Etzioni (1999,\n1995), Putnam (2000), and Verba et al (1995) promote a third, communitarian\n20\napproach to tackling this issue that has many parallels for the debate about achieving\norganisational coherence. From a communitarian perspective, in the good society the\nmoral voice that determines the nature of good citizenship is the product of a\ndiversity of voluntary associations, from membership of societies and clubs at one\nend of the continuum, to membership of political parties and religious movements at\nthe other. These groups serve to mediate between the private world of individuals\nand the large institutions of society. The opportunity selectively to participate in\nassociations, free from state influence, is fundamental to the creation and\npreservation of liberty. However, most importantly, a good society is determined by\nsuch voluntary associations implicitly inculcating a level of self control in its members\nby introducing them to particular values that reinforce individuals\u2019 normative\ncommitments to that society. In other words, it is the ability to cultivate a limited set of\ncore values within a framework free from coercion that is the hallmark of a mature\ndemocratic society.\nWe wish to introduce the argument that the concept of voluntarism, and its\nconstituent themes of diversity and self-control provide a plausible alternative\nintegrating mechanism in organisational settings where accommodating plurality of\ninterest is critical, notably for example with knowledge intensive industries (Cunha\n2002). In parallel with the concept of the good society, the \u2018good organisation\u2019 would\ngive priority to establishing voluntarism as a principle of organisational design. As\ndemocratic systems of governance ensure and protect the right to voluntary\nassociation, so hierarchy may serve to legitimise this same principle.\nAt this point in time, when set against the dominance of the rational mindset and the\nillegitimacy of alternative approaches, voluntaristic behaviour in organisations can be\n21\nbest understood as an expression of individual agency. Over time, its wider adoption\nas a managerial approach will depend upon its efficacy in meeting calls for both\ngreater democratisation and commercial effectiveness. It is important to note\nhowever, that we see hierarchy and plurality as always being in tension; they are at\none level dialectically opposed, and at another, both essential aspects of organizing\n(Brunson 2002). As in mature societies, once levels of democracy have been\nattained, the focus for political discourse is one of expressing preferences about its\nenactment. We do not suggest, therefore, that voluntarism will resolve this tension in\nplurality and coherence, but instead that it provides a \u2018relational synthesis\u2019 (Clegg\n2003:378) of both.\nThis perspective is congruent with the emerging discourses on co evolution and\ncomplexity, (Lewin and Volberda 1999, Brown and Eisenhardt 1997, Boisot and Child\n1999) which take as their point of departure the idea that organisation change and\nevolution are a reflection of multi level and multi directional causalities in inter and\nintra firm interdependencies. This perspective thus gives close attention to the\nplurality of interests at play in organisations. Weick (1998), Kamoche and Cunha\n(2001) and others have employed a jazz metaphor to understand the resulting\nevolutionary process in which organizing is viewed as the embellishment of small\nstructures, individual action and the negotiation of \u2018a shared sense of beat\u2019 (Weick\n1998:550). In knowledge intensive industries in particular, a few simple organising\nrules or semi structures (Brown and Eisenhardt 1997, Okhuysen and Eisenhardt\n2002) are argued to enable individual action in the interests of organisation\neffectiveness.\n22\nIn this context, organisation voluntarism may constitute one such simple rule and we\nthus define voluntarism as a stage of organisational evolution\/a marker of\norganisational form in which managers recognise the need to engage in debate and\naction in order to pursue matters of individual and organisation concern irrespective\nof formal position or explicit authority. The principle of voluntarism predicts that\nunofficially constituted groups in organisational settings are able to provide the level\nof self-control necessary for the maintenance of congruence (Ashmos et al 2002); a\nmultiplicity of stakeholder agendas does not necessarily create organisational\nincoherence (Rowley and Moldoveanu 2003, Thietart and Forgues 1997). Further,\nthat such groups are more likely to do so when they can express voice and contest\nviews about which organisational values are important to them (Cludts 1999). As with\nvoluntary associations, organisational arrangements of this type would bring people\ntogether to pursue interests through collective action, serve to distribute power, and\nmediate between individuals and the organisation, thereby creating a sense of\ninvolvement. Crucially, they would voluntarily facilitate the flow of information\nbetween different groups and the organisational connectivity required to stimulate\ninnovation (Ashmos et al 2002).\nThe role for hierarchy would then become one of seeking to encourage voluntary\ngroups to develop their own identity. This may take the form of praise, reward or\nsupport, whilst avoiding coercion towards centrally determined priorities, in order that\ngroups themselves influence the establishment of organisational core values.\nExtending the parallel with democratic governance, the role of hierarchy would also\nbe to mediate between deserving causes, challenging constituents to justify the\nsignificance of their agendas and their demands for resource. The role of top\nmanagement would remain to provide fundamental organisational framing, but by\n23\ntaking into consideration many voices, and by satisfactorily justifying their\nconclusions and actions to their constituents.\nOrganisational leadership thus comes to reflect a collective phenomenon (Barker\n1997) in which the representation of different organisational constituencies, by a wide\nrange of individuals assumes a greater significance. This representative role is\nessential to ensure that participation does not become enforced and thus merely\nprovide a more sophisticated from of control (Robertson and Swan 2003). In practice\nthis means that politics, as with its counterpart in a political institutional setting, is a\nnecessary and logical process by which diverse interests and stakeholders are\nreconciled (Butcher and Clarke 2002, Held 1987). Indeed, as with the political\ninstitutional model, significant interest groups serve to check the power invested in\nformal hierarchy. Therefore, far from politics being an irrational organisational\nresponse (Stone 1997), such activity becomes a judicious way of managing\ninevitable differences. The legitimate pursuit of agendas also provides greater\nopportunities for individuals to negotiate self and work identities and thus provides\nchoices regarding identification with wider organisational priorities. In this way\ncommunities become arenas for the \u2018politics of difference\u2019 (Reynolds 2000:71). This\ndiffers from traditional communitarian and much co evolutionary thinking, which often\nfail to take account of asymmetries of power and social difference (ibid 2000).\nArguably, nascent elements of the \u2018good\u2019 organisation, which highlight the individual\nand organisational benefits of voluntarism, have long been discernible.\nA recent coevolutionary study by Galunic and Eisenhardt (2001) reveals how senior\nmanagers have crafted an organisational form where diversity and autonomy of\naction is greatly encouraged, but an appropriate degree of alignment is still achieved.\n24\nThis culture and architecture are the result of a decentralised and self organised\nbehaviour. Divisions are free to shape their own portfolios, including the warrant to\ncontest other divisions for control of different products and markets. In response,\nsenior managers reward winners and good corporate citizenship but also help losers\nto improve. Most importantly, such decisions are guided by social considerations\nabout fairness as well as economic imperatives for profit and growth. However, in this\nstudy, as with much of the coevolutionary discourse, the role of power, remains\nunder explored.\nIn contrast, Denis et al (2001), in their study of leadership and strategic change in the\npluralistic setting of hospital administration, note how the use of power through\nconstructive political activity, in terms of compromise, lobbying, alliances and\ncollaborative solutions are central to the leadership process. In a situation where\npower is diffuse and objectives divergent, levels of coherence are achieved by\nconstellations of leaders who are sensitive to the needs of different constituencies in\norder to gain credibility and support. In particular, Denis et al note the role of \u2018creative\nindividuals and committed unified groups in proactively moving to make change\nhappen\u2019 (2001:834) in situations where the legitimacy of change initiatives cannot be\ntaken for granted. The same conclusions are reached by Clarke and Meldrum (1999)\nin their study of bottom up change and Lipman Blumen and Leavitt\u2019s (1999)\nexploration of \u2018hot groups\u2019 reflects similar aspects of unofficial behaviour.\nEvidence of the way in which such communities can stimulate change and innovation\nis also provided by Swan et al (2002) who demonstrate how radical innovation in the\nhealth care sector was achieved against a backdrop of diverse professional interests\nand uneven power relations. Coherence in approach was achieved through a\n25\ndiscursive strategy, reflective of Reynolds \u2018politics of difference\u2019 (2000:71), that\nsought to align the competing interests and agendas in the innovation process\nthrough the rhetoric of community and engagement with the diverse interests that\nconstituted that community. Also, similar to the Galunic and Eisenhardt case, the\nmanagement team were able to balance commercial interests with the broader\nvalues of other groups by sublimating purely economic considerations in the cause of\ncommunity building. Research by Ashmos et al (2002) suggests that this type of\nengagement helps to generate multiple perspectives of the environment, In turn, this\nalters an organisation\u2019s predisposition to new challenges and opportunities, thus\nstimulating innovation and continual adaptation. Similar conclusions are reached by\nRavasi and Verona (2001) in their analysis of the Danish company Oticon. In Oticon\ninnovation is sustained by structural ambiguity and voluntary project initiatives, and\nstrategic coherence the product of continual negotiation amongst a plurality of\ncoordinating groups and roles.\nWhilst these studies sometimes reflect different epistemological starting points,\ncommon to each are high levels of structural ambiguity and thus the opportunity for\ngroups to initiate activity and influence outcomes irrespective of formal authority. In\nthe work of Denis et al (ibid)), this was largely the result of individual agency, whilst in\nthe studies of Ravasi and Verona (ibid) and Galunic and Eisenhardt (ibid) this activity\nhad become an accepted cultural norm. In the study by Swan et al, the creation of a\ncommunity was used as a device deliberately to overcome unequal power\ndistributions.\nTowards an agenda for ML professionals\n26\nIn positioning voluntarism as a nascent approach to resolving the tensions of\norganisational plurality and coherence, we therefore argue that the principles of AE\nrepresent a vehicle for encouraging this transformation by surfacing the vested\ninterests of the bureaucratic model. Voluntarism is predicated on an\nacknowledgement of the value of plurality, and without the capabilities of challenge\nand critique, voluntary groups will be unable to engage in debate with that diversity of\ninterests in a way that takes account of institutionalised power relationships evident\nin the rational mindset. Nor will voluntary groups be able to participate in non-\nconventional activity unless they are able to protect themselves from traditional\nhierarchical control.\nWe believe that the application of these principles can be promoted on the basis that\nvoluntarism responds to calls for both responsive and agile organisations and more\ndemocratic organisation forms. In knowledge intensive industries, where plurality of\ninterests are often at their most pronounced, the concept of voluntarism provides a\nframework for capitalising on diversity in the pursuit of innovation. Local communities,\nbeing at the interface of the organisation and its environment are seen to be a rich\nsource of innovation (Brown and Duguid 1991, 2001). Research by Ashmos et al\n(2002) and Ravasi and Verona (2001) highlights how participation helps to generate\nmultiple perspectives that in turn alters an organisation\u2019s predisposition to new\nchallenges and opportunities, thus potentially stimulating innovation.\nOur own early research in this area (Clarke 2004) suggests that working with a\nvoluntaristic mindset also enables opportunities for enhancing individual autonomy.\nVoluntarism requires managers to work with a wide variety of constituencies\npromoting a plurality of discourses about the nature of organising, and thus extends\n27\nthe opportunities for identity formation in ways that challenge institutionalised\ndefinitions (Alvesson and Willmott 2002 Robertson and Swan 2003, Knights and\nMcCabe 2003). In doing so, managers are able to establish levels of micro\nemancipation (Alvesson and Willmott 1996, 2002) very much in keeping with\ntraditional AE values.\nDespite these supportive findings, we are nevertheless left with the central question\nof why senior management would be willing to embrace this transition. The evidence\nwe have is hardly sufficient for ML professionals to challenge deeply embedded\nbeliefs about rational organisation, whether this is on the ground of organisational\neffectiveness or ethical governance. More encouragingly, it may be argued that as\npluralism becomes undeniable, so too does the pressure on executives to find\nworkable alternative organisational arrangements, for example, that enhance\nattracting and retaining talented employees. However, there is little to suggest that\nmanifest transformation of the social context of organisations represents the\nimpelling educational force necessary to produce a corresponding cognitive and\naffective shift in managers, the faltering of the empowerment imperative over the past\nquarter century being a case in point (Argyris1998).\nIf ML professionals have been largely impotent in introducing AE values from the\nstarting point of either the top down or bottom up, it seems improbable that they will\nbe able to make a cogent argument for introducing the principle of voluntarism and\nAE values as an alternative means of accomplishing coherence. The same\npreoccupation with unitary thinking, whether organisationally or self-imposed is likely\nto prevail. As Reynolds (2000) notes, whilst there are some glimpses of ML\/AE\nprinciples being applied in practice, it is hard to identify management education\n28\npractice that clearly reflects the \u2018politics of difference\u2019. Yet in as much as ML\nprofessionals identify with AE values, they probably represent the greatest single\nrepository of understanding of the significance of those values for organisations. If\nthis insight cannot be brought to bear directly, then the ML professional\u2019s task can\nonly be one of brokering the required independent intellectual critique and\neducational process necessary to elucidate the significance of the AE agenda, and of\ncreating the organisational exposure for this to be possible. The natural candidate for\nthis intervention is the academic community, most particularly business schools,\nsince their intellectual sovereignty should provide not only critique, but also the\nprotected environment necessary to consider AE values.\nHowever, the proposition that business schools deliver intellectual independence is a\nmatter of considerable controversy. At the centre of this debate has been the concern\nthat business schools have become unduly responsive to institutional pressures for\ngreater vocationalism and for the professionalisation of management that takes\ninsufficient account of the social, political and ethical aspects of managing (Reed and\nAnthony 1992, Willmott 1994, Holman 2000, Reynolds 2000). One effect of this is\nthat managers may only \u2018surface learn\u2019 and be unable to engage with the deep level\nprocessing required to grasp the significance of AE values in practice (Watson\n1996:461). As Burrell (1989) puts it, they learn with their beliefs rather than about\ntheir beliefs. Furthermore, because the intellectual heritage of many business school\nfaculty leads them to emphasise the cerebral rather than the emotional domain of\nlearning, the developmental agenda implicit in AE values is rarely part of the\ncurriculum (Willmott 1994). Case studies and analytical models are the established\ncurrency, not in-depth personal development (Mintzberg 1992). This raises the\n29\nquestion as to the likely motivation of business schools to respond to a call from ML\nspecialists to pursue a reformist AE agenda.\nThe most compelling reason is the very need for relevance sought by management in\ntheir struggle to reconcile unitary organisational principles with the reality of pluralistic\npurpose. Furthermore, because business education has become big business, the\nbusiness schools are now subject to unprecedented global media attention which has\nthe power to transform them destructively from substance to image, but also\nconstructively towards creating substance of greater worth (Gioia and Corley, 2002).\nAmongst other effects, this growing transparency has revealed that there is little\nevidence of business school research influencing management practice, calling into\nquestion the professional relevance of management scholarship (Pfeffer and Fong,\n2002). In other words, the conditions are increasingly conducive to demand\nrelevance from the business schools, and ML professionals are organisationally well\nplaced to do so. If in responding, the business schools can establish the true\nintellectual independence they claim to possess, then they will offer the protected\nenvironment necessary for management to consider the significance of AE values for\ntheir organisations.\nConclusion\nOur purpose in this paper has been to contribute to the debate about the role of AE\nand ML principles in the democratisation of organisations, with the problem of\ncongruence in mind. We have taken as our starting point the idea that without\nprinciples and practices for encouraging and channelling commitment genuinely\nunfettered by tacit or implicit coercion, organisations are unlikely now to be able to\n30\noperate effectively (Manville and Ober 2003). Whilst pronouncements on \u2018the end of\nmanagement\u2019 (Cloke and Goldsmith, 2002) may be premature, reconfiguring the role\nof hierarchy is clearly a central consideration. Here we have sought to introduce the\nidea that this is dependent upon management appreciating the value of voluntarism\nin both valuing stakeholder diversity and maintaining levels of strategic coherence.\nHowever, evidently this is no easy task. If democracy is rooted in free discourse, the\nrequisite level of voluntarism can only be achieved if managers themselves are\nconfident to challenge and critique existing power relationships, and able to resolve\nthe apparent contradiction presented by a plurality of motives. When informed by\nreformist adult education values, management learning provides perhaps the only\narena to debate these issues, and create the profound effect of raising\nconsciousness of self identity and autonomy (Habermas 1975, cited in Warren 1992).\nIn applying these principles, both executives and management learning professionals\nwould be extending the possibilities for greater organisational democracy. In so\ndoing, voluntarism, challenge and critique could be legitimised as central tenets of\nboth organisational design and executive development. If organisational democracy\nis at least in part dependent on critical and accountable processes of education, then\nthe application of the adult education values we have described here may be one\nfurther step toward achieving that.\nNote\nThe authors would like to thank the two anonymous referees and Gordon Dehler for their thoughtful\nand helpful suggestions for improving this article.\n1. Clarifying the definitions of management education, management development, organisational\nlearning and related terms has become an endeavour in its own right and does not warrant detailed\n31\nexploration here. From this point on we use the term management learning (ML) to indicate those\nactivities that reflect the domains of both management development and management education\npractice. Adult education (AE), on the other hand, refers to educational activities that are (in theory at\nleast) open to all adults, and management learning is one subset of these.\nReferences\nAckers, P. and Preston D.
