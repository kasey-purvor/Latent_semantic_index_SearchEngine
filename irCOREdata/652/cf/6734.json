ISBN 0-335-19791-4. 161 pages, paperback. No price indicated.\nContributions to this review are by Ray McAleese, Betty Collis, Gabriel Jacobs, Bridget Somekh and\nTom King.\nThis composite review is intended to give\nreaders a number of different perspectives on an\nimportant book. The technique, which was used\nin an earlier ALT-J review (in Volume 4 Number\n2, 1996, pages 61-72), is a development of what\nSpiro et al (1988) call 'traversing the terrain'.\nEach reader will bring to a book bis or her own\nperspective, each of which may be a legitimate\nway of making sense of the ideas and arguments\nit contains. In order to give ALT-J readers a\nsense of others' views, we asked three different\nreviewers to consider the book, each from a\ndifferent standpoint. Betty Collis, who has\nwritten extensively on educational innovation\nand new media has taken a pedagogical point of\nview. Gabriel Jacobs, Editor of ALT-J and a\nprolific writer on educational media, has taken\na technical view. Bridget Somekh, recently\nappointed as Dean of Education at\nHuddersfield University and an internationally\nknown educational researcher and writer on\nevaluation methodology, has taken a general\nphilosophical view. Each of these views -\npedagogical, technical and philosophical -\nrepresents one way of reading Managing\nChange in Higher Education: there are of course\nother ways, and readers will have their own\npoints of view. To complete the multiple\nperspective, the Editor of the book, Tom King\nfrom the Interactive Learning group at ICL,\nwas asked to respond to the reviewers'\ncomments. His role was not to be so much to\nrebut others' remarks but to give a fresh\nimpetus to the initial arguments in the book.\nThis leaves my role. I am a teacher and\nresearcher in Higher Education with an interest\nin thinking, educational innovation and\nlearning technology. In order to encourage a\ncritical approach to the book, to the reviews\nand to Tom King's response, I have annotated\nthe multiple review. Using a Socratic irony\ntechnique indicated by the questions and\nanswers, my aim has been to suggest to the\nreader other lines of enquiry and ideas not\nraised by the invited reviewers. My intention\nhas not been to leave readers with no thoughts\nof their own, but rather to facilitate a mental\n'polylogue' of ideas, claims, criticisms and\nevidence. To promote this approach, ALT will\npublish any reader's comments, questions,\nextended criticisms or 'reviews' concerning this\nbook and the reviews and comments below, on\nthe Aur-Electronica Web page. (http:\/\/www.\nwarwick.ac.uk\/alt-E) Readers should email\ncomments, etc. to me (r.mcaleese@ hw.ac.uk)\nor to Jay Dempster, Manager of ALT-E\n(j.dempster@warwick.ac.uk), indicating in the\nheader that the message is a comment on\nManaging Change in Higher Education.

A: I doubt if any of us explicitly\naccept this responsibility.\nQ: Is this not a common reaction to new ideas?\nQ: Why should this matter? Surely we all value\ndifferent perspectives? Do we really expect a\nsingle magic bullet, a unifying story that is\nunambiguously clear to the reader from the\nbeginning?\nQ: Is it the two-dimensional nature of the model\nthat is a problem here? A: I am thinking of\nfractals, recursive events that in a systems model\nwill sometimes be process, sometimes product.\nPedagogical perspective\nI was asked to review this book from a\npedagogical perspective. I interpret this as from\nthe perspective of a Faculty member not only\nresponsible for my own teaching and its peda-\ngogy, but also involved professionally and as a\nresearcher in the broader issues involved with\nimproving the quality of the learning experience\nin Higher Education. From all of these\nperspectives, I was pleased to be asked to\nreview this book, with such a promising title\nand pedigree. Yet when I read it, I was\nsurprised to feel a negative impression growing\nupon me as I found myself going through a\ntransition from reading with optimism to\nploughing through with frustration. Why this\nresponse (which remained after a second\nreading)? First a few general comments.\nI appreciate very much the effort of the team,\nand the careful attempts that were made to\ndecompose and analyse. But once this task was\ntaken on, the obligation of the Editor of the\nbook (whose name is not indicated) better to\nharmonize the different chapters becomes\nstronger. Although the general Figure 1.1 is\nused throughout as an organizer, the figure\nitself is unpacked differently in the different\nchapters, with .different diagrams, sometimes\ndifferent use of terms, and sometimes an\noverlap between concepts without a successful\nattempt to reconcile the overlap. As just a few\nexamples, the terms method and architecture\nthemselves reappear in a recursive manner not\nonly to describe the entire system but also\ncomponents within it. Figure 1.1, as the key\nexplanatory diagram for the book, is labelled as\ndescribing 'the method' but shows 'the method'\nas an input into itself. Similarly, the key terms\narchitecture and infrastructure are used in\ndifferent ways in different chapters (compare\n'the architecture' supposedly shown in Figure\n1.1 with 'the architecture' which is described in\nChapter 9, and with 'architecture' which\nappears to be used as a process-verb in Chapter\n6 (see Figures 6.1 and 6.2)). This frustration was\nparticularly felt when trying to understand the\ndiscrete boxes in Figure 1.1 that are labelled\n'business object' and 'workplace'. My\nsuggestion would have been that (portions of)\nChapters 5, 6 and 8 should be reworked in one\nconsistent discussion, (portions of) Chapters 6\nand 9 into another, and that terms in Chapters\n1 and 6 should be harmonized, as well as in\nChapters 2 and 4. Also, descriptions of\nprocesses should be harmonized, such as those\n65\nReviews\nfor learning-materials development (compare\nChapters 5, 6, and 9, with their sometimes\ndifferent and sometimes similar diagrams, such\nas those for what is called 'chunk development'\non pages 78-82 and 'application development'\non pages 122-126).\nThe multitudinous diagrams also lose their\nsupport value very quickly, especially when\nthey deal with overlapping topics in different\nways, and when their graphic elements are not\nalways consistent with the surrounding text.\nChapter 9 was particularly frustrating in this\nregard, as for example the fact that at one point\nin the chapter, 'interpersonal communication\ntools', 'resource discovery and access tools' and\n'learning chunk evaluation tools' are illustrated\nas discrete from each other and from the\ncategory 'learning tools', but a few pages later\nin the chapter under the subhead Learning\nTools appears Table 9.1 labelled 'Learning\nTools' but which contains within it many\nexamples of 'interpersonal communication\ntools' and 'resource discovery and access tools'.\nWhat the obscure 'learning chunk evaluation\ntools' are, I still do not know. This is only one\nexample out of many that I noted. When a\nbook sets itself the task of careful\ndecomposition, editing is needed to maintain\nthe expectations of the reader.\nAdding to the confusion for the external reader\nis the rather mysterious OPENframework to\nwhich regular reference is made, but no clear\nexplanation given. The buzz-word feel that one\ngets about the framework is not helped by the\nfact that it (whatever it is) is the copyright of\nICL (who also happen to hold the copyright to\nthis book), and that the references given to the\nframework for the reader to fall back on seem\nto be available only on a CD-ROM published\nby the same company and, for the reviewer, not\nlikely to be conveniently accessible. For a\nscholarly book aimed at scholarly readers, this\nis rather weak conceptual backing.\nThe use of occasionally strange and quite\nawkward terminology such as qualities instead\nof criteria, business objects instead of learning\nmaterials, and trading partners to describe what\nseems to include groups as disparate as research\ncouncils and the Government (the labels used in\nChapter 7 of 'influencers' and 'related agencies'\nare more descriptive), appears to have its roots\nin the mysterious OPENframework vocabulary.\nThere is no evidence given to the reader to\nindicate why this OPENframework should be\n\/ am beginning to think that this reviewer would\nnot be happy with the book even it were to be re-\nwritten. Q: Can one get into a frame of mind\nwhere the language and conceptual framework\noffered is so challenging that one is unable to see\nwhat is signified from the signs? Can the signs be\nso dominant in a framework as to eliminate what\nis being signified?\nQ: How can the writer share with the reader\nprivate or tacit assumptions? A: In this case, the\nreader is asked to 'buy into' the status and rigour\nof ICL's OPENframework. I must say I had the\nsame reaction, but I feel that the vocabulary and\nsystems model offered is worth more thought.\n66\nALT-] Volume 5 Number 2\naccepted as the basis for any further analysis.\nThe list of benefits claimed for the use of the\nmodel (page 3) also smacks of something more\nlike a commercial than a scientific document.\nThe superficial Steps 1-4 in the final chapter\n('[...] appoint a senior manager as \"owner\" of\nthe architecture', page 135) do not help dispel\nthis feeling.\nHowever, my task is the pedagogical\nperspective. What did I find of particular\ninterest as a long-time instructor in Higher\nEducation and as a researcher in the application\nof technologies in such instruction? I cannot say\nI feel particularly helped. Why?\nFirst, the Open University influence on the\nthinking about pedagogy is strong. The lengthy\nand formalized processes for 'learning chunk\ndevelopment' described in Chapter 5 (with its\n'gooseberry model', a particularly alienating\ndecision for terminology) on pages 70-88 in\nChapter 6, and 122-128 in Chapter 9, all reflect\nthe team-approach to learning-materials\ndevelopment often described by the Open\nUniversity and other distance-education\ninstitutions, based on a learning-materials\napproach to course design. But as the author of\nChapter 7 points out, quite accurately from the\nperspective of course-material development at\nmost universities of the non- distance type,\n'traditionally the creation of learning material\n[. . .] is an individual endeavour. A [. . .] team\napproach to the task is rare' (p. 98). The\nunderlying assumption, that good teaching\nmeans making the teacher as unnecessary as\npossible through replacing her with waves of\nothers, with teams of course developers\n('learning chunk developers'), supported by\ntutors and other support persons, all revolving\naround self-contained and detailed study\nmaterials (gooseberry fillings, perhaps?), is the\nassumption of only some distance-teaching\ninstitutions and some instructional designers.\nThe many distance-teaching institutions which\nemphasize the centrality of a good instructor\nand good real-time interaction between the\ninstructor and students start with a different\nassumption. As an instructor, as well as a\nresearcher of pedagogy in Higher Education, I\ndo not believe that the changes pushing Higher\nEducation as outlined in Chapter 2 mean\nnecessarily that the instructor should disappear\ninto an anonymous position as only a member\nof an equally anonymous team (or is it 'work\nQ: What would I do in this situation? A: I do not group'?). I agree that the aspects of pedagogy\nfind it easy to collaborate with others as I often described as learning processes in Appendix C\n67\nReviews\nwill be augmented in an increasingly diverse\nvariety of ways in the future, but not necessarily\nthat the instructor will cease to be important in\nmany of these ways. Along with modules and\nteacher-free learning experiences, Faculty\nmembers will still be instructors leading courses\nand class sessions, and responsible for\nstimulating, moderating and evaluating their\nstudents' work. This book does not seem really\nto acknowledge this; and when it does, it is in a\nnegative sense, implying that such antiquated\nand inadequate things as lectures really must\ndisappear (see page 73). Not only is the course-\ndevelopment team approach not viable for the\ntraditional university on cultural and\norganizational grounds, but also it should be\nseen as a complementary, not an evolutionarily\nsuperior, form of course development\ncompared to that of the Faculty member as\ncontent expert, course developer, and teacher\ncombined.\nA second main impression from the pedagogy\nperspective relates to a similar underlying\nassumption which also is never clearly\nacknowledged as such. As I read the detailed\nprocedures for learning-material design and\ndevelopment (no, I will never call them\n'learning chunks', thank you), I see classic\ninstructional-systems design assumptions: that\ngood learning materials have clear objectives\nspecified in detailed terms ahead of time for the\nstudent and that can be assessed for mastery at\ncompletion. Such a view of learning is not\ncompatible with the goals for higher-level\ncritical and creative thinking and for\nmaturation into a scientific community that\nmany of us have for our students. Such aims are\nnot 'met' by working through a module, cannot\nbe concretized into measurable steps, and often\nare not 'met' at all, but only gradually\ndeveloped. The initiation of the student into the\nprofessional and scientific community is a long\nprocess with many sub-aspects in which\nscaffolding and mentoring by the interested\nFaculty member can and should be an\nimportant component. Gaining insight and\nwisdom as well as depth, growing from a\nstudent asking 'What precisely to I have to\nknow for the test?' to a young professional who\ncan solve problems in ways not anticipated by\nthe instructor: this, to me, is the overriding goal\nthat I have for my students. It is also the core\nproblem of modules and credit transfers, and\neven courses, in Higher Education. Reconciling\na Fordist (Henry Ford) assembly-line approach,\ndo not really know what I want to achieve until I\ntry something out. I feel a constraint implicit in\nthe book that this reviewer has put her finger on.\nQ: Why do I like lectures (giving, not\nattending)? A: Perhaps it is the performance\nfactor; perhaps that one cannot really understand\nsomething until one has to make it public or\nexplicit; perhaps that I do not readily share\nothers' assumptions and like to do my own thing;\nperhaps that it is the very social and human\naspect of lecturing, where there are listeners \u00abh\nmy presence, that allows me to think more\neffectively.\n68\nAn-j Volume 5 Number 2\nQ: Am I reconciled with 'market forces'? A: I\nfeel I can benefit my institution by accepting the\nnature of the market, but I do not like to be\ncompetitive and to win contracts. However, who\npays the piper perhaps calls the tune.\nwith its 'quality control standards' and the\ndecomposition of learning into discrete\nobjectives that can be mastered and\ndemonstrated on a test, with the nurturing of a\nlearning experience in which the student gains\nmaturity and insight and self-sufficiency, is our\ncontinued problem in Higher Education. I sense\nlittle feeling for the human dynamics of\neducation in this book.\nPerhaps this is my main point from the\npedagogical perspective: I miss the sense of\nhuman interaction that can be so important to\nour core 'business process'. In fact, I miss\npedagogy. I am glad to read, on page 65, that\n'student learning is the core business process'\nfor Higher Education, because this does not\ncome out very clearly in many of the chapters\nand charts and diagrams and lines and arrows\nand boxes and gooseberries, otherwise in the\nbook. However, even my relief at reading that\nsentence about student learning was tempered\nquickly when I looked to the glossary to see just\nhow 'business process' was defined (important\nto make sense out of Chapter 6). What I read in\nthat definition ('Business process: A defined set\nof tasks and responsibilities, carried out by\npeople or systems, that can be used repeatedly,\nand can be directly related to the objectives of\nthe business') washes me into the company of\nthose who want to model business objects,\ninteract with trading partners, and be managers\nof enterprises advised by OPENframework\ngurus. It washes me away from the students\nwith whom I work and occasionally struggle\nwith, and with whom I occasionally come to\nhave wonderful moments of intellectual\ninteraction. It washes me away from pedagogy.\nA world of gooseberries and 'learn places' and\n'learning chunks' and trading partners and\nbusiness processes is not what I will see today as\nI go to teach and interact with my students,\neven as I use learning materials to support and\nextend this interaction.\nBetty Collis, Faculty of Educational Science and\nTechnology, University of Twente, The Nether-\nlands\nTechnical perspective\nWhen I was a student in the 1960s, a book like\nthis would have been all but inconceivable. It\ncalls higher-education institutions 'enterprises'.\nThey have 'business performance goals', external\nforces are 'business pressures', funding councils\nare 'trading partners'. Yes, times have changed,\n69\nReviews\nand I suppose that this book offers a practical\nresponse to the new market forces. One might\nquestion some of the assumptions the authors\nmake, such as that in traditional learning-models\nstudents have always been viewed as passive\nreceptacles of knowledge. [10] A glance at the\nlong history of educational models shows this\nnot to be so (Socrates, St. Augustine, Vives,\nLocke, Barclay, Comenius, Rousseau,\nPestalozzi, Spencer, Dewey, Montessori,\nAnatole France, Whitehead, Vygotsky, Papert,\nBruner). And it is all very well for the authors of\nthe book to talk of encouraging deep rather than\nsurface processing of information, but that does\nnot necessarily square up with what industry\nmay require, whatever some of its captains say -\nan honest 19th-century American industrialist\nonce stated that successful industry depended on\nuneducated, unthinking men who would work\nfor a dollar a day and never complain. No\ncomment. . . except to say that the issue is not\nstraightforward, and not treated in this book.\nNevertheless, the book does address - often\nquite shrewdly and through the presentation of\nits proposed OPENframework architecture for\nlearning - many important institutional\nquestions, and does suggest answers, even if they\nare not all necessarily the ones I might have\ngiven.\nAt the technical level, those answers (provided\nmostly in Chapter 9 entitled 'Technical system')\nare convincing, but it is difficult to decide at\nwhom the chapter is really aimed. The first\nstated target readership of the book is senior\nhigher-education managers, many of whom are\nnot technically knowledgeable; so one would\nexpect the chapter to deal with the issues at the\nlevel of the lay person. This turns out to be only\npartly the case. A comprehensive eight-part\nlayered IT system is described (user-interface,\napplication architectures, distributed services,\ninformation management, application develop-\nment, systems management, networking and\nplatforms). However, some of the detail will be\nbeyond the average Vice-Chancellor (but too\nelementary for the computer specialist, who is\nalso a stated target reader), and the language\nused is sometimes thoughtless. Let me take two\nexamples among many. We are told that FTP\n'facilitates structured data files across a\nnetwork'. Facilitates? And what, to a lay\nperson, is a 'structured' data file? Or again,\ndoes the fact an FDDI network consists of two\ncounter-rotating fibre-optic rings carry much\nweight with an institutional decision-maker? On\n\/ am glad this reviewer makes this point. I cannot\nhelp but feel the authors of the book have stopped\ntheir thinking in the agricultural model of\nlearning (tending and harvesting ideas on ground\nof different qualities), and that they will soon\naccept a more twentieth-century model: the\narchitectural model (the teacher designs the\nframework, the learning engineer - courseware\ndesigner - implements the plan, and the structure\nis what is specified my the customer (the\nemployer). Umm...\nQ: Why can our senior managers not learn to\nspeak like me? A: As a learning technologist, I\ncan easily express my intentions and design\nconceptions, my enabling strategies and share my\nepistemic models with anyone who cares to listen.\nWell...\n70\nALT-] Volume 5 Number 2\nQ: Will this reviewer also send copies of this\nreview to the VC? Or would the explicit criticism\nof the book's language and managerial model be\ntoo much? Do we always tell others what we\nreally think, or just allow them to form their own\nopinions based on what we hope they see?\nthe other hand, the chapter has extremely useful\nsections on tools for learning and for accessing\ninformation, and on designing, implementing\nand assessing the right IT set-up for a given\ninstitution. In short, the good parts of the\nchapter, which are very good, are contained in\nadvice specific to educational establishments.\nI shall recommend this book to my library\ndespite my criticisms, and I shall send my\nreview copy to the VC of my institution. This is\nbecause the authors rightly present a powerful\ncase for deciding immediately to meet the\nchallenges of the new education market, and\noffer detailed advice on how to go about the\nbusiness of meeting them. I choose those\nmanagement terms, central to my own\ndiscipline, with sadly resigned acceptance.\nGabriel Jacobs, European Business School,\nUniversity of Wales Swansea\nQ: Does that mean it is useful? A: No. I suppose\nthat a practical book might give me the tools I\nneed to accomplish a job or analyse a problem. I\nsuspect that I must accept the appropriateness of\nthe analysis and the tools to make them useful.\nI did like the 'What next' sections and the\nsummaries. I was even tempted to skip the\nPhilosophical perspective\nThis book is the result of an innovative\npartnership between academia and the world of\nbusiness. Its authors have worked together over\na considerable period of time to produce a\npractical handbook for organizational change.\nThe structures of UK higher-education\ninstitutions are described and analysed within a\nframework of key ideas and theories for\neffective business management. First and\nforemost, this is a modernist book which\npresents a grand narrative of salvation: it\nrecommends that Higher Education should be\nviewed as a service industry and run as a\ncommercial enterprise. The book's strategy is to\npresent a generic framework for action capable\nof being customized to produce a detailed\naction plan for managing change in any\nparticular higher-education organization.\nThe tone of the book is didactic because\nessentially it sets out to provide answers to\nquestions. It is presented in a structured format\nbased on a diagrammatic representation of the\n'learning environment architecture'. This is\npresented in full in the introduction, and each\nsubsequent chapter highlights some of the 20 or\nso key concepts which make it up (for example,\n'business process', 'workplace', 'product'), and\ndiscusses how they should be approached and\nmanaged. Most chapters end with a summary\nof key ideas within a section entitled 'What\nnext?'.\nThe great strength of the book is its usability.\n71\nReviews\nIn the tradition of grand narratives, it is also\nadmirably comprehensive. Organizational\nchange is nearly always essential but difficult,\nand this book provides managers in Higher\nEducation with a checklist of things which\nought to be considered. At first sight, nothing is\nleft out. But the weakness of the book lies, also,\nin its certainties. The ideology of the market-\nplace may not always be appropriate to\nhigher-education organizations. The jargon of\n'learning chunks' is perhaps unnecessarily,\nalmost aggressively, inelegant; and what is to be\ngained by the marketease of calling a higher-\neducation workplace a 'learn place'? The brief\nbibliography which replaces what would be the\nreferences in an academic text confirms that the\nwork of some important change theorists, such\nas Fullan (1991, 1993) Argyris (1992) and\nMorgan (1986), has been ignored. There is no\nmicro-political analysis, no awareness of the\nmultiple realities of phenomenology or the\nsubtleties of interpretativism, and no hint of the\ndisorder of a post-modern world. This is a book\nwritten for the managers of organizations that\nseem to lack the tensions and power struggles of\nhuman group-interaction as we experience them\nday-to-day.\nThe environmental architecture, is best seen as\na model rather than a fully rounded\nhypothetical case. Like all good models, the\noverall structure and shape have been\nsharpened up to enable clarification of\nconcepts. The book should be used with this in\nmind, without any false assumption that the\nframework will match any one real case.\nI recommend this book for its practical utility. I\nsuspect that, by contrast, it may also serve to\nmake many readers more aware of the strengths\nof those books which explore complex ideas in\ndetail, in the best academic tradition of critical\nscholarship.\nBridget Somekh, Faculty of Education,\nUniversity of Huddersfield\nBook editor's view\nRecently I joined the newly formed Lifelong\nLearning Unit in ICL, which had recognized\nmany of the overwhelming forces for change\noperating across all sectors of education. I was\ninvited to evaluate whether the principles of\nOPENframework, ICL's developed methodo-\nlogy for managing organizational change, could\nbe appropriately applied to UK higher-\neducation institutions. I set out to do this by\ncontent and just go for the summaries. Q: What\nwould I miss if I were simply to read the\nconclusion in research papers? A: A lot of tedious\ndetail, and I suppose the explanation of why\nthings are as they are described\nQ: What is the difference between a model and a\nframework? A: The certainty with which the\nproponent anticipates counter frameworks. I\nthink this is a model. There seems little\nuncertainty about the correctness of the analysis.\n72\nALT-} Volume 5 Number 2\nQ: What was I thinking about frameworks? A:\nPerhaps the OPENframework is more\nprescriptive than I thought.\nwriting a 'specialization' of OPENframework,\nbased on UK Higher Education, as we had\nsuccessfully done previously for other 'business'\nsectors like retail and local government.\nTo achieve a new framework, it was essential to\nbase it on an understanding of the issues being\nfaced by UK higher-education institutions. I\nwas delighted to be able to bring together a\nteam of authors which included a number of\npractising academics with a range of different\nbackgrounds and perspectives. I had the role of\nfacilitator and, by default, that of Editor. ICL's\nmotivations have always been transparent, as\nevidenced by our sending at least three\ncomplementary copies to every higher-\neducation institution in the UK. We also sent\ncopies to all Vice-Chancellors, Principals and\nLibrarians, and those in charge of IT services.\nWith regard to the language used in this\nframework commented on by the reviewers,\nafter great initial concern I was very pleased to\nfind that the academics on the team had no\ndifficulty with it and, later, it did not seem to be\na problem to those who responded to an\ninvitation to evaluate our final draft before\npublication. The academics in the team were\nfocused on addressing the issues from a higher-\neducation perspective, and had no axe to grind\nabout OPENframework in particular or ICL in\ngeneral. As far as they are concerned, the book\nis offered as an aid to thinking about the issues,\nnot as a commercial blueprint to be religiously\nimplemented by institutions. In response to the\ncomments made by the reviewers, I would like\nto put forward the claims below as strong ideas\nwhich the book encourages people to consider.\nThe opportunities for change and development\nare limited by organizational structures. Some, if\nnot most, of our higher-education institutions\nare likely to have to make quite major changes to\nthe way they are organized - their business\nprocesses - if they are to survive and flourish in\nthe future. There are limits to the changes that\ncan be achieved in an evolutionary manner. New\nbusiness processes will have to be established.\nThe loose coupling that exists in most\ninstitutions between educational resources, for\nexample libraries, computing services and\neducational provision such as courses and\nmodules, only works well in a stable, unchang-\ning environment. Since external factors\n(funding, demographic change, increasing\nenrolments) have undermined stability, there is\na strong need to find a way to relate resources\n73\nReviews\nto provision much more directly so as to ensure\noptimum use of resources.\nAll higher-education institutions have\nambitions to reach new markets in this\ndirection. Whether their academic staff\nrecognize it or not, educational provision needs\nto be made more flexible. Modularization is a\nstep in this direction, but the key to exploiting\nnew markets will be putting the right\neducational offerings. Re-use has to become the\nnorm, and re-use becomes easier where small,\nclearly defined building blocks, 'learning\nchunks', have been assembled.\nThe application of IT and other technologies to\nsupport learning will make a positive difference if\nthey are designed to take account of the needs of\nthe learning environment (objectives, processes\nand people) and offer scope for future change.\nTom King, ICL Interactive Learning\nQ: What makes the writer use IT as a term\ndescribing the artefacts rather than the systems\napproach that models teaching, learning and the\nflow of information? Has he ever 'unpacked' 'IT,\nor does it carry with it a communications-\ntechnology framework?\nI wonder if any of the authors or reviewers have read Stafford Beer or Gordon Pask on cybernetics. I\nsuppose Jay Forrester has a lot to say about the interactions between entities in such a complex\nframework. Q: How can I use the new perspective Ford and his colleagues have provided without\naccepting the validity of their arguments and vocabulary? A: I would have a look at Bernard Scott\n(1974), 'The cybernetics of Gordon Pask. Parts 1 and 2', International Cybernetics Newsletter,\n327-491, if I could get hold of it, or look for some of Jay Forrester's more accessible writings. I shall\nleave Pask's own writings until I get used to using 'learn place'!\nEditorial note\nI cannot resist this: Yes, I have read Stafford Beer, perhaps because his office is next door but one to\nmine.
