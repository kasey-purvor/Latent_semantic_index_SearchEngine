Biomass estimates from a swept \narea method ranged from 4462 tonnes to 28740 tonnes on the South Georgia and Shag \nRock shelves although few fish were caught at Shag Rocks.

The diet \nwas comprised of fish and crustaceans, with an ontogenetic shift in diet from \nEuphausia superba and mysids to benthic fish and decapods observed to begin at 250 \nmm TL.  In larger fish (> 500 mm TL) the diet was dominated by fish.  C. aceratus \ndiet is sufficiently different from the other species of channichthyids around South \nGeorgia to suggest that these species have undergone resource partitioning. \n 2\n \nIntroduction \nDemersal fish assemblages in the Southern Ocean are dominated by the perciform \nsuborder Notothenioidae (Gon & Heemstra 1990; Eastman 2005).  The notothenioids \ninclude 6 familes, one of which, the Family Channichthyidae, lacks the respiratory \npigment haemoglobin and are known as the icefish (Everson 1984; Eastman 1991; \nKock and Everson 1997; Koch 2005).  The channnichthyids include 15 species, 3 of \nwhich (Champsocephalus gunnari, Pseudochaenichthys georgianus and \nChaenocephalus aceratus) are abundant around South Georgia.  The Scotia Sea or \nblack-fin icefish, Chaenocephalus aceratus L\u00f6nnberg 1906, is found from South \nGeorgia to the northern part of the Antarctic Peninsula in the Atlantic sector of the \nSouthern Ocean and at Bouvetoya Island (Permitin 1977; Iwami and Kock 1990).  It \nis predominately found in shelf waters to a depth of 450 m with a few individuals \ncaught down to depths of 770 m (Iwami and Kock 1990; Kock 2005).  Mature fish are \nbelieved to move inshore to spawn (Lisovenko 1988), in a seasonal migration that \noccurs from March to May at South Georgia and later further south (Kock and \nKellermann 1991). \n \nThe seas around South Georgia are some of the most productive in the Southern \nOcean (Atkinson et al. 2001) and support large populations of land-based predators \nand commercial fisheries for krill, mackerel icefish and Patagonian toothfish (Agnew \n2004).  Commercial fishing began at South Georgia in the mid-1960s and C. aceratus \nwas caught as by-catch in the mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari) fishery \n(Sosinski and Szlakowski 1992; Kock at al. 2000). Early by-catch levels of C. \naceratus are unknown because by-catches were incompletely reported or unreported \n 3\n(Kock 2005), but in the late 1970s catches of C. aceratus reached over 2000 tonnes, \npeaking in 1977\/78, when 2066 tonnes were caught in a targeted fishery (CCAMLR \n1990).  Biomass estimates in the 1980s suggested that the virgin stock of C. aceratus \nhad declined by 40 % (Kock 1991).  Since 1982 the fisheries at South Georgia have \nbeen managed under the auspices of the Commission for the Conservation of \nAntarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) and following a poor season in \n1990\/91 commercial trawl fishing at South Georgia was prohibited.  The mackerel \nicefish fishery resumed in 1992\/3, but was restricted to pelagic trawling with strict by-\ncatch limits set by CCAMLR.  Under CCAMLR\u2019s ecosystem approach to \nmanagement (Constable et al. 2000) stocks are managed conservatively, to ensure \nsustainability, but the impacts on non-target and dependent species are also taken into \naccount in setting catch levels.  As a by-catch in both the krill and mackerel icefish \nfisheries (Agnew 2004; Everson et al. 1992) C. aceratus is vulnerable to exploitation \nat different stages of its life cycle and developing a better understanding of its ecology \nwill help underpin sustainable management. \n \nRecent studies on the ecology of C. aceratus have focussed on age and growth (La \nMesa et al. 2004) and diet (Flores et al. 2004) from samples collected around the \nSouth Shetland Islands.  Earlier studies of the South Georgia population have \nfocussed on growth (Kompowski 1990), reproduction (Lisovenko 1988) and diet \n(Target 1981; McKenna 1991), although sample sizes have been limited.  The aim of \nthis investigation is to synthesise biological data collected on C. aceratus during 14 \ndemersal trawl surveys around South Georgia over a 19-year period.   This long-term \ndata set will be used to estimate growth and size at maturity and examine inter-annual \nvariability in abundance.  In addition data on diet was collected from the last two \n 4\nsurveys in the series.  Knowledge of abundance, growth and diet are important in both \nfisheries management and in understanding the ecological role of this species. \n \nMaterials and methods \nSample collection \nResearch surveys around the South Georgia and Shag Rocks shelves are summarised \nin Table 1.  A random stratified design, with three depth strata (<150 m; 151-250 m; \n>250 m) was used in all years except 2003.  In 2003 trawls were made along radial \ntransects away from South Georgia encompassing depths from 100 m to 900 m.  Each \ntrawl was fished for 30 minutes on the sea floor, at a speed of 4 knots with a \ncommercial sized otter trawl (see Everson et al. 1999), with a headline height of 4-6 \nm, a wingspread of approximately 18 m and a cod-end mesh of 40 mm.   \n \nCatch sorting and processing \nFish caught in demersal trawls were sorted into species, with total catch of each \nspecies determined using spring balances (pre 2000) or motion compensated scales.  \nRandom sub-samples (~200) of Chaenocephalus aceratus were collected from trawl \ncatches and were measured to the nearest 10 mm total length (TL) below.  Fish weight \nwas measured to the nearest gram, sex was determined and maturity stage assigned \n(following Kock and Kellermann 1991).  In 2005 and 2006 stomachs were removed, \nplaced in zip lock bags and frozen at -20oC for later processing. \n \nStomach analysis \nStomachs were defrosted before analysis.  Stomach contents were separated into \ndifferent species or species groups.  Prey items were identified to the lowest \n 5\ntaxonomic level using relevant literature (Gon and Heemstra 1990; Reid 1996) and \nreference specimens.  Heavily digested fish were identified by their sagittal otoliths.  \nEach prey item was weighed to the nearest 0.01 g and measured using electronic \ncallipers or a ruler.  The TL of highly digested fish was estimated using otolith-length \nrelationships (Reid 1996).   \n \nData analysis \nFor each catch fish density was estimated using the mass of the catch, distance \ntrawled and horizontal opening of the net.  Biomass estimates were obtained using the \nTrawlCI programme, which uses Aitchison\u2019s delta distribution to generate unbiased \nestimates of abundance with confidence intervals (de al Mare 1994).   The input data \nwere the individual densities for each trawl, stratified by depth zone and the sea-floor \narea for each depth strata, which was taken from Everson & Campbell (1991).   \n \nLength frequency analysis was undertaken using the software \u201cMIX\u201d (Macdonald and \nGreen 1979), implemented in \u201cR\u201d as \u201cRMIX\u201d (Du 2002).  For each year\u2019s data the \nnumber of components (cohorts) and initial estimates of component means were \nestimated from length-frequency plots and used as input parameters.  \u201cRMIX\u201d outputs \nwere constrained to have a constant co-efficient of variation (standard deviation \nproportional to the mean) and were run from different starting parameters to find the \noptimal solution (minimising chi-squared).  The resultant means were assigned an age \nrelating to the length frequency distribution assuming that the larvae hatched on 1st \nSeptember (BAS, unpublished data).  To provide information on younger age classes, \nthe mean size of larval and juvenile C. aceratus caught from plankton sampling \naround South Georgia were included.  Larvae came from two sources: sampling in \n 6\nCumberland East Bay, South Georgia during September and October (2001 to 2006) \nand from RRS James Clark Ross samples (March 2004) collected to the north west of \nSouth Georgia.  A von Bertalanffy growth curve was fitted (using Sigma Plot 9.0) to \nthe mean sizes of each cohort by following cohort progression and assuming similar \nsized fish in different years were the same age.   \n  \nLength-mass relationships and length at first spawning were examined.  The \nrelationship between length and mass was calculated for each sex independently and \nfor both sexes combined.  The length at which 50 % of the population spawns for the \nfirst time (L50) was estimated by fitting a logistic curve to the cumulative frequency of \nindividuals of maturity stage 3 and greater.  L50 was estimated for both sexes. \n \nDiet was expressed as percentage number (%N), mass (%M), frequency (%F) and \npercent index of relative importance (%IRI) following Cortes (1996).  Curve fitting \nroutines and regression analyses were undertaken in Sigma Plot 9.0. \n \nResults \nBiomass and distribution \nChaenocephalus aceratus was caught in 88.6 % of trawls on the South Georgia shelf \ncompared to 7.5 % of trawls at Shag Rocks (Figure 1), and estimates of biomass of C. \naceratus were considerably higher on the South Georgia shelf than around Shag \nRocks (Table 2).  In many surveys C. aceratus was absent in trawls around Shag \nRocks.  The confidence intervals associated with biomass estimates were particularly \nlarge in 1997\/98 and 1998\/90, due to some large catches and zero catches in the sane \ndepth strata.  Biomass estimates in the late 1980s and through the 1990s were \n 7\ngenerally higher than the 2000s.  From 2000 onwards estimated biomass has not \nexceeded 10 000 tonnes.  The greatest biomass around South Georgia is found \nbetween 150 m to 250 m. \n \nLength composition and growth parameters \nA total of 28342 Chaenocephalus aceratus were measured ranging from 120 mm to \n760 mm TL.  Not all these individuals were sexed.  Females attained a larger size \n(760 mm TL, n = 5939) than males (610 mm TL, n = 4812).  \n \nDiscrete size modes can be seen within the population in each survey (Figure 2).  The \nfirst three modes were clearly visible in most surveys at approximately 170 mm, 260 \nmm and 350 mm TL.  A fourth and fifth mode were observed at 420 mm and 490 mm \nTL in some of the surveys, but at greater sizes it became difficult to distinguish size \nclasses.  In most surveys \u201cRMIX\u201d picked out the first four or five modes successfully \nbut could not differentiate year classes beyond that point (Table 3). Larvae were \ncaught in September-October (TL~20 mm) and March (TL~70 mm). \n \nThe growth parameters, estimated by fitting a von Bertalanffy growth curve to the \nmean size at age data (Figure 3) were K = 0.152, t0 = -0.069 and L\u221e = 841.  Annual \ngrowth was fast up to five years varying from 61 mm yr-1 to 119 mm yr-1 (Figure 3).  \nBy extrapolating the von Bertalanffy growth curve, the maximum size of fish caught \nin this study (760 mm) was estimated to be 15 years old. \n \n 8\nLength-mass relationship \nMass of males ranged from 10 g to 2000 g (n = 1953) and females ranged from 10 g \nto 3970 g (n = 2146).  The relationship between length (L) and mass (M) is \nsummarised by the following equations below: \nMales: M = 0.0004 TL3.7045 r2 = 0.98, p < 0.0001  \nFemales: M = 0.0003 TL3.8238 r2 = 0.97, p < 0.0001 \nSexes combined: M = 0.0004 TL3.7422 r2 = 0.97, p < 0.0001 \nThese relationships indicate that females weigh more for a given length than males. \n \nMaturity \nStage 1 males and females were caught in the highest numbers followed by stage 2.  \nTogether these stages made up 90 % of males and 78 % of females sampled (n = \n8534).  Only a small percentage of the population had begun to develop gonads for \nspawning within a given year.  L50 for males and females were estimated as 440 mm \nTL and 520 mm TL, respectively (Figure 4), which means male and female C. \naceratus reach sexual maturity at approximately 72 % and 68 % of their maximum \nTL. \n \nThe greatest proportion of stage 1 males and females were caught in the north east \nregion of South Georgia (Figure 5).  In this region the first three year classes were \nstronger than in other areas.  However, the numbers of 1+ individuals were highest in \nthe south east and west of the island.  The greatest numbers of stage 3 individuals \nwere along the east coast of the island.  Within this maturity class there were a greater \nproportion of females than males.  No males were found at stage 4 and less than 1 % \nof females were in this category. \n 9\n \nDiet \nA total of 38 and 110 full or partially full stomachs were analysed from C. aceratus \n(170-690 mm TL) collected during bottom trawling around South Georgia in 2005 \nand 2006, respectively.   \n \nThe diet of C. aceratus was pooled for the two years, as the sample size in 2005 was \nlow and comprised similar species to the 2006 sample (Table 4).  Fish dominated the \nprey by percentage mass (96 %), with nototheniids and channichthyids comprising the \nmajority of the fish diet.   Crustaceans were found more frequently in stomachs (71 \n%), with euphausids, the decapod Notocrangon antarcticus and the mysid \nAntarctomysis spp. being the most common.  The importance of each prey item was \ncalculated by combining %N, %F and % W to produce a %IRI.   \n \nDistinct ontogenetic changes were evident in the diet (Figure 6). Up to 250 mm TL \nthe diet was dominated by krill with Antarctomysis sp. also consumed. At 250 mm TL \na shift in prey species began with benthic decapods and fish appearing in the diet, and \nby 350 mm TL approximately 60 % of the prey was fish and benthic decapods (Figure \n6).  By 450 mm TL fish dominated the stomach contents.  Mackerel icefish were the \nprimary fish prey from 450 to 650 mm TL, and were replaced by Nototheniidae \n(Dissostichus eleginoides, Notothenia gibberifrons and Lepidonotothen larseni) in \nfish > 650 mm TL.  Antarctomysis spp. did not appear in stomach contents of fish \ngreater than 450 mm TL.   \n \nPredator prey relationships \n 10\nOnly one modal length of krill and mysids were found within the stomach of C. \naceratus at any time.  The length of krill and mysids ranged from 32-57 mm and 30-\n45 mm, respectively.  Size of fish ingested increased significantly with the size of \npredator (Pearson\u2019s correlation: r2 = 0.415, d.f. 29, p < 0.001).  Ingested fish ranged in \nsize from 60- 490 mm TL (Figure 7).  C. aceratus was found to consume fish up to 93 \n% of its own body length. \n \nDiscussion \nInformation on the groundfish stocks around South Georgia has been collected \nthrough scientific research since the 1980s (Sosinski and Szlakowski 1992; Everson et \nal. 1999).  Biomass estimates of C. aceratus have shown interannual variability since \nthe late 1980s.  This could be caused by a variety of sources including sampling \nvariability as a result of differences in vessel and gear type (Sosinski and Szlakowski \n1992; Pilling and Parks 1995), natural variability within the ecosystem and fishing \npressure (McKenna and Saila 1991).  Direct fishing on C. aceratus was prohibited in \n1989\/90 (Kock 1991) and since 1988 less than five tonnes per year has been taken as \nby-catch in the mackerel icefish fishery (CCAMLR 1992; CCAMLR 2006), so direct \nfishing pressure is unlikely to be the cause.  Biomass estimates in the late 1980s \nsuggested that the stock was 40 % of its original size (Kock 1991) and the data \npresented here indicate that the population has not recovered to pre-exploitation \nlevels.  This would suggest that factors other than commercial fishing are controlling \nthe population size of C. aceratus. \n \nAdult C. aceratus are benthic predators with fish, particularly C. gunnari, as their \nmain food source.  The biomass of C. gunnari fluctuates dramatically between years \n 11\n(Everson et al. 1999) and may therefore affect food availability for adult C. aceratus \nand may limit energy for reproduction.   Changes in C. gunnari abundance have been \nlinked to variability in its primary prey, Antarctic krill (Everson et al. 1999), which \nare also important in the diet of juvenile and sub-adult C. aceratus (this study; \nKompowski 1980).   The abundance of Antarctic krill at South Georgia is subject to \nconsiderable interannual variability (Brierley et al. 1999), and poor krill years may \nsignificantly reduce the survival of juvenile C. aceratus.  Chaenocephalus aceratus \nare also competing with land-based predators such as Antarctic fur seals and gentoo \npenguins for Antarctic krill and mackerel icefish (Everson et al. 1999). The dramatic \nincrease in the fur seal population since the 1970\u2019s has probably increased that \ncompetition and may, in part, be responsible for the lack of recovery in the C. \naceratus stock. \n \nRecruitment variability is high within C. aceratus.  Some recruitment, however, is \nseen each year but there are noticeable years in which the number of individuals \nrecruiting to the population is much higher.  Sea surface temperature (SST) has been \nlinked to recruitment in mackerel icefish around South Georgia (Hill et al. 2005) and \nPatagonian toothfish on the Shag Rocks shelf (Collins et al. in press).  Hill et al. \n(2005) found that the abundance of juvenile mackerel icefish in the diet of gentoo \npenguins was positively correlated to temperature at the putative spawning time.  C. \naceratus and mackerel icefish are both channichthyids that cover a similar latitudinal \nrange and have very similar life history strategies, which could suggest spawning \ntemperatures may play a role in the determination of year class strength of C. \naceratus. \n \n 12\nLarval retention on the continental shelf may also play an important role in the \nrecruitment of this species.  Interannual variability in the direction of flow and the \nvelocity of the shelf break front or transitional zone could have profound effects on \nlarval distribution and egg transport (Meredith et al. 2005).  C. aceratus make inshore \nmigrations to spawn on the continental shelf (Lisovenko 1988) and there is evidence \nthat they lay benthic eggs (Detrich et al. 2005).  It is therefore likely that pelagic \nlarval stages will be more affected by variability in oceanographic currents than eggs.  \nLength frequency analysis shows a high proportion of 1+ individuals recruiting to the \nsouth of the island and this area may be an important nursery ground before fish \nmigrate to the north east of the island, where there is greater biomass and hence an \nincreased risk of predation by cannibalism. \n \nThere are differences between this study and others in relation to estimates of age \nstructure and growth rate.  Analysis of length frequency distributions by Kompowski \n(1990) on C. aceratus, caught around South Georgia between April and May, found \nmodal lengths of 100 mm, 200 mm, 270 mm, 340 mm and 400 mm.  These were \nbelieved to equate to one to five years old (Kompowski 1990) and, given the different \nsampling months, are consistent with those observed in this study, indicating that C. \naceratus grows quickly in its first 4-5 years (Kompowski 1990).  Similar modes were \nalso apparent in the length frequency data from the South Shetlands (La Mesa et al \n2004), with modes at 150, 250, 310 and 400 mm TL, but interpretation of growth \nrings in otoliths from these fish were not consistent with these modes representing \nyear classes.   \n \n 13\nOur estimate of the growth parameter K, that describes growth rate, is similar to \nKompowski\u2019s (1990) otolith based estimate, but is more than double that of La Mesa \net al. (2004), which was derived from otolith analysis of South Shetlands fish.  La \nMesa et al. (2004) suggested that, if the differences in growth rate (compared to \nKompowski 1990) were real, it could be a consequence of different environmental \nconditions such as temperature or food availability.  Otoliths were examined from fish \ncaught in this study, but no consistent growth pattern was detected (Reid & Belchier \nunpublished), and otoliths of the channichthyids are notoriously difficult to age. To \ndate no validation of the annual deposition of growth rings in C. aceratus otoliths has \nbeen achieved, a problem highlighted by La Mesa et al. (2004).    Clearly a growth \nestimate that combined validated otoliths readings and length frequency analysis \nwould give greater confidence in growth estimates.  However, in a highly seasonal \nenvironment, the clear modes consistently detected in the first three size classes (in all \nthree studies) supports the hypothesis that these are year classes and indicates \nrelatively rapid growth.  \n \nThe diet data presented here provide a snapshot of the diet of C. aceratus in two \naustral summers, but do not take into account any inter-annual or seasonal variability \nin the diet as observed by Koslov et al. (1988). Overall the results are consistent with \nother diet studies on C. aceratus and demonstrate that this species eats a wide range of \nprey items (Targett 1981; Koslov et al. 1988; McKenna 1991; Flores et al. 2004).  \nFocussing on one or two forms of analyses can produce misleading results in relation \nto the importance of specific prey items.  Calculation of either a dietary coefficient \n(Flores et al. 2004) or using a combination of percentage mass, frequency and number \nof prey items to produce a %IRI (Cortes, 1996) makes studies easier to compare.  This \n 14\nstudy agrees with Flores et al. (2004) that C. aceratus starts life as a planktivorous \npredator, becoming an opportunistic benthic predator as it grows. At South Georgia a \nchange in diet begins to appear at 250 to 350 mm TL when C. aceratus are more \nprevalent in demersal trawls.  This change is manifested by a shift in diet from \neuphausids and mysids to benthic fish and decapods.  Together this would suggest a \nchange in foraging behaviour or habitat utilization and will reduce competition for \nfood and decrease the risk of cannibalism between adults and juveniles. \n \nDiet studies aid our understanding of resource partitioning within the ecosystem and \nthe magnitude of the links between different species within the food web (Collins et \nal. in press).  The diet and morphology of C. aceratus and C. gunnari are consistent \nwith different feeding behaviours and habitats (Eastman 1993).  Behavioural and \nmorphology studies have shown that the Scotia Sea icefish is an ambush predator that \nsits on its heavy first pelvic fin rays and waits for moving prey (Fanta et al. 2003).  \nDaily vertical feeding migrations have been observed in mackerel icefish (Trunov et \nal. 2000), which is more streamlined in shape (Iwami and Kock 1990) and lighter than \nC. aceratus (Eastman and Sidell 2002).  The daily migrations of C. gunnari and N. \nlarseni (Trunov et al. 2000), another important prey species, occur at the peak activity \nof adult C. aceratus (Fanta et al. 2003).  C. aceratus use visual and chemical senses to \ntarget moving prey and ignore stationary targets (Fanta et al. 2003).  C. aceratus  \nbenthic foraging strategy allows resources to be partitioned vertically between species \nof icefish (Gr\u00f6hsler 1994) as well as potentially bringing it into contact with its major \nprey after C. gunnari and Lepidonotothen larseni have been foraging.  C. aceratus has \nbeen observed to guard nests at Bouvetoya Island (Dietrich et al. 2005).  A benthic \n 15\nforaging strategy could be more appropriate as they may not leave the nest site for \nlong periods of time to forage in the pelagic realm. \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe would like to thank the captains, crews and scientists who have been involved in \nSouth Georgia and Shag Rocks trawl surveys since 1987.  The first two surveys were \nundertaken as part of the United States Antarctic Marine Living Resources \nProgramme, the third was a joint UK\/Poland survey and the remainder supported by \nthe Government of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. This work was \ncarried out at the British Antarctic Survey Applied Fisheries Laboratory at King \nEdward Point, South Georgia, under contract to the Government of South Georgia and \nthe South Sandwich Islands.
