CHwierotH*\neConoMiC crises often bring about remarkable transformations. Periods of hard times such as the great Depression, the oil and in-\nflationary crises of the 1970s, the debt crises of the 1980s, the emerging \nmarket crises of the 1990s, and the global financial crisis of 2007\u201309, \nare commonly believed to be associated with dramatic change. these \nperiods of dramatic change reveal the importance of economic struc-\ntures, distributive preferences, strategic agency, uncertainty, and belief \nsystems. not surprisingly, the significance of these periods has led a \nnumber of scholars to ask: How do crises lead to change?\none prominent rationalist view is that crises induce change as some \ninexorable structural response.1 rationalists working with open economy \nmodels of politics (oep) depict crises as exogenous shocks that reshape \nthe distribution of domestic political power and permit the newly domi-\nnant coalition to pursue reforms that reflect its distributive preferences.2 \nConstructivists argue that crisis politics is about the endogenous con-\nstruction of new intersubjective beliefs that necessitate change.3\nthere are important limitations to each perspective. first, crises, no \nmatter how visible or severe, do not induce an automatic response. Cri-\nses alter the domestic balance of power and ideas in varying ways that \nbring bargaining, negotiation, and persuasion to the forefront of the \ncrisis resolution process. oep models, while sensible, can often be too \nsparse and too far removed from specific national circumstances to be \n* i am grateful for helpful comments on earlier drafts provided by Vedi Hadiz, John sidel, and \nandrew walter.\n1 stallings 1992.\n2 gourevitch 1986; Haggard and Maxfield 1996.\n3 Blyth 2002; widmaier et al. 2007.\nWorld Politics 62, no. 3 ( July 2010), 496\u2013527\nCopyright \u00a9 2010 trustees of Princeton University\ndoi: 10.1017\/s0043887110000110\n how do crises lead to change? 497\n4 Culpepper 2008.\na useful guide for understanding crisis politics. oep models also remain \nwanting to the extent that crisis resolution cannot be understood simply \nin terms of the domestic power balance and the process of bargaining \nand negotiation. Because crises induce uncertainty that constrains ac-\ntors from fully grasping their distributive preferences, how actors inter-\npret and debate the meaning of material events and incentives as giving \nrise to particular courses of action must also be considered. while not \ndenying the influence of distributive preferences at particular stages of \nthe crisis resolution process, i argue that until uncertainty is reduced, \nthe influence of persuasion relative to bargaining and negotiation is \nheightened as a mechanism of change, as constructivists contend.\nalthough intersubjective belief change shapes the crisis resolution \nprocess, constructivists have thus far not adequately specified the scope \nconditions under which a new idea is likely to win out over others. in \ncases where constructivists do consider this issue, they typically point \nto the need for a new idea to resonate with the preexisting beliefs of \ndomestic elites and the mass public. in other words, they argue that a \nnew idea must be perceived as legitimate within the context of existing \nbelief systems.\nwhile capturing the role of belief systems, this work suffers from \ntwo shortcomings. first, it obscures the influence of external actors and \nthus fails to consider the often decisive impact the perceived need to \nestablish credibility with these actors has on the crisis resolution pro-\ncess. second, it tends to be overly static and structural, focusing on the \npossibility of congruence to the neglect of possibilities for congruence-\nbuilding. this article seeks to rectify these shortcomings.\nCrises lead to change through a three-stage process: crisis, experi-\nmentation, and consolidation.4 in the crisis stage, norm entrepreneurs \nemploy their ideas to implicate the status quo as flawed, usually due to \na severe economic downturn or dramatic failure, and as necessitating \nchange. this construction of a crisis generates uncertainty as to what \nhas gone wrong and how it can be remedied.\nas actors struggle with uncertainty in the experimentation stage, \npersuasion and argumentation take center stage as rival norm entre-\npreneurs and defenders of the status quo offer competing diagnoses. \nonly after actors have reduced uncertainty by settling on a common \ndiagnosis and blueprints for action have been developed, do distribu-\ntive preferences assert themselves. the consolidation stage begins only \nafter a new set of policies and institutions has been created.\n498 world politics \nCrisis resolution thus happens largely in the crisis and experimenta-\ntion stages; this is where i focus my attention. the ideas most likely to \nform the basis of new beliefs depend on four features: the carriers of the \nideas, the composition of the group advocating the ideas, the crossover \nappeal of the ideas, and their credibility with external actors\u2014what i \ncall the \u201cfour Cs\u201d of crisis resolution. Briefly stated, whenever a promi-\nnent and cohesive group of advocates promotes a new idea that has \nsufficient distributive and ideational appeal and the endorsement of \nexternal actors whose seal of approval is perceived as important, inter-\nsubjective belief change is more likely.\ni develop these arguments in the section below and then examine \nthem empirically in the case of the early years of new order indonesia. \ni employ this case to illustrate the mechanisms through which crises \ninduce change. a severe economic downturn in indonesia in the mid-\n1960s led to reforms that culminated in capital account liberalization \nin 1970. at the time, the decision to liberalize the capital account was \nremarkable since, with the exception of Mexico, there were hardly any \ndeveloping countries, or even developed countries, that had taken such \na dramatic step.\nthese reforms have been well documented in studies conducted by \nindonesianists, many of which i rely upon in this analysis.5 while there \nare potential shortcomings to relying extensively on secondary sources, \nmuch of my analysis also employs interviews with and primary docu-\nments from individuals who were prominent policymakers at the time. \nsurprisingly few of the accounts offered by indonesianists make use \nof these sources, perhaps because many of the sources were not made \navailable until the late 1990s\u2014after much of the indonesianist work \non the early years of the new order had already been published. More \nimportantly, the central goal of this article is not to offer a novel com-\nprehensive account of the new order, but rather to use the empirical \nevidence from the case to offer a broader argument about crisis poli-\ntics\u2014one that considers a fuller array of factors together, rather than \nseparately, and that demonstrates how these factors in conjunction lead \nto particular outcomes.\nthere has been much recent work on the strengths and weaknesses \nof case-study analysis relative to statistical and comparative analysis.6 a \nkey goal of my analysis is to investigate the causal mechanisms through \nwhich crises produce change, a goal for which case-study analysis is \n5 see, for instance, Bresnan 1993; Cole and slade 1996; Liddle 1991; Macintyre 1993; Pincus and \nramli 1998; robison 1986; winters 1996.\n6 gerring 2007; george and Bennett 2005.\n how do crises lead to change? 499\nwell-suited but statistical and comparative analysis are not. Case-study \nanalysis permits intensive investigation of a particular outcome, though \nit comes at the expense of extensive generalizability. However, because \nthe focus of my inquiry is in understanding why and how crises gener-\nate change in the way that they do rather than in understanding the \nmagnitude and relative precision of the causal relationship between \ncrises and change, i chose not to engage in cross-national comparison. \nstill, the analysis highlights some spatial and temporal variation within \nthe case as well as several comparative applications of the argument, \nand the conclusion considers its potential scope.\ncrisis resolution: carriers, composition, crossover appeal, \nand credibility\nin normal times, intersubjective beliefs, or common knowledge, con-\nverge on a shared account of the workings of the economy and the \nway they should interrelate. these beliefs permit actors to diagnose \ndysfunctions and identify remedies for them. normal politics may \nconsist of bargaining, negotiation, and debates over changes to the in-\nstruments and settings of policy, but the intersubjective beliefs remain \nunchanged.7 However, even normal politics is characterized by norm \nentrepreneurs operating as voices in the wilderness and waiting for \nopportunities to promote their preferred alternative to the status quo \nthrough a process of \u201cstrategic social construction.\u201d8\n in the crisis stage, the declining performance of status quo insti-\ntutions and policies destabilizes the intersubjective beliefs underlying \nthem. But material events, however, cannot be reduced solely to au-\ntomatic incentives for change. actors\u2019 intersubjective beliefs must first \ninterpret and construct events as a crisis for the status quo that neces-\nsitates change.9\n norm entrepreneurs play an influential role during the crisis phase \nthrough naming and framing practices. they use ideas instrumentally \nas weapons to contest the status quo and delegitimize the beliefs sup-\nporting it. when norm entrepreneurs successfully construct a crisis, \nthe result is uncertainty.10 when the old rules of the game can no lon-\nger be taken for granted, actors seek guidance as to how to understand \nand behave in an unfamiliar situation.\n7 Hall 1993.\n8 finnemore and sikkink 1998, 888.\n9 widmaier, Blyth, and seabrooke. 2007.\n10 Blyth 2002.\n500 world politics \nthe experimentation stage begins with uncertainty as a binding \nconstraint that leads actors to be more receptive to persuasion. with \nprecrisis beliefs destabilized, actors seek a new way first to interpret \ntheir situation and then to remedy it. Crisis politics becomes focused \non creating new intersubjective beliefs. Here the same ideas employed \nas weapons to implicate the precrisis status quo as responsible for the \ncrisis can reduce uncertainty by narrowing possible causes of the crisis \nto a significant degree.\nin some accounts the experimentation stage is depicted as one where \nthe newly dominant coalition has stable distributive preferences that \nit implements through changes to the precrisis status quo.11 Yet these \naccounts also reveal this process as characterized by uncertainty. Pep-\nper Culpepper offers one potential solution, positing that even as ac-\ntors struggle with uncertainty they have \u201csome idea of the distributive \nconsequences of any given institutional choice.\u201d12 But this view is not \nentirely convincing. while distributive preferences do influence particu-\nlar stages of the process, such preferences can come into play only after \nuncertainty has been reduced and alternative remedies have been identi-\nfied.\nUncertainty reduction is temporally prior to any negotiation or bar-\ngaining over remedies since actors must first have some idea what the \ncrisis is and what caused it. absent such ideas, actors cannot rank alter-\nnative remedies. there is, as Culpepper observes, \u201ca real game of figur-\ning out what is going on in the world.\u201d13 even following uncertainty \nreduction, it is not clear that distributive preferences will be decisive, \nsince without any a priori experience with the new institutions and pol-\nicies, actor interests in such institutions and policies will be necessarily \nunderdetermined.14 Persuasion, rather than bargaining and negotiation, \nthus becomes increasingly important as a mechanism for change.\nafter uncertainty is reduced, actors rely on ideas to serve as a blue-\nprint for action and as a coalition-building resource.15 By providing a \ncommon goal for action, these ideas also provide the basis for the for-\nmation of a coalition among entrepreneurs pursuing change. the third \nand final stage, consolidation, emerges only after a new set of policies \nand institutions has been created. to understand how actors resolve \ncrises i therefore focus on the set of scope conditions that facilitates \nintersubjective change in the crisis and experimentation stages.\n11 gourevitch 1986; Haggard and Maxfield 1996.\n12 Culpepper 2008, 6\u20137.\n13 Culpepper 2008, 6.\n14 Blyth 2007.\n15 Blyth 2002.\n how do crises lead to change? 501\nwinning ideas will have the features related to the four Cs of crisis \nresolution. first, the quality of the carrier advocating the idea matters. \nthe appeal of a new idea is enhanced when it is carried by an entrepre-\nneur perceived as prominent or authoritative.16 Hence, expertise derived \nfrom experience, knowledge, training, and credentials can prove to be \nan important asset. Uncertain as to what has gone wrong, actors turn \nto experts, which permits norm entrepreneurs with expert authority to \ndraw on this asset to mobilize crisis arguments that implicate the status \nquo as necessitating change. Because success breeds success, the clout \nand authority of experts can increase (or potentially decrease) when \ntheir prescriptions are perceived to have generated success (or failure).\nsecond, the composition of the advocacy group matters. in promoting \ntheir beliefs, norm entrepreneurs typically confront resistance from de-\nfenders of the status quo as well as from advocates of alternative beliefs. \nin confronting this resistance, a cohesive group characterized by like-\nminded members is in a stronger position than a heterogeneous group \nto persuade, negotiate, and bargain with other actors.17 Cohesion can \nenhance the persuasive power of an advocacy group by ensuring con-\nsistent advice from its members. Cohesion can also shape negotiations \nand bargaining over distributional consequences by helping to insulate \nthe decision-making process from opposing beliefs and demands.\nthird, crossover appeal matters. following uncertainty reduction, \nideas can serve as important coalition-building resources. the likeli-\nhood that an actor will find an idea appealing is partly shaped by its res-\nonance with that actor\u2019s distributive and ideational preferences. Much \nof the work on resonance has focused on the extent to which an idea \nfits with the preferences of domestic elites and the mass public.18 while \ninsightful, this work suffers from two shortcomings.\nthe first of these is that it obscures the influence of external actors. as \nsuch, it fails to give adequate attention to the fourth feature of winning \nideas\u2014that credibility matters. resonance cannot be defined simply in \nterms of domestic elites and the mass public; how remedies fit with the \npreferences of official and private-market actors must also be considered. \nthe perceived need to establish credibility with external actors can thus \ntrump the perceived need to establish legitimacy with domestic actors.\nwhen a government sends a signal, it seeks to communicate to ex-\nternal actors that it shares and is committed to their policy beliefs. But \nby dealing with these beliefs by assumption and focusing on the incen-\n16 finnemore and sikkink 1998.\n17 Chwieroth 2007.\n18 Culpepper 2008; Hall 1989; seabrooke 2007a.\n502 world politics \ntives for action, rationalists often miss out on how these beliefs affect \nthe type of incentives that are generated. sociological institutionalists \nunderstand signalling as a form of \u201cceremonial conformity.\u201d19 But while \nthe perceived need for external legitimacy or resources may be what \ncreates incentives for conformity, the beliefs that external actors share \ndetermine what ceremony must be performed. these beliefs privilege \ncertain actions over others, ultimately leading the behavior preferred \nby external actors to be perceived as the sole credible action, even if in \ntheory other actions are equally sustainable.20\n official and market sentiments thus create severe policy constraints, \nparticularly when the perceived need for their approval is high. Policies \nthat go against these sentiments will not be judged as credible and will \njeopardize access to external legitimacy and resources. norm entrepre-\nneurs recognize that the beliefs of external actors can be useful assets and \nthus often deliberately ally themselves with these actors to push for re-\nforms. when the perceived need for credibility is high, such as during an \neconomic crisis, domestic norm entrepreneurs whose prescriptions reso-\nnate with the beliefs of relevant external actors will be empowered. in \ndebates with their opponents, these domestic norm entrepreneurs can \nemploy this resonance to present themselves and their policy blueprint \nas the only way to establish credibility and resolve the crisis.\n a second shortcoming of the work on resonance is that it much of \nis overly static and structural and it describes, as amitav acharya ob-\nserves, \u201can existential match\u2026rather than a dynamic process of match-\nmatching.\u201d21 this static view obscures the processes of naming, framing, \nand grafting that are at the very heart of strategic social construction. \nthe static focus on congruence thus misses the dynamic processes of \ncongruence-building that reveal the role of strategic agency and how \nnorm entrepreneurs can overcome barriers to change. instead of treat-\ning norm resonance as simply a static match, i stress a more dynamic \nprocess with emphasis on the strategic agency of norm entrepreneurs.\nindonesia: the guided economy, economic deterioration,  \nand crisis resolution\nin the 1960s most indonesians subscribed to nationalist, statist, and \ncollectivist beliefs, creating a significant obstacle to market reforms.22 \nCapitalism and openness to foreign capital, in particular, were equated \n19 Meyer and rowan 1977.\n20 Kirshner 2003.\n21 acharya 2004, 243.\n22 feith and Castles 1970; Liddle 1988.\n how do crises lead to change? 503\nwith colonialism and exploitation, while support for collectivist forms \nof social organization reinforced this deep suspicion of free markets. \nethnic politics also created obstacles to market reforms. Chinese in-\ndonesians are a minority of the population, and while most are not \nwealthy, some did become enormously rich and as a group owned the \nlargest share of private domestic capital. this generated widespread re-\nsentment among indigenous indonesians (pribumi) and was a key rea-\nson behind the state intervention in the economy that provided them \nwith preferential access to state resources.\n tensions between the two ethnic groups often spilled over into vio-\nlence. as a result, some well-placed Chinese businessmen relied on their \nconnections to develop large conglomerates under military protection. \nin exchange for physical protection, these businessmen enriched their \nmilitary patrons as well as added to their own wealth\u2014often through \nthe formation of joint ventures.\n in the late 1950s, President sukarno launched an intensive drive for \nstate-led industrialization under the rubric of what he called the guided \neconomy. economic considerations were effectively subordinated to the \ngovernment\u2019s political priorities. Many foreign firms were nationalized, \nhad their licenses revoked, or ceased operations. in sectors where foreign \ndirect investment (fdi) could not be avoided, such as the oil sector, the \ngovernment required joint ventures and production-sharing agreements.\n for industrial policy and patronage purposes, the government inter-\nvened extensively in the financial system.23 the central bank\u2019s limited \nautonomy was revoked as the government relied on it to finance un-\nprecedented fiscal deficits. the government also took control over the \nallocation of credit by largely centralizing disbursement in state banks. \nCapital flows were tightly restricted.\n sukarnoist policies resulted in rapid expansion of the money sup-\nply and hyperinflation. following an abortive orthodox stabilization \nprogram in 1963, monetary growth continued largely unabated. reck-\nless fiscal and monetary policies, hyperinflation, and an overvalued ex-\nchange rate produced recurring balance-of-payments crises. By mid-\n1965 the government faced forecasts showing an insufficient amount \nof reserves to cover debt-service costs and import requirements. 24\nconstructing a crisis and the new order\nthe sukarno regime collapsed in late 1965. in the ensuing months, the \narmy, led by suharto, increasingly seized control. the need for change \n23 Macintyre 1993.\n24 Palmer 1978, 7; woo, glassburner, and nasution 1994, 29.\n504 world politics \nwas apparent, but the direction of change was not determined by an \ninexorable structural response.\n of particular importance was norm entrepreneurship from a group \nof western-trained University of indonesia (ui) economists: widjojo \nnitisastro, ali wardhana, Mohammad sadli, emil salim, subroto, \nJohannes B. sumarlin, and radius Prawiro.25 for some time members \nof this group had operated as voices in the wilderness, waiting for an \nopportunity to promote an alternative to sukarnoism. the deteriorat-\ning situation in late 1965 offered the opportunity and they seized it.\n the ui economists, due to their common professional training, \nshared a common diagnosis of the causes of indonesia\u2019s deteriora-\ntion and a belief that market reforms would remedy it. their com-\nmon training, along with personal relationships of trust and friendship, \nhelped to forge the group into a cohesive team. as Prawiro reported, \n\u201cthe esprit de corps among the economic team was exceptional. this \nwas possible because we were all economists with similar training and \nshared a common set of beliefs regarding principles of sound economic \nmanagement. [we] all spoke the same economic language. all of the \nteam members shared very similar assumptions on the economy and \nused the same abbreviated economic jargon.\u201d26 widjojo served as the \nunofficial but acknowledged leader, helping to forge the economists \ninto a cohesive group.27\nthe ui economists believed in neoclassical economics and the capac-\nity of markets to stir growth and efficiency. wielding these beliefs as \nweapons, they implicated sukarnoist policies as producing a dramatic \nfailure in the form of hyperinflation. in their diagnosis, surkarno\u2019s el-\nevation of political priorities over economic considerations had resulted \nin persistent and growing fiscal deficits and unchecked credit expan-\nsion. Bureaucratic expansion, which further strained the budget and \ninvited corruption by giving bureaucrats discretionary control over the \ndistribution of state resources, was also identified as contributing to \nhyperinflation. a new policy-making process was required, widjojo ar-\ngued, one that gave due consideration to prices and material incentives \nand that was insulated from political interference.28\n25 it is not my intention to equate this group of economists with membership in the \u201cBerkeley Ma-\nfia,\u201d though there is a significant degree of overlap. the crucial difference is the inclusion of Prawiro, \nwho did not receive training at Berkeley but did receive some economics training in the west (the \nnetherlands) and was critical in advocating similar ideas as those trained at Berkeley. it is for this \nreason that i opt for the label \u201cui economists\u201d as opposed to \u201cBerkeley Mafia.\u201d\n26 Prawiro 1998, 83. see also salim 1997, 65.\n27 Prawiro 1998, 83; salim 1997, 54, 65; sadli 1993, 41.\n28 Bresnan 1993, 53\u201354.\n how do crises lead to change? 505\nthe ui economists\u2019 blueprint presented orthodox stabilization, open-\nness to foreign capital, and financial assistance from official creditors \nas the only way out of the crisis.29 Liberalizing capital controls, they \nargued, would stir growth and competition. as sadli insisted, \u201cindige-\nnous firms will flourish in such a climate. the existence of foreign firms \nwill have a catalytic effect upon further growth of the national econ-\nomy. the charge frequently heard in ex-colonial economies that foreign \nbusiness stifles the growth of indigenous business will be avoided.\u201d30\nCapital account liberalization stands out among the reforms in the \nui economists\u2019 plan. it did not resonate with the beliefs and interests \nof the pribumi elite and mass public who saw inward fdi as harming \ndomestic firms and distorting development and the removal of restric-\ntions on outflows as undermining capital accumulation. the opposition \nof these actors to liberalization is at odds with expectations derived \nfrom oep models.31 oep models would expect these actors to support \ngreater openness because inward fdi would presumably raise the real \nearnings of local landowners and labor, while the increase in the sup-\nply of finance would presumably lower borrowing costs for owners of \nspecific capital in a capital-scarce country.\nthere are several reasons why this was not the case. to begin with, \noep models overstate the likely support for openness from the tradables \nand nontradables sectors in developing economies. in many develop-\ning economies, capital controls impose higher borrowing costs only \non firms in the nontradables sector because they lack access to foreign \ncurrency revenues to service their debt.32 However, firms in the trad-\nables sector are typically less affected. even if greater openness lowers \nborrowing costs by stirring domestic financial development, the shift \nwould be virtually irrelevant in the tradables sector, especially in econo-\nmies open to trade, since this sector relies less on domestic financing.33 \nthus, contrary to common assumptions in oep models, the tradables \nsector in developing economies may have weak incentives to favor lib-\neralization or will be indifferent to it.\nin some cases, the nontradables sector in developing countries will \nalso be indifferent to liberalization or may have weak incentives to sup-\nport it. in developing economies, most small- and medium-sized do-\nmestic firms in the nontradables sector\u2014such as those owned by many \n29 Bresnan 1993, 54, 58, 60. see also Prawiro 1998: 4\u20137, 22, 32.\n30 as cited in robison 1986, 133, 136.\n31 frieden 1991.\n32 Prati, schindler, and Valenzuela 2009.\n33 Braun and raddatz 2007.\n506 world politics \nof indonesia\u2019s pribumi\u2014do not benefit greatly from any increase in the \nsupply of finance that comes from openness. Historically, private sources \nof finance, especially foreign ones, were reluctant to lend to these firms, \nand the firms therefore found themselves dependent on state banks. \nopenness thus offered these firms little potential benefit\u2014at least in \nthe short to medium term\u2014because few, if any, foreign private credi-\ntors would likely lend to them.34 in addition to material incentives, in a \nnumber of developing economies, as in indonesia, nationalist and stat-\nist beliefs fuelled popular opposition to openness despite any income \neffects that it potentially induced.\noep models also understate likely support for liberalization in many \ndeveloping economies. a number of these models assume that open-\nness harms liquid-asset holders in capital-scarce countries because \nof the lower returns they face on their investments. this assumption \nmisses out on the substantial risks and vulnerabilities that characterize \ninvestment in these developing economies. in the specific case of indo-\nnesia, Chinese businesses saw openness as a hedge against their politi-\ncal vulnerability. openness enabled them to send their assets abroad \nat the first sign of political instability, overriding concerns about the \ndepressed rate of return.35\ntaken together, these considerations created a configuration of inter-\nests within indonesia that bare little resemblance to oep expectations. \nindeed, as Jeffry frieden concedes: \u201cit is worth emphasizing again that \nthese conclusions [derived from oep] abstract from many specifics that \nmay indeed override them\u2026. Clearly, other characteristics [can] out-\nweigh the tendencies discussed here.\u201d36\n the process of destabilizing the sukarnoist status quo was not \nautomatic. sukarno had been forced to yield much authority to the \narmy, but he retained the nominal title of president\u2014a position he \nwould hold until March 1967. He could still count on significant sup-\nport from leftists within the army and segments of the mass public to \nwhom he appealed through revolutionary and anti-western rhetoric \nand a confrontational approach with official creditors. october 1965 to \nMarch 1967 was thus a transition period, with great uncertainty over \nwho would prevail politically.\n34 as noted, some large conglomerates owned by pribumi had developed close connections with \nwell-placed Chinese businessmen, which the conglomerates relied upon for credit in exchange for pro-\nviding physical protection. to the extent that liberalization lowered borrowing costs for these Chinese \nbusinessmen, it would indirectly benefit large and politically influential pribumi conglomerates.\n35 winters 1996. in addition, in many developing economies financial repression lowered the re-\nturns to liquid-asset holders, which provided these actors another incentive to favor openness.\n36 frieden 1991, 440\u201344, fn . 29.\n how do crises lead to change? 507\nin the late 1950s and early 1960s, a number of the ui economists \nhad served as lecturers at the army training school in Bandung where \nthey forged ties with some senior army officials, including suharto.37 \nthis experience gave the ui economists the opportunity to cultivate \namong the army officials an appreciation for how important economic \nconsiderations were for indonesia\u2019s future as well as to introduce those \nofficials to their beliefs about the causes of indonesia\u2019s deterioration. \nwhen the sukarno regime collapsed, the ui economists were thus al-\nready well known and respected by the army as authoritative sources of \ninformation on economic matters. Determined to persuade army of-\nficials to support their arguments, the ui economists convened several \npublic seminars on the state of the economy.\nthe first, known as the new Path seminar because it was the first \ntime that policies of the guided economy were criticized openly, was \nconvened in January 1966. several of the ui economists spoke at it. \nsadli offered the most notable critique of sukarnoism, attacking the \nproblems of inflation, imbalances in price relationships, the size of the \nbureaucracy, declining exports, and the prioritization of political goals \nto the detriment of economic considerations. He argued strongly for \nliberalizing capital controls. \u201cwe must recognize,\u201d he said, \u201cthat we lack \nthe capital to improve the economy and develop the nation. we need \ncapital, yet we cannot raise capital internally. we must look for capital \nfrom abroad.\u201d38\nthe new order under suharto was formed in March 1966. a tri-\numvirate of deputy premiers was created with suharto in charge of \ndefense and security; adam Malik, a prominent nationalist, in charge \nof foreign affairs; and sultan Hamengkubuwono iX, a respected Java-\nnese aristocrat, in charge of economic affairs. with army training and \na limited education, suharto was unschooled in and unsure about eco-\nnomic matters, but he and other actors had to deal with the uncertainty \nthat resulted from destabilization of the precrisis status quo. as actors \nsought new ways to interpret the environment and to remedy the situ-\nation, the ui economists relied on and articulated a set of arguments \nbased on neoclassical models and assumptions. as Prawiro reports, \u201cat \nthe time\u2026nothing was clear. the policies were complex and the crisis \nwas deep. working in an atmosphere of frenzy, the team took a leap of \nfaith that the free market and the power of prudent macroeconomic \npolicy would prevail. in the end, because of the cohesiveness of team \n37 sadli 1993, 39; salim 1997, 56.\n38 as cited in ford foundation 2003, 59. see also sadli 1993, 40.\n508 world politics \nand the essential correctness of their economic positions, the gamble \npaid off.\u201d39\nat the time, however, a number of alternatives presented themselves \nfor selection. Certainly, indonesia\u2019s economic deterioration had revealed \na need for change, but it is implausible to claim that this alone forced \nsuharto to move in the direction he did. alternative models were avail-\nable from regional neighbors, such as Burma and south Korea, where \narmy governments had also recently seized power.\nin Burma, the socialist-leaning army government moved toward \ngreater closure and implemented soviet-style nationalization and cen-\ntral planning. this alternative did not appeal to suharto primarily be-\ncause of his right-wing and pro-american orientation. according to \nsarbini sumawinata, a member of the University of indonesia econom-\nics faculty (but not part of the foreign-trained group advocating market \nreforms) and a key political advisor to suharto, \u201cthe army knew what it \ndid not want, for example, communism, but was less sure about where \nto go from there.\u201d40 they were, as one source notes, \u201cin great need of \nnew and large ideas.\u201d41\nsouth Korea offered an alternative that aligned more closely with \nsuharto\u2019s ideological and geopolitical orientation. indeed, a material-\nist explanation would expect governments with similar ideological and \ngeopolitical orientations and a similar degree of dependence on the \nwest to pursue similar development strategies. But while these mate-\nrial incentives seemingly led south Korea and indonesia down a similar \npath, the ideas embraced by the army in each country pushed them \nin different directions. on one hand, the army regime in south Ko-\nrea chose a set of interventionist policies inspired by Japan and that \nmarginalized the influence of western-trained economists.42 suharto, \non the other hand, moved in the direction of neoliberalism, and the \nui economists secured greater influence (though in the end indonesia \ncombined neoliberalism and interventionism). that indonesia settled \nupon the policy course it did was primarily due to the selection of the \nui economists\u2019 ideas over alternatives, a process that was in turn shaped \nby the four Cs of crisis resolution.\nas actors struggled with uncertainty, the ui economists, as part of \ntheir advocacy, helped craft the new order\u2019s first major statement on \nthe economy, which the sultan delivered in april 1966.43 the state-\n39 Prawiro 1998, 84. see also 26\u201328.\n40 sumawinata 1992, 50.\n41 Bresnan 1993, 52.\n42 Haggard 1990.\n43 Hamengkubuwono iX 1997 [1966].\n how do crises lead to change? 509\nment indicated that indonesia would rejoin the international Mon-\netary fund (imf) and the world Bank, which sukarno had withdrawn \nfrom in 1965, and would approach official creditors to discuss debt re-\nscheduling and new financing. in a further departure from sukarnoism, \nthe statement also revealed that the private sector\u2019s role in the economy \nwould be expanded and foreign capital welcomed.\nHowever, these general public commitments masked the fact that \nprivately the army had yet to make any decisions on specific measures. \nthe ui economists therefore continued to press their views. another \nseminar was convened in May 1966. there subroto unleashed a no-\ntable attack on the guided economy and the ui economists elaborated \ntheir blueprint for action: a new track based on orthodox stabilization, \nopenness to foreign capital, and assistance from official creditors.44\nBy early summer 1966, the direction of change was becoming clearer. \nalthough much of sukarno\u2019s de facto power had been transferred to su-\nharto by virtue of an earlier decree (the supersemar), suharto needed to \nmaintain the appearance of legality so as not to alienate sukarno\u2019s sup-\nporters before consolidating power. the general session of parliament, \nwhich began in late June, furthered suharto\u2019s consolidation of power \nby ratifying the supersemar and commissioning him to form a new \ncabinet. the parliament also supported the ui economists\u2019 blueprint, \napproving a statement the group had drafted\u2014left virtually unchanged \nby suharto\u2014that committed to orthodox stabilization, expansion of \nthe private sector, and greater openness to foreign capital.\na new cabinet was appointed in July and represented a compromise \namong various competing forces. for some observers, the new cabinet \nhad \u201cunmistakenly abandoned the leftist mystique of sukarno\u2019s guided \nDemocracy.\u201d45 Yet for others, most prominently U.s. intelligence op-\neratives, the cabinet choices had \u201ccompromised [the] chances for an \neffective approach to economic problems\u201d in order to appease sukarno \nand his supporters, and indicated that the generals had \u201cno basic inter-\nest in economic affairs.\u201d46\nwhile the new order offered the first sign of its intentions with \nthe sultan\u2019s april statement, many observers at the time were skeptical \nand dismissed the generals as indifferent to and ignorant of economic \nrealities.47 when the cabinet was appointed in July, suharto still had \nnot fully bought into the blueprint of the ui economists, which, due to \nits emphasis on stabilization and liberalization, would adversely affect \n44 Bresnan 1993, 54; Prawiro 1998, 4\u20137, 22, 32; subroto1998, 74.\n45 anderson et al. 1966, 186.\n46 simpson 2008, 218.\n47 elson 2001, 139; simpson 2008, 220.\n510 world politics \nthe army\u2014an organization riddled with corruption and entrenched in \nstate enterprises. as one source notes, the generals \u201cwould need tutor-\ning from the technocrats.\u201d48\nthe crucial turning point occurred in august during a seminar held \nat the army training school in Bandung. it was the first time that most \nof the ui economists met suharto and by all accounts it was when they \nwon him over to their plan. \u201cthat particular seminar,\u201d notes one new \norder cabinet official, \u201cwas the main source, if not the only source, of \ninspiration for the new order\u2026.the new order originated in Band-\nung.\u201d49 indeed, suharto later remarked that the seminar had \u201cformu-\nlated the new order.\u201d50\nat the seminar widjojo, sadli, and salim met with the generals to \nargue in person for their ideas. sarbini was set to argue for an alter-\nnative plan and at the start of the seminar, stood an equal chance of \nwinning over suharto. the great impression he had made on of one of \nsuharto\u2019s advisers had resulted in an invitation to serve as vice chair of \none of the seminar sessions. in addition, his plan was broadly congruent \nwith the beliefs of important members of suharto\u2019s cabinet, including \nMalik and the sultan, as well as with popular sentiment.51 the principal \ndebate took place between widjojo and sarbini. although their diag-\nnoses were quite similar, their blueprints were rather different. sarbini\u2019s \nplan, while recognizing the short-run importance of reducing inflation \nand seeking foreign assistance, was generally inward oriented. He ar-\ngued that over the long run indonesia\u2019s development should come to \nrely more upon domestic than foreign capital. to accomplish this goal, \nthe plan called for a massive program of compulsory domestic saving \nand renewed government assistance to pribumi firms.52\nDespite sarbini\u2019s close links to suharto and the appeal of his blue-\nprint to key cabinet members and popular sentiment, widjojo won the \nargument. He criticized sarbini\u2019s plan for its failure to explain how \ncompulsory domestic saving could produce sufficient investment in a \ncountry suffering from a shortage of capital and reiterated his blueprint \nof orthodox stabilization, liberalization, and assistance from official \ncreditors.\n the success of the ui economists in arguing for their plan under-\nmines the alternative materialist explanation that emphasizes the pri-\nmacy of the logic of consequentialism and distributive preferences. \n48 simpson 2008, 220.\n49 elson 2001, 148.\n50 as cited in elson 2001, 148.\n51 winters 1996, 64.\n52 Liddle 1991, 412.\n how do crises lead to change? 511\nMany pribumi firms and members of the mass public opposed the ui \neconomists\u2019 blueprint because, in their view, it would deepen the reces-\nsion and foster greater foreign dependence. these actors held out hope \nthat expansionary policies could be used to increase productivity.53 But \nwidjojo, in laying out the blueprint, did not bow to these distributive \npreferences and neither did suharto when he selected it.\n at the seminar, suharto engaged in a dialogue with the ui econo-\nmists about their diagnosis and plan. according to sadli, the seminar \npresented \u201cthe army leadership with a \u2018cookbook\u2019 of \u2018recipes\u2019 for deal-\ning with indonesia\u2019s serious economic problems. general suharto as \nthe top army commander not only accepted the cookbook, but also \nwanted the authors of the \u2018recipes\u2019 as his economic advisors.\u201d54\nsoon after the seminar the ui economists were appointed as su-\nharto\u2019s team of experts in the field of economics and finance. the close \nrelationship between suharto and the ui economists would persist until \nthe disintegration of the new order in 1998. During this period the \nui economists took on a number of cabinet posts, beginning with the \nappointment of Prawiro as central bank governor in 1966, followed \nby the appointments of widjojo and salim as chair and deputy chair \nof the national Development Planning agency (Bappenas) in 1967, \nand, in 1968, the appointment of ali wardhana as finance minister. \nover the years, this cohesive team was joined by other foreign-trained \nindonesian economists, many of whom also received their training at \nBerkeley.\nwhy were the arguments of the ui economists selected? Contradict-\ning much of the work on norm resonance, the ui economists\u2019 arguments \ndid not fit well with the beliefs or interests of the vast majority of the \ndomestic actors, particularly pribumi firms and the mass public. How-\never, consistent with the theory developed here, a crucial feature of the \nui economists\u2019 arguments was that they resonated with the beliefs and \ninterests of key external actors with whom the new regime perceived a \nneed to establish credibility. Ultimately, these arguments won out over \nvarious alternatives because of the quality and composition of their car-\nriers, the coalitions they enabled, and the way the arguments fit with \nthe new regime\u2019s perceived need for credibility with external actors.\nthe quality of the ui economists as unrivalled sources of economic \nexpertise was undoubtedly important. Like many military regimes, \nmuch of suharto\u2019s legitimacy depended on delivering development. \nthis legitimating principle, particularly during times of economic de-\n53 Bresnan 1993, 71.\n54 sadli 1993, 40\u201341.\n512 world politics \nterioration, elevated the importance of the ui economists because it \nmeant that suharto, who was uncertain about economic matters, would \nbe predisposed to rely upon them as having the strongest claim to eco-\nnomic expertise. the ui economists\u2019 expertise enabled them to wield \nanalytical tools that could explain indonesia\u2019s inflation, shortage of cap-\nital, low productivity, and recurring balance of payments crises. their \narguments were persuasive in part because, as Peter Hall suggests, they \ncould \u201crelate to the economic and political problems of the day.\u201d55\nthe composition of the group of ui economists and their cohesion, \nin particular, was also important. according to one source, suharto \n\u201cwas deeply impressed with the clarity of their ideas, the unanimity \nwith which they were presented, and their pragmatic sense.\u201d56 the ui \neconomists also discursively framed their arguments, despite their dis-\ntributional implications, as based on objective expertise, not political \nconsiderations. they pursued what one source calls a \u201cstraight econom-\nics\u201d approach, offering their prescriptions as transcending politics and \nformed on the basis of objective and universal criteria while casting the \narguments of their opponents as sectional in nature.57\nthe decision to seek out assistance from external actors meant that \nestablishing credibility with those actors became of utmost importance, \nas it would whenever suharto perceived a need for their support. But \nthis decision was not automatic. Popular nationalist sentiment meant \nthat many indonesians saw external assistance as deepening depen-\ndence. indeed, sukarno\u2019s confrontational approach to external actors, \nepitomized by his nationalist rhetoric telling the west to \u201cgo to hell \nwith your aid\u201d and castigating the new order for its \u201cbegging,\u201d was \naimed at cultivating this sentiment.58\nYet suharto was convinced of the need to gain external assistance. \ntheir command of much needed resources gave these external actors \nand their domestic allies, in this case the ui economists, enormous \nleverage and, more significantly, it meant that these external actors\u2019 \nbeliefs would highly influence the direction of change. During the \nKennedy and Johnson administrations, U.s. officials set out to forge \nclose ties with the ui economists, helping them, for instance, to secure \nprivate foundation study grants in the U.s. and faculty exchanges with \namerican universities. as sukarno\u2019s grip on power gradually slipped \naway, washington made it clear that assistance would be conditional \non stabilization and liberalization. the resonance of the ui economists\u2019 \n55 Hall 1989, 369\u201370.\n56 elson 2001, 149.\n57 azis 1994, 399.\n58 as cited in Hill 2000, 79: \u201cgo to hell with your aid\u201d; and winters 1996, 58: \u201cbegging.\u201d.\n how do crises lead to change? 513\narguments with the beliefs of external actors provided the economists \nwith an important asset to employ in their struggles with their domes-\ntic opponents. in fact, the U.s. embassy in Jakarta consistently sent \nclear signals to army leaders \u201cthat indonesia would not get aid until \nthey went the way the economists advised.\u201d59\nin addition, the imf and the world Bank played an active part in \nstrengthening the impetus for market reforms. they deliberately sup-\nported the ui economists, who shared their policy beliefs but were not \nyet in government, and bypassed those actors within the government \nwho opposed their policy beliefs. in July 1966, with official creditors \nstill withholding support, the imf took the rather unusual step of send-\ning a staff mission to Jakarta even though indonesia would not formally \nrejoin the fund until february 1967. for its part, the world Bank sent \na mission in august 1966 and later took the unprecedented step of \ncreating a permanent mission in 1968. informal discussions between \nthe ui economists, the imf, and the world Bank ensured that the ui \neconomists could come forward with a blueprint that would command \nexternal support. suharto recognized that to access financial resources, \nindonesia needed to commit to policies that resonated with the beliefs \nof external actors regardless of how they fit with domestic beliefs and \ninterests. although official creditors extended some token emergency \naid following the Bandung seminar, they made it clear that new fi-\nnancing and debt rescheduling would not be forthcoming until their \npreferred policies were implemented.\na final crucial factor underpinning the selection of the ui economists\u2019 \narguments was the way they could be used to appeal to the broad coali-\ntion of actors upon whom suharto depended for political survival. su-\nharto faced a dilemma. on one hand, stabilization and liberalization, if \nsuccessful, would foster macroeconomic stability and stir development \nand thus establish credibility with external actors and enhance the re-\ngime\u2019s legitimacy with the mass public. on the other hand, these same \nreforms would adversely affect the army, pribumi firms, and the mass \npublic as well as constrain the use of patron-client networks to main-\ntain political support. also weighing in on this dilemma were suharto\u2019s \nown beliefs, which aligned closely with nationalists in the army and \ngovernment who were united by their rejection of free markets, support \nfor infant industry arguments, and opposition to foreign capital.\n although on the surface there appeared to be no easy way to recon-\ncile this dilemma, in fact, part of the appeal of the ui economists\u2019 blue-\nprint was that there was sufficient scope for suharto to prune it\u2014that \n59 simpson 2008, 219.\n514 world politics \nis, adjust it so that it better fit with his beliefs and interests and those \nof his political supporters.60 suharto realized early on that he could \nreconcile his dilemma by balancing the arguments of the ui economists \nand the nationalists.61 By confining the influence of the ui economists \nto agencies in charge of macroeconomic issues (the finance ministry, \nthe central bank, and Bappenas), and the influence of the national-\nists to agencies responsible for trade and industrial policy, a complex \nmix of liberalization and interventionism could be implemented. su-\nharto also grasped early on that he could rely on profitable state-owned \nfirms\u2014particularly the oil firm Permina (which became Pertamina in \n1968)\u2014to provide an unscrutinized, off-budget source of revenue that \ncould be cordoned off from the control of the ui economists and used \nto build political support.\n sufficiently pruned, the ui economists\u2019 plan clearly fit with suharto\u2019s \nperceived need to foster macroeconomic stability and development, \nestablish credibility with external actors, and secure state resources to \ndistribute to his political supporters. while the ui economists never in-\ntended for their arguments to be pruned in such a manner, they quickly \nrealized that to find common ground with suharto and their oppo-\nnents, some elements of their blueprint would have to put on hold, at \nleast until a new opportunity presented itself. this meant that the ui \neconomists often saw any liberalization, regardless of its sequence, as \nbetter than no liberalization at all.62\nit also explains why their influence was often confined to a narrow \nsubset of issues\u2014the capital account and the financial sector for example \n\u2014such confinement enabled suharto and the nationalists to insulate \nthe real economy from market reforms. Market reforms that threatened \nthe use of state resources for industrial policy and patronage purposes \nhad insufficient crossover appeal to be selected. when backed by the \nui economists, these market reforms may have had quality carriers and \ncohesion, but without crossover appeal or the perceived need for cred-\nibility, they were unlikely to be implemented.\nthe pruning of their arguments and their lack of an independent po-\nlitical base did not mean the ui economists were powerless without the \nsupport of external actors. on the contrary, in addition to the influence \nthey garnered from their expertise and cohesion, the ui economists also \nproved capable of strategically framing and grafting their arguments so \nthat they better fit with suharto\u2019s belief system. while sharing the na-\n60 on pruning, see acharya 2004.\n61 robison 1988; Liddle 1991.\n62 Pincus and ramli 1998.\n how do crises lead to change? 515\ntionalist, collectivist, and statist beliefs of most indonesians, suharto\u2019s \nbelief system was also informed by the specter, and later the memory, of \nhyperinflation and economic deterioration in the 1960s, an experience \nthat he was convinced had to be avoided in the future at all costs.63\nin advocating their ideas, the ui economists understood, as wil-\nliam Liddle suggests, \u201chow to package their explanations and propos-\nals within a nationalist, populist, collectivist, and even anti-imperialist \nrhetorical wrapper, associating themselves with the mainstream goals of \nmodern indonesian culture.\u201d64 rejecting sukarno\u2019s statism and \u201cfree fight \n[unfettered] capitalism,\u201d the ui economists offered their blueprint as \nhelping to create a \u201cPancasila economy,\u201d that is, an economy based on the \nprinciples enshrined in the country\u2019s constitution, especially nationalism \nand social justice.65 these discursive strategies helped the ui economists \npresent themselves not as western stooges seeking to displace wide-\nspread beliefs, but rather as upholders of indigenous beliefs who sought \nto strengthen them without undermining them significantly. this strat-\negy helped further strengthen their clout as carriers of new ideas.\nover the years, the ui economists also routinely exploited suhar-\nto\u2019s fear of hyperinflation and economic deterioration as well as their \nown success and strong track record in staving off indonesia\u2019s collapse. \n\u201cthey were,\u201d as one official close to suharto observes, \u201cvery good at \nscaring the old man [suharto]. they kept him on a razor\u2019s edge, and \nthat\u2019s how they got their way. they told him that if he didn\u2019t follow \ntheir suggestions the people would be without food or clothes, or the \neconomy wouldn\u2019t grow.\u201d66 with their clout and authority effectively \nenhanced by their success in the late 1960s, the ui economists helped \nensure suharto would call upon them again in times of economic dis-\ntress. in addition, widjojo\u2019s deferential communicative style, which \nsuharto preferred in his advisors, was also important. on a number of \ncrucial issues over the years, widjojo employed a combination of Java-\nnese manners and an ability to present complex issues clearly in order \nto bring suharto around to his point of view.67\nstabilizing and liberalizing indonesia\nthe arguments of the ui economists informed how the reform process \nunfolded. in october 1966 an orthodox stabilization program designed \nwith imf assistance was put in place. the program imposed a drastic \n63 elson 2001; Liddle 1991, 409\u201310; woo, glassburner, and nasution 1994, 36, 38.\n64 Liddle 1991, 408.\n65 salim 1997 [1966].\n66 as cited in ford foundation 2003, 51.\n67 Liddle 1991, 408\u2013409.\n516 world politics \nreduction in the fiscal deficit and significant restraints on central bank \ncredit creation. the ui economists also secured passage of additional \nmeasures such as a balanced-budget law, a limit on deficit financing, \nand greater operational autonomy for the central bank, that were aimed \nat limiting what they diagnosed as the key causes of hyperinflation. \nthese measures also fit with their arguments for insulating monetary \nand fiscal policy-making from political interference.\nPolitically, the stabilization program was a huge gamble, as its ad-\nverse effects threatened to undermine suharto\u2019s efforts to consolidate \nhis rule. But the gamble paid off. inflation decelerated from an annual \nrate of over 600 percent in 1966, to about 150 percent in 1967, to only \n4 percent in 1971.68\nalthough in principle the ui economists wanted to create a free \nforeign-exchange market, they recognized that in practice indonesia\u2019s \nsignificant debt burden and shortage of foreign reserves made complete \nfreedom unsustainable in the short run.69 still, in october 1966, the \ngovernment took important first steps in liberalizing foreign-exchange \nmarkets. Later, in May 1967, the creation of foreign-exchange bourses \nmarked a major departure from sukarnoist policies, since it was pos-\nsible, for the first time, to trade foreign currencies against the rupiah \nfreely and legally.\nwith debt rescheduling and significant new financing extended in \nDecember 1966, official creditors sent clear signals that they supported \nthese actions. although orthodox stabilization adversely affected the \narmy, pribumi firms, and the mass public, the success of the ui econo-\nmists in taming inflation, managing the debt burden, and unlocking \nexternal resources bolstered their position against their opponents. the \nenhanced clout provided the ui economists with valuable assets as they \npushed through additional reforms.\nin 1967 restrictions on inward fdi were radically liberalized, including \ngreater freedom to remit profits and dividends and to repatriate capi-\ntal. salim outlined the radical nature of the law: \u201cat this stage all sorts \nof investments are welcome, except in the excluded defense industries. \nthe important thing is not in what sector private investment comes but \nrather when it comes. the time dimension is more important than all \nothers.\u201d70 new banking laws that overturned some of sukarno\u2019s interven-\ntionism were also introduced. restrictions were eased on foreign bank \nentry, though state banks continued to dominate the financial system.\n68 Cole and slade 1996, 16\u201318.\n69 Prawiro 1998, 48.\n70 as cited in winters 1996, 64\u201365.\n how do crises lead to change? 517\nMeasures were also taken to attract foreign and domestic savings \ninto the banking system. residents and nonresidents were permitted \nto attain loans or open accounts denominated in dollars and to convert \nthem into rupiah.71 in september 1968 the government implemented \na significant increase in deposit interest rates offered by state banks.72 \nthese measures attracted large capital inflows into the banking system, \nwhich subsequently generated new concerns about excess liquidity and \nrenewed inflationary pressures. ironically, after years of facing a persis-\ntent shortage of capital, indonesia now found itself facing a \u201ccapital in-\nflows problem.\u201d73 in response, the government temporarily suspended \nthe ability of banks to accept new deposits and over the next three years \nsignificantly lowered the rate on deposits.\n Despite these measures, important selective restrictions remained. \nsome, such as the requirement that state banks and firms secure gov-\nernment approval to borrow abroad, reflected the ui economists\u2019 diag-\nnosis that had raised concerns about debt-service obligations. other \nrestrictions, such as constraints on the operations of foreign banks and \nthe provision of only a limited guarantee of nonnationalization to for-\neign investors, reflected suharto\u2019s efforts to prune the ui economists\u2019 \nblueprint and ensure sufficient crossover appeal while maintaining suf-\nficient credibility with external actors. Market reform and liberalization \nenabled suharto to establish a sufficient amount of external credibility \nwhile selective interventionism enabled him to use the financial system \nfor industrial policy and patronage purposes and to appeal to popular \nhostility toward foreign capital.74\n notwithstanding these restrictions, the economy was clearly moving \ntoward greater openness. Liberalization in early new order indonesia \nculminated with the 1970 decision to abolish restrictions on capital \noutflows. the most prominent materialist explanation for this decision \noffers a crisis-induced model of policy change. Liberalization during \nthe crisis, in this view, was necessary to attract capital, particularly fdi, \nand to send a positive signal to liquid-asset holders, particularly Chi-\nnese businessmen, that they could keep their assets onshore, safe in the \nknowledge that they were free to liquidate their investments.75\nBut those arguments are not fully convincing. there is little doubt \nthat part of the initial impetus for liberalizing restrictions on fdi came \nfrom the perceived need to respond to official and market sentiment. \n71 arndt and suwidjana 1982.\n72 Cole and slade 1996, 17.\n73 on the capital inflows problems, see Calvo, Liederman, and reinhart 1994.\n74 Macintyre 1993; Palmer 1978, 101\u2013103, 157\u201358; winters 1996, 65\u201366, 70\u201371.\n75 Haggard and Maxfield 1996.\n518 world politics \nthere is little evidence, however, to support the claim that the crisis \nalone was responsible for the radical opening to fdi. More significantly, \nas discussed above, the decision to seek out financing from external \nsources was not automatic; on the contrary, it resulted from the ef-\nforts of the ui economists and western creditors to convince suharto \nthat their diagnosis and blueprint were the only way out. in fact, even \nproponents of crisis-induced models of policy change make ad hoc \nconcessions that stress such social processes. as stephan Haggard and \nsylvia Maxfield claim, \u201cthe proximate causal mechanism is politicians\u2019 \nperception that liberalization of the capital account will assure investors \nand thus ultimately induce capital inflows.\u201d such perceptions do not \nfloat freely. in fact, at the time the decision was made the conventional \nwisdom was that governments should tighten capital controls during \na crisis. that an alternative perception was inserted into the policy-\nmaking process was largely due to the mechanisms identified in the \ntheory developed here.\nindeed, it is doubtful that radical liberalization of fdi was the only \nway out. indonesia could have pursued an alternative development \nmodel such as one that relied on a selective opening to foreign capi-\ntal, which arguably could have produced similar results. in fact, despite \nthe radical opening, fdi never loomed large as a proportion of gross \ndomestic product or gross capital formation.76 nevertheless, the gov-\nernment perceived radical liberalization as necessary. it should also be \nnoted that while the fdi law grew out of a perceived need to attract \nforeign capital, its precise form was not simply a response to the official \nand market sentiment. it also reflected the ui economists\u2019 arguments \nagainst a selective opening, which they viewed as depressing growth \nand stifling the catalytic effect on domestic firms.77\nin addition, there is not sufficient support for the claim that controls \non outflows were abolished solely to attract capital. although part of \nthe initial impetus for liberalization in the late 1960s came from a per-\nceived need to attract capital, by the 1970s the economy was no longer \nin dire straits. stabilization had given way to recovery while improved \nexport performance and strong capital inflows into the banking system \nenabled the government to replenish its foreign reserves.78 it is there-\nfore doubtful that the decision to abolish controls on outflows origi-\nnated from some material need to attract capital to an economy that \nwas already showing signs of a capital inflows problem.\n76 Hill 2000, 77\u201379.\n77 Palmer 1978, 18.\n78 woo, glassburner, and nasution 1994, 185.\n how do crises lead to change? 519\nthere is also much evidence undermining the claim that liberaliza-\ntion was simply an exercise in signalling. if the government was seek-\ning to send unambiguously positive signals to owners of capital, it was \nnot doing a particular good job. in 1968 and 1970, the government, \ndue to strong objections from pribumi firms, refined the 1967 radi-\ncal liberalization of fdi by excluding additional sectors from foreign \nparticipation.79 in addition to these measures, the limited guarantee \nof nonnationalization also caused discomfort among foreign owners of \ncapital.80 regarding the decision to abolish controls on outflows, with-\nout accompanying institutional reforms such as delegating authority \nfor capital account policy to an independent central bank, it is unlikely \nthe decision would have been interpreted by foreign or domestic own-\ners of capital as a strong signal because liberalization could be easily \nreversed in the future.\nthere is, however, stronger support for the claim that the decision to \nabolish controls on outflows grew out of a perceived need to maintain \nthe confidence of liquid-asset holders, particularly Chinese business-\nmen. indeed, it is often said that this policy was part of an implicit \ncontract between suharto and the military on the one hand, and their \npolitical supporters among Chinese businessmen on the other. while \nliberalization clearly fits with the interest of Chinese businessmen in \nhedging against their political vulnerability, if capital controls were an \nineffective policy instrument, then there is a risk in overstating the in-\ntensity of this interest.\nindeed, some scholars who claim liberalization was part of an im-\nplicit contract between suhuarto and Chinese businessmen also argue \nthat controls on outflows were abolished because they were ineffec-\ntive.81 this presents an inconsistency. one can explain the decision as \nan effort to appeal to the interests of Chinese businessmen in hedg-\ning their political vulnerability. or one can attribute it to the fact that \nthe controls were easily evaded. But it is inconsistent to claim that the \ncontrols were liberalized because they prevented Chinese businessmen \nfrom liquidating their assets and because they were ineffective.\nthis is not to deny that the idea to abolish controls on outflows \nwas bolstered by its appeal to liquid-asset holders and other owners \nof capital. even if controls could be easily evaded, liquid-asset hold-\ners might have seen liberalization as part of an implicit contract with \n79 robison 1986, 146.\n80 winters 1996, 65\u201366, 70\u201371.\n81 see, for instance, Macintyre 1993, 140, who identifies \u201cdual motives involved in the move\u201d to \ncapital account openness.\n520 world politics \nthe regime that it took their interests seriously. in fact, as the theory \ndeveloped here claims, ideas often win out because they serve as im-\nportant coalition-building resources. Yet the above discussion suggests \nthat liquid-asset holders may not have been held a very intense interest \nin liberalization.\nthere is also much evidence to support the view that much of the \nimpetus for abolishing the controls came from the ui economists. while \nmany scholars allude to the role of the ui economists, few devote seri-\nous attention to how their arguments and strategic actions helped to \novercome resistance to it. the ui economists viewed abolishing controls \nas consistent with their belief in free markets and as a continuation of \nearlier steps taken to liberalize the foreign-exchange market. More sig-\nnificantly, they believed that liberalization would constrain the ability \nof politicians to make inflationary monetary and fiscal policy choices. \nHowever, nationalists and their business allies strongly opposed this \nposition because it would deprive them of their preferential access to \nforeign exchange.82 Bureaucrats within the foreign exchange transac-\ntion Board (fetb) also were opposed, as it stood to eliminate one of \ntheir major activities.\n as part of the 1970 policy decision, the exchange rate was unified \nwith support from the imf. Prawiro had favored exchange rate unifica-\ntion but concerns about the degree of discipline that capital account \nopenness would impose on a fixed exchange rate regime led him to \nrecommend a flexible rate that could be adjusted to changing market \nconditions.83 But other ui economists argued for a fixed rate on the ba-\nsis that it would stir exports and act as constraint on inflationary policy \nchoices.84\n on the issue of abolishing controls on outflows, the ui economists \nwere in complete agreement. Controls, in their view, imposed signifi-\ncant administrative costs, created severe distortions, and bred corrup-\ntion.85 the ui economists also pointed to the failure of sukarnoist con-\ntrols to prevent capital flight as a clear demonstration of the difficulties \nof effectively controlling capital.86\n wardhana and widjojo first worked to forge an internal compro-\nmise among the ui economists on the exchange rate regime and sought \na way to mute some opposition to liberalization. in discussions among \nthe ui economists, Prawiro, in seeking to lessen opposition from fetb \n82 Cole and slade 1996, 330; salim 1997 72.\n83 Prawiro 1998, 310, fn. 5.\n84 Cole and slade 1996, 44\u201345.\n85 salim 1997, 72; Djojohadikusumo 1986, 38\u201339.\n86 Hill 2000, 42, 66; Prawiro 1998, 290\u201391.\n how do crises lead to change? 521\nbureaucrats, suggested abolishing the bureaucracy and transferring the \nemployees to the central bank at commensurate rank and salary and \nmore favorable long-term prospects.87 wardhana and widjojo backed \nthis proposal while securing support for a fixed exchange rate regime. \nwidjojo and salim then went to suharto to convince him of the need \nto liberalize. their arguments proved more influential than those of \ntheir opponents. suharto, in a cabinet meeting, supported the proposal \nof the ui economists despite hearing many objections.\n the decision was never reversed. notwithstanding its potential ap-\npeal to liquid-asset holders, it is remarkable that the ui economists were \nable to implement this policy given their lack of an independent politi-\ncal base, opposition from nationalists, and popular hostility. Moreover, \nexternal actors such as the imf, though supporting exchange rate uni-\nfication, did not add much support. in addition, economic conditions \nat the time provided little urgent need to liberalize further to appease \nmarket (or official) sentiment.\n However, the quality of the ui economists as ideational carriers \nproved to be an asset. Having achieved earlier success, they were in a \nstronger position to push for further reforms. equally important were \nthe strategic actions they took to mute opposition and win over su-\nharto. in addition to Prawiro\u2019s proposal to transfer fetb bureaucrats to \nthe central bank, another important discursive strategy the ui econo-\nmists employed was to focus on the corruption associated with capital \ncontrols.\n By 1970, popular sentiment had begun to turn against elements of \nthe new order due to allegations of increasing authoritarianism, cor-\nruption, and government excesses, such as Pertamina\u2019s growing off-\nbudget borrowing and distribution of funds.88 Pertamina\u2019s activities \nalso alarmed the ui economists, who thought the economy was still \ntoo weak to service nonconcessional debt. Because large debt-service \npayments would place a strain on foreign reserves, the ui economists \nbelieved that Pertamina\u2019s activities could jeopardize their commitment \nto capital account openness.89\n suharto had shrewdly positioned himself so as to not be implicated \nin Pertamina\u2019s activities, yet he had full knowledge of and benefitted \nfrom them all the while. nonetheless, he proved sensitive to allega-\ntions of corruption, and in 1970 authorized a sweeping investigation of \npractices within the new order, including those of Pertamina. though \n87 Cole and slade 1996, 349, fn. 44.\n88 robison 1986, 160, 235.\n89 winters 1996, 88.\n522 world politics \nsuharto permitted Pertamina\u2019s activities to continue until its near de-\nfault in 1975, the decision to authorize the investigation represented \na partial victory for the ui economists. it suggests that the economists \nwere able to alert suharto to the fact that whatever benefits he was \ngarnering from Pertamina\u2019s activities, he was simultaneously jeopardiz-\ning economic and political stability by undermining the confidence of \nexternal actors in government policies and in the ability of the ui econ-\nomists to direct them. By linking capital controls to corruption, the \nui economists helped ensure their arguments for liberalization would \nresonate with suharto\u2019s concerns about limiting, or at least appearing \nto limit, corruption.\n the ui economists also strategically kept suharto and the national-\nists in the dark about the policy implications of maintaining an open \ncapital account and a fixed exchange rate. By 1970 popular sentiment \nhad turned against fiscal and monetary restraint and there was a strong \npossibility that future easing would be necessary to accommodate po-\nlitical demands. Yet capital account openness, along with the balanced-\nbudget law, offered ways to constrain these demands.\n the ui economists recognized the extraordinary discipline that \nopenness would impose on fiscal and monetary policy. But they chose \nnot to share this knowledge with suharto or opponents who lacked \ntheir sophisticated understanding of open-economy macroeconomics. \nindeed, most government officials did not fully appreciate the mag-\nnitude of the decision at the time.90 thus, by strategically shrouding \ntheir opponents in a veil of ignorance, the ui economists helped win \nacceptance of outflow liberalization.\nconclusion\nthis article shows the limitations of rationalist depictions of crises. in \nindonesia, the new order\u2019s embrace of market reforms was not auto-\nmatic and newly dominant political coalitions did not play a decisive \nrole at each stage of the process. the indonesian case shows that oep \nmodels, despite their elegance, are often too sparse and too far removed \nfrom specific national circumstances to provide a useful guide to un-\nderstanding crisis politics. Moreover, distributive preferences were not \na prominent guide to action at all stages of the crisis resolution process. \neven when distributive preferences did assert themselves, such as in \nthe debate over the october 1966 stabilization program, key support-\n90 Cole and slade 1996, 43, 329\u201330; Hill 2000, 42, 66; Macintyre 1993, 140; Prawiro 1998, 291.\n how do crises lead to change? 523\ners of suharto often found themselves on the losing side of the argu-\nment. this is not to deny the impact of distributive preferences. in-\ndeed, the crossover appeal, in both a distributive and ideational sense, \nwas argued and found to be important. Yet much oep work on crises \noverestimates the importance of bargaining and negotiation as mecha-\nnisms of change while giving insufficient attention to uncertainty and \nthe intensity to which distributive preferences are held. in underesti-\nmating the role of persuasion, oep work also obscures the influence \nof intersubjective beliefs on actors\u2019 interpretations of material events \nand incentives.\nConstructivists, while stressing the role of belief systems, uncertainty, \nand persuasion, do not adequately theorize the scope conditions under \nwhich a new idea is likely to be selected. this article seeks to rectify \nthis shortcoming by identifying the four Cs of crisis resolution: carriers, \ncomposition, crossover appeal, and credibility. it also strengthens extant \nconstructivist work on resonance by considering a broader range of ac-\ntors that shape intersubjective change and by developing a more agent-\ncentered and strategic approach. overall, the indonesian case supports \nthe contention that whenever a prominent and cohesive group of carri-\ners advocates arguments with sufficient crossover appeal and externally \nsanctioned credibility, intersubjective change is more likely.\nHow can these arguments be extended? a research agenda that \nopens up the black box of the crisis resolution process could prove a \nuseful starting point. an obvious first place to turn is the global finan-\ncial crisis of 2007\u201309. Despite efforts to coordinate policies, this highly \nvisible and intense crisis has nonetheless produced interesting policy \ndivergence. this divergence provides researchers with a rich area for \nfuture empirical inquiry.\nin pursuing this research agenda it is worth considering how well the \narguments developed here apply to other issue areas and institutional \nsettings. for instance, it could be the case that political mobilization \nwas muted in the indonesian case because capital account liberaliza-\ntion is a relatively technical area where the costs for the mass public \nare widely distributed, uncertain, and (when they appear) often very \ndelayed. in such issue areas it may prove easier for norm entrepreneurs \nto obtain insulation from the mass public than in those areas where \nthe costs are concentrated, clear, and immediate (i.e., fiscal subsidies \nfor food or oil). it may also be the case that policy choices in relatively \ntechnical areas are more likely to depend on credibility with external \nactors than legitimacy with domestic ones. notwithstanding these con-\nsiderations, it should be noted that in the case of indonesia, the mass \n524 world politics \npublic and members of the elite did have relatively clear and intense \npreferences about openness to foreign capital even if they did not fully \ngrasp its implications.\nin terms of institutional settings, it is worth considering whether the \nperceived need to establish credibility with external actors rather than \nlegitimacy with domestic elites and the mass public is particularly in-\ntense in authoritarian settings. while the indonesian case reveals that \nmass public demands can shape policy even in an authoritarian setting, \ndemocracy can often be at odds with market reform. it is therefore \nimportant to investigate whether the crisis-resolution process specified \nhere also pertains to democratic institutional settings.\nthere are also strong links between the arguments made here and \nother ongoing debates. first, understanding the role of credibility in \ncrisis resolution may provide additional insights into how legitimacy \ngaps open up for external actors, such as the imf, and potentially un-\ndermine their efficiency.91 in addition, understanding the role of reso-\nnance between the beliefs of domestic norm entrepreneurs and those \nof powerful external actors may provide insight into how the attributes \nof countries where international organizations operate influence their \nbehavior, including their willingness to support countries where sym-\npathetic interlocutors are present.92\n finally, a broader implication of the focus on credibility is that \nscholars need to be more attentive to the beliefs shared by external \nactors. it is insufficient for credibility-based explanations to simply as-\nsume that external actors share particular beliefs. Because the beliefs of \nthese actors affect the type of incentives they exert for action, we need \nto be more sensitive to these beliefs to strengthen our explanations. \nthis calls for a research agenda that explores more deeply the beliefs \nof official creditors, international organizations, financial-market par-\nticipants, and regulatory and standard-setting bodies. research into \nthe common knowledge that informs the behavior of these actors and \nthose that interact with them offers a genuine opportunity for synthe-\nsis between rationalism and constructivism.93\n91 seabrooke 2007.\n92 woods 2006.\n93 Katzenstein, Keohane, and Krasner 1998.\n how do crises lead to change? 525\nreferences\nacharya, amitav. 2004. \u201cHow ideas spread: whose norms Matter? norm Lo-\ncalization and institutional Change in asian regionalism.\u201d International Or-\nganization 58, no. 1: 239\u201375.\nanderson, Benedict r. o\u2019g., frederick P.
