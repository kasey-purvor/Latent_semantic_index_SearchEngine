INTRODUCTION\nTRADITIONALLY a two-pan heat-flux differential\nscanning calorimeter (DSC) is used to measure thermal prop-\nerties as a function of temperature.[1\u20135] Problems arise when\nlatent heat is evolved. The heat appears to be evolving over\na range of temperatures.[6,7,8] In this article, the reason for\nthis smearing of the latent heat is briefly discussed, and a\nnovel single-pan calorimeter is described that eliminates\nsmearing. Experiments are reported that investigate the re-\nproducibility and sensitivity in the new calorimeter.\nThe new calorimeter has been used to investigate mi-\ncrosegregation in an Al-Cu alloy, and the results are com-\npared with Alloy\/M,[9] a microsegregation model that is linked\nwith the thermodynamic database package MTDATA.[10]\nII. PROBLEMS WITH A TWO-PAN HEAT-\nFLUX DSC\nA schematic diagram of a two-pan heat-flux DSC is shown\nin Figure 1. In use, the temperature of the surroundings is\nscanned at a constant rate, and the temperature difference\nbetween the reference and the sample thermocouples is used\nto calculate the difference in heat capacity between the ref-\nerence and the sample. Problems arise when latent heat is\nevolved or absorbed. These are illustrated in Figure 2. The\nfigure shows the temperature of the surroundings, TF, the\ntemperature of the sample pan thermocouple, TSP, the tem-\nperature of the reference pan thermocouple, TRP, and the\ntemperature of the sample, TS, plotted against time. When\na pure metal sample melts, its temperature stays constant,\nand the heat flux increases. The increased heat flux leads\nto a larger temperature difference between the sample and\nthe external sample thermocouple. After the sample has\nmelted, the sample temperature returns to the steady state\nvalue. It is usual to assume that the difference in heat capacity\nbetween the sample and reference thermocouples is propor-\ntional to the temperature difference between the sample and\nreference. The temperature difference is plotted as a function\nof the sample thermocouple temperature in Figure 2(b). It\nis clear from this diagram that the latent heat appears to be\nevolving over a range of temperatures. Although corrections\ncan be made,[7] they are difficult to carry out because the\nvarious heat transfer coefficients are not completely repro-\nducible. To reduce this smearing of latent heat, calorimeter\nmanufacturers usually recommend using very small samples\n(\u00021 mg); but even with this small size, the latent heat\ntypically appears to be smeared over about 3 K in a pure\nmaterial. Further, the very small sample size leads to a lack\nof resolution and sensitivity. These criticisms apply equally\nwell to differential thermal analysis (DTA). The DTA is very\nsimilar to a heat-flux DSC,[11] but the emphasis is put on\nthe detection of phase transitions rather than on the measure-\nment of enthalpy.\nIII. SINGLE-PAN CALORIMETER\nA single-pan calorimeter has been developed that elimi-\nnates smearing. The essential feature of the new calorimeter\nis that the sample is in a uniform temperature enclosure,\nand it has the largest possible thermal resistance between\nthe sample and its surroundings. A schematic diagram of\nthe apparatus is shown in Figure 3. To ensure a uniform\ntemperature enclosure, the outer crucible is thermally iso-\nlated from the furnace, is thick walled, and made of a mate-\nrial with a high conductivity. The inner crucible is thermally\nisolated from the outer crucible to ensure the maximum\ntemperature difference between the two crucibles. The sam-\nple is made large enough so that the sample thermocouple\ncan be placed inside the specimen. In principle, there is no\ndisadvantage in using large samples, provided significant\nH.B.

This means that the\ntemperature rises less rapidly when latent heat is absorbed\nor evolved.\nIV. ENTHALPY CALCULATION\nBecause of the simplicity of the single-pan calorimeter,\nequations are easily derived to relate temperature changes\nto enthalpy changes. As in a conventional DSC, a run is\ncarried out with an empty pan, the empty pan \u0001 calibrant,\nand the empty pan \u0001 sample. The temperature differences\nare first corrected with a zero line adjustment. These are\nmeasured during an isothermal anneal[8,12] at a number of\ndifferent temperatures.\nAs the calorimeter is heated in the time interval, dt, the\ntemperature of the empty inner crucible rises by dTE , theFig. 2\u2014(a) The temperature of the furnace (TF), reference pan thermocouple\ncalibrant \u0001 empty rises by dTC , and the sample \u0001 empty(TRP), sample pan thermocouple (TSP), and sample (TS) for melting a pure\nmetal in a conventional two-pan DSC.

This is not the case for Al-Cu, as is shown in\nFigure 10. This shows the enthalpy of liquid Al (i.e., an Al-plot of enthalpy vs temperature by extrapolating the liquid\nand solid lines, as plotted schematically in Figure 8, and Cu liquid solution), solid Al (i.e., an Al-Cu solid solution),\nand solid CuAl2 at the eutectic temperature calculated usingthen by taking the ratio (Eq. [3]) from the figure. Figure 8\nis slightly more complicated than suggested by Eq. [2], since MTDATA. The compositions of the different phases at the\neutectic temperature are shown by the points.the heat capacity of the solid and liquid are shown to be\ndifferent, but this makes little difference to the principle of Further complications arise. The extreme form of micro-\nsegregation occurs when the liquid is mixed, but the solidthe calculation.\nThe problem with this approach is apparent when it is remains unmixed. The fraction solid can be calculated from\nthe Scheil equation.[18] The enthalpies of one mol of liquid,asked: \u201cDoes Figure 8 refer to mass, mol, or volume frac-\ntion?\u201d The fraction will in general be different for the three solid, and the phase mixtures are shown in Figure 11. These\nwere calculated assuming the Scheil equation usingdifferent units. The problem is resolved by noting that the\nliquid and solid enthalpies should not be extrapolated from MTDATA.[10] The step in the mixture plot arises because\nof microsegregation. Some liquid remains at the eutecticthe completely solid and liquid regions. These represent\nliquid and solid enthalpies when the composition of the temperature. The two sets of curves are plotted together in\nFigure 12. The liquid lines superimpose because the liquidphases remains unchanged.

Figure 9 shows the enthalpy per mol of each phase\nand that of the mixture calculated at equilibrium using is because the average solid compositions are different in\nthe two cases.

The composition of different parts of\nthe solid and the liquid can be used to calculate the enthalpy,\nwhich can then be compared with the experiment.
