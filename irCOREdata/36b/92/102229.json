In order to improve performance, a wide \nrange of techniques have been utilised for a fundamental scientific understanding of the \ncomponents and processes and also to investigate MFC performance bottlenecks. This \ntutorial article reviews the electrochemical\/electroanalytical techniques employed in \nrecent MFC studies and discusses the principles, experimental implementation, data \nprocessing requirements, capabilities, and weaknesses of these techniques.  \n 2\n1. Introduction \nMicrobial fuel cells (MFCs) and enzymatic fuel cells (EFCs) are the two principal types \nof biological fuel cells (also called biofuel cells);1,2 these are devices that transform \nchemical energy into electrical energy via electrochemical reactions involving microbes \nor enzymes either located in both anode and cathode compartments or in just one \ncompartment; enzyme (protein) containing electrodes can also be employed in MFCs, \nthereby resulting in a hybrid of EFCs and MFCs.  \nMFCs generally consist of an anode, a cathode, an electrolyte (which can be in \nmembrane form) and an electrical circuit; microbes located in one (or more) of the \ncompartments are used to degrade\/convert organic and\/or inorganic substrates via their \nmetabolisms. Electrons are produced at the anode and transferred through an external \ncircuit to the cathode, whilst a charge balancing number of cations and\/or anions are \ntransferred between anode and cathode.  \nUtilising microbes or enzymes for electricity generation extends the range of fuels \n(substrates) that can be oxidised or oxidants that can be reduced; hence biological fuel \ncells can carry out specific tasks, and\/or have niche applications, in addition to power \ngeneration. Two key issues that are required for a sustainable society are environmental \nprotection and the generation of clean energy. MFCs are attracting worldwide attention, \ndriven by the promise of clean and renewable energy from various wastes and \nwastewaters. Currently, MFCs can only produce low power outputs (< 6 W m\u20132; \u2264 500 W \nm\u20133)3 due to many factors related to the anode, the cathode, the chemical species present \nin the electrolyte, the ion\u2013exchange or filtration membrane (if used), the microbial \nspecies present and their metabolisms, fuel cell configuration, and operational conditions. \n 3\nScaling up of these devices can be problematic, since what are considered as \u2018acceptable \nlosses\u2019 at lab scale, become parasitic when scaled up to demonstration or commercial \nproducts.  \nA better understanding of all of the components is required, to allow the bottlenecks in \nMFC to be identified and to improve power outputs; the selection of the most appropriate \ntechniques for MFC diagnosis and evaluation is vital in achieving this. To fully \nunderstand MFCs, knowledge of multiple technological disciplines is required, such as \nelectrochemistry, microbiology, materials science and engineering, molecular biology \nand environmental engineering. It is a challenge for any research team to completely \nunderstand all of the theories and techniques used in the study of MFCs. An example is \nthat some of the \u201celectrochemistry\u201d employed and\/or described in some research papers \ncan be described as ambiguous and\/or inappropriate. In recent years a series of detailed \nreview papers have discussed the MFC history, construction, reaction mechanisms, \noperational conditions and limitations.2-9 However, review of the most appropriate \nelectrochemical techniques required for MFC diagnosis has not been given the \nappropriate level of attention, with only a few such techniques being discussed.10  \nNew mechanisms (microbial physiological, chemical and electron transport) are being \ngradually elucidated. Electrochemical\/analytical techniques have an essential role in this \ncontinuing process; they are vitally important in analysing the limiting performances of \neach component, to optimise MFC operation, and to allow continued innovation. In this \narticle, we review, from both electrochemistry and fuel cell materials chemistry \nperspectives, the techniques that are useful for the study and development of MFCs; the \n 4\naim is to complement previously published reviews, to highlight some of the capabilities \nand to expose weaknesses of these techniques.  \n \n2. Basic considerations \nGenerally speaking, the electrochemical techniques now being more routinely used in \nMFC studies have been used in the study of traditional electrochemical systems (e.g. \nchemical fuel cells and electrocatalytic systems) for many decades. The biological \nprocesses involved in electron transfer reactions in MFCs are more complex when \ncompared with classical electrochemical systems that are, by comparison, relatively \nsimple and clean. The main difference between chemical fuel cells [such as a \nhydrogen\/oxygen (air) polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC)] and MFCs is that the \nelectricity generation in MFCs arises from the metabolic activity of microbes; the \ncontinuous and long term operation of MFCs mandates that systems must be run under \nconditions that are generally predefined by the requirements for optimal microbial growth \nand sustainability. Typical conditions include ambient temperatures and pressures, \nelectrolytes with a low concentration of ions, and near neutral pH. \nMaximum current densities of MFCs are typically < 3 mA cm\u20132; these levels are \nsignificantly lower than those of PEFCs, which are of the order of > 1 A cm\u20132 (both \nnormalised to geometrical electrode area). The performances and requirements of the \nelectrode materials and catalysts in MFCs and chemical fuel cells differ substantially, \neven for the same reaction. One example is the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)11-14 \nwhere anions such as Cl\u2013, HSO4\u2013, HPO42\u2013, and HS\u2013 are well known to be species that \npoison Pt catalysts and seriously interfere with the electrode reactions on Pt catalytic \n 5\nsurfaces; however, the majority of MFC and related studies involve the presence of \nphosphate buffers, ionic strength adjusters (e.g. NaCl) and other nutrients. The low O2 \ndissolution concentrations in electrolyte and the low H+ concentration (\u2248 10-7 mol dm-3) \nhave a significant impact on the cathode ORR performance in a MFC operating at \nambient temperature. It is essential that the nature of all the species (including spectator \nions and microbes) are taken into account, especially when they can come into contact \nwith the catalysts. This could be one explanation why non-Pt ORR catalysts show similar \nperformance levels with MFCs containing platinum. MFC components (electrodes, \ncatalysts, membrane etc.) must be tolerant to these species for long term operation. \nThe following sections briefly introduce MFCs from an electrochemical point of view, \nbefore discussing the suitability of the various techniques that can be used in studying \nthese complicated systems.  \n \n2.1 Choice of electrode configurations \nTwo\u2013 and three\u2013 electrode configurations are commonly employed to determine MFC \nand electrode performances; a four\u2013electrode configuration is sometimes used when the \nconductivity of an electrolyte (membrane) or electrode material is tested by \nelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).  \nIn practice, a MFC only needs two electrodes for electricity generation, an anode and a \ncathode. A variety of materials have been used as electrodes: graphite foil, rods, granules, \nand fibre brush; carbon paper, cloth, felt, and foam; activated carbon cloth; reticulated \nvitreous carbon; electrodes modified with conductive polymers; and metals such as \naluminium, nickel or stainless steel. The choice of materials used for the anode or \n 6\ncathode generally depends upon the electrical potential window required. It is sometimes \noverlooked that the electrode materials and substances in the electrolyte are not \nelectrochemically inert and may themselves generate currents in a potential range of the \nexperiment in question. For example: (1) metal electrodes will generate currents due to \nchemical and\/or microbial corrosion or passivation; (2) carbon materials will most likely \nnot have pristine surfaces composed of 100% elemental carbon and will have heteroatom-\ncontaining surface groups such as quinones, amines, carboxylic acids, or other nitrogen \ncontaining functionalities, some of which can be electrocatalytically active; (3) \nelectroactive binders are sometimes added for reasons of ease of electrode manufacture; \n(4) unwanted electroactive species (contaminants) are easily absorbed on the surface of \nelectrodes prior to experiment and can also generate currents; (5) Pt electrodes will cause \nbackground currents by electrochemically oxidising a variety of substrate materials that \nmay be present in MFCs e.g. sucrose or acetate; (6) electroactive chemicals exist \nnaturally in various wastewaters. The background currents from the electrode materials \nand eletroactive chemicals present in the MFC should be evaluated in the absence of \nmicrobial species if meaningful results are to be collected. Those background\/control \nexperiments are necessary for the complete understanding of a system\u2019s electrochemistry, \nespecially for complex devices such as MFCs. \nThe measurement of a cathode\u2013anode two electrode configuration represents the \noverall MFC performance, which will be limited by many factors and is rarely \ncompletely reproducible due to changes in the growth, evolution, and metabolism of the \nconsortium of microbes present. In order to avoid unwanted perturbations to the system \nand to simplify studies, a reference electrode (RE) and a counter electrode (CE, \n 7\nsometimes called an auxiliary electrode) are often introduced into a MFC in order to \nanalyse the behaviour of an individual working electrode (WE), which can either be the \nanode or cathode: this is then a three\u2013electrode configuration. The potential of or the \ncurrent generated at the WE can be precisely controlled in a three\u2013electrode mode (this is \nnot always possible with a two\u2013electrode configuration). \nThe type of RE used must be clearly reported as the potential difference between \npractical REs of different types and the standard hydrogen electrode differs; care is \nrequired when a RE is employed over long periods of time as there will inevitably be \nsmall potential changes e.g. from concentration changes inside the RE. Due to the fact \nthat silver\/silver chloride (Ag\/AgCl) and saturated calomel electrodes (SCE) are cheap, \npractical, and easily prepared, and in addition have the ability to be \u2018revived\u2019 after long \nterm operation, they are commonly the preferred option for REs. \nElectrically conductive (e\u2013) and high surface area materials, such as Pt web or graphite \nfoil, are usually employed as the CE, in order to prevent CE derived mass transport and \nactivity limitations interfering with the measurement of the performance at the WE. The \nrequirement of the CE is that it does not produce byproducts or contamination that would \ncause interferences to the anode or cathode reactions being studied (the tiniest trace of Pt \non a WE can increase its activity towards a variety of species); it can, if required, be \nseparated from the chamber\/compartment by a glass frit or sinter to minimize CE\u2013derived \ncontamination.  \n \n 8\n2.2 Electrode reaction mechanisms and processes \nDifferent catalysts for, and mechanisms of, MFC electrode reactions have been proposed. \nFor the cathode,9 catalysts such as carbon\u2013supported platinum, metal \ntetramethyphenylporphyrins and metal phthalocyanine have been used for the ORR. As \nwell as oxygen in air, electron accepting chemicals such as ferricyanide or MnIV species \ncan be used. Biocathodes have also been reported.15 For the anode, direct electron \ntransfer (DET) from the microbes to the typically carbon\u2013based anode via extracellular \ncytochromes16 or conductive microbial pili (electrically conductive nanowires) have been \nobserved.17 Indirect (mediated) electron transfer (IET) to the anode is also possible via \nelectroactive metabolites, such as hydrogen or sulphide,18,19 or with the addition of non-\nnatural (chemical) redox mediators. \nFor abiotic cathodes immersed in electrolyte solutions, the electrode reactions of MFCs \nare heterogeneous and take place in the interfacial region between the solid electrode and \nthe solution. An example of a pathway for a simple oxidation or reduction process \n( RneO \u2194+ \u2212 , where O is the oxidised species and R is the corresponding reduced form) \non an electrode is given in Fig. 1. The distribution of charged species, which affects the \nelectrode processes, differs in the electrode surface region and in the bulk solution and \ncan take place in multiple stages as summarised below:20 \n1. Mass transport of the O\u2033 species to the electrode surface where the reaction \n( RneO \u2194+ \u2212 ) occurs; \n2. On the electrode surface, chemical reactions that might not involve an electron \ntransfer processes [e.g. adsorption, desorption, protonation, decomposition, \n 9\nelectrodeposition steps ( '\" OO \u2194  and '\" RR \u2194 )] may precede or follow the \nelectron transfer step (or steps); \n3. Electron transfer ( RneO \u2194+ \u2212 ) at the electrode surface; \n4. Transport of the R\u2032 from the electrode surface to the bulk solution; \n5. Transport of electrolyte including spectator ions and chemical species. \nElectrode processes involving electron transfer can take place in several simultaneous or \nconsecutive steps. The rate of an overall reaction is affected not only by the reaction \nprocesses at the electrode surface but also by the mass transport of species at the interface \nbetween the bulk solution and electrode surface region. Mass transfer can have \ncontributions from: i) diffusion along concentration gradients; ii) migration when an \nelectric field is present; and iii) convection in the presence of any form of agitation or \nforced motion. In traditional electrochemical systems, it is usual practice to design \nexperiments where the conditions present facilitate the treatment of recorded data (e.g. \nleading to simplification of the electrochemical equations required for the calculation of \nkinetic parameters with the removal of unwanted factors). For example, an inert \nsupporting electrolyte of \u2265 0.1 mol dm\u20133 concentration is often added to reduce migration \neffects and ohmic losses, and convection can either be avoided by preventing stirring and \nvibrations in the system being studied or precisely controlled using hydrodynamic \ntechniques (see Section 3.11). However, the operational conditions typically found in \nMFCs [e.g. \u2264 50 mmol dm\u20133 (low concentrations) of stirred electrolyte] are predefined by \nthe requirements of the microbes for optimum growth and metabolism and are not \nnecessarily compatible with the objectives of an electrochemical study. Careful \nexperimental design is essential in MFC studies when the aim of a study is to determine \n 10\nfundamental kinetic parameters and the data must have some form of mass transport as \nwell as ohmic corrections. \nA potential pathway for DET between biofilm and electrode is shown in Fig. 2a. The \nregion of biofilm formation on the electrode surface is critical to the operation of a MFC \nand both living and dead cells are present in the self\u2013generating biofilm. The following \nsteps can occur during the electrode reaction: \n1. Transport of the substrate from the bulk solution to the biofilm region;  \n2. Transport of the substrate in biofilm region;  \n3. Metabolisms inside the different microorganisms that are present; \n4. DET between the biofilm (i.e. the active sites of extracellular enzymes of the \nmicroorganisms) and the electrode; \n5. Transport of the metabolites and the reaction products; \n6. Transport of electrolyte including spectator ions and chemical species. \nFor anode reactions, living cells in the biofilm consume the substrate (electron donors) \nthat is transferred from the bulk solution and the cellular metabolisms consist of a series \nof enzyme reactions, some of which yield the electrons. The intrinsic electron relay \noccurs in the microbes during the biological metabolism and a proportion of these \nelectrons can be collected by the anode via extracellular cytochromes (when present).  \nThe biofilm thickness is greater than the electrode surface region and the positions of \nextracellular enzymes have an important influence on the DET reactions (Fig. 2a):  \na) DET can occur only when the active sites of extracellular enzymes are sufficiently \nclose to the electrode surface;  \n 11\nb) When microbial cells in the biofilm are a certain distance from the electrode surface, \nit is impossible for DET generation to occur via extracellular cytochromes;  \nc) Some microbial cells contain electrically conductive pili, which can extend for tens \nof micrometers and may serve as electrical conduits for long range direct electron \ntransfer.  \nMost redox proteins are known to undergo very slow heterogeneous electron transfer at \nelectrode surfaces and exhibit irreversible electrochemical behaviour; one limitation of \nDET is that the active sites are typically buried deeply in the enzymes, which results in \npoor electrode kinetics. Fig. 2b illustrates the possible scenarios for indirect electron \ntransfer (IET). Electroactive metabolites, such as phenazine, H2 or HS\u2013, are produced by \nthe living cells in the bulk solution and\/or in the biofilm and can react at the electrode \nsurface. There are two primary mechanisms by which this can take place: \na) When the cells are in contact with the electrode (i.e. the electroactive metabolites \nreleased from the cells are already on the electrode surface), the electron transfer \nreaction can occur with preceding and\/or subsequent chemical reactions and\/or \nsurface reactions;  \nb) When the electroactive metabolites are released away from the electrode surface \n(e.g. by the suspended cells in the bulk solution), mass transport must occur in \naddition to the chemical reactions, electron transfer, and\/or other surface \nreactions. \nIn some earlier studies,2 artificial redox mediators (e.g. neutral red) were added to MFCs \nto enhance electron transfer processes. There are, however, often undesirable \nconsequences when doing this (all of which make the use of such artificial mediators an \n 12\nunsuitable choice for sustainable electricity generation in MFCs): these species tend to be \ntoxic, they require regular addition and they often cause environmental problems. This \nreview will not further discuss the functions of these artificial mediators. \nIn summary, there is typically a large variety of microbial species in commercially \nrelevant MFCs, but only a part of these diverse consortia is involved in electrode \nreactions. The pathways for the electrode reactions, DET or IET, are interlinked and the \nprocesses involve a complex sequence of coupled steps. Microbial kinetics are directly \nlinked to the reactions occurring at the electrode. Microbial growth is dependent on the \nsubstrate, metabolites and microbial concentrations, and an adaptation of the biofilm \nstructure, and\/or a change of the microbial community, will influence the electrochemical \ncharacteristics. The porosities and pore dimensions of the biofilm affect the transfer of \nmetabolites to the electrode surface. Thick biofilms might enhance DET, but yield \nincreased mass transfer losses (and associated impedances \u2013 see section 3). The transfer \nof protons, substrate and metabolites between electrode surface and bulk solution will \nalso have an effect on the current generation.21 For IET systems, higher power outputs are \noften obtained with the presence of higher concentrations of metabolites. The rate of the \noverall electrode reaction is determined by the rate of the slowest step in the sequence of \ncoupled reactions. The metabolism of the microbes is generally the rate\u2013limiting step and \nthis limits the rate of current generation to that dictated by the rate of substrate oxidation \nby the active microbes; current cannot be generated at an electrode faster than the rate \nthat the microbes can oxidise a substrate and transfer electrons to the electrode. \n \n 13\n2.3 Microbes, configuration and operational conditions \nDifferent MFC configurations have been designed for both batch and continuous \noperation modes: examples include two\u2013chamber, single\u2013chamber, upflow tubular and \nmini\u2013MFC configurations. Many different separator types have been used in MFCs and \nthese include:22,23 cation or anion exchange membranes, bipolar membranes, nano\u2013\nporous filters etc. A large variety of microbe\u2013substrate combinations have been studied \nand new types are being continuously discovered.  \nThere are many factors that affect MFC performance and even one small, seemingly \ninsignificant change can lead to a significant substantial deterioration in performance. \nThe correct choice of experimental technique(s) for any specific research objective is \nvery important. Testing of identical MFCs in parallel must be conducted to evaluate \nreproducibility and repeatability; data from only one test may lead to misunderstandings \ndue to the complex nature MFC systems. \n \n \n3. Electrochemical\/electroanalytical techniques \nThe power generated by a MFC is quantified in terms of power output, P = Vcell (V) \u00d7 I \n(A). The open circuit voltage (OCV) is the voltage of a MFC under a no\u2013load condition \n(no current generation) and can be measured with a high impedance voltmeter or \npotentiometer. The open circuit potential (OCP) is the potential of an electrode (cathode \nor anode) measured against a suitable RE, again using a high impedance\u2013measuring \ndevice. An overpotential, a measure of the irreversibility of the processes occurring, is the \ndifference between the equilibrium (reversible) potential of an electrode with zero net \n 14\ncurrent and its operating potential with a net current flow; it broadly represents the extra \nenergy (\u201ckick\u201d) needed to force the electrode reactions to proceed at the required rate.24 \nThe cell voltage of a MFC can be expressed in terms of the overpotentials associated with \ndifferent fundamental phenomena as shown in the following equations:25 \nohmaconcaactacconccactccell EEE \u03b7\u03b7\u03b7\u03b7\u03b7 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212= ,,,,                Equation (1) \nohmaconcaactacconccactccell IRIRIREIRIREE \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212= ,,,,        Equation (2) \nwhere Ec and Ea are the reversible OCPs for the cathodic and anodic reactions \nrespectively; \u03b7act are the charge transfer derived overpotentials of the anode or cathode \n(alternatively called charge transfer losses or activation losses \u2013 the subscripts a = anode \nand c = cathode); \u03b7conc are the concentration overpotentials of the anode or cathode (also \ncalled mass transport losses); \u03b7ohm are the ohmic overpotentials of MFCs (alternatively \ncalled ohmic losses \u2013 Ohms Law V = I \u00d7 R). Each of the overpotentials for various steps \ncan be represented with an associated resistance: Ract, Rconc, and Rohm, (Equation 2); Ract \nand Rconc are not real electrical elements and are better described as impedances,20 but \nthey can be useful for characterizing MFCs and their constituent electrode reactions e.g. \nRact is mathematically related to the much more important exchange current density, a \nparameter discussed later in Section 3.3. Caution is required in using the term of \u201cinternal \nresistance\u201d as the chemical fuel cell community considers this to refer to Rohm only, \nwhereas many MFC studies use the term to mean the sum of all of the Ract, Rohm and Rconc \nthat are present in the system. A small impedance (resistance) represents a low \noverpotential and a rapid process; a key challenge for improving MFC power outputs is \nto reduce these impedances. \n \n 15\n3.1 MFC polarization techniques   \nThe term \u201cpolarization\u201d (which is old fashioned and sometimes misleading) is the change \nof electrode potential (or MFC voltage) from its equilibrium state due to a flow of current. \nPolarization curves are plots of electrode potential (or MFC voltage) as a function of \ncurrent or current density. Such plots contain a wealth of information and can easily be \nobtained with a suitable potentiostat (capable of measuring power inputs \u2013 i.e. power is \nsupplied to the instrument from the power source being studied) or a variable external \nresistance load; for highly reproducible, precise measurements it is essential that an \nelectronic load with the appropriate current ranges is used. \nThere are four options for the measurement of MFC polarization discharge curves: (a) \nconstant resistance discharge measured by connecting different resistors to the MFC and \nmeasuring the resulting currents and voltages; (b) potentiodynamic polarization, i.e. \nlinear sweep voltammetry (LSV) where current is measured with slow voltage scan rate \n(e.g. 1 mV s-1); (c) galvanostatic discharge, where the current is controlled and the \nresulting voltages measured; and (d) potentiostatic discharge, where the voltage is \ncontrolled and the resulting currents measured.  \nFor the above options, constant potential (potentiostatic) discharge measurements may \nbe the most suitable for investigations that are probing the fundamental science that is \ninvolved in biofuel cells, especially when the electrochemistry of enzymes is involved: i) \nelectroactive biological species (enzymes) can rapidly switch their activities on or off \ndepending on the potentials present; hydrogenase fuel cell catalysts are a classic example \nas they can suddenly switch off (deactivate) when the potentials are raised beyond a \ncertain point, this being due to the oxidation of the metal centres to non\u2013active oxidation \n 16\nstates.26 This is in contrast to chemical fuel cell studies where constant current \n(galvanostatic) discharges are preferred as constant reaction rates (electron \ngeneration\/consumption rates) are occurring at the electrodes. ii) for constant resistance \ndischarge techniques, both the current outputs and cell voltages will be varying with time \n(two variables, however small their variation). In comparison, potentiostatic experiments \ninvolve controlled and constant cell voltages and require only measurement of the current \n(the only major electronic variable). Constant potential and current data are useful when \nMFCs are designed as power supplies for practical systems; constant resistance values do \nnot yield much useful information for MFC studies, especially when MFCs of different \nconfigurations and dimensions are being compared. Even when chemical fuel cells have \nbeen tested for real world scenarios, the variable load has been via a controlled and time \nvarying current profile (and not by a external resistance profile). The use of electronic \nloads has clearly benefited the development of chemical fuel cells. Constant resistance \nmeasurements are not necessary when accurate electronic loads or battery\/fuel cell test \nequipments are available. iii) finally, it is often difficult to determine when using LSV \nmeasurements (even with a slow scan rate) if a system is achieving a steady state for each \ndata point collected. The factors affecting the steady state operation for MFCs are much \nmore complicated than for traditional electrochemical systems. \nThe time that should be left for equilibration before recording data points at each \nresistance\/current\/potential is still being debated (seconds, minutes, hours). Unlike with a \nchemical fuel cell (times frames in the range of several seconds to several minutes are \ntypically used when recording galvanostatic data, after which steady potentials are \nnormally achieved), it is difficult to record a credible steady state polarization curve with \n 17\na MFC for the following principlal reasons: (a) the nature of the microbial \nspecies\/communities is evolving with time and electrode potential, with concurrent \nchanges in the biofilm (for chemical fuel cells, the composition and structure of catalysts \nchange only very slowly with time via various degradation reactions \u2013 < 100 \u03bcV h\u20131 in \nwell the best systems); (b) the concentrations of electroactive metabolites and\/or substrate \nmay also be constantly changing with time and potential (chemical fuel cells supplied \nwith gases can be tested or operated with very precise and constant fuel\/oxidant supplies); \nfinally (c) the mechanisms of electrode reactions and operational conditions may be \ndifferent for each different type of MFC, each requiring different sampling rates. MFCs \ncan exhibit stable behaviour in simple time\u2013related voltage and current experiments using \nfixed resistance load, but long\u2013term polarization testing requires caution as there is a \ncontinual risk of the presence of the above changes.27,10 In contemporary MFC studies, \npseudo\u2013steady state conditions are generally present during testing and a minimum of \nseveral minutes per data point is necessary. The optimum time for data point recording \nneeds further discussion by MFC researchers, as it will inevitably be a function of the \nsystem being studied and can affect numerous parameters. \nAn ideal polarization curve for a power generation device (MFC or chemical fuel cell) \nincludes three characteristic regions located at different current ranges (either well \nsegregated, as is typical with chemical fuel cells, or with varying and significant levels of \noverlap, as is more typical with MFCs) as shown in Fig. 3a and summarised below: \na) The region of charge transfer overpotentials (\u03b7act,a + \u03b7act,c) is located at low \ncurrents and derives from the slowness (irreversibility) of the reactions taking \nplace on the surface of the electrodes. The charge transfer overpotentials depend \n 18\non the nature of the electrode materials, catalysts, reactant activities, electrolyte \nincluding any spectator species that are present, electrochemical mediators, \nbiofilm, electrode microstructure, microbial species and their metabolisms, and \noperational conditions such as temperature;  \nb) Ohmic overpotentials typically manifest themselves at intermediate currents in \nthe polarization curve and are caused by ionic resistances in the electrolyte \n(especially for MFCs, due to low ionic concentrations), membrane, and biofilm, \nand by electronic resistances in the electrodes, current collectors, interconnects, \nand the electronic components between the measuring instrument and the power \ngeneration device under study; \nc) Mass transport overpotentials result from the changes in concentration of the \nreactants (or products) at the interface between electrode surface region and bulk \nelectrolyte; this overpotential is prevalent at relatively high current densities if \nthe reactants cannot be supplied to the electrode reaction zones at the rate \nrequired to sustain the generation of current. The presence of high concentrations \nof product species can also lead to the reduction of transport of reactants to where \nthey are needed. Mass transfer derived overpotentials are affected by the \ngeometry and the structure of electrodes and biofilm, the nature of the electrolyte, \nthe metabolites, and the products that are present. \n \n3.2 Electrode polarization techniques   \nA MFC polarization curve yields the overall fuel cell performance under specific \noperating conditions, but fails to give information on the performances of the individual \n 19\nelectrodes (anode or cathode), hence it is difficult to elucidate the limiting factor of MFC \nperformance. However, a RE can be easily introduced in one or more of the MFC \nchambers so that it is possible to record the individual potentials of anode or cathode (as \nwell as the overall cell voltage of the MFC \u2013 modern electrochemical testers can measure \nthe impedance spectra of all of these simultaneously, see Section 3.5); single electrode \npolarization curves can, therefore, be easily obtained as shown in Fig. 3b. The \noverpotentials of a MFC are the sum of the (non\u2013linear) overpotentials of the anode and \ncathode and the (linear) internal ohmic overpotentials of the MFC. By analysing the \npotential changes of the anode and the cathode at varying currents, the performance \nlimiting factor can often be revealed. For example, a previous study showed that a \nbiocathode showed inferior performance compared to the anode,28 and that increasing the \nefficiency or surface area of the cathode should be targeted to enhance power generation. \nAs it will become apparent in Section 3.5, to simplify analyses and to reveal more \ninformation, polarization plots can be corrected for IRohm losses i.e. IR\u2013corrected voltages \n(= Vcell + I \u00d7 Rint) can be plotted against log10 I, where Rohm is the internal ohmic \nresistances between the relevant electrodes; an example of this is found Figure 4 of \nreference 29. \nIn a three\u2013electrode configuration, it is possible to obtain the performance of an \nindividual anode or cathode using a variety of techniques including galvanodynamic or \npotentiodynamic measurements (other relevant techniques are detailed in the sections \nbelow). Galvanodynamic measurements12 have been used to investigate the cathode \nperformance of cobalt\u2013 and iron\u2013based ORR catalysts in different concentrations of \naqueous electrolyte. It was demonstrated that limited buffering capacities of the \n 20\nelectrolyte will lead to undesirable decreases in the cathode performance due to pH \nchanges at the cathode. Rosenbaum et al.30 used galvanodynamic electrochemical \nmethods to evaluate the anode performance and electrocatalytic activity with microbial \nfermentation products; hydrogen, formate, and lactate can be oxidised by tungsten \ncarbide catalysts in a neutral pH electrolyte, whilst no activity was observed for ethanol \nelectro\u2013oxidation. Potentiodynamic methods were used by Manohar et al.31 to compare \nthe performances of anodes in buffer, buffer\u2013substrate, and buffer\u2013substrate\u2013microbe \nsystems; the analysis of their results allowed the determination of the exchange current \ndensities and Tafel slopes, detailed below. \n \n3.3 Butler\u2013Volmer equation and tafel curves  \nCharge transfer overpotentials are controlled by the rate of heterogeneous electron \ntransfer, and the kinetics of this process are described by the Butler\u2013Volmer equation20 \nwhen the reactants are abundant and the current is small enough that the ohmic and \nconcentration overpotentials are negligible: \n( )\n\u23ad\u23ac\n\u23ab\n\u23a9\u23a8\n\u23a7 \u2212= \u239f\u23a0\u239e\u239c\u239d\u239b\u239f\u23a0\u239e\u239c\u239d\u239b \u2212\n\u2212\nRT\naactnF\nRT\ncactnF\neeAiI o\n,1, \u03b7\u03b1\u03b7\u03b1\n                                    Equation (3) \nwhere I is the current, A is the electrode active surface area, io is the exchange current \ndensity, \u03b1 is the charge transfer barrier (symmetry coefficient), n is number of electrons \ninvolved in the electrode reaction, and \u03b7act. is the charge transfer overpotential. Typical \nelectrode reactions occur in more than one elementary step, and there is an overpotential \nassociated with each step. The io is a fundamental parameter in the rate of \nelectrooxidation or electroreduction of a chemical specie at an electrode at equilibrium; a \n 21\nlarge io indicates a fast reaction (approaching reversible, as found with the hydrogen \noxidation reaction at a Pt electrode), whereas a small io indicates a slow reaction (often an \nirreversible electrode reaction, such as the reduction of oxygen (often irreversible even \nwhen employing Pt electrodes).  \nThe Butler\u2013Volmer equation can be simplified to equation (4) in the high overpotential \nregion (> 118\/n mV, where n is the number of electrons exchanged), yielding the Tafel \nequation:20,25 \n( )\noi\ni\nact b 10. log=\u03b7                                                           Equation (4) \nwhere i is the current density and b is Tafel slope (mV dec\u20131), which is an important \nexperimental parameter commonly used to probe the mechanism of an electrode reaction. \nPlots of overpotential against log10 i are known as Tafel Plots (see Fig. 4); io and b are \nobtained by extrapolation of the linear region of the curve to \u03b7act. = 0.  \nExchange currents or exchange current densities in MFCs have previously been \ncalculated from Tafel plots.12,31,32 Several methods have been proposed with the aim of \nreducing charge transfer overpotentials and therefore increasing io:  \n1. Improved catalysts or biocatalysts, which can considerably decrease activation \nbarriers, have been used to improve the electrode performance; \n2. Modification of the electrodes can significantly alter the biofilm composition of \nelectrode surface, which can facilitate an electrode process such as the direct \nelectron transfer between a protein and the electrode, or can produce selectivity \ntoward a particular process (especially in EFC studies);32  \n3. Utilisation of electrode materials with higher specific surface area (e.g. with a \nhighly porous structure) has the potential to provide more available reaction sites \n 22\nfor electrode reactions and increase the geometric current density. Microbes may \nnot be able to access the surface areas inside smaller sized pores, however, ignoring \nthe specific surface area of the electrode materials (especially with carbon based \nelectrodes, where these surface areas are easily obtained using gas \nabsorption\/mercury porosimetry measurements) may lead to a loss of vital \ninformation. An example is that a electrode with higher specific surface area \nsubstantially improved performances for sulphide oxidation;19 \n4. The rates of chemical reactions involving electroactive metabolites are generally \nfaster than for reactions involving biological metabolisms; employing optimised \noperational conditions (e.g. raising the temperature to levels optimal for microbial \nmetabolism and for maximum enzyme reaction activity and\/or increasing the \nconcentrations of reactants)33 may be effective; \n5. The evolution of microbial species can be adapted to allow enhanced electrode \nperformance; analysis of gene expression and identification of beneficial mutations \ncan allow improvements via genetic engineering and the identification of more of \nthe electroactive species and more effective biofilm structures.  \n \n3.4 Current interruption (CI) \nCI techniques have been used extensively to measure the internal ohmic resistance of \nchemical fuel cells and more recently of MFCs.27 As shown in Fig. 5, the basic principle \nof the CI is to interrupt the current flow and to observe the resulting voltage transients. \nOn current interruption, the ohmic overpotential is separated from other overpotentials as \nthe former is a near instantaneous process, whereas the relaxation times for other voltage \n 23\nloss phenomena are significantly longer. CI measurements can be conducted using low \ncost electronic equipment, and resulting data are easily interpreted. The primary \ndisadvantage is that very short duration (< 10 \u00b5sec) measurements of the perturbation to \nthe system are required for precise and accurate determinations, and it is possible to \noverestimate the voltage changes if data collection is not rapid enough (sample rate is too \nlow). Another disadvantage of using CI is that it is difficult to distinguish between charge \ntransfer and mass transfer impedances.  \n \n3.5 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) \nEIS takes advantage of the large spectrum of time scales over which different processes \noccur in the system being studied. It is a powerful tool for examining chemical and \nphysical processes in solutions, at solid\u2013liquid interfaces and at solid\u2013solid interfaces, as \nit allows the separation of the different voltage loss phenomena.20,29,34,35 There are two \ncommon graphical representations used in EIS: Nyquist plots and Bode plots (Fig.6). The \nmain shortcoming of Nyquist plots is that it does not show the frequency represented by \neach data point (each point being a representation of the impedance vector in the complex \nplane at a particular frequency); Bode plots show this frequency information as they are \nplots of the magnitude and phase angle of the impedance vector versus frequency. \nRecently, MFC studies using EIS have been reported.31,36,37 A small amplitude (e.g. 10 \nmV rms \u2013 rms = root mean squared) alternating current (a.c. \u2013 sine wave) perturbation \nsignal is applied to the MFC being tested; small perturbations are used to ensure non\u2013\nlinear harmonic effects are not interfering with the data collection and also to prevent \ndamage to the biofilm attached to the electrode surface (systems are often perturbed far \n 24\nfrom equilibrium in the cyclic voltammetry or potential step methods detailed in Section \n3.6). To avoid non\u2013linear responses when measuring EIS spectra at different currents or \npotentials, it is vital that the d.c. polarization curves are inspected first so that the correct \nsettings can be deduced. The amplitude of either the voltage or current perturbations \n(when conducting experiments with potential or current control respectively) must be \nselected such that responses will be linear at steady or pseudo\u2013steady state conditions \n(Fig. 7) and within the current\/voltage ranges of the electronic equipment used in the test \ne.g. do not use a voltage perturbation signal that will result in a current amplitude (e.g. 10 \nnA) that is smaller than the current measuring resolution (e.g. 0.1 \u03bcA) of the instrument. \nIn general, it is best to use the smallest perturbation signal that still produces noise free \ndata; perturbations of large amplitude will result in distortions of the EIS spectrum due to \nnon-linear responses. \nDetailed information on the ohmic internal resistances, and on the charge and mass \ntransfer impedances, can be obtained on the analysis of correctly collected EIS spectra. \nThe Nyquist plot and the Bode plots of a single chamber MFC with an air cathode \ndeveloped for wastewater treatment are shown in Fig. 6. The ohmic internal resistance is \noften determined by the high frequency intercept of the curve with the real impedance \naxis (Zre \u2013 the x\u2013axis).20 The internal ohmic resistances recorded using EIS data are much \nmore accurate than when using simple single frequency resistance measurements (1 kHz \nmeasurements are commonly employed in cheap ohmmeters). EIS can, like CI, \noverestimate internal ohmic resistances, especially at high d.c. discharge current densities; \nhowever, this overestimation tends to occur at current densities of > 0.5 A cm\u20132 \n 25\n(geometric) achievable in H2\/O2 chemical fuel cells, which are unlikely to be achieved \nwith MFCs. \nWith EIS technique the conductivity of electrode materials and membranes can be \neasily measured. The conductivity of cation\u2013exchange membranes (CEM), such as \nNafion, can be as high as 0.1 S cm\u20131, but only when the CEM is in the proton\u2013exchange \nform (H+ conduction). Conductivities of these membranes are lower when in the Na+ \/ K+ \n\/ Ca2+ forms since H+ ions have higher mobilities than metal cations, mainly because \nproton conduction involves the Grotthuss mechanism;38 CEMs are likely be present in \nMFCs in a form where a variety of metal cations or other chemical species are present. \nCareful selection of materials, MFC configurations, electrode spacing, and electrolyte \nconcentration will allow reductions in ohmic losses. Salt-bridge-containing or high \ninternal resistance (ca. 3.9 M\u03a9) systems39 have limited power generation because most of \nthe electricity being generated is dissipated as heat (not a desirable outcome: MFCs \noperating at ambient temperatures will never be applicable as co\u2013generation systems). \nThe conductivity of the electrode material has a practical importance. It is rarely a serious \nissue with lab scale MFCs, but low conductivity will lead to major problems \n(uneconomic performances) at the pilot scale or with full scale devices. The thickness and \nconductivity (an intrinsic property) of the electrolyte membrane also affect the internal \nohmic resistance of the energy generation device. Thin membranes reduce ionic \nresistance but tend to have a higher rate of oxygen crossover to anode compartment, \nwhich undesirably reduces coulombic efficiency and\/or power production; thin \nmembrane electrolytes might also lead to an increase in the crossover of other species to \nthe cathode, which leads to performance limitations i.e. additional mass transport and\/or \n 26\nactivation derived losses (catalyst poisoning or blocking of surface sites for ORR). A \nradical modification is achieved through the removal of the electrolyte membrane \u2013 the \nmembrane\u2013less system. Cheng et al.40 reported the maximum power production of a \nmembrane\u2013less MFC achieved with a 2 cm dimensional spacing between the anode and \ncathode; the power decreased with reduced space due to oxygen crossover from the \ncathode side to the anode chamber; the studies suggest that the anode and cathode \nspacing should be less than 2 cm for high power generation when a separator is present in \nMFCs.  \nCharge transfer processes occur with smaller time constants (= Ract \u00d7 Cdl if modelled \nby parallel RC circuits in EIS, where Ract is the charge transfer impedance and Cdl is the \ncapacitance of the electrode\u2019s double layer) when compared to mass transport \n(diffusion\/migration) processes. Processes occurring with different time constants can \noften be identified using EIS measurements. For example, the difference between the \ncharge transfer parallel RC impedance (kinetic control \u2013 semicircle at medium\u2013high \nfrequencies) can be clearly distinguished from the mass transfer derived impedances \n(sloped line at low frequencies in Fig. 6a). Charge and mass transport related impedances \nare common non\u2013ohmic phenomena and require overpotentials to enable a current flow; \nthe diameter of the semicircular charge transfer RC-related impedance response in \nNyquist plots will change exponentially with overpotential (or electrode potential). The \ncapacitance of the interface between electrode and solution changes when a biofilm \nattaches to the surface of electrode. Manohar et al.31 found, using EIS methods, that in \nthe presence of the species MR\u20131 the OCP of an anode became more negative and the \ncapacitance increased; both of these affected the MFC power output. \n 27\nTo reduce mass transfer impedances in MFCs, the electrode structure and \nconfiguration should be designed to facilitate the rapid transport of the reactants, products, \nsupporting electrolyte and substrate in order to avoid excessive concentration-derived \npolarizations. The accumulation of metabolites in the biofilm can hinder microbial \nactivity, whilst mass transport between the anode and cathode chambers tends to alter the \npH in each and results in further performance decreases. Stirring and forced convection \nenhances mass transport and have been shown to improve the power output of EFCs;41 \nMFCs exhibit analogous behaviour e.g. the anode reaction in a sulphur\u2013pollutant\u2013\ncontaining wastewater treatment system was controlled by a diffusion process.18 \nAppropriate stirring or forced convection may lead to denser biofilms in systems \noperating with a direct electron transfer mechanism, leading to enhanced anode \nperformances. For systems operating with indirect electron transfer, the concentration of \nelectroactive metabolites has an important effect on current outputs;19,42 higher \nconcentrations of electroactive metabolites may reduce the mass transport and charge \ntransfer impedances, as well as internal ohmic resistances by solution conductivity \nincrease. A MFC combined with a reservoir that is designed for the accumulation of \nelectroactive metabolites is a technology that promises high current outputs.  \nIn comparison with CI, EIS is a very sensitive technique yielding a wealth of \ninformation such as kinetic parameters, determination of the reaction mechanisms, \nelectrolyte and electrode conductivities, and biofilm behaviours. However, MFC studies, \ndue to their complexity, need to be undertaken carefully in terms of how they approach \nEIS data collection and analysis, especially when equivalent circuit modelling is used to \ninterpret results and the reaction mechanism of electrode is not known. Each EIS \n 28\nequivalent circuit element introduced (resistor, capacitance or inductor) must represent \nsomething in the real system: the tendency to unnecessarily increase the number of circuit \nelements, or to replace capacitors with constant phase elements without justification, in \norder to gain better fits to the collected data must be avoided. \n \n3.6 Cyclic voltammetry (CV)  \nThe determination of the mechanisms of electrode reactions underlying oxidation or \nreduction reactions can be achieved using a variety of electrochemical techniques. The \nmost common and straightforward technique is CV, which requires a three-electrode \nconfiguration to obtain accurate results. Fig. 8 shows the important parameters that can \nbe obtained from CV of a reversible redox couple (Fe(CN)63- + e\u2013 \u2192 Fe(CN)64-). It is \nrelatively easy to show using CV whether a chemical system under study is reversible or \nirreversible: for a fully electrokinetically reversible couple, the ratio of anodic to cathodic \npeak currents = 1 and the potential separations between the peak potentials = 59.2 mV\/n \nat room temperature, where n is the number of electrons transferred in the electrode \nreaction. Compared to reversible systems, quasi- or irreversible phenomena will exhibit \nlarger separations between peak potentials and\/or one or more peaks that are reduced in \nsize (the electron transfer process takes more time to respond to the applied potential in \nthese non-reversible systems). MFC studies employing CV generally use forward and \nbackward voltage sweeps with rates in the range of 1 \u2013 100 mV s\u20131. Multiple peaks in the \ncyclic voltammograms of bio\u2013electrochemical system may be observed due to multi\u2013step \nparallel or consecutive (series) mechanisms, or to the presence of several different redox \nspecies.  \n 29\nIn protein film voltammetry, the analysis of the first derivative of CV allows the \nestimation of the potential at which the rate of increase of the catalytic wave reaches a \nmaximum; this has been used to reveal that the oxidative and reductive potential sweep \npossess two (or more) inflection points in some systems.26,43 \nIn MFC studies, CV experiments have been used extensively to: (i) investigate the \nmechanisms of electrode reactions involving both direct and indirect electron transfer \nbetween the biofilm and the electrode; (ii) determine the redox potentials of the chemical \nor biological species involved at the anode or cathode (for a reversible redox couple, the \naverage of the cathodic and anodic peak gives the reversible potential for that couple \nreferenced against the RE being employed); and (iii) to evaluate the performance of the \ncatalysts being studied.  \nFor anode reactions, only microbial extracellular cytochromes have been proven, to \ndate, to be active for direct electron transfer mechanisms. However, some CV\u2013based \nMFC studies shows characteristics of inter-conversion between active\u2013inactive states, i.e. \ninactivation is observed during the positive potential sweep and reactivation is observed \non the return sweep; this is not an expected behaviour of cytochromes but is similar with \nthat of enzymes (e.g. hydrogenase) that have been studied in EFCs.26 The shape of these \nvoltammograms is an initial indication that \u201cturnover\u201d enzymes or multi-enzyme systems \nmight be contributing to the anodic current. \nCV is a simple technique and results are obtained in a relatively short time. However, \nbackground experiments (with blank electrolyte) are mandatory for high quality \nmechanistic studies. When microbial communities are present in MFC chambers, the \npeak current and the peak potential coming from the electrode interface reactions might \n 30\ninvolve direct electron transfer and\/or indirect electron transfer. For complex systems, \nwhere there are many unknowns (especially relevant to wastewaters), the following CV \ntesting protocols are recommended, as a minimum, to aid understanding:  \na) Effects of electrode and electrolyte: Employ a biofilm\u2013less electrode in un\u2013\ninoculated or abiotic electrolyte; \nb) Effect of the biofilm: Employ a biofilm-coated electrode in the un\u2013inoculated or \nabiotic electrolyte; \nc) Effect of the substrate: Employ a biofilm\u2013less and a biofilm-coated electrode in the \nun\u2013inoculated or  abiotic electrolyte with the addition of fresh substrate;  \nd) Effects of the suspended cells: Employ a biofilm\u2013less electrode in an inoculated \nelectrolyte; \ne) Effect of the metabolites: Employ a biofilm\u2013less electrode in the inoculated \nelectrolyte with consumed substrate(s). \nBy comparing the results of these CV experiments (i.e. the peak currents and the peak \npotentials at same scan rate using a same size electrode) the electron transfer mechanisms \nof the electrode should be clarified to an extent. The collection of reproducible CV scans \nis required for rigorous understanding, especially in systems with low concentrations of \nelectroactive metabolites.  \nThe characteristics of CV depend on several factors, such as the electrode surface \npretreatment, the rate of the electron transfer reactions, the chemical and biological \nspecies present and their thermodynamic properties, the concentration of electroactive \nspecies and their rates of diffusion and the sweep rate. It should be noted that many \nelectrode materials used in MFCs cannot produce reversible electrochemical reactions \n 31\neven for the classic reversible redox couple Fe(CN)63-\/Fe(CN)64-. The main reason for \nthis is that the heterogeneous processes of electrode reactions can be significantly \naffected by the microstructure, roughness and function groups present on the electrode \nsurface. One example is that a simple electrode will often produce different \nelectrochemical reaction rates before and after polishing, and will show different CV \nprofiles. When the accurate determination of kinetic parameters is investigated, it is \nessential that the electrodes and the operational conditions are appropriate. \n \n3.7 Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) \nDPV is a voltammetric technique with an improved sensitivity compared to CV and LSV \nmethods. An important limitation of both CV and LSV is the substantial background \nlevels from capacitive, non\u2013Faradaic currents. Enhanced discrimination of Faradaic \ncurrents (electron transfer to and from an electrode) can be obtained using DPV, where \nthe potential perturbation consists of small pulses is superimposed upon a staircase \nwaveform. DPV studies can also provide improved selectivity for observing different \nredox processes compared with CV and LSV. \nIn DPV measurements using sterile carbon electrodes in a growth medium and with \ncarbon electrodes colonised by Shewanella, Marsili et al.44 found that a layer of flavins \nwas adsorbed on the electrodes and these acted as external electron transfer acceptors \n(especially in older biofilms), lower concentrations of secondary compounds were \npresent in the electrolyte.  \n \n \n 32\n3.8 Chronoamperometry (CA) \nCA is an electrochemical technique where the potential of anode or cathode is controlled \n(or stepped) and then held constant with the resulting currents being monitored as a \nfunction of time. Bond et al.45 inoculated a MFC chamber containing Geobacter \nsulfurreducens, acetate as the electron donor, and a graphite electrode held at an \noxidising potential (+200 mV versus Ag\/AgCl). A DET process was indicated for the \nMFC as the biofilm electrode continued, unaffected, to generate an acetate\u2013dependent \ncurrent when the medium was replaced with an anaerobic buffer lacking nutrients. It is \nimportant to appreciate that the anode potentials influence and regulate biofilm activity as \nwell as the microbial cell growth rate. The study of three comparable reactors, containing \nmicrobial communities that were continuously fed with acetate, with anode potentials \npoised at 0, \u2212200 and \u2212400 mV versus Ag\/AgCl respectively, led to the conclusion that \nthe optimal anode was at \u2212200 mV under the conditions tested.27 In another experiment, a \ntungsten carbide modified anode was immersed in a glucose substrate solution that had \nbeen freshly inoculated with heat-treated soil, and data on microbial growth and \noxidation of metabolites as function of time were recorded.30 A final example is where \nboth carbon fibre veil and activated carbon cloth anodes were compared during a study of \nthe oxidation current for microbially produced sulphide at anode potentials of +200 mV \nversus Ag\/AgCl; the highly porous activated carbon cloth electrode gave substantially \nbetter performances.18 \n \n 33\n3.9 Chronopotentiometry (CP) \nCP involves the study of potential as a function a time at an electrode operating with a \nconstant current (the opposite of CA above). A recent study using this technique \ninvestigated air cathodes coated with polytetrafluoroethylene containing layers.46 The \nelectrode potentials of the layered carbon cloth electrodes were measured whilst applying \na constant current. The resulting potentials were then plotted as a function of current \ndensities to evaluate the electrode performances. A maximum performance was achieved \nwith coulombic efficiencies of up to 42% when a four-layer-coated electrode was \nemployed.  \n \n3.10 Other simple time\u2013related voltage, potential and current measurements \nThere are other basic techniques that can be employed to investigate both MFCs and the \nindividual performances of electrodes as a function of time without precise control of \npotential or current. Information such as voltage versus time profiles, acclimation times, \nthe effects of substrate addition and\/or depletion, electrolyte effects, and the changes in \ncurrent on bacterial evolution and enrichment can all be obtained.47,48 \nThe potential of various carbon based anodes as a function of time in wastewater \ncontaining sulphur pollutants was recently investigated.19 The results indicated that the \nanodic potential was primarily controlled by the concentration of microbially produced \nsulphide in the solution. Another study, that analysed potential\/time curves, showed that \nbiologically produced H2 also had an effect on the behavior of modified Pt anodes.49 \nThese studies demonstrate that the electroactive species (not only the biofilm) should be \n 34\nconsidered when probing electrode mechanisms, such species are commonly found in \nwastewaters and significantly affect the electrode performance.  \n  \n3.11 Rotating\u2013disk electrode (RDE) and rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE)  \nHydrodynamic techniques, such as RDE and RRDE, are electrochemical experiments \nwhere mass transfer is carefully controlled and are essential for studying the precise \nkinetic parameters of electron transfer and for detailed probing of electrochemical \nreaction mechanisms. These techniques have been used in the evaluation of catalyst or \nmodified electrode performances and for quantifying the number of electrons involved in \nORR.20 The desired cathode process is the full (4e\u2013) reduction of oxygen to water, but \npartial (2e\u2013) ORR will occur on carbon-based electrodes and results in the production of \nsignificant quantities of highly reactive hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which may affect \nmicrobial metabolism. RRDE studies involve a RDE with an additional ring electrode \n(poised at a separately controlled potential \u2013 hence the need for a bipotentiostat) to \nidentify the products (including peroxides) of the electrochemical reactions occurring on \nthe central disk electrode. These techniques cannot, however, always be used to probe the \nelectrochemical behaviour of biofilms on electrode surfaces since biofilm can be fragile \nand likely to be destroyed under conditions of high speed rotation. \nAnother possibility that will allow experiments with rapid mass transfer is to design \nexperiments, which can study the electrochemistry of a single microbe on some form of \nelectrochemically inactive but electronically conductive electrode surface. The hydrogen \noxidation reaction has been studied on electrode tips containing single Pt nanoparticles of \ndefined size.50 \n 35\n \n3.12 Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) \nDGGE is one of the most sensitive electrophoretic techniques available and has become a \nroutine and essential technique in the field of environmental microbiology for \ncharacterisation of microbial population structures and ecology. In many MFC studies, \nthe development (evolution) of microbial communities over time have been monitored \nusing DGGE involving polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\u2013amplified 16S rRNA gene \nfragments.51 Shewanella and Geobacter species have been proven to be electroactive \nmicrobes for direct electron transfer, but analysis of the communities in the anode biofilm \nrevealed a diversity of microbes much greater than these simple iron reducing bacteria \nalone; many novel microbes appear to be enriched in the MFCs. The types of microbes \nthat are enriched in a MFC depend strongly on the substrate and environmental \nconditions; no typical consortium has been detected from any clone library to date.52,53  \nPCR-DGGE is dependent on intact nucleic acid rather than viable or non-viable cells, \nand does not distinguish between living and dead cells in MFCs. As a consequence, it \nmay result in misleading results with the complex communities in wastewater treatment \nsystems. Much remains unknown about the role and the interactions of microbes within \nboth the electrode biofilm and the suspended communities, and the contribution towards \nelectricity generation of microbial cells at different electrode surface regions. \nUnderstanding how microbial populations and biofilm structure evolve with time is \nessential if superior MFC power levels are to be achieved.  \n \n 36\n3.13 Combined electrochemistry\u2013spectroscopy techniques \nSpectroelectrochemical techniques facilitate an in vivo understanding of molecular \nstructures, electron transfer mechanisms, and the interactions between microbes and \nelectrodes. Using direct current surface enhanced infrared (IR) absorption spectroscopy \nand subtractive interfacial Fourier transform IR spectroscopy, a recent study investigated \nthe interface between Geobacter sulfurreduces and a gold electrode.54 The analysis of the \nIR spectral bands linking the increasing presence of protein at the interface with time to \nthe increase in current, thereby demonstrating that the extracellular cytochromes were \nresponsible for the electron transfer to the gold electrode. \n \n3.14 Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM)  \nSTM and AFM are both high\u2013resolution and powerful types of microscopy. These are not \ndirect electrochemical techniques but merit inclusion as they can provide complementary \ninformation on electrode materials. STM or AFM can be used to image conducting \nsubstrates and microbial pili in MFCs studies. For example, the pili on Geobacter species \nwere recently recognised using these techniques;17 the presence of such pili raises the \npossibility of long range DET from one microbe to the electrode.  \nThe understanding of the function of these nanowires is in its infancy and the \nmechanism of how the proteins of these microbial pili interact with extracellular electron \nacceptors is poorly understood. This is an important area for future study, in which in situ \nelectrochemical (and associated) techniques will play a vital part. Techniques combining \nAFM with electrochemical measurements have recently been developed for the study of \n 37\nthe ionically conductive channels in proton\u2013exchange membrane,55 and these may have \nuses in MFC studies. \n \n3.15 Other techniques worth consideration \nAlternative electroanalytical techniques that aid in the investigation of MFCs in the future \nand to further improve the fundamental understanding of the processes occurring are: i) \nsquare wave voltammetry, which has detection limits as low as 10\u20138 mol dm\u20133 when used \nas an electroanalytical technique to determine the nature and concentrations of \nelectroactive metabolites at trace levels;20 ii) electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance \nmeasurements can be used as a non\u2013destructive on\u2013line monitoring tool with regards to \nthe formation of biofilms, and has been used to obtain information on the biofilm\u2013\nelectrode interface;56 iii) a.c. voltammetry is receiving increasing interest in the \nelectrochemical community; iv) microelectrode techniques may be useful for in situ \ninvestigations of the conductive pili; and v) electrochemistry combined with other \ntechniques, such as microarrays, microscopy, or fluorescent in situ hybridization \nexperiments, may provide a great deal of insight about the behaviour of the DNA, \nmicrobes, and other electroactive species that are present in the systems being studied. \n \n \n4. A summary of the key points \nTo date, the commercial viability of MFCs will rely on side benefits and not purely on \nthe generation of electrical power. An ever expanding range of cross\u2013disciplinary \ntechniques are now being employed to study MFCs with the aim of enhancing both \nfundamental understanding and innovation in the field. Each of the \n 38\nelectrochemical\/electoanalytical techniques described in this review provides a range of \nvaluable information that is useful in the study of MFCs. More details about these \ntechniques can be obtained from the classical electrochemistry literature e.g. reference 20. \nThe following summarises some of the key points from the main text. \n1. There are various biological and chemical reactions occurring in MFCs, but only a \nfew steps are directly involved in electron transfer processes of the electrode \nreaction. Background experiments should be conducted to identify and clarify the \nelectrochemical reaction mechanisms, and the effects of the electrode materials, \nbiofilm, substrate and metabolites. The spectator ions\/chemicals present in MFC \nsystems cannot be ignored and will fundamentally affect any electrocatalysts that \nare present. This is especially true of species such as HS\u2013, Cl\u2013, HPO42\u2013, and HCO3\u2013\n\/CO32\u2013. \n2. Experiments that measure reproducibility and repeatability (such as running \nidentical MFCs in parallel and at different times) should be conducted.  \n3. The inclusion of a reference electrode will allow the routine (and often \nsimultaneous) collections of anode, cathode and whole cell potentials at different \nMFC current outputs. Modern equipment will also allow the simultaneous \ncollection of the impedance spectra at steady or pseudo\u2013steady state conditions for \neach of the above. \n4. With the availability of low cost electronic loads or battery test systems, a constant \npotential (potentiostatic) measurement may be preferable when studying MFC \ndischarge performances. \n 39\n5. Each study must define the use of term \u201cinternal resistance\u201d. This should refer only \nto internal ohmic resistances. Ideally, the collection of IRohm corrected voltage data \nshould be routine. \n6. Keep the analysis of impedance spectra as simple as possible, and ensure that each \nelement (e.g. capacitor) that is introduced in equivalent circuit modelling is fully \njustified by the system under study, i.e. each circuit element should represent an \nidentified parameter. \n7. Carbon materials from different suppliers\/sources will not be the same. The surface \nchemistry (specific surface area, surface functionalities and morphology) of the \nelectrode materials should be evaluated because they have an effect on biofilm \nand\/or on other species.  \n8. Oxygen reduction on carbon\u2013based electrodes will produce peroxide species under \nneutral pH conditions, with 2e\u2013 oxygen reduction being predominant on carbon \nsurfaces. The effect of peroxide on the system performance (and durability) should \nbe taken into account or even studied. \n \nAcknowledgments \nThis work was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council as \npart of the Supergen5 Biological Fuel Cells Consortium programme (contract \nEP\/D047943\/1).\n 40\nReferences \n1 M.
