INTRODUCTION \n \nAn experimental and theoretical study is reported with the objective of determining the effect of scattering of THz \nradiation in random structures. On the one hand, scattering has adverse effects: it may produce false signatures in spectra \nwhen interference takes place within a scattering structure (e.g. fibres in clothing or granules of powder), or diminish and \nscramble the return signal from a suspect item secreted below garments. On the other hand, it might be used to advantage \nto determine the characteristic size, texture and location of an object concealed within a matrix of other material.  \n \nAn electromagnetic wave incident on a random array of scattering particles loses energy through absorption and \nscattering by the particles, and is thus attenuated on propagation through the scattering region. Scattered radiation may be \nre-scattered repeatedly leading to complete diffusion.  It is prohibitively difficult to obtain exact solutions of Maxwell\u2019s \nequations for wave propagation in random structures; empirical approximation methods are thus needed to relate the \npropagation of THz to the physical properties of the material. In any practical system, used for the detection or \nrecognition of illegal substances hidden on a suspect at some distance from the observer, this becomes especially \nsignificant. In previous work published in this area, it is evident that the theoretical approximations used often disagree \nwith the experimental data, especially when the wave is propagating through a dense assembly of scatterers.  Pearce and \nMittleman [1] have determined that the statistics of a collection of scattering events provide a means to identify \nindividual scattering events. However, when the same authors compared the mean free path for scattering through a \ndense collection of spheres with both exact (Mie) scattering and a quasi-crystalline approximation [2], typical differences \nof an order of magnitude are seen between experimental and theoretical values of the mean free path. In view of this, a \nmathematical procedure needs to be developed which allows the rapid prediction of the scattering and attenuation \nproperties of an inhomogeneous material. \n                                                          \n\u2217 g.p.swift@durham.ac.uk \nInvited Paper\nTerahertz and Gigahertz Electronics and Photonics V, edited by R.

The model proceeds by dividing the material into slices, whose \nthickness satisfies the following two criteria: \n \na) The thickness needs to be great enough so that there is no average correlation between the scatterer positions in \nadjacent slices, so interference effects between scattered waves for different slices will average out. \nb) The slice must, conversely, be thin enough so that simple approximations for the transmission calculation can be \nused. \n \nThe first requirement of the model is to produce a satisfactory result for transmission of the direct beam through the \nsample.  A Phase Distribution Function is used to describe the effect of the non-absorbing scatterers within the media \nand several approximations exist for its calculation.  \n \nMeasurements reported here have been carried out using a standard broadband THz spectrometer system, as reported \nelsewhere [3]. Photoconductive emitters and receivers were fabricated on low temperature grown Gallium Arsenide (LT-\nGaAs), using electrode structures of Titanium-nickel metalization. A pulsed 20fs Ti-sapphire laser beam, centred at \n780nm, of 76MHz repetition rate was used for the THz generation and detection. The beam was mechanically chopped at \n1kHz and focused between the 400\u00b5m gap of the emitter\u2019s strip-line electrodes, which were biased at 200V DC. The \npulsed THz radiation produced was collected, using reflection geometry [4], from the front face of the emitter and \nfocused onto the receiver using parabolic mirrors. Detection was then carried out using a delayed pulse, split from the \npump pulse, focused between bow-tie electrodes of 40\u00b5m gap size. \n \n2. THE PHASE DISTRIBUTION MODEL \n \nA scattering particle centred at r = (x,y,z) causes a change to both the amplitude a(\u03c1) and phase \u03c6(\u03c1), with co-ordinate  \n\u03c1 = (x,y), of an incident plane wave, over some surface z1 > z.  The amplitude of the forward propagating unscattered \nwave is given by  \nW\ndeaF i \u03c1\u03c1 \u03c1\u03d5\n2\n)()(\u222b= , \n \nwhere the integral extends over the area of the wave front W. When calculating the attenuation of the unscattered wave, \nthe spatial dependence of the field is not important, so the relevant information can be summarized by a phase \ndistribution function defined by \n.))(()()(\n2\n11 \u222b \u2212=\nW W\ndaP \u03c1\u03d5\u03c1\u03d5\u03b4\u03c1\u03d5  \n \nThe unscattered amplitude is then given by \n\u222b= ,)( 1 \u03d5\u03d5 \u03d5dePF i  \n \nwith the transmitted intensity through the scatterer being |F|2. \n \nIn this situation the distribution function becomes amenable to statistical treatment and the problem reduces to that of \nfinding suitable approximations for its calculation. The simplest approximation for the evaluation of \u03c6(\u03c1), for a non-\nabsorbing scatterer with refractive index n, is based on the direct projection of the optical density along the direction of \npropagation [5].  Evaluation of this is possible for any reasonably shaped scatterer, with a typical distribution being \nshown in Figure 1. By projecting the optical density of the slice onto the second surface, the phase change can be \ncalculated for a moderate range of refractive indices.  \n \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 6120  61200R-2\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 15 Nov 2010 to 129.234.252.66.

COMPARISONS WITH OTHER THEORIES \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 6120  61200R-3\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 15 Nov 2010 to 129.234.252.66. Terms of Use:  http:\/\/spiedl.org\/terms\n  \n \nThe Phase Distribution Model is being compared with other theories, to test its validity.  Mie theory [6] gives exact \nresults for scattering from isolated spheres and cylinders.  Comparison between the two theories shows that the model \ngives a good approximation if the refractive index is less than 2.  Figure 2 shows the predictions of Mie theory and the \nPhase Distribution Model for n=1.33.  \n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n3.5\n4\nsp\nhe\nre\n s\nca\ntte\nrin\ng \ncr\nos\ns \nse\nct\nio\nn\/\n(p\ni*a\n2 )\nMaximum phase f=2ak(n2-n1)\nMie theory for N=1.33 \nPhase distribution method -first approximation \n \nFigure 2: Normalised scattering cross section for spheres of refractive index 1.33 \n \nComparison between exact electromagnetic calculations and the Phase Distribution Model is also being undertaken. The \nexact calculations are being performed on two dimensional random arrays of dielectric cylinders, using a combination of \ntransfer matrix and multiple scattering techniques, implemented in the publicly available Pendry Code [7]. These \ncalculations proceed by numerically solving Maxwell\u2019s equations using a finite-element method. A mesh of points is \ndefined upon which the Maxwell equations are solved.  Boundary conditions are set on the external plane of points in the \nmesh, and a transfer matrix can be defined that propagates the electromagnetic field onto the next plane of points. Such a \nprocedure is iterated until the opposite external plane of points is reached. The transmission and reflection properties of \nthe structure are then derived from the total transfer matrix, as described in ref. [7]. \n \nCurrently good agreement is seen between the model and the exact calculations at long wavelengths. However, at short \nwavelengths the two results begin to diverge. Possible reasons for this may centre around the fact that the Phase \nDistribution Model calculates the transmitted field amplitude averaged over random scatterer positions: thus, the \nscattered amplitude averages to zero; but the forward wave amplitude does not.  Conversely, the exact calculations \ndetermine the amplitude for a particular arrangement of random scatterers, which contains contributions from both a \nbroad background of multiple-scattered waves and a superimposed peak from the unscattered waves. Further \ninvestigations into the discrepancies are currently in progress. \n \n4. COMPARISON WITH EXPERIMENT \n \nCurrently, transmission data from a number of scattering experiments is being compared with the Phase Distribution \nModel\u2019s predictions. Propagation of THz through random cylindrical and spherical scattering structures has been \ninvestigated, as have the attenuating properties of cloth. \n \n4.1 Spherical Scatterers \n \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 6120  61200R-4\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 15 Nov 2010 to 129.234.252.66.

The internal path lengths of the scatterers varied from 1.19mm to 20.64mm and \nencompassed a variation in the mean free path of a factor of 40. As noted in section 1 above, they have compared their \nresults with theories based on Mie theory and a quasi-crystalline approximation and found that neither of the two \ntreatments gives a satisfactory fit to the data. The Phase Distribution Model has been compared with this data and found \nto give a much closer fit to the measured signal attenuation.

These phantoms are made from the UV-curable resin Si-50, which has a refractive index of \nn=1.65\u00b10.05 in the range of 0.2 \u2013 3THz, using a stereolithographic process. The phantoms are of varying volume \nconcentration, ranging from 10% to 50%, each containing a number of randomly placed identical cylinders; the cylinder \ndiameter is varied from phantom to phantom, in the range of 0.4mm to 1.0mm, whilst their height is constant at 10mm. \nFigure 4 below shows a birds-eye view of one such phantom.  \n \n \n \nFigure 4:- Birds eye view of a cylindrical scattering structure. \nScatterer concentration 40%, cylinder diameter 1.0mm \n \nComparison of the experimental data with the PDM predictions is looking promising.

Figure 6 is the equivalent plot for \ncylinders of diameter 1mm and volume fraction 40%, the phantom structure shown in Figure 4. \n \nBoth sets of data have regions of high and low transmission in the frequency spectrum. The attenuation dips arise \nbecause of interference between directly propagating THz radiation, which has passed straight through the structure \nwithout taking part in a scattering event, and THz radiation which has been multiply scattered on passing through the \nphantom and has thus emerged at an angle equivalent to its incident angle.  Comparison of the experimental data with the \nPhase Distribution Model\u2019s predictions shows that areas of high and low absorption are expected. The expected \nfrequencies of these features are well matched between theory and experiment: for example 0.7THz in the 50% volume \nscatterer and 0.3THz for the 40% structure.

The yarns of the \ncloth are assumed to be uniform cylinders, made from fibres that are too small to be resolved in the THz regime. Once \nagain the projected optical density [5] is used for the phase change calculation. Figure 7 below shows the THz \nattenuation through a piece of cotton shirt, with effective refractive index n=1.29. The yarn diameters in the shirt are 180 \nmicrons, whilst the spacings are 330 microns and 250 microns for the warp and weft respectively. The THz absorption of \nthe shirt is seen to increase with frequency in good agreement with the model\u2019s prediction. Fits to other data [8] indicate \nthat the model is suitable for describing attenuation in a number of different fabrics, including cotton, polyester and \nterylene. \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 6120  61200R-7\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 15 Nov 2010 to 129.234.252.66.

PHASE DISTRIBTUION MODEL FOR SCATTERING \n \nThe Phase Distribution Model can be extended to describe the angular dependence of the scattered radiation. A \nknowledge of THz transmission through the random structure is required before this can be calculated. Within a random \nstructure the number of scattering events depends on its relative thickness and the mean free path of the radiation through \nthe structure. A short mean free path compared to sample thickness indicates that multiple scattering events will take \nplace implying diffusion of the radiation, whereas a long mean free path means that first ordering scattering will \ndominate throughout the volume. The optical projection method for determining the unscattered amplitude can be \nadapted for the scattering calculation. If the spatial variation of amplitude and phase over the second surface of a slice is \nknown, the amplitude of the forward scattered waves can be found by using the method of the angular spectrum of plane \nwaves [5]. It follows that the scattered intensities are related to the spatial correlation of the emerging field. For direct \nforward transmission this was found by the approximation method of projecting the optical density along the propagation \ndirection. For scattering, it appears to be an appropriate approximation to project the optical density along a direction \nintermediate between the incident and scattered directions. \n \nIn order to test this idea, calculations have been performed of the scattering by a dielectric cylinder, and the results \ncompared with the exact solutions of the wave equation. Figure 8 shows that satisfactory agreement is obtained for a \nmoderate range of refractive indices (n < 2), which supports the use of this approximation for more complicated \nstructures that are not amenable to exact calculation. \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 6120  61200R-8\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 15 Nov 2010 to 129.234.252.66.

CONCLUSIONS \n \nThe Phase Distribution Model has been found to provide a good description of the propagation of waves through random \nmedia. Comparison with exact theory has shown that the model provides a suitable description of the expected scattering \nfrom isolated cylinders and spheres over a range of refractive indices (n < 2). Experimental tests of the model have also \nindicated that it describes the forward propagating THz attenuation in random structures of varying volume \nconcentrations and scatterer size, as well as providing a good description of the THz attenuation through regularly \narranged fabrics. Early indications are also promising for the model\u2019s ability to describe the scattering of THz radiation \nfrom randomly arranged structures. \n \nREFERENCES \n \n1. Z. Jian, J. Pearce and D.M.
