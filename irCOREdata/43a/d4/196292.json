Instead of \u2018overcoming\u2019 the Cartesian dualisms, both authors find a way to \nmediate between the dualistic concepts by introducing a third concept. In Leibniz\u2019 case, \nthis is God, in Bourdieu\u2019s case, history. Reading Bourdieu thus from a Leibnizian angle, \nthe note seeks to clarify some issues in Bourdieu\u2019s theory construction.   \n \nKeywords: Bourdieu, Descartes, dualisms, Leibniz \n \nAuthor :  \nElke Weik \n \nUniversity of Leicester \nSchool of Management \nLeicester LE1 7RH \nUK \n \nphone: 0044-116-252 5318 \nemail: e.weik@le.ac.uk \n \n 2 \nThe present research note wants to show linkages and similarities in theory construction \nbetween Bourdieu and the 17\nth\n century philosopher Leibniz. The aim is to explore to \nwhich extent Bourdieu (most explicitly stated  in Bourdieu, 1980\/1990, Bourdieu and \nWacquant, 1996) overcomes the traditional dualisms formed by Cartesian philosophy: \nsubjective-objective, mind-body as well as the subsequently developed dichotomy of \nstructure and agency\n1\n.  \n \nAmong the many concepts Bourdieu introduces for that purpose, I should like to focus \non the special relationship of two: the habitus and the field. The habitus is Bourdieu\u2019s \nmajor concept to portray how institutions, conventions and other practices influence and \nshape the individual human being with regard to its body, preferences, attitudes, etc. \nThrough socialisation and biography, the habitus attains a historical dimension. Its \nhysteresis guarantees a certain stability as it retains the habitus malleable but only \n\u2018reluctantly\u201d and in a slow process of re-socialisation (Bourdieu and Wacquant, 1996). \nThe field, on the other hand, is the dynamic situation actors live in. The spatial \nmetaphor of the field points to Bourdieu\u2019s emphasis on relations and positions. It is \nshaped by actors\u2019 practices, and has also a strong historical dimension in the process of \nobjectification as individual actions become objective conditions. In sum, both the \nhabitus and the field function as \u2018depositories\u2019 for past practices, and both objectify \nthese practices: the habitus in a corporal, the field in a social way. Under conditions of \nstability, i.e. when the present is like the past, the habitus enables people to \u2018inhabit\u2019 the \ninstitutions of the field. Vice versa, to the degree that the present differs from the past, \nthe habitus and the field may develop a conflictual relationship. The remarkable feature \nin Bourdieu\u2019s linking of the habitus and the field is the way these two do not interact \n 3 \ndirectly. The habitus is formed over time and then normally remains stable (cum grano \nsalis) afterwards, and the same can be said of the institutions of the field. If we take a \nsnapshot of an adult person at a certain time, both the habitus and the field are given in a \nrather static way. Their primary connection is through the past, i.e. a common history \nthat increases the probability of their matching in the present. In the present, to repeat, \nthere can be no ad hoc adjustment, or as Bourdieu puts it: \n\u2018The proper object of social sciences, then, is [\u2026] the relations between two realizations \nof historical action, in bodies and in things\u2019 (Bourdieu and Wacquant, 1996:126f.). \n \nAnd later: \n\u2018Social reality exists, so to speak, twice, in things and in minds, in fields and in habitus, \noutside and inside of agents\u2019 (Bourdieu and Wacquant, 1996:127). \n \nI find this theoretical twist quite remarkable. It is, to my knowledge, unique in social \ntheory as far as the relation between structure and agency is concerned. Giddens (1992, \n1984\/1993), for example, envisages skilled actors to choose and modify institutions. \nLuhmann (1985\/1995) has agents build institutions from reciprocal expectations \nconfirmed by respective actions. Structuralism (Durkheim, 1965, L\u00e9vi-Strauss, 1977) \nassumes mental structures to shape agency. In each of these cases the assumption is that \nstructure influences agency and\/or vice versa. In contrast, Bourdieu\u2019s solution \u2013 take \ntwo dichotomous entities that are commonly perceived to interact, deny their immediate \ncausal relation, and introduce a common third to which they are causally related \u2013 \nresembles a special group of theories in early modern rationalist philosophy connected \nwith the names of Malebranche, Geulincx and Leibniz. Quite tellingly, these \n 4 \nphilosophers set out to counter some of Descartes\u2019 dualist claims \u2013 as Bourdieu seeks to \ndo. I believe it is worthwhile pursuing this thread because it can shed light from a new \nangle on how Bourdieu seeks to overcome the structure-agency dualism.  \n \nThe presence of Leibniz in Bourdieu\u2019s works \n \nNot much attention is paid to the influence of Leibniz in the English secondary \nliterature on Bourdieu. Most books describe Bourdieu\u2019s concepts of habitus and field \nwithout any reference to the philosopher. In the same way, many enumerations of \nBourdieu\u2019s intellectual sources (e.g. Harker et al., 1990) do not mention Leibniz at all. \nExceptions to this are Robbins\u2019s more recent works on Bourdieu (Robbins, 2000, 2006) \nand an anthology on the philosophical contribution of Bourdieu by Shusterman (1999). \nRobbins (2000), in a small passage towards the end, places Bourdieu in the rationalist \ntradition of Leibniz that celebrates the randomness of plurality and the multiplicity of \npossible worlds and rejects Cartesian dualisms. In Shusterman\u2019s anthology, Bouveresse \n(1999) describes how Leibniz links the habitus of agents to their dispositions, and how \nLeibniz distinguishes between spontaneous and free actions. For Leibniz, habitus is the \ntechnical term for describing the fact that something happens because the agent has a \ndisposition to make it happen, in which case the agent can be said to have a habitus for \nthat something. For him, the behaviour of an agent is the product of the habitus. \nNevertheless, he says, this behaviour can be spontaneous because he defines \n\u2018spontaneous\u2019 as the principle of the action lying within the agent. Spontaneous \nbehaviour can moreover be free if the action is preceded by an act of deliberation. In \nthat sense, animals can act spontaneously but not freely, and in the same sense actions \n 5 \nthat result from the habitus are spontaneous but not free. The parallels to Bourdieu\u2019s \nnotion of the habitus are quite striking. In the same anthology, Pinto (1999) shows how \nthe notion of the habitus as an acquired possession marked with time can be traced back \nto Leibniz\u2019s critique of Cartesian mechanism. While Descartes held that movement was \na succession of points observed by someone, Leibniz emphasised the internal qualities \nof movement, i.e. the fact that it was determined by previous movements and future \nstates and that it contained a dynamic principle (the energy) that caused the movement. \nFinally, the most comprehensive discussion of Leibniz\u2019s influence on Bourdieu can be \nfound in Robbins\u2019s most recent work (Robbins, 2006). The author himself admits that it \ntook him until 1997 to understand the importance of Leibniz for Bourdieu\u2019s thought.   \nAnd although he discusses the philosopher mostly in a summary way relating to his \noverall impact on Bourdieu, Robbins leaves no doubt as to Leibniz\u2019s significance. \nWhere Robbins goes into more detail, he discusses the philosopher\u2019s distinction \nbetween necessary and contingent propositions, his views on the role of mathematics or \nLeibniz\u2019s attempt to reconcile finalism and mechanism. In sum, however, it might be \nsaid that Leibniz does not figure prominently in the English secondary literature on \nBourdieu and is not referred to regarding the issue I want to talk about, viz. the link \nbetween habitus and field. \n \nBourdieu himself refers to Leibniz on several occasions and in various regards. Scholars \nfamiliar with Bourdieu\u2019s biography will remember that he wrote his postgraduate thesis \non one of Leibniz\u2019s works, the Animadversiones. In his major books, he refers to \nLeibniz on recurrent themes: one is his concept of \u2018symbolic evidence\u2019 (evidentia ex \nterminis) (Bourdieu, 1990:83, 1980\/1990:68f., 1984\/1993:29, Bourdieu and Wacquant, \n 6 \n1996:223), another his conviction that men mostly act without conscious thought \n(Bourdieu, 1980\/1990:68f., 1997\/2000:162, Bourdieu and Wacquant, 1996:131). The \nthird and most pertinent to my topic is Leibniz\u2019s clock metaphor  (Bourdieu, 1990:302, \n1980\/1990:59f.) in which he takes the example of two clocks running in sync with each \nother. Their continuous synchronisation can be achieved in three ways: first, by the \nwatchmaker constantly correcting every deviation, second, by linking them \nmechanically, and third, by constructing them in such a way that their continuing \nsynchronisation is guaranteed. Finally, there is his claim that events produce themselves \nwith a certain probability even in the absence of strategic players (Leibniz\u2019s pretentio \nad existendum) (Bourdieu, 1997\/2000:215). We will discuss the latter two in more \ndepth below. \n \nDescartes and his dualisms \n \nStarting from a position of universal doubt, Descartes (1644\/1983) concluded that \neverything could be doubted except the existence of the one consciousness that \nharboured the doubts \u2013 this is the famous \u2018cogito ergo sum\u2019. From this he inferred that \nthere must be one ontological substance which he called \u2018res cogitans\u2019, i.e. thinking or \nconsciousness\n2\n. This res was immaterial. A couple of other deductions then led him to \nthe conclusion that there was a second substance: \u2018res extensa\u2019, i.e. extension or matter. \nOntologically speaking, the two were dichotomous, i.e. every entity in the universe \nbelonged either to the one or the other group of res \u2013 this led to the mind-matter \ndualism. Epistemologically speaking, it was clear for Descartes that a consciousness \nnever perceived pure matter but colours, sounds, etc., which were not qualities of the \n 7 \nmatter but something produced or added by the perceiver\n3\n. In this sense, perception of \nmaterial objects was \u2018distorted\u2019 \u2013 this led to the subject-object dualism.  \n \nDescartes encountered immediate problems with his dualist ontology when he was \nforced to explain how, in human beings, an immaterial intention or decision could lead \nto a bodily movement, e.g. raising one\u2019s arm. How could the res cogitans and the res \nextensa be causally related? Descartes resorted to \u2018spirits\u2019 moving in the nervous system \nand being directed by the pineal gland, which in turn could be affected by the soul, but \neven contemporaries found the explanation not very convincing as it was still unclear \nhow the soul (a res cogitans) could affect the pineal gland (a res extensa).  \n \nDescartes\u2019 Critics \n \nAmong the many critiques of the Cartesian ontology, three were to have a lasting \nimpact on philosophy (Anon., 2002, R\u00f6d, 1978, 1984, Russell, 1946\/1995):  \n Spinoza theorised that both res extensa and res cogitans were part of the only truly \nexisting substance, which was God. This led to a pantheistic, panpsychistic view of \nthe world, in which God inhabited everything and could thus mediate between mind \nand matter. \n Malebranche and other so-called \u2018Occasionalists\u2019 kept the dichotomy, but stipulated \nthat God interfered each time mind and matter were supposed to interact. Thus, for \nexample, if I decided to lift my arm, God would notice this and make my arm rise \nshortly after I had made the decision.  \n 8 \n Leibniz, finally, took a similar stance as Malebranche, but thought it quite \nunprofessional for the Creator to intervene in every single instant. So Leibniz \nproposed that God \u2013 obviously a perfect mathematician - had created the world in a \nway that every mind and every object followed their pre-ordained paths, which were \nadjusted to each other. Thus the trajectory of my mind would determine that I took \nthe decision to lift my arm at one particular point in my life, and moments after my \nbody, following its trajectory, would act in a way that appeared to be causal, but in \nreality was not. This is Leibniz\u2019 notion of \u2018pre-established harmony\u2019. In comparison \nwith Descartes, Leibniz (1714\/1998) thus views res cogitans and res extensa as \nparallels that do not interact at all. It is only through God that they have a mediated \nrelationship.  \n \nWe can see that the three positions mirror the three options in Leibniz\u2019s clock metaphor \nthat I introduced above. Translated into contemporary theories, Bourdieu (Bourdieu, \n1980\/1990:302) identifies Malebranche\u2019s solution of continuous creation with the \nreproduction of the field by means that are not immanent to the field, for example the \nfree will of agents, which acts as a \u2018deus ex machina\u2019 as far as social order is concerned. \nSpinoza\u2019s view might be likened to idealist conceptions of a collective spirit permeating \nthe actors and the field. Bourdieu\u2019s solution, finally is that of Leibniz in so far as the \nhabitus of the individual actors are in a pre-established (i.e. established long before the \npoint of observation) harmony with the field. \n \nLeibniz, however, modifies Descartes\u2019 system even further. Descartes had based his \nphysics on geometry. Leibniz, in contrast, believes that physical extension is different \n 9 \nfrom geometrical extension as a point in physics has an extension, however small, while \na geometrical point has not. Instead, Leibniz seeks to base his physics on the notion of \nforce implying that every physical occurrence can be traced back to a force. This relates \nto the pretentio ad existendum introduced above. The force that creates an object lies in \nthe subject that perceives\n4\n it. To Leibniz, the subject does not create representations of \nthe object in its mind, but creates the object itself. It does this by unifying a manifold of \nperceptions into one object. Thus the object\u2019s existence depends entirely on the subject. \nThis subject - the Cartesian res cogitans - he calls \u2018monad\u2019. In consequence, the subject \ngives structure to the world it perceives, and it is only the subject (and God, of course) \nthat has the force to bring change about. It also changes itself with every perception it \nhas. The force in the subject is called entelechy, the old Aristotelian term for the \nteleological striving of an organism. Forces in physics are then a derivative of this \noriginal force. This makes sense, because Leibniz believes that we could not have the \nidea of a force in objects if we did not have or feel a similar force in us. Finally, as \nevery monad perceives the world in total, it is a microcosm in itself. However, as each \nperceives the world from a different angle, each microcosm is different. This is Leibniz\u2019 \nrelativist epistemology. \n \nLeibniz and Bourdieu \n \nAlthough Bourdieu mentions Leibniz explicitly in a number of places, I believe \nLeibniz\u2019s influence to be much more pervasive than the explicit references would \nsuggest. In order to show how close both systems are, I have collated a selection of \nquotes from Bourdieu in table 1. \n 10 \n \nINSERT TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE \n \nWhile I do not claim that Bourdieu has developed these notions under the exclusive \ninfluence of Leibniz, I think the parallels in the theoretical arrangement quite \ninteresting. With Leibniz as a theoretical foil, it is possible to argue for a theoretical \nconstruct (the habitus) that is at the same time individual, i.e. particular and different \nfrom every other, as well as modifiable through experiences, but also general in the \nsense of relating to a common field. As Leibniz\u2019s monads have their individual \nentelechies and trajectories, as they are modified by every perception they integrate, so \nBourdieu\u2019s individual habitus are unique and modifiable. As Leibniz\u2019s monads are co-\nordinated through the force (God) that originally created them, so Bourdieu\u2019s habitus \nare integrated by a common history that originally created them. The difference between \nboth authors lies in the creating force and its qualities; for Leibniz it is an omniscient \nGod, for Bourdieu it is history \u2013 a less perfect watchmaker - which may have its \ndiscontinuities and thus produce habitus that are ill-suited to meet the requirements of \nthe present. \n \nThe field, on the other hand, is pure relationality. It does not consist of objects that are \nthen, in a second step, related to each other. Rather, the field is these relations, and the \nrelations then constitute objects. Bourdieu (see table 1) repeatedly emphasises this idea. \nThe agentic structure that bundles relations into objects is, in Leibniz\u2019s terms, the \nmonad. In opposition to the Cartesian ego that first is and then perceives, the monad is \nbecause it perceives. It constitutes itself in the act of perceiving. This is the important \n 11 \nprerequisite for overcoming the traditional subject-object dualism, for the monad only \nbecomes (a subject) when it relates to objects. And it is only in this moment that the \nobjects become objects because the monad construes them as such. Finally, Leibniz\u2019s \nnotion of the force within each monad (entelechy) plays an important role when it \ncomes to conceptualising the field as something that evolves even without the input of \nstrategic agents. The social world, as Bourdieu (1980\/1990:54) stresses, has a history \nand as such an internal dynamic. \n \nDoes it matter? I believe indeed that the study of Leibniz can clarify some issues in \nBourdieu\u2019s work and may be helpful to deflect some of the critique directed against \nhim. I should like to substantiate my claim by taking a closer look at two authors who \ncriticise Bourdieu\u2019s habitus for leading into structuralist determinism. My first example \nis Anthony King, who accuses Bourdieu of \u2018relapsing into objectivism\u2019 with the concept \nof the habitus:  \n\u2018Individuals automatically live out an objective social destiny as a result of the \nhabitus. [\u2026] for the habitus ensures that the individual will inevitably act according \nto the logic of the situation.\u2019 (King, 2000:423) And later: \u2018If every individual is \nconstrained by his habitus, then the objective conditions will simply be reproduced \n(by the habitus) and no social change will take place.\u2019 (King, 2000:428) \n \nIn the light of our preceding discussion of Leibniz, I think King fails to see that the \nhabitus is not a structure in an essentialist sense, but a generative mechanism or a \ncreative force that produces things instead of merely reproducing them. The idea of an \nentelechy is, in fact, quite the opposite of a reproductive capacity. It is a force following \n 12 \nan individual trajectory determined by individual occasions. It is something that moves \nor progresses. It is not a simple representation of an objective social destiny \u2018inside\u2019 an \nindividual\u2019s head (that would be the Cartesian solution) that serves as a blueprint for \nidentical future actions. From what I have explained about the monad and its relation to \nthe world, we can see that the habitus is the objective social destiny subjectivised. It is \u2013 \nwhich is the same in a Leibnizian perspective - the relation between the individual and \nthe objective social destiny. And it \u2013 again the same \u2013 only becomes objective social \ndestiny because it is construed as such. King\u2019s mistake, I believe, is to remain in the \ntraditional structure-agency dualism in which structure is retentive and only agency is \nactive and can bring about change. This opposition basically follows Descartes \ndichotomy between passive matter and active mind. However, this is not how Leibniz \nsees it, and I hence I believe it is not how Bourdieu sees it. The monad is structure, or \nconfiguration, because in a relational philosophy every being is a structured bundle of \nrelations. Yet, at the same time, monads are the only agents in the universe. They are \nstructured agents or an agentive structure. And I believe this is what Bourdieu has in \nmind for his habitus. \nLeibniz\u2019s explication may also have helped Richard Jenkins (1992:79), who talks of a \n\u2018characteristically elliptical and opaque formulation\u2019 and accuses Bourdieu of offering \nthree different views of the habitus:  \n\u2018... that the habitus is \u2018the site of the internalization of reality and the externalization \nof internality.\u2019 Elsewhere he talks about \u2018the dialectical relationship between the \nobjective structures and the cognitive and motivating structures which they produce \nand which tend to reproduce them\u2019. Elsewhere again, we read that the habitus is \n\u2018objectively adjusted to the particular conditions in which it is constituted\u2019, or that \n 13 \n\u2018The conditioning is associated with a particular class of conditions of existence \nproduce habitus.\u2019 So, we have at least three different views: objective conditions \nproduce the habitus, the habitus is adjusted to objective conditions, and there is a \nreciprocal or dialectical relationship between them.\u2019 \n \nIndeed, following Leibniz, as I have explained above, it is possible to say that the \nhabitus is produced by and adjusted to and dialectical vis-\u00e0-vis the field. It is \u2013 akin to \nArcher\u2019s (1995) solution \u2013 time that does the trick because these three views are \nsnapshots, so to speak, of the habitus-field relation at different moments in time. This is \nthe nature of a mediated dualism as introduced by Leibniz.  \n \nOvercoming Dualisms? \n \nAs indicated above, a number of dichotomies come into play in social theory, and they \nare linked through their Cartesian heritage. In Bourdieu\u2019s work, the dichotomy of mind \n(symbol) and matter is conceptually retained, i.e. mind and matter remain distinct \nconcepts. However, Bourdieu notes that every object is of a dual nature, i.e. has \nsymbolic and material characteristics. Social reality exists in things and minds (see the \nquotation in table 1). Like Leibniz, he does not seek to circumvent or abolish the \ndichotomy. His theory of practice shows that both modes, the symbolic and the \nmaterial, language and the body, always go together: Institutions are initially founded \non symbolic distinctions, but these distinctions become naturalised in the habitus. Body \nand language function as depositories of thought. Practical belief, which ties the habitus \nto a particular field, is for the most part pre-reflexive bodily behaviour and only to a \n 14 \nsmall extent conscious sense-making. These examples show that although Bourdieu\u2019s \nnotions of habitus and practice are explicitly designed to redirect attention from a \nsymbolic-cognitive perspective of society towards a material and pre-reflexive one, the \nmaterial aspect never substitutes the symbolic one nor are they fused in a novel \ntheoretical concept. Bourdieu breaks with the traditional emphasis, not with the \ndistinction itself. \n \nOf all dichotomies, the subject-object dichotomy is perhaps the one that Bourdieu has \ndirected his attention to most explicitly. He develops his \u201dtheory of practice\u2019 with the \nstated aim (Bourdieu, 1980\/1990) to overcome it. His practical world is a teleological \none, where objects are construed rather than observed. The construction is achieved by \nthe subject based on its habitus. The habitus, in turn, is a structure that reflects the \nstructure of the individual\u2019s environment in the past. The structural as well as the \nteleological and the constructivist emphasis are reminiscent of Leibniz\u2019 system. The \nsubject becomes the dominant pole in perception, but \u2018carries the world within\u2019. It thus \ncombines traditionally subjective (teleology, construction) and traditionally objective \n(structure) aspects. \n \nThe structure-agency debate, finally, is partly tied to his subjective-objective solution. \nAs I have tried to show in the preceding section, Leibniz\u2019s influence on Bourdieu is \nperhaps most visible here because of the unique nature of his theoretical solution. On \nthe conceptual level of the construction of the habitus, the relational ontology leaves \nBourdieu free to conceptualise structure as agentic. On the macro level of the interplay \nbetween field and habitus, he can use Leibniz\u2019s mediated dualism to construe, on the \n 15 \none hand, how the habitus is shaped by the field, but how, on the other hand, they retain \na dialectical relationship with one another. The key to dissolve the contradiction in this \nis time or history as, roughly speaking, the shaping happens at a different time, i.e. \nearlier, than the interaction in the field. This is the idea of pre-established harmony \u2013 \nwith the caveat that in using this term we have to ignore all the normative connotations \nthat go with it like happiness, peacefulness or perfection. Let us remember that Leibniz \nwas also a mathematician, and his \u2018best of all possible worlds\u201d is the result of an \noptimisation in which \u2018best\u2019 does not presuppose \u2018good\u2019 in any way. Summing up, \nBourdieu overcomes this dualism in his construction of the habitus, but he retains it in \nthe dialectical opposition between field and habitus. As I stated at the beginning, I think \nthis mediated dualism is quite an intriguing solution. \n \nConclusion \n \nReading Bourdieu from a Leibnizian perspective can, I believe, offer a better \nunderstanding of Bourdieu\u2019s theory construction and major concepts. I still do not hold \nthat Leibniz constituted the major influence on his works \u2013 this is why this is a research \nnote and not a book. However, I hope to have shown that Leibniz helps in \nunderstanding how Bourdieu tackles the dichotomies he aims at overcoming. Moreover, \nsome of the critique directed against the habitus and Bourdieu\u2019s apparent structuralism \nor determinism seems to be situated in a Cartesian worldview that Leibniz has rejected \nquite explicitly. \n \n \n 16 \nReferences \n \nAnon.
