It had been\nfounded at the high point of optimism about the effectiveness of collective\nsocial provision and it died when the prognosis for collective social action\nin Britain reached its nadir. The majority of members present at the\nAnnual General Meeting of the Association felt, presumably, that a\nchange of title might help turn the tide of history. Social policy sounds\nless dreary, more political, than social administration. The Journal is,\nafter all, called the Journal of Social Policy. What makes the change rather\nmore than a pointless gesture, I believe, is that the change actually\nsymbolises what has been a major failing of social administration as an\narea of study. It has not been concerned with the administration of social\ninstitutions. Administration was not the proper concern of university\nteachers, far too low level, untheoretical and boring. It is certainly not\nsomething likely to get you notice and acclaim amongst one's colleagues\nand superiors on whom promotion depends. We could have called it\n'welfare management' and attained respectability and fashionability too.\nBut no, that carried implications of efficiency and cost cutting. That\nwould never do. We studied the policymaking process, the clashes of\nideology inherent in opposing views about the role of the state, the crisis\nin the Welfare State, the newest and most obscure Marxist inter-\npretations, the applications of economic, political and social theory.\nOthers in the older tradition continued to investigate the poor and the\ndeprived, to draw attention to the inadequacies and inequities of the\nmarket. Market failures and equity arguments continued to be used to\njustify collective public provision.\nYet nowhere, or almost nowhere, did scholars take time to analyse in\ndepth or theorise about how welfare bureaucracies actually worked at\nthe local level. David Donnison (1963) had done so. Few followed (David\nBillis, 1984). Yet in the end social services have lost public support not\nbecause we failed to make the equity case with sufficient conviction and\nt Professor of Social Administration, Department of Social Science and Administration, London\nSchool of Economics.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 14 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\n84 Howard Glennerster\neloquence, or reveal depths of poverty with sufficient rigour in the pages\nof the Journal of Social Policy but above all because ordinary people's\nexperiences of the services have often been demeaning and downright\ninefficient.\nIt is not enough to say that this is because the consumers are poor and\nthis side of a socialist Utopia you can't do better. I spent part of this\nsummer walking up and down filthy blocks of flats in different parts of the\ncountry with rubbish shutes that don't work; lifts full of garbage; racist\ngraffiti on walls of Bangladeshi homes. Many tenants live on estates\nwhere nothing works or ever seems likely to work. It is difficult, then, not\nto ask fundamental questions about the nature of the bureaucratic\nincentives which make this a way of life.\nThe economists have an answer. Public choice theory argues that\nsocial service consumers can exercise no power of' exit' and tha t ' voice'\n(tenants'participation) (Hirschman, 1970) is incapable of producing a\nreal incentive for efficiency. Public servants merely maximise their own\nself interest (Niskanen, 1971). These new right attacks on public\nbureaucracies have force partly because they strike home but, also,\nbecause there is no coherent alternative view about what makes public\nbureaucracies work or could make them work better. That is our fault.\nIf we had worried less about critical theory and more about cleaning\npeople's rubbish we would have served humanity better.\nThat is not to say that social administrators should run courses in\nwaste disposal, but it does mean we should devote more thought to\nunderstanding the nature of public sector and non-profit organisations.\nHow do we provide appropriate structures to respond to consumers'\ndemands, and ration scarce resources in ways that reflect political and\nprofessional preferences too? How do we maintain the motivation for\nefficiency in the absence of profit or the test of competition\n ? It is our\nfailure to grapple successfully with these issues, I believe, that will\ncondemn our subject area. The retreat from social administration is not\na hopeful sign. Is it not social policy and administration we should be\nstudying ?\nR E F E R E N C E S\nD. Billis (1984), Welfare Bureaucracies, Heinemann, London.\nD.V. Donnison et al.
