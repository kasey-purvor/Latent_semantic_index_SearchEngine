However, the processability of those materials is rather poor which\nimpedes their practical application. In particular, their solubility in most organic solvents\nand water is too low. An intensive research effort has been initiated aimed at the\ndevelopment of highly soluble and easily processible polythiophenes including, for\nexample, alkylsulfanyl groups4 to render the polymer soluble in organic solvents or\ncarboxylic2 or sulphonic5 acids to confer water solubility. Despite the progress achieved\nin these studies, the yield of polythiophenes is often low and the process itself can be\nexpensive and demand the use of aggressive and toxic solvents.\nWe report here on the photopolymerization of some substituted thiophenes, 3-\nthiophene acetic acid (TAA) , boronic acid (TBA) and carboxylic acid (TCA), catalyzed\nby potassium dichromate. This reaction can be performed under mild conditions in an\naqueous environment and using irradiation with visible light. The process leads to a high\nyield of oligomers (4-7mers), which are soluble in THF and the simultaneous deposition\nof insoluble polymer on the illuminated surface. Previous work within this department\nhas shown the suitability of this process for making molecularly imprinted films for use\nin assays.7 A typical polymerization, that of TCA was performed as follows: 10 mmol of\n3-thiophenecarboxylic acid were dissolved in 50 ml of deionized water and mixed with\n50 ml of 30 mmol aqueous potassium dichromate. The solution was exposed to visible\nlight (100 W) for 3 days. During the steady state irradiation with visible light, the\nsolution became brown in colour, forming a dark brown precipitate and coating on the\nilluminated container surface. This was not observed when reactions were carried out in\nthe dark, or when potassium dichromate was replaced by copper(II) chloride, ferric\nchloride, potassium permanganate or ammonium persulphate. The resulting suspension\nwas evaporated and the brown residue washed extensively with water to remove non-\nreacted monomer and potassium dichromate. After drying the oligomers were extracted\nwith refluxing THF. The yield of the oligomeric derivatives was 85%. The same reaction\nwas performed in polystyrene cuvettes (10x10x45 mm3, Sarstedt, Germany) which were\nused for measuring the UV-vis absorbance of the deposited film or in polycarbonate Petri\ndishes. Similar behaviour was found when TAA or TBA were used as the monomers.\nElemental analysis of the soluble fraction of polythiophene carboxylic acid gave:\nC \u2013 37.7%; H \u2013 2.8%; S \u2013 16.4%; Cr \u2013 12.8%; K \u2013 0.5%. The lower value of S\/C ratio\n(0.44) compared to theoretical one (0.53) is due to bond breaking of thiophene rings.6\nUnfortunately it proved impossible to remove the chromium contaminant (Cr2O3).\nVarious methods were attempted, but only the most drastic such as hot alkaline\npersulphate solution removed Cr. However, this also appeared to affect the polymer\ncomposition, probably due to further oxidation.\nGPC analysis of the product soluble in THF indicated formation of oligomers and\npolymer, the largest fraction (78%) having molecular weight 0.6x103 (vs. PST),\ncorresponding to the 4-5mer, with 20% having molecular weight 0.8x103 (vs. PST),\ncorresponding to the 6-7mer, but with small peaks indicating higher molecular weight\nspecies of up to 2.5x103 (vs. PST). The results are similar to those for polymers obtained\nfrom UV light induced photodeposition performed using an excimer laser.6\nMass spectrometry measured of the soluble polymer gave peaks at 90, 155; 242;\n289; 421; 460; 613; 766; 863; 919; 1073; 1190; 1340; 1425; 1495; 1574; 2129;\n2518. MALDI experiments performed on the insoluble polymer showed masses peaking\nat about 1000 for PTCA and 1500 for PTBA. However MALDI may only be removing\nlower molecular weight fragments from the polymer mixture. The peaks were regularly\nspaced at intervals of 44, indicating that either carboxylate or boronic sidegroups were\nbeing removed under the conditions used to obtain the spectra.\nFT-IR measurements of the product showed adsorption bands specific to \uf061-\ncoupled polythiophene. IR (cm-1): 3125, 1705, 1610, 1570, 1530, 1440, 1360, 940, 880,\n840, 760, 710, 670, 630, 540. Broad peak between 3200-3700 cm-1 is characteristic for\nHO absorption of carboxylic function and the peak at 1075 characteristic of a carbonyl\nstretch. Those results clearly confirm that the carboxylic function withstood the applied\noxidation conditions and remains in the resulting polymer. IR spectra of the monomers\nshowed sharp peaks at about 3150 (TCA) and 3480 (TBA) corresponding to the C-H\nstretch, these were much reduced in the polymeric product, indicating loss of those bonds\ndue to polymerization.\nThe UV-vis spectrum (Fig. 1) of PTCA in DMF solutions displays adsorption\nmaxima at 425 and 585 nm, indicating that the polymer probably exists as mixture of two\nforms with different level of conjugation.4 The UV spectrum of the solid form deposited\non the inside of a polystyrene cuvette showed a different spectrum with higher adsorption\nat longer wavelengths.\nEllipsometry studies and fitting of the data obtained showed that the PTCA film\nused for the UV measurements had a thickness of 0.59 \uf06dm with a roughness of 6.4 nm.\nThe film had a refractive index of 1.63 at 800 nm, increasing gradually to 1.65 at 500 nm,\n1.68 at 400 nm and 1.85 at 300 nm.\nAFM and SEM studies were performed on films deposited onto polystyrene and\nshow flat films with some granular structure (Fig 2a). In an attempt to determine typical\nthicknesses, a film of PTCA was photodeposited onto a polycarbonate surface, the\nsubstrate was broken and analyzed using SEM; these images are shown in Figure 2. The\nfilm shows a cracked appearance and the cross-section pictures (Fig. 2b) give a thickness\nof 1-2 \uf06dm. Energy Dispersive Spectrography (EDS) analysis gave a surface composition\nindicating lower levels of Cr composition as compared to the soluble fraction (S:Cr\natomic ratio about 4:1).\nA possible mechanism of the reaction is as follows. Due to the nucleophilic\ncharacter of the -COOH group, 3-thiophenecarboxylic acid can not be polymerized using\na traditional approach such as when FeCl3 is used as oxidizing agent. In some cases\npolymerization of acidic derivatives was performed using a two step procedure involving\nfirst protection of the acid with benzyl group.1 For the polymerization reaction to occur,\nthree things must be present: monomer, dichromate ion and light. No reaction was\nobserved when monomer and dichromate solutions were combined and stored in the dark\nand the reaction was not seen to occur when potassium dichromate was replaced by other\noxidants. Dichromate ion has been shown to be catalytically active in a series of\nphotochemical reactions. A complex of Cr(VI)-TCA3 was shown to catalyse the\nphotopolymerization (440 nm) of methyl methacrylate in DMF.8 No presence of\ncomplexation between Cr2O72- and TCA however can be detected spectrophotometrically\nin the absence of illumination, which is in agreement with previous finding.9 According\nto the suggested mechanism of photochemical polymerization, the complex between\nmonomer and Cr(VI), formed by photocomplexation undergoes a charge-transfer reaction\nleading after a charge separation to Cr(V) and an organic radical.9 Cr(V) oxidizes the\nstarting material, by a spin-pairing of two radical cations to form a dihydro-dimer\ndication, which subsequently undergoes a loss of protons and rearomatization8,10.\nCoupling occurs at the position of highest unpaired-electron spin density. The\npolymerization continues with the oxidation of the dimer which undergoes further\ncoupling reaction with other radical cations. The final photoproducts are Cr2O3 and poly-\nTCA.\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated a novel polymerization method for \uf061-linked\noligo- and polythiophenes. The present photochemical polymerization method provides a\nbasis for coating a surface with layers of new functional materials 0.5-2 \uf06dm thick and is\npotentially very useful for use in microelectronics and sensors.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to acknowledge Prof. C.
