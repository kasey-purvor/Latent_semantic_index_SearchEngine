Faragher and Andrew M. Fry*\nDepartment of Biochemistry, University of Leicester, Leicester LE1 7RH, United Kingdom\nSubmitted February 25, 2003; Revised March 21, 2003; Accepted March 24, 2003\nMonitoring Editor: Trisha Davis\nNek2A is a cell cycle-regulated kinase of the never in mitosis A (NIMA) family that is highly\nenriched at the centrosome. One model for Nek2A function proposes that it regulates cohesion\nbetween the mother and daughter centriole through phosphorylation of C-Nap1, a large coiled-\ncoil protein that localizes to centriolar ends. Phosphorylation of C-Nap1 at the G2\/M transition\nmay trigger its displacement from centrioles, promoting their separation and subsequent bipolar\nspindle formation. To test this model, we generated tetracycline-inducible cell lines overexpress-\ning wild-type and kinase-dead versions of Nek2A. Live cell imaging revealed that active Nek2A\nstimulates the sustained splitting of interphase centrioles indicative of loss of cohesion. However,\nthis splitting is accompanied by only a partial reduction in centriolar C-Nap1. Strikingly, induc-\ntion of kinase-dead Nek2A led to formation of monopolar spindles with unseparated spindle\npoles that lack C-Nap1. Furthermore, kinase-dead Nek2A interfered with chromosome segrega-\ntion and cytokinesis and led to an overall change in the DNA content of the cell population. These\nresults provide the first direct evidence in human cells that Nek2A function is required for the\ncorrect execution of mitosis, most likely through promotion of centrosome disjunction. However,\nthey suggest that loss of centriole cohesion and C-Nap1 displacement may be distinct mitotic\nevents.\nINTRODUCTION\nA centrosome is classically depicted as having two orthog-\nonally positioned cylindrical centrioles surrounded by a ma-\ntrix of fibrous and globular proteins that constitute the peri-\ncentriolar material (PCM). However, this simple description\nbelies the complicated structural changes that occur at the\ncentrosome during progression through the cell cycle (Dox-\nsey, 2001; Hinchcliffe and Sluder, 2001; Meraldi and Nigg,\n2002). After a mitotic division, cells inherit a pair of mor-\nphologically distinct centrioles, called the mother and\ndaughter (Marshall, 2001). At some point early in the cell\ncycle, these undergo disorientation, whereby they lose the\northogonal arrangement and become more obviously sepa-\nrated. The precise timing of centriole disorientation is a\nmatter of debate and may be cell type dependent. During S\nand G2, centriole duplication occurs with procentrioles that\ncan only clearly be detected by electron microscopy elongat-\ning at a perpendicular angle from the surface of mother and\ndaughter centrioles. As cells enter mitosis, the original\nmother and daughter centriole become detached from one\nanother in an event termed centrosome disjunction (Hinch-\ncliffe and Sluder, 2001). The two pairs of duplicated centri-\noles then separate toward opposite ends of the cell to facil-\nitate mitotic spindle formation. The PCM also undergoes\nstructural reorganization during cell cycle progression, most\nnotably upon entry into mitosis when additional proteins\nare recruited and there is a change in microtubule nucleating\ncapacity (Khodjakov and Rieder, 1999). The remodeling of\nthe PCM as cells enter mitosis is referred to as centrosome\nmaturation.\nThe changes in centriole and PCM organization that occur\nduring the centrosome duplication cycle have been well\ndocumented by electron and light microscopy of fixed cells\nand isolated centrosomes. However, it is only with the re-\ncent application of green fluorescent protein (GFP) technol-\nogy, coupled with live cell imaging, that it has become\napparent that centrioles are not static organelles within the\ncytoplasm. On the contrary, centrioles exhibit dramatic and\nextensive movements that may be critical for initiating spe-\ncific cell cycle events as well as for determining the distri-\nbution of the microtubule network. The mother centriole, for\nexample, migrates toward the midbody during late mitosis\nin an event that precedes, and may be necessary for, cell\nabscission (Piel et al., 2001). Meanwhile in G1, the mother\ncentriole remains close to the center of the cell, whereas the\nArticle published online ahead of print. Mol. Biol. Cell\n10.1091\/mbc.E03\u2013 02\u2013 0108.

The extent of these movements\nvaries according to cell type, with centrioles exhibiting a\ngreater degree of movement in L929 and NIH 3T3 cells, for\ninstance, than HeLa cells. In HeLa cells, centrioles remain in\nrelative proximity throughout interphase raising the possi-\nbility that proteinaceous material, perhaps part of the PCM,\nacts as a physical tether between mother and daughter cen-\ntriole after disorientation. In fact, even in those cell types\nwhere centrioles migrate far apart, some sort of intercent-\nriolar connection seems to be present because the G1 move-\nments of the two centrioles are correlated and, in S and G2,\nthe centrioles move back closer together and become less\ndynamic (Piel et al., 2000).\nPerhaps the most persuasive evidence that a physical\nlinkage is established between mother and daughter centri-\nole after disorientation is the fact that centrioles remain\npaired in isolated centrosome preparations (Bornens and\nMoudjou, 1999). Electron dense material has been observed\nbetween the mother and daughter centrioles of isolated cen-\ntrosomes, as well as between the pair of basal bodies in\nChlamydomonas, but the molecular nature of these connec-\ntions remains a mystery (Bornens et al., 1987; Paintrand et al.,\n1992; Preble et al., 2000). Some progress, though, has been\nmade into proteins that regulate centriolar cohesion. Nek2A\nis a never in mitosis A (NIMA)-related protein kinase that\nforms a complex with the catalytic subunit of protein phos-\nphatase 1 (PP1) and a large coiled-coil protein called C-Nap1\n(Fry, 2002). Nek2A can phosphorylate itself, PP1 and C-\nNap1, whereas PP1 can dephosphorylate both Nek2A and\nC-Nap1 (Fry et al., 1998b, 1999; Helps et al., 2000). Transient\noverexpression of active Nek2A kinase or microinjection of\nC-Nap1 antibodies leads to premature splitting of the\nmother and daughter centrioles, suggesting that these treat-\nments either stimulate centriole dynamics or somehow mod-\nify the intercentriolar linkage (Fry et al., 1998a; Mayor et al.,\n2000). Coexpression of PP1 with Nek2A suppresses centriole\nsplitting, whereas ectopic expression of inhibitor protein 2, a\nphysiological inhibitor of PP1, stimulates splitting (Meraldi\nand Nigg, 2001; Eto et al., 2002). Together, these studies\nsupport a model in which centriole cohesion is carefully\nmodulated by opposing kinase and phosphatase activities.\nNek2 and C-Nap1 both localize to the proximal ends of\ncentrioles, which would be consistent with their forming an\nanchoring site for an intercentriolar linkage (Fry et al., 1998b;\nMayor et al., 2000). Moreover, C-Nap1 is displaced from\nspindle poles in mitosis at a time when it is hyperphospho-\nrylated in vivo (Mayor et al., 2002). These observations pro-\nvide the basis for a model in which Nek2A promotes cen-\ntrosome disjunction through phosphorylation-induced\ndisplacement of C-Nap1 from centriolar ends (Mayor et al.,\n1999; Fry, 2002). If this model were correct then overexpres-\nsion of a catalytically-inactive Nek2A protein might be ex-\npected to interfere with centrosome disjunction and, subse-\nquently, mitotic progression. However, in transient\ntransfection experiments such phenotypes have been diffi-\ncult to observe. We therefore decided to generate stable cell\nlines expressing active and kinase-dead Nek2A from tetra-\ncycline-inducible promoters. Using these cell lines, we have,\nfor the first time, demonstrated a dominant-negative pheno-\ntype for kinase-dead Nek2A with respect to centrosome\ndisjunction, spindle formation, and chromosome segrega-\ntion. These results provide the strongest evidence yet that\nNek2 has an important function in coordinating centrosome\nstructure and function with mitotic progression alongside\nother protein kinases such as Cdk1, Plk1, and Aurora-A\n(Nigg, 2001).\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCell Culture and Transfections\nT-REx-U2OS cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), as well as derived cell\nlines, were grown at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in DMEM\nsupplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-strepto-\nmycin (100 IU\/ml and 100 \u0001g\/ml, respectively). Hygromycin B (200\n\u0001g\/ml) was added to maintain the integrated vector expressing the\nTet repressor protein. Transfection of expression plasmids was per-\nformed using calcium phosphate as described previously (Fry and\nFaragher, 2001). To induce and maintain expression from tetracy-\ncline-responsive promoters, tetracycline or doxycycline (1 \u0001g\/ml)\nwas added to the culture medium every 24 or 48 h, respectively. To\ninduce cytokinesis failure, cytochalasin D (0.6 \u0001g\/ml) was added.\nPlasmid Constructions\nGeneration of pEGFP-Nek2A has been described previously\n(Hames and Fry, 2002). pEGFP-Nek2A-K37R was made by excision\nof Nek2A-K37R from pGEM-Nek2-K37R (Fry et al., 1995) on a\nNaeI-BamHI fragment and inserting it into a pEGFP-C1 vector (BD\nBiosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) modified to include a T7\npromoter upstream of the enhanced green fluorescent protein\n(EGFP) coding region. To generate vectors for inducible expression\nof C-terminal myc-His\u2013tagged proteins, full-length cDNAs encod-\ning wild-type Nek2A or Nek2A-K37R were excised from pEGFP-\nNek2A or pEGFP-Nek2A-K37R, respectively, as SphI-XhoI blunted\nfragments and subcloned into the pcDNA4\/TO\/myc-HisA induc-\nible eukaryotic expression vector (Invitrogen) cut with XhoI and\nblunted. To generate vectors for inducible expression of N-terminal\nEGFP\u2013tagged proteins, EGFP-Nek2A, wild-type, or K37R, was ex-\ncised from pEGFP-Nek2A or pEGFP-Nek2A-K37R, respectively, on\nan AgeI (blunted)-XbaI fragment and subcloned into the\npcDNA4\/TO inducible eukaryotic expression vector (Invitrogen)\ncut with EcoRV and XbaI.\nGeneration of Tetracycline-inducible Cell Lines\nStable cell lines were generated by introducing the relevant con-\nstruct into a 10-cm dish of T-REx-U2OS cells by using calcium\nphosphate-mediated transfection. After 24 h, cells were washed and\nincubated in selective media containing Zeocin (400 \u0001g\/ml; Invitro-\ngen) and hygromycin B (200 \u0001g\/ml) until foci containing \u000150\u2013100\ncells were detected (\u00013\u20134 wk). Culture dishes were then washed\nwith 1\u0002 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before picking foci by\nusing paper cloning discs (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO; Z37, 443-\n1). Each disk was soaked in 1\u0002 PBS containing 0.5 mM EDTA and\nthen placed over the foci of cells for 5\u201310 min at 37\u00b0C. Discs were\nthen transferred into individual wells of a 24-well plate and selec-\ntive medium added. After attachment of cells to plastic culture\nwells, cloning discs were removed and individual clones expanded\nin selective media before testing for protein expression by Western\nblotting and fluorescence microscopy.\nCell Extraction, Protein Electrophoresis, and\nWestern Blotting\nTo prepare cell extracts, cells were washed once with ice-cold 1\u0002\nPBS before direct lysis on the dish in hot (95\u00b0C) SDS-gel loading\nbuffer. Lysed cells were collected from the plate with a cell scraper\nand heated to 95\u00b0C for 10 min. Chromosomal DNA was sheared by\npassage through a 27-gauge needle before centrifugation for 10 min.\nNek2A Promotes Centrosome Disjunction\nVol. 14, July 2003 2877\nProtein gel electrophoresis and Western blotting was performed as\ndescribed previously (Fry et al., 1998b). Primary antibodies used\nwere anti-Nek2 (1 \u0001g\/ml; Fry et al., 1999) and anti-phospho-H3 (1\n\u0001g\/ml; Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), whereas second-\nary antibodies were alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit or\nanti-mouse IgGs (1:7500; Promega, Madison, WI).\nFixed Cell Microscopy\nImmunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described pre-\nviously (Fry et al., 1998a; Fry and Faragher, 2001), except for GT335\nstaining where cells were first detergent extracted according to\nMacRae et al. (1990). Primary antibodies used were anti-Nek2 (1\n\u0001g\/ml; Zymed, South San Francisco, CA; Fry et al., 1999), anti-C-\nNap1 (1 \u0001g\/ml; R63 anti-C-term antibody; Fry et al., 1998b), anti-\nmyc (9E10; undiluted supernatant), anti-Plk1 (10 \u0001g\/ml; Upstate\nBiotechnology), anti-polyglutamylated tubulin (GT335; 1:200), \u0002-cy-\ntokeratin 18 caspase cleavage product (M30 CytoDEATH; Roche\nDiagnostics, Indianapolis, IN), anti-\u0003-tubulin (0.15 \u0001g\/ml; Sigma-\nAldrich), and anti-\u0002-tubulin (0.3 \u0001g\/ml; Sigma-Aldrich). Secondary\nantibodies used were Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit and rabbit\nanti-mouse IgGs (1 \u0001g\/ml; Molecular Probes), donkey anti-rabbit\nand sheep anti-mouse biotinylated whole antibodies (1:100; Amer-\nsham Biosciences UK, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, United\nKingdom). Streptavidin Texas Red (1:200; Amersham Biosciences\nUK) was used to detect biotinylated antibodies, whereas DNA was\nstained with Hoechst 33258 (0.2 \u0001g\/ml; Calbiochem, San Diego,\nCA). Fluorescence images were captured on a Nikon TE300 inverted\nmicroscope using an ORCA ER charge-couple device camera\n(Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Japan) by using Openlab 3.09 software\n(Improvision, Coventry, United Kingdom) and processed using\nAdobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). Digital deconvo-\nlution was performed by capturing optical z-sections at 0.1-\u0001m\nsteps through the cell of interest using a high-speed Piezo focus\ndrive device (Orbit II). Volume deconvolution (Openlab 3.09; Im-\nprovision) by using five nearest neighbors was used on each z-\nsection before display as maximum intensity projections.\nCentrosome Intensity Measurements\nCells were processed for indirect immunofluorescence microscopy\nby using anti-C-Nap1 or anti-\u0003-tubulin antibodies, as described\nabove. Using constant exposure times and gain settings determined\nto be within the linear range of the camera, we captured fluores-\ncence images of centrosomes and mitotic spindle poles. A 1.5-\u0001m2\nregion of interest was positioned to encompass each centrosome\nand the mean intensity (integrated optical density) signal per pixel\nwithin this region of interest, minus background, was measured.\nMeasurements were made on each centrosome in 20 cells for each\ncondition and independent experiments performed three times.\nLive Cell Imaging\nFor live cell microscopy, cells were grown on coverslips and in-\nduced with doxycycline as indicated in the text. Coverslips were\nthen washed once with 1\u0002 PBS before mounting in a steel coverslip\nholder (made in house) in CO2-independent medium without glu-\ntamine (Invitrogen) but with doxycycline. The surface of the me-\ndium was overlaid with mineral oil (Sigma-Aldrich) to prevent\nevaporation. The steel coverslip holder was mounted in a Patch\nSlice MicroIncubator regulated at 37\u00b0C by a TC-202A temperature\ncontroller (Harvard Apparatus Medical Systems Research Products,\nsupplied by Digitimer, Hertfordshire, United Kingdom). The Patch\nSlice MicroIncubator was placed on the microscope stage and im-\nages captured at 2- or 5-min intervals with the microscope system\ndescribed above. At each time point, five optical sections (z-planes)\nat 0.5-\u0001m intervals were captured using a high-speed Piezo focus\ndrive (Orbit II) attached to a 60\u0002 oil objective (numerical aperture\n1.4) and merged using Openlab software. Images were processed\nusing Adobe Photoshop or converted to QuickTime movies.\nFlow Cytometry\nCell cycle distributions were determined by measuring DNA con-\ntent by flow cytometry after staining of cells with propidium iodide.\nSpecifically, 1 \u0002 106 cells were washed with 1\u0002 PBS and slowly\nresuspended in 1 ml of 70% ethanol (\u000320\u00b0C) before storage at\n\u000320\u00b0C. Fixed cells were pelleted and washed with 1\u0002 PBS before\nresuspension in 1 ml of DNA stain (0.02 mg\/ml propidium iodide,\n0.2 mg\/ml RNase A in 1\u0002 PBS) and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C.\nDNA content was measured using a FACScan II instrument (BD\nBiosciences, San Jose, CA) and analyzed using CellQuest.\nRESULTS\nGeneration of Tetracycline-inducible Nek2A Cell\nLines\nTo address the role of Nek2A in centrosome organization\nand cell cycle progression, human U2OS cell lines were\nestablished with integrated copies of the Nek2A cDNA\ndriven from tetracycline-responsive promoters. Four \u201cTet-\nON\u201d cell lines were generated comprising wild-type Nek2A\nor the catalytically-inactive (kinase-dead) Nek2A-K37R mu-\ntant with either an N-terminal enhanced GFP tag or a C-\nterminal myc-hexahistidine (myc-His) tag (Figure 1A).\nWestern blotting of cell extracts with a Nek2 antibody re-\nvealed expression of a protein of the expected size in each\ncell line upon 24-h treatment with the tetracycline analog\ndoxycycline (Figure 1B). Several independent clones were\nisolated for each cell line (Figure 1C; our unpublished data),\nbut for this study, clones were used in which the GFP and\nmyc-His\u2013tagged proteins were induced to a level that was\nsix- to eight- and four- to fivefold higher than endogenous\nNek2A, respectively. Time courses of induction showed that\nrecombinant proteins were expressed within 1 h of tetracy-\ncline addition and reached a maximal level by 6 h (Figure\n1D).\nFluorescence microscopy was performed on each cell line\nafter 24-h induction. Exogenous Nek2A proteins primarily\nlocalized to the interphase centrosome as indicated by colo-\ncalization of the myc or GFP signal with \u0003-tubulin (Figure\n2A). Isolation of centrosomes from these cells by sucrose\ngradient centrifugation also showed enrichment of recombi-\nnant proteins by Western blot (our unpublished data). In-\nduction of wild-type Nek2A, either GFP or myc-His tagged,\nled to premature centriole splitting as judged by the loss of\nclose juxtaposition of the two \u0003-tubulin\u2013stained structures.\nThis was not observed with the kinase-dead versions of\nNek2A. Reassuringly, these results fall in line with those\nobtained in transient transfection experiments in which it\nwas shown that active, but not inactive, Nek2A can induce\ncentriole splitting (Fry et al., 1998a).\nOn entry into mitosis, centrosome staining was lost (Fig-\nure 2B), supporting the finding that Nek2A is actively de-\nstroyed by the proteasome, rather than being transcription-\nally down regulated, in early mitosis (Hames et al., 2001).\nImportantly, destruction led to loss of Nek2A from spindle\npoles and not simply from the noncentrosomal pool. In\ncontrast to a recent report (Kim et al., 2002), no localization\nto mitotic chromosomes (Figure 2B, b) or the midbody (our\nunpublished data) was observed. By Western blotting for\nA.J. Faragher and A.M. Fry\nMolecular Biology of the Cell2878\nNek2 protein in asynchronous cells incubated with cyclo-\nheximide (Figure 2C), the half-life of recombinant Nek2A-\nK37R-myc-His was determined to be very similar to endog-\nenous Nek2A at \u00011 h (Hames et al., 2001). Thus, based upon\nlocalization, activity and stability measurements, these cell\nlines represent excellent new tools to study Nek2 function.\nAnalysis of Nek2A-induced Centriole Splitting in\nLive Cells\nIn certain cell types (e.g., L929) centrioles exhibit significant\nmobility during interphase (Piel et al., 2000), but in others the\nmother and daughter centriole remain in proximity. We\ncalculated that in the parental U2OS cell line, although two\ndots can almost invariably be distinguished, \u000410% cells (n\n\u0005200) have centrioles that are \u00052 \u0001m apart (Figure 3A).\nHowever, doxycycline-induced expression of GFP-Nek2A\nor Nek2A-myc-His for 24 h stimulated a premature splitting\nof centrioles in 67 and 19% cells (n \u0005 200), respectively\n(Figure 3A). This correlates with the higher level of expres-\nsion in the GFP-Nek2A cell line and supports the notion that\nsplitting depends upon achieving a certain threshold of\nNek2A activity that is presumably in excess of competing\nPP1 activity. Proteasomal destruction in G1 is likely to re-\nduce the level of recombinant Nek2A below this threshold\nexplaining why splitting is not observed in 100% of cells (Fry\net al., 1998a; Meraldi and Nigg, 2001).\nTo study Nek2A localization and centriole splitting in live\ncells, time-lapse microscopy was performed on cells that had\nbeen induced to express wild-type GFP-Nek2A for 24 h.\nGFP-Nek2A protein was clearly detected at the two centri-\noles in live cells, providing conclusive evidence that previ-\nFigure 1.

In most cells, the residual GFP fluores-\ncence not associated with centrioles was detected in the\ncytoplasm and was faintly punctate in nature (our unpub-\nlished data). By selecting cells that had widely spaced cen-\ntrioles (\u00055 \u0001m) at the start of filming, it became apparent\nthat Nek2A-induced splitting is not a transient event. In each\ncell, centrioles were observed for at least 3 h and, in the\nmajority of cases (82%, n\u0007 11), centrioles remained far apart\nand sometimes moved further apart (Figure 3, B and C).\nMoreover, fine movements of the individual centrioles\nseemed independent, implying that, if they were still linked,\nthe connection was not under obvious tension (our unpub-\nlished data). Only in two cells (18%) did split centrioles\nreturn to a separation distance of \u00045 \u0001m. However, as the\ninitial intercentriolar distance was\u000410 \u0001m in these cells, it is\npossible that any intercentriolar connections had not yet\nbeen fully dismantled. In summary, live cell imaging dem-\nonstrates that Nek2A overexpression stimulates either loss\nor relaxation of the attachment between mother and daugh-\nter centrioles.\nC-Nap1 Is Only Partially Displaced from Split\nCentrioles\nThe hypothesis has been put forward that phosphorylation\nof C-Nap1 by Nek2 at the onset of mitosis triggers its dis-\nplacement from the proximal ends of centrioles which, in\nturn, leads to centrosome disjunction (Mayor et al., 2002). We\ntherefore examined whether premature splitting of inter-\nphase centrioles by active Nek2A kinase was accompanied\nby a similar loss of the C-Nap1 protein to that seen in normal\nmitosis. U2OS cells were fixed in cold methanol and pro-\ncessed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy with an-\nti-C-Nap1 antibodies. Quantitative imaging of parental\nU2OS cells (Figure 4A, a) or the GFP-Nek2A cell line without\ninduction (Figure 4A, b) indicated a 10-fold reduction in\nC-Nap1 protein on mitotic spindle poles compared with\nunsplit centrosomes in neighboring interphase cells (Figure\n4B). Imaging of C-Nap1 in the GFP-Nek2A cell line after\ndoxycycline induction revealed that interphase cells with\nsplit centrioles had reduced C-Nap1 abundance, although\nnot to the same extent as at mitotic spindle poles (Figure 4A,\nc and d). Quantitation revealed only a twofold decrease in\nC-Nap1 abundance on split, compared with unsplit, centri-\noles (Figure 4B). To determine the specificity of this re-\nsponse, similar quantitative imaging was performed on\n\u0003-tubulin (Figure 4B). In contrast to C-Nap1, the abundance\nof \u0003-tubulin at mitotic spindle poles was approximately\nthreefold higher than at interphase centrosomes in agree-\nment with previous studies showing recruitment of \u0003-tubu-\nlin during centrosome maturation (Khodjakov and Rieder,\n1999). \u0003-Tubulin levels though were relatively unchanged\nbetween split and unsplit centrioles, suggesting that the\nmoderate displacement of C-Nap1 protein is a specific effect\nand not due to general disintegration of the centrosome\nstructure. However, whether the twofold reduction in C-\nNap1 protein is sufficient to trigger the centriole splitting\nremains to be proven.\nKinase-Dead Nek2A Induces Accumulation of\nMultiple Centrosomes\nTransient transfection of kinase-dead Nek2A had not re-\nvealed an obvious mitotic defect (Fry et al., 1998a).

The reason for this is clear now that we know\nthat Nek2A is destroyed soon after mitotic entry (Hames et\nal., 2001). In contrast, kinase-dead Nek2A was capable of\nsuppressing nocodazole-induced centriole splitting, imply-\ning that it could exert a dominant-negative activity (Meraldi\nand Nigg, 2001). We therefore decided to reexamine the\nconsequences of overexpressing kinase-dead Nek2A by us-\ning the tetracycline-inducible cell lines. Careful examination\nof centrosomes in the Nek2A-K37R-myc-His cell line first\nrevealed that \u000550% of cells (n \u0007 500) had centrosomes that\nwere abnormal in appearance, i.e., they no longer consisted\nof just two discrete dots of \u00011 \u0001m in diameter (Figure 5A).\nThis was evident not only after immunostaining with anti-\nNek2 antibodies (Figure 5B) but also with anti-\u0003-tubulin\n(Figure 5C) and anti-C-Nap1 (our unpublished data) anti-\nbodies. In some cases, only one or two structures could be\ndistinguished, although these were often much larger than a\nnormal centrosome and irregular in shape (Figure 5, B and\nC, d). In other cases, however, there were clearly more than\ntwo centrosomes that again were not necessarily of normal\nappearance (Figure 5, B and C, b and c). These phenotypes\nwere strictly dependent upon expression of the recombinant\nprotein because they were not observed in the parental cell\nline or in the mutant cell line in the absence of tetracycline.\nFigure 4. C-Nap1 is still present\non Nek2A-induced split centro-\nsomes. (A) U2OS T-REx cells (a)\nor GFP-Nek2A cells without (b)\nor with 24-h doxycycline induc-\ntion (c and d) were fixed and im-\nmunostained with anti-C-Nap1\nantibodies. Images were captured\nunder identical conditions to al-\nlow comparison of C-Nap1 signal\nintensity.

(B) Abundance of C-Nap1\nand \u0003-tubulin at centrosomes was\ncalculated by measuring mean\npixel intensities as indicated in\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nCentrosomes in 20 cells for each\ncondition were imaged, quanti-\ntated, and normalized to the in-\ntensity of unsplit interphase cen-\ntrosomes in the parental U2OS\ncell line (given an arbitrary value\nof 1.0). Results show the mean of\nthree independent experiments in\nwhich all cells were fixed at the\nsame time and immunostained\nwith C-Nap1 antibodies under\nidentical conditions.\nA.J. Faragher and A.M. Fry\nMolecular Biology of the Cell2882\nMoreover, the abnormal phenotypes were evident in more\nthan one clone of the Nek2A-K37R-myc-His cell line. Micro-\ntubule regrowth assays after cold-induced microtubule de-\npolymerization indicated that all of these centrosomes were\nstill capable of efficient microtubule nucleation (our unpub-\nlished data).\nWhere more than two dots were observed, it was impor-\ntant to determine whether each dot contained a centriole\nrather than simply being an aggregate of centrosomal pro-\nteins. Induced cells were therefore stained with the GT335\nmonoclonal antibody that recognizes polyglutamylated tu-\nbulin and hence acts as a well-characterized marker of cen-\ntrioles (Bobinnec et al., 1998). Whereas only two GT335 dots\nwere clearly distinguished in uninduced cells (Figure 5D,\na\u2013c), more than two GT335-stained dots were evident in\nmany cells expressing kinase-dead Nek2A (Figure 5D, d\u2013f).\nHence, cells expressing kinase-dead Nek2A accumulate ab-\nnormal centrosomes that fall into two categories: centro-\nsomes with extracentrosomal material and centrosomes with\nsupernumerary centrioles that remain in proximity. These\ntwo categories are not mutually exclusive making it difficult\nto score each phenotype separately.\nSpindle and Segregation Defects Induced by Kinase-\nDead Nek2A Expression\nThe presence of some cells with more than two centrioles\nraised the possibility that kinase-dead Nek2A was acting in\na dominant-negative manner to prevent separation of\nmother and daughter centrioles at mitosis. To determine\nwhether such abnormalities may result from a failure of\ncentrosome disjunction, mitotic cells were examined. In the\nparental cell line, only 3.5% (n \u0007 300) of mitotic cells exhib-\nited any unusual spindle structures with these being a mix\nof monopolar and multipolar arrays. However, induction of\nkinase-dead Nek2A for 24 h led to a 4.5-fold increase in\nabnormal spindles (15.7%; n \u0007 450) (Figure 6A). DNA and\nmicrotubule staining revealed that the overwhelming ma-\njority of these abnormal mitoses contained monoastral ar-\nrays of microtubules surrounded by a chromosome rosette\n(Figure 6B, b\u2013d). By immunostaining cells with \u0003-tubulin\nantibodies and capturing optical z-sections through the mo-\nnopolar spindles, it was clear that centrosomes had not\nsubstantially separated in either the x, y, or z-axis (Figure\n6C, b). Measurements showed the average pole-to-pole dis-\ntance in the monopolar spindles to be 2.1 \u0001m, compared\nwith 9.2 \u0001m in a bipolar metaphase spindle. The frequency\nof spindle abnormalities did not increase with longer times\nof induction, suggesting that the maximal level of interfer-\nence had been achieved for this cell line.\nSimilar monopolar spindle defects have been described\nunder conditions where centrosome maturation, rather than\ndisjunction, is defective (Lane and Nigg, 1996). We therefore\nimmunostained cells for Plk1, which is first recruited to\ncentrosomes during centrosome maturation (Golsteyn et al.,\n1995). In kinase-dead Nek2A-expressing cells, the recruit-\nment of Plk1 to the poles of monopolar spindles was similar\nto that in normal bipolar spindles (Figure 6C, c and d). This,\ntogether with the normal increase in \u0003-tubulin abundance\n(Figure 6C, a and b), indicates that the monopolar spindle\nphenotype induced by kinase-dead Nek2A is not a result of\ndefective centrosome maturation, at least with respect to\nPlk1 and \u0003-tubulin recruitment. Importantly, the abundance\nof C-Nap1 at poles of monopolar spindles was indistin-\nguishable from that at poles of bipolar spindles, indicating\nthat apparently complete C-Nap1 displacement had oc-\ncurred (compare Figure 6D with Figure 4A). Thus, the block\nto centrosome separation could not be attributed to a failure\nto displace C-Nap1.\nClearly, a significant proportion of cells expressing kinase-\ndead Nek2A was capable of forming bipolar spindles, pos-\nFigure 5.

However,\nchromosome segregation defects were frequently observed\nin many of these cells as indicated by misaligned chromo-\nsomes in metaphase cells, lagging chromosomes in anaphase\ncells and thin chromatin bridges in telophase cells (Figure\n6E). Further evidence for mitotic progression defects came\nfrom the appearance of multi- and micronucleated inter-\nphase cells (Figure 7A). Immunofluorescence staining of\nthese cells with anti-C-Nap1 antibodies indicated that mi-\ncronucleated cells generally contained a normal complement\nof two centrosomes (Figure 7B, a and b), whereas multinu-\ncleated cells usually contained clusters of more than two\ncentrosomes suggestive of cytokinesis failure (Figure 7B, c\nand d). Induction for 72 h of kinase-dead Nek2A caused an\napproximate sixfold increase in multinucleation compared\nwith the parental U2OS cells (Figure 7C). As a positive\ncontrol, multinucleation was demonstrated in cells treated\nwith cytochalasin D, which blocks cytokinesis through in-\nhibiting formation of the contractile actin ring.

Fry\nMolecular Biology of the Cell2884\nthese data provide the first evidence that alteration of Nek2\nactivity can interfere with mitotic progression in human\ncells.\nExpression of Kinase-Dead Nek2A Alters the DNA\nContent of the Cell Population\nTo determine whether these centrosome and mitotic defects\nled to a major loss of cell viability, cell cycle arrest, or\napoptosis, a number of further experiments were performed\nwith the Nek2A-K37R-myc-His cells. Growth curves re-\nvealed no significant change in proliferation or survival rate\nafter 12 days of tetracycline induction (Figure 8A). Equally,\nthere was no sudden appearance of apoptotic cells in the\npopulation as measured by antibody staining for cleaved\ncytokeratin 18 (our unpublished data). Similarly, mitotic\nindex counts and Western blotting for the mitosis-specific\nphospho-H3 epitope revealed no substantial mitotic arrest\n(our unpublished data). Together, these observations indi-\ncate that the centrosome and mitotic abnormalities do not\nlead to a gross loss of viability within the cell population.\nFlow cytometric analysis, however, revealed a clear reduc-\ntion in the proportion of cells with a 2N DNA content after\n8-days induction, leading to the majority of cells having\n\u00052N DNA (Figure 8, B and C). One interpretation of this\nresult is that there is a delay to cell cycle progression, an\nintriguing possibility in light of the mutant phenotypes of\nfungal NIMA-related kinases. However, our data is equally\nconsistent with the increasing percentage of multinucleated\ncells that were present in the population as a result of either\nfailed mitosis or abortive cytokinesis. Indeed, because the\nkinase-dead Nek2A cells were derived from an osteosar-\ncoma cancer cell line, it is entirely plausible that they can\ntolerate a chromosomal instability phenotype that overtime\nleads to a gradual increase in ploidy without obvious cell\ndeath.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this study, we have examined Nek2 kinase function\nthrough generation and phenotypic characterization of tet-\nracycline-inducible cell lines. First, we demonstrate that\nNek2A kinase localizes to centrosomes in live cells. Second,\nwe show that inappropriate activation of Nek2A kinase\nleads to sustained centrosome splitting and the apparent\nloss of an intercentriolar connection. Third, we reveal that\nC-Nap1 is still present on split centrosomes, arguing against\nC-Nap1 displacement being the sole cause of centrosome\nsplitting. Finally, we present evidence that kinase-inactive\nNek2A can act in a dominant-negative manner to interfere\nwith bipolar spindle formation and chromosome segrega-\ntion. Thus, interference with Nek2A activity, both in a pos-\nitive and negative manner, produces phenotypes that are\nconsistent with a role for this kinase in centrosome disjunc-\ntion. Importantly, this study provides the first direct evi-\ndence that abrogation of Nek2 function has the potential to\ncause aneuploidy in human cells. These phenotypes also\nstrengthen the hypothesis that centrosome abnormalities can\ncontribute to the sort of chromosome instability that is typ-\nical of high-grade tumors (Lingle et al., 1998; Pihan et al.,\n1998).\nFigure 7.

However, the precise functions of Nek2 in\nmitotic progression remain far from understood. The gener-\nation of inducible cell lines provides us with powerful new\ntools to study the regulation and function of the Nek2A\nsplice variant. Interestingly, transient overexpression of both\nactive and inactive Nek2A kinase led to dispersal of the\ncentrosome and loss of a functional microtubule organizing\ncenter (Fry et al., 1998a). This was not a major phenotype of\nthe inducible cell lines, most likely because the level of\noverexpression per cell is considerably lower than in the\ntransient transfection experiments. Nevertheless, during our\nlive cell recordings of both wild-type and kinase-dead GFP-\nNek2A, we did observe centrosomes that seemed to shed\nfragments or particles into the cytoplasm (our unpublished\ndata). This not only supports the hypothesis that Nek2 con-\ntributes to the assembly and maintenance of an intact cen-\ntrosome structure (Fry et al., 2000b; Uto and Sagata, 2000)\nbut also implies that tumor cells with significant amplifica-\ntion of Nek2 might lose a focused microtubule organizing\ncenter.\nAs a means to unravel Nek2 function, these cell lines rely\non protein overexpression. The identification of a specific\nNek2 inhibitor would therefore be of great benefit in con-\nfirming the role of endogenous Nek2 kinase activity in the\ncontrol of chromosome segregation and mitotic progression,\nparticularly because it has not yet proven possible to iden-\ntify effective siRNA molecules despite much effort on our\npart. Because more than half the cells expressing active\nGFP-Nek2A have split centrosomes and the GFP-Nek2A\nprotein acts as a vital marker of the centrosome, these cell\nlines make excellent reagents for high-throughput micro-\nscope-based assays to screen for in vivo inhibitors of Nek2\nkinase. A small molecule inhibitor may also prove useful as\na therapeutic agent in tumors that show up-regulation of\nNek2 expression (Wai et al., 2002).\nFigure 8.

Fry\nMolecular Biology of the Cell2886\nNek2A Activation Stimulates Centrosome\nDisjunction\nThere is growing evidence that centrosome disjunction is\ntriggered by altering the protein phosphorylation status of\ncore centrosomal components. Kinases implicated in regu-\nlating centrosome cohesion include Nek2A (Fry et al., 1998a;\nMeraldi and Nigg, 2001), Cdk2 (Lacey et al., 1999; Meraldi\nand Nigg, 2001), and p160ROCK (Chevrier et al., 2002),\nwhereas phosphatase involvement has been proposed for\nPP1 (Helps et al., 2000; Eto et al., 2002) and Cdc14A (Mailand\net al., 2002). Nek2A directly binds PP1 via a KVHF motif in\nits C-terminal noncatalytic domain. Because Nek2A is acti-\nvated by autophosphorylation (Fry et al., 1999), PP1 can\nnegatively regulate Nek2A by dephosphorylation. Con-\nversely, Nek2A can phosphorylate PP1 reducing its phos-\nphatase activity (Helps et al., 2000). This double-negative\nfeedback produces an exquisitely sensitive bistable switch\nthat dictates the phosphorylation status of Nek2A sub-\nstrates. In these experiments, we show that increasing the\nlevel of Nek2A expression above fivefold is sufficient to flip\nthe switch in favor of centrosome splitting. Moreover, our\ntime-lapse observations of centrosome dynamics suggest\nthat the intercentriolar linkage has been permanently lost.\nCentrosomes that were \u00055 \u0001m apart at the start of filming\nrarely returned to within this distance over the observation\nperiod. Clearly, in these in vivo experiments, it is difficult to\nstate with absolute certainty that connections have been\nirrevocably broken. It remains possible that Nek2A activity\nalters the conformation of the linkage such that it becomes\nsufficiently long and flexible to accommodate greater inter-\ncentriolar separations. Because our experiments were not\nperformed on synchronized cells, the duplication state of the\nsplit centrioles was not known. However, in all our fixed\nand live cell recordings, four separated structures were\nnever observed strongly implying that Nek2A expression\ndoes not trigger the release of procentrioles from their sites\nof synthesis adjacent to mother and daughter centrioles. We\nbelieve that it acts specifically on the connections between\nmother and daughter centriole.\nKinase-Dead Nek2A Interferes with Centrosome\nDisjunction and Mitotic Progression\nThe most striking results of this study are the consequences\nof overexpressing kinase-dead Nek2A. First, many cells ac-\ncumulated unusually large and irregularly shaped centro-\nsomes, and centrosomes that clearly had supernumerary\n(\u00052) centrioles. Both of these phenotypes are common in\ncancer cells (Nigg, 2002). The unusually large centrosomes\nmay result from accumulation of excess kinase-dead Nek2A\nprotein, which in turn causes recruitment of other centroso-\nmal proteins, including at least \u0003-tubulin and C-Nap1. This\nis consistent with data showing that Xenopus Nek2 is re-\nquired for recruitment of \u0003-tubulin during zygotic centro-\nsome assembly (Fry et al., 2000b). Surprisingly, in transient\ntransfection experiments, the opposite phenotype was ob-\nserved in that expression of kinase-dead Nek2A led to cen-\ntrosome dispersal. We interpret this difference in terms of\nthe relative expression levels of the ectopic protein: in the\ninduced cell line, the level of overexpression is sufficiently\nlow that most protein can still localize to the centrosome\nwhere it acts as a site of recruitment for other centrosomal\nproteins; in the transient transfections, however, the massive\noverexpression means that the bulk of the protein can no\nlonger reside at the centrosome and therefore titrates other\ncentrosomal proteins out into the cytoplasm. From either\nperspective, the experiments emphasize the importance of\nNek2 as a critical scaffold element of the centrosome.\nPerhaps more informative with regard to Nek2 kinase\nfunction is the presence of cells with multiple centrioles.\nInterpretation of this phenotype is aided by the observation\nof mitotic cells with monopolar spindles and unseparated\ncentrosomes. Because these centrosomes had recruited both\n\u0003-tubulin and Plk1, it seems reasonable to propose that they\nhad undergone some degree of G2\/M maturation but then\nfailed to separate. It is interesting to note that centrosomes at\nthe heart of the monoastral microtubule arrays were sepa-\nrated on average by 2.1 \u0001m. For comparison, inhibition of\nthe motor protein Eg5, either by antibody microinjection or\nby the small molecule inhibitor monastrol, led to monopolar\nspindles with centrosomes that were\u00042 \u0001m apart (Blangy et\nal., 1995; Kapoor et al., 2000). Although it is difficult to know\nwhether this difference is significant based upon the fact that\nthese experiments have been performed in different cell\ntypes, it is tempting to speculate that, in the kinase-dead\nNek2A-expressing cells, motor proteins have attempted to\nseparate centrosomes but failed because they are still phys-\nically attached.\nBecause we have not been able to follow live cells through\nmitosis, it is not clear whether the monopolar spindles are\neventually resolved into pseudobipolar spindles that can\ncomplete mitosis. This may happen in some cells after de-\nstruction of the recombinant Nek2A protein. However, the\nfrequent observation of chromosome segregation errors on\nbipolar spindles as well as multinucleated and micronucle-\nated interphase cells suggests that aneuploidy frequently\nresults from the expression of kinase-dead Nek2A. Unsepa-\nrated centrosomes may also directly interfere with cytokine-\nsis, leading to tetraploidization. This would provide an ex-\nplanation for the multinucleated cells with multiple\ncentrosomes. Tetraploidization as a result of mitotic failure\nhas been proposed to account for the supernumerary cen-\ntrosomes generated by aberrant expression of another cen-\ntrosomal kinase, Aurora-A (Meraldi et al., 2002). Indeed, this\nmay represent a common pathway for cancer cells to acquire\nmultiple centrosomes and a chromosome instability pheno-\ntype, particularly in cells lacking p53 (Nigg, 2002).\nThe gradual change in ploidy of the whole cell population\nalso supports the idea that kinase-dead Nek2A promotes\nchromosome instability. Besides this, though, there was no\nsignificant decrease in cell proliferation, no striking mitotic\narrest and no induction of programmed cell death. Although\nthis was disappointing, similar results have been reported\nafter spindle disruption and aneuploidy induced by inter-\nference with another centrosomal protein, pericentrin (Pu-\nrohit et al., 1999), and it may reflect loss of or adaptation to\nmitotic checkpoints in transformed cells. Furthermore, pro-\nteasomal destruction of Nek2A, as previously discussed,\nmay be an important explanation for the long-term survival,\nas well as why a larger fraction of mitotic cells do not have\nabnormal spindles. We are currently generating cell lines\nexpressing nondestructible, kinase-dead Nek2A in an at-\ntempt to resolve this issue.\nNek2A Promotes Centrosome Disjunction\nVol. 14, July 2003 2887\nC-Nap1 and the Molecular Nature of the\nIntercentriolar Linkage\nA key substrate for Nek2 at the centrosome is C-Nap1, a\nlarge coiled-coil protein with no obvious enzymatic activity\n(Fry et al., 1998b; Mack et al., 1998). C-Nap1 localizes to\nproximal ends of centrioles in interphase but is displaced\nfrom mitotic spindle poles. This coincides with the time\nwhen it is maximally phosphorylated in vivo (Mayor et al.,\n2002). Using quantitative immunofluorescence microscopy,\nhowever, we found that although there is a 10-fold reduc-\ntion in C-Nap1 abundance at mitotic spindle poles, there is\nonly a twofold reduction in C-Nap1 abundance at split\ninterphase centrioles. Furthermore, C-Nap1 was virtually\nabsent from the poles of monoastral spindles in cells ex-\npressing kinase-inactive Nek2A. Our results therefore raise\nthe possibility that Nek2A activation alone is not sufficient to\ncompletely trigger C-Nap1 displacement and nor is C-Nap1\ndisplacement necessarily sufficient for centrosome disjunc-\ntion. Cohen and coworkers estimated that in vitro Nek2A\nwas capable of introducing 13 moles of phosphate into 1\nmole of the C-terminal domain of C-Nap1 alone (Helps et al.,\n2000). Hence, it is possible that during interphase, due to the\nantagonistic action of PP1, there is only partial phosphory-\nlation of C-Nap1 by the recombinant Nek2A and hence\npartial displacement. At the G2\/M transition full activation\nof Nek2A would lead to hyperphosphorylation and com-\nplete displacement of C-Nap1. Alternatively, other mitotic\nkinases such as Plk1, Cdk1 or Aurora-A might contribute to\nthe full displacement of C-Nap1 from spindle poles at the\nG2\/M transition (Figure 9). Whether the twofold reduction\nin C-Nap1 at the centrosome is sufficient to cause disassem-\nbly of the intercentriolar linkage is a difficult question to\nanswer. Phosphorylation of C-Nap1 may also cause loss of\ninteraction with other components of the intercentriolar\nlinkage leading to centriole splitting. However, C-Nap1 may\nnot be the only target of Nek2 within the linkage and it could\nbe the cumulative phosphorylation of several proteins by\nNek2A that triggers centrosome disjunction. Further insight\ninto the mechanism of centrosome disjunction will clearly\nrequire a more detailed understanding of the molecular\nnature of the intercentriolar linkage.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank all members of the laboratory for useful discussion, P.\nHerron for help with cell culture, and Dr. R.S.

Centrosome disjunction and C-Nap1 displacement may\nbe distinct events. The schematic model illustrates centrosome dis-\njunction (A) and C-Nap1 displacement (B) as independent events\nthat take place upon onset of mitosis. Disjunction of centrosomes,\ni.e., loss of cohesion between mother and daughter centrioles, is\ntriggered by activation of Nek2A kinase. This itself is the result of a\nloss of the antagonistic activity of PP1, perhaps through phosphor-\nylation of PP1 or binding of Inhibitor-2. The substrates of Nek2\ninvolved in centrosome cohesion are likely to include C-Nap1 (blue\nsphere), although phosphorylation by Nek2 alone may not be suf-\nficient to completely displace C-Nap1 from the centrosome. Nek2\nmay also have other substrates within the intercentriolar linkage.\nLikewise, full C-Nap1 displacement may require additional phos-\nphorylation by other mitotic kinases.\nA.J.
