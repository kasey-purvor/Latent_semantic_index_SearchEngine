It is argued that \nearlier research on youth transitions has tended to understate the level of complexity \nthat characterised youth transitions in the early 1960s and 1970s. Instead, authors \nexploring transition during this period concentrated on \u2018macro\u2019 or more structural \nissues such as class and gender.  It is suggested that transitions in the 1960s were \ncharacterised by individual level complexity that has largely been ignored by others \nexploring school to work transitions. \n \nKeywords: Youth transitions, young workers, risk and individualisation, Norbert \nElias. \n  4 \nIt is now well established that the way youth transitions are conceptualised has \nchanged over the last thirty years or so (Layder et al 1991; Roberts 1995; Evans and \nFurlong 1997; Lawy 2002). Evans and Furlong (1997) reflect on this change by \ndocumenting the metaphors emerging from the different theoretical approaches of the \nlast thirty years. They argue \u2018each metaphor represents ways of analysing and \nunderstanding the young person\u2019s interactions with his or her social milieu and \ntypical sequences of events between adolescence and adulthood\u2019 (Evans and Furlong \n1997: 17). For example, they suggest that youth transitions were categorised first, as \nniches in the 1960s and then pathways in the 1970s, as trajectories in the 1980s, \nbefore moving on to the more reflexive and post structuralist metaphor of navigation \nin the 1990s. In turn these metaphors have given rise to newer metaphors such as \nstructured individualisation (Nagel and Wallace 1997), and rationalised \nindividualisation (Furlong et al 2002).  \nHowever, underpinning these different metaphors is a view that the individual \nexperience of the transition has indeed changed and that the transitional experience of \ncontemporary young people is markedly different to the experiences of previous \ngenerations of youth. The implication is that school to work transitions have moved \nfrom being a mass, straightforward, linear and a \u2018single step\u2019 process (albeit mediated \nby family background, class and gender) to a complex, fragmented and individualised \nprocess dependent on the navigational and negotiating abilities of young people \n(Furlong and Cartmel 1997; Cartmel et al 2002). Whereas once young people could \nleave school, often without qualifications, now young people face uncertainty and \nhave to navigate their way through a variety of experiences and transition options, \nalways reflecting on the risks involved. Young people entering a local labour market \n  5 \nno longer share common transition experiences with others as transitions have \nbecome more individualised. \nAnalysis of the contemporary situation of young adults highlights an increasing \nfragmentation of opportunities and experience; the processes of youth are highly \ndifferentiated, reflecting and constructing social divisions in society in complex \nways\u2026As possible pathways out of school have diversified, young people have to \nfind their own ways forward and their own values in education, consumption, \npolitics, work and family life. (Evans and Furlong 1997: 33) \nThe evidence put forward to support the view that young people\u2019s transitional \nexperiences have changed usually appears in the form of drastic labour market \ntransformations (Ashton 1991; Roberts 1995, 1997), the rise in youth unemployment \n(Furlong 1993; Roberts 1997), the emergence of youth training schemes, the \nincreased availability of post-compulsory education (Furlong 1993; Roberts 1997), \nchanges in social security legislation (Pilcher 1995; Furlong and Cartmel 1997), and \nthe increased complexity (and risk) of choice (Nagel and Wallace 1997; Lawy 2002). \nHowever, with new studies collecting reflexive accounts of past transitional \nexperiences, and via the secondary analysis of historical young worker data, it has \nbecome possible to re-examine the individual transitional experience and question the \nextent to which past youth transitions were individualised and complex. For example, \nVickerstaff (2001:3) has explored the assumed linearity and uncomplicated nature of \ntransitions for post-war apprentices. In this research she has demonstrated that past \ntransitions were anything but straightforward, unproblematic or single step. For some \nof the respondents in her study, the experience of apprenticeship was unpleasant, \nviolent, fragmented and as much the result of \u2018chance\u2019 as choice. She suggests, \ncompared to contemporary transitions \n  6 \nThe range of choices may have been different, leading to a greater homogenisation \nof possible pathways and individuals may have had less expectation of being able to \ndesign their own trail but the individual still had to negotiate and manage their own \ntrajectory, whether it was of their own choosing or not. Indeed, the absence of \napparent choice might be hypothesized to have brought its own risks and dilemmas.          \n(Vickerstaff 2001: 3) \n \nUsing data from the little known project from the 1960s, this paper aims to examine \nthe complexity of past transitions and to question their assumed linearity. The \nargument offered is that previous research on youth transitions has understated the \nlevel of complexity that characterised youth transitions in the early 1960s and 1970s. \nFrom the secondary analysis of the 1960s data the individual level complexity that \nunderpinned school to work transitions is documented. For many in this study, the \ntransition process was not as smooth, uncomplicated or as linear as has been \npreviously argued. Throughout this paper the concept of a \u2018golden age\u2019 is used as a \nshorthand term to describe the post-war period (between the 1950s and the late 1960) \nwhich has been characterised by many authors as a time of mass employment and \nstraightforward school to work transitions (Vickerstaff 2003). Certainly in Leicester, \nthe focus of this paper, the 1960s was a period of excellent employment prospects for \nyoung unqualified workers with the wealth of low skilled jobs available and a low \nrate of unemployment (Pye1972: 375). However, this orthodox view of the past \nignores the fact that many local labour markets were characterised by large \nfluctuations in their buoyancy and prosperity. Even in the Leicester labour market of \nthe 1960s our data reveals that there was a fear of unemployment regardless of those \naccounts which suggest that during this \u2018golden age\u2019 jobs for school leavers were \nplentiful (Kiernan 1992; Roberts 1984, 1995; Unwin and Wellington 2001). Indeed, \n  7 \nas Pollard (1983) has argued unemployment elsewhere was substantial during this \nperiod suggesting that the young workers fears were justified. \n \n \nAdjustment of Young Workers to Work Situations \nApproaching his final year in the Department of Sociology at the University of \nLeicester, Norbert Elias was successful in applying to the Department of Scientific \nand Industrial Research (D.S.I.R) for a grant of \u00a315,000 to fund the project \n\u2018Adjustment of Young Workers to Work Situations and Adult Roles\u2019. Better know for \nbooks like The Civilising Process (1939) and What is Sociology (1970), undertaking a \nlarge-scale, government sponsored survey on youth transitions may seem something \nof a departure for Elias who tended to support his works with the secondary analysis \nof historical data. However, whilst Elias\u2019s writings on young workers remain \nunpublished and embedded within his own notes, minutes of meetings and \nmemoranda, Goodwin and O\u2019Connor (2002) and Krieken (1998) argue that the \ntransition from childhood to adulthood is closely interwoven with Elias\u2019s other \nsociological concerns. For example, Elias suggests that human beings are \n\u2018interdependent, forming figurations or networks with each other which connect the \npsychological with the social, or habitus with social relations\u2019 (Krieken, 1998: 49) \nand  \n\u2026it is the web of social relations in which individuals live during their most \nimpressionable phase, that is childhood and youth, which imprints itself upon \ntheir unfolding personality in the form of the relationship between their \ncontrolling agencies, super-ego and ego and their libidinal impulses. The \n  8 \nresulting balance\u2026determines how an individual person steers him or herself \nin his or her social relations with others\u2026 However, there is no end to the \nintertwining\u2026 (Elias, 2000: 377) \nElias conceptualised the intertwining as the inter-relationship between sociogenesis \n(the processes of development and transformation in social relations) and \npsychogenesis (transformation in habitus that accompanies such social changes) \n(Krieken 1998). In this sense habitus is not inherent but \u2018habituated\u2019 and becomes a \nconstituent part of the individual by learning through social experience. In Elias\u2019s \nwork childhood is the main \u2018transmission belt\u2019 for the development of the habitus \n(Krieken 1998; 156). The \u2018Adjustment of Young Workers to Work Situations and \nAdult Roles\u2019 can bee seen as a project through which Elias sought to gain further \nsupport for his own theorising and, therefore, has both historical and theoretical \nsignificance for those interested in his sociological enquiry. \nPicking up themes from his other writings, Elias argued that the transition from \nschool to work not only required the young person to learn new technical skills and \nthe skills required to do the job but also to make adjustments \u2018to relationships with \nolder workers, supervisors\u2026learning new codes of behaviour (Elias 1961: 1). For \nElias this transition process was not a smooth one and he speculated that many of the \nyoung people would experience difficulties, anxiety or even \u2018shock\u2019 when entering \nthe adult world of work. The reason for this is that schools do not prepare the young \npeople for adulthood or work. Elias suggested that  \nThe central problem arises from the fact that a complex society such as ours requires \ncustomarily a prolonged period of indirect preparation and training for adult life. By \nindirect I mean from the age of 5 to 14,15 or 16 the growing up children of our \nsociety are trained for their adult tasks in special institutions which we call schools, \n  9 \nwhere they learn, where they acquire the knowledge about the adult world past, \npresent and future not by direct contact with it, but largely from books. Their actual \nknowledge of the adult world, their only contacts with adults, is relatively limited \n(Young Worker Project 1962: 2)[2]. \nTo explore these issues data was collected via interviews with a sample of young \npeople drawn from the Youth Employment Office index of all Leicester school \nleavers from the summer and Christmas of 1960 and the summer and Christmas of \n1962. The target group was to include all those with one years further education. This \nsample was then further stratified by the school attended (secondary, technical, \ngrammar or other), by the size of firm entered in first job and whether they were \ntrainees or not. The sample was divided up into five sub-groups and using a table of \nrandom numbers a target sample of 1150 young people were identified. The sample is \nsummarised in table one. \n \n**Table One Here ** \n \nFrom the 1150 individuals, the research team completed 882 interviews. With the \nexception of Ashton and Field (1976) who used a sample of the cases, the bulk of the \ninterview data has never been fully analysed or published. In the mid 1970s Ashton \narchived the interview schedules, where they have remained untouched until recently, \nwhen 851 of the original interview schedules were rediscovered. \nInitial analysis of the data has revealed that the project provides a fascinating insight \ninto the individual experiences of young people during the transition from school to \n  10 \nwork during the 1960s and facilitates a re-examination of transitions made during this \nperiod.  In this paper we now go on to use the data to explore the following questions: \ni) to what extent were transitions in the 1960s \u2018non-linear\u2019, involving breaks, \nchanges of direction, extended or repeated periods of unemployment, \nfrequent moves between jobs, returns to education and training after \nlabour market participation and any unusual sequences of events (Furlong \net al 2002); \nii) To what extent were transitions in the 1960s homogenised or \ndifferentiated at the individual level; \niii) To what extent were transitions in the 1960s single-step or prolonged. \n \nFrom School to Work: Linear and Smooth or Non-linear and Complex? \nFurlong et al. (2002) reflect on transition experiences that can be defined as either \nlinear or non-linear. They suggest that linearity involves fairly smooth, \nstraightforward transitions from school to work in which there are no major breaks, \ndivergences or reversals (Furlong et al. 2002: 7). However, they note that this has \nchanged over time and once uncommon experiences, such as unemployment have \nbecome normalised. They suggest, for example,  that few young people have \nmanaged to avoid unemployment altogether and a young person now \u2018who has a short \nperiod of unemployment between leaving education and gaining a job can still be \nseen as having made a linear transition\u2019 (Furlong et al 2002: 7). Conversely, they \nargue that non-linear or complex transitions \u2018involve breaks, changes of direction and \nunusual sequences of events\u2019 (Furlong et al 2002: 8) and can include extended or \n  11 \nrepeated periods of unemployment, frequent moves between jobs and returns to \neducation and training after periods in the labour market (Furlong et al 2002: 8). \nUsing this typology, Furlong et al (2002) have successfully questioned the assumed \nnon-linearity and complexity of all contemporary transitions and argue that some \nyoung people still follow smooth and linear routes. They suggest that the routes \nyoung people take still depend, to some extent, on educational attainment, gender and \nclass, arguing that \u2018those who experience complex transition tend to be disadvantaged \neducationally and socially and are over represented in areas of deprivation\u2019 (Furlong \net al 2002: 13).  \nGiven Furlong et al\u2019s (2002) critique of the assumed non-linearity of current \ntransitions, it is possible to question the assumed linearity of past transitions using the \nsame typology. This typology implies that the transitions of the 1960s were linear and \nstraightforward involving no major breaks, divergences or reversals. It would also be \nfair to suggest that a linear transition of the past would not have involved any periods \nof unemployment or employment breaks, changes of direction, frequent moves \nbetween jobs or returns to education as, at this time, these were relatively uncommon \nexperiences.  \n \nFrequent Job Moves \nData relating to the number of jobs held immediately after leaving school and prior to \nthe interview is presented in Table 2. Usually the respondents were interviewed \nwithin one to two years of leaving school and as such the number of jobs broadly \n  12 \nrepresents the numbers of jobs held in their first two years of working life. Data on \nthe number of jobs held is presented by gender, age and education. \nAt the time of the interview the majority of the young workers were still in their first \njobs, although a sizeable group had worked in at least two jobs. Interestingly, the \nnumbers of young people who had held four or more jobs is not insignificant.  Whilst \nthe data provides no evidence of young people returning to education, this data does \nsuggest that some of the young workers did engage in frequent job moves, with many \nof those interviewed changing jobs anywhere between every month and every four to \nsix months. Indeed, taking the sample as a whole there were a small number of \nindividuals who had held between seven and eleven jobs between leaving school and \nthe time of the interview. \nThere is an important gender difference here, with girls experiencing a greater \nnumber of job changes than boys in the same period. Over 43 per cent of the girls \ninterviewed were on their second or third job and 10 per cent were on their fourth job \nor more, whilst the majority of young males were still in their first job, 37 per cent \nhad held more than one job and nearly 6 per cent had held four or more jobs. Given \nthe fact that the majority of these young workers were actually in their first year of \nemployment, for this small group it implies a job move at least every three months.  \n**Table TWO Here ** \nFrom Table 2 it appears that most young people had remained in their first job. \nHowever, of those aged 18, 16 per cent had held three jobs and nearly 10 per cent had \nheld four jobs or more. Educational experience also had an impact. The data appears \nto suggest that those young workers with less than one years education (in this sample \n  13 \nthe majority) were more likely to be on to their second or third job whilst those with a \nhigher level of education were more likely to have remained with their first employer. \nFrequent Moves and Changes of Direction \nThe changes in direction that such frequent job moves entailed are also evident in the \ndata presented in Table 3. Although not fully representative of the sample, this data \nprovides some insight into the early career histories of the school leavers interviewed \nand individual level complexities. This data is typical of many of those young \nworkers who had not remained in their first job. The data in this table is presented in \norder of job reading from right to left.  \nThe data clearly indicates that some of the young people interviewed did experience \nsignificant changes in direction during the early part of their career. For example, \nrespondent A464, aged 16 and interviewed in April 1964 had a total of seven jobs \nsince leaving school sixteen months earlier. On average this respondent changed jobs \nevery two months. He started work as a shop assistant before spending one month as \na machinist in a large boot and shoe factory. He then went to work in a crisp factory, \nreturning to boot and shoe work for three months before subsequent moves through \npositions in a plastics factory, a sweet factory and an engineering works before \nbecoming unemployed. \nRespondent E87 is similar. Aged 18 at the time of interview this respondent had held \nnine different positions in just over two years in the labour market. On average she \nstayed in each job for just under three months. She began her working life as a shop \nassistant before moving into a position as a cutter in a hosiery factory.  \n  14 \n \n**Table Three Here ** \nShe left the hosiery factory because she wanted to become a nurse and then spent six \nmonths working as a domestic assistant in a nursing home. She went on to become a \nmachinist in a boot and shoe factory. Subsequently she moved into positions as \nchambermaid, maid, groom and a hotel assistant before returning to work as a shoe \nmachinist. \nBreaks and Unemployment \nA further factor identified as being central to a linear smooth transition from school to \nwork is the absence of periods of unemployment or breaks in employment from work \nhistories. The assumption in much of the literature is that young people in the 1960s \nmoved seamlessly from school to work without a break. From the data it appears that \nmany of the young people did not experience any significant breaks in employment \nand avoided unemployment. However, this may mean that for some unemployment \nand the fear of unemployment added to the individual level complexity of their own \ntransition from school to work. Indeed, although while perhaps not the norm, \nindividuals in this study did experience breaks in employment and periods of \nunemployment.  \nThe respondent gave the impression of being very insecure.  He had 7 sisters and 4 \nbrothers, but his mother was a widower.  For the last few years of his school \ncareer, he had lived at a council home because he often played truant from school \nwhile he was living with his mother.  Since he had been out to work, he had had 7 \njobs but he was now out of work\u2026At the end of the interview, respondent \n  15 \nmentioned that he may get a job with a fair that was due to leave Leicester in the \nnext few days. (Unemployed Male 1964, A464) \n**** had a good school career, and with five passes at GCE started out with the \nintention of making a good career for himself. He was very pleased to get the \nposition with a firm of chartered accountants and felt he was on the road to \nbecoming a professionally qualified man. It came as a great shock when he was \ndismissed for having a Saturday job on a market stall. He was unemployed for five \nweeks and had to take a job simply to earn some money. (Clerk 1963, B155) \nIt also appears from the data that the fear of unemployment was a real issue for some \nof the young people. As the quotes below illustrate, a group of the respondents \nprofessed their anxieties about being unemployed when leaving school or becoming \nunemployed in the future. For some the concern was so great that they took the first \njob that they could.  \n\u2026respondent has had fears of unemployment and general economic insecurity. It \ncame out several times in the interview. As his father realised\u2026respondent has \nalso been afraid of becoming a drifter, if  not a \u201cdelinquent\u201d\u2026(Apprentice Gas \nFitter 1963, A532) \nWorried when it came to leaving school in case he didn\u2019t get a job: took the first he \ncould get because it was better than being unemployed. (Trainee Knitter 1963, \nA636) \nI used to worry that I would get the sack because I wasn\u2019t underlined. [Did any \nboys get the sack?] Oh yes. (Stock Controller 1963, C509) \nIn this study, the respondents were asked whether they had secured a job whilst they \nwere still at school or whether they secured the job after leaving school. Over 170 \n  16 \nrespondents reported that they did not secure a job until after leaving school. The \nlength of time after leaving school until they found work could vary anywhere \nbetween two and five weeks or between two and six months. This suggests that quite \na sizable group did not leave school and walk straight into a job. As the interviewer \nnotes record: \n\u2026after leaving school-  he couldn\u2019t get a job to start with so he had an uncle in \ncarpentry who took him around with him and gave him pocket money. (Motor \nMechanic 1964, A344) \nOr as a respondent suggested \nLong time after I left. Two months [didn\u2019t you have job during that time ?] No. \n(Boot and Shoe Worker 1963, A944) \nIn terms of movements between their first and second job, of those who were in their \nsecond job, 117 suggested that they have only heard about the current position after \nleaving their previous position. It is also clear that some of the young people in the \nsurvey experienced periods of unemployment. \n \nStraightforward Transitions? \nA key characteristic of non-linear transitions is the risk and uncertainty experienced \nby the young person. Again, the assumption here is that young people making school \nto work transitions in the 1960s did not experience the process as being characterised \nby risk and uncertainty. Instead it was relatively straightforward.  However the data \nfor this study suggests that some of the young people did indeed perceive the risks \nand uncertainties of life beyond the school playground and as with Vickerstaff (2001) \n  17 \nand Carter (1962), quite a large proportion of the young workers did not feel that they \nhad been prepared for entering employment for the first time. The respondents were \nasked \u2018when you were at school, what were you told about work?\u2019 \nThat it was terrible, had to work long hours. Pretty general idea that it was a \nhorrible thing to do, that nobody would ever want to leave school when been to \nwork. (Receptionist 1963, E590) \nWe had a few talks but very little really until you come to the real thing. Went on a \nfew trips but they never really told you much. (Hosiery Packer 1964, A836) \nYEO told us it wasn\u2019t as easy as it seemed to be. When at school tend to see just \npayday side - don\u2019t look into hours and how hard you have to work. (Grocery \nWorker 1964, B266) \nThat I would wish that I were back at school. (Butcher 1963, C711) \nFor many, their preparation for working life was ad hoc and was largely dependent \nupon the whims of the teachers, schools and youth employment officers. For others, \nthe mere prospect of entering employment brought with it feelings of risk and \nuncertainty. \nI had no idea what it would be like. It\u2019s like going to a new town- you just don\u2019t \nknow what it\u2019s going to be like (Trainee Electrician 1963, A536) \nI thought I\u2019d have to work quite hard- If I didn\u2019t work fast enough I\u2019d have to leave \nthe job (Shoe Worker 1964, A531) \nI was a bit frightened going into big factory and not knowing anybody, and people \nbeing older than you, - not quite sure what to expect (Knitwear Machinist 1964, \nE334) \n  18 \nDuring the first few months of work the risk and uncertainty remained for many. For \nexample, a large number of those who had left school to become apprentices \nexperienced real anxiety and a heightened sense of risk in simply getting their \napprenticeship papers actually signed. The risk for these young workers was that \nwithout the signed apprenticeship paper they could lose their job, have difficulties in \ngaining access to college, or as one respondent reported they would be \u2018mucked \nabout, the new lads are used as cheap labour\u2019 (Cabinet Maker 1963, C125). \n \n\u2026you have to push them to sign your apprenticeship\u2026[what did you do?]. You tell \nthem and they put your name down and they forget it you have to keep urging them \non and keep telling them till they get fed up and they let you go. [Is yours sorted \nout?]. Yes I keep going up and telling them, but me dad has gotta go up and see \nhim and sign them. [How soon?]. It has to be done not much before and not much \nafter 16 because your apprenticeship finishes when you\u2019re 21 1\/2 years. (Plumber \n1964, A541) \n \nThe only difficulty was getting my apprenticeship papers. It wasn\u2019t difficult getting \ninto tech but I had to go to my boss and ask about apprenticeship on a years \napproval to start with and if you are satisfactory you start apprenticeship. \u2026[what \ndid you do?]. Asked my boss\u2026 he said that at the moment the problem is getting \ninto tech. There was a meeting of apprentices with the boss and he said he could \nonly let a few go and it was a question of who\u2026the first thing I knew was a \nmember of staff coming to me with the papers and telling me to get them signed. As \nfar as I know there has only been trouble about being an apprentice. (Apprentice \nPainter and Decorator 1963, A792) \n  19 \nI was worried about my apprenticeship papers not being signed. After I had been \nthere about 9 months I went to see the boss about it. He said he would make it all \nright and he backdated the papers for me. (Apprentice Machine Minder 1963, \nA866) \n \nHomogenised or Differentiated Transition? \nA crude measure of individualization is the proportion of age peers in a person\u2019s \nsocial network with whom he or she shares a common biography having grown up in \nthe same district, attended the same schools, and entered similar types of \nemployment at the same ages. Virtually everything that every individual does and \nexperiences is still shared with many other people, but nowadays in a variety of \nindividualized sequences and combinations. (Roberts 1995:113)  \nAs suggested above, alongside the debates relating to the relative complexity of \nschool to work transitions is an assertion that transitions in the past were more \nhomogenised and less individualised. Roberts (1995) provides a useful discussion of \nthis, pointing to the shared characteristics of a homogenous transition \u2013 same \nbiography, similar education, growing up in the same area and entering similar types \nof employment. \nThe relative homogeneity of transitions can also be explored using the Adjustment of \nYoung Workers data. During the interviews the young workers were asked two \nquestions that could be used as broad indicators of the homogeneity thesis. First, the \nyoung workers were asked \u2018did anyone else you know have the same sort of jobs as \nyou?\u2019. Such a question touches upon Roberts\u2019 notions of individuals sharing a \ncommon biography, growing up in the same area, attending the same schools and \n  20 \nentering the same types of employment as the question is specifically directed at the \nrespondent\u2019s relatives, friends and neighbours. Likewise, the same \u2018type\u2019 of \nemployment that Roberts refers to is also captured in this question as the question \ndeals with types of jobs rather than dealing with specific employers. The second \nquestion deals with the latter issue by asking the respondents \u2018was there anyone you \nknew working in the same firm?\u2019. The data relating to these two questions is \npresented in Table 4. \n**Table Four Here ** \nFrom Table 4 it is clear that approximately fifty per cent young workers in 1960s \nLeicester may not have made the homogenised transitions suggested by authors such \nas Roberts. For example, forty nine percent of the respondents suggested that they did \nnot work in the same sort of job as their friends or relatives. Although such a question \nmay under represent the ability of respondents to fully differentiate between types of \njobs in terms of their \u2018similarities\u2019 such as working conditions and rewards and \nshould be treated with some caution, the findings do suggest that past transitions may \nnot have been as homogenous as previously thought. Likewise, the fact that fifty two \npercent of the respondents indicated that they did not know anybody working in the \nsame firm raises questions about the extent to which biographies were shared by \nthose growing up in the same area. \nSingle-step or Prolonged Transitions? \nVickerstaff  (2001) argues that earlier studies assume that transitions in the 1950s and \n1960s were \u2018single step\u2019. It is suggested that the buoyancy of the labour market in the \nearly 1960s enabled young people to make a direct and single-step transition from \nschool to work. Once the young people had entered work, they tended to leave home, \n  21 \nachieve some state of financial independence, marry and have children in a relatively \nshort period of time, making what Coles (1995) has called three interrelated \ntransitions; from school to work, from family of origin to family of destination and \nfrom childhood home to independent living. This pattern was particularly true for the \nworking class (Jones 1995, Furlong and Cartmel 1997), with working class youth \nmore likely to become economically independent earlier than middle class youth \n(Pilcher 1995). \nHowever, forty years later it has become widely accepted that youth transitions are \nnow extended and more diversified with young people remaining dependent on their \nfamilies for a longer period of time (Roberts 1995, 1997; Furlong and Cartmel 1997; \nPilcher 1995; Lawy 2002). The protracted transition from school to work has left \nyoung people remaining dependent on the family and state for longer (Pilcher 1995; \nFurlong and Cartmel 1997; Lawy 2002) as the possibility of early financial \nindependence has become more remote. Furlong and Cartmel (1997) also suggest that \ndomestic and housing transitions have become more complex. Explanations for such \nextended transitions range from labour market restructuring, the rise of youth \nunemployment, changes in social welfare legislation, and the increased numbers of \nyoung people staying on in education, either because of limited employment \nopportunities or because of family pressure.  \nThere is little evidence to suggest that the young workers in Leicester were \nprolonging their transitional experience by staying on in education, as the vast \nmajority left school at the first opportunity. Indeed, instead of family pressure to stay \nin education, there was a great deal of pressure from family and friends to leave \neducation as soon as possible. Yet the single step hypothesis, relating to past \n  22 \ntransitions, is questionable when one considers the data relating to dependence on the \nfamily, financial independence and housing transitions. \nOne characteristic of independence or self-responsibility, we suggest, would be the \nability of the young people to make decisions about their own futures and resolve any \ndifficulties that arose in work or life. However, many of the young people interviewed \nin the young worker project still relied heavily on family members in obtaining work \nor in resolving difficulties of conflicts at work. \n \n\u2026 The forewoman has to sign the ticket if you make your own price out - she \nsigned the ticket and I sent them down then swore blind she hadn't signed them. My \nDad went up because they'd accused me of putting the tickets in which I \ndidn't\u2026(Shoe Worker 1964, D989) \nFather went to see Mr ****** and the Station Master and it was settled by them. \n(British Rail Messenger 1964, A237)  \nWe started at Tech for one year and then he stopped us going the following year. \nMy father got the TU in and the secretary went to see the boss. [Father]  got it so \nthat we shall carry on at Tech next September. (Apprentice Compositor 1964, \nC693)  \n[Have you had any difficulties in this job?] Not really - if I have, I talked to mother \nor people at work, e.g. problems with tax. (Stockman 1963, Pilot Survey) \nIn these examples, the young workers did not attempt to resolve their difficulties \nthemselves or display independent behaviour. Instead they relied heavily on the \ninterventions of family members. There are other examples in the data where parents \nintervene in obtaining employment, getting apprenticeship papers signed, negotiating \n  23 \npay and even helping the employers to discipline the young workers. When asked \nhow they got to know about their first job, such responses were typical: \nMy dad got the job for me. My dads in the job and I\u2019ve been interested in it since I \nwas at school. (Apprentice Joiner 1963, A821) \nDad got me the job. At least he got me the interview, which I had to go to. Dad \nworks for the gas board. (Apprentice Fitter 1964, A776) \nMy mum used to work there and they said I could have a job if I wanted it. \n(Machinist 1964, D52) \nThe influence of personal networks was extremely important amongst this sample and \nmany of the young workers did indicate that their parents, siblings and members of \ntheir wider family network had helped them to find their first jobs. Friends were also \nimportant sources of information about workplace vacancies. This pattern of \nobtaining employment through personal contacts has been noted in other studies and \ncan perhaps be attributed more to strong community ties (Grieco 1987) than to \ndependence on family. However, we would argue that this pattern, combined with the \ntendency of the young workers to talk over problems at work with their parents, was \nan indicator that the important transitional step of \u2018disengaging \u2018 with their families \nof origin  (Hubbard 2000) had not been made. \nThe single step hypothesis is also questionable in terms of economic independence. \nWhen asked what happened to their wages, the data reveals that far from being \ndomestically and financially independent fewer than half the respondents kept the \nmoney themselves. Rather than paying a certain amount of board and lodging as if \nthey had moved to alternative accommodation, many had to pass their wage packet to \ntheir mother or to share it equally with her or, for a small number, give it to their \n  24 \nfather.  Their parents would then allocate a small proportion of the pay packet to the \nchild as \u2018pocket money\u2019. For many their own money was not spent on the pursuit of \nan independent life style but on \u2018sweets\u2019, \u2018going out\u2019 and buying clothes, records and \ncigarettes. \nI have \u00a31 she has the rest- she buys my food and clothes out of that. It\u2019s better than \nif I kept her and gave her board, she\u2019d want my packet and everything else besides. \nSo at moment better to give it to her. (Audit Clerk 1963, B27) \nI get \u00a37 and bring home \u00a36-11 according to tax and I give it to her and she gives \nme \u00a32-15 spending money. (Mechanic 1964, C356) \nGive it all to her [mother] and she gives me spending money - about a \u00a31 and if I \nwant something (Hand Finisher 1963, E476) \nFor a start until my 17th birthday gave Mother all my wages and she gave me \nspending money. Started paying board at 17. Now has \u00a32 a week. (Typist 1963, \nE386) \nThese quotes suggest that the young workers had not financially \u2018disengaged with \ntheir family of origin\u2019 (Hubbard 2000:9.7) and illustrate the way in which the young \nworkers to some extent remained financially dependent upon their parents. Equally, \nin some families the parents were finically dependent on the young worker and relied \nupon their wages as essential family income, supporting parents, siblings and other \nrelatives. \nRespondent has morning paper round and keeps this for pocket money. (Mechanic \n1963, A303) \nMother explains that she keeps the money and gives him what he needs as he is not \nresponsible with money. (Warehouse Man 1963, A372) \n  25 \nJones (1995) has argued that historically young workers made the transition to \ndomestic independence soon after beginning full time paid work, however, domestic \nor housing transitions were not a feature of the young workers lives. These young \nworkers had neither financially disengaged with their families of origin, nor \ndisengaged domestically, either by leaving home to live independently or by \nbecoming part of a family of destination. Certainly none of the respondents had made \na housing transition; all of the interviews were undertaken in the family home where \nthe respondents continued to live, despite the fact that many were aged eighteen or \nover and three had already married.  \n \n \nConclusion  \nIn this article we have attempted to demonstrate the complexity of past school to \nwork transitions via a secondary analysis of data from the 1960s. Despite assertions \nthat past school to work transitions were single step, simple and homogenous, data \nfrom the Adjustment of Young Workers to Work Situations and Adult Roles project \nprovides clear evidence of frequent job moves (often to very different job roles and \ndifferent industries), with many young people having four or more jobs within the \nfirst year or so of employment. The findings also question the assumed seamless \ntransition from school to work as it appears that transitional experiences during this \ntime period were not straightforward. The data reveals that many of the young \nworkers already felt disillusioned with work and were anxious about their future \nprospects or concerned about their lack of training. Some of the young people had \nexperienced periods of unemployment either before entering work or between jobs. \nThe young people interviewed also clearly felt increased levels of insecurity (and \n  26 \nrisk) brought on by being out of work, or when threatened by unemployment. \nLikewise, the view that young people in the past made homogenised transitions to \nwork, sharing the same experiences with friends, neighbours and relatives is also \nproblematic. For example, over half of the sample interviewed here clearly had \nindividualised experiences entering different firms at different times during the first \nyears of their working life. The data also suggests that many of the young people in \nthis survey had not made the step of disengaging with the family of origin and \nconsequently they remained very dependent on their parents and family for housing, \nmoney and decision making long after they had made the transition from school to \nwork. \n \nHowever, there are also three broader conclusions that can be drawn from our \nanalyses. First, whilst most authors agree that youth transitions have moved away \nfrom a process that is linear and smooth or uncomplicated to a process that is both \nnon-linear and complex or problematic, many authors have merely confirmed an \nestablished view about the past. Indeed, as Furlong et al (2002) and Vickerstaff \n(2001) suggest, the consensus view on the changing nature of transitions, from liner \nand smooth to non-linear and complex, has largely remained unchallenged. Given the \nindividual level complexity uncovered in the transitional experiences outlined above, \none has to question why this is. Why have ideas relating to the \u2018golden age\u2019 of \nemployment and notions of smooth transitions remained unquestioned? Moreover, \nwhy did sociologists at the time choose not to highlight the complexities contained \nwithin the data? These can perhaps be explained perhaps by the changing nature of \nthe theoretical and methodological approaches to transitions over the last few years, \nas outlined above. This conceptual shift from exploring the impact of social structure \n  27 \nto the more contemporary individualised approaches actually means that in \nconceptual terms we are not comparing like for like when we compare current and \ntransitional experiences of forty years ago. To put it simply, those currently involved \nin trying to understand transitions have become concerned with different phenomenon \nand have different academic pre-occupations. Past scholars were not looking for the \nindividualised, subjective, complex transitional experience and the over-\nconcentration on macro process as being central determinants of the transitional \nprocess meant that the individual experiences were largely ignored or hidden in a \nbroader analysis. For example, in Ashton and Field (1976) the over riding concern \nwas to explore how an individual\u2019s social and educational experience led to a \ncontinuity of experiences at work. Likewise, the dominant structural view of the \n1980s viewed labour market destinations as being determined by social forces outside \nthe control of individuals. Evans and Furlong (1997:18) suggest that, with the \ncollapse of the youth labour market, transition experiences were explained \u2018more in \nterms of structural forces such as social class, race, gender, educational attainment \nand labour market conditions rather than by reference to individual characteristics or \naspirations\u2019.  \nA related conclusion, therefore, must be that a secondary analysis of old sociological \ndata and the re-reading of classic studies is both worthwhile and insightful. Being \nable to interrogate historical data with contemporary ideas and concepts has obvious \nvalue and can change (or contribute to) previous understandings of the social world \n(Roberts 1997). However, with the exception of Vickerstaff (2001) and the current \nstudy, the value of applying and exploring contemporary notions and ideas against the \ntransition experiences of youth for previous generations, and questioning the assumed \nlinearity has not been considered.  \n  28 \n \nFinally, and again a related conclusion, is that the interrogation of historical \nsociological data facilitates reflection on the adequacy of contemporary theories and \ndebates. For example, this data does question aspects of the youth, risk and \nindividualisation debates so dominant since the publication of Beck\u2019s Risk Society \n(1992). When Beck locates the problems of risk and individualisation in late \nmodernity there is an assumption that the experiences of young people during this \ntime are essentially different to the experiences of those who have gone before and \nthe notion of late modernity implies a unique time period separate from other epochs \n- what Furlong and Cartmel (1997) refer to as the \u2018epistemological fallacy of late \nmodernity\u2019. Again the data presented above challenges this assumption. Past \ntransitional experiences were not uniformly simple, linear or as single step as \npreviously suggested and many transitions were characterised by individual level \ncomplexities similar to those of contemporary youth. This is not to suggest that all \npast transitions were \u2018individualised\u2019 but more simply that the past could be a \ncomplex, risky and problematic place for young people making the transition from \nschool to work. Given Elias\u2019s (1987) assertion that \u2018one cannot ignore the fact that \npresent society has grown out of earlier societies\u2019 (Elias 1987:226), the past cannot be \nignored and it needs to be re-interrogated. \n  29 \nAcknowledgements \nWe are grateful to the young worker research team and to the Norbert Elias \nFoundation for allowing us to quote from the archived Elias papers.

Given that young people had limited knowledge of work, he \nargued, they had to rely on fantasies that invariably differed from the realities of \nwork. The shock hypothesis now has limited credibility now in the study of youth \ntransitions with many suggesting that young people do have a clear idea of what work \nwill be like before they arrive. For example, a number of authors have identified the \n\u2018anticipatory socialisation\u2019 or \u2018cultural apprenticeships\u2019 that many working class \nyoung people go through as a preparation for working life (see Cohen 1984; Griffin \n1985; Penn 1995: Fuller and Unwin 2002) and, as such, many young people did have \nrealistic expectations of working life. \n  \n \n \nReferences \n \n  30 \nAshton, D.N and Lowe, G.
