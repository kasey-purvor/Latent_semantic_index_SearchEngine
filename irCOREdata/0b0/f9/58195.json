[2009], \nHatheway & Doyle [2009], Yu et al. [2009] and Sayre & Bulbulkaya [2009]) and mineral exploitation (Brooks \net al. [2009], Culshaw et al. [2009], Clarke et al. [2009], Devleeschouwer [2009], Devleeschouwer et al. [2009], \nDonnelly et al. [2009], Ferreira et al. [2009], Gorog & Torok [2009], Heitfield et al. [2009], Konstantopoulou & \nHayiou [2009], Maximovich [2009], Sherman & Partington [2009] and West & Cho [2009]). Few papers \ndirectly dealt with current climate change research, exceptions being: Dixon et al. (2009), Glendinning et al. \n(2009) and Rees et al. (2009). Other relevant publications include: Fookes & Lee (2007) and British Geological \nSurvey (2007).  \n \nIt might be argued that investigation of the impacts of industrialization dates back to 1966 and the Aberfan \ndisaster. Thus, it took at least a century for the effects of industrialization to form an integral part of \nenvironmental and engineering research. This time-scale is not available for monitoring, modelling and \nmilitating against the effects of climate change (Barton [2009] and Meehl et al. [2000]). Furthermore, the effects \nof climate change are not directly comparable with those of industrialization. Although past climate change gives \nan indication of the potential consequences of climate change, for example rates and potential magnitude of sea-\nlevel rise (Kim & Yang [2009]), it is difficult to constrain the geological evidence (for example, Forster et al. \n[2009]). One of the key legacies of research associated with post-industrialization has been the development of \nincreasingly sophisticated monitoring techniques; for example, the radar interferometry techniques described by \nBirch & Warren (2009) and Culshaw et al. (2009). These technologies are considered an invaluable feedback for \ncurrent and future research in all areas of engineering geology, including those related to climate change. \n \nTwo of the papers reported on continuing research into the effects of climate change (Dixon et al. [2009], \nGlendinning et al. [2009]). The keynote address outlined aspects of modelling that are being undertaken in the \ncontext of effects of climate change (Rees et al. [2009]). Barton (2009), reviewed the predictions for climate \nchange with reference to the IPPC Third Assessment report. Given the urgency that results from the rate of \nclimate change (Barton [2009], Meehl et al. [2000], IPCC [2007a]) the authors were of the opinion that a review \nof what climate change will mean for practicing engineering geologists would be a beneficial contribution to the \nCongress Proceedings. Since the Congress, the issue of climate change has become much more widely \nrecognised, as highlighted in the recently published United Nations Environment Programme report (UNEP \n[2007]). \n \nGriffiths & Culshaw (2004) identified that one way to ensure the future development of engineering geology, as \nan independent subject in the UK, would be to ensure the continuance of a thriving research culture. This paper \nsuggested that the components of engineering geology identified by Waltham (2002) form a good basis upon \nwhich to subdivide engineering geology in the context of identifying potential research areas. These categories \nalso form a convenient structure within which to consider potential impacts of climate change on engineering \ngeology practice. The components identified were: \n\uf0b7 Ground materials and structures \n\uf0b7 Regional characteristics \n\uf0b7 Surface processes and materials \n\uf0b7 Ground investigations \n\uf0b7 Material properties \n\uf0b7 Difficult ground conditions \nTo this the authors of this paper have added: \n\uf0b7 the role of engineering geology in climate change mitigation, adaptation and polity development; \n\uf0b7 contaminant transport processes (following the suggestion of Griffiths & Culshaw (2004, p. 4)) \u201cif \n\u2018environmental geology\u2019 is to be correctly regarded as a part of engineering geology\u201d,the underpinning \nrequirement for sustainability demands increased cross-cutting collaboration. \n \nCLIMATE CHANGE \nEvidence for climate change comes from a variety of disciplines. Broadly, it is driven by an increased energy \ninput to the global system. Energy inputs include, firstly, heat trapping as a consequence of increases in carbon \ndioxide resulting in lower reflection of solar energy; secondly, ozone layer depletion allows more incoming solar \nenergy radiation; and thirdly, increased solar energy radiation as a consequence of reductions in particle haze \n(Barton, in press; IPCC, 2007a). Changes to these factors are described in terms of radiative forcing (IPCC \n2007a), a numerical descriptor of the impacts on global warming (positive values) and cooling (negative values). \nThe rate of increase in radiative forcing during the industrial period is much greater than any increase in over 10 \n000 years (IPCC 2007a). The radiative forcing due to carbon dioxide, alone, increased by 20% between 1995 \nand 2005. The radiative forcing from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide \ntogether over the industrial period is +2.30 W m-2 (IPCC 2007a). Other factors that affect radiative forcing, \ninclude land cover, which affects surface albedo and ozone concentrations in the stratosphere and troposphere. \nAerosols in the atmosphere have a cooling effect: a direct radiative forcing of -0.5 W m-2 and an indirect forcing \n(cloud albedo) of-0.7 W m - 2. The key driver is the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide and other \natmospheric gases. \n \nAtmospheric gas concentrations have been directly measured since about the 1960s. Geochemical evidence of \ngas concentration is also gained by measuring gas concentrations in ice cores.. IPCC (2007a) reported that the \nconcentration of carbon dixoide, methane and nitrous oxide (greenhouse gases) have all increased since the \ncommencement of the Industrial Revolution in Britain (Table 1). Despite increased consciousness of the need for \nsustainability, the rate of increase in concentration of carbon dioxide has actually been greater in the past 10 \nyears (1995\u20132005 average: 1.9 ppm per year) than that since continuous direct atmospheric measurements \nstarted (1960\u20132005 average: 1.4 ppm per year) (IPCC 2007a). In contrast to carbon dioxide, the rate of growth in \nmethane concentrations has reduced in the past approximately 15 years (IPCC 2007a). Table 1 shows the likely \ncauses of increase of these gases as reported by IPCC (2007a). \n \nTable 1. Increases in greenhouse gas concentrations and major sources \nGas Pre-Industrial \nconcentration \n2005 \nconcentration \nPercentage increase Major sources  \nCarbon \ndioxide \n280 ppm 379 ppm3 35% Fossil fuel \nLand use change \nMethane 715 ppb 1774 ppb 148% Fossil fuel \nAgriculture \nRelative contribution from various \nsources not well defined \nNitrous \noxide \n270 ppb 319 ppb 18% Agriculture  \n \nGeologists have shown that changes in greenhouse gas concentration are not solely due to anthropogenic effects.. \nGriffiths & Pedley (1995) suggested that gas bubbles trapped within Arctic, Antarctic and Greenland ice-cores \ndocument a significant increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels between the last glacial maximum, when \nconcentrations were in the order of 180-200 ppmv, and the late Holocene, when concentrations were in the order \nof 270ppmv. Forster et al. (2009) referred to the major climate changes associated with the glacial period. \nFookes & Lee (2007) reviewed some natural causes of climate change in the past, including variations in the \nearth\u2019s orbit, ocean currents, and volcanic eruptions. \n \nSOURCES FOR CLIMATE CHANGE SCENARIO \nFORECASTS \nTo predict the effect of climate change on matters relevant to engineering geology, it is necessary to understand \nthe potential impacts of climate change. Information on predicted climate change scenarios can be found in \nTable 2, some of which were listed by Hulme & Turnpenny (2004). Of these, UKCIP has a useful web site that \npresents a summary of both baseline climate datasets and future climate scenario datasets. Carbon dioxide \ndeterminations measured at the Mauna Loa station, Hawaii, USA (Bacastow et al. 1985) provide another useful \ndataset (the longest continuous record of carbon dioxide concentrations in the world) and are representative of \nglobal carbon dioxide trends, showing an increase from 315.83 ppm in 1959 to 362.57 ppm in 1996. Climate \nchange scenarios and the secondary impacts such as increased flooding or decreased river flow vary for different \npart of the world. IPCC (2007b) summarised typical impacts for each continent including what might happen to \necosystems, economies and health etc.. Table 3 is largely derived from IPCC (2007b) and lists the anticipated \nchanges to climate and some secondary impacts of potential relevance to engineering geology. \nTable 2.

The magnitude of these effects is forecast by down-scaling from global \ncirculation modelling (GCMs) such as those run by the Hadley Centre (Hulme & Turnpenny 2004, Prudhomme \net al. 2003). Key areas of uncertainty remain in modelling possible changes in extratropical (mid-Atlantic) and \ntropical storm activity; and in the Pacific climate modelling (Meehl et al., 2000). There is considerable debate \nregarding the preferred method of downscaling, examples of which include: dynamical downscaling, statistical \ndownscaling and stochastic weather generators (Prudhomme et al., 2003). The possible longer term cooling \nresulting from the collapse of thermohaline circulation (THC) has been modelled using coupled atmosphere-\nocean GCM models and has been shown to be sensitive to the rates of greenhouse gas forcing, but indicates a \nreduction in the strength of the THC . However, the collapse of the THC can be forced by injecting large \namounts of fresh water into the North Atlantic (Hulme 2003).  \nTable 1.

Engineering geologists will require an increased awareness of regional-scale \nforecasts for groundwater levels, rainfall intensity, temperature ranges and wind loadings. Also, there will need \nto be an increasing awareness of the extremes, for example, in some areas, groundwater levels are likely to \nfluctuate over a greater range and seasonality is likely to become more extreme. For existing structures, \nconsideration will need to be given to their inability to cope with increases in the occurrence of extreme events, \nfor example flooding as a consequence of overloading of surface water drainage schemes, many of which have \nbeen stretched to their full potential as a consequence of urban development. An additional complication is that \nhigher energy levels during storm events will have the potential to mobilise larger sediment loads, which will \nfurther affect the capacity of drainage systems. Within the context of this paper it has not been possible to fully \ndevelop all of the potential scenarios; instead, a broad overview and indicator of the potential impacts has been \npresented with examples of more specific case studies from the literature. As a starting point, a number of \npotential impacts of climate change on ground response have been tabulated inTable 4. \n \nTable 4. Some possible ground responses to climate change. \n \nGround response Potential impact Examples Consequence \nChanges in stress \nconditions \nChanges in material \nproperties, including \nstrength, durability and \npermeability. \nReduction in strength in areas with \nhigher rainfall or more intense \nrainfall events due to changes in \nstress conditions; increased \npermeability and loss of durability \ndue to weathering. \nMore landslides in areas with \nincreased rainfall; questioning \nof validity of empirically \nderived foundation design. \nChanges in stress \nconditions \nFluctuations in \ngroundwater conditions. \nGreater seasonality of groundwater \nlevels, periods of intense wetting \nand surface water ponding. \nImplications for settlement as a \nconsequence of groundwater \nlowering; coastal instability; \ncollapse in collapsible ground; \nincreased depth of unsaturated \nzone may open up more \nground gas migration \npathways. \nChanges in stress \nconditions \nEarthquake activation by \nglaciers melting and rises \nin sea level. \n  \nChanges in stress \nconditions \nContinental slope failure \nresulting from gas hydrate \nreleases. \n  \nChanges in stress \nconditions \nFault reactivation in \nresponse to changing \ngroundwater regimes. \n  \nWeathering \nprocesses \nChange in type and rate of \nweathering. \nGreater seasonality and more \nchemical weathering in warmer \n\/wetter areas; greater occurrence of \nefflorescent minerals. \nChanges to weathering \nprofiles; surface collapse - for \nexample due to dissolution or \ndecalcification; potential \nimpacts on vegetation and \nsurface erosion. \nWeathering \nprocesses \nChanges in material \nproperties, including \nstrength, durability and \npermeability. \nDevelopment of hardpans,.  \nWeathering \nprocesses \nChanges to geochemical \nenvironment of \nconstruction materials. \nChanging oxidation\/ reduction and \npH conditions \nPotential impact on \nconstruction materials due to \nchemical aggressiveness. \n \nWeathering \nprocesses \nShrinkage problems in \ncohesive strata. \n Settlement of existing \ndevelopment on spread \nfoundations, potential need for \ndeeper foundations for new \nbuild. \n \nThese ground responses and their impacts on engineering practice are considered in the following sections. \nGROUND MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES \nGriffiths & Culshaw (2004) suggested that the term ground materials covers the description and composition of \nrocks, whilst structures covers faults and folds. They identified two areas of importance to engineering \ngeologists:  \n\uf0b7 understanding and estimating the behaviour of rocks in relation to changes in stress;  \n\uf0b7 how the chemical composition of a rock can alter its engineering behaviour. \nBoth of these may be impacted on by climate change (Table 4). The latter is considered under weathering \n(below).  \n \nFundamental to the understanding of soil mechanics is the understanding of the behaviour of soils and rocks \nsubject to changes in stress. Climate change is likely to result in changes to pore pressures. Under wet conditions \npore pressures rise and effective stress falls. Drier localities may be subject to lower pore pressures and higher \neffective stress conditions. However, due to the anticipated increased intensity of rainfall events, even places that \nmay be drier overall, may experience rapid increases in pore water pressure and, consequential, rapid decreases \nin effective stress. Table 4 incorporates a number of the potential implications of changes in stress conditions. It \nis noted that current approaches to foundation design rely upon empirical methods, for example, the derivation of \nbearing capacity factors in cohesive soil (Nc) for use in the design of spread and piled foundations, adhesion \nfactors derived from the ratio of undrained shear strength to effective overburden pressure and angles of shearing \nresistance derived from standard penetration test determined N-values (Tomlinson 1995). If climate change \neffects significant changes in stress conditions, engineering geologists will need to give closer attention to the \napplicability of empirical methods to longer-term engineering solutions. \n \nSmaller developments, typically constructed on marginal ground conditions, are most vulnerable, for example: \n\uf0b7 structures designed to bear into sand above the water table that are subject to rising ground water levels \nexperience settlement as a consequence of the removal of fine particles from the soil; \n\uf0b7 settlement of structures bearing onto silts or clays, as a consequence of lowering of groundwater levels \nin inland areas; and  \n\uf0b7 settlement resulting from more extreme fluctuations in groundwater levels. Structures associated with \ninfrastructure in estuarine environments could be particularly vulnerable to this type of settlement. \nGround improvement techniques (Serridge2009) are also designed using empirical techniques. These types of \nfoundation are often used for smaller developments in ground considered unsuitable for spread foundations and, \ntherefore, marginal for development. The empirical approaches that are adopted are modified using recognised \nfactors of safety. Although empirical methods and factors of safety have been employed reliably for nearly a \ncentury, consideration should be given to whether design criteria need to be modified to reflect the potential \nuncertainty and, therefore, decreased safety factors associated with climate change. An example is the use of \nground improvement techniques in estuarine environments where future rises in groundwater levels may reduce \nthe passive resistance afforded by alluvial soils to stone columns. \n \nAs a result of flooding, particularly in urban environments, an increasing number of sites will be subject to \nrelatively prolonged periods of ponded water. This has a potential to affect drainage systems associated with all \ntypes of structures but, in particular, retaining structures, pavements and foundations with a consequent potential \ndecrease in the durability of existing structures and landfill sites in vulnerable areas. \nREGIONAL CHARACTERISTICS \nGriffiths & Culshaw (2004) reiterated the importance of the plate tectonic paradigm in explaining regional \ngeological characteristics and the location of earthquakes and volcanoes. Naturally unstable environments are on, \nor near, plate boundaries (Waltham 2002). Engineering geologists address the engineering implications of \nconstruction in earthquake zones (for example, liquefaction potential, active fault movements, landsliding, \ntransitory, high pore-water pressures) and on the margins of volcanoes (identifying the high-risk areas, tracking \npaths of explosive or poisonous gases, locating lava tubes, providing routeways for evacuation, presence of \ninterlayers). Climate change has the potential to extend unstable environments as exemplified in the examples \nbelow. Although these types of studies are in the early stages, it is important that the results are fed into \npredictive models to enable mitigating measures to be scheduled in those regions that may be affected. \n \nDraining ice-dammed lakes has triggered earthquakes in Norway and Basle, Switzerland (Becker, et al., 2002). \nThis suggests a potential for triggering of earthquakes in locations subject to very rapid increases in sea level \nfrom glacier melting. It has also been reported that \u2018glacial earthquakes\u2019 occur in Greenland in response to \nsudden movements of glaciers (Ekstrom et al., 2006). Similarly, changes in stress regimes brought about by \nunloading associated with glacier wasting and loading associated with rising sea levels also offer the potential to \ntrigger fault reactivation, with consequential impacts on slope-stability.  \n \nGunn et al. (2002) and Maslin et al. (2004) have identified the release of gas hydrates as a trigger for \ncontinental-slope failures. Gas hydrates are suspected to make a significant contribution to climate change; for \nexample, releases of methane hydrates and consequential climatic change over the past 450 000 years have been \ncorrelated with periods of continental shelf instability in the North Atlantic by Maslin et al. (2004). The hydrates \ncomprise a solid consisting of water with methane gas, which is stable in the high pressure, low temperature \nconditions found in a zone that extends to a few hundred metres below the sea floor of the continental margins \n(Hornbach et al. 2004 and Gunn et al., 2002). The stable depth for hydrates is limited by increasing temperatures \nwith depth and, as a consequence, a free-gas zone forms at the base of the hydrates, which are vulnerable to \nclimate change. Hornbach et al. (2004) have suggested that the thickness of the free-gas zone is controlled by \nreleases via fault slips through the overlying sediment. Gunn et al. (2002) have been studying the implications of \ngas-hydrate contributions to slope instability during earthquakes by designing laboratory experiments to examine \nhow the pressure-temperature history of gas-hydrates alters the geophysical properties of the sediment column as \na consequence of the disruption of metastable cements, or increased pore-pressures. Submarine instability can be \nsignificant both in the generation of tsunamis and, also, in the mobilisation of sediment and the potential for \ndamage to cables and pipelines on the sea-bed (Forster et al. 2009). \nSURFACE PROCESSES AND MATERIALS \nEngineering geologists consider material properties in terms of strength, deformability, durability and \npermeability and the boundaries between them. Material response to climate changes can be anticipated (Table \n4) and the engineering geologist should be aware of these responses. In areas with higher rainfall or more intense \nrainfall events, changes could include: reduction in strength and durability and changes to permeability (either \nincreased permeability due to greater weathering and erosion, or lower permeability due to cementation as a \nconsequence of solutes precipitating, or soil swelling). In areas where temperatures are increasing, changes could \ninclude: increased shear strength; increased durability and possible reduction in permeability due to hardpans \nresulting from evaporation. Engineering geology practice will need to embrace consideration of such impacts, \nwhich will vary considerably between regions and will reflect specific geological formation response to \nchanging conditions. For example, as recharge conditions change in response to changes in precipitation and \nevaporation, there will be consequential changes in geochemical conditions (Table 5 and below), with \nconsequential aggressiveness to construction materials such as concrete and steel. Another example is the \ngrowing focus on the unsaturated zone, an area of research historically left to agriculturalists and pedologists, \nwhere rising temperatures (reducing viscosity) and increased intensity of rainfall render understanding of the \nunsaturated zone increasingly important in a number of areas. These include: slope stability assessments, \ndispersed contaminants and aquifer vulnerability modelling and the understanding and protection of agricultural \nsoils, another area that is being seen as increasingly important in the context of sustainability and urban \ndevelopment. \n \nCategories considered within the following sections are: \n\uf0b7 weathering and engineering soils \n\uf0b7 floodplains and alluvium \n\uf0b7 coastal processes \n\uf0b7 inland flooding \n\uf0b7 landslides \nWeathering and engineering soils \nWeathering is the breakdown and\/or decomposition of rocks by physical (wind, rain, temperature changes, \nplants), chemical (solution, chemical changes) and biological (primarily bacteriological) processes. Table 5 lists \nsome of the ways climate change could impact the various weathering mechanisms. Interactions between these \nprocesses (Chorley et al. 1984) will increase the complexity of the impacts. Chemical weathering accelerates in \nmoister, warmer areas and accelerates further with increased biological activity but decreases where moisture is \nreduced. Clearly, an understanding of how weathering may be affected by the anticipated climate change of a \nregion will allow predictions of likely changes to weathering profiles. This may impact on a number of \nprocesses, such as hillslope processes and aggressiveness to construction materials (Table 4). \n \nTable 5. Some of the potential impacts of climate change on weathering processes. \n \nWeathering \nprocess \nLikely impacts of \ntemperature change \nLikely impacts of changes in \nprecipitation \nChanges due to other effects \nThermal \nexpansion \nIncrease as temperatures \nincrease (assuming diurnal \ntemperature changes \nincrease). \nMay be exacerbated by \nincrease in desert areas  \n Increased surface erosion by more \nintense rainfall events may \nincrease potential depth of \nweathering \nFreeze-thaw Decrease as temperatures \nincrease \nProbable overall decrease  \n May be potential for increased \naeolian activity in areas subject to \nwasting ice sheets if once stable air \nmasses are disrupted by \ntemperature changes \nPressure release   May increase in areas where \nclimate change leads to greater \nWeathering \nprocess \nLikely impacts of \ntemperature change \nLikely impacts of changes in \nprecipitation \nChanges due to other effects \nerosion. \nThere will be pressure release \nassociated with glacier wasting \nwhich could ultimately result in \ncambering in some deglaciated \nareas \nHydraulic \naction \nIncreased hydraulic action in \nareas subject to the impacts \nof wasting glaciers.  \nIncreased hydraulic action in areas \nsubject to increased intensity of \nrainfall, locally resulting in \nincreased rates of toppling failure \nas well as surface erosion \nIncreased intensity of rainfall \noffers the potential for more \noxygenating conditions. Potential \nfor mobilisation of cave deposits \ncurrently resisting dissolutional \nprocesses \nDissolution Likely increase as \ntemperatures increase \nLikely increase as precipitation \nincrease \nIncreased partial pressures of \ncarbon dioxide may affect pH. \nIncreased biological activity offers \nthe potential to exacerbate this \nprocess. By contrast controls on \nindustrial emissions may reduce \natmospheric pH.  \nDecalcification  Increased intensity of rainfall will \nfacilitate increased rates of \ndecalcification in tills, which are \nlikely to be subject to increased \ndepths of seasonal changes in \nmoisture content. \nIncreased biological activity likely \nto impact on this \nHydrolysis Potential for greater impact \nin warmer conditions \n Increases in weathering will result \nin greater volumes of suspended \nsediments (clay minerals) \nLeaching  Potential for increased \ndissolution of salts such as \ngypsum and of limestone \nand tufa \n Increases in atmospheric carbon \ndioxide in conjunction with \nincreased biological activity will \nencourage karst processes \nOxidation\/ \nreduction \n Inland flooding may extend areas \nof reducing conditions. Increased \nintensity of rainfall may increase \ndepths of oxidation processes. \n \nCrystallisation Potential for efflorescent \nminerals to extend beyond \ndesert environments \n If associated with periods of \nintense rainfall will seasonally \nimpact on ground or surface water \nquality. \n \nFloodplains and alluvium \nThe effects of climate change on the alluvial environment already impacts on engineering geological practice. \nAlluvial soils and flood plains are subject to more routine flooding. Additionally, increased seasonality of \ngroundwater levels is likely. This could result in increased rates of weathering due to physical erosion during \nflooding and the potential for desiccation and increased wind erosion. Increased river discharge offers the \npotential for undercutting and associated slope instability. \n \nWhere foundations have been constructed through organic soils, typically in the estuarine environment, \nconsideration may need to be given to the potential mobilisation of ground gases as a consequence of changes in \ngroundwater levels. Specific types of structure are more likely to be sensitive to these impacts, for example, \nwarehouses and industrial buildings are common to the estuarine environment and many in the United Kingdom \npre-date requirements for the incorporation of gas remedial measures. \n \nKim & Yang (2009) described how fluvial wetlands can provide valuable information with respect to changes in \nbase levels during the Holocene. In the UK many wetlands are considered to form an invaluable habitat. As \nclimate change is likely to be associated with rising sea-levels and more extreme climatic conditions, lowland \nwetlands may become increasingly vulnerable to marine or estuarine inundation. At the same time, upland \nwetlands could be subject to wasting as a consequence of drying during the hotter summers and erosion during \nmore extreme rainfall (and possibly also aeolian events). The advice of the engineering geologist working in \nconjunction with environmental scientists could be invaluable in designing novel mitigation measures to protect \nthese habitats.  \nCoastal processes \nForecasts for sea-level rise indicate a need to address: \n\uf0b7 inundation of populated areas \n\uf0b7 coastal instability \n\uf0b7 saline intrusion \nRises in sea level will result in increased pore water pressure in the coastal environment, with a potential danger \nto cliff stability. Coastal erosion as a consequence of isostatic readjustment along the east coast of Britain \nexemplifies the processes that influence cliff retreat. Associated with the coastal erosion many areas will be \nsubject to beach erosion, thereby increasing the potential for further wave erosion. Lowland areas will be at risk \nof inundation with a potential for significant economic cost, for example Zhang et al. (2004) have identified that \nat least 100 million people live within one metre of mean sea level. Global modelling of the type reported by \nNicholls et al. (1999) indicates that the populated areas most vulnerable to flooding are in the southern \nMediterranean, Africa and South and Southeast Asia, where there are significant concentrations of people in \ndelta settings. The greatest increase in flood risk is likely to occur in the Caribbean, the Indian Ocean islands and \nsmall islands in the Pacific Ocean (Nicholls et al. 1999). The effect of the relative rise in sea-level along the \ncoast of northern Brazil has led to the changes in planning regulations described by Szlafstein, (2009). Clearly, \nthere is a need for the engineering geologist to be included in the forecasting and mitigation strategy planning \nassociated with rising sea levels. \n \nInland flooding \nAs a consequence of the predicted increase in the intensity of rainfall, inland flooding is likely to impact on: \n\uf0b7 drainage basin landscapes; \n\uf0b7 contaminant mobilisation; (below)  \n\uf0b7 smear zone of contamination; (below) \n\uf0b7 geochemical conditions, for example repeated flooding encourages reducing conditions. \n \nOne of the roles of the engineering geologist is to understand the significance of the geology on river systems. \nThis can be important in terms of understanding the groundwater contribution to flooding \n(www.bgs.ac.uk\/programmes\/inposerv\/ip\/groundwaterflooding.html) and in terms of sediment stability. The \nwork reported by Falkowski (2009), which describes how sub-alluvial basement highs in the middle stretches of \nthe River Vistula, Poland have been identified as bedrock highs, demonstrates how the understanding of river \nbed form can contribute to the understanding of the hydrology of a river This is essential to the engineering of \neffective flood defences. The need to understand the consequences of increased bank storage and consequential \nrises in pore-pressures, with the potential risk to the stability of existing river defences and foundations along \nestuaries and river inlets, will be one of the future demands on engineering geologists. \n \nDrainage basin landscapes are susceptible to climate change. Arnell & Reynard (1996) presented the results from \nan investigation of potential changes in river flow in twenty one catchments in Great Britain. Annual run-off was \nsimulated to increase by more than 20%, by 2050, in the wetter catchments and to decline by a similar \npercentage in the drier catchments. Changes in monthly flows will be greater than those in the annual flows This \nhas implications for development within the flood plain and for catchment development. Tucker & Slingerland \n(1997) used computer modelling (GOLEM) to simulate basin evolution under the action of weathering \nprocesses, hillslope transport, fluvial bedrock erosion and sediment transport. They confirmed that, aside from \npotential impacts on landsliding and seepage erosion, increased intensity of rainfall, especially in conjunction \nwith a reduction in plant cover, can result in the expansion of the channel network and consequential \ndownstream aggradation of sediment. With time, the basinal processes will equilibrate with a change in the \nhydrological regime. However, in the short term, there is an increased potential for inland flooding associated \nwith the mobilisation of sediment. Although current planning requirements in the UK (Planning Policy Guidance \nNote 25, ODPM 2001) call for flood risk assessment to incorporate a factor of safety for climate change and \npotentially greater storm events, the potential for sediment mobilisation indicates that flood risk modelling in the \ncontext of climate change is actually more complex. Reference to the complexity associated with modelling has \nbeen examined by Prudhomme et al. (2003), in particular with reference to general circulation model (GCM) \nselection and its impact on the magnitude and frequency of return of a given frequency event.  \nLandslides \nSignificant rainfall events commonly trigger landslides, due to increasing pore pressures as described by Forster \net al. (2009), Cruden & Martin (2009) and Thomas et al. (2009). Forster et al. (2009) noted that there are several \nreasons climate change can be expected to promote landsliding: \n\uf0b7 increase in annual rainfall; notably several years of above average rainfall. \n\uf0b7 rainfall intensity. \n\uf0b7 increased coastal landsliding as a consequence of increased storm activity. \n\uf0b7 drier summers may facilitate tension gap development in crest\/ cliff top settings. \n \nAs groundwater is the most important single factor in triggering landslide events (Waltham 2002), landslides are \nparticularly vulnerable to changes in climatic conditions. More specifically, increased rainfall intensity facilitates \nincreases in porewater pressure, material softening, tension-gap loading and toe erosion (locally exacerbated by \nincreased stream erosion). Potential new mechanisms and processes of slope failure in response to changing \nclimatic conditions may be identifiable from the literature. For example, work carried out by Cammeraat et al. \n(2005) examined the influence of vegetation succession in mitigating landslide activity in the Alcoy Basin, \nSoutheast Spain. This research identified that increased vegetation cover progressively limits surface processes \n(sheet wash and concentrated overland flow) but most failures occurred below the depth of rooting and the \nsignificant factor was the rate of transfer to the potential slip plane via macro-pores. In the context of changing \nclimate and potential changes in vegetation this type of research is likely to become increasingly important and is \nexemplified by the BIONICS project (Glendinning et al. 2009). In another example of slope failure Loope et al. \n(1999) showed that in an Upper Cretaceous aeolian sand dune deposit in southern Mongolia, evapotranspiration \nduring the Cretaceous climatic conditions led to calcite accumulation in a thin layer in the order of 0.5 m below \nthe surface. The calcite deposit perched subsequent rainfall events and the consequential increase in pore \npressure was identified as the cause of translational slides and gravity flows. This example demonstrates the \nbenefit of revisiting the geological record to identify potential failure processes for the future and suggests the \nneed for a data-base linking sliding processes in the geological past with palaeoclimatic conditions. \nCLIMATIC VARIANTS \nWaltham (2002) included semi-arid and periglacial environments under this heading. Key engineering geological \nconsiderations in arid and semi-arid environments include: drainage (gorges, wadis and lakes), erosion \n(including aeolian erosion), sedimentation (alluvial fans and blown sand including dunes and loess) and sabkha-\ntype evaporites and duricrusts. In periglacial conditions they include: permafrost and solifluction with the \nassociated problems such as subsidence, landslides, heave, scree deposits and frost shattering. Climate change is \nlikely to extend the area of influence of these climates. \nGROUND INVESTIGATION  \nGround investigation techniques per se may not change greatly as a result of climate change but the focus of \nground investigations may be affected. To address this, it will be necessary for desk studies to assess the \npotential impacts of climate change, including both regional climate change and potential ground responses. \nSpecific areas can be identified, for example the depth to groundwater commonly will be impacted by climate \nchange; there is a possibility that for some sites, groundwater levels will be different to those anticipated, for \nexample, due to very dry or wet periods, which will affect the appropriate response zones for monitoring wells. \nMonitoring over longer time periods increasingly will be recommended to assess more fully the potential impact \nof climate change, which will demand increasingly rigorous methods for data storage and processing. \n \nThere is scope for more refined ground investigation associated with the areas discussed within this paper. For \nexample, the assessment of seasonality, which demands longer term monitoring, may drive demand for improved \ntechnology. Similarly, investigation of the unsaturated zone has increased interest in the use of tension \ninfiltrometers and the development of laboratory procedures to determine soil suction. Optical examination of \nlarge thin section samples prepared from kubiena soil samples has proved particularly successful in the \nunderstanding of glacial tills (Hart & Rose 2001, Phillips 2006) and could also prove to be a useful technique in \ncontributing to the understanding of material properties in the unsaturated zone. The use of radar interferometry \n(Culshaw et al. 2009) monitoring may be useful in studying changes in ground elevation in response to changes \nin groundwater levels in the estuarine environment where a significant proportion of near-surface soils are \nsusceptible to changes in volume in response to changes in moisture content. Specialist research areas encourage \nthe development of specialist investigatory techniques, for instance, in the assessment of the economies of \nground source heat pump installation. Sanner et al. (2000a) described the development of a thermal response test \ndeveloped to assess in-situ determination of thermal properties for ground heat pump design (described below). \nThis test, which has been designed for the assessment for larger plant, is carried out on a borehole heat \nexchanger in a pilot borehole. A heat load is applied to the borehole and the resulting temperature changes of the \ncirculating fluid measured. Similarly research of gas-hydrates has driven development of specialist high-pressure \nsampling techniques, as described at the Inmartech conference in The Netherlands (Rack et al. 2000). In the \ncontext of the Ocean Drilling Project, there has been considerable development of specialist site investigation \nequipment. Research and development continues for example, in the direction of the deep biosphere, \ndevelopment of a methane tool and pressure core sampling equipment, has enabled the development of new \nlaboratory methods for testing methane hydrates (Gunn et al. 2002). \nDIFFICULT GROUND CONDITIONS \nDifficult ground conditions identified by Waltham (2002) include: subsidence, soft ground, cavities, rockhead \nrelief, sinkholes, slope failure and mined ground. The following are considered particularly prone to the impacts \nof climate change, as described below: \n\uf0b7 collapsible soils;shrinkable clays;soluble rocks; \n\uf0b7 abandoned mines. \nCollapsible soils \nLoess, a widespread, uniformly graded (silt) aeolian deposit, laid down during cold periods associated with \nglaciations, is characteristic of materials referred to as collapsible soils. These are soils that are susceptible to \ncollapse upon wetting. Recent research (Zourmpakis et al. 2006) has demonstrated poor representation of \nlaboratory scale testing (oedometer tests) in the assessment of their field behaviour, which is better represented \nby combinations of geophysical and geotechnical monitoring techniques. Similar collapsible behaviour has been \nidentified in the Thanet Beds of southeast England and other uniformly graded soils. Where strength loss occurs \nin response to wetted front penetration, this may be attributable to one or more of a number of processes, such as \nbreaking of weak bonds, physical disturbance and displacement of bridging particles (also suspected in some \nloess deposits), or disruption of precipitates (crusts resulting from geochemical processes). The impact of \nincreased rainfall intensity is not necessarily translated into rapid wetted front penetration, as the soil response to \nrainfall intensity varies considerably between soil types. However, increased intensity has the potential both to \nmove surface material and compact the surface, thereby making it more prone to surface run-off (Statham 1977). \nSub-surface processes form a significant focus for research of the vadose zone, for instance, studies of macro-\npores and of wetting front instability resulting from air entrapment (Glass et al. 1989). \nShrinkable clays. \nClays are susceptible to changes in volume in response to changes in moisture content. Reflecting their \nmineralogy, some clays are more susceptible to volume change than others. A consequence of climate change is \nlikely to be seasonal reduction in soil moisture content due to lower summer rainfall and higher temperatures. \nThis is likely to lead to an increase in the number of cases of building damage that can be attributed to \nsubsidence resulting from clay shrinkage (Doornkamp 1993). In the urban environment there is increased local \nauthority interest in the impact of paving on tree root development. Generally, tree roots grow in the direction of \nleast resistance and best access to water, air and nutrients. In areas covered by paving, low moisture contents \nmay encourage roots to extend farther to find water, which can result in physical damage to buildings or \nfoundations either by clay shrinkage or by physical damage by roots. Research by Roberts et al. (1980) \nsuggested that there are limiting moisture contents, below which stromatal closure occurs. This is an area that \ncalls for further research, for example, some consideration has been given to the management of trees in the \nurban environment (BRE 2004). \nAbandoned mines \nExperience would suggest that some of the engineering problems associated with the legacy of the past that were \noutlined to this session could become increasingly significant in the context of global warming. Amongst these is \nthe potential for increased frequency of mine related, or shaft collapse (Heitfeld et al. 2009).  \nSoluble rocks. \nHazards associated with soluble rocks, such as limestone and gypsum, are well documented (Brooks et al. \n[2009], Cooper & Waltham 1999). Dissolution rates could be affected by climate change both in terms of \nchanging (generally increasing) temperatures and changes in the hydrological regime. Increased carbon dioxide \nconcentrations will alter pH conditions. Of particular interest may be the dissolution and precipitation of calcium \ncarbonate and calcium sulphate (gypsum). Aside from the potential physical changes resulting from such \nreactions, associated pH changes affect aggressiveness to construction materials such as concrete and steel. \nSimilarly, localised ponding could encourage the development of reducing conditions. Another example is the \npotential for increased dissolution of gypsum due to the greater intensity in rainfall (and also as a consequence of \ndrainage problems in urban environments), resulting in dissolution in areas that had previously been dry (Forster \n& Culshaw 2004). \nCONTAMINANT TRANSPORT PROCESSES \nIn contrast with drier areas (without extreme rainfall events), where less contaminant migration might be \nanticipated, in areas where there is more water (whether in total or at intervals as a result of extreme events) \nconsideration should be given to contaminant mobilisation and spreading, which could occur in response to a \nnumber of mechanisms: \n\uf0b7 increased flooding and, therefore, surface flow; \n\uf0b7 increased sub-surface flow; \n\uf0b7 increased transport of contaminants from vadose to saturated zone; \n\uf0b7 increased migration within the saturated zone. \n \nThe \u201csmear zone\u201d is the area around the water table over which contamination from the light non-aqueous phase \nliquid (LNAPL) contamination can migrate as a result of fluctuations in the level of the water table. \nContamination is present as immiscible product or as residual saturation within the capillary zone (Consultants in \nEnvironmental Sciences Ltd 2000). The extent of the smear zone is a function of the range of variation of the \nwater table. In areas, where climate change is likely to result in drier summers and wetter winters, the extent of \nthe smear zone is expected to increase. \nTHE ROLE OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY IN CLIMATE \nCHANGE MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION \nIn conjunction with developing understanding of the impacts of climate change on engineering geology, as a \ncommunity, engineering geologists have a responsibility to investigate how engineering geology can contribute \nto the mitigation of, and adaption to, climate change. Some possibilities are listed in Table 6 and expanded \nbelow. \nTable 6. Possible areas where engineering geologists can contribute to climate change mitigation. \nArea of contribution Issues addressed \nGround source heat pumps Non-fossil fuel energy \nCarbon sequestration Prevention of carbon entering atmosphere \nReduce Reuse Recycle Including:, use of waste products for building and \naggregates which result in a reduction in the use of \nresources (and hence energy) \n \nMitigation \nPolicy  \nSustainable Urban Drainage Systems Water resources \nWater Supply Water resources\nAdaptation \nPolicy  \n \nGROUND SOURCE HEAT PUMPS \nGround source heat pump (GSHP) systems utilise the sub-surface as a heat reservoir to supply energy without \nusing fossil fuels. A ground heat pump is a closed-loop compression-type refrigeration system comprising a \ncooling heat exchanger (evaporator), placed beneath the ground surface, linked to a heating radiator \n(compressor) placed where the generated heat is extracted from the ground. The heat exchanger is designed as \neither a vertical loop (borehole heat exchanger), or a horizontal loop. Alternatively, an open loop system fed by \ngroundwater from a well can be used. Whilst these systems are relatively common in America and in Europe, \ncurrently they are not widely known in the United Kingdom (Gale 2005); accordingly one of the roles of the \nengineering geologist is in knowledge transfer. There have been recent technological developments of the \nsystems that are available, including the design of thermally-enhanced grouting materials, to minimise heat loss \nto vertical loop systems installed in boreholes (Sanner, et al., 2000b). The initial installation costs are relatively \nhigh. However, they have relatively low running costs. A detailed understanding of the ground conditions is \nnecessary to provide advice on the viability of installation. The British Geological Survey offers web-based \nreporting products, to provide geological information and physical and thermal data. Neither the geology nor the \nengineering geology (except perhaps some types of unstable ground) preclude the use of GSHP. However, \nground conditions affect the: \n\uf0b7 heating and\/or cooling potential of the ground; \n\uf0b7 installation of the system (and therefore costs) for example, drilling or trenching methods.  \nSome of the ways ground conditions influence GSHP, largely based on Gale (2005), are tabulated below. \n  \nTable 7.

The \nterm may be used to include natural carbon sinks, such as forests and oceans, but in the context of engineering \ngeology is used to describe the capture and long-term storage of carbon dioxide before it is emitted into the \natmosphere. In the short term, carbon sequestration is being developed to separate CO2 from other power station \nemissions followed by the pumping of CO2 underground. In the longer term, this could be extended to capture \nCO2 from high carbon producing industries such as cement, ammonia and iron manufacture (IPCC 2007a). \nCurrently, carbon dioxide sequestration forms a significant focus for engineering geological research. Essential \nin the assessment of site suitability for carbon dioxide storage is an understanding of the physical properties of \ncarbon dioxide. Of particular note is the increase in carbon dioxide density in a depth range in the order of 500 to \n1000 m, depending on the geothermal conditions. Suitable geological conditions comprise: areas of sufficient \ncapacity (a function of porosity and thickness) and injectivity (permeability); presence of an extensive low \npermeability layer above the formation to prevent leakage (for example, shale, salt, anhydrite beds and a stable \ngeological environment (IPCC 2005). Holloway (2005) suggested that the main concepts for underground \nstorage sites for carbon dioxide fall into four main categories: natural and man-made caverns, unused porous and \npermeable reservoir rocks, depleted oil and gas fields and coal beds. The British Geological Survey has been \ninvolved in underground sequestration of carbon dioxide (Holloway 2005), focused on the Sleipner West gas \nfield, a sandstone reservoir, in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea, where in the order of one million ton of \ncarbon dioxide per year are being stored underground (Holloway 2005). In some settings there is a risk that sub-\nsurface storage of CO2 could result in fault reactivation, hence, measurement of in situ stresses and evaluation of \nfault stability are required (Streit & Hillis 2004). \n \nHolloway (2005) suggested that for this technology to spread to industrial plant and make a global impact on \nglobal carbon dioxide emissions there are a number of major issues that need to be addressed including: methods \nof capture, demonstration of safety and security and public acceptability. There are a number of other research \ndirections associated with carbon storage and capture, including: promoting the understanding of the physical \nproperties and underground migration of carbon dioxide, assessments of host rock\/ carbon dioxide interactions, \nparticularly in the context of carbonate stability, developing techniques for assessing and modelling site \nsuitability and monitoring carbon dioxide injection and monitoring. In the context of new sites, aspects such as in \nsitu stress conditions, geothermal gradients, receiving strata permeability and the identification of traps and \nassessments of seismic stability will require investigation, suggesting the potential for the development of new \nsite investigation and monitoring techniques. \nREDUCE, REUSE, RECYCLE \nAs in many fields, engineering geologists can look to contribute to sustainability by investigating (Table 8): \n\uf0b7 reducing inputs of materials; \n\uf0b7 reusing materials; \n\uf0b7 recycling. \n \nTable 8. Engineering geology and reduce, reuse,  recycle. \nAction Technique \nReduce Reducing use of concrete (a contributor of CO2) by better design or development of alternative \nmaterials, for example reuse of concrete aggregates in foundations ZICER Building, University \nof East Anglia, (BRE 2003) \nReuse Design to maximise reuse of materials on or close to site, e.g. balancing cut and fill operations for \ntransport (which has long been routine)  \nReuse, recycle Development of techniques to maximise materials reuse from deconstruction \nReduce, reuse Remediation selection to take account of likely reuse of generated materials, for example, soil \nwashing produces materials of various grades; some can be reused anywhere on site; some can be \nreused in less sensitive locations \nReuse, recycle Increased use of various waste products with a view to reuse as aggregate for selected purposes, \nefor example, colliery spoil, pulversised fuel ash, incinerator ash, slate and china-clay wastes \nRecycle Evaluating tyres (and other waste products) in respect of contamination potential so that they may \nbe confidently used (or rejected) as building materials \nReduce Better data analysis will increase the efficiency of site investigation, for example, geologist on \nsite; use of GIS, modelling tools. Benefits include: reduction in amount of site investigation, less \nconservative design for buildings and reduction in area requiring geotechnical or contamination \nremediation \nReduce Use of risk assessment to reduce size of areas requiring remediation. \n \nSUSTAINABLE URBAN DRAINAGE SYSTEMS (SUDS) \nOne impact of climate change is that many areas, particularly in the urban environment, will suffer from an \nincreased number of high intensity rainfall events which increase the risk of flooding. A method of mitigating \nagainst flooding is the use of Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDs), designed to return surface water to \nthe natural drainage system close to the source and reduce, or prevent, large volumes of water being released into \nthe artificial drainage system. SUDs also incorporate measures to remove pollutants. Design in accordance with \nSUDs (Woods Ballard et al. 2007) may be specified by building control to increase surface water storage in \nzones of potential groundwater flooding (ODPM, 2001), or simply for sustainable use of surface water in an area \nof newer building development and new road construction. In the context of flood-plain storage, SUDs ensure \nthe retention of surface water during periods of flooding, followed by later release, thereby reducing flood plain \nsurface water damage associated with a given flood event.  \n \nIn areas where drier periods are anticipated, SUDs are designed to increase water recharge in the wetter parts of \nthe year thereby contributing to the underground water resource. SUDs options include (Wilson et al. 2004; \nWoods Ballard et al., 2007): \n\uf0b7 Measures to reduce surface water volume, e.g. rainwater harvesting, green roofs \n\uf0b7 Measures to encourage infiltration into the ground, e.g. infiltration trenches; filter strips and swales \n\uf0b7 Provision for temporary water storage, e.g. basins and ponds \n\uf0b7 Flood impact management, e.g. sacrificial areas for flooding \nTable 9 details some of the ways ground conditions influence SUDs and hence ways in which engineering \ngeologists may become involved. \nTable 9. Influence of ground conditions on SUDs \nGround \ncharacteristic \nSignificance \nPermeability Drainage via features such as filter strips and swales requires sufficient ground \npermeability to allow infiltration of the expected run-off. In lower permeability \nmaterials a different approach e.g. constructed higher permeability materials is \nrequired.  \nHydrogeology Affects the amount of water that can be released into the ground without adverse \nimpact. For example, depth to groundwater, existing flow regime; existing water \nquality; presence of rising groundwater; groundwater abstractions \nGroundwater \nvulnerability \nImpact of potential pollutants \nGround stability Ponds, basins and swales may be vulnerable to slope instability in certain materials;  \nRelease of water into the ground via infiltration measures could also cause ground \ninstability \nSilty materials may be vulnerable to piping \nFoundations Potential adverse impact on foundations if infiltration measures are located close to \nstructures \nPollution On brownfield sites, prevention of infiltration may be important to prevent mobilisation \nof contamination \nLeakage from swales may concentrate diffuse contaminants, such as phosphates and \npesticides \n \nWATER SUPPLY \n \n.Climate change is likely to lead to a reduction in groundwater resources, for reasons such as: \n\uf0b7 Increased drought. \n\uf0b7 Decreased snow melt. \n\uf0b7 Salinisation due to rising aquifers. \n\uf0b7 Potential for increased contamination of supplies due to intense rainfall events. \n \nIn locations that experience seasonal shifts groundwater resources may be reduced if the highest rates of \nprecipitation occur during periods of higher temperatures and hence increased evapo-transpiration. Groundwater \nresources are increasingly vulnerable to contamination both as a consequence of increasing global \nindustrialisation and as a consequence of climate change. For example, rising sea levels, in conjunction with \nfalling inland groundwater levels could potentially result in increased saline intrusion in coastal areas.  This has \nbeen recognised in the identification of the River Arun in West Sussex, England  as a susceptible location  to the \nimpacts of climate change in South East England (Wade et al. 1999).  \n \nPOLICY \nIn developing methodologies for mitigating the impacts of climate change the engineering geologist should have \nan influence on policy development. UNEP (2007) acknowledges the importance of effective policy responses to \nclimate change and other environmental problems. \"The only way to address these harder problems requires \nmoving the environment from the periphery to the core of decision-making: environment for development, not \ndevelopment to the detriment of environment.\" Szlafsztein (2009) has shown how planning regulation has been \nin northern Brazil in response to rising sea-levels. Similarly, UK planning guidance requires consideration of \nclimate change, for example, in the context of Planning Policy Guidance 25 (ODPM 2001) and its replacement \nPlanning Policy Statement 25 (Communities and Local Government 2006a). More broadly, the consultation \ndocument Planning policy statement: Planning and Climate Change Supplement to Planning Policy Statement 1 \n(Communities and Local Government 2006b) embraces the need to consider climate change in the context of \nreducing emissions and the need to adapt to unavoidable consequences of climate change. There is a potential for \nthe use of maps of engineering geology to underpin planning decisions that are potentially influenced by climate \nchange. \n \nIssues raised in this paper suggest a need to further consider climate change in the context of UK engineering \nguidance on: \n\uf0b7 slope stability;extension of existing restrictions on floodplain development;re-assessment of \nfoundations in shrinkable soils; \n\uf0b7 groundwater protection; \n\uf0b7 Eurocode 7. \n \nCONCLUSIONS \nThe few papers that dealt with climate change in the Legacy of the past and future climate change Session of the \n10th IAEG Congress highlighted a range of issues that engineering geologists will have to address in order to \nadapt to climate change. This paper has raised further issues, in the context of changes in stress conditions and \nweathering processes. As with other areas of science, managing climate change requires increased collaboration, \nboth in terms of understanding processes and engineering procedures for mitigation. The relative absence of \ninformation available to the engineering geological community suggests that there is a need for knowledge \ntransfer and it is hoped that this paper has gone some way to raise the issues and provide routes to accessible \ninformation. In particular, consideration has been given to the modelling of climate change,, including GCM and \nmethods of down-scaling, which are important in understanding the likely change scenarios for individual \ncountries or regions and are required to relate the likely engineering geological impacts of climate change. \nCurrent research is largely focused on mitigation and adaption measures, such as carbon sequestration, methane \nhydrates and sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS). The systematic approach to assessing some of the \nlikely impacts of climate change on existing practice has highlighted the potential for research in areas that are \ncurrently largely addressed through empirical design. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis contribution has benefited from constructive comments made by Geoffrey Jago (East Midlands Regional \nGroup of the Geological Society) and Paul Nathanail (Land Quality Management).
