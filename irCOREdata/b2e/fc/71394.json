The legislation caused great controversy and anger \nin some quarters, especially in Tatarstan, the Russian republic whose attempt to Romanise the script \nfor the Tatar language  provoked the new law. This paper examines the background to these recent \nevents in the former Soviet Union, showing how they provide a contemporary illustration of the \nways that linguistic (specifically: orthographic) issues can interact with ideologies and discourses at \nthe political and social levels.  \n \nThe paper takes a approach which treats orthography (and script selection) as social practices which \nare amenable to sociolinguistic analysis, even though they may be modelled as autonomous systems \n(or \u201eneutral technologies\u201f) which can be detached from their social context (cf. Street\u201fs \u201eideological\u201f \nand \u201eautonomous\u201f models of literacy (1984)).  \n \nI begin with a very brief overview of the early 20\nth\n Century changes of script from Arabic to Roman \nand then to Cyrillic, which affected most of the Turkic languages, including Tatar, and an account \nof the trend to return to the Roman alphabet in the immediate post-Soviet period. I go on to describe \nthe circumstances of the decision by Tatarstan to introduce the script change, and the resulting \nbacklash from the government of the Russian Federation, in the form of a new language law.  \n \nI then go on to analyse the discourses which underlie this story of rebellion and reaction. In \nparticular, the following discourses are identified and discussed: unity and membership (the \ndiscourse of belonging); technology and globalisation; cultural heritage (change and permanence); \nCyrillic as \u201edefective\u201f \/ Cyrillic as a conduit for Russian lexis; Romanisation as a threat to the \nintegrity of Russia and its language.  It is noted that many of the discourses present in the Tatarstan \ncase are also found in other debates over orthographies elsewhere. \n \n \n \nIdeology and Alphabets in the former USSR \n \n 1 \nIdeology and Alphabets in the former USSR \n \n \nRUSSIAN LANGUAGES MUST USE SAME SCRIPT \nThe Russian lower house of parliament, the Duma, has adopted a law \nrequiring all state languages in Russia to be based on the Cyrillic alphabet. \nRussian TV said deputies made the move because they believe that using the \nsame alphabet will unite the country. \nRegions still wanting their languages to use the Latin alphabet will need to \napply for a separate federal law. \nOne opponent of the change said that no Tsar, nor even Ivan the Terrible had \ntried to \u201eattack the people\u201fs writing\u201f (BBC Monitoring report, CEEFAX p. \n143 6\nth\n June 2002) \n \n \nIntroduction  \n \nIn November 2002 the Russian parliament passed a law requiring all official languages within the \nRussian Federation to use the Cyrillic alphabet. The legislation caused great controversy and anger \nin some quarters, especially in Tatarstan, the semi-autonomous republic within the Russian \nFederation whose switch from Cyrillic to Latin\n1\n script provoked the new law. Even the international \nmedia gave it some attention. This script change, and the events which followed, provide a \ncompelling contemporary illustration of the ways that linguistic (specifically: orthographic) issues \ncan interact with ideologies at the political and social levels.  \n \nThe problematisation of orthography is widely reported in contemporary languages, for example \nDutch (Geerts et al. 1977, Jacobs 1997) Portuguese (Garcez 1995), German (Johnson 2002, 2005) \nand  French (Catach 1991). Disputes erupt not just over script changes and root-and-branch spelling \nreforms, but even over apparently minor matters such as the spelling of loan words and the use of \ndiacritics. For much of the 20\nth\n century, linguists tended to see such disputes as battles between the \nenlightened (linguists) and the uninformed (the masses). Their attention was focussed solely on the \nIdeology and Alphabets in the former USSR \n \n 2 \nlinguistic efficiency of the proposals\n2\n. Since the 1970s, however, a number of scholars have chosen \nto study such controversies in terms of their discourse. For example, Rothstein (1977) examines the \ndebate over Polish orthographic reforms of the 1930s by looking at the rhetoric of contemporary \nnewspapers. Geerts et al. (1977) do likewise for the Dutch spelling controversies of the mid-20th \ncentury, while Garcez discusses the arguments which surrounded the 1990 \u201eorthographic accord\u201f \nbetween the Portuguese-speaking countries. Within this tradition, researchers have increasingly laid \nemphasis on the ideological nature of the issues (e.g. Garcez (1995), Jaffe (1996), Sebba (1998), \n(Johnson 2002, 2005). National and ethnic identities are frequently what are really at stake in these \ncontroversies. For example, Johnson (2000:120) notes that via a \u201ediscursive drift,\u201f what was \nostensibly a dispute about the orthography of German turned into a debate about Germany itself. \n\u201eWhat was clearly at stake [..] was the German language in all its force as a signifier of cultural and \nnational identity\u201f. In disputes over Haitian orthography (Schieffelin and Doucet 1994) choice of \northography is seen as reflecting an orientation to the Francophone world on the one hand, or to \nindependence and anti-colonialism on the other. Similarly, in Galicia, an autonomous region of \nSpain, according to Herrero Valeiro (1993), choice of orthographic conventions reflects alignment \nwith a discourse of \u201edifferentialism\u201f (\u201eGalician is a language independent of Portuguese\u201f), or of \n\u201ereintegrationism\u201f (\u201ethere is no linguistic basis for calling Galician an independent language from \nPortuguese\u201f) in various degrees.   \n \nLooking at the way that script and spelling issues are debated around the world, we find that \northographies readily take on symbolism which extends far beyond the mechanics of a writing \nsystem; debates on orthography become symbolic battles over aspects of national, regional or ethnic \nidentity. In the words of Schieffelin and Doucet (1994:176), \u201eorthographic debates are rich sites for \ninvestigating competing nationalist discourses.\u201f \n \nIdeology and Alphabets in the former USSR \n \n 3 \nEira (1998) takes the notion of \u201ecompeting discourses\u201f as fundamental to understanding choices and \ndisputes over orthography. \u201eDisagreement and imposed change can be explained in terms of conflict \nwithin or between discourses; choices which appear inexpedient according to the framework of one \ndiscourse become comprehensible from the perspective of the discourse that motivates them\u201f (1998: \n171). \n \nThe row over scripts for Tatarstan is, as such disputes go, one of the most highly politicised, and \nhence interesting to study from the point of view of conflicting discourses. This will be the \napproach taken in the analytical part of this paper. The paper is organised as follows. In the \nremainder of Section 1, I give first a brief historical overview and then a more detailed account of \nthe history of orthography in the relevant regions over the last century, up to the end of the Soviet \nperiod. In Section 2, I describe the moves among speakers of Turkic languages to return to the Latin \nalphabet in the immediate post-Soviet period. Section 3 deals with the decision by Tatarstan to \nintroduce the script change, and the resulting backlash from the government of the Russian \nFederation, in the form of a new language law. In Section 4, \u201eOrthography and discourse\u201f, I \nexamine the Tatarstan script dispute in terms of its discourse around certain recurrent themes. \nSection 5 is the conclusion. \n1.1 Historical overview \nImperial expansion during Tsarist times meant that the Russian Empire included a great many non-\nRussian peoples, some of whom had long traditions of literacy in their own languages, while others \nhad no written language of their own. In particular, along its southern flank, the Russian Empire \nincorporated a swathe of peoples, mainly Muslim and speakers of closely related Turkic language \nvarieties, living in what have today become independent countries (Azerbaijan,   \nKazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan), or autonomous parts of the Russian \nFederation (Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, Tuva) or parts of other states which made up the former \nIdeology and Alphabets in the former USSR \n \n 4 \nUSSR (the Crimean Tatars in what is now Ukraine, the Karakalpaks in an autonomous region of \nUzbekistan).  \n \nThe past century has been a period of  orthographic instability for these regions. During the Tsarist \nperiod, the Turkic languages mainly used the Arabic script. During the 1920s, there was an \nambitious programme of alphabetic reform which led to the introduction of Latin script for all of \nthem by 1930. Scarcely had this programme become effective, when the Latin script was replaced \nby Cyrillic in the late 1930s, a move which is inextricably linked to Stalin and his policies towards \nthe non-Russian population of the USSR. Thus the Latin script, in use for only about a decade, \nserved as transitional between the Arabic and the Cyrillic, and three scripts were in use in the space \nof a single generation.  \n \nWith the demise of the USSR, many of the newly-autonomous or sovereign states decided to return \nto the Latin script, though not always to the version in use in the 1930s. Within Russia itself, the \ndecision of the government of Tatarstan to do this provoked a backlash, leading to the law which in \neffect established Cyrillic as the \u201eofficial script\u201f for all official languages in the Russian Federation  \nin 2002.  \n \n1.2 The Tsarist period \nLanguage policy during the Tsarist period was not very coherent and was aimed at promoting \nRussian as the official language of the Empire (Alpatov 1997: 28). Where language planning and \ndevelopment took place for the non-Russian languages it was more likely to be an  initiative of the \northodox Church than the government and was in many cases \u201elinked to missionary activity and \nassimilating policies\u201f (Reznik 2001).  \n \nIdeology and Alphabets in the former USSR \n \n 5 \nDuring the 19\nth\n century some language development work on the Turkic languages was carried out \nby missionaries who were also linguistic scholars, for example N.I. Il\u201fminskii, an expert in Turkic \nlanguages and former linguistics professor, who believed that using local languages as tools of \ninstruction would facilitate Russification and Orthodox education (Reznik 2001). According to \nPaksoy (1989 Chapter 2 pp. 2- 3) Il'minskii attempted to separate Tatar and Kazakh dialects and \nestablish a Cyrillic alphabet for the latter. \u201eIl'minskii strove to emphasize tribe-specific and regional \nvocabulary, using Cyrillic characters to stress differentiation visually and codify variations in \npronunciation, however minor.\u201f  \n \nThus even before the advent of the Soviet Union, the Turkic languages were the subject of \northographic intervention from Russia. This was to intensify during the Soviet period. \n \n1.3 The early Soviet period \nFollowing the Bolshevik revolution a re-evaluation of scripts took place. According to Winner \n(1952: 134), the Arabic script is \u201echaracterised by a great variety of forms in which one and the \nsame sound can be represented according to its position in the word and by the absence of symbols \nfor vowels\u201f and so is \u201epoorly adapted to the Turkic languages, particularly to those which have \npreserved the principle of vowel harmony\u201f. Nonetheless, there were reasons for retaining the Arabic \nscript. Henze points out that the lack of vowel symbols meant that some dialect differences were \nobscured in the written language, giving it wider currency (1977:373).  Furthermore, the Arabic \nscript was of cultural importance: \u201eThe Arabic alphabet had both symbolic and practical \nsignificance for the maintenance of religious and cultural ties \u2013 potentially political ties as well \u2013 \nwith the countries of the Middle East and with other more advanced Moslem peoples in the Russian \nEmpire\u201f (Henze 1977:373).     \n \nIdeology and Alphabets in the former USSR \n \n 6 \nIn this period there was debate about whether to retain the Arabic script, with improvements, or to \nLatinise. Modified Arabic alphabets were introduced for some Turkic languages in the early 1920s.  \nMuslim clergy and some of the local intellectuals argued for retaining the Arabic script. The \nconnection between the Tsarist Russification programme, Christian proselytising and the Cyrillic \nscript meant that Cyrillic was ruled out as a possible script for the Turkic languages. \u201eIn the local \npress it was frequently pointed out that the Russian script was too reminiscent of the old \nRussification policy, but that, as one article put it, \u201cthe Latin script does not have any of this feeling \nattached to it\u201d\u201f (Winner 1952:137). \n \nIn the debates about scripts, linguistic arguments were important. It was pointed out that the Arabic \nscript was unsuited to the Turkic languages, in particular because of its lack of vowel symbols. \nHowever, not all the arguments were linguistic. Some reformers used an internationalist argument: \n\u201eThe Moslem world needs an international alphabet. the Latin alphabet is not only international... it \nis known also to those nations which, like the Russian, do not use it\u201f (quoted by Winner 1952:136). \nOthers favoured the Latin alphabet because it would make it easier for Russians and others to learn \nthe Turkic languages, thus improving understanding among individual nationalities of the USSR \n(Peskov, quoted in Azerbaijan International 2000).  \n \nThe movement towards Latinisation among the non-Russian peoples of the USSR needs to be seen \nin the context of wider positive attitudes towards the Latin alphabet. So strong was the association \nof the Latin script with modernisation and technological progress that during the 1920s and 1930s \nthere was a serious debate in Russia over whether the Latin alphabet could replace Cyrillic in the \nRussian language itself\n3\n. In 1929 a Commission was set up to promote the Latinisation of Russian, \nunder the chairmanship of the distinguished linguist Iakovlev. It included several other famous \nlinguists (Reznik 2001). According to Winner, \u201ethe project of Latinising the Russian language was \nIdeology and Alphabets in the former USSR \n \n 7 \nvigorously supported by a number of leading government officials, among them the first People\u201fs \nCommissar of Education, A. Lunacharsky\u201f (Winner 1952:137).  \n \nIn spite of all this, Russian did not Latinise, but the Turkic languages did. Both before and after the \nRevolution, Azerbaijan, the most westerly and most industrialised of the Muslim Turkic-speaking \nterritories, led the way in the movement towards Latinisation (Winner 1952:135). Alphabet reform \nhad already been a topic of discussion in Azerbaijan during the 19\nth\n century. The transition to Latin \nscript was recommended as early as 1922 by the Soviet government of Azerbaijan, sparking \ndiscussion in the other Turkic-speaking areas of the USSR (Winner 1952:135). The Latin alphabet \nwas introduced in Azerbaijan in 1924 and made compulsory for newspapers and official use in 1925, \nthough the Arabic script continued in concurrent use until 1929 (Henze 1977:376). \n \nIn 1926 the First Turcological Congress was held in Baku (Azerbaijan). During eight days of debate, \nthe merits of retaining the Arabic script were compared with the benefits and costs of converting to \nthe Latin alphabet. The Latinists won the day, and the Latinisation of all the Turkic languages of the \nU.S.S.R. was proclaimed official policy (Henze 1977:376).  \n1.4 The New Turkic Alphabet  \nOne outcome of the First Turcological Congress was a blueprint for a unified alphabet for all the \nTurkic languages. The New Turkic Alphabet (known as the Yanalif from the words for \u201enew\u201f and \n\u201ealphabet\u201f) was eventually agreed by the All-Union Central Committee on the New Turkic \nAlphabet which met in 1927 \u2013 28. It was basically the standard Latin alphabet with a few \nsupplementary letters and diacritics to meet the requirements of the Turkic language varieties. The \nUnified Turkic Latin Alphabet was adapted to all the Turkic languages of Soviet Central Asia \nbetween 1927 and 1930 - Kazakh, Uzbek, Turkmen, Karakalpak and Kirghiz (Henze 1977:377). By \n1929 use of the NTA effectively became compulsory and the import of typographical material in \nIdeology and Alphabets in the former USSR \n \n 8 \nArabic was forbidden (Winner 1952:143). The introduction of the New Turkic Alphabet was \neffectively completed by 1936. \n \nThe Azerbaijani reforms provided a model for Turkey's transformation from Arabic script to its \nown variant of the Latin alphabet in 1928, which formed a key part of Ataturk\u201fs modernisation \nprogramme. The alphabet used in Turkey was similar to the Yanalif, but not identical. According to \nHenze, (1977: 377) Romanisation in Turkey probably had the effect of speeding up the pace of \nromanisation in the USSR, as Turkic-speaking intellectuals in the USSR were very interested in \ndevelopments in Turkey.  \n \nThe development of the Yanalif was a step towards the creation of a unified Turkic language in \nCentral Asia, by minimising the differences between the written forms of local varieties. Henze \nwrites (1977:376): \u201eThe very concept of a unified Turkic alphabet meant that its proponents aimed \nat achieving the fullest possible degree of linguistic uniformity among speakers of Turkic languages \nin the U.S.S.R., with the intention of facilitating contact among them and creating a sense of unity \nand common purpose.\u201f4 During this period, such feelings of unity could still be expressed within the \nUSSR, though only \u201ein linguistic and cultural terms\u201f.  \n \nHowever, political changes were already in the wind. Trends towards closer relationships between \nthe various Turkic-speaking groups \u2013 and particularly, links between the Turkic-speaking peoples \nof the USSR and Turkey itself \u2013 attracted suspicion in Moscow. The cultural link created by the \nsimultaneous Latinisation of Turkey and the Central Asian communities of the USSR may have set \nalarm bells ringing in Moscow and turned the policy of the Communist Party in favour of \nCyrillicisation, which followed almost as soon as Latinisation was complete. \n1.5 The change to Cyrillic  \nIdeology and Alphabets in the former USSR \n \n 9 \nFrom 1937 onwards there began a rapid shift towards use of Cyrillic scripts for the Turkic \nlanguages. Henze\n5\n suggests that the decision to change the Turkic alphabets to Cyrillic may have \nbeen made in the early 1930s, following the success of the Latinisation programme in Turkey.  \n \nThe goals and the rhetoric of the Cyrillicisation programme were very different from those of  \nthe Latinisation of the previous decade. The keystone of Latinisation had been the New Turkic \nAlphabet, the Yanalif, with its potential for creating a unified written Turkic language. By contrast, \nCyrillicisation was about facilitating the Central Asian peoples\u201f learning of Russian and their \nassimilation to Russian culture. Khatskevich, secretary of the Soviet of Nationalities of the U.S.S.R., \nargued in 1937 that \u201ethe creation of new written languages should facilitate international \nunderstanding\u201f.  The drawback of the Latin script, he pointed out, was that it separated the smaller \nnationalities from the \u201ebasic\u201f nationalities of the USSR (Winner 1952: 145), i.e. Russia. Or, as \nPravda put it in 1939: \u201ethe transition to the Russian script will contribute to an even greater \nunification of the peoples of the USSR, to an even greater strengthening of the friendship of the \npeoples of the USSR\u201f (Winner 1952: 146). \n \nThere was also an argument based on the availability of education. Since most higher education was \navailable only in Russian, knowledge of Cyrillic would eliminate the need to learn two alphabets \nand make it easier for people from the minority nations to learn Russian (Winner 1952:146), \nsomething that the Russians viewed as wholly positive and necessary\n6\n. Reflecting on these \ndevelopments in 1952, the eminent Soviet Turcologist Baskakov wrote: \u201eThe adoption of the \nRussian script by most of the languages has not only contributed to their development, but has been \nof notable assistance to the various nationalities of the Soviet Union in their successful mastery of \nthe Russian language and in the assimilation of Russian culture\u201f (quoted by Henze 1977:381). \n \nIdeology and Alphabets in the former USSR \n \n 10 \nWhile the Latinisation programme had been able to draw on the unified Yanalif model for all \nlanguages, there was no unified Cyrillic Alphabet, so each language Cyrillicised separately. \nAccording to Henze (1977:382), the Communists were unwilling now to allow the Turkic peoples \neven \u201ethe semblance of alphabetic unity\u201f. Borovkov, a Soviet linguist writing in 1956, \u201egave a vivid \npicture of variations in the use of letters and application of spelling principles in the various Soviet \nTurkic languages. While in addition to the normal Cyrillic alphabet, the Kirghiz language employs \nthree supplemental letters, Uzbek uses four, Kazakh nine, and Uigur as written in Kazakhstan eight; \nthe revised Karakalpak alphabet required six additional letters\u201f (cited by Henze 1977:389).  \n \nBorovkov called attention to how these orthographic variations in effect produced different \nlanguages: \u201eThe phonetically extremely similar Karakalpak and Kazakh languages [\u2026] are \ncompletely different in writing: The alphabets in both languages are different; the orthographic \nsolution of identical features is accomplished in different ways\u201f (cited by Henze 1977:388-389). \n \nAccording to Paksoy (1989) this orthographic differentiation of similar language varieties had \nbegun in Tsarist times with the interventions of Il'minskii (see 1.1). \u201eDistorting the phonological \naspects of local usages constituted a step toward the later Soviet policy [\u2026] of recording such \ndifferences in subsets of Latin, then Cyrillic orthography, and dubbing each product a \u201cseparate \nlanguage.\u201d\u201f In the Soviet period, Paksoy writes, \n \na language policy was implemented in Central Asia which strove to establish the various \ndialects as separate languages. The current Uzbek, Kazakh, Kirghiz, Turkmen and other Central \nAsian \u201elanguages\u201f [\u2026] so rigidly favored by the Soviets were [\u2026] inspired by Il'minskii's work.  \n \nThe formulation of \u201enew\u201f alphabets (actually the addition of new symbols to the Latin, then the \nCyrillic alphabets) for each \u201elanguage\u201f is yet another aspect of this policy [\u2026] In essence, this \nIdeology and Alphabets in the former USSR \n \n 11 \npractice amounts to no more than changing the spelling rules and calling the final product a \n\u201elanguage.\u201f (Paksoy 1989 Chapter 2, p. 7, footnote omitted). \n \nThe principle of Turkic alphabetic unity having gone out the window, another principle was \nintroduced. Inevitably, the introduction of Cyrillic script would make it easier for the Turkic \nlanguages to assimilate Russian words. \u201eThe rule was soon established that all words taken from the \nRussian must be spelled exactly as in Russian\u201f even where some phonological adaptation would be \nexpected (Henze 1977:383). This paved the way for the mass importation of Russian vocabulary, \nunadapted, into the Turkic languages. Once again, this was seen as a positive achievement, attained \nby paying due attention to linguistic principles. Baskakov wrote (1952, quoted by Henze 1977:381): \n \nThe exceptional importance of the Russian alphabet calls for special care in its use. The task of \nthe simultaneous inculcation of literacy in both the native and Russian languages can only be \nsuccessfully performed by achieving the maximum equality in the value of the letters. In the \nalphabets based on Russian devised for each language, there should be as little conflict as \npossible between the value of those symbols and letters common to both the native language \nand the Russian, which are used only for the phonemes of the national language, and other \nsymbols and letters, also common to both, which are used only for loan words. \n \nLooking back more than half a century later, the Latinisation and Cyrillicisation programmes can be \nseen as two very different kinds of activity, with different goals, different levels of popular \nparticipation, and differently perceived by speakers of the languages involved. While Latinisation \nwas controversial and not without its problems, it was thoroughly debated and phased in with the \ninvolvement of local intellectuals and the public. Cyrillicisation is nowadays almost always \ndescribed as having been \u201eimposed\u201f (often \u201eimposed by Stalin\u201f)7.  \n \nIdeology and Alphabets in the former USSR \n \n 12 \nAlthough there were many problems associated with implementing the Cyrillic scripts in Soviet \nCentral Asia (see Henze for a discussion), and there were some reforms and discussions about \nreform from the 1950s onwards, the Cyrillic scripts endured until the end of the Soviet era. \nUnsurprisingly, however, the end of the Soviet Union brought about another re-evaluation of the \nCyrillic scripts and a fresh set of changes. \n \n2 The post-Soviet era: moves towards Latinisation in the Turkic-speaking \nstates \n \nAs the Soviet era drew to a close, the component parts of the USSR began to assert their \nindependence. As early as 1989, Moldova changed officially from Cyrillic to Latin script, making \nthe written Moldovan identical with written Romanian (see photograph). Even before this, moves \ntowards Latinisation had begun among the Turkic-speaking peoples of Central Asia. During the late \n1980s and early 1990s most of the Turkic-speaking republics formed alphabet commissions, which \nrecommended a return to the Latin script (Nissman and Hill 1997). New language laws were \npromulgated in most of the republics, redefining the relationships between the local languages and \nRussian, and setting timetables, in some cases, for the introduction of Latin script. According to \nSchlyter (2001, 3.5) \u201etransition periods of around 10 years\u201f were envisaged in most cases, but have \nsince come to be seen as unrealistic.  \n \n \n \n[photo here]  \nIdeology and Alphabets in the former USSR \n \n 13 \nAugust 1990: Moldova celebrates a national festival to mark the first  \nanniversary of its return to Latin script (Photo: the author) \n \nThe new drive to Latinise is taking place in a very different context from that of the 1920s. At that \ntime, most of the entities involved were constituent parts of the Soviet Union (Turkey being the \nmain exception). Now, there are a number of independent countries - Azerbaijan,   \nKazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan - each with their own linguistic problems, \nagendas, funding priorities and political systems. In addition, there are a number of more or less \nautonomous states or communities which form parts of other states: Tatarstan in the Russian \nFederation, the Crimean Tatars in what is now Ukraine, and the Karakalpaks in an autonomous \nregion of Uzbekistan. Each is moving towards alphabetic reform, if at all, at a different pace and \nwithin a different legislative framework. \n \nAs in the first Latinisation movement, Azerbaijan set the pace: its parliament voted to adopt the \nLatin script shortly after independence from the USSR in 1991. In 2001 a presidential decree was \npublished to make the change complete: \u201eFrom now on, no official or commercial document should \ncontain a single character in the Cyrillic alphabet\u201f (Peuch 2001). The change was not without \nproblems. Rather than comply with the decree, one newspaper started publishing in Russian rather \nthan Azerbaijani, while another simply continued to publish in Cyrillic. At the same time a \npresidential decree instructed the government to institute penalties for \u201ecovert and open propaganda \nagainst the state language and resistance to the use of the state language and Azerbaijani alphabet\u201f \n(RFE\/RL Newsline, 20 June 2001). \n \n The Russian media reported on 2\nnd\n August 2002, perhaps with a touch of schadenfreude\n8\n, that the \nchange to Latin in Azerbaijan \u201eafter initial successes, had encountered serious difficulties\u201f including \nIdeology and Alphabets in the former USSR \n \n 14 \nmuch-reduced print runs for periodicals, and that it had proved impossible to eliminate Cyrillic \nfrom television programming (Ogorodnikov 2002)\n9\n.)     \n \nElsewhere, according to Schlyter (2001), Kazakhstan and Kirghizistan have made no recent \nlegislation on alphabets, although \u201ethe change-over to Latin script is subject to commissioned \ndiscussions and work\u201f (Schlyter 2001:3.3). In 2001 Kazakhstan was reported to be looking \nseriously at a new proposal for a Latin-based alphabet (RFE\/RL Central Asia Report 27 July 2001). \n  \nIn Turkmenistan, \u201ea Turkmen Latin alphabet was adopted in 1993 which included some \ninconvenient special letters not found in any other Turkic Latin alphabet\u201f (Schlyter 2001:3.7). In \nUzbekistan, \u201etwo alphabets that have been so far proposed for Uzbek in 1993 and 1995 respectively, \nhave been heavily criticized even by the Uzbeks themselves, including Uzbek linguists\u201f (Schlyter \n2001: 2.2); while a similar modified Karakalpak Latin alphabet was introduced in 1995 (2001:2.1). \nThe Parliament of the Crimean Tatars of the Ukraine approved a Latin script in 1997 for gradual \nintroduction by 2002 (Republican Crimean Tatar library, \nhttp:\/\/www.geocities.com\/ai320\/q_education.htm). \n \nClearly, there is not even a \u201esemblance of unity\u201f in the move towards Latinisation this time round. \nThe existence of the New Turkic Alphabet in the 1920s and 1930s has enabled states to draw on a \ndiscourse of \u201ereturning\u201f to Latin script after decades of \u201eimposed\u201f Cyrillic, but in practice, there has \nnot been a return to the unified Yanalif, nor is there a new common standard. According to Schlyter \n(2001:4.1),  \n \nThe first in a series of alphabet conferences in Turkey was held in November 1991 at the \nMarmara University in Istanbul (Devlet 1992). The basic Turkic alphabet adopted there has \nappeared from time to time in publications where it is presented as the valid new Turkic \nIdeology and Alphabets in the former USSR \n \n 15 \nLatin alphabet. However, as things now stand, not only Uzbekistan, Karakalpakistan \nincluded, but also Turkmenistan and possibly also Kazakhstan have introduced alternative \nalphabets that are not just modifications of the basic Turkic alphabet but alphabets which \ndiffer on certain fundamental points from the Turkic one. \n \nShe adds that though Turkey has retained an interest in these matters, it \u201eseems to have become \nquite disenchanted by the recent developments\u201f (Schlyter 2001:4.2) .  \n \nAgainst this background of international moves towards Latinisation we turn now to look at \ndevelopments in Tatarstan. \n \n3 The Tatarstan script change and its consequences \n \n3.1 Tatarstan moves towards Latinisation \nTatarstan is one of the constituent republics of the Russian Federation. Only a minority of speakers \nof Tatar live there; more than 60 percent of ethnic Tatars live outside its boundaries. The Tatars are \nRussia's second largest ethnic group, after the Russians themselves (Khasanova 1997).  Within \nTatarstan, the Tatars constitute about half the population and Russians around 40% (see Lepr\u00eatre \n2002)\n 10\n. Tatars are also the second largest ethnic group (after Russians) in the neighbouring \nrepublic of Bashkortostan, ahead of the titular nationality, the Bashkirs. Tatars also live in other \ncountries which were part of the former USSR, and many emigrated at various stages in the last \ncentury and settled in other parts of the world. \n  \nAs mentioned in Section 1, the Tatar language was the subject of linguistic missionaries\u201f \ninterventions even during Tsarist times. During the Soviet era, Tatar followed the same path as the \nIdeology and Alphabets in the former USSR \n \n 16 \nother Turkic languages. From being written mainly in the Arabic script, it underwent a conversion \nfirst to the Latin alphabet in the 1920s\n11\n and then to Cyrillic about a decade later. While Tatars \nwithin the boundaries of the former USSR continued to use the Cyrillic alphabet up to the present, \nemigrant communities use the Yanalif Latin script.  \n \nIn the late 1990s, the Tatarstan government took steps to restore the Latin alphabet to the Tatar \nlanguage. Given that a minority of Tatars live within its jurisdiction, the government of Tatarstan \ncould not be expected to legislate on the Tatar language entirely on its own. The decision to change \nto Latin script for writing Tatar was made after the Second World Congress of Tatars in Kazan on \nAugust 26-30, 1997. In an appeal to Tatarstan's president Mintimer Shaimiev, Congress delegates \nsaid that: \u201eWe, the participants of the Second World Congress of Tatars, believe that the transition \nto the Latin alphabet for the Tatar language is a measure whose time has come.... This would permit \nall Tatars to have one written language, which is of primary importance in uniting the people.\u201f \n(Khasanova 1997).  \n \n3.2 Implementation of the changes \nAccording to Khasanova (1997), this resolution by the Second World Congress of Tatars, whose \ndelegates \u201ewere elected by Tatar communities in twenty countries and sixty Russian regions\u201f \nconferred legitimacy on the action of the Tatarstan government in initiating the conversion of Tatar \nto the Latin alphabet.  The State Council of Tatarstan adopted an alphabet for the Tatar language \nbased on Latin script in 1999. The law went into effect in September 2001, with the new \northography being introduced gradually. Both the Latin and Cyrillic alphabets were to be in use \nuntil 1 September 2011 (RFE\/RL Russian Political Weekly, 20 November 2002). An amount of \nUS$700,000 was made available to cover the costs of the project's initial stages (Crescent \nInternational June 1-15, 2001).  \nIdeology and Alphabets in the former USSR \n \n 17 \n \nA commission was set up to oversee the process and transliteration and spelling rules were \napproved in July 2000, enabling schools in Tatarstan to introduce the Latin script for written work \nin the national language as early as September 2000 (Goble 2000). An Education Ministry \nspokeswoman was quoted as saying that \u201ethis return to the Latin script both permits a better \nrepresentation of the national language's sound patterns and will help Tatar students to learn English \nand other European languages\u201f (Goble 2000). Textbooks were rewritten for the experimental stage, \nwhich began in March 2001, and by the end of 2001 all first-graders in the republic's schools, \nwhether ethnic Tartars or Russians, would be required to learn Tatar in the new alphabet. The entire \nproject was expected to take 10 years to complete and to cost about $7 million. (Crescent \nInternational June 1-15, 2001). \n \n3.3 The backlash  \nThe move to Latin script soon provoked a response from the government of the Russian Federation.  \nDuring September 2001, as the Tatarstan laws came into effect, deputies in the Duma began putting \nforward amendments to the Federal language laws to outlaw the Tatarstan proposals. The \nUnity faction in the Duma proposed an amendment stating that \u201eRussia's state language and the \nstate languages of the republics use Cyrillic-based alphabets. Other alphabets may be introduced \nonly by federal law\u201f (Tatnews.ru, 18 September 2001, cited in the Jamestown Monitor 25th \nSeptember 2001). Unity called on Tatarstan's leaders to review the potential political fallout that \nwould allegedly result from their decision to switch to the Latin script. \n \nThe rhetoric of the debate made it clear that Tatarstan was being accused of nothing short of \ndisloyalty to the Russian Federation. The pro-Kremlin media called Tatarstan's proposed switch to \nthe Latin alphabet \u201ea threat to the integrity of Russia\u201f (Strana.ru, September 19). Even external \nIdeology and Alphabets in the former USSR \n \n 18 \nobservers could see it this way: a French expert on Russia, Ellen Carrer d\u201fAncos was reported in Le \nFigaro as saying: \u201eThe reform destroys one of the few factors of the Russian Federation\u201fs integrity, \nnamely, the same alphabet that makes it easy to use the Russian language. That causes concern all \nby itself and may set an example for other peoples of the Russian Federation\u201f (Quoted from Globus, \nBulletin of ITAR- TASS, No. 50, 1999, by Alapatov (2002:124)). \n \n The spectre of Turkish involvement was raised in various ways. The chairman of the subcommittee \nfor language policy, ethnic minorities and indigenous peoples, Kaadyr-ool Bicheldei, warned that \nTatarstan was showing a dangerous tendency toward rapprochement with Turkey (Jamestown \nMonitor 25\nth \nSeptember 2001). It could not, he said, be ruled out that other republics in the Russian \nFederation might follow suit. There had been earlier suggestions in the press that Zakiyev, the \ndirector of the Ibrahimov Institute of Linguistics, Literature and Arts in Tatarstan, had lobbied for \nthe script change with the aid of Turkish money (Panorama-Forum 2000, No. 23).  Bicheldei saw it \nas significant that Tatarstan did not plan to return to its old (1927) Latin alphabet but was preparing \nto introduce an alphabet based on the Turkish one. \u201eThis is a frightening tendency\u201f he told the \nmedia, \u201eas if the Republic is turning towards Turkey\u201f (Malyutina (2002a) = Gazeta.ru, 15 \nNovember 2002)\n12\n.  \n \nIn September 2001 a petition from residents of Kazan was presented to the Tatarstan parliament. \nThe petition \u201ewarned of the \u201ethreat to national security\u201f contained in Tatarstan's plans to revise its \nscript. It expressed \u201ealarm for the fate of our native Tatar language\u201f and concern that \u201etraditions will \nbe destroyed, new textbooks will have to be printed, new teaching methods developed, books \ntranslated, teachers retrained. Huge funds will have to be spent on all of this.... It will cause a split \nin our society. It will be difficult for people to learn how to read and write anew.... The link between \ngenerations will be broken\u201f\u201f (Jamestown Foundation Monitor 25 September 2001, citing Interfax \nand Polit.ru as sources).  However, \u201efewer than fifty people\u201f signed this appeal (ibid.) \nIdeology and Alphabets in the former USSR \n \n 19 \nSimultaneously, a petition signed by famous and high-ranking Tatars living in Russia outside \nTatarstan was published in a Russian newspaper, Rossiyskaya Gazeta. This petition cited \u201edeep \nalarm for the fate of the native Tatar language, ...the language that helps us maintain and strengthen \nthe spiritual link with our historical motherland, to feel ourselves an integral part of the great Tatar \npeople.\u201f The change to Latin script threatened \u201ethe literacy and education of our rising generation, \naccess to knowledge and literature, scientific investigation, ...in sum, the development of Tatar \nnational culture beyond the borders of the historical motherland\u201f (Jamestown Foundation Monitor \n25 September 2001, citing Vechernyaya Kazan and NNS.ru as sources).  \n \nThe Tatar media responded by casting some doubt on the genuineness of the petition. Newspapers \nreported that one alleged signatory denied signing it, while another was reported to have apologised \nto his friends, saying he was pressured to sign although he agreed with the switch to Latin. Another \nsignatory was reported to be mentally ill. The Tatarstan government claimed that the protests were \norchestrated by Moscow and that the petition had been organised \u201eby the staff of the Russian \nPresident\u201f   (RFL\/RE Weekly Review from Tatarstan 21 September 2001). \n \nIn March 2002 the State Duma Council voted to include in its legislative programme an amendment \nto the Russian language law, stating that: \u201eThe official language of the Russian Federation and \nofficial languages of the constituent republics thereof shall use alphabets based on the Cyrillic.\u201f The \namendment was initiated by the presidential administration as a response to Tatarstan's decision to \nrestore the Tatar Latin alphabet, according to its main proposer, Kaadyr-ool Bicheldei. He claimed \nthat all 29 of the members of the Russian Federation had discussed and accepted the draft, apart \nfrom Tatarstan. Among 10 deputies who proposed the draft in the Duma, there were three from \nTatarstan. One of these, Shashurin, was quoted as saying that the Tatar switch to Latin would \n\u201ethreaten Russia's national security and integrity via Turkish expansion\u201f. He called forth images of \nbackwardness and poverty, by saying: \u201eNow we switch the Tatar language to Latin and then we will \nIdeology and Alphabets in the former USSR \n \n 20 \nride donkeys like in Afghanistan\u201f. Fandas Safiullin, a deputy from Tatarstan, put down an \nalternative amendment, to allow nationalities to solve issues concerning their languages on their \nown; it was rejected. He told the assembly that the approved draft amendment \u201ehas nothing to do \nwith linguistic science, but is purely politically motivated.\u201f In Safiullin's words, the draft \u201eaccused \nthe entire Tatar nation [and] its intelligentsia by declaring them a collective Turkish spy\u201f (RFL\/RE \nDaily Review from Tatarstan 13 March). \n \nThe amendment received its first reading in June 2002 and was passed by 343 votes to 15. \nSupporting the bill, Andrei Loginov, governmental envoy to the Duma, said that the refusal of \nrepublics to use the Cyrillic script would damage Russia's integrity and could require \u201ethe difficult \npsychological adaptation of millions of people\u201f to get used to the new scripts. He said that writing \ncan be regulated by the law inasmuch as it is an element of a social contract and if everyone invents \nhis or her own writing, it would lead to chaos in the state. 13 (Prokhorov 2002 = Gazeta.ru, 6 June \n2002). Anatoli Nikitin of the nationalities committee said that the existing federal legislation left a \ngap where languages and their alphabets were concerned. The new bill filled in the blank spot. \nWriting unified throughout Russia will promote its cultural and educational unity, he pointed out in \na co-report on the issue (Pravda.ru, 5th June 2002, RFL\/RE Daily Review from Tatarstan, 6 June \n2002). \n \nThe bill had plenty of opponents. One deputy claimed that the amendment was aimed at fictitious \nthreats to national security from the Turkic nationalities, designed to distract attention from the real \nproblems like corruption. Others, including Presidential representative to the State Duma Aleksandr \nKotenkov said the adoption of the draft would result in the growth of nationalism in Russia. Andrei \nVulf of the Union of Rightist Forces said the proposed amendments would be harmful to the \ndevelopment of federalism in Russia and were a means of suppressing national languages and \nnational identities which would result only in bitterness toward Russians. (RFE\/RL Weekly Review \nIdeology and Alphabets in the former USSR \n \n 21 \nfrom Tatarstan 7 June 2002). Similar points were made by the Tatarstan government and its \nsupporters: Deputy Fandas Safiullin claimed that it would reduce the chances of former Soviet \nrepublics reuniting with Russia, since Russia \u201ewould force its subjects to use the Cyrillic script\u201f \n(RFE\/RL Daily Review from Tatarstan 7 June 2002). The Tatar political commentator and \ngovernment adviser Lev Ovrutskii went further. Writing in the weekly Moskovskii Komsomolets v \nTatarstane, he called the Duma's decision a means of  \u201edestroying the unity of multiethnic \nRussia...by calling the evil spirits of the [Russian] empire back from the past...and taking a truly \ntotalitarian approach\u201f (RFE\/RL Weekly Review from Tatarstan 14 June 2002). \n \nFor the Tatarstan government, the Tatarstan Deputy State Council Chairman Robert Minnullin \ncalled the bill \u201eone more slap in Tatarstan's face\u201f and a warning from Moscow. He expressed regret \nthat representatives of national minorities, not Russians, initiated this draft, among them Tatars, \nTuvins\n14\n, Bashkirs, and representatives of the Caucasian peoples. (RFE\/RL Daily Review from \nTatarstan 10 June 2002).  Fandas Safiullin claimed that the amendments \u201econtradict several \nprovisions of the Russian Constitution and discriminate against the Tatar language in comparison \nwith non-state languages in the country, since these would be allowed to continue using non-\nCyrillic scripts.\u201f He insisted that the draft legislation was \u201eso weak that it won't have any serious \nconsequences for Tatarstan.\u201f (RFE\/RL Daily Review from Tatarstan 7 June 2002).  \n \nThe bill had its final reading and was approved by both houses of parliament in November 2002. In \nthe Duma 336 deputies backed the document, while the liberal Union of Rightist Forces and the \nYabloko faction refused to take part in the voting altogether, claiming that the bill was aimed \nagainst the peoples of Russia. Its main proposer, Kaadyr-ool Bicheldei, professed himself satisfied: \n\u201eIt went fairly smoothly\u201f he told the media. \u201eWe have protected the rights of citizens to education \nand access to information\u201f ((Gazeta.ru, 15 November 2002). \n \nIdeology and Alphabets in the former USSR \n \n 22 \nSupporters of the change to Latin script pointed out various ways of circumventing the legislation. \nTatarstan could remove the official status of Tatar and introduce Latin script without infringing the \nlaw. Deputy Safiullin claimed the law would be ineffective anyway: how and who will be punished \nfor writing a holiday postcard in the Latin alphabet? And if the whole population starts to write in \nLatin script, will they be deported or repressed?\u201f The situation could be taken to absurd lengths, he \npointed out, for example, by publishing books and newspapers in the [adjacent] Mari Republic, \nwhere Tatar is not official and so can legally be written in any alphabet. \u201eThough we are not \nplanning to do that\u201f he said. He predicted that the law would rally more people to the cause of the \nLatin script (Malyutina (2002a) = Gazeta.ru, 15 November 2002). \n \nNot only Tatars were upset by the new law. Though aimed at Tatarstan, it would also affect Karelia, \na region adjacent to Finland where Karelian, similar to Finnish, is used (though currently not \nofficial). Federation Council member Viktor Stepanov from Karelia was reported as saying: \n\u201eTeaching Karelian on the basis of the Cyrillic alphabet will practically destroy the Karelian \nlanguage. In my opinion, we are intruding -- just like Lysenko was intruding on genetics -- we are \nintruding on the genetics of human consciousness\n15\u201f (Knox 2002b).  \n \nOpponents of the law now raised objections on the grounds of constitutional and human rights \nviolations. Nasif Mirikhanov, Tatarstan's representative to the Russian Federation, called the \namendment passed by the Duma a \u201eviolation of human rights.\u201f Boris Panteleev, a legal expert for \nthe Moscow-based Center for Journalism in Extreme Situations, argued that the Cyrillic-only law \nviolates several articles of the Russian Constitution, including one which states that \u201ethe Russian \nFederation guarantees to all peoples the right to preserve their native language and to create the \nconditions for its study and development\u201f  (RFE\/RL Russian Political Weekly, 20 November 2002). \nThe Tatar ethnologist Damir Iskhakov said he believed that the law contradicts the European \nCharter on Regional or Minority Languages, which aims to protect, preserve, and promote linguistic \nIdeology and Alphabets in the former USSR \n \n 23 \ndiversity (Knox 2002b), although the Charter does not specifically mention the use of scripts. \nFandas Safiullin told the media that the law ran counter to seven articles of the Russian Constitution \nwhich enshrine the right of preservation and development of national languages, and violated \ninternational law - in particular, the Convention for the Protection of National Minorities.   \n \nOn 29 November 2002 the Tatar State Council passed a resolution asking the Russian President, \nVladimir Putin, to veto the law. Deputies said it contradicted articles 15, 73, and 76 of the Russian \nConstitution, adding that, \u201eissues regarding the native languages of the titular peoples of the \nrepublics of the Russian Federation, which are fixed in their constitutions as state languages, and \ntheir alphabets come under the jurisdiction of the republics [themselves]\u201f. At the same time, the \nWorld Tatar Congress Executive Committee issued an appeal to President Putin, saying that the \nState Duma had created a new situation in which the ethnic majority was violating the ethnic and \ncultural rights of national minorities, among them Tatars. The congress said the amendment had \ncaused serious harm to federative relations in the country and had shaken the foundations of \nRussian statehood. (Gazeta. Ru 29 November 2002, RFE\/RL Daily Review from Tatarstan, 2 \nDecember 2002). \n \nIn November 2004 the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation handed down a ruling \nupholding the legality of the law. The Court considered objections from the Tatar State Council and \nthe Tatarstan Supreme Court together with a complaint from a Kazan lawyer. According to a court \nspokesman, the court determined that use of one alphabet or another was a federal issue, and the \nrepublic of Tatarstan had no right to decide to use a different alphabet for its language. For a region \nor locality within Russia officially to use an alphabet other than Cyrillic would require an \namendment to federal legislation. (RFE\/RL Newsline, 18 November 2004). The chief justice of the \ncourt, Valery Zorkin, was reported by RIA Novosti news agency as having said: \"The establishment \nof a single written alphabetic basis for all languages of the Russian Federation is ... in the interest of \nIdeology and Alphabets in the former USSR \n \n 24 \nsafeguarding the unity of the state.\" The Tatar president was quoted as responding philosophically: \n\"I would say that yesterday's decision by the Constitutional Court does not deprive Russian \nFederation subjects of the right to consider this issue -- it can be resolved through the adoption of a \nfederal law.\" (RIA-Novosti 17 November 2004).  \n \n4 Orthography and discourse: the language of the Tatarstan script dispute  \n \n4.1 Introduction \nEira (1998) provides a framework which is useful in understanding the Tatar alphabet dispute \nbecause it addresses itself in particular to disagreements over orthography choice. She argues that \n\u201ethe basis for orthography selection is fundamentally a question of the location of authority, which \nis in turn a function of the prevailing discourse\u201f (1998: 172). Where disputes arise, \u201edifferences of \nopinion at all levels reflect the underlying discourse in which they are framed [\u2026] an argument \nframed in terms of one Discourse is incoherent against an argument framed within another\u201f. A \nmismatch of discourses may lead to \u201eproblems in mutual understanding and respect\u201f (1998:174).  \n \nIf there is self-evidently a \u201eproblem in mutual understanding and respect\u201f between Moscow and \nKazan, we may try to trace it to the discourses with which each party is operating.  \n \nEira mentions six \u201ediscourse fields that impinge on orthography issues\u201f: scientific, political, \nreligious, technological, historical, and pedagogical. In the Tatar orthography dispute, we can find \nelements of all of these, though it is not easy to disentangle them. According to Eira, \u201eIn practice, \ndiscourses do not occur as predictable and neatly separable bases of opinion, but are interwoven in \nways peculiar to each culture\u201f.  In the remainder of this section I will examine some of the \nIdeology and Alphabets in the former USSR \n \n 25 \ncompeting discourses in this dispute, to explore what they tell us about how orthography has been \nconceptualised and deployed in the Tatar alphabet debate.  \n4.2 Unity and membership: the discourse of belonging \nScripts have always had strong associations with religions and the literacy practices connected with \nthose religions. This was certainly true within the Russian orbit, where the association between the \nOrthodox religion and Cyrillic was very powerful\n17\n. This was a major factor preventing the \nintroduction of Cyrillic to replace the Arabic script in the 1920s. The association of the Arabic \nscript with Islam is also strong. In the present dispute over the Latinisation of Tatar, however, we \ncan see that the associations of alphabet with nationhood and international relationships are much \nmore important than the associations with religion. Interestingly, the Latin alphabet is seen as being \nneutral in the sense that in this context, it does not have strong associations with one particular \ngroup \u2013 for example, Khasanova (1997) believes that \u201etoday's Tatars have a positive view of the \nLatin alphabet, which they see as an alphabet that is used throughout the world and which has been \nadopted voluntarily by many peoples as their national alphabet\u201f. At the same time, however, the \nLatin script is seen as being European as opposed to Russian. Thus Damir Iskhakov from the Kazan \nInstitute of History is quoted as saying that Latinisation reflects Tatars' belief that they belong to \n\u201eEurope-oriented civilization\u201f (Knox 2002a). \n \nIn spite of its global neutrality, in this particular context, the Latin script is now seen as closely \nlinked with the other Turkic languages, and a necessary part of any modern attempt to create a \nunified Turkic written language. According to the Tatarstan president  Shaimiev: \u201eTatars are part of \nthe Turkic world, and it would be wrong to remain outside this general trend\u201f (Khasanova 1997). \nThe Director of the Ibrahimov Institute of Linguistics, Literature and Arts, Mirfatykh Zakiyev, \nmade a similar point in a newspaper interview: a change [to Latin script] will help to unify the \nwritten language of the Tatars with the written language of other Turkic peoples. The change to \nIdeology and Alphabets in the former USSR \n \n 26 \nLatin script would not hinder this project, since the Cyrillic alphabet was unsuccessful in unifying \nthe form of many words in these languages (Ivashko 2002 = Gazeta. Ru 28 November 2002).  \n \nHere we can identify a discourse of \u201eunity\u201f with a specified group of people: \u201eEuropeans\u201f or the \n\u201eTurkic peoples\u201f. A similar discourse is used by the pro-Cyrillicists. On the one hand the Cyrillic \northography is linked to the integrity and unity of the Russian Federation: thus supporters of the \nlegislation emphasised that it would \u201eallow for the protection of the unified cultural and educational \nspace\u201f (Prokhorov 2002 = Gazeta. Ru 6 June 2002). The alphabet change was condemned as a \nthreat to the integrity of Russia (with the specific implication that Turkey was somehow involved).  \nAt the same time it is argued by some that retaining Cyrillic will maintain the unity of the Tatars \nthemselves: Latinisation \u201ewill cause a split in our society\u201f in the words of the Kazan petitioners. \nAccording to Kaadyr-ool Bicheldei (himself a Tuvin, not a Tatar), \u201eif Tatarstan goes over to the \nLatin alphabet, then only 2 million people, those living in the Republic itself, will write that way. \nBut 4 million Tatars who live elsewhere will not be able to do that, since the Latinisation law will \nonly apply on the territory of that region [Tatarstan]\u201f (Malyutina (2002a) = Gazeta.ru, 15 November \n2002). Even Tatar President Shaimiev expressed some doubts about the script change on the \ngrounds that it could keep Tatars living in other Russian regions away from Tatarstan, since no one \nwould introduce the Latin script outside Tatarstan. \"I signed the law on the gradual change to the \nTatar Latin script, but I'm still not quite sure it will be good for the Tatar people,\" he was quoted as \nsaying (RFE\/RL Daily Review from Tatarstan, 24 June 2002). \n \nRussia's supreme mufti, Talgat Tadzhuddin, used the same argument to claim that \u201ethe introduction \nof the Latin script could destroy the integrity of the Tatar nation and cause other nations in Russia to \noppose Tatars\u201f. He went further by drawing on a historical discourse by adding that he is \u201eproud of \nthe fact that Cyril and Methodius, the founders of the Cyrillic script, were Bulgars, and [that Tatars] \nshare historical roots with them\u201f (RFE\/RL Daily Review from Tatarstan, 23 July 2002).  \nIdeology and Alphabets in the former USSR \n \n 27 \n \nThus both proponents and opponents of the script change draw on a discourse of unity and \nbelonging. The Latin script serves various symbolic functions: it represents, depending on the \ndiscourse, (1) globalisation, (2) European civilisation, (3) Turkic language unity or (4) an unhealthy \nleaning towards Turkey (see below). Cyrillic is linked discoursally to (1) the Tatars, (2) the Russian \nFederation as a united entity and\/or (3) ancient historic links between Tatars and Slavic peoples. \n4.3 Technology and globalisation \nThe discourses of technology are closely linked to discourses of globalisation and difficult to \nseparate from them. According to Khasanova (1997), computer specialists have come out in favour \nof the Latin alphabet in preference to the Cyrillic alphabet, \u201ewith its relative isolation from the \nworld computer information system\u201f. Using the Latin alphabet \u201ewould make it possible for the Tatar \nlanguage to enter that system and to become an international language, and Tatar-speakers would be \nable to use the Internet without having to change fonts\u201f. Moreover, she says, there is currently a \nshortage of people with computer skills in Central Asia. Tatarstan universities offer training in this \narea, but changing to the Latin script \u201ewill give Tatar specialists a chance to exploit this advantage \nand become leaders among the Turkic peoples in the area of information technology\u201f. The director \nof the Ibrahimov Institute of Linguistics, Literature and Arts, Mirfatykh Zakiyev makes related \npoints:  \u201eThe Turkic peoples who have attained some degree of independence are gradually entering \ninto the global information system. But this is simpler to do on the basis of the Latin alphabet than \nthe Cyrillic. Furthermore, the Tatars can accomplish a changeover of this type considerably more \neasily than, for example, the Russians or Chinese, for whom the cost of changing scripts will be \nexcessively high\u201f (Ivashko 2002 = Gazeta. Ru 28 November 2002). \n \nIdeology and Alphabets in the former USSR \n \n 28 \nAnother reason for favouring the Latin alphabet may be the global pressure to learn English. \u201eThe \nenthusiasm for learning English\u201f is mentioned as one factor in the take-up of Latinisation in \nAzerbaijan (Bayatly 1997), because \u201ethe new alphabet is seen as a means to facilitate learning it.\u201f \n \nThe script change is thus explicitly linked not just to greater efficiency in terms of accessing the \ninternet and information technology, but to a more entrepreneurial desire to \u201erace ahead\u201f, to steal a \nmarch on users of other languages which have less internet-friendly scripts. Here we see also a \ndiscourse of commodification surrounding the Latin alphabet:  a discourse which is also familiar in \nconnection with literacy, whose benefits are \u201cclassically represented in terms of economic \u201etake off\u201f \nor in terms of cognitive skills\u201d (Street 1984:2). \n \nIronically, perhaps, this discourse is now also being used to advocate the Latinisation of Russian, \nthough only by a minority of intellectuals. One of the main advocates of this is Sergei Arutyunov, a \ncorresponding member of the Russian Academy of Science. Arutyunov has been cited a number of \ntimes in the Russian media as viewing the eventual transfer of Russian to the Latin alphabet as \n\u201einevitable\u201f. For example, he has said: \u201eI assume that the globalization and computerization of our \nlife will eventually lead to the Russian written language passing to the Latin alphabet in the present \ncentury. By itself the Latin alphabet is much more convenient than Cyrillic, which has many \ndeficiencies. If Russia wants to keep pace with the progressive world and become part of Europe, it \nmust completely go over to the Latin alphabet. Sooner or later the country will arrive at this \ndecision\u201f (http:\/\/exlibris.ng.ru\/kafedra\/2004-07-01\/6_alphabet.html)18. \n \n4.4 Cultural heritage: change and permanence \nA discourse about maintenance and loss of cultural heritage is a predictable part of every dispute \nover orthographic change. Opponents of the script change argue using a discourse of cultural loss: \nIdeology and Alphabets in the former USSR \n \n 29 \n\u201etraditions will be destroyed, new textbooks will have to be printed, .... It will cause a split in our \nsociety .... The link between generations will be broken,\u201f in the words of the Kazan petition \n(Section 3.3). In the German orthographic reform of the 1990s, which led to a constitutional \u201ecrisis\u201f \nin Germany itself (Johnson 2000), exactly this argument was used although the proposals only \naffected an estimated 0.5% of the lexicon (Johnson 2000:116) or 0.05% of all words in running text \n(Institut f\u00fcr deutsche Sprache, Mannheim: http:\/\/www.ids-mannheim.de\/reform\/richtig.html).  \n \nIn Germany many professional writers and members of the public opposed the changes on the \ngrounds that they would lead to a \u201eculture break\u201f. In Tatarstan, the debate has a more specifically \npolitical twist, according to Khasanova, as this argument is often put forward by Communists, who \nfear that the script change will be used to erase the history and culture of the Soviet period. \nAccording to her, the Tatar literati and intelligentsia favour a transition to Latin as \u201ea position of \nprinciple, since these writers are not concerned that their own literary works, written in the Cyrillic \nalphabet, could be lost to posterity if the Latin alphabet is adopted\u201f. Nevertheless it is also reported \nthat \u201ethe change has been bitterly opposed [\u2026] by some members of the older generation, especially \nthose members of the Tatar intelligentsia whose life's work is written in the Cyrillic script and who \nfear, with some justification, that it will be lost to future generations if the  alphabet changes\u201f (The \nJamestown Foundation Monitor, Volume 7, Issue 175. September 25, 2001).  \n \nClearly, this particular aspect of the change has caused problems for some of the intelligentsia, who \nstand to lose personally. It is also true that alphabet changes have sometimes been proposed for the \npurpose of expunging an undesirable body of literature\n19\n, so the fears may not be unjustified.  \n \nThe fact that all the Turkic republics used the Latin script during the 1920s has conveniently \nallowed proponents of the change from Cyrillic to adopt a discourse of permanence:  since the Latin \nscript was already adopted in 1927 in Tatarstan, the present-day script change is not really a change \nIdeology and Alphabets in the former USSR \n \n 30 \nat all. Rather, the Cyrillic period is treated as a sort of temporary detour which lasted six decades. \nAccording to the ethnologist Damir Iskhakov, since the use of Latin script was already agreed in \n1927, \u201ealthough this can look like a change, in actual fact it\u201fs just about a return to the line of \ndevelopment chosen by Tatar society in the 1920s\u201f (Knox 2002a). From this perspective, Tatar is \nnot making a \u201eculture break\u201f but returning, after an interval, to a (modernising) past. \n4.5 Cyrillic as \u2018defective\u2019; Cyrillic as a conduit for Russian lexis \nAccording to Khasanova (1997), the Tatar intelligentsia and literati \u201ehave always considered the \nmain defect of the Cyrillic alphabet to be that it does not correspond to the rules and peculiarities of \nthe Tatar language and distorts its pronunciation, creating conditions under which Tatars start \nmispronouncing their own language and native speakers of Russian have trouble learning to speak \nTatar properly\u201f (Khasanova 1997).  \n \nThere are actually three parts to this argument. (1) Cyrillic does not suit the Tatar language; (2) as a \nresult \u201edistortions\u201f come about in the way Tatar is pronounced even by native speakers; (3) native \nspeakers of Russian are misled by the similarities in the alphabet into mispronouncing Tatar. \n \nTo take the arguments in order: according to Rafail Khakimov, director of the Institute of History of \nthe Tatar Academy of Sciences a political consultant of the Tatar President and strongly identified \nwith the Latinisation policy, \u201eno language can tolerate certain sounds not being represented. But \nwith Cyrillic we lose three sounds. It\u201fs not at all suited for Tatar20\u201f (Panorama-Forum 2000, No. 23).   \n \nThis argument is reminiscent of the argument that the Arabic script is \u201eunsuited\u201f to the Turkic \nlanguages due to having insufficient vowel symbols. Though it appears to deploy hard linguistic \n\u201efacts\u201f  (\u201ewe lose three sounds\u201f) and thus to be justified on linguistic grounds, the rhetoric (\u201eno \nlanguage can tolerate\u201f) belies this. The same 'facts' could be used as grounds for advocating \nIdeology and Alphabets in the former USSR \n \n 31 \nretaining Cyrillic but reforming the orthography, for example, by using digraphs, diacritics or \nadding some characters. \n \nThe second argument, that using Cyrillic leads Tatars to \u201estart mispronouncing their own language\u201f \nis also used by Rafail Khakimov: \u201eWhat happens, when different sounds are represented by one \nletter? Urban children have started carrying a Russian pronunciation over into Tatar. What\u201fs more, a \ngeneration of teachers has grown up who speak Tatar with a Russian  accent\n21\u201f (Panorama-Forum \n2000, No. 23). \n \nIn this case, Cyrillic is being accused of being a conduit for Russian influence on the phonology of \nTatar. It is certainly the case that scripts can play an important role in facilitating lexical borrowing \nin the written register. This is because words which already have a standard spelling in the same \nscript as the borrowing language may be (though they do not have to be) incorporated without being \nrespelt to reflect the pronunciation in the new language. At an earlier stage in the development of \nTatar, \u201euse of the Arabic alphabet for the Central Asian Turkic languages facilitated the introduction \nof Persian and Arabic words and the diffusion of Persian and Arabic cultural influence throughout \nCentral Asia\u201f (Henze 1977:373); the same was true for other languages written in the Arabic script, \nsuch as Malay, which was originally written in the Arabic script and drew heavily on Classical \nArabic for its vocabulary. The large-scale incorporation of foreign words into a written language \ncan impact on the phonology of the spoken language, as long as there are bilinguals in the \npopulation who have access to the phonology of the source language. According to Vik\u00f8r (1988:47). \n\u2018The Classical Malay written language, as we know it, was to a large extent the product of an \nIslamic culture inspired by medieval Arabic civilization [...]\u201f. Arabic loan words permeated this \nAustronesian language, bringing the sounds of Arabic with them: of the 28 consonant phonemes in \nClassical Arabic, 14 did not appear in Malay prior to the Arabic influence (Vik\u00f8r (1988:47).   \n \nIdeology and Alphabets in the former USSR \n \n 32 \nIt was Soviet policy that Russian words should enter the Turkic languages spelt exactly as in \nRussian,  \u201eeven though the phonetic requirements of the local languages might normally demand \nthat changes in spelling should be attempted to conform to native pronunciation\u201f (Henze 1977:383).   \nThe mass importation of Russian vocabulary, written exactly as in Russian even when pronounced \ndifferently in Tatar, results in Cyrillic being seen as promoting Russian pronunciations of Tatar \nwords in a context where most Tatars are bilingual and biliterate in Tatar and Russian.  \n \nIt seems significant that here again the Cyrillic alphabet is blamed, rather than a process of language \nshift which has turned Tatars into bilinguals and made them in some cases more comfortable \nspeaking Russian than Tatar. The \u201egeneration of teachers\u201f who stand accused of speaking Tatar with \na Russian accent is surely more directly responsible than the writing system for any inadequacies in \npronunciation. \n \nThe third argument, that Cyrillic is the cause of bad pronunciations of Tatar by first-language \nRussian speakers, is mentioned in a newspaper interview by the director of the Ibrahimov Institute \nof Linguistics, Literature and Arts, Mirfatykh Zakiyev: \n \nThe use of a Cyrillic alphabet in the Russian and Turkic languages leads to the fact that the \nTurkic speakers get accustomed to their own way of pronouncing Cyrillic letters and their \ncombinations, and automatically transfer this pronunciation to the same letters or their \ncombinations in the Russian language. As a result, when Turkic speakers speak Russian they \nhave bad pronunciation. Incidentally the same happens when Russian (or Russian speaking) \npeople pronounce words in Turkic languages. But changing to the Latin alphabet will remove \nthis misunderstanding. (Ivashko 2002 = Gazeta. Ru 28 November 2002). \n \nIdeology and Alphabets in the former USSR \n \n 33 \nNo doubt it is true that many Russians pronounce Tatar badly, and many Tatars carry over Tatar \nphonology into Russian; but it is significant that the use of Cyrillic is blamed for this, rather than, \nsay, a lack of will on the part of the speakers to apply themselves to improving their pronunciation, \nor insufficient exposure to the languages pronounced correctly\n22\n. Other sociolinguistic possibilities, \nsuch as the development of local varieties of Tatar and Russian, are not part of this discourse either. \n \nWhile couched in the language of (popular) linguistics, the accusations against the Cyrillic script \ncan be seen as part of a discourse which seeks to make Cyrillic responsible for problems which at \nbottom are issues of second language learning and language shift. We are reminded that in a \nprevious era, the Latin script was blamed for a similar problem, cf. Serdyuchenko\u201fs account of why \nthe Latin script was dropped in favour of Cyrillic in the 1930s (see endnote 5): \u201eschoolchildren were \nlearning the Roman script for lessons in their mother tongue and the Cyrillic alphabet for work in \nRussian; they were often writing exactly the same words in the two different scripts. This did not \nmake the learning of languages any easier\u201f (1962:28). \n \nClearly, it is strongly felt by some that \u201echanging to the Latin alphabet will remove this \nmisunderstanding\u201f and allow Tatar to be pronounced as Tatar and Russian as Russian; but given \nthat the real problem seems to lie elsewhere, it is likely that the proponents of Latinisation will be \ndisappointed on this score. \n4.6 Latinisation as a threat to the integrity of Russia \/ the Russian language \nThe Moscow administration and its supporters did not shrink from calling the Latinisation of Tatar \na threat to Russia's national security and integrity\n23\n. But how was an issue, ostensibly of linguistics, \ndiscoursally turned into a matter of national defence? \n \nIdeology and Alphabets in the former USSR \n \n 34 \nA number of linguistic researchers have recently pointed out how issues within a society, which \nhave in themselves nothing to do with language, can be displaced on to language, making it the \napparent focus of disputes which in reality are over something else (e.g. Cameron 1995; Jaffe 1999;  \nJohnson 2000). Where there is unease within a society about aspects of social change, rather than \ndebate these directly, people may use language as a scapegoat \u2013 or rather, as a symbolic battlefield. \nIn Germany, for example, \u201eOrthography appeared to have become embroiled in a wave of more \ngeneral anti-reform sentiment. For this was only one of a number of reforms undergoing extensive, \ncontroversial and frequently inconsequential discussion at the time, e.g. [tax reform, health service \nreform, pensions reform, academic reform, land reform]\u201f (Johnson 2000: 123). \n \n We can see this working in a fairly literal way in the case of the Tatar script dispute, as a perceived \nthreat from Turkey (and perhaps more generally, from the Islamic world) was symbolically \n\u201eneutralised\u201f by making it illegal for Tatarstan to use its preferred script for Tatar. However, we \nmay see it on a more subtle level as well, for it turns out that language \u2013 in particular, the Russian \nlanguage - has recently been constructed as a national problem by politicians in Russia. \n \nThe Moscow Times of 27\nth\n June 2001 reported that \u201eThe government has approved an ambitious \nif still vague program to promote the Russian language and prevent a further slide in how the \nlanguage is written and spoken, especially by today's politicians and journalists [\u2026] In \npresenting the program to the Cabinet last Thursday, Education Minister Vladimir Filippov \ncalled for Russian to be purged of slang and foreign words and for governmental officials, \npolitical figures and journalists to be required to pass a spelling test\u201f (Johnson's Russia List, 27 \nJune 2001). \n \nA year later, almost at the same time as the first reading of the Cyrillic bill, the ruling party \nintroduced a bill aimed at regulating the public use of Russian and purging it of foreign words. The \nIdeology and Alphabets in the former USSR \n \n 35 \nChristian Science Monitor on 4\nth\n June 2002 quoted the bill's main author, Alexei Alexeyev, thus: \n\u201eThe Russian language is under attack from without and also from within. There are more than 100 \nnative languages spoken by the peoples of the Russian Federation, and in some of the larger ethnic \nrepublics attempts have been made to replace Russian as the official language [\u2026] We need a law \nto regulate language use.\u201f America is singled out as the source of the \u201eattack from without\u201f: \nYevgeny Chelishev, a member of the Language Council set up by President Putin, is quoted as \nsaying: \u201eIt's one thing to borrow words that express economic and cultural changes, but this \naggressive Americanization is something quite different [\u2026] Measures are long overdue.\u201f \nAccording to a government adviser, Mikhail Fyodorov, a co-author of the bill: \u201eYou may say that \nother problems, like the economy, seem more important than this, but we are convinced that it is \ncrucial to restore respect for the state language in Russia.\u201f (Weir 2002 = The Christian Science \nMonitor 4\nth\n June 2002) \n \nThe bill required Russian officials, journalists and advertisers to speak and to write literary Russian, \non pain of fines for failing to observe rules, swearing, or using foreign words where Russian \nsynonyms already exist. Specifically forbidden were \u201evulgar, derogatory and abusive words and \nexpressions\u201f24, not just in official talk but also in \u201epublic appearances, inscriptions on signs, \ngeographical names and the designations of organizations\u201f. Between the first and second readings \nthe bill softened somewhat: journalists gained the right to deviate from the standard language for \nartistic reasons (not defined in the bill). No penalties were set for transgressions, this being left to \nfuture legislation. (Malyutina 2002b = Gazeta.ru 14th December 2002). \n \nThe discourse of this language bill is quite similar to that of the bill on Cyrillic: its authors \u2013 one of \nwhom was Kaadyr-ool Bicheldei, the proposer of the legislation on Cyrillic \u2013 describe its aim as \u201eto \nprotect and develop the Russian language in the territory of all Russia, which will promote the  \naugmentation and mutual enrichment of the spiritual culture of its peoples\u201f27. We find here again the \nIdeology and Alphabets in the former USSR \n \n 36 \nlanguage of unity, of the \u201eunified cultural and educational space\u201f with the Russian language at its \nheart.  \n \nThe bill had its second reading in December 2002, soon after the Cyrillic bill.  It was approved by \n371 votes with no votes against and only two abstentions \u2013 remarkable for a piece of legislation in \nwhich, according to one journalist, \u201eRussian parliamentarians [\u2026] showed the world their feeble-\nmindedness by passing the most curious law about the Russian language, which never will begin to \nwork\u201f28 (Malyutina 2002b = Gazeta.ru 14th December 2002). However, the bill fell at the last \nhurdle: the upper legislative house, the Federation Council, reviewed and rejected it during its \nspring session in 2003 (RFE\/RL Newsline, 03-06-27). \n \nThe intense activity surrounding language in the Russian parliament not only suggests that there is a \ngood deal of insecurity about the condition of the Russian language. It also seems to reflect \ninsecurities about other aspects of the social structure in the much-changed former Soviet state. We \ncan now see the law enforcing Cyrillic as part of a more general attempt to \u201erestore respect for the \nstate language in Russia\u201f in the face of threats from \u201ewithin\u201f (for example, Tatarstan) and \u201ewithout\u201f \n(the U.S.A. and the Islamic world).  \n \n5 Concluding remarks \nLaws establishing official languages are common, but legislation requiring all languages within the \nboundaries of a state to use specific alphabets is rare. Even during the Stalin era, Cyrillic was \nimposed on each nationality separately, if at all; there was no attempt to legislate for a single \nnational alphabet. Indeed, at that time it would have been all but impossible, since languages of the \nUSSR like Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian used the Latin script by long tradition, while others \nlike Georgian and Armenian had their own scripts with long histories. The law requiring Cyrillic for \nIdeology and Alphabets in the former USSR \n \n 37 \nall official languages within Russia is therefore something new in the region\u201fs history, but is also \nmore or less unprecedented anywhere in recent times\n29\n. \n \nAt one level we can interpret the row over scripts for Tatar as a struggle between an imperial centre \nand a wayward peripheral state which the centre felt it must bring to heel. In this case, the struggle \nis over symbolic goods \u2013 cultural property - rather than, say, the oil with which Tatarstan is well \nsupplied, and which is of great importance to the Russian economy.  \n \nFrom a different perspective, the dispute can be seen as a debate over the rights and obligations of \nstates, language communities and individuals. An often-used argument against the Tatar script \nchange is that Tatarstan, having only a minority of all Tatars as its citizens, cannot legislate for a \nlanguage which is widely spoken beyond its jurisdiction. The government of the Russian Federation \nhas finessed this further by insisting that although citizens have a constitutional right to use and \ndevelop their native language, the state has an obligation to regulate language for the public good. \nA major reason given for introducing the law on Cyrillic was to preserve a unified cultural and \neducational space, or as Kaadyr-ool Bicheldei put it, \u201eprotecting the rights of citizens to education \nand access to information\u201f ((Gazeta.ru, 15 November 2002). Moreover, they would say, the state\u201fs \ninterventions in this area are legitimate: in Loginov\u201fs words, \u201ewriting can be regulated by the law \ninasmuch as it is an element of a social contract and if everyone invents his or her own writing, it \nwould lead to chaos in the state\u201f. \n \nThere is clearly an issue of interpretation here. If linguistic minorities have the right to use and \ndevelop their own languages, is this overridden by a duty to know and use the main official \nlanguage as a language of wider communication? Does the state have no obligation, or at most a \nlimited obligation, to provide education and services in minority languages? That seems to be the \nimplication, for otherwise, one might argue, citizens\u201f \u201erights to education and access to information\u201f \nIdeology and Alphabets in the former USSR \n \n 38 \ncould best be exercised in their native languages. The argument that minorities are best served by \nbeing required, even forced, to use the majority language is an old one, currently being reinvented \nin many countries including Britain and the United States.  \n \nStreet (1984) identified competing models of literacy which he calls \u201eautonomous\u201f and \u201eideological\u201f. \nIn Sebba (1998) I argued that it is possible to identify \u201eautonomous\u201f and \u201eideological\u201f models of \northography along similar lines. For Street, the \u201cautonomous\u201d model of literacy is based \u201con the \nassumption that [literacy] is a neutral technology that can be detached from specific social contexts\u201d \n(1984:1). This model \u201cisolates literacy as an independent variable and then claims to be able to \nstudy its consequences... classically represented in terms of economic \u201etake off\u201f or in terms of \ncognitive skills\u201d (Street 1984:2). An alternative model of literacy, which Street calls \u201eideological,\u201f \nfocusses on the \u201especific social practices of reading and writing,\u201f recognising \u201ethe ideological and \ntherefore culturally embedded nature of these practices.\u201f (Street 1984:1) \n \nI argue that an autonomous model of orthography treats phonology as if it were the only aspect of \nlinguistics relevant to writing systems. Scripts themselves are treated as capable of evaluation and \ndeployment independently of social or cultural considerations\n30\n. Rather than being seen as an \nintegral part of the language culture of the community concerned, the writing system is thought of \nas a neutral technology which can be adapted and altered to serve the needs of its speakers. The \ndominant discourse within this model favours phonemic writing systems above all other types. The \nmost important criterion by which suitability of a writing system is judged, is the extent to which it \nprovides a one-to-one correspondence between phonemes and characters. Only when this criterion \nis satisfied are extralinguistic factors sometimes brought into consideration. \n \nIt follows from this dominant view of orthography that where several competing alphabets are \navailable, the choice should be made first on the grounds of how well they satisfy the criterion \nIdeology and Alphabets in the former USSR \n \n 39 \nmentioned above. In the debates of the first part of the 20\nth\n century, the Arabic script was an early \ncasualty largely because it failed to provide sufficient vowel symbols. \n \nChoosing between Latin and Cyrillic, on the other hand, is more difficult because in both cases, \nlinguists attempted to provide a reasonable fit between the available symbols (introducing \nadditional ones where necessary) and the sounds of the language concerned, though with varying \ndegrees of success. The Cyrillic alphabets developed for the Turkic languages, as well as some of \nthe alphabets based on the Latin one\n31\n, have been criticised as deficient in this respect. However, \nthere is not a big difference between the two writing systems in terms of their potential adequacy \nfor representing the Tatar language. Nor has either alphabet a very long history of use for writing \nTatar (though Cyrillic has the edge over Latin in this respect). In order to make a case for or against \nsupplanting one with the other, each side has needed to develop discourses which support its case. \n \nThe readiness of the Russian Federation and Tatarstan to introduce legislation regulating the form \nof script to be used indicates that both the Russian and Tatar authorities subscribe to an autonomous \nmodel of orthography. It may be that the recent history of the Central Asian languages, with three \ndifferent alphabets in use in the first half of the 20\nth\n century, has given an impetus to this view of \nalphabets as \u201edetachable\u201f from the cultures which use them. Certainly, it is hard to imagine most \nother multilingual states coolly imposing an alphabetic regime the way that the Russian Federation \nhas just done.  \n \nFar from being \u201eneutral technologies,\u201f scripts have symbolic power which transcends language \nitself. We can see this in virtually every dispute over alphabets, orthography or spelling reform. \nOrthographies readily become symbolic of national or group identity (Schieffelin and Doucet 1994, \nBird 2001, Eira 1998, Johnson 2000). In the case of the Tatar alphabet changes, the two writing \nsystems have come to stand in symbolic opposition to one another. Whether the Russian \nIdeology and Alphabets in the former USSR \n \n 40 \nFederation\u201fs legislation is successful in curbing the Tatar script \u201erebellion\u201f or not only time will tell. \nWhat we can certainly say is that even if the World Tatar Congress Executive Committee has over-\ndramatised a little by saying that Moscow\u201fs law on Cyrillic has \u201eshaken the foundations of Russian \nstatehood\u201f, the consequences of Tatarstan\u201fs attempted alphabet reform go far beyond the realms of \nphonology. \n \n6 References \n \nAnderson, B.

In the \ncontext of the former USSR conversion to the Roman alphabet is usually called \u201eLatinisation\u201f rather than \n\u201eRomanisation\u201f though the terms are identical in meaning. \n \n2\n See for example Tauli as an example of a linguist who insists that \u201eabsurdities\u201f resulting from the \u201eprejudices\u201f of \u201ethe \nnatives\u201f should be combated (1968:131). \n \n3\n Alphabet reform had been an issue in Russia for some time, and the Cyrillic alphabet itself had been reformed almost \nimmediately after the first of the 1917 revolutions (before the Bolshevik (October) revolution). Progressive individuals \nhad in practice already implemented these reforms privately. \n \n4\n  In other words, there was a project to create a common \u201eprint-language\u201f in the sense of Anderson (1983\/1991). \n \n5\n  Henze cites Sir Olaf Caroe, diplomat and colonial administrator, as the source of this hypothesis. \n \n6\n Cf. the following account by G.P. Serdyuchenko (1962:28): \u201eThese written languages in the Soviet Union were \noriginally formulated in Roman script. The end of the thirties, however, saw much more attention being paid to the \nteaching of Russian in schools, and this meant that schoolchildren were learning the Roman script for lessons in their \nmother tongue and the Cyrillic alphabet for work in Russian; they were often writing exactly the same words in the two \ndifferent scripts. This did not make the learning of languages any easier, and at the end of the thirties nearly all the \npeoples of the Soviet Union formulated their written language on the basis of the Cyrillic\u201f.  \n \n7\n For example, Tatarstan\u201fs President Mintimer Shaimiev told the the Second Congress of Tatars in Kazan in 1997 \u201ehow, \nin 1939, \"without any discussion, and without consulting the Tatar intelligentsia, the Tatars were forced to adopt the \nCyrillic alphabet which, in large part, does not conform to the rules and spirit of Tatar speech.\"\u201f (Khasanova 1997) \n \n8\n  Gazeta.ru ironically headlined the article using Latin script: \u201eU Azerbaijana problemy s latinitsey\u201f (Azerbaijan has \nproblems with the Latin alphabet). \nIdeology and Alphabets in the former USSR \n \n 48 \n                                                                                                                                                                  \n \n9\n A more positive account of the alphabet change in Azerbaijan, and some recent historical background, can be found in \nan online account by Bayatly (1997). \n \n10\n According to Lepr\u00eatre (2002),  the Russian Federation is made up of 89 entities of which 32 are defined according to \nethnic terms. However, the titular nationality (group from which the state takes its name) constitutes the majority only \nin 8 of the 21 Republics. \n \n11\n According to Reznik (2001), \u201eat the First All-Union Turcological Congress in Baku in 1926 the delegates from the \nTatar Republic fought vigorously for the retention of the Arabic script for the Tatar language, in spite of the universal \ncampaign for Latinisation. Polivanov wrote in 1928 that Kazan, with its long traditions of Arabic script writing and \npublishing, remained the stronghold of the opposition to Latinisation (Polivanov 1928 as cited by Alpatov 1997: 65)\u201f. \n \n \n12\n  Tatarstan deputy Fandas Safiullin explained in response to this accusation that there would  not be a return to the \n1927 alphabet simply because  it was not completely suited to the contemporary Tatar language, as it had too many \nartificial signs. So letters of the Turkish alphabet would be incorporated into the national language.

This would produce a great moral change in India \nin the course of a generation or two. Nothing keeps India in a state of moral and intellectual debasement so much \nas the false religion, false morals, and false science contained in the sacred and learned books of the \nMahammadans and Hindus; and by getting rid of these we shall stop the polluted stream at its source.

(Bird 2001:152) \n \n31\n  Though Cyrillic is compared unfavourably with the Yanalif, it must be pointed out that the new Tatar alphabet is \ndifferent from the Yanalif and relatively untried at the moment. Other updated versions of the Yanalif have been found \nto be unsatisfactory, e.g. in Uzbekistan (cf. Schlyter 2001: 2.2). \n \n"}
