While there is anecdotal \nspeculation to support the inference that recruitment to surgical trials is more \nchallenging than for medical trials we are unaware of any formal assessment of this.  \nIn this paper, we compare recruitment to surgical and medical trials using a cohort of \npublicly funded trials.   \n \nData:  Overall recruitment to trials was assessed using of a cohort of publicly funded \ntrials (n=114).

For the trials where the comparison was \nbetween a surgical and a medical intervention, the Recruitment Index was \nsubstantially higher (n=6, 68.3 (23.5, 294.8)) versus (n=93, 34.6 (11.7, 90.0); median \ndifference 25.9 (-35.5, 221.8); p=0.291) for the other trials. \n \nConclusions:  There was no clear evidence that surgical trials differ from medical \ntrials in terms of recruitment activity. There was, however, support for the inference \nthat medical versus surgical trials are more difficult to recruit to.  Formal exploration \nof the recruitment data for surgical trials through a modelling approach may go some \nway to tease out where important differences exist. \nBackground \nGood recruitment is integral to the conduct of a high-quality randomised controlled \ntrial.  However, many trials struggle to recruit to their original target in terms of both \ntime and budget[1-3].  It has been suggested that recruitment is particularly difficult \nfor evaluations of surgical interventions, a field in which there is there is a dearth of \nevidence from randomised comparisons[4-6]. Strong preferences amongst surgeons \nand potential participants, as well as limitations on resources both infrastructure \n(theatre time) and staff availability (surgical team), have been highlighted as possible \nexplanations.  \n \nA surgical trial can be defined as a trial undertaking a randomised comparison of a \nsurgical procedure against some form of control. Various options are available for the \ncontrol, including where viable, a surgical placebo. In general, surgical trials can be \nconsidered to fall into three levels of increasing difficulty to conduct:  \n\u2022 Level 1 - randomised comparisons of surgical procedures which differ only in a \nminor way (eg a comparison of two methods of suturing)[7] \n\u2022 Level 2 - randomised comparisons of different forms of surgery which differ in a \nsignificant way in terms of the overall approach and skills required (eg a \ncomparison of laparoscopic surgery versus open surgery for inguinal hernia)[8]  \n\u2022 Level 3 - randomised comparisons of some form of medical management versus \na surgical intervention (eg proton pump inhibitors versus fundoplication for \ngastro-oesophageal reflux disease)[9] \nIssues of patient preference and clinical equipoise are likely to be greatest where the \ndifference between comparisons is greatest[10]. \n  \nWhile there is anecdotal speculation to support the inference that recruitment to \nsurgical trials is more challenging than for medical trials, we are unaware of any \nformal assessment of this. The aim of this work was to use empirical data to assess \nwhether there is evidence that recruitment to surgical trials is more difficult than for \nmedical trials. Two aspects were considered, overall recruitment to the trial (trial \nlevel) through the assessment of a cohort of trials, and recruitment at the centre level \nthrough three example surgical trials. \n \n \nMethods \nWe assessed recruitment to surgical trials in general by testing two pre-specified \nhypotheses on data from a cohort of publicly funded trials. We firstly hypothesised \nthat surgical trials would be more difficult to recruit to and therefore they have a \nhigher level of recruitment activity than medical trials (Hypothesis A) and secondly \nthat the surgical trials of greater complexity (as defined earlier) would similarly lead to \na higher level of recruitment activity (Hypothesis B).  \n \nTo test hypotheses A and B, we used a simple measure of recruitment activity for \nmulticentre randomised controlled trials, the Recruitment Index[11], which is defined \nas the average number of days taken to recruit a participant in a centre: \n \ntsparticipanNo\ncentresNoeriodcruitmentPRI\n.\n.Re \u00d7=  \n \n \nFor example, a trial which recruited 100 patients in 200 days over 5 centres would \nhave a RI of 10 (average number of centre recruitment days per recruit). We \ncalculated the RI for a cohort of publicly funded trials to measure the level of recruit \nactivity for surgical trials. The RI was calculated on the basis of the actual number \nrecruited as opposed to the number completing the trial protocol which was not \nconsistently recorded. We tested for an overall difference between surgical and \nmedical trials to assess hypothesis A. Level 3 trials versus the remaining trials was \ntested to assess hypothesis B. \n \nFor hypothesis generating purposes, and to illustrate complexities of multicentre \nrecruitment within surgical trials, two hypotheses were tested on three example \nsurgical trials. First, we hypothesised that late starting centres would recruit less than \nearly starting centres (Hypothesis C). Second, we hypothesised that the rate of \nrecruitment within centres would reduce during the course of the trial (Hypothesis D). \n \nAll hypotheses were tested using a Mann-Whitney U test at the 5% significant level in \nSPSS[12]. The Recruitment Index, the number recruited and the rate of recruitment \nwere summarised as median and interquartile range (IQR). A 95% confidence \ninterval for the median difference was calculated in STATA[13]. \n \n \nData \nCohort \nThe STEPS project carried out a review of publicly funded trials from two UK funding \nbodies, the UK NHS R&D National Methodology Programme and the UK Medical \nResearch Council (MRC)[2]. All multicentre centre trials except for cluster \nrandomised trials were included. Data was collected on the 114 multicentre trials, \nwhich recruited between 1994 and 2002, on recruitment and finance details from \napplications forms and progress reports. Where insufficient data was available in the \nSTEPS database a search for trial publications was undertaken to collect additional \ndetails which may not have been available when the original search was conducted. \nFor individual trials recruited to more than one randomised comparison, only the \ncomparison with the largest target recruitment was considered. Though UK funded, \n25 (22 %) of the trials also had centres based outside the UK.  A pilot study had been \nundertaken for 60 of the Trials (53 %). Two reviewers independently categorised the \ncohort as either a surgical or medical trial (Table 1). Any differences were resolved \nby consensus.  \n \nExample trials \nCentre level recruitment data was available for three surgical trials, one representing \neach of the three levels of surgical trials. Basic information on the three surgical trials \nused to assess multicentre recruitment is given in Table 2. The trials differed in size \nand clinical area.  \n \n \nResults \nCohort \nThe Cohort included trials from a variety of clinical areas (including Cancer, HIV\/AID, \nurology, primary care and mental health) and setting (hospital, community and \ngeneral practice). Trial varied greatly in their target recruitment between 60 and \n66000. The number of centres, number of participants recruited and the time \nrecruiting (start of recruitment to end of recruitment is given in Table 1 for surgical \nand medical trials. \n \nThe Recruitment Index was found to be higher, though not statistically significantly, in \nthe surgical group (n=18, median=38.0 IQR (10.7, 77.4)) versus (n=81, median=34.8 \nIQR (11.7, 98.0)) days per recruit for the medical group (median difference 1.7 (-19.2, \n25.1); p=0.828). For trials which compared a surgical against a medical comparison \n(level 3), the Recruitment Index was substantially higher (n=6, 68.3 (23.5, 294.8)) \nversus (n=93, 34.6 (11.7, 90.0); median difference 25.9 (-35.5, 221.8); p=0.291) for \nthe other trials. \n Example trials \nThe results for Hypotheses C & D are given in Tables 3 and 4 respectively. Two of \nthe three trials supported hypothesis C that latter centres do not recruit as well as \nearly centres. The median rate of recruitment for latter centres was approximately a \nhalf that of the early centres for trials 1 and 2. \n \nAll 3 tended towards a reduction in the rate of recruitment within centre (Hypothesis \nC) with one significant at the 5% level and one just failing to be so. Substantial \nreductions in the number of participants recruited were observed between the first \nhalf of centre\u2019s recruitment period and the second half (Hypothesis D). \n \n \nDiscussion \nIn general, there was no clear evidence that surgical trials differ from medical trials in \nterms of recruitment activity. There was, however, support for the inference that \ncomplex (level 3) surgical trials are more difficult to recruit to. We suggest that the 3 \nlevels of surgical trials is a useful paradigm for understanding the variation in \nrequired recruitment activity between surgical trials.  \n \nThe Recruitment Index is a simple measure of the recruitment rate for a multicentre \ntrial. We found that the index varied greatly between trials and it might be the case \nthat a more nuanced measure may be more sensitive to differences between trials. \nFor example, extending the measure to the centre level might provide a more \naccurate picture of recruitment as centres may have staggered start dates.  \n \nThe exploratory centre level analysis illustrated that recruitment is a complex process \nwithin a trial and emphasised the variation in recruitment both between and within \ncentres. Hadich et al[14] previously demonstrated a difference between late starting \ncentres and early centres for AIDS trials and we found a broadly consistent pattern. \nThere was also some evidence of slowing down in recruitment during the trial period.  \n \nPatient preference is often the most notable reason for recruitment being difficult to \nsurgical trials[15]. Surgical treatment polarises participant attitudes for and against \nsurgery. Further research is needed to investigate whether other factors also play a \npart and to what degree recruitment strategies can improve participation rates for \nthese trials. \n \nThere were a number of limitations to our study. To enable calculation of the \nrecruitment index we used the number of participant randomised. This ignored the \nquality of data on those included in the trial. The need for long-term followup to \nevaluate surgical interventions has been highlighted and consideration of retainment \nof participant was not assessed[5]. Though we looked at a large cohort of trials there \nwas a relatively small number of surgical trials available. Similarly, we only \nconsidered three surgical trials at the centre level and therefore cautious \ninterpretation is needed. It is uncertain whether our results would hold for commercial \nas opposed to publicly funded trials and investigation of this is warranted. \n \nConclusions \nWe found no clear evidence to support the assertion that recruitment to surgical trials \nin general is more difficult than other clinical areas.  However, complex (medical \nversus surgical) trials appear substantially more difficult to recruit to.  Formal \nexploration of the recruitment data for surgical trials through a modelling approach \nmay go some way to tease out where important differences exist and could inform \nfuture trial design.  \n \n \nReferences \n[1] Lovato LC, Hill K, Hertert S, Hunninghake DB, Probstfield JL.
