It was found that attendance at peer learning was \npositively and significantly correlated to academic performance. This relationship was \nfound even when prior levels of academic performance were controlled for. However, it \nwas also found that students who attended peer learning adopted statistically significant \nless meaning orientated approaches to studying over the course of the academic year. It is \nargued that this is an indication that the quality of the learning of these students fell. \nQualitative evidence suggests that this change in approach was in response to an \nincreased awareness of the assessment demands of the course and that these students had \nbecome more strategically orientated in their approach to studying as a result of their \nattendance at Peer Support. It is argued that these results suggest that the outcomes and \noperation of this Peer Support scheme were influenced by the context in which it \noperated. Two implications of these findings are discussed.  \n \nKey Words \nPeer Learning \nPeer Support \nSupplemental Instruction (SI) \nApproaches to Studying \nFurther Education \n 3 \nPeer Support: Relations between the context, process and \noutcomes for the students who are supported  \nThe aim of this study was to investigate the approaches to studying and the academic \noutcomes of students who were supported in a Peer Support scheme. The effects of the \ncontext, particularly of assessment, on the processes and outcomes for these students of \nthis Peer Support scheme were also examined with the aim of gaining some insight into \nthe nature of the learning that could be expected in Peer Support schemes of this sort.   \nDefining terms \nPeer learning is used here as a generic term which refers to situations where students \nsupport each other in educational settings. Other authors have used terms such as \u201ePeer \nTutoring\u201f (Goodlad and Hirst 1989, Topping 1996), and \u201ePeer Teaching\u201f (Goldschmid \nand Goldschmid 1976, Whitman 1988). The term \u201epeer learning\u201f is used to emphasise the \nexperience of all students participating. Two forms of peer learning, Supplemental \nInstruction (SI) and Peer Support, are considered in this paper. Although peer learning \ninvolves students who support other students, it is the impact of peer learning on the \nstudents who are supported that is the focus of this paper. The impact of peer learning on \nthe students who offered support in this context is considered in Ashwin (in press).  \nA summary of past reviews of the research into the effectiveness of peer learning \nPeer Support, the peer learning scheme reported in this paper, was based on \nSupplemental Instruction (SI). SI is a form of peer learning that was first established at \nthe University of Missouri, Kansas City in 1973 (see Blanc et al. 1983, Martin and \nArendale 1993, Center for Supplemental Instruction 1998). In SI, the peer learning \n 4 \nsessions take place outside the mainstream curriculum with the SI users\u201f attendance at the \nsessions being voluntary. The role of the peer facilitator (SI leader) is to facilitate \ndiscussion of the course material between the students whose learning is facilitated (SI \nusers) rather than to lecture to them. The SI user\u201fs role is, therefore, to take an active part \nin providing the material for the session, whilst the SI leaders are responsible for \nstructuring the discussion.  \n \nThe US research suggests that SI users gain higher mean grades than non-users \n(Lundeberg 1990, Bridgham and Scarborough 1992, Congos and Schoeps 1993, Kenney \nand Kallison 1994). This is found even when previous academic achievement and \nethnicity (Center for Supplemental Instruction 1998), and double-exposure to the course \nmaterial (Kenney 1989) are controlled for.  The evidence from Europe and South Africa \nis less strong but suggests that those students who attend SI do better than those students \nwho do not (Rye et al. 1993, Bidgood 1994, Healey 1994, Price and Rust 1994, 1995, \nBryngfors and Bruzell-Nilsson 1997, McCarthy et al. 1997).  \n \nThere are two issues with the way this research is reported that have led to a lack of \nconsideration of the impact of the context in which SI schemes operate on the process of \nthe schemes and their outcomes. First, it is usually assumed that the SI schemes operate \nin the way that the implementer initially planned them, in terms of the structure of the \nsessions and the nature of the interaction between the students involved in them. The \nstudies cited above simply include a generic description of an SI session, such as \u201cThe SI \nleader facilitates the discussion so that students can make adjustments, discuss what they \n 5 \ndo not understand and discover strategies for mastering difficult material\u201d (Center for \nSupplemental Instruction 1998), without investigating the actual processes within the \nsessions. Whilst more qualitative studies have considered the interaction between SI \nleaders and SI users (Lundeburg and Moch 1995), and how SI operates in particular \nsubject areas (McMillin 1993, Burmeister et al. 1994, Zerger 1994), these studies have \nnot investigated student outcomes. Second, the focus in these studies has been on the \nimprovement in students\u201f academic performance. There has been no consideration of the \nways in which students are assessed and whether an improvement in students\u201f academic \nperformance is also an indication of an improvement in the quality of students\u201f learning, \npartly because this relationship can only be investigated in a single context. This study \nattempts to address these issues by examining the way in which a Peer Support scheme \noperated, examining the quality of the learning of the students supported, and by \nexamining the effect of the context on the process and outcomes of Peer Support for the \nstudents supported by the scheme. \nResearch methods  \nThe form of peer learning, Peer Support, which was the focus of this research, operated \non a two year \u201eA\u201f level science course at an inner-city further education college from \nOctober 1997 to May 1998. It was based on SI, with second year students, Peer \nSupporters, taking on the role of SI leaders and the support being offered to first year \nstudents who took on the role of SI users. Support was offered in Chemistry and Pure \nMathematics and Statistics.  \n \n 6 \nThe research triangulated methods to examine the extent to which students with particular \nlevels of prior academic achievement and approaches to studying used Peer Support and \nthe relation between attendance at Peer Support and students\u201f academic performance and \napproaches to studying at the end of the academic year. The outcomes were related to the \nactual structure of the Peer Support sessions, feedback from the Peer Supporters, and the \nassessment methods of the course, to examine the relations between the context in which \nthis Peer Support scheme operated, the way in which it operated, and its outcomes for the \nstudents who were supported.  \nStudents\u2019 previous academic performance and performance in their end of year \nexaminations \nThe relationship between students\u201f previous academic performance and their levels of \nattendance at Peer Support was examined using the first year students\u201f GCSE results. \nRather than including all their GCSE results in this analysis, it was narrowed to their \nperformance in the following: Mathematics, Science subjects (whether this be single \nScience subjects like \u201eChemistry\u201f or the Science double award which covers all the \nScience subjects), and English Language. These are referred to as \u201eMSE GCSEs\u201f and \nwere used because there was a significant and strong positive correlation between the \nMSE GCSE score and students\u201f performance in their Chemistry and Pure Mathematics \nand Statistics promotional examinations, which they sat at the end of their first year of \n\u201eA\u201f level study (Chemistry, r = +0.57. N= 44, p< 0.001; Pure Mathematics and Statistics, \nr = +0.50. N = 23, p < 0.01). Students with overseas qualifications were not included in \nthis analysis. GCSE scores were available for 49 out of the 52 students who were \nstudying first year Chemistry and\/or Pure Mathematics and Statistics. The prior academic \n 7 \nperformance of the students was also examined by splitting the students into two groups. \nThe first, Peer Support Users, was defined as those students who attended five or more \nsessions, and non-Peer Support Users as those students who attended less than five \nsessions. Five sessions was chosen because evidence from the SI literature suggests that \nthat is the minimum required for SI to have any positive impact on student performance \n(see McCarthy et al. 1997).  \n \nThe first year students\u201f performance in their end of year promotional examinations in \nChemistry and Pure Mathematics and Statistics were also examined. Spearman\u201fs rank \norder correlation were used to examine if the students who attended more Peer Support \nsessions achieved higher marks in their end of year Chemistry and Pure Mathematics \npromotional examinations. \nApproaches to studying questionnaire \nRichardson\u201fs (1990) version of the Approaches to Study Inventory (ASI) (Entwistle and \nRamsden 1983), the Approaches to Studying Questionnaire (ASQ) was used to measure \nthe extent to which students adopt a meaning and a reproducing orientation in their \nstudies. Richardson (1990) found that this was \u201creliable and replicable, and can be \nrecommended for use in future investigations into student learning\u201d (p. 165). It can be \nseen as a measure of the quality of students\u201f learning because meaning orientated \napproaches to studying lead to higher quality learning than reproducing orientated \napproaches to studying (for example see Kember et al. 1997).  \n \n 8 \nThe first ASQ was distributed to students studying Chemistry and Pure Mathematics and \nStatistics in October 1997. The response rate was 73%.  The students\u201f meaning and \nreproducing scores on their first ASQ were examined to see if there was a relationship \nbetween these and their levels of attendance at Peer Support. The second ASQ was \ncompleted in June 1998. In total, 35 students completed the first and the second ASQ, an \noverall response rate of 67%. In both cases, the questionnaire was distributed and \ncompleted during students\u201f lessons. A comparison of the prior educational attainment and \nresult in the end of year examination, between those students who completed both ASQs \nand those students who did not, revealed no statistically significant differences between \nthe groups using a Mann Whitney test. Thus, on the measures used in this study there \nappeared to be no systematic differences between those students who completed both of \nthe ASQs and those who did not. \n \nThe measurements from the ASQ were taken to examine whether there was a relationship \nbetween changes in the students\u201f scores on their second ASQ, compared to their first, and \ntheir level of attendance at Peer Support. A similar questionnaire has been used by \nKember et al. (1997) to evaluate other educational innovations in terms of increasing \nstudents\u201f participation in their learning experience. The change in students\u201f meaning and \nreproducing orientation scores were analysed using a Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test and, as \nwith previous academic achievement, dividing the students into groups of Peer Support \nUsers and Non-Peer Support Users.  \n 9 \nObservation of Peer Support sessions \nThree of the Peer Support sessions were observed over the academic year, one session in \nNovember 1997, one in February 1998, and one in May 1998. The purpose was to \nexamine the nature of the interaction between the Peer Supporters and the students \nsupported. The students attending these sessions differed with 17 students attending the \nfirst session observed, 25 the second observed, and 20 the final session. However, 13 of \nthe students attended all three of the sessions that were observed. This suggests that it is \npossible to compare how the interaction between the students and the Peer Supporters \ndeveloped over time, rather than differences in the sessions being due to differences in \nthe students attending.   \nFocus group with Peer Supporters \nA focus group discussion was conducted with four of the five Peer Supporters. The Peer \nSupporters discussed a series of questions relating to their experience of acting as Peer \nSupporters and the experience of the first year students. To allow for the possibility that \nsome students might not express their opinions in full in a group setting, the students then \nwrote individual responses to the questions. The discussion was recorded and transcribed \nverbatim. The quotes from the discussion in this paper were selected on the basis that \nthey represented views that were expressed consistently in the discussion and in the peer \nfacilitators\u201f individual responses to the questions. \nExamination of Peer Supporters\u2019 journals \nDuring their time as Peer Supporters, the students kept a journal of each of their sessions. \nThis has been done in previous studies on peer learning (Lundeberg and Moch 1995, \n 10 \nJohnson 1995). In their journals the Peer Supporters were asked to analyse what they \nplanned to do in their sessions, what they felt actually happened in the sessions, and what \nthey would like to improve in subsequent sessions.  \nPeer Support on the first year of \u2018A\u2019 level Chemistry and Pure Mathematics and \nStatistics  \nBefore examining which students used Peer Support and whether these students seemed \nto gain from their involvement in Peer Support, the way in which it actually operated is \nexamined. This is important in examining whether the apparent outcomes of Peer Support \ncan be reasonably argued to have been due to the type of activity and interaction that \nactually occurred in the sessions. It is important to note that it is the actual interaction \nrather than the planned interaction that is to be examined. This will also give an \nindication of how the sessions developed over time. \n \nFive Peer Supporters were trained in October 1997 to offer support to the 52 students \nstudying first year Chemistry and\/or Pure Mathematics and Statistics. The Peer Support \nsessions took place during the free time of both the groups of students and the first year \nstudents\u201f attendance at each of the sessions was voluntary. The Peer Supporters ran 34 \nsessions; 44 students attended at least one session, 24 of these attended at least five times, \nand 19 attended at least ten times. In terms of attendance per subject, 19 of the 47 \nstudents studying Chemistry attended at least five times, and 16 of the 25 students \nstudying Pure Mathematics and Statistics attended at least five times. The average \nattendance at the sessions was 19.8 students.  \n  \n 11 \nIt is important to note that the approach to training the Peer Supporters differed from that \nof training SI leaders, where the focus is on training students in particular group work \ntechniques (Center for Supplemental Instruction 1998). Instead, based on several years \nexperience of running peer learning in the college, students were introduced to, and \ndiscussed, their role as Peer Supporters and their views of how to best support their \nfellow students. They each ran a practice Peer Support session and discussed how they \nwould run their first sessions. They worked with their own models of how they would run \ntheir sessions; the idea was that these would be discussed and developed over time in the \nweekly meetings involving the author and the Peer Supporters. At the end of the training \nit was agreed that the Peer Supporters would organise the sessions so that they worked in \none large group. It was also agreed that they would discuss particular concepts that \nstudents had recently been taught and were finding difficult to understand. However, as \nthey ran the sessions, the Peer Supporters found that more students would attend if they \nfocused on getting the students to discuss how to answer past examination questions and \nif they split the large group into smaller groups of students who were interested in \ndiscussing the same questions. In the sessions that were observed, the small groups of \nstudents attempted a series of past examination questions on their chosen topics that were \nprovided by the Peer Supporters. The Peer Supporters and students who attended Peer \nSupport appeared to change their understanding of their roles over the three sessions that \nwere observed. In the first session observed the students were reluctant to talk and when \nthey did they addressed all their comments to the Peer Supporters. In the later sessions \nthe students would discuss the questions with each other once the Peer Supporters had \ninitiated the discussion.  \n 12 \n \nExamples of how two of the Peer Supporters\u201f journals changed over time demonstrate \nhow their perception of the participation of the students who were supported changed \nover time. These were representative of the journals kept by the five Peer Supporters. \nAfter the second session, on the 16th October 1997, the Peer Supporters focused on two \nimprovements: \n\u201cGetting everyone to participate and co-operate.\u201d (Arvinder1, Session 2 Journal, \n16\/10\/97) \n\u201cTrying to get them to listen to each other and co-operate instead of talking all \nat once. Try to get the quieter students more involved somehow. They sit and \nwatch but don\u201ft take part. I think they\u201fre unsure of the answers and don\u201ft want \nto be wrong.\u201d (Sajida, Session 2 Journal, 16\/10\/97)) \n \nThe Peer Supporters\u201f journals suggest that they overcame the problems of participation \nand co-operation relatively quickly. This was illustrated by the entries in the \u201eWhat did \nyou do well?\u201f section of their journals: \n\u201cGot everyone to participate, even the quiet ones. Also got the louder, more \nconfident students to show respect to students who did not understand first \ntime round.\u201d (Arvinder, Session 5 Journal, 13\/11\/97) \n \n\u201cThey also learnt about working together as they took it in turns to answer \nquestions. I think that this was the best session I had so far, as usually I have \n 13 \nto keep asking questions and lead discussion but today they were working and \ntalking amongst themselves.\u201d (Sajida, Session 7 Journal, 27\/11\/97).  \n \nIn their focus group discussion the Peer Supporters confirmed the way in which the \nstudents who attended Peer Support and their understandings of the sessions developed \nover time. However, in this discussion they suggested that it took longer than was implied \nin their journals.  \n \nSajida and Arvinder outlined in the focus group discussion how the students who \nattended Peer Support initially came looking for answers, and the Peer Supporters \nresponded by talking for most of the sessions: \n\u201cSajida: I thought we were teaching them a lot more in the beginning. If they \ndidn\u201ft understand something in the class they wouldn\u201ft ask [the teachers] for \nhelp, they would come to us. So in the beginning we used to talk continuously \nfor an hour and it was really tiring. \nArvinder: They thought the whole point of this Peer Support was for us to \nteach.\u201d \n \nThe Peer Supporters explained how they developed the sessions to be more interactive, \nand how the students who attended Peer Support began to understand that the Peer \nSupporters were not teachers: \n 14 \n\u201cSajida: I think after Christmas we said \u201eYou have to at least try and read it up \nyourself rather than coming straight to us\u201f . . . We asked them to explain it to \nthe others, rather than us explaining it to them. \nJavid: Some of them understood it more than others and they wanted to just go \non and [in the later sessions] they realised they just couldn\u201ft go on at their \nown speed, that they had to be more tolerant of others. \nArvinder: We were always asking the not so confident person to talk and said \n\u201ehold on there\u201f to the others, \u201ewe know you know it so slow down and give \nthe others a chance\u201f. \nTunde: I think they got to understand what a Peer Support leader was. They \ndidn\u201ft understand it as first. I think they got to understand that we are not \nteachers, we are just second year students.\u201d \n \nTo conclude this section, the observation of the Peer Support sessions and the focus \ngroup discussion with the Peer Supporters suggest that the sessions differed from the way \nthey were initially planned. Rather than being focused on the discussion of difficult \nconcepts, they appeared to be focused on discussing how to answer past examination \nquestions. The sessions developed over time. The initial sessions involved the Peer \nSupporters providing answers, whereas in the later sessions the students who attended \nPeer Support shared their understanding of the examination questions with one another, \nwith the Peer Supporters giving these discussions structure and focus.  \n 15 \nThe relationship between students\u2019 prior academic achievement, approaches to \nstudying and their levels of attendance at Peer Support  \nThese relationships were investigated because it could be argued that the students who \nare willing to spend time attending activities such as Peer Support will be the more able \nstudents or students who have more meaning orientated approaches to their studies (for \nexample, see Norton and Crowley 1995 on the types of students who attended learning to \nlearn workshops). However, there was not a significant correlation between students\u201f \nmean MSE GCSE scores and their attendance at Peer Support (r = +0.15, N= 49, p>0.10). \nEqually, there was no statistically significant relationship between students\u201f meaning and \nreproducing orientation scores at the beginning of the academic year and their attendance \nat Peer Support, although there is a weak correlation suggesting that the more students \nattended Peer Support, the lower their reproducing orientation scores (meaning \norientation score r = -0.02, N = 38, p > 0.10; reproducing orientation score r = -0.25, N = \n38, p > 0.05).  \nThe relationship between students\u2019 academic performance at the end of the \nacademic year and their levels of attendance at Peer Support \nThere were statistically significant positive correlations between students\u201f attendance at \nPeer Support and their performance in the end of year examinations (Chemistry, r = \n+0.30. N= 47, p<0.05; Pure Mathematics and Statistics, r = +0.56. N = 25, p<0.005).  \n \nTable I shows the correlation between first year students\u201f attendance at Peer Support and \ntheir performance in their Chemistry and Pure Mathematics and Statistics Promotional \n 16 \nexaminations for the Top 25%, middle 50% and bottom 25% of students based upon their \nability as measured by their MSE GCSE scores.  \n \nTABLE I ABOUT HERE \n \nIt shows that there are significant positive correlations between students\u201f attendance at \nPeer Support and their marks in the Chemistry Promotional examination at all three \nlevels of ability, as measured by previous academic achievement. This shows that at all \nlevels of ability range the more Peer Support sessions students attended, the better they \nperformed in their end of year examination. In the Pure Mathematics and Statistics \nexamination it is the students who are in the middle 50% and top 25% for whom there is \na significant positive correlation between attendance at Peer Support and their \nperformance in the end of year examination. The correlation between attendance at Peer \nSupport and the marks for the Pure Mathematics and Statistics examination for the \nbottom 25% of students is positive, though it is not significant. Thus, it is likely that, at \nall levels of previous academic achievement, the more Peer Support first year students \nattended the better they did in their end of year examinations. \nThe relationship between students\u2019 approaches to studying at the end of the \nacademic year and their levels of attendance at Peer Support \nStudents\u201f scores on the ASQ were used as a measure of the quality of students\u201f learning \nin this study. In theory, Peer Support could have helped students to develop their \napproaches to studying and improve the quality of their learning for two reasons. First, it \ncould help to prevent negative attitudes to study and help those supported to organise \n 17 \ntheir study methods. Some argue (Clarke 1986, Watkins and Hattie 1985) that it is these \nelements of the reproducing orientation that have the largest negative effect on the quality \nof learning. Second, Ramsden et al. (1989) found that educational institutions in which \nstudents felt there was supportive teaching, coherent structure, an emphasis on autonomy \nand a moderate stress on achievement, tended to produce students who took a more deep \napproach to learning, which is part of a meaning orientation. Peer learning can be seen as \na way of promoting a supportive environment and so in this way may help students to be \nmore meaning orientated in their learning and so improve the quality of their learning.  \n \nContrary to this theory, there was a small, but statistically significant, fall in the mean of \nthe Peer Support Users meaning orientation scores from 60.1 to 57.2 (T = 34.5, N = 18 p \n< 0.05). There was no significant change in their reproducing orientation, or the meaning \nand reproducing orientation of the Non-Peer Support Users.  \nRelating the Context, Process and Outcomes of Peer Support \nThe statistical evidence has suggested that the more students attended Peer Support, the \nbetter they did in their end of year examinations. This relationship was found even when \nprior levels of academic achievement were controlled for. However, there is also \nevidence that the quality of students\u201f learning, as measured by their approaches to \nstudying, fell slightly.  Relating the context in which this Peer Scheme operated to the \nprocesses and outcomes of Peer Support offers an explanation for this apparent \ncontradiction. This is that the students took a more strategic but less meaning orientated \napproach to their learning. Entwistle (1997) describes this as an \u201cintention to achieve the \n 18 \nhighest possible grades, while the process depended on cue seeking, well organised study \nmethods and effective time management\u201d (p.19).  \n \nThe Peer Support sessions were consistent with Entwistle\u201fs definition. They focused on \nsupporting students in practising past examination papers. This was a change from the \noriginal focus sessions, which was to be on discussing difficult concepts. This change \nappeared to occur because this is what the first year students wished to discuss in the \nsessions. The first year students\u201f promotional examinations, as with the actual \u201eA\u201f level \nexaminations, had question topics and formats that were repeated over the years. This \nmeant that learning to tackle the types of questions that would be set in an examination, \nrather than seeking a deep understanding of the course content, could be a successful \napproach to studying the course.  The data from the focus group with Peer Supporters \noffered support for this interpretation of the statistical evidence. The Peer Supporters felt \nthey had helped the students who attended Peer Support to become aware of how to \napproach the course and how to tackle past examination papers. It appears that they were \nhelping the students who attended Peer Support to understand the cues of their teachers \nand the assessment methods: \n\u201c Javid: They did not have much of an idea about the syllabus... \nTunde: At first they didn\u201ft really ask us for past papers but once they knew \nwhat Peer Support was they knew they could come and ask us for past papers. \nArvinder: It\u201fs good to get it started off straight away rather than just learning  \n[examination] technique at the end. During the two years you need to learn the \n 19 \ntechnique itself. Having knowledge is one thing but knowing what they want, \nthe examiners themselves, that progresses over the two years.  \nSajida: A lot of them didn\u201ft really know about past papers or where you can get \nthem or anything. \nTunde: Some of them didn\u201ft really know what the course was like. \nSajida: \u201eCause going from GCSE to A level is a really big jump and its a lot \nharder and you\u201fve got to do a lot more work, there are a lot doing it just how \nthey did it at GCSE.\u201d \n \nThis focus on examinations was emphasised by one of the Peer Supporters in the focus \ngroup discussion when he was comparing Peer Support with teaching. \n\u201cArvinder: Talking amongst yourselves develops ideas [but] you need \nsomething to trigger it off and that\u201fs usually teachers themselves. You need \nthat introduction, you need that background. You need to know what you are \ndoing before hand; you can\u201ft just talk about anything. You\u201fve got to relate it \nback to the syllabus, relate it back to work. At the end of the day you\u201fre doing \nyour exams, you\u201fre not discussing.\u201d \n \nIf the students who attended Peer Support became very focused on using examination \npapers and the books that the Peer Supporters recommended then it seems likely that they \nbecame less questioning in their approach to the course. It appears that it was the \nstructure of the course, and particularly assessment procedures, that led to the focus on \npast papers that was observed in the sessions. Sessions of this type would encourage \n 20 \nstudents to adopt an approach that would secure success in examinations at the cost of \ndeeper understanding of the material they were studying. This suggests that the process \nand outcomes of this Peer Support scheme were affected by the context in which it was \noperating.  \nConclusions \nIn this paper, a form of peer learning appeared to be effective in improving students\u201f \nacademic performance on an \u201eA\u201f level Science course. The context in which the form of \npeer learning operated also appeared to influence its process and outcomes. If these \nfindings were confirmed in other contexts and in relation to other peer learning schemes, \nthen this would have two implications for those interested in peer learning. First, it would \nsuggest that in researching different forms of peer learning it is essential to collect and \ntriangulate a variety of quantitative and qualitative data in order to gain insight into the \ncontext in which forms of peer learning operate. Any data on students\u201f academic \nperformance would need to be related to the operation of the form of peer learning, \nstudents\u201f experience of that form of peer learning, the type of course that is being studied, \nand the quality of students\u201f learning in order to gain a fuller picture of what is happening \nin each particular context. Second, it would suggest that whilst peer learning can improve \nstudents\u201f academic performance, it works by helping students to come to terms with the \ndemands of their courses. It reflects the demands of these courses and cannot be expected \nto produce radical changes beyond these courses\u201f learning outcomes. Thus peer learning \ncould never be a panacea for poorly designed courses and assessment systems but rather \nwould be an effective way of helping students to succeed in meeting the demands of their \ncourses.  \n 21 \n \nHowever, this was a single study of one form of peer learning in one context. Several \nfactors such as the impact of students\u201f motivation on their use of Peer Support were not \nexamined in this study.  It is clear that further studies of the relationship between \ndifferent forms of peer learning and their contexts are needed, if we are to understand \nfurther the influence of the teaching and learning context on the operation of peer \nlearning. \nNotes \n1.
