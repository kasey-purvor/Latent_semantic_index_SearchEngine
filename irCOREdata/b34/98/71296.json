This paper\nadopts an intermediate scale, focusing on the old county of Westmorland to\nexamine the geographical and chronological patterns of enclosure before looking\nmore closely at some of the problems involved in creating a new landscape.\nIntroduction\nParliamentary enclosure and its landscapes are a familiar element in English agrarian\nhistory. Over 7m acres, around 21 per cent of the area of England, was affected, of which\nsome 2.3 million acres were waste rather than open-field arable.1 Some of this land\ncomprised lowland commons, heathlands and wetlands, but much of it was upland\nwaste. Cumbria had the highest proportion of unenclosed upland waste of any region of\nEngland in the later eighteenth century.2 Between 1760 and 1830 nearly a quarter of the\nregion was enclosed under parliamentary act, only a tiny fraction of which was open field\narable.3 While there has been some research on the parliamentary enclosure of upland\nwaste in England and Wales4 this topic still receives little attention in some recent\naccounts of parliamentary enclosure.5 Many aspects of the processes involved, and their\nimpact on the landscape, are also poorly understood. This paper focuses on the old\ncounty of Westmorland to examine the geographical and chronological patterns of\nenclosure before focusing on some of the problems involved in creating a new landscape.\nParliamentary enclosure in Westmorland: general patterns\nWestmorland was described by Defoe as \u2018the wildest, most barren and frightful of any\n(county) that I have passed over in England, or even in Wales\u2019.6 However, this statement\nconceals major contrasts in topography and landscape within the county. The uplands of\nWestmorland range from some of the highest and most rugged fells in the eastern Lake\nDistrict to the steep scarp face and peaty plateaux of the Cross Fell range. Between them\nRural History (2003) 14, 1, 21\u201338.*c 2003 Cambridge University Press 21\nDOI: 10.1017\/S0956793303000025 Printed in the United Kingdom\na curving band of limestone forms a series of plateaux and valleys stretching from Shap\nto Kirkby Stephen, offering considerable scope for improvement. South of this lay the\nflat topped but steep sided Howgill Fells. Between the uplands were valleys with more\nfertile soils, particularly in the Eden valley, while to the south of the county, around\nMorecambe Bay, were extensive areas of lowland peat moss and salt marsh ripe for\nreclamation.\nIn 1800 Westmorland had the highest proportion of its land in waste \u2013 79.7 per cent \u2013\nof any English county.7 Over 129,000 acres still remains as upland common pasture but\nbetween the late eighteenth and late nineteenth centuries over 101,000 acres, some 21\nper cent of its area, was enclosed by parliamentary act. Most of this was upland waste\nand common pasture. It is impossible to calculate a precise figure for the area enclosed as\nmany awards did not give an accurate total surveyed acreage.8 With such acts the area of\nallotments, quarries and public watering places can be totalled to give a fairly accurate\nfigure but the amount of land occupied by public and private roads is rarely given.\nThe origins of parliamentary enclosure in Westmorland lie in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, with evidence of interest from the 1760s.9 One influence was probably activity\nin neighbouring Cumberland, where seven acts relating to over 16,000 acres of common\npasture had been passed before 1770 and six awards completed, and Lancashire, where\nthirteen acts covering over 5,500 acres, including some in the north of the county, had\nbeen passed and completed by 1770.10 A more local influence is likely to have been\nenclosure agreements arranged privately without recourse to Parliament. The amalga-\nmation and enclosure of open field arable strips by private agreement was a long-\nestablished process in Westmorland so that by the late eigheenth century there was very\nlittle land left in open field.11 Such agreements were also being used to divide and\nenclose areas of pasture. At least four instances are recorded in the county before 1770.\nThe earliest known so far, the division of a 130-acre stinted pasture called Low Close in\nthe township of Morland, occurred in 1756.12 Although this enclosure process is\nrecorded by only a brief and simple document, the task of surveying and dividing the\nland was undertaken by three local yeomen from other parishes in roles analogous to\nthose of parliamentary enclosure commissioners. It is probable that this and other\nsimilar privately-arranged enclosures were developments of earlier less well-documen-\nted agreements.13\nIn particular the privately-agreed enclosure in 1769 of the commons in the township\nof Crackenthorpe near Appleby may have provided the catalyst which precipitated the\nfirst burst of parliamentary enclosure in Westmorland during the 1770s.14 Although the\nlord of the manor of Crackenthorpe, Richard Machell, was a relatively small landowner,\nhis lands adjoined the estates of the earl of Thanet, an absentee landlord whose land\nagent in Appleby, Thomas Heelis, was one of the witnesses to the Crackenthorpe\nagreement. It is unlikely to be a coincidence that the first enclosure under parliamentary\nact to be completed in north Westmorland, the year after the Crackenthorpe enclosure,\nwas for the adjoining township of Brampton, or that Thomas Heelis was a commis-\nsioner.\nParliamentary enclosure in Westmorland involved 97 acts, spread over more than a\ncentury from 1767 to 1879. Figures 1 and 2 show their distribution. Table 1 shows the\n22 Ian Whyte\nParliamentary Enclosure in Westmorland 23\nF\nig\nu\nre\n1\n.\n24 Ian Whyte\nFigure 2.\namount of enclosure accomplished by decade. The dates relate to the enclosure awards\nrather than the passing of the acts as these reflected more closely the date at which the\nbulk of the work of enclosure actually took place. Enclosure occurred in three main\nbursts: the first in the 1770s and the second during the Napoleonic Wars, paralleling\ntrends further south though continuing later to a peak in the 1820s.15 Unlike southern\narable areas, however, there was also a third peak in the mid nineteenth century.\nThe first parliamentary enclosure act in Westmorland, dating from 1767, was for 158\nacres of land on Kendal Fell, immediately outside the borough of Kendal. Both the\npurpose and the procedure involved were unusual. The aim was to enclose the land,\nwhich belonged to the town, and rent it out to provide an income which would help\nfinance street improvements and poor relief in the borough. The enclosed land was\noverseen by a board of twelve trustees, elected by the inhabitants of Kendal.16 Two\nother more conventional enclosure acts, for Reagill and Shap, were also passed in 1767\nbut due to the deaths of the commissioners nothing was done and new acts to enclose the\ncommons in these manors had to be passed in 1803 and 1813 respectively.17 The earliest\nenclosure act to be completed for a substantial area, Orton in 1769, took ten years to\naccomplish and caused major problems because of the way in which it was handled.\nMuch of the late eighteenth-century burst of enclosure occurred in the Eden Valley,\nparticularly on lowland commons where the quality of the land was relatively high,\nmainly on soils of the Clifton and Brickfield 3 associations, which needed careful\ndrainage but were inherently fertile.18 Most of these commons were in manors belong-\ning to the earl of Thanet who was actively building up his estates around Appleby Castle\nat this period.19 Searle has suggested that the principal reason behind the enclosure of\nCumbrian commons at this time was the damage which was being done to them by\noverstocking linked to the cattle droving trade, and the inability of manorial courts to\nParliamentary Enclosure in Westmorland 25\nTable 1\nEnclosure of waste in Westmorland over time\nby date of award\n1770s 9,618 acres 9.5%\n1780s 0 0\n1790s 723 0.7\n1800s 1,536 1.5\n1810s 14,515 14.4\n1820s 25,375 25.2\n1830s 4,524 4.5\n1840s 10,629 10.5\n1850s 20,788 20.6\n1860s 6,435 6.4\n1870s 2,157 2.1\n1880s 641 0.6\n1890s 4,075 4.0\nTotal 101,016 100.0\nSource: Tate and Turner (1978).\nregulate such abuses effectively.20 However, there is strong evidence that around\nAppleby, the most important grain market in Westmorland at this time, the primary\naim behind the enclosure of this relatively good land was the conversion of pasture to\narable.21 This is hinted at by provisions in the awards themselves. The ban on keeping\nsheep in the new enclosures for seven or even ten years to prevent damage to young\nhedges, a clause that featured in most of the 1770s acts from the Eden valley, was also\nan incentive to use the land for arable, as was the stipulation, in awards like Great\nOrmside (1773) and Bongate and Burrells Moor (1774) that land within the new\nenclosures that was sown with cereals should pay only half tithes of grain for the first\nseven years.\nBecause tithes were not completely extinguished on some of the earliest enclosures\ntheir land use at the time of the tithe surveys in the 1830s and 1840s can be examined.\nTable 2 shows the high proportion of land under crop at this time on the enclosed lands\nof Brampton, Brougham and Temple Sowerby with lower, but still significant, figures in\nless well-drained Crackenthorpe and Sandford. Where enclosure had been undertaken\non poorer soils at slightly higher altitudes, as in Bleatarn, Great Ormside and King\u2019s\nMeaburn, where a belt of soil occurred which was described as being a \u2018cold ungrateful\nclay, very profitless to the farmer\u2019,22 the percentage of arable was much lower. The\nproportion of land in cultivation in the cases mentioned above may well have fallen\nsubstantially from the early years of enclosure for Webster mentions Bleatarn and Great\nOrmside among the areas in which crop returns soon declined with much land being left\nto revert to pasture after 1815.23 Poor management and overcropping was a feature of at\nleast some of this land. Hutchinson, writing in 1794, described the enclosure of land in\nareas like Sowerby some twenty six years before. The new fields had borne luxuriant\ncrops for a few years but soon became worn out with too much liming and too many\ncereal crops.24\nThe lack of enclosure in the south of the county during the 1770s was probably due to\nthe fact that there was much less waste on lower lying good-quality land around Kendal\nthan in the environs of Appleby. The Kendal district, however, shared in the burst of\n26 Ian Whyte\nTable 2\nUse of enclosed land as recorded in tithe surveys of some North Westmorland townships\nDate Date of Arable and Arable and\nenclosed tithe % Arable pasture meadow\nBleatarn 1791 1846 34 16\nBrampton 1772 1841 76 7\nBrougham 1776 1839 85\nBurrels 1776 1843 18\nCrackenthorpe 1769 1843 53\nGreat Ormside 1773 1845 24 27\nKing\u2019s Meaburn 1779 1841 13\nSandford 1773 1844 52\nTemple Sowerby 1774 1840 96\nenclosure during the Napoleonic Wars where a good deal of higher land was taken in\nwith the aim of extending the arable area. There is little doubt that high grain prices\nwere an important influence on this burst of enclosure activity. A price series for wheat\nand oatmeal sold in Lancaster market from 1801 shows that prices had reached high\nlevels before the Peace of Amiens in February 1802; wheat was selling at 95 shillings and\noatmeal 67s. 9d. per load of 4.5 Winchester bushels. Prices dropped to 50 and 24\nshillings respectively during the peace but rose steadily from 1808 to reach a peak of 103\nshillings for wheat and 97s. 3d. for oatmeal, described as \u2018famine prices\u2019 in the autumn\nof 1812. Prices remained high until the end of 1813 then began falling slowly though\nwith another peak early in 1817 when oatmeal cost 72 shillings per load.25 Much of the\nstraight, narrow ridge and furrow which can still be seen on such areas of former waste\nwas probably created at this time. A good deal of this was on soils of the Eardiston 1\nassociation, loamy, well-drained brown earths developed mainly on limestone, easily\ncultivated but vulnerable to over-cropping.26\nAs in the late eighteenth century the cultivation of newly-enclosed land was often too\nintensive. The 1801 crop returns for Morland, west of Appleby, stated that high grain\nprices had encouraged farmers to plough newly enclosed land to a greater degree than was\nconsistent with good husbandry.27 Around the head of Morecambe Bay a good deal of\ncoastal wetland was also drained and enclosed, giving rise to some of the most regular\nenclosure landscapes in the county. This burst of enclosure in Westmorland was less\nprominent than in neighbouring Cumberland, perhaps because of the lack of local urban\nand industrial markets.28 Nevertheless, its impact was significant. In July 1815 the\nLancaster Gazette recorded that over 8,000 acres of waste had lately been brought in\ncultivation in Westmorland. The effect of this on Kendal market had been striking. The\ncounty had become a net exporter of grain whereas formerly it had been a net importer.29\nThe third burst of enclosure, from the 1820s to the mid nineteenth century, was\nlinked almost entirely with the improvement of pasture, mainly for sheep farming,\nencouraged by the general enclosure act of 1845 which speeded up the process and\nreduced costs. The spread of the railway network provided much faster access to the\nmarkets of industrial south Lancashire, Yorkshire, the North East and even London for\nlivestock and livestock products. In this area, livestock farming remained fairly prosper-\nous until the very end of the nineteenth century.30\nConsiderable capital was sometimes invested in improving such land. On the large\nallotment received by the earl of Lonsdale on Shap Fells with the award of 1820, over\n1,200 acres were improved by liming and c.1,500 acres by tile draining, converting it\ninto improved pasture.31 In addition, two large areas of common, Crosby Garret and\nStainmore, rather than being enclosed, were subject to regulation under an act of 1876.32\nThis provided a cheaper alternative to enclosure on relatively poor-quality land with the\nintroduction of stinting on formerly unregulated waste land and the formalisation of\naccess and peat cutting rights.\nEnthusiasm for improvement was tempered by the poor quality of much of the land\ninvolved. Some acts deliberately excluded areas of rough pasture which were so high\nlying that there would have been no profit, and much needless expense, in enclosing\nthem. At Dufton, under the escarpment of Cross Fell, an extensive area was left out of\nParliamentary Enclosure in Westmorland 27\nthe act for this reason. At Casterton the highest parts of Casterton Fell were included\nwithin the act but with the proviso that allotments in this area did not have to be fenced\nand that the boundaries of the former common only needed to be established and\nmarked. At Hutton Roof the extensive pastures on areas of limestone pavement were left\nunenclosed and simply converted from an unregulated common to a stinted pasture. A\ndraft map for the Preston Patrick enclosure, c.1814, marks the higher lying allotments as\n\u2018unploughable\u2019, probably due as much to poor drainage as to altitude.33\nThere were marked contrasts in the history of enclosure at a local level. The enclosure\nof Orton, for example, was begun in 1769 while the award for the manor of Asby\nWinderwath, on the other side of the watershed, was not made until 1874, and the parish\nof Crosby Ravensworth, adjoining them both, was never enclosed at all. The differences\nin subsequent land improvement and grazing management between high-quality grass-\nland on the Orton side of the boundary and heather moorland on the Crosby Ravens-\nworth side is striking today. At this scale differences in patterns of land ownership and\nsocial structure could produce very different decisions regarding whether or not to\nenclose, but the identification of such contrasts is di\u0081cult.\nAdvantages of enclosure\nThe advantages of the enclosure of upland waste and commons in this area, as already\nmentioned, have been seen principally as the removal of the problem of deterioration of\ncommons by over-grazing, especially through the agistment of livestock from outside\nthe community.34 The removal of peat and turf from commons was also damaging. At\nBolton in the early nineteenth century it was agreed that, as a result of this, if the\ncommon was not enclosed soon it would be ruined.35 But it has also been shown that,\nparticularly during the 1770s and the Napoleonic Wars, enclosure allowed the conver-\nsion of suitable, and sometimes less suitable, land to arable. Where land of reasonable\nquality was converted to arable the cost of enclosure could be paid off in two or three\nyears.36 Other advantages included the ability to improve pasture in individual owner-\nship by liming and of livestock by selective breeding.37\nAnother potential use for enclosed land was afforestation. This was undertaken on a\nlarge scale in parts of the Lake District, notably by John Christian Curwen at Claife on\nthe west side of Windermere and by the Bishop of Llandaff at Gummers How at the\nsouth end of the lake.38 Where the quality of the soil was relatively low but the degree of\nexposure moderate a significant proportion of the land on some awards was planted,\nespecially in the low undulating country east of Windermere. Large moorland allot-\nments, in the Pennines rather than the more rugged Lake District, could be turned into\ngrouse moor.39 Grouse shooting does not appear to have provided a significant incentive\nfor enclosure until after the middle of the nineteenth century.\nAn additional advantage for those with rights on commons which adjoined the\nsettlements of Bowness and Windermere was that enclosure allowed plots of land to\nbe sold off for the construction of villas and mansions for well-to-do incomers. The\nhigher ground above the east side of Windermere, which was enclosed in 1822, provided\na number of ideal viewpoints for such houses.40\n28 Ian Whyte\nEnclosure ended the depletion of the resources of commons by unauthorised\nencroachments, a widespread problem on Cumbrian commons.41 Enclosure may also\nhave reduced the theft of sheep and it certainly stopped the practice of \u2018dogging\u2019, using\ndogs to drive off neighbours\u2019 sheep from the best parts of commons. This was\nmentioned by Webster42 as being a widespread abuse in Westmorland and is supported\nby cases such as one from Sleagill in 1802 which went to the Quarter Sessions in\nAppleby where Matthew Ewbank drove off two hundred sheep and two hundred lambs\nbelonging to George Shaw so that fifty animals were lost and fifty killed, the remainder\ntaking a lot of time and trouble to round up.43 At Casterton dogging was done\nparticularly by the larger farmers who were attempting to monopolise the common.44\nEnclosure also removed other problems relating to commons such as boundary disputes,\ndisagreements over intercommoning between townships, arguments over who had\ncommon rights, and the straying back to their original pastures of hefted sheep which\nhad been sold to other local farms.45\nAnother benefit of enclosure was the improvement of transport by turning frequently\nimpassable local tracks into good all-weather roads. The public and private roads laid\nout by surveyors of highways acting for the enclosure commissioners facilitated the\nimport of lime for agricultural improvement and the marketing of produce, as well as\nimproving communications between neighbouring communities. At a local level they\nhad as great an impact as the turnpikes on a regional scale.46\nOpposition to enclosure\nWho were the promoters of enclosure and how much opposition did they experience? It\nhas been suggested that in Cumbria, in contrast to the Midlands and southern England,\nthere was general accord between major landowners, gentry and farmers over the\ndesirability of enclosure as a result of the deterioration of the commons.47 In part this\nwas because of the strength of the customary tenants who formed a high proportion of the\noccupiers of land inWestmorland, with rights effectively equivalent to freeholders. In fact\nin somecases at least itwas the customary tenantswhowerepushing their lord of themanor\nto initiate enclosure proceedings. The practice of selling a proportion of a common to pay\nfor the expenses of the enclosure, which occurred in about half the Westmorland awards,\nalso made enclosure less of a financial burden for smaller owner occupiers and customary\ntenants. Searle has suggested that where opposition did occur in Cumbria it was usually\nover local, specific issues rather than the general desirability of enclosure.\nThe evidence for Westmorland bears this out though instances of opposition do occur.\nThe House of Commons Journal records a number of counter petitions against enclosure\nbills. A notable case was in the parish of Ravenstonedale in 1767 when ninety one\npeople, customary tenants and small freeholders, signed a petition opposing an attempt\nby Sir James Lowther, the lord of the manor, to enclose the commons.48 Elsewhere\nopposition was a small minority. At Cliburn in 1803, twenty four landowners were for\nthe bill, seven against. The average rental valuation of the property in the township of\nthose supporting enclosure was \u00a37.58 and for those against only \u00a34.82 indicating that\nopposition came mainly from smaller landowners.49 At Reagill in 1802, seventeen\nParliamentary Enclosure in Westmorland 29\nlandowners were for the bill, two against and three were deemed incapable (one was in\nthe West Indies, one an idiot and a third simply could not be traced) but here one of the\nopponents was a more substantial landowner who was against the bill as being \u2018contrary\nto the interest\u2019 of the township.50 At Dufton in 1822 out of forty nine owners none were\nagainst enclosure and only four were neutral.51 At Yanwath near Penrith in 1812 the\nQuaker Thomas Wilkinson produced an anti-enclosure pamphlet arguing that the 150\nacres common of Yanwath Moor was not worth the expense of enclosing but he was not\nsupported by the rest of the customary tenants.52\nSome opposition was more effective. At Asby in 1806\u20137 those opposed to the bill to\nenclose the commons of Asby Coatsworth manor \u2013 at least thirteen of them \u2013 mounted a\ncampaign in London to persuade absentee landowners to sign a petition opposing the\nbill which was presented to the House of Commons in 20th April 1807 by the MP,\nColonel Lowther. For whatever reason, however, the bill was dropped. Another bill was\npresented to Parliament in 1813. Notwithstanding that the lord of the manor agreed to\naccept only a 40th share of the land to facilitate enclosure no act was passed for this\nmanor until 1845, although the reasons for the opposition are not clear.53 In 1824\nWilliam Wordsworth successfully spoke out in defence of the rights of the statesmen\nfarmers and against the proposals of agents of Lady de Fleming who planned to enclose\nthe Rydal commons.54\nThe process of enclosure\nFor most late eighteenth-century enclosures it was normal to appoint three commis-\nsioners. From the first decade of the nineteenth century two commissioners became\nnormal and after the general act of 1845 it was normal to have only one \u2018valuer\u2019. The\nmen who were chosen as enclosure commissioners in Westmorland were, as elsewhere,\npredominantly local (Table 3). Where their status was recorded over half were styled\n\u2018gentleman\u2019 and a further 6 per cent \u2018esquire\u2019. Others were estate stewards and land\nagents (a category which was dropped after new standing orders for Parliament in 1801\nbecause of potential partiality), land surveyors, clergymen and lawyers. Most of them\nwere only involved in one or two awards, though some may of course have acted in other\ncounties. Most of them were only involved in one (59 per cent) or two (21 per cent)\nawards but 3 per cent each dealt with 6 and 7; 1 per cent with 9; and 1 per cent with 20\nawards. The most active, as mentioned above, were Thomas Heelis and Crayston\nWebster. Webster, as sole valuer for twenty one enclosures made under the 1845 act,\noversaw the re-shaping of nearly a fifth of the total area enclosed in Westmorland.\nLittle information is available regarding the reasons behind the choice of commis-\nsioners. At Shap in 1805 new commissioners were chosen by a majority (by value) of the\nproprietors but at Bolton in 1803 the lord of the manor, Sir Frederick Vane, was recorded\nas having said that he expected to have the right to nominate one commissioner, aswas then\ncustomary.55 On the other hand, at Reagill in 1802 Thomas Harrison was proposed as\n\u2018commissioner for the tenants\u2019.56 John Beatham was dropped as a possible commissioner\nfor Reagill as he had an interest in the adjoining townships of Sleagill and Newby, the\nboundaries of whose commons with Reagill were then in dispute.57\n30 Ian Whyte\nSimilarly little information is available on how claims to common rights were judged\nby the commissioners. However, it is clear that customary tenants, even very small ones,\nwere given as much consideration as freeholders. What is less clear is how landless\ncottagers fared although this class was not numerous in Westmorland. As elsewhere,\nsquatters who had been in occupation for less that twenty years were not usually allowed\nthe right to an allotment.\nThe process of parliamentary enclosure was expensive but it is di\u0081cult to provide\nmeaningful details of just how much money was involved, either in total or per acre.\nThere were two major elements in the cost \u2013 items concerned with the o\u0081cial enclosure\nprocedure and the cost of improving individual allotments, mainly incurred after the\naward was made. Where costs are given in general works as a figure per acre it is rarely\nclear whether both elements are involved. In the earlier part of the period in particular\nmany of the up-front costs of getting an enclosure bill approved and then an act of\nParliament passed were met by loans from the major proprietors. In the longer term\ncosts could be met by a proportional levy on all those receiving allotments. Alterna-\ntively, money could be raised by selling off plots to the highest bidders. This was done in\nroughly half the awards in Westmorland, a figure similar to that for Cumberland.58 The\nproportion of the land auctioned in this way was often around 10 per cent but ranged\nfrom as low as 4 per cent to over 50 per cent depending on the quality of the land\ninvolved. Estimates of costs, as indicated by the amount of land sold off, were not always\naccurate. At Dufton, where relatively little land was sold off due in part to a dispute over\nthe right to cut turf on the area concerned, a second proportional levy had to be imposed\non those entitled to allotments.59\nAssuming that most commissioners made a reasonable forecast of costs, income from\nsales of land per acre enclosed could vary widely, even at the same period. There was no\nmarked trend for public costs, measured in this way, to rise over time. This can be\nParliamentary Enclosure in Westmorland 31\nTable 3\nGeographical origins of Westmorland enclosure commissioners\nWestmorland 56%\nCumberland 30\nYorkshire 8\nLancashire 1.5\nDurham 1.5\nNorfolk 1.5\nLondon 1.5\nSocial origins of Westmorland enclosure commissioners\nGentlemen 55%\nEsquire 6\nEstate Stewards and Land Agents 17\nLand Surveyors 6\nClergymen 8\nLawyers 4\nMiscellanous 4\nexplained in part by the general enclosure acts of 1836 and 1845 streamlining the process\nand reducing costs. On the other hand there was a clear relationship between the cost of\nenclosure per acre and the number of years intervening between the dates of the act and\naward. As lengthy enclosure processes tended to be concentrated during the Napoleonic\nwars, costs then were often higher than later in the nineteenth century. Among the\npublic costs some expenses, such as making the roads, were relatively fixed but where an\naward dragged on other expenses such as legal fees and payments to commissioners\ncould rise sharply. The amount of money raised from the sale of land sometimes proved\ninsu\u0081cient to cover the final costs, necessitating an additional levy on those awarded\nallotments. Less commonly too much money was raised and repayments had to be\nmade.60\nAn allotment first had to be surrounded by some kind of stockproof barrier. Drystone\nwalls seem to have cost around 4s. 4d. per rood (7 yards) to construct but this did not\ninclude the cost of carrying the stone. Hedging plants were obtainable at around 15\nshillings per 1,000 but the cost of planting them was extra, as was the provision of\nprotective post and rail fencing, plus the additional cost of replacing any hawthorn\nplants that did not survive.61 Although a few hedging and fencing accounts have\nsurvived much of the work is likely to have been undertaken by family labour. Overall,\ndrystone walling seems to have been more convenient, providing a stockproof barrier as\nsoon as it was completed, unlike a hedge which might need to grow for several years in\norder to achieve this.\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars the cost of improving an allotment so that it could be\ncultivated, excluding the actual fencing, was rarely less than two to three pounds per\nacre and could be as much as seven pounds or more. Liming alone might involve 100\u2013\n160 loads per acre at a shilling per load \u2013 between five and eight pounds. Paring and\nburning the surface vegetation and turf could cost an additional 16 shillings per acre.62\nEnclosure was, theoretically, expensive but the profits, in particular when conversion to\narable was involved, allowed costs to be recovered within two or three years. Addition-\nally, in a county characterised by small family farms, much of the labour probably came\nfrom family members and living-in farm servants and so was not costed directly.\nProblems with enclosure\nA notable feature of parliamentary enclosure in Westmorland was the lengthy period\nintervening between the passage of the act and completion of the award in many\nprocesses compared with lowland England where relatively few enclosures took more\nthan four or five years to accomplish. Chapman has suggested that in Wales, where\nparliamentary enclosure was also predominantly of upland waste, a much higher\nproportion of acts took a long time to complete compared with lowland England due\nto the inexperience of the commissioners involved.63 In Westmorland 54 per cent of\nenclosures took five years or more to complete and 25 per cent ten years or more (Table\n4). Some of this may have been due to the large amount of land involved and the high\nnumbers of claimants but the correlation between the time taken and the area enclosed,\nwhile positive, is not a strong one suggesting that other factors were involved.\n32 Ian Whyte\nEighty-nine per cent of late-eighteenth-century enclosures were completed quickly,\nan exception being Orton (see below). It may be that these cases were simply not\ncontentions ones, especially as most of them involved relatively small areas and limited\nnumbers of people. During the war years and the 1820s 65 per cent of enclosures took\nover five years to complete. From the 1830s onwards the figure was much lower, 38 per\ncent. It is likely that the provisions of the 1845 general act allowed enclosure to proceed\nfaster and more smoothly while the high agricultural prices which prevailed during the\nwar years may have made enclosures at this time more contentious. It is also possible\nthat the post 1815 slump in prices may have delayed some awards due to allotment\nholders having more di\u0081culty in raising funds to meet the costs of enclosure. This is\nsuggested by the fact that the average period from act to award for enclosures started\nand completed between 1800 and 1815 was 6.0 years but for those started before 1815\nand completed after, the figure was 9.9 years. However, over a broader time span, lack of\ncapital does not seem to have been a major cause of delay. There was little difference\nbetween the pattern of time taken for all enclosures and those where land was sold to\ncover costs (Table 3).\nOn the other hand, enclosure activity in Westmorland during the 1770s and after 1845\nwas dominated by two highly professional commissioners: Thomas Heelis, land agent to\nthe earl of Thanet in the earlier period and Crayston Webster, a land surveyor in\nKendal, in the later one. None of Heelis\u2019 nine awards and only three out of Webster\u2019s\ntwenty one took more than five years to complete. This may indeed imply that a lack of\nexperience by commissioners slowed down progress in other cases. The causes of delays\nare not always possible to identify where only the award has survived or even where\nsupplementary documentation, including minute books, accounts and correspondence,\nexists.\nOne factor which could delay an enclosure was the death of one or more commis-\nsioners. The cases of Reagill and Shap, where all the commissioners died without\nappointing successors and new acts had to be secured, have already been mentioned.\nThe same happened with Sleagill. One or two cases of commissioners resigning\nand being replaced also occur such as Robert Lumb of Lowther who resigned from\ntwo sets of enclosure proceedings, Casterton and Scalthwaiterigg, in 1812. At Warcop,\nParliamentary Enclosure in Westmorland 33\nTable 4\nPeriod of time between act and award\nProportion of acts and awards\nEnclosures where\nPeriod of time All enclosures land was sold\nUnder 5 years 46% 45\n6\u20139 29 26\n10\u201314 16 16\n15\u201319 4 10\n20\u0087 6 3\nTotal 100% 100\nproceedings were held up by the commissioner decamping to Potosi in South America.\nThe problem of lack of experience on the part of commissioners is di\u0081cult to isolate.\nThe Reverend Edward Jackson, vicar of Bolton, who was commissioner for the\nenclosure of Dufton from 1827, confessed himself to be di\u0081dent and unsure of his\nabilities,64 but cases of incompetence are hard to spot. A study of the parliamentary\nenclosure of Saddleworth in the Pennines, where the act was passed in 1810 and the\naward only made in 1834, indicated that delays were due to a variety of factors including\nthe complex nature of the claims to rights on the common due to the earlier history of\nenclosure in this area, the time taken to deal with the many encroachments which had\nbeen made on the moor, delays due to problems in defining the boundary of the\ncommon, the slowness of the surveyors, commitments elsewhere which resulted in\nthe commissioner rarely being in attendance at certain periods and finally the death of\nthe commissioner.65 The surviving documentation for this enclosure is more detailed\nthan for any of the parliamentary enclosure processes in Westmorland. As a result it\nprovides insights into the kinds of di\u0081culties which may have arisen further north.\nA practical di\u0081culty in the later eighteenth century was the relatively poor quality of\nsome early enclosure surveys and award maps. The first upland area with relatively\ndi\u0081cult terrain to be surveyed was Orton in the 1770s. Here the poor quality of the\nmaps and the cumbersome system for distinguishing allotments may have added to the\ndi\u0081culties experienced in this enclosure. Elsewhere, however, other enclosures from\nthis period were of relatively small lowland commons which were easier to survey. By\nthe opening of the nineteenth century the quality of surveying had improved signifi-\ncantly to a level at which it was fully able to cope with the rougher topography involved.\nBoundary disputes were a common problem. Disagreements over the boundaries of\ntownships and manors in north west England continued, in some cases, to the end of the\nnineteenth century.66 The fact that intercommoning between manors or townships, with\ncomplex sets of customary rights, continued as late as this helps to account for the problem.\nFrom 1801 enclosure commissioners had the power, where the boundaries of a common\nwere uncertain, to examine witnesses, weigh up the evidence and make a ruling. In the\nevent of this being disputed, cases could be referred to the local Quarter Sessions.\nIn the case of a disputed boundary between the commons of Reagill and Sleagill in\n1803, eyewitness evidence given to the commissioners extended back to the 1730s while\ndocumentary evidence from the seventeenth century was also cited.67 This was all to no\navail, for agreement could not be reached and the case went to the Quarter Sessions at\nAppleby. There do not seem to have been any major boundary disputes associated with\nthe late eighteenth-century enclosures. The fact that most of the commons were\nrelatively small and probably intensively-used areas of lowland pasture, whose bound-\naries should have been well known, may help to account for this. From 1801 until 1806,\nwhich is as far as the Westmorland Quarter Sessions rolls have been indexed, a number\nof cases of boundary disputes prompted by enclosure arose. Such disputes are not\nnecessarily evident from the enclosure awards and are more likely to emerge where other\nsupplementary papers have survived. In other cases the existence of ruler-straight\nboundaries dividing the commons of adjoining townships indicates readjustment by\nenclosure commissioners.\n34 Ian Whyte\nA well-recorded boundary dispute arose in 1814 concerning the townships of Preston\nPatrick and Lupton east of Kendal.68 Evidently it was the perambulation of the\nboundary by the commissioners that set off the dispute though the depositions of\nwitnesses suggest that there had been friction in the past over grazing and cutting turves.\nThe issue was not a straightforward one because witnesses revealed cases where farmers\nwith holdings in Preston Patrick had, at various times, owned or leased land in Lupton,\ngiving them rights to the use of both commons. A surviving sketch survey shows that the\nboundary was disputed over a considerable length but not a great width. The\ntopography of the area encouraged confusion; the line of the watershed was far from\nclear due to several low hills and marshy saddles. The case went to the Quarter Sessions\nin Appleby and seems to have been resolved by 1818.\nThe enclosure of Orton\nA complicated dispute arose in connection with the enclosure of Orton. The circum-\nstances were unique and it is hard to judge to what extent inexperience, cupidity or a\ncombination of the two were to blame for the dificulties. Orton and Raisbeck were\nseparate manors within the parish of Orton. The customary tenants of each manor had\nbought the manorial rights in the early seventeenth century. Following this separate\nmanorial courts continued to be held to prevent encroachments and to regulate the\ncommons. At some time in the early eighteenth century the two courts were amalga-\nmated in order to save money and were held jointly at Orton. In the mid to late\neighteenth century the inhabitants of Orton allowed the encroachment of a number of\ncottages on parts of their common adjoining Raisbeck and a considerable amount of peat\ncutting also reduced the value of the common. The Raisbeck commons, twice the size of\nthe ones in Orton and of comparable quality, were also starting to come under pressure.\nWhen support for an enclosure bill was being canvassed most of the inhabitants of\nOrton were in favour and most in Raisbeck against. Of the three commissioners\nappointed in 1769 to undertake the Orton enclosure one already held land in Orton\nand another bought land there after the act was passed. Two of the three commissioners\nthus had a direct interest in the proceedings, an unusual and undesirable situation. The\n1769 act made no mention of the manor of Raisbeck but in 1773, when the commis-\nsioners started work in earnest, it was soon realised that they were setting out allotments\non Raisbeck common as well as Orton. The inhabitants of Raisbeck protested to the\ncommissioners and took legal advice. As a result of the upset this caused, the commis-\nsioners seem to have done nothing for five years. In 1779 an award was made which\nincluded allotments on Raisbeck common. The advice of legal counsel was that Raisgill\ndid not have a case because, first, they had allowed joint meetings of their manor court\nwith Orton over a long period of time and earlier records of a separate court at Raisbeck\nhad not survived. Second, the inhabitants of Raisbeck had acquiesced in this and,\ncrucially, no protest had been made by any of the Raisbeck landowners when the\ncommissioners had made a perambulation of the boundaries of the area to be enclosed,\nincluding their common, and public warning of the date of the meeting had been given.\nThe inhabitants of Raisbeck were nevertheless still resisting the process of enclosure in\nParliamentary Enclosure in Westmorland 35\n1782, three years after the award had been made. They were convinced that the\ncommissioners were biased and that the whole affair was a ploy by the people of\nOrton to get a share of the Raisbeck commons; they may well have been right.69\nRelations between Orton and Raisbeck were further complicated by a dispute over the\nboundary between the two commons. The problems are detailed in a document which is\nundated but which, by comparison of the people named, was written at around the time\nof the enclosure proceedings. As well as a disagreement over the line of the boundary\nthere were differences of opinion over who had a right to graze livestock, cut turf and\npull ling on Raisbeck common. Some inhabitants of Orton seem to have acquired small\namounts of land in Raisbeck manor as a way of trying to gain access to the larger\nRaisbeck commons. Not surprisingly, the people of Raisbeck objected.70\nConclusion\nMuch research on parliamentary enclosure has been undertaken either at a broad\ngeneralised level or as detailed local case studies. By adopting an intermediate scale of\nfocus, the timing and distribution of parliamentary enclosure in the most upland of\nEnglish counties have been established, and have been related to a range of environ-\nmental, economic and social variables. In the process it has been shown that the\nparliamentary enclosure of upland waste was more complex than has sometimes been\nsupposed. Compared with many lowland areas, parliamentary enclosure started slowly\nbut was more protracted, continuing into the later nineteenth century, due largely to the\npastoral nature of the country and the poor quality of much of the land. The earliest\nphase of enclosure, in the Eden valley during the 1770s, was occasioned by the\nexpansion of cultivation on relatively good soils as well as by the pressures on common\npastures created by the droving trade. The enclosure of marginal land for cultivation\nwas also a feature of the Napoleonic War era while enclosure in the mid nineteenth\ncentury was largely linked to the improvement of pasture. The advantages of enclosure\nwere varied; some, such as the sale of plots for villa construction, were specific to\nparticular localities while others, such as the development of the earl of Lonsdale\u2019s\nallotments on Shap, were related to patterns of land ownership.\nAlthough opposition to enclosure was not widespread in Westmorland, the process of\nenclosure sometimes brought to a head long-standing disputes between communities,\nparticularly over boundaries between adjoining commons. In some cases such disputes\nwere lengthy and complex, causing a significant delay in the implementation of\nenclosure. In a significant proportion of cases, particularly during the Napoleonic\nWars, the completion of enclosure awards was delayed for reasons which are not always\nclear but which may have included a lack of experience on the part of commissioners.\nDisputes over boundaries, disagreements over claims and delays due to the deaths of\ncommissioners can be discerned from the awards and especially from other enclosure\npapers, but these only survive for a few enclosure processes.\nSpace has not permitted an examination of the new landscapes that were created by\nthe enclosure commissioners, while research on the impact of enclosure on the notably\ntraditional and conservative rural society of Westmorland, particularly in relation to\n36 Ian Whyte\npopulation change and the poor rates, is in progress but it is hoped that something of the\ncomplexity of the processes of enclosure in this rugged yet varied area has been conveyed.\nAcknowledgements\nThe author would like to record his thanks to Chris Beacock for producing the maps, to\nthe anonymous referees for their helpful comments, and to the staff of the Kendal\nRecord O\u0081ce for their help and patience.\nNotes\n1.
