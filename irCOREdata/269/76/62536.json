Once thought to be\nsomething rarely encountered in the wild (Comfort 1979),\nthere is now convincing evidence that senescence is a wide-\nspread and fundamental phenomenon in natural popu-\nlations (Keller and Genoud 1997; Ricklefs 1998; Berube et\nal. 1999; Ericsson et al. 2001; Bonduriansky and Brassil\n2002; Reznick et al. 2004). The majority of investigations\nto date have focused on documenting and describing in-\ncreases in mortality in old age, known as actuarial senes-\ncence, with an emphasis on the need to explain interspe-\ncific variation in incidence and rates of actuarial senescence\n(Promislow 1991; Holmes and Austad 1995; Ricklefs 2000;\nRicklefs and Scheuerlein 2001). In contrast, investigating\nwhether reproductive performance declines with age has\nproved more difficult, and empirical studies are rare. Anal-\nyses of senescence (both actuarial and reproductive) are\nproblematic because of the inherent problems involved in\nobtaining large enough samples of the oldest cohorts and\nin following individuals of known age (which must be\nmarked at birth or at recognizable ages) throughout their\nentire life spans. In addition, differential mortality rates\nof phenotypes associated with variation in individual qual-\nity may either obscure or falsely amplify reproductive se-\nnescence effects at the population level (Forslund and Pa\u00a8rt\n1995; Nisbet 2001). Recent methodological and analytical\nadvances, however, in combination with accumulating\ndata from more and more long-term studies on marked\nindividuals, are making the reliable detection and report-\nE90 The American Naturalist\ning of age-related declines in performance parameters at\nthe individual level increasingly possible (Reid et al. 2003;\nCatry et al. 2006; Crespin et al. 2006; Nussey et al. 2006;\nvan de Pol and Verhulst 2006).\nSenescence entails a loss in fitness to the organism; its\nwidespread occurrence is therefore challenging to explain\nfrom an evolutionary perspective, and several theories have\nbeen advanced. Evolutionary theories of senescence are\nbased on the premise that the strength of natural selection\ndeclines with age, as dictated by levels of extrinsic mortality\n(Medawar 1952; Hamilton 1966; Charlesworth 1980; Par-\ntridge and Barton 1993). In the mutation accumulation\ntheory for the evolution of aging, harmful mutations with\nlate-acting effects amass in older age classes as a result of\nreduced effective population size and the consequent rel-\native inefficiency of selection at purging mutations effected\nat these later stages (Medawar 1952). Similarly, the theory\nof antagonistic pleiotropy postulates that genotypes that\nincrease early-life fecundity or fitness at the expense of\nlater-life fitness (via the action of pleiotropic genes or link-\nage disequilibrium) can be selected for if selection is much\nstronger earlier in the life history, so that early benefits\noutweigh later costs (Williams 1957). Related to antago-\nnistic pleiotropy is the concept of the disposable soma,\nwhich proposes that senescence is the outcome of a balance\nof trade-offs between increased investment in early repro-\nduction at the expense of future survival and future re-\nproduction, and particularly at the expense of somatic\nmaintenance, which would favor increased survival and\nlongevity (Kirkwood 1977; Kirkwood and Rose 1991).\nCentral to the theories of antagonistic pleiotropy and\ndisposable soma is the notion that reproduction is costly\n(Williams 1966). In natural situations, organisms are usu-\nally limited in their abilities to acquire and utilize resources\n(energy and nutrients). Resources invested in reproduc-\ntion, which is energetically highly expensive, are not then\navailable for allocation to other functions such as growth,\ncellular repair, and immune function (Nur 1984; Reznick\n1985; Gustafsson and Sutherland 1988; Gustafsson et al.\n1994; Hanssen et al. 2003). Individuals investing heavily\nin reproduction at early stages are thus more likely to\nexhibit increased senescence and\/or reduced longevity.\nSuch energetic trade-offs provide a physiological frame-\nwork through which the action of genes with antagonistic\nearly- versus late-life fitness effects could be mediated (Par-\ntridge 1987). Antagonistic pleiotropy and disposable soma\ntherefore both make similar predictions, namely, that in-\ncreases in reproductive investment early in life should be\naccompanied by reductions in late-life performance and\/\nor survival. Empirical evidence for the existence of such\ntrade-offs in natural populations is, however, sparse, and\nsupport for both theories derives mainly from laboratory\nstudies on insects (Rose and Charlesworth 1980; Partridge\nand Barton 1993; Service 1993). Little research has been\ncarried out on intraspecific variation in rates of senescence\nrelated to costs of reproduction in natural populations,\nand very few studies have provided clear evidence of a\nlink between the two (Gustafsson and Pa\u00a8rt 1990; Reid et\nal. 2003; Nussey et al. 2006). Moreover, costs are likely to\nvary depending on prevailing environmental conditions,\nand it is therefore plausible that different experiences of\nearly-life environmental conditions may generate variation\nin senescence rates. Importantly, investigations of senes-\ncence require appropriate ecological contexts, a fact that\nis difficult to address in laboratory studies.\nBirds, for their body size, live remarkably long compared\nto mammals and in general are expected to senesce at\nslower rates (Williams 1957; Holmes and Austad 1995;\nRicklefs and Scheuerlein 2001). Compelling evidence for\nreproductive senescence, in particular, has been difficult\nto obtain (Coulson and Fairweather 2001; Catry et al.\n2006). Seabirds are among the longest-lived of all birds\nand constitute excellent models for research into both the\nevolutionary ecology and physiological basis of aging\n(Holmes et al. 2001; Ricklefs 1998; Monaghan and Hauss-\nmann 2006). In this article we examine rates of repro-\nductive senescence in a population of common guillemots\n(Uria aalge) breeding on the Isle of May in Scotland. The\nguillemot is a long-lived, colonial, sexually monomorphic\nseabird. Individuals form multiyear pair bonds, and fe-\nmales lay a single egg clutch. Previous work on this pop-\nulation showed both actuarial and reproductive senes-\ncence, with reduced average survival prospects and average\nbreeding success apparent in the older age classes (Crespin\net al. 2006). In this earlier study, time elapsed since first\ncapture (TFC) was used as a proxy for age, since birds in\nthe population are largely marked as breeding adults of\nunknown age. Simulation models showed that TFC could\nbe used as a reliable surrogate measure for age, and em-\nploying TFC in models using data from known individuals\ndid not introduce any biases or significantly reduce the\nprobability of being able to detect senescence (Crespin et\nal. 2006). This approach, however, cannot fully discount\nthe possibility of covariation between probability of sur-\nvival (and therefore longevity) and individual quality,\nwhich would result in progressive changes in the pheno-\ntypic composition of older age classes (van de Pol and\nVerhulst 2006). For example, if poor reproducers die youn-\nger, they will progressively disappear from the population\nsuch that the oldest cohorts will always contain a higher\nproportion of good-quality individuals (the selective-\ndisappearance hypothesis; Forslund and Pa\u00a8rt 1995; Cam\nand Monnat 2000; Reid et al. 2003; van de Pol and Verhulst\n2006). This would have the effect of increasing average\nbreeding success in the oldest age classes, thus decreasing\nReproductive Senescence in a Long-Lived Seabird E91\nthe probability of detecting reproductive senescence\nthrough a consideration of age.\nHere we utilize a novel technique to describe and quan-\ntify the extent of reproductive senescence in individual\ncommon guillemots. The approach relies on considering\nthe relationship between breeding success and years before\ndeath (YBD) as a means of detecting senescence, where\nsenescence is defined as a progressive reduction in breed-\ning performance in the years leading up to the death of\nan individual. The use of YBD as an alternative to age or\nage proxies has two main advantages, since it (1) allows\nfor the reliable detection of within-individual senescent\ndeclines in breeding success in individuals whose exact age\nis unknown and (2) avoids the problems of selective dis-\nappearance because, by definition, all individuals even-\ntually disappear from the sample in question. Our first\nobjectives were to quantify within-individual senescent de-\nclines in breeding success, to determine at what stage of\nthe life span senescence effects become important, and to\nestablish whether rates of senescence differ between the\nsexes in guillemots. For example, sex differences in mor-\ntality regimes, if present, could lead to the sex with higher\nmortality also exhibiting more rapid senescence (Williams\n1957). To the best of our knowledge, no study has spe-\ncifically tested for sex differences in reproductive senes-\ncence rates before, despite the clear prediction made by\nWilliams\u2019s theory. Second, we explored the extent to which\nearly-life reproduction and the environmental conditions\nexperienced early in life influence individual rates of se-\nnescence. Third, we aimed to identify whether longevity\n(reproductive life span) is also affected by early-life re-\nproductive effort, and finally, we quantified the impact of\nsenescence on lifetime reproductive success.\nMaterial and Methods\nStudy Population and Data Collection\nWe studied common guillemots (Uria aalge) breeding on\nthe Isle of May, Firth of Forth, Scotland (56\u000211\u0001N, 2\u000233\u0001W)\neach year from 1982 to 2004. Individual breeding guille-\nmots of unknown age were marked with unique metal and\ncolored rings. Ringing commenced in 1982, and each sub-\nsequent year, additional breeding adults were caught and\nringed in an effort to increase numbers of individually\nidentifiable birds and to replace marked birds that had\ndisappeared from the population, thereby sustaining com-\nprehensive sampling in the study areas. Searches for these\nbirds were carried out on an almost daily basis during the\nbreeding season to determine survival, whether a breeding\nsite was held, laying date relative to when birds in the same\narea laid (relative laying date; Reed et al. 2006), and breed-\ning success, that is, whether they reared a chick that left\nthe colony at the normal age (for further details on study\npopulation and methods, see Harris and Wanless 1988).\nThe analysis was based on 115 females and 123 males.\nVariables Used in Analyses\nThe following variables were used in analyses to test our\nmain hypothesis that rates of within-individual decline in\nreproductive performance may be associated with early-\nlife reproduction and with environmental conditions ex-\nperienced early in life.\nMeasures of Reproductive Performance. Guillemots have a\nsingle egg clutch and can raise a maximum of one chick\nper year. Breeding success in a given year was therefore\ndefined as a binary response variable, with 1 indicating\nsuccessful (i.e., raised a chick to the age at which it would\nleave the colony; chicks are taken to sea by the male parent\nafter \u223c3 weeks and are still flightless) and 0 indicating\nfailure (i.e., did not raise a chick to leaving the colony that\nyear, regardless of whether the individual actually bred or\neven held a site). This measure took account of the 5%\u2013\n10% of birds observed alive in the study colonies that do\nnot breed (lay an egg) in any year (Harris and Wanless\n1995), primarily because of eviction from breeding sites\nby other guillemots, although some birds (\u223c1%) occupy\nsites but do not produce an egg (Harris and Wanless 1995;\nKokko et al. 2004). Because competition for available sites\nwas fierce, we predicted that if birds lose their competitive\nedge in old age, there will be a higher incidence of site\nloss and\/or nonbreeding in the years leading up to death\nof individuals. For this reason, we also consider (1) the\nprobability of individuals attempting to breed and (2) the\nprobability of individuals holding a site in relation to years\nbefore death (YBD). We also tested whether the probability\nof changing site increased in the years leading up to the\ndeath of birds.\nYears before Death. We quantified senescence from the\nrelationship between breeding success and YBD as an al-\nternative measure to age. When a bird disappeared from\nthe study population and did not return in subsequent\nyears, it was presumed to be dead. However, resighting\nprobabilities, although very high (98%), decline in old age,\nprobably because older individuals come back to the col-\nony to breed less regularly than younger birds (Crespin et\nal. 2006), so the possibility that birds had changed colonies\nor were simply not detected within the study plots could\nnot be excluded, although this was considered unlikely.\nBreeding success of all individuals was considered in re-\nlation to YBD, with 1 denoting the final year of life before\ndisappearance. Initial analysis (plotting breeding success\nagainst YBD) suggested that declines in breeding success\nE92 The American Naturalist\nFigure 1: Relationship between years before death and breeding success\n(the proportion of occasions where a chick was successfully raised to\ndepart the colony).

Reproductive life span (RLS) was\nthe number of years from marking until disappearance\n(death). Since exact age of ringed birds was not known,\nwe cannot know the true RLS. Birds were marked in five\nareas on the island; in four of these, the majority of birds\nwere caught in the first 1 or 2 years of the study and are\ntherefore likely to be a representative sample of ages in\nthe population. Ringing effort was then focused on new\nbirds as they entered the breeding population (these re-\ncruits can be assumed to be a minimum age of 6 years,\nthe average age at first breeding in this population; Harris\net al. 1994). The analyses were repeated excluding the birds\nmarked at the beginning of the study and in the one area\nwhere only a minority of the population was ringed. None\nof the conclusions changed, so we report the results using\nthe full data set of 115 females and 123 males. The average\nlength of the RLS (for birds included in the analyses) was\n15 years (range 8\u201324 years).\nOur analysis of senescence presumes that all individuals\ndie of old age. In reality, some individuals will not reach\nthe age at which senescence effects become apparent but\nwill die from accidents or disease much earlier. Therefore\nwe also examined declines in breeding success in the last\n3 years of life, relative to earlier breeding success, in re-\nlation to RLS. An initial analysis found no difference in\naverage breeding success between the last 3 years of life\nand the presenescent years (fig. 2) for individuals that were\npresent for !8 years. In contrast, there were marked dif-\nferences in average breeding success between the last 3\nyears of life and the presenescent years for individuals with\nan RLS of \u22658 years (statistics provided in fig. 2 legend).\nThe shorter-lived group may have contained birds that\neither died suddenly at a young age, for whatever reason,\nor were of low quality and never survived to reach se-\nnescent ages. Furthermore, they may already have been\nold when marked, and in this case, the number of years\nwe recorded these individuals as having been alive would\nnot have been a reliable approximation of RLS. We there-\nfore take a conservative approach and restrict subsequent\nanalyses to birds present for \u22658 years.\nEarly-Life Reproductive Output. An index of early-life re-\nproductive output was obtained by totaling the number\nof chicks that an individual raised during the first half of\nits time at the colony and dividing by the number of years\nReproductive Senescence in a Long-Lived Seabird E93\nFigure 3: Temporal trends in average breeding success in the colony\nacross the study period. There are two distinct periods, as indicated by\nthe dashed dividing line: 1982\u20131996, where productivity remained rel-\natively stable, and 1997\u20132004, where productivity declined sharply.\nin this period, thus giving mean annual breeding success\nin an individual\u2019s early life. We then tested to see how this\nmeasure of early-life effort was associated with individual\nrates of senescence.\nEnvironmental Conditions Experienced Early in Life. We\ntested the hypothesis that the environment experienced by\nindividuals early in life may also affect the rate at which\nthey senesce in later life, if the magnitude of costs incurred\nthrough early reproduction depends on prevailing envi-\nronmental conditions. We used two different summary\nmeasures of environmental quality to quantify early con-\nditions: (1) a direct measure of climatic conditions, the\nwinter North Atlantic Oscillation index (NAO), and (2)\nmean annual breeding success in the colony as whole. The\nNAO is a well-known climate measure based on deviations\nfrom long -term average pressure differences in the north-\nern Atlantic. The winter index (wNAO) strongly predicts\nlarge-scale climatic conditions and weather patterns in\nnorthwestern Europe (Hurrell 1995): positive wNAO val-\nues indicate warm, wet winters dominated by westerly\nwinds, and negative values indicate the opposite. The NAO\nis frequently used in ecological studies across a range of\nspecies as an environmental correlate of biological traits\n(Stenseth et al. 2003). In this population, wNAO is cor-\nrelated with breeding time, an important fitness deter-\nminant; breeding is earlier in strongly positive NAO years\nwhen conditions are generally more favorable (Frederiksen\net al. 2004; Reed et al. 2006). For each individual, wNAO\nvalues were averaged across the first half of its time at the\ncolony to give a single index of weather conditions ex-\nperienced early in life for each bird in the analysis (here-\nafter termed \u201cearly-life NAO\u201d). The second measure, mean\nbreeding success in the whole colony each year, was ob-\ntained from a much larger sample of marked breeding\nsites ( ; includes sites of both marked individualsnp 1,412\nand nonmarked individuals) that were also followed\nthroughout the study, thereby giving a measure of annual\nmean breeding success with high resolution. In years where\ngeneral conditions, such as food availability, weather, avail-\nability of good-quality breeding sites, and so on, are poor,\nthis will be reflected in reduced overall breeding success\nat the colony level (Aebischer et al. 1990). In contrast,\nyears of high breeding success represent situations where\nconditions were favorable, for example, where food was\nrelatively abundant and easily available. For each individ-\nual, annual mean values of colony breeding success were\naveraged across the first half of the individual\u2019s time at\nthe colony to give a single index of general conditions\nexperienced early in life for each bird in the analysis (here-\nafter referred to as \u201cearly-life colony success\u201d). Although\nboth wNAO and mean colony success were correlated with\nmean laying date in the colony, they were not correlated\nwith each other ( for years), and so theyrp 0.24 np 23\nencapsulate different aspects of overall environmental con-\nditions. We predicted that if individuals experienced on\naverage poor conditions early in life (negative or low\nwNAO index or low colony success), this would result in\nhigher costs of early reproduction and thus increased rates\nof senescence later in life.\nTemporal Changes in Breeding Success. Average breeding\nsuccess in the whole colony changed over time during the\nstudy, with two distinct periods: 1981\u20131996, when breed-\ning success remained relatively constant, and 1997\u20132004,\nwhen there was a marked decline in breeding success (fig.\n3). Such temporal trends in breeding success may com-\nplicate the detection of senescence if, for example, indi-\nviduals that reach senescence age toward the end of the\nstudy period also experience degraded environmental con-\nditions. Furthermore, this may generate false or inflated\nassociations between senescence rates and early-life en-\nvironment for these individuals. To account for this po-\ntentially confounding source of variation, we controlled\nfor the temporal changes by fitting a main effect of period\n(1981\u20131996 vs. 1997\u20132004) and a nested effect of year\nwithin period. Year was also included as a random effect\nin the mixed model, to further correct for temporal var-\niation in breeding success. (The mixed-model analysis was\nrepeated with and without the effects of period and year\nnested within period and also with year as a factor in the\nfixed model rather than the random model. These alter-\nnative ways of specifying the model did not significantly\nchange the results or conclusions, and hence all reported\neffects are robust to model restructuring.)\nE94 The American Naturalist\nStatistical Analyses\nTesting for Within-Individual Declines in Performance and\nFactors Associated with These Declines\nWithin-individual declines in breeding success in the years\nbefore death were tested for with a generalized linear\nmixed-effect model (GLMM), taking into account other\nimportant sources of variation that might have had an\neffect on breeding success. The model had breeding success\nas a binary response (successful or unsuccessful) and pe-\nriod (early\/late), year as a continuous variable nested\nwithin period (to reflect the differing temporal trends\nshown in fig. 3), senescence class, early-life reproductive\noutput, early-life NAO, early-life colony success, sex, and\nTFC as fixed effects. TFC was included to account for the\nfact that declines in breeding success may become apparent\nat different (estimated) ages. Period and sex were factors,\nwhile all other terms were continuous variables. Senescence\nclass (a summary version of YBD) was treated as a contin-\nuous variable in the model because we were interested in\nhow breeding success declines linearly in the years leading\nup to the death of individuals and how this decline (slope)\nmight vary between the sexes and among individuals. To\nanswer these latter questions, we fitted interaction terms\nbetween senescence class and sex, between senescence class\nand early-life reproductive output (to determine whether\nindividuals that invested varying amounts in reproduction\nearly in life senesced at different rates), and between se-\nnescence class and early-life environment (to test whether\nconditions experienced early in life, assessed by either\nwNAO or mean colony success, influenced the rate of se-\nnescence). Individual identity and year as factors were fitted\nas random effects to account for nonindependence of re-\npeated measures on individuals across years.

The significance of\nterms was assessed using Type III tests (as when added\nlast to the model, using Wald statistics compared against\na x2 distribution with the appropriate degrees of freedom),\nwith the significance of main effects assessed after first\ndropping associated interactions from the model. The\nGLMM had a logit-link function and a binomial error\nstructure (Crawley 2002).\nAs individuals get older, there is a tendency to breed\nlater in the season, and late laying is associated with re-\nduced breeding success (Wanless and Harris 1988). To\ncheck whether within-individual senescent declines in\nbreeding success later in life could simply be driven by\nolder birds breeding later, we repeated the GLMM with\nrelative laying date of individuals each year included as a\ncontinuous fixed effect.\nTesting for Declines in Probability of\nBreeding or Holding a Site\nThe significance of differences between senescence classes\nin the proportion of individuals attempting to breed and\nthe proportion of individuals holding sites was also as-\nsessed using a GLMM, with binary measures of perfor-\nmance (bred\/not bred, site held\/site not held) as the re-\nsponse variables in each case, senescence class as the only\n(continuous, ranging from \u00024 to \u00021) fixed effect, and\nrandom effects for individual identity and year in each. A\nGLMM was also similarly used to test whether the prob-\nability of individuals changing site (binary variable) in-\ncreased in the years approaching death.\nThe Effect of Early-Life Reproductive Output on\nRLS and Lifetime Breeding Success\nThe full mixed model tested for factors associated with\nindividual rates of decline in breeding success in the se-\nnescent years. We also assessed the extent to which these\nfactors influenced components of overall lifetime fitness,\nRLS and lifetime breeding success (LBS). To test for the\neffect of early-life reproductive output on RLS, for in-\nstance, whether individuals that invest heavily in repro-\nduction early in life also die earlier, we performed a re-\ngression analysis of RLS on early-life reproductive output\nand (early-life reproductive output)2. The quadratic term\nwas included to determine whether there was some op-\ntimum level of early investment in terms of future life\nspan. We then performed a multiple-regression analysis\nusing overall LBS as the response to determine the relative\nimportance for LBS of the various fitness components:\nearly-life reproductive output, (early-life reproductive out-\nput)2, output in senescent years, and RLS (Brown 1988).\nEach term was added sequentially in this order (the same\norder in which the events occur within an individual\u2019s life)\nas explanatory variables, and their significance was assessed\nusing Type I (i.e., sequential) tests. All models were fitted\nusing restricted maximum-likelihood (REML) and least-\nsquares methods in GENSTAT (8th ed.; VSN Interna-\ntional).\nReproductive Senescence in a Long-Lived Seabird E95\nTable 1: Results of final reduced mixed model (generalized linear mixed-effect model)\nshowing variables with significant effects on annual breeding success\nEffect Estimate SE df Wald statistic P value\nFixed effects:\nIntercept 1.204 .133\nPeriod:\n1981\u20131996 .000\n1997\u20132005 .351 .474 1 .55 .459\nPeriod\/year:\n1981\u20131996 .042 .064 2 5.50 .004\n1997\u20132005 \u0002.166 .064\nSex:\nFemales .000 1 2.97 .085\nMales .017 .100\nEarly-life reproductive output 3.476 .219 1 226.67 !.001\nEarly-life wNAO \u0002.001 .089 1 .19 .664\nSenescence class \u0002.221 .068 1 9.98 .002\nTFC .034 .017 1 4.20 .040\nSenescence class # sex:\nFemales .000 .082 1 3.99 .046\nMales .164 .082\nSenescence class # early-life\nreproductive output \u00021.376 .174 1 62.48 !.001\nSenescence class # early-life\nwNAO .186 .070 1 6.98 .008\nRandom effects:\nBird identity .177 .054\nYear (factor) .087 .045\nResidual variance .909 .023\nNote: Breeding success in a given year was scored as a binary response, with individualsnp 238\nbreeding in multiple years.

In addition, the proportion of\nindividuals attempting to breed was significantly lower in\nthe senescent years, with \u223c84% of individuals attempting\nto breed in the ultimate year of life compared to an average\nof \u223c93% in the presenescent years (effect of senescence\nclass in GLMM of bred\/not bred: ,Waldp 44.15 dfp\n, ).

Breeding success declined linearly with year\nin the latter period of the study, whereas there was no\neffect of year within the first period.

The effect was partic-\nularly marked in the ultimate year of life (mean breeding\nsuccess of males and females combined of 0.54, compared\nto an average of 0.74 in the presenescent years; fig. 4) but\nwas also significantly lower in the penultimate year of life\n(0.68) and somewhat lower in the third-to-last year (0.71).\nThere were no overall differences in breeding success be-\ntween males and females, but there was a significant in-\nteraction between sex and senescence class, indicating that\nfemales senesce at slightly faster rates than males (table 1;\nfig. 4). Females performed consistently worse than males\nin the last 3 years of life and particularly worse in the\nultimate year of life (fig. 4). Females also had lower aver-\nage early-life reproductive output than males (mean\n, mean ; two-tailed t-test:femalesp 0.724 malesp 0.765\n, ).tp \u00025.08 P ! .001\nFactors Influencing the Rate of Senescence\nIndividuals that performed well in the first half of their\nbreeding life span had significantly higher breeding success\non average throughout the full breeding life span. However,\nindividuals that had higher early-life reproductive output\nalso senesced faster, with a highly significant interaction\nbetween early-life output and senescence class in the final\nmodel (table 1). Figure 5A illustrates this trade-off, showing\nhow individuals that were highly successfully at raising\nchicks during the first half of their reproductive lives (high-\noutput individuals) had significantly lower breeding success\nin their senescent years compared to presenescent years. In\ncontrast, the difference in breeding success between senes-\ncent and presenescent years was not as pronounced for birds\nwith lower early-life reproductive output (i.e., those that\nwere less successful during early life).\nEarly environmental conditions also had a significant im-\npact on the rate of senescence. There was a highly significant\ninteraction between senescence class and early-life NAO:\nindividuals that experienced on average lower wNAO (i.e.,\npoorer climatic conditions) early in life senesced at faster\nrates (fig. 5B). Interactions between senescence class and\nearly-life NAO and senescence class and early-life colony\nsuccess were both included in the full model. Neither was\nsignificant when in the model together, and the interaction\nwith early-life colony success was less significant (effect of\nsenescence colony success in full model:class# early-life\n, , ,estimatep 4.344\u0003 3.666 Waldp 1.40 dfp 1 Pp\n). This interaction term and the main effect of early-.236\nlife colony success, which was also not significant, were\ntherefore removed from the model, to give the final model\n(table 1), in which the interaction between senescence class\nand early-life NAO had a significant effect. Alternatively,\nwhen the interaction with early-life NAO was removed and\nthe interaction with early-life colony success was retained,\nthe latter remained significant (effect of senescence\ncolony success in model without early-class# early-life\nlife NAO or its interaction with senescence class:\n, , ,estimatep 7.469\u0003 2.879 Waldp 6.73 dfp 1 Pp\n). This effect was also in the predicted direction (in-.009\ndividuals experiencing poorer early conditions subsequently\nsenesce faster; fig. 5C). The final model reported in table 1\npresents the results for the model using early-life NAO only.\nThe GLMM including relative laying date showed a highly\nsignificant negative effect of relative laying date on breeding\nsuccess, confirming that late-breeding birds perform con-\nsistently poorer (relative laying ,datep \u00020.081\u0003 0.009\n, ).

Early-life reproductive output\nand its quadratic term also had significant effects on LBS\n(the number of chicks successfully raised across the whole\nlife span; fig. 6B; table 2) in the multiple regression, in-\ndependent of other terms when added first to the model.\nThis relationship was best described by a decelerating func-\ntion: the effect of early-life reproductive output on LBS\nwas stronger for lower values of early-life reproductive\noutput (fig. 6B). There were also strong positive effects of\nreproductive output in the senescence years and RLS on\nLBS, independent of early-life reproductive output (table\n2).\nDiscussion\nHere we provide clear evidence for within-individual re-\nproductive senescence in a long-lived seabird species, with\ndeclines in reproductive performance in the final years of\nlife. Senescent individuals were less likely to hold a breed-\ning site, to attempt to breed, and to raise a chick. Detecting\nreproductive senescence in wild bird populations is dif-\nficult, and few studies have unequivocally demonstrated\nits existence at the level of the individual (Nisbet 2001;\nReid et al. 2003; Catry et al. 2006). The recent studies of\nRicklefs (2000) and Coulson and Fairweather (2001) sug-\ngest that the primary reason reproductive senescence is so\nrarely detected in birds is that in general, birds manage to\nmaintain their bodies in a state of high physiological con-\ndition right up until the end of life. For example, Ricklefs\n(2000) drew attention to the fact that intrinsic rates of\nage-related mortality are broadly similar between captive\nand wild birds, suggesting that progressive reproductive\nsenescence is not necessarily something we expect to ob-\nserve in nature (Ricklefs 2000). A sudden drop in physi-\nological condition (and hence reproductive output) ob-\nserved at the very end of life, therefore, could be viewed\nas the result of pathological terminal illness rather than\nconventional senescence, that is, a general and progressive\ndecline in performance in the years leading up to the death\nof individuals. In our study, however, reductions in breed-\ning performance became apparent in guillemots 2\u20133 years\nE98 The American Naturalist\nFigure 6: A, Effect of early-life reproductive output on reproductive life\nspan.

This contrasts with the situation\ndescribed by Coulson and Fairweather (2001) for black-\nlegged kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla breeding in northeast En-\ngland, where individuals seemed to perform significantly\nworse on their final breeding attempt, irrespective of age,\nbut no worse in their penultimate or third-to-last attempts.\nWe could not detect senescence effects in younger birds\n(birds breeding for !8 years) in this study, in the ultimate\nyear or any other year preceding the death of individuals;\ndeclines in breeding success were apparent only for older\nbirds (in the last 2\u20133 years of life), again pointing toward\nprogressive senescence rather than terminal illness. Fur-\nthermore, senescent effects may be subtle and may affect\nother aspects of performance such as foraging, as high-\nlighted by a recent study on gray-headed albatrosses (Thal-\nassarche chrysostoma) by Catry et al. (2006), and hence\nthey may not necessarily result in complete breeding failure\nof older pairs but rather progressive reductions in breeding\nsuccess. We do not know the mechanism driving the de-\nclines in guillemots, but foraging capabilities and chick-\nfeeding rates may well be important determinants of late-\nlife success. It is of course possible that old guillemots\nbegin to suffer from impaired locomotory or cognitive\ncapacities, for example, from a much earlier stage but man-\nage nevertheless to maintain high levels of productivity by\ncompensating, that is, by investing relatively more energy\nand resources in reproduction as they age (e.g., Velando\net al. 2006). Further studies on the more subtle effects of\naging in birds will be important in testing these ideas.\nThe analytical technique employed in this study of\nquantifying senescent reductions in breeding success in\nthe years leading up to death of individuals represents a\nnovel approach to tackling the problem of senescence.\nSelective disappearance after survival selection is a long-\nstanding general problem in studies of age-related breeding\nperformance and can hamper the detection of senescent\ndeclines (Cam and Monnat 2000; Nisbet 2001; Reid et al.\n2003; van de Pol and Verhulst 2006). Our method cir-\ncumvents this pitfall by effectively aligning individual life\nhistories so that progressive differences in the average qual-\nity of age cohorts due to selective disappearance are no\nlonger an issue; all individuals now \u201cdisappear\u201d at the same\npoint. There may still be quality differences between in-\ndividuals, and this may affect how long they live, but it\nwill not impede the detection of senescence using this\nprocedure. In general, mixed models represent a powerful\napproach to the study of senescence because they can con-\ntrol for between-individual variation in quality, thereby\nenabling within-individual senescent declines to be mea-\nsured independently (Nussey et al. 2006; van de Pol and\nVerhulst 2006). Furthermore, our mixed-model approach\nallows senescence to be modeled without prior knowledge\nof true age, which is often necessary in studies of birds\nthat are difficult or impossible to age once mature (see\nalso Crespin et al. 2006). Our results were also in con-\ncordance with a previous analysis of reproductive senes-\ncence in this population (Crespin et al. 2006) that em-\nployed a different methodology through the use of a\nsurrogate measure for age (TFC). Inclusion of TFC in our\nmodels does not change our conclusions, implying that\ninformation on age is not necessary for senescence to be\nadequately described by the current method.\nFemale guillemots were found to senesce at a signifi-\ncantly faster rate than males. This is the first demonstra-\ntion, to our knowledge, of sex differences in within-\nReproductive Senescence in a Long-Lived Seabird E99\nTable 2: ANOVA table for multiple regression analysis of lifetime breeding\nsuccess showing significant effects\ndf SS F P value\nEarly-life reproductive output 1 3,108.96 2,345.9 !.001\n(Early-life reproductive output)2 1 95.71 72.2 !.001\nOutput in senescent years 1 410.08 309.4 !.001\nReproductive life span 1 78.78 59.4 !.001\nResidual 233 308.79\nNote: Early-life reproductive output and output in senescent years were both mea-\nsured here as number of chicks successfully raised in these periods.

Evolutionary theories of senescence (antago-\nnistic pleiotropy and disposable soma) predict that the sex\nwith the higher rate of mortality will suffer more rapid\nsenescence because selection for increased investment in\nearly reproduction over somatic repair (or for genes with\nantagonistic early- and late-life fitness effects) will be\nstronger in this sex, with negative knock-on effects on late-\nlife vigor (Williams 1957). Males and females may thus\nexhibit different allocation strategies based on mortality\nrisk, which may affect the degree to which senescence is\nmanifested in each sex. However, there do not appear to\nbe overall sex differences in mortality rate in this popu-\nlation (annual survival of [\u0003SE],malesp 95.4%\u0003 0.9%\n; Harris et al. 2000). We foundfemalesp 95.3%\u0003 0.6%\nno evidence for increased investment in early reproduction\nby females relative to males; rather, we found the opposite,\nsince females appeared to have lower average reproductive\noutput in the first half of their lives. Thus, our finding of\nsex differences in senescence rate in guillemots could not\nbe explained by our current understanding of mortality\ndifferences or differences in levels or costs of early repro-\nduction. Cumulative reproductive costs, for example, due\nto egg production or higher chick-feeding rates (Wanless\nand Harris 1986), over the entire presenescent period\ncould nevertheless be greater for females, and this could\nresult in reduced condition of females relative to males in\nthe senescent years. An alternative explanation could be\nthat males switch partner more frequently as they get older\nin favor of better-quality (perhaps younger) females; how-\never, previous work on this population suggests that mate\nswitching is costly for males rather than beneficial (Lewis\net al. 2006).\nIndividual rates of senescence were associated with levels\nof early-life reproductive effort. Guillemots investing\nheavily in reproduction during the first half of their re-\nproductive careers had significantly reduced breeding suc-\ncess in the senescent years. This demonstration of a trade-\noff between early- and late-life reproduction provides rare\nevidence in favor of the antagonistic-pleiotropy and dis-\nposable-soma theories for the evolution of aging (although\nit does not exclude the possibility of other mechanisms\nalso contributing to senescence). Despite a large body of\ntheory, empirical tests of this key prediction have seldom\nbeen carried out, particularly in free-living vertebrate pop-\nulations. Nussey et al. (2006) provided the first test in\nmammals, showing that female red deer Cervus elaphus\nreproducing more frequently in early life subsequently ex-\nhibit stronger declines in offspring birth weight and de-\nlayed calving dates in old age. Trade-offs between early-\nand late-life reproductive performance have also been\nshown to exist in birds (Gustafsson and Pa\u00a8rt 1990; Reid\net al. 2003). Gustafsson and Pa\u00a8rt (1990), for example,\ndemonstrated that female collared flycatchers (Ficedula al-\nbicollis) laid smaller clutches late in life when subjected to\nexperimentally enlarged broods early in life. Similarly, re-\nductions in late-life survival resulting from heightened lev-\nels of early reproduction have been detected in passerine\nbirds (McCleery et al. 1996; Orell and Belda 2002) and\nhumans (Pettay et al. 2005). In this study, however, we\nfocus on rates of decline in reproductive performance,\nrather than absolute performance levels late in life, and\nprovide a clear demonstration of a trade-off with early\nreproduction. Furthermore, we show that rates of repro-\nductive senescence are also dependent on environmental\nconditions experienced early in life; individuals that faced\npoorer general conditions during their early years subse-\nquently senesced at faster rates. We suggest that this in-\ncreased rate of senescence associated with poorer early\nenvironmental conditions results from the increased costs\nof reproduction under such circumstances. If, for example,\nfood was generally less available for these birds, producing\nand feeding a given number of chicks during early life\nwould have been relatively more costly than producing\nand feeding the same amount under more favorable con-\nditions. We controlled for differences between individuals\nin the number of chicks produced during early life in our\nmodel as well as for other potentially confounding sources\nof variation, such as temporal deteriorations in the en-\nvironment and sex effects, and we were still able to dem-\nE100 The American Naturalist\nonstrate this independent effect of early environment on\nrate of senescence. These delayed costs of early energy\nexpenditure thus provide a direct illustration of how\npatterns of senescence invoked by the disposable-soma\nhypothesis might be modulated. This important phenom-\nenon is largely ignored in laboratory studies, where en-\nvironmental variation is kept to a minimum. It is thus\ncrucial to also examine senescence within the natural eco-\nlogical context under which it evolved, and further detailed\nstudies exploring potential environmental effects will be\nessential in determining the generality of this result. Fur-\nthermore, our results highlight the fact that if conditions\ncontinue to deteriorate at this colony (2004 and 2006 were\nthe worst breeding years on record since 1980), then these\nresidual effects of early conditions will continue to impact\nthe dynamics of the colony over the next 20 years or so\nas current cohorts age.\nFinally, we have shown that life span in guillemots is\nalso dependent on the level of early-life reproductive out-\nput: individuals with very high levels of early reproductive\neffort did not live as long. Reproductive life span is the\nmost important component of lifetime breeding success\nin this population and is generally considered to be of key\nimportance in seabird life histories, which are character-\nized by low annual reproductive output and high survival\n(Moreno 2003). The hardest-working individuals (those\nthat invested most in early reproduction) exhibited more\nsenescence in the last 3 years of life and also died sooner,\nand both of these factors explain why birds obtain in-\ncreasingly less advantage, in terms of lifetime breeding\nsuccess, from having very high fecundity early in life. We\nalso show that individuals with high early-life reproductive\noutput have reduced breeding success late in life regardless\nof when in the season they lay, implying that delayed costs\nof reproduction are associated with increased intrinsic\n(physiological) senescence and loss of function late in life\nindependent of breeding time. These results have impli-\ncations for the optimization of individual life-history strat-\negies and highlight the value of long-term, individual-level\ndata from wild populations in developing a more com-\nprehensive understanding of the ecological causes and evo-\nlutionary consequences of senescence.\nAcknowledgments\nWe wish to thank many people who collected field data\nover the years and Scottish Natural Heritage for allowing\nus to work on the Isle of May National Nature Reserve.\nThe fieldwork was funded by the Natural Environment\nResearch Council and the Joint Nature Conservation\nCommittee\u2019s integrated Seabird Monitoring Programme.\nWe also thank S.
