This\ninterpretation is consistent with theory. The reaction mechanism supports the assignment of the observed\nstate as the 5=2\u0001 hole state. This assignment and the recently observed 3=2\u0001 particle state advance the\nunderstanding of 23O.\nDOI: 10.1103\/PhysRevLett.99.112501 PACS numbers: 21.10.Pc, 25.60.Je, 27.30.+t, 29.30.Hs\nMagic numbers are pillars of our understanding of nu-\nclear structure. Nuclei with one nucleon added (removed)\nfrom a doubly magic core can be described by a (quasi-)\nsingle-particle (SP) model. The emergence of magic num-\nbers is due to the presence of gaps in the SP spectrum\naround the Fermi energy. For energy gaps larger than the\nstrength of residual interactions such as pairing or\nquadrupole-quadrupole forces, correlations are weak and\nno corresponding low-lying collectivity is observed.\nMagic numbers follow harmonic-oscillator shells up to\nN, Z \u0002 20. For heavier nuclei, the spin-orbit splitting\nbetween high-l orbitals produces N, Z \u0002 28, 50, 82, and\n126. The emergence of new shell gaps in light nuclei far\nfrom stability is thought to be related to the effect of the\ntensor force [1]. The (average) monopole contribution of\nthis two-body interaction can be taken into account\nthrough effective SP (ESP) energies which depend on\noccupation numbers. The universal sd-shell (USD) inter-\naction takes into account the effects of residual forces\nthrough a fit to experimental data. Using the new USD-B\nshell interaction to calculate the neutron ESP spectra for\nneutron-rich oxygen isotopes reveals large gaps for 22O\nand 24O at the Fermi energy. Therefore, both nuclei are\npredicted to show characteristics associated with magic\nnuclei [2]. This is confirmed by a high 2\u0001 energy in the\ncase of 22O [3] and by studies of neutron-separation energy\nsystematics in the case of 24O [4]. 23O is sandwiched by\nthese two nuclei with significant subshell gaps, and its\nexcitation spectrum is of importance for shell-model cal-\nculations. While a recent pickup reaction populated the\n3=2\u0001 particle state probing the N \u0002 16 gap [5], the present\nLetter reports on the 5=2\u0001 hole state which is sensitive to\nthe N \u0002 14 gap.\nWe have populated the n-22O continuum by 2p\u0001 1n\nremoval from a 26Ne beam and reconstructed the decay-\nenergy spectrum of excited 23O in order to search for\nresonances corresponding to unbound states. Two-va-\nlence-proton knockout reactions are a good tool to study\nthe nuclear structure of rare isotopes since they leave the\nremaining nucleons largely undisturbed [6]. In this Letter,\nwe use the removal of three nucleons, one of them possibly\nan inner-shell proton, and argue that this reaction populates\nthe n-22O continuum selectively.\nThe experiment was performed at the National\nSuperconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan State\nUniversity. A 105 pnA primary beam of 140 MeV=A 40Ar\nimpinged on a 893 mg=cm2 Be production target. 26Ne\nat 86 MeV=A was produced using an achromatic\n750-mg=cm2-thick acrylic wedge degrader and either 1%\nor 3% momentum-acceptance slits at the dispersive focal\nplane as well as \u000310 mm slits at the extended focal plane\nof the A1900 fragment separator [7]. A purity of up to\n93.2% was achieved with a 26Ne beam intensity of about\n7000 pps. The contaminants (mainly 27Na and 29Mg) were\nseparated event-by-event in the offline analysis by their\ndifferent time of flight (TOF) from the extended focal\nplane to a scintillator in front of the 721-mg=cm2-thick\nBe reaction target. This also gives the time of beam inter-\naction with the target t0. Positions and angles of incoming\nbeam particles were measured by two 15\u0004 15 cm2\nposition-sensitive parallel-plate avalanche counters\n(PPACs) with \u00058 pads=cm, i.e., FWHM \u0006 1:3 mm. The\npresence of a quadrupole triplet downstream of the PPACs\ntranslates this into a position resolution of impinging 26Ne\nparticles on the reaction target within a FWHM radius of\n2.4 mm.\nPRL 99, 112501 (2007) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending14 SEPTEMBER 2007\n0031-9007=07=99(11)=112501(4) 112501-1 \u00a9 2007 The American Physical Society\nCharged particles behind the reaction target were bent\n43\u0007 by the large-gap 4 Tm sweeper magnet [8]. Two 30\u0004\n30 cm2 cathode-readout drift chambers (CRDCs) provided\nposition in the dispersive ( \u0005 4 pads=cm, FWHM \u0006\n2:5 mm) and nondispersive (drift time, FWHM \u0006\n3:1 mm) direction. The 1.87 m distance between the\nCRDCs translates this into FWHM \u0002 2:4 mrad angle reso-\nlution. Energy loss was determined in a 65-cm-long ion\nchamber and a 40\u0004 40 cm2, 4.5-mm-thin plastic scintilla-\ntor whose pulse-height signal was corrected for position.\nEnergy loss was used to separate reaction products with\ndifferent Z [see Fig. 1(a)]. The thin scintillator also gave\nTOF of reaction products from the reaction target with\nrespect to t0. This, together with the total kinetic energy\n(TKE) measurement in a 15-cm-thick plastic scintillator,\nprovided isotopic separation [see Figs. 1(b) and 1(d)].\nThe pulse-height signal of the thick scintillator was also\ncorrected for position. The raw TOF was corrected for\n(i) position on the thin scintillator, (ii) angle and position\nbehind the sweeper magnet, and (iii) the point of interac-\ntion on the target. The TOF corrections approximately\ncompensate for the spread in energy of reaction products\nand account for differences in length of the fragment tracks\nand of the light paths in the thin scintillator. Because of the\nfinite acceptance, a magnetic-rigidity range of reaction\nproducts is selected. For reaction products with equal Z,\nthis translates into TKE \/ 1=A and ToF \/ A [see\nFig. 1(b)]. This finite acceptance and the fact that the\nexperiment ran in coincident mode prevented observation\nof 24O in our setup.\nBeam-velocity neutrons were detected in the modular\nneutron array (MoNA) [9] at a distance of 8.2 m from the\nreaction target with an intrinsic efficiency of \u000570%.\nMoNA consists of 9\u0004 16 stacked 2-m-long plastic scintil-\nlator bars which are read out on both ends by photomulti-\nplier tubes (PMT). The bars are mounted horizontally and\nperpendicular to the beam axis. Position along the vertical\nand along the beam axis is determined within the thickness\nof one bar (10 cm). Horizontal position and neutron TOF\nare determined by the time difference and the mean time,\nrespectively, of the two PMT signals which yield resolu-\ntions of FWHM \u0006 12 cm and FWHM \u0006 0:24 ns. The\nTOF spectrum was calibrated by shifting the prompt\n\u0001-ray TOF peak from a thick-target MoNA singles run to\n27 ns with respect to t0 [see inset in Fig. 1(c)]. A neutron\nTOF spectrum (first hit after t0 \u0001 30 ns) in coincidence\nwith 22O fragments is given in Fig. 1(c).\nThe decay energy of resonances is reconstructed by the\ninvariant mass method. The relativistic four-momentum\nvectors of the neutron and fragment are reconstructed at\nthe point of breakup. For neutrons, position and TOF\nresolution translate into angle and energy resolution of\nFWHM \u0002 19 mrad and FWHM \u0002 3:8 MeV [10], respec-\ntively. The angle and energy of fragments in coincidence\nwith neutrons were reconstructed behind the reaction target\nbased on the ion-optical properties of the sweeper magnet\nand taking into account the position at the target in the\ndispersive direction available through forward tracking\nfrom the PPACs [11]. The target position in the nondisper-\nsive direction serves as a check parameter. The angle and\nenergy resolution of the fragments behind the target are\nFWHM \u0002 6:4 mrad and FWHM \u0002 0:9 MeV=A, respec-\ntively. The average energy loss of the fragment through\nhalf of the reaction target is added to approximate the\nrelativistic four-momentum vector of the fragment at the\naverage breakup point.\nThe experiment ran for two days and produced 5700\nn-22O coincidences. The reconstructed decay-energy spec-\ntrum from n-22O coincidences is shown in Fig. 2. This\nspectrum is affected by the finite acceptance for fragments\nand neutrons. It is biased toward the fastest neutron for\nevents where more than one neutron hit MoNA because in\nthe analysis, only the first hit after \u000527 ns is taken into\naccount. Later hits due to either multiple scattering of one\nneutron or true multiple-neutron events are ignored in the\nanalysis [11]. The most severe of these effects, namely, the\none due to acceptance cuts, has been simulated. In general,\nit results in a strongly decreasing detection probability and\na worsening energy resolution for high decay-energy\nevents (see Fig. 2). In the simulation, a Glauber reaction\nmodel is used. Angle straggling of the fragments in the\ntarget is taken into account, as well as detector resolutions.\nFIG. 1.

The ratio\nof the contributions is 1:2. The simulated decay-energy\nresolution, in qualitative agreement with [12], is found to\nscale as FWHM\u0005 16 \u0001\u0001\u0001Ep and 40 \u0001\u0001\u0001Ep (all energies in keV),\nbelow and above E \u0002 1:5 MeV decay energy, respectively.\nThe numerical factors are dominated by neutron-angle\nresolution and target thickness. For the present resonance,\nthe width due to experimental conditions (100 keV) over-\nshadows the Wigner limit by about 3 orders of magnitude.\nHence its lifetime is not determined. The thermal model\nhas been included in the fit as a phenomenological descrip-\ntion for what we think is mostly a low decay energy,\nnonresonant contribution to the spectrum. The contribu-\ntions from uncorrelated and high decay-energy neutrons\nare small due to the low event rate and the small geometric\nacceptance for such events, respectively. Both contribu-\ntions have been simulated by event mixing [13] and by\nassuming neutron decay from the high-energy excitations\nof 24O discussed in the following paragraph. The resulting\nshapes do not differ substantially from the thermal model.\nThe presence of a nonresonant background in similar ex-\nperiments has also been observed by other groups [12,14].\nThe observation of only one resonance in the decay-\nenergy spectrum might indicate selectivity of the reaction.\nThe spectrum of 23O from Fig. 3 has a 5=2\u0001 state [a\n\u0003\t0d5=2\n\u000b1 hole state with a filled \u0003\t1s1=2\n2 orbital] and a\n3=2\u0001 state [a \u0003\t0d3=2\n1 particle state with an empty\n\u0003\t1s1=2\n0 orbital] as observed in [5]. Equal population of\nthese states is inconsistent with our data (see dotted line in\nFig. 2). Preferred population of the 5=2\u0001 state is consistent\nwith a direct three-nucleon knockout mechanism from\n26Ne whose ground-state wave function [16] has large\nspectroscopic overlap with the 23O 1=2\u0001 ground state [a\n\u0003\t1s1=2\n\u000b1 hole state] and the 5=2\u0001 excited state, but a\nfactor of \u000510 smaller overlap with the 3=2\u0001 excited state.\nKnockout of both valence protons will simply populate the\n24O ground state. However, two-proton knockout [17]\nfrom 26Ne involving one core \u0004\t0p\n and one valence\n\u0004\t0d5=2\n proton populates a wide distribution of GDR-\nlike negative-parity cross-shell excitations in 24O. Such\nexcitations should decay via negative-parity neutron-\nexcitation admixtures of the form \u0003\t0p\n\u000b1\u0003\t0d3=2\n1,\n\u0003\t0d5=2\n\u000b1\u0003\t0f1p\n1, and \u0003\t1s1=2\n\u000b1\u0003\t0f1p\n1. The first\nof these has large spectroscopic overlap with high-lying\nnegative-parity excitations in 23O. The other two will likely\ndecay by neutron emission to the 23O 5=2\u0001 excited and\n1=2\u0001 ground state, respectively, and not to the 3=2\u0001 ex-\ncited state. The subsequent neutron decay of the 5=2\u0001 state\nis the resonance observed in our experiment. Both pro-\nposed reaction mechanisms are consistent with our obser-\nvations. Assuming uncorrelated nucleons and removal only\nby the stripping mechanism, calculated cross sections for\n\u0004\t0p\n \u0001 \u0004\t0d5=2\n and \u0004\t0d5=2\n2 \u0001 \u0003\t0d5=2\n1 removal are\n\u0002 \u0002 2:4 and 0.12 mb, respectively.\nThe decay energy [45(2) keV] of the resonance can be\nrelated to excitation energy [2.79(13) MeV] by adding the\nneutron-separation energy Sn \u0002 2:74\t13\n MeV of 23O [18]\nunder the assumption that the decay populates the ground\nstate of 22O. This assumption could be wrong in two\nscenarios. First, if the neutron decay from the 5=2\u0001 state\nFIG. 3. Comparison of 23O excitation spectrum (this work and\n[5]) to theory [15] (dotted lines, calculation relative to the 22O\nground state, using the HBUSD interaction, a version of the old\nUSD interaction which is slightly modified for heavier isotopes).\nThe negative-parity state in 23O is outside of the USD model\nspace. The agreement is of a similarly good quality as for the 22O\nexcitation spectrum [3], and hence supports the assumed pres-\nence of large gaps in the single-particle spectrum at the Fermi\nenergy for 22;24O.\nFIG. 2.

The thick solid curve\ncorresponds to the sum of the dashed (simulated resonant con-\ntribution) and dash-dotted (simulated thermal model) curves and\nagrees well with the data. Adding a strongly populated second\nresonance at a higher energy as observed in Ref. [5] (dotted line)\nis not consistent with our data. The nonobservation of the second\nresonance corresponds to an upper limit of its population of\n\u000520% relative to the first resonance. The thin solid curve\nindicates the simulated effect of the geometric acceptance on\nthe reconstructed decay-energy spectrum, by assuming an\nenergy-independent decay energy.\nPRL 99, 112501 (2007) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending14 SEPTEMBER 2007\n112501-3\nwas to the first excited state in 22O at 3.2 MeV [a\n\u0003\t0d5=2\n\u000b1\u0003\t1s1=2\n\u000b1 configuration], it would be by\ns-wave emission with a large spectroscopic overlap.\nHowever, the resonance shape of the decay-energy spec-\ntrum is inconsistent with s-wave neutron emission.\nMoreover, the then 3.2 MeV mismatch between theory\nand experiment for the 5=2\u0001 state of 23O would be hard\nto reconcile with the good agreement between theory and\nexperiment of the 22O spectrum which largely involves\n\u0003\t0d5=2\n\u000b1 holes [15]. Second, a high-lying excited state\n(not the 5=2\u0001 state) could neutron decay to excited states in\n22O and produce the resonance in our spectrum. However,\none would then still expect to see neutron decay from the\n5=2\u0001 state, which is thought to be populated strongly in the\nreaction, as a second resonance in the spectrum.\nUsing new USD-B wave functions [2], the spectroscopic\nfactor for the neutron decay of the 5=2\u0001 state of 23O to the\nground state of 22O is 0.059, which is also the reason why\nthe state would not have been observed by Elekes et al. [5].\nThus, with a calculated d-wave neutron SP width of\n90(10) eV (based on 45 keV decay energy), the total decay\nwidth of 5.0(6) eV is extremely small. Still, the calculated\n\u0001-decay lifetime is 4.5 ps corresponding to a partial width\nof only 0.15 meV.\nIn conclusion, observation of the 5=2\u0001 hole state at\n45(2) keV above Sn corresponding to an excitation energy\nof 2.79(13) MeV confirms the presence of a large N \u0002 14\ngap in neutron-rich oxygen isotopes. Together with the\nfinding of the large N \u0002 16 gap through the observation\nof the 3=2\u0001 particle state at 4 MeV this establishes 23O as a\nunique nucleus with two large subshell gaps consistent\nwith the USD shell-model calculations.\nWe would like to thank the members of the MoNA\nCollaboration, G.

This walk does not affect the position resolution\nalong a bar, nor can it be corrected due to inefficiencies of\nthe charge-signal collection. Furthermore, the effect on the\ndecay-energy resolution is negligible, as it is determined\nmostly by the neutron-angle resolution and the target\nthickness.\n[11] N.
