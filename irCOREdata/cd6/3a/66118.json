INTRODUCTION\nNanotubes have attracted a large amount of interest ever\nsince they were first discovered in 1991.1 They can be\nthought of as carbon cylinders with a hexagonal grid and are\nthus fullerene related structures. Their mechanical, thermal,\noptical, and electrical properties have been studied in some\ndetail.2 It was found that most properties depend crucially on\nthe diameter, chirality, and length of the tube. A distortion of\nthe lattice thus affects the energy-band gap. This distortion of\nthe lattice can be achieved in two different ways: ~a! through\nan external force such as, e.g., bending, stretching, or\ntwisting3 or ~b! through an internal excitation, which inter-\nacts with the lattice. It is well known that the interaction of\nan excitation such as an amide I vibration in biopolymers or\nan electron ~in the case of the Fro\u00a8hlich Hamiltonian! with a\nlattice whose distortion is initially caused by the excitation\nresults in the creation of a localized state which, in what\nfollows, we refer to as a soliton. Such a soliton was first\nintroduced by Davydov4 in 1970s to explain the dispersion-\nfree energy transport in biopolymers ~see also Ref. 5 for\nfurther details!.\nRecently, a Fro\u00a8hlich Hamiltonian was studied on a two-\ndimensional, discrete, quadratic lattice.6\u20138 In Refs. 6 and 7,\nthe existence of localized states was studied numerically and\nit was found that their properties depend crucially on the\nelectron-phonon coupling constant. An analytical study con-\nfirmed these results8 by showing that in the continuum limit\nthe set of discrete equations reduces to a modified nonlinear\nSchro\u00a8dinger ~MNLS! equation which has an additional term\nresulting from the discreteness of the lattice. Although a soli-\nton of the basic NLS is unstable the extra term was shown to\nstabilize it for appropriate choices of the coupling constant.\nIn this paper, we extend the study of Refs. 6\u20138 to the case\nof a hexagonal, periodic lattice with a large extension in x\nand a small extension in y directions. We study the resultant\nequations both analytically and numerically. In Sec. II, we\npresent the Hamiltonian and the equations of motion. In Sec.\nIII, we discuss various properties of the equations in the\nstationary limit and demonstrate the existence of an exact\nsolution of the discrete equations. In this limit, we can thus\nreplace the full system of equations by a modified discrete\nnonlinear Schro\u00a8dinger ~DNLS! equation. In Sec. IV, we\npresent and compare our numerical results for the continuous\nMNLS equation, for the full system of equations, and for the\nmodified DNLS equation. Most of our numerical simulations\nare performed for the (5,5) armchair tube. Such nanotube\nwas discussed in a recent paper by Liu et al. in the context of\nnanorings.9 We also discuss briefly how nanotubes with dif-\nferent diameter and chirality could be constructed in our\nmodel.\nII.

NUMERICAL RESULTS\nA. Continuous, modified nonlinear Schro\u00a8dinger equation\nFirst, we have considered the continuous, modified non-\nlinear Schro\u00a8dinger equation ~21!. For this, we have taken the\nradially symmetric ansatz\nc~r ,t !5eiatR~r !, ~24!\nand put this into Eq. ~21!. Then we have solved the ordinary\ndifferential equation ~ODE! using a collocation method for\nthe boundary value ODEs10 and choosing the boundary con-\nditions:\n]R~r !\n]r\nur5050, R~r5\u2018!50. ~25!\nOur results are shown in Fig. 1. For a fixed g\u02dc we have de-\ntermined the value of the function R(r) at the origin, R(r\n50), as well as the value of a for which the norm of the\nsolution is equal to unity. As can be seen from Fig. 1, we\nhave found that for a critical value of g\u02dc5g\u02dc cr\u20192.94 the value\nof R(0) tends to zero. Since our construction is such that the\nmaximum of the solution is located at r50, the value of the\nheight of the solution tends to zero and thus the solution\nceases to exist. We thus find that the critical value of g\u02dc from\nour numerical construction agrees with the upper-bound\nvalue obtained from the variational approach based on the\nGaussian, namely, g\u02dc cr5p .\nNote that the solutions cease to exist when the value of a\ntends to zero. Since we can interpret a as the frequency of an\ninternal rotation, the solutions apparently cease to exist when\nthere is no internal rotation. This can be compared to the\nso-called \u2018\u2018Q-balls\u2019\u2019 which are nontopological solitons char-\nacterized also by a complex scalar field11 of the form similar\nto Eq. ~24!.

Discrete equations\n1. Full system of equations\nFor our numerical study of the full equations ~3!\u2013~5! we\nhave found it convenient to \u2018\u2018squeeze\u2019\u2019 the lattice as indi-\ncated in Figs. 2~a! and 2~b!. The Hamiltonian and the corre-\nsponding equations are given in the Appendix. For our nu-\nmerical calculations, we have used mainly a periodic grid\nwith N15160 and N2520. We have in addition chosen the\nboundary conditions such that the fields at (i50,j) are iden-\ntified with those at (i5imax , j). Thus the type of nanotube\nwe are studying here is a (5,5) armchair tube which is\nmetallic.2 Nanotubes can also be semiconducting and we\nmake a brief comment about the possibility of constructing\nsemiconducting tubes in our model in the last paragraph of\nthis section.\nIn this work, the C\u2014C bond length, 0.1415 nm,12 is nor-\nmalized to unity. Therefore, the tube diameter is 0.6756 nm.\nTubes with different diameter can also be constructed in our\nmodel. We discuss this together with different chiralities in\nthe last paragraph of this section.\nAs starting configuration we have used an exponential-\nlike excitation c i , j extended typically over the lattice points\ni578\u201383 and j53 \u20137 with the lattice at equilibrium every-\nwhere, i.e., ui , j50 and v i , j50 for all i , j . We are mainly\ninterested in the existence of solitons and their dependence\non the value of the coupling constant cx . We have set j x\n5kx51, M520, and E50.142 312. The main goal of this\nwork is to study the dependence on cx . So the exact values\nof j x and kx play a minor role. Hence, we have set them to\none. The choice of M520 is a reflection of the physical fact\nthat the mass of the carbon atom is \u201920310224g .\nTo absorb the energy thus allowing the initial configura-\ntion to evolve into the stationary solutions of Eqs. ~3!\u2013~5!,\ni.e., of Eqs. ~11!\u2013~13! we have additionally introduced\ndamping terms n(dui , j \/dt) and n(dv i , j \/dt), respectively,\ninto Eqs. ~4! and ~5!. We have typically chosen n50.25\n20.75. For this choice of the coupling constants, we have\nperformed several numerical calculations using a fourth-\norder Runge-Kutta method for simulating the time evolution.\nWe have found that solitons exist in this system for cx\n.\u201920.

This is of course due to the weaker coupling\nbetween the dynamics of the lattice itself and the excitation.\nFor cx519, we have waited until t\u20198000 and have not\nfound a soliton. Moreover, in all cases we have found only\nlittle displacement of the lattice from the equilibrium. We\nhave found that at the location of the soliton the lattice be-\ncomes squeezed ~i.e., the lattice sites move towards the sites\nat which the soliton is located!. This is demonstrated in Fig.\n3 for cx525, where we show the lattice distortion after t\n54000. The point at which the center of the soliton is lo-\ncated does not move, while the sites in its close neighbor-\nhood all move towards the center of the soliton.\nWe have also studied the effects of perturbations of the\nsolitons. We have found that after perturbing the soliton we\nobtain a new solution with a different height of the soliton\nmaximum. Even after introducing a perturbation which\nkeeps the maximal height fixed, the new solution differs\nfrom the starting one. We thus come to the conclusion that\nthe full system of Eqs. ~3!\u2013~5! has a large number of solu-\ntions for each choice of coupling constants. We believe that a\nconserved quantity exists in this system which picks out the\nspecific solution. However, so far we have not been able to\ndetermine this conserved quantity.\n2. Modified, discrete nonlinear Schro\u00a8dinger equation\nIn addition to the full system of equations, we have also\nstudied the dynamical analog of Eq. ~16!. Using a similar\nstarting configuration with c i , j being exponential and non-\nzero over i578\u201383 and j53 \u20137, we have determined the\nvalue of g\u02dc for which a soliton exists. Our results are shown\nin Fig. 4, where we present the height of the soliton\u2019s maxi-\nmum (cc*)max as function of g\u02dc . We find that the value of g\u02dc\nat which the soliton disappears g\u02dc cr\u20192.295. The height of the\nsoliton at this critical coupling is (c i , jc i , j* )max\u20190.227. Our\nnumerical study of the continuous MNLS equation gave us\ng\u02dc cr\u20192.94, while the analytical study led to g\u02dc cr5p . Both\nvalues are not a bad approximation for the value found nu-\nmerically for the discrete equation.\nTo test the independence of our results from the form of\nthe initial settings, we have used a different starting configu-\nration with two exponential-like excitations being located at\ni578\u201383, j53 \u20137 and i5138\u2013143 and j513\u201317, respec-\ntively. We have found that for values g\u02dc.\u20193, the results\nagree. For both types of initial configurations, the minimal\nenergy configuration corresponds to one soliton. However,\nhaving said this, the time to reach this minimal energy con-\nfigurations is significantly smaller for the initial configura-\ntion with one excitation than for that with two excitation\n~typically one order of magnitude smaller!. We have also\ntested our results as to the dependence on the size of the grid.\nFor this, we have chosen two excitations on three different\ngrid sizes: ~a! a grid with N15160, N2520, and two expo-\nnential excitations extended over i578\u201383, j53 \u20137 and i\n5138\u2013143, j513\u201317, respectively, ~b! a grid with N1\n5320 and N2540 with the excitations located at the same\nplaces as in ~a!, and finally ~c! a grid with N1560, N2\n510, and two exponential excitations extended over i\n518\u201323, j52 \u20134 and i538\u201343, j57 \u20139, respectively. We\nhave found that for g\u02dc53, the results of cases ~a! and ~c!\nagree. For the case ~a! the soliton forms at t\u2019300, while for\nthe case ~c! it forms at t\u2019100. This is not surprising since in\nthe case ~c!, the two excitations are located nearer to each\nother than in the case ~a!. To test the dependence on the\nactual lattice size we have compared the cases ~a! and ~b!.\nWe have found that the larger the lattice the longer it takes\nfor the soliton to form. For g\u02dc53 a soliton forms after t\n\u2019300 in the case ~a!, while for ~b! it forms at t.700. We\nhave thus found that, in comparison with the case of the full\nsystem of equations, the solutions of the DNLS equation are\nunique for each choice of the coupling constant.\nFIG. 3.

ZAKRZEWSKI PHYSICAL REVIEW B 68, 184302 ~2003!\n184302-6\n3. Comparison of results\nSince we have found that in the stationary limit the full\nsystem of equations can be replaced by the DNLS equation,\nthe minimal energy solutions we have obtained for both\ntypes of equations should be in agreement.\nComparing the two systems, we see that the value g\u02dc is\ngiven in terms of the coupling constants of the full system by\ng\u02dc5\n2\n9\ncx\n2\nM jxkx , ~26!\nwhich, for the choice of coupling constants we have used in\nour numerical simulations, gives\ng\u02dc5\ncx\n2\n90 . ~27!\nThus a critical value of cx\u201920 would imply g\u02dc cr\u20194.4. First,\nwe remark that the values of the critical electron-phonon\ncoupling we obtained from all our simulations ~including\nthose for the continuous MNLS equation! are of the same\norder of magnitude. However, there is a slight discrepancy\nbetween the results for the full system and the DNLS equa-\ntion. We believe that this is due to the fact that there might\nexist additional terms A in Eq. ~15! for which D(1)A50\nand\/or D(2)A50. These terms would then appear in Eq.\n~16! and would change the comparison of the solutions.\nHowever, it is difficult to determine these additional terms\nand so this is left as a future work.13\n4. Tubes with different diameter, chirality, and lengths\nSince most of our results are for a (5,5) armchair tube and\nsince it is well known that the properties of nanotubes de-\npend strongly on the diameter, chirality, and lengths of the\ntube, we will discuss briefly how different tubes could be\nconstructed in our model. We have not constructed these\ntubes yet, but we aim to do so in a future publication in\nwhich we intend to extend our approach to a more realistic\nthree-dimensional model.13\nLabeling the first carbon atom in the y direction by j\n50, we have chosen jmax such that it is divisible by 4. Thus,\nthe length of the tube in the y direction is ly5 34 jmax . Since\nwe identify the fields labeled by (i50,j) with those at (i\n5imax , j), the diameter of the tube is given by d5ly \/p .\nThus increasing\/decreasing jmax by 4n , n51,2,3, . . . , we\ncan construct armchair nanotubes with diameters d\n5 (3\/4p) ( jmax64n). Similarly, we can construct longer\ntubes by increasing the number of atoms in the x direction.\nAs far as chirality is concerned, there are two things to\nmodify in our model in order to be able to construct tubes\nwith different chirality. One is to change the number of\npoints in the y direction so that jmax is nondivisible by 4. The\nother is to adjust the periodic boundary conditions in the y\ndirection appropriately. If we, e.g., choose jmax518, we\nhave to identify the fields at (i50,j) with those at (i\n5imax , j11). This then would give us a (5,4) nanotube\nwhich would be semiconducting.\nIn this work, we have concentrated our attention on the\nexistence of localized structures. These structures extend\nover large parts of our grids, but are negligible at boundaries.\nHence, we expect these to hold for systems with different\nboundary conditions, i.e., different chiralities.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nMotivated by a large amount of research done in the area\nof nanotubes, we have studied solitons on a two-dimensional\nhexagonal lattice. We have chosen our lattice to be periodic\nin both the x and y directions and to be of large extension in\none ~x! direction and of small extension in the other ~y! di-\nrection. In the stationary limit, we have found that the full\nsystem of equations in which the electron excitation is\ncoupled to the displacement fields of the lattice can be re-\nplaced by a modified discrete nonlinear Schro\u00a8dinger ~DNLS!\nequation. This discovery of an exact solution of the full sys-\ntem of equations is remarkable since for the similar quadratic\nlattice such a simple solution does not exist.\nIn our numerical studies we have mainly concentrated our\nattention on determining the value of the critical phonon-\nelectron coupling constant. For the DNLS we have found\nthat unique solutions exist and that the value of the critical\ncoupling is in good agreement with both the analytical and\nnumerical values found for the continuous analog of the\nDNLS. For the full system of equations, we believe that a\nlarge number of solutions exist for each choice of the cou-\npling constants and that a conserved quantity exists in the\nsystem. The critical value of the electron-phonon coupling is\nof the same order of magnitude as in the case of the DNLS;\nhowever, we believe that this small discrepancy results from\nthe fact that possible \u2018\u2018boundary\u2019\u2019 terms appear when replac-\ning the full system by the DNLS. These boundary terms are\nthat which are annihilated by either the four-point Laplacian\nD(1) and\/or by the seven-point Laplacian D(2). To find\nthese terms is nontrivial and since this seems an interesting\ntopic by itself, we leave this as a future work.13\nFinally let us mention that a possible extension of the\nresults given here would involve the study of the correspond-\ning three-dimensional equations and\/or of the influence of\nexternal forces.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nB.H. was supported by an EPSRC grant.\nAPPENDIX: HAMILTONIAN AND EQUATIONS OF\nMOTION FOR THE NUMERICAL STUDIES\nTo simplify the numerical construction of the solutions we\nhave squeezed the lattice as indicated in Figs. 2~a! and 2~b!.\nThis reduces the memory requirements and so speeds up the\ncalculations.
