Doi: 10.5194\/angeo-26-517-2008We present a multi-instrument study of the ionospheric response to a northward turning of the IMF. The observations were made in the near-noon (11:00 MLT) sector on Svalbard (at 75\u00b0 MLAT). The data set includes auroral observations, ionospheric flows obtained from the EISCAT and CUTLASS radars, the spectral width of the HF radar backscatter, particle precipitation and plasma flow data from the DMSP F13 satellite, and Pc1 frequency band pulsations observed by induction magnetometers. Careful collocation of all the observations has been made with the HF radar backscatter located by a ray-tracing procedure utilizing the elevation angle of arrival of the signals and an ionospheric plasma density profile. Prior to IMF turning northward, three auroral arcs were observed at the poleward boundary of the closed llbl, inside the llbl, and in the equatorward part of the llbl, respectively. The northward IMF turning was accompanied by enhanced HF radar returns with a broad Doppler spectrum collocated with the arcs. The auroral arcs shifted poleward whereas the backscatter region moved in the opposite direction, which is consistent, respectively, with reconnection beyond the cusp and the capturing of magnetosheath plasma during northward IMF. Locally, magnetic noise enhancement in the Pc1 frequency band occurred simultaneously with the anomalous radar backscatter, and the absence of such signals at more remote magnetic observatories indicates a local generation of the Pc1 turbulence, which is collocated with the radar backscatter.

We present a multi-instrument study of the iono-\nspheric response to a northward turning of the IMF. The ob-\nservations were made in the near-noon (11:00 MLT) sector\non Svalbard (at 75\u25e6 MLAT). The data set includes auroral\nobservations, ionospheric flows obtained from the EISCAT\nand CUTLASS radars, the spectral width of the HF radar\nbackscatter, particle precipitation and plasma flow data from\nthe DMSP F13 satellite, and Pc1 frequency band pulsations\nobserved by induction magnetometers. Careful collocation\nof all the observations has been made with the HF radar\nbackscatter located by a ray-tracing procedure utilizing the\nelevation angle of arrival of the signals and an ionospheric\nplasma density profile. Prior to IMF turning northward, three\nauroral arcs were observed at the poleward boundary of the\nclosed llbl, inside the llbl, and in the equatorward part of the\nllbl, respectively. The northward IMF turning was accom-\npanied by enhanced HF radar returns with a broad Doppler\nspectrum collocated with the arcs.

Ionosphere (Auroral ionosphere; Particle pre-\ncipitation; Plasma convection)\n1 Introduction\nThe entrance into the dayside magnetosphere of new plasma,\nthe characteristics of which are different from those of the\nambient (\u201cold\u201d) plasma, plays an important role in the mag-\nnetosphere, since it may lead to plasma instabilities. In par-\nticular, plasma detached from the plasmasphere and\/or hot\nplasma injected from the magnetotail may stimulate geomag-\nnetic pulsations (e.g. Kangas et al., 1998; Denton and Ve-\ntoulis, 1998). The solar wind can also be considered as a\nsource of new plasma, which forms the low latitude bound-\nary layer (llbl) in the dayside (Song and Russel, 1992). In-\nstabilities in the llbl may lead to the formation of auroral arcs\n(Kozlovsky et al., 2003).\nTheoretically, the penetration of solar wind plasma into the\nmagnetosphere is possible by a number of different mech-\nanisms. For example, it could occur through the develop-\nment of MHD instabilities (Farrugia et al., 1998; Safargaleev\nand Lyatsky, 1991). However, magnetic merging at the day-\nside magnetopause is commonly regarded as the dominant\nmechanism responsible for coupling solar-wind energy and\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n518 V. Safargaleev et al.: Observations of magnetosheath plasma capture during a positive IMF Bz impulse\nmomentum to near-Earth space. A direct penetration of the\nsolar wind plasma through the dayside magnetopause is pos-\nsible during intervals of northward interplanetary magnetic\nfield (IMF). Here, a magnetosheath flux tube reconnects in\nthe north and south magnetospheric lobes, beyond the cusps,\nwhere the IMF is anti-parallel to the Earth\u2019s magnetic field\n(Lockwood, 1998). Newly-reconnected flux tubes shorten\nand sink into the dayside magnetosphere. Since these tubes\nare filled with magnetosheath plasma, the process is referred\nto as magnetosheath plasma \u201ccapture\u201d by the geomagnetic\nfield. The concept of lobe reconnection was supported by\ncase studies using in-situ spacecraft measurements (Onsager\net al., 2001) and ground based observations (Pryse et al.,\n2006). The expected consequences of such plasma capture\nare poleward displacements of the cusp and the open\/closed\nfield line boundary (OCFLB) near noon.\nMagnetopause events can be studied by low altitude space-\ncraft (e.g. the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program,\nDMSP) measuring precipitating electrons and ions (e.g.\nNewell and Meng, 1992), ionospheric radars measuring the\nconvection velocity at the ionospheric footprint of the cusp\n(e.g. Pinnock et al., 1995), and optical instruments observing\nnear-cusp auroras (e.g. Sandholt et al., 1986). Since Alfve\u00b4nic\nion cyclotron waves propagate predominantly along mag-\nnetic field lines, high-latitude dayside magnetic pulsations in\nthe Pc1 frequency band can also be used for such studies in\nthe cases when ionospheric propagation from lower latitudes\ndoes not take place (Safargaleev et al., 2004).\nThe relationship between the precipitation from near-\nmagnetopause magnetospheric domains and the HF radar\nbackscatter from the ionospheric F region has been studied\nby a number of authors (e.g. Baker et al., 1995; Yeoman\net al., 1997; Chisham et al., 2001, and references therein).\nIn particular, they demonstrated that the equatorward edge\nof the radar backscatter with broad Doppler spectral width\nis coincident with the equatorward edge of the cusp parti-\ncle precipitation, and the HF radar spectral width boundary\n(SWB) can provide a good proxy for the open-closed field\nline boundary (OCFLB) near noon. The relationship between\noptical auroras and different regimes of particle precipitation\nhas also been a subject of many studies. The equatorward\nedge of the HF radar spectral width enhancement was found\nto be collocated with the equatorward edge of red aurora dur-\ning periods of negative (southward) IMF Bz (e.g. Moen et al.,\n2001), whereas during intervals of positive (northward) Bz,\ngreen auroras were related to the cusp poleward boundary\n(Sandholt et al., 2001).\nIn spite of this progress, the very limited available sets of\ncoordinated satellite\/radar\/optical observations have thus far\nnot allowed a comprehensive analysis of the magnetospheric\nresponse to IMF Bz northward turning. For instance, the\nsame event of 18 December 1998 was discussed from dif-\nferent points of view in four papers (Sandholt et al., 1999,\n2000, 2001; Thorolfsson et al., 2000). In addition, the IMF\nBz component is not the only factor controlling the dayside\nreconnection. The ratio of IMF Bz\/By should also be taken\ninto account (e.g. Sandholt et al., 2004; Safargaleev et al.,\n2004). Significant IMF variations are often accompanied by\nsolar wind pressure (SWP) changes, which indeed occurred\nin the above mentioned event of 18 December 1998. The\nSWP variations cause deformation of the dayside magneto-\nsphere which depends on the orientation of SWP front and\nmay be different in different events (e.g. Kozlovsky et al.,\n2005). In some cases a detailed analysis cannot be achieved\nbecause of the uncertainty in the time of propagation of the\ndisturbance from the satellite observing the solar wind to the\ndayside ionosphere (Milan et al., 1999).\nWhen lacking experimental data, one tends sometimes to\nrely on the most widespread interpretations of the observed\nphenomena, ignoring other possibilities, which may lead to\nforming the wrong conclusions. For instance, so-called pole-\nward moving auroral forms observed near local noon are\nfrequently regarded as a signature of dayside reconnection.\nHowever, one should be wary of using them as an instru-\nment for locating the cusp or OCFLB without other obser-\nvations, because such auroras may occur independently of\nthe IMF conditions (Fasel, 1995), occurring sometimes on\nclosed magnetic field lines, and can be generated via field\nline resonances (Kozlovsky and Kangas, 2002) or the devel-\nopment of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (Farrugia et al.,\n1994). One further example lies in the interpretation of HF\nradar measurements. In the HF radar data, bands of high\nbackscattered power are widely considered as a signature of\nthe cusp and\/or OCFLB (Baker et al., 1995). However, the\ncusp plasma is not the only source of ionospheric turbulence\nproducing such radar backscatter. Indeed, the turbulence and\nhence the spectral characteristics of the returned radar signal\ncan be affected by magnetospheric ULF waves in the Pc1-2\nfrequency band (Wright et al., 2004) which can be generated\nin many regions of the magnetosphere (Kangas et al., 1998).\nSometimes experimental data from a single instrument\nlead to ambiguous interpretations. For example, Sandholt\net al. (2000) and Yeoman et al. (1997) interpreted the ion\nprecipitation observed by DMSP as a signature of the cusp,\nwhereas Newell et al. (1991) attributed such ions to the\nclosed llbl.\nThus, the present study is motivated by two reasons.\nFirstly, a reliable interpretation in a case study can be\nachieved by joint analysis of the data obtained simultane-\nously from different instruments in the region of interest.\nSecondly, the physical mechanisms acting in the dayside\nmagnetosphere can be understood from numerous treatments\nof this kind. Unfortunately, such multi-instrumental studies\nof the dayside ionosphere are still rare.\nIn the present paper we analyze multi-instrument observa-\ntions of the high-latitude near-noon ionosphere responding\nto a short-lived northward excursion of the IMF Bz compo-\nnent. The data were collected during the joint Swedish (IRF,\nKiruna) \u2013 Finnish (University of Oulu) \u2013 Russian (PGI, Ap-\natity) coordinated optical and radar campaign in Spitsbergen,\nAnn.

Safargaleev et al.: Observations of magnetosheath plasma capture during a positive IMF Bz impulse 519\nwhich was performed to investigate dayside auroras. In addi-\ntion to the instruments traditionally used in such researches\n(i.e. optical instruments, ionospheric radars and DMSP satel-\nlites), data from induction magnetometers are also examined.\nWe show that the sequence of radar, optical and magnetic\nevents accompanying the positive Bz excursion can be inter-\npreted as indications of magnetosheath plasma captured into\nthe dayside magnetosphere. A further purpose of this pa-\nper is to extend the set of IMF transition events investigated\nby documenting the effects occurring in the high-latitude\nionosphere during a \u201cpure magnetic\u201d event (i.e. one with no\nchanges in the solar wind pressure).\n2 Observations\nThe following subsections describe the data used in this\nstudy, including the IMF and solar wind plasma parame-\nters, auroras, precipitating particles, radar observations of the\nionosperic plasma, and magnetic pulsations of the Pc1 fre-\nquency range. A possible scenario, which is consistent with\nthe observations, is then discussed in Sect. 3.\n2.1 Solar wind and IMF observations\nThe Geotail satellite probed the IMF and solar wind plasma\nin the dawnside upstream of the bow shock at [X, Y,\nZ]GSE=[14.4, \u221217.7, \u22120.5]RE . The satellite was located\nclose to the bow shock, so that the solar wind propagation\ntime from the satellite to the magnetopause is determined\nonly by propagation through the magnetosheath. According\nto Lockwood et al. (1989), this time is calculated as:\nTbm \u223c= 0.33Xm\/Vsh, (1)\nwhere Tbm is the propagation time between the bow shock\nand magnetopause, Xm is the coordinate of the magne-\ntopause and Vsh=Vsw\/8 is the average plasma flow speed\nin the magnetosheath. Substitution of the undisturbed so-\nlar wind velocity Vsw=450 km\/s and Xm=10RE into Eq. (1)\ngives Tbm\u22485 min. Shifted by this time, the Geotail satel-\nlite data present interplanetary changes at the magnetopause.\nFigure 1 shows the IMF (in the GSM coordinate system) and\nsolar wind pressure data with such a time shift. The angle\nbetween Bz and By (bottom panel in Fig. 1a) shows the ori-\nentation of the IMF vector in the ZY plane.\nA keogram in Fig. 1a presents auroral activity from 07:45\nto 08:15 UT. There are two auroral intensification events\n(07:45\u201307:55 UT and 08:04\u201308:10 UT) which look like typ-\nical poleward moving auroral forms (PMAFs).\nDuring the first event both Bz and By were near zero (the\ndashed line in Fig. 1a) so that Bx was dominant. Before the\npositive excursion in the Bz component (subsequently ref-\nered to as a positive impulse, PI Bz), the IMF vector was di-\nrected nearly along the y-axis, i.e. perpendicular to the mag-\nnetic field lines at the near-noon magnetopause.

This may result in the magnetosheath plasma\nbeing captured via the reconnection of magnetosheath flux-\ntubes beyond the northern and southern cusps (Song and\nRussel, 1992). The two auroral events are next considered\nin more detail. For the first event, the locations of auro-\nras with respect to magnetospheric domains are studied by\nDMSP data. For the second event, we study the correlation\nof the auroras with IMF variations and enhancements in HF\nradar backscatter.\nAs mentioned above, in many cases IMF changes are as-\nsociated with those in SWP, which complicates the interpre-\ntation. Fortunately, in the events studied here, SWP changes\nAnn. Geophys., 26, 517\u2013531, 2008 www.ann-geophys.net\/26\/517\/2008\/\nV.

The top\nand bottom panels in this figure show the SWP variations\nobserved by the Geotail satellite and a magnetogram from\nthe low-latitude observatory at Hermanus (HER; 34.4\u25e6 S,\n19.2\u25e6 E), respectively. The magnetic measurements near the\nequator can be used to detect compressions of the magneto-\nsphere which are displayed there as step-like increases in the\nH-component. Figure 1b shows no appreciable variations ei-\nther in space or on the ground. This means that the events\nstudied here are associated with a \u201cpure magnetic\u201d impact.\n2.2 Optical and DMSP measurements prior to a positive Bz\nimpulse\nIn this section we focus on the faint multiple arcs that oc-\ncurred ten minutes prior to the PI Bz event. During the oc-\ncurrence of these arcs, the DMSP F13 satellite was passing\nthrough the TV camera field of view. Precipitation data from\nthe satellite make it possible to determine the position of\nthe arcs with respect to the open\/closed magnetic field line\nboundary.\nOptical observations were made by the all-sky TV-camera\nin the Barentsburg observatory (BAB; 78.05\u25e6 N, 14.12\u25e6 E, in\nthe Spitsbergen archipelago). The corrected geomagnetic lat-\nitude (MLAT) of the camera is 75.2\u25e6, with local magnetic\nnoon being at about 08:52 UT (MLT\u2248UT+3 h). This cam-\nera provides high-resolution optical observations of auroras\nin white light. The keogram on the upper panel in Fig. 1\nshows the dynamics of the auroras at the geomagnetic merid-\nian of the observatory. The open arrow and vertical dashed\nline indicate the interval of DMSP F13 passage through the\nTV camera field of view. The interval is characterized by the\nbrightening and poleward displacement of faint auroral arcs\nwhich is not associated with significant changes in the solar\nwind parameters.\nThe top panel in Fig. 2 shows spectrograms of the elec-\ntron and ion precipitation measured by the DMSP satellite.\nHerein, the boundaries of magnetospheric domains are iden-\ntified by the dayside automated region identification program\n(Newell et al., 1991). It is seen that the satellite crossed three\nstructures in electron precipitation (indicated by letters A, B\nand C on the top of Fig. 2) which might be signatures of three\nauroral arcs. All the structures are embedded in the low lat-\nitude boundary layer, llbl. The energy of electrons forming\nthe structures increases toward the lower latitudes (i.e. from\nA to C). Structures A and C are associated with gaps in the\nlow-energy (<1000 eV) ion precipitation.\nBold lines in Fig. 2b present averaged spectra of precipi-\ntating electrons in structures A, B, and C calculated from the\nDMSP data. The dashed lines show Maxwellian spectra cor-\nresponding to the mean energy of the electrons in these struc-\ntures. It is seen that the spectra corresponding to structures A\nand C differ from Maxwellian ones. They have clear peaks\nat energies 150 eV and 650 eV, respectively. These peaks\nand the above-mentioned gaps in ion precipitation indicate\nfield-aligned potential drops (an upward field-aligned elec-\ntric field) above the satellite which accelerates precipitating\nelectrons and suppresses the ion precipitation. The poten-\ntial drops in structures A and C may be associated with up-\nward field-aligned currents at the poleward and equatorward\nboundaries of the llbl, respectively. The electron spectrum of\nstructure B is Maxwellian, which indicates that the electrons\nhere do not undergo field-aligned acceleration.\nThe spectra of precipitating electrons can be used to esti-\nmate the heights of the associated auroras. Using the model\nby Sergienko and Ivanov (1993) and the DMSP data, we have\ncalculated the altitude distribution of luminosity for the in-\nterval considered, which is presented in the lower panel in\nFig. 2. It is seen that the electrons precipitating in structures\nA, B, and C produce maxima in auroral luminosity at alti-\ntudes of 260 km, 220 km, and 160 km, respectively.\nThe three auroral frames in Fig. 3 correspond to the mo-\nments when the F13 satellite was observing structures A, B,\nand C. Geographic north is on the top and geographic east is\non the right side of the images. The bright area in the south-\neast is due to sunlight. The satellite trajectories shown on\nthe frames are mapped along magnetic field lines to the cal-\nculated auroral altitudes of the corresponding structures (i.e.\n260, 220, and 160 km). Crosses show the positions of the\nsatellite at the moments of the frames (indicated at the top\nright corner of each frame). It is seen that the electron pre-\ncipitation structures A, B, and C correspond to optical auroral\narcs intersected by the satellite. These arcs are indicated by\ncorresponding letters on the frames.\nThe fragments of the satellite trajectory are shown by dif-\nferent colors indicating different regimes of precipitation,\nwhich correspond to the spectrogram in Fig. 2a. From\n07:47:44 to 07:48:51 UT, the satellite passed through the\nclosed llbl (green fragment). The red vectors originating\nfrom the trajectory represent the plasma velocity component\nperpendicular to the trajectory, obtained from the plasma\ndrift meter onboard the satellite. At about 07:47:50 UT, just\nafter entrance into the llbl, F13 observed a velocity shear,\nwhich signifies a sheet of upward field-aligned current. This\ncurrent is collocated with the arc A. One more prominent sig-\nnature of upward field-aligned current was observed at about\n07:48:40 UT, which corresponds to the arc C.\nThe central arc (arc B) is located in the region of enhanced\nanti-sunward convection inside the llbl. In contrast to the arcs\nA and C, the arc B is not associated with a noticeable veloc-\nity shear, consistent with a low intensity of the arc-associated\nFAC. The dynamics of this arc are also different from that of\nthe arcs A and C. Namely, the arc B moved poleward, while\nthe arcs A and C did not change their positions. The arc B\nwas moving northward within the region between the pole-\nward boundary of high-energy ion precipitation (indicated by\narc C) and the poleward boundary of the llbl (indicated by arc\nA). As it travelled northward, the arc B reached the poleward\narc A and then disappeared. After that, a new arc appeared\nat the latitude where \u201cold\u201d arc B originated.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/26\/517\/2008\/ Ann. Geophys., 26, 517\u2013531, 2008\n522 V.

The cross shows the DMSP position at the moment indicated on each frame. The\ngreen fragment corresponds to llbl, the yellow fragment is bps. Red arrows are the components of plasma velocity perpendicular to the\nDMSP trajectory. Arcs A, B and C correspond to the structures A, B and C in precipitating particles shown in Fig. 2. North (geographic) is\non the top of each frame, west is on the left. The specious white area in the south-east is sunlight.\nThus, the optical data combined with DMSP measure-\nments show that a few minutes before the IMF Bz turned\nnorthward, i.e. before the PI Bz, the source of central arc B\nwas located inside the llbl, on closed magnetic field lines. At\nthe same time, the arc A was collocated with the poleward\nboundary of the llbl, and the source of arc C was located in\nthe vicinity of the llbl\/bps boundary. In Sect. 3, we will use\nthese findings to locate the ionospheric projection of the llbl.\n2.3 Coordinated radar and optical measurements during the\nPI Bz event\nThe ionospheric convection velocities presented in this sec-\ntion were measured by the European incoherent scatter (EIS-\nCAT) Svalbard radar (ESR) and the SuperDARN (Chisham\net al., 2007) HF radar in Hankasalmi (HANK). The HANK\nradar is one of the two radars forming the CUTLASS bistatic\nHF radar system. The signals returned to the HF radars have\nundergone a Bragg-like backscattering process from field-\naligned electron density irregularities in the ionosphere. The\nCUTLASS data used in the present study have a range reso-\nlution of 45 km (with the first range starting at 180 km from\nthe radar). The HANK scan sector is shown in Fig. 4a by grey\nshading, the bold solid line indicates beam 9 of the radar, and\nthe darker area shows the field of view of TV camera in Bar-\nentsburg. The ESR-32m antenna was pointed to the west at\n45\u25e6 elevation, which allowed us to measure the ionospheric\nplasma flow along the East-West direction in the F-region\n(above 200 km). The beam of the ESR is shown by the bold\ndashed line in Fig. 4a. Panel (b) in Fig. 4 shows the location\nof the auroras with respect to both radar beams.\nFigure 5a shows a spatial distribution (in the geomagnetic\ncoordinate system) of the spectral width of return signals ob-\nserved by the HANK radar during a series of six scans from\n08:00 to 08:15 UT. In this figure one can see a region of\nionospheric irregularities which looks like a patch of large\nspectral width radar returns. The patch appeared at 08:03 UT\nnear the noon meridian (east of Spitsbergen, \u223c120\u25e6 E), then\nmoved dawnwards (westwards) at a constant geomagnetic\nlatitude. At 08:12 UT it reached \u223c92\u25e6 E, and after that it\ndisappeared. The propagation velocity of the western edge\nof the irregularities is about 1500 m\/s. The appearance of the\nirregularityies follows the positive IMF Bz excursion with a\ndelay time of\u223c5 min. Note, that this time is twice the Alfve\u00b4n\ntravel time from the magnetopause to the ionosphere as esti-\nmated by Freeman et al. (1990).\nTime series plots in Fig. 5b show the passage of the ir-\nregularities through beam 9 of the HANK radar. This beam\ncrosses Spitsbergen slightly toward the east of the zenith of\nthe TV camera in BAB (see Fig. 4). These data have a tem-\nporal resolution of 3 s. The focus here is the patch observed\nafter 08:05 UT (the extended line of backscatter before this\ntime is ground scatter from behind the radar). The passage\nof the irregularities is accompanied by an enhancement in all\nmeasured parameters (i.e. power, line-of-sight velocity, and\nspectral width).

This feature hindered the identification of the\narc on the keogram constructed along a fixed meridian, and\nwe have had to highlight the trace of its lower edge with the\nupper green curve in Fig. 6a. The arc C was rather bright\nbut also inhomogeneous, and at the beginning of the second\nPMAF event could be confused on the keogram with cen-\ntral arc B. So, we have also highlighted its movement with\na green curve. Subsequently these highlighted arcs are used\nfor tracing the position of the ionospheric projection of the\nllbl.\nBetween the first PMAF event at 07:48 until about\n08:04 UT, the location of the llbl boundary indicated by arc A\ndid not change. The second PMAF event started at 08:04 UT\nas an enhancement of the arc C. One minute later the arc\nB enhanced. After that, all three arcs started moving pole-\nward, which signifies a shift of the llbl projection to higher\nlatitudes. To highlight the motion of arcs A and C, their equa-\ntorward edges are indicated by green curves on the keogram.\nThe observed poleward shift of the llbl boundary is consis-\ntent with the Combined Precipitation and Convection Model\nby Newell et al. (2004). Indeed, this statistical model shows\nthat for northward IMF in the pre-noon MLT sector the llbl\nis thicker and its poleward boundary is located at higher lat-\nitude than for southward IMF. The position of the llbl might\nalso be dependent on the solar wind pressure, however, in the\nevent considered the SWP was essentially steady.\nTo understand the origin of the ionospheric irregularities\nobserved by the HF radar, it is important to know the lo-\ncation of the backscatter with respect to the auroral arcs.\nCommonly, the echo locations are based on a simple range-\nfinding algorithm assuming straight-line propagation to a vir-\ntual height of 400 km, with the velocity of light in vacuum.\nActually, due to the fact that the ionosphere is a dispersive\nmedium, a signal propagates along its specific ray path with\na group velocity. As a result, the distance to where the echo\noriginates can be smaller that predicted by the standard algo-\nrithm. In Figs. 5b and 6 a correction is included based upon\na ray-tracing estimate (Villain et al., 1984) for this particu-\nlar case. The basic parameters in estimating the group delay\ndefinition were the measured elevation angles of the 11.2-\nMHz HANK echoes (\u223c12\u25e6) and the TRO dynasonde F-layer\nelectron density of about 1.4\u00d71011 m\u22123. (Non-calibrated\nF-layer electron density measurements from the ESR radar\nwere half this value, probably due to snow in the antenna\ndish. No data were available from the Svalbard ionosonde).\nWe found that a Pedersen ray trajectory with \u223c9\u25e6 elevation\nangle can form direct, half-hop F-layer backscatter at the al-\ntitude of \u223c300 km if the model layer has its electron den-\nsity close to\u223c1.4\u00d71011 m\u22123. Note that the raytracing in this\ncase actually gives a result close to the standard SuperDARN\nrangefinding.\nThe top panel in Fig. 7 presents the keogram along beam 9\nof the HANK radar (this beam is shown on the TV frame\nin Fig. 4b by the yellow curve).

This backscatter\nregion is located between the arcs A and C, which are coinci-\ndent with its poleward and equatorward edges, respectively.\nThe arc B is located in the center of the broad spectral width\nbackscatter region.

The vertical line at about\n08:04 UT on the CUTLASS plot indicates the beginning of\nthe broad spectral width backscatter event. At the same time,\na sharp enhancement in the broadband (0.1\u20132.0 Hz) magnetic\nnoise was observed by the induction magnetometer at BAB\n(middle panel in Fig. 8). However, this magnetic disturbance\nwas not observed to the south or to the south-east of BAB\nat the Scandinavian array of induction magnetometers (see,\ne.g. KIL data presented in the bottom panel in Fig. 8) or\nthe Russian station Lovozero on the Kola Peninsula located\n\u223c600 km eastward of KIL. This indicates that the magnetic\nnoise originated from a spatially restricted area of the iono-\nsphere at latitudes higher than, at least, 70\u25e6 N, which could\npresumably be collocated with the region of the broad spec-\ntral width radar backscatter.\nCommonly, magnetic pulsations in the 0.1\u20132.0 Hz fre-\nquency band are associated with the electromagnetic ion-\ncyclotron instability of an anisotropic plasma. In the case\nunder study, such anisotropic plasma could originate in the\nmagnetosheath during the course of reconnection (Anderson\nand Fuselier, 1993). Earlier, such a mechanism for high-\nlatitude Pc1s was suggested by Cole et al. (1982). Then,\nmore recently, Andre\u00b4 et al. (2000) and Wright et al.

The locations of magnetome-\nters BAB and KIL are shown in Fig. 4a.\nUsing the database of DMSP satellites, Newell and Meng\n(1992) have demonstrated that the high-latitude dayside\nionosphere is connected with four different magnetospheric\nplasma domains: mantle, cusp, low latitude boundary layer,\nllbl, and boundary plasma sheet, bps. The ionospheric foot-\nprints of these regions are rather narrow in latitude, es-\npecially around noon where the magnetosphere is strongly\ncompressed by the solar wind.

However, the\nsatellites are usually located far away from the Earth. The un-\ncertainty in the propagation time that stems from variability\nof the interplanetary medium as well as from any separation\nof the satellite location and the Sun-Earth line, may reach\n20 min (Ridley, 2000).\nA correspondence between changes in the solar wind and\nionospheric effects can be easily revealed for sharp isolated\ninterplanetary disturbances. However, such events are rare.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/26\/517\/2008\/ Ann. Geophys., 26, 517\u2013531, 2008\n528 V. Safargaleev et al.: Observations of magnetosheath plasma capture during a positive IMF Bz impulse\nMoreover, in many isolated events, both the IMF and so-\nlar wind pressure change simultaneously, which leads to a\ncoupling of the effects of reconnection and magnetospheric\ncompression (Sandholt et al., 1999; Kozlovsky et al., 2005).\nUndoubtedly, multi-instrument measurements provide\nmore information, which enables a more certain interpreta-\ntion of observations. However, so far the number of coordi-\nnated multi-instrument studies in the dayside ionosphere is\nnot large enough, so that the results obtained in this way are\nnot statistically verified. Therefore, multi-instrument \u201ccase\nstudies\u201d are still needed to improve the statistics.\nIn studying this particular event, a number of fortunate\ncircumstances allowed us to substantially avoid many of the\nproblems listed above.\nFirstly the event shows a distinct positive excursion in the\nIMF Bz component with no significant changes in the solar\nwind plasma pressure.\nSecond, the Geotail satellite was observing interplanetary\nmedium just in front of the bow shock, the propagation time\nbeing as small as about 5 min. Still, this time was calcu-\nlated by Eq. (1), which contains two unknown parameters,\nnamely, the flow velocity in the magnetosheath and the x-\ncoordinate of the magnetopause. Because of the short dura-\ntion of the positive Bz impulse, even a small error of \u00b12\u2013\n3 min in the propagation time may be crucial for the identifi-\ncation of the interplanetary variation causing the ionospheric\nresponse. The situation gets less ambiguous when features\nin the ionospheric convection are taken into consideration.\nThe green curves in Fig. 4b suggest the observation of a half\nof the four-cell convection pattern, with two reverse cells at\nhigh latitudes (see sketch in Fig. 9a). As was shown exper-\nimentally by e.g. Huang et al. (2000), such reverse cells are\ntypical for northward IMF conditions. In the case presented\nhere, the upper green curve in Fig. 4b indicates the pre-noon\nreverse cell, consistent with the positive IMF Bz deflection.\nThird, the DMSP F13 satellite crossed the TV camera field\nof view 10 min prior to Bz turning northward. Three auroral\narcs were observed at that time. The DMSP data revealed\nthat these arcs were embedded in the low latitude boundary\nlayer. Hence, the open\/closed field line boundary (OCFLB)\nwas either poleward of the arc system or coincident with the\nmost poleward arc. After the satellite crossing, we consider\nthe arcs as an indicator of the llbl location. During the inter-\nval of positive Bz, the most poleward arc moved to the north.\nWe then conclude that the Bz turning caused the OCFLB to\nshift northward. This conclusion also agrees with the result\nof Chisham et al. (2004), showing the location of the merging\nline between the focii of the two reversed cells (i.e. poleward\nof the auroras shown in Fig. 4b).\nFourth, an important issue of a multi-instrument study is\nthe correct location of different measurements. In the present\nstudy, for a correct mapping of the optical observations we\nestimated the altitude of auroras using DMSP electron pre-\ncipitation data. The altitudes of the arcs could vary after\nthe satellite pass, however the most important arcs A and\nB are located close to zenith of the TV camera (within 30\u25e6\nof zenith). In this case, a height uncertainty even as large\nas 60 km would yield a location error of the order of 35 km\nwhich is comparable with the spatial resolution of the HF\nradars. For a correct mapping of the HANK radar data, we\napplied a ray-tracing procedure which utilizes the elevation\nangle of arrival of the radar signals and the Troms\u00f8 dyna-\nsonde ionospheric plasma density profile (see also Sect. 2.3\nabove).\n3.2 Interpretation of the observations\nThe sequence of events associated with a positive impulse in\nthe IMF Bz component is described which, as detailed above,\nis consistent with the concept of magnetosheath plasma cap-\nture during reconnection under northward IMF Bz condi-\ntions. The IMF turning from the XY to XZ plane provides\nfavorable conditions for reconnection near the noon merid-\nian. The merging line (i.e. the open-closed field line bound-\nary) appears at higher latitude compared to its previous po-\nsition under southward IMF. Reconnected beyond the cusp\n(see sketch in Fig. 9b), the newly closed flux tubes in the\npre-noon sector drift toward the Earth and dawnward. In\ngeneral, this is consistent with the result of Watanabe et\nal. (2006) who showed that equatorward of the polar cap\nboundary, magnetosheath-like ions drifted from noon toward\nthe flank. Those authors supposed that these ions were of\nmagnetosheath origin and that they entered the closed re-\ngion of the magnetosphere via reconnection. In Fig. 9b the\nmagnetosheath ions are shown as a grey area in the equa-\ntorial part of the flux tubes. Figure 7 suggests that in the\nevent studied here the penetration of magnetosheath plasma\noccurred between arcs B and C, causing a poleward expan-\nsion of the llbl and the embedded arcs A and B. The captured\nanisotropic plasma generates the ion-cyclotron Alfve\u00b4n waves\nwhich propagate along magnetic field lines to the ionosphere\n(red arrows in Fig. 9b) and produce magnetic activity in the\n0.1\u20133.0 Hz frequency band. This magnetic activity is ob-\nserved at the magnetic observatory nearest to the footprint.\nThe wave turbulence is associated with a fluctuating electric\nfield in the ionosphere, which may cause anomalous echoes\nand a broad Doppler spectrum in the HANK radar data.\nSuch an interpretation is based on the coincidence of suc-\ncessful observations made by several instruments. At some\npoints, these results may seem to contradict to the most\nwidespread view on the relationship between the dayside au-\nroras and radar backscatter.\nFirstly, poleward moving auroral forms (PMAFs) ob-\nserved near noon are frequently interpreted as cusp auroras.\nHowever, in the present case the PMAFs were located in the\nregion of closed llbl. Thus, in general, the near-noon PMAFs\ncannot necessarily be considered as indicators of the cusp.\nSecond, the PMAFs are frequently interpreted as iono-\nspheric manifestation of sporadic reconnection. In the\nabsence of other data, the arc B might have also been\nAnn. Geophys., 26, 517\u2013531, 2008 www.ann-geophys.net\/26\/517\/2008\/\nV.

Comparison of the interpretation of the event under study with widely-used interpretations.\nCommon interpretation Observed event\n1 The PMAFs observed near noon are the cusp auroras. The PMAFs were observed inside the closed llbl.\n2 Near-noon PMAs are an ionospheric manifestation of\nsporadic reconnection.\nThe PMAFs are not connected with reconnection directly because:\n1. System of three arcs existed for a long time prior to the IMF\nreconfiguration, which initiated the near-noon reconnection (see\nFig. 1).\n2. Generation mechanisms may be different for different arcs form-\ning the system.\n3. The arcs moved poleward since the llbl expanded poleward.\n3 Equatorward edge of radar backscatter showing broad\nDoppler spectral widths is coincident with the equator-\nward edge of the cusp\nDuring positive Bz IMF the poleward edge of anomalous radar\nbackscatter is coincident with the arcs located inside the closed llbl.\n4 Enhancement in HF radar return signal may be a signa-\nture of the cusp and\/or the boundary between open and\nclosed magnetic field.\nThis feature is a signature of anisotropic plasma captured in the course\nof reconnection beyond the cusp.\ninterpreted in this way. However, we have shown that there\nwere three stable arcs associated with the closed llbl. Their\npoleward motion corresponds to the poleward expansion of\nthe llbl caused by the IMF Bz turning northward. Actu-\nally, the reconnection is not the only mechanism for dayside\npoleward moving auroras. It has been shown that in some\ncases the PMAFs can be caused by other reasons, e.g., by\nfield line resonance (Kozlovsky and Kangas, 2002), inter-\nchange or interchange-like instabilities (Lyatsky and Sibeck,\n1997; Kozlovsky et al., 2003), the Kelvin-Helmholtz insta-\nbility (Farrugia et al., 1994) or even auroral activity in the\nnight side (Shiokava et al., 1997; Safargaleev et al., 2003).\nThird, in many cases, it was found that the equatorward\nedge of radar backscatter showing broad Doppler spectral\nwidths is coincident with the equatorward edge of the cusp\n(e.g. Yeoman et al., 1997). After this finding, the broad\nspectrum is frequently interpreted as a signature of the cusp.\nHowever, we have shown that during positive IMF Bz the\nregion of broad spectral width backscatter may be located\ninside the closed llbl.\nFourth, an enhancement in the HF radar return signal was\nsuggested to be a signature of the cusp and\/or the bound-\nary between open and closed magnetic field lines (Baker\net al., 1995). We have shown that not only the cusp and\nopen\/closed boundary but also the closed llbl during north-\nward IMF can be associated with the ionospheric turbulence\ncausing radar backscatter. In particular, the data presented\nhere show that a spatially isolated noise enhancement in the\nPc1 frequency band occurs simultaneously with the anoma-\nlous radar backscatter. This can clarify the nature of the\nlarge spectral width in radar returns observed in limited ar-\neas, which is still a point of great debate (Wright et al., 2004).\nThe discrepancies between the features revealed in the\nevent studied here and the most common interpretations are\nsummarized in Table 1. This is an important issue of the\npresent study. We emphasize that owing to a variety of inter-\nplanetary conditions and the complexity of magnetospheric\ndynamics, application of commonly accepted views to a par-\nticular event may lead to an erroneous interpretation. For\nexample, in the absence of reliable IMF, plasma flow, and\nprecipitation data, one could interpret the optical and CUT-\nLASS data shown in Fig. 7 as a typical PMAF event initiated\nby cusp reconnection driven by southward IMF, which is ac-\ntually not correct in the present case. Thus, careful study of\nthe interplanetary conditions, ionospheric plasma flows, and\nprecipitation data is necessary for a correct interpretation of\ndayside ionospheric phenomena.\n4 Conclusion\nWe present a multi-instrument study of the ionospheric re-\nsponse to an isolated positive excursion in the IMF Bz\ncomponent. The observations were made in the near-noon\n(11:00 MLT) sector on Svalbard (at 75 MLAT). The data set\nincludes auroral observations (ASC TV camera), convection\npatterns obtained from UHF EISCAT and HF CUTLASS\nradars, spectral width of the HF radar backscatter, particle\nprecipitation and plasma flow data from the DMSP F13 satel-\nlite, Pc1 pulsations observed by induction magnetometers,\nand solar wind parameters measured by the Geotail satellite\njust in front of the magnetosphere. Careful collocation of all\nobservations has been made. In particular, the heights of au-\nroral luminosity were derived from the DMSP precipitation\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/26\/517\/2008\/ Ann.

The northward IMF turning was accompanied by\nthe enhanced HF radar returns with a broad Doppler spec-\ntrum. The dynamics of the area of enhanced radar returns\nsuggests that the poleward displacement of arcs A and B was\ncaused by the development of that area toward the morn-\ning hours. The captured anisotropic plasma generates ion-\ncyclotron Alfve\u00b4n waves propagating along magnetic field\nlines to the ionosphere. At the magnetic observatory located\nnear the footprints of these lines, an enhancement of mag-\nnetic activity in the 0.1\u20133.0 Hz frequency band is observed.\nThe wave turbulence in the ionosphere may also be a reason\nfor anomalous echoes in the HANK radar data.\nWe discuss possible interpretation errors which may be\ncaused by limited observational data. In particular, it is\nshown that in the absence of reliable IMF, plasma flow, and\nprecipitation data, one could interpret the optical and CUT-\nLASS data as a typical PMAF event generated by cusp re-\nconnection driven by southward IMF, whereas the more com-\nplete data set is consistent with the ionospheric response to\nthe IMF turning northward.\nFinally, we have shown that the appearance of anomalous\nradar backscatter correlates well with ULF enhancement at\nthe nearest magnetic observatory. The absence of the sig-\nnal at remote magnetic observatories excludes ionospheric\nwaveguide propagation and, hence, indicates a local genera-\ntion of the Pc1 turbulence collocated with the radar backscat-\nter. This finding may be useful for further clarification of the\nnature of large spectral width radar returns.\nAcknowledgements. GEOTAIL magnetic field and plasma data\nwere provided by T. Nagai and H.
