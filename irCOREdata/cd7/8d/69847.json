We determine the maximal number of conjugacy classes of maximal elementary\nabelian subgroups of rank 2 in a finite p-group G, for an odd prime p. Namely, it is p if G has\nrank at least 3 and it is p+ 1 if G has rank 2. More precisely, if G has rank 2, there are exactly\n1, 2, p+ 1, or possibly 3 classes for some 3-groups of maximal nilpotency class.\n1. Introduction\nThe elementary abelian p-subgroups of a finite group are ubiquitous in the study of the p-local\nstructure of the entire group. They provide useful information on the modular representations of\nthe group and its cohomology ring. The main motivation of the author for this research is concerned\nwith the classification of endotrivial modules of a finite group over a field of characteristic p. The\nanalysis in [1, 9, 10] and [11], lead to the definition of the category E\u22652(G) of elementary abelian\np-subgroups of a finite group G of rank at least 2. It turns out that the torsion-free rank of the\ngroup of endotrivial modules for G equals the number nG of connected components of E\u22652(G),\nwhence the interest to bound this number. Jon Alperin showed that nG is bounded and depends\non p. Note that if nG > 1, then G has a non abelian Sylow p-subgroup with a cyclic center and\nsome maximal elementary abelian p-subgroup of rank 2. Such p-groups have been thoroughly\nstudied by Blackburn ([5]) and in the works involving endo-permutation and endotrivial modules\n([1, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11] and [18]).\nThe objective of this research is to compute an upper bound for nG in the case that G is a finite\np-group and that p is odd. Equivalently, this problem can be stated as determining the maximal\nnumber of conjugacy classes of maximal elementary abelian subgroups of rank 2. This will be\nexplained in the next section, which also contains the proof of the main result:\nTheorem 2.7. Let p be an odd prime and G a finite p-group. Then nG \u2264 p + 1. In particular,\nif G has rank 2, then there are at most p + 1 conjugacy classes of maximal elementary abelian\nsubgroups of rank 2, and if G has rank at least 3, then there are at most p conjugacy classes of\nmaximal elementary abelian subgroups of rank 2.\nIn fact, our conclusion is an easy corollary of He\u00b4thelyi\u2019s work on soft subgroups ([14, 15]), which\nbuilds up essentially from [5]. Let us also mention that Jon Carlson recently handled the case\nfor p = 2, and obtained that nG is at most 5 ([8]). He conjectured that, for p odd, nG \u2264 p + 1,\nwhich is hence true, as we show in Section 2. We end this note by explictly computing nG and the\nconjugacy classes of the elementary abelian subgroups of rank 2 in the case that G has rank 2.\n1\n2 NADIA MAZZA\n2. Generalities: Results old and new\nThroughout, p is an odd prime and G denotes a finite p-group. We write H \u2264 G (resp. H < G)\nif H is a subgroup of G (resp. proper subgroup). If g \u2208 G, we set gH = gHg\u22121 and cg for the\nconjugacy map of G; that is, cg(x) = gx = gxg\u22121, for all x \u2208 G. For two groups H and K having\nan isomorphic central subgroup Z, we write H \u2217ZK for the central product over Z, or simply H \u2217K\nif there is no confusion. Finally, G\u2032 is the derived subgroup of G, generated by all the commutators\n[x, y] = x\u22121y\u22121xy, for all x, y \u2208 G. We refer the reader to [16] for further details.\nDefinition 2.1. Let G be a finite p-group.\n(1) An elementary abelian subgroup of G is an abelian subgroup E of G of exponent p.\nIf E has order pa, then E is a Fp-vector space of dimension a and we call a the rank of E. The\nrank of G is the maximum of the ranks of all the elementary abelian subgroups of G.\n(2) We set E\u22652(G) for the category whose objects are the elementary abelian subgroups of G\nof rank at least 2 and the morphisms are the compositions of conjugations and inclusions.\nFor short, we write E \u2208 E\u22652(G) if E is an object of E\u22652(G). The definition says that for\nE,F \u2208 E\u22652(G), then HomG(E,F ) = {cg | g \u2208 G : gE \u2264 F}. In particular, HomG(E,F ) is\nnot empty if and only if E is conjugate to a subgroup of F . We define a connected component\nof E\u22652(G) as follows: E,F \u2208 E\u22652(G) are connected if there are subgroups E0, . . . , En \u2208 E\u22652(G)\nwith the properties that E0 = E, En = F and, for each 0 \u2264 i < n, one of HomG(Ei, Ei+1) or\nHomG(Ei+1, Ei) is not empty. We call E \u2208 E\u22652(G) maximal if the condition HomG(E,F ) 6= \u2205\nimplies E =G F ; that is, E is not properly contained in an elementary abelian subgroup of G. We\nlet nG be the number of connected components of E\u22652(G). Recall that we want to find an upper\nbound for nG. Since nG \u2264 1 whenever G is abelian or has a non cyclic center, let us exclude these\ncases from now on. Hence, we set Z for the unique central subgroup of G of order p and E0 for a\nnormal elementary abelian subgroup of G of rank 2, which exists by [16, Hilfsatz III 7.5]. Define\nG0 = CG(E0). Note that G0 is a maximal subgroup of G.\nIf G has rank 2, then a component of E\u22652(G) is a G-conjugacy class of elementary abelian\nsubgroups of rank 2. By [1, \u00a7 5], if G has rank 3 or more, then all the objects of E\u22652(G) of rank at\nleast 3 are connected and lie in the big component, denoted B. Moreover, E0 \u2208 B. The remaining\ncomponents of E\u22652(G) are conjugacy classes of maximal elementary abelian subgroups of rank 2,\nthat we call isolated. Hence, E \u2208 E\u22652(G) is isolated if E is a maximal elementary abelian subgroup\nof G that does not lie in B. In particular, Z < E and E has rank 2. Note that nG > 1 if and only\nif G has an isolated subgroup.\nLemma 2.2. Let E \u2208 E\u22652(G) be isolated and set L = CG0(E).\n(1) L is cyclic and E \u2229G0 = Z.\n(2) NG(E) = L \u2217EE0, with L = Z(NG(E)) and EE0 extraspecial of order p3 and exponent p.\nProof. Since E is isolated, the intersection L = G0 \u2229 CG(E) is necessarily cyclic. It follows that\nCG(E) = L\u2217E is metacyclic abelian. Moreover, E0\/G implies that Z < E0, whence E\u2229E0 = Z and\nEE0 is non abelian of order p3 and exponent p, since E normalises E0. Thus, EE0 is extraspecial of\norder p3 and exponent p. In particular, E is normal in L\u2217EE0, which shows that NG(E) = L\u2217EE0.\nClearly, L = Z(NG(E)). \u0003\nLemma 2.2 has the following immediate consequence.\nCONNECTED COMPONENTS OF THE CATEGORY OF ELEMENTARY ABELIAN p-SUBGROUPS 3\nCorollary 2.3. Let E \u2208 E\u22652(G) be isolated and assume that E is normal in G. Then G is a\ncentral product X \u2217Z Z(G), with X extraspecial of order p3 and exponent p, and where Z(G) is\ncyclic. In particular, G has rank 2 and nG = p+ 1.\nHence, from now on, we may assume that if E \u2208 E\u22652(G) is isolated, then NG(E) < G, and thus\nCG(E) has index at least p2 in G. Indeed, by Lemma 2.2, either all isolated subgroups are normal,\nor none is normal. Then, we appeal to He\u00b4thelyi\u2019s work on soft subgroups ([14, 15]), since so are\nthe centralisers of the isolated subgroups.\nDefinition 2.4. A subgroup A of G is soft if A = CG(A) and |NG(A) : CG(A)| = p.\nLet us collect some useful facts on soft subgroups.\nTheorem 2.5. [15, \u00a7 1, 2 and 3] Let G be a finite p-group, and let A be a soft subgroup of G.\n(1) The subgroups containing A form a chain A = N0, N1, . . . , Nk =M , where Ni = NG(Ni\u22121),\nfor 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r, and |G :M | = p.\n(2) M is the unique maximal subgroup of G containing A, and M has nilpotency class k + 1.\n(3) Any two soft subgroups of G contained in M are G-conjugate.\n(4) M has exactly p maximal subgroups containing a soft subgroup of G.\n(5) If |G : A| \u2265 p2, then H = G\u2032Z(NG(A)) is independent of A and the factor group G\/H is\nelementary abelian of order p2. Moreover, for x \u2208 H, then the subgroup CG(x) of G is not\nsoft, or |G : CG(x)| < p2. The conjugates of A are the subgroups CG(s), for s \u2208M \u2212H.\nAs an easy corollary of Theorem 2.5, we get the following.\nProposition 2.6. Assume that G has some isolated subgroup which is not normal in G. Then,\n2 \u2264 nG \u2264 p+ 1 and G has at most p maximal elementary abelian subgroups of rank 2.\nProof. Clearly, nG > 1. Let E \u2208 E\u22652(G) be isolated. Set A = CG(E) and H = G\u2032Z(NG(A)).\nThen, A satisfies the hypothesis of Theorem 2.5. Thus, H is a normal subgroup of G, independent\nof the choice of E, and G\/H is elementary abelian of rank 2. In particular, G has p+ 1 maximal\nsubgroups that contain H and hence might contain some isolated subgroup of G. Now, H < G0,\nsince Z(NG(A)) centralizes E0 and since G\u2032 is contained in any maximal subgroup of G. Since G0\ndoes not contain any isolated subgroup of G, there are at most p maximal subgroups containing\nan isolated subgroup, whence the claim by Theorem 2.5 (3). \u0003\nObserve that Theorem 2.5 provides more information on the structure of G than the fact de-\nducted in Proposition 2.6. In particular, under the same assumptions, the nilpotency class of G is\nn\u2212 r and that of H is n\u2212 r\u2212 1, where r is defined by |Z(NG(E))| = pr. However, for the purpose\nof this research, let us focus on the consequences of Corollary 2.2 and Proposition 2.6.\nTheorem 2.7. Let p be an odd prime and G a finite p-group. Then nG \u2264 p + 1. In particular,\nif G has rank 2, then there are at most p + 1 conjugacy classes of maximal elementary abelian\nsubgroups of rank 2, and if G has rank at least 3, then there are at most p conjugacy classes of\nmaximal elementary abelian subgroups of rank 2.\nCorollary 2.8. The torsion-free rank of the group of endotrivial modules of a finite p-group, for\nan odd prime p, is at most p+ 1.\nWe refer the reader to [8, 9] for further details on Corollary 2.8. We end this section with a\ncriteria stating when nG = 1.\n4 NADIA MAZZA\nProposition 2.9. Let G be a finite p-group, p odd, and let V be a normal elementary abelian\nsubgroup of rank r, with r > p. Then nG = 1.\nProof. We need to show that any E \u2208 E\u22652(G) is contained in an elementary abelian subgroup F\nof rank at least 3. Let E \u2208 E\u22652(G) have rank 2. If E does not contain a central subgroup Z of\norder p, then we set F = EZ. Otherwise, consider V as Fp-vector space. The conjugation action\nof G induces a map E \u2192 AutV . Via the choice of a basis for V , we have that AutV \u223c= SLr(p) and\nany x \u2208 E identifies with a matrix mx in SLr(p) with order 1 or p. If mx = 1, for all x \u2208 E, then\nE \u2264 CG(V ), whence E < V E = F , which is elementary abelian of rank at least 3. Otherwise,\nthere is x \u2208 E with x 6\u2208 V , and E = Z \u00d7 \u3008x\u3009, with Z = V \u2229 E. Then, mx has two non collinear\neigenvectors v, w \u2208 V , since mx is an element of SLr(p) with order p. That is, x \u2208 CG(\u3008v, w\u3009), and\nhence F = E\u3008v, w\u3009 \u2208 E\u22652(G) has rank three (note that Z < \u3008v, w\u3009). \u0003\nLet us point out that Proposition 2.9 is in fact a trivial consequence of a more general result of\nY. Berkovich ([3, Proposition 20]). This discussion naively leads us to the question: \u201cLet G be a\np-group of rank at least p+ 1, for an odd prime p. Is nG = 1?\u201d\nThe answer is not yet known to the author, except in case p = 3.\nProposition 2.10. If p = 3 and G is a 3-group of rank at least 4, then nG = 1.\nProof. By [17, Theorem], if G contains an elementary abelian subgroup of rank 4, then G contains\na normal elementary abelian subgroup of the same rank. The result follows by Proposition 2.9. \u0003\nIf p \u2265 5, then a p-group of rank r > p does not contain any normal elementary abelian subgroup\nof rank r in general, as shown by Professor Glauberman ([13]). Note that the same conclusion is\nsuggested by [2, Theorem A]. However, in the examples considered, it is always true that if G has\nrank at least p+ 1, then nG = 1.\n3. p-groups of rank 2\nThroughout this section, we let G be a finite p-group of rank 2, for an odd prime p. We compute\nnG and describe the conjugacy classes of elementary abelian subgroups of G of rank 2, that is, the\nconnected components of E\u22652(G). Let us recall the classification of the p-groups established by\nBlackburn ([4]). For convenience, we use the notation of [12].\nThere are four types of p-groups of rank 2 ([12, Theorem A.1]):\n\u2022 The non-cyclic metacyclic groups M(p, r), of order pr, r \u2265 2.\n\u2022 The groups C(p, r), of order pr, r \u2265 3, defined by\nC(p, r) = \u3008a, b, c | ap = bp = cpr\u22122 = [a, c] = [b, c] = 1, [a, b] = cpr\u22123 \u3009 .\n\u2022 The groups G(p, r, \u03b5), with \u03b5 = 1 or \u03b5 is not congruent to a square modulo p, of order\npr, r \u2265 4, defined by\nG(p, r, \u03b5) = \u3008a, b, c | ap = bp = cpr\u22122 = [b, c] = 1, [a, b\u22121] = c\u03b5pr\u22123 , [a, c] = b \u3009 .\n\u2022 If p = 3, the following 3-groups of maximal nilpotency class of the form B(3, r;\u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4), of\norder 3r, r \u2265 4. Fix a set {s, s1, . . . , sr\u22121} of generators of G, subject to the relations:\n(1) si = [si\u22121, s], 2 \u2264 i \u2264 r \u2212 1 ;\n(2) [s1, s2] = s\n\u03b2\nr\u22121 ;\n(3) [s1, si] = 1, 3 \u2264 i \u2264 r \u2212 1 ;\nCONNECTED COMPONENTS OF THE CATEGORY OF ELEMENTARY ABELIAN p-SUBGROUPS 5\n(4) s3 = s\u03b4r\u22121 ;\n(5) s31s\n3\n2s3 = s\n\u03b3\nr\u22121\n(6) s3i s\n3\ni+1si+2 = 1, 2 \u2264 i \u2264 r \u2212 1 and with sr = sr+1 = 1 .\nHence, the groups of maximal nilpotency class are given by the sets of parameters (\u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4)\ntaking the values:\n\u2013 For r \u2265 5, (\u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4) = (1, 0, \u03b4) and \u03b4 \u2208 {0, 1, 2} ;\n\u2013 For even r \u2265 4, (\u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4) \u2208 {(0, 1, 0), (0, 2, 0), (0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1)} , except B(3, 4; 0, 1, 0);\n\u2013 For odd r \u2265 5, (\u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4) \u2208 {(0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1)} .\nIn particular, we have isomorphisms G(3, 4, 1) \u223c= B(3, 4; 0, 0, 0) and G(3, 4,\u22121) \u223c= B(3, 4; 0, 2, 0).\nThe group B(3, 4; 0, 1, 0) is the wreath product C3 o C3, which has rank 3.\n3.1. The non-cyclic metacyclic groups M(p, r), r \u2265 3.\nIf G =M(p, r), then G has a unique elementary abelian subgroup of rank 2, by [19, Lemma 2.1].\nProposition 3.1. If G = C(p, r), then nG = 1 and E\u22652(G) = B = {E0}.\n3.2. The groups C(p, r), r \u2265 3.\nBy [12, Lemma A.5], C(p, r) is a non-split central extension\n1 \/\/ Z(C(p, r)) \/\/ C(p, r) \/\/ C(p, 3) \/\/ 1 ,\nwhere Z(C(p, r)) = \u3008c\u3009 is cyclic of order pr\u22122. In addition, C(p, 3) is an extraspecial group of\norder p3 and exponent p and contains all the elements of order p of C(p, r). Thus, we fall into the\nsituation of Corollary 2.3, and so any E \u2208 E\u22652(C(p, r)) is normal in C(p, r).\nProposition 3.2. If G = C(p, r), then nG = p + 1, and each component of E\u22652(G) is a single\nsubgroup.\n3.3. The groups G(p, r, \u03b5), r \u2265 4 and \u03b5 = 1 or \u03b5 is not congruent to a square modulo p.\nWrite G = G(p, r, \u03b5) = \u3008a, b, c | ap = bp = cpr\u22122 = [b, c] = 1, [a, b\u22121] = c\u03b5pr\u22123 , [a, c] = b \u3009 .\nWe have\n1 \/\/ \u3008b, c\u3009 \/\/ G \/\/ \u3008a\u3009 \/\/ 1 ,\nand z = cp\nr\u22123\ngenerates the unique central subgroup of order p. Hence, we can choose E0 = \u3008b, z\u3009,\nand the other objects of E\u22652(G) are Ei = \u3008abi, z\u3009 , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 p. Indeed, it follows from [12, Lemma\nA.6], or from a routine computation, that the elements of order p of G\u2212E0 are of the form aibjzk,\nwith 0 \u2264 i, j, k \u2264 p \u2212 1. Moreover, cEi = Ei\u22121, where the index is taken modulo p, in the range\n1, . . . , p. Thus {Ei | 1 \u2264 i \u2264 p} is a single conjugacy class, i.e. a component of E\u22652(G).\nProposition 3.3. If G = G(p, r, \u03b5), then nG = 2, with components B = {E0} and {Ei | 1 \u2264 i \u2264 p}.\n3.4. The 3-groups of maximal nilpotency class B(3, r;\u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4), r \u2265 4.\nIn addition to the above notation, let us set Gi = \u3008si, . . . , sr\u22121\u3009, for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r \u2212 1.\nThen, G . G2 . G3 . \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . Gr\u22121 is the lower central series of G and Gr\u22121 = Z(G) has order p.\nMoreover, G1 = \u3008s1 , s2\u3009 is metacyclic non cyclic, of index p in G, and G1 is abelian if and only\nif \u03b2 = 0. In this case, if r = 2k, then G1 = \u3008s1\u3009 \u00d7 \u3008s2\u3009 \u223c= Ck \u00d7 Ck\u22121 and if r = 2k + 1, then\nG1 = \u3008s1\u3009 \u00d7 \u3008s2\u3009 \u223c= Ck \u00d7 Ck. Also, if \u3008s\u00af\u3009 = G\/G1 \u223c= C3, then the extension\n1 \/\/ G1 \/\/ G \/\/ \u3008s\u00af\u3009 \/\/ 1\n6 NADIA MAZZA\nsplits if and only if \u03b4 = 0.\nIn any case, G1 has a unique elementary abelian subgroup of rank 2, which is hence characteristic\nin G. Clearly, this subgroup is Gr\u22122 = \u21261(G1), and we have CG(Gr\u22122) = G1.\nNow, we want to determine the conjugacy classes of the elements E \u2208 E\u22652(G), with E 6= Gr\u22122.\nTherefore, we first find the elements of order 3. Observe that any element x \u2208 G can be uniquely\nwritten as x = s\u03b6s\u03b611 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 s\u03b6r\u22121r\u22121 , for integers \u03b6, \u03b6i \u2208 {\u22121, 0, 1}, for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r \u2212 1. From [12,\nProposition A.9], we obtain that the elements of order 3 in G are either in Gr\u22122 or belong to a\ncoset of G\/G2 satisfying \u03b6(\u03b4 + \u03b2\u03b621 ) + \u03b3\u03b61 \u2261 0 mod 3 , with \u03b6 = \u00b11 . The solutions for \u03b61 are:\nr (\u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4) \u03b61\nr \u2265 4 (0, 1, 0) 0\nr \u2265 4 (0, 0, 0) \u22121, 0, 1\nr \u2265 4 (0, 0, 1) no solution\nr even (0, 2, 0) 0\nr \u2265 5 (1, 0, 0) 0\nr \u2265 5 (1, 0, 1) no solution\nr \u2265 5 (1, 0, 2) \u22121, 1\nFrom this table, we immediately deduce the following.\nProposition 3.4. If \u03b4 = 1, then nG = 1 and E\u22652(G) = B = {Gr\u22122} .\nAssume now that \u03b4 = 0, and that G 6\u223c= B(3, 4; 0, 1, 0). Then, the extension\n1 \/\/ G1 \/\/ G \/\/ \u3008s\u00af\u3009 \/\/ 1\nsplits, and we have that \u21261(G) = Gr\u22122 o \u3008s\u3009 is extraspecial of order 27 and exponent 3. Thus,\nexcept Gr\u22122, the group G has 3 elementary abelian subgroups Ei of rank 2, generated by a central\nelement z of order 3 and xi = ssir\u22122, for i \u2208 {1, 2, 3}. Moreover, E1, E2 and E3 are conjugate.\nProposition 3.5. If \u03b4 = 0 and G 6\u223c= B(3, 4; 0, 1, 0), then nG = 2, with components B = {Gr\u22122}\nand {E1, E2, E3}.\nProposition 3.3 handles the cases B(3, 4; 0, 0, 0) \u223c= G(3, 4, 1) and B(3, 4; 0, 2, 0) \u223c= G(3, 4,\u22121),\nwhereas B(3, 4; 0, 1, 0) has rank 3. Hence, we are left with the case that r \u2265 5 and (\u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4) =\n(1, 0, 2). By the above discussion, the elements of order 3 that do not belong to G1 are all the\nelements of the cosets of G\/G2 of the form s\u00b11s\u00b111 G2. Set x = ss1, z = sr\u22121 and let E = \u3008x, z\u3009 =\n{1, x = ss1 , x2 = s2s21s2z\u22121 , z , xz = ss1z , x2z = s2s21s2 , z2 , xz2 = ss1z2 , x2z2 = s2s21s2z} .\nSince x 6\u2208 G1, [16, Hilfsatz III.14.3] shows that E = CG(E), and so, the conjugacy class of x is the\ncoset xG2 \u2282 G\/G2. Notice also that NG(E) = EGr\u22122 is extraspecial of order 27 and exponent 3.\nIt follows that there are exactly two conjugacy classes of elementary abelian subgroups that are\nnot normal in G.\nProposition 3.6. If \u03b4 = 2, then nG = 3, with components B = {Gr\u22122} and the conjugacy classes\nof \u3008ss1, sr\u22121\u3009 and of \u3008ss\u221211 , sr\u22121\u3009.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe author is sincerely grateful to Dave Benson, Jon Carlson, Antonio Diaz, George Glauber-\nman, Adam Glesser, Geoff Robinson and Jacques The\u00b4venaz for their helpful advices and comments.\nThe author also wish to thanks the Swiss National Foundation for its financial support.\nCONNECTED COMPONENTS OF THE CATEGORY OF ELEMENTARY ABELIAN p-SUBGROUPS 7\nReferences\n[1] J.
