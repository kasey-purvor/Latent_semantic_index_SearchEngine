The last approachwas chosen in\nEngland in 2002: the nationwide implementation of\nelectronic health records, known as the National\nHealth Service (NHS)CareRecords Service, is the cor-\nnerstone of the \u00a312.7bn National Programme for IT.5 6\n1eHealth Research Group, Centre\nfor Population Health Sciences,\nUniversity of Edinburgh, Edinburgh\nEH8 9AG\n2Department of Practice and\nPolicy, School of Pharmacy,\nUniversity of London, London\n3Department of Management,\nLondon School of Economics and\nPolitical Science, London\n4Division of Primary Care,\nUniversity of Nottingham,\nNottingham\n5Imperial College Healthcare N\nHS Trust, London\n6Burton Hospitals NHS\nFoundation Trust, Burton upon\nTrent\nCorrespondence to: A Sheikh,\nprofessor of primary care research\nand development,\naziz.sheikh@ed.ac.uk\nCite this as: BMJ 2010;341:c4564\ndoi:10.1136\/bmj.c4564\nBMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com page 1 of 12\nA limited range of standardised applications was to\nbe centrally procured and implemented in, initially,\nfive geographical clusters by centrally contracted\nlocal service providers; these new systems were then\nplanned to connect to a national database and messa-\nging service (the NHS Spine). The resultingNHSCare\nRecords Service is thus in two parts7\u2014a centrally\nstored summary care record containing basic clinical\ninformation for emergencies (which has been sepa-\nrately evaluated89) and a locally held and shared\ndetailed electronic health record. The latter, detailed\nelectronic health record is the focus of this paper.\nThe stated anticipated benefits of the National Pro-\ngramme for IT are summarised in appendix 1 (on\nbmj.com). Previous research into the programme\u2019s\nprogress in hospital trusts reported findings from 25\ninterviews with senior NHS staff from four acute\ntrusts.10 Those interviewees were unanimously and\n\u201cunreservedly\u201d supportive of the programme\u2019s goals,\nbut they highlighted several concerns, including\ndelayed deployments, local financial deficits, and\npoor communication between local managers and the\nagency responsible for the programme. Our research\nbuilds on and expands this earlier work by investigat-\ning the NHS Care Records Service in diverse second-\nary care settings and by interviewing a more\ncomprehensive range of NHS trust staff.\nWe were commissioned to undertake an indepen-\ndent evaluation of early experiences of implementing\nthe NHS Care Record Service in English hospitals to\ninform the subsequent rollout of nationwide electronic\nhealth records. This is, we believe, the largest contem-\nporaneous and longitudinal evaluation of an electronic\nhealth record\u2019s implementation ever undertaken.\nHere, we report interim findings from five \u201cearly adop-\nter\u201d secondary care trusts that have been the focus of\nnational implementation efforts and where the first\nrounds of collection and analysis of evaluation data\nare complete. Our primary objectives are to identify\ninsights and experiences that can usefully shape the\nfuture direction of the NHS Care Records Service in\nhospitals at a critical juncture (triggered by a change in\ngovernment and recently announced austerity mea-\nsures, and plans to restructure the NHS).11 Secondly,\npublishing early results fromEngland\u2019s experiences of\nimplementing an ambitious and expensive IT enabled\ntransformation of healthcare servicesmay offer lessons\nfor other countries that are embarking on large scale,\nnationwide electronic health record programmes.12\nMETHODS\nDesign\nWe are undertaking a mixed methods, longitudinal,12\nsocio-technical,13 multisite case study evaluation (see\nappendix 2 on bmj.com). Data collection is due to\nend in 2011. The evaluation protocol (appendix 3 on\nbmj.com) was aligned to the deployment schedule for\nthe NHS Care Records Service and envisaged a tradi-\ntional before-and-after evaluation design. The design\nwas adapted in response to deployment delays and\nthe diversity of processes for introducing the new\nsystems in England\u2019s hospitals, but the evaluation\u2019s\noriginal aims of informing local and national rollout\nof electronic health records have been retained. The\nadapted approach treats each participating organisa-\ntion as an individual case study of the socio-technical\nprocesses of implementing\u2014and, where sufficient pro-\ngress has been made, adopting\u2014newly introduced IT\nsystems for the NHS Care Records Service. While\neach case study site is evaluated as a distinct enactment\nof the NHS Care Records Service, reviewing findings\nfrom our multiple case studies allows important com-\nmon themes to be identified.\nGovernance and ethics\nThe research was classed as a service evaluation by the\nNHSResearchEthicsCommittee (reference08\/H0703\/\n112). The lead institution is compiling andmaintaining a\nrecord of all data collection activity as themultidisciplin-\nary collaborative team continues to generate a large\nlongitudinal dataset. Prior informed consent to join the\nevaluation was obtained from participating NHS trusts,\nand researchers complied with local requirements for\napprovals on a case by case basis. Informed consent\nwas also obtained from participating individuals. We\nhave protected participants\u2019 anonymity and, as far as\npossible, the anonymity of participating sites by remov-\ning identifying information from the data.\nSampling\nWe used purposive sampling14 to identify 12 diverse\ntrusts across the areas where the National Programme\nfor IT is currently being implemented (London;North,\nMidlands and East; and Southern England) and to\ninclude sites implementing all three centrally procured\nhospital applications (LorenzoandCernerMillennium\nfor acute hospitals and RiO for mental health). Purpo-\nsive sampling was guided by the research aims\u2014to\nstudyNHS hospital trusts in the process of implement-\ning one of Cerner Millennium, Lorenzo, or RiO and,\nwithin the limited deployments to date, to recruit orga-\nnisations with a varied range of geographical settings\nand local deployment strategies. Hence, purposive\nsamplingwas not designed to generate a representative\nsample of all secondary care NHS trusts in England\n(this would have been inappropriate as most trusts\nare not yet implementing the NHS Care Records Ser-\nvice). Rather, we sought to recruit as varied as possible\na sample of early adopter sites from which the breadth\nand,more importantly, the depth of inquiry could gen-\nerate potentially transferable lessons.15-17\nNo invited NHS trust refused to participate in the\nevaluation. We decided not to pursue evaluation\nwork at one trust where there were access difficulties\nafter initial recruitment. Lack of engagement, which\nwould severely compromise data collection, seemed\nto be the result of competing priorities for trust staff at\na time of organisational change.\nWithin each of the remaining case studies, purposive\nsampling aimed to recruit a diverse range of inter-\nviewees with a stake in implementation of the NHS\nCare Records Service, actively seeking different\nRESEARCH\npage 2 of 12 BMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com\nperspectives, including outlier views. Trust inter-\nviewees in the five case studies reported here were hos-\npital managers, members of the implementation team\nand IT staff, doctors, nurses, allied health profes-\nsionals, administrative staff, and, where appropriate,\npatients and carers (table 1). In addition, we purpo-\nsively sampled knowledgeable individuals who were\nnotNHS trust staff andwhooffered additional perspec-\ntives on implementing theNHSCare Records Service.\nInterviewees came from NHS Connecting For Health\n(part of theDepartment of Health Informatics Directo-\nrate and responsible for overseeing the National Pro-\ngramme for IT), strategic health authorities (the\nregional NHS management organisations responsible\nfor local delivery of the programme), local service pro-\nviders (contracted to deploy the NHS Care Records\nService in secondary care), and the commercial com-\npanies subcontracted to supply the applications.\nSettings\nThe reported research is set in five diverse secondary\ncareNHShospital trusts inEngland.These includeone\nsite implementing Cerner Millennium and one site\nimplementingRiO, for which British Telecommunica-\ntions is the local service provider contracted to deliver\nLondon services, and three sites implementing Lor-\nenzo in the North, Midlands and East region, where\nthe local service provider is Computer Science Cor-\nporation (figure). Anonymised information about the\ntrusts is given in table 1.\nData collection\nQualitative data collected at each case study site con-\nsisted of trust documents, transcripts of semi-struc-\ntured interviews (conducted face-to-face, by\ntelephone, and by email), and on-site observations\nand accompanying field notes (table 1). We also\nreviewed specialist IT publications, national media\nreports, and publications by parliamentary and profes-\nsional bodies to track the wider context (macro-envir-\nonment) in which implementations took place.\nWe collected public NHS trust documents and, with\npermission, private ones. Documents collected from\nthe trustswere copies of the trusts\u2019 organisational struc-\nture, deployment timelines for the NHS Care Records\nService, project initiation documents, business cases,\nrisk registers, minutes from board meetings related to\nthe NHS Care Records Service, \u201clessons learned\u201d\ndocuments, training strategy documents, and annual\nreports.

Trust documents provided the local context\nfor each case study and complemented other data\nsources by, for example, allowing comparison of their\ncontents with national policy statements and with data\ngathered in interviews with trust staff.\nInterviews, lasting on average an hour, explored\nindividuals\u2019 expectations, experiences, and opinions\nof electronic health records. The interviewers were\nfive university employees (KC, AT, DP, SC, and\nAR), all experienced qualitative researchers with no\nprior relationships with the interviewees. Early inter-\nviews were guided by topic guides (see appendix 4)\ndesigned for specific interviewee groups. As each\ncase study progressed, the lead researcher at that site\nadapted interview guides and other data collection to\nrespond to previously collected data and emerging\nthemes. Nearly all interviews were audio-recorded\n(table 1). For a few interviews, participants requested\nnot to be recorded, and in such instances the researcher\ntook notes. Professional transcribers transcribed the\ninterviews verbatim, with the interviewers then\nchecking the transcripts for accuracy. Copies of the\ntranscripts were available to interviewees, although\nonly a minority requested to see them; there were\nno cases of interviewees disputing the transcript\ncontents.\nData collection finished at each of the study sites\nwhen the research team judged that saturation had\nbeen achieved\u2014that is, when no new, rich, diverse\ndata relevant to the evaluation were being acquired.\nThis was partly influenced by factors related to the set-\nting\u2014such as the scale of the deployment at the site (for\nexample, limited to a ward or hospital-wide) and type\nof functionalities being introduced (for example,\nordering of tests or clinical notes). The individual\ndata collection periods varied by site (table 1); all of\nthe data reported here were collected between Febru-\nary 2009 andFebruary2010.Wewill revisit each site to\ncollect longitudinal data in order to understand how\nimplementation progresses.\nData analysis\nQualitative data collection and analysis were iterative.\nResearchers combined top-down, thematic coding that\nwas guided by a matrix of socio-technical factors13 and\nbottom-up, inductive coding that allowed themes to\nemerge from the data without prior theoretical\ncategorisation.15-17 From a socio-technical perspective,\norganisational and human (socio) factors and IT sys-\ntem factors (technical) are interrelated parts of one sys-\ntem, each shaping the other.18 Information about the\nsocio-technical approach that provides the theoretical\nunderpinning for the evaluation is given in appendix 5\non bmj.com.\nThe software package NVivo 8 was used to manage\ninterviews, field notes, and documentary data. Data\ncoding was undertaken by the researchers who col-\nlected the data. In keeping with an interpretative qua-\nlitative approach, which recognises the subjectivity of\nthe researcher,16 17 we used a range of approaches to\nvalidate data quality and credibility, including check-\ning for face validity, looking for disconfirming evi-\ndence, data triangulation by data source, and seeking\ninformant feedback. Emerging findings were shared\nwith participating trusts for feedback.

Consequently, it has\nattracted negative media coverage and critical\nquestioning by parliamentary bodies charged with\nscrutinising government spending. Table 2 gives a\ntimeline of programme developments, including\nsome key parliamentary and independent reports pub-\nlished in the course of the programme.\nMajor adjustments to the NHS Care Records Ser-\nvice include departures of two local service providers,\nrepeatedly re-negotiated central contracts, changes to\nNHS Connecting for Health\u2019s staff and governance\nstructures, delays with software, and adjustments to\nthe delivery model\u2014and, in part as a consequence of\nthese, rollout delays. Further, since 2004, over half of\nEngland\u2019s NHS trusts have become autonomousNHS\norganisations (that is, foundation trusts)34 and some are\nnow choosing to implement their own choice of elec-\ntronic health record solutions independently of NHS\nConnecting for Health.\nHence, the envisioned approach to implementing\nthe NHS Care Records Service in hospitals\u2014deliver-\ning standardised applications with phased introduc-\ntions of integrated clinical functionalities\u2014has\nchanged. It has evolved into various IT systems related\nto the NHS Care Records Service\u2014such as patient\nadministration systems, tests ordering, pathology\nreporting, e-prescribing, and maternity systems\u2014\nbeing implemented differently in different hospital\ntrusts. This is a more service based model of deploy-\nment, echoing the \u201cClinical 5\u201d systems identified in the\n2008 Health Informatics Review.28 It may also be seen to\nrepresent a shift from an electronic health record con-\nceptualised as a database of pooled information to an\nelectronic health record as a system to coordinate\ndiverse transactions between clinicians and various\nspecialist services. Deployments of IT systems related\nto the NHS Care Records Service to date range from\nsmall scale, extended \u201csoft launches\u201d of a local service\nprovider application that is still under development to\ntrust-wide \u201cbig bang\u201ddeployments ofmore established\napplications. The implementation area boundaries for\nthe two local service providers that retained their con-\ntracts have become less clear.\nHospitals still want electronic health records\u2014but what\nkind?\nConcordant with earlier research,10 our data indicated\nthat electronic health records were still strongly sup-\nported bymost interviewees despite frequent accounts\nof multiple frustrations with the programme to deliver\nthe NHS Care Records Service. Many NHS clinicians\nsupported electronic health records. A distinctionmay\nbe drawn between the enthusiasm clinicians expressed\nfor imagined, ideal electronic health record systems\nand the more mixed perceptions of those starting to\nuse current NHS Care Records Service applications.\nFurther, clinicians\u2019 enthusiasm for electronic health\nrecords often related to perceived benefits in their\nimmediate surroundings and did not necessarily relate\nto the NHS Care Records Service goal of geographi-\ncally widespread sharing of patient data.\nMain themes from interviews with staff implementing three NHS Care Records Service\napplications at five case study sites\nOrganisational dimension\n\u0001 Organisational context\n\u0001 Getting the organisation ready for change\n\u0001 Infrastructure\n\u0001 Planning\n\u0001 Leadership and management\n\u0001 Trust resources\n\u0001 Teamwork and communication\n\u0001 Learning and evaluation\n\u0001 Sharing lessons learned\n\u0001 Perceived risks and benefits of implementing application\n\u0001 Realistic expectations and timelines\nSocial or human dimension\n\u0001 NHS Care Records Service vision(s)\n\u0001 Needs of stakeholders and perceived benefits\n\u0001 Interactions between stakeholder groups\n\u0001 Attitudes, expectations, concerns, and motivations\n\u0001 Champions\n\u0001 Integration of system with existing work processes\n\u0001 Ownership and resistance\n\u0001 Workarounds\n\u0001 End user input into design\n\u0001 User engagement\n\u0001 Patients\u2019 views\n\u0001 IT literacy in NHS\n\u0001 Training to use new application\n\u0001 Support for users\n\u0001 Realistic expectations and timelines\nTechnical dimension\n\u0001 Data cleansing and migration\n\u0001 Features and functionalities of application\n\u0001 Adaptability and flexibility of new system (customisability)\n\u0001 Integration with existing systems\n\u0001 Stability\n\u0001 System benefits\n\u0001 Usability and performance\u2014software\n\u0001 Usability and performance\u2014hardware\n\u0001 Data security and confidentiality\n\u0001 Smartcard log-in\n\u0001 Legitimate relationships and \u201crole based access\u201d\nRESEARCH\nBMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com page 5 of 12\n\u201cI think, ultimately, it\u2019s a major win-win; it will be\nfantastic if it works, and the sooner the better as far\nas I\u2019m concerned because patients\u2019 notes,\neverything that hangs round patients\u2019 notes and\nappointments, work scheduling, prescribing,\nordering tests, is just so clumsy in a paper world.\u201d\u2014\ndoctor, site B.\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually speeding things up, and it\u2019s more\nreliable about information.

They referred to statements from political\nparties in favour of dismantling the programme, to\norganisational and senior staff changes in the pro-\ngramme, to the history of deployment delays, and to\nthe UK economic recession and related anticipated\ncurbs on NHS spending. Both NHS trust interviewees\nand local service providers expressed fears that pro-\ngress in developing the central NHS IT infrastructure\nand shared detailed electronic health records could be\nlost, with a considerable waste of public money and\neffort already expended.\n\u201cI have my doubts as to the future. Not least\nbecause of the political environment. There is a\nhuge amount of work to get it into an acceptable\nstate, where people will be screaming to come and\nbuy it. If you want to sell something, the best way to\nsell something is if someone wants to buy it.\u201d\u2014\nconsultant, site B.\n\u201cI\u2019m just wondering how does that work [if a new\ngovernment scraps the programme] and what a\nhorrendous waste of money that would be, you\nknow, and if there\u2019s any way of getting that message\nhome to a few people, because I do realise it is a\nvery political thing, but it would be such a crime, it\nwould really be terrible.\u201d\u2014IT manager, site H.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just, um, deeply worried that we\u2019ll miss the\nboat because the plug may be pulled because of\nother political and financial pressures.\u201d\u2014local\nservice provider A, interviewee 2.\nCentrally negotiated contacts and the \u201cruthless stan-\ndardisation\u201d described in the Department of Health\u2019s\n2002 national strategy were designed in part to contain\nprogramme costs.6 The top-down approachwas also in\npart a response to the perceived history of slow and\nuneven development of NHS IT systems before the\nprogramme.21 A major perceived risk now was a pos-\nsible radical swing back to a \u201cbottom-up\u201d approach\nthat would leave responsibility for NHS IT develop-\nments with individual trusts and at best aspires to link\nmultiple local systems using interoperability stan-\ndards. Although a few interviewees perceived benefits\nin the local choice and sense of ownership that a bot-\ntom-up approach would bring, others believed it\ncurrently impossible to integrate disparate systems\nand that attempting to do so would set back electronic\nhealth records by many years.\nAny detailed electronic health record resulting from\na \u201cbottom-up\u201d approach would not be a single, shared\nelectronic health record.\n\u201cStandards and interoperability\u2014what does that\nmean?

Premature deployments had\nnegative consequences for users\u2019 perceptions of local\nservice provider solutions, for instance,where the tech-\nnology itself was not deemed ready by users (such as\n\u201cclunky,\u201d slow to use, unreliable, withminimal clinical\nfunctionality) orwhere therewere publicised reports of\ntrusts struggling with adverse consequences after\ndeployment or upgrade of an NHS Care Records Ser-\nvice system.\n\u201c\u2026 to me it\u2019s a very immature product\u2026 they need\nto take it away for six months and work with some\nclinicians and then bring it back.\u201d\u2014manager, site C.\n\u201cThe issues at [hospital trust] were very big, and I\nthink what tends to happen is, it\u2019s not the reality\never that counts, sadly, it\u2019s people\u2019s perceptions,\nand the perception by clinicians is that it\u2019s all [the\napplication\u2019s] fault.\u201d\u2014implementation team, site A.\nLocal service providers\u2019 solutions were also viewed\nby users as technologically unsophisticated, in some\ncases less good than the healthcare IT systems they\nhad replaced.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a disappointment to have a clinical tool that is\nnot as advanced as what I can do when I go and do\nmy internet shopping for my weekly shop.\u201d\u2014\nclinician, site M.\n\u201cI think the information system that we had before\nwas possibly better.\u201d\u2014clinician 2, site M.\nFurthermore, specifications written into long term\ncontracts did not keep pace with technological\nadvances.\n\u201cThe current log-on method that people have is\nthese \u2018smartcards.\u2019 It\u2019s like antiquated technology.\nIt\u2019s a card that goes in a hole.

NHS interviewees sought systems\nthat were quickly responsive to changing central and\nlocal NHS priorities, hence able to support a trust\u2019s\nbusiness requirements, capable of local adaptation to\nsuit individual trust\u2019s varied processes and work prac-\ntices, quick and reliable for staff to use, and offering\nearly clear benefit to clinicians.\n\u201cI understand they\u2019re trying to put in a national\nproduct, but I think, you know, at the end of the\nday, does one size fit all?

A local health\ncommunity would not conform to a specified geogra-\nphical area, rather it might consist of one or more,\nneighbouring hospital trusts with primary care provi-\nders and associated local community, pharmacy, and\nmental health services.\n\u201cMore than 90% of health care is delivered within\nthat thing [local health community]. Now, of course,\npeople get referred out to [specialist children\u2019s\nhospital] from wherever, but that\u2019s actually\nrelatively rare.\u201d\u2014local service provider A,\ninterviewee 1.\nIn England, hospitals\u2019 services are commissioned by\nprimary care trusts. NHS interviewees thus often per-\nceived neighbouring hospital trusts to be local rivals\nthat competed for business, yet there were also sugges-\ntions for future cooperation and resource sharing\nbetween NHS organisations implementing the same\nNHS Care Records Service application, for instance,\nby placing staff in each others\u2019 trusts.\n\u201cWhat would be useful would be for some of our\nguys, yeah, basically to do role swaps. I mean, in an\nideal world that\u2019s what you\u2019d want to do, you\u2019d\nwant to be able to send some of your staff\u2014whether\nthey be doctors, nurses, physios, porters, whoever\u2014\nto do role swaps.\u201d\u2014implementation manager, site\nA.\n\u201cSo I think one of the lessons the NHS has to learn\nis it needs to drive an economy of scale through\nbringing together of existing capabilities within\norganisations into a bigger, shared service across\nthose organisations.\u201d\u2014IT staff, site B.\nThe need for leadership to realise community level\ncooperation was highlighted.\n\u201cI think we have a problem because there\u2019s a lack of\ntrust between the trusts, so there seems to be a lot of\nsuspicion because of the new arrangements with the\nsort of commissioning provider stuff. I think there\u2019s\na little bit of, what\u2019s the word, distrust, you know \u2026\nIf there was better leadership it would work well,\nbut at the moment we\u2019re kind of treading water, you\nknow, sinking, because the leadership is not there,\nwhich is disappointing.\u201d\u2014IT staff, site H.\nFor someLondon interviewees, includingNHS staff,\nthe proposed model of cooperation between trusts\nreflected prior, personal experience of such resource\nsharing when, before the National Programme for IT\nstarted, three local NHS trusts had cooperated to\ndeploy the same IT system sequentially in their orga-\nnisations.\n\u201cFor the first deployment, the final two trusts had\nstaff project managers and staff working in the first,\nand then the first helped out the second, and then\nthe third. In 18 months we achieved what it now\ntakes about five years to do, because of that\nprocess.\u201d\u2014local service provider A, interviewee 2.\nDISCUSSION\nSummary of main findings\nThese interim findings show that the initial, top-down\npolicy of standardised NHS Care Records Service\napplications in secondary care in England has, for a\nrange of reasons, had to evolve into an approach that\nis more responsive to the circumstances and expressed\nwishes of individual hospital trusts. Although the ori-\nginal plan has faltered, foundations for detailed electro-\nnic health records are emerging as the approach\ncontinues to adapt to permit more local choice and as\nNHS staff and other stakeholders gain greater insight\ninto both the risks and promise of electronic health\nrecords. Deployment delays to date were often attrib-\nuted to an unrealistic, politically driven timeline from\nthe outset. Multiple tensions between a central pro-\ngramme and the local NHS \u201ccustomers,\u201d convoluted\ncommunication lines, and NHS trusts\u2019 lack of capacity\nand readiness for IT enabled change all contributed to\ndelays.\nThe future of the National Programme for IT is still\nuncertain in light of the new coalition government tak-\ning office and forthcoming cuts in public spending.\nSome fear that policy makers might now swing from\nthe initial top-down approach to the opposite, a bot-\ntom-up approach, whereas the more desirable\napproach suggested by several interviewees is a hybrid\nof the two, recognising a place for both central and\nlocal responsibilities and with efforts at sharing\ndetailed electronic health records focused on local\nhealth communities. Our interviewees\u2019 accounts are\nconcordant with the fundamentally socio-technical\ncharacter of electronic health records and the need to\nallow the mutual alignment of the technology and the\npeople who work with it.35 36\nStrengths and limitations of this work\nWeare evaluating aphenomenon that is still unfolding,\nand the prospective, longitudinal design should allow\nus to discriminate between transitory and more sus-\ntained consequences of implementation and adoption\nof electronic health records. Accessing a wide range of\nstakeholder perspectives and multiple data sources\nilluminates changing, multifaceted, socio-technical\nprocesses\u2014and is strengthened by purposive sampling\nof early adopter sites and theoretically informed data\ncollection and analysis. Previous qualitative work has\nfocused on a single group of senior NHS\nprofessionals,10 whereas we are accessing the views\nand experiences of many groups inside and outside\nthe case study trusts, including, importantly, the users\nRESEARCH\nBMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com page 9 of 12\nof the new systems. The comprehensive approach\nshould enhance the transferability of our findings and\nconclusions.\nData collection, coding, and analysis at each case\nstudy site were primarily carried out by a single\nresearcher, which allowed the lead researcher to\ndevelop familiarisation with that site and a rich under-\nstanding of its dataset. This approach, combined with\ntransparency and checking at each stage of data collec-\ntion, coding, and analysis with the wider research team\nand beyond, ensured findings were grounded in the\ndata.\nWe were unable to access confidential local service\nprovider contracts. Partly as a result of this, it has\nproved challenging to gain a holistic understanding of\nthe overall National Programme for IT. Other bodies\nreviewing the programme, such as the House of Com-\nmons Public Accounts Committee have experienced\nsimilar challenges in accessing sensitive commercial\ninformation.26 32\nOur interim findings are based on the first round of\ndata collection from five sites at the forefront of imple-\nmentation efforts, sampling diverse NHS organisa-\ntions and all three hospital applications of the NHS\nCare Records Service. When data collection and ana-\nlysis are complete, we will be able to compare longitu-\ndinal experiences of implementing these applications\nin a wider range of local contexts, reporting from\n11 secondary care settings. Preliminary data from the\nadditional six sites, not yet reported, strongly support\nour key interim themes, suggesting high transferability\nto other early adopter sites. Early adopters may differ\nin important ways from NHS trusts that will join the\nNHS Care Records Service programme later or not\nat all. While the five trusts reported here are likely to\nbe representative of early adopters, we acknowledge\nthey may not be representative of all secondary care\ntrusts in England.\nMore generally, the optimal timing for publishing\nresults of policy-focused evaluations must strike a bal-\nance between providing early formative feedback that\ncan usefully shape policy development and providing\nlater feedback that is strengthened by increased evi-\ndence but is reported too late to influence policy direc-\ntion. Our evaluation is likely to end before new\napplications and new ways of working have reached\nstability, at which time further positive and negative\nconsequences of electronic health records may\nemerge.\nConsidering these findings in an international context\nThe current literature is dominated by reports of single\norganisations\u2019 implementations of, often home-grown,\nelectronic health records,37 but countries such as the\nUnited States and Australia are now embarking on\nnationwide initiatives.38 39 Such nationwide health\ninformation and communication initiatives and their\nconsequences\u2014particularly with respect to data\nexchange\u2014are new terrain.3 40 England, the United\nStates, and Australia are starting with quite different\nhealth services. They are also taking different\napproaches to achieving nationwide electronic health\nrecords, which have been categorised as \u201cbottom-up\u201d\n(US), \u201cmiddle-out\u201d (Australia), and \u201ctop-down\u201d\n(England).41\nA bottom-up approachmight preserve existing local\nsystems and exploit the emergence of interoperability\nstandards in order to exchange healthcare information\nand support the patient journey. In contrast, a top-\ndown approach is centrally directed and replaces exist-\ning, diverse local systems with the aim of creating and\nstoring a single, sharable electronic health record. A\nmiddle-out approach combines central support for\nnational goals and common standards with incentives\nto encourage incremental compliance with standards\nat the local level.41 TheUS government offers financial\nincentives for \u201cmeaningful use\u201d of accredited systems,\nand regional data exchanges are planned.42 43 Hence,\nlocal level choice is more constrained than the term\n\u201cbottom-up\u201d might suggest. In England, the partial\nmigration from a top-down approach towards a mid-\ndle-out approach reflects the interplay of dynamic and\ncomplex interactions in the course of theNational Pro-\ngramme for IT. Arguably, both theUS and the English\napproach are nowmore closely alignedwith eachother\nandwith that ofAustralia, all as variations of a \u201cmiddle-\nout\u201d approach. A major uncertainty remains about\nhow well these approaches will achieve meaningful\ndata exchange that supports patient care, which will\nin part depend on the balance between local level free-\ndoms and constraints.\nPolicy implications\nMajor policy revisions affecting the National Pro-\ngramme for IT are anticipated after the recent election\nof a new coalition government and announcements of\nwidespread cuts to public spending to address the UK\nnational deficit. Even small policy adjustments that are\nbased on early evidence from evaluations can substan-\ntially influence developments in a programme as large,\ncomplex, and ambitious as introducing nationwide\nelectronic health records. For example, interim results\nfrom the evaluation of the summary care record are\nbelieved to have played an important role in influen-\ncing revisions to the consent model.8\nThe health service in England ismade up of a variety\nof diverse NHS organisations, some with considerable\nautonomy as NHS foundation trusts. There is also a\ndegree of competition between local hospital trusts\nthat tender to provide services to primary care com-\nmissioners. Our data highlight an inherent tension\nbetween government policies that have encouraged\ndecentralisation of NHS control44 and a policy to sup-\nply centrally procured, standardised IT systems to\nlocal NHS settings. A further policy tension was evi-\ndent in writing systems requirements into long term\ncontracts forNHS IT applicationswhile national direc-\ntives for service delivery and reporting by NHS trusts\ncontinually change. Similarly, technologies change,\nwhich can quickly result in long term contracts becom-\ning technologically outdated.\nRESEARCH\npage 10 of 12 BMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com\nWe offer four policy related recommendations\nbased on our interim findings. Firstly, it would be\nimmediately helpful if theDepartment ofHealth expli-\ncitly acknowledged inconsistencies between, on the\none hand, promoting NHS internal markets and foun-\ndations trusts and, on the other, the inflexibility of long\nterm, centrally negotiated contracts that exclude the\nNHS trust \u201ccustomer.\u201d Secondary care trusts may\nstruggle to implement electronic health records for\nmany reasons; consistency in the leadership from the\nDepartment of Health combined with clear informa-\ntion about the future of the National Programme for\nIT could help alleviate some current difficulties. Sec-\nondly, it is evident that NHS trusts need to be allowed\nto communicate changing local and national NHS\npriorities directly to those workingwith them to imple-\nment electronic health records, whether this is\nachieved by unfettered lines of communication\nbetween the trust and its local service provider or\nbetween the trust and the application supplier. Thirdly,\nlinking local service provider payments to \u201cbodies on\nthe floor\u201d (the numbers of sites deploying in accor-\ndance with a set schedule of dates) was a strategy for\ncontrolling the cost of central contracts that is creating\nproblems. Linking contract payments to more\nthoughtfully agreed outcomes could potentially con-\ntrol costs and benefit bothNHS trusts striving to imple-\nment and local service providers striving to deploy.\nNHS trustsmay be strongly encouraged to take local\nservice provider solutions but they cannot be forced to\ndo so. To date, some have bargained for greater influ-\nence over system choice, design, delivery, and local\nconfiguration. Simultaneously, local service providers\nhave repeatedly negotiated with trusts, with their sup-\npliers, and with NHS Connecting For Health to re-set\nthe contracts. Public discourse tends to focus on the IT\nprogramme\u2019s troubled history, whereas the greater\nneed is to debate the desired outcome of electronic\nhealth records in the light of the identified policy\ntensions andprogrammechanges.Consideringnation-\nwide implementations of electronic health records\nwith the aid of broad categories such as a \u201cmiddle-\nout\u201d versus a \u201ctop-down\u201d approach is useful but lim-\nited. In England, debates about other important\ndimensions\u2014such as what kind of detailed electronic\nhealth record is wanted, on what scale, and howmuch\nthe country is prepared to pay for it\u2014are still far from\nsettled. Our fourth recommendation, therefore, is that\nclearly answering these more fundamental questions\nshould be policy makers\u2019 first priority.\nConclusions\nThe English experience indicates that a \u201cvision\u201d of\nintroducing nationwide electronic health records in\nthe context of a broader aim to improvenational health\ncare can successfully kick-start an ambitious pro-\ngramme of IT based transformation. Realising the\nvision, however, is likely to be an incremental and\niterative process that unfolds over many years. Such a\ntimescale emphasises the need for flexibility and local\nadaptability, both in the electronic health record sys-\ntems and in how they are delivered to accommodate\ntechnological developments and changing local and\nnational priorities. Public debates pitting centrally dri-\nven, standardised systems versus common standards\nand interoperability might more usefully be reframed\nas a debate about exactly what kind of a nationwide\nelectronic health record is now needed and affordable.\nWhile there is no clear evidence as yet that a middle-\nout approachwill achieve the goal of large scale nation-\nwide electronic health records, international experi-\nence, including England\u2019s, suggests that neither a\npurely top-down nor bottom-up approach is likely to\ndo so.\nWe thank the participating trusts for supporting this work and all\ninterviewees who kindly gave of their time.
