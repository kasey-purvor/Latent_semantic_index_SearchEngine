It focuses on the \nways in which Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) unevenly affect the \npace of life within the urban environment. Based on a detailed case study of how  ICT s \nare being used in an affluent and a marginalised neighbourhood in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, \nthe paper suggests that urban digital divides need  to be understood as more than uneven \npatterns of access. They emerge in this work as more than the presence or absence of \nspecific technological artefacts. Rather, it is argued that different styles and speeds of  \ntechnologically mediated life now work to define urban socio-spatial inequalities. The \npaper distinguishes between two such key styles and speeds. First, the paper argues that \naffluent and professional groups now use new media technologies pervasively and \ncontinuously as the \u2018background\u2019 infrastructure to sustain privileged and intensely \ndistanciated, but time-stressed, lifestyles. Second, more marginalised neighbourhoods \ntend to be characterised by instrumental and episodic ICT usage patterns which are often \ncollectively organised through strong neighbourhood ties. For the former, mediated \nnetworks help orchestrate neighbourhood ties; for the latter it is those neighbourhood ties \nthat enable online access. \n3 \n \nIntroduction \n \nWhilst research on the so-called urban \u2018digital divide\u2019 is well established, it has thus far \ntended to de dominated by aggregate accounts charting of the interaction of two variables \n- access to the Internet and socio-spatial inequality (Compaine, 2001, Holloway, 2005, \nLoader, 1998; see Graham, 2002, 2004).  Such research has successfully traced how the \nleads and lags of on-line access move, over time, between different social groups and \ngeographical areas, whether regionally through economies, or as rural and urban \ncontrasts, as access to Information and Communications Technologies (hereafter  \u2018ICTs\u2019) \ndiffuse unevenly through society.  \n \nThus far, however, such aggregate and quantitative depictions of wide-scale internet \ndiffusion processes have dwarfed efforts to look at the effects that access, or lack of \naccess, to ICTs \u2013 and all the transactional, informational, and communicational worlds that \nthey can open up \u2013 have on individuals, households, and neighbourhoods.  This has led to \nthree  major research problems which we seek to address in the current paper. First, \ndigital divide literature tends to reduce communication and information technologies to a \nset of artefacts whose distribution can be plotted against socio-demographic variables. \nThis, we suggest, puts too much emphasis on artefacts and reads off their uses rather \ndeterministically as stable and unchanging, often assuming they give some sort of \n\u2018technological push\u2019 to society -- for good or ill. Thus, the challenge is to unpack the \npractices and modalities of using ICTs and the ways they configure users and users \nconfigure them. Second, work which focuses upon ways of using ICTs tends to be micro \nscale and eschews dealing with broader social consequences. Third, accounts tend to \nexamine not just individual technologies but individualised users \u2013 downplaying socialised \n4 \nuse and outcomes. It is not sufficient to simply map out aggregate urban digital divides by \nanalysing aggregate ICT users and activities. Rather, we need to look at socio-spatially \nembedded actions and synergies between multiple technologies used in places with \nmutually overlapping effects occurring through those places.  \n \nMultispeed Cities: Beyond Quantitative  \nMappings of Urban Digital Divides \n \nBy way of a critical review of urban digital divides literatures, it is worth elaborating on \nthese three points in a little more detail. Taking the first, much work on digital divides has \nbeen resolutely aspatial. Its main focus thus far has been to relate the presence or \nabsence of specific technical artefacts -- such as the ownership and ability to use PCs \n(Selwyn 2004) -- with socio-demographic variables. Occasionally, these patterns are \nspatially referenced to geographical units at which level the data was collected \u2013 usually at \nsupra-urban or regional scales. That is the focus is the distribution of access, usually \nsocially (for US data see National Telecommunications and Information Administration \n1999; 2000; for the UK Policy Action Team 15 2000; Bromley 2004) but in a few works \nspatially -- such as focusing on variations in connectivity between cities (Townsend 2001), \nand sometimes at the intra-urban level (Baum, van Gellecum et al. 2004; Holloway 2005).  \nThe literature on the digital divide thus has gaps in terms of scale. These works do not \ntend to focus upon the consequences of using ICTs, even though they often imply benefits \nthrough \u2018digital inclusion\u2019. They chart the distribution of artefacts and tend to assume their \nuse and effects. Crucially, however, they also largely ignore the social consequences of \nICT-mediated social inequalities. While theories make often sweeping claims, empirical \nwork rarely looks to the effects on daily life in cities resulting from differential contours of \nthe digital landscape. Research is particularly lacking which explores what it means for \n5 \nindividuals, groups and neighbourhoods to not have access to ICTs in a world where \npersonal, welfare and leisure services are increasingly being fundamentally restructured to \norient themselves towards normalised consumers who do have ICT access. Notably, the \nurban impacts of using ICTs are not just confined to the household. They quickly cascade \ninto other spheres and scales \u2013 producing second and even third order effects, in, say, \nlocal service provision and community dynamics. To adapt Elizabeth Shove\u2019s words, ICTs \n\u2018not only permit people to fulfil necessary practices, they have the further consequence of \nmodifying what those practices are and how they are 'normally' configured and structured\u2019 \n(2002, 2).  \n \nThrough such processes of normalisation, ICT-mediated economic and social relationships \nprovide opportunities for restructuring the time-space dynamics of everyday lives, service \nsupply regimes, and the broader time-space patterns of urban development. The dynamic \nand relational geographies of such transitions reconstitute cities as key spatial pivots \nwithin telescoping scalar relations, operating at near instantaneous speeds, from the scale \nof the body to the transnational (Crang 2000). It follows that those groups, neighbourhoods \nand communities within cities who are marginalised from ICT-mediated links will be \nexcluded not just from physical access points to technology. Just as importantly, they will \nbe distanced from the complex and multiscale constellations of increasingly normalised \nelectronic flows, transactions, and exchanges which operate within, through and beyond \ntheir neighbourhoods.  Consequently, the \u2018social and economic cores and peripheries of \nthe global information \u2018age\u2019, rather than being continents apart, now lie geographically \nadjacent to each other within individual cities\u2019 (Graham 2002, 34).   \n \nStarting from these differential processes of ICT-mediation, it follows that, on a \nneighbourhood level within cities, we may find the emergence of a kind of \u2018multi-speed\u2019 \n6 \nurbanism \u2013 with some areas still stuck in an urban \u2018slow\u2019 lane -- still reliant on the arrays of \nphysical cash, face to face services, and physical service offices which are increasingly \nbeing marginalised or withdrawn as ICT-mediated service systems become both \nnormalised and dominant (Graham, 2002). Equally, we may also find other hyper-\nconnected areas where residents experience the stress of a rapidly accelerating life \u2013 \nwhere technologies that promised to ameliorate the tensions of a busy world, simply \nenable ever-more frenetic and multiscalar patterns of activity, coordination and multi-\ntasking to be performed simultaneously, at greater and greater speeds, and  increasing \nlevels of complexity.   \n \nOpening Black Boxes: Doing Things with ICTs \n \nTurning to the second problem, there is a paucity of work in urban studies that examines \nwhat people do with ICTs. Thus, we tend to have a dichotomous understanding of ICTs \nand society where one is assumed to \u2018impact\u2019 on the other to varying degrees in abstract, \ngeneralised, and deterministic ways. Indeed, it is remarkable how quickly terms like ICTs \nand connectivity become linguistic \u2018black-boxes\u2019 that bundle together a whole assemblage \nof technologies and assume or imply a raft of resulting technologically-mediated social \npractices.  So, despite some excellent early work,  (e.g. Silverstone and Hirsch 1992), \nurban analyses rarely attend to how new technologies are configured and \u2018domesticated\u2019, \nin everyday practice, as means of re-making the time-space fabrics, and the logistical \ndynamics, of everyday urban life. This is partly because \u2018very little work has been done at \nthe local scale\u2019 (Crampton 2003, 19).  \n \nOutwith urban studies, Human Computer Interaction (HCI) studies have successfully \nunpacked the over abstract and generalised terms used in the policy literature. Thus, \n7 \nmultiple technologies emerge here as being configured by people in their practical \nengagements in daily life. In terms of users, the implication is that we should not be \nthinking of singular elements but also the interaction of phones (landline and mobile) with \ncomputers, with embedded processors, with television (digital and analog). \nProblematically, however, the dominant notion of the urban digital divide has tended to rely \non simplistic notions of what is meant by \u2018ICTs\u2019. Very often, this term is equated purely with \nInternet computers (Selwyn 2004, 346). Only very rarely have researchers explored the \nways in which multiple forms of technology are enrolled simultaneously and in parallel to \nsupport shifts in the time-space and logistical dynamics of urban life. Consequently, there \nis very little research thus far which explores how mobile phones, landline phones, internet \ncomputers and digital TV systems are being used together, as combined and \ninterconnected systems, to support changing practices and patterns of urban everyday life. \n \nThe need to focus on the interactions of multiple technologies and forms of access is \nthrown into relief by the example of mobile workers who may well be thus using multiple \nICT technologies to turn transit or leisure spaces into work space. Thus, intricate \u2018juggling\u2019 \namongst multiple uses of different technologies may be needed to make such continuous \nonline mobility a possibility. The dance of people and technologies occurs in detail as \nthings are made into workable solutions -- not pristine or optimal technical specifications -- \nby user practices (Brown and O'Hara 2003). Despite all the accounts of speed and the \nideologies of \u2018wireless\u2019 worlds and ubiquitous computing, anyone with personal experience \nof ICT use knows that the connecting of various devices is often a suboptimal \u2018kludge\u2019 \ndriven by \u2018good enough\u2019 technical fixes, user preferences and needs (Mackenzie 2005).  \n \nThe example of mobile phones throws light on this reconfiguration of practice and \ntechnology. Mobile phones, like satellite or cable TV, rarely figure in discussion of digital \n8 \nconnectivity. Yet they are intricately bound into people\u2019s lives, and have rather different \npatterns of \u2018access\u2019 than the internet. Text messaging is an almost paradigmatic example \nof unintended uses, developing from a facility originally intended for network engineers \n(Agar 2004). The mobile phone is not used in the same way as a landline \u2013 despite its \nfunctional similarities. Instead, mobiles have been endowed variously with more \n\u2018personality\u2019, being treated as a friend or fashion item, different and shifting amounts of \nsocial status, being connected to and incorporated into other ICTs, and, increasingly, \nembodying different communication technologies in themselves (with text, visual, video, \nweb browsing as well as audio). Work on mobile phones for instance would suggest taking \nseriously the spatial transformations enabled in using these artefacts. In its use a mobile \nmoves from vital work tool, to technology of reassurance often bought for \u2018safety\u2019, \nreassuring carers about contact with roaming youngsters while sometimes ending up \nresented by those bearers as a tool of surveillance. Yet, within people\u2019s lives, the mobile \nalso becomes an essential urban navigational tool (Townsend 2000, page 88; Laurier \n2001), allowing meetings of all kinds to be flexibly negotiated in time and space (Jain \n2002). As such mobiles involves and transform older technologies that manage \u2018presence \navailability\u2019 (Green 2002), transforming the boundaries of public and private interaction and \nreappropriating marginalised spaces in the city for work and leisure. What this highlights is \nthat ICTs are practiced and put to use in multiple ways in configurations with other \ntechnologies, spaces and domains of physical interaction and mobility.  \n \nWhile there is a rich ethno-methodological tradition looking at \u2018doing communication\u2019 this \nwork tends to shy away from addressing the broader consequences of such practices. \nICTs are neither coherent and discrete objects nor are they \u2018ends in themselves\u2019. Using \nthem requires competences and represents an accomplishment, but one which is often \nabout accomplishing something other than the intrinsic satisfaction of getting a network to \n9 \nwork. So, we need to think how various ICT artefacts and practices link into and enable \nchanges in the orchestration of everyday life (Crang, Crosbie et al. 2006). Whilst there is \nan emerging body of work on household technologies and ICTs, we remain largely \nuninformed about what the proliferation of ICT-mediated relationships  means for \nneighbourhoods and place-based communities (Little 2000; Bridge and Giullari 2004). \n \nCollective Mediations of ICT Use \n \nReturning to our third problem with urban digital divide literatures, such work has, thus far, \nbeen almost completely pre-occupied with use of ICTs by individual people or households. \nSurvey research on urban digital divides has concentrated overwhelmingly on apparently \nindividualised ICT users and functions (eg National Telecommunications and Information \nAdministration 1999; 2000; 2002). With some notable exceptions (e.g. Morley, 2000, \nHampton and Wellman, 2002), it is widely assumed within such surveys that ICTs are \nused by individuals or discrete household units with little regard to the collective logistical \nand time -space dynamics of their work, home, or social lives.  \n \nSuch a perspective ignores the ways in which collective and social relationships and \nnetworks, grounded within households, neighbourhoods and cities, help to mediate how \nICTs are domesticated, shaped, and used. It also ignores how ICT access and feedback \nshaping use are mediated collectively in places. Put simply email access, for example, is \npointless if you have nothing suitable to say or no one with whom communicating that \nmaterial would be meaningful or useful. As a practice, as much as individual choice, e-mail \nuse depends on others existing in a social network being available and responsive. \n \nThe Approach and Structure of this Paper \n10 \n \nTo address these three research gaps, this paper focuses on the ensemble of information \ntechnologies and practices, grounded in everyday social lives, that together are shaped to \nsupport varied reconfigurations in the logistics of everyday urban life. The result, we argue, \nis the emergence of  a \u2018multispeed urbanism\u2019 which structures urban digital divides based \non communities\u2019 varying abilities to hook up to multiscale and increasingly normalised  \nelectronic flows  -- and the urban restructuring dynamics  that are increasingly derived \nfrom them. Our focus here thus falls on the different ways  in which multiple ICTs are \nunevenly reconfiguring the logistical time-space practices of everyday urban life at the \nlevel of broadly \u2018included\u2019 and \u2018excluded\u2019 neighbourhoods within cities. We do not just \nattend to \u2018online division\u2019 as an indicator of exclusion. Rather, we are concerned with the \nways in which uneven geographies of ICT mediation within cities may function, or be \nperformed, as an engine of exclusion and the oft-trumpeted possibilities offered for greater \ninclusion. We therefore agree with Bromley\u2019s (2004) stress on the fundamental social \nconsequences of ICTs, though not the solely positive outcomes. She points out, in \nparticular, that:  \n\u2018the internet \u2026 is a portal which has the potential to liberalise access to a \nwhole host of resources and opportunities, and to increase social \nconnections. ... It has the capacity to impart knowledge to groups which \nhave tended to be excluded from traditional information sources, to provide \nnew channels of communication, and to open up access to goods and \nservices previously denied or impeded by older technologies or methods of \nexchange.\u2019 (2004, 73)  \n \n11 \nWe would add that, as Internet use becomes normalised in daily routines, those without \naccess may find access and services previously supplied otherwise becoming more \ninaccessible.  \n \nThe discussion that follows falls into two parts. As a means of laying the conceptual \nfoundations for the following analysis, we begin with a brief theoretical discussion. This \naddresses two key conceptual problems:  first, how geographies of multispeed urbanism \nmight be imagined, and, second, how urban digital divides might be affected by the alleged \nspeeding-up of urban living and the space-time configurations of cities that result from ICT \nuse. The second part of the paper then outlines findings from a detailed case study of the \nways in which ICTs are being enrolled to reconfigure the logistics and time-spaces of urban \neveryday life in two highly contrasting neighbourhoods within one city: Newcastle-upon-\nTyne in the UK. The case study addresses how the differentials of demographics, social \ncapital and neighbourhood social organisation inflect the use of ICTs in practice in the two \nneighbourhoods. This analysis highlights two themes in particular. First, rather than \npresence or absence of technologies, it emphasises more fluid urban digital divides \nconstituted through varying time-space rhythms of ICT use. Here, a pervasive, ubiquitous \npresence is seen to exist amongst more affluent and included users which contrasts sharply \nwith more episodic and instrumental usage of ICTs amongst less affluent ones. Second, this \nsection looks at a blurring of access patterns through locally embedded, socialised use, \nwhich appears to be especially important amongst marginalised neighbourhoods associated \nwith episodic styles of ICT use.  \n \nImagining Multispeed Urban Landscapes \n \n12 \nThe preceding critique and reconceptualisation of notions of urban digital divides, based \non the central importance of the interplay of ICTs, time-space and the dynamic processes \nof urban everyday life, raises a key question: how might we imagine the social and \ngeographical landscapes of urban digital divides within cities characterised by multispeed \nurbanism?   \n \nMutispeed Cities as \u2018Tame\u2019 and \u2018Wild\u2019 Zones? \n \nScott Lash\u2019s (2002) work offers a provocative lead here. He contrasts what he calls the \n\u2018live\u2019 and \u2018dead zones\u2019 of cities defined by the presence (or relative absence) of the flows \nof information within such \u2018zones\u2019 (pages 28-9). This he pairs with responses to such \ninformation, referring to a parallel urban geography of what he calls \u2018tame\u2019 and \u2018wild\u2019 \nzones. Thus, Lash produces a four-way typology. Dead\/Tame zones are characterized by \nmajoritarian ethnic groups clinging to traditionalist values in the face of change. Live\/Tame \nzones are dominated by the \u2018informational bourgeoisie\u2019, with affluent connected \npopulations doing comfortably, and thus relatively conservative, as regards the social \norder. Live\/Wild zones are marked by the emergence of new cultural forms driven by the \n\u2018cultural capital faction of the post\u2014industrial middle class\u2019. Finally, Dead\/Wild zones are \nareas of social decomposition, characterized by marginal groups, cultural change and \nfluidity. Such a schema addresses not just uneven informational landscapes within cities; it \nalso highlights that intra-urban social geographies and the informational environment \ninteract. Informational environments are thus seen to affect neighbourhoods, which \nreciprocally affect how that information may be accessed and used. \n \nLash\u2019s typology, however, is both dualistic and freighted with valorizations that privilege \nthe \u2018wild\u2019 where even the urban information \u2018have-nots\u2019  are exciting, and \u2018cultural \n13 \ncreatives\u2019 drive innovative urbanism (see for instance Pratt 2002). This loading of the dice, \nespecially for the live\/wild zone, suggests that we have something of a fashioning of a self-\nimage or, at least, fantasy identity for information professionals. Such an argument has led \nFrank Webster to voice: \n\u2018an uneasy suspicion that many commentators, from academe, business, \npolitics and media, in effect write themselves on to the city today. That is, \nmuch of the writing of the \u2018new urbanism\u2019, about the city\u2019s dynamism, its \nflexibility, its stimulation, is diversity, its computer communications \ntechnologies, its style, its cosmopolitanism, its cultures, seems to be, well, \nour story. We are indisputably part of the knowledge \u00b4elite, and we tell our \nown favoured tale as regards the city of the future\u2019 (2001, 42). \n \nWhile such reflexive understandings of an urban \u2018information revolution\u2019 are vital to our \nanalysis, we do not want to be seduced by a walk on the wild side. We wish to know what \n\u2018taming\u2019 such technologies is all about within the context of urban digital divides. \n \nMultispeed Cities and the Uneven Acceleration of Urban Everyday Lives \n \nIf we look at information \u2018haves\u2019, we see a picture, or at least a self-image, of accelerating \nlives. Here information technology is offered as a solution to managing a \u201824\/7\u2019 lifestyle (for \nthe \u2018wild\u2019), or the competing time demands of work, family and self (for the \u2018tame\u2019). In \nessence then, far from a fantasy of speed, many of the \u2018hyper-connected\u2019 in the latter \ncamp may well experience a stressful and debilitating time-squeeze as the logistical \ndemands of intensification and speed-up become increasingly problematic (Eriksen 2001).  \n \n14 \nStories of acceleration and squeezing more activities into the day are a key part of the \nimaginary of the digitisation of urban life. The flipside is that speeded-up lives, \norchestrated by suites of always-on ICTs, entail double and triple-shifting women and \nenable long hours by over-achieving men in informational sectors (Perrons 2003).  \n \nOn the one hand, then, ICTs are apparently adopted as a time-saving technology in the \nface of mounting pressures. So a variety of communication media are now sold as a \ncollective ensemble of systems and infrastructures which together allow more activities to \nbe crammed in lifestyles characterised increasingly by multi-tasking, always-on \nconnectivities, the continuous interactions of multiple scales, and fluid coordination. On the \nother, empirical analysis suggests that \u2018free\u2019 time is generally growing although many with \ndiverse home and work activities competing for time feel \u2018busyness\u2019 as a pressure \n(Gershuny 2000, 2002). Moreover various technologies have not simply freed up time \npreviously spent on chores \u2013 more often they reallocate that time within a household or \neven expand chores, by increasing frequencies of activities (for a debate see Bittman, \nRice et al. 2004; Gershuny 2004).  \n \nFor digital media there has been debate about time online displacing other (\u201creal\u201d) social \nactivities \u2013 with accounts portraying alienated net users, where as Mitchell pithily put it: \n\u2018they picture us all huddled at home in our underwear typing email messages to one \nanother\u2019 (1999, page 91). As Gershuny (2003) points out, the \u2018real\u2019 versus mediated \ninteraction literature assumes that online and media time is a \u2018final activity\u2019 that is \nsubstituted for others. However, rather than simply being a goal in themselves, activities \nmediated through ICTs -- such as e-shopping,  contacting people or information searching \n-- often enable or orchestrate other \u2018offline\u2019 activities and goals. Much early research \nfocused upon enthusiastic early adopters, who also indeed liked to see themselves as \n15 \nharbingers of change. Now with widespread adoption, and mass diffusion, we can focus \nrather more upon the \u2018quiet pragmatists\u2019 who form a majority using the technology \nconservatively and whose \u2018motivation for using technology is dominated by everyday \nconcerns\u2019 (Crabtree, Nathan et al. 2002, page 3, 26-8). \n \nFour important points emerge here. First, ICTs may -- but only may \u2013 facilitate quicker \nconnectivity, communications or transactions than traditional physical access \u2013 either by \ndesign, as a privilege of mediated access (effectively a \u2018bypass\u2019 or queue jumping, see \nGraham, 2005), or unintentionally (if, for instance, an e-shop discourages product \nbrowsing, purchases may be more \u2018efficient\u2019).  \n \nSecond, ICTs enable timeshifting activities to formerly unavailable time slots as the rigid \ntime-space routines of traditional face-to-face work and urban consumption within mass, \nindustrialised, cities, give way to flexible and complex orchestrations involving \ngeographically distanced access combined with continuous temporal opportunities for \nengagement. Thus, online grocery shopping or phone banking may be no quicker at all. \nBut, if they can be done in the evening, they may fit around other more valued or \nconstrained tasks \u2013 such as work hours, child care, or so forth. All these outcomes are \ncontingent -- phone banking may beat travelling to the bank and physical queuing, or being \nplaced in a phone queue preference system may not be any advantage. Equally, online \nbanking may be faster than both or getting access on a secure PC, starting it, getting a \nconnection and processing may be just as slow.  \n \nThird, more than just time use constraints, ICT mediations also enable the relocating of \nsome \u2013 but only some \u2013 activities within, through, and beyond, the material spaces of \ncities. Thus, both phone and online banking do spatially relocate tasks and thus reduce \n16 \ntravel time and may allow multitasking whilst doing banking, but being able to tell childcare \nproviders on your mobile phone that you will be late does not make you get there quicker \n(Jarvis 2005).  \n \nFinally, mobilised devices can enable users to convert formerly \u2018dead\u2019 space(-time) -- such \nas the bus stop, or indeed the bus -- to connect with people not physically present. Thus, \nmultitasking is moved out of the home, facilitating complex processes through which \nelectronic and physical roaming within and between cities are continuously recombined in \nnew ways.  \n \nThese latter two points exemplify the possibilities of the intensified use of time through \nICTs -- not simply moving it around within a fixed time budget. This complex pattern may \nstart to explain mixed effects where analyses suggest that \u2018each extra minute on the \nInternet is associated with about one-third of a minute reduction in personal care time, one \nfifth of a minute less visiting, half a minute less watching television ..[and], nearly one-fifth \nof a minute of extra time devoted to going out \u2014 eating or drinking in a public place, going \nto the theater or cinema\u2019 (Gershuny 2003, 158, 164). Longitudinal measurement of \nchanges in time use by people adopting ICT technologies actually suggests an even \nstronger positive relationship with socializing and specifically with going out to public \nplaces. Time-use figures also suggest that people with home web access tend to work \nlonger hours and sleep for fewer, though there is no simple causal inference here. This \nhighlights that while, so far, we have couched this changing online and communication \ntime pattern in terms of consumption, when looking at the \u2018hyper-connected\u2019 who are often \nbound up in the transnational informational economy at work, what we also have is the de-\nlocalisation of work and its relocation into the home \u2013 as out of hours, weekend work and \nso forth. Thus, \u2018creative work\u2019 often involves periods of intense, and not entirely \n17 \npredictable, activity, tied into the dynamics of transnational urban networks. But these \nperiods can be followed by periods of slack time. Thus, \u2018creative\u2019 workers work flexible \nhours in order to deal with volume and rhythm of work (Perrons 2003, 70, 84).  \n \nExploring Multispeed Urbanism: A Case Study of Newcastle upon Tyne \n \nIn what follows we seek to build on the above theoretical and conceptual discussions about \nthe connections between urban inequalities, ICTs and the changing logistics of everyday life \nthrough a detailed case study of two neighbourhoods in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. This enables \nus to focus on the varied ways in which affluent and marginalised users are using ICTs to \nreshape the logistics of daily life within one city. Newcastle was selected as the subject of \nresearch for two reasons. First, at a regional scale, the North East of England is one of the \nUK\u2019s \u2018lagging regions\u2019 in terms of ICT adoption. In 2003-4, for example, the region had the \nlowest rates of net usage in the UK (43% as against London\u2019s 64%) and the lowest rates of \nhome Internet access in England (41% as against London\u2019s 56%) (Office of National \nStatistics (ONS) household and omnibus surveys). However, regions are poor reflectors of \nvarying rates of ICT access within cities.  \n \nSecond, then, Newcastle offers contrasts where neighbourhoods might share public and \nprivate urban services but be worlds apart in terms the dynamics of multispeed urbanism, \nas stark variations of income, social class, levels of digital inclusion or exclusion, and the \ntime-space dynamics of ICT-mediated urban life, played out differently across the City\u2019s \naffluent and more marginalised neighbourhoods.  \n \n18 \nWithin the city we selected two highly contrasting neighbourhoods for study which are \nbarely a mile apart geographically: Blakelaw and Jesmond. Blakelaw is in the bottom 20% \nwards on the UK Government\u2019s index of social deprivation; Jesmond is among the \nwealthiest 20%. Nationally, home internet access in the UK varies from around 85% for the \nwealthiest quintile down to 15% for the poorest quintile (ONS 2003-04). This  gap, \nmoreover, is widening in both the UK and the US (Bromley 2004, 78; National \nTelecommunications and Information Administration 2002). The two wards were thus \nselected because they presented remarkably differing profiles on a range of variables that \nmight be expected to lead to widely disparate patterns of ICT adoption, the organisation of \ndaily life, and utilisation of ICTs (see Table 1). Methodologically, each ward was subject to a \nstratified postal survey (n=400) to establish baseline levels of ICT usage. This was followed \nby in-depth interviews with 50 respondents in each ward, and a similar number of \ntechnology-use diaries to try and track not just what people said but what they did, when, \nwhere and how often. All interviews were recorded and transcribed, then coded following an \nabductive approach, building inferentially on patterns in the material using NUD*IST \nqualitative analysis software (see Crang 1997, 2003). \n \nTABLE 1 AROUND HERE \n \nBlakelaw and Jesmond offer something of the contrast between the \u2018live\u2019(tame) and \n\u2018dead\u2019(tame) informational zones that Lash outlined. Blakelaw has a history as a dormitory \nneighbourhood for working class, manufacturing employees; Jesmond, meanwhile, is and \nhas been a professional enclave oriented towards the information economy \u2013 but generally \nthe \u2018safer\u2019 public sector and corporate jobs. The income profiles would lead us to expect \nvarying adoption rates for ICTs and, indeed, 60% of our respondents from Jesmond but \nonly 37% from Blakelaw had internet access at home (Table 2), a smaller gap than socio-\n19 \neconomic statistics would suggest. Despite stark income differentials, the digital divide was \nmore complex, with a relative similarity in Broadband rates explained by its bundling with \ncable TV by the local service provider - and cable TV does not follow the same socio-\neconomic profile as the Internet. So, for our neighbourhoods, the key factor in \u2018bandwidth\u2019 \nwas not income but rather supply-side combinations of ICTs. But households with access \nto cable connectivity did not always use online services the most, and virtually no one \nused digital TV itself as the means to access the Internet.  \n \nTABLE 2 AROUND HERE \n \nThis pattern of access suggests that rising income is a significant, but far from exhaustive, \npredictor of Internet usage. In our sample (Table 3), 16.7% of all respondents in Blakelaw \n(i.e. 26% of non users) and 3.6% in Jesmond (9% of nonusers) cited cost as a reason for \nnot using the \u2018net -- a stronger income effect on choice than national data predicts. As far \nas the often-conjectured lack of social capital and skills as \u2018barriers to diffusion\u2019, only 3.3% \nof Blakelaw respondents (5% of non adopters) and a surprisingly larger 11.8% of Jesmond \nrespondents (30% of non adopters) cited knowledge barriers. This flips the expectations of \nprogrammes which concentrate training initiatives on poorer wards as an alleged solution \nto urban digital divides. Such data accords with studies which suggest people are making \npragmatic and relatively informed judgements about the use and value to them that \nparticular ICTs will have (Crabtree, Nathan et al. 2002) \n \nTABLE 3 AROUND HERE \n \nUrban Digital Divides as Process; \nContrasts Between Pervasive and Episodic ICT Use \n20 \n \nOur key analytic issue of was not the physical presence of absence of ICTs, but how ICT \nuse varied between the two neighbourhood samples (Selwyn 2004, 347-8). In terms of \nlooking up information, the proportions for the neighbourhoods followed the pattern of \naccess, but around double the proportion from Jesmond (45%) used digital media for \nregular communication. Communicability, not information, tends to support feelings of \nsocial inclusion and quality of life (Anderson 2002). Several of our interview respondents \nargued that online access to information told them little they could not already find out -  \nthough more quickly and generally while staying at home. If we focus upon the \norchestration of daily living, rather than information transmission, then patterns of usage \nwere more skewed than access, with 16% of respondents from Blakelaw using internet \nbanking, 10% paying bills online and 28% of respondents using internet shopping as \nopposed to 26% of the respondents from Jesmond using banking, 16% paying bills and \n40% shopping online. If ICTs are enabling the acceleration of urban life, that acceleration \nwas doubly concentrated among the connected. \n \nAs we explored patterns of usage, key issues emerged around the mode of ICT use and \nhow these related to the broader logistics of everyday urban life between the two samples. \nIt quickly became clear that \u2018conditions of inclusion and marginalization could not be \ntreated as an \u201ceither\u2013or\u201d state\u2019 (Beck, Madon et al. 2004, 280). As Bromley (2004, 93) has \nsuggested in the case of national UK data: \n\u2018Certain patterns start to become familiar: younger people, those with \ndegrees, and high household incomes are more likely to make extensive use \nof the internet than are older internet users or those with fewer educational or \neconomic resources (whose use tends to be restricted to just one or two \n21 \ndifferent applications). It is therefore perhaps more apposite to talk of digital \ndivides rather than simply referring to it as a singular phenomenon.\u2019  \n \nThe pattern was of multiple social factors but also how extensive was people\u2019s use. \nNationally, across the UK, 28% of personal users accessed the net at least once a day, \n27% \u2018several times a week\u2019, 16% once or twice a week, 14% up to once a week and 16% \nonce a month (ONS 2003). If we look at personal ICT time-use, rather than the physical \naccess, we find men \u2018in higher professional and managerial occupations spend 4 hours \nper week in computer-related activities and similarly placed women, 3 hours per week. \nThose in manual occupations spend hardly 1 hour per week in these activities\u2019 (Gershuny \n2003, 153). Our sample suggested how profound a difference this pattern of use makes, \nas the effects of ICTs cascade into other activities. The divide in use we found was not \naccess per se but a pattern of pervasive use amongst affluent residents in Jesmond \ncontrasted with cultures of episodic ICT use amongst the more marginalized residents of \nBlakelaw.  \n \nOur study suggested the existence of two distinct modes of ICT use: discrete, episodic ICT \nuse \u2013 mostly for instrumental and specific reasons -- and a more constant style of \npervasive ICT use.  For pervasive users in our study \u2013 predominantly affluent and time-\npressured professionals living in Jesmond -- various ICTs worked together to permeate, \nand continually orchestrate, their everyday lives. ICTs, in other words, become a taken for \ngranted and always-on \u2018infrastructure\u2019 \u2013 a background assemblage of technologies and \npractices sustaining continuous multi-tasking involving many geographical scales of \ndistanciated connection simultaneously.  \n \n22 \nTelephones were seen to be the most vital technology for modern life by both sets of \nrespondents \u2013 though often mobile phones rather than landlines. This varied by area, \nthough, with 45% in Jesmond feeling the phone was \u201cessential\u201d to their lives as against \n25% in Blakelaw. How they became essential and what that actually means we shall see \nbelow. The mean use of land line telephone between the neighbourhoods was not \nstatistically different -- in both areas two thirds of people used their land lines for less than \n3 hours per week. It was notable, however, that the heavy users making 3-6 hours of calls \na week were much more pronounced in Jesmond (34.2% of all users as against 18.7% in \nBlakelaw). There was a positive correlation of usage with income in Blakelaw, but not in \nJesmond \u2013 suggesting an income threshold beyond which there is no further effect. \nHowever, within Jesmond 15% had more than one \u2018phone line, while in Blakelaw only 5% \ndid \u2013and the most frequent reason given for multiple lines was to facilitate dial-up Internet \naccess.  \n \nThe second largest use of home telephones in Jesmond was communicating with work, \nwith 7% using phones more to communicate with work than friends and family, while \nJesmond respondents were also more likely to use phone connections to arrange \nfinances, utilities and services. The dependence on pervasive access to mobile \nconnections in Jesmond came through strongly in interviews where one user spent 10% of \nher interview narrating the gradual move of her mobile phone from a tool with a specific, \nlimited purpose where uses were clearly demarcated, to a situation where it became an \nintrinsic and habitual component of the logistics of living \u2013 a background infrastructure \norchestrating everything she did: \nR: I suppose it\u2019s always like this, you get [a mobile phone] thinking 'well I'll \nhave it for an emergency' and then you end up being one of those people \nstanding at Tesco's saying 'they don't have fresh broad beans, do you want \n23 \nrunner beans instead?' So I think what a sad soul I've turned into.  But you \ncan get that instant hit. [\u2026] its that kind of, I don't know, it just takes all the \nlittle wrinkles out of your life, you don't have to wait.  You know, 'I need to \nconsult you, is it OK' 'Yes it is fine' 'Oh that's marvellous' and it can happen \nand I think that's great so I've become one of those people who would never \never want to give up a mobile. (Interview 17, Jesmond). \n \nThis passage shows the gradual embedding of a technology, until it becomes essential for \ndaily living, and both a purveyor and solution to discourses that demand instantaneity and \nthe ability to orchestrate daily living for people moving through the city separately but \ninterdependently. How ICTs pervade activities became clear in the time diaries of several \nJesmond respondents who were unable to indicate when they used ICTs \u2013 because they \nwere unable to indicate when, if ever, they did not. Thus, one Jesmond respondent simply \ndrew lines all the way across the day in her time-diary to indicate constant use of phone \nand email. In the free entry sections she wrote \u2018Constant emailing\u2019, \u2018Constant [internet \naccess] at work\u2019, \u2018E-mails all day\u2019. This person was not solely emailing all day, but there \nwere no prolonged spells when she was not connected and in that sense the task of \n\u2018doing\u2019 email became continuously woven into her work.  \n \nCompare this with an episodic ICT user who worked with computers quite extensively and \nrecorded a lot of communication activity in their diary, but who could record specific timed \nevents: \u20189.10 : 3 work e-mails sent to colleagues\u2019, or:  2pm \u2018Check e-mails - receive 5 work \ntasks send 3 replies further 2 work\u2019. We found these episodic users to be much more \nprevalent in Blakelaw than in Jesmond. Episodic users were able to demarcate quite \nprecisely the times and spaces of ICT usage from the times and spaces of non-use. They \n24 \nwere also able to recall the specific reason for the shift from non-use to use and back \nagain to non-use. Take, for example, the discussion with Interviewee 1 from Blakelaw: \nI: Will you use the email?  \nR: I've used the email. \nI: Who do you email? \nR: Well I've emailed me family and friends.  Oh, I booked me holiday, I've \nbooked me holiday with [partner] last week on the internet.  I did that, and \nthat came through fine.  [\u2026] \nI: How important, would you say, is the email and the Internet for organizing \nyour daily routine?   \nR: Oh no, not really, not for organizing me daily routine.  But for the odd \noccasion when you want something done, it\u2019s come up trumps for me.  \n \nThe respondent, with broadband access and a household income between \u00a316-20,000, \ndownplays the Internet\u2019s role in organising their daily life. But she recounts specific \noccasions when she gained benefits from individual ICT-mediated transactions. To \nepisodic users, based overwhelmingly in Blakelaw, moments of ICT use thus remained \nnotable and still carried a sense of being novel and separate from the wider background of \na non-ICT enabled everyday life. \n \nContrast this with the effects noted by interviewee 17 from Jesmond, who prefers a mobile \nphone to email because she can turn it off or leave it in her bag while email is for her a \nconstant, and demanding, presence: \nR: No because you've always got the freedom to switch [the mobile] off...  \nwhen I haven't got it its because I've extracted myself or I've turned it off so I \ndon't feel I'm kind of on a chain, whereas I actually do with email. \n25 \nI: Oh you do with email?  \nR: Oh yes,  because I think its addictive and you think, I know the... of \ncourse the thing is now I've got speakers, it goes 'bing bong' and I  think I \nshould turn them down because every time there's a 'bing' I go and see \nwhat it is. \nI: You can switch the 'bing bong' off. \nR: Yes, I know, yes I have, I thought I must do this because, I just feel, its \nlike being a dog on a lead, you sort of get hooked into it, I know you, the \nidea of email is that people send you a message when its convenient or \nmaterial, you look at it when its convenient to you, but I think increasingly \nthat's not the case.  You feel almost obliged to make instant response and if \nyou neglect your emails and you go into them, and there's like, you know, \ntwo hundred and ten...\u2019  \n \nHere, the hyper-connected, pervasive ICT user from Jesmond (occupationally one of the \n\u2018informational workers\u2019, with a household income over \u00a360,000, who banks online, shops \nonline and has broadband access) experiences ICTs not just as a solution to time-\npressure and life speed-up, but as a cause of the problem. Indeed, in her interview, she \nvalued the ability to disconnect, to \u2018extract herself\u2019, something she found hard to do even \non evenings or on holiday as pervasive ICT use blurred the divisions between connected \nand non-connected spaces and times. If we look at her account in detail, we have to think \nthat this technically connected person has not disabled the email alert, but instead \narticulates a sense of obligation about the messages \u2013 that they demand a speedy reply, \nthere is an expectation and possibly sanctions for failure. Here we see articulated the \nnotion of acceleration, but bound to a technology that is usually referred to as \n\u2018asynchronous\u2019 messaging. The synchronous real time conversation by telephone can by \n26 \ncontrast be avoided and disconnected, whereas email is felt as \u2018chain\u2019. Thus, this \nrespondent can be unavailable for real time communication but email accumulates with a \nsort of awful inescapability. So she feels a shifting pressure from something that should \nenable her to choose when to read the messages to something demanding a response \u2013 a \ndemand for immediacy that she finds in the expectations of senders. So these different \nICTs are brought into her life in different ways offering her different amounts of control that \nare not determined by the technology itself. Many other examples of ICTs creating time-\nstress were found among the Jesmond sample, with interviewee 35, for example, arguing \nthat:  \n\u2018there's a need to look at the clear downsides [of pervasive ICT use], I think \nit can be incredibly stressful, intrusive, I've heard other people say that their \nheart sinks, they're constantly trying to manage an inbox of emails, and this \nisn't just the \u2018spam\u2019 stuff this is the simple demands of work. ... there is \nsimply too much information that comes through which I do think has an \ninfluence on people \u2026There are countless ways in which it can be a source \nof stress, and I've heard many other people say that\u2019.  \n \nThis interviewee is not just stating their experience here but reproducing a popular \ndiscourse and reflexive self-understanding about information overload and the stresses of \naccelerating everyday life caused by pervasive ICT use. \u2018Many other people\u2019 are talking \nabout this \u2018busyness\u2019. And yet, the broader empirical data suggest that work time is not \nexpanding. So here we may be seeing an intensification of work within a given time, the \nproduction of new work (having to \u2018manage an inbox\u2019) or the social valorisation of \n\u2018busyness\u2019 as a badge of honour, a statement of importance and value for elite workers \n(Gershuny 2005). Notably, and in sharp contrast to the focus amongst episodic users on \nisolated moments of connectivity, these pervasive users\u2019 stories highlighted moments of \n27 \ndisconnection from ICT use as aberrant and remarkable. Moreover, different \ncommunicative media \u2013 from texting to emailing, to \u2018phoning \u2013 were portrayed by such \nusers as part of an overall ecology, with different strategies for each, but nevertheless all \nforming a communicative assemblage in which multiple systems are used together to \nsustain multiple, simultaneous, and continuous tasks. There is, then, a difference in \nstrategies of use and outcome despite similar technical accomplishments. Thus, the dense \ninterweaving of online and offline activities among the highly connected, where patterns of \ntexting quick messages bleed through to email, where physical shopping and online \nordering for convenience, orchestrating friends gathering via email circulars forms this \npervasive infrastructure -- that is a qualitatively different experience from arranging to log \non and getting a good deal for one isolated transaction through a comparison shopping \nweb site.  \n \nEpisodic ICT Access: The Importance of  \nNeighbourhood and Social Mediation  \n \nIf traditional access data derived from household surveys seems to underplay the effects \nof the digital divide on the one hand, they also tend to overstate urban digital divides as a \nstructural binary simply dividing urban societies into two parts. This portrayal actually \nmisses a large amount of ICT usage. Our study suggests in particular that episodic users \ntend to be under-reported in studies based on access, and their neighbourhoods thus not \nso \u2018dead\u2019 to digital flows. Most digital divide and household ICT access surveys, to be \ncomparable to national data, ask questions on personal ICT use in the previous three \nmonths. Evidence from the ONS and our other methods suggests that this does not give a \nfull picture. In several interviews, when asked about e-commerce, respondents would say \nthat they had not used ICTs. However, further into the interview, they would suddenly \n28 \nrecall how they had bought something online through another person. Had we simply \nconducted a questionnaire then they might never have recalled their indirect and \ncollectively mediated ICT access and thus we would have simply labelled such people as \ndigitally excluded non-users. This concurs with ONS surveys of non-use of the Internet \nwhich introduced a new category in 2003 \u2018someone else uses the net for me\u2019 which \ncomprised 10-15% of non-users, and in the ONS omnibus survey for 2003-04, 25% of \nusers had accessed internet at someone else\u2019s house, while British Social Attitudes data \nsuggests 15% do so (Bromley 2004).  \n \nIn our survey 9% of respondents from Blakelaw and 8% from Jesmond had accessed the \ninternet from friends\u2019 houses. This pattern and proxy access makes us conclude that \nsurveys asking about physical Internet points of presence may well underestimate the \ninfiltration of that media. Interviews repeatedly found the benefits of cheap e-commerce \nprovision, especially of travel purchases, spread much further than hardware provision \nsuggests. Take, for example, Interview 15 (Jesmond): \nI: [have you shopped on the Internet?] \nR: Me personally, no. Well you see my children will use it for me in that if, for \nexample, one of them will ring up and say 'I've found you a cheap holiday \nmum' or I'll ring them and say, because we go over to France a lot, and I'll \nsay 'I'm looking for a cheap crossing', 'Oh leave it with me mum I'll find you \none'.  And em, they do it for me. \n \nUsing other\u2019s knowledge of good deals and products through social networks is nothing \nnew, and can be found in shopping practices from markets to department stores. But it \nemphasises that, far from a purely individual practice amongst atomised people or \nhouseholds, here e-commerce emerges as a social affair. These episodic users tend to \n29 \nfocus on discrete high value transactions, where there is a clear financial benefit and \nstandard product. The standard product means that these can be delegated purchases. So \nbelow we see a respondent from  Blakelaw (Interview 1), who started by saying that they \ndid not shop on the Internet. Through the course of the interview, however, the interviewee \nkept recalling instances where they had done so but through collaboration: \nR:\u2026 I don't think I'll use it for shopping.  I don't think I will.  But saying that, \nfor any big items, I not saying I wouldn't do it for that, for a washing \nmachine for instance, for a television.  Well actually I have done it for a \ntelevision, the television up in my bedroom.  But, it was done, me niece \ndone it for us, she went onto Tesco\u2019s and done it and that.   \n \nThis is not some delocalised realm of e-commerce, but the embedding of ecommerce via \nlocal social networks. Nor were these examples of socialised e-commerce tenuous or \ninfrequent events. Often, they were widespread and quickly facilitated. In the excerpt \nbelow, the Blakelaw respondent ends up listing five separate people, all in the local \nneighbourhood, who shop online for her: \nI: Do you use the internet at all? \nR: No, em, I don't go on it personally, but if I need to know anything my \ndaughter or my son, they get it up, because they just live within a few \nminutes, and I just phone them, they sort things out for me over the internet.  \nIf I want a railway ticket or something like that, because sometimes when you \ngo on the internet you get deals, you know.  [\u2026] I don't need to, because as I \nsay I've got my son or my daughter,  you know, who've got them. Actually my \nsister's have all got them, well two of my sister's. [\u2026] one of them, she just \nlives up the  road. And [another resident] she's got a computer and they're on \nthe internet as well. (Interview 12). \n30 \n \nWhat this suggests is less an absolute divide of access between ICT users and non-users \nseparated out amongst the various zones of polarised urban landscapes, and more a set \nof digital divides marked by contrasts in time-space modes of ICT use. We found people \nwithout \u2018access\u2019 in conventional measures, who, whilst not able to use the \u2018net themselves, \nwere nonetheless able, via telephone in the above excerpt, to exploit existing offline, local \nsocial networks to indirectly access the benefits of online commerce. But, in the above \nquote, note how it is still remarked upon who does have a computer, and that this social \nnetwork while local is doubly mediated \u2013 her children live within a few minutes but she \nphones them to access the Internet for her. In Jesmond, this social access occurred very \nlargely within households with numerous respondents saying they did not shop or bank \nonline because their partner dealt with those things. In Blakelaw, however -- with its low \nresidential mobility and dense, stable, familial and neighbourhood networks \u2013 indirect, \nsocialised uses of ICTs often also extended beyond the household.  \n \nThese socialised contacts, moreover, appeared much more significant than \u2018public access\u2019 \nprovision in libraries or kiosks. UK national figures suggest that 8-9% of users access the \nInternet via internet caf\u00e9s and 7-10% via library or community centres (ONS National \nOmnibus survey 2004). However, in our sample, only some 4% of respondents from \nBlakelaw, and 12% of respondents from Jesmond, accessed the internet from internet \ncaf\u00e9s, and 7% of respondents from Blakelaw and 12% of respondents from Jesmond \naccess the internet from their local library. Despite the implementation of \u2018e-phones\u2019 and \nkiosks in Newcastle, we found only one respondent who had used them (and that was only \nonce). In other words, not only does the presence of these public facilities not appear to \nprovide meaningful access, they are slightly more likely to benefit the better off community \nwith the competences, expectations and incentives to use them when they available. \n31 \n \nHowever, our analysis suggests that socialised access at the neighbourhood level in \nBlakelaw is unable to provide all the benefits received through individual or household \nonline services. These networks are mobilised for specific tasks where there is an \noverriding financial benefit and a simple product. For poorer residents of Blakelaw, though, \nthere were limits to this process. Probing online banking and payment of bills \u2013 often \noffering preferential account rates \u2013 we found disproportionately less use in Blakelaw. \nOnline banking and utility accounts are linked to private access. In Blakelaw interviews, we \nalso found preferences for unmediated \u2018local provision\u2019 based on face to face physical \nbranch offices. Often, this provision was no more accessible in Blakelaw than it was in \nJesmond, yet physical access was felt as more empowering and direct by Blakelaw \nrespondents, where mediated access was often regarded with suspicion and as an \nobstacle, while Jesmond residents stressed digital services\u2019 convenience in terms of time \nof access, overcoming spatial distance and speed. The ideological connotations of the \nmedia and lack of access were thus almost directly opposite in the two areas of the study \n(see also Schofield-Clark et al 2004). \n \nConclusions \n \nOur evidence in this paper suggests that new imaginations of urban digital divides are \nurgently required. Moving away from a preoccupation with mapping the diffusion of \nphysical ICT access facilities within and between the geographies of cities, attention needs \nto shift, rather, to the ways in which varying modes of ICT use are constructed to unevenly \nreshape the times, spaces and logistics of everyday urban life between wealthier and less \nwealthy groups and areas in cities.  \n \n32 \nBy taking such an approach, this study has shown that the relationships between urban \ninequality and ICTs relate less and less to stark, binaried geographies of access or lack of \naccess. Rather, digital divides increasingly entail contrasts in modes, styles, temporalities, \nand intensities of ICT use. These imply that the ways in which ICTs are being unevenly \nused reshapes the temporal, spatial and logistical constraints that characterise urban \ninequalities, mediates individual and collective relationships in new ways, and requires \ncareful attention. On the one hand, then, our study suggests that affluent neighbourhoods \ntend to be associated with pervasive ICT use through which multiple ICTs systems are \nconfigured together as an \u2018always-on\u2019 and background infrastructure orchestrating \ncomplex and speeding-up logistical, home and work lives. Whilst certainly enrolling the \ncapacities of ICTs for relatively privileged and powerful users, the resultant \u2018time-crunch\u2019, \nand the proliferating interactions generated by need to coordinate ever more extended, \nmultiscalar and complex networks of tasks, tends to also result in an increasing sense of \nstress for users (Southerton 2003).  \n \nHere, ironically, the absence of ICTs is both feared and craved; ICTs become so \nnormalised as the transactional glue holding together everyday life that moments and \nspaces where they are not underpinning complex logistical negotiations actually become \nmost noticeable. There is, thus, a dialectical relationship between the orchestrational and \nliberating capacity of ICTs. For such technologies hold: \n\u2018the promise to help people cope with the compression and fragmentation of \ntime. But in so doing they lock their users into certain practices and habits, at \nthe same time requiring an extensive if routinely invisible supporting \ninfrastructure\u2019 with the 'unintended consequence of tying people into an ever \ndenser network of inter-dependent, perhaps even dependent, relationships \n33 \nwith the very things designed to free them from just such obligations' (Shove \nand Southerton 2000, 315).   \n \nMoreover, the organisational webs mediated through pervasive use of ICTs become more \nflexible, multiscaled and complex to manage when: \n\u2018by speeding things up, or offering increased flexibility, contemporary \ntechnologies, systems and infrastructures of mobility permit the \nfragmentation of episodes into smaller and smaller 'units' thereby increasing \nthe challenge of co-ordinating what become separate events. In addition, \nand in order to cope, individuals adopt responsive strategies that enhance \ntheir ability to follow space-time trajectories of their own choosing. But when \neveryone else is doing the same, the problem of co-ordination increases \nfurther\u2019 (Shove 2002, 5). \n \nThe need for different ICTs is thus evolving, not static. The tasks for which ICTs are \nnecessary change. For a long time, techno-advocates have seen ICTs as a \u2018good thing\u2019 \nand necessary when many people still see them as incidental to their life (Crabtree, \nNathan et al. 2002, page 5). The digital divide had not been \u2018impacting\u2019 on people\u2019s daily \nroutines. However, as ICTs become bound into the warp and weft of everyday life, \nactivities come to depend upon them. We had asked respondents whether they used \nemail, PCs and mobile phones instead of going places, and it became clear from the \nreplies this question did not really make sense to them. In terms of PCs, they could talk \nabout online purchases. But for pervasive users, and almost everyone with mobile phones, \nthe answers broke down. These ICTs were so bound in to co-dependent patterns of action \nand mobility that it was no longer possible to conceptually disentangle them \u2013 physical \nmovement depended upon the ability for mediated contact, and mediated contact was \n34 \nnecessitated by patterns of activity. The import of this integration of ICTs as part of the \ninfrastructure holding complex lifestyles together, is that the consequences of not having \nthose technologies actually become more significant. Finally, our study suggests that \npervasive ICT users do seem to have much more individualised usage practices than \nepisodic users . In affluent, professional neighbourhoods where pervasive ICT use is \nincreasingly normalised, collective use of ICTs tends to operate, if at all, purely within \nhouseholds and at the level of the family. Here, mediated links are used to sustain real life \nnetworks. \n \nConversely, our study suggests that, in many lower income and more marginalised \nneighbourhoods, ICT use remains largely episodic. Whilst physical ICT facilities are \npresent to an increasing degree, they tend to be used for specific, instrumental purposes, \nand then switched off. Notably, specific ICT uses remain strongly demarcated in space \nand time from wider, everyday urban lives still marked by a reliance on traditional cash \neconomies, face to face services, and the need to physically travel to sustain economic \nand commercial transactions and social and familial links. Here, especially in \nneighbourhoods like Blakelaw, which have relatively low social turnover and very deep and \nstable social networks, our study suggests that ICT use tends to be more collective and \ncollaborative and less individualised than amongst pervasive ICT users.  \n \nImportantly, such collective, collaborative, and episodic ICT use tends to be largely \ninvisible to conventional digital divide mapping studies. Amongst episodic users, the \nlimited times and spaces where ICT connectivity is made remain notable and distinct from \nthe wider background of everyday life. Whilst such users may escape the time pressures \nof pervasive users, it is also clear that their continued reliance on physical cash, physical \nservices and face to face contacts are likely to be seriously threatened as ICT- based \n35 \npublic and private service provision systems become both normalised and used as a \nrationale for the widespread withdrawal of non-online and face to face alternatives.  \n \nAmongst episodic users, ICT use is strongly mediated by neighbourhood social relations \u2013 \nwhere real world relations sustain online possibilities. In this sense, the neighbourhood \neffect of Lash\u2019s \u2018tame\u2019, stable places acts to enable informational access rather than ICTs \nresulting in turbulent \u2018wild\u2019 flows. Again, such neighbourhood and socially mediated ICT \neffects remain largely ignored within urban digital divide literatures. Such effects suggest \nthat strong local social and neighbourhood relations may work to ameliorate urban digital \ndivides, in that having local social networks including people who go online is more useful \nthat having public access without such networks. Indeed, our evidence suggests that \npublic access provision benefits the more affluent more transient neighbourhood \ndisproportionately. This may suggest thinking through the issue not as public provision of \naccess to artefacts \u2013 socialised use can enable that \u2013 but thinking through what activities \nwould benefit from what public terminals. \n \nFinally, our study suggests major implications both for the future study of urban digital \ndivides, and for policy initiatives aimed at ameliorating them. Drawing from our conceptual \nand empirical perspective on multispeed urbanism, the digital inequalities of cities are not \nsustained by stark and dualistic geographies separating information \u2018haves\u2019 and \u2018have \nnots.\u2019 Rather, we would argue that conceptualisations now need to centre, first, on variable \nstyles and speeds of ICT use, and, second, on the diverse ways in which such styles and \nspeeds support, or inhibit, transformations in the logistics of everyday urban life for \ndifferent groups of users.  \n \n36 \nTwo particularly important distinctions, according to our research, are between \ninstrumental and episodic ICT users on the one hand and users for whom new media \nconstellations are a pervasive, increasingly taken for granted, and culturally invisible \nunderpinning of everyday life on the other. Our choice of contrasting neighbourhoods \npresents them as perhaps too stark a contrast. We would suggest what we see is an axis \nof intensity of use. This is clearly not just a function of income, but work versus leisure \nhabits, income and education. The issue is what benefits people are deriving from access, \nand indeed what pressures, and how this is configuring lives. The configuration of what is \ndone online and what offline and why, is what shifts \u2013 not simply having access.  Nor is it \nsimply the case that \u2018going online\u2019 is a sign of privilege. An affluent consumer may preview \nonline, but examine goods in person; they may buy in person but phone elsewhere for \nadvice while in the store, and pay online later; a poor consumer may get a friend to \npurchase online for economy and pay that friend by cash in instalments. i \n \nSuch a perspective suggests that looking at the ways in which ICTs are being enrolled in \nattempts to enhance organisational capacities and orchestrate the time-space logistics of \neveryday life reveals striking differences which are usually ignored in both urban digital \ndivide studies and policy initiatives. Moreover, it suggests that a major divide in the \nlogistical enrolment of ICTs into urban life -- between episodic, often socially mediated use \nand pervasive use where the organisational power and tempo of life are more deeply \nmediated \u2013 is emerging which will profoundly influence the ways in which ICTs relate to \nurban inequality in the next decade.  \n \nFour important research questions emerge here which are beyond the scope of the current \npaper and which might therefore prove useful foci for future research. First, how do \npatterns of pervasive and episodic ICTs work to shape the broader social inequalities \n37 \nwithin cities, as ICT-mediated consumption, work and communication becomes ever-more \nnormalised, assumed, and taken for granted, and so are used to radically restructure \nurban geographies of service provision? Second, what social and economic advantages \ndo pervasive user communities attain and, conversely, how does episodic ICT use work to \nshape the broader prospects of marginalised groups and neighbourhoods?  Third, can \nepisodic user communities eventually migrate towards pervasive use over time as \nbroadband and wireless connectivities diffuse through city geographies and broader styles \nof ICT use become normalised beyond the \u2018early adopters\u2019 and their neighbourhoods? As \ninteractive content becomes part of mobile phones and digital TV, will this pull more into a \npervasive moving between media?  Finally, how can urban digital divides shaped by \ncontrasts between pervasive and episodic user communities be addressed through \ninnovations in public and social  policy?  \n \nAcknowledgement \n \nThis research was made possible by a grant from the ESRC for the project \u2018Multispeed  \nCities and the Logistics of Everyday Life\u2019 (RES-335-25-0015) as part of the E-Society \nprogramme.
