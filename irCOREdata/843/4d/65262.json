Various theoretical explanations of the pathways and mechanisms \nunderlying this inequality have been developed \n1-3\n. The main explanations give primacy to \nmaterial, behavioural or psychosocial factors (Box 1). However, these factors appear to both \nindependently influence the social gradient in mortality, whilst also being interrelated to one \nanother. They may also account for different aspects of social inequalities in health at \ndifferent stages (the lifecourse approach\n2\n \u2013 Box 1). Therefore, several empirical studies have \nbeen undertaken to establish the relative importance of each of these factors \n4-8\n. These studies, \nwhich have utilised either education or income as measures of socio-economic status, found \nthat material factors account for the largest amount of educational inequalities in health\n7 8\n \nwhereas a vigorous discussion has developed as to whether income inequalities in health are \nmainly due to an uneven distribution in access to resources \n5\n or due to psychosocial \nperceptions of these inequalities \n6\n. The contribution of behavioural factors has varied \nsomewhat across studies \n9 10\n. \n \nIn addition to these social factors, biomedical factors represent another possible explanation \nof inequalities in mortality (Box 1). For example, studies have found associations between \nlow socioeconomic position (SEP) and higher prevalence of biomedical risk factors such as \nobesity, high blood pressure, glucose intolerance etc. \u2013  11 12 Except for some external causes \nof death, health effects of material, psychosocial and behavioural factors work through \nbiological mechanisms. In previous research, biomedical factors have mainly been studied \nseparately, or in relation to one or more social factors \n12\n. Little attention has been paid to what \nrole biomedical factors play in addition to social factors and how they might contribute to \ninequalities in mortality \n4 11\n. If we had sufficient information on biological processes leading \n 6 \nto mortality, biological factors would perhaps explain a large proportion of SE differentials in \nmortality. However, based on available data, only known biomedical factors are being \nemployed. \n \nIn this study we therefore add known biomedical factors into the explanatory model of \nincome and educational inequalities in mortality presented by van Oort and colleagues \n8\n \n(Figure 1), thereby developing the following conceptual framework: material factors might \naffect health inequalities directly or indirectly through psychosocial, behavioural or  \nbiomedical factors; psychosocial factors might work directly, or indirectly through \nbehavioural or through biomedical factors; behavioural factors may be either direct or indirect \nvia an interplay with biomedical factors. The direction of causality is two-way, as for example  \nbiomedical factors can also affect material factors (e.g. making unemployment more or less \nlikely), however the direction from material factors through behavioural is more probable \nthan the other way around \n7\n.  \n \nOur exploratory study aims to assess the independent and combined contribution of material, \npsychosocial, behavioural and biomedical factors to the explanation of socio-economic \n(education and income) inequalities in mortality.  \n \nDATA AND METHODS \nThe Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag Health Study (HUNT 2, 1995-97) is based on a cross-sectional survey of \na county population in middle Norway (www.hunt.ntnu.no) with linked mortality data from a \n7 year follow up period. All inhabitants of the county aged 20 years or more were invited to \nparticipate (71 % of the adult population participated). In the age range 24-80 years, 59039 \npersons were eligible for our analysis. From this sample, persons with missing information on \n 7 \neducation or income (men, n=1223, women, n = 1705) were excluded. In order to control for \nthe above mentioned reversed causation (sick people might change their behaviour (such as \nphysical activity), weight, become unemployed etc.), persons having a history of any of the \nfollowing diseases were also excluded from the analysis (men: n=8471, women, n=11.115): \ncardiovascular diseases (including angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, stroke, and \nhypertension), musculoskeletal diseases (including ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritis, \nrheumatid arthritis, and osteoporosis), thyorid diseases (including hypothyroidism, goiter, and \nhyperthyroidism), cancer, asthma and diabetes. Finally, 18 247 men and 18 278 women were \nsubject to our analysis. The sample was linked to the national death registry, which provides a \nfollow-up until the end of year 2003, and to data on income from Statistics Norway. The data \nlinkage was provided and administrated by Statistics Norway, on the basis of a unique \n\u201cpersonal identity number\u201d.  \n \nSocioeconomic variables  \nThe original educational variable in HUNT 2 \n13\n was reclassified into three levels of the \nhighest educational level achieved - primary (up to 10 years education), secondary (up to 12 \nyears education), and tertiary (at least 13 years), which is the reference category.  \n \nThe income variable stems from the tax registry data on individual pension-qualifying income \nin 1995. Income quartiles were created separately for men and women, based on income \ndistribution in the whole HUNT 2 survey, as the income distribution was dissimilar between \nsexes. People with no pensionable income were included in the I. quartile category. The \nquartile with the highest income was used as a reference category (quartile IV). \n \nMaterial, psychosocial, behavioural and biomedical factors \n 8 \nThe group of material factors included an indicator of employment status (in labour force, \nunemployed, retired, in military service\/education process), receipt of any public benefit \n(dichotomised: yes \u2013 no) and a question on perceived financial difficulties (dichotomised: \noften \u2013 now and again \/ rarely). \n \nData describing psychosocial factors included indicators of civil status (married, single, \ndivorced\/separated, widowed), number of good friends (dichotomised: 0-1 good friend, >1), \nparticipation in club activities (dichotomised: less or more than 1 times per month) and self \nesteem (dichotomised: 0-9 points or higher score). Symptoms of anxiety and depression were \nmeasured by 14 four-point Likert-scaled items, 7 for anxiety (HADS-A) and 7 for depression \n(HADS-D) \n14\n. Scores of these scales were dichotomised with cut-off levels >=8 for anxiety \nand the same for depression.    \n \nBehavioural factors were measured by information about smoking (more or less than 20 \ncigarettes per day, being a former smoker, never smoked), alcohol consumption (moderate: 1-\n14 drinks in 2 weeks, excessive: >14 drinks in 2 weeks, abstinent), and caffeine consumption \n(<7 cups of coffee a day, excessive: >= 7 cups a day). Physical activity measured in two \nquestions was scored with number of hours per week spent on activity type - hard physical \nactivity was given twice as much weight as slight physical activity (inactive 0-1 hours per \nweek, moderately active 2-5 hours a week, active 6-9 hours per week). Missing information \non either hard or slight physical activity was replaced by the modus value typical for persons \nwho performed the same amount of non-missing activity.                            \n \nKnown biomedical factors included BMI measure in three categories (<20, 20-30, >= 30), \ndichotomised measures of glucose (higher or lower than 8.0), waist (higher or lower than 102 \n 9 \ncm), waist-to-hip ratio (higher or lower than 0.91), triglycerides (higher or lower than 2.25), \nHDL cholesterol (higher or lower than 0.9). Hypertension was defined as having systolic \nblood pressure higher than 140 and\/or diastolic blood pressure higher than 90. High \ncholesterol category is represented by values higher than 6.9, low cholesterol by values lower \nthan 4.7, range 4.7 \u2013 6.9 was used as a reference category.  \n \nA sensitivity analysis with continuous variables instead of dummy variables where eligible, \nresulted in similar estimates, with a higher potential of gradient explanation with dummy \nvariables. By means of dummy variable adjustment we also checked whether exclusion of \nmissing categories from the analysis would affect the results, and it was not the case. \n \nStatistical analyses \nAge adjusted hazard ratios for levels of education and income, respectively, were calculated \nby Cox regression models separately for men and women, since there was an income-gender  \ninteraction. Although there was no interaction between gender and education, we also \nconducted separate analysis of education by gender for reasons of consistency. Explanatory \nfactors with a risk of mortality not including the HR 1.00 were selected for further analyses. \nThe reference model consists of hazard ratios for mortality adjusted for age only. Further \nmodels were adjusted for material, behavioural, psychosocial, and biomedical factors \nseparately, further adjusted for combinations of two factors, then adjusted for three factors \nand finally adjusted for all explanatory factors simultaneously. For each regression model, the \npercentage change in hazard ratios of each level of education and income, respectively, was \ncalculated. (100 x (HR reference model \u2013 HR explanatory factors) \/ (HR reference model -1). \nThe independent effect of an explanatory factor was assessed by subtracting the percentage \nreduction of hazard ratios of a model without this factor from a model including this factor. \n 10 \nThe indirect effect of an explanatory factor (the overlap between two factors) was calculated \nby subtraction of the independent contribution of the explanatory factor from the total \ncontribution of this factor\n8\n.  \n \nRESULTS \nTables 1a and 1b show the associations between education, income and mortality for men and \nwomen. Since there was no income or educational gradient in mortality amongst women, we \nrestricted further analysis to men only and computed hazard ratios of mortality by explanatory \nfactors. Causes of death in men included ischemic heart disease (121), stroke (49), other \ncirculatory diseases (92), lung cancer (54), prostate cancer (27), other cancer (190), accidents \nand violent causes (64), respiratory (21) and other and unknown causes of death (89). All \nbehavioural and psychosocial factors were associated with mortality. In known biomedical \nfactors, triglycerides and HDL cholesterol measures were not associated with mortality, \nneither were financial difficulties in the group of material factors (Table 2). These factors \nwere excluded from further analyses. In table 3, age standardized baseline prevalence of high-\nrisk categories in explanatory factors are presented, by educational and income level, \nrespectively. Risk factors were more prevalent in lower educated groups and in lower income \ncategories.  \n \n---- TABLE 1 HERE ---- \n \n---- TABLE 2 HERE ---- \n \n---- TABLE 3 HERE ---- \n \n 11 \nEducational inequalities in mortality \nThe relative risk of mortality was considerably higher in lower educated groups in \ncomparison to the group with highest education (model 1, table 4a). This risk was attenuated \nwhen adjusted for different groups of explanatory factors. Adjustment for psychosocial \nfactors (model 4, Table 4a) and behavioural factors (model 3) lowered the hazard ratios most \n(29 to 37%), followed by material (model 2) and biomedical factors (model 5). Adjustment \nfor behavioural factors in addition to psychosocial factors (model 9, Table 4a) lowered the \nrisk of mortality by 51 and 60 %. The independent contribution of behavioural factors in \nrelation to psychosocial factors was higher than that of biomedical factors (17- 24 % versus 3-\n10 %). The large independent effect of psychosocial factors accompanied by similarly large \nindependent effect of behavioural factors is illustrated in Fig. 2. Inclusion of material and \nbiomedical factors further decreased the hazard ratios - that implicates that all groups of \nfactors independently contributed to the explanation of educational inequalities.  \n \n--- TABLE 4A HERE --- \n \n--- TABLE 4B HERE --- \n \nIncome inequalities in mortality \nIn income, the risk of mortality was higher in lower income groups in comparison to the \nhighest quartile (but not in the second highest quartile) (model 1, Table 4b). The largest \nproportional decrease in hazard ratios when adjusted for explanatory factors was accounted \nfor by material factors (11 to 52 %) (model 2, table 4b), followed by psychosocial, \nbehavioural and biomedical factors. Further adjustment for psychosocial factors in addition to \nmaterial factors lowered the hazard ratios by another 23 % (model 6, table 4b) (Fig. 2). The \n 12 \nindependent contribution of psychosocial factors was also higher than that of behavioural \nfactors. Adjustment for all factors further reduced the hazard ratios.  \n \nDISCUSSION \nOur results suggest that material factors are most important in explaining income inequalities \nin men\u2019s mortality, while psychosocial and behavioural factors are more important in the \nexplanation of educational inequalities. Our findings are in contrast to those from the van \nOort et al. study \n8\n and the study from Schrijvers et al. \n7\n, where material factors represented the \nmost important explanation of educational inequalities in mortality in the Netherlands. An \nunexpected finding was that subjective perceptions of financial difficulties were not  \nassociated with the risk of mortality in our sample. Inclusion of other factors such as material \nassets or house tenure to material factors might have resulted in higher contribution of \nmaterial factors to the explanation of educational inequalities.  \n \nWe found no evidence for an association between education, income and mortality during \nseven years follow-up of a group of Norwegian women (with no history of a serious disease at \nbaseline). Socioeconomic inequalities in women in Norway and other Western European \ncountries are generally smaller than among men, but usually still having a meaningful \nmagnitude. Other studies have suggested that in Norway educational and income inequalities \nin women\u2019s mortality have even increased during recent years 1 15. However, a HUNT based \nstudy on self reported morbidity found a trend of decreasing educational inequalities for both \nmen and women in the Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag county \n16\n. A sensitivity analysis confirmed that our \nfinding can be explained by the exclusion of people with a history of serious disease and a \nhigher prevalence of diseases in lower SE groups in women. Musculosceletal disorders and \nthyroid diseases were more prevalent in women, however their exclusion did no affect the \n 13 \nsize of SE differences in women. The non-existent gradient among women in our study can \nalso be partly explained by a different pattern of causes of death. In our selected sample of \nwomen, cause of death by cancer was more prevalent than cardiovascular causes of death, \nwhereas in the original sample, cardiovascular causes of death were most prevalent. \nCommonly, cancer mortality is known to show smaller SE differences than cardiovascular \ndiseases \n1\n. In addition, the relatively short follow-up period implies that we have observed \nmortality from conditions with rather short survival periods. The prevalence of mediating \nfactors in women according to education and income levels was also less unequally \ndistributed than among men.  \n \nOur findings for men are in line with life course theories, which suggest that different aspects \nof social inequalities in health can be explained by different pathways\n17\n. While the \n(neo)material pathway (focusing on material disadvantages) seems to be most valid \nexplanation for income inequalities in mortality, our results implicate that pathways resulting \nfrom educational attainment are different. Education, which shapes one\u2019s life in young \nadulthood, seems to play an important role in establishing networks and partnership and \nsetting a normative framework for behavioural norms and practices. Material factors like \nemployment status and receipt of public benefits as indicators of financial situation and \ncurrent living status represent a straightforward explanation of income inequalities in \nmortality, but probably point out to a life long accumulation of disadvantages \n18\n. Low paid \npersons are more prone to unemployment\n19\n and public benefits receipt; while being employed \nmight provide additional material benefits. Nonetheless, employment status and social \nbenefits might also be interpreted in terms of health selection, and the reverse causal direction \nto income can not be totally disregarded. However, we controlled for the reversed pathway by \nexcluding people with health problems from the analysis. \n 14 \n \nPsychosocial factors could explain part of the material factors\u2019 effect, and they also \nconstituted an independent pathway besides material factors. The relative contribution of \nmaterial factors seemed to support the (neo)material explanation of income inequalities in \nmortality \n5\n. However, psychosocial factors contributed much more than material factors to the \nexplanation of mortality in the third income quartile, which gives support to the psychosocial \ninterpretation of income inequalities in health \n6\n. A substantial part of the effect of material \nfactors could not be explained by other factors.  \n \nThe explanatory role of known biomedical factors was rather modest. Particularly \npsychosocial factors seem to be more important than known biomedical factors. However, \nincluding more, and more comprehensive biomedical factors might yield a higher importance \nof biomedical factors. Health conditions might be a result of accumulation of biological risks \nover life course \u2013 thus adverse conditions measured over longer time might explain more than \ncurrent status \n20\n. The relatively weak mediatory effect of known biomedical factors might \nhave been influenced by the analytical design of the study. Since precursors of adult mortality \ninequalities might develop early in life\n21\n, or accumulate through the life course\n22\n, exclusion of \npersons with pre-existing serious illness from the analysis could differentially impact on the \nmost deprived groups with the strongest biomedical markers of health problems established at \nan earlier stage in life. Biomedical factors available in our study included mostly measures \nthat are more closely related to CVD mortality. Biomedical factors contributed most to the \nexplanation of CVD mortality inequalities, while in cancer mortality their contribution was \nnegligible (results not shown). Further longitudinal studies including more comprehensive \ninformation on biomedical factors and studies of cause specific mortality might help to \nincrease our knowledge about this pathway. \n 15 \nThe large independent effect of psychosocial factors, which can not be reduced to behavioural \nnor biomedical explanation, is worth further examination. It implies, that the effect of \ninsufficient social networks can not be boiled down to adverse health behaviours and \nbiomedical conditions, but releases other mechanisms which are directly associated with \nmortality. Even though more precise measurement of bodily response to adverse psychosocial \nconditions might become available \n12\n, we suggest that effective prevention would need to \nfocus on the underlying causes. \n \nLimitations  \nAlthough our data have some strengths (availability of data for men and women, four major \ngroups of explanatory factors), there are also some limitations. The selection of explanatory \nfactors has several implications for our study. We made a literature-based selection of \nprobably most important items for our four groups of explanatory factors\n4 23\n. Some of the \nestablished mediating factors were not strong predictors for mortality in our study, and were \nthus excluded, although in other populations, they might play a substantial role in explaining \nsocial inequalities. It is possible that inclusion of other factors (such as material, psychosocial \nand biomedical variables), which were not available in our survey, might have led to slightly \ndifferent results. Measurement error introduced by selection of variables and measurement \naccuracy of those variables might have resulted in an underestimation of the contribution of \nexplanatory factors. A study design with repeated measurements over time or with more \nindicators at one time might yield more precise estimates, and the size of measurement error \ncould be assessed \n24\n.  \n \nThe decomposition of direct and indirect effect for mediators is based on the assumptions of \ncausal relationship between mediators and outcome, no interaction by the mediators and no \n 16 \nconfounding for the exposure-outcome association and mediator-outcome association\n25-27\n. \nPotential confounding factors, which were not included in the analysis might have led to \nunpresice estimation of factors contribution. Our conceptual diagram might not represent the \n\u201ctrue\u201d state, but is a tool to analyze associations under a selected set of causal assumptions28. \nNevertheless, the causal direction from material factors through psychosocial factors on \nhealth might also work the other way. Mutual influences in both directions might be most \nlikely. In future research, it is important to examine the causal associations in studies with \nrepeated measurements. \n \nThe assumption of downstream effects of mediating variables from socioeconomic exposures \nis limited by the cross-sectional design of the study. In order to diminish possible reversed \ncausality (sick people might change their behaviour), 35 % of men were excluded from the \nanalysis due to history of disease. Since these diseases are more prevalent in lower SEP \ngroups, a larger group from low SEP has been filtered out. A sensitivity analysis revealead \nthat adjustment for all chronic condition led to smaller SE differences, and a slight \noverestimation of explanatory factors.  \n \nWe combined people with no income and the I. income quartile group. Because income data \nare given only for pensionable earnings (and do not include pensions), retired pensioners \nwithout additional incomes fall under the same category as people without income. This \nresulted in slightly higher mortality estimates for the lowest income category.  In addition, we \nconducted a sensitivity analysis with household income and with individual income as a \ncontinuous measure, which produced similar results as income differences by quartiles.. \n \n 17 \nA sensitivity analysis, from which people who died within the first two years of follow-up \nwere excluded, yielded the same result in respect to educational inequalities, whereas in \nrespect to income inequalities in mortality, a slight increase in the hazard rates for mortality \nby income quartiles was observed.  \n \nThe perspective employed in this paper focused on explaining relative inequalities. \nBiomedical and behavioural factors seem to contribute relatively little to the explanation. \nHowever, if we were to focus on absolute inequalities in the population, removing the \nconventional risk factors would perhaps result in stronger reduction of absolute inequalities\n29\n.  \n \nCONCLUSION \nMost of the socio-economic inequalities in men could be explained by a combination of \npsychosocial, material and behavioural factors, whose independent effects persisted after \nmutual adjustment. This supports the life course explanation of health inequalities - at least \nfor men (Box 1). These results suggest that in order to decrease socio-economic inequalities \nin mortality amongst men there is a need to focus more on underlying social factors. It might \nbe most efficient to promote social networks, to facilitate employment amongst disadvantaged \ngroups and to facilitate health promoting behaviour. Further longitudinal studies should \nexamine more comprehensively the relative functioning of social and biomedical factors \nacross the life course. \n \n 18 \n  \nBox 1: Theories of health inequality (\n2 18\n) \n \n  \nMaterialist \nThe (neo)materialist explanation gives primacy to material conditions. It therefore focuses \nnot only on income itself but on what income enables \u2013 access to goods and services and \nexposures to material (physical) risk factors (poor housing, inadequate diet, physical \nhazards at work, environmental exposures). The neo-materialist approach also focuses on \nthe relationship of public service provision such as schools and transport and welfare to \npopulation health.  \n \nBehavioural  \nIn a direct behavioural explanation, the link between socio-economic status and health is \ndifferences in health related behaviour as a result of adverse personal\/psychological \ncharacteristics. Social inequalities in health are therefore due to a higher distribution of \npeople with less desirable characteristics in lower socio-economic groups. A more cultural-\nbehavioural explanation suggests that such differences in health behaviour are a \nconsequence of disadvantage and that unhealthy behaviour may be more culturally \nacceptable amongst lower socio-economic groups.   \n \nPsychosocial  \nPsychosocial explanations focus on how social inequality makes people feel \u2013 \ndomination\/subordination, superiority\/inferiority \u2013 and the effects of the biological \nconsequences of these feelings on health. The socio-economic gradient is therefore \nexplained by the unequal social distribution of psychosocial risk factors such as social \nsupport, work demands and levels of control, or imbalances in effort-reward.  \n \nBiomedical \nBiomedical approach provides explanation in terms of unequal prevalence of biological risk \nfactors across different social groups and represents the most proximal link between social \ncharacteristics and health condition. It aims to explain how in particular behavioural and \npsychosocial factors affect body physiological functioning and focuses on pathways leading \nto chronic diseases as well as on the interplay between genes and environment. \n  \nLifecourse \nThe lifecourse approach combines aspects of the other explanations, thereby allowing \ndifferent causal mechanisms and processes to explain the social gradient in different \ndiseases. It also highlights the role of the accumulation of disadvantage over the lifecourse \u2013 \ncombining the amount of time different people have spent in more\/less disadvantaged \ncircumstances. Health inequality between social groups is therefore a result of inequalities \nin the accumulation of social, psychological, and biological advantages and disadvantages \nover time.  \n \n 19 \nFunding: This work was supported by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology \n(NTNU). \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: \nThe Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag Health Study (the HUNT study) is a collaboration between the National \nHealth Screening Service of Norway, Oslo, the National Institute of Public Health, \nCommunity Medicine Research Unit, Verdal, the Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag County Council and the \nNorwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). \n \nCompeting interest statement.
