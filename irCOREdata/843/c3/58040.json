Introduction \n \nBy definition, regional ocean models do not cover the whole globe and, in many cases, have \nopen boundaries in deep water. In order to include the influence of large scale oceanic \ncirculation, information on ocean dynamics and water properties outside the model area must \nbe provided to the model at the boundaries. These external data might be taken from \nobservations (often climatological) or from numerical models covering larger areas at reduced \nresolution. Data from deep ocean models have the advantage of generally higher spatial and \ntemporal resolutions over larger areas and longer time periods than is possible with \nobservations. Also, as is now common practice, the available observations are blended into \nthe ocean model solution through data assimilation. Ocean model data also provide a \nconsistent dataset with the pressure (sea surface and thermohaline structure) and currents in \ndynamical balance. The higher spatial resolution and more homogeneous coverage also make \ndeep ocean models a good source of initial conditions for regional models. Unless the same \nnumerical model is used for the regional model and the model providing the boundary \ncondition, there may, however, be difficulties caused by differences in the physics of the two \nmodels. \n \nThe northeast Atlantic is a complex region with water depths ranging from more than 5500m \nto the west of Spain to less than 150m over large areas of the northwest Europe continental \n 2 \nshelf (Fig. 1). The region is affected by large-scale currents such as the Gulf Stream, the slope \ncurrent that extends along much of the edge of the continental shelf, the intricate flows and \noverflows of pathways between the Atlantic Ocean and the Nordic seas and the \npredominantly anti-clockwise motion in the North Sea. Of particular importance to ocean-\nshelf exchanges, the slope current is a continuous and persistent flow along the edge of the \ncontinental shelf from south of Porcupine Bank to the Faeroe-Shetland Channel, with \ntransports ~1\u22122Sv (1Sv = 106 m3s-1) in the Rockall Channel and ~4\u22127Sv in the Faeroe-\nShetland Channel (Huthnance and Gould, 1989).  \n \nThe Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory Coastal Ocean Model System (POLCOMS) is a \nthree-dimensional baroclinic B-grid model described by Holt and James (2001) and Proctor \nand James (1996). It is a primitive equation finite difference model in spherical polar s-\ncoordinates. It has been used and validated over a wide range of scales (resolutions ~1.8 to \n~25km) and areas (Holt and James, 2001; Holt and James, 2006; Holt and Proctor 2003; Holt \net al. 2005). POLCOMS has been developed to model baroclinic processes over a range of \nenvironments from shallow shelf regions, across the shelf slope and into the deep ocean and is \na suitable tool for modelling the challenging environment of the northeast Atlantic. \n \nHere we use published climatologies and data from two different operational ocean models as \nopen boundary conditions for a northeast Atlantic implementation of POLCOMS. The focus \nof this work is on the affect that the different boundary datasets have on the circulation on the \ncontinental shelf. Specifically, we examine how sensitive the modelled circulation and the \nassociated temperature field are to the open boundary condition relative to the model being \nused. \n \n2. The model \n \nThe POLCOMS model is applied to the northeast Atlantic Ocean (the \u201cAtlantic Margin\u201d) \nusing essentially the formulation described by Holt and James (2001). The principal change to \nthe model is the addition of horizontal diffusion\/viscosity to the velocity, temperature and \nsalinity fields in order to improve stability in deep water. For the horizontal diffusion \ncalculation, the physics fields are interpolated onto z-levels and multiplied by a depth-\ndependent diffusion coefficient (AH = 0 for H < 200m, AH = 0.2Hm2s-1 for 200m < H < \n3000m, AH = 600m2s-1 for H > 3000m).  \n \n \n Fig. 1 Depth contours of the Atlantic Margin model. Contour \nintervals are 20m for 0-160m and 500m for 500-5500m. The \ncoloured region is the continental shelf with depths < 150m. \nThe thick black lines and corresponding labels denote the \nlocations of sections referred to in the text \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3\nThe Atlantic Margin Model (AMM) domain (Fig. 1) extends from the deep ocean to the coast \nfrom 40\u00baN to 65\u00baN and 20\u00baW to 13\u00baE. The grid spacing is 1\/9\u00b0 latitude by 1\/6\u00b0 longitude \n(~12km resolution) with N = 34 levels in the vertical.  \n \nThe vertical levels are in s-coordinates (modified \u03c3-coordinates) to allow increased resolution \nnear the surface and bed in deeper water. Following Song and Haidvogel (1994) and Holt and \nJames (2001), \u03c3-levels are defined by  \n[ ]kk\nji\ncji\nkk SSCh\nhh\nS \u2212\u2212+= )(\n,\n,\u03c3 , for hi,j > hc, and kk S=\u03c3 , for hi,j \u2264 hc , \nwhere the Sk are N \u2212 1 evenly spaced levels between \u03c3 = \u22121 and \u03c3 = 0, hc = 150m is a critical \ndepth and hi,j is the undisturbed water depth at point (i, j). The function C(Sk) is defined by  \n( ) ( ) ( ) [ ]( ) ( )( )\u03b8\n\u03b8\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n5.0tanh2\n5.0tanh5.0tanh\nsinh\nsinh1 \u2212++\u2212= kkk SBSBSC , \nwhere 6=\u03b8  and 8.0=B . State variables are defined at points midway between the k\u03c3  levels \nat ( )15.0 ++ kk \u03c3\u03c3  for k = 1, 2, ..., N \u2212 2. Additionally, to simplify the calculations at the \nboundaries, position 0=k  is defined at half a level below the sea bed and 1\u2212= Nk  is \ndefined at half a level above the sea surface.  \n \n2.1. Bathymetry \n \nBathymetry was obtained from the British Oceanographic Data Centre (P. Weatherall, \npersonal communication, 1999). The bathymetry data were smoothed to remove some \nroughness in the deeper regions, which helps to reduce unstable eddies in the model, and at \nthe western boundary near 55\u00baN to help prevent eddies from becoming trapped on the \nboundary.  \n \nIn \u03c3-coordinate models, the calculation of the horizontal pressure gradient term traditionally \ninvolves estimating pressure gradients along the \u03c3-levels and then correcting for the slope of \nthe coordinate. These methods are prone to significant and well-known errors (e.g. Haney, \n1991, Mellor et al., 1994) and, to overcome this problem, POLCOMS uses a method of \nestimating the horizontal pressure gradient term (Holt and James, 2001) by interpolating onto \nz-levels. However, in addition to using improved algorithms to reduce pressure gradient \nerrors, some bathymetric smoothing is still needed to ensure realistic simulations using \nterrain-following coordinate systems in regions of large depth variations (Haidvogel et al., \n2000). In the Atlantic Margin domain, the relatively coarse model resolution (12km) and \nsteep bathymetry combine to give depth changes exceeding 1800m between grid points at the \nedge of the northwest European Continental Shelf to the west of France and 3600m off the \ncoast of northern Spain. Some additional smoothing of the bathymetry is essential in these \nareas. \n \nThe model bathymetry was smoothed to reduce the maximum depth difference between \nadjacent grid points. Great care was taken during the smoothing process not to disrupt deep \nwater pathways to the northwest of the UK and around the Faeroe Islands and smoothing was \nkept to the minimum which allowed a realistic slope current to develop. The smoothing was \ncarried out by searching for points (i, j) where in the surrounding 13 by 13 point box (i\u22126:i+6, \nj\u22126:j+6) depths extended from less than 200m to greater than 800m. At such points, the \nbathymetry was averaged over 3 by 3 points along most of the edge of the continental shelf \nand over 9 by 9 points for the steepest section along the Spanish coast and up to 45\u00b0N. To \n 4 \npreserve the width of the continental shelf, no smoothing was done at points where the \noriginal depth was less than 100m. At the end of the smoothing process, the maximum depth \ndifference between adjacent points was around 1600m off the coast of northern Spain and \n1300m elsewhere along the continental slope. \n \nThe original steep bathymetry affected results in the AMM by preventing the slope current, \nobserved to flow along the edge of the continental shelf, from forming; the revised \nbathymetry allows a slope current in good agreement with Huthnance and Gould (1989) and \nSouza et al (2000). \n \n2.2. Initial and boundary conditions \n \nThe model is forced by mean sea level pressure, 10m winds, air temperature, relative \nhumidity and cloud cover from ECMWF operational analyses. All data are available 6-hourly, \nexcept for the clouds which are daily. Freshwater discharges from 279 European rivers \n(Young and Holt, 2007) are also included along with inflow from the Baltic. Tides are \nincorporated by using elevation and current boundary data of 15 tidal constituents from a two-\ndimensional 30km-resolution model of the northeast Atlantic (Flather, 1981) and by including \nthe equilibrium tide. Two sets of sub-tidal boundary conditions of barotropic currents and sea \nsurface elevation are used, taken from two different operational models covering the North \nAtlantic. The total (tide + density component) current and elevation data are used in a \nflux\/radiation boundary condition. The same operational models provide temperature and \nsalinity data around the AMM boundary, interpolated on to the AMM s-levels. The modelled \ntemperature and salinity are relaxed to the boundary data in a four-gridpoint-wide region \naround the model boundaries. Climatological temperature and salinity are also used to attempt \nto quantify the merits of model data over climate data in providing boundary conditions for \nregional models.  \n \nThe two operational models used to supply boundary conditions to the AMM are the \nForecasting Ocean Assimilation Model (FOAM, UK Met. Office, Bell et al., 2000) and the \nNavy Coastal Ocean Model (NCOM, US Naval Research Laboratory, Barron et al., 2006). \nThe FOAM initial conditions are for 1st January 1998 and boundary data are available every \nsix hours until the end of 2003. The FOAM dataset is a combination of three FOAM runs with \nchanges in forcing, parameters assimilated and\/or model developments at April 2000 and \nNovember 2003. The NCOM initial conditions are for 1st April 2001 and the boundary data \nare available daily until 15th December 2001 and thereafter six-hourly until the end of 2003. \nClimate temperature and salinity data were taken from the World Ocean Atlas 2005 \n(WOA05) database (Antonov et al., 2006 and Locarnini et al., 2006). The climate data consist \nof 12 monthly-mean temperature and salinity fields; initial fields are calculated for 1st January \n1998 by averaging the January and December means. \n \nThe FOAM model is based on the Bryan-Cox model (Bryan, 1969; Cox, 1984) with 1\/3\u00b0 \nhorizontal resolution and 20 z-levels in the vertical and includes assimilation of observed \ntemperature and sea level. The NCOM model is based on the Princeton Ocean Model (POM, \nBlumberg and Mellor, 1987) with ~1\/8\u00b0 horizontal resolution in mid-latitudes and 40 vertical \nlevels (19 \u03c3-levels near the surface with the remainder being z-levels). NCOM assimilates \ntemperature and salinity observations. \n \nExamples of the boundary data for 2002 are given in Fig. 2. During 2002, the sea surface \ntemperature fields averaged over each boundary show close agreement between FOAM and \n 5\nNCOM with the main difference being that the FOAM data are ~1\u00b0C lower than the NCOM \ndata at the northern boundary during the last four months of the year. The spatial averages \nalong the western and southern boundaries are also in close agreement with the WOA05 data \nbut the climatological summer temperatures along the northern boundary are several degrees \ncooler than the FOAM and NCOM data. The time-averaged plots show similar spatial \npatterns in the data with maximum differences between the datasets of 3\u00b0C, occurring at the \nnorthern boundary at ~11\u00b0W where the FOAM data is too warm compared to NCOM and \nWOA05. There is fair agreement between the salinity data sets with the climatological values \ngenerally higher than those of the two models but with similar spatial and temporal behaviour. \nThe time-averaged elevations are offset by ~0.25m with FOAM elevations greater than \nNCOM. The FOAM data have an average north-south elevation difference of 0.32m while the \nvalue for NCOM is 0.25m. At the northern boundary, both FOAM and NCOM data feature a \ncoherent northwards-flowing current along the Norwegian coast and a southwards-flowing \ncurrent at the coast of Iceland. The situation on the other boundaries is more complex and \nthere are large differences between the two data sets with the NCOM currents generally larger \nand more variable than those of FOAM. The time variation of the spatial means shows a high \ndegree of coherence, especially at the northern boundary.  \n \nThe Atlantic Margin model was run from rest four times using the combination of initial and \nboundary conditions detailed in table 1. The end date for all runs was 31st December 2003, \nmeaning that the AMM-climate and AMM-FOAM runs are for 72 months and the two \nNCOM-forced runs for 33 months.  \n \n \n \n \nFig. 2a Boundary data of sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface salinity (SSS), elevation and barotropic \ncurrent normal to the boundary at the northern boundary of the AMM.

Results \n \n3.1. Temperature fields \n \nTo assess the accuracy of the model\u2019s sea surface temperature and the sensitivity to the \nboundary and initial condition, the model results are compared to 9km AVHRR data from \nJanuary 1998 to June 2003. For each time, the observations are interpolated onto the model \ngrid and the mean and RMS differences to the corresponding model value calculated (Fig. 3). \nErrors calculated over the whole domain are generally greater than those calculated only over \nthe shelf and are larger in summer than in winter. By May 2001, the model is consistently \nunderestimating the temperature by an average of about 0.5oC on the shelf and 0.5\u20131.5oC over \nthe whole domain. The main source of the bias is likely to stem from the vertical mixing and \nsurface heat flux equations used. The RMS errors are ~0.8oC on the shelf and ~1.0oC over the \nwhole domain. The largest RMS errors over the whole domain are for the run using FOAM \nboundary data. After 15 months, the two runs with NCOM boundary conditions have similar \nerrors showing that the affect of the initial condition has diminished. By the same time, the \nerrors of all four model runs are almost identical when calculated over the shelf area only \nindicating that, once the affect of the initial condition has reduced, the sea surface \ntemperatures over the shelf area depend more on the model properties and local \nmeteorological forcing than on the boundary forcing. \n \nThere is evidence of drift in the model sea surface temperatures with the model becoming \nincreasingly too cold compared to AVHRR (Fig. 3).  The AMM-FOAM and AMM-climate \nruns show two distinct time periods. During January 1998 to November 1999 the models have \nmean errors fluctuating around zero; a change occurs during 2000 and, from 2001 onwards, \nthe model progressively underestimates the surface temperature.  Over the whole domain, the \nunderestimation of temperature for AMM-FOAM increases by 0.31\u00b0C year-1 and for AMM-\nclimate by 0.18\u00b0C year-1, compared to AVHRR data. The trends over the shelf are 0.16\u00b0C \nyear-1 (AMM-FOAM) and 0.08\u00b0C year-1 (AMM-climate). The larger drifts for the domain \nwhich includes the deeper water are probably a consequence of lower resolution near the \nsurface in AMM. From January 2002 onwards, the underestimation of surface temperature \ntends to improve over the shelf region in all model runs. \n \n \n \nFig. 3 Comparison with AVHRR sea \nsurface temperature data. RMS errors \n(top set of lines) and mean errors (model \n\u2013 observed, bottom lines) for AMM-\nFOAM (black solid line), AMM-NCOM \n(green solid line), AMM-NCOM(FIC) \n(red dashed line) and AMM-climate \n(blue dashed line). The top figure is for \ncalculations over the whole domain and \nthe bottom one is for just the shelf area \n(coloured shading in Fig. 1) \n \n \n \n \n \n 8 \n \nFig. 4a Mean sea surface temperature fields (\u00b0C) for August 2002. The observed AVHRR data from the \nNOAA\/NASA Ocean Pathfinder satellite are averaged over times that data are available and the model data are \naveraged using the same times. The model runs are defined in Table 1 \n \nThe depth of the mixed layer is calculated as the depth at which the density has increased \nfrom that at the reference depth of 6m by an amount equivalent to a decrease in temperature \nof 0.5\u00b0C. Over most of the domain, the summer mixed layer depths of the model results are \ndeeper than those of the NCOM model by between ~15-20m in the deep regions and ~4-6m in \nthe North Sea. In the deeper regions, the summer mixed layer depths taken from \nclimatological fields are in closer agreement with the NCOM data than with the POLCOMS \nresults. Thus, the vertical mixing in POLCOMS appears too deep, contributing to the model \nunderestimation of sea surface temperature. Between the POLCOMS results, the NCOM data \nand the climatology, there is no dataset with overall shallower or deeper levels of the \npermanent thermocline. The FOAM model dataset is a combination of model runs and only \ndata at the AMM boundary are available. At the AMM boundary, the FOAM mixed layer \ndepths tend to be shallower than those of NCOM in the winter, and deeper in summer. \n \nSea surface temperature maps for August 2002 and February 2003 (Fig. 4) show the spatial \ndetails behind the statistics in Fig. 3. The model runs all exhibit similar features on the shelf \nand overall show good spatial correlations with AVHRR (correlation coefficients for model \nversus AVHRR for February 2003 are r = 0.96 for AMM-FOAM and r = 0.98 for the other \nthree runs).  \n \nIn August 2002, features of the model output in agreement with satellite data include the \nsouthwards flowing tongue of cool water along the coast of northeast England and a patch of \ncooler water on the Faeroe plateau. The mean differences between model and satellite sea \n 9\nsurface temperatures are generally less than 0.3\u00b0C over most of the North Sea. The model \ndoes less well in the Norwegian Coastal Current where too much mixing causes the model to \nunderestimate the SST by 2\u20133\u00b0C, and in the southwest corner of the model where the water is \ngenerally too cold by ~1\u00b0C. The accuracy of AMM-FOAM result at the northern boundary is \nreduced by the FOAM boundary data being ~2.5\u00b0C too warm off the coast of  Iceland and \n~3.5\u00b0C too cold around 5\u00b0W, compared to the satellite data.  \n \nSeveral features of the large-scale near-surface circulation (Hansen and \u00d8sterhus, 2000) are \napparent in the February 2003 AVHRR SST data (Fig. 4b). Around 55-60\u00b0N, 15-20\u00b0W, is an \narea of warmer water associated with the northeastwards flowing North Atlantic Current, \nwhile to the east of that, and extending northwards all along the edge of the continental shelf, \nis an area of warm water associated with the Continental Slope Current. The Norwegian \nCoastal Current is also visible, as a band of cold water along the coast of Norway. The \nlocation of the Iceland-Faeroes Front to the north of the Faeroe Islands is shown by a strong \nchange in the surface temperature. Except for the AMM-climate run, the models recreate well \nthe surface temperature fields associated with the North Atlantic Current and the Continental \nSlope Current. In the AMM-climate run, the warm water extends too far northwards west of \n15\u00b0W. All of the model results show evidence of the Iceland-Faeroes Front but generally \nlocate it further south than shown in the satellite data. The AMM-FOAM run is up to 3\u00b0C too \ncold in this region and the cold water extends too far east, the model runs forced by NCOM \nboundary data have much better agreement with the satellite data than the AMM-FOAM run. \nThe model surface temperatures are all ~0.5\u00b0C too warm in the Norwegian Coastal Current, \nwhen compared to satellite data, but otherwise slightly too cold over the rest of the North Sea. \n \n \nFig. 4b As for Fig. 4a, but for February 2003 \n \n 10 \n \nFig. 5 Errors in near-bed modelled temperatures compared to ICES data over the shelf area (coloured shading in \nFig. 1). RMS errors (top set of lines) and mean errors (model \u2013 observed, bottom lines) for AMM-FOAM (black \nsolid line), AMM-NCOM (green solid line), AMM-NCOM(FIC) (red dashed line) and AMM-climate (blue \ndashed line) \n \nThe sensitivity of the near-bed temperature field on the shelf to the initial and boundary \nconditions is studied by comparing model results with observed data from the International \nCouncil for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES, http:\/\/www.ices.dk\/Ocean\/aspx\/HydChem\/HydChem.aspx). \nFrom 1998-2003 in the shelf region, there are 3477 temperature measurements taken within \n10m of the sea bed. The number of observations per month varies between 3 and 116 with an \naverage of 48, with most of the data being located in the North Sea and the shelf region south \nof Ireland and west of France, and a scattering of points in the Irish Sea and north of Scotland. \nFor each observation, the model temperature field for that day is interpolated to the location \nand the difference between the modelled and observed values is used to calculate the mean \nand RMS errors for each month (Fig. 5).  \n \nThere is a strong seasonal signal in the near-bed RMS errors, ranging from ~0.4\u20130.5\u00b0C in \nspring to ~1.6\u20132.1\u00b0C in autumn with average values for each run of ~1.1\u00b0C. Initially, the \nnear-bed errors show the models increasingly underestimating the temperature but, from 2000 \nonwards, they fluctuate around a value of ~0.6\u00b0C too cold.  \n \nThe two NCOM-forced runs show that the affect of the initial condition on the near-bed errors \nhas reduced appreciably after nine months of integration. While the major features of the error \ntime series are similar for all of the model runs, there are still differences between them after \n33 months of model time.  \n \n3.2. Volume fluxes and currents \n \nDaily-mean net volume fluxes are calculated for the flows through the 12 sections shown in \nFig. 1 for AMM-FOAM, AMM-climate, AMM-NCOM and AMM-NCOM(FIC). The \nsections are chosen to cross important pathways for the movement of water along the edge of \nthe continental shelf and into and out of the North Sea and the Irish Sea. The volume fluxes \nare calculated by dividing each section into 1km lengths and estimating the flow through each \n1km length by integrating through the water column at surrounding grid points and \ninterpolating. \n \nTable 2 shows the mean volume fluxes through each section and the standard deviations of \nthe time series and table 3 shows the Root Mean Square (RMS) differences and correlation \ncoefficients between the different time series, calculated from daily-mean current fields \nduring 2002 and 2003. Where available, observed data have been included in table 2. Both \nobserved data and model results show large inter-annual variability and the observed means \nare not from the same time frame or exactly co-located in space with the model data and so \n 11\nare only an approximate guide to model accuracy. The agreement between the four model \nruns is generally better for the on-shelf sections in St. George\u2019s Channel, the Dover Strait and \nthe northern North Sea than for the other sections, with correlation coefficients exceeding \n0.95 in these areas.  \n \nThe largest difference between the model runs occurs at section 1 in the Bay of Biscay. The \nmodel time series have low correlations with each other and high RMS differences. \n \nFor the Dover Strait section, the model results are in good agreement with one other and \nhighly correlated. However, the mean flux of 0.01\u20130.02Sv into the North Sea is nearly an \norder of magnitude smaller than the 0.094Sv calculated by Prandle et al (1996) from HF radar \nand bottom-mounted acoustic Doppler current profiler measurements, although the value is \nwithin one standard deviation of the model mean. The model results agree on a net \nnorthwards flow of 0.14Sv through St. George\u2019s Channel, which corresponds to the 0.11\u2013\n0.14Sv volume flux observed by Brown and Gmitrowicz (1995) through the North Channel of \nthe Irish Sea and the value of 0.077\u00b10.013Sv given by Knight and Howarth (1999).  \n \nThe AMM-FOAM, AMM-NCOM and AMM-NCOM(FIC) runs predict a northwards volume \nflux ~2Sv through section 4, south of Porcupine Bank, but the AMM-climate results \ncontradict this by predicting a mean southwards flow. The difference in the results is clarified \nby examining the spatial distribution of the 2002\/2003 mean south-to-north current speed \nacross section 5 (not shown). At the shelf break ~10.8\u00b0W, the two NCOM-forced runs have a \nconcentrated northwards flowing jet with peak average annual-mean speeds of ~0.04ms-1, \nwhile the AMM-FOAM and AMM-climate runs achieve peaks of only 0.02ms-1 with the \nAMM-climate current displaced several grid boxes to the west. The AMM-climate run has \nmostly weak southwards flow in the deep water over the rest of the section while the other \nthree runs have another jet of northwards flowing current at ~11.5\u201312\u00b0W. Pingree and Le \nCann (1989) confirm northwards-flowing currents in water of 960\u20131000m depth at 51\u201352\u00b0N, \n11\u201312\u00b0W. \n \n \nmean volume fluxes (Sv) standard deviations (Sv)  \nsection \n \nobserved  \nvolume  \nflux (Sv) \nAMM- \nFOAM \nAMM- \nclimate \nAMM- \nNCOM \nAMM- \nNCOM \n(FIC) \nAMM- \nFOAM \nAMM- \nclimate \nAMM- \nNCOM \nAMM- \nNCOM \n(FIC) \n1 Bay of Biscay 45oN       7.91 20.87 23.22 15.81 16.15 12.90 11.83 8.55 \n2 Dover Strait          0.094 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.15 0.15 0.15 0.15 \n3 St George\u2019s Channel              0.14 0.14 0.15 0.14 0.09 0.09 0.10 0.10 \n4 Porcupine Bank (south)     2.34 -1.57 1.70 1.79 3.77 3.25 3.75 4.42 \n5 Porcupine Bank (west)    2.06 1.29 3.95 3.96 2.91 2.46 2.31 2.90 \n6 Porcupine Bank (east)    0.24 0.09 0.11 0.23 0.19 0.49 0.50 0.47 0.46 \n7 Shelf current 57.67oN      1.2\u20132.2 1.62 2.02 1.79 1.76 1.43 1.43 1.34 1.14 \n8 Faeroe to Shetland     4\u20137 2.63 3.72 2.93 2.30 3.33 2.49 1.99 2.12 \n9 Scotland to Orkney             0.04 0.04 0.04 0.04 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.05 \n10 Orkney to Shetland           -0.3 -0.47 -0.48 -0.50 -0.49 0.45 0.44 0.44 0.44 \n11 Shetland to Norway Trench -0.6 -0.81 -0.80 -0.74 -0.80 0.43 0.41 0.41 0.41 \n12 Norway Trench to Norway 1.8 1.33 1.33 1.28 1.34 0.67 0.66 0.65 0.64 \nTable 2 Mean and standard deviations of the daily-mean volume fluxes through the 12 sections (Fig. 1) for four \nmodel runs (Table 1) over 2002 and 2003. All fluxes are in Sverdrups (1Sv = 106m3s-1) with positive values for \nnorth and eastwards fluxes. Observed data for section 2 from Prandle et al. (1996), 6 from Fernand et al. (2006), \n7 and 8 from Huthnance and Gould (1989) and 10, 11 and 12 from Otto et al. (1990) \n \n \n 12 \nThe models all agree on a northwards flux ~1\u20134Sv through section 5, west of Porcupine Bank \nbut the RMS differences are high. All the model runs agree that a much smaller northwards \nflux occurs through the Porcupine Bank (section 6) than further west along the edge of the \ncontinental shelf (section 5). The AMM-NCOM run gives a flux close to the observed \n(0.24Sv, Fernand et al, 2006) and is about twice the values obtained from AMM-FOAM and \nAMM-climate, although all results are highly correlated with one another. \n \nThere is good agreement on the mean flux through section 7 across the shelf edge at 57.67N, \nwith fluxes of 1.6\u20132.0Sv, in accord with observations (1.2\u20132.2Sv inshore of the 2000m \ncontour, Huthnance and Gould, 1989). However, except for the two runs using NCOM \nboundary data, the results are not highly correlated with one another.  The models give a \nmean northwards flux of 2\u20134Sv through the Faeroe to Shetland section (compared with the \nobserved value of 3.8Sv of Atlantic water through the Faeroe-Shetland channel, \u00d8sterhus et \nal, 2005), but again are not highly correlated except for the NCOM runs. The relatively large \nRMS differences (compared to the mean) between the fluxes through sections 7 and 8 show \nthat, even though the mean fluxes compare well with observations, on a day-to-day basis the \nflows are very different. \n \nThe model boundary conditions have little effect on the volume fluxes into the northern North \nSea through the Scotland to Orkney and Orkney to Shetland sections, with mean values in \nclose agreement (0.04Sv and 0.47\u20130.50Sv, respectively). The inflow between Shetland and \nthe 295m contour in the Norwegian Trench (section 11) changes by ~10% depending on the \nboundary condition used. If the 150m contour is used as the eastward end of the section then \nthe volume fluxes are in better agreement with one another (-0.46Sv for all runs), that is, the \nvolume fluxes through the shallower regions are less dependent on which boundary condition \nis used than those through sections that include deeper regions. Incidentally, this gives an \nestimate for the mean southwards volume flux along the western edge of the Norwegian \nTrench of 0.28\u20130.35Sv, compared to the observed value of 0.7-1.11Sv (Otto et al., 1990). The \nnortherly outflow of ~1.3Sv between the 295m-depth contour in the Norwegian Trench and \nthe Norwegian coast (section 12) compares well with the observed value and approximately \nbalances the inflow. The volume fluxes calculated from the model runs are all highly \ncorrelated (correlation coefficients > 0.95) with one another at the four northern North Sea \nsections.  \n \n \nRMS differences (Sv) correlation coefficient  \nsection \nE1\u2013E3 E1\u2013E2 E1\u2013E4 E3\u2013E2 E3\u2013E4 E4\u2013E2 E1\u2013E3 E1\u2013E2 E1\u2013E4 E3\u2013E2 E3\u2013E4 E4\u2013E2 \n1 Bay of Biscay 45oN      22.36 20.77 20.45 14.71 12.22 15.30 0.35 0.39 -0.08 0.31 0.59 0.14 \n2 Dover Strait          0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 \n3 St George\u2019s Channel             0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.98 0.98 0.99 0.98 0.98 0.99 \n4 Porcupine Bank (south)    5.10 5.97 5.62 5.26 4.23 5.65 0.09 0.18 0.07 0.31 0.47 0.33 \n5 Porcupine Bank (west)   4.83 3.10 4.99 4.38 2.26 4.86 -0.44 0.38 -0.26 -0.07 0.64 -0.14 \n6 Porcupine Bank (east)    0.19 0.13 0.16 0.19 0.09 0.18 0.97 0.97 0.97 0.96 0.98 0.95 \n7 Shelf current 57.67oN      0.95 1.12 1.01 0.95 0.56 1.12 0.78 0.73 0.72 0.78 0.91 0.66 \n8 Faeroe to Shetland     3.43 3.67 3.20 2.62 1.00 2.88 0.25 0.30 0.39 0.39 0.93 0.42 \n9 Scotland to Orkney            0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.99 0.99 0.99 0.99 1.00 0.99 \n10 Orkney to Shetland           0.07 0.07 0.07 0.07 0.04 0.07 0.99 0.99 0.99 0.99 1.00 0.99 \n11 Shetland to Norway Trench 0.15 0.13 0.14 0.14 0.09 0.14 0.95 0.96 0.95 0.95 0.98 0.94 \n12 Norway Trench to Norway 0.15 0.15 0.16 0.16 0.10 0.17 0.98 0.98 0.97 0.97 0.99 0.97 \nTable 3 RMS differences between the daily-mean volume fluxes through the 12 sections (Fig. 1) for four model \nruns over 2002 and 2003. E1 is AMM-FOAM, E2 is AMM-climate, E3 is AMM-NCOM and E4 is AMM-\nNCOM(FIC) (Table 1). All fluxes are in Sverdrups (1Sv = 106m3s-1). Also given are the correlation coefficients \nbetween each set of model output with a 99.95% significance level of 0.12 \n \n \n 13\nPlots of the thirty-day running-mean volume fluxes (Fig. 6), calculated from the daily-mean \nvalues for the 12 sections, confirm the good agreement between the four model runs for the \nsections through the shallower regions (sections 2, 3, 9 and 10), and to a lesser extent sections \n11 and 12, which include the deeper regions of the Norwegian Trench. The total inflow \nthrough sections 9\u201311 is correlated with the outwards flux through section 12 with correlation \ncoefficients of 0.93, 0.94, 0.92 and 0.87 for AMM-FOAM, AMM-climate, AMM-NCOM and \nAMM-NCOM(FIC), respectively. The volume fluxes through section 1 in the Bay of Biscay \nshow some agreement between the model runs during 2002 with a minimum flux in the \nsummer but are widely different during 2003.  \n \nComparing the volume fluxes for the two runs forced by NCOM boundary conditions and \nusing different initial conditions shows the regions where the choice of initial condition \nmakes a difference to the model dynamics through the major pathways of the northeast \nAtlantic. On the continental shelf, the effect of the initial condition is small. The shelf current \nat 57.67\u00b0N and the flow along the eastern side of the Faeroe\u2013Shetland channel are both \naffected by the initial condition but the results remain close and are highly correlated. Of the \nsections studied, three \u2013 in the Bay of Biscay (1), and south (4) and west (5) of the Porcupine \nBank \u2013 were greatly affected by the initial condition. These sections cut across the continental \nslope from shallow to deep water, but so do sections 7 and 10, which are less affected by the \ninitial condition so the inclusion of deep water is not the whole reason for the difference. The \nthree sections are all in the southwestern corner of the model and it might be that the \ndynamics of this region are highly dependent on the initial conditions. \n \n \n \nThe AMM-FOAM and AMM-climate runs have in common the elevation and current \nboundary conditions but differ in temperature and salinity boundary and initial conditions. In \naddition to the three southwestern sections which are affected by changing the initial \nconditions alone, the volume fluxes through the eastern side of the Faeroe\u2013Shetland channel \nand, to a lesser extent, the shelf current at 57.67\u00b0N are affected by the change in initial and \nboundary temperature and salinity data. \n \nThe North Atlantic Oscillation is a major mode of variability in the Northern Hemisphere \natmosphere and exerts a strong control on the climate, especially in the winter. For all model \nruns, the monthly-mean volume fluxes through sections 9, 10 and 12 are correlated with the \nmonthly mean NAO index (http:\/\/www.cru.uea.ac.uk\/~timo\/projpages\/nao_update.htm) at the \n99% significance level (r = 0.52). Volume fluxes through the other sections are not correlated \nat that level. Winter mean (December to March) values of the NAO index vary from 0.79 in \n2001\/2002 to 0.40 in 2002\/2003 and -0.2 in 2003\/2004, indicating very different average \nweather conditions over the North Atlantic in 2002 and 2003. For volume fluxes across \nseveral of the sections crossing deeper water, particularly section 8, the AMM-climate run \ndisplays a strong seasonal signal repeated in 2002 and 2003, which is absent in the other \nmodel runs (Fig. 6). The climate temperature and salinity boundary conditions are missing \ninformation on inter-annual variability that exists in the FOAM and NCOM models and this \nappears to impact on the fluxes in the deeper regions of the model.  \n \n 14 \nFi\ng. 6 AMM 30-day running mean volume fluxes normal to the sections shown in Fig. 1 from AMM-FOAM \n(black solid lines), AMM-NCOM (green solid lines), AMM-climate (blue dashed lines) and AMM-NCOM(FIC) \n(red dashed lines). Positive values denote fluxes towards the north and east \n \n3.3. Sea surface height (SSH) fields \n \nSatellite altimetry data provides another useful source of model validation information, which \nin deep, non-tidally stirred waters, through a geostrophic relationship can be related \napproximately to the surface currents. Using elevation data output at hourly intervals, average \nsea surface height (SSH) fields for the final two years of the simulations (2002\u20132003) are \nconstructed for each model run. The effect of atmospheric pressure is removed by using the \ninverse barometer relationship. The SSH along each section in Fig. 1 is calculated and, for \neach section and each model run, the mean SSH along the section is subtracted so that all \nlines are plotted around a zero mean (Fig. 7).   \n \nThe modelled SSH are in close agreement with each other for all of the sections on the shelf, \nshowing that the choice of boundary condition has little affect on the mean SSH here, where \nthe tidal signal tends to dominate. The shape of the sea surface determines the geostrophic \ncurrents in the upper ocean and the agreement between the models reinforces the volume flux \nresults (Fig. 6).  Four of the sections along the shelf edge \u2013 in the Bay of Biscay (1), east of \nPorcupine Bank (6), the shelf current (7) and the Faeroe-Shetland current (8) \u2013 also show \nclose agreement between the model SSHs, an indication that the large-scale upper-level \ngeostrophic flow along the shelf edge is not strongly affected by the choice of boundary \ncondition. Sections 4 and 5, south and west of Porcupine Bank, show more scatter between \nthe different model runs. The AMM-climate results are most different from the other runs and \n 15\nthis might be due to an inconsistency in mixing climate temperature and salinity boundary \nconditions with FOAM elevation and current boundary conditions.   \n \nThe model results are compared to mean absolute sea level (Fig. 7) for 1992-2002, calculated \nfrom GRACE satellite data, drifter and wind fields (Niiler et al., 2003; Maximenko and Niiler, \n2005). The satellite data are on a 0.5\u00b0 resolution global grid and there are no data near land for \nsections 2, 3, 9, 10 and 12. As for the model data, the along-section mean is subtracted for \neach section. Except for section 5, west of Porcupine Bank, and the AMM-climate results in \nthe section south of Porcupine Bank (4), there is general agreement between the modelled and \nobserved sea levels. The model results and satellite data agree well for the two sections \nthrough the Bay of Biscay (1) and the Faeroe-Shetland current (8). For the section through the \nshelf current (7) both models and observations show a gentle slope at the western end, \nincreasing around 8.5\u20139\u00b0W and reducing further east, although in the eastern part of the \nsection the slope of the model sea surface is much greater than the observed. \n \n \nFig. 7 Comparison of observed and modelled mean sea surface height (cm) along the sections shown in Fig. 1. \nAMM-FOAM (black solid line), AMM-NCOM (green solid line), AMM-NCOM(FIC) (red dashed line), AMM-\nclimate (blue dashed line) and satellite-derived (black dotted line) data. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 16 \n3.4. Tracers \n \nTo investigate the on-shelf flux of material, passive tracer transport is calculated in the model \nruns. At 0 hours on the 1st January 2002, a tracer was released into the model domain in each \nrun. The tracer was given the value of 100m-3 and placed throughout the water column \nwherever the undisturbed water depth in the model was greater than 2000m. This is in three \nregions \u2013 the whole of the southwestern corner of the model, into the Bay of Biscay and \nextending northwards into the Rockall Trough, the area between ~14\u201320\u00b0W and 59\u201362\u00b0N (the \neastern edge of the Iceland basin) and the deep region near the northern boundary (the \nsouthern Norwegian Sea). The tracer is passive but allowed to advect and diffuse with the \nmodel flow. \n \nSix months after release, the tracer has in all cases been transported along the edge of the \ncontinental shelf to north of the Shetland Islands (Fig. 8a). The current that flows into the \nNorth Sea between Orkney and Shetland is clearly visible and, for the AMM-FOAM and \nAMM-climate runs, the tracer has been transported further along the shelf edge and is \nbeginning to turn southwards down the western edge of the Norwegian Trough. None of the \nmodel runs show evidence of cross-slope transport from the Bay of Biscay onto the shelf \nregion west of France but all show that there is flow onto the shelf to the west of Ireland and \nwest and north of Scotland. Only a small amount of tracer has been transported into the \ncentral and southern North Sea, the Irish Sea and the Celtic Sea. The AMM-FOAM and \nAMM-climate runs have transported tracer further north along the coast of Norway than the \ntwo runs forced with NCOM boundary data. The same two model runs transport tracer from \nthe Iceland Basin eastwards over the Iceland\u2013Faeroe ridge and north of the Faeroe Islands, a \nflow that is also absent in the NCOM-forced runs. The AMM-FOAM run has retained the \ntracer in the region of deep water near the northern boundary of the model, in the other three \nmodels the tracer has been transported away.  \n \nTwo years after release (Fig. 8b), the tracer has reached most of the model domain. The \nAMM-FOAM and AMM-climate results show evidence of stronger northwards flow along \nthe edge of the continental shelf as much more tracer has reached the area west of Norway \nthan in the models forced with NCOM boundary data. Significantly higher concentrations of \ntracer have been advected northwards by the AMM-FOAM model than the AMM-climate \nmodel. There is also much less mixing of the tracer in the southwest corner of the domain in \nAMM-climate. The details of the density structure of the boundary conditions have a large \nimpact on the transport of the tracer in the deeper water and impacting onto the shelf region. \nAll of the models show cross-slope transport of the tracer to the west of France, into the \nEnglish Channel and through the Dover Strait. Tracer has now entered the Irish Sea but the \nwater around Ireland and in the southern North Sea still has much lower concentrations than \nmost other regions. \n \n 17\n  \n \nFig. 8a Extent of the tracer concentration at the sea surface six months after release. Tracer of value 100m-3 was \nreleased on 1st January 2002 in regions where the depth is greater than 2000m. The black solid line is the 2000m \nisobath. The black dashed line is the 150m isobath representing the extent of the shelf area.

Discussion \n \nTwo operational ocean models covering the northeast Atlantic provide boundary and initial \nconditions for a regional model of the Atlantic Margin (AMM). To investigate the value to the \nregional model of using boundary conditions from the ocean models, a hybrid data set \ncomprising temperature and salinity climatologies and current and elevations from one of the \nmodels (FOAM) is also used to force the AMM. \n \nThe results of the Atlantic Margin model compare well with observations of sea surface \ntemperature. On the shelf, the sea surface temperature errors of the two runs using NCOM \nboundary data but differing initial conditions suggest that, after 15 months of model time, the \neffect of the temperature and salinity initial conditions is negligible and the model dynamics \nand meteorological forcing have become dominant. When the deeper regions of the Atlantic \nMargin domain are included in the comparison, the density-related boundary conditions \nbecome important and the NCOM boundary conditions give smaller RMS errors than the \nFOAM boundary conditions. The run using climate data temperature and salinity boundary \nand initial conditions gave the smallest SST errors when calculated over the whole domain. In \ncontrast to the statistics, there is some evidence from spatial plots of SST in the AMM-climate \nrun of a too-strong northwards current near 15\u201320\u00b0W, 45\u201350\u00b0N, which is not evident in the \nsatellite observation or the results of the model runs using FOAM and NCOM data. \n \nOn the northwest European continental shelf, volume fluxes through sections placed across \nstrategic pathways appear mostly unaffected by the initial and boundary conditions used by \nthe AMM. All model runs produced results consistent with observations. For sections that \na b \n 18 \nextended into deeper water off the continental shelf, the volume flux depended heavily on \nboth the boundary and initial data sources. The affect was largest for the two sections in the \nsouthwest corner of the model domain and there is evidence that the run using climate data \nbehaves differently from the runs using model output as boundary data. This might be a \nconsequence of the lower temporal and spatial resolution of the climate data that misses some \ndetail of the density field that is important for the correct modelling of the large-scale \ncurrents, or it might be that the climate temperature and salinity boundary conditions are \ninconsistent with the FOAM elevation and barotropic current data that are used to complete \nthe boundary data set for the AMM-climate run. There appears to be no consistent difference \nbetween the models in the variabilities of the volume fluxes through the selected cross-\nsections when considering the standard deviations of the daily-mean data (table 2). \n \nBy the balance between the pressure gradient and the Coriolis force, currents tend to be \nconstrained to follow depth contours (Huthnance, 1995), on timescales longer than one day. \nThis inhibits ocean-shelf exchanges in regions of steep bathymetry. Since POLCOMS is run \nwithout assimilation and is forced by the analysis of atmospheric and oceanic operational \nmodels, the AMM simulations are equivalent to \u2018nowcasts\u2019 in an operational system (rather \nthan a forecast). The internal variability (and hence the predictability) of the circulation of \nthese shelf seas is constrained strongly by the topography, shape of the shelf-sea basin and the \nlocation of fronts. Consequently, the shallow shelf region of the northeast Atlantic is largely \nunaffected by the choice of boundary condition in the AMM.  \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe thank Ruth Preller and Pam Posey of the Naval Research Laboratory, Stennis Space Center, USA for \nsupplying the NCOM data and Martin Holt of the UK Met Office for supplying the FOAM data.
