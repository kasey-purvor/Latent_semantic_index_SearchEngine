If health services are to engage with groups that are deemed \u2018hard to  \n \nreach\u2019 and marginalised from mainstream health services, the experiences and  \n \npractices for engagement from within the VCS may serve as useful lessons for service  \n \nimprovement for statutory health services. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBackground \n \nThe notion \u2018hard to reach\u2019 is a contested and ambiguous term [1] that is  \n \ncommonly used within the spheres of social care and health, especially in discourse  \n \naround health and social inequalities.    \nReducing inequalities in health and health provision is a key theme underpinning the \nNHS Plan and National Service Framework\u2019 [2]. This same report acknowledged that \ncertain groups are marginalized from services and therefore \u2018harder to reach\u2019 for \nhealth services whose goal is to provide appropriate and equitable health care for all \npopulations. The Framework stated that primary care has a significant role to play in \nproviding services that reach those in the greatest need but a Home Office report in \n2004 [3] described the \u2018hard-to-reach\u2019 as \u2018inaccessible to most traditional and \nconventional methods for any reason.\u2019. On the other hand, voluntary and community \norganisations (VCOs) are considered \u2018uniquely placed to reach marginalised groups\u2019 \n[4] and the \u2018hardest to reach\u2019 [5], and play an important role in the provision of health \nand social care services for these groups [6]. \n \nThis paper describes the first stage of a planned study aimed at improving \nunderstanding of the \u2018hard to reach\u2019 and improving access to primary health services \n 4 \nfor \u2018hard to reach\u2019 groups.  Acknowledgement of the established role of the Voluntary \nand Community Sector in providing services for these groups informed a decision to \nbegin the study by exploring the perceptions and experiences of organisations from \nthis sector.  \n \nThis first stage of the study had two research objectives \u2013  \no To describe how service providers from the voluntary and community sector \n(VCS) conceive of the notion \u2018hard to reach\u2019. \no To explore perceptions of the barriers and facilitators to accessing services for  \n\u2018hard to reach\u2019 groups.  \n \n \nUsing the search terms: \u2018hard to reach populations\u2019  \u2018hidden populations\u2019,  \n\u2018marginalized populations\u2019, a literature search was conducted using the following  \ndatabases: Books @ Ovid, Journal @ Ovid Full text, British Nursing Index (BNI),  \nCAB Abstracts (1973-2006), CINAHL, EMBASE, Ovid Medline, PSYCINFO,  \nSociological Abstracts and Web of Science.  Searches were restricted to English- \nlanguage papers and limited from 1997 to present day. A search of the grey literature  \nwas also conducted using the Home Office and Department of Health websites. A  \nGoogle search was undertaken limited to last 12 months using the term \u2018hard to reach  \nGroups.\u2019 \nDespite the apparent familiarity of the term and its use in social research and public  \npolicy, there would appear to be a lack of consensus about the meaning of the term.  \nWithin the literature, \u2018hard to reach\u2019 is often synonymised with other terms and the  \nsheer multiplicity of alternatives reflects the divergence in the discourse as well as the  \n 5 \ndifficulty in arriving at a definitive description of its meaning.  \u2018Vulnerable\u2019, \ntransient\u2019 [7] \u2018marginalised\u2019  \u2018refusers\u2019 [8], \u2018hidden\u2019 [9], \u2018forgotten populations\u2019 [10], \n\u2018underserved\u2019 [11], \u2018special populations\u2019 [12] \u2018disadvantaged populations\u2019 [13] are \nterms that have all been utilised in the literature pertaining to addressing issues faced \nby the \u2018hard to reach\u2019, or indeed those who are trying to reach them.  \nThere was an overarching sense that trying to engage the \u2018hard to reach\u2019 is \nproblematic, as described almost two decades ago by Freimuth & Mettger [14](1990) \nand this may be due to the inherent ambiguity and lack of clarity of definition. \nAssignation of the term appears largely dependent upon the context of the \norganisation doing the reaching.    \n \nThe \u2018hard to reach\u2019 groups most commonly identified in the literature are sex workers, \ndrug users, people living with HIV and people from lesbian, gay, bisexual, \ntransgender and intersex communities [15,16,17], but there are a number of other \ngroups to which the description applies including asylum seekers, refugees, black and \nminority ethnic communities (BME), children  and young people, disabled people, \nelderly people [18]  and traveller families [19]. The \u2018hard to reach\u2019 may be people \nwho are stigmatised due to the fact they are perceived as being somehow different.    \n \nIf we think in terms of stigma and social exclusion in a healthcare context, the \u2018hard \nto reach\u2019 may include people with a variety of conditions or life limiting illnesses. \nThis may include people with congenital abnormalities [20] or genetic conditions \n[21]; people with hearing loss [22]; people with mental health problems [23],[24]. \nIt is important to address also the notion that there are populations who are deemed \n\u2018hard to reach\u2019 but who are \u2018non-associative\u2019; that is they do not generally associate \n 6 \nwith other members [25]. These populations are comparatively under-researched and \nit is acknowledged that trying to gain access to disparate and often isolated \nindividuals, although labour intensive, is an important area of consideration for \nresearchers and indeed service providers working with the \u2018hard to reach.\u2019 \n \n\u2018Hard to reach\u2019 audiences have been defined as \u2018inaccessible to most traditional and \nconventional methods for any reason\u2019 [3], highlighting the difficulty facing statutory \nhealth care provision. The voluntary and community sector has arguably been more \nsuccessful in penetrating some of the barriers for the \u2018hard to reach\u2019 and has an \nimportant role to play in the understanding of service delivery provision.    \n \nThere are around half a million voluntary and community organisations (VCOs) in the \nUK and there is a long tradition of voluntary action and community service in this \ncountry [4]. They have been used increasingly to deliver public services, especially \nover the last ten years [26,27,28].  \nThe VCS is a term used to describe self-governing organisations working in areas of  \npublic benefit and they are \u2018value-driven\u2019 in that they \u2018exist for the good of the  \ncommunity\u2019 [29]. They can range in size from small community based groups or \nprojects to large national and international organisations. \nAs the term suggests, these services often rely upon volunteers for service provision  \nand delivery and are characterised by their independence from the \u2018formal structures \nof government and the profit sector\u2019.  \n 7 \nHowever, in practice it appears that the sector \u2018defies easy definition\u2019 [30] and it is \nsuggested that the inherent ambiguity and variation in terms of how various \norganisations define and describe themselves is the very reason they are able to \nprovide such diversity and flexibility. \nResearch Objectives \nThe aim of the study was to explore \u2018hard to reach\u2019- from the experiences and \nperspectives of the VCS.  The findings would contribute to a larger study considering \nhow these maybe translated to provision of services in primary health care. \nThe specific objectives of the work described in this paper were:  \no To describe how service providers from the voluntary and community sector \n(VCS) conceive of the notion \u2018hard to reach\u2019. \no To explore perceptions of the barriers and facilitators to accessing services for  \n\u2018hard to reach\u2019 groups.  \n \n \nMethods \n \nThis study utilised a qualitative design, since qualitative methods are well placed to  \n \nexplore sensitive and relatively poorly understood aspects of social life [31]. Semi- \n \nstructured interviews were conducted with purposefully sampled team leaders or  \n \npractitioners from VCS organisations across Birmingham.  \n \nPurposive sampling or criterion based sampling [32,33] was used to enable \nrecruitment of participants who have particular experiences and roles that are \npertinent to the study objectives.  \n  \nThe Birmingham Index of Voluntary Organisations was employed to access details of \n \norganisations working with \u2018hard to reach groups\u2019. Letters of invitation were sent to  \n \n30 organisations and these were followed up by a telephone call, introducing the  \n 8 \n \nresearcher and offering further details about the project. The organisations contacted  \n \nincluded services working with people with mental health problems; homeless and  \n \npoorly housed people; problem drug users, people identifying as gay, lesbian, bi- \n \nsexual and transgender; parents of young children in disadvantaged areas; people  \n \nfrom BME communities; people working as carers; older adults; people with learning  \n \ndifficulties. These organisations were contacted as the groups they worked with  \n \nare described in the literature pertaining to stigmatised, marginalised or hard to reach  \n \ngroups [23,34,15,17,34,35,36,37,38]. \n \nThe initial plan was to interview service leads or managers as it was felt that  \n \nthey may be in the best position to give both an overview of their services, as well as   \n \nproviding accounts of front-line experience. However, it was not always  \n \npossible to interview team leads, and participation was delegated by the service  \n \nmanager\/ team leads to other practitioners from within the projects, who in all but  \n \none case held a management role of some kind within the project. \n \nEight services agreed to participate and the organisations worked with the following  \n \ngroups \u2013 young people, members of the Irish community, homeless people, people  \n \nfrom BME communities living with HIV and people from the lesbian, gay and  \n \ntransgender communities, families and carers of drug users, young homeless people  \n \nand people with mental health problems. The organisations that declined to  \n \nparticipate cited time restrictions as their reason for non-participation. \n \nThe literature review on \u2018hard to reach groups\u2019 informed the development of the topic \nguide for the semi structured interviews. The topic guide covered the following areas:  \n\u2022 remit of your organisation and the client group you work.  \n\u2022 Experience of working  with this group\/ in this field. \n\u2022 Understanding of the term hard to reach. \n 9 \n\u2022 Who do you regard as \u2018hard to reach\u2019? \n\u2022 Why is it difficult to reach these groups? Why do you think they don\u2019t come? \n\u2022 What  measures have been put in place to engage the \u2018hard to reach\u2019? \n\u2022 Examples of successes in engaging the \u2018hard to reach\u2019. \n \nEthical approval was sought and obtained from the university ethics committee. IRAS \napproval was not required as no NHS patients or employees were interviewed.    \nAll interviews took place at the participants\u2019 place of work. All Participants agreed for \nthe interviews to be audio-recorded and signed a consent form to reflect this.  \n Recorded interviews were transcribed by SF and each transcript was checked for any  \n \nerrors or omissions. Each manuscript was read and the emerging themes and key  \n \npoints were highlighted. Transcripts were analysed by both authors to ensure  \n \nreliability of interpretation of the results. Labels and categories are used to \u2018organise  \n \nand analyse the data\u2019 [32] by assigning key themes and emerging concepts to the raw  \n \ndata. This thematic approach to analysis provides a focus on the identifiable themes  \n \nand patterns that emerge from the raw data. \n \nThree broad areas emerged which include the following  \n \no How the term \u2018hard to reach\u2019 is defined \n \no What barriers the \u2018hard to reach\u2019 face in accessing services. \n \no What can be done to engage \u2018the hard to reach\u2019 \n \n \nEach of these broad themes comprised a number of categories which are discussed  \n \nbelow. Quotations have been used throughout to add power to participants\u2019  \n \naccounts, and to encapsulate the views and experiences of individual participants  \n \n[39]. \n 10 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nResults \n \nHow the term \u2018hard to reach\u2019 is defined \nTwo respondents alluded to the apparent familiarity of the term \u2018hard to reach\u2019, for \nexample, \u201cone of those terms that people bandy about\u201d while also indicating their  \nunease with it. As one respondent explained (R5): \u201cThe problem I have with the term  \nis that I don\u2019t really feel as if groups are actually hard to reach.\u201d before going on to \nsuggest that it would be better to \u201cfind some other terminology to explain [it].\u201d  \nThe term was attributed to describe the service (non) user and attributed to \u2018services\u2019 \nthemselves. \n \nThe unengaged \u2013 non users of services \nThere was an overall sense here that one conception of the \u2018hard to reach\u2019 refers to the  \npeople who are not seen in services.  The \u201cunengaged\u201d was used to by one respondent \nto refer to those \u201cwho don\u2019t come to see us\u201d (R1).  Two other respondents described \nthem as; \u201cgroups and communities who aren\u2019t accessing a particular service for \nwhatever reason\u201d (R5) and those who \u201ctraditionally wouldn\u2019t seek support from the \nusual avenues\u201d (R6).   \nIt is suggested that there are certain characteristics pertaining to how we may \ncommonly define the notion of the \u2018hard to reach\u2019:  \nPeople that would generally have difficulty accessing services\u2026  \nyounger and more vulnerable people\u2026 you are talking about people  \nwho are more deprived, who are less well educated\u2026 may have  \n 11 \nrestrictions placed upon them by society generally or their more  \nnarrow social group. (R1) \nThis respondent further intimated that this does not tell the whole story and \nacknowledged in the context of providing a service for young people that the \u201cwhite  \nmiddle classes\u201d may lead \u201ccontrolled lives\u201d that may inhibit them accessing particular  \nservices. This alternative explanation of the meaning of the term; the sense that the  \nterm \u2018hard to reach\u2019 can refer to those inhabiting a more privileged section of society  \n[40,41] is an issue that is not raised in the remaining interviews but is worthy of note.   \nMore commonly we found that the responses support the sense that the \u2018hard to reach\u2019 \nare in some ways more needy; more marginalized; more likely to have experienced \npoverty, whether that be economic poverty or poverty of opportunity [7,19,8,9]. \nLack of choice is another feature that was used to explain why a group maybe \u2018hard to  \nreach\u2019 \u2013 \nYou don\u2019t have those choices\u2026 \neither you can\u2019t afford them because you\u2019ve  \ngot limited income and you haven\u2019t got the  \ninformation either to be able to make an informed  \nchoice (R7)  \n \n \nThe transgender community is also particularly stigmatised [42]. The Diagnostic and  \n \nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) includes \u2018Gender Identity Disorder\u2019 as  \n \na category and this \u2018continues to raise questions of consistency, validity, and fairness\u2019   \n \n[43]. To help overcome this, the project employs a transgender doctor to help engage  \n \nwith members of the transgender community. \n \n \n 12 \n \n\u2018Hard to reach\u2019 understood from a service and societal stance \nIt is difficult to define the \u2018hard to reach\u2019 without thinking of the wider societal issues  \nthat contribute to or create such conditions. Service restrictions and limitations may \nmean that it is the services themselves that are \u2018hard to reach.\u2019 \nOne respondent alluded to the sense that it may be the way that an organisation is  \nconfigured that creates this notion of the \u2018hard to reach\u2019 and she stated that the term  \ncan mean \u201cpeople to whom we put up some barriers\u201d - \nit makes it sound like the fault of the non  \nservice-user \u2013 \u201cyou are hard to reach\u201d \u2013 like  \nthey are sat up on a shelf and we have got to lure  \nthem down with biscuits, or something\u2026.  \nactually if you just got a ladder and sat next to them  \nthat would be fine. (R1) \n \nOther ways of describing this were given in terms of \u2018hard to reach\u2019 individuals \nhaving \u201cfallen through the net\u201d (R7) or being \u201cleft out of the loop.\u201d This suggests a \nsense that certain groups or individuals are being excluded from services and this is \nthe fault of the services themselves - \norganisations in the mainstream don\u2019t know \u2026 \nhow to reach them, how to engage them in activities,  \ndon\u2019t know where to find certain people. (R2) \nThese people have in some way been let down by the system:  \n    \u201cfor whatever circumstances [they]  have been through  \nthe system and have either failed the system of the  \n 13 \nsystem has failed them.\u201d (R3) \nOne respondent made explicit the sense that the term is inappropriately attributed  \nto groups and communities [18]. Instead, he stated that \u201cit is about looking at our own \nservices and looking at why individuals aren\u2019t engaging.   \n \nR6 suggested his organisation aims to engage   \nthe hardest to reach people who traditionally wouldn\u2019t  \nseek support from the usual avenues and traditionally  \nhadn\u2019t succeeded very well in either society or within  \nthe education system.  \nTwo key points are raised here; firstly of somebody being on the margins of what is \nconsidered to be the mainstream of society and secondly, a sense that the reason for \nthis maybe due to a failure in the system. \nThis sentiment is developed and made more explicit later when the respondent  \nintimates that the problem may be systemic \u2013 \nIt\u2019s just about pushing them in that direction  \nand perhaps that\u2019s where our school education  \ndoesn\u2019t quite serve everybody as well as it should.  \nThis respondent also stated that \u201cwe are very good at stereotyping and boxing  \npeople in\u201d and he uses a quotation from a service user to demonstrate this notion:  \nI am not \u201chard to reach\u201d, generally people don\u2019t  \nknow how to reach me. \n \n \n \nBarriers and Facilitators to Services \n \nIn order to understand how appropriate services can be offered to the \u2018hard to reach\u2019,   \n 14 \n \nthe experiences of VCS services providers in providing services to these groups were  \n \nexplored. Service providers were asked to describe the kinds of barriers they face in  \n \noffering services to \u2018hard to reach\u2019 clients, as well as the factors that helped to  \n \nfacilitate the engagement of these groups.  \n \n \nBarriers \n \nPrevious experiences of accessing services \n \nA number of participants made explicit reference to the fact that many potential  \n \nservice users may not engage because of their previous experiences of accessing  \n \nservices. In particular, it would seem that statutory services were conceived  \n \nas being particularly impenetrable [44], thus discouraging individuals to access help. \n \nThe sense that such experiences may begin in the formative years is indicated by one  \n \nrespondent who suggested that the \u201cexperience of the education system as being quite  \n \nnegative\u201d (R6) is likely to have an impact upon future expectations. \n \n \nPhysical Factors \n \nThere are logistical factors to be considered that may serve as barriers to accessing  \n \nservices, including factors such as location and opening times.  \n \nOne respondent indicated that \u201cgeography and transport\u201d were barriers to services, but  \n \nalso the fact that young people may be conscious of gang boundaries:  \n \nquite a lot of young people aren\u2019t sure if it is ok \n \nfor them to go to certain places. (R1) \n \nA similar point was made by R7 who explained that their particular project  \n \nmoved location from the middle of an estate because:  \n \na lot of young people wouldn\u2019t use it, because  \n   \nit is all territorial. \n 15 \n \nAnother respondent (R7) suggested that geography may be a barrier to accessing  \n \nservices as potential service users \u201cdon\u2019t know we are here.\u201d  \n \nHowever, once people become aware of the location and are engaged in the service,  \n \nlimitations can arise in terms of how many people can be accommodated. By  \n \nbecoming victims of their own success, organisations may inadvertently exclude some  \n \n more needy but less vocal members of their target audience. This idea is encapsulated  \n \nby this quotation from R1; \n \nthe worry is that when you are very busy\u2026  \n \nit\u2019s the more vulnerable that you squeeze out. \n \n \nFunding and Partnership working \n \nA common issue raised by a number of respondents concerns the way that VCS  \n \norganisations are funded [45]. These broad areas of concern were based  \n \naround the fact the organisations have to vie for different pots of money to provide  \n \nspecific services for the particular remit of client group.  \n \nA similar issue was raised by one respondent who suggested that there may be a fear  \n \nof competition amongst partner organisations culminating in the concern that -  \n \nthey are going to steal my clients. What service  \n \n am I going to be left to run? (R4) \n \n \n \nThere was also a concern that excessive attention is given to those things that are  \n \neasier to measure at the expense of those things that were harder to quantify. \n \nFurthermore, some \u2018causes\u2019 are perceived as more worthy resulting in  \n \nlarger funding pools for certain projects. One respondent describes the inequity in  \n \naccessing project funding for lesbians:  \n \n 16 \nIf you work in BME communities, or people  \n \nwith HIV, it can be a lot easier to get funding.( R4) \n \nDespite a good deal of praise for the practice of partnership working (see below) one  \n \nrespondent drew attention to its potentially problematic nature, stating that co- \n \nworking or partnership working may be perceived as synonymous with \u201cextra work\u201d \n \nand therefore maybe avoided. \n \n \n \nAttitudes and constraints of the statutory services towards the VCS \n \nThree of the respondents were explicit in their concerns around the relationship  \n \nbetween themselves and statutory sector organisations. \n \nOne expressed concern about the attitude held by the statutory sector towards the  \n \nVCS. He suggested that the use of the term \u2018third sector\u2019 with reference to the VCS  \n \nreinforces a view that this sector is somehow of less value: \n \nthe image  the statutory sector has of the  \n \nvoluntary sector is \u2018there, there nice little  \n \norganisations. You do your specialist thing  \n \nand leave us to do the professional work. (R3) \n \n \nOne respondent made explicit their frustrations with the statutory sector suggesting  \n \nthat social services are not equipped to deal with the complexity of problems faced by  \n \nsome young people:  \n \nif that young person doesn\u2019t co-operate, for  \n \nwhatever reason, then they\u2019re [social services] \n \n not interested and the young person is left high and dry. (R7) \n \nProblems of access are also faced by the VCS themselves:  \n \nas an agency, it\u2019s also difficult to access these  \n 17 \n \nservices on behalf of young people, especially when  \n \nthe average user will have more than one, like sort of,  \n \nspecial need. (R7) \n \n \nExpectations\/limitations of services \n \nExpectations or preconceptions of the VCS services may also become a barrier in  \n \nterms of accessing \u2018hard to reach\u2019 groups. This is encapsulated by one respondent,  \n \n who states:  \n \nit is about ourselves, the expectations that  \n  \n  you must come to us.(R5) \n \nIt is suggested that for a service that is dominated by clients from a more  \n \nnarrow demographic this can become a barrier for potential service users who may  \n \nfeel like \u201coutsiders\u201d (R3). Even within services for the \u2018hard to reach\u2019 there is a hard  \n \ncore of individuals who do not access services. In some homeless day centres, for  \n \nexample, where the client group are predominantly white men, then women and  \n \npeople from other ethnic groups may feel more reluctant to utilise the service. \n \nFurthermore, the views held by some clients about other service users can contribute  \n \nto the difficulties faced by service providers in serving diverse groups:  \n \nwe see individuals coming in with a very blinkered  \n \nview about some of the service users that we see, maybe  \n \nrefugees \u2013 \u201cwhy are they over here stealing our jobs? (R4) \n \n \n \nFacilitators \n \nAs described, there are a number of perceived barriers in terms of providing  \n \nservices to the \u2018hard to reach.\u2019 Conversely, a number of facilitators in providing  \n \n 18 \naccessible services to the difficult to engage were cited.  \n \nTreatment of Clients \u2013 trust, respect  \n \nA perception that service users have been poorly treated by other services, and in  \n \nparticular by statutory service has already been raised.  \n \nThe most commonly cited facilitator for engaging clients was the way VCS services  \n \ncommunicate with and treat clients.  \n \nThis key theme is illustrated by the following quotations from R1:  \n \nwe don\u2019t interrogate clients when they come here.  \n  \nWe ask what questions we need to give them the service  \n \nthey want. (R1) \n \nReference is also made to the attention paid to the attitude of the staff members:  \n \nI think the important thing is to spend an  \n \nawful lot of time and effort on making sure  \n \nthat staff are genuinely welcoming and non-judgmental  \n \nabout absolutely everyone that walks through the door. (R1) \n \nThe quality of the relationship that develops between staff and service user is a major  \n \nfactor in engaging clients; building trust and respect; being non-judgmental and  \n \nbeing able to relate to and empower people.  \n \n \nOk, you can trust us, but it is very much about  \n \nthem being able to recognise that they can trust us,  \n \nor build up that relationship which can take weeks. (R3) \n \nFlexibility \n \nOffering flexible services that respond to the needs of the service users including  \n \nrunning outreach services, listening to feedback, offering flexible opening hours and  \n \nproviding service users with the kinds of services they want were all key facilitators  \n 19 \n \ncited by the respondents. \n \nOne respondent made the point that although they are not as \u201cflexible as we would  \n \nlike,\u201d many of the people using this service are  \n \nvery much on the peripheries of normal society\u2026  \n \na lot of people on benefits \u2026so they can come as  \n \nand when. (R4) \n \nFurthermore, by offering an outreach service to encourage potential service users to  \n \nengage, they are able to access people who may not ordinarily feel comfortable to  \n \nattending a HIV service. Not all the organisations interviewed conducted outreach and  \n \nthis was largely due to resource limitations. There appeared to be a tension between  \n \noffering a service to all the target audience, including those \u2018harder to reach\u2019 clients  \n \nand being able to provide an adequate service to all. \n \nOffering services that people want is a key facilitator for engagement. One respondent   \n \ndescribed how changing their opening times as well as offering service users a hot  \n \nmeal had resulted in a fifty per cent increase in demand for the service (R3). \n \n \nPartnership Working \n \nAs described above there are a number of drawbacks to partnership working that can  \n \nbe perceived as barriers to service participation. However, there are also a number of  \n \npositive aspects to working in partnership and it seemed to be a priority for a number  \n \nof the organisations. \n \nOne respondent makes the point that working in partnership is actively encouraged by  \n \nthe funding bodies who support organisations.  \n \nPartnerships can be useful in assisting in:  \n \ngetting information out there, and ensuring  \n \n 20 \nthat people know who we are. (R4)  \n \n \nAcknowledgement of the limitations of a service was also important:  \n \n \nwe don\u2019t claim to know everything. We don\u2019t  \n \nwant to do everything. It isn\u2019t possible to do everything  \n \nreally, really well, but what you can do is build very, very  \n \nstrong partnerships with other organisations that do  \n \nspecialise in particular areas. (R5) \n \nUser involvement \n \nFor some of the respondents, emphasis was placed upon the importance of user  \n \nparticipation. Service participation and interview panels were conducted at one  \n \norganisation throughout  the year. \u201cMember helpers\u201d or trainee volunteers form part  \n \nof the team with the aim to build the esteem and skills of the service users. Using  \n \nservice users as part of the team encourages other clients to participate and feel more  \n \nsettled:  \n \nIt\u2019s about having a different relationship. A service \n \n user can better describe it [how it feels to be a service \n \n user]. They can share that with each other, use that  \n \nas a bridging gap and a way of opening doors. (R3) \n \n \nThe kinds of relationships the VCS is able to develop with their clients is of the kind  \n \nthat is often found wanting in statutory services. The emphasis they place on user  \n \ninvolvement and use of volunteers as demonstrated above can act as an enabler for  \n \nthose they seek to serve.  \n \nDiscussion \n \nThe VCS a model for the NHS? \n 21 \n \nAs we have seen, tackling health inequalities is a top priority for the Government and  \n \npart of this includes engaging those \u2018seldom seen, seldom heard\u2019 in services. \n \nRecent Department of Health initiatives have highlighted the need for improved  \n \nservice provision  and configuration. The NHS Next Stage Review Interim Report  \n \n[46] reported that despite \u2018sustained investment and improvement in the NHS over  \n \nthe past 10 years, access to primary medical care and services and quality of those  \n \nservices continues to vary significantly across the country.\u2019 (pp 3) \n \nAs noted by a number of the respondents, the importance of listening to the voices of  \n \nusers has been taken onboard by the NHS as a key resource in providing appropriate  \n \nservices [47]. Already, changes in how health services, and in particular primary care  \n \nservices, are delivered seem to bear the hallmarks of VCS practice, but there is a need  \n \nto go further. Some of the changes in provision of GP services aimed at improving  \n \npatient access and experience include the introduction of patient feedback and quality  \n \nassessment (surveying patients about their local GP practice); the extension of  \n \nopening hours to accommodate the varying lifestyles of patient populations and thus  \n \nengaging with the \u2018seldom seen\u2019. As we have seen the VCS ability to offer flexibility  \n \nin terms of opening hours and responsive services for service users are cited as  \n \nfacilitators for the more difficult to engage. \n \n \nThe Department of Health acknowledges the need to \u2018establish effective links with  \n \nfrontline services, utilising the potential of VCF sector agencies as valuable catalysts  \n \nfor dialogue, mutual understanding and empowerment [48] (pp4).  \n \nPartnership working is becoming increasingly important to the health service. \n \nFrom the perspective of primary care provision it is acknowledged that as  \n \ncommissioners of services,  Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) working alongside local  \n \n 22 \nauthorities should \u2018identify specific communities with particularly poor health, such  \n \nas travellers, migrant workers, people with learning disabilities, those living in  \n \ndisadvantaged areas or demographic groups\u2019 [49]. \n \nIt seems that the NHS is moving in the right direction in terms of offering choice  \n \nand a voice to patients. Before equity in health services can be fully realised that work  \n \nmust continue in engaging the most excluded and \u2018hard to reach\u2019 in society. \n \n \n \n \n \nStudy Limitations \n \nThe study is clearly limited by the small sample size. Most qualitative studies will aim  \n \nto interview between twenty and thirty people although the aim is to continue data  \n \ncollection until data saturation is met. This is the point were no further themes are  \n \nbeing generated.  Unfortunately, only eight out of the thirty organisations felt they had  \n \nthe time to participate. It could be postulated that organisations providing services for  \n \nmore marginal groups are resource and time limited and therefore find it more  \n \ndifficult to put time aside, so the views of practitioners from these organisations may  \n \nhave been lost. The participant organisations operate services in a large, diversely  \n \npopulated urban area, and the kind of experiences and views found here are likely to  \n \ndiffer from those from organisations operating in rural communities, with a widely  \n \ndispersed population. There are also likely to regional variations that are not reflected  \n \nin this study.  \n \n However as a pilot study, one of the objectives is to provide background to inform a  \n \nlarger scale study proposal which aims to involve the views of a larger number of  \n \nparticipants including service users and primary care practitioners.  \n \nConclusion   \n \n 23 \nThe VCS have a long history of working with marginalised, disadvantaged and \u2018hard  \n \nto reach\u2019 groups and as discussed their experiences may provide potential lessons for  \n \nstatutory service providers, particularly health services. \n \nThe VCS is able to provide added value in terms of the resources they offer; the  \n \nprocedures they employ and how they are organised [30].  \n \n \nFrom the interviews conducted there are four main areas of importance that have  \n \narisen that relate to how best to engage \u2018hard to reach groups\u2019: attitude of staff;  \n \nservice flexibility; working in partnership with other organisations and empowering  \n \nusers involvement. In order to fully engage with the \u2018hard to reach\u2019 and provide an  \n \nequitable health service for all, the NHS must embrace some of the philosophies that  \n \nappear to underpin the VCS. \n \n \nCompeting Interests \n \nNone \n \nAuthors Contribution \n \nSF conducted the interviews and drafted the original manuscript.
