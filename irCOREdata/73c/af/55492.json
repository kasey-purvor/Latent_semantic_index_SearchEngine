However, from the late 1970s economic and \ndemographic pressures and ideological challenges, particularly from the New Right, \nled to cuts in spending on welfare, increased private involvement and an emphasis on \nmore individualistic and selectivist approaches to provision. Recently some scholars \nhave begun to discuss the emergence of a \u201enew liberal consensus\u201f around welfare \nprovision. \n \nDrawing upon interviews with ten per cent of the House of Commons, this article \nexamines the extent to which a new political consensus upon welfare can be \nidentified. In addition to analysing responses to questions upon welfare issues it \nconsiders the extent to which MPs themselves believe there to be some degree of \nconsensus in approaches to welfare. It also considers whether any consensus exists \nmerely in the political language used in relation to welfare issues, or whether there is \na more substantive convergence. \n \n \n 2 \nMPs\u2019 attitudes to welfare: A new consensus? \n \nThe period from 1945 until the late 1970s has frequently been depicted as being \nmarked by a broad degree of political consensus in a range of policy areas. The broad \nparameters of this \u201econsensus\u201f are commonly conceived to encompass: commitment \nto a mixed economy, full employment, conciliation of the trade unions, state welfare \nprovision, and foreign policy (Kavanagh and Morris, 1994). In the field of welfare \nthis implied a general acceptance of broadly social democratic ideals including: a \ncommitment to the maintenance of large government agencies, most notably the NHS, \nto provide welfare services to meet a range of social needs free at the point of \ndemand; continued expansion of state welfare provision as the economy grew; and a \ncommitment to maintaining low levels of unemployment through Keynesian \neconomic policies (for example, Lowe, 2005; Thane, 1982; Pierson, 1991). From \n1945 to the late 1970s, while support for the welfare state was the subject of periodic \nintra-party debate, and the boundaries of state provision waxed and waned (mainly the \nformer), the principles of the \u201eclassic\u201f welfare state were upheld by governments of \neither political hue and enjoyed widespread public support (Lowe, 1999; Timmins, \n1995). Although the extent of welfare provision changed as new social problems \nemerged or priorities shifted, changes, as Peter Taylor-Gooby (1991: 23) observes, \nwere mainly at the margins, \u201ethe core of the state welfare provision went largely \nunchallenged, either from left or right\u201f.  \n \n This broad consensus was put under increasing strain in the 1970s as \nstagnating economic growth led to rising unemployment, and demographic pressures \ncreated by an ageing population led to new and expansive patterns of demand for \nwelfare provision. The Conservative government elected in 1979, influenced by New \nRight thinking, was committed to reducing the role of the state, promoting the private \nsector, and introducing free-market principles in the state sector. The Prime Minister, \nMargaret Thatcher, rejected the politics of consensus in favour of conviction, openly \ndismissing consensus as \u201ethe process of abandoning all beliefs, principles, values and \npolicies\u201f (Seldon, 1994: 502). The neo-liberal policies of the Thatcher government, \nled many observers to proclaim the end of the post-war consensus. In 1990, Dennis \nKavanagh, the most notable and consistent obituarist for consensus politics, described \nhow Thatcher had either wholly or in part dismantled all the main \u201eplanks\u201f of the \npost-war consensus. At the same time, he observed, the emergence of the New Right \nwas matched by a \u201enew left\u201f as the Labour party shifted to the left in response to \nThatcherite policies, and a \u201enew centre\u201f as the newly created SDP sought to occupy \nthe vacant centre ground (Kavanagh, 1990).  \n \nThe decline of consensus politics under Margaret Thatcher coupled with the \nopening of archival material related to post-war policymaking, led some to question \nwhether a post-war consensus had ever existed (Pimlott, 1988; Jones and Kandiah, \n1996). Nevertheless, consensus has remained an enduring and appealing concept \n(Addison, 1993; Hickson, 2004). Reviewing the consensus debate in 1994, following \nthe removal of Thatcher, and shortly after the election of Tony Blair to the Labour \nleadership, Anthony Seldon (1994: 512) identified a new degree of \u201epolicy \nconvergence\u201f between the Labour and Conservative front-benches, which he \nsuggested had brought them \u201ecloser on many issues than at any point since the 1970s\u201f. \nSignificantly, Seldon attributed much of this convergence to changes in party \nleadership. John Major, he observed, embraced a form of Conservatism much closer \n 3 \nto the One-Nation Conservatism of Butler, Macmillan and Heath than the neo-\nliberalism of Thatcher, while Kinnock, Smith and Blair had each sought to shift the \nLabour party towards a more centrist position. Seldon, however, remained sceptical \nabout the degree to which the broad areas of agreement between the leadership of the \ntwo main parties reflected the views of the bulk of the parliamentary parties. \nConsequently, while expressing confidence that consensus would continue to be a \ndominant feature of British politics in the twenty-first century, Seldon stopped short \nof proclaiming the emergence of a new consensus (Seldon, 1994). \n \nSeldon\u201fs caution was born at least in part out of uncertainty as to whether a \nfuture Labour government might continue on a centrist course or feel constrained to \nreturn to the radicalism of the early 1980s. It is perhaps not surprising then that since \nNew Labour\u201fs election in 1997, debate about the emergence of a new consensus has \nintensified. While the New Labour government elected in 1997 was committed to \nincreased welfare spending there was to be no return to a notional Golden Age of \nuniversal welfare provision. Although the pressures of mass unemployment have \ndeclined, the demands of pensions and healthcare for an ageing population continue to \nplace considerable strain on the welfare state. These continued demographic \npressures, coupled with pressures from the global economy to drive down taxes and \nregulation, have led to a fundamental shift in Labour party thinking regarding the \nprinciple of universal welfare provision. In office New Labour followed many of the \npolicies of the previous Conservative government, including spending restraint, the \nimportation of market principles into the state sector, and emphases on selectivity, \nindividual responsibility and the role of work incentives in relation to benefits \n(Taylor-Gooby, 2001).  \n \n The policies of the New Labour government, particularly in the field of \nwelfare, have led some to suggest that since 1997 policy convergence has transformed \ninto a new consensus between the main parties. Michael Williams (2000) a former \nWhitehall civil servant, proclaimed the emergence of a new consensus about the role \nof the state in the 1990s. Nowhere was the new consensus better captured, Williams \nargued, than in approaches to welfare, where consensus was driven by the need for \nnational competitiveness in a global economy. This was to be achieved in part by \nfundamental reform of the welfare state aimed at containing public spending; shifting \nthe balance towards services used by most of the electorate; controlling demands on \nwelfare by encouraging claimants to enter the labour market; and modernising public \nservices to raise productivity (Williams, 2000). Focusing in detail on welfare, Peter \nTaylor-Gooby (2001) has made a similarly convincing case for a new \u201eliberal\u201f \nconsensus on welfare. Like Williams, Taylor-Gooby explains welfare reform in the \nUK as a response to labour-market change, demography and globalisation, but also \nemphasises the electoral imperatives of Britain\u201fs two-party system in which parties \n\u201etend to diverge while seeking an electorally viable solutions to problems, but \nconverge on the \u201cmiddle ground\u201d when a solution that attracts support is found\u201f. That \nsolution, Taylor-Gooby suggests, involves widespread agreement on the retrenchment \nof spending, the promotion of privatisation in key areas, notably pensions, the \ntargeting of benefits through means testing and other restrictions, and the importance \nof labour market activation through incentives, training and what is effectively \nworkfare (Taylor-Gooby, 2001: 169). However, while Taylor-Gooby and others have \nidentified a broad degree of policy convergence, Lowe has highlighted continued \ntensions within the main parties over the movement towards consensus. In particular, \n 4 \nLowe highlights a sustained debate within the Conservative Party over the extent to \nwhich the welfare state should be dismantled, while also suggesting that the Labour \nparty has been split by a more fractious debate over the extent to which the role of the \nmarket should be enhanced in a range of welfare policy areas. Such tensions, Lowe \nsuggests, are not sufficient to invalidate the concept of consensus, but arise from the \nfact that the two parties have converged from very different ideological positions \n(Lowe, 2005: 433). These tensions are nevertheless significant and suggest that the \nmovement towards consensus is as much a source of debate within the main parties as \nbetween them.  \n \n This article examines the extent to which a new political consensus upon \nwelfare can be identified within the House of Commons, using data derived from a \nseries of face-to-face interviews with MPs, carried out between October 2004 and \nAugust 2005. The article seeks to analyse MPs\u201f responses to questions about the role \nof the state in welfare, and also considers the extent to which MPs themselves believe \nthere to be some degree of consensus in approaches to welfare. It examines whether \nthis consensus exists merely in the political language used in relation to welfare \nissues, or whether there is a more substantive convergence. It focuses on the level of \nintra-party debate on welfare provision, the future of the welfare state and the welfare \npolicies of the New Labour government since 1997.  \n \n This research builds upon work undertaken by Bochel and Taylor-Gooby \nwhich surveyed MPs\u201f attitudes to welfare in the late 1980s, at a similar stage in the \nlife of the Thatcher government (Taylor-Gooby and Bochel, 1988; Bochel, 1992). \nSuch detailed research on MPs\u201f attitudes and opinions is notoriously difficult to \nconduct. Any attempt to construct a representative sample of Parliamentary opinion, \nis largely dependent upon the willingness of MPs to agree to lengthy face to face \ninterviews (Lilleker, 2003). Nevertheless, this research is based upon a sample of \nParliamentary opinion which is broadly representative of the House of Commons as a \nwhole, according to a number of criteria. Sixty-eight MPs were interviewed, a sample \ncomprising ten per cent of the House of Commons balanced for party representation, \n(32 Labour; 21 Conservative; 10 Liberal Democrat; 2 SNP; 2 Plaid Cymru, 1 \nIndependent). Those interviewed reflected a broad range of Parliamentary experience, \nincluding MPs elected to Parliament between 1970 and 2005, and comprised current \nand former Ministers, select committee members and chairs, experienced \nbackbenchers, and MPs newly elected to Parliament in 2005. While the small \nnumbers involved make cohort analysis difficult, the sample is broadly in line with \nthe composition of the House of Commons, not only in party terms, but also, for \nexample, with 51 per cent of participants elected since the 1997 general election, \ncompared with 61 per cent of the Commons as a whole, and 24 per cent of the sample \nbeing women, compared with a figure of 20 per cent of the current House.  \n \n The survey took the form of semi-structured interviews, with open-ended \nquestions designed to allow MPs to respond in their own terms to broad questions \nrelating to the role of government in welfare, and more structured questions on \nspecific issues, for example paying for welfare, which allowed for closer \ncomparability of responses. In an effort to militate against MPs merely reciting the \nparty line, the interviews were conducted on a confidential basis, and MPs were \nencouraged to articulate their personal attitudes and beliefs. Whilst it is impossible to \ndetermine the degree to which individual MPs were speaking with absolute candour, \n 5 \nthe success of this approach may in part be revealed by the number of MPs from all \nparties who were prepared to express opinions at variance with party policy. \nHowever, it should also be recognised that MPs within the same party tend to share \nthe same beliefs and values, and more often than not will support the general party \nline, not because they feel they have to, but because it coincides with their personal \nbeliefs (Cowley, 2005).  \n \nWhat do we mean by consensus? \n \nAn examination of consensus politics in Britain not only involves consideration of the \ncontent of that consensus, but also raises questions about the nature of consensus \nitself. What is meant by consensus? To whom does it apply, and how does one \nidentify it?  \n \n The definition of consensus in many respects defines individual positions in \nthe consensus debate. Ben Pimlott, perhaps the most cogent critic of the idea of a \npost-war consensus, adopted a particularly broad and value-laden definition for which \nhe not surprisingly found few examples in British post-war politics. Consensus, \nPimlott argued, is a powerful and emotive term, which means more than mere \nagreement. \u201eConsensus,\u201f he asserted, \u201eis said to exist not when people merely agree, \nbut when they are happy agreeing, are not constrained to agree, and leave few of their \nnumber outside the broad parameters of their agreement\u201f (Pimlott, 1988: 130). \nMoreover, Pimlott suggested that consensus carries with it a value element. It is a \npositive thing, to be sought after and cherished: \u201epeople seek to \u201cembrace\u201d, \u201ccapture\u201d \nand \u201cinfluence\u201d the consensus and are proud to claim possession of it\u201f (1988: 130). \nAfter positing such a harmonious definition of political consensus it is hardly \nsurprising that he concluded that the idea of the British post-war consensus is little \nmore than a myth. \n \n In contrast, other observers of post-war politics have employed a more limited \ndefinition of consensus, which allows for broad areas of agreement within an \nadversarial political system. In influential work published in the 1960s, Samuel Beer \n(1965) was one of the first to identify a broad \u201epolicy convergence\u201f between the \nLabour and Conservative parties, whilst conceding the existence of marked \ndifferences between the main parties in the values which underpinned those policies \n(Seldon, 1994). This more limited definition of consensus as policy convergence or \nwhat David Marquand terms, \u201ethe philosophy of overlap\u201f, has been widely embraced \n(Marquand, 1988). The principal value of this interpretation is that it allows for a \nsubstantial measure of party political debate. Kavanagh and Morris, for example, take \nissue with Pimlott\u201fs use of consensus, \u201eas a synonym for cross-party agreement\u201f, \nasserting that it is better understood as agreement on a broad framework, within which \nparty disagreement would take place: \u201eA set of parameters which bounded a set of \npolicy options regarded\u2026 as administratively practicable, economically affordable \nand politically acceptable\u201f (Kavanagh and Morris, 1994: 13). These parameters, they \nargue, merely served to contain the debate, but within them, disagreements were as \nfiercely contested as ever. Similarly, with regard to welfare, Thane recognised the \nexistence of a broad consensus, but suggested that the post-war Labour government \n\u201eused its majority to push the consensus further towards its limits than might have \nbeen expected of a Conservative government\u201f (1982: 267). \n \n 6 \n This balancing of consensus and conflict is also integral to debate over the \nlocus or extent of political consensus in Britain. Pimlott\u201fs suggestion that any \nconsensus should be broadly inclusive has been widely contested by those who have \nsought to explain debate both within and between parties. Anthony Seldon suggests \nthree distinct groups for the location of political consensus: party supporters; \nWhitehall officials; and party elites when in office. Popular consensus among party \nsupporters, Seldon suggests is the most easily contested. There is, he argues little \nevidence for consensus between grassroots Labour and Conservative supporters; \nrather the further one moves from the party leadership the greater the degree of \nconflict between the parties. Seldon does however concede that for much of the post-\nwar period there was considerable popular support for state welfare provision, and \nRodney Lowe in particular has strongly argued that public demands for social security \nand full employment were widespread and identifiable features of post-war Britain \n(Seldon, 1994; 505; Lowe, 2005). There is greater support for the idea of consensus \namong Whitehall officials. Public choice theory and the burgeoning literature on the \ncivil service has long suggested that the continuity provided by the civil service is at \nthe heart of the post-war consensus. Detailed historical research by writers such as \nAddison (1975) has provided strong evidence for \u201ea Whitehall consensus\u201f, while \nMarxist critiques have suggested that consensus was manufactured by senior civil \nservants as a means of incorporating the Labour movement into the hegemonic values \nof the state (for example, Miliband, 1983). However, perhaps the most enduring \ninterpretation is the idea of consensus among party elites. This interpretation, stressed \nby Kavanagh and Morris, suggests that when in office party leaderships naturally \ngravitate towards the political centre ground and embrace consensual policies \ndesigned to retain parliamentary and electoral support. This view also allows for \nsubstantial differences between the anti-consensual statements of parties when out of \noffice and policies pursued when elected, and differences of opinion between party \nleaderships and their backbenchers (Kavanagh and Morris, 1994). \n \nMPs\u2019 attitudes to welfare: the role of the state in welfare \n \nIn order to determine the degree of political consensus on welfare, MPs were asked a \nseries of questions designed to reveal their general attitudes towards the role of the \nstate in welfare provision, what might loosely be called their philosophy of welfare, \nand more structured questions on specific aspects of welfare policy. Their replies \nwere compared with data from Taylor-Gooby and Bochel\u201fs survey of 1986-7 in an \neffort to determine whether any shift in parliamentary political opinion had occurred \nover the past two decades, and whether that shift represented a movement towards a \nnew consensus on welfare.  \n \nWhile Taylor-Gooby and Bochel were not able to compare their findings with \ncomparable research on MPs\u201f attitudes to welfare at the time of the perceived post-\nwar consensus in the 1950s and 1960s, their research supported the widely held view \nthat there had been a fundamental breakdown in the political consensus on approaches \nto welfare in the 1980s. On the broad philosophical question regarding the role of the \nstate in welfare, Taylor-Gooby and Bochel found an absence of consensus, and \nidentified a strong division on party lines (Table 1). Conservatives tended to favour a \nminimalist state that would concentrate its activities on meeting basic needs targeted \nat a small proportion of the population frequently described as the \u201edeserving\u201f poor. \nThe most popular description of the role of the state, used unprompted by three-\n 7 \nquarters of Conservative MPs interviewed by Taylor-Gooby and Bochel, was that of a \n\u201esafety-net\u201f. In contrast, Labour MPs were much more inclined to see the ideal role of \nthe state as providing universal services of a high standard, and a substantial minority \ntook the argument beyond universal provision and argued that the state should pursue \npolicies designed to provide equality through redistribution. The SDP\/Liberal group \ncomprised only a small part of Taylor-Gooby and Bochel\u201fs sample; they tended to \nfavour a high national minimum level of provision, but this was tempered by a \nconcern for the preservation of community and was not necessarily seen as being \nuniversal in nature (Bochel, 1992). \n \nTABLE 1. MPs\u2019 views on the role of the state in welfare, 1986-7, (Bochel, 1992) \n(percentage of responses by party). \n Labour Conservative Liberal\/SDP \nSafety-net\/to meet genuine need only 0 70 0 \nTo support the extension of private \nwelfare \n0 14 0 \nTo ensure a high national minimum \nin an agreed range of services \n56 9 75 \nTo meet need 12 0 0 \nTo redistribute\/advance equality 29 0 0 \nIt depends what the country can \nafford \n3 2 25 \nNumber 43 34 4 \n \nWhen asked the same question in the current survey, although MPs continue \nto be divided broadly on party lines, there has been a marked movement towards the \ncentre on the part of the three main parties (Table 2). In broad terms Conservative \nMPs continue to support a more minimalist perception of the role of the state, with \nconsiderable support for private provision. Similarly, Labour and Liberal Democrat \nMPs continue to favour a more collectivist approach to welfare. However, a large \nproportion of Labour MPs (47 per cent) now suggested a new role for the state in \nwelfare; these MPs supported the idea of a broad state safety-net, but augmented this \nwith the idea that once individuals were caught in the safety-net it was the state\u201fs \nresponsibility to propel them quickly back into work. They described the role of the \nstate as, \u201emore pro-active\u201f, \u201eas an enabler\u201f, or \u201ea mechanism to lift people out of \npoverty\u201f. While this view was based partly on a belief that for a host of reasons the \nwell-being of individuals is improved through employment, it was primarily a \nquestion of cost. As one Labour MP observed, \u201ethe notion of the passive recipient of \nbenefit is no longer valid, apart from anything else large numbers of people on benefit \nplace too much pressure on the economy\u201f. This idea of the welfare state as an \nenabling mechanism, which featured so prominently in the current survey, did not \nfeature at all in MPs\u201f responses to Taylor-Gooby and Bochel\u201fs survey. Support for \nthis more active and selective approach to welfare has, not surprisingly, grown at the \nexpense of support for a high level of universal provision, although support among \nLabour MPs for redistribution remains relatively high. A similar shift in attitudes may \nbe discerned among Liberal Democrat MPs. Although Taylor-Gooby and Bochel did \nnot speak to many Liberal\/SDP MPs in 1986-7, their results indicated strong support \nfor a high national minimum level of welfare provision. In the present survey Liberal \nDemocrat support for universal provision remains high, but a significant proportion of \nLiberal Democrat MPs have now embraced the idea of the welfare state as an \nenabling mechanism. \n 8 \n \nIt is not only those on the left who have changed their views, Conservative \nMPs have also moved towards the centre. A significantly smaller proportion of \nConservative MPs (33 per cent), now believe the government should  provide only a \nsafety net for those in the most need, compared with the position in the 1980s (70 per \ncent). There has also been a movement away from support for the extension of private \nprovision in favour of a role for the state in working with a number of other providers \nincluding charities as a means of addressing welfare challenges such as child and \npensioner poverty. Thus, while there is still strong support for a minimalist approach \nto state provision, a significant minority of Conservative MPs now support a more \nactive role for the state in improving people\u201fs lives. This group of MPs, which \nincludes former Ministers from both the Thatcher and Major governments and current \nConservative front-benchers, spoke about the role of government in building \ncommunities and improving life-chances, in some respects coming close to Labour \nMPs\u201f views of the state\u201fs enabling role. Several went out of their way to dissociate \nthemselves from Thatcherite philosophies, explicitly declaring that \u201ethere is such a \nthing as society\u201f and that \u201epeople are social animals, not atomised individuals\u201f. A \nnumber stressed the importance of combating poverty, particularly among children \nand pensioners, but were nevertheless keen to stress that the welfare state should not \nmerely hand-out money but should encourage people to help themselves. This \nemphasis on what more than one Conservative MP termed \u201etough love\u201f, in which \nwelfare provision is necessary but \u201ehanding out pounds is not enough\u201f, has brought \nthe views of Conservative and Labour MPs increasingly into alignment. \n \nTABLE 2.

In Taylor-Gooby and Bochel\u201fs survey there was a \nmarked division between Conservative MPs, who believed that the state should \nsupport the extension of the private sector in welfare provision, and Labour MPs who \noverwhelming supported a high level of state provision. Indeed, Bochel reported that \nno Labour MPs referred to supporting the private sector as part of the state\u201fs role \n(Bochel, 1992: 54). The current survey indicates a highly significant shift in Labour \nMPs\u201f attitudes towards the role of the private sector in welfare provision. When \n 9 \ndiscussing who should be responsible for provision (Table 3), half of Labour MPs \nbelieved that services should be provided mainly by the state, and half believed that \nthere should be a range of providers including the state, private and charitable sector. \nWhile Labour MPs continue to believe that the state should be the principal financer \nof welfare services there is much less concern about who delivers those services. As \none Labour MP stated, \u201ethe state will take less of a role in providing but maintain its \nrole as the funder and a guarantor of quality\u201f. This represents a marked shift in Labour \nMPs\u201f attitudes since the 1980s, and suggests a potentially substantial measure of \nsupport for the Labour leadership in seeking to expand the role of the private sector in \nwelfare provision.  \n \nTABLE 3. Who should be responsible for providing welfare services? \n(percentage of responses by party). \n Labour Conservative Liberal \nDemocrat \nSNP\/Plaid\/ \nIndependent \nTotal \n% \n%% \nMainly the state 50 0 56 80 37 \nA range of providers \nincluding state, private and \ncharitable sectors \n8 35 33 0 20 \nThe public and private \nsector in partnership \n42 30 11 20 32 \nMainly the private sector 0 35 0 0 12 \nNumber 26 20 9 5 60 \n \n \nThis shift contributes to a considerable degree of overlap between all the main \nparties in attitudes towards the provision of services. While there was no cross party \nsupport for welfare services being mainly provided by the state, a view which no \nConservatives supported, or for the view that provision should be mainly the \nresponsibility of the private sector, a view only supported by Conservative MPs, the \nidea that there should be a range of providers, including the state, private and \ncharitable sectors, received substantial support from all the main parties. This \ncommitment to diversity in the range of provision, with the emphasis on \u201ewhat matters \nis what works\u201f, rather than who provides services and benefits has been central to \nLabour policy on welfare since 1997, and arguably lies at the heart of any new \nconsensus on welfare. Although interestingly, a larger proportion of Labour than \nConservative MPs referred to the public and private sector working in partnership, \nwhile a much larger proportion of Conservative than Labour MPs referred to the \ncharitable sector as a provider of services.  \n \nMPs\u2019 attitudes to welfare: paying for welfare \n \nCommitment to diversity in the delivery of welfare is often presented, alongside \nwidespread agreement on retrenchment in spending, as part of a new consensus on \nwelfare (Taylor-Gooby, 2001). However, while there is some clear evidence of \nconsensus on delivery, any consensus on the financing of welfare, at least amongst \nbackbench MPs, is somewhat more ambiguous. While there is considerable overlap in \nattitudes towards who should provide services, there remain marked divisions \nbetween Conservative and Labour MPs regarding the role of the state in the financing \nof such services (Table 4). Whatever their views on the delivery of services, Labour \n 10 \nand Liberal Democrat MPs continue to believe that welfare services should be \nfinanced by the state through general taxation and national insurance. Conservative \nMPs believe that individuals should bear some of the burden of the cost, and a \nsignificant minority of Conservative MPs (25 per cent) felt that beyond a safety-net \nfor those in the most need, the welfare burden should be borne mainly by individuals \nand their families. Moreover, several Conservative MPs stressed that Labour\u201fs \nwelfare policies were too generous and suggested instead significant targeted cuts in \npublic spending. \n \nTABLE 4.

Only 29 \nper cent of MPs questioned favoured an increase in taxation to pay for increased \nservices, compared to 71 per cent who stated clearly that they would not be in favour \nof such an increase. However, the bulk of those opposed to tax funded increases in \nprovision were Conservative MPs, none of whom supported this; while Labour and \nLiberal Democrat MPs were fairly evenly divided, although in both cases the majority \nwere opposed to tax increases. Perhaps predictably, in explaining their attitudes \ntowards tax funded increases in provision, Labour MPs frequently pointed to the scars \nof eighteen years of opposition, and in particular the memory of the 1992 General \nElection. Interestingly, despite being the only party in recent years to have advocated \nincreasing taxes to pay for public services, Liberal Democrat MPs were only slightly \nmore supportive of this than Labour MPs. Several MPs from the Labour and Liberal \nDemocrat parties pointed to the effect on incomes of Gordon Brown\u201fs 2002 budget in \nwhich national insurance contributions were increased, the redistributive effects of \nwhich were widely publicised shortly before the 2005 General Election (Brewer et al., \n2005). While generally applauded by Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs, it was felt \nby many that this was enough, and that any further demands on the pay packets of the \npublic would be unpopular, and electorally damaging. \n \nTABLE 5.

There was widespread agreement among \nMPs from all parties, irrespective of their personal attitudes towards tax and spending, \nthat restraints on taxes and public spending are essential for electoral success. Indeed, \nwhen asked to outline the main challenges facing the welfare state today, cost set \nagainst the public desire for lower taxes was the second most popular choice among \nboth Labour and Conservative MPs, and was mentioned by more Liberal Democrat \nMPs than any other factor. Significantly, however, \u201etoo much state provision\u201f which \nwas the most popular choice among Conservative MPs was not mentioned as being a \nsignificant challenge by MPs from any of the other parties. \n \nMPs\u2019 attitudes towards consensus \n \nFinally, it is instructive to consider the extent to which MPs themselves believe there \nto be some degree of consensus in approaches to welfare. MPs\u201f responses to this \nquestion revealed a highly ambivalent attitude towards consensus (Table 6). Only 14 \nper cent of MPs were unequivocal in affirming the emergence of a political \nconsensus, while a further 41 per cent believed there was some degree of consensus. \nHowever, a large proportion (45 per cent), believed there to be no consensus at all. A \ncloser examination of MPs\u201f responses reveals an even greater degree of ambivalence. \nWhilst the majority (55 per cent) believed there to be at least some degree of \nconsensus, their responses were generally more varied and ambiguous than those who \nrejected the idea of consensus. MPs who disputed the emergence of a consensus were \nparticularly forthright, reverting to entrenched party positions and on occasion \nexpressing indignation at the suggestion. This was particularly the case with Labour \nand Conservative MPs. Liberal Democrat MPs as a whole were more sceptical about \nthe idea of consensus, with none positively asserting the existence of consensus, and a \ncommon response among Liberal Democrats was, \u201eif there is a consensus we are not \npart of it\u201f.  \n \nTABLE 6.

Several MPs pointed to similarities in the language used about welfare, but \ndoubted whether this represented a genuine shift in attitudes. There was a certain \ndegree of scepticism about Labour\u201fs commitment to welfare reform. Several \nConservative MPs referred to the government\u201fs reluctance to allow Frank Field to \n\u201ethink the unthinkable\u201f on welfare reform. The use of the language of reform was, \naccording to one Conservative MP, a smokescreen behind which Gordon Brown was \nexpanding the \u201ewelfare basket\u201f, or as one Liberal Democrat put it, \u201emadly \nredistributing\u201f. Indeed, several MPs from all parties expressed the belief that there \nwould be a return to more universal provision should Gordon Brown become Prime \nMinister. Similarly, Labour MPs expressed doubts that Conservative commitments to \ncombat poverty and unemployment would be sustained in office, and pointed to \nConservative plans to dismantle the New Deal as evidence of this. \n \n  It was also striking that few MPs readily viewed the pursuit of consensus as \nsomething to aspire to. Only five MPs, three Labour and two Conservatives, \nexpressed the belief that the parties should be actively seeking a new consensus on \nwelfare, and only one of these, a Conservative, expressed confidence that this could \nbe achieved, stating rather optimistically, \u201ewe\u201fre all completely at one with Frank \nField now\u201f, a view markedly not shared on the Labour benches. Many Labour MPs \nwere decidedly critical of the movement towards consensus, reluctantly conceding \nthat Labour\u201fs use of the private sector in welfare provision marked the emergence of a \nnew consensus but not one with which they were happy, or indeed wished to be part \nof. One Labour MP who was leaving Parliament at the 2005 General Election, was \nharshly critical of competition for the \u201esoggy centre\u201f which had stultified debate and \nundermined the welfare state. Indeed, few MPs from any party appeared to conceive \nof consensus as being arrived at by debate and compromise leading to movement on \nthe part of all the parties towards some centre ground. Where MPs did recognise some \nconsensus it was widely felt that this had been achieved by one party moving towards \nthe position of the other. This was particularly evident among those Labour MPs who \nopposed the private sector, and selective provision, and also among Conservative MPs \nwho were more inclined to believe that the balance of opinion was moving in their \ndirection.  \n \n Nevertheless, some MPs did believe there had been a positive movement on \nthe part of the main parties towards a new consensus on welfare and their responses \nsuggest that this movement had been broad based and not confined to the party \nleadership. MPs referred to \u201erealignment\u201f, \u201emovement towards an imaginary middle \nfrom both sides\u201f, \u201ea coming together of Tory and New Labour thinking\u201f, and \u201ea \nrealisation that we need to do things differently\u201f. However, where MPs did identify a \nconsensus it was largely related to objectives, and there remained fundamental \ndifferences of opinion over how to achieve these objectives. There was, for example, \nnotable consensus on the need to combat poverty particularly among children and \npensioners, but disagreements over the means of achieving this, particularly over \npensions means testing and the operation of tax credits. Similarly, reflecting \nsimilarities of position as outlined earlier, MPs identified a consensus on the \nimportance of propelling people into work, based upon the idea, as one Labour MP \nput it, \u201ethat work is normal, being on benefit is not\u201f. However, there remained areas of \ndisagreement over the extent to which Labour\u201fs policies would achieve this. Many \nConservative MPs, and a significant number of Liberal Democrat MPs, still felt the \nbenefits system was a serious disincentive to work. Even where there was consensus \n 13 \nover means, such as the increased use of mixed provision, there remained \nfundamental differences of opinion over how this provision should be managed. Thus, \nfor example, while Conservative MPs supported the government\u201fs attempts to involve \nthe charitable sector in welfare provision, they were critical of the fact that from their \nperspective, charities were not being allowed to drive need but were instead being co-\nopted to the government\u201fs agenda.  \n \nA new consensus? \n \nIn considering whether there has been any development of a new consensus on \nwelfare it is important to recognise that whatever the situation in the House of \nCommons it is not clear how far this would extend beyond the three main parties in \nParliament. Several MPs pointed to what they perceived as differences in attitudes \nbetween the Parliamentary and constituency parties, with the former generally being \nviewed by MPs as closer to the centre and the latter tending towards less consensual \napproaches to welfare provision. It is also interesting to observe that the shifts in \nattitudes within the three main parties are not reflected in the views of (the admittedly \nsmall number of) MPs from Plaid Cymru and the SNP, who generally supported a \nhigh level of universal state provision. This raises questions about the implications of \nsuch differences for the provision of welfare in Scotland and Wales, and these are \nclearly reinforced by the existence of the National Assembly for Wales and the \nScottish Parliament, both of which have already deviated from some of the social \npolicy positions adopted at Westminster in the relatively short periods of their \nexistence. In addition, it is not clear the extent to which the shifts in politicians\u201f \nattitudes to the welfare state are reflected in public opinion (Curtice and Fisher, 2003; \nTaylor-Gooby, 2004), a marked feature of the post-war consensus on welfare. \n \nNevertheless the situation within Parliament remains important for the \ndevelopment of social policy, as evidenced by the experiences of both Conservative \nand Labour governments since 1979, and there has clearly been some significant \nmovement towards a middle ground in MPs\u201f attitudes to welfare and this in turn lends \nsome support to the idea that there is an emerging consensus. This is particularly \nevident in any comparison of the attitudes of MPs today with those of the 1980s, a \nperiod when there was little or no consensus on approaches to welfare. However, if \nthere is some return to consensus on welfare it is a new consensus. The post-war \nconsensus involved considerable cross party agreement on means: a commitment to \nthe mixed economy; the maintenance of full employment through Keynesian \neconomic management; and a high level of state welfare provision. There were \nhowever, fundamental differences of opinion over objectives, with the Labour party \ncommitted to the redistribution of wealth and the Conservatives seeking a degree of \nintervention sufficient only to be compatible with market efficiency and personal \ninitiative (Lowe, 2005). The current survey reveals a significantly different situation \nwithin Parliament. Labour MPs, aware of the escalating costs of welfare provision, \nhave moved away from ideas centred on universal provision towards a more selective \ntargeted approach to welfare. At the same time some Conservative MPs, aware of the \ndamaging social costs of poverty, have shifted away from a strictly minimal approach \nto welfare towards a more collectivist position, whilst the appetite for tax cuts is \nsignificantly less than in the 1980s. There is therefore some convergence of attitudes \non a middle ground defined by financial restraint and the mixed provision of welfare \nservices, designed to help those in most need, while enabling others to help \n 14 \nthemselves. There is now arguably a broad consensus on ends, the elimination of \npoverty particularly among pensioners and children, the movement of people off \nwelfare and into work, and the creation of a competitive economy by restraining \nspending and the burden of taxation. There are some areas of consensus on the means \nof achieving this, most notably through a commitment to mixed provision. However, \nthere remain fundamental differences relating to the delivery of these objectives, with \nareas of disagreement over issues such as means testing, the minimum wage and tax \ncredits. \n \n Whilst this survey of MPs\u201f attitudes does therefore provide some evidence to \nsupport the work of Taylor-Gooby and others who have suggested the emergence of a \nnew consensus on welfare, it is not conclusive. There has clearly been some \nmovement of MPs towards a centre ground on welfare, but it is not clear how firm \nthis ground is. There is still strong support among backbench MPs for approaches to \nwelfare provision which reflect the poles of traditional Labour and Conservative \nvalues of social justice and minimal state support. A significant proportion of Labour \nMPs (22 per cent) continue to believe that the role of the state should be to \nredistribute wealth, while an even larger proportion of Conservative MPs (33 per \ncent), believe that the state should provide nothing more than a minimal safety-net for \nthose in the most need (Table 2). In the case of Labour MPs, support for redistribution \nhas changed little since the 1980s when 29 per cent of Labour MPs adopted this \nposition (Bochel, 1992). Indeed, many Labour MPs who took part in this survey \nexpressed grave misgivings about aspects of Labour\u201fs programme of welfare reform, \nmost notably the involvement of the private sector, and expressed strong opposition to \nthe movement towards a new consensus based on selective and mixed provision. This \nis reflected in marked divisions within the Labour party in relation to the financing \nand provision of welfare (Tables 3, 4 and 5). Significantly, these MPs were not \nprimarily well-known Labour rebels, but rather were MPs whose voting records are \nsolid and which compare favourably with that of the Prime Minister. Similarly, the \nresearch suggested the existence of a group of Conservative MPs interested in \ndeveloping considerable state support for individuals and communities in need. \nHowever, these Conservative MPs were themselves unable to estimate the depth of \nsupport for this position within even the Parliamentary party, although the leadership \nelection later in 2005 did help to highlight the existence of such views. In contrast, \nthere remained strong support among Conservative MPs for a limited approach to \nwelfare. There were powerful arguments about the disincentive nature of state \nprovision and, despite the Howard Flight debacle immediately prior to the 2005 \ngeneral election, several who called for increased charging or fundamental cuts in \nservices. It is likely therefore, that any \u201enew consensus\u201f in Parliament will remain \ncontestable not only between, but also within parties. \n \n \n 15 \nReferences \n \nAddison, P.
