Commemorated in more than 250 locations worldwide,\nthis day honors individuals who were killed due to anti-transgender hatred or prejudice. However, by\nfocusing on transphobia as the definitive cause of violence, this ritual potentially obscures the ways in\nwhich hierarchies of race, class, and sexuality constitute such acts. Taking the Transgender Day of Re-\nmembrance\/Remembering Our Dead project as a case study for considering the politics of memorial-\nization, as well as tracing the narrative history of the Fred F. C. Martinez murder case in Colorado, the\nauthor argues that deracialized accounts of violence produce seemingly innocent White witnesses who\ncan consume these spectacles of domination without confronting their own complicity in such acts.\nThe author suggests that remembrance practices require critical rethinking if we are to confront vio-\nlence in more effective ways.\nKey words: gender; identity; racism; transphobia; memorialization; narrative; activism; queer politics\nIn the last 9 years, Transgender Day of Remembrance\n(TDOR) has become a significant political event among\nthose resisting violence against gender-variant persons.\nCommemorated in more than 250 locations predominantly\nthroughout North America but also in Europe, Australia,\nNew Zealand, South America, and Southeast Asia, this day\nhonors individuals who were killed due to anti-transgender\nhatred or prejudice (Transgender Day of Remembrance\n[TDOR], 2005c, 2006b). Although various memorial activ-\nities are organized at a grassroots level, most of these events\nare linked through two sister websites: the Remembering\nOur Dead project (http:\/\/www.rememberingourdead.org\/\nabout\/core.html), which records transgender deaths, and the\nofficial TDOR site (http:\/\/www.gender.org\/remember\/\nday\/), which provides educational resources and publicizes\ntransgender vigils occurring around the world (TDOR,\n2005e, 2006d). Projects of the nonprofit organization\nGender Education & Advocacy, both websites provide\nvital tools for local community mobilization and play an\ninfluential role in shaping transgender remembrance\npractices worldwide (Gender Education & Advocacy,\n2003a).1 Indeed, these projects have played a crucial role in\nAddress correspondence concerning this article to Sarah Lamble, AHRC Research Centre for Law, Gender & Sexuality, Kent\nLaw School, Eliot College, University of Kent, Canterbury, Kent CT2 7NS, United Kingdom. E-mail: s.r.lamble@kent.ac.uk\n1 Although some websites include independent information\nabout Transgender Day of Remembrance (TDOR), most\nprovide a direct link to either the Remembering Our Dead\nproject or the TDOR website. See, for example, Crisalide\nAzione Trans Nazionale (2002a); Gay, Lesbian and Straight\nEducation Network (2007); Gay Straight Alliance Network\n(2006); Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation\n(2007); National Organization for Women (2004); Press for\nChange (2007); Support Transgenre Strasbourg (2005);\nVancouver Transgender Day of Remembrance (2006).\nBecause the TDOR website posts more than 25 educational\nresources, including sample flyers, press releases, banners,\nand instructions for organizing remembrance vigils in schools\nand communities at the local level, its influence is evident in\nmemorialization efforts elsewhere. Recent postings on\nYouTube (Victoria, 2006), for example, titled \u201cTransgender\nDay of Remembrance Tribute\u2014Part 1\u201d and \u201cTransgender Day\nof Remembrance\u2014Part 2,\u201d rely exclusively on the TDOR\nwebsite for their content and use the language verbatim. Also\nsee Crisalide Azione Trans Nazionale (2002b); Groupe\nActiviste Trans (2006); Houston Transgender Unity\nCommittee (2006); Trans Alliance Society (2003).\nSEXUALITY RESEARCH & SOCIAL POLICY\nraising public awareness about the extreme violence regu-\nlarly perpetrated against gender-variant persons. Despite\ntheir importance as resources for activism, the TDOR web-\nsite and the Remembering Our Dead project are nonethe-\nless limited in the scope of their analysis of the factors\ncausing violence against gender-variant individuals and of\nthe potential responses to such violence. By focusing on\ntransphobia as the definitive cause of violence, the websites\ndo not fully contextualize incidents of violence within their\nspecific time and place, thus obscuring the ways in which\nhierarchies of race, class, and sexuality situate and consti-\ntute such acts. In the process, transgender bodies are uni-\nversalized along a singular identity plane of victimhood\nand rendered visible primarily through the violence that is\nacted upon them.\nTaking the TDOR\/Remembering Our Dead project as\na case study for considering the politics of memorializa-\ntion, as well as tracing the narrative history of the Fred\nF. C. Martinez murder case in Colorado, I aim to demon-\nstrate how deracialized accounts of violence produce seem-\ningly innocent White witnesses who can consume these\nspectacles of domination without confronting their own\ncomplicity in such acts. Without addressing violence as a\nsystemic effect of power, I argue that current manifesta-\ntions of TDOR potentially limit the possibilities for\nresisting racialized gender violence in meaningful and\neffective ways.\nThis article is not written to denigrate the important\nwork of activists who struggle against violence,2 nor is it\nto suggest that we should abandon remembrance\npractices that honor those who have suffered from\nviolence. Such practices serve multiple purposes and\nmark important forms of collective healing, community\ngathering, and public denunciations of violence. Rather,\nthis article critically questions the politics of who and how\nwe remember, interrogates the implications of speaking\non behalf of the dead, and examines what is at stake in taking\nup particular kinds of remembrance practices. I argue that\nif we3 are to engage in effective struggle against violence,\nwe must resist remembrance practices that rely on reduc-\ntionist identity politics; we must pay attention to the spe-\ncific relations of power that give rise to acts of violence;\nand we must confront violence in its structural, systemic,\nand everyday forms.\nNarratives of remembrance are not merely problems\nof representation. The stories we take up in remembrance\nare constituent practices: They tell us who we are and\nhow we know the world. As Roger Simon (2005) noted,\n\u201cPractices of remembrance are questions of and for his-\ntory as a force of inhabitation, as the way we live with\nimages and stories that intertwine with our sense of lim-\nits and possibilities, hopes and fears, identities and dis-\ntinctions\u201d (p. 3). In other words, narratives as practices of\nremembrance have material effects on the social ordering\nof relations of power and the ways in which we come to\nknow ourselves in relation to the dead. These effects are\nneither politically neutral nor socially inconsequential:\n\u201cIn these practices of remembrance, there is a prospective\norientation that seeks to legitimate and secure particular\nsocial relations, making normative claims on the conduct\nof human behaviour\u201d (Simon, p. 4). Underlying this arti-\ncle is more than a debate about what version of a story is\ntold, how particular persons are presented, or who is\nincluded and excluded\u2014I wish to address a broader con-\ncern about what kinds of spaces for resistance narratives\nof remembrance help create and how those narratives\ndetermine the boundaries and possibilities for enacting\nchange.\nDecontextualized Violence: Deracing\nTransgender Bodies\nThe Remembering Our Dead project was founded by\ntrans activist Gwendolyn Ann Smith in response to the\ndeath of Rita Hester, an African American transwoman\nwho was murdered in her Massachusetts apartment in\nNovember 1998. Concerned that deaths of transgender\npersons were poorly documented and quickly forgotten,\nSmith began gathering and publicizing information about\ntransgender deaths so that trans communities would\nbetter know their own histories (Smith, 2000, 2001,2 This article arose from my own involvement in\nTransgender Day of Remembrance and my participation as\na nontrans person in ongoing struggles against trans-\nrelated oppression. I wrote this piece cautiously; I do not\nwish to replicate the history of nontrans persons who have\ncritiqued, demonized, and pathologized trans struggles. At\nthe same time, I take seriously the call for self-reflexivity\nwithin activism and my analysis emerges from concerns\nraised within my local trans and genderqueer communities\nabout the overall effectiveness and broader implications of\ncurrent manifestations of Transgender Day of\nRemembrance.\n3 I recognize that some readers may feel excluded from, or\nwish to remain outside, the various significations of the word\nwe as I use it in this article. Although my use of we does pre-\nsume readers\u2019 general interest in working to end oppressive\nviolence, I do not intend the term to denote inclusion or\nexclusion of any specific community. Rather, I invite readers\nto participate in the process of self-reflexive questioning of\nremembrance practices.\nMarch 2008 Vol. 5, No. 1 25\nSEXUALITY RESEARCH & SOCIAL POLICY\nMarch 2008 Vol. 5, No. 1 26\n2003). In November 1999, Smith organized the first\nTDOR, a candlelight vigil in San Francisco. Now an annual\nevent, TDOR has become \u201cthe largest multi-venue trans-\ngender event in the world\u201d (Smith, 2003, \u00b6 3; TDOR,\n2006a).\nAs part of the ongoing Remembering Our Dead pro-\nject, a small group of volunteers compile and record the\nname, date, location, and cause of death for trans-related\nmurders worldwide. As of November 2007, the list\nincluded 378 individuals (TDOR, 2007).4 The compre-\nhensiveness of the list is no doubt limited by an unavoid-\nable reliance on mainstream media sources, which\nconsistently fail to provide thorough reporting on trans-\ngender deaths, as well as reports from law enforcement\nofficers, which often reflect inadequate responses to\nviolence against transgender persons (Moran & Sharpe,\n2004). Indeed, as Smith (2000) noted, \u201cThe media\u2019s reluc-\ntance to cover our deaths lies near the heart of this project\u201d\n(\u00b6 3). Chronic underfunding and limited resources within\ntransgender communities poses further challenges to the\nproject, and the emotional burden of collecting this infor-\nmation can be high (Smith, 2001). Nevertheless, the pro-\nject is a collaborative one, with international appeals for\nreports and strong links with a range of gender-related\nsocial justice organizations (Remembering Our Dead,\n2006a, 2006b, 2006d). Likewise, many of the resources\nposted on the TDOR website are produced by other allied\ngroups in the United States, such as the Gay, Lesbian and\nStraight Education Network, the Gay-Straight Alliance\nNetwork, and the Transgender Law Center (TDOR, 2005d,\n2006c).\nThe TDOR website acknowledges that \u201cnot every\nperson represented during the Day of Remembrance self-\nidentified as transgendered\u2014that is, as a transsexual,\ncrossdresser, or otherwise gender-variant\u2014[but] each\nwas a victim of violence based on bias against transgen-\ndered people\u201d (TDOR, 2004b, \u00b6 2; 2005c, \u00b6 2). Both the\nTDOR website and the Remembering Our Dead project are\nthereby explicit in privileging transphobia as the exclusive\nmotivation for violence: \u201cOver the last decade, more than\none person per month has died due to transgender-based\nhate or prejudice, regardless of any other factors in their\nlives [italics added]\u201d (Smith, 2000, \u00b6 5; TDOR, 2005c, \n\u00b6 3, 2006b, \u00b6 3). Evident here is a deliberate effort to\nisolate transphobia from any other form of prejudice or\ncause of violence. From this vantage point, other factors\nare deemed not only to complicate our understanding of\nviolence, but also to pose a threat to the legitimacy of the\nproject\u2019s political goals. The authenticity of the cause is\nsecured through the authority of a particular community:\nThe murder list includes \u201conly those deaths that are known\nto the transgender community or that have been reported\nin the media\u201d (TDOR, 2004b, \u00b6 1). But who makes up this\ncommunity that determines who will be remembered?\nWho is the subject we are asked to remember?\nThe answers to these questions are not simple. First,\nthere is no clear consensus on what constitutes transgen-\nder, let alone transgender community. Emerging in the\nearly 1990s as an umbrella term to include a multiplicity\nof gender experiences and practices that transgress\ndominant norms of gender expression (including trans-\nidentified persons who use medical interventions to\nexpress their gender and those who do not, cross-dressers,\npan-gendered people, intersex persons,5 two-spirited\nindividuals, etc.), the term transgender has been broadly\nused as an identity around which gender-variant individ-\nuals could gather and organize political strategies.6 The\nterm also emerged in resistance to pathologizing labels\nimposed by the medical establishment and in contestation\nof the trivialization of gender-variant behavior in popular\nculture. However, fierce debates persist on how the term\nshould be used, whom it includes\u2014and what proximity it\nhas to queer, gay, lesbian, and bisexual organizing (Califia,\n1997; Currah, 2006; Feinberg, 1996; Moran & Sharpe,\n2004; Namaste, 2005; Phelan, 2001; Valerio, 2002).\nThese debates go beyond simple semantics and strike at\nthe root of political struggles revolving around citizenship\nrights and protection from harm. For individuals whose\nmembership in a particular group can greatly affect their\n4 Several lists of transgender murders are available online.\nHowever, the most comprehensive and widely cited list is\nmaintained on the Remembering Our Dead (2006c) and\nTransgender Day of Remembrance (2007) websites.\n5 Although intersex persons are often included within the\nscope of transgender struggles, a consensus is emerging\namong gender activists that intersex issues and transgender\nissues, though related, should not be conflated (Currah,\nJuang, & Minter, 2006; Intersex Society of North America,\n2006).\n6 Leslie Feinberg (1996) attributed the first use of \ntransgender to Virginia Prince, who coined the term in the\nlate 1980s as both a self-description and a way of describing\npeople who \u201ctrans the gender barrier [but] not the sex \nbarrier\u201d (Feinberg, p. x). Prince was attempting to find a\nname for people who live in a gender that is not traditionally\nassociated with their assigned gender at birth, yet differ\nfrom transsexuals by not seeking anatomical changes through\nsurgery or hormones. The term transgender sometimes\nstill is used to differentiate between those who seek medical\ninterventions and those who do not, but now is understood\nmore widely as an umbrella term. \nSEXUALITY RESEARCH & SOCIAL POLICY\nclaims to medical care, protection from violence, and legal\nrecognition of identity, the stakes are high.7\nThese divisions over who is included in the commu-\nnity resurface within projects such as TDOR, where\nbelonging through victimhood is the platform for politi-\ncal agency. For example, the 1993 high profile murder of\nBrandon Teena8 sparked fierce sectarian battles among\ntransgender, transsexual, and lesbian and gay activists,\nwho each wanted to claim this murder as an attack\nagainst their own kind (Halberstam, 2005; Hale, 1998).\nA similar example can be found in the 1996 murder of\nthree sex workers in Toronto who were shot within\nhours of each other by Marcello Palma. Two of the vic-\ntims, Deanna\/Thomas Wilkinson and Shawn Keagan,\nwere identified as cross-dressers and are listed on the\nRemembering Our Dead website as victims of transpho-\nbic violence. Yet they are also included in Douglas Janoff\u2019s\n(2005) recent inventory of homophobic violence in\nCanada. From a third camp, Mirha-Soliel Ross and Viviane\nNamaste (2005) maintained that these deaths arose from\nantiprostitute and class-based discrimination, an\nargument based on the fact that the perpetrator described\nstreet people and prostitutes as scum and demonstrated\nno clear evidence of transphobia.9 Similarly, Ross and\nNamaste noted that Grace Baxter, a fully passable, post-\noperative transsexual sex worker who is also listed on the\nTransgender Remembrance website, was killed by a john\nwho was unaware of her trans status. Ross thus denounced\nTDOR as \u201ca big, bold and sickening political fraud\u201d (quoted\nin Namaste, p. 92).\nWithin this political framework of claiming victims,\nactivists\u2014whose struggles are ultimately linked\u2014can\nbecome ensnared in what Razack and Fellows (1998)\ndescribed as competing marginalities. In this model, justice\nclaims rest on proof that one group is not only most\noppressed but also most innocent; that is, the group in\nquestion must convey itself as bearing no responsibility in\nthe oppression of others (Razack & Fellows). Identities\nare thus marked as constituting so-called good and bad vic-\ntims, and these categories tend to fall along particular\nclass, gender, and racial lines. The supposedly perfect\nvictim is the one who is believed to be most pure, innocent,\nand helpless\u2014typically the White, middle-class girl child.\nIt is not surprising, then, that Matthew Shepard and\nBrandon Teena, both marked as young, White, barely mas-\nculine (and, in Shepard\u2019s case, also middle-class), have\nbecome the poster children for protesting homophobic\nand transphobic violence.10 In contrast, cases involving\nvictims of color, prostitutes, and street people are rarely\nnoticed, particularly by mainstream media, politicians,\nand service organizations (Ott & Aoki, 2002). When less\nideal victims are taken up by the media or championed by\npolitical groups, undesirable facts or complex dimensions\nof identity are often omitted from the story so as to produce\na good-victim narrative. By predicating political strategies\non innocent victimhood, violence against individuals who\ndeviate from the ideal becomes less visible and more tol-\nerable. Consequently, \u201cthose who are the most severely\naffected victims of sexism and racism (e.g. prostitutes or\nteenaged black males in the juvenile justice system) qual-\nify least as \u2018genuine\u2019 victims of crime\u201d (Simon, 2000,\np. 1132). Hence, the claims of the most privileged groups\nare advanced through the disavowal of other groups\u2019 claims.\nActivists, no doubt, have strategic reasons why they\ncontinue to employ this tactic. As Razack and Fellows\n(1998) noted, \u201cOne reason we feel compelled to secure our\n7 For example, when legal definitions of transgender identity\nrequire surgery or hormones as proof of transition, individu-\nals who are unable or choose not to pursue such medical\ninterventions may be denied gender-appropriate identifica-\ntion on key documents, such as passports, drivers licenses,\nbirth certificates, and health cards. Individuals whose identifi-\ncation papers conflict with their self-expressed gender presen-\ntation may be denied vital social services and can be at higher\nrisk for state-based harassment and violence. Similarly, if a\nstate has human rights protections based on sexual orienta-\ntion but not on gender identity, or vice versa, the decision to\nclaim one particular identity over another can affect whether a\nperson is eligible for legal remedy against discrimination.\n8 I use the name Brandon Teena here because it is the most\ncommonly recognized name. However, as Jacob Hale\n(1998) carefully documented, the identity of the individual\nwho is popularly known as Brandon Teena was far more\ncomplicated than most accounts convey. It is not clear\nwhether this individual used the name Brandon Teena or\nfirmly identified within any single identity category.\n9 I would argue that this case is more complicated than what\nwas presented by any of the previously noted accounts; the\nevidence suggested that class, race, gender, and sexuality\nwere all factors in the murder. Although one might assume\nthat the issue of race is only in operation when the victim or\nperpetrator is non-White, such a view fails to understand\nthe logic of racial oppression. As many critical race scholars\n(see, for example, Delgado & Stefancic, 1997; Dyer, 1997;\nFrankenberg, 1993; hooks, 1992; Leonardo, 2004) have\ndemonstrated, Whiteness is not simply the absence of race,\nbut the site of a racial identity that renders itself invisible\nthrough its status as the norm.\n10 The racial identities of both individuals are nonetheless\ncomplex. Qwo-Li Driskill (2004) noted, for example, that\nBrandon Teena was of mixed White and Sioux Indian\nancestry. Although the significance and meaning of this\nheritage warrant further discussion, Driskill rightly pointed\nout that  the Native American dimension of Brandon\nTeena\u2019s identity is rarely acknowledged in queer and trans-\ngender accounts.\nMarch 2008 Vol. 5, No. 1 27\nSEXUALITY RESEARCH & SOCIAL POLICY\nMarch 2008 Vol. 5, No. 1 28\ngruesome details of violence, which are repeated at vigils\nand reiterated through the remembrance archive, have\nstrong visceral impact; we do not remember the names of\nthe victims so much as we remember the violence that was\ndone to them. Just as Western feminism\u2019s historical\nreliance on a universal female victim has tended to define\ngender as what is done to women, the gender identity of\ntrans people is signified by what is done to their bodies\n(Razack, 2001). Deliberately unmarked by race, class,\nage, ability, sexuality, and history, these individuals\u2014\notherwise unknown\u2014are rendered visible solely through\nthe violence that is enacted upon them. The very existence\nof transgender people is verified by their death. Violence\nthus marks the body as belonging to the trans community.\nIn this way, violence simultaneously obliterates and\nproduces a particular trans subject\u2014both materially (in\nthe act of killing) and symbolically (in the subsequent\nnarration).\nDefined by the details of brutality, violence is reduced\nto the snapshot of a crime scene, a momentary fragment\nin time between perpetrator and victim. Without history\nor context, the systemic roots of violence are rendered\ninvisible; violence is comprehensible only at the microlevel\nwhereby individual transphobia becomes the only viable\nexplanation. Besides being incomplete, this picture\nundermines the scope of antiviolence efforts. Several\nscholars have illustrated the problem of using phobias as\na primary explanation for violence (Spade & Willse, 2000).\nAs Gary Kinsman (1996) noted of homophobia, \u201cIt\nindividualizes and privatizes gay and lesbian oppression\nand obscures the social relations that organize it\u201d \n(p. 33). Hence, the trans murder victim emerges as the\nproduct of an individual hatred or fear rather than the\nresult of the accumulative effect of social institutions (such\nas legal, economic, and political systems) that are founded\non, and perpetuate, complex hierarchies of power and\nviolence (such as White supremacy, patriarchy, and\nheteronormativity).\nBy accumulating a collective list of murder victims,\nthe TDOR website does make efforts to demonstrate that\nacts of violence against transgender people are not iso-\nlated events. One of the educational handouts, titled\n\u201cAnti-Trans Murder: Over One A Month\u201d (TDOR, 2002),\nconveys the frequency with which such violence occurs. Yet\nthe prevalence of murders is provided as further evidence\nof widespread transphobia, an idea that invariably returns\nto individual perpetrators as the root cause of violence.\nThis analysis is confirmed by the handout\u2019s conflation of\njustice with individual punishment and retribution: \u201cThose\nwho are caught seldom receive sentences commensurate\nwith their crimes. In over 200 cases, only one such\nown place on the margin as the most oppressed is that not\nto do so is to risk erasure\u201d (p. 339). This concern is a vital\none for trans people, whose invisibility\u2014induced by dom-\ninant power relations of sex and gender norms\u2014makes it\ndifficult for them to secure such basic rights and services\nas heath care and housing. Historically treated as freaks\nof science, sources of entertainment, or fodder for\nacademic theorizing, trans people struggle to define\nvisibility on their own terms (Namaste, 2000). Even\namong groups who claim solidarity with transgender\npeople, tokenism and exclusionary practices persist\n(Namaste, 2005; Phelan, 2001). Within this context, there\nis \u201cmuch pressure to conform to the totalizing and essen-\ntializing dimensions of identity if claims of access to\nresources and demands for recognition of citizenship of\ntransgender people are to have the gloss of legitimacy\u201d\n(Moran & Sharpe, 2004, p. 412). Moreover, when the\nurgency of addressing violence is coupled with limited\nresources, time pressures, and media demands for sound-\nbite politics, the simpler, more rhetorical strategies can\neasily win out over complex and nuanced analysis.\nNot surprising, then, is that the political narrative of\nTDOR has been reduced to a singular cause (transphobia)\nand a singular identity (victim of transphobic violence).\nThe website achieves this narrative not only with its self-\ndescription but also through the remembrance archive\nitself. The list of victims in the archive includes no\ninformation on the age, race, class, ability, or particular\ncircumstances of each individual who was murdered\u2014\nnor is any such information provided about the people who\ncommitted each crime, even when the perpetrators are\nknown. Although a handful of victim profiles include a\nphoto of the person, most include only a generic silhou-\nette image (TDOR, 2005f; 2006e).11 Each case is\nabstracted from its history and context: Each murder is\ndecontextualized and reabsorbed within a unified narra-\ntive and a universalized body of the dead trans subject. The\nnarrative encoding of gender violence dovetails with a\nnarrative decoding of racial violence, class violence, and\nsexual violence. Within this framing, each individual death\ncan stand in and be substituted for another; difference is\nsubsumed within sameness.\nBecause the archive provides so few details about each\ncase, the cause of death becomes the most powerful marker\nof inclusion within the community of remembrance. The\n11 My drawing attention to the prevalence of silhouette\nimages is not meant as a critique of the project organizers,\nwho, as I noted previously, do not have the resources to\nfind photographs of every victim listed on the site. Rather,\nmy emphasis here is on the narrative effects of such images.\nSEXUALITY RESEARCH & SOCIAL POLICY\nmurderer is currently on death row, and just two others\nare serving life sentences\u201d (TDOR, \u00b6 4). The wording\nsuggests that justice would be better fulfilled if more\nperpetrators were given life\u2014or death\u2014sentences. Indeed,\nthe Remembering Our Dead project actively supports\nharsher penalties for transgender-related hate crimes\n(Gender Education & Advocacy, 2003b).\nSuch so-called solutions, however, fail to confront\nsystemic causes of violence (such as the criminal justice\nsystem itself) and ignore state complicity in authorizing\nviolence (Spade & Willse, 2000). As Wendy Brown (1995)\naptly demonstrated, the call for such judicial responses\n\u201ccasts the law in particular and the state more generally\nas neutral arbiters of injury rather than as themselves\ninvested with the power to injure\u201d (p. 27). Moreover,\nbecause hate crime claims require the entrenchment of a\nfixed identity in order to prove a victim\u2019s disadvantaged\nstatus, identities are reduced to stereotypical categories\nthat appear natural and immutable rather than as the\neffects of power relations (Brown). In other words, as\nJonathan Simon (2000) put it, \u201cThe satisfaction that\ncomes from avenging oppression caries the price of\nreinforcing the very categories of the original victimiza-\ntion\u201d (p. 11). Consequently, the TDOR website\u2019s efforts to\nillustrate the rifeness of violence are undermined by its\nsingular focus on transphobia.\nThe overarching political narrative of transphobia,\nhowever, is not absolute; it is destabilized by the highly\nracialized visual imagery conveyed through photos on the\nwebsite. Educational handouts and other resources\ninclude photos of selected murder victims, a majority of\nwhich depict non-White faces. Of the names listed, many\nare non-Anglo, and several are accompanied by a paren-\nthetical pronunciation key (e.g., \u201cJulio Argueta [HOO-\nlee-o ar-GET-tah]\u201d [TDOR, 2005a, p. 3]), which speaks to\na White Anglo audience presumed to be unfamiliar with\nsuch names. Marked as racialized others, these names\nand faces both reinforce the website\u2019s narrative norm of\nWhiteness and contest its totality. Against the political\nnarrative that denies racialized violence, these photo-\ngraphic images suggest that race cannot be ignored.12\nHence, two overlapping discourses are at work: the\nnarrative voice of the activist cause, which refuses to\nformally acknowledge race, and the visual messages\u2014\ncaptured by the names and the photos of racialized\nothers\u2014which explicitly call on race as a marker of\nvictimhood. Yet these discourses do not operate with equal\ncognitive effect. The activist narrative (which, arguably,\nsaturates the entire site) is overtly teleological, relying on\na coherent story line of cause (transphobia) and effect\n(violence), with death marking the moment of truth at the\nend of the story. By contrast, the racialized images, which\nare scattered randomly throughout the site, operate at a\nmore subconscious, yet nonetheless vivid level; they hover\nas a ghostly reminder of the dead, a lingering specter of\nrace. Because these images are few in number, their visual\nforce is particularly striking against the text-heavy website,\nfurther highlighting the significance of race even as race\nis formally written out of the official activist narrative.\nThese seemingly conflicting messages work symbiotically\nto produce both a naturalized White subject and a bru-\ntalized body of color. The website\u2019s photos depicting\nactivists\u2014seen at vigil ceremonies, marches, and speech-\nmaking events\u2014predominantly comprise White faces,\nwhereas the victim profiles depict predominantly people\nof color (TDOR, 2005b, 2005c, 2006b, 2007). When these\nimages are juxtaposed, White activists are positioned as\nsaviors of victims of color. In this way, the brutalized body\nof color is called upon to advance a political agenda that\nreinforces racial hierarchies at the same time as it disavows\nthe significance of race (Razack, 2001).\nAlthough the deracialized narratives of the TDOR\/\nRemembering Our Dead project emerge from a particu-\nlar political strategy, they are also the product of a broader\nsocial context that promotes individually focused and\nlegally oriented responses to violence. In particular,\nbecause corporate media are the primary source of report-\ning on violence and law enforcement is the primary mech-\nanism for redressing violence, these institutions play a\nsignificant role in setting the stage for activism. For\nexample, although antidiscrimination and hate crime law\nin the United States and Canada have been strongly\ncritiqued for their repeated failure to address multiple,\nintersectional, and structural forms of oppression (see\n12 A few online lists of transgender deaths explicitly note the\nracial identity of victims, highlighting the significance of\nrace. For example, of the 51 individuals included on\nGenderPAC\u2019s (2007) list of murder victims, 37 are identified\nas persons of color, the vast majority of which are African\nAmerican and Latina transwomen. In its 2006 report on\nkillings of transgender youth between the ages of 13 and \n30, GenderPAC explicitly noted that 91% of the victims were\npeople of color and the majority were economically poor.\nHowever, by claiming that \u201cif federal law mandated the FBI\nto track gender-based hate crimes, they would outweigh\nevery other category except race\u201d (and providing a graphic\nthat compared hate crime murders based on race, gender\nidentity, sexual orientation, ethnicity, religion, and disability),\nthe report nevertheless divided race from other dimensions\nof identity and risked succumbing to the politics of competing\nmarginalities (GenderPAC, 2006, p. 2).\nMarch 2008 Vol. 5, No. 1 29\nSEXUALITY RESEARCH & SOCIAL POLICY\nMarch 2008 Vol. 5, No. 1 30\nCrenshaw, 1989; Ehrenreich, 2002; Grabham, 2006;\nSpade & Willse, 2000), legal responses are still treated as\na key remedy for violence. Because raising public\nconsciousness is a key activist strategy, the naming power\nof hate crime legislation (i.e., identifying violence as per-\npetrated against specifically oppressed groups) remains\npolitically appealing (Spade & Willse). In seeking such\nrecognition, however, activists must adhere to the state\u2019s\nlimited criteria and logic for identifying and prosecuting\nhate crimes. Similarly, because corporate media are often\nthe first source of reporting about violence, such sensa-\ntionalized accounts can set the tone for subsequent\nnarratives. The Fred (F. C.) Martinez murder case, for\nexample, shows how law enforcement agencies and\nmainstream media shape the terms by which activists\nrespond to and recount incidents of violence. Tracing\nthese narratives, one can begin to see the depth to which\nderacialized accounts of violence are socially embedded\nand collectively authorized.\nThe Erasure of Race in the Fred (F. C.) \nMartinez Murder\nOn June 21, 2001, the brutalized and decomposing\nbody of 16-year-old Fred (F. C.) Martinez was found in a\nshallow canyon on the outskirts of Cortez, Colorado.\nMartinez, a Navajo high school student who identified as\nopenly gay and transgender, suffered blunt-force trauma\nto the head, as well as cuts to his abdomen and wrists. It\nwas reported that on the night of June 16, 2001, Martinez\nhad been chased by his attacker to a desolate, rocky area\nknown as the Pits, run into a barbed wire fence, struck in\nthe head with a rock, and left to die (Quittner, 2001).\nShaun Murphy, a White 19-year-old from Farmington,\nNew Mexico, subsequently pleaded guilty to second-\ndegree murder, after witnesses reported him bragging\nthat he had \u201cbug smashed a joto [Spanish derogatory\nslang for a gay or effeminate male]\u201d (Emmett, 2001i, \u00b6 11).\nAt the onset of investigation, Montezuma County\nSheriff Joey Chavez stated that detectives were \u201clooking\nat the boy\u2019s sexuality, as well as the fact that he was Native\nAmerican, as possible motives in the crime\u201d (Emmett,\n2001b, \u00b6 13). But race quickly disappeared as a relevant\nfactor. District attorney Joe Olt refused to prosecute the\nmurder as a hate crime, treating the case as though the\nseverity of the physical violence was all that mattered. As\nOlt explained to the local press: \u201cWe\u2019re looking at it as a\nmurder that is heinous enough.\u2026To me, a murder is a hate\ncrime\u201d (GenderPAC, 2001a, \u00b6 3).\nThe failure to treat the crime as legally hate motivated\nwas widely attributed to the fact that Colorado\u2019s crime-bias\nlegislation (Ethnic Intimidation Act of 1988) did not\ninclude sexual orientation or gender identity as grounds\nfor special prosecution (Colorado State General Assembly,\n2005). The fact that the legislation included race, color,\nand ancestry was considered\u2014by both news reporters\nand victim-advocacy groups\u2014irrelevant (Emmett, 2001e;\nGenderPAC, 2001a). Some news reports even implied\nthat Colorado had no hate crime legislation at all (Colorado\nAnti-Violence Program, 2001b; GenderPAC, 2002;\nHeidelberg, 2002).13 The outrage over the Martinez mur-\nder was subsequently channeled into lobbying efforts to\nreform Colorado\u2019s bias-crime statutes to include sexual\norientation\u2014changes that were successfully adopted in\n2005 (Colorado State General Assembly, 2005; Lambda\nLegal, 2001).14 When the Martinez case received brief\nnational attention, it was attributed to the antigay and anti-\ntransgender dimensions of the crime, and not at all to fac-\ntors of race (Colorado Anti-Violence Program, 2001a;\nMimiaga, 2002). When the story hit national news feed-\ners via the Associated Press, Martinez\u2019s Navajo identity\nwas not even acknowledged (Gay and Lesbian Alliance\nAgainst Defamation [GLAAD], 2001). The farther the\nstory traveled, the more race disappeared.\nAlthough most regional press stories tacitly noted\nMartinez\u2019s Navajo identity, few articles considered it more\nthan a supplementary detail. The controversy instead\nfocused on whether the case constituted a hate crime and,\nif so, whether it was motivated by homophobia or trans-\nphobia; either way, race was deemed largely inconse-\nquential. Although Martinez\u2019s mother, Pauline Mitchell,\nrepeatedly described racism as a factor in her son\u2019s death\nand the subsequent legal proceedings, this perspective\nwas mostly absent from the press coverage. Aside from\npublic statements made by the Two Spirit Society of\nColorado (which were mainly ignored in the mainstream\npress), even victim advocacy groups did not specifically\ndiscuss race.15 In almost all accounts, sexuality and gender\n13 Technically, the Ethnic Intimidation Act (1988) did not,\nat that time, include the term hate crime, but it effectively\nserved the same purpose. Where crimes were shown to be\nmotivated by particular forms of bias, stiffer criminal\npenalties could be applied (Ethnic Intimidation Act).\n14 In every annual legislative session since 1994, lobbyists\nhad introduced legislation that would enhance penalties for\nviolence motivated by prejudice against the victim\u2019s sexual\norientation, but the bills were defeated each time (TG\nCrossroads, 2002).\n15 Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD),\na media advocacy group that assessed press coverage of the\ncase, did criticize news media that did not include\nMartinez\u2019s Navajo identity in their coverage. However, the\norganization nonetheless did not make race a central point\nof analysis.\nSEXUALITY RESEARCH & SOCIAL POLICY\nconsistently eclipsed race as an important factor in the\ncrime. By the time the Martinez case reached the TDOR\nwebsite, the issue of race was completely absent. The\nwebsite currently memorializes the case as \u201cFred Martinez,\nJr. (aka Fredericka, F.C.). Cortez, Colorado. 16-Jun-01.\nBludgeoned to the head\u201d (TDOR, 2007, p. 25, \u00b6 9).16\nA careful examination of the case, however, clearly\ndemonstrates that racialized hierarchies of power were in\noperation before, during, and after the murder. Martinez\u2019s\nmother, Pauline Mitchell, described numerous incidents\nthat she attributed to racism, many of which began long\nbefore her son\u2019s death. Noting that Martinez was often a\ntarget for harassment and violence at school, Mitchell felt\nthat school officials not only failed to protect her son but\nalso frequently blamed Martinez and subjected him to\nregular discipline (Quittner, 2001; TG Crossroads, 2002).\nAs Mitchell described,\nHe was sent home often. I would have to leave work\nto go pick him up because they sent him home so\nmuch. The principle [sic] and vice-principle [sic]\nmade so many complaints. Too many Native\nAmerican kids are sent home from school.\n(GenderPAC, 2001b, \u00b6 13)\nMitchell recalled several occasions in which Martinez\nwas sent home from school for wearing what school offi-\ncials called gender-inappropriate clothing\u2014incidents she\nbelieved were also racialized:\nOne time, Fred went in wearing the same shoes this\nother girl was wearing. They were sandals. Nike. She\ndidn\u2019t get sent home, but Fred did. I complained to\nthe school, but of course they aren\u2019t going to listen\nto me because I\u2019m Native American. (GenderPAC,\n2001b, \u00b6 14)\nRacial discrimination continued in the aftermath of\nMartinez\u2019s death. Although Mitchell reported that her\nson was missing on June 18, the police did not notify her\nwhen the (unidentified) body was first discovered on\nJune 23,17 nor did they inform her of the arrest and\narraignment of Shaun Murphy. Mitchell learned of both,\nafter the fact, from a newspaper (GenderPAC, 2001b;\nLambda Legal, 2001).18 When she complained to the\ndistrict attorney (DA) that it was her right to bear witness\nfor her son at the court proceedings, he claimed that there\nhad been insufficient time in which to contact her\n(Emmett, 2001g). Apparently, however, there had been\nample time to notify Murphy\u2019s family: His mother, grand-\nmother, girlfriend, and daughter were all present at the\narraignment (Lambda Legal). Requesting that she be kept\ninformed of any details of her son\u2019s death, Mitchell was\nsubsequently assured by the DA that she would be notified\nwhen the autopsy was complete. However, the police\nreleased the autopsy results to the media without inform-\ning Mitchell; she learned about the gruesome details of her\nson\u2019s murder in a newspaper (Emmett; GenderPAC;\nHuman Rights Campaign, 2001). Mitchell also expressed\nconcerns that the police had not investigated the crime\nscene adequately. When she examined the site herself,\nMitchell found evidence that police had not removed,\nincluding some of her son\u2019s hair, which was matted with\nblood (Human Rights Campaign). For Mitchell, the\ndisrespectful treatment by police was symptomatic of\nracism (GenderPAC). Describing another indignity, she\nnoted:\nWhen they had Fred\u2019s body bagged, I wanted to\nlook at his body, to make sure. When they showed\nit to me, they had left a bunch of blood and rubber\ngloves with him. It hurt and it made me mad. They\nwere willing to leave these gloves and blood like\nthis with my baby. They treat me this way because\nI\u2019m an Indian. (GenderPAC, 2001b, \u00b6 23)\nLater, when she was at the police station, she noted\nthat \u201call the Native Americans have handcuffs on them,\neven leg-cuffs. But white kids and Shaun, they have\nnothing on them. They can move around freely. It\u2019s just\nnot right\u201d (GenderPAC, 2001b, \u00b6 23).\nMitchell subsequently filed a formal complaint with\nthe governor\u2019s office that her rights had been violated\n16 Although this description is consistent with that of the\nother deaths listed on the website (i.e., racial identity is\ngenerally excluded for all murders noted on the list), it\nremains an important factor in tracing how this narrative of\nviolence become deraced as it circulated in various media\nnetworks.\n17 According to Mitchell, she reported her son missing on\nJune 18, 2001, phoned in to follow up 2 days later, and then\ncalled again on June 23 when she read in the newspaper\nthat a body had been found near her home. The sheriff\u2019s\noffice denied Mitchell\u2019s claims, saying that she only filed a\nmissing persons report on June 23, 2001 (Emmett, 2001g).\n18 According to the sheriff\u2019s office, when the body was first\nfound, its decomposed state made it difficult to determine\nhow the individual had died, how long the body had been\nthere, or \u201ceven the ethnicity of the man\u201d (Emmett, 2001a, \u00b6 4).\nDespite the state of the body, the sheriff\u2019s office nonetheless\nconcluded that the body did not match any missing persons\nreports from the area. According to Detective Kalvin Boogs:\n\u201cEvery one (missing-persons report) that we have received\nin the last year we\u2019ve already ruled out\u201d (Emmett, \u00b6 6).\nGiven the lack of clear identifying evidence, it seems odd\nthat the police would rule out so quickly a missing persons\nreport that had been made only a few days prior. The fact\nthat no mention of a missing youth was made at the time\nsuggests that Mitchell\u2019s report of her missing son either was\nnot on the minds of police or had been ignored.\nMarch 2008 Vol. 5, No. 1 31\nSEXUALITY RESEARCH & SOCIAL POLICY\nMarch 2008 Vol. 5, No. 1 32\nthe person rather than in the social context, we are able\nto ignore our role in producing it\u201d (p. 21). In no way did\nMitchell deny the factors that marked her son as differ-\nent, but she recognized that such differences are always\nrelational; otherness can be understood only against its\nnorm. In this way, Mitchell insisted on situating her son\u2019s\ndeath within its broader social context and thereby called\non collective responsibility for such oppression.\nThe differences that marked Martinez as being other\ncannot be understood independently from each other. As\nIris Marion Young (1997) pointed out, \u201cThe absurdity of try-\ning to isolate gender identity from race or class identity\nbecomes apparent if you ask of any individual woman\nwhether she can distinguish the \u2018woman part\u2019 of herself\nfrom the \u2018white part\u2019 or the \u2018Jewish part\u2019\u201d (p. 13). Likewise,\nwhen a boy is accused of being a fag it is not only his sexuality\nthat is in question, but also his masculinity: He is perceived\nas being not man enough. As Viviane Namaste (2000)\nargued, \u201cGender is a cue used to locate lesbians and gay\nmen\u201d (p. 141). But gender is not simply mistaken for sexu-\nality or vice versa; the two are read through one another and\nconstitute each other\u2019s logic. Even the most hypermasculine\nman will be accused of failing to be a real man if he is gay,\njust as an assuredly heterosexual male will be accused of not\nbeing straight enough if he is in any way effeminate.\nIn the same way that gender and sexuality are\nproduced symbiotically by and through each other, so is\nrace constituted by the logic of gender, sexuality, and\nclass. Martinez was attacked not simply because he failed\nto embody proper masculinity and heterosexuality;\nMartinez did not conform to a certain kind of heterosexual\nmasculinity\u2014namely, White, middle-class, able-bodied\nheterosexual masculinity. Masculine heterosexuality is\nnot a universal, abstract hegemonic ideal; it is contextu-\nally bound, ordered by time and place. Black masculin-\nity, for example, is not governed by the same standards\nas White masculinity. Just as gender is a cue for sexual-\nity, so is race a cue for sexuality, gender, and class. As Gail\nMason (2002) argued, \u201cCategories of gender, race and\/or\nsexuality do not just intersect with each other in incidents\nof inter-personal violence. Rather, they are the \u2018vehicles\nof articulation\u2019 for each other\u201d (p. 61). For these reasons,\nwe cannot say that Martinez was killed primarily because\nhe was gay and transgender but also because he was\nNavajo and poor; this additive approach fails to account\nfor the ways in which the racial and class dimensions of\nidentity are produced by and through the other. Race\nand class do not simply complicate violence\u2014they enable\nit (Razack & Fellows, 1998). Indeed, race and class, like\ngender and sexuality, are also constituted through vio-\nlence (Smith, 2005).\nunder Colorado\u2019s constitutional law. Under the state\u2019s\nVictims Rights Act, the surviving family of a deceased\nvictim has the right \u201cto be informed of and present for all\n\u2018critical stages\u2019 of the criminal justice process\u201d and \u201cto be\ntreated with fairness, respect and dignity\u201d (Colorado\nDepartment of Safety, 1993, \u00b6 2; Lambda Legal, 2001, \u00b6\n3). Shunning Mitchell\u2019s allegations that the violation of her\nrights had anything to do with her son\u2019s sexuality or\nethnicity, the DA stated glibly: \u201cIf you\u2019re thinking that [it\nwas intentional]\u2014don\u2019t\u201d (Emmett, 2001h, \u00b6 13). Although\nPauline Mitchell described these experiences as specifically\nrelated to her Navajo identity, the racial dimension of her\ngrievances was absent from news reports. Even the advo-\ncacy organizations that supported Mitchell\u2019s formal\ncomplaint nonetheless treated race as a secondary factor;\nher son\u2019s sexuality and gender identity was consistently\nhighlighted as the key issue in the case (Emmett, 2001g;\nGenderPAC, 2001b; Lambda Legal).19\nContrary to the media narratives, Mitchell refused to\nreduce her son\u2019s death to a single cause. When asked why\nher son was killed, she stated repeatedly that it was\nbecause he was different (Emmett, 2001f; GenderPAC\n2001b; Quittner, 2001). According to Mitchell (2002):\nF.C. [Martinez\u2019s nickname] had many difficult times\nin his short life. Much of this was related to the fact\nthat he was Navajo living in a world that does not\nhonor and respect different ways, and also that he\nwas Nadleeh\u2014Two-Spirit\u2014and he could comfort-\nably walk the path of both male and female, that he\nwould love differently from most. F.C. also felt the\npain of what comes when your family is poor, but\nvery proud. It is not easy to grow up as Navajo,\nNadleeh and poor. (\u00b6 4)\nMitchell\u2019s statement describes how race, gender,\nsexuality, and class hierarchies collectively constituted the\ncircumstances of her son\u2019s death. At the same time,\nMitchell (2002) refused to reduce these factors to simple\nidentity labels. For Mitchell \u201clabels mean nothing\u2014and\nthey meant nothing to F.C. He used these terms to make\nother people comfortable, not himself\u201d (\u00b6 1). By rejecting\nthese labels, Mitchell eschewed a logic that would reduce\ndifference to an inherent quality about her son. As Razack\n(2001) argued, \u201cWhen difference is thought to reside in\n19 Unlike most reports, GenderPAC did make explicit\nreference to \u201creports of racism\u201d (2001a, \u00b6 1\u20132) as a\n\u201cpersistent theme\u201d (2001b, \u00b6 2) in the police treatment of\nMartinez\u2019s mother and noted intersecting identities as\nfactors in the murder. Nonetheless, accounts of the case\nstill report that \u201cthe dominant theme surrounding Fred\u2019s\nmurder has been his gender and sexuality\u201d (GenderPAC,\n2001b, \u00b6 2). \nSEXUALITY RESEARCH & SOCIAL POLICY\nThe interlocking nature of oppression can be\nunderstood in the particular context that situated the rela-\ntionship between Martinez and Murphy. In an earlier\nencounter on the night of June 18, 2001, Murphy and a\nfriend, Clint Sanchez, picked up Martinez after seeing\nhim at a party and all went out for pizza. After they had\ndropped off Martinez, Sanchez asked Murphy whether\nhe thought Martinez had assumed they were gay (Emmett,\n2001d; Quittner, 2001). This question, unremarked on by\nthe media, is significant because it speaks to the economy\nof desire that arose in that encounter. The question\nverbalizes a possibility that Murphy and Sanchez might\nhave been thought to be gay. In this way, the question\nspeaks to a forbidden desire not only between men but also\nbetween Whites and racialized others. In this moment,\nMurphy\u2019s heterosexuality, masculinity, and Whiteness\nwere simultaneously threatened\u2014with serious conse-\nquence. To be misread as gay is not a trivial mislabeling\nof identity, but a significant disruption of the dividing\nline between self and other. Indeed, false accusations of\nhomosexuality not only are considered slanderous enough\nto spark civil litigation cases but also have been used\nsuccessfully as a defense (known as the gay-panic defense)\nin several murder trials (Ott & Aoki, 2002). Because\nsexuality cannot be dislodged from racial and gender iden-\ntity, this moment of desire threatens to undo the racial,\ngendered, and sexual ordering of Murphy\u2019s social identity.\nIn a context in which White, heterosexual masculinity is\ndominant, the proximity of desire that arises in this\nencounter with the other strikes at the heart of the straight\nWhite male\u2019s sense of self. To maintain his sense of self,\nMurphy had to disavow this desire; he accomplished this\ndisavowal through violence (Pinar, 2003).\nMurphy\u2019s actions following his attack on Martinez\nconfirm the role violence plays in securing a sense of self.\nIn returning to his friend\u2019s apartment and proclaiming that\nhe had \u201cbug smashed a joto\u201d (Emmett, 2001i, \u00b6 11),\nMurphy declared neither shame nor remorse, but pride.\nHis statement was a way of recording what he had done,\nto claim the violent act as his. To brutalize another and\nrecount it with pride is an exercise in identity formation\nthat reaffirmed Murphy\u2019s sense of self as dominant and\nsuperior. Violence radically re-marked the boundary\nbetween himself and the other; no longer could the other\nthreaten to engulf him by desire. Murphy reaffirmed who\nhe was: masculine, dominant, White, whole.\nMurphy\u2019s reassertion of identity through violence\nwas not simply a moment of individual psychological\ncrisis\u2014it was also rooted in broader social forces. Both the\ninstability of identity itself, which drives the incessant\nneed for its reassertion, and the impetus to secure a\nprivileged position through violence are consequences of\nhierarchical power relations. Murphy\u2019s own history, for\nexample, was marked by previous acts of violence,\nrepeated conflicts with the law, and difficulties in school\n(Emmett 2001c; TG Crossroads, 2002). First expelled\nfrom school in the sixth grade and subsequently ousted\nfrom two high schools, Murphy was labeled a trouble-\nmaker from a young age. According to the principal of one\nschool, Murphy \u201cwas considered by state law as a\nhabitually disruptive student. He was one of those kids you\njust don\u2019t know about\u201d (Emmett, \u00b6 11). In a context in\nwhich educational and legal systems respond to problem\nbehavior through labeling, expulsion, and punishment, it\nis not surprising that Murphy projected these experiences\nonto others; institutionalized social exclusion arguably\nbreeds further acts of marginalization. Indeed, Murphy\u2019s\nbehavior extended a pattern of oppression whereby\nattempts by one group to overcome social exclusion are\nchanneled through subjugation of another.20\nFurther evidence suggests that the encounter between\nMurphy and Martinez was a colonial one. That Murphy\nchased Martinez into an isolated area known as the Pits is\nnot insignificant.21 A place where teenagers go to party and\nsmoke marijuana, this zone is marked outside the bound-\naries of the civilized city; it is a space of social, economic, and\nlegal abandonment. As Razack (2001) noted, \u201cThe city\nbelongs to the settlers and the sullying of civilized society\n20 Murphy\u2019s last name, which marks him as bearing Irish\nheritage, signals a much longer history of struggle for racial\nbelonging. As Noel Ignatief (1996) argued, when Irish\nCatholic immigrants first came to the United States, their\nattempts to shed oppressed status in Ireland and attain\nWhite privilege in America meant racially distinguishing\nthemselves from non-Whites. \u201cHaving fair skin made \nthe Irish eligible to be white, but it didn\u2019t guarantee \ntheir admission. They had to earn it\u201d (Postel, 1997, \u00b6 21).\nIrish-Catholic immigrants collectively earned this White\n(working class) status, argued Ignatief, by disavowing the\nstruggles of Blacks in the United States, and by participating\nin the oppression of non-Whites.\n21 The evidence is not entirely clear on this point, in part\nbecause Murphy recounted three different versions of what\nhappened that night (Heidelberg, 2002). Murphy claimed\nthat Martinez attacked him and so he struck Martinez with\nthe rock in self-defense; in one version of this story, he said\nthat Martinez chased him to the Pits, not the other way\naround. In another version, Murphy claimed that the two\nhad met in the Pits, at which point a fight ensued. However,\nthe evidence from the autopsy\u2014namely the types of cuts on\nthe body\u2014suggested that Martinez had run into a barbed\nwire fence while being chased (Quittner, 2001). Moreover,\nthere was no evidence to demonstrate that the fight was\nmutual\u2014Murphy suffered no injuries. By contrast, the\nautopsy noted extreme blood loss and a fractured skull as\namong the causes of Martinez\u2019s death (Emmett, 2002).\nMarch 2008 Vol. 5, No. 1 33\nSEXUALITY RESEARCH & SOCIAL POLICY\nMarch 2008 Vol. 5, No. 1 34\nthrough institutionalized violence. Reflecting this legacy,\nthe Two Spirit Society of Colorado released a formal statement\nacknowledging that Martinez\u2019s murder was not an iso-\nlated incident, but part of the historic violence against\nNative Americans. Mitchell concurred: \u201cI will tell you\n[that] here in Cortez, too many Indians die. They just let it\ngo and nothing is done about it\u201d (GenderPAC, 2001b, \u00b6 31).\nMitchell\u2019s statement suggests not only that the deaths\nof Indians are common (and, therefore, not isolated\nincidents) but also that such deaths are socially autho-\nrized and enabled by the community, the law, and the\nstate. In this light, we cannot isolate Martinez\u2019s death from\nthe harassment and violence that he experienced on a daily\nbasis\u2014acts that were endorsed by school authorities\n(through their disciplining of Martinez) and permitted by\nmembers of the community (who did nothing about the\nharassment). Martinez\u2019s death can be seen as an extension\nof that everyday violence. Alan Cook, an openly gay\npsychotherapist who assisted Martinez following a suicide\nattempt 6 months prior to the murder, noted: \u201cI did not\nunderstand the gravity of [Martinez\u2019s] sense of malaise\nabout his safety. I am a middle-class white male, and I\ndidn\u2019t have insight into the part of the community that is\nyoung and Navajo and gay\u201d (quoted in Quittner, 2001, \u00b6 5).\nAlthough some would argue that the 40-year jail\nterm to which Shaun Murphy was eventually sentenced is\nevidence that Martinez\u2019s death did not go unnoticed, the\nmedia coverage suggested that this response was mainly\nowing to the public outrage over what was perceived as an\nattack spurred by homophobia, not a case of racialized\nviolence. More important, however, the sentence does\nnot call into question the structures of power that enabled\nthe murder in the first place. As the sole bearer of respon-\nsibility, Shaun Murphy became the scapegoat that allowed\nothers to deny complicity. By assigning blame to an\nindividual, the social hierarchies of power that give rise to\nsuch violence are left fully and forcefully intact. The\nsentencing process gives the state an opportunity to\nconfirm the official story: that violence is an exceptional\nmoment, not an everyday one. Doing justice in the form\nof Murphy\u2019s sentence reinstalled the narrative that\nviolence is the act of a lone killer, not the consequence of\na system of racial, gender, class, and sexual hierarchies.\nWhen responsibility belongs to a single perpetrator, the\nrest of us are positioned as innocent bystanders.\nProducing Innocent Onlookers: Spectacle and\nWitness as Complicity\nAs long as violence is attributed to the single act of an\nindividual, the role of the witness\u2014the one who is left to\nremember\u2014is rendered innocent. At most, our duty as\nthrough the pretence of the racial Other in white space\ngives rise to a careful management of boundaries within\nurban space\u201d (p. 129). Indeed, the location of Martinez\u2019s\nmurder outside the city proper reflects this colonial order-\ning of space; such violence further constitutes the wilder-\nness as a place of savagery. Known as a tiny frontier town,\nCortez is characterized not only by deep racial divisions\nbut also by its boundary line against the half-million inhab-\nitants of the neighboring Navajo territory (Quittner, 2001).\nAs Murphy chased Martinez to the outskirts of town, he lit-\nerally drove an Indian outside the bounds of civilization and\ncloser to the reservation. Against a long history of White\nAmericans forcing the Din\u00e9 people from their land, when a\nWhite man chases a young Navajo to the edges of the fron-\ntier, brutally beats him, and leaves him to die, how can we\nnot see this encounter as a colonial?22\nIndeed, Mitchell understood her son\u2019s death in this\ncontext: not as a singular attack by one individual against\nher son, but as part of a long history of colonial oppression.\nThe sexualized, racialized, and gendered dimensions of\nthe violence that Martinez experienced are certainly\nconsistent with the legacy of colonization. As Andrea Smith\n(2005) powerfully demonstrated, sexualized violence is\ndeeply embedded in, as well as constitutive of, colonial\nrelationships. Colonization required careful management\nof gender and sexual relations, a task achieved largely\n22 Navajo history is characterized by government-inflicted\ndisplacement, abuse, and environmental racism. Most\nnotably, in 1864, the Navajo were interned by Colonel\nChristopher Carson at Fort Defiance, Arizona, and then\nforce-marched, in what is known as the Long Walk, 300\nmiles in mid-winter to Bosque Redondo, New Mexico\n(Churchill, 1998; Iverson, 2002). Confined there for 4\nyears, the Navajo endured substandard living conditions,\nabject poverty, and starvation. By conservative estimates,\nthe Din\u00e9 lost half of their population during this ordeal\n(Churchill). Although the Navajo people eventually were\npermitted to return to a reduced area of their territory, the\nU.S. government continued to exercise colonial control over\nthe territory through economic exploitation. In the 1940s,\ndiscovery of uranium deposits in the Navajo territory led to\na massive mining project in support of nuclear testing.\nBetween 1946 and 1968, more than 13 million tons of\nuranium ore were mined on Navajo territory, resulting in\nradioactive contamination of the local water supply. In the\n1980s, the Navajo Health Authority documented unusually\nhigh rates of birth defects among babies born in mine-\nadjacent areas; other studies found higher rates of miscar-\nriages, infant deaths, birth defects, and learning disabilities\n(Churchill). Under the Navajo-Hopi Relocation Act of 1974,\nthe United States sought to remove 13,000 Din\u00e9 from the\nBig Mountain region in Arizona to turn the land over to the\nPeabody Coal Company. The history of the Navajo reserva-\ntion was also scarred by forced sterilization and residential\nschools characterized by widespread sexual abuse\n(Churchill; Smith, 2005)\nSEXUALITY RESEARCH & SOCIAL POLICY\nwitnesses is to spread awareness. This orientation is\nreflected in the George Santayana quote that prefaces the\nRemembering Our Dead portal on the Gender Education\n& Advocacy website (http:\/\/www.gender.org\/): \u201cThose\nwho cannot remember the past are doomed to repeat it\u201d\n(n.d.). But as Simon and Rosenberg (2005) argued, memo-\nrialization practices that function as warnings or simple\nobject lessons are insufficient to dislodge our own com-\nplicity in deep-seated patterns of violence:\nOn such terms, initiating and participating in\nremembrance defines one\u2019s own responsibility as\none of educating others (since one already knows\nabout the events in question), a practice that too\noften and too easily slides into a postponement of\nwhat one needs to do oneself. (pp. 84\u201385)\nWithout critical reflexivity, the exercise of educat-\ning others serves to entrench a sense of self that is\nbeyond reproach. Those who know and educate are\npositioned as morally superior to those who are igno-\nrant; we congratulate ourselves for our political aware-\nness without moving outside the comfort zone of moral\nauthority and self-knowing. Such positions of moral\nsuperiority are usually classed and raced: The well-\neducated, supposedly enlightened White subject is jux-\ntaposed against the ignorant redneck, the high school\ndropout, the presumably backwards ethnic other (Ott &\nAoki, 2002).\nOur innocence as witnesses is also secured through\noutpourings of public sympathy. Particularly when we\nare called to remember those whom we did not know per-\nsonally, we are invited into a community of shared grief\nand called upon to experience a sense of collective sym-\npathy. But, as Susan Sontag (2003) argued, \u201cSo far as we\nfeel sympathy, we feel we are not accomplices to what\ncaused the suffering. Our sympathy proclaims our\ninnocence as well as our impotence\u201d (p. 102). In this way,\nsympathy is seductive. By recognizing the pain of others,\nwe tell ourselves, we engage in a shared sense of humanity.\nWe identify with the other through the recognition of our\nown pain. But in doing so, we risk appropriating another\u2019s\npain for our own purposes\u2014or, as Razack (2007) called\nit, stealing the pain of others.\nWhen the deracialized narrative of Fred Martinez\u2019s\nmurder is held up to further the transgender cause, the\npain of colonial violence is erased and usurped and the\nracialized nature of oppression is obscured, allowing\nwitnesses to deny the ways in which hegemonic Whiteness\nis enacted and sustained through violence. In other words,\nin such accounts, the witnesses uphold the myth of White\ninnocence. Perpetuating this narrative of power, the\nwitnesses are also constituted by it; in this sense, the\nwitnesses become White. This process of White witness-\ning is, of course, never stable or absolute, particularly for\nracialized witnesses, who are already constituted as not\nWhite even as they are ushered into a White narrative.\nIndeed, the social and political effects of a racialized\nwitness engaging in a White discourse (which ultimately\nmarks the further pain of silencing, erasure, and assimi-\nlation), is different from the effects for a subject whose\nWhiteness is being reaffirmed and reprivileged through\nthat discourse. Yet the overall effect is one that enables\nWhite complicity; 23 the narrative allows Whites to deny\nthe ways in which we\/they enable and benefit from the\nongoing legacy of colonial and racialized violence. White\nwitnesses do not have to consider the ways in which\nour\/their daily practices contribute to, authorize, or\nuphold racialized power relations that enable violence.\nSuch witnessing thereby uses the pain of others to reaffirm\na sense of self.\nThis process of witnessing is evident in a remem-\nbrance ritual whereby the living speak for the dead. Among\nthe resources provided by the TDOR website is a set of\nfirst-person narratives. For example:\nMy name is China Zainal (CHI-na zy-NALL), and I\nwas a forty-six year old Indonesian-born sex worker\nliving in Sydney, Australia. On November thirtieth\nof two thousand and three, two witnesses saw me\nstaggering down one street before collapsing in\nanother. They called an ambulance, which took me\nto St Vincent\u2019s Hospital. I died at the hospital from\nnine stab wounds to the neck and upper torso.\n(TDOR, 2004a, p. 1)\nI\u2019m Myl\u00e8ne [mee-LEN], a 38 year old transsexual\nborn in Ecuador, and living in France. On March\n26th, my body was discovered in a room in a hotel\nnear the center of Marseilles [mar-SAY]. My throat\nwas cut \u2014 as were my genitals. (TDOR, 2005a, p. 2)\nMy name is unknown, but I was Chinese or East\nMalaysian, and living in Kuala Lumpur. On the 11th\nof November, my body was found head-first in a\n23 By complicity, I do not mean to suggest direct involve-\nment or intentional collaboration with acts of violence;\nrather, I refer to less visible and more mundane actions\nthat nonetheless contribute to structural injustice or\nperpetuate social processes that enable violence. If violence\nis socially produced, then responsibility must be socially\nenacted. I am not saying that responsibility is equally\nshared, but suggesting that it cannot be reduced to individ-\nual accountability or simple questions of moral obligation.\nRather, responsibility must be structurally oriented,\nsocially connected, and collectively enacted (Veitch, 2007;\nYoung, 2006). \nMarch 2008 Vol. 5, No. 1 35\nSEXUALITY RESEARCH & SOCIAL POLICY\nMarch 2008 Vol. 5, No. 1 36\ngarbage bin, wearing a dark T-shirt, white shorts\nand padded bra. Police revealed that there was a\nsingle slash wound on the neck and numerous\nbruises on my body. (TDOR, 2005a, p. 4)\nPresumably, these biographies are designed to be\nread at vigils in order to make individual deaths more\nreal to those bearing witness. But what does it mean to\nspeak for the dead in this way? Is this how these indi-\nviduals would want to be memorialized, by the grue-\nsome details of their death? In taking the voice of the\nother as our own, we colonize the bodies of the dead.\nThese narratives speak not to the honoring of life, but to\nthe fetishization of death. Once again, the violent act\nitself\u2014and not the social conditions that facilitate vio-\nlence\u2014takes center stage. The details of these killings\npander to an imagination that is enticed by images of\nshock and suffering. Thus, death becomes spectacle and\nthe horror of violence eclipses the humanity of those\nwho have died.\nThe spectacle of violence undermines the antivio-\nlence cause by sensationalizing brutality, objectifying the\ndead, and exploiting raw emotion. This is not to minimize\nthe importance of mourning and grief, particularly for\nthose who have lost a loved one\u2014rituals of remembrance\ncan be important practices of healing and support.\nHowever, the closeness of pain that arises from personal\ngrief cannot be confused with the distanced emotions that\nare generated through the consumption of spectacles of\nviolence. As Simon, Di Paolantonio, and Clamen (2005)\nnoted, spectacle \u201cis not a thing, it is not an event or even\na particular representation of an event.\u2026Rather specta-\ncle is a particular mode of attentiveness.\u2026It is a way of\nentering the significations of social\u201d (p. 143). Through\nthis mode of attentiveness, we experience the narrative of\nviolence while still maintaining a position of exteriority:\nThe projections and identifications made within\nspectacle, and the consequent defences it elicits,\nboth require and enact leaving ourselves intact, at\na distance, protected from being called into question\nand altered through our engagement with the\nstories of others\u2026Our attentiveness while not\n\u201cinactive,\u201d is compliant; it does not engage in the\npraxis of making and re-making our historical\nconsciousness. (Simon et al., p. 144)\nAs Martinot and Sexton (2003) argued, \u201cSpectacle is\na form of camouflage. It does not conceal anything; it\nsimply renders it unrecognizable. One looks at it and does\nnot see it\u201d (p. 174). One might look at Martinez as Navajo,\nbut not see the way in which his murder is racialized. In\nthis way, spectacle invites us to read particular narratives\n\u201con the terms of the moral certainties we hold dear,\nallow[ing] us to disavow any requirement that the terms\non which we are moved might throw ourselves into\nquestion, into destabilization\u201d (Simon et al., 2005, p. 144).\nThis process constructs the gaze as innocent, one that is\nfascinated, pleasured; the onlooker is overcome by both\ngrief and gratification\u2014but, either way, the witness bears\nno responsibility.\nIn this context, evoking sympathy serves to advance\nthe agenda of a privileged few at the expense of others. As\nRoss described TDOR,\nIt sure makes for a powerful street performance:\ncandles, tears, hugs, and snuggles over cardboard\npictures of butchered members of a marginalized\nminority produces emotionally charged images. But\nit functions, both theatrically and politically, to\nbenefit a privileged subsection of the trans com-\nmunity. (quoted in Namaste, 2005, pp. 92\u201393)\nSuch practices have concrete material consequences.\nAs Jacob Hale (1998) argued, \u201cWhen a border zone\ndenizen\u2019s corpse is claimed by those with firmer categor-\nical location, border zones become less habitable for those\nwho are trying to live in the nearly unspeakable spaces\ncreated by overlapping margins of distinct categories\u201d \n(p. 319). In other words, when the complexity of identity\nis denied or ignored for political gain, those whose lives\ndo not conform to easily politicizable identities have even\nless space in which to express themselves, make political\nclaims, and confront oppression.\nRemembrance practices also inform the political\npriorities of social movements, generating further mate-\nrial consequences. Because remembrance narratives\ndefine problems of violence on certain terms, they directly\ninfluence the kinds of solutions proposed in response.\nFor example, when the bulk of an advocacy group\u2019s funds\nare used to lobby for hate crime legislation rather than to\nadvocate for transgender prisoners, or for increased\ncommunity policing rather than decriminalization of sex\nwork, or for corporate employee benefits rather than\nuniversal health care, it is often low-income people of\ncolor who lose. For this reason, activists have an obliga-\ntion to continuously examine how their political strategies\naffect those who are most disenfranchised. If the most\nprivileged within the community benefit at the expense of\nthe most marginalized, such strategies are not worth\npursuing.\nConclusion: Remembering Otherwise\nThe narrative erasure of racialized violence in the\nTDOR\/Remembering Our Dead project is arguably not\nisolated, but symptomatic of broader racial hierarchies\nwithin transgender politics. The first National Survey of\nSEXUALITY RESEARCH & SOCIAL POLICY\ndisplaced by gender, its deployment will inevitably fail as\na political strategy because such a usage denies the inter-\nlocking character of hierarchical systems of oppression\n(Razack & Fellows, 1998). I am suggesting not that trans\nidentity should be abandoned as a basis for political-\norganizing but that its usage must be recuperated from a\nderacializing logic. Given propensities among trans\nactivists to contest binaries between masculinity and\nfemininity, surely there is ample room to rethink experi-\nences of violence beyond either-or categories.\nAlthough this article traced a single murder case to\nshow how its inclusion within TDOR was predicated on a\nderacialized narrative, I would argue that the same process\nof tracing race can be undertaken for each case. By reduc-\ning violence to a single cause, the TDOR\/Remembering\nOur Dead project not only obscures the social, political,\nand historical context of violence but also forecloses on the\npossibilities for resistance. When justice is reduced to\nmounting simple awareness campaigns on the one hand,\nor calling for stiffer sentences on the other, we fail to\naddress the structures of power that enable violence in its\neveryday and mundane forms. Underlying these responses\nis a liberal plea for tolerance\u2014a plea that locates violence\nin the sphere of individual attitudes. These strategies not\nonly create an environment of competing marginalities but\nalso limit the possibilities for meaningful political\nsolidarity. When violence is reduced to transphobia alone,\nonly those who identify as transgender can have a real\nstake in trans politics; others who take up the cause can\ndo so only from a position of charity or from a basis of\nsympathy rather than shared struggle and collective\nresponsibility. Such a delineation limits the possibility\nfor political affinities grounded in an understanding that\noppressions are inextricably linked.\nDespite these critiques, I am not suggesting that we\nshould cease remembering those who are commemorated\nby the Remembering Our Dead project. As Simon (2005)\nnoted, \u201cThe task of working for social transformation is not\nto forget the past, but to remember it otherwise\u201d (p. 9). The\nquestion, then, is How do we remember otherwise? What\nwould it mean to remember in such a way that confronts\nstructural violence (i.e., processes of domination that are\nsocially, politically, and economically instituted over time)\nand requires examination of our own complicity? Simon\nprovided a useful starting point:\nRemembering otherwise will proceed from those\npractices of remembrance whose over-riding\nconsideration is the question of what it might mean\nto take the memories of other (memories formed in\nother times and spaces) into our lives and so live as\nthough the lives of others mattered. (p. 9)\nTransgender Violence (Wilchins, Lombardi, Priesing, &\nMalour, 1997) in the United States, for example, failed to\nadequately discuss race. Although the racial identity of\nvictims and perpetrators were included in the data\ncollection, this information was obscured by the paper\u2019s\noverall analysis, which isolated transphobia from other\nfactors (Moran & Sharpe, 2004; Wilchins et al., 1997).\nLikewise, the story line of Boys Don\u2019t Cry, the award-\nwinning film about Brandon Teena, was deliberately dera-\ncialized; one of the murder victims\u2014Philip DeVine, a\ndisabled African American\u2014was purposefully left out of\nthe narrative.24 The fact that DeVine was dating the sister\nof Brandon\u2019s lover, Lana\u2014a White woman\u2014as well as\nthe fact that one of the murderers had affiliations with\nWhite supremacist military groups, was deemed irrelevant\nto the larger context of the triple murder (Halberstam,\n2005). When questioned on her decision to excise DeVine\nfrom the screenplay, filmmaker Kimberly Peirce suggested\nthat the racial dimension would have overcomplicated\nthe plotline. In doing so, as Judith Halberstam pointed out,\nPeirce not only denied DeVine\u2019s racially charged death but\nalso failed to recognize how race was a key factor in\nBrandon\u2019s death as well. Such denials of racialized violence\ndovetail with the deracing of mainstream transgender\nhistory. For example, the famous Stonewall Riots were led\nby Black and Latina drag queens, yet popular represen-\ntations of this history are frequently deraced (Feinberg,\n1996). Similarly, some of the most well-known and popular\nheroes of the transgender movement\u2014Leslie Feinberg,\nKate Bornstein, Pat Califia, Riki Ann Wilchins, and\nBrandon Teena\u2014are read as White.\nThe pervasive denial of race within some trans\nactivism calls into question current conceptions of trans-\ngender identity categories, particularly in struggles against\nviolence. As Moran and Sharpe (2004) noted,\nThe use of the term \u2018transgender\u2019\u2026needs to be\ntreated with some caution, having the potential to\nreduce our understanding of the nature of the\nviolence and the experience of those who are the\ntarget of this violence to a uniform phenomenon.\n(p. 401)\nIf the political usage of trans identity requires that\nrace, class, ability, and sexuality be subordinated or\n24 DeVine was removed not only from the narrative itself\nbut also from the film\u2019s original dedication, which read, \u201cTo\nBrandon Teena and Lisa Lambert.\u201d Because the dedication\nreferences actual facts more directly than the narrative\nitself, this decision to leave out DeVine selectively presents\na true-life tale as though DeVine did not exist at all\n(Halberstam, 2005).\nMarch 2008 Vol. 5, No. 1 37\nSEXUALITY RESEARCH & SOCIAL POLICY\nMarch 2008 Vol. 5, No. 1 38\nSuch a response demands \u201can attentiveness to an\notherness that resists being reduced to a version of our own\nstories\u201d (Simon et al., 2005, p. 135).\nRemembering otherwise may require a rethinking of\nthe political uses of narrative itself. Although narrative can\nplay a vital role in giving voice to those who are marginal-\nized, perhaps its deployment in particular contexts comes\nat too high a cost. Perhaps activists and academics must\nfurther interrogate the political logic of narrative, which\norganizes time, place, and identity in particular ways,\nthereby opening up some political possibilities but\nforeclosing on others (White, 1980, 1984). In some\ncircumstances, we might seek out narrative forms that are\nmore open, flexible, and fluid, drawing on narrative\nexpressions that resist totalizing messages or reduction-\nist identity claims. In others, we might reject narrative\naltogether and choose alternative modes of communica-\ntion from which to launch our political demands. Either\nway, we must be attentive not only to the content of our\npolitical claims but also to their form.\nThere are signs of hope. For example, organizers of\na recent Transgender Remembrance Vigil at the 519\nCommunity Centre in Toronto made explicit efforts to\naddress violence against trans people within its broader\ncontext of oppressions. Flyers circulated to promote the\nevent read:\nThe Trans Day or Remembrance ceremony at The\n519 provides an opportunity for trans\/two-\nspirit\/gender-queer people and their allies to gather\ntogether to gain strength, to educated, and to per-\nform an act of resistance. While most \u201cTransgender\nDay of Remembrance\u201d events internationally focus\non \u201canti-transgender violence\u201d we here at Trans\nProgrammes at The 519 are choosing to acknowl-\nedge not only transphobia as a root cause of violence\nin our community, but also to specifically mark the\nvarious forms of oppression in our culture that\nincrease violence and limit protections for many\nmembers of the trans community. These include\nracism, ageism, ableism, stigma against sex-\nworkers, classism and homophobia.\nAlthough the language could go further in acknowl-\nedging the interlocking nature of oppression, the flyer\nnonetheless demonstrates a move in the right direction.\nSimilarly, the ceremony itself made efforts to celebrate the\nlives of transgender people rather than sensationalize\ntheir deaths. Our task, then, is to push these efforts\nfurther\u2014not only with respect to TDOR but also in the\nmany ways we recount and confront violence. None of us\nare innocent. We must envision practices of remembrance\nthat situate our own positions within structures of power\nthat authorize violence in the first place. Our task is to\nmove from sympathy to responsibility, from complicity \nto reflexivity, from witnessing to action. It is not enough\nto simply honor the memory of the dead\u2014we must trans-\nform the practices of the living.\nAcknowledgments\nMany thanks to Sherene Razack and my fellow\nstudents in the graduate research seminar on Race, Violence\nand Law, at the University of Toronto, 2006, whose rigor-\nous discussions contributed enormously to this article.\nThanks also to Transgender Day of Remembrance orga-\nnizers in Toronto and Peterborough, whose knowledge and\nexperiences inspired my analysis.
