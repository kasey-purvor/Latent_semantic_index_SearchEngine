The mental models approach is understood to be generally rooted in the psychology of risk perception and so is primarily individualistic in focus. However, the approach recognises that understanding, knowledge and experience between communication participants is not necessarily isomorphic and needs to be appreciated in communication design. More recently researchers such as Breakwell (2001) and Schlag (2007) have also begun to extend the social dimensions of the mental models approach in light of Moscovici\u2019s Social Representations Theory, and in so doing have highlighted how the approach may take into account such factors as the differences in knowledge and belief systems between people from different subcultures.","cites":null},{"id":18436363,"title":"A new approach to risk evaluation and management: Risk-based, precaution-based and discourse-based strategies.","authors":[],"date":"2002","doi":"10.1111\/1539-6924.00274","raw":"Klinke, A. & Renn, O.

Introduction\nRisk communication has become increasingly prevalent as an area of academic research, with  one\nrecent review accounting for 349 risk communication articles published within the  environmental\nand technological risk fields alone between 1988 and  2000  (Gurabardhi  et  al  2004;  Gurabardhi\n2005). A literature search recently conducted on behalf of the UK Government Inter-Departmental\nLiason Group on Risk Assessment (ILGRA 2002) claimed  to  have  revealed  over  1000  English\nlanguage publications on risk communication in the 10 years prior to the review, providing further\nindication that the risk communication field is clearly  a  vast  and   rapidly  growing  area.  Whilst\nsome academics have attempted  to  trace  some  qualitative  aspects  of  the  development  of  risk\ncommunication over the past thirty years  or  so  pointing  to  how  best  practice  has  evolved  for\nexample  (for  useful  reviews  see:  Fischhoff  1995;  Gurabardhi  et  al  2004;  Gurabardhi   2005;\nKrimpsky date; Leiss 1996; Lofstedt  2005;  National  Research  Council  1989;  McComas  2006;\nPalenchar  and  Heath   2007),   others   have   also   noted   the   systematic   embedding   of   risk\ncommunication in regulation and corporate governance (see for  example:  Gouldson  et  al.  2007;\nHood et al. 2001; Lofstedt 2005; Power 2004; Rothstein et al. 2006).  The  quantitative  expansion\nof  formalised  interest  in  risk  communication  is   particularly   made   apparent   by   the   broad\ndistribution of national and international agencies that have increasingly documented and  advised\non the requirement for risk communication, as well as its role within their own  organisations  and\nfor others (see for example:  European  Food  Safety  Authority  2006;  ILGRA  2002;  ISO  2002;\nOECD 2002; UK Government Cabinet Office Strategy Unit 2002; US National Research  Council\n1989;   World   Health   Organisation   2002).   However,   despite   the   apparent   evolution   and\npopularisation of formal approaches to risk communication opinion can be said to be divided over\nits purpose and suitability. On the one hand it  would  seem  that  many  academics,  public  health\npractitioners, industry consultants and policymakers amongst others variously find intrinsic appeal\nto  the  notion  of  risk  communication  and  see  ever  broadening  possibilities  for   its   potential\napplication. For example,  an  influential  report  for  the  US  National  Research  Council  (1989)\nidentified that growth in government  interest  in  risk  communication  has  been  driven  by  such\ndiverse motivations as the requirement and desire to inform, to overcome opposition to  decisions,\nto share power,  and  to  seek  alternatives  to  direct  regulatory  control.  In  turn,  the  day-to-day\nprovision of risk communication would appear to be seen by many advocates  as  encompassing  a\nwide variety of modes and formats, which on the  face  of  it  are  to  a  varying  degree  seemingly\nfacilitative of meeting these objective concerns.\nOn the other hand, the application of risk communication has  also  faced  strong  criticism  that  it\nmay be adopted quite restrictively and as such be easily dismissed as amounting to  no  more  than\nsimply a form of \u2018PR\u2019 or \u2018spin\u2019. According to Jasanoff (cited  in  Morgan  and  Lave  1990)  many\nofficials seem  to  regard  risk  communication  as  a  codeword  for  \u2018brainwashing\u2019  for  example.\nNelkin  (2002)  has  likewise   observed   that   risk   communicators   have   frequently   presented\nexaggerated claims about the pros of adopting new technology verses  the  negative  consequences\nof failing to do so as a strategic ploy to help resolve risk conflicts. Nelkin also further notes that in\nsuch disputes public and stakeholder concerns can often become reduced to technical questions  to\nbe answered by recourse to \u2018better\u2019 science alone; if any residual fears  still  remain  it  is  through\ninformation   conveyed   via   risk   communication   that   a   resolution   is   to   be   found.   Risk\ncommunication has therefore arguably been marked by its utilisation for perpetuating  beliefs  that\nnew  technologies  are  unequivocally  beneficial  rather  than   for   more   noble   goals   such   as\nencouraging the public debate about their possible adoption and use. Pidgeon and  Rogers-Hayden\n(2007) have similarly questioned whether traditional forms of risk  communication  have  evolved\nsufficiently to accommodate broader social values,  implications  and  visions  for  the  future  that\nhave been emphasised in recent trends towards \u2018upstream engagement\u2019 about new technologies.\nIn light of these criticisms it does seem reasonable to question how far  the  rhetoric  and  ideas  of\nrisk  communication  actually  translate  into  socially  valued  communicative  action  or  whether\nindeed they were ever intended to do so.  But  furthermore,  even  when  risk  communication  has\nbeen implemented in good faith and according to plan, it seems that the possibility  for  \u2018effective\u2019\nrisk communication is far from certain and that in some instances  it  may  in  fact  do  more  harm\nthan  good  (Fischhoff  1995;  Lofstedt  2005).  These  reservations  about   the   \u2018reality\u2019   of   risk\ncommunication in practice therefore raise fundamental questions about  the  very  purpose  of  risk\ncommunication and how its use and utility might, in principle, be conceived. Yet,  seemingly  few\nattempts have been made to try to distil different academic and  policy  conceptualisations  of  risk\ncommunication and to integrate this knowledge in a  coherent  fashion.  One  notable  problem,  as\nMcComas  (2006)  observes,  is  that  whilst  research  on   risk   communication   is   diverse   and\nmultidisciplinary in nature, and thus draws from a well-rounded pool of knowledge and  expertise,\nthe field suffers from few integrative theoretical frameworks which makes it difficult to  centralise\nor to capitalise on this knowledge (see also Bostrom  and  Lofstedt  2003;  Lofstedt  and  6  2008).\nIndeed,  parsing  the  academic  literatures  across  different  disciplines  it  is   not   always   made\naltogether  clear  how  different  theories  and  practices  of  risk  communication   are   connected.\nFurthermore,  whether  in  relation  to  science,   health,   politics,   lifestyle,   technology,   or   the\nenvironment, despite being ostensibly united by a shared language, different  communities  with  a\ncommon interest in risk communication typically seem  to  talk  past  one  another,  perhaps  being\ndivided by their own particular outlooks, understandings and experiences (Horlick-Jones 2008).\nAll this has perhaps exacerbated the problem that the underlying beliefs commonly concerning the\nconceptualisation of risk communication processes and their outcomes are rarely acknowledged or\nsubjected to proper rigour and scrutiny. Hence, as with much risk communication research, a\ngrowing number of often instructive reviews have instead generally maintained an atheoretical\nfocus, with reviewers and researchers for the most part intent on highlighting the most important\nchallenges facing the increasing number of agencies and organisations that suddenly find they\nhave a risk communication problem. This has in turn led to the prescription of \u2018best practice\u2019\nsolutions to help address those particular risk communication problems. But, as has been similarly\nobserved of other fields by Richardson (1996), the adoption of such \u2018toolbox\u2019 approaches\narguably permits risk communicators, analysts and policymakers to \u2018draw from a wide body of\ntechniques without necessarily being aware that the techniques they adopt bear the imprints of\nbroader scientific, political, economic or social theory [or that] \u2026they are permeated by\npower\/knowledge relations\u2019 (p289). Consequently, the prevailing atheoretical understanding of\nthe application of risk communication lends itself to confusion or the possible imposition of\nparticular value frames which mask the effects of power and distort risk management and\nregulatory policy processes.\nAgainst this critical backdrop the remainder of this article addresses the apparent theoretical\nlacuna concerning the constitution of risk communication as advocated and practiced in advanced\nliberal societies. I begin by first briefly outlining \u2018normative\u2019, \u2018instrumental\u2019 and \u2018substantive\u2019\nimperatives for engaging in risk communication, as reflected for example in calls for greater\npublic engagement in risk appraisal and decision making more generally (see Fiorino 1990; Stern\nand Fineberg 1996; Pidgeon 1998; Pidgeon and Rogers-Hayden 2007; Rowe and Frewer 2000;\nStirling 2005). It is suggested that the practical orientation of risk communication around these\nimperatives is connected to more or less implicit assumptions not only of the purpose or function\nof risk communication, but also about how that purpose or function will be brought into effect.\nHowever, these assumptions are rarely fully articulated in terms of existing social and\npsychological theories of communication. What follows is a critical exposition of how the\nconstitution of risk communication may be theorised in light of these objective concerns. By\ndemarcating different interpretations of risk communication within an integrative theoretical\naccount it is hoped that this will help to bring some conceptual clarity to academic and policy\ndebates and empirical inquiry concerning common understandings, intentions, impacts and\npractices of risk communication.\n2. Three imperatives for risk communication[1]\nFirst characterised by Fiorino (1989; 1990), the \u2018normative\u2019 imperative for risk communication  as\nit  is  adopted  here  stems  from  a   process-based   ethic   which   typically   considers   that   risk\ncommunication  is  undertaken  simply  because  it  is  \u2018the  right  thing  to  do\u2019  without  particular\nreference to the ends or outcomes to which it may  lead  (see  also  Pidgeon  and  Rodgers-Hayden\n2007). This view is guided by the belief that as there is a value dimension to risk, and citizens  are\nthe best judge and executers  of  their  own  interests,  risk  communication  should  raise  people\u2019s\nawareness of risk and enable citizens to be party to individual risk decisions that personally  affect\nthem and their communities (see Fiorino 1990; Pidgeon and Rogers-Hayden 2007; Stirling  2005).\nHowever, to the extent that risk communication is thought to be a valued end in  and  of  itself  the\nnormative imperative can actually be seen to be informed by two democratic ideals. The first ideal\ncentres  on  the  obligation  by  actors,  such  as  individuals,  groups,   business   organisations   or\ngovernment  agencies,  in  liberal  democracies  of  Western  politics  to   inform   (Powell   2000).\nOperating on this basis risk communication may be orientated towards fulfilling such functions  as\nthe  \u2018public   right-to-know\u2019,   \u2018freedom   of   information\u2019,   \u2018informed   consent\u2019   or   \u2018emergency\npreparedness\u2019 through the disclosure of information about the risks of hazards to potential  victims\nas  well  as  behavioural  advice  and  guidelines  prior  to  or  during   acute   risk   situations   and\nemergencies.  The  second  ideal  entails  the  view  that   citizens   should   be   involved   in   risk\ncommunication allowing equal opportunity for representation and  participation  in  debates  about\nhow risk is characterised  and  managed  for  example.  Recent  risk  communication  research  has\nindicated and largely supported a general  trend  towards  facilitating  stakeholder  involvement  in\ndeliberative dialogue to help characterise  risk  and  set  risk  management  priorities  and  policies\nwhich represent a cross-section of interests (Klinke and  Renn  2002;  Lofstedt  2005;  Petts  2001;\nStern and Fineberg 1996). From the normative perspective risk  communication  can  therefore  be\nseen as fulfilling two valued roles  that  are  thought  to  represent  the  interests  of  the  individual\ncitizens of a society, but whereas the  first  implies  risk  communication  is  a  process  of  experts\nspeaking out to the public, the second implies  the  process  of  various  publics  speaking  back  to\nexperts.\nIn contrast to the normative imperative, the instrumental imperative construes risk communication\nas a resource or means that may be employed by an individual, group or organisation to help them\nachieve the particular ends they seek. In this context risk communication has often been conceived\nessentially as a corporate survival mechanism that evolved in strategic adaptation  to  the  external\npressures placed on industry following  such  incidents  as  Bhopal  (Chess  2001)  and  Chernobyl\n(Wynne 1989; 1992), the BSE or \u2018mad cow\u2019 crisis (Leiss 1996) and conflict over the  dumping  of\nthe Brent Spar oil storage platform in the North Sea (Lofstedt and Renn 1997). The  value  of  risk\ncommunication is therefore understood instrumentally in these respects according to how it  might\nsupport the particular aims of  an  organisation  faced  with  a  potentially  hostile  environment  in\nwhich different actors vie to realise their own interests and ambitions. From this point of  view  an\norganisation is often specified as the communicator in a \u2018battle for the hearts and minds\u2019 of  target\naudiences such as citizens or government in  light  of  counter  claims-making  activities  by  other\nstakeholders and the media for example (Gouldson  et  al.  2007).  An  organisation\u2019s  commercial\ninterests may therefore dictate that risk communication is utilised in a wish to smooth the  path  of\na potentially controversial new product to market by co-opting stakeholders into  decisions,  or  by\nassuaging public concerns in  the  face  of  criticism  from  NGOs,  the  media  or  other  interested\nparties. For such uses the organisation in question  is  no  doubt  attributed  to  be  the  most  direct\nbeneficiary  of  risk   communication,   and   it   is   largely   from   within   this   frame   that   risk\ncommunication has been admonished for helping organisations  to  reach  instrumental  objectives\nparticularly if it is at the expense of others. However, in so much  as  risk  communication  can  be\nconceived  as  an  instrumental  resource  it  can  quite  clearly  be  deployed  by  host  of  different\nindividuals, groups and organisations for a variety of particular ends. The success of organisations\nlike  Greenpeace  International  in  raising  awareness  and  amplifying  the  controversy  that   has\nsurrounded  the  disposal  of  Brent  Spa,  global  warming  or  the   commercial   development   of\ngenetically modified food crops and other  such  campaigns  is  a  testament  to  this  fact  (see  for\nexample Bakir 2005).\nFinally,  the  substantive  imperative  advocates  that  risk  communication  should  be  utilised   to\ngenerate improvements in understanding and the  quality  of  knowledge  available  when  making\nrisk related decisions. Proponents of this  position  contend  that  it  may  be  possible  to  generate\nbetter decision outcomes by generating insights from a variety of sources with different  points  of\nview that might not otherwise have been accounted for via a purely technocratic or  individualistic\napproach (e.g. Wynne 1989).  The substantive argument therefore  often  goes  hand-in-hand  with\nthe deliberative ideals identified above and reflects a concern that risk communication may play  a\ncrucial role in attempting to close critical gaps between what is known by different actors  about  a\nparticular risk in question and what needs to be known. The  substantive  argument  may  however\nalso become aligned with instrumental concerns, but in contrast  to  purely  instrumental  concerns\nthe substantive imperative for risk communication is conventionally portrayed as motivated by the\nwish to achieve outcomes that favour the general  interest  rather  than  self-serving  ends  (Stirling\n2005). One stated goal of  organisational  risk  communication  preferred  by  some  academics  in\nthese respects is to  help  people  in  society  to  make  health  risk  choices  wisely  either  through\neducation or the advocacy of certain behaviours in citizens (Bostrom 2003). This may occur when\ntrying to help people put new risk information into perspective both for themselves and for  others\nso as to improve their understanding and the quality of risk decisions for example (see Ropeik and\nSlovic 2006).\nThe nuances of the substantive position also come sharply into focus  in  view  of  the  use  of  risk\ncommunication for the resolution of risk conflicts. For example, Fischhoff  (1995)  has  advocated\nthat one objective of organisational risk communication is to facilitate a  focus  within  society  on\n\u2018fewer, but better\u2019 risk conflicts that include the consideration of both social  concerns  as  well  as\nscientific principles (see also Renn 1998).  The implication here  is  that  risk  communication  can\nserve the general good by providing a  means  not  only  for  parties  to  focus  their  attention  and\nresources on what matters most, but also in helping them to figure out what matters most.  From  a\nsubstantive point of view the purpose of risk communication in these respects is the establishment\nof understanding, not necessarily  conflict  resolution.  As  Krauss  and  Morsella  (2000)  contend\ngiven a genuine desire to resolve conflict good communication may  help  people  to  achieve  that\naim through facilitating better understanding, but it cannot guarantee that conflict will be resolved\nor even ameliorated. Even when people caught up in conflict understand the  situation  at  hand  as\nwell as the perspectives, intentions and motivations of one another  there  may  still  be  legitimate\nfundamental reasons for disagreement. But where as  in  the  words  of  Mahatma  Ghandi  \u2018honest\ndisagreement   is   often   a   good   sign   of    progress\u2019,    poor    communication    can    lead    to\nmisunderstanding, which may instead increase the likelihood that conflict will  be  exacerbated  or\nmisplaced (Krauss and Morsella 2000).\n3. Theorising risk communication\nThe normative, instrumental and substantive imperatives outlined above indicate that risk\ncommunication can be conceived as fulfilling a wide variety of objective purposes. However, to\ndate there has been relatively little discussion of how these imperatives may overlap or come into\nconflict with one another, or about the implicit assumptions of communicative action held within\neach of these imperatives.  Indeed, what is not fully articulated thus far is a functional\nunderstanding of how communication actually \u2018works\u2019 and how this understanding can inform\ndifferent conceptualisations of risk communication, its research or its practice. The theoretical\napproach that has arguably come closest to achieving such an endeavour is the Social\nAmplification of Risk Framework (SARF) developed and introduced by Kasperson et al. (1988).\nThis conceptual framework is generally well noted for providing a general understanding of the\nrole of risk communication in connecting risk events and their economic, social and psychological\noutcomes. However, the idea here is not to develop a unified theory or conceptual framework of\nrisk communication, but to outline a theoretically driven conceptual scaffold which may in turn\nhelp to inform present understandings of risk communication in different respects. In light of the\ndifferent imperatives outlined above, and particularly if, as Horlick-Jones (2008) has recently\nargued, responses to risk are not intrinsically instrumentally calculative, but reflect the specificity\nof the risk issue in question and of the settings in which it is encountered, it therefore also seems\nreasonable to concede that no single generic view of risk communication will suffice. Rather the\nconceptualisation of risk communication might perhaps benefit from adopting a similarly\ncontextualised and differentiated approach.\nThe theoretical approach presented is thus organised around a conceptual scheme which identifies\nfour idealised \u2018models\u2019 of risk communication (see Figure 1). These models are conceived in light\nof the normative, instrumental and substantive imperatives for engaging in risk communication\noutlined above and allow for perspectives drawn from contemporary communication theory. The\nvertical axis of Figure 1 conveys the implied communicative intent or driver of risk\ncommunication (i.e. normative or instrumental), whereas the horizontal axis characterises the co-\ninvolvement of different agents in the social construction of risk (i.e. how potential participants\nare seen to be substantively engaged in constituting communicative action and risk meaning). It is\nsuggested that the fundamental orientations of these perspectives along these two axes can\ntherefore be seen to characterise the constitution of risk communication represented by each of the\nfour associated risk communication \u2018models\u2019. These risk communication models are developed\nwith particular reference to the work of Krauss and Fussel (1996) whom have specified different\nperspectives of inter-personal communication within social psychology, as well as the seminal\nwork of social theorists such as Foucault, Habermas, Bourdieu and Luhmann. As \u2018ideal types\u2019\neach of the four models depicts risk communication as constituted in a distinct form that may in\nprinciple help to guide communicative action in a particular context, but which will never be fully\nrealised in practice. Instead, it is contended that these models offer complementary insights into\nspecific aspects of risk communication theory and practices which serve to illuminate the inherent\nstrengths and weaknesses of different approaches, and so each should not be considered in\nisolation. The conceptual foundations underlying each model are presently discussed in turn.\n[pic]\nFigure 1. Four conceptual models of risk communication.\n4. The \u2018risk message\u2019 model\nFollowing the normative imperative to inform, the \u2018risk message\u2019 model of risk communication as\nit is termed here is predicated on the underlying assumption  that  the  environment  in  which  risk\ncommunication takes  place  can  be  compared  to  a  \u2018free  market\u2019  system  in  which  goods  are\nproduced, transported, purchased and consumed. In this environment risk messages  are  subjected\nto a \u2018market test\u2019 whereby well produced, accessible messages will find their market  niche  if  the\nreceiver can process them with little disruption or distraction, but poorly produced  risk  messages\nwill eventually fail (Jaeger et al. 2001). A central concern of the risk  message  model  is  that  risk\ncommunication should accord with a concern for transparency. Transparency has  long  been  held\nas a key component to  modern  democracy  and  public  service  reform  more  generally  and  has\nrecently been upheld as  an  antidote  to  problems  of  distrust  by  helping  to  prevent  secrecy  in\norganisations and by promoting public accountability (Hood and Heald 2006). However, in so  far\nas  risk  communication  fulfils  goals  such  as  being  transparent  and  informative   the   primary\nobjective of transferring risk messages is the reduction of uncertainty. That is to say, according  to\nthis  conceptualisation  risk  communication  can  be  specified  in  quantitative  terms  as  the  free\nconveyance of informational content in risk messages to add or enhance knowledge about risk and\nrisk-related knowledge. The task for risk communicators is  therefore  to  ensure  that  an  efficient\nuninterrupted flow of clear, concise and comprehensible risk information from sender  to  receiver\n(as well as any subsequent feedback) is obtained (see also Fischhoff  2005a).  This  perspective  is\nreflected  in  commonly  used  definitions  by  academics  and   policy   makers   that   regard   risk\ncommunication in a general sense as:\n\u201cThe flow of information and risk evaluations back and  forth  between  academic  experts,\nregulatory practitioners, interest groups, and the general public\u201d (Leiss 1996, p. 86).\nOr as stated by the National Research Council (1989, p. 21):\n\u201can  interactive  exchange  of  information  and  opinion  among  individuals,  groups   and\ninstitutions. It involves multiple messages about the nature of risk and other messages,  not\nstrictly about risk, that express concerns, opinions or reactions to risk messages or to  legal\nand institutional arrangements for risk management\u201d.\nThe constitution of risk communication according to the risk  message  model  has  its  roots  most\nclosely   in   the   \u2018encoder\/decoder\u2019    communication    paradigm    (otherwise    known    as    the\n\u2018sender\/receiver\u2019 or \u2018transmission\u2019 model after Shannon and Weaver 1949)[2].  Following  Krauss\nand Fussell (1996) in the encoder\/decoder paradigm \u2018meaning\u2019 is said to  reside  as  a  property  of\nmessages. That is to say, the meanings of messages are fully specified by their elements,  whereby\nmeaning is encoded in the message and that decoding the message is equivalent  to  specifying  its\nmeaning. Following the encoder\/decoder paradigm in  risk  communication,  risk  information,  or\nmeaning, is transferred via a process in which an abstract risk  proposition  (i.e.  mental  model  or\nbelief about risk) is:\na) encoded in a risk message (i.e. transformed into a signal whose elements are seen to have a\none-to-one correspondence with the elements of the proposition) by the sender;\nb) transmitted as a signal over a channel to a receiver;\nc) decoded by the receiver into an abstract risk proposition which, it is believed, is in\nprinciple isomorphic with the original one;\nd) utilised by the receiver as a means by which to reduce uncertainty and guide action.\nThe receiver may in response to the message act or send their own message and these responses\nmight then be collected by the original sender as feedback. Senders and receivers are generally\nconceived to produce, process and respond to risk messages in accordance with the \u2018rational actor\nparadigm\u2019 (Jaeger et al. 2001), but the recipients of messages are as such substantively disengaged\nfrom contributing to the generation of the meaning of risk messages. If the message decoded by\nthe receiver is found not to be identical to that transmitted by the sender this is thought to be\nbecause: the size of the signal relative to \u2018noise\u2019 (i.e. signal-to-noise ratio) during message\ntransmission is not great enough; the message was incorrectly or insufficiently encoded by the\nsender; or finally, that the message was incorrectly decoded by the receiver.\nTo briefly elaborate on these last three points following Krauss and Fussel (1996): First, in the\nencoder\/decoder paradigm it is assumed that there are often many messages in transmission at any\none time, and that messages are not always transmitted directly between senders and receivers, but\nmay be relayed by intermediaries, or \u2018transmission stations\u2019 to use SARF terminology (see\nKasperson et al. 1988). All communication can therefore conceivably contribute some degree of\n\u2018noise\u2019 to a message which increases the likelihood that a message may become distorted or\nperhaps even rendered incomprehensible during transmission (Krauss and Fussell 1996). For\nexample, individuals make use of multiple sources of risk information in their day-to-day lives, or\ninformation is often mediated by other sources such as the mass media or other individuals they\nmay come into contact with (Alazewski and Horlick-Jones 2002; Wardman 2006). The noise\ngenerated by the prevalence of other messages, as well as the mediation of risk messages by other\nsources can therefore adversely affect the signal-to-noise ratio. This then requires message\nrecipients to fill in missing information that any noise has omitted or distorted and may lead to the\nincreased likelihood of misunderstanding. The greater the signal there is relative to noise, then the\ncloser the transmitted message will be to the original message, and hence the more similar the\nreceived proposition is likely to be to the original one limiting the opportunity for\nmisunderstanding (Krauss and Fussell 1996). Second, information may be encoded incorrectly or\ninsufficiently when the sender omits essential details in the linguistic representation of meaning\ncontained within messages that are necessary to construct the correct mental representation of that\nmeaning. In such cases receivers may necessarily have to fill in missing detail from pre-existing\nknowledge and experience. Finally, even when linguistic representations are received in their\nentirety, incorrect decoding may still arise because the mental representations of the receiver may\ninevitably differ in some respects to those of the sender, which might not be recognised from the\noutset. This variance could be due to different understandings of terms used in linguistic\nexpressions and representations, or the misapplication of those terms when they are reconstructed\ninto mental representations by the receiver (Krauss and Fussell 1996).\nThis communication paradigm serves as a powerful heuristic in risk communication, as Jaeger et\nal. (2001) have observed it is the one most utilised in communication studies and employed by\nrisk managers. Indeed, the encoder\/decoder paradigm is central to the SARF (Kasperson et al.\n1988), which is arguably one of the most prominent theoretical frameworks informing the risk\ncommunication field at this time. Perhaps to a lesser extent the encoder\/decoder paradigm also\nfigures in the \u2018mental models approach\u2019 (Morgan et al.2002), which centres on fashioning and\ncorrecting the provision and design of risk message content in line with the knowledge of the\nrespective parties concerned[3]. Yet, despite the apparent appeal of the encoder\/decoder\nparadigm, and by extension the risk message model, a number of criticisms can be made of its\ndominant position in the common conceptualisation of risk communication. For example, in\ninstances where distortion is likely to occur Krauss and Fussell (1996) have observed that\n\u2018redundancy\u2019 (i.e. the multiple and repeated encoding of messages) is the communication strategy\naccordingly considered to increase the likelihood that messages will be correctly understood (see\nalso Krauss and Morsella 2000). However, this shows the risk message model to be somewhat\nsimplistic in its conception. One notable problem when communicating risk is that encoding and\ndecoding can both be further hampered by the complexity of the risk concept (Jaeger et al. 2001).\nFor example, transparency is often advocated as a means by which to reduce uncertainty by\nincreasing information available to public scrutiny, but according to O\u2019Neill (2002) transparency\nin the form of the full disclosure of information might actually result in information overload for\nrecipients and generate further uncertainty. Furthermore, in many instances there is in fact often\nan abundance of information about risk especially in the news media, but people still tend not to\npay any attention (Renn 2006). In which case, it might be argued that simply providing more\ninformation does not in itself necessarily lead to greater understanding because people not only\nneed the means or capacity by which to be able to judge new information, they must also have the\nmotivation to do so.\nA further concern is that following the conventional wisdom of the risk message model risk\ncommunication has at times unfortunately been construed mechanistically and asymmetrically as\na \u2018one-way\u2019 form of communication from sender to receiver. This is typically interpreted as\nmeaning communication from \u2018expert\u2019 officials within organisations to \u2018lay\u2019 members of the\npublic. In one-way communication the lay public are considered to be deficient in their knowledge\nabout a particular risk issue and that this has to be remedied through disseminating information or\npublicising official viewpoints derived from experts (Fischhoff 1995). But unless those\ninstitutions responsible for sorting and assessing information are trusted then there is little reason\nto suppose that more information (as through greater transparency) is going to lead to the\nacceptance or adoption of a particular risk proposition (see O\u2019Neil 2002). Even when\norganisations are required to be transparent it may be in the reasonable interests of outside\nobservers to withhold their trust, or to deploy \u2018critical trust\u2019 in those sources concerned (Walls et\nal 2004). Risk communication failure according to the \u2018deficit model\u2019 as it has come to be known\nis instead conceived as a disruption or breakdown in the transmission of risk messages from\nauthorities or the miscoding of that information by its recipients. Moreover, whenever there is\npublic doubt or scepticism about the risk information being transmitted this is typically attributed\nto ignorance, scientific illiteracy, or irrationality, which can in turn then be used as justification\nfor excluding others from making a substantive contribution to risk debates (Sturgis & Allum\n2004; Wynne 1989; Wynne 1991). However, as these scholars and others such as Fischhoff\n(2005b) and Leiss (1996) forewarn one-way communication can generate the impression that\nrecipients are being managed, learning no more than an authority wants them to know, and as\nsuch these actions can result in alienating the intended recipients of communications.\nClearly in the face of such concerns the provision of more information through mechanisms such\nas redundancy and transparency is plainly not a panacea for the problem of uncertainty in risk\ncommunication. While the risk message model assumes that recipients form judgements solely on\nthe basis of the message, the fact that people are embedded in complex social networks and\nrelations which influence expectations, commitments and understandings is generally overlooked\nor ignored (Jaeger et al. 2001; Horlick-Jones 2008). One attempt to elaborate on the broader social\ndynamics inherent to risk communication is the SARF first proposed by Kasperson et al. (1988)\nand later elaborated upon by these and other authors (see Pidgeon et al. 2003 for example). In the\nSARF the \u2018amplification\u2019 metaphor refers to the intensifying or attenuating of risk signals during\nthe transmission of information from an information source to transmitters and finally to a\nreceiver. Each transmitter may alter the original message by adding or deleting incoming signals\nand sending a new cluster of signals on to the next transmitter or receiver. The SARF in particular\nusefully elaborates on the societal context of risk message exchanges by indicating that risk events\nare mediated by the interplay of physical, individual and socio-cultural variables. This broader\nemphasis therefore highlights the potential direct and indirect impacts of risk communication on\nother actors, groups, and organisations such as the stigmatising of technologies and public health\ntreatments, or economic losses and wider regulatory impacts.\nIn certain respects however, the amplification metaphor utilised by the SARF is a limited\nrepresentation of the social dynamics that are present during risk communication (see Rayner\n1988). According to the SARF approach risk messages may be imbued with signal value which is\namplified by transmission stations at various stages, but it retains the central premise of the\nencoder\/decoder paradigm that meaning resides as a property of the risk message that is being\ntransmitted. A communicative exchange is therefore still conceived to amount to little more than\nthe combined outputs of autonomous information processors. So although the proponents of the\nSARF try to emphasise the wider social interactions and impacts arising from risk events, and also\nnotably declare an interest in moving critical attention away from one-way communication to the\npotential for two-way communication, relatively little consideration is generally given towards\nelaborating in any great detail upon the social dynamics and influences that may also feature in\nthe co-construction of risk meaning (see also Murdock et al. 2003).\nThese general shortcomings to the risk message model are arguably  because  the  complex  social\nprocesses that may be of interest often do not form part of  the  message,  but  are  inherent  to  the\n\u2018noise\u2019 that is conceived as the lesser part of communication to  be  avoided  or  filtered  out.  Risk\ncommunication researchers and practitioners therefore usually try to uncover or amplify the  \u2018true\u2019\nrisk signals contained within messages and  to  facilitate  direct  correspondence  of  risk  meaning\nbetween  communicating  parties.  Contrary  to  this  view   however,   fields   such   as   discourse\npsychology and anthropology have highlighted that by focussing upon noise and variability in  the\ncontext of their occurrence one might in fact find  a  different  kind  of  order  and  coherence  that\nreveals  specific  rhetorical  uses  and  functionalities  of   communication   tailored   to   particular\ncontingencies and instances of interaction (Edwards 2005). For instance, Boholm (2008) contends\nthat the pragmatics of risk communication demand that in addition to content  and  the  manner  of\npresenting that content, complex social processes of meaning creation  and  interpretation  situated\nin real life also need to be taken into  account.  As  of  yet,  and  despite  its  relative  advances  the\nSARF approach  has  not  explicitly  incorporated  a  consideration  of  pragmatics,  or  indeed  the\nimportance  of   \u2018noise\u2019  more  generally,  into  its  development   and   conceptualisation   of   risk\ncommunication.  The three remaining risk communication models that are subsequently presented\nexpand upon different ways in which the social basis for risk communication may  be  understood,\nand therefore provide a useful counterpoint to the basic tenets of risk message model.\n5. The \u2018risk dialogue\u2019 model\nThe second concern of the normative imperative for risk communication highlighted above  is  for\nthe participation of citizens and other stakeholders  in  risk  related  debate  and  decision  making.\nRecent risk communication research has, for example, indicated and  largely  supported  a  general\ntrend towards facilitating stakeholder involvement  in  deliberative  dialogue  to  help  characterise\nrisk and set risk management priorities and policies which  represent  a  cross-section  of  interests\n(see Stern and Fineberg 1996; Lofstedt 2005). In line with this view, the \u2018risk dialogue\u2019  model  as\nit is termed here considers risk communication as an historically  situated  discursive  engagement\nbetween all those who become  involved  in  a  particular  risk  issue.  In  risk  dialogue  actors  are\nregarded equally and treated like partners allowing them greater responsibility to shape  how  risks\nare managed and share what is  learned  about  them  to  make  a  substantive  contribution  to  risk\ndebates  (see  Fischhoff  2005b).  As  with  concepts   of   deliberative   democracy   no   particular\nviewpoint is excluded a priori and the interests of everyone are considered.\nIn contrast to the risk message model a distinctive feature of the  risk  dialogue  model  lies  in  the\nnotion of two-way risk communication as a collaborative interaction. Participants in risk  dialogue\nnot only have to be responsive to how others engage with them in communication, they also  need\nto  be  responsive  to  other  stakeholders  whom  might  have   different   information   needs   and\nperspectives or insights to offer. A communicative exchange  is  conceived  not  as  the  combined\noutputs of two or more autonomous information processors, but as a fluid joint accomplishment of\nparticipants whom have collaborated to achieve  substantive  understanding  together  (see  Krauss\nand Fussell 1996). That is to say, risk dialogue does not  consist  of  a  set  of  discursively  related\nindependent episodes through which speakers act with respect to  one  another  individualistically,\nbut is an intrinsically social  and  cooperative  activity  whereby  meaning  creation  is  situated  in\nparticular  discursive  context.  Whereas  in  the  risk  message  model  it  is  assumed  that  people\ncommunicate to convey information which may be used by others to enhance  their  understanding\nabout risk for example, in the risk dialogue model although information  exchange  is  part  of  the\ncommunication process, risk understanding is achieved through  inter-subjectivity.  In  this  sense,\nmutual  understanding  is  not  something  that  is  thought  can  be  achieved  purely  through   the\nexchange of knowledge about the world, but is fashioned anew out of the divergent social realities\nwhich participants bring together (Jovchelovitch 2007). According to  Krauss  and  Fussell  (1996)\nsuch inter-subjectivity is also continually modified by acts of communication,  and  what  is  made\nknown  by  what  is  said  is  affected  by  what  is  tacitly  taken  for  granted.  But  because  inter-\nsubjectivity is assumed to be neither implicit in the knowledge participants bring to  the  situation,\nnor explicitly coded in language, for risk communication to be successful participants are  obliged\nto take some pains to ensure that they have a shared conception of the meaning  of  each  utterance\nbefore proceeding to the next (see Krauss and Fussell 1996).\nAccording to this model an inter-subjective understanding of risk and thus risk  communication  is\ndiscernable  in  a  Habermasian  sense  like  other  communication  as  a  fundamental   democratic\nprocess which can provide  a  solution  to  social  risk  conflicts  by  allowing  consensus  between\nresponsible citizens to prevail through communicative  rationality  and  reasoning  (see  Habermas\n1984; 1987). This does, however, require that a number of ideal  speech  conditions  and  \u2018rational\ndiscourse ethics\u2019 are met for successful communication to take place. For example, if  participants\nare deemed to be acting  intelligibly,  truthfully,  trustworthily  and  legitimately  then  dialogue  is\nassumed to function well (Burkart 2007). But if these ideals are violated,  as  they  often  are,  then\nparticipants become involved in discourse where they have the opportunity to  express  doubt  and\ninterrogate the truth of assertions, the trustworthiness of expressions, or the legitimacy of different\ninterests; only when plausible answers are given will  the  flow  of  communication  continue  (see\nBurkart  2007).  Whether  with  regard  to  moral  statements  or   statements   of   fact,   a   central\ncomponent  to  the  risk  dialogue  model  is  that  the  resolution  of  risk  conflict  rests  upon  the\npossibility for agreement on the most convincing argument or risk-related proposition. To draw on\nHabermas this is because through deliberative dialogue arguments can be weighed and  compared,\nproblems are dissected, better solutions  may  be  negotiated  and  substantive  understanding  thus\nreplaces instrumental success as a goal of communication (Pellizzoni 2001). However, as  Burkart\n(2007) observes, substantive understanding is not normally taken as an end in  itself,  but  pursued\nwith the intent of putting interests into reality and allows for the co-ordination of  actions  and  the\nsynchronising of goals on the basis of common definitions of a situation and  consensus.  Drawing\non the \u2018post-normal science\u2019 framework devised by Functowitz and  Ravetz  (1992),  Rosa  (1998)\nhas noted for example that the modern world  has  generated  a  set  of  risk  problems  demanding\nscientific understanding, but which are quite often too complex or ambiguous to  yield  to  science\nalone and so must be opened to wider scrutiny and debate by extended peer communities (see also\nKlinke and Renn 2002). For Rosa (1998), the key question to be addressed is \u2018how  we  [can]  best\nuse our various systems  of  knowledge  to  improve  our  democratic  decision  making  over  risk\nchoices?\u2019 (p40).\nThe conventional wisdom here is  seemingly  that  the  higher  the  decision  stakes  and  the  more\nuncertainty and social ambiguity that are associated with a risk problem, then the greater the  need\nfor risk dialogue. This deliberative ideal therefore offers not just a theoretical perspective  of  how\nrisk communication  might  take  place,  but  reflects  a  normative  imperative  for  what  could  in\nprinciple be achieved by consenting parties. Yet, contrary to  popular  opinion  and  despite  recent\ntrends, engaging people in dialogue about risk though often important and essential to  the  policy-\nmaking process is not problem free and so should not be regarded  as  the  \u2018be-all  and  end-all\u2019  of\nrisk communication (Lofstedt 2005; Fischhoff 1995). Critics such as Coglianese (1997) and  Rossi\n(1997) have argued that  approaches  which  emphasise  participation,  dialogue,  deliberation  and\nconsensus have in practice generally failed to live up to expectations. One notable problem is  that\nthe procedures required to match deliberative ideals can be  extremely  difficult  to  implement  by\nbeing both costly and overly  demanding  on  participants.  It  has  also  been  demonstrated  to  be\ndifficult to secure a broadly representative selection of participants and ensure that  certain  parties\ndo  not  exert  undue  influence  over   proceedings   and   substantive   outcomes.   Campbell   and\nTownsend  (2003)  have  argued  for   example   that   popular   opinions   about   the   commercial\napplication of biotechnology in the UK are more ambivalent than was recently represented  in  the\nfindings of the GMNation? debate  (an  unprecedented  public  consultation  exercise)  one  reason\nbeing that people who were less concerned were it seems less likely to take part in  such  a  debate\n(but see Pidgeon et al. 2004).\nRisk dialogue can therefore sometimes become narrowly skewed by the sectional interests of self-\nselecting individuals or groups  with  their  own  particular  biases  or  political  agendas,  but  this\ncriticism could at least in principle be addressed procedurally. The risk dialogue model is however\nbeset  by  two  further  issues.  First,  as  Pellizzoni  (2001)   contends,   sometimes   conflicts   are\nintrinsically deep-lying, principles and factual descriptions profoundly different and uncertainty so\nradical that no universal reason or best argument may be found. Faced with  such  difficulties  risk\ncontroversies can remain intractable no matter what procedures are put in  place.  Second,  authors\nsuch as Flyvbjerg and Richardson (2002) have argued that reliance  on  procedural  approaches  to\ncommunication  theory  in  the  Habermasian  mould  may  in  fact  hamper  understanding  of  the\nprocesses of democratic social change by neglecting how power shapes discourse in areas such  as\nenvironmental planning. In short these critics  highlight  that  a  focus  on  Habermasian  ideals  of\n\u2018what should be done\u2019 has unduly limited  the  appreciation  of  real  world  practices  in  terms  of\n\u2018what is actually done\u2019 and  the  instrumental  dynamics  which  shape  them.  These  instrumental\ndynamics and the means by which they  act  through  and  upon  risk  communication  provide  the\nfocus of the remaining two risk communication models.\n6. The \u2018risk field\u2019 model\nThe  instrumental  imperative  outlined  above   emphasises   that   risk   communication   may   be\nunderstood in light of the strategic conduct of competing social actors  and  how  they  distinguish\nthemselves, their intentions and their beliefs amongst those of other actors wishing to further  their\nown particular interests. The orientation of risk communication in these  respects  can  be  seen  in\ndefinitions which for example refer to risk communication as:\n \u201cany purposeful exchange of information  about  health  or  environmental  risks  between\ninterested parties\u201d (Covello et al. 1986).\n\u2018Purpose\u2019 in the above sense is typically seen to  be  required  to  distinguish  the  sending  of  risk\ninformation from noise present  during  communication  and  implies  an  intention  to  expose  the\ntarget audience to a system of meaningful signals which may in turn  change  people\u2019s  perception\nof the issue or their image of particular actors (Jaeger et al. 2001). The authors of the  SARF  have\nsuggested for  example  that  symbols  attached  to  message  sponsors  such  as  \u2018big  business\u2019  or\n\u2018NGO\u2019  may  be  included  in  the  transmission  of  risk  messages  and  can   carry   strong   value\nimplications that can both trigger the attention  of  potential  receivers  as  well  as  influence  how\nmessages  are  evaluated  (see  Kasperson  et  al.   1988).   That   other   actors   involved   in   risk\ncommunication  are  considered  during  communication  is  an  important  point,  but   the   SARF\narguably under specifies how context also provides additional cues for parties to generate  interest,\ndraw inferences and interpret other actors\u2019 intentions over and above the content  of  messages.  A\nfurther concern is that the SARF generally assumes that the actors involved in risk communication\nare interacting on a \u2018level playing field\u2019, whereas in fact the resources at each actor\u2019s  disposal  are\nmore often distributed unequally or valued quite differently (Murdock et  al.  2003).  In  short,  the\nSARF generally fails to make an adequate account  of  the  importance  of  context  and  power  in\ndetermining  the  availability  of  opportunities  of  different  actors  to  influence  substantive  risk\noutcomes.\nBy contrast, the \u2018risk field\u2019 model as it is termed here is conceived following the work of\nBourdieu (1977; 1986) and considers risk communication as occurring within a \u2018field of activity\u2019\nwherein the position and social influence of each actor is seen in relation to one another and\nreflects the various types and amounts of \u2018capital\u2019 (e.g. money, knowledge, connections, prestige)\nat their disposal (see Murdock et al. 2003; Schedler et al. 1998). The field of activity may relate to\nsuch varied concerns as the siting of a nuclear waste repository, the introduction of a new\ntechnology or the vaccination of a population against infectious disease for example. Following\nBourdieu\u2019s (1977) concept of \u2018habitus\u2019, although the strategic conduct of actors within a field is\nnot fixed, their dispositions are historically situated, acquired through socialisation and embedded\nin accumulated everyday practice and understandings of the \u2018rules of the game\u2019. An actor\u2019s\npractical sense of how risk communication operates through complex interacting systems of\nbeliefs is thus likely to play a role in influencing the strategy they adopt and ultimately its\neffectiveness. The field of activity is also considered to be interactive and recursively negotiated\nin nature. For instance the distribution of capital is an expression of power relationships, which in\nturn are expressed in rhetorical strategies, which in turn may reshape power relationships. Hence\nrisk communication competence can be viewed as a rhetorical resource, or a form of capital (see\nMurdock et al. 2003), that is affected by the distribution of other capital, but which can in return\nalso be instrumentally deployed to affect the distribution of that capital. That is, the actions that\nare generated by the dispositions of different actors are constitutive of the objective conditions\nand social positioning of actors within a field of activity (Schinkel 2007).\nLegitimacy and trust are primary considerations of  the  risk  field  model  because  these  qualities\nhelp to define  the  boundaries  for  decisions  and  actions  that  are  perceived  as  acceptable  and\npermitted within a given time and  context,  and  when  questioned  can  increase  uncertainty  and\nimpact on an organisation\u2019s resources (Chess 2001; Holmstrom  2005).  A  growing  body  of  risk\ncommunication literature has indicated that without legitimacy and trust the  potential  efficacy  of\nrisk communication activities can be markedly undermined (see  Lofstedt  2005;  Cvetkovich  and\nLofstedt 1999; Slovic 1993). Yet  at  the  same  time  risk  communication  has  been  increasingly\nadvocated as  fulfilling  a  vital  role  in  helping  administering  authorities  to  reduce  social  risk\nconflicts by securing legitimacy and enhancing trust in risk management and  regulation  (Pidgeon\nand Hayden-Rogers 2007). The  power  of  risk  communication  as  represented  in  the  risk  field\nmodel signifies the strategic play of actors within the possible field of activity, and  its  expression\ncan take many forms such as moral advice, ideological manipulation or rational argumentation. To\nthe extent that the risk communicator\u2019s intentions are understood and accepted as  legitimate  in  a\nparticular context risk communication may therefore  be  considered  to  be  successful.  However,\nas  Krauss  and  Fussell  (1996)  observe  following   Grice   (1957;   1969)   and   Austin   (1962),\ncommunication can be considered successful only  in  this  sense  if  the  interlocutor  or  \u2018speaker\u2019\nintended  the  communicative  exchange  to  create  an  effect  such  as  a  particular  belief  in   the\naddressee, and the interlocutor intended that effect to result  from  the  addressee\u2019s  recognition  of\nthat intention. The inherent difficulty which follows is that in order to have a  desired  impact  risk\ncommunication must be enacted in such a way as to try to take account of how  entire  systems  of\nbeliefs will respond, though the risk communicator  does  not  know  the  full  content  of  what  is\nconstituted by what they do, or if what they target will be responsive to fundamental change. \nWhilst  from  an  instrumental  perspective  it  may  be  recognised  that  another  actor\u2019s  concerns\nsometimes have to be addressed in order to meet particular ends, unlike in  risk  dialogue  there  is\nmuch less inclination amongst actors to discuss what those ends should be, or to come to a mutual\nunderstanding about them, without a forceful incentive. The accomplishment of shared acceptance\nof a particular risk proposition may as such be primarily attempted by  processes  of  coercion  and\nsocial influence rather than through being fashioned out of mutual cooperation or consensual inter-\nsubjectivity. The robustness of fundamental  beliefs  and  the  recourse  of  actors  to  instrumental\nrationalities during communication do however both present a  serious  challenge  to  instrumental\ncommunication. In broader theoretical terms this challenge may be understood  as  a  consequence\nof the evolution of present day communication systems or subcultures and their internal  dynamics\nalong particular paths. For instance, in Luhmann\u2019s (1995) \u2018systems theory\u2019 it is  hypothesised  that\nthe increasing complexity of society in modernity has led to functional differentiation,  that  is  the\nclustering of specialised rationales in functional communication systems which each constitutes  a\nparticular social reality and whose complexity isolates  the  system  against  other  communicative\nrealities. These systems are continuously recursively reproduced  and  changed,  but  usually  only\nthrough iterative self-referential communicative processes that select meaning related  to  previous\nbeliefs and rules. Successfully shifting one belief in an  individuated,  or  subcultural  system  will\nnot necessarily bring about a desired outcome because other core elements of the system  may  act\nto dampen the fundamental impact of any movement  or  change  (see  also  Breakwell  2001  with\nreference to Moscovici\u2019s \u2018social representations theory\u2019).\nThis has in turn led to the concern expressed by Boholm (2008) that the possibility for co-\nordinated selection taking place between different actors in risk disputes is particularly low. Risk\nis a relational, comparative and temporal concept that is commonly subject to different\ninterpretations from diverse standpoints; however, as Boholm further contends the diversity of\nthese standpoints is often differentiated by the agency and sovereignty of those parties involved.\nFor instance, one actor may make decisions according to a particular risk rationale with another\nbeing exposed to the consequences of those decisions. Otherwise stated many risk conflicts may\nnot rest so much on debating risk estimates, but the fairness and equity of the technical options\npresented (Rayner and Cantor 1987). In contexts where the risk dialogue model prevails such\npower is diffused by actors allowing all parties equal agency in determining risk characterisation\nand options for its social distribution or mitigation. But in many circumstances different positions\nmay be so entrenched that each actor is reluctant to empower the other party with the sovereignty\nto make decisions over the issues of most concern to them in such a way which might contradict\ntheir own subjective understanding and rationale for action. If, or when, different actors reach an\nimpasse over a particular risk proposition, activity or intention, this places even further emphasis\non achieving greater legitimacy for one\u2019s own perspective in the broad interplay of intentions\nmobilised by different actors in social risk discourses so that agency might be attained or\npreserved. Without high levels of confidence and trust, the relinquishing of agency from one actor\nto another may as such represent a core barrier to the possibility for inter-subjectivity.\nConsequently, the social representations of risk that emerge are generally purposeful and shaped\nby the social polemic that takes place between different actors with the intention of furthering self-\nserving interests (Breakwell 2001). In this way the context of risk communication as represented\nby the risk field model thus delimits the possibility for a unified conception of risk, its\ncharacterisation and consequences, or what might be done whilst at the same time seemingly\nincreasing the perceived need for risk communication to take place. For instance the risk field\nmodel suggests that the requirement for overt risk communication efforts by each actor will likely\nincrease by virtue of the pragmatic value of risk communication in response to the social and\npolitical pressures faced when dealing with risk and how they bear upon the agency of each actor\nconcerned. Rothstein et al. (2006) have indicated for example that the implementation of formal\nrisk communication initiatives may be understood in practical terms as a systemic consequence of\nprivate and public organisations needing to address the potential \u2018institutional risks\u2019 that\ninherently arise from attending to \u2018societal risk\u2019 management. An issue often at stake here is that\nwhen organisations are officially charged with the responsibility for managing societal risks (i.e.\nrisks to the environment or public health for example) problems inevitably arise which put a\nspotlight on the limits of institutional arrangements for addressing those problems and can\nthreaten the legitimate functioning of the organisation concerned. Instrumental mechanisms are\ntherefore needed to preserve the integrity and procedural legitimacy of official decisions and\nregulatory outcomes. Risk communication decisions may thus become shaped by instrumental\nrationalities to preserve the agency of the organisation in question as much as by any normative\nconcerns or incidences of risk that would have otherwise guided official actions (Power 2004).\nIn seeing risk communication as fundamentally shaped by powerful discourses, each with its  own\nsubstantive content as well as  internal  and  external  power\/knowledge  dynamics,  we  may  also\nconsider how  social,  economic  or  political  forces  help  to  shape  and  define  a  particular  risk\nproblem  and  bias  risk  communication  towards  certain  practices   and   substantive   outcomes.\nHowever,  it  does  not  necessarily  follow  that  the  instrumental  use  of  risk  communication  is\nintrinsically \u2018bad\u2019. The success of many  public  health  risk  initiatives  for  instance  may  depend\nupon an organisation\u2019s ability to marshal risk communication resources to promote an agenda that\ndoes not necessarily work against the interests of those immediately affected even  though  it  may\nnot be totally appreciated or accepted at the time. Although risk communication may be utilised as\na  way  of   publicly   rationalising   particular   viewpoints   and   decisions,   the   power   of   risk\ncommunication in  this  sense  may  also  work  through  appeals  to  instrumental  and  calculative\nrationalities of individuals in ways that do not limit the options available to them in obvious ways,\nbut which  enhance  their  capacity  for  self-control.  That  these  discursive  forces  are  not  often\nconsciously or reflexively accessible to practical risk reasoning  on  a  day-to-day  basis,  but  may\nnevertheless steer the way people think and feel about risk is  considered  more  fully  in  the  final\nrisk communication model presented in this article.\n7. The \u2018risk government\u2019 model\nReconceptualising risk communication as a political enterprise allows for the possibility that\nrather than being based on communicative rationality, risk propositions may be appropriated as\n\u2018truth\u2019 through the exercise of power. In this sense the risk field model conceives of power as\nsomething held and wielded by one group over another, but whilst the risk field model\npredominantly focuses on how each actor attempts to utilise risk communication to achieve,\nmaintain or resist sovereignty within a field of activity, the foremost concern of the \u2018risk\ngovernment\u2019 model as it is termed here is in interrogating how the rules that govern the field of\npossible activity are structured and bear upon the dispositions and behaviour of those concerned.\nThe orientation of the risk government model is made with particular reference to the concept of\n\u2018governmentality\u2019 which was first introduced by Foucault (1991) as a way to draw attention to a\ncertain way of thinking and acting embodied in attempts to know and govern the wealth, health\nand happiness of populations (Dean 1999; Rose 1999; Rose and Miller 1992). In contrast to the\nrisk field model this perspective emphasises unintended consequences and the diffuse nature of\npower effects that shape actors and their own sense of self and self interest. As a starting point\nFoucault departs from conventional state-based models of political rule and asserts that the\ngovernment of a population is contemporarily achieved not via the delegated exercise of sovereign\npower, but \u2018through the wide dispersal of technologies of power which are relatively invisible and\nwhich function in discursive sites and practices throughout the social fabric\u2019 (Smith 2000 p283 ).\nFor Foucault power relations do not always result in a removal of liberty or options available to\nindividuals, but may empower citizens so that they may actively engage in free choices and\ndecision-making (Rose 1999). In these regards the notion of governmentality suggests how forms\nof political rule and exploitation are linked to the individual\u2019s capacity for self-control and\nconsiders how freedom, rather than being the opposite of government is one of its key inventions\nand most significant resources (see Rose 1999).\nIn contrast to conventional approaches to risk communication, from a governmentality perspective\nthe prevalence of attention to \u2018risk\u2019 is, following Rose (1999), not seen so much as a consequence\nof changes in the contemporary existential condition of humans and their world, but as a particular\nstyle of thinking which is employed to render the future knowable and calculable. Risk as\narticulated through governmentality is therefore similar in conception to an aspect of risk\nassociated with Beck\u2019s (1992) \u2018risk society\u2019 thesis. According to Giddens (1999) the idea of a\n\u2018risk society\u2019 does not necessarily imply an increase of risk within society, but rather that society\nis increasingly preoccupied with the future and safety, which generates the notion of risk and the\nsubsequent organisation of society with regard to this notion. According to Rose (1999) risk\nthinking forms an individualising logic which facilitates the disciplining of populations by\nrequiring citizens to take upon themselves the responsibility for the security of their persons and\ntheir property. For example, for Rose (1999) the multiplication of perceptions of risk through\nmedia reporting works to incite a continuous self-scrutiny and monitoring of diet and lifestyle in\nterms of the avoidance of threats to health but with especial regard to the individual\u2019s capacity for\nself-control. By mobilising perceptions of risk the dispositions and behaviour of individual\ncitizens may, at least in principle, be regulated at distance and the responsibility for maintaining\nthe health of a population is thus transferred from direct state control to the individual.\nIn risk communication terms the operation of these concerns may be seen in part to parallel\nSunstein and Thaler\u2019s (2003) notion of \u2018libertarian paternalism\u2019, by which it is thought desirable\nfor private and public institutions to influence the behaviour of others if this encourages and\nrespects their freedom of choice. For example, Sunstein and Thaler (2003) have argued that it is\nnot only necessary, but in practice also inevitable that authorities attempt to steer people\u2019s choices\nin welfare promoting directions that would otherwise be restricted by the bounded rationalities\nand bounded self-control of individual actors. In line with such concerns, Fischoff (2005a) has\nsimilarly suggested that as individuals do not follow \u2018decision theory\u2019, so psychological work may\nfind an applied focus by identifying and explaining disparities between normative ideals and the\ndescriptive reality and then aid in the design of prescriptive interventions to help people make\n\u2018better\u2019 (i.e. more normative) choices. Risk communication interventions may encourage better\nchoices by acting upon people through education or upon their environment through better\ndisclosures as an alternative to curtailing freedom of choice through dissuading people from\ncertain actions or banning particular products (Fischhoff 2005a).\nIn a Foucaultian sense, libertarian paternalism and the work of psychology as appropriated\nthrough risk communication may be seen to represent attempts by authorities to problematise the\ndispositions and behaviours of citizens in terms of the way in which they ought to maximise their\nhealth, wealth and happiness. For example, nutrient labels on food products are designed to\n\u2018empower\u2019 consumers and consumer choice. Whereas this form of risk communication might be\nconceived in the risk message model as a conventional top-down strategy to increase information\nand reduce uncertainty for consumers when choosing a particular food product, a governmentality\nperspective would indicate how its effects exceed such imperatives and are in fact part of more\nwidespread and diffuse governmental \u2018programmes of the self\u2019. Otherwise stated, and to\nparaphrase Rose (1999), the power of risk communication is conceived in these terms not so much\na matter of imposing constraints upon citizens as a way of \u2018making up\u2019 citizens capable of bearing\na kind of regulated freedom and responsibility determined and acted upon through risk thinking.\nThe process of \u2018making up\u2019 or \u2018responsibilising\u2019 citizens in the risk government model of risk\ncommunication is conceived to operate following Rose and Miller\u2019s (1992) articulation of\ngovernmentality as an expression of \u2018political rationalities\u2019 and \u2018governmental technologies\u2019.\nPolitical rationalities primarily concern the changing discursive and cultural fields within which\nthe exercise of power is conceptualised and the particular ways in which the exercising of power\nby diverse authorities is morally justified. Governmental technologies concern \u2018the complex of\nmundane programmes, calculations, techniques, apparatuses, documents and procedures through\nwhich authorities seek to embody and give effect to [political rationalities and] governmental\nambitions\u2019 (p175). In this light risk communication must be defined both in terms of how and why\n\u2018risk\u2019 comes to be employed in particular political rationalities and embodied in the governmental\ntechnologies (e.g. communication practices such as food labelling) which give effect to those\npolitical risk rationalities.\nBy linking political risk rationalities to governmental technologies it is possible to formulate a\nconception of risk communication that \u2018connects the lives of individuals, groups and organisations\nto the aspirations of authorities in advanced liberal [societies]\u2019 (Rose and Miller p176). The\norientation of analysis in these respects draws attention to the productive processes and\norganisational constellations through which risk communication, as with other instruments or\n\u2018technologies of government\u2019, generates new risk objects, new forms of risk knowledge,\nsubjective identities, dispositions and conduct. By taking a Foucauldian perspective the focus of\nconcern in the risk government model thus extends beyond linguistically reflected power\nexchanges between persons and groups to the discursive and cultural structures within which they\nare deployed, that is to that which influences the conduct of risk communication conduct. This\nanalytical approach might therefore concern questions such as \u2018how, given the infinite potential\nfor meaning production in social discourse, do notions of risk come to delimit what it is possible\nto think and say at a particular time, what purpose does this serve, and to who\u2019s benefit?\u2019. For\nexample, past critics have been all too aware that the privileging of risk knowledge and expertise\nwas and often still is seen as essential to the success of risk communication (see for example\nWynne 1992). Technical skills such as forecasting, surveying and statistical modelling may in\nmany cases act as influential imagery with which to help persuade audiences of the integrity of\nrisk propositions whilst at the same time limiting the scope of non-experts to define what counts\nas truth or knowledge.\nThe privileging of risk related knowledge and expertise can also be seen to work in other ways.\nFor instance, ever more sophisticated testing methods and investigations employed in the social\nscience of risk perception have made available a growing body of knowledge on the structure and\nfunction of people\u2019s responses to risk. Risk perception research has as such been utilised by\ndecision makers as a tool to support prediction, prevention and remediation through risk\ncommunication interventions and programmes in a diverse array of areas. However, it is already\nevident that the application and evaluation of risk perception research findings has had far-\nreaching effects and implications which perhaps go beyond the original goals of risk perception\nresearchers themselves. Whereas previous scholarly work has revealed that people\u2019s dispositions\nand behaviours in relation to risk are often highly gendered, social, emotive and symbolic, and\nthat theory and methods appropriate to such qualities need to be invoked to produce a valid social\nscience of people\u2019s responses to risk (see Joffe 2003), it seems that the prescriptive lessons often\ndrawn from descriptive explanations of individuals\u2019 \u2018gender\u2019 and \u2018emotional\u2019, \u2018cultural\u2019 and\n\u2018political\u2019 dispositions are sometimes used to marginalise particular contributions to risk debate\nand decision making (see Wardman 2006). That is to say, the construction of subjective\ndispositions attributed to individuals along such dualistic notions as \u2018rational\/irrational\u2019 and\n\u2018objective\/subjective\u2019 embodied in notions of  \u2018gender\u2019, \u2018emotion\u2019, \u2018culture\u2019 and \u2018politics\u2019 bear\ndirect relation to validity claims concerning the correspondence between risk perception, risk\nassessment and \u2018real\u2019 risk and thus their place within the boundaries of legitimate risk debate and\ndecision making. By contrast scientists tend to be considered \u2018rational\u2019 and \u2018objective\u2019 and these\nattributes render their contributions as having more value in terms of competition for legitimacy\nand attention on risk related issues (Garvin 2001).\nFurthermore, risk perception knowledge also plays an important role in signifying the need for\nrisk communication interventions to facilitate the correction and adjustment of people\u2019s\ndispositions and behaviours. As such the real socio-political impact of risk perception research\nmay be observed not so much in the advancement of risk perception knowledge, but rather the\npromotion of a form of behavioural determinism in which \u2018risk perception\u2019 serves as a heuristic\nfor all kinds of social and individual divergence from normative ideals[4]. The social power of\nrisk perception knowledge as appropriated by risk communicators may therefore appear to lie less\nin explaining that which influences the disposition and behaviour of people when at risk, and more\nin the discursive construction of risk arising from the dispositions and behaviour of populations.\nThat is to say, risk perception would thus be considered here not so much an empirical matter of\nfact, but rather as an invention, or social representation, whose reality rests as the result of a\nparticular form of problematisation concerning the government of people within a population.\nSeen in this light \u2018risk perception\u2019 discourse serves as a regime of truth that constructs individuals\nas particular kinds of subjects (Lemke 2004). A Foucauldian approach however steers the\nprospective analyst away from such sterile dualisms as \u2018rational\/irrational\u2019 and\n\u2018objective\/subjective\u2019 implicit to the respective correspondence of different forms of representing\nrisk (such as science or lay experience) and the actual risk reality towards an interrogation of how\nqualities of knowledge and truth are bestowed upon risk propositions and statements as embodied\nin risk communication practices (see also Demeritt 2001; Richardson 1996). For example, as\narticulated through the lens of governmentality the case may be stated that the assessment,\npredictive testing and appraisal of risk perception can in the above sense be conceived as part of\nbroader socio-political priorities for the management and government of populations observed in a\nmultiplicity of areas of the risk society. The subjective qualities that demarcate risk perception\nmay in themselves thus be regarded as representing a risk to governmental programmes and\nprojects to enhance the health, wealth and happiness of populations which need to be addressed.\nFischhoff (1990) has made the telling observation that psychologists, as experts in risk perception,\noften seem most needed by policymakers when a particular aspect of the public\u2019s behaviour\nthreatens their policies. Fischhoff (1990) therefore forewarns that in such cases social scientists,\nand by extension social science, can quite feasibly be put to work against the public interest on\noccasions when:\n- Political aspersions which cast the public as troublesome are simply and uncritically\naccepted by academics, thus undermining the public\u2019s political credibility.\n- Social scientific remedies prescribed to deal with such behaviour shift the political balance\nagainst the public interest.\n- Claiming to know how to explain their behaviour reduces the perceived need to let publics\nspeak for themselves.\n- Assisting policymakers leads to the fortification of their power, by helping them fine-tune\nprogrammes, anticipate and overcome resistance, or guide and legitimise initiatives.\n- Claiming to know what particular publics might want and need without seeking their\nclarification is used to justify current actions.\n- Research findings are misappropriated by policy makers to justify decisions which\nactually disadvantage and disenfranchise the people concerned\nWith this in mind it is interesting to consider that, as indicated earlier, a growing body of literature\nhas generally focussed on the importance of public trust in the success of risk communication.\nYet, by contrast, the risk government model by highlighting governmental forms of power,\ntechniques of surveillance and the regulation of populations instead rather emphasises the\nquestion of \u2018institutionalised mistrust\u2019 of the public in the way that populations are constructed in\n\u2018at-risk discourses\u2019, that is \u2018at risk of jeopardising through present dispositions and behaviours,\ndesired future [outcomes]\u2019 (Kelly 2001 p30; see also Kelly 2003). The ways in which such\nrationales are embodied in risk communication practices does however deserve much more\nresearch attention, but these points serve to illustrate some of the novel ways in which taking a\ngovernmentality perspective may contribute to longstanding debates within the risk\ncommunication field and highlights possible areas for future academic inquiry.\n8. Conclusions\nThis article seeks to bring to the fore some of the underlying rationales that inform common\nconceptions of the constitution of risk communication in academic and policy communities. Three\nimperatives typically employed in the utilisation of risk communication are outlined and a\ntheoretical scheme is subsequently devised to help articulate four fundamental \u2018idealised\u2019 models\nof risk communication in light of these considerations. It is contended that the diverse conceptual\nfoundations underlying the orientation of each model suggest a further need for a more\ncontextualised view of risk communication that takes account not only of the strengths and\nlimitations of different formulations of risk communication, but also the underlying\nknowledge\/power dynamics that underlie its constitution. In keeping with calls for more\nintegrated approaches to the study of risk within the social sciences (Horlick-Jones and Sime\n2004; Taylor-Gooby and Zinn 2006) this article may be seen as not only taking advantage of a\ncross-fertilisation of ideas from a variety of different disciplines, but also for having highlighted\nan opportunity for the development of future risk communication research along the many themes\nidentified above. In particular it is hoped that the integrative theoretical understanding presented\nhere will help to bring some much needed clarity to academic and policy discourses about the use\nand utility risk communication in advanced liberal societies. It is also hoped that it will help to\nbroaden the concept of communication and the scope of empirical inquiry that has presently come\nto predominantly occupy the risk communication field.\nHowever, it is cautioned that this article is not an attempt to explain the full range of risk related\ncommunicative behaviour, nor could it feasibly do so. Rather four approaches to risk\ncommunication are distinguished, namely the risk message model, the risk dialogue model, the\nrisk field model and the risk government model. These models should not be considered as\nproviding a definitive account of risk communication, nor should it be considered that any of\nthese models is wholly inaccurate or mistaken. It is also unfortunately beyond the scope of this\narticle to outline the methodological considerations that would accompany each model. Instead\nthe aim is to articulate the particular projection that each way of thinking about risk\ncommunication conveys and that their differences should be taken seriously in academic and\npolicy discourse because different conceptions of risk communication bear heavily on its practice.\nA more fine grained view of risk communication should in the very least generate discussion\nabout which model is most applicable in different contexts and why, on what occasions they may\noverlap, or in choosing or adhering to a particular model what other considerations might\notherwise become hidden or masked from view in risk communication research and practice.\nReferences\nAlaszewski, A. & Horlick-Jones, T.

Authors\npreviously citing these three arguments have tended to place emphasis on the normative - as\ndistinct from a normative - rationale for dialogue at each stage in risk management and appraisal\nfollowing the earlier concerns of Fiorino\u2019s (1990) work (see also Stern and Fineberg 1996 for\nexample). The conceptualisation and development of these imperatives notably tends to vary\nslightly between authors however, readers may therefore wish to consult the citations listed above\nfor alternative interpretations.\n[2] The encoder\/decoder communication paradigm as it is conceived and articulated here follows\na social psychological approach offered by Kraus and Fussel (1996). This approach differs\nsomewhat in interpretation to that provided by authors such as Schedler et al. (1998) following the\nwork of Hall (1980), which takes a more contextualised view of the encoding\/decoding process.\nInstead, this view of encoding\/decoding is perhaps more similarly in conception to the simpler\n\u2018transmission model\u2019 outlined by Schedler et al. (1998).\n[3] The mental models approach (Morgan et al. 2002) is primarily a methodological approach to\nrisk communication design rather than a way of conceptualising risk communication per se\nthough the authors of this approach have in part elaborated upon its conceptual foundations. The\nmental models approach is understood to be generally rooted in the psychology of risk perception\nand so is primarily individualistic in focus. However, the approach recognises that understanding,\nknowledge and experience between communication participants is not necessarily isomorphic and\nneeds to be appreciated in communication design. More recently researchers such as Breakwell\n(2001) and Schlag (2007) have also begun to extend the social dimensions of the mental models\napproach in light of Moscovici\u2019s Social Representations Theory, and in so doing have highlighted\nhow the approach may take into account such factors as the differences in knowledge and belief\nsystems between people from different subcultures.\n[4] This idea is particularly informed by a reading of Lemke\u2019s (2004) argument on the social\npower of genetic information which places emphasis on analysing \u2018technologies of power\u2019 rather\nthan the \u2018power of technologies\u2019 and their role in defining the particular subjectivities of\nindividuals.\n------------------------------------\nNormative\nInstrumental\nSubstantively Engaged\nRisk Field Model\nRisk Government Model\nRisk Dialogue Model\nRisk Message Model\nSubstantively Disengaged\n"}
