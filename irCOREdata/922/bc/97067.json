BELLOMO\nDepartment of Mathematics, Politecnico Torino,\nCorso Duca degli Abruzzi 24, 10129 Torino, Italy\nnicola.bellomo@polito.it\nP. K.

The contents of the preceding issues are\ndescribed in the Prefaces.7,8\nIn some cases, the qualitative and computational analyses of problems need the\ndevelopment of sophisticated mathematical methods and even new tools suitable to\ndeal with the complexity inherent to the biological sciences. In particular, cancer\nmodeling generates challenging problems which strongly attract applied mathe-\nmaticians.\nAlthough the impact of mathematical models on the biological sciences is only\nnow beginning to be evident, the benefits to mathematics of the need to meet the\nchallenge of the novel problems raised by biological systems have been apparent for\nsome time now and we expect that there will be future exciting developments in\nthe mathematical sciences.\nThis issue presents six research papers which deal with different aspects of\nmathematical problems related to cancer modelling. They follow from the pre-\nceding special issues by focusing on how the modelling approaches have generated\nspecific mathematical problems which will enrich applied mathematics. Moreover,\n1641\nSeptember 29, 2007 9:42 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00241\n1642 N. Bellomo & P. K. Maini\nthey cover the multiscale aspects of the biological system under consideration, from\nthe microscopic level of genes to the macroscopic level of tissues.\nThe first paper by Komarova20 deals with the development of stochastic game\nmethods to model the dynamics of cancer initiation and progression. Possible ways\nto develop a mathematical approach to describe these highly complex biological phe-\nnomena are well documented in the literature in the field of biological sciences.26,29\nThe interest of applied mathematicians in the above topic is ongoing as docu-\nmented in the papers of the first issue16,23 focused on the perspective objective\nof developing a mathematical theory for multicellular systems.4 The paper by\nKomarova20 contributes to the above aim which needs, as an essential step, a deep\nunderstanding of the links between the molecular and the cellular scales focused\non the mechanisms of genetic mutations that generate the evolution of cellular\nfunctions.17\nThe second paper by Bellomo, Bellouquid, Nieto, and Soler2 deals with the\nderivation, by asymptotic methods, of macroscopic equations, at the tissue level,\nfrom the underlying microscopic (cellular) description.3 This paper develops a\nhyperbolic scaling which generates models with source terms related to mutations\nand proliferation rates. This topic was also dealt with in previous issues looking\nfor diffusion limit methods22,11 and is a crucial step towards multiscale modeling\nby identifying the correct mathematical description of living tissues, rather than\nthe heuristic approach of continuum mechanics in which the equations is generally\npostulated a priori. This literature shows that different mathematical structures\ncorrespond to different scalings, and that during the time evolution of cancer tissues\nthe structure of the equations also evolves in time due to genetic mutations.17,29\nReal biological systems are such that even when cells are condensed into solid\nforms cellular and molecular phenomena still play a crucial role.10,12,6 This aspect\nis carefully dealt with in the paper by Marchiniak-Cozchra and Kimmel,24 which\nrefers to the modeling of the early stage of tumors related to genetic mutations.\nThe model consists of a hybrid system of ordinary and partial differential equations\nwhere cell populations develop mutualistic interactions that produce growth factors.\nThe fourth and fifth papers refer to different aspects of the qualitative analysis of\nmoving boundary problems related to cancer modeling. This is a challenging prob-\nlem that was also mentioned in the first issue.5 Specifically, the paper by Wilson,\nKing and Byrne30 deals with the qualitative analysis and simulations of a moving\nboundary problem for a two-scale system where biological tissues are in contact\nwith dispersed cells. Therefore, the model operates at the cellular and macroscopic\nscales. Several important phenomena are related to these types of interactions (free\ncells with tissue) as documented, in a different context, in the papers by Bru and\nco-workers.10,6\nThe paper by Friedman14 deals with the qualitative analysis of moving boundary\nproblems in the context of tumor growth. The novelty of the challenging problems\nposed and analyzed by Friedman is the study of models where the material behavior\nof biological tissues changes in type due to genetic mutations. This paper provides\nSeptember 29, 2007 9:42 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00241\nPreface \u2014 Challenging Mathematical Problems in Cancer Modelling 1643\napplied mathematicians with new research perspectives in a field in which interest-\ning contributions have already been given by Friedman and co-workers,13 as well\nas in the first issue of this series devoted to cancer modeling.5\nThe paper by Kim, Stolarska, and Othmer21 deals with a multiscale approach\nto modeling avascular tumors. The modeling approach looks at the behavior of\nthe whole as emerging from the interaction of coupled subsystems represented by\nmodels operating at specific length scales. The model is focused on the avascular\nstage. The research line on multiscale modeling was initiated by Alarcon, Byrne and\nMaini,13 focused on vascularized tumors, and then developed in a sequel of papers\nas documented in the bibliography of a paper published in the second issue.9 It is\nworth stressing that one of the objectives pursued in Ref. 21 refers to the design of\nexperimentally testable models.\nAll contributions to this special issue refer to multiscale aspects related to\ngenetic mutations. The book by Weinberg29 offers an essential guideline to applied\nmathematicians for understanding the great complexity of cancer, from the onset\nof the neoplastic state to progression through successive stages characterized by\nincreasing degrees of malignancy. The main guidelines are reported in the already\ncited paper.17\nTherefore, the interactions between the biological and mathematical sciences\nappears very deep and links high level research activity in biology to sophisti-\ncated mathematical methods. The mathematical approach needs to be permanently\nupdated to respond to the challenges coming from biology; hopefully mathematics\ncan contribute to the evolution of biology that is foreseen by the scientific commu-\nnity in this century.31\nAcknowledgments\nN.B. was partially supported by Marie Curie Network MRTN-CT-2004-503661 -\nModelling, Mathematical Methods and Computer Simulations of Tumor Growth\nand Therapy; PKM partially supported by NIH Grant U56CA113004 from the\nNational Cancer Institute, EPSRC (GR\/S72023\/01) and a Royal Society-Wolfson\nMerit Award.\nReferences\n1.
