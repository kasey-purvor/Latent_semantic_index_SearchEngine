Attitudes to the system in the early stages were mixed.\nOver time, and with experience of making the system work for them, staff attitudes changed to become more\nbalanced and the potential benefits of the system became clearer to most. The system structured the work of\nstaff, sometimes unexpectedly.\nConclusions: Electronic prescribing systems need to be seen as occasions for change and learning rather than\nas black-boxed technical solutions to identified problems. The evaluation framework allows understanding as\nwell as hypothesis testing, and is recommended for future evaluations of electronic prescribing systems.\nT\nhe introduction of electronic prescribing in hospitals to\nreduce medical errors is now a major element of health\npolicy in the UK and USA.1\u20133 These policies follow several\nstudies in the medical literature on a small group of systems\nthat have shown reductions in various types of medication\nerror, and\/or improved decision making.4\u20136 Such studies have\ngenerally focused on a limited number of process outcomes, such\nas prescribing or transcription errors, and sometimes resource use.\nHowever the value and usefulness of any information and\ncommunication technology (ICT)-based system depends not just\non the immediate functionality provided by the hardware and\nsoftware, but also on how individuals and organisations adapt it\nto their situation and themselves adapt to it.7 8 This socio-technical\nperspective is often missing from evaluations of medical uses of\nICT, which then can only tell half the story. If or when\ntechnologies are effective and useful depends on the \u2018worked\nout fit\u2019 achieved between them and their institutional and\nprofessional setting8\u201310 as recent reports of problems and errors\ncaused by electronic prescribing systems illustrate.11 12\nIn the present study, we evaluated a novel integrated (closed\nloop) electronic prescribing and drug administration system\ndesigned to improve patient safety. Our approach was to use an\nevaluation framework based on socio-technical theory, some-\nthing that has been so often missed in past evaluations of\nelectronic prescribing systems. The quantitative part of the\nframework is presented in a companion paper13 and integrated\ninto this qualitative assessment in the Discussion.\nPARTICIPANTS AND METHODS\nSetting and system\nThe setting was a 28-bed general surgery ward in a London\nteaching hospital. Prior to the introduction of the electronic\nsystem, doctors prescribed by writing onto a drug chart, and\nnurses administered the drugs, circulating the ward at fixed\ntimes with a drug trolley containing mainly stock and some\nindividually dispensed drugs. The new computer-based system\nestablished on the ward included electronic prescribing and\nadministration as well as elements of stock control (see box 1).\nThe technical system (hardware and software) came from a\nsmall, specialised supplier (ServeRx, MDG Medical, Israel,\nversion 1.13).\nWith the new system, doctors prescribed using a tablet\ncomputer (a handheld touch screen device carried round the\nward) or at a fixed workstation computer. The system\nmonitored when patients needed their medicines and prompted\nnurses in preparing a drug round. To prepare for a round the\nnurse worked at a central console with the touch screen located\nat the nursing station and selected patients one at a time. For\neach drug prescribed, a unique drawer in a wall cabinet opened\nas did one drawer with the patient\u2019s name on it in a\ncomputerised drug trolley. Once the dose was transferred from\nthe storage cabinet drawer to the trolley drawer, the cabinet\ndrawer closed and the process was repeated for other required\ndrugs. The patient\u2019s drawer would then be closed and\nautomatically locked. Then the nurse selected another patient\nand the process was repeated. On admission to the ward,\npatients were given a barcoded wristband. During the drug\nround this was scanned by a reader attached to the drug trolley.\nThe patient\u2019s drawer in the trolley then opened and the drugs\nwere administered with details of administration noted on the\ntrolley\u2019s computer.\nAbbreviation: ICT, information and communication technology\nThis paper is freely available online under\nthe BMJ Journals unlocked scheme, see\nhttp:\/\/qshc.bmj.com\/info\/unlocked.dtl\n271\nwww.qshc.com\n on 19 August 2007 qshc.bmj.comDownloaded from \nThe project to pilot the system started in January 2003\nfollowing initial contacts between the hospital and the\ntechnology vendors. It took 6 months to complete preliminary\nwork, including preparing an operational outline, refitting a\ntreatment room on the ward to hold the equipment, installing\nthe equipment and system testing. Brief initial training was\ncarried out using an early version of hardware and software.\nThe system went live on the ward in June 2003 and remained in\nuse until January 2006.\nResearch design\nThe research approach was informed by the socio-technical\nperspective which considers information systems as having\nsocial and technical elements,14 and technology\u2019s characteristics\nand capabilities as being revealed through use.7 15 This approach\nis reflected in Cornford and colleagues\u2019 evaluation framework,16\nwhich is used here (table 1), and is similar to that proposed\nlater by the UK Department of Health.17 The framework is\nstructured as a matrix with Donabedian\u2019s18 19 model for\nevaluating quality of care (structure, process and outcome) as\none dimension, and system functions, human perspectives and\norganisational context as the other. The framework addresses\ntechnical performance, changes to delivery of care and work\npractices, as well as the longer-term prospects of a system and\nits sustainability within organisational contexts.\nA qualitative approach was adopted for data collection,\ncomplementing the quantitative study.13 Interviews were held\nwith relevant stakeholders including nursing staff (n = 9), doctors\n(n = 5), pharmacists (n = 8) and hospital management (n = 4), in\na range of circumstances: some on neutral ground, some while\nthey were being observed on the ward or others after project\nsteering group meetings that we had observed. We also held a\nfocus group session 9 months after the system went live, at which\ndoctors (n = 5), nurses (n = 5), pharmacists (n = 3) and hospital\nmanagers (n = 1) discussed their experiences and attitudes to the\nsystem. We taped and transcribed the formal interviews and a\ndedicated note taker was present at the focus group. These\nprimary data sources were complemented by findings from the\nquantitative study and related project documents.\nThe data for the study was captured by two experienced\nresearchers (TC, EK), who also conducted the analysis using\ndiscourse analysis. Discourse was interpreted as embodying all\naspects of how people communicate and interrelate.20 Using\nFoucault\u2019s works on the relationship between knowledge,\npower and discourse21 as the theoretical basis, data analysis\nwas undertaken by each researcher reviewing interview\ntranscripts for each professional group, and then in temporal\nsequence. The researchers sought to unveil different interpreta-\ntions of the world and belief systems of the interviewees. This\nresulted in a rich narrative document capturing interviewees\u2019\naccounts of how the project and the system had evolved\nthrough time.\nThe analysis undertaken individually by EK and TC was then\nconsolidated by discussion and checked against observations.\nThe work was regularly reviewed by other members of the\nimplementation and evaluation teams, and evolved in the light\nof their comments. Based on this process the researchers\ndeveloped their analysis into the themes reported here.\nRESULTS\nThe electronic prescribing and administration system was\nquickly integrated into the ward\u2019s working practices (after a\nBox 1: Description of systems\nPrincipal elements of technology within the system\nN Central ward-based server computer holding patient and\npharmacy databases and supporting data back-up\nprocedures\nN Automated drug cabinets to hold ward stock in individual\ncomputer controlled drawers\nN Central console for drug selection and trolley loading,\nused principally by nurses via a touch screen interface\nN Two workstations, on the nurses\u2019 station and in the\ndoctors\u2019 office.

of an electronic system 273\nwww.qshc.com\n on 19 August 2007 qshc.bmj.comDownloaded from \nbrief period of parallel running alongside the old paper based\nmethod) and became relevant to almost all who worked there. The\nsystem operated in a live mode for over 2 years, taking 3 months\n(June\u2013September 2003) from initial use to becoming a stable\nsystem. A summary of the findings, structured by the evaluation\nframework, are presented in table 2 and discussed below. A\nselection of responses from stakeholders is given in boxes 2 and 3.\nSystem functions\nThe technical elements all started life with some operational\ntroubles. The tablet computers had several problems: limited\nbattery life; occasional data loss when being connected to the\nmain system; and screens that were too small and dim making\nit hard for two or more people to review data simultaneously. At\none point the tablets were taken out of use, later they were\nreplaced with a new version. In practice, most prescribing was\nundertaken using the two fixed workstation computers.\nA number of desired system functions were not available at\nthe start of the period of use, for example the ability to generate\nand dispatch discharge prescriptions was only available after\nabout 12 months of use. Traditional aspects of decision support,\nsuch as drug\u2013drug interaction and allergy checking, were not\nimplemented by the project team as they were not appropriately\nembedded in the technology. The warnings did not appear at\nthe time of prescribing, only when the nurse was about to\nadminister the drug. However, some features that could be\nconsidered as decision support were included by the project\nteam, including default standard doses and frequencies for\ncommonly used drugs.\nIn the initial period the server computer was often slow and\nwould at times freeze\u2014a problem associated in part with its\ndata backup routines. Other problems were the small size of the\ntrolley drawers and the lack of suitable handles, and initially\ntrolleys broke down. The automated drug cabinet too, while\nfunctioning well, raised design issues associated with the\nergonomics of its use, particularly when it was being restocked.\nFinally, in the initial periods, the sheer quantity of demand on\nthe system for all types of functionality meant that staff were\noften queuing for access, particularly at the workstations.\nAfter the initial period of instability and slow running, and with\nthe release of a new version of the software, the technical system\nbecame generally stable from about September 2003. Once stable,\nthe data processing functioned well. The inbuilt structuring of the\ncore work (processes of prescribing, drug selection and adminis-\ntration) performed satisfactorily for most drugs, but there were\nnotable exceptions. Some important aspects of this work were\nfound to be incompatible with the system\u2014that is, warfarin,\nsliding scale insulin, variable-dose heparin and intravenous fluids.\nThese drugs could not be safely prescribed through the system\nbecause their protocols did not fit easily into the structures\nembedded in the software, such as regular doses at set times.\nThese remained on the system only as a prompt to consult a\nsubsidiary paper chart. Other problems involved antibiotics. The\nduration was set to the hospital norm (5 days) and this could lead\nto doses being omitted thereafter if the prescription was not\nrenewed. It was also some time before it was realised that oxygen\nhad not been put on the system and was being prescribed verbally;\nthis was quickly rectified. Nevertheless, the most important\noutcome for the technical system is that it worked and remained\nin continuous use for over 30 months, producing a statistically\nsignificant reduction in prescribing and drug administration\nerrors but increasing the time taken for these activities.13\nHuman perspectives\nThe principal users were doctors, nurses and pharmacists,\nthough almost anybody who came onto the ward to contribute\nto care was a potential participant (eg, dieticians, physiothera-\npists). Throughout the period of implementation the ward had\nsubstantial support from a specialist pharmacist and nurse\/\ntrainer to work with staff as they familiarised themselves with\nthe system, to answer their questions, collect problems and\nissues for resolution, provide formal and informal training and\nreassure users. Even so, it was a considerable shock to many\nstaff that a system such as this did not arrive \u2018\u2018fully\nfunctioning\u2019\u2019 and that such an effort was needed to support it\nin use. This was illustrated by staff when, several months after\nthe event, they reflected on the process of implementation:\n\u2018\u2018It was a living hell for 6 weeks. Not just because of the\nchange process but because of unstable technology. We\nwere completely unprepared for the degree of change\nalthough we tried to prepare. It is a complete change of\npractice.\u2019\u2019 (Staff nurse)\nAnother nurse made similar comments and added:\n\u2018\u2018Once we got to like the system and we were actually doing\nthe drug rounds electronically, it seemed to stabilise a little\nBox 2: Prior expectations and initial opinions\nThere was a spectrum of views.\nN Positive examples included:\n\u2018\u2018It will enable us to capture our practice, eg, asking, \u2018Tell me\nall the changes done in the last 48 hours\u2019 this will be a huge\nbenefit. It will make audit possible, eg, listing all the patients\non drug X. It will improve patients\u2019 care, drug dispensing,\nreduce risks inherent in paper-based and human systems.\u2019\u2019\n(Pharmacist)\n\u2018\u2018Things have to be paper free. Paper is too \u2018old\u2019. Computers\nare the future.\u2019\u2019 (Junior doctor)\nN Some thought there would be benefits but they would\ntake some time to realise:\n\u2018\u2018The system hasn\u2019t reduced medication incidents but in the\nfuture it should (now there are hiccups). Still the system\nhighlights that drugs were not given, gives reminders of\ndrugs to be given outside normal drug rounds. I see a future\nfor it but work must be done.\u2019\u2019 (Sister)\n\u2018\u2018If and when it is successful then it will be a great thing for\neverywhere. You will get good responses in 3\u20134 months. Or\nam I being too optimistic?\u2019\u2019 (Charge nurse)\nN Others were sceptical or antagonistic to the system:\n\u2018\u2018I\u2019m a bit sceptical. The electronic prescribing system at\nhospital X didn\u2019t work very well.\u2019\u2019 (Pharmacist)\n\u2018\u2018It will cause animosity because the system is based on a\npresumption that human error is wrong and that it happens\noften. For example, the promotion video stresses \u2018you cock-\nup a lot and this is how to stop it\u2019. \u2026 Now I am thinking\nabout what I can and cannot do with a drug chart. \u2026 I\nappreciate paper drug chart more.\u2019\u2019 (Junior doctor)\n274 Barber, Cornford, Klecun\nwww.qshc.com\n on 19 August 2007 qshc.bmj.comDownloaded from \nbit, people\u2019s opinion of it was a bit better and as they got\nused to the system they seemed to have worked with it. They\nmade it work for them. A lot of the staff who have seen it\nthroughout will actually turn around and say no, I don\u2019t want\nit to go.\u2019\u2019\nAttitudes and opinions developed over time and with experi-\nence of the system. The initial period was the most challenging\nand a certain solidarity emerged, with nurses, pharmacists and\ndoctors helping each other and showing a shared sense of being\nin the frontline (box 2). As the system stabilised, and by the\nlater period of the study, almost all participants had arrived at\nmore positive or \u2018\u2018balanced\u2019\u2019 views of the system (box 3). These\nstatements by staff are shown by stage of implementation in\nboxes 2 and 3, and analysed by profession below, showing how\nthe system changed working practices.\nEven after extended use some enduring issues remained. For\nexample, the disappearance of paper drug charts was a\ncommon theme commented on by pharmacists, doctors and\nnurses with their use in practice going beyond their \u2018\u2018official\u2019\u2019\npurpose and serving as a quick method of assessing the clinical\nstate of a patient while standing at the bedside. Many\nemphasised the quick access and general overview that the\nend-of-bed chart provided, even when in the same sentence\nthey acknowledged the frustration of physically locating charts,\nand incomplete, incoherent and illegible entries.\nDoctors\nDoctors generally understood that electronic prescribing could\ncontribute to improved medical practice and the elimination of\nerror. However, they often maintained a strong distinction\nbetween this system with, as they saw it, some major failings\nand problems, and an ideal system. Although the introduction\nof the system had been approved by the director of surgery,\nsurgeons had little involvement in the development phases\nuntil the system went live. One nurse (a sister) reflected:\n\u2018\u2018A lot of doctors didn\u2019t come to training. Even if they did,\nthey didn\u2019t pay much attention.\u2019\u2019\nSome doctors preferred to learn on the job:\n\u2018\u2018I haven\u2019t had a formal training but I picked it up, it is fairly\nuser friendly. And nurses help you a lot \u2026 you can ask them\nquestions.\u2019\u2019 (Junior doctor)\nHowever, after implementation at least one consultant\nexpressed negative views about involvement:\n\u2018\u2018There should have been more involvement from clinicians.\nA single biggest change we had in this ward in 30 years.\u2019\u2019\n(Consultant)\nJunior doctors noted the extra work they thought it often\ncreated\u2014for example, transcribing drug charts of patients\ncoming on to the ward (a task shared with pharmacists), the\nneed for training as they rotated and queuing for access to\nterminals. Some doctors also looked for a greater involvement\nin the design of such systems, and felt that their participation in\nboth design and implementation planning was essential as the\nonly way to achieve really useful, usable and appropriate\nsystems. Nevertheless, most doctors worked with the system,\nsome more wholeheartedly than others, and at times they\nworked round the system by delegating direct use to nurses or\npharmacists.\nNurses\nMost nurses were hesitant about the system at the outset, and\noften feared letting go of familiar aspects of their job such as\nthe bed-end drug chart and the old-style drug trolley. They also\nexpressed a lack of knowledge about computers (some had not\nused a mouse before) as well as fear and resistance to\ncomputers becoming a more substantial part of their job and,\npotentially, coming between them and their patients. At one\npoint during the early period of use the nurses on the ward\ncame close to withdrawing their support for the system, feeling\nthat it placed an intolerable load on them. Following this\nBox 3: Attitudes and opinions 6\u201318 months after\nthe system went live\nN There were positive views about the benefits of the new\nsystem compared with the old:\n\u2018\u2018I like the system. I am now worried about going to the old\nsystem, I prefer this to paper drug charts.\u2019\u2019 (Sister)\n\u2018\u2018Coming from different wards using traditional trolley, and\ntrying to find different drugs in the trolley and maybe finding\na drug isn\u2019t there\u2014something that wouldn\u2019t happen with\nServeRx\u2014in that respect I find it very beneficial.\u2019\u2019 (Nurse)\n\u2018\u2018It is easier to spot problems. Also, it seems that everyone is\nthinking a bit more about drugs, there is a greater \u2018visibility\u2019\nof prescribing and that\u2019s good.\u2019\u2019 (Pharmacist)\nN Others recognised the benefits, but that there were some\ndisadvantages, such as the time taken or the loss of\npatient contact:\n\u2018\u2018Once I started to use it ... it was OK, it is quite user friendly\nand \u2018smooth working\u2019. Quite reliable in comparison with the\nexisting system. From a prescribing perspective it works\nbetter than drug charts. Drug charts go missing, now we can\nsee the whole record of prescribing history, who made what\nchanges, etc. ... . But now the process is a bit different, need\nto put passwords in all the time which is good (security) and\nbad (time).\u2019\u2019 (Junior doctor)\n\u2018\u2018Initially I thought it was quite confusing but that was\nbecause I wasn\u2019t using it all the time. Since I have been doing\nthe ward, I think it is quite good. \u2026 But I find it difficult to\nlook at a prescription and know whether it is appropriate\nwithout speaking to the patient. Which means I have to go to\nthe ward. It is taking me longer. Overall I would rather it was\nhere and I wouldn\u2019t want to go backwards and take it out.\u2019\u2019\n(Ward pharmacist)\n\u2018\u2018I avoided it because I\u2019m here for the patients. My job is\nlooking after patients. \u2026 I spent less time on a drug round\nbut it doesn\u2019t help me to do a better job as a nurse. Before\nnurses could pick up a chart and at a glance see what is\nthere, what happens. In 20 seconds you could see what\nthey\u2019ve got there (on what drugs a patient is).\u2019\u2019 [Then she\nadded] \u2018\u2018When I had to do a night shift it definitely helped, it\nwas quicker, and as you are so tired there is less chance of\nerrors.\u2019\u2019 (Staff nurse)\nEvaluation of an electronic system 275\nwww.qshc.com\n on 19 August 2007 qshc.bmj.comDownloaded from \nperiod, and in response to their protests, extra effort was put\ninto system support.\nMore senior nurses, and those who had more information\nduring the build up to the implementation by participating on\nthe project team, were generally more positive. They saw the\nfuture in this system, with a better, more careful and error-free\nregimen of care, with time saved becoming available for more\ncreative nursing activity. They anticipated and kept faith with\nthese promised benefits, even when the system was at its most\nproblematic.\nPharmacists\nThe system was to a large degree driven by pharmacists. The\nproject was led by the chief pharmacist, and at all stages the\nwork practices and goals of pharmacy were strongly repre-\nsented. Pharmacists interviewed before the system was in live\nuse could immediately appreciate potential benefits\u2014for\nexample, more comprehensive prescription review, more legible\norders with more coherent detail, better adherence to the\nhospital formulary.\nThose who participated in the project directly felt that the\nimplementation of the system had helped to build stronger\nrelationships with other clinical staff, not least through the\nextended period of providing on-call help. In contrast with\ndoctors and nurses, pharmacists also had a clearer perception of\nadditional benefits they could deliver to patients\u2014for example,\nmore time for patient contact, taking drug histories, discharge\ncounselling. However, as indicated in the companion paper,13\ntime spent providing a ward pharmacy service increased. But\ndespite this lack of release of time, pharmacists who used the\nsystem reported perceiving the system as safer and more\nconvenient, with better access to patient data. Some worried\nthat it could reduce patient contact.\nOrganisational context\nThe system was just one of many innovative pharmacy-related\nprojects being undertaken at the time. For instance, shortly\nafter this system went live a new robot was installed in the\ncentral pharmacy. As a pilot project this system was undertaken\nwith the understanding that what was being attempted was\nnew, innovative and worthwhile, but it was demanding of extra\nresources and effort in technical and organisational design,\ndedicated space and individual commitment. The project was\nunderstood within the broader hospital as an opportunity to\nlearn about this particular electronic prescribing system, and\nalso about the potential of future such systems and issues of\ntheir implementation. The project was also seen as a more\ngeneral opportunity for staff, in particular nurses and pharma-\ncists, to become more knowledgeable about new technologies.\nThe system remained in use until January 2006 when the\nsurgical ward relocated as part of a surgical modernisation\nprogramme. The system did not transfer but remained\ninstalled, in the original ward, now medicine for the elderly\nward. Since January 2006, while not in use, the system has had\na series of software upgrades and is currently scheduled to re-\nenter operation soon. Thus the organisational outcome of this\nsystem is still being negotiated\u2014judged as not worth moving\nwith the surgical ward in the reorganisation, but to be put back\nin use in a different clinical context.\nDISCUSSION\nWe present here a structured, theory-driven evaluation of a\nnovel electronic prescribing and drug administration system on\none surgical ward. The system may be seen as successful in that\nit remained in use for an extended period, that users of the\nsystem became increasingly positive about it (box 3), and that it\nwas shown to reduce prescribing and drug administration\nerrors.13 Drawing on this qualitative, and the quantitative parts,\nof the study, the outcome is summarised below:\nN Doctors write more coherent and complete prescriptions and\nthey are legible.\nN Preparation for and conduct of a drug round is a more\nstructured activity for a nurse with individual patients\nconsidered one by one and their medicines systematically\ncollected together.\nN The drug round is more structured with specific attention to\npatient identification through barcodes and a more compre-\nhensive scheme for recording administration.\nN Pharmacists review more prescriptions and detect more\nerrors before they reach the patient.\nN Overall time spent on medication-related tasks increased.13\nThese are stated as generally positive outcomes, yet we need\nto ask how this experience can inform any wider-scale\ndeployment in the hospital or elsewhere.\nImplementation processes\nFirst, these results must be understood as deriving from a pilot\nproject that drew on extra commitment and resources over a\nlong period. If a similar system were more widely implemented\nthis special status would not exist. Managers would need more\nconfidence in the technical components and the functionality\nthey support, and would need to recognise the effort required to\nresolve the inevitable challenges to existing work practices. Put\ndifferently, although the system continued to be developed on\nthe ward, it had not, and we would argue could not, become a\n\u2018\u2018finished product\u2019\u2019 that could be easily inserted into other\nhospital or ward environments.\nSecond, the findings from this study confirm that much of\nthe real work of designing and shaping such systems, under-\nstood as socio-technical ensembles, is undertaken in the local\ncontext and often after initial use, a process of \u2018\u2018in-use design\u2019\u201922\nwhich creates a specific \u2018\u2018technology in practice\u2019\u2019.15 This is a\nnecessary process that needs to be resourced over a lengthy\nperiod to allow for attitudes and opinions to shift, work\nprocesses to adapt and, in the case of a system focused on error\nprevention, formative evaluations to ensure that real existing\nerrors are being reduced and new potential for error is not being\ncreated.\nIn this context it is interesting that doctors chose to have\nlimited engagement with the preimplementation design and\ntraining, which may partly reflect the constraints of being a\nsurgeon. However, they may have had fewer concerns about\nnon-involvement if they had realised that they still had a major\nrole in designing and shaping the system as they used it and\nresponded to its problems.\nTechnical systems structure work\nThe effectiveness of electronic prescribing is often seen as a\nconsequence of the technical elements structuring and con-\nstraining work tasks, providing relevant forcing functions. For\nexample, in this case, in loading the drug trolley a nurse is\nbound into one sequence of events: selection of a patient, then\nof their drugs, then loading trolley drawers and then reading\nwristbands to ensure administration to the right patient.\nSimilarly a doctor prescribing is prompted to complete the\nentire medication order and is unable to omit key information.\nSuch enforcement of standard practice, it is often argued, is one\nof the ways such systems can reduce errors.4\nSuch structuring imposes changes in practice for all those\nwho work with the system. Most, but not all, are seen as\nbeneficial and appropriate, but some aspects of work are then\nleft fragmented and unresolved. Thus the example of loading a\n276 Barber, Cornford, Klecun\nwww.qshc.com\n on 19 August 2007 qshc.bmj.comDownloaded from \ndrug trolley above also reveals some fragmented work\u2014\nsplitting of the preparation of intravenous fluids, leaving untidy\nand potentially error-prone aspects such as referral to paper\ncharts. Similarly, prescribing or administration not undertaken\nas part of regular drug rounds, as when a nurse gives a \u2018\u2018stat\u2019\u2019\n(occasional or elective) dose, now required another work flow\nto log and administer, one in which the nurse walks to and\nfrom the computer twice, once to obtain the drug and then\nagain to record administration. In dealing with the aspects of\nthe system that are not readily structured, new sources of error\nmight be introduced.\nDilemma of structure\nThe structuring thus poses a dilemma.23 In addressing the aim\nof reducing errors in prescribing and administration of drugs,\nthe technology is explicitly used to constrain and enforce a\n\u2018\u2018good\u2019\u2019 process. But some aspects of practice do not neatly fit,\nor are mutually incompatible, and take time to work through or\naround. The structuring may also create wider rigidity, making\nit harder to introduce other innovations related to medicines\nmanagement in the future\u2014for example, one-stop dispensing.24\nSuch dilemmas are apparent on a single ward, but across a\nhospital or range of hospitals the effect would be greatly\nmagnified and each setting would reveal its own misfits and\nfragments.\nConsequential change\nReshaped work tasks bring wider changes in how care is\ndelivered and professionals work together. For example,\npreviously pharmacists visited each patient daily and checked\ntheir drug chart if available; now they can check through the\ncomputer and assess each patient\u2019s computer chart for changes,\nthen only visit those whose records indicate a pharmacy-related\nproblem. The patient is seen through the data, possibly remote\nfrom the ward, and there may be fewer opportunities for\ninteraction between staff, and between pharmacist and patient.\nIs this an appropriate outcome and what will be its\nconsequences? Such emergent changes must be identified over\ntime, assessed and managed when a system is in use.\nAnother example was the loss of the drug chart as a ready-to-\nhand update of the patient\u2019s condition, located at the end of the\nbed. The information given on the chart, both explicit (such as\ndrugs and doses) and implicit (crossings off, the chart looking\nbattered, etc.), was lost from that location. In a narrow sense,\nall the explicit data and functions were translated into the new\nsystem and even improved on (eg, legibility, completeness), but\nthere remained a feeling across the user groups that an\nimportant element of their work practice and of the efficiency\nand integrity of the prescribing process within wider healthcare\nhad been lost. At the same time the computer system did\nincrease the visibility of some errors, such as missed doses. This\nincrease in information was so noticeable that one consultant\nthought the computer system had led to a marked increase in\nmissed doses, claimed the computer was unsafe and demanded\nit be taken out. It was only the data from the quantitative study\nthat convinced him the number of missed doses had actually\ndropped\u2014 they had just been invisible before.\nStrengths and limitations of the study\nOur use of a wider socio-technical evaluation framework gives a\nbetter understanding of the quantitative data in the companion\npaper13 and the extent to which staff attitudes and behaviours\nplay a part in the final performance of the system studied. It\ncan offer others who are considering adopting similar systems a\nbetter understanding of the relevance of our findings to their\nsetting and of issues arising during an implementation. It also\nhelps clarify directions of development for the suppliers of such\nsystems and emphasises the vital need for them to be locally\nconfigurable. Finally, this approach ensures that if a system\nfails to be implemented successfully, the evaluation framework\nstill provides understanding and learning.\nThis type of qualitative evaluation has limitations. It can offer\nno guarantees of universal relevance of findings. The attitudes\nand skills of staff, as well as the existing systems of work, will\nbe different at other sites. Thus the particular socio-technical\naccommodations worked out may be different.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis theory-led evaluation, combining quantitative and quali-\ntative methods, offers valuable insights into a critical con-\ntemporary policy area. It reminds policy makers and\nimplementers that acquiring a technology is the start of the\nprocess, not the end. Technical systems are never perfect, and\nthey will require time and effort to become embedded into any\nparticular clinical context. It is notable that most of the\nsuccessful computerised prescribing systems in hospitals are\nsystems developed \u2018\u2018in-house\u2019\u2019, a situation in which the\nrelationship between the technology and the users has the\ngreatest potential for mutually beneficial interaction.5 6\nMore fundamentally, this study reminds us that, unlike a\nmedicine which has relatively fixed properties, the effectiveness\nof ICT changes and develops over time, and may have quite\ndifferent effects in different settings. For this reason a\nsophisticated evaluation framework, such as the one we have\nused, is necessary. At a time when there is unprecedented\nplanned expansion of ICT as a method of collecting information\nand reducing error, it is important that these properties of ICT\nare recognised and evaluations take them into account.\nAuthors\u2019 affiliations\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nNick Barber, The School of Pharmacy, London, UK\nTony Cornford, Ela Klecun, London School of Economics and Political\nScience, London, UK\nCompeting interests: The research was funded by MDG Medical and the\nDepartment of Health\u2019s Patient Safety Research Programme\u2014project\nPS019 (the full project report is available at http:\/\/www.pcpoh.bham.a-\nc.uk\/publichealth\/psrp\/publications.htm).
