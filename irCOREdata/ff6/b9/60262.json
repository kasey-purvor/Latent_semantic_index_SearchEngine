INTRODUCTION 1 \n 2 \nAnalysis of uncertainty in environmental risk assessments is becoming increasingly important  3 \n(e.g. Verdonck et al., 2005). To our knowledge, however, modelling approaches have not yet 4 \nbeen developed for the assessment of uncertainty in contaminant uptake and risk in wading 5 \nbirds. Here we present a probabilistic modelling approach for risk assessment that employs 6 \necologically relevant toxicological endpoints and, crucially, data inputs (bird behaviour, 7 \nmetal content of prey items, toxicity endpoints) that are realistic for typical environmental 8 \nimpact assessments.  The Monte-Carlo based model is used to assess the degree of risk posed 9 \nto birds from important estuarine habitats, and to show the limitations of such risk 10 \nassessments, particularly with regard to data availability. 11 \n  12 \nEstuaries are typically important feeding areas for wading birds but are also often subject to 13 \nhistoric and current chemical contamination by heavy metals.  Estuarine sediments 14 \ncommonly form major sinks for contaminants released during industrial activity. Many 15 \nindustrial processes lead to the release of metals initially in solution, which can then be 16 \nadsorbed on to, for example, Fe hydroxides or clay minerals (Pirrie et al., 2003) and are 17 \nsubsequently deposited onto estuarine sediments. Both past mining activity and present 18 \nindustrial discharges have resulted in the accumulation of metals in estuarine sediment. 19 \n 20 \nThe Severn Estuary\/Bristol Channel and Poole Harbour (Figure 1) are two major UK 21 \nestuaries and are classified as Special Protection Areas (SPAs) under the European Wild 22 \nBirds Directive.  During the winter, they support nationally and internationally important 23 \nnumbers of overwintering shorebirds (Pickess and Underhill-Day, 2002; Pollitt et al., 2003). 24 \nHowever, both areas are typical of estuaries in that they have previously been subject to 25 \nsignificant metal contamination.  Much of the metal contamination has been adsorbed onto 26 \n4 \n \nestuarine sediments and as a consequence concentrations of heavy metals in sediments 27 \nusually exceed those of the overlying water by between three and five orders of magnitude. 28 \nWith such high concentrations, the bioavailability of even a small fraction of the total 29 \nsediment metal can lead to uptake by filter-feeding and burrowing organisms (Bryan and 30 \nLangston, 1992). Furthermore, several metals, including mercury and lead, may be 31 \ntransformed in sediments to organometallic compounds which have greater bioavailability. 32 \nThese factors can result in accumulation of heavy metals by wading birds feeding in these 33 \nareas (Bryan and Langston, 1992; Ferns and Anderson, 1997). Although there is evidence 34 \nthat metal contamination is declining in both Poole Harbour (Langston, 2003a) and the 35 \nSevern Estuary (Duquesne et al., 2006; Langston et al., 2003b), the current levels of 36 \ncontamination suggest that they could still potentially have an impact on wildlife.   37 \n 38 \nAssessment of the potential risk to wading birds posed from contamination has rarely been 39 \ncarried out, except where there have been specific spills or industrial incidents (Bull et al., 40 \n1983); (Pain et al., 1998).  The aim of the current paper is to use the Severn Estuary and 41 \nPoole Harbour as model systems (for which relatively good empirical data are available) to 42 \nassess the potential risk posed to wading birds from long-term metal contamination in 43 \nestuaries. A Monte Carlo analysis will be carried out to estimate the probability that the 44 \nwading bird population is over-exposed to Pb and Hg in the two estuaries. 45 \n 46 \nMETHODS 47 \n 48 \nThe variability in population-averaged risk to dunlin, Calidris alpine, was assessed using a 49 \nscenario approach.  This species was selected because data on its diet selection and habitat 50 \nuse are available for both estuaries. Modelling was carried out in both estuaries for two 51 \n5 \n \nscenarios: the \u201eAverage\u201f Scenario and the \u201eWorst Case\u201f scenario. The \u201eAverage\u201f Scenario 52 \nrepresents the best estimate and range of possible PPC\/PNEC (predicted prey 53 \nconcentration\/predicted no effect concentration in prey) values for the average bird, which is 54 \nassumed (over a season) to have a dietary intake of contaminants equal to the mean 55 \nconcentration in prey across all the sites studied. The \u201eWorst Case\u201f scenario assumes a 56 \njuvenile bird (which has a lower ratio of body weight to food intake rate and hence a higher 57 \nPPC\/PNEC) feeding exclusively at the most contaminated site in each estuary. 58 \n 59 \nFor each of these scenarios, the uncertainty in predicted PPC\/PNEC value was determined by 60 \nMonte Carlo analysis after assigning uncertainties to each model input parameter based on 61 \nevaluation of empirical data. 62 \n 63 \nSelection of contaminants to be modelled 64 \nAn initial screening exercise was carried out to determine which contaminants to focus on in 65 \nsubsequent modelling. This was carried out by calculating the Predicted Environmental 66 \nConcentration (PEC) and the Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC) in birds for each 67 \ncontaminant. The PEC in this case was the predicted concentration of the contaminant in the 68 \nprey of the birds and is in this paper termed the PPC.  The ratio of the PPC to the PNEC was 69 \ncalculated as:  70 \n  71 \nPNEC\nPPC\n         (1) 72 \n 73 \nwhere values of this ratio above 1 imply a toxic risk. A key prey item, ragworms (Nereis 74 \ndiversicolor), were sampled from 12 sites in Poole Harbour and 13 sites in the Severn Estuary 75 \n(Environment Agency, unpubl. res.). It was assumed (for the purposes of the initial screening 76 \n6 \n \nexercise only) that contaminant concentrations in Nereis diversicolor were representative of 77 \nthose in the range of different prey items in each estuary, though in the full uncertainty 78 \nanalysis below, other prey types (earthworms, molluscs and crustaceans) were also 79 \nconsidered. Estimates of PPC\/PNEC were made for each of the organic and inorganic 80 \ncontaminants measured in Nereis. The results of this screening exercise are presented in the 81 \nSupplementary Material (Tables S1 and S2). Seven compounds (all metals or semi-metals) 82 \nhad maximum PPC\/PNEC ratios \u2265 1: zinc (Zn), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), selenium (Se), iron 83 \n(Fe), arsenic (As), and chromium (Cr) for at least one of the sites.  Fe was not determined in 84 \nthe Severn Estuary and Se was not determined in Poole Harbour. The source toxicity data 85 \nused in calculating the screening PPC\/PNEC ratios were then examined in detail to determine 86 \nif they were experimentally sound (if they fulfilled the criteria set out in the Toxicity Data 87 \nSection below) and if the endpoints were ecologically relevant. Using these criteria, only Pb 88 \nand Hg were selected for subsequent detailed modelling.  89 \n 90 \nModel input data 91 \n 92 \nBird distribution and diet 93 \nBird habitat use and feeding behaviour were estimated using a combination of a foraging 94 \nmodel which accounts for the different utilisation of feeding sites within an estuary (Stillman 95 \net al., 2005; Durell et al., 2006), the Wetland Bird Survey (WeBS) data and other literature 96 \ndata (Goss-Custard et al., 1988; Worrall, 1984). The proportion of different prey types taken 97 \nby the birds and their associated uncertainty estimates are shown in Table 1. Earthworms 98 \ncomprise a significant part of the diet for some shorebird species, but in these estuaries dunlin 99 \ndo not consume significant proportions of earthworms in their diet.  In Poole Harbour, dunlin 100 \nhave not been observed to eat earthworms (Durell et al., 2006), the major proportion of the 101 \n7 \n \ndiet of adult dunlin being marine worms, the rest being made up of molluscs and crustaceans. 102 \nIn the Severn Estuary, earthworms are estimated to form less than 10% of their diet. Juvenile 103 \ndunlin (Table 1) take similar food types to adults.  104 \n 105 \nDietary lead and mercury concentrations 106 \nThe data on Pb and Hg concentrations in Nereis diversicolor used in our model comprised 107 \nnot only new measurements (Environment Agency, unpubl. res.)) but also data from reviews 108 \nof contamination in Poole Harbour and the Severn Estuary (Langston et al., 2003b), 109 \nSupplementary Material,  Tables S3-S6). Assumed ranges and estimates of uncertainty in 110 \nmetal concentrations used in the model are summarised in Table 2. For prey items other than 111 \nNereis, uncertainties in metal concentrations were estimated from data in the reviews, taking 112 \naccount of the known decline in metal contamination over time. 113 \n 114 \nFor the worst-case scenario, it was assumed that the mean concentration of Pb and Hg in 115 \nNereis was equal to the highest value measured at any of the sites in each harbour with 116 \nuncertainty being normally distributed with coefficient of variation of 25%. Based on the 117 \nreview of data in Tables S3 \u2013 S6, for molluscs and crustaceans it was assumed (for the worst 118 \ncase scenario) that the average concentration at the most contaminated site was 3-10 times 119 \nhigher (Pb, Hg - Poole Harbour; Pb - Severn Estuary) or 1-3 times higher (Hg - Severn 120 \nEstuary) than the maximum measured value in Nereis.  121 \n 122 \nMetal concentrations in earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris) 123 \nDunlin in Poole Harbour do not consume earthworms (Durell et al., 2006) and we assumed 124 \nthat this was also true for most dunlin in the Severn Estuary (Table 1). Data on Pb 125 \nconcentrations in earthworms is limited but a study of the Avonmouth smelter found 126 \n8 \n \nconcentrations in worms at an unaffected site distant from the smelter to be 27 mg kg\n-1\n (dw) 127 \n(Spurgeon, 1994).  Concentrations in worms on a control site from a separate study were 4 \u2013 128 \n12.3 mg kg\n-1\n dw (Morgan and Morgan, 1991).   129 \nConcentrations of Hg in earthworms measured by (Bull et al., 1977) at a site uninfluenced by 130 \nindustrial activity (range 0.031-0.048 mg kg\n-1\n dw, n = 18) were generally lower than those 131 \nmeasured in estuarine biota (see Tables S4 and S6).  This suggests that, in contrast to Pb, Hg 132 \nin earthworms may have little effect on Hg intake in shorebirds. 133 \n 134 \nProportion of dietary mercury as methylmercury 135 \nThe NOAEL of methylmercury (MeHg) is approximately two orders of magnitude lower than 136 \nthat for inorganic Hg. It is therefore important to estimate the proportion of total Hg in prey 137 \nitems which is in the form of MeHg.  Muhaya et al. (1997) determined that the mean 138 \nproportion of Hg as MeHg in Nereis across 13 sites in the Netherlands was approximately 139 \n18%, but the distribution of values was highly skewed.  We therefore log-transformed these 140 \ndata (mean (\u00b1SD) log transformed proportion: 1.28 \u00b1 0.22) and used this transformed 141 \ndistribution to generate random values for our Monte-Carlo model. The values were then 142 \nback-transformed for use in the model. 143 \n 144 \nToxicity data  145 \nA literature search was conducted to identify studies from which avian NOAELs could be 146 \nderived for inorganic and organic Pb and Hg.  We used Web of Knowledge (ISI, 2005), 147 \nEnvironmental Health Criteria (World Health Organisation, 1989a; World Health 148 \nOrganisation, 1989b; World Health Organisation, 1990; World Health Organisation, 1991), 149 \nUS EPA ECOTOXicology database (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2002), and a 150 \nnumber of US EPA reports (Sample et al., 1997; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 151 \n9 \n \n1999; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2005) as reference sources.  Where possible, 152 \nthe original papers or reports were assessed, and three criteria were used to decide whether the 153 \nNOAEL values could be included in our models.  These were:   154 \n(i) effects on reproduction and growth are more likely to affect population densities than 155 \nlower order effects and in some cases are the integrated response to a range of physiological 156 \nand biochemical effects.  Thus, NOAELs based on reproduction and growth end-points were 157 \nincluded but those based on physiological, metabolic, biochemical and other lower level end-158 \npoints were rejected.  This selection procedure also increased the likelihood of finding 159 \nsufficient toxicity data for our model as there were unlikely to be multiple studies that used 160 \nexactly the same physiological and biochemical endpoints.  161 \n(ii) use of only one NOAEL from a study when multiple NOAELs were derived from the 162 \nsame test, thereby avoiding pseudo-replication (when multiple NOAELs were derived in the 163 \nsame study  but from different tests, all values were included). 164 \n(iii) studies in which the highest exposure level was assumed to be the NOAEL were excluded 165 \nbecause no effects were observed at any exposure level.   166 \n 167 \nThe value of a NOAEL and Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Levels (LOAELs) is partly 168 \ndetermined by the experimental design of the study if, in the case of NOAELs,  no effect is 169 \nobserved at the highest dose administered  or, in the case of LOAELs, an effect is observed at 170 \nthe lowest dose administered. Using NOAELs derived in such studies may give an over-171 \nestimate of the toxicity of a contaminant while using LOAELs may under-estimate the 172 \ntoxicity. NOAELs were used in this study as a precautionary approach in assessing risk to 173 \nwading birds. Even the studies reporting NOAELs for the effects of Pb and Hg on 174 \nreproduction and growth are sparse in number. Therefore, we also included studies which 175 \nreported chronic Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Levels (LOAELs) for appropriate end-176 \n10 \n \npoints and also investigated the use of LD50 values.  Chronic LOAELs were divided by 10 177 \nand LD50s were divided by 100  to approximate them to chronic NOAELs, following 178 \n(USACHPPM, 2000). 179 \n 180 \nThe ranges in NOAEL used in our models are summarised in Table 3, and the individual data 181 \nare presented in Table S7 in the Supplementary Material: this table also gives information on 182 \nthe species on which the tests were conducted.  For Pb, we found only four studies that met 183 \nour selection criteria for NOAELs.  There are few avian lethality tests for inorganic Pb and, 184 \nfor those test that have been done, LC50 values typically exceed the highest experimental 185 \ndose (\u2265 5000 mg Pb\/kg food).  Although we found two avian LD50 values for tetraethyl lead, 186 \nthere appear to be large differences in toxicity between tetraethyl Pb and Pb salts and so we 187 \ndid not use the data for tetraethyl Pb in our model.  For Hg, we found five values (two for 188 \ninorganic Hg, three for Me-Hg) of chronic NOAELs.  Seven further NOAELs (six for MeHg, 189 \none for inorganic Hg) were derived from LD50 values.  For MeHg, there are LD50 values for 190 \nHg for six species of bird (multiple values for most species). We calculated a geometric mean 191 \nLD50 for each species, then, divided these figures by 100 to convert them to chronic 192 \nNOAELs. The range of NOAELs derived in this way was 0.195 to 0.378 mg kg\n-1\n day\n-1\n, at 193 \nleast one order of magnitude higher than experimentally-derived chronic NOAELs for methyl 194 \nmercury dicyandiamide based on reproductive end-points. 195 \n 196 \nModelling 197 \nThe PPC\/PNEC approach was used for the more detailed modelling of Hg and Pb impacts. 198 \nThe PPC was predicted using: 199 \n 200 \ni\niiCfPPC      (2) 201 \n11 \n \n 202 \nwhere fi  is the fraction of the birds\u201f diet composed of prey item i and Ci is the concentration 203 \n(mg kg\n-1\n dw) of the metal in prey item i. 204 \n 205 \nThe PNEC was estimated using  206 \n 207 \nDW\/day) (kg FIR\n(kg)BW BW\/day) gNOAEL(mg\/k\nPNEC    (3) 208 \n 209 \nwhere NOAEL is the no observable adverse effect level, BW is the bird body weight and FIR 210 \nis the average daily food intake rate. PPC\/PNEC ratios are calculated on a dry weight basis. .  211 \n 212 \nA Monte-Carlo model was programmed in Microsoft Excel using, where appropriate, 213 \nMicrosoft Visual Basic macros. Using the available data, we ran the Monte-Carlo model to 214 \nestimate ranges in possible PPC\/PNEC values. A total of 10 000 random values were 215 \ngenerated for each variable.  These were based on a normal (or lognormal, as appropriate) 216 \ndistribution about a mean where data were available to determine the mean and uncertainty. 217 \nWhen there were insufficient data to estimate probability distributions, a uniform distribution 218 \nacross the range in observed parameter values was assumed. An additional step was 219 \nintroduced into the model for Hg which was to estimate the fraction of total Hg made up by 220 \nMeHg.  A model sensitivity analysis was carried out by first assigning to each of the input 221 \nparameters its mean value (c.f. Cox et al., 2006). Individual input parameters were then 222 \nassigned random values within their uncertainty distributions for 10 000 model runs to 223 \ndetermine the impact of uncertainty in each input parameter on the predicted PPC\/PNEC 224 \nvalue. 225 \n 226 \n12 \n \nThe daily food intake rate (FIR) was estimated using empirical relationships between food 227 \nintake rate and body weight (BW) (Nagy, 2001). For shorebirds, gulls and auks the daily food 228 \nintake (FIR; DW, kg d\n-1\n) is estimated by regression from data for 15 species in (Nagy, 2001) 229 \ngiving: 230 \n 231 \n77.0)BW(11.0FIR          (4) 232 \n 233 \n(n=15, R\n2\n=0.86, p < 0.001). The residuals in this model were approximately lognormally 234 \ndistributed with mean (of logged ratios model:measured) 0 and standard deviation (of logged 235 \nratios) 0.123. The regression equation and distribution of residuals was used to determine the 236 \nbest estimate and uncertainty in FIR for dunlin. 237 \n 238 \nResults  239 \n 240 \nThe model gives the probability distribution of estimated PPC\/PNEC values based on 10 000 241 \nmodel runs for each estuary and scenario. An example of the model output for Pb in Poole 242 \nHarbour (\u201eAverage\u201f Scenario) is shown in Figure 2, and for Hg in the Severn Estuary in 243 \nFigure 3. All of the model outputs were summarised as the median, 5\nth\n and 95\nth\n percentile 244 \nvalues of PPC\/PNEC in Poole Harbour and the Severn Estuary (Table 4).  245 \n 246 \nLead 247 \nFor the \u201eAverage\u201f Scenario, median PPC\/PNEC values for Pb were 2.0 and 6.5 for Poole 248 \nHarbour and the Severn Estuary respectively (Figure 4). The lowest 5 percentile value was 249 \nless than 1 in both estuaries, but the highest 95 percentile values were 22 and 75 in Poole 250 \nHarbour and the Severn Estuary respectively. For the \u201eWorst Case\u201f scenario, median 251 \n13 \n \nPPC\/PNEC values were only slightly higher than for the \u201eAverage\u201f Scenario; however, 95 252 \npercentile values were significantly higher, ranging up to 121. 253 \n 254 \nMercury 255 \nPPC\/PNEC estimates for both estuaries are shown in Figure 5. There were sufficient 256 \necotoxicological data to compare the PPC\/PNEC ratios for MeHg based either on 257 \nexperimentally-derived NOAELs or on the much higher approximated values calculated as 258 \nLD50\/100 (Table 3).   The predicted PPC\/PNEC ratios were much higher when based on 259 \nexperimentally derived NOAELs than when based on the LD50\/100 (Figure 5).  When the 260 \nPNEC was estimated using the LD50\/100, Hg would not be predicted to have any 261 \nenvironmental impact on birds in either estuary, since PPC\/PNEC values were lower than 1 262 \n(with a probability of > 95%). In contrast, there is a significant (i.e. >5%) probability that 263 \nPPC\/PNEC values for Hg based on the experimentally derived NOAEL are greater than 1 in 264 \nboth Poole Harbour and the Severn Estuary. Nevertheless, PPC\/PNEC values for Hg (18% 265 \nMeHg, based on NOAEL) are much lower than for Pb in Poole Harbour with the median 266 \nPPC\/PNEC being close to 1 for both \u201eAverage\u201f and \u201eWorst Case\u201f scenarios.  267 \n 268 \nSensitivity Analysis 269 \n 270 \nWe have evaluated the sensitivity of the model to uncertainty in different input parameters. 271 \nIllustrative results of different sensitivity analyses are discussed here.  272 \n 273 \nThere is a very large uncertainty in the NOAEL for Pb; this varies approximately uniformly 274 \nover a range spanning two orders of magnitude (Figure 6). As illustrated in Figure 6, this 275 \nuncertainty in NOAEL dominates the uncertainty in the PPC\/PNEC ratio for Pb when all 276 \n14 \n \nother parameters are assigned their mean value. The predicted PPC\/PNEC ratio, when only 277 \nNOAEL varies, spans a similar range to that predicted when all parameters are allowed to 278 \nvary. When the sensitivity analysis was carried out for other parameters (i.e. other individual 279 \nparameters varied whilst all other parameters assigned their mean) the variation in the 280 \npredicted PPC\/PNEC was minor (Figure 6). 281 \n 282 \nThe sensitivity analysis for Hg is illustrated in Figure 7. The PPC\/PNEC ratio for Hg is 283 \npredicted with significantly greater certainty than that for Pb with predicted PPC\/PNEC 284 \nvalues for Hg being within a range of approximately one order of magnitude. The percentage 285 \nof Hg in the form MeHg is the most important source of uncertainty in the predicted 286 \nPPC\/PNEC ratio, though uncertainty in Hg content of molluscs, FIR and NOAEL also 287 \ncontribute significantly to model uncertainty. 288 \n 289 \nThe outputs of the sensitivity analysis for different estuary scenarios showed very similar 290 \npatterns to the illustrative examples we have given for Pb and Hg in Figures 6 and 7 291 \nrespectively.  292 \n 293 \nDiscussion 294 \n 295 \nThis assessment of two estuaries showed a potential impact of Hg and Pb contamination on 296 \nshorebird communities. For the Average Scenario, there was estimated to be a greater than 297 \n50% probability that PEC\/PNEC values exceeded 1 for Pb in both estuaries and for Hg in the 298 \nSevern Estuary (Table 4). There was an approximately 40% probability that PEC\/PNEC 299 \nexceeded 1 for Hg in Poole Harbour. For the \u201cWorst Case\u201d scenario, probabilities of 300 \nPEC\/PNEC > 1 were 95% or greater for both metals in the Severn Estuary and 68 and 75% 301 \n15 \n \nfor Hg and Pb (respectively) in Poole Harbour. For Hg, where PNEC was calculated on the 302 \nbasis of LD50\/100, PEC\/PNEC values were not predicted to exceed 1 in either estuary (Table 303 \n4).  304 \n 305 \nThe study on two model estuaries for which relatively strong empirical data on shorebird 306 \n(dunlin) feeding habits and metal concentrations were available demonstrates that intakes of 307 \nthese metals in metal contaminated estuaries are at levels which may have adverse effects on 308 \necologically-relevant endpoints. This conclusion is based on an assessment of the food uptake 309 \npathway. We will, however, briefly consider the potential importance of other uptake 310 \npathways for these metals. 311 \n 312 \nAlternative Uptake Pathways 313 \n 314 \nBecause the water-prey bioaccumulation factor is high for these metals, the direct ingestion 315 \nof water by birds is a much less important uptake pathway than the food pathway we have 316 \nmodelled here. It therefore plays no significant role in predictions of PEC and uncertainty in 317 \nthose predictions (Crane et al., 2005).  318 \n 319 \nUptake by ingestion of contaminated soil or sediment may occur incidentally (as, for 320 \nexample, soil or sediment attached to food is ingested) or deliberately (some birds, for 321 \nexample, deliberately ingest grit). Ingestion of contaminated soil or sediment is likely to vary 322 \nsignificantly depending on the behaviour and diet of a bird. For different species of birds, the 323 \nUSEPA (USEPA, 1993) have estimated values of <2 % to 30% soil or sediment (per unit dry 324 \nweight) in faeces of different birds. The highest values were observed in sandpipers which 325 \nfeed on mud-dwelling invertebrates. 326 \n16 \n \n 327 \nUsing data for Pb and Hg in sediments in Poole Harbour (taken from the same sites as Nereis 328 \nwere sampled; Environment Agency, unpubl. res.), we have estimated the potential uptake 329 \nvia contaminated sediments in comparison with direct uptake from food. The calculation 330 \nassumed that either 2% of dry matter intake (DMI) is sediment, or 30% of DMI is sediment. 331 \nThis assumption is based on the USEPA (USEPA, 1993) study of sediment in faeces, though 332 \nthis is likely to be somewhat over-estimated since dry mass of excreted food is lower than dry 333 \nmass of ingested food. For Pb, the amount of ingested metal per day via sediment was in the 334 \nrange 0.01 \u2013 0.15 mg d-1 (for DMI in the range 2-30%) compared to 0.039 mg d-1 via food. 335 \nFor Hg, the ingestion rate via sediment was in the range 7.4 \u00d7 10\n-5\n to 1.1 \u00d7 10\n-3\n mg d\n-1\n 336 \ncompared to 1.6 \u00d7 10\n-3\n mg d\n-1\n via food.  It should be noted, however, that: (1) the upper range 337 \nof sediment ingestion rate of 30% may be unrealistically high: for sandpipers the range was 338 \nestimated to be in the range 7.3-30% (USEPA, 1993) and; (2) metals adsorbed to sediments 339 \nmay be less bioavailable than those in prey (Sheppard et al., 1995). It is, however, possible 340 \nthat direct ingestion of sediment could lead to higher PPC\/PNEC values than those 341 \ndetermined for the food pathway alone, although uncertainties in metal bioavailability and 342 \nsediment uptake make the role of the sediment pathway difficult to quantify.  343 \n 344 \n 345 \nUncertainty in Model Predictions 346 \nIt should be noted that model sensitivity analyses, by definition, only give information on the 347 \nuncertainty encompassed within the defined model. A sensitivity analysis does not 348 \nnecessarily encapsulate all sources of uncertainty (a limitation of all environmental and 349 \necological models). It is possible that due to unknown factors (which may make model 350 \nparameters vary to a different extent than those assumed in the model) real PPC\/PNEC values 351 \n17 \n \nmay be different to the predicted ranges. For example, the NOAEL values used for this study 352 \nare necessarily estimated from data on laboratory birds of different species than those studied 353 \nhere. Actual NOAELs of the wild species studied here may be significantly different to those 354 \nused in the model. Thus sensitivity analysis (whilst being a powerful modelling tool) cannot 355 \nalone determine predictive uncertainty of environmental models.  356 \n 357 \nReducing uncertainty 358 \nFurther field studies of metal concentrations in prey and (to the extent which it is possible) 359 \nfield assessments of the impact of metals on bird health\/populations would be required to 360 \nfurther reduce model uncertainty and to improve assessment of that uncertainty (i.e. validate 361 \npredictions). For Pb, as shown above, the uncertainty in NOAEL is the dominant factor in 362 \nmodel sensitivity, so reducing this uncertainty will have a much greater impact than reducing 363 \nuncertainty in other parameters. For Hg, uncertainty in NOAEL is also important, but the 364 \nstudy has also identified uncertainty in Hg content of prey items, FIR, and relative presence 365 \nof MeHg as being important sources of uncertainty on which future research should be 366 \nfocussed. 367 \n  368 \nOverwintering birds 369 \n 370 \nIn the context of this modelling study, it is important to realise that, for waders that 371 \noverwinter in Poole Harbour or the Severn Estuary and migrate to breeding grounds 372 \nelsewhere, exposure to metal contaminants at the time of breeding may be quite different to 373 \nthat experienced during the winter. It is uncertain what, if any, impacts previous overwinter 374 \nexposure(s) to Pb or Hg may have on subsequent breeding success. Some of the contaminants 375 \naccumulated over winter may be remobilised. For example, Pb sequestered in bone may be 376 \n18 \n \nremobilised as bone (and calcium) turnover increases during egg production, or MeHg in fat 377 \nmay be remobilised as energy reserves are depleted during migration, immediately before 378 \nbreeding starts. There are no toxicological studies that we are aware of that specifically 379 \ninvestigate the effects of prior exposures to Pb and Hg on subsequent reproduction; exposure 380 \ntypically occurs prior to and\/or during the reproductive cycle. Pharmaco-kinetic modelling 381 \nwould therefore be needed to estimate the likely extent of remobilisation of previously 382 \naccumulated contaminants and how this might supplement the internal dose derived from 383 \ndietary intake on the breeding grounds 384 \n 385 \nThe other principal way in which metal intake on overwintering grounds could have 386 \necologically significant effects is their potential contribution to direct over-winter mortality 387 \nor decrease in likelihood of survival during spring migration. There are no suitable toxicity 388 \ntest endpoints to assess whether survival during migration could be affected.  Thus, the only 389 \navailable data are for acute toxicity data (LD50\/LC50\/NOAEL data), which are also sparse for 390 \ninorganic Pb and Hg in birds.  We did not attempt to use acute toxicity endpoints in most of 391 \nthe probabilistic models but had sufficient ecotoxicological data for methyl-mercury to carry 392 \nout an assessment using a NOAEL for survival. This was derived by dividing the LD50 data 393 \nby 100.  When this endpoint was used, the modelled median PPC\/PNEC ratios were all 394 \nextremely low, the 95\nth\n percentile for the worst case scenario being 0.5. Thus, from this 395 \nlimited assessment, there is no evidence that overwinter dietary intake of Pb or Hg poses an 396 \nacute toxic threat to dunlin on the Severn Estuary or Poole Harbour.  397 \n 398 \n 399 \n 400 \n 401 \n19 \n \nConclusions 402 \n 403 \nThe Monte-Carlo based model presented here is able to assess the degree of risk posed to 404 \nbirds feeding on important estuarine habitats, and also shows the limitations of such risk 405 \nassessments, particularly with regard to data quality and availability. This modelling study 406 \nindicates that internationally important feeding grounds for waders such as Poole Harbour 407 \nand the Severn Estuary may pose an ecologically-relevant toxic risk to wading birds. It was 408 \nfound that there was a high probability that PPC\/PNEC for Pb significantly exceeded 1 in 409 \nboth areas for dunlin.  There was also a high probability that PPC\/PNEC for Hg significantly 410 \nexceeded 1 in the Severn Estuary and a significant (>5%) probability that PPC\/PNEC 411 \nexceeded 1 in Poole Harbour.  412 \n 413 \nThe model largely used data sets which would be typically available and necessary for 414 \nassessing the impacts of contamination of large estuaries, although data describing feeding 415 \npreferences and foraging patterns for waders are rarely site-specific.  Whilst acknowledging 416 \nthe inevitable limitations in using such data sets (which are made up of data from a number of 417 \nsources), their use gives a realistic estimate of uncertainty in environmental impact 418 \nassessments. Such an uncertainty based assessment gives important insights into the 419 \nlimitations of real environmental impact assessments. 420 \n 421 \nDespite much previous work on its ecotoxicological impacts, a major source of uncertainty in 422 \npredicting PPC\/PNEC values for Pb was the large uncertainty in NOAEL values.  Generation 423 \nof further experimental toxicity data for metals in birds is likely to be extremely limited 424 \nbecause of the ethical concerns associated with such work, and it is doubtful that there will be 425 \nsignificant reduction in the future in the uncertainty associated with these measures.  For Hg, 426 \n20 \n \nthe amount of Hg present as MeHg, FIR and prey metal concentrations were also important 427 \nsources of uncertainty and further studies to improve the precision of measurements of these 428 \nparameters would reduce some of the uncertainty when estimating the risks of Hg to wading 429 \nbirds.  430 \n 431 \nUse of lethal toxicity data (LD50\/100) was investigated as a method for assessing sub-lethal 432 \nimpacts from Hg. It was found that this method led to a significant under-estimate of the 433 \npotential impact of Hg contamination, as compared with direct estimation of NOAEL. 434 \n 435 \nIf significant toxic risk is still predicted following appropriate studies to reduce the 436 \nuncertainty associated with contaminant levels in prey species, field studies to assess 437 \ncontaminant residues and relevant health indices in waterbirds should be undertaken. These 438 \nshould be focussed on high risk sites where inputs of relevant contaminants are ongoing. An 439 \napproach which makes use of waterbird carcasses (found dead at relevant sites), similar to the 440 \nUK\u201fs Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme, should be considered,  to provide further insight 441 \ninto the significance of the risk predictions made through the modelling work reported here.  442 \nApplication of non-invasive biomarkers to samples which could potentially be collected 443 \nduring routine ringing operations may provide useful supplementary information.  444 \n 445 \n 446 \n 447 \n 448 \n 449 \n 450 \n 451 \n21 \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 452 \n 453 \nThe authors would like to thank the Steering Group for this project, namely Jennifer Best 454 \n(Natural England), Peter Jonas (Environment Agency) and Chris Nikitik (Environment 455 \nAgency Wales).
