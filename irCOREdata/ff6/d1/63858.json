Of particular concern have been the chlorinated hydrocarbons \n(CHCs) reflecting both their frequent and widespread occurrence in groundwater (Rivett et al. \n1990a; NRC 1994; Moran and Davis 1998), and their physicochemical characteristics which \nmake them especially troublesome contaminants in the subsurface. These characteristics \ninclude: low aqueous solubility with the potential to remain in the non-aqueous phase, \npersistence of some of the more highly chlorinated compounds under normal subsurface \nconditions, weak sorption by common aquifer materials and low permitted drinking water \nguidelines (Aurand et al. 1981; Mercer and Cohen 1990; WHO 1998). \nThe liquid chlorinated solvents are commonly denser than water (an exception being \nvinyl chloride) and are often classed as dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs).  \nDNAPLs can sink through an aquifer and accumulate on poorly-permeable horizons, slowly \ndissolving in groundwater to produce dissolved-phase plumes, which may adversely affect \ndownstream users of groundwater.  In fractured aquifers, DNAPL migration may be both \nrapid and localised, controlled largely by fracture aperture, interconnectivity and orientation. \nAccurate prediction of DNAPL movement in fractured rocks is likely to prove costly and be \ndifficult, if not impossible to achieve (e.g., Toussaint and Weyer 1992a, 1992b; Sudicky et al. \n1998). \nThe Triassic Sherwood Sandstone, which is the most important aquifer in northern \nEngland and the west Midlands (Fig. 1), underlies areas with a long history of heavy industry, \nchemical manufacture and metal processing.  As a consequence of historical spillages around \nspecific sources, contamination of the sandstone aquifer by CHCs is known to be both locally \nsignificant and widespread under some urban centres (Rivett et al. 1990b; Lawrence et al. \n 4\n1992; Burston et al. 1993; Hooker et al. 1999) and others are assessed as being at risk (Tait et \nal. 2003).  \nThe sandstone commonly has a deep unsaturated zone frequently 10-30 m thick but \nwhich can be in excess of 50 m (Allen et al. 1997).  Water movement in the unsaturated zone \ncan be complex, with ponding on less permeable layers, potentially giving rise to perched \nwater tables and lateral flow above less permeable layers, particularly where recharge is high. \nAssessment of the risk posed to the environment and to long-term groundwater users \nby a contaminated site, particularly where DNAPLs may have been used, often requires \ncharacterisation of contaminant distribution close to the source.  Core drilling and detailed \nporewater sampling in conjunction with evaluation of aquifer characteristics and \nheterogeneity can help to provide an understanding of contaminant processes and assessment \nof whether DNAPL was, or is, present.  Such investigations are costly and can potentially \nexacerbate the situation by cross-contamination.  Therefore invasive techniques (e.g. drilling) \nneed to be optimised and the amount of information extracted from any borehole maximised. \nThe purpose of this paper is to discuss contaminant migration behaviour in the \nunsaturated zone of the Sherwood Sandstone aquifer and to consider the requirements for \nsuccessful investigation methodologies.  A case study is presented which shows that selecting \nan appropriate density of sampling is crucial both to providing an understanding of \ncontaminant pathways and distinguishing whether CHCs are present predominantly in the \naqueous or non-aqueous phase. \n \nHydrogeology of the Sherwood Sandstone Group \nThe Permo-Triassic sandstones of the UK, of which the Sherwood Sandstone Group \nconstitutes a major part (Table 1), form the second-most important aquifer after the Chalk, in \n 5\nterms of quantities of water abstracted but are the most important in terms of volumes of \ngroundwater stored (Allen et al. 1997). \nThe Sherwood Sandstone Group is largely of fluviatile origin, deposited by a braided \nriver system, but locally aeolian deposits also occur. The total thickness of the sequence can \nbe up to several hundreds of metres.  The predominant lithology is sandstone, although some \nconglomerates, siltstones and mudstones are usually present (Allen et al. 1997). Fining-\nupwards cycles are common in the fluvial deposits of the upper part of the sandstones. Each \ncycle may vary from one to several metres thick; the basal member of the cycle is usually \nrepresented by a coarse sandstone or conglomerate which progressively fines upwards to a \nfine-grained sandstone, siltstone or mudstone. The aeolian sandstones tend to be more \nhomogeneous, both laterally and vertically. \nInterbedded sandstone-mudstone successions can be considered as falling into three \nmain types, depending on geometry of the sandstones, the ratio of sandstone to mudstone \npresent in the succession, the interconnectivity of the sandstones and the lateral continuity of \nthe mudstones. In decreasing order of connectivity of sandstones (increasing amounts of \nmudstone) these types are: \n\u2022 Layer-cake \n\u2022 Jigsaw \n\u2022 Labyrinth (not considered further since it is not normally present in the Sherwood \nSandstone) \nThe characteristics of the layer cake and jigsaw types in cross-section are illustrated in Fig. 2. \nThe importance of these characteristics is that they can be used as models to aid prediction of \npotential fluid flow through the succession. For example, the layer-cake architecture has \nlaterally continuous mudstone beds that may restrict vertical migration of fluids; any fluid \nflow will be parallel to the bedding. Conversely, mudstones within the jigsaw architectural \n 6\nmodel are discontinuous and do not form barriers to fluid flow, although they can locally \nform baffles. Fluid flow within this type of succession can be orthogonal to bedding.  \nThe upper part of the Sherwood Sandstone consists of mainly jigsaw architecture. In \nthe Helsby Sandstone (Table 1), sheet and lenticular channel sandbodies interbedded with \nlaterally discontinuous mudstone beds form the majority of the succession. Major mudstone \nprone intervals within these may have layer cake architecture. The underlying Wilmslow \nSandstone is aeolian and also has jigsaw architecture although mudstones are less \ncommon\u2026\u2026..more editing needed. \nAquifer transmissivities for the sandstones range from 1 to 5000 m2\/d (median \n189 m2\/d) and well yields of 5,000 m3\/d are not uncommon (Allen et al. 1997).  These yields \nreflect both the moderate to high hydraulic conductivity of the sandstones and the \nconsiderable thickness of the aquifer.  For the sandstones hydraulic conductivities can be up \nto 15 m\/d but are much lower for the finer-grained or more-cemented lithologies. The \npermeability of the mudstone horizons cannot be measured in the laboratory since a coherent \nplug cannot be cut, but it is assumed to be several orders of magnitude less than the \nsandstones. The sandstones possess primary porosities of 15-35%, which provide \nconsiderable volumes of groundwater storage.  Dominant pore throat sizes vary from 0.1 to \n100 \u00b5m so that within the unsaturated zone the larger pores are likely to be drained (and thus \nairfilled) whilst the smaller pores will retain their water (Price 1977; Allen et al. 1997; \nBloomfield et al. 2001). \nThe sandstones are also cut by fractures; the spacing between fractures is variable but \nis often relatively infrequent, on a scale of metres, particularly for vertical fractures (Allen et \nal. 1998). The contribution of these fractures overall to aquifer transmissivity is less clear.  \nCertainly investigations have shown that the fracture flow can be the predominant contributor \nto the groundwater inflow into individual boreholes (Walthall and Ingram 1981; Price et al. \n 7\n1982). However other studies have shown that for regional flow it is flow through the matrix \nthat dominates (Walthall and Campbell 1986; Allen et al. 1997).  These apparently \ncontradictory observations are usually explained by assuming that the fracturing is largely \nlocalised and possibly associated with sand-infill being washed into major abstraction \nboreholes (Price, 2003). As a consequence regional flow is controlled by the matrix \npermeability. \n \nContaminant Migration and Controls in the Unsaturated Zone \nAt contaminated sites the CHCs may be present both as DNAPL and aqueous phase. For the \nassessment of fate and transport it is necessary to be able to distinguish between these phases, \nsince the aqueous phase will migrate with regional groundwater flow whereas DNAPL \nmigration at the local scale is typically controlled by preferential pathways such as fractures \nand large diameter interconnected pores. \nThe chlorinated solvents, in the non-aqueous phase are non-wetting fluids with \nrespect to water and, in a water-wet porous medium, will be confined to the larger openings \n(Keuper et al. 1989).  Lawrence et al. (1992) estimated the likely excess pressure required for \ntetrachloroethene (perchloroethylene, PCE) to invade (displace water from) saturated Permo-\nTriassic sandstones for a range of apertures. This suggested that excess heads of only a few \ntens of centimetres of DNAPL would be required to displace water from the large pore \napertures (10 \u2013 50 \u00b5m) or several meters for the smaller pore apertures (1 \u2013 10 \u00b5m). More \nrecent research (Gooddy et al. 2002) suggests that for industrial-grade PCE, the contact angle \nin water\u2013sandstone systems is higher than previously reported. As a consequence, the excess \npressure required for such PCE to displace water from sandstone is lower, and excess heads \nof less than 10 cm may be sufficient to displace water from pores of 1 \u00b5m aperture.    \n 8\nTwo questions arise when considering DNAPL movement through the unsaturated zone \nof the Permo-Triassic aquifer: is DNAPL movement predominantly through fractures or the \nmatrix and how do the various lithologies influence DNAPL movement?   Based on the \ncharacteristics of the fracturing in the Permo-Triassic Sandstones in the vicinity of the study \narea (Table 1), migration through the matrix is thought to be predominant because: \n\u2022 the major vertical or sub-vertical fracture spacing is large (10-20 m); in consequence the \ncontaminant would be in contact with a much greater area of matrix than fracture since \ntypically the ratio of matrix to fracture porosity is greater than 50:1 (the fracture porosity \nis likely to be as low as 0.1-0.5% and the matrix porosity to exceed 25%); \n\u2022 the majority of vertical or sub-vertical fractures are thought to be sediment filled which \nconsiderably reduces the permeability contrast with the matrix;  \n\u2022 many vertical or sub-vertical fractures are discontinuous and are restricted to individual \nbeds and are therefore less than 2 m in length. \nIn addition, within the unsaturated zone of the sandstones, the larger pores (and fractures) \nwill have been drained and DNAPL will migrate preferentially through these air-filled voids. \nMoisture content measurements on core obtained during drilling indicate that about 30% of \nthe pores are air-filled. \nThe siltstone and mudstone layers in the upper part of the Sherwood Sandstone will \nbe mostly water-saturated because of their much smaller pore neck size. As a consequence, \nthese finer lithologies will act as barriers to downward movement of DNAPL (Keller et al, \n2000). However in fluvial sandstones with typical jigsaw architecture, downward movement \nof DNAPL may be possible because the DNAPL can flow around the \u2018barrier\u2019 (remove Fig. \n3). Nevertheless some lateral movement can be anticipated. In sandstones with layer-cake \narchitecture, downward movement of DNAPL is more problematic and significant lateral \n 9\nspreading is probable, although downward migration may be possible where vertical fractures \ncut through the less permeable mudstone layers (Reynolds and Keuper, 2004).  \nOnce the main body of DNAPL has passed through the rock some will remain \ninfilling some of the pores and fracture spaces.  This retained DNAPL is usually referred to \nas residual.  In granular aquifers, residual can occupy more than 30% of the total pore volume \n(Hunt et al. 1988), which corresponds to about 5-10% of the rock volume in the case of the \nSherwood sandstone.  However, in fractured bedrock aquifers the residual will occupy a \nmuch smaller fraction of the rock volume (Mackay and Cherry 1989).  This residual remains \nheterogeneously distributed within the unsaturated zone in response to its structure following \nthe downward passage of the main DNAPL body (Poulsen and Keuper, 1992) and acts as a \nsecondary or subsurface \u2018DNAPL source\u2019 of the contaminant (Lawrence et al. 1992).  The \nmass of residual DNAPL will be reduced by processes of dissolution, diffusion, advection \nand volatilisation. Degradation of some CHCs, particularly PCE, TCE and their daughter \nproducts, can be negligible, particularly in aerobic environments such as the unsaturated \nzone.  These processes are slow and residual is likely to remain in the unsaturated zone for \nyears or decades (Parker et al. 1994; Abriola and Bradford 1998,). \nDissolution of residual by subsequent infiltration will produce a dissolved phase \nplume within the unsaturated zone. This plume will itself be attenuated by diffusion into the \nmatrix. Back diffusion from the rock to the fractures may occur over a very long period of \ntime (Lipson et al, 2005). Water movement in the unsaturated sandstones is likely to be \ncomplex given the wide range of lithotypes and their geometries. Under high hydraulic \nsurcharging water is likely to follow a similar pathway to DNAPL, spreading laterally across \nless permeable layers, due to the limited water infiltration capacity of these layers. \n 10\nData Requirements for Evaluating Contaminant Distribution \nEvaluating contaminant distribution within the unsaturated zone presents special difficulties, \nin part because of the difficulty and cost of obtaining water samples.  However core drilling \nand analysis of fluids present in the rock can provide an insight into the contaminant \ndistribution (Lawrence et al. 1990).  Further, where this understanding is combined with \ninformation on geological heterogeneity and fracturing, the likely pathways through the \nunsaturated zone may be inferred. \nIn this respect the issue of sample density and data aggregation is of crucial \nimportance and this has been well established for numbers and spatial distribution of \nsampling points (e.g. Grabow et al 1993; Vucetic and Obradovic, 2000). Where funds are \nlimited, a balanced approach must be taken between too few and too many samples.  \nSampling at too coarse a scale will limit costs but may result in missing important data and \nthe drawing of erroneous conclusions.  Very large numbers of samples will increase the cost \nof the investigation both in terms of analytical cost and in sample selection and preparation. \nThe latter may limit drilling progress significantly where large numbers of samples are \ninvolved because it is advisable to analyse for DNAPL-forming contaminants on-site. The \nresults are needed to guide drilling progress in order to avoid possible cross contamination \nproblems, such as DNAPL migration to a lower uncontaminated stratum using the new \npathway provided by the open borehole. \nIt is suggested that a sensible guideline should be that a sampling frequency that \ncorresponds to the scale of lithological heterogeneity should be used.  For example if \nlithological changes are occurring over 0.1 m intervals then sampling intervals should be of a \nsimilar order. If there is no a priori knowledge of the scale of lithological heterogeneity at the \nsite then it may be hard to determine the correct scale at which to sample. Under such \n 11\ncircumstances it may be necessary to drill an exploratory lithological borehole in a nearby \nuncontaminated location to gain the required information. \nWhere contaminant transport by vertical fractures may be important, angled or \ninclined boreholes are likely to be more effective. This is because vertical boreholes are \nunlikely to intercept these fractures especially where the fracture spacing is typically of the \norder of metres. \n \nThe Study Site \nSite Description \nThe study site was an old, disused sandstone quarry located on the Runcorn Peninsula, \nCheshire. The quarry was about 35 m deep and had been used to dispose of contaminated \nlime slurries during the period 1935 \u2013 1951 (ENDS 2000). The contaminants included \nchlorinated hydrocarbons which were likely to have been present in both the dissolved and \nnon-aqueous phases. The main chlorinated hydrocarbons included trichloroethene (TCE) and \nPCE. Large volumes of supernatant liquid drained out of the quarry into the sandstone during \nthe period when the slurries were being disposed leaving behind a thick sludge.  Once the \nquarry was nearly filled with sludge it was covered with fly ash and grassed over. \nPermo-Triassic rocks of the upper part of the Sherwood Sandstone sequence, the \nHelsby and Wilmslow Sandstone Formations, underlie the site (Table 1), the former \ncomprising cemented fluvial channel succession deposits which were originally quarried for \nbuilding stone.  Local lithostratigraphic information for the Helsby Sandstone Formation, \nincluding the scale of vertical and lateral lithological variations as observed in the former \nquarry walls prior to infilling was provided by Hull (1882), Mainswell (1914 and 1915) and \nWray (1937). The lithologies exposed at the outcrop near to the site consist of soft to well-\nconsolidated sandstones with subordinate mudstones and flaggy sandstones.     \n 12\nMapping of the fractures in local road cuttings and an old tunnel beneath part of the \nsite showed that in this part of the sandstones major vertical fractures cutting across the \nbedding were widely spaced (10\u201320 m, Table 2).  These fractures tended to be about 5 mm \nacross and were usually filled with loose uncemented but compacted sediment (Wealthall et \nal, 2001).  Other smaller vertical and cross-bedding fractures tended to be of limited aperture \nand to be restricted to individual beds. Bedding plane fractures were also generally narrow \nbut may have been laterally extensive with the largest associated with pronounced \nlithological changes. \nThe unsaturated zone is up to 75 m thick with the water table about 35 m below the base of \nthe quarry. \n \nSite Investigation Methodology \nThe overall purpose of the site investigation was to provide data to enable an assessment of \nthe risk posed to the environment by the chemicals and slurries disposed in the quarry. The \napproach adopted was to obtain detailed pore-fluid concentration profiles of organic and \ninorganic components in the unsaturated zone.  The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate \nhow such detailed profiles can provide insight into contaminant migration and how the \nsampling frequency affects the interpretation.  Only data relevant to these aspects of the study \nare presented here. \nTwo cored boreholes were drilled adjacent to the quarry using a 100 mm-diameter \nmud-flush rotary coring method, one vertical and the other inclined. The inclined borehole \npenetrated the strata beneath the quarry floor. Both boreholes were drilled to a depth of about \n100 metres, the inclined borehole (angled at 45o to the horizontal) just reached the water table \nwhilst the vertical borehole penetrated some 20 m into the saturated zone.  A mud flush \nmethod was selected in order to minimise the contamination of porewater by drilling fluid \n 13\nand to prevent the mobilisation of DNAPL, should a \u2018pool\u2019 be penetrated (Sterling et al. \n2005). Large amounts of mud were required where major vertical fractures were intersected \nby the inclined hole??. The extent of invasion of the core by drilling mud was assessed by \nadding a lithium bromide tracer to each batch of drilling mud and subsequently analysing \nsamples of both the mud and porewaters for lithium.  \nA continuous lithological log was made for each length of core as soon as it was \navailable. From this log a lithotype code was allocated to each metre of core corresponding to \nthe average lithology.  The number of low-permeability bands per metre was also calculated. \nAll fractures were also logged, regardless of whether they may have been drilling-induced \nand the fracture density per metre calculated. The orientation of the fractures in the inclined \nhole was determined where it was possible to discern bedding laminations within the core. \nA detailed programme of core sampling and analysis was carried out (Table 3).  After \ncore logging, one 5-g core sample for CHCs from each sampling interval was weighed \ndirectly into a headspace vial, ultrapure water added and the vial sealed directly (Stuart \n1991).  Expected variations in aquifer properties on the sub-metre scale suggested that a \nsimilar vertical sampling interval would be appropriate and a spacing of 3 per metre was \nselected.  This should account for heterogeneities that occur at 2 to 4 metres scale, \ncorresponding to different channel units, and at 10s of cm, corresponding to different \nlithotypes. However it would not distinguish changes at the mm to cm scale.  Extra samples \nwere collected close to specific vertical fractures in the inclined borehole to determine if \nCHC concentrations were enhanced. \nAnalysis for CHCs was undertaken on site to allow rapid identification of the \npresence of DNAPL.  It was considered that if DNAPL were present either as \u2018residual\u2019 \nwithin the sandstone matrix or as a \u2018pool\u2019 it could be recognised by an \u2018apparent \nconcentration\u2019 (mass of CHC per volume of porewater calculated from solid sample weight \n 14\nand its moisture content) greater than the aqueous solubility (Fig. 3). It was thought that if \nDNAPL had migrated through only the fractures then any residual present might now have \ndisappeared given the low residual saturation in fractures compared with the matrix and the \nelapsed time between possible DNAPL migration and the investigation.  From measurements \nof diffusion rates, disappearance times for DNAPLs are expected to be in the order of years \nfor TCE and decades for PCE (Parker et al 1994). However even if residual saturation had \ndisappeared, areas of higher aqueous concentrations surrounding fractures might be \nanticipated. \n  Core samples for physical properties were sealed in plastic bags and subsampled and \nanalysed in the laboratory.   \nPorewater for determination of inorganic species was extracted by refrigerated high-\nspeed centrifugation on-site (Edmunds and Bath 1976).  pH was measured and alkalinity was \ndetermined immediately on-site by autotitration with dilute sulphuric acid.  Specific electrical \nconductance (SEC) was measured using a digital meter.  The remaining sample was divided \nand preserved as appropriate for cations, anions and dissolved organic carbon for later \nlaboratory determination.  \n   \nResults \nThe results indicated that groundwater in both the saturated and unsaturated zones contained \nboth CHCs and sodium\/calcium chloride well above the baseline concentrations observed by \nEdmunds et al. (1989).  The unsaturated zone concentration profile of both the CHCs and \ninorganic compounds showed very large changes in concentration over short vertical \ndistances.  The high frequency of sampling allowed the chemical data (organic and inorganic) \nto be compared and to be related to the physical characteristics of the rock matrix.  \n 15\nThere was generally very good qualitative correspondence between CHCs, SEC, the \nvarious lithological units and the density of fracturing, although there were a few exceptions \nas might be anticipated in a complex natural system. One such relationship is illustrated in \nFig. 4 where high contaminant concentrations in the porewaters appear to correspond with \nparts of the aquifer where mudstone layers were delineated by core and geophysical borehole \nlogging, perhaps indicating a degree of ponding on and diffusion into mudstone horizons (e.g. \nat 28, 21, 7 1 and \u20132 m OD).  The differing sampling interval and methodologies used for the \nvarious parameters makes a statistical analysis difficult. \nGeological logging indicated that the permeability of the sandstones (both vertical and \nhorizontal) was likely to vary by several orders of magnitude over depths of < 1 m.  \nLaboratory measurements for rock permeability and porosity were usually only made on \nsamples at 2-m intervals (Fig. 5).  Although more detailed information was gained from an \nassessment of the number of poorly-permeable bands per metre. The latter information is not \npresented but related well with both the permeability and with CHC concentrations. \nMeasurements using a field permeameter on a short section of sandstone core from a nearby \nborehole showed that sandstone permeability was in fact very variable on the cm to 10s cm \nscale. \nFracturing is often, but not always, related to lithology since many of the fractures \nappear to be bedding plane partings, which occur more frequently in the interbedded flaggy, \nfiner sandstones and mudstones.  The fracture density, as observed in the two rock cores, is \nalso compared with CHC concentrations in Fig. 5, generally with reasonably good \ncorrespondence. \nIn the inclined borehole the results of detailed subsampling close to the surfaces of \nidentified vertical fractures showed no evidence of enhanced concentrations of CHCs \nsupporting the likelihood of past rapid movement of non-aqueous or immiscible phase \n 16\ncontaminants within the fractures. The CHCs are believed to have migrated through the \nsandstones as the aqueous phase.  This is based on three independent lines of evidence: \n1. Concentrations of the main CHCs are generally below their aqueous solubility. The \naqueous solubility of individual CHCs depends on both the total concentration of salts \npresent in the solution and the total concentration of other CHCs present. PCE solubility \nin brine was calculated using the relationship described by Horvath (1982):  \nCS = CW \u00d7 10(-\u00b5S) \nwhere  CS is the solubility in salt solution, CW is the aqueous solubility, \u00b5 is the salt \ncoefficient and S is the salt concentration.. Assuming a salt coefficient of 0.081 l\/mol \n(Wilkinson pers com), PCE solubility was reduced from 150 mg\/l (Mercer and Cohen \n1990) to a minimum of 125 mg\/l by the maximum chloride detected in the zone below the \nbase of the quarry (34 g\/l). The effective solubility due to the presence of other CHCs can \nbe approximated using Raoult\u2019s Law (Broholm and Feenstra 1995): \nCm = Cw \u00d7 m \nwhere Cm  is the solubility of an individual component, Cw is the aqueous solubility and \nm is the molar fraction of the component in the mixture. Assuming that TCE and PCE are \nthe main CHC components and that there is an average molar ratio of PCE to TCE of 0.71 \n(Fig. 6) (slope of graph 1.11 \u00d7 molar weight of PCE\/molar weight of TCE), the molar \nfraction of PCE is 0.41 (0.71\/1 + 0.71). This further reduces the effective PCE solubility \nto about 51 mg\/l (125 \u00d7 0.41). However it should be recognised that there is some \nuncertainty in both the aqueous solubility of PCE and its modification due to the presence \nof high salinity and other CHCs. \nFig. 7 compares the PCE concentrations detected in both boreholes with this \ncalculated effective solubility.   Overall the PCE concentrations are well within the \naqueous limits with only a few peak concentrations exceeding the estimated effective \n 17\nsolubility limit for PCE.  Direct comparison of the results with the solubility estimates \nsuggests that migration of a small amount of DNAPL into the unsaturated zone \nunderneath the quarry cannot be ruled out.  However since the effective solubility is only \nan approximation, peak concentrations may in fact be within the aqueous limit. \nConcentrations of >10% of the relevant aqueous solubility are normally considered as \nevidence of the presence in the aquifer, at some stage, of the immiscible phase (Hunt et \nal. 1988).  This is not useful here since it is known that the immiscible phase was \noriginally present in the quarry fill and this would not be distinguished from immiscible \nphase in the unsaturated zone. \n2. The close coincidence of high concentrations of CHCs and inorganic species, such as \nchloride, calcium and sodium, suggests that the organic and inorganic components \nmigrated along the same pathways.  There are no instances of high CHCs in the absence \nof high inorganics. A number of sharp peaks at between 20 and 35 m OD in the inclined \nborehole indicate either spreading beneath the quarry floor across low permeability layers \nor fingering via vertical or subvertical fractures (Fig. 5). These mechanisms cannot be \neasily distinguished by a single borehole at 45o.  However the coincidence of peaks with \nlow permeability layers and the lack of CHC enhancement close to fractures suggests the \nformer.   \n3. The ratio of TCE: PCE is remarkably constant throughout the profiles (Fig. 6), which is \nconsistent with a large uniform source, but not necessarily of the aqueous phase. Had the \nCHCs migrated out of the quarry as a series of separate DNAPLs, different proportions \nare likely to have been present.  The two samples with the highest CHC concentration \nhave a different TCE: PCE ratio. This may be because they have been derived from \nDNAPL, although differences in the composition of the waste stream may also be a \nfactor. \n 18\nThe overall conclusion is that high concentrations of CHCs and inorganics are almost always \nassociated with less permeable bands in the profile, consistent with lateral migration of fluids \nabove these layers and possibly along bedding plane fractures.  It is suggested that this \nassociation in combination with downward movement through sandstones where mudstones \nhave pinched out or are discontinuous leads to the distribution in the subsurface shown \nschematically in Fig. 8. Both vertical and inclined boreholes intersect frequent horizontal \nlow-permeability layers and bedding plane fractures.  Even within individual channel units \nfine micaceous sandstones may be present and are likely to act as barriers. These low \npermeability units form the \u2018floors\u2019 of invaded matrix. Downward migration continues either \nwhere the low-permeability layers \u2018pinch out\u2019, or possibly where significant vertical fractures \nare present, producing \u2018pillars\u2019 of contaminated matrix. The spacing of these pillars is not \nknown but is assumed to be at least 10\u201320 metres.  This means that the likelihood of \nintersection by a vertical borehole is very small and that an inclined hole may only intersect \none or two.   In the case study all peaks in the CHC or inorganic profiles are associated with \nlow-permeability layers and there are none which could be unequivocally attributed to \nvertical migration.  \n \nSampling Density: Implications for Data Interpretation \nHaving made the above interpretations based on a sampling density for CHCs of 3 per \nvertical metre, it is useful to assess what impact different sampling frequencies and regimes \nwould have had on data interpretation and subsequent conclusions.  Four alternative scenarios \nwere considered: \n\u2022 Bulked samples (samples made up from subsamples within a given depth range) at 2 \nmetre intervals; \n\u2022 Bulked samples at 5 metre intervals.  \n 19\n\u2022 Spot samples (i.e. from discrete 1-cm depth range) at 2 metre intervals; \n\u2022 Spot samples at 5 metre intervals; \n \nBulk Samples \nFor convenience all the samples in the dataset shown in Fig.9a were used (equivalent to spot \nsamples at 0.3 m intervals).  For each interval all the results were combined into an \u2018average \nvalue\u2019 for that interval.  For 2 metre intervals this represented usually six subsamples.  The \nresults are plotted for 2 and 5 metre intervals in Fig. 9b and 9c. It can be seen from Fig. 9b \nthat when samples are bulked over 2-metre intervals the resolution of individual peaks is lost \nalthough the main contaminated zones are identified. It would be impossible from this dataset \nalone to determine the role of lithology on contaminant movement. When the interval is \nincreased to 5 metres the resolution is diminished further but the main zones can still be \nidentified. \n \nSpot Samples  \nSamples were selected at 2-metre intervals from the total data set. For convenience this was \nfrom even-numbered lengths along the core from the surface.  The samples were chosen \nmechanistically in that no account was taken of any lithological variations.  The results are \nplotted in Fig. 9d.   The loss of resolution is immediately apparent; whilst the main zones are \nstill identifiable, most of the small CHC peaks are not distinct.  The coincidence of high CHC \nconcentrations and the less permeable lithologies has disappeared and the maximum \nconcentrations are significantly lower by a factor of two or three.  Thus it would be difficult \nfrom this data alone to draw any conclusions on how these low-permeability layers control \ncontaminant transport. When the frequency is reduced to 5-metre intervals even the main \ncontaminated zones are \u2018lost\u2019 making any sensible interpretation impossible (Fig.9e). \n 20\nImplications \nThe implications of this are two-fold.  Firstly that the sampling interval selected is crucial \nespecially where the data are required either to indicate the controls on contaminant \nmovement or the maximum concentration in the subsurface.  Secondly where the number of \nanalyses needs to be limited, the bulking of samples is to be preferred to collecting \u2018spot\u2019 \nsamples.  The sampling interval needs to be selected with regard to the scale over which \nsignificant changes occur in the hydraulic properties of the aquifer, since this is correlated to \nthe presence\/absence of CHCs.  In this type of aquifer this would relate to bed thickness \nwhich at the case study site is typically on the sub-metre scale. At this particular site the \nfracture density did not appear to be a determining factor. \n \nConclusions \nFollowing spillages of CHCs on a dual porosity sandstone aquifer, significant quantities may \nbe retained in the unsaturated zone. Drilling to obtain concentration profiles in the \nunsaturated zone is likely to be required to establish their phase and distribution. These data, \ntogether with other information would provide the basis for a risk assessment and for any \nappropriate follow-up remediation or containment programme.  \nAt the case study site, detailed sampling of CHCs in deep boreholes was able to \nprovide invaluable information on both the extent and possible phase of contaminant \nmigration. Where CHC concentrations are high it may be difficult to distinguish whether \nmigration occurred as the aqueous or NAPL phase.  At this site the consistent ratio of the two \nmain CHC components of the plume provided strong evidence of movement in the aqueous \nphase and this was supported by the similar distribution of co-disposed aqueous phase \ninorganic components in the unsaturated zone. \n 21\nThe density or spacing of sampling is of crucial importance for understanding \ncontaminant movement and should be on a similar scale to the heterogeneity which governs \ncontaminant distribution. In the upper part of the Sherwood Sandstone aquifer of north west \nEngland, where significant parts of the aquifer have jigsaw-type architecture, significant \nchanges in lithological type and permeability occur over vertical distances of less than one \nmetre and samples need to be collected at this interval.  At frequencies of 2 metres or more \nconsiderable resolution and peak concentrations are reduced or not observed, and the \nrelationship with aquifer structure is unclear. \nThe bulking of samples over the sampled interval is more representative than spot \nsamples and should be preferred. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors are grateful to their many colleagues in BGS and ICI who have contributed to the \nwork described here.
