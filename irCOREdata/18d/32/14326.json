Laurillard (1993) has discussed this in depth, and has\nconcluded that any teaching strategy should make provision for a dialogue which reveals\nthe conceptions of both the teacher and the student. This allows the teacher to analyse the\nstudents' understanding, and to use this information to form the basis of subsequent\ndialogue.\n19\nT.J. Brailsfbrd et at Knowledge Tree: putting discourse into computer-based learning\nTraditionally this process has taken place in informal discussions, as well as in formal\nsmall-group learning sessions such as the (old-fashioned) tutorial. A real problem that is\ncurrently facing education is that as the student-staff ratio increases, so the opportunity\nfor personal dialogue decreases. In many university departments, tutorials have much less\npre-eminence than they once did because they are often not perceived as being a cost-\neffective form of teaching in comparison with declarative methods such as lecturing.\nIT-based teaching strategies\nComputer-based learning (CBL) is currently being widely promoted as the saviour of\nteaching quality in the face of diminishing resources. Although it is true that CBL has this\npotential, there is a real danger that if IT-based educational strategies are not\nimplemented very carefully they could damage the learning process. The majority of\ncourseware currently available is primarily declarative, embodying the 'show and tell'\nlearning model. When this is used as part of a carefully designed teaching strategy, such\nmaterial can be extremely valuable, but it must be remembered that it models only one\ntype of teaching.\nThe learning process can be viewed as a perpetual cycle of three phases, each of which can\npotentially be reproduced in courseware (Mayes, 1993; Mayes and Neilson, 1995). This\nstarts with the initial conceptualization of the subject material from declarative sources\n(for example, lectures or books). There are then phases of construction (for example,\nessay writing or problem solving) and dialogue. Students who fail to perform adequately\nin the construction or dialogue phases can be given the assistance they require to improve\ntheir conceptualization.\nMost pieces of courseware are intended for the primary exposition of subject material,\nand thus tend to be declarative in nature. This is what Mayes and Neilson (1995) have\ntermed primary courseware. Secondary courseware uses the constructionist model of\nlearning, and provides tools and objectives for students to enable them to manipulate\nresources (i.e. the students effectively become the authors of their own courseware).\nTertiary courseware provides distributed learning support, and in CAL it is this which\ncan create the dialogue that is so essential to effective learning.\nCollaborative learning\nBarrett (1989) has pointed out that when computers are used in education, the social\nprocesses of interaction and collaboration that occur during learning should be modelled in\nthe computer. Collaborative group-learning is a well established educational strategy, which\nis readily amenable to extension and enhancement by IT (Collis, 1994). In a study of a\ncomputer-supported collaborative learning system, Alavi (1994) found that students\nattained a higher level of skills development and self-reported learning than did their\nconventionally taught colleagues. An important aspect of this type of collaborative learning\nis that not only is there an opportunity for dialogue between students and their teachers, but\nthere are also opportunities for discussion amongst peers. A major feature of the JITOL\n(Just-In-Time Open Learning) project is that peer discussions are used to create a\nhyperstack of public knowledge (Boder, 1992; Goodyear and Steeples, 1992). The rationale\nof\" this is a process that Boder (1992) calls the 'reification of interactions'. This involves new\nknowledge being acquired by a recursive process of debate which stems from previous\nknowledge. This newly acquired knowledge is then used as the basis for continuing debate.\n20\nVolume 5 Number I\nThe recent massive expansion of global networking technology has provided a number of\nnew opportunities for learning through dialogue. Automated email distribution lists and\nUsenet news provide a means of distributed electronic debate. There are, however,\nproblems with using such systems for teaching. Email lists are an effective means for\ndistributing information to a large audience, but they tend to be a clumsy forum for\ndebates. If an individual subscribes to a significant number of lists, he or she will be\ncontinually bombarded with parts of discussions on a variety of subjects. Usenet is rather\nbetter on this score, but its intrinsically anarchic and ephemeral nature inevitably pose\nserious problems if it is used for teaching.\nThe Answer Garden approach to learning\nA number of systems, of varying levels of sophistication, have been developed that\naddress some of these problems. The most interesting and innovative of these has been\nthe Answer Garden (Ackerman and Malone, 1990; Ackerman, 1994).\nAnswer Garden was not originally designed for use in education, but rather for the\ndistribution of information from an organization's 'memory'. This 'organizational\nmemory' is that diffuse pool of authoritative knowledge present in an organization but\nnot in any individual. Answer Garden was designed to provide a means to tap this pool,\nand it was envisaged that this would be used for purposes such as technical support or\ncustomer hot-lines. In such environments there is a continual stream of questions, most of\nwhich recur frequently, but there are always some that are novel. Answer Garden presents\nusers with a branching network of diagnostic questions about their problem. If there is an\nappropriate answer in the database, this will be found; but if there is no such answer, an\nemail will automatically be sent to a relevant subject expert. Both the question and the\nanswer are eventually incorporated into the database which thus grows 'organically'.\nIn our view, this basic approach to knowledge dissemination is also highly applicable to\neducation. However, there are a number of ways in which the original Answer Garden is\nnot ideal for educational use, the most important of which is that each user is\nfundamentally isolated. He or she can see questions that others have asked in the past,\nbut has no knowledge of who else is currently using the system or what they are\ndiscussing. If used for teaching, Answer Garden would provide a student-teacher dialogue,\nbut no peer-peer interaction.\nIn order to address some of these issues we have developed a software system called\nKnowledge Tree (KT) inspired by the Answer Garden concept but extended in a number of\nimportant ways. We have been using this system in undergraduate teaching since early\n1994.\nKnowledge Tree: a collaborative learning tool for networks\nThe KT software combines a bulletin board (BB) functionality with a hierarchical\nconcept-oriented database to provide a structured environment to host and archive\ndiscussions at both a student-student and student-teacher level. Using KT, a knowledge\ngarden may be developed for any subject area, and these each contain a database of\nfrequently asked questions together with live discussions of problems and issues.\n21\nT.J. Brailsfbnj et al Knowledge Tree: putting discourse into computer-based learning\nSubject Kxpert\nfigure \/: The Knowledge Tree\nsystem model\nThe system model is shown in Figure 1. KT is divided in to two distinct but related\ncomponents called the Forum and the Knowledgebase. The Forum contains primarily\nstudent-student interaction and is essentially a threaded BB where students can ask\nquestions and participate in ongoing debates. New questions asked in the Forum are\nautomatically emailed to relevant subject experts, and together with the answers they are\narchived in the Knowledgebase, which is effectively a subject-specific hypermedia\ndatabase.\nEpistemology\nEach garden has its own subject-specific thesaurus consisting of a hierarchy of concepts\nthat is displayed as a folding 'outline'. In the Forum, students use this to attach a concept\nto their question, and in the Knowledgebase it forms a browser used for navigation. The\nthesaurus uses a system of upward inheritance to provide a powerful means of structuring\nany subject domain. For example, using the simple thesaurus shown in Figure 2, any\nConcept B rowser;;\n* Plants\nAnimals\n* Invertebrates\n=\u2022 Vertebrates\n\u2022=> Mammals\n\u2022= Carnivores\n4-Dogs\n\u2022=Cats\nLion\nTiger\nCheetah\netc... Figure 2: An example of a simple concept thesaurus to\nillustrate the use of inheritance\n22\nALT-J Volume 5 Number I\nquestion with the concept of 'tiger' attached to it would be found under Carnivores or\nCat, but not under Dog.\nDialogue in the garden\nIn the Forum, students can see the questions their peers have asked, and can comment on\nthem or answer them (see Figure 3). This results in discussion threads similar to those\nfound in Usenet or most BB systems. Articles in a thread are not automatically deleted,\nbut instead the entire thread is removed once it is obsolete. This avoids the problem of\ndecapitated threads that bedevils systems such as Usenet: frequently, users find they can\nread part of a thread, but not the original posting. This can lead to the vague ambling\nfrom one subject to another that is so common in news groups; it can be entertaining and\nsometimes informative, but it is not ideal for the type of debate that should be encouraged\nin education. While reading a thread in the Forum, the students may press a button and\njump to the appropriate Knowledgebase article (see Figure 4). KT thus supports dialogue\nboth between peers, and between students and their teachers. The Forum provides an\narea of dynamic debate, but Knowledgebase articles are permanent. Thus the garden\ngrows with time, eventually to become a valuable resource.\n'Edit\" Help\nKnowledge garden: Biological Anthropology\nKnowledgebase\nAbout this Author\nScntoc Lecturcf\nSrare any set criteria to distmgufsti a \"graafe' and Department of u e Science.B o * Size\n*>Bod> (ona\/ihape\nSkin colour\nSkeletal anitaa?\n4U\nUravenX; of Nottingham.\nGradte or robust? |t)\nVertebral epipwAaa\n\u2022S-Giofe\n* Betutvww\/fonctwn\n\u2022Evolution\n\u2022Knowledge fiaxlen\nNo LmequiyocBl, quantitative crib\nbegan with the discovery of clea\nfrom A GUKSIWS and A rabostui\nsample saes have gr '\nd the dtstottion [ih<\nbecome somewhat bt\nexample) predicted beAlometnc equationsCold adaptation.\nat rahuil? fit\nBrec3tn.iiobu.tTP}\nktal.ni.pl.?

In addition, it is used to\nsupport general IT queries in our department. Some long threads have been developed\nabout quite deep issues, and some of the student contributions have been of extremely\nhigh quality (in a number of cases we have transferred student answers directly to the\nKnowledgebase).\nOne of the main aims of KT is to lighten the burden of responding to student problems,\nas queries automatically go to the most appropriate available expert. Once a query is\nanswered, this is publicly available until it is no longer appropriate. A good answer\nshould promote reflection and further study rather than provide a package of self-\ncontained information. In the case of universities, the experts are likely to be academic\nstaff, although this need not be the case. It would be quite feasible to make use of\ngraduate students or teaching assistants to provide answers. There are also potentially\nmany more ways of using KT than we have yet tried. The effort that some students have\nput into writing articles in the Forum has convinced us that the system has potential as a\nconstructionist tool as well as a learning-support tool. It would be an interesting\nexperiment to run a student-administered garden, where groups of students are allocated\na subject domain for which they have to research and create their 'official' answer. It\nmight even be possible for students to create their own gardens from scratch for each\nother, as building a good thesaurus requires quite a deep understanding of the subject\nmaterial. Another possibility would be for teachers to ask questions in the Forum to seed\n24\nALT-} Volume 5 Number I\nstudent debate. KT can also be used on various different scales. On a large scale it can\nprovide support for an entire course and cover many different topics. It is equally usable\non a small scale, and would provide an interesting alternative to essay-writing in an\nelectronic equivalent of a tutorial group.\nIntegrated courseware and the future of CAL\nWe have found that KT can provide useful support for conventional teaching methods,\nand can be a valuable addition to conventional declarative CBL in that it can offer the\nstaff feedback and peer debate that CBL usually lacks. The real potential of this approach\nto learning will only be realized, however, with fully distributed systems. So far, KT has\nbeen used only to support collaborative learning on local-area networks. In the near\nfuture, we hope to run KT across wide-area networks, and this opens the interesting\npossibility of inter-institutional collaboration to provide distributed learning support.\nThus instead of a garden being tied to a single course in a single institution, it could be\nused to support similar courses running concurrently in several different institutions.\nStudents would thus be able to participate in debates with students in other institutions,\nand the subject experts would be drawn from the staff of all of the participating courses.\nThis would make the most effective use of available staff resources, and provide a\ndynamic learning experience for the students.\nAn interesting project that has implemented a distributed approach to the Answer Garden\nprinciple is the Answer Web system (Mayes and Neilson, 1995). This is effectively an\nimplementation of the original Answer Garden concept on the World Wide Web. The\nmost important aspect of this is that it can be used in an environment where the World\nWide Web is an important element of teaching, and thus it will be seamlessly integrated\ninto other courseware.\nWe hope eventually to integrate knowledge gardens with more conventional declarative\ncourseware, so that they simply become a tool in a learning-support environment. This\nraises the interesting possibility of a type of 'living hypertext', where a link in\nconventional courseware (possibly automatically generated) could take the student to a\nrelevant live discussion in which they could participate. This could, in principle, provide\ncomposite courseware that would contain the primary educational material, but would\nalso provide tools allowing students to collaborate with their peers and interact with\nteachers. Courseware of this type would then be much more capable of fulfilling the entire\nlearning process than most courseware available today, and it could thus be more safely\nused as a core component of teaching\nLectures and conventional teaching methods are likely to remain important for the\nforeseeable future, but courseware of the type described above could easily teach the\nmundane parts of many courses. Lectures could then become the inspirational perform-\nance they should be, rather than the mental filling stations they all too often become.\nAcknowledgements and further information\nWe are most grateful to Don Whittle and Craig Stewart for their help during the\ndevelopment and trials of Knowledge Tree.
