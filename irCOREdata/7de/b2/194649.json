Horv\u00e1th and co-\nworkers first introduced the concept of carrying out such\nreactions in a mixture of organic (often toluene) and per-\nfluorinated (often perfluoromethylcyclohexane) solvents,\nwhich are immiscible at room temperature.3,4 The catalyst is\ndesigned to be preferentially soluble in the fluorous phase and\nthe product is contained in the organic phase. Phase separation\nallows the ready recovery of the product, whilst the catalyst\nremains in the reactor. The advantage of this system over\naqueous biphasic systems5 is that a single phase is formed on\nheating, so the catalyst and substrate are in intimate contact, but\nphase separation occurs rapidly on cooling. Horv\u00e1th and co-\nworkers used P(CH2CH2C6F13)3 as the ligand for hydro-\nformylation and showed that a system could be developed that\ncould be used 9 times with loss of only 4.2% of the rhodium (i.e.\nan average of 0.45% per run or 120 mg (mol of aldehyde)21.4\nHowever, good linear selectivities could only be obtained if\nvery large excesses (total concentration) of the expensive\nfluorous ligand were employed.\nWe now report that triaryl-phosphines or -phosphites con-\ntaining fluorous ponytails can give higher rates and linear\nselectivities, particularly if the organic co-solvent (toluene) is\nomitted.\nOur initial ligand screening programme suggested that\nrhodium complexes of P(O-4-C6H4C6F13)36 could give good\nlinear+branched (l+b) ratios even when used in low concentra-\ntion, so we sought to optimize its performance. The results are\nshown in Table 1.\u2020 In toluene\u2013perfluoro-1,3-dimethylcyclohex-\nane (1+1), the activity is high even at low Rh (2 mmol dm23)\nand ligand concentrations (6 mmol dm23)\u2021 and increases with\ntemperature (experiments 3\u20135), whilst the l+b ratio is much\nhigher than that obtained with P(OPh)3 (experiment 1) or PPh3\n(experiment 2) under the same conditions in toluene or toluene\u2013\nperfluoro-1,3-dimethylcyclohexane. This higher l+b ratio arises\nlargely because of a decrease of branched aldehyde at the\nexpense of isomerised alkene, and there is only a marginal\nincrease in the selectivity towards the desired linear aldehyde.\nThe l+b ratio decreases somewhat with increasing temperature,\nsuggesting that ligand decomposition or reaction with the\nproduct aldehyde may be occurring. This is confirmed by the\nmuch increased leaching of both Rh and phosphorus into the\norganic phase at the higher temperatures.\u00a7\nOmitting toluene from the system leads to improvements in\nthe system such that the rate, the l+b ratio and the selectivity to\nlinear aldehyde are all increased (experiments 6\u20138). In addition,\nthe leaching of rhodium and phosphorus from the fluorous\n\u2020 Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: typical experi-\nmental details.

In the absence of\ntoluene the polar aldehyde phase separates as it forms, greatly\nreducing the possibility for destructive reactions between the\nphosphite and aldehyde. Increasing the concentration of the\ncatalyst and the ligand (experiment 9) increases the rate\nsomewhat, but also increases the l+b ratio, mainly again because\nmore isomerised alkene is produced at the expense of branched\naldehyde, although the best selectivity to linear aldehyde\n(75.6%) using this ligand is obtained with the higher catalyst\nand ligand loading at 60 \u00b0C (experiment 9). The leaching, in\nterms of percentage lost to the organic phase is also lowest at\n2.6% (20.6 mg Rh (mol of aldehyde)21) and 3.9% (28.6 mg P\n(mol of aldehyde)21). We have noted similar high l+b ratios\nwhen using triaryl-phosphites for reactions carried out in\nsupercritical fluids7 or ionic liquid\u2013supercritical fluid biphasic\nsystems.8\nGiven the problems of catalyst\u2013ligand instability experienced\nwith the fluorous derivatised phosphite, we investigated the use\nof the analogous phosphine, P(4-C6H4C6F13)3,6 which gives\nhigh rates for hydroformylation in scCO2,9 again using only the\nfluorous solvent, although in this case perfluoromethylcyclo-\nhexane (experiments 10\u201312). This ligand proved to be much\nmore stable than the phosphite and gave good rates and linear\nselectivities with little evidence for decomposition up to 80 \u00b0C,\nalthough increased Rh leaching occurred when reactions were\ncarried out at 90 \u00b0C (experiment 12). The best results were\nobtained with a rhodium loading of 2 mmol dm23 and a P+Rh\nratio of 10+1 (experiment 10). Even at this ratio, the phosphine\nconcentration is only 20 mmol dm23, compared with the\nloading of 152 mmol dm23 used by Horv\u00e1th and co-workers to\nobtain a similar l+b ratio with their phosphine,4 and a loading of\n200\u2013300 mmol dm23 used in commercial systems employing\nPPh3.1 The results obtained under these conditions, presented\ndiagrammatically in Fig. 1, show that a linear selectivity over\n80% can be obtained at a high rate and with excellent retention\nof rhodium (99.95%, loss of 0.08 mg Rh (mol aldehyde)21) and\nphosphorus (96.7%, loss of 15.9 mg (mol aldehyde)21) in the\nfluorous phase. These figures are compared with results\nobtained by Horv\u00e1th and co-workers4 and with results from\npublications and patents that are closely related to the\ncommercial systems1,10,11 in Fig. 2. This comparison shows that\nat similar rhodium concentrations and pressures to those used\ncommercially, but at much lower temperatures and phosphine\nloadings (important because of the cost of the fluorous\nphosphine), experiment 10 gives much higher rates (expected\nbecause of the lower phosphine loading) and comparable\nselectivities (l+b and linear aldehyde), especially when it is\nremembered that the commercial system uses propene, which\ncannot isomerise and in experiment 10, 3.7% of the selectivity\nis lost to alkene isomerisation. It seems that the major advantage\nin our system over the commercial systems is that high linear\nselectivities can be obtained at much lower phosphine loading\nand hence high rates do not need to be compromised.\nHorv\u00e1th and co-workers used a lower catalyst loading but\nhigher [phosphine], so it is not surprising that their rate was\nlower. Their selectivity was also lower but the leaching of\nrhodium per mol of aldehyde produced is similar in the two\nsystems. Although, they did not measure phosphorus leaching\nthey acknowledged that it was significant; we have estimated it\nat 3% per reaction (i.e. comparable to the losses we observe)\nbased on the change in l+b ratio and rate that they observed.\nWe conclude that triaryl-phosphines or phosphites bearing\nfluorous ponytails can give superior performance in terms of\nreaction rate, linear selectivity, and retention into the fluorous\nphase at lower ligand loadings than trialkylphosphine ana-\nlogues. Extra advantages in terms of all of these parameters are\nobtained by working purely in the fluorous phase, which offers\nthe added advantage that the alkene is completely miscible with\nthe solvent, whilst the aldehyde phase separates. In addition,\nthere are considerable advantages to the processing of the\nproduct since it does not have to be separated from an organic\nsolvent such as toluene.\nWe thank the Royal Society (EGH and AMS) and the EPSRC\nfor a Postdoctoral Fellowship (DJA) and for funding to use the\nCatalyst Evaluation and Optimisation Service (CATS). We are\nindebted to Ed McCurdy, Agilent Technologies UK Ltd. for\ncarrying out the ICPMS analyses.\nNotes and references\n\u2021 Low ligand concentrations are essential for the successful use of\nexpensive fluorinated ligands.\n\u00a7 Since the separation is always carried out at room temperature, a stable\ncatalyst at a given concentration of ligand and metal should give the same\namount of leaching regardless of the reaction temperature.\n1 C.
