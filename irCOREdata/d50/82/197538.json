However, her twelfth novel, Reader, I Married Him (2004), \nappears to mark a transition from feminist to feminine fiction, a form of writing  \nepitomised by chick lit, and one preoccupied with femininity, \u2018the dark \u201cOther\u201d of \nfeminism\u2019 (Hanson, p. 16). As the cover of Reader (approved by Roberts) indicates, \nthe novel self-consciously draws on the conventions of chick lit; it features a cartoon-\nstyle drawing of a woman sporting the contemporary signifiers of patriarchal \nfemininity, a handbag and high-heeled shoes. Alluding to the text that spawned the \ngenre, one reviewer even describes Roberts\u2019s middle-aged protagonist as \u2018a \nmenopausal Bridget Jones\u2019 (Ajay Close, p. 30). Like the re-publication of her third \nnovel The Wild Girl (1984) as The Secret Gospel of Mary Magdalene (2007) in the \nwake of Dan Brown\u2019s bestselling religious mystery The Da Vinci Code (2003), this \napparent shift from feminist to feminine fiction (from a focus on \u2018wimmin\u2019 to \u2018girlz\u2019) \ncould be interpreted as a cynical bid for commercial success. However, I propose that \nRoberts\u2019s latest novel expresses concerns central to her work \u2013 namely, a critical \npreoccupation with romance and a desire to challenge boundaries. Focusing on \nReader, I Married Him and the three novels that precede it - Fair Exchange (1999), \nThe Looking Glass (2000) and The Mistressclass (2003) - I argue that Roberts \nrewrites romance in order to stress both its perils and disruptive potential. Further, I \npropose that by highlighting the subversive appeal of romance, she recoups a \ndenigrated feminine genre and the women who cherish it. Finally, I suggest that by \ndrawing on literary and popular forms of romantic fiction, Roberts confounds the \n 2 \ncategories that structure the literary marketplace, rather than attempting to shift her \nposition in it. \n \nFair Exchange \nRoberts has described Fair Exchange, her first historical romance, as an homage to \nGeorgette Heyer, whose Regency romances she consumed avidly in adolescence. Like \nThese Old Shades (1926), the prototype of the formula for which Heyer became \nfamous (Hughes 39), Roberts\u2019s novel features a spirited protagonist, is set in \neighteenth century France and England, and uses the plot device of infants switched at \nbirth. Following Heyer, who is credited with transforming historical romance from an \nadventure story into a love story that appealed to women readers (Hughes 132), \nRoberts uses the genre to express specifically female concerns. Helen Hughes \nproposes that Heyer\u2019s work reflects on power relationships between men and women \n(17), stresses female vulnerability and articulates the impossibility of a woman\u2019s \nsituation in a patriarchal world (118). Like Heyer, Roberts uses romance to explore \nwomen\u2019s anxieties about relationships with men. \nWhile Roberts acknowledges her debt to the queen of Regency Romance, she \nalso describes Heyer\u2019s influence as \u2018damaging\u2019 because her books offered a \ndisempowering view of gender and heterosexual relations (Newman). As Hughes \nnotes, although Heyer plays with gender roles, her heroines finally submit to the \nsocial conventions they contest and endorse the myth that romantic love is the source \nof female fulfilment (Hughes 122). Even after embracing feminism, this is a myth that \nRoberts struggled to escape. She confesses that she still experienced a \u2018strong drive\u2019 \nto write romance (\u2018Write\u2019 228) and, reflecting this, Rosie White notes that her early \nfiction never entirely escapes the romance plot (73). Because Heyer\u2019s novels damaged \n 3 \nRoberts, she \u2018had to come back and deal with them\u2019 (Newman), and she does this in \nFair Exchange by rewriting romance.  \nFair Exchange underlines the damage wrought by romance through its two \nfemale protagonists, Jemima Boote and Annette Villon, both of whom internalise the \npatriarchal ideals of romantic love. Jemima is modelled on Mary Wollstonecraft and, \nlike her historical counterpart, falls prey to the seductive appeal of romance. Although \nWollstonecraft challenged the ideology of separate spheres that equated men with \nsense and women with sensibility in her revolutionary polemic Vindication of the \nRights of Woman (1794), passion overcame reason in her personal relationships with \nmen, causing her profound suffering. After a torrid affair, she was abandoned by her \nlover, Gilbert Imlay, shortly after the birth of their daughter. Unable to accept this \nrejection, Wollstonecraft\u2019s despair culminated in several suicide attempts.  \nIn Fair Exchange, Jemima\u2019s relationship with Paul Gilbert mirrors \nWollstonecraft\u2019s unhappy liaison with Gilbert Imlay. Although Jemima is \ncharacterised by reason \u2013 \u2018She had chosen well, she thought, a friendly man whom \nshe liked\u2019 (189) \u2013 she finds herself overwhelmed by emotions that \u2018entered her and \ntook her over\u2019 (189). Like Wollstonecraft, Jemima casts aside politics for passion: \nawaiting Gilbert\u2019s delayed and indefinite arrival, she passes the time \u2018pretending to \nwrite a political memoir and scribbling a romance in secret instead\u2019 (186). \nDisappointed by her lover, Jemima gives her romantic heroines \u2018more adventures than \nshe had had herself and less misfortune\u2019 (186-7), confirming Janice Radway\u2019s \ncontention that the appeal of the genre lies in its ability to satisfy emotional needs not \nmet in women\u2019s intimate relationships with men (Radway 94, 96). As Roberts \nexplains in her Preface to Madame Bovary (1857), romantic fiction simultaneously \narticulates and appeases female discontent: although it may enable women to explore \n 4 \nanxious questions, it tends to \u2018offer sentimental and reassuring answers\u2019 (Preface, \nMadame Bovary, viii). Jemima thus demonstrates that romance can function as a \ndangerous political sedative that maintains the patriarchal status quo. \nHowever, despite their similarities, Jemima is not Wollstonecraft and avoids \nthe painful fate of her historical counterpart. Wollstonecraft\u2019s appearance in the novel \nemphasises that the two figures are not the same. Indeed, by naming Jemima after the \nprison warden in Wollstonecraft\u2019s final (unfinished) novel Maria (1798), who \ndistrusts romantic fiction (in contrast to the eponymous heroine), Roberts points to the \nimportance of resisting romance. Resistance is also signalled by the marginalisation of \nJemima\u2019s lover and foregrounding of her relationships with women: her childhood \nfriend, Fanny, Annette (the novel\u2019s other protagonist) and her daughter. Furthermore, \nscenes of courtship and seduction are occluded until the end of the narrative, when \nthey are related in retrospect, confirming that Roberts is less concerned with romance \nthan its damaging effects. As Jemima\u2019s life does not feature the suicide attempts that \nhave defined Wollstonecraft as a tragic victim of a failed romance, and ends with her \ndiscovering a \u2018new cheerfulness\u2019 (241), Roberts celebrates her protagonist\u2019s sexual \npassion whilst saving her from the romantic delusions that almost destroyed the \nfounding mother of modern feminism.  \nRoberts\u2019s desire to rewrite romance is also evident in the parallels between \nFair Exchange and Wollstonecraft\u2019s Maria. Following the affair with Imlay, \nWollstonecraft poured her torment into this highly autobiographical novel, in which \nexcessive sensibility leads the protagonist, incarcerated in a madhouse by her cruel \nhusband, to mistake a fellow-prisoner for the hero of the romances she has read, and \nthus take as her lover a cad who later betrays and deserts her. Fair Exchange echoes \nthe central theme of Maria in its condemnation of the patriarchal structures that \n 5 \n\u2018preserve women as commodities in a system of exchange between men\u2019 (Neill 110), \nand both texts contain characters called Jemima and Maria, feature incarcerated \nwomen who become friends, feckless men who seduce and desert their lovers, and \nfathers who hide children from their mothers. Although incomplete, Wollstonecraft \nsketched several possible conclusions to Maria before her death, all unhappy. \nHowever, \u2018The End\u2019 is followed by a longer passage which offers an alternative, more \npositive, denoument: Jemima reunites Maria with her long lost daughter, who has \nbeen \u2018secreted\u2019 by her husband, inspiring Maria to live rather than die. Similarly, at \nthe end of Fair Exchange, Jemima has a daughter she thought dead returned to her \nwhen it is revealed that Gilbert and his friend Saygood swapped their daughters and \nthat Jemima is the biological mother of Annette\u2019s daughter, Caroline. By embracing \nthis conclusion, Roberts illustrates the central tenet of Rachel Blau DuPlessis\u2019s \nWriting Beyond the Ending (1985), that women writers resist the restrictive \nresolutions of the romance plot, subverting a literary tradition in which, for women, \ndeath is the only alternative to marriage.  \n \nThe Looking Glass \nThe Looking Glass continues to explore the damaging effects of romance on women \nwhilst rewriting literary and popular fictions, this time, Madame Bovary and The \nLittle Mermaid (1836). This novel relates the stories of five women, all connected to \nthe poet Gerard Colbert, based partly on Gustave Flaubert. Like Madame Bovary, The \nLooking Glass highlights the perils of romance but, as Sarah Falcus has shown, \nRoberts rewrites Flaubert\u2019s novel by revising the fate of his protagonist. Isabelle, \nColbert\u2019s mistress, closely resembles Louise Colet, Flaubert\u2019s lover and model for \nEmma Bovary. There are numerous parallels between the two women but, just as \n 6 \nJemima is not Wollstonecraft, Isabelle is not Emma. When Colbert ends their affair, \nIsabelle declares, having read Madame Bovary, \u2018I had decided on a better fate for \nmyself. I chose a happy ending, not a tragic one\u2019 (184). When she starts work, \nIsabelle relinquishes her romantic ideals. She has \u2018little time for being in love\u2019 and no \nlonger thinks of Colbert as \u2018the hero, the prince who would ride up and rescue me\u2019 \n(191; 193). In contrast to Emma, who is destroyed by romance, Isabelle finds \nhappiness in economic and emotional independence.  \nAlthough Falcus focuses on Isabelle, Emma\u2019s romantic inclinations are also \nshared by Millicent, Colbert\u2019s English governess. Through Millicent, Roberts \ndemonstrates that romance upholds patriarchy by equating femininity with silence, \nsubmission and suffering. Like Emma, Millicent\u2019s view of life is shaped by romantic \nfiction: she \u2018weave[s] her life into a shining love story like a cobweb spangled with \nrain\u2019 (158). Romance obscures her vision and Millicent, like Emma, idealises her \nlover: \u2018I can\u2019t imagine why I once thought him ugly\u2026Now I think him beautiful\u2019 \n(127). Reflecting Carol Thurston\u2019s observation that the traditional romantic heroine is \nquiet and unable to express her emotions (38), Millicent loses the ability to speak in \nthe presence of the poet: \u2018I could hardly form an opinion let alone shape it into words; \nI felt tongue-tied and stammering\u2019 (144). Furthermore, for Millicent, romantic love \nmeans self-denial: \u2018I love him and that\u2019s got to be enough. I must not ask for anything \nback\u2019 (127). Moreover, romantic love is masochistic; after cutting her hand Millicent \ncherishes her wound because \u2018It throbbed and stung, just like love does\u2019 (130). \nMillicent also confirms Radway\u2019s assertion that \u2018Passivity is at the heart of the \nromance experience\u2019 (97). Once dismissed from the Colbert household, she refuses to \nrelinquish her romantic fantasies: \u2018She existed in a kind of dreamy state, constantly \nre-imagining her next meeting with the poet, and the beautiful consequences which \n 7 \nwould ensue\u2019 (264). Only once Millicent is awoken from her paralyzing romantic \ndreams does she fulfil her own dream of becoming a poet. \nIf The Looking Glass rewrites Madame Bovary, it simultaneously revises Hans \nChristian Andersen\u2019s The Little Mermaid, whose protagonist epitomises the self-\nsacrificing romantic heroine. Reflecting their internalisation of romantic myths, each \nof Colbert\u2019s three lovers implicitly identifies herself as a mermaid. Millicent describes \nherself, slipping and slithering down the pebbles on the beach as \u2018transformed; \nanother creature\u2019 (140), and Isabelle dreams of swimming up the river to Colbert\u2019s \nhouse \u2018disguised as an eel or a carp or some such\u2019 and \u2018landing flop! on his carpet\u2019 \n(188). Although Genevieve, Colbert\u2019s housekeeper, compares herself to a mermaid \nmost often she also articulates a desire to revise dominant narratives: \u2018I began \nferociously to tell myself a story about a mermaid; only this time she would not die; \nshe would escape; she would dive into the depths of the sea and hide there\u2019 (84).  \nGenevieve resists the grand narrative of romance, realizing \u2018I was not condemned to \nrepeat the mermaid story from now till eternity. I could grow up; I could move; I \ncould get away\u2019 (89).  However, highlighting the power of patriarchy, initially she \nreplays the story that she seeks to rewrite. Like the Little Mermaid, Genevieve leaves \nhome to live with a man who does not love her and gives up language: \u2018Words were \nsomething I seemed to have left behind\u2019 (149). The danger of identification with the \nmermaid is underscored by Genevieve\u2019s plan to drown herself: \u2018Sooner or later the \nmermaid had to return to the sea, which was her only true home\u2019 (250). However, \nafter leaving Colbert and relinquishing her romantic fantasies, Genevieve no longer \nidentifies with the archetypical romantic heroine: \u2018the mermaid had gone. She had \nswum off and I was left alone\u2026with a feeling of lightness\u2019 (270). The retreat of the \nmermaid signals her rejection of romance and the possibility of happiness. \n 8 \nLike the Little Mermaid, Genevieve has no mother, and the heroine\u2019s \nmotherless state offers an insight into the powerful appeal that romance holds for \nfemale readers. Radway proposes that despite its preoccupation with men and \nmarriage, romance represents an unconscious quest for maternal nurturance (124). \nHer thesis draws on the psychoanalytic work of Nancy Chodorow, who employs a \nfeminist interpretation of Freudian object relations theory to analyse how the \npatriarchal context of mothering shapes female development. Chodorow argues that \nthe daughter\u2019s intense identification with the mother leads to incomplete separation \nfrom her in the oedipal stage, producing a continuing need for maternal nurturance \nand a desire to regress into infancy and reconstruct the lost intensity of the mother-\ndaughter bond (Radway 136). Radway proposes that through its promise of \u2018utopian \nbliss\u2019 romance offers women a means of recovering the mother (100), of re-\nestablishing the blissful pre-oedipal union between mother and child (151; 156), and \nthus satisfies desires that heteropatriarchy either represses or dictates must be met \nthrough men (140). Roberts echoes Radway in her view of romance as a quest \nnarrative in which the heroine searches for the \u2018lost mother\u2019 (\u2018Write\u2019 227).  \u2018The \nhero\u2019, she claims, \u2018symbolizes the mother\u2019 (\u2018Write\u2019 227), and she compares the \nblissful kiss that typically draws the romantic novel to a close with \u2018the ecstatic \npleasure of the tiny girl sucking on her mother\u2019s milk\u2019 (FSG 16). Likewise, Roberts \nconnects the pleasures of reading romance with maternal nurturance in her description \nof romantic fiction as \u2018good milk\u2019 (FSG 54).  \nLike the archetypal romantic heroine (and like Jemima in Fair Exchange), \nGenevieve is an orphan thrown into an unfamiliar environment and emotional \nisolation when she moves to a new town. However, rather than meeting a man, \nGenevieve finds a longed-for mother-figure in her employer, Madame Patin. She \n 9 \ncompares her arrival to birth -  \u2018I fell down that last stretch of road as though I were \nbeing born\u2019 (11) - and soon experiences the emotional and physical satisfaction of \nmother-love: \u2018This was what it must be like to have a mother, I thought, this loving \nher and being allowed to be near her\u2019 (34). The imagery she employs to describe her \njoy evokes the bliss associated with the maternal breast: \u2018goodness and plenty in the \nland of milk and honey\u2026paradise\u2019 (44-45).  \nMadame Patin\u2019s name, which evokes the slang for \u2018French kiss\u2019 (rouler un \npatin), indicates that the mother is implicated in romance. Furthermore, whereas the \nromantic heroine longs to be rescued by a lover, Genevieve longs to be saved from a \nlover by her mother, suggesting that she is the real object of desire. When Madame \nPatin marries, Genevieve reluctantly becomes embroiled in a sexual relationship with \nher husband and longs for her surrogate mother to end the affair: \u2018I longed for her to \nrescue me\u2019 (77). Upon discovery, Genevieve flees, only to be rescued by Colbert and \nbecome his lover. However, water imagery suggests that Colbert functions as a male \nmother through whom Genevieve seeks to assuage the loss of maternal love. Radway \nproposes that the goal of romance is oceanic merging with an other (153), a metaphor \nthat evokes the semiotic, the pre-oedipal realm that Kristeva defines in terms of \nfluidity and associates with the \u2018mother\u2019s body\u2019 (27). Genevieve uses sea imagery to \narticulate sexual desire: \u2018Something powerful, a tide of wanting, was drawing me \ntowards him and pushing me back, forward and back, like the rhythm of the sea itself, \nthe waves falling urgently onto the beach\u2026I thought I might turn to water\u2019 (144).  \nThe oceanic metaphor Genevieve employs to describe her relationship with Colbert \nechoes that used to convey the happiness inspired by Madame Patin: \u2018It went on \nmoving up and down inside me, like the waves swelling and breaking on the beach\u2019 \n(34). Sea imagery thus suggests Colbert\u2019s status as a mother substitute. \n 10 \nChild-like hunger and cave imagery indicate that Colbert functions as a \nmother substitute not only for Genevieve but also for his other lovers, Millicent and \nIsabelle. Radway proposes that the romantic heroine desires to be nurtured as an \ninfant by its mother (146), and, like Genevieve, who is a \u2018hungry child\u2019 in Madame \nPatin\u2019s presence (40), Millicent feels \u2018childish\u2019 with something inside her \u2018starving \nand shouting\u2019 (104), and Isabelle wonders if it is \u2018childish\u2019 to seek in her lover the \nsatisfaction she does not find in her husband (186). Caves and mothers are linked by \nGenevieve\u2019s desire to live with Madame Patin \u2018at the bottom of the sea in a cave \nmade fast with coral and guarded by dragons\u2019 (66), a home reminiscent of that \ninhabited by the pagan mother goddess, Cybele. Colbert is implicitly compared to \nCybele, traditionally represented by a black stone set in a silver statue, when Isabelle \nimagines their affair \u2018like a silver statue hidden in a cave\u2019 (186). The symbolic \nsignificance of caves suggests that when Millicent sits in a cave with Colbert on the \nbeach the desire she feels for him is an unconscious expression of a desire for her \nmother, to whom she eventually returns. Underlining that the mother is the primary \nobject of desire in romance, the novel ends with Genevieve likewise preparing to \nreturn to Madame Patin, her surrogate mother. By bringing to the fore female desires \nthat Radway suggests are submerged in romance, Roberts challenges the commonly \nheld view that women read romantic novels because they are \u2018weak and silly\u2019 \n(Preface viii), and suggests that the appeal of the genre lies in its ability to give covert \nexpression to taboo female desires.   \n \nThe Mistressclass \nIn The Mistressclass, Roberts turns her attention to one of the ur-texts of romantic \nfiction, Jane Eyre (1847), and examines the historical figures upon whom the \n 11 \narchetypal romantic couple (Jane and Rochester) are modelled: Charlotte Bronte and \nher Belgian teacher, Constantin Heger.1\nLike the two novels that precede it, The Mistressclass stresses that romance \nengenders masochism in, and antagonism between, women. Charlotte is passionately \nin love with Heger, her \u2018master\u2019 (3). His mastery is professional and personal: she is \nhis pupil and longs to be his mistress. The dangers of dependence are clear when \nCharlotte tells Heger that she cannot write because \u2018you are not close to me, to inspire \nme and argue with me and spur me on\u2019 (7). In contrast to the needy Charlotte, Heger, \nlike Rochester, is \u2018cool and impersonal\u2019 (44). He is also cruel and Charlotte cherishes \nthe pain that he inflicts: \u2018I treasured every savage and satirical rebuke you scrawled in \nmy margins\u2019 (3-4). She longs to be in his presence, even though it is \u2018torture\u2019 because, \nas Madame Heger informs her, \u2018real love involves real pain. It must hurt or it\u2019s not \nlove\u2019 (41; 182).  \n Inspired by Bronte\u2019s letters to Heger, the \nnovel offers a fictional account of their relationship. As well as reimagining Bronte\u2019s \nromantic life, Roberts intersperses Charlotte\u2019s unsent letters to Heger with a parallel \nnarrative about a contemporary love triangle that rewrites Jane Eyre. \nBoth the nineteenth century and contemporary narratives illustrate that \nromance divides women against each other. Charlotte and her sister Emily compete \nfor Heger\u2019s attention just as modern-day sisters Vinny and Catherine vie for Adam, \nwho moves from being Vinny\u2019s boyfriend to Catherine\u2019s husband. Like Charlotte, \nCatherine and Vinny are both happy to adopt the role of mistress. Vinny longs to be \nAdam\u2019s lover (even though he is married to her sister) and Catherine is content to be \n                                                 \n1 Roberts\u2019s novel challenges Lyndall Gordon\u2019s view that Bronte begins Jane Eyre having \u2018worked off \nthe Brussels experience\u2019 in The Professor (1846) (p. 144), and does not return to her preoccupation \nwith Heger until Villette (1853), \u2018her most autobiographical treatment of their relationship\u2019 (p. 110), by \nsuggesting that Jane Eyre is shaped as much by Bronte\u2019s passion for her tutor as the novels that deal \nwith the relationship more directly. Despite her assertion that Jane Eyre does not draw on the Brussels \naffair, Gordon concedes that Rochester resembles Heger (p. 148). \n 12 \nthought to be intimately involved with father-in-law: \u2018People assumed she was his \nmistress and she let them\u2019 (245). All three women are willing to embrace a \ndisempowering role: while \u2018master\u2019 suggests control and authority, \u2018mistress\u2019 denotes \na man\u2019s lover, illustrating that female identity is defined in relation to men. \nWhilst critical of romance, Roberts again reveals its appeal by presenting \nHeger as a male mother. The motherless Charlotte expresses her desire for nurturance \nand implicitly casts Heger in a maternal role: \u2018The language that links us is an \ninvisible, living cord\u2026.If I were not connected to you by that cord then I should die\u2019 \n(3). She later compares herself to a child seeking parental approval: \u2018I yearned to \nremain in your presence, to please you in every possible way, and never to arouse \nyour wrath\u2019 (43). Charlotte\u2019s longing makes it clear that romantic love and fiction \nexpress a desire for mother-love: \u2018I had no mother. No mother I could know or \nremember\u2026I stoppered up my child-self; all its longings. Only in reading and writing \ncould they emerge and live freely. Only when I met you and began to love you. Then \nout they leaped\u2019 (77).  \nAs well as highlighting the subtext of romance, Roberts rewrites the rules of \nthe genre when Charlotte transfers her affection from a master to a mistress. Heger is \nusurped by an alternative mother-figure, George Sand (a fictional version of the \nnineteenth century cross-dressing French author who paved the way for other \nprofessional women writers). Having been nursed back to good health and encouraged \nto write by her new surrogate mother,  Charlotte tells Heger, having \u2018gnawed at the \nhalf-eaten crusts on the floor under your table like a ravening dog\u2019 (77), Madame \nSand \u2018fills me up with good things\u2019 (232). Once she acquires the maternal nurturance \nshe seeks, Charlotte is \u2018cured\u2019 of romantic love and ready to \u2018write another novel\u2019 \n 13 \n(235; 293). Having renounced her desire to be Heger\u2019s mistress, she is able to write \nher \u2018masterpiece\u2019 (67). \nLike Charlotte, Vinny and Catherine are motherless and mourn the maternal \nnurturance they once enjoyed. Having her hair washed in a salon reminds Catherine of \nbeing in the bath with Vinny as a child and she feels \u2018soothed\u2019 (21), \u2018comforted\u2019 (22), \nand \u2018cossetted\u2019 (23), sensations akin to those experienced in the womb or at the \nmaternal breast (23). Dozing on a train, Vinny becomes \u2018a baby again, held on mum\u2019s \nlap\u2026she could have as she wanted\u2019, an experience that brings \u2018sweetness and bliss\u2019 \n(126). When she wakes with the realization that her mother is dead, \u2018Tears wanted to \nspill\u2019 (127). For both sisters, romance, in the form of Jane Eyre, offers emotional \ncompensation for the loss of mother-love.  \nBoth sisters identify closely with Jane Eyre. Catherine teaches the novel and \nVinny knows it \u2018almost by heart\u2019 (49). Even though she claims not to believe in \nromantic love, which is a \u2018delusion, a snare. Bourgeois ideology\u2019 (124), Vinny is \nsubsumed with romantic desire. She holds the lilac she has picked like \u2018a bride\u2019 and \ncompares its scent to \u2018the wafts of perfume drifting through the garden of Thornfield \non that Midsummer\u2019s Eve\u2019 when Mr Rochester tells Jane that he loves her (51-2). \nVinny also \u2018wishes she were the sort of woman you meet in novels, who just radiates \na soft feminine sexuality that has the hero madly in love with her within three \nseconds\u2019 (115), and her name, which Catherine truncates to \u2018Vin\u2019, suggests that she \nfunctions as Plain Jane\u2019s modern double: \u2018Vin de table, Catherine labelled her: Vin \nordinaire\u2019 (175). Catherine\u2019s yearning for a romantic hero suggests that she likewise \nidentifies with Bronte\u2019s romantic heroine: \u2018Charlie might not scowl like Mr Rochester \nbut he would do\u2019 (62).  \n 14 \nHowever, as the narrative progresses, Catherine and Vinny become as \ndisillusioned and resistant to romance as Charlotte. Parallels between Catherine and \nMrs Dalloway, both middle-aged women who wander through London buying \nflowers in preparation for a party, emphasise that Roberts, like Woolf, opposes the \ntraditional romance plot. DuPlessis argues that in Mrs Dalloway (1925) Woolf \ndisplaces romance from the center of the narrative and from this point on it never \nagain appears in her work \u2018assumed or unquestioned\u2019 (47-8). Vinny\u2019s rejection of \nromance is anticipated by an allusion to another novel by Woolf.  Towards the end of \nOrlando (1928), Woolf\u2019s eponymous protagonist sees an incomplete sign that reads \n\u2018Amor Vin-\u2019 (212). Vinny\u2019s name echoes this sign, likewise fracturing, and rendering \nmeaningless, the romantic motto \u2018Amor vincit omia\u2019 or \u2018love conquers all\u2019 (DuPlessis \n62).  \nVinny\u2019s scepticism towards romance is expressed through her growing \ndissatisfaction with fairy tales. Reflecting Radway\u2019s observation that romances are \nlike fairy tales (109), Vinny initially views life through a fairy tale lens: she describes \nherself and Catherine as \u2018Babes in the Wood\u2019 (107), the setting of their holiday home \nin France as \u2018fairytale\u2019 (128), and Adam as \u2018the prince in disguise\u2019 (128). Later, \nhowever, Vinny rejects fairy tales and the simple binary oppositions that underpin \nthem: \u2018Who were those two sisters in that French fairy tale? Rose Red and Snow \nWhite. One good and one bad. One feminine and one not\u2026.Was that the right story? \nNo, Vinny shouted to herself: too simplistic\u2019 (139-40). Vinny\u2019s desire to rupture the \nbinary oppositions that define women as good or bad and position them as rivals is \nreflected in her twin kinship with Jane Eyre and Bertha Mason, Rochester\u2019s first wife. \nLike Bertha, Vinny is described as a \u2018madwoman\u2019 and \u2018monster\u2019 (105; 224), and \nfantasises that she is an \u2018arsonist\u2019 (176). This dual identification echoes readings of \n 15 \nBronte\u2019s novel that suggest Bertha represents the socially unacceptable side of Jane \n(her sexual desire and rage) but also subverts the traditional construction of women as \nantagonists. \nVinny\u2019s rejection of narratives that construct women as rivals (like Snow-\nWhite and Rose-Red) allows the novel\u2019s various love triangles to be redrawn: the \ntriangle in the modern-day narrative (Vinny-Adam-Catherine) reflects the triangle that \nCharlotte transposes from her life (Charlotte-Heger-Heger\u2019s wife) to her fiction (Jane-\nRochester-Bertha). Initially, Vinny and Catherine are set against each other in the \nsame manner as Jane and Bertha in Jane Eyre. However, whereas Bronte has Bertha \nfall to her death, so that Jane and Rochester can marry, Roberts has Adam fall from a \nbridge. Although he does not die, the removal of Adam enables Catherine and Vinny \nto renew their relationship, suggested by the possibility of a travelling to India \ntogether. As Roberts\u2019s woman-centred title indicates, the lesson that women learn in \nThe Mistressclass is not to seek fulfilment in romantic relationships with men. \n \nReader, I Married Him  \nAs the cover and title indicates, Reader, I Married Him blends canonical nineteenth \ncentury romantic fiction, epitomised by Jane Eyre, with its contemporary offspring, \nchick lit: a modern form of romantic fiction that follows the comic misadventures of a \nsingle, professional, young woman as she struggles to find Mr Right. While alluding \nto Bronte\u2019s classic, the novel simultaneously invokes Gillian Beer\u2019s influential study \nof Austen, Bronte, Eliot, and Gaskell, which bears the same title. Despite Beer\u2019s \ninterest in romance, in her capacity as a 2002 Orange Prize judge she denounced \nchick lit and celebrated the demise of writing by women that deals with romantic \n 16 \nlove.2\nReader focuses on Aurora, whose romantic inclinations are signalled by her \nidentification with the heroines of her \u2018favourite novels\u2019 (24), the classic romantic \nnarratives that form the basis of Beer\u2019s study: \u2018I felt like Dorothea in Middlemarch, \nwhen, after her dreary courtship by Casaubon, Will Ladislaw suddenly comes into her \nlife\u2019 (49); \u2018I translated. Like Anne Elliott in Persuasion, at the concert in Bath, I gave \njust the gist of the speech\u2019 (169); \u2018Like Mr Darcy watching Elizabeth cry in Pride and \nPrejudice, he [Frederico] observed me in a compassionate silence\u2019 (184). As \nDuPlessis points out, these are all novels in which the heroine\u2019s quest for self-\nrealization is ultimately subordinated to the marriage plot (7). Like the novel that has \ncome to define chick lit, Helen Fielding\u2019s Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary (1996), which draws \non Austen\u2019s Pride and Prejudice (1813) (the first book that Roberts ever bought), and \nlike its sequel, Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason (1999), which parallels the plot of \nAusten\u2019s Persuasion (1818), Roberts\u2019s allusion to nineteenth century novels suggests \nthat, despite the changes wrought by feminism, modern relationships between men \nand women remain largely unreconstructed in the personal sphere.   \n  By embracing chick lit, Roberts offers a playful retort to Beer\u2019s literary double \nstandard whilst continuing to explore the seductive power of romance.   \nInitially, Reader appears to adopt the typical features of romantic fiction. In \nthe exotic setting of Italy, Aurora pursues her passion for the handsome Father \nMichael, a man who bears all the hallmarks of the romantic hero: \u2018mysterious\u2019 (37), \n\u2018unattainable\u2019 (131), and macho \u2013 he rides a Harley Davidson and wears \u2018Eau \nSauvage\u2019 aftershave (45). The dangers of romance are highlighted when, dancing with \nMichael, Aurora, who normally prefers \u2018to act rather than reflect\u2019 (156), relinquishes \ncontrol and allows herself to be \u2018swept away\u2019 (131). Illustrating that romance \n                                                 \n2  See Angelique Chrisafis, \u2018Women\u2019s writing leaves sex behind\u2019, The Guardian, 10 June, 2002, p.5 \n 17 \neroticises male dominance and female submission, Aurora exclaims, \u2018Born along by \nhis strength, all I had to do was yield, follow. It was blissful!\u2019 (130-1). The blindness \nengendered by romantic love is underlined when swollen mosquito bites prevent \nAurora from opening her eyes and when she picks up the wrong spectacles and, \nblinded by love, she fails to see that the hero is a rake incapable of offering her love, \ncare and commitment.  \nHowever, inspired by capriccio, a form of landscape painting that involves the \nplayful transgression of norms, Roberts subverts the conventions of chick lit by \nreinventing the romantic heroine. As her name (meaning \u2018dawn\u2019) suggests, Aurora is \na new kind of heroine. In contrast to the calorie-counting, thirty-something Bridget \nJones, the middle-aged Aurora is a woman of appetite: offered three different \nspecialities in a restaurant, she tells the waiter, \u2018I\u2019ll have the lot\u2019 (93). Roberts also \ndebunks a stock romantic device. Aurora regards Father Michael\u2019s appearance in Italy \nwhile she is on holiday there as a \u2018coincidence\u2019 (50), but it transpires that he is an \nundercover detective pursuing her on suspicion of murder. Thus, running into each \nother is \u2018Not synchronicity after all\u2019 (227). Subverting the traditional male role, Father \nMichael turns out to be less a hero than a villain. Quashing all hopes of romance, he \ncallously informs Aurora that he only slept with her to elicit information and she later \nwitnesses him picking up a prostitute.  \n In the manner of many romances, Reader presents its heroine with two \npotential partners and Frederico, the feminine museum director, functions as an \nalternative hero. Following the formula of romance, in which a misunderstanding \nkeeps the true lovers apart, Aurora initially discounts Frederico as a romantic prospect \non the grounds he is gay. However, Roberts subverts the conventions she invokes by \nturning the gay male friend, a stock chick lit character, into the hero, albeit one who \n 18 \nresists dominant definitions of gender. In Food, Sex and God (1998), Roberts \nproposes that part of the unconscious appeal of romance lies in its subversion of \ngender roles: \u2018Under its cloak of convention, the romance allows for some disruptive \ngoings on, for the fixed categories of gender to lurch about a little\u2019 (16). Like \nRochester, whose \u2018rampant masculinity\u2019 is undercut by his cross-dressing (FSG 16), \nFrederico is an ambiguously gendered hero. He has some of the hero\u2019s typically \nmasculine features: like Rochester or Darcy, he is \u2018standoffish\u2019 (73), and like Father \nMichael he too wears \u2018Eau Sauvage\u2019 (115).  Yet, in contrast to the classic hero, \nFrederico is \u2018no mystery\u2019 (122), and possesses several feminine characteristics. He is \nemotionally articulate, he can put \u2018feelings into words\u2019 (207), has \u2018Masculine \nintuition\u2019 (207), and is \u2018oddly nervous\u2019, rather than sexually dominant, in the bedroom \n(209). These feminine attributes subvert the \u2018extremes of sexual difference\u2019 on which \ntraditional romance is based (DuPlessis 5), and undercut what Imelda Whelehan terms \nthe \u2018emotional separatism\u2019 of chick lit (Bridget 68), epitomised by Bridget Jones\u2019 \nfavourite advice manual, John Gray\u2019s Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus \n(1993). Roberts further feminises her hero, and makes explicit the subtext of the \nclassic romance narrative, when Frederico offers the motherless Aurora maternal \nnurturance: after a series of missed lunches, he feeds the \u2018hungry\u2019 heroine (206). The \nimportance of the mother is signalled by the opening words of the novel - \u2018My \nmother\u2019 (1) \u2013 and the theme of the male mother is underlined by the revelation that \nAurora\u2019s step-mother, Maude, is a man. \n Roberts\u2019s resistance to the tropes of romantic fiction is underlined by the \nnovel\u2019s conclusion: Frederico does not propose. Whelehan notes that \u2018feminist fiction \ntakes its heroines out of marriage into singledom, [whereas] chick lit moves in the \nopposite direction\u2019 (Feminist 4). While the chick lit heroine is desperate to marry, the \n 19 \nthrice-married Aurora finally escapes the romantic myth that \u2018a woman\u2019s greatest \nhappiness lies in love and marriage\u2019 (Jones 198). Reader draws to a close with the \nlovers temporarily parting, rather than uniting, and ends with murder rather than \nmarriage: Aurora shoots Michael and confesses, \u2018Reader, I murdered him\u2019 (229). The \nfigure on the cover of the novel may be adorned with the trappings of hegemonic \nfemininity but, anticipating Roberts\u2019s departure from the conventions of gender and \ngenre, she also holds a gun. \nBy the end of the novel, Aurora has learned to be wary of romance: \u2018A \nwarning bell clanged in my memory. Hastily I promised myself that this time I would \nbe careful, at the beginning, not to become too romantic\u2019 (224). As her attitude to \nromance changes so does her attitude to sex. In contrast to Bridget Jones, who seeks \ncommitment rather than casual sex, Aurora abandons her belief that \u2018You were only \nsupposed to have sex if you were married\u2019 (33). Further, while chick lit tends to be \ncoy about sex (Whelehan, Feminist 206), Roberts offers a candid representation of the \npleasures of the flesh. In her essay \u2018Write, she said\u2019, Roberts states that she wants to \ncounter the myth that romance is to women what pornography is to men by joining \nthe two genres (\u2018Write\u2019 233). Reader goes some way towards achieving this aim and, \nin doing so, challenges the \u2018literary separatism\u2019 that chick lit endorses (Whelehan, \nBJD 68). In contrast to Mills & Boon novels, in which orgasms are \u2018always vaginal, \nalways single, simultaneous with the man\u2019s and experienced in missionary position\u2019 \n(Jones 210), Roberts offers a woman-centred representation of sex that counters the \nmyth of the vaginal orgasm and affirms female sexual pleasure: \u2018He pulled off my \nknickers, slid his fingers in, found my clitoris, circled it\u2019 (213). Reader, I Married \nHim may not be quite the \u2018lesbian sado-masochistic romantic pornographic epic\u2019 that \n 20 \nRoberts once said she wanted to write (\u2018Write\u2019 234), but it does transform chick lit \ninto what might be better termed \u2018clit lit\u2019. \nRoberts\u2019s interest in romance reflects her socialist as well as her feminist \nsympathies. Aware from an early age that romance is regarded as \u2018trivial and banal\u2019 \n(\u2018Write\u2019 222), and that \u2018trash\u2019 is a term used to describe not only romance but also, \nimplicitly, its (overwhelmingly female) readership (FSG 15), Roberts learned to hide \nher shameful desire for romantic fiction, which she consumed in secret. As Karen \nWestman notes, historical romance is regarded as \u2018bottom of the literary pit\u2019 and \nHeyer as \u2018Jane Austen \u201clite\u201d\u2019 (Westman 165-6). By claiming writers like Heyer and \nWollstonecraft as twin influences, Roberts situates herself in a specifically female \nliterary tradition and erodes the boundary between high and popular culture. The \nsuggestion that literary, mass-market and middlebrow romance explore similar \nconcerns exposes the arbitrary nature of literary value, confirming Pierre Bourdieu\u2019s \ncontention that cultural capital (forms of knowledge that confer power and status) \nworks to reify class difference and legitimate the dominance of the ruling elite. By \nblending allusions to canonical and non-canonical texts, Roberts subverts the \ndistinctions that maintain class hegemony and that shape the literary marketplace. \nIn conclusion, like the anonymous aphorism \u2018It begins when you sink in his \narms and ends with your arms in his sink\u2019, Roberts demystifies romance, revealing \nthat it upholds patriarchy.  Yet, while she shows that romance is complicit with the \ndominant order, Roberts also illustrates that it gives unconscious expression to a \ntransgressive desire for the mother. By rewriting romance, Roberts brings the \nsubversive potential of the genre to the fore and subverts the social and literary \nhierarchies that affirm the value of canonical texts like Jane Eyre but dismiss the \npopular romances they inspire, and the women who read them. As her most recent \n 21 \nfiction demonstrates, it is only by revising romance (and the values of the literary \nmarket) that women can live - and read - happily ever after.  \n 22 \nWorks Cited \n \nBourdieu, Pierre.
