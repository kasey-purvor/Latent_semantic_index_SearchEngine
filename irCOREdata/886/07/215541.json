We all \nlearn from other people\u2019s experience. This is a characteristic we share with other social \nanimals: for example rats will observe their conspecifics and choose or avoid the same foods \n(Strupp & Levitsky, 1984). This way of learning through the transmission of other\u2019s \nexperience of course has adaptive value (in this case, avoiding poisonous foods). In fact \n2 \nsocial animals have developed empathic competences, which enable them, to some degree, \nto make sense of the overt behaviour of conspecifics in terms of their own experience. \nHumans are capable of empathy (see (Hatfield, Rapson & Le,  2009) for a review); and, on \nthe other hand, Homo sapiens has developed sophisticated innate signalling systems to \nexpress these emotions to conspecifics (Darwin, 1872), which all humans can decode (Eibl-\nEibesfeldt, 1967). Recent research suggests that humans and some other primates have \ninbuilt cognitive systems (\u2018mirror neurones\u2019) which enable them to feel the movements of \nother primates whom they see acting and to automatically infer the intentions behind these \nmovements (Gallese et al., 1996; Rizzolatti et al., 1996; Rizzolatti & Craighero, 2004; \nKeysers & Gazzola, 2006). These capacities facilitate learning in presence and by imitation. \nThey are powerful, but are somewhat limited by the fact those who share experience must be \nco-present during the event.  \nIt must be noted here that this sharing of experience is crucial in the constitution of \ngroups. In the short term, sharing experience (and especially emotions) is a strong \nconstituent of participation. In the long term, what builds a community is the sharing of \nexperience; and believing that this sharing is for the long term (hence the creation of a \ncommon mythical past and belief in a common destiny or project). Rituals are typically \nmoments where this phenomenon of participation is strong and can guide our intuition as to \nwhat kind of \u2018sharing\u2019 feeling humans enjoy. In sum, transmission of experience has a social \ndimension that goes beyond the mere transmission of information --- we shall come back to \nthis later in the section with the notion of obschenie. \nHowever, Homo Sapiens has gone one step further and developed a symbolic \nsystem of representations which, precisely, goes beyond this limitation of physical presence. \nLanguage, and more generally representation (re-presentation), enabled humans to transmit \nsome of the experience of objects, situations, intentions, etc., and the potential actions they \ncarry beyond the \u2018here and now\u2019 in the physical absence of the object. For example, the \nperson who has been in contact with \u2018a tiger\u2019 can describe, explain, teach what \u2018a tiger\u2019 is, \nand what should be done when one is met; all this in the comfortable absence of a tiger.  \nThis has a cost: representations are a projection of the original phenomenological \nexperience of the individual into a conventional, social, typifying, symbolic system; which is \nwhy we use here the term \u2018experience\u2019 and not \u2018knowledge\u2019 or \u2018information\u2019. The latter terms \nrefer to culturally processed products, which have gained in social intelligibility but have lost \nsome of the multidimensional aspects of primary, direct, bodily experience. \nRepresentations are pervasive in our lives because our societies hold, construct, and \nare continuously reconstructed by these representations (Berger & Luckmann, 1967; \nMoscovici, 1976). Representation systems carry their own affordances, which may open new \ncognitive possibilities, as (Goody, 1977) showed for writing and Wells (in preparation) shows \nfor literacy. But representations also carry biases: for example, the structure and vocabulary \nof a language may influence the way people experience the world (Whorf & Carroll, 1956).  \nTherefore, changes in our capacity to represent and transfer human experience will have \ndeep and pervasive consequences at the societal level. \nPrecisely, digitization has suddenly and massively increased our capacity to \nrepresent and transfer human experience by empowering us to represent new aspects which \n3 \nwere difficult to represent before (e.g. movements, space) and to provide new perspectives \n(e.g. bird\u2019s eye, first person, slow motion, acceleration, high magnification etc.); as well as by \ngreatly increasing the scope and speed of diffusion of such representations (through the \nInternet, etc.) while decreasing the marginal cost of such diffusion to almost zero. \nIn addition, digitization, because of the pervasiveness of networks and of the user-\nfriendly interfaces to the networks, now enables interactivity. Representations are \ncontinuously updated, amended, discussed, referred to in a collective-authorship process for \nwhich new instruments are growing: digital fora, wikis (Wikipedia being the most spectacular \nexample), social media, etc. Academia and professional training are now starting to put into \npractice these new tools, as was predicted; but the evolution is slow because these \ninstitutions must change models that took centuries to construct with the previous \ntechniques. \nIt is obvious that this change of representation systems will (and already has begun \nto) massively change our societies, as the printing press did in its time. It may be interesting \ntherefore to search for the fundamental drives that are at stake and which will orient the \nevolution of a technology that could virtually, in this domain, do anything. We forward here \nthe hypothesis that, because humans are social beings, we wish to share experience more \nthan we want to transmit knowledge. \nThis statement refers us back to two aspects of communication: content and sharing. \nThe distinction is not new: these aspects are explicitly separated in the Russian theory of \ncommunication: kommunikatsiya, which refers to the informational content --- content in the \nwestern tradition (Shannon & Weaver, 1949) --- and obschenie, which refers to the social, \nsharing aspects(Lomov, Belyaeva, et al.1985; Lomov, 1978, 1979; Nosulenko & Samoylenko \n1997). \nIndeed, this concept characterizes a specific area and sophisticated research in the Russian \npsychology. The term \u2018obschenie\u2019 incorporates several meanings of the term \u2018communication\u2019 as, for \nexample, \u2018Human Relations\u2019, \u2018interaction between individuals\u2019, \u2018pooling\u2019 and finally \u2018sharing\u2019 in the \nspiritual sense \u2026. In this perspective, communication is increasingly seen as not only a way to \n\u2018convey information\u2019, but also as social interaction and as a means of investigating the psychological \ncharacteristics of the other. (Nosulenko & Samoylenko 1998: 5)  \n \nSocial aspects of communication, and the role of experience sharing in group participation \nmentioned earlier are obvious in the way Internet chat and other \u2018social\u2019 media (Facebook, etc.) are \nused. Although there is a lot of information transmission, a large amount of the direct \n\u2018communication\u2019 is made of \u2018phatic\u2019 statements (Malinowski, 1923) and of sharing moods with \nvarious devices or emoticons. In social media, the main goals of obschenie statements seem to be to \nsignal that the individual is there, as a member of the group, and willing to share her\/his experience (\u2018I \nam doing this\u2019; \u2018I just did that\u2019; \u2018I am willing to display my experience\u2019). In fact, even mobile-phone \nconversations often start with some statement of where the speakers are, which is usually irrelevant to \nthe kommunikatsiya aspect of the conversation, but crucial for sharing experience.  \nAs we provide humans with very open affordances for communication, their actual behaviour \nand choices among all the possible combinations reveal to us what is really important for them: \nattending to the group; and this grounds our hypothesis. In digital mediated communication, as in real \n4 \nlife, the relation seems to be more important than the content. This does not mean that there is no \nkommunikatsiya in the social media, but it usually comes with obschenie. Furthermore, this is \nprecisely the reason for the success of the social media and their future business model as \n(social) sources of (commercial) information. Humans prefer to learn with someone rather \nthan from some document, as has been made clear by the success of training by peers over \nusing manuals in information technology. In fact, the preferred information is the one that \ncomes from \u2013and with- a \u2018good\u2019 group or source. \nThe interplay of kommunikatsiya and obschenie is complex because, more often than \nnot, being a good information provider (providing snappy answers in fora, having the good \nWeb links first) is a strategy to gain social status: in the end, the social motive takes over and \ninstruments all others. Here we see applied in the Web a theory that was worked out by \nDessalles for the development of conversation and the origin of language: displaying skills in \nmanaging information and transmitting experience to others is valued as a positive selective \ntrait for the skilful individual, since it signals him (her) as a good coalition partner (Dessalles, \n2007). \nDigital technologies are better at affording obschenie than conventional symbolic \ncommunication techniques because of their quick reaction time and interactivity, and this \nfeeds their growth. It is likely they will be used in the future for other aspects of experience \nsharing, to transfer more and more multimodal, intimate aspects of individual experience; \nand to build communities, at the same time as they grow as communication systems in the \nsense of kommunikatsiya. \nIn this context, this article will first introduce this special issue with a quick overview of \nthe papers, and how they fit in the problematic of the impact of digital technologies on the \ntransmission of knowledge; and then suggest a model for transferring human experiencen \nusing the affordances of these information technologies. \nSection 2 introduces the papers in this issue. Section 3 addresses the difficulties in \nthe transmission of human experience, due to its nature. Section 4 shows how digital \ntechnologies enable us to resolve some of these issues, but reminds us that these new \nsolutions also raise new issues. Section 5 proposes a new \u2018transition\u2019 model to structure the \ncapture and description of human experience using the affordances of these information \ntechnologies. \n \n2 Digitize and transfer \n \nThis issue of the Journal is taking a closer, grounded, look at how the process of capture and \ntransmission of human experience and knowledge will change with the advent of new digital \nmedia. \nThe core functional question of culture from an evolutionary perspective is: How can \nthe species foster the outcome of experiencing the world so that the next generation behaves \nmore efficiently? Trial and error was the biological way of natural selection: the fittest \nsurvived and reproduced (Darwin, 1859). Culture uses a dual selection process, where \nartefacts are selected by trial-and-error reality test (in society, on the market, etc.), while their \nrepresentations are selected by thought experiments and discussions, under institutional \n5 \nmonitoring and control (Lahlou, 2008a). Now, with the diffusion of digital technologies, \ninstitutions have started indeed reflecting on how to put to use these new affordances; they \nhave begun their social-monitoring process of these technologies. \nScience is exploring what these new media make it possible to transfer: see in this \nissue (Barabanschikov 2010), on the transmission of digitized faces, and Cordelois \n(Cordelois, 2010) on new ethnographic techniques. It also creates and tests new media, like \nMobltz, to make the best of the new affordances and create new types of multimedia \nnarratives (Lewis, Pea & Rosen, 2010). Smaller institutions concerned with production \ndevelop new solutions to capture and transfer their cognitive capital. Industrial corporations \nare interested in the transmission of professional know-how ( Le Bellu, Lahlou & Nosulenko, \n2010); while research centres and academia are trying to archive research data and results \n(Habert & Huc, 2010). Will new forms of narratives succeed in fulfilling the function that \nstories have always had in society (Garcia-Lorenzo, 2010)? The effect will certainly be \nglobal, but, at this point, it is unclear whether the result will be a liberation or a nightmare --- \nmaybe both --- since, as Ganascia points out, we can already see massive positive and \nnegative effects of what is clearly a change of societal paradigm caused by the digital \nprojection (Lahlou, 2008a) of all elements of the \u2018classic\u2019 world into its continuously updated \ndigital representation.  \n \n2.1 Framing uncertainty: Narratives, change and digital technologies. \n \nLucia Garcia-Lorenzo traces a broad cultural analysis of narratives, from developmental \naspects to organizational studies. While the roles of narratives in the transmission of \nknowledge has always been recognized, their role as instruments of community building, \nensuring permanence of the group, and of reassurance of its members in the face of \nuncertainty is less often described. Illustrations are taken from three empirical case studies in \nthe corporate world by Garcia-Lorenzo (the take-over of a national company by a \nmultinational corporation; a British-Swedish merger; and a virtual project team whose \nmembers are distributed around the globe).  \nReading Garcia-Lorenzo, it becomes clear that narratives are social-psychological \nprocesses, of which the manifest content (the story) is only one part, the activity of \nstorytelling being a crucial aspect. In moments of uncertainty, when the organization must \nfind psychological and social resources to face change, (re)creating and telling narratives \nprovides group members with resources to manage emotions constructively, link with the \npast and provide a framework for self-development. Garcia-Lorenzo shows with empirical \nillustrations how people create narratives to make sense of their world and especially by \nmaking boundaries.  \nShe also shows that the relation of storytelling with digitization is complex. On one \nhand, traditional storytelling is challenged, and new technologies produce a fragmentation \nand plurivocity in the organization. On the other hand, these technologies provide \naffordances for a new networking culture and new forms of circulation of stories. \n \n6 \n2.2 Beyond participation to co-creation of meaning: mobile social media in generative learning \ncommunities \n \nSarah Lewis, Roy Pea and Joseph Rosen describe a new system for sharing experience \nbetween individuals, with Mobltz, an amazing hybrid of blogs, social networks and video-\nstreaming. Beyond the technological revolution of enabling seamless mixes of text and video, \nMobltz is remarkable in its interface target: the mobile phone. This goes hand in hand with \nthe growing trend of being \u2018always on\u2019 and closely connected to the digital network by \nreporting actions and thoughts, and contributing to a collective construction online and on the \nfly. This system gives a preview of a future society where communication of experience with \nfellow humans is continuous and mediated by the Internet in a multimodal format that \nencompasses all senses. The authors\u2019 ambitious reflexion, grounded in activity theory, on \nnew modes of online presence and discussion sheds new light on the social-media hype. \nThe public sphere described by Habermas, at a time where language was the main vehicle \nfor discussion and when publication was a long and usually reflexive process, is now \nbecoming a multimedia arena where anyone can contribute at anytime with very low entry \nbarriers.  \n \n2.3 Capture and transfer the knowledge embodied in a professional gesture \n \nSophie Le Bellu, Saadi Lahlou and Valery Nosulenko present a systematic attempt to \ncapture and model professional gestures (here, in the context of operating machines in \npower plants), to transfer them from expert to novice. While they use the Subcam, as well as \nmore-classic recording equipment, it soon becomes clear that cooperation with the \nprofessionals who are filmed is a critical aspect of their technique, in order to capture the \ngoals and sub-goals as well as the local decision-making process. Their article, which \npresents the state of the art, while giving a clear and exciting vision of what is obviously the \nfuture of professional training, shows that we are far from having solved all the theoretical \nand technical difficulties of \u2018how to get there at low cost\u2019. It also points to a rising new \nparadigm of collaborative construction of knowledge, where the distinction between author, \nsubject, critic and user gets blurred. Indeed the construction, maintenance and use process \nof the new information tools seem to involve inputs from all the stake-holders in continuous \nwork in progress, in sharp contrast to the former \u2018book-publication\u2019 mode. \n \n2.4 Using digital technology for collective ethnographic observation: an experiment on \u2018coming \nhome\u2019 \n \nAntoine Cordelois describes a collective process where individuals are empowered to \ncollectively reflect on the action of one of them, by sharing the subjective view of his actions \nas recorded by the Subcam. While this is a first attempt, and is only used at this point for \nresearch purposes, one can think that such a process may generalize to other collective \nsituations: learning, training, but perhaps also trials, entertainment, decision-making support, \netc. While we usually tend to consider each technological innovation separately to evaluate \n7 \nits impacts, Cordelois\u2019 article provides food for thought by showing how the combination of \ntwo techniques (here: the subjective-recording with a Subcam, and collaborative online \nediting with Diver) can generate ground-breaking innovations in a classic process (here, the \nethnographic analysis).  \n \n2.5 What does the transmitted image of human face tell an observer about personality traits \n \nUsing the experimental techniques of psychology, Vladimir Barabanschikov studies what \nsubjects are able to infer from the psychological traits of other humans by looking at their \nphoto. Are the judgments based on photos correct? To ascertain this, he uses Cattel\u2019s scale \nof 16 personality factors (e.g. emotionality, reliability, self-reliance, etc.), and compares these \nassessments with the direct assessments of the photographed persons themselves \n(approximately 40% of the traits are estimated correctly; there are some differences in the \nresults based on gender, and also on the viewer\u2019s own personality). On that basis, which \ngives us an idea of the interpretation capacities of humans, we can now evaluate the impact \nof partial transmission.  \nWhen the face is partially masked, there is little difference in accuracy when the left- \nor right-hand sides of the face are showed alone; but when only the top part is showed, there \nis a marked decrease, and even more if only the lower part is shown. What this means for \nthe issue of digitization is that (a) what is perceived from an image is different from what the \nperson thinks of herself and also probably different from \u2018reality\u2019; (b) the capacity to transmit \naccurate information about the other\u2019s personality depends on the integrity of the medium. \nAlthough this may seem a \u2018half-full-glass\u2019 result, it does suggest that transmitting better \nimages will produce better understanding of the Other. \n \n2.6 Building together digital archives for research in social sciences and humanities \n \nBeno\u00eet Habert and Claude Huc describe a recent institutional attempt, by the French national \nresearch agency, to create a digital archive of a scientific domain. In this case, spoken data \n(which \u2018mainly consist in dialogs or monologs recorded for linguistics research\u2019) were used as \na pilot domain. In contrast with Garcia-Lorenzo\u2019s paper on narratives, this project, inspired by \nsimilar initiatives in physics, shows a computer-science approach to the issue of \ntransmission. The project explored how systematic digital conservation could be applied to \nthe field of social sciences and humanities, using a standard abstract model for archival \ninformation systems. \nThis article, which includes reflection on the nature of archiving and patrimonial \nstrategies, is especially valuable because it provides an insider view, having been written by \ntwo main leaders of the project --- it is exceptional that project leaders make the effort to \nreflect on their practice as builders of a new socio-technical system. The analysis shows how \ninstitutional and technical logics can influence process, and the importance of administration \nand project management, as attested by the number of acronyms representing institutions \nand systems involved. This contribution is interesting as an example of a deep reflexive \nexercise by the engineers of the new institutional digital system. It gives food for thought on \n8 \nhow to organize in the future such large conservation projects and how to involve the \nrelevant communities. \n \n2.7 The generalized \u2018sousveillance\u2019 society  \n \nJean-Gabriel Ganascia addresses one major consequence of the generalized transmission \nof experience through digital means, which he describes as the birth of a \u2018Catopticon\u2019, which \nmakes everybody capable of communicating with everybody. This new situation, introduced \nby the internet and the generalization of both surveillance and \u2018sousveillance\u2019 (where the \ncitizens themselves observe the system) by electronic means, contrasts with the previous \nsituation and the model of the Panopticon (where one powerful watchman could watch all the \ninmates at all times). Ganascia explores the consequences of this emerging paradigm in \nterms of power and democracy.  \nThis post-Foucaldian analysis is illustrated by a series of recent societal cases, and, \namong other seminal thoughts, shows how this Catopticon, on one hand, gives increased \npower and agency to single individuals (for example, a single individual can victoriously fight \na powerful corporation) and, simultaneously, captures them all in the pervasive control \nsystem of a net which never forgets. In describing the emergence of this new power entity, \nwhich is distributed, overwhelming and uncontrollable, Ganascia shows us that new issues \nare emerging, such as the desire for visibility in a world of information overload, the right of \naccess to information, the construction of cognitive authority and new rules for the political \ngame. \n \nAs we can see from these very diverse papers, new societal questions are emerging with the \nchanges introduced by these new technologies. Some of these questions would have not \nbeen imaginable twenty years ago, and this is a sign that a change of paradigm is taking \nplace, prompted by new techniques of capture and transfer, which are changing the contents \nand formats of relations between humans, which are the very fabric of our societies. \n \n3 Transmitting human experience \n \nHuman experience is difficult to capture and transmit because it is multimodal, embodied and \nsituated, passive and active; because sense making is subjective; because action is \ndistributed; because observation may modify behaviour. \n \nIf the hypothesis that we ventured in Section 1 (\u2018we wish to share experience more than we \nwant to transmit knowledge\u2019) is correct, the future will see an increased demand, and offer, to \nshare human experience by means of digital technologies. \nIn this context, there arise the questions of what exactly is human experience and \nhow it can best be transmitted. Progress on these questions may help individuals capture \nand transmit their own experience. It may also help systems designers, industry, policy \nmakers and (let\u2019s face it) business. It is precisely for this last reason that we should be aware \nof what is intimate and must be preserved in this transmission, and as soon as possible set \n9 \nsome ethical principles before a technological fait accompli presents us with almost \nirreversible situations (cf. Facebook and its privatisation of personal data of millions of youth \nwho wanted to share their experience). \n\u2018What is human experience?\u2019 This is a difficult question if it is not asked with a specific \npurpose. We decided to leave aside the difficult philosophical issues of phenomenology and \nrelativism, to cautiously ignore post-modernist critical stance and to avoid getting into \ndetailed ethnomethodological discussions. Our approach will instead be to explore how we \ncan share this human experience in practice. In doing so, we will venture an imperfect model, \nwhich owes a lot to activity theory, distributed cognition and functionalist perspectives in \nanthropology; a model which we hope will fuel a constructive discussion among theorists and \npractitioners.  \nLet us start by examining some characteristics of human experience and how these \nimpact the issue of capture and transmission. \n \n3.1 Human experience is multimodal and situated \n \nHuman experience is multimodal because we exist on several levels simultaneously. The \nmost obvious factor of multimodality is the diversity of our sensory organs: we see, hear, \ntaste, smell, touch and act. In fact, talking about five senses is a strong reduction. \nKinaesthesia involves all muscles. We see, hear, and smell in stereo. Taste involves several \nreceptor systems. A more detailed analysis shows that we are constantly aware, at some \nlevel, of a considerable array of variables, from temperature to muscle tension and hormone \nlevels. And of course, we have a mental and emotional life. All these parameters participate \nin our experience of the life-world; they contribute to explain why we behave as we do and \nhow we make sense of situations. And these different types of input are irretrievably \nintegrated into one single multimodal experience in the mind: mono-modal aspects cannot \nbe, even at the neurone level, separated from this holistic experience. This is why, for \nexample, a white wine coloured with a red (and otherwise neutral and tasteless) colouring \nwill \u2018taste\u2019 like a red wine (Brochet, 2000). \nBecause perceptions are embodied, experience is situated: we live it from our point of \nview in space and time and in our lived body. Only recently (Suchman, 1987) has science \nrealized the implications for our cognition of the fact that we must in practice, continuously \nreact on the fly, as we are carried along by the flow of events; in contrast to the distantiated \nand un-involved theoretical perspective. If we want to understand experience, we must seize \nit \u2018in the wild\u2019 (Hutchins, 1995a), in the flow of life, and not by a mere account ex-post facto, \nwhich, as we know, is a reconstruction, as are theories based on introspection alone. It is the \ndifference between practice and theory.  \nThis calls for a capture of experience in situ: from the perspective of the actor, in its \nvery body. This is easier said than done. For example, as we discovered through experiment, \nfilming from the exact perspective of the retina produces a different effect than from, e.g. a \ncamera attached to the forehead. The latter provides the perspective of someone slightly \ntaller, and does not match with the subject\u2019s own perception. Alignments and occlusions are \n10 \nnot rendered correctly, neither is eye contact; and the respective height of subjects, which is \nan important factor in interpersonal relations, is lost. \nAnd of course, situated means both in place and time. This means that experience \nmust be recorded as it emerges on the fly. As a consequence, the decision to wear a capture \ndevice must be made in advance of the event to be observed. \n \n3.2 Human experience is both passion and action \n \nStrangely enough, philosophy has focused mainly on experience as a passion with the \ndescription of perception and emotions; but its motor aspect (action) is just as important. \nFirst, even perception is an activity because it results from an exploratory action with the \nsensory organs ( Gibson, 1963; Leont'ev, 1976; Lenay, 2008). Attention is the behaviour by \nwhich we orient our sensory systems to the environment; in doing so, we select some \nspecific aspects and scotomize the rest. Many psychological experiments on the \u2018priming\u2019 \neffect, where the attention of the subject is selectively tuned to some aspects by providing \nher some cues prior to the stimuli, show how powerful this selection is. One can be in a \nsituation and remain completely unaware of the aspects to which one is not \u2018paying \nattention\u2019. This phenomenon, called \u2018inattentional blindness\u2019 (Mack & Rock, 1988), has led to \nmany a spectacular experiment of which the most famous is probably the \u2018gorilla\u2019 experiment \n(Simons & Chabris, 1999), in which subjects are shown a video of two basketball teams (one \ndressed in black, the other in white) and asked to count the number of times the white team \npasses the ball. In the middle of the film, a man dressed in a black gorilla suit slowly passes \nthrough the group and waves at the camera; but half of the subjects do not notice this when \nthey see the film. When watching a second time after being warned about the gorilla, they all \nnotice it and can hardly believe it is the same film they already saw. \nWhile the orientation of sensing in a specific direction is fairly easy to render with \nmechanical sensors (e.g. directional microphones), it is less easy to render the interpretive \nselection mechanism operated by the mind on the raw data (e.g. the capacity to tune in to a \nspecific conversation in the noisy environment of a cocktail party). The only access we can \nhave at this point seems to be to ask the subjects what their interpretations were.  \n \n3.3 Sense making \n \nThere is no perception per se, we always perceive \u2018something\u2019, that is, an object. What we \nexperience are objects, intentions, situations, and not a series of perceptions. Therefore, \nsimply capturing a flow of physical parameters will not be appropriate; we must capture the \nmeaning of the experience. And to be understood, this meaning must find anchoring \n(Moscovici, 1961) in the representations of the receiver. Therefore, in this case more than \never, we should apply the postulate of adequacy: \n \nPostulate of adequacy. It may be formulated as follows: each term used in a \nscientific system referring to human action must be so constructed that a human act \nperformed within the life-world by an individual actor in the way indicated by the \n11 \ntypical construction would be reasonable and understandable himself as well as for \nhis fellow man. (Sch\u00fctz, 1976: 19) \n \n3.4 Action is distributed \n \nHuman action is distributed. For example, in a scene happening in a restaurant, many local \nactions are relevant: what happens at the tables, but also what the waiters are doing in the \ndining room, what they are doing backstage, and what the cooks are doing because all these \nare connected in a functional chain. And indeed each stake-holder to some extent takes into \naccount what the others are doing in order to act properly. Therefore, a full explanation for \nthe sake of education or transmission should provide the whole picture, and the way to \nconstruct the whole picture in a methodical and systematic way is the job of the scientist, \nwho should not only rely on what his informers tell him.  \n \nWe would certainly be surprised if we found a cartographer in mapping a town \nrestricting himself to collecting information from the natives. Nevertheless, social \nscientists frequently choose this strange method. They forget that their scientific work \nis done on a level of representation and understanding different from the people in \ndaily life. (Sch\u00fctz, 1942: 67) \n \nA representation of the whole situation, as the state of things and beings that \nsurround us, is necessary to understand what was at stake in the experience that is being \ntransmitted. While Sch\u00fctz (Sch\u00fctz, 1942) is quite right that the scientist should not limit \nherself to what the subject says, this part is still essential to understand what is at stake, and \nwhat are the values of the stakes; and in fact later in the same paper, Sch\u00fctz writes, \ncommenting on the example of a businessman who runs to catch the same train he takes \nevery morning, in order, this specific day, not to loose an important contract: \u2018Let us assume \nthat an observer watches this man rushing for the train \u201cas usual\u201d (so he thinks). Is this \nbehaviour planned, and if so, what is the plan? Only the actor can give the answer because \nhe alone knows the span of his plans and projects\u2019 (ibid.: 76). \nIndeed the actual components of the activity may not be obvious for an external \nobserver. Sometimes the operator will use a proxy to evaluate the situation of an invisible \nelement, e.g. the wheels of a vehicle: in the Pantanal (a wetland region in Mato Grosso) our \nguide Douglas Trent, as he drove his Volkswagen minibus over approximate bridges made of \na couple of raw tree trunks, used to say (once the bridge was crossed) with the smile of the \nsuccessful expert: \u2018It\u2019s good to know where your wheels are!\u2019 How could we transfer his \nactual experience of crossing a bridge without accessing his internal representation of the \nsituation and how risky he felt it was, knowing what he knew about bridges, wheels, \nminibuses, crocodiles and piranhas? \nThis is why the description may need to go beyond a mere film of what a given \nsubject \u2018sees\u2019. As we said, the subject\u2019s attention focuses on specific aspects of the situation. \nBut this does not preclude the subject\u2019s taking into account other aspects of the situation. \nThe aircraft pilot is aware of the position of the undercarriage; the train driver is aware of his \n12 \npassengers --- even though he does not see them; and in fact these are important elements \nin their decisions. \nWe believe that this context as viewed by the subject should be described in a \u2018naive \nrealistic\u2019 manner. First, even if every experience is subjective and situated, common sense \nassumes realism: the subject believes that the context is \u2018out there\u2019. Therefore, for the sake \nof communication in practice, we shall do \u2018as if\u2019 it was indeed \u2018out there\u2019, and provide an \n\u2018objective\u2019 description of the scene, sticking to common sense..  This is not always satisfying \nin theory, but is handy in practice. [2]. \n \n3.5 Observation may modify behaviour \n \nIf the subject is aware of being observed, observation may modify the behaviour. This is \nespecially obvious when the observer is present in situations where private interactions take \nplace. \nWhen observed, subjects tend to stick to the rules of the group. In fact, what matters \nis less the presence of the observer herself than the group she represents. This is why it is \nstill possible to get good observations when the subject is promised confidentiality (\u2018only the \nobserver will know\u2019). If the subject does not fear being seen misbehaving by the members of \nhis in-group (e.g. the viewers are from another group; or the subject thinks his behaviour is \nacceptable, or has a status such that it does not matter, etc.), then the effect of observation \nis minor. \nThere are also possible implications of the fact that the subject knows that his \nbehaviour will be traced by automatic instruments. Nosulenko, Pavard, Rognin, & \nSamoylenko (1993) provide an interesting example of such a case, in which operators in a \nspace-mission control centre had to go away from the official \u2013and traced- communication \nsystem to solve a problem in an unconventional manner, and then denied having done so.  \nFinally, as observation is also the result of attentional focus, the way the recording is \ndone by the observer may modify the representation of behaviour. Depending on the camera \nangle or when the film starts, interpretation can be completely reversed. For example, during \nour conversations about activity recording with British police, one stated that one time his \nattempt to help a very agitated drunk person was mistaken for an aggression, based on a \nvideo-tape made by a witness; hence he was put into serious trouble. Fortunately a video-\ncamera on a pole had captured the whole scene from the beginning and from another angle, \nwhich enabled him to prove that the witness\u2019s interpretation was wrong, and saved the \npoliceman\u2019s day. \nMore generally, observers from outside the community tend to have an ignorance \nbias and fail to capture elements that are critical to understanding the situation, while inside \nobservers tend to ignore element that are inconsistent with the image they want to have of \ntheir community (Cicourel & Lahlou, 2005). \n \nAs we see, human experience is a complex phenomenon to capture, and to transfer. There \nare still more issues in capturing and transferring human experience: some crucial elements \n13 \nare tacit, holographic (distributed in communities) and transient: Garcia-Lorenzo addresses \nsome of these problems in her paper in this issue. \nNevertheless, even if it seems very difficult to capture and transfer human experience \nin theory, we manage to do it in practice on an everyday basis. And digitization will now \nenable us to solve some of these issues and make the process easier, as we shall see in the \nnext section. \n \n4 Digital technologies, capture and transmission \n \nDigital technologies, and especially digital video, have already brought considerable changes \nin the social sciences. The use of image had brought a first revolution in qualitative research \nby providing a whole set of new investigation techniques (Bauer & Gaskell, 2000). The \ntechnological progress of digital video, streaming, automatic indexing, online editing and \nanalysis, and computer-supported collaborative work have taken it a step further (Pea,1994, \nPea 2006; Cordelois, 2010). \nDigital ethnography enables both better study of \u2018classic\u2019 interaction and study of IT-\naugmented environments (Hollan & Hutchins, 2009). This is welcome, since, because of the \n\u2018digital projection\u2019 (Lahlou, 2008a) of activity, many of the new interactions are happening in \ndigital space (e.g. on the computer screen), where classic observation systems could hardly \nfollow. As we said earlier, digitization brings new affordances and relaxes some constraints. \n \n4.1 Digitization relaxes some constraints \n \nAs Pink points out:  \n \nRecently, uses of video in ethnographic research have developed in tandem \nwith new technologies, innovations and theoretical perspectives. Shifts from a realist \napproach to video as \u2018objective\u2019 reality to the idea of video as representation shaped \nby specific standpoints of its producers and viewers have encouraged the \ndevelopment of collaborative approaches to the production and interpretation of video \nimages. The introduction of digital video and computer-based techniques seems \nparticularly appropriate for the development of these methods and is forming the \nbasis of future development in video research. (Pink, 2007: 116) \n \nSituated and multimodal capture has now become possible. Wearable sensors can \ncapture most of the biological parameters of the human body. Unfortunately, for most of them \nthe replay does not re-present the experience adequately: seeing electric signals of blood \npressure or brain scans does not enable us to re-live something of the experience. This is a \nproblem of representation format. But at least for image and sound, and also to some degree \nfor haptics and smell, we have found ways of re-presenting the experience: when we see \nfilms, they make sense and we can understand the situation. This is a direction for research, \nand some amazing results lead us to expect future progress in multimodality replay, since \nsubjects can learn to use other neural pathways to the brain for the input of sensory \n14 \ninformation (Bach-y-Rita et al., 2005). But at least for the time being, we can rely on video-\ncameras and audio.  \nEspecially interesting is the possibility of getting a \u2018subjective\u2019 recording of activity. To \nunderstand the nature of situated cognition and activity, Lahlou set up in 1998 a method to \ncapture a situated first-person audio-visual recording (\u2018subfilm\u2019), using the Subcam --- a \nminiature video-camera with wide-angle worn at eye level --- and the interpretation by the \nsubject itself of the films (especially the goals and emotions), obtained by asking the subject \nto comment their own subfilms (Lahlou 2006, 2009; Le Bellu, Lahlou & Le Blanc, 2009). \n \n \nFigure 1 : A frame extracted from a subfilm (filmed with a Subcam)  \n \nUnobtrusive, wearable sensors. Using wearables, as the subject becomes her\/his \nown observer, partly solves the problem of modification of behaviour by the observation. The \nsubject feels like an observer as well as an \u2018observed\u2019. This seems to make the subject feel \nmore in control of her data, especially if, as we do in our protocols (Lahlou, 2006), the subject \nsees the data first and only hands them over to the researcher if (s)he is satisfied with their \ncontent. \nA subject recording her\/his own experience with the Subcam is called a \u2018subcamer\u2019. \nThe resulting \u2018subfilms\u2019 can be used for research, and be shown to others, enabling them to \nshare the subjective experience of the subcamer as passengers in her\/his head (Figure 1). \nBecause the Subcam has a wide angle, it captures not only what the subject sees but also \nwhat s(he) does, at least with the hands; and what s(he) hears and says. We therefore \ncapture a good view of the action itself, from a first-person perspective, with the correct eye--\n15 \nhand synchronisation. Since the subject tends systematically to look at what (s)he is doing, \nthe Subcam enables us, and this is not trivial, to capture the focus of attention.  \nInterestingly, as viewers are taken into the perception--action loop of the subcamer \n(\u2018entheasy\u2019: sharing the contemplation of action), an identification process emerges and \nempathy occurs, based on sharing similar phenomenological experience. Although we do not \nget a fully multimodal recording, because experience is united in a single bundle, it seems \nthat the elements recorded on tape are enough to elicit in the viewer an experience similar to \nthe subject\u2019s. To what degree this is deceptive is difficult to know: in theory, this facilitated \nreconstruction effect is a double-edged sword, since my reconstructed experience of e.g. \ndriving a car or eating macaroni will be phenomenologically different from yours, as they are \nthe result of each of our total life-experiences. Once again, theory and practice diverge here. \nExperience shows that entheasy is quite different from empathy. As viewers, we precisely \nfeel the small differences in the way the subcamer does things \u2018differently\u2019. In fact, we get a \nfeeling of detachment even when watching our own tapes. The result is an awareness of \nwhat the subcamer is doing (because we identify immediately the typified situations, and \ncorrectly infer typified goals), but there is still a feeling of strangeness. More research on this \nphenomenon is needed. \nMoreover, confronted with their own subfilms, subcamers themselves show a \nremarkable capacity for remembering their actual mental states during activity (emotions, \ngoals) (Lahlou, 2006). As they are re-immersed in the past episode with the same \nperspective from which they lived it, they gain direct access to their \u2018episodic memory\u2019 \n(Tulving, 1972, 2002). This is one of the most important features of our subjective recording \nmethodology because it yields access to the cognitive aspects of activity. \nThe fact that reviewing images of the day is a powerful memory aid has been used by \nSteve Hodge and his colleagues: their SenseCam (Hodges et al., 2006) helps Alzheimer \npatients to remember their day and share memories with their partner.  \nAnother line of development of wearables, pioneered by Steve Mann, is the \ncontinuous recording of one\u2019s own history with wearable cameras, to \u2018help us remember and \nsee better, provide us with personal safety through crime reduction, and facilitate new forms \nof communication through collective connected humanistic intelligence\u2019 (Mann, 1998). This \nhas also led to a democratic project to combat surveillance by keeping records of one\u2019s own \nperspective and therefore being able to oppose this individual perspective to the surveillance \nrecordings: Mann coined the term \u2018sousveillance\u2019 for this inverse form of surveillance (Mann, \n2004).  \nSensors in the context, for example passive sensors at doors, access log-ins, and \nmore generally any system keeping a trace of the subject\u2019s activity, as in the \u2018disappearing \ncomputing\u2019 systems which will be embedded in most home and office automation systems \n(Streitz et al., 2007), can contribute to creating a \u2018lifelog\u2019 that is a continuous trace of what \nthe subject does (Gemmell et al., 2002). On one hand, this answers the issue of distributed \nactivity (Section 0). But on the other hand, lifelogging, because it can be done without the \nobserved subject\u2019s awareness, can cause massive privacy problems (Lahlou, 2008b).  \nIn sum, wearables and distributed sensors provide silent, unobtrusive and continuous \nobservation. Situated recordings enable explicitation of the mental states accompanying \n16 \nactivity by using self-confrontation of the subjects with the data. These techniques are \nemployed by other authors in this issue (Le Bellu, Lahlou et Le Blanc, 2009; Cordelois, \n2010). Unless they are used with the informed consent of the subjects, however, such \ntechniques carry risks for privacy and freedom of action. Nevertheless, the Subcam and \nsimilar techniques of subjective recording open unprecedented access to human experience \nand insight into mental states. Not only can we get a realistic visual and auditory account of \nthe situated individual experience of the Other, but also we can get detailed comments \u2018from \nthe horse\u2019s mouth\u2019 on how this Other interpreted the events, what emotions were felt and \nwhat were the intentions behind the actions. The SHEOS project underway at the Institute of \nSocial Psychology at the London School of Economics and Political Science is a global \nattempt to use these techniques to constitute a historical compendium of human experience \nfor research purposes (SHEOS, 2010). \nAs such systematic transmission projects grow, it will become necessary to formulate \nsome guidelines for the formats in which to capture human experience. \n \n 5 A new model for the description of human experience: \u2018transition\u2019 trajectories. \n \nIn the present issue, Lucia Garcia-Lorenzo gives an account of the history of stories and how \nthey can be used in practice. Stories (or narratives) have always been a privileged mode of \ntransmission of human experience. And this may be why all humans like stories, from their \nyoungest age.  \nBut why are narratives a privileged form of transmission of experience? Because from \nthe perspective of the subject, the World appears continuously in the form of a \u2018story\u2019 of \nwhich the subject is the hero, in which the (s)he moves, acts, and meets objects and \ncharacters. This story is necessarily experienced in the form of temporal succession, and is \nfocused on the conduct of the course of a single hero (the subject,) who imposes his vantage \npoint. In other words, narration is not a specific mode of description, it is the archetypal mode \nof a subject\u2019s experience of the world. We tend to identify with the hero of the story because \nin our real-life story we are always the hero. \nThe narrative categories of temporal succession, places, scenes, characters, etc. \ncorrespond to the naive categories that the common man uses to describe the states of \nthings in his subjective experience. It is not surprising that the theatrical metaphor used by \nGoffman works so well for describing everyday life (Goffman, 1959): the very narrative \nstructure of drama is based on the categories by which humans make sense of their life. \nNarratives are very powerful because they typify the story. The use of language, \nwhich is \u2018the medium of typification par excellence\u2019 (Sch\u00fctz, 1951), ensures that listeners will \nbe able to interpret what the narrative is about. When we say \u2018Albert sat on a chair and took \nhis hammer\u2019; the words \u2018chair\u2019, \u2018hammer\u2019, as well as the use of the verb \u2018to sit\u2019, refer to \ntypified elements of activity that we can readily understand. Whereas getting, for example, \nAlbert\u2019s brain electric signals, as captured by brain electrodes, would mean nothing to us. In \nother words, the narrative applies Sch\u00fctz\u2019s postulate of adequacy (cf. above, 3.3). \nThe classic narrative created a \u2019narrative world\u2019 (Eco, 1979), made of typifications \n(objects, characters, props, etc.), where the hero would progress in a succession of actions \n17 \nand solve problems within the framework of this narrative world in accordance with his \nmotives. Therefore we, as spectators, would understand what happened by identifying with \nthe hero. \nClassic narratives were a great solution when direct, situated, subjective recording of \nexperience was not available. Now that we have this new possibility, can we imagine a better \nformat for the transfer of experience? This is what the following section attempts to do. \n \n5.1 A systemic description of activity \n \nHuman experience is about experience of activity, so we need to describe activity. Activity is about \ntransition between successive states of the life-world. \nDynamical-systems formalism is relevant for our problem because it provides a clean \ndescription of successive states of complex  system. A dynamical system is a model to describe the \nevolution over time of a set of interacting objects, with the following conventions (Katok & \nHasselblatt 1996; Dauc\u00e9 2010):  \n--- A representation of state, which is, for each state of the system, the list of the m values of \nvariables describing this given state. The space of all possible states is a manifold M of dimension m, \ncalled \u2018phase space\u2019. One specific state is represented as a point x = (a1, a2, \u2026 am) of this space.  \n--- A transition function F, which defines the state of the system at a given moment of time, \nfrom its states in the previous times. If the system is initially at a state x, it will find itself after time t \nat a new state F(x, t). This function verifies: F(x, 0) = x and F(F(x, t1), t2) = F(x, t1 + t2). \nThe transition function can therefore describe the trajectory of the system in the phase space.  \nMore precisely, the trajectory that has x0 for origin (x0 describes the initial conditions) will be \ndefined by the application \nFx0: T \uf0e0 M such that Fx0(t) = F(x0 , t).  \nThis associates a specific state of the system with each point in time. This function can be \nrepresented by a curve in the phase space, the trajectory formed by the points representing the \nsuccessive state of the system, F(x0 , t) as t varies. \nThese \u2018states\u2019 are constituents of activity in activity theory. A \u2018represented final state of the \nsystem\u2019 is a \u2018goal\u2019. At any moment, the state of the system is \u2018the conditions given\u2019, which are the \ncontext in which the subject will try to achieve the goal. Therefore, trajectories in a phase space would \nmap the actions (transition from one step to the next) or, rather, the results of actions as a modification \nof the state of the environment (external and internal). \nIn theory, a dynamical system is a very generic formalism that could describe any \ncomplex system, including the ones in which human experience takes place. In practice, in \nthe current state of the art, we are only able to describe rather simple and limited systems of \nthe real world, with a restricted number of variables (usually a few hundreds at most) \nconnected by relatively straightforward relations (e.g. positive or negative feedback, etc.). \nThis is too limited to describe the behaviour of an individual human in an open environment. \nNevertheless, the basic principles of representation of dynamical systems can be used \nmetaphorically to explain the subjects that an activity can be considered as \u201ca trajectory in a \nstate space\u201d, and therefore provide them with some guidelines as how to describe it. The \ninterest of such an approach is that we ask the subject to describe his activity not simply as a \n18 \nsequence of his own actions and decisions but as the sequence of successive situations \nexperienced in the course of activity. This elicits descriptions that can be used by others to \ndiagnose the situations and interpret them in terms of what can\/should be done: their activity \nconnotations (Von Uexk\u00fcll, 1965). This is part of a functionalist approach to the transfer of \nhuman experience. Furthermore, such descriptions of situations facilitate the cognitive \nprocess of comparison (of situations). The cognitive mechanism of comparison is at the basis \nof the perceived-quality method (Nosulenko & Samoylenko, 2009) used to design operational \nchanges based on user experience. \nPut simply, without the mathematical apparatus: in a dynamical system, a state of the \nsystem is represented by a point in the mathematical space of all possible states; therefore \nan activity can be represented by a trajectory in this space. The trajectory starts with the \ninitial situation. The subject in the initial situation has a goal, which is to find herself in \nanother situation, hopefully the final state of the trajectory. Some points are intermediate \ngoals, which the subjects anticipate as action steps in their activity trajectory.  \nOnce this is understood, the subject should be able to describe the activity as \nanticipated (\u2018thinking in the future perfect tense\u2019, to use Sch\u00fctz\u2019s expression), even before \nstarting it. Since a goal is \u2018a conscious description of this state to be reached\u2019, the subject is \nusually able to describe it, as well as the intermediate goals that are reached by action steps. \nFor example, if the initial situation is realizing that one has a flat tire while driving, a \nfirst action step might be to find a safe place to stop (sub-goal: \u2018park in a safe place\u2019). Then \nanother step will be to take off the wheel with the flat tire; another one to put on the spare \nwheel; another to get the flat tire repaired; etc. \nSubjects will usually understand rather easily this idea of behavioural trajectory. \nWhen asked to describe their own trajectory and the \u2018action steps\u2019 they take, the idea of a \ntrajectory will help them make their goals and decision points explicit (although they may \ntend to overemphasize the spatial aspect because of the trajectory metaphor).  \nSubjects can also be asked to describe the alternative trajectories that may be \nconsidered at decision steps. For example, once safely parked, the subject may consider \nchanging the tire herself, call the insurance to send someone to do it or use instant tire \nsealant.  \nWhen the whole activity is developed, the result is some sort of tree of possible \ntrajectories. It must be made quite clear that this tree does not necessarily exist ex ante; it \ndevelops as the subject progresses in the activity, and the alternatives, as well as their \ncharacteristics, unfold from what the subject finds in the situation itself. Experience shows \nthat what happens is that the subject tends to follow routines, and only when the routine does \nnot work as expected is the subject\u2019s awareness awakened and directed at the problem. In \nthese moments, the subject tries to make sense of the situation, and the goal is often to find \nan alternative path to reach the initial goal. Figure 2 shows an example with the \u201cflat tire\u201d, \nwhere a subject describes his story as a series of successive state (we took an example \nwithout video to make the discussion shorter).  \n \n19 \nA \u2013 Driving normally on the highway  \nB \u2013 Strange vibration in the steering wheel, car unstable, noise. Awareness that \nsomething is wrong.  \nB1. Hypothesis : road is damaged : visibly no  \nB2 Hypothesis : car is damaged (flat tire?) [alternative chosen]  \nC- Decision :  \nC1. continue driving (dangerous?)  \nC2. Stop immediately (dangerous if no parking space)  \nC3.

Call insurance to send mechanic to change tire (unknown delay and cost)  \nE3. Fix tire with instant sealant (easy, fast, but damages tire and only transient \nsolution) [alternative chosen\/ done].  \nF. Drive slowly for 10 miles  \nG. Get to initial destination, but note that soon must go to garage to fix tire  \nFigure 2. The flat tire. Example of an activity trajectory described by steps, as a tree \nof possibilities (first and second level of branches only detailed).  \n \nSome of these trajectories lead into hazardous or unpleasant state zones, which the \nsubject may be able to describe as state areas to avoid. For example, changing a tire on the \nside of a highway when the tire to be changed is on the highway side is a dangerous state \narea to be in. \nThe subject then can be asked to describe each sub-goal state as \u2018a situation\u2019, as if \nthe subject \u2018was there\u2019 and was looking \u2018around and inside herself 360\u00b0\u2019 to describe the state \nof the various objects, and what affordances or risk may exist at this point. This is a \nsubjective interpretation of the situation.  \n\u201cThis world, built around my own I, presents itself for interpretation to me, being living \nna\u00efvely within it. From this standpoint everything has reference to my actual historical \nsituation, or as we can also say, to my pragmatic interests which belong to the situation in \nwhich I find myself here and now\u201d (Sch\u00fctz, [1954], 1962 p. 134)  \nFor example, in our \u2018flat tire\u2019 scenario, the situation when one is changing the tire on \nthe road-side, with the cars passing just behind one, is indeed very uncomfortable. The 360\u00b0 \ndescription of the situation will include both the aspects of the context (wearing the \u2018high viz\u2019 \nbright reflective jacket, park as far as possible off the road, etc.) and the internal goals (e.g. \ndo things fast but methodically because the worst is to have to start over again; ask the \nchildren to leave the car and sit in a safe place, don\u2019t let the bolts roll under the car or onto \nthe road etc.); but also the emotions (fear, frustration, determination etc.). \nThis technique of transmission of human experience, of course, can be applied purely \nverbally, as just shown, but we propose to use it in conjunction with a subjective recording \nmethodology, like the Subcam protocol, in order to gather the cognitive elements needed to \n20 \nunderstand the activity. The first step is to ask the subject to describe the activity, without \nlooking at the film (step 1 below). This will train the subject to pay introspective attention to \naction steps and goals, and produce a tree of activity as in Figure 2.  \nStep 2 is to look at the film with the subject, and ask him to \u2018pause\u2019 the film [1] each \ntime he wants to comment, and then to describe the elements of activity (objects, people, \ngoals, feelings\u2026) with the 360\u00b0 exercise. This produces a series of commented clips, like the \nones described by (Cordelois, 2010) or (Le Bellu et al., 2010). The format depends on the \nvideo software used. Figure 3 shows an extract of such analysis on a subfilm of a driver \nentering an underground parking lot, using the Diver software (Pea 2006). In this analysis, \nonly the trajectory of the succession of the actual situations is shown, since the possible \nalternatives that were not chosen, of course, did not materialize.  \n \n \nFigure 3: Example of analysis taken from step 2 using the Diver software  \n \nComparison between the two steps, which will often be spontaneously done by the \nsubject, is revealing of many important details or process. Here is an example of how to \nintroduce verbally the subject to the exercise. \n \nPhase 1: verbal description without self-confrontation with the film \nI will ask you to describe your activity as a journey through different phases, just as \nyou would describe a trajectory on a map. Think of the initial point as the situation where you \nstart from, and as the end point of a situation at which you want to arrive (your goal).  \nWe speak in terms of changes of situation; this does not mean that you move in \ngeographical space, but rather in the space of situations. Can you describe the situation you \nwant to reach --- your goal? To describe it, imagine yourself there: look around and inside \nyourself 360\u00b0, and describe what there is (what should be there). \nCan you do the same for the situation you started from? \nNow let us consider your journey step by step. What are the important action steps \nand the intermediate states you want to reach?  \n21 \nFor each of them, explain if this is a decision-making point and what the alternatives \nare.  \n \nPhase 2: verbal comment of the film during self-confrontation \nPlease comment on the video as it plays; do not hesitate to pause when you wish to \ngive a detailed explanation. Please also pause at each important step or decision-making \nmoment to explain what your thoughts were at that moment and what were the important \naspects in the situation. Use with the 360\u00b0 look-around-and-inside method. \nIt is very important that these exchanges have some obschenie aspect: the subject \nshould have a clear social motivation for explicating his activity and experience. If the subject \nis providing his description for a group he likes, then sharing will be a pleasure. The \ninterviewer should therefore in some way represent or impersonate a community of liked \nrecipients.  \nWhen the dynamical-system approach can be used more fully to draw some phase \nspace this can provide great insight. It is difficult to get more than very crude 2-dimensional \nmaps of such phase spaces, but even these can prove useful for exploring the psychological \nexperience and the rationale of decision-making. Figure 4 shows such a crude 2-dimensional \nmap, resulting from a discussion and several scribble attempts at drafting the domains the \nsubject tried to avoid during the flat-tire experience described in Figure 2 (see explanation \nbelow). Note that this phase space did not exist as a mental representation before the \nexplicitation exercise, and is instead a result of it. Still, it is interesting, and the subject can \ncomment on some of its dimensions, e.g. here the fact that on the left side the \u2018upset\u2019 feeling \ngrows, while to the right the \u2018scared\u2019 feeling grows; and that the \u2018lower\u2019 zones are more \nstressful than the \u2018upper\u2019 ones. Such maps can be used to position other events (e.g. here: \u2018a \ncollision\u2019 in the BIG DANGER zone; \u2018a major mechanical breakdown\u2019, like the gear box, in \nthe BIG HASSLE zone). It can also help subjects verbalize their feelings. Interestingly, the \nfeelings can be attributed to the whole situation, and not to the subject\u2019s own body. For \nexample, in case of mechanical damage to their car (with no human physically harmed), \nsome subjects still express the idea that it (the damage to the car) hurts them in their own \nbody. \n \n22 \nFigure 4: A crude phase space constructed around the \u2018flat tire\u2019 experience. The trajectory of \nexperience (fat curve) and its steps refer back to the indexing of steps in Figure 2. \n \nThe phase space distinguishes the normal state of driving without incident, which is \nthe staring state (ALL OK), step A.  \nThen, with the awareness of a strange noise and vibration, the subject reaches a \nzone of NOT OK. This is where step B (strange vibration in the steering wheel, car unstable, \nnoise. Awareness that something is wrong) occurs.  \nThen the subject moves on to step C, which is a decision-making point (continue \ndriving fast\/ Stop immediately\/ Slow down and park as soon as safe place is available). The \nfirst two options would lead into a HIGH DANGER zone, and the subject chooses the third \n(slow down until safe parking available), which moves the situation into a SMALL DANGER \nzone. Step D (slow down and stop in rest area) is on the border between SMALL DANGER \nand a new zone, SMALL HASSLE.  \nAs the subject goes around the car and diagnoses the flat tire, he moves to E, which \nis a decision step (between E1. Fix tire with spare \/ E2. Call insurance to send mechanic to \nchange tire \/ E3. Fix tire with instant sealant). \nE is on the border between SMALL HASSLE and BIG HASSLE, because E1 is a big \nhassle (dirty, effortful and delaying); E3 is a small hassle (easy, fast, but damages tire and \nonly transient solution), and E2 is borderline because the consequences are unknown (small \nor big hassle?). \n23 \nAs subject chooses E3, fixes the tire and restarts driving (slowlyat first  to let the \nsealant dry evenly) he transits slowly through the SMALL HASSLE zone and finally, as he \nresumes driving at normal speed, goes back into the NOT OK zone, where something is \nwrong but where the solution is still acceptable: waiting for a definitive fix.  \nThe model is not perfect (why would state F and state B be in the same NOT OK \nzone? Should we not distinguish two different subzones? Etc. But it gives a different insight \ninto the subject\u2019s experience than the mere tree of Figure 2.  \nFinally, the dynamical-systems approach is useful because it enables us to describe a \nphenomenon we frequently observe: in some areas of the phase space, the subjects tend to \nget captured by \u2018cognitive attractors\u2019, that is the automatically, and almost against their will, \nget sidetracked into performing some other activity. A typical instance of this is \u2018doing email\u2019: \nwhen  the subject opens her mailbox for a specific reason, she will tend to do a complete \nprocessing of all new emails. It seems that \u2018the situation has a momentum of its own\u2019. These \nphenomena, which have been described elsewhere (Lahlou, 2000, 2009), are frequent to the \npoint  that we suspect a large part of ordinary activity is simply chaining execution of such \n\u2018attractors\u2019 as the subjects get into the situations proposed by their environment. Technically, \nin dynamical-systems formalism, an attractor is a compact set of the phase space, into which \nall nearby trajectories converge. The basin of attraction is the set of points whose trajectories \nconverge to the attractor: in other words, a basin of attraction is a set of initial conditions that \nlead towards this attractor. When the phase space contains several attractors, each attractor \nhas its own \u2018basin of attraction\u2019. The separating varieties that mark the border between two \nbasins are places of bifurcation, where the system can switch from one attractor to another. \nThe intuition behind the use of activity phase space as a metaphor to describe human \nexperience is therefore very similar to the one that was at the basis of Kurt Lewin\u2019s dynamic \npsychology, and more particularly his field theory (Lewin, 1951), where the behaviour \ndepends on the position of the individual in a life-world, characterized by force fields \n(although Lewin used different mathematical conventions, based on the physics of his time). \nIn practice, as we said, it is difficult to describe in a comprehensive way the phase \nspace corresponding to the behaviour of a subject. So the concept of attractor, for example, \nwill likely wait several decades before we can make quantified applications; nevertheless it \nremains usable in principle. An activity is a path in the lived world, a phenomenological \ntunnel of perception-action. It unfolds in time. At a given moment, it corresponds to a certain \narrangement of objects around it and to the internal conditions of the subject (e.g. \u2018sitting at \nmy computer, typing on the keyboard with my email open). When the subject is cruising her \nphase space, if her trajectory accidentally or deliberately crosses a basin of attraction, this \naction will tend to be executed. E.g. \u2018sitting at my computer, typing on my keyboard with \nemail open\u2019 will most probably trigger an email session. As subjects are to some extent \naware of this phenomenon, and of the \u2018autonomous momentum\u2019 that certain zones of the \nphase space carry, they can label these zones in terms of activity and of what states they will \nprobably lead into (e.g. danger zones, etc.).  \nOnce again, it is the job of the interviewer top make this latent knowledge that the \nsubjects have of their life-word and own experience made explicit in the interview.  \n \n24 \nAs the reader can see, our approach is very open and flexible. We suggest adapting it \nto the situation at hand. The important elements are to collect the goals, decision-making \nprocesses and other mental psychological aspects of activity, in order to give as an account \nof experience complete as possible. The trajectory metaphor is used loosely to help the \nsubjects structure their explicitation both hierarchically and sequentially, that is along the two \nmain dimensions of the organization of goal-directed activity (Cranach, M\u00e4chler & Steiner, \n1985). The spatial metaphor also helps the subject to highlight as stages the loci of possible \nbifurcation, which are usually the most interesting moments.  \nGiven that this explicitation takes the form of a semi-directive interview, it is not so \nimportant that the subject himself does or does not fully understand what a dynamical system \nis, and what \u201cactivity theory\u201d is --- as long as the researcher who conducts the explicitation \ndoes. If this is the case, the researcher will know what kind of explicitation she needs from \nthe subject, and adapt accordingly. \n \n5.2 Limitations \n \nAt this point, one may wonder why we are using such a vague and flexible protocol for data \ncollection. The sad truth is that, in the current state of the art, we (at least our group) know \ntoo little to be able to recommend very precise guidelines, since the situations of data \ncollection are complex, and one-size-fits-all methodology does not seem commendable. \nBehind this is a problem of fuzziness at the theoretical level: human experience is a \ncomplex phenomenon, as was shown in Section 2. Brilliant scholars have tackled the \nproblem, following Husserl. Alfred Sch\u00fctz wrote sharp and deep pages on this issue and \nmade the effort to analyze the issue of mental planning and reconstruction of activity by the \nsubject himself in the perspectives provided by Husserl, Dewey, Bergson and Leibniz \n(Sch\u00fctz, 1951).While his discussion is fascinating, its practical implications for our purpose \nremain limited, since Sch\u00fctz leaves the question somewhat open.  \nIn general, there seems to be a gap between theoretical discussions and practical \napplications to everyday research. Being very theoretical was also to some extent the \nproblem for activity theory (Rubinstein, 1957; Leont'ev, 1978; Nosulenko & Rabardel, 2007), \nat least until recent developments in \u2018perceived quality\u2019 (Nosulenko, Parizet & Samoylenko, \n1998; Nosulenko & Samoylenko, 2001) proposed methodology which has passed the test of \nreal-life applications.  \nBecause there is still discussion on the very nature of the cognitive correlates of \nbehaviour, it is not surprising that the categories used to describe them in empirical research \nremain problematic. Let us take, for example, Von Cranach\u2019s school of \u2018goal-directed action\u2019 \ntheory (Ginsburg, Brenner, & Cranach, 1985), which is certainly one of the best attempts to \ntackle the issue with a clear formalism. But its tenants come up with so many theoretical \ndimensions and distinctions that the theory becomes hardly usable in practice. On the other \nhand, \u2018simple\u2019 theories do not pass the reality test.  \nThe renewal of activity theory (Engestr\u00f6m, 1990; Kaptelinin, Kuutti, & Bannon, 1995; \nKuutti, 1996; Nardi, 1996) has brought progress in the theoretical aspects. There is a \ngrowing body of applied research that revolves around the issue of analysing activity, more \n25 \nand more with the use of video. Each group tends to propose their own methodology, a sign \nof the domain\u2019s methodological immaturity (see (Le Bellu et al., 2010; Sonntag et al., 2002) \nfor reviews). But similarities emerge, which is all the more remarkable seeing that the authors \nstart from very different theoretical perspectives.  \nThe general and indeed rather vague instructions proposed here are in the same vein \nof empowering the subject with some communication framework (narration, explanation to \ncolleague, description for a novice, etc.) in order to facilitate the process of introspection and \ntranslation of personal experience into typified, understandable communication. For this, a \nformat of social communication that makes sense for the subject is necessary. Therefore \nhere, as in most techniques, communication combines the content and sharing \n(kommunikatsiya and obschenie) aspects by providing a partner and an audience in the \nperson of the researcher and the community of friendly fellow men s(he) should impersonate. \nThe description of experience for its transmission (typically: in a training process, from \nexpert to novice) requires a description in a format that enables one to understand the nature \nof the activity. This means that the main components of activity as it is experienced and \nperformed must be evidenced in the format: this includes not only the performed actions \n(motor movements, acts of thought) but also the goals, motives and rationales for strategies. \nThis is what we tried to provide with our explicitation technique based on subjective \nrecording. \nActivity theory teaches us that the behaviour we actually observe when a subject \nperforms her task is not the activity itself but merely one possible path that was chosen in \nthis specific situation to reach the goal in the conditions given. For example, when this \nsubject takes a key and turns it clockwise four times to close the valve, the purpose of the \nactivity is not to turn a key four times clockwise, but rather to regulate the flow so that it \nattains a desired value, which depends on the global situation of the system. Were the initial \nstate of the system different, for the same purpose the subject might have to turn the key e.g. \ntwo times counter-clockwise. And in fact, the use of the key may be only an emergency \nprocedure when the valve\u2019s motor is not working. \nTherefore, what is important is to clarify the goal and the rationale for decision \nmaking; because these are what enable sense making of the subject\u2019s experience by \nanother subject, as well as a profitable transfer of that experience. What matters is not so \nmuch the exact protocol that is used, but the fact that in the end we manage to capture the \ngoals and other psychological aspects of activity. If the subject can provide them easily, fine. \nIf not, the researcher must be creative and adapt the interview strategy to the case at hand. \n \n6 Conclusions \n \nSharing human experience is essential for learning. It is also a crucial aspect of social life. \nThe two aspects of communication (kommunikatsiya and obschenie) are always present \ntogether, and this must be kept in mind when considering the future impact of digital \ntechnologies.  \nThis impact will be massive, as with any technique that changes the system of \nrepresentation of human experience. By forwarding the hypothesis that \u2018we wish to share \n26 \nexperience more than we want to transmit knowledge\u2019, we suggested that social media will in \nthe future be used for experience sharing; to transfer more and more multimodal, intimate, \naspects of individual experience; and to build communities, as the same time as they grow \nas communication systems.  \nThe articles collected in this issue show some directions in which this is beginning to \nhappen, with new techniques and systems of capture and transfer; with the creation of new \nnarrative formats; with institutional initiatives to control or create reasoned frameworks for \nthis emerging flow. They point at both the human capacity to adapt to digital representations, \nand the dangers of a globally connected system where these representations flow in \nsometimes-unexpected ways. \nWe proposed a format to describe human experience as a trajectory of transitions \nbetween states of the system. The format is based on the use of subjective recording of \nactivity, enabled by digital technologies, and especially the Subcam. This recording is then \nexplicated by the subject in a semi-directive process, which uses activity theory as a \nframework to structure the description of relevant elements. The protocol helps the subject to \nmake his psychological processes explicit by proposing the description of activity as a step-\nby-step trajectory, in a space of possible states, a technique loosely inspired by dynamical \nsystems theory. This provides descriptions of the local processes of transition from one state \nto the next. The method is designed to be vague and flexible enough to be adapted to local \ncases: this weakness of the method is also what makes it robust. \nIn the end, what matters is the transmission of experience from one human to \nanother. The human (body and mind) is by design the best (and only) instrument that can \ndecode and interpret human experience. Our efforts, as a species, and as researchers, are \ndirected at finding the best proxies to transfer this experience from human body to human \nbody. To the biological level of emotion decoding (which we share with social animals) \nhuman culture has added stories, using symbolic language and graphic representations. \nNow the art of narration will have at hand new powerful digital tools to transmit more aspects \nof human experience, and to transmit them on a large scale. This will augment the forms of \nconnectedness and sharing. Whatever new forms of civilization emerge from this will \ncertainly be interesting to watch. \n \n \nSaadi Lahlou is Professor at the London School of Economics and Political Science, \nwhere he is the director of the Institute of Social Psychology.

What we do here is very similar to the husserlian \u00ab phenomenological reduction \u00bb which \nenables to discuss the subjective experience while leaving aside the epistemic issues of \nrealism and relativism. \u201cThe phenomenologist does not deny the existence of the outer \nworld, but for his analytical purpose he makes up his mind to suspend belief in its \nexistence \u2013that is, to refrain intentionally and systematically from all judgements related \ndirectly or indirectly to the existence of the outer world. Borrowing from mathematical \ntechnique, Husserl called this procedure \u201cputting the world in brackets\u201d or \u201cperforming the \nphenomenological reduction\u201d. There is nothing mysterious in these notions, which are \nmerely names for the technical device of phenomenology for radicalizing the Cartesian \nmethod of philosophical doubt, in order to go beyond the natural attitude of man living \nwithin the world he accepts, be it reality or mere appearance.\u201d (Sch\u00fctz, [1944], 1962 p. \n104)  \n3. \u201cWhat remains after the performance of the transcendental reduction is nothing less than \nthe universe of our conscious life, the stream of thought in its integrity, with all its activities \nand with all the cogitations and experiences (both terms being used in the broadest the \nCartesian- sense, which also includes not only perceptions, conceptions, judgements, but \nalso acts of will, feelings, dreams, fantasies etc.\u201d (Sch\u00fctz, [1944], 1962 p. 104) \n \nReferences \n \nBach-y-Rita, P., Danilov, Y., Tyler, M.
