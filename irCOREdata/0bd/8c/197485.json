Indeed, the experiences of the 17th-century Dutch Republic, 18th-century England, and \nthe 19th-century United States offer powerful narratives to support this view.1 Yet the role of \ngovernments in fostering growth through improved institutions has received less attention in \nmodern macroeconomic and development studies that use more recent data. This is not to say, \nhowever, that economists have ignored the role of institutions in promoting growth over the \npost-World War II period. On the contrary, a battery of empirical studies published over the past \ntwo decades point to a first-order importance of financial development in promoting long-run \neconomic growth, and have elevated the proposition to something of a stylised fact (Levine, \n1997, 2005).2 At the same time, a largely independent literature indicates a positive role for trade \nopenness and export orientation in long-run growth, especially when tested over the latter half of \nthe twentieth century with data for a broad set of countries (Dollar, 1992; Ben-David, 1993; \nSachs and Warner, 1995; Edwards, 1998).  \n Much of the research on financial development in recent years, however, has shifted from \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n1\u00a0See, for example, de Vries (1976) and de Vries and van der Woude (1997) on the Dutch \nRepublic, Dickson (1967) and Brewer (1989) on England, Neal (1990) on integration of the \nLondon and Amsterdam markets, and Sylla (1999) on the United States. More recent \ncomparative studies of these countries and others include Rousseau (2003), Rousseau and Sylla \n(2003) and Andrianova et al. (2008). \n \u00a0\n2\u00a0This is not to say that there is universal agreement on the direction of causation (Demetriades \nand Hussein, 1996), the extent to which the effect is generalisable to a wide range of countries \n(Rioja and Valev, 2004), or whether the relationship has weakened over the past twenty years \n(Rousseau and Wachtel, 2011). \n \u00a0\n3\u00a0\n\u00a0\nmeasuring the growth effects of finance to learning more about what determines financial \ndevelopment itself.  It is in this area that the link between finance and trade has received some \nattention (Svaleryd and Vlachos, 2002; Baltagi et al., 2009). Here we extend this line of inquiry \nby bringing governments into the nexus of finance and trade, starting with 18th century England \nand then broadening the analysis to 84 countries using data from 1960 to the present. \n Our starting point is historical.  In the early stages of economic and financial development, \ncountries may find themselves caught in an under-development trap. The absence of financial \nmarkets, both domestic and international, combined with an under-developed tax base and \ninefficiencies in tax administration can lead to governments that are cash constrained.  Without \nsufficient funds, governments are unable to undertake much needed public investments in hard \nand soft infrastructure, education and health. Inadequate transportation networks, rudimentary \nlaw and order systems, and ill and\/or illiterate populations can create insurmountable obstacles \nfor industrial take-off. 3  In such circumstances, opportunities for profitable private investment \nare rare. Where present, they can be very risky. And without insurance markets, the risks are \nlikely to be unacceptably high for entrepreneurs.  As a result the demand for private finance may \nbe negligible or non-existent.  In such a bad equilibrium, financial and economic under-\ndevelopment are two sides of the same coin.   \n Trade offers a way to break out of the under-development trap.  However, history has \nshown that this requires a high degree of co-ordination between private and public sectors.  \nTrade can be highly profitable if it is secure yet the profits can easily be competed away.

There is also a large literature on the positive effects of infrastructure on \nprivate investment, trade and economic growth (Bougheas, Demetriades and Morgenroth, 1999; \nBougheas, Demetriades and Mamuneas, 2000).\u00a0\n4\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAndrianova et al. (2011) and others have argued, the emergence of London as a financial market \nin the latter part of the 17th century owes a lot to the monopoly rights granted by government to \nall the leading joint stock companies. These rights guaranteed high returns to investors and \nhelped to mobilise saving (the share issues of the East India Company, for example, were \ntypically over-subscribed).  The rise of the great trading companies in turn promoted \ndevelopment of a modern commercial sector. The monopoly rights were granted at a price: the \njoint stock companies made very significant long-term loans to the government. These loans \nwere so large that they transformed the state of the public finances. As Rousseau (2003) shows, \nthe rise in real incomes that followed the expansion of trade set in motion a virtuous finance-\ntrade-growth cycle which helped to propel England from a weak state in the early part of the \n17th century to Europe\u2019s foremost military power by the beginning of the 18th century and the \nworld\u2019s clear financial leader by its end.4   \n  Given the central role of governments in promoting financial and commercial \ndevelopment in history, might we expect to see similar patterns today in developing countries?  \nWe think that the answer is yes, although the picture can be more complex because developing \ncountries today have greater (yet still varying degrees of) access to world capital markets and \nforeign aid. For the poorest developing countries, foreign aid is an important mechanism for \nfinancing trade-promoting infrastructure and public investment in health and education.  As a \nresult, the link between government spending and domestic financial development may be \nweaker than it is likely to have been, for example, in 18th century England, where governments \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n4\u00a0Similar events were realised a century earlier in Amsterdam. The Dutch East India Company, \nwhich had very close links to the Dutch state, was formed in 1602 by royal charter following \ndemands by its predecessors who saw their profits eroded by competition.  The emergence of the \nstock market in Amsterdam is firmly linked to the establishment of the Company (Neal, 1990).\u00a0\n5\u00a0\n\u00a0\ntapped much if not all of their finance domestically. For the same reason, we would expect a \nstronger link between government and domestic financial development in middle income \ncountries. \n First, however, it is appropriate to consider 18th century England, often touted as the \nclassic case of the centrality of the State in modern economic emergence. \n \n2 18TH CENTURY ENGLAND  \n2.1  Background \n \n Modern studies of the role of the state in 18th century British growth tend to focus on the \nextent to which wartime expenditures led to a crowding out of private sector investments, \nthereby slowing overall economic growth (Williamson, 1984; Crafts, 1987; Mokyr, 1987).  But \nif disbursements by the exchequer are a weak proxy for the output of the government, as Jackson \n(1990) has argued, the multiplier of actual government expenditure may have been larger, in \nwhich case crowding out would have been less severe.  \n Fig. 1 shows total government expenditure from 1720 along with total trade (i.e., the sum \nof imports, exports, and re-exports), all in per capita 1740 sterling. 5  The four large spikes in the \nexpenditure series corresponding with the War of Austrian Succession (1740-48), the Seven \nYears War (1754-63), the American Revolutionary War (1775-83), and the Wars of the First and \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n5\u00a0Government expenditures are the sum of civil and military spending from Mitchell (1988, \nTable 11.2, pp. 578-80). The trade data are from Mitchell (1988, Table 10.1.A, pp. 448-9 for \nEngland and Wales for 1720-91, and Table 10.1.B, p. 450 for Great Britain 1792-99). To form a \nsingle series for trade openness we join the broader aggregate for Great Britain to the narrower \nseries for England and Wales. We deflate all of our data to reflect 1740 prices using the \nSchumpeter-Gilboy price index for consumer goods (Mitchell, 1988, Table 14.1.B, pp. 719-20) \nand convert them into per capita terms using population data for England (excluding \nMonmouthshire) from Mitchell (1988, Table 1.1.A, pp. 7-8). \n\u00a0\n6\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSecond Coalitions (1793-1802).6  It would seem that large lumpy expenditures such as these \ncould not have been conducive to an industrial take-off.  Yet total trade, a rough proxy for \nactivity in the commercial (i.e., modern) sector of the economy, with the exception of the \nAmerican Revolutionary period, does not fluctuate sharply and negatively with government \nexpenditure.  Rather, the two series have a positive correlation coefficient of 0.49, with \ninternational trade rising by 88 percent between 1720 and 1799 despite the American War. \n  \n[INSERT FIG. 1 HERE] \n \n  \n At the same time that trade was rising dramatically, England was in the midst of a \ncommercial and industrial revolution.  And when the time series for trade in Fig. 1 is considered \nin light of earlier data for the East India Company that indicate a more than six-fold increase in \nAsian exports between 1660 and 1710, the rapid commercialisation of the British economy \ncomes into clear focus. It is interesting to note that Hoffman\u2019s index of industrial production \n(Mitchell, 1988, Table 8.21.A, pp. 431-432, including building),  progresses less rapidly than the \ntrade series at first, but accelerates after 1780, and thus seems to share the rhythm of the later \npart of the trade boom.  \n The positive relation between government expenditure and trade requires explanation. \nWas the crowding out suggested by earlier studies a short-run phenomenon while state \ninterventions promoted growth in a long-term sense through a less direct \u201cbig push\u201d mechanism?  \nWe argue here that such a push started with public sector investments that raised income, \nproduction, trade, and bank deposits, with the latter providing significant feedback effects to the \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n6\u00a0Our sample period was preceded by the War of Spanish Succession (1700-14) and by the Nine \nYears War (1688-97), the latter commencing with the Glorious Revolution of 1688. \n\u00a0\n7\u00a0\n\u00a0\ncommercial sector as the Bank of England shifted its asset portfolio towards private loans. This \nallowed government expenditure, finance, and commerce, as measured by the extent of trading \nactivity, to interact in a complementary manner. \n The main public expenditure early on, of course, involved gearing up for war, and a \npositive interaction between the government and banking began as Parliament strove to raise \nfinance for the Nine-Years War against France in 1688. A key problem for the government at the \ntime was the illiquidity of its own bonds, so it formed the Bank of England in 1694 to buy and \nhold this debt while the underlying capitalisation of the Bank itself could trade with greater \nliquidity on the newly-formed London stock market.7  Over the next fifty years, the Bank would \nbecome, to quote R. D. Richards (1934, p. 272), \u201ca credit institution, an organ of State Finance, a \ndiscount and issuing house, a bullion warehouse, and a safe repository.\u201d  \n Shortly after its founding, the Bank re-coined the nation\u2019s metallic currency and engaged \nin various note-issuing experiments, both of which promoted monetisation and brought some \ndegree of order to the fledgling financial system. The dashed line in Fig. 2 shows how the real \nper capita liabilities of the Bank (i.e., the sum of its circulation and deposits) increased rapidly \nthrough the early 1730s before declining slightly and then levelling off for the remainder of the \ncentury. 8 The ability of the Bank to bring about intensive growth in ordinary deposits early on \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n7\u00a0The stock exchange facilitated transactions in public debt securities and shares of the large \ntrading companies, including the British East and West India Companies, the South Sea \nCompany, and the Royal African Company.  \n\u00a0\n8\u00a0We obtain the Bank\u2019s deposit and circulation liabilities from Mitchell (1988, Table 12.2.A, pp. \n655-58). It is probably fair to say that coin and Bank of England notes accounted for most of the \ncirculating medium it in London and elsewhere before 1750 given that London\u2019s private bankers \nhad stopped issuing notes, which were always a small part of their business, long before 1775 \ndue to competition from the Bank of England (Cameron, 1967, p. 22). But an increase in the \n8\u00a0\n\u00a0\nproved essential to supporting the government expenditures that would become necessary in the \n1740s and 1750s.  Even the extensive growth in deposits after 1750, though not impressive, was \nconsiderable given the 50 percent increase in England\u2019s population between 1750 and 1799. 9  \n \n[INSERT FIG. 2 HERE] \n \n \nBut while the Bank\u2019s relationship with the State has received the most attention among \nscholars, the Bank also offered considerable support to London\u2019s merchant and trading \ncommunities through its clearing and discounting facilities (Clapham, 1941). The solid line in \nFig. 2 shows the extent of the Bank of England\u2019s private loan business, which grew rapidly from \nthe 1750s, even approaching the size of its deposit and circulation liabilities during the 1760s \nand again by 1800.10  Much of this activity was accomplished through the Bank\u2019s \u201cdrawing \naccounts,\u201d though not all those with accounts were entitled to advances.11 Evidence from the \nBank archives described in Clapham (1941, 1945) show that loans and discounts were spread \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nnumber of country banks after 1775 and a lack of reliable information on net specie imports \nmake us unable to build a continuous series for an M2-like aggregate.   \n\u00a0\n9\u00a0Since the Bank\u2019s deposit and circulation liabilities were presumably zero before its founding in \n1694, their growth prior to the start of our data in 1720 must have been very rapid. This apparent \nrise in liabilities, for which we see only the tail end in Fig. 2, also coincided with another spike \nin government expenditures during the War of Spanish Succession (1700-14).    \n\u00a0\n10\u00a0We build this series as the income from discounting bills and notes and making private loans \n(Clapham, 1945, Vol. 1, Appendix E, pp. 301-2 and Vol. II, Appendix C, p. 433) divided by the \nBank rate over the previous year (Clapham, 1945, Vol. I, Appendix D, p. 299, and Vol. II, \nAppendix B, pp. 429). This assumes that the Bank of England\u2019s loans were primarily short term, \nwhich is consistent with Clapham\u2019s reading of the loan records. \n\u00a0\n11\u00a0The Bank also made over ninety loans to the East India Company between 1709 and 1744, but \nthese loans, though exceeding other bill and note discounts in the Bank\u2019s early days, did not \nbecome an important component of the asset portfolio until the 1750s. \n\u00a0\n9\u00a0\n\u00a0\nacross a wide range of commercial activities, and that discounts below the statutory limit of \u00a350 \nwere not unusual.  And as liabilities struggled to keep up with population by the late 1730s, the \nBank\u2019s capital and deposits were increasingly deployed toward the provision of private loans, \nsome of which were used to facilitate trade. With the large trading companies making loans to \nthe government through the Bank of England, and these (often military) expenditures making \ntheir way back into the deposit liabilities of the Bank, we believe that the rise and accompanying \nfluctuations in the amount and availability of private loans could have strongly influenced \ncommerce just as the industrial economy hit its stride after 1760.     \nThe Bank\u2019s private loans may also be representative of commercial lending in England \nmore generally because, before 1750, the Bank of England co-existed in the provision of \nbanking services only with a group of private bankers in London who dealt primarily in deposits \nand bills of exchange. This gave rise to an active money market to finance trade and working \ncapital for the emerging manufacturing sector, and the Bank had a central role in its operation.  \nMoreover, England was slow to develop private banks compared to the pace at which they \nwould grow in the United States only 50 years later.12     \n \n2.2    Empirical Analysis \n \n Is the available evidence for 18th century England consistent with virtuous cycles of \ngovernment expenditure, trade and financial development?  Though our historical focus limits \nthe richness of the data items that can be brought to bear on our hypothesis, the data depicted in \nFig. 1 and Fig. 2 are sufficient for conducting at least a basic time series investigation. We limit \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n12\u00a0Relatively little is known about the extent of country banking in 18th century England. These \nbanks were generally small, but grew in number. Cameron (1967, pp. 23-24) estimates that \n\u201cabout a dozen\u201d existed in 1750, about 100 in the early 1780s, and about 300 by 1800. \n\u00a0\n10\u00a0\n\u00a0\nthe time coverage to 1728 to 1799 because this represents the period for which reliable data on \nprivate loans of the Bank of England are continuously available on an annual basis.  We have \nargued above that this variable might capture the intensity of financial intermediation well.  \n Table 1 provides time-series evidence of the relationship between government \nexpenditure, trade openness and financial development, with all three variables measured on a \nreal, per capita basis. The upper panel reports results from a vector autoregressive (VAR) model \nestimated in log levels.13 Both trade and government expenditure Granger-cause private loans at \nthe five percent level or less with the regression coefficients for each variable summing to a \npositive value. This suggests that both of these variables drive financial development, which is \nconsistent with our view of the mechanism at work.  \n  \n[INSERT TABLE 1 HERE] \n \n  \nThe Johansen (1991) tests for co-integration reported in center panel of Table 1 show a \nsingle long-term relationship among the three variables, with both the trace and maximum \neigenvalue statistics rejecting the null of no co-integration and failing to reject the null of a \nsingle co-integrating vector. \nThe lower panel of Table 1 reports estimates from the corresponding vector error \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n13\u00a0Before estimating the VAR, we tested each series for non-stationarity using Augmented \nDickey-Fuller (ADF) tests. We were unable to reject the null hypothesis of a unit root for any of \nthese series using three to five additional lag differences in the test regressions. All three series \nrejected the null in first differences. Since our Johansen (1991) tests indicate that the series share \na single co-integrating relationship, a VAR model in levels is appropriate (Sims et al., 1990). We \ndetermine the lag order of the VAR using a series of nested likelihood ratio tests.

The negative and significant sum of the regression coefficients on first \ndifferences of both government expenditure and trade in the private loans equation suggest that \nboth crowded out Bank of England private loans in the short-run. The negative sign on the error \ncorrection term (ECT) in the private loans equation, however, when viewed with the negative \nloadings on trade and government expenditure in the normalised co-integrating vector, is also \nconsistent with financial development responding positively in the long run to perturbations to \nthe ECT caused by increases in trade openness and government expenditure. This is similar to \nthe overall effects reported for the levels VAR in the upper panel.  The final equation of the \nVECM indicates that government expenditure is also not weakly exogenous, suggesting that \nfinancial development may have had positive long-run effects on the resources available to the \ngovernment. \nThe cumulative impulse responses depicted in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 confirm the positive long \nrun effects of government expenditure and trade openness on private loans, and the magnitudes \nof these effects are economically substantial.  A one percent change in government expenditure, \nfor example, is associated with an increase of 0.2 percent in private loans within six years of the \nshock, while a one percent change in trade is associated with a 0.17 percent change in private \nloans within eight years.  \n \n[INSERT FIG. 3 AND FIG. 4 HERE] \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n14\u00a0We form the VECM by inserting the stationary linear combination of the data (i.e., the ECT) \nat a single lag into an otherwise standard VAR in first differences with four lags, and normalise \nthe co-integrating vector on the Bank of England\u2019s private loans.   \n\u00a0\n12\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \n \n3       EVIDENCE FROM A PANEL OF COUNTRIES: 1960-2004 \n \nIn light of our historical findings for England, we now ask whether our hypothesis, namely \nthat governments and trade can contribute to a \u201cbig push\u201d by promoting development of the \nfinancial sector, has some support in more modern data. To this end, we obtained cross section \nand panel data on financial and macroeconomic indicators for 84 countries over the period from \n1960 to 2004 from the 2009 edition of the World Bank\u2019s World Development Indicators.15  The \nselection of countries is based on data availability from this source. \nAs before, we measure trade openness as the ratio of imports plus exports. Government is \nmeasured as final expenditures, excluding the military.16  For comparability with other studies, \nwe use three familiar measures of financial development, namely liquid liabilities (M3), liquid \nliabilities less narrow money (M3 less M1), and credit allocated to the private sector.  To \nfacilitate cross-country analysis, we express all variables as percentages of gross domestic \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n15\u00a0\u00a0The 84 countries are Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belgium, \nBolivia, Brasil, Cameroon, Canada, Central African Republic, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, \nCote d\u2019Ivoire, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Fiji, Finland, \nFrance, Gambia, Ghana, Greece, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Iceland, India, Indonesia, \nIran, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Republic of Korea, Lesotho, \nLuxembourg, Malawi, Malaysia, Malta, Mauritius, Mexico, Morocco, Nepal, Netherlands, New \nZealand, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Norway, Pakistan, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, \nPeru, Philippines, Portugal, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, \nSudan, Sweden, Switzerland, Syrian Arab Republic, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Togo, \nTurkey, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe.  \n16\u00a0\u00a0It is reasonable to exclude military expenditures from our measure of government for the post-\n1960 period given that wars have not been a mechanism through which financial sectors have \nemerged and their inclusion would distort identification of the agglomeration effects that we \nhypothesise. In this respect the role of wars in financial development today differs considerably \nfrom that in the earlier days of British economic emergence.   \n\u00a0\n13\u00a0\n\u00a0\nproduct (GDP).  Liquid liabilities as a percentage of GDP have become a standard measure of \nfinancial depth and an indicator of the overall size of financial intermediary activity in cross-\ncountry studies. M3 less M1 removes the pure transactions asset to focus more on the intensity \nof intermediation, and the credit measure isolates intermediation to the private sector from credit \nallocated to government or state enterprises. We average the data over five-year periods to build \na maximum of nine time series observations for each country starting with 1960-64 and ending \nwith 2000-2004. \nConsistent with our hypothesis, the starting point is a set of cross-country regressions of \nthe form \n \nFDit =  \uf0610 + \uf061GOVit  + \uf062TRD it + \u2202X it + uit,     (1) \n \nwhere FDit is a measure of financial development, GOVit is government expenditure, TRDit is \ntrade openness, and Xit is a set of baseline explanatory variables that have been shown \nempirically to be robust determinants of growth. We then estimate a second set of regressions \nthat reverse the positions of trade openness and financial development \n \nTRDit =  \uf0610 + \uf061GOVit  + \uf062FD it + \u2202X it + vit..     (2) \n \nThe conditioning set (i.e., the Xit) for the financial development regressions includes per \ncapita income and CPI inflation, in accordance with the empirical literature on the determinants \nof financial development (Rousseau and Wachtel, 2002; Baltagi et al., 2009). The trade \nopenness regressions additionally condition on the initial value of aggregate GDP in each five-\nyear period to capture the effects of country size on trade.  We anticipate that country size \nmatters in a negative way when it comes to trade openness in that, all other things equal, larger \n14\u00a0\n\u00a0\ncountries need to trade less than smaller countries, as consumers and firms are able to source a \ngreater range of products domestically at lower cost.  Estimation is by instrumental variables to \nameliorate potential problems of simultaneity. Specifically, we attempt to extract the \npredetermined component of the financial variable by using its initial value (in each five-year \nperiod) along with the initial values of government expenditure and trade as percentages of GDP \nas instruments in each regression equation. \n Table 2 presents estimates of the regressions specified in (1) and (2) using the full set of \nfive-year observations in our 84-country sample. All estimates include time period fixed effects.  \nThe coefficient on trade openness is highly statistically significant in all three financial \ndevelopment regressions (see left side of table) and so is the coefficient on initial GDP per \ncapita, but neither government expenditure or CPI inflation is statistically significant.  \n  \n    [INSERT TABLE 2 HERE] \n \n Table 3 and Table 4 examine the extent to which the results reported in Table 2 vary with \nper capita income by running quartile regressions.  In the interest of space these tables report \nresults using only liquid liabilities as a percentage of GDP as the financial variable, but the \nfindings are broadly similar with our other two measures of financial development. The \nestimates reported in both tables suggest that both relationships vary considerably according to \ncountry income levels, hence relying on the aggregate results in Table 2 can be misleading. \n \n[INSERT TABLE 3 HERE] \n \nThe results in Table 3 reveal that government expenditure has a positive and highly \nsignificant effect on financial development in the second and third income quartiles.  Its effect in \n15\u00a0\n\u00a0\nthe first quartile is positive but not significant while it is negative and highly significant in the \nfourth quartile.  These results suggest that at very low income levels, government spending does \nnot seem to promote more intense financial intermediation, possibly reflecting a country\u2019s \nreliance on foreign aid and soft international loans in the early stages of development. At \nintermediate levels of income, governments\u2019 financing requirements will need to be at least \npartially satisfied from domestic sources, which may explain why government spending impacts \npositively on the development of the domestic financial system.  The reversal of this effect at \nhigh levels of income suggest that high public sector borrowing requirements in developed \neconomies impact negatively on the size of the banking system.  This may be because in \ndeveloped economies, the growth of the public sector may crowd out rather than crowd in the \nprivate sector.  If the private sector relies more on the banking system than the public sector, \ncrowding out of the former by the latter is likely to result in a smaller banking system. \nTrade openness also has a positive and highly significant effect on financial depth in the \nsecond and third quartiles, a negative one in the fourth and an insignificant one in the first.  The \npositive effect of trade openness on financial development is consistent with existing empirical \nliterature (e.g., Baltagi et al., 2009) as well as with the great reversals hypothesis of Rajan and \nZingales (2003).  The positive and insignificant effect of trade openness on financial \ndevelopment in poor countries is perhaps not very surprising as it may to some extent be a \nreflection of more noisy data and a smaller number of observations. What is perhaps harder to \nexplain is the negative and significant effect found for the fourth quartile.  A plausible \nexplanation for this finding needs perhaps to recognise the role that money and capital markets \ncan play in promoting trade in developed economies. If, for example, firms can obtain cheaper \ntrade finance from money and capital markets than from banks, greater trade openness could \n16\u00a0\n\u00a0\nwell be associated with lower levels of banking system development. \n \n[INSERT TABLE 4 HERE] \n \nThe estimates reported in Table 4 show that government expenditure impacts positively on \ntrade openness at low and high income levels, but has no significant influence at intermediate \nlevels of income.  At low income levels, this may reflect the developmental nature of \ngovernment expenditures \u2013 infrastructure projects for example are likely to have high import \ncontent.  As countries develop, their capacity to undertake such projects domestically is likely to \nimprove, which can explain the insignificant coefficient at the intermediate income levels.  On \nthe other hand, the positive and larger in magnitude coefficient of government expenditure at \nhigh income levels is somewhat puzzling.  It suggests that high government expenditures at \nthese levels are trade promoting, but it is not obvious why.  \nThe effects of financial development on trade openness are interesting and much less \nsurprising.  It appears that they tend to decline with income, being at their highest at low income \nlevels, suggesting that financial development may have some if not all of its growth promoting \neffects early on by supporting trade.  For the fourth income quartile the effects of financial \ndevelopment are small and significant only at the ten percent level.  In the intermediate region \nthe effects taper off but are still sizeable and significant, suggesting that financial development \ncontinues to be important in promoting economic openness in such countries.  Interestingly, the \neffects of per capita income on trade are significant only in the first and second quartiles while \nthe negative-size effect is highly significant in all quartiles.   \nThe results in Table 3 and Table 4 confirm that the aggregate results mask important \nvariation that exists among different groups of countries.  Different policy recommendations \n17\u00a0\n\u00a0\nmay therefore be appropriate for different stages of development.  At low income levels, \neconomic development is the only variable that appears to drive financial development, since \nboth trade openness and government spending have positive and insignificant coefficients at \nconventional levels.  At intermediate income levels, both government expenditure and trade \nopenness are significant drivers of banking system development.  At high levels of income both \nthese effects are reversed, reflecting perhaps the increased role played by money and capital \nmarkets and crowding out of the private sector by the government. \nAt the very initial stages of development, government spending seems to support trade. It \nis only later, when the commercial sector is more developed, that government expenditure would \nbe directed toward trade-promoting infrastructure such as ports, railroads, and roads, which \nultimately create income that feeds back into the financial sector. As economic development \nprogresses, government expenditure begins to facilitate the emergence of domestic finance, \nbecause governments begin to borrow from domestic banks, which are able to mobilise more \nsavings.  \n \n4   CONCLUDING REMARKS \nWe make a first attempt to examine empirically the interactions between government \nexpenditure, trade openness and financial development utilising data from 18th century England \nand a panel of 84 countries from 1960-2004. For England, we find that the government and \ninternational trade did have positive effects on financial development when measured as the \nvalue of private loans issued at the Bank of England. For the wider panel of countries and more \nrecent data, we find that government expenditure seems to have positive effects on financial \ndevelopment for countries that are in the mid-ranges of economic development as measured by \n18\u00a0\n\u00a0\nper capita income, but has little effect for poor countries and a strongly negative effect for the \nwealthiest ones.  \nThe historical and more modern analyses are both consistent with a mutually supportive \ngovernment-trade-finance nexus that reaches its peak of effectiveness once an economy begins \nto modernise. England, for example, had shown signs of modernising prior to the Glorious \nRevolution of 1688, but military conflicts and the rise of a stronger Parliamentary state allowed \nthe Bank of England to form and evolve along with a host of other financial institutions, setting \nthe nexus into motion. Indeed, with a per capita income of more than $1,000 (1990 US) by 1770, \nEngland would have been firmly in the second quartile of our broad cross-section of economies \nmeasured in 1990. \nWhen considering whether aspects of the British historical experience might be found in \nother early-industrialising nations, the United States immediately comes to mind. Though \nfinancially under-developed at the time of its War of Independence from 1776 to 1783, resources \nwere needed to fight the war and the provisional government resorted to printing fiat money and \nlater to issuing debt to Dutch and French investors. These issues allowed the fledgling nation to \nsupport its war effort, but rapid depreciation of its currency and the disorganised state of public \nfinances led its debts to trade at pennies on the dollar by the mid-1780s. But it was from these \ndepths that the nation\u2019s first Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton, engineered a \n\u201cFederalist financial revolution\u201d that involved setting up a central bank, refinancing the war \ndebts, and watching the new instruments rise to par within months as confidence in the U.S. \ngovernment and financial system grew among foreign investors (Rousseau and Sylla, 2005). \nThis early financial success set the stage for funding subsequent military needs as well as public \ninfrastructure projects such as canals, roads and bridges that facilitated private commerce.   \n19\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOur study takes exception to the usual view that government expenditure in general has a \ncrowding-out effect on private investment, and suggests that the government itself is essential to \nthe development of sound financial arrangements.  The effects of such a nexus, with the \nemergence of a modern sector reflected in the extent of international trade, are most emphatic as \neconomies begin to experience robust growth. This has strong implications for the staging of \ndevelopment policies today.     \n \n20\u00a0\n\u00a0\nREFERENCES \nAndrianova, S., Demetriades, P. and Xu, C.
