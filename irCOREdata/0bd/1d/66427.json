Introduction\nEver since its discovery by Castro-Tirado et al. (1994), the tran-\nsient Galactic source GRS 1915+105 has been a subject of in-\ntense observational and theoretical work. The source shows a\nnumber of remarkable features, most spectacular of which are\nejections of relativistic jets with apparent super-luminal mo-\ntion (Mirabel & Rodriguez 1994). It displays a large variety of\nbehaviour in the X-ray band (dramatic flux and spectral vari-\nability on time scales from miliseconds to months), most likely\nreflecting violent phenomena occurring in the inner accretion\nflow.\nLarge amount of data collected by various X-ray observato-\nries indicate that the source stays permanently in a soft spectral\nstate (see, e.g., Nowak 1995 for a characteristics of the vari-\nous spectral\/timing states). That is, its spectral energy distri-\nbution is dominated by the 1\u201310 keV band, even though the\nratio of soft thermal (temperature \u00181 keV) emission to harder\nComptonized continuum does vary substantially. The source\nnever seems to have been in the hard spectral state, which is\nmore typical for black hole binaries with energy distribution\npeaking at \u0018100 keV (see Poutanen 1998 for review).\nA characteristic feature of GRS 1915+105 is its strong vari-\nability, of both flux (count rate) and energy spectra. Among the\nvariety of light curves and color\u2013color diagrams certain pat-\nterns can be found. These were studied in detail by Belloni et al.\n(2000; hereafter B00), using RXTE data, who attempted to clas-\nsify the behaviour of the source. They divided the lightcurves\nSend offprint requests to: P. T. Z\u02d9ycki,\ne-mail: ptz@camk.edu.pl\ninto 12 classes based on the color-color diagrams and count\nrates, and found that the lightcurves from each class can be\ndecomposed into only 3 basic spectral states (A, B, C in the\nnomenclature of B00). The strongly variable lightcurves of the\nsource could be explained in terms of rapid switches between\nthese three states.\nThere have been previous attempts to model the X\u2013ray\nspectra of GRS 1915+105 in the B and C spectral states.\nVilhu et al. (2001) analyzed RXTE data (PCA\/HEXTE instru-\nments, in the range of 2\u201360 keV) and concluded that spectra\nof GRS 1915+105 can be described with the model consist-\ning of a disk blackbody and a Comptonized component with\nCompton reflection. Zdziarski et al. (2001) presented an analy-\nsis of simultaneous observations of GRS 1915+105 in states B\nand C by RXTE and CGRO\/OSSE instruments. They found that\nthe broad-band spectra required non-thermal Comptonization\nof soft photons, since the data do not show any break up to\nat least 600 keV. Low temperature, thermal Comptonization\nwas also needed to correctly model (together with blackbody\ncomponent) the soft X\u2013ray part (E < 10 keV), thus the best\nfinal model invoked a hybrid plasma (Coppi 1999). Vadavale\net al. (2001) focused on a study of the source during the steady\nlow-hard state (class \u03c7, state C), which they further subdi-\nvided into radio-loud (\u03c7RL) and radio-quiet (\u03c7RQ) ones. From\ntheir analysis followed that the spectrum of GRS 1915+105\nin state C can be described as a superposition of disk black-\nbody and Comptonized component, and an additional power\nlow component in the case of the \u03c7RL state. This additional\npower low was interpreted as an emission from the base of a jet.\nAnalysis of spectral features due to iron emission\/absorption in\n554 M. A. Sobolewska and P. T. Z\u02d9ycki: X\u2013ray modeling of GRS 1915+105\nthe 5\u20139 keV band was performed by Martocchia et al. (2002)\nusing BeppoSAX data of the source in state C, according to\ntheir interpretation. They found that the Fe K\u03b1 line is broad\nand it has the characteristic asymmetric profile indicating its\norigin from a rotating accretion disk.\nIn all above mentioned analyses, disk blackbody or black-\nbody component is used to (fully or partially) describe the\nsoft emission from the disk. The diskbb model reproduces the\nshape of the disk spectrum quite accurately unless the relativis-\ntic corrections are extreme. However, the numerical values of\nthe parameters do not easily translate into physical parameters\n(Merloni et al. 2000). These can be estimated from a rela-\ntivistic model, which includes radiative transfer e\u000bects, at least\napproximating them by introducing the color temperature cor-\nrection (Shimura & Takahara 1995).\nTherefore, in this paper we analyse data from all three spec-\ntral states of GRS 1915+105 , applying the same set of models\nto all the data. The models include one for emission from an\naccretion disk around a maximally rotating Kerr black hole.\n2. Data selection and reduction\nThe log of PCA\/HEXTE observations used for our analysis is\ngiven in Table 1. The data were extracted from public archive\nat HEASARC\/GSFC and reduced with the FTOOLS software\npackage (version 5.0).\nBased on B00 we attempted to extract spectra correspond-\ning to \u201cpure\u201d spectral states A, B and C. We have two observa-\ntions from class \u03c7 (pure state C), one observation from class \u03bb\nfrom which we extract a period corresponding to state B based\non the X\u2013ray color\u2013color diagrams and lightcurves appearance\n(see B00 for details), one observation from class \u03b8 which pro-\nvides state A spectra, and two observations from class \u03b2 \u2013 fur-\nther examples of state A, B, and C spectra.\nFor the spectral analysis, PCA Standard 2 mode data (PCU\n0-2, top layer only) and HEXTE Archive Mode (both clusters)\nconfiguration are used. The energy range is 3\u201320 keV and 20\u2013\n100 keV, correspondingly. We assume systematic errors in the\nPCA data at the level of 1% due to the uncertainty of response\nmatrices. Standard background subtraction and dead-time cor-\nrection procedures are applied.\nThe value of the hydrogen column density, NH, is allowed\nto vary during the fit. We assume that the source inclination is\ni = 70\u000e, distance d = 12.5 kpc (Mirabel & Rodriguez 1994)\nand central black hole mass M = 14 M\f (Greiner et al. 2001).\nWe allow for free relative normalization of HEXTE data with\nrespect to PCA data. Analysis was performed in XSPEC ver. 11\n(Arnaud 1996).\n3. Models\nThe disk soft thermal emission will be described by the sim-\nple disk blackbody model (Mitsuda et al. 1984; implemented\nas diskbb) in XSPEC, or a relativistic accretion disk model\nfor Kerr geometry (Ebisawa et al. 2001). The KerrD model is\ncomputed for the maximally rotating black hole (a = 0.998;\nThorne 1974). It assumes blackbody spectra at each radius with\nTable 1. The log of observations. The letters I, K stand for observa-\ntions ID 10408-01, 20402-01, respectively (B00). The third column\nindicates which state spectra were extracted from the data.\nObservation ID Class State\nK-44-00 \u03b2 A, B, C\nK-45-03 \u03b2 A, B, C\nK-45-02 \u03b8 A, B\nI-38-00 \u03bb B\nK-05-00 \u03c72 C\nI-42-00 \u03c74 C\nthe color temperature correction constant with radius and con-\nvolves them with the transfer function describing photon prop-\nagation, as computed by Laor (1991). We fix the black hole\nmass, source distance and accretion disk inclination at the val-\nues indicated above, and allow only the inner radius of the disk\n(in units of Rg \u0011 GM\/c2) and the mass accretion rate, M\u02d9 to\nbe free parameters. In particular, the model does not have an\nadditional free normalization.\nThe Comptonized component will be described by the\nthComp model, based on a solution of the Kompaneets equation\n(Zdziarski et al. 1996), or by the compPS model of Poutanen &\nSvensson (1996). The latter does not assume the di\u000busion ap-\nproximation but solves for each scattering order independently.\nThe compPS model can be used with purely thermal, purely\nnon-thermal or a hybrid electron energy distribution (Coppi\n1999). The seed photons will be assumed to have a disk black-\nbody spectrum and the comptonizing cloud is assumed to be a\nsphere. The code also consistently computes the un-scattered\nfraction of seed photons.\nFor the X-ray reprocessed component we will use the\nrelrepr model (Z\u02d9ycki et al. 2001), combining the Compton-\nreflected continuum (Magdziarz & Zdziarski 1995; Done et al.\n1992) with the Fe K\u03b1 line computations of Z\u02d9ycki & Czerny\n(1994). The model computes self-consistently the strength of\nthe line for a given primary continuum spectrum, amplitude\nof the Compton-reflected component, R, ionization parameter,\n\u03be = 4piFX\/n, and Fe abundance, and it also allows for rela-\ntivistic e\u000bects to be applied to both components (using the pre-\nscription from Fabian et al. 1989). The amplitude R is defined\nas \u2126\/(2pi), where \u2126 is the solid angle subtended by the repro-\ncessor from the X\u2013ray source.\n4. Results\n4.1. State B spectra\nWe begin our analysis with the brightest state, B. First, we try\nmodeling the soft part of the spectrum with disk blackbody,\nand the hard one with non-thermal Comptonization (we apply\ncompPS model to the data). The latter is motivated by the re-\nports, where the source spectrum in state B and C was found to\nextend to \u0015600 keV without a break or cuto\u000b (Zdziarski et al.\n2001). We assume that the seed photons for Comptonization\nhave the same disk blackbody shape and temperature. The re-\nprocessed component is also included in the model. This model\ngives unacceptable fits, \u03c72\u03bd \u0018 2, with residuals up to 10 per cent\nM. A. Sobolewska and P. T. Z\u02d9ycki: X\u2013ray modeling of GRS 1915+105 555\nTable 2.

A good description of the data is pro-\nvided by models including a more complex shape of the soft\ncomponent. Motivated by earlier results (see Z\u02d9ycki et al. 2001;\nWilson & Done 2001 and references therein) we test two phe-\nnomenological descriptions of the soft component: (i) with an\nadditional Comptonized disk blackbody and (ii) an additional\nblackbody. (Note that a certain fraction of the seed disk black-\nbody photons always contributes to the soft component due to\nmodeling the hard part of the spectrum with compPS). Both\nthese complex models give significant improvement compared\nto Model 1, with best fits of comparable quality, as shown in\nTable 2 (Models 2 and 3).\nA possible physical reason for the complexity may be the\nrelativistic e\u000bects expected from an inclined accretion disk.\nTherefore we also try (iii) the KerrD model for the soft com-\nponent (with non-thermal compPS for the hard tail, as before).\nThe quality of the fits is similar for all three models (Model 4\nin Table 2). The relativistic e\u000bects are quite pronounced at the\nhigh inclination of the source, i \u0019 70\u000e (see Ebisawa et al.\n2001; Gierlin\u00b4ski et al. 2001), and the Doppler-boosted disk\nemission fits well the observed high energy cuto\u000b of the soft\ncomponent. In the best fit for K-44-00 the inner disk radius\nRin = 3.80+2.20\u22122.56 Rg, for i = 70\n\u000e and d = 12.5 kpc. With the\nmore recently determined i = 66\u000e and d = 11 kpc (Fender et al.\n1999) the inner radius is Rin = 2.25+1.0\u22121.01. In both cases Rin is\nconsistent with the last stable orbit at 1.24 Rg, and a large in-\nner hole in the disk is ruled out. A good fit (\u03c72\/\u03bd = 46.3\/72)\ncan be obtained with the disk emission model in Schwarzschild\nmetric, however a small mass of the black hole, M \u0019 4 M\f is\nrequired in this case, in order to account for the high observed\ndisk temperature. Thus, if the soft component is modeled as a\nrelativistic disk emission, a Kerr (rotating) black hole is implied\nby our result.\nWe note once again that some seed disk blackbody photons\ndo contribute to the soft component (Fig. 1) since the compPS\nmodel computes self-consistently the un-scattered fraction of\nthe seed photon flux. Without this component the fit is worse by\n\u0001\u03c72 = 21 (for K-44-00), therefore we stress that the relativistic\ne\u000bects may not be the only factor contributing to the complex-\nity of the soft component. However, given the high inclination\nof the accretion disc, their a priori importance is obvious. The\nmass accretion rate is 7.5\u00021018 g s\u22121 for K-44-00 data (Table 3;\nand up to 2.6 \u0002 1019 g s\u22121 for other data). We note that both M\u02d9\nand Rin would be di\u000berent for di\u000berent value of the black hole\nangular momentum (see discussion in Gierlin\u00b4ski et al. 2001; re-\ncall that a = 0.998 is assumed in our paper), thus our result can\nonly be regarded as a qualitative demonstration that relativistic\ne\u000bects can partially account for apparently complex soft com-\nponent in this spectral state.\nThe seed photon temperature for the non-thermal\nComptonization was a free parameter in these fits, but the best\nfit values are similar to the obtained maximum temperatures\nof the Kerr disk emission (\u00191.2 keV), as expected. The repro-\ncessed component from the non-thermal primary is present in\nthe data, with typical amplitude R = 0.7\u20131.0 (Table 3). Its pres-\nence is however not highly significant, since removing it we\nobtain fits worse by \u0001\u03c72 = 5.4\u20138.4. The best fit value of ion-\nization parameter is high, \u03be \u0018 104, as expected from a hot\naccretion disk, although the formal errors on \u03be are large. No\nfurther broadening of the reprocessed component is formally\nrequired by the data, although the data are consistent with rela-\ntivistic smearing from a disk extending down to \u001820 Rg. This is\nlarger than the inner radius of the emitting disk, indicating that\nthe innermost disk region is too hot to produce any significant\nspectral features. A part of the uncertainty in determining Rin\ncomes from the fact that Compton scattering in highly ionized\n556 M. A. Sobolewska and P. T. Z\u02d9ycki: X\u2013ray modeling of GRS 1915+105\nFig. 1.

Long-dashed curves are the comptonized component compPS with the transmitted\nseed photons, Short-dashed curves are the Kerr disk spectrum model, and the dash-dot curves are the reprocessed component. Complexity of\nthe soft component in states A and B is apparent and this cannot be accounted for by the Kerr disk model alone. There is only a weak disk\nthermal component in state C spectrum, but modeling it with the KerrD model suggests that the disk M\u02d9 may actually be comparable to or even\nhigher than in states A and B. However, the inner disk radius is larger than the last stable orbit, so most of the accretion power would not appear\nas thermal X\u2013ray emission.\nTable 3.

State A spectra\nState A is very similar to state B, although somewhat less lu-\nminous (B00). The presence of the non-thermal tail was not\nexplicitly demonstrated in this state, but given its similarity\nto state B, we assume the hard tail is indeed given by a non-\nthermal Comptonization and include it in all models. Initial fits\nwith the non-thermal compPS model give bad fits (\u03c72\u03bd \u0019 3\u20135).\nAgain, a complex shape of soft component helps to obtain\ngood fits, with comparable quality of fits for the various models\n(Table 2). The overall spectra are dominated by the strong soft\ncomponent, with the harder tail appearing only above \u001920 keV\n(Fig. 1; Table 3).\nThe model which includes the Kerr metric disk component\ngives a comparable fit quality to the other models with a com-\nplex soft component. Moreover, the unscattered photons con-\ntribute significantly to the soft component, broadening it com-\npared to what would be obtained with pure relativistic disk\nemission (Fig. 1). Removing the unscatered photons from the\nmodel gives clearly unacceptable fits (\u03c72\u03bd \u0018 3), i.e. the Kerr\ndisk component with pure non-thermal Comptonized compo-\nnent cannot describe the data. In one case (K-45-03) the best\noverall fit is obtained with the blackbody model while in an-\nother case (K-45-02) the Comptonized disk blackbody and the\nblackbody models provide the same quality of fits to the data.\nThe temperature of the additional blackbody is rather high,\n\u00182 keV. It appears that this component is used to adjust the cur-\nvature of the Comptonized spectrum rather than representing a\nreal spectral component. Clearly, relativistic e\u000bects from a Kerr\nmetric may be considered as contributing to the complexity of\nthe soft component in the case of the K-44-00 observation, but\nare not su\u000ecient to describe it completely.\nOther aspects of the best fit models are similar to state B\nspectra: the reprocessed component is present in the data, it\nis highly ionized and further smeared (again, with rather large\nerrors). An additional narrow gaussian line at 6.4 keV was also\nincluded in the model, since the fit residuals clearly indicated\nthe presence of such a line. Its equivalent width is \u001830 eV.\nFits of the KerrD model with the non-thermal tail give M\u02d9\nsystematically lower than those for state B, while Rin is the\nsame within the fit uncertainty (Table 3).\nM. A. Sobolewska and P. T. Z\u02d9ycki: X\u2013ray modeling of GRS 1915+105 557\n4.3. State C spectra\nState C is generally rather harder than either A and B, and the\ndisk component is less pronounced (B00). The non-thermal\ncompPS model gives adequate fits to the data (with our as-\nsumed systematic errors of 1%). The \u03c72\u03bd values for K-44-00,\nK-45-03, K-05-00, I-42-00 observations are \u03c72\u03bd = 1.14, 0.83,\n0.87 and 1.04, respectively (Table 2, model 1; Fig. 1).\nThe disk component can be separated from the total\nComptonization component as computed by compPS by set-\nting the un-scattered fraction of seed photons to 0, and mod-\neling the soft photons by a separate model. We perform such\na procedure for the K-44-00 and K-45-03 data sets, describing\nthe soft component by the KerrD model. Although it does not\nlead to satisfactory fits, it allows to approximate values of phys-\nical disk parameters, M\u02d9 and Rin. These are M\u02d9 \u0019 2 \u0002 1019 g s\u22121\nand Rin \u0019 15 Rg. The mass accretion rate is rather high, close to\nthe upper values for state B. The large inner radius means that\nthe maximum color temperature is \u00190.8 keV and most of the\ncorresponding luminosity is not seen in the X\u2013ray band.\nIn all data sets the reprocessed component is always sig-\nnificantly present. Its amplitude is smaller than 1, it is highly\nionized (\u03be \u0018 104, but with large errors). Additional broadening\nof the spectral features is also required. If this is interpreted as\nrelativistic, the inner radius of the reflecting disk is \u001825\u2013100 Rg\n(Table 3).\n5. Discussion\nOur analysis of RXTE data of the micro-quasar GRS 1915+105\nreveals all the spectral features typically found in high\/soft\nstates of accreting black holes (see Gierlin\u00b4ski et al. 1999; Z\u02d9ycki\net al. 2001; Zdziarski et al. 2001). The hard component is well\nfit by a non-thermal Comptonization, the soft component is\nusually complex, and the reprocessed component is present,\nhighly ionized and further broadened and smeared.\nA clear complex soft component is seen in the high lumi-\nnosity states A and B. A number of descriptions of the com-\nponent are possible: in addition to the usual disk thermal emis-\nsion, there may be contribution from hotter spots on the disk,\nheated by strong illumination by compact magnetic flares. This\nwould produce an additional blackbody emission, such as in\nour model 3. Alternatively, the hot upper layers of the heated\naccretion disk may additionally comptonize the soft photons\nfrom below, producing the second, low temperature comp-\ntonized component (see more detailed discussion in, e.g., Z\u02d9ycki\net al. 2001). However, the relativistic distortions expected from\nsuch a highly inclined accretion disk (i \u0019 70\u000e) are significant\nand they cannot be ignored. In particular Doppler blueshift\nand boosting make the observed temperature higher than the\ntrue color disk temperature. However, even assuming a max-\nimally rotating black hole, we need to include a contribution\nfrom additional soft photons, in order to explain the spectrum\nin both state A and B. Therefore, quantitative determinations\nof the black hole angular momentum are not possible without\nconstructing a more detailed geometrical model explaining the\norigin of all components. However, relativistic e\u000bects alone in\nSchwarzschild metric (a = 0) would not be able to account\nfor the high apparent peak energy of the soft component, if the\nmass of 14 M\f is adopted. In the interpretation of Zdziarski\net al. (2001) the high apparent peak energy is due to Compton\nupscattering by a relatively cool, optically thick plasma (see\nFig. 3b in their paper), but clearly the Comptonization parame-\nters will be changed if relativistic e\u000bects are taken into account\nin this description.\nIn state C we generally see strongly comptonized emission\nwith small contribution of soft seed photons. The parameters\nof the soft component correspond to larger inner disk radius\nthan in states A and B, confirming qualitatively previous stud-\nies of Belloni et al. (1997). We note however that quantitative\nestimates of e.g. the inner disk radius require proper decom-\nposition of spectra into the disk and Comptonized emission.\nModels used in many previous papers, i.e. diskbb and a power\nlaw are clearly inadequate for such a task. In particular a power\nlaw is not a proper description of a Comptonization process,\nif the seed photons are visible in the considered energy band,\nas is clearly the case in GRS 1915+105. Our modelling sug-\ngests inner radii \u001915 Rg. Since in a Kerr metric the dissipa-\ntion of gravitational energy is strongly concentrated towards\nthe center, therefore the total accretion power is implied to be\nmuch larger than that directly observed as an X\u2013ray emission.\nQuantitative estimates would require knowledge of the black\nhole spin, but even for a mild value, a = 0.5, the fraction of en-\nergy dissipated within 15 Rg is \u001980%. Total accretion power\nimplied would then not be di\u000berent in state C compared to\nstates A and B, but most of that power would be used to e.g.\ncause an ejection of plasma.\nAcknowledgements.
