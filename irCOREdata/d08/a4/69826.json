Dealing with refusals illustrates the dilemma faced by institutional \npersonnel in accepting choices which might disrupt the efficient management of the \nservice. \n \n                                                                                                               Saying no to staff\u2026. 1    \n 1\nSaying no to the staff: an analysis of refusals in a home for people with severe \ncommunication difficulties \nRecent government proposals on social exclusion and disability in the United \nKingdom stress that social care services should promote choice, control and \nempowerment (e.g. Department of Health, 2005; HM Government, 2005; Prime \nMinister\u2019s Strategy Unit, 2005; Social Exclusion Unit, 2005). These concerns accord \nwith the notion of person-centred support based on work emanating from the U.S.A. \n(e.g. O\u2019Brian & Lovett, 1993; O'Brien & Lyle O'Brien, 1988).  \nHowever, policy-makers also recognize that there are barriers to the promotion \nof empowerment in services. For example, the recent UK government report \nImproving the Life Chances of Disabled People (Prime Minister\u2019s Strategy Unit, \n2005) discusses two main barriers: supports are often not fitted to the individual, \nrather disabled people are expected to fit into existing services (for examples see \nBeamer & Brooks, 2001); and services tend to focus on incapacity, inability and risk, \nwith the result that dependency is created. Indeed, this report identifies a \u2018culture of \ncare and dependency\u2019 (p73) in health and social care services in the UK, in which \nthose with \u2018significant cognitive and\/or communication impairments are particularly \nat risk of being denied choice and control in their lives\u2019 (p78; see Hatton et al, 2004; \nKishi, Teelucksingh, Zollers, Park-Lee & Meyer, 1988, Stancliffe, Abery & Smith, \n2000,  for further evidence).  \nThe problems in translating policy goals of choice and autonomy into practice \nfor people with learning difficulties have been discussed by many commentators (e.g. \nBeamer & Brookes, 2001; Dowson, 1997; Edge, 2001; Guess, Benson & Siegel-\nCausey, 1985; Harris, 2003; Jenkinson, 1993; Jenkinson et al, 1992; Kishi et al, 1988; \nLovett, 1996; Stalker & Harris, 1998). Even with changes in the ways services are \ncommissioned and the types of services available, without a sensitive workforce these \nbroader values will not be achieved (Department of Health, 2005; Social Exclusion \nUnit, 2005). This is particularly the case for those with multiple, complex support \nneeds, who reports have identified as benefiting least from current policy initiatives in \nthe UK (HM Government, 2005; Learning Disability Task Force, 2004).  \nChoice and control are issues that arise in the way people talk to each other, in \nwhich utterances are taken up and which are ignored, in how and what options are \noffered, in how preferences are expressed, how information is presented, how spaces \nare opened up for people to express preferences and how spaces are shut down. While \n                                                                                                               Saying no to staff\u2026. 2    \n 2\nthis applies to all people with intellectual disabilities, the expression and recognition \nof preferences in everyday interactions are particularly important for people with \ncommunication difficulties, who may have restricted access to other sites in which \nthey might exercise control over their lives. However, detailed examination of how \nthis is done in recorded interaction between staff and people with intellectual \ndisabilities is rare (for examples of such research, see McConkey, Morris and Purcell, \n1999, and Authors reference). When it comes to interaction between staff and people \nwith severe communication difficulties, there is, so far as we know, no published \nanalysis of video records of routine care-home encounters (although see Houghton, \nBronicki & Guess, 1987, for a classroom observational study). \nThis paper seeks to remedy the lack by examining, in detail, one crucial aspect \nof choice in a residential service setting: the person's right to refuse. Refusing a \nmember of staff's invitation or instruction is a particularly sensitive issue, shot \nthrough with difficulties for both sides. Its sensitivities make it particularly vulnerable \nto contamination by the research method chosen. How staff respond to residents' \nrefusals is not likely to be easily captured in a questionnaire survey, nor will more \nqualitative forms of investigation - for example, interviews with staff, or questions to \nself-advocacy groups with residents - necessarily yield the detail we want. \nRetrospective accounts are undermined by memory loss, the desire to please the \ninterviewer, and a concern to tell a coherent (but possibly inaccurate) story.  \nThe most reliable data to study (especially when the events are complex) are \nvideo records, informed by ethnographic background. Analysis of video-recorded \ndetails of the actual exchange between staff member and resident is, we argue, \nnecessary to bring out the particular practices that are used (especially on the staff's \nside) to manage the balance between respecting the resident's rights, on the one hand, \nand pursuing the institution's legitimate goals on the other.  \n \nMethod \nOverview \nWe shall present a qualitative analysis of episodes of residents in a social care \nhome declining to take part in an activity put to them by staff. Because the \ninteractions are complex, and the analysis detailed, considerations of space limit us to \ntwo episodes that illustrate the wider theme. In each case the reader will see how a \nresident initially declines to take part in an activity, then how the staff treat this \n                                                                                                               Saying no to staff\u2026. 3    \n 3\nrefusal, pursue compliance, bring the episode to a conclusion, and put a positive gloss \non proceedings.  \n \nData \nThe examples presented here come from an ethnographic project which took \nplace in three residential services for people with intellectual disabilities. These three \nservices were located within an NHS Care Trust in the South of England. Over the \ncourse of nine months, a researcher (one of this article's authors, CW) collected video \nand audio recordings, and ethnographic field notes of everyday interactions in these \nhomes. The examples here were taken from one home for people with high support \nneeds in which even the most communicatively able residents only have recourse to \nvocabularies of a small number of intelligible words or signs. The residents are \ntherefore highly reliant on members of staff to interpret and act on the few words, \nsigns, sounds, gestures or facial expressions that they may use to express themselves \nor make their needs known. Further, many of the residents are reliant on staff for \naspects of intimate care, such as the promotion of continence. Thus, members of staff \nare institutionally compelled by their \u2018duty of care\u2019 to pursue and promote particular \npractices and activities at particular times of the day.  \nThe names of all residents and members of staff have been replaced with \npseudonyms, and any other information that might lead to their identification has been \nchanged.  \n \nMethod \nOur approach involves looking in detail at what happens in these situations, in \nparticular how each person designs their utterances, and how those utterances develop \nin sequence. In this respect our approach is broadly informed by Conversation \nAnalysis (for an overview of Conversation Analysis see Hutchby and Wooffitt, 1998, \nand for a comparison with other forms of discourse analysis, Wooffitt, 2005). Within \nthe field of research on intellectual disability, Conversation Analysis (henceforth, CA) \nhas been used to study the communicative competence of people with intellectual \ndisabilities (e.g. Wootton, 1989), the practices of clinical assessment and service \nevaluation (e.g. Authors refs), the management of service-user meetings (e.g. Authors \nrefs), the interactional production of \u2018incompetence\u2019 and \u2018acquiescence\u2019 (and \nresistance to this \u2013 Rapley, 2004) and the ways in which service-user identities are \n                                                                                                               Saying no to staff\u2026. 4    \n 4\nconnected to staff identities in case worker consultations (Wareing and Newell, 2005) \namong other topics. \nConversation Analysis permits us to inspect the very fine details of interaction, \nand thus provides us direct empirical  grounds for our claims.  This is important \nwhen the issue being studied is irredeemably local and interactional, as of course is \n'refusing' or 'resisting' (or its counterparts 'inviting', 'insisting' and so on). Our use of \nCA is bolstered by essential support from our ethnographic research on site. This is \ncrucial here, as the communication difficulties of the residents are so marked that \nspecial background is crucial to interpret what particular behaviours and vocalisations \nmight mean to the residents and staff. Thus, for example, one needs to know that a \nresident's apparently meaningful silence in response to a previous turn is accountable \nby their general inability to produce speech; or that a certain resident uses a certain \nvocalisation generally to signal distress or pain; and so on. \n \nAnalysis \nOne activity: being weighed \nWe have chosen two episodes within a single morning's activity (the residents' \nmonthly weigh-in), so as to reduce the ethnographic background information \nnecessary for the reader to understand the framework of what is going on. However, \neven though we focus on this one activity, what we shall see is in keeping with the \nroutine proposals and acceptance of\/resistance to other activities in this service. \n \nEthnographic background \nRecording residents' weight serves a monitoring function as an index of the \nresidents' health. It takes place monthly. During the daytime in this house, residents \nare usually occupied (or indeed sit or wander unoccupied) in the lounge or in other \nrooms. Weighing normally involves asking the residents firstly to come through to the \ndining room, or leading them into it, and then getting them to approach and step up \nonto a set of ordinary bathroom scales about two inches high.  That is what happens \non this occasion. \nWhile some of the residents come immediately for weighing, the recording \nshows that others appear reluctant and are encouraged repeatedly. A couple of \nresidents appear to be apprehensive about stepping up onto the scales, and only do so \nwhile holding onto the staff or the wall, suggesting that , for some at least, there may \n                                                                                                               Saying no to staff\u2026. 5    \n 5\nbe a problem of balance or a fear of falling. The episodes we examine here concern \nthe three staff on duty (one of whom is off-camera, in another room) and two \nresidents, Matthew and Steven, who each (in separate episodes) display obvious \nresistance to getting on the scales. We shall describe Matthew's case first.  \n \nCase 1. Matthew's refusal to be weighed, and how staff deal with it. \nWe join at the point where staff member Sandy ushers in residents Matthew and \nMona. They enter a room in which are visible two residents not apparently engaged in \nany specific activity; the researcher Chris, standing out of the way, camera in hand; \nand staff member Jill, who comes forward to receive them. Mona is slightly behind \nMatthew, who thus becomes first to be asked to take part in the activity. \nAt this point it is useful to record that Matthew is a 36 year-old man of small \nstature (a little over 4 feet tall). Matthew has a vocabulary supposed to number some \n20 words, though few of these are evident on a day-to-day basis. He also makes use of \nexpressive sounds and gestures, particularly in situations that he finds dissatisfying or \ndistressing.   \nBefore the first extract we should explain what the reader will see. In an effort \nto capture as much of the details of the speakers' delivery, and the timing, of their \nspeech and actions, we have used conventional CA notation. The full glossary is in an \nAppendix to this article, but it is worth explaining two features which, unfortunately, \nimpede easy reading, yet are crucial for understanding what is happening. One is the \nuse of descriptions in italics (e.g. back to camera, leans down to face Matthew) in an \nattempt to capture relevant parts of the visible scene. The other is the use of square \nbrackets ([) on adjacent lines to show that the material enclosed is done at the same \ntime. So, for example, in Extract 1, in the one second between Jill's two turns at \nspeech (lines 5 and 8), we see Sandy take Mona past Matthew towards the weighing \nscales.  \n \nExtract 1: VA5 min 1.59. Matthew's first refusal \n01     Jill     ((back to camera, leans down to face Matthew, holds   \n02 \u21921         out hand  towards him)) >\u2191dy'wanna get weighed?<    \n03            (.3) \n04     Matt   ((while turning away from Jill to face the table)) \u00b0nehr\u00b0 \n05     Jill     no:? \n06            [                       (1.0)                  ] \n                                                                                                               Saying no to staff\u2026. 6    \n 6\n07            [((Sandy takes Mona past Matthew towards scales)) ] \n08     Jill     go on then, (.2) Mona can go:, \n \nRefusal acknowledged and the matter dropped. \nStaff member Jill offers Matthew what will be the first of many invitations to be \nweighed (marked \"1\" in line 2). How does he react? Ethnographic observation \nprovides background evidence that Matthew's soft utterance at line 4, which we \ntranscribe as \"\u00b0nehr\u00b0\" is a sound that he uses elsewhere to signify a range of negatives \n- disagreement, distaste or, as we may understand it here, dissent.  \nBy itself this background information is only suggestive, and as CA theorists \nobserve, potentially misleading (see, for example, Schegloff, 1997, on the use of \nalleged background context). What is decisive is two immediate sources: Matthew's \nown turning away from Jill, which is a generally-shared convention requiring no \nspecial interpretation; and - most manifestly - Jill and Sandy's immediate \nunderstanding that Matthew means 'no'. Jill explicitly does a check-confirming \"no?\" \n(see Houtkoop-Steenstra, 2000 especially ch. 6 on how questioners deal with \nanswers), and Sandy endorses this understanding by beginning to lead the other \nresident past Matthew to take her turn. Jill concurs. \nThe immediate availability of the next resident allows the staff members to drop \nthe issue of Matthew's compliance. A period follows in which Mona is successfully \nweighed, without incident. Then another resident, Julie, appears and is brought to the \nscales and weighed, though with somewhat more trouble (which we shall not describe \nhere). Jill then turns to Matthew again.  \n \nExtract 2: VA5 min 3.05. Matthew's second refusal \n01     (?)

She asks: 'd'y wanna \nanother go'. This on the face of it is odd, as he has not 'had a go' yet, in the sense of \nmaking any attempt to approach, still less stand on, the scales. This is a no-blame \nrepair (repair, as a feature of conversation, has been studied since Sacks, Schegloff \nand Jefferson's seminal 1974 article on turn-taking in conversation) of Jill's initial \nquestion, which elides responsibility for the problem it caused. Indeed, it implies that \nthere was no problem, and that the request had been already partially successful, as if \nMatthew had in fact made a stab at mounting the scales. It is met with silence. Jill \nreissues it (\"3\", line 6), as if it had not been heard or understood; but no-blame \nformulation or not, this third invitation also fails. \nJill is then more direct, asking: \u2018Shall we get weighed?\u2019 (invitation 4, line 13). \nThe collective phrasing (\u2018we\u2019) implies the task is one they are both doing together, \nrather than being an individual matter of choice for Matthew. This is another no-\nblame repair, as it issues the invitation as if for the first time. It implies that the two \nprevious attempts have been simply misunderstood, or not heard, or been otherwise \ninoperative; no blame attaches to Matthew (or to Jill) for their failures. This is a \nregular feature of self-initiated repairs (which are the preferred form; see Schegloff, \n1992). However, Matthew still refuses (line 14). He repeats the \"nehr\" sound we \nnoted in Extract 1 above, and turns away from Jill to face the table. Better evidence \nthat what he says and does is taken as a refusal is made manifest by his interlocutors: \nJill expressly announces (to the room at large, but possibly for the researcher Chris's \nbenefit) \"we had a clear 'no' there\". Three no-blame reissues of the invitation to get \nweighed have failed. \n \n                                                                                                               Saying no to staff\u2026. 8    \n 8\nA dilemma for staff \nWhat, now, are the members of staff to do? On the one hand, they could accept \nMatthew's four refusals. That would be in the spirit of the overarching institutional \npolicy of encouraging and respecting choice, enshrined in this residential home's \nwritten '\"philosophy of care \" and at each level of authority above it, from the policies \nof the regional Trust to those of the national Department of Health. This seems to be \nthe line that Jill takes, as the extract below - which follows on immediately from the \none above - shows. \n \nExtract 3: VA5 min 3.10. Jill apparently respects Matthew's refusal \n22            (.3) \n23     Jill     [you don\u2019t have to.                         ] \n24            [((walks away from Matthew, towards scales))  ] \n25            (1.0) \n \nJill announces that Matthew need not be weighed, and seemingly walks away. \nHis choice of refusing an activity seems to be respected. \nHowever, while respectful of individual rights, the service staff are also subject \nto two forces that pull the other way. One is that they may consider it to be in the \nresidents' best interests to get weighed, so that any health-related fluctuations will be \nspotted. This, of course, generalises to any activity which the institution believes is \nsubject to health and safety issues; our ethnography reveals it in such activities as \ntoileting, food-preparation, and so on. The other consideration that the staff may have \nin mind is that they personally, as employees, will be held accountable for a missing \nentry in the records. If either of these forces hold sway, the staff may feel entitled to \nmobilize a commonplace practice, often seen in this (and other) residences: to treat \nMatthew's 'refusal' as a merely temporary reluctance that will melt under persuasion \nand good-natured cajoling. It is this latter practice than wins out in this case. See how, \nin extract 4 below (which carries on immediately from extract 3), Jill breathes new \nlife into Matthew's weighing. \n \nExtract 4: VA5 min 3.12. Jill revives the invitation with a minimised task \n26     Jill     ((off camera)) what I will do is= \n27     Chris   ='e's gorris eye on it (.) \u00b0though\u00b0= \n28     Jill     [= try seeing (1.2)  if (2.4)                  ] \n29     Sandy  [((approaches him and holds her hand out))    ] \n                                                                                                               Saying no to staff\u2026. 9    \n 9\n30 \u21925        [you wannu go there (\u00b0'n    \u00b0)                ] \n31            [((Jill brings scales over to Matthew and places ]  \n32            [them at his feet))                          ] \n33            [((Matthew slowly turns 90\u00b0 away from Jill))   ] \n34     Jill     \u2191d'you want to step on 'em?                         \n            \nMinimised task \nDespite herself explicitly announcing that Matthew need not be weighed, Jill \nsuggests there is some room for interpretation. Her \u2018What I will do\" (line 26) proposes \nanother course of action to pursue her request, implying - again in a formulation that \ndoes not blame Matthew - that the fault may have been in the difficulty of what was \noriginally wanted. Chris the researcher seems to endorse the possibility that \nMatthew\u2019s no was not definitive by saying \u2018He\u2019s got his eye on it (i.e. the set of \nscales), though.\u2019  \nJill goes to get the scales, implying that it was the distance (a few feet) that was \nthe problem. Sandy takes her cue from Jill's actions by explicitly approaching \nMatthew with her hand outstretched (as if to help him onto the scales) and issuing a \ndirect invitation (marked \"5\", line 30). Jill arrives with the scales and places them at \nMatthew's feet. She then issues the sixth invitation: \"d'you want to step on them?\" \n(line 34). Extract 5 follows immediately. \n \nExtract 5: VA5 min 3.19.

Matthew \nrepeats the nehr sound and shuffles his feet away from the scales. Jill echoes this as a \nconventional no refusal, and removes the scales (lines 40-2). In line 47 she says \u2018Ok\u2019 \nwhich is commonly used to as a pivot between topics (Beach 1995) and reiterates her \nunderstanding that Matthew\u2019s behaviour constituted a refusal (line 51). Chris, the \nresearcher, goes along with this proposed termination of the issue, making operative \nthe new, but institutionally relevant (and business-as-usual) topic of next-to-be-\nweighed. \n \nSummary of staff's treatment of Matthew's refusals so far. \nAt this point we can see that Matthew has given multiple signs that he does not \nwant to take part in the activity. Apart from his non-standard vocalisation, he has \nturned his body away from the direction of the scales, looked away, not taken a hand \noffered to him, and not stepped onto (indeed, edged away from) the scales when they \nwere brought to him. We have also seen that although these behaviours are recognized \n(indeed explicitly announced) to be refusals, the staff persist in their requests, \nindicating that Matthew's refusals are not treated as definitive.  \nHowever, neither Jill nor Sandy are ordering Matthew to get on the scales, or \ninvoking their authority as staff members. They are solving their dilemma (between \nrespect and persistence) by no-blame encouragement \u2013 their responses treat \nMatthew\u2019s refusal as either due to lack of support or encouragement on their part, or \ndue to problems in the way they have issued the invitation.  \nJill's \"okay\", and the move to next-resident-in-the-queue, suggests that \nMatthew's part in the episode is over. However, although Sandy and Jill have now \nmoved out of the room, we hear Rose, who has been in the kitchen, make an \nintervention. Extract six follows some 20 seconds on from extract five (the line \nnumbers give an indication of how much material we have skipped). \n \nExtract 6: VA5 min 3.31.

Matthew makes his way to a cabinet which houses videotapes, which the \nethnographic record shows are among Matthew's favourite objects. In other words, he \nlooks to initiate a quite different activity, under his own steam. Matthew is about to \ntouch the cabinet when Rose calls his name. He freezes. In contrast to Jill and Sandy, \nRose opens with an utterance from a different register. At line 75 (marked 7) Rose \nissues the direct order: \u201c(g)won stand on thee- scale\u201d. In response, Matthews turns \naway from the scales and says \u201cNeaah\u201d. Rose counters this with a disaffiliative, \nchallenging \"yes\u201d (line 80 below, marked 8). Clearly, Rose is dealing with Matthew's \nrefusal very differently. She is upgrading Jill and Sandy's no-blame invitations - \ninsistent as they were - to an unambiguous instruction. Matthew covers his face and \nrepeats \"neeah\u201d (line 81). \n \nExtract 7: VA5 min 3.56.

Her attempts to get Matthew to comply are more brusque than Sandy or \nJill \u2013 she raises her voice in line 83, directly counters Matthew\u2019s vocalisations with \nher own \u2018Yes\u2019, and then re-issues the order \u2018Go on, stand on the scales\u2019 (marked 9 & \n10). When Matthew still says \u2018nee:aurh\u2019 and moves away from the scales (lines 90 & \n91), she explicitly acknowledges her own will to be different from his own: \u2018I say yes\u2019 \n(marked 11, line 92). Each of these steps is characteristic of the escalation of \nargument (see Antaki, 1994, Dersley & Wootton, 2001). The result of this approach is \nwhat we might see as a more extreme display of refusal by Matthew \u2013 he withdraws, \nto go and stand facing the wall (lines 98 & 99).  \nThe conflict is unresolved, but fades as Jill and Sandy return with another \nresident. We hear no more from Rose. A little over a minute passes as they weigh this \nother resident, then seat him in a chair nearby. We rejoin the scene as Sandy \napproaches Matthew, who has been standing square-on to the wall the whole time, \nthough with head turned to follow the action.  \n \nBodily persuasion as a last resort  \nFor reasons of space we do not transcribe this stretch of action (a transcript is, \nhowever, available from the authors). Briefly, Matthew is facing the wall throughout. \nSandy brings the scale next to his feet, puts her arms around him. As she gently tries \nto manoeuvre him onto the scales, Matthew makes distressed-sounding vocalisations. \nSandy repeatedly says \u2018come on\u2019 in a sing-song voice, the intonation of which seems \ndesigned to respond to Matthew\u2019s \u2013 while he is making crying noises after her \ninvitations, she uses a lilting, soothing intonation pattern (see Rapley, 2004 for a \ndiscussion on workers using sing song intonations to people with intellectual \ndisabilities).  \nThis description shows two contradictory things: Sandy\u2019s gentle encircling of \nMatthew with her arms, and her soothing pitch might be heard as indicating her \nsupport for Matthew and a visible indication that she has heard his distress; on the \n                                                                                                               Saying no to staff\u2026. 13 \n   \n 13\nother hand, her persistence in the face of this points to a refusal to accept his response. \nAgain, at the end of the extract, Matthew adopts a more extreme response \u2013 he pulls \naway from her and faces the wall, leaning his forehead against it. This position is \nuncompromising. \n \nCoda: a positive gloss \nAt this point, the staff bring in and weigh another resident, so their business \nwith Matthew seems finally to be over. But it is not, quite. There is a revealing coda \nwhich brings out an important resource the staff have of explaining away problems by \nappeal to a quirk of Matthew\u2019s personality. We pick up the story about half a minute \nafter the end of the last extract. The staff's focus has been on another resident. We join \njust after Sandy has loudly, but indecipherably, addressed her colleague in the next \nroom, then starts to move off.  \n \nExtract 8: VA5 min 6.48. Sandy finds another activity for Matthew \n01    Sandy  (                    ) ((said loudly, but not clearly.  \n02           Possibly designed for a listener in another room; there  \n03           is a faint reply, possibly from Jill, off-screen)) \n04    Sandy  ((about to move past Matthew)) (           ) \n05    Sandy  ((stands in front of Matthew and looks at him)) hmm? \n06            (.5) \n07    Sandy  come on let's go.

In a signal that that \nbusiness is now over, she is inviting him to leave the dining room with her. In this \nextract we see that Sandy\u2019s initial invitation \u2018come on let\u2019s go\u2019 (line 7) is not \nresponded to. She then goes to stand in doorway and we can see she treats Matthew\u2019s \nnon-response as a \u2018no\u2019 by saying \u2018you\u2019re not coming\u2019 and \u2018all right, see you later\u2019. \nHowever, just as we have seen in previous extracts, this does not lead to the invitation \nbeing dropped, and she repeats \u2018come on\u2019 twice after this. Chris picks this up, and in \nline 26 Matthew begins to respond. So far, that merely repeats the pattern we have \nalready established. What is especially revealing about the extract is what Sandy now \nsays in lines 27-8, as an explanation of Matthew's tardiness in accepting her invitation \nto leave the room: \u2018you have to wait for your own time to come\u2019 (marked 14, lines 27 \n& 28).  \nWe would suggest that what Sandy is mobilising is a rhetorical trope which puts \na positive gloss on Matthew's behaviour - and on the staff's reaction to it. It claims \nthat Matthew's 'refusals' are (merely) signs of his well-known, universal and long-\nstanding disposition to want to do things at his own pace.  Sandy makes this as a \ncomment on his reluctance to leave the room, but it comes hard on the heels of the \nprotracted, and unconsummated, business of his failure to be weighed, and might \ntherefore be applicable to both. In both cases, what will have looked like \"refusing\" \nmight therefore be treated as a matter of him just wanting to \" wait for his own time\" \nto agree. This formulation, is, as Holt and Drew (1998) notice about such idioms, \ndesigned to bring a trouble to a conclusion by setting it down to an immutable and \nunchallengeable description of the way the world is.  \n \nCase 2. Steven's refusal to be weighed, and how staff deal with it.  \nMatthew's many refusals were dealt with in a variety of ways by staff; we now \nmove on to the case of another resident, Steven, to pick up similarities and \ndifferences. Steven is registered blind and has his eyes shut most of the time. Because \nof his lack of vision Steven requires physical assistance to move around the house. He \nis more verbally capable than Matthew; his vocabulary is greater and he is able to \nconstruct phrases several words in length. However, like Matthew his communicative \n                                                                                                               Saying no to staff\u2026. 15 \n   \n 15\nabilities are not readily apparent on a day-to-day basis and typically they only become \napparent when he is prompted and supported to use them. \nAt the start of extract 9 below, Sandy and Matthew are in the kitchen when Jill \nand Steven appear in the doorway, arms linked. Sandy is behind them.  \n \nExtract 9: VA5 min. 6.19. Steven stops (refuses?) in dining room doorway        \n01     Jill      say hello Chri::s               \n02     Sandy   Oh [:: \n03     Chris       [Oh and Steven as well (.) \u2191hi Steven  \n04     Steven   ((halts in doorway)) \n05     Jill      ((also stops, looking back at him))  \n06     Jill      whereyu going?

((they disappear from shot)) \n      \n                                                                                                               Saying no to staff\u2026. 16 \n   \n 16\nRepair to a more minimal request \nWe see in the extract above, as we did with Matthew, how the staff come to \nreissue the invitation in a more minimal form. When Steven halts in the doorway (line \n4), this might be a refusal. Jill treats it as (merely) a change of direction by asking \nwhere he wants to go, then repeats her invitation. Possibly recognizing potential \ntrouble, she prefaces the weighing invitation with offering him a drink (\u2018drink and \nweighed\u2019 \u2013 lines 7 and 11, marked 1 and 2), as if the two activities are coupled. \nHowever, Steven then turns and faces the doorframe (line 15). Rather than \nrecognizing this as his refusal, she re-issues the invitation, this time editing out the \nactivity (weighing) and offering a general invitation to enter the room: \u2018d\u2019yu wantu \ncome in?\u2019 (line 15). Faced with no clear acceptance of this invitation (there follows a \nsilence for 2.5 seconds; this is very indicative of a dispreferred, in conventional \nmetrics of pausing - see Jefferson, 1988), Jill then issues a call for his attention (his \nname with a questioning intonation \u2013 marked 3, line 15). As we saw with Matthew, \nthis way of dealing with refusals is a no-blame repair; it formulates his non-response \nas due to a lack of attention to her question rather than his declining the invitation \nAt line 16, Steven turns and once more faces into the kitchen. Jill treats his shift \nin body orientation as an opportunity to proceed further. She advances a few steps, \nholding Steven\u2019s hand and leading him into the room, saying \u2018come on\u2019 (line 21). \nThis change in Steven\u2019s bodily position can be seen, then, as potentially interpretable \nas a change in his attitude towards entering the room. Like the sequence in extract 9, it \nis precisely these types of events which provide licence for staff persistence, since \nthey indicate that refusals might not always be definitive.  \nHowever, Steven then stops and brings his open palm to his mouth (as if he \nwere biting himself \u2013 line 22). Jill\u2019s \u2018no\u2019 at this point might be a request for him not to \nbite his hand, or she might be voicing her interpretation of his behaviour (i.e. he does \nnot want to go into the kitchen). Steven then pulls his hand from hers, turns away \nfrom Jill and the kitchen, and steps back to the doorway. At line 30 (marked 4) Jill \nclearly treats Steven as refusing (\u2018we\u2019ve got a clear no here\u2019; c.f. the same \nannouncement about Matthew, Extract 2, line 16)), and she stops trying to get him \nweighed by asking him where he wants to go. Steven provides a verbal response \nwhich we were unable to hear clearly on the recording, but which Jill\u2019s takes to be \n\u2018front room\u2019 (a term used in the UK to refer to the \u2018lounge\u2019 or \u2018sitting room\u2019). They \nthen leave the kitchen, and we can see that Steven\u2019s choice has been respected. \n                                                                                                               Saying no to staff\u2026. 17 \n   \n 17\nHowever, as with Matthew's case, what seems to be a respectful conclusion is \nonly a temporary hiatus. We pick up the action with extract 11. Here we see Sandy \ntrying to weigh David. The scene begins about one minute after Steven has left the \nkitchen at the end of extract 10. Sandy comes out of lounge with Steven, holding his \nhand and walking with him towards the kitchen. Matthew passes them. Jill is standing \nin the corridor.  \n \nExtract 11: VA5 min 7.50. Steven is led back to the kitchen. \n 01     Sandy   d\u2019you wanna be weighed darling (.)  mh? \n 02             [                    (1.7)                          ] \n 03             [((Sandy leads Steven down corridor towards kitchen))   ] \n 04 \u21925 Jill      that\u2019s as far\u2019s I gottim  \n 05     Sandy   [                   (1.4)                           ]  \n 06             [((Sandy leads Steven down corridor towards kitchen))   ] \n 07     Jill      Matthew\u2019s runnin away \n 08     Sandy   mkay \n 09             [                    (4.0)                          ] \n 10             [((Sandy still leading Steven along, Jill follows))        ] \n 11             ((Steven stops  [ on threshold of kitchen and backs away)) \n 12                           [((Sandy stops, turns back))  \n 13     Sandy                [(    ) [(giggles) \n 14     Jill                         [see what I mean \n 15     Steve    [((backs out of doorway into corridor)) \n 16     Sandy    ((holding Steven\u2019s hand, points at floor by Steven\u2019s  \n 17              feet)) put the weigh .hhh put the scale there (.4) then, \n 18     Jill      [ss get you (down) \n 19             [((Jill walks past Sandy into kitchen)) \n 20     Sandy   [we'll put the scale here \n 21                          2.0 \n 22     Sandy   why don't you wanna be weighed       \n  \nReformulation of \u2018refusal\u2019 \nIn the first instance it was Jill who was taking the lead in trying to persuade \nSteven to get on the scales. A minute later, Sandy has a go, and it may be that she is \nmore successful. We pick up the scene as she is leading him down the corridor back \nto the dining-room: 'd\u2019you wanna be weighed darling' (line 1). That staff effectiveness \nis an issue is evidenced by Jill\u2019s comment, as they walk down the corridor, \u2018that\u2019s as \nfar as I got him\u2019 (marked 5, line 4). This way of construing the situation is one which \nplaces staff success or failure at getting the task done as central, rather than their \nsuccess at recognizing Steven\u2019s expression of preference. \n                                                                                                               Saying no to staff\u2026. 18 \n   \n 18\nAgain we see Steven doing things that staff interpret as expressing his desire not \nto be weighed. He pulls back in the doorway and edges back into the corridor. Sandy \nthen suggests bringing the scales from the kitchen and putting them at his feet. Just as \nwith Matthew (extract 4), this attempt to solve the problem treats his behaviour as \n(possibly) a refusal to go into the kitchen, or to walk the extra steps to the scales, \nrather than to get weighed per se. However, her next question \u2018why don't you wanna \nbe weighed\u2019 (line 22) treats his behaviour as a refusal to get on the scales. Note that \nthis is not a question that Steven would normally be able to answer given his \ncommunicative difficulties, but rather is one which fills the gap when Jill is getting \nthe scales, and one which credits Steven with reasons for his refusal. In a further \ndevelopment (not shown), Jill persists (\u2018mm? \u2026 come on\u2019) and Steven makes a \nmuffled shrieking noise, moving further away again. In response to this, Sandy drops \nher enquiries about being weighed and suggests a different activity \u2013 singing. This \nmight be glossed as a distraction sequence, since it occurs while Jill is fetching the \nscales and they are about to try to weigh him again (extract 12).  \n \nExtract 12: VA5 min 8.17.  Steven is almost manoeuvred onto the scales \n35      Jill      don\u2019t think [he will t\u2019be honest \n36                        [((Jill returns holding scales)) he feels un (.9) \n37              ((puts scales down in doorway by Steven\u2019s feet)) \n38      Jill      [safe \n39\u21926   Steven   [EUUoo:.hh ((shriek with open palm covering mouth)) \n40              ((drops hands to chest-height when vocalisation stops)) \n41      Jill      [Steven? \n42      Sandy   [t\u2019s allright, \n43\u21927           [((Sandy hands on Steven\u2019s waist, she moves his body round \n44              so he is facing kitchen and scales)) \n45      Steven   eeyooo:: \n46\u21927   Jill        >Come on sweetheart< (( takes Steven\u2019s wrist))   \n47      Jill      [can you step on here?  \n48      Steven   [\u00baeeyoo\u00ba \n49      Jill      step [up \n50      Steven        [\u00baoo\u00ba ((edging towards scale, hands clasped together,  \n51               Sandy\u2019s arms around his back, Jill holding his hand)) \n52      Sandy   step up \n53               ((Steven puts right foot on scales)) \n54\u21928    Jill      [well do::ne \n55\u21928    Sandy   [good ma::n \n56              ((Steven raises left foot into air)) \n57      Jill      now  [step up \n58      Sandy        [step up \n                                                                                                               Saying no to staff\u2026. 19 \n   \n 19\n59                    [((Steven has one foot on scales, other foot waving in air,  \n60              Sandy supporting.

This is a different explanation from those implied in the previous extract \n(that it was an issue of staff effectiveness or a problem with entering the dining room), \nand one which suggests Sandy will not be successful. Almost simultaneously, Steven \nmakes a loud shriek (marked 6, line 39). Both staff treat this as a sign of distress and \nadopt a soothing tone towards him, saying \u2018Steven\u2019 and \u2018that\u2019s allright\u2019 in light, sing-\nsong voices.  \n \nBodily movement again used as a last resort  \nHowever, rather than orienting to his shriek as a reaction to their continued \nencouragement of him to get on the scales, they simultaneously manoeuvre his body \naround towards the scales (marked 7, lines 43 and 46), and gently encourage him to \nget on them. His compliance is rewarded by praise in lines 54 and 55 (marked 8), and \nby the end of the extract he has one foot on the scales and one foot in the air, his body \nsupported by both Jill and Sandy. The weighing seems to have been successful. \n \nCoda \nJust as it looks as though their persistence has been rewarded, Steven moves his \nfirst foot off and slowly drops to floor, with Jill supporting him under his arms. Again \nto save space in this article, we describe this stretch rather than present the full \ntranscript (which is available from the authors). \nRather than putting both feet on the scales, Steven drops to the ground, and ends \nup sitting on the scales with his legs outstretched on the floor. Both staff laugh, and \nalthough Jill then reads the scales, calling out \"five stones\", the researcher Chris \nobserves \u2018that doesn\u2019t work\u2019 (i.e. it is likely be a highly inaccurate reading). \nNevertheless, rather than take issue with Steven\u2019s continued refusal to be weighed, Jill \npraises him for what she thinks he is doing on the scales: pretending to drive, and they \nboth give him physical reassurance by stroking or patting him. When they invite him \nto stand up again, he produces a vocalisation Jill is unable to interpret (\u2018what \n                                                                                                               Saying no to staff\u2026. 20 \n   \n 20\ndarling?), but which sounds on the tape like \u2018I don\u2019t\u2019. Steven might be indicating here \nthat he does not want to stand up - this interpretation is supported by the fact that he \nmakes no move to get up when encouraged, and begins to sing while rocking back \nand forth. Both Jill and Sandy take up his change of activity, laughing, clapping and \njoining in. After the singing is over, they help him up and back to the lounge without \ntrying to get him back on the scales again. His successful refusal, and creative change \nof activity, is accepted by both Jill and Sandy. Their praise at the end displays, to all \nparties, that Steven\u2019s exercise of choice has been accepted with good humour and \nwithout damaging their relations with him. \n \nDiscussion \nRefusing staff requests is a test of the staff and the system, as it puts in conflict \ntwo opposing institutional objectives: to respect choice and to get the job done. We \nset out in this article to use video records to examine, for the first time, what happened \non two occasions when residents with severe communication difficulties tried to \nrefuse an activity proposed to them by staff.  \nWe have, we think, achieved two things. The first is that we have put flesh on \nthe observation that it can be hard to for people who have little symbolic language to \nexercise choice in routine aspects of their lives. The second is to have revealed the \ndetailed work-practices by which staff members - usually sympathetically and \nunaggressively, but not always - override residents' refusals. In our examples, \nalthough the staff repeatedly recognized that residents preferred not to be weighed, \nand that it was not necessary, nevertheless they persisted in encouraging them. These \nscenes starkly show the conflict between two service agendas \u2013 that of encouraging \nself-determination and empowerment through offering support in \u2018person-centred\u2019 \nways, and that of providing \u2018care\u2019 through a set of routine institutional procedures (for \ndiscussions of this conflict see Bannerman et al, 1990; Dowson, 1997; Harris, 2003; \nJenkinson, 1993; Jenkinson et al, 1992; Kishi et al, 1988; Stancliffe, Abery & Smith, \n2000). We see here that although the former is recognized and acknowledged by the \nstaff, the latter seems often to dictate their responses. Indeed it takes some persistence \nand creativity on the part of residents Steven and Matthew before they find their \nwishes finally respected (and we must acknowledge that eventually the staff do \nrespect their choices). Neither was successfully weighed on the morning in question.  \n                                                                                                               Saying no to staff\u2026. 21 \n   \n 21\nWhile in some contexts it might be argued that the staff members are persisting \nto ensure the safety or health of the resident, we believe this is not the case in the \nexamples presented here. There is no life-or-death issue at stake in insisting that every \nresident participates in the weighing session, and this is acknowledged by the staff. \nRather, we believe the activities being insisted upon are being pursued for the sake of \ngetting all residents \u2018done\u2019 at the same time, in pursuit of a tidy schedule of work \nactivities, and because these interactions are locations for the demonstration and \ninstantiation of staff effectiveness and authority. The institutional imperative trumps \nthe residents' exercise of choice. \nThe extracts illustrate a range of resources on the part of residents that staff \nrecognize as refusals: edging one\u2019s feet away from an activity, stopping in the \ndoorway of the room in which the activity will occur, turning one\u2019s head away, \nstanding facing the wall, standing still when encouraged to approach a piece of \nequipment, the use of \u2018proto-words\u2019 such as Mathew\u2019s \u2018nehr'\/'neeyah\u2019, and \nvocalisations such as shrieks. In response to these, staff have a range of resources with \nwhich they attempt to counter these refusals: appreciating resident's behaviour as \nsomething other than refusal; formulating the invitation again in a no-blame format; \nminimising the task required; escalating the invitation to a request and an order (with \ngentle 'sing-song' intonation, or more brusquely); moving the person bodily; and \npositively glossing the proceedings. We should note the gentle way in which the staff \nalmost always acted, and that when they did accept the refusal, they did so in a \u2018no-\nblame\u2019 way \u2013 for example, stroking Matthew's back and shoulder (indicating their \nrelationship was still intact) and celebrating and joining in the Steven's creative \nresponse of treating the scales as a horse and singing an appropriate song. The drive to \nmaintain intersubjectivity (Garfinkel, 1967) - an agreed, positive, display of \nunderstanding what is going on - is as strong in this residential home as it is anywhere \nin social life. \nIt is important to set these extracts in the context of other sorts of invitations that \noccur in the house. Our ethnographic work, over some nine months, revealed similar \nbehaviour in a range of situations in which residents are being invited to do things \n(e.g. go to the toilet, go to the dining room for a meal). On some occasions, the \nresident simply does not respond \u2013 that is they make no vocalisation or movement that \nis easily interpretable as an acceptance or refusal, although a non-response might be \ntaken to indicate a refusal. However, in these situations the staff usually persist in \n                                                                                                               Saying no to staff\u2026. 22 \n   \n 22\ntheir encouragement, and eventually the resident might comply. We saw this where \nMathew is invited to leave the kitchen by Sandy. Since this means that non-responses \ncan sometimes be ambiguous, or that residents can change their minds after some \nencouragement, this gives a certain licence for staff to persist when initial invitations \ndo not appear to be accepted. In the extracts above, however, what we see are staff \nacknowledging that the person has said no, yet still persisting. \nIn conclusion: we have examined in detail two episodes in which people with \nsevere communication difficulties attempt to refuse care activities suggested by staff. \nEmpirical studies which seek to understand and promote self-determination have \ntended to focus on broad indices of choice in such things as food, leisure activities and \nliving arrangements (eg Hatton et al, 2004; Stancliffe 1995, 1997; Stancliffe & Abery, \n1997; Stancliffe et al, 2000), or on developing techniques to teach people choice-\nmaking skills (eg Browder, Cooper & Lim, 1998; Cooper & Browder, 1998; Nozaki \n& Mochizuki, 1995). This paper documents what we can learn about the abstractions \nof empowerment and disempowerment as they cash out in lived experience. \n \nReferences \n[NB authors' references are not included in this submission draft] \nAntaki, C., 1994, Explaining and Arguing: The social organisation of accounts, London: \nSage \nBannerman, D.J., Sheldon, J.B., Sherman, J.A. & Harchik, A.E.
