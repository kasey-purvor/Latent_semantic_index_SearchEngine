INTRODUCTION\nRESONANT power converters offer a higher efficiency andreduced size compared with traditional switched-mode\ncounterparts. Thus, there is significant interest in high-order\nresonant systems, such as that shown in Fig. 1, particularly\nin the consumer product industry, to satisfy the requirement\nfor smaller power supplies for compact electronic equipment.\nHowever, the increased circuit complexity makes it more\ndifficult to accurately predict the performance of the converters\nduring an iterative design process, due to the protracted\nsimulation times required for component-based simulation\npackages, such as Spice. Computationally efficient algorithms\nare, therefore, sought to accurately predict current and voltage\nwaveforms throughout such converters, so as to facilitate their\ndesign.\nUtilizing state-variable models, and exploiting the periodic\nbehavior of resonant converters in the steady-state, cyclic-aver-\naging techniques will be shown to provide an attractive alter-\nnative to traditional \u2018integration-based\u2019 and harmonic analysis\nmethods for converter performance evaluation, and component\nstress prediction.\nManuscript received February 8, 2002; revised March 3, 2003.

MODELLING CYCLIC BEHAVIOUR\nThe proposed approach is considered to be a variant of\nFloquet-based techniques, [1], whereby averaged, steady-state\nvalues of state-variables are determined. Due to the multiple\noperating modes of resonant converters, Fig. 2, \u201cclassical\u201d\nsteady-state operating points cannot be determined due to the\ncontinuous switching nature of the input voltage. However, by\nconsidering converter operation to be periodic, then\n(1)\nwhere the state vector, , describing converter operation at time\nis equal to the state vector at time , being the pe-\nriod of the applied input voltage and an integer. The resulting\nperformance of the converter can then be obtained from ana-\nlytical equations without the need for integration. The method\ncan, thereby, provide steady-state performance predictions ex-\ntremely rapidly.\nIn the steady-state, each period of a cycle can be decom-\nposed into multiple operating modes, each dependent on the\nstate of the input voltage and the rectifier input\/output volt-\nages and currents. Fig. 2 shows typical steady-state voltage and\ncurrent waveforms for the resonant converter circuit shown in\nFig. 1, together with the sub-division of the cycle into operating\nmodes, .\nIn general, power converters operating in a cyclic-mode\ncan be modeled by a system of piecewise linear (state-space)\nequations which describe the converter in each operating mode\nduring the cycle; i.e.\n(2)\nwhere is the state vector, is the dynamical matrix and\nis the input vector, in the operating mode of the converter.\nThus, they consist of a linear combination of circuit voltages\nand currents. For the mode, (2) can be solved analytically\n(3)\nwhere , , and\nare the initial conditions for the mode. If the time during\nwhich the circuit operates in the mode is , where is the\nassociated duty-cycle, the complete solution for the dynamics of\nthe converter can be obtained by employing the state vector at\ntime as the initial condition for the subsequent dynamics\nof the mode. Nevertheless, the solution of (3) is com-\nplicated by the need to evaluate the integral, which is a major\ncontribution to the computational overhead when analyzing the\n0885-8993\/03$17.00 \u00a9 2003 IEEE\n986 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS, VOL. 18, NO. 4,JULY 2003\nFig. 1.

However, by combining and to\nform an augmented system matrix, (4), the integration overhead\ncan be eliminated at the expense of obtaining only the cyclic\nsteady-state description\nor\n(4)\nConsider the solution of the state vector, (4), at the transition\ntime between modes 1 & 2, (denoted )\n(5)\nwhere are the initial conditions of the cyclic mode, and\n.

AVERAGED STATE-VARIABLES\nIn order to obtain the average steady-state output voltage of\nthe converter, the mean values of the state-variables over a com-\nplete cycle are found from\n(10)\nAgain, the requirement for integration impedes efficient\nanalysis of the system. However, by augmenting the state-vector\nwith , the solution of the resulting system\ncan be simplified. From [1], the dynamics of the converter\nduring the mode of a cycle are given by\n(11)\nwith the resulting dynamic description\nor\n(12)\nFOSTER et al.:CYCLIC-AVERAGING 987\nThe initial conditions for the cyclic mode are now:\n(13)\nIn a manner similar to that presented in the previous section,\nthe averaged state-vector is obtained as follows\n(14)\nfrom which the average output voltages (or currents) of\nswitching converters, together with the average voltages (or\ncurrents) across (or through) the reactive components in the\ncircuit, , are determined.\nIV. STATE-SPACE MODEL OF LCC VOLTAGE\nOUTPUT CONVERTER\nTo demonstrate the attributes of cyclic averaging for the anal-\nysis of resonant power converters, a 3rd order LCC voltage\noutput converter, is considered, Fig. 1. The optional filter in-\nductor, is often included for use in high-power converters\nand those which require a low output current ripple, and facili-\ntates a reduction in the size of the output filter capacitor. How-\never, to limit the physical size of the converter, and to reduce\ncost, the filter inductor is usually omitted. This does, however,\nsignificantly complicate the analysis since the voltage across the\nparallel resonant capacitor is clamped at the output voltage when\nthe rectifier conducts, and cannot be considered to be sinusoidal\n(as in a FMA analysis). The treatment presented in the paper is\nsolely concerned with the converter operating without a filter\ninductor.\nTo obtain the state-variable equations that describe the con-\nverter operation (omitting ), the circuit is first partitioned into\ntwo sub-systems, [2]. The filter capacitor and load are repre-\nsented by a \u2018slow\u2019 sub-system and the resonant circuit by a \u2018fast\u2019\nsub-system; the interaction between the two being through a rec-\ntifier coupling equation. The differential equations describing\nthe fast sub-system are\n(15)\nand, similarly, for the slow sub-system\n(16)\nThe coupling equation is obtained by equating the voltages\nacross both sides of the rectifier; viz:\n(17)\nwhere is the rectifier voltage drop. Assuming the parasitic\nresistance of each capacitor has a negligible effect, (17) reduces\nto\n(18)\nfrom which the dynamic equation describing the parallel capac-\nitor voltage is obtained as\n(19)\nSubstituting (15) and (16) into (19) for the appropriate capac-\nitor currents, and solving for the rectifier current, , yields\n(20)\nThe combined state-space model and coupling equation are\nthen given by (21) and (22), shown at the bottom of the page.\nNote: For use in signal-conservative simulation packages, e.g.,\nSimulink, modifications to the coupling equation are required\nto ensure the rectifier commutates correctly, see [3].\nV. DERIVATION OF CYCLIC MODEL\nAnalysis of the behavior of the third-order voltage output\nLCC converter, Fig. 1, shows that for switching frequencies\nabove, and in the region of, the resonant frequency, six oper-\nating modes are present in each periodic cycle, with respect\n(21)\n(22)\n988 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS, VOL. 18, NO. 4,JULY 2003\nto the polarity of the input voltage and the state of the recti-\nfier current, Fig. 2. Although other mode sequences can occur,\nfor operation well above resonance, these impart poor switch\npower-factor characteristics, and are not normally considered\nfor design purposes.\nThe derivation of the piece-wise linear equations required for\ncyclic averaging is complicated by the requirement for calcu-\nlating the magnitude of the rectifier current, (i.e. is a\nnonlinear function of and ). However, a simplified ex-\npression for can be obtained by noting that the filter capac-\nitor, , is much larger in value than the parallel capacitor, ,\nfor a \u2018ripple-free\u2019 output voltage. Hence, in (22) can be ne-\nglected. Thus\n(23)\nthe dynamic matrices, , and the input matrices, , are found\nby substitution of (23) into (21) and taking account of the po-\nlarity of the input voltage and the direction of the rectifier cur-\nrent. In particular, for operation in mode 1 ( , ) as\n(24), shown at the bottom of the page, and the coupling equation\nis\n(25)\nSimilarly, the modal equations describing mode 2 ( ,\n) are\n(26)\nwhilst for mode 3 ( , ) as (27), shown at the bottom\nof the page.\nDue to symmetry, the modal matrices for modes 4,5,6 are\nequivalent to those given previously, i.e.\n(28)\nThe time-periods associated with each mode are derived\nfrom an equivalent circuit based on a modified Rectifier-Com-\npensated Fundamental Mode Analysis (RCFMA) [4] technique.\nThe equivalent circuit models the combined nonlinear effects\nof the bridge rectifier and the output filter, by an equivalent\nresistance, , and capacitance, , Fig. 3, is described by\n(24)\n(27)\n(29)\nFOSTER et al.:CYCLIC-AVERAGING 989\nFig. 3. Equivalent circuit of an LCC voltage output converter.\n(29), shown at the bottom of the previous page. The converter\nis analyzed by assuming the action of the rectifier is to clamp\nthe parallel capacitor voltage (to ) when the rectifier is con-\nducting. The parallel capacitor voltage can then be described by\n(30), shown at the bottom of the page, where\nand is the input current to the converter, is the switching\nfrequency, and is the parallel capacitor charging angle.\nThe duty-cycle for mode 1 is found by assuming the\noutput voltage is ripple free. Hence, when the bridge rectifier\nis conducting the current flowing through is negligible. The\ncurrent flowing through the rectifier is then equal to the inductor\ncurrent, i.e. . The time is defined as the time at\nwhich , and can be derived by finding the impedance of\nthe equivalent circuit in Fig. 3\n(31)\nwhere . is obtained from the polar\nrepresentation of (31) and is normalized by dividing by\n(32)\nThe duty-cycle for mode 2 is found from the integral\n(33)\nwhich describes the parallel capacitor voltage when . By\nnoting that at time , and at time ,\n, (33) can be solved for . The duty-cycle is then\ngiven by\n(34)\nFig. 4.

(a) Equivalent circuit of resonant inductor and (b) L versus frequency.\nVI. SIMULATION AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nThe cyclic averaging methodology is now employed to\nrapidly predict the steady-state output voltage of a converter\nmodel, and the accuracy of the results is assessed. A benchmark\nconverter has been designed to provide an output voltage of\n150 V at a nominal operating frequency of 160 kHz, with an\ninput voltage of 350 V. The resulting circuit component values\nare H (measured), nF, pF,\nF and .\nFig. 4 compares the output voltage obtained by simulating\nthe state-space model to steady-state (20 ms) to that predicted\nby cyclic-averaging, for a variety of loads. As will be evident,\nthe results compare favorably, although the data obtained using\ncyclic averaging took only 1\/10 000th of the execution time of\nthe state-space model. (However, of course, only steady-state\nresults are obtained).\nIn order to determine the accuracy of the proposed cyclic-av-\neraging methodology for determining the steady-state operation\nof a practical converter, a half-bridge LCC voltage output con-\nverter is having the component values given previously, is con-\nsidered. Fig. 5 compares the output voltage of the experimental\nconverter with predictions from cyclic averaging, for a range of\nloads.\nThe discrepancy between the cyclic averaging predictions\nand the experimental results is indicative of a shift in resonant\nfrequency, and is attributed to the self-capacitance of the\nresonant inductor . The stray-capacitance of the resonant\ninductor was measured as 52 pF at resonance. To incorporate\nthe effects of the self-capacitance, the parallel combination of\nand its parasitic capacitance is modeled by an equivalent,\nfrequency dependent, inductance (36), as illustrated in\nFig. 6.\nThe value of the equivalent inductance, , is obtained from\nthe equivalent impedance of the parallel and combination\nwhere\n(36)\nThe predicted output voltage of the converter the after the\nmodified value of the inductance is incorporated into the cyclic\nFig. 7. Comparison between output voltage predicted by compensated cyclic\naveraging (cyc) and measured on the experimental converter (exp).\naveraging algorithm shown in Fig. 7; which again includes the\nmeasurements for comparison purposes. The improved corre-\nlation between the theoretical predictions and the experimental\ndata is self-evident.\nVII. COMPONENT STRESSES\nDuring the converter design process, it is necessary to con-\nsider the peak voltage and current stresses which are imposed\non the resonant components, with a view to establishing the re-\nquired component ratings. It is now shown that cyclic-averaging\nprovides a convenient, accurate, and computationally efficient\nmethod for addressing this issue.\nReferring once again to Fig. 2, it can be seen that the peak\nvoltage across the series capacitor, , occurs at the instant of\ntime when the current that flows through the resonant inductor\npasses through zero. The time at which is ob-\ntained from , (32). Substitution of into (9) provides\nthe following expression for :\n(37)\nFOSTER et al.:CYCLIC-AVERAGING 991\nFig. 8. Change in inductor current waveform with increasing frequency.\nFig. 9. Equivalent circuit of LCC voltage-output converter operating in mode\n3.\nFundamental mode analysis (FMA) techniques can be used to\npredict the time at which reaches its maximum value. How-\never, as the switching frequency is increased, the inductor cur-\nrent waveforms become less sinusoidal and increasingly trian-\ngular, see Fig. 8; and FMA thus becomes less accurate.\nIn order to improve the accuracy of the predictions, therefore,\nthe inductor current is modeled by considering the \u2018equivalent\ncircuit\u2019 shown in Fig. 9. This is justified since the majority of\nthe inductor current flows through the rectifier, and hence,\nhas a negligible effect on the current. Also, if the filter capacitor,\n, is assumed to be sufficiently large that there is zero output\nvoltage ripple, the load resistance can be replaced by an equiva-\nlent current sink of value , where and\nis the output voltage averaged over one cycle in steady-state,\n(14).\nThe dynamical equations governing the operation of the con-\nverter in mode 3 are then\n(38)\nTo simplify the mathematics, both of the capacitor voltages\ncan be represented by one state-variable, by summing their con-\ntribution to produce a combined capacitor voltage [5]. Rep-\nresented in state-space form, the voltage combination produces\nthe new system description (39)\n(39)\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 10.

As shown in Fig. 8, at high switching fre-\nquencies (with respect to the resonant frequency) the inductor\ncurrent does not have sufficient time to reach its \u2018natural\u2019 peak\nvalue, and the waveform becomes increasingly triangular (with\nincreasing frequency). Equation (41) is, therefore, modified to\naccount for this effect by limiting the maximum value at which\ncan occur, resulting in (42), shown at the top of the\npage. From (42) it is readily shown that the maximum inductor\ncurrent is then given by\n(43)\nThe steady-state stresses on the resonant converter compo-\nnents then follow from (37) and (43). Fig. 10 compares the mea-\nsured of stresses on the experimental converter with theoret-\nical predictions, all predictions utilising the modified inductance\nvalue, (36). For completeness, results obtained from both Spice\nsimulations and RCFMA [4] are also included.\nAgain, it will be seen that good correlation exists between\npredictions generated using cyclic averaging and those deduced\nfrom Spice. However, the execution time to obtain the data by\ncyclic-averaging was approximately 1\/10 000 times that which\nwas required for the Spice simulations.\nVIII. CONCLUSION\nThe paper has described the application of a cyclic-averaging\nbased technique to facilitate the rapid analysis and design\nof high order resonant power converters. It has been shown\nthat cyclic-averaging is an appropriate method for obtaining\nsteady-state performance predictions of the current and voltage\nwaveforms, as evidenced by comparisons with state-space\nand Spice based simulations and measurements made on\nan experimental converter. It has also been shown that the\nmethod takes only 1\/10 000th of the computation time of\nSpice. Moreover, a comparison of results has shown that cyclic\naveraging provides reliable predictions of voltage and current\nstresses on the resonant circuit components.\nREFERENCES\n[1] H. R.
